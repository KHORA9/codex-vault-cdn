The German work is difficult\r\nreading even for Germans. To most English and American students of\r\ngeographic environment it is a closed book, a treasure-house bolted and\r\nbarred. Ratzel himself realized \"that any English form could not be a\r\nliteral translation, but must be adapted to the Anglo-Celtic and\r\nespecially to the Anglo-American mind.\" The writer undertook, with\r\nRatzel's approval, to make such an adapted restatement of the\r\nprinciples, with a view to making them pass current where they are now\r\nunknown. But the initial stages of the work revealed the necessity of a\r\nradical modification of the original plan.\r\n\r\nRatzel performed the great service of placing anthropo-geography on a\r\nsecure scientific basis. He had his forerunners in Montesquieu,\r\nAlexander von Humboldt, Buckle, Ritter, Kohl, Peschel and others; but he\r\nfirst investigated the subject from the modern scientific point of view,\r\nconstructed his system according to the principles of evolution, and\r\nbased his conclusions on world-wide inductions, for which his\r\npredecessors did not command the data. To this task he brought thorough\r\ntraining as a naturalist, broad reading and travel, a profound and\r\noriginal intellect, and amazing fertility of thought. Yet the field\r\nwhich he had chosen was so vast, and its material so complex, that even\r\nhis big mental grasp could not wholly compass it. His conclusions,\r\ntherefore, are not always exhaustive or final.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the very fecundity of his ideas often left him no time to test\r\nthe validity of his principles. He enunciates one brilliant\r\ngeneralization after another. Sometimes he reveals the mind of a seer or\r\npoet, throwing out conclusions which are highly suggestive, on the face\r\nof them convincing, but which on examination prove untenable, or at\r\nbest must be set down as unproven or needing qualification. But these\r\nwere just the slag from the great furnace of his mind, slag not always\r\nworthless. Brilliant and far-reaching as were his conclusions, he did\r\nnot execute a well-ordered plan. Rather he grew with his work, and his\r\nwork and its problems grew with him. He took a mountain-top view of\r\nthings, kept his eyes always on the far horizon, and in the splendid\r\nsweep of his scientific conceptions sometimes overlooked the details\r\nnear at hand. Herein lay his greatness and his limitation.\r\n\r\nThese facts brought the writer face to face with a serious problem.\r\nRatzel's work needed to be tested, verified. The only solution was to go\r\nover the whole field from the beginning, making research for the data as\r\nfrom the foundation, and checking off the principles against the facts.\r\nThis was especially necessary, because it was not always obvious that\r\nRatzel had based his inductions on sufficiently broad data; and his\r\npublished work had been open to the just criticism of inadequate\r\ncitation of authorities. It was imperative, moreover, that any\r\ninvestigation of geographic environment for the English-speaking world\r\nshould meet its public well supported both by facts and authorities,\r\nbecause that public had not previously known a Ritter or a Peschel.\r\n\r\nThe writer's own investigation revealed the fact that Ratzel's\r\nprinciples of anthropo-geography did not constitute a complete,\r\nwell-proportioned system. Some aspects of the subject had been developed\r\nexhaustively, these of course the most important; but others had been\r\ntreated inadequately, others were merely a hint or an inference, and yet\r\nothers were represented by an hiatus. It became necessary, therefor, to\r\nwork up certain important themes with a thoroughness commensurate with\r\ntheir significance, to reduce the scale of others, and to fill up\r\ncertain gaps with original contributions to the science. Always it was\r\nnecessary to clarify the original statement, where that was adhered to,\r\nand to throw it into the concrete form of expression demanded by the\r\nAnglo-Saxon mind.\r\n\r\nOne point more. The organic theory of society and state permeates the\r\n_Anthropo-geographie_, because Ratzel formulated his principles at a\r\ntime when Herbert Spencer exercised a wide influence upon European\r\nthought. This theory, now generally abandoned by sociologists, had to be\r\neliminated from any restatement of Ratzel's system. Though it was\r\napplied in the original often in great detail, it stood there\r\nnevertheless rather as a scaffolding around the finished edifice; and\r\nthe stability of the structure, after this scaffolding is removed shows\r\nhow extraneous to the whole it was. The theory performed, however, a\r\ngreat service in impressing Ratzel's mind with the life-giving\r\nconnection between land and people.\r\n\r\nThe writer's own method of research has been to compare typical peoples\r\nof all races and all stages of cultural development, living under\r\nsimilar geographic conditions. If these peoples of different ethnic\r\nstocks but similar environments manifested similar or related social,\r\neconomic or historical development, it was reasonable to infer that such\r\nsimilarities were due to environment and not to race. Thus, by extensive\r\ncomparison, the race factor in these problems of two unknown quantities\r\nwas eliminated for certain large classes of social and historical\r\nphenomena.\r\n\r\nThe writer, moreover, has purposely avoided definitions, formulas, and\r\nthe enunciation of hard-and-fast rules; and has refrained from any\r\neffort to delimit the field or define the relation of this new science\r\nof anthropo-geography to the older sciences. It is unwise to put tight\r\nclothes on a growing child. The eventual form and scope of the science,\r\nthe definition and organization of its material must evolve gradually,\r\nafter long years and many efforts of many workers in the field. The\r\neternal flux of Nature runs through anthropo-geography, and warns\r\nagainst precipitate or rigid conclusions. But its laws are none the less\r\nwell founded because they do not lend themselves to mathematical\r\nfinality of statement. For this reason the writer speaks of geographic\r\nfactors and influences, shuns the word geographic determinant, and\r\nspeaks with extreme caution of geographic control.\r\n\r\nThe present volume is offered to the public with a deep sense of its\r\ninadequacy; with the realization that some of its principles may have to\r\nbe modified or their emphasis altered after wider research; but also\r\nwith the hope that this effort may make the way easier for the scholar\r\nwho shall some day write the ideal treatise on anthropo-geography.\r\n\r\nIn my work on this book I have only one person to thank, the great\r\nmaster who was my teacher and friend during his life, and after his\r\ndeath my inspiration.\r\n\r\nELLEN CHURCHILL SEMPLE.\r\nLOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY,\r\n_January_, 1911.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.

This means not merely that he\r\nis a child of the earth, dust of her dust; but that the earth has\r\nmothered him, fed him, set him tasks, directed his thoughts, confronted\r\nhim with difficulties that have strengthened his body and sharpened his\r\nwits, given him his problems of navigation or irrigation, and at the\r\nsame time whispered hints for their solution. She has entered into his\r\nbone and tissue, into his mind and soul. On the mountains she has given\r\nhim leg muscles of iron to climb the slope; along the coast she has left\r\nthese weak and flabby, but given him instead vigorous development of\r\nchest and arm to handle his paddle or oar. In the river valley she\r\nattaches him to the fertile soil, circumscribes his ideas and ambitions\r\nby a dull round of calm, exacting duties, narrows his outlook to the\r\ncramped horizon of his farm. Up on the wind-swept plateaus, in the\r\nboundless stretch of the grasslands and the waterless tracts of the\r\ndesert, where he roams with his flocks from pasture to pasture and oasis\r\nto oasis, where life knows much hardship but escapes the grind of\r\ndrudgery, where the watching of grazing herd gives him leisure for\r\ncontemplation, and the wide-ranging life a big horizon, his ideas take\r\non a certain gigantic simplicity; religion becomes monotheism, God\r\nbecomes one, unrivalled like the sand of the desert and the grass of the\r\nsteppe, stretching on and on without break or change. Chewing over and\r\nover the cud of his simple belief as the one food of his unfed mind, his\r\nfaith becomes fanaticism; his big spacial ideas, born of that ceaseless\r\nregular wandering, outgrow the land that bred them and bear their\r\nlegitimate fruit in wide imperial conquests.\r\n\r\nMan can no more be scientifically studied apart from the ground which he\r\ntills, or the lands over which he travels, or the seas over which he\r\ntrades, than polar bear or desert cactus can be understood apart from\r\nits habitat. Man's relations to his environment are infinitely more\r\nnumerous and complex than those of the most highly organized plant or\r\nanimal. So complex are they that they constitute a legitimate and\r\nnecessary object of special study. The investigation which they receive\r\nin anthropology, ethnology, sociology and history is piecemeal and\r\npartial, limited as to the race, cultural development, epoch, country or\r\nvariety of geographic conditions taken into account. Hence all these\r\nsciences, together with history so far as history undertakes to explain\r\nthe causes of events, fail to reach a satisfactory solution of their\r\nproblems largely because the geographic factor which enters into them\r\nall has not been thoroughly analyzed. Man has been so noisy about the\r\nway he has \"conquered Nature,\" and Nature has been so silent in her\r\npersistent influence over man, that the geographic factor in the\r\nequation of human development has been overlooked.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stability of geographic factors in history.]\r\n\r\nIn every problem of history there are two main factors, variously stated\r\nas heredity and environment, man and his geographic conditions, the\r\ninternal forces of race and the external forces of habitat. Now the\r\ngeographic element in the long history of human development has been\r\noperating strongly and operating persistently. Herein lies its\r\nimportance. It is a stable force. It never sleeps. This natural\r\nenvironment, this physical basis of history, is for all intents and\r\npurposes immutable in comparison with the other factor in the\r\nproblem--shifting, plastic, progressive, retrogressive man.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Persistent effect of remoteness.]\r\n\r\nHistory tends to repeat itself largely owing to this steady, unchanging\r\ngeographic element. If the ancient Roman consul in far-away Britain\r\noften assumed an independence of action and initiative unknown in the\r\nprovincial governors of Gaul, and if, centuries later, Roman Catholicism\r\nin England maintained a similar independence towards the Holy See, both\r\nfacts have their cause in the remoteness of Britain from the center of\r\npolitical or ecclesiastical power in Rome. If the independence of the\r\nRoman consul in Britain was duplicated later by the attitude of the\r\nThirteen Colonies toward England, and again within the young Republic by\r\nthe headstrong self-reliance, impatient of government authority, which\r\ncharacterized the early Trans-Allegheny commonwealths in their\r\naggressive Indian policy, and led them to make war and conclude treaties\r\nfor the cession of land like sovereign states; and if this attitude of\r\nindependence in the over-mountain men reappeared in a spirit of\r\npolitical defection looking toward secession from the Union and a new\r\ncombination with their British neighbor on the Great Lakes or the\r\nSpanish beyond the Mississippi, these are all the identical effects of\r\ngeographical remoteness made yet more remote by barriers of mountain and\r\nsea. This is the long reach which weakens the arm of authority, no\r\nmatter what the race or country or epoch.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effect of proximity.]\r\n\r\nAs with geographical remoteness, so it is with geographical proximity.\r\nThe history of the Greek peninsula and the Greek people, because of\r\ntheir location at the threshold of the Orient, has contained a\r\nconstantly recurring Asiatic element. This comes out most often as a\r\nnote of warning; like the _motif_ of Ortrud in the opera of\r\n\"Lohengrin,\" it mingles ominously in every chorus of Hellenic\r\nenterprise or paean of Hellenic victory, and finally swells into a\r\nnational dirge at the Turkish conquest of the peninsula. It comes out\r\nin the legendary history of the Argonautic Expedition and the Trojan\r\nWar; in the arrival of Phoenician Cadmus and Phrygian Pelops in\r\nGrecian lands; in the appearance of Tyrian ships on the coast of the\r\nPeloponnesus, where they gather the purple-yielding murex and kidnap\r\nGreek women. It appears more conspicuously in the Asiatic sources of\r\nGreek culture; more dramatically in the Persian Wars, in the retreat\r\nof Xenophon's Ten Thousand, in Alexander's conquest of Asia, and\r\nHellenic domination of Asiatic trade through Syria to the\r\nMediterranean. Again in the thirteenth century the lure of the\r\nLevantine trade led Venice and Genoa to appropriate certain islands\r\nand promontories of Greece as commercial bases nearer to Asia. In 1396\r\nbegins the absorption of Greece into the Asiatic empire of the Turks,\r\nthe long dark eclipse of sunny Hellas, till it issues from the shadow\r\nin 1832 with the achievement of Greek independence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Persistent effect of natural barriers.]\r\n\r\nIf the factor is not one of geographical location, but a natural\r\nbarrier, such as a mountain system or a desert, its effect is just as\r\npersistent. The upheaved mass of the Carpathians served to divide the\r\nwestward moving tide of the Slavs into two streams, diverting one into\r\nthe maritime plain of northern Germany and Poland, the other into the\r\nchannel of the Danube Valley which guided them to the Adriatic and the\r\nfoot of the Alps. This same range checked the westward advance of the\r\nmounted Tartar hordes. The Alps long retarded Roman expansion into\r\ncentral Europe, just as they delayed and obstructed the southward\r\nadvance of the northern barbarians. Only through the partial breaches in\r\nthe wall known as passes did the Alps admit small, divided bodies of the\r\ninvaders, like the Cimbri and Teutons, who arrived, therefore, with\r\nweakened power and at intervals, so that the Roman forces had time to\r\ngather their strength between successive attacks, and thus prolonged the\r\nlife of the declining empire. So in the Middle Ages, the Alpine barrier\r\nfacilitated the resistance of Italy to the German emperors, trying to\r\nenforce their claim upon this ancient seat of the Holy Roman Empire.\r\n\r\nIt was by river-worn valleys leading to passes in the ridge that\r\nEtruscan trader, Roman legion, barbarian horde, and German army crossed\r\nthe Alpine ranges. To-day well-made highways and railroads converge upon\r\nthese valley paths and summit portals, and going is easier; but the Alps\r\nstill collect their toll, now in added tons of coal consumed by engines\r\nand in higher freight rates, instead of the ancient imposts of physical\r\nexhaustion paid by pack animal and heavily accoutred soldier. Formerly\r\nthese mountains barred the weak and timid; to-day they bar the poor, and\r\nforbid transit to all merchandise of large bulk and small value which\r\ncan not pay the heavy transportation charges. Similarly, the wide\r\nbarrier of the Rockies, prior to the opening of the first overland\r\nrailroad, excluded all but strong-limbed and strong-hearted pioneers\r\nfrom the fertile valleys of California and Oregon, just as it excludes\r\ncoal and iron even from the Colorado mines, and checks the free\r\nmovement of laborers to the fields and factories of California, thereby\r\ntightening the grip of the labor unions upon Pacific coast industries.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Persistent effect of nature-made highways.]\r\n\r\nAs the surface of the earth presents obstacles, so it offers channels\r\nfor the easy movement of humanity, grooves whose direction determines\r\nthe destination of aimless, unplanned migrations, and whose termini\r\nbecome, therefore, regions of historical importance. Along these\r\nnature-made highways history repeats itself. The maritime plain of\r\nPalestine has been an established route of commerce and war from the\r\ntime of Sennacherib to Napoleon.[1] The Danube Valley has admitted to\r\ncentral Europe a long list of barbarian invaders, covering the period\r\nfrom Attila the Hun to the Turkish besiegers of Vienna in 1683. The\r\nhistory of the Danube Valley has been one of warring throngs, of\r\nshifting political frontiers, and unassimilated races; but as the river\r\nis a great natural highway, every neighboring state wants to front upon\r\nit and strives to secure it as a boundary.\r\n\r\nThe movements of peoples constantly recur to these old grooves. The\r\nunmarked path of the voyageur's canoe, bringing out pelts from Lake\r\nSuperior to the fur market at Montreal, is followed to-day by whaleback\r\nsteamers with their cargoes of Manitoba wheat. To-day the Mohawk\r\ndepression through the northern Appalachians diverts some of Canada's\r\ntrade from the Great Lakes to the Hudson, just as in the seventeenth\r\ncentury it enabled the Dutch at New Amsterdam and later the English at\r\nAlbany to tap the fur trade of Canada's frozen forests. Formerly a line\r\nof stream and portage, it carries now the Erie Canal and New York\r\nCentral Railroad.[2] Similarly the narrow level belt of land extending\r\nfrom the mouth of the Hudson to the eastern elbow of the lower Delaware,\r\ndefining the outer margin of the rough hill country of northern New\r\nJersey and the inner margin of the smooth coastal plain, has been from\r\nsavage days such a natural thoroughfare. Here ran the trail of the\r\nLenni-Lenapi Indians; a little later, the old Dutch road between New\r\nAmsterdam and the Delaware trading-posts; yet later the King's Highway\r\nfrom New York to Philadelphia. In 1838 it became the route of the\r\nDelaware and Raritan Canal, and more recently of the Pennsylvania\r\nRailroad between New York and Philadelphia.[3]\r\n\r\nThe early Aryans, in their gradual dispersion over northwestern India,\r\nreached the Arabian Sea chiefly by a route running southward from the\r\nIndus-Ganges divide, between the eastern border of the Rajputana Desert\r\nand the western foot of the Aravalli Hills. The streams flowing down\r\nfrom this range across the thirsty plains unite to form the Luni River,\r\nwhich draws a dead-line to the advance of the desert. Here a smooth and\r\nwell-watered path brought the early Aryans of India to a fertile coast\r\nalong the Gulf of Cambay.[4] In the palmy days of the Mongol Empire\r\nduring the seventeenth century, and doubtless much earlier, it became an\r\nestablished trade route between the sea and the rich cities of the upper\r\nGanges.[5] Recently it determined the line of the Rajputana Railroad\r\nfrom the Gulf of Cambay to Delhi.[6] Barygaza, the ancient seaboard\r\nterminus of this route, appears in Pliny's time as the most famous\r\nemporium of western India, the resort of Greek and Arab merchants.[7] It\r\nreappears later in history with its name metamorphosed to Baroche or\r\nBroach, where in 1616 the British established a factory for trade,[8]\r\nbut is finally superseded, under Portuguese and English rule, by nearby\r\nSurat. Thus natural conditions fix the channels in which the stream of\r\nhumanity most easily moves, determine within certain limits the\r\ndirection of its flow, the velocity and volume of its current. Every new\r\nflood tends to fit itself approximately into the old banks, seeks first\r\nthese lines of least resistance, and only when it finds them blocked or\r\npre-empted does it turn to more difficult paths.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Regions of historical similarity.]\r\n\r\nGeographical environment, through the persistence of its influence,\r\nacquires peculiar significance. Its effect is not restricted to a given\r\nhistorical event or epoch, but, except when temporarily met by some\r\nstrong counteracting force, tends to make itself felt under varying\r\nguise in all succeeding history. It is the permanent element in the\r\nshifting fate of races. Islands show certain fundamental points of\r\nagreement which can be distinguished in the economic, ethnic and\r\nhistorical development of England, Japan, Melanesian Fiji, Polynesian\r\nNew Zealand, and pre-historic Crete. The great belt of deserts and\r\nsteppes extending across the Old World gives us a vast territory of rare\r\nhistorical uniformity. From time immemorial they have borne and bred\r\ntribes of wandering herdsmen; they have sent out the invading hordes\r\nwho, in successive waves of conquest, have overwhelmed the neighboring\r\nriver lowlands of Eurasia and Africa. They have given birth in turn to\r\nScythians, Indo-Aryans, Avars, Huns, Saracens, Tartars and Turks, as to\r\nthe Tuareg tribes of the Sahara, the Sudanese and Bantu folk of the\r\nAfrican grasslands. But whether these various peoples have been Negroes,\r\nHamites, Semites, Indo-Europeans or Mongolians, they have always been\r\npastoral nomads. The description given by Herodotus of the ancient\r\nScythians is applicable in its main features to the Kirghis and Kalmuck\r\nwho inhabit the Caspian plains to-day. The environment of this dry\r\ngrassland operates now to produce the same mode of life and social\r\norganization as it did 2,400 years ago; stamps the cavalry tribes of\r\nCossacks as it did the mounted Huns, energizes its sons by its dry\r\nbracing air, toughens them by its harsh conditions of life, organizes\r\nthem into a mobilized army, always moving with its pastoral\r\ncommissariat. Then when population presses too hard upon the meager\r\nsources of subsistence, when a summer drought burns the pastures and\r\ndries up the water-holes, it sends them forth on a mission of conquest,\r\nto seek abundance in the better watered lands of their agricultural\r\nneighbors. Again and again the productive valleys of the Hoangho, Indus,\r\nGanges, Tigris and Euphrates, Nile, Volga, Dnieper and Danube have been\r\nbrought into subjection by the imperious nomads of arid Asia, just as\r\nthe \"hoe-people\" of the Niger and upper Nile have so often been\r\nconquered by the herdsmen of the African grasslands. Thus, regardless of\r\nrace or epoch--Hyksos or Kaffir--history tends to repeat itself in these\r\nrainless tracts, and involves the better watered districts along their\r\nborders when the vast tribal movements extend into these peripheral\r\nlands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DENSITY OF POPULATION IN EASTERN HEMISPHERE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DENSITY OF POPULATION IN WESTERN HEMISPHERE]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Climatic influences.]\r\n\r\nClimatic influences are persistent, often obdurate in their control.\r\nArid regions permit agriculture and sedentary life only through\r\nirrigation. The economic prosperity of Egypt to-day depends as\r\ncompletely upon the distribution of the Nile waters as in the days of\r\nthe Pharaohs. The mantle of the ancient Egyptian priest has fallen upon\r\nthe modern British engineer. Arctic explorers have succeeded only by\r\nimitating the life of the Eskimos, adopting their clothes, food, fuel,\r\ndwellings, and mode of travel. Intense cold has checked both native and\r\nRussian development over that major portion of Siberia lying north of\r\nthe mean annual isotherm of degree C. (32 degrees F.); and it has had a\r\nlike effect in the corresponding part of Canada. (Compare maps pages 8\r\nand 9.) It allows these sub-arctic lands scant resources and a\r\npopulation of less than two to the square mile. Even with the intrusion\r\nof white colonial peoples, it perpetuates the savage economy of the\r\nnative hunting tribes, and makes the fur trader their modern exploiter,\r\nwhether he be the Cossack tribute-gatherer of the lower Lena River, or\r\nthe factor of the Hudson Bay Company. The assimilation tends to be\r\nethnic as well as economic, because the severity of the climate excludes\r\nthe white woman. The debilitating effects of heat and humidity, aided by\r\ntropical diseases, soon reduce intruding peoples to the dead level of\r\neconomic inefficiency characteristic of the native races. These, as the\r\nfittest, survive and tend to absorb the new-comers, pointing to\r\nhybridization as the simplest solution of the problem of tropical\r\ncolonization.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The relation of geography to history.]\r\n\r\nThe more the comparative method is applied to the study of\r\nhistory--and this includes a comparison not only of different\r\ncountries, but also of successive epochs in the same country--the more\r\napparent becomes the influence of the soil in which humanity is\r\nrooted, the more permanent and necessary is that influence seen to be.\r\nGeography's claim to make scientific investigation of the physical\r\nconditions of historical events is then vindicated. \"Which was there\r\nfirst, geography or history?\" asks Kant. And then comes his answer:\r\n\"Geography lies at the basis of history.\" The two are inseparable.\r\nHistory takes for its field of investigation human events in various\r\nperiods of time; anthropo-geography studies existence in various\r\nregions of terrestrial space. But all historical development takes\r\nplace on the earth's surface, and therefore is more or less molded by\r\nits geographic setting. Geography, to reach accurate conclusions, must\r\ncompare the operation of its factors in different historical periods\r\nand at different stages of cultural development. It therefore regards\r\nhistory in no small part as a succession of geographical factors\r\nembodied in events. Back of Massachusetts' passionate abolition\r\nmovement, it sees the granite soil and boulder-strewn fields of New\r\nEngland; back of the South's long fight for the maintenance of\r\nslavery, it sees the rich plantations of tidewater Virginia and the\r\nteeming fertility of the Mississippi bottom lands. This is the\r\nsignificance of Herder's saying that \"history is geography set into\r\nmotion.\" What is to-day a fact of geography becomes to-morrow a factor\r\nof history. The two sciences cannot be held apart without doing\r\nviolence to both, without dismembering what is a natural, vital whole.\r\nAll historical problems ought to be studied geographically and all\r\ngeographic problems must be studied historically. Every map has its\r\ndate. Those in the Statistical Atlas of the United States showing the\r\ndistribution of population from 1790 to 1890 embody a mass of history\r\nas well as of geography. A map of France or the Russian Empire has a\r\nlong historical perspective; and on the other hand, without that map\r\nno change of ethnic or political boundary, no modification in routes\r\nof communication, no system of frontier defences or of colonization,\r\nno scheme of territorial aggrandizement can be understood.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Multiplicity of geographic factors.]\r\n\r\nThe study of physical environment as a factor in history was\r\nunfortunately brought into disrepute by extravagant and ill-founded\r\ngeneralization, before it became the object of investigation according\r\nto modern scientific methods. And even to-day principles advanced in the\r\nname of anthropo-geography are often superficial, inaccurate, based upon\r\na body of data too limited as to space and time, or couched in terms of\r\nunqualified statement which exposes them to criticism or refutation.\r\nInvestigators in this field, moreover, are prone to get a squint in\r\ntheir eye that makes them see one geographic factor to the exclusion of\r\nthe rest; whereas it belongs to the very nature of physical environment\r\nto combine a whole group of influences, working all at the same time\r\nunder the law of the resolution of forces. In this plexus of influences,\r\nsome operate in one direction and some in another; now one loses its\r\nbeneficent effect like a medicine long used or a garment outgrown;\r\nanother waxes in power, reinforced by a new geographic factor which has\r\nbeen released from dormancy by the expansion of the known world, or the\r\nprogress of invention and of human development.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Evolution of geographic relations.]\r\n\r\nThese complex geographic influences cannot be analyzed and their\r\nstrength estimated except from the standpoint of evolution. That is one\r\nreason these half-baked geographic principles rest heavy on our mental\r\ndigestion. They have been formulated without reference to the\r\nall-important fact that the geographical relations of man, like his\r\nsocial and political organization, are subject to the law of\r\ndevelopment. Just as the embryo state found in the primitive Saxon tribe\r\nhas passed through many phases in attaining the political character of\r\nthe present British Empire, so every stage in this maturing growth has\r\nbeen accompanied or even preceded by a steady evolution of the\r\ngeographic relations of the English people.\r\n\r\nOwing to the evolution of geographic relations, the physical environment\r\nfavorable to one stage of development may be adverse to another, and\r\n_vice versa_. For instance, a small, isolated and protected habitat,\r\nlike that of Egypt, Phoenicia, Crete and Greece, encourages the birth\r\nand precocious growth of civilization; but later it may cramp progress,\r\nand lend the stamp of arrested development to a people who were once the\r\nmodel for all their little world. Open and wind-swept Russia, lacking\r\nthese small, warm nurseries where Nature could cuddle her children, has\r\nbred upon its boundless plains a massive, untutored, homogeneous folk,\r\nfed upon the crumbs of culture that have fallen from the richer tables\r\nof Europe. But that item of area is a variable quantity in the equation.\r\nIt changes its character at a higher stage of cultural development.\r\nConsequently, when the Muscovite people, instructed by the example of\r\nwestern Europe, shall have grown up intellectually, economically and\r\npolitically to their big territory, its area will become a great\r\nnational asset. Russia will come into its own, heir to a long-withheld\r\ninheritance. Many of its previous geographic disadvantages will vanish,\r\nlike the diseases of childhood, while its massive size will dwarf many\r\nprevious advantages of its European neighbors.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Evolution of world relations.]\r\n\r\nThis evolution of geographic relations applies not only to the local\r\nenvironment, but also to the wider world relations of a people. Greeks\r\nand Syrians, English and Japanese, take a different rank among the\r\nnations of the earth to-day from that held by their ancestors 2,000 years\r\nago, simply because the world relations of civilized peoples have been\r\nsteadily expanding since those far-back days of Tyrian and Athenian\r\nsupremacy. The period of maritime discoveries in the fifteenth and\r\nsixteenth centuries shifted the foci of the world relations of European\r\nstates from enclosed seas to the rim of the Atlantic. Venice and Genoa\r\ngave way to Cadiz and Lagos, just as sixteen centuries before Corinth\r\nand Athens had yielded their ascendency to Rome and Ostia. The keen but\r\ncircumscribed trade of the Baltic, which gave wealth and historical\r\npreeminence to Lübeck and the other Hanse Towns of northern Germany from\r\nthe twelfth to the seventeenth century, lost its relative importance\r\nwhen the Atlantic became the maritime field of history. Maritime\r\nleadership passed westward from Lübeck and Stralsund to Amsterdam and\r\nBristol, as the historical horizon widened. England, prior to this\r\nsudden dislocation, lay on the outskirts of civilized Europe, a terminal\r\nland, not a focus. The peripheral location which retarded her early\r\ndevelopment became a source of power when she accumulated sufficient\r\ndensity of population for colonizing enterprises, and when maritime\r\ndiscovery opened a way to trans-oceanic lands.[9]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, local geographic advantages in the old basins remain the\r\nsame, although they are dwarfed by the development of relatively greater\r\nadvantages elsewhere. The broken coastline, limited area and favorable\r\nposition of Greece make its people to-day a nation of seamen, and enable\r\nthem to absorb by their considerable merchant fleet a great part of the\r\ntrade of the eastern Mediterranean,[10] just as they did in the days of\r\nPericles; but that youthful Aegean world which once constituted so large\r\na part of the _oikoumene_, has shrunken to a modest province, and its\r\nhighways to local paths. The coast cities of northern Germany still\r\nmaintain a large commerce in the Baltic, but no longer hold the\r\npre-eminence of the old Hanse Towns. The glory of the Venetian Adriatic\r\nis gone; but that the sea has still a local significance is proven by\r\nthe vast sums spent by Austria and Hungary on their hand-made harbors of\r\nTrieste and Fiume.[11] The analytical geographer, therefore, while\r\nstudying a given combination of geographic forces, must be prepared for\r\na momentous readjustment and a new interplay after any marked turning\r\npoint in the economic, cultural, or world relations of a people.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Interplay of geographic factors.]\r\n\r\nSkepticism as to the effect of geographic conditions upon human\r\ndevelopment is apparently justifiable, owing to the multiplicity of the\r\nunderlying causes and the difficulty of distinguishing between stronger\r\nand weaker factors on the one hand, as between permanent and temporary\r\neffects on the other. We see the result, but find it difficult to state\r\nthe equation producing this result. But the important thing is to avoid\r\nseizing upon one or two conspicuous geographic elements in the problem\r\nand ignoring the rest. The physical environment of a people consists of\r\nall the natural conditions to which they have been subjected, not merely\r\na part. Geography admits no single blanket theory. The slow historical\r\ndevelopment of the Russian folk has been due to many geographic\r\ncauses--to excess of cold and deficiency of rain, an outskirt location\r\non the Asiatic border of Europe exposed to the attacks of nomadic\r\nhordes, a meager and, for the most part, ice-bound coast which was\r\nslowly acquired, an undiversified surface, a lack of segregated regions\r\nwhere an infant civilization might be cradled, and a vast area of\r\nunfenced plains wherein the national energies spread out thin and\r\ndissipated themselves. The better Baltic and Black Sea coasts, the\r\nfertility of its Ukraine soil, and location next to wide-awake Germany\r\nalong the western frontier have helped to accelerate progress, but the\r\nslow-moving body carried too heavy a drag.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Land and sea in co-operation.]\r\n\r\nThe law of the resolutions of forces applies in geography as in the\r\nmovement of planets. Failure to recognize this fact often enables\r\nsuperficial critics of anthropo-geography to make a brave show of\r\nargument. The analysis of these interacting forces and of their various\r\ncombinations requires careful investigation. Let us consider the\r\ninterplay of the forces of land and sea apparent in every country with\r\na maritime location. In some cases a small, infertile, niggardly country\r\nconspires with a beckoning sea to drive its sons out upon the deep; in\r\nothers a wide territory with a generous soil keeps its well-fed children\r\nat home and silences the call of the sea. In ancient Phoenicia and\r\nGreece, in Norway, Finland, New England, in savage Chile and Tierra del\r\nFuego, and the Indian coast district of British Columbia and southern\r\nAlaska, a long, broken shoreline, numerous harbors, outlying islands,\r\nabundant timber for the construction of ships, difficult communication\r\nby land, all tempted the inhabitants to a seafaring life. While the sea\r\ndrew, the land drove in the same direction. There a hilly or mountainous\r\ninterior putting obstacles in the way of landward expansion, sterile\r\nslopes, a paucity of level, arable land, an excessive or deficient\r\nrainfall withholding from agriculture the reward of tillage--some or all\r\nof these factors combined to compel the inhabitants to seek on the sea\r\nthe livelihood denied by the land. Here both forces worked in the same\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nIn England conditions were much the same, and from the sixteenth century\r\nproduced there a predominant maritime development which was due not\r\nsolely to a long indented coastline and an exceptional location for\r\nparticipating in European and American trade. Its limited island area,\r\nits large extent of rugged hills and chalky soil fit only for pasturage,\r\nand the lack of a really generous natural endowment,[12] made it slow to\r\nanswer the demands of a growing population, till the industrial\r\ndevelopment of the nineteenth century exploited its mineral wealth. So\r\nthe English turned to the sea--to fish, to trade, to colonize. Holland's\r\nconditions made for the same development. She united advantages of\r\ncoastline and position with a small infertile territory, consisting\r\nchiefly of water-soaked grazing lands. When at the zenith of her\r\nmaritime development, a native authority estimated that the soil of\r\nHolland could not support more than one-eighth of her inhabitants. The\r\nmeager products of the land had to be eked out by the harvest of the\r\nsea. Fish assumed an important place in the diet of the Dutch, and when\r\na process of curing it was discovered, laid the foundation of Holland's\r\nexport trade. A geographical location central to the Baltic and North\r\nSea countries, and accessible to France and Portugal, combined with a\r\nposition at the mouth of the great German rivers made it absorb the\r\ncarrying trade of northern Europe.[13] Land and sea coöperated in its\r\nmaritime development.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Land and sea opposed.]\r\n\r\nOften the forces of land and sea are directly opposed. If a country's\r\ngeographic conditions are favorable to agriculture and offer room for\r\ngrowth of population, the land forces prevail, because man is primarily\r\na terrestrial animal. Such a country illustrates what Chisholm, with\r\nAttic nicety of speech, calls \"the influence of bread-power on\r\nhistory,\"[14] as opposed to Mahan's sea-power. France, like England, had\r\na long coastline, abundant harbors, and an excellent location for\r\nmaritime supremacy and colonial expansion; but her larger area and\r\ngreater amount of fertile soil put off the hour of a redundant\r\npopulation such as England suffered from even in Henry VIII's time.\r\nMoreover, in consequence of steady continental expansion from the\r\ntwelfth to the eighteenth century and a political unification which made\r\nits area more effective for the support of the people, the French of\r\nRichelieu's time, except those from certain districts, took to the sea,\r\nnot by national impulse as did the English and Dutch, but rather under\r\nthe spur of government initiative. They therefore achieved far less in\r\nmaritime trade and colonization.[15] In ancient Palestine, a long\r\nstretch of coast, poorly equipped with harbors but accessible to the\r\nrich Mediterranean trade, failed to offset the attraction of the gardens\r\nand orchards of the Jezreel Valley and the pastures of the Judean hills,\r\nor to overcome the land-born predilections and aptitudes of the\r\ndesert-bred Jews. Similarly, the river-fringed peninsulas of Virginia\r\nand Maryland, opening wide their doors to the incoming sea, were\r\npowerless, nevertheless, to draw the settlers away from the riotous\r\nproductiveness of the wide tidewater plains. Here again the geographic\r\nforce of the land outweighed that of the sea and became the dominant\r\nfactor in directing the activities of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe two antagonistic geographic forces may be both of the land, one born\r\nof a country's topography, the other of its location. Switzerland's\r\nhistory has for centuries shown the conflict of two political policies,\r\none a policy of cantonal and communal independence, which has sprung\r\nfrom the division of that mountainous country into segregated districts,\r\nand the other one of political centralization, dictated by the necessity\r\nfor coöperation to meet the dangers of Switzerland's central location\r\nmid a circle of larger and stronger neighbors. Local geographic\r\nconditions within the Swiss territory fixed the national ideal as a\r\nleague of \"sovereign cantons,\" to use the term of their constitution,\r\nenjoying a maximum of individual rights and privileges, and tolerating a\r\nminimum of interference from the central authority. Here was physical\r\ndismemberment coupled with mutual political repulsion. But a location at\r\nthe meeting place of French, German, Austrian and Italian frontiers laid\r\nupon them the distasteful necessity of union within to withstand\r\naggressions crowding upon them from without. Hence the growth of the\r\nSwiss constitution since 1798 has meant a fight of the Confederation\r\nagainst the canton in behalf of general rights, expanding the functions\r\nof the central government, contracting those of canton and commune.[16]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Local and remote geographic factors.]\r\n\r\nEvery country forms an independent whole, and as such finds its national\r\nhistory influenced by its local climate, soil, relief, its location\r\nwhether inland or maritime, its river highways, and its boundaries of\r\nmountain, sea, or desert. But it is also a link in a great chain of\r\nlands, and therefore may feel a shock or vibration imparted at the\r\nremotest end. The gradual desiccation of western Asia which took a fresh\r\nstart about 2,000 years ago caused that great exodus and displacement of\r\npeoples known as the _Völkerwanderung_, and thus contributed to the\r\ndownfall of Rome; it was one factor in the Saxon conquest of Britain and\r\nthe final peopling of central Europe. The impact of the Turkish hordes\r\nhurling themselves against the defenses of Constantinople in 1453 was\r\nfelt only forty years afterward by the far-off shores of savage America.\r\nEarlier still it reached England as the revival of learning, and it gave\r\nPortugal a shock which started its navigators towards the Cape of Good\r\nHope in their search for a sea route to India. The history of South\r\nAfrica is intimately connected with the Isthmus of Suez. It owes its\r\nPortuguese, Dutch, and English populations to that barrier on the\r\nMediterranean pathway to the Orient; its importance as a way station on\r\nthe outside route to India fluctuates with every crisis in the history\r\nof Suez.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Direct and indirect effects of environment.]\r\n\r\nThe geographic factors in history appear now as conspicuous direct\r\neffects of environment, such as the forest warfare of the American\r\nIndian or the irrigation works of the Pueblo tribes, now as a group of\r\nindirect effects, operating through the economic, social and political\r\nactivities of a people. These remoter secondary results are often of\r\nsupreme importance; they are the ones which give the final stamp to the\r\nnational temperament and character, and yet in them the causal\r\nconnection between environment and development is far from obvious. They\r\nhave, therefore, presented pitfalls to the precipitate theorizer. He has\r\neither interpreted them as the direct effect of some geographic cause\r\nfrom which they were wholly divorced and thus arrived at conclusions\r\nwhich further investigation failed to sustain; or seeing no direct and\r\nobvious connection, he has denied the possibility of a generalization.\r\n\r\nMontesquieu ascribes the immutability of religion, manners, custom and\r\nlaws in India and other Oriental countries to their warm climate.[17]\r\nBuckle attributes a highly wrought imagination and gross superstition to\r\nall people, like those of India, living in the presence of great\r\nmountains and vast plains, knowing Nature only in its overpowering\r\naspects, which excite the fancy and paralyze reason. He finds, on the\r\nother hand, an early predominance of reason in the inhabitants of a\r\ncountry like ancient Greece, where natural features are on a small\r\nscale, more comprehensible, nearer the measure of man himself.[18] The\r\nscientific geographer, grown suspicious of the omnipotence of climate\r\nand cautious of predicating immediate psychological effects which are\r\neasy to assert but difficult to prove, approaches the problem more\r\nindirectly and reaches a different solution. He finds that geographic\r\nconditions have condemned India to isolation. On the land side, a great\r\nsweep of high mountains has restricted intercourse with the interior; on\r\nthe sea side, the deltaic swamps of the Indus and Ganges Rivers and an\r\nunbroken shoreline, backed by mountains on the west of the peninsula and\r\nby coastal marshes and lagoons on the east, have combined to reduce its\r\naccessibility from the ocean. The effect of such isolation is ignorance,\r\nsuperstition, and the early crystallization of thought and custom.\r\nIgnorance involves the lack of material for comparison, hence a\r\nrestriction of the higher reasoning processes, and an unscientific\r\nattitude of mind which gives imagination free play. In contrast, the\r\naccessibility of Greece and its focal location in the ancient world made\r\nit an intellectual clearing-house for the eastern Mediterranean. The\r\ngeneral information gathered there afforded material for wide\r\ncomparison. It fed the brilliant reason of the Athenian philosopher and\r\nthe trained imagination which produced the masterpieces of Greek art and\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Indirect mental effects.]\r\n\r\nHeinrich von Treitschke, in his recent \"Politik,\" imitates the direct\r\ninference of Buckle when he ascribes the absence of artistic and poetic\r\ndevelopment in Switzerland and the Alpine lands to the overwhelming\r\naspect of nature there, its majestic sublimity which paralyzes the\r\nmind.[19] He reinforces his position by the fact that, by contrast, the\r\nlower mountains and hill country of Swabia, Franconia and Thuringia,\r\nwhere nature is gentler, stimulating, appealing, and not overpowering,\r\nhave produced many poets and artists. The facts are incontestable. They\r\nreappear in France in the geographical distribution of the awards made\r\nby the Paris _Salon_ of 1896. Judged by these awards, the rough\r\nhighlands of Savoy, Alpine Provence, the massive eastern Pyrenees, and\r\nthe Auvergne Plateau, together with the barren peninsula of Brittany,\r\nare singularly lacking in artistic instinct, while art nourishes in all\r\nthe river lowlands of France. Moreover, French men of letters, by the\r\ndistribution of their birthplaces, are essentially products of fluvial\r\nvalleys and plains, rarely of upland and mountain.[20]\r\n\r\nThis contrast has been ascribed to a fundamental ethnic distinction\r\nbetween the Teutonic population of the lowlands and the Alpine or Celtic\r\nstock which survives in the isolation of highland and peninsula, thus\r\nmaking talent an attribute of race. But the Po Valley of northern Italy,\r\nwhose population contains a strong infusion of this supposedly\r\nstultifying Alpine blood, and the neighboring lowlands and hill country\r\nof Tuscany show an enormous preponderance of intellectual and artistic\r\npower over the highlands of the peninsula.[21] Hence the same contrast\r\nappears among different races under like geographic conditions.\r\nMoreover, in France other social phenomena, such as suicide, divorce,\r\ndecreasing birth-rate, and radicalism in politics, show this same\r\nstartling parallelism of geographic distribution,[22] and these cannot\r\nbe attributed to the stimulating or depressing effect of natural scenery\r\nupon the human mind.\r\n\r\nMountain regions discourage the budding of genius because they are areas\r\nof isolation, confinement, remote from the great currents of men and\r\nideas that move along the river valleys. They are regions of much labor\r\nand little leisure, of poverty to-day and anxiety for the morrow, of\r\ntoil-cramped hands and toil-dulled brains. In the fertile alluvial\r\nplains are wealth, leisure, contact with many minds, large urban centers\r\nwhere commodities and ideas are exchanged. The two contrasted\r\nenvironments produce directly certain economic and social results,\r\nwhich, in turn, become the causes of secondary intellectual and artistic\r\neffects. The low mountains of central Germany which von Treitschke cites\r\nas homes of poets and artists, owing to abundant and varied mineral\r\nwealth, are the seats of active industries and dense populations,[23]\r\nwhile their low reliefs present no serious obstacle to the numerous\r\nhighways across them. They, therefore, afford all conditions for\r\nculture.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Indirect effects in differentiation of colonial peoples.]\r\n\r\nLet us take a different example. The rapid modification in physical and\r\nmental constitution of the English transplanted to North America, South\r\nAfrica, Australia and New Zealand has been the result of several\r\ngeographic causes working through the economic and social media; but it\r\nhas been ascribed by Darwin and others to the effect of climate. The\r\nprevailing energy and initiative of colonists have been explained by the\r\nstimulating atmosphere of their new homes. Even Natal has not escaped\r\nthis soft impeachment. But the enterprise of colonials has cropped out,\r\nunder almost every condition of heat and cold, aridity and humidity, of\r\na habitat at sea-level and on high plateau. This blanket theory of\r\nclimate cannot, therefore, cover the case. Careful analysis supersedes\r\nit by a whole group of geographic factors working directly and\r\nindirectly. The first of these was the dividing ocean which, prior to\r\nthe introduction of cheap ocean transportation and bustling steerage\r\nagents, made a basis of artificial selection. Then it was the man of\r\nabundant energy who, cramped by the narrow environment of a Norwegian\r\nfarm or Irish bog, came over to America to take up a quarter-section of\r\nprairie land or rise to the eminence of Boston police sergeant. The\r\nScotch immigrants in America who fought in the Civil War were nearly two\r\ninches taller than the average in the home country.[24] But the ocean\r\nbarrier culled superior qualities of mind and character\r\nalso--independence of political and religious conviction, and the\r\ncourage of those convictions, whether found in royalist or Puritan,\r\nHuguenot or English Catholic.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Indirect effect through isolation.]\r\n\r\nSuch colonists in a remote country were necessarily few and could not be\r\nreadily reinforced from home. Their new and isolated geographical\r\nenvironment favored variation. Heredity passed on the characteristics of\r\na small, highly selected group. The race was kept pure from intermixture\r\nwith the aborigines of the country, owing to the social and cultural\r\nabyss which separated them, and to the steady withdrawal of the natives\r\nbefore the advance of the whites. The homogeneity of island peoples\r\nseems to indicate that individual variations are in time communicated by\r\nheredity to a whole population under conditions of isolation; and in\r\nthis way modifications due to artificial selection and a changed\r\nenvironment become widely spread.\r\n\r\nNor is this all. The modified type soon becomes established, because the\r\nabundance of land at the disposal of the colonists and the consequent\r\nbetter conditions of living encourage a rapid increase of population. A\r\nsecond geographic factor of mere area here begins to operate. Ease in\r\ngaining subsistence, the greater independence of the individual and the\r\nfamily, emancipation from carking care, the hopeful attitude of mind\r\nengendered by the consciousness of an almost unlimited opportunity and\r\ncapacity for expansion, the expectation of large returns upon labor,\r\nand, finally, the profound influence of this hopefulness upon the\r\nnational character, all combined, produce a social rejuvenation of the\r\nrace. New conditions present new problems which call for prompt and\r\noriginal solution, make a demand upon the ingenuity and resourcefulness\r\nof the individual, and therefore work to the same end as his previous\r\nremoval from the paralyzing effect of custom in the old home country.\r\nActivity is youth and sluggishness or paralysis is age. Hence the\r\nenergy, initiative, adaptability, and receptivity to new ideas--all\r\nyouthful qualities--which characterize the Anglo-Saxon American as well\r\nas the English Africander, can be traced back to the stimulating\r\ninfluences, not of a bracing or variable climate, but of the abundant\r\nopportunities offered by a great, rich, unexploited country. Variation\r\nunder new natural conditions, when safe-guarded by isolation, tends to\r\nproduce modification of the colonial type; this is the direct effect of\r\na changed environment. But the new economic and social activities of a\r\ntransplanted people become the vehicle of a mass of indirect geographic\r\ninfluences which contribute to the differentiation of the national\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General importance of indirect effects.]\r\n\r\nThe tendency to overlook such links between conspicuous effects and\r\ntheir remote, less evident geographic causes has been common in\r\ngeographic investigation. This direct rather than indirect approach to\r\nthe heart of the problem has led to false inferences or to the\r\nassumption that reliable conclusions were impossible. Environment\r\ninfluences the higher, mental life of a people chiefly through the\r\nmedium of their economic and social life; hence its ultimate effects\r\nshould be traced through the latter back to the underlying cause. But\r\nrarely has this been done. Even so astute a geographer as Strabo, though\r\nhe recognizes the influence of geographic isolation in differentiating\r\ndialects and customs in Greece,[25] ascribes some national\r\ncharacteristics to the nature of the country, especially to its climate,\r\nand the others to education and institutions. He thinks that the nature\r\nof their respective lands had nothing to do with making the Athenians\r\ncultured, the Spartans and Thebans ignorant; that the predilection for\r\nnatural science in Babylonia and Egypt was not a result of environment\r\nbut of the institutions and education of those countries.[26] But here\r\narise the questions, how far custom and education in their turn depend\r\nupon environment; to what degree natural conditions, molding economic\r\nand political development, may through them fundamentally affect social\r\ncustoms, education, culture, and the dominant intellectual aptitudes of\r\na people. It is not difficult to see, back of the astronomy and\r\nmathematics and hydraulics of Egypt, the far off sweep of the rain-laden\r\nmonsoons against the mountains of Abyssinia and the creeping of the\r\ntawny Nile flood over that river-born oasis.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Indirect political and moral effects.]\r\n\r\nPlutarch states in his \"Solon\" that after the rebellion of Kylon in 612\r\nB.C. the Athenian people were divided into as many political factions as\r\nthere were physical types of country in Attica. The mountaineers, who\r\nwere the poorest party, wanted something like a democracy; the people of\r\nthe plains, comprising the greatest number of rich families, were\r\nclamorous for an oligarchy; the coast population of the south,\r\nintermediate both in social position and wealth, wanted something\r\nbetween the two. The same three-fold division appeared again in 564 B.C.\r\non the usurpation of Peisistratus.[27] Here the connection between\r\ngeographic condition and political opinion is clear enough, though the\r\nlinks are agriculture and commerce. New England's opposition to the War\r\nof 1812, culminating in the threat of secession of the Hartford\r\nConvention, can be traced back through the active maritime trade to the\r\nbroken coastline and unproductive soil of that glaciated country.\r\n\r\nIn all democratic or representative forms of government permitting free\r\nexpression of popular opinion, history shows that division into\r\npolitical parties tends to follow geographical lines of cleavage. In our\r\nown Civil War the dividing line between North and South did not always\r\nrun east and west. The mountain area of the Southern Appalachians\r\nsupported the Union and drove a wedge of disaffection into the heart of\r\nthe South. Mountainous West Virginia was politically opposed to the\r\ntidewater plains of old Virginia, because slave labor did not pay on the\r\nbarren \"upright\" farms of the Cumberland Plateau; whereas, it was\r\nremunerative on the wide fertile plantations of the coastal lowland. The\r\nethics of the question were obscured where conditions of soil and\r\ntopography made the institution profitable. In the mountains, as also in\r\nNew England, a law of diminishing financial returns had for its\r\ncorollary a law of increasing moral insight. In this case, geographic\r\nconditions worked through the medium of direct economic effects to more\r\nimportant political and ethical results.\r\n\r\nThe roots of geographic influence often run far underground before\r\ncoming to the surface, to sprout into some flowering growth; and to\r\ntrace this back to its parent stem is the necessary but not easy task of\r\nthe geographer.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Time element.]\r\n\r\nThe complexity of this problem does not end here. The modification of\r\nhuman development by environment is a natural process; like all other\r\nnatural processes, it involves the cumulative effects of causes\r\noperating imperceptibly but persistently through vast periods of time.\r\nSlowly and deliberately does geography engrave the subtitles to a\r\npeople's history. Neglect of this time element in the consideration of\r\ngeographic influences accounts equally for many an exaggerated assertion\r\nand denial of their power. A critic undertakes to disprove modification\r\nthrough physical environment by showing that it has not produced\r\ntangible results in the last fifty or five hundred years. This attitude\r\nrecalls the early geologists, whose imaginations could not conceive the\r\nvast ages necessary in a scientific explanation of geologic phenomena.\r\n\r\nThe theory of evolution has taught us in science to think in larger\r\nterms of time, so that we no longer raise the question whether European\r\ncolonists in Africa can turn into negroes, though we do find the recent\r\namazing statement that the Yankee, in his tall, gaunt figure, \"the\r\ncolour of his skin, and the formation of his hair, has begun to\r\ndifferentiate himself from his European kinsman and approach the type of\r\nthe aboriginal Indians.\"[28] Evolution tells the story of modification\r\nby a succession of infinitesimal changes, and emphasizes the permanence\r\nof a modification once produced long after the causes for it cease to\r\nact. The mesas of Arizona, the earth sculpture of the Grand Canyon\r\nremain as monuments to the erosive forces which produced them. So a\r\nhabitat leaves upon man no ephemeral impress; it affects him in one way\r\nat a low stage of his development, and differently at a later or higher\r\nstage, because the man himself and his relation to his environment have\r\nbeen modified in the earlier period; but traces of that earlier\r\nadaptation survive in his maturer life. Hence man's relation to his\r\nenvironment must be looked at through the perspective of historical\r\ndevelopment. It would be impossible to explain the history and national\r\ncharacter of the contemporary English solely by their twentieth century\r\nresponse to their environment, because with insular conservatism they\r\ncarry and cherish vestiges of times when their islands represented\r\ndifferent geographic relations from those of to-day. Witness the\r\nwool-sack of the lord chancellor. We cannot understand the location of\r\nmodern Athens, Rome or Berlin from the present day relations of urban\r\npopulations to their environment, because the original choice of these\r\nsites was dictated by far different considerations from those ruling\r\nto-day. In the history of these cities a whole succession of geographic\r\nfactors have in turn been active, each leaving its impress of which the\r\ncities become, as it were, repositories.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effect of a previous habitat.]\r\n\r\nThe importance of this time element for a solution of\r\nanthropo-geographic problems becomes plainer, where a certain locality\r\nhas received an entirely new population, or where a given people by\r\nmigration change their habitat. The result in either case is the same, a\r\nnew combination, new modifications superimposed on old modifications.\r\nAnd it is with this sort of case that anthropo-geography most often has\r\nto deal. So restless has mankind been, that the testimony of history and\r\nethnology is all against the assumption that a social group has ever\r\nbeen subjected to but one type of environment during its long period of\r\ndevelopment from a primitive to a civilized society. Therefore, if we\r\nassert that a people is the product of the country which it inhabits at\r\na given time, we forget that many different countries which its forbears\r\noccupied have left their mark on the present race in the form of\r\ninherited aptitudes and traditional customs acquired in those remote\r\nancestral habitats. The Moors of Granada had passed through a wide range\r\nof ancestral experiences; they bore the impress of Asia, Africa and\r\nEurope, and on their expulsion from Spain carried back with them to\r\nMorocco traces of their peninsula life.\r\n\r\nA race or tribe develops certain characteristics in a certain region,\r\nthen moves on, leaving the old abode but not all the accretions of\r\ncustom, social organization and economic method there acquired. These\r\ntravel on with the migrant people; some are dropped, others are\r\npreserved because of utility, sentiment or mere habit. For centuries\r\nafter the settlement of the Jews in Palestine, traces of their pastoral\r\nlife in the grasslands of Mesopotamia could be discerned in their social\r\nand political organization, in their ritual and literature. Survivals of\r\ntheir nomadic life in Asiatic steppes still persist among the Turks of\r\nEurope, after six centuries of sedentary life in the best agricultural\r\nland of the Balkan Peninsula. One of these appears in their choice of\r\nmeat. They eat chiefly sheep and goats, beef very rarely, and swine not\r\nat all.[29] The first two thrive on poor pastures and travel well, so\r\nthat they are admirably adapted to nomadic life in arid lands; the last\r\ntwo, far less so, but on the other hand are the regular concomitant of\r\nagricultural life. The Turk's taste to-day, therefore, is determined by\r\nthe flocks and herds which he once pastured on the Trans-Caspian plains.\r\nThe finished terrace agriculture and methods of irrigation, which the\r\nSaracens had learned on the mountain sides of Yemen through a schooling\r\nof a thousand years or more, facilitated their economic conquest of\r\nSpain. Their intelligent exploitation of the country's resources for the\r\nsupport of their growing numbers in the favorable climatic conditions\r\nwhich Spain offered was a light-hearted task, because of the severe\r\ntraining which they had had in their Arabian home.\r\n\r\nThe origin of Roman political institutions is intimately connected with\r\nconditions of the naturally small territory where arose the greatness of\r\nRome. But now, after two thousand years we see the political impress of\r\nthis narrow origin spreading to the governments of an area of Europe\r\nimmeasurably larger than the region that gave it birth. In the United\r\nStates, little New England has been the source of the strongest\r\ninfluences modifying the political, religious and cultural life of half\r\na continent; and as far as Texas and California these influences bear\r\nthe stamp of that narrow, unproductive environment which gave to its\r\nsons energy of character and ideals.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Transplanted religions.]\r\n\r\nIdeas especially are light baggage, and travel with migrant peoples\r\nover many a long and rough road. They are wafted like winged seed by the\r\nwind, and strike root in regions where they could never have originated.\r\nFew classes of ideas bear so plainly the geographic stamp of their\r\norigin as religious ones, yet none have spread more widely. The abstract\r\nmonotheism sprung from the bare grasslands of western Asia made slow but\r\nfinal headway against the exuberant forest gods of the early Germans.\r\nReligious ideas travel far from their seedbeds along established lines\r\nof communication. We have the almost amusing episode of the brawny\r\nBurgundians of the fifth century, who received the Arian form of\r\nChristianity by way of the Danube highway from the schools of Athens and\r\nAlexandria, valiantly supporting the niceties of Greek religious thought\r\nagainst the Roman version of the faith which came up the Rhone Valley.\r\n\r\nIf the sacred literature of Judaism and Christianity take weak hold upon\r\nthe western mind, this is largely because it is written in the symbolism\r\nof the pastoral nomad. Its figures of speech reflect life in deserts and\r\ngrasslands. For these figures the western mind has few or vague\r\ncorresponding ideas. It loses, therefore, half the import, for instance,\r\nof the Twenty-third Psalm, that picture of the nomad shepherd guiding\r\nhis flock across parched and trackless plains, to bring them at evening,\r\nweary, hungry, thirsty, to the fresh pastures and waving palms of some\r\noasis, whose green tints stand out in vivid contrast to the tawny wastes\r\nof the encompassing sands. \"He leadeth me beside the still waters,\" not\r\nthe noisy rushing stream of the rainy lands, but the quiet desert pool\r\nthat reflects the stars. What real significance has the tropical\r\nradiance of the lotus flower, the sacred symbol of Buddhism, for the\r\nMongolian lama in the cold and arid borders of Gobi or the wind-swept\r\nhighlands of sterile Tibet? And yet these exotic ideas live on, even if\r\nthey no longer bloom in the uncongenial soil. But to explain them in\r\nterms of their present environment would be indeed impossible.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Partial response to environment]\r\n\r\nA people may present at any given time only a partial response to their\r\nenvironment also for other reasons. This may be either because their\r\narrival has been too recent for the new habitat to make its influence\r\nfelt; or because, even after long residence, one overpowering\r\ngeographic factor has operated to the temporary exclusion of all others.\r\nUnder these circumstances, suddenly acquired geographic advantages of a\r\nhigh order or such advantages, long possessed but tardily made available\r\nby the release of national powers from more pressing tasks, may\r\ninstitute a new trend of historical development, resulting more from\r\nstimulating geographic conditions than from the natural capacities or\r\naptitudes of the people themselves. Such developments, though often\r\nbrilliant, are likely to be short-lived and to end suddenly or\r\ndisastrously, because not sustained by a deep-seated national impulse\r\nanimating the whole mass of the people. They cease when the first\r\nenthusiasm spends itself, or when outside competition is intensified, or\r\nthe material rewards decrease.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The case of Spain.]\r\n\r\nAn illustration is found in the mediæval history of Spain. The\r\nintercontinental location of the Iberian Peninsula exposed it to the\r\nSaracen conquest and to the constant reinforcements to Islam power\r\nfurnished by the Mohammedanized Berbers of North Africa. For seven\r\ncenturies this location was the dominant geographic factor in Spain's\r\nhistory. It made the expulsion of the Moors the sole object of all the\r\nIberian states, converted the country into an armed camp, made the\r\ngentleman adventurer and Christian knight the national ideal. It placed\r\nthe center of political control high up on the barren plateau of\r\nCastile, far from the centers of population and culture in the river\r\nlowlands or along the coast. It excluded the industrial and commercial\r\ndevelopment which was giving bone and sinew to the other European\r\nstates. The release of the national energies by the fall of Granada in\r\n1492 and the now ingrained spirit of adventure enabled Spain and\r\nPortugal to utilize the unparalleled advantage of their geographical\r\nposition at the junction of the Mediterranean and Atlantic highways, and\r\nby their great maritime explorations in the fifteenth and sixteenth\r\ncenturies, to become foremost among European colonial powers. But the\r\ndevelopment was sporadic, not supported by any widespread national\r\nmovement. In a few decades the maritime preëminence of the Iberian\r\nPeninsula began to yield to the competition of the Dutch and English,\r\nwho were, so to speak, saturated with their own maritime environment.\r\nThen followed the rapid decay of the sea power of Spain, followed by\r\nthat of Portugal, till by 1648 even her coasting trade was in the hands\r\nof the Dutch, and Dutch vessels were employed to maintain communication\r\nwith the West Indies.[30]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sporadic response to a new environment.]\r\n\r\nWe have a later instance of sporadic development under the stimulus of\r\nnew and favorable geographic conditions, a similar anti-climax. The\r\nexpansion of the Russians across the lowlands of Siberia was quite in\r\nharmony with the genius of that land-bred people; but when they reached\r\nBering Sea, the enclosed basin, the proximity of the American continent,\r\nthe island stepping-stones between, and the lure of rich sealskins to\r\nthe fur-hunting Cossacks determined a sudden maritime expansion, for\r\nwhich the Russian people were unfitted. Beginning in 1747, it swept the\r\ncoast of Alaska, located its American administrative center first on\r\nKadiak, then on Baranof Island, and by 1812 placed its southern outposts\r\non the California coast near San Francisco Bay and on the Farralone\r\nIslands.[31] Russian convicts were employed to man the crazy boats built\r\nof green lumber on the shores of Bering Sea, and Aleutian hunters with\r\ntheir _bidarkas_ were impressed to catch the seal.[32] The movement was\r\nproductive only of countless shipwrecks, many seal skins, and an\r\nopportunity to satisfy an old grudge against England. The territory\r\ngained was sold to the United States in 1867. This is the one instance\r\nin Russian history of any attempt at maritime expansion, and also of any\r\nwithdrawal from territory to which the Muscovite power had once\r\nestablished its claim. This fact alone would indicate that only\r\nexcessively tempting geographic conditions led the Russians into an\r\neconomic and political venture which neither the previously developed\r\naptitudes of the people nor the conditions of population and historical\r\ndevelopment on the Siberian seaboard were able to sustain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The larger conception of the environment.]\r\n\r\nThe history and culture of a people embody the effects of previous\r\nhabitats and of their final environment; but this means something more\r\nthan local geographic conditions. It involves influences emanating from\r\nfar beyond the borders. No country, no continent, no sea, mountain or\r\nriver is restricted to itself in the influence which it either exercises\r\nor receives. The history of Austria cannot be understood merely from\r\nAustrian ground. Austrian territory is part of the Mediterranean\r\nhinterland, and therefore has been linked historically with Rome, Italy,\r\nand the Adriatic. It is a part of the upper Danube Valley and therefore\r\nshares much of its history with Bavaria and Germany, while the lower\r\nDanube has linked it with the Black Sea, Greece, the Russian steppes,\r\nand Asia. The Asiatic Hungarians have pushed forward their ethnic\r\nboundary nearly to Vienna. The Austrian capital has seen the warring\r\nTurks beneath its walls, and shapes its foreign policy with a view to\r\nthe relative strength of the Sultan and the Czar.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Unity of the earth.]\r\n\r\nThe earth is an inseparable whole. Each country or sea is physically and\r\nhistorically intelligible only as a portion of that whole. Currents and\r\nwind-systems of the oceans modify the climate of the nearby continents,\r\nand direct the first daring navigations of their peoples. The\r\nalternating monsoons of the Indian Ocean guided Arab merchantmen from\r\nancient times back and forth between the Red Sea and the Malabar coast\r\nof India.[33] The Equatorial Current and the northeast trade-wind\r\ncarried the timid ships of Columbus across the Atlantic to America. The\r\nGulf Stream and the prevailing westerlies later gave English vessels the\r\nadvantage on the return voyage. Europe is a part of the Atlantic coast.\r\nThis is a fact so significant that the North Atlantic has become a\r\nEuropean sea. The United States also is a part of the Atlantic coast:\r\nthis is the dominant fact of American history. China forms a section of\r\nthe Pacific rim. This is the fact back of the geographic distribution of\r\nChinese emigration to Annam, Tonkin, Siam, Malacca, the Philippines,\r\nEast Indies, Borneo, Australia, Hawaiian Islands, the Pacific Coast\r\nStates, British Columbia, the Alaskan coast southward from Bristol Bay\r\nin Bering Sea, Ecuador and Peru.\r\n\r\nAs the earth is one, so is humanity. Its unity of species points to some\r\ndegree of communication through a long prehistoric past. Universal\r\nhistory is not entitled to the name unless it embraces all parts of the\r\nearth and all peoples, whether savage or civilized. To fill the gaps in\r\nthe written record it must turn to ethnology and geography, which by\r\ntracing the distribution and movements of primitive peoples can often\r\nreconstruct the most important features of their history.\r\n\r\nAnthropo-geographic problems are never simple. They must all be viewed\r\nin the long perspective of evolution and the historical past. They\r\nrequire allowance for the dominance of different geographic factors at\r\ndifferent periods, and for a possible range of geographic influences\r\nwide as the earth itself. In the investigator they call for pains-taking\r\nanalysis and, above all, an open mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n[1] George Adam Smith, Historical Geography of the Holy Land, pp.\r\n149-157.

Since the causal conception\r\nof geography demands a detailed analysis of all the relations between\r\nenvironment and human development, it is advisable to distinguish the\r\nvarious classes of geographic influences.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Physical effects.]\r\n\r\nFour fundamental classes of effects can be distinguished.\r\n\r\n1. The first class includes direct physical effects of environment,\r\nsimilar to those exerted on plants and animals by their habitat. Certain\r\ngeographic conditions, more conspicuously those of climate, apply\r\ncertain stimuli to which man, like the lower animals, responds by an\r\nadaption of his organism to his environment. Many physiological\r\npeculiarities of man are due to physical effects of environment, which\r\ndoubtless operated very strongly in the earliest stages of human\r\ndevelopment, and in those shadowy ages contributed to the\r\ndifferentiation of races. The unity of the human species is as clearly\r\nestablished as the diversity of races and peoples, whose divergences\r\nmust be interpreted chiefly as modifications in response to various\r\nhabitats in long periods of time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Variation and natural conditions.]\r\n\r\nSuch modifications have probably been numerous in the persistent and\r\nunending movements, shiftings, and migrations which have made up the\r\nlong prehistoric history of man. If the origin of species is found in\r\nvariability and inheritance, variation is undoubtedly influenced by a\r\nchange of natural conditions. To quote Darwin, \"In one sense the\r\nconditions of life may be said, not only to cause variability, either\r\ndirectly or indirectly, but likewise to include natural selection, for\r\nthe conditions determine whether this or that variety shall survive.\"[34]\r\nThe variability of man does not mean that every external influence\r\nleaves its mark upon him, but that man as an organism, by the\r\npreservation of beneficent variations and the elimination of deleterious\r\nones, is gradually adapted to his environment, so that he can utilize\r\nmost completely that which it contributes to his needs. This\r\nself-maintenance under outward influences is an essential part of the\r\nconception of life which Herbert Spencer defines as the correspondence\r\nbetween internal conditions and external circumstances, or August Comte\r\nas the harmony between the living being and the surrounding medium or\r\n_milieu_.\r\n\r\nAccording to Virchow, the distinction of races rests upon hereditary\r\nvariations, but heredity itself cannot become active till the\r\ncharacteristic or _Zustand_ is produced which is to be handed down.[35]\r\nBut environment determines what variation shall become stable enough to\r\nbe passed on by heredity. For instance, we can hardly err in attributing\r\nthe great lung capacity, massive chests, and abnormally large torsos of\r\nthe Quichua and Aymara Indians inhabiting the high Andean plateaus to\r\nthe rarified air found at an altitude of 10,000 or 15,000 feet above sea\r\nlevel. Whether these have been acquired by centuries of extreme lung\r\nexpansion, or represent the survival of a chance variation of undoubted\r\nadvantage, they are a product of the environment. They are a serious\r\nhandicap when the Aymara Indian descends to the plains, where he either\r\ndies off or leaves descendants with diminishing chests.[36] [See map page\r\n101.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stature and environment]\r\n\r\nDarwin holds that many slight changes in animals and plants, such as\r\nsize, color, thickness of skin and hair, have been produced through food\r\nsupply and climate from the external conditions under which the forms\r\nlived.[37] Paul Ehrenreich, while regarding the chief race distinctions\r\nas permanent forms, not to be explained by external conditions,\r\nnevertheless concedes the slight and slow variation of the sub-race\r\nunder changing conditions of food and climate as beyond doubt.[38]\r\nStature is partly a matter of feeding and hence of geographic condition.\r\nIn mountain regions, where the food resources are scant, the varieties\r\nof wild animals are characterized by smaller size in general than are\r\ncorresponding species in the lowlands. It is a noticeable fact that\r\ndwarfed horses or ponies have originated in islands, in Iceland, the\r\nShetlands, Corsica and Sardinia. This is due either to scanty and\r\nunvaried food or to excessive inbreeding, or probably to both. The\r\nhorses introduced into the Falkland Islands in 1764 have deteriorated so\r\nin size and strength in a few generations that they are in a fair way to\r\ndevelop a Falkland variety of pony.[39] On the other hand, Mr. Homer\r\nDavenport states that the pure-bred Arabian horses raised on his New\r\nJersey stock farm are in the third generation a hand higher than their\r\ngrandsires imported from Arabia, and of more angular build. The result\r\nis due to more abundant and nutritious food and the elimination of long\r\ndesert journeys.\r\n\r\nThe low stature of the natives prevailing in certain \"misery spots\" of\r\nEurope, as in the Auvergne Plateau of southern France, is due in part to\r\nrace, in part to a disastrous artificial selection by the emigration of\r\nthe taller and more robust individuals, but in considerable part to the\r\nharsh climate and starvation food-yield of that sterile soil; for the\r\nchildren of the region, if removed to the more fertile valleys of the\r\nLoire and Garonne, grow to average stature.[40] The effect of a scant and\r\nuncertain food supply is especially clear in savages, who have erected\r\nfewer buffers between themselves and the pressure of environment. The\r\nBushmen of the Kalahari Desert are shorter than their Hottentot kindred\r\nwho pasture their flocks and herds in the neighboring grasslands.[41]\r\nSamoyedes, Lapps, and other hyperborean races of Eurasia are shorter\r\nthan their more southern neighbors, the physical record of an immemorial\r\nstruggle against cold and hunger. The stunted forms and wretched aspect\r\nof the Snake Indians inhabiting the Rocky Mountain deserts distinguished\r\nthese clans from the tall buffalo-hunting tribes of the plains.[42] Any\r\nfeature of geographic environment tending to affect directly the\r\nphysical vigor and strength of a people cannot fail to prove a potent\r\nfactor in their history.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Physical effects of dominant activities.]\r\n\r\nOftentimes environment modifies the physique of a people indirectly by\r\nimposing upon them certain predominant activities, which may develop one\r\npart of the body almost to the point of deformity. This is the effect of\r\nincreased use or disuse which Darwin discusses. He attributes the thin\r\nlegs and thick arms of the Payaguas Indians living along the Paraguay\r\nRiver to generations of lives spent in canoes, with the lower\r\nextremities motionless and the arm and chest muscles in constant\r\nexercise.[43] Livingstone found these same characteristics of broad\r\nchests and shoulders with ill-developed legs among the Barotse of the\r\nupper Zambesi;[44] and they have been observed in pronounced form,\r\ncoupled with distinctly impaired powers of locomotion, among the\r\nTlingit, Tsimshean, and Haida Indians of the southern Alaskan and\r\nBritish Columbia coast, where the geographic conditions of a mountainous\r\nand almost strandless shore interdicted agriculture and necessitated\r\nsea-faring activities.[45] An identical environment has produced a like\r\nphysical effect upon the canoemen of Tierra del Fuego[46] and the\r\nAleutian Islanders, who often sit in their boats twenty hours at a\r\ntime.[47] These special adaptations are temporary in their nature and\r\ntend to disappear with change of occupation, as, for instance, among the\r\nTlingit Indians, who develop improved leg muscles when employed as\r\nlaborers in the salmon canneries of British Columbia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effects of climate.]\r\n\r\nBoth the direct and indirect physical effects of environment thus far\r\ninstanced are obvious in themselves and easily explained. Far different\r\nis it with the majority of physical effects, especially those of\r\nclimate, whose mode of operation is much more obscure than was once\r\nsupposed. The modern geographer does not indulge in the naive hypothesis\r\nof the last century, which assumed a prompt and direct effect of\r\nenvironment upon the form and features of man. Carl Ritter regarded the\r\nsmall, slit eyes and swollen lids of the Turkoman as \"an obvious effect\r\nof the desert upon the organism.\" Stanhope Smith ascribed the high\r\nshoulders and short neck of the Tartars of Mongolia to their habit of\r\nraising their shoulders to protect the neck against the cold; their\r\nsmall, squinting eyes, overhanging brows, broad faces and high cheek\r\nbones, to the effect of the bitter, driving winds and the glare of the\r\nsnow, till, he says, \"every feature by the action of the cold is harsh\r\nand distorted.\"[48] These profound influences of a severe climate upon\r\nphysiognomy he finds also among the Lapps, northern Mongolians,\r\nSamoyedes and Eskimo.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Acclimatization]\r\n\r\nMost of these problems are only secondarily grist for the geographer's\r\nmill. For instance, when the Aryans descended to the enervating lowlands\r\nof tropical India, and in that debilitating climate lost the qualities\r\nwhich first gave them supremacy, the change which they underwent was\r\nprimarily a physiological one. It can be scientifically described and\r\nexplained therefore only by physiologists and physico-chemists; and upon\r\ntheir investigations the geographer must wait before he approaches the\r\nproblem from the standpoint of geographical distribution. Into this\r\nsub-class of physical effects come all questions of acclimatization.[49]\r\nThese are important to the anthropo-geographer, just as they are to\r\ncolonial governments like England or France, because they affect the\r\npower of national or racial expansion, and fix the historical fate of\r\ntropical lands. The present populations of the earth represent physical\r\nadaptation to their environments. The intense heat and humidity of most\r\ntropical lands prevent any permanent occupation by a native-born\r\npopulation of pure whites. The catarrhal zone north of the fortieth\r\nparallel in America soon exterminates the negroes.[50]\r\n\r\nThe Indians of South America, though all fundamentally of the same\r\nethnic stock, are variously acclimated to the warm, damp, forested\r\nplains of the Amazon; to the hot, dry, treeless coasts of Peru; and to\r\nthe cold, arid heights of the Andes. The habitat that bred them tends to\r\nhold them, by restricting the range of climate which they can endure. In\r\nthe zone of the Andean slope lying between 4,000 and 6,000 feet of\r\naltitude, which produces the best flavored coffee and which must be\r\ncultivated, the imported Indians from the high plateaus and from the low\r\nAmazon plains alike sicken and die after a short time; so that they take\r\nemployment on these coffee plantations for only three or five months,\r\nand then return to their own homes. Labor becomes nomadic on these\r\nslopes, and in the intervals these farm lands of intensive agriculture\r\nshow the anomaly of a sparse population only of resident managers.[51]\r\nSimilarly in the high, dry Himalayan valley of the upper Indus, over\r\n10,000 feet above sea level, the natives of Ladak are restricted to a\r\nhabitat that yields them little margin of food for natural growth of\r\npopulation but forbids them to emigrate in search of more,--applies at\r\nthe same time the lash to drive and the leash to hold, for these\r\nhighlanders soon die when they reach the plains.[52] Here are two\r\nantagonistic geographic influences at work from the same environment,\r\none physical and the other social-economic. The Ladaki have reached an\r\ninteresting resolution of these two forces by the institution of\r\npolyandry, which keeps population practically stationary.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pigmentation and climate.]\r\n\r\nThe relation of pigmentation to climate has long interested geographers\r\nas a question of environment; but their speculations on the subject have\r\nbeen barren, because the preliminary investigations of the physiologist,\r\nphysicist and chemist are still incomplete. The general fact of\r\nincreasing nigrescence from temperate towards equatorial regions is\r\nconspicuous enough, despite some irregularity of the shading.[53] This\r\nfact points strongly to some direct relation between climate and\r\npigmentation, but gives no hint how the pigmental processes are\r\naffected. The physiologist finds that in the case of the negro, the dark\r\nskin is associated with a dense cuticle, diminished perspiration,\r\nsmaller chests and less respiratory power, a lower temperature and more\r\nrapid pulse,[54] all which variations may enter into the problem of the\r\nnegroes coloring. The question is therefore by no means simple.\r\n\r\nYet it is generally conceded by scientists that pigment is a protective\r\ndevice of nature. The negro's skin is comparatively insensitive to a sun\r\nheat that blisters a white man. Livingstone found the bodies of albino\r\nnegroes in Bechuana Land always blistered on exposure to the sun,[55]\r\nand a like effect has been observed among albino Polynesians, and\r\nMelanesians of Fiji.[56] Paul Ehrenreich finds that the degree of\r\ncoloration depends less upon annual temperature than upon the direct\r\neffect of the sun's rays; and that therefore a people dwelling in a\r\ncool, dry climate, but exposed to the sun may be darker than another in\r\na hot, moist climate but living in a dense forest. The forest-dwelling\r\nBotokudos of the upper San Francisco River in Brazil are fairer than the\r\nkindred Kayapo tribe, who inhabit the open campos; and the Arawak of the\r\nPurus River forests are lighter than their fellows in the central Matto\r\nGrosso.[57] Sea-faring coast folk, who are constantly exposed to the\r\nsun, especially in the Tropics, show a deeper pigmentation than their\r\nkindred of the wooded interior.[58] The coast Moros of western Mindanao\r\nare darker than the Subanos, their Malay brethren of the back country,\r\nthe lightness of whose color can be explained by their forest life.[59]\r\nSo the Duallas of the Kamerun coast of Africa are darker than the\r\nBakwiri inhabiting the forested mountains just behind them, though both\r\ntribes belong to the Bantu group of people.[60] Here light, in\r\ncontradistinction to heat, appears the dominant factor in pigmentation.\r\nA recent theory, advanced by von Schmaedel in 1895, rests upon the\r\nchemical power of light. It holds that the black pigment renders the\r\nnegro skin insensitive to the luminous or actinic effects of solar\r\nradiation, which are far more destructive to living protoplasm than the\r\nmerely calorific effects.[61]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pigmentation and altitude]\r\n\r\nColoration responds to other more obscure influences of environment. A\r\nclose connection between pigmentation and elevation above sea level has\r\nbeen established: a high altitude operates like a high latitude.\r\nBlondness increases appreciably on the higher slopes of the Black\r\nForest, Vosges Mountains, and Swiss Alps, though these isolated\r\nhighlands are the stronghold of the brunette Alpine race.[62] Livi, in\r\nhis treatise on military anthropometry, deduced a special action of\r\nmountains upon pigmentation on observing a prevailing increase of\r\nblondness in Italy above the four-hundred meter line, a phenomenon which\r\ncame out as strongly in Basilicata and Calabria provinces of the south\r\nas in Piedmont and Lombardy in the north.[63] The dark Hamitic Berbers\r\nof northern Africa have developed an unmistakable blond variant in high\r\nvalleys of the Atlas range, which in a sub-tropical region rises to the\r\nheight of 12,000 feet. Here among the Kabyles the population is fair;\r\ngrey, blue or green eyes are frequent, as is also reddish blond or\r\nchestnut hair.[64] Waitz long ago affirmed this tendency of mountaineers\r\nto lighter coloring from his study of primitive peoples.[65] The\r\nmodification can not be attributed wholly to climatic contrast between\r\nmountain and plain. Some other factor, like the economic poverty of the\r\nenvironment and the poor food-supply, as Livi suggests, has had a hand\r\nin the result; but just what it is or how it has operated cannot yet be\r\ndefined.[66]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Difficulty of Generalization]\r\n\r\nEnough has been said to show that the geographer can formulate no broad\r\ngeneralization as to the relation of pigmentation and climate from the\r\noccurrence of the darkest skins in the Tropics; because this fact is\r\nweakened by the appearance also of lighter tints in the hottest\r\ndistricts, and of darker ones in arctic and temperate regions. The\r\ngeographer must investigate the questions when and where deeper shades\r\ndevelop in the skins of fair races; what is the significance of dark\r\nskins in the cold zones and of fair ones in hot zones. His answer must\r\nbe based largely on the conclusions of physiologists and physicists, and\r\nonly when these have reached a satisfactory solution of each detail of\r\nthe problem can the geographer summarize the influence of environment\r\nupon pigmentation. The rule can therefore safely be laid down that in\r\nall investigation of geographic influences upon the permanent physical\r\ncharacteristics of races, the geographic distribution of these should be\r\nleft out of consideration till the last, since it so easily\r\nmisleads.[67] Moreover, owing to the ceaseless movements of mankind,\r\nthese effects do not remain confined to the region that produced them,\r\nbut pass on with the wandering throng in whom they have once developed,\r\nand in whom they endure or vanish according as they prove beneficial or\r\ndeleterious in the new habitat.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Psychical effects.]\r\n\r\nII. More varied and important are the psychical effects of geographic\r\nenvironment. As direct effects they are doubtless bound up in many\r\nphysiological modifications; and as influences of climate, they help\r\ndifferentiate peoples and races in point of temperament. They are\r\nreflected in man's religion and his literature, in his modes of thought\r\nand figures of speech. Blackstone states that \"in the Isle of Man, to\r\ntake away a horse or ox was no felony, but a trespass, because of the\r\ndifficulty in that little territory to conceal them or to carry them\r\noff; but to steal a pig or a fowl, which is easily done, was a capital\r\nmisdemeanour, and the offender punished with death.\" The judges or\r\ndeemsters in this island of fishermen swore to execute the laws as\r\nimpartially \"as the herring's backbone doth lie in the middle of the\r\nfish.\"[68] The whole mythology of the Polynesians is an echo of the\r\nencompassing ocean. The cosmography of every primitive people, their\r\nfirst crude effort in the science of the universe, bears the impress of\r\ntheir habitat. The Eskimo's hell is a place of darkness, storm and\r\nintense cold;[69] the Jew's is a place of eternal fire. Buddha, born in\r\nthe steaming Himalayan piedmont, fighting the lassitude induced by heat\r\nand humidity, pictured his heaven as Nirvana, the cessation of all\r\nactivity and individual life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Indirect effect upon language]\r\n\r\nIntellectual effects of environment may appear in the enrichment of a\r\nlanguage in one direction to a rare nicety of expression; but this may\r\nbe combined with a meager vocabulary in all other directions. The\r\ngreatest cattle-breeders among the native Africans, such as the Hereros\r\nof western Damaraland and the Dinkas of the upper White Nile, have an\r\namazing choice of words for all colors describing their animals--brown,\r\ndun, red, white, dapple, and so on in every gradation of shade and hue.\r\nThe Samoyedes of northern Russia have eleven or twelve terms to\r\ndesignate the various grays and browns of their reindeer, despite their\r\notherwise low cultural development.[70] The speech of nomads has an\r\nabundance of expressions for cattle in every relation of life. It\r\nincludes different words for breeding, pregnancy, death, and\r\nslaughtering in relation to every different kind of domestic animal. The\r\nMagyars, among whom pastoral life still survives on the low plains of\r\nthe Danube and Theiss, have a generic word for herd, _csorda_, and\r\nspecial terms for herds of cattle, horses, sheep, and swine.[71] While\r\nthe vocabulary of Malays and Polynesians is especially rich in nautical\r\nterms, the Kirghis shepherd tribes who wander over the highlands of\r\nwestern Asia from the Tian Shan to the Hindu Kush have four different\r\nterms for four kinds of mountain passes. A _daban_ is a difficult, rocky\r\ndefile; an _art_ is very high and dangerous; a _bel_ is a low, easy\r\npass, and a _kutal_ is a broad opening between low hills.[72]\r\n\r\nTo such influences man is a passive subject, especially in the earlier\r\nstages of his development; but there are more important influences\r\nemanating from his environment which affect him as an active agent,\r\nchallenge his will by furnishing the motives for its exercise, give\r\npurpose to his activities, and determine the direction which they shall\r\ntake.[73] These mold his mind and character through the media of his\r\neconomic and social life, and produce effects none the less important\r\nbecause they are secondary. About these anthropo-geography can reach\r\nsurer conclusions than regarding direct psychical effects, because it\r\ncan trace their mode of operation as well as define the result. Direct\r\npsychical effects are more matters of conjecture, whose causation is\r\nasserted rather than proved. They seem to float in the air, detached\r\nfrom the solid ground under foot, and are therefore subject matter for\r\nthe psychologist rather than the geographer.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The great man in history.]\r\n\r\nWhat of the great man in this geographical interpretation of history? It\r\nseems to take no account of him, or to put him into the melting-pot with\r\nthe masses. Both are to some extent true. As a science,\r\nanthropo-geography can deal only with large averages, and these exclude\r\nor minimize the exceptional individual. Moreover, geographic conditions\r\nwhich give this or that bent to a nation's purposes and determine its\r\naggregate activities have a similar effect upon the individual; but he\r\nmay institute a far-seeing policy, to whose wisdom only gradually is the\r\npeople awakened. The acts of the great man are rarely arbitrary or\r\nartificial; he accelerates or retards the normal course of development,\r\nbut cannot turn it counter to the channels of natural conditions. As a\r\nrule he is a product of the same forces that made his people. He moves\r\nwith them and is followed by them under a common impulse. Daniel Boone,\r\nthat picturesque figure leading the van of the westward movement over\r\nthe Allegheny Mountains, was born of his frontier environment and found\r\na multitude of his kind in that region of backwoods farms to follow him\r\ninto the wilderness. Thomas Jefferson of Virginia, in the Louisiana\r\nPurchase, carried out the policy of expansion adumbrated in Governor\r\nSpottswood's expedition with the Knights of the Golden Horseshoe over\r\nthe Blue Ridge in 1712. Jefferson's daring consummation of the purchase\r\nwithout government authority showed his community of purpose with the\r\nmajority of the people. Peter the Great's location of his capital at St.\r\nPetersburg, usually stigmatized as the act of a despot, was made in\r\nresponse to natural conditions offering access to the Baltic nations,\r\njust as certainly as ten centuries before similar conditions and\r\nidentical advantages led the early Russian merchants to build up a town\r\nat nearby Novgorod, in easy water connection with the Baltic\r\ncommerce.[74]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Economic and social effects.]\r\n\r\nIII. Geographic conditions influence the economic and social development\r\nof a people by the abundance, paucity, or general character of the\r\nnatural resources, by the local ease or difficulty of securing the\r\nnecessaries of life, and by the possibility of industry and commerce\r\nafforded by the environment. From the standpoint of production and\r\nexchange, these influences are primarily the subject matter of economic\r\nand commercial geography; but since they also permeate national life,\r\ndetermine or modify its social structure, condemn it to the dwarfing\r\neffects of national poverty, or open to it the cultural and political\r\npossibilities resident in national wealth, they are legitimate material\r\nalso for anthropo-geography.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Size of the social group.]\r\n\r\nThey are especially significant because they determine the size of the\r\nsocial group. This must be forever small in areas of limited resources\r\nor of limited extent, as in the little islands of the world and the yet\r\nsmaller oases. The desert of Chinese Turkestan supports, in certain\r\ndetached spots of river-born fertility, populations like the 60,000 of\r\nKashgar, and from this size groups all the way down to the single\r\nfamilies which Younghusband found living by a mere trickle of a stream\r\nflowing down the southern slope of the Tian Shan. Small islands,\r\naccording to their size, fertility, and command of trade, may harbor a\r\nsparse and scant population, like the five hundred souls struggling for\r\nan ill-fed existence on the barren Westman Isles of Iceland; or a\r\ncompact, teeming, yet absolutely small social group, like that crowding\r\nMalta or the Bermudas. Whether sparsely or compactly distributed, such\r\ngroups suffer the limitations inherent in their small size. They are\r\nforever excluded from the historical significance attaching to the\r\nlarge, continuously distributed populations of fertile continental\r\nlands.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effect upon movements of peoples.]\r\n\r\nIV. The next class belongs exclusively to the domain of geography,\r\nbecause it embraces the influence of the features of the earth's surface\r\nin directing the movements and ultimate distribution of mankind. It\r\nincludes the effect of natural barriers, like mountains, deserts,\r\nswamps, and seas, in obstructing or deflecting the course of migrating\r\npeople and in giving direction to national expansion; it considers the\r\ntendency of river valleys and treeless plains to facilitate such\r\nmovements, the power of rivers, lakes, bays and oceans either to block\r\nthe path or open a highway, according as navigation is in a primitive or\r\nadvanced stage; and finally the influence of all these natural features\r\nin determining the territory which a people is likely to occupy, and the\r\nboundaries which shall separate from their neighbors.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: River routes.]\r\n\r\nThe lines of expansion followed by the French and English in the\r\nsettlement of America and also the extent of territory covered by each\r\nwere powerfully influenced by geographic conditions. The early French\r\nexplorers entered the great east-west waterway of the St. Lawrence River\r\nand the Great Lakes, which carried them around the northern end of the\r\nAppalachian barrier into the heart of the continent, planted them on the\r\nlow, swampy, often navigable watershed of the Mississippi, and started\r\nthem on another river voyage of nearly two thousand miles to the Gulf of\r\nMexico. Here were the conditions and temptation for almost unlimited\r\nexpansion; hence French Canada reached to the head of Lake Superior, and\r\nFrench Louisiana to the sources of the Missouri, To the lot of the\r\nEnglish fell a series of short rivers with fertile valleys, nearly\r\nbarred at their not distant sources by a wall of forested mountains, but\r\nseparated from one another by low watersheds which facilitated lateral\r\nexpansion over a narrow belt between mountains and sea. Here a region of\r\nmild climate and fertile soil suited to agriculture, enclosed by strong\r\nnatural boundaries, made for compact settlement, in contrast to the wide\r\ndiffusion of the French. Later, when a growing population pressed\r\nagainst the western barrier, mountain gates opened at Cumberland Gap and\r\nthe Mohawk Valley; the Ohio River and the Great Lakes became interior\r\nthoroughfares, and the northwestern prairies lines of least resistance\r\nto the western settler. Rivers played the same part in directing and\r\nexpediting this forward movement, as did the Lena and the Amoor in the\r\nRussian advance into Siberia, the Humber and the Trent in the progress\r\nof the Angles into the heart of Britain, the Rhone and Danube in the\r\nmarch of the Romans into central Europe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Segregation and accessibility.]\r\n\r\nThe geographical environment of a people may be such as to segregate\r\nthem from others, and thereby to preserve or even intensify their\r\nnatural characteristics; or it may expose them to extraneous influences,\r\nto an infusion of new blood and new ideas, till their peculiarities are\r\ntoned down, their distinctive features of dialect or national dress or\r\nprovincial customs eliminated, and the people as a whole approach to the\r\ncomposite type of civilized humanity. A land shut off by mountains or\r\nsea from the rest of the world tends to develop a homogeneous people,\r\nsince it limits or prevents the intrusion of foreign elements; or when\r\nonce these are introduced, it encourages their rapid assimilation by the\r\nstrongly interactive life of a confined locality. Therefore large or\r\nremote islands are, as a rule, distinguished by the unity of their\r\ninhabitants in point of civilization and race characteristics. Witness\r\nGreat Britain, Ireland, Japan, Iceland, as also Australia and New\r\nZealand at the time of their discovery. The highlands of the Southern\r\nAppalachians, which form the \"mountain backyards\" of Kentucky, Tennessee\r\nand North Carolina, are peopled by the purest English stock in the\r\nUnited States, descendants of the backwoodsmen of the late eighteenth\r\ncentury. Difficulty of access and lack of arable land have combined to\r\ndiscourage immigration. In consequence, foreign elements, including the\r\nelsewhere ubiquitous negro, are wanting, except along the few railroads\r\nwhich in recent years have penetrated this country. Here survive an\r\neighteenth century English, Christmas celebrated on Twelfth Night, the\r\nspinning wheel, and a belief in Joshua's power to arrest the course of\r\nthe sun.[75]\r\n\r\nAn easily accessible land is geographically hospitable to all\r\nnew-comers, facilitates the mingling of peoples, the exchange of\r\ncommodities and ideas. The amalgamation of races in such regions depends\r\nupon the similarity or diversity of the ethnic elements and the duration\r\nof the common occupation. The broad, open valley of the Danube from the\r\nBlack Sea to Vienna contains a bizarre mixture of several stocks--Turks,\r\nBulgarians, various families of pure Slavs, Roumanians, Hungarians, and\r\nGermans. These elements are too diverse and their occupation of the\r\nvalley too recent for amalgamation to have advanced very far as yet. The\r\nmaritime plain and open river valleys of northern France show a complete\r\nfusion of the native Celts with the Saxons, Franks, and Normans who have\r\nsuccessively drifted into the region, just as the Teutonic and scanter\r\nSlav elements have blended in the Baltic plains from the Elbe to the\r\nVistula.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Change of habitat.]\r\n\r\nHere are four different classes of geographic influences, all which may\r\nbecome active in modifying a people when it changes its habitat. Many of\r\nthe characteristics acquired in the old home still live on, or at best\r\nyield slowly to the new environment. This is especially true of the\r\ndirect physical and psychical effects. But a country may work a prompt\r\nand radical change in the social organization of an immigrant people by\r\nthe totally new conditions of economic life which it presents. These may\r\nbe either greater wealth or poverty of natural resources than the race\r\nhas previously known, new stimulants or deterrents to commerce and\r\nintercourse, and new conditions of climate which affect the efficiency\r\nof the workman and the general character of production. From these a\r\nwhole complex mass of secondary effects may follow.\r\n\r\nThe Aryans and Mongols, leaving their homes in the cool barren highlands\r\nof Central Asia where nature dispensed her gifts with a miserly hand,\r\nand coming down to the hot, low, fertile plains of the Indian rivers,\r\nunderwent several fundamental changes in the process of adaptation to\r\ntheir new environment. An enervating climate did its work in slaking\r\ntheir energies; but more radical still was the change wrought by the\r\ncontrast of poverty and abundance, enforced asceticism and luxury,\r\npresented by the old and new home. The restless, tireless shepherds\r\nbecame a sedentary, agricultural people; the abstemious nomads,--spare,\r\nsinewy, strangers to indulgence--became a race of rulers, revelling in\r\nluxury, lording it over countless subjects; finally, their numbers\r\nincreased rapidly, no longer kept down by the scant subsistence of arid\r\ngrasslands and scattered oases.\r\n\r\nIn a similar way, the Arab of the desert became transformed into the\r\nsedentary lord of Spain. In the luxuriance of field and orchard which\r\nhis skilful methods of irrigation and tillage produced, in the growing\r\npredominance of the intellectual over the nomadic military life, of the\r\ncomplex affairs of city and mart over the simple tasks of herdsman or\r\ncultivator, he lost the benefit of the early harsh training and\r\ntherewith his hold upon his Iberian empire. Biblical history gives us\r\nthe picture of the Sheik Abraham, accompanied by his nephew Lot, moving\r\nup from the rainless plains of Mesopotamia with his flocks and herds\r\ninto the better watered Palestine. There his descendants in the garden\r\nland of Canaan became an agricultural people; and the problem of Moses\r\nand the Judges was to prevent their assimilation in religion and custom\r\nto the settled Semitic tribes about them, and to make them preserve the\r\nideals born in the starry solitudes of the desert.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Retrogression in new habitat.]\r\n\r\nThe change from the nomadic to the sedentary life represents an economic\r\nadvance. Sometimes removal to strongly contrasted geographic conditions\r\nnecessitates a reversion to a lower economic type of existence. The\r\nFrench colonists who came to Lower Canada in the seventeenth and\r\neighteenth centuries found themselves located in a region of intense\r\ncold, where arable soil was inferior in quality and limited in amount,\r\nproducing no staple like the tobacco of Virginia or the wheat of\r\nMaryland or the cotton of South Carolina or the sugar of the West\r\nIndies, by which a young colony might secure a place in European trade.\r\nBut the snow-wrapped forests of Canada yielded an abundance of\r\nfur-bearing animals, the fineness and thickness of whose pelts were born\r\nof this frozen north. Into their remotest haunts at the head of Lake\r\nSuperior or of Hudson Bay, long lines of rivers and lakes opened level\r\nwater roads a thousand miles or more from the crude little colonial\r\ncapital at Quebec. And over in Europe beaver hats and fur-trimmed\r\ngarments were all the style! So the plodding farmer from Normandy and\r\nthe fisherman from Poitou, transferred to Canadian soil, were\r\nirresistibly drawn into the adventurous life of the trapper and\r\nfur-trader. The fur trade became the accepted basis of colonial life;\r\nthe _voyageur_ and _courier de bois_, clad in skins, paddling up\r\nice-rimmed streams in their birch-bark canoes, fraternizing with Indians\r\nwho were their only companions in that bleak interior, and married often\r\nto dusky squaws, became assimilated to the savage life about them and\r\nreverted to the lower hunter stage of civilization.[76]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Boers of South Africa]\r\n\r\nAnother pronounced instance of rapid retrogression under new unfavorable\r\ngeographic conditions is afforded by the South African Boer. The\r\ntransfer from the busy commercial cities of the Rhine mouths to the\r\nfar-away periphery of the world's trade, from the intensive agriculture\r\nof small deltaic gardens and the scientific dairy farming of the moist\r\nNetherlands to the semi-arid pastures of the high, treeless _veldt_,\r\nwhere they were barred from contact with the vivifying sea and its\r\nship-borne commerce, has changed the enterprising seventeenth century\r\nHollander into the conservative pastoral Boer. Dutch cleanliness has\r\nnecessarily become a tradition to a people who can scarcely find water\r\nfor their cattle. The comfort and solid bourgeois elegance of the Dutch\r\nhome lost its material equipment in the Great Trek, when the long wagon\r\njourney reduced household furniture to its lowest terms. House-wifely\r\nhabits and order vanished in the semi-nomadic life which followed.[77]\r\nThe gregarious instinct, bred by the closely-packed population of little\r\nHolland, was transformed to a love of solitude, which in all lands\r\ncharacterizes the people of a remote and sparsely inhabited frontier. It\r\nis a common saying that the Boer cannot bear to see another man's smoke\r\nfrom his _stoep_, just as the early Trans-Allegheny pioneer was always\r\non the move westward, because he could not bear to hear his neighbor's\r\nwatch-dog bark. Even the Boer language has deteriorated under the\r\neffects of isolation and a lower status of civilization. The native\r\n_Taal_ differs widely from the polished speech of Holland; it preserves\r\nsome features of the High Dutch of two centuries ago, but has lost\r\ninflexions and borrowed words for new phenomena from the English,\r\nKaffirs and Hottentots; can express no abstract ideas, only the concrete\r\nideas of a dull, work-a-day world.[78]\r\n\r\nThe new habitat may eliminate many previously acquired characteristics\r\nand hence transform a people, as in the case of the Boers; or it may\r\nintensify tribal or national traits, as in the seafaring propensities of\r\nthe Angles and Saxons when transferred to Britain, and of the\r\nseventeenth century English when transplanted to the indented coasts of\r\nNew England; or it may tolerate mere survival or the slow dissuetude of\r\nqualities which escape any particular pressure in the new environment,\r\nand which neither benefit nor handicap in the modified struggle for\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n[34] Darwin, Origin of Species, Chap.

History, sociology,\r\nethnology touch only the inhabited areas of the earth. These areas gain\r\ntheir final significance because of the people who occupy them; their\r\nlocal conditions of climate, soil, natural resources, physical features\r\nand geographic situation are important primarily as factors in the\r\ndevelopment of actual or possible inhabitants. A land is fully\r\ncomprehended only when studied in the light of its influence upon its\r\npeople, and a people cannot be understood apart from the field of its\r\nactivities. More than this, human activities are fully intelligible only\r\nin relation to the various geographic conditions which have stimulated\r\nthem in different parts of the world. The principles of the evolution of\r\nnavigation, of agriculture, of trade, as also the theory of population,\r\ncan never reach their correct and final statement, unless the data for\r\nthe conclusions are drawn from every part of the world, and each fact\r\ninterpreted in the light of the local conditions whence it sprang.\r\nTherefore anthropology, sociology and history should be permeated by\r\ngeography.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Political geography and history.]\r\n\r\nIn history, the question of territory,--by which is meant mere area in\r\ncontrast to specific geographic conditions--has constantly come to the\r\nfront, because a state obviously involved land and boundaries, and\r\nassumed as its chief function the defence and extension of these.\r\nTherefore political geography developed early as an offshoot of history.\r\nPolitical science has often formulated its principles without regard to\r\nthe geographic conditions of states, but as a matter of fact, the most\r\nfruitful political policies of nations have almost invariably had a\r\ngeographic core. Witness the colonial policy of Holland, England, France\r\nand Portugal, the free-trade policy of England, the militantism of\r\nGermany, the whole complex question of European balance of power and the\r\nBosporus, and the Monroe Doctrine of the United States. Dividing lines\r\nbetween political parties tend to follow approximately geographic lines\r\nof cleavage; and these make themselves apparent at recurring intervals\r\nof national upheaval, perhaps with, centuries between, like a submarine\r\nvolcanic rift. In England the southeastern plain and the northwestern\r\nuplands have been repeatedly arrayed against each other, from the Roman\r\nconquest which embraced the lowlands up to about the 500-foot contour\r\nline,[79] through the War of the Roses and the Civil War,[80] to the\r\nstruggle for the repeal of the Corn Laws and the great Reform Bill of\r\n1832.[81] Though the boundary lines have been only roughly the same and\r\neach district has contained opponents of the dominant local party,\r\nnevertheless the geographic core has been plain enough.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Political versus social geography.]\r\n\r\nThe land is a more conspicuous factor in the history of states than in\r\nthe history of society, but not more necessary and potent. Wars, which\r\nconstitute so large a part of political history, have usually aimed more\r\nor less directly at acquisition or retention of territory; they have\r\nmade every petty quarrel the pretext for mulcting the weaker nation of\r\npart of its land. Political maps are therefore subject to sudden and\r\nradical alterations, as when France's name was wiped off the North\r\nAmerican continent in 1763, or when recently Spain's sovereignty in the\r\nWestern Hemisphere was obliterated. But the race stocks, languages,\r\ncustoms, and institutions of both France and Spain remained after the\r\nflags had departed. The reason is that society is far more deeply rooted\r\nin the land than is a state, does not expand or contract its area so\r\nreadily. Society is always, in a sense, _adscripta glebae_; an expanding\r\nstate which incorporates a new piece of territory inevitably\r\nincorporates its inhabitants, unless it exterminates or expels them. Yet\r\nbecause racial and social geography changes slowly, quietly and\r\nimperceptibly, like all those fundamental processes which we call\r\ngrowth, it is not so easy and obvious a task to formulate a natural law\r\nfor the territorial relations of the various hunter, pastoral nomadic,\r\nagricultural, and industrial types of society as for those of the\r\ngrowing state.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Land basis of society.]\r\n\r\nMost systems of sociology treat man as if he were in some way detached\r\nfrom the earth's surface; they ignore the land basis of society. The\r\nanthropo-geographer recognizes the various social forces, economic and\r\npsychologic, which sociologists regard as the cement of societies; but\r\nhe has something to add. He sees in the land occupied by a primitive\r\ntribe or a highly organized state the underlying material bond holding\r\nsociety together, the ultimate basis of their fundamental social\r\nactivities, which are therefore derivatives from the land. He sees the\r\ncommon territory exercising an integrating force,--weak in primitive\r\ncommunities where the group has established only a few slight and\r\ntemporary relations with its soil, so that this low social complex\r\nbreaks up readily like its organic counterpart, the low animal organism\r\nfound in an amoeba; he sees it growing stronger with every advance in\r\ncivilization involving more complex relations to the land,--with settled\r\nhabitations, with increased density of population, with a discriminating\r\nand highly differentiated use of the soil, with the exploitation of\r\nmineral resources, and finally with that far-reaching exchange of\r\ncommodities and ideas which means the establishment of varied\r\nextra-territorial relations. Finally, the modern society or state has\r\ngrown into every foot of its own soil, exploited its every geographic\r\nadvantage, utilized its geographic location to enrich itself by\r\ninternational trade, and when possible, to absorb outlying territories\r\nby means of colonies. The broader this geographic base, the richer, more\r\nvaried its resources, and the more favorable its climate to their\r\nexploitation, the more numerous and complex are the connections which\r\nthe members of a social group can establish with it, and through it with\r\neach other; or in other words, the greater may be its ultimate\r\nhistorical significance. The polar regions and the subtropical deserts,\r\non the other hand, permit man to form only few and intermittent\r\nrelations with any one spot, restrict economic methods to the lower\r\nstages of development, produce only the small, weak, loosely organized\r\nhorde, which never evolves into a state so long as it remains in that\r\nretarding environment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Morgan's Societas.]\r\n\r\nMan in his larger activities, as opposed to his mere physiological or\r\npsychological processes, cannot be studied apart from the land which he\r\ninhabits. Whether we consider him singly or in a group--family, clan,\r\ntribe or state--we must always consider him or his group in relation to\r\na piece of land. The ancient Irish sept, Highland clan, Russian mir,\r\nCherokee hill-town, Bedouin tribe, and the ancient Helvetian canton,\r\nlike the political state of history, have meant always a group of people\r\nand a bit of land. The first presupposes the second. In all cases the\r\nform and size of the social group, the nature of its activities, the\r\ntrend and limit of its development will be strongly influenced by the\r\nsize and nature of its habitat. The land basis is always present, in\r\nspite of Morgan's artificial distinction between a theoretically\r\nlandless _societas_, held together only by the bond of common blood, and\r\nthe political _civitas_ based upon land.[82] Though primitive society\r\nfound its conscious bond in common blood, nevertheless the land bond was\r\nalways there, and it gradually asserted its fundamental character with\r\nthe evolution of society.\r\n\r\nThe savage and barbarous groups which in Morgan's classification would\r\nfall under the head of _societas_ have nevertheless a clear conception\r\nof their ownership of the tribal lands which they use in common. This\r\nidea is probably of very primitive origin, arising from the association\r\nof a group with its habitat, whose food supply they regard as a\r\nmonopoly.[83] This is true even of migratory hunting tribes. They claim a\r\ncertain area whose boundaries, however, are often ill-defined and\r\nsubject to fluctuations, because the lands are not held by permanent\r\noccupancy and cultivation. An exceptional case is that of the Shoshone\r\nIndians, inhabiting the barren Utah basin and the upper valleys of the\r\nSnake and Salmon Rivers, who are accredited with no sense of ownership\r\nof the soil. In their natural state they roved about in small, totally\r\nunorganized bands or single families, and changed their locations so\r\nwidely, that they seemed to lay no claim to any particular portion. The\r\nhopeless sterility of the region and its poverty of game kept its\r\ndestitute inhabitants constantly on the move to gather in the meager\r\nfood supply, and often restricted the social group to the family.[84]\r\nHere the bond between land and tribe, and hence between the members of\r\nthe tribe, was the weakest possible.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Land bond in hunter tribes.]\r\n\r\nThe usual type of tribal ownership was presented by the Comanches,\r\nnomadic horse Indians who occupied the grassy plains of northern Texas.\r\nThey held their territory and the game upon it as the common property of\r\nthe tribe, and jealously guarded the integrity of their domain.[85] The\r\nchief Algonquin tribes, who occupied the territory between the Ohio\r\nRiver and the Great Lakes, had each its separate domain, within which it\r\nshifted its villages every few years; but its size depended upon the\r\npower of the tribe to repel encroachment upon its hunting grounds.\r\nRelying mainly on the chase and fishing, little on agriculture, for\r\ntheir subsistence, their relations to their soil were superficial and\r\ntransitory, their tribal organization in a high degree unstable.[86]\r\nStudents of American ethnology generally agree that most of the Indian\r\ntribes east of the Mississippi were occupying definite areas at the time\r\nof the discovery, and were to a considerable extent sedentary and\r\nagricultural. Though nomadic within the tribal territory, as they moved\r\nwith the season in pursuit of game, they returned to their villages,\r\nwhich were shifted only at relatively long intervals.[87]\r\n\r\nThe political organization of the native Australians, low as they were\r\nin the social scale, seems to have been based chiefly on the claim of\r\neach wretched wandering tribe to a definite territory.[88] In north\r\ncentral Australia, where even a very sparse population has sufficed to\r\nsaturate the sterile soil, tribal boundaries have become fixed and\r\ninviolable, so that even war brings no transfer of territory. Land and\r\npeople are identified. The bond is cemented by their primitive religion,\r\nfor the tribe's spirit ancestors occupied this special territory.[89] In\r\na like manner a very definite conception of tribal ownership of land\r\nprevails among the Bushmen and Bechuanas of South Africa; and to the\r\npastoral Hereros the alienation of their land is inconceivable.[90] [See\r\nmap page 105.]\r\n\r\nA tribe of hunters can never be more than a small horde, because the\r\nsimple, monotonous savage economy permits no concentration of\r\npopulation, no division of labor except that between the sexes, and\r\nhence no evolution of classes. The common economic level of all is\r\nreflected in the simple social organization,[91] which necessarily has\r\nlittle cohesion, because the group must be prepared to break up and\r\nscatter in smaller divisions, when its members increase or its savage\r\nsupplies decrease even a little. Such primitive groups cannot grow into\r\nlarger units, because these would demand more roots sent down into the\r\nsustaining soil; but they multiply by fission, like the infusorial\r\nmonads, and thereafter lead independent existences remote from each\r\nother. This is the explanation of multiplication of dialects among\r\nsavage tribes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Land bond in fisher tribes.]\r\n\r\nFishing tribes have their chief occupation determined by their habitats,\r\nwhich are found along well stocked rivers, lakes, or coastal fishing\r\ngrounds. Conditions here encourage an early adoption of sedentary life,\r\ndiscourage wandering except for short periods, and facilitate the\r\nintroduction of agriculture wherever conditions of climate and soil\r\npermit. Hence these fisher folk develop relatively large and permanent\r\nsocial groups, as testified by the ancient lake-villages of Switzerland,\r\nbased upon a concentrated food-supply resulting from a systematic and\r\noften varied exploitation of the local resources. The coöperation and\r\nsubmission to a leader necessary in pelagic fishing often gives the\r\npreliminary training for higher political organization.[92] All the\r\nprimitive stocks of the Brazilian Indians, except the mountain Ges, are\r\nfishermen and agriculturists; hence their annual migrations are kept\r\nwithin narrow limits. Each linguistic group occupies a fixed and\r\nrelatively well defined district.[93] Stanley found along the Congo\r\nlarge permanent villages of the natives, who were engaged in fishing and\r\ntilling the fruitful soil, but knew little about the country ten miles\r\nback from the river. These two generous means of subsistence are\r\neverywhere combined in Polynesia, Micronesia and Melanesia: there they\r\nare associated with dense populations and often with advanced political\r\norganization, as we find it in the feudal monarchy of Tonga and the\r\nsavage Fiji Islands.[94] Fisher tribes, therefore, get an early impulse\r\nforward in civilization;[95] and even where conditions do not permit the\r\nupward step to agriculture, these tribes have permanent relations with\r\ntheir land, form stable social groups, and often utilize their location\r\non a natural highway to develop systematic trade. For instance, on the\r\nnorthwest coast of British Columbia and Southern Alaska, the Haida,\r\nTlingit and Tsimshean Indians have portioned out all the land about\r\ntheir seaboard villages among the separate families or households as\r\nhunting, fishing, and berrying grounds. These are regarded as private\r\nproperty and are handed down from generation to generation. If they are\r\nused by anyone other than the owner, the privilege must be paid for.\r\nEvery salmon stream has its proprietor, whose summer camp can be seen\r\nset up at the point where the run of the fish is greatest. Combined with\r\nthis private property in land there is a brisk trade up and down the\r\ncoast, and a tendency toward feudalism in the village communities, owing\r\nto the association of power and social distinction with wealth and\r\nproperty in land.[96]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Land bond in pastoral societies.]\r\n\r\nAmong pastoral nomads, among whom a systematic use of their territory\r\nbegins to appear, and therefore a more definite relation between land\r\nand people, we find a more distinct notion than among wandering hunters\r\nof territorial ownership, the right of communal use, and the distinct\r\nobligation of common defense. Hence the social bond is drawn closer. The\r\nnomad identifies himself with a certain district, which belongs to his\r\ntribe by tradition or conquest, and has its clearly defined boundaries.\r\nHere he roams between its summer and winter pastures, possibly one\r\nhundred and fifty miles apart, visits its small arable patches in the\r\nspring for his limited agricultural ventures, and returns to them in the\r\nfall to reap their meager harvest. Its springs, streams, or wells assume\r\nenhanced value, are things to be fought for, owing to the prevailing\r\naridity of summer; while ownership of a certain tract of desert or\r\ngrassland carries with it a certain right in the bordering settled\r\ndistrict as an area of plunder.[97]\r\n\r\nThe Kara-Kirghis stock, who have been located since the sixteenth\r\ncentury on Lake Issik-Kul, long ago portioned out the land among the\r\nseparate families, and determined their limits by natural features of\r\nthe landscape.[98] Sven Hedin found on the Tarim River poles set up to\r\nmark the boundary between the Shah-yar and Kuchar tribal pastures.[99]\r\nJohn de Plano Carpini, traveling over southern Russia in 1246,\r\nimmediately after the Tartar conquest, found that the Dnieper, Don,\r\nVolga and Ural rivers were all boundaries between domains of the various\r\nmillionaries or thousands, into which the Tartar horde was\r\norganized.[100] The population of this vast country was distributed\r\naccording to the different degrees of fertility and the size of the\r\npastoral groups.[101] Volney observed the same distinction in the\r\ndistribution of the Bedouins of Syria. He found the barren cantons held\r\nby small, widely scattered tribes, as in the Desert of Suez; but the\r\ncultivable cantons, like the Hauran and the Pachalic of Aleppo, closely\r\ndotted by the encampments of the pastoral owners.[102]\r\n\r\nThe large range of territory held by a nomadic tribe is all successively\r\noccupied in the course of a year, but each part only for a short period\r\nof time. A pastoral use of even a good district necessitates a move of\r\nfive or ten miles every few weeks. The whole, large as it may be, is\r\nabsolutely necessary for the annual support of the tribe. Hence any\r\noutside encroachment upon their territory calls for the united\r\nresistance of the tribe. This joint or social action is dictated by\r\ntheir common interest in pastures and herds. The social administration\r\nembodied in the apportionment of pastures among the families or clans\r\ngrows out of the systematic use of their territory, which represents a\r\ncloser relation between land and people than is found among purely\r\nhunting tribes. Overcrowding by men or livestock, on the other hand,\r\nputs a strain upon the social bond. When Abraham and Lot, typical\r\nnomads, returned from Egypt to Canaan with their large flocks and herds,\r\nrivalry for the pastures occasioned conflicts among their shepherds, so\r\nthe two sheiks decided to separate. Abraham took the hill pastures of\r\nJudea, and Lot the plains of Jordan near the settled district of\r\nSodom.[103]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Geographical mark of low-type societies.]\r\n\r\nThe larger the amount of territory necessary for the support of a given\r\nnumber of people, whether the proportion be due to permanent poverty of\r\nnatural resources as in the Eskimo country, or to retarded economic\r\ndevelopment as among the Indians of primitive America or the present\r\nSudanese, the looser is the connection between land and people, and the\r\nlower the type of social organization. For such groups the organic\r\ntheory of society finds an apt description. To quote Spencer, \"The\r\noriginal clusters, animal and social, are not only small, but they lack\r\ndensity. Creatures of low type occupy large spaces considering the small\r\nquantity of animal substance they contain; and low-type societies spread\r\nover areas that are wide relatively to the number of their component\r\nindividuals.\"[104] In common language this means small tribes or even\r\ndetached families sparsely scattered over wide areas, living in\r\ntemporary huts or encampments of tepees and tents shifted from place to\r\nplace, making no effort to modify the surface of the land beyond\r\nscratching the soil to raise a niggardly crop of grain or tubers, and no\r\ninvestment of labor that might attach to one spot the sparse and migrant\r\npopulation. [See density maps pages 8 and 9.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Land and state.]\r\n\r\nThe superiority over this social type of the civilized state lies in the\r\nhighly organized utilization of its whole geographic basis by the mature\r\ncommunity, and in the development of government that has followed the\r\nincreasing density of population and multiplication of activities\r\ngrowing out of this manifold use of the land. Sedentary agriculture,\r\nwhich forms its initial economic basis, is followed by industrialism and\r\ncommerce. The migratory life presents only limited accumulation of\r\ncapital, and restricts narrowly its forms. Permanent settlement\r\nencourages accumulation in every form, and under growing pressure of\r\npopulation slowly reveals the possibilities of every foot of ground, of\r\nevery geographic advantage. These are the fibers of the land which\r\nbecome woven into the whole fabric of the nation's life. These are the\r\ngeographic elements constituting the soil in which empires are rooted;\r\nthey rise in the sap of the nation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Strength of the land bond in the state.]\r\n\r\nThe geographic basis of a state embodies a whole complex of physical\r\nconditions which may influence its historical development. The most\r\npotent of these are its size and zonal location; its situation, whether\r\ncontinental or insular, inland or maritime, on the open ocean or an\r\nenclosed sea; its boundaries, whether drawn by sea, mountain, desert or\r\nthe faint demarking line of a river; its forested mountains, grassy\r\nplains, and arable lowlands; its climate and drainage system; finally\r\nits equipment with plant and animal life, whether indigenous or\r\nimported, and its mineral resources. When a state has taken advantage\r\nof all its natural conditions, the land becomes a constituent part of\r\nthe state,[105] modifying the people which inhabit it, modified by them\r\nin turn, till the connection between the two becomes so strong by\r\nreciprocal interaction, that the people cannot be understood apart from\r\ntheir land. Any attempt to divide them theoretically reduces the social\r\nor political body to a cadaver, valuable for the study of structural\r\nanatomy after the method of Herbert Spencer, but throwing little light\r\nupon the vital processes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Weak land tenure of hunting and pastoral tribes.]\r\n\r\nA people who makes only a transitory or superficial use of its land has\r\nupon it no permanent or secure hold. The power to hold is measured by\r\nthe power to use; hence the weak tenure of hunting and pastoral tribes.\r\nBetween their scattered encampments at any given time are wide\r\ninterstices, inviting occupation by any settlers who know how to make\r\nbetter use of the soil. This explains the easy intrusion of the English\r\ncolonists into the sparsely tenanted territory of the Indians, of the\r\nagricultural Chinese into the pasture lands of the Mongols beyond the\r\nGreat Wall, of the American pioneers into the hunting grounds of the\r\nHudson Bay Company in the disputed Oregon country.[106] The frail bonds\r\nwhich unite these lower societies to their soil are easily ruptured and\r\nthe people themselves dislodged, while their land is appropriated by the\r\nintruder. But who could ever conceive of dislodging the Chinese or the\r\nclose-packed millions of India? A modern state with a given population\r\non a wide area is more vulnerable than another of like population more\r\nclosely distributed; but the former has the advantage of a reserve\r\nterritory for future growth.[107] This was the case of Kursachsen and\r\nBrandenburg in the sixteenth century, and of the United States\r\nthroughout its history. But beside the danger of inherent weakness\r\nbefore attack, a condition of relative underpopulation always threatens\r\na retardation of development. Easy-going man needs the prod of a\r\npressing population. [Compare maps pages 8 and 103 for examples.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Land and food supply.]\r\n\r\nFood is the urgent and recurrent need of individuals and of society. It\r\ndictates their activities in relation to their land at every stage of\r\neconomic development, fixes the locality of the encampment or village,\r\nand determines the size of the territory from which sustenance is\r\ndrawn. The length of residence in one place depends upon whether the\r\nsprings of its food supply are perennial or intermittent, while the\r\nabundance of their flow determines how large a population a given piece\r\nof land can support.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Advance from natural to artificial basis of subsistence.]\r\n\r\nHunter and fisher folk, relying almost exclusively upon what their land\r\nproduces of itself, need a large area and derive from it only an\r\nirregular food supply, which in winter diminishes to the verge of\r\nfamine. The transition to the pastoral stage has meant the substitution\r\nof an artificial for a natural basis of subsistence, and therewith a\r\nchange which more than any other one thing has inaugurated the advance\r\nfrom savagery to civilization.[108] From the standpoint of economics, the\r\nforward stride has consisted in the application of capital in the form\r\nof flocks and herds to the task of feeding the wandering horde;[109] from\r\nthe standpoint of alimentation, in the guarantee of a more reliable and\r\ngenerally more nutritious food supply, which enables population to grow\r\nmore steadily and rapidly; from the standpoint of geography, in the\r\nmarked reduction in the per capita amount of land necessary to yield an\r\nadequate and stable food supply. Pastoral nomadism can support in a\r\ngiven district of average quality from ten to twenty times as many souls\r\nas can the chase; but in this respect is surpassed from twenty to\r\nthirty-fold by the more productive agriculture. While the subsistence of\r\na nomad requires 100 to 200 acres of land, for that of a skillful farmer\r\nfrom 1 to 2 acres suffice.[110] In contrast, the land of the Indians\r\nliving in the Hudson Bay Territory in 1857 averaged 10 square miles per\r\ncapita; that of the Indians in the United States in 1825, subsidized\r\nmoreover by the government, 1-1/4 square miles.[111]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Land in relation to agriculture.]\r\n\r\nWith transition to the sedentary life of agriculture, society makes a\r\nfurther gain over nomadism in the closer integration of its social\r\nunits, due to permanent residence in larger and more complex groups; in\r\nthe continuous release of labor from the task of mere food-getting for\r\nhigher activities, resulting especially in the rapid evolution of the\r\nhome; and finally in the more elaborate organization in the use of the\r\nland, leading to economic differentiation of different localities and\r\nto a rapid increase in the population supported by a given area, so that\r\nthe land becomes the dominant cohesive force in society. [See maps pages\r\n8 and 9.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Migratory agriculture]\r\n\r\nAgriculture is adopted at first on a small scale as an adjunct to the\r\nchase or herding. It tends therefore to partake of the same extensive\r\nand nomadic character[112] as these other methods of gaining subsistence,\r\nand only gradually becomes sedentary and intensive. Such was the\r\nsuperficial, migratory tillage of most American Indians, shifting with\r\nthe village in the wake of the retreating game or in search of fresh\r\nunexhausted soil. Such is the agriculture of the primitive Korkus in the\r\nMahadeo Hills in Central India. They clear a forested slope by burning;\r\nrake over the ashes in which they sow their grain, and reap a fairly\r\ngood crop in the fertilized soil. The second year the clearing yields a\r\nreduced product and the third year is abandoned. When the hamlet of five\r\nor six families has exhausted all the land about it, it moves to a new\r\nspot to repeat the process.[113]\r\n\r\nThe same superficial, extensive tillage, with abandonment of fields\r\nevery few years, prevails in the Tartar districts of the Russian\r\nsteppes, as it did among the cattle-raising Germans at the beginning of\r\ntheir history. Tacitus says of them, _Arva per annos mutant et superest\r\nager_,[114] commenting at the same time upon their abundance of land and\r\ntheir reluctance to till. Where nomadism is made imperative by aridity,\r\nthe agriculture which accompanies it tends to become fixed, owing to the\r\nfew localities blessed with an irrigating stream to moisten the soil.\r\nThese spots, generally selected for the winter residence, have their\r\nsoil enriched, moreover, by the long stay of the herd and thus avoid\r\nexhaustion.[115] Often, however, in enclosed basins the salinity of the\r\nirrigating streams in their lower course ruins the fields after one or\r\ntwo crops, and necessitates a constant shifting of the cultivated\r\npatches; hence agriculture remains subsidiary to the yield of the\r\npastures. This condition and effect is conspicuous along the termini of\r\nthe streams draining the northern slope of the Kuen Lun into the Tarim\r\nbasin.[116]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Geographic checks to progress.]\r\n\r\nThe desultory, intermittent, extensive use of the land practised by\r\nhunters and nomads tends, under the growing pressure of population, to\r\npass into the systematic, continuous, intensive use practised by the\r\nfarmer, except where nature presents positive checks to the transition.\r\nThe most obvious check consists in adverse conditions of climate and\r\nsoil. Where agriculture meets insurmountable obstacles, like the intense\r\ncold of Arctic Siberia and Lapland, or the alkaline soils of Nevada and\r\nthe Caspian Depression, or the inadequate rainfall of Mongolia and\r\nCentral Arabia, the land can produce no higher economic and social\r\ngroups than pastoral hordes. Hence shepherd folk are found in their\r\npurest types in deserts and steppes, where conditions early crystallized\r\nthe social form and checked development. [Rainfall map chap. XIV.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Native animal and plant life as factors.]\r\n\r\nAdverse conditions of climate and soil are not the only factors in this\r\nretardation. The very unequal native equipment of the several continents\r\nwith plant and animal forms likely to accelerate the advance to nomadism\r\nand agriculture also enters into the equation. In Australia, the lack of\r\na single indigenous mammal fit for domestication and of all cereals\r\nblocked from the start the pastoral and agricultural development of the\r\nnatives. Hence at the arrival of the Europeans, Australia presented the\r\nunique spectacle of a whole continent with its population still held in\r\nthe vise of nature. The Americas had a limited variety of animals\r\nsusceptible of domestication, but were more meagerly equipped than the\r\nOld World. Yet the Eskimo failed to tame and herd the reindeer, though\r\ntheir precarious food-supply furnished a motive for the transition.\r\nMoreover, an abundance of grass and reindeer moss (_Cladonia\r\nrangiferina_), and congenial climatic conditions favored it especially\r\nfor the Alaskan Eskimo, who had, besides, the nearby example of the\r\nSiberian Chukches as reindeer herders.[117] The buffalo, whose\r\ndomesticability has been proved, was never utilized in this way by the\r\nIndians, though the Spaniard Gomara writes of one tribe, living in the\r\nsixteenth century in the southwestern part of what is now United States\r\nterritory, whose chief wealth consisted in herds of tame buffalo.[118]\r\nNorth America, at the time of the discovery, saw only the dog hanging\r\nabout the lodges of the Indians; but in South America the llama and\r\nalpaca, confined to the higher levels of the Andes (10,000 to 15,000\r\nfeet elevation) were used in domestic herds only in the mountain-rimmed\r\nvalleys of ancient Peru, where, owing to the restricted areas of these\r\nintermontane basins, stock-raising early became stationary,[119] as we\r\nfind it in the Alps. Moreover, the high ridges of the Andes supported a\r\nspecies of grass called _ichu_, growing up to the snowline from the\r\nequator to the southern extremity of Patagonia. Its geographical\r\ndistribution coincided with that of the llama and alpaca, whose chief\r\npasturage it furnished.[120] In contrast, the absence of any wild fodder\r\nplants in Japan, and the exclusion of all foreign forms by the\r\nsuccessful competition of the native bamboo grass have together\r\neliminated pastoral life from the economic history of the island.\r\n\r\nThe Old World, on the other hand, furnished an abundant supply of\r\nindigenous animals susceptible of domestication, and especially those\r\nfitted for nomadic life, such as the camel, horse, ass, sheep and goat.\r\nHence it produced in the widespread grasslands and deserts of Europe,\r\nAsia, and Africa the most perfect types of pastoral development in its\r\nnatural or nomadic form. Moreover, the early history of the civilized\r\nagricultural peoples of these three continents reveals their previous\r\npastoral mode of life.\r\n\r\nNorth and South America offered over most of their area conditions of\r\nclimate and soil highly favorable to agriculture, and a fair list of\r\nindigenous cereals, tubers, and pulses yielding goodly crops even to\r\nsuperficial tillage. Maize especially was admirably suited for a race of\r\nsemi-migratory hunters. It could be sown without plowing, ripened in a\r\nwarm season even in ninety days, could be harvested without a sickle and\r\nat the pleasure of the cultivator, and needed no preparation beyond\r\nroasting before it was ready for food.[121] The beans and pumpkins which\r\nthe Indians raised also needed only a short season. Hence many Indian\r\ntribes, while showing no trace of pastoral development, combined with\r\nthe chase a semi-nomadic agriculture; and in a few districts where\r\ngeographic conditions had applied peculiar pressure, they had\r\naccomplished the transition to sedentary agriculture.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Land per capita under various cultural and geographic\r\nconditions.]\r\n\r\nEvery advance to a higher state of civilization has meant a progressive\r\ndecrease in the amount of land necessary for the support of the\r\nindividual, and a progressive increase in the relations between man and\r\nhis habitat. The stage of social development remaining the same, the per\r\ncapita amount of land decreases also from poorer to better endowed\r\ngeographical districts, and with every invention which brings into use\r\nsome natural resource. The following classification[122] illustrates the\r\nrelation of density of population to various geographic and\r\nsocio-economic conditions.\r\n\r\nHunter tribes on the outskirts of the habitable area, as in Arctic\r\nAmerica and Siberia, require from 70 to 200 square miles per capita; in\r\narid lands, like the Kalahari Desert and Patagonia, 40 to 200 square\r\nmiles per capita; in choice districts and combining with the chase some\r\nprimitive agriculture, as did the Cherokee, Shawnee and Iroquois\r\nIndians, the Dyaks of Borneo and the Papuans of New Guinea, 1/2 to 2\r\nsquare miles per capita.\r\n\r\nPastoral nomads show a density of from 2 to 5 to the square mile;\r\npracticing some agriculture, as in Kordofan and Sennar districts of\r\neastern Sudan, 10 to 15 to the square mile. Agriculture, undeveloped but\r\ncombined with some trade and industry as in Equatorial Africa, Borneo\r\nand most of the Central American states, supports 5 to 15 to the square\r\nmile; practised with European methods in young or colonial lands, as in\r\nArkansas, Texas, Minnesota, Hawaii, Canada and Argentine, or in European\r\nlands with unfavorable climate, up to 25 to the square mile.\r\n\r\nPure agricultural lands of central Europe support 100 to the square\r\nmile, and those of southern Europe, 200; when combining some industry,\r\nfrom 250 to 300. But these figures rise to 500 or more in lowland India\r\nand China. Industrial districts of modern Europe, such as England,\r\nBelgium, Saxony, Departments Nord and Rhone in France, show a density of\r\n500 to 800 to the square mile. [See maps pages 8 and 9.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Density of population and government.]\r\n\r\nWith every increase of the population inhabiting a given area, and with\r\nthe consequent multiplication and constriction of the bonds uniting\r\nsociety with its land, comes a growing necessity for a more highly\r\norganized government, both to reduce friction within and to secure to\r\nthe people the land on which and by which they live. Therefore\r\nprotection becomes a prime function of the state. It wards off outside\r\nattack which may aim at acquisition of its territory, or an invasion of\r\nits rights, or curtailment of its geographic sphere of activity. The\r\nmodern industrial state, furthermore, with the purpose of strengthening\r\nthe nation, assists or itself undertakes the construction of highways,\r\ncanals, and railroads, and the maintenance of steamship lines. These\r\nencourage the development of natural resources and of commerce, and\r\nhence lay the foundation for an increased population, by multiplying the\r\nrelations between land and people.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Territorial expansion of the state.]\r\n\r\nA like object is attained by territorial expansion, which often follows\r\nin the wake of commercial expansion. This strengthens the nation\r\npositively by enlarging its geographic base, and negatively by forcing\r\nback the boundaries of its neighbors. The expansion of the Thirteen\r\nColonies from the Atlantic slope to the Mississippi River and the Great\r\nLakes by the treaty concluding the Revolution was a strong guarantee of\r\nthe survival of the young Republic against future aggressions either of\r\nEngland or Spain, though it exchanged the scientific or protecting\r\nboundary of the Appalachian Mountains for the unscientific and exposed\r\nboundary of a river. The expansion to the Rocky Mountains by the\r\nLouisiana purchase not only gave wider play to national energies,\r\nstimulated natural increase of population, and attracted immigration,\r\nbut it eliminated a dangerous neighbor in the French, and placed a wide\r\nbuffer of untenanted land between the United States and the petty\r\naggressions of the Spanish in Mexico. Rome's expansion into the valley\r\nof the Po, as later into Trans-Alpine Gaul and Germany, had for its\r\npurpose the protection of the peninsula against barbarian inroads.\r\nJapan's recent aggression against the Russians in the Far East was\r\nactuated by the realization that she had to expand into Korea at the\r\ncost of Muscovite ascendency, or contract later at the cost of her own\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Checks to population.]\r\n\r\nIf a state lacks the energy and national purpose, like Italy, or the\r\npossibility, like Switzerland, for territorial expansion, and accepts\r\nits boundaries as final, the natural increase of population upon a fixed\r\narea produces an increased density, unless certain social forces\r\ncounteract it. Without these forces, the relation of men to the land\r\nwould have tended to modify everywhere in the same way. Increase in\r\nnumbers would have been attended by a corresponding decrease in the\r\namount of land at the disposal of each individual. Those states which,\r\nlike Norway and Switzerland, cannot expand and which have exploited\r\ntheir natural resources to the utmost, must resign themselves to the\r\nemigration of their redundant population. But those which have remained\r\nwithin their own boundaries and have adopted a policy of isolation, like\r\nChina, feudal Japan during its two and a half centuries of seclusion,\r\nand numerous Polynesian islands, have been forced to war with nature\r\nitself by checking the operation of the law of natural increase. All the\r\nrepulsive devices contributing to this end, whether infanticide,\r\nabortion, cannibalism, the sanctioned murder of the aged and infirm,\r\nhonorable suicide, polyandry or persistent war, are the social\r\ndeformities consequent upon suppressed growth. Such artificial checks\r\nupon population are more conspicuous in natural regions with sharply\r\ndefined boundaries, like islands and oases, as Malthus observed;[123] but\r\nthey are visible also among savage tribes whose boundaries are fixed not\r\nby natural features but by the mutual repulsion and rivalry\r\ncharacterizing the stage of development, and whose limit of population\r\nis reduced by their low economic status.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Extra-territorial relations.]\r\n\r\nThere is a great difference between those states whose inhabitants\r\nsubsist exclusively from the products of their own country and those\r\nwhich rely more or less upon other lands. Great industrial states, like\r\nEngland and Germany, which derive only a portion of their food and raw\r\nmaterial from their own territory, supply their dense populations\r\nthrough international trade. Interruption of such foreign commerce is\r\ndisastrous to the population at home; hence the state by a navy protects\r\nthe lines of communication with those far-away lands of wheat fields and\r\ncattle ranch. This is no purely modern development. Athens in the time\r\nof Pericles used her navy not only to secure her political domination in\r\nthe Aegean, but also her connections with the colonial wheat lands\r\nabout the Euxine.\r\n\r\nThe modern state strives to render this circle of trade both large and\r\npermanent by means of commercial treaties, customs-unions, trading-posts\r\nand colonies. Thus while society at home is multiplying its relations\r\nwith its own land, the state is enabling it to multiply also its\r\nrelations with the whole producing world. While at home the nation is\r\nbecoming more closely knit together through the common bond of the\r\nfatherland, in the world at large humanity is evolving a brotherhood of\r\nman by the union of each with all through the common growing bond of the\r\nearth. Hence we cannot avoid the question: Are we in process of evolving\r\na social idea vaster than that underlying nationality? Do the Socialists\r\nhint to us the geographic basis of this new development, when they\r\ndescribe themselves as an international political party?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Geography in the philosophy of history.]\r\n\r\nIt is natural that the old philosophy of history should have fixed its\r\nattention upon the geographic basis of historical events. Searching for\r\nthe permanent and common in the outwardly mutable, it found always at\r\nthe bottom of changing events the same solid earth. Biology has had the\r\nsame experience. The history of the life forms of the world leads always\r\nback to the land on which that life arose, spread, and struggled for\r\nexistence. The philosophy of history was superior to early sociology, in\r\nthat its method was one of historical comparison, which inevitably\r\nguided it back to the land as the material for the first generalization.\r\nThus it happens that the importance of the land factor in history was\r\napproached first from the philosophical side. Montesquieu and Herder had\r\nno intention of solving sociological and geographical problems, when\r\nthey considered the relation of peoples and states to their soil; they\r\nwished to understand the purpose and destiny of man as an inhabitant of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Theory of progress from the standpoint of geography.]\r\n\r\nThe study of history is always, from one standpoint, a study of\r\nprogress. Yet after all the century-long investigation of the history of\r\nevery people working out its destiny in its given environment,\r\nstruggling against the difficulties of its habitat, progressing when it\r\novercame them and retrograding when it failed, advancing when it made\r\nthe most of its opportunities and declining when it made less or\r\nsuccumbed to an invader armed with better economic or political methods\r\nto exploit the land, it is amazing how little the land, in which all\r\nactivities finally root, has been taken into account in the discussion\r\nof progress. Nevertheless, for a theory of progress it offers a solid\r\nbasis. From the standpoint of the land social and political\r\norganizations, in successive stages of development, embrace ever\r\nincreasing areas, and make them support ever denser populations; and in\r\nthis concentration of population and intensification of economic\r\ndevelopment they assume ever higher forms. It does not suffice that a\r\npeople, in order to progress, should extend and multiply only its local\r\nrelations to its land. This would eventuate in arrested development,\r\nsuch as Japan showed at the time of Perry's visit. The ideal basis of\r\nprogress is the expansion of the world relations of a people, the\r\nextension of its field of activity and sphere of influence far beyond\r\nthe limits of its own territory, by which it exchanges commodities and\r\nideas with various countries of the world. Universal history shows us\r\nthat, as the geographical horizon of the known world has widened from\r\ngray antiquity to the present, societies and states have expanded their\r\nterritorial and economic scope; that they have grown not only in the\r\nnumber of their square miles and in the geographical range of their\r\ninternational intercourse, but in national efficiency, power, and\r\npermanence, and especially in that intellectual force which feeds upon\r\nthe nutritious food of wide comparisons. Every great movement which has\r\nwidened the geographical outlook of a people, such as the Crusades in\r\nthe Middle Ages, or the colonization of the Americas, has applied an\r\nintellectual and economic stimulus. The expanding field of advancing\r\nhistory has therefore been an essential concomitant and at the same time\r\na driving force in the progress of every people and of the world.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Man's increasing dependence upon nature.]\r\n\r\nSince progress in civilization involves an increasing exploitation of\r\nnatural advantages and the development of closer relations between a\r\nland and its people, it is an erroneous idea that man tends to\r\nemancipate himself more and more from the control of the natural\r\nconditions forming at once the foundation and environment of his\r\nactivities. On the contrary, he multiplies his dependencies upon\r\nnature;[124] but while increasing their sum total, he diminishes the\r\nforce of each. There lies the gist of the matter. As his bonds become\r\nmore numerous, they become also more elastic. Civilization has\r\nlengthened his leash and padded his collar, so that it does not gall;\r\nbut the leash is never slipped. The Delaware Indians depended upon the\r\nforests alone for fuel. A citizen of Pennsylvania, occupying the former\r\nDelaware tract, has the choice of wood, hard or soft coal, coke,\r\npetroleum, natural gas, or manufactured gas. Does this mean\r\nemancipation? By no means. For while fuel was a necessity to the Indian\r\nonly for warmth and cooking, and incidentally for the pleasureable\r\nexcitement of burning an enemy at the stake, it enters into the\r\nmanufacture of almost every article that the Pennsylvanian uses in his\r\ndaily life. His dependence upon nature has become more far-reaching,\r\nthough less conspicuous and especially less arbitrary.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Increase in kind and amount.]\r\n\r\nThese dependencies increase enormously both in variety and amount. Great\r\nBritain, with its twenty thousand merchant ships aggregating over ten\r\nmillion tons, and its immense import and export trade, finds its harbors\r\nvastly more important to-day for the national welfare than in Cromwell's\r\ntime, when they were used by a scanty mercantile fleet. Since the\r\ngeneration of electricity by water-power and its application to\r\nindustry, the plunging falls of the Scandinavian Mountains, of the Alps\r\nof Switzerland, France, and Italy, of the Southern Appalachians and the\r\nCascade Range, are geographical features representing new and\r\nunsuspected forms of national capital, and therefore new bonds between\r\nland and people in these localities. Russia since 1844 has built 35,572\r\nmiles (57,374 kilometers) of railroad in her European territory, and\r\nthereby derived a new benefit from her level plains, which so facilitate\r\nthe construction and cheap operation of railroads, that they have become\r\nin this aspect alone a new feature in her national economy. On the other\r\nhand, the galling restrictions of Russia's meager and strategically\r\nconfined coasts, which tie her hand in any wide maritime policy, work a\r\ngreater hardship to-day than they did a hundred years ago, since her\r\ngrowing population creates a more insistent demand for international\r\ntrade. In contrast to Russia, Norway, with its paucity of arable soil\r\nand of other natural resources, finds its long indented coastline and\r\nthe coast-bred seamanship of its people a progressively important\r\nnational asset. Hence as ocean-carriers the Norwegians have developed a\r\nmerchant marine nearly half as large again as that of Russia and Finland\r\ncombined--1,569,646 tons[125] as against 1,084,165 tons.\r\n\r\nThis growing dependence of a civilized people upon its land is\r\ncharacterized by intelligence and self-help. Man forms a partnership\r\nwith nature, contributing brains and labor, while she provides the\r\ncapital or raw material in ever more abundant and varied forms. As a\r\nresult of this coöperation, held by the terms of the contract, he\r\nsecures a better living than the savage who, like a mendicant, accepts\r\nwhat nature is pleased to dole out, and lives under the tyranny of her\r\ncaprices.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n[79] H.J.

The very names of Turkey, Bulgaria,\r\nEngland, Scotland and France are borrowed from intruding peoples. New\r\nEngland, New France, New Scotland or Nova Scotia and many more on the\r\nAmerican continents register the Trans-Atlantic nativity of their first\r\nwhite settlers. The provinces of Galicia in Spain, Lombardy in Italy,\r\nBrittany in France, Essex and Sussex in England record in their names\r\nstreams of humanity diverted from the great currents of the\r\nVölkerwanderung. The Romance group of languages, from Portugal to\r\nRoumania, testify to the sweep of expanding Rome, just as the wide\r\ndistribution of the Aryan linguistic family points to many roads and\r\nlong migrations from some unplaced birthplace. Names like Cis-Alpine and\r\nTrans-Alpine Gaul in the Roman Empire, Trans-Caucasia, Trans-Caspia and\r\nTrans-Baikalia in the Russian Empire, the Transvaal and Transkei in\r\nSouth Africa, indicate the direction whence the advancing people have\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stratification of races]\r\n\r\nEthnology reveals an east and west stratification of linguistic groups\r\nin Europe, a north and south stratification of races, and another\r\nstratification by altitude, which reappears in all parts of the world,\r\nand shows certain invading dominant races occupying the lowlands and\r\nother displaced ones the highlands. This definite arrangement points to\r\nsuccessive arrivals, a crowding forward, an intrusion of the strong into\r\nfertile, accessible valleys and plains, and a dislodgment of the weak\r\ninto the rough but safe keeping of mountain range or barren peninsula,\r\nwhere they are brought to bay. Ethnic fragments, linguistic survivals,\r\nor merely place names, dropped like discarded baggage along the march\r\nof a retreating army, bear witness everywhere to tragic recessionals.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The name Historical Movement.]\r\n\r\nEvery country whose history we examine proves the recipient of\r\nsuccessive streams of humanity. Even sea-girt England has received\r\nvarious intruding peoples from the Roman occupation to the recent influx\r\nof Russian Jews. In prehistoric times it combined several elements in\r\nits population, as the discovery of the \"long barrow\" men and \"round\r\nbarrow\" men by archaeologists, and the identification of a surviving\r\nIberian or Mediterranean strain by ethnologists go to prove.[126] Egypt,\r\nMesopotamia, and India tell the same story, whether in their recorded or\r\nunrecorded history. Tropical Africa lacks a history; but all that has\r\nbeen pieced together by ethnologists and anthropologists, in an effort\r\nto reconstruct its past, shows incessant movement,--growth, expansion\r\nand short-lived conquest, followed by shrinkage, expulsion or absorption\r\nby another invader.[127] To this constant shifting of races and peoples\r\nthe name of historical movement has been given, because it underlies\r\nmost of written history, and constitutes the major part of unwritten\r\nhistory, especially that of savage and nomadic tribes. Two things are\r\nvital in the history of every people, its ethnic composition and the\r\nwars it wages in defense or extension of its boundaries. Both rest upon\r\nhistorical movements,--intrusions, whether peaceful or hostile, into its\r\nown land, and encroachments upon neighboring territory necessitated by\r\ngrowth. Back of all such movements is natural increase of population\r\nbeyond local means of subsistence, and the development of the war spirit\r\nin the effort to secure more abundant subsistence either by raid or\r\nconquest of territory.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Evolution of the Historical Movement.]\r\n\r\nAmong primitive peoples this movement is simple and monotonous. It\r\ninvolves all members of the tribe, either in pursuit of game, or\r\nfollowing the herd over the tribal territory, or in migrations seeking\r\nmore and better land. Among civilized peoples it assumes various forms,\r\nand especially is differentiated for different members of the social\r\ngroup. The civilized state develops specialized frontiersmen, armies,\r\nexplorers, maritime traders, colonists, and missionaries, who keep a\r\npart of the people constantly moving and directing external expansion,\r\nwhile the mass of the population converts the force once expended in the\r\nmigrant food-quest into internal activity. Here we come upon a paradox.\r\nThe nation as a whole, with the development of sedentary life, increases\r\nits population and therewith its need for external movements; it widens\r\nits national area and its circle of contact with other lands, enlarges\r\nits geographical horizon, and improves its internal communication over a\r\ngrowing territory; it evolves a greater mobility within and without,\r\nwhich attaches, however, to certain classes of society, not to the\r\nentire social group. This mobility becomes the outward expression of a\r\nwhole complex of economic wants, intellectual needs, and political\r\nambitions. It is embodied in the conquests which build up empires, in\r\nthe colonization which develops new lands, in the world-wide exchange of\r\ncommodities and ideas which lifts the level of civilization, till this\r\nmovement of peoples becomes a fundamental fact of history.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nature of primitive movements.]\r\n\r\nThis movement is and has been universal and varied. When most\r\nunobtrusive in its operation, it has produced its greatest effects. To\r\nseize upon a few conspicuous migrations, like the _Völkerwanderung_ and\r\nthe irruption of the Turks into Europe, made dramatic by their relation\r\nto the declining empires of Rome and Constantinople, and to ignore the\r\nvast sum of lesser but more normal movements which by slow increments\r\nproduce greater and more lasting results, leads to wrong conclusions\r\nboth in ethnology and history. Here, as in geology, great effects do not\r\nnecessarily presuppose vast forces, but rather the steady operation of\r\nsmall ones. It is often assumed that the world was peopled by a series\r\nof migrations; whereas everything indicates that humanity spread over\r\nthe earth little by little, much as the imported gypsy moth is gradually\r\noccupying New England or the water hyacinth the rivers of Florida. Louis\r\nAgassiz observed in 1853 that \"the boundaries within which the different\r\nnatural combinations of animals are known to be circumscribed upon the\r\nsurface of the earth, coincide with the natural range of distinct types\r\nof man.\"[128] The close parallelism between Australian race and flora,\r\nEskimo race and Arctic fauna, points to a similar manner of dispersion.\r\nWallace, in describing how the Russian frontier of settlement slowly\r\ncreeps forward along the Volga, encroaching upon the Finnish and Tartar\r\nareas, and permeating them with Slav blood and civilization, adds that\r\nthis is probably the normal method of expansion.[129] Thucydides describes\r\nthe same process of encroachment, displacement, and migration in ancient\r\nHellas.[130] Strabo quotes Posidonius as saying that the emigration of the\r\nCimbrians and other kindred tribes from their native seats was gradual\r\nand by no means sudden.[131] The traditions of the Delaware Indians show\r\ntheir advance from their early home in central Canada southward to the\r\nDelaware River and Chesapeake Bay to have been a slow zigzag movement,\r\ninterrupted by frequent long halts, leaving behind one laggard group\r\nhere and sending out an offshoot there, who formed new tribes and\r\nthereby diversified the stock.[132] It was an aimless wandering, without\r\ndestination and purpose other than to find a pleasanter habitat. The\r\nVandals appear first as \"a loose aggregation of restless tribes who must\r\nnot be too definitely assigned to any precise district on the map,\"\r\nsomewhere in central or eastern Prussia.[133] Far-reaching migrations\r\naiming at a distant goal, like the Gothic and Hunnish conquests of\r\nItaly, demand both a geographical knowledge and an organization too high\r\nfor primitive peoples, and therefore belong to a later period of\r\ndevelopment.[134]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Number and range.]\r\n\r\nThe long list of recorded migrations has been supplemented by the\r\nresearches of ethnologists, which have revealed a multitude of\r\nprehistoric movements. These are disclosed in greater number and range\r\nwith successive investigation. The prehistoric wanderings of the\r\nPolynesians assume far more significance to-day than a hundred years\r\nago, when their scope was supposed to have its western limit at Fiji and\r\nthe Ellice group. They have now been traced to almost every island of\r\nMelanesia; vestiges of their influence have been detected in the\r\nlanguages of Australia, and the culture of the distant coasts of Alaska\r\nand British Columbia. The western pioneers of America knew the Shoshone\r\nIndians as small bands of savages, constantly moving about in search of\r\nfood in the barren region west of the Rocky Mountains, and occasionally\r\nventuring eastward to hunt buffalo on the plains. Recent investigation\r\nhas identified as offshoots of this retarded Shoshonean stock the\r\nsedentary agriculturalists of the Moqui Pueblo, and the advanced\r\npopulations of ancient Mexico and Central America.[135] Here was a great\r\nhuman current which through the centuries slowly drifted from the\r\npresent frontier of Canada to the shores of Lake Nicaragua. Powell's map\r\nof the distribution of the linguistic stocks of American Indians is\r\nintelligible only in the light of constant mobility. Haebler's map of\r\nthe South American stocks reveals the same restless past. This\r\ncartographical presentation of the facts, giving only the final results,\r\nsuggests tribal excursions of the nature of migrations; but ethnologists\r\nsee them as the sum total of countless small movements which are more or\r\nless part of the normal activity of an unrooted savage people. [Map page\r\n101.]\r\n\r\nOtis Mason finds that the life of a social group involves a variety of\r\nmovements characterized by different ranges or scopes. I. The daily\r\nround from bed to bed. II. The annual round from year to year, like that\r\nof the Tunguse Orochon of Siberia who in pursuit of various fish and\r\ngame change their residence within their territory from month to month,\r\nor the pastoral nomads who move with the seasons from pasture to\r\npasture. III. Less systematic outside movements covering the tribal\r\nsphere of influence, such as journeys or voyages to remote hunting or\r\nfishing grounds, forays or piratical descents upon neighboring lands\r\neventuating usually in conquest, expansion into border regions for\r\noccasional occupation or colonization. IV. Participation in streams of\r\nbarter or commerce. V. And at a higher stage in the great currents of\r\nhuman intercourse, experience, and ideas, which finally compass the\r\nworld.[136] In all this series the narrower movement prepares for the\r\nbroader, of which it constitutes at once an impulse and a part.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Importance of such movements in history.]\r\n\r\nThe real character and importance of these movements have been\r\nappreciated by broad-minded historians. Thucydides elucidates the\r\nconditions leading up to the Peloponnesian War by a description of the\r\nsemi-migratory population of Hellas, the exposure of the more fertile\r\ndistricts to incursions, and the influence of these movements in\r\ndifferentiating Dorian from Ionian Greece.[137] Johannes von Muller, in\r\nthe introduction to his history of Switzerland, assigns to federations\r\nand migrations a conspicuous rôle in historical development. Edward A.\r\nRoss sees in such movements a thorough-going selective process which\r\nweeds out the unfit, or rather spares only the highly fit. He lays down\r\nthe principle that repeated migrations tend to the creation of energetic\r\nraces of men. He adds, \"This principle may account for the fact that\r\nthose branches of a race achieve the most brilliant success which have\r\nwandered the farthest from their ancestral home.... The Arabs and Moors\r\nthat skirted Africa and won a home in far-away Spain, developed the most\r\nbrilliant of the Saracen civilizations. Hebrews, Dorians, Quirites,\r\nRajputs, Hovas were far invaders. No communities in classic times\r\nflourished like the cities of Asia created by the overflow from Greece.\r\nNowhere under the Czar are there such vigorous, progressive communities\r\nas in Siberia.\"[138] Brinton distinguishes the associative and dispersive\r\nelements in ethnography. The latter is favored by the physical\r\nadaptability of the human race to all climates and external conditions;\r\nit is stimulated by the food-quest, the pressure of foes, and the\r\nresultant restlessness of an unstable primitive society.[139]\r\n\r\nThe earth's surface is at once factor and basis in these movements. In\r\nan active way it directs them; but they in turn clothe the passive earth\r\nwith a mantle of humanity. This mantle is of varied weave and thickness,\r\nshowing here the simple pattern of a primitive society, there the\r\nintricate design of advanced civilization; here a closely woven or a\r\ngauzy texture, there disclosing a great rent where a rocky peak or the\r\nice-wrapped poles protrude through the warm human covering. This is the\r\nmagic web whereof man is at once woof and weaver, and the flying shuttle\r\nthat never rests. Given a region, what is its living envelope, asks\r\nanthropo-geography. Whence and how did it get there? What is the\r\nmaterial of warp and woof? Will new threads enter to vary the color and\r\ndesign? If so, from what source? Or will the local pattern repeat itself\r\nover and over with dull uniformity?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Geographical interpretation of historical movement.]\r\n\r\nIt was the great intellectual service of Copernicus that he conceived of\r\na world in motion instead of a world at rest. So anthropo-geography must\r\nsee its world in motion, whether it is considering English colonization,\r\nor the westward expansion of the Southern slave power in search of\r\nunexhausted land, or the counter expansion of the free-soil movement, or\r\nthe early advance of the trappers westward to the Rockies after the\r\nretreating game, or the withdrawal thither of the declining Indian\r\ntribes before the protruding line of white settlement, and their\r\nultimate confinement to ever shrinking reservations. In studying\r\nincrease of population, it sees in Switzerland chalet and farm creeping\r\nhigher up the Alp, as the lapping of a rising tide of humanity below; it\r\nsees movement in the projection of a new dike in Holland to reclaim from\r\nthe sea the land for another thousand inhabitants, movement in Japan's\r\ndoubling of its territory by conquest, in order to house and feed its\r\nredundant millions.\r\n\r\nThe whole complex relation of unresting man to the earth is the subject\r\nmatter of anthropo-geography. The science traces his movements on the\r\nearth's surface, measures their velocity, range, and recurrence,\r\ndetermines their nature by the way they utilize the land, notes their\r\ntransformation at different stages of economic development and under\r\ndifferent environments. Just as an understanding of animal and plant\r\ngeography requires a previous knowledge of the various means of\r\ndispersal, active and passive, possessed by these lower forms of life,\r\nso anthropo-geography must start with a study of the movements of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mobility of primitive peoples.]\r\n\r\nFirst of all is to be noted an evolution in the mobility of peoples. In\r\nthe lower stages of culture mobility is great. It is favored by the\r\npersistent food-quest over wide areas incident to retarded economic\r\nmethods, and by the loose attachment of society to the soil. The small\r\nsocial groups peculiar to these stages and their innate tendency to\r\nfission help the movements to ramify. The consequent scattered\r\ndistribution of the population offers wide interstices between\r\nencampments or villages, and into these vacant spaces other wandering\r\ntribes easily penetrate. The rapid decline of the Indian race in America\r\nbefore the advancing whites was due chiefly to the division of the\r\nsavages into small groups, scattered sparsely over a wide territory.\r\nHunter and pastoral peoples need far more land than they can occupy at\r\nany one time. Hence the temporarily vacant spots invite incursion.\r\nMoreover, the slight impedimenta carried by primitive folk minimize the\r\nnatural physical obstacles which they meet when on the march. The\r\nlightly equipped war parties of the Shawnee Indians used gorges and gaps\r\nfor the passage of the Allegheny Mountains which were prohibitive to all\r\nwhite pioneers except the lonely trapper. Finally, this mobility gets\r\ninto the primitive mind. The _Wanderlust_ is strong. Long residence in\r\none territory is irksome, attachment is weak. Therefore a small cause\r\nsuffices to start the whole or part of the social body moving. A\r\ntemporary failure of the food supply, cruelty or excessive exaction of\r\ntribute on the part of the chief, occasions an exodus. The history of\r\nevery negro tribe in Africa gives instances of such secessions, which\r\noften leave whole districts empty and exposed to the next wandering\r\noccupant. Methods of preventing such withdrawals, and therewith the\r\ndiminution of his treasury receipts and his fighting force, belong to\r\nthe policy of every negro chieftain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Natural barriers to movement.]\r\n\r\nThe checks to this native mobility of primitive peoples are two:\r\nphysical and mental. In addition to the usual barriers of mountains,\r\ndeserts, and seas before the invention of boats, primeval forests have\r\nalways offered serious obstacles to man armed only with stone or bronze\r\naxe, and they rebuffed even man of the iron age. War and hunting parties\r\nhad to move along the natural clearings of the rivers, the tracks of\r\nanimals, or the few trails beaten out in time by the natives themselves.\r\nPrimitive agriculture has never battled successfully against the phalanx\r\nof the trees. Forests balked the expansion of the Inca civilization on\r\nthe rainy slope of the Andes, and in Central Africa the negro invaded\r\nonly their edges for his yam fields and plantain groves. The earliest\r\nsettlements in ancient Britain were confined to the natural clearings of\r\nthe chalk downs and oolitic uplands; and here population was chiefly\r\nconcentrated even at the close of the Roman occupation. Only gradually,\r\nas the valley woodlands were cleared, did the richer soil of the\r\nalluvial basins attract men from the high, poor ground where tillage\r\nrequired no preliminary work. But after four centuries of Roman rule and\r\nRoman roads, the clearings along the river valleys were still mere\r\nstrips of culture mid an encompassing wilderness of woods. When the\r\nGermanic invaders came, they too appropriated the treeless downs and\r\nwere blocked by the forests.[140] On the other hand, grasslands and\r\nsavannahs have developed the most mobile people whom we know, steppe\r\nhunters like the Sioux Indians and Patagonians. Thus while the forest\r\ndweller, confined to the highway of the stream, devised only canoe and\r\ndugout boat in various forms for purposes of transportation, steppe\r\npeoples of the Old World introduced the use of draft and pack animals,\r\nand invented the sledge and cart.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effect of geographical horizon.]\r\n\r\nPrimitive peoples carry a drag upon their migrations in their restricted\r\ngeographical outlook; ignorance robs them of definite goals. The\r\nevolution of the historical movement is accelerated by every expansion\r\nof the geographical horizon. It progresses most rapidly where the\r\nknowledge of outlying or remote lands travels fastest, as along rivers\r\nand thalassic coasts. Rome's location as toll-gate keeper of the Tiber\r\ngave her knowledge of the upstream country and directed her conquest of\r\nits valley; and the movement thus started gathered momentum as it\r\nadvanced. Cæsar's occupation of Gaul meant to his generation simply the\r\ncommand of the roads leading from the Mediterranean to the northern\r\nsources of tin and amber, and the establishment of frontier outposts to\r\nprotect the land boundaries of Italy; this represented a bold policy of\r\ninland expansion for that day. The modern historian sees in that step\r\nthe momentous advance of history beyond the narrow limits of the\r\nMediterranean basin, and its gradual inclusion of all the Atlantic\r\ncountries of Europe, through whose maritime enterprise the historical\r\nhorizon was stretched to include America. In the same way, mediæval\r\ntrade with the Orient, which had familiarized Europe with distant India\r\nand Cathay, developed its full historico-geographical importance when it\r\nstarted the maritime discoveries of the fifteenth century. The expansion\r\nof the geographical horizon in 1512 to embrace the earth inaugurated a\r\nwidespread historical movement, which has resulted in the\r\nEuropeanization of the world.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Civilization and mobility.]\r\n\r\nCivilized man is at once more and less mobile than his primitive\r\nbrother. Every advance in civilization multiplies and tightens the bonds\r\nuniting him with his soil; makes him a sedentary instead of a migratory\r\nbeing. On the other hand every advance in civilization is attended by\r\nthe rapid clearing of the forests, by the construction of bridges and\r\ninterlacing roads, the invention of more effective vehicles for\r\ntransportation whereby intercourse increases, and the improvement of\r\nnavigation to the same end. Civilized man progressively modifies the\r\nland which he occupies, removes or reduces obstacles to intercourse, and\r\nthereby approximates it to the open plain. Thus far he facilitates\r\nmovements. But while doing this he also places upon the land a dense\r\npopulation, closely attached to the soil, strong to resist incursion,\r\nand for economic reasons inhospitable to any marked accession of\r\npopulation from without. Herein lies the great difference between\r\nmigration in empty or sparsely inhabited regions, such as predominated\r\nwhen the world was young, and in the densely populated countries of our\r\nera. As the earth grew old and humanity multiplied, peoples themselves\r\nbecame the greatest barriers to any massive migrations, till in certain\r\ncountries of Europe and Asia the historical movement has been reduced to\r\na continual pressure, resulting in compression of population here,\r\nrepression there. Hence, though political boundaries may shift, ethnic\r\nboundaries scarcely budge. The greatest wars of modern Europe have\r\nhardly left a trace upon the distribution of its peoples. Only in the\r\nBalkan Peninsula, as the frontiers of the Turkish Empire have been\r\nforced back from the Danube, the alien Turks have withdrawn to the\r\nshrinking territory of the Sultan and especially to Asia Minor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Diffusion of culture.]\r\n\r\nWhere a population too great to be dislodged occupies the land, conquest\r\nresults in the eventual absorption of the victors and their civilization\r\nby the native folk, as happened to the Lombards in Italy, the Vandals in\r\nAfrica and the Normans in England. Where the invaders are markedly\r\nsuperior in culture though numerically weak, conquest results in the\r\ngradual permeation of the conquered with the religion, economic methods,\r\nlanguage, and customs of the new-comers.[141] The latter process, too, is\r\nalways attended by some intermixture of blood, where no race repulsion\r\nexists, but this is small in comparison to the diffusion of\r\ncivilization. This was the method by which Greek traders and colonists\r\nHellenized the countries about the eastern Mediterranean, and spread\r\ntheir culture far back from the shores which their settlements had\r\nappropriated. In this way Saracen armies soon after the death of\r\nMohammed Arabized the whole eastern and southern sides of the\r\nMediterranean from Syria to Spain, and Arab merchants set the stamp of\r\ntheir language and religion on the coasts of East Africa as far as\r\nMoçambique. The handful of Spanish adventurers who came upon the\r\nrelatively dense populations of Mexico and Peru left among them a\r\ncivilization essentially European, but only a thin strain of Castilian\r\nblood. Thus the immigration of small bands of people sufficed to\r\ninfluence the culture of that big territory known as Latin America.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ethnic intermixture.]\r\n\r\nThat vast sum of migrations, great and small, which we group under the\r\ngeneral term of historical movement has involved an endless mingling of\r\nraces and cultures. As Professor Petrie has remarked, the prevalent\r\nnotion that in prehistoric times races were pure and unmixed is without\r\nfoundation. An examination of the various forms of the historical\r\nmovement reveals the extent and complexity of this mingling process.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, no migration is ever simple; it involves a number\r\nof secondary movements, each of which in turn occasions a new\r\ncombination of tribal or racial elements. The transference of a whole\r\npeople from its native or adopted seat to a new habitat, as in the\r\n_Völkerwanderungen_, empties the original district, which then becomes\r\na catchment basin for various streams of people about its rim; and in\r\nthe new territory it dislodges a few or all of the occupants, and\r\nthereby starts up a fresh movement as the original one comes to rest.\r\n\r\nNor is this all. A torrent that issues from its source in the mountains\r\nis not the river which reaches the sea. On its long journey from\r\nhighland to lowland it receives now the milky waters of a glacier-fed\r\nstream, now a muddy tributary from agricultural lands, now the clear\r\nwaters from a limestone plateau, while all the time its racing current\r\nbears a burden of soil torn from its own banks. Now it rests in a lake,\r\nwhere it lays down its weight of silt, then goes on, perhaps across an\r\narid stretch where its water is sucked up by the thirsty air or\r\ndiverted to irrigate fields of grain. So with those rivers of men which\r\nwe call migrations. The ethnic stream may start comparatively pure, but\r\nit becomes mixed on the way. From time to time it leaves behind laggard\r\nelements which in turn make a new racial blend where they stop. Such\r\nwere the six thousand Aduatici whom Cæsar found in Belgian Gaul. These\r\nwere a detachment of the migrating Cimbri, left there in charge of\r\nsurplus cattle and baggage while the main body went on to Italy.[142]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Complex currents of migration.]\r\n\r\nA migration rarely involves a single people even at the start. It\r\nbecomes contagious either by example or by the subjection of several\r\nneighboring tribes to the same impelling force, by reason of which all\r\nstart at or near the same time. We find the Cimbri and Teutons combined\r\nwith Celts from the island of Batavia[143] in the first Germanic invasion\r\nof the Roman Empire. Jutes, Saxons and Angles started in close\r\nsuccession for Britain, and the Saxon group included Frisians.[144] An\r\nunavoidable concomitant of great migrations, especially those of nomads,\r\nis their tendency to sweep into the vortex of their movement any people\r\nwhom they brush on the way. Both individuals and tribes are thus caught\r\nup by the current. The general convergence of the central German tribes\r\ntowards the Danube frontier of the Roman Empire during the Marcomannic\r\nWar drew in its train the Lombards from the lower Elbe down to the\r\nmiddle Danube and Theiss.[145] The force of the Lombards invading Italy\r\nin 568 included twenty thousand Saxons from Swabia, Gepidae from the\r\nmiddle Danube, Bulgarians, Slavs from the Russian Ukraine, together with\r\nvarious tribes from the Alpine district of Noricum and the fluvial\r\nplains of Pannonia. Two centuries later the names of these non-Lombard\r\ntribes still survived in certain villages of Italy which had formed\r\ntheir centers.[146] The army which Attila the Hun brought into Gaul was a\r\nmotley crowd, comprising peoples of probable Slav origin from the\r\nRussian steppes, Teutonic Ostrogoths and Gepidae, and numerous German\r\ntribes, besides the Huns themselves. When this horde withdrew after the\r\ndeath of Attila, Gepidae and Ostrogoths settled along the middle Danube,\r\nand the Slavonic contingent along the Alpine courses of the Drave and\r\nSave Rivers.[147] The Vandal migration which in 409 invaded Spain\r\nincluded the Turanian Alans and the German Suevi. The Alans found a\r\ntemporary home in Portugal, which they later abandoned to join the\r\nVandal invasion of North Africa, while the Suevi settled permanently in\r\nthe northwestern mountains of Spain. The Vandals occupied in Spain two\r\nwidely separated districts, one in the mountain region of Galicia next\r\nto the Suevi, and the other in the fertile valley of Andalusia in the\r\nsouth, while the northeastern part of the peninsula was occupied by\r\nintruding Visigoths.[148] Add to these the original Iberian and Celtic\r\nstocks of the peninsula and the Roman strain previously introduced, and\r\nthe various elements which have entered into the Spanish people become\r\napparent.[149]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cultural modification during migration.]\r\n\r\nThe absorption of foreign elements is not confined to large groups whose\r\nnames come down in history, nor is the ensuing modification one of blood\r\nalone. Every land migration or expansion of a people passes by or\r\nthrough the territories of other peoples; by these it is inevitably\r\ninfluenced in point of civilization, and from them individuals are\r\nabsorbed into the wandering throng by marriage or adoption, or a score\r\nof ways. This assimilation of blood and local culture is facilitated by\r\nthe fact that the vast majority of historical movements are slow, a\r\nleisurely drift. Even the great _Völkerwanderung_, which history has\r\nshown us generally in the moment of swift, final descent upon the\r\nimperial city, in reality consisted of a succession of advances with\r\nlong halts between. The Vandals, whose original seats were probably in\r\ncentral or eastern Prussia, drifted southward with the general movement\r\nof the German barbarians toward the borders of the Empire late in the\r\nsecond century, and, after the Marcomannic War (175 A.D.), settled in\r\nDacia north of the lower Danube under the Roman sway. In 271 they were\r\nlocated on the middle Danube, and sixty years afterwards in Moravia.\r\nLater they settled for seventy years in Pannonia within the Empire,\r\nwhere they assimilated Roman civilization and adopted the Arian form of\r\nChristianity from their Gothic neighbors.[150] In Spain, as we have seen,\r\nthey occupied Galicia and Andalusia for a time before passing over into\r\nAfrica in 429. Here was a migration lasting two centuries and a half,\r\nreaching from the Baltic to the southern shores of the Mediterranean,\r\nstarting on the bleak sterile plains of the north amid barbarous\r\nneighbors, ending in the sunny grain fields and rich cities of Roman\r\nAfrica. The picture which we get of the victorious Vandals parceling out\r\nthe estates of Roman nobles, and, from the standpoint of their more\r\nliberal faith, profiting by the dissensions of the two Catholic sects of\r\nAfrica, shows us a people greatly modified by their long sweep through\r\nthe civilized outskirts of the Empire. So it was with the Lombards and\r\nGoths who invaded Italy.\r\n\r\nAmong primitive tribes, who move in smaller groups and must conform\r\nclosely to the dictates of their environment, the modifying effects of\r\npeople and land through which they pass are conspicuous. Ratzel\r\ndescribes the gradual withdrawal of a Hottentot people from western Cape\r\nColony far into the arid interior before the advance of Kaffirs and\r\nEuropeans by saying: \"The stock and name of the Namaquas wandered\r\nnorthward, acquiring new elements, and in course of time filling the old\r\nmold with new contents.\"[151] This is the typical result of such\r\nprimitive movements. The migration of the Delaware Indians from an early\r\nhome somewhere northwest of the Great Lakes to their historical habitat\r\nbetween the Hudson and Potomac Rivers was a slow progress, which\r\nsomewhere brought them into contact with maize-growing tribes, and gave\r\nthem their start in agriculture.[152] The transit lands through which\r\nthese great race journeys pass exercise a modifying effect chiefly\r\nthrough their culture and their peoples, less through their physical\r\nfeatures and climate. For that the stay of the visitants is generally\r\ntoo brief.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effect of early maritime migration.]\r\n\r\nEven early maritime migrants did not keep their strains pure. The\r\nuntried navigator sailing from island to headland, hugging the coast and\r\nputting ashore for water, came into contact with the natives. Cross\r\ncurrents of migration can be traced in Polynesian waters, where certain\r\nislands are nodal points which have given and received of races and\r\nculture through centuries of movement. The original white population of\r\nUruguay differed widely from that of the other Spanish republics of\r\nSouth America. Its nucleus was a large immigration of Canary Islanders.\r\nThese were descendants of Spaniards and the native Guanches of the\r\nCanaries, mingled also with Norman, Flemish and Moorish blood.[153] The\r\nNorse on their way to Iceland may have picked up a Celtic element in the\r\nislands north of Scotland; but from the Faroe group onward they found\r\nonly empty Iceland and Greenland. This was an exceptional experience.\r\nEarly navigation, owing to its limitations, purposely restricted itself\r\nto the known. Men voyaged where men had voyaged before and were to be\r\nfound. Journeys into the untenanted parts of the world were rare.\r\nHowever, the probable eastward expansion of the Eskimo along the Arctic\r\nrim of North America belongs in this class, so that this northern folk\r\nhas suffered no modification from contact with others, except where\r\nAlaska approaches Asia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The transit land.]\r\n\r\nThe land traversed by a migrating horde is not to be pictured as a dead\r\nroad beneath their feet, but rather as a wide region of transit and\r\ntransition, potent to influence them by its geography and people, and to\r\nmodify them in the course of their passage. The route which they follow\r\nis a succession of habitats, in which they linger and domicile\r\nthemselves for a while, though not long enough to lose wholly the habits\r\nof life and thought acquired in their previous dwelling place. Although\r\nnature in many places, by means of valleys, low plains, mountain passes\r\nor oasis lines, points out the way of these race movements, it is safer\r\nto think and speak of this way as a transit land, not as a path or road.\r\nEven where the district of migration has been the sea, as among the\r\nCaribs of the Antilles Islands, the Moros of the Philippines, and the\r\nPolynesians of the Pacific, man sends his roots like a water plant down\r\ninto the restless element beneath, and reflects its influence in all his\r\nthought and activities.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: War as a form of the historical movement.]\r\n\r\nEvery aggressive historical movement, whether bold migration or forcible\r\nextension of the home territory, involves displacement or passive\r\nmovement of other peoples (except in those rare occupations of vacant\r\nlands), who in turn are forced to encroach upon the lands of others.\r\nThese conditions involve war, which is an important form of the\r\nhistorical movement, contributing to new social contacts and fusion of\r\nracial stocks. Raids and piratical descents are often the preliminary\r\nof great historical movements. They first expand the geographical\r\nhorizon, and end in permanent settlements, which involve finally\r\nconsiderable transfers of population, summoned to strengthen the\r\nposition of the interloper. Such was the history of the Germanic\r\ninvasions of Britain, the Scandinavian settlements on the shores of\r\nIceland, Britain, and France, and the incursions of Saharan tribes into\r\nthe Sudanese states. Among pastoral nomads war is the rule; the tribe, a\r\nmobilized nation, is always on a war footing with its neighbors. The\r\nscant supply of wells and pasturage, inadequate in the dry season,\r\ninvolves rivalry and conflict for their possession as agricultural lands\r\ndo not. Failure of water or grass is followed by the decline of the\r\nherds, and then by marauding expeditions into the river valleys to\r\nsupply the temporary want of food. When population increases beyond the\r\nlimits of subsistence in the needy steppes, such raids become the rule\r\nand end in the conquest of the more favored lands, with resulting\r\namalgamation of race and culture.[154]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Primitive war.]\r\n\r\nThe wars of savage and pastoral peoples affect the whole tribe. All the\r\nable-bodied men are combatants, and all the women and children\r\nconstitute the spoils of war in case of defeat. This fact is important,\r\nsince the purpose of primitive conflicts is to enslave and pillage,\r\nrather than to acquire land. The result is that a whole district may be\r\nlaid waste, but when the devastators withdraw, it is gradually\r\nrepopulated by bordering tribes, who make new ethnic combinations. After\r\nthe destruction of the Eries by the Iroquois in 1655, Ohio was left\r\npractically uninhabited for a hundred and fifty years. Then the\r\nIroquoian Wyandots extended their settlements into northwestern Ohio\r\nfrom their base in southern Michigan, while the Miami Confederacy along\r\nthe southern shore of Lake Michigan pushed their borders into the\r\nwestern part. The Muskingum Valley in the eastern portion was occupied\r\nabout 1750 by Delawares from eastern Pennsylvania, the Scioto by\r\nShawnees, and the northeast corner of the territory by detachments of\r\nIroquois, chiefly Senecas.[155] The long wars between the Algonquin\r\nIndians of the north and the Appalachian tribes of the south kept the\r\ndistrict of Kentucky a No Man's Land, in convenient vacancy for\r\noccupation by the white settlers, when they began the westward\r\nmovement.[156] [Map page 156.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Slavery as form of historical movement.]\r\n\r\nThis desolation is produced partly by killing, but chiefly by\r\nenslavement of prisoners and the flight of the conquered. Both\r\nconstitute compulsory migrations of far-reaching effect in the fusion of\r\nraces and the blending of civilizations. The thousands of Greek slaves\r\nwho were brought to ancient Rome contributed to its refinement and\r\npolish. All the nations of the known world, from Briton to Syrian and\r\nJew, were represented in the slave markets of the imperial capital, and\r\ncontributed their elements to the final composition of the Roman people.\r\nWhen we read of ninety-seven thousand Hebrews whom Titus sold into\r\nbondage after the fall of Jerusalem, of forty thousand Greeks sold by\r\nLucullus after one victory, and the auction _sub corona_ of whole tribes\r\nin Gaul by Cæsar, the scale of this forcible transfer becomes apparent,\r\nand its power as an agent of race amalgamation. Senator Sam Houston of\r\nTexas, speaking of the Comanche Indians, in the United States Senate,\r\nDecember 31, 1854, said: \"There are not less than two thousand prisoners\r\n(whites) in the hands of the Comanches, four hundred in one band in my\r\nown state.... They take no prisoners but women and boys.\"[157] It was\r\ncustomary among the Indians to use captured women as concubines and to\r\nadopt into the tribe such boys as survived the cruel treatment to which\r\nthey were subjected. Since the Comanches in 1847 were variously\r\nestimated to number from nine to twelve thousand,[158] so large a\r\nproportion of captives would modify the native stock.\r\n\r\nIn Africa slavery has been intimately associated with agriculture as a\r\nsource of wealth, and therefore has lent motive to intertribal wars.\r\nCaptives were enslaved and then gradually absorbed into the tribe of\r\ntheir masters. Thus war and slavery contributed greatly to that\r\nwidespread blending of races which characterizes negro Africa. Slaves\r\nbecame a medium of exchange and an article of commerce with other\r\ncontinents. The negro slave trade had its chief importance in the eyes\r\nof ethnologists and historians because, in distributing the black races\r\nin white continents, it has given a \"negro question\" to the United\r\nStates, superseded the native Indian stock of the Antilles by negroes,\r\nand left a broad negro strain in the blood of Colombia, Venezuela, and\r\nBrazil. This particular historical movement, which during the two\r\ncenturies of its greatest activity involved larger numbers than the\r\nTartar invasion of Russia or the Turkish invasion of Europe, for a long\r\nperiod gave to black Africa the only historical importance which it\r\npossessed for the rest of the world.[159]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fusion by deported and military colonies.]\r\n\r\nIn higher stages of political development, war aiming at the subjugation\r\nof large territories finds another means to fuse the subject peoples and\r\nassimilate them to a common standard of civilization. The purpose is\r\nunification and the obliteration of local differences. These are also\r\nthe unconscious ends of evolution by historical movement. With this\r\nobject, conquerors the world over have used a system of tribal and\r\nracial exchanges. It was the policy of the Incas of ancient Peru to\r\nremove conquered tribes to distant parts of the realm, and supply their\r\nplaces with colonists from other districts who had long been subjected\r\nand were more or less assimilated.[160] In 722 B.C. the Assyrian king,\r\nSargon, overran Samaria, carried away the Ten Tribes of Israel beyond\r\nthe Tigris and scattered them among the cities of Media, where they\r\nprobably merged with the local population. To the country left vacant by\r\ntheir wholesale deportation he transplanted people from Babylon and\r\nother Mesopotamian cities.[161] The descendants of these, mingled with\r\nthe poorer class of Jews still left there, formed the despised\r\nSamaritans of the time of Christ. The Kingdom of Judah later was\r\ndespoiled by Nebuchadnezzar of much of its population, which was carried\r\noff to Babylon.\r\n\r\nThis plan of partial deportation and colonization characterized the\r\nRoman method of Romanization. Removal of the conquered from their native\r\nenvironment facilitated the process, while it weakened the spirit and\r\npower of revolt. The Romans met bitter opposition from the mountain\r\ntribes when trying to open up the northern passes of the Apennines.\r\nConsequently they removed the Ligurian tribe of the Apuanians,\r\nforty-seven thousand in number, far south to Samnium. When in 15 B.C.\r\nthe region of the Rhaetian Alps was joined to the Empire, forty\r\nthousand of the inhabitants were transplanted from the mountains to the\r\nplain. The same method was used with the Scordisci and Dacians of the\r\nDanube. More often the mortality of war so thinned the population, that\r\nthe settlement of Roman military colonies among them sufficed to keep\r\ndown revolt and to Romanize the surviving fragment. The large area of\r\nRomance speech found in Roumania and eastern Hungary, despite the\r\ncontroversy about its origin,[162] seems to have had its chief source in\r\nthe extensive Roman colonies planted by the Emperor Trajan in conquered\r\nDacia.[163] In Iberian Spain, which bitterly resisted Romanization, the\r\nprocess was facilitated by the presence of large garrisons of soldiers.\r\nBetween 196 and 169 B.C. the troops amounted to one hundred and fifty\r\nthousand, and many of them remained in the country as colonists.[164]\r\nCompare the settlement of Scotch troops in French Canada by land grants\r\nafter 1763, resulting in the survival to-day of sandy hair, blue eyes,\r\nand highland names among the French-speaking _habitants_ of Murray Bay\r\nand other districts. The Turks in the fifteenth century brought large\r\nbodies of Moslem converts from Asia Minor to garrison Macedonia and\r\nThessaly, thereby robbing the Anatolian Plateau of half its original\r\npopulation. Into the vacuum thus formed a current of nomads from inner\r\nAsia has poured ever since.[165]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Withdrawal and flight.]\r\n\r\nEvery active historical movement which enters an already populated\r\ncountry gives rise there to passive movements, either compression of the\r\nnative folk followed by amalgamation, or displacement and withdrawal.\r\nThe latter in some degree attends every territorial encroachment. Only\r\nwhere there is an abundance of free land can a people retire as a whole\r\nbefore the onslaught, and maintain their national or racial solidarity.\r\nThus the Slavs seem largely to have withdrawn before the Germans in the\r\nBaltic plains of Europe. The Indians of North and South America retired\r\nwestward before the advance of the whites from the Atlantic coast. The\r\nCherokee nation, who once had a broad belt of country extending from the\r\nTennessee Valley through South Carolina to the ocean,[166] first\r\nretracted their frontier to the Appalachian Mountains; in 1816 they were\r\nconfined to an ever shrinking territory on the middle Tennessee and the\r\nsouthern end of the highlands; in 1818 they began to retire beyond the\r\nMississippi, and in 1828 beyond the western boundary of Arkansas.[167]\r\nThe story of the Shawnees and Delawares is a replica of this.[168] In the\r\nsame way Hottentots and Kaffirs in South Africa are withdrawing\r\nnorthward and westward into the desert before the protruding frontier of\r\nwhite settlement, as the Boers before the English treked farther into\r\nthe veldt. [See map page 105.]\r\n\r\nWhere the people attacked or displaced is small or a broken remnant, it\r\noften takes refuge among a neighboring or kindred tribe. The small\r\nSiouan tribes of the Carolinas, reduced to fragments by repeated\r\nIroquois raids, combined with their Siouan kinsmen the Catawbas, who\r\nconsequently in 1743 included twenty dialects among their little\r\nband.[169] The Iroquoian Tuscaroras of North Carolina, defeated and\r\nweakened by the whites in 1711, fled north to the Iroquois of New York,\r\nwhere they formed the Sixth Nation of the Confederation. The Yamese\r\nIndians, who shifted back and forth between the borders of Florida and\r\nSouth Carolina, defeated first by the whites and then by the Creeks,\r\nfound a refuge for the remnant of their tribe among the Seminoles, in\r\nwhom they merged and disappeared as a distinct tribe[170]--the fate of\r\nmost of these fragmentary peoples. [See map page 54.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dispersal in flight.]\r\n\r\nWhen the fugitive body is large, it is forced to split up in order to\r\nescape. Hence every fugitive movement tends to assume the character of a\r\ndispersal, all the more as organization and leadership vanish in the\r\ncatastrophe. The fissile character of primitive societies especially\r\ncontributes to this end, so that almost every story of Indian and native\r\nAfrican warfare tells of shattered remnants fleeing in several\r\ndirections. Among civilized peoples, the dispersal is that of\r\nindividuals and has far-reaching historical effects. After the\r\ndestruction of Jerusalem, the Jews were scattered over the earth, the\r\ndebris of a nation. The religious wars of France during the sixteenth\r\nand seventeenth centuries caused Huguenots to flee to Switzerland,\r\nGermany, Holland, England, and South Carolina; they even tried to\r\nestablish a colony on the coast of Brazil. Everywhere they contributed a\r\nvaluable element to the economic and social life of the community which\r\nthey joined. The great schism in the Russian Church became an agent of\r\nemigration and colonization. It helped to spread the Russian nationality\r\nover remote frontier regions of the empire which previously had been\r\nalmost exclusively Asiatic; and distributed groups of dissenters in the\r\nneighboring provinces of Turkey, Roumania, Austria, Poland and\r\nPrussia.[171]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Natural regions of retreat.]\r\n\r\nThe hope of safety from pursuit drives fugitive peoples into isolated\r\nand barren places that are scarcely accessible or habitable, and thereby\r\nextends the inhabited area of the earth long before mere pressure of\r\npopulation would have stretched it to such limits. We find these refugee\r\nfolk living in pile villages built over the water, in deserts, in\r\nswamps, mangrove thickets, very high mountains, marshy deltas, and\r\nremote or barren islands, all which can be classified as regions of\r\nretreat. Fugitives try to place between themselves and their pursuers a\r\nbarrier of sea or desert or mountains, and in doing this have themselves\r\nsurmounted some of the greatest obstacles to the spread of the human\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nDistricts of refuge located centrally to several natural regions of\r\nmigration receive immigrants from many sides, and are therefore often\r\ncharacterized by a bizarre grouping of populations. The cluster of\r\nmarshy islands at the head of the Adriatic received fugitives from a\r\nlong semi-circle of north Italian cities during the barbarian invasions.\r\nEach refugee colony occupied a separate island, and finally all\r\ncoalesced to form the city of Venice. Central mountain districts like\r\nthe Alps and Caucasus contain \"the sweepings of the plains.\" The\r\nCaucasus particularly, on the border between Europe and Asia, contains\r\nevery physical type and representative of every linguistic family of\r\nEurasia, except pure Aryan. Nowhere else in the world probably is there\r\nsuch a heterogeneous lot of peoples, languages and religions. Ripley\r\ncalls the Caucasus \"a grave of peoples, of languages, of customs and\r\nphysical types.\"[172] Its base, north and south, and the longitudinal\r\ngroove through its center from east to west have been swept by various\r\nracial currents, which have cast up their flotsam into its valleys. The\r\npueblos of our arid Southwest, essentially an area of asylum, are\r\ninhabited by Indians of four distinct stocks, and only one of them, the\r\nMoquis, show clearly kinship to another tribe outside this\r\nterritory,[173] so that they are survivals. The twenty-eight different\r\nIndian stocks huddled together in small and diverse linguistic groups\r\nbetween the Pacific Ocean and the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada and\r\nCascade Range[174] leave the impression that these protected valleys,\r\nsimilar to the Caucasus in their ethnic diversity, were an asylum for\r\nremnants of depleted stocks who had fled to the western highlands before\r\nthe great Indian migrations of the interior.[175] Making their way\r\npainfully and at great cost of life through a region of mountain and\r\ndesert, they came out in diminished bands to survive in the protection\r\nof the great barrier. Of the twenty-one Indian linguistic stocks which\r\nhave become extinct since the arrival of the white man, fifteen belong\r\nto this transmontane strip of the Pacific slope[176]--evidence of the\r\nfragmentary character of these stocks and their consequently small power\r\nof resistance, [See map page 54.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Emigration and colonization.]\r\n\r\nAdvance to a completely sedentary life, as we see it among modern\r\ncivilized nations, prohibits the migration of whole peoples, or even of\r\nlarge groups when maintaining their political organization. On the other\r\nhand, however, sedentary life and advanced civilization bring rapid\r\nincrease of population, improved methods of communication, and an\r\nenlarged geographical horizon. These conditions encourage and facilitate\r\nemigration and colonization, forms of historical movement which have\r\ncharacterized the great commercial peoples of antiquity and the\r\novercrowded nations of modern times. These forms do not involve a whole\r\npeople, but only individuals and small groups, though in time the total\r\nresult may represent a considerable proportion of the original\r\npopulation. The United States in 1890 contained 980,938 immigrants from\r\nCanada and Newfoundland,[177] or just one-fifth the total population of\r\nthe Dominion in that same year. Germany since 1820 has contributed at\r\nleast five million citizens to non-European lands. Ireland since 1841\r\nhas seen nearly four millions of its inhabitants drawn off to other\r\ncountries,[178] an amount only little less than its present population.\r\nIt is estimated that since 1851 emigration has carried off from County\r\nClare and Kerry seventy-two per cent. of the average population; and yet\r\nthose counties are still crowded.[179] Among those who abandon their\r\nhomes in search of easier conditions of living, certain ages and certain\r\nsocial and industrial classes predominate. A typical emigrant group to\r\nAmerica represents largely the lower walks of life, includes an abnormal\r\nproportion of men and adults, and about three-fourths of it are\r\nunskilled laborers and agriculturists.[180]\r\n\r\nColonization, the most potent instrument of organized expansion, has in\r\nrecent centuries changed the relative significance of the great colonial\r\nnations of Europe. It raised England from a small insular country to the\r\ncenter of a world power. It gave sudden though temporary preëminence to\r\nSpain and Portugal, a new lease of life to little Holland, and ominous\r\nimportance to Russia. Germany, who entered the colonial field only in\r\n1880, found little desirable land left; and yet it was especially\r\nGermany who needed an outlet for her redundant population. With all\r\nthese states, as with ancient Phoenicia, Greece and Yemen, the initial\r\npurpose was commerce or in some form the exploitation of the new\r\nterritory. Colonies were originally trading stations established as safe\r\ntermini for trade routes.[181] Colonial government, as administered by\r\nthe mother country, originally had an eye single for the profits of\r\ntrade: witness the experience of the Thirteen Colonies with Great\r\nBritain. Colonial wars have largely meant the rivalry of competing\r\nnations seeking the same markets, as the history of the Portuguese and\r\nDutch in the East Indies, and the English and French in America prove.\r\nThe first Punic War had a like commercial origin--rivalry for the trade\r\nof _Magna Græcia_ between Rome and Carthage, the dominant colonial\r\npowers of the western Mediterranean. Such wars result in expansion for\r\nthe victor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Commerce.]\r\n\r\nCommerce, which so largely underlies colonization, is itself a form of\r\nhistorical movement. It both causes and stimulates great movements of\r\npeoples, yet it differs from these fundamentally in its relation to the\r\nland. Commerce traverses the land to reach its destination, but takes\r\naccount of natural features only as these affect transportation and\r\ntravel. It has to do with systems of routes and goals, which it aims to\r\nreach as quickly as possible. It reduces its cortege to essentials;\r\neliminates women and children. Therefore it surmounts natural barriers\r\nwhich block the advance of other forms of the historical movement.\r\nMerchant caravans are constantly crossing the desert, but not so\r\npeoples. Traders with loaded yaks or ponies push across the Karakorum\r\nMountains by passes where a migrating horde would starve and freeze. The\r\nnorthern limit of the Mediterranean race in Spain lies sharply defined\r\nalong the crest of the Pyrenees, whose long unbroken wall forms one of\r\nthe most pronounced boundaries in Europe;[182] yet traders and smugglers\r\nhave pushed their way through from time immemorial. Long after Etruscan\r\nmerchants had crossed northward over the Alps, Roman expansion and\r\ncolonization made a detour around the mountains westward into Gaul, with\r\nthe result that the Germans received Roman civilization not straight\r\nfrom the south, but secondhand through their Gallic neighbors west of\r\nthe Rhine.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Commerce a guide to various movements.]\r\n\r\nCommerce, though differing from other historical movements, may give to\r\nthese direction and destination. The trader is frequently the herald of\r\nsoldier and settler. He becomes their guide, takes them along the trail\r\nwhich he has blazed, and gives them his own definiteness of aim. The\r\nearliest Roman conquest of the Alpine tribes was made for the purpose of\r\nopening the passes for traders and abolishing the heavy transit duties\r\nimposed by the mountaineers.[183] Fur-traders inaugurated French\r\nexpansion to the far west of Canada, and the Russian advance into\r\nSiberia. The ancient amber route across Russia from the Baltic to the\r\nEuxine probably guided the Goths in their migration from their northern\r\nseats to the fertile lands in southern Russia, where they first appear\r\nin history as the Ostrogoths.[184] The caravan trade across the Sahara\r\nfrom the Niger to the Mediterranean coast has itself embodied an\r\nhistorical movement, by bringing out enough negro slaves appreciably to\r\nmodify the ethnic composition of the population in many parts of North\r\nAfrica.[185] It was this trade which also suggested to Prince Henry of\r\nPortugal in 1415, when campaigning in Morocco, the plan of reaching the\r\nGuinea Coast by sea and diverting its gold dust and slaves to the port\r\nof Lisbon, a movement which resulted in the Portuguese circumnavigation\r\nof Africa.[186]\r\n\r\nEvery staple place and trading station is a center of geographical\r\ninformation; it therefore gives an impulse to expansion by widening the\r\ngeographical horizon. The Lewis and Clark Expedition found the Mandan\r\nvillages at the northern bend of the Missouri River the center of a\r\ntrade which extended west to the Pacific, through the agency of the Crow\r\nand Paunch Indians of the upper Yellowstone, and far north to the\r\nAssiniboine and Saskatchewan Rivers. Here in conversation with British\r\nand French fur-traders of the Northwest Company's posts, they secured\r\ninformation about the western country they were to explore.[187]\r\nSimilarly the trade of the early Jesuit missions at La Pointe near the\r\nwest end of Lake Superior annually drew the Indians from a wide circle\r\nsweeping from Green Bay and the Fox River in the south, across the\r\nMississippi around to the Lake of the Woods and far north of Lake\r\nSuperior.[188] Here Marquette first heard of the great river destined to\r\ncarry French dominion to the Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Movements due to religion.]\r\n\r\nTrade often finds in religion an associate and coadjutor in directing\r\nand stimulating the historical movement. China regards modern Christian\r\nmissions as effective European agencies for the spread of commercial and\r\npolitical power. Jesuit and fur-trader plunged together into the wilds\r\nof colonial Canada; Spanish priest and gold-seeker into Mexico and Peru.\r\nAmerican missionary pressed close upon the heels of fur-trader into the\r\nOregon country. Jason Lee, having established a Methodist mission on the\r\nWillamette in 1834, himself experienced sudden conversion from\r\nreligionist to colonizer. He undertook a temporary mission back to the\r\nsettled States, where he preached a stirring propaganda for the\r\nsettlement and appropriation of the disputed Oregon country, before the\r\nBritish should fasten their grip upon it. The United States owes Hawaii\r\nto the expansionist spirit of American missionaries. Thirty years after\r\ntheir arrival in the islands, they held all the important offices under\r\nthe native government, and had secured valuable tracts of lands, laying\r\nthe foundation of the landed aristocracy of planters established there\r\nto-day. Their sons and grandsons took the lead in the Revolution of\r\n1893, and in the movement for annexation to the United States. Thus\r\nsometimes do the meek inherit the earth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Religious pilgrimages.]\r\n\r\nThe famous pilgrimages of the world, in which the commercial element has\r\nbeen more or less conspicuous,[189] have contributed greatly to the\r\ncirculation of peoples and ideas, especially as they involve multitudes\r\nand draw from a large circle of lands. Their economic, intellectual and\r\npolitical effects rank them as one phase of the historical movement.\r\nHerodotus tells of seven hundred thousand Egyptians flocking to the city\r\nof Bubastis from all parts of Egypt for the festival of Diana.[190] The\r\nworship of Ashtoreth in Bambyce in Syria drew votaries from all the\r\nSemitic peoples except the Jews. As early as 386 A.D. Christian\r\npilgrims flocked to Jerusalem from Armenia, Persia, India, Ethiopia, and\r\neven from Gaul and Britain. Jerusalem gave rise to those armed\r\npilgrimages, the Crusades, with all their far-reaching results. The\r\npilgrimages to Rome, which in the Jubilee of 1300 brought two hundred\r\nthousand worshipers to the sacred city, did much to consolidate papal\r\nsupremacy over Latin Christendom.[191] As the roads to Rome took the\r\npious wayfarers through Milan, Venice, Genoa, Florence, Bologna, and\r\nother great cities of Italy, they were so many channels for the\r\ndistribution of Italian art and culture over the more untutored lands of\r\nwestern Europe.\r\n\r\nThough Mecca is visited annually by only seventy or eighty thousand\r\npilgrims, it puts into motion a far greater number over the whole\r\nMohammedan world, from westernmost Africa to Chinese Turkestan.[192]\r\nYearly a great pilgrimage, numbering in 1905 eighty thousand souls,\r\nmoves across Africa eastward through the Sudan on its way to the Red Sea\r\nand Mecca. Many traders join the caravans of the devout both for\r\nprotection and profit, and the devout themselves travel with herds of\r\ncattle to trade in on the way. The merchants are prone to drop out and\r\nsettle in any attractive country, and few get beyond the populous\r\nmarkets of Wadai. The British and French governments in the Sudan aid\r\nand protect these pilgrimages; they recognize them as a political force,\r\nbecause they spread the story of the security and order of European\r\nrule.[193] The markets of western Tibet, recently opened to Indian\r\nmerchants by the British expedition to Lhassa, promote intercourse\r\nbetween the two countries especially because of the sacred lakes and\r\nmountains in their vicinity, which are goals of pilgrimage alike to\r\nHindu and Tibetan Buddhist. They offer an opportunity to acquire merit\r\nand profit at the same time, an irresistible combination to the needy,\r\npious Hindu. Therefore across the rugged passes of the Himalayas he\r\ndrives his yaks laden with English merchandise, an unconscious\r\ninstrument for the spread of English influence, English civilization and\r\nthe extension of the English market, as the Colonial Office well\r\nunderstands.[194]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Historical movement and race distribution.]\r\n\r\nThe forms which have been assumed by the historical movement are varied,\r\nbut all have contributed to the spread of man over the habitable globe.\r\nThe yellow, white and red races have become adapted to every zone; the\r\nblack race, whether in Africa, Australia or Melanesia, is confined\r\nchiefly to the Tropics. A like conservatism as to habitat tends to\r\ncharacterize all sub-races, peoples, and tribes of the human family. The\r\nfact which strikes one in studying the migrations of these smaller\r\ngroups is their adherence each to a certain zone or heat belt defined by\r\ncertain isothermal lines (see map chap. XVII.), their reluctance to\r\nprotrude beyond its limits, and the restricted range and small numerical\r\nstrength of such protrusions as occur. This seems to be the conservatism\r\nof the mature race type, which has lost some of its plasticity and shuns\r\nor succumbs to the ordeal of adaptation to contrasted climatic\r\nconditions, except when civilization enables it partially to neutralize\r\ntheir effects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRIMITIVE INDIAN STOCKS OF SOUTH AMERICA (From Helmolt's\r\n_History of the World_. By permission of Dodd, Mead & Co.)]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Migrations in relation to zones and heat belts.]\r\n\r\nIn South America, Caribs and Arawaks showed a strictly tropical\r\ndistribution from Hayti to the southern watershed of the Amazon. The\r\nTupis, moving down the Parana-La Plata system, made a short excursion\r\nbeyond the Tropic of Capricorn, though not beyond the hot belt, then\r\nturned equator-ward again along the coast.[195] In North America we find\r\nsome exceptions to the rule. For instance, though the main area of the\r\nAthapascan stock is found in the frigid belt of Canada and Alaska, north\r\nof the annual isotherm of 0°C. (32°F.) small residual fragments of\r\nthese people are scattered also along the Pacific coast of Oregon and\r\nCalifornia, marking the old line of march of a large group which drifted\r\nsouthward into Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and the northern part of\r\nMexico. The Shoshone stock, which originally occupied the Great Basin\r\nand western intermontane plateau up to the borders of Canada, sent out\r\noffshoots which developed into the ancient civilized tribes of tropical\r\nMexico and Central America. Both these emigrations to more southern\r\nzones were part of the great southward trend characterizing all\r\nmovements on the Pacific side of the continent, probably from an\r\noriginal ethnic port of entry near Bering Strait; and part also of the\r\ngeneral southward drift in search of more genial climate, which landed\r\nthe van of northern Siouan, Algonquin and Iroquoian stocks in the\r\npresent area of South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and\r\nLouisiana, while the base of their territory stretched out to its\r\ngreatest width in southern Canada and contiguous parts of the United\r\nStates. [See map page 54.][196]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ETHNOGRAPHICAL MAP OF INDIA FROM THE INDIAN CENSUS OF\r\n1901.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ETHNOGRAPHICAL MAP OF ASIA. Vertical Shading in the\r\nNorth is Slav.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Range of movements in Asia.]\r\n\r\nIf we turn to the eastern hemisphere, we find the Malays and\r\nMalayo-Polynesians, differentiated offshoots of the Mongolian stock,\r\nrestricted to the Tropics, except where Polynesians have spread to\r\noutlying New Zealand. The Chinese draw their political boundary nearly\r\nalong the Tropic of Cancer, but they have freely lapped over this\r\nfrontier into Indo-China as far as Singapore.[197] Combined with this\r\nexpansion was the early infiltration of the Chinese into the\r\nPhilippines, Borneo, and the western Sunda Isles, all distinctly\r\ntropical. The fact that the Chinese show a physical capacity for\r\nacclimatization found in no other race explains in part their presence\r\ninto the Tropics. In contrast, the Aryan folk of India, whether in their\r\npure type as found in the Punjab and Rajputana Desert, or mingled with\r\nthe earlier Dravidian races belong to the hot belt but scarcely reach\r\nthe Tropic of Cancer,[198] though their language has far overshot this\r\nline both in the Deccan and the Ganges Delta. One spore of Aryan stock,\r\nin about 450 B.C., moved by sea from the Bay of Cambay to Ceylon;\r\nmingling there with the Tamil natives, they became the progenitors of\r\nthe Singhalese, forming a hybrid tropical offshoot.\r\n\r\nEurope, except for its small sub-arctic area, has received immigrants,\r\naccording to the testimony of history and ethnology, only from the\r\ntemperate parts of Asia and Africa, with the one exception of the\r\nSaracens of Arabia, whose original home lay wholly within the hot\r\nclimate belt of 20°C. (68°F.). Saracen expansion, in covering Persia,\r\nSyria, and Egypt, still kept to this hot belt; only in the Barbary Coast\r\nof Africa and in Spain did it protrude into the temperate belt. Though\r\nthis last territory was extra-tropical, it was essentially semi-arid and\r\nsub-tropical in temperature, like the dry trade-wind belt whence the\r\nSaracens had sprung.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ETHNOGRAPHICAL MAP OF AFRICA AND ARABIA.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Range of movements in Africa.]\r\n\r\nThe Semitic folk of Arabia and the desert Hamites of northern Africa,\r\nbred by their hot, dry environment to a nomadic life, have been drawn\r\nsouthward over the Sahara across the Tropic into the grasslands of the\r\nSudan, permeating a wide zone of negro folk with the political control,\r\nreligion, civilization and blood of the Mediterranean north. Here\r\nsimilar though better conditions of life, a climate hotter though less\r\narid, attracted Hamitic invasion, while the relatively dense native\r\npopulation in a lower stage of economic development presented to the\r\ncommercial Semites the attraction of lucrative trade. South of the\r\nequator the native Bantu Kaffirs, essentially a tropical people, spread\r\nbeyond their zonal border to the south coast of Africa at 33° S.L.,\r\nand displaced the yellow Hottentots[199] before the arrival of the Dutch\r\nin 1602; while in the early nineteenth century we hear of the Makololo,\r\na division of this same Kaffir stock, leaving their native seats near\r\nthe southern sources of the Vaal River at 28° S.L. and moving some nine\r\nhundred miles northward to the Barotse territory on the upper Zambesi at\r\n15° S.L.[200] This again was a movement of a pastoral people across a\r\ntropic to other grasslands, to climatic conditions scarcely different\r\nfrom those which they had left.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Colonization and latitude.]\r\n\r\nThe modern colonial movements which have been genuine race expansions\r\nhave shown a tendency not only to adhere to their zone, but to follow\r\nparallels of latitude or isotherms. The stratification of European\r\npeoples in the Americas, excepting Spanish and Portuguese, coincides\r\nwith heat zones. Internal colonization in the United States reveals the\r\nsame principle.[201] Russian settlements in Asia stretch across Siberia\r\nchiefly between the fiftieth and fifty-fifth parallels; these same lines\r\ninclude the ancient Slav territory in Germany between the Vistula and\r\nWeser. The great efflux of home-seekers, as opposed to the smaller\r\ncontingent of mere conquerors and exploiters, which has poured forth\r\nfrom Europe since the fifteenth century, has found its destinations\r\nlargely in the temperate parts of the Americas, Australia, New Zealand,\r\nand South Africa. Even the Spanish overlords in Mexico and Peru\r\ndomiciled themselves chiefly in the highlands, where altitude in part\r\ncounteracts tropical latitude. European immigration into South America\r\nto-day greatly predominates in the temperate portions,--in Argentine,\r\nUruguay, Paraguay, southern Brazil and southern Chile. While Argentine's\r\npopulation includes over one million white foreigners, who comprise\r\ntwenty per cent. of the total,[202] Venezuela has no genuine white\r\nimmigration. Its population, which comprises only one per cent. of pure\r\nwhites, consists chiefly of negroes, mulattoes, and Sambos, hybrids of\r\nnegro and Indian race. In British Guiana, negroes and East Indian\r\ncoolies, both importations from other tropical lands, comprise\r\neighty-one per cent. of the population.[203]\r\n\r\nThe movement of Europeans into the tropical regions of Asia,\r\nAustralasia, Africa and America, like the American advance into the\r\nPhilippines, represents commercial and political, not genuine ethnic\r\nexpansion. Except where it resorts to hybridization, it seeks not new\r\nhomesteads, but the profits of tropical trade and the markets for\r\nEuropean manufactures found in retarded populations. These it secures\r\neither by a small but permanently domiciled ruling class, as formerly in\r\nSpanish and Portuguese America, or by a body of European officials,\r\nclerks, agents and soldiers, sent out for a term of years. Such are the\r\nseventy-six thousand Britishers who manage the affairs of commerce and\r\nstate in British India, and the smaller number of Dutch who perform the\r\nsame functions in the Dutch East India islands. The basis of this system\r\nis exploitation. It represents neither a high economic, ethical, nor\r\nsocial ideal, and therefore lacks the stamp of geographic finality.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Movement to like geographic conditions.]\r\n\r\nA migrating or expanding people, when free to choose, is prone to seek a\r\nnew home with like geographic conditions to the old. Hence the stamp\r\nonce given by an environment tends to perpetuate itself. All people,\r\nespecially those in the lower stages of culture, are conservative in\r\ntheir fundamental activities. Agriculture is intolerable to pastoral\r\nnomads, hunting has little attraction for a genuine fisher folk.\r\nTherefore such peoples in expansion seek an environment in which the\r\nnational aptitudes, slowly evolved in their native seats, find a ready\r\nfield. Thus arise natural provinces of distribution, whose location,\r\nclimate, physical features, and size reflect the social and economic\r\nadaptation of the inhabitants to a certain type of environment. A\r\nshepherd folk, when breaking off from its parent stock like Abraham's\r\nfamily from their Mesopotamian kinsmen, seeks a land rich in open\r\npastures and large enough to support its wasteful nomadic economy. A\r\nseafaring people absorb an ever longer strip of seaboard, like the\r\nEskimo of Arctic America, or throw out their settlements from inlet to\r\ninlet or island to island, as did Malays and Polynesians in the Pacific,\r\nancient Greeks and Phoenicians in the subtropical Mediterranean, and the\r\nNorse in the northern seas. The Dutch, bred to the national profession\r\nof diking and draining, appear in their element in the water-logged\r\ncoast of Sumatra and Guiana,[204] where they cultivate lands reclaimed\r\nfrom the sea; or as colonists in the Vistula lowlands, whither Prussia\r\nimported them to do their ancestral task, just as the English employed\r\ntheir Dutch prisoners after the wars with Holland in the seventeenth\r\ncentury to dike and drain the fens of Cambridgeshire and Lincolnshire.\r\nMoreover, the commercial talent of the Dutch, trained by their\r\nadvantageous situation on the North Sea about the Rhine mouths, guided\r\ntheir early traders to similar locations elsewhere, like the Hudson and\r\nDelaware Rivers, or planted them on islands either furnishing or\r\ncommanding extensive trade, such as Ceylon, Mauritius, the East Indies,\r\nor the Dutch holdings in the Antilles.\r\n\r\nMuch farther down in the cultural scale we find the fisher tribes of\r\nCentral Africa extending their villages from point to point along the\r\nequatorial streams, and the river Indians of South America gradually\r\nspreading from headwaters to estuary, and thence to the related\r\nenvironment of the coast. The Tupis, essentially a water race, have left\r\ntraces of their occupation only where river or coast enabled them to\r\nlive by their inherited aptitudes.[205] The distribution of the ancient\r\nmounds in North America shows their builders to have sought with few\r\nexceptions protected sites near alluvial lowlands, commanding rich soil\r\nfor cultivation and the fish supply from the nearby river. Mountaineer\r\nfolk often move from one upland district to another, as did the Lombards\r\nof Alpine Pannonia in their conquest of Lombardy and Apennine Italy,\r\nwhere all their four duchies were restricted to the highlands of the\r\npeninsula.[206] The conquests of the ancient Incas and the spread of\r\ntheir race covered one Andean valley after another for a stretch of one\r\nthousand five hundred miles, wherever climatic and physical conditions\r\nwere favorable to their irrigated tillage and highland herds of llamas.\r\nThey found it easier to climb pass after pass and mount to ever higher\r\naltitudes, rather than descend to the suffocating coasts where neither\r\nman nor beast could long survive, though they pushed the political\r\nboundary finally to the seaboard. [Map page 101.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Movement to better geographic conditions.]\r\n\r\nThe search for better land, milder climate, and easier conditions of\r\nliving starts many a movement of peoples which, in view of their\r\npurpose, necessarily leads them into an environment sharply contrasted\r\nto their original habitat. Such has been the radial outflow of the\r\nMongoloid tribes down from the rugged highlands of central Asia to the\r\nfertile river lowlands of the peripheral lands; the descent of the Iran\r\npastors upon the agricultural folk of the Indus, Ganges and Mesopotamian\r\nvalleys, and the swoop of desert-born conquerors upon the unresisting\r\ntillers of well-watered fields in all times, from the ancient Hyksos of\r\nthe Nile to the modern Fulbe of the Niger Valley.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Southward and westward drifts in the northern hemisphere.]\r\n\r\nThe attraction of a milder climate has caused in the northern hemisphere\r\na constantly recurring migration from north to south. In primitive North\r\nAmerica, along the whole broad Atlantic slope, the predominant direction\r\nof Indian migrations was from north to south, accompanied by a drift\r\nfrom west to east.[207] On the Pacific side of the continent also the\r\ntrend was southward. This is generally conceded regardless of theory as\r\nto whether the Indians first found entrance to the continent at its\r\nnortheast or northwest corner. It was a movement toward milder\r\nclimates.[208] Study of the _Völkerwanderungen_ in Europe reveals two\r\ncurrents or drifts in varied combination, one from north to south and\r\nthe other from east to west, but both of them aimed at regions of better\r\nclimate; for the milder temperature and more abundant rainfall of\r\nwestern Europe made a country as alluring to the Goths, Huns, Alans,\r\nSlavs, Bulgars and Tartars of Asiatic deserts and Russian steppes, as\r\nwere the sunny Mediterranean peninsulas to the dwellers of the bleak\r\nBaltic coasts. This is one geographic fact back of the conspicuous\r\nwestward movement formulated into an historical principle: \"Westward the\r\nstar of empire takes its course.\" The establishment of European colonies\r\non the western side of the Atlantic, their extension thence to the\r\nPacific and ever westward, till European culture was transplanted to the\r\nPhilippines by Spain and more recently by the United States, constitute\r\nthe most remarkable sustained movement made by any one race.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Eastward movements.]\r\n\r\nBut westward movements are not the only ones. On the Pacific slope of\r\nAsia the star has moved eastward. From highland Mongolia issued the\r\nthrong which originally populated the lowlands of China; and ever\r\nsince, one nomad conqueror after the other has descended thence to rule\r\nthe fruitful plains of Chili and the teeming populations of the Yangtze\r\nValley.[209] Russia, blocked in its hoped for expansion to the west by\r\nthe strong powers of central Europe, stretched its dominion eastward to\r\nthe Pacific and for a short time over to Alaska. The chief expansion of\r\nthe German people and the German Empire in historical times has also\r\nbeen from west to east; but this eastward advance is probably only\r\nretracing the steps taken by many primitive Teutonic tribes as they\r\ndrifted Rhineward from an earlier habitat along the Vistula.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Return movements.]\r\n\r\nSince the world is small, it frequently happens that a people after an\r\ninterval of generations, armed with a higher civilization, will reënter\r\na region which it once left when too crude and untutored to develop the\r\npossibilities of the land, but which its better equipment later enables\r\nit to exploit. Thus we find a backward expansion of the Chinese westward\r\nto the foot of the Pamir, and an internal colonization of the empire to\r\nthe Ili feeder of Lake Balkash. The expansion of the Japanese into Korea\r\nand Saghalin is undoubtedly such a return current, after an interval\r\nlong enough to work a complete transformation in the primitive\r\nMongolians who found their way to that island home. Sometimes the return\r\nrepresents the ebbing of the tide, rather than the back water of a\r\nstream in flood. Such was the retreat of the Moors from Spain to the\r\nBerber districts of North Africa, whither they carried echoes of the\r\nbrilliant Saracen civilization in the Iberian Peninsula. Such has been\r\nthe gradual withdrawal of the Turks from Europe back to their native\r\nAsia, and slow expulsion of the Tartar tribes from Russia to the barren\r\nAsiatic limits of their former territory. [See map page 225.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Regions of attraction and repulsion.]\r\n\r\nVoluntary historical movements, seeking congenial or choice regions of\r\nthe earth, have left its less favored spots undisturbed. Paucity of\r\nresources and isolation have generally insured to a region a peaceful\r\nhistory; natural wealth has always brought the conqueror. In ancient\r\nGreece the fruitful plains of Thessaly, Boeotia, Elis and Laconia had a\r\nfatal attraction for every migrating horde; Attica's rugged surface,\r\npoor soil, and side-tracked location off the main line of travel\r\nbetween Hellas and the Peloponnesus saved it from many a rough\r\nvisitant,[210] and hence left the Athenians, according to Thucydides, an\r\nindigenous race. The fertility of the Rhine Valley has always attracted\r\ninvasion, the barren Black Forest range has repelled and obstructed it.\r\n\r\nThe security of such unproductive highlands lies more in their failure\r\nto attract than in their power to resist conquest. When to abundant\r\nnatural resources, a single spot adds a reputation for wealth,\r\nmagnificence, an exceptional position for the control of territory or\r\ncommerce, it becomes a geographical magnet. Such was Delphi for the\r\nGauls of the Balkan Peninsula in the third century, Rome for the\r\nGermanic and Hunnish tribes of the _Völkerwanderung_, Constantinople for\r\nthe Normans, Turks and Russians, Venice for land-locked Austria, the\r\nMississippi highway and the outlet at New Orleans for our\r\nTrans-Allegheny pioneers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Psychical influences in certain movements.]\r\n\r\nSometimes the goal is fabulous or mythical, but potent to lure, like the\r\nland of El Dorado, abounding in gold and jewels, which for two centuries\r\nspurred on Spanish exploration in America. Other than purely material\r\nmotives may initiate or maintain such a movement, an ideal or a dream of\r\ngood, like the fountain of eternal youth which brought Ponce de Leon to\r\nFlorida, the search for the Islands of the Blessed, or the spirit of\r\nreligious propaganda which stimulated the spread of the Spanish in\r\nMexico and the French in Canada, or the hope of religious toleration\r\nwhich has drawn Quaker, Puritan, Huguenot, and Jew to America. It was an\r\nidea of purely spiritual import which directed the century-long movement\r\nof the Crusades toward Jerusalem, half Latinized the Levant, and widened\r\nthe intellectual horizon of Europe. A national or racial sentiment which\r\nenhaloes a certain spot may be pregnant with historical results, because\r\nat any moment it may start some band of enthusiasts on a path of\r\nmigration or conquest. The Zionist agitation for the return of oppressed\r\nJews to Palestine, and the establishment of the Liberian Republic for\r\nthe negroes in Africa rest upon such a sentiment. The reverence of the\r\nChristian world for Rome as a goal of pilgrimages materially enhanced\r\nthe influence of Italy as a school of culture during the Middle Ages.\r\nThe spiritual and ethnic association of the Mohammedan world with Mecca\r\nis always fraught with possible political results. The dominant tribes\r\nof the Sudan, followers of Islam, who proudly trace back a fictitious\r\nline of ancestry to the Arabs of Yemen, are readily incited to support a\r\nnew prophet sprung from the race of Mecca.[211] The pilgrimages which the\r\nBuddhists of the Asiatic highlands make to the sacred city of Lhassa\r\nensure China's control over the restless nomads through the\r\ninstrumentality of the Grand Lama of Tibet.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Results of historical movement.]\r\n\r\nHistorical movements are varied as to motive, direction, numerical\r\nstrength, and character, but their final results are two,\r\ndifferentiation and assimilation. Both are important phases of the\r\nprocess of evolution, but the latter gains force with the progress of\r\nhistory and the increase of the world's population.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Differentiation and area.]\r\n\r\nA people or race which, in its process of numerical growth, spreads over\r\na large territory subjects itself to a widening range of geographic\r\nconditions, and therefore of differentiation. The broad expansion of the\r\nTeutonic race in Europe, America, Australia and South Africa has brought\r\nit into every variety of habitat. If the territory has a monotonous\r\nrelief like Russia, nevertheless, its mere extent involves diversity of\r\nclimate and location. The diversity of climate incident to large area\r\ninvolves in turn different animal and plant life, different crops,\r\ndifferent economic activities. Even in lowlands the relief, geologic\r\nstructure, and soil are prone to vary over wide districts. The\r\nmonotonous surface of Holland shows such contrasts. So do the North\r\nGerman lowlands; here the sandy barren flats of the \"geest\" alternate\r\nwith stretches of fertile silt deposited by the rivers or the sea,[212]\r\nand support different types of communities, which have been admirably\r\ndescribed by Gustav Frenssen in his great novel of Jön Uhl. The flat\r\nsurface of southern Illinois shows in small compass the teeming\r\nfertility of the famous \"American bottom,\" the poor clay soil of \"Egypt\"\r\nwith its backward population, and the rich prairie land just to the\r\nnorth with its prosperous and progressive farmer class.\r\n\r\nWhen the relief includes mountains, the character not only of the land\r\nbut of the climate changes, and therewith the type of community. Hence\r\nneighboring districts may produce strongly contrasted types of society.\r\nMadison County of Kentucky, lying on the eastern margin of the Bluegrass\r\nregion, contains the rich landed estates, negro laboring class and\r\naristocratic society characteristic of the \"planter\" communities of the\r\nold South; and only twenty miles southeast of Richmond, the center of\r\nthis wealth and refinement, it includes also the rough barren hill\r\ncountry of the Cumberland Plateau, where are found one-room cabins,\r\nmoonshine stills, feuds, and a backward population sprung from the same\r\npure English stock as the Bluegrass people.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Contrasted environments.]\r\n\r\nHere is differentiation due to the immediate influences of environment.\r\nThe phenomenon reappears in every part of the world, in every race and\r\nevery age. The contrast between the ancient Greeks of the mountains,\r\ncoasts and alluvial valleys shows the power of environment to direct\r\neconomic activities and to modify culture and social organization. So\r\ndoes the differences between the coast, steppe, and forest Indians of\r\nGuiana,[213] the Kirghis of the Pamir pastures and the Irtysh River\r\nvalley, the agricultural Berbers of the Atlas Mountains and the Berber\r\nnomads of the Sahara, the Swiss of the high, lonely Engadine and those\r\nof the crowded Aar valley.\r\n\r\nContrasted environments effect a natural selection in another way and\r\nthereby greatly stimulate differentiation, whenever an intruding people\r\ncontest the ownership of the territory with the inhabitants. The\r\nstruggle for land means a struggle also for the best land, which\r\ntherefore falls to the share of the strongest peoples. Weaklings must\r\ncontent themselves with poor soils, inaccessible regions of mountain,\r\nswamp or desert. There they deteriorate, or at best strike a slower pace\r\nof increase or progress. The difference between the people of the\r\nhighlands and plains of Great Britain or of France is therefore in part\r\na distinction of race due to this geographical selection,[214] in part a\r\ndistinction of economic development and culture due to geographic\r\ninfluences. Therefore the piedmont belts of the world, except in arid\r\nlands, are cultural, ethnic and often political lines of cleavage,\r\nshowing marked differentiation on either side. Isotherms are other such\r\ncleavage lines, marking the limits beyond which an aggressive people did\r\nnot desire to expand because of an uncongenial climate. The distinction\r\nbetween Anglo-Saxon and Latin America is one of zone as well as race.\r\nEverywhere in North America the English stock has dominated or displaced\r\nFrench and Spanish competitors down to the Mexican frontier.\r\n\r\nAs the great process of European colonization has permeated the earth\r\nand multiplied its population, not only the best land but the amount of\r\nthis has commenced to differentiate the history of various European\r\nnations, and that in a way whose end cannot yet be definitely predicted.\r\nThe best lands have fallen to the first-comers strong enough to hold\r\nthem. People who early develop powers of expansion, like the English, or\r\nwho, like the French and Russians, formulate and execute vast\r\nterritorial policies, secure for their future growth a wide base which\r\nwill for all time distinguish them from late-comers into the colonial\r\nfield, like Germany and Italy. These countries see the fecundity of\r\ntheir people redounding to the benefit of alien colonial lands, which\r\nhave been acquired by enterprising rivals in the choice sections of the\r\ntemperate zone. German and Italian colonies in torrid, unhealthy, or\r\nbarren tropical lands, fail to attract emigrants from the mother\r\ncountry, and therefore to enhance national growth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Two-type populations.]\r\n\r\nWhen colonizers or conquerors appropriate the land of a lower race, we\r\nfind a territory occupied at least for a time by two types of\r\npopulation, constituting an ethnic, social and often economic\r\ndifferentiation. The separation may be made geographical also. The\r\nIndians in the United States have been confined to reservations, like\r\nthe Hottentots to the twenty or more \"locations\" in Cape Colony. This is\r\nthe simplest arrangement. Whether the second or lower type survives\r\ndepends upon their economic and social utility, into which again\r\ngeographic conditions enter. The Indians of Canada are a distinct\r\neconomic factor in that country as trappers for the Hudson Bay Company,\r\nand they will so remain till the hunting grounds of the far north are\r\nexhausted. The native agriculturists in the Tropics are indispensable to\r\nthe unacclimated whites. The negroes of the South, introduced for an\r\neconomic purpose, find their natural habitat in the Black Belt. Here we\r\nhave an ethnic division of labor for geographical reasons. Castes or\r\nsocial classes, often distinguished by shades of color as in Brahman\r\nIndia, survive as differentiations indicating old lines of race\r\ncleavage. There is abundant evidence that the upper classes in Germany,\r\nFrance, Austria, and the British Isles are distinctly lighter of hair\r\nand eyes than the peasantry.[215] The high-class Japanese are taller and\r\nfairer than the masses. Nearly all the African tribes of the Sudan and\r\nbordering Sahara include two distinct classes, one of lighter and one of\r\ndarker shade. Many Fulbe tribes distinguish these classes by the names\r\nof \"Blacks\" and \"Whites.\"[216] The two-type people are the result of\r\nhistorical movements.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Differentiation and isolation.]\r\n\r\nDifferentiation results not only from contrasted geographic conditions,\r\nbut also from segregation. A moving or expanding throng in search of\r\nmore and better lands drops off one group to occupy a fertile valley or\r\nplain, while the main body goes on its way, till it reaches a\r\nsatisfactory destination or destinations. The tendency to split and\r\ndivide, characteristic of primitive peoples, is thus stimulated by\r\nmigration and expansion. Each offshoot, detached from the main body,\r\ntends to diverge from the stock type. If it reaches a naturally isolated\r\nregion, where its contact without is practically cut off, it grows from\r\nits own loins, emphasizes its group characteristic by close in-breeding,\r\nand tends to show a development related to biological divergence under\r\nconditions of isolation. Since man is essentially a gregarious animal,\r\nthe size of every such migrating band will always prevent the evolution\r\nof any sharply defined variety, according to the standard of biology.\r\nNevertheless, the divergent types of men and societies developed in\r\nsegregated regions are an echo of the formation of new species under\r\nconditions of isolation which is now generally acknowledged by\r\nbiological science. Isolation was recognized by Darwin as an occasional\r\nfactor in the origin of species and especially of divergence; in\r\ncombination with migration it was made the basis of a theory of\r\nevolution by Moritz Wagner in 1873;[217] and in recent years has come to\r\nbe regarded as an essential in the explanation of divergence of types,\r\nas opposed to differentiation.[218]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Differentiation and digression.]\r\n\r\nThe traditions of the Delaware Indians and Sioux in the north of the\r\nUnited States territory, and of the Creeks in the south, commence with\r\neach stock group as a united body, which, as it migrates, splits into\r\ntribes and sends out offshoots developing different dialects. Here was\r\ntribal differentiation after entry into the general stock area, the\r\nprocess going on during migration as well as after the tribes had become\r\nestablished in their respective habitats. Culture, however, made little\r\nprogress till after they became sedentary and took up agriculture to\r\nsupplement the chase.[219] Tribes sometimes wander far beyond the limits\r\nof their stock, like the Iroquoian Cherokees of East Tennessee and North\r\nCarolina or the Athapascan Navajos and Apaches of arid New Mexico and\r\nArizona, who had placed twenty or thirty degrees of latitude between\r\nthemselves and their brethren in the basins of the Yukon and Mackenzie\r\nrivers. Such inevitably come into contrasted climatic conditions, which\r\nfurther modify the immigrants. [See map page 54.]\r\n\r\nWide digressions differentiate them still further from the parent stock\r\nby landing them amid different ethnic and social groups, by contact with\r\nwhom they are inevitably modified. The Namaqua Hottentots, living on the\r\nsouthern margin of the Hottentot country near the frontier of the\r\nEuropean settlements in Cape Colony, acquired some elements of\r\ncivilization, together with a strain of Boer and English blood, and in\r\nsome cases even the Dutch vernacular. They were therefore differentiated\r\nfrom their nomadic and warlike kinsmen in the grasslands north of the\r\nOrange River, which formed the center of the Hottentot area.[220] A view\r\nof the ancient Germans during the first five or six centuries after\r\nChrist reveals differentiation by various contacts in process along all\r\nthe ragged borders of the Germanic area. The offshoots who pushed\r\nwestward across the Rhine into Belgian Gaul were rapidly Celticized,\r\nabandoning their semi-nomadic life for sedentary agriculture,\r\nassimilating the superior civilization which they found there, and\r\nsteadily merging with the native population. They became _Belgae_,\r\nthough still conscious of their Teutonic origin.[221] The Batavians, an\r\noffshoot of the ancient Chatti living near the Thuringian Forest,\r\nappropriated the river island between the Rhine and the Waal. There in\r\nthe seclusion of their swamps, they became a distinct national unit,\r\nretaining their backward German culture and primitive type of German\r\nspeech, which the Chatti themselves lost by contact with the High\r\nGermans.[222] Far away on the southeastern margin of the Teutonic area\r\nthe same process of assimilation to a foreign civilization went on a\r\nlittle later when the Visigoths, after a century of residence on the\r\nlower Danube in contact with the Eastern Empire, adopted the Arian form\r\nof Christianity which had arisen in the Greek peninsula.[223] The border\r\nregions of the world show the typical results of the historical\r\nmovement--differentiation from the core or central group through\r\nassimilation to a new group which meets and blends with it along the\r\nfrontier.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Geographic conditions of heterogeneity and homogeneity.]\r\n\r\nEntrance into a naturally isolated district, from which subsequent\r\nincursions are debarred, gives conditions for divergence and the\r\ncreation of a new type. On the other hand, where few physical barriers\r\nare present to form these natural pockets, the process of assimilation\r\ngoes on over a wide field. Europe is peculiar among the family of\r\ncontinents for its \"much divided\" geography, commented upon by Strabo.\r\nHence its islands, peninsulas and mountain-rimmed basins have produced a\r\nvariegated assemblage of peoples, languages and culture. Only where it\r\nruns off into the monotonous immensity of Russia do we find a people who\r\nin their physical traits, language, and civilization reflect the\r\nuniformity of their environment.[224]\r\n\r\nAfrica's smooth outline, its plateau surface rimmed with mountains which\r\nenclose but fail to divide, and its monotonous configuration have\r\nproduced a racial and cultural uniformity as striking as Europe's\r\nheterogeneity. Constant movements and commixture, migration and\r\nconquest, have been the history of the black races, varied by victorious\r\nincursions of the Hamitic and Semitic whites from the north, which,\r\nhowever, have resulted in the amalgamation of the two races after\r\nconquest.[225] Constant fusion has leveled also the social and political\r\nrelations of the people to one type; it has eliminated primordial\r\ngroups, except where the dwarf hunters have taken refuge in the\r\nequatorial forests and the Bushmen in the southwestern deserts, just as\r\nit has thwarted the development of higher social groups by failure to\r\nsegregate and protect. It has sown the Bantu speech broadcast over the\r\nimmense area of Central Africa, and is disseminating the Hausa language\r\nthrough the agency of a highly mixed commercial folk over a wide tract\r\nof the western Sudan. The long east-and-west stretch of the Sudan\r\ngrasslands presents an unobstructed zone between the thousand-mile belt\r\nof desert to the north and the dense equatorial forests to the south,\r\nbetween hunger and thirst on one side, heat and fever and impenetrable\r\nforests on the other. Hence the Sudan in all history has been the\r\ncrowded Broadway of Africa. Here pass commercial caravans, hybrid\r\nmerchant tribes like the Hausa, throngs of pilgrims, streams of peoples,\r\nherds of cattle moving to busy markets, rude incursive shoppers or\r\nlooters from the desert, coming to buy or rob or rule in this highway\r\nbelt. [See map page 105.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Differentiation versus assimilation.]\r\n\r\nHistorical development advances by means of differentiation and\r\nassimilation. A change of environment stimulates variation. Primitive\r\nculture is loath to change; its inertia is deep-seated. Only a sharp\r\nprod will start it moving or accelerate its speed; such a prod is found\r\nin new geographic conditions or new social contacts. Divergence in a\r\nsegregated spot may be overdone. Progress crawls among a people too long\r\nisolated, though incipient civilization thrives for a time in seclusion.\r\nBut in general, accessibility, exposure to some measure of ethnic\r\namalgamation and social contact is essential to sustained progress.[226]\r\nAs the world has become more closely populated and means of\r\ncommunication have improved, geographical segregation is increasingly\r\nrare. The earth has lost its \"corners.\" All parts are being drawn into\r\nthe circle of intercourse. Therefore differentiation, the first effect\r\nof the historical movement, abates; the second effect, assimilation,\r\ntakes the lead.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Elimination by historical movement.]\r\n\r\nThe ceaseless human movements making for new combinations have\r\nstimulated development. They have lifted the level of culture, and\r\nworked towards homogeneity of race and civilization on a higher plane.\r\nSince the period of the great discoveries inaugurated by Columbus\r\nenabled the historical movement to compass the world, whole continents,\r\nlike North America and Australia, have been reclaimed to civilization by\r\ncolonization. The process of assimilation is often ruthless in its\r\nmethod. Hence it has been attended by a marked reduction in the number\r\nof different ethnic stocks, tribes, languages, dialects, social and\r\ncultural types through wide-spread elimination of the weak, backward or\r\nunfit.[227] These have been wiped out, either by extermination or the\r\nslower process of absorption. The Indian linguistic stocks in the United\r\nStates have been reduced from fifty-three to thirty-two; and of those\r\nthirty-two, many survive as a single tribe or the shrinking remnant of\r\none.[228] In Africa the slave trade has caused the annihilation of many\r\nsmall tribes.[229] The history of the Hottentots, who have been passive\r\nbefore the active advance of the English, Dutch and Kaffirs about them,\r\nshows a race undergoing a widespread process of hybridization[230] and\r\nextermination.[231]\r\n\r\nStrong peoples, like the English, French, Russians and Chinese, occupy\r\never larger areas. Where an adverse climate precludes genuine\r\ncolonization, as it did for the Spanish in Central and South America,\r\nand for the English and Dutch in the Indies, they make their\r\ncivilization, if not their race, permeate the acquired territory, and\r\ngradually impose on it their language and economic methods. The Poles,\r\nwho once boasted a large and distinguished nationality, are being\r\nGermanized and Russified to their final national extinction. The Finns,\r\nwhose Scandinavian offshoot has been almost absorbed in Sweden,[232] are\r\nbeing forcibly dissolved in the Muscovite dominion by powerful reägents,\r\nby Russian schoolmasters, a Russian priesthood, Russian military\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: No new ethnic types.]\r\n\r\nNo new types of races have been developed either by amalgamation or by\r\ntransfer to new climatic and economic conditions in historic times.\r\nContrasted geographic conditions long ago lost their power to work\r\nradical physical changes in the race type, because man even with the\r\nbeginnings of civilization learned to protect himself against extremes\r\nof climate. He therefore preserved his race type, which consequently in\r\nthe course of ages lost much of its plasticity and therewith its\r\ncapacity to evolve new varieties.[233] Where ethnic amalgamations on a\r\nlarge scale have occurred as a result of the historical movement, as in\r\nMexico, the Sudan and Central Africa, the local race, being numerically\r\nstronger than the intruders and better adapted to the environment, has\r\nsucceeded in maintaining its type, though slightly modified, side by\r\nside with the intruders. The great historical movements of modern times,\r\nhowever, have been the expansion of European peoples over the retarded\r\nregions of the world. These peoples, coming into contact with inferior\r\nraces, and armed generally with a race pride which was antagonistic to\r\nhybrid marriages, preserved their blood from extensive intermixture.\r\nHybridism, where it existed, was an ephemeral feature restricted to\r\npioneer days, when white women were scarce, or to regions of extreme\r\nheat or cold, where white women and children could with difficulty\r\nsurvive. Even in Spanish America, where ethnic blendings were most\r\nextensive, something of the old Spanish pride of race has reasserted\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Checks to differentiation.]\r\n\r\nImproved communication maintains or increases the ranks of the intruders\r\nfrom the home supply. The negroes in North America, imported as they\r\nwere _en masse_, then steadily recruited by two centuries of the slave\r\ntrade, while their race integrity was somewhat protected by social\r\nostracism, have not been seriously modified physically by several\r\ngenerations of residence in a temperate land. Their changes have been\r\nchiefly cultural. The Englishman has altered only superficially in the\r\nvarious British colonial lands. Constant intercourse and the progress of\r\ninventions have enabled him to maintain in diverse regions approximate\r\nuniformity of physical well-being, similar social and political ideals.\r\nThe changed environment modifies him in details of thought, manner, and\r\nspeech, but not in fundamentals.\r\n\r\nMoreover, civilized man spreading everywhere and turning all parts of\r\nthe earth's surface to his uses, has succeeded to some extent in\r\nreducing its physical differences. The earth as modified by human action\r\nis a conspicuous fact of historical development.[234] Irrigation,\r\ndrainage, fertilization of soils, terrace agriculture, denudation of\r\nforests and forestration of prairies have all combined to diminish the\r\ncontrasts between diverse environments, while the acclimatization of\r\nplants, animals and men works even more plainly to the same end of\r\nuniformity. The unity of the human race, varied only by superficial\r\ndifferences, reflects the unity of the spherical earth, whose\r\ndiversities of geographical feature nowhere depart greatly from the mean\r\nexcept in point of climate. Differentiation due to geography, therefore,\r\nearly reached its limits. For assimilation no limit can be forseen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Geographical origins.]\r\n\r\nIn view of this constant differentiation on the one hand, and\r\nassimilation on the other, the historical movement has made it difficult\r\nto trace race types to their origin; and yet this is a task in which\r\ngeography must have a hand. Borrowed civilizations and purloined\r\nlanguages are often so many disguises which conceal the truth of ethnic\r\nrelationships. A long migration to a radically different habitat, into\r\nan outskirt or detached location protected from the swamping effects of\r\ncross-breeding, results eventually in a divergence great enough to\r\nobliterate almost every cue to the ancient kinship. The long-headed\r\nTeutonic race of northern Europe is regarded now by ethnologists as an\r\noffshoot of the long-headed brunette Mediterranean race of African\r\norigin, which became bleached out under the pale suns of Scandinavian\r\nskies. The present distribution of the various Teutonic stocks is a\r\ngeographical fact; their supposed cradle in the Mediterranean basin is a\r\ngeographical hypothesis. The connecting links must also be geographical.\r\nThey must prove the former presence of the migrating folk in the\r\nintervening territory. A dolichocephalic substratum of population, with\r\na negroid type of skull, has in fact been traced by archaeologists all\r\nover Europe through the early and late Stone Ages. The remains of these\r\naboriginal inhabitants are marked in France, even in sparsely tenanted\r\ndistricts like the Auvergne Plateau, which is now occupied by the\r\nbroad-headed Alpine race; and they are found to underlie, in point of\r\ntime, other brachycephalic areas, like the Po Valley, Bavaria and\r\nRussia.[235]\r\n\r\nThe origin of a people can be investigated and stated only in terms of\r\ngeography. The problem of origin can be solved only by tracing a people\r\nfrom its present habitat, through the country over which it has\r\nmigrated, back to its original seat. Here are three geographical\r\nentities which can be laid down upon a map, though seldom with sharply\r\ndefined boundaries. They represent three successive geographic\r\nlocations, all embodying geographic conditions potent to influence the\r\npeople and their movement. Hence the geographical element emerges in\r\nevery investigation as to origins; whether in ethnology, history,\r\nphilology, mythology or religion. The transit land, the course between\r\nstart and finish, is of supreme importance. Especially is this true for\r\nreligion, which is transformed by travel. Christianity did not conquer\r\nthe world in the form in which it issued from the cramped and isolated\r\nenvironment of Palestine, but only after it had been remodelled in Asia\r\nMinor, Egypt, Greece and Rome, and cosmopolized in the wide contact of\r\nthe Mediterranean basin. The Roman speech and civilization, which spread\r\nthrough the Romance speaking peoples of Europe, were variously diluted\r\nand alloyed before being transplanted by French, Spaniard and Portuguese\r\nto American shores, there to be further transformed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Large centers of dispersion.]\r\n\r\nIn view of the countless springs and tributaries that combine to swell\r\nthe current of every historical movement, anthropo-geography looks for\r\nthe origin of a people not in a narrowly defined area, but in a broad,\r\nill-defined center of dispersion, from which many streams simultaneously\r\nand successively flow out as from a low-rimmed basin, and which has been\r\nfilled from many remoter sources. Autochthones, aborigines are therefore\r\nmerely scientific tropes, indicating the limit beyond which the movement\r\nof people cannot be traced in the gray light of an uncertain dawn. The\r\nvaguer and more complex these movements on account of their historical\r\nremoteness, the wider their probable range. The question as to the\r\ngeographical origin of the Aryan linguistic family of peoples brings us\r\nto speculative sources, more or less scientifically based, reaching from\r\nScandinavia and Lithuania to the Hindu Kush Mountains and northern\r\nAfrica.[236] The sum total of all these conjectural cradles, amounting\r\nto a large geographical area, would more nearly approximate the truth as\r\nto Aryan origins. For the study of the historical movement makes it\r\nclear that a large, highly differentiated ethnic or linguistic family\r\npresupposes a big center end a long period of dispersion, protracted\r\nwanderings, and a diversified area both for their migrations and\r\nsuccessive settlements.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Small centers.]\r\n\r\nThe slighter the inner differences in an ethnic stock, whether in\r\nculture, language or physical traits, the smaller was their center of\r\ndistribution and the more rapid their dispersal. The small initial\r\nhabitat restricts the chances of variation through isolation and\r\ncontrasted geographic conditions, as does also the short duration of\r\ntheir subsequent separation. The amazing uniformity of the Eskimo type\r\nfrom Bering Strait to eastern Greenland can only thus be explained, even\r\nafter making allowance for the monotony of their geographic conditions\r\nand remoteness from outside influences. The distribution of the Bantu\r\ndialects over so wide a region in Central Africa and with such slight\r\ndivergences presupposes narrow limits both of space and time for their\r\norigin, and a short period since their dispersal.[237]\r\n\r\nSmall centers of dispersion are generally natural districts with fixed\r\nboundaries, favored by their geographical location or natural resources\r\nor by both for the development of a relatively dense population. When\r\nthis increases beyond the local limits of subsistence, there follows an\r\nemigration in point of number and duration out of all proportion to the\r\nsmall area whence it issues. Ancient Phoenicia, Crete, Samos, mediæval\r\nNorway, Venice, Yemen, modern Malta, Gilbert Islands, England and Japan\r\nfurnish examples. Such small favored areas, when they embody also strong\r\npolitical power, may get the start in the occupation of colonial lands.\r\nThis gives them a permanent advantage, if their colonies are chosen with\r\na view to settlement in congenial climates, as were those of the\r\nEnglish, rather than the more ephemeral advantage of trade, as were\r\nthose of the Dutch and Portuguese in the Tropics. It seems also\r\nessential to these centers of dispersion, that, to be effective, they\r\nmust command the wide choice of outlet and destination afforded by the\r\nmighty common of the sea. Only the Inca Empire in South America gives\r\nus an example of the extensive political expansion of a small mountain\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tests of origin.]\r\n\r\nThe question arises whether any single rule can as yet be formulated for\r\nidentifying the original seats of existing peoples. By some ethnologists\r\nand historians such homes have been sought where the people are\r\ndistributed in the largest area, as the Athapascan and Algonquin Indians\r\nare assigned to a northern source, because their territories attained\r\ntheir greatest continuous extent in Canada, but were intermittent or\r\nattenuated farther south. The fact that colonial peoples often multiply\r\ninordinately in new lands, and there occupy a territory vastly greater\r\nthan that of the mother country, points to the danger in such a\r\ngeneralization. Of the ten millions of Jews in the world, only a handful\r\nremain in the ancient center of dispersion in Palestine, while about\r\neight millions are found in Poland and the contiguous territories of\r\nwestern Russia, Roumania, Austria-Hungary and eastern Germany. Moreover,\r\nhistory and the German element in the \"Yiddish\" speech of the Russian\r\nJews point to a secondary center of dispersion in the Rhine cities and\r\nFranconia, whither the Jews were drawn by the trade route up the Rhone\r\nValley in the third century.[238]\r\n\r\nA more scientific procedure is to look for the early home of a race in\r\nthe locality around which its people or family of peoples centers in\r\nmodern times. Therefore we place the cradle of the negro race in Africa,\r\nrather than Melanesia. Density often supplies a test, because colonial\r\nlands are generally more sparsely inhabited than the mother country. But\r\neven this conclusion fails always to apply, as in the case of Samos,\r\nwhich has a population vastly more dense than any section of the Grecian\r\nmainland. The largest compact area including at once the greatest\r\ndensity of population and the greatest purity of race would more nearly\r\nindicate the center of dispersion; because purity of race is\r\nincompatible with long migrations, as we have seen, though in the native\r\nseat it may be affected by intrusive elements. When this purity of race\r\nis combined with archaic forms of language and culture, as among the\r\nLithuanians of Aryan speech among the Baltic swamps, it may indicate\r\nthat the locality formed a segregated corner of the early center of\r\ndispersion. It seems essential to such an original seat that, whether\r\nlarge or small, it should be marked by some degree of isolation, as the\r\ncondition for the development of specific racial characteristics.\r\n\r\nThe complexity of this question of ethnic origins is typical of\r\nanthropo-geographic problems, typical also in the warning which it gives\r\nagainst any rigidly systematic method of solution. The whole science of\r\nanthropo-geography is as yet too young for hard-and-fast rules, and its\r\nsubject matter too complex for formulas.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n[126] H.J.

It outweighs every other single geographic force.\r\nAll that has been said of Russia's vast area, of her steppes and tundra\r\nwastes, of her impotent seaboard on land-locked basins or ice-bound\r\ncoasts, of her poverty of mountains and wealth of rivers, fades into the\r\nbackground before her location on the border of Asia. From her defeat by\r\nthe Tartar hordes in 1224 to her attack upon the Mongolian rulers of the\r\nBosporus in 1877, and her recent struggle with Japan, most of her wars\r\nhave been waged against Asiatics. Location made her the bulwark of\r\nCentral Europe against Asiatic invasion and the apostle of Western\r\ncivilization to the heart of Asia. If this position on the outskirts of\r\nEurope, remote from its great centers of development, has made Russia\r\nonly partially accessible to European culture and, furthermore, has\r\nsubjected her to the retarding ethnic and social influences emanating\r\nfrom her Asiatic neighbors,[239] and if the rough tasks imposed by her\r\nfrontier situation have hampered her progress, these are all the\r\nlimitations of her geographical location, limitations which not even the\r\nadvantage of her vast area has been able to outweigh.\r\n\r\nArea itself, important as it is, must yield to location. Location may\r\nmean only a single spot, and yet from this spot powerful influences may\r\nradiate. No one thinks of size when mention is made of Rome or Athens,\r\nof Jerusalem or Mecca, of Gibraltar or Port Arthur. Iceland and\r\nGreenland guided early Norse ships to the continent of America, as the\r\nCanaries and Antilles did those of Spain; but the location of the\r\nsmaller islands in sub-tropical latitudes and in the course of the\r\nnortheast trade-winds made them determine the first permanent path\r\nacross the western seas.\r\n\r\nThe historical significance of many small peoples, and the historical\r\ninsignificance of many big ones even to the _nil_ point, is merely the\r\nexpression of the preponderant importance of location over area. The\r\nPhoenicians, from their narrow strip of coast at the foot of Mount\r\nLebanon, were disseminators of culture over the whole Mediterranean.\r\nHolland owed her commercial and maritime supremacy, from the thirteenth\r\nto the middle of the seventeenth century, to her exceptional position at\r\nthe mouth of the great Rhine highway and at the southern angle of the\r\nNorth Sea near the entrance to the unexploited regions of the Baltic.\r\nThe Iroquois tribes, located where the Mohawk Valley opened a way\r\nthrough the Appalachian barrier between the Hudson River and Lake\r\nOntario, occupied both in the French wars and in the Revolution a\r\nstrategic position which gave them a power and importance out of all\r\nproportion to their numbers.\r\n\r\nLocation often assumes a fictitious political value, due to a\r\ncombination of political interests. The Turkish power owes its survival\r\non the soil of Europe to-day wholly to its position on the Bosporus.\r\nHolland owes the integrity of her kingdom, and Roumania that of hers, to\r\ntheir respective locations at the mouths of the Rhine and the Danube,\r\nbecause the interest of western Europe demands that these two important\r\narteries of commerce should be held by powers too weak ever to tie them\r\nup. The same principle has guaranteed the neutrality of Switzerland,\r\nwhose position puts it in control of the passes of the Central Alps from\r\nSavoy to the Tyrol; and, more recently, that of the young state of\r\nPanama, through which the Isthmian Canal is to pass.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Content of the term location.]\r\n\r\nGeographical location necessarily includes the idea of the size and form\r\nof a country. Even the most general statement of the zonal and\r\ninteroceanic situation of Canada, the United States, Mexico, and the\r\nRussian Empire, indicates the area and contour of their territories.\r\nThis is still more conspicuously the case with naturally defined\r\nregions, such as island and peninsula countries. But location includes a\r\ncomplex of yet larger and more potent relations which go with mere\r\nattachment to this or that continent, or to one or another side of a\r\ncontinent. Every part of the world gives to its lands and its people\r\nsome of its own qualities; and so again every part of this part.\r\nArabia, India and Farther India, spurs of the Asiatic land-mass, have\r\nhad and will always have a radically different ethnic and political\r\nhistory from Greece, Italy and Spain, the corresponding peninsulas of\r\nEurope, because the histories of these two groups are bound up in their\r\nrespective continents. The idea of a European state has a different\r\ncontent from that of an Asiatic, or North American or African state; it\r\nincludes a different race or combination of races, different social and\r\neconomic development, different political ideals. Location, therefore,\r\nmeans climate and plant life at one end of the scale, civilization and\r\npolitical status at the other.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Intercontinental location.]\r\n\r\nThis larger conception of location brings a correspondingly larger\r\nconception of environment, which affords the solution of many otherwise\r\nhopeless problems of anthropo-geography. It is embodied in the law that\r\nthe influences of a land upon its people spring not only from the\r\nphysical features of the land itself, but also from a wide circle of\r\nlands into which it has been grouped by virtue of its location. Almost\r\nevery geographical interpretation of the ancient and modern history of\r\nGreece has been inadequate, because it has failed sufficiently to\r\nemphasize the most essential factor in this history, namely, Greece's\r\nlocation at the threshold of the Orient. This location has given to\r\nGreek history a strong Asiatic color. It comes out in the accessibility\r\nof Greece to ancient Oriental civilization and commerce, and is\r\nconspicuous in every period from the Argonautic Expedition to the\r\nachievement of independence in 1832 and the recent efforts for the\r\nliberation of Crete. This outpost location before the Mediterranean\r\nportals of the vast and arid plains of southwestern Asia, exposed to\r\nevery tide of migration or conquest sent out by those hungry lands, had\r\nin it always an element of weakness. In comparison with the shadow of\r\nAsia, which constantly overhung the Greek people and from 1401 to 1832\r\nenveloped them, only secondary importance can be attributed to\r\nadvantageous local conditions as factors in Greek history.\r\n\r\nIt is a similar intercontinental location in the isthmian region between\r\nthe Mediterranean on the west and the ancient maritime routes of the\r\nRed Sea and Persian Gulf on the east, which gave to Phoenicia the office\r\nof middleman between the Orient and Occident,[240] and predestined its\r\nconquest, now by the various Asiatic powers of Mesopotamia, now by the\r\nPharaohs of Egypt, now by European Greeks and Romans, now by a\r\nsuccession of Asiatic peoples, till to-day we find it incorporated in\r\nthe Asiatic-European Empire of Turkey. Proximity to Africa has closely\r\nallied Spain to the southern continent in flora, fauna, and ethnic\r\nstock. The long-headed, brunette Mediterranean race occupies the Iberian\r\nPeninsula and the Berber territory of northwest Africa.[241] This\r\ncommunity of race is also reflected in the political union of the two\r\ndistricts for long periods, first under the Carthaginians, then the\r\nRomans, who secured Hispania by a victory on African soil, and finally\r\nby the Saracens. This same African note in Spanish history recurs to-day\r\nin Spain's interest in Morocco and the influence in Moroccan affairs\r\nyielded her by France and Germany at the Algeciras convention in 1905,\r\nand in her ownership of Ceuta and five smaller _presidios_ on the\r\nMoroccan coast. Compare Portugal's former ownership of Tangier.\r\n\r\nIn contradistinction to continental and intercontinental location,\r\nanthropo-geography recognizes two other narrower meanings of the term.\r\nThe innate mobility of the human race, due primarily to the eternal\r\nfood-quest and increase of numbers, leads a people to spread out over a\r\nterritory till they reach the barriers which nature has set up, or meet\r\nthe frontiers of other tribes and nations. Their habitat or their\r\nspecific geographic location is thus defined by natural features of\r\nmountain, desert and sea, or by the neighbors whom they are unable to\r\ndisplace, or more often by both.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Natural versus vicinal location.]\r\n\r\nA people has, therefore, a twofold location, an immediate one, based\r\nupon their actual territory, and a mediate or vicinal one, growing out\r\nof its relations to the countries nearest them. The first is a question\r\nof the land under their feet; the other, of the neighbors about them.\r\nThe first or natural location embodies the complex of local geographic\r\nconditions which furnish the basis for their tribal or national\r\nexistence. This basis may be a peninsula, island, archipelago, an oasis,\r\nan arid steppe, a mountain system, or a fertile lowland. The stronger\r\nthe vicinal location, the more dependent is the people upon the\r\nneighboring states, but the more potent the influence which it can,\r\nunder certain circumstances, exert upon them. Witness Germany in\r\nrelation to Holland, France, Austria and Poland. The stronger the\r\nnatural location, on the other hand, the more independent is the people\r\nand the more strongly marked is the national character. This is\r\nexemplified in the people of mountain lands like Switzerland, Abyssinia\r\nand Nepal; of peninsulas like Korea, Spain and Scandinavia; and of\r\nislands like England and Japan. To-day we stand amazed at that strong\r\nprimordial brand of the Japanese character which nothing can blur or\r\nerase.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Naturally defined location.]\r\n\r\nClearly defined natural locations, in which barriers of mountains and\r\nsea draw the boundaries and guarantee some degree of isolation, tend to\r\nhold their people in a calm embrace, to guard them against outside\r\ninterference and infusion of foreign blood, and thus to make them\r\ndevelop the national genius in such direction as the local geographic\r\nconditions permit. In the unceasing movements which have made up most of\r\nthe historic and prehistoric life of the human race, in their migrations\r\nand counter-migrations, their incursions, retreats, and expansions over\r\nthe face of the earth, vast unfenced areas, like the open lowlands of\r\nRussia and the grasslands of Africa, present the picture of a great\r\nthoroughfare swept by pressing throngs. Other regions, more secluded,\r\nappear as quiet nooks, made for a temporary halt or a permanent rest.\r\nHere some part of the passing human flow is caught as in a vessel and\r\nheld till it crystallizes into a nation. These are the conspicuous areas\r\nof race characterization. The development of the various ethnic and\r\npolitical offspring of the Roman Empire in the naturally defined areas\r\nof Italy, the Iberian Peninsula, and France illustrates the process of\r\nnational differentiation which goes on in such secluded locations.\r\n\r\nA marked influence upon this development is generally ascribed to the\r\nprotection afforded by such segregated districts. But protection alone\r\nis only a negative force in the life of a people; it leaves them free to\r\ndevelop in their own way, but does not say what that way shall be. On\r\nthe other hand, the fact that such a district embraces a certain number\r\nof geographic features, and encompasses them by obstructive boundaries,\r\nis of immense historical importance; because this restriction leads to\r\nthe concentration of the national powers, to the more thorough\r\nutilization of natural advantages, both racial and geographical, and\r\nthereby to the growth of an historical individuality. Nothing robs the\r\nhistorical process of so much of its greatness or weakens so much its\r\neffects as its dispersion over a wide, boundless area. This was the\r\ndisintegrating force which sapped the strength of the French colonies in\r\nAmerica. The endless valleys of the St. Lawrence and the Mississippi and\r\nthe alluring fur trade tempted them to an expansion that was their\r\npolitical and economic undoing. Russia's history illustrates the curse\r\nof a distant horizon. On the other hand, out of a restricted\r\ngeographical base, with its power to concentrate and intensify the\r\nnational forces, grew Rome and Greece, England and Japan, ancient Peru\r\nand the Thirteen Colonies of America.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Vicinal location.]\r\n\r\nIf even the most detached and isolated of these natural locations be\r\nexamined, its people will, nevertheless, reveal a transitional\r\ncharacter, intermediate between those of its neighbors, because from\r\nthese it has borrowed both ethnic stock and culture, Great Britain is an\r\nisland, but its vicinal location groups it with the North Sea family of\r\npeople. Even in historic times it has derived ancient Belgian stock,\r\nRoman, Anglo-Saxon, Danish and Scandinavian from the long semi-circle of\r\nnearby continental lands, which have likewise contributed so much to the\r\ncivilization of the island. Similarly, Japan traces the sources of its\r\npopulation to the north of Asia by way of the island of Sakhalin, to the\r\nwest through Korea, and to the Malay district of the south, whence the\r\nKuro Siwa has swept stragglers to the shores of Kiu-siu. Like England,\r\nJapan also has drawn its civilization from its neighbors, and then,\r\nunder the isolating influence of its local environment, has\r\nindividualized both race and culture. Here we have the interplay of the\r\nforces of natural and vicinal location.\r\n\r\nA people situated between two other peoples form an ethnic and cultural\r\nlink between the two. The transitional type is as familiar in\r\nanthropo-geography as in biology. The only exception is found in the\r\nyoung intrusion of a migrating or conquering people, like that of the\r\nHungarians and Turks in southeastern Europe, and of the Berger Tuaregs\r\nand Fulbes among the negroes of western Sudan; or of a colonizing\r\npeople, like that of the Russians in Mongolian Siberia and of Europeans\r\namong the aborigines of South Africa. Even in these instances race\r\namalgamation tends to take place along the frontiers, as was the case in\r\nLatin America and as occurs to-day in Alaska and northern Canada, where\r\nthe \"squaw man\" is no rarity. The assimilation of culture, at least in a\r\nsuperficial sense, may be yet more rapid, especially where hard climatic\r\nconditions force the interloper to imitate the life of the native. The\r\nindustrial and commercial Hollander, when transplanted to the dry\r\ngrasslands of South Africa, became pastoral like the native Kaffirs. The\r\nFrench voyageur of Canada could scarcely be distinguished from the\r\nIndian trapper; occupation, food, dress, and spouse were the same. Only\r\na lighter tint of skin distinguished the half-breed children of the\r\nFrenchman. The settlers of the early Trans-Allegheny commonwealths, at\r\nleast for a generation or two, showed little outward difference in mode\r\nof life from that of the savage community among which they dwelt.[242]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Vicinal groups of similar or diverse race and culture.]\r\n\r\nThe more alike the components of such a vicinal group of people, the\r\neasier, freer and more effective will be the mediating function of the\r\ncentral one. Germany has demonstrated this in her long history as\r\nintermediary between the nations of southeastern and western Europe. The\r\npeople of Poland, occupying a portion of the Baltic slope of northern\r\nEurope, fended by no natural barriers from their eastern and western\r\nneighbors, long constituted a transition form between the two. Though\r\naffiliated with Russia in point of language, the Poles are Occidental in\r\ntheir religion; and their head-form resembles that of northern Germany\r\nrather than that of Russia.[243] The country belongs to western Europe in\r\nthe density of its population (74 to the square kilometer or 190 to the\r\nsquare mile), which is quadruple that of remaining European Russia, and\r\nalso in its industrial and social development. The partition of Poland\r\namong the three neighboring powers was the final expression of its\r\nintermediate location and character.[244] One part was joined politically\r\nto the Slav-German western border of Russia, and another to the\r\nGerman-Slav border of Germany, while the portion that fell to the\r\nAustrian Empire simply extended the northern Slav area of that country\r\nfound in Bohemia, Moravia, and the Slovak border of Hungary. [Map page\r\n223.]\r\n\r\nIf the intermediate people greatly differs in race or civilization from\r\nboth neighbors, it exercises and receives slight influence. The Mongols\r\nof Central Asia, between China on one side and Persia and India on the\r\nother, have been poor vehicles for the exchange of culture between these\r\ntwo great districts. The Hungarians, located between the Roumanians and\r\nGermans on the east and west, Slovaks and Croatians on the north and\r\nsouth, have helped little to reconcile race differences in the great\r\nempire of the Danube.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Thalassic vicinal location.]\r\n\r\nThe unifying effect of vicinal location is greatly enhanced if the\r\nneighboring people are grouped about an enclosed sea which affords an\r\neasy highway for communication. The integrating force of such a basin\r\nwill often overcome the disintegrating force of race antagonisms. The\r\nRoman Empire in the Mediterranean was able to evolve an effective\r\ncentralized government and to spread one culture over the neighboring\r\nshores, despite great variety of nationality and language and every\r\ndegree of cultural development. A certain similarity of natural\r\nconditions, climatic and otherwise, from the Iberian Peninsula to the\r\nborders of the Syrian desert, also aided in the process of amalgamation.\r\n\r\nWhere similarity of race already forms a basis for congeniality, such\r\ncircumthalassic groups display the highest degree of interactive\r\ninfluence. These contribute to a further blending of population and\r\nunification of culture, by which the whole circle of the enclosing lands\r\ntends to approach one standard of civilization. This was the history of\r\nthe Baltic coast from the thirteenth to the sixteenth centuries, when\r\nthe German Hansa distributed the material products of Europe's highest\r\ncivilization from Russian Novgorod to Norway. The North Sea group,\r\nfirst under the leadership of Holland, later under England's guidance,\r\nbecame a single community of advancing culture, which was a later\r\nreflection of the early community of race stretching from the Faroe and\r\nShetland Islands to the Rhine and the Elbe. This same process has been\r\ngoing on for ages about the marginal basins of eastern Asia, the Yellow\r\nand Japan Seas. Community of race and culture stamps China, Korea and\r\nJapan. A general advance in civilization under the leadership of Japan,\r\nthe England of the East, now inaugurates the elevation of the whole\r\ngroup.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Complementary locations.]\r\n\r\nAn even closer connection exists between adjoining peoples who are\r\nunited by ties of blood and are further made economically dependent upon\r\none another, because of a contrast in the physical conditions and,\r\ntherefore, in the products of their respective territories. Numerous\r\ncoast and inland tribes, pastoral and agricultural tribes are united\r\nbecause they are mutually necessary. In British Columbia and Alaska the\r\nfishing Indians of the seaboard long held a definite commercial relation\r\nto the hunting tribes of the interior, selling them the products and\r\nwares of the coast, while monopolizing their market for the inland furs.\r\nSuch was the position of the Ugalentz tribe of Tlingits near the mouth\r\nof the Copper River in relation to the up-stream Athapascans; of the\r\nKinik tribe at the head of Cook's Inlet in relation to the inland\r\nAtnas,[245] of the Chilcats of Chilkoot Inlet to the mountain Tinnehs.\r\nSimilarly, the hunting folk of the Kalahari Desert in South Africa\r\nattach themselves to influential tribesmen of the adjacent Bechuana\r\ngrasslands, in order to exchange the skins of the desert animals for\r\nspears, knives, and tobacco.[246] Fertile agricultural lands adjoining\r\npastoral regions of deserts and steppes have in all times drawn to their\r\nborder markets the mounted plainsmen, bringing the products of their\r\nherds to exchange for grain; and in all times the abundance of their\r\ngreen fields has tempted their ill-fed neighbors to conquest, so that\r\nthe economic bond becomes a preliminary to a political bond and an\r\nethnic amalgamation growing out of this strong vicinal location. The\r\nforest lands of Great Russia supplement the grain-bearing Black Lands\r\nof Little Russia; the two are united through geographico-economic\r\nconditions, which would not permit an independent existence to the\r\nsmaller, weaker section of the south, ever open to hostile invasion from\r\nAsia.[247]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Types of location.]\r\n\r\nLeaving now the ethnic and economic ties which may strengthen the\r\ncohesive power of such vicinal grouping, and considering only its purely\r\ngeographic aspects, we distinguish the following types:\r\n\r\n     I. Central location. Examples: The Magyars in the Danube Valley;\r\n     the Iroquois Indians on the Mohawk River and the Finger Lakes;\r\n     Russia from the 10th to the 18th century; Poland from 1000 to its\r\n     final partition in 1795; Bolivia, Switzerland, and Afghanistan.\r\n\r\n     II. Peripheral location: Ancient Phoenicia; Greek colonies in Asia\r\n     Minor and southern Italy; the Roman Empire at the accession of\r\n     Augustus; the Thirteen Colonies in 1750; island and peninsula\r\n     lands.\r\n\r\n     III. Scattered location: English and French settlements in America\r\n     prior to 1700; Indians in the United States and the Kaffirs in\r\n     South Africa; Portuguese holdings in the Orient, and French in\r\n     India.\r\n\r\n     IV. Location in a related series: Oasis states grouped along desert\r\n     routes; islands along great marine routes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Continuous and scattered location.]\r\n\r\nAll peoples in their geographical distribution tend to follow a social\r\nand political law of gravitation, in accordance with which members of\r\nthe same tribe or race gather around a common center or occupy a\r\ncontinuous stretch of territory, as compactly as their own economic\r\nstatus, and the physical conditions of climate and soil will permit.\r\nThis is characteristic of all mature and historically significant\r\npeoples who have risen to sedentary life, maintained their hold on a\r\ngiven territory, and, with increase of population, have widened their\r\nboundaries. The nucleus of such a people may be situated somewhere in\r\nthe interior of a continent, and with growing strength it may expand in\r\nevery direction; or it may originate on some advantageous inlet of the\r\nsea and spread thence up and down the coast, till the people have\r\npossessed themselves of a long-drawn hem of land and used this\r\nperipheral location to intercept the trade between their back country\r\nand the sea.\r\n\r\nThese are the two types of continuous location. In contrast to them, a\r\ndiscontinuous or scattered location characterizes the sparse\r\ndistribution of primitive hunting and pastoral tribes; or the shattered\r\nfragments of a conquered people, whose territory has been honeycombed by\r\nthe land appropriation of the victors; or a declining, moribund people,\r\nwho, owing to bad government, poor economic methods, and excessive\r\ncompetition in the struggle for existence, have shrunk to mere patches.\r\nAs a favorable symptom, scattered location regularly marks the healthy\r\ngrowth of an expanding people, who throw out here and there detached\r\ncenters of settlement far beyond the compact frontier, and fix these as\r\nthe goal for the advance of their boundary. It is also a familiar\r\nfeature of maritime commercial expansion, which is guided by no\r\nterritorial ambition but merely aims to secure widely distributed\r\ntrading stations at favorable coast points, in order to make the circle\r\nof commerce as ample and resourceful as possible. But this latter form\r\nof scattered location is not permanently sound. Back of it lies the\r\nshort-sighted policy of the middleman nation, which makes wholly\r\ninadequate estimate of the value of land, and is content with an\r\nephemeral prosperity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Central versus peripheral location.]\r\n\r\nA broad territorial base and security of possession are the guarantees\r\nof national survival. The geographic conditions which favor one often\r\noperate against the other. Peripheral location means a narrow base but a\r\nprotected frontier along the sea; central location means opportunity for\r\nwidening the territory, but it also means danger. A state embedded in\r\nthe heart of a continent has, if strong, every prospect of radial\r\nexpansion and the exercise of widespread influence; but if weak, its\r\nvery existence is imperilled, because it is exposed to encroachments on\r\nevery side. A central location minus the bulwark of natural boundaries\r\nenabled the kingdom of Poland to be devoured piecemeal by its voracious\r\nneighbors. The kingdom of Burgundy, always a state of fluctuating\r\nboundaries and shifting allegiances, fell at last a victim to its\r\ncentral location, and saw its name obliterated from the map. Hungary,\r\nwhich, in the year 1000, occupied a restricted inland location on the\r\nmiddle Danube, by the 14th century broke through the barriers of its\r\nclose-hugging neighbors, and stretched its boundaries from the Adriatic\r\nto the Euxine; two hundred years later its territory contracted to a\r\nfragment before the encroachments of the Turks, but afterwards recovered\r\nin part its old dimensions. Germany has, in common with the little\r\nSudanese state of Wadai, an influential and dangerous position. A\r\ncentral location in the Sudan has made Wadai accessible to the rich\r\ncaravan trade from Tripoli and Barca on the north, from the great market\r\ntown of Kano in Sokoto on the west, and from the Nile Valley and Red Sea\r\non the east. But the little state has had to fight for its life against\r\nthe aggressions of its western rival Bornu and its eastern neighbor\r\nDarfur. And now more formidable enemies menace it in the French, who\r\nhave occupied the territory between it and Bornu, and the English, who\r\nhave already caught Darfur in the dragnet of the Egyptian Sudan.[248]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Danger of central location.]\r\n\r\nGermany, crowded in among three powerful neighbors like France, Russia,\r\nand Austria, has had no choice about maintaining a strong standing army\r\nand impregnable frontier defenses. The location of the Central European\r\nstates between the Baltic and the Balkans has exposed them to all the\r\nlimitations and dangers arising from a narrow circle of land neighbors.\r\nMoreover, the diversified character of the area, its complex mountain\r\nsystems, and diverging river courses have acted as disintegrating forces\r\nwhich have prevented the political concentration necessary to repel\r\ninterference from without. The Muscovite power, which had its beginning\r\nin a modest central location about the sources of the Dwina, Dnieper and\r\nVolga, was aided by the physical unity of its unobstructed plains, which\r\nfacilitated political combination. Hence, on every side it burst through\r\nits encompassing neighbors and stretched its boundaries to the\r\nuntenanted frontier of the sea. Central location was the undoing of the\r\nTransvaal Republic. Its efforts to expand to the Indian Ocean were\r\nblocked by its powerful British rival at every point--at Delagoa Bay in\r\n1875 by treaty with Portugal, at Santa Lucia Bay in 1884, and through\r\nSwaziland in 1894. The Orange Free State was maimed in the same way\r\nwhen, in 1868, she tried to stretch out an arm through Basutoland to the\r\nsea.[249] Here even weak neighbors were effective to curtail the seaward\r\ngrowth of these inland states, because they were made the tools of one\r\nstrong, rapacious neighbor. A central position teaches always the lesson\r\nof vigilance and preparedness for hostilities, as the Boer equipment in\r\n1899, the military organization of Germany, and the bristling fortresses\r\non the Swiss Alpine passes prove.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mutual relations between center and periphery.]\r\n\r\nHow intimate and necessary are the relations between central and\r\nperipheral location is shown by the fact that all states strive to\r\ncombine the two. In countries like Norway, France, Spain, Japan, Korea\r\nand Chile, peripheral location predominates, and therefore confers upon\r\nthem at once the security and commercial accessibility which result from\r\ncontact with the sea. Other countries, like Russia, Germany and\r\nAustro-Hungary, chiefly central in location, have the strategic and even\r\nthe commercial value of their coasts reduced by the long, tortuous\r\ncourse which connects them with the open ocean. Therefore, we find\r\nRussia planning to make a great port at Ekaterina Harbor on the\r\nnorthernmost point of her Lapland coast, where an out-runner from the\r\nGulf Stream ensures an ice-free port on the open sea.[250] An admirable\r\ncombination of central and peripheral location is seen in the United\r\nStates. Here the value of periphery is greatly enhanced by the\r\ninteroceanic location of the country; and the danger of entanglements\r\narising from a marked central location is reduced by the simplicity of\r\nthe political neighborhood. But our country has paid for this security\r\nby an historical aloofness and poverty of influence. Civilized countries\r\nwhich are wholly central in their location are very few, only nine in\r\nall. Six of these are mountain or plateau states, like Switzerland and\r\nAbyssinia, which have used the fortress character of their land to\r\nresist conquest, and have preferred independence to the commercial\r\nadvantages to be gained only by affiliation with their peripheral\r\nneighbors.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Inland and coastward expansion.]\r\n\r\nCentral and peripheral location presuppose and supplement one another.\r\nOne people inhabits the interior of an island or continent whose rim is\r\noccupied by another. The first suffers from exclusion from the sea and\r\ntherefore strives to get a strip of coast. The coast people feel the\r\ndrawback of their narrow foothold upon the land, want a broader base in\r\norder to exploit fully the advantages of their maritime location, fear\r\nthe pressure of their hinterland when the great forces there imprisoned\r\nshall begin to move; so they tend to expand inland to strengthen\r\nthemselves and weaken the neighbor in their rear. The English colonies\r\nof America, prior to 1763, held a long cordon of coast, hemmed in\r\nbetween the Appalachian Mountains and the sea. Despite threats of French\r\nencroachments from the interior, they expanded from this narrow\r\nperipheral base into the heart of the continent, and after the\r\nRevolution reached the Mississippi River and the northern boundary of\r\nthe Spanish Floridas. They now held a central location in relation to\r\nthe long Spanish periphery of the Gulf of Mexico. True to the instincts\r\nof that location, they began to throw the weight of their vast\r\nhinterland against the weak coastal barrier. This gave way, either to\r\nforcible appropriation of territory or diplomacy or war, till the United\r\nStates had incorporated in her own territory the peripheral lands of the\r\nGulf from Florida Strait to the Rio Grande. [See map page 156.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Russian expansion in Asia.]\r\n\r\nIn Asia this same process has been perennial and on a far greater scale.\r\nThe big arid core of that continent, containing many million square\r\nmiles, has been charged with an expansive force. From the appearance of\r\nthe Aryans in the Indus Valley and the Scythians on the borders of\r\nMacedonia, it has sent out hordes to overwhelm the peripheral lands from\r\nthe Yellow Sea to the Black, and from the Indian Ocean to the White\r\nSea.[251] To-day Russia is making history there on the pattern set by\r\ngeographic conditions. From her most southerly province in Trans-Caspia,\r\nconquered a short twenty-five years ago, she is heading towards the\r\nIndian Ocean. The Anglo-Russian convention of August 31st, 1907,\r\nyielding to Russia all northern Persia as her sphere of influence,\r\nenables her to advance half way to the Persian Gulf, though British\r\nstatesmen regard it as a check upon her ambition, because England has\r\nsecured right to the littoral. But Russia by this great stride toward\r\nher goal is working with causes, satisfied to let the effects follow at\r\ntheir leisure. She has gained the best portion of Persia, comprising\r\nthe six largest cities and the most important lines of communication\r\nradiating from the capital.[252] This country will make a solid base for\r\nher further advance to the Persian Gulf; and, when developed by Russian\r\nenterprise in railroad building and commerce, it will make a heavy\r\nweight bearing down upon the coast. The Muscovite area which is pressing\r\nupon England's Persian littoral reaches from Ispahan and Yezd to the\r\nfar-away shores of the Arctic Ocean.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Periphery as goal of expansion.]\r\n\r\nIn the essentially complementary character of interior and periphery are\r\nrooted all these coastward and landward movements of expansion. Where an\r\nequilibrium seems to have been reached, the peoples who have accepted\r\neither the one or the other one-sided location have generally for the\r\ntime being ceased to grow. Such a location has therefore a passive\r\ncharacter. But the surprising elasticity of many nations may start up an\r\nunexpected activity which will upset this equilibrium. Where the central\r\nlocation is that of small mountain states, which are handicapped by\r\nlimited resources and population, like Nepal and Afghanistan, or\r\novershadowed by far more powerful neighbors, like Switzerland, the\r\npassive character is plain enough. In the case of larger states, like\r\nServia, Abyssinia, and Bolivia, which offer the material and\r\ngeographical base for larger populations than they now support, it is\r\noften difficult to say whether progression or retrogression is to be\r\ntheir fate. As a rule, however, the expulsion of a people from a\r\nperipheral point of advantage and their confinement in the interior\r\ngives the sign of national decay, as did Poland's loss of her Baltic\r\nseaboard. Russia's loss of her Manchurian port and the resignation of\r\nher ambition on the Chinese coasts is at least a serious check. On the\r\nother hand, if an inland country enclosed by neighbors succeeds in\r\nsomewhere getting a maritime outlet, the sign is hopeful. The\r\ncentury-old political slogan of Hungary, \"To the sea, Magyars!\" has\r\nborne fruit in the Adriatic harbor of Fiume, which is to-day the pride\r\nof the nation and in no small degree a basis for its hope of autonomy.\r\nThe history of Montenegro took on a new phase when from its mountain\r\nseclusion it recently secured the short strip of seaboard which it had\r\nwon and lost so often. Such peripheral holdings are the lungs through\r\nwhich states breathe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reaction between center and periphery.]\r\n\r\nHistory and the study of race distribution reveal a mass of facts which\r\nrepresent the contrast and reaction between interior and periphery. The\r\nmarginal lands of Asia, from northern Japan, where climatic conditions\r\nfirst make historical development possible, around the whole fringe of\r\nislands, peninsulas and border lowlands to the Aegean coast of Asia\r\nMinor, present a picture of culture and progress as compared with the\r\nhigh, mountain-rimmed core of the continent, condemned by its remoteness\r\nand inaccessibility to eternal retardation. Europe shows the same\r\ncontrast, though in less pronounced form. Its ragged periphery, all the\r\nway from the Balkan Gibraltar at Constantinople to the far northern\r\nprojections of Scandinavia and Finland, shows the value of a seaward\r\noutlook both in culture and climate. Germany beyond the Elbe and Austria\r\nbeyond the Danube begin to feel the shadow of the continental mass\r\nbehind them; and from their eastern borders on through Russia the\r\nbenumbing influence of a central location grows, till beyond the Volga\r\nthe climatic, economic, social and political conditions of Asia prevail.\r\nAfrica is all core: contour and relief have combined to reduce its\r\nperiphery to a narrow coastal hem, offering at best a few vantage points\r\nfor exploitation to the great maritime merchant peoples of the world.\r\nEgypt, embedded in an endless stretch of desert like a jewel in its\r\nmatrix, was powerless to shake off the influence of its continental\r\nenvironment. Its location was predominantly central; its culture bore\r\nthe stamp of isolation and finally of arrested development. Australia,\r\nthe classic ground of retardation, where only shades of savagery can be\r\ndistinguished, offered the natives of its northern coast some faint\r\nstimuli in the visits of Malay seamen from the nearby Sunda Islands; but\r\nits central tribes, shielded by geographic segregation from external\r\ninfluences, have retained the most primitive customs and beliefs.[253]\r\n\r\nExpanding Europe has long been wrestling with Africa, but it can not get\r\na grip, owing to the form of its antagonist; it finds no limb by which\r\nthe giant can be tripped and thrown. Asia presents a wide border of\r\nmarginal lands, some of them like Arabia and India being almost\r\ncontinental in their proportions. Since Europe began her career of\r\nmaritime and colonial expansion in the sixteenth and seventeenth\r\ncenturies, she has seized upon these peripheral projections as if they\r\nwere the handles on a pilot wheel, and by them she has steered the\r\ncourse of Asia ever since. These semi-detached outlyers of the continent\r\nhave enabled her to stretch a girdle of European influences around the\r\ncentral core. Such influences, through the avenues of commerce, railway\r\nconcessions, missionary propaganda, or political dominion, have\r\npermeated the accessible periphery and are slowly spreading thence into\r\nthe interior. China and Persia have felt these influences not less than\r\nIndia and Tongking; Japan, which has most effectually preserved its\r\npolitical autonomy, has profited by them most.\r\n\r\nThis historical contrast between center and periphery of continents\r\nreappears in smaller land masses, such as peninsulas and islands. The\r\nprinciple holds good regardless of size. The whole fringe of Arabia,\r\nfrom Antioch to Aden and from Mocha to Mascat, has been the scene of\r\nincoming and outgoing activities, has developed live bases of trade,\r\nmaritime growth, and culture, while the inert, somnolent interior has\r\ndrowsed away its long eventless existence. The rugged, inaccessible\r\nheart of little Sardinia repeats the story of central Arabia in its\r\naloofness, its impregnability, backwardness, and in the purity of its\r\nrace. Its accessible coast, forming a convenient way-station on the\r\nmaritime crossroads of the western Mediterranean, has received a\r\nsuccession of conquerors and an intermittent influx of every ethnic\r\nstrain known in the great basin.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Periphery of colonization.]\r\n\r\nThe story of discovery and colonization, from the days of ancient Greek\r\nenterprise in the Mediterranean to the recent German expansion along the\r\nGulf of Guinea, shows the appropriation first of the rims of islands and\r\ncontinents, and later that of the interior. A difference of race and\r\nculture between inland and peripheral inhabitants meets us almost\r\neverywhere in retarded colonial lands. In the Philippines, the wild\r\npeople of Luzon, Mindoro and the Visayas are confined almost entirely\r\nto the interior, while civilized or Christianized Malays occupy the\r\nwhole seaboard, except where the rugged Sierra Madre Mountains, fronting\r\nthe Pacific in Luzon, harbor a sparse population of primitive\r\nNegritos.[254] For centuries Arabs held the coast of East Africa, where\r\ntheir narrow zone of settlement bordered on that of native blacks, with\r\nwhom they traded. Even ancient Greece showed a wide difference in type\r\nof character and culture between the inland and maritime states. The\r\nGreek landsman was courageous and steadfast, but crude, illiterate,\r\nunenterprising, showing sterility of imagination and intellect; while\r\nhis brother of the seaboard was active, daring, mercurial, imaginative,\r\nopen to all the influences of a refining civilization.[255] To-day the\r\ndistribution of the Greeks along the rim of the Balkan peninsula and\r\nAsia Minor, in contrast to the Turks and Slavs of the interior, is\r\ndistinctly a peripheral phenomenon.[256]\r\n\r\nThe rapid inland advance from the coast of oversea colonists is part of\r\nthat restless activity which is fostered by contact with the sea and\r\nsupported by the command of abundant resources conferred by maritime\r\nsuperiority. The Anglo-Saxon invasion of England, as later the English\r\ncolonization of America, seized the rim of the land, and promptly pushed\r\nup the rivers in sea-going boats far into the interior. But periphery\r\nmay give to central region something more than conquerors and colonists.\r\nFrom its active markets and cosmopolitan exchanges there steadily filter\r\ninto the interior culture and commodities, carried by peaceful merchant\r\nand missionary, who, however, are often only the harbingers of the\r\nconqueror. The accessibility of the periphery tends to raise it in\r\nculture, wealth, density of population, and often in political\r\nimportance, far in advance of the center.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHILIPPINE ISLANDS. Distribution of Civilized and Wild\r\nPeoples]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dominant historical side.]\r\n\r\nThe maritime periphery of a country receives a variety of oversea\r\ninfluences, blends and assimilates these to its own culture, Hellenizes,\r\nAmericanizes or Japanizes them, as the case may be, and then passes them\r\non into the interior. Here no one foreign influence prevails. On the\r\nland boundaries the case is different. Each inland frontier has to\r\nreckon with a different neighbor and its undiluted influence. A\r\npredominant central location means a succession of such neighbors, on\r\nall sides friction which may polish or rub sore. The distinction\r\nbetween a many-sided and a one-sided historical development depends upon\r\nthe contact of a people with its neighbors. Consider the multiplicity of\r\ninfluences which have flowed in upon Austria from all sides. But not all\r\nsuch influences are similar in kind or in degree. The most powerful\r\nneighbor will chiefly determine on which boundary of a country its\r\ndominant historical processes are to work themselves out in a given\r\nepoch. Therefore, it is of supreme importance to the character of a\r\npeopled history on which side this most powerful neighbor is located.\r\nRussia had for several centuries such a neighbor in the Tartar hordes\r\nalong its southeastern frontier, and therefore its history received an\r\nAsiatic stamp; so, too, did that of Austria and Hungary in the long\r\nresistance to Turkish invasion. All three states suffered in consequence\r\na retardation of development on their western sides. After the turmoil\r\non the Asiatic frontier had subsided, the great centers of European\r\nculture and commerce in Italy, Germany and the Baltic lands began to\r\nassert their powers of attraction. The young Roman Republic drew up its\r\nforces to face the threatening power of Carthage in the south, and\r\nthereby was forced into rapid maritime development; the Roman Empire\r\nfaced north to meet the inroads of the barbarians, and thereby was drawn\r\ninto inland expansion. All these instances show that a vital historical\r\nturning-point is reached in the development of every country, when the\r\nscene of its great historical happenings shifts from one side to\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Mediterranean side of Europe.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the aggressive neighbor, there is often a more sustained\r\nforce that may draw the activities of a people toward one or another\r\nboundary of their territory. This may be the abundance of land and\r\nunexploited resources lying on a colonial frontier and attracting the\r\nunemployed energies of the people, such as existed till recently in the\r\nUnited States,[257] and such as is now transferring the most active\r\nscenes of Russian history to far-away Siberia. But a stronger attraction\r\nis that of a higher civilization and dominant economic interests. So\r\nlong as the known world was confined to the temperate regions of Europe,\r\nAsia and Africa, together with the tropical districts of the Indian\r\nOcean, the necessities of trade between Orient and Occident and the\r\nhistorical prestige of the lands bordering on the Mediterranean placed\r\nin this basin the center of gravity of the cultural, commercial and\r\npolitical life of Europe. The continent was dominated by its Asiatic\r\ncorner; its every country took on an historical significance\r\nproportionate to its proximity and accessibility to this center. The\r\nPapacy was a Mediterranean power. The Crusades were Mediterranean wars.\r\nAthens, Rome, Constantinople, Venice, and Genoa held in turn the focal\r\npositions in this Asiatic-European sea; they were on the sunny side of\r\nthe continent, while Portugal and England lay in shadow. Only that\r\nportion of Britain facing France felt the cultural influences of the\r\nsouthern lands. The estuaries of the Mersey and Clyde were marshy\r\nsolitudes, echoing to the cry of the bittern and the ripple of Celtic\r\nfishing-boat.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Change of historical front.]\r\n\r\nAfter the year 1492 inaugurated the Atlantic period of history, the\r\nwestern front of Europe superseded the Mediterranean side in the\r\nhistorical leadership of the continent. The Breton coast of France waked\r\nup, the southern seaboard dozed. The old centers in the Aegean and\r\nAdriatic became drowsy corners. The busy traffic of the Mediterranean\r\nwas transferred to the open ocean, where, from Trafalger to Norway, the\r\nwestern states of Europe held the choice location on the world's new\r\nhighway. Liverpool, Plymouth, Glasgow, Hamburg, Rotterdam, Antwerp,\r\nCherbourg, Lisbon and Cadiz were shifted from shadowy margin to\r\nilluminated center, and became the foci of the new activity. Theirs was\r\na new continental location, maintaining relations of trade and\r\ncolonization with two hemispheres. Their neighbors were now found on the\r\nAtlantic shores of the Americas and the peripheral lands of Asia. These\r\ncities became the exponents of the intensity with which their respective\r\nstates exploited the natural advantages of this location.\r\n\r\nThe experience of Germany was typical of the change of front. From the\r\ntenth to the middle of the sixteenth century, this heir of the old Roman\r\nEmpire was drawn toward Italy by every tie of culture, commerce, and\r\npolitical ideal. This concentration of interest in its southern neighbor\r\nmade it ignore a fact so important as the maritime development of the\r\nHanse Towns, wherein lay the real promise of its future, the hope of its\r\ncommercial and colonial expansion. The shifting of its historical center\r\nof gravity to the Atlantic seaboard therefore came late, further\r\nretarded by lack of national unity and national purposes. But the\r\npresent wide circle of Germany's transoceanic commerce incident upon its\r\nrecent industrial development, the phenomenal increase of its merchant\r\nmarine, the growth of Hamburg and Bremen, the construction of ship\r\ncanals to that short North Sea coast, and the enormous utilization of\r\nDutch ports for German commerce, all point to the attraction of distant\r\neconomic interests, even when meagerly supported by colonial\r\npossessions.\r\n\r\nLocation, therefore, while it is the most important single geographic\r\nfactor, is at the same time the one most subject to the vicissitudes\r\nattending the anthropo-geographical evolution of the earth. Its value\r\nchanges with the transfer of the seats of the higher civilizations from\r\nsub-tropical to temperate lands; from the margin of enclosed sea to the\r\nhem of the open ocean; from small, naturally defined territories to\r\nlarge, elastic areas; from mere periphery to a combination of periphery\r\nand interior, commanding at once the freedom of the sea and the\r\nresources of a wide hinterland.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Contrasted historical sides.]\r\n\r\nEven in Europe, however, where the Atlantic leaning of all the states is\r\nso marked as to suggest a certain dependence, the strength of this\r\none-sided attraction is weakened by the complexity and closeness of the\r\nvicinal grouping of the several nations. Germany's reliance upon the\r\nneighboring grain fields of Russia and Hungary and the leather of the\r\nsouthern steppes counteracts somewhat the far-off magnet of America's\r\nwheat and cattle. England experienced a radical change of geographic\r\nfront with the sailing of the Cabots; but the enormous tonnage entering\r\nand passing from the North Sea and Channel ports for her European\r\ntrade[258] show the attraction of the nearby Continent. Oftentimes we\r\nfind two sides of a country each playing simultaneously a different, yet\r\nan equally important historical part, and thus distributing the\r\nhistorical activities, while diversifying the historical development of\r\nthe people. The young United States were profoundly influenced as to\r\nnational ideals and their eventual territorial career by the free, eager\r\nlife and the untrammeled enterprise of its wilderness frontier beyond\r\nthe Alleghenies, while through the Atlantic seaboard it was kept in\r\nsteadying contact with England and the inherited ideals of the race.\r\nRussia is subjected to different influences on its various fronts; it is\r\nprogressive, industrial, socialistic on its European side in Poland;\r\nexpansive and radical in a different way in colonial Siberia; aggressive\r\nin the south, bending its energies toward political expansion along the\r\nMediterranean and Persian Gulf seaboards. In all such countries there is\r\na constant shifting and readjustment of extra-territorial influences.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: One-sided historical relations.]\r\n\r\nIt is otherwise in states of very simple vicinal grouping, coupled with\r\nonly a single country or at best two. Spain, from the time Hamilcar\r\nBarca made it a colony of ancient Carthage, down to the decline of its\r\nSaracen conquerors, was historically linked with Africa. Freeman calls\r\nattention to \"the general law by which, in almost all periods of\r\nhistory, either the masters of Spain have borne rule in Africa or the\r\nmasters of Africa have borne rule in Spain.\" The history of such simply\r\nlocated countries tends to have a correspondingly one-sided character.\r\nPortugal's development has been under the exclusive influence of Spain,\r\nexcept for the oversea stimuli brought to it by the Atlantic. England's\r\nlong southern face close to the French coast had for centuries the\r\neffect of interweaving its history with that of its southern neighbor.\r\nThe conspicuous fact in the foreign history of Japan has been its\r\nintimate connection with Korea above all the other states.[259] Egypt,\r\nwhich projects as an alluvial peninsula into an ocean of desert from\r\nsouthwestern Asia, has seen its history, from the time of the Shepherd\r\nKings to that of Napoleon, repeatedly linked with Palestine and Syria.\r\nEvery Asiatic or European conquest of these two countries has eventually\r\nbeen extended to the valley of the Nile; and Egypt's one great period of\r\nexpansion saw this eastern coast of the Mediterranean as far as the\r\nEuphrates united to the dominion of the Pharaohs. Here is a one-sided\r\ngeographical location in an exaggerated form, emphasized by the\r\nphysical and political barrenness of the adjacent regions of Africa and\r\nthe strategic importance of the isthmian district between the\r\nMediterranean and Indian Ocean.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Scattered location due to geographic conditions.]\r\n\r\nThe forms of vicinal location thus far considered presuppose a compact\r\nor continuous distribution, such as characterizes the more fertile and\r\npopulous areas of the earth. Desert regions, whether due to Arctic cold\r\nor extreme aridity, distribute their sparse population in small groups\r\nat a few favored points, and thus from physical causes give rise to the\r\nanthropo-geographical phenomenon of scattered location. Districts of\r\nintense cold, which sustain life only in contact with marine supplies of\r\nfood, necessitate an intermittent distribution along the seaboard, with\r\nlong, unoccupied stretches between. This is the location we are familiar\r\nwith among the Eskimo of Greenland and Alaska, among the Norse and Lapps\r\nin the rugged Norwegian province of Finmarken, where over two-thirds of\r\nthe population live by fishing. In the interior districts of this\r\nprovince about Karasjok and Kantokeino, the reindeer Lapps show a\r\ncorresponding scattered grouping here and there on the inhospitable\r\nslopes of the mountains.[260] In that one-half of Switzerland lying above\r\nthe altitude where agriculture is possible, population is sprinkled at\r\nwide intervals over the sterile surface of the highlands.\r\n\r\nA somewhat similar scattered location is found in arid deserts, where\r\npopulation is restricted to the oases dropped here and there at wide\r\nintervals amid the waste of sand. But unlike those fragments of human\r\nlife on the frozen outskirts of the habitable world, the oasis states\r\nusually constitute links in a chain of connection across the desert\r\nbetween the fertile lands on either side, and therefore form part of a\r\nseries, in which the members maintain firm and necessary economic\r\nrelations. Every caravan route across the Sahara is dotted by a series\r\nof larger or smaller tribal settlements. Tripoli, Sokna, Murzuk, Bilma\r\nand Bornu form one such chain; Algiers, El Golea, Twat, the salt mines\r\nof Taudeni, Arawan and Timbuctoo, another. Bagdad, Hayil, Boreyda and\r\nMecca trace the road of pilgrim and merchant starting from the Moslem\r\nland of the Euphrates to the shrine of Mohammed.[261]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DISTRIBUTION OF SETTLEMENT IN THE NORWEGIAN PROVINCE OF\r\nFINMARKEN.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Island way station on maritime routes.]\r\n\r\nNot unlike this serial grouping of oasis states along caravan routes\r\nthrough the desert are the island way stations that rise out of the\r\nwaste of the sea and are connected by the great maritime routes of\r\ntrade. Such are the Portuguese Madeiras, Bissagos, and San Thomé on the\r\nline between Lisbon and Portuguese Loanda in West Africa; and their\r\nother series of the Madeiras, Cape Verde, and Fernando, which\r\nfacilitated communication with Pernambuco when Brazil was a Portuguese\r\ncolony. The classic example of this serial grouping is found in the line\r\nof islands, physical or political, which trace England's artery of\r\ncommunication with India--Gibraltar, Malta, Cyprus, Perim, Aden,\r\nSokotra, and Ceylon, besides her dominant position at Suez.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Scattered location of primitive tribes.]\r\n\r\nQuite different from this scattered distribution, due to physical\r\nconditions, in an otherwise uninhabited waste is that wide dispersal of\r\na people in small detached groups which is the rule in lower stages of\r\nculture, and which bespeaks the necessity of relatively large\r\nterritorial reserves for the uneconomic method of land utilization\r\ncharacteristic of hunting, fishing, pastoral nomadism, and primitive\r\nagriculture. A distribution which claims large areas, without, however,\r\nmaintaining exclusive possession or complete occupation, indicates among\r\nadvanced peoples an unfinished process,[262] especially unfinished\r\nexpansion, such as marked the early French and English colonies in\r\nAmerica and the recent Russian occupation of Siberia. Among primitive\r\npeoples it is the normal condition, belongs to the stage of\r\ncivilization, not to any one land or any one race, though it has been\r\ncalled the American form of distribution.\r\n\r\nNot only are villages and encampments widely dispersed, but also the\r\ntribal territories. The Tupis were found by the Portuguese explorers\r\nalong the coast of eastern Brazil and in the interior from the mouth of\r\nthe La Plata to the lower Amazon, while two distant tribes of the Tupis\r\nwere dropped down amid a prevailing Arawak population far away among the\r\nfoothills of the Andes in two separate localities on the western\r\nAmazon.[263] [See map page 101.] The Athapascans, from their great\r\ncompact northern area between Hudson Bay, the Saskatchewan River, and\r\nthe Eskimo shores of the Arctic Ocean sent southward a detached offshoot\r\ncomprising the Navajos, Apaches and Lipans, who were found along the Rio\r\nGrande from its source almost to its mouth; and several smaller\r\nfragments westward who were scattered along the Pacific seaboard from\r\nPuget Sound to northern California.[264] The Cherokees of the southern\r\nAppalachians and the Tuscaroras of eastern North Carolina were detached\r\ngroups of the Iroquois, who had their chief seat about the lower Great\r\nLakes and the St. Lawrence. Virginia and North Carolina harbored also\r\nseveral tribes of Sioux,[265] who were also represented in southern\r\nMississippi by the small Biloxi nation, though the chief Sioux area lay\r\nbetween the Arkansas and Saskatchewan rivers. Similarly the Caddoes of\r\nLouisiana and eastern Texas had one remote offshoot on the Platte River\r\nand another, the Arikaras, on the upper Missouri near its great bend.\r\n[See map page 54.] But the territory of the Caddoes, in turn, was\r\nsprinkled with Choctaws, who belonged properly east of the Mississippi,\r\nbut who in 1803 were found scattered in fixed villages or wandering\r\ngroups near the Bayou Teche, on the Red River, the Washita, and the\r\nArkansas.[266] Their villages were frequently interspersed with others of\r\nthe Biloxi Sioux.\r\n\r\nThis fragmentary distribution appears in Africa among people in parallel\r\nstages of civilization. Dr. Junker found it as a universal phenomenon in\r\nCentral Africa along the watershed between the White Nile and the\r\nWelle-Congo. Here the territory of the dominant Zandeh harbored a motley\r\ncollection of shattered tribes, remnants of peoples, and intruding or\r\nrefugee colonies from neighboring districts.[267] The few weak bonds\r\nbetween people and soil characterizing retarded races are insufficient\r\nto secure permanent residence in the face of a diminished game supply,\r\nas in the case of the Choctaws above cited, or of political disturbance\r\nor oppression, or merely the desire for greater independence, as in that\r\nof so many African tribes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DISTRIBUTION OF POPULATION IN THE UNITED STATES IN 1800.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ethnic islands of expansion.]\r\n\r\nA scattered location results in all stages of civilization when an\r\nexpanding or intruding people begins to appropriate the territory of a\r\ndifferent race. Any long continued infiltration, whether peaceful or\r\naggressive, results in race islands or archipelagoes distributed through\r\na sea of aborigines. Semitic immigration from southern Arabia has in\r\nthis way striped and polka-dotted the surface of Hamitic Abyssinia.[268]\r\nGroups of pure German stock are to-day scattered through the Baltic and\r\nPolish provinces of Russia.[269] [See map page 223.] In ancient times the\r\nadvance guard of Teutonic migration crossed the Rhenish border of Gaul,\r\nselected choice sites here and there, after the manner of Ariovistus,\r\nand appeared as enclaves in the encompassing Gallic population. While\r\nthe Anahuac plateau of Mexico formed the center of the Aztec or Nahuatl\r\ngroup of Indians, outlying colonies of this stock occurred among the\r\nMaya people of the Tehuantepec region, and in Guatemala and\r\nNicaragua.[270]\r\n\r\nSuch detached fragments or rather spores of settlement characterize all\r\nyoung geographical boundaries, where ethnic and political frontiers are\r\nstill in the making. The early French, English, Dutch, and Swedish\r\nsettlements in America took the form of archipelagoes in a surrounding\r\nsea of Indian-owned forest land; and in 1800, beyond the frontier of\r\ncontinuous settlement in the United States long slender peninsulas and\r\nremote outlying islands of white occupation indicated American advance\r\nat the cost of the native. Similarly the Portuguese, at the end of the\r\nsixteenth century, seized and fortified detached points along the coast\r\nof East Africa at Sofala, Malindi, Mombassa, Kilwa, Lamu, Zanzibar and\r\nBarava, which served as way stations for Portuguese ships bound for\r\nIndia, and were outposts of expansion from their Moçambique\r\nterritory.[271] The snow-muffled forests of northern Siberia have their\r\nsolitudes broken at wide intervals by Russian villages, located only\r\nalong the streams for fishing, gold-washing and trading with the native.\r\nThese lonely clearings are outposts of the broad band of Muscovite\r\nsettlement which stretches across southern Siberia from the Ural\r\nMountains to the Angara River.[272] [See map page 103.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Political islands of expansion.]\r\n\r\nThe most exaggerated example of scattered political location existing\r\nto-day is found in the bizarre arrangement of European holdings on the\r\nwest coast of Africa between the Senegal and Congo rivers. Here in each\r\ncase a handful of governing whites is dropped down in the midst of a\r\ndark-skinned population in several districts along the coast. The six\r\ndetached seaboard colonies of the French run back in the interior into a\r\ncommon French-owned hinterland formed by the Sahara and western Sudan,\r\nwhich since 1894 link the Guinea Coast colonies with French Algeria and\r\nTunis; but the various British holdings have no territorial cohesion at\r\nany point, nor have the Spanish or Portuguese or German. The scattered\r\nlocation of these different European possessions is for the most part\r\nthe expression of a young colonizing activity, developed in the past\r\nfifty years, and signalized by the vigorous intrusion of the French and\r\nGermans into the field. To the anthropo-geographer the map of western\r\nAfrica presents the picture of a political situation wholly immature,\r\neven embryonic. The history of similar scattered outposts of political\r\nexpansion in America, India and South Africa teaches us to look for\r\nextensive consolidation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ethnic islands of survival.]\r\n\r\nRace islands occur also when a land is so inundated by a tide of\r\ninvasion or continuous colonization that the original inhabitants\r\nsurvive only as detached remnants, where protecting natural conditions,\r\nsuch as forests, jungles, mountains or swamps, provide an asylum, or\r\nwhere a sterile soil or rugged plateau has failed to attract the\r\ncupidity of the conqueror. The dismembered race, especially one in a\r\nlower status of civilization, can be recognized as such islands of\r\nsurvival by their divided distribution in less favored localities, into\r\nwhich they have fled, and in which seldom can they increase and\r\nrecombine to recover their lost heritage. In Central Africa, between the\r\nwatersheds of the Nile, Congo and Zambesi, there is scarcely a large\r\nnative state that does not shelter in its forests scattered groups of\r\ndwarf hunter folk variously known as Watwa, Batwa, and Akka.[273] They\r\nserve the agricultural tribes as auxiliaries in war, and trade with them\r\nin meat and ivory, but also rob their banana groves and manioc patches.\r\nThe local dispersion of these pygmies in small isolated groups among\r\nstronger peoples points to them as survivals of a once wide-spread\r\naboriginal race, another branch of which, as Schweinfurth suggested, is\r\nprobably found in the dwarfed Bushmen and Hottentots of South\r\nAfrica.[274] [See map page 105.]\r\n\r\nSimilar in distribution and in mode of life are the aborigines of the\r\nPhilippines, the dwarf Negritos, who are still found inhabiting the\r\nforests in various localities. They are dispersed through eight\r\nprovinces of Luzon and in several other islands, generally in the\r\ninterior, whither they have been driven by the invading Malays.[275] [See\r\nmap page 147.] But the Negritos crop out again in the mountain interior\r\nof Formosa and Borneo, in the eastern peninsula of Celebes, and in\r\nvarious islands of the Malay Archipelago as far east as Ceram and\r\nFlores, amid a prevailing Malay stock. Toward the west they come to the\r\nsurface in the central highland of Malacca, in the Nicobar and Andaman\r\nIslands, and in several mountain and jungle districts of India. Here\r\nagain is the typical geographic distribution of a moribund aboriginal\r\nrace, whose shrivelled patches merely dot the surface of their once wide\r\nterritory.[276] The aboriginal Kolarian tribes of India are found under\r\nthe names of Bhils, Kols and Santals scattered about in the fastnesses\r\nof the Central Indian jungles, the Vindhyan Range, and in the Rajputana\r\nDesert, within the area covered by Indo-Aryan occupation.[277] [See map\r\npage 103.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Discontinuous distribution.]\r\n\r\nSuch broad, intermittent dispersal is the anthropological prototype of\r\nthe \"discontinuous distribution\" of biologists. By this they mean that\r\ncertain types of plants and animals occur in widely separated regions,\r\nwithout the presence of any living representatives in the intermediate\r\narea. But they point to the rock records to show that the type once\r\noccupied the whole territory, till extensive elimination occurred, owing\r\nto changes in climatic or geologic conditions or to sharpened\r\ncompetition in the struggle for existence, with the result that the type\r\nsurvived only in detached localities offering a favorable\r\nenvironment.[278] In animal and plant life, the ice invasion of the\r\nGlacial Age explains most of these islands of survival; in human life,\r\nthe invasion of stronger peoples. The Finnish race, which in the ninth\r\ncentury covered nearly a third of European Russia, has been shattered by\r\nthe blows of Slav expansion into numerous fragments which lie scattered\r\nabout within the old ethnic boundary from the Arctic Ocean to the\r\nDon-Volga watershed.[279] The encroachments of the whites upon the red\r\nmen of America early resulted in their geographical dispersion. The map\r\nshowing the distribution of population in 1830 reveals large detached\r\nareas of Indian occupancy embedded in the prevailing white\r\nterritory.[280] The rapid compression of the tribal lands and the\r\nintroduction of the reservation system resulted in the present\r\narrangement of yet smaller and more widely scattered groups. Such\r\nislands of survival tend constantly to contract and diminish in number\r\nwith the growing progress, density, and land hunger of the surrounding\r\nrace. The Kaffir islands and the Hottentot \"locations\" in South Africa,\r\nlarge as they now are, will repeat the history of the American Indian\r\nlands, a history of gradual shrinkage and disappearance as territorial\r\nentities.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Contrasted location.]\r\n\r\nEvery land contains in close juxtaposition areas of sharply contrasted\r\ncultural, economic and political development, due to the influence of\r\ndiverse natural locations emphasizing lines of ethnic cleavage made\r\nperhaps by some great historical struggle. In mountainous countries the\r\nconquered people withdraw to the less accessible heights and leave the\r\nfertile valleys to the victorious intruders. The two races are thus held\r\napart, and the difference in their respective modes of life forced upon\r\nthem by contrasted geographic conditions tends still farther for a time\r\nto accentuate their diversity. The contrasted location of the dislodged\r\nAlpine race, surviving in all the mountains and highlands of western\r\nEurope over against the Teutonic victors settled in the plains,[281] has\r\nits parallel in many parts of Asia and Africa; it is almost always\r\ncoupled with a corresponding contrast in mode of life, which is at least\r\nin part geographically determined. In Algeria, the Arab conquerors, who\r\nform the larger part of the population, are found in the plains where\r\nthey live the life of nomads in their tents; the Berbers, who were the\r\noriginal inhabitants, driven back into the fastnesses of the Atlas\r\nranges, form now an industrious, sedentary farmer class, living in stone\r\nhouses, raising stock, and tilling their fields as if they were market\r\ngardeners.[282] In the Andean states of South America, the eastern slopes\r\nof the Cordilleras, which are densely forested owing to their position\r\nin the course of the trade-winds, harbor wild, nomadic tribes of hunting\r\nand fishing Indians who differ in stock and culture from the Inca\r\nIndians settled in the drier Andean basins.[283] [See map page 101.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Geographical polarity.]\r\n\r\nEvery geographical region of strongly marked character possesses a\r\ncertain polarity, by reason of which it attracts certain racial or\r\neconomic elements of population, and repels others. The predatory tribes\r\nof the desert are constantly reinforced by refugee outlaws from the\r\nsettled agricultural communities along its borders.[284] The mountains\r\nwhich offer a welcome asylum for the persecuted Waldenses have no lure\r\nfor the money-making Jew, who is therefore rarely found there. The\r\nnegroes of the United States are more and more congregating in the Gulf\r\nStates, making the \"Black Belt\" blacker. The fertile tidewater plains\r\nof ante-bellum Virginia and Maryland had a rich, aristocratic white\r\npopulation of slave-holding planters; the mountain backwoods of the\r\nAppalachian ranges, whose conditions of soil and relief were ill adapted\r\nfor slave cultivation, had attracted a poorer democratic farmer class,\r\nwho tilled their small holdings by their own labor and consequently\r\nentertained little sympathy for the social and economic system of the\r\ntidewater country. This is the contrast between mountain and plain which\r\nis as old as humanity. It presented problems to the legislation of\r\nSolon, and caused West Virginia to split off from the mother State\r\nduring the Civil War.[285]\r\n\r\nEach contrasted district has its own polarity; but with this it attracts\r\nnot one but many of the disruptive forces which are pent up in every\r\npeople or state. Certain conditions of climate, soil, and tillable area\r\nin the Southern States of the Union made slave labor remunerative, while\r\nopposite conditions in the North combined eventually to exclude it\r\nthence. Slave labor in the South brought with it in turn a whole train\r\nof social and economic consequences, notably the repulsion of foreign\r\nwhite immigration and the development of shiftless or wasteful\r\nindustrial methods, which further sharpened the contrast between the two\r\nsections. The same contrast occurs in Italian territory between Sicily\r\nand Lombardy. Here location at the two extremities of the peninsula has\r\ninvolved a striking difference in ethnic infusions in the two districts,\r\ndifferent historical careers owing to different vicinal grouping, and\r\ndissimilar geographic conditions. These effects operating together and\r\nattracting other minor elements of divergence, have conspired to\r\nemphasize the already strong contrast between northern and southern\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Geographical marks of growth.]\r\n\r\nIn geographical location can be read the signs of growth or decay. There\r\nare racial and national areas whose form is indicative of development,\r\nexpansion, while others show the symptoms of decline. The growing people\r\nseize all the geographic advantages within their reach, whether lying\r\ninside their boundaries or beyond. In the latter case, they promptly\r\nextend their frontiers to include the object of their desire, as the\r\nyoung United States did in the case of the Mississippi River and the\r\nGulf coast. European peoples, like the Russians in Asia, all strive to\r\nreach the sea; and when they have got there, they proceed to embrace as\r\nbig a strip of coast as possible. Therefore the whole colonization\r\nmovement of western and central Europe was in the earlier periods\r\nrestricted to coasts, although not to such an excessive degree as that\r\nof the Phoenicians and Greeks. Their own maritime location had\r\ninstructed them as to the value of seaboards, and at the same time made\r\nthis form of expansion the simplest and easiest.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marks of inland expansion.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, that growing people which finds its coastward advance\r\nblocked, and is therefore restricted to landward expansion, seizes upon\r\nevery natural feature that will aid its purpose. It utilizes every\r\nvalley highway and navigable river, as the Russians did in the case of\r\nthe Dnieper, Don, Volga, Kama and Northern Dwina in their radial\r\nexpansion from the Muscovite center at Moscow, and as later they used\r\nthe icy streams of Siberia in their progress toward the Pacific; or as\r\nthe Americans in their trans-continental advance used the Ohio,\r\nTennessee, the Great Lakes, and the Missouri. They reach out toward\r\nevery mountain pass leading to some choice ultramontane highway. Bulges\r\nor projecting angles of their frontier indicate the path they plan to\r\nfollow, and always include or aim at some natural feature which will\r\nfacilitate their territorial growth. The acquisition of the province of\r\nTicino in 1512 gave the Swiss Confederation a foothold upon Lake\r\nMaggiore, perhaps the most important waterway of northern Italy, and the\r\npossession of the Val Leventina, which now carries the St. Gotthard\r\nRailroad down to the plains of the Po. Every bulge of Russia's Asiatic\r\nfrontier, whether in the Trans-Caucasus toward the Mesopotamian basin\r\nand the Persian Gulf, or up the Murghab and Tedjend rivers toward the\r\ngates of Herat, is directed at some mountain pass and an outlet seaward\r\nbeyond.\r\n\r\nIf this process of growth bring a people to the borders of a desert,\r\nthere they halt perhaps for a time, but only, as it were, to take breath\r\nfor a stride across the sand to the nearest oasis. The ancient\r\nEgyptians advanced by a chain of oases--Siwa, Angila, Sella and Sokna,\r\nacross the Libyan Desert to the Syrtis Minor. The Russians in the last\r\ntwenty-five years have spread across the arid wastes of Turkestan by way\r\nof the fertile spots of Khiva, Bukhara and Merv to the irrigated slopes\r\nof the Hindu Kush and Tian Shan Mountains. The French extended the\r\nboundaries of Algiers southward into the desert to include the caravan\r\nroutes focusing at the great oases of Twat and Tidekelt, years before\r\ntheir recent appropriation of the western Sahara.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marks of decline.]\r\n\r\nAs territorial expansion is the mark of growth, so the sign of decline\r\nis the relinquishment of land that is valuable or necessary to a\r\npeople's well-being. The gradual retreat of the Tartars and in part also\r\nof the Kirghis tribes from their best pasture lands along the Volga into\r\nthe desert or steppes indicates their decrease of power, just as the\r\nwithdrawal of the Indians from their hunting grounds in forest and\r\nprairie was the beginning of their decay. Bolivia maimed herself for all\r\ntime when in 1884 she relinquished to Chile her one hundred and eighty\r\nmiles of coast between the Rio Lao and the twenty-fourth parallel. Her\r\nrepeated efforts later to recover at least one seaport on the Pacific\r\nindicate her own estimate of the loss by which she was limited to an\r\ninland location, and deprived of her maritime periphery.[286]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Interpretation of scattered and marginal location.]\r\n\r\nThe habits of a people and the consequent demands which they make upon\r\ntheir environment must be taken into account in judging whether or not a\r\nrestricted geographical location is indicative of a retrograde process.\r\nThe narrow marginal distribution of the Haida, Tlingit, and Tsimshean\r\nIndians on the islands and coastal strips of northwestern America means\r\nsimply the selection of sites most congenial to those inveterate fisher\r\ntribes. The fact that the English in the vicinity of the Newfoundland\r\nBanks settled on a narrow rim of coast in order to exploit the\r\nfisheries, while the French peasants penetrated into the interior\r\nforests and farmlands of Canada, was no sign of territorial decline.\r\nEnglish and French were both on the forward march, each in their own\r\nway. The scattered peripheral location of the Phoenician trading\r\nstations and later of the Greek colonies on the shores of the\r\nMediterranean was the expression of the trading and maritime activity of\r\nthose two peoples. Centuries later a similar distribution of Arab posts\r\nalong the coast of East Africa, Madagascar and the western islands of\r\nthe Sunda Archipelago indicated the great commercial expansion of the\r\nMohammedan traders of Oman and Yemen. The lack came when this\r\ndistribution, normal as a preliminary form, bore no fruit in the\r\noccupation of wide territorial bases. [See map page 251.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prevalence of ethnic islands of decline.]\r\n\r\nIn general, however, any piecemeal or marginal location of a people\r\njustifies the question as to whether it results from encroachment,\r\ndismemberment, and consequently national or racial decline. This\r\ninference as a rule strikes the truth. The abundance of such ethnic\r\nislands and reefs--some scarcely distinguishable above the flood of the\r\nsurrounding population--is due to the fact that when the area of\r\ndistribution of any life form, whether racial or merely animal, is for\r\nany cause reduced, it does not merely contract but breaks up into\r\ndetached fragments. These isolated groups often give the impression of\r\nbeing emigrants from the original home who, in some earlier period of\r\nexpansion, had occupied this outlying territory. At the dawn of western\r\nEuropean history, Gaul was the largest and most compact area of Celtic\r\nspeech. For this reason it has been regarded as the land whence sprang\r\nthe Celts of Britain, the Iberian Peninsula, the Alps and northern\r\nItaly. Freeman thinks that the Gauls of the Danube and Po valleys were\r\ndetachments which had been left behind in the great Celtic migration\r\ntoward the west;[287] but does not consider the possibility of a once far\r\nmore extensive Celtic area, which, as a matter of fact, once reached\r\neastward to the Weser River and the Sudetes Mountains and was later\r\ndismembered.[288] The islands of Celtic speech which now mark the western\r\nflank of Great Britain and Ireland are shrunken fragments of a Celtic\r\nlinguistic area which, as place-names indicate, once comprised the whole\r\ncountry.[289] Similarly, all over Russia Finnic place-names testify to\r\nthe former occupation of the country by a people now submerged by the\r\nimmigrant Slavs, except where they emerge in ethnic islands in the far\r\nnorth and about the elbow of the Volga.[290] [See map page 225.] Beyond\r\nthe compact area of the Melanesian race occupying New Guinea and the\r\nislands eastward to the Fiji and Loyalty groups, are found scattered\r\npatches of negroid folk far to the westward, relegated to the interiors\r\nof islands and peninsulas. The dispersed and fragmentary distribution of\r\nthis negroid stock has suggested that it formed the older and primitive\r\nrace of a wide region extending from India to Fiji and possibly even\r\nbeyond.[291]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Contrast between ethnic islands of growth and decline.]\r\n\r\nEthnic or political islands of decline can be distinguished from islands\r\nof expansion by various marks. When survivals of an inferior people,\r\nthey are generally characterized by inaccessible or unfavorable\r\ngeographic location. When remnants of former large colonial possessions\r\nof modern civilized nations, they are characterized by good or even\r\nexcellent location, but lack a big compact territory nearby to which\r\nthey stand in the relation of outpost. Such are the Portuguese fragments\r\non the west coast of India at Goa, Damaon, and Diu Island, and the\r\nPortuguese half of the island of Timor with the islet of Kambing in the\r\nEast Indies. Such also are the remnants of the French empire in India,\r\nfounded by the genius of François Dupleix, which are located on the\r\nseaboard at Chandarnagar, Carical, Pondicherry, Yanaon and Mahe. They\r\ntell the geographer a far different story from that of the small\r\ndetached French holding of Kwang-chan Bay and Nao-chan Island on the\r\nsouthern coast of China, which are outposts of the vigorous French\r\ncolony of Tongking.\r\n\r\nThe scattered islands of an intrusive people, bent upon conquest or\r\ncolonization, are distinguished by a choice of sites favorable to growth\r\nand consolidation, and by the rapid extension of their boundaries until\r\nthat consolidation is achieved; while the people themselves give signs\r\nof the rapid differentiation incident to adaptation to a new\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n[239] Anatole Leroy-Beaulieu, The Empire of the Tsars, Vol. I. pp.\r\n98-101.

Though some 8,000,000 square miles (21,000,000 square\r\nkilometers) about the poles remain unexplored, and only the twenty-eight\r\nper cent. of the total constituting the land area is the actual habitat\r\nof man, still the earth as a whole is his planet. Its surface fixes the\r\nlimits of his possible dwelling place, the range of his voyages and\r\nmigrations, the distribution of animals and plants on which he must\r\ndepend. These conditions he has shared with all forms of life from the\r\namoeba to the civilized nation. The earth's superficial area is the\r\nprimal and immutable condition of earth-born, earth-bound man; it is the\r\ncommon soil whence is sprung our common humanity. Nations belong to\r\ncountries and races to continents, but humanity belongs to the whole\r\nworld. Naught but the united forces of the whole earth could have\r\nproduced this single species of a single genus which we call Man.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Relation of area to life.]\r\n\r\nThe relation of life to the earth's area is a fundamental question of\r\nbio-geography. The amount of that area available for terrestrial life,\r\nthe proportion of land and water, the reduction or enlargement of the\r\navailable surface by the operation of great cosmic forces, all enter\r\ninto this problem, which changes from one geologic period to another.\r\nThe present limited plant life of the Arctic regions is the impoverished\r\nsuccessor of a vegetation abundant enough at the eighty-third parallel\r\nto produce coal. That was in the Genial Period, when the northern\r\nhemisphere with its broad land-masses presented a far larger area for\r\nthe support of life than to-day. Then the Glacial Period spread an\r\nice-sheet from the North Pole to approximately the fiftieth parallel,\r\nforced back life to the lower latitudes, and confined the bio-sphere to\r\nthe smaller land-masses of the southern hemisphere and a girdle north of\r\nthe equator. The sum total of life on the globe was greatly reduced at\r\nthe height of glaciation, and since the retreat of the ice has probably\r\nnever regained the abundance of the Middle Tertiary; so that our period\r\nis probably one of relative impoverishment and faulty adjustment both\r\nof life to life and of life to physical environment.[292] The continent of\r\nNorth America contained a small vital area during the Later Cretaceous\r\nPeriod, when a notable encroachment of the sea submerged the Atlantic\r\ncoastal plain, large sections of the Pacific coast, the Great Plains,\r\nTexas and the adjacent Gulf plain up the Mississippi Valley to the mouth\r\nof the Ohio.[293]\r\n\r\nThe task of estimating the area supporting terrestrial life which the\r\nearth presented at any given time is an important one, not only because\r\nthe amount of life depends upon this area, but because every increase of\r\navailable area tends to multiply conditions favorable to variation.\r\nDarwin shows that largeness of area, more than anything else, affords\r\nthe best conditions for rapid and improved variation through natural\r\nselection; because a large area supports a larger number of individuals\r\nin whom chance variations, advantageous in the struggle for existence,\r\nappear oftener than in a small group. This position is maintained also\r\nby the most recent evolutionists.[294]\r\n\r\nOn purely geographical grounds, also, a large area stimulates\r\ndifferentiation by presenting a greater diversity of natural conditions,\r\neach of which tends to produce its appropriate species or variety.[295]\r\nConsider the different environments found in a vast and varied continent\r\nlike Eurasia, which extends from the equator far beyond the Arctic\r\nCircle, as compared with a small land-mass like Australia, relatively\r\nmonotonous in its geographic conditions; and observe how much farther\r\nevolution has progressed in the one than in the other, in point of\r\nanimal forms, races and civilization. If we hold with Moritz Wagner and\r\nothers that isolation in naturally defined regions, alternating with\r\nperiods of migration, offers the necessary condition for the rapid\r\nevolution of type forms, and thus go farther than Darwin, who regards\r\nisolation merely as a fortunate contributory circumstance, we find that\r\nfor the evolution of mankind it is large areas like Eurasia which afford\r\nthe greatest number and variety of these naturally segregated habitats,\r\nand at the same time the best opportunity for vast historical movements.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The struggle for space.]\r\n\r\nEvolution needs room but finds the earth's surface limited. Everywhere\r\nold and new forms of life live side by side in deadly competition; but\r\nthe later improved variety multiplies and spreads at the cost of less\r\nfavored types. The struggle for existence means a struggle for space.[296]\r\nThis is true of man and the lower animals. A superior people, invading\r\nthe territory of its weaker savage neighbors, robs them of their land,\r\nforces them back into corners too small for their support, and continues\r\nto encroach even upon this meager possession, till the weaker finally\r\nloses the last remnant of its domain, is literally crowded off the\r\nearth, becomes extinct as the Tasmanians and so many Indian tribes have\r\ndone.[297] The superiority of such expansionists consists primarily in\r\ntheir greater ability to appropriate, thoroughly utilize and populate a\r\nterritory. Hence this is the faculty by which they hasten the extinction\r\nof the weaker; and since this superiority is peculiar to the higher\r\nstages of civilization, the higher stages inevitably supplant the lower.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Area an index of social and political development.]\r\n\r\nThe successive stages of social development--savage, pastoral nomadic,\r\nagricultural, and industrial--represent increasing density of\r\npopulation, increasing numerical strength of the social group, and\r\nfinally increasing geographical area, resulting in a vastly enlarged\r\nsocial group or state. Increase in the population of a given land is\r\naccompanied by a decrease in the share which each individual can claim\r\nas his own. This progressive readjustment to a smaller proportion of\r\nland brings in its train the evolution of all economic and social\r\nprocesses, reacting again favorably on density of population and\r\nresulting eventually in the greatly increased social group and enlarged\r\nterritory of the modern civilized state. Hence we may lay down the rule\r\nthat change in areal relations, both of the individual to his decreasing\r\nquota of land, and of the state to its increasing quota of the earth's\r\nsurface is an important index of social and political evolution.\r\nTherefore the rise and decline not only of peoples but of whole\r\ncivilizations have depended upon their relations to area. Therefore\r\nproblems of area, such as the expansion of a small territory, the\r\neconomic and political mastery of a large one, dominate all history.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Oikoumene.]\r\n\r\nHumanity's area of distribution and historical movement call the\r\nOikoumene. It forms a girdle around the earth between the two polar\r\nregions, and embraces the Tropics, the Temperate Zones, and a part of\r\nthe North Frigid, in all, five-sixths of the earth's surface. This area\r\nof distribution is unusually large. Few other living species so nearly\r\npermeate the whole vital area, and many of these have reached their wide\r\nexpansion only in the company of man. Only about 49,000,000 square miles\r\n(125,000,000 square kilometers) of the Oikoumene is land and therefore\r\nconstitutes properly the habitat of man. But just as we cannot\r\nunderstand a nation from the study of its own country alone, but must\r\ntake into consideration the wider area of its spreading activities, so\r\nwe cannot understand mankind without including in his world not only his\r\nhabitat but also the vastly larger sphere of his activities, which is\r\nalmost identical with the earth itself. The most progressive peoples\r\nto-day find their scientific, economic, religious and political\r\ninterests embracing the earth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Unity of the human species in the relation to the earth.]\r\n\r\nMankind has in common with all other forms of life the tendency toward\r\nexpansion. The more adaptable and mobile an organism is, the wider the\r\ndistribution which it attains and the greater the rapidity with which it\r\ndisplaces its weaker kin. In the most favored cases it embraces the\r\nwhole vital area of the earth, leaving no space free for the development\r\nof diversity of forms, and itself showing everywhere only superficial\r\ndistinctions. Mankind has achieved such wide distribution. Before his\r\npersistent intrusions and his mobility, the earth has no longer any\r\nreally segregated districts where a strongly divergent type of the man\r\nanimal might develop. Hence mankind shows only superficial distinctions\r\nof hair, color, head-form and stature between its different groups. It\r\nhas got beyond the point of forming species, and is restricted to the\r\nslighter variations of races. Even these are few in comparison with the\r\narea of the earth's surface, and their list tends to decrease. The\r\nGuanches and Tasmanians have vanished, the Australians are on the road\r\nto extinction; and when they shall have disappeared, there will be one\r\nvariety the less in humanity. So the process of assimilation advances,\r\nhere by the simple elimination of weaker divergent types of men, there\r\nby amalgamation and absorption into the stock of the stronger.\r\n\r\nThis unity of the human species has been achieved in spite of the fact\r\nthat, owing to the three-fold predominance of the water surface of the\r\nglobe, the land surface appears as detached fragments which rise as\r\nislands from the surrounding ocean. Among these fragments we have every\r\ngradation in size, from the continuous continental mass of\r\nEurasia-Africa with its 31,000,000 square miles, the Americas with\r\n15,000,000, Australia with nearly 3,000,000, Madagascar with 230,000,\r\nand New Zealand with 104,000, down to Guam with its 199 square miles,\r\nAscension with 58, Tristan da Cunha with 45, and the rocky Islet of\r\nHelgoland with its scant 150 acres. All these down to the smallest\r\nconstitute separate vital districts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Isolation and differentiation.]\r\n\r\nSmall, naturally defined areas, whether their boundaries are drawn by\r\nmountains, sea, or by both, always harbor small but markedly individual\r\npeoples, as also peculiar or endemic animal forms, whose differentiation\r\nvaries with the degree of isolation. Such peoples can be found over and\r\nover again in islands, peninsulas, confined mountain valleys, or\r\ndesert-rimmed oases. The cause lies in the barriers to expansion and to\r\naccessions of population from without which confront such peoples on\r\nevery side. Broad, uniform continental areas, on the other hand, where\r\nnature has erected no such obstacles are the habitats of wide-spread\r\npeoples, monotonous in type. The long stretch of coastal lowlands\r\nencircling the Arctic Ocean and running back into the wide plains of\r\nNorth America and Eurasia show a remarkable uniformity of animal and\r\nplant forms[298] and a striking similarity of race through the Lapps, the\r\nSamoyedes of northern Russia, the various Mongolian tribes of Arctic\r\nSiberia to Bering Strait, and the Eskimo, that curiously transitional\r\nrace, formerly classified as Mongolian and more recently as a divergent\r\nIndian stock; for the Eskimos are similar to the Siberians in stature,\r\nfeatures, coloring, mode of life, in everything but head-form, though\r\neven the cephalic indices approach on the opposite shores of Bering\r\nSea.[299] Where geography draws no dividing line, ethnology finds it\r\ndifficult to do so. Where the continental land-masses converge is found\r\nsimilarity or even identity of race, easy gradations from one type to\r\nanother; where they diverge most widely in the peninsular extremities of\r\nSouth America, South Africa and Australia, they show the greatest\r\ndissimilarity in their native races, and a corresponding diversity in\r\ntheir animal life.[300] Geographical proximity combined with accessibility\r\nresults in similarity of human and animal occupants, while a\r\ncorresponding dissimilarity is the attendant of remoteness or of\r\nsegregation. Therefore, despite the distribution of mankind over the\r\ntotal habitable area of the earth, his penetration into its detached\r\nregions and hidden corners has maintained such variations as still exist\r\nin the human family.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Monotonous race type of small area.]\r\n\r\nIf the distribution of the several races be examined in the light of\r\nthis conclusion, it becomes apparent that the races who have succeeded\r\nin appropriating only limited portions of the earth's surface, though\r\neach may be a marked variant of the human family, are characterized by\r\nfew inner diversities, either of physical features or culture. Their\r\nsubdivisions feel only in a slight degree the differentiating effects of\r\ngeographic remoteness, which in a small area operates with weakened\r\nforce; and they enjoy few of those diversities of environment which\r\nstimulate variation. They form close and distinct ethnic unities also\r\nbecause their scant numbers restrict the appearance of variations. The\r\nhabitat of the negro race in Africa south of the Sahara, relatively\r\nsmall, limited in its zonal location almost wholly to the Tropics,\r\npoorly diversified both in relief and contour, has produced only a\r\nretarded and monotonous social development based upon tropical\r\nagriculture or a low type of pastoral life. The still smaller, still\r\nless varied habitat of the Australian race, again tropical or\r\nsub-tropical in location, has produced over its whole extent only one\r\ngrade of civilization and that the lowest, one physical, mental and\r\nmoral type.[301]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wide race distribution and inner diversities.]\r\n\r\nThe Mongoloid area of distribution, on the other hand, is so large that\r\nit necessarily includes a great range of climates and variety of\r\ngeographic conditions. [Maps pages 103 and 225.] Representatives of this\r\nrace, reflecting their diversified habitats, show many ethnic\r\ndifferentiations. They reveal also every stage and phase of cultural\r\ndevelopment from the industrialism of Japan, with its artistic and\r\nliterary concomitants, to the savage economy and retarded intellectual\r\nlife of the Chukches fisher tribes or the Giljak hunters of Sakhalin.\r\nThe white race, identified primarily with Europe, that choice and\r\ndiversified continent, comprised also a large area of southwestern Asia\r\nand the northern third of Africa. It thus extended from the Arctic\r\nCircle well within the Tropics. Its area included every variety of\r\ngeographic condition and originally every degree of cultural\r\ndevelopment; but the rapid expansion in recent centuries of the most\r\nadvanced peoples of this race has made them the apostles of civilization\r\nto the whole world. It has also given them, through the occupation of\r\nAustralia and the Americas, the widest distribution and the most varied\r\nhabitats. As agents of the modern historical movement, however, they are\r\nsubjected to all its assimilating effects, which tend to counteract the\r\ndiversities born of geographic segregation, and to raise all branches of\r\nthe white race to one superior cosmopolitan type. On the other hand, the\r\nvast international division of labor and specialization of production,\r\ngeographically based and entailed by advancing economic development,\r\nbesides the differences of traditions and ideals reaching far back into\r\nan historic past and rooted in the land, will serve to maintain many\r\nsubtle inner differences between even the most progressive nations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Area and language.]\r\n\r\nHence the wide area which Darwin found to be most favorable to\r\nimproved variation and rapid evolution in animals, operates to the\r\nsame end in human development, and its influence becomes a law of\r\nanthropo-geography. It permeates the higher aspects of life. The wide,\r\nvaried area occupied by the Germanic tribes of Europe permitted the\r\nevolution of the many dialects which finally made the richness of\r\nmodern German speech. English has gained in vocabulary and idiom with\r\nevery expansion of its area. New territories mean to a people new\r\npursuits, new relations, new wants; and all these become reflected in\r\ntheir speech. Languages, like peoples, cease to grow with national\r\nstagnation.[302] To such stagnation movement or expansion is the\r\nsurest antidote. America will in time make its contribution to the\r\nEnglish tongue. The rich crop of slang that springs up on the frontier\r\nis not wholly to be deplored. The crudeness and vigor of cowboy speech\r\nare marks of youth: they are also promises of growth. Language can not\r\nlive by dictionary alone. It tends to form new variants with every\r\nchange of habitat. The French of the Canadian _habitant_ has absorbed\r\nIndian and English words, and adapted old terms to new uses;[303] but\r\nit is otherwise a survival of seventeenth century French. Boer speech\r\nin South Africa shows the same thing--absorption of new Kaffir and\r\nEnglish words, coupled with marks of retardation due to isolation.\r\nReligion in the same way gains by wide dispersal. Christianity is one\r\nthing in St. Petersburg, another among the Copts of Cairo, another in\r\nRome, another in London, and yet another in Boston. Buddhism takes on\r\na different color in Ceylon, Tibet, China and Japan. In religion as in\r\nother phases of human development, differentiation must mean eventual\r\nenrichment, a larger content of the religious idea, to which each\r\nfaith makes its contribution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Large area a guarantee of racial or national permanence.]\r\n\r\nThe larger the area occupied by a race or people, other geographic\r\nconditions being equal, the surer the guarantee of their permanence, and\r\nthe less the chance of their repression or annihilation. A broad\r\ngeographic base means generally abundant command of the resources of\r\nlife and growth. Though for a growing people of wide possessions, like\r\nthe Russians, the significance of the land may not be obvious, it\r\nbecomes apparent enough in national decline and decay; for these even in\r\ntheir incipiency betray themselves in a loss of territory. A people\r\nwhich, voluntarily or otherwise, renounces its hold upon its land is on\r\nthe downward path. Nothing else could show so plainly the national\r\nvitality of Japan as her tenacious purpose to get back Port Arthur taken\r\nfrom her by the Shimonoseki treaty in 1895. A people may decrease in\r\nnumbers without serious consequences if it still retains its land; for\r\nherein lies its resources by which it may again hope to grow. The\r\nrecurring loss of millions of lives in China from the wide-sweeping\r\nfloods of the Hoangho is a passing episode, forgotten as soon as the\r\nmighty stream is re-embanked and the flooded plains reclaimed. The\r\nCivil War in the United States involved a temporary diminution of\r\npopulation and check to progress, but no lasting national weakness\r\nbecause no loss of territory. But the expulsion of the American Indians\r\nfrom their well-stocked hunting grounds in the Mississippi Valley and\r\nAtlantic plain to more restricted and barren lands in the far West, and\r\nthe withdrawal of the Australian natives from the fertile coasts to the\r\ndesert interior have meant racial renunciation of the sources of life.\r\n\r\nHence a people who are conquered and dislodged from their territory, as\r\nwere the ancient Britons by the Saxons, the Slavs from the land between\r\nthe Elbe and the Niemen by the mediæval Germans, and the Kaffirs in\r\nSouth Africa by the Dutch and English, the Ainos from Hondo by the\r\nJapanese, and the whole original Alpine race by the later coming Teutons\r\nfrom the fertile valleys and plains into the more barren highlands of\r\nwestern Europe, have little or no chance of regaining their own. When\r\nconquest results not in dislodgement, but only in the subjection of an\r\nundisturbed native population to a new ruling class, the vanquished\r\nretain their hold, only slightly impaired, perhaps, upon their\r\nstrength-giving fields, recover themselves, and sooner or later conquer\r\ntheir conquerors either by absorption or revolution. This was the\r\nhistory of ancient Egypt with its Shepherd Kings, of England with its\r\nNorman lords, of Mexico and Peru with their Spanish victors.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Weakness of small states.]\r\n\r\nA large area throws around all the life forms which it supports the\r\nprotection of its mere distances, which facilitate defense in\r\ncompetition with other forms, render attack difficult, and afford room\r\nfor retreat under pursuit. On the other hand, the small area is easily\r\ncompassed by the invaders, and its inhabitants soon brought to bay.\r\nSince there is a general correspondence between size of area and number\r\nof inhabitants, where physical conditions and economic development are\r\nsimilar, a small area involves a further handicap of numerical weakness\r\nof population. Greece has always suffered from the small size of the\r\npeninsula and the further political dismemberment entailed by its\r\ngeographic subdivisions. Despite superior civilization and national\r\nheroism, it has fallen a victim to almost every invader. Belgium,\r\nHolland, Switzerland exist as distinct nations only on sufferance.\r\nFinland's history since 1900 shows that the day for the national\r\nexistence of small peoples is passing.[304] The fragmentary political\r\ngeography of the Danube basin gives the geographer the impression of an\r\nartist's crayon studies of details, destined later to be incorporated in\r\na finished picture. Their small areas promise short-lived autonomy. The\r\nrecent absorption of Bosnia and Herzegovina by Austria indicates the\r\ndestiny of these Danubian states as fixed by the law of increasing\r\nterritorial aggregates.\r\n\r\nWhat is true of states is true also of peoples. The extinction of the\r\nretarded \"provisional peoples\" of the earth progresses more rapidly in\r\nsmall groups than in large, and in small islands more quickly than in\r\ncontinental areas. Of the twenty-one Indian stocks or families which\r\nhave died out in the United States, fifteen belonged to the small bands\r\nonce found in the Pacific coast states, and four more were similar\r\nfragments found on the lower Mississippi and its bayous.[305] [See map\r\npage 54.] The native Gaunches of Teneriffe Island disappeared long ago.\r\nThe last Tasmanian died in 1876. New Zealand, whose area is four times\r\nthat of Tasmania, and therefore gives some respite before the\r\nencroachments of the whites, still harbors 47,835 Maoris, or little over\r\none-third the native population of the island in 1840.[306] But these\r\ncompete for the land with nearly one million English colonists, and in\r\nthe limited area of the islands they will eventually find no place of\r\nretreat before the relentless white advance.\r\n\r\nTo the Australians, on the other hand, much inferior to the Maoris, the\r\nlarger area of their continent affords extensive deserts and steppes\r\ninto which the natives have withdrawn and whither the whites do not care\r\nto follow. Hence mere area, robbed of every other favorable geographical\r\ncircumstance, has contributed to the survival of the 230,000 natives in\r\nAustralia. Similarly the Arawaks were early wiped out on the island of\r\nCuba and the Caribs on San Domingo and the smaller Antilles by the\r\ntruculent methods of the Spanish conquerors, while both stocks survive\r\non the continent of South America. Even the truculent methods of the\r\nSpanish conquerors could make little impression upon the relatively\r\nmassive populations of Mexico and Peru, whose survival and latter-day\r\nrecovery of independence can be ascribed largely though not solely to\r\ntheir ample territorial base. So the vast area of the United States and\r\nCanada has afforded a hinterland of asylum to the retreating Indians,\r\nwhose moribund condition, especially in the United States, is betrayed\r\nby their scattered distribution in small, unfavorable localities. On the\r\nother hand, the vast extent of Arctic and sub-Arctic Canada, combined\r\nwith the adverse climatic conditions of the region, will guarantee the\r\nnorthern Indians a longer survival. In Tierra del Fuego, the\r\nencroachments of sheep-farmers and gold-miners from Patagonia twenty\r\nyears ago, by fencing off the land and killing off the wild guanaco,\r\nthreatened the existence of this animal and of the Onas natives of the\r\nisland. These, soon brought to bay in that natural enclosure, attacked\r\nthe farmers, whose reprisals between 1890 and 1900 reduced the number of\r\nthe Onas from 2,000 to 800 souls.[307]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Contrast of large and small areas in bio-geography.]\r\n\r\nThe same law holds good in bio-geography; here, too, area gives strength\r\nand a small territorial foothold means weakness. The native flora and\r\nfauna of New Zealand seem involved in the same process of extinction as\r\nthe native race. The Maoris themselves have observed this fact and\r\napplied the principle to their own obvious fate. They have seen hardy\r\nimported English grasses offering deadly competition to the indigenous\r\nvegetation; the Norway rat, entering by European ships, extirpating the\r\nnative variety; the European house fly, purposely imported and\r\ndistributed to destroy the noxious indigenous species.[308] The same\r\nunequal combat between imported plants and animals, equipped by the\r\nfierce Iliads of continental areas, and the local flora and fauna has\r\ntaken place on the little island of St. Helena, to the threatened\r\ndestruction of the native forms.[309]\r\n\r\nThe preponderant migration of animals from the northern to the southern\r\nhemisphere is attributed by Darwin to the greater extent of land in the\r\nnorth, whereby the northern types have existed in greater numbers and\r\nhave been so perfected through natural selection and competition, that\r\nthey have surpassed the southern forms in dominating power and therefore\r\nhave encroached successfully.[310] Also the races and nations of the\r\nnorthern continents have seriously invaded the southern land-masses and\r\nare still expanding. It is the largest continent, Eurasia, which has\r\nbeen the chief center of dispersal.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Political domination of large areas.]\r\n\r\nThe Temperate Zone of North America will always harbor a more powerful\r\npeople than the corresponding zone of South America, because the latter\r\ncontinent begins to contract and tapers off to a point where the other\r\nat the northern Tropic begins to spread out. Therefore North America\r\npossesses more abundantly all the advantages accruing to a continent\r\nfrom a location in the Temperate Zone. The wide basis of the North Slavs\r\nin Russia and Siberia has given them a natural leadership in the whole\r\nSlav family, just as the broad unbroken area of ever expanding Prussia\r\ngave that state the ascendency in the German Empire over the\r\ngeographically partitioned and politically dismembered surface of\r\nsouthern Germany. English domination of the United Kingdom is based not\r\nonly upon race, location, geographical features and resources, but also\r\non the larger size of England. So in the United States, abolitionist\r\nstatesmen adopted the most effective means of fighting slavery when they\r\nlimited its area by law, while permitting free states to go on\r\nmultiplying in the new territory of the vast Northwest.\r\n\r\nIn a peninsula political ascendency often falls to the broad base\r\nconnecting it with the continent, because this part alone has the area\r\nto support a large population, and moreover commands a large hinterland,\r\nwhence it continually draws new and invigorating blood. The geographical\r\nbasis of the Aryan and later the Mongol supremacy in India was the wide\r\nzone of lowlands between the Indus and the Brahmaputra. [See map page\r\n103.] The only ancient Greek state ever able to dominate the Balkan\r\nPeninsula was non-Hellenic Macedonia, after it had extended its\r\nboundaries to the Euxine and the Adriatic. To-day a much larger area in\r\nthis same peninsular base harbors the widespread southern Slavs, who\r\nnumerically and economically far outweigh Albanians and Greeks, and who\r\ncould with ease achieve political domination over the small Turkish\r\nminority, were it not for the European fear of a Slavic Bosporus, and\r\nits union with Russia. The Cisalpine Gauls of the wide Po basin\r\nrepeatedly threatened the existence of the smaller but more civilized\r\nEtruscan and Latin tribes. The latter, maturing their civilization under\r\nthe concentrating influences of a limited area, at last dominated the\r\nlarger Celtic district to the north. But in the nineteenth century this\r\ndistrict took the lead in the movement for a United Italy, and now\r\nexercises the strong influence in Italian affairs which belongs to it by\r\nreason of its superior area, location, and more vigorous race. [See map\r\nof Italy's population, Chap. XVI.]\r\n\r\nThe broad territorial base of the Anglo-Saxon race, Slavs, Germans and\r\nChinese promises a long ethnic life, whereas the narrow foothold, of the\r\nDanes, Dutch, Greeks, and the Turks in Europe carries with it the\r\npersistent risk of conquest and absorption by a larger neighbor. Such a\r\nfate repeatedly threatens these people, but has thus far been warded\r\noff, now by the protection of an isolating environment, now by the\r\ndiplomatic intervention of some not disinterested power. The scattered\r\nfragments of Osman stock in European Turkey, which constitute only about\r\nten per cent. of the total population, and are almost lost in the\r\nsurrounding mass of Slavs and Greeks, provide a poor guarantee for the\r\nduration of the race and their empire on European soil. On the other\r\nhand, the Osmani who are compactly spread over the whole interior of\r\nAsia Minor have a better prospect of national survival.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Area and literature.]\r\n\r\nAn important factor in the preservation of national consciousness and\r\nthe spread of national influence is always a national language and\r\nliterature. This principle is recognized by the government of the Czar\r\nin its Russification of Finland,[311] Poland, and the German centers in\r\nthe Baltic provinces, when it substitutes Russian for the local language\r\nin education, law courts and all public offices, and restricts the\r\npublication of local literature. The survival of a language and its\r\nliterature is intimately connected with area and the population which\r\nthat area can support. The extinction of small, weak peoples has its\r\ncounterpart in the gradual elimination of dialects and languages having\r\nrestricted territorial sway, whose fate is foreshadowed by the unequal\r\ncompetition of their literatures with those of numerically stronger\r\npeoples. An author writing in a language like the Danish, intelligible\r\nto only a small public, can expect only small returns for his labor in\r\neither influence, fame, or fortune. The return may be so small that it\r\nis prohibitive. Hence we find the Danish Hans Christian Andersen and the\r\nNorwegian Ibsen writing in German, as do also many Scandinavian\r\nscientists. Georg Brandes abandons his native Danish and seeks a larger\r\npublic by making English the language of his books. The incentive to\r\nfollow a literary career, especially if it includes making a living, is\r\nrelatively weak among a people of only two or three millions, but gains\r\nenormously among large and cultivated peoples, like the seventy million\r\nGerman-speaking folk of Europe, or the one hundred and thirty millions\r\nof English speech scattered over the world. The common literature which\r\nrepresents the response to this incentive forms a bond of union among\r\nthe various branches of these peoples, and may be eventually productive\r\nof political results.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Small geographic base of primitive societies.]\r\n\r\nGrowth has been the law of human societies since the birth of man's\r\ngregarious instinct. It has manifested itself in the formation of ever\r\nlarger social groups, appropriating ever larger areas. It has registered\r\nitself geographically in the protrusion of ethnic boundaries,\r\neconomically in more intensive utilization of the land, socially in\r\nincreasing density of population, and politically in the formation of\r\never larger national territorial aggregates. The lowest stages of\r\nculture reveal small tribes, growing very slowly or at times not at all,\r\ndisseminated over areas small in themselves but large for the number of\r\ntheir inhabitants, hence sparsely populated. The size of these primitive\r\nholdings depends upon the natural food supply yielded by the region.\r\nThey assume wide dimensions but support groups of only a few families on\r\nthe chill rocky coasts of Tierra del Fuego or the sterile plains of\r\ncentral Australia; and they contract to smaller areas dotted with fairly\r\npopulous villages in the fertile districts of the middle Congo or\r\nbordering the rich coast fishing grounds of southern Alaska and British\r\nColumbia. But always land is abundant, and is drawn upon in widening\r\ncircles when the food supply becomes inadequate or precarious.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Influence of small confined areas.]\r\n\r\nWhere nature presents barriers to far-ranging food-quests, man is forced\r\nto advance from the natural to the artificial basis of subsistence; he\r\nleaves the chase for the sedentary life of agriculture. Extensive\r\nactivities are replaced by intensive ones, wide dispersal of tribal\r\nenergies by concentration. The extensive forests and grassy plains of\r\nthe Americas supported abundant animal life and therefore afforded\r\nconditions for the long survival of the hunting tribes; nature put no\r\npressure upon man to coerce him to progress, except in the small\r\nmountain-walled valleys of Peru and Mexico, and in the restricted\r\ndistricts of isthmian Central America. Here game was soon exhausted.\r\nAgriculture became an increasing source of subsistence and was forced by\r\nlimited area out of its migratory or _essartage_ stage of development\r\ninto the sedentary. As fields become fixed in such enclosed areas, so do\r\nthe cultivators. Here first population becomes relatively dense, and\r\nthereby necessitates more elaborate social and political organization in\r\norder to prevent inner friction.\r\n\r\nThe geographically enclosed district has the further advantage that its\r\ninhabitants soon come to know it out to its boundaries, understand its\r\npossibilities, exploit to the utmost its resources, and because of the\r\ncloseness of their relationship to it and to each other come to develop\r\na conscious national spirit. The population, since it cannot easily\r\nspread beyond the nature-set limits, increases in density. The members\r\nof the compact society react constantly upon one another and exchange\r\nthe elements of civilization. Thus the small territory is characterized\r\nby the early maturity of a highly individualized civilization, which\r\nthen, with inherent power of expansion, proceeds to overleap its narrow\r\nborders and conquer for itself a wide sphere of influence. Hand in hand\r\nwith this process goes political concentration, which aids the\r\nsubsequent expansion. Therefore islands, oases, slender coastal strips\r\nand mountain valleys repeatedly show us small peoples who, in their\r\nseclusion, have developed a tribal or national consciousness akin in\r\nits intensity to clan feeling. This national feeling is conspicuous in\r\nthe English, Japanese, Swiss and Dutch, as it was in the ancient\r\ncity-states of Greece. The accompanying civilization, once brought to\r\nmaturity in its narrow breeding place, spreads under favorable\r\ngeographic conditions over a much larger space, which the accumulated\r\nrace energy takes for its field of activity. The flower which thus early\r\nblooms may soon fade and decay; nevertheless the geographically evolved\r\nnational consciousness persists and retains a certain power of renewal.\r\nThis has been demonstrated in the Italians and modern Greeks, in the\r\nDanes and the Icelanders. In the Jews it has resisted exile from their\r\nnative land, complete political dissolution, and dispersal over the\r\nhabitable world. Long and often as Italy had to submit to foreign\r\ndominion, the idea of the national unity of the peninsula was never\r\nlost.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The process of territorial growth.]\r\n\r\nIn vast unobstructed territories, on the other hand, the evil of wide,\r\nsparse dispersal is checked only by natural increase of population and\r\nthe impinging of one growing people upon another, which restricts the\r\nterritory of either. When the boundary waste between the small scattered\r\ntribal groups has been occupied, encroachment from the side of the\r\nstronger follows; then comes war, incorporation of territory,\r\namalgamation of race and coalescence, or the extinction of the weaker.\r\nThe larger people, commanding its larger area, expands numerically and\r\nterritorially, and continues to throw out wider frontiers, till it meets\r\ninsurmountable natural obstacles or the confines of a people strong as\r\nitself. After a pause, during which the existing area is outgrown and\r\npopulation begins to press harder upon the limits of subsistence, the\r\nweight of a nation is thrown against the barrier, be it physical or\r\npolitical. In consequence, the old boundaries are enlarged, either by\r\nsuccessful encroachment upon a neighbor, or, in case of defeat, by\r\nincorporation in the antagonist's territory. But even defeat brings\r\nparticipation in a larger geographic base, wider coöperation, a greater\r\nsum total of common national interests, and especially the protection of\r\nthe larger social group. The Transvaal and the Orange Free State find\r\ncompensation for the loss of independence by their incorporation in the\r\nBritish Empire, even if gradual absorption be the destiny of the Boer\r\nstock.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Area and growth.]\r\n\r\nOf adjacent areas equally advanced in civilization and in density of\r\npopulation but of unequal size, the larger must dominate because its\r\npeople have the resistance and aggressive force inherent in the larger\r\nmass. This is the explanation of the absorption of so many colonies and\r\nconquerors by the native races, when no great cultural abyss or race\r\nantagonism separates the two. The long rule of the Scandinavians in the\r\nHebrides ended in their absorption by the local Gaelic stock, simply\r\nbecause their settlements were too small and the number of their women\r\ntoo few. The lowlands on the eastern coasts of Scotland accommodated\r\nlarger bands of Norse, who even to-day can be distinguished from the\r\nneighboring Scotch of the Highlands; but on the rugged western coast,\r\nwhere only small and widely separated deltas at the heads of the fiords\r\noffered a narrow foothold to the invaders, their scattered ethnic\r\nislands were soon inundated by the contiguous population.[312] The\r\nTeutonic elements, both English and Norwegian, which for centuries\r\nfiltered into Ireland, have been swallowed up in the native Celtic\r\nstock, except where religious antagonisms served to keep the two apart.\r\nSo the dominant Anglo-Saxon population of England was a solvent for the\r\nNorman French, and the densely packed humanity of China for their Manchu\r\nconquerors.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, extensive areas, like early North America and\r\nAustralia, sparsely inhabited by small scattered groups who have only an\r\nattenuated connection with their soil and therefore only a feeble hold\r\nupon their land, cannot compete with small areas, if these have the\r\ndense and evenly distributed population which ensures a firm tenure of\r\nthe land. Small, geographically confined areas foster this compact and\r\nsystematic occupation on the part of their inhabitants, since they put\r\nbarriers in the way of precipitate and disintegrating expansion; and\r\nthis characteristic compensates in some degree and for a period at least\r\nfor the weakness otherwise inherent in the narrow territorial base.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Historical advance from small to large areas.]\r\n\r\nEvery race, people, and state has had the history of progress from a\r\nsmall to a large area. All have been small in their youth. The bit of\r\nland covered by Roma Quadrata has given language, customs, laws,\r\nculture, and a faint strain of Latin blood to nations now occupying half\r\na million square miles of Europe. The Arab inundation, which flooded the\r\nvast domain of the Caliphs, traced back to that spring of ethnic and\r\nreligious energy which welled up in the arid plain of Mecca and the\r\nArabian oases. The world-wide maritime expansion of the English-speaking\r\npeople had its starting point in the lowlands of the Elbe. The makers of\r\nempire in northern China were cradled in the small highland valley of\r\nthe Wei River. The little principality of Moscow was the nucleus of the\r\nRussian Empire.\r\n\r\nPenetration into a people's remote past comes always upon some limited\r\nspot which has nurtured the young nation, and reveals the fact that\r\nterritorial expansion is the incontestible feature of their history.\r\nThis advance from small to large characterizes their political area, the\r\nscope of their trade relations, their spheres of activity, the size of\r\ntheir known world, and finally the sway of their religions. Every\r\nreligion in its early stages of development bears the stamp of a narrow\r\norigin, traceable to the circumscribed habitat of the primitive social\r\ngroup, or back of that to the small circle of lands constituting the\r\nknown world whence it sprang. First it is tribal, and makes a\r\ndistinction between my God and thy God; but even when it has expanded to\r\nembody a universal system, it still retains vestigial forms of its\r\nnarrow past. Jerusalem, Mecca and Rome remain the sacred goal of\r\npilgrimages, while the vaster import of a monotheistic faith and the\r\nhigher ethical teaching of the brotherhood of man have encircled the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nWhen religion, language and race have spread, in their wake comes the\r\ngrowing state. Everywhere the political area tends gradually to embrace\r\nthe whole linguistic area of which it forms a part, and finally the yet\r\nlarger race area. Only the diplomacy of united Europe has availed to\r\nprevent France from absorbing French-speaking Belgium, or Russia from\r\nincorporating into her domain that vast Slav region extending from the\r\nDrave and Danube almost to the Gulf of Corinth, now parcelled out among\r\nseven different states, but bound to the Muscovite empire by ties of\r\nrelated speech, by race and religion. The detachment of the various\r\nDanubian principalities from the uncongenial dominion of the Turks,\r\nthough a dismemberment of a large political territory and a seeming\r\nbackward step, can be regarded only as a leisurely preliminary for a new\r\nterritorial alignment. History's movements are unhurried; the backward\r\nstep may prepare for the longer leap forward. It is impossible to resist\r\nthe conclusion that the vigorous, reorganized German Empire will one day\r\ntry to incorporate the Germanic areas found in Austria, Switzerland and\r\nHolland.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gradations in area and in development.]\r\n\r\nThroughout the life of any people, from its foetal period in some small\r\nlocality to its well rounded adult era marked by the occupation and\r\norganization of a wide national territory, gradations in area mark\r\ngradations of development. And this is true whether we consider the\r\ncompass of their commercial exchanges, the scope of their maritime\r\nventures, the extent of their linguistic area, the measure of their\r\nterritorial ambitions, or the range of their intellectual interests and\r\nhuman sympathies. From land to ethics, the rule holds good. Peoples in\r\nthe lower stages of civilization have contracted spacial ideas, desire\r\nand need at a given time only a limited territory, though they may\r\nchange that territory often; they think in small linear terms, have a\r\nsmall horizon, a small circle of contact with others, a small range of\r\ninfluence, only tribal sympathies; they have an exaggerated conception\r\nof their own size and importance, because their basis of comparison is\r\nfatally limited. With a mature, widespread people like the English or\r\nFrench, all this is different; they have made the earth their own, so\r\nfar as possible.\r\n\r\nJust because of this universal tendency towards the occupation of ever\r\nlarger areas and the formation of vaster political aggregates, in making\r\na sociological or political estimate of different peoples, we should\r\nnever lose sight of the fact that all racial and national\r\ncharacteristics which operate towards the absorption of more land and\r\nimpel to political expansion are of fundamental value. A ship of state\r\nmanned by such a crew has its sails set to catch the winds of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Preliminaries to ethnic and political expansion.]\r\n\r\nTerritorial expansion is always preceded by an extension of the circle\r\nof influence which a people exerts through its traders, its deep-sea\r\nfishermen, its picturesque marauders and more respectable missionaries,\r\nand earlier still by a widening of its mere geographical horizon through\r\nfortuitous or systematic exploration. The Northmen visited the coasts of\r\nBritain and France first as pirates, then as settlers. Norman and Breton\r\nfishermen were drawing in their nets on the Grand Bank of Newfoundland\r\nthirty years before Cartier sailed up the St. Lawrence. Japanese fishing\r\nboats preceded Japanese colonists to the coasts of Yezo. Trading fleets\r\nwere the forerunners of the Greek colonies along the Black Sea and\r\nMediterranean, and of Phoenician settlements in North Africa, Sicily and\r\nSpain. It was in the wake of trapper and fur trader that English and\r\nAmerican pioneer advanced across our continent to the Pacific; just as\r\nin French Canada Jesuit priest and voyageur opened the way for the\r\nsettler. Religious propaganda was yoked with greed of conquest in the\r\ncampaigns of Cortez and Pizarro. Modern statesmen pushing a policy of\r\nexpansion are alive to the diplomatic possibilities of missionaries\r\nendangered or their property destroyed. They find a still better asset\r\nto be realized on territorially in enterprising capitalists settled\r\namong a weaker people, by whom their property is threatened or\r\novertaxed, or their trade interfered with. The British acquisition of\r\nHongkong in 1842 followed a war with China to prevent the exclusion of\r\nthe English opium trade from the Celestial Empire. The annexation of the\r\nTransvaal resulted from the expansion of English capitalists to the Rand\r\nmines, much as the advance of the United States flag to the Hawaiian\r\nIslands followed American sugar planters thither. American capital in\r\nthe Caribbean states of South America has repeatedly tried to embroil\r\nthose countries with the United States government; and its increasing\r\npresence in Cuba is undoubtedly ominous for the independence of the\r\nisland, because with capital go men and influence.\r\n\r\nWhen the foreign investor is not a corporation but a government, the\r\nexpanding commercial influence looks still more surely to tangible\r\npolitical results; because such national enterprises have at bottom a\r\npolitical motive, however much overlaid by an economic exterior. When\r\nthe British government secured a working majority of the Suez Canal\r\nstock, it sealed the fate of Egypt to become ultimately a province of\r\nthe British Empire. Russian railroads in Manchuria were the\r\nwell-selected tool for the Russification and final annexation of the\r\nprovince. The weight of American national enterprise in the Panama Canal\r\nZone sufficed to split off from the Colombian federation a peripheral\r\nstate, whose detachment is obviously a preliminary for eventual\r\nincorporation into United States domain. The efforts of the German\r\ngovernment to secure from the Sultan of Turkey railroad concessions\r\nthrough Asia Minor for German capitalists has aroused jealousy in\r\nfinancial and political circles in St. Petersburg, and prompted a demand\r\nfrom the Russian Foreign Office upon Turkey for the privilege of\r\nconstructing railroads through eastern Asia Minor.[313]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Significance of sphere of activity or influence.]\r\n\r\nBeyond the home of a people lies its sphere of influence or activities,\r\nwhich in the last analysis may be taken as a protest against the\r\nnarrowness of the domestic habitat. It represents the larger area which\r\nthe people wants and which in course of time it might advantageously\r\noccupy or annex. It embodies the effort to embrace more varied and\r\ngenerous natural conditions, whereby the struggle for subsistence may be\r\nmade less hard. Finally, it is an expression of the law that for peoples\r\nand races the struggle for existence is at bottom a struggle for space.\r\nGeography sees various forms of the historical movement as the struggle\r\nfor space in which humanity has forever been engaged. In this struggle\r\nthe stronger peoples have absorbed ever larger portions of the earth's\r\nsurface. Hence, through continual subjection to new conditions here or\r\nthere and to a greater sum total of various conditions, they gain in\r\npower by improved variation, as well as numerically by the enlargement\r\nof their geographic base. The Anglo-Saxon branch of the Teutonic stock\r\nhas, by its phenomenal increase, overspread sections of whole\r\ncontinents, drawn from their varied soils nourishment for its finest\r\nefflorescence, and thereby has far out-grown the Germanic branch by\r\nwhich, at the start, it was overshadowed. The fact that the British\r\nEmpire comprises 28,615,000 square kilometers or exactly one-fifth of\r\nthe total land area of the earth, and that the Russian Empire contains\r\nover one-seventh, are full of encouragement for Anglo-Saxon and Slav,\r\nbut contain a warning to the other peoples of the world.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nature of expansion in new and old countries.]\r\n\r\nThe large area which misleads a primitive folk into excessive dispersion\r\nand the dissipation of their tribal powers, offers to an advanced\r\npeople, who in some circumscribed habitat have learned the value of\r\nland, the freest conditions for their development. A wide, unobstructed\r\nterritory, occupied by a sparse population of wandering tribes capable\r\nof little resistance to conquest or encroachment, affords the most\r\nfavorable conditions to an intruding superior race. Such conditions the\r\nChinese found in Mongolia and Manchuria, the Russians in Siberia, and\r\nEuropean colonists in the Americas, Australia and Africa. Almost\r\nunlimited space and undeveloped resources met their land hunger and\r\ntheir commercial ambition. Their numerical growth was rapid, both by the\r\nnatural increase reflecting an abundant food supply, and by accessions\r\nfrom the home countries. Expansion advanced by strides. In contrast to\r\nthis care-free, easy development in a new land, growth in old countries\r\nlike Europe and the more civilized parts of Asia means a slow protrusion\r\nof the frontier, made at the cost of blood; it means either the\r\nabsorption of the native people, because there are no unoccupied corners\r\ninto which they can be driven, or the imposition upon them of an\r\nunwelcome rule exercised by alien officials. Witness the advance of the\r\nRussians into Poland and Finland, of the Germans into Poland and\r\nAlsace-Lorraine, of the Japanese into Korea, and of the English into\r\ncrowded India.\r\n\r\nThe rapid unfolding of the geographical horizon in a young land\r\ncommunicates to an expanding people new springs of mobility, new motives\r\nfor movement out and beyond the old confines, new goals holding out new\r\nand undreamt of benefits. Life becomes fresh, young, hopeful. Old checks\r\nto natural increase of population are removed. Emigrant bands beat out\r\nnew trails radiating from the old home. They go on individual initiative\r\nor state-directed enterprises; but no matter which, the manifold life\r\nin the far-away periphery reacts upon the center to vivify and\r\nrejuvenate it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Relation of ethnic to political expansion.]\r\n\r\nThe laws of the territorial growth of peoples and of states are in\r\ngeneral the same. The main differences between the two lies in the fact\r\nthat ethnic expansion, since it depends upon natural increase, is slow,\r\nsteady, and among civilized peoples is subject to slight fluctuations;\r\nwhile the frontiers of a state, after a long period of permanence, can\r\nsuddenly be advanced by conquest far beyond the ethnic boundaries,\r\noften, however, only to be as quickly lost again. Therefore the\r\nimportant law may be laid down, that the more closely the territorial\r\ngrowth of a state keeps pace with that of its people, and the more\r\nnearly the political area coincides with the ethnic, the greater is the\r\nstrength and stability of the state. This is the explanation of the\r\nvigor and permanence of the early English colonies in America. The slow\r\nwestward protrusion of their frontier of continuous settlement within\r\nthe boundaries of the Allegheny Mountains formed a marked contrast to\r\nthe wide sweep of French voyageur camp and lonely trading-station in the\r\nCanadian forests, and even more to the handful of priests and soldiers\r\nwho for three centuries kept an unsteady hold upon the Spanish empire in\r\nthe Western Hemisphere. The political advance of the United States\r\nacross the continent from the Alleghenies to the Mississippi, thence to\r\nthe Rocky Mountains, and thence to the Pacific was always preceded by\r\nbands of enterprising settlers, who planted themselves beyond the\r\nfrontier and beckoned to the flag to follow. The great empires of\r\nantiquity were enlarged mechanically by conquest and annexation. They\r\nwere mosaics, not growths. The cohesive power of a common ethnic bond\r\nwas lacking; so was the modern substitute for this to be found in close\r\neconomic interdependence maintained by improved methods of\r\ncommunication. Hence these empires soon broke up again along lines of\r\nold geographic and ethnic cleavage. For Rome, the cementing power of the\r\nMediterranean and the fairly unified civilization which this enclosed\r\nsea had been evolving since the dawn of Cretan and Phoenician trade,\r\ncompensated in part for the lack of common speech and national ideals\r\nthroughout the political domain. But the Empire proved in the end to be\r\nmerely a mosaic, easily broken.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Relation of people and state to political boundary.]\r\n\r\nThe second point of difference between the expansion of peoples and of\r\nstates lies in their respective relation to the political frontier. This\r\nconfines the state like a stockade, fixing the territorial limits of its\r\nadministrative functions; but for the subjects of the state it is an\r\nimaginary line, powerless to check the range of their activities, except\r\nwhen a military or tariff war is going on. The state boundary, if it\r\ncoincides with a strong natural barrier, may for decades or even\r\ncenturies succeed in confining a growing people, if these, by\r\nintelligent economy, increase the productivity of the soil whose area\r\nthey are unable to extend. Yet the time comes even for these when they\r\nmust break through the barriers and secure more land, either by foreign\r\nconquest or colonization. The classic example of the confinement of a\r\npeople within its political boundaries is the long isolation of Japan\r\nfrom 1624 to 1854. The pent-up forces there accumulated, in a population\r\nwhich had doubled itself in the interval and which by hard schooling was\r\nmade receptive to every improved economic method, manifest themselves in\r\nthe insistent demand for more land which has permeated all the recent\r\npolicy of Japan. But the history of Japan is exceptional. The rule is\r\nthat the growing people slowly but continually overflow their political\r\nboundary, which then advances to cover the successive flood plains of\r\nthe national inundation, or yet farther to anticipate the next rise.\r\nThis has been the history of Germany in its progress eastward across the\r\nElbe, the Oder, the Vistula and the Niemen. The dream of a greater\r\nempire embraces all the German-speaking people from Switzerland, Tyrol\r\nand Steiermark to those outlying groups in the Baltic provinces of\r\nRussia and the related offshoot in Holland.[314] [See map page 223.]\r\n\r\nThough political boundaries, especially where they coincide with natural\r\nbarriers, may restrict the territorial growth of a people, on the other\r\nhand, political expansion is always a stimulus to racial expansion,\r\nbecause it opens up more land and makes the conditions of life easier\r\nfor an increasing people, by relieving congestion in the older areas.\r\nMore than this, it materially aids while guiding and focusing the\r\nout-going streams of population. Thus it keeps them concentrated for the\r\nreinforcement of the nation in the form of colonies, and tends to reduce\r\nthe political evil of indiscriminate emigration, by which the streams\r\nare dissipated and diverted to strengthen other nations. Witness the\r\nactive internal colonization practiced by Germany in her Polish\r\nterritory,[315] by Russia in Siberia, in an effort to make the ethnic\r\nboundary hurry after and overtake the political frontier.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Expansion of civilization.]\r\n\r\nJust as the development of a people and state is marked by advance from\r\nsmall to ever larger areas, so is that of a civilization. It may\r\noriginate in a small district; but more mobile than humanity itself, it\r\ndoes not remain confined to one spot, but passes on from individual to\r\nindividual and from people to people. Greece served only as a garden in\r\nwhich the flowers of Oriental and Egyptian civilization were temporarily\r\ntransplanted. As soon as they were modified and adapted to their new\r\nconditions, their seed spread over all Europe. The narrow area of\r\nancient Greece, which caused the early dissemination of its people over\r\nthe Mediterranean basin, and thereby weakened the political force of the\r\ncountry at home, was an important factor in the wide distribution of its\r\nculture. Commerce, colonization and war are vehicles of civilization,\r\nwhere favorable geographic conditions open the way for trade in the wake\r\nof the victorious army. The imposition of Roman dominion meant\r\neverywhere the gift of Roman civilization. The Crusaders brought back\r\nfrom Syria more than their scars and their trophies. Every European\r\nfactory in China, every Hudson Bay Company post in the wilds of northern\r\nCanada, every Arab settlement in savage Africa is surrounded by a sphere\r\nof trade; and this in turn is enclosed in a wider sphere of influence\r\nthrough which its civilization, though much diluted, has filtered. The\r\nhigher the civilization, the wider the area which it masters. The\r\nmanifold activities of a civilized people demand a large sphere of\r\ninfluence, and include, furthermore, improved means of communication\r\nwhich enable it to control such a sphere.\r\n\r\nEven a relatively low civilization may spread over a vast area if\r\ncarried by a highly mobile people. Mohammedanism, which embodies a\r\ncultural system as well as a religion, found its vehicles of dispersal\r\nin the pastoral nomads occupying the arid land of northern Africa and\r\nwestern Asia, and thus spread from the Senegal River to Chinese\r\nTurkestan. It was carried by the maritime Arabs of Oman and Yemen to\r\nMalacca and Sumatra, where it was communicated to the seafaring Malays.\r\nThese island folk, who approximate the most highly civilized peoples in\r\ntheir nautical efficiency, distributed the meager elements of Mohammedan\r\ncivilization over the Malay Archipelago. [See map of the Religions of\r\nthe Eastern Hemisphere, in chapter XIV.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cultural advantages of large political area.]\r\n\r\nThe larger the area which a civilized nation occupies, the more numerous\r\nare its points of contact with other peoples, and the less likely is\r\nthere to be a premature crystallization of its civilization from\r\nisolation. Extension of area on a large scale means eventually extension\r\nof the seaboard and access to those multiform international relations\r\nwhich the ocean highway confers. The world wide expansion of the British\r\nEmpire has given it at every outward step wider oceanic contact and\r\neventually a cosmopolitan civilization. The same thing is true of the\r\nother great colonial empires of history, whether Portuguese, Spanish,\r\nDutch or French; and even of the great continental empires, like Russia\r\nand the United States. The Russian advance across Siberia, like the\r\nAmerican advance across the Rockies, meant access to the Pacific, and a\r\nmodification of its civilization on those remote shores.\r\n\r\nA large area means varied vicinal locations and hence differentiation of\r\ncivilization, at least along the frontier. How rapidly the vivifying\r\ninfluences of this contact will penetrate into the bulk of the interior\r\ndepends upon size, location as scattered or compact, and general\r\ngeographic conditions like navigable rivers or mountains, which\r\nfacilitate or bar intercourse with that interior. The Russian Empire has\r\neleven different nations, speaking even more different languages, on its\r\nwestern and southern frontiers. Its long line of Asiatic contact will\r\ninevitably give to the European civilization transplanted hither in\r\nRussian colonies a new and perhaps not unfruitful development. The\r\nSiberian citizen of future centuries may compare favorably with his\r\nbrother in Moscow. Japan, even while impressing its civilization upon\r\nthe reluctant Koreans, will see itself modified by the contact and its\r\nculture differentiated by the transplanting; but the content of Japanese\r\ncivilization will be increased by every new variant thus formed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Politico-economic advantages.]\r\n\r\nThe larger the area brought under one political control, the less the\r\nhandicap of internal friction and the greater its economic independence.\r\nVast territory has enabled the United States to maintain with advantage\r\na protective tariff, chiefly because the free trade within its own\r\nborders was extensive. The natural law of the territorial growth of\r\nstates and peoples means an extension of the areas in which peace and\r\ncoöperation are preserved, a relative reduction of frontiers and of the\r\nmilitary forces necessary to defend them,[316] diminution in the sum\r\ntotal of conflicts, and a wider removal of the border battle fields. In\r\nplace of the continual warfare between petty tribes which prevailed in\r\nNorth America four hundred years ago, we have to-day the peaceful\r\ncompetition of the three great nations which have divided the continent\r\namong them. The political unification of the Mediterranean basin under\r\nthe Roman Empire restricted wars to the remote land frontiers. The\r\nforeign wars of Russia, China, and the United States in the past century\r\nhave been almost wholly confined to the outskirts of their big domains,\r\nmerely scratching the rim and leaving the great interior sound and\r\nundisturbed. Russia's immense area is the military ally on which she can\r\nmost surely count. The long road to Moscow converted Napoleon's victory\r\ninto a defeat; and the resistless advance of the Japanese from Port\r\nArthur to the Sungari River led only to a peace robbed of the chief\r\nfruits of victory. The numerous wars of the British Empire have been\r\nlimited to this or that corner, and have scarcely affected the\r\nprosperity of the great remainder, so that their costs have been readily\r\nborne and their wounds rapidly healed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Political area and the national horizon.]\r\n\r\nThe territorial expansion of peoples and states is attended by an\r\nevolution of their spacial conceptions and ideals. Primitive peoples,\r\naccustomed to dismemberment in small tribal groups, bear all the marks\r\nof territorial contraction. Their geographical horizon is usually fixed\r\nby the radius of a few days' march. Inter-tribal trade and intercourse\r\nreach only rudimentary development, under the prevailing conditions of\r\nmutual antagonism and isolation, and hence contribute little to the\r\nexpansion of the horizon. Knowing only their little world, such\r\nprimitive groups overestimate the size and importance of their own\r\nterritory, and are incapable of controlling an extensive area. This is\r\nthe testimony of all travellers who have observed native African states.\r\nThough the race or stock distribution may be wide, like that of the\r\nAthapascan and Algonquin Indians, and their war paths long, like the\r\ncampaigns of the Iroquois against the Cherokees of the Tennessee River,\r\nyet the unit of tribal territory permanently occupied is never large.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: National estimates of area.]\r\n\r\nSmall naturally defined regions, which take the lead in historical\r\ndevelopment because they counteract the primitive tendency towards\r\nexcessive dispersal, are in danger of teaching too well their lesson of\r\nconcentration. In course of time geographic enclosure begins to betray\r\nits limitations. The extent of a people's territory influences their\r\nestimate of area _per se_, determines how far land shall be made the\r\nbasis of their national purposes, fixes the territorial scale of their\r\nconquests and their political expansion. This is a conspicuous\r\npsychological effect of a narrow local environment. A people embedded\r\nfor centuries in a small district measure area with a short yardstick.\r\nThe ancient Greeks devised a philosophic basis for the advantages of the\r\nsmall state, which is extolled in the writings of Plato and\r\nAristotle.[317] Aristotle wanted it small enough, \"to be comprehended at\r\none glance of the statesman's eye.\" Plato's ideal democracy, by rigid\r\nlaws limiting the procreative period of women and men and providing for\r\nthe death of children born out of this period or out of wedlock,\r\nrestricted its free citizens to 5,040 heads of families,[318] all living\r\nwithin reach of the agora, and all able to judge from personal knowledge\r\nof a candidate's fitness for office. This condition was possible only\r\nin dwarf commonwealths like the city-states of the Hellenic world. The\r\nfailure of the Greeks to build up a political structure on a territorial\r\nscale commensurate with their cultural achievements and with the wide\r\nsphere of their cultural influence can be ascribed chiefly to their\r\ninability to discard the contracted territorial ideas engendered by\r\ngeographic and political dismemberment. The little Judean plateau, which\r\ngave birth to a universal religion, clung with provincial bigotry to the\r\nnarrow tribal creed and repudiated the larger faith of Christ, which\r\nfound its appropriate field in Mediterranean Europe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Estimates of area in small maritime states.]\r\n\r\nMaritime peoples of small geographic base have a characteristic method\r\nof expansion which reflects their low valuation of area. Their limited\r\namount of arable soil necessitates reliance upon foreign sources of\r\nsupply, which are secured by commerce. Hence they found trading stations\r\nor towns among alien peoples on distant coasts, selecting points like\r\ncapes or inshore islets which can be easily defended and which at the\r\nsame time command inland or maritime routes of trade. The prime\r\ngeographic consideration is location, natural and vicinal. The area of\r\nthe trading settlement is kept as small as possible to answer its\r\nimmediate purpose, because it can be more easily defended.[319] Such were\r\nthe colonies of the ancient Phoenicians and Greeks in the Mediterranean,\r\nof the Medieval Arabs and the Portuguese on the east coast of Africa and\r\nin India. This method reached its ultimate expression in point of small\r\narea, seclusion, and local autonomy, perhaps, in the Hanse factories in\r\nNorway and Russia.[320] But all these widespread nuclei of expansion\r\nremained barren of permanent national result, because they were designed\r\nfor a commercial end, and ignored the larger national mission and surer\r\neconomic base found in acquisition of territory. Hence they were\r\nshort-lived, succumbing to attack or abandoned on the failure of local\r\nresources, which were ruthlessly exploited.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Limitations of small territorial conceptions.]\r\n\r\nThat precocious development characteristic of small naturally defined\r\nareas shows its inherent weakness in the tendency to accept the enclosed\r\narea as a nature-made standard of national territory. The earlier a\r\nstate fixes its frontier without allowance for growth, the earlier comes\r\nthe cessation of its development. Therefore the geographical nurseries\r\nof civilization were infected with germs of decay. Such was the history\r\nof Egypt, of Yemen, of Greece, Crete, and Phoenicia. These are the\r\nregions which, as Carl Ritter says, have given the whole fruit of their\r\nexistence to the world for its future use, have conferred upon the world\r\nthe trust which they once held, afterward to recede, as it were, from\r\nview.[321] They were great in the past, and now they belong to those\r\nimmortal dead whose greatness has been incorporated in the world's\r\nlife--\"the choir invisible\" of the nations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Evolution of territorial policies.]\r\n\r\nThe advance from a small, self-dependent community to interdependent\r\nrelations with other peoples, then to ethnic expansion or union of\r\ngroups to form a state or empire is a great turning point in any\r\nhistory. Thereby the clan or tribe discards the old paralyzing seclusion\r\nof the primitive society and the narrow habitat, and joins that march of\r\nethnic, political and cultural progress which has covered larger and\r\nlarger areas, and by increase of common purpose has cemented together\r\never greater aggregates.\r\n\r\nNothing is more significant in the history of the English in America\r\nthan the rapid evolution of their spacial ideals, their abandonment of\r\nthe small territorial conception brought with them from the mother\r\ncountry and embodied, for example, in that munificent land grant, fifty\r\nby a hundred miles in extent, of the first Virginia charter in 1606, and\r\ntheir progress to schemes of continental expansion. Every accession of\r\nterritory to the Thirteen Colonies and to the Republic gave an impulse\r\nto growth. Expansion kept pace with opportunity. Only in small and\r\nisolated New England did the contracted provincial point of view\r\npersist. It manifested itself in a narrow policy of concentration and\r\ncurtailment, which acquiesced in the occlusion of the Mississippi River\r\nto the Trans-Allegheny settlements by Spain in 1787, and which later\r\nopposed the purchase of the Louisiana territory[322] and the acquisition\r\nof the Philippines.\r\n\r\nAll peoples who have achieved wide expansion have developed in the\r\nprocess vast territorial policies. This is true of the pastoral nomads\r\nwho in different epochs have inundated Europe, northern Africa and the\r\nperipheral lands of Asia, and of the great colonial nations who in a few\r\ndecades have brought continents under their dominion. In nomadic hordes\r\nit is based upon habitual mobility and the possession of herds, which\r\nare at once incentive and means for extending the geographical horizon;\r\nbut it suffers from the evanescent character of nomadic political\r\norganization, and the tendency toward dismemberment bred in all pastoral\r\nlife by dispersal over scattered grazing grounds. Hence the empires set\r\nup by nomad conquerors like the Saracens and Tartars soon fall apart.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Colonial expansion.]\r\n\r\nAmong highly civilized agricultural and industrial peoples, on the other\r\nhand, a vast territorial policy is at once cause and effect of national\r\ngrowth; it is at once an innate tendency and a conscious purpose\r\ntenaciously followed. It makes use of trade and diplomacy, of scientific\r\ninvention and technical improvement, to achieve its aims. It becomes an\r\naccepted mark of political vigor and an ideal even among peoples who\r\nhave failed to enlarge their narrow base. The model of Russian expansion\r\non the Pacific was quickly followed by awakened Japan, stirred out of\r\nher insular complacence by the threat of Muscovite encroachment. Germany\r\nand Italy, each strengthened and enlarged as to national outlook by\r\nrecent political unification, have elbowed their way into the crowded\r\ncolonial field. The French, though not expansionists as individuals,\r\nhave an excellent capacity for collective action when directed by\r\ngovernment. The officials whom Louis XIV sent to Canada in the\r\nseventeenth century executed large schemes of empire reflecting the\r\ndilation of French frontiers in Europe. These ideals of expansion seem\r\nto have been communicated by the power of example, or the threat of\r\ndanger in them, to the English colonists in Virginia and Pennsylvania,\r\nand later to Washington and Jefferson.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The mind of colonials.]\r\n\r\nThe best type of colonial expansion is found among the English-speaking\r\npeople of America, Australia and South Africa. Their spacial ideas are\r\nbuilt on a big scale. Distances do not daunt them. The man who could\r\nconceive a Cape-to-Cairo railroad, with all the schemes of territorial\r\naggrandizement therein implied, had a mind that took continents for its\r\nunits of measure; and he found a fitting monument in a province of\r\nimperial proportions whereon was inscribed his name. Bryce tells us that\r\nin South Africa the social circle of \"the best people\" includes\r\nPretoria, Johannesburg, Kimberley, Bloemfontein and Cape Town--a social\r\ncircle with a diameter of a thousand miles![323]\r\n\r\nThe spirit of our western frontier, so long as there was a frontier, was\r\nthe spirit of movement, of the conquest of space. It found its\r\nexpression in the history of the Wilderness Road and the Oregon Trail.\r\nWhen the center of population in the United States still lingered on the\r\nshore of Chesapeake Bay, and the frontier of continuous settlement had\r\nnot advanced beyond the present western boundary of Virginia and\r\nPennsylvania, the spacious mind of Thomas Jefferson foresaw the\r\nMississippi Valley as the inevitable and necessary possession of the\r\nAmerican people, and looked upon the trade of the far-off Columbia River\r\nas a natural feeder of the Mississippi commerce.[324]\r\n\r\nEmerson's statement that the vast size of the United States is reflected\r\nin the big views of its people applies not only to political policy,\r\nwhich in the Monroe Doctrine for the first time in history has embraced\r\na hemisphere; nor is it confined to the big scale of their economic\r\nprocesses. Emerson had in mind rather their whole conception of national\r\nmission and national life, especially their legislation,[325] for which\r\nhe anticipated larger and more Catholic aims than obtain in Europe,\r\nhampered as it is by countless political and linguistic boundaries and\r\nbarred thereby from any far-reaching unity of purpose and action.\r\n\r\nCanada, British South Africa, Australia and the United States, though\r\nwidely separated, have in common a certain wide outlook upon life, a\r\ncontinental element in the national mind, bred in their people by their\r\ngenerous territories. The American recognizes his kinship of mind with\r\nthese colonial Englishmen as something over and above mere kinship of\r\nrace. It consists in their deep-seated common democracy, the democracy\r\nborn in men who till fields and clear forests, not as plowmen and\r\nwood-cutters, but as makers of nations. It consists in identical\r\ninterests and points of view in regard to identical problems growing out\r\nof the occupation and development of new and almost boundless\r\nterritories. Race questions, paucity of labor, highways and railroads,\r\nimmigration, combinations of capital, excessive land holdings, and\r\nillegal appropriation of land on a large scale, are problems that meet\r\nthem all. The monopolistic policy of the United States in regard to\r\nAmerican soil as embodied in the Monroe Doctrine, and the expectation\r\nlurking in the mental background of every American that his country may\r\neventually embrace the northern continent, find their echo in\r\nAustralia's plans for wider empire in the Pacific. The Commonwealth of\r\nAustralia has succeeded in getting into its own hands the administration\r\nof British New Guinea (90,500 square miles.) It has also secured from\r\nthe imperial government the unusual privilege of settling the relations\r\nbetween itself and the islands of the Pacific, because it regards the\r\nPacific question as the one question of foreign policy in which its\r\ninterests are profoundly involved. In the same way the British in South\r\nAfrica, sparsely scattered though they are, feel an imperative need of\r\nfurther expansion, if their far-reaching schemes of commerce and empire\r\nare to be realized.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Colonials as road builders.]\r\n\r\nThe effort to annihilate space by improved means of communication has\r\nabsorbed the best intellects and energies of expanding peoples. The\r\nancient Roman, like the Incas of Peru, built highways over every part of\r\nthe empire, undaunted by natural obstacles like the Alps and Andes.\r\nModern expansionists are railroad builders. Witness the long list of\r\nstrategic lines, constructed or subsidized by various governments during\r\nthe past half century--the Union Pacific, Central Pacific, Canadian\r\nPacific, Trans-Siberian, Cairo-Khartoum, Cape Town-Zambesi, and now the\r\nproposed Trans-Saharan road, designed to unite the Mediterranean and\r\nGuinea colonies of French Africa. The equipment of the American roads,\r\nwith their heavy rails, giant locomotives, and enormous freight cars,\r\nreveals adaptation to a commerce that covers long distances between\r\nstrongly differentiated areas of production, and that reflects the vast\r\nenterprises of this continental country. The same story comes out in the\r\nocean vessels which serve the trade of the Great Lakes, and in the acres\r\nof coal barges in a single fleet which are towed down the Ohio and\r\nMississippi by one mammoth steel tug.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Practical bent of colonials.]\r\n\r\nThe abundant natural resources awaiting development in such big new\r\ncountries give to the mind of the people an essentially practical bent.\r\nThe rewards of labor are so great that the stimulus to effort is\r\nirresistible. Economic questions take precedence of all others, divide\r\npolitical parties, and consume a large portion of national legislation;\r\nwhile purely political questions sink into the background. Civilization\r\ntakes on a material stamp, becomes that \"dollar civilization\" which is\r\nthe scorn of the placid, paralyzed Oriental or the old world European.\r\nThe genius of colonials is essentially practical. Impatience of\r\nobstacles, short cuts aiming at quick returns, wastefulness of land, of\r\nforests, of fuel, of everything but labor, have long characterized\r\nAmerican activities. The problem of an inadequate labor supply attended\r\nthe sudden accession of territory opened for European occupation by the\r\ndiscovery of America, and caused a sudden recrudescence of slavery,\r\nwhich as an industrial system had long been outgrown by Europe. It has\r\nalso given immense stimulus to invention, and to the formation of labor\r\nunions, which in the newest colonial fields, like Australia and New\r\nZealand, have dominated the government and given a Utopian stamp to\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nYet underlying and permeating this materialism is a youthful idealism.\r\nTransplanted to conditions of greater opportunity, the race becomes\r\nrejuvenated, abandons outgrown customs and outworn standards,\r\nexperiences an enlargement of vision and of hope, gathers courage and\r\nenergy equal to its task, manages somehow to hitch its wagon to a star.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n[292] Chamberlain and Salisbury, Geology, Vol. III, pp. 483-485.

Everywhere she keeps her borders melting,\r\nwavering, advancing, retreating. If by some cataclysm sharp lines of\r\ndemarcation are drawn, she straightway begins to blur them by creating\r\nintermediate forms, and thus establishes the boundary zone which\r\ncharacterizes the inanimate and animate world. A stratum of limestone or\r\nsandstone, when brought into contact with a glowing mass of igneous\r\nrock, undergoes various changes due to the penetrating heat of the\r\nvolcanic outflow, so that its surface is metamorphosed as far as that\r\nheat reaches. The granite cliff slowly deposits at its base a rock-waste\r\nslope to soften the sudden transition from its perpendicular surface to\r\nthe level plain at its feet. The line where a land-born river meets the\r\nsea tends to become a sandbar or a delta, created by the river-borne\r\nsilt and the wash of the waves, a form intermediate between land and\r\nsea, bearing the stamp of each, fluid in its outlines, ever growing by\r\nthe persistent accumulation of mud, though ever subject to inundation\r\nand destruction by the waters which made it. The alluvial coastal hems\r\nthat edge all shallow seas are such border zones, reflecting in their\r\nflat, low surfaces the dead level of the ocean, in their composition the\r\nsolid substance of the land; but in the miniature waves imprinted on the\r\nsands and the billows of heaped-up boulders, the master workman of the\r\ndeep leaves his mark. [See map page 243.]\r\n\r\nUnder examination, even our familiar term coastline proves to be only an\r\nabstraction with no corresponding reality in nature. Everywhere, whether\r\non margin of lake or gulf, the actual phenomenon is a coast zone,\r\nalternately covered and abandoned by the waters, varying in width from a\r\nfew inches to a few miles, according to the slope of the land, the range\r\nof the tide and the direction of the wind. It has one breadth at the\r\nminimum or neap tide, but increases often two or three fold at spring\r\ntide, when the distance between ebb and flood is at its maximum. At the\r\nmouth of Cook's Inlet on the southern Alaskan coast, where the range of\r\ntides is only eight feet, the zone is comparatively narrow, but widens\r\nrapidly towards the head of the inlet, where the tide rises twenty-three\r\nfeet above the ebb line, and even to sixty-five feet under the influence\r\nof a heavy southwest storm. On flat coasts we are familiar with the wide\r\nfrontier of salt marshes, that witness the border warfare of land and\r\nsea, alternate invasion and retreat. In low-shored estuaries like those\r\nof northern Brittany and northwestern Alaska, this amphibian girdle of\r\nthe land expands to a width of four miles, while on precipitous coasts\r\nof tideless sea basins it contracts to a few inches. Hence this boundary\r\nzone changes with every impulse of the mobile sea and with every varying\r\nconfiguration of the shore. Movement and external conditions are the\r\nfactors in its creation. They make something that is only partially akin\r\nto the two contiguous forms. Here on their outer margins land and ocean\r\ncompromise their physical differences, and this by a law which runs\r\nthrough animate and inanimate nature. Wherever one body moves in\r\nconstant contact with another, it is subjected to modifying influences\r\nwhich differentiate its periphery from its interior, lend it a\r\ntransitional character, make of it a penumbra between light and shadow.\r\nThe modifying process goes on persistently with varying force, and\r\ncreates a shifting, changing border zone which, from its nature, cannot\r\nbe delimited. For convenience' sake, we adopt the abstraction of a\r\nboundary line; but the reality behind this abstraction is the important\r\nthing in anthropo-geography.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gradations in the boundary zone.]\r\n\r\nAll so-called boundary lines with which geography has to do have this\r\nsame character,--coastlines, river margins, ice or snow lines, limits of\r\nvegetation, boundaries of races or religions or civilizations, frontiers\r\nof states. They are all the same, stamped by the eternal flux of nature.\r\nBeyond the solid ice-pack which surrounds the North Pole is a wide\r\ngirdle of almost unbroken drift ice, and beyond this is an irregular\r\nconcentric zone of scattered icebergs which varies in breadth with\r\nseason, wind and local current; a persistent decrease in continuity from\r\nsolid pack to open sea. The line of perpetual snow on high mountains\r\nadvances or retreats from season to season, from year to year; it drops\r\nlow on chilly northern slopes and recedes to higher altitudes on a\r\nsouthern exposure; sends down long icy tongues in dark gorges, and\r\nleaves outlying patches of old snow in shaded spots or beneath a\r\ncovering of rock waste far below the margin of the snow fields.\r\n\r\nIn the struggle for existence in the vegetable world, the tree line\r\npushes as far up the mountain as conditions of climate and soil will\r\npermit. Then comes a season of fiercer storms, intenser cold and\r\ninvading ice upon the peaks. Havoc is wrought, and the forest drops back\r\nacross a zone of border warfare--for war belongs to borders--leaving\r\nbehind it here and there a dwarfed pine or gnarled and twisted juniper\r\nwhich has survived the onslaught of the enemy, Now these are stragglers\r\nin the retreat, but are destined later in milder years to serve as\r\noutposts in the advance of the forest to recover its lost ground. Here\r\nwe have a border scene which is typical in nature--the belt of unbroken\r\nforest, growing thinner and more stunted toward its upper edge,\r\nsucceeded by a zone of scattered trees, which may form a cluster perhaps\r\nin some sheltered gulch where soil has collected and north winds are\r\nexcluded, and higher still the whitened skeleton of a tree to show how\r\nfar the forest once invaded the domain of the waste.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Oscillating boundaries]\r\n\r\nThe habitable area of the earth everywhere shows its boundaries to be\r\nperipheral zones of varying width, now occupied and now deserted,\r\nprotruding or receding according to external conditions of climate and\r\nsoil, and subject to seasonal change. The distribution of human life\r\nbecomes sparser from the temperate regions toward the Arctic Circle,\r\nforeshadowing the unpeopled wastes of the ice-fields beyond. The outward\r\nmovement from the Tropics poleward halts where life conditions\r\ndisappear, and there finds its boundary; but as life conditions advance\r\nor retreat with the seasons, so does that boundary. On the west coast of\r\nGreenland the Eskimo village of Etah, at about the seventy-eighth\r\nparallel, marks the northern limit of permanent or winter settlement;\r\nbut in summer the Eskimo, in his kayak, follows the musk-ox and seal\r\nmuch farther north and there leaves his igloo to testify to the wide\r\nrange of his poleward migration. Numerous relics of the Eskimo and their\r\nsummer encampments have been found along Lady Franklin Bay in northern\r\nGrinnell Land (81° 50' N. L.), but in the interior, on the outlet\r\nstreams of Lake Hazen, explorers have discovered remains of habitations\r\nwhich had evidently, in previous ages, been permanently occupied.[326] The\r\nMurman Coast of the Kola Peninsula has in summer a large population of\r\nRussian fishermen and forty or more fishing stations; but when the catch\r\nis over at the end of August, and the Arctic winter approaches, the\r\nstations are closed, and the three thousand fishermen return to their\r\npermanent homes on the shores of the White Sea.[327] Farther east along\r\nthis polar fringe of Russia, the little village of Charbarova, located\r\non the Jugor Strait, is inhabited in summer by a number of Samoyedes,\r\nwho pasture their reindeer over on Vaygats Island, and by some Russians\r\nand Finns, who come from the White Sea towns to trade with the Samoyedes\r\nand incidentally to hunt and fish. But in the fall, when a new ice\r\nbridge across the Strait releases the reindeer from their enclosed\r\npasture on the island, the Samoyedes withdraw southward, and the\r\nmerchants with their wares to Archangel and other points. This has gone\r\non for centuries.[328] On the Briochov Islands at the head of the Yenisei\r\nestuary Nordenskiold found a small group of houses which formed a summer\r\nfishing post in 1875, but which was deserted by the end of August.[329]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Altitude boundary zones.]\r\n\r\nAn altitude of about five thousand feet marks the limit of village life\r\nin the Alps; but during the three warm months of the year, the summer\r\npastures at eight thousand feet or more are alive with herds and their\r\nkeepers. The boundary line of human life moves up the mountains in the\r\nwake of spring and later hurries down again before the advance of\r\nwinter. The Himalayan and Karakorum ranges show whole villages of\r\ntemporary occupation, like the summer trading town of Gartok at 15,000\r\nfeet on the caravan route from Leh to Lhassa, or Shahidula (3,285 meters\r\nor 10,925 feet) on the road between Leh and Yarkand;[330] but the boundary\r\nof permanent habitation lies several thousand feet below. Comparable to\r\nthese are the big hotels that serve summer stage-coach travel over the\r\nAlps and Rockies, but which are deserted when the first snow closes the\r\npasses. Here a zone of altitude, as in the polar regions a zone of\r\nlatitude, marks the limits of the habitable area.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Wallace's Line\" a typical boundary zone.]\r\n\r\nThe distribution of animals and races shows the limit of their movements\r\nor expansion. Any boundary defining the limits of such movements can not\r\nfrom its nature be fixed, and hence can not be a line. It is always a\r\nzone. Yet \"Wallace's Line,\" dividing the Oriental from the Australian\r\nzoological realm, and running through Macassar Strait southward between\r\nBali and Lombok, is a generally accepted dictum. The details of\r\nWallace's investigation, however, reveal the fact that this boundary is\r\nnot a line, but a zone of considerable and variable width, enclosing the\r\nline on either side with a marginal belt of mixed character. Though\r\nCelebes, lying to the east of Macassar Strait, is included in the\r\nAustralian realm, it has lost so large a proportion of Australian types\r\nof animals, and contains so many Oriental types from the west, that\r\nWallace finds it almost impossible to decide on which side of the line\r\nit belongs.[331] The Oriental admixture extends yet farther east over the\r\nMoluccas and Timor. Birds of Javan or Oriental origin, to the extent of\r\nthirty genera, have spread eastward well across Wallace's Line; some of\r\nthese stop short at Flores, and some reach even to Timor,[332] while\r\nAustralian cockatoos, in turn, have been seen on the west coast of Bali\r\nbut not in Java, Heilprin avoids the unscientific term line, because he\r\nfinds his zoological realms divided by \"transition regions,\" which are\r\nintermediate in animal types as they are in geographical location.[333]\r\nWallace notes a similar \"debatable land\" in the Rajputana Desert east of\r\nthe Indus, which is the border district between the Oriental and\r\nEthiopian realms.[334]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Boundaries as limits of movements or expansion.]\r\n\r\nSuch boundaries mark the limits of that movement which is common to all\r\nanimate things. Every living form spreads until it meets natural\r\nconditions in which it can no longer survive, or until it is checked by\r\nthe opposing expansion of some competing form. If there is a change\r\neither in the life conditions or in the strength of the competing forms,\r\nthe boundary shifts. In the propitious climate of the Genial Period,\r\nplants and animals lived nearer to the North Pole than at present; then\r\nthey fell back before the advance of the ice sheet. The restless\r\nsurface of the ocean denies to man a dwelling place; every century,\r\nhowever, the Dutch are pushing forward their northern boundary by\r\nreclamation of land from the sea; but repeatedly they have had to drop\r\nback for a time when the water has again overwhelmed their hand-made\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Peoples as barriers.]\r\n\r\nThe boundaries of race and state which are subjected to greatest\r\nfluctuations are those determined by the resistance of other peoples.\r\nThe westward sweep of the Slavs prior to eighth century carried them\r\nbeyond the Elbe into contact with the Germans; but as these increased in\r\nnumbers, outgrew their narrow territories and inaugurated a\r\ncounter-movement eastward, the Slavs began falling back to the Oder, to\r\nthe Vistula, and finally to the Niemen. Though the Mohawk Valley opened\r\nan easy avenue of expansion westward for the early colonists of New\r\nYork, the advance of settlements up this valley for several decades went\r\non at only a snail's pace, because of the compact body of Iroquois\r\ntribes holding this territory. In the unoccupied land farther south\r\nbetween the Cumberland and Ohio rivers the frontier went forward with\r\nleaps and bounds, pushed on by the expanding power of the young\r\nRepublic. [See map page 156.]\r\n\r\nAnything which increases the expanding force of a people--the\r\nestablishment of a more satisfactory government by which the national\r\nconsciousness is developed, as in the American and French revolutions,\r\nthe prosecution of a successful war by which popular energies are\r\nreleased from an old restraint, mere increase of population, or an\r\nimpulse communicated by some hostile and irresistible force behind--all\r\nare registered in an advance of the boundary of the people in question\r\nand a corresponding retrusion of their neighbor's frontier.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Boundary zone as index of growth or decline.]\r\n\r\nThe border district is the periphery of the growing or declining race or\r\nstate. It runs the more irregularly, the greater are the variations in\r\nthe external conditions as represented by climate, soil, barriers, and\r\nnatural openings, according as these facilitate or obstruct advance.\r\nWhen it is contiguous with the border of another state or race, the two\r\nform a zone in which ascendency from one side or the other is being\r\nestablished. The boundary fluctuates, for equilibrium of the contending\r\nforces is established rarely and for only short periods. The more\r\naggressive people throws out across this debatable zone, along the lines\r\nof least resistance or greatest attraction, long streamers of\r\noccupation; so that the frontier takes on the form of a fringe of\r\nsettlement, whose interstices are occupied by a corresponding fringe of\r\nthe displaced people. Such was its aspect in early colonial America,\r\nwhere population spread up every fertile river valley across a zone of\r\nIndian land; and such it is in northern Russia to-day, where long narrow\r\nSlav bands run out from the area of continuous Slav settlement across a\r\nwide belt of Mongoloid territory to the shores of the White Sea and\r\nArctic Ocean.[335] [See maps pages 103 and 225.]\r\n\r\nThe border zone is further broadened by the formation of ethnic islands\r\nbeyond the base line of continuous settlement, which then advances more\r\nor less rapidly, if expansion is unchecked, till it coalesces with these\r\noutposts, just as the forest line on the mountains may reach, under\r\nadvantageous conditions, its farthest outlying tree. Such ethnic\r\npeninsulas and islands we see in the early western frontiers of the\r\nUnited States from 1790 to 1840, when that frontier was daily moving\r\nwestward.[336] [See map page 156.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Breadth of the boundary zone.]\r\n\r\nThe breadth of the frontier zone is indicative of the activity of growth\r\non the one side and the corresponding decline on the other, because\r\nextensive encroachment in the same degree disintegrates the territory of\r\nthe neighbor at whose cost such encroachment is made. A straight, narrow\r\nrace boundary, especially if it is nearly coincident with a political\r\nboundary, points to an equilibrium of forces which means, for the time\r\nbeing at least, a cessation of growth. Such boundaries are found in old,\r\nthickly populated countries, while the wide, ragged border zone belongs\r\nto new, and especially to colonial peoples. In the oldest and most\r\ndensely populated seats of the Germans, where they are found in the\r\nRhine Valley, the boundaries of race and empire are straight and simple;\r\nbut the younger, eastern border, which for centuries has been steadily\r\nadvancing at the cost of the unequally matched Slavs, has the ragged\r\noutline and sparse population of a true colonial frontier. Between two\r\npeoples who have had a long period of growth behind them, the\r\noscillations of the boundary decrease in amplitude, as it were, and\r\nfinally approach a state of rest. Each people tends to fill out its area\r\nevenly; every advance in civilization, every increase of population,\r\nincreases the stability of their tenure, and hence the equilibrium of\r\nthe pressure upon the boundary. Therefore, in such countries, racial,\r\nlinguistic and cultural boundaries tend to become simpler and\r\nstraighter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The broad frontier zone of active expansion.]\r\n\r\nThe growth is more apparent, or, in other words, the border zone is\r\nwidest and most irregular, where a superior people intrudes upon the\r\nterritory of an interior race. Such was the broad zone of thinly\r\nscattered farms and villages amid a prevailing wilderness and hostile\r\nIndian tribes which, in 1810 and 1820, surrounded our Trans-Allegheny\r\narea of continuous settlement in a one to two hundred mile wide girdle.\r\nSuch has been the wide, mobile frontier of the Russian advance in\r\nSiberia and until recently in Manchuria, which aimed to include within a\r\ndotted line of widely separated railway-guard stations, Cossack\r\nbarracks, and penal colonies, the vast territory which later generations\r\nwere fully to occupy. Similar, too, is the frontier of the Dutch and\r\nEnglish settlements in South Africa, which has been pushed forward into\r\nthe Kaffir country--a broad belt of scattered cattle ranches and\r\nisolated mining hives, dropped down amid Kaffir hunting and grazing\r\nlands. Broader still was that shadowy belt of American occupation which\r\nfor four decades immediately succeeding the purchase of Louisiana\r\nstretched in the form of isolated fur-stations, lonely trappers' camps,\r\nand shifting traders' _rendezvous_ from the Mississippi to the western\r\nslope of the Rockies and the northern watershed of the Missouri, where\r\nit met the corresponding nebulous outskirts of the far-away Canadian\r\nstate on the St. Lawrence River.\r\n\r\nThe same process with the same geographical character has been going on\r\nin the Sahara, as the French since 1890 have been expanding southward\r\nfrom the foot of the Atlas Mountains in Algeria toward Timbuctoo at the\r\ncost of the nomad Tuaregs. Territory is first subdued and administered\r\nby the military till it is fully pacified. Then it is handed over to the\r\ncivil government. Hence the advancing frontier consists of a military\r\nzone of administration, with a civil zone behind it, and a weaker\r\nwavering zone of exploration and scout work before it.[337] Lord Curzon\r\nin his Romanes lecture describes the northwest frontier of India as just\r\nsuch a three-ply border.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Economic factors in expanding frontiers.]\r\n\r\nThe untouched resources of such new countries tempt to the widespread\r\nsuperficial exploitation, which finds its geographical expression in a\r\nbroad, dilating frontier. Here the man-dust which is to form the future\r\npolitical planet is thinly disseminated, swept outward by a centrifugal\r\nforce. Furthermore, the absence of natural barriers which might block\r\nthis movement, the presence of open plains and river highways to\r\nfacilitate it, and the predominance of harsh conditions of climate or\r\nsoil rendering necessary a savage, extensive exploitation of the slender\r\nresources, often combine still further to widen the frontier zone. This\r\nwas the case in French Canada and till recent decades in Siberia, where\r\nintense cold and abundant river highways stimulated the fur trade to the\r\npractical exclusion of all other activities, and substituted for the\r\nclosely grouped, sedentary farmers with their growing families the\r\nwide-ranging trader with his Indian or Tunguse wife and his half-breed\r\noffspring. Under harsh climatic conditions, the fur trade alone afforded\r\nthose large profits which every infant colony must command in order to\r\nsurvive; and the fur trade meant a wide frontier zone of scattered posts\r\namid a prevailing wilderness. The French in particular, by the\r\npossession of the St. Lawrence and Mississippi rivers, the greatest\r\nsystems in America, were lured into the danger of excessive expansion,\r\nattenuated their ethnic element, and failed to raise the economic status\r\nof their wide border district, which could therefore offer only slight\r\nresistance to the spread of solid English settlement.[338] Yet more\r\nrecently, the chief weakness of the Russians in Siberia and\r\nManchuria--apart from the corruption of the national government--was the\r\nweakness of a too remote and too sparsely populated frontier, and of a\r\npeople whose inner development had not kept pace with their rate of\r\nexpansion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Value of barrier boundaries.]\r\n\r\nWasteful exploitation of a big territory is easier than the economical\r\ndevelopment of a small district. This is one line of least resistance\r\nwhich civilized man as well as savage instinctively follows, and which\r\nexplains the tendency toward excessive expansion characteristic of all\r\nprimitive and nascent peoples. For such peoples natural barriers which\r\nset bounds to this expansion are of vastly greater importance than they\r\nare for mature or fully developed peoples. The reason is this: the\r\nboundary is only the expression of the outward movement or growth, which\r\nis nourished from the same stock of race energy as is the inner\r\ndevelopment. Either carried to an excess weakens or retards the other.\r\nIf population begins to press upon the limits of subsistence, the\r\nacquisition of a new bit of territory obviates the necessity of applying\r\nmore work and more intelligence to the old area, to make it yield\r\nsubsistence for the growing number of mouths; the stimulus to adopt\r\nbetter economic methods is lost. Therefore, natural boundaries drawn by\r\nmountain, sea and desert, serving as barriers to the easy appropriation\r\nof new territory, have for such peoples a far deeper significance than\r\nthe mere determination of their political frontiers by physical\r\nfeatures, or the benefit of protection.\r\n\r\nThe land with the most effective geographical boundaries is a naturally\r\ndefined region like Korea, Japan, China, Egypt, Italy, Spain, France or\r\nGreat Britain--a land characterized not only by exclusion from without\r\nthrough its encircling barriers, but also by the inclusion within itself\r\nof a certain compact group of geographic conditions, to whose combined\r\ninfluences the inhabitants are subjected and from which they cannot\r\nreadily escape. This aspect is far more important than the mere\r\nprotection which such boundaries afford. They are not absolutely\r\nnecessary for the development of a people, but they give it an early\r\nstart, accelerate the process, and bring the people to an early\r\nmaturity; they stimulate the exploitation of all the local geographic\r\nadvantages and resources, the formation of a vivid tribal or national\r\nconsciousness and purpose, and concentrate the national energies when\r\nthe people is ready to overleap the old barriers. The early development\r\nof island and peninsula peoples and their attainment of a finished\r\nethnic and political character are commonplaces of history. The stories\r\nof Egypt, Crete and Greece, of Great Britain and Japan, illustrate the\r\nstimulus to maturity which emanates from such confining boundaries. The\r\nwall of the Appalachians narrowed the westward horizon of the early\r\nEnglish colonies in America, guarded them against the excessive\r\nexpansion which was undermining the French dominion in the interior of\r\nthe continent, set a most wholesome limit to their aims, and thereby\r\nintensified their utilization of the narrow land between mountains and\r\nsea. France, with its limits of growth indicated by the Mediterranean,\r\nPyrenees, Atlantic, Channel, Vosges, Jura and Western Alps, found its\r\nperiod of adolescence shortened and, like Great Britain, early reached\r\nits maturity. Nature itself set the goal of its territorial expansion,\r\nand by crystallizing the political ideal of the people, made that goal\r\neasier to reach, just as the dream of \"United Italy\" realized in 1870\r\nhad been prefigured in contours drawn by Alpine range and Mediterranean\r\nshore-line.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The sea as the absolute boundary]\r\n\r\nThe area which a race or people occupies is the resultant of the\r\nexpansive force within and the obstacles without, either physical or\r\nhuman. Insurmountable physical obstacles are met where all life\r\nconditions disappear, as on the borders of the habitable world, where\r\nman is barred from the unpeopled wastes of polar ice-fields and\r\nunsustaining oceans. The frozen rim of arctic lands, the coastline of\r\nthe continents, the outermost arable strip on the confines of the\r\ndesert, the barren or ice-capped ridge of high mountain range, are all\r\nsuch natural boundaries which set more or less effective limits to the\r\nmovement of peoples and the territorial growth of states. The sea is the\r\nonly absolute boundary, because it alone blocks the continuous, unbroken\r\nexpansion of a people. When the Saxons of the lower Elbe spread to the\r\nisland of Britain, a zone of unpeopled sea separated their new\r\nsettlements from their native villages on the mainland. Even the most\r\npronounced land barriers, like the Himalayas and Hindu Kush, have their\r\npassways and favored spots for short summer habitation, where the people\r\nfrom the opposite slopes meet and mingle for a season. Sandy wastes are\r\nhospitable at times. When the spring rains on the mountains of Abyssinia\r\nstart a wave of moisture lapping over the edges of the Nubian desert,\r\nit is immediately followed by a tide of Arabs with their camels and\r\nherds, who make a wide zone of temporary occupation spread over the\r\nnewly created grassland, but who retire in a few weeks before the\r\ndesiccating heat of summer.[339]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Natural boundaries as bases of ethnic and political\r\nboundaries.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, all natural features of the earth's surface which serve to\r\ncheck, retard or weaken the expansion of peoples, and therefore hold\r\nthem apart, tend to become racial or political boundaries; and all\r\npresent a zone-like character. The wide ice-field of the Scandinavian\r\nAlps was an unpeopled waste long before the political boundary was drawn\r\nalong it. \"It has not in reality been a definite natural _line_ that has\r\ndivided Norway from her neighbour on the east; it has been a _band_ of\r\ndesert land, up to hundreds of miles in width. So utterly desolate and\r\napart from the area of continuous habitation has this been, that the\r\ngreater part of it, the district north of Trondhjem, was looked upon\r\neven as recently as the last century as a common district. Only nomadic\r\nLapps wandered about in it, sometimes taxed by all three countries. A\r\nparcelling out of this desert common district was not made toward Russia\r\nuntil 1826. Toward Sweden it was made in 1751.\"[340] In former centuries\r\nthe Bourtanger Moor west of the River Ems used to be a natural desert\r\nborderland separating East and West Friesland, despite the similarity of\r\nrace, speech and country on either side of it. It undoubtedly\r\ncontributed to the division of Germany and the Netherlands along the\r\npresent frontier line, which has been drawn the length of this moor for\r\na hundred kilometers.[341]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Primitive waste boundaries.]\r\n\r\nAny geographical feature which, like this, presents a practically\r\nuninhabitable area, forms a scientific boundary, not only because it\r\nholds apart the two neighboring peoples and thereby reduces the contact\r\nand friction which might be provocative of hostilities, but also because\r\nit lends protection against attack. This motive, as also the zone\r\ncharacter of all boundaries, comes out conspicuously in the artificial\r\nborder wastes surrounding primitive tribes and states in the lower\r\nstatus of civilization. The early German tribes depopulated their\r\nborders in a wide girdle, and in this wilderness permitted no neighbors\r\nto reside. The width of this zone indicated the valor and glory of the\r\nstate, but was also valued as a means of protection against unexpected\r\nattack.[342] Cæsar learned that between the Suevi and Cherusci tribes\r\ndwelling near the Rhine \"_silvam esse ibi, infinita magnitudine quae\r\nappelletur Bacenis; hanc longe introrsus pertinere et pro nativo muro\r\nobjectam Cheruscos ab Suevis Suevosque ab Cheruscis injuriis\r\nincursionibusque prohibere_.\"[343] The same device appears among the\r\nHuns. When Attila was pressing upon the frontier of the Eastern Empire\r\nin 448 A.D., his envoys sent to Constantinople demanded that the Romans\r\nshould not cultivate a belt of territory, a hundred miles wide and three\r\nhundred miles long, south of the Danube, but maintain this as a\r\nMarch.[344] When King Alfonso I. (751-764 A.D.) of mountain Asturias\r\nbegan the reconquest of Spain from the Saracens, he adopted the same\r\nmethod of holding the foe at arm's length. He seized Old Castile as far\r\nas the River Duoro, but the rest of the province south of that stream he\r\nconverted into a waste boundary by transporting the Christians thence to\r\nthe north side, and driving the Mohammedans yet farther southward.[345]\r\nSimilarly Xenophon found that the Armenian side of the River Kentrites,\r\nwhich formed the boundary between the Armenian plains and the highlands\r\nof Karduchia, was unpeopled and destitute of villages for a breadth of\r\nfifteen miles, from fear of the marauding Kurds.[346] In the eastern\r\nSudan, especially in that wide territory along the Nile-Congo watershed\r\noccupied by the Zandeh, Junker found the frontier wilderness a regular\r\ninstitution owing to the exposure of the border districts in the\r\nperennial intertribal feuds.[347] The same testimony comes from\r\nBarth,[348] Boyd Alexander,[349] Speke,[350] and other explorers in the\r\nSudan and the neighboring parts of equatorial Africa.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Border wastes of Indian lands.]\r\n\r\nThe vast and fertile region defined by the Ohio and Tennessee rivers,\r\nlay as a debatable border between the Algonquin Indians of the north\r\nand the Appalachians of the south. Both claimed it, both used it for\r\nhunting, but neither dared dwell therein.[351] Similarly the Cherokees\r\nhad no definite understanding with their savage neighbors as to the\r\nlimits of their respective territories The effectiveness of their claim\r\nto any particular tract of country usually diminished with every\r\nincrease of its distance from their villages. The consequence was that a\r\nconsiderable strip of territory between the settlements of two tribes,\r\nCherokees and Creeks for instance, though claimed by both, was\r\npractically considered neutral ground and the common hunting ground of\r\nboth.[352] The Creeks, whose most western villages from 1771 to 1798 were\r\nlocated along the Coosa and upper Alabama rivers,[353] were separated by\r\n300 miles of wilderness from the Chickasaws to the northwest, and by a\r\n150-mile zone from the Choctaws. The most northern Choctaw towns, in\r\nturn, lay 160 miles to the south of the Chickasaw nation, whose compact\r\nsettlements were located on the watershed between the western sources of\r\nthe Tombigby and the head stream of the Yazoo.[354] The wide intervening\r\nzone of forest and canebrake was hunted upon by both nations.[355]\r\n\r\nSometimes the border is preserved as a wilderness by formal agreement. A\r\nclassic example of this case is found in the belt of untenanted land,\r\nfifty to ninety kilometers wide, which China and Korea once maintained\r\nas their boundary. No settler from either side was allowed to enter, and\r\nall travel across the border had to use a single passway, where three\r\ntimes annually a market was held.[356] On the Russo-Mongolian border\r\nsouth of Lake Baikal, the town of Kiakhta, which was established in 1688\r\nas an entrepôt of trade between the two countries, is occupied in its\r\nnorthern half by Russian factories and in its southern by the\r\nMongolian-Chinese quarters, while between the two is a neutral space\r\ndevoted to commerce.[357]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Alien intrusions into border wastes.]\r\n\r\nThese border wastes do not always remain empty, however, even when their\r\nintegrity is respected by the two neighbors whom they serve to divide;\r\nalien races often intrude into their unoccupied reaches. The boundary\r\nwilderness between the Sudanese states of Wadai and Dar Fur harbors\r\nseveral semi-independent states whose insignificance is a guarantee of\r\ntheir safety from conquest.[358] Similarly in the wide border district\r\nbetween the Creeks on the east and the Choctaws on the west were found\r\ntypical small, detached tribes--the Chatots and Thomez of forty huts\r\neach on the Mobile River, the Tensas tribe with a hundred huts on the\r\nTensas River, and the Mobilians near the confluence of the Tombigby and\r\nAlabama.[359] Along the desolate highland separating Norway and Sweden\r\nthe nomadic Lapps, with their reindeer herds, have penetrated southward\r\nto 62° North Latitude, reinforcing the natural barrier by another\r\nbarrier of alien race. From this point southward, the coniferous forests\r\nbegin and continue the border waste in the form of a zone some sixty\r\nmiles wide; this was unoccupied till about 1600, when into it slowly\r\nfiltered an immigration of Finns, whose descendants to-day constitute an\r\nimportant part of the still thin population along the frontier to the\r\nheights back of Christiania. Only thirty miles from the coast does the\r\nborder zone between Norway and Sweden, peopled chiefly by intruding\r\nforeign stocks, Lapps and Finns, contract and finally merge into the\r\ndenser Scandinavian settlements.[360]\r\n\r\nWhere the border waste offers favorable conditions of life and the\r\nintruding race has reached a higher status of civilization, it\r\nmultiplies in this unpeopled tract and soon spreads at the cost of its\r\nless advanced neighbors. The old No Man's Land between the Ohio and\r\nTennessee was a line of least resistance for the expanding Colonies, who\r\nhere poured in a tide of settlement between the northern and southern\r\nIndians, just as later other pioneers filtered into the vague border\r\nterritory of weak tenure between the Choctaws and Creeks, and there on\r\nthe Tombigby, Mobile and Tensas rivers, formed the nucleus of the State\r\nof Alabama.[361]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Politico-economic significance of the waste boundary.]\r\n\r\nThis untenanted hem of territory surrounding so many savage and\r\nbarbarous peoples reflects their superficial and unsystematic\r\nutilization of their soil, by reason of which the importance of the land\r\nitself and the proportion of population to area are greatly reduced. It\r\nis a part of that uneconomic and extravagant use of the land, that\r\nappropriation of wide territories by small tribal groups, which\r\ncharacterizes the lower stages of civilization, as opposed to the\r\nexploitation of every square foot for the support of a teeming humanity,\r\nwhich marks the most advanced states. Each stage puts its own valuation\r\nupon the land according to the return from it which each expects to\r\nget. The low valuation is expressed in the border wilderness, by which a\r\nthird or even a half of the whole area is wasted; and also in the\r\nreadiness with which savages often sell their best territory for a song.\r\n\r\nFor the same reason they leave their boundaries undefined; a mile nearer\r\nor farther, what does it matter? Moreover, their fitful or nomadic\r\noccupation of the land leads to oscillations of the frontiers with every\r\nattack from without and every variation of the tribal strength within.\r\nTheir unstable states rarely last long enough in a given form or size to\r\ndevelop fixed boundaries; hence, the vagueness as to the extent of\r\ntribal domains among all savage peoples, and the conflicting land claims\r\nwhich are the abiding source of war. Owing to these overlapping\r\nboundaries--border districts claimed but not occupied--the American\r\ncolonists met with difficulties in their purchase of land from the\r\nIndians, often paying twice for the same strip.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Common boundary districts.]\r\n\r\nEven civilized peoples may adopt a waste boundary where the motive for\r\nprotection is peculiarly strong, as in the half-mile neutral zone of\r\nlowland which ties the rock of Gibraltar to Spain. On a sparsely\r\npopulated frontier, where the abundance of land reduces its value, they\r\nmay throw the boundary into the form of a common district, as in the\r\nvast, disputed Oregon country, accepted provisionally as a district of\r\njoint occupancy between the United States and Canada from 1818 to 1846,\r\nor that wide highland border which Norway so long shared with Russia and\r\nSweden. In South America, where land is abundant and population sparse,\r\nthis common boundary belt is not rare. It suggests a device giving that\r\nleeway for expansion desired by all growing states. By the treaty of\r\n1866, the frontier between Chile and Bolivia crossed the Atacama desert\r\nat 24° South Latitude; but the zone between 23° and 25° was left under\r\nthe common jurisdiction of the two states, for exploitation of the guano\r\ndeposits and mineral wealth.[362] A common border district on a much\r\nlarger scale is found between Brazil and the eastern frontier of French\r\nGuiana. It includes a belt 185 miles (300 kilometers) wide between the\r\nOyapok and Arawary rivers, and is left as a neutral district till its\r\nfate is decided by arbitration.[363] All these instances are only\r\ntemporary phases in the evolution of a political frontier from wide,\r\nneutral border to the mathematically determined boundary line required\r\nby modern civilized states.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tariff free zones.]\r\n\r\nEven when the boundary line has been surveyed and the boundary pillars\r\nset up, the frontier is prone to assert its old zonal nature, simply\r\nbecause it marks the limits of human movements. Rarely, for instance,\r\ndoes a customs boundary coincide with a political frontier, even in the\r\nmost advanced states of Europe, except on the coasts. The student of\r\nBaedecker finds a gap of several miles on the same railroad between the\r\ncustoms frontier of Germany and France, or France and Italy. Where the\r\nborder district is formed by a high and rugged mountain range, the\r\ncustom houses recede farther and farther from the common political line\r\nupon the ridge, and drop down the slope to convenient points, leaving\r\nbetween them a wide neutral tariff zone, like that in Haute Savoie along\r\nthe massive Mont Blanc Range between France and Italy.\r\n\r\nAllied to this phase, yet differing from it, is the \"Zona Libre\" or Free\r\nZone, 12 miles broad and 1,833 miles long, which forms the northern hem\r\nof Mexico from the Gulf to the Pacific. Here foreign goods pay only\r\n18-1/2 per cent., formerly only 2-1/2 per cent., of the usual federal\r\nduties. Goods going on into the interior pay the rest of the tariff at\r\nthe inner margin of the Zone. This arrangement was adopted in 1858 to\r\nestablish some sort of commercial equilibrium between the Mexican towns\r\nof the Rio Grande Valley, which were burdened by excessive taxation on\r\ninternal trade, and the Texas towns across the river, which at this time\r\nenjoyed a specially low tariff. Consequently prices of food and\r\nmanufactured goods were twice or four times as high on the Mexican as on\r\nthe American side. The result was persistent smuggling, extensive\r\nemigration from the southern to the northern bank, and the commercial\r\ndecline of the frontier states of Mexico, till the Zona Libre adjusted\r\nthe commercial discrepancy.[364] Since 1816 a tariff free zone a league\r\nwide has formed the border of French Savoy along the Canton and Lake of\r\nGeneva, thus uniting this canton by a free passway with the Swiss\r\nterritory at the upper end of the lake.[365]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Boundary zones of mingled race elements.]\r\n\r\nWhen the political boundary has evolved by a system of contraction out\r\nof the wide waste zone to the nicely determined line, that line,\r\nnevertheless, is always encased, as it were, in a zone of contact\r\nwherein are mingled the elements of either side. The zone includes the\r\nperipheries of the two contiguous racial or national bodies, and in it\r\neach is modified and assimilated to the other. On its edges it is\r\nstrongly marked by the characteristics of the adjacent sides, but its\r\nmedial band shows a mingling of the two in ever-varying proportions; it\r\nchanges from day to day and shifts backward and forward, according as\r\none side or the other exercises in it more potent economic, religious,\r\nracial, or political influences.\r\n\r\nIts peripheral character comes out strongly in the mingling of\r\ncontiguous ethnic elements found in every frontier district. Here is\r\nthat zone of transitional form which we have seen prevails so widely in\r\nnature. The northern borderland of the United States is in no small\r\ndegree Canadian, and the southern is strongly Mexican. In the Rio Grande\r\ncounties of Texas, Mexicans constituted in 1890 from 27 to 55 per cent.\r\nof the total population, and they were distributed in considerable\r\nnumbers also in the second tier of counties. A broad band of French and\r\nEnglish Canadians overlaps the northern hem of United States territory\r\nfrom Maine to North Dakota.[366] In the New York and New England counties\r\nbordering on the old French province of Quebec, they constitute from 11\r\nto 22 per cent. of the total population, except in two or three western\r\ncounties of Maine which have evidently been mere passways for a tide of\r\n_habitants_ moving on to more attractive conditions of life in the\r\ncounties just to the south.[367] But even these large figures do not\r\nadequately represent the British-American element within our boundaries,\r\nbecause they leave out of account the native-born of Canadian parents\r\nwho have been crossing our borders for over a generation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ethnic border zones in the Alps.]\r\n\r\nIf we turn to northern Italy, where a mountain barrier might have been\r\nexpected to segregate the long-headed Mediterranean stock from the\r\nbroad-headed Alpine stock, we find as a matter of fact that the ethnic\r\ntype throughout the Po basin is markedly brachycephalic and becomes more\r\npronounced along the northern boundary in the Alps, till it culminates\r\nin Piedmont along the frontier of France, where it becomes identical\r\nwith the broad-headed Savoyards.[368] More than this, Provençal French is\r\nspoken in the Dora Baltea Valley of Piedmont; and along the upper Dora\r\nRiparia and in the neighboring valleys of the Chisone and Pellice are\r\nthe villages of the refugee Waldenses, who speak an idiom allied to the\r\nProvençal. More than this, the whole Piedmontese Italian is\r\ncharacterized by its approach to the French, and the idiom of Turin\r\nsounds very much like Provençal.[369] To the north there is a similar\r\nexchange between Italy and Switzerland with the adjacent Austrian\r\nprovince of the Tyrol. In the rugged highlands of the Swiss Grisons\r\nbordering upon Italy, we find a pure Alpine stock, known to the ancients\r\nas the Rhaetians, speaking a degenerate Latin tongue called Romansch,\r\nwhich still persists also under the names of Ladino and Frioulian in the\r\nAlpine regions of the Tyrol and Italy. In fact, the map of linguistic\r\nboundaries in the Grisons shows the dovetailing of German, Italian, and\r\nRomansch in a broad zone.[370] The traveller in the southern Tyrol\r\nbecomes accustomed in the natives to the combination of Italian\r\ncoloring, German speech, and Alpine head form; whereas, if on reaching\r\nItaly he visits the hills back of Vicenza, he finds the German\r\nsettlements of Tredici and Sette Communi, where German customs,\r\nfolklore, language, and German types of faces still persist, survivals\r\nfrom the days of German infiltration across the Brenner Pass.[371]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SLAV-GERMAN BOUNDARY IN EUROPE.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Slav-German boundary.]\r\n\r\nWhere Slavs and Teutons come together in Central Europe, their race\r\nborder is a zone lying approximately between 14 and 24 degrees East\r\nLongitude; it is crossed by alternate peninsulas of predominant Germans\r\nand Austrians from the one side, Czechs and Poles from the other, the\r\nwhole spattered over by a sprinkling of the two elements. Rarely, and\r\nthen only for short stretches, do political and ethnic boundaries\r\ncoincide. The northern frontier hem of East Prussia lying between the\r\nRiver Niemen and the political line of demarcation is quite as much\r\nLithuanian as German, while German stock dots the whole surface of the\r\nBaltic provinces of Russia as far as St. Petersburg, The eastern rim of\r\nthe Kaiser's empire as far south as the Carpathians presents a broad\r\nband of the Polish race, averaging about fifty kilometers (30 miles) in\r\nwidth, sparsely sprinkled with German settlements; these are found\r\nfarther east also as an ethnic archipelago dotting the wide Slav area of\r\nPoland. The enclosed basin of Bohemia, protected on three sides by\r\nmountain walls and readily accessible to the Slav stock at the sources\r\nof the Vistula, enabled the Czechs to penetrate far westward and there\r\nmaintain themselves; but in spite of encompassing mountains, the inner\r\nor Bohemian slopes of the Boehmer Wald, Erz, and Sudetes ranges\r\nconstitute a broad girdle of almost solid German population.[372] In the\r\nAustrian provinces of Moravia and Silesia, which form the southeastward\r\ncontinuation of this Slav-German boundary zone, 60 per cent. of the\r\npopulation are Czechs, 33 per cent. are German, and 7 per cent., found\r\nin the eastern part of Silesia, are Poles.[373]\r\n\r\nAn ethnic map of the western Muscovite Empire in Europe shows a marked\r\ninfiltration into White and Little Russia of West Slavs from Poland,\r\nand in the province of Bessarabia alternate areas of Russians and\r\nRoumanians. The latter in places form an unbroken ethnic expansion\r\nfrom the home kingdom west of the Pruth, extending in solid bands as\r\nfar as the Dniester, and throwing out ethnic islands between this\r\nstream and the Bug.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ETHNOGRAPHICAL MAP OF RUSSIA.\r\nMONGOLOID: Kalmucks, Kirghis, Nogai, Tartars, Bashkirs, Voguls,\r\nOstiaks, Samoyedes.\r\nZIRIAN: Mingled Mongoloid and Finnish.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Assimilation of culture in boundary zones.]\r\n\r\nIn the northern provinces of Russia, in the broad zone shared by the\r\naboriginal Finns and the later-coming Slavs, Wallace found villages in\r\nevery stage of Russification. \"In one everything seemed thoroughly\r\nFinnish; the inhabitants had a reddish-olive skin, very high cheek\r\nbones, obliquely set eyes, and a peculiar costume; none of the women and\r\nvery few of the men could understand Russian and any Russian who visited\r\nthe place was regarded as a foreigner. In the second, there were already\r\nsome Russian inhabitants; the others had lost something of their purely\r\nFinnish type, many of the men had discarded the old costume and spoke\r\nRussian fluently, and a Russian visitor was no longer shunned. In a\r\nthird, the Finnish type was still further weakened; all the men spoke\r\nRussian, and nearly all the women understood it; the old male costume\r\nhad entirely disappeared and the old female was rapidly following it;\r\nand intermarriage with the Russian population was no longer rare. In a\r\nfourth, intermarriage had almost completely done its work, and the old\r\nFinnish element could be detected merely in certain peculiarities of\r\nphysiognomy and accent.\" This amalgamation extends to their\r\nreligions--prayers wholly pagan devoutly uttered under the shadow of a\r\nstrange cross, next the Finnish god Yumak sharing honors equally with\r\nthe Virgin, finally a Christianity pure in doctrine and outward forms\r\nexcept for the survival of old pagan ceremonies in connection with the\r\ndead.[374]\r\n\r\nAt the confluence of the Volga and Kama rivers, this boundary zone of\r\nRussians and Finns meets the borderland of the Asiatic Mongols; and here\r\nis found an intermingling of races, languages, religions, and customs\r\nscarcely to be equalled elsewhere. Finns are infused with Tartar as well\r\nas Russian blood, and Russians show Tartar as well as Finnish traits.\r\nThe Bashkirs, who constitute an ethnic peninsula running from the solid\r\nMongolian mass of Asia, show every type of the mongrel.[375] [See map\r\npage 225.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Boundary zones of assimilation in Asia.]\r\n\r\nIf we turn to Asia and examine the western race boundary of the\r\nexpanding Chinese, we find that a wide belt of mingled ethnic elements,\r\nhybrid languages, and antagonistic civilizations marks the transition\r\nfrom Chinese to Mongolian and Tibetan areas. The eastern and southern\r\nfrontiers of Mongolia, formerly marked by the Great Wall, are now\r\ndifficult to define, owing to the steady encroachment of the\r\nagricultural Chinese on the fertile edges of the plateau, where they\r\nhave converted the best-watered pastures of the Mongols into millet\r\nfields and vegetable gardens, leaving for the nomad's herds the more\r\nsterile patches between.[376] Every line of least resistance--climatic,\r\nindustrial, commercial--sees the Chinese widening this transitional\r\nzone. He sprinkles his crops over the \"Land of Grass,\" invades the trade\r\nof the caravan towns, sets up his fishing station on the great northern\r\nbend of the Hoangho in the Ordos country, three hundred miles beyond the\r\nWall, to exploit the fishing neglected by the Mongols.[377] The\r\nwell-watered regions of the Nan-Shan ranges has enabled him to drive a\r\nlong, narrow ethnic wedge, represented by the westward projection of\r\nKansu Province between Mongolia and Tibet, into the heart of the Central\r\nPlateau. [See map page 103.] Here the nomad Si Fan tribes dwell side by\r\nside with Chinese farmers,[378] who themselves show a strong infusion of\r\nthe Mongolian and Tibetan blood to the north and south, and whose\r\nlanguage is a medley of all three tongues.[379]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Boundary zones of mountain Tibet.]\r\n\r\nIn easternmost Tibet, in the elevated province of Minjak (2,600 meters\r\nor 8,500 feet), M. Hue found in 1846 a great number of Chinese from the\r\nneighboring Sze-Chuan and Yun-nan districts keeping shops and following\r\nthe primary trades and agriculture. The language of the Tibetan natives\r\nshowed the effect of foreign intercourse; it was not the pure speech of\r\nLhassa, but was closely assimilated to the idiom of the neighboring Si\r\nFan speech of Sze-Chuan and contained many Chinese expressions. He found\r\nalso a modification of manners, customs, and costumes in this peripheral\r\nTibet; the natives showed more of the polish, cunning, and covetousness\r\nof the Chinese, less of the rudeness, frankness, and strong religious\r\nfeeling characteristic of the western plateau man.[380] Just across the\r\npolitical boundary in Chinese territory, the border zone of assimilation\r\nshows predominance of the Chinese element with a strong Tibetan\r\nadmixture both in race and civilization.[381] Here Tibetan traders with\r\ntheir yak caravans are met on the roads or encamped in their tents by\r\nthe hundred about the frontier towns, whither they have brought the\r\nwool, sheep, horses, hides and medicinal roots of the rough highland\r\nacross that \"wild borderland which is neither Chinese nor Tibetan.\" The\r\nChinese population consists of hardy mountaineers, who eat millet and\r\nmaize instead of rice. The prevailing architecture is Tibetan and the\r\npriests on the highways are the red and yellow lamas from the Buddhist\r\nmonasteries of the plateau. \"The Country is a cross between China and\r\nTibet.\"[382]\r\n\r\nEven the high wall of the Himalayas does not suffice to prevent similar\r\nexchanges of ethnic elements and culture between southern Tibet and\r\nnorthern India. Lhassa and Giamda harbor many emigrants from the\r\nneighboring Himalayan state of Bhutan, allow them to monopolize the\r\nmetal industry, in which they excel, and to practise undisturbed their\r\nIndian form of Buddhism.[383] The southern side of this zone of\r\ntransition is occupied by a Tibetan stock of people inhabiting the\r\nHimalayan frontiers of India and practising the Hindu religion.[384] In\r\nthe hill country of northern Bengal natives are to be seen with the\r\nChinese queue hanging below a Hindu turban, or wearing the Hindu caste\r\nmark on their broad Mongolian faces. With these are mingled genuine\r\nTibetans who have come across the border to work in the tea plantations\r\nof this region.[385] [See map page 102.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Relation of ethnic and cultural assimilation.]\r\n\r\nThe assimilation of culture within a boundary zone is in some respects\r\nthe result of race amalgamation, as, for instance, in costume, religion,\r\nmanners and language; but in economic points it is often the result of\r\nidentical geographic influences to which both races are alike subjected.\r\nFor example, scarcity of food on the arid plateau of Central Asia makes\r\nthe Chinese of western Kansu eat butter and curds as freely as do the\r\npastoral Mongols, though such a diet is obnoxious to the purely\r\nagricultural Chinese of the lowlands.[386] The English pioneer in the\r\nTrans-Allegheny wilderness shared with the Indians an environment of\r\ntrackless forests and savage neighbors; he was forced to discard for a\r\ntime many essentials of civilization, both material and moral. Despite a\r\nminimum of race intermixture, the men of the Cumberland and Kentucky\r\nsettlements became assimilated to the life of the red man; they borrowed\r\nhis scalping knife and tomahawk, adopted his method of ambush and\r\nextermination in war; like him they lived in great part by the chase,\r\ndressed in furs and buckskin, and wore the noiseless moccasin. Here the\r\nmere fact of geographical location on a remote frontier, and of almost\r\ncomplete isolation from the centers of English life on the Atlantic\r\nslope, and the further fact of persistent contact with a lower status of\r\ncivilization, resulted in a temporary return to primitive methods of\r\nexistence, till the settlements secured an increase of population\r\nadequate for higher industrial development and for defence.\r\n\r\nA race boundary involves almost inevitably a cultural boundary, often,\r\ntoo, a linguistic and religionary, occasionally a political boundary.\r\nThe last three are subject to wide fluctuation, frequently overstepping\r\nall barriers of race and contrasted civilizations. Though one often\r\naccompanies another, it is necessary to distinguish the different kinds\r\nof boundaries and to estimate their relative importance in the history\r\nof a people or state. We may lay down the rule that the greater, more\r\npermanent, and deep-seated the contrasts on the two sides of a border,\r\nthe greater is its significance; and that, on this basis, boundaries\r\nrank in importance, with few exceptions, in the following order: racial,\r\ncultural, linguistic, and political. The less marked the contrasts, in\r\ngeneral, the more rapid and complete the process of assimilation in the\r\nbelt of borderland.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The boundary zone in political expansion.]\r\n\r\nThe significance of the border zone of assimilation for political\r\nexpansion lies in the fact that it prepares the way for the advance of\r\nthe state boundary from either side; in it the sharp edge of racial and\r\ncultural antagonism is removed, or for this antagonism a new affinity\r\nmay be substituted. The zone of American settlement, industry, and\r\ncommerce which in 1836 projected beyond the political boundary of the\r\nSabine River over the eastern part of Mexican Texas facilitated the\r\nlater incorporation of the State into the Union, just as a few years\r\nearlier the Baton Rouge District of Spanish West Florida had gravitated\r\nto the United States by reason of the predominant American element\r\nthere, and thus extended the boundary of Louisiana to the Pearl River.\r\nWhen the political boundary of Siberia was fixed at the Amur River, the\r\nMuscovite government began extending the border zone of assimilation far\r\nto the south of that stream by the systematic Russification of\r\nManchuria, with a view to its ultimate annexation. Schleswig-Holstein\r\nand Alsace-Lorraine, by reason of their large German population, have\r\nbeen readily incorporated into the German Empire. Only in Lorraine has a\r\nconsiderable French element retarded the process. The considerable\r\nsprinkling of Germans over the Baltic provinces of Russia and Poland\r\nwest of the Vistula, and a certain Teutonic stamp of civilization which\r\nthese districts have received, would greatly facilitate the eastward\r\nextension of the German Empire; while their common religions, both\r\nProtestant and Roman Catholic, would help obliterate the old political\r\nfissure. Thus the borderland of a country, so markedly differentiated\r\nfrom its interior, performs a certain historical function, and becomes,\r\nas it were, an organ of the living, growing race or state.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tendency toward defection along political frontiers.]\r\n\r\nLocation on a frontier involves remoteness from the center of national,\r\ncultural, and political activities; these reach their greatest intensity\r\nin the core of the nation and exercise only an attenuated influence on\r\nthe far-away borders, unless excellent means of communication keep up a\r\ncirculation of men, commodities, and ideas between center and periphery.\r\nFor the frontier, therefore, the centripetal force is weakened; the\r\ncentrifugal is strengthened often by the attraction of some neighboring\r\nstate or tribe, which has established bonds of marriage, trade, and\r\nfriendly intercourse with the outlying community. Moreover, the mere\r\ninfusion of foreign blood, customs, and ideas, especially a foreign\r\nreligion, which is characteristic of a border zone, invades the national\r\nsolidarity. Hence we find that a tendency to political defection\r\nconstantly manifests itself along the periphery. A long reach weakens\r\nthe arm of authority, especially where serious geographical barriers\r\nintervene; hence border uprisings are usually successful, at least for a\r\ntime. When accomplished, they involve that shrinkage of the frontiers\r\nwhich we have found to be the unmistakable symptom of national decline.\r\n\r\nThis defection shows itself most promptly in conquered border tribes of\r\ndifferent blood, who lack the bond of ethnic affinity, and whose\r\nremoteness emboldens them to throw off the political yoke. The decay of\r\nthe Roman Empire, after its last display of energy under Trajan, was\r\nregistered in the revolt of its peripheral districts beyond the\r\nEuphrates, Danube, and Rhine, as also in the rapid Teutonization of\r\neastern Gaul, which here prepared the way for the assertion of\r\nindependence. The border satraps of the ancient Persian Empire were\r\nconstantly revolting, as the history of Asia Minor shows. Aragon, Old\r\nCastile, and Portugal were the first kingdoms in the Iberian Peninsula\r\nto throw off Saracen dominion. Mountain ranges and weary stretches of\r\ndesert roads enabled the rebellions in Chinese Turkestan and the border\r\ndistricts of Sungaria in 1863 to be maintained for several years.[387]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Centrifugal forces on the frontier.]\r\n\r\nA feeble grasp upon remote peripheral possessions is often further\r\nweakened by the resistance of an immigrant population from beyond the\r\nboundary, which brings with it new ideas of government. This was the\r\ngeographical history of the Texan revolt. A location on the far northern\r\noutskirts of Mexican territory, some twelve hundred miles from the\r\ncapital, rendered impossible intelligent government control, the\r\nenforcement of the laws, and prompt defence against the Indians.\r\nRemoteness weakened the political cohesion. More than this, the American\r\nethnic boundary lapped far over eastern Texas, forming that border zone\r\nof two-fold race which we have come to know. This alien stock,\r\nantagonistic to the national ideals emanating from the City of Mexico,\r\ndominant over the native population by reason of its intelligence,\r\nenergy, and wealth, ruptured the feeble political bond and asserted the\r\nindependence of Texas. Quite similar was the history of the \"Independent\r\nState of Acre,\" which in 1899 grew up just within the Bolivian frontier\r\nunder the leadership of Brazilian caoutchouc gatherers, resisted the\r\ncollection of taxes by the Bolivian government, and four years later\r\nsecured annexation to Brazil.[388]\r\n\r\nEven when no alien elements are present to weaken the race bond, if\r\nnatural barriers intervene to obstruct and retard communications between\r\ncenter and periphery, the frontier community is likely to develop the\r\nspirit of defection, especially if its local geographic, and hence\r\nsocial, conditions are markedly different from those of the governing\r\ncenter. This is the explanation of that demand for independent statehood\r\nwhich was rife in our Trans-Allegheny settlements from 1785 to 1795, and\r\nof that separatist movement which advocated political alliance with\r\neither the British colonies to the north or the Spanish to the west,\r\nbecause these were nearer and offered easier access to the sea. A\r\nfrontier location and an intervening mountain barrier were important\r\nfactors in the Whisky Rebellion in western Pennsylvania, just as similar\r\nconditions later suggested the secession of the Pacific States from the\r\nUnion. Disaffection from the government was manifested by the Trek Boers\r\nof early South Africa, \"especially by those who dwelt in the outlying\r\ndistricts where the Government had exerted and could exert little\r\ncontrol.\" In 1795 the people of Graaf-Reinet, a frontier settlement of\r\nthat time, revolted against the Dutch South African Company and set up a\r\nminiature republic.[389]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The spirit of colonial frontiers.]\r\n\r\nThe spirit of the colonial frontier is the spirit of freedom, the spirit\r\nof men who have traveled far, who are surcharged with energy, enterprise\r\nand self-reliance, often with impatience of restraint. A severe process\r\nof elimination culls out for the frontier a population strikingly\r\ndifferentiated from the citizens of the old inhabited centers. Then\r\nremoteness of location and abundance of opportunity proceed to emphasize\r\nthe qualities which have squeezed through the sieve of natural and\r\nsocial selection. This is the type bred upon our own frontier, which,\r\nWest beyond West, has crossed the continent from the backwoods of the\r\nAllegheny Mountains to the Pacific. The Siberian frontier develops much\r\nthe same type on the eastern edge of the Russian Empire. Here army\r\nofficers find a compensation for their rough surrounding in the escape\r\nfrom the excessive bureaucracy of the capitals. Here is to be noted the\r\nindependence, self-reliance and self-respect characteristic of other\r\ncolonial frontiers. The Russian of the Asiatic border is proud to call\r\nhimself a Siberian: he is already differentiated in his own\r\nconsciousness. The force of Moscow tradition and discipline is faint\r\nwhen it reaches him, it has traveled so far. Even the elaborate\r\nobservances of the orthodox Greek Church tend to become simplified on\r\nthe frontier. The question naturally arises whether in the Russian\r\nEmpire, as in the United States, the political periphery will in time,\r\nreact upon the center, infuse it with the spirit of progress and\r\nyouth.[390]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Free border states as political survivals.]\r\n\r\nWhen to a border situation is added a geographic location affording\r\nconditions of long-established isolation, this tendency to maintain\r\npolitical autonomy becomes very pronounced. This is the explanation of\r\nso many frontier mountain states that have retained complete or partial\r\nindependence, such as Nepal, Bhutan, the Asturias, which successfully\r\nwithstood Saracen attack, and Montenegro, which has repelled alike\r\nVenetian, Servian, and Turkish dominion. Europe especially has numerous\r\nexamples of these unabsorbed border states, whose independence\r\nrepresents the equilibrium of the conflicting political attractions\r\nabout them. But all these smallest fragments of political territory have\r\neither some commercial or semi-political union with one or another of\r\ntheir neighbors. The little independent principality of Liechtenstein,\r\nwedged in between Switzerland and the Tyrol, is included in the customs\r\nunion of Austro-Hungary. The small, independent duchy of Luxemburg,\r\nwhich has been attached in turn to all the great states which have grown\r\nup along its borders, is included in the _Zollverein_ of Germany. The\r\nrepublic of Andorra, far up in a lofty valley of the Pyrenees, which has\r\nmaintained its freedom for a thousand years, acknowledges certain rights\r\nof suzerainty exercised by France and the Spanish bishopric of\r\nUrgel.[391]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Guardians of the marches.]\r\n\r\nOftentimes a state gains by recognizing this freedom-loving spirit of\r\nthe frontier, and by turning it to account for national defence along an\r\nexposed boundary. In consequence of the long wars between Scotland and\r\nEngland, to the Scotch barons having estates near the Border were given\r\nthe Wardenships of the Marches, offices of great power and dignity; and\r\ntheir clans, accustomed only to the imperfect military organization\r\ndemanded by the irregular but persistent hostilities of the time and\r\nplace, developed a lawless spirit. Prohibited from agriculture by their\r\nexposed location, they left their fields waste, and lived by pillage and\r\ncattle-lifting from their English and even their Scotch neighbors. The\r\nvalor of these southern clans, these \"reivers of the Border,\" was the\r\nbulwark of Scotland against the English, but their mutinous spirit\r\nresisted the authority of the king and led them often to erect\r\nsemi-independent principalities.[392]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Border nomads as frontier police.]\r\n\r\nChina has fringed her western boundaries with quasi-independent tribes\r\nwhose autonomy is assured and whose love of freedom is a guarantee of\r\nguerilla warfare against any invader from Central Asia. The Mantze\r\ntribes in the mountain borders of Sze-Chuan province have their own\r\nrulers and customs, and only pay tribute to China.[393] The highlands of\r\nKansu are sprinkled with such independent tribes. Sometimes a definite\r\nbargain is entered into--a self-governing military organization and a\r\nyearly sum of money in return for defence of the frontier. The Mongol\r\ntribes of the Charkar country or \"Borderland\" just outside the Great\r\nWall northwest of Pekin constitute a paid army of the Emperor to guard\r\nthe frontier against the Khalkhas of northern Mongolia, the tribe of\r\nGenghis Khan.[394] Similarly, semi-independent military communities for\r\ncenturies made a continuous line of barriers against the raids of the\r\nsteppe nomads along the southern and southeastern frontiers of Russia,\r\nfrom the Dnieper to the Ural rivers. There were the \"Free Cossacks,\"\r\nlocated on the debatable ground between the fortified frontier of the\r\nagricultural steppe and marauding Crimean Tartars. Nominally subjects of\r\nthe Czar, they obeyed him when it suited them, and on provocation rose\r\nin open revolt. The Cossacks of the Dnieper, who to the middle of the\r\nseventeenth century formed Poland's border defence against Tartar\r\ninvasion, were jealous of any interference with their freedom. They lent\r\ntheir services on occasions to the Sultan of Turkey, and even to the\r\nCrimean Khan; and finally, in 1681, attached themselves and their\r\nterritory to Russia.[395] Here speaks that spirit of defection which is\r\nthe natural product of the remoteness and independence of frontier life.\r\nThe Russians also attached to themselves the Kalmucks located between\r\nthe lower Volga and Don, and used them as a frontier defence against\r\ntheir Tartar and Kirghis neighbors.[396] In this case, as in that of the\r\nCossacks and the Charkars of eastern Mongolia, we have a large body of\r\nmen living in the same arid grassland, leading the same pastoral life,\r\nand carrying on the same kind of warfare as the nomadic marauders whose\r\npillaging, cattle-lifting raids they aim to suppress. The imperial\r\norders to the Charkars limit them strictly to the life of herdmen, with\r\nthe purpose of maintaining their mobility and military efficiency. So in\r\nolden times, for the Don Cossacks agriculture was prohibited on pain of\r\ndeath, lest they should lose their taste for the live-stock booty of a\r\npunitive raid. A still earlier instance of this utilization of border\r\nnomads is found in the first century after Christ, when the Romans made\r\nthe Arabian tribe of Beni Jafre, dwelling on the frontier of Syria, the\r\nwarders of the eastern marches of the Empire.[397]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lawless citizens deported to frontiers.]\r\n\r\nThe advancing frontier of an expanding people often carries them into a\r\nsparsely settled country where the unruly members of society can with\r\nadvantage be utilized as colonists. After centralized and civilized\r\nRussia began to encroach with the plow upon the pastures of the steppe\r\nCossacks, and finally suppressed these military republics, the more\r\nturbulent and obstinate remnants of them she colonized along the Kuban\r\nand Terek rivers, to serve as bulwarks against the incursions of the\r\nCaucasus tribes and as the vanguard of the advance southward.[398]\r\n\r\nThis is one principle underlying the transportation of criminals to the\r\nfrontier. They serve to hold the new country. There these waste elements\r\nof civilization are converted into a useful by-product. They may be only\r\npolitical radicals or religious dissenters: if so, so much the better\r\ncolonial material. The Russian government formerly transported the\r\nrebellious sect of the Molokans or Unitarians to the outskirts of the\r\nEmpire, where the danger of contagion was reduced. Hence they are to be\r\nfound to-day scattered in the Volga province of Samara, on the border of\r\nthe Kirghis steppe, in the Crimea, the Caucasus, and Siberia, still\r\nfaithful and still persecuted.[399] Since 1709 the Russian advance into\r\nSiberia has planted its milestones in settlements formed of prisoners of\r\nwar, political exiles, and worse offenders.[400] Penal colonists located\r\non the shores of Kamchatka helped build and man the crazy boats which\r\nset out for Alaska at the end of the eighteenth century. China settles\r\nits thieves and cheats among the villages of its own border provinces of\r\nShensi[401] and Kansu; but its worst criminals it transports far away to\r\nthe Hi country on the western frontier of the Empire, where they have\r\ndoubtless contributed to the spirit of revolt that has there manifested\r\nitself.[402]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Drift of lawless elements to the frontiers.]\r\n\r\nThe abundance of opportunity and lack of competition in a new frontier\r\ncommunity, its remoteness from the center of authority, and its\r\nimperfect civil government serve to attract thither the vicious, as well\r\nas the sturdy and enterprising. The society of the early Trans-Allegheny\r\nfrontier included both elements. The lawless who drifted to the border\r\nformed gangs of horse thieves, highwaymen, and murderers, who called\r\nforth from the others the summary methods of lynch law.[403] North\r\nCarolina, which in its early history formed the southern frontier of\r\nVirginia, swarmed with ruffians who had fled thither to escape\r\nimprisonment or hanging, and whose general attitude was to resist all\r\nregular authority and especially to pay no taxes.[404] Similarly, that\r\nwide belt of mountain forest which forms the waste boundary between\r\nKorea and Manchuria is the resort of bandits, who have harried both\r\nsides of the border ever since this neutral district was established in\r\nthe thirteenth century.[405] The frontier communities of the Russian\r\nCossacks in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were regular\r\nasylums for runaway serfs and peasants who were fleeing from taxation;\r\ntheir hetmans were repeatedly fugitive criminals. The eastern border of\r\nRussia formed by the Volga basin in 1775 was described as \"an asylum for\r\nmalcontents and vagabonds of all kinds, ruined nobles, disfrocked monks,\r\nmilitary deserters, fugitive serfs, highwaymen, and Volga\r\npirates\"--disorderly elements which contributed greatly to the\r\ninsurrection led by the Ural Cossacks in that year.[406] \"The Debatable\r\nLand,\" a tract between the Esk and Sark rivers, formerly claimed by both\r\nEngland and Scotland, was long the haunt of thieves, outlaws and\r\nvagabonds, as indeed was the whole Border, subject as it was to the\r\nregular jurisdiction of neither side.[407]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Asylums beyond the border.]\r\n\r\nJust beyond the political boundary, where police authority comes to an\r\nend and where pursuit is cut short or retarded, the fleeing criminal\r\nfinds his natural asylum. Hence all border districts tend to harbor\r\nundesirable refugees from the other side. Deserters and outlaws from\r\nChina proper sprinkle the eastern districts of Mongolia.[408] Marauding\r\nbands of Apaches and Sioux, after successful depredations on American\r\nranches, for years fled across the line into Mexico and Canada before\r\nthe hammering hoof-beats of Texas Ranger and United States cavalry,\r\nuntil a treaty with Mexico in 1882, authorizing such armed pursuit to\r\ncross the boundary, cut off at least one asylum.[409] Our country\r\nexchanges other undesirable citizens with its northern and southern\r\nneighbors in cases where no extradition treaty provides for their\r\nreturn; and the borders of the individual states are crossed and\r\nrecrossed by shifty gentlemen seeking to dodge the arm of the law. The\r\nfact that so many State boundaries fall in the Southern Appalachians,\r\nwhere illicit distilling and feud murders provide most of the cases on\r\nthe docket, has materially retarded the suppression of these crimes by\r\nincreasing the difficulty both of apprehending the offender and of\r\nsubpoenaing the reluctant witness.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Border refugees and ethnic mingling.]\r\n\r\nDissatisfied, oppressed, or persecuted members of a political community\r\nare prone to seek an asylum across the nearest border, where happier or\r\nfreer conditions of life are promised. There they contribute to that\r\nmixture of race which characterizes every boundary zone, though as an\r\nembittered people they may also help to emphasize any existing political\r\nor religious antagonism. The Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685\r\nwas followed by an exodus of Huguenots from France to the Protestant\r\nstates of Switzerland, the Palatinate of the Rhine, and Holland, as also\r\nacross the Channel into southern England; just as in recent years the\r\nSlav borderland of eastern Germany has received a large immigration of\r\nPolish Jews from Russia. When the Polish king in 1571 executed the\r\nleader of the Dnieper Cossacks, thousands of these bold borderers left\r\ntheir country and joined the community of the Don; and in 1722 after the\r\nDnieper community had been crushed by Peter the Great, a similar exodus\r\ntook place across the southern boundary into the Crimea, whereby the\r\nTartar horde was strengthened, just as a few years before, during an\r\nunsuccessful revolt of the Don Cossacks, some two thousand of the\r\nmalcontents crossed the southern frontier to the Kuban River in\r\nCircassia.[410] The establishment of American independence in 1783 saw an\r\nexodus of loyalists from the United States into the contiguous districts\r\nof Ontario, New Brunswick, and Spanish Florida, Five years later\r\ndiscontent with the Federal Government for its dilatory opposition to\r\nthe occlusion of the Mississippi and the lure of commercial betterment\r\nsent many citizens of the early Trans-Allegheny commonwealths to the\r\nSpanish side of the Mississippi,[411] while the Natchez District on the\r\neast bank of the river contained a sprinkling of French who had become\r\ndissatisfied with Spanish rule in Louisiana and changed their domicile.\r\n\r\nThese are some of the movements of individuals and groups which\r\ncontribute to the blending of races along every frontier, and make of\r\nthe boundary a variable zone, as opposed to the rigid artificial line in\r\nterms of which we speak.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n[326] A.W.

The coast, in its physical nature, is a zone of transition\r\nbetween these two dominant forms of the earth's surface; it bears the\r\nmark of their contending forces, varying in its width with every\r\nstronger onslaught of the unresting sea, and with every degree of\r\npassive resistance made by granite or sandy shore. So too in an\r\nanthropo-geographical sense, it is a zone of transition. Now the\r\nlife-supporting forces of the land are weak in it, and it becomes merely\r\nthe rim of the sea; for its inhabitants the sea means food, clothes,\r\nshelter, fuel, commerce, highway, and opportunity. Now the coast is\r\ndominated by the exuberant forces of a productive soil, so that the\r\nocean beyond is only a turbulent waste and a long-drawn barrier: the\r\ncoast is the hem of the land. Neither influence can wholly exclude the\r\nother in this amphibian belt, for the coast remains the intermediary\r\nbetween the habitable expanse of the land and the international highway\r\nof the sea. The break of the waves and the dash of the spray draw the\r\nline beyond which human dwellings cannot spread; for these the shore is\r\nthe outermost limit, as for ages also in the long infancy of the races,\r\nbefore the invention of boat and sail, it drew the absolute boundary to\r\nhuman expansion. In historical order, its first effect has been that of\r\na barrier, and for the majority of peoples this it has remained; but\r\nwith the development of navigation and the spread of human activities\r\nfrom the land over sea to other countries, it became the gateway both of\r\nland and sea--at once the outlet for exploration, colonization, and\r\ntrade, and the open door through which a continent or island receives\r\ncontributions of men or races or ideas from transoceanic shores. Barrier\r\nand threshold: these are the _rôles_ which coasts have always played in\r\nhistory. To-day we see them side by side. But in spite of the immense\r\nproportions assumed by transmarine intercourse, the fact remains that\r\nthe greater part of the coasts of the earth are for their inhabitants\r\nonly a barrier and not an outlet, or at best only a base for timorous\r\nventures seaward that rarely lose sight of the shore.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GERMAN NORTH SEA COAST.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Width of coastal zones.]\r\n\r\nAs intermediary belt between land and sea, the coast becomes a peculiar\r\nhabitat which leaves its mark upon its people. We speak of coast strips,\r\ncoastal plains, \"tidewater country,\" coast cities; of coast tribes,\r\ncoast peoples, maritime colonies; and each word brings up a picture of a\r\nland or race or settlement permeated by the influences of the sea. The\r\nold term of \"coastline\" has no application to such an intermediary belt,\r\nfor it is a zone of measurable width; and this width varies with the\r\nrelief of the land, the articulation of the coast according as it is\r\nuniform or complex, with the successive stages of civilization and the\r\ndevelopment of navigation among the people who inhabit it.\r\n\r\nAlong highly articulated coasts, showing the interpenetration of sea and\r\nland in a broad band of capes and islands separated by tidal channels\r\nand inlets, or on shores deeply incised by river estuaries, or on low\r\nshelving beaches which screen brackish lagoons and salt marshes behind\r\nsand reefs and dune ramparts, and which thus form an indeterminate\r\nboundary of alternate land and water, the zone character of the coast in\r\na physical sense becomes conspicuous. In an anthropological sense the\r\nzone character is clearly indicated by the different uses of its inner\r\nand outer edge made by man in different localities and in different\r\nperiods of history.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The inner edge.]\r\n\r\nThe old German maritime cities of the North Sea and the Baltic were\r\nlocated on rivers from 6 to 60 miles from the open sea, always on the\r\ninner edge of the coastal belt. Though primarily trading towns, linked\r\ntogether once in the sovereign confederacy of the Hanseatic League, they\r\nfixed their sites on the last spurs of firm ground running out into the\r\nsoft, yielding alluvium, which was constantly exposed to inundation.\r\nLand high enough to be above the ever threatening flood of river and\r\nstorm-driven tide on this flat coast, and solid enough to be built upon,\r\ncould not be found immediately on the sea. The slight elevations of\r\nsandy \"geest\" or detrital spurs were limited in area and in time\r\noutgrown. Hence the older part of all these river towns, from Bremen to\r\nKönigsberg, rests upon hills, while in every case the newer and lower\r\npart is built on piles or artificially raised ground on the alluvium.[412]\r\nSo Utrecht, the Ultrajectum of the Romans, selected for its site a long\r\nraised spur running out from the solid ground of older and higher land\r\ninto the water-soaked alluvium of the Netherlands. It was the most\r\nimportant town of all this region before the arts of civilization began\r\nthe conquest by dike and ditch of the amphibian coastal belt which now\r\ncomprises one-fourth of the area and holds one-half the population of\r\nthe Netherlands.[413] So ancient London marked the solid ground at the\r\ninner edge of the tidal flats and desolate marshes which lined the\r\nThames estuary, as the Roman Camulodunum and its successor Colchester on\r\nits steep rise or _dun_ overlooked the marshes of the Stour inlet.[414]\r\nFarther north about the Wash, which in Roman days extended far inland\r\nover an area of fens and tidal channels, Cambridge on the River Cam,\r\nHuntingdon and Stamford on the Nen, and Lincoln on the Witham--all river\r\nseaports--defined the firm inner edge of this wide low coast. In the\r\nsame way the landward rim of the tidal waters and salt marshes of the\r\nHumber inlet was described by a semicircle of British and Roman\r\ntowns--Doncaster, Castleford, Todcaster, and York.[415] On the flat or\r\nrolling West African coastland, which lines the long shores of the Gulf\r\nof Guinea with a band 30 to 100 miles wide, the sandy, swampy tracts\r\nimmediately on the sea are often left uninhabited; native population is\r\ndistributed most frequently at the limit of deep water, and here at head\r\nof ship-navigation the trading towns are found.[416]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Inner edge as head of sea navigation.]\r\n\r\nWhile, on low coasts at any rate, the inner edge tends to mark the limit\r\nof settlement advancing from the interior, as the head of sea navigation\r\non river and inlet it has also been the goal of immigrant settlers from\r\noversea lands. The history of modern maritime colonization, especially\r\nin America, shows that the aim of regular colonists, as opposed to mere\r\ntraders, has been to penetrate as far as possible into the land while\r\nretaining communication with the sea, and thereby with the mother\r\ncountry. The small boats in use till the introduction of steam\r\nnavigation fixed this line far inland and gave the coastal zone a\r\ngreater breadth than it has at present, and a more regular contour. In\r\ncolonial America this inner edge coincided with the \"fall-line\" of the\r\nAtlantic rivers, which was indicated by a series of seaport towns; or\r\nwith the inland limit of the tides, which on the St. Lawrence fell above\r\nQuebec, and on the Hudson just below Albany.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Shifting of the inner edge.]\r\n\r\nWith the recent increase in the size of vessels, two contrary effects\r\nare noticed. In the vast majority of cases, the inner edge, as marked by\r\nports, moves seaward into deeper water, and the zone narrows. The days\r\nwhen almost every tobacco plantation in tidewater Virginia had its own\r\nwharf are long since past, and the leaf is now exported by way of\r\nNorfolk and Baltimore. Seville has lost practically all its sea trade to\r\nCadiz, Rouen to Havre, and Dordrecht to Rotterdam. In other cases the\r\nzone preserves its original width by the creation of secondary ports on\r\nor near the outer edge, reserved only for the largest vessels, while the\r\ninner harbor, by dredging its channel, improves its communication with\r\nthe sea. Thus arises the phenomenon of twin ports like Bremen and\r\nBremerhaven, Dantzig and Neufahrwasser, Stettin and Swinemünde, Bordeaux\r\nand Pauillac, London and Tilbury. Or the original harbor seeks to\r\npreserve its advantage by canalizing the shallow approach by river,\r\nlagoon, or bay, as St. Petersburg by the Pantiloff canal through the\r\nshallow reaches of Kronstadt Bay; or Königsberg by its ship canal,\r\ncarried for 25 miles across the Frisches Haff to the Baltic;[417] or\r\nNantes by the Loire ship canal, which in 1892 was built to regain for\r\nthe old town the West Indian trade recently intercepted by the rising\r\nouter port of St. Nazaire, at the mouth of the Loire estuary.[418] In\r\nnorthern latitudes, however, the outer ports on enclosed sea basins like\r\nthe Baltic become dominant in the winter, when the inner ports are\r\nice-bound. Otherwise the outer port sinks with every improvement in the\r\nchannel between the inner port and the sea. Hamburg has so constantly\r\ndeepened the Elbe passage that its outport of Cuxhaven has had little\r\nchance to rise, and serves only as an emergency harbor; while on the\r\nWeser, maritime leadership has oscillated between Bremen and\r\nBremerhaven.[419] So the whole German coast and the Russian Baltic have\r\nseen a more or less irregular shifting backward and forward of maritime\r\nimportance between the inner and the outer edges.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Artificial extension of inner edge.]\r\n\r\nThe width of the coast zone is not only prevented from contracting by\r\ndredging and canaling, but it is even increased. By deepening the\r\nchannel, the chief port of the St. Lawrence River has been removed from\r\nQuebec 180 miles upstream to Montreal, and that of the Clyde from Port\r\nGlasgow 16 miles to Glasgow itself, so that now the largest ocean\r\nsteamers come to dock where fifty years ago children waded across the\r\nstream at ebb tide. Such artificial modifications, however, are rare,\r\nfor they are made only where peculiarly rich resources or superior lines\r\nof communication with the hinterland justify the expenditures; but they\r\nfind their logical conclusion in still farther extensions of sea\r\nnavigation into the interior by means of ship canals, where previously\r\nno waterway existed. Instances are found in the Manchester ship canal\r\nand the Welland, which, by means of the St. Lawrence and the Great\r\nLakes, makes Chicago accessible to ocean vessels. Though man\r\ndistinguishes between sea and inland navigation in his definitions, in\r\nhis practice he is bound by no formula and recognizes no fundamental\r\ndifference where rivers, lakes, and canals are deep enough to admit his\r\nsea-going craft.\r\n\r\nSuch deep landward protrusions of the head of marine navigation at\r\ncertain favored points, as opposed to its recent coastward trend in most\r\ninlets and rivers, increase the irregularity of the inner edge of the\r\ncoast zone by the marked discrepancy between its maximum and minimum\r\nwidth. They are limited, however, to a few highly civilized countries,\r\nand to a few points in those countries. But their presence testifies to\r\nthe fact that the evolution of the coast zone with the development of\r\ncivilization shows the persistent importance of this inner edge.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Outer edge in original settlement.]\r\n\r\nThe outer edge finds its greatest significance, which is for the most\r\npart ephemeral, in the earlier stages of navigation, maritime\r\ncolonization, and in some cases of original settlement. But this\r\nimportance persists only on steep coasts furnishing little or no level\r\nground for cultivation and barred from interior hunting or grazing land;\r\non many coral and volcanic islands of the Pacific Ocean whose outer rim\r\nhas the most fertile soil and furnishes the most abundant growth of coco\r\npalms, and whose limited area only half suffices to support the\r\npopulation; and in polar and sub-polar districts, where harsh climatic\r\nconditions set a low limit to economic development. In all these regions\r\nthe sea must provide most of the food of the inhabitants, who can\r\ntherefore never lose contact with its waters. In mountainous Tierra del\r\nFuego, whose impenetrably forested slopes rise directly from the sea,\r\nwith only here and there a scanty stretch of stony beach, the natives of\r\nthe southern and western coasts keep close to the shore. The straits and\r\nchannels yield them all their food, and are the highways for all their\r\nrestless, hungry wanderings.[420] The steep slopes and dense forests\r\npreclude travel by land, and force the wretched inhabitants to live as\r\nmuch in their canoes as in their huts. The Tlingit and Haida Indians of\r\nthe mountainous coast of southern Alaska locate their villages on some\r\nsmooth sheltered beach, with their houses in a single row facing the\r\nwater, and the ever-ready canoe drawn up on shore in front. They select\r\ntheir sites with a view to food supply, and to protection in case of\r\nattack. On the treeless shores of Kadiak Island and of the long narrow\r\nAlaska Peninsula near by, the Eskimo choose their village location for\r\nan accumulation of driftwood, for proximity to their food supply, and a\r\nlanding-place for their kayaks and bidarkas. Hence they prefer a point\r\nof land or gravel spit extending out into the sea, or a sand reef\r\nseparating a salt-water lagoon from the open sea. The Aleutian Islanders\r\nregard only accessibility to the shell-fish on the beach and their\r\npelagic hunting and fishing; and this consideration has influenced the\r\nEskimo tribes of the wide Kuskokwin estuary to such an extent, that they\r\nplace their huts only a few feet above ordinary high tide, where they\r\nare constantly exposed to overflow from the sea.[421] Only among the\r\ngreat tidal channels of the Yukon delta are they distributed over the\r\nwhole wide coastal zone, even to its inner edge.\r\n\r\nThe coast Chukches of northeastern Siberia locate their tent villages on\r\nthe sand ramparts between the Arctic Ocean and the freshwater lagoons\r\nwhich line this low tundra shore. Here they are conveniently situated\r\nfor fishing and hunting marine animals, while protected against the\r\nsummer inundations of the Arctic rivers.[422] The whole western side of\r\nGreenland, from far northern Upernivik south to Cape Farewell, shows\r\nboth Eskimo and Danish settlements almost without exception on\r\nprojecting points of peninsulas or islands, where the stronger effect of\r\nthe warm ocean current, as well as proximity to the food supply, serve\r\nto fix their habitations; although the remains of the old Norse\r\nsettlements in general are found in sheltered valleys with summer\r\nvegetation, striking off from the fiords some 20 miles back from the\r\nouter coast.[423] Cæsar found that the ancient Veneti, an immigrant\r\npeople of the southern coast of Brittany, built their towns on the\r\npoints of capes and promontories, sites which gave them ready contact\r\nwith the sea and protection against attack from the land side, because\r\nevery rise of the tide submerged the intervening lowlands.[424] Here a\r\nsterile plateau hinterland drove them for part of their subsistence to\r\nthe water, and the continuous intertribal warfare of small primitive\r\nstates to the sea-girt asylums of the capes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Outer edge in early navigation.]\r\n\r\nIn the early history of navigation and exploration, striking features of\r\nthis outer coast edge, like headlands and capes, became important sea\r\nmarks. The promontory of Mount Athos, rising 6,400 feet above the sea\r\nbetween the Hellespont and the Thessalian coast, and casting its shadow\r\nas far as the market-place of Lemnos, was a guiding point for mariners\r\nin the whole northern Aegean.[425] For the ancient Greeks Cape Malia was\r\nlong the boundary stone to the unknown wastes of the western\r\nMediterranean, just as later the Pillars of Hercules marked the portals\r\nto the _mare tenebrosum_ of the stormy Atlantic. So the Sacred\r\nPromontory (Cape St. Vincent) of the Iberian Peninsula defined for\r\nGreeks and Romans the southwestern limit of the habitable world.[426]\r\nCenturies later the Portuguese marked their advance down the west coast\r\nof Africa, first by Cape Non, which so long said \"No!\" to the struggling\r\nmariner, then by Cape Bojador, and finally by Cape Verde.\r\n\r\nIn coastwise navigation, minor headlands and inshore islands were points\r\nto steer by; and in that early maritime colonization, which had chiefly\r\na commercial aim, they formed the favorite spots for trading stations.\r\nThe Phoenicians in their home country fixed their settlements by\r\npreference on small capes, like Sidon and Berytus, or on inshore\r\nislets, like Tyre and Aradus,[427] and for their colonies and trading\r\nstations they chose similar sites, whether on the coast of Sicily,[428]\r\nSpain, or Morocco.[429] Carthage was located on a small hill-crowned cape\r\nprojecting out into the Bay of Carthage. The two promontories embracing\r\nthis inlet were edged with settlements, especially the northern arm,\r\nwhich held Utica and Hippo,[430] the latter on the site of the modern\r\nFrench naval station of Bizerta.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF ANCIENT PHOENICIAN AND GREEK COLONIES.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Outer edge and piracy.]\r\n\r\nIn this early Hellenic world, when Greek sea-power was in its infancy,\r\nowing to the fear of piracy, cities were placed a few miles back from\r\nthe coast; but with the partial cessation of this evil, sites on shore\r\nand peninsula were preferred as being more accessible to commerce,[431]\r\nand such of the older towns as were in comparatively easy reach of the\r\nseaboard established there each its own port. Thus we find the ancient\r\nurban pairs of Argos and Nauplia, Troezene and Pogon, Mycenæ and\r\nEiones, Corinth commanding its Aegean port of Cenchreæ 8 miles away on\r\nthe Saronic Gulf to catch the Asiatic trade, and connected by a walled\r\nthoroughfare a mile and a half long with Lechæum, a second harbor on\r\nthe Corinthian Gulf which served the Italian commerce.[432] In the same\r\ngroup belonged Athens and its Piræus, Megara and Pegæ, Pergamus and\r\nElaæ in western Asia Minor.[433] These ancient twin cities may be taken\r\nto mark the two borders of the coast zone. Like the modern ones which we\r\nhave considered above, their historical development has shown an advance\r\nfrom the inner toward the outer edge, though owing to different causes.\r\nHowever, the retired location of the Baltic and North Sea towns of\r\nGermany served as a partial protection against the pirates who, in the\r\nMiddle Ages, scoured these coasts.[434] Lubeck, originally located nearer\r\nthe sea than at present, and frequently demolished by them, was finally\r\nrebuilt farther inland up the Trave River.[435] Later the port of\r\nTravemünde grew up at the mouth of the little estuary.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Outer edge in colonization.]\r\n\r\nThe early history of maritime colonization shows in general two\r\ngeographic phases: first, the appropriation of the islet and headland\r\noutskirts of the seaboard, and later--it may be much later--an advance\r\ntoward the inner edge of the coast, or yet farther into the interior.\r\nProgress from the earlier to the maturer phase depends upon the social\r\nand economic development of the colonizers, as reflected in their\r\nvaluation of territorial area. The first phase, the outcome of a low\r\nestimate of the value of land, is best represented by the Phoenician and\r\nearliest Greek colonies, whose purposes were chiefly commercial, and who\r\nsought merely such readily accessible coastal points as furnished the\r\nbest trading stations on the highway of the Mediterranean and the\r\nadjacent seas. The earlier Greek colonies, like those of the Triopium\r\npromontory forming the south-western angle of Asia Minor, Chalcidice,\r\nthe Thracian Chersonesus, Calchedon, Byzantium, the Pontic Heraclea, and\r\nSinope, were situated on peninsulas or headlands, that would afford a\r\nconvenient anchor ground; or, like Syracuse and Mitylene, on small\r\ninshore islets, which were soon outgrown, and from which the towns then\r\nspread to the mainland near by. The advantages of such sites lay in\r\ntheir accessibility to commerce, and in their natural protection against\r\nthe attack of strange or hostile mainland tribes. For a nation of\r\nmerchants, satisfied with the large returns but also with the ephemeral\r\npower of middlemen, these considerations sufficed. While the Phoenician\r\ntrading posts in Africa dotted the outer rim of the coast, the inner\r\nedge of the zone was indicated by Libyan or Ethiopian towns, where the\r\ninhabitants of the interior bartered their ivory and skins for the\r\nproducts of Tyre.[436] So that commercial expansion of the Arabs down the\r\neast coast of Africa in the first and again in the tenth century seized\r\nupon the offshore islands of Zanzibar, Pemba, and Mafia, the small\r\ninshore islets like Mombasa and Lamu, and the whole outer rim of the\r\ncoast from the equator southward to the Rovuma River.[437] The Sultan of\r\nZanzibar, heir to this coastal strip, had not expanded it a decade ago,\r\nwhen he had to relinquish the long thread of his continental\r\npossessions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Inland advance of colonies.]\r\n\r\nBut when a people has advanced to a higher conception of colonization as\r\nan outlet for national as well as commercial expansion, and when it sees\r\nthat the permanent prosperity of both race and trade in the new locality\r\ndepends upon the occupation of larger tracts of territory and the\r\ndevelopment of local resources as a basis for exchanges, their\r\nsettlements spread from the outer rim of the coasts to its inner edge\r\nand yet beyond, if alluvial plains and river highways are present to\r\ntempt inland expansion. Such was the history of many later colonies of\r\nthe Greeks[438] and Carthaginians, and especially of most modern colonial\r\nmovements, for these have been dominated by a higher estimate of the\r\nvalue of land.\r\n\r\nAfter the long Atlantic journey, the outposts of the American coast were\r\nwelcome resting-places to the early European voyagers, but, owing to\r\ntheir restricted area and therefore limited productivity, they were soon\r\nabandoned, or became mere bases for inland expansion. The little island\r\nof Cuttyhunk, off southern Massachusetts, was the site of Gosnold's\r\nabortive attempt at colonization in 1602, like Raleigh's attempt on\r\nRoanoke Island in 1585, and the later one of Popham on the eastern\r\nheadland of Casco Bay. The Pilgrims paused at the extremity of Cape Cod,\r\nand again on Clark's Island, before fixing their settlement on Plymouth\r\nBay. Monhegan Island, off the Maine coast, was the site of an early\r\nEnglish trading post, which, however, lasted only from 1623 to 1626;[439]\r\nand the same dates fix the beginning and end of a fishing and trading\r\nstation established on Cape Ann, and removed later to Salem harbor. The\r\nSwedes made their first settlement in America on Cape Henlopen, at the\r\nentrance of Delaware Bay; but their next, only seven years later, they\r\nlocated well up the estuary of the Delaware River. Thus for the modern\r\ncolonist the outer edge of the coast is merely the gateway of the land.\r\nFrom it he passes rapidly to the settlement of the interior, wherever\r\nfertile soil and abundant resources promise a due return upon his labor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Interpenetration of land and sea.]\r\n\r\nSince it is from the land, as the inhabited portion of the earth's\r\nsurface, that all maritime movements emanate, and to the land that all\r\noversea migrations are directed, the reciprocal relations between land\r\nand sea are largely determined by the degree of accessibility existing\r\nbetween the two. This depends primarily upon the articulation of a\r\nland-mass, whether it presents an unbroken contour like Africa and\r\nIndia, or whether, like Europe and Norway, it drops a fringe of\r\npeninsulas and a shower of islands into the bordering ocean. Mere\r\ndistance from the sea bars a country from its vivifying contact; every\r\nprotrusion of an ocean artery into the heart of a continent makes that\r\nheart feel the pulse of life on far-off, unseen shores. The Baltic inlet\r\nwhich makes a seaport of St. Petersburg 800 miles (1,300 kilometers)\r\nback from the western rim of Europe, brings Atlantic civilization to\r\nthis half-Asiatic side of the continent. The solid front presented by\r\nthe Iberian Peninsula and Africa to the Atlantic has a narrow crack at\r\nGibraltar, whence the Mediterranean penetrates inland 2,300 miles (3,700\r\nkilometers), and converts the western foot of the Caucasus and the roots\r\nof the Lebanon Mountains into a seaboard. By means of the Arabian Sea,\r\nthe Indian Ocean runs northward 1,300 miles (2,200 kilometers) from Cape\r\nComorin to meet the Indus delta; and then turns westward 700 miles\r\nfarther through the Oman and Persian gulfs to receive the boats from the\r\nTigris and Euphrates. Such marine inlets create islands and peninsulas;\r\nwhich are characterized by proximity to the sea on all or many sides;\r\nand in the interior of the continents they produce every degree of\r\nnearness, shading off into inaccessible remoteness from the watery\r\nhighway of the deep.\r\n\r\nThe success with which such indentations open up the interior of the\r\ncontinents depends upon the length of the inlets and the size of the\r\nland-mass in question. Africa's huge area and unbroken contour combine\r\nto hold the sea at arm's length, Europe's deep-running inlets open that\r\nsmall continent so effectively that Kazan, Russia's most eastern city of\r\nconsiderable size, is only 750 miles (1,200 kilometers) distant from the\r\nnearest White Sea, Baltic, and Azof ports. Asia, the largest of all the\r\ncontinents, despite a succession of big indentations that invade its\r\nperiphery from Sinai peninsula to East Cape, has a vast inland area\r\nhopelessly far from the surrounding oceans.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ratio of shoreline to area.]\r\n\r\nIn order to determine the coast articulation of any country or\r\ncontinent, Carl Ritter and his followers divided area by shoreline, the\r\nlatter a purely mathematical line representing the total contour length.\r\nBy this method Europe's ratio is one linear mile of coast to 174 square\r\nmiles of area, Australia's 1:224, Asia's 1:490, and Africa's 1:700. This\r\nmeans that Europe's proportion of coast is three times that of Asia and\r\nfour times that of Africa; that a country like Norway, with a shoreline\r\nof 12,000 miles traced in and out along the fiords and around the larger\r\nislands,[440] has only 10 square miles of area for every mile of\r\nseaboard, while Germany, with every detail of its littoral included in\r\nthe measurement, has only 1,515 miles of shoreline and a ratio of one\r\nmile of coast to every 159 square miles of area.\r\n\r\nThe criticism has been made against this method that it compares two\r\nunlike measures, square and linear, which moreover increase or decrease\r\nin markedly different degrees, according as larger or smaller units are\r\nused. But for the purposes of anthropo-geography the method is valid,\r\ninasmuch as it shows the amount of area dependent for its marine outline\r\nupon each mile of littoral. A coast, like every other boundary, performs\r\nthe important function of intermediary in the intercourse of a land with\r\nits neighbors; hence the length of this sea boundary materially affects\r\nthis function. Area and coastline are not dead mathematical quantities,\r\nbut like organs of one body stand in close reciprocal activity, and can\r\nbe understood only in the light of their persistent mutual relations.\r\nThe division of the area of a land by the length of its coastline yields\r\na quotient which to the anthropo-geographer is not a dry figure, but an\r\nindex to the possible relations between seaboard and interior. A\r\ncomparison of some of these ratios will illustrate this fact.\r\n\r\nGermany's shoreline, traced in contour without including details,\r\nmeasures 787 miles; this is just one-fifth that of Italy and two-fifths\r\nthat of France, so that it is short. But since Germany's area is nearly\r\ntwice Italy's and a little larger than that of France, it has 267 square\r\nmiles of territory for every mile of coast, while Italy has only 28\r\nsquare miles, and France 106. Germany has towns that are 434 miles from\r\nthe nearest seaboard, but in Italy the most inland point is only 148\r\nmiles from the Mediterranean.[441] If we turn now to the United States\r\nand adopt Mendenhall's estimate of its general or contour coastline as\r\n5,705 miles, we find that our country has 530 square miles of area\r\ndependent for its outlet upon each mile of seaboard. This means that our\r\ncoast has a heavy task imposed upon it, and that its commercial and\r\npolitical importance is correspondingly enhanced; that the extension of\r\nour Gulf of Mexico littoral by the purchase of Florida and the\r\nannexation of Texas were measures of self-preservation, and that the\r\nunbroken contour and mountain-walled face of our Pacific littoral is a\r\nserious national handicap.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Criticism of this formula.]\r\n\r\nBut this method is open to the legitimate and fundamental criticism\r\nthat, starting from the conception of a coast as a mere line instead of\r\na zone, it ignores all those features which belong to every littoral as\r\na strip of the earth's surface--location, geologic structure, relief,\r\narea, accessibility to the sea in front and to the land behind, all\r\nwhich vary from one part of the world's seaboard to another, and serve\r\nto differentiate the human history of every littoral. Moreover, of all\r\nparts of the earth's surface, the coast as the hem of the sea and land,\r\ncombining the characters of each, is most complex. It is the coast as a\r\nhuman habitat that primarily concerns anthropo-geography. A careful\r\nanalysis of the multifarious influences modifying one another in this\r\nmingled environment of land and water reveals an intricate interplay of\r\ngeographic forces, varying from inland basin to marginal sea, from\r\nmarginal sea to open ocean, and changing from one historical period to\r\nanother--an interplay so mercurial that it could find only a most\r\ninadequate expression in the rigid mathematical formula of Carl Ritter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Accessibility of coasts from hinterland.]\r\n\r\nAs the coast, then, is the border zone between the solid, inhabited land\r\nand the mobile, untenanted deep, two important factors in its history\r\nare the accessibility of its back country on the one hand, and the\r\naccessibility of the sea on the other. A littoral population barred from\r\nits hinterland by mountain range or steep plateau escarpment or desert\r\ntract feels little influence from the land; level or fertile soil is too\r\nlimited in amount to draw inland the growing people, intercourse is too\r\ndifficult and infrequent, transportation too slow and costly. Hence the\r\ninhabitants of such a coast are forced to look seaward for their racial\r\nand commercial expansion, even if a paucity of good harbors limits the\r\naccessibility of the sea; they must lead a somewhat detached and\r\nindependent existence, so far as the territory behind them is concerned.\r\nHere the coast, as a peripheral organ of the interior, as the outlet\r\nfor its products, the market for its foreign exchanges, and the medium\r\nfor intercourse with its maritime neighbors, sees its special function\r\nimpaired. But it takes advantage of its isolation and the protection of\r\na long sea boundary to detach itself politically from its hinterland, as\r\nthe histories of Phoenicia, the Aegean coast of Asia Minor, Dalmatia,\r\nthe republics of Amalfi, Venice, and Genoa, the county of Barcelona, and\r\nPortugal abundantly prove. At the same time it profits by its seaboard\r\nlocation to utilize the more varied fields of maritime enterprise before\r\nit, in lieu of the more or less forbidden territory behind it. The\r\nheight and width of the landward barrier, the number and practicability\r\nof the passways across it, and especially the value of the hinterland's\r\nproducts in relation to their bulk, determine the amount of intercourse\r\nbetween that hinterland and its mountain or desert barred littoral.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mountain-barred hinterlands.]\r\n\r\nThe interior is most effectively cut off from the periphery, where a\r\nmountain range or a plateau escarpment traces the inner line of the\r\ncoastland, as in the province of Liguria in northern Italy, Dalmatia,\r\nthe western or Malabar coast of India, most parts of Africa, and long\r\nstretches of the Pacific littoral of the Americas. The highland that\r\nbacks the Norwegian coast is crossed by only one railroad, that passing\r\nthrough the Trondhjem depression; and this barrier has served to keep\r\nNorway's historical connection with Sweden far less intimate than with\r\nDenmark. The long inlet of the Adriatic, bringing the sea well into the\r\nheart of Southern Europe, has seen nevertheless a relatively small\r\nmaritime development, owing to the wall of mountains that everywhere\r\nshuts out the hinterland of its coasts. The greatness of Venice was\r\nintimately connected with the Brenner Pass over the Alps on the one\r\nhand, and the trade of the eastern Mediterranean on the other. Despite\r\nAustro-Hungary's crucial interest in the northeast corner of the\r\nAdriatic as a maritime outlet for this vast inland empire, and its\r\nherculean efforts at Trieste and Fiume to create harbors and to connect\r\nthem by transmontane railroads with the valley of the Danube, the\r\nmaritime development of this coast is still restricted, and much of\r\nAustria's trade goes out northward by German ports.[442] Farther south\r\nalong the Dalmatian and Albanian coasts, the deep and sheltered bays\r\nbetween the half-submerged roots of the Dinaric Alps have developed only\r\nlocal importance, because they lack practicable connection with the\r\ninterior. This was their history too in early Greek and Roman days, for\r\nthey found only scant support in the few caravans that crossed by the\r\nRoman road to Dyrrachium to exchange the merchandise of the Aegean for\r\nthe products of the Ionian Isles. Spain has always suffered from the\r\nfact that her bare, arid, and unproductive tableland almost everywhere\r\nrises steeply from her fertile and densely populated coasts; and\r\ntherefore that the two have been unable to coöperate either for the\r\nproduction of a large maritime commerce or for national political unity.\r\nHere the diverse conditions of the littoral and the wall of the great\r\ncentral terrace of the country have emphasized that tendency to\r\ndefection that belongs to every periphery, and therefore necessitated a\r\nstrong centralized government to consolidate the restive maritime\r\nprovinces with their diverse Galician, Basque, Catalonian, and\r\nAndalusian folk into one nation with the Castilians of the plateau.[443]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Accessible hinterlands.]\r\n\r\nWhere mountain systems run out endwise into the sea, the longitudinal\r\nvalleys with their drainage streams open natural highways from the\r\ninterior to the coast. This structure has made the Atlantic side of the\r\nIberian Peninsula far more open than its Mediterranean front, and\r\ntherefore contributed to its leadership in maritime affairs since 1450.\r\nSo from the shores of Thrace to the southern point of the Peloponnesus,\r\nall the valleys of Greece open out on the eastern or Asiatic side. Here\r\nevery mountain-flanked bay has had its own small hinterland to draw\r\nupon, and every such interior has been accessible to the civilization of\r\nthe Aegean; here was concentrated the maritime and cultural life of\r\nHellas.[444] The northern half of Andean Colombia, by way of the parallel\r\nAtrato, Rio Cauco, and Magdalena valleys, has supported the activities\r\nof its Caribbean littoral, and through these avenues has received such\r\nforeign influences as might penetrate to inland Bogota. In like manner,\r\nthe mountain-ridged peninsula of Farther India keeps its interior in\r\ntouch with its leading ports through its intermontane valleys of the\r\nIrawadi, Salwin, Menam, and Mekong rivers.\r\n\r\nLow coasts rising by easy gradients to wide plains, like those of\r\nnorthern France, Germany, southern Russia, and the Gulf seaboard of the\r\nUnited States, profit by an accessible and extensive hinterland.\r\nOccasionally, however, this advantage is curtailed by a political\r\nboundary reinforced by a high protective tariff, as Holland, Belgium,\r\nand East Prussia[445] know to their sorrow.\r\n\r\nThese low hems of the land, however, often meet physical obstructions to\r\nready communications with the interior in the silted inlets, shallow\r\nlagoons, marshes, or mangrove swamps of the littoral itself. Here the\r\nlarger drainage streams give access across this amphibian belt to the\r\nsolid land behind. Where they flow into a tide-swept bay like the North\r\nSea or the English Channel, they scour out their beds and preserve the\r\nconnection between sea and land;[446] but debouchment into a tideless\r\nbasin like the Caspian or the Gulf of Mexico, even for such mighty\r\nstreams as the Volga and the Mississippi, sees the slow silting up of\r\ntheir mouths and the restriction of their agency in opening up the\r\nhinterland. Thus the character of the bordering sea may help to\r\ndetermine the accessibility of the coast from the land side.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Accessibility of coasts from the sea.]\r\n\r\nIts accessibility from the sea depends primarily upon its degree of\r\narticulation; and this articulation depends upon whether the littoral\r\nbelt has suffered elevation or subsidence. When the inshore sea rests\r\nupon an uplifted bottom, the contour of the coast is smooth and\r\nunbroken, because most of the irregularities of surface have been\r\noverlaid by a deposit of waste from the land; so it offers no harbor\r\nexcept here and there a silted river mouth, while it shelves off through\r\na broad amphibian belt of tidal marsh, lagoon, and sand reef to a\r\nshallow sea. Such is the coast of New Jersey, most of the Gulf seaboard\r\nof the United States and Mexico, the Coromandel coast of India, and the\r\nlong, low littoral of Upper Guinea. Such coasts harbor a population of\r\nfishermen living along the strands of their placid lagoons,[447] and\r\nstimulate a timid inshore navigation which sometimes develops to\r\nextensive coastwise intercourse, where a network of lagoons and deltaic\r\nchannels forms a long inshore passage, as in Upper Guinea, but which\r\nfears the break of the surf outside.[448]\r\n\r\nThe rivers draining these low uplifted lands are deflected from their\r\nstraight path to the sea by coastwise deposits, and idly trail along for\r\nmiles just inside the outer beach; or they are split up into numerous\r\noffshoots among the silt beds of a delta, to find their way by shallow,\r\ntortuous channels to the ocean, so that they abate their value as\r\nhighways between sea and land. The silted mouths of the Nile excluded\r\nthe larger vessels even of Augustus Cæsar's time and admitted only their\r\nlighters,[449] just as to-day the lower Rufigi River loses much of its\r\nvalue to German East Africa because of its scant hospitality to vessels\r\ncoming from the sea.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Embayed coasts.]\r\n\r\nThe effect of subsidence, even on a low coastal plain, is to increase\r\naccessibility from the sea by flooding the previous river valleys and\r\ntransforming them into a succession of long shallow inlets, alternating\r\nwith low or hilly tongues of land. Such embayed coasts form our Atlantic\r\nseaboard from Delaware Bay, through Chesapeake Bay to Pamlico Sound, the\r\nNorth Sea face of England, the funnel-shaped \"förden\" or firths on the\r\neastern side of Jutland and Schleswig-Holstein, and the ragged sounds or\r\n\"Bodden\" that indent the Baltic shore of Germany from the Bay of Lubeck\r\nto the mouth of the Oder River.[450] Although the shallowness of the\r\nbordering sea and the sand-bars and sand reefs which characterize all\r\nflat coasts here also exclude the largest vessels, such coasts have\r\nnevertheless ample contact with both land and sea. They tend to develop,\r\ntherefore, the activities appropriate to both. A fertile soil and\r\nabundant local resources, as in tidewater Maryland and Virginia, make\r\nthe land more attractive than the sea; the inhabitants become farmers\r\nrather than sailors. On the other hand, an embayed coastland promising\r\nlittle return to the labor of tillage, but with abundant fisheries and a\r\nsuperior location for maritime trade, is sure to profit by the\r\naccessible sea, and achieve the predominant maritime activity which\r\ncharacterized the mediæval Hanse Towns of northern Germany and colonial\r\nNew England.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Maritime activity on steep embayed coasts.]\r\n\r\nSubsidence that brings the beat of the surf against the bolder reliefs\r\nof the land produces a ragged, indented coast, deep-water inlets\r\npenetrating far into the country, hilly or mountainous tongues of land\r\nrunning far out into the sea and breaking up into a swarm of islands and\r\nrocks, whose outer limits indicate approximately the old prediluvial\r\nline of shore.[451] Such are the fiord regions of Norway, southern\r\nAlaska, British Columbia, Greenland, and southern Chile; the Rias or\r\nsubmerged river valley coast of northwestern Spain; and the deeply\r\nsunken mountain flank of Dalmatia, whose every lateral valley has become\r\na bay or a strait between mainland and island. All these coasts are\r\ncharacterized by a close succession of inlets, a limited amount of level\r\ncountry for settlement or cultivation, and in their rear a steep slope\r\nimpeding communication with their hinterland. Inaccessibility from the\r\nland, a high degree of accessibility from the sea, and a paucity of\r\nlocal resources unite to thrust the inhabitants of such coasts out upon\r\nthe deep, to make of them fishermen, seamen, and ocean carriers. The\r\nsame result follows where no barrier on the land side exists, but where\r\na granitic or glaciated soil in the interior discourages agriculture and\r\nlandward expansion, as in Brittany, Maine, and Newfoundland. In all\r\nthese the land repels and the sea attracts. Brittany furnishes one-fifth\r\nof all the sailors in France's merchant marine,[452] and its pelagic\r\nfishermen sweep the seas from Newfoundland to Iceland. Three-fifths of\r\nthe maritime activity of the whole Austrian Empire is confined to the\r\nragged coast of Dalmatia, which furnishes to-day most of the sailors for\r\nthe imperial marine, just as in Roman days it manned the Adriatic fleet\r\nof the Cæsars.[453] The Haida, Tsimshean, and Tlingit Indians of the\r\nragged western coast of British Columbia and southern Alaska spread\r\ntheir villages on the narrow tide-swept hem of the land, and subsist\r\nchiefly by the generosity of the deep. They are poor landsmen, but\r\nexcellent boat-makers and seamen, venturing sometimes twenty-five miles\r\nout to sea to gather birds' eggs from the outermost fringe of rocks.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Contrasted coastal belts.]\r\n\r\nAs areas of elevation or subsidence are, as a rule, extensive, it\r\nfollows that coasts usually present long stretches of smooth simple\r\nshoreline, or a long succession of alternating inlet and headland.\r\nTherefore different littoral belts show marked contrasts in their degree\r\nof accessibility to the sea, and their harbors appear in extensive\r\ngroups of one type--fiords, river estuaries, sand or coral reef lagoons,\r\nand embayed mountain roots. A sudden change in relief or in geologic\r\nhistory sees one of these types immediately succeeded by a long-drawn\r\ngroup of a different type. Such a contrast is found between the Baltic\r\nand North Sea ports of Denmark and Germany, the eastern and southern\r\nseaboards of England, the eastern and western sides of Scotland, and the\r\nPacific littoral of North America north and south of Juan de Fuca\r\nStrait, attended by a contrasted history.\r\n\r\nA common morphological history, marked by mountain uplift, glaciation,\r\nand subsidence, has given an historical development similar in not a few\r\nrespects to the fiord coasts of New England, Norway, Iceland, Greenland,\r\nthe Alaskan \"panhandle,\" and southern Chile. Large subsidence areas on\r\nthe Mediterranean coasts from the Strait of Gibraltar to the Bosporus\r\nhave in essential features duplicated each other's histories, just as\r\nthe low infertile shores of the Baltic from Finland to the Skager Rack\r\nhave had much in common in their past development.\r\n\r\nWhere, however, a purely local subsidence, as in Kamerun Bay and Old\r\nCalabar on the elsewhere low monotonous stretch of the Upper Guinea\r\ncoast,[454] or a single great river estuary, as in the La Plata and the\r\nColumbia, affords a protected anchorage on an otherwise portless shore,\r\nsuch inlets assume increased importance. In the long unbroken reach of\r\nour Pacific seaboard, San Francisco Bay and the Columbia estuary are of\r\ninestimable value; while, by the treaty of 1848 with Mexico, the\r\ninternational boundary line was made to bend slightly south of west from\r\nthe mouth of the Gila River to the coast, in order to include in the\r\nUnited States territory the excellent harbor of San Diego. The mere\r\nnicks in the rim of Southwest Africa constituting Walfish Bay and Angra\r\nPequena assume considerable value as trading stations and places of\r\nrefuge along that 1,200-mile reach of inhospitable coast extending from\r\nCape Town north to Great Fish Bay.[455] It is worthy of notice in passing\r\nthat, though both of these small inlets lie within the territory of\r\nGerman Southwest Africa, Walfish Bay with 20 miles of coast on either\r\nside is a British possession, and that two tiny islets which commands\r\nthe entrance to the harbor of Angra Pequena, also belong to Great\r\nBritain. On the uniform coast of East Africa, the single considerable\r\nindentation formed by Delagoa Bay assumes immense importance, which,\r\nhowever, is due in part to the mineral wealth of its Transvaal\r\nhinterland. From this point northward for 35 degrees of latitude, a\r\nriver mouth, like that fixing the site of Beira, or an inshore islet\r\naffording protected harborage, like that of Mombasa, serves as the\r\nsingle ocean gateway of a vast territory, and forms the terminus of a\r\nrailroad--proof of its importance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Evolution of ports.]\r\n\r\nThe maritime evolution of all amply embayed coasts, except in Arctic and\r\nsub-Arctic regions inimical to all historical development, shows in its\r\nhighest stage the gradual elimination of minor ports, and the\r\nconcentration of maritime activity in a few favored ones, which have the\r\ndeepest and most capacious harbors and the best river, canal, or\r\nrailroad connection with the interior. The earlier stages are marked by\r\na multiplicity of ports, showing in general activity nearly similar in\r\namount and in kind. England's merchant marine in the fourteenth century\r\nwas distributed in a large group of small but important ports on the\r\nsouthern coast, all which, owing to their favorable location, were\r\nengaged in the French and Flemish trade; and in another group on the\r\neast coast, reaching from Hull to Colchester, which participated in the\r\nFlemish, Norwegian, and Baltic trade.[456] Most of these have now\r\ndeclined before the overpowering competition of a few such seaboard\r\nmarts as London, Hull, and Southampton. The introduction of steam\r\ntrawlers into the fishing fleets has in like manner led to the\r\nconcentration of the fishermen in a few large ports with good railroad\r\nfacilities, such as Aberdeen and Grimsby, while the fishing villages\r\nthat fringed the whole eastern and southern coasts have been gradually\r\ndepopulated.[457] So in colonial days, when New England was little more\r\nthan a cordon of settlements along that rock-bound littoral, almost\r\nevery inlet had its port actively engaged in coastwise and foreign\r\ncommerce in the West Indies and the Guinea Coast, in cod and mackerel\r\nfisheries, in whaling and shipbuilding, and this with only slight local\r\nvariations. This widespread homogeneity of maritime activity has been\r\nsucceeded by strict localization and differentiation, and reduction from\r\nmany to few ports. So, for the whole Atlantic seaboard of the United\r\nStates, evolution of seaports has been marked by increase of size\r\nattended by decrease of numbers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Offshore islands.]\r\n\r\nA well dissected coast, giving ample contact with the sea, often fails\r\nnevertheless to achieve historical importance, unless outlying islands\r\nare present to ease the transition from inshore to pelagic navigation,\r\nand to tempt to wider maritime enterprise. The long sweep of the\r\nEuropean coast from northern Norway to Brittany has played out a\r\nsignificant part of its history in that procession of islands formed by\r\nIceland, the Faroes, Shetland, Orkneys, Great Britain, Ireland and the\r\nChannel Isles, whether it was the navigator of ancient Armorica steering\r\nhis leather-sailed boat to the shores of Cæsar's Britain, or the modern\r\nBreton fisherman pulling in his nets off the coasts of distant Iceland.\r\nThe dim outline of mountainous Cyprus, seen against a far-away horizon\r\nfrom the slopes of Lebanon, beckoned the Phoenician ship-master thither\r\nto trade and to colonize, just as the early Etruscan merchants passed\r\nfrom their busy ironworks on the island of Elba over the narrow strait\r\nto visible Corsica.[458] It was on the eastern side of Greece, with its\r\ndeep embayments, its valleys opening out to the Aegean, with its 483\r\nislands scattered thickly as stars in the sky, and its Milky Way of the\r\nCyclades leading to the deep, rich soils of the Asia Minor coast, with\r\nits sea-made contact with all the stimulating influences and dangers\r\nemanating from the Asiatic littoral, that Hellenic history played its\r\nimpressive drama. Here was developed the spirit of enterprise that\r\ncarried colonies to far western Sicily and Italy, while the western or\r\nrear side had a confined succession of local events, scarce worthy the\r\nname of history. Neither mountain-walled Epirus nor Corcyra had an\r\nHellenic settlement in 735 B.C., at a date when the eastern Greeks had\r\nreached the Ionian coast of the Aegean and had set up a lonely group of\r\ncolonies even on the Bay of Naples. Turning to America, we find that the\r\nAntilles received their population from the only two tribes, first the\r\nArawaks and later the Caribs, who ever reached the indented northern\r\ncoast of South America between the Isthmus of Panama and the mouth of\r\nthe Orinoco. Here the small islands of the Venezuelan coast, often in\r\nsight, lured these peoples of river and shore to open-sea navigation,\r\nand drew them first to the Windward Isles, then northward step by step\r\nor island by island, to Hayti and Cuba.[459]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Offshore islands as vestibules of the mainland.]\r\n\r\nIn all these instances, offshore islands tempt to expansion and thereby\r\nadd to the historical importance of the nearby coast. Frequently,\r\nhowever, they achieve the same result by offering advantageous footholds\r\nto enterprising voyagers from remote lands, and become the medium for\r\ninfusing life into hitherto dead coasts. The long monotonous littoral of\r\nEast Africa from Cape Guadafui to the Cape of Good Hope, before the\r\nplanting here of Portuguese way-stations on the road to India in the\r\nsixteenth century, was destitute of historical significance, except that\r\nstretch opposite the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba, which Arab merchants\r\nin the tenth century appropriated as the basis for their slave and ivory\r\ntrade. The East Indies and Ceylon have been so many offshore stations\r\nwhence, first through the Portuguese, and later through the Dutch and\r\nEnglish, European influences percolated into southeastern Asia. Asia,\r\nwith its island-strewn shores, has diffused its influences over a broad\r\nzone of the western Pacific, and through the agency of its active\r\nrestless Malays, even halfway across that ocean. In contrast, the\r\nwestern coast of the Americas, a stretch nearly 10,000 miles from Tierra\r\ndel Fuego to the Aleutian chain, has seen its aboriginal inhabitants\r\nbarred from seaward expansion by the lack of offshore islands, and its\r\nentrance upon the historical stage delayed till recent times.\r\n\r\nIn general it can be said that islandless seas attain a later historical\r\ndevelopment than those whose expanse is rendered less forbidding by\r\nhospitable fragments of land. This factor, as well as its location\r\nremote from the old and stimulating civilization of Syria and Asia\r\nMinor, operated to retard the development of the western Mediterranean\r\nlong after the eastern basin had reached its zenith.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Previous habitat of coast-dwellers.]\r\n\r\nCoast-dwelling peoples exhibit every degree of intimacy with the water,\r\nfrom the amphibian life of many Malay tribes who love the wash of the\r\nwaves beneath their pile-built villages, to the Nama Bushmen who inhabit\r\nthe dune-walled coast of Southwest Africa, and know nothing of the sea.\r\nIn the resulting nautical development the natural talents and habits of\r\nthe people are of immense influence; but these in turn have been largely\r\ndetermined by the geographical environment of their previous habitat,\r\nwhether inland or coastal, and by the duration in time, as well as the\r\ndegree and necessity, of their contact with the sea. The Phoenicians,\r\nwho, according to their traditions as variously interpreted, came to the\r\ncoast of Lebanon either from the Persian Gulf or the Red Sea,[460]\r\nbrought to their favorable maritime location a different endowment from\r\nthat of the land-trading Philistines, who moved up from the south to\r\noccupy the sand-choked shores of Palestine,[461] or from that of the\r\nJews, bred to the grasslands of Mesopotamia and the gardens of Judea,\r\nwho only at rare periods in their history forced their way to the\r\nsea.[462] The unindented coast stretching from Cape Carmel south to the\r\nNile delta never produced a maritime people and never achieved maritime\r\nimportance, till a race of experienced mariners like the Greeks planted\r\ntheir colonies and built their harbor moles on the shores of Sharon and\r\nPhilistia.[463] So on the west face of Africa, from the Senegal southward\r\nalong the whole Guinea Coast to Benguela, all evidences of kinship and\r\ntradition among the local tribes point to an origin on the interior\r\nplains and a recent migration seaward,[464] so that no previous schooling\r\nenabled them to exploit the numerous harbors along this littoral, as did\r\nlater the sea-bred Portuguese and English.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Habitability of coasts as factor in maritime development.]\r\n\r\nNot only the accessibility of the coast from the sea, but also its\r\nhabitability enters as a factor into its historical importance. A sandy\r\ndesert coast, like that of Southwest Africa and much of the Peruvian\r\nlittoral, or a sterile mountain face, like that of Lower California,\r\nexcludes the people of the country from the sea. Saldanha Bay, the one\r\ngood natural harbor on the west coast of Cape Colony, is worthless even\r\nto the enterprising English, because it has no supply of fresh\r\nwater.[465] The slowness of the ancient Egyptians to take the short step\r\nforward from river to marine navigation can undoubtedly be traced to the\r\nfact that the sour swamps, barren sand-dunes, and pestilential marshes\r\non the seaward side of the Nile delta must have always been sparsely\r\npopulated as they are to-day,[466] and that a broad stretch of sandy waste\r\nformed their Red Sea littoral.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, where the hem of the continents is fertile enough to\r\nsupport a dense population, a large number of people are brought into\r\ncontact with the sea, even where no elaborate articulation lengthens the\r\nshoreline. When this teeming humanity of a garden littoral is barred\r\nfrom landward expansion by desert or mountain, or by the already\r\novercrowded population of its own hinterland, it wells over the brim of\r\nits home country, no matter how large, and overflows to other lands\r\nacross the seas. The congested population of the fertile and indented\r\ncoast of southern China, though not strictly speaking a sea-faring\r\npeople, found an outlet for their redundant humanity and their commerce\r\nin the tropical Sunda Islands. By the sixth century their trading junks\r\nwere doing an active business in the harbors of Java, Sumatra, and\r\nMalacca; they had even reached Ceylon and the Persian Gulf, and a little\r\nlater were visiting the great focal market of Aden at the entrance of\r\nthe Red Sea.[467] A strong infusion of Chinese blood improved the Malay\r\nstock in the Sunda Islands, and later in North Borneo and certain of the\r\nPhilippines, whither their traders and emigrants turned in the\r\nfourteenth century, when they found their opportunities curtailed in the\r\narchipelago to the south by the spread of Islam.[468] Now the \"yellow\r\nperil\" threatens the whole circle of these islands from Luzon to\r\nSumatra.\r\n\r\nSimilarly India, first from its eastern, later from its western coast,\r\nsent a stream of traders, Buddhist priests, and colonists to the Sunda\r\nIslands, and especially to Java, as early as the fifth century of our\r\nera, whence Indian civilization, religion, and elements of the Sanskrit\r\ntongue spread to Borneo, Sumatra, Bali, Lombok, and even to some\r\nsmaller islands among the Molucca group.[469] The Hindus became the\r\ndominant commercial nation of the Indian Ocean long before the great\r\ndevelopment of Arabian sea power, and later shared the trade of the East\r\nAfrican coast with the merchants of Oman and Yemen.[470] To-day they form\r\na considerable mercantile class in the ports of Mascat, Aden, Zanzibar,\r\nPemba, and Natal.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Geographic conditions for brilliant maritime development.]\r\n\r\nOn the coasts of large fertile areas like China and India, however,\r\nmaritime activity comes not as an early, but as an eventual development,\r\nassumes not a dominant, but an incidental historical importance. The\r\ncoastlands appearing early on the maritime stage of history, and playing\r\na brilliant part in the drama of the sea, have been habitable, but their\r\ntillable fields have been limited either in fertility, as in New\r\nEngland, or in amount, as in Greece, or in both respects, as in Norway.\r\nBut if blessed with advantageous location for international trade and\r\nmany or even a few fairly good harbors, such coasts tend to develop wide\r\nmaritime dominion and colonial expansion.[471]\r\n\r\nGreat fertility in a narrow coastal belt barred from the interior serves\r\nto concentrate and energize the maritime activities of the nation. The\r\n20-mile wide plain stretching along the foot of the Lebanon range from\r\nAntioch to Cape Carmel is even now the garden of Syria.[472] In ancient\r\nPhoenician days its abundant crops and vines supported luxuriant cities\r\nand a teeming population, which sailed and traded and colonized to the\r\nAtlantic outskirts of Europe and Africa. Moreover, their maritime\r\nventures had a wide sweep as early as 1100 B. C. Quite similar to the\r\nPhoenician littoral and almost duplicating its history, is the Oman\r\nseaboard of eastern Arabia. Here again a fertile coastal plain sprinkled\r\nwith its \"hundred villages,\" edged with a few tolerable harbors, and\r\nbacked by a high mountain wall with an expanse of desert beyond,\r\nproduced a race of bold and skilful navigators,[473] who in the Middle\r\nAges used their location between the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea to\r\nmake themselves the dominant maritime power of the Indian ocean. With\r\nthem maritime expansion was typically wide in its sweep and rapid in its\r\ndevelopment. Even before Mohammed's time they had reached India; but\r\nunder the energizing influences of Islam, by 758 they had established a\r\nflourishing trade with China, for which they set up way stations or\r\nstaple-points in Canton and the Sunda Islands.[474] First as voyagers and\r\nmerchants, then as colonists, they came, bringing their wares and their\r\nreligion to these distant shores. Marco Polo, visiting Sumatra in 1260,\r\ntells us the coast population was \"Saracen,\" but this was probably more\r\nin religion than in blood.[475] Oman ventures, seconded by those of\r\nYemen, reached as far south as east. The trading stations of Madisha and\r\nBarawa were established on the Somali coast of East Africa in 908, and\r\nKilwa 750 miles further south in 925. In the seventeenth century the\r\nOman Arabs dislodged the intruding Portuguese from all this coast belt\r\ndown to the present northern boundary of Portuguese East Africa. Even so\r\nlate as 1850 their capital, Mascat, sent out fine merchantmen that did\r\nan extensive carrying trade, and might be seen loading in the ports of\r\nBritish India, in Singapore, Java, and Mauritius.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Soil of coastlands as factor.]\r\n\r\nBrittany's active part in the maritime history of France is due not only\r\nto its ragged contour, its inshore and offshore islands, its forward\r\nlocation on the Atlantic which brought it near to the fisheries of\r\nNewfoundland and the trade of the West Indies, but also to the fact that\r\nthe \"Golden Belt,\" which, with but few interruptions, forms a band of\r\nfertility along the coast, has supported a denser population than the\r\nsterile granitic soils of the interior,[476] while the sea near by varied\r\nand enriched the diet of the inhabitants by its abundance of fish, and\r\nin its limy seaweed yielded a valuable fertilizer for their gardens.[477]\r\nThe small but countless alluvial deposits at the fiord heads in Norway,\r\naided by the products of the sea, are able to support a considerable\r\nnumber of people. Hence the narrow coastal rim of that country shows\r\nalways a density of population double or quadruple that of the next\r\ndensity belt toward the mountainous interior, and contains seventeen out\r\nof Norway's nineteen towns having more than 5,000 inhabitants.[478] It is\r\nthis relative fertility of the coastal regions, as opposed to the\r\nsterile interior, that has brought so large a part of Norway's people\r\nin contact with the Atlantic and helped give them a prominent place in\r\nmaritime history.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Barren coast of fertile hinterland.]\r\n\r\nOccasionally an infertile and sparsely inhabited littoral bordering a\r\nlimited zone of singular productivity, especially if favorably located\r\nfor international trade, will develop marked maritime activity, both in\r\ntrade and commercial colonization. Such was Arabian Yemen, the home of\r\nthe ancient Sabæans on the Red Sea, stretching from the Straits of\r\nBab-el-Mandeb north-westward for 500 miles. Here a mountain range,\r\nrising to 10,000 feet and bordering the plateau desert of central\r\nArabia, condenses the vapors of the summer monsoon and creates a\r\nlong-drawn oasis, where terraced coffee gardens and orchards blossom in\r\nthe irrigated soil; but the arid coastal strip at its feet, harboring a\r\nsparse population only along its tricking streams, developed a series of\r\nconsiderable ports as outlets for the abundant products and crowded\r\npopulation of the highlands.[479] A location on the busy sea lane leading\r\nfrom the Indian Ocean to the Mediterranean, near the meeting place of\r\nthree continents, made the merchants of the Yemen coast, like the Oman\r\nArabs to the north, middlemen in the trade of Europe with eastern Africa\r\nand India.[480] Therefore, even in the second century these Sabæans had\r\ntheir trading stations scattered along the east coast of Africa as far\r\nsouth as Zanzibar.[481] In 1502 Vasco da Gama found Arabs, either of\r\nOman or Yemen, yet farther south in Sofala, the port for the ivory and\r\ngold trade. Some of them he employed as pilots to steer his course to\r\nIndia.[482]\r\n\r\nHistory makes one fact very plain: a people who dwell by the sea, and\r\nto whom nature applies some lash to drive them out upon the deep,\r\ncommand opportunity for practically unlimited expansion. In this way\r\nsmall and apparently ill-favored strips of the earth's surface have\r\nbecome the seats of wide maritime supremacy and colonial empire. The\r\nscattered but extensive seaboard possession of little Venice and Genoa\r\nin the latter centuries of the Middle Ages are paralleled in modern\r\ntimes by the large oversea dominions of the English and Dutch.\r\n\r\nSeaward expansions of peoples are always of great moment and generally\r\nof vast extent, whether they are the coastward movements of inland\r\npeoples to get a foothold upon the great oceanic highway of trade and\r\ncivilization, as has been the case with the Russians notably since the\r\nearly eighteenth century, and with numerous interior tribes of West\r\nAfrica since the opening of the slave trade; or whether they represent\r\nthe more rapid and extensive coastwise and oversea expansions of\r\nmaritime nations like the English, Dutch, and Portuguese. In either\r\nevent they give rise to widespread displacements of peoples and a\r\nbizarre arrangement of race elements along the coast. When these two\r\ncontrary movements meet, the shock of battle follows, as the recent\r\nhistory of the Russians and Japanese in Manchuria and Korea illustrates,\r\nthe wars of Swedes and Russians for the possession of the eastern Baltic\r\nlittoral, and the numerous minor conflicts that have occurred in Upper\r\nGuinea between European commercial powers and the would-be trading\r\ntribes of the bordering hinterland.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ethnic contrast between coast and interior peoples.]\r\n\r\nA coast region is a peculiar habitat, inasmuch as it is more or less\r\ndominated by the sea. It is exposed to inundation by tidal wave and to\r\noccupation by immigrant fleets. It may be the base for out-going\r\nmaritime enterprise or the goal of some oversea movement, the dispenser\r\nor the recipient of colonists. The contrast between coast-dwellers and\r\nthe nearby inland people which exists so widely can be traced not only\r\nto a difference of environment, but often to a fundamental difference of\r\nrace or tribe caused by immigration to accessible shores. The Greeks,\r\ncrowded in their narrow peninsula of limited fertility, wove an Hellenic\r\nborder on the skirts of the Black Sea and eastern Mediterranean lands,\r\njust as the Carthaginians added a fringe of aliens to North Africa,\r\nwhere the Punic people of the coast presented a marked contrast to the\r\nBerbers of the interior. [See map page 251.]\r\n\r\nAn ethnographical map of Russia to-day shows a narrow but almost\r\ncontinuous rim of Germans stretching from the River Niemen north through\r\nthe Baltic coast of Courland, Livland, and Esthland, as far as Revel;\r\nand again, a similar band of Swedes along the seaboard of Finland, from\r\na point east of Helsingfors on the south around to Uleaborg on the\r\nnorth,[483] dating from the time when Finland was a political dependency\r\nof Sweden, and influenced by the fact that the frozen Gulf of Bothnia\r\nevery winter makes a bridge of ice between the two shores. [See map page\r\n225.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ethnic contrasts in the Pacific islands.]\r\n\r\nEverywhere in the Melanesian archipelago, where Papuans and Malays dwell\r\nside by side, the latter as the new-comers are always found in\r\npossession of the coast, while the darker aborigines have withdrawn into\r\nthe interior. So in the Philippines, the aboriginal Negritos, pure or\r\nmore often mixed with Malayan blood, as in the Mangyan tribe of central\r\nMindoro, are found crowded back into the interior by the successive\r\ninvasions of Malays who have encircled the coasts. [See map page 147.]\r\nThe Zamboanga peninsula of Mindanao has an inland pagan population of\r\nprimitive Malayan race called Subanon, who have been displaced from the\r\nlittoral by the seafaring Samal Moros, Mohammedanized Malays from the\r\neast shores of Sumatra and the adjacent islands, who spread northward\r\nabout 1300 under the energizing impulse of their new religion.[484] Even\r\nat so late a date as the arrival of Magellan, the Subanon seem to have\r\nstill occupied some points of the coast,[485] just as the savage Ainos of\r\nthe Island of Yezo touched the sea about Sapporo only forty years ago,\r\nthough they are now surrounded by a seaboard rim of Japanese.[486]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ethnic contrasts in the Americas.]\r\n\r\nIf we turn to South America, we find that warlike Tupi, at the time of\r\nthe discovery, occupied the whole Brazilian coast from the southern\r\ntropic north to eastern Guiana, while the highlands of eastern Brazil\r\nimmediately in their rear were populated by tribes of Ges, who had been\r\ndisplaced by the coastwise expansion of the Tupi canoemen.[487] [See map\r\npage 101.] And to-day this same belt of coastland has been appropriated\r\nby a foreign population of Europeans and Negroes, while the vast\r\ninterior of Brazil shows a predominance of native Indian stocks, only\r\nbroken here and there by a lonely _enclave_ of Portuguese settlement.\r\nThe early English and French territories in America presented this same\r\ncontrast of coast and inland people--the colonists planting themselves\r\non the hem of the continent to preserve maritime connection with the\r\nhome countries, the aborigines forced back beyond reach of the tide.\r\n\r\nWherever an energetic seafaring people with marked commercial or\r\ncolonizing bent make a highway of the deep, they give rise to this\r\ndistinction of coast and inland people on whatever shores they touch.\r\nThe expanding Angles and Saxons did it in the North Sea and the Channel,\r\nwhere they stretched their _litus Saxonicum_ faintly along the coast of\r\nthe continent to the apex of Brittany, and firmly along the hem of\r\nEngland from Southampton Water to the Firth of Forth;[488] the sea-bred\r\nScandinavians did it farther north in the Teutonic fringe of settlements\r\nwhich they placed on the shores of Celtic Scotland and Ireland.[489]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Older ethnic stock in coastlands.]\r\n\r\nAs a rule it is the new-comers who hold the coast, but occasionally the\r\ncoast-dwellers represent the older ethnic stock. In the Balkan Peninsula\r\nto-day the descendants of the ancient Hellenes are, with few exceptions,\r\nconfined to the coast. The reason is to be found in the fact that the\r\nSlavs and other northern races who have intruded by successive invasions\r\nfrom the plains of southern Russia are primarily inland peoples, and\r\ntherefore have occupied the core of the peninsula, forcing the original\r\nGreek population before them to the edge of the sea.[490] This is the\r\nsame anthropo-geographical process which makes so many peninsulas the\r\nlast halting-place of a dislodged earlier race. But the Greeks who line\r\nthe northern and western shores of Asiatic Turkey are such only in\r\nlanguage and religion, because their prevailing broad head-form shows\r\nthem to be Turks and Armenians in race stock.[491]\r\n\r\nSometimes the distinction of race between coast and interior is\r\nobliterated so far as language and civilization are concerned, but\r\nsurvives less conspicuously in head-form and pigmentation. The outermost\r\nfringe of the Norwegian coast, from the extreme south to the latitude of\r\nTrondhjem in the north, is occupied by a broad-headed, round-faced,\r\nrather dark people of only medium height, who show decided affinities\r\nwith the Alpine race of Central Europe, and who present a marked\r\ncontrast to the tall narrow-headed blondes of pure Teutonic type,\r\nconstituting the prevailing population from the inner edge of the coast\r\neastward into Sweden. This brachycephalic, un-Germanic stock of the\r\nNorwegian seaboard seems to represent the last stand made by that once\r\nwide-spread Alpine race, which here has been shoved along to the rocky\r\ncapes and islands of the outer edge by a later Teutonic immigration\r\ncoming from Sweden.[492] So the largest continuous area of Negrito stock\r\nin the Philippines is found in the Sierra Madre mountains defining the\r\neastern coast of northern Luzon.[493] Facing the neighborless wastes of\r\nthe Pacific, whence no new settler could come, turned away from the\r\nsources of Malay immigration to the southwest, its location made it a\r\nretreat, rather than a gateway to incoming races. [See map page 147.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ethnic amalgamations in coastlands.]\r\n\r\nWhere an immigrant population from oversea lands occupies the coastal\r\nhem of a country, rarely do they preserve the purity of their race.\r\nComing at first with marauding or trading intent, they bring no women\r\nwith them, but institute their trading stations or colonies by marriage\r\nwith the women of the country. The ethnic character of the resultant\r\npopulation depends upon the proportion of the two constituent elements,\r\nthe nearness or remoteness of their previous kinship, and the degree of\r\ninnate race antagonism. The ancient Greek elements which crossed the\r\nAegean from different sections of the peninsula to colonize the Ionian\r\ncoast of Asia Minor mingled with the native Carian, Cretan, Lydian,\r\nPelasgian, and Phoenician populations which they found there.[494] On all\r\nthe barbarian shores where the Greeks established themselves, there\r\narose a mixed race--in Celtic Massilia, in Libyan Barca, and in Scythian\r\nCrimea--but always a race Hellenized, born interpreters and mercantile\r\nagents.[495]\r\n\r\nA maritime people, engrossed chiefly with the idea of trade, moves in\r\nsmall groups and intermittently; hence it modifies the original coastal\r\npopulation less than does a genuine colonizing nation, especially as it\r\nprefers the smallest possible territorial base for its operations. The\r\nArab element in the coast population of East Africa is strongly\r\nrepresented, but not so strongly as one might expect after a thousand\r\nyears of intercourse, because it was scattered in detached seaboard\r\npoints, only a few of which were really stable. The native population of\r\nZanzibar and Pemba and the fringe of coast tribes on the mainland\r\nopposite are clearly tinged with Arab blood. These Swahili, as they are\r\ncalled, are a highly mixed race, as their negro element has been derived\r\nnot only from the local coast peoples, but also from the slaves who for\r\ncenturies have been halting here on their seaward journey from the\r\ninterior of Africa.[496] [See map page 105.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Multiplicity of race elements on coasts.]\r\n\r\nCoast peoples tend to show something more than the hybridism resulting\r\nfrom the mingling of two stocks. So soon as the art of navigation\r\ndeveloped beyond its initial phase of mere coastwise travel, and began\r\nto strike out across the deep, all coast peoples bordered upon each\r\nother, and the sea became a common waste boundary between. Unlike a land\r\nboundary, which is in general accessible from only two sides and tends\r\nto show, therefore, only two constituent elements in its border\r\npopulation, a sea boundary is accessible from many directions with\r\nalmost equal ease; it therefore draws from many lands, and gives its\r\npopulation a variety of ethnic elements and a cosmopolitan stamp. This,\r\nhowever, is most marked in great seaports, but from them it penetrates\r\ninto the surrounding country. The whole southern and eastern coast\r\npopulation of England, from Cornwall to the Wash, received during\r\nElizabeth's reign valuable accessions of industrious Flemings and\r\nHuguenots, refugees from Catholic persecution in the Netherlands and\r\nFrance.[497] Our North Atlantic States, whose population is more than\r\nhalf (50.9 per cent.) made up of aliens and natives born of foreign\r\nparents,[498] have drawn these elements from almost the whole circle of\r\nAtlantic shores, from Norway to Argentine and from Argentine to\r\nNewfoundland. Even the Southern States, so long unattractive to\r\nimmigrants on account of the low status of labor, show a fringe of\r\nvarious foreign elements along the Gulf coast, the deeper tint of which\r\non the census maps fades off rapidly toward the interior. The same\r\nphenomenon appears with Asiatic and Australian elements in our Pacific\r\nseaboard states.[499] The cosmopolitan population of New York, with its\r\n\"Chinatown,\" its \"Little Italy,\" its Russian and Hungarian quarters, has\r\nits counterpart in the mixed population of Mascat, peopled by Hindu,\r\nArabs, Persians, Kurds, Afghans, and Baluchis, settled here for purposes\r\nof trade; or in the equally mongrel inhabitants of Aden and Zanzibar, of\r\nMarseilles, Constantinople, Alexandria, Port Said, and other\r\nMediterranean ports.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lingua franca of coasts.]\r\n\r\nThe cosmopolitanism and the commercial activity that characterize so\r\nmany seaboards are reflected in the fact that, with rare exceptions, it\r\nis the coast regions of the world that give rise to a _lingua franca_ or\r\n_lingua geral_. The original _lingua franca_ arose on the coast of the\r\nLevant during the period of Italian commercial supremacy there. It\r\nconsisted of an Italian stock, on which were grafted Greek, Arabic, and\r\nTurkish words, and was the regular language of trade for French,\r\nSpanish, and Italians.[500] It is still spoken in many Mediterranean\r\nports, especially in Smyrna, and in the early part of the nineteenth\r\ncentury was in use from Madagascar to the Philippines.[501] From the\r\ncoastal strip of the Zanzibar Arabs, recently transferred to German East\r\nAfrica, the speech of the Swahili has become a means of communication\r\nover a great part of East Africa, from the coast to the Congo and the\r\nsources of the Nile. It is a Bantu dialect permeated with Arabic and\r\nHindu terms, and sparsely sprinkled even with English and German\r\nwords.[502] \"Pidgin English\" (business English) performs the function of\r\na _lingua franca_ in the ports of China and the Far East. It is a jargon\r\nof corrupted English with a slight mixture of Chinese, Malay, and\r\nPortuguese words, arranged according to the Chinese idiom. Another\r\nmongrel English does service on the coast of New Guinea. The \"Nigger\r\nEnglish\" of the West African trade is a regular dialect among the\r\nnatives of the Sierra Leone coast. Farther east, along the Upper Guinea\r\nlittoral, the Eboe family of tribes who extend across the Niger delta\r\nfrom Lagos to Old Calabar have furnished a language of trade in one of\r\ntheir dialects.[503] The Tupi speech of the Brazilian coast Indians, with\r\nwhom the explorers first came into contact, became, in the mouth of\r\nPortuguese traders and Jesuit missionaries, the _lingua geral_ or medium\r\nof communication between the whites and the various Indian tribes\r\nthroughout Brazil.[504] The Chinook Indians, located on our Pacific coast\r\nnorth and south of the Columbia River, have furnished a jargon of\r\nIndian, French, and English words which serves as a language of trade\r\nthroughout a long stretch of the northwest Pacific coast, not only\r\nbetween whites and Indians, but also between Indians of different\r\nlinguistic stocks.[505]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Coast-dwellers as middlemen.]\r\n\r\nThe coast is the natural habitat of the middleman. One strip of seaboard\r\nproduces a middleman people, and then sends them out to appropriate\r\nother littorals, if geographic conditions are favorable; otherwise it is\r\ncontent with the transit trade of its own locality. It breeds\r\nessentially a race of merchants, shunning varied production, nursing\r\nmonopoly by secrecy and every method to crush competition. The profits\r\nof trade attract all the free citizens, and the laboring class is small\r\nor slave. Expansion landward has no attraction in comparison with the\r\nseaward expansion of commerce. The result is often a relative dearth of\r\nlocal land-grown food stuffs. King Hiram of Tyre, in his letter to King\r\nSolomon, promised to send him trees of cedar and cypress, made into\r\nrafts and conveyed to the coast of Philistia, and asked in return for\r\ngrain, \"which we stand in need of because we inhabit an island.\" The pay\r\ncame in the form of wheat, oil, and wine. But Solomon furnished a\r\nconsiderable part of the laborers--30,000 of them--who were sent, 10,000\r\nat a time, to Mount Lebanon to cut the timber, apparently under the\r\ndirection of the more skilful Sidonian foresters.[506] A type of true\r\ncoast traders is found in the Duallas of the German Kamerun, at the\r\ninner angle of the Gulf of Guinea. Located along the lower course and\r\ndelta of the Mungo River where it flows into the Kamerun estuary, they\r\ncommand a good route through a mountainous country into the interior.\r\nThis they guard jealously, excluding all competition, monopolizing the\r\ntrade, and imposing a transit duty on all articles going to and from the\r\ninterior. They avoid agriculture so far as possible. Their women and\r\nslaves produce an inadequate supply of bananas and yams, but crops\r\nneeding much labor are wholly neglected, so that their coasts have a\r\nreputation for dearness of provisions.[507]\r\n\r\nAlong the 4,500 miles of West African coast between the Senegal and the\r\nKunene rivers the negro's natural talent for trade has developed special\r\ntribes, who act as intermediaries between the interior and the European\r\nstations on the seaboard. Among these we find the Bihenos and Banda of\r\nPortuguese Benguela, who fit out whole caravans for the back country;\r\nthe Portuguese of Loanda rely on the Ambaquistas and the Mbunda\r\nmiddlemen. The slave trade particularly brought a sinister and abnormal\r\nactivity to these seaboard tribes,[508] just as it did to the East Coast\r\ntribes, and stimulated both in the exploitation of their geographic\r\nposition as middlemen.[509]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Monopoly of trade with the hinterland.]\r\n\r\nThe Alaskan coast shows the same development. The Kinik Indians at the\r\nhead of Cook's Inlet buy skins of land animals from the inland\r\nAthapascans at the sources of the Copper River, and then make a good\r\nprofit by selling them to the American traders of the coast. These same\r\nAthapascans for a long time found a similar body of middlemen in the\r\nUgalentz at the mouth of the Copper River, till the Americans there\r\nencouraged the inland hunters to bring their skins to the fur station on\r\nthe coast.[510] The Chilcats at the head of Lynn Canal long monopolized\r\nthe fur trade with the Athapascan Indians about Chilkoot Pass; these\r\nthey would meet on the divide and buy their skins, which they would\r\ncarry to the Hudson Bay Company agents on the coast. They guarded their\r\nmonopoly jealously, and for fifty years were able to exclude all traders\r\nand miners from the passes leading to the Yukon.[511]\r\n\r\nThe same policy of monopoly and exclusion has been pursued by the Moro\r\ncoast dwellers of Mindanao in relation to the pagan tribes of the\r\ninterior. They buy at low prices the forest and agriculture products of\r\nthe inland Malays, whom they do not permit to approach either rivers or\r\nseaboard, for fear they may come into contact with the Chinese merchants\r\nalong the coast. So fiercely is their monopoly guarded by this middleman\r\nrace, that the American Government in the Philippines will be able to\r\nbreak it only by military interference.[512]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Differentiation of coast from inland people.]\r\n\r\nDifferences of occupation, of food supply, and of climate often further\r\noperate to differentiate the coast from the inland people near by, and\r\nto emphasize the ethnic difference which is almost invariably present,\r\neither inconspicuously from a slight infusion of alien blood, or\r\nplainly as in an immigrant race. Sometimes the contrast is in physique.\r\nIn Finisterre province of western Brittany, the people along the more\r\nfertile coastal strip are on the average an inch taller than the\r\ninhabitants of the barren, granitic interior. Their more generous food\r\nsupply, further enriched by the abundant fisheries at their doors, would\r\naccount for this increased stature; but this must also be attributed in\r\npart to intermixture of the local Celts with a tall Teutonic stock which\r\nbrushed along these shores, but did not penetrate into the unattractive\r\ninterior.[513] So the negroes of the Guinea Coast, though not immune\r\nfrom fevers, are better nourished on the alluvial lowlands near the\r\nabundant fish of the lagoons, and hence are often stronger and better\r\nlooking than the plateau interior tribes near by. But here, again, an\r\nadvantageous blending of races can not be excluded as a contributing\r\ncause.[514] Sometimes the advantage in physique falls to the inland\r\npeople, especially in tropical countries when a highland interior is\r\ncontrasted with a low coast belt. The wild Igorotes, inhabiting the\r\nmountainous interior of northern Luzon, enjoy a cooler climate than the\r\nlowlands, and this has resulted in developing in them a decidedly better\r\nphysique and more industrious habits than are found in the civilized\r\npeople of the coasts encircling them.[515]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Early civilization of coasts.]\r\n\r\nWhere a coast people is an immigrant stock from some remote oversea\r\npoint, it brings to its new home a surplus of energy which was perhaps\r\nthe basis of selection in the exodus from the mother country. Such a\r\npeople is therefore characterized by greater initiative, enterprise, and\r\nendurance than the sedentary population which it left behind or that to\r\nwhich it comes; and these qualities are often further stimulated by the\r\ntransfer to a new environment rich in opportunities. Sea-born in their\r\norigin, sea-borne in their migration, they cling to the zone of\r\nlittoral, because here they find the conditions which they best know how\r\nto exploit. Dwelling on the highway of the ocean, living in easy\r\nintercourse with distant countries, which would have been far more\r\ndifficult of access by land-travel over territories inhabited by hostile\r\nraces, exchanging with these both commodities and ideas, food-stuffs and\r\nreligions, they become the children of civilization, and their\r\nsun-burned seamen the sturdy apostles of progress. Therefore it may be\r\nlaid down as a general proposition, that the coasts of a country are\r\nthe first part of it to develop, not an indigenous or local\r\ncivilization, but a cosmopolitan culture, which later spreads inland\r\nfrom the seaboard.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Retarded coastal peoples.]\r\n\r\nExceptions to this rule are found in barren or inaccessible coasts like\r\nthe Pacific littoral of Peru and Mexico, and on shores like those of\r\nCalifornia, western Africa and eastern Luzon, which occupy an adverse\r\ngeographic location facing a neighborless expanse of ocean and remote\r\nfrom the world's earlier foci of civilization. Therefore the descent\r\nfrom the equatorial plateau of Africa down to the Atlantic littoral\r\nmeans a drop in culture also, because the various elements of\r\ncivilization which for ages have uninterruptedly filtered into Sudan\r\nfrom the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, have rarely penetrated to the\r\nwestern rim of the highland, and hence never reached the coast.\r\nMoreover, this steaming lowland, from the Senegal River to the Kamerun\r\nMountains, has been a last asylum for dislodged tribes who have been\r\ndriven out by expanding peoples of the plateau. They have descended in\r\ntheir flight upon the original coast dwellers, adding to the general\r\ncondition of political disruption, multiplying the number of small weak\r\ntribes, increasing the occasions for intertribal wars, and furthering\r\nthe prevailing degradation. The seaboard lowlands of Sierra Leone,\r\nLiberia and the Ivory Coast have all suffered thus In historic\r\ntimes.[516] All this region was the original home of the low, typical\r\n\"Guinea Nigger\" of the Southern plantation. The coasts of Oregon and\r\nCalifornia showed a parallel to this in their fragmentary native tribes\r\nof retarded development, whose level of culture, low at best, sank\r\nrapidly from the interior toward the seaboard. They seem to have been\r\nintruders from the central highlands, who further deteriorated in their\r\nweakness and isolation after reaching the coast. They bore every mark of\r\ndegradation in their short stature, linguistic and tribal dismemberment,\r\ntheir low morals and culture, which ranked them little above the brutes.\r\nIn contrast, all the large and superior Indian groups of North America\r\nbelonged to the interior of the continent.[517]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cultural contrast of coast and interior.]\r\n\r\nThe long, indented coast of the Mediterranean has in all ages up to\r\nmodern times presented the contrast of a littoral more advanced in\r\ncivilization than the inland districts. The only exception was ancient\r\nEgypt before Psammeticus began to exploit his mud-choked seaboard. This\r\ncontrast was apparent, not only wherever Phoenicians or Greeks had\r\nappropriated the remote coast of an alien and retarded people, but even\r\nin near-by Thrace the savage habits of the interior tribes were softened\r\nonly where these dwelt in close proximity to the Ionian colonies along\r\nthe coast, a fact as noticeable in the time of Tacitus as in that of\r\nHerodotus five hundred years before.[518] The ancient philosophers of\r\nGreece were awake to the deep-rooted differences between an inland and a\r\nmaritime city, especially in respect to receptivity of ideas, activity\r\nof intellect, and affinity for culture.[519]\r\n\r\nIf we turn to the Philippines, we find that 65 per cent. of the\r\nChristian or civilized population of the islands live on or near the\r\ncoast; and of the remaining 35 per cent. dwelling inland, by far the\r\ngreater part represents simply the landward extension of the area of\r\nChristian civilization which had Manila Bay for a nucleus.[520]\r\nOtherwise, all the interior districts are occupied by wild or pagan\r\ntribes. Mohammedanism, too, a religion of civilization, rims the\r\nsouthernmost islands which face the eastern distributing point of the\r\nfaith in Java; it is confined to the coasts, except for its one inland\r\narea of expansion along the lake and river system of the Rio Grande of\r\nMindanao, which afforded an inland extension of sea navigation for the\r\nsmall Moro boat. Even the Fiji Islands show different shades of savagery\r\nbetween coasts and interior.[521]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Progress from thalassic to oceanic coasts.]\r\n\r\nCoasts are areas of out-going and in-coming maritime influences. The\r\nnature and amount of these influences depend upon the sea or ocean whose\r\nrim the coast in question helps to form, and the relations of that coast\r\nto its other tide-washed shores. Our land-made point of view dominates\r\nus so completely, that we are prone to consider a coast as margin of its\r\nland, and not also as margin of its sea, whence, moreover, it receives\r\nthe most important contributions to its development. The geographic\r\nlocation of a coast as part of a thalassic or of an oceanic rim is a\r\nbasic factor in its history; more potent than local conditions of\r\nfertility, irregular contour, or accessibility from sea and hinterland.\r\nEverything that can be said about the different degrees of historical\r\nimportance attaching to inland seas and open oceans in successive ages\r\napplies equally to the countries and peoples along their shores; and\r\neverything that enhances or diminishes the cultural possibilities of a\r\nsea--its size, zonal location, its relation to the oceans and\r\ncontinents--finds its expression in the life along its coasts.\r\n\r\nThe anthropo-geographical evolution which has passed from small to large\r\nstates and from small to large seas as fields of maritime activity has\r\nbeen attended by a continuous change in the value of coasts, according\r\nas these were located on enclosed basins like the Mediterranean, Red,\r\nand Baltic; on marginal ones like the China and North seas; or on the\r\nopen ocean. In the earlier periods of the world's history, a location on\r\na relatively small enclosed sea gave a maritime horizon wide enough to\r\nlure, but not so wide as to intimidate; and by its seclusion led to a\r\nconcentration and intensification of historical development, which in\r\nmany of its phases left models for subsequent ages to wonder at and\r\nimitate. This formative period and formative environment outgrown,\r\nhistorical development was transferred to locations on the open oceans,\r\naccording to the law of human advance from small to large areas. The\r\nhistorical importance of the Mediterranean and the Baltic shores was\r\ntransitory, a prelude to the larger importance of the Atlantic littoral\r\nof Europe, just as this in turn was to attain its full significance only\r\nwhen the circumnavigation of Africa and South America linked the\r\nAtlantic to the World Ocean. Thus that gradual expansion of the\r\ngeographic horizon which has accompanied the progress of history has\r\nseen a slow evolution in the value of seaboard locations, the transfer\r\nof maritime leadership from small to large basins, from thalassic to\r\noceanic ports, from Lubeck to Hamburg, from Venice to Genoa, as earlier\r\nfrom the Piræus to Ostia, and later from England's little _Cinque Ports_\r\nto Liverpool and the Clyde.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Geographic location of coasts.]\r\n\r\nThough the articulations of a coast determine the ease with which\r\nmaritime influences are communicated to the land, nevertheless history\r\nshows repeated instances where an exceptional location, combined with\r\nrestricted area, has raised a poorly indented seaboard to maritime and\r\ncultural preeminence. Phoenicia's brilliant history rose superior to the\r\nlimitation of indifferent harbors, owing to a position on the Arabian\r\nisthmus between the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean at the meeting\r\nplace of Europe, Asia, and Africa. Moreover, the advantages of this\r\nparticular location have in various times and in various degrees brought\r\ninto prominence all parts of the Syrian and Egyptian coasts from Antioch\r\nto Alexandria. So the whole stretch of coast around the head of the\r\nAdriatic, marking the conjunction of a busy sea-route with various\r\nland-routes over the encircling mountains from Central Europe, has seen\r\nduring the ages a long succession of thriving maritime cities, in spite\r\nof fast-silting harbors and impeded connection with the hinterland. Here\r\nin turn have ruled with maritime sway Spina, Ravenna, Aquileia,[522]\r\nVenice, and Trieste. On the other side of the Italian peninsula, the\r\nlocation on the northernmost inlet of the western Mediterranean and at\r\nthe seaward base of the Ligurian Apennines, just where this range opens\r\ntwo passes of only 1,800 feet elevation to the upper Po Valley, made an\r\nactive maritime town of Genoa from Strabo's day to the present. In its\r\nincipiency it relied upon one mediocre harbor on an otherwise harborless\r\ncoast, a local supply of timber for its ships, and a road northward\r\nacross the mountains.[523] The maritime ascendency in the Middle Ages of\r\nGenoa, Pisa, Venice, and Barcelona proves that no long indented coast is\r\nnecessary, but only one tolerable harbor coupled with an advantageous\r\nlocation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Intermediate location between contrasted coasts.]\r\n\r\nOwing to the ease and cheapness of water transportation, a seaboard\r\nposition between two other coasts of contrasted products due to a\r\ndifference either of zonal location or of economic development or of\r\nboth combined, insures commercial exchanges and the inevitable\r\nactivities of the middleman. The position of Carthage near the center of\r\nthe Mediterranean enabled her to fatten on the trade between the highly\r\ndeveloped eastern basin and the retarded western one. Midway between the\r\nteeming industrial towns of medieval Flanders, Holland, and western\r\nGermany, and the new unexploited districts of retarded Russia, Poland,\r\nand Scandinavia, lay the long line of the German Hanseatic towns--Kiel,\r\nLubeck, Wiemar, Rostock, Stralsund, Greifswald, Anclam, Stettin, and\r\nColberg, the _civitates maritimæ_. For three centuries or more they made\r\nthemselves the dominant commercial and maritime power of the Baltic by\r\nexchanging Flemish fabrics, German hardware, and Spanish wines for the\r\nfurs and wax of Russian forests, tallow and hides from Polish pastures,\r\nand crude metals from Swedish mines.[524] So Portugal by its\r\ngeographical location became a staple place where the tropical products\r\nfrom the East Indies were transferred to the vessels of Dutch merchants,\r\nand by them distributed to northern Europe. Later New England, by a\r\nparallel location, became the middleman in the exchanges of the tropical\r\nproducts of the West Indies, the tobacco of Virginia, and the wheat of\r\nMaryland for the manufactured wares of England and the fish of\r\nNewfoundland.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Historical decline of certain coasts.]\r\n\r\nPrimitive or early maritime commerce has always been characterized by\r\nthe short beat, a succession of middlemen coasts, and a close series of\r\nstaple-places, such as served the early Indian Ocean trade in Oman,\r\nMalabar Coast, Ceylon, Coromandel Coast, Malacca, and Java. Therefore,\r\nmany a littoral admirably situated for middleman trade loses this\r\nadvantage so soon as commerce matures enough to extend the sweep of its\r\nvoyages, and to bring into direct contact the two nations for which that\r\ncoast was intermediary. This is only another aspect of the\r\nanthropo-geographic evolution from small to large areas. The decline of\r\nthe Mediterranean coasts followed close upon the discovery of the\r\nsea-route to India; nor was their local importance restored by the Suez\r\nCanal. Portugal declined when the Dutch, excluded from the Tagus mouth\r\non the union of Portugal with Spain, found their way to the Spice Isles.\r\nCeylon, though still the chief port of call in the Indian Ocean, has\r\nlost its preëminence as chief market for all the lands between Africa\r\nand China, which it enjoyed in the sixth century, owing to the \"long\r\nhaul\" of modern oceanic commerce.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Political factors in this decline.]\r\n\r\nNot only that far-reaching readjustment of maritime ascendency which in\r\nthe sixteenth century followed the advance from thalassic to oceanic\r\nfields of commerce, but also purely local political events may for a\r\ntime produce striking changes in the use or importance of coasts. The\r\nPiræus, which had been the heart of ancient Athens, almost wholly lost\r\nits value in the checkered political history of the country during the\r\nMiddle Ages, when naval power and merchant marine almost vanished; but\r\nwith the restoration of Grecian independence in 1832, much of its\r\npristine activity was restored. Up to the beginning of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, Japan had exploited her advantageous location and her richly\r\nindented coast to develop a maritime trade which extended from Kamchatka\r\nto India; but in 1624 an imperial order withdrew every Japanese vessel\r\nfrom the high seas, and for over two hundred years robbed her busy\r\nlittoral of all its historical significance. The real life of the\r\nPacific coast of the United States began only with its incorporation\r\ninto the territory of the Republic, but it failed to attain its full\r\nimportance until our acquisition of Alaska, Hawaii, and the Philippines.\r\nSo the coast of the Persian Gulf has had periods of activity alternating\r\nwith periods of deathlike quiet. Its conquest by the Saracens in the\r\nseventh century inaugurated an era of intense maritime enterprise along\r\nits drowsy shores. What new awakening may it experience, if it should\r\none day become a Russian littoral!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Physical causes of decline.]\r\n\r\nSometimes the decline in historical importance is due to physical\r\nmodifications in the coast itself, especially when, the mud transported\r\nby a great river to the sea is constantly pushing forward the outer\r\nshoreline. The control of the Adriatic passed in turn from Spina to\r\nAdria, Ravenna, Aquileia, Venice, and Trieste, owing to a steady silting\r\nup of the coast.[525] Strabo records that Spina, originally a port, was\r\nin his time 90 stadia, or 10 miles, from the sea.[526] Bruges, once the\r\ngreat _entrepôt_ of the Hanseatic League, was originally on an arm of\r\nthe sea, with which it was later connected by canal, and which has been\r\nsilted up since 1432, so that its commerce, disturbed too by local wars,\r\nwas transferred to Antwerp on the Scheldt.[527] Many early English\r\nports on the coast of Kent and on the old solid rim of the Fenland\r\nmarshes now lie miles inland from the Channel and the Wash.\r\n\r\nA people never utilizes all parts of its coast with equal intensity, or\r\nany part with equal intensity in all periods of its development; but,\r\naccording to the law of differentiation, it gradually concentrates its\r\nenergies in a few favored ports, whose maritime business tends to become\r\nspecialized. Then every extension of the subsidiary territory and\r\nintensification of production with advancing civilization increases the\r\nmass of men and wares passing through these ocean gateways. The shores\r\nof New York, Delaware, and Chesapeake bays are more important to the\r\ncountry now than they were in early colonial days, when their back\r\ncountry extended only to the watershed of the Appalachian system. Our\r\nGulf coast has gained in activity with the South's economic advance from\r\nslave to free labor, and from almost exclusive cotton planting to\r\ndiversified production combined with industries; and it will come into\r\nits own, in a maritime sense, when the opening of the Panama Canal will\r\ndivert from the Atlantic outlets those products of the Mississippi basin\r\nwhich will be seeking Trans-Pacific markets.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Interplay of geographic factors in coastlands.]\r\n\r\nA careful analysis of the life of coast peoples in relation to all the\r\nfactors of their land and sea environment shows that these are\r\nmultiform, and that none are negligible; it takes into consideration the\r\nextent, fertility, and relief of the littoral, its accessibility from\r\nthe land as well as from the sea, and its location in regard to outlying\r\nislands and to opposite shores, whether near or far; it holds in view\r\nnot only the small articulations that give the littoral ready contact\r\nwith the sea, but the relation of the seaboard to the larger continental\r\narticulations, whether it lies on an outrunning spur of a continental\r\nmass, like the Malacca, Yemen, or Peloponnesian coast, or upon a\r\nretiring inlet that brings it far into the heart of a continent, and\r\nprovides it with an extensive hinterland; and, finally, it never ignores\r\nthe nature of the bordering sea, which furnishes the school of\r\nseamanship and fixes the scope of maritime enterprise.\r\n\r\nAll these various elements of coastal environment are further\r\ndifferentiated in their use and their influence according to the\r\npurposes of those who come to tenant such tide-washed rims of the land.\r\nPirates seek intricate channels and hidden inlets for their lairs; a\r\nmerchant people select populous harbors and navigable river mouths;\r\nwould-be colonists settle upon fertile valleys opening into quiet bays,\r\ntill their fields, and use their coasts for placid maritime trade with\r\nthe mother country; interior peoples, pushed or pushing out to the tidal\r\nperiphery of their continent, with no maritime history behind them,\r\nbuild their fishing villages on protected lagoons, and, unless the\r\nshadowy form of some outlying island lure them farther, there they\r\ntarry, deaf to the siren song of the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n[412] Rudolph Reinhard, _Die Wichtigsten Deutschen Seehandelstädte_, pp.\r\n24, 25.

Variations in the\r\ngeographical forms of water are superficial and constantly changing;\r\nthey pass into one another by almost imperceptible gradations, shift\r\ntheir unstable outlines at the bidding of the mobile, restless element.\r\nIn contrast to the land, which is marked by diversity of geologic\r\nstructure and geographic form, the world of water is everywhere\r\napproximately the same, excepting only the difference in the mineral\r\ncomposition of sea water as opposed to that of spring and stream.\r\nTherefore, whenever man has touched it, it has moulded him in much the\r\nsame way, given the same direction to his activities, dictated the use\r\nof the same implements and methods of navigation. As maritime trader or\r\ncolonist, he has sailed to remote, unknown, yet familiar coasts, and\r\nfound himself as much at home as on his native shores. He has built up\r\nmaritime empires, the centre of whose dominion, race and commerce, falls\r\nsomewhere in the dividing yet uniting sea.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The water a factor in man's mobility.]\r\n\r\nMan must be grouped with the air and water as part of the mobile\r\nenvelope of the earth's surface. The mobility which maintains the unity\r\nof air and water has caused the unity of the human race. Abundant\r\nfacilities of dispersal often give animal forms a wide or cosmopolitan\r\ndistribution. Man, by appropriating the mobile forces in the air and\r\nwater to increase his own powers of locomotion, has become a\r\ncosmopolitan being, and made the human race reflect the unity of\r\natmosphere and hydrosphere.\r\n\r\nAlways the eternal unrest of the moving waters has knocked at the door\r\nof human inertia to arouse the sleeper within; always the flow of stream\r\nand the ebb of tide have sooner or later stirred the curiosity of the\r\nland-born barbarian about the unseen destination of these marching\r\nwaters. Rivers by the mere force of gravity have carried him to the\r\nshores of their common ocean, and placed him on this highway of the\r\nworld. Then from his sea-girt home, whether island or continent, he has\r\ntimidly or involuntarily followed the track which headland-dotted coast,\r\nor ocean current, or monsoon, or trade wind marked out for him across\r\nthe pathless waters, so that at the gray dawn of history he appears as\r\na cosmopolite, occupying every part of the habitable earth.\r\n\r\nThese sporadic oversea wanderings, with intervals of centuries or\r\nmilleniums between, opened to his occupancy strange and remote lands, in\r\nwhose isolation and new environment he developed fresh variations of\r\nmind, body and cultural achievements, to arm him with new weapons in the\r\nstruggle for existence. The sea which brought him bars him for a few\r\nages from his old home, till the tradition of his coming even is lost.\r\nThen with higher nautical development, the sea loses its barrier nature;\r\nmovements of people, and trade recross its surface to unite those who\r\nhave been long severed and much differentiated in their mutual\r\nremoteness. The ensuing friction and mingling weed out the less fit\r\nvariations of each, and combine in the new race the qualities able to\r\nfortify a higher type of man. Not only seas and oceans, but also\r\nmountains and deserts serve to isolate the migrant people who once has\r\ncrossed them; but wastes of water raise up the most effective barriers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Oceans and seas in universal history.]\r\n\r\nThe transformation of the ocean into a highway by the development of\r\nnavigation is a late occurrence in the history of man and is perhaps the\r\nhighest phase of his adaptation to environment, because an adaptation\r\nwhich has placed at his disposal that vast water area constituting\r\nthree-fourths of the earth's surface from which he had previously been\r\nexcluded. Moreover, it was adaptation to an alien and hostile element,\r\nwhose violent displays of power recurrently stimulated the human\r\nadjustment between attack and defense.\r\n\r\nBecause adaptation to the sea has been vastly more difficult than to the\r\nland, commensurate with the harder struggle it has brought greater\r\nintellectual and material rewards. This conquest of the sea is entitled\r\nto a peculiarly high place in history, because it has contributed to the\r\nunion of the various peoples of the world, has formed a significant part\r\nof the history of man, whether that history is economic, social,\r\npolitical or intellectual. Hence history has always staged its most\r\ndramatic acts upon the margin of seas and oceans; here always the plot\r\nthickens and gives promise of striking development. Rome of the seven\r\nhills pales before England of the \"Seven Seas.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The sea in universal history.]\r\n\r\nUniversal history loses half its import, remains an aggregate of parts,\r\nfails to yield its significance as a whole, if it does not continually\r\ntake into account the unifying factor of the seas. Indeed, no history is\r\nentitled to the name of universal unless it includes a record of human\r\nmovements and activities on the ocean, side by side with those on the\r\nland. Our school text-books in geography present a deplorable hiatus,\r\nbecause they fail to make a definite study of the oceans over which man\r\nexplores and colonizes and trades, as well as the land on which he\r\nplants and builds and sleeps.\r\n\r\nThe striking fact about the great World Ocean to-day is the manifold\r\nrelations which it has established between the dwellers on its various\r\ncoasts. Marine cables, steamer and sailing routes combine to form a\r\nnetwork of paths across the vast commons of the deep. Over these the\r\ncommercial, political, intellectual, or even purely migrant activities\r\nof human life move from continent to continent. The distinctive value of\r\nthe sea is that it promotes many-sided relations as opposed to the\r\none-sided relation of the land. France on her eastern frontier comes\r\ninto contact with people of kindred stock, living under similar\r\nconditions of climate and soil to her own; on her maritime border she is\r\nopen to intermittent intercourse with all continents and climes and\r\nraces of the world. To this sea border must be ascribed the share that\r\nFrance has taken in the history of North and South America, the West\r\nIndies, North and Equatorial Africa, India, China and the South Seas. So\r\nwe find the great maritime peoples of the world, from the Phoenicians to\r\nthe English, each figuring in the history of the world of its day, and\r\nhelping weave into a web of universal history the stories of its various\r\nparts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Origin of navigation.]\r\n\r\nMan's normal contact with the sea is registered in his nautical\r\nachievements. The invention of the first primitive means of navigation,\r\nsuggested by a floating log or bloated body of a dead animal, must have\r\nbeen an early achievement, of a great many peoples who lived near the\r\nwater, or who in the course of their wanderings found their progress\r\nobstructed by rivers; it belongs to a large class of similar discoveries\r\nwhich answer urgent and constantly recurring needs. It was, in all\r\nprobability, often made and as often lost again, until a growing habit\r\nof venturing beyond shore or river bank in search of better fishing, or\r\nof using the easy open waterways through the thick tangle of a primeval\r\nforest to reach fresh hunting grounds, established it as a permanent\r\nacquisition.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Primitive forms.]\r\n\r\nThe first devices were simply floats or rafts, made of light wood,\r\nreeds, or the hollow stems of plants woven together and often buoyed up\r\nby the inflated skins of animals. Floats of this character still survive\r\namong various peoples, especially in poorly timbered lands. The skin\r\nrafts which for ages have been the chief means of downstream traffic on\r\nthe rivers of Mesopotamia, consist of a square frame-work of interwoven\r\nreeds and branches, supported by the inflated skins of sheep and\r\ngoats;[528] they are guided by oars and poles down or across the current.\r\nThese were the primitive means by which Layard transported his winged\r\nbull from the ruins of Nineveh down to the Persian Gulf, and they were\r\nthe same which he found on the bas-reliefs of the ancient capital,\r\nshowing the methods of navigation three thousand years ago.[529] Similar\r\nskin rafts serve as ferry boats on the Sutlej, Shajok and other head\r\nstreams of the Indus.[530] They reappear in Africa as the only form of\r\nferry used by the Moors on the River Morbeya in Morocco; on the Nile,\r\nwhere the inflated skins are supplanted by earthen pots;[531] and on the\r\nYo River of semi-arid Sudan, where the platform is made of reeds and is\r\nbuoyed up by calabashes fastened beneath.[532]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Primitive craft in arid lands.]\r\n\r\nIn treeless lands, reeds growing on the margins of streams and lakes are\r\nutilized for the construction of boats. The Buduma islanders of Lake\r\nChad use clumsy skiffs eighteen feet long, made of hollow reeds tied\r\ninto bundles and then lashed together in a way to form a slight cavity\r\non top.[533] In the earliest period of Egyptian history this type of boat\r\nwith slight variations was used in the papyrus marshes of the Nile,[534]\r\nand it reappears as the ambatch boat which Schweinfurth observed on the\r\nupper White Nile.[535] It is in use far away among the Sayads or Fowlers,\r\nwho inhabit the reed-grown rim of the Sistan Lake in arid Persia.[536] As\r\nthe Peruvian balsa, it has been the regular means of water travel on\r\nLake Titicaca since the time of the Incas, and in more primitive form it\r\nappears among the Shoshone Indians of the Snake River Valley of Idaho,\r\nwho used this device in their treeless land to cross the streams, when\r\nthe water was too cold for swimming.[537] Still cruder rafts of reeds,\r\nwithout approach to boat form, were the sole vehicles of navigation\r\namong the backward Indians of San Francisco Bay, and were the prevailing\r\ncraft among the coast Indians farther south and about the Gulf of Lower\r\nCalifornia.[538] Trees abounded; but these remnant tribes of low\r\nintelligence, probably recent arrivals on the coast from the interior,\r\nequipped only with instruments of bone and stone, found the difficulty\r\nof working with wood prohibitive.\r\n\r\nThe second step in the elaboration of water conveyance was made when\r\nmere flotation was succeeded by various devices to secure displacement.\r\nThe evolution is obvious. The primitive raftsman of the Mesopotamian\r\nrivers wove his willow boughs and osiers into a large, round basket\r\nform, covered it with closely sewn skins to render it water-tight, and\r\nin it floated with his merchandise down the swift current from Armenia\r\nto Babylon. These were the boats which Herodotus saw on the\r\nEuphrates,[539] and which survive to-day.[540] According to Pliny, the\r\nancient Britons used a similar craft, framed of wicker-work and covered\r\nwith hide, in which they crossed the English and Irish channels to visit\r\ntheir kinsfolk on the opposite shores. This skin boat or coracle or\r\ncurrach still survives on the rivers of Wales and the west coast of\r\nIreland, where it is used by the fishermen and considered the safest\r\ncraft for stormy weather.[541] It recalls the \"bull-skin boat\" used in\r\npioneer days on the rivers of our western plains, and the skiffs serving\r\nas passenger ferries to-day on the rivers of eastern Tibet.[542] It\r\nreappears among the Arikara Indians of the upper Missouri,[543] and the\r\nSouth American tribes of the Gran Chaco.[544] The first wooden boat was\r\nmade of a tree trunk, hollowed out either by fire or axe. The wide\r\ngeographical distribution of the dug-out and its survival in isolated\r\nregions of highly civilized lands point it out as one of those necessary\r\nand obvious inventions that must have been made independently in\r\nvarious parts of the world.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Relation of the river to marine navigation.]\r\n\r\nThe quieter water of rivers and lakes offered the most favorable\r\nconditions for the feeble beginnings of navigation, but the step from\r\ninland to marine navigation was not always taken. The Egyptians, who had\r\nwell-constructed river and marine boats, resigned their maritime\r\ncommerce to Phoenicians and Greeks, probably, as has been shown, because\r\nthe silted channels and swamps of the outer Nile delta held them at\r\narm's length from the sea. Similarly the equatorial lakes of Central\r\nAfrica have proved fair schools of navigation, where the art has passed\r\nthe initial stages of development. The kingdom of Uganda on Victoria\r\nNyanza, at the time of Stanley's visit, could muster a war fleet of 325\r\nboats, a hundred of them measuring from fifty to seventy feet in length;\r\nthe largest were manned by a crew of sixty-four paddlers and could carry\r\nas many more fighting men.[545] The long plateau course of the mighty\r\nCongo has bred a race of river navigators, issuing from their riparian\r\nvillages to attack the traveler in big flotillas of canoes ranging from\r\nfifty to eighty-five feet in length, the largest of them driven through\r\nthe water by eighty paddlers and steered by eight more paddles in the\r\nstern.[546] But the Congo and lake boats are barred from the coast by a\r\nseries of cataracts, which mark the passage of the drainage streams down\r\nthe escarpment of the plateau.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Retarded navigation.]\r\n\r\nThere are peoples without boats or rafts of any description. Among this\r\nclass are the Central Australians, Bushmen, navigation. Hottentots and\r\nKaffirs of arid South Africa,[547] and with few exceptions also the\r\nDamaras. Even the coast members of these tribes only wade out into the\r\nshallow water on the beach to spear fish. The traveler moving northward\r\nfrom Cape Town through South Africa, across its few scant rivers, goes\r\nall the way to Ngami Lake before he sees anything resembling a canoe,\r\nand then only a rude dugout. Still greater is the number of people who,\r\nthough inhabiting well indented coasts, make little use of contact with\r\nthe sea. Navigation, unknown to many Australian coast tribes, is limited\r\nto miserable rafts of mangrove branches on the northwest seaboard, and\r\nto imperfect bark canoes with short paddles on the south; only in the\r\nnorth where Malayan influences are apparent does the hollowed tree-stem\r\nwith outrigger appear.[548] This retardation is not due to fear, because\r\nthe South Australian native, like the Fuegian, ventures several miles\r\nout to sea in his frail canoe; it is due to that deep-seated inertia\r\nwhich characterizes all primitive races, and for which the remote,\r\noutlying location of peninsular South America, Southern Africa and\r\nAustralia, before the arrival of the Europeans, afforded no antidote in\r\nthe form of stimulating contact with other peoples. But the Irish, who\r\nstarted abreast of the other northern Celts in nautical efficiency, who\r\nhad advantages of proximity to other shores, and in the early centuries\r\nof their history sailed to the far-away Faroes and even to Iceland,\r\npeopled southern Scotland by an oversea emigration, made piratical\r\ndescents upon the English coast, and in turn received colonies of bold\r\nScandinavian mariners, suffered an arrested development in navigation,\r\nand failed to become a sea-faring folk.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Regions of advanced navigation.]\r\n\r\nTurning from these regions of merely rudimentary navigation and\r\ninquiring where the highest efficiency in the art was obtained before\r\nthe spread of Mediterranean and European civilization, we find that this\r\ndistinction belongs to the great island world of the Pacific and to the\r\nneighboring lands of the Indian Ocean. Sailing vessels and outrigger\r\nboats of native design and construction characterize the whole\r\nsea-washed area of Indo-Malaysian civilization from Malacca to the\r\noutermost isles of the Pacific. The eastern rim of Asia, also, belongs\r\nto this wide domain of nautical efficiency, and the coast Indians of\r\nsouthern Alaska and British Columbia may possibly represent an eastern\r\nspur of the same,[549] thrown out in very remote times and maintained by\r\nthe advantageous geographic conditions of that indented, mountainous\r\ncoast. Adjoining this area on the north is the long-drawn Arctic\r\nseaboard of the Eskimo, who unaided have developed in their sealskin\r\nkayak and bidarka sea-going craft unsurpassed for the purposes of marine\r\nhunting and fishing, and who display a fearlessness and endurance born\r\nof long and enforced intimacy with the deep. Driven by the frozen\r\ndeserts of his home to seek his food chiefly in the water, the Eskimo,\r\nnevertheless, finds his access to the sea barred for long months of\r\nwinter by the jagged ice-pack along the shore.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Geographic conditions in Polynesia.]\r\n\r\nThe highest degree of intimacy is developed in that vast island-strewn\r\nstretch of the Pacific constituting Oceanica.[550] Here where a mild\r\nclimate enables the boatman race to make a companion of the deep, where\r\nevery landscape is a seascape, where every diplomatic visit or war\r\ncampaign, every trading journey or search for new coco-palm plantation\r\nmeans a voyage beyond the narrow confines of the home island, there\r\ndwells a race whose splendid chest and arm muscles were developed in the\r\ngymnasium of the sea; who, living on a paltry 515,000 square miles\r\n(1,320,300 square kilometers) of scattered fragments of land, but\r\nroaming over an ocean area of twenty-five million square miles, are not\r\nmore at home in their palm-wreathed islets than on the encompassing\r\ndeep. Migrations, voluntary and involuntary, make up their history.\r\nTheir trained sense of locality, enabling them to make voyages several\r\nhundred miles from home, has been mentioned by various explorers in\r\nPolynesia. The Marshall Islanders set down their geographical knowledge\r\nin maps which are fairly correct as to bearings but not as to distances.\r\nThe Ralick Islanders of this group make charts which include islands,\r\nroutes and currents.[551] Captain Cook was impressed by the geographical\r\nknowledge of the people of the South Seas. A native Tahitian made for\r\nhim a chart containing seventy-four islands, and gave an account of\r\nnearly sixty more.[552] Information and directions supplied by natives\r\nhave aided white explorers to many discoveries in these waters. Quiros,\r\nvisiting the Duff Islands in 1606, learned the location of Ticopia, one\r\nof the New Hebrides group, three hundred miles away. Not only the\r\nexcellent seamanship and the related pelagic fishing of the Polynesians\r\nbear the stamp of their predominant water environment; their mythology,\r\ntheir conception of a future state, the germs of their astronomical\r\nscience, are all born of the sea.\r\n\r\nThough the people living on the uttermost boundaries of this island\r\nworld are 6,000 miles (or 10,000 kilometers) apart, and might be\r\nexpected to be differentiated by the isolation of their island\r\nhabitats, nevertheless they all have the same fundamental\r\ncharacteristics of physique, language and culture from Guam to Easter\r\nIsle, reflecting in their unity the oneness of the encompassing ocean\r\nover which they circulate.[553]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mediterranean versus Atlantic seamanship.]\r\n\r\nMidway between these semi-aquatic Polynesians and those Arctic tribes\r\nwho are forced out upon the deep, to struggle with it rather than\r\nassociate with it, we find the inhabitants of the Mediterranean islands\r\nand peninsulas, who are favored by the mild climate and the tideless,\r\nfogless, stormless character of their sea. While such a body of water\r\ninvites intimacy, it does not breed a hardy or bold race of navigators;\r\nit is a nursery, scarcely a training school. Therefore, except for the\r\nfar-famed Dalmatian sailors, who for centuries have faced the storms\r\nsweeping down from the Dinaric Alps over the turbulent surface of the\r\nAdriatic, Mediterranean seamanship does not command general confidence\r\non the high seas. Therefore it is the German, English and Dutch\r\nsteamship lines that are to-day the chief ocean carriers from Italian\r\nports to East Africa, Asia, Australia, North and South America, despite\r\nthe presence of native lines running from Genoa to Buenos Ayres.\r\nMontevideo and New York; just as it was the Atlantic states of Europe,\r\nand only these and all of these, except Germany, who, trained to venture\r\nout into the fogs and storms and unmarked paths of the _mare\r\ntenebrosum_, participated in the early voyages to the Americas. One\r\nafter the other they came--Norwegians, Spaniards, Portuguese, English,\r\nFrench, Dutch, Swedes and Danes. The anthropo-geographical principle is\r\nnot invalidated by the fact that Spain and England were guided in their\r\ninitial trans-Atlantic voyages by Italian navigators, like Columbus,\r\nCabot and Amerigo Vespucci. The long maritime experience of Italy and\r\nits commercial relations with the Orient, reaching back into ancient\r\ntimes, furnished abundant material for the researches and speculations\r\nof such practical theorists; but Italy's location fixed the shores of\r\nthe Mediterranean as her natural horizon, narrowed her vision to its\r\nshorter radius. Her obvious interest in the preservation of the old\r\nroutes to the Orient made her turn a deaf ear to plans aiming to divert\r\nEuropean commerce to trans-Atlantic routes. Italy's entrance upon the\r\nhigh seas was, therefore, reluctant and late, retarded by the necessity\r\nof outgrowing the old circumscribed outlook of the enclosed basin before\r\nadopting the wider vision of the open ocean. Venice and Genoa were\r\ncrippled not only by the discovery of the sea route to India, but also\r\nby their adherence to old thalassic means and methods of navigation\r\ninadequate for the high seas.[554] However, these Mediterranean sea folk\r\nare being gradually drawn out of their seclusion, as is proved by the\r\nincrease of Italian oceanic lines and the recent installation of an\r\nHellenic steamship line between Piræus and New York.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Three geographic stages of maritime development.]\r\n\r\nThe size of a sea or ocean is a definite factor in its power to attract\r\nor repel maritime ventures, especially in the earlier stages of nautical\r\ndevelopment. A broken, indented coast means not only a longer and\r\nbroader zone of contact between the inhabitants and the sea; it means\r\nalso the breaking up of the adjacent expanse of water into so many\r\nalcoves, in which fisherman, trader and colonist may become at home, and\r\nprepare for maritime ventures farther afield. The enclosed or marginal\r\nsea tempts earlier because it can be compassed by coastwise navigation;\r\nthen by the proximity of its opposite shores and its usual generous\r\nequipment with islands, the next step to crosswise navigation is\r\nencouraged. For the earliest stages of maritime development, only the\r\nsmaller articulations of the coast and the inshore fringe of sea inlets\r\ncount. This is shown in the primitive voyages of the Greeks, before they\r\nhad ventured into the Euxine or west of the forbidding Cape Malia; and\r\nin the \"inside passage\" navigation of the Indians of southern Alaska,\r\nBritish Columbia, and Chile, who have never stretched their nautical\r\nventures beyond the outermost rocks of their skerry-walled coast.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Influence of enclosed seas upon navigation.]\r\n\r\nA second stage is reached when an enclosed basin is at, hand to widen\r\nthe maritime horizon, and when this larger field is exploited in all its\r\ncommercial, colonial and industrial possibilities, as was done by the\r\nPhoenicians and Greeks in the Mediterranean, the Hanse Towns in the\r\nBaltic, the Dutch and English in the North Sea. The third and final\r\nstage is reached when the nursery of the inshore estuary or gulf and the\r\nelementary school of the enclosed basin are in turn outgrown, and the\r\nlarger maritime spirit moves on to the open ocean for its field of\r\noperation. It is a significant fact that the Norse, bred to the water in\r\ntheir fiords and channels behind their protecting \"skerry-wall,\" then\r\ntrained in the stormy basins of the North and Irish Seas, were naturally\r\nthe first people of Europe to cross the Atlantic, because the Atlantic\r\nof their shores, narrowing like all oceans and seas toward the north,\r\nassumes almost the character of an enclosed basin. The distance from\r\nNorway to Greenland is only 1,800 miles, little more than that across\r\nthe Arabian Sea between Africa and India. We trace, therefore, a certain\r\nanalogy between the physical subdivisions of the world of water into\r\ninlet, marginal sea and ocean, and the anthropo-geographical gradations\r\nin maritime development.\r\n\r\nThe enclosed or marginal sea seems a necessary condition for the advance\r\nbeyond coastwise navigation and the much later step to the open ocean.\r\nContinents without them, like Africa, except for its frontage upon the\r\nMediterranean and the Red Sea, have shown no native initiative in\r\nmaritime enterprise. Africa was further cursed by the mockery of desert\r\ncoasts along most of her scant thalassic shores. In the Americas, we\r\nfind the native races compassing a wide maritime field only in the\r\nArctic, where the fragmentary character of the continent breaks up the\r\nocean into Hudson's Bay, Davis Strait, Baffin Bay, Gulf of Boothia,\r\nMelville Sound and Bering Sea; and in the American Mediterranean of the\r\nCaribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico. The excellent seamanship developed in\r\nthe archipelagoes of southern Alaska and Chile remained abortive for\r\nmaritime expansion, despite a paucity of local resources and the spur of\r\nhunger, owing to the lack of a marginal sea; but in the Caribbean basin,\r\nthe Arawaks and later the Caribs spread from the southern mainland as\r\nfar as Cuba.[555] [See map page 101.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Enclosed seas as areas of ethnic and cultural assimilation.]\r\n\r\nEnclosed or marginal seas were historically the most important sections\r\nof the ocean prior to 1492. Apart from the widening of the maritime\r\nhorizon which they give to their bordering people, each has the further\r\nadvantage of constituting an area of close vicinal grouping and constant\r\ninterchange of cultural achievements, by which the civilization of the\r\nwhole basin tends to become elevated and unified. This unification\r\nfrequently extends to race also, owing to the rapidity of maritime\r\nexpansion and the tendency to ethnic amalgamation characteristic of all\r\ncoast regions. We recognize an area of Mediterranean civilization from\r\nthe Isthmus of Suez to the Sacred Promontory of Portugal, and in this\r\narea a long-headed, brunette Mediterranean race, clearly unified as to\r\nstock, despite local differentiations of culture, languages and nations\r\nin the various islands, peninsulas and other segregated coastal regions\r\nof this sea.[556] The basin appears therefore as an historical whole; for\r\nin it a certain group of peoples concentrated their common efforts,\r\nwhich crossed and criss-crossed from shore to shore. Phoenicia's trade\r\nranged westward to the outer coasts of Spain, and later Barcelona's\r\nmaritime enterprises reached east to the Levant. Greece's commercial and\r\ncolonial relations embraced the Crimea and the mouth of the Rhone, and\r\nGenoa's extended east to the Crimea again. The Saracens, on reaching the\r\nMediterranean edge of the Arabian peninsula, swept the southern coasts\r\nand islands, swung up the western rim of the basin to the foot of the\r\nPyrenees, and taught the sluggish Spaniards the art of irrigation\r\npracticed on the garden slopes of Yemen. The ships of the Crusaders from\r\nVenice, Genoa and Marseilles anchored in the ports of Mohammedanized\r\nSyria, brought the symbol of the cross back to its birthplace In\r\nJerusalem, but carried away with them countless suggestions from the\r\nfinished industries of the East. Here was give and take, expansion and\r\ncounter-expansion, conquest and expulsion, all together making up a\r\ngreat sum of reciprocal relations embracing the whole basin, the outcome\r\nof that close geographical connection which every sharply defined sea\r\nestablishes between the coasts which it washes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: North Sea and Baltic basins.]\r\n\r\nThe same thing has come to pass in the North Sea. Originally Celtic on\r\nits western or British side, as opposed to its eastern or Germanic\r\ncoast, it has been wholly Teutonized on that flank also from the Strait\r\nof Dover to the Firth of Tay, and sprinkled with Scandinavian settlers\r\nfrom the Firth of Tay northward to Caithness.[557] The eleventh century\r\nsaw this ethnic unification achieved, and the end of the Middle Ages\r\nwitnessed the diffusion of the elements of a common civilization through\r\nthe agency of commerce from Bruges to Bergen. The Baltic, originally\r\nTeutonic only on its northern and western shores, has in historical\r\ntimes become almost wholly Teutonic, including even the seaboard of\r\nFinland and much of the coast provinces of Russia.[558] Unification of\r\ncivilization attended this unification of race. In its period of\r\ngreatest historical significance from the twelfth to the seventeenth\r\ncentury, the Baltic played the rôle of a northern Mediterranean.[559] The\r\ncountless shuttles of the Hanse ships wove a web of commercial\r\nintercourse between its remotest shores. Novgorod and Abö were in\r\nconstant communication with Lübeck and Stralsund;[560] and Wisby, on the\r\nisland of Gotland at the great crossroads of the Baltic,[561] had the\r\nfocal significance of the Piræus in ancient Aegean trade.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bering Sea.]\r\n\r\nIf we turn to Asia, we find that even the unfavorable Arctic location of\r\nBering Sea has been unable to rob it entirely of historical\r\nsignificance. This is the one spot where a native American race has\r\ntransplanted itself by its natural expansion to Asiatic shores. The\r\ncircular rim and island-dotted surface have guided Eskimo emigrants to\r\nthe coast of the Chukchian Peninsula, where they have become partly\r\nassimilated in dress and language to the local Chukches.[562] The same\r\nconditions also facilitated the passage of a few Chukches across Bering\r\nStrait to the Alaskan side. At Pak (or Peck) on East Cape and on Diomed\r\nIsland, situated in the narrowest part of Bering Strait, are the great\r\nintercontinental markets of the polar tribes. Here American furs have\r\nfor many decades been exchanged for the reindeer skins of northern\r\nSiberia and Russian goods from far-away Moscow.[563] Only the enclosed\r\ncharacter of the sea, reported by the Danish explorer Vitus Bering,\r\ntempted the land-bred Russians, who reached the northeastern coast of\r\nSiberia at the middle of the eighteenth century, to launch their leaky\r\nboats of unseasoned timber, push across to the American continent, and\r\nmake this whole Bering basin a Russian sea;[564] just as a few decades\r\nbefore, when land exploration of Kamchatka had revealed the enclosed\r\ncharacter of the Sea of Okhotsk, the Russian pioneers took a straight\r\ncourse across the water to their Pacific outpost of Petropavlovsk near\r\nthe southern end of the peninsula. But even before the coming of the\r\nSlavs to its shores, the Sea of Okhotsk seems to have been an area of\r\nnative commercial and ethnic intercourse from the Amur River in Siberia\r\nin a half circle to the east, through Sakhalin, Yezo, the Kurile Islands\r\nand southern Kamchatka,[565] noticeably where the rim of the basin\r\npresented the scantiest supply of land and where, therefore, its meager\r\nresources had to be eked out by fisheries and trade on the sea.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Red Sea basin.]\r\n\r\nOn the southwest margin of Asia, the Red Sea, despite its desert shores,\r\nhas maintained the influence of its intercontinental location and linked\r\nthe neighboring elements of Africa and Asia. Identity of climatic\r\nconditions on both sides of this long rift valley has facilitated ethnic\r\nexchanges, and made it the center of what Ratzel calls the \"Red Sea\r\ngroup of peoples,\" related in race and culture.[566] The great ethnic\r\nsolvent here has been Semitic. Under the spur of Islam, the Arabs by\r\n1514 had made the Red Sea an Arabian and Mohammedan sea. They had their\r\ntowns or trading stations at Zeila on the African side of the Strait of\r\nBab-el-Mandeb, at Dalaqua, the port of Abyssinia, at Massowa, Suakin,\r\nand other towns, so that this coast too was called Arabia Felix.[567]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Assimilation facilitated by ethnic kinship.]\r\n\r\nVicinal location about an enclosed basin produces more rapidly a\r\nunification of race and culture, when some ethnic relationship and\r\naffinity already exists among the peoples inhabiting its shores. As in\r\nthe ancient and medieval Mediterranean, so in the Yellow Sea of Asia,\r\nthe working of this principle is apparent. The presence along its coasts\r\nof divergent but kindred peoples like the Chinese, Koreans and Japanese,\r\nallowed these to be easily assimilated to a Yellow Sea race and to\r\nabsorb quickly any later infusion, like that of the Tatars and Manchus.\r\nChina, by reason of its larger area, long-drawn coast, massive\r\npopulation, and early civilization, was the dominant factor in this\r\nbasin; Korea and Japan were its culture colonies-a fact that justifies\r\nthe phrase calling \"China the Rome of the Far East.\" Historical Japan\r\nbegan on the island of Kiu-sui, facing the Yellow Sea. Like Korea, it\r\nderived its writing, its fantastic medical notions, its industrial\r\nmethods, some features of its government administration, its Buddhism\r\nand its religion of Confucius from the people about the lower\r\nHoangho.[568] Three centuries ago Japan had its colony on Korean soil at\r\nFusan, the Calais of the East.[569] For purposes of piracy and smuggling\r\nJapanese penetrated far up the rivers of China. Korea has kept in touch\r\nwith China by an active trade and diplomatic relations through the\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nBut to-day China is going to school to Japan. Since Japan renounced\r\nher policy of seclusion in 1868 along with her antiquated form of\r\ngovernment, and since Korea has been forced out of her hermit life,\r\nthe potency of vicinal location around this enclosed sea has been\r\nsuddenly restored. The enforced opening of the treaty ports of Japan,\r\nKorea and China simply prepared the way for this basin to reassert its\r\npower to unite, and to unite now more closely and effectively than\r\never before, under the law of increasing territorial areas. The\r\nstimulus was first communicated to the basin from without, from the\r\ntrading nations of the Occident and that new-born Orient rising from\r\nthe sea on the California shores. Japan has responded most promptly\r\nand most actively to these over-sea stimuli, just as England has, of\r\nall Europe, felt most strongly the reflex influences from\r\ntrans-Atlantic lands. The awakening of this basin has started,\r\ntherefore, from its seaward rim; its star has risen in the east. It is\r\nin the small countries of the world that such stars rise. The\r\ncompressed energies of Japan, stirred by over-sea contact and an\r\nimproved government at home, have overleaped the old barriers and are\r\nfollowing the lines of slight resistance which this land-bound sea\r\naffords. Helped by the bonds of geographical conditions and of race,\r\nshe has begun to convert China and Korea into her culture colonies.\r\nThe on-looking world feels that the ultimate welfare of China and\r\nKorea can be best nurtured by Japan, which will thus pay its old debt\r\nto the Middle Kingdom.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chinese expansion seaward.]\r\n\r\nDespite the fact that China's history has always had a decidedly inland\r\ncharacter, that its political expansion has been landward, that it has\r\npracticed most extensively and successively internal colonization, and\r\nthat its policy of exclusion has tended to deaden its outlook toward the\r\nPacific, nevertheless China's direct intercourse with the west and its\r\nwestward-directed influence have never, in point of significance, been\r\ncomparable with that toward the east and south. Here a succession of\r\nmarginal seas offered easy water-paths, dotted with way stations, to\r\ntheir outermost rim in Japan, the Philippines and remote Australia.\r\nAbout the South China Sea, the Gulf of Siam, the Sulu, Celebes, and Java\r\nSeas, the coastal regions of the outlying islands have for centuries\r\nreceived Chinese goods and culture, and a blend of that obstinately\r\nassertive Chinese blood.\r\n\r\nThe strength of these influences has decreased with every increase of\r\ndistance from the indented coasts and teeming, seafaring population of\r\nSouth China, and with every decrease in race affinity. They have left\r\nonly faint traces on the alien shores of far-away Australia. The\r\ndivergent ethnic stock of the widespread Malay world has been little\r\nsusceptible to these influences, which are therefore weak in the remoter\r\nislands, but clearly discernible on the coasts of the Philippines,[570]\r\nBorneo, the nearer Sunda Islands, and the peninsula of Malacca, where\r\nthe Chinese have had trading colonies for centuries.[571] But in the\r\neastern half of Farther India, which is grouped with China by land as\r\nwell as by sea, and whose race stock is largely if not purely Mongolian,\r\nthese influences are very marked, so that the whole continental rim of\r\nthe South China Sea, from Formosa to the Isthmus of Malacca, is strongly\r\nassimilated in race and culture. Tongking, exposed to those modifying\r\ninfluences which characterize all land frontiers, as well as to\r\ncoastwise intercourse, is in its people and civilization merely a\r\ntranscript of China. The coast districts and islands of Annam are\r\noccupied by Chinese as far as the hills of Cambodia, and the name of\r\nCochin China points to the origin of its predominant population.\r\nOne-sixth of the inhabitants of Siam are Chinese, some of whom have\r\nfiltered through the northern border; Bangkok, the capital, has a large\r\nChinese quarter. The whole economic life and no small part of the\r\nintellectual life of the eastern face of Farther India south to\r\nSingapore is centered in the activity of the Chinese.[572]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Importance of zonal and continental location.]\r\n\r\nThe historical significance of an enclosed sea basin depends upon its\r\nzonal location and its position in relation to the surrounding lands. We\r\nobserve a steady decrease of historical importance from south to north\r\nthrough the connected series of the Yellow, Japan, Okhotsk, Bering Seas\r\nand the Arctic basin, miscalled ocean. The far-northern location of the\r\nBaltic, with its long winters of ice-bound ports and its glaciated\r\nlands, retarded its inclusion in the field of history, curtailed its\r\nimportant historical period, and reduced the intensity of its historical\r\nlife, despite the brave, eager activity of the Hanseatic League. The\r\nMediterranean had the advantage, not only of a more favorable zonal\r\nsituation, but of a location at the meeting place of three continents\r\nand on the line of maritime traffic across the eastern hemisphere from\r\nthe Atlantic to the Pacific.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Thalassic character of the Indian Ocean.]\r\n\r\nThese advantages it shares in some degree with the Indian Ocean, which,\r\nas Ratzel justly argues, is not a true ocean, at best only half an\r\nocean. North of the equator, where it is narrowed and enclosed like an\r\ninland sea, it loses the hydrospheric and atmospheric characteristics of\r\na genuine ocean. Currents and winds are disorganized by the\r\nclose-hugging lands. Here the steady northeast trade wind is replaced by\r\nthe alternating air currents of the northeast and southwest monsoons,\r\nwhich at a very early date[573] enabled merchant vessels to break away\r\nfrom their previous slow, coastwise path, and to strike a straight\r\ncourse on their voyage between Arabia or the east coast of Africa and\r\nIndia.[574] Moreover, this northern half of the Indian Ocean looks like a\r\nlarger Mediterranean with its southern coast removed. It has the same\r\neast and west series of peninsulas harboring differentiated\r\nnationalities, the same northward running recesses, but all on a larger\r\nscale. It has linked together the history of Asia and Africa; and by the\r\nRed Sea and Persian Gulf, it has drawn Europe and the Mediterranean\r\ninto its sphere of influence. At the western corner of the Indian Ocean\r\na Semitic people, the Arabs of Oman and Yemen, here first developed\r\nbrilliant maritime activity, like their Phoenician kinsmen of the\r\nLebanon seaboard. Similar geographic conditions in their home lands and\r\na nearly similar intercontinental location combined to make them the\r\nmiddlemen of three continents. Just as the Phoenicians, by way of the\r\nMediterranean, reached and roused slumberous North Africa into\r\nhistorical activity and became the medium for the distribution of\r\nEgypt's culture, so these Semites of the Arabian shores knocked at the\r\nlong-closed doors of East Africa facing on the Indian basin, and drew\r\nthis region into the history of southern Asia. Thus the Africa of the\r\nenclosed seas was awakened to some measure of historical life, while the\r\nAfrica of the wide Atlantic slept on.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The sea route to the Orient.]\r\n\r\nFrom the dawn of history the northern Indian Ocean was a thoroughfare.\r\nAlexander the Great's rediscovery of the old sea route to the Orient\r\nsounds like a modern event in relation to the gray ages behind it. Along\r\nthis thoroughfare Indian colonists, traders, and priests carried the\r\nelements of Indian civilization to the easternmost Sunda Isles; and\r\nOriental wares, sciences and religions moved westward to the margin of\r\nEurope and Africa. The Indian Ocean produced a civilization of its own,\r\nwith which it colored a vast semi-circle of land reaching from Java to\r\nAbyssinia, and more faintly, owing to the wider divergence of race, the\r\nfurther stretch from Abyssinia to Mozambique.\r\n\r\nThus the northern Indian Ocean, owing to its form, its location in the\r\nangle between Asia and Africa and the latitude where, round the whole\r\nearth, \"the zone of greatest historical density\" begins, and especially\r\nits location just southeast of the Mediterranean as the eastern\r\nextension of that maritime track of ancient and modern times between\r\nEurope and China, has been involved in a long series of historical\r\nevents. From the historical standpoint, prior to 1492 it takes a far\r\nhigher place than the Atlantic and Pacific, owing to its nature as an\r\nenclosed sea.[575] But like all such basins, this northern Indian Ocean\r\nattained its zenith of historical importance in early times. In the\r\nsixteenth century it suffered a partial eclipse, which passed only with\r\nthe opening of the Suez Canal. During this interval, however, the\r\nPortuguese. Dutch and English had rounded the Cape of Good Hope and\r\nentered this basin on its open or oceanic side. By their trading\r\nstations, which soon traced the outlines of its coasts from Sofala in\r\nSouth Africa around to Java, they made this ocean an alcove of the\r\nAtlantic, and embodied its events in the Atlantic period of history. It\r\nis this open or oceanic side which differentiates the Indian Ocean\r\nphysically, and therefore historically, from a genuine enclosed sea.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Limitation of small area in enclosed seas.]\r\n\r\nThe limitation of every enclosed or marginal sea lies in its small area\r\nand in the relatively restricted circle of its bordering lands. Only\r\nsmall peninsulas and islands can break its surface, and short stretches\r\nof coast combine to form its shores. It affords, therefore, only limited\r\nterritories as goals for expansion, restricted resources and populations\r\nto furnish the supply and demand of trade. What lands could the\r\nMediterranean present to the colonial outlook of the Greeks comparable\r\nto the North America of the expanding English or the Brazil of the\r\nPortuguese? Yet the Mediterranean as a colonial field had great\r\nadvantages in point of size over the Baltic, which is only one-sixth as\r\nlarge (2,509,500 and 431,000 square kilometers respectively), and\r\nespecially over the Red Sea and Persian Gulf, whose effective areas were\r\ngreatly reduced by the aridity of their surrounding lands. But the\r\nprecocious development and early cessation of growth marking all\r\nMediterranean national life have given to this basin a variegated\r\nhistory; and in every period and every geographical region of it, from\r\nancient Phoenicia to modern Spain and Italy, the early exhaustion of\r\nresources and dwarfing of political ideals which characterize most small\r\nareas become increasingly conspicuous. The history of Sweden, Denmark,\r\nand the Hanse Towns in the Baltic tells the same story, the story of a\r\nhothouse plant, forced in germination and growth, then stifled in the\r\nclose air.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Successive maritime periods in history.]\r\n\r\nGrowth demands space. Therefore, the progress of history has been\r\nattended by an advance from smaller to larger marine areas, with a\r\nconstant increase in those manifold relations between peoples and lands\r\nwhich the water is able to establish. Every great epoch of history has\r\nhad its own sea, and every succeeding epoch has enlarged its maritime\r\nfield. The Greek had the Aegean, the Roman the whole Mediterranean, to\r\nwhich the Middle Ages made an addition in the North Sea and Baltic. The\r\nmodern period has had the Atlantic, and the twentieth century is now\r\nentering upon the final epoch of the World Ocean. The gradual inclusion\r\nof this World Ocean in the widened scope of history has been due to the\r\nexpansion of European peoples, who, for the past twenty centuries, have\r\nbeen the most far-reaching agents in the making of universal history.\r\nOwing to the location and structure of their continent, they have always\r\nfound the larger outlet in a western sea. In the south the field widened\r\nfrom the Phoenician Sea to the Aegean, then to the Mediterranean, on to\r\nthe Atlantic, and across it to its western shores; in the north it moved\r\nfrom the quiet Baltic to the tide-swept North Sea and across the North\r\nAtlantic. Only the South Atlantic brought European ships to the great\r\nworld highway of the South Seas, and gave them the choice of an eastern\r\nor western route to the Pacific. Every new voyage in the age of\r\ndiscovery expanded the historical horizon; and every improvement in the\r\ntechnique of navigation has helped to eliminate distance and reduced\r\nintercourse on the World Ocean to the time-scale of the ancient\r\nMediterranean.\r\n\r\nIt would be a mistake, however, to suppose that the larger oceanic\r\nhorizon has meant a corresponding increase in the relative content and\r\nimportance of history for the known world of each period. Such an\r\nintense, concentrated national life as occurred in those little\r\nMediterranean countries in ancient times is not duplicated now, unless\r\nwe find a parallel in Japan's recent career in the Yellow Sea basin.\r\nThere was something as cosmic in the colonial ventures of the Greeks to\r\nthe wind-swept shores of the Crimea or barbarous wilds of Massilia, as\r\nin the establishment of English settlements on the brimming rivers of\r\nVirginia or the torrid coast of Malacca. Alexander's conquest of the\r\nAsiatic rim of the Mediterranean and Rome's political unification of the\r\nbasin had a significance for ancient times comparable with the\r\nRussification of northern Asia and the establishment of the British\r\nEmpire for our day.\r\n\r\nThe ocean has always performed one function in the evolution of history;\r\nit has provided the outlet for the exercise of redundant national\r\npowers. The abundance of opportunity which it presents to these\r\ndisengaged energies depends upon the size, location and other geographic\r\nconditions of the bordering lands. These opportunities are limited in an\r\nenclosed basin, larger in the oceans, and largest in the northern halves\r\nof the oceans, owing to the widening of all land-masses towards the\r\nnorth and the consequent contraction of the oceans and seas in the same\r\nlatitudes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Contrasted historical rôles of northern and southern\r\nhemispheres.]\r\n\r\nA result of this grouping is the abundance of land in the northern\r\nhemisphere, and the vast predominance of water in the southern, by\r\nreason of which these two hemispheres have each assumed a distinct rôle\r\nin history. The northern hemisphere offers the largest advantages for\r\nthe habitation of man, and significantly enough, contains a population\r\nfive times that of the southern hemisphere. The latter, on the other\r\nhand, with its vast, unbroken water areas, has been the great oceanic\r\nhighway for circum-mundane exploration and trade. This great water\r\ngirdle of the South Seas had to be discovered before the spherical form\r\nof the earth could be proven. In the wide territory of the northern\r\nhemisphere civilization has experienced an uninterrupted development,\r\nfirst in the Old World, because this offered in its large area north of\r\nthe equator the fundamental conditions for rapid evolution; then it was\r\ntransplanted with greatest success to North America. The northern\r\nhemisphere contains, therefore, \"the zone of greatest historical\r\ndensity,\" from which the track of the South Seas is inconveniently\r\nremote. Hence we find in recent decades a reversion to the old east-west\r\npath along the southern rim of Eurasia, now perfected by the Suez Canal,\r\nand to be extended in the near future around the world by the union of\r\nthe Pacific with the Caribbean Sea at Panama; so that finally the\r\nnorthern hemisphere will have its own circum-mundane waterway, along the\r\nline of greatest intercontinental intercourse.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Size of the oceans]\r\n\r\nThe size of the ocean as a whole is so enormous, and yet its various\r\nsubdivisions are so uniform in their physical aspect, that their\r\ndifferences of size produce less conspicuous historical effects than\r\ntheir diversity of area would lead one to expect. A voyage across the\r\n177,000 square miles (453,500 square kilometers) of the Black Sea does\r\nnot differ materially from one across the 979,000 square miles\r\n(2,509,500 square kilometers) of the Mediterranean; or a voyage across\r\nthe 213,000 square miles (547,600 square kilometers) of the North Sea,\r\nfrom one across the three-hundredfold larger area of the Pacific. The\r\nocean does not, like the land, wear upon its surface the evidences and\r\neffects of its size; it wraps itself in the same garment of blue waves\r\nor sullen swell, wherever it appears; but the outward cloak of the land\r\nvaries from zone to zone. The significant anthropo-geographical\r\ninfluence of the size of the oceans, as opposed to that of the smaller\r\nseas, comes from the larger circle of lands which the former open to\r\nmaritime enterprise. For primitive navigation, when the sailor crept\r\nfrom headland to headland and from island to island, the small enclosed\r\nbasin with its close-hugging shores did indeed offer the best\r\nconditions. To-day, only the great tonnage of ocean-going vessels may\r\nreflect in some degree the vast areas they traverse between continent\r\nand continent. Coasting craft and ships designed for local traffic in\r\nenclosed seas are in general smaller, as in the Baltic, though the\r\nenormous commerce of the Great Lakes, which constitute in effect an\r\ninland sea, demands immense vessels.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Neutrality of the seas, its evolution.]\r\n\r\nThe vast size of the oceans has been the basis of their neutrality. The\r\nneutrality of the seas is a recent idea in political history. The\r\nprinciple arose in connection with the oceans, and from them was\r\nextended to the smaller basins, which previously tended to be regarded\r\nas private political domains. Their limited area, which enabled them to\r\nbe compassed, enabled them also to be appropriated, controlled and\r\npoliced. The Greek excluded the Phoenician from the Aegean and made it\r\nan Hellenic sea. Carthage and Tarentum tried to draw the dead line for\r\nRoman merchantmen at the Lacinian Cape, the doorway into the Ionian\r\nSea, and thereby involved themselves in the famous Punic Wars. The whole\r\nMediterranean became a Roman sea, the _mare nostrum_. Pompey's fleet was\r\nable to police it effectively and to exterminate the pirates in a few\r\nmonths, as Cicero tells us in his oration for the Manilian Law. Venice,\r\nby the conquest of the Dalmatian pirates in 991 prepared to make herself\r\n_dominatrix Adriatici maris_, as she was later called. By the thirteenth\r\ncentury she had secured full command of the sea, spoke of it as \"the\r\nGulf,\" in her desire to stamp it as a _mare clausum_, maintained in it a\r\npowerful patrol fleet under a _Capitan in Golfo_, whose duty it was to\r\npolice the sea for pirates and to seize all ships laden with contraband\r\ngoods. She claimed and enforced the right of search of foreign vessels,\r\nand compelled them to discharge two-thirds of their cargo at Venice,\r\nwhich thus became the clearing house of the whole Adriatic. She even\r\nappealed to the Pope for confirmation of her dominion over the sea.[576]\r\nSweden and Denmark strove for a _dominum maris Baltici_; but the Hanse\r\nTowns of northern Germany secured the maritime supremacy in the basin,\r\nkept a toll-gate at its entrance, and levied toll or excluded merchant\r\nships at their pleasure, a right which after the fall of the Hanseatic\r\npower was assumed by Denmark and maintained till 1857. \"The Narrow Seas\"\r\nover which England claimed sovereignty from 1299 to 1805, and on which\r\nshe exacted a salute from every foreign vessel, included the North Sea\r\nas far as Stadland Cape in Norway, the English Channel, and the Bay of\r\nBiscay down to Cape Finisterre in northern Spain.[577]\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the sixteenth century the Indian Ocean was a\r\nPortuguese sea. Spain was trying to monopolize the Caribbean and even\r\nthe Pacific Ocean. But the immense areas of these pelagic fields of\r\nenterprise, and the rapid intrusion into them of other colonial powers\r\nsoon rendered obsolete in practice the principle of the _mare clausum_,\r\nand introduced that of the _mare liberum_. The political theory of the\r\nfreedom of the seas seems to have needed vigorous support even toward\r\nthe end of the seventeenth century. At this time we find writers like\r\nSalmasius and Hugo Grotius invoking it to combat Portuguese monopoly of\r\nthe Indian Ocean as a _mare clausum_. Grotius in a lengthy dissertation\r\nupholds the thesis that \"_Jure gentium quibusvis ad quosvis liberam\r\nesse navigationem_,\" and supports it by an elaborate argument and\r\nquotations from the ancient poets, philosophers, orators and\r\nhistorians.[578] This principle was not finally acknowledged by England\r\nas applicable to \"The Narrow Seas\" till 1805. Now, by international\r\nagreement, political domain extends only to one marine league from shore\r\nor within cannon range. The rest of the vast water area remains the\r\nunobstructed highway of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n[528] S.M. Zwemer, Arabia the Cradle of Islam, p. 135.

Essentially a terrestrial animal, he\r\nmakes his sojourn upon the deep only temporary, even when as a fisherman\r\nhe is kept upon the sea for months during the long season of the catch,\r\nor when, as whaler, year-long voyages are necessitated by the\r\nremoteness and expanse of his field of operations. Yet even this rule\r\nhas its exceptions. The Moro Bajan are sea gypsies of the southern\r\nPhilippines and the Sulu archipelago, of whom Gannett says \"their home\r\nis in their boats from the cradle to the grave, and they know no art but\r\nthat of fishing.\" Subsisting almost exclusively on sea food, they wander\r\nabout from shore to shore, one family to a boat, in little fleets of\r\nhalf a dozen sail; every floating community has its own headman called\r\nthe Captain Bajan, who embodies all their slender political\r\norganization. When occasionally they abandon their rude boats for a\r\ntime, they do not abandon the sea, but raise their huts on piles above\r\nthe water on some shelving beach. Like the ancient lake-dwellers of\r\nSwitzerland and Italy, only in death do they acknowledge their ultimate\r\nconnection with the solid land. They never bury their dead at sea, but\r\nalways on a particular island, to which the funeral cortege of rude\r\noutrigged boats moves to the music of the paddle's dip.[579]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Protection of a water frontier.]\r\n\r\nThe margin of river, lake and sea has always attracted the first\r\nsettlements of man because it offered a ready food supply in its animal\r\nlife and an easy highway for communication. Moreover, a water front made\r\na comparatively safe frontier for the small, isolated communities which\r\nconstituted primitive societies. The motive of protection, dominant in\r\nthe savage when selecting sites for his villages, led him to place them\r\non the pear-shaped peninsula formed by a river loop, or on an island in\r\nthe stream or off the coast; or to sever his connection with the solid\r\nland, whence attack might come, and provide himself with a boundary\r\nwaste of water by raising his hut on piles above the surface of lake,\r\nriver or sheltered seacoast, within easy reach of the shore. In this\r\nlocation the occupant of the pile dwelling has found all his needs\r\nanswered--fishing grounds beneath and about his hut, fields a few\r\nhundred feet away on shore, easily reached by his dug-out canoe, and a\r\nplace of retreat from a land enemy, whether man or wild beast.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ancient pile villages.]\r\n\r\nSuch pile dwellings, answering the primary need of protection, have had\r\nwide distribution, especially in the Tropics, and persist into our own\r\ntimes among retarded peoples living in small, isolated groups too weak\r\nfor effective defence. They were numerous in the lakes of Switzerland[580]\r\nand northern Italy down to the first century of our era, and existed\r\nlater in slightly modified form in Ireland, Scotland, England and\r\nsouthern Wales.[581] In ancient Ireland they were constructed on\r\nartificial islands, raised in shallow spots of lakes or morasses by\r\nmeans of fascines weighted down with gravel and clay, and moored to the\r\nbottom by stakes driven through the mass. Such groups of dwellings were\r\ncalled _Crannogs_; they existed in Ireland from the earliest historical\r\nperiod and continued in use down to the time of Queen Elizabeth. In the\r\nturbulent twelfth century, the warring lords of the soil adopted them as\r\nplaces of refuge and residence.[582] Herodotus describes a pile village of\r\nthe ancient Thracians in Lake Prasias near the Hellespont, built quite\r\nafter the Swiss type, with trap doors in the floor for fishing or\r\nthrowing out refuse. Its inhabitants escaped conquest by the Persians\r\nunder King Darius, and avoided the fate of their fellow tribesmen on\r\nland, who were subdued and removed as colonists to Asia.[583]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Present distribution.]\r\n\r\nAmong Europeans such pile villages belong to primitive stages of\r\ndevelopment, chiefly to the Stone, Bronze, and early Iron Ages. They are\r\nwidely distributed in modern times among retarded peoples, who in this\r\nway seek compensation for their social and economic weakness. In South\r\nAmerica, the small timid tribe of the native Warraus till quite recently\r\nbuilt their dwellings on platforms over the water in the river network\r\nof the Orinoco delta and along the swamp coast as far as the Essequibo.\r\nThese pile villages, \"_fondata sopra l'acqua come Venezia_,\" as\r\nVespuccius says, suggested to him the name of Venezuela or little Venice\r\nfor this coast.[584] A pile village in Jull Lake, a lacustrine expansion\r\nin a tributary of the upper Salwin River, is inhabited by the Inthas,\r\napparently an alien colony in Burma. They have added a detail in their\r\nfloating gardens, rafts covered with soil, on which they raise tomatoes,\r\nwatermelons and gourds.[585]\r\n\r\nIn little Lake Mohrya, located near the upper Lualaba River, a southern\r\nheadstream of the Congo, Cameron found numerous pile dwellings, whose\r\nowners moved about in dug-out canoes and cultivated fields on land,[586]\r\nas did their Swiss confrères of twenty centuries ago. Livingstone, in\r\ndescending from Lake Nyassa by the Shire River, found in the lakelet of\r\nPamalombe, into which the stream widened, similar water huts inhabited\r\nby a number of Manganja families, who had been driven from their homes\r\nby slave raiders. The slender reeds of the papyrus thicket, lining the\r\nshore in a broad band, served as piles, number compensating for the lack\r\nof strength; the reeds, bent downward and fastened together into a mat,\r\ndid indeed support their light dwellings, but heaved like thin ice when\r\nthe savages moved from hut to hut. The dense forest of papyrus left\r\nstanding between village and shore effectually screened their retreat,\r\nand the abundant fish in the lake provided them with food.[587]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Malayan pile dwellings.]\r\n\r\nIn the vast island world of Indonesia, where constant contact with the\r\nsea has bred the amphibian Malay race, we are not surprised to find that\r\nthe typical Malay house is built on piles above the water; and that when\r\nthe coast Malay is driven inland by new-comers of his own stock and\r\nforced to abandon his favorite occupations of trade, piracy and fishing,\r\nhe takes to agriculture but still retains his sea-born architecture and\r\nraises his hut on poles above the ground, beyond the reach of an enemy's\r\nspear-thrust. The Moro Samal Laut of the southern Sulu Archipelago avoid\r\nthe large volcanic islands of the group, and place their big villages\r\nover the sea on low coral reefs. The sandy beaches of the shore hold\r\ntheir coco-palms, whose nuts by their milk eke out the scanty supply of\r\ndrinking water, and whose fronds shade the tombs of the dead.[588] The\r\nsea-faring Malays of the Sunda Islands, in thickly populated points of\r\nthe coast, often dwell in permanently inhabited rafts moored near the\r\npile dwellings. Palembang on the lower swampy course of the River Musi\r\nhas a floating suburb of this sort. It is called the \"Venice of\r\nSumatra,\" just as Banjarmasin, a vast complex of pile and raft\r\ndwellings, is called the \"Venice of Borneo,\" and Brunei to the north is\r\nthe \"Venice of the East.\"[589] Both these towns are the chief commercial\r\ncenters of their respective islands. The little town of Kilwaru,\r\nsituated on a sandbank off the eastern end of Ceram, seems to float on\r\nthe sea, so completely has it surrounded and enveloped with pile-built\r\nhouses the few acres of dry land which form its nucleus. It is a place\r\nof busy traffic, the emporium for commerce between the Malay Archipelago\r\nand New Guinea.[590]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: In Melanesia.]\r\n\r\nFarther east in Melanesia, whose coast regions are more or less\r\npermeated by Malayan stock and influences, pile dwellings, both over\r\nwater and on land form a characteristic feature of the scenery. The\r\nvillage of Sowek in Geelvink Bay, on the northern coast of Dutch New\r\nGuinea, consists of thirty houses raised on piles above the water,\r\nconnected with each other by tree trunks but having only boat connection\r\nwith the shore. Similar villages are found hovering over the lapping\r\nwaves of Humboldt Bay, all of them recalling with surprising fidelity\r\nthe prehistoric lake-dwellings of Switzerland.[591] The Papuan part of\r\nPort Moresby, on the southern coast of British New Guinea, covers the\r\nwhole water-front of the town with pile dwellings. In the vicinity are\r\nsimilar native pile villages, such as Tanobada, Hanuabada, Elevara and\r\nHula, the latter consisting of pile dwellings scattered about over the\r\nwater in a circuit of several miles and containing about a thousand\r\ninhabitants. Here, too, the motive is protection against the attacks of\r\ninland mountain tribes, with whom the coast people are in constant\r\nwar.[592]\r\n\r\nThe Malay fisherman, trader and pirate, with the love of the sea in his\r\nblood, by these pile dwellings combines security from his foe and\r\nproximity to his familiar field of activity. The same objects are\r\nachieved by white traders on the west coast of Africa by setting up\r\ntheir dwellings and warehouses on the old hulks of dismasted vessels,\r\nwhich are anchored for this purpose in the river mouths. They afford\r\nsome protection against both fever and hostile native, and at the same\r\ntime occupy the natural focus of local trade seeking foreign exchanges.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: River dwellers in populous lands.]\r\n\r\nWhen advancing civilization has eliminated the need for this form of\r\nprotection, water-dwellers may survive or reappear in old and\r\nrelatively over-populated countries, as we find them universally on the\r\nrivers of China and less often in Farther India. Here they present the\r\nphenomenon of human life overflowing from the land to the streams of the\r\ncountry; because these, as highways of commerce, afford a means of\r\nlivelihood, even apart from the food supply in their fish, and offer an\r\nunclaimed bit of the earth's surface for a floating home. Canton has\r\n250,000 inhabitants living on boats and rafts moored in the river, and\r\nfinding occupation in the vast inland navigation of the Empire, or in\r\nthe trade which it brings to this port of the Si-kiang. Some of the\r\nboats accommodate large families, together with modest poultry farms,\r\ncrowded together under their low bamboo sheds. Others are handsome\r\nwooden residences ornamented with plants, and yet others are pleasure\r\nresorts with their professional singing girls.[593] In the lakes and\r\nswamp-bordered rivers of southern Shantung, a considerable fishing\r\npopulation is found living in boats, while the land shows few\r\ninhabitants. This population enjoys freedom from taxation and\r\nunrestricted use of the rivers and fisheries. To vary their scant and\r\nmonotonous diet, they construct floating gardens on rafts of bamboo\r\ncovered with earth, on which they plant onions and garlic and which they\r\ntow behind their boats. They also raise hundreds of ducks, which are\r\ntrained to go into the water to feed and return at a signal,[594] thus\r\nexpanding the resources of their river life. Bangkok has all its\r\nbusiness district afloat on the Menam River--shops, lumber yards,\r\neating-houses and merchants' dwellings. Even the street vendor's cart is\r\na small boat, paddled in and out among the larger junks.[595]\r\n\r\nA far more modern type of river-dwellers is found in the \"shanty-boat\"\r\npeople of the western rivers of the United States. They are the gypsies\r\nof our streams, nomads who float downstream with the current, tying up\r\nat intervals along the bank of some wooded island or city waterfront,\r\nthen paying a tug to draw their house-boat upstream. The river furnishes\r\nthem with fish for their table and driftwood for their cooking-stove,\r\nand above all is the highway for the gratification of their nomad\r\ninstincts. There is no question here of trade and overpopulation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reclamation of land from the sea.]\r\n\r\nPile dwellings and house-boats are a paltry form of encroachment upon\r\nthe water in comparison with that extensive reclamation of river swamps\r\nand coastal marshes which in certain parts of the world has so increased\r\nthe area available for human habitation. The water which is a necessity\r\nto man may become his enemy unless it is controlled. The alluvium which\r\na river deposits in its flood-plain, whether in some flat stretch of its\r\nmiddle course or near the retarding level of the sea, attracts\r\nsettlement because of its fertility and proximity to a natural highway;\r\nbut it must be protected by dikes against the very element which created\r\nit. Such deposits are most extensive on low coasts at or near the\r\nriver's mouth, just where the junction of an inland and oceanic waterway\r\noffers the best conditions for commerce. Here then is a location\r\ndestined to attract and support a large population, for which place can\r\nbe made only by steady encroachment upon the water of both river and\r\nsea. Diking is necessitated not only by the demand for more land for the\r\ngrowing population, but also by the constant silting up of the drainage\r\noutfalls, which increases the danger of inundation while at the same\r\ntime contributing to the upbuilding of the land. Conditions here\r\ninstitute an incessant struggle between man and nature;[596] but the\r\nrewards of victory are too great to count the cost. The construction of\r\nsea-walls, embankment of rivers, reclamation of marshes, the cutting of\r\ncanals for drains and passways in a water-soaked land, the conversion of\r\nlakes into meadow, the rectification of tortuous streams for the greater\r\neconomy of this silt-made soil, all together constitute the greatest\r\ngeographical transformation that man has brought about on the earth's\r\nsurface.[597]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The struggle with the water.]\r\n\r\nThough the North Sea lowland of Europe has suffered from the serious\r\nencroachment of the sea from the thirteenth to the sixteenth century,\r\nwhen the Zuyder Zee, the Dollart and Jade Bay were formed, nevertheless\r\nthe counter encroachment of the land upon the water, accomplished\r\nthrough the energy and intelligence of the inhabitants, has more than\r\nmade good the loss. Between the Elbe and Scheldt more than 2,000 square\r\nmiles (5,000 square kilometers) have been reclaimed from river and sea\r\nin the past three hundred years. Holland's success in draining her large\r\ninland waters, like the Haarlem Meer (70 square miles or 180 square\r\nkilometers) and the Lake of Ij, has inspired an attempt to recover 800\r\nsquare miles (2,050 square kilometers) of fertile soil from the borders\r\nof the Zuyder Zee and reduce that basin to nearly one-third of its\r\npresent size.[598] One-fourth of the Netherlands lies below the average\r\nof high tides, and in 1844 necessitated 9,000 windmills to pump the\r\nwaste water into the drainage canals.[599]\r\n\r\nThe Netherlands, with all its external features of man's war against the\r\nwater, has its smaller counterpart in the 1,200 square miles of\r\nreclaimed soil about the head of the Wash, which constitute the Fenland\r\nof England. Here too are successive lines of sea-wall, the earliest of\r\nthem attributed to the Romans, straightened and embanked rivers,\r\ndrainage canals, windmills and steam pumps, dikes serving as roads,\r\nlines of willows and low moist pastures dotted with grazing cattle. No\r\nfeature of the Netherlands is omitted. The low southern part of\r\nLincolnshire is even called Holland, and Dutch prisoners from a naval\r\nbattle of 1652 were employed there on the work of reclamation, which was\r\nbegun on a large scale about this time.[600] In the medieval period, the\r\nincrease of population necessitated measures to improve the drainage and\r\nextend the acreage; but there was little co-operation among the land\r\nowners, and the maintenance of river dikes and sea-walls was neglected,\r\ntill a succession of disasters from flooding streams and invading tides\r\nin the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries led to severe measures\r\nagainst defaulters. One culprit was placed alive in a breach which his\r\nown neglect or criminal cutting had caused, and was built in, by way of\r\neducating the Fenlanders to a sense of common responsibility.[601]\r\n\r\nThe fight against the water on the coast begins later than that against\r\nrivers and swamps in the interior of the land; it demands greater\r\nenterprise and courage, because it combats two enemies instead of one;\r\nbut its rewards are correspondingly greater. The Netherlands by their\r\nstruggle have acquired not only territory for an additional half\r\nmillion population, but have secured to themselves a strategic position\r\nin the maritime trade of the world.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mound villages in river flood-plains.]\r\n\r\nThe abundant fertility of river flood-plains inevitably attracts\r\npopulation and necessitates some kind of artificial protection against\r\ninundation. The most primitive form of this protection is obvious and\r\nwidespread, restricted in neither locality nor race. When the flood\r\nseason converts the flat plain of the White Nile below Gondokora (7° N.\r\nLat.) into an extensive marsh, countless hills of the white ant emerge\r\nover the waters. During the dry season, the ants build up their hills to\r\nabout ten feet, and then live in safety in the upper section during the\r\nflood. They greatly surpass in intelligence and constructive ability the\r\nhuman occupants of the valley, the low and wretched Kytch tribe of the\r\nDinka Negroes, who like the ants are attracted by the natural vegetation\r\nof the flood-plain, and who use the ant-hills as refuge stations for\r\nthemselves and their cattle during the flood.[602] Elsewhere in Africa\r\nthe natives are more intelligent, for flood-plain villages built on\r\nartificial mounds have existed from the earliest times. Diodorus Siculus\r\ntells us that those of ancient Egypt, when the Nile was high, looked\r\nlike the Cyclades Islands.[603] Similar ones are constructed by the\r\nBarotse tribe on the upper Zambesi.[604] The Niger River, rising in the\r\nFoota Jallon and Kong Mountains which form a region of heavy rainfall\r\nfrom February to July, inundates a plain of several thousand square\r\nmiles for a distance of 250 miles above Timbuctoo. Here again the\r\nvillages of the agricultural Song-hoi duplicate those of Egypt, built on\r\nthe same clay mounds, wreathed in the same feathery palms, and\r\ncommunicating with one another only by small boats.[605] The same picture\r\nis presented by the Yangtze Kiang plain during the summer overflow--low\r\nartificial hills rising from the expanse of muddy water and topped with\r\ntrees and villages, while sampans moored to their base show the means of\r\ncommunication.[606] In the broad flood-plain of the lower Mississippi\r\nRiver, the chronicles of the De Soto expedition state that the Indian\r\nvillages visited stood \"on mounds made by art.\" The Yazoo River Indians,\r\nat the commencement of the eighteenth century, had their cabins\r\ndispersed over the low deltaic land on earthen mounds made by their own\r\nhands. There is also strong evidence that some of the works of the\r\nMound-builders in the \"bottoms\" of the middle and lower Mississippi\r\nserved as protected sites for the dwellings of their chiefs.[607]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Diking of rivers.]\r\n\r\nSuch meager provisions against inundation suffice for the sparse\r\npopulation characterizing the lower stages of civilization, but they\r\nmust be supplemented for the increasing density of higher stages by the\r\nembankment of the stream, to protect also the adjacent fields. Hence the\r\nprocess of confining rivers within dikes goes back into gray antiquity.\r\nThose of the Po and its tributaries were begun before the political\r\nhistory of the Lombardy plains commenced. Strabo mentions the canals and\r\ndikes of Venetia, whereby a part of the country was drained and rendered\r\ntillable.[608] The main Po has been embanked for centuries as far up as\r\nCremona, a distance of 600 miles, and the Adige to Verona.[609] But the\r\nmost gigantic dike system in the world is that of the Hoangho, by which\r\na territory the size of England is won from the water for\r\ncultivation.[610] The cost of protecting the far spread crops against the\r\nautumn floods has been a large annual expenditure and unceasing\r\nwatchfulness; and this the Chinese have paid for two thousand years, but\r\nhave not always purchased immunity. Year by year the Yellow River mounts\r\nhigher and higher on its silted bed above the surrounding lowlands,\r\nincreasing the strain on the banks and the area of destruction, when its\r\nfury is uncaged. The flood of 1887 covered an area estimated at 50,000\r\nsquare miles, wiped out of existence a million people, and left a\r\ngreater number a prey to famine.[611] So the fertile Chengtu plain of the\r\nMin River, supporting four millions of people on its 2,500 square miles\r\nof area, owes its prosperity to the embanking and irrigating works of\r\nthe engineer heroes, Li Ping and his son, who lived before the Christian\r\nera. On the temple in their honor in the city of Kuan Hsien is Li Ping's\r\nmotto, incised in gold: \"Dig the bed deep, keep the banks low.\" For\r\ntwenty-one centuries these instructions have been carried out. The stone\r\ndikes are kept low to permit a judicious amount of flooding for\r\nfertilization, and every year five to six feet of silt are removed from\r\nthe artificial channel of the Min. To this work the whole population of\r\nthe Chengtu plain contributes.[612] [See map page 8.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Social gain by control of the water.]\r\n\r\nIn such organized struggles to reduce the domain of the water and extend\r\nthat of the dry land, the material gain is not all: more significant by\r\nfar is the power to co-operate that is developed in a people by a\r\nprolonged war against overwhelming sea or river. A common natural\r\ndanger, constantly and even regularly recurring, necessitates for its\r\nresistance a strong and sustained union, that draws men out of the\r\nbarren individualism of a primitive people, and forces them without halt\r\nalong the path of civilization. It brings a realizing sense of the\r\nsuperiority of common interests over individual preferences, strengthens\r\nthe national bond, and encourages voluntary subservience to law.\r\n\r\nThis is the social or political gain; but this is not all. The danger\r\nemanating from natural phenomena has its discoverable laws, and\r\ntherefore leads to a first empirical study of winds, currents, seasonal\r\nrainfall and the whole science of hydraulics. With deep national\r\ninsight, the Greeks embodied in their mythology the story of Perseus and\r\nhis destruction of the sea monster who ravaged the coast, and Hercules'\r\nkilling of the many-headed serpent who issued from the Lernean Marshes\r\nto lay waste the country of Argos. Even so early a writer as Strabo\r\nstates that yet earlier authorities interpreted Hercules' victory over\r\nthe river god of the Achelous as the embankment of that stream and the\r\ndraining of its inundated delta tract by the national benefactor.[613] So\r\nthe Chinese, whose land abounds in swamps and devastating rivers, have a\r\nlong list of engineer heroes who embanked and drained for the salvation\r\nand benefit of mankind. It is highly probable that the communal work\r\ninvolved in the construction of dikes and canals for the control of the\r\nHoangho floods cemented the Chinese nationality of that vast lowland\r\nplain, and supplied the cohesive force that developed here at a very\r\nremote period a regularly organized state and an advancing civilization.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Control of water as factor in early civilizations of arid\r\nlands.]\r\n\r\nThe history of Egypt shows a similar effect of the yearly inundation of\r\nthe Nile Valley. Here, as in all rainless countries where irrigation\r\nmust be practiced, the water becomes a potent factor of political union\r\nand civilization. Its scarcity necessitates common effort in the\r\nconstruction and maintenance of irrigation works, and a central control\r\nto secure fair distribution of the water to the fields of the\r\ninhabitants. A stimulus to progress is found in the presence of a\r\nproblem, perennial as the yearly threatenings of the Hoangho, which\r\ndemands the application of human intelligence and concerted labor for\r\nits solution. Additional arable land for the growing population can be\r\nsecured only by the wider distribution of the fructifying water; this in\r\nturn depends upon corporate effort wisely directed and ably controlled.\r\nEvery lapse in governmental efficiency means an encroachment of the\r\ndesert upon the alluvial fields and finally to the river bank, as to-day\r\nin Mesopotamia.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the earliest civilizations have originated in the\r\nsub-tropical rainless districts of the world has been ascribed solely to\r\nthe regular and abundant returns to tillage under irrigation, as opposed\r\nto the uncertain crops under variable meteorological conditions; to the\r\nconsequent accumulation of wealth, and the emancipation of man for other\r\nand higher activities, which follows his escape from the agricultural\r\nvicissitudes of an uncertain climate. When Draper says: \"Civilization\r\ndepends on climate and agriculture,\" and \"the civilization of Egypt\r\ndepended for its commencement on the sameness and stability of the\r\nAfrican climate,\" and again, \"agriculture is certain in Egypt and there\r\nman first became civilized,\"[614] he seizes upon the conspicuous fact of\r\na stable food supply as the basis of progress, failing to detect those\r\npotent underlying social effects of the inundations--social and\r\npolitical union to secure the most effective distribution of the Nile's\r\nblessings and to augment by human devices the area accessible to them,\r\nthe development of an intelligent water economy, which ultimately\r\nproduced a long series of intellectual achievements.[615]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cultural areas in primitive America.]\r\n\r\nThis unifying and stimulating national task of utilizing and\r\ncontrolling the water was the same task which in various forms prompted\r\nthe early civilization of the Hoangho and Yangtze basins, India,\r\nMesopotamia, Persia, Peru, Mexico, and that impressive region of\r\nprehistoric irrigation canals found in the Salt, Gila River, and upper\r\nRio Grande valleys.[616] Here the arid plateaus of the Cordilleras\r\nbetween the Pueblo district and Central America had no forests in which\r\ngame might be found; so that the Indian hunter had to turn to\r\nagriculture and a sedentary life beside his narrow irrigated fields.\r\nHere native civilization reached its highest grade in North America.\r\nHere desert agriculture achieved something more than a reliable food\r\nsupply. It laid the foundation of the first steady integration of\r\nwandering Indian hordes into a stable, permanently organized society.\r\nElsewhere throughout the North American continent, we see only shifting\r\ngroups of hunter and fisher folk, practising here and there a half\r\nnomadic agriculture to supplement the chase.\r\n\r\nThe primitive American civilization that arose among the Pueblo Indians\r\nof New Mexico and Arizona, the only strictly sedentary tribes relying\r\nexclusively on agriculture north of the Mexican plateau, was primarily a\r\nresult of the pressure put upon these people by a restricted water\r\nsupply.[617] Though chiefly offshoots of the wild Indians of the northern\r\nplains, they have been markedly differentiated from their wandering\r\nShoshone and Kiowa kindred by local environment.[618] Scarcity of water\r\nin those arid highlands and paucity of arable land forced them to a\r\ncarefully organized community life, made them invest their labor in\r\nirrigation ditches, terraced gardens and walled orchards, whereby they\r\nwere as firmly rooted in their scant but fertile fields as were their\r\ncotton plants and melon vines;[619] while the towering mesas protected\r\ntheir homes against marauding Ute, Navajo and Apache.[620] This thread of\r\na deep underlying connection between civilization and the control of\r\nwater can be traced through all prehistoric America, as well as through\r\nthe earliest cultural achievements in North Africa and Asia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Economy of the water: fisheries.]\r\n\r\nThe economy of the water is not confined to its artificial distribution\r\nover arid fields, but includes also the exploitation of the mineral and\r\nanimal resources of the vast world of waters, whether the production of\r\nsalt from the sea, salt lakes and brine springs, the cultivation of\r\noyster beds, or the whole range of pelagic fisheries. The animal life of\r\nthe water is important to man owing not only to its great abundance, but\r\nalso to its distribution over the coldest regions of the globe. It\r\nfurnishes the chief food supply of polar and sub-polar peoples, and\r\ntherefore is accountable for the far-northern expansion of the habitable\r\nworld. Even the reindeer tribes of Arctic Eurasia could hardly subsist\r\nwithout the sea food they get by barter from the fishermen of the coast.\r\nNorway, where civilization has achieved its utmost in exploiting the\r\nlimited means of subsistence, shows a steady increase from south to\r\nnorth in the proportion of the population dependent upon the harvest of\r\nthe deep. Thus the fisheries engross 44 per cent. of the rural\r\npopulation in Nordland province, which is bisected by the Arctic Circle;\r\nover 50 per cent. in Tromso, and about 70 per cent. in Finmarken. If the\r\ntowns also be included, the percentages rise, because here fishing\r\ninterests are especially prominent.[621] Proximity to the generous larder\r\nof the ocean has determined the selection of village sites, as we have\r\nseen among the coast Indians of British Columbia and southern Alaska,\r\namong all the Eskimo, and numerous other peoples of Arctic lands. [See\r\nmap page 153.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fisheries as factors in maritime expansion.]\r\n\r\nNot only in polar but also in temperate regions, the presence of\r\nabundant fishing grounds draws the people of the nearest coast to their\r\nwholesale exploitation, especially if the land resources are scant.\r\nFisheries then become the starting point or permanent basis of a\r\nsubsequent wide maritime development, by expanding the geographical\r\nhorizon. It was the search for the purple-yielding _murex_ that first\r\nfamiliarized the Phoenicians with the commercial and colonial\r\npossibilities of the eastern Mediterranean coasts.[622] The royal dye of\r\nthis marine product has through all the ages seemed to color with\r\nsumptuous magnificence the sordid dealings of those Tyrian traders, and\r\nconstituted them an aristocracy of merchants. The shoals of tunny fish,\r\narriving every spring in the Bosporus, from the north, drew the early\r\nGreeks and Phoenicians after them into the cold and misty Euxine, and\r\nfurnished the original impulse to both these peoples for the\r\nestablishment of fishing and trading stations on its uncongenial\r\nshores.[623] To the fisheries of the Baltic and especially to the summer\r\ncatch of the migratory herring, which in vast numbers visited the shores\r\nof Pomerania and southern Sweden to spawn, the Hanse Towns of Germany\r\nowed much of their prosperity. Salt herring, even in the twelfth\r\ncentury, was the chief single article of their exchanges with Catholic\r\nEurope, which made a strong demand for the fish, owing to the numerous\r\nfast days. When, in 1425, by one of those unexplained vagaries of animal\r\nlife, the herring abandoned the Baltic and selected the North Sea for\r\nits summer destination, a new support was given to the wealth of the\r\nNetherlands.[624] There is a considerable amount of truth in the saying\r\nthat Amsterdam was built on herrings. New England, with an unproductive\r\nsoil at home, but near by in the sea a long line of piscine feeding\r\ngrounds in the submarine banks stretching from Cape Cod to Cape Race and\r\nbeyond, found her fisheries the starting point and base of her long\r\nround of exchanges, a constant factor in her commercial and industrial\r\nevolution.[625]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fisheries as nurseries of seamen.]\r\n\r\nFisheries have always been the nurseries of seamen, and hence have been\r\nencouraged and protected by governments as providing an important\r\nelement of national strength. The Newfoundland Banks were the training\r\nschool which supplied the merchant marine and later the Revolutionary\r\nnavy of colonial New England;[626] ever since the establishment of the\r\nRepublic, they have been forced into prominence in our international\r\nnegotiations with the United Kingdom, with the object of securing\r\nspecial privileges, because the government has recognized them as a\r\nfactor in the American navy. The causal connection between fisheries and\r\nnaval efficiency was recognized in England in the early years of\r\nElizabeth's reign, by an act aiming to encourage fisheries by the\r\nremission of custom duties to native fishermen, by the imposition of a\r\nhigh tariff on the importation of foreign fish in foreign vessels, and\r\nfinally by a legislative enforcement of fasts to increase the demand for\r\nfish, although any belief in the religious efficacy of fasts was frankly\r\ndisclaimed. Thus an artificial demand for fish was created, with the\r\nresult that a report on the success of the Fishery Acts stated that a\r\nthousand additional men had been attracted to the fishing trade, and\r\nwere consequently \"ready to serve in Her Majesty's ships.\"[627]\r\n\r\nThe fishing of the North Sea, especially on the Dogger Bank, is\r\nparticipated in by all the bordering countries, England, the\r\nNetherlands, Germany and Belgium; and is valued equally on account of\r\nthe food supply which it yields and as a school of seamen.[628] The\r\nPomors or \"coasters\" of Arctic Russia, who dwell along the shores of the\r\nWhite Sea and live wholly by fisheries, have all their taxes remitted\r\nand receive free wood from the crown forests for the construction of\r\ntheir ships, on the condition that they serve on call in the imperial\r\nnavy.[629] The history of Japan affords the most striking illustration of\r\nthe power of fisheries alone to maintain maritime efficiency; for when\r\nby the seclusion act of 1624 all merchant vessels were destroyed, the\r\nmarine restricted to small fishing and coasting vessels, and intercourse\r\nconfined to Japan's narrow island world, the fisheries nevertheless kept\r\nalive that intimacy with the sea and preserved the nautical efficiency\r\nthat was destined to be a decisive factor in the development of awakened\r\nJapan.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Anthropo-geographic importance of navigation.]\r\n\r\nThe resources of the sea first tempted man to trust himself to its\r\ndangerous surface; but their rewards were slight in comparison with the\r\nwealth of experiences and influences to which he fell heir, after he\r\nlearned to convert the barrier of the untrod waste into a highway for\r\nhis sail-borne keel. It is therefore true, as many anthropologists\r\nmaintain, that after the discovery of fire the next most important step\r\nin the progress of the human race was the invention of the boat. No\r\nother has had such far-reaching results. Since water covers\r\nthree-fourths of the earth's surface and permits the land-masses to rise\r\nonly as islands here and there, it presents to man for his nautical\r\nventures three times the area that he commands for his terrestrial\r\nhabitat. On every side, the break of the waves and the swell of the\r\ntides block his wanderings, unless he has learned to make the water\r\ncarry him to his distant goal. Spacially, therefore, the problem and the\r\ntask of navigation is the most widespread and persistent in the history\r\nof mankind. The numerous coaling-stations which England has scattered\r\nover the world are mute witnesses to this spacial supremacy of the\r\nwater, to the length of ocean voyages, and the power of the ocean to\r\ndivide and unite. But had the proportion of land and water been\r\nreversed, the world would have been poorer, deprived of all these\r\npossibilities of segregation and differentiation, of stimulus to\r\nexchange and far-reaching intercourse, and of ingenious inventions which\r\nthe isolating ocean has caused. Without this ramifying barrier between\r\nthe different branches of the human family, these would have resembled\r\neach other more closely, but at the cost of development. The mere\r\nmultiplicity of races and sub-races has sharpened the struggle for\r\nexistence and endowed the survivors with higher qualities. But it was\r\nnavigation that released primitive man from the seclusion of his own\r\nisland or continent, stimulated and facilitated the intercourse of\r\npeoples, and enabled the human race to establish itself in every\r\nhabitable part of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n[579] Census of the Philippine Islands, Vol. I, pp. 465, 563-567, 573.\r\nWashington, 1905.\r\n\r\n[580] Sir John Lubbock, Prehistoric Times, pp. 173-223.

They are either part of\r\nthe general water envelope of the earth, extensions of seas and\r\nestuaries back into the up-hill reaches of the land, feeders of the\r\nocean, roots which it spreads out over the surface of the continents,\r\nnot only to gather its nourishment from ultimate sources in spring and\r\nglacier, but also to bring down to the coast the land-born products of\r\nthe interior to feed a sea-born commerce; or rivers are one of the land\r\nforms, merely water filling valley channels, serving to drain the fields\r\nand turn the mills of men. In the first aspect their historical\r\nimportance has been both akin and linked to that of the ocean, despite\r\nthe freshness and smaller volume of their waters and the unvarying\r\ndirection of their currents. The ocean draws them and their trade to its\r\nvast basin by the force of gravity. It unites with its own the history\r\nof every log-stream in Laurentian or Himalayan forest, as it formerly\r\nlinked the beaver-dammed brooks of wintry Canada with the current of\r\ntrade following the Gulf Stream to Europe.\r\n\r\nWhere sea and river meet, Nature draws no sharp dividing line. Here the\r\nindeterminate boundary zone is conspicuous. The fresh water stream\r\nmerges into brackish estuary, estuary into saltier inlet and inlet into\r\nbriny ocean. Closely confined sea basins like the Black and Baltic,\r\nlocated in cool regions of slight evaporation and fed from a large\r\ncatchment basin, approach in their reduced salinity the fresh water\r\nlakes and coastal lagoons in which rivers stretch out to rest on their\r\nway to the ocean. The muddy current of the Yangtze Kiang colors the\r\nYellow Sea, and warns incoming Chinese junks of the proximity of land\r\nmany hours before the low-lying shores can be discerned.[630] Columbus,\r\nsailing along the Caribbean coast of South America off the Orinoco\r\nmouth, found the ocean waters brackish and surmised the presence of a\r\nlarge river and therefore a large continent on his left.[631]\r\n\r\nThe transitional form between stream and pelagic inlet found in every\r\nriver mouth is emphasized where strong tidal currents carry the sea far\r\ninto these channels of the land. The tides move up the St. Lawrence\r\nRiver 430 miles (700 kilometers) or half way between Montreal and\r\nQuebec, and up the Amazon 600 miles (1,000 kilometers). Owing to their\r\nresemblance to pelagic channels, the estuaries of the American rivers\r\nwith their salty tide were repeatedly mistaken, in the period of\r\ndiscoveries, for the Northwest Passage to the Pacific. Newport in 1608\r\nexplored the broad sluggish course of the James River in his search for\r\na western ocean. Henry Hudson ascended the Hudson River almost as far as\r\nAlbany, before he discovered that this was no maritime pathway, like the\r\nBosporus or Dardanelles, leading to an ulterior sea. The long tidal\r\ncourse of the St. Lawrence westward into the heart of the continent fed\r\nLa Salle's dream of finding here a water route to the Pacific, and fixed\r\nhis village of \"La Chine\" above the rapids at Montreal as a signpost\r\npointing the way to the Indies and Cathay. In the same way a tidal river\r\nat the head of Cook's Inlet on the Alaskan coast was mistaken for a\r\nNortheast Passage, not by Captain Cook but by his fellow officers, on\r\nhis Pacific voyage of 1776-1780; and it was followed for several days\r\nbefore its character as a river was established.[632]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sea navigation merges into river navigation.]\r\n\r\nRivers have always been the great intermediaries between land and sea,\r\nfor in the ocean all find their common destination. Until the\r\nconstruction of giant steamers in recent years, sea navigation has\r\nalways passed without break into river navigation. Sailing vessels are\r\ncarried by the trade wind 600 miles up the Orinoco to San Fernando.\r\nAlexander's discovery of the Indus River led by almost inevitable\r\nsequence to the rediscovery of the Eastern sea route, which in turn ran\r\nfrom India through the Strait of Oman and the Persian Gulf up the\r\nnavigable course of the Euphrates to the elbow of the river at\r\nThapsacus. Enterprising sea folk have always used rivers as natural\r\ncontinuations of the marine highway into the land. The Humber estuary\r\nand its radiating group of streams led the invading Angles in the sixth\r\ncentury into the heart of Britain.[633] The long navigable courses of the\r\nrivers of France exposed that whole country to the depredations of the\r\npiratical Northmen in the ninth and tenth centuries. Up every river they\r\ncame, up the Scheldt into Flanders, the Seine to Paris and the Marne to\r\nMeaux; up the Loire to Orleans, the Garonne to Toulouse and the Rhone to\r\nValence.[634] So the Atlantic rivers of North America formed the lines of\r\nEuropean exploration and settlement. The St. Lawrence brought the French\r\nfrom the ocean into the Great Lakes basin, whose low, swampy watershed\r\nthey readily crossed in their light canoes to the tributaries of the\r\nMississippi; and scarcely had they reached the \"Father of Waters\" before\r\nthey were planting the flag of France on the Gulf of Mexico at its\r\nmouth. The Tupi Indians of South America, a genuine water-race, moved\r\nfrom their original home on the Paraguay headstream of the La Plata down\r\nto its mouth, then expanded northward along the coast of Brazil in their\r\nsmall canoes to the estuary of the Amazon, thence up its southern\r\ntributary, the Tapajos, and in smaller numbers up the main stream to the\r\nfoot of the Andes, where detached groups of the race are still found.[635]\r\nSo the migrations of the Carib river tribes led them from their native\r\nseats in eastern Brazil down the Xingu to the Amazon, thence out to sea\r\nand along the northern coast of South America, thence inland once more,\r\nup the Orinoco to the foot of the Andes, into the lagoon of Maracaibo\r\nand up the Magdalena. Meanwhile their settlements at the mouth of the\r\nOrinoco threw off spores of pirate colonies to the adjacent islands and\r\nfinally, in the time of Columbus, to Porto Rico and Haiti.[636] [See map\r\npage 101.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Historical importance of seas and oceans influenced by their\r\ndebouching streams.]\r\n\r\nSo intimate is this connection between marine and inland waterways, that\r\nthe historical and economic importance of seas and oceans is noticeably\r\ninfluenced by the size of their drainage basins and the navigability of\r\ntheir debouching rivers. This is especially true of enclosed seas. The\r\nonly historical importance attached to the Caspian's inland basin is\r\nthat inherent in the Volga's mighty stream. The Mediterranean has always\r\nsuffered from its paucity of long river highways to open for it a wide\r\nhinterland. This lack checked the spread of its cultural influences and\r\nfinally helped to arrest its historical development. If we compare the\r\nrecord of the Adriatic and the Black seas, the first a sharply walled\r\n_cul de sac_, the second a center of long radiating streams, sending out\r\nthe Danube to tap the back country of the Adriatic and the Dnieper to\r\ndraw on that of the Baltic, we find that the smaller sea has had a\r\nlimited range of influence, a concentrated brilliant history, precocious\r\nand short-lived as is that of all limited areas; that the Euxine has\r\nexercised more far-reaching influences, despite a slow and still\r\nunfinished development. The Black Sea rivers in ancient times opened\r\ntheir countries to such elements of Hellenic culture as might penetrate\r\nfrom the Greek trading colonies at their mouths, especially the Greek\r\nforms of Christianity. It was the Danube that in the fourth century\r\ncarried Arianism, born of the philosophic niceties of Greek thought, to\r\nthe barbarians of southern Germany, and made Unitarians of the\r\nBurgundians and Visigoths of southern Gaul.[637] The Dnieper carried the\r\nreligion of the Greek Church to the Russian princes at Kief, Smolensk,\r\nand Moscow. Owing to the southward course of its great rivers, Russia\r\nhas found the crux of her politics in the Black Sea, ever since the\r\ntenth century when the barbarians from Kiev first appeared before\r\nConstantinople. This sea has had for her a higher economic importance\r\nthan the Baltic, despite the latter's location near the cultural center\r\nof western Europe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Baltic and White Sea rivers.]\r\n\r\nIn other seas, too, rivers play the same part of extending their\r\ntributary areas and therefore enhancing their historical significance.\r\nThe disadvantages of the Baltic's smaller size and far-northern\r\nlocation, as compared with the Mediterranean, were largely compensated\r\nfor by the series of big streams draining into it from the south, and\r\nbringing out from a vast hinterland the bulky necessaries of life. Hence\r\nthe Hanseatic League of the Middle Ages, which had its origin among the\r\nsouthern coast towns of the Baltic from Lubeck to Riga, throve on the\r\ncombined trade of sea and river.[638] The mouths of the Scheldt, Rhine,\r\nWeser, Elbe and Thames long concentrated in themselves the economic,\r\ncultural and historical development of the North Sea basin. So the White\r\nSea, despite its sub-polar location, is valuable to Russia for two\r\nreasons; it affords a politically open port, and it receives the\r\nNorthern Dwina, which is navigable for river steamers from Archangel\r\nsouth to Vologda, a distance of six hundred miles, and carries the\r\nexport trade of a large territory.[639] Similarly in recent years, Bering\r\nSea has gained unwonted commercial activity because the Yukon River\r\nserves as a waterway 1,370 miles long to the Klondike gold fields.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Atlantic and Pacific rivers.]\r\n\r\nIf we compare the Atlantic and Pacific oceans in respect to their\r\nrivers, we find that the narrow Atlantic has a drainage basin of over\r\n19,000,000 square miles as opposed to the 8,660,000 square miles of\r\ndrainage area commanded by the vastly larger Pacific. The Pacific is for\r\nthe most part rimmed by mountains, discharging into the ocean only mad\r\ntorrents or rapid-broken streams. The Atlantic, bordered by gently\r\nsloping plains of wide extent, receives rivers that for the most part\r\npursue a long and leisurely course to the sea. Therefore, the commercial\r\nand cultural influences of the Atlantic extend from the Rockies and\r\nAndes almost to the heart of Russia, and by the Nile highway they even\r\ninvade the seclusion of Africa. Through the long reach of its rivers,\r\ntherefore, the Atlantic commands a land area twice as great as that of\r\nthe Pacific; and by reason of this fundamental geographic advantage, it\r\nwill retain the historical preëminence that it so early secured. The\r\ndevelopment of the World Ocean will mean the exploitation of the Pacific\r\ntrade from the basis of the Atlantic, the domination of the larger ocean\r\nby the historic peoples of the smaller, because these peoples have wider\r\nand more accessible lands as the base of their maritime operations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lack of coast articulations supplied by rivers.]\r\n\r\nThe geographic influence of abundant rivers navigable from the sea is\r\nclosely akin to that of highly articulated coasts. The effect of the\r\nHardanger or Sogne Fiord, admitting ocean steamers a hundred miles into\r\nthe interior of Norway, is similar to that of the Elbe and Weser\r\nestuaries, which admit the largest vessels sixty miles upstream to\r\nHamburg and Bremen. Since river inlets can, to a certain extent, supply\r\nthe place of marine inlets, from the standpoint of anthropo-geographic\r\ntheory and of human practice, a land dissected by navigable rivers can\r\nbe grouped with one dissected by arms of the sea. South America and\r\nAfrica are alike in the unbroken contour of their coasts, but strongly\r\ncontrasted in the character of their rivers. Hence the two continents\r\npresent the extremes of accessibility and inaccessibility. South\r\nAmerica, most richly endowed of all the continents with navigable\r\nstreams, receiving ocean vessels three thousand miles up the Amazon as\r\nfar as Tabatinga in Peru, and smaller steamers up the Orinoco to the\r\nspurs of the Andes, was known in its main features to explorers fifty\r\nyears after its discovery. Africa, historically the oldest of\r\ncontinents, but cursed with a mesa form which converts nearly every\r\nriver into a plunging torrent on its approach to the sea, kept its vast\r\ninterior till the last century wrapped in utmost gloom. China, amply\r\nsupplied with smaller littoral indentations but characterized by a\r\npaucity of larger inlets, finds compensation in the long navigable\r\ncourse of the Yangtze Kiang. This river extends the landward reach of\r\nthe Yellow Sea 630 miles inland to Hanchow, where ocean-going vessels\r\ntake on cargoes of tea and silk for Europe and America,[640] and pay for\r\nthem in Mexican dollars, the coin of the coast. Hence it is lined with\r\nfree ports all the way from Shanghai at its mouth to Ichang, a thousand\r\nmiles up its course.[641]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: River highways as basis of commercial preeminence.]\r\n\r\nNavigable rivers opening passages directly from the sea are obviously\r\nnature-made gates and paths into wholly new countries; but the\r\naccessibility with which they endow a land becomes later a permanent\r\nfactor in its cultural and economic development, a factor that remains\r\nconstantly though less conspicuously operative when railroads have done\r\ntheir utmost to supplant water transportation. The importance of inland\r\nwaterways for local and foreign trade and intercourse has everywhere\r\nbeen recognized. The peoples who have long maintained preëminence among\r\nthe commercial and maritime nations of the world have owed this in no\r\nsmall part to the command of these natural highways, which have served\r\nto give the broad land basis necessary for permanent commercial\r\nascendency. This has been the history of England, Holland, France and\r\nthe recent record of Germany. The medieval League of the Rhine Cities\r\nflourished by reason of the Rhone-Rhine highway across western Europe.\r\nThe Hanseatic League, from Bruges all the way east to Russian Novgorod,\r\nowed their brilliant commercial career, not only to the favorable\r\nmaritime field in the enclosed sea basins in front of them, but also to\r\nthe series of long navigable rivers behind them from the Scheldt to the\r\nNeva and Volchov. Wherefore we find the League, originally confined to\r\ncoast towns, drawing into the federation numerous cities located far up\r\nthese rivers, such as Ghent, Cologne, Magdeburg, Breslau, Cracow, Pskof\r\nand Novgorod.[642]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Importance of rivers in large countries.]\r\n\r\nIn countries of large area, where commerce and intercourse must cover\r\ngreat distances, these natural and therefore cheap highways assume\r\nparamount importance, especially in the forest and agricultural stages\r\nof development, when the products of the land are bulky in proportion to\r\ntheir value. Small countries with deeply indented coasts, like Greece,\r\nNorway, Scotland, New England, Chile, and Japan, can forego the\r\nadvantage of big river systems; but in Russia, Siberia, China, India,\r\nCanada, the United States, Venezuela, Brazil and Argentine, the history\r\nof the country, economic and political, is indissolubly connected with\r\nthat of its great rivers. The storm center of the French and English\r\nwars in America was located on the upper Hudson, because this stream\r\nenabled the English colonies to tap the fur trade of the Great Lakes,\r\nand because it commanded the Mohawk Valley, the easiest and most obvious\r\npath for expansion into the interior of the continent. The Spanish,\r\notherwise confining their activities in South America to the Caribbean\r\ndistrict and the civilized regions of the Andean highlands, established\r\nsettlements at the mouth of the La Plata River, because this stream\r\nafforded an approach from the Atlantic side toward the Potosi mines on\r\nthe Bolivian Plateau. The Yangtze Kiang, that great waterway leading\r\nfrom the sea across the breadth of China and the one valuable river\r\nadjunct of maritime trade in the whole Orient, was early appropriated by\r\nthe discerning English as the British \"sphere of influence.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rivers as highways of expansion.]\r\n\r\nNo other equally large area of the earth is so generously equipped by\r\nnature for the production and distribution of the articles of commerce\r\nas southern Canada and that part of the United States lying east of the\r\nRocky Mountains. The simple build of the North American continent,\r\nconsisting of a broad central trough between distant mountain ranges,\r\nand characterized by gentle slopes to the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of\r\nMexico, has generated great and small rivers with easy-going currents,\r\nthat everywhere opened up the land to explorer, trader and settler. The\r\nrate of expansion from the \"Europe-fronting shore\" of the continent was\r\neverywhere in direct proportion to the length of the rivers first\r\nappropriated by the colonists. North of Chesapeake Bay the lure to\r\nlandward advance was the fur trade. The Atlantic rivers of the coast\r\npre-empted by the English were cut short by the Appalachian wall. They\r\nopened up only restricted fur fields which were soon exhausted, so that\r\nthe migrant trapper was here early converted into the agricultural\r\nsettler, his shifting camp fire into the hearthstone of the farmhouse.\r\nExpansion was slow but solid. The relatively small area rendered\r\naccessible by their streams became compactly filled by the swelling tide\r\nof immigrants and the rapid natural increase of population. In sharp\r\ncontrast to this development, the long waterway of the St. Lawrence and\r\nthe Great Lakes leading to the still vaster river system of the\r\nMississippi betrayed the fur-trading French into excessive expansion,\r\nand enabled them to appropriate but not to hold a vast extent of\r\nterritory. A hundred years after the arrival of Champlain at Montreal,\r\nthey were planting their fur stations on Lake Superior and the\r\nMississippi, 1,400 miles (2,300 kilometers) back from the coast, at a\r\ntime when the English settlements had advanced little beyond tide-water.\r\nAnd when after 1770 the westward movement swept the backwoodsmen of the\r\nEnglish colonies over the Appalachian barrier to the Ohio, Cumberland\r\nand Tennessee, these long westward flowing streams carried them rapidly\r\non to the Mississippi, communicated the mobility and restlessness of\r\ntheir own currents to the eager pioneer, and their capacity to master\r\ngreat distances; so that in forty short years, by 1810, settlements were\r\ncreeping up the western tributaries of the Mississippi. The abundant\r\nwater communication in the Mississippi Valley, which even for present\r\nlarge river craft contains 15,410 miles of navigable streams and which\r\nhad therefore a far greater mileage in the day of canoe and flatboat,\r\nafforded outlet for bulky, backwoods produce to the sea at New Orleans.\r\nWhen the English acquired Canada in 1763, they straightway fell under\r\nthe sway of its harsh climate and long river systems, taking up the\r\nlife of the fur trader; they followed the now scarcer pelts from the\r\nstreams of Superior westward by Lake Winnipeg and along the path of the\r\nSaskatchewan River straight to the foot of the Rockies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Siberian rivers and Russian expansion.]\r\n\r\nRivers have played the same part in expediting Russian expansion across\r\nthe wide extent of Siberia. Here again a severe climate necessitated\r\nreliance on furs, the chief natural product of the country, as the basis\r\nof trade. These, as the outcome of savage economy, were gathered in from\r\nwide areas which only rivers could open up. Therefore, where the\r\nSiberian streams flatten out their upper courses east and west against\r\nthe northern face of the Asiatic plateau, with low watersheds between,\r\nthe Russian explorer and sable hunter struck their eastward water trail\r\ntoward the Pacific. The advance, which under Yermak crossed the Ural\r\nMountains in 1579, reached the Yenisei River in 1610 and planted there\r\nthe town of Turuchansk as a sort of milestone, almost on the Arctic\r\nCircle opposite the mouth of the Lower Tunguska, a long eastern\r\ntributary. Up this they passed to the Lena in 1627, thence to Bering Sea\r\nby the Kolima and Anadyr rivers, because these arctic fields yielded\r\nsable, beaver and fox skins in greatest quantity.[643] The Lena\r\nespecially, from its source down to its eastern elbow at Yakutsk, that\r\ngreat rendezvous of Siberian fur traders, was a highway for trapper and\r\nCossack tribute-gatherer.[644] From the sources of the Yenisei in Lake\r\nBaikal to the navigable course of the Amur was a short step, taken in\r\n1658, though the control of the river, which was claimed by China, was\r\nnot secured till two hundred years later.[645] [See map page 103.]\r\n\r\nAs the only highways in new countries, rivers constitute lines of least\r\nresistance for colonial peoples encroaching upon the territory of\r\ninferior races. They are therefore the geographic basis of those\r\nstreamers of settlement which we found making a fringe of civilization\r\nacross the boundary zone of savagery or barbarism on the typical\r\ncolonial frontier. Ethnic islands of the expanding people cluster along\r\nthem like iron filings on a magnetized wire. Therefore in all countries\r\nwhere navigable rivers have fixed the lines of expansion, as in the\r\nUnited States, the northern part of the Russian Empire, and the eastern\r\nor colonial border of Germany and Austria, there is a strong\r\nanthropo-geographic resemblance in the frontiers of successive decades\r\nor centuries. But in arid or semi-arid regions like South Africa, the\r\nwestern plains of North America, the steppes of Russian and Chinese\r\nTurkestan, the river highway _motif_ in expansion is lost in a variety\r\nof other geographic and geologic factors, though the water of the\r\nstreams still attracts trail and settlement.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Determinants of routes in arid or semi-arid lands.]\r\n\r\nA river like the Nile, lower Volga, Irtysh or Indus, rising in highlands\r\nof abundant rainfall but traversing an arid or desert land, acquires\r\nadded importance because it furnishes the sole means of water travel and\r\nof irrigation. The Nile has for ages constituted the main line of\r\nintercourse between the Mediterranean and Equatorial Africa. The Tigris,\r\nEuphrates, Indus, and the Niger where it makes its great northern bend\r\ninto the Sahara near Timbuctoo,[646] attest the value to local fertility\r\nand commerce inherent in these rivers of the deserts and steppes. Such\r\nrivers are always oasis-makers, whether on their way to the sea they\r\nperiodically cover a narrow flood-plain like that of the Nile, or one\r\nninety miles wide, like that of the Niger's inland delta above\r\nTimbuctoo;[647] or whether they emerge into a silent sea of sand, like\r\nthe Murghab of Russian Turkestan, which spreads itself out to water the\r\ngardens of Merv.\r\n\r\nEven where such rivers have a volume too scanty to float a raft, they\r\nyet point the highway, because they alone supply water for man and beast\r\nacross the desert tract. The Oxus and Sir Daria have from time\r\nimmemorial determined the great trade routes through Turkestan to\r\nCentral Asia. The Platte, Arkansas, Cimarron and Canadian rivers fixed\r\nthe course of our early western trails across the arid plains to the\r\nfoot of the Rockies; and beyond this barrier the California Trail\r\nfollowed the long-drawn oasis formed by the Humboldt River across the\r\nNevada Desert, the Gila River guided the first American fur-trapping\r\nexplorers across the burning deserts of Arizona to the Pacific, and the\r\nsuccession of water-holes in the dry bed of the Mohave River gave\r\ndirection to the Spanish Trail across the Mohave Desert towards Los\r\nAngeles. In the same way, Livingstone's route from the Orange River in\r\nSouth Africa to Lake Ngami, under the direction of native guides, ran\r\nalong the margin of the Kalahari Desert up the dry bed of the Mokoko\r\nRiver, which still retained an irregular succession of permanent\r\nwells.[648]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wadi routes in arid lands.]\r\n\r\nIn the trade-wind regions of the world, which are characterized by\r\nseasons of intense drought, we find rivers carrying a scant and variable\r\namount of water but an abundance of gravel and sand; they are known in\r\ndifferent localities as wadis, fiumares and arroyos. Their beds, dry for\r\nlong periods of the year, become natural roads, paved with the gravel\r\nwhich the stream regularly deposits in the wet season. Local travel in\r\nSicily, Italy[649] and other Mediterranean countries uses such natural\r\nroads extensively. Trade routes across the plateau of Judea and Samaria\r\nfollow the wadis, because these give the best gradient and the best\r\nfooting for the ascent.[650] Wadis also determine the line of caravan\r\nroutes across the highlands of the Sahara. In the desert of Southwest\r\nAfrica, the Khiuseb Is the first river north of the Orange to reach the\r\nAtlantic through the barrier dunes of the coast. Hence it has drawn to\r\nits valley the trade routes from a wide circle of inland points from\r\nOttawe to Windhoek and Rehobeth, and given added importance to the\r\nBritish coast of Walfish Bay, into which it debouches.[651] But just to the\r\nnorth, the broad dry bed of the Swakop offered a natural wagon route\r\ninto the interior, and has been utilized for the railroad of German\r\nSouthwest Africa.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Increasing historical importance from source to mouth.]\r\n\r\nThe historical importance of a river increases from its source toward\r\nits mouth. Its head springs, gushing from the ground, and the ramifying\r\nbrooks of its highland course yield a widely distributed water supply\r\nand thereby exercise a strong influence in locating the dwellings of\r\nmen; but they play no part in the great movements and larger activities\r\nof peoples. Only when minor affluents unite to form the main stream,\r\nenlarge it in its lower course by an increasing tribute of water, and\r\nextend constantly its tributary area, does a river assume real\r\nhistorical importance. It reaches its fullest significance at its mouth,\r\nwhere it joins the world's highway of the ocean. Here are combined the\r\nbest geographical advantages--participation in the cosmopolitan\r\ncivilization characteristic of coastal regions, opportunity for inland\r\nand maritime commerce, and a fertile alluvial soil yielding support for\r\ndense populations. The predominant importance of the debouchment stretch\r\nof a river is indicated by the presence of such cities as London,\r\nRotterdam, Hamburg, Bremen, Bordeaux, Odessa, Alexandria, Calcutta,\r\nRangoon, Bangkok, Hongkong, Canton, Nanking and Shanghai, Montreal and\r\nQuebec, New York, Philadelphia, New Orleans, Buenos Ayres and\r\nMontevideo. This debouchment stretch gains in practical value and hence\r\nin permanent historical importance if it is swept by a scouring tide,\r\nwhich enables the junction of inland and maritime routes to penetrate\r\ninto the land. Even Strabo recognized this value of tidal reaches.[652]\r\nHence in tideless basins like the Baltic and Caribbean, the great river\r\nports have to advance coastward to meet the sea; and the lower course of\r\neven mighty streams like the Volga and Nile achieve a restricted\r\nimportance.[653]\r\n\r\nThe control of a river mouth becomes a desideratum or necessity to the\r\nupstream people. Otherwise they may be bottled up. Though history shows\r\nus countless instances of upstream expansion, nevertheless owing to the\r\nease of downstream navigation and this increasing historical importance\r\nfrom source to mouth, the direction of a river's flow has often\r\ndetermined the course of commerce and of political expansion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Location at hydrographic centers.]\r\n\r\nThe possibility of radial expansion, which we have found to be the chief\r\nadvantage of a central location, is greatly enhanced if that central\r\nlocation coincides with a hydrographic center of low relief. The tenth\r\ncentury nucleus of the Russian Empire was found about the low nodal\r\nwatershed formed by the Valdai Hills, whence radiated the rivers later\r\nembodied in the Muscovite domain. Here In Novgorod at the head of the\r\nVolchov-Ladoga-Neva system, Pskof on the Velikaya, Tver at the head of\r\nthe navigable Volga, Moscow on the Oka, Smolensk on the Dnieper, and\r\nVitebsk on the Duna, were gathered the Russians destined to displace the\r\nprimitive Finnish population and appropriate the wide plains of eastern\r\nEurope. Everywhere their conquests, colonization, and commercial\r\nrelations have followed the downstream course of their rivers. The\r\nDnieper carried the Rus of Smolensk and Kief to the Euxine, into contact\r\nwith the Byzantine world, and brought thence religion, art, and\r\narchitecture for the untutored empire of the north. The influence of the\r\nVolga has been irresistible. Down its current Novgorod traders in the\r\ntwelfth century sought the commerce of the Caspian and the Orient; and\r\nlater the Muscovite princes pushed their conquest of the Tartar hordes\r\nfrom Asia. The Northern Dwina, Onega, Mesen and Petchora have carried\r\nlong narrow bands of Slav settlement northward to the Arctic Ocean. [See\r\nmap page 225.] Medieval Russian trade from Hanseatic Pskof and Novgorod,\r\nand later Russian dominion followed the Narva and Neva to the Baltic.\r\n\"The Dnieper made Russia Byzantine, the Volga made It Asiatic. It was\r\nfor the Neva to make it European.\"[654]\r\n\r\nIn the same way, when the early French explorers and traders of Canada\r\nreached the hydrographic center of the continent about Lakes Superior\r\nand Michigan, they quickly crossed the low rim of these basins southward\r\nto the Mississippi, and northward to the Rainy Lake and Winnipeg system\r\ndraining to Hudson Bay.[655] While it took them from 1608 to 1659 and\r\n1662 to penetrate upstream from Quebec to this central watershed, only\r\nnine years elapsed from the time (1673) Marquette reached the westward\r\nflowing Wisconsin River to 1682, when La Salle reached the mouth of the\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effect of current upon trade and expansion.]\r\n\r\nThe effect of mere current upon the course of trade and political\r\nexpansion was conspicuous in the early history of the Mississippi\r\nValley, before steam navigation began to modify the geographic\r\ninfluence of a river's flow. The wide forest-grown barrier of the\r\nAppalachian Mountains placed the western pioneers under the geographic\r\ncontrol of the western waters. The bulkiness of their field and forest\r\nproducts, fitted only for water transportation, and the immense mass of\r\ndownstream commerce called loudly for a maritime outlet and the\r\nacquisition from Spain of some port at the Mississippi mouth. For twenty\r\nyears the politics of this transmontane country centered about the\r\n\"Island of New Orleans,\" and in 1803 saw its dream realized by the\r\nLouisiana Purchase.\r\n\r\nFor the western trader, the Mississippi and Ohio were preeminently\r\ndownstream paths. Gravity did the work. Only small boats, laden with\r\nfine commodities of small bulk and large value, occasionally made the\r\nforty day upstream voyage from New Orleans to Louisville. Flat boats and\r\nbarges that were constructed at Pittsburg for the river traffic were\r\nregularly broken up for lumber at downstream points like Louisville and\r\nNew Orleans; for the traders returned overland by the old Chickasaw\r\nTrail to the Cumberland and Ohio River settlements, carrying their\r\nprofits in the form of gold. The same thing happens today, as it also\r\nhappened two thousand years ago, on the Tigris and Euphrates. The\r\nhighlander of Armenia or northern Mesopotamia floats down the current in\r\nhis skin boat or on his brushwood raft, to sell his goods and the wood\r\nforming the frame-work of his primitive craft in timberless Bagdad and\r\nBusra, as formerly in treeless Babylon. He dries out his skins, loads\r\nthem on his shoulders or on a mule brought down for the purpose, and\r\nreturns on foot to his highland village.[656] The same preponderance of\r\ndownstream traffic appears to-day in eastern Siberia. Pedlers on the\r\nAmur start in the spring from Stretensk, 2025 miles up the river, with\r\ntheir wares in barges, and drift down with the current, selling at the\r\nvillages _en route_, to the river's mouth at Nikolaievsk. Here they\r\ndispose of their remaining stock and also of their barges, the lumber of\r\nwhich is utilized for sidewalks, and they themselves return upstream by\r\nsteamer. The grain barges of western Siberia, like the coal barges of\r\nthe Mississippi, even within recent decades, are similarly disposed of\r\nat the journey's end.[657] The tonnage of downstream traffic on the Ohio\r\nand Mississippi to-day greatly exceeds that upstream. The fleet of 56\r\ncoal boats, carrying about 70,000 tons, which the great towboat Sprague\r\ntakes in a single trip from Louisville down to New Orleans, all return\r\nempty. Of the 15,226,805 net tons of freight shipped in 1906 on the Ohio\r\nsystem, 13,980,368 tons of coal, stone, sand and lumber were carried in\r\nunrigged craft, fitted chiefly for downstream traffic.[658]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Importance of mouth to upstream people.]\r\n\r\nOwing to the strong pull exerted by a river's mouth upon all its basin,\r\ncurrent, commerce and people alike tend to reach the ocean. For a nation\r\nholding the terrestrial course of a stream, the political fate of its\r\ntidal course or mouth must always be a matter of great concern. To the\r\nearly westerner of the United States, before the acquisition of the\r\nLouisiana country, it was of vital importance whether belligerent France\r\nor more amenable Spain or the Republic itself should own the mouth of\r\nthe Mississippi. Germany, which holds 240 miles (400 kilometers) of the\r\nnavigable Danube,[659] can never be indifferent to the political\r\nownership of its mouth, or to the fact that a great power like Russia\r\nhas edged forward, by the acquisition of Bessarabia in 1878, to the\r\nnorthern or Kilia debouchment channel.[660] Such interest shows itself in\r\nsustained efforts either to gain political control of the mouth, or to\r\nsecure the neutrality of the stream by having it declared an\r\ninternational waterway, and thus partially to deprive the state holding\r\nits mouth of the advantages of its transit location.\r\n\r\nThe only satisfactory solution is undivided political ownership. After\r\nFrance pushed eastward to the Rhine in 1648, she warred for three\r\ncenturies to acquire its mouth. Napoleon laid claim to Belgium and\r\nHolland on the ground that their soil had been built up by the alluvium\r\nof French rivers. Germany's conquest of Schleswig-Holstein in 1864 was\r\nsignificant chiefly because it dislodged Denmark from the right bank of\r\nthe lower Elbe, and secured undivided control of this important estuary.\r\nThe Rhine, which traverses the Empire from north to south and\r\nconstitutes its greatest single trade route, gives to Germany a more\r\nvital interest in Holland than ever France had. Her most important iron\r\nand coal mines and manufacturing industries are located on this\r\nwaterway or its tributaries, the Ruhr, Mosel, Saar and Main. Hence the\r\nRhine is the great artery of German trade and outlet for her enormous\r\nexports, which chiefly reach the sea through the ports of Belgium and\r\nHolland. These two countries therefore fatten on German commerce and\r\nreduce German profits. Hence the Empire, by the construction of the\r\nEmden-Dortmund canal, aims to divert its trade from Rotterdam and\r\nAntwerp to a German port, and possibly thereby put the screw on Holland\r\nto draw her into some kind of a commercial union with Germany.[661]\r\nHeinrich von Treitschke, in his \"_Politik_,\" deplores the fact that the\r\nmost valuable part of the great German river has fallen into alien\r\nhands, and he declares it to be an imperative task of German policy to\r\nrecover the mouth of that stream, \"either by a commercial or political\r\nunion.\" \"We need the entrance of Holland into our customs union as we\r\nneed our daily bread.\"[662]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prevention of monopoly of river mouth.]\r\n\r\nWhen the middle and upper course of a river system are shared by several\r\nnations, their common interest demands that the control of the mouth be\r\ndivided, as in the case of the La Plata between Argentine and Uruguay;\r\nor held by a small state, like Holland, too weak to force the monopoly\r\nof the tidal course. The Treaty of Paris in 1856 extended the territory\r\nof Moldavia at the cost of Russia, to keep the Russian frontier away\r\nfrom the Danube.[663] Her very presence was ominous. The temptation to\r\ngiant powers to gobble up these exquisite morsels of territory is\r\nirresistible. Hence the advisability of neutralizing small states\r\nholding such locations, as in the case of Roumania; and making their\r\nrivers international waterways, as in the case of the Orinoco,[664]\r\nScheldt, Waal, Rhine and Danube.[665] The Yangtze Kiang mouth, where\r\nalready the treaty ports cluster thick, will probably be the first part\r\nof China to be declared neutral ground, and as such to be placed under\r\nthe protection of the combined commercial powers,[666] as is even now\r\nforeshadowed by the International Conservancy Board of 1910.[667] The\r\nUnited States, by her treaty with Mexico in 1848, secured the right of\r\nfree navigation on the lower or Mexican course of the Colorado River and\r\nthe Gulf of California. The Franco-British convention, which in 1898\r\nconfirmed the western Sudan to France, also conceded the principle of\r\nmaking the Niger, the sole outlet of this vast and isolated territory,\r\nan international waterway, and created two French _enclaves_ in British\r\nNigeria to serve as river ports.[668]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Motive for canals in lower course.]\r\n\r\nThe mouth of a large river system is the converging point of many lines\r\nof inland and maritime navigation. The interests of commerce, especially\r\nin its earlier periods of development, demand that the contact here of\r\nriver and sea be extensive as possible. Nature suggests the way to\r\nfulfill this requirement. The sluggish lowland current of a river, on\r\napproaching sea level, throws out distributaries that reach the coast at\r\nvarious points and form a network of channels, which can be deepened and\r\nrendered permanent by canalization. In such regions the opportunity for\r\nthe improvement and extension of waterways has been utilized from the\r\nearliest times. The ancient Egyptians, Chaldeans, East Indians, and the\r\nGauls of the lower Po for thousands of years canaled the waters of their\r\ndeltas and coastal lowlands for the combined purpose of irrigation,\r\ndrainage, and navigation. The great canal system of China, constructed\r\nin the seventh century primarily to facilitate Inland intercourse\r\nbetween the northern and central sections of the Empire, extends from\r\nthe sea at Hangchow 700 miles northward through the coastal alluvium of\r\nthe Yangtze Kiang, Hoang-ho and Pie-ho to Tientsin, the port of Peking.\r\nOnly the canal system of the center, important both for the irrigation\r\nof the fertile but porous loess and for the transportation of crops, is\r\nstill in repair. Here the meshes of the canal network are little more\r\nthan half a mile wide; farmers dig canals to their barns and bring in\r\ntheir produce in barges instead of hay wagons.[669] Holland, where the\r\nancient Romans constructed channels in the Rhine delta and where the\r\ndebouchment courses of the Rhine, Meuse and Scheldt present a labyrinth\r\nof waterways, has to-day 1903 miles (3069 kilometers) of canals, which\r\ntogether with the navigable rivers, have been important geographic\r\nfactors in the historical preëminence of Dutch foreign commerce. So on\r\nthe lower Mississippi, in the greatest alluvial area of the United\r\nStates, the government has expended large sums for the improvement of\r\nthe passes and bayous of the river. The Barataria, Atchafalaya,\r\nTerrebonne, Black, Teche and Lafourche bayous have been rendered\r\nnavigable, and New Orleans has been given canal outlets to the sea\r\nthrough Lakes Salvador, Pontchartrain and Borgne.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Watershed canals.]\r\n\r\nAs the dividing channels of the lower course point to the feasibility of\r\namplifying the connection with the ocean highway, so the spreading\r\nbranches of a river's source, which approach other head waters on a low\r\ndivide, suggest the extension of inland navigation by the union of two\r\nsuch drainage systems through canals. Where the rivers of a country\r\nradiate from a relatively low central watershed, as from the Central\r\nPlateau of France and the Valdai Hills of Russia, nature offers\r\nconditions for extensive linking of inland waterways. Hence we find a\r\ncontinuous passway through Russia from the Caspian Sea to the Baltic by\r\nthe canal uniting the Volga and Neva rivers; another from the Black Sea\r\nup the Dnieper, which by canals finds three different outlets to the\r\nBaltic through the Vistula, Niemen and Duna.[670] The Northern Dwina,\r\nlinked, by canals, with the Neva through Lakes Onega and Ladoga, unites\r\nthe White Sea with the Baltic.[671] Sully, the great minister of Henry\r\nIV. of France, saw that the relief of the country would permit the\r\nlinking of the Loire, Seine, Meuse, Saône and Rhine, and the\r\nMediterranean with the Garonne. All his plans were carried out by his\r\nsuccessors, but he himself, at the end of the sixteenth century, began\r\nthe construction of the Briare Canal between the Loire near Orleans and\r\nthe Seine at Fontainebleau.[672] Similarly in the eastern half of the\r\nUnited States, the long, low watershed separating the drainage basin of\r\nthe St. Lawrence and Great Lakes from that of the Mississippi and the\r\nHudson made feasible the succession of canals completing the \"Great\r\nBelt\" of inland navigation from St. Lawrence and New York bays to the\r\nGulf. Albert Gallatin's famous report of 1808[673] pointed out the\r\nadaptation of the three low divides to canal communication; but long\r\nbefore this, every line of possible canoe travel by river and portage\r\nover swamp or lake-dotted watershed had been used by savages, white\r\nexplorers and French voyageurs, from Lake Champlain to Lake Winnebago,\r\nso that the canal engineer had only to select from the numerous portage\r\npaths already beaten out by the moccasined feet of Indian or fur-trader.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rivers and railroads.]\r\n\r\nThe cheapness and ease of river travel have tended to check or delay the\r\nconstruction of highroads and railways, where facilities for inland\r\nnavigation have been abundant, and later to regulate railway freight\r\ncharges. Conversely, riverless lands have everywhere experienced an\r\nexaggerated and precocious railroad development, and have suffered from\r\nits monopoly of transportation. Even canals have in most lands had a far\r\nearlier date than paved highroads. This has been true of Spain, France,\r\nHolland, and England.[674] In the Hoang-ho Valley of northern China where\r\nwaterways are restricted, owing to the rapid current and shallowness of\r\nthis river, highroads are comparatively common; but they are very rare\r\nin central and southern China where navigable rivers and canals\r\nabound.[675] New England, owing to its lack of inland navigation, was the\r\nfirst part of the United States to develop a complete system of\r\nturnpikes and later of railroads. On the other hand, the great river\r\nvalleys of America have generally slighted the highroad phase of\r\ncommunication, and slowly passed to that of railroads. The abundance of\r\nnatural waterways in Russia--51,800 miles including canals--has\r\ncontributed to the retardation of railroad construction.[676] The same\r\nthing is true in the Netherlands, where 4875 miles (7863 kilometers) of\r\nnavigable waterways[677] in an area of only 12,870 square miles (33,000\r\nsquare kilometers) have kept the railroads down to a paltry 1818 miles\r\n(2931 kilometers); but smaller Belgium, commanding only 1375 miles (3314\r\nkilometers) of waterway and stimulated further by a remarkable\r\nindustrial and commercial development, has constructed 4228 miles (6819\r\nkilometers) of railroad.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Relation of rivers to railroads in recent colonial lands.]\r\n\r\nIf we compare the countries of Central and South America, where\r\nrailroads are still mere adjuncts of river and coastwise routes, a stage\r\nof development prevalent in the United States till 1858, we find an\r\nunmistakable relation between navigable waterways and railroad mileage.\r\nThe countries with ample or considerable river communication, like\r\nBrazil, Venezuela, Colombia and Paraguay, are all relatively slow in\r\nlaying railroads as compared with Mexico and Argentine, even when\r\nallowance is made for differences of zonal location, economic\r\ndevelopment, and degree of European elements in their respective\r\npopulations. Mexico and Argentine, having each an area only about\r\none-fourth that of Brazil but a railroad mileage nearly one-fourth\r\ngreater, have been pushed to this development primarily by a common lack\r\nof inland navigation. Similarly South Africa, stricken with poverty of\r\nwater communication south of the Zambesi, has constructed 7500 miles of\r\nrailroads[678] in spite of the youth of the country and the sparsity of\r\nits white population. Similar geographic conditions have forced the\r\nmileage of Australian railways up to twice that of South Africa, in a\r\ncountry which is still in the pastoral and agricultural stage of\r\ndevelopment, and whose most densely populated province Victoria has only\r\nfourteen inhabitants to the square mile. In the almost unpeopled wastes\r\nof Trans-Caspia, where two decades ago the camel was the only carrier,\r\nthe Russian railroad has worked a commercial revolution by stimulating\r\nproduction and affording an outlet for the irrigated districts of the\r\nencircling mountains.[679] In our own Trans-Missouri country, where the\r\nscanty volume of the streams eliminated all but the Missouri itself as a\r\ndependable waterway, even for the canoe travel of the early western\r\ntrappers, railroads have developed unchecked by the competition of river\r\ntransportation.[680] With no rival nearer than the Straits of Magellan\r\nand the Isthmus of Panama for transportation between the Mississippi and\r\nthe Pacific coast, they have fixed their own charges on a monopoly\r\nbasis, and have fought the construction of the Isthmian Canal.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Unity of a river system.]\r\n\r\nA river system is a system of communication. It therefore makes a bond\r\nof union between the people living among its remoter sources and those\r\nsettled at its mouth. Every such river system forms geographically an\r\nunbroken whole. Only where a wild, torrent-filled gorge, like the\r\nBrahmaputra's path through the Himalayas, interrupts communication\r\nbetween the upper and lower course, is human life in the two sections\r\ndivorced. But such cases are rare. Even the River Jhelam, which springs\r\nwith mad bounds from the lofty Vale of Kashmir through the outer range\r\nof the Himalayas down to its junction with the Indus, carries quantities\r\nof small logs to be used as railway sleepers; and though it shatters a\r\nlarge per cent. of them, it makes a link between the lumber men of the\r\nKashmir forests and British railroad engineers in the treeless plains of\r\nthe Indus.[681]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The effect of common water supply in arid lands.]\r\n\r\nIn arid lands, where the scant and variable streams are useless for\r\nnavigation, but invaluable for irrigation, a rival interest in the\r\nlimited water supply leads almost inevitably to conflict, and often to\r\nthe political union of the peoples holding the upper and lower courses,\r\nin order to secure adjustment of their respective claims. The ancient\r\nSalassi of the upper Doria Baltea Valley in the Alps drew off all the\r\nwater of the stream for washing gold, and thus deprived the agricultural\r\npeople lower down the valley of the water necessary for irrigation. The\r\nresult was frequent wars between the two tribes.[682] The offensive is\r\ntaken by the downstream people, whose fields and gardens suffer from\r\nevery extension of tillage or increase of population in the settlements\r\nabove them. Occasionally a formal agreement is a temporary expedient.\r\nThe River Firenze and other streams watering southern Trans-Caspia have\r\ntheir sources in the mountains of northern Persia; hence the Russians,\r\nin the boundary convention with Persia of 1881, stipulated that no new\r\nsettlement be established along these streams within Persian territory,\r\nno extension of land under cultivation beyond the present amount, and no\r\neduction of the water beyond that necessary to irrigate the existing\r\nfields.[683] Russia's designs upon Afghanistan aim not only at access to\r\nIndia, but also at the control of the upper Murghab River, on whose\r\nwater depends the prosperity of the Pendjeh and Merv oases.[684] In such\r\nregions the only logical course is the extension of the political\r\nfrontier to the watershed, a principle which Russia is applying in\r\nwestern Asia, and which California applied in drawing her eastern\r\nboundary to include even Goose Lake.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Union of opposite river banks.]\r\n\r\nRivers unite. Ancient Rome grew up on both banks of the Tiber, and\r\nextended her commercial and political supremacy up and down stream. Both\r\nsides of the Rhine were originally occupied by the Gallic tribes, whose\r\nvillages were in some instances bisected by the river. Cæsar found the\r\nMenapii, a Belgian people on the lower Rhine, with their fields,\r\nfarmhouses and villages on both banks.[685] Then the westward advance of\r\nthe Teutonic tribes gradually transformed the Rhine into a German river,\r\nfrom the island of Batavia at its mouth up to the great elbow at the\r\nfoot of the Jura Mountains.[686] To the American Indians even the widest\r\nrivers were no barriers. Christopher Gist, exploring the Ohio in 1751,\r\nfound a Shawnee village situated on both sides of the river below the\r\nmouth of the Scioto, with about a hundred houses on the north bank and\r\nforty on the south.[687] The small and unique nation of the Mandan\r\nIndians were found by Lewis and Clark near the northern bend of the\r\nMissouri in 1804, in two groups of villages on opposite sides of the\r\nriver. They had previously in 1772 occupied nine villages lower down the\r\nstream, two on the east bank and seven on the west.[688] The Connecticut\r\nRiver settlers of early colonial days laid out all their towns straight\r\nacross the valley, utilizing the alluvial meadows on both banks for\r\ntillage, the terraces for residence sites, and the common river for\r\nintercourse.[689]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tendency toward ethnic and cultural unity in a river valley.]\r\n\r\nEvery river tends to become a common artery feeding all the life of its\r\nbasin, and gradually obliterating ethnic and cultural differences among\r\nthe peoples of its valley. The Nile, with its narrow hem of flood-plain\r\non either bank and barrier sands beyond, has so linked race and history\r\nin Egypt and Nubia, that the two countries cannot be separated. A common\r\nhighway from mountains to sea, a common frontier of trackless desert\r\nhave developed here a blended similarity of race, language and culture\r\nfrom the delta to Kordofan. The Hamitic race seems to have originated in\r\nthe south and migrated northward down the Nile towards the delta. Later\r\nthe whole valley, north and south, received the same Semitic or Arab\r\nimmigration, which spread from Cairo to the old Sudanese capital of\r\nSennar, while a strain of negro blood has filtered in from the\r\nequatorial black belt and followed the current down to the sea.[690] The\r\nculture of the valley originated in Lower Egypt, and, with that easy\r\ntransmissibility which characterizes ideas, it moved upstream into\r\nEthiopia, which never evolved a culture of its own. Just as noticeable\r\nis the political interplay. The rule of the Pharaohs extended far up the\r\nNile, at times to the Third Cataract at 20° N.L.; and at one period\r\nEthiopian kings extended their sway over Egypt. At another, a large body\r\nof mutinous Egyptian soldiers abandoned their country and their wives,\r\nand emigrated along the one line of slight resistance open to them into\r\nEthiopia, to found there a new state and new families by marriage with\r\nnative women, thus contributing to the amalgamation of races in the\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Identity of country with river valley.]\r\n\r\nThe most pronounced types of the identity of a country with a river\r\nvalley are found where strongly marked geographical boundaries, like\r\ndeserts and mountains, emphasize the inner unity of the basins by\r\naccentuating their isolation from without. This is especially the case\r\nin high mountain regions; here canton or commune or county coincides\r\nwith the river valley. Population hugs the margins of the streams where\r\nalone is soil fit for cultivation, and fairly level land suitable for\r\ndwellings. Above are the unoccupied heights, at once barrier and\r\nboundary. In the Alps, Salzburg is approximately identical with the\r\nvalley of the Salzach, Uri with that of the Reuss, the Valais with the\r\nupper Rhone, the Engadine with the upper Inn, Glarus with the Linth,\r\nGraubünden or Grisons with the upper Rhine, Valtellina with the Adda. So\r\nin the great upheaved area of the Himalayas, the state of Kashmir was\r\noriginally the valley of the upper Jhelam River, while Assam, in its\r\ncorrect delimitation, is the valley of the Brahmaputra between the\r\nHimalayan gorge and the swamps of Bengal.[691]\r\n\r\nIn mountain regions which are also arid, the identity of a district with\r\na stream basin becomes yet more pronounced, because here population must\r\ngather about the common water supply, must organize to secure its fair\r\ndistribution, and cooperate in the construction of irrigation channels\r\nto make the distribution as economical and effective as possible. Thus\r\nin Chinese Turkestan, the districts of Yarkand, Kashgar, Aksu and\r\nKut-sha are identical with as many mountain tributaries of the Tarim,\r\nwhose basin in turn comprises almost the whole of Chinese Turkestan.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Enclosed river valleys.]\r\n\r\nIn all such desert and mountain-rimmed valleys, the central stream\r\nattracts to its narrow hem of alluvial soil the majority of the\r\npopulation, determines the course of the main highroad, and is itself\r\noften the only route through the encompassing barriers. Hence the\r\nimportance attached to the river by the inhabitants, an importance\r\nreflected in the fact that the river often gives its name to the whole\r\ndistrict. To the most ancient Greeks _Aigiptos_ meant the river, whose\r\nname was later transferred to the whole land; for the narrow arable\r\nstrip which constituted Egypt was \"the gift of the Nile.\" The Aryans,\r\ndescending into India through the mountains on its northwest border,\r\ngave the name of _Sindhu_, \"the flood\" or \"the ocean,\" to the first\r\ngreat river they met. In the mouth of Persians and Greeks the name was\r\ncorrupted into Indus, and then applied to the whole country; but it\r\nstill survives in its original form in the local designation of the Sind\r\nprovince, which comprises the valley of the Indus below the confluence\r\nof the five rivers, which again formed and named the original Punjab.\r\nSignificantly enough the western political boundary of the Sind extends\r\ninto the barren foothills of Baluchistan only so far as the affluents of\r\nthe Indus render the land arable by irrigation; for the Indus performs\r\nfor the great province of the Sind, by annual inundation and perennial\r\nirrigation, the same service that the Nile does for Egypt.\r\n\r\nThe segregation of such districts, and the concentration of their\r\ninterests and activities along the central streams have tended to\r\ndevelop in the population an intense but contracted national\r\nconsciousness, and to lend them a distinctive history. Their rivers\r\nbecome interwoven with their mythology and religion, are gods to be\r\nworshipped or appeased, become goals of pilgrimages, or acquire a\r\npeculiar sanctity. The Nile, Ganges, Jamna, Jordan, Tiber and Po are\r\nsuch sacred streams, while the Rhine figures in German mythology.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rivers as boundaries of races and peoples.]\r\n\r\nFrom the uniting power of rivers it follows that they are poor\r\nboundaries. Only mountains and seas divide sharply enough to form\r\nscientific frontiers. Rivers may serve as political lines of demarcation\r\nand therefore fix political frontiers; but they can never take the place\r\nof natural boundaries. A migrating or expanding people tend always to\r\noccupy both slopes of a river valley. They run their boundary of race or\r\nlanguage across the axis of their river basin, only under exceptional\r\ncircumstances along the stream itself. The English-French boundary in\r\nthe St. Lawrence Valley crosses the river in a broad transitional zone\r\nof mingled people and speech in and above the city of Montreal. The\r\nFrench-German linguistic frontier in Switzerland crosses the upper Rhone\r\nValley just above Sierre, but the whole canton of Valais above the elbow\r\nof the river at Martigny shows fundamental ethnic unity, indicated by\r\nidentity of head form, stature and coloring.[692] Where the Elbe flows\r\nthrough the low plains of North Germany, its whole broad valley is\r\noccupied by a pure Teutonic population--fair, tall, long-headed; a more\r\nbrunette type occupies its middle course across the uplands of Saxony,\r\nand speaks German like the downstream folk; but its upper course, hemmed\r\nin by the Erz and Riesen Mountains, shows the short, dark and\r\nbroad-headed people of the Bohemian basin, speaking the Czech\r\nlanguage.[693] On the Danube, too, the same thing is true. The upper\r\nstream is German in language and predominantly Alpine in race stock down\r\nto the Austro-Hungarian boundary; from this point to the Drave mouth it\r\nis Hungarian; and from the Drave to the Iron Gate it is Serbo-Croatian\r\non both banks.[694] Lines of ethnic demarcation, therefore, cut the Elbe\r\nand Danube transversely, not longitudinally. [See map page 223.]\r\n\r\nThe statements of Cæsar and Pliny that the Seine and Marne formed the\r\nboundary between the Gauls and Belgians, and the Garonne that between\r\nthe Gauls and Aquitanians, must be accepted merely as general and\r\npreliminary; for exceptions are noted later in the text. Parisii, for\r\ninstance, were represented as holding both banks of the Seine and Marne\r\nat their confluence, and the Gallic Bituriges were found on the\r\nAquitanian side of the Garonne estuary.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Scientific river boundaries.]\r\n\r\nOnly under peculiar conditions do rivers become effective as ethnic,\r\ntribal or political boundaries. Most often it is some physiographic\r\nfeature which makes the stream an obstacle to communication, and lends\r\nit the character of a scientific boundary. The division of the Alpine\r\nforeland of southern Germany first into tribal and later into political\r\nprovinces by the Iller, Lech, Inn, and Salzach can be ascribed in part\r\nto the tumultuous course of these streams from the mountains to the\r\nDanube, which renders them useless for communication.[695] The lower\r\nDanube forms a well maintained linguistic boundary between the\r\nBulgarians and Roumanians, except in the northwest corner of Bulgaria,\r\nwhere the hill country between the Timok River and the Danube has\r\nenticed a small group of Roumanians across to the southern side. From\r\nthis point down the stream, a long stretch of low marshy bank on the\r\nnorthern side, offering village sites only at the few places where the\r\nloess terrace of Roumania comes close to the river, exposed to\r\noverflows, strewn with swamps and lakes, and generally unfit for\r\nsettlement, has made the Danube an effective barrier.[696] Similarly, the\r\nbroad, sluggish Shannon River, which spreads out to lake breadth at\r\nclose intervals in its course across the boggy central plain of Ireland,\r\nhas from the earliest times proved a sufficient barrier to divide the\r\nplain into two portions, Connaught and Meath,[697] contrasted in history,\r\nin speech and to some extent even in race elements.[698] A different\r\ncause gave the Thames its unique rôle among the larger English rivers as\r\na boundary between counties from source to mouth. London's fortified\r\nposition at the head of the Thames estuary closed this stream as a line\r\nof invasion to the early Saxons, and forced them to make detours to the\r\nnorth and south of the river, which therefore became a tribal\r\nboundary.[699]\r\n\r\nWhere navigation is peculiarly backward, a river may present a barrier.\r\nAn instructive instance is afforded by the River Yo, which flows\r\neastward through northern Bornu into Lake Chad, and serves at once as\r\nboundary and protection to the agricultural tribes of the Kanuri\r\nagainst the depredations of the Tibbu robbers living in the Sahara or\r\nthe northern grassland. But during the dry season from April to August,\r\nwhen the trickling stream is sucked up by the thirsty land and thirstier\r\nair, the Tibbu horsemen sweep down on the unprotected Kanuri and retreat\r\nwith their booty across the vanished barrier. The primitive navigation\r\nby reed or brushwood rafts, practiced in this almost streamless\r\ndistrict, affords no means of retreat for mounted robbers; so the\r\nraiding season opens with the fall of the river.[700]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rivers as political boundaries.]\r\n\r\nFor political boundaries, which are often adopted with little reference\r\nto race distribution, rivers serve fairly well. They are convenient\r\nlines of demarcation and strategic lines of defense, as is proved by the\r\nmilitary history of the Rhine, Danube, Ebro, Po, and countless other\r\nstreams. On the lower Zambesi Livingstone found the territories of the\r\nlesser chiefs defined by the rivulets draining into the main river. The\r\nleader of the Makololo formally adopted the Zambesi as his political and\r\nmilitary frontier, though his people spread and settled beyond the\r\nriver.[701] Long established political frontiers may become ethnic\r\nboundaries, more or less distinct, because of protracted political\r\nexclusion. To the Romans, the Danube and Rhine as a northeastern\r\nfrontier had the value chiefly of established lines in an imperfectly\r\nexplored wilderness, and of strategic positions for the defense of an\r\noft assailed border; but the long maintenance of this political frontier\r\nresulted in the partial segregation and hence differentiation of the\r\npeople dwelling on the opposite banks.\r\n\r\nPoor as a scientific boundary, a river is not satisfactory even as a\r\nline of demarcation, because of its tendency to shift its bed in every\r\nlevel stretch of its course. A political boundary that follows a river,\r\ntherefore, is often doomed to frequent surveys. The plantations on the\r\nmeanders of the lower Mississippi are connected now with one, now with\r\nthe other of the contiguous states, as the great stream straightens its\r\ncourse after the almost annual overflow.[702] The Rio Grande has proved a\r\ntroublesome and expensive boundary between the United States and\r\nMexico. Almost every rise sees it cutting a new channel for itself, now\r\nthrough Texas, now through Mexican territory, occasioning endless\r\ncontroversies as to the ownership of the detached land, and demanding\r\nfresh surveys. Recent changes in the lower course of the Helmund between\r\nNasralabad and the Sistan Swamp, which was adopted in 1872 as the\r\nboundary between Afghanistan and Persia, have necessitated a new\r\ndemarcation of the frontier; and on this task a commission is at present\r\nengaged.[703] In a like manner Strabo tells us that the River Achelous,\r\nforming the boundary between ancient Acarnania and Aetolia in western\r\nHellas, by overflowing its delta region, constantly obliterated the\r\nboundaries agreed upon by the two neighbors, and thereby gave rise to\r\ndisputes that were only settled by force of arms.[704]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fluvial settlements and peoples.]\r\n\r\nRivers tend always to be centers of population, not outskirts or\r\nperimeters. They offer advantages that have always attracted\r\nsettlement--fertile alluvial soil, a nearby water supply, command of a\r\nnatural highway for intercourse with neighbors and access to markets.\r\nAmong civilized peoples fluvial settlements have been the nuclei of\r\nbroad states, passing rapidly through an embryonic development to a\r\nmaturity in which the old center can still be distinguished by a greater\r\ndensity of population. Only among savages or among civilized people who\r\nhave temporarily reverted to primitive conditions in virgin colonial\r\nlands, do we find genuine riverine folk, whose existence is closely\r\nrestricted to their bordering streams. The river tribes of the Congo\r\noccupy the banks or the larger islands, while the land only three or\r\nfour miles back from the stream is held by different tribes with whom\r\nthe riverine people trade their fish. The latter are expert fishermen\r\nand navigators, and good agriculturists, raising a variety of fruits and\r\nvegetables. On the river banks at regular intervals are market greens,\r\nneutral ground, whither people come from up and down stream and from the\r\ninterior to trade. Their long riparian villages consist of a single\r\nstreet, thirty feet wide and often two miles long, on which face perhaps\r\nthree hundred long houses,[705] Fisher and canoe people line the Welle,\r\nthe great northern tributary of the Congo.[706] The same type appeared\r\nin South America in the aboriginal Caribs and Tupis dwelling along the\r\nsouthern tributaries of the Amazon and the affluents of the Paraguay.\r\nThese were distinctly a water race, having achieved a meager development\r\nonly in navigation, fishing and the cultivation of their alluvial\r\nsoil.[707] The ancient mound-builders of America located their villages\r\nchiefly, though not exclusively, along the principal watercourses, like\r\nthe Mississippi, Illinois, Miami, Wabash, Wisconsin, and Fox,[708] on the\r\nvery streams later dotted by the trading posts of the French voyageurs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Riparian villages of French Canada.]\r\n\r\nThe presence of the great waterways of Canada and the demand of the fur\r\ntrade for extensive and easy communication made the early French\r\ncolonists as distinctly a riverine people as the savage Congo tribes.\r\nLike these, they stretched out their villages in a single line of cabins\r\nand clearings, three or four miles long, facing the river, which was the\r\nKing's highway. Such a village was called a _côte_. One côte ran into\r\nthe next, for their expansion was always longitudinal, never lateral.\r\nThese riparian settlements lined the main watercourses of French Canada,\r\nespecially the St. Lawrence, whose shores from Beaupre, fifteen miles\r\nbelow Quebec, up to Montreal at an early date presented the appearance\r\nof a single street. Along the river passed the stately trading ship from\r\nFrance with its cargo of wives and merchandise for the colonists, the\r\npirogue of the _habitant_ farmer carrying his onions and grain to the\r\nQuebec market, the birchbark canoe of the adventurous voyageur bringing\r\ndown his winter's hunt of furs from the snow-bound forests of the\r\ninterior, and the fleet of Jesuit priests bound to some remote inland\r\nmission.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE RIPARIAN VILLAGES OF THE LOWER ST. LAWRENCE.]\r\n\r\nOn this water thoroughfare every dwelling faced. Hence land on the river\r\nwas at a premium, while that two miles back was to be had for the\r\ntaking. The original grants measured generally 766 feet in width and\r\n7,660 in depth inland; but when bequeathed from generation to\r\ngeneration, they were divided up along lines running back at right\r\nangles to the all important waterway. Hence each _habitant_ farm\r\nmeasured its precious river-front by the foot and its depth by the mile,\r\nwhile the cabins were ranged side by side in cosy neighborliness. The\r\n_côte_ type of village, though eminently convenient for the Indian\r\ntrade, was ill adapted for government and defense against the savages;\r\nbut the need for the communication supplied by the river was so\r\nfundamental, that it nullified all efforts of the authorities to\r\nconcentrate the colonists in more compact settlements. Parkman says:\r\n\"One could have seen almost every house in Canada by paddling a canoe up\r\nthe St. Lawrence and Richelieu.\"[709] The same type of land-holding can\r\nbe traced to-day on the Chaudiere River, where the fences run back from\r\nthe stream like the teeth of a comb. It is reproduced on a larger scale\r\nin the long, narrow counties ranged along the lower St. Lawrence, whose\r\nshape points to the old fluvial nuclei of settlement. Similarly the\r\nearly Dutch grants on the Hudson gave to the patroons four miles along\r\nthe river and an indefinite extension back from the stream. In the early\r\nConnecticut River settlements, the same consideration of a share in the\r\nriver and its alluvial bottoms distributed the town lots among the\r\ninhabitants in long narrow strips running back from the banks.[710]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Boatmen tribes or castes.]\r\n\r\nIn undeveloped countries, where rivers are the chief highways, we\r\noccasionally see the survival of a distinct race of boatmen amid an\r\nintruding people of different stock, preserved in their purity by their\r\npeculiar occupation, which has given them the aloofness of a caste. In\r\nthe Kwang-tung province of southern China are 40,000 Tanka boat people,\r\nwho live in boats and pile-dwellings in the Canton River. The Chinese,\r\nfrom whom they are quite distinct, regard them as a remnant of the\r\noriginal population, which was dislodged by their invasion and forced to\r\ntake refuge on the water. They gradually established intercourse with\r\nthe conquerors of the land, but held themselves aloof. They marry only\r\namong themselves, have their own customs, and enjoy a practical monopoly\r\nof carrying passengers and messages between the steamers and the shore\r\nat Macao, Hongkong and Canton.[711] In the same way, the middle Niger\r\nabove Gao possesses a distinct aquatic people, the Somnos or Bosos, who\r\nearn their living as fishermen and boatmen on the river. They spread\r\ntheir villages along the Niger and its tributaries, and occupy separate\r\nquarters in the large towns like Gao and Timbuctoo. They are creatures\r\nof the river rather than of the land, and show great skill and endurance\r\nin paddling and poling their narrow dugouts on their long Niger\r\nvoyages.[712]\r\n\r\nReference has been made before to the large river population of China\r\nwho live on boats and rafts, and forward the trade of the vast inland\r\nwaterways. These are people, differentiated not in race, but in\r\noccupation and mode of life, constantly recruited from the congested\r\npopulation of the land. Allied to them are the trackers or towing crews\r\nwhose villages form a distinctive feature of the turbulent upper\r\nYangtze, and who are employed, sometimes three hundred at a time, to\r\ndrag junks up the succession of rapids above Ichang.[713] Similarly the\r\ncomplex of navigable waterways centering about Paris, as far back as the\r\nreign of Tiberius Cæsar, gave rise to the _Nautae Parisii_ or guild of\r\nmariners, from whom the city of Paris derived its present coat of\r\narms--a vessel under full sail. These Lutetian boatmen handled the river\r\ntraffic in all the territory drained by the Seine, Marne, and Oise.\r\nLater, in the reign of Louis the Fat, they were succeeded by the\r\n_Mercatores aquae Parisiaci_, and from them sprang the municipal body\r\nappointed to regulate the river navigation and commerce.[714]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: River islands as protected sites.]\r\n\r\nThe location of the ancient tribe of the Parisii is typical of many\r\nother weak riverine folk who seek in the islands of a river a protected\r\nposition to compensate for their paucity of number. The Parisii, one of\r\nthe smallest of the Gallic tribes, ill-matched against their populous\r\nneighbors, took refuge on ten islands and sandbars of the Seine and\r\nthere established themselves.[715] Stanley found an island in the Congo\r\nnear the second cataract of Stanley Falls occupied by five villages of\r\nthe Baswa, who had taken refuge there from the attacks of the\r\nbloodthirsty Bakuma.[716] During the Tartar invasions of Russia in the\r\nthirteenth and fourteenth centuries, bands of refugees from the\r\nsurrounding country gathered for mutual defense on the islands of the\r\nDnieper River, and became the nucleus of the Dnieper Cossacks.[717] The\r\nHuron tribe of American Indians, reduced to a mere fragment by repeated\r\nIroquois attacks, fled first to the islands of St. Joseph and\r\nMichilimackinac in Lake Huron, and in 1856 to the Isle of Orleans in the\r\nSt. Lawrence. But even this location under the guns of their French\r\nallies in Quebec failed to protect them, for the St. Lawrence was a\r\nhighway for the war fleets of their implacable foe.[718]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: River and lake islands as robber strongholds.]\r\n\r\nA river island not only confers the negative benefit of protection, but\r\naffords a coign of vantage for raids on the surrounding country, being\r\nto some extent proof against punitive attacks. It offers special\r\nfacilities for depredations on parties crossing the river; here the\r\ndivided current, losing something of its force, is less of an obstacle,\r\nand the island serves as a resting place on the passage. Immunity from\r\npunishment breeds lawlessness. The Ba Toka who, fifty years ago,\r\ninhabited the islands in the great southern bend of the Zambesi,\r\nutilized their location to lure wandering tribes on to their islands,\r\nunder the pretext of ferrying them across, and then to rob them, till\r\nSebituane, the great Makololo chief, cleaned out their fastnesses and\r\nopened the river for trade.[719] The islands in the wide stretches of the\r\nLualaba River in the Babemba country were described to Livingstone as\r\nharboring a population of marauders and robbers, who felt themselves\r\nsafe from attack.[720] The same unenviable reputation attaches to the\r\nBudumas of the Lake Chad islands. A weak, timid, displaced people, they\r\nnevertheless lose no chance of raiding the herds of the Sudanese tribes\r\ninhabiting the shores of the Lake, and carrying off the stolen cattle on\r\ntheir wretched rafts to their island retreats.[721]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: River peninsulas as protected sites.]\r\n\r\nThe protection of an island location is almost equalled in the\r\npeninsulas formed by the serpentines or meanders of a river. Hence these\r\nare choice sites for fortress or settlement in primitive communities,\r\nwhere hostilities are always imminent and rivers the sole means of\r\ncommunication. The defensive works of the mound-builders in great\r\nnumbers occupied such river peninsulas. The neck of the loop was\r\nfortified by a single or double line of ditch and earthen wall,\r\nconstructed from bank to bank of the encircling stream.[722] This was\r\nexactly the location of Vesontio, now Besançon, once the ancient\r\nstronghold of the Sequani in eastern Gaul. It was situated in a loop of\r\nthe Dubis, so nearly a circle that its course seems to have been\r\n\"described by a compass,\" Cæsar says, while fortifications across the\r\nisthmus made the position of the town almost impregnable.[723] Verona,\r\nlying at the exit of the great martial highway of the Brenner Pass,\r\noccupies just such a loop of the Adige, as does Capua on the Volturno,\r\nand Berne on the Aare. Shrewsbury, in the Middle Ages an important\r\nmilitary point for the preservation of order on the marches of Wales, is\r\nalmost encircled by the River Severn, while a castle on the neck of the\r\npeninsula completes the defense on the land side.[724] Graaf Reinett, at\r\none time an exposed frontier settlement of the Dutch in Cape Colony, had\r\na natural moat around it in the Sunday River, which here describes\r\nthree-fourths of a circle.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: River islands as sites of trading posts and colonies.]\r\n\r\nThe need of protection felt by all colonists in new countries amid\r\nsavage or barbarous people whom encroachment sooner or later makes\r\nhostile, leads them if possible to place their first trading posts and\r\nsettlements on river islands, especially at the mouth of the streams,\r\nwhere a delta often affords the site required, and where the junction of\r\nocean and river highway offers the best facilities for trade. A river\r\nisland fixed the location of the English settlement at Jamestown in\r\nVirginia, the French at Montreal and New Orleans, the Dutch at Manhattan\r\nand Van Renssellær Island in the Hudson, the Swedes at Tinicum Island\r\nin the Delaware River a few miles below the mouth of the Schuylkill.[725]\r\nSt. Louis, located on a delta island of the Senegal River, is one of the\r\noldest European towns in West Africa;[726] and Bathurst, founded in 1618\r\non a similar site at the mouth of the Gambia, has for centuries now been\r\nthe safe outlet for the trade of this stream.[727] Such island\r\nsettlements at river mouths are a phenomenon of the outer edge of every\r\ncoastal region; but inland stations for trade or military control also\r\nseek the protection of an island site. The Russians in the seventeenth\r\ncentury secured their downstream conquest of the Amur by a succession of\r\nriver island forts,[728] which recall Colonel Byrd's early frontier post\r\non an island in the Holston River, and George Rogers Clark's military\r\nstockade on Corn Island in the Ohio, which became the nucleus of the\r\nlater city of Louisville.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Swamps as barriers and boundaries.]\r\n\r\nMore effective than rivers in the protection which they afford are\r\nswamps. Neither solid land nor navigable water, their sluggish, passive\r\nsurface raises an obstacle of pure inertia to the movements of mankind.\r\nHence they form one of those natural boundaries that segregate. In\r\nsouthern England, Ronmey Marsh, reinforced by the Wealden Forest, fixed\r\nthe western boundary of the ancient Saxon kingdom of Kent by blocking\r\nexpansion in that direction, just as the bordering swamps of the Lea and\r\nColne rivers formed the eastern and western boundaries of\r\nMiddlesex.[729] The Fenland of the Wash, which extended in Saxon days\r\nfrom the highland about Lincoln south to Cambridge and Newmarket, served\r\nto hem in the Angles of Norfolk and Suffolk on the west, so that the\r\noccupation of the interior was left to later bands who entered by the\r\nestuaries of the Humber and Forth.[730] In northern Germany, the low\r\ncross valleys of the Spree, Havel and Netze rivers, bordered by alder\r\nswamps, were long a serious obstacle to communication, and therefore\r\nbecame boundaries of districts,[731] just as the Bourtanger Moor drew\r\nthe dividing line between Holland and Hanover.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Swamps as regions of survival.]\r\n\r\nSwamp-bordered regions, as areas of natural isolation, guard and keep\r\nintact the people which they hold. Therefore they are regions of\r\nsurvival of race and language. The scattered islets of the Fens of\r\nEngland furnished an asylum to the early British Celts from Teutonic\r\nattacks,[732] and later protected them against dominant infusion of\r\nTeutonic blood. Hence to-day in the Fenland and in the district just to\r\nthe south we find a darker, shorter people than in the country to the\r\neast or west.[733] Similarly the White Russians, occupying the poor,\r\nmarshy region of uncertain watershed between the sources of the Duna,\r\nDnieper and Volga, have the purest blood of all the eastern Slavs,\r\nthough this distinction is coupled with poverty and retarded\r\nculture,[734] a combination that anthropo-geography often reveals.\r\nWholly distinct from the Russians and segregated from them by a barrier\r\nof swampy forests, we find the Letto-Lithuanians in the Baltic province\r\nof Courland, speaking the most primitive form of flectional languages\r\nclassed as Aryan. The isolation which preserved their archaic speech, of\r\nall European tongues the nearest to the Sanskrit, made them the last\r\nEuropean people to accept Christianity.[735] The great race of the\r\nSlavic Wends, who once occupied all northern Germany between the Vistula\r\nand Elbe, has left only a small and declining remnant of its language in\r\nthe swampy forests about the sources of the Spree.[736] [See\r\nethnographical map, p. 223.] The band of marshlands stretching through\r\nHolland from the shallow Zuyder Zee east to the German frontier, has\r\ngiven to Friesland and the coast islands of Holland a peculiar\r\nisolation, which has favored the development and survival of the\r\npeculiar Friesian dialect, that speech so nearly allied to Saxon\r\nEnglish, and has preserved here the purest type of the tall, blond\r\nTeuton among the otherwise mixed stock of the Netherlands.[737]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Swamps as places of refuge.]\r\n\r\nInaccessible to all except those familiar with their treacherous paths\r\nand labyrinthine channels, swamps have always afforded a refuge for\r\nindividuals and peoples; and therefore as places of defense they have\r\nplayed no inconspicuous part in history. What the Dismal Swamp of North\r\nCarolina and the cypress swamps of Louisiana were to the run-away\r\nslaves, that the Everglades of Florida have been to the defeated\r\nSeminoles. In that half-solid, half-fluid area, penetrable only to the\r\nnative Indian who poles his canoe along its tortuous channels of liquid\r\nmud, the Seminoles have set up their villages on the scattered hummocks\r\nof solid land, and there maintained themselves, a tribe of 350 souls,\r\ndespite all efforts of the United States government to remove them to\r\nthe Indian Territory. The swamps of the Nile delta have been the asylum\r\nof Egyptian independence from the time King Amysis took refuge there for\r\nfifty years during an invasion of the Ethiopians,[738] to the retreat\r\nthither of Amyrtaeus, a prince of Sais, after his unsuccessful revolt\r\nagainst the Persian conqueror Artaxerxes I.[739] The Isle of Athelney\r\namong the marshes of the Parret River afforded a refuge to Alfred the\r\nGreat and a band of his followers during the Danish invasion of Wessex\r\nin 878,[740] while the Isle of Ely in the Fenland was another point of\r\nsustained resistance to the invaders. It was the Fenland that two\r\nhundred years later was the last stronghold of Saxon resistance to\r\nWilliam of Normandy. Here on the Isle of Ely the outlawed leader\r\nHereward maintained Saxon independence, till the Conqueror at last\r\nconstructed a long causeway across the marshes to the \"Camp of\r\nRefuge.\"[741]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The spirit of the marshes.]\r\n\r\nThe spirit of the marshlands is the spirit of freedom. Therefore these\r\nsmall and scarcely habitable portions of the land assume an historical\r\ndignity and generate stirring historical events out of all proportion to\r\ntheir size and population. Their content is ethical rather than\r\neconomic. They attract to their fastnesses the vigorous souls protesting\r\nagainst conquest or oppression, and then by their natural protection\r\nsustain and nourish the spirit of liberty. It was the water-soaked\r\nlowlands of the Rhine that enabled the early Batavians,[742] Ditmarscher\r\nand Frieslanders to assert and to maintain their independence, generated\r\nthe love of Independence among the Dutch and helped them defend their\r\nliberty against the Spanish[743] and French. So the Fenland of England\r\nwas the center of resistance to the despotism of King John, who\r\ntherefore fixed his headquarters for the suppression of the revolt at\r\nLincoln and his military depôt at Lynn. Later in the conflict of the\r\nbarons with Henry III, Simon de Montfort and other disaffected nobles\r\nentrenched themselves in the islands of Ely and Axholm, till the\r\nProvisions of Oxford in 1267 secured them some degree of constitutional\r\nrights.[744] Four centuries later the same spirit sent many Fenlanders\r\nto the support of Cromwell.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Economic and political importance of lakes.]\r\n\r\nA river that spreads out into the indeterminate earthform of a marsh is\r\nan effective barrier; but one that gathers waters into a natural basin\r\nand forms a lake retains the uniting power of a navigable stream and\r\nalso, by the extension of its area and elimination of its current,\r\napproaches the nature of an enclosed sea. Mountain rivers, characterized\r\nby small volume and turbulent flow, first become navigable when they\r\ncheck their impetuosity and gather their store of water in some lake\r\nbasin. The whole course of the upper Rhone, from its glacier source on\r\nthe slope of Mount Furca to its confluence with the Saône at Lyon, is\r\nunfit for navigation, except where it lingers in Lake Geneva. The same\r\nthing is true of the Reuss in Lake Lucerne, the upper Rhine in Lake\r\nConstance, the Aare in Thun and Brienze, and the Linth in Lake Zurich.\r\nHence such torrent-fed lakes assume economic and political importance in\r\nmountainous regions, owing to the paucity of navigable waterways. The\r\nlakes of Alpine Switzerland and Italy and of Highland Scotland form so\r\nmany centers of intercourse and exchange. Even such small bodies of\r\nwater as the Alpine lakes have therefore become goals of expansion, so\r\nthat we find the shores of Geneva, Maggiore, Lugano, and Garda, each\r\nshared by two countries. Switzerland, the Austrian Tyrol, and the three\r\nGerman states of Baden, Wurtemberg and Bavaria, have all managed to\r\nsecure a frontage upon Lake Constance. Lake Titicaca, lying 12,661 feet\r\n(3854 meters) above sea level but affording a navigable course 136 miles\r\n(220 kilometers) long, is an important waterway for Peru and Bolivia. In\r\nthe central Sudan, where aridity reduces the volume of all streams, even\r\nthe variable and indeterminate Lake Chad has been an eagerly sought\r\nobjective for expanding boundaries. Twenty years ago it was divided\r\namong the native states of Bornu, Bagirmi and Kanem; today it is shared\r\nby British Nigeria, French Sudan, and German Kamerun. The erratic\r\nnorthern extension of the German boundary betrays the effort to reach\r\nthis goal.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lakes as nuclei of states.]\r\n\r\nThe uniting power of lakes manifests itself in the tendency of such\r\nbasins to become the nuclei of states. Attractive to settlement in\r\nprimitive times, because of the protected frontier they afford--a motive\r\nfinding its most emphatic expression in the pile villages of the early\r\nlake-dwellers--later because of the fertility of their bordering soil\r\nand the opportunity for friendly intercourse, they gradually unite their\r\nshores in a mesh of reciprocal relations, which finds its ultimate\r\nexpression in political union. It is a significant fact that the Swiss\r\nConfederation originated in the four forest cantons of Lucerne, Schwyz,\r\nUri and Unterwalden, which are linked together by the jagged basin of\r\nLake Lucerne or the Lake of the Four Forest Cantons, as the Swiss\r\nsignificantly call it, but are otherwise divided by mountain barriers.\r\nSo we find that Lake Titicaca was the cradle of the Inca Empire, just as\r\nLake Tezcoco was that of the Toltecs in Mexico and an island in Lake\r\nChalco later that of the Aztec domain.[745] The most stable of the\r\nshort-lived native states of Africa have apparently found an element of\r\nstrength and permanence in a protected lake frontier. Such are the petty\r\nkingdoms of Bornu, Bagirmi and Kanem on Lake Chad, and Uganda on\r\nVictoria Nyanza.\r\n\r\nLarge lakes, which include in their area islands, peninsulas, tides,\r\ncurrents, fiords, inlets, deltas, and dunes, and present every\r\ngeographical feature of an enclosed sea, approach the latter too in\r\nhistorical importance. Some of the largest, however, have long borne the\r\nname of seas. The Caspian, which exceeds the Baltic in area, and the\r\nAral, which outranks Lake Michigan, show the closest physical\r\nresemblance to thalassic basins, because of their size, salinity and\r\nenclosed drainage systems; but their anthropo-geographical significance\r\nis slight. The very salinity which groups them with the sea points to an\r\narid climate that forever deprives them of the densely populated coasts\r\ncharacteristic of most enclosed seas, and hence reduces their historical\r\nimportance. Their tributary streams, robbed of their water by irrigation\r\ncanals, like \"the shorn and parcelled Oxus\", renounce their function of\r\nhighways into the interior. To this rule the Volga is a unique\r\nexception. Finally, cut off from union with the ocean, these salt lakes\r\nlose the supreme historical advantage which is maintained by freshwater\r\nlakes, like Ladoga, Nyassa, Maracaibo and the Great Lakes of North\r\nAmerica, all lying near sea level.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lakes as fresh water seas.]\r\n\r\nLakes as part of a system of inland waterways may possess commercial\r\nimportance surpassing that of many seas. This depends upon the\r\nproductivity, accessibility and extent of their hinterland, and this in\r\nturn depends upon the size and shape of the inland basin. The chain of\r\nthe five Great Lakes, which together present a coastline of four\r\nthousand miles and a navigable course as long as the Baltic between the\r\nSkager Rack and the head of the Gulf of Bothnia, constitutes a\r\nfreshwater Mediterranean. It has played the part of an enclosed sea in\r\nAmerican history and has enabled the Atlantic trade to penetrate 1400\r\nmiles inland to Chicago and Duluth. Its shores have therefore been a\r\ncoveted object of territorial expansion. The early Dutch trading posts\r\nheaded up the Hudson and Mohawk toward Lake Ontario, as did the English\r\nsettlements which succeeded them. The French, from their vantage point\r\nat Montreal, threw out a frail casting-net of fur stations and missions,\r\nwhich caught and held all the Lakes for a time. Later the American\r\nshores were divided among eight of our states. The northern boundaries\r\nof Indiana and Illinois were fixed by Congress for the express purpose\r\nof giving these commonwealths access to Lake Michigan. Pennsylvania with\r\ngreat difficulty succeeded in protruding her northwestern frontier to\r\ncover a meager strip of Erie coast, while New York's frontage on the\r\nsame lake became during the period of canal and early railroad\r\nconstruction, a great factor in her development.\r\n\r\nIn 1901, the tonnage of our merchant vessels on the Great Lakes was half\r\nthat of our Pacific, Atlantic and Gulf coasts combined,[746]\r\nconstituting a freshwater fleet greater than the merchant marine of\r\neither France or sea-bred Norway. A remote but by no means faint echo of\r\nthis fact is found in the five hundred or more boats, equally available\r\nfor trade or war, which Henry M. Stanley saw the Uganda prince muster on\r\nthe shore of Victoria Nyanza Lake. Ocean, sea, bay, estuary, river,\r\nswamp, lake: here is Nature's great circle returning upon itself, a\r\ncircle faintly notched into arcs, but one in itself and one in man's\r\nuses.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n[630] Isabella B.

Owing to this proportion, the land-masses, which\r\nalone provide habitats for man, rise as islands out of the three-fold\r\nlarger surface of the uninhabitable ocean. Consequently, the human\r\nspecies, like the other forms of terrestrial life, bears a deeply\r\ningrained insular character. Moreover, the water causes different\r\ndegrees of separation between the land-masses, according as it appears\r\nas inlet, strait, sea, an island-strewn or islandless ocean; it\r\ndetermines the grouping of the habitable areas and consequently the\r\ngeographic basis of the various degrees of ethnic and cultural kinship\r\nbetween the divisions of land. Finally, since the sea is for man only a\r\nhighway to some ulterior shore, this geography of the land-masses in\r\nrelation to the encompassing waters points the routes and goals of human\r\nwanderings.\r\n\r\nEach fragment of habitable land, large or small, continent or islet,\r\nmeans a corresponding group or detachment of the vast human family. Its\r\nsize fixes the area at the service of the group which occupies it. Its\r\nlocation, however, may either endow it with a neighborliness like that\r\nsubsisting between Africa and Europe and involving an interwoven\r\nhistory; or remoteness like that of South America from Australia, so\r\ncomplete that even the close net of intercourse thrown by modern\r\ncommerce over the whole world has scarcely sufficed to bring them into\r\ntouch. Therefore the highly irregular distribution of the land areas,\r\nhere compactly grouped, there remote, deserves especial attention, since\r\nit produces far-reaching results. Finally, continents and islands, by\r\ntheir zonal situation, their land forms, rainfall, river systems, flora\r\nand fauna, produce for man varied life conditions, which in their turn\r\nare partially dependent upon the size and grouping of the land-masses.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Classification of land-masses according to size and\r\nlocation.]\r\n\r\nA comparison of the large and small land-masses of the from the\r\nstandpoint of both physical and anthropological geography yields a\r\nclassification based upon size and location on the one hand, and\r\nhistorical influences on the other. The following table indicates the\r\nrelation between the two.\r\n\r\n  I. Independent Land-masses.\r\n\r\n    A. _Continents_. Independent by reason of size, which enables them\r\n    to support a large number of people and afford the conditions for\r\n    civilization.\r\n\r\n      (a) Insular continents, whose primitive and modern development are\r\n      marked by remoteness. Australia.\r\n\r\n      (b) Neighboring continents, separated by narrow seas and showing\r\n      community of historical events. Europe and Africa. Asia and North\r\n      America around Bering Sea.\r\n\r\n    B. _Islands_. Independent by reason of location.\r\n\r\n      (a) Oceanic islands, characterized by greatest remoteness from\r\n      continents and other islands, and also by independent or detached\r\n      history. St. Helena and Iceland.\r\n\r\n      (b) Member of a group of oceanic islands, therefore less\r\n      independent. Hawaii, Fayal in the Azores, Tongatabu.\r\n\r\n      (c) Large islands, approaching by reason of size the independence\r\n      of continents and thereby finding compensation for a less\r\n      independent location. New Guinea, Borneo, Madagascar; in a cultural\r\n      sense, Great Britain and Japan.\r\n\r\n  II. Dependent Land-masses.\r\n\r\n    (a) Inshore or coast islands, whose history is intimately connected\r\n    with that of the nearby mainland. Euboea, Long Island, Vancouver,\r\n    Sakhalin, Ceylon.\r\n\r\n    (b) Neighboring islands, showing less intimate historical\r\n    relations. Formosa, the Canaries, Ireland in contrast to Great\r\n    Britain.\r\n\r\n    (c) Islands of enclosed or marginal seas, contained in a circle of\r\n    lands and exposed to constant intercourse from all sides. Jamaica,\r\n    Java, Crete, Sicily, Zealand, Gotland, St. Lawrence in Bering Sea.\r\n\r\n    (d) Island groups not to be considered apart from other groups.\r\n    Samoa, Fiji and Friendly Isles; Philippine, Sulu and Sunda Islands;\r\n    Greater and Lesser Antilles.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effect of size of land-masses.]\r\n\r\nAs the homes of man, these land-masses vary greatly owing to difference\r\nof size. Only the six continents have been large enough to generate\r\ngreat bodies of people, to produce differentiated branches of the human\r\nfamily, and to maintain them in such numerical force that alien\r\nintermixtures were powerless essentially to modify the gradually\r\ndeveloping ethnic type. The larger continents are marked by such\r\ndiversity of climate, relief and contour, that they have afforded the\r\nvaried environments and the area for the development of several great\r\ntypes or sub-types of mankind. Australia has been just large enough to\r\nproduce one distinct native race, the result of a very ancient blend of\r\nPapuan and Malayan stocks. But prevailing aridity has cast a mantle of\r\nmonotony over most of the continent, nullifying many local geographic\r\ndifferences in highland and lowland, curtailing the available area of\r\nits already restricted surface, and hence checking the differentiation\r\nthat results either from the competition of large numbers or from a\r\nvaried environment. We find Australia characterized above all other\r\ncontinents by monotony of culture, mode of life, customs, languages, and\r\na uniform race type from the Murray River to York peninsula.[747] The twin\r\ncontinents of the Americas developed a race singularly uniform in its\r\nphysical traits,[748] if we leave out of account the markedly divergent\r\nEskimos, but displaying a wide range of political, social and economic\r\ndevelopments, from the small, unorganized groups of wandering savages,\r\nlike the desert Shoshones and coast Fuegians, to the large, stable\r\nempire of the Incas, with intensive agriculture, public works, a state\r\nreligion and an enlightened government.\r\n\r\nEven the largest islands of the world, such as Borneo, New Guinea and\r\nMadagascar, show no such independent ethnic development. This is the\r\ndistinguishing characteristic of the largest land-masses. Europe, except\r\non the basis of its size and peninsula form, has no title to the name of\r\ncontinent; certainly not on anthropo-geographical grounds. Its\r\nclassification as a continent arose in the Mediterranean among the\r\nGreeks, as a geographical expression of the antagonism between\r\nthemselves and their Carian, Phoenician and Persian enemies across the\r\nAegean; the idea had therefore a political origin, and was formed\r\nwithout knowledge of that vast stretch of plains between the Black Sea\r\nand the Arctic Ocean, where Asia's climate and races lap over into\r\nEurope, and where to-day we find the Muscovite Empire, in point of\r\ngeographic conditions, its underlying ethnic stock and form of\r\ngovernment, as much Asiatic as European. The real or western Europe,\r\nwhich the Roman Empire gradually added to the narrow Europe of the\r\nGreeks, and which is strikingly contrasted to Asia in point of size,\r\nrelief, contour, climate and races, only served to maintain the\r\ndistinction between the two continents in men's minds. But from a\r\ngeographical standpoint the distinction is an error. It has confused the\r\ninterpretation of the history of the Greeks and the development of the\r\nRussians. It has brought disorder into the question of the European or\r\nAsiatic origin of the Aryan linguistic family, which the\r\nanthropo-geographer would assign to the single continent of Eurasia. The\r\nindependent development that falls to the lot of great world islands\r\nlike the Americas and Australia is impossible in a peninsular continent\r\nlike Europe, large as it is.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Independence of location versus independence of size.]\r\n\r\nThe independence of a land-mass is based not alone on size: there is\r\nalso an independence of location. This, owing to the spherical form of\r\nthe earth, tends to be neutralized by the independence based upon large\r\narea. The larger a land-mass is, the nearer it approaches to others.\r\nEurasia, the largest of all the continents, comes into close proximity\r\nand therefore close relations with Africa, North America, and even\r\nAustralia; whereas Australia is at once the smallest and the most\r\nisolated of the continents. The remote oceanic islands of the Atlantic\r\nOcean, measuring only a few square miles in area, have a location so\r\nindependent of other inhabited lands, that before the period of the\r\ngreat discoveries they had never appeared on the horizon of man.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The case of Asia.]\r\n\r\nAsia's size and central location to the other continents were formerly\r\ntaken as an argument for its correspondingly significant position in the\r\ncreation and history of man. Its central location is reflected in the\r\nhypothesis of the Asiatic origin of the Indo-European linguistic group\r\nof peoples; and though the theory has been justly called into question,\r\nthese peoples have undoubtedly been subjected to Asiatic influences.\r\nThe same thing is true of the native American race, both as to Asiatic\r\norigin and influences; because the approximation of Siberia to Alaska is\r\ntoo close to exclude human relations between the two continents. The\r\nMalays, too, were probably sprung from the soil of southeastern Asia and\r\nspread thence over their close-packed Archipelago. Even the native\r\nAustralians betray a Malayan and therefore Asiatic element in their\r\ncomposition,[749] while the same element can be traced yet more distinctly\r\nin the widely scattered Polynesians and the Hovas of Madagascar. This\r\nradiation of races seems to reflect Asia's location at the core of the\r\nland-masses. Yet the capacity to form such centers of ethnic\r\ndistribution is not necessarily limited to the largest continents;\r\nhistory teaches us that small areas which have early achieved a\r\nrelatively dense population are prone to scatter far their seeds of\r\nnations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Location of hemispheres and ethnic kinship.]\r\n\r\nThe continents harbor the most widely different races where they are\r\nfarthest apart; where they converge most nearly, they show the closest\r\nethnic kinships. The same principle becomes apparent in their plants and\r\nanimals. The distribution of the land-masses over the earth is\r\nconspicuous for their convergence in the north and divergence in long\r\npeninsular forms toward the south. The contrasted grouping is reflected\r\nin both, the lower animals and the peoples inhabiting these respectively\r\nvicinal and remote lands. Only where North America and Eurasia stretch\r\nout arms to one another around the polar sea do Eastern and Western\r\nHemisphere show a community of mammalian forms. These are all strictly\r\nArctic animals, such as the reindeer, elk, Arctic fox, glutton and\r\nermine.[750] This is the Boreal sub-region of the Holoarctic zoological\r\nrealm, characterized by a very homogeneous and very limited fauna.[751] In\r\ncontrast, the portion of the hemispheres lying south of the Tropic of\r\nCancer is divided into four distinct zoological realms, corresponding to\r\nCentral and South America, Africa south of Sahara, the two Indian\r\npeninsulas with the adjacent islands, and Australia.[752] But when we\r\nconsider the continental extremities projecting beyond the Tropic of\r\nCapricorn, where geographic divergence reaches a climax, we find their\r\nfaunas and floras utterly dissimilar, despite the fact that climate and\r\nphysical conditions are very similar.[753] We find also widely divergent\r\nraces in the southern sections of Africa, Australia or Tasmania and\r\nSouth America, while Arctic Eurasia and America come as near meeting\r\nethnically as they do geographically. Here and here only both Eastern\r\nand Western Hemisphere show a strong affinity of race. The Eskimo, long\r\nclassed as Mongoloid, are now regarded as an aberrant variety of the\r\nAmerican race, owing to their narrow headform and linguistic affinity;\r\nthough in Alaska even their headform closely approximates the Mongoloid\r\nSiberian type.[754] But in stature, color, oblique eyes, broad flat face,\r\nand high cheek bones, in his temperament and character, artistic\r\nproductions and some aspects of his culture, he groups with the Asiatic\r\nHyperboreans across the narrow sixty miles of water forming Bering\r\nStrait.[755] In the northern part of the earth's land area, the\r\ndistribution of floras, faunas, and races shows interdependence,\r\nintercourse; in the southern, separation, isolation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Continental convergence and ethnic kinship.]\r\n\r\nWhat is true where the hemispheres come together is true also where\r\ncontinents converge. The core of the Old World is found in the\r\nMediterranean basin where Europe, Asia and Africa form a close circle of\r\nlands and where they are inhabited by the one white Mediterranean race.\r\nContrast their racial unity about this common center with the extremes\r\nof ethnic divergence in their remote peripheries, where Teutons,\r\nMongols, Malays and Negroes differ widely from the Mediterranean stock\r\nand from each other. Eastern Australia represents the ethnic antipodes\r\nof western Asia, in harmony with the great dividing distance between\r\nthem, but the sides of these continents facing each other across the\r\nbridge of the Sunda Islands are sparsely strewn with a common Malay\r\nelement.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Africa's location.]\r\n\r\nAfrica's early development was never helped by the fact that the\r\ncontinent lay between Asia and South America. It was subjected to strong\r\nand persistent Asiatic Influences, but apparently to no native American\r\nones. From that far-off trans-Atlantic shore came no signs of life.\r\nAfrica appears in history as an appendage of Asia, a cultural peninsula\r\nof the larger continent. This was due not only to the Suez Isthmus and\r\nthe narrowness of the Red Sea rift, but to its one-sided invasion by\r\nAsiatic races and trade from the east, while the western side of the\r\ncontinent lay buried in sleep, unstirred by any voice from the silent\r\nshores of America. Semitic influences, in successive waves, spread over\r\nthe Dark Continent as far as Morocco, the Senegal, Niger, Lake Chad,\r\nNyanza, Tanganyika and Nyassa, and gave it such light as it had before\r\nthe 16th century. Only after the Atlantic gulf was finally crossed did\r\ninfluences from the American side of the ocean begin to impinge upon the\r\nWest African coast, first in the form of the slave and rum trade, then\r\nin the more humane aspect of the Liberian colony. But with the full\r\ndevelopment of the Atlantic period in history, we see all kinds of\r\nAtlantic influences, though chiefly from the Atlantic states of Europe,\r\npenetrating eastward into the heart of Africa, and there meeting other\r\ncommercial and political activities pressing inland from the Indian\r\nOcean.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Atlantic abyss.]\r\n\r\nThe long Atlantic rift between the Eastern and Western Hemispheres,\r\nwhich was such a potent factor in the primitive retardation of Africa\r\nis, from the standpoint of anthropo-geography, the most important\r\nfeature in the distribution of the land-masses over the globe. Not till\r\nthe discovery of America bridged this abyss did the known world become a\r\ngirdle round the earth. Except the Norse ventures to the American\r\ncontinent by way of Iceland and Greenland between 1000 and 1347, no\r\naccount of pre-Columbian intercourse between the two shores of the\r\nAtlantic has ever been substantiated. Columbus found the opposite land\r\nunfamiliar in race as in culture. He described the people as neither\r\nwhites nor blacks, the two ethnic types which he knew on the eastern\r\nside of the Atlantic abyss. He and his successors found in the Americas\r\nonly a Stone Age culture, a stage already outgrown by Europe and Africa.\r\nThese continents from Lapland to the Hottentot country were using iron.\r\nPrior to the voyage of the great Genoese, Europe gave nothing to America\r\nand received nothing from it, except the Gulf Stream's scanty cargo of\r\ndriftwood stranded on bleak Icelandic shores. The Tertiary land-bridge\r\nacross the North Atlantic between Norway and Greenland may possibly have\r\nguided a pre-Caucasic migration to America and given that continent part\r\nof its aboriginal population.[756] However, no trace of any European\r\nstock remains.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Atlantic islands uninhabited.]\r\n\r\nThe collapse of the bridge at the close of the Glacial Epoch left the\r\nAtlantic abyss effectually dividing the two hemispheres. Its islands,\r\nfew and far between, were helpless to maintain intercourse between the\r\nopposite shores; this is proven by the fact that all of them from\r\nGreenland to Tristan da Cunha, excepting only the Canaries, were\r\nuninhabited at the time of their discovery. History records when the\r\nfirst bold voyagers came upon them in that unmarked waste of waters, and\r\ngave them their first occupants. The political upheavals of Norway in\r\nKing Harfagr's time (872) sent to the Faroes and Iceland their first\r\nsettlers, though these islands were previously known to the Celts of\r\nIreland. The Norse colonists who went to Greenland in the year 1000 seem\r\nto have been the first regular settlers on those inhospitable coasts.\r\nThey found no native inhabitants, but numerous abandoned dwellings,\r\nfragments of boats and stone implements,[757] which doubtless recorded\r\nthe intermittent voyages thither of the Eskimo, preliminary to permanent\r\noccupation. The Scandinavians did not encounter natives on the island\r\ntill the 12th century, when Greenland probably received its first Eskimo\r\nimmigration.[758]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Geographical character of the Pacific.]\r\n\r\nWhile the Atlantic thus formed a long north-and-south rift across the\r\ninhabited world at the period of the great discoveries, the Pacific,\r\nstrewn with islands and land-rimmed at its northern extremity by the\r\npeninsulas of Alaska and eastern Siberia, spread a nebula of population\r\nfrom the dense centers of Asia across to the outskirts of America. The\r\ngeneral Mongoloid character of the American Indians as a race, the\r\nstronger Asiatic stamp of the Western Eskimo, the unmistakeable ethnic\r\nand cultural affinities of the Northwest Coast tribes both with southern\r\nPolynesians and Asiatics,[759] all point to America as the great eastern\r\nwing of the Mongoloid or Asiatic area, and therefore as the true Orient\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nGeographic conditions have made this possible or even probable. The\r\nwinds and currents of the North Pacific set from Japan straight toward\r\nthe American coast. Junks blown out to sea from China or Japan have been\r\ncarried by the Kuro Siwo and the prevailing westerlies across the\r\nPacific to our continent. There is record of a hundred instances of this\r\noccurrence.[760]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pacific affinities of North American Indians.]\r\n\r\nThe broken bridge across Bering Strait formed by East Cape, Cape Prince\r\nof Wales and the Diomede Islands between, and further south the natural\r\ncauseway of the Commander and Aleutian Islands leading from the\r\npeninsula of Kamchatka to that of Unalaska, have facilitated intercourse\r\nbetween Asia and America.[761] Justin Winsor says, \"There is hardly a\r\nstronger demonstration of such connection between the two continents\r\nthan the physical resemblances of the peoples now living on opposite\r\nsides of the Pacific Ocean in these upper latitudes.\"[762] This\r\nresemblance is by no means confined to the Eskimo and Chukches, who have\r\nexchanged colonists across Bering Sea. Recent investigations have\r\nrevealed a wider kinship. The population of northern Siberia speaks in\r\ngeneral Ural-Altaic languages, but it includes a few scattered tribes\r\nwhose singular speech excludes them from this linguistic group, and who\r\nhave therefore been placed by ethnologists in a distinct class called\r\n\"paleasiatics\" or \"hyperboreans.\" This class is composed of the Ostyak\r\nand Kot on the Yenisei River, the Gilyak and Ainos at the mouth of the\r\nAmur and on the Kurile, Sakhalin and Yezo islands, the Kamchadal and\r\nKoryak of Kamchatka, and the Chukches and Yukaghir of extreme\r\nnortheastern Siberia. As far back as 1850, the eminent philologist\r\nRobert Latham noted a marked linguistic agreement, both in structure and\r\nverbal affinity, between our Northwest Coast tribes and the peoples of\r\nthe islands and peninsulas fringing northeastern Asia. \"Koriak is\r\nnotably American,\" he said.[763] The recent Jesup Expedition to the\r\nNorthwest Coast of America and the nearby coast of Asia investigated the\r\nKoryak, to determine whether in the past there had been any connection\r\nbetween the cultures and ethnic types of the Old and New World. These\r\ninvestigations have proved beyond doubt a kinship of culture,\r\nattributable either to a remote common origin or to former contact, long\r\nand close, between these isolated Siberian tribes and the American\r\naborigines. They show that the Koryak are one of the Asiatic tribes\r\nstanding nearest to the northwestern American Indian.[764] [See map page\r\n103.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Polynesian affinities.]\r\n\r\nW.H. Dall finds the inhabitants of the Pacific slope of North America\r\nconspicuously allied with Oceanica in cultural achievements, whose\r\norigin he therefore assigns to that vast congeries of islands stretching\r\nfrom Asia toward South America in latitude 25° south. These islands,\r\nclosely clustered as far as the Paumota group, straggle along with\r\nwidening spaces between, through Easter Isle, which carries the\r\nindestructible memorials of a strange civilization, through\r\nSala-y-Gomez, San Felix, and St. Ambrose almost to the threshold of the\r\nPeruvian coast. It is to be noted that these islands lie just outside\r\nthe westward-bearing Equatorial Current and trade-winds, on the margin\r\nof the South Pacific anti-cyclonic winds and a southern current which\r\nsets towards the Peruvian coast.[765] A more probable avenue for the\r\nintroduction of these Polynesian or Malayan elements of culture is found\r\nin O.T. Mason's theory, that primitive mariners of the southwestern\r\nPacific, led into migration by the eternal food quest, may have skirted\r\nthe seaboard of East Asia and Northwest America, passing along a\r\ngreat-circle route through the succession of marginal seas and\r\narchipelagoes to various ports of entry on the Pacific front of America.\r\nSuch a route, favored by the prevailing marine currents and winds from\r\nthe southwest, and used repeatedly during long periods of time, might\r\nhave introduced trans-Pacific elements of race and culture into the\r\nwestern side of America.[766]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The real Orient of the World.]\r\n\r\nMoreover, primitive America resembled Oceanica and northern Asia in its\r\nignorance of iron, in its Stone Age civilization, and its retarded\r\nsocial and political development. Such affinities as it shows were\r\npredominantly Pacific or trans-Pacific.[767] On its Atlantic side, it\r\nstood out in striking contrast to the contemporaneous civilizations and\r\nraces in Europe and Africa; this was its unneighbored shore, lying on\r\nthe eastern margin of that broad zone of habitation which stretched\r\nhence westward on and on around the world, to the outermost capes of\r\nEurope and Africa. The Atlantic abyss formed the single gap in this\r\nencircling belt of population, to which Columbus at last affixed the\r\nclasp. The Atlantic face of the Americas formed therefore the drowsy\r\nunstirred Orient of the inhabited world, which westward developed\r\ngrowing activity--dreaming a civilization in Mexico and Peru, roused to\r\nartistic and maritime achievement in Oceanica and the Malay Archipelago,\r\nto permanent state-making and real cultural development in Asia, and\r\nattaining the highest civilization at last in western Europe. There was\r\nthe sunset margin of the inhabited world, the area of achievement, the\r\nadult Occident, facing across the dividing ocean that infant Orient\r\nbeyond. Here the Old World, the full-grown world, had accumulated in\r\nColumbus' time the matured forces of a hemisphere; it was searching for\r\nsome outlet across the shoreless distances of the Atlantic, waiting for\r\nsome call from its voiceless beyond.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Atlantic abyss in historic movements of peoples.]\r\n\r\nThis deep, unbridged chasm of the Atlantic, closed only four hundred\r\nyears ago, must be taken into account in all investigations of the\r\ngeographical distribution of races, whether in prehistoric or historic\r\ntimes. The influences of those ages when it formed an impassable gulf\r\nare still operative in directing the movements of the peoples to-day\r\ninhabiting its shores, because that barrier maintained the continents of\r\nAmerica as a vast territorial reserve, sparsely inhabited by a Stone Age\r\npeople, and affording a fresh field for the superior, accumulated\r\nenergies of Europe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Races and continents.]\r\n\r\nAustralia and the double continent of America show each the coincidence\r\nof an ethnic realm with an isolated continent. In contrast, when we come\r\nto the Old World triad of Europe, Asia and Africa, we find three races,\r\nto be sure, but races whose geographical distribution ignores the\r\nboundaries of the continents. The White race belongs to all three, and\r\nfrom time immemorial has made the central basin of the Mediterranean the\r\nwhite man's sea. The Mongolian, though primarily at home in Asia,\r\nstretches along the coast of the Arctic Ocean to the Atlantic shores of\r\nNorway, and in historical times has penetrated up the Danube to the foot\r\nof the Alps. Nor was the Negroid stock confined to Africa, though Africa\r\nhas always been its geographical core. The Indian Peninsula and Malay\r\nArchipelago, once peopled by a primitive Negroid race, but now harboring\r\nonly remnants of them in the Deccan, Malacca, the Philippines and\r\nelsewhere, bridge the distance to the other great Negroid center in\r\nMelanesia and the derivative or secondary Negroid area of\r\nAustralia.[768] The Negroid race belongs essentially to the long southern\r\nland pendants of the Eastern Hemisphere; and wherever it has bordered on\r\nthe lighter northern stocks, it has drawn a typical boundary zone of\r\nmingled tints which never diverges far from the Equator, from the\r\nAtlantic shores of the Sudan to Pacific Fiji.[769] [See map page 105.]\r\n\r\nThe effort of the old ethnology, as represented by Blumenbach, to make a\r\nfive-fold division of the races in agreement with the five continents\r\nwas a mistake. To distinguish between the continents is one thing and to\r\ndistinguish between the races is another. Neither bio-geography nor\r\nanthropo-geography can adopt the continents as geographical provinces,\r\nalthough floras, faunas and races the world over give evidence of\r\npartial or temporary restriction to a certain continent, whence they\r\nhave overflowed to other lands. A ground-plan for the geographical\r\nclassification of races is to be found, as Tylor says, in the fact that\r\nthey are not found scattered indiscriminately over the earth's surface,\r\nbut that certain races belong to certain regions, in whose peculiar\r\nenvironment they have developed their type, and whence they have spread\r\nto other lands, undergoing modifications from race intermixture and\r\nsuccessive changes of environment on the way.[770]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Contrast of the northern and southern continents.]\r\n\r\nFrom this general law of race movements it follows that certain groups\r\nof land-masses, favored by location and large area, play a great\r\nimperial rôle, holding other lands as appanages. The Eastern Hemisphere,\r\nas we have seen, enjoys this advantage over the Western. Still more the\r\nNorthern Hemisphere, blessed with an abundance of land and a predominant\r\nTemperate Zone location, is able to lord it over the Southern, so\r\ninsular in its poverty of land. The history of the Northern Hemisphere\r\nis marked by far-reaching historical influences and wide control; that\r\nof the Southern, by detachment, aloofness and impotence, due to the\r\nsmall area and isolation of its land-masses. A subordinate rôle is its\r\nfate. Australia will always follow in the train of Eurasia, whence alone\r\nit has derived its incentives and means of progress. Neither the\r\nsouthern half of Africa nor South America has ever in historical times\r\nstruck out a road to advancement unaided by its northern neighbors.\r\nPrimitive South America developed the only independent civilization that\r\never blossomed in the Southern Hemisphere, but the Peruvian achievements\r\nin progress were inferior to those of Mexico and Central America.[771]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Isolation of the southern continents.]\r\n\r\nThis subordination of the southern continents is partly due to the fact\r\nthat they have only one side of contact or neighborhood with any other\r\nland, that is, on the north; yet even here the contact is not close. In\r\nAustralia the medium of communication is a long bridge of islands; in\r\nAmerica, a winding island chain and a mountainous isthmus; in Africa, a\r\nbroad zone of desert dividing the Mediterranean or Eurasian from the\r\ntropical and Negroid part of the continent. Intercourse was not easy,\r\nand produced clear effects only in the case of Africa. Enlightenment\r\nfiltering in here was sadly dimmed as it spread. Moreover it was delayed\r\ntill the introduction from Asia of the horse and camel, which were not\r\nnative to Africa, and which, as Ratzel points out, alone made possible\r\nthe long journey across the Sahara. The opposite or peninsular sides,\r\nrunning out as great spurs from the compacter land-masses of the north,\r\nlook southward into vacant wastes of water, find no neighbors in those\r\nAntarctic seas. Owing to this unfavorable location on the edge of\r\nthings, they were historically dead until four centuries ago, when\r\noceanic navigation opened up the great sea route of the Southern\r\nHemisphere, and for the first time included them in the world's circle\r\nof communication. But even when lifted by the ensuing Europeanizing\r\nprocess, they only emphasize the fundamental dependence of the Southern\r\nHemisphere upon the superior geographical endowments of the Northern.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effect of continental structure upon historical development.]\r\n\r\nThe build of the land-masses influences fundamentally the movements and\r\nhence the development of the races who inhabit them. A simple\r\ncontinental structure gives to those movements a few simple features and\r\na wide monotonous distribution which checks differentiation. A manifold,\r\ncomplex build, varied in relief and ragged in contour, breaks up the\r\nmoving streams of peoples, turns each branch into a different channel,\r\nlends it a distinctive character through isolation, finally brings it up\r\nin a _cul de sac_ formed by a peninsula or mountain-rimmed basin, where\r\nfurther movement is checked and the process of local individualization\r\nbegins. Therefore great simplicity of continental build may result in\r\nhistorical poverty, as in the flat quadrangle of European Russia, the\r\nlevel plateau of Africa, and the smooth Atlantic slope of North America,\r\nwith its neatly trimmed outline. Complexity, abounding in contrasted\r\nenvironments, tends to produce a varied wealth of historical\r\ndevelopment. Africa lies on the surface of the ocean, a huge torso of a\r\ncontinent, headless, memberless, inert. Here is no diversity of outward\r\nform, no contrast of zonal location, no fructifying variety of\r\ngeographic conditions. Humanity has forgotten to grow in its stationary\r\nsoil. Only where the Suez Isthmus formed an umbilical cord uniting\r\nancient Egypt to the mother continent of Asia was Africa vitalized by\r\nthe pulse of another life. European influences penetrated little beyond\r\nthe northern coast.\r\n\r\nAsia, on the other hand, radiating great peninsulas, festooned with\r\nislands, supporting the vast corrugations of its highlands and lowlands,\r\nits snow-capped mountains and steaming valleys, stretching from the\r\nEquator through all the zones to the ice-blocked shores of the Arctic,\r\nknowing drought and deluge, tundra waste and teeming jungle, has offered\r\nthe manifold environment and segregated areas for individualized\r\ncivilizations, which have produced such far-reaching historical results.\r\nThe same fact is true of Europe, and that in an intensified degree. Here\r\na complex development of mountains and highlands built on diverse axes,\r\npeninsulas which comprise 27 per cent. and Islands which comprise nearly\r\n8 per cent. of the total area,[772] vast thalassic inlets cleaving the\r\ncontinent to the core, have provided an abundance of those naturally\r\ndefined regions which serve as cradles of civilization and, reacting\r\nupon the continent as a whole, endow it with lasting historical\r\nsignificance.[773] Even Strabo saw this. He begins his description of the\r\ninhabited world with Europe, because, as he says, it has such a\r\n\"polymorphous formation\" and is the region most favorable to the mental\r\nand social ennoblement of man.[774]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Structure of North and South America.]\r\n\r\nIn North and South America, great simplicity of continental build gave\r\nrise to a corresponding simplicity of native ethnic and cultural\r\ncondition. There is only one marked contrast throughout the length of\r\nthis double continent, that between its Atlantic and Pacific slopes. On\r\nthe Atlantic side of the Cordilleras, a vast trough extends through both\r\nland-masses from the Arctic Ocean to Patagonia; this has given to\r\nmigration in each a longitudinal direction and therefore constantly\r\ntended to nullify the diversities arising from contrasted zonal\r\nconditions. On the Pacific side of North America, there has been an\r\nunmistakeable migration southward along the accessible coast from Alaska\r\nto the Columbia River, and down the great intermontane valleys of the\r\nwestern highlands from, the Great Basin to Honduras;[775] while South\r\nAmerica shows the same meridional movement for 2,000 miles along the\r\nPacific coast and longitudinal valleys of the Andes system. There was\r\nlittle encouragement to cut across the grain of the continents. The\r\neastern range of the Cordilleras drew in general a dividing line between\r\nthe eastern and western tribes.[776] Though Athapascans from the east\r\noverstepped it at a few points in North America, the Great Divide has\r\nserved effectually to isolate the two groups from one another and to\r\ndraw that line of linguistic cleavage which Major Powell has set down in\r\nMs map of Indian linguistic stocks. Consequently, Americanists recognize\r\na distinct resemblance among the members of the North Atlantic group of\r\nIndians, as among those of the South Atlantic group; but they note an\r\nequally distinct contrast between each of them and its corresponding\r\nPacific group. Nor is this contrast superficial; it extends to physical\r\ntraits, temperament and culture,[777] and appears in the use of the\r\nvigesimal system of enumeration in primitive Mexico, Central America,\r\namong the Tlingits of the Northwest coast and the Eskimo as also among\r\nthe Chukches and Ainus of Asia, while in the Atlantic section of North\r\nAmerica the decimal system, with one doubtful exception, was alone in\r\nuse.[778]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cultural superiority of the Pacific slope Indians.]\r\n\r\nTo the anthropo-geographer, the significant fact is that all the higher\r\nphases of native civilization are confined to the Pacific slope group of\r\nIndians, which includes the Mexican and Isthmian tribes. From the\r\nelongated center of advanced culture stretching from the Bolivian\r\nhighlands northward to the Anahuac Plateau, the same type shades off by\r\neasy transitions through northern Mexico and the Pueblo country,\r\nvanishes among the lower intrusive stocks of Oregon and California, only\r\nto reappear among the Haidas and Tlingits of British Columbia and\r\nAlaska, whose cultural achievements show affinity to those of the Mayas\r\nin Yucatan.[779] Dall found certain distinguishing customs or\r\ncharacteristics spread north and south along the western slope of the\r\ncontinent in a natural geographical line of migration. They included\r\nlabretifery, tattooing the chin of adult women, certain uses of masks, a\r\ncertain style of conventionalizing natural objects, the use of\r\nconventional signs as hieroglyphics, a peculiar facility in carving wood\r\nand stone, a similarity of angular designs on their pottery and\r\nbasketry, and of artistic representations connected with their common\r\nreligious or mythological ideas. Many singular forms of carvings and the\r\nmethod of superimposing figures of animals one upon another in their\r\ntotem poles are found from Alaska to Panama, except in California. These\r\ndistinguishing features of an incipient culture are found nowhere else\r\nin North America, even sporadically. Dall therefore concludes that \"they\r\nhave been impressed upon the American aboriginal world from without,\"\r\nand on the ground of affinities, attributes their origin to\r\nOceanica.[780]\r\n\r\nCyrus Thomas, on the basis of the character and distribution of the\r\narcheological remains in North America, concurs in this opinion. He\r\nfinds that these remains fall into two classes, one east of the Rocky\r\nMountain watershed and the other west. \"When those of the Pacific slope\r\nas a whole are compared with those of the Atlantic slope, there is a\r\ndissimilarity which marks them as the products of different races or as\r\nthe result of different race influences.\" He emphasizes the resemblance\r\nof the customs, arts and archeological remains of the west coast to\r\nthose of the opposite shores and islands of the Pacific, and notes the\r\nlack of any resemblance to those of the Atlantic; and finally leans to\r\nthe conclusion that the continent was peopled from two sources, one\r\nincoming stream distributing itself over the Atlantic slope, and the\r\nother over the Pacific, the two becoming gradually fused into a\r\ncomparatively homogeneous race by long continental isolation. Yet these\r\ntwo sources may not necessarily include a trans-Atlantic origin for one\r\nof the contributing streams; ethnic evidence is against such a\r\nsupposition, because the characteristics of the American race and of the\r\narcheological remains point exclusively to affinity with the people of\r\nthe Pacific.[781] John Edward Payne also reaches the same conclusion,\r\nthough on other grounds.[782]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lack of segregated districts.]\r\n\r\nThe one strong segregating feature in primitive America was the\r\nCordilleras, which held east and west apart. In the natural pockets\r\nformed by the high intermontane valleys of the Andes and the Anahuac\r\nPlateau, and in the constricted isthmian region, the continent afforded\r\na few secluded localities where civilization found favorable conditions\r\nof development. But in general, the paucity of large coast\r\narticulations, and the adverse polar or subpolar location of most of\r\nthese, the situation of the large tropical islands along that barren\r\nAtlantic abyss, and the lack of a broken or varied relief, have\r\nprevented the Americas from developing numerous local centers of\r\ncivilization, which might eventually have lifted the cultural status of\r\nthe continents.[783]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Coast articulations of continents.]\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to distinguish two general classes of continental\r\narticulations; first, marginal dependences, like the fringe of European\r\npeninsulas and islands, resulting from a deeply serrated contour; and\r\nsecond, surface subdivisions of the interior, resulting from differences\r\nof relief or defined often by enclosing mountains or deserts, like the\r\nTibetan Plateau, the Basin of Bohemia, the Po River trough, or the\r\nsand-rimmed valley of the Nile. The first class is by far the more\r\nimportant, because of the intense historical activity which results from\r\nthe vitalizing contact with the sea. But in considering coast\r\narticulations, anthropo-geography is led astray unless it discriminates\r\nbetween these on the basis of size and location. Without stopping to\r\ndiscuss the obvious results of a contrasted zonal location, such as that\r\nbetween Labrador and Yucatan, the Kola Peninsula and Spain, it is\r\nnecessary to keep in mind always the effect of vicinal location. An\r\noutlying coastal dependency like Ireland has had its history\r\nimpoverished by excessive isolation, in contrast to the richer\r\ndevelopment of England, Jutland, and Zealand in the same latitude,\r\nbecause these have profited from the closer neighborhood of other\r\nperipheral regions. So from ancient times, Greece has had a similar\r\nadvantage over the Crimea, the Tunisian Peninsula of North Africa over\r\nSpain, the Cotentin Peninsula of France over Brittany, and Kent over\r\nCornwall or Caithness in Great Britain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Importance of size in continental articulations.]\r\n\r\nArticulations on a vast scale, like the southern peninsulas of Asia,\r\nproduce quite different cultural and historical effects from small\r\nphysical sub-divisions, like the fiord promontories and \"skerries\" of\r\nNorway and southern Alaska, or the finger peninsulas of the\r\nPeloponnesus. The significant difference lies in the degree of isolation\r\nwhich the two types yield. Large continental dependencies of the Asiatic\r\nclass resemble small continents in their power to segregate; while\r\novergrown capes like ancient Attica and Argolis or the more bulky\r\nPeloponnesus have their exclusiveness tempered by the mediating power of\r\nthe small marine inlets between them. Small articulations, by making a\r\ncoast accessible, tend to counteract the excessive isolation of a large\r\narticulation. They themselves develop in their people only minor or\r\ninner differentiations, which serve to enrich the life of the island or\r\npeninsula as a whole, but do not invade its essential unity. The\r\ncontrast in the history of Hellas and the Peloponnesus was due largely\r\nto their separation from one another; yet neither was able to make of\r\nits people anything but Greeks. Wales and Cornwall show in English\r\nhistory the same contrast and the same underlying unity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Historical contrast of large and small peninsulas.]\r\n\r\nIn discussing continental articulations, therefore, it makes a great\r\ndifference whether we draw our deductions from small projections of the\r\ncoast, like Wales, the Peloponnesus, Brittany and the Crimea, whose\r\nareas range from 7442 to 10,023 square miles (19,082 to 25,700 square\r\nkilometers); or the four Mediterranean peninsulas, which range in size\r\nfrom the 58,110 square miles (149,000 square kilometers) of the\r\nApennine Peninsula to the 197,600 square miles (506,-600 square\r\nkilometers) of Asia Minor and the 227,700 square miles (584,000 square\r\nkilometers) of the Iberian; or the vast continental alcoves of southern\r\nAsia, like Farther India with its 650,000 square miles (1,667,000 square\r\nkilometers), Hither India with 814,320 square miles (2,088,000 square\r\nkilometers) and Arabia with 1,064,700 square miles (2,730,000 square\r\nkilometers).[784] The fact that the large compound peninsula of western\r\nEurope which comprises Spain, Portugal, France, Jutland, Belgium,\r\nHolland, Switzerland, Italy and western Germany, and has its base in the\r\nstricture between the Adriatic and the Baltic, is about the size of\r\npeninsular India, suggests how profound may be the difference in\r\ngeographic effects between large and small peripheral divisions. The\r\nthree huge extremities which Asia thrusts forward into the Indian Ocean\r\nare geographical entities, which in point of size and individualization\r\nrank just below the continents; and in relation to the solid mass of\r\nCentral Asia, they have exhibited in many respects an aloofness and\r\nself-sufficiency, that have resulted in an historical divergence\r\napproximating that of the several continents. India, which has more\r\nproductive territory than Australia and a population not much smaller\r\nthan that of Europe, becomes to the administrators of its government\r\n\"the Continent of India,\" as it is regularly termed in the Statistical\r\nAtlas published at Calcutta. Farther India has in the long-drawn pendant\r\nof Malacca a sub-peninsula half as large again as Italy. The Deccan has\r\nin Ceylon an insular dependency the size of Tasmania. The whole scale is\r\ncontinental. It appears again somewhat diminished, in the largest\r\narticulations of Europe, in Scandinavia, the British Isles, the Iberian\r\nand Balkan peninsulas. This continental scale stamps also the\r\nanthropo-geography of such large individualized fields. They are big\r\nenough for each to comprise one or even several nations, and isolated\r\nenough to keep their historical processes for long periods at a time to\r\na certain extent detached from those of their respective continents.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Peninsular conditions most favorable to historical\r\ndevelopment.]\r\n\r\nThe most favorable conditions for historical development obtain where\r\nthe two classes of marginal articulation are combined, and where they\r\noccur in groups, as we find them in the Mediterranean and the North\r\nSea-Baltic basin. Here the smaller indentations multiply contact with\r\nthe sea, and provide the harbors, bays and breakwaters of capes and\r\npromontories which make the coast accessible. The larger articulations,\r\nby their close grouping, break up the sea into the minor thalassic\r\nbasins which encourage navigation, and thus insure the exchange of their\r\nrespective cultural achievements. In other words, such conditions\r\npresent the pre-eminent advantages of vicinal location around an\r\nenclosed sea.\r\n\r\nThe enormous articulations of southern Asia suffer from their paucity of\r\nsmall indentations, all the more because of their vast size and\r\nsub-tropical location. The Grecian type of peninsula, with its broken\r\nshoreline, finds here its large-scale homologue only in Farther India,\r\nto which the Sunda Islands have played in history the part of a gigantic\r\nCyclades. The European type of articulation is found only about the\r\nYellow-Japan Sea, where the island of Hondo and the peninsulas of\r\nShangtung and Korea reproduce approximately the proportions of Great\r\nBritain, Jutland and Italy respectively. Arabia and India, like the\r\nangular shoulder of Africa which protrudes into the Indian Ocean,\r\nmeasure an imposing length of coastline, but this length shrinks in\r\ncomparison with the vast area of the peninsulas. The contour of a\r\npeninsula is like the surface of the brain: in both it is convolutions\r\nthat count. Southern Asia has had lobes enough but too few convolutions.\r\nFor this reason, the northern Indian Ocean, despite its exceptional\r\nlocation as the eastward extension of the Mediterranean route to the\r\nOrient, found its development constantly arrested till the advent of\r\nEuropean navigators.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Length of coastline.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the peripheral articulations of a continent differ\r\nanthropo-geographically according to their size, their zonal and vicinal\r\nlocation, yet large and small, arctic and tropical, are grouped\r\nindiscriminately together in the figures that state the length of\r\ncoastlines. For this reason, statistics of continental coastlines have\r\nlittle value. For instance, the fact that Eurasia has 67,000 miles\r\n(108,000 kilometers) and North America 46,500 miles (75,000 kilometers)\r\nof contact with the ocean is not illuminating; these figures do not\r\nreveal the fact that the former has its greatest coastal length on its\r\ntropical and sub-tropical side, while the latter continent has wasted\r\ninlets and islands innumerable in the long, bleak stretch from\r\nNewfoundland poleward around to Bering Sea.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The continental base of the peninsulas.]\r\n\r\nPeninsulas are accessible from the sea according to the configuration of\r\ntheir coasts, but from their hinterland, according to the length and\r\nnature of their connection with the same. This determines the degree of\r\ntheir isolation from the land-mass. If they hang from the continent by a\r\nfrayed string, as does the Peloponnesus, Crimea, Malacca, Indian\r\nGutjerat, and Nova Scotia, they are segregated from the life of the\r\nmainland almost as completely as if they were islands. The same effects\r\nfollow where the base of a peninsula is defined by a high mountain\r\nbarrier, as in all the Mediterranean peninsulas, in the two Indias, and\r\nin Korea; or by a desert like that which scantily links Arabia to Egypt,\r\nSyria and Mesopotamia; or by a blur of swamps and lakes such as half\r\ndetaches Scandinavia, Courland, Estland and Finland from Russia.\r\n\r\nHeld to their continents by bonds that often fail to bind, subjected by\r\ntheir outward-facing peripheral location to every centrifugal force,\r\nfeeling only slightly the pull of the great central mass behind,\r\npeninsulas are often further detached economically and historically by\r\ntheir own contrasted local conditions. A sharp transition in geological\r\nformation and therefore in soil, a difference of climate, rainfall,\r\ndrainage system, of flora or fauna, serve greatly to emphasize the lack\r\nof community of interests with the continental interior, and therefore\r\nproduce an inevitable diversity of historical development.[785] Hence,\r\nmany peninsulas insulate their people as completely as islands. It is\r\nhard to say whether the Pyrenean peninsula or Sicily, Scandinavia or\r\nGreat Britain, has held itself more aloof from the political history of\r\nremaining Europe; whether Korea is not more entitled to its name of the\r\nHermit Kingdom than island Japan could ever be; whether the Peloponnesus\r\nor Euboea was more intimately associated with the radiant life of\r\nancient Hellas. These questions lead to another, namely, whether a high\r\nmountain wall like the Pyrenees, or a narrow strait like that of Messina\r\nis the more effective geographical boundary.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Continental base a zone of transition.]\r\n\r\nPeninsulas not infrequently gain in breadth as they approach the\r\ncontinent; here they tend to abate their distinctive character as lobes\r\nof the mainland, together with the ethnic and historical marks of\r\nisolation. Here they form a doubtful boundary zone of mingled\r\ncontinental and peninsular development. Such peninsulas fall naturally,\r\ntherefore, into a continental and a peninsular section, and reveal this\r\nsegmentation in the differentiated history of the two portions. That\r\ngreat military geographer Napoleon distinguished the Italy of the Po\r\nbasin as _Italie continentale_, and the Apennine section as\r\n_Presqu'ile_. Not only is the former broader, but, expanding like a tree\r\ntrunk near the ground, it sends its roots well back into the massive\r\ninterior of the continent; it is dominated more by the Alps than by the\r\nApennines; it contains a lowland and a river of continental proportions,\r\nfor which there is no space on the long, narrow spur of southern Italy.\r\nIf its geographical character approximates that of the mainland, so does\r\nits ethnic and historical. The Po basin is a well defined area of race\r\ncharacterization, in which influences have made for intermixture. South\r\nof the crest of the Apennines the Italian language in its purity begins,\r\nin contrast to the Gallo-Italian of the north. This mountain ridge has\r\nalso held apart the dark, short dolichocephalic stock of the\r\nMediterranean race from the fairer, taller, broad-headed Celts, who have\r\nmoved down into the Po basin from the Alps, and the Germans and\r\nIllyrians who have entered it from the northeast.[786] Northern Italy is\r\ntherefore allied ethnically, as it has often been united politically, to\r\nthe neighboring countries abutting upon the Alps, so that it has\r\nexperienced only in a partial degree that detachment which has stamped\r\nthe history of the Apennine section.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Historical contrast between base and extremity.]\r\n\r\nThe Balkan Peninsula tells much the same story of contrasted geographic\r\nconditions and development in its continental and peninsular sections.\r\nGreece proper, in ancient as in modern times, reached its northern\r\nconfines where the peninsula suddenly widens its base through Macedonia\r\nand Thrace. In this narrow southern section to-day, especially in\r\nisolated Peloponnesus, Attica, and the high-walled garden of Thessaly,\r\nare found people of the pure, long-headed, Hellenic type, and here the\r\nGreek language prevails.[787] But that broad and alien north, long\r\nexcluded from the Amphictyonic Council and a stranger to Aegean culture\r\nin classical times, is occupied to-day by a congeries of Slavs, who form\r\na southwestern spur of the Slav stock covering eastern Europe. Its\r\npolitical history shows how often it has been made a Danubian or\r\ncontinental state, by Alexander of Macedon, by the Romans, Bulgarians,\r\nand Ottoman Turks,[788] as it may be some day by Russia; and also how\r\noften its large and compact form has enabled it to dominate the tapering\r\npeninsular section to the south.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, the vast Ganges and Indus basins, which constitute the\r\ncontinental portion of India, have received various Tibetan, Scythian,\r\nAryan, Pathan, and Mongol-Tartar ingredients from Central Asia; and by\r\nreason of the dense populations supported by these fruitful river\r\nplains, it has been able to dominate politically, religiously and\r\nculturally the protruding triangle of the Deccan. [See maps pages 8 and\r\n102.] The continental side of Arabia, the Mesopotamian valley which ties\r\nthe peninsula to the highlands of Persia and Armenia, has received into\r\nits Semitic stock constant infiltrations of Turanian and Aryan peoples\r\nfrom the core of Asia. This process has been going on from the ancient\r\nElamite and Persian conquests of Mesopotamia down to the Ottoman\r\ninvasion and the present periodic visits of Kurdish shepherds to the\r\npastures of the upper Tigris.[789] Here we have the same contrast of\r\ngeographic conditions as in Italy and India, a wide, populous alluvial\r\nplain occupying the continental section of the peninsula, and a less\r\nattractive highland or mountainous region in the outlying spur of land.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Continental base a scene of invasion and war.]\r\n\r\nThese continental sections of peninsulas become therefore strongly\r\nmarked as areas of ethnic characterization and differentiated historical\r\ndevelopment. Their threshold location, by reason of which they first\r\ncatch any outward migration from the core of the continent, and their\r\nfertility, which serves as a perennial lure to new comers, whether\r\npeaceful or warlike, combine to give them intense historical activity.\r\nThey catch the come and go between their wide hinterland and the\r\nprojection of land beyond, the stimulus of new arrivals and fresh blood.\r\nBut tragedy too is theirs. The Po Valley has been called \"the cockpit of\r\nEurope.\" Even the little Eider, which marks the base of Jutland, has\r\nbeen the scene of war between Danes and Germans since the tenth\r\ncentury.[790] The Indus Valley has again and again felt the shock of\r\nconflict with invading hordes from the central highlands, and witnessed\r\nthe establishment of a succession of empires. Peace at the gates of the\r\nBalkan Peninsula has never been of long duration, and the postern door\r\nof Korea has been stormed often enough.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Peninsular extremities as areas of isolation.]\r\n\r\nIn contrast to these continental sections which stand in contact with\r\nthe solid land-mass behind, the extremities of the peninsulas are areas\r\nof isolation and therefore generally of ethnic unity. They often\r\nrepresent the last stand of displaced people pressed outward into these\r\nnarrow quarters by expanding races in their rear. The vast triangle of\r\nthe Deccan, which forms the essentially peninsular part of India, is\r\noccupied, except in the more exposed northwest corner, by the Dravidian\r\nrace which once occupied all India, and afterward was pushed southward\r\nby the influx of more energetic peoples.[791] Here they have preserved\r\ntheir speech and nationality unmixed and live in almost primitive\r\nsimplicity.[792] In the peninsular parts of Great Britain, in northern\r\nScotland. Wales and Cornwall, we find people of Celtic speech brought to\r\nbay on these remote spurs of the land, affiliating little with the\r\nvaried folk which occupied the continental side of the island, and\r\nresisting conquest to the last.[793] The mountainous peninsula of western\r\nConnaught in Ireland has been the rocky nucleus of the largest\r\nCeltic-speaking community in the island.[794] Brittany, with a similar\r\nlocation, became the last refuge of Celtic speech on the mainland of\r\nEurope,[795] the seat of resistance to Norman and later to English\r\nconquest, finally the stronghold of conservatism in the French\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ethnic unity of peninsulas.]\r\n\r\nThe northern wall of the Apennines and the outpost barrier of the Alps\r\nhave combined to protect peninsular Italy from extensive ethnic\r\ninfusions from the direction of the continent. This portion of the\r\ncountry shows therefore, as the anthropological maps attest, a striking\r\nuniformity of race. It has been a melting-pot in which foreign elements,\r\nfiltering through the breaches of the Apennines or along the southern\r\ncoast, have been fused into the general population under the isolating\r\nand cohesive influences of a peninsular environment.[796] The population\r\nof the Iberian Peninsula is even more unified, probably the most\r\nhomogeneous in Europe. Here the long-headed Mediterranean race is found\r\nin the same purity as in island Corsica and Sardinia.[797] Spain's short\r\nline of contact with France and its sharp separation by the unbroken\r\nwall of the Pyrenees robs the peninsula of any distinctly continental\r\nsection, and consequently of any transitional area of race and culture;\r\nhence the unity of Spain as opposed to that twofold balanced diversity\r\nwhich we find in Italy and India. The Balkan Peninsula, on the other\r\nhand, owing to the great predominance of its continental section and the\r\nconfused relief of the country, has not protected its distinctively\r\npeninsular or Greek section from the southward migrations of Slavs,\r\nAlbanians, Wallachians, and other continental peoples.[798] It has been\r\nlike a big funnel with a small mouth; the pressure from above has been\r\nvery great. Hellas and even the Peloponnesus have had their\r\npeninsularity impaired and their race mixed, owing to the predominant\r\ncontinental section to the north.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Peninsulas as intermediaries.]\r\n\r\nPeninsulas, so far as they project from their continents, are areas of\r\nisolation; but so far as they extend also toward some land beyond, they\r\nbecome intermediaries. The isolating and intermediary aspects can be\r\ntraced in the anthropo-geographical effects of every peninsula, even\r\nthose which, like Brittany and Cornwall, project into the long uncharted\r\nwaste of the Atlantic. In the order of historical development, a\r\npeninsula first isolates, until in its secluded environment it has\r\nmolded a mature, independent people; then, as that people outgrows its\r\nnarrow territory, the peninsula becomes a favorable base for maritime\r\nexpansion to distant lands, or becomes a natural avenue for numerous\r\nreciprocal relations with neighboring lands beyond. Korea was the bridge\r\nfor Mongolian migration from continental Asia to the Japan islands, and\r\nfor the passage thither of Chinese culture, whether intellectual,\r\nesthetic, industrial or religious.[799] It has been the one country\r\nconspicuous in the foreign history of Japan. Conquered by the island\r\nempire in 1592, it paid tribute for nearly three centuries and yielded\r\nto its foreign master the southeastern port of Fusan, the Calais of\r\nKorea.[800] Since the treaty of Portsmouth in 1905 made it subject to\r\nJapan, it has become the avenue of Japanese expansion to the mainland\r\nand the unwilling recipient of the modern civilization thrust upon it by\r\nthese English of the East. In like manner the Pyrenean peninsula has\r\nalways been the intermediary between Europe and northwest Africa. Its\r\npopulation, as well as its flora and fauna, group with those of the\r\nsouthern continent. It has served as transit land between north and\r\nsouth for the Carthaginians, Vandals and Saracens; and in modern times\r\nit has maintained its character as a link by the Portuguese occupation\r\nof the Tangiers peninsula in the fifteenth century,[801] and the Spanish\r\npossession of Ceuta and various other points along the Moroccan coast\r\nfrom the year 709 A.D. to the present.[802]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Peninsulas of intercontinental location.]\r\n\r\nThis rôle of intermediary is inevitably thrust upon all peninsulas\r\nwhich, like Spain, Italy, Greece, Asia Minor, Arabia, Farther India,\r\nMalacca, Chukchian Siberia, and Alaska, occupy an intercontinental\r\nlocation. Arabia especially in its climate, flora, races and history\r\nshows the haul and pull now of Asia, now of Africa. From it Asiatic\r\ninfluences have spread over Africa to Morocco and the Niger River on the\r\nwest, and to Zanzibar on the south, permeated Abyssinia, and penetrated\r\nto the great Equatorial Lakes, whether in the form of that Mecca-born\r\nworship of Allah, or the creeping caravans and slave-gangs of Arab\r\ntrader. Of all such intercontinental peninsulas, Florida alone seems to\r\nhave had no rôle as an intermediary. Its native ethnic affinities were\r\nwholly with its own continent. It has given nothing to South America and\r\nreceived nothing thence. The northward expansion of Arawak and Carib\r\ntribes from Venezuela in historic times ceased at Cuba and Hayti. The\r\nStraits drew a dividing line. Local conditions in Florida itself\r\nprobably furnish the explanation of this anomaly. Extensive swamps made\r\nthe central and southern portion of the peninsula inhospitable to\r\ncolonization from either direction, transformed it from a link into a\r\nbarrier.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Atlantic peninsulas of Europe]\r\n\r\nPeninsulas which conspicuously lack an intercontinental location must\r\nlong await their intermediary phase of development, but do not escape\r\nit. The Cornish, Breton and Iberian peninsulas were all prominent in the\r\ntrans-Atlantic enterprises of Europe from the end of the fifteenth\r\ncentury. The first French sailors to reach the new world were Breton and\r\nNorman fishermen. Plymouth, as the chief port of the Cornish peninsula,\r\nfigures prominently in the history of English exploration and settlement\r\nin America. It seems scarcely accidental that most of Queen Elizabeth's\r\ngreat sea captains were natives of this district--Sir Francis Drake, Sir\r\nJohn Hawkins, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, and Sir Walter Raleigh, the latter\r\nholding the office of vice-admiral of Cornwall and Devon. It was the\r\npeninsula-like projection of South America about Cape St. Roque, twenty\r\ndegrees farther east than Labrador, that welcomed the ships of Cabral\r\nand Americus Vespucius, and secured to Portugal a foothold in the\r\nWestern Hemisphere.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n[747] Ratzel, History of Mankind, Vol. I, p. 336.

A list of the chief peninsulas of the world, as compared\r\nwith the greatest islands, shows a far larger scale of areas for the\r\nformer, even if the latter be made to include the vast ice-capped\r\nland-mass of Greenland (2,170,000 square kilometers or 846,000 square\r\nmiles). New Guinea, the largest habitable island, has only one-fourth\r\nthe area of Arabia, the largest of the peninsulas.[803] Therefore, both\r\nthe advantages and disadvantages incident to a restricted area may be\r\nexpected to appear in an intensified degree in islands.\r\n\r\nPeninsulas are morphologically transition forms between mainland and\r\nislands; by slight geological changes one is converted into the other.\r\nGreat Britain was a peninsula at the end of the Tertiary period, before\r\nsubsidence and the erosion of Dover Channel combined to sever it from\r\nthe continent. It bears to-day in its flora and fauna the evidence of\r\nits former broad connection with the mainland.[804] In Pliocene times,\r\nSicily and Sardinia were united by a land bridge with the Tunisian\r\nprojection of North Africa; and they too, in their animal and plant\r\nlife, reveal the old connection with the southern continent.[805]\r\nSometimes man himself for his own purposes converts a peninsula into an\r\nisland. Often he constructs a canal, like that at Kiel or Corinth, to\r\nremove an isthmian obstruction to navigation; but occasionally he\r\ntransforms his peninsula into an island for the sake of greater\r\nprotection. William of Rubruquis tells us that in 1253 he found the neck\r\nof the Crimea cut through by a ditch from sea to sea by the native\r\nComanians, who had taken refuge in the peninsula from the Tartar\r\ninvaders, and in this way had sought to make their asylum more\r\nsecure.[806]\r\n\r\nThe reverse process in nature is quite as common. The Shangtung\r\nPeninsula rises like a mountainous island from the sea-like level of\r\nalluvial plains about it, suggesting that remote time when the plains\r\nwere not yet deposited and an arm of the Yellow Sea covered the space\r\nbetween Shangtung and the highlands of Shansi.[807] The deposition of\r\nsilt, aided often by slight local elevation of the coast, is constantly\r\ntying continental islands to the mainland. The Echinades Archipelago off\r\nthe southwest coast of ancient Acarnania, opposite the mouth of the\r\nAchelous River, Strabo tells us, was formerly farther from shore than\r\nin his time, and was gradually being cemented to the mainland by\r\nAchelous silt. Some islets had already been absorbed in the advancing\r\nshoreline, and the same fate awaited others.[808] Farther up this western\r\ncoast of Greece, the island of Leukas has been converted into a\r\npeninsula by a sickle-shaped sandbar extending across the narrow\r\nchannel.[809] Nature is working in its leisurely way to attach Sakhalin to\r\nthe Siberian coast. The strong marine current which sets southward from\r\nthe Okhotsk Sea through the Strait of Tartary carries silt from the\r\nmouth of the heavy laden Amur River, and deposits it in the \"narrows\" of\r\nthe strait between Capes Luzarev and Pogobi, building up sandbars that\r\ncome dangerously near the surface in mid channel.[810] Here the water is\r\nso shallow that occasionally after long prevailing winds, the ground is\r\nleft exposed and the island natives can walk over to Asia.[811] The close\r\nproximity of Sakhalin to the mainland and the ice bridge covering the\r\nstrait in winter rob the island of much of its insular character and\r\ncaused it to pass as a peninsula until 1852. Yet that five-mile wide\r\nstretch of sea on its western coast determined its selection as the\r\ngreat penal station of the Russian Empire. The fact that peninsular\r\nIndia accords in so many points of flora, fauna and even primitive\r\nethnic stock with Madagascar and South Africa, indicates its former\r\nisland nature, which has been geographically cloaked by its union with\r\nthe continent of Asia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Character of insular flora and fauna.]\r\n\r\nIslands, because of their relatively limited area and their clearly\r\ndefined boundaries, are excellent fields for the study of floral,\r\nfaunal, and ethnic distribution. Small area and isolation cause in them\r\npoverty of animal and plant forms and fewer species than are found in an\r\nequal continental area. This is the curse of restricted space which we\r\nhave met before. The large island group of New Zealand, with its highly\r\ndiversified relief and long zonal stretch, has only a moderate list of\r\nflowering plants, in comparison with the numerous species that adorn\r\nequal areas in South Africa and southwestern Australia.[812] Ascension\r\npossessed originally less than six flowering plants. The four islands of\r\nthe Greater Antilles form together a considerable area and have all\r\npossible advantages of climate and soil; but there are probably no\r\ncontinental areas equally big and equally favored by nature which are so\r\npoor in all the more highly organized groups of animals.[813] Islands\r\ntend to lop off the best branches. Darwin found not a single indubitable\r\ncase of terrestrial mammals native to islands situated more than three\r\nhundred miles from the mainland.[814] The impoverishment extends\r\ntherefore to quality as well as quantity, to man as well as to brute. In\r\nthe island continent of Australia, the native mammalia, excepting some\r\nbats, a few rodents, and a wild dog, all belong to the primitive\r\nmarsupial sub-class; its human life, at the time of the discovery, was\r\nrestricted to one retarded negroid race, showing in every part of the\r\nisland a monotonous, early Stone Age development. The sparsely scattered\r\noceanic islands of the Atlantic, owing to excessive isolation, were all,\r\nexcept the near-lying Canaries, uninhabited at the time of their\r\ndiscovery; and the Canary Islanders showed great retardation as compared\r\nwith their parent stock of northern Africa. [See map page 105.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Endemic forms.]\r\n\r\nDespite this general poverty of species, island life is distinguished by\r\na great proportion of peculiar or endemic forms, and a tendency toward\r\ndivergence, which is the effect of isolation and which becomes marked in\r\nproportion to the duration and effectiveness of isolation. Isolation, by\r\nreducing or preventing the intercrossing which holds the individual true\r\nto the normal type of the species, tends to produce divergences.[815]\r\nHence island life is more or less differentiated from that of the\r\nnearest mainland, according to the degree of isolation. Continental\r\nislands, lying near the coast, possess generally a flora and fauna to a\r\nlarge extent identical with that of the mainland, and show few endemic\r\nspecies and genera; whereas remote oceanic islands, which isolation has\r\nclaimed for its own, are marked by intense specialization and a high\r\npercentage of species and even genera found nowhere else.[816] Even a\r\nnarrow belt of dividing sea suffices to loosen the bonds of kinship.\r\nRecent as are the British Isles and near the Continent, they show some\r\nbiological diversity from the mainland and from each other.[817]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Paradoxical influences of island habitats upon man.]\r\n\r\nThe influence of an island habitat upon its human occupants resembles\r\nthat upon its flora and fauna, but is less marked. The reason for this\r\nis twofold. The plant and animal life are always the older and therefore\r\nhave longer felt the effects of isolation; hence they bear its stamp in\r\nan intensified degree. Man, as a later comer, shows closer affinity to\r\nhis kin in the great cosmopolitan areas of the continents. More than\r\nthis, by reason of his inventiveness and his increasing skill in\r\nnavigation, he finds his sea boundary less strictly drawn, and therefore\r\nevades the full influence of his detached environment, though never able\r\nwholly to counteract it. For man in lowest stages of civilization, as\r\nfor plants and animals, the isolating influence is supreme; but with\r\nhigher development and advancing nautical efficiency, islands assume\r\ngreat accessibility because of their location on the common highway of\r\nthe ocean. They become points of departure and destination of maritime\r\nnavigation, at once center of dispersal and goal, the breeding place of\r\nexpansive national forces seeking an outlet, and a place of hospitality\r\nfor wanderers passing those shores. Yet all the while, that other\r\ntendency of islands to segregate their people, and in this aloofness to\r\ngive them a peculiar and indelible national stamp, much as it\r\ndifferentiates its plant and animal forms, is persistently operative.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Conservative and radical tendencies.]\r\n\r\nThese two antagonistic influences of an island environment may be seen\r\nworking simultaneously in the same people, now one, now the other being\r\ndominant; or a period of undisturbed seclusion or exclusion may suddenly\r\nbe followed by one of extensive intercourse, receptivity or expansion.\r\nRecall the contrast in the early and later history of the Canaries,\r\nAzores, Malta, England, Mauritius and Hawaii, now a lonely,\r\nhalf-inhabited waste, now a busy mart or teeming way-station. Consider\r\nthe pronounced insular mind of the globe-trotting Englishman, the\r\ndeep-seated local conservatism characterizing that world-colonizing\r\nnation, at once the most provincial and cosmopolitan on earth. Emerson\r\nsays with truth, \"Every one of these islanders is an island himself,\r\nsafe, tranquil, incommunicable.\"[818] Hating innovation, glorifying their\r\nhabitudes, always searching for a precedent to justify and countenance\r\neach forward step, they have nevertheless led the world's march of\r\nprogress. Scattered by their colonial and commercial enterprises over\r\nevery zone, in every clime, subjected to the widest range of modifying\r\nenvironments, they show in their ideals the dominant influence of the\r\nhome country. The trail of the Oxford education can be followed over the\r\nEmpire, east to New Zealand and west to Vancouver. Highschool students\r\nof Jamaica take Oxford examinations in botany which are based upon\r\nEnglish plant life and ignore the Caribbean flora! School children in\r\nCeylon are compelled to study a long and unfamiliar list of errors in\r\nEnglish speech current only in the London streets, in order to identify\r\nand correct them on the Oxford papers, distributed with Olympian\r\nimpartiality to all parts of the Empire. Such insularity of mind seems\r\nto justify Bernard Shaw's description of Britain as an island whose\r\nnatives regard its manners and customs as laws of nature. Yet these are\r\nthe people who in the Nile Valley have become masters of irrigation,\r\nunsurpassed even by the ancient Egyptians; who, in the snow-wrapped\r\nforests of Hudson Bay, are trappers and hunters unequalled by the\r\nIndians; who, in the arid grasslands of Australia, pasture their herds\r\nlike nomad shepherd or American cowboy, and in the Tropics loll like the\r\nnatives, but somehow manage to do a white man's stint of work.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The case of Japan.]\r\n\r\nIn Japan, isolation has excluded or reduced to controllable measure\r\nevery foreign force that might break the continuity of the national\r\ndevelopment or invade the integrity of the national ideal. Japan has\r\nalways borrowed freely from neighboring Asiatic countries and recently\r\nfrom the whole world; yet everything in Japan bears the stamp of the\r\nindigenous. The introduction of foreign culture into the Empire has been\r\na process of selection and profound modification to accord with the\r\nnational ideals and needs.[819] Buddhism, coming from the continent, was\r\nJapanized by being grafted on to the local stock of religious ideas, so\r\nthat Japanese Buddhism is strongly differentiated from the continental\r\nforms of that religion.[820] The seventeenth century Catholicism of the\r\nJesuits, before it was hospitably received, had to be adapted to\r\nJapanese standards of duty and ritual. Modern Japanese converts to\r\nChristianity wish themselves to conduct the local missions and teach a\r\nnational version of the new faith.[821] But all the while, Japanese\r\nreligion has experienced no real change of heart. The core of the\r\nnational faith is the indigenous Shinto cult, which no later interloper\r\nhas been permitted to dislodge or seriously to transform; and this has\r\nsurvived, wrapped in the national consciousness, wedded to the national\r\npatriotism, lifted above competition. Here is insular conservatism.\r\n\r\nJapan's sudden and complete abandonment of a policy of seclusion which\r\nhad been rigidly maintained for two hundred and fifty years, and her\r\nentrance upon a career of widespread intercourse synchronously with one\r\nof territorial expansion and extensive emigration, form one of those\r\napparently irreconcilable contradictions constantly springing from the\r\nisolation and world-wide accessibility of an island environment; yet\r\nunderlying Japan's present receptivity of new ideas and her outwardly\r\nindiscriminate adoption of western civilization is to be detected the\r\ndeep primal stamp of the Japanese character, and an instinctive\r\ndetermination to preserve the core of that character intact.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Islands as nurseries and disseminators of distinctive\r\ncivilizations.]\r\n\r\nIt is this marked national individuality, developed by isolation and\r\naccompanied often by a precocious civilization, in combination with the\r\nopposite fact of the imminent possibility of an expansive unfolding, a\r\nbrilliant efflorescence followed by a wide dispersal of its seeds of\r\nculture and of empire, which has assigned to islands in all times a\r\ngreat historical rôle. Rarely do these wholly originate the elements of\r\ncivilization. For that their area is too small. But whatever seed ripen\r\nin the wide fields of the continents the islands transplant to their own\r\nforcing houses; there they transform and perfect the flower. Japan\r\nborrowed freely from China and Korea, as England did from continental\r\nEurope; but these two island realms have brought Asiatic and European\r\ncivilization to their highest stage of development. Now the borrowers\r\nare making return with generous hand. The islands are reacting upon the\r\ncontinents. Japanese ideals are leavening the whole Orient from\r\nManchuria to Ceylon. English civilization is the standard of Europe.\r\n\"The Russian in his snows is aiming to be English,\" says Emerson.\r\n\"England has inoculated all nations with her civilization, intelligence\r\nand tastes.\"[822]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ancient Cretan civilization.]\r\n\r\nThe recent discoveries in Crete show beyond doubt that the school of\r\nAegean civilization was in that island. Ancient Phoenicia, Argos, even\r\nMycenæ and Tiryns put off their mask of age and appear as rosy boys\r\nlearning none too aptly of their great and elderly master. Borrowing the\r\nseeds of culture from Asia and Egypt,[823] Crete nursed and tended them\r\nthrough the Neolithic and Bronze Age, transformed them completely, much\r\nas scientific tillage has converted the cotton tree into a low shrub.\r\nThe precocity of this civilization is clear. At early as 3000 B.C. it\r\nincluded an impressive style of architecture and a decorative art\r\nnaturalistic and beautiful in treatment as that of modern Japan.[824]\r\nFrom this date till the zenith of its development in 1450 B.C., Crete\r\nbecame a great artistic manufacturing and distributing center for stone\r\ncarving, frescoes, pottery, delicate porcelain, metal work, and\r\ngems.[825] By 1800 B. C., seven centuries before Phoenician writing is\r\nheard of, the island had matured a linear script out of an earlier\r\npictographic form.[826] This script, partly indigenous, partly borrowed\r\nfrom Libya and Egypt, gives Crete the distinction of having invented the\r\nfirst system of writing ever practised in Europe.[827]\r\n\r\nYet all this wealth of achievement bore the stamp of the indigenous;\r\nnearly every trace of its remote Asiatic or Egyptian origin was\r\nobliterated. Here the isolation of an island environment did thoroughly\r\nits work of differentiation, even on this thalassic isle which\r\nmaintained constant intercourse with Egypt, the Cyclades, the Troad and\r\nthe Greek peninsula.[828] Minoan art has a freshness, vivacity, and\r\nmodernity that distinguishes it fundamentally from the formal products\r\nof its neighbors. \"Many of the favorite subjects, like the crocus and\r\nwild goat, are native to the islands.... Even where a motive was\r\nborrowed from Egyptian life, it was treated in a distinctive way,\" made\r\ntender, dramatic, vital. \"In religion, as in art generally, Crete\r\ntranslated its loans into indigenous terms, and contributed as much as\r\nit received.\"[829] The curator of Egyptian antiquities in the New York\r\nMetropolitan Art Museum examined five hundred illustrations of second\r\nand third millenium antiquities from Gournia and Vasiliki in Crete, made\r\nby Mrs. Harriet Boyd Hawes during her superintendence of the excavations\r\nthere, and pronounced them distinctly un-Egyptian, except one vase,\r\nprobably an importation.[830] All this was achieved by a small insular\r\nsegment of the Mediterranean race, in their Neolithic and Bronze Age,\r\nbefore the advent of those northern conquerors who brought in an Aryan\r\nspeech and the gift of iron. It was in Crete, therefore, that Aegean\r\ncivilization arose. On this island it had a long and brilliant\r\npre-Hellenic career, and thence it spread to the Greek mainland and\r\nother Aegean shores.[831]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Limitation of small area in insular history.]\r\n\r\nA small cup soon overflows. Islands may not keep; they are forced to\r\ngive, live by giving. Here lies their historical significance. They\r\ndispense their gifts of culture in levying upon the resources of other\r\nlands. But finally more often than not, the limitation of too small a\r\nhome area steps in to arrest the national development, which then fades\r\nand decays. To this rule Great Britain and Japan are notable exceptions,\r\nowing partly to the unusual size of their insular territory, partly to a\r\nhighly advantageous location. Minoan Crete, in that gray antiquity when\r\nHomeric history was still unborn, gave out of its abundance in art,\r\ngovernment, laws and maritime knowledge to the eastern Mediterranean\r\nworld, till the springs of inspiration in its own small land were\r\nexhausted, and its small population was unable to resist the flood of\r\nnorthern invasion. Then the dispenser of gifts had to become an\r\nalms-taker from the younger, larger, more resourceful Hellenic world.\r\n\r\nThe same story of early but short lived preëminence comes from other\r\nAegean islands. Before the rise of Athens, Samos under the great despot\r\nPolykrates became \"the first of all cities, Hellenic or barbaric,\" a\r\ncenter of Ionian manners, luxury, art, science and culture, the seat of\r\nthe first great thalassocracy or sea-power after that of Cretan Minos, a\r\ndistributing point for commerce and colonies.[832] Much the same history\r\nand distinction attached to the island of Rhodes long before the first\r\nOlympiad,[833] and to the little island of Aegina.[834] If we turn to the\r\nnative races of America, we find that the Haida Indians of the Queen\r\nCharlotte Archipelago are markedly superior to their Tlingit and\r\nTsimshean kinsmen of the nearby Alaskan and British Columbian coast. In\r\ntheir many and varied arts they have freely borrowed from their\r\nneighbors; but they have developed these loans with such marvelous skill\r\nand independence that they greatly surpass their early masters, and are\r\naccredited with possessing the creative genius of all this coast.[835]\r\nFar away, on the remote southeastern outskirts of the island world of\r\nthe Pacific, a parallel is presented by little Easter Isle. Once it was\r\ndensely populated and completely tilled by a people who had achieved\r\nsingular progress in agriculture, religion, masonry, sculpture in stone\r\nand wood carving, even with obsidian tools, and who alone of all the\r\nPolynesians had devised a form of hieroglyphical writing.[836] Easter\r\nIsle to-day shows only abandoned fields, the silent monuments of its huge\r\nstone idols, and the shrunken remnant of a deteriorated people.[837]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sources of ethnic stock of islands.]\r\n\r\nIsolation and accessibility are recorded in the ethnic stock of every\r\nisland. Like its flora and fauna, its aboriginal population shows an\r\naffinity to that of the nearest mainland, and this generally in\r\nproportion to geographical proximity. The long line of deposit islands,\r\nbuilt of the off-scourings of the land, and fringing the German and\r\nNetherland coast from Texel to Wangeroog, is inhabited by the same\r\nFrisian folk which occupies the nearby shore. The people of the Channel\r\nIsles, though long subject to England, belong to the Franco-Gallic stock\r\nand the _langue d'oïl_ linguistic family of northern France. The native\r\nCanary Islanders, though giving no evidence of previous communication\r\nwith any continental land at the time of their discovery, could be\r\ntraced, through their physical features, speech, customs and utensils,\r\nto a remote origin in Egypt and the Berber regions of North Africa prior\r\nto the Mohammedan conquest.[838] Sakhalin harbors to-day, besides the\r\nimmigrant Russians, five different peoples--Ainos, Gilyaks, Orochons,\r\nTunguse, and Yakuts, all of them offshoots of tribes now or formerly\r\nfound on the Siberian mainland a few miles away.[839]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ethnic divergence with increased isolation.]\r\n\r\nWhere the isolation of the island is more pronounced, owing either to a\r\nbroader and more dangerous channel, as in the case of Madagascar and\r\nFormosa, or to the nautical incapacity of the neighboring coast peoples,\r\nas in the case of Tasmania and the Canary Islands, the ethnic influence\r\nof the mainland is weak, and the ethnic divergence of the insular\r\npopulation therefore more marked, even to the point of total difference\r\nin race. But this is generally a case of survival of a primitive stock\r\nin the protection of an unattractive island offering to a superior\r\npeople few allurements to conquest, as illustrated by the ethnic history\r\nof the Andaman and Kurile Isles.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Differentiation of peoples and civilizations on islands.]\r\n\r\nThe sea forms the sharpest and broadest boundary; it makes in the island\r\nwhich it surrounds the conditions for differentiation. Thus while an\r\ninsular population is allied in race and civilization to that of the\r\nnearest continent, it nevertheless differs from the same more than the\r\nseveral sub-groups of its continental kindred differ from each other. In\r\nother words, isolation makes ethnic and cultural divergence more marked\r\non islands than on continents. The English people, despite their close\r\nkinship and constant communication with the Teutonic peoples of the\r\nEuropean mainland, deviate from them more than any of these Germanic\r\nnations deviate from each other. The Celts of Great Britain and Ireland\r\nare sharply distinguished from the whole body of continental Celts in\r\nphysical features, temperament, and cultural development. In Ireland the\r\nprimitive Catholic Church underwent a distinctive development. It was\r\nclosely bound up in the tribal organization of the Irish people, lacked\r\nthe system, order and magnificence of the Latinized Church, had its\r\npeculiar tonsure for monks, and its own date for celebrating Easter for\r\nnearly three hundred years after the coming of St. Patrick.[840] The\r\nJapanese, in their physical and mental characteristics, as in their\r\nwhole national spirit, are more strikingly differentiated from the\r\nChinese than the agricultural Chinese from the nomadic Buriat shepherds\r\nliving east of Lake Baikal, though Chinese and Japanese are located much\r\nnearer together and are in the same stage of civilization. The Eskimo,\r\nwho form one of the most homogeneous stocks, and display the greatest\r\nuniformity in language and cultural achievements of all the native\r\nAmerican groups, have only one differentiated offshoot, the Aleutian\r\nIslanders. These, under the protection and isolation of their insular\r\nhabitat from a very remote period, have developed to a greater extent\r\nthan their Eskimo brethren of the mainland. The difference is evident in\r\ntheir language, religious ceremonies, and in details of their handiwork,\r\nsuch as embroidery and grass-fiber weaving.[841] The Haidas of the Queen\r\nCharlotte Archipelago show such a divergence in physique and culture\r\nfrom the related tribes of the mainland, that they have been accredited\r\nwith a distinct origin from the other coast Indians.[842]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Differentiation of language in islands.]\r\n\r\nThe differentiating influence is conspicuous in the speech of island\r\npeople, which tends to form a distinct language or dialect or, in an\r\narchipelago, a group of dialects. The Channel Isles, along with their\r\ndistinctive breeds of cattle, has each its own variant of the _langue\r\nd'oïl_.[843] According to Boccaccio's narrative of a Portuguese voyage to\r\nthe Canaries in 1341, the natives of one island could not understand\r\nthose from another, so different were their languages. The statement was\r\nrepeated by a later authority in 1455 in regard to the inhabitants of\r\nLancerote, Fuerteventura, Gomera and Ferro, who had then been\r\nChristianized. A partial explanation is supplied by the earlier\r\nvisitors, who found the Canary Guanches with no means of communication\r\nbetween the several islands except by swimming.[844] In the Visayan group\r\nof the Philippines, inhabited exclusively by the civilized Visayan\r\ntribes except for the Negritos in the mountainous interior, the people\r\nof Cebu can not understand their brethren in the adjacent islands; in\r\nCuyos and Calmanianes, dialects of the Visayan are spoken.[845] [See map\r\npage 147.]\r\n\r\nThe differentiation of language from the nearby continental speech may\r\nbe due to a higher development, especially on large islands affording\r\nvery advantageous conditions, such as Great Britain and Japan. Japanese\r\nspeech has some affinity with the great Altaic linguistic family, but no\r\nclose resemblance to any sub-group.[846] It presents marked contrasts to\r\nthe Chinese because it has passed beyond the agglutinative stage of\r\ndevelopment, just as English has sloughed off more of its inflectional\r\nforms than the continental Teutonic languages.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Archaic forms of speech in islands.]\r\n\r\nMore often the difference is due to the survival of archaic forms of\r\nspeech. This is especially the case on very small or remote islands,\r\nwhose limited area or extreme isolation or both factors in conjunction\r\npresent conditions for retardation. The speech of the Sardinians has a\r\nstrong resemblance to the ancient Latin, retains many inflectional forms\r\nnow obsolete in the continental Romance languages; but it has also been\r\nenlivened by an infusion of Catalan words, which came in by the bridge\r\nof the Balearic Islands during the centuries of Spanish rule in\r\nSardinia.[847] Again, it is in Minorca and Majorca that this Catalan\r\nspeech is found in its greatest purity to-day. On its native soil in\r\neastern Spain, especially in Barcelona, it is gradually succumbing to\r\nthe official Castilian, and probably in a few centuries will be found\r\nsurviving only in the protected environment of the Balearic Isles.\r\nIcelandic and the kindred dialects of the Shetland and Faroe Islands had\r\ntheir origin in the classic Norse of the ninth century, and are\r\ndivergent forms of the speech of the Viking explorers.[848] The old\r\nFrisian tongue of Holland, sister speech to Anglo-Saxon, survives to-day\r\nonly in West Friesland beyond the great marshlands, and in the\r\nlong-drawn belt of coastal islands from Terschelling through Helgoland\r\nto Sylt, as also on the neighboring shores of Schleswig-Holstein.[849]\r\nThis region of linguistic survival, insulated partially by the marshes\r\nor completely by the shallow \"Wattenmeer\" of this lowland coast, reminds\r\nus of the protracted life of the archaic Lithuanian speech within a\r\ncircle of sea and swamp in Baltic Russia, and the survival of the Celtic\r\ntongue in peninsular Brittany, Cornwall, Wales, in Ireland, and the\r\nHighlands and islands of Scotland.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Unification of race in islands.]\r\n\r\nIslanders are always coast dwellers with a limited hinterland. Hence\r\ntheir stock may be differentiated from the mainland race in part for the\r\nsame reason that all coastal folk in regions of maritime development are\r\ndifferentiated from the people of the back country, namely, because\r\ncontact with the sea allows an intermittent influx of various foreign\r\nstrains, which are gradually assimilated. This occasional ethnic\r\nintercrossing can be proved in greater or less degree of all island\r\npeople. Here is accessibility operating against the underlying isolation\r\nof an island habitat. The English to-day represent a mixture of Celts\r\nwith various distinct Teutonic elements, which had already diverged from\r\none another in their separate habitats--Jutes, Angles, Saxons, Danes,\r\nNorse and Norman French. The subsequent detachment of these immigrant\r\nstocks by the English Channel and North Sea from their home people, and\r\ntheir arrival in necessarily small bands enabled them to be readily\r\nassimilated, a process which was stimulated further by the rapid\r\nincrease of population, the intimate interactive life and unification of\r\nculture which characterizes all restricted areas. Hence islands, like\r\npeninsulas, despite ethnic admixtures, tend to show a surprising\r\nunification of race; they hold their people aloof from others and hold\r\nthem in a close embrace, shut them off and shut them in, tend to force\r\nthe amalgamation of race, culture and speech. Moreover, their relatively\r\nsmall area precludes effective segregation within their own borders,\r\nexcept where a mountainous or jungle district affords a temporary refuge\r\nfor a displaced and antagonized tribe. Hence there arises a\r\npreponderance of the geographic over the ethnic and linguistic factors\r\nin the historical equation.\r\n\r\nThe uniformity in cranial type prevailing all over the British Isles is\r\namazing; it is greater than in either Spain or Scandinavia. The cephalic\r\nindices range chiefly between 77 and 79, a restricted variation as\r\ncompared with the ten points which represents the usual range for\r\nCentral Europe, and the thirteen between the extremes of 75 and 88 found\r\nin France and Italy.[850] Japan stands in much the same ethnic relation\r\nto Asia as Britain to Europe. She has absorbed Aino, Mongolian, Malay\r\nand perhaps Polynesian elements, but by reason of her isolation has been\r\nleft free to digest these at her leisure, so that her population is\r\nfairly well assimilated, though evidences of the old mixture can be\r\ndiscerned.[851] In Corsica and Sardinia a particularly low cephalic\r\nindex, dropping in some communes to 73, and a particularly short stature\r\npoint to a rare purity of the Mediterranean race,[852] and indicate the\r\nmaintenance here of one ethnic type, despite the intermittent intrusion\r\nof various less pure stocks from the Italian mainland, Africa,\r\nPhoenicia, Arabia, and Spain. The location of the islands off the main\r\nroutes of the basin, their remoteness from shore, and the strong spirit\r\nof exclusiveness native to the people,[853] bred doubtless from their\r\nisolation, have combined to reduce the amount of foreign intermixture.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Remoter sources of island populations.]\r\n\r\nIslands do not\r\nnecessarily derive their population from the land that lies nearest to\r\nthem. A comparatively narrow strait may effectively isolate, if the\r\nopposite shore is inhabited by a nautically inefficient race; whereas a\r\nwide stretch of ocean may fail to bar the immigration of a seafaring\r\npeople. Here we find a parallel to the imperfect isolation of oceanic\r\nislands for life forms endowed with superior means of dispersal, such as\r\nmarine birds, bats and insects.[854] Iceland, though relatively near\r\nGreenland, was nevertheless peopled by far away Scandinavians. These\r\nbold sailors planted their settlements even in Greenland nearly two\r\ncenturies before the Eskimo. England received the numerically dominant\r\nelement of its population from across the wide expanse of the North Sea,\r\nfrom the bare but seaman-breeding coasts of Germany, Denmark and Norway,\r\nrather than from the nearer shores of Gaul. So the Madeira and Cape\r\nVerde Isles had to wait for the coming of the nautical Portuguese to\r\nsupply them with a population; and only later, owing to the demand for\r\nslave labor, did they draw upon the human stock of nearby Africa, but\r\neven then by means of Portuguese ships.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Double sources.]\r\n\r\nOwing to the power of navigation to bridge the intervening spaces of\r\nwater and hence to emphasize the accessibility rather than the isolation\r\nof these outlying fragments of land, we often find islands facing two or\r\nthree ways, as it were, tenanted on different sides by different races,\r\nand this regardless of the width of the intervening seas, where the\r\nremote neighbors excel in nautical skill. Formosa is divided between its\r\nwild Malay aborigines, found on the eastern, mountainous side of the\r\nisland, and Chinese settlers who cultivate the wide alluvial plain on\r\nthe western side.[855] Fukien Strait, though only eighty miles wide,\r\nsufficed to bar Formosa to the land-loving northern Chinese till 1644,\r\nwhen the island became an asylum for refugees from the Manchu invaders;\r\nbut long before, the wider stretches of sea to the south and north were\r\nmere passways for the sea-faring Malays, who were the first to people\r\nthe island, and the Japanese who planted considerable colonies on its\r\nnorthern coasts at the beginning of the fifteenth century. [See map page\r\n103.]\r\n\r\nIn a similar way Madagascar is divided between the Malayan Hovas, who\r\noccupy the eastern and central part of the island, and the African\r\nSakalavas who border the western coast. [See map page 105.] This\r\ndistribution of the ethnic elements corresponds to that of the insect\r\nlife, which is more African on the western side and more Indo-Malayan on\r\nthe eastern.[856] Though the population shows every physical type between\r\nNegro and Malayan, and ethnic diversity still predominates over ethnic\r\nunity in this vast island, nevertheless the close intercourse of an\r\nisland habitat has even in Madagascar produced unification of language.\r\nMalayan speech of an ancient form prevails everywhere, and though\r\ndiversified into dialects, is everywhere so much alike that all\r\nMalagasies can manage to understand one another.[857] The first\r\ninhabitants were probably African; but the wide Mozambique Current (230\r\nmiles), with its strong southward flow, was a serious barrier to fresh\r\naccessions from the mainland, especially as the nautical development of\r\nthe African tribes was always low. Meanwhile, however, successive relays\r\nof sea-bred Malay-Polynesians crossed the broad stretch of the Indian\r\nOcean, occupied the island, and finally predominated over the original\r\nNegro stock.[858] Then in historic times came Arabs, Swahilis, and East\r\nIndians to infuse an Asiatic element into the population of the coasts,\r\nwhile Portuguese, English, Dutch, and French set up short-lived colonies\r\non its shores. But despite this intermittent foreign immigration, the\r\nfundamental isolation of Madagascar, combined with its large area,\r\nenabled it to go its own slow historical gait, with a minimum of\r\ninterference from outside, till France in 1895 began to assume control\r\nof the island.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mixed population of small thalassic isles.]\r\n\r\nSmall thalassic islands, at an early date in their history, lose their\r\nethnic unity and present a highly mixed population. The reasons for this\r\nare two. The early maritime development characterizing enclosed seas\r\ncovers them with a network of marine routes, on which such islands serve\r\nas way stations and mid-sea markets for the surrounding shores. Sailors\r\nand traders, colonists and conquerors flock to them from every side.\r\nSuch a nodal location on commercial routes insures to islands a\r\ncosmopolitanism of race, as opposed to the ethnic differentiation and\r\nunity which follows an outlying or oceanic situation. Here the factor of\r\nmany-sided accessibility predominates over isolation.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing small area of such thalassic islands, moreover, involves\r\na population so small that it is highly susceptible to the effects of\r\nintercrossing. Too restricted to absorb the constant influx of foreign\r\nelements, the inhabitants tend to become a highly mixed, polyglot breed.\r\nThis they continue to be by the constant addition of foreign strains, so\r\nlong as the islands remain foci of trade or strategic points for the\r\ncontrol of the marine highways. Diomede Island in Bering Strait is the\r\ngreat market place of the polar tribes. Here Siberian Chukches and\r\nAlaskan Eskimos make their exchanges. The Eskimo of St. Lawrence Island\r\nin Bering Sea, from long intercourse, have adopted certain articles of\r\ndress, the boats and part of the vocabulary of the Chukches.[859]\r\nKilwauru, located on a sand-bank at the eastern end of Ceram, on the\r\nborder between Malayan and Papuan island districts, is the metropolis of\r\nnative traders in the Far East. Here gather the _praus_ of the\r\nsea-faring Bugis bringing manufactured goods from Singapore, and boats\r\nladen with the natural products of New Guinea.[860] The smaller these\r\nisland marts and the wider their circle of trade, the more mixed is\r\ntheir population. Thursday Isle, an English coaling-station in Torres\r\nStrait, is a port of call for all steamers bound from Europe or China\r\nfor east Australian ports, besides being a center of a big local trade\r\nin pearl shell and tripang. Hence its population of 526 souls comprises\r\n270 Europeans of various nationalities, including British, Germans,\r\nScandinavians, Danes, Spanish, Portuguese, French and Australians of\r\nEuropean origin, besides 256 South Sea Islanders, Papuans, Africans,\r\nPhilippines, Chinese and other Asiatics.[861]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mixed population of island markets.]\r\n\r\nAntiquity shows the same thing on a smaller scale, which grew, however,\r\nwith the expansion of the circle of commerce. Ancient Aegina in the\r\nSaronic Gulf received inhabitants from Crete, Argos, Epidaurus in\r\neastern Argolis and Athens; it became a central maritime market and its\r\npeople sea-traders, whose goods of a certain small kind became known as\r\n\"Aegina wares.\"[862] Delos at the crossroads of the Aegean was the center\r\nof longer radii. It became the inn for travelers and merchants sailing\r\nfrom Asia and Egypt to Italy and Greece, and hence drew to itself the\r\ntrade and people of the whole Mediterranean basin.[863] The northwestern\r\nIndian Ocean had a similar emporium in the ancient Dioscoridis,\r\n(Sokotra) which focused on itself the trade between Arabia and eastern\r\nAfrica.[864]\r\n\r\nCeylon's location made it in ancient and medieval times the common\r\nmeeting place for Arab traders from the west and Chinese merchants from\r\nthe east; it thus became the Sicily of the semi-enclosed North Indian\r\nOcean. To-day its capital Colombo is \"the Clapham Junction of the Eastern\r\nSeas,\" where passengers change steamers for China, India and Australia;\r\na port of call for vessels passing from the Straits of Malacca to the\r\nPersian Gulf or Mediterranean. Hence Ceylon's solid nucleus of\r\nSinghalese and Tamil population, protected against absorption by the\r\nlarge area of the island (25,365 square miles) is interspersed in the\r\ncoastal districts with Arabs, Portuguese, Eurasians dating from the old\r\nPortuguese occupation, and some ten thousand Europeans.[865] The island\r\nof Gotland, located at the crossroads of the Baltic, was early adopted\r\nby the Hanseatic merchants as their maritime base for the exploitation\r\nof Swedish, Finnish, and Russian trade. Here were \"peoples of divers\r\ntongues,\" so the old chronicles say, while the archeological finds of\r\nByzantine, Cufic, Roman, Anglo-Saxon and German coins testify to the\r\nwide circle of trade whose radii focused at this nodal point of the\r\nBaltic.[866]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Significant location of island way stations.]\r\n\r\nThe great importance of such islands has been due solely to their\r\nlocation. Their size and resources are negligible quantities, but their\r\nnatural position as way stations lent them preeminence so long as\r\nnavigation held to short \"laps,\" and was restricted to enclosed seas. In\r\nthe wide expanse of the open ocean, similar sparsely scattered isles,\r\nlike Ascension, St. Helena, the Canaries and Hawaii, assumed importance\r\nin proportion to their scarcity. Though never the centers of rife\r\nintercourse like Delos and Gotland, those lying conspicuously in the\r\ntrack of commerce have succeeded in drawing to themselves the typical\r\npolyglot nodal population. Mauritius, located at the southwestern\r\nentrance of the Indian Ocean about equally distant from Aden, Ceylon,\r\nBombay, Singapore and West Australia, and possessing the best harbor\r\nwithin many hundred miles, has been held successively by Dutch, French\r\nand English, and to-day has a dense population of French, English and\r\nHindus.[867] A situation at the northeast entrance to the Caribbean Sea,\r\nkeystone of the vast arch formed by the Greater and Lesser Antilles,\r\nmade the island of St. Thomas a natural distributing point for this\r\nwhole basin. Facing that much traveled Virgin Passage, and forming the\r\nfirst objective of vessels bound from Europe to Panama, it became a\r\ngreat ship rendezvous, and assumed strategic and commercial importance\r\nfrom early times. We find the same political owners here as in Mauritius\r\nand in the same order--Dutch, French and English, though in 1671 the\r\nisland was occupied by the Danes, then from 1807 to 1815 by the English\r\nagain, and finally secured by the Danes.[868] The history of the Falkland\r\nIslands is a significant reflection of their location on the south\r\noceanic trade route, where they command the entrance to the Magellan\r\nStraits and the passage round the Horn, Here on the outskirts of the\r\nworld, where they form the only break in the wide blank surface of the\r\nSouth Atlantic, they have been coveted and held in turn by the chief\r\nEuropean powers having colonies in the Orient,--by France, Spain,\r\nEngland, Spain again, England again, by Argentine in 1820, and finally\r\nby England since 1833. Their possession was of especial advantage to\r\nGreat Britain, which had no other base in this part of the world\r\nintermediate between England and New Zealand.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Thalassic islands as goals of expansion.]\r\n\r\nIslands located in enclosed seas display the transitional character of\r\nborder districts. They are outposts of the surrounding shores, and\r\nbecome therefore the first objective of every expanding movement,\r\nwhether commercial or political, setting out from the adjacent coasts.\r\nSuch islands are swept by successive waves of conquest or colonization,\r\nand they carry in their people and language evidences of the wrack left\r\nbehind on their shores. This has been the history of Aegina, Cyprus,\r\nRhodes, Crete, Malta, Corfu, Sicily and Sardinia. That of Cyprus is\r\ntypical. It was the first island base for the ancient Tyrian fleets, and\r\nhad its Phoenician settlements in 1045 B. C. From that time it was one\r\nof the many prizes in the Mediterranean grab-bag for the surrounding\r\nnations. After the decline of Tyre, it was occupied by Greeks, then\r\npassed in turn to Assyrians, Egyptians, Persians, Romans, Saracens,\r\nByzantines, and in 1191 was seized by the Crusaders. Later it fell to\r\nEgypt again; but in 1373 was taken by Genoa, in 1463 by Venice, in 1571\r\nby the Turks, and finally in 1878 was consigned to England.[869] All\r\nthese successive occupants have left their mark upon its people, speech,\r\nculture and architecture. In the same way Sicily, located at the waist\r\nof the Mediterranean, has received the imprint of Greeks, Carthagenians,\r\nRomans, Saracens, Normans, Spaniards and Italians.[870] Its architectural\r\nremains bear the stamp of these successive occupants in every degree of\r\npurity and blending. The Sicilians of to-day are a mixture of all these\r\nintrusive stocks and speak a form of Italian corrupted by the infusion\r\nof Arabic words.[871] In 1071 when the Normans laid siege to Palermo,\r\nfive languages were spoken on the island,--Greek, Latin, Hebrew, Arabic\r\nand vulgar Sicilian, evidence enough that it was the meeting ground of\r\nthe nations of Europe, Asia and North Africa.[872] Polyglot Malta to-day\r\ntells the same story of successive conquests, the same shuttlecock\r\nhistory.[873] Almost every language of Europe is spoken here; but the\r\nnative Maltese speech is a corrupt form of Arabic mixed with modern\r\nItalian and ancient Phoenician words.[874] The whole island is\r\nethnographically a border hybrid of Europe and North Africa. The Channel\r\nIsles are to-day the only spot in Europe where French and English survive\r\nside by side as official and commercial languages. French and Italian\r\nmeet on equal terms in Corsica. Chinese, Japanese and Malays have\r\ntraded and warred and treated on the debatable land of Formosa. The Aru,\r\nKe, and other small archipelagoes of the Banda Sea link together the\r\npure Malay and the pure Papuan districts, between which they lie.\r\n\r\nFrom the border character of many islands there follow often\r\nfar-reaching historical effects. Like all border regions they are\r\nnatural battlegrounds. Their historical episodes are small, often slow\r\nand insidious in their movement, but large in their final content; for\r\nthey are prone to end in a sudden dramatic _denouement_ that draws the\r\nstartled gaze of all the neighboring world. It was the destiny of Sicily\r\nto make and unmake the fortunes of ancient Carthage. Ceylon, from the\r\ndawn of history, lured traders who enriched and conquerors who oppressed\r\npeninsular India. The advance of Spain to the Canary Isles was the\r\ndrowsy prologue to the brilliant drama of American discovery. The island\r\nof Tsushima in the Korean Strait was seized by the forces of Kublai Khan\r\nin 1280 as the base of their attack upon Japan;[875] and when in 1857 the\r\nRussian bear tried to plant a foot on this island, Japan saw danger in\r\nthe movement and ordered him off.[876] Now we find Japan newly\r\nestablished in Sakhalin, the Elliot Islands and Formosa, by means of\r\nwhich and her own archipelago she blankets the coast of Asia for\r\ntwenty-two hundred miles. This geographical situation may be productive\r\nof history.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Political detachability of islands.]\r\n\r\nIslands are detached areas physically and readily detached politically.\r\nThough insularity gives them some measure of protection, their\r\nrelatively small size and consequently small populations make them easy\r\nvictims for a conquering sea power, and easy to hold in subjection. The\r\nsecurity of an island habitat against aggression therefore, increases\r\nwith its size, its efficiency in naval warfare, and its degree of\r\nisolation, the last of which factors depends in turn upon its location\r\nas thalassic or oceanic. Islands of enclosed seas, necessarily small and\r\nnever far from the close encircling lands, are engulfed by every tide of\r\nconquest emanating from the nearby shores. Oesel and Dago have been held\r\nin succession by every Baltic power, by the Teutonic Orders, Denmark,\r\nSweden and Russia. Gotland has acknowledged allegiance to the Hanseatic\r\nLeague, to Denmark and Sweden. Sardinia, occupying the center of the\r\nwestern Mediterranean, has figured in a varied series of political\r\ncombinations,--with ancient Carthage, Rome, the Saracens of North\r\nAfrica, with Sicily, Pisa, Aragon, Piedmont, and finally now with united\r\nItaly.[877] To the land-bred Teutonic hordes which swept over western\r\nEurope in the early centuries of our era, a narrow strip of sea was some\r\nprotection for Sicily, Corsica, Sardinia, Malta and the Balearic Isles.\r\nHence we find these islands slow in succumbing to their non-maritime\r\nconquerors, and readily regained by the energetic Justinian. Later they\r\nfell victim to the sea-wise Saracens, but again gravitated back to their\r\ncloser and more natural European connections.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Insular weakness due to small area.]\r\n\r\nMore often the small area of an island facilitates its retention in\r\nbondage, when the large and less isolated continental districts have\r\nthrown off an unwelcome yoke. Athens, with her strong navy, found it an\r\neasy task to whip back into the ranks of the Delian Confederacy her\r\nrecalcitrant island subjects like Naxos, Samos and Thasos; but her\r\nmutinous cities in peninsular Chalcidice and isthmian Megara, incited to\r\nrevolt and aided by their neighbors,[878] were less at her mercy. This\r\nprinciple was recognized by Thucydides,[879] and taken advantage of by\r\nthe Lacedæmonians during the great war for Spartan supremacy. England\r\nhas been able to hold Ireland in a vise. Of all her former French\r\nterritory, she retains only the Channel Isles. Cuba and Porto Rico\r\nremained in the crushing grasp of Spain sixty-four years after Mexico\r\nand the continental states of Central and South America, by mutual help\r\nand encouragement, had secured independence. The islands found that the\r\nisolation which confers protection from outside aggression meant for\r\nthem detachment from friendly sources of succor on the mainland. The\r\ndesultory help of filibuster expeditions, easily checked at the port of\r\ndeparture or landing, availed little to supplement the inadequate forces\r\nof rebellion pent up on their relatively small areas. By contrast,\r\nMexico's larger area and population, continually stirred by American\r\nexample and encouragement, reinforced by American volunteers and even by\r\nUnited States army officers, found revolt from 1812 to 1824 a\r\ncomparatively easy task.\r\n\r\nCuba suffered from its geographic aloofness. So did little Crete, which\r\nsubmitted to Turkish oppression sixty years after the continental Greeks\r\nhad made good their claim to freedom. Nor was this the first time that\r\nCretan liberty had suffered from the detachment of an island\r\nenvironment. Aristotle recognized the principle when he wrote: \"The\r\npeople of Crete have hitherto submitted to the rule of the leading\r\nfamilies as _Cosmi_, because the insular situation of Crete cuts off the\r\ninterference of strangers or foreigners which might stir up rebellion\r\nagainst the unjust or partial government.\" And then he adds that this\r\ninsular exclusion of outside incitement long rendered the fidelity of\r\nthe _Perioeci_ or serf-like peasants of Crete a striking contrast to the\r\nuneasy spirit of the Spartan Helots, who were constantly stirred to\r\nrevolt by the free farmers of Argos, Messinia and Arcadia.[880] Thus\r\nancient like modern Crete missed those beneficient stimuli which\r\npenetrate a land frontier, but are cut off by the absolute boundary of\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Island remains of broken empires.]\r\n\r\nIsland fragments of broken empires are found everywhere. They figure\r\nconspicuously in that scattered location indicative of declining power.\r\nLittle St. Pierre and Miquelon are the last geographical evidences of\r\nFrance's former dominion in Canada. The English Bermudas and Bahamas\r\npoint back to the time when Great Britain held the long-drawn opposite\r\ncoast. The British, French, Dutch, Danish, as once even Swedish,\r\nholdings in the Lesser Antilles are island monuments to lost continental\r\ndomains, as recently were Cuba and Porto Rico to Spain's once vast\r\nAmerican empire. Of Portugal's widespread dominion in the Orient there\r\nremain to her only the island fragments of Timor, Kambing, Macao and\r\nDiu, besides two coastal points on the western face of peninsular India.\r\nAll the former continental holdings of the Sultan of Zanzibar have been\r\nabsorbed into the neighboring German and British territories, and only\r\nthe islands of Zanzibar and Pemba remain to him by the temporary\r\nindulgence of his strong neighbors. The Sheik of the Bahrein Islands\r\noriginally held also the large kingdom of El Hasa on the nearby Persian\r\nGulf littoral of Arabia; but he lost this to the Turks in 1840, and now\r\nretains the Bahrein Islands as the residuum of his former\r\nterritories.[881]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Security of such remnants merely passive.]\r\n\r\nThe insular remnants of empires are tolerated, because their small size,\r\nwhen unsupported by important location, usually renders them innocuous;\r\nand their geographic isolation removes them from international\r\nentanglements, unless some far-reaching anthropo-geographic readjustment\r\nlends them a new strategic or commercial importance. The construction of\r\nthe Suez Canal gave England a motive for the acquisition of Cyprus in\r\n1878, as a nearer base than Malta for the protection of Port Said, just\r\nas the present Panama Canal project led the United States to re-open\r\nnegotiations for the purchase of the Danish Isles. One cannot get away\r\nfrom the impression that the law of political detachability will operate\r\nagain to make some new distribution of the parti-colored political\r\nholdings in the Lesser Antilles. The small size of these islands, and\r\ntheir thalassic location commanding approaches to a large region of only\r\npartially developed resources and to the interoceanic passway across it,\r\nwill pitch them into the dice-box on the occasion of every naval war\r\nbetween their sovereign powers.\r\n\r\nThe shifting fate of political detachability becomes moderated in\r\nislands of the open ocean, because of their remoteness from the\r\ncolonizing or conquering movements emanating from the continents. In\r\ncontrast to the changing political connections of thalassic isles,\r\nconsider the calm or monotonous political history of outlying islands\r\nlike the Shetland, Faroes, Iceland, Canaries, Madeira, Cape Verde,\r\nAzores, St. Helena, Ascension and Hawaii. The Norse colony of Iceland,\r\nas a republic, maintained loose connections with its mother country from\r\n874 to 1264; then for nearly six centuries it followed the political\r\nfate of Norway till 1814, when an oversight left it in the hands of\r\nDenmark on the dissolution of the union of Denmark and Norway. The\r\nAzores have known no history except that which came to them from\r\nPortugal; even their discovery goes back to a Saracen navigator who, in\r\n1147, sailed from the mouth of the Tagus a thousand miles straight into\r\nthe sunset.[882] For two hundred years thereafter extreme isolation kept\r\nthem outside the pale of history till their rediscovery by Prince\r\nHenry, the Navigator.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Political autonomy of islands based upon area and location.]\r\n\r\nLand-masses, as we have found, are independent by location or\r\nindependent by size. Large islands, especially where they occupy an\r\noutskirt location, may long succeed in maintaining an independent\r\nnational existence; but to render this permanent, they must supplement\r\ntheir area by the acquisition of continental lands, according to the law\r\nof increasing territorial aggregates. Great Britain and Japan, though\r\nethnically and culturally appendages of the nearby mainland, were large\r\nenough, aided by the dividing sea, to maintain political autonomy. They\r\nabsorbed all the insular fragments lying about them to extend their\r\nareas, and then each in turn entered upon a career of continental\r\nexpansion. To Japan this movement as a determined policy came late, only\r\nwhen she faced the alternative of absorbing territory or being absorbed\r\nby all-devouring Russia. The isolation of Madagascar resulted in only\r\nslight community of race with Africa, and combined with large area, has\r\nkept the island to a great extent distinct from the political history of\r\nAfrica. The impulses which swept the eastern coast of the continent\r\nreached the outlying island with abated force. Arab, Portuguese, Dutch\r\nand English only scratched its rim. The character of its western coasts,\r\nof its vigorous Malayan population, and of the intervening Mozambique\r\nCurrent rendered conquest difficult from the African shore. Its large\r\nsize, with the promise of abundant resources, offered a bait to\r\nconquest, yet put a barrier in its way. Hence we find that not till\r\n1895, when the partition of continental Africa was almost accomplished,\r\ndid the French conquest of Madagascar occur.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, the closely grouped East Indies, long coveted for their\r\ntropical products, suffered a contagion of conquest. The large size of\r\nthese islands, so far from granting them immunity, only enabled the\r\nepidemic of Portuguese and Dutch dominion to pass from one to the other\r\nmore readily, and that even when the spice and pepper trade languished\r\nfrom a plethora of products. But even here the size of the islands,\r\nplus the sub-equatorial climate which bars genuine white colonization,\r\nhas restricted the effective political dominion of Europeans to the\r\ncoasts, and thus favored the survival of the natives undisturbed in the\r\ninterior, with all their primitive institutions. The largest islands,\r\nlike Borneo and Sumatra, have vast inland tracts still unexplored and\r\ndevoted to savagery, thus illustrating the contrast between center and\r\nperiphery. When Australia, the largest of all the Pacific island group,\r\nbecame an object of European expansion, its temperate and sub-tropical\r\nlocation adapted it for white colonization, and the easy task of\r\nconquering its weak and retarded native tribes encouraged its\r\nappropriation; but the natural autonomy which belongs to large area and\r\ndetached location asserted itself in the history of British Australia.\r\nThe island continent is now erected into a confederation of states,\r\nenjoying virtual independence. In New Zealand, we find the recent\r\ncolonists taking advantage of their isolation to work out undisturbed\r\ncertain unique social theories. Here, against a background of arrested\r\naboriginal development, another race evinces a radical spirit of\r\nprogress; and to these contrasted results equally the detached island\r\nenvironment has contributed its share.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Historical effects of island isolation; primitive\r\nretardation.]\r\n\r\nThe historical development of island peoples bears always in greater or\r\nless degree the stamp of isolation; but this isolation may lead to\r\nopposite cultural results. It may mean in one case retardation, in\r\nanother accelerated development. Its geographical advantages are\r\ndistinctly relative, increasing rapidly with a rising scale of\r\ncivilization. Therefore in an island habitat the race factor may operate\r\nwith or against the geographic factor in producing a desirable\r\nhistorical result. If the isolation is almost complete, the cultural\r\nstatus of the inhabitants low, and therefore their need of stimulation\r\nfrom without very great, the lack of it will sink them deeper in\r\nbarbarism than their kinsmen on the mainland. The negroes of Africa,\r\ntaken as a whole, occupy a higher economic and cultural rank than the\r\nblack races of Australia and Melanesia; and for this difference one\r\ncause at least is to be found in the difference of their habitats. The\r\nknowledge of iron, stock-raising, and many branches of agriculture were\r\ncontinental achievements, which belonged to the great eastern land-mass\r\nand spread from Egypt over Africa even to the Hottentot country; the\r\nlack of them among the Australians must be attributed to their\r\ninsularity, which barred them from this knowledge, just as the ignorance\r\nof iron and other metals among the native Canary Islanders[883] can only\r\nbe ascribed to a sea barrier fifty-two miles wide. The scant\r\nacquaintance of the Balearic Islanders with iron in Roman days[884]\r\npoints to insular detachment. The lack of native domesticable animals in\r\nthe Pacific archipelagoes illustrates another limitation incident to the\r\nrestricted fauna of islands, though this particular lack also retarded\r\nthe cultural development of primitive North America.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Later stimulation of development.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, people who have already secured the fundamental\r\nelements of civilization find the partial seclusion of an island\r\nenvironment favorable to their further progress, because it permits\r\ntheir powers to unfold unhindered, protects them from the friction of\r\nborder quarrels, from the disturbance and desolation of invading armies,\r\nto which continental peoples are constantly exposed. But even here the\r\nadvantage lies in insulation but not in isolation,[885] in a location\r\nlike that of England or Japan, near enough to a continent to draw thence\r\nculture, commerce and occasional new strains of blood, but detached by\r\nsea-girt boundaries broad enough to ward off overwhelming aggressions.\r\nSuch a location insures enough segregation for protection, but also\r\nopportunity for universal contact over the vast commons of the sea.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Excessive isolation.]\r\n\r\nExcessive isolation may mean impoverishment in purse and progress even\r\nfor an advanced race. Ireland has long suffered from its outskirt\r\nlocation. It lies too much in the shadow of England, and has been barred\r\nby the larger island from many warming rays of immigration, culture and\r\ncommerce that would have vitalized its national existence. The \"round\r\nbarrow\" men of the Bronze Age, the Romans, and the Normans never carried\r\nthither their respective contributions to civilization. The\r\nScandinavians infused into its population only inconsiderable strains of\r\ntheir vigorous northern blood.[886] In consequence the Irish are to-day\r\nsubstantially the same race as in Cæsar's time, except for the small,\r\nunassimilated group of antagonistic English and Lowland Scotch, both\r\nTeutonic, in Ulster.[887] Barred by Great Britain from direct contact\r\nwith the Continent and all its stimulating influences, suffering from\r\nunfavorable conditions of climate and topography, Ireland's political\r\nevolution progressed at a snail's pace. It tarried in the tribal stage\r\ntill after the English conquest, presenting a primitive social\r\norganization such as existed nowhere in continental Europe. Property was\r\ncommunal till the time of the Tudors, and all law was customary.[888]\r\nOver-protected by excessive isolation, it failed to learn the salutary\r\nlesson of political co-operation and centralization for defense, such as\r\nScotland learned from England's aggressions, and England from her close\r\ncontinental neighbors. Great Britain, meanwhile, intercepted the best\r\nthat the Continent had to give, both blows and blessings, and found an\r\nadvantage in each. The steady prosecution of her continental wars\r\ndemanded the gradual erection of a standing army, which weakened the\r\npower of feudalism; and the voting of funds for the conduct of these\r\nsame wars put a whip into the hand of Parliament.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The case of Iceland.]\r\n\r\nThe history of Iceland illustrates the advantage and subsequently the\r\ndrawback of isolation. The energetic spirits who, at the end of the\r\nninth century, resented the centralization of political power in Norway\r\nand escaped from the turmoil and oppression of the home country to the\r\nremote asylum offered by Iceland, maintained there till 1262 the only\r\nabsolutely free republic in the world.[889] They had brought with them\r\nvarious seeds of culture and progress, which grew and flowered richly in\r\nthis peaceful soil. Iceland became the center of brilliant maritime and\r\ncolonial achievements, the home of a native literature which surpassed\r\nthat of all its contemporaries except Dante's Italy.[890] But after the\r\ndecay of the Greenland colonies converted Iceland from a focal into a\r\nremote terminal point, and after the progress of the world became based\r\nupon complex and far-reaching commercial relations, the blight of\r\nextreme isolation settled upon the island; peace became stagnation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Protection of an island environment.]\r\n\r\nThe concomitant of isolation is protection. Though this protection, if\r\nthe result of extreme isolation, may mean an early cessation of\r\ndevelopment, history shows that in the lower stages of civilization,\r\nwhen the social organism is small and weak, and its germs of progress\r\neasily blighted, islands offer the sheltered environment in which\r\nimported flowers of culture not only survive but improve; in less\r\nprotected fields they deteriorate or disappear. When learning and\r\nChristianity had been almost wiped out on the continent of Europe by the\r\nravages of barbarian invasion between 450 and 800 A. D., in Ireland they\r\ngrew and flourished. In the seventh and eighth centuries, the high\r\nscholarship of the Irish monks and their enthusiastic love of learning\r\nfor its own sake drew to their schools students of the noblest rank from\r\nboth England and France.[891] It was from Irish teachers that the Picts\r\nof Scotland and the Angles of northern England received their first\r\nlessons in Christianity. These fixed their mission stations again on\r\nislands, on Iona off southwestern Scotland and on Lindisfarne or Holy\r\nIsle near the east coast of Northumbria.[892] It was in the protected\r\nenvironment of the medieval Iceland that Scandinavian literature reached\r\nits highest development.\r\n\r\nInsular protection was undoubtedly a factor in the brilliant cultural\r\ndevelopment of Crete. The progress of the early civilization from the\r\nlate Stone Age through the Bronze Age was continuous; it bears no trace\r\nof any strong outside influence or sudden transition, no evidence of\r\ndisturbance like an invasion or conquest by an alien people till 1200 B.\r\nC. when the latest stage of Minoan art was crushed by barbarian\r\nincursion from the north.[893]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Factor of protection in Ceylon and Japan.]\r\n\r\nThe early history of the Singhalese monarchy in Ceylon from 250 B. C. to\r\n416 A. D., when even the narrow moat of Palk Strait discouraged Tamil\r\ninvasions from the mainland, shows the brilliant development possible\r\nunder even a slight degree of protection.[894] However, in the case of\r\nthese Ceylon Aryans, as in that of the Icelandic Norse, we must keep in\r\nmind the fact that the bearers of this culture were picked men, as are\r\nearly maritime colonists the world over. The sea selects and then\r\nprotects its island folk. But the seclusion of Ceylon was more favorable\r\nto progress than the mainland of India, with its incessant political and\r\nreligious upheavals. Japan, in contrast to China's long list of\r\ninvasions, shows the peace of an insular location. She never suffered\r\nany overwhelming influx of alien races or any foreign conquest. The\r\narmada sent by Kublai Khan in 1281 to subdue the islands paralleled the\r\nexperience of the famous Spanish fleet three centuries later in English\r\nwaters. This is the only attempt to invade Japan that recorded history\r\nshows.[895] In the original peopling of the island by Mongolian stock at\r\nthe cost of the Aino aborigines, there is evidence of two distinct and\r\nperhaps widely separated immigrations from the mainland, one from Korea\r\nand another from more northern Asia. Thus Japan's population contained\r\ntwo continental elements, which seem to have held themselves in the\r\nrelation of governing and governed class, much as Norman and Saxon did\r\nin England, while the Ainos lingered in the geographical background of\r\nmountain fastness and outlying islands, as the primitive Celts did in\r\nthe British Isles.[896] In the case both of England and Japan, the island\r\nlocation made the occupation by continental races a fitful, piecemeal\r\nprocess, not an inundation, because only small parties could land from\r\ntime to time. The result was gradual or partial amalgamation of the\r\nvarious stocks, but nowhere annihilation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Character of the invaders as factor.]\r\n\r\nBut island location was not the sole factor in the equation. Similarity\r\nof race and relative parity of civilization between the successive\r\nimmigrants and the original population, as well as the small numbers of\r\nthe Invaders, made the struggle for the ownership of the island not\r\nwholly one-sided, and was later favorable to amalgamation in England as\r\nin Japan; whereas very small bands of far-coming Spaniards in the\r\nCanaries, Cuba, and Porto Rico resulted in the extinction of the\r\noriginal inhabitants, by the process operating now in New Zealand and\r\nAustralia. Prior to the arrival of the Europeans in the Antilles, the\r\nconquest of these islands by South American Caribs had resulted in race\r\nintermixture. These sea-marauders brought no women with them in their\r\nsmall boats from the distant mainland, so they killed off the men and\r\nmarried the Arawak women of the islands. Here again insular location\r\nplus similarity of race and culture produced amalgamation, as opposed\r\nto extermination of the vanquished by over-sea invaders.\r\n\r\nWhile the insular security of a primitive folk like the Tasmanians,\r\nHawaiians and Malagasies is only passive, that of a civilized people\r\nlike the English and modern Japanese is active, consciously utilized and\r\nreinforced. It is therefore more effective, and productive of more\r\nvaried political and cultural results. Such people can allow themselves\r\nextensive contact with other nations, because they know it is in their\r\npower to control or check such contact at will. Japan took refuge in its\r\nmedieval period in a policy of seclusion suggested by its island\r\nhabitat,[897] relying on the passive protection of isolation. England, on\r\nthe other hand, from the time of King Alfred, built up a navy to resist\r\ninvasion. The effect, after the political unification of Great Britain,\r\nwas a guarantee of protection against foreign attack, the concentration\r\nof the national defenses in a navy,[898] the elimination of the standing\r\narmy which despotic monarchs might have used to crush the people, the\r\nconsequent release of a large working force from military service, and\r\nthe application of these to the development of English Industry.[899]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Islands as places of refuge.]\r\n\r\nIslands, as naturally protected districts, are often sought places of\r\nrefuge by the weak or vanquished, and thus are drawn into the field of\r\nhistorical movement. We find this principle operating also in the animal\r\nworld. The fur seals of the North Pacific have fled from the American\r\ncoasts and found an asylum on the Pribiloff Islands of Bering Sea, where\r\ntheir concentration and isolation have enabled them to become wards of\r\nthe United States government, though this result they did not foresee.\r\nThe last Rhytina or Arctic sea-cow was found on an island in Bering\r\nStrait.[900] So the Veneti of Northern Italy in the fifth century sought\r\nan asylum from the desolating Huns and, a century later, from the\r\nLombards, in the deposit islands at the head of the Adriatic, and there\r\nfound the geographic conditions for a brilliant commercial and cultural\r\ndevelopment. Formosa got its first contingent of Chinese settlers in the\r\nthirteenth century in refugees seeking a place of safety from Kublai\r\nKhan's armies; and its second in 1644 in a Chinese chief and his\r\nfollowers who had refused to submit to the victorious Manchus. In 1637\r\nFormosa was an asylum also for Japanese Christians, who escaped thither\r\nfrom the persecutions attending the discovery of Jesuit conspiracies\r\nagainst the government.[901] The Azores, soon after their rediscovery in\r\n1431, were colonized largely by Flemish refugees,[902] just as Iceland\r\nwas peopled by rebellious Norwegians. To such voluntary exiles the\r\ndividing sea gives a peculiar sense of security, this by a psychological\r\nlaw. Hence England owing to its insular location, and also to its free\r\ngovernment, has always been an asylum for the oppressed. The large body\r\nof Huguenot refugees who sought her shores after the revocation of the\r\nEdict of Nantes added a valuable element to her population.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Convict islands.]\r\n\r\nIslands find their populations enriched by the immigration of this\r\nselect class who refuse to acquiesce in oppression and injustice. But\r\nthe geographic conditions which make islands natural asylums make them\r\nalso obvious places of detention for undesirable members of society;\r\nthese conditions render segregation complete, escape difficult or\r\nimpossible, and control easy. Hence we find that almost all the nations\r\nof the world owning islands have utilized them as penal stations. From\r\nthe gray dawn of history the Isles of the Blessed have been balanced by\r\nthe isles of the cursed. The radiant Garden of Hesperides has found its\r\nantithesis in the black hell of Norfolk Isle, peopled by the \"doubly\r\ncondemned\" criminals whom not even the depraved convict citizens of\r\nBotany Bay could tolerate.[903] There is scarcely an island of the\r\nMediterranean without this sinister vein in its history. The\r\narchipelagoes of the ancient Aegean were constantly receiving political\r\nexiles from continental Greece. Augustus Cæsar confined his degenerate\r\ndaughter Julia, the wife of Tiberius, on the island of Pandateria, one\r\nof the Ponza group; and banished her paramour, Sempronius Gracchus, to\r\nCercina in the Syrtis Minor off the African coast.[904] Other Roman\r\nmatrons of high degree but low morals and corrupt officials were exiled\r\nto Corsica, Sardinia, Seriphos, Amorgos and other of the Cyclades.[905]\r\nTo-day Italy has prisons or penal stations in Ischia, the Ponza group,\r\nProcida, Nisida, Elba, Pantellaria, Lampedusa, Ustica, and especially\r\nin the Lipari Isles, where the convicts are employed in mining sulphur,\r\nalum and pumice from the volcanic cones.[906]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Penal colonies on uninhabited islands.]\r\n\r\nIn modern times many remote oceanic islands have gotten their first or\r\nonly white settlers from this criminal class. Such are the citizens whom\r\nChile has sent to Easter Isle twenty-five hundred miles away out in the\r\nPacific.[907] The inhabitants of Fernando Noronha, 125 miles off the\r\neastern point of South America, are convicts from Brazil, together with\r\nthe warders and troops who guard them.[908] In 1832 Ecuador began to use\r\nthe uninhabited Gallapagos Islands, lying 730 miles west of its coast,\r\nas a penal settlement.[909] The history of St. Helena is typical. Its\r\nfirst inhabitants were some Portuguese deserters who in punishment were\r\nmarooned here from a Portuguese ship with a supply of seed and cattle.\r\nThey proved industrious and had cultivated a good deal of the land when\r\nfour years later they were removed to Portugal. The next inhabitants\r\nwere a few slaves of both sexes who escaped from a slave ship that had\r\nstopped here for wood and water. These multiplied, worked and restored\r\nthe overgrown plantations of their predecessors, till a Portuguese\r\nvessel about twenty years later was sent to exterminate them. A few\r\nescaped to the woods, however, and were found there in prosperity in\r\n1588.[910] From 1815 till 1821 St. Helena was the prison of Napoleon.\r\n\r\nMany of these penal islands seem chosen with a view to their severe or\r\nunhealthy climate, which would forever repel free immigration and\r\ntherefore render them useless for any other purpose. This is true of the\r\nFrench Isles du Salut off the Guiana coast, of Spanish Fernando Po in\r\nthe Gulf of Guinea, of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, notoriously\r\nunhealthy, which receive the criminals of British India,[911] and of\r\nnumerous others. A bleak climate and unproductive soil have added to the\r\nhorror of exile life in Sakhalin, as they overshadowed existence in the\r\nFalkland Islands, when these were a penal colony of Spain and later of\r\nArgentine.[912]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Island prisons for political offenders.]\r\n\r\nIn the case of political offenders and incorrigibles, the island prison\r\nis as remote and inaccessible as possible. The classic example is\r\nNapoleon's consignment to Elba and subsequently to St. Helena, whence\r\nescape was impossible. Spain has sent its rebellious subjects, even\r\nuniversity professors of independent views, to Fernando Po in the Gulf\r\nof Guinea and Teneriffe in the Canaries.[913] Russian political\r\noffenders of the most dangerous class are confined first in the\r\nSchlüsselberg prison, situated on a small island in Lake Ladoga near the\r\neffluence of the Neva. There they languish in solitary confinement or\r\nare transferred to far-off Sakhalin, whose very name is taboo in St.\r\nPetersburg.[914] During our Civil War, one of the Dry Tortugas, lying a\r\nhundred miles west of the southern point of Florida and at that time the\r\nmost isolated island belonging to the American government, was used as a\r\nprison for dangerous Confederates; and here later three conspirators in\r\nthe assassination of President Lincoln were incarcerated.[915] Far away\r\nto the southeast, off the coast of South America, are the Isles du\r\nSalut, a French penal station for criminals of the worst class. The Isle\r\ndu Diable, ominous of name, lies farthest out to sea. This was for five\r\nyears the prison of Dreyfus. Its other inhabitants are lepers. Isles of\r\nthe cursed indeed!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Islands as places of survival.]\r\n\r\nWhat islands have they tend to hold, to segregate, secrete from meddling\r\nhands, preserve untouched and unaltered. Owing to this power to protect,\r\nislands show a large percentage of rare archaic forms of animal and\r\nplant life. The insular fauna of Australia, Tasmania, New Guinea and\r\nMadagascar display a succession of strange, ancestral forms going back\r\nto the biological infancy of the world. The Canaries in the Atlantic and\r\nCelebes In the Pacific are museums of living antiquities, some of them\r\ndating probably from Miocene times.[916] Such survivals are found\r\nelsewhere only in high mountains, whose inaccessible slopes also offer\r\nprotection against excessive competition. Hence some of the antiquated\r\nspecies of insular Celebes, Formosa, Japan and Hainon occur again on the\r\nAsiatic mainland only in the Himalayas.[917]\r\n\r\nFor man, too, islands and their sister areas of isolation, mountains,\r\nare areas of survivals. The shrinking remnants of that half-dwarf\r\nNegrito stock which may have formed the aboriginal population of\r\nsouthern Asia are found to-day only in the mountains of peninsular\r\nIndia and in island groups like the Andaman and the Philippines. But\r\neven in the Philippines, they are confined either to the mountainous\r\ninteriors of the larger islands, or to little coastal islets like\r\nPolillo, Alabat, Jomalig, and others.[918] [See map page 147.] Yezo,\r\nSakhalin and the Kurile Isles harbor the last feeble remnants of the\r\nAinos, a primitive people who formerly occupied a long stretch of the\r\nAsiatic coast south of the Amur mouth. The protected environment of\r\nthese islands has postponed the doom of extinction toward which the\r\nAinos are hastening.[919] With insular conservatism they dress, live and\r\nseek their food on the sea to-day, just as depicted in Japanese art and\r\nliterature at the dawn of history.[920] [See map page 103.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Insular survivals of manners and customs.]\r\n\r\nIt is chiefly on islands of harsh climatic conditions, like Sakhalin, or\r\nof peculiarly restricted resources and area, like the Andaman, or of\r\nremote, side-tracked location, like Iceland, Sardinia and Cape Breton,\r\nthat the stamp of the primitive or antiquated is strongest. Even when\r\nnot apparent in race stock, owing to the ubiquitous colonization of\r\nmaritime peoples, it marks the language and customs of even these\r\nlate-coming occupants, because an island environment asserts always some\r\npower to isolate. This is due not only to the encircling moat of sea,\r\nbut also to the restricted insular area, too small to attract to itself\r\nthe great currents of human activity which infuse cosmopolitan ideas and\r\ninnovations, and too poor to buy the material improvements which\r\nprogress offers. If the tourist in Sicily finds the women of Taormina or\r\nGirgenti spinning with a hand spindle, and the express trains moving\r\nonly twelve miles an hour, he can take these two facts as the product of\r\na small, detached area, although this island lies at the crossroads of\r\nthe Mediterranean. Corsica and Sardinia, lying off the main routes of\r\ntravel in this basin, are two of the most primitive and isolated spots\r\nof Europe. Here the old wooden plow of Roman days is still in common use\r\nas it is in Crete, and feudal institutions of the Middle Ages still\r\nprevail to some extent[921],--a fact which recalls the long survival of\r\nfeudalism in Japan. The little Isle of Man, almost in sight of the\r\nEnglish coast, has retained an old Norse form of government. Here\r\nsurvives the primitive custom of orally proclaiming every new law from\r\nthe Tynwald Hill before it can take effect,[922] and the other ancient\r\nusage of holding the court of justice on the same hill under the open\r\nsky. The Faroe Islands and Iceland are museums of Norse antiquities. The\r\nstamp of isolation and therefore conservatism is most marked in the\r\nremoter, northern islands. Surnames are rare in Iceland, and such as\r\nexist are mostly of foreign origin. In their place, Christian names\r\nfollowed by the patronymic prevail; but in the Faroes, these patronymics\r\nhave in a great many cases become recognized as surnames. So again,\r\nwhile the Faroese women still use a rude spinning-wheel introduced from\r\nScotland in 1671, in Iceland this spinning-wheel was still an innovation\r\nin 1800, and even to-day competes with spindles. Hand-querns for\r\ngrinding wheat, stone hammers for pounding fish and roots, the wooden\r\nweighing-beam of the ancient Northmen, and quaint marriage customs give\r\nthe final touch of aloofness and antiquity to life on these remote\r\nislands.[923]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effects of small area in islands.]\r\n\r\nAs all island life bears more or less the mark of isolation, so it\r\nbetrays the narrow area that has served at its base. Though islands show\r\na wide variation in size from the 301,000 square miles (771,900 square\r\nkilometers) of New Guinea or the 291,000 square miles (745,950 square\r\nkilometers) of Borneo to the private estates like the Scilly Isles,\r\nGardiner and Shelter islands off Long Island, or those small, sea-fenced\r\npastures for sheep and goats near the New England coast and in the\r\nAegean, yet small islands predominate; the large ones are very few.\r\nIslands comprise a scant seven per cent. of the total land area of the\r\nearth, and their number is very great,--nine hundred, for instance, in\r\nthe Philippine group alone. Therefore small area is a conspicuous\r\nfeature of islands generally. It produces in island people all those\r\neffects which are characteristic of small, naturally defined areas,\r\nespecially early or precocious social, political and cultural\r\ndevelopment. The value of islands in this respect belongs to the youth\r\nof the world, as seen in the ancient Mediterranean, or in the\r\nadolescence of modern primitive races; it declines as the limitations\r\nrather than the advantages of restricted territory preponderate in later\r\nhistorical development.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Political dominion of small islands.]\r\n\r\nThis early maturity, combined with the power to expend the concentrated\r\nnational or tribal forces in any given direction, often results in the\r\ndomination of a very small island over a large group. In the Society\r\nIslands, Cook found little Balabola ruling over Ulietea (Raitea) and\r\nOtaha, the former of these alone being over twice the size of Balabola,\r\nwhose name commanded respect as far as Tahiti.[924] The Fiji Archipelago\r\nwas ruled in pre-Christian days by the little islet of Mbau, scarcely a\r\nmile long, which lies like a pebble beside massive Viti Levu. It was the\r\nchief center of political power and its supremacy was owned by nearly\r\nall the group. The next important political center was Rewa, no larger\r\nthan Mbau, which had for its subject big Mbengga.[925] In the same way,\r\nthe Solomon group was ruled by Mongusaie and Simbo, just as tiny New\r\nLauenberg lorded it over the larger islands of the Bismarck\r\nArchipelago.[926] When the Dutch in 1613 undertook the conquest of the\r\ncoveted Spice Isles, they found there two rival sultans seated in the\r\ntwo minute islets of Ternate and Tidore off the west coast of Gilolo.\r\nTheir collective possessions, which the Dutch took, comprised all the\r\nMoluccas, the Ke and Banda groups, the whole of northwestern New Guinea,\r\nand Mindanao of the Philippines.[927]\r\n\r\nIt was no unusual thing for classic Aegean isles to control and exploit\r\ngoodly stretches of the nearest coast, or to exercise dominion over\r\nother islands. Aristotle tells us that Crete's location across the\r\nsouthern end of the Aegean Sea confirmed to it by nature the early naval\r\nempire of the Hellenic world. Minos conquered some of the islands,\r\ncolonized others,[928] and, according to the story of Theseus and the\r\nMinotaur, laid Athens under tribute; but his suppression of piracy in\r\nthese waters and his conspicuous leadership in the art of navigation\r\npoint to a yet more significant supremacy. So insular Venice ruled and\r\nexploited large dependencies. The island of Zealand, strategically\r\nlocated at the entrance to the Baltic, has been the heart and head and\r\nstrong right arm of the Danish dominion, through all its long history of\r\nfluctuating boundaries. England's insularity has been the strongest\r\nsingle factor in the growth of her vast colonial empire and in the\r\nmaintenance of its loyal allegiance and solidarity. The widely strewn\r\nplantation of her colonies is the result of that teeming island seed-bed\r\nat home; while the very smallness of the mother country is the guarantee\r\nof its supremacy over its dependencies, because it is too small either\r\nto oppress them or to get along without them. Now an Asiatic variant of\r\nEnglish history is promised us by growing Japan.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Economic limitations of their small area.]\r\n\r\nThough political supremacy is possible even to an island of\r\ninsignificant size, both the advantages arid the grave disadvantages of\r\nsmall area are constantly asserting themselves. Some developments\r\npeculiar to large territory are here eliminated at the start. For\r\ninstance, robbery and brigandage, which were so long a scourge in\r\npeninsular Greece, were unheard of on the small Aegean islands.\r\nSheep-raising was at an early date safer in England than on the\r\nContinent, because wolves were earlier exterminated there. Bio-geography\r\nshows an increasing impoverishment in the flora and fauna, of small\r\nislands with distance from the mainland. In the Pacific Ocean, this\r\nprogressive impoverishment from west to east has had great influence\r\nupon human life in the islands. In Polynesia, therefore, all influences\r\nof the chase and of pastoral life are wanting, while in Melanesia, with\r\nits larger islands and larger number of land animals, hunting still\r\nplays an important part, and is the chief source of subsistence for many\r\nNew Guinea villages.[929] Therefore a corresponding decay of projectile\r\nweapons is to be traced west to east, and is conspicuous in those crumbs\r\nof land constituting Polynesia and Micronesia. The limit of the bow and\r\narrow includes the northeastern portion of the Philippine group, cuts\r\nthrough the Malay Archipelago so as to include the Moluccas and Flores,\r\nincludes Melanesia as far as Tonga or the Friendly Isles, but excludes\r\nMicronesia, Polynesia and Australia, Even in Melanesia, however, bows\r\nand arrows are not universal; they are lacking in peripheral islands\r\nlike New Caledonia and New Ireland.[930]\r\n\r\nThe restriction of trees, also, with the exception of the coco-palm and\r\npandanus, has had its effect upon boat making. This general\r\nimpoverishment is unmistakably reflected in the whole civilization of\r\nthe smaller islands of Polynesia and Micronesia, especially in the\r\nPaumota and Pelew groups. In the countless coralline islands which strew\r\nthe Pacific, another restricting factor is found in their monotonous\r\ngeological formation. Owing to the lack of hard stone, especially of\r\nflint, native utensils and weapons have to be fashioned out of wood,\r\nbones, shells, and sharks' teeth.[931]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Poverty of alluvial lowlands in islands.]\r\n\r\nNor does the geographical limitation end here. Islands have\r\nproportionately a scanter allowance of fertile alluvial lowlands than\r\nhave continents. This follows from their geological history, except in\r\nthe case of those low deposit islands built up from the waste of the\r\nland. Most islands are summits of submerged mountain ranges, like\r\nCorsica and Sardinia, the Aegean archipelagoes, the Greater Antilles,\r\nVancouver, and the countless fiord groups; or they are single or\r\ncomposite volcanic cones, like the Canaries, Azores, Lipari, Kurile,\r\nFiji, Ascension, St. Helena and the Lesser Antilles; or they are a\r\ncombination of highland subsidence and volcanic out-thrust, like Japan,\r\nthe Philippines, the long Sunda chain and Iceland. Both geologic\r\nhistories involve high reliefs, steep slopes, a deep surrounding sea,\r\nand hence rarely a shallow continental shelf for the accumulation of\r\nbroad alluvial lowlands. Among the Aegean Isles only Naxos has a flood\r\nplain; all the rest have steep coasts, with few sand or gravel beaches,\r\nand only small deposit plains at the head of deep and precipitous\r\nembayments. Japan's area of arable soil is to-day only 15.7 per cent. of\r\nits total surface, even after the gentler slopes of its mountains have\r\nbeen terraced up two thousand feet. Some authorities put the figure\r\nlower, at 10 and 12 per cent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dense populations of islands.]\r\n\r\nYet in spite of limited area and this paucity of local resources,\r\nislands constantly surprise us by their relatively dense populations.\r\nMore often than not they show a density exceeding that of the nearest\r\nmainland having the same zonal location, often the same geologic\r\nstructure and soil. Along with other small, naturally defined areas,\r\nthey tend to a closer packing of the population. Yet side by side with\r\nthis relative over-population, we find other islands uninhabited or\r\ntenanted only by sheep, goats and cattle.\r\n\r\nIn the wide Pacific world comprising Australia and Oceanica, islands\r\ntake up fifteen per cent. of the total land area, but they contain\r\nforty-four per cent. of the population.[932] The insular empire of\r\nJapan, despite the paucity of its arable soil, has a density of\r\npopulation nearly twice that of China, nearly three times that of Korea,\r\nand exceeding that of any political subdivision of continental Asia; but\r\nJapan, in turn, is surpassed in congestion only by Java, with a density\r\nof 587 to the square mile,[933] which almost equals that of Belgium\r\n(643) and England (600). Great Britain has a density of population (453\r\nto the square mile) only exceeded in continental Europe by that of\r\nBelgium, but surpassed nearly threefold by that of the little Channel\r\nIsles, which amounts to 1254 to the square mile.[934] If the average\r\ndensity of the United Kingdom is greatly diminished in Ireland, just as\r\nItaly's is in Sardinia and France's in Corsica, this fact is due\r\nprimarily to a side-tracked or overshadowed location and adverse\r\ntopography, combined with misgovernment.\r\n\r\nIf we compare countries which are partly insular, partly continental,\r\nthe same truth emerges. The kingdom of Greece has fifteen per cent of\r\nits territory in islands. Here again population reaches its greatest\r\ncompactness in Corfu and Zante, which are nearly thrice as thickly\r\ninhabited as the rest of Greece.[935] Similarly the islands which\r\nconstitute so large a part of Denmark have an average density of 269 to\r\nthe square mile as opposed to the 112 of Jutland. The figures rise to\r\n215 to the square mile in the Danish West Indies, but drop low in the\r\nbleak, subarctic insular dependencies of Greenland, Iceland and the\r\nFaroes. Portugal's density is tripled in the Madeiras[936] and doubled\r\nin the Azores,[937] but drops in the badly placed Cape Verde Island,\r\nexposed to tropical heat and the desiccating tradewinds blowing off the\r\nSahara. Spain's average rises twenty-five per cent. in the Canary\r\nIslands, which she has colonized, and France's nearly doubles in the\r\nFrench West Indies. The British West Indies, also, with the exception of\r\nthe broken coral bank constituting the Bahamas, show a similar\r\nsurprising density of population, which in Bermuda and Barbadoes\r\nsurpasses that of England, and approximates the teeming human life of\r\nthe Channel Isles.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Density of population in Polynesia.]\r\n\r\nThis general tendency toward a close packing of the population in the\r\nsmaller areas of land comes out just as distinctly in islands inhabited\r\nby natural peoples in the lower stages of development. Despite the\r\nretarded economic methods peculiar to savagery and barbarism, the\r\nPolynesian islands, for instance, often show a density of population\r\nequal to that of Spain and Greece (100 to the square mile) and exceeding\r\nthat of European Turkey and Russia. \"Over the whole extent of the South\r\nSea,\" says Robert Louis Stevenson, \"from one tropic to another, we find\r\ntraces of a bygone state of over-population, when the resources of even\r\na tropical soil were taxed, and even the improvident Polynesian trembled\r\nfor the future.\"[938] He calls the Gilbert atolls \"warrens of men.\"[939]\r\nOne of them, Drummond's Island, with, an area of about twenty square\r\nmiles, contained a population of 10,000 in 1840, and all the atolls were\r\ndensely populated.[940] To-day they count 35,000 inhabitants in less\r\nthan 200 square miles. The neighboring Marshall group has 15,000 on its\r\n158 square miles of area. The Caroline and Pelew archipelagoes show a\r\ndensity of 69 to the square mile, the Tonga or Friendly group harbor\r\nabout 60 and the French holdings of Futuma and Wallis (or Uea) the\r\nsame.[941] So the Bismarck Archipelago, Solomon, Hawaiian, Samoan and\r\nMarianne islands have to-day populations by no means sparse, despite the\r\nblight that everywhere follows the contact of superior with primitive\r\npeoples.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Various causes of this density.]\r\n\r\nIn all these cases, if economic status be taken into account, we have a\r\ndensity bordering on congestion; but the situation assumes a new aspect\r\nif we realize that the crowded inhabitants of small islands often have\r\nthe run of the coco plantations and fishing grounds of an entire\r\narchipelago. The smaller, less desirable islands are retained as fish\r\nand coco-palm preserves to be visited only periodically. Of a low,\r\ncramped, monotonous coral group, often only the largest and most\r\nproductive is inhabited,[942] but that contains a population surprising\r\nin view of the small base, restricted resources and low cultural status\r\nof its inhabitants. The population of the wide-strewn Paumota atolls\r\nwas estimated as about 10,000 in 1840. Of these fully one-half lived on\r\nAnaa or Chain Island, and one-fourth on Gambier, but they levied on the\r\nresources of the other islands for supplies.[943] The Tonga Islands at\r\nthe same time were estimated to have 20,000 inhabitants, about half of\r\nwhom were concentrated on Tongatabu, while Hapai and Varao held about\r\n4,000 each.[944]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Crowded and vacant islands.]\r\n\r\nThis is one of the sharp contrasts in island life,--here density akin to\r\ncongestion, there a few miles away a deserted reef or cone rising from\r\nthe sea, tenanted only by sheep or goats or marine birds, its solitude\r\nbroken only by the occasional crunching of a boat's keel upon its beach,\r\nas some visitant from a neighboring isle comes to shear wool, gather\r\ncoco-nuts, catch birds or collect their eggs. All the 500 inhabitants of\r\nthe Westman Isles off the southern coast of Iceland live in one village\r\non Heimey, and support themselves almost entirely by fishing and fowling\r\nbirds on the wild crags of the archipelago.[945] An oceanic climate,\r\nfree contact with the Gulf Stream, and remoteness from the widespread\r\nice fields of Iceland give them an advantage over the vast island to the\r\nnorth. Only twenty-seven of the ninety islands composing the Orkney\r\ngroup are inhabited, and about forty smaller ones afford natural meadows\r\nfor sheep on their old red sandstone soil;[946] but Pomona, the largest\r\nOrkney has 17,000 inhabitants on its 207 square miles of territory or 85\r\nto the square mile. The Shetlands tell the same story--29 out of 100\r\nislands inhabited, some of the _holms_ or smaller islets serving as\r\npastures for the sturdy ponies and diminutive cattle, and Mainland, the\r\nlargest of the group, showing 58 inhabitants to the square mile. This is\r\na density far greater than is reached in the nearby regions of Scotland,\r\nwhere the county of Sutherland can boast only 13 to the square mile, and\r\nInvernesshire 20. Here again insularity and contracted area do their\r\nwork of compressing population.\r\n\r\nThe causes of this insular density of population are not far to seek.\r\nIslands can always rely on the double larder of land and sea. They are\r\nmoreover prone to focus in themselves the fishing industry of a large\r\ncontinental area, owing to their ample contact with the sea. Shetland is\r\nnow the chief seat of the Scotch herring fishery, a fact which\r\ncontributes to its comparatively dense population. The concentration of\r\nthe French export trade of Newfoundland fish in little St. Pierre and\r\nMiquelon accounts for the relatively teeming population (70 to the\r\nsquare mile) and the wealth of those scraps of islands. So the Lofoden\r\nIslands of Norway, like Iceland, Newfoundland and Sakhalin, balance a\r\ngenerous sea against an ungenerous soil, and thus support a population\r\notherwise impossible.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Oceanic climate as factor.]\r\n\r\nFor these far northern islands, the moderating effect of an oceanic\r\nclimate has been a factor in making them relatively populous, just as it\r\nis on tropical isles by mitigating heat and drought. The prosperity and\r\npopulousness of the Bermuda Islands are to be explained largely by the\r\nmild, equable climate which permits the raising of early vegetables and\r\nflowers for English and American markets. Like climatic conditions and a\r\nlike industry account for the 2,000 souls living on the inhabited\r\nislands of the Scilly group. Here intensive horticulture supports a\r\nlarge force of workmen and yields a profit to the lord proprietor. Syros\r\nin the Cyclades fattens on its early spring vegetable trade with Athens\r\nand Constantinople.[947]\r\n\r\nIn the Mediterranean lands, where drought and excessive heat during the\r\ngrowing season offer adverse conditions for agriculture, the small\r\nislands, especially those of fertile volcanic soil, show the greatest\r\nproductivity and hence marked density of population. Though the rainfall\r\nmay be slight, except where a volcanic peak rises to condense moisture,\r\nheavy dews and the thick mists of spring quicken vegetation. This is the\r\ncase in Malta, which boasts a population of 2,000 to the square mile,\r\nexclusive of the English garrison.[948] Little Limosa and Pantellaria,\r\nthe merest fragments of land out in the mid-channel of the\r\nMediterranean, have a population of 200 to the square mile.[949] The\r\nLipari group north of Sicily average nearly 400 on every square mile of\r\ntheir fertile soil;[950] but this average rises in Salina to 500, and in\r\nLipari itself, as also in Ponza of the Pontine group, to nearly 1300.\r\nHere fertile volcanic slopes of highly cultivated land lift vineyards,\r\norchards of figs, and plantations of currants to the sunny air. But\r\nnearby Alicuri, almost uncultivated, has a sparse population of some\r\nfive hundred shepherds and fishermen. Panaria and Filicuri are in about\r\nthe same plight. Here again we find those sharp island contrasts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Relation of density to area.]\r\n\r\nThe insular region of the Indian Ocean, which is inhabited by peoples\r\nquite different in race and cultural status from those of the\r\nMediterranean, yet again demonstrates the power of islands to attract,\r\npreserve, multiply and concentrate population. This is especially true\r\nof the smaller islands, which in every case show a density of population\r\nmany times that of the neighboring mainland of Africa. Only vast\r\nMadagascar, continental in size, repeats the sparsity of the continent.\r\nAn oceanic climate increases the humidity of the islands as compared\r\nwith the mainland lying in the same desiccating tradewind belt. Moreover\r\ntheir small area has enabled them to be permeated by incoming Arab,\r\nEnglish, and French influences, which have raised their status of\r\ncivilization and therewith the average density of population. This\r\nculminates in English Mauritius, which shows 540 inhabitants to the\r\nsquare mile, occupied in the production of sugar, molasses, rum,\r\nvanilla, aloes, and copra. In Zanzibar this density is 220 to the square\r\nmile; in Reunion 230; in Mayotte, the Comores and Seychelles, the\r\naverage varies from 100 to 145 to the square mile, though Mahe in the\r\nSeychelles group has one town of 20,000 inhabitants.[951]\r\n\r\nIn the Malay Archipelago, an oceanic climate and tropical location have\r\ncombined to stimulate fertility to the greatest extent; but this local\r\nwealth has been exploited in the highest degree in the smaller islands\r\nhaving relatively the longest coastline and amplest contact with the\r\nsea. The great continent-like areas of Borneo, New Guinea and Sumatra\r\nshow a correspondingly sparse population; Java, smaller than the\r\nsmallest of these and coated with mud from its fertilizing volcanoes,\r\nsupports 587 inhabitants to the square mile; but this exceptional\r\naverage is due to rare local productivity. Java's little neighbors to\r\nthe east, Bali and Lombok, each with an area of only about 2100 square\r\nmiles, have a density respectively of 338 and 195 to the square mile.\r\nThis density rises suddenly in small Amboina (area 264 square miles),\r\nthe isle of the famous clove monopoly, to 1000,[952] drops in the other\r\nMoluccas, where Papuan influences are strong, even to 20, but rises\r\nagain in the pure Malayan Philippines to 69. In the Philippines a\r\ndistinct connection is to be traced between the density of population\r\nand smallness of area. The explanation lies in the attraction of the\r\ncoast for the sea-faring Malay race, and the mathematical law of\r\nincrease of shoreline with decrease of insular area. Since 65 per cent.\r\nof the whole Philippine population inhabits coastal municipalities, it\r\nis not surprising that the 73 islands from ten to a hundred square miles\r\nin area count 127 inhabitants to the square mile, and those of less than\r\nten square miles, of which there are nearly a thousand, have a density\r\nof 238.[953]\r\n\r\nThis same insular density, supported by fertility, fisheries and trade,\r\nappears again in the West Indies, and also the contrast in density\r\nbetween large and small islands down to a certain limit of\r\ndiminutiveness. The Greater Antilles increase in density from Cuba\r\nthrough smaller Haiti and Jamaica down to little Porto Rico, which\r\nboasts 264 inhabitants to the square mile. In the smaller area of the\r\nDanish Indies and Guadeloupe about this same density (215 and 274)\r\nreappears; but it mounts to 470 in Martinique and to 1160 in\r\nBarbadoes.[954]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Island resorts.]\r\n\r\nClimate advantages often encourage density of population on islands, by\r\nattracting to them visitors who make a local demand for the fruits of\r\nthe soil and thereby swell the income of the islands. For instance,\r\nabout the densely populated region of the Gulf of Naples, Procida has\r\n14,000 inhabitants on its one and a half square miles of area, while\r\nfertile Ischia and Capri have 1400 to the square mile. Here a rich\r\nvolcanic soil, peaks which attract rain by their altitude and visitors\r\nby their beauty, and a mild oceanic climate delightful in winter as in\r\nsummer, all contribute to density of population. Sicily, Malta and Corfu\r\nalso gain in the same way in winter. The Isle of Man owes some of its\r\nrecent increase of population, now 238 to the square mile, to the fact\r\nthat it has become the summer playground for the numerous factory\r\nworkers of Lancashire in England.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Density of population affected by focal location for trade.]\r\n\r\nSometimes climatic advantages are reinforced by a favorable focal point,\r\nwhich brings the profits of trade to supplement those of agriculture.\r\nThis factor of distributing and exporting center has undoubtedly\r\ncontributed to the prosperity and population of Reunion, Mahe, Mauritius\r\nand Zanzibar, as it did formerly to that of ancient Rhodes and modern\r\nSt. Thomas at the angle of the Antilles. Barbadoes, by reason of its\r\noutpost location to the east of the Windward Isles, is the first to\r\ncatch incoming vessels from England, and is therefore a focus of\r\nsteamship lines and a distributing point for the southern archipelago,\r\nso that we find here the greatest density of any island in the West\r\nIndies.[955] The 9405 inhabitants of Charlotte Amalie on St. Thomas and\r\nthe 15,000 of Willemsted on Curaçao give these also a characteristic\r\ninsular density. Samos, blessed with good soil, an excellent position on\r\nAegean maritime routes, and virtual autonomy, supports a population of\r\n300 to the square mile.[956]\r\n\r\nFocal location alone can often achieve this density. Syros, one of the\r\nsmallest and by nature the most barren of the Cyclades, though well\r\ntilled is the great commercial and shipping center of the Aegean, and\r\nhas in Hermupolis with its 17,700 population by far the largest town of\r\nthe archipelago.[957] This development has come since Greece achieved\r\nits independence. It reminds us of the distinction and doubtless also\r\npopulation that belonged to Delos in ancient days. Advantageous\r\ncommercial location and density of population characterize Kilwauru and\r\nSingapore at the east and west extremities of the Malay Archipelago. The\r\nBahrein Islands, which England has acquired in the Persian Gulf, serve\r\nas an emporium of trade with eastern Arabia and have a local wealth in\r\ntheir pearl fisheries. These facts account for the 68,000 inhabitants\r\ndwelling on their 240 square miles (600 square kilometers) of sterile\r\nsurface.[958]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Overflow of island population to the mainland.]\r\n\r\nThe concentration of population in these favored spots of land with\r\ninelastic boundaries, and the tendency of that population to increase\r\nunder the stimulating, interactive life make the restriction of area\r\nsoon felt. For this reason, so many colonies which are started on\r\ninshore islets from motives of protection have to be transferred to the\r\nmainland to insure a food supply. A settlement of Huguenots, made in\r\n1535 on an island in the harbor of Rio Janeiro, found its base too small\r\nfor cultivation, but feared the attack of the hostile Indians and\r\nPortuguese on the mainland. After three years of a struggling existence,\r\nit fell a prey to the Portuguese,[959] De Monts' short-lived colony on\r\nan island in the mouth of the St. Croix River in 1604 had an excellent\r\nsite for defence, but was cut off by the drifting ice in winter from\r\nmainland supplies of wood, water and game, while no cultivation was\r\npossible in the sandy soil.[960]\r\n\r\nSuch sites suffice for mere trading posts, but are inadequate for the\r\nlarger social group of a real colony. The early Greek colonists, with\r\ntheir predilection for insular locations, recognized this limitation and\r\noffset it by the occupation of a strip of the nearest mainland,\r\ncultivated and defended by fortified posts, as an adjunct to the support\r\nof the islands. Such a subsidiary coastal hem was called a _Paraea_. The\r\nancient Greek colonies on the islands of Thasos and Samothrace each\r\npossessed such a Paraea.[961] The Aeolian inhabitants of Tenedos held a\r\nstrip of the opposite Troad coast north of Cape Lekton, while those of\r\nLesbos appropriated the south coast of the Troad.[962] In the same way\r\nTarentum and Syracuse, begun on inshore islands, soon overflowed on to\r\nthe mainland. Sometimes the island site is abandoned altogether and the\r\ncolony transferred to the mainland. The ancient Greek colony of Cyrene\r\nhad an initial existence on the island of Platea just off the Libyan\r\ncoast, but, not flourishing there, was moved after an interval of\r\nseveral years to the African mainland, where \"the sky was perforated\" by\r\nthe mountains of Barca.[963] De Monts' colony was removed from its\r\nisland to Port Royal in Nova Scotia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Precocious development of island agriculture.]\r\n\r\nWhere an island offers in its climate and soil conditions favorable to\r\nagriculture, tillage begins early to assume an intensive, scientific\r\ncharacter, to supply the increasing demand for food. The land, fixed in\r\nthe amount of area, must be made elastic in its productivity by the\r\napplication of intelligence and industry. Hence in island habitats, an\r\nearly development of agriculture, accompanied by a parallel skill in\r\nexploiting the food resources of the sea, is a prevailing feature. In\r\nOceanica, agriculture is everywhere indigenous, but shows greatest\r\nprogress in islands like Tonga and Fiji, where climate and soil are\r\nneither lavish nor niggardly in their gifts, but yield a due return for\r\nthe labor of tillage. The Society[964] and Samoan Islands, where nature\r\nhas been more prodigal, rank lower in agriculture, though George Forster\r\nfound in Tahiti a relatively high degree of cultivation.[965] The small,\r\nrocky, coralline Paumotas rank lower still, but even here plantains,\r\nsugar-cane, sweet potatoes, yams, taro and solanum are raised. The\r\ncrowded atolls of the Gilbert group show pains-taking tillage. Here we\r\nfind coco-palms with their roots fertilized with powdered pumice, and\r\ntaro cultivated in trenches excavated for the purpose and located near\r\nthe lagoons, so that the water may percolate through the coral sand to\r\nthe thirsty roots.[966] To lonely Easter Isle nature has applied a\r\nrelentless lash. At the time of Cook's visit it was woodless and\r\nboatless except for one rickety canoe, and therefore was almost excluded\r\nfrom the food supplies of the sea. Hence its destitute natives, by means\r\nof careful and often ingenious tillage, made its parched and rocky\r\nslopes support excellent plantations of bananas and sugar-cane.[967]\r\n\r\nThe islands of Melanesia show generally fenced fields, terrace farming\r\non mountain sides, irrigation canals, fertilized soils, well trimmed\r\nshade trees and beautiful flower gardens,[968] proof that the\r\ncultivation of the ground has advanced to the aesthetic stage, as it has\r\nin insular Japan. In Tonga the coco-palm plantations are weeded and\r\nmanured. Here, after a devastating war, the victorious chief devotes his\r\nattention to the cultivation of the land, which soon assumes a beautiful\r\nand flourishing appearance.[969] In Tongatabu, which is described by the\r\nearly visitors as one big garden, Cook found officials appointed to\r\ninspect all produce of the island and to enforce the cultivation of a\r\ncertain quota of land by each householder.[970] Here agriculture is a\r\nnational concern.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Melanesian agriculture.]\r\n\r\nIn the minute land fragments which constitute Micronesia, fishing is\r\nthe chief source of subsistence; agriculture, especially for the all\r\nimportant taro, is limited to the larger islands like the Pelews. In the\r\nvast islands of western Melanesia, agriculture is on the whole less\r\nadvanced. New Guinea, where the chase yields support to many villages,\r\nhas large sections still a wilderness, though some parts are cultivated\r\nlike a garden. In the smaller Melanesian islands, such as New Hebrides,\r\nNew Britain and the Solomon group, we find extensive plantations laid\r\nout on irrigated terraces, In New Hebrides and the Banks Islands every\r\nsingle village has its flowers and aromatic herbs.[971] But it is in\r\nFiji that native island agriculture seems to culminate. Here a race of\r\ndark, frizzly haired savages, addicted to cannibalism, have in the art\r\nof tillage taken a spurt forward in civilization, till in this respect\r\nthey stand abreast of the average European. The German asparagus bed is\r\nnot cultivated more carefully than the yam plants of Fiji; these also\r\nare grown in mounds made of soil which has been previously pulverized by\r\nhand. The variety and excellence of their vegetable products are\r\namazing, and find their reflection in an elaborate national cuisine,\r\nstrangely at variance with the otherwise savage life.[972]\r\n\r\nWest of Melanesia, the Malay Archipelago shows a high average of\r\ntillage. The inhabitants of Java, Madura, Bali, Lombok and Sumbawa are\r\nskilled agriculturists and employ an elaborate system of\r\nirrigation,[973] but the natives of Timor, on the other hand, have made\r\nlittle progress. In the Philippines a rich and varied agriculture has\r\nbeen the chief source of wealth since the Spanish conquest early in the\r\nsixteenth century, proving a native aptitude which began to develop long\r\nbefore.[974]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Intensive tillage.]\r\n\r\nThe dense population of the Mediterranean islands is the concomitant of\r\nan advanced agriculture. The connection between elaborate tillage and\r\nscant insular area is indicated in the earliest history of classic\r\nAegina. The inhabitants of this island were called Myrmidons, Strabo\r\ntells us, because by digging like ants they covered the rocks with earth\r\nto cultivate all the ground; and in order to economize the soil for this\r\npurpose, lived in excavations under ground and abstained from the use\r\nof bricks.[975] To-day, terraced slopes, irrigation, hand-made soils,\r\nhoe and spade tillage, rotation of crops, and a rich variety of field\r\nand garden products characterize the economic history of most\r\nMediterranean islands, whether Elba, the Lipari, Ponza, Procida, Capri,\r\nIschia, Pantellaria, Lampedusa,[976] or the Aegean groups. The sterile\r\nrock of Malta has been converted for two-thirds of its area into fertile\r\ngardens, fields and orchards. The upper stratum of rock has been\r\npulverized and enriched by manure; the surface has been terraced and\r\nwalled to protect it against high winds. In consequence, the Maltese\r\ngardens are famous throughout the Mediterranean.[977] In the Cyclades\r\nevery patch of tillable ground is cultivated by the industrious\r\ninhabitants. Terraced slopes are green with orchards of various southern\r\nfruits, and between the trees are planted melons and vegetables. Fallow\r\nland and uncultivated hillsides, as well as the limestone islands fit\r\nonly for pastures, are used for flocks of sheep and goats.[978]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Japanese agriculture.]\r\n\r\nIt is in Japan that agriculture has attained a national and aesthetic\r\nimportance reached nowhere else. Of the 150,000 square miles\r\nconstituting Japan proper, two-thirds are mountains; large tracts of\r\nlowlands are useless rock wastes, owing to the detritus carried down by\r\ninundating mountain torrents.[979] Hence to-day arable land forms only\r\n15.7 per cent. of the whole area. During the two hundred and fifty years\r\nof exclusion when emigration and foreign trade were forbidden, a large\r\nand growing population had to be supplied from a small insular area,\r\nfurther restricted by reason of the configuration of the surface. Here\r\nthe geographical effects of a small, naturally defined area worked out\r\nto their logical conclusion, Consequently agriculture progressed rapidly\r\nand gave the farmer a rank in the social scale such as he attained\r\nnowhere else.[980] His methods of tillage are much the same as in\r\novercrowded China, but his national importance and hence his ranking in\r\nsociety is much higher. In Japan to-day farming absorbs 60 per cent. of\r\nthe population. The system of tillage, in many respects primitive, is\r\nyet very thorough, and by means of skilful manuring makes one plot of\r\nground yield two or three crops per annum.[981] Every inch of arable\r\nland is cultivated in grain, vegetables and fruits. Mountains and hills\r\nare terraced and tilled far up their slopes. Meadows are conspicuously\r\nabsent, as are also fallow fields. Land is too valuable to lie idle.\r\nLabor is chiefly manual and is shared by the women and children; mattock\r\nand hoe are more common than the plow.[982] Such elaborate cultivation\r\nand such pressure of population eventuate in small holdings. In Japan\r\none hectar (2 1-2 acres) is the average farm per family.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The case of England.]\r\n\r\nWhile Japan's agriculture reflected the small area of an island\r\nenvironment, and under its influence reached a high development,\r\nEngland's from the beginning of the fifteenth century declined before\r\nthe competition of English commerce, which gained ascendency owing to\r\nthe easy accessibility of Great Britain to the markets of Europe. The\r\nravages of the Black Death in the latter half of the fourteenth century\r\nproduced a scarcity of agricultural laborers and hence a prohibitive\r\nincrease of wages. To economize labor, the great proprietors resorted to\r\nsheep farming and the raising of wool, which, either in the raw state or\r\nmanufactured into cloth, became the basis of English foreign trade. A\r\ndistinct deterioration in agriculture followed this reversion to a\r\npastoral basis of economic life, supplemented by a growing commerce\r\nwhich absorbed all the enterprise of the country. The steady contraction\r\nof the area under tillage threw out of employment the great mass of\r\nagricultural laborers, made them paupers and vagrants.[983] Hence\r\nEngland entered the period of maritime discoveries with a redundant\r\npopulation. This furnished the raw material for her colonies, and made\r\nher territorial expansion assume a solid, permanent character, unknown\r\nto the flimsy trading stations which mark the mere extension of a field\r\nof commerce.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Emigration and colonization from islands.]\r\n\r\nEven when agriculture, fisheries and commerce have done their utmost, in\r\nthe various stages of civilization, to increase the food supply, yet\r\ninsular populations tend to outgrow the means of subsistence procurable\r\nfrom their narrow base. Hence islanders, like peninsula peoples, are\r\nprone to emigrate and colonize. This tendency is encouraged by their\r\nmobility, born of their nautical skill and maritime location. King\r\nMinos of Crete, according to Thucydides and Aristotle, colonized the\r\nCyclades.[984] Greece, from its redundant population, peopled various\r\nAegean and Ionian islands, which in turn threw off spores of settlements\r\nto other isles and shores. Corcyra, which was colonized from the\r\nPeloponnesus, sent out a daughter colony to Epidamnos on the Illyrian\r\ncoast. Andros, one of the Cyclades, as early as 654 B.C., colonized\r\nAcanthus and Stagirus in Chalcidice.[985] Paros, settled first by\r\nCretans and then by Ionians, at a very early date sent colonies to\r\nThasos and to Parium on the Propontis, while Samos was a perennial\r\nfountain emitting streams of settlement to Thrace, Cilicia, Crete, Italy\r\nand Sicily. [Map page 251.]\r\n\r\nThis moving picture of Greek emigration is duplicated in the Malay\r\nArchipelago, especially in the smaller eastern islands. Almost every\r\nMalay tribe has traditions based upon migrations. The southern\r\nPhilippines derived the considerable Mohammedan element of their\r\npopulations from the Samal Laut, who came from Sumatra and the islands\r\nof the Strait of Malacca.[986] A Malayan strain can be traced through\r\nPolynesia to far-off Easter Isle. Sometimes the emigration is a\r\nvoluntary exile from home for a short period and a definite purpose. The\r\ninhabitants of Bouton, Binungku, and the neighboring islets, all of them\r\nlocated southeast of Celebes, have for the past twenty-five years come\r\nin great numbers to the larger islands of Ceram, Buru, Amboina and\r\nBanda, where they have laid out and carefully cultivated plantations of\r\nmaize, tobacco, bananas and coco-palms. Generally only the men come,\r\nwork two years, save their profits and then return home. These ambitious\r\ntillers look like savages, are shy as wild things of the woods, and work\r\nnaked to the waist.[987]\r\n\r\nPolynesia, Melanesia and Micronesia, where every condition of land and\r\nsea tends to develop the migratory spirit, form a region of extensive\r\ncolonization.[988] Settlements of one race are scattered among the\r\nisland groups of another, making the ethnic boundaries wide penumbras.\r\nIn some smaller islands of Melanesia the Polynesian colonists have\r\nexterminated or expelled the original inhabitants, and are found there\r\nnow with all their distinctive race characteristics; but in the larger\r\nislands, they have been merged in the resident population, and their\r\npresence is only to be surmised from the existence of Polynesian\r\ncustoms, such as father-right in New Hebrides and Solomon Island side\r\nby side with the prevailing Melanesian mother-right.[989] In small\r\nislands, like Tongatabu, Samoa and Fiji, emigration becomes habitual, a\r\ngradual spilling over of the redundant population and hence not a\r\nformidable inundation. In all this insular region of the Pacific, the\r\nimpulse to emigration is so persistent, that the resulting inter-insular\r\ncolonization obliterates sharp distinctions of race; it annuls the\r\nsegregation of an island environment, and makes everywhere for\r\namalgamation and unification, rather than differentiation.[990]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Modern emigration from islands.]\r\n\r\nAmong highly civilized peoples, where better economic methods bring\r\ngreater density of population and set at the same time a higher standard\r\nof living, emigration from islands is especially marked. Japan has seen\r\na formidable exodus since an end was put to its long period of\r\ncompression. This has taken the form of widespread emigration to various\r\nforeign lands, notably the Hawaiian Islands and the United States, and\r\nalso of internal colonization in its recently acquired territory in\r\nFormosa and Korea.[991] The Maltese have spread from their congested\r\nisland, and are found to-day as gardeners, sailors and traders along all\r\nthe Mediterranean coasts.[992] Majorca and the more barren Cyclades[993]\r\ntell the same story. The men of Capri go in considerable numbers to\r\nSouth America, but generally return home again. The Icelanders often\r\npull themselves out of the stagnation of their lonely, ungenerous island\r\nto become thrifty citizens of western Canada.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Maritime enterprise as outlet.]\r\n\r\nEmigration from islands readily throws itself into the channel of\r\nnavigation and foreign trade. The northern Sporades, especially Skiathos\r\nand Skopelos, are the home of sailors who can be found over all the\r\nworld.[994] In this appetency for a nautical career, small inshore\r\nislets are often distinguished from the nearby mainland. Nearly all the\r\nmasculine population of the Frisian Islands were seamen prior to 1807.\r\nIn the eighteenth century a third of the Hamburg vessels were commanded\r\nby captains from the little island of Sylte, and a third of the\r\nGreenland fleet of the Netherlands by natives of Föhr.[995]\r\n\r\nIn England the exodus took the form of trading expeditions and the\r\nfoundation of commercial colonies long before the food resources of the\r\nisland had been even considerably developed. The accessible sea offered\r\nlines of least resistance, while the monopoly of the land by a\r\nprivileged aristocracy and the fiercely defended corn laws made the\r\nlimitations of a small area more oppressive. In Ireland, a landless\r\npeasantry in a grainless land, dulled by deprivation of opportunity,\r\nfound in emigration an escape from insupportable evils.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Artificial checks to population.]\r\n\r\nWhile emigration draws off the surplus population, there tend to develop\r\nin islands, as also in barren highlands where population early reaches\r\nthe point of saturation, various devices to restrict natural increase.\r\nThe evils of congestion are foreseen and guarded against. Abbé Raynal,\r\nwriting of islanders in general, remarked as far back as 1795, \"It is\r\namong these people that we trace the origin of that multitude of\r\nsingular institutions which retards the progress of population.\r\nAnthropophagy, the castration of males, the infibulation of females,\r\nlate marriages, the consecration of virginity, the approbation of\r\ncelibacy, the punishments exercised against girls who become mothers at\r\ntoo early an age,\" he enumerates as such checks. Malthus, in his Essay\r\non Population, commenting on this statement, notes that the bounds to\r\nthe number of inhabitants on islands, especially small ones, are so\r\nnarrow and so obvious that no one can ignore them.[996]\r\n\r\nThe checks to population practiced on islands are either preventive or\r\npositive. The extreme measure to restrict marriage is found among the\r\nwretched Budumas who inhabit the small, marshy islands of Lake Chad.\r\nTribal custom allows only the chiefs and headmen to have wives. A brass\r\ncrescent inserted in the ear of a boy indicates the favored one among a\r\nchief's sons destined to carry on his race. For his brothers this is\r\nmade physically impossible; they become big, dull, timid creatures\r\ncontributing by their fishing to the support of the thinly populated\r\nvillages. The natives of the Shari River delta on the southern shore of\r\nLake Chad use Buduma as a term of contempt for a man.[997]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Polyandry.]\r\n\r\nIn islands, as in unproductive highlands where hunger stalks abroad,\r\nmarriage readily takes the form of polyandry. On the Canary Islands, at\r\nthe time of their conquest in 1402, polyandry existed in Lancerote and\r\npossibly in Fuerteventura, often assigning one woman to three husbands;\r\nbut in the other islands of the group monogamy was strictly\r\nmaintained.[998] In Oceanica polygamy, monogamy or polyandry prevails\r\naccording to a man's means, the poverty of the islands, and the supply\r\nof women. A plurality of wives is always the privilege of the chiefs and\r\nthe wealthy, but all three forms of marriage may be found on the same\r\nisland. Scarcity of women gives rise to polyandry in Tahiti,[999] and\r\nconsigns one woman to four or five men. In old Hawaii, where there were\r\nfour or five men to one woman a kind of incipient polyandry arose by the\r\naddition of a countenanced paramour to the married couple's\r\nestablishment.[1000] Robert Louis Stevenson found the same complaisant\r\narrangement a common one in the Marquesas, where the husband's deputy\r\nwas designated by the term of _pikio_ in the native vocabulary.[1001]\r\nPolyandry existed in Easter Isle, among whose stunted and destitute\r\npopulation the men far exceeded the women, and children were few,\r\naccording to reports of the early visitors.[1002] Numerous other\r\ninstances make this connection between island habitat, deficiency of\r\nwomen, need of checking increase, and polyandrous marriages an obvious\r\none.[1003]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Infanticide.]\r\n\r\nThis disproportion of the sexes in Oceanica is due to the murder of\r\nfemale infants, too early child-bearing, overwork, privation,\r\nlicentiousness, and the violence of the men.[1004] The imminence of\r\nfamine dictates certain positive checks to population, among which\r\ninfanticide and abortion are widespread in Oceanica. In some parts of\r\nthe New Hebrides and the Solomon groups it is so habitual, that in some\r\nfamilies all children are killed, and substitutes purchased at\r\nwill.[1005] In the well-tilled Fiji Islands, a pregnant girl is strangled\r\nand her seducer slain. The women make a practice of drinking medicated\r\nwaters to produce sterility. Failing in this, the majority kill their\r\nchildren either before or after birth. In the island of Vanua Levu\r\ninfanticide reaches from one-half to two-thirds of all children\r\nconceived; here it is reduced to a system and gives employment to\r\nprofessional murderers of babies, who hover like vultures over every\r\nchild-bed. All destroyed after birth are females.[1006] And yet here, as\r\non many other islands of Melanesia and Polynesia, such offspring as are\r\nspared are treated with foolish fondness and indulgence.[1007] The two\r\nfacts are not incompatible.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Approved by the state.]\r\n\r\nGeographic conditions made infanticide a state measure in these crowded\r\ncommunities. On the small coral atolls, where the food supply was\r\nscantest, it was enforced by law. On Vaitupu, in the Ellice group, only\r\ntwo children were allowed to a couple; on Nukufelau, only one. Any\r\nviolation of this unique sumptuary law was punished by a fine.[1008] On\r\nthe congested Gilbert atolls, a woman rarely had more than two children,\r\nnever more than three. Abortion, produced by a regular midwife, disposed\r\nof any subsequent offspring. Affection for children was very strong\r\nhere, and infanticide of the living was unknown.[1009] In Samoa, also,\r\nTurner found the practice restricted to the period before birth; but in\r\nTahiti and elsewhere it was enforced by the tribal village authorities\r\non the born and unborn.[1010] In pre-Christian Hawaii, two-thirds of all\r\nchildren, and especially girls, were killed by their parents either\r\nbefore or after birth. The result was a decay of the maternal instinct\r\nand the custom of farming out children to strangers. This contributed to\r\nthe excess of infant mortality, the degeneration of morals and the\r\ninstability of the family.[1011] So in Japan the pressure of population\r\nled to infanticide and the sale of daughters to a life of ignominy,\r\nwhich took them out of the child-bearing class.[1012] Nor was either\r\ncustom under the ban.\r\n\r\nThe result is a deterioration of morals, an invasion of the family bond,\r\nand a decay of the finer sentiments therewith connected. Captain Cook in\r\n1770 found in Tahiti _Eareeoie_ or _Arreoys_ societies, which were\r\nfree-love associations including in their number \"over half of the\r\nbetter sort of the inhabitants.\" The children begotten of these\r\npromiscuous unions were smothered at birth. Obscene conversations,\r\nindecent dances and frank unchastity on the part of girls and women were\r\nthe attendant evils of these loose morals.[1013] Cook was sure that\r\n\"these societies greatly prevent the increase of the superior classes of\r\npeople of which they are composed.\" Malthus reports a similar\r\nassociation in the Marianne Islands, distinguished by a similar name,\r\ndevoted to race suicide.[1014] Everywhere in Oceanica marriage is\r\nunstable, and with few exceptions unchastity prevails. Stevenson thinks\r\nit chiefly accountable for the decline of population in the\r\nislands.[1015] However, in the detailed _taboos_ laid upon women in Fiji,\r\nMarquesas, and other Polynesian islands we have the survival of an early\r\nmeasure to increase reserve between the sexes, long after regard for\r\nchastity has vanished.[1016]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Low valuation of human life.]\r\n\r\nThe constant pressure of population upon the limits of subsistence\r\nthroughout Oceanica has occasioned a low valuation of human life. Among\r\nnatural peoples the helpless suffer first. The native Hawaiians, though\r\na good-natured folk, were relentless towards the aged, weak, sick, and\r\ninsane. These were frequently stoned to death or allowed to perish of\r\nhunger.[1017] In Fiji, the aged are treated with such contempt, that when\r\ndecrepitude or illness threatens them, they beg their children to\r\nstrangle them, unless the children anticipate the request.[1018] In Vate\r\n(or Efate) of the New Hebrides, old people are buried alive, and their\r\npassage to another world duly celebrated by a feast.[1019] However, in\r\nthe Tonga Islands and in New Zealand, great respect and consideration\r\nare shown the aged as embodying experience.[1020] The harsher custom\r\nrecalls an ancient law of Aegean Ceos, which, ordained that all persons\r\nover sixty years of age should be compelled to drink hemlock, in order\r\nthat there might be sufficient food for the rest.[1021]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cannibalism in islands.]\r\n\r\nMany customs of Oceanica can be understood only in the light of the\r\nsmall value attached to human life in this island world. The\r\noverpopulation which lies back of their colonization explains the human\r\nsacrifices in their religious orgies and funeral rites, as also the\r\nwidespread practice of cannibalism. This can be traced in vestigial\r\nforms, or as an occasional or habitual custom from one end of the\r\nPacific to the other, from the Marquesas to New Guinea and from New\r\nZealand to Hawaii. All Melanesia is tainted with it, and Micronesia is\r\nnot above suspicion. The cause of this extensive practice, Stevenson\r\nattributes to the imminence of famine and the craving for flesh as food\r\nin these small islands, which are destitute of animals except fowls,\r\ndogs and hogs. In times of scarcity cannibalism threatens all; it\r\nstrikes from within or without the clan.[1022] Ratzel leans to the same\r\nopinion.[1023] Captain Cook thought the motive of a good full meal of\r\nhuman flesh was often back of the constant warfare in New Zealand, and\r\nwas sometimes the only alternative of death by hunger. Cannibalism was\r\nnot habitual in the Tonga Islands, but became conspicuous during periods\r\nof famine.[1024] In far-away Tierra del Fuego, where a peculiarly harsh\r\nclimate and the low cultural status of the natives combine to produce a\r\nfrightful infant mortality and therefore to repress population,\r\ncannibalism within the clan is indulged in only at the imperious dictate\r\nof mid-winter hunger. The same thing is true in the nearby Chonos\r\nArchipelago.[1025]\r\n\r\nThese are the darker effects of an island habitat, the vices of its\r\nvirtues. That same excessive pressure of population which gives rise to\r\ninfanticide also stimulates agriculture, industry and trade; it develops\r\ningenuity in making the most of local resources, and finally leads to\r\nthat widespread emigration and colonization which has made islanders the\r\ngreat distributors of culture, from Easter Isle to Java and from ancient\r\nCrete to modern England.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n[803] Table of areas of peninsulas and islands, Justus Perthes, _Taschen\r\nAtlas_, p. 9.

The relief of the sea floor influences man only indirectly. It\r\ndoes this by affecting the forms of the coast, by contributing to the\r\naction of tides in scouring out river estuaries, as on the flat beaches\r\nof Holland and England, by determining conditions for the abundant\r\nlittoral life of the sea, the fisheries of the continental shelf which\r\nare factors in the food quest and the distribution of settlements.\r\nMoreover, the ocean floor enters into the problem of laying telegraph\r\ncables, and thereby assumes a certain commercial and political\r\nimportance. The name of the Telegraph Plateau of the North Atlantic,\r\ncrossed by three cables, points to the relation between these and\r\nsubmarine relief. So also does the erratic path of the cable from\r\nsouthwestern Australia to South Africa via Keeling Island and Mauritius.\r\n\r\nSubmarine reliefs have yet greater significance in their relation to the\r\ndistribution of the human race over the whole earth; for what is now a\r\nshallow sea may in geologically recent times have been dry land, on\r\nwhich primitive man crossed from continent to continent. It is vital to\r\nthe theory of the Asiatic origin of the American Indian that in Miocene\r\ntimes a land bridge spanned the present shallows of Bering Sea. Hence\r\nthe slight depth of this basin has the same bio-geographical\r\nsignificance as that of the British seas, the waters of the Malay\r\nArchipelago, and the Melanesian submarine platform. The impressive fact\r\nabout \"Wallace's Line\" is the depth of the narrow channel which it\r\nfollows through Lombok and Macassar Straits and which, in recent\r\ngeological times, defined the southeastern shore of Asia. In all these\r\nquestions of former land connection, anthropo-geography follows the lead\r\nof bio-geography, whose deductions, based upon the dispersal of\r\ncountless plant and animal forms, point to the paths of human\r\ndistribution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mean elevations of the continents.]\r\n\r\nThe mean elevation of the continents above sea level indicates the\r\naverage life conditions of their populations as dependent upon relief.\r\nThe 1010 meters (3313 feet) of Asia indicate its predominant highland\r\ncharacter. The 330 meters (1080 feet) representing the average height of\r\nEurope, and the 310 meters (1016 feet) of Australia indicate the\r\npreponderance of lowlands. Nevertheless, anthropo-geography rarely lends\r\nitself to a mathematical statement of physical conditions. Such a\r\nstatement only obscures the facts. The 660 meters (2164 feet) mean\r\nelevation of Africa indicates a relief higher than Europe, but gives no\r\nhint of the plateau character of the Dark Continent, in which lowlands\r\nand mountains are practically negligible features; while the almost\r\nidentical figure (650 meters or 2133 feet) for both North and South\r\nAmerica is the average derived from extensive lowlands in close\r\njuxtaposition to high plateaus capped by lofty mountain ranges. Such\r\nmathematical generalizations indicate the general mass of the\r\ncontinental upheaval, but not the way this mass is divided into low and\r\nhigh reliefs.[1026]\r\n\r\nThe method of anthropo-geography is essentially analytical, and\r\ntherefore finds little use for general orometric statements, which may\r\nbe valuable to the science of geo-morphology with its radically\r\ndifferent standpoint. For instance, geo-morphology may calculate from\r\nall the dips and gaps in the crest of a mountain range the average\r\nheight of its passes, Anthropo-geography, on the other hand,\r\ndistinguishes between the various passes according as they open lines of\r\ngreater or less resistance to the historical movement across the\r\nmountain barriers. It finds that one deep breach in the mountain wall,\r\nlike the Mohawk Depression[1027] and Cumberland Gap in the Appalachian\r\nsystem,[1028] Truckee Pass in the Sierra Nevada[1029] and the Brenner in\r\nthe Alps,[1030] has more far-reaching and persistent historical\r\nconsequences than a dozen high-laid passes that only notch the crest.\r\nPack-trail, road and railroad seek the former, avoid the latter; one\r\ndraws from a wide radius, while the other serves a restricted local\r\nneed. Therefore anthropo-geography, instead of clumping the passes,\r\nsorts them out, and notes different relations in each.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Distribution of reliefs.]\r\n\r\nIn continents and countries the anthropo-geographer looks to see not\r\nwhat reliefs are present, but how they are distributed; whether\r\nhighlands and lowlands appear in unbroken masses as in Asia, or\r\nalternate in close succession as in western Europe; whether the\r\ntransition from one to the other is abrupt as in western South America,\r\nor gradual as in the United States. A simple and massive land structure\r\nlends the same trait of the simple and massive to every kind of\r\nhistorical movement, because it collects the people into large groups\r\nand starts them moving in broad streams, as it were. This fact explains\r\nthe historical preponderance of lowland peoples and especially of steppe\r\nnomads over the small, scattered groups inhabiting isolated mountain\r\nvalleys. The island of Great Britain illustrates the same principle on a\r\nsmall scale in the turbid, dismembered history of independent Scotland,\r\nwith its Highlanders and Lowlanders, its tribes and clans separated by\r\nmountains, gorges, straits, and fiords,[1031] in contrast to the smoother,\r\nunified course of history in the more uniform England. Carl Ritter\r\ncompares the dull uniformity of historical development and relief in\r\nAfrica with the variegated assemblage of highlands and lowlands, nations\r\nand peoples, primitive societies and civilized states in the more\r\nstimulating environment of Asia.[1032]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Homologous relief and homologous histories.]\r\n\r\nThe chief features of mountain relief reappear on a large scale in the\r\ncontinents, which are simply big areas of upheaval lifted above sea\r\nlevel. The continents show therefore homologous regions of lowlands,\r\nuplands, plateaus and mountains, each district sustaining definite\r\nrelations to the natural terrace above or below it, and displaying a\r\nhistory corresponding to that of its counterpart in some distant part of\r\nthe world, due to a similarity of relations. This appears first in a\r\nspecialization of products in each tier and hence in more or less\r\neconomic interdependence, especially where civilization is advanced. The\r\ntendency of conquest to unite such obviously complementary districts is\r\npersistent. Hence the Central Highland of Asia is fringed with low\r\nperipheral lands like Manchuria, China, India and Mesopotamia, into\r\nwhose history it has repeatedly entered as a disturbing force. All the\r\nnarrow Pacific districts of the Americas from Alaska to Patagonia are\r\nseparated by the Cordilleras from the lowlands on the Atlantic face of\r\nthe continents; all reveal in their history the common handicap arising\r\nfrom an overwhelming preponderance of plateau and mountain and a paucity\r\nof lowlands. Colombia, Ecuador and Peru have in the past century been\r\nstretching out their hands eastward to grasp sections of the bordering\r\nAmazon lowlands, where to-day is the world's great field of conflicting\r\nboundary claims. Chile would follow its geographical destiny if it\r\nshould supplement its high, serrated surface by the plateaus and\r\nlowlands of Bolivia, as Cyrus the Persian married the Plateau of Iran to\r\nthe plains of the Tigris and Euphrates, and Romulus joined the Alban\r\nhills to the alluvial fields of the Tiber.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Anthropo-geography of lowlands.]\r\n\r\nWell-watered lowlands invite expansion, ethnic, commercial and\r\npolitical. In them the whole range of historical movements meet few\r\nobstacles beyond the waters gathering in their runnels and the forests\r\nnourished in their rich soils. Limited to 200 meters (660 feet)\r\nelevation, lowlands develop no surface features beyond low hills and\r\nundulating swells of land. Uniformity of life conditions, monotony of\r\nclimate as of relief, except where grades of latitude intervene to chill\r\nor heat, an absence of natural boundaries, and constant encouragement to\r\nintercourse, are the anthropo-geographic traits of lowlands, as opposed\r\nto the arresting, detaining grasp of mountains and highland valleys.\r\nSmall, isolated lowlands, like the mountain-rimmed plains of Greece and\r\nthe Aegean coast of Asia Minor, the Nile flood-plain, Portugal, and\r\nAndalusia in Spain, may achieve precocious and short-lived historical\r\nimportance, owing to the fertility of their alluvial soils, their\r\ncharacter as naturally defined districts, and their advantageous\r\nmaritime location; but while in these restricted lowlands the telling\r\nfeature has been their barrier boundaries of desert, mountains and sea,\r\nthe vast level plains of the earth have found their distinctive and\r\nlasting historical importance in the fact of their large and unbounded\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nSuch plains have been both source and recipient of every form of\r\nhistorical movement. Owing to their prevailing fitness for agriculture,\r\ntrade and intercourse, they are favored regions for the final massing of\r\na sedentary population. The areas of greatest density of population in\r\nthe world, harboring 150 or more to the square kilometer (385 to the\r\nsquare mile), are found in the lowlands of China, the alluvial plains of\r\nIndia, and similar level stretches in the Neapolitan plain and Po\r\nValley, the lowlands of France, Germany, Holland, Belgium, England and\r\nScotland. Such a density is found in upland districts (660 to 2000 feet,\r\nor 200 to 600 meters) bordering agricultural lowlands, only where\r\nindustries based upon mineral wealth cause a concentration of\r\npopulation. [See maps pages 8, 9, 559.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Extensive plains unfavorable to early development.]\r\n\r\nThe level or undulating surface of extensive lowlands is not favorable\r\nto the early development of civilization. Not only do their wide extent\r\nand absence of barriers postpone the transition from nomadism to\r\nsedentary life, but their lack of contrasting environments and\r\ncontrasted developments, which supplement and stimulate, puts chains\r\nupon progress. A flat, monotonous relief produces a monotonous\r\nexistence, necessarily one-sided, needing a complement in upland or\r\nmountain. To the pioneer settlers in the lowlands of Missouri the Ozark\r\nPlateau was a boon, because its streams furnished water-power for much\r\nneeded saw and flour mills. Treeless Egypt even before 2500 B. C.\r\ndepended upon the cedars of the Lebanon Mountains for the construction\r\nof its ships; so that the conquest of Lebanon, begun by Thutmose I. and\r\ncompleted by Thutmose III. in about 1470 B. C., had a sound geographical\r\nbasis.[1033] Similarly the exploitation of the copper, malachite, turquoise\r\nand lapis-lazuli of Mount Sinai, minerals not found in the Nile plain,\r\nled the ancient Egyptians into extensive mining operations there before\r\n3000 B. C., and resulted in the establishment of Egyptian political\r\nsupremacy in 2900 B. C., as a measure to protect the mines against the\r\ndepredations of the neighboring Bedouin tribes.[1034] Lowlands lack the\r\ndistinctive advantages of highlands found in diversity of climate,\r\nwater-power, generally in more abundant forests and minerals. The latter\r\nare earlier discovered and worked in the tilted strata of mountains and\r\nuplands.\r\n\r\nPlain countries suffer particularly from a paucity of varied geographic\r\nconditions and of resulting contrasts in their population. Their\r\nnational characters tend to be less richly endowed; their possibilities\r\nfor development are blighted or retarded, because even racial\r\ndifferences are rapidly obliterated in the uniform geographic\r\nenvironment, A small diversified country like Crete, Great Britain,\r\nItaly, Portugal, Saxony, or Japan, is a geographical _multum in parvo_.\r\nThe western half of Europe bears the same stamp, endowing each country\r\nand nation with marked individuality born of partial isolation and a\r\nvaried combination of environment. The larger eastern half of the\r\ncontinent embraced in the plains of Poland and Russia shows monotony in\r\nevery aspect of human life. This comes out anthropologically in the\r\nstriking similarity of head-form found everywhere north and east of the\r\nCarpathian Mountains, except in the secluded districts of Lithuania and\r\nCrimea, which shelter remnants of distinct races. Over all this vast\r\nterritory the range of cephalic variation is only five units or\r\none-third that in the restricted but diversified territory of western\r\nEurope. Italy, only one-eighteenth the size of European Russia, has a\r\nrange of fifteen units, reflecting in the variety of its human types the\r\ndiversity of its environment.[1035]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Conditions for fusion in plains.]\r\n\r\nIn the plains geography makes for fusion. Russia shows this marked\r\nhomogeneity, despite a motley collection of race ingredients which have\r\nentered into the make-up of the Russian people. Without boundary or\r\nbarrier, the country has stood wide open to invasion; but the intruders\r\nfound no secluded corners where they could entrench themselves and\r\npreserve their national individuality.[1036] They dropped into a vast\r\nmelting-pot, which has succeeded in amalgamating the most diverse\r\nelements. The long-drawn Baltic-North Sea plain of Europe shows the same\r\npower to fuse. Here is found a prevailing blond, long-headed stock from\r\nthe Gulf of Finland to the Somme River in France.[1037] Yet this natural\r\nboulevard has been a passway for races. Prehistoric evidences show that\r\nthe dark, broad-headed Celtic folk once overspread this plain east to\r\nthe Weser;[1038] it still tends to trickle down from the southern uplands\r\ninto the Baltic lowland, and modify the Teutonic type along its southern\r\nmargin throughout Germany.[1039] The Slavs in historic times reached as\r\nfar west as the Weser, while the expansion of the Teutons has embraced\r\nthe whole maritime plain from Brittany to the Finnish Gulf. Here it is\r\ndifficult to draw an ethnic boundary on the basis of physical\r\ndifferences. The eastern Prussians are Slavonized Teutons, and the\r\nadjacent Poles seem to be Teutonized Slavs, while the purest type of\r\nLetto-Lithuanian at the eastern corner of the Baltic coast approximates\r\nclosely to the Anglo-Saxon type which sprang from the western\r\ncorner.[1040] A similar amalgamation of races and peoples has taken place\r\nin the lowlands of England and Scotland, while diversity still lingers\r\nin the highlands. In the Lowlands of Scotland, Picts in small numbers,\r\nBritons, Scots from Ireland, Angles, Frisians, Northmen and Danes have\r\nall been blended and assimilated in habits, customs and speech.[1041]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Retardation due to monotonous environment.]\r\n\r\nThis uniformity is advantageous to early development in a small plain,\r\nbecause of the juxtaposition of contrasted environments, but is\r\nstultifying to national life in an immense expanse of monotony like that\r\nof Russia. Here sameness leaves its stamp on everything. Language is\r\ndifferentiated with only two dialects, that of the Great Russians of the\r\nnorth and the Little Russians of the southern steppes, who were so long\r\nexposed to Tartar influences. Most other languages of Europe, though\r\nconfined to much smaller areas, show far greater diversity.[1042] While\r\nthe Russian of Kazan or Archangel can converse readily with the citizen\r\nof Riga or St. Petersburg, Germans from highland Bavaria and Swabia are\r\nscarcely intelligible to Prussian and Mecklenberger. And whereas Germany\r\na few decades ago could count over a hundred different kinds of national\r\ndress or _Tracht_, Great Russia alone, with six times the area, had only\r\na single type with perhaps a dozen slight variations. Leroy-Beaulieu\r\ncomments upon this eternal sameness. \"The cities are all alike; so are\r\nthe peasants, in looks, habits, in mode of life. In no country do people\r\nresemble one another more; no other country is so free from political\r\ncomplexity, those oppositions in type and character, which even yet we\r\nencounter in Italy and Spain, in France and Germany. The nation is made\r\nin the likeness of the country; it shows the same unity, we might say\r\nthe same monotony, as the plains on which it dwells.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Influence of soils in low plains.]\r\n\r\nThe more flat and featureless a lowland is, the more important become\r\neven the slightest surface irregularities which can draw faint dividing\r\nlines among the population. Here a gentle land-swell, river, lake,\r\nforest, or water-soaked moor serves as boundary. Especially apparent is\r\nthe differentiating influence of difference of soils. Gravel and\r\nalluvium, sand and clay, chalk and more recent marine sediments,\r\nemphasize small geographical differences throughout the North German\r\nlowland and its extension through Belgium and Holland; here various\r\nsoils differentiate the distribution of population. In the Netherlands\r\nwe find the Frisian element of the Dutch people inhabiting chiefly the\r\nclay soils and low fens of the west and northwest, the Saxon in the\r\ndiluvial tracts of the east, and the Frankish in the river clays and\r\ndiluvium of the south. All the types have maintained their differences\r\nof dialect, styles of houses, racial character, dress and custom.[1043]\r\nThe only distinctive region in the great western lowland of France,\r\nwhich comprises over half of the country, is Brittany, individualized in\r\nits people and history by its peninsula form, its remote western\r\nlocation, and its infertile soil of primary rocks. Within the\r\nsedimentary trough of the Paris Basin, a slight Cretacean platform like\r\nthe meadow land of Perche[1044] (200 to 300 meters elevation) introduces\r\nan area of thin population devoted to horse and cattle raising in close\r\nproximity to the teeming urban life of Paris. The eastern lowland of\r\nEngland also can be differentiated economically and historically chiefly\r\naccording to differences of underlying rocks, Carboniferous, Triassic,\r\nJurassic, chalk, boulder clays, and alluvium, which also coincide often\r\nwith slight variations of relief.[1045] In Russia the contrast between the\r\nglaciated surface of the north and the Black Mould belt of the south\r\nmakes the only natural divisions of that vast country, unless we\r\ndistinguish also the arid southeastern steppes on the basis of a purely\r\nclimatic difference. [See map page 484.]\r\n\r\nThe broad coastal plain of our South Atlantic States contains only low\r\nreliefs; but it is diversified by several soil belts, which exert a\r\ndefinite control over the industries of the inhabitants, and thereby\r\nover the distribution of the negro population. In Georgia, for instance,\r\nthe rich alluvial soil of the swampy coast is devoted to the culture of\r\nrice and sea-island cotton, and contains over 60 per cent. of negroes in\r\nits population. This belt, which is only 25 miles wide, is succeeded\r\ninland by a broader zone of sandy pine barrens, where the proportion of\r\nnegroes drops to only 20 or 30 per cent. of the total. Yet further\r\ninland is another fertile belt, devoted chiefly to the cultivation of\r\nupland cotton and harboring from 35 to over 60 per cent. of negroes in\r\nits population.[1046] Alabama shows a similar stratification of soils and\r\npopulation from north to south over its level surface. Along the\r\nnorthern border of the state the cereal belt coincides with the deep\r\ncalcareous soil of the Tennessee River Valley, where negroes constitute\r\nfrom 35 to 60 per cent. of the inhabitants. Next comes the mineral belt,\r\ncovering the low foot-hills of the Appalachian Mountains. It contains\r\nthe densest population of the state, less than 17 per cent. of which is\r\nnegro. South of this is the broad cotton belt of various rich soils,\r\nchiefly deep black loam of the river bottoms, which stretches east and\r\nwest across the state and includes over 60 per cent. of negroes in its\r\npopulation. This is succeeded by the low, coastal timber belt, marked by\r\na decline in the quality of the soil and the proportion of negro\r\ninhabitants.[1047]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Value of slight elevations.]\r\n\r\nIn the dead level of extensive plains even slight elevations are seized\r\nupon for special uses, or acquire peculiar significance. The Kurgans or\r\nburial mounds of the prehistoric inhabitants of Russia, often twenty to\r\nfifty feet high, serve to-day as watch-towers for herdsmen tending their\r\nflocks.[1048] Similarly the Bou-bous, inhabiting the flat grasslands of\r\nthe French Congo between the Shari and Ubangui Rivers, use the low\r\nknolls dotted over their country, probably old ant-hills, as lookout\r\npoints against raiders.[1049] The sand hills and ridges which border the\r\nsouthern edges of the North German lowland form districts sharply\r\ncontrasted to the swampy, wooded depressions of the old deserted river\r\nvalleys just to the north. Early occupied by a German stock, they\r\nfurnished the first German colonists to displace the primitive Slav\r\npopulation surviving in those unattractive, inaccessible regions, as\r\nseen in the Spreewald near Kottbus to-day.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Plains and political expansion.]\r\n\r\nThe boundless horizon which is unfavorable to a nascent people endows\r\nthem in their belated maturity with the power of mastering large areas.\r\nPolitical expansion is the dominant characteristic of the peoples of the\r\nplains. Haxthausen observed that handicapped and retarded Russia\r\ncommands every geographic condition and national trait necessary for\r\nvirile and expansive political power.[1050] Muscovite expansion eastward\r\nacross the lowlands of Europe and Asia is paralleled by the rapid\r\nspread of American settlement and dominion across the plains and\r\nprairies of the Mississippi Valley, and Hungarian domination of the wide\r\nDanubian levels from the foot-hills of the Austrian Alps to the far\r\nCarpathian watershed. It was the closely linked lowlands of the Seine\r\nand Loire which formed the core of political expansion and\r\ncentralization in France. Nearly the whole northern lowland of Germany\r\nhas been gradually absorbed by the kingdom of Prussia, which now\r\ncomprises in its territory almost two-thirds of the total area of the\r\nEmpire. Prussian statesmen formulated the policy of German unification\r\nand colonial expansion, and to Prussia fell the hereditary headship of\r\nthe Empire.\r\n\r\nLowland states tend to stretch out and out to boundaries which depend\r\nmore upon the reach of the central authority than upon physical\r\nfeatures. We have seen American settlement and dominion overleap one\r\nnatural boundary after another between the Mississippi River and the\r\nPacific, from 1804 to 1848. Russia in an equally short period has pushed\r\nforward its Asiatic frontier at a dozen points, despite all barriers of\r\ndesert and mountain. Argentina, blessed with extensive plains, fertile\r\nsoil and temperate climate, which have served to augment its population\r\nboth by natural increase and steady immigration (one-fourth of its\r\npopulation is foreign), has expanded across the Rio Negro over the\r\ngrasslands of the Patagonian plain, and thereby enlarged its area by\r\n259,620 square miles since 1881. The statesman of the plains is a\r\nnature-made imperialist; he nurses wide territorial policies and draws\r\nhis frontiers for the future. To him a \"far-flung battle line\" is\r\nsignificant only as a means to secure a far-flung boundary line.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Arid plains.]\r\n\r\nFrom these low, accessible plains of adequate rainfall, which at first\r\nencourage primitive nomadism but finally make it yield to sedentary life\r\nand to dense populations spreading their farms and cities farther and\r\nfarther over the unresisting surface of the land, we turn to those\r\nboundless arid steppes and deserts which Nature has made forever the\r\nhomes of restless, rootless peoples. Here quiescence is impossible, the\r\n_Völkerwanderung_ is habitual, migration is permanent. The only change\r\nis this eternal restlessness. While the people move, progress stands\r\nstill. Everywhere the sun-scorched grasslands and waterless waste have\r\ndrawn the dead-line to the advance of indigenous civilization. They\r\npermit no accumulation of productive wealth beyond increasing flocks and\r\nherds, and limit even their growth by the food supply of scanty,\r\nscattered pasturage. The meager rainfall eliminates forests and\r\ntherewith a barrier to migrations; it also restricts vegetation to\r\ngrasses, sedges and those forms which can survive a prolonged summer\r\ndrought and require a short period of growth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANNUAL RAINFALL OF THE WORLD.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Distribution and extent of arid plains.]\r\n\r\nThe union of arid plains and steppe vegetation is based upon climate,\r\nand is therefore a widely distributed phenomenon. These plains, whether\r\nhigh or low, are found in their greatest extent in the dry trade-wind\r\nbelts, as in the deserts and steppes of Arabia, Persia, Sudan, the\r\nSahara, South Africa and Central Australia; and in vast continental\r\ninteriors, where the winds arrive robbed of their moisture in passing\r\nintervening highlands, as in the grasslands of our western plains, the\r\nllanos and pampas of South America, and the steppes of Central Asia. But\r\nwherever they occur, whether in Argentina or Russian Turkestan or the\r\nhigher plains of Mongolia and Tibet, they present the same general\r\ncharacteristics of land surface, climate, flora and fauna, and the same\r\nnomadic populations of pastoral or hunting tribes. In them the movement\r\nof peoples reaches its culminating point, permanent settlement its nil\r\npoint. Here the hunting savage makes the widest sweep in pursuit of\r\nbuffalo or antelope, and pauses least to till a field; here the pastoral\r\nnomad follows his systematic wandering in search of pasturage and his\r\nhardly less systematic campaigns of conquest. It is the vast area and\r\nwide distribution of these arid plains, combined with the mobility which\r\nthey impose on native human life, that has lent them historical\r\nimportance, and reproduced in all sections of the world that significant\r\nhomologous relation of arid and well-watered districts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pastoral life.]\r\n\r\nThe grasslands of the old world developed historical importance only\r\nafter the domestication of cattle, sheep, goats, asses, horses, camels\r\nand yaks. This step in progress resulted in the evolution of peoples\r\nwho renounced the precarious subsistence of the chase and escaped the\r\ndrudgery of agriculture, to devote themselves to pastoral life. It was\r\npossible only where domesticable animals were present, and where the\r\nintelligence of the native or the peculiar pressure exerted by\r\nenvironment suggested the change from a natural to an artificial basis\r\nof subsistence. Australia lacked the type of animal. Though North\r\nAmerica had the reindeer and buffalo, and South America the guanaco,\r\nllama and alpaca, only the last two were domesticated in the Andean\r\nhighlands; but as these were restricted to altitudes from 10,000 to\r\n14,000 feet, where pasturage was limited, stock raising in primitive\r\nSouth America was merely an adjunct to the sedentary agriculture of the\r\nhigh intermontane valleys, and never became the basis for pastoral\r\nnomadism on the grassy plains. However, when the Spaniards introduced\r\nhorses and cattle into South America, the Indians and half-breeds of the\r\nllanos and pampas became regular pastoral nomads, known as llaneros and\r\ngauchos. They are a race of horsemen, wielding javelin and lasso and\r\nbola, living on meat, often on horse-flesh like the ancient Huns,\r\ndwelling in leather tents made on a cane framework, like those of the\r\nmodern Kirghis and medieval Tartars, dressed in cloaks of horsehide sewn\r\ntogether, and raiding the Argentinian frontier of white settlement for\r\nhorses, sheep and cattle, with the true marauding instinct of all\r\nnomads.[1051]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pastoral nomads of Arctic plains.]\r\n\r\nAridity is not the only climatic condition condemning a people to\r\nnomadic life. Excessive cold, producing the tundra wastes of the far\r\nnorth, has the same effect. Therefore, throughout Arctic Eurasia, from\r\nthe Lapp district of Norway to the Inland Chukches of eastern Siberia,\r\nwe have a succession of Hyperborean peoples pasturing their herds of\r\nreindeer over the moss and lichen tundra, and supplementing their food\r\nsupply with hunting and fishing. The reindeer Chukches once confined\r\nthemselves to their peninsula, so long as the grazing grounds were\r\nunexhausted; but they now range as far west as Yakutsk on the Lena\r\nRiver, The Orochones of the Kolima River district in eastern Siberia,\r\nwho live chiefly by their reindeer, have small herds. A well-to-do\r\nperson will have 40 to 100 animals, and the wealthiest only 700, while\r\nthe Chukches with herds of 10,000 often seek the pasture of the Kolima\r\ntundra.[1052] Farther west, the Samoyedes of northern Siberia and Russia\r\nand the Zirians of the Petchora River range with their large herds\r\nnorthward to the Yalmal Peninsula and Vaygats Isle in summer, and\r\nsouthward in winter. [See map pages 103, 225.] Here a herd of fifty\r\nhead, which just suffices for the support of one family of four souls,\r\nrequires 10 square versts, or 4.44 square miles of tundra pasturage.[1053]\r\nHence population must forever remain too sparse ever to attain\r\nhistorical significance. [See map page 8.] The Russian Lapps, too, lead\r\na semi-nomadic life. Each group has a particular summer and winter\r\nsettlement. The winter village is located usually inland in the Kola\r\nPeninsula, where the forests lend shelter to the herds, and the summer\r\none near the tundra of the coast, where fishing is accessible. In\r\nwinter, like the nomads of the deserts, they add to their slender income\r\nby the transport of goods by their reindeer and by service at the post\r\nstations.[1054]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Historical importance of steppe nomads.]\r\n\r\nThese nomads of the frozen north, scattered sparsely over the remote\r\nperiphery of the habitable world, have lacked the historical importance\r\nwhich in all times has attached to the steppe nomads, owing to their\r\ncentral location. The broad belt of deserts and grasslands which crosses\r\nthe old world diagonally between 10° and 60° North Latitude from the\r\nAtlantic in Africa to the Pacific in Asia, either borders or encompasses\r\nthe old domains of culture found in river oases, alluvial lowlands or\r\ncoastal plains of the Torrid and Temperate Zones. The restless, mobile,\r\nunbound shepherds of the arid lands have never long been contained by\r\nthe country which bred them. They have constantly encroached upon the\r\nterritory of their better placed neighbors, invading, conquering,\r\nappropriating their fields and cities, disturbing but at the same time\r\nacquiring their culture, lording it over the passive agriculturists, and\r\nat the same time putting iron into their weaker blood. It is the\r\ngeographical contact between arid steppes and moist river valley,\r\nbetween land of poverty and land of plenty, that has made the history of\r\nthe two inseparable.[1055]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CULTURAL REGIONS OF AFRICA AND ARABIA.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mobility of pastoral nomads.]\r\n\r\nEvery aspect of human life in the steppes bears the stamp of mobility.\r\nThe nomad tolerates no clog upon his movements. His dwelling is the tent\r\nof skin or felt as among Kalmucks and Kirghis, or the tent wagon of the\r\nmodern Boer[1056] and the ancient Scythian as described by Herodotus.[1057]\r\n\"This device has been contrived by them as the country is fit for it,\"\r\nhe says,--level, grassy, treeless. The temporary settlement of shepherd\r\ntribes is the group of tents, or the ancient _carrago_ camp of the\r\nnomadic Visigoths,[1058] or the _laager_ of the pastoral Boers, both a\r\ncircular barricade or corral of wagons.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tendency to trek.]\r\n\r\nConstant movement reduces the impedimenta to a minimum. The Orochones, a\r\nTunguse nomadic tribe of eastern Siberia, have no furniture in their\r\ntents, and keep their meager supply of clothing and utensils neatly\r\npacked on sledges, as if to start at a moment's notice.[1059] The only\r\ndesirable form of capital is that which transports itself, namely,\r\nflocks and herds. Beyond that, wealth is limited to strictly portable\r\nforms, preferably silver, gold and jewels. It was in terms of these,\r\nbesides their herds, that the riches of Abraham and Lot were rated in\r\nthe Bible. That the Israelites when traveling through the wilderness\r\nshould have had the gold to make the golden calf accords strictly with\r\nthe verisimilitude of pastoral life.[1060] Moreover, that these enslaved\r\ndescendants of the Sheik Abraham, with their traditions of pastoral\r\nlife, should have simply trekked-ruptured the frail ties of recently\r\nacquired habit which bound them to the Nile soil, is also in keeping\r\nwith their inborn nomadic spirit. Similar instances occur among modern\r\npeoples. The Great Trek of the South African Boers in 1836, by which\r\nthey renounced not only their unwelcome allegiance to England, but also\r\ntheir land,[1061] was another exodus in accordance with the instinct of a\r\npastoral people. They adopted no strange or difficult course, but\r\ntraveled with their families as they were wont in their every day life\r\nof cattle-tenders, took all their chattels with them, and headed for the\r\nthin pastures of the far-reaching veldt. The Russian government has had\r\nto contend with a like fluidity in her Cossack tribes of the steppes,\r\nwho have been up and off when imperial authority became oppressive. In\r\nthe summer of 1878 West Siberia lost about 9000 Kirghis, who left the\r\nprovince Semipalatinsk to seek Mongolia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Seasonal migrations.]\r\n\r\nEnvironment determines the nomadic habits of the dweller of desert and\r\nsteppe. The distribution of pasture and water fixes the scope and the\r\nrate of his wandering; these in turn depend upon geographic conditions\r\nand vary with the season. The Papago Indians of southern Arizona range\r\nwith their cattle over a territory 100 by 150 miles in extent, and\r\nwander across the border into Mexico. When their main water supply,\r\nderived from wells or artificial reservoirs near their summer villages,\r\nis exhausted, they migrate to the water-holes, springs or streams in the\r\ncañons. There the cattle graze out on the plains and return to the\r\ncañons to drink.[1062] Every Mongol tribe and clan has its seasonal\r\nmigration. In winter the heavier precipitation and fuller streams enable\r\nthem to collect in considerable groups in protected valleys; but the dry\r\nsummer disperses them over the widest area possible, in order to utilize\r\nevery water-hole and grass spot. The hotter regions of the plains are\r\nabandoned in summer for highlands, where the short period of warmth\r\nyields temporary pastures and where alone water can be found. The\r\nKirghis of Russian Turkestan resort in summer to the slopes and high\r\nvalleys of the Altai Mountains, where their auls or tent villages may be\r\nseen surrounded by big flocks of sheep, goats, camels, horses and\r\ncattle.[1063] The Pamir in the warm months is the gathering place for the\r\nnomads of Central Asia. The naked desert of Arabia yields a rare herbage\r\nduring the rainy season, when the Bedouin tribes resort to it for\r\npasturage;[1064] but during the succeeding drought they scatter to the\r\nhills of Yemen, Syria and Palestine,[1065] or migrate to the valley of the\r\nNile and Euphrates.[1066] The Arabs of the northern Sahara, followed by\r\nsmall flocks of sheep and goats, vibrate between the summer pastures on\r\nthe slopes of the Atlas Mountains and the scant, wiry grass tufts found\r\nin winter on the borders of the desert.[1067] When the equatorial rains\r\nbegin in June, the Arabs of the Atbara River follow them north-westward\r\ninto the Nubian desert, and let their camel herds graze on the delicate\r\ngrass which the moisture has conjured up from the sandy soil. The\r\ncountry about Cassala, which is flooded during the monsoon rains by the\r\nrivers from the Abyssinian Mountains, is reserved for the dry\r\nseason.[1068] In the same way the Tartar tribes of the Dnieper, Don, Volga\r\nand Ural Rivers in the thirteenth century moved down these rivers in\r\nwinter to the sea coast, and in summer up-stream to the hills and\r\nmountains.[1069] So for the past hundred years the Boers of the South\r\nAfrican grasslands have migrated in their tent wagons from the higher to\r\nthe lower pastures, according to the season of the year, invading even\r\nthe Karroo Desert after the short summer rains.[1070]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marauding expeditions.]\r\n\r\nThis systematic movement of nomads within their accepted boundaries\r\nleads, on slight provocation, to excursions beyond their own frontiers\r\ninto neighboring territories. The growing herd alone necessitates the\r\nabsorption of more land, more water-holes, because the grazed pastures\r\nrenew their grass slowly under the prevailing conditions of drought. An\r\narea sufficient for the support of the tribe is inadequate for the\r\nsustenance of the herd, whose increase is a perennial expansive force.\r\nSoon the pastures become filled with the feeding flocks, and then\r\nherdsmen and herds spill over into other fields. Often a season of\r\nunusual drought, reducing the existing herbage which is scarcely\r\nadequate at best, gives rise to those irregular, temporary expansions\r\nwhich enlarge the geographical horizon of the horde, and eventuate in\r\nwidespread conquest. Such incursions, like the seasonal movements of\r\nnomads, result from the helpless dependence of shepherd tribes upon\r\nvariations of rainfall.\r\n\r\nThe nomad's basis of life is at best precarious. He and want are\r\nfamiliar friends. A pest among his herds, diminished pasturage, failing\r\nwells, all bring him face to face with famine, and drive him to robbery\r\nand pillage.[1071] Marauding tendencies are ingrained in all dwellers of\r\nthe deserts and steppes.[1072] Since the days of Job, the Bedouins of\r\nArabia have been a race of marauders; they have reduced robbery to a\r\nsystem. Predatory excursions figure conspicuously in the history of all\r\nthe tribes. Robber is a title of honor.[1073] Pliny said that the Arabs\r\nwere equally addicted to theft and trade. They pillaged caravans and\r\nheld them for ransom, or gave them safe conduct across the desert for a\r\nprice. Formerly the Turkoman tribes of the Trans-Caspian steppes levied\r\non the bordering districts, notably the northern part of Khorasan, which\r\nbelonged more to the Turkomans, Yomut and Goklan tribes of the adjoining\r\nsteppe than to the resident Persians. The border districts of Herat,\r\nKhiva, Merv and Bukhara used to suffer in the same way from the raids of\r\nthe Tekkes, till the Russians checked the evil.[1074] The Tekkes had\r\ndepopulated whole districts, invaded Persian towns of considerable size,\r\nand carried off countless families into slavery. Both Turkomans and\r\nKirghis tribes prior to 1873 raided caravans and carried off the\r\ntravelers to the slave markets of Bukhara and Samarkand.[1075] [See map\r\npage 103.]\r\n\r\nAmong these tribes no young man commanded respect in his community till\r\nhe had participated in a _baranta_ or cattle-raising.[1076] For centuries\r\nthe nomadic hordes of the Russian steppes systematically pillaged the\r\npeaceful agricultural Slavs, who were threatening to encroach upon their\r\npasture lands. The sudden, swift descent and swift retreat of the\r\nmounted marauders with the booty into the pathless grasslands, whither\r\npursuit was dangerous, their tendency to rob and conquer but never to\r\ncolonize, involved Russia in a long struggle, which ceased only with the\r\nextension of Muscovite dominion over the steppes.[1077]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Depredation and conquests of African nomads.]\r\n\r\nAll the Saharan tribes are marauders, whether Arabs, Berber Tuaregs, or\r\nNegroid Tibbus. The desert has made them so. The Tuaregs are chronic\r\nfreebooters; they keep the Sahara and especially the caravan routes in\r\nconstant insecurity. They stretch a cordon across these routes from\r\nGhadames and Ghat in the east to the great oases of Insalah and Twat in\r\nthe west; and from the oases and hills forming their headquarters they\r\nspread for pasturage and blackmail over the desert.[1078] They exact toll\r\nover and over again from a caravan, provide it with a military escort of\r\ntheir own tribesmen, and then pillage it on the way.[1079] This has been\r\nthe experience of Barth[1080] and other explorers. Caravans have not been\r\ntheir only prey. The agricultural peoples in the Niger flood-plain, the\r\ncommerce on the river, and the markets of Timbuctoo long suffered from\r\nthe raids of the Tuaregs of the Sahara. They collected tribute in the\r\nform of grain, salt, garments, horses and gold, typical needs of a\r\ndesert people, imposed tolls on caravans and on merchant fleets passing\r\ndown the Niger to Timbuctoo. In 1770 they began to move from the desert\r\nand appropriate the fertile plains in the northern part of the Niger\r\nValley, and in 1800 they conquered Timbuctoo; but soon they had to yield\r\nto another tribe of pastoral nomads, the Fulbes from the Senegal, who in\r\n1813 established a short-lived but well organized empire on the ruins of\r\nthe Tuareg dominion.[1081] [See map page 105.] The other agricultural\r\nstates of the Sudan have had the same experience. The Tibbus, predatory\r\nnomads of the French Sahara just north of Lake Chad and the River Yo,\r\nmounted on camels and ponies, cross the shrunken river in the dry season\r\nand raid Bornu for cattle, carry off women and children to sell as\r\nslaves, pillage the weekly markets on the Yo, and plunder caravans of\r\npilgrims moving eastward to Mecca.[1082] Nowhere can desert nomads and the\r\ncivilized peoples of agricultural plains dwell side by side in peace.\r\nRaids, encroachments, reprisals, finally conquest from one side or the\r\nother is the formula for their history. [See map page 487.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Forms of defense against nomad depredations.]\r\n\r\nThe raided territory, if a modern civilized state, organizes its border\r\ncommunities into a native mounted police, as the English have done in\r\nBornu, Sokoto and the Egyptian Sudan, and as the Russians did with their\r\nCossack riders along the successive frontiers of Muscovite advance into\r\nthe steppes; or it takes into its employ, as we have seen, the nearest\r\nnomad tribes to repress or punish every hostile movement beyond. Among\r\nthe ancient states the method was generally different. Since the nomad\r\ninvaders came with their flocks and herds, a barrier often sufficed to\r\nblock their progress. For this purpose Sesostris built the long wall of\r\n1500 stadia from Pelusium to Heliopolis as a barricade against the\r\nArabians.[1083] Ancient Carthage constructed a ditch to check the\r\ndepredations of the nomads of Numidia.[1084] The early kings of Assyria\r\nbuilt a barrier across the plains of the Euphrates above Babylon to\r\nsecure their dominion from the incursions of the desert Medes.[1085] In\r\nthe fifth century of our era, the \"Red Wall\" was constructed near the\r\nnorthern frontier of Persia as a bulwark against the Huns. It stretched\r\nfor a hundred and fifty miles from the Caspian Sea at the ancient port\r\nof Aboskun eastward to the mountains, and thus enclosed the populous\r\nvalley of the Gurgen River.[1086] In remote ages the neck of the Crimean\r\nPeninsula was fortified by a wall against the irruptions of the\r\nTauro-Scythians.[1087] The Russians early in their national history used\r\nthe same means of defense against Tartar incursions. One wall was built\r\nfrom Pensa on the Sura River to Simbirsk on the Volga, just south of\r\nKazan; another, further strengthened by a foss and palisades, extended\r\nfrom the fortress of Tsaritzin at the southern elbow of the Volga across\r\nthe fifty-mile interval to the Don, and was still defended in 1794 by\r\nthe Cossacks of the Don against the neighboring Kirghis hordes.[1088] The\r\nclassic example of such fortifications against pastoral nomads, however,\r\nis the Great Wall of China.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pastoral life as a training for soldiers.]\r\n\r\nThe nomad is economically a herdsman, politically a conqueror, and\r\nchronically a fighter. Strife over pasturage and wells meets us in the\r\ntypical history of Abraham, Lot and Isaac;[1089] it exists within and\r\nwithout the clan. The necessity of guarding the pastures, which are only\r\nintermittently occupied, involves a persistent military organization.\r\nThe nation is a quiescent army, the army a mobilized nation.[1090] It\r\ncarries with it a self-transporting commissariat in its flocks and\r\nherds. Constant practice in riding, scouting and the use of arms,\r\nphysical endurance tested by centuries of exertion and hardship, make\r\nevery nomad a soldier. Cavalry and camel corps add to the swiftness and\r\nvigor of their onslaught, make their military strategy that of sudden\r\nattack and swifter retreat, to be met only by wariness and extreme\r\nmobility. The ancient Scythians of the lower Danubian steppes were all\r\nhorse archers, like the Parthians. \"If the Scythians were united, there\r\nis no nation which could compare with them or would be capable of\r\nresisting them; I do not say in Europe, but even in Asia,\" said\r\nThucydides.[1091] In this opinion Herodotus concurred.[1092] The nomad's\r\nwhole existence breeds courage. The independent, hazardous life of the\r\ndesert makes the Arab the bravest of mankind, but the settled,\r\nagricultural Arab of Egypt and Mohammedan Spain lost most of his\r\nfighting qualities.[1093]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Military organization of nomads.]\r\n\r\nThe daily life of a nomad horde is a training school for military\r\norganization. In the evening the flocks and herds are distributed with\r\nsystem around the camp to prevent confusion. The difficult art of a well\r\nordered march, of making and breaking camp, and of foraging is practiced\r\nalmost daily in their constant migrations.[1094] The usual order of the\r\nBedouin march could scarcely be surpassed by an army. In advance of the\r\ncaravan moves a body of armed horsemen, five or seven kilometers ahead;\r\nthen follows the main body of the tribesmen mounted on horses and\r\ncamels, then the female camels, and after these the beasts of burden\r\nwith the women and children. The encampment of tents with the places\r\nfor men, arms and herds is also carefully regulated. More than this, the\r\nhorde is organized into companies with their superior and subordinate\r\nleaders.[1095] John de Carpini describes Genghis Khan's military\r\norganization of his vast Tartar horde by tens, hundreds and thousands,\r\nhis absolute dominion over his conquered subjects, and prompt absorption\r\nof them into his fighting force, by the compulsory enlistment of\r\nsoldiers out of every freshly subjugated nation.[1096] In the same way the\r\nHebrew tribes, when preparing for the conquest of Canaan, adopted from\r\nthe desert Midianites the organization of the horde into tens, hundreds\r\nand thousands under judges, who were also military leaders in time of\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Capacity for conquest and political consolidation.]\r\n\r\nThus certain geographic conditions produce directly the habitual and\r\nsystematic migration of the nomads, and through this indirectly that\r\nmilitary and political organization which has given the shepherd races\r\nof the earth their great historical mission of political consolidation.\r\nAgriculture, though underlying all permanent advance in civilization, is\r\nhandicapped by the lack of courage, mobility, enterprise and large\r\npolitical outlook characterizing early tillers of the soil. All these\r\nqualities the nomad possesses. Hence the union of these two elements,\r\nimperious pastor superimposed upon peaceful tiller, has made the only\r\nstable governments among savage and semi-civilized races.[1097] The\r\npolitically invertebrate peoples of dark Africa have secured the\r\nback-bone to erect states only from nomad conquerors. The history of the\r\nSudan cannot be understood apart from a knowledge of the Sahara and its\r\npeoples. All the Sudanese states were formed by invaders from the\r\nnorthern desert, Hamitic or Semitic. [See map page 487.] The Galla or\r\nWahuma herdsmen of East Africa founded and maintained the relatively\r\nstable states of Uganda, Kittara, Karague, and Uzinza in the equatorial\r\ndistrict; the conquerors remained herders while they lorded it over the\r\nagricultural aborigines.[1098] In prehistoric times when the various\r\npeoples of the Aryan linguistic family were spreading over Europe and\r\nsouthern Asia, the superiority of the shepherd races must have been\r\nespecially marked, because in that era only the unobstructed surface of\r\nthe steppes permitted the concentration of men on a vast scale for\r\nmigration and conquest. Everywhere else regions of broken relief and\r\ndense forests harbored small, isolated peoples, to whom both the idea\r\nand the technique of combined movement were foreign.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Scope of nomad conquests.]\r\n\r\nThe rapidity and wide scope of such conquests is explained largely by\r\nthe fact that nomads try to displace only the ruling classes in the\r\nsubjugated territory, leaving the mass of the population practically\r\nundisturbed. Thus they spread themselves thin over a wide area. How\r\nlasting are the results of such conquests depends upon the degree of\r\nsocial evolution attained by the herdsmen. Genghis Khan and Tamerlane,\r\nafter the manner of overlords, organized their conquered nations, but\r\nleft them under the control of local princes,[1099] while their tribute\r\ngatherers annually swept the country like typical nomad marauders. The\r\nTurks are still only encamped in Europe. They too make taxation\r\ndespoliation. And though their dominion has produced no assimilation\r\nbetween victor and vanquished, it has given political consolidation to a\r\nlarge area occupied by varied peoples. The Hyksos conquest of Egypt\r\nfound the Nile Valley divided into several petty principalities under a\r\nnominal king. The nomad conquerors possessed political capacity and gave\r\nto Egypt a strong, centralized government, which laid the basis for the\r\npower and glory of the Eighteenth Dynasty. The Tartars in 1279 A.D. and\r\nthe Manchus in 1664 conquered China, extended its boundaries, governed\r\nthe country as a ruling class, and left the established order of things\r\nundisturbed. The Saracen conquest of North Africa and Spain showed for a\r\ntime organization and a permanence due to the advanced cultural status\r\nof the sedentary Arabs drawn into the movement by religious enthusiasm.\r\nThe environment of Spain tended to conserve the knowledge of\r\nagriculture, industry, architecture, and science which they brought in\r\nand which might have cemented Spaniard and Moor, had it not been for the\r\nintense religious antagonism existing between the two races.\r\n\r\nThe history of nomad conquerors shows that they become weakened by the\r\nenervating climate and the effeminating luxury of the moist and fertile\r\nlowlands. They lose eventually their warlike spirit, like the Fellatah\r\nor Fulbe founders of the Sudanese states,[1100] and are either displaced\r\nfrom their insecure thrones by other conquerors sprung from the same\r\nnomad-breeding steppe, as the Aryan princes of India by the Mongol\r\nEmperor, and the Saracen invaders of Mesopotamia by the victorious\r\nTurkomans; or they are expelled in time by their conquered subjects, as\r\nthe Tartars were from Russia, the Moors from Spain, and the Turks from\r\nthe Danube Valley.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Centralization versus decentralization in nomadism.]\r\n\r\nNomad hordes unite for concerted action to resist encroachment upon\r\ntheir pastures, or for marauding expeditions, or for widespread\r\nconquest; but such unions are from their nature temporary, though a\r\ncareer of conquest may be sustained for decades. The geographically\r\ndetermined mobility which facilitates such concentration favors also\r\ndispersal, decentralization. This is the paradox in nomadism. Geographic\r\nconditions in arid lands necessitate sparse distribution of population\r\nand of herds. Pastoral life requires large spaces and small social\r\ngroups. When Abraham and Lot went to Canaan from Egypt, \"the land was\r\nnot able to bear them that they might dwell together, for their\r\nsubstance was great.\" Strife for the pasturage ensued between their\r\nrespective herdsmen, so the two sheiks separated, Lot taking the plains\r\nof Jordan and Abraham the hill pastures of Hebron. Jacob and Esau\r\nseparated for the same reason. The encampment of the Kirghis shepherds\r\nrarely averages over five or six tents, except on the best grazing\r\ngrounds at the best season of the year. The flow of spring, well or\r\nstream also helps to regulate their size. The groups of Mongol yurts or\r\nfelt tents along the piedmont margin of the Gobi vary from four tents to\r\na large encampment, according to water and grass.[1101] Prevalsky mentions\r\na population of 70 families or 300 souls in the Lob Nor district\r\ndistributed in 11 villages, or less than 28 in each group.[1102] Barth\r\nnoticed the smallness of all the oasis towns of the Sahara, even those\r\noccupying favorable locations for trade on the caravan routes.[1103]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Spirit of independence among nomads.]\r\n\r\nThe nature-made necessity of scattering in small groups to seek\r\npasturage induces in the nomad a spirit of independence. The Bedouin is\r\npersonally free. The power of the sheik is only nominal,[1104] and depends\r\nmuch upon his personal qualities. The gift of eloquence among the\r\nancient Arabs has been attributed to the necessity of persuading a\r\npeople to whom restraint was irksome.[1105] Political organization is\r\nconspicuously lacking among the Tibbus of the Sahara[1106] and the\r\nTurkoman tribes of the Trans-Caspian steppes. \"We are a people without a\r\nhead,\" they say. The title of sheik is an empty one. Custom and usage\r\nare their rulers.[1107] Though the temporary union of nomadic tribes forms\r\nan effective army, the union is short-lived. Groups form, dissolve and\r\nre-form, with little inner cohesion. The Boers in South African\r\ngrasslands showed the same development. The government of the Dutch East\r\nIndia Company in Cape Colony found it difficult to control the wandering\r\ncattlemen of the interior plateau. They loved independence and\r\nisolation; their dissociative instincts, bred by the lonely life of the\r\nthin-pastured veldt, were overcome only by the necessity of defense\r\nagainst the Bushmen. Then they organized themselves into commandos and\r\nsallied out on punitive expeditions, like the Cossack tribes of the Don\r\nagainst marauding Tartars. Scattered over wide tracts of pasture land,\r\nthey were exempt from the control of either Dutch or English authority;\r\nbut when an energetic administration pursued them into their widespread\r\nranches, they eluded control by trekking.[1108] Here was the independent\r\nspirit of the steppe, reinforced by the spirit of the frontier.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Resistance to conquest.]\r\n\r\nThough the desert and steppe have bred conquerors, they are the last\r\nparts of the earth's surface to yield to conquest from without. The\r\nuntameable spirit of freedom in the shepherd tribes finds an ally\r\nagainst aggression in the trackless sands, meager water and food supply\r\nof their wilderness. Pursuit of the retreating tribesmen is dangerous\r\nand often futile. They need only to burn off the pasture and fill up or\r\npollute the water-holes to cripple the transportation and commissariat\r\nof the invading army. This is the way the Damaras have fought the German\r\nsubjugation of Southwest Africa.[1109] Moreover, the paucity of economic\r\nand political possibilities in deserts and grasslands discourages\r\nconquest. Conquest pays only where it is a police measure to check\r\ndepredations on the bordering agricultural lands, or where such barren\r\nareas are transit lands to a desirable territory beyond. It is chiefly\r\nthe \"Gates of Herat\" and the lure of India which have drawn Russian\r\ndominion across the scorched plains of Turkestan. France has assumed the\r\nbig task of controlling the Sahara to secure a safe passway between\r\nFrench Tunisia and the rich Niger basin of the French Sudan. The recent\r\nBritish-Egyptian expansion southward across the Nubian steppes had for\r\nits objective the better watered districts of the upper Nile above\r\nKhartum. This desert advance is essentially a latter day phenomenon, the\r\noutcome of modern territorial standards; it is attended or secured by\r\nthe railroad. To this fact the projected Trans-Saharan line is the\r\nstrongest witness.\r\n\r\nNature everywhere postpones, obstructs, jeopardizes the political\r\nconquest of arid lands. The unstable, fanatical tribesmen of the\r\nEgyptian Sudan, temporarily but effectively united under the Mahdi, made\r\nit necessary for Kitchener to do again in 1898 the work of subjugation\r\nwhich Gordon had done thirty years before. The body of the Arabian\r\npeople is still free. The Turkish sovereignty over them to-day is\r\nnominal, rather an alliance with a people whom it is dangerous to\r\nprovoke and difficult to attack. Only the coast provinces of Hejaz,\r\nYemen and Hasa are subject to Turkey, while the tribes of the interior\r\nand of the southeastern seaboard are wholly independent.[1110] The\r\nTurkoman tribes of Trans-Caspia have been subordinated to Russia largely\r\nby a process of extermination.[1111] China is satisfied with a nominal\r\ndominion over the roaming populations of Mongolia and Chinese Turkestan.\r\nThe French pacification and control of Northwest Africa meets a peculiar\r\nproblem, due to the extreme restlessness and restiveness of the dominant\r\nArab race. The whole population is unstable as water; a disturbance or\r\nmovement in one tribe is soon communicated to the whole mass.[1112]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Curtailment of nomadism.]\r\n\r\nThe steppe or desert policy for the curtailment of nomadism, and the\r\nreclamation of both land and people is to encourage or enforce\r\nsedentary life. The French, to settle the wandering tribes on the Atlas\r\nborder of the Sahara, have opened a vast number of artesian wells\r\nthrough the agency of skillful engineers, and thus created oases in\r\nwhich the fecund sands support abundant date-palm groves.[1113] The method\r\npursued energetically by the Russians is to compress the tribes into\r\never narrowing limits of territory, taking away their area of plunder\r\nand then so restricting their pasture lands, that they are forced to the\r\ndrudgery of irrigation and tillage. In this way the Yomuts and Goklans\r\noccupying the Caspian border of Trans-Caspia have been compelled to\r\nabandon their old marauding, nomadic life and become to some extent\r\nagriculturists.[1114] The method of the Chinese is to push forward the\r\nfrontier of agricultural settlement into the grasslands, dislodging the\r\nshepherd tribes into poorer pastures. They have thus reclaimed for grain\r\nand poppy fields considerable parts of the Ordos country in the great\r\nnorthern bend of the Hoangho, which used to be a nursery for nomadic\r\ninvaders. A similar substitution of agriculture for pastoral nomadism of\r\nanother type has in recent decades taken place in the semi-arid plains\r\nof the American West. Sheep-grazing on open range was with difficulty\r\ndislodged from the San Joaquin Valley of California by expanding farms\r\nin the sixties. More recently \"dry farming\" and scientific agriculture\r\nadapted to semi-arid conditions have \"pushed the desert off the map\" in\r\nKansas, and advanced the frontier of tillage across the previous domain\r\nof natural pastures to the western border of the state.\r\n\r\nPastoral nomadism has been gradually dislodged from Europe, except in\r\nthe salt steppes of the Caspian depression, where a vast tract, 300,000\r\nsquare miles in area and wholly unfit for agriculture, still harbors a\r\nsparse population of Asiatic Kalmuck and Kirghis hordes, leading the\r\nlife of the Asiatic steppes.[1115] In Asia, too, the regions of pastoral\r\nnomadism have been curtailed, but in Africa they still maintain for the\r\nmost part the growing, expanding geographical forms which they once\r\nshowed in Europe, when nomadism prevailed as far as the Alps and the\r\nRhine. In Africa shepherd tribes cover not only the natural grasslands,\r\nbut lap over into many districts destined by nature for agriculture.\r\nHence it is safe to predict that a conspicuous part of the future\r\neconomic and cultural history of the Dark Continent will consist in the\r\nrelease of agricultural regions from nomad occupancy and dominion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Supplementary agriculture of pastoral nomads.]\r\n\r\nThough agriculture is regarded with contempt and aversion by pastoral\r\nnomads and is resorted to for a livelihood only when they lose their\r\nherds by a pest or robbery, or find their pasture lands seriously\r\ncurtailed, nevertheless nomadism yields such a precarious and monotonous\r\nsubsistence that it is not infrequently combined with a primitive,\r\nshifting tillage. The Kalmucks of the Russian steppes employ men to\r\nharvest hay for the winter feeding. The Nogai Tartars practice a little\r\nhaphazard tillage on the alluvial hem of the steppe streams.[1116] Certain\r\nArab tribes living east of the Atbara and Gash Rivers resort with their\r\nherds during the dry season to the fruitful region of Cassala, which is\r\ninundated by the drainage streams from Abyssinia, and there they\r\ncultivate dourra and other grains.[1117] The Bechuana tribes inhabiting\r\nthe rich, streamless grassland of the so-called Kalahari Desert rear\r\nsmall herds of goats and cultivate melons and pumpkins; among the other\r\nBechuana tribes on the eastern margin of the desert, the men hunt, herd\r\nthe cattle and milk the cows, while the women raise dourra, maize,\r\npumpkins, melons, cucumbers and beans.[1118] [Compare maps pages 105,\r\n487.]\r\n\r\nSuch supplementary agriculture usually shifts with the nomad group. But\r\nwhere high mountains border rainless tracts, their piedmont districts\r\nregularly develop permanent cultivation. Here periodic rains or melting\r\nsnows on the ranges fill the drainage streams, whose inundation often\r\nconverts their alluvial banks into ready-made fields. The reliability of\r\nthe water supply anchors here the winter villages of the nomads, which\r\nbecome centers of a limited agriculture, while the pasture lands beyond\r\nthe irrigated strips support his flocks and herds. Where the piedmont of\r\nthe Kuen Lun Mountains draws a zone of vegetation around the southern\r\nrim of the Takla Makan Desert, Mongol shepherds raise some wheat, maize\r\nand melons as an adjunct to their cattle and sheep; but their tillage is\r\noften rendered intermittent by the salinity of the irrigating\r\nstreams.[1119] Along the base of the Tian Shan Mountains, the felt yurt of\r\nthe Gobi nomad gives place to Turki houses with wheat and rice fields,\r\nand orchards of various fruits; so that the whole piedmont highway from\r\nHami to Yarkand presents an alternation of desert and oasis\r\nsettlement.[1120] Even the heart of arid Arabia shows fertile oases under\r\ncultivation where the lofty Nejd Plateau, with its rain-gathering peaks\r\nover five thousand feet high, varies its wide pastures with well tilled\r\nvalleys abounding in grain fields and date-palm groves.[1121] Along the\r\nwhole Saharan slope of the Atlas piedmont a series of parallel wadis\r\nand, farther out in the desert, a zone of artesian wells, sunk to the\r\nunderground bed of hidden drainage streams from the same range, form\r\noases which are the seat of permanent agriculture and more or less\r\nsettled populations. The Saharan highlands of Tibesti, whose mountains\r\nrise to 8,300 feet, condense a little rain and permit the Tibbus to\r\nraise some grain and dates in the narrow valleys.[1122]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Irrigation and horticulture.]\r\n\r\nThe few and limited spots where the desert or steppe affords water for\r\ncultivation require artificial irrigation, the importation of plants,\r\nand careful tillage, to make the limited area support even a small\r\nsocial group. Hence they could have been utilized by man only after he\r\nhad made considerable progress in civilization.[1123] Oasis agriculture is\r\npredominantly intensive. Gardens and orchards tend to prevail over field\r\ntillage. The restricted soil and water must be forced to yield their\r\nutmost. While on the rainy or northern slope of the Atlas in Algiers and\r\nTunis farms abound, on the Saharan piedmont are chiefly plantations of\r\nvegetables, orchards and palm groves.[1124] In Fezzan at the oasis of\r\nGhat, Barth found kitchen gardens of considerable extent, large palm\r\ngroves, but limited fields of grain, all raised by irrigation; and in\r\nthe flat hollow basin forming the oasis of Murzuk, he found also fig and\r\npeach trees, vegetables, besides fields of wheat and barley cultivated\r\nwith much labor.[1125] In northern Fezzan, where the mountains back of\r\nTripoli provide a supply of water, saffron and olive trees are the\r\nstaple articles of tillage. The slopes are terraced and irrigated, laid\r\nout in orchards of figs, pomegranates, almonds and grapes, while fields\r\nof wheat and barley border the lower courses of the wadis.[1126] In the\r\n\"cup oases\" or depressions of the Sahara, the village is always built on\r\nthe slope, because the alluvial soil in the basin is too precious to be\r\nused for house sites.[1127]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effect of diminishing water supply.]\r\n\r\nThe water supply in deserts and steppes, on which permanent agriculture\r\ndepends, is so scant that even a slight diminution causes the area of\r\ntillage to shrink. Here a fluctuation of snowfall or rainfall that in a\r\nmoist region would be negligible, has conspicuous or even tragic\r\nresults. English engineers who examined the utilization of the Afghan\r\nstreams for irrigation reported that the natives had exploited their\r\nwater supply to the last drop; that irrigation converted the Kabul River\r\nand the Heri-rud at certain seasons of the year into dry channels.[1128]\r\nIn the Turkoman steppes it has been observed that expanding tillage, by\r\nthe multiplication of irrigation canals, increased the loss of water by\r\nevaporation, and hence diminished the supply. Facts like these reveal\r\nthe narrow margin between food and famine, which makes the uncertain\r\nbasis of life for the steppe agriculturist. Even slight desiccation\r\ncontracts the volume and shortens the course of interior drainage\r\nstreams; therefore it narrows the piedmont zone of vegetation and the\r\nhem of tillage along the river banks. The previous frontier of field and\r\ngarden is marked by abandoned hamlets and sand-buried cities, like those\r\nwhich border the dry beds of the shrunken Khotan rivers of the Tarim\r\nbasin.[1129] The steppe regions in the New World as well as the Old show\r\ngreat numbers of these ruins. Barth found them in the northern Sahara,\r\ndating from Roman days.[1130] They occur in such numbers in the Syrian\r\nDesert, in the Sistan of Persia, in Baluchistan, the Gobi, Takla Makan\r\nDesert, Turfan and the Lop Nor basin, that they indicate a marked but\r\nirregular desiccation of central and western Asia during the historical\r\nperiod.[1131]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Scant diet of nomads.]\r\n\r\nIf a scant water supply places sedentary agriculture in arid lands upon\r\nan insecure basis, it makes the nomad's sources of subsistence even more\r\nprecarious. It keeps him persistently on low rations, while the drought\r\nthat burns his pastures and dries up well and wadi brings him face to\r\nface with famine. The daily food of the Bedouin is meal cooked in sour\r\ncamel's milk, to which bread and meat are added only when guests arrive.\r\nHis moderation in eating is so great that one meal of a European would\r\nsuffice for six Arabs.[1132] The daily food of the shepherd\r\nagriculturists on the Kuen Lun margin of the Takla Makan Desert is bread\r\nand milk; meat is indulged in only three or four times a month.[1133] The\r\nTartars, even in their days of widest conquest, showed the same habitual\r\nfrugality. \"Their victuals are all things that may be eaten, for we saw\r\nsome of them eat lice.\" The flesh of all animals dying a natural death\r\nis used as food; in summer it is sun-dried for winter use, because at\r\nthat time the Tartars live exclusively on mare's milk which is then\r\nabundant. A cup or two of milk in the morning suffices till evening,\r\nwhen each man has a little meat. One ram serves as a meal for fifty or a\r\nhundred men. Bones are gnawed till they are burnished, \"so that no whit\r\nof their food may come to naught.\" Genghis Khan enacted that neither\r\nblood nor entrails nor any other part of a beast which might be eaten\r\nshould be thrown away.[1134] Scarcity of food among the Tibetan and\r\nMongolian nomads is reflected in their habit of removing every particle\r\nof meat from the bone when eating.[1135] A thin decoction of hot tea,\r\nbutter and flour is their staple food. Many Turkoman nomads, despite\r\noutward appearance of wealth, eat only dried fish, and get bread only\r\nonce a month, while for the poor wheat is prohibited on account of its\r\ncost.[1136] The Saharan Tibbus, usually on a starvation diet, eat the\r\nskin and powdered bones of their dead animals.[1137]\r\n\r\nThe privations and hardships of life in the deserts and steppes\r\ndiscourage obesity. The Koko-Nor Mongols of the high Tibetan plateau are\r\nof slight build, never fat.[1138] The Bedouin's physical ideal of a man\r\nis spare, sinewy, energetic and vigorous, \"lean-sided and thin,\" as the\r\nArab poet expresses it.[1139] The nomadic tribesmen throughout the\r\nSahara, whether of Hamitic, Semitic or Negro race, show this type, and\r\nretain it even after several generations of settlement in the river\r\nvalleys of the Sudan. The Bushmen, who inhabit the Kalahari Desert, have\r\nthin wiry forms and are capable of great exertion and privations.[1140]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Checks to population.]\r\n\r\nThough the conquering propensities of nomadic tribes make large families\r\ndesirable, in order to increase the military strength of the horde, and\r\nthough shepherd folk acquiring new and rich pastures develop patriarchal\r\nfamilies, as did the Jews after the conquest of Canaan, nevertheless the\r\nlimited water and food supply of desert and grassland, as well as the\r\nrelatively low-grade economy of pastoral life, impose an iron-bound\r\nrestriction upon population, so that as a matter of fact patriarchal\r\nfamilies are rare. When natural increase finds no vent in emigration and\r\ndispersal, marriage among nomads becomes less fruitful.[1141] Artificial\r\nlimitation of population occurs frequently among desert-dwellers. In the\r\nLibyan oasis of Farafeah, the inhabitants never exceed eighty males, a\r\nlimit fixed by a certain Sheik Murzuk.[1142] Poverty of food supply\r\nexplains the small number of children in the typical Turkoman family.\r\nAmong the Koko-Nor Tibetans, monogamy is the rule, polygamy the\r\nexception and confined to the few rich, while families never include\r\nmore than two or three children.[1143] According to Burckhardt, three\r\nchildren constitute a large family among the Bedouins, much to the\r\nregret of the Bedouins themselves. Mohammedans though they are, few\r\npractice polygamy, while polyandry and female infanticide existed in\r\nheathen times.[1144] Desert peoples seem to be naturally monogamous.[1145]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Trade of nomads.]\r\n\r\nThe prevailing poverty, monotony and unreliability of subsistence in\r\ndesert and steppe, as well as the low industrial status, necessitate\r\ntrade with bordering agricultural lands. The Bedouins of Arabia buy\r\nflour, barley for horse feed, coffee and clothing, paying for them\r\nlargely with butter and male colts. The northern tribes resort every\r\nyear to the confines of Syria, when they are visited by pedlers from\r\nDamascus and Aleppo.[1146] The tribes from Hasa and the Nejd pasture land\r\nbring horses, cattle and sheep to the city of Koweit at the head of the\r\nPersian Gulf to barter for dates, clothing and firearms; and large\r\nencampments of them are always to be seen near this town.[1147] Arabia\r\nand the Desert of Kedar sold lambs, rams and goats to the markets of\r\nancient Tyre.[1148] The pastoral tribes of ancient Judea in times of\r\nscarcity went to Egypt for grain, which they purchased either with money\r\nor cattle. The picture of Jacob's sons returning from Egypt to Canaan\r\nwith their long lines of asses laden with sacks of corn is typical for\r\npastoral nomads; so is their ultimate settlement, owing to protracted\r\nfamine, in the delta land of Goshen. The Kirghis of the Russian and\r\nAsiatic steppes barter horses and sheep for cereals, fine articles of\r\nclothing, and coarse wooden utensils in the cities of Bukhara and the\r\nborder districts of Russia. Occasionally the land of the nomad yields\r\nother products than those of the flocks and herds, which enter therefore\r\ninto their trade. Such is the salt of the Sahara, secured at Taudeni and\r\nBilma, the gums of the Indus desert, and balm of Gilead from the dry\r\nplateau east of Jordan.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pastoral nomads as middlemen.]\r\n\r\nThe systematic migrations of nomads, their numerous beasts of burden,\r\nand the paucity of desert and steppe products determine pastoral tribes\r\nfor the office of middlemen;[1149] and as such they appear in all parts\r\nof the world. The contrast of products in arid regions and in the\r\nbordering agricultural land, as also in the districts on opposite sides\r\nof these vast barriers, stimulates exchanges. This contrast may rest on\r\na difference of geographic conditions, or of economic development, or\r\nboth. The reindeer Chukches of Arctic Siberia take Russian manufactured\r\nwares from the fur stations on the Lena River to trade at the coast\r\nmarkets on Bering Sea for Alaskan pelts. The sons of Jacob, pasturing\r\ntheir flocks on the Judean plateau, saw \"a company of Ishmaelites come\r\nfrom Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going\r\nto carry it down to Egypt.\"[1150] This caravan of Arabian merchants\r\npurchased Joseph as a slave, a characteristic commodity in desert\r\ncommerce from ancient times to the present. The predatory expeditions of\r\nnomads provide them with abundant captives, only few of which can be\r\nutilized as slaves in their pastoral economy. In the same way the\r\nKirghis manage the caravan trade between Russia and Bukhara, sometimes\r\nadding captured travelers to their other wares. In ancient times Nubian\r\nshepherd folk acted as migrant middlemen between Egypt and Meroe near\r\nthe junction of the Atbara River and the Nile, as did also the desert\r\ntribe of the Nasamones between Carthage and interior Africa.[1151] From\r\nremote ages an active caravan trade was carried on between the\r\nproductive districts of Arabia Felix and the cities of Mesopotamia,\r\nSyria and Egypt. Mohammed himself was a caravan leader; in the faith\r\nwhich he established religious pilgrimages and commercial ventures were\r\ninextricably united, while to the mercantile spirit it gave a fresh and\r\nvigorous impetus.[1152] The caravan trade of the Sahara was first\r\norganized by Moorish and Arab tribes who dwelt on the northern margin of\r\nthe desert, rearing herds of camels. These they hired to merchants for\r\nthe journey between Morocco and Timbuctoo, in return for cereals and\r\nclothing. Hence Morocco has been the chief customer of the great desert\r\ntown near the Niger, and sends thither numerous caravans from Tendouf\r\n(Taredant) Morocco, Fez and Tafilet. Algiers dominates the less\r\nimportant route via the oasis of Twat, and Tripolis that through\r\nGhadames to the busy towns in the Lake Chad basin.[1153]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Desert markets.]\r\n\r\nIf the camel is \"the ship of the desert,\" the market towns on the margin\r\nof the sandy wastes are the ports of the desert. Their bazaars hold\r\neverything that the nomad needs. Their suburbs are a shifting series of\r\nshepherd encampments or extensive caravanseries for merchant and pack\r\nanimal, like the _abaradion_ of Timbuctoo, which receives annually from\r\nfifty to sixty thousand camels.[1154] Their industries develop partly in\r\nresponse to the demand of the desert or trans-desert population. The\r\nfine blades of Damascus reflected the Bedouin's need of the best weapon.\r\nEach city has its sphere of desert influence. The province of Nejd in\r\nCentral Arabia is commercially subservient to Bagdad, Busrah, Koweit and\r\nBahrein.[1155] The bazaars of Samarkand and Tashkent exist largely for\r\nthe scattered nomads of Turkestan. Ancient Gaza[1156] and Askelon\r\nfattened on the Egyptian trade across the Desert of Shur, as Petra,\r\nBostra and Damascus on the thin but steady streams of nomad products\r\nflowing in from the Syrian Desert.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nomad industries.]\r\n\r\nThe abundant leisure of nomadic life encourages the beginning of\r\nindustry, but rarely advances it beyond the household stage, owing to\r\nthe thin, family-wise dispersion of population which precludes division\r\nof labor. Such industry as exists consists chiefly in working up the raw\r\nmaterials yielded by the herds. Among the Bedouins, blacksmiths and\r\nsaddlers are the only professional artisans; these are regarded with\r\ncontempt and are never of Bedouin stock.[1157] In the ancient world,\r\nindustry reached its zero point in Arabia, and in modern times shows\r\nmeager development there. On the other hand the Saharan Arabs developed\r\nan hereditary guild of expert well-makers, which seems to date back to\r\nremote times, and is held in universal honor.[1158]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Oriental rugs.]\r\n\r\nIt is to the tent-dwellers of the world, however, that we apparently owe\r\nthe oriental rug. This triumph of the weaver's art seems to have\r\noriginated among pastoral nomads, who developed it in working up the\r\nwool and hair of their sheep, goats and camels; but it early became\r\nlocalized as a specialized industry in the towns and villages of\r\nirrigated districts on the borders of the grazing lands, where the\r\nnomads had advanced to sedentary life. Therefore in the period of the\r\nCaliphate, from 632 to 1258, we find these brilliant flowers of the\r\nloom, blooming like the Persian gardens, in Persian Farsistan,\r\nKhusistan, Kirman and Khorasan. We find them spreading the mediæval fame\r\nof Shiraz, Tun, Meshed, Amul, Bukhara and Merv. The secret of this\r\npreeminence lay partly in the weaver's inherited aptitude and artistic\r\nsense for this textile work, derived from countless generations of\r\nshepherd ancestors; partly in their proximity to the finest raw\r\nmaterials, whose quality was equalled nowhere else, because it depended\r\nupon the character of the pasturage, probably also upon the climatic\r\nconditions affecting directly the flocks and herds.[1159]\r\n\r\nA map showing the geographical distribution of Eastern rug-making\r\nreveals the relation of the industry to semi-arid or saline pastures,\r\nand makes the mind revert at once to the blankets of artistic design and\r\ncolor, woven by the Navajo Indians of our own rainless Southwest. Rug\r\nweaving in the Old World reached its finest development in countries\r\nlike Persia, Turkestan, western Afghanistan, Baluchistan, western India\r\nand the plateau portions of Asia Minor, countries where the rainfall\r\nvaries from 10 to 20 inches or even less, [See map page 484.] where\r\nnomadism claims a considerable part of the population, and where the\r\nancestry of all traces back to some of the great shepherd races, like\r\nTurkomans and Tartars. These peoples are hereditary specialists in the\r\ncare, classification, and preparation of wools.[1160] Weavers of rugs\r\nform an industrial class in the cities of Persia and Asia Minor, where\r\nthey obey largely the taste of the outside world in regard to design and\r\ncolor;[1161] whereas the nomads, weaving for their own use, adhere\r\nstrictly to native colors and designs. Their patterns are tribal\r\nproperty, each differing from that of the other; and though less\r\nartistic than those of the urban workers, are nevertheless interesting\r\nand consistent, while the nomad's intuitive sense of color is fine.[1162]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Architecture of nomad conquerors.]\r\n\r\nThe principles of design and color which these tent-dwellers had\r\ndeveloped in their weaving, they applied, after their conquest of\r\nagricultural lands, to stone and produced the mosaic, to architecture\r\nand produced the Alhambra and the Taj Mahal.[1163] Whether Saracens of\r\nSpain or Turkoman conquerors of India, they were ornamentists whose\r\ncontribution to architecture was decoration. Working in marble, stone,\r\nmetals or wood, they wrought always in the spirit of color and textile\r\ndesign, rather than in the spirit of form. The walls of their mosques,\r\npalaces and tombs reproduce the beauty of the rugs once screening the\r\ndoors of their felt tents. The gift of color they passed on to the West,\r\nfirst through the Moors of Sicily and Spain, later through Venetian\r\ncommerce. Their influence can be seen in the exquisite mosaic decoration\r\nin the cloister of Mont Reale of once Saracenic Palermo, and in the\r\nDucal Palace and St. Mark's Cathedral of beauty-loving Venice.[1164] This\r\nhas been almost their sole contribution to the art of the world.\r\n\r\nPastoral nomads can give political union to civilized peoples; they can\r\nassimilate and spread ready-made elements of civilization, but to\r\noriginate or develop them they are powerless. Between the art,\r\nphilosophy and literature of China on the one side, and of the settled\r\ndistricts of Persia on the other, lies the cultural sterility of the\r\nCentral Asia plateau. Its outpouring hordes have only in part acquired\r\nthe civilization of the superior agricultural peoples whom they have\r\nconquered; from Kazan and Constantinople to Delhi, from Delhi to Peking\r\nthey have added almost nothing to the local culture.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Arid lands as areas of arrested development.]\r\n\r\nDeserts and steppes lay an arresting hand on progress. Their tribes do\r\nnot develop; neither do they grow old. They are the eternal children of\r\nthe world. Genuine nomadic peoples show no alteration in their manners,\r\ncustoms or mode of life from millennium to millennium. The interior of\r\nthe Arabian desert reveals the same social and economic status,[1165]\r\nwhether we take the descriptions of Moses or Mohammed or Burckhardt or\r\nmore recent travelers. The Bedouins of the Nubian steppes adhere\r\nstrictly to all their ancient customs, and reproduce to-day the pastoral\r\nnomadism of Abraham and Jacob.[1166] Genealogies were not more important\r\nto the biblical house of David and stem of Jesse than they are for the\r\nmodern Kirghis tribesman, who as a little child learns to recite the\r\nlist of his ancestors back to the seventh generation. The account which\r\nHerodotus gives of the nomads of the Russian steppes agrees in minute\r\ndetails with that of Strabo written five centuries later,[1167] with that\r\nof William de Rubruquis in 1253, and with modern descriptions of Kalmuck\r\nand Kirghis life. The Gauchos or Indian pastoral halfbreeds of the\r\nArgentine plains were found by Wappäus in 1870 to accord accurately with\r\nAvara's description of them at the end of the eighteenth century.[1168]\r\nThe restless tenants of the grasslands come and go, but their type never\r\nmaterially changes. Their culture is stationary amid persistent\r\nmovement. Only when here or there in some small and favored spot they\r\nare forced to make the transition to agriculture, or when they learn by\r\nlong and close association with sedentary nations the lesson of drudgery\r\nand progress, do the laws of social and economic development begin to\r\noperate in them. As a rule, they must first escape partly or wholly the\r\nenvironment of their pasture lands, either by emigration or by the\r\nintrusion into their midst of alien tillers of the soil.\r\n\r\nBut while the migrant shepherd originates nothing, he plays an\r\nhistorical rôle as a transmitter of civilization. Asiatic nomads have\r\nsparsely disseminated the culture of China, Persia, Egypt and Yemen over\r\nlarge areas of the world. The Semite shepherds of the Red Sea deserts,\r\nthrough their merchants and conquerors, long gave to the dark Sudan the\r\nonly light of civilization which it received, Mohammed, a Bedouin of the\r\nIshmaelite tribe, caravan leader on the desert highways between Mecca\r\nand Syria, borrowed from Jerusalem the simple tenets of a monotheistic\r\nreligion, and spread them through his militant followers over a large\r\npart of Africa and Asia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mental and moral qualities of nomads.]\r\n\r\nThe deserts and grasslands breed in their sons certain qualities and\r\ncharacteristics-courage, hardihood, the stiff-necked pride of the\r\nfreeman, vigilance, wariness, sense of locality,[1169] keen powers of\r\nobservation stimulated by the monotonous, featureless environment, and\r\nthe consequent capacity to grasp every detail.[1170] Though robbery\r\nabroad is honorable and marauder a term with which to crown a hero,\r\ntheft at home is summarily dealt with among most nomads. The property of\r\nthe unlocked tent and the far-ranging herd must be safeguarded.[1171] The\r\nTartars maintained a high standard of honesty among themselves and\r\npunished theft with death.[1172] Wide dispersal in small groups is\r\nreflected in the diversity of dialects among desert peoples;[1173] in the\r\npractice of hospitality, whether among Bedouins of the Nejd, Kirghis of\r\nthe Central Asia plateau,[1174] or semi-nomadic Boers of South\r\nAfrica;[1175] in the persistence of feuds and of the duty of blood\r\nrevenge, which is sanctioned by the Koran.\r\n\r\nIsolation tends to breed among nomads pride of race and a repugnance to\r\nintermixture. The ideal of the pastoral Israelites was a pure ethnic\r\nstock, protected by stern inhibition of intermarriage with other tribes.\r\nTherefore, Moses enjoined upon them the duty of exterminating the\r\npeoples of Canaan whom they dispossessed.[1176] While the urban Arabs\r\nshow a medley of breeds, dashed with a strain of negro blood, among the\r\nnomad Bedouins, mixture is exceptional and is regarded as a\r\ndisgrace.[1177] The same thing is true among the nomad Arabs of Algeria,\r\nand there it has placed a stumbling block in the way of the French\r\ncolonial administration, by preventing the appearance of half-breeds who\r\nmight bridge the gap between the colonials and natives. Where pastoral\r\nSemites have settled in agricultural lands, intermixture on a wide scale\r\nhas followed, as in the Sudan from Niger to Nile; but even here, when a\r\ntribe or clan has retained a strictly pastoral life in the grassland,\r\nand has held itself aloof from the agricultural districts of the Negro\r\nvillages, relatively pure survivals are to be found, as among the Cow\r\nor Bush Fulani of Bornu.[1178] On the other hand, the Hausa, a migrant\r\ntrading folk of mingled Arab and Negro blood, spread northward along the\r\ntrans-Saharan caravan route to the oasis of Air before the fourteenth\r\ncentury, and there have infused into the local Berber stock a strong\r\nNegro strain.[1179] Among the nomads of Central Asia, one wave of race\r\nmovement has so often followed and overtaken another, that it has\r\nproduced a confused blending of breeds. The mixtures are so numerous\r\nthat pure types are exceptional,[1180] and the exclusiveness of the\r\ndesert Semites disappears.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Religion of pastoral nomads.]\r\n\r\nThough all these desert-born characteristics and customs have a certain\r\ninterest for the sociologist, they possess only minor importance in\r\ncomparison with the religious spirit of pastoral nomads, which is always\r\nfraught with far-reaching historical results. The evidence of history\r\nshows us that there is such a thing as a desert-born genius for\r\nreligion. Huc and Gabin testify to the deeper religious feeling of the\r\nBuddhist nomads of the Central Asia plateaus, as compared with the\r\nlowland Chinese. The three great monotheistic religions of the world are\r\nclosely connected in their origin and development with the deserts of\r\nSyria and Arabia. The area of Mohammedism embraces the steppe zone of\r\nthe Old World[1181] from Senegambia and Zanzibar in Africa to the Indus,\r\nTarim and the upper Obi, together with some well watered lands on its\r\nmargins. It comprises in this territory a variety of races--Negroes,\r\nHamites, Semites, Iranians, Indo-Aryans, and a long list of Mongoloid\r\ntribes. Here is a psychological effect of environment. The dry, pure air\r\nstimulates the faculties of the desert-dweller, but the featureless,\r\nmonotonous surroundings furnish them with little to work upon. The mind,\r\nfinding scant material for sustained logical deduction, falls back upon\r\ncontemplation. Intellectual activity is therefore restricted, narrow,\r\nunproductive; while the imagination is unfettered but also unfed. First\r\nand last, these shepherd folk receive from the immense monotony of their\r\nenvironment the impression of unity.[1182] Therefore all of them, upon\r\noutgrowing their primitive fetish and nature worship, gravitate\r\ninevitably into monotheism. Their religion is in accord with their whole\r\nmental make-up; it is a growth, a natural efflorescence. Therefore it\r\nis strong. Its tenets form the warp of all their intellectual fabrics,\r\npermeate their meager science and philosophy, animate their more\r\nglorious poetry. It has moreover the fanaticism and intolerance\r\ncharacterizing men of few ideas and restricted outlook upon life.\r\nTherewith is bound up a spirit of propaganda. The victories of the Jews\r\nin Palestine, Syria and Philistia were the victories of Jehovah; the\r\nconquests of Saladin were the conquests of Allah; and the domain of the\r\nCaliphate was the dominion of Islam.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DISTRIBUTION OF RELIGIONS IN THE OLD WORLD (World map\r\nshowing distribution of Christians, Mohammedans, Brahmans, Buddhists,\r\nand Heathen).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fanaticism as a force in nomad expansion.]\r\n\r\nThe desert everywhere, sooner or later, drives out its brood, ejects its\r\npeople and their ideas, like those exploding seed-pods which at a touch\r\ncast their seed abroad. The religious fanaticism of the shepherd tribes\r\ngives that touch; herein lies its historical importance. Mohammedism,\r\nfierce and militant, conduced to those upheavals of migration and\r\nconquest which since the seventh century have so often transformed the\r\npolitical geography of the Old World. The vast empire of the Caliphate,\r\nfrom its starting point in Arabia, spread in eighty years from the Oxus\r\nRiver to the Atlantic Ocean.[1183] The rapid rise and spread between 1745\r\nand 1803 of the Wahaby clan and sect, the Puritans of Islam, which\r\nresulted for a time in their political and religious domination of much\r\nof Arabia from their home in the Nejd, recalls the stormy conquests of\r\nMohammed's followers. Islam is to-day a persistent source of ferment in\r\nAlgeria, the Sahara, and the Sudan, On the other hand. Buddhism serves\r\nto cement together the diverse nomadic tribes of the Central Asia\r\nplateaus, and keep them in spiritual subjection to the Grand Lama of\r\nLhassa. The Chinese government makes political use of this fact by\r\ndominating the Lama and employing him as a tool to secure quiet on its\r\nlong frontier of contact with its restless Mongol neighbors. Moreover\r\nthe religion of Buddha has restrained the warlike spirit of the nomads,\r\nand by its institution of celibacy has helped keep down population below\r\nthe boiling-point. [Compare maps pages 484 and 513.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The faith of the desert.]\r\n\r\nThe faith of the desert tends to be stern, simple and austere. The\r\nindulgence which Mohammed promised his followers in Paradise was only a\r\nreflex of the deprivation under which they habitually suffered in the\r\nscant pastures of Arabia. The lavish beauty of the Heavenly City\r\nepitomized the ideals and dreams of the desert-stamped Jew. The active,\r\nsimple, uncramped life of the grasslands seems essential to the\r\npreservation of the best virtues of the desert-bred. These disappear\r\nlargely in sedentary life. The Bedouin rots when he takes root. City\r\nlife contaminates, degrades him. His virile qualities and his religion\r\nboth lose their best when he leaves the desert. Contact with the cities\r\nof Philistia and the fertile plains of the Canaanites, with their\r\nsensual agricultural gods, demoralized the Israelites.[1184] The prophets\r\nwere always calling them back to the sterner code of morals and the\r\npurer faith of their days of wandering. Jeremiah in despair holds up to\r\nthem as a standard of life the national injunction of the pastoral\r\nRechabites, \"Neither shall ye build house nor sow corn nor plant\r\nvineyard, but all your days ye shall dwell in tents.\"[1185] The ascent in\r\ncivilization made havoc with Hebrew morals and religion, because ethics\r\nand religion are the finest and latest flower of each cultural stage.\r\nTransition shows the breaking down of one code before the establishment\r\nof another.\r\n\r\nJudaism has always suffered from its narrow local base. Even when\r\ntransplanted to various parts of the earth, it has remained a distinctly\r\ntribal religion. Intense conservatism in doctrine and ceremonial it\r\nstill bears as the heritage of its desert birth. Islam too shows the\r\nlimitations of its original environment. It embodies a powerful appeal\r\nto the peoples of arid lands, and among these it has spread and survives\r\nas an active principle. But it belongs to an arrested economic and\r\nsocial development, lacks the germs of moral evolution which\r\nChristianity, born in the old stronghold of Hebraic monotheism, but\r\nimpregnated by all the cosmopolitan influences of the Mediterranean\r\nbasin and the _Imperium Romanum_, amply possesses.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n[1026] Figures taken from Albrecht Penck, _Morphologie der\r\nErdoberfläche_, Vol. I, p. 151.

Man, as part of the mobile envelope of\r\nthe earth, like air and water feels always the pull of gravity. From\r\nthis he can never fully emancipate himself. By an output of energy he\r\nmay climb the steepest slope, but with every upward step the ascent\r\nbecomes more difficult, owing to the diminution of warmth and air and\r\nthe increasing tax upon the heart.[1186] Maintenance of life in high\r\naltitudes is always a struggle. The decrease of food resources from\r\nlower to higher levels makes the passage of a mountain system an ordeal\r\nfor every migrating people or marching army that has to live off the\r\ncountry which it traverses. Mountains therefore repel population by\r\ntheir inaccessibility and also by their harsh conditions of life, while\r\nthe lowlands attract it, both in migration and settlement. Historical\r\nmovement, when forced into the upheaved areas of the earth, avoids the\r\nridges and peaks, seeks the valleys and passes, where communication with\r\nthe lowlands is easiest.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Inaccessibility of mountains.]\r\n\r\nHigh massive mountain systems present the most effective barriers which\r\nman meets on the land surface of the earth. To the spread of population\r\nthey offer a resistance which long serves to exclude settlers. The\r\ndifficulty of making roads up steep, rocky slopes and through the\r\nforests usually covering their rain-drenched sides, is deterrent enough;\r\nbut in addition to this, general infertility, paucity of arable land,\r\nharsh climatic conditions, and the practical lack of communication with\r\nthe outside world offer scant basis for subsistence. Hence, as a rule,\r\nonly when pressure of population in the lowlands becomes too great under\r\nprevailing economic methods, do clearings and cabins begin to creep up\r\nthe slopes. Mountains are always regions of late occupation. Even in the\r\nStone Age, we find the long-headed race of Mediterranean stock, who\r\noriginally populated Europe, distributed over the continent close up to\r\nthe foot of the high Alps, but not in the mountains themselves, and only\r\nscantily represented in the Auvergne Plateau of France. The inhospitable\r\nhighlands of Switzerland, the German Alps, and the Auvergne received\r\ntheir first population later when the Alpine race began to occupy\r\nwestern Europe.[1187] The _Mittelgebirge_ of Germany were not settled till\r\nthe Middle Ages. In the United States, the flood of population had\r\nspread westward by 1840 to the ninety-fifth meridian and the north-south\r\ncourse of the Missouri River; but out of this sea of settlement the\r\nAdirondack Mountains, a few scattered spots in the Appalachians, and the\r\nOzark Highlands rose as so many islands of uninhabited wilderness, and\r\nthey remain to-day areas of sparser population. In 1800, the \"bare\r\nspots\" in the eastern mountains were more pronounced. [See map page\r\n156.] Great stretches of the Rocky Mountains, of the Laurentian\r\nHighlands of Canada, like smaller patches in the Scandinavian and Swiss\r\nAlps, are practically uninhabited.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mountains as transit regions.]\r\n\r\nMountain regions, like deserts and seas, become mere transit districts,\r\nwhich man traverses as quickly as possible. Hence they often lie as\r\ngreat inert areas in the midst of active historical lands, and first\r\nappear upon the historical stage in minor rôles, when they are wanted by\r\nthe plains people as a passway to desirable regions beyond. Then, as a\r\nrule, only their transit routes are secured, while the less accessible\r\nregions are ignored. Cæsar makes no mention of the Alps, except to state\r\nthat he has crossed them, until some of the mountain tribes try to block\r\nthe passage of Roman merchants or armies; then they become important\r\nenough to be conquered. It was not till after the Cimbri in 102 B.C.\r\ninvaded Italy by the Brenner route, that the Romans realized the value\r\nof Rhaetia (Tyrol) as a thoroughfare from Italy to Germany, and began\r\nits conquest in 36 B.C. This was the same value which the Tyrol so long\r\nhad for the old German Empire and later for Austria,--merely to secure\r\nconnection with the Po Valley. The need of land communication with the\r\nRhone Valley led the Romans to attack the Salyes, who inhabited the\r\nMaritime Alps, and after eighty years of war to force from them the\r\nconcession of a narrow transit strip, twelve stadia or one and a half\r\nmiles wide, for the purpose of making a road to Massilia.[1188] The\r\nnecessity of controlling such transit lands has drawn British India into\r\nthe occupation of mountain Baluchistan, Kashmir and Sikkim, just as it\r\nhas caused the highlands of Afghanistan to figure actively in the\r\nexpansion policy of both India and Russia. The conquest of such transit\r\nlands has always been attended by road building, from the construction\r\nof the Roman highway through the Brenner Pass to the modern Russian\r\nmilitary road through the Pass of Dariel across the Caucasus, and the\r\nyet more recent Indian railroad to Darjeeling, with the highway\r\nextension beyond to the Tibetan frontier through Himalayan Sikkim.\r\n\r\nSuch mountain regions attain independent historical importance when\r\ntheir population increases enough to form the nucleus of a state, and to\r\nacquire additional territory about the highland base either by conquest\r\nor voluntary union, while they utilize their naturally protected\r\nlocation and their power to grant safe transit to their allies, as means\r\nto secure their political autonomy. Therefore to mountain regions so\r\noften falls the rôle of buffer states. Such were medieval Burgundy and\r\nmodern Savoy, which occupied part of the same territory, Navarre which\r\nin the late Middle Ages controlled the important passway around the\r\nwestern end of the Pyrenees, and Switzerland which commands the passes\r\nof the central Alps. The position of such mountain states is, however,\r\nalways fraught with danger, owing to the weakness inherent in their\r\nsmall area and yet smaller allowance of productive soil, to their\r\ndiverse ethnic elements, and the forces working against political\r\nconsolidation in their deeply dissected surface. Political solidarity\r\nhas a hard, slow birth in the mountains.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Transition forms of relief between highlands and lowlands.]\r\n\r\nIn view of the barrier character of mountains, a fact of immense\r\nimportance to the distribution of man and his activities is the rarity\r\nof abrupt, ungraded forms of relief on the earth's surface. The\r\nphysiographic cause lies in the elasticity of the earth's crust and the\r\nleveling effect of weathering and denudation. Everywhere mountains are\r\nworn down and rounded off, while valleys broaden and fill up to shallow\r\ntrough outlines. Transition forms of relief abound. Human intercourse\r\nmeets therefore few absolute barriers on the land; but these few reveal\r\nthe obstacles to historical movement in perpendicular reliefs. The\r\nmile-high walls of the Grand Cañon of the Colorado are an insuperable\r\nobstacle to intercourse for a stretch of three hundred miles. The\r\nglacier-crowned ridge of the Bernese Alps is crossed by no wagon road\r\nbetween the Grimsel Pass and the upper Rhone highway around their\r\nwestern end, a distance of 100 kilometers (62 miles). The Pennine Alps\r\nhave no pass between the Great St. Bernard and the Simplon, a distance\r\nof 90 kilometers (54 miles).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Importance of transition slopes.]\r\n\r\nGentle transition slopes or terrace lands facilitate almost everywhere\r\naccess to the lowest, most habitable and therefore, from the human\r\nstandpoint, most important section of mountains. They combine the ease\r\nof intercourse characteristic of plains with many advantages of the\r\nmountains, and especially in warm climates they unite in a narrow zone\r\nboth tropical and temperate vegetation. The human value of these\r\ntransition slopes holds equally of single hills, massive mountain\r\nsystems, and continental reliefs. The earth as a whole owes much of its\r\nhabitability to these gently graded slopes. Continents and countries in\r\nwhich they are meagerly developed suffer from difficulty of intercourse,\r\nretarded development and poverty of the choicest habitable areas. This\r\nis one disadvantage of South Africa, emphasized farther by a poor\r\ncoastline. The Pacific face of Australia would gain vastly in historical\r\nimportance, if the drop from the highlands to the ocean were stretched\r\nout into a broad slope, like that which links our Atlantic coastal plain\r\nwith the Appalachian highlands. There each river valley shows three\r\ncharacteristic anthropo-geographical sub-divisions--the active seaports\r\nand tide-water tillage of its lower course, the contrasted agriculture\r\nof its hilly course, the upland farms, waterpower industries and mines\r\nof its headstream valleys, each landscape giving its population\r\ndistinctive characteristics. The same natural features, with the same\r\neffect upon human activities and population, appear in the long seaward\r\nslopes of France, Germany and northern Italy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Piedmont belts as boundary zones.]\r\n\r\nAt the base of the mountains themselves, where the bold relief begins,\r\nis always a piedmont zone of hilly surface but gentler grade, at whose\r\ninner or upland edge every phase of the historical movement receives a\r\nmarked check. Here is a typical geographical boundary, physical and\r\nhuman. It shifts slightly in different periods, according to the growing\r\ndensity of population in the plains below and improved technique in\r\nindustry and road-making. It is often both an ethnic and cultural\r\nboundary, because at the rim of the mountains the geologic and economic\r\ncharacter of the country changes.[1189] The expanding peoples of the plains\r\nspread over the piedmont so far as it offers familiar and comparatively\r\nfavorable geographic conditions, scatter their settlements along the\r\nbase of the mountains, and here fix their political frontier for a time,\r\nthough later they may advance it to the crest of the ridge, in order to\r\nsecure a more scientific boundary. The civilized population of the broad\r\nIndus Valley spread westward up the western highlands, only so far as\r\nthe shelving slopes of the clay and conglomerate foothills, which\r\nconstitute the piedmont of the Suleiman and Kirthar Mountains, afforded\r\nconditions for their crops. Thus from the Arabian Sea for 600 miles\r\nnorth to the Gomal River, the political frontier of India was defined by\r\nthe line of relief dividing the limestone mountains from the alluvial\r\nplain, the marauding Baluch and Afghan hill tribes from the patient\r\nfarmers of the Sind.[1190] This line remained the border of India from\r\npre-British days till the recent annexation of Baluchistan.\r\n\r\nThese piedmont boundaries are most clearly defined in point of race and\r\ncivilization, where superior peoples from the lowlands are found\r\nexpanding at the cost of retarded mountain folk. Romans and Rhaetians\r\nonce met along a line skirting the foot of the eastern Alps, as Russians\r\nto-day along the base of the Caucasus adjoin the territories of the\r\nheterogeneous tribes occupying that mountain area.[1191] [See map page\r\n225.] The plains-loving Magyars of Hungary have pushed up to the rim of\r\nmountainous Siebenburgen or Transylvania from Arad on the Maros River to\r\nSziget on the upper Theiss, while the highland region has a predominant\r\nRoumanian population. A clearly defined linguistic and cultural boundary\r\nof Indo-Aryan speech and religion, both Hindu and Mohammedan, follows\r\nthe piedmont edges of the Brahmaputra Valley, and separates the lowland\r\ninhabitants from the pagans of Tibeto-Burman speech occupying the\r\nHimalayan slope to the north and the Khasia Mountains to the south. The\r\nhighland race is Mongoloid, while the Bengali of an Aryan, Dravidian and\r\nMongoloid blend fill the river plain.[1192] Such piedmont boundary lines\r\ntend to blur into bands or zones of ethnic intermixture and cultural\r\nassimilation. The western Himalayan foothills show the blend of\r\nMongoloid and Aryan stocks, where the vigorous Rajputs of the plains\r\nhave encroached upon the mountaineer's land.[1193] Of almost every mountain\r\nfolk it can be assumed that they once occupied their highlands to the\r\noutermost rim of the piedmont, and retired to the inner rim of this\r\nintermediary slope only under compulsion from without.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Density of population in piedmont belts.]\r\n\r\nThe piedmont boundary also divides two areas of contrasted density of\r\npopulation. Mountain regions are, as a rule, more sparsely settled than\r\nplains. The piedmont is normally a transition region in this respect;\r\nbut where high mountains rise as climatic islands of adequate water\r\nsupply out of desert and steppes, they concentrate on their lower slopes\r\nall the sedentary population, making their piedmonts zones of greatest\r\ndensity. Low mountains in arid regions become centers of population;\r\nhere their barrier nature vanishes. In the Sudanese state of Darfur, the\r\nMarra Mountains are the district best watered and most thickly\r\npopulated. Nowhere higher than 6000 feet (1850 meters), they afford\r\nrunning water at 4000 feet elevation and water pools in the sandy beds\r\nof their wadis at 3200 feet. Below this, water disappears from the\r\nsurface, and can be found only in wells whose depth and scarcity\r\nincrease with distance from the central mountains.[1194] The neighboring\r\nkingdom of Wadai shows similar conditions and effects.[1195] In the heart\r\nof Australia, where utter desert reigns, the Macdonnell Ranges form the\r\nnucleus of the northern area occupied by the Arunta tribe of natives;\r\nfarther north the Murchison Range, usually abounding in water-holes, is\r\nthe center and stronghold of the Warramunga tribe.[1196]\r\n\r\nMineral wealth or waterpower in the mountains serves to collect an urban\r\nand industrial population along their rim, as we see it about the base\r\nof the Erz Mountains in Saxony, the Riesen range in Silesia, the\r\ncoal-bearing Pennine Mountains of northwestern England, and the\r\nhighlands of southern Wales, all which piedmont zones show a density of\r\nover 150 to the square kilometer (385 to the square mile). Hence the\r\noriginal Swiss Confederation, which included only the mountain cantons\r\nof Schwyz, Uri and Unterwalden, was greatly strengthened by the\r\naccession of the piedmont cantons of Lucerne, Zurich, Zug and Bern in\r\nthe early fourteenth century, as later by St. Gall, Aargau and Geneva.\r\nThese marginal cantons to-day show a density of population exceeding\r\n385 to the square mile, and rising to 1356 in the canton of Geneva.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Piedmont towns and roads.]\r\n\r\nPiedmont belts tend strongly towards urban development, even where rural\r\nsettlement is sparse. Sparsity of population and paucity of towns within\r\nthe mountains cause main of traffic to keep outside the highlands, but\r\nclose enough to their base to tap their trade at every valley outlet. On\r\nthe alluvial fans or plains of these valley outlets, where mountain and\r\npiedmont road intersect, towns grow up. Some of them develop into\r\ncities, when they command transverse routes of communication quite\r\nacross the highlands. The ancient _Via Aemilia_ traced the northern base\r\nof the Apennines from Ariminum on the Adriatic to Dertona at the foot of\r\nthe Ligurian range back of Genoa, and connected a long line of Roman\r\ncolonies. The modern railroad follows almost exactly the course of the\r\nold Roman road,[1197] while a transverse line southward across the\r\nApennines, following an ancient highway over the Poretta Pass to the\r\nArno Valley, has maintained the old preëminence of Bologna. A line of\r\ntowns, connected by highways or railroads, according to the economic\r\ndevelopment of the section, defines the bases of the Pyrenees, Alps,\r\nJura, Apennines, Harz, Vosges, Elburz and numerous other ranges. Along\r\nthe Elburz piedmont runs the imperial road of Persia from Tabriz through\r\nTeheran to Meshed. In arid regions these piedmont roads are an unfailing\r\nfeature, but their towns shrink to rural settlements, except at the\r\njunction of transmontane routes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Piedmont termini of transmontane routes.]\r\n\r\nPiedmont cities draw their support from plain, mountain and transmontane\r\nregion, relying chiefly on the fertile soil of the level country to feed\r\ntheir large populations. Sometimes they hug the foot of the mountains,\r\nas Bologna, Verona, Bergamo, Zurich, Denver and Pittsburg do; sometimes,\r\nlike Milan, Turin, and Munich, they drop down into the plain, but keep\r\nthe mountains in sight. They flourish in proportion to their local\r\nresources, in which mineral wealth is particularly important, and to the\r\nnumber and practicability of their transmontane connections. Hence they\r\noften receive their stamp from the mountains behind them as well as from\r\nthe bordering plain. The St. Gotthard route is flanked by Lucerne on the\r\nnorth and Milan on the south. The Brenner has its urban outlets at\r\nMunich and Verona. Narbonne and Barcelona form the termini of the route\r\nover the eastern Pyrenees; Toulouse commands the less used central\r\npasses, and Bayonne the western. Tiflis is situated in the great\r\nmountain trough connecting the Black Sea and the Caspian; but over the\r\nCaucasus by the Pass of Dariel come the influences which make it a\r\nRussian town. Peshawar, situated in the mountain angle of the Punjab,\r\ndepends more upon the Khaibar Pass and its connections thereby with\r\nCentral Asia than upon the plains of the Indus; its population, in\r\nappearance and composition nearly as much Central Asiatic as Indian, is\r\nengaged in traffic between the Punjab and the whole trans-Hindu Kush\r\ncountry.[1198]\r\n\r\nWhere a mountain system describes a semi-circular course, its transit\r\nroutes tend to converge on the inner side, and at their foci fix the\r\nsites of busy commercial centers. Turin draws on a long series of Alpine\r\nand Apennine routes from the Pass of Giovi (1548 feet or 472 meters)\r\nleading up from Genoa on the south, to the Great St. Bernard on the\r\nnorth. Milan gets immense support from the St. Gotthard and Simplon\r\nrailroads over the Alps, besides wagon routes over several minor passes.\r\nKulm, Balkh and Kunduz in the piedmont of northern Afghanistan are fed\r\nby twenty or more passes over the Hindu Kush and Pamir. Bukhara is the\r\nremoter focus of all these routes, and also of the valley highways of\r\nthe western Tian Shan. It therefore occupies a location which would make\r\nit one of the great emporiums of the world, were it not for the expanse\r\nof desert to the west and the scantiness of its local water supply,\r\nwhich is tapped farther upstream for the irrigation of Samarkand. In its\r\nbazaars are found drugs, dyes and teas from India; wool, skins and dried\r\nfruit from Afghanistan; woven goods, arms, and books from Persia; and\r\nRussian wares imported by rail and caravan. English goods, which\r\nformerly came in by the Kabul route from India, have been excluded since\r\nRussia established a protectorate over the province of Bukhara. Across\r\nthe highlands to the east, the cities of Kashgar and Yarkand, situated\r\nin that piedmont zone of vegetation where mountain and desert meet, are\r\nenclosed by a vast amphitheater formed by the Tian Shan, the Pamir\r\nHighlands, and the Karakorum range. Stieler's atlas marks no less than\r\nsix trade routes over the passes of these mountains from Kashgar to the\r\nheadstreams of the Sir-daria and Oxus, and six from Yarkand to the Oxus\r\nand Indus. Kashgar is a meeting ground of many nationalities. To its\r\nbazaars come traders from China, India, Afghanistan, Bukhara, and\r\nRussian Turkestan.[1199] The Russian railway up the Sir-daria to Andizhan\r\nbrings European goods within relatively easy reach of the Terek Davan\r\nPass, and makes serious competition for English wares entering by the\r\nmore difficult Karakorum Pass from India.[1200]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cities of coastal piedmonts.]\r\n\r\nWhere mountains drop off into a desert, as these Central Asiatic ranges\r\ndo, their piedmont cities are confined to a narrow zone between\r\nmountains and arid waste. Bordering two transit regions of scant\r\npopulation and through travel, they become natural outfitting points,\r\ncenters of exchange rather than production. Where mountains drop off\r\ninto the sea and the piedmont therefore becomes a coastal belt, again it\r\nborders two transit regions; but here the ports of the desert are\r\nreplaced by maritime ports, which command the world thoroughfare of the\r\nocean. They therefore tend to concentrate population and commerce\r\nwherever a good harbor coincides with the outlet of a transmontane\r\nroute, as in Genoa and Bombay.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Piedmonts as colonial or backwoods frontiers.]\r\n\r\nSince mountains are inhospitable to every phase of the historical\r\nmovement, they long remain regions of retardation. Hence to their\r\nbordering plains they sustain the relation of young undeveloped lands,\r\nso that life in their piedmont belts tends to show for a long time all\r\nthe characteristics of a new colonial frontier. The rim of the Southern\r\nAppalachians abundantly illustrates this principle even to-day. During\r\nthe westward expansion of the American people from 1830 to 1850, the\r\neastern rim of the Rocky Mountains was dotted with trading posts like\r\nthat of the Missouri Fur Company at the forks of the Missouri River,\r\nForts Laramie and Platte on the North Fork of the Platte, Vrain's Fort\r\nand Fort Lancaster on the South Fork, Bent's Fort at the mountain exit\r\nof the Arkansas River, and Barclay's in the high Mora Valley of the\r\nupper Canadian. These posts gathered in the rich pelts which formed the\r\none product of this highland area susceptible of bearing the cost of\r\ntransportation to the far away Missouri River. Though they developed\r\ninto way-stations on the overland trails, when the movement of\r\npopulation to California and Oregon in the forties and fifties made the\r\nRocky Mountains a typical highland transit region, yet they long\r\nremained frontier posts.[1201] Later the abundant water supply of this\r\npiedmont district, as compared with the arid plains below, and the\r\nmineral wealth of the mountains concentrated here an agricultural and\r\nindustrial population.\r\n\r\nIn Sze Chuan province of western China, the piedmont of a vast highland\r\nhinterland shows a similar development. Here the towns of Matang,\r\nSungpan, Kuan Hsien, and even the capital Chengtu, situated in the high\r\nMin Valley at the foot of the mountains walling them in on the west, are\r\nemporiums for trade with the Tibetans, who bring hither furs, hides and\r\nwool from their plateau pastures, and musk from the musk deer on the\r\nKoko Nor plains.[1202] Just to the north, Sian (Singan), capital of the\r\nhighland province of Shensi, concentrates the fur trade of a large\r\nmountain wilderness to the west. Several blocks on the main street form\r\na great fur market for the sale of mink and other skins used to line the\r\nofficial robes of mandarins.[1203]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mountain carriers.]\r\n\r\nLike seas, deserts, and other geographical transit regions, mountains\r\ntoo under primitive conditions develop their professional carriers.\r\nThese collect in the piedmont, where highway and mule train cease, and\r\nwhere the steep track admits only human beasts of burden, trained by\r\ntheir environment to be climbers and packers. These mountain carriers\r\nare found on the Pacific face of the coast ranges of North and South\r\nAmerica from the peninsula of Alaska to the Straits of Magellan. They\r\nare able to pack from 100 to 160 pounds up a steep grade. The Chilkoot\r\nIndians, men, women and children, did invaluable service on the White\r\nHorse and Chilkoot passes during the early days of the Klondike rush.\r\nThey had devised a well-arranged harness, which enabled them better to\r\ncarry their loads. Farther south in British Columbia the piedmont tribes\r\nhad once a like importance; there they operated especially from the town\r\nof Hope on the lower Frazer River as a distributing center. The Mexican\r\ncarrier is so efficient and so cheap that he enters into serious\r\ncompetition with modern schemes to improve transportation, especially as\r\nthe rugged relief of this country makes those schemes expensive.[1204] The\r\nIndians of the eastern slope of the Andes pack India rubber, in loads of\r\n150 pounds each, from the upper Purus and Madeira rivers up to the\r\nAndean plateau at a height of 15,000 feet, and there transfer their\r\nburdens to mules for transport down to the Peruvian port of\r\nMollendo.[1205]\r\n\r\nThe retarded mountain peoples on the borders of the Central Asia plateau\r\nemploy the same primitive means of transportation. The roads leading\r\nfrom the Sze Chuan province of western China over the mountain ranges to\r\nTibet are traversed by long lines of porters, men, women and children,\r\nladen with bales of brick tea,[1206] the strongest of them shouldering 350\r\npounds. The Bhutia coolies of Sikkim act as carriers on military and\r\ncommercial expeditions on the track across the Himalayas between\r\nDarjeeling and Shigatze. Colonel Younghusband found that these Bhutias,\r\nwho were paid by the job, would carry a pack of 250 to 300 pounds, or\r\nthree times the usual burden of a Central Asia carrier. Landon cites the\r\ncase of a Bhutia lady who was said to have carried a piano on her head\r\nfrom the plains up to Darjeeling (7150 feet).[1207] In Nepal, women and\r\ngirls, less often men, have long been accustomed to carry travellers and\r\nmerchandise over the Himalayan ranges.[1208] In the marginal valleys of\r\nthe Himalayas, like Kashmir and Baltistan, the natives are regularly\r\nimpressed for _begar_ or carrier service on the English military roads\r\nto strategic points on the high mountain frontier of the Indian\r\nEmpire.[1209] So the Igorots of the Luzon province of Benguet pack all\r\ngoods and supplies from Naguilian in the lowlands up 4000 feet in a\r\ndistance of 25 miles to their little capital of Baguio; for this service\r\nthey are now paid one peso (46 cents in 1901) a day with food, or ten\r\ntimes as much as under the Spanish rule.[1210]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Power of mountain barriers to block or deflect.]\r\n\r\nIf the historical movement slackens its pace at the piedmont slope,\r\nhigher up the mountain it comes to a halt. Only when human invention has\r\ngreatly improved communication across the barrier are its obstacles in\r\npart overcome. The great highland wall stretching across southern Europe\r\nfrom the Bay of Biscay to the Black Sea long cut off the solid mass of\r\nthe continent from the culture of the Mediterranean lands. Owing to\r\nthese mountains Central Europe came late into the foreground of history,\r\nnot till the Middle Ages. Even the penetrating civilization of Greece\r\nreached it only by long detours around the ends of the mountain barrier;\r\nby Massilia and the Rhone, by Istria and the Danube, Greek commerce\r\ntrickled through to the interior of the continent.\r\n\r\nWhere mountains fail to check, they deflect the historical movement. The\r\nwall of the Carpathians, bulwark of Central Europe, split the westward\r\nmoving Slav hordes in the 6th century, diverting one southward up the\r\nDanube Valley to the Eastern Alps, and turning one northward along the\r\nGerman lowlands.[1211] The northward expansion of the Romans, rebuffed by\r\nthe high double wall of the Central Alps, was bent to the westward over\r\nthe Maritime, Cottine and Savoy Alps, where the barrier offered the\r\nshortest and easiest transmontane routes. Hence Germany received the\r\nelements of Mediterranean culture indirectly through Gaul, second-hand\r\nand late. The ancient Helvetians, moving southward from northern\r\nSwitzerland into Gaul, took a route skirting the western base of the\r\nAlps by the gap at Geneva, and thus threatened Roman Provincia. Cæsar's\r\ncampaigns into northern Gaul were given direction by the massive Central\r\nPlateau of France.[1212] The rugged and infertile area of the Catskills\r\nlong retarded the westward movement in colonial New York and deflected\r\nit northward through the Mohawk depression, which therefore had its long\r\nthin line of settlements when the neighboring Catskills were still a\r\n\"bare spot.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Significance of mountain valleys.]\r\n\r\nIn their valleys, mountains lose something of their barrier nature, and\r\napproximate the level of the plains. Here they harbor oases of denser\r\npopulation and easier intercourse. Valleys favor human settlement\r\nthrough the milder climate of their lower elevation, the accumulation of\r\nsoil on their floors, their sheltered environment, and their command of\r\nsuch routes of communication as the highlands afford. They are the\r\navenues into and within a mountain system, and therefore radically\r\ninfluence its history by their direction and location. The Central\r\nPlateau of France, through the valleys of the Alliers and upper Loire,\r\nis most accessible from the north; therefore in that direction it has\r\nmaintained its most important historical connections,[1213] from the days\r\nof Cæsar and Vercingetorix. The massive highland region of Transylvania,\r\nwhich opens long accessible valleys westward toward the plains of the\r\nTheiss and Danube, has since the eleventh century received thence\r\nHungarian immigration and political dominion.[1214] Its dominant Roumanian\r\npopulation, however, seems to have fled thither from the Tartar-swept\r\nplains to the southeast.\r\n\r\nThe anthropo-geography of mountain valleys depends upon the structure of\r\nthe highlands themselves, whether they are fold mountains, whose ranges\r\nwall in longitudinal valleys, or dissected plateaus, whose valleys are\r\nmostly transverse river channels leading from the hydrographic center\r\nout to the rim of the highlands. Longitudinal valleys are not only long,\r\nbut also broad as a rule and often show a nearly level floor.[1215] They\r\ntherefore form districts of considerable size, fertility, and\r\nindividuality, and play distinct historical rôles in the history of\r\ntheir respective highlands. Such are the upper Rhone Valley with its\r\nlong line of flourishing towns and villages, the Hither Rhine, the Inn\r\nof the Tyrol and the Engadine, the fertile trough of the meandering\r\nIsère above Grenoble,[1216] the broad Orontes-Leontes valley between the\r\nLebanon and Anti-Lebanon where Kadesh and Baalbec were once the glory of\r\nnorthern Syria. Such is the central trough of the Appalachian Mountains,\r\nknown as the Great Appalachian Valley, seventy-five miles wide,\r\nsubdivided into constituent valleys of similar character by parallel,\r\neven-crested ridges following the trend of the mountains. These are\r\ndrained by broad, leisurely rivers, bordered by fertile farms and\r\nsubstantial towns. Transverse valleys, on the other hand, are generally\r\nnarrow, with steep slopes rising almost from the river's edge and\r\nsupporting only small villages and farms. A comparison of the spacious,\r\nsmooth-floored valley of Andermatt with the wild Reuss gorge, of the\r\nfertile and populous Shenandoah Valley in the Southern Appalachians with\r\nthe canon of the Kanawha in the Cumberland Plateau, makes the contrast\r\nstriking enough.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Longitudinal valleys.]\r\n\r\nLongitudinal valleys, by reason of their length and their branching\r\nlateral valleys, are the natural avenues of communication within the\r\nmountains themselves. They therefore give a dominant direction to such\r\nphases of the historical movement as succeed in passing the outer\r\nbarrier. The series of parallel ranges which strike off from the eastern\r\nend of the Tibetan plateau southward into Farther India have directed\r\nalong their valleys the main streams of Mongolian migration and\r\nexpansion, heading them toward the river basins of Burma and Indo China,\r\nand away from India itself.[1217] While Tibetan elements have during the\r\nages slowly welled over the high Himalayan brim and trickled down toward\r\nthe Gangetic plain, Burma has been deluged by floods of Mongolians\r\npouring down the runnels of the land. A carriage road follows the axis\r\nof the Central Alps from Lake Geneva to Lake Constance by means of the\r\nupper Rhone, Andermatt, and upper Rhine valleys, linked by the Furca and\r\nOberalp passes. The Roman and Medieval routes northward across the\r\nCentral Alps struck the upper Rhine Valley above Coire, (the ancient\r\nCuria Rhaetorum); this natural groove gave them a northeastward\r\ndirection, and made them emerge from the mountains directly south of\r\nUlm, which thereby gained great importance. The trade routes from\r\nDamascus and Palmyra which once entered the Orontes-Leontes trough in\r\nthe Lebanon system found their Mediterranean termini south near Tyre or\r\nnorth near Antioch, and thus contributed to the greatness of those\r\nancient emporiums. The Great Appalachian Valley used to be a highway for\r\nthe Iroquois Indians, when they took the warpath against the Cherokee\r\ntribes of Tennessee. Later it gave a distinct southwestward trend to\r\npioneer movements of population within the mountains, blending in its\r\ncommon channel the Quakers, Germans and Scotch-Irish from Pennsylvania,\r\nwith the English and Huguenot French of the more southern colonies. In\r\nthe Civil War its fertile fields were swept by marching armies, all the\r\nway from Chattanooga to Gettysburg.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Passes in mountain barriers.]\r\n\r\nThe barrier nature of mountains depends upon their height and structure,\r\nwhether they are massive, unbroken walls like the Scandinavian Alps and\r\nthe Great Smoky range; or, like the Welsh Highlands and the Blue Ridge,\r\nare studded with low passes. The Pyrenees, Caucasus and Andes, owing to\r\nthe scarcity and great height of their passes, have always been serious\r\nbarriers. The Pyrenees divide Spain from France more sharply than the\r\nAlps divide Italy from France; owing to their rampart character, they\r\nform the best and most definite natural boundary in Europe.[1218] Epirus\r\nand Aetolia, fenced in by the solid Pindus range, took little part in\r\nthe common life of ancient Greece; but the intermittent chains of\r\nThessaly offered a passway between Macedon and Hellas. The Alps have an\r\nastonishing number of excellent passes, evenly distributed for the most\r\npart. These, in conjunction with the great longitudinal valleys of the\r\nsystem, offer transit routes from side to side in any direction. The\r\nAppalachian system is some three hundred miles broad and thirteen\r\nhundred miles long, but it has many easy gaps among its parallel ranges,\r\nso that it offered natural though circuitous highways to the early\r\nwinners of the West. The long line (400 miles) of the Hindu Kush range,\r\nhigh as it is, forms no strong natural boundary to India, because it is\r\nriddled with passes at altitudes from 12,500 to 19,000 feet.[1219] The\r\neasternmost group of these passes lead down to Kashmir, and therefore\r\nlend this state peculiar importance as guardian of these northern\r\nentrances to India.[1220] The Suleiman Mountains along the Indo-Afghan\r\nfrontier are an imperfect defence for the same reason. They are indented\r\nby 289 passes capable of being traversed by camels. The mountain border\r\nof Baluchistan contains 75 more, the most important of which focus their\r\nroads upon Kandahar. Hence the importance to British India of Kandahar\r\nand Afghanistan. Across this broken northwest barrier have come almost\r\nall the floods of invasion and immigration that have contributed their\r\nvaried elements to the mixed population of India. Tradition, epic and\r\nhistory tell of Asiatic highlanders ever sweeping down into the warm\r\nvalley of the Indus through these passes; Scythians, Aryans, Greeks,\r\nAssyrians, Medes, Persians, Turks, Tartars, and Mongols have all\r\ntraveled these rocky roads, to rest in the enervating valleys of the\r\npeninsula.[1221]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Breadth of mountain barriers.]\r\n\r\nMountains folded into a succession of parallel ranges are greater\r\nobstructions than a single range like the Erz, Black Forest, and\r\nVosges, or a narrow, compact system like the Western Alps, which can\r\nbe crossed by a single pass. Owing to this simple structure the\r\nWestern Alps were traversed by four established routes in the days of\r\nthe Roman Empire. These were: I. The _Via Aurelia_ between the\r\nMaritime Alps and the sea, where now runs the Cornice Road. II. The\r\n_Mons Matrona_ (Mont Genevre Pass, 6080 feet or 1854 meters\r\n[Transcriber's Note: printer's error incorrectly printed as\r\nkilometers.]) between the headstream of the Dora Riparia and that of\r\nthe Durance, which was the best highway for armies. III. The Little\r\nSt. Bernard (7075 feet or 2157 meters), from Aosta on the Dora Baltea\r\nover to the Isère and down to Lugdunum (Lyons). IV. The Great St.\r\nBernard (8109 feet or 2472 meters) route, which led northward from\r\nAosta over the Pennine Alps to Octodurus at the elbow of the upper\r\nRhone, where Martigny now stands. Across the broad double rampart of\r\nthe Central Alps the Roman used chiefly the Brenner route, which by a\r\nlow saddle unites the deep reëntrant valleys of the Adige and Inn\r\nrivers, and thus surmounts the barrier by a single pass. However, a\r\nshort cut northward over the Chalk Alps by the Fern Pass made closer\r\nconnection with Augusta Vindelicorum (Augsburg). The Romans seem to\r\nhave been ignorant of the St. Gotthard, which, though high, is the\r\nsummit of an unbroken ascent from Lake Maggiore up the valley of the\r\nTicino on one side, and from Lake Lucerne up the Reuss on the other.\r\n\r\nMountains which spread out on a broad base in a series of parallel\r\nchains, and through which no long transverse valleys offer ready\r\ntransit, form serious barriers to every phase of intercourse. The lofty\r\nboundary wall of the Pyrenees, a folded mountain system of sharp ranges\r\nand difficult passes, has successfully separated Spain from continental\r\nEurope; it has given the Iberian Peninsula, in the course of a long\r\nhistory, closer relations with Morocco than with its land neighbor\r\nFrance. It thus justifies the French saying that \"Africa begins at the\r\nPyrenees.\" The Andalusian fold mountains stretching across southern\r\nSpain in a double wall from Trafalgar to Cape Nao, accessible only by\r\nnarrow and easily defended passes, enabled the Moors of Granada to hold\r\ntheir own for centuries against the Spaniard Christians. The high thin\r\nridges of the folded Jura system, poor in soil and sparsely populated,\r\nbroken by occasional \"cluses\" or narrow water-gaps admitting the rivers\r\nfrom one elevated longitudinal valley to another, have always been a\r\nserious hindrance to traffic.[1222]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Circuitous routes through folded mountains.]\r\n\r\nSuch mountains can be crossed only by circuitous routes from pass to\r\npass, ascending and descending each range of the system. The Central\r\nAlps, grooved by the longitudinal valleys of the upper Rhone, Rhine and\r\nInn, make transit travel a series of ups and downs. The northern range\r\nmust be crossed by some minor pass like the Gemmi, (7553 feet) or\r\nPanixer (7907 feet) to the longitudinal valleys, and the southern range\r\nagain by the Simplon (6595 feet), San Bernadino (6768 feet), Splügen\r\n(6946 feet) or Septimer (7582 feet) to the Po basin. Across the\r\ncorrugated highland of the Hindu Kush, lying between the plains of the\r\nIndus and the Oxus, the caravans of western Asia seek the market of the\r\nPunjab by a circuitous route through the Hajikhak Pass (12,188 feet) or\r\nfamous Gates of Bamian over the main range of the Hindu Kush, by the\r\nUnai Pass over the Paghman Mountains to Kabul at 5740 feet, and then by\r\ngorges of the Kabul River and the Khaibar Pass (6825 feet) down to\r\nPeshawar. This road presents so many difficulties that caravans from\r\nTurkestan to India prefer another route from Merv up the valley of the\r\nHeri-Rud through the western hills of the Hindu Kush to Herat, thence\r\ndiagonally southeast across Afghanistan to Kandahar, and thence by the\r\nBolan Pass down to the Sind. The broad, low series of forested mountains\r\nconsisting of the Vindhyan and Kaimur Hills, reinforced by the Satpura,\r\nKalabet, Gawilgarh ranges, Mahadeo Hills, Maikal Range and Chutia Nagpur\r\nPlateau as a secondary ridge to the south, forms a double barrier\r\nacross the base of peninsular India. It divides the Deccan from\r\nHindustan so effectually that it has sufficed to set limits to any Aryan\r\nadvance en masse southward. It kept southern India isolated, and\r\nadmitted only later Aryan influences which filtered through the barrier.\r\nTo people accustomed to treeless plains, these wide belts of wooded\r\nhills were barrier enough. Even a few years ago their passes were\r\ndreaded by cartmen; most of the carriage of the country was effected by\r\npack-bullocks. Even when roads were cleared through the forests, they\r\nwere likely to be rendered impassable by torrential rains.[1223]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dominant trans-montane routes.]\r\n\r\nWhere a broad, complex mountain system contracts to narrow compass, or\r\nis cut by deep reentrant valleys leading up to a single pass, the\r\ntransmontane route here made by nature assumes great historical\r\nImportance. The double chain of the mighty Caucasus, from 120 to 150\r\nmiles wide and 750 miles long, stretches an almost insuperable barrier\r\nbetween the Black Sea and the Caspian. But nearly midway between these\r\ntwo seas it is constricted to only 60 miles by a geographical and\r\ngeological gulf, which penetrates from the steppes of Russia almost to\r\nthe heart of the system.[1224] This gulf forms the high valley of the\r\nTerek River, beyond whose headstream lies the Dariel defile (7503 feet\r\nor 2379 meters), which continues the natural depression across to the\r\nshort southern slope. All the other passes of the Caucasus are 3000\r\nmeters or more high, lie above snow line and are therefore open only in\r\nsummer. The Dariel Pass alone is open all the year around.[1225] Here runs\r\nthe great military road from Vladicaucas to Tiflis, which the Russians\r\nhave built to control their turbulent mountaineer subjects; and here are\r\nlocated the Ossetes, the only people among the variegated tribes of the\r\nwhole Caucasus who occupy both slopes. All the other tribes and\r\nlanguages are confined to one side or the other.[1226] Moreover, the\r\nOssetes, occupying an exposed location in their highway habitat, lack\r\nthe courage of the other mountaineers, and yielded without resistance to\r\nthe Russians. In this respect they resemble the craven-spirited\r\nKashmiri, whose mountain-walled vale forms a passway from Central Asia\r\ndown to the Punjab.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Brenner route.]\r\n\r\nThe Pass of Dariel, owing to its situation in a retarded Brenner corner\r\nof Asia, has never attained the historical importance which attaches to\r\nthe deep saddle of the Brenner Pass (4470 feet) in the Central Alps.\r\nUniting the reëntrant valleys of the Inn and Adige rivers only 2760 feet\r\nabove the Inn's exit from the mountains upon the Bavarian plateau, it\r\nforms a low, continuous line of communication across the Central Alps.\r\nThe Brenner was the route of the Cimbri invading the Po Valley, and\r\nlater of the Roman forces destined for frontier posts of the Empire on\r\nthe upper Danube. In the Middle Ages it was the route for the armies of\r\nthe German Emperors who came to make good their claim to Italy. By this\r\nroad came the artists and artisans of the whole north country to learn\r\nthe arts and crafts of beauty-loving Venice. From the Roman road-makers\r\nto the modern railroad engineer, with the concomitant civilization of\r\neach, the Brenner has seen the march of human progress.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pass of Belfort.]\r\n\r\nFarther to the west, the wall of highlands stretching across southern\r\nEurope is interrupted by a deep groove formed by the mountain-flanked\r\nRhone Valley and the Pass of Belfort, or Burgundian Gate, which lies\r\nbetween the Vosges and Jura system, and connects the Rhone road with the\r\nlong rift valley of the middle Rhine. This pass, broad and low (350\r\nmeters or 1148 feet) marks the insignificant summit in the great\r\nhistoric route of travel between the Mediterranean and the North Sea,\r\nfrom the days of ancient Etruscan merchants to the present. This was the\r\nroute of the invading Teuton hordes which the Roman Marius defeated at\r\nAquae Sextiae, and later, of the Germans under Ariovistus, whom Cæsar\r\ndefeated near the present Mühlhausen. Four centuries afterward came the\r\nAlamannians, Burgundians and other Teutonic stocks, who infused a tall\r\nblond element into the population of the Rhone Valley.[1227] The Pass of\r\nBelfort is the strategic key to Central Europe. Here Napoleon repeatedly\r\nfixed his military base for the invasion of Austria, and hither was\r\ndirected one division of the German army in 1870 for the invasion of\r\nFrance. The gap is traversed to-day by a canal connecting the Doubs and\r\nthe Rhine and by a railroad, just as formerly by the tracks of migrating\r\nbarbarians.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mohawk route.]\r\n\r\nThe natural depression of the Mohawk Valley, only 445 feet (136 meters)\r\nabove sea level, is the only decided break across the entire width of\r\nthe long Appalachian system. This fact, together with its ready\r\naccessibility from the Hudson on the east and Lake Ontario on the west,\r\nlent it importance in the early history of the colonies, as well as in\r\nthe later history of New York. It was an easy line of communication with\r\nthe Great Lakes, and gave the colonists access to the fur trade of the\r\nNorthwest, then in the hands of the French. So when French and English\r\nfought for supremacy in the New World, the Mohawk and Hudson valleys\r\nwere their chief battleground; elsewhere the broad Appalachian barrier\r\nheld them apart. Again in the Revolution, control of the Mohawk-Hudson\r\nroute was the objective of the British armies mobilized on the Canadian\r\nfrontier, because it alone would enable them to co-operate with the\r\nBritish fleet blockading the coast cities of the colonies. In the War of\r\n1812, it was along this natural transmontane highway that supplies were\r\nforwarded to the remote frontier, to support Perry's fight for control\r\nof the Great Lakes. The war demonstrated the strategic necessity of a\r\nprotected, wholly American line of water communication between the\r\nHudson and our western frontier, while the commercial and political\r\nadvantage was obvious. Hence a decade after the conclusion of the war,\r\nthis depression was traced by the Erie Canal, through which passed long\r\nlines of boats to build up the commercial greatness of New York City.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Height in mountain barriers.]\r\n\r\nOther structural features being the same, mountains are barriers also in\r\nproportion to their height; for, with few exceptions, the various\r\nanthropo-geographic effects of upheaved areas are intensified with\r\nincrease of elevation. Old, worn-down mountains, like the Appalachians\r\nand the Ural, broad as they are, have been less effective obstacles than\r\nthe towering crests of the Alps and Caucasus. The form of the elevation\r\nalso counts. Easy slopes and flat or rounded summits make readier\r\ntransit regions than high, thin ridges with escarpment-like flanks.\r\nMountains of plateau form, though reaching a great altitude, may be\r\nrelatively hospitable to the historical movement and even have a regular\r\nnomadic population in summer. The central and western Tian Shan system\r\nis in reality a broad, high plateau, divided into a series of smoothly\r\nfloored basins and gently rolling ridges lying at an elevation of 10,000\r\nto 12,000 feet above the sea. Its pamirs or plains of thick grass,\r\nnourished by the relatively heavy precipitation of this high altitude,\r\nand forming in summer an island of verdure in the surrounding sea of\r\nsun-scorched waste, attract the pastoral nomads from all the bordering\r\nsteppes and deserts.[1228] Thus it is a meeting place for a seasonal\r\npopulation, sparse and evanescent, but its uplifted mass holds asunder\r\nthe few sedentary peoples fringing its piedmont. The corrugated dome of\r\nthe Pamir highland, whose valley floors lie at an elevation of 11,000 to\r\n13,000 feet, draws to its summer pastures Kirghis shepherds from north,\r\neast and west; and their flocks in turn attract the raids of the\r\nmarauding mountaineers occupying the Hunza Valley to the south. The\r\nPamir, high but accessible, was a passway in the tenth century for\r\nChinese caravans bound from \"Serica\" or the \"Land of Silk\" to the Oxus\r\nRiver and the Caspian. Here Marco Polo and many travelers after him\r\nfound fodder for their pack animals and food for themselves, because\r\nthey could always purchase meat from the visiting shepherds. The\r\npossibilities of the Pamir as a transit region are apparent to Russia,\r\nwho in 1886 annexed most of it to the government of Bukhara.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Contrasted accessibility of opposite slopes.]\r\n\r\nMountains are seldom equally accessible from all sides. Rarely does the\r\ncrest of a system divide it symmetrically. This means a steep, difficult\r\napproach to the summit from one direction, and a longer, more gradual,\r\nand hence easier ascent from the other. It means also in general a wide\r\nzone of habitation and food supply on the gentler slope, a better\r\ncommissary and transport base whence to make the final ascent, whether\r\nin conquest, trade or ethnic growth. Mountain boundaries are therefore\r\nrarely by nature impartial. They do not umpire the great game of\r\nexpansion fairly. They lower the bars to the advancing people on one\r\nside, and hold them relentlessly in place to the other. To the favored\r\nslope they give the strategic advantage of a swift and sudden descent\r\nbeyond the summit down the opposite side. The political boundary of\r\nFrance along the watershed of the Vosges Mountains is backed by a long,\r\ngradual ascent from the Seine lowland and faces a sharp drop to the rift\r\nvalley of the middle Rhine, Its boundary along the crest of the Alps\r\nfrom Mont Blanc to the Mediterranean brings over two-thirds of the\r\nupheaved area within the domain of France, and gives to that country\r\ngreat advantages of approach to the Alpine passes at the expense of\r\nItaly. With the exception of the ill-matched conflict between the\r\ncivilized Romans and the barbarian Gauls, it is a matter of history that\r\nfrom the days of Hannibal to Napoleon III, the campaigns over the Alps\r\nfrom the north have succeeded, while those from the steep-rimmed Po\r\nValley have miscarried. The Brenner route favored alike the Cimbri\r\nhordes in 102 B.C. and later the medieval German Emperors invading Italy\r\nfrom the upper Danube. The drop from the Brenner Pass to Munich is 2800\r\nfeet; to Rovereto, an equally distant point on the Italian side, the\r\nroad descends 3770 feet.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its ethnic effects.]\r\n\r\nThe inequality of slope has ethnic as well as political effects,\r\nespecially where a latitudinal direction also makes a sharp contrast of\r\nclimate on the two sides of the mountain system. Except in the Roman\r\nperiod, the southern face of the Alps has been an enclosing wall to the\r\nItalians. The southern cultivator penetrated its high but sunny valleys\r\nonly when forced by poverty, while the harsh climate on the long\r\nnorthern slope effectively repelled him. On the other hand, Switzerland\r\nhas overstepped the Alpine crest in the province of Ticino and thrust\r\nits political boundary in a long wedge down to the lowland of the Po\r\nnear Como; and the Alpine race, spilling everywhere over the mountain\r\nrim into the inviting Po basin, has given to this lowland population a\r\nrelatively broad skull, blond coloring and tall figure, sharply\r\ncontrasted with the pure Mediterranean race beyond the crest of the\r\nApennines.[1229]\r\n\r\nThe long northward slope of the Alps in Switzerland and Tyrol, and the\r\neasy western grade toward France, have enabled Germanic and Gallic\r\ninfluences of various kinds to permeate the mountains. A strong element\r\nof blond, long-headed Germans mingles in the population of the Aar and\r\nRhine valleys up to the ice-capped ridge of the Glarner and Bernese\r\nAlps,[1230] while the virile German speech has pushed yet farther south to\r\nthe insuperable barrier of the Monte Rosa group. The abrupt southward\r\nslope of the Himalayas has repelled ethnic expansion from the river\r\nlowlands of northern India, except in the mountain valleys of the Punjab\r\nstreams and Nepal, where the highland offered asylum to the Rajput race\r\nwhen dislodged by a later Aryan invasion, or when trying their energies\r\nin expansion and conquest.[1231] The Tibetan people, whose high plateaus\r\nrise almost flush with the Himalayan passes, have everywhere trickled\r\nthrough and given a Mongoloid mountain border to Aryan India,[1232] even\r\nthough their speech has succumbed to the pervasive Aryan language of the\r\npiedmont, and thus confused the real ethnic boundary. [See map page\r\n102.] The retarded and laborious approach of British \"influence\" up this\r\nsteep ascent to Lhassa, as opposed to the long established suzerainty of\r\nthe Chinese Emperor in Tibet, can be attributed in part to the\r\ncontrasted accessibility from north and south.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Persistence of barrier nature.]\r\n\r\nMountains influence the life of their inhabitants and their neighbors\r\nfundamentally and variously, but always reveal their barrier nature. For\r\nthe occupants of one slope they provide an abundant rainfall, hold up\r\nthe clouds, and rob them of their moisture; to the leeward side they\r\nadmit dry winds, and only from the melting snow or the precipitation on\r\ntheir summits do they yield a scanty supply of water. The Himalayas are\r\nflanked by the teeming population of India and the scattered nomadic\r\ntribes of Tibet. Mountains often draw equally clear cut lines of\r\ncleavage in temperature. The Scandinavian range concentrates upon Norway\r\nthe warm, soft air of the Atlantic westerlies, while just below the\r\nwatershed on the eastern side Sweden feels all the rigor of a sub-Arctic\r\nclimate. In history, too, mountains play the same part as barriers. They\r\nare always a challenge to the energies of man. Their beauty, the charm\r\nof the unknown beyond tempts the enterprising spirit; the hardships and\r\ndangers of their roads daunt or baffle the mediocre, but by the great\r\nones whose strength is able to dwarf these obstacles is found beyond a\r\nprize of victory. Such were Hannibal, Napoleon, Suvaroff, Genghis Khan,\r\nand those lesser heroes of the modern work-a-day world who toiled across\r\nthe Rockies and Sierras in the feverish days of '49, or who faced the\r\nsnows of Chilkoot Pass for the frozen gold-fields of the Yukon.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Importance of mountain passes.]\r\n\r\nFor migrating, warring and trading humanity therefore, the interest of\r\nthe mountains is centered in the passes. These are only dents or\r\ndepressions in the great up-lifted crest, or gaps carved out by streams,\r\nor deeper breaches in the mountain wall; but they point the easiest\r\npathway to the ultramontane country, and for this reason focus upon\r\nthemselves the travel that would cut across the grain of the earth's\r\nwrinkled crust. Their influence reaches far. The Brenner, by its\r\nmedieval trade, made the commercial greatness of Augsburg, Ratisbon,\r\nNuremberg, and Leipzig to the north, and promoted the growth of Venice\r\nto the south. The Khaibar Pass and the Gates of Herat in Afghanistan\r\nhave for long periods dominated the Asiatic policy of Russia and British\r\nIndia. The Mohawk depression and Cumberland Gap for decades gave\r\ndirection to the streams of population moving westward into the\r\nMississippi basin in the early history of the Republic. Where Truckee\r\nPass (7017 feet) makes a gash in the high ridge of the Sierra Nevada,\r\nthe California Trail in 1844 sought the line of least resistance across\r\nthe barrier mass, and deposited its desert-worn immigrants about the\r\nSacramento Valley and San Francisco Bay. There they made a nucleus of\r\nAmerican population in Mexican California, and in 1846 became the center\r\nof American revolt.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Persistent influence of passes.]\r\n\r\nThough modern engineering skill, especially when backed by a political\r\npolicy, may cause certain passes to gain in historical importance at the\r\ncost of others, the rule holds that passes are never quite\r\ninsignificant. Their influence is persistent through the ages. They are\r\nnature-made thoroughfares, traversed now by undisciplined hordes of\r\nmigrating barbarians, now by organized armies, now by the woolly flocks\r\nand guardian dogs of the nomad shepherd, now by the sumpter mule of the\r\nitinerant merchant, now by the wagon-trains of over-mountain settlers,\r\nnow by the steam engine panting up the steep grade. Nowhere does history\r\nrepeat itself so monotonously, yet so interestingly as in these mountain\r\ngates. In the Pass of Roncesvalles, notching the western Pyrenees\r\nbetween Pamplona in Spain and St. Etienne in France, fell the army of\r\nCharlemagne surprised and beset by the mountain tribes in 778;[1233]\r\nthrough this breach the Black Prince in 1367 led his troops to the\r\nvictory of Navarette; in the Peninsular War a division of Wellington's\r\narmy in 1813 moved northward up this valley, driving the French before\r\nthem; and by this route Soult advanced southward across the frontier for\r\nthe relief of the French forces shut up in Pamplona. The history of\r\nPalestine may be read in epitome in the annals of the Vale of Jezreel,\r\nwhere the highlands of Palestine sink to a natural trough before rising\r\nagain to the hill country of Galilee and the mountain range of high\r\nLebanon. This was the avenue for war and trade between the Nile and\r\nEuphrates, between Africa and Asia. Here the Canaanites expanded\r\neastward from the coast, cutting off northern Israel in Galilee from\r\nSamaria and Judea. Here Gideon turned back the incursions of the\r\nMidianites or western Arabs. Here was the open road for Assyrians,\r\nEgyptians, for Greek armies under Antiochus, and Roman armies under\r\nPompey, Mark Antony, Vespasian and Titus. Hither came the Saracens from\r\nthe east in 634 A. D. to rout the Greek army, and later the Crusaders\r\nfrom the west, to secure with castle and fortress this key to the Holy\r\nLand. Finally, hither came Napoleon from Egypt in 1799 on his way to the\r\nEuphrates.[1234]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Geographic factors in the historical importance of passes.]\r\n\r\nThe historical importance of passes tends to increase with the depth of\r\nthe depression, since the lowest gap in a range relegates the others to\r\nonly occasional or local use; and with their rarity, in consequence of\r\nwhich intercourse between opposite slopes is concentrated upon one or\r\ntwo defiles. The low dips of the Central American Cordilleras to 262\r\nfeet (80 meters) at Panama, 151 feet (46 meters) in the Nicaraguan\r\nisthmus, and 689 feet (210 meters) at Tehuantepec, present a striking\r\ncontrast both orographically and historically to the South American\r\nAndes, where from the equator to the Uspallata or Bermejo Pass (12,562\r\nfeet or 3842 meters) back of Valparaiso, a stretch measuring 33 degrees\r\nof latitude, the passes all reach or exceed 10,000 feet or 3000 meters.\r\nThe southern or Pennine range of the Alps, stretching as a snow-wrapped\r\nbarrier from Mont Blanc 90 miles to the central Alpine dome of the St.\r\nGotthard, is notched only by the Great St. Bernard and Simplon passes,\r\nwhich have therefore figured conspicuously in war and trade, since very\r\nearly times. The Pass of Thermopylæ, as the only route southward along\r\nthe flank of the Pindus system, figures in every land invasion of Greece\r\nfrom Xerxes to the Greek war of independence. All movements back and\r\nforth across the Caucasus wall have been confined to the Pass of Dariel\r\nand the far lower Pass of Derbent, or _Pylæ Albaniæ_; of the ancients,\r\nwhich lies between the Caspian and the last low spurs of the mountains\r\nas they drop down to the sea. The latter, as the easier of the two\r\npasses, has had a longer and richer history. It alone enabled the\r\nancient Persians temporarily to force a wedge of conquest to the\r\nnorthern foot of the Caucasus, and it has been in all ages a highway for\r\npeoples entering Persia and Georgia from the north. It has so far been\r\nthe only practicable route for a railway from the Russian steppes to the\r\nsouthern base of the Caucasus. While Vladicaucas and Tiflis have direct\r\nconnection by the military highway over the Pass of Dariel, the railroad\r\nbetween these two points makes a detour of 300 miles to the east.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Intermarine mountains.]\r\n\r\nIntermarine mountains as a rule offer the easiest passways where they\r\nsink to meet the flanking seas. The Pyrenees are crossed by only two\r\nrailroads, the Bayonne-Burgos line, along the shore of the Bay of\r\nBiscay, and the Narbonne-Barcelona line, overlooking the Mediterranean.\r\nBetween these extremities the passes are very high and only two are\r\npracticable for carriages, the Col de la Perche (5280 feet or 1610\r\nmeters) between the valleys of the Tet and the upper Segre, and the Port\r\nde Canfranc (7502 feet or 2288 meters) on the old Roman road from\r\nSaragossa to Oloron. The coastal road around the eastern end of the\r\nCheviot Hills has been the great intermediary between England and\r\nScotland. It was the avenue for early Teutonic expansion into the Scotch\r\nLowlands, the thoroughfare for all those armies which for centuries made\r\nBerwick a chronic battleground.\r\n\r\nFor purposes of trade these intermarine mountains are less serious\r\nbarriers, because they can be avoided by an easier and cheaper sea\r\nroute. Hence on each side of such ranges grow up active ports, like\r\nNarbonne and Barcelona, Bayonne and Bilbao with San Sebastian, on the\r\npiedmont seaboard of the Pyrenees; Petrovsk and Baku on the Caspian rim\r\nof the Caucasus, balancing the Crimean ports and Poti with Trebizond on\r\nthe Black Sea. Analogous is the position of Genoa and Marseilles in\r\nrelation to the Maritime Alps. Such ports are inevitably the object of\r\nattack in time of hostilities. In the Peninsular War almost the first\r\nact of the French was to seize Barcelona, San Sebastian and Bilbao; and\r\nthroughout the seven years of the conflict these points were centers of\r\nbattle, blockade and siege. If Russia ever tries to wrench the upper\r\nEuphrates Valley from Turkey, Trebizond will repeat the history of\r\nBarcelona in the Peninsular War.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pass roads between regions of contrasted production]\r\n\r\nAs the world's roads are used primarily for commerce, pass routes rank\r\nin importance according to the amount of trade which they forward; and\r\nthis in turn is decided by the contrast in the lands which they unite.\r\nThe passes of the Alps and the Pass of Belfort have been busy\r\nthoroughfares from the early Middle Ages, because they facilitate\r\nexchanges between the tropical Mediterranean and the temperate regions\r\nof Central Europe. Or the contrast may be one of economic and social\r\ndevelopment. The Mohawk depression forwards the grain of the\r\nagricultural Northwest in return for the manufactured wares of the\r\nAtlantic seaboard. The passes of the Asiatic ranges connect the\r\nindustrial and agricultural lowlands of India and China with the\r\nhighland pastures of Mongolia, Tibet, Afghanistan and Russian Turkestan.\r\nHence they forward the wool, skins, felts, cloth and carpets of the\r\nwandering shepherds in exchange for the food stuffs and industrial\r\nproducts of the fertile, crowded lowlands. Where passes open a highway\r\nfor inland countries to the sea, their sphere of influence is greatly\r\nincreased. San Francisco, New York, Marseilles, Genoa, Venice, Beirut\r\nand Bombay are seaports which owe their importance in no small degree to\r\ndominant pass routes into their hinterland.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Passes determine trans-montane roads.]\r\n\r\nIn plains and lowlands highways may run in any direction expediency\r\nsuggests, but in mountain regions the pass points the road. In very high\r\nranges there is no appeal from this law; but in lower systems and\r\nespecially in old mountains which have been rounded and worn down by\r\nages of denudation, economic and social considerations occasionally\r\ntranscend orographical conditions in fixing the path of highways.\r\nScarcely less important than pass or gap is the avenue of approach to\r\nthe same. This is furnished by lateral or transverse valleys of erosion.\r\nThe deeper their reentrant angles cut back into the heart of the\r\nhighlands, the more they facilitate intercourse and lend historical\r\nimportance to the pass route. The Alpine passes which are approached by\r\na single valley from each side are those crossed by railroads\r\nto-day,--Mont Cenis, Simplon, St. Gotthard and the Brenner. The Alpine\r\nchain is trenched on its inner or southern side by a series of\r\ntransverse erosion valleys, such as the Dora Baltea, Sesia, Tosa,\r\nTicino, Adda, Adige, and Tagliamento, which carry roads up to the chief\r\nAlpine passes. The coincidence of the Roman and medieval roads over the\r\nAlps with the modern railroads is striking, except in the single point\r\nof elevation. Railroads tend to follow lower levels. Modern engineering\r\nskill enables them to tunnel the crest, to cut galleries in the\r\nperpendicular walls of gorges, and to embank mountain torrents against\r\nthe spring inundation of the roadbed, where it drops to the valley\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Navigable river approaches to passes.]\r\n\r\nWhere gaps are low and the approaching waters are navigable, at least\r\nfor the small craft of early days, they combine to enhance the\r\nhistorical importance of their routes. The Mohawk River, navigable for\r\nthe canoe of Indian and fur trader, greatly increased travel and traffic\r\nthrough the Mohawk depression. The Pass of Belfort is the greatest\r\nhistoric gateway of western Europe, chiefly because it unites the\r\nchannels of the Rhone, Saône and Rhine. Lake Lucerne brings the modern\r\ntourist by boat to the foot of the railroad ascent to the St. Gotthard\r\nPass, as the long gorge of Lake Maggiore receives him at the southern\r\nend. Lake Maggiore is the water outlet also of the Simplon Pass from the\r\nupper Rhone, the Lukmanier (6288 feet or 1917 meters) from the Hither\r\nRhine, and the San Bernadino (6766 feet or 2063 meters) from the Hinter\r\nRhine.[1235] This geographical fact explains the motive of Swiss expansion\r\nin the fifteenth century in embracing the Italian province of Ticino and\r\nthe upper end of Lake Maggiore. A significance like that of the Swiss\r\nand Italian lakes for the Alpine passes appears emphasized in the Sogne\r\nFiord of Norway. This carries a marine highway a hundred miles into the\r\nland; from its head, roads ascend to the only two dents in the mountain\r\nwall south of the wide snowfield of the Jotun Fjeld, and they lead\r\nthence by the valleys of Hallingdal and Valders down to the plains of\r\nChristiania.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Types of settlements in the valley approaches.]\r\n\r\nGenuine mountain passes have only emergency inhabitants--the monks and\r\ndogs of the hospice, the road-keepers in their refuge huts or\r\n_cantonière_, or the garrison of a fort guarding these important\r\nthoroughfares. The flanking valleys of approach draw to themselves the\r\nhuman life of the mountains. Their upper settlements show a certain\r\ncommon physiognomy, born of their relation to the barren transit region\r\nabove, except in those few mountain districts of advanced civilization\r\nwhere railroads have introduced through traffic over the barrier. At the\r\nfoot of the final ascent to the pass, where often the carriage road ends\r\nand where mule-path or foot-trail begins, is located a settlement that\r\nlives largely by the transmontane travel. It is a place of inns,\r\nhostelries, of blacksmith shops, where in the busy season the sound of\r\nhammer and anvil is heard all night; of stables and corrals crowded with\r\npack and draft animals; of storehouses where the traveler can provide\r\nhimself with food for the journey across the barren, uninhabited\r\nheights. It is the typical outfitting point such as springs up on the\r\nmargin of any pure transit region, whether mountain or desert. Such\r\nplaces are Andermatt and Airolo, lying at an altitude of 4000 feet or\r\nmore on the St. Gotthard road, St. Moritz below the Maloja Pass, Jaca\r\nnear the Pass de Canfranc over the Pyrenees, Kugiar and Shahidula[1236] at\r\nan elevation of 10,775 feet or 3285 meters on the road up to the\r\nKarakorum Pass (18,548 feet or 5655 meters), which crosses the highest\r\nrange of the Himalayas between Leh in the upper Indus Valley and\r\nYarkand in Chinese Turkestan.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lower settlements.]\r\n\r\nFarther down the transverse valley the type of settlement changes where\r\nside valleys, leading down from other passes, converge and help build up\r\na distributing center for a considerable highland area. Such a point is\r\nChiavenna in northern Italy, located above the head of Lake Como at the\r\njunction of the Mera and Liro valleys, which lead respectively to the\r\nSplügen and Maloja passes. It lies at an altitude of 1090 feet (332\r\nmeters) and has a population of 4000. Such a point is Aosta (1913 feet\r\nor 583 meters elevation) in the Dora Baltea Valley, commanding the\r\nItalian approaches to the Great St. Bernard Pass, and the less important\r\nCol de Fenêtre leading to the upper Rhone, the Little St. Bernard\r\nhighway to the valley of the Isère, and Col de la Seigne path around the\r\nMont Blanc range to the valley of the Arve. Aosta was an important place\r\nin the Roman period and has to-day a population of about 8000. Kokan, in\r\nthe upper Sir-Daria Valley in Russian Turkestan, commands the approach\r\nto the passes of the western Tian Shan and the northern Pamir. Its\r\nwell-stocked bazaars, containing goods from Russia, Persia and India,\r\ntestify to its commercial location.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pass cities and their markets.]\r\n\r\nWhen the highland area is very broad and therefore necessitates long\r\ntransit journeys, genuine pass cities develop at high altitudes, and\r\nbecome the termini of the transmontane trade. Such is the Leh (11,280\r\nfeet or 3439 meters) on the caravan route from Central Asia over the\r\nKarakorum Pass down to Kashmir, and such is Srinagar (5252 feet or 1603\r\nmeters) in Kashmir. To their markets come caravans from Chinese\r\nTurkestan, laden with carpets and brick tea, and Tibetan merchants from\r\nLhassa, bringing wool from their highland pastures to exchange for the\r\nrice and sugar of lowland India.[1237] Leh is conveniently situated about\r\nhalf way between the markets of India and Central Asia. Therefore it is\r\nthe terminus for caravans arriving from both regions, and exchange place\r\nfor products from north and south. Seldom do caravans from either\r\ndirection go farther than this point. Here the merchants rest for a\r\nmonth or two and barter their goods. Tents of every kind, camels, yaks,\r\nmules and horses, coolie transports of various races, men of many\r\nlanguages and many religions, give to this high-laid town a truly\r\ncosmopolitan stamp in the summer time when the passes are open.[1238]\r\nKabul, which lies at an altitude of nearly 6000 feet near the head of\r\nthe Kabul River, is the focus of numerous routes over the Hindu Kush,\r\nand dominates all routes converging on the northwest frontier of the\r\nPunjab.[1239] It is therefore the military and commercial key to India.\r\nIts narrow winding streets are obstructed by the picturesque _kafilas_\r\nof Oriental merchants, stocked with both Russian goods from the Oxus\r\ndistricts and British goods from India in evidence of its intermediary\r\nlocation.[1240]\r\n\r\nOccasionally a very high market develops for purely local use. The\r\nIndian Himalayan province of Kumaon contains the market town of\r\nGarbyang, at an elevation of 10,300 feet or about 3000 meters, on the\r\nKali River road leading by the Lipu Lekh Pass (16,780 feet or 5115\r\nmeters) over to Tibet. It has grown up as a trade center for the Dokpa\r\nTibetans, who will not descend below 10,000 feet because their yak and\r\nsheep die at a lower altitude.[1241] Farther east in the Sikkim border,\r\nDarjeeling (7150 feet or 2180 meters elevation) is center of the British\r\nwool trade with Tibet.\r\n\r\nOften the exchange point moves nearer the summit of the pass, dividing\r\nthe journey more equally between the two areas of production. Here\r\ndevelops the temporary summer market. High up on the route between Leh\r\nand Yarkand is Sasar, a place of unroofed enclosures for the deposit of\r\ncotton, silk and other goods left there by the caravans plying back and\r\nforth between Leh and Sasar, or Sasar and Yarkand.[1242] Nearly midway on\r\nthe much frequented trade route between Leh and Lhassa, at a point\r\n15,100 feet (nearly 500 meters) above sea level, just below the Schako\r\nPass, lies Gartok in western Tibet, in summer a busy market surrounded\r\nby a city of tents, and the summer residence of the two Chinese\r\nviceroys, who occupy the only two substantial dwellings in the place.\r\nHere at the end of August is held a great annual fair, which is attended\r\nby traders from India, Kashmir, Mongolia, Chinese Turkestan, China\r\nproper, and Lhassa; but by November the place is deserted. The traders\r\ndisperse, and the few residents of Gartok, together with the viceroys,\r\nretire down the Indus Valley to the more sheltered village of Gargunza\r\n(14,140 feet or 4311 meters elevation), which represents the limits of\r\npermanent settlement in these altitudes.[1243] The Sutlej Valley route\r\nfrom the Punjab to Lhassa is capped near its summit at an altitude of\r\nabout 5000 meters by the summer market, of Gyanema, whose numerous types\r\nof tents indicate the various homes of the traders from Lhassa to\r\nIndia.[1244]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pass peoples.]\r\n\r\nNatural thoroughfares, whether river highways or mountain pass routes,\r\ndraw to themselves migration, travel, trade and war. They therefore\r\nearly assume historical importance. Hence we find that peoples\r\ncontrolling transmontane routes have always been able to exert an\r\nhistorical influence out of proportion to their size and strength; and\r\nthat in consequence they early become an object of conquest to the\r\npeople of the lowlands, as soon as these desire to control such transit\r\nroutes. The power of these pass tribes is often due to the trade which\r\nthey command and which compensates them for the unproductive character\r\nof their country. In the eastern Himalayas the Tomos of the Chumbi\r\nValley are intermediaries of trade between Darjeeling and Tibet, In the\r\nwestern Himalayas, the Kumaon borderland of northern India, which\r\ncommands some of the best passes, has made its native folk or Bhutias\r\nbold merchants who jealously monopolize the trade over the passes to the\r\nTibetan markets. They stretch for a zone of thirty miles south of the\r\nboundary from Nepal to Garhwal along the approach to every pass, each\r\nsub-group having its particular trade route.[1245]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Transit duties.]\r\n\r\nIt is always possible for such pass tribes to levy a toll or transit\r\nduty on merchandise, or in lieu of this to rob. Cæsar made war upon the\r\nVeragri and Seduni, who commanded the northern end of the Great St.\r\nBernard Pass, in order to open up the road over the Alps, which was\r\ntraversed by Roman merchants _magno cum periculo magnisque cum\r\nportoriis_.[1246] The Salassi, who inhabited the upper Dora Baltea Valley\r\nand hence controlled the Little St. Bernard wagon road leading over to\r\nLugdunum or Lyons, regularly plundered or taxed all who attempted to\r\ncross their mountains. On one occasion they levied a toll of a drachm\r\nper man on a Roman army, and on another plundered the treasure of Cæsar\r\nhimself. After a protracted struggle they were crushed by Augustus, who\r\nfounded Aosta and garrisoned it with a body of Praetorian cohorts to\r\npolice the highway.[1247] The Iapodes in the Julian Alps controlled the\r\nMount Ocra or Peartree Pass, which carried the Roman wagon road from\r\nAquileia over the mountains down to the valley of the Laibach and the\r\nSave. This strategic position they exploited to the utmost, till\r\nAugustus brought them to subjection as a preliminary to Roman expansion\r\non the Danube.[1248]\r\n\r\nTurning to another part of the world, we find that the Afghan tribes\r\ncommanding the passes of the Suleiman Mountains have long been\r\naccustomed to impose transit duties upon caravans plying between\r\nTurkestan and India. The merchants have regularly organized themselves\r\ninto bands of hundreds or even thousands to resist attack or exorbitant\r\nexactions. The Afghans have always enforced their right to collect tolls\r\nin the Khaibar and Kohat passes, and have thus blackmailed every Indian\r\ndynasty for centuries. In 1881 the British government came to terms with\r\nthem by paying them an annual sum to keep these roads open.[1249] Just to\r\nthe south the Gomal Pass, which carries the main traffic road over the\r\nborder mountains between the Punjab and the Afghan city of Ghazni, is\r\nheld by the brigand tribe of Waziris, and is a dangerous gauntlet to be\r\nrun by every armed caravan passing to and from India.[1250] The Ossetes of\r\nthe Caucasus, who occupy the Pass of Dariel and the approaching valleys,\r\nregularly preyed upon the traffic moving between Russia and Georgia,\r\ntill the Muscovite government seized and policed the road.[1251]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Strategic power of pass states.]\r\n\r\nThe strategic importance of pass peoples tends early to assume a\r\npolitical aspect. The mountain state learns to exploit this one\r\nadvantage of its ill-favored geographical location. The cradle of the\r\nold Savoyard power in the late Middle Ages lay in the Alpine lands\r\nbetween Lake Geneva and the western tributaries of the Po River. This\r\nlocation controlling several great mountain routes between France and\r\nItaly gave the Savoyard princes their first importance.[1252] The autonomy\r\nof Switzerland can be traced not less to the citadel character of the\r\ncountry and the native independence of its people, than to their\r\npolitical exploitation of their strategic position. They profited,\r\nmoreover, by the wish of their neighbors that such an important transit\r\nregion between semi-tropical and temperate Europe should be held by a\r\npower too weak to obstruct its routes. The Amir of Kabul, backed by the\r\nrapacious Afridi tribes of the Suleiman Mountains, has been able to play\r\noff British India against Russia, and thereby to secure from both powers\r\na degree of consideration not usually shown to inferior nations.\r\nSimilarly in colonial America, the Iroquois of the Mohawk depression,\r\nwho commanded the passway from the Hudson to the fur fields of the\r\nNorthwest and also the avenue of attack upon the New York settlements\r\nfor the French in Canada, were early conciliated by the English and used\r\nby them as allies, first in the French wars and afterward in the\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n[1186] For physical effects, see Angelo Mosso, Life of Man on the High\r\nAlps.

To every mountain\r\nregion both these pertain, resulting in a nice interplay of geographic\r\nfactors. Every mountain slope from summit to piedmont is, from the\r\nanthropo-geographical standpoint, a complex phenomenon. When high\r\nenough, it may show a graded series of contrasted complementary\r\nlocations, closely interdependent grouping of populations and\r\nemployments, every degree of density from congestion to vacancy, every\r\nrange of cultural development from industrialism to nomadism. The\r\nsouthern slope of the Monte Rosa Alps, from the glacier cap at 4500\r\nmeters to the banks of the Po River, yields within certain limits a\r\nzonal epitome of European life from Lapland to the Mediterranean. The\r\nlong incline from the summit of Mount Everest (8840 meters) in the\r\neastern Himalayas, through Darjeeling down to sea level at Calcutta,\r\ncomprises in a few miles the climatic and cultural range of Asia from\r\nArctic to Tropic.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Politico-economic value of varied relief.]\r\n\r\nFor the state, a territory of varied relief is highly beneficial,\r\nbecause it combines manifold forms of economic activity, a wide range of\r\ncrops, areas of specialized production mutually interdependent. It\r\ninduces a certain balance of urban and lief, rural life, which\r\ncontributes greatly to the health of the state.[1253] The steep slopes of\r\nDai Nippon, fertile only under spade tillage, will forever insure Japan\r\nthe persistence of a numerous peasantry. For geological and geographical\r\nreasons, as from national motives, therefore, Japan will probably never\r\nsacrifice its farmer to its industrial class, as England has done. On\r\nthe other hand, contrasted reliefs on a great territorial scale tend to\r\ninvade political solidarity. Tidewater and mountain Virginia were poor\r\nrunning-mates for a century before the Civil War, and then the mountain\r\nregion broke out of harness. Geographical contrasts made the unification\r\nof Germany difficult, and yet they have added to the economic and\r\nnational strength of the Empire. The history of Switzerland shows the\r\nhigh Alpine cantons always maintaining a political tug of war with the\r\ncantons of the marginal plain, and always suffering a defeat which was\r\ntheir salvation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Relief and climate.]\r\n\r\nThe chief effect of a varied relief is a varied climate. This changes\r\nwith altitude in much the same way as with latitude. Heat and absolute\r\nhumidity diminish, generally speaking, as height increases, while\r\nrainfall becomes greater up to a certain level. The effect of ascending\r\nand descending currents of air is to diminish the range of temperature\r\non mountain slopes and produce rather an oceanic type of climate. The\r\nlarger and more uniform a climatic district, the more conspicuously do\r\neven slight elevations form climatic islands, like the Harz Mountains in\r\nthe North German lowlands. A land of monotonous relief has a uniform\r\nclimate, while a region rich in vertical articulations is rich also in\r\nlocal varieties of climate.[1254] A highland of considerable elevation\r\nforms a cold district in the Temperate Zone, a temperate one in the\r\nTropics, and a moist one in a desert or steppe. Especially in arid and\r\ntorrid belts does the value of elevation for human life increase.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Altitude zones of economic and cultural development.]\r\n\r\nThe highlands of Mexico, South America and the Himalayan rim of India\r\nshow stratified zones of tropical, temperate, and arctic climate, to\r\nwhich plant, animal and human life conform. The response is conspicuous\r\nin the varying density of population in the successive altitude zones.\r\nCentral Asia shows a threefold cultural stratification of its\r\npopulation, each attended by the appropriate density, according to\r\nlocation in steppe, piedmont and mountain. The steppes have their\r\nscattered pastoral nomads; the piedmonts, with their irrigation streams,\r\nsupport sedentary agricultural peoples, concentrated at focal points in\r\ncommercial and industrial towns; the higher reaches of the mountains are\r\noccupied by sparse groups of peasants and shepherds, wringing from\r\nupland pasture and scant field a miserable subsistence. The same\r\nstratification appears in the Atlas Mountains, intensified on the\r\nsouthern slope by the contrast between the closely populated belt of the\r\npiedmont and the wandering Tuareg tribes of the Sahara on the one hand,\r\nand the sparse Berber settlements of the Atlas highlands on the other.\r\nThe long slope of Mount Kilimanjaro in German East Africa descends to a\r\ncoastal belt of steppe and desert, inhabited by Swahili cattle-breeders.\r\nIts piedmont, from 1000 feet above the plain up to 2400 feet,\r\nconstitutes a zone of rich irrigated plantations and gardens, densely\r\npopulated by peaceful folk of mingled Bantu and Hamitic blood. At 6000\r\nfeet, where forests cease, are found the kraals, cattle, sheep and goats\r\nof the semi-nomadic Masai of doubtful Hamitic stock, who raid the\r\ncoastal lowlands for cattle, and purchase all their vegetable food from\r\nthe tillage belt.[1255] [See maps page 105 and 487.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DENSITY OF POPULATION IN ITALY.]\r\n\r\nThis stratification assumes marked variations in the different\r\ngeographical zones. In Greenland life is restricted to the piedmont\r\ncoastal belt; above this rises the desert waste of the ice fields.\r\nNorway shows a tide-washed piedmont, containing a large majority of the\r\npopulation; above this, a steep slope sparsely inhabited; and higher\r\nstill, a wild plateau summit occupied in summer only by grazing herds or\r\nmigrant reindeer Lapps. Farther south the Alps show successive tiers of\r\nrural economy, again with their appropriate density of settlement. On\r\ntheir lower slope is found the vineyard belt, a region of highly\r\nintensive tillage, large returns upon labor, and hence of closely\r\ndistributed settlement. Above that is the zone of field agriculture,\r\nless productive and less thickly peopled. Higher still is the wide zone\r\nof hay farming and stock-raising, supporting a sparse, semi-nomadic\r\npopulation and characterized by villages which diminish with the\r\naltitude and cease beyond 2000 meters. On Aetna, located in the tropical\r\nMediterranean, three girdles of altitude have long been recognized,--the\r\ngirdle of agriculture, the forest belt, and the desert summit. But the\r\ntourist who ascends Aetna, passes from the coast through a zone of\r\norange and lemon groves, which are protected by temporary matting roofs\r\nagainst occasional frosts; then through vineyards and olive orchards\r\nwhich rise to 800 meters; then through a belt of summer crops rising to\r\n1550 meters, and varied between 1400 and 1850 meters elevation by\r\nstretches of chestnut groves, whose green expanse is broken here and\r\nthere by the huts of the forest guards, the highest tenants of the\r\nmountain. From these lonely dwellings down to the sea, density of\r\npopulation increases regularly to a maximum of over 385 to the square\r\nmile (150 to the square kilometer) near the coast.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Altitude and density belts in tropical highlands.]\r\n\r\nIn the tropical highlands of Mexico, Central and South America, on the\r\nother hand, concentration of population and its concomitant cultural\r\ndevelopment begin to appear above the 2000 meter line. Here are the\r\nchief seats of population. Mexico has three recognized altitude zones,\r\nthe cold, the temperate and the hot, corresponding to plateau, high\r\nslopes and coastal piedmont up to 1000 meters or 3300 feet; but the\r\nfirst two contain nine-tenths of the people. While the plateau has in\r\nsome sections a population dense as that of France, the lowlands are\r\nsparsely peopled by wild Indians and lumbermen. Ecuador has\r\nthree-fourths of its population crowded into the plateau basins (mean\r\nelevation 8000 feet or 2500 meters), enclosed by the ranges of the\r\nAndes. Peru presents a similar distribution, with a comparatively dense\r\npopulation on a plateau reaching to 11,000 feet (3500 meters) or more,\r\nthough its coastal belt, being healthful, dry, and fairly well supplied\r\nwith irrigation streams from the Andes, is better developed than any\r\nother similar district in tropical America.[1256] In Bolivia, 72 per cent\r\nof the total population live at an altitude of 6000 to 14,000 feet,\r\nwhile five out of the nine most densely peopled provinces lie at\r\nelevations over 11,000 feet.[1257] [See map page 9.]\r\n\r\nFrom Mexico to central Chile, the heavy rains from the trade-winds\r\nclothe the slopes with dense forests, except on the lee side of the high\r\nAndean wall of Peru and Chile, and reduce much of the piedmont to\r\nmalarial swamp and jungle. The discouragement to primitive tillage\r\nfound in the unequal fight with a tropical forest, the dryer, more\r\nbracing and healthful climate of the high intermontane basins, their\r\nfavorable conditions for agriculture by irrigation, and their naturally\r\ndefined location stimulating to early cultural development, all combined\r\nto concentrate the population of prehistoric America upon the high\r\nvalleys and plateaus. In historic times these centers have persisted,\r\nbecause the civilized or semi-civilized districts could be best\r\nexploited by the Spanish conquerors and especially because they yielded\r\nrich mineral wealth. Furthermore, the white population which has\r\nsubsequently invaded tropical America has to a predominant degree\r\nreinforced the native plateau populations, while the imported negroes\r\nand mulattoes have sought the more congenial climatic conditions found\r\nin the hot lowlands.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Increasing density with motive of protection.]\r\n\r\nThe relativity of geographical advantages in different historical\r\nperiods warns us against assuming in all times a sparsity of population\r\nin mountains, even when the adjoining lowlands offer many attractions of\r\nclimate and soil. In ages of incessant warfare, when the motive of\r\nsafety has strongly influenced distribution of population, protected\r\nmountain sites have attracted settlement from the exposed plains, and\r\nthus increased the relative density of population on the steep slopes.\r\nThe corrugated plateau of Armenia and Kurdistan, located on the uneasy\r\npolitical frontier of Russia, Persia and Asiatic Turkey, exposed for\r\ncenturies to nomadic invasion from the east, shows a sparser population\r\non its broad intermontane plains than on the surrounding ranges.\r\nSecurity makes the latter the choicer places of residence. Hence they\r\nare held by the overbearing and marauding Kurds, late-comers into the\r\nland, while the older and numerically weaker Armenians cower down on the\r\nlower levels.[1258] Here is an inversion of the usual order. The militantly\r\nstronger intruders, with no taste for agriculture, have seized the safer\r\nand commanding position on the hills, descending in winter with their\r\ncattle and horses to pasture and prey upon field and granary of the\r\nvalley folk, whose better soil is a questionable advantage.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Motive of protection in primitive peoples.]\r\n\r\nInstances of this sort, rare in modern times, because of of general\r\neconomic and social progress, multiply when we go into the history of\r\nprimitive or ancient peoples. The Cherokee Indians of the Southern\r\nAppalachians, surrounded by powerful neighbors in the Chickasaws, Creeks\r\nand the encroaching whites of the seaboard colonies, attacked by war\r\nparties of Shawnees and Iroquois from the north, located the bulk of\r\ntheir nation in the mountains. The Overhill and Middle towns, numbering\r\ntogether thirty-three and situated wholly in the mountains, comprised\r\nfour-fifths of their fighting force in 1775, while the nine towns\r\ndistributed in the flat lands of Georgia and South Carolina were small\r\nand unimportant. The Indians themselves distinguished these two\r\ndivisions of their country, the one as _Otarre_ or mountainous, and the\r\nothers as _Ayrate_ or low.[1259] Similarly in ancient Gaul the three\r\nstrongest tribes, the Sequani, Aedui, and Arverni, all had a large\r\nmountain nucleus. The Sequani held the Jura range with part of the Saône\r\nValley; the Aedui held the northeast corner of the Central Plateau and\r\nsome lands on the Saône, while the Arverni inhabited the western and\r\ncentral portion of the same highland. In a period of constant tribal\r\nmigrations and war, the occupants of these high, protected locations\r\nwere better able to defend themselves, and they maintained an adequate\r\nfood supply by holding some of the adjoining lowland. Archaeologists\r\ngenerally agree that in central and southern Italy settlement first took\r\nplace in the mountains, gradually extending thence down into the plains.\r\nThe superiority of the upland climate, the more abundant rainfall, the\r\ngreater security against attack offered by mountain sites, and the\r\nexcellent soil for agriculture resulting from the geological make-up of\r\nthe Apennines, all combined to draw thither primitive and later\r\nsettlement.[1260] [See map page 559.] Similarly in Britain of the Bronze\r\nAge, before the peoples of Aryan speech began to swarm over the island,\r\nthe primitive inhabitants, involved in constant clan or tribal warfare,\r\nplaced their villages on the hills, and left in the indestructible\r\nterraces on their slopes the evidences of a vanished race and an\r\noutgrown social order.[1261]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Geographic conditions affecting density of mountain\r\npopulation.]\r\n\r\nThe advance of civilization, which brought the ancient pirate-ridden\r\ncity from the inner edge of the coastal zone down to the wave-washed\r\nstrand, also drew the hill town down to the plain, and the mountain\r\npopulation from their inaccessible strongholds to the more accessible\r\nand productive valleys. These facts contain a hint. The future\r\ninvestigation of archaeological remains in high mountain districts may\r\nreveal at considerable elevations the oldest and hence lowest strata of\r\nprehistoric development, strata which, in the more attractive valleys,\r\nhave been obliterated or overlaid by later invasions of peoples and\r\ncultures. Ignoring this temporary attraction of population to protected\r\nmountain locations in ages of persistent warfare, we find that a\r\ncomparison of many countries reveals a decreasing food supply and\r\ndecreasing density of population, with every increase of height above a\r\ncertain altitude, except in favored mining regions and in some tropical\r\nlands, where better climatic conditions and freedom from malaria\r\ndistribute settlements far above the steaming and forest-choked\r\nlowlands. The density of population in mountains is influenced also by\r\nthe composition of the soil, which affects its fertility; by the grade\r\nand exposure of the slopes, which determine the ease and success of\r\ntillage; by the proximity of the highlands to teeming centers of lowland\r\npopulation, and by the general economic development of the people.\r\n\r\nIn Great Britain, the sparsest population is found in the sterile\r\nhighland moors of Scotland, where the county of Sutherland has only 11\r\ninhabitants to the square mile, Inverness only 20.[1262] These figures\r\nreveal also the remoteness of a far northern location. In the southern\r\nhalf of the island the sparsest populations are found in the Welsh\r\ncounty of Radnor, with 49 to the square mile, and in English\r\nWestmoreland with 85, both of them mountain regions, but reflecting in\r\ntheir larger figures their close proximity to the teeming industrial\r\ncenters of South Wales and Lancashire respectively. In France the most\r\nthinly settled _départements_ are Basses-Alpes with 43 to the square\r\nmile and Hautes-Alpes with 50, which again owe even these figures in\r\npart to their situation on the margin of the densely populated valley of\r\nthe middle Rhone. [See map page 559.] Norway, almost wholly a mountain\r\ncountry, averages only 18 souls to the square mile. Less than a thousand\r\nsquare miles of its territory are under cultivation, and these are\r\ndistributed in small deltas at the heads of the fiords, in low strips\r\nhere and there along its western coasts, or in the openings of its\r\nmountain valleys to the southeast. Here too is massed the larger part of\r\nits inhabitants. A barren granitic soil, unfavorable zonal location,\r\nexcessive rainfall, paucity of level land, leaving the \"upright farm\"\r\npredominant, and remoteness from any thickly settled areas, together\r\nwith the resulting enormous emigration, have combined to keep down\r\nNorway's population.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sparsity of population in the Alps.]\r\n\r\nIf we turn to Switzerland, a country poor in the resources of its land\r\nbut rich in the resourcefulness of its people, we find a high average\r\ndensity, 218 to the square mile; but this is due to the surprising\r\nindustrial development of the marginal plains, which show in the Canton\r\nof Geneva 1356 to the square mile, and in Canton Zurich 705, while the\r\nrugged upland of Graubünden (Grisons) shows only 38 to the square mile,\r\nUri only 48, and Wallis (Valais) only 59. How limited is the food supply\r\nof the country is evident from the fact that only 2400 square miles, or\r\nfifteen per cent. of its area, can be ranked as arable land, fit for\r\ngarden, orchard or grain field, while a larger proportion, or\r\ntwenty-eight per cent. is made wholly useless by watercourses, glaciers,\r\nrock and detritus. One half of the entire country lies above the region\r\nwhere agriculture is possible. In the Cantons of Uri and Valais, more\r\nthan half the area is absolutely unproductive, scarcely less in the\r\nGrisons, and a third even in sunny Ticino.[1263] The three strictly Alpine\r\nprovinces of Austria, Tyrol, Salzburg and Carinthia, reproduce\r\napproximately these geographic conditions. Nearly half of their area is\r\nuninhabited, and only one-seventh consists of arable land. In\r\nconsequence they support only 75 inhabitants to the square mile, while\r\njust outside the mountains, in the piedmont or Alpine foreland, this\r\ndensity is doubled.[1264] Many tracts of the Carpathians, especially about\r\nthe sources of the Theiss and Pruth and the wooded mountain borders of\r\nTransylvania, are among the most sparsely inhabited parts of Europe.[1265]\r\nJapan, ridged by steep volcanic ranges, drenched by mountain-born rains,\r\nstrewn with detritus from plunging torrents, can cultivate only 15.7 per\r\ncent. of its area, and is forced to leave 59 per cent. in forest\r\nreserves.[1266]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Terrace agriculture.]\r\n\r\nThese figures tell of the hard conditions of life characteristic of most\r\nmountain regions. Population under normal circumstances settles in the\r\nnarrow valleys between the ranges and along the borders of their\r\ndrainage stream. Soon, however, the food supply becomes inadequate for\r\nthe growing numbers, so that artificial means have to be employed to\r\nexpand the area of arable land. The soil on the mountain slopes is so\r\nthin that it yields only a scanty return to the labor of tillage.\r\nMoreover, under the operations of ploughing and harrowing, it is exposed\r\nto the danger of washing; so that after a few croppings the underlying\r\nrock of the mountain side may be laid bare, and all that was valuable in\r\nthe quondam field deposited in the valley as silt or swept away to\r\nenrich the distant delta of the nearest trunk river.\r\n\r\nTo obviate this difficulty and to secure the desired increase of arable\r\nland, mountain peoples the world over have resorted to terrace\r\nagriculture. This means hand-made fields. Parallel walls, one above the\r\nother, are constructed on horizontal lines across the face of the steep\r\nslopes, and the intervals between are filled with earth, carried thither\r\nin baskets on the peasants' backs. The soil must be constantly renewed\r\nand enriched by manure in the same way, and the masonry of the retaining\r\nwalls kept in repair. Whenever possible these costly terraced fields are\r\nlocated by preference on southward facing slopes, where the tilt of the\r\nland makes the fields catch the rays of the sun almost at right angles\r\nand thus counteracts the chill of the higher altitude, while the\r\nmountain behind protects the growing crops from cold northern winds.\r\nGood arable land, being limited in amount, commands a high price; and\r\nespecially do choice terraced fields in vine-growing countries, since\r\nthey make the best vineyards. Such fields in Switzerland will bring from\r\n$300 to $2,000 an acre, and are estimated to produce annually two\r\nbottles of wine for every square foot.[1267]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Geographical distribution.]\r\n\r\nTerrace agriculture, rare in new countries, in the more densely\r\npopulated Old World is widely distributed in mountainous areas. In\r\nGermany, where it is nearly identical with the culture of the vine, it\r\nis found along the steep slopes overlooking the valley of the Moselle\r\nand the Rhine; also in the Vosges Mountains, the Black Forest and the\r\nSwabian Jura, to the limited altitude in which the vine will flourish in\r\nthese northern regions. In the Alps it is widespread, and not confined\r\nto the culture of the vine. The traveler passing along the upper Rhone\r\nthrough the sunny Canton of Valais follows these terraced fields almost\r\nas far as Fiesch (altitude 3458 feet), beyond which agriculture proper\r\nbecomes more and more restricted on account of the elevation, and passes\r\nrapidly into the mere hay-making of a pastoral community. Between Leak\r\nand Sierre, not only the mountain sides, but also the steep gravel hills\r\nconstituting the old terminal moraine deposited by the receding Rhone\r\nglacier across the valley floor, are terraced to their very tops.\r\n\r\nTerrace cultivation prevails in the mountains of Italy; it is utilized\r\nnot only for the vine, but for olives, maize, oats, hemp, rye and flax.\r\nOn the gentler declivities of the Apennines, the terraced walls are\r\nwider apart and lower than on the steep slopes of the Ligurian Apennines\r\nand along the Riviera of the Maritime Alps, where the mountains rise\r\nabruptly from the margin of the sea.[1268] Careful and laborious terrace\r\ncultivation has produced in Italy a class of superior gardeners. The\r\nGenoese are famous for their skill in this sort of culture. The men from\r\nthe Apennine plateau of the Abruzzi readily find positions in the\r\nlowlands as expert gardeners.[1269]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Terrace culture of the Saracens.]\r\n\r\nThe Saracens of Spain in the tenth century converted every mountain\r\nslope into a succession of green terraces. They built walls of heavy\r\nmasonry, and brought water, loam, and fertilizing materials from great\r\ndistances. The slopes of Granada back of Malaga and Almeria were covered\r\nwith vineyards. Every foot of land susceptible of cultivation was turned\r\nto account, every drop of water from the ill-timed winter rains was\r\nconserved for the growing season. The application of intelligence and\r\nlabor to tillage enabled the Hispano-Arab provinces to support a dense\r\npopulation.[1270] These Saracen cultivators had come from the severest\r\ntraining school in all Eurasia. Where the arid tableland of Arabia is\r\nbuttressed on the southwestern front by high coast ranges (6000 to\r\n10,500 feet or 2000 to 3200 meters) is Yemen, rich in its soil of\r\ndisintegrated trap rock, adequately watered by the dash of the southwest\r\nmonsoons against its towering ridges; but practically the whole country\r\nis atilt. Consequently the mountains have been terraced from the base\r\noften up to 6000 feet. The country presents the aspect of vast\r\nagricultural amphitheaters, in which the narrow paths of ancient paving\r\nzigzag up and up through successive zones of production. Here is a wide\r\nrange of fruits--oranges, lemons, figs, dates, bananas and coffee; then\r\napricots, apples, plums, grapes, quinces, peaches, together with grains\r\nof various zonal distribution, such as millet, maize, wheat and barley.\r\nThe terrace walls are from five to eight feet high, but toward the top\r\nof the mountains they often increase to fifteen feet. Though laid\r\nwithout mortar, they are kept in perfect repair. Reservoirs filled with\r\nwater from the two rainy seasons, supply the irrigation channels.[1271] In\r\nthe narrow valleys of the Nejd plateau in central Arabia and on the\r\nmountain slopes of Oman are found the same irrigated gardens and\r\nterraced plantations. This laborious tillage underlay the prosperity of\r\nthe ancient Sabaean monarchy of Yemen, as it explains the population of\r\n35,000 souls who occupy the modern capital of Sanaa, located at an\r\naltitude of 7600 feet (2317 meters).[1272]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: In the Himalayas.]\r\n\r\nTurning eastward, we find terrace agriculture widely distributed in\r\nHimalayan lands. The steep mountain sides of the Vale of Kashmir are\r\ncultivated thus to a considerable height. The terraces are irrigated by\r\ncontour channels constructed along the hillsides, which bring the water\r\nfor miles from distant snow-fed streams. Their shelf-like fields are\r\ngreen with fruit orchards and almond groves, with vineyards and grain\r\nfields.[1273] The terraced slopes about the Himalayan hill-station of\r\nSimla (elevation 7100 to 8000 feet) feed the summer population of\r\nEnglish, who there take refuge from the deadly heat of the plains. The\r\nmountain sections of the native states of Nepal and Bhutan present the\r\nview of slopes cut into gigantic stairs, each step a field of waving\r\nrice kept saturated by irrigating streams from abundant mountain\r\nsprings. Farther north, where Himalayas and Hindu Kush meet, terrace\r\nagriculture is combined with irrigation in the high Gilgit valleys, and\r\nfarther still along that mere gash running down from the Pamir dome,\r\ncalled the Hunza Valley. Here live the once lawless robber tribes of\r\nthe Hunzas and Nagaris, whose conquest cost the British a dangerous and\r\nexpensive campaign in 1892, but whose extensive terraces of irrigated\r\nfields and evidences of skillful tillage gave the whole country an\r\nappearance of civilization strangely at variance with the barbarous\r\ncharacter of its inhabitants.[1274]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: In Tibet and China.]\r\n\r\nNorth of the outer Himalayan range, near the sources of the Indus and\r\nSutlej rivers in Ladak or Western Tibet, this same form of cultivation\r\nhas been resorted to by the retarded and isolated Mongolian inhabitants.\r\nHere at an altitude of 11,000 feet or more (3354 meters), along mountain\r\nranges of primitive rock yielding only a scant and sterile soil,\r\nterraces are laboriously constructed; their surfaces are manured with\r\nburnt remains of animal excrements, which must first serve as fuel in\r\nthis timberless land before they are applied to the ground. In this\r\nstronghold of Buddhism almost every lamasery has its terraced fields\r\nyielding good crops of grain and fruit.[1275] In the densely populated Sze\r\nChuan province of western China, cultivation has climbed from the\r\nfertile basins of the Min and upper Yangtze rivers far up the\r\nsurrounding mountains, where it is carried on terraces to the foot of\r\nvertical cliffs.[1276] Farther north where the mountain province of Shensi\r\noccupies the rise of land from the Chinese lowlands to the central\r\nhighlands of Asia, terraces planted with wheat or other grains cover the\r\nmountain slopes.[1277]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: In ancient Peru.]\r\n\r\nTerrace tillage is rare in new countries of extensive plains, like the\r\nUnited States and Canada, where the level lands still suffice for the\r\nagricultural needs of the people; but in the confined mountain basins\r\nand valleys which made up the Inca's territory in ancient Peru, every\r\navailable natural field was utilized for cultivation, and terraces\r\nbrought the obstinate mountain sides under the dominion of the Andean\r\npeasant. They were constructed, a hundred or more in number, rising 1000\r\nor 1500 feet above the floor of the highland valley, contracting in\r\nwidth as they rose, till the uppermost one was a narrow shelf only two\r\nfeet broad. These were extended by communal labor year after year, with\r\nincrease of population, just as to-day in Java and the neighboring\r\nislands, and became the property of the Inca. Streams from the higher\r\nslopes were conducted in canals and distributed from terrace to terrace,\r\nto irrigate and fertilize. These terraces therefore yielded the best\r\ncrops of potatoes, maize and pulse. The cultivable area was further\r\nextended by floating gardens, consisting of rafts covered with earth,\r\nwhich floated on the surface of lakes.[1278] They existed in ancient\r\nMexico also,[1279] and are used to-day in the lakes and streams of Tibet\r\nand Kashmir[1280] and the rivers of overcrowded China.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Terrace agriculture in mountainous islands.]\r\n\r\nMountainous islands, born of volcanic forces or the partial submergence\r\nof coastal ranges, have steep surfaces and scant lowlands. Their\r\ninhabitants command limited area at best. Driven to agriculture by their\r\nisolation, drawn to it by the favorable oceanic climate, such islands\r\ndevelop terrace tillage in its most pronounced form. On the precipitous\r\npitch of Teneriffe, every particle of alluvial soil is collected to make\r\ngardens. Long lines of camels, laden with boxes of earth, may be seen\r\ncoming almost daily into the town of Santa Cruz, bringing soil for the\r\nterraces.[1281] This is desperate agriculture. Irrigated terraces scar the\r\nsteep slopes of many Polynesian islands.[1282] They are highly developed\r\namong the Malay Battaks of Sumatra, especially for rice culture.[1283] In\r\nJava, Bali and Lombok they reach a perfection hardly equalled elsewhere\r\nin the world. In Java they begin at an altitude of 1000 feet, cutting\r\nmain and branch valleys into amphitheaters, and covering hundreds of\r\nsquare miles.[1284] On the volcanic slopes of Lombok the terrace plots\r\nvary from many acres to a few square yards, according to the grade,\r\nwhile a complete system of irrigation uses every brook to water the\r\nterraces. Here as in Java the work began at a very early period, when it\r\nwas probably introduced among the native Malays by Brahmans from\r\nIndia.[1285] Japan, two-thirds of whose area is mountainous, has terraced\r\nits steep valley walls often up to 2000 feet or more, and utilized every\r\npatch of ground susceptible of tillage.[1286]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Among mountain savages.]\r\n\r\nA mountain environment often occasions a forced development in the form\r\nof agriculture among peoples who otherwise still linger in a low stage\r\nof barbarism or savagery. The wild, head-hunting Igorots, inhabiting the\r\nCordilleras of north central Luzon, have levelled the face of their\r\nmountains into a series of platforms, held by retaining walls from\r\ntwenty to thirty feet high. On these they cultivate upland rice at an\r\naltitude of 5000 feet. The Igorot province of Bontoc contains valleys in\r\nwhich every available foot of land is terraced for rice, and which\r\npresent artificial landscapes vividly recalling Japan. Labor is the\r\nheritage of each inhabitant. Every man, woman and child down to ten\r\nyears of age shares in the work of providing food.[1287] Africa shows\r\nparallel cases. The Angoss people, a savage negro tribe who occupy part\r\nof the Murchison Range in northern Nigeria, have mapped out all their\r\nsloping land into little terraces, sometimes only a foot or two wide.\r\nOne of their peaks, 4135 feet high, has its plateau top covered with\r\npopulous villages, owing to the protection of the site, and every inch\r\nof its slope cut into terraces planted with millet and guinea corn.[1288]\r\nA more primitive form of this tillage is found in the country of the\r\nMarunga negroes, who occupy the steep western face of the rift valley\r\nfilled by Lake Tanganyika. Here Cameron found the surface not regularly\r\nterraced, but retaining walls of loose stones disposed at intervals,\r\nwhich served to hold the soil in place, without greatly altering the\r\nnatural slope. The scene recalled the terraced heights of Switzerland,\r\nand the people working there looked like flies on a wall.[1289] In the\r\nsemi-arid country of Sudanese Darfur, where only the mountain districts\r\nare well watered and thickly populated, small terraces for grain and\r\nmelons cover all the slopes.[1290]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fertilizing]\r\n\r\nMountain agriculture is necessarily laborious. The paucity of arable\r\nland precludes the possibility of letting fields lie fallow. These, to\r\nprevent exhaustion, must be constantly and abundantly fertilized, all\r\nthe more as conditions of excessive subaërial denudation found in the\r\nsteep slope and usual heavy rainfall of mountains, as well as possible\r\nglacial scouring of the land in the past, have greatly attenuated the\r\nlayer of soil called upon to support plant life. The Swiss or Tyrolese\r\nfarmer cherishes his manure pile as at once source and badge of his\r\nwealth. After harvest it is carted or carried in baskets not only to\r\nthe terraces, but also to the wide alluvial fan that grows his oats and\r\nrye, to his meadows and hay fields. Both in Mexico and Peru the soil\r\nreceived a dressing of poudrette. Manuring was most extensive where\r\npopulation was densest, as in the isolated mountain valleys opening out\r\nupon the desert coast of Peru. Every kind of organic refuse was\r\nutilized, and fish was buried with the kernels of maize as a fertilizer.\r\nThe deposits of guano found on the headlands and off-shore islands were\r\nused from the remotest times. Different guano beds were assigned to the\r\nseveral provinces, and the breeding places of the birds were protected\r\nby law.[1291] Ashes and decayed wood were employed for the same purpose,\r\nor plants were dug into the soil, while human manure was in Mexico a\r\nmarketable commodity as in China.[1292]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Economy of level land for houses and villages.]\r\n\r\nIn all mountain regions where population has begun to press upon the\r\nmeager limits of subsistence, level land and soil are at a premium. In\r\nancient Peru space was begrudged for the dead.[1293] Cities covered\r\nconsiderable space on the roomy intermontane plateaus; but in the narrow\r\nlateral valleys, houses and temples were built on rocks, in order to\r\nreserve every fertile spot for agriculture.[1294] The traveler notices the\r\nsame thing throughout the Alps. Compact villages cling to the mountain\r\nsides, leaving the alluvial hem of the stream or level glacial terrace\r\nfree for the much needed fields. Only in broad longitudinal valleys,\r\nlike that of Andermatt, do the settlements complacently spread out their\r\nskirts, or on wide alluvial fans where transverse valleys debouch upon\r\nthe plains. The mountaineers of the Crimea construct their houses\r\nagainst the precipices, excavating into their face and building up the\r\nfront, with stones, and thus reserve the gentler slopes for vineyards\r\nand gardens.[1295] In the Kangra, Kumaon, and Garhwal districts of the\r\nBritish Himalayas, the large Indian villages of the plains give place to\r\nsmall hamlets or detached homesteads, scattered here and there wherever\r\noccasional patches of soil on a hillside or in a narrow valley offer\r\nhope of sustenance. These hamlets or dwellings are located on the sides\r\nof the mountains, because level spots which can be irrigated must be\r\nreserved for rice fields.[1296] The high site is also freer from malaria.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Perpendicular villages]\r\n\r\nIn the high Himalayan province of Ladak or Western Tibet, this principle\r\nof land economy reaches a climax. All settlement is on the\r\nperpendicular. The abrupt mountain sides are honey-combed with tombs,\r\nvillages and Buddhist lamaseries in the detached localities where\r\npopulation occurs. A pleasure walk through one of these Tibetan towns\r\nmeans a climb by steep flights of steps hewn out of the rock, varied by\r\na saunter up ladders, where the sheer face of a cliff must be surmounted\r\nto reach the houses on a ledge above.[1297] Pictures of these recall\r\nforcibly the cliff-dwellings of the Pueblo Indians. Even the important\r\nmarket city of Leh covers the lower slope of the mountain at an altitude\r\nof 11,500 feet, and from its height overlooks the cultivated fields in\r\nthe sandy valley bed below, made fertile by irrigating streams from\r\ndebouching cañons.[1298] The Ladak villages always shun the plains. The\r\ndesire to economize level arable land does not alone dictate this choice\r\nof sites, however; the motive of protection against inundation, when the\r\nsnows melt and the streams swell, and also, to some degree, against\r\nhostile attack, is an additional factor. In the mountainous parts of\r\novercrowded China, again, the food problem is the dominant motive. In\r\nthe rugged highland province of Shensi, a village of several hundred\r\npeople covers only a few acres, and rises in closely packed tiers of\r\nhouses against the mountain side.[1299] In the wilder, half-conquered\r\nparts of Sze Chuan the villages crown the lower peaks, cling to the base\r\nof the mountains, or are perched on ledges of rock overlooking the\r\ngorges. Among the steep cliffs bordering the upper Yangtze, occupied\r\nchiefly by the timid, displaced Mantze aborigines, at an altitude of\r\n10,000 feet, small platforms resting on beams projecting from the sheer\r\nmountain face support minute houses, whose backs burrow into the cliff\r\nbehind. The small children are tied to the door post, to keep them from\r\nfalling into the millet field below. The house is accessible only by\r\nbolts driven into the cliff. Above and below is the farm--small patches\r\nof tilled soil, often not larger than a bath towel, to which the\r\ncultivator lowers himself by a rope.[1300] Here life hovers on the brink\r\nof death and despair.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mountain pastures and stock-raising.]\r\n\r\nPaucity of arable land in mountain regions leads to the utilization of\r\nthe untillable slopes for stock grazing. This industry is always a\r\nvaluable ally to mountain agriculture on account of the manure which it\r\nyields; but in high altitudes, where the steepness or rockiness of the\r\nsoil, cold and the brevity of the growing season restrict or eliminate\r\ncereal crops, it becomes the dominant occupation of the inhabitants,\r\nwhile agriculture takes a subordinate place, limited to the production\r\nof hay and fodder for the winter feeding of the stock. Above the line of\r\ntree growth flourish the natural summer pastures up to the border of\r\nperpetual snow; and just below lies a zone which, if cleared of its\r\nforests, supports a thick carpet of grass and herbage, though too cold\r\nto ripen grain.\r\n\r\nThe high pastures are particularly nourishing. Cows feeding here in the\r\nAlps give better milk than the \"home\" or valley cows, though a smaller\r\nquantity. Sheep and goats do equally well, but swine are profitable only\r\nas a by-product, to utilize the refuse of the cheese and butter\r\nindustry. The area of these pastures far exceeds that of arable land in\r\nmountain regions. In Switzerland they comprise about 27 per cent. of the\r\ntotal productive area; hay meadows 24 per cent., but fields and gardens\r\nonly 20 per cent.[1301] In the Austrian province of Salzburg, pastures\r\nmake up 13.3 per cent., hay meadows 34.5 per cent., and tilled fields\r\nonly 11.7 per cent. of the total productive area. In the Tyrol the\r\nfigures are much the same.[1302] Since Norway has over 67 per cent. of its\r\ntotal area in bare mountains, snow fields, bogs and lakes, it is not\r\nsurprising to find only 7.6 per cent. in pastures, 2.2 per cent. in\r\nmeadows, and 0.7 per cent. in grain fields; but here the pastures are\r\nten times the arable area.[1303] The season of the summer feeding on the\r\ngrass lands is short. In the so-called High Alps it frequently lasts\r\nonly six or seven weeks, in the Grisons at most thirteen weeks[1304] and\r\nin Norway from two to three months.[1305]\r\n\r\nHigh mountain regions, practically restricted to this _Graswirthschaft_,\r\nsoon reach their maximum of prosperity and population. The amount of hay\r\nsecured for the winter feeding limits the number of cattle, and the\r\nnumber of the cattle, through their manure, fixes the valley hay supply.\r\nAlpine pastures cannot be enlarged, and they may be reduced by\r\naccidents of nature, such as landslides, devastating torrents, or\r\nadvance of ice fields or glaciers. They cannot be improved by capital\r\nand labor, and they may deteriorate chemically by exhaustion. The\r\nconstant export of butter and cheese from Alpine pastures in recent\r\ntimes, without substitution by any fertilizer beyond the local manure,\r\nhas caused the diminution of phosphoric acid in the soil and hence\r\nimpoverishment. Canton Glarus has shown a steady decline since 1630 in\r\nthe number of cows which its mountain pastures can support.[1306] Many\r\nother Alpine districts show the same deterioration.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mountain herdsman and shepherds.]\r\n\r\nThe remoteness of these highland pastures from the permanent villages\r\nnecessitates _Sennenwirthschaft_, or the maintenance of out-farms and\r\nshepherds on the mountains during the grazing season. This involves a\r\nsemi-nomadic existence for such inhabitants as serve as herdmen. In\r\nJune, as soon as the high pastures begin to grow green, cattle, sheep\r\nand goats ascend step by step in the wake of summer, as she climbs the\r\nslope, and they return in autumn to the valleys. There they feed on the\r\nstubble of hay and grain fields, till the increasing cold confines them\r\nto their low stables. The hut of the _Senner_ or _Saeter_, as the\r\nherdsman is variously called in Switzerland and Norway, consists of a\r\nliving room and a smaller apartment for making butter and cheese, while\r\nagainst the steep slope is a rude stone shelter for the cattle and\r\ngoats. The predominance of summer pastures has made cattle-raising a\r\nconspicuous part of agriculture in the Alps and in Norway. In many parts\r\nof Switzerland, cattle are called \"wares\" and the word cheese is used as\r\na synonym for food, as we use bread. A Swiss peasant who has a\r\nreputation for cheese making is popular with the girls.[1307] Here even\r\nCupid turns dairy expert.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Communal ownership of mountain pastures.]\r\n\r\nSince it is scarcely practicable to divide these highland pastures, they\r\nhave generally remained communal property, whether in Norway,[1308]\r\nSwitzerland, the Bavarian Alps, the British Himalayan districts,[1309]\r\nNepal and Bhutan,[1310] or Kashmir.[1311] In Europe their use is generally\r\nregulated. As a rule, a Swiss villager may keep on the _Allmende_ during\r\nthe summer as many head of cattle as he is able to stall-feed during\r\nthe winter. Any in excess of this number must be paid for at a fixed\r\nrate to the village or commune treasury.[1312] Hay-sheds and herdsmen's\r\nhuts mark these districts of temporary occupation near the altitude\r\nlimits of human life throughout Europe. In Asia, likewise, are to be\r\nfound small villages, inhabited only in summer by herdsmen tending their\r\nflocks. Such is the hamlet of Minemerg, located at an altitude of about\r\n8000 feet at the southern entrance to the Borzil Pass over the Western\r\nHimalayas, and Sonamerg (altitude 8650 feet or 2640 meters) just below\r\nthe Zogi La Pass, both of them surrounded by rich meadows on the\r\nnorthern rim of the Vale of Kashmir.[1313]\r\n\r\nThe utilization of mountain pastures for stock raising is almost\r\nuniversal. In the arid highlands of Central Asia, it is the essential\r\nsupplement to the pastoral nomadism of the steppes and deserts, and to\r\nthe limited sedentary agriculture found along the irrigated piedmont\r\nslopes. Here and elsewhere the animal raised varies widely-the llama and\r\nvicuna in Peru, which thrive best at 10,000 to 13,000 feet elevation,\r\nand multiply rapidly on the _ichu_ or coarse grass which clothes the\r\nslopes of the higher Andes up to snow line; sheep, goats, yaks and herds\r\nof dzo, a useful hybrid between yak and cow, in the highland districts\r\nof Sze Chuan. Here the Mantze mountaineers lock their houses and leave\r\ntheir villages deserted, while they camp with their herds on the high\r\npastures at 10,000 feet or more.[1314] Only economical, ingenious Japan\r\nhas failed to develop stock raising, though mountains comprise\r\ntwo-thirds of its area. The explanation has often been sought in\r\nBuddhism, which inhibits the use of animal food; but this religious rule\r\nprobably found ready acceptance in Japan, just because the paucity of\r\nanimal food made its observance easy, for the fish industry of the\r\nEmpire never suffered from the inhibition. The reason is probably to be\r\nsought elsewhere. The native grass of Japan, which relentlessly crowds\r\nout all imported grazing crops, is a bamboo grass with sharp, hard,\r\nserrated edges, and is said to cut the entrails of horses and sheep.[1315]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Haymaking in high mountains.]\r\n\r\nWhile the high pastures are ample for the summer feeding, the chief\r\nproblem of mountain stock-farmers is to secure feed for the winter\r\nsupport of their animals. This taxes their industry and ingenuity to the\r\nutmost. While the herdsmen are away tending their charges on the\r\nheights, the rest of the population are kept busy at home, getting\r\nfodder for the six or seven months of stall-feeding. This includes the\r\ncultivation of hardy crops like oats, rye and barley, which will mature\r\nat a great altitude, hay-making and collecting twigs and even leaves for\r\nthe less fastidious goats. In Switzerland as in Norway the art of mowing\r\nhas reached its highest pitch. Grass only three inches high is cut\r\nthrice yearly. The Norwegian peasant gathers a small hay harvest from\r\nthe roofs of his house and barns, and from the edges of the highways. In\r\nSwitzerland not a spear of grass escapes. In places inaccessible to\r\ncattle and goats, the peasant gathers hay by the handful with crampons\r\non his feet, generally from the ledges of cliffs. He stacks it in one\r\nspot, and brings it down to the valley by sledge in winter. He is the\r\n_Wildheuer_ or wild hay gatherer. His life is so dangerous, that the law\r\npermits only one _Wildheuer_ to a family.[1316] In high Alpine cantons\r\nthis office is the privilege of the poor.[1317] The traveler in Norway\r\nfrequently sees huge bundles of hay sliding down to the valley on wires\r\nstretched from some high point on the precipitous fiord wall. This\r\nrepresents the harvest from isolated spots or from the field of the\r\nsummer shepherd. In the vicinity of every _saeter_ hut, a plot of ground\r\nis fenced in, enriched with the manure gathered during the summer, and\r\nutilized to grow fine nourishing grass, which is mown and transported\r\ndown to the valley farm.[1318] Here economy of vegetative resources\r\nreaches its climax.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Methods of curing hay in mountains.]\r\n\r\nIn mountain regions of heavy rainfall, thick dew and numerous cloudy\r\ndays, it becomes a problem to get the hay dried and stored before a\r\ndrenching shower comes. In many parts of Switzerland, therefore, the\r\npeasant on a clear morning cuts a limited amount of grass. This, with\r\nthe help of his wife and children, he diligently turns and tosses at\r\nshort intervals all day long, thus subjecting it to a rapid curing\r\nprocess by the action of the wind and the sun, whose rays are doubly\r\neffective in the rarefied air of the heights. In the evening the hay is\r\nmade up into bundles and carried on his back to the barn. In other parts\r\nof Switzerland the green hay is hung on horizontal poles arranged\r\nagainst the sunny side of the chalet and under its projecting roof, thus\r\nexposed to the heat and protected from the rain till cured. In Norway\r\nthe same purpose is achieved by setting up in the fields racks\r\nsupporting long horizontal bars, over which the newly cut grass is hung.\r\nThere it is exposed to the gentle fanning of the wind and penetrated by\r\nthe warmth of the sun, in the short intervals when the sky is not\r\novercast; and during a shower it sheds the water immediately, so that a\r\nminimum of harm is done. In the mountains of Germany, the hay is stacked\r\non cone-shaped racks made of poles, with lateral projections which\r\nsupport the grass; thus the air can circulate freely inside the hollow\r\ncone, which is lifted well above the ground. Elsewhere sharpened stakes\r\nprovided with cross bars are simply driven into the ground, and on these\r\nthe hay is draped till cured.\r\n\r\nMountain hay-making leaves nothing to chance; too much depends upon the\r\ncrop. In fact, at high altitudes it becomes the only crop. Cereal\r\nculture drops off with every increase of elevation. Norway has few\r\nfields above 1600 feet;[1319] even barley fails to ripen above 2600 feet.\r\nIn the mountains of Würtenberg we find pure _Graswirthschaft_ at 3000\r\nfeet elevation, with only a small garden patch near the dwelling.[1320] It\r\nis interesting to take a tramp up one of the longitudinal or lateral\r\nvalleys of the Alps, and observe the economic basis of life gradually\r\nchange from agriculture to hay-making, till in some high-laid Alpine\r\ncirque, like Bad Leuk or Barmaz at the head of the Val d'Ilez, one sees\r\nonly meadows and an occasional potato patch, which impresses the\r\nlowlander as a last despairing effort in the struggle for existence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Winter industries of mountain peoples.]\r\n\r\nWhere climate and soil do so little for the support of life, man must do\r\nmuch. Work must in some way be made to compensate for an ungenerous\r\nNature. The closely housed existence necessitated by the long severe\r\nwinters of high altitudes stimulates industries in the home. The winter\r\nfeeding of the stock involves little labor, so the abundant leisure\r\nwould otherwise be wasted. Hence it is no accident that we find almost\r\neverywhere native mountain industries in a high state of development,\r\nand often characterized by an artistic beauty which seems to be the one\r\nflower of this barren environment. They are naturally based upon the\r\nlocal raw materials of the mountains, such as wood, metals, clays, and\r\nespecially the wool of sheep and goats. Moreover, their products are\r\narticles of small bulk and large value, adapted to costly mountain\r\ntransportation. Those of Kashmir are typical-carved wood, artistic metal\r\nwork in silver and copper, puttoo cloth, carpets and the famous Kashmir\r\nshawls.[1321] The stark life of Tibet shows in its industries an\r\nunexpected richness and beauty. The men spin and weave wool into puttoo\r\ncloth of all grades; some of it is extraordinarily fine in texture and\r\ncolor, and is exported by caravan in considerable quantity to northern\r\nChina and Mongolia. Pastil sticks, made of aromatic wood and impregnated\r\nwith musk and gold-dust, are a conspicuous commodity in the trade with\r\nPeking. Tibet is rich in metals, especially silver and gold. Even the\r\nnomad shepherds of the tablelands know how to purify gold-dust over a\r\nfire of argols; hence it is not surprising that the settlements in the\r\nirrigated mountain valleys should develop real artists in\r\nmetallurgy.[1322] The province of Dèrgè, which excels in metal work,\r\nproduces swords, guns, teapots, bells and seals of extremely artistic\r\ndesign and perfect finish.[1323] The jewelry of Tibet suggests Byzantine\r\nwork. It includes ear-rings and charm boxes of gold and carved\r\nturquoise, and is marked by the same delicate finish. But whether the\r\nTibetan is working in wood, gold, brass, or wool, he uses native designs\r\nof real merit, and shows the expert craftsman's hand.[1324] His activities\r\nrecall the metal work of the Caucasus and the famous rugs of Daghestan.\r\n\r\nTurning to Europe we find watch and clock making in the Black Forest and\r\nthe Jura, wood-carving in the Swiss and Norwegian mountains, bobbin lace\r\nin the Erz range and in Alpine Appenzell, and the far more beautiful\r\nItalian product of the rugged Abruzzi and the Frioulian Alps. The\r\nSlovaks of highland Hungary are expert in wire-drawing,[1325] and the\r\npeasant of the central Apennines makes from the gut of his goats the\r\nfinest violin strings in the world, the so-called Roman strings.[1326] The\r\nlow Thuringian and Franconian Forests, which harbor denser populations,\r\nhave by a minute subdivision of labor turned their local resources to\r\nthe making of dolls, which they supply to the markets of the world.\r\nHere too the manufacture of glass articles, porcelains, majolica and\r\nterra-cotta flourishes.[1327] Most of these mountain industries merely\r\nsupplement the scant agricultural resources; they represent the efforts\r\nof industrious but hard pressed people to eke out their meager\r\nsubsistence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Overpopulation and emigration.]\r\n\r\nThe application of steam to industry has converted mountain regions of\r\nabundant mineral wealth into centers of production for the markets of\r\nthe world. But this is the history of only the last century, and of only\r\nfavored mountain regions. The utilization of waterpower for electricity\r\nin factories is transforming the piedmont belts of the Alps and\r\nApennines; but life in the interior of these ranges remains unaltered by\r\nthe denser population at their base, except for the increased demand for\r\nthe butter, milk and cheese of the highland pastures. For the world at\r\nlarge, therefore, the obvious and persistent fact of mountain economy is\r\na scanty food supply secured by even the most intelligent and untiring\r\nlabor, and a fixed tendency to overpopulation. The simplest remedy for\r\nthis evil is emigration, a fact which Malthus observed.[1328] Hence\r\nemigration is an almost universal phenomenon in highland regions.\r\nSometimes it is only seasonal. It takes place in the fall after the\r\nfield work is over, and is due to the paucity of industries possible in\r\nthe mountains during the winter. It seems to be a recurrence of that\r\nnomadic note in the _motif_ of mountain life--that migration in summer\r\nupward to the borders of the snow, in winter downward to the sun-warmed\r\nplains. In autumn the Swiss descend from the Jura and Alps in great\r\nnumbers to cities, seeking positions as servants or pastry-cooks. The\r\nAuvergnats leave their home by the thousand in the fall, when snow\r\ncovers the mountains, to work in the cities as hewers of stone and\r\ndrawers of water, then return in summer to resume their tasks in field\r\nand pasture, bringing back sums of money which noticeably enrich the\r\nhome districts.[1329]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Forms of temporary emigration.]\r\n\r\nThis seasonal emigration often assumes the form of peddling, in order to\r\ndispose of small home-made wares. From the Basilicata and Modena\r\nApennines the young men follow the pedler's trade, but the Basilicata\r\nvillage of Viggiano furnishes Italy with many wandering musicians.[1330]\r\nThe Kabyles of the Atlas Mountains go out in parties of two or three in\r\nthe fall, and hawk every kind of goods, bringing back from their journey\r\nquantities of wool for home weaving.[1331] The emigration may last for\r\nseveral years, but finally the love of home generally calls the\r\nmountaineer back to his rugged hills. The Galicians of the Cantabrian\r\nMountains of northern Spain leave their poor country for a time for the\r\nricher provinces of Portugal and Spain, where they become porters,\r\nwater-carriers and scavengers, and are known as boorish, but industrious\r\nand honest. The women from the neighboring mountain province of Asturias\r\nare the professional wet-nurses of Spain. They are to be seen in every\r\naristocratic household of Madrid, but return to the mountains with their\r\nsavings when their period of service ends.[1332] In mountainous\r\nBasutoland, the Kaffir Switzerland of South Africa, arable land and\r\npastures are utilized as completely as local methods of husbandry\r\npermit; and yet the native Kaffirs go in large numbers--28,000 out of a\r\ntotal population of 220,000 in 1895--to work in the mines of Kimberley\r\nand the Witwatersrand. They also return in time with their savings.[1333]\r\nSimilarly the Battaks of the rugged mountain-rimmed plateau of western\r\nSumatra emigrate in increasing numbers to the lowlands, and hire\r\nthemselves out for a term of years on the Dutch plantations.[1334]\r\n\r\nAnother interesting and once rather widespread phase of this temporary\r\nemigration appears in the mercenary troops formerly drawn from mountain\r\nregions. After the Burgundian wars of the fifteenth century, the Swiss\r\nbecame the mercenaries of Europe, and in 1503 were first employed as\r\npapal life-guards. They served the kings of France from Louis XL till\r\nthe tragedy of the Tuileries in 1792; and in that country and elsewhere\r\nthey made the name \"Switzer\" a synonym for guard or attendant,[1335] till\r\nin 1848 the mercenary system was abolished. The pressure of population\r\nat home and the military spirit of the Scotch Highlanders once led the\r\nyoung Gaels to seek their fortunes in military service abroad, as in the\r\narmy of Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden.[1336] Gurkhas from Himalayan Nepal,\r\nan independent state, are employed in considerable numbers in the Indian\r\narmy to-day, and constitute one of the most reliable divisions of the\r\nnative troops. In January, 1901, there were 12,797 Gurkhas drawing pay\r\nfrom the Indian government as soldiers, besides 6000 more employed as\r\nmilitary police, porters, and in other capacities.[1337] Similarly ancient\r\nArcadia, the mountain core of Peloponnesus, was a constant hive of\r\nmercenaries.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Permanent emigration.]\r\n\r\nOften, however, permanent emigration is the result, robbing the mountain\r\npopulation of its most enterprising element, Piedmontese, Bergamese, and\r\nFrioulians from the Italian Alps leave their country in large numbers.\r\nMany of them find work in Marseilles and other towns of southern France,\r\ninfusing an Italian strain into the population there and making serious\r\ncompetition for the local French. A proverb says there is no country in\r\nthe world without sparrows and Bergamese.[1338] Geneva, once the citadel\r\nof Calvinism, is to-day a Catholic town, owing to the influx of Catholic\r\nlaborers from Alpine Savoy. The overflow of the redundant population of\r\nthis mountain province has given the Swiss canton a character\r\ndiametrically opposed to its traditions.[1339] The Chinese provinces of\r\nChili and Manchuria have been largely populated by immigrants from the\r\nbarren mountain peninsula of Shantung; Manchuria has thereby been\r\nconverted from an alien into a native district.[1340]\r\n\r\nEmigration on so large a scale exercises far reaching economic and\r\nhistorical influences. Norse colonization contributed interesting\r\nchapters to the history of Europe in the ninth and tenth centuries.\r\nNorwegians who have flocked to America have made a deep impress upon our\r\nNorthwestern States. Switzerland in 1902 and 1903 gave as 9500 of its\r\nsubjects, a valuable contribution. Scotchmen of Highland birth are\r\nscattered over the whole world, carrying with them everywhere their\r\nsturdy qualities of character. Even the stay-at-home French lose\r\nemigrants from their mountain districts. The people of the Basses-Alps\r\ngo to Mexico, and the Basques from the French Pyrenees seek\r\nArgentine.[1341] The honesty, industry, and frugality of these mountain\r\nemigrants make them desirable elements in any colonial population, and\r\ninsure their success when they seek their fortunes in the uncrowded\r\nwestern world.\r\n\r\nThe alternative to overpopulation and its remedy emigration is found in\r\npreventive checks to increase. These sometimes take the form of\r\nrestricted or late marriages, as Malthus found to be the case in Norway\r\nand Switzerland in 1799,[1342] before the introduction of steam or\r\nelectric motive power had stimulated the industries of these countries\r\nor facilitated emigration thence. The same end is achieved by the\r\nwidespread religious celibacy which sometimes characterizes mountain\r\ncommunities. In the barren Auvergne Plateau of France, the number of\r\nyounger sons who become priests is extraordinary. Many daughters become\r\nnuns. Celibacy, seconded by extensive emigration, clears the field for\r\nthe eldest son and the system of primogeniture which the poverty of this\r\nrugged highland has established as a fixed institution in the\r\nAuvergne.[1343] A careful statistical investigation of the geographical\r\norigins of the Catholic priesthood in Europe might throw interesting\r\nlight on the influences of environment. The harsh conditions of mountain\r\nlife make the monastery a line of least resistance, while geographical\r\nisolation nourishes the religions nature and benumbs the intellectual\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\nIt is in the corrugated highland of Tibet, chilled to barrenness by an\r\nelevation of 12,000 feet or more (4000 meters), sterile and treeless\r\nfrom aridity, carved by cañon-cutting streams into deep gorges offering\r\na modicum of arable soil for irrigation, that monasticism has developed\r\ninto an effective system to keep down population. Buddhism, with its\r\nconvents and lamaseries, naturally recommended itself to a country where\r\nasceticism was obviously expedient. The world shows nowhere else so\r\nlarge a celibate class. In Tibet, monks are estimated at 175,000 to\r\n500,000 in a total population of three millions. Archibald Little\r\nestimates their number at one-third of the total male population.[1344]\r\nDerge, which is the most productive district both agriculturally and\r\nindustrially of eastern Tibet and is also most densely inhabited, counts\r\nat least 10,000 lamas in a total population of about 42,000.[1345] Not\r\nless than one-sixth of the inhabitants of Ladak are in religious houses\r\nas monks and nuns.[1346] Families in Tibet are small, yet each devotes one\r\nor more children to convent or monastic life.[1347] In western Tibet,\r\nespecially about Taklakot in the Himalayan border, one boy in every\r\nfamily is invariably devoted to the priesthood, and one or more\r\ndaughters must become nuns. But the nun generally resides with her\r\nfamily or lives in some monastery--with unspeakable results.[1348]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Polyandry.]\r\n\r\nThe Tibetans seem to be enthusiastic Malthusians, with all the courage\r\nof their convictions. Religious celibacy among them is only an adjunct\r\nto another equally effective social device for restricting population.\r\nThis is the institution of polyandry, which crops out in widely\r\ndistributed mountain regions of limited resources, just as it appears\r\nnot infrequently in primitive island societies. Its sporadic occurrence\r\nin extensive lowlands, as among the Warraus of Guiana and certain tribes\r\nof the Orinoco, is extremely rare, as also its occasional appearance\r\namong pastoral steppe-dwellers, like the Hottentots and Damaras.[1349] It\r\nis often associated with polygamy where wealth exists, and is never the\r\nexclusive form of marriage, yet its frequency among mountain peoples is\r\nstriking. Strabo describes fraternal polyandry as it existed in\r\nmountainous Yemen. There among a Semitic people, as to-day in Mongolian\r\nTibet and among the aboriginal Todas of the Nilgiri Hills in peninsular\r\nIndia, the staff of one husband left at the door of the house excluded\r\nthe others.[1350] In modern times the institution is found throughout\r\nTibet, and in the Himalayan and sub-Himalayan districts adjoining it, as\r\nin Ladak, Kunawar, Kumaon, Garhwal, Spiti, Sirmur, among the Miris,\r\nDaphlas, Abors and Bhutias occupying the southern slope of the\r\nHimalayans eastward from Sikkim, and the Murmese tribes of the Khasia\r\nHills just to the south. The same practice occurs among the Coorgs of\r\nthe Western Ghats, among the Nairs at the coastal piedmont of this\r\nrange, among the Todas of the mountain stronghold known as the Nilgiri\r\nHills (peaks 8000 feet or 2630 meters), and it crops out sporadically\r\namong certain mountain Bantu tribes of South Africa.[1351]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Female infanticide.]\r\n\r\nThere seems little doubt that polyandry, as Herbert Spencer maintains,\r\nhas been adopted as an obvious and easy check upon increase of\r\npopulation in rugged countries.[1352] It is generally coupled with other\r\npreventive checks. In the Nilgiri Hills, as we found also to be the case\r\non many Polynesian islands, it is closely associated with female\r\ninfanticide.[1353] The Todas in 1867 showed a proportion of two men to\r\none woman, but later, with the decline of infanticide under British\r\nrule, a proportion of 100 men to 75 women, and a resulting modification\r\nof the institution of polyandry.[1354] It may well be that the paucity of\r\nwomen suggested this form of marriage, whose expediency as an ally to\r\ninfanticide in checking population later became apparent. The Todas are\r\na very primitive folk of herdsmen, living on the produce of their\r\nbuffaloes, averse to agriculture, though not inhibited from it by the\r\nnature of their country, therefore prone to seek any escape from that\r\nuncongenial employment,[1355] and relying on the protected isolation of\r\ntheir habitat to compensate for the weakness inherent in the small\r\nnumber of the tribe.\r\n\r\nThroughout Tibet and Ladak polyandry works hand in hand with the\r\nlamaseries in limiting population. The conspicuous fact in Tibetan\r\npolyandry is its restriction to the agricultural portion of the\r\npopulation. The pastoral nomads of the country, depending on their yaks,\r\nsheep and goats, wandering at will over a very wide, if desolate\r\nterritory, practice monogamy and polygamy.[1356] The sedentary\r\npopulation, on the other hand, is restricted to tillable lands so small\r\nthat each farm produces only enough for one family. Subdivision under a\r\ndivided inheritance would be disastrous to these dwarf estates,\r\nespecially owing to possible complications growing out of irrigating\r\nrights.[1357] Polyandry leaves the estate and the family undivided, and\r\nby permitting only one wife to several fraternal husbands restricts the\r\nnumber of children. It does this also in another way by diminishing the\r\nfertility of the mothers; for all travelers comment upon the paucity of\r\nchildren in polyandrous families.\r\n\r\nWestermarck lays stress upon the fact that polyandry prevails chiefly in\r\nsterile countries. He regards it less as a conscious device to check\r\nincrease of population than a result of the disproportion of males to\r\nfemales in polyandrous communities. The preponderance of male births he\r\nattributes to the excessive endogamy bordering on inbreeding which tends\r\nto prevail in all isolated mountain valleys; and also, as a possibility,\r\nto the undernourished condition of the parents caused by scanty food\r\nsupplies, which Düsing found to be productive of a high percentage of\r\nmale births in proportion to female.[1358] The motive of restricting\r\npopulation seems entitled to more weight than Westermarck concedes to\r\nit; for he slurs over the fact that in Tibet polyandry gives rise to a\r\nlarge number of superfluous women who fill the nunneries,[1359] while in\r\nthe Nilgiri Hills redundant females were eliminated by infanticide. The\r\nfact seems to be that in the institution of polyandry we have a social\r\nand psychological effect of environment, reinforced by a physiological\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effects of polyandry and polygamy.]\r\n\r\nA comparison of social conditions in the adjoining provinces of\r\nBaltistan and Ladak, which together comprise the Himalayan valley of the\r\nIndus, reveals the character of polyandry as a response to geographic\r\nenvironment. Both provinces are inhabited by a Mongolian stock, but the\r\nLadaki living on the uppermost stretch of the basin near Tibet are\r\nBuddhists and polyandrists, while the Baltis farther down the valley are\r\nMussulmen and polygamists. The Baltis, with their plurality of wives and\r\nnumerous children, are wretchedly poor and live in squalor on the verge\r\nof starvation; but as the elevation of their valley ranges only from\r\n4000 to 8500 feet, they are inured to heat, and therefore emigrate in\r\nlarge numbers to the neighboring Mohammedan province of the Punjab,\r\nwhere they work as coolies and navvies. The Ladakis, on the other hand,\r\nliving 9000 to 13,000 feet above the sea, die of bilious fever when they\r\nreach the lowlands. Cut off from emigration, they curtail population by\r\nmeans of polyandry and lamaseries. Consequently they show signs of\r\nprosperity, are well fed, well clothed and comfortably housed.[1360]\r\nBaltistan's social condition illustrates in a striking way the power of\r\nan idea like an alien creed, assimilated as the result of close vicinal\r\nlocation, to counteract for a time the influences of local geographic\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marauding tendencies in mountaineers]\r\n\r\nThe less civilized mountain peoples, whose tastes or low economic status\r\nunfit them for emigration, solve the problem of a deficient food supply\r\nby raiding the fields and stores of their richer neighbors. Predatory\r\nexpeditions fill the history of primitive mountain peoples, and of the\r\nancient occupants of highland regions which are now devoted to honest\r\nindustry. The ancient Alpine tribes were one and all, from the\r\nMediterranean to the Danube, \"poor and addicted to robbery,\" as Strabo\r\nsays. He analyzes their condition with nice discrimination. \"The greater\r\npart [of the Alps], especially the summits of the mountains inhabited by\r\nrobbers, are barren and unfruitful, both on account of the frost and the\r\nruggedness of the land. Because of the want of food and other\r\nnecessaries, the mountaineers have sometimes been obliged to spare the\r\ninhabitants of the plains, that they might have some people to supply\r\nthem.\"[1361] The freebooters usually descended into the lowlands of\r\nItaly, Gaul and Helvetia, but the pass peoples lay in wait for their\r\nprey on the mountain roads. Strabo described the same marauding habits\r\narising from the same cause among the mountaineers of northern\r\nSpain,[1362] the Balkan range,[1363] and the highlands encircling the\r\nMesopotamian plains.[1364]\r\n\r\nHunger is usually the spur. The tribesmen who inhabit the Hunza gorge\r\nwere notorious robbers till their recent conquest by the British.\r\nDespite the most careful terrace tillage, their country was much\r\noverpopulated. The supply of grain was so inadequate, that during the\r\nsummer the people subsisted wholly on fruit, reserving the grain for\r\nwinter use. Therefore, when early summer opened the passes of the\r\nKarakorum and Himalayan ranges, and caravans began to move over the\r\ntrade route between Kashmir and Yarkand, when the Kirghis nomads from\r\nthe plains sought the pastures of the Pamir, the Hunza tribesmen found\r\nraiding caravans and herds, and pillaging the Gilgit Valley of Baltistan\r\nthe easiest means of supplementing their slender resources. Hardy\r\nmountaineers as they were, and born fighters, they always conducted\r\ntheir forays successfully, and returned to the shelter of their\r\nfastnesses, laden with plunder and driving their captive flocks before\r\nthem. The perpetual menace of these Hunza raids caused large districts\r\nin the Gilgit Valley to be abandoned by their inhabitants, and\r\ncultivated land to lapse into wilderness,[1365] while the Chilas to the\r\nsouth pillaged the Astor Valley of Baltistan, carrying away crops and\r\ncattle, enslaving women and children.[1366]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cattle-lifting.]\r\n\r\nMarauding propensities are marked among all retarded mountain peoples of\r\nmodern times. The cattle-lifting clans of the Scotch Highlands, who\r\npreyed upon the Lowlands, have their counterpart in the Pathans of the\r\nSuleiman and Baluch mountain border who, till curbed by the British\r\npower in India, systematically pillaged the plains of the Sind.[1367] The\r\nforest Bhils of the Vindhyan and Satpura ranges are scarcely yet married\r\nto agriculture; so when in time of drought their crops fail and the game\r\nabandons the hill forests to seek water in the lowland jungles, the\r\nBhils cheerfully revert to their ancestral habit of cattle-lifting.[1368]\r\n\r\nThe Caucasus was long a breeding place for robber tribes who made their\r\nforays into the pastures and fields of southern Russia. Robbery was part\r\nof the education of every Circassian prince, while one group of the\r\nAbassines conferred their chieftainship upon the most successful robber\r\nor the man of largest family.[1369] The Kurdish hillmen of the Armenian\r\nranges descend with their herds of horses in winter to the warmer\r\nplains, where they exhaust the pastures and subject the Armenian\r\nvillages to a regular system of blackmail.[1370] The wide grassy plains\r\nabout Koukou Nor Lake, near the Chinese border of Tibet, attract\r\nnumerous Mongol nomads with their herds; but these rich pastures are\r\nexposed to the depredation of Si Fan brigand tribes, who have their\r\nhaunts in the deep, impenetrable gorges of the neighboring mountains,\r\nand carefully guard all the approaches to the same. They are Buddhists,\r\nbut worship a special Divinity of Brigandage, to whom their lamas offer\r\nprayers for the success of every foray.[1371] Hence, among mountain as\r\namong desert peoples, robbery tends to become a virtue; environment\r\ndictates their ethical code.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Historical results of mountain raiding.]\r\n\r\nThese depredations reflect to a great degree the complementary relation\r\nof highlands and lowlands. The plains possess what the mountains lack.\r\nThis is a fundamental fact of economic geography, and inevitably leads\r\nto historical results. The marauding expeditions of mountain peoples\r\nfirst acquire historical importance, either when the raids after long\r\ncontinuance end in the conquest of the lowlands, and thus augment the\r\nresources and population of the highland state; or, as is often the\r\ncase, the raiders call down upon themselves the vengeance of the\r\nplainsmen, are subdued, and embodied in the lowland state. The conquest\r\nof ancient Assyria and the destruction of Nineveh by the mountain Medes\r\nseems to have been a process of this kind. Long before their descent\r\nupon Mesopotamia, they were known as the \"dangerous Medes,\" were\r\nconstantly threatening the Assyrian frontiers and occupying isolated\r\ntracts.[1372] The predatory incursions of the Samnites of the Apennines\r\ninto the fertile fields of Campania eventuated in the conquest of\r\nancient Capua and other cities, and greatly strengthened the Samnite\r\nConfederacy. But this encroachment of the mountain tribes upon the\r\nplains aroused the cupidity and alarm of the Romans, who in turn bent\r\ntheir energies toward the final subjugation of the Samnites.[1373]\r\nHimalayan Nepal, after the unification of its petty Rajah states by the\r\nGurkha conquest between 1768 and 1790, began encroachments and ravages\r\nupon the Indian Terai or fertile alluvial lowland at the foot of the\r\nmountains; and finally by 1858 had acquired title to a considerable\r\nstrip of it, which by its rice fields and forests greatly strengthened\r\nthe geographic and economic base of the highland state.[1374] The Malay\r\nHovas, inhabiting the central plateau of Madagascar, braced to effort by\r\nits temperate climate and not over-generous soil, have almost everywhere\r\nsubdued the better fed but sluggish lowlanders of the coast.[1375] There\r\ncan be little doubt that the beneficent effects of an invigorating\r\nmountain climate, especially in tropical and subtropical latitudes, have\r\nhelped the hardy, active hill people to make easy conquest of the\r\nenervated plainsmen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Conquest of mountain regions]\r\n\r\nIt is more often the case, however, that the scant resources, small\r\nnumber, and divided political condition of the mountain tribes make such\r\nconquest impossible. Their depredations provoke reprisals from the\r\nstronger states of the plain, who bring the mountain region under\r\nsubjection, merely to police their frontier. Strabo makes it clear that\r\nthe Romans, having secured certain passes over the Alps, neglected the\r\nconquest of the ranges, till the increase of Roman colonies along the\r\npiedmont rim excited the cupidity of the mountaineers. Muscovite\r\ndominion was extended over the Caucasus, both in order to check the\r\npersistent raids of its tribes into the Russian plains, and to secure\r\ncontrol of its passes. The state of Kashmir, guided by a purely local\r\npolicy, for years tried to conquer the robber tribes on its northwestern\r\nfrontier, merely to protect its own border provinces. Then the British\r\nauthorities of the Indian Empire began the same process, but from a\r\nradically different motive. They saw the Gilgit and Hunza valleys, like\r\nthe Chitral to the west, as highways through a mountain transit land,\r\nwhose opposite approaches were held by the Russians.[1376]\r\n\r\nSuch conquests, whatever be their motive, profit the vanquished in the\r\nend more than the victor. They result in the systematic and intelligent\r\ndevelopment of the mountain resources, and the maintenance of ampler\r\nsocial and economic relations between highland and lowland through the\r\nconstruction of roads, which must always represent the reach of the\r\ngoverning authority. The conquest of mountain peoples means always\r\nexpensive and protracted campaigns. The invader has always two enemies\r\nto fight, Nature and the armed foe. There is a saying in India that \"In\r\nGilgit a small army is annihilated and a large army starves to death.\"\r\nHunger is king in high altitudes, and comes always to the defense of\r\nmountain independence. Moreover, the inaccessibility of such districts,\r\nthe difficulty of maintaining lines of communication, ignorance of\r\nby-paths and trails which forever offer strategic opportunities to the\r\nnatives or escape at a crisis, all serve to protract the war. The\r\nindependent spirit of the mountaineer, his endurance of hardships, his\r\nmastery of mountain tactics, and his obstinate resistance after repeated\r\ndefeat, give always a touch of heroism to highland warfare.\r\nConsequently, history abounds in examples of unconquered mountain\r\npeoples, or of long sustained resistance, like that which for sixty\r\nyears under the heroic leadership of Kadi Mulah and Shamyl used up the\r\ntreasure and troops of Russia in the impregnable defiles of the\r\nCaucasus. In the end, however, the highland tribes succumb to numbers\r\nand the road-making engineer.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Political dismemberment of mountain peoples.]\r\n\r\nPolitical dismemberment, lack of cohesion due to the presence of\r\nphysical barriers impeding intercourse, is the inherent weakness of\r\nmountain peoples. Political consolidation is never voluntary. It is\r\nalways forced upon them from without, either by foreign conquest or by\r\nthe constant menace of such conquest, which compels the mountain clans\r\nto combine for common defense of their freedom. The combination thus\r\nmade is reluctant, loose, easily broken, generally short-lived. It\r\nbecomes close and permanent only under a constant pressure from without,\r\nand then assumes a form allowing to the constituent parts the greatest\r\npossible measure of independence. The Swiss canton and commune are the\r\nresult of a segregating environment; the Swiss Republic is the result of\r\nthreatened encroachments by the surrounding states. It owed its first\r\ngenuine federal constitution to Napoleon.\r\n\r\nA report on the situation in the Caucasus, addressed to Czar Nicholas in\r\n1829, contains an epitome of the history of mountain peoples. It runs as\r\nfollows: \"The Circassians bar out Russia from the south, and may at\r\ntheir pleasure open or close the passage to the nations of Asia. At\r\npresent their intestine dissensions, fostered by Russia, hinder them\r\nfrom uniting under one leader; but it must not be forgotten that,\r\naccording to traditions religiously preserved among them, the sway of\r\ntheir ancestors extended as far as to the Black Sea. * * * The\r\nimagination is appalled at the consequence which their union under one\r\nleader might have for Russia, which has no other bulwark against their\r\nravages than a military line, too extensive to be very strong.\"[1377]\r\nHere we have the whole story--a mountain people pillaging the lowlands,\r\nexercising a dangerous and embarrassing control over the passes, and\r\nthereby calling down upon themselves conquest from without; weakened by\r\na contracting territory within the highlands and a shrinking area of\r\nplunder without, doomed to eventual defeat by the yet more ominous\r\nweakness of political dismemberment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Individualism and independence]\r\n\r\nMountain tribes are always like a pack of hounds on the leash, each\r\nstraining in a different direction. Wall-like barriers, holding them\r\napart for centuries, make them almost incapable of concerted action, and\r\nrestive under any authority but their own. Clan and tribal societies,\r\nfeudal and republican rule, always on a small scale, characterize\r\nmountain sociology. All these are attended by an exaggerated\r\nindividualism and its inevitable concomitant, the blood feud. Mountain\r\npolicy tends to diminish the power of the central authority to the\r\nvanishing point, giving individualism full scope. Social and economic\r\nretardation, caused by extreme isolation and encouraged by protected\r\nlocation, tend to keep the social body small and loosely organized.\r\nEvery aspect of environment makes against social integration.\r\n\r\nThe broken relief of ancient Greece produced the small city state; but\r\nin the rugged mountains of Arcadia the principle of physical and\r\npolitical subdivision went farther. Here, for four centuries after the\r\nfirst Olympiad, the population, poorest and rudest of all Greece, was\r\nsplit up into petty hill villages, each independent of the other.[1378]\r\nThe need of resisting Spartan aggression led for the first time, in 371\r\nB.C., to the formation of a _commune Arcadum_, a coalescence of all the\r\nfractional groups constituting the Arcadian folk;[1379] but even this\r\nunion, effected only by the masterly manipulation of the Theban\r\nEpaminondas, proved short-lived and incomplete. What was true of the\r\nArcadian villages was true of the city states of Greece. The geography\r\nof the land instilled into them the principle of political aloofness,\r\nexcept when menaced by foreign conquest. Cooperation is efficient only\r\nwhen it springs from a habit of mind. Greek union against the Persians\r\nwas very imperfect; and against the Roman, the feeble leagues were\r\nwholly ineffective. The influence of this dismembering environment still\r\npersists. As ancient Greece was a complex of city states, modern Greece\r\nis a complex of separate districts, each of which holds chief place in\r\nthe minds of its citizens, and unconsciously but steadily operates\r\nagainst the growth of a national spirit in the modern sense.[1380]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Types of mountain states.]\r\n\r\nA mountain environment encourages political disunion in several forms.\r\nSometimes it favors the survival of a turbulent feudal nobility, based\r\nupon clan organization, as among the medieval Scotch, who were not less\r\nrebellious toward their own kings than toward the English\r\nconquerors.[1381] Feudal rule seems congenial to the mountaineer, whose\r\nconservative nature, born of isolation, clings to hereditary chiefs and\r\na long established order. Feudal communities and dwarf republics exist\r\nside by side in the northern Caucasus,[1382] attended by that primitive\r\nassertion of individual right, the blood feud.[1383] Often the two forms\r\nof government are combined, but the feudal element is generally only a\r\ndwindling survival from a remote past. The little Republic of Andorra,\r\nwhich for a thousand years has preserved its existence in the protection\r\nof a high Pyrenean valley, is a self-governing community, organized\r\nstrictly along the lines of a Tyrolese or Swiss commune; but the two\r\n_viguiers_ or agents, who in some matters outrank the president, are\r\nofficial appointments tracing back to feudal days, when Andorra was a\r\nseigneurie of the Comté of Urgel.[1384] Tyrol offers a striking parallel\r\nto this. In its local affairs it has in effect a republican form of\r\ngovernment, enjoying as high degree of autonomy as any Swiss canton; but\r\nthe great Brenner route, which could confer both power and wealth on its\r\npossessor, made the Tyrol an object of conquest to the feudal nobles of\r\nthe early Middle Ages. Their hereditary dominion is now vested in the\r\narchdukes of Austria, to whom the Tyrolese have shown unfailing\r\nfidelity, but from whom they have exacted complete recognition of their\r\nrights.[1385]\r\n\r\nTyrol's neighbor Switzerland illustrates the pure form of commune,\r\ncanton and republic, which is the logical result of a rugged mountain\r\nrelief. Here commune and canton are the real units of government. In\r\nthe federal power at Bern the Swiss peasant takes little interest,\r\noften not even knowing the name of the national president. In the\r\nhighest ranges a canton coincides with a mountain-rimmed\r\nvalley--Valais with the basin of the upper Rhone, Glarus with the\r\nupper Linth, Uri with the Reuss, Graubünden with the upper Rhine, to\r\nwhich is joined by many pass routes the sparsely peopled Engadine,\r\nTicino with the drainage basin of upper Lake Maggiore, Unterwalden\r\nwith the southern drainage valleys of Lake Lucerne. Where the\r\nmountains are lower, or where passes connect valleys of high levels,\r\ncantonal boundaries may overstep geographical barriers. A commune\r\ngenerally consists of the villages strung along a narrow lateral\r\nvalley, isolated and sufficient unto itself politically. A close\r\nparallel to the Alpine commune is found among the Kabyles of the Atlas\r\nMountains. Their political structure is based upon the _Jemaa_ or\r\ncommune, a small sovereign republic whose independence is fiercely\r\ndefended. It enjoys complete local autonomy, is governed by an\r\nassembly of all the adult male inhabitants, and grants this body the\r\nusual functions except the administration of justice, which,\r\ncharacteristically, is replaced by blood feuds as the inalienable\r\nright of the individual. Romans, Arabs, Turks and French have in turn\r\nexercised over these mountain Berbers only nominal control, except\r\nwhen their internal dissensions made them vulnerable.[1386]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Significance of their small size.]\r\n\r\nThe mountains, by the segregating power of their ridges and ranges,\r\nfirst produce these little independent communities, and then, throwing\r\naround them strong protecting arms, enfold them in an embrace which long\r\nprovides security to them in their weakness. These minute mountain\r\nstates, therefore, tend to reflect in their size the isolation of their\r\nenvironment, and indirectly the weakness of the surrounding nations. The\r\noriginal Swiss _Eidgenossensschaft_ of the four forest cantons, embedded\r\nin the high Alps, braced against a mountain wall, held its own against\r\nthe feeble feudal states of Austria and Germany. The rugged relief of\r\nGraubünden and the spirit of freedom cradled there enabled its peasants\r\nin the Middle Ages to overthrow the feudal lords, and to establish a\r\nfederal republic. This typical mountain state was a league composed of\r\nthree other leagues. Each component league consisted of a group of\r\ndistricts, having the power of sovereign states, and consisting in turn\r\nof a group of communes, which were quite independent in local affairs.\r\nThis triune league formed in time an alliance with the Swiss\r\nConfederation, but did not become a member of it till the Vienna\r\nadjustment of 1815. Similar is the story of the mountain shepherds of\r\nAppenzell, who formed a little peasant republic, despite their bishop\r\noverlord of St. Gall; and who later during the Reformation, on the\r\nground of religious differences, divided into two yet smaller\r\nstates.[1387] The relation between size and inaccessibility is most\r\nstrikingly illustrated in the high Himalayan ranges west of Kashmir and\r\nnorth of the Punjab. Here is the Shinaka district, which includes the\r\nChilas, Darel, Tanger and other valleys branching off from the Indus,\r\nand which is inhabited by Dards of Indo-European stock. Each Shinaka\r\nvalley is a small cantonal republic, and each village of each republic\r\nis a commune managing its own affairs by an assembly. One settlement of\r\nonly twelve houses enjoys complete autonomy. Besides the village\r\nassemblies there is a state parliament handling questions of general\r\npolicy, to which each village sends representatives. One dissentient\r\nvote can defeat a measure. The majority cannot control the minority; for\r\nif one village of a state disagrees with the others, it is free to carry\r\nout its own policy, even in the matter of foreign alliances.[1388] Here\r\nis home rule run to seed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Slight power of mountain chiefs.]\r\n\r\nSmall size is sometimes coupled with monarchical rule, degenerating\r\noccasionally into despotism among aggressive robber tribes. The\r\ninaccessible Hunza Valley is occupied on opposite sides of its deep\r\ngorge by two rival states, the Hunzas and the Nagaris, whose combined\r\npopulation amounts to scarcely 25,000 souls. Hostile to each other, they\r\nunite only to resist an invading force. While the Hunza Thum is a\r\ntyrant, the Nagari ruler has little voice in the government. The\r\nTibeto-Burman hill folk of the eastern Himalayas are divided into clans,\r\nand concede a mild authority to a chief who rules a group of clan\r\nvillages, but only rarely is able to secure power over a larger\r\ndistrict. The Khasia Hills of Assam are broken up into twenty-three\r\npetty states, each under its own Rajah or chief, who has, however,\r\nlittle authority beyond the administration of justice.[1389]\r\n\r\nEverywhere in mountain regions appears this repugnance to centralized\r\nauthority. Protection by environment obviates the necessity of\r\nprotection through combination. The spirit of clan exclusiveness, the\r\nabsence of a common national sentiment, characterize equally the\r\ntribesmen of mountainous Albania, of Persian Luristan,[1390] and highland\r\nKurdistan. Along the rugged upheaved area which forms the western\r\nboundary of India from the Khaibar Pass to the sea, British officials\r\nhave had to negotiate with the native Pathan and Baluch \"jirgahs,\"\r\nassemblies of the chief men of the countless clans into which the tribes\r\nare divided, as the only visible form of authority tolerated.[1391]\r\nCombination must be voluntary and of a type to exact a modicum of\r\nsubmission. These requirements are best answered by the confederation,\r\nwhich may gradually assume a stable and elaborate form among an\r\nadvanced people like the Swiss; or it may constitute a loose yet\r\neffective union, as in the famous Samnite confederacy of the central\r\nApennines; or a temporary league like that of the ancient Arcadians, or\r\nthe group of confederated sheiks of Bellad el Kobail, the \"Country of\r\nthe Highlanders\" in mountainous Yemen, who in 1790 established a\r\nrepublican form of union for defense against their more powerful\r\nneighbors.[1392]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mountain isolation and differentiation.]\r\n\r\nThe power of mountains to protect makes them asylums of refuge for\r\ndisplaced peoples. This fact explains the confused ethnology which often\r\ncharacterizes these isolated regions, especially when they lie near or\r\nacross natural highways of human migration. As a tide of humanity sweeps\r\naround or across the mountains, a branch stream turns into a side\r\nvalley, where it is caught and held. There it remains unaltered,\r\ncrystallizing in its seclusion, subjected for ages to few modifying\r\ninfluences from without. Its people keep their own language and customs,\r\nlittle affected by a totally different race stock similarly placed in a\r\nneighboring alcove of the mountains. Lack of communication engenders an\r\nendless multiplication of dialects, as we find them in the Alps, the\r\nCaucasus, in Kafirstan of the Hindu Kush and in Nepal. Diversity of\r\nspeech, itself a product of isolation, reacts upon that political and\r\nsocial aloofness of mountain folk, to emphasize and fix it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Survival of primitive races in mountains.]\r\n\r\nFrom this principle it follows that the same highland region shows\r\nstrong differentiation and marked social individuality from one district\r\nto another, and from one valley to the next, despite a prevailing\r\nsimilarity of local geographic conditions. In fact, the very similarity\r\nof those conditions, strong in their power to isolate, present the\r\nconditions for inevitable variation. A mountain region gets its\r\npopulation from diverse sources, or, which is quite as important, at\r\ndifferent times from the same source. For instance, Nepal received\r\ncontingents of Rajput conquerors, dislodged from the Punjab, in the\r\nseventh century, the eleventh, and finally the dominant Gurkhas at the\r\nend of the eighteenth. To-day these represent different degrees of\r\namalgamation with the local Tibetan stock of Nepal. They are\r\ndistinguished from each other by a diversity of languages, and a\r\nmultiplicity of dialects, while the whole piedmont of the country shows\r\na yet different blend with the Aryan Hindus of the Ganges valley, who\r\nhave seeped into the Terai and been drawn up, as if by capillary\r\nattraction, into the hill valleys of the outer range. The Vindhyan Range\r\nand its associated highlands, long before the dawn of Indian history,\r\ncaught and held in their careful embrace some of the fragile aboriginal\r\ntribes like the Kolarian Ho, Santals and Korkus. Centuries later the\r\nDravidian Bhils and Gonds sought refuge here before the advancing\r\nIndo-Aryans, and found asylums in the secluded valleys.[1393] Finally\r\nthose same northern plains whence the Dravidians had come, after the\r\nMohammedan conquest of central India in the sixteenth century, sent\r\nflying to the refuge of the hills a large contingent of Hindus of\r\nmingled Dravidian and Aryan stocks, but stamped with the culture of the\r\nGanges basin. These occupied the richer valleys and the more accessible\r\nplateaus of the highlands, driving the primitive Gonds and Bhils back\r\ninto the remoter recesses of the mountains.[1394] Dravidians and\r\naboriginal Kolarians survive in their purity in the wilder and more\r\ninaccessible regions, but in the lower valleys their upper classes show\r\nsigns of mixtures with the Rajput invaders, while the lower classes\r\nbetray little Aryan blood.[1395]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Diversity of peoples and dialects.]\r\n\r\nAfghanistan, of disordered relief, set as a transit region between the\r\nplains of Mesopotamia, the Oxus and the Indus, has a confused ethnology\r\nin keeping with the tangle of dissected plateaus and mountain systems\r\nwhich constitute its surface. Here we find three distinct branches of\r\nthe Indo-European race, divided up into various peoples of diverse\r\ntongues and subdivided further into countless tribes; and two branches\r\nof Mongol-Tartars scattered, as if out of a pepper box, from the Helmund\r\nto the Oxus, tossed in among diverse peoples of Iranic and Galcha origin\r\nin hopeless confusion. The various Afghan tribes, separated from each\r\nother by natural barriers and intervening alien stocks, though similar\r\nin physical type, speech, religion and culture, have no sense of unity,\r\nno common political aims, while the appalling list of tribes\r\nconstituting the population of the country[1396] offers little hope of\r\nAfghanistan ever developing national cohesion. Kafiristan alone, which\r\nlies in the Hindu Kush range for the most part at an altitude of 12,000\r\nfeet or more, harbors in its recesses many remnants of primitive\r\npeoples, speaking various languages and dialects, strangers alike to any\r\nnative affinity or political union. It is a mere agglomeration of ethnic\r\nfragments, in which the people of one village are often unable to\r\nconverse with those of the next.[1397] Relief has fashioned the ethnology\r\nof the Caucasus in the same way. No other equally small area in the\r\nworld contains such a variety of peoples and tongues, differing from one\r\nanother in race, language, and customs so fundamentally as the Caucasus.\r\nFrom the heterogeneous survivals of extremely old ethnic stocks, lodged\r\nin the high valleys, to the intrusive Russians of the lower piedmont,\r\nthe Caucasus might be called an ethnographical sample card.[1398]\r\n\r\nThe rugged configuration of the Alps, from the Rhone to the Danube, has\r\npreserved the broad-headed Alpine race, which was perhaps the primitive\r\nstock of Central Europe. The great river valleys leading into this\r\nmassive highland, like the Rhine, Aar, Inn and Adige, show the intrusion\r\nof a long-headed race from both north and south; but lofty and remote\r\nvalleys off the main routes of travel, like the Hither Rhine about\r\nDissentis, the little Stanzerthal of the upper Inn, and the Passierthal\r\nof the upper Adige above Meran, show the race preserved in its purity by\r\nthe isolating environment.[1399] Here each segregated lateral valley\r\nbecomes an area of marked linguistic and social differentiation; only\r\nwhere it opens into the wider longitudinal valleys are its peculiarities\r\nof speech and custom diluted by the intrusive current of another race.\r\nSwitzerland has received three different streams of language, and broken\r\nthem up into numerous rivulets of dialect. On its small area of 16,125\r\nsquare miles (41,346 square kilometers) thirty-five dialects of German\r\nare spoken, sixteen of French, eight of Italian and five of Romansch, a\r\nprimitive and degenerate Latin tongue, surviving from the ancestral days\r\nof Roman occupation.[1400] The yet smaller territory of the Tyrol has all\r\nthese languages except French, whose place is taken by various forms of\r\nSlavonic speech, which have entered by the western tributaries of the\r\nDanube.[1401]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Constriction of mountain areas of ethnic survivals.]\r\n\r\nRarely is a polyglot mountain population able to work out its own\r\npolitical salvation, as the Swiss have done. More often political union\r\nmust be forced upon them from without. Oftener still, when the\r\nhighlanders are primitive survivals, ill-matched against the superior\r\ninvaders from the plain, they are doomed to a process of constriction of\r\nterritory and deterioration of numbers, which proceeds slowly or rapidly\r\naccording to the inaccessibility of their environment and the energy of\r\nthe intruders. Deliberate, unenterprising nations, like the Chinese,\r\nTurks and Indo-Aryans long tolerate the presence of alien mountain\r\ntribes, who remain like enemies brought to bay in their isolated\r\nfortresses. The conquerors throw around them at their leisure a cordon\r\nof settlement, which, slowly ascending the piedmont, draws closer and\r\ncloser about the mountaineers. The situation of many mountain tribes\r\nreminds one of a besieged stronghold. Russian wars against the Caucasus\r\nhave rightly been described as protracted sieges. The heroic history of\r\nSwitzerland in relation to its neighbors has been that of a skillfully\r\nconducted defense, both military and diplomatic. The territory of China\r\nis dotted over with detached groups of aborigines, who have survived\r\nwherever a friendly mountain has offered them an asylum. Variously known\r\nas Lolos, Mantze or Miaotse, they have preserved everywhere a\r\nsemi-independence in pathless mountains, whither Chinese troops do not\r\ndare to follow them;[1402] but the more numerous and patient Chinese\r\nagriculturalists are in many sections slowly encroaching upon their\r\nterritories, driving them farther and farther into the recesses of their\r\nhighlands. The same process goes on in Formosa, where the Chinese have\r\ngradually forced the native Malays into mountain fastnesses among the\r\npeaks which rise to 14,000 feet (4500 meters). There, split up by\r\ninternecine feuds into numberless clans and tribes, ignorant of one\r\nanother's languages, raiding each other's territories and the coastal\r\nplains tilled by Chinese colonists, they await their doom, while the\r\npiedmont zone between has already given birth to a typical border race\r\nof halfbreeds, more Chinese than Malay.[1403]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Isolation and retardation of mountain regions.]\r\n\r\n\"To have and to hold\" is the motto of the mountains. Like remote\r\nislands, they are often museums of social antiquities. Antiquated races\r\nand languages abound. The mountaineers of the Southern Appalachians\r\nspeak to-day an eighteenth century English. Their literature is the\r\nballad poetry of old England and Scotland, handed down from parent to\r\nchild. Clan feuds settle questions of justice, as in the Caucasus and\r\nthe Apennines. Religion is orthodox to the last degree, sectarianism is\r\nrigid, and Joshua's power over the sun remains in some lonely valleys\r\nundiscounted.[1404] These are all the marks of isolation and retardation\r\nwhich appear in similar environments elsewhere. Especially religious\r\ndogmas tend to show in mountains a tenacity of life impossible in the\r\nplains. The Kafirs, inhabiting the high Hindu Kush Mountains of\r\nBadakshan, and apparently of Pelasgic, early Greek, or Persian origin,\r\nhave a religion blended of paganism, Zoroastrianism and Brahmanism.[1405]\r\nOne intruding faith has been unable to dislodge the previous incumbent,\r\nso the three have combined. The great historical destiny of the small,\r\nbarren, isolated Judean plateau was to hold aloof the chaste religion of\r\nthe desert-bred Jews from the sensuous agricultural gods of the\r\nCanaanites; to conserve and fix it; if need be, to narrow it to a\r\nprovincial tribal faith, to stamp it with exclusiveness, conservatism,\r\nand formalism, as its adherents with bigotry,[1406] for this is always\r\nthe effect of geographical seclusion. But when all these limitations of\r\nJudaism are acknowledged, the fact remains that that segregated mountain\r\nenvironment performed the inestimable service for the world of keeping\r\npure and undefiled the first and last great gift of the desert, a\r\nmonotheistic faith.\r\n\r\nBuddhism, once the official religion of Korea but disestablished three\r\ncenturies ago, has taken refuge in the Diamond Mountains, far from the\r\nmain roads; there a dull, moribund form of the faith dozes on in the\r\nmonasteries and monastic shrines of these secluded highlands.[1407]\r\nDriven out of India, Buddhism survives only in the Himalayan border of\r\nthe country among the local Tibeto-Burman peoples, and in Ceylon, whose\r\nmountain city of Kandy is its stronghold. The persecuted Waldenses, a\r\nheretic sect who fled in 1178 from the cities of France to the Alps,\r\ntook refuge in the remote valleys of the Pellice, Chisone, and Augrogne\r\nsome thirty miles southwest of Turin. There, protected equally against\r\nattack and modification, the Waldenses have maintained the old tenets\r\nand organization of their religion.[1408]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Conservatism of mountain peoples.]\r\n\r\nThe mountain-dweller is essentially conservative. There is little in his\r\nenvironment to stimulate him to change, and little reaches him from the\r\noutside world. The \"spirit of the times\" is generally the spirit of a\r\npast time, when it has penetrated to his remote upland. He is strangely\r\nindifferent to what goes on in the great outstretched plains below him.\r\nWhat filters in to him from the outside has little suggestion for him,\r\nbecause it does not accord with the established order which he has\r\nalways known. Hence innovation is distasteful to him. This repugnance to\r\nchange reaches its clearest expression, perhaps, in the development and\r\npreservation of national costumes. _Tracht,_ which is crystallized style\r\nin dress, appears nowhere so widespread and so abundantly differentiated\r\nas in mountain districts. In Switzerland, every canton has its\r\ndistinctive costume which has come down from a remote past. The peasants\r\nof Norway, of the German and Austrian Alps, of the Basque settlements in\r\nthe Pyrenees, of mountain-bound Alsace and Bohemia, give local color to\r\nthe landscape by the picturesqueness of their national dress.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mental and moral qualities.]\r\n\r\nWith this conservatism of the mountaineer is generally coupled suspicion\r\ntoward strangers, extreme sensitiveness to criticism, superstition,\r\nstrong religious feeling, and an intense love of home and family. The\r\nbitter struggle for existence makes him industrious, frugal, provident;\r\nand, when the marauding stage has been outgrown, he is peculiarly honest\r\nas a rule. Statistics of crime in mountain regions show few crimes\r\nagainst property though many against person. When the mountain-bred man\r\ncomes down into the plains, he brings with him therefore certain\r\nqualities which make him a formidable competitor in the struggle for\r\nexistence,--the strong muscles, unjaded nerves, iron purpose, and\r\nindifference to luxury bred in him by the hard conditions of his native\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n[1253] Heinrich von Treitschke, _Politik,_ Vol. I, p. 218.

It is a factor in most\r\nphysiological and psychological effects of environment. It underlies the\r\nwhole significance of zonal location, continental and insular. Large\r\nterritorial areas are favorable to improved variation in men and animals\r\npartly because they comprise a diversity of natural conditions, of which\r\na wide range of climates forms one. This is also one advantage of a\r\nvaried relief, especially in the Tropics, where all the zones may be\r\ncompressed into a small area on the slopes of high mountains like the\r\nAndes and Kilimanjaro. Climate fixes the boundaries of human habitation\r\nin Arctic latitudes and high altitudes by drawing the dead-line to all\r\norganic life. It dominates life in steppes and torrid deserts as in\r\nsub-polar wastes. It encourages intimacy with the sea in tropical Malays\r\nand Polynesians, and like a slave-driver, scourges on the fur-clad\r\nEskimo to reap the harvest of the deep. It is always present in that\r\nintricate balance of geographic factors which produces a given\r\nhistorical result, throwing its weight now into one side of the scales,\r\nnow into the other. It underlies the production, distribution and\r\nexchange of commodities derived from the vegetable and animal kingdoms,\r\ninfluences methods of agriculture, and the efficiency of human labor in\r\nvarious industries.[1409] Hence it is a potent factor in the beginning and\r\nin the evolution of civilization, so far as this goes hand in hand with\r\neconomic development.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Climate in the interplay of geographic factors.]\r\n\r\nThe foregoing chapters have therefore been indirectly concerned with\r\nclimate to no small degree, but they have endeavored to treat the\r\nsubject analytically, showing climate as working with or against or in\r\nsome combination with other geographic factors. This course was\r\nnecessary, because climatic influences are so conspicuous and so\r\nimportant that by the older geographers like Montesquieu[1410] and others,\r\nthey have been erected into a blanket theory, and made to explain a wide\r\nrange of social and historical phenomena which were properly the effect\r\nof other geographic factors.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Direct and indirect effects of climate.]\r\n\r\nFor a clear understanding of climatic influences, it is necessary to\r\nadhere to the chief characteristics of the atmosphere, such as heat and\r\ncold, moisture and aridity, and to consider the effect of zonal\r\nlocation, winds and relief in the production and distribution of these;\r\nalso to distinguish between direct and indirect results of climate,\r\ntemporary and permanent, physiological and psychological ones, because\r\nthe confusion of these various effects breeds far-fetched conclusions.\r\nThe direct modification of man by climate is partly an _a priori_\r\nassumption, because the incontestable evidences of such modification\r\nare not very numerous, however strong the probability may be. The\r\neffect of climate upon plant and animal life is obvious, and immediately\r\nraises the assumption that man has been similarly influenced. But there\r\nis this difference: in contrast to the helpless dependence upon\r\nenvironment of stationary plants and animals, whose range of movement is\r\nstrictly determined by conditions of food and temperature, the great\r\nmobility of man, combined with his inventiveness, enables him to flee or\r\nseek almost any climatic condition, and to emancipate himself from the\r\nfull tyranny of climatic control by substituting an indirect economic\r\neffect for a direct physical effect.\r\n\r\nThe direct results of climate are various, though some are open to the\r\ncharge of imperfect proof. Even the relation of nigrescence to tropical\r\nheat, which seems to be established by the geographical distribution of\r\nnegroid races in the Old World, fails to find support from the facts of\r\npigmentation among the American Indians from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego.\r\nNevertheless climate undoubtedly modifies many physiological processes\r\nin individuals and peoples,[1411] affects their immunity from certain\r\nclasses of diseases and their susceptibility to others, influences their\r\ntemperament, their energy, their capacity for sustained or for merely\r\nintermittent effort, and therefore helps determine their efficiency as\r\neconomic and political agents.\r\n\r\nWhile producing these direct effects, climate also influences man\r\nindirectly by controlling the wide range of his life conditions\r\ndependent upon the plant and animal life about him. It dictates what\r\ncrops he may raise, and has it in its power to affect radically the size\r\nof his harvest. It decides which flocks and herds are best suited to his\r\nenvironment, and therefore directs his pastoral activities, whether he\r\nkeeps reindeer, camels, llamas, horses or horned cattle. By interdicting\r\nboth agriculture and stock-raising, as in Greenland whose ice cap leaves\r\nlittle surface free even for reindeer moss, it condemns the inhabitants\r\nforever to the uncertain subsistence of the hunter. Where it encourages\r\nthe growth of large forests which harbor abundant game and yield\r\nabundant fruits, as in the hot, moist equatorial belt and on rainy\r\nmountain slopes, it prolongs the hunter stage of development, retards\r\nthe advance to agriculture. Climate thus helps to influence the rate and\r\nthe limit of cultural development. It determines in part the local\r\nsupply of raw material with which man has to work, and hence the\r\nmajority of his secondary activities, except where these are expended on\r\nmineral resources. It decides the character of his food, clothing, and\r\ndwelling, and ultimately of his civilization.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effect of climate upon relief.]\r\n\r\nThe very ground under man's feet, moreover, feels the molding hand of\r\nclimate. In one region a former age of excessive cold has glaciated the\r\nsurface and scoured off the fertile loam down to the underlying rock, or\r\nleft the land coated with barren glacial drift or more productive clays.\r\nIn another, the cold still persists and caps the land with ice and snow,\r\nor, as in the tundra, underlays it with a stratum of frozen earth, which\r\nkeeps the surface wet and chilled even in the height of summer. In yet\r\nother regions, abundant moisture combined with heat covers the ground\r\nwith a pad of fertile humus, while some hundred miles away drying trade\r\nwinds parch and crack the steppe vegetation, convert most of its organic\r\nsubstance into gases, and leave only a small residue to enrich the soil.\r\nRain itself modifies the relief of the land, and therefore often decides\r\nin a slow, cosmic way what shall be the ultimate destination of its\r\nprecious store of water. A heavy precipitation on the windward side of a\r\nmountain range, by increasing the mechanical force of its drainage\r\nstreams, makes them bite their way back into the heart of the system and\r\ndecapitate the rivers on the leeward side, thus diminishing the volume\r\nof water left to irrigate the rainless slope. Thus the hydra-headed\r\nAmazon has been spreading and multiplying its sources among the Andean\r\nvalleys, to the detriment of agriculture on the dry Pacific slope; thus\r\nthe torrents of the Western Ghats, gorged by the monsoon rains from the\r\nIndian Ocean, are slowly nipping off the streams of the ill-watered\r\nDeccan, [See map page 484.] All these direct and indirect effects of\r\nclimate may combine to produce ultimate politico-geographical results\r\nwhich manifest themselves in the expansion, power and permanence of\r\nstates.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Climate limits the habitable area.]\r\n\r\nClimatic conditions limit the habitable area of the earth. This is\r\ntheir most important anthropo-geographic effect. At either pole lurks an\r\ninvincible foe, with whom expanding humanity must always reckon, and who\r\nbrooks little encroachment upon his territory. His weapon is the\r\nrestriction of organic life, without which man cannot exist. The\r\ngeographical boundaries of organic life, however, are wider than those\r\nof human life. The consequence of this climatic control, therefore, is\r\nnot only a narrowed distribution of the human race, but a concentration\r\nwhich intensifies the struggle for existence, forces the utilization of\r\nall the available area, and thereby in every locality stimulates\r\nadaptation to environment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Adaptability of man to climatic extremes.]\r\n\r\nMan ranks among the most adaptable organic beings on the earth. No\r\nclimate is absolutely intolerable to him. Only the absence of food\r\nsupply or of all marketable commodities will exclude him from the most\r\ninhospitable region. His dwellings are found from sea level up to an\r\naltitude of 5000 meters or more, where the air pressure is little over\r\none half that on the coast.[1412] Seventeen per cent. of the towns and\r\ncities of Bolivia are located at an elevation above 13,000 feet (4000\r\nmeters), while Aullagas occupies a site 15,700 feet or nearly 5000\r\nmeters above the sea.[1413] Mineral wealth explains these high Bolivian\r\nsettlements, just as it draws the Mexican sulphur miners to temporary\r\nresidence in the crater of Popocatepetl at an altitude of 17,787 feet\r\n(5420 meters), from their permanent dwellings a thousand meters\r\nbelow.[1414] The laborers employed in the construction of the Oroya\r\nrailroad in Peru became rapidly accustomed to work in the rarefied air\r\nat an elevation of 4000 to 4800 meters. The trade routes over the Andes\r\nand Himalayan ranges often cross passes at similar altitudes; the\r\nKarakorum road mounts to 18,548 feet (5,650 meters). Yet these great\r\nelevations do not prevent men going their way and doing the day's work,\r\nalthough the unacclimated tenderfoot is liable to attacks of mountain\r\nsickness in consequence of the rarefied air.[1415]\r\n\r\nMan makes himself at home in any zone. The cold pole of the earth, so\r\nfar as recorded temperatures show, is the town of Verkhoyansk in\r\nnortheastern Siberia, whose mean January temperature is 54 F. below zero\r\n(-48 Centigrade). Massawa, one of the hottest spots in the furnace of\r\nAfrica is the capital of the Italian colony of Eritrea. However,\r\nextremes both of heat and cold reduce the density of population, the\r\nscale and efficiency of economic enterprises. The greatest events of\r\nuniversal history and especially the greatest historical developments\r\nbelong to the North Temperate Zone. The decisive voyages of discovery\r\nemanated thence, though the needs of trade and the steady winds of low\r\nlatitudes combined to carry them to the Tropics. The coldest lands of\r\nthe earth are either uninhabited, like Spitzenbergen, or sparsely\r\npopulated, like northern Siberia. The hottest regions, also, are far\r\nfrom being so densely populated as many temperate countries.[1416] [See\r\nmaps pages 8, 9, and 612.] The fact that they are for the most part\r\ndependencies or former colonial possessions of European powers indicates\r\ntheir retarded economic and political development. The contrast between\r\nthe Mongol Tunguse, who lead the life of hunters and herders in Arctic\r\nSiberia, and the related Manchus, who conquered and rule the temperate\r\nlands of China, shows how climates help differentiate various branches\r\nof the same ethnic stock; and this contrast only parallels that between\r\nthe Eskimo and Aztec offshoots of the American Indians, the Norwegian\r\nand Italian divisions of the white race.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MEAN ANNUAL ISOTHERMS AND HEAT BELTS [_Centigrade_]\r\n0°C = 32°F. 20°C = 68°F. 30°C = 86°F.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Temperature as modified by oceans and winds.]\r\n\r\nThe zonal location of a country indicates roughly the degree of heat\r\nwhich it receives from the sun. It would do this accurately if\r\nvariations of relief, prevailing winds and proximity of the oceans did\r\nnot enter as disturbing factors. Since water heats and cools more slowly\r\nthan the land, the ocean is a great reservoir of warmth in winter and of\r\ncold in summer, and exercises therefore an equalizing effect upon the\r\ntemperature of the adjacent continents, far as these effects can be\r\ncarried by the wind. The ocean is also the great source of moisture, and\r\nthis, too, it distributes over the land through the agency of the wind.\r\nWhere warm ocean currents, like the Gulf Stream and Kuro Siwa, penetrate\r\ninto temperate or sub-polar latitudes, or where cool ones, like the\r\nPeruvian and Benguela Currents wash the coasts of tropical regions, they\r\nenhance the power of the ocean and wind to mitigate the extremes of\r\ntemperature on land. The warm currents, moreover, loading the air above\r\nthem with vapor, provide a store of rain to the nearest wind-swept\r\nland. Hence both the rainfall and temperature of a given country depend\r\nlargely upon its neighboring water and air currents, and its\r\naccessibility to the rain-bearing winds. If it occupies a marked\r\ncentral position in temperate latitudes, like eastern Russia or the\r\nGreat Plains of our semi-arid West, it receives limited moisture and\r\nsuffers the extreme temperatures of a typical continental climate. The\r\nsame result follows if it holds a distinctly peripheral location, and\r\nyet lies in the rain-shadow of a mountain barrier, like western Peru,\r\nPatagonia and Sweden north of the sixtieth parallel. [See map page 484.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effect of the westerlies.]\r\n\r\nOwing to the prevalence of westerly winds in the Temperate Zones and\r\nparticularly in the North Temperate Zone, the mean annual temperature is\r\nhigh on the western face of the northern continents, but drops rapidly\r\ntoward the east.[1417] This is especially true of winter temperatures,\r\nwhich even near the eastern coast show the severity of a continental\r\nclimate. Sitka and New York, Trondhjem and Peking have the same mean\r\nJanuary temperatures, though Peking lies in about the latitude of\r\nMadrid, over twenty-three degrees farther south.\r\n\r\nEurope's location in the path of the North Atlantic westerlies, swept by\r\nwinds from a small and narrow ocean which has been super-heated by the\r\npowerful Gulf Stream, secures for that continent a more equable climate\r\nand milder winters than corresponding latitudes on the western coasts of\r\nNorth America, whose winds from the wide Pacific are not so warm.[1418]\r\nMoreover, a coastal rampart of mountains from Alaska to Mexico restricts\r\nthe beneficial influences of the Pacific climate to a narrow seaboard,\r\nexcludes them from the vast interior, which by reason of cold or aridity\r\nor both must forever renounce great economic or historical significance,\r\nunless its mineral resources developed unsuspected importance. In\r\nEurope, the absence of mountain barriers across the course of these\r\nwesterly winds from Norway to central Spain, and the unobstructed avenue\r\noffered to them by the Mediterranean Sea during fall and winter, enable\r\nall the Atlantic's mitigating influences of warmth and moisture to\r\npenetrate inland, and temper the climate of Europe as far east as St.\r\nPetersburg and Constantinople. Thus several factors have combined to\r\ngive the western half of Europe an extraordinarily favorable climate.\r\nThey have therefore greatly broadened its zone of historical intensity\r\ntoward the north, pushed it up to the sixtieth parallel, while the\r\ncorresponding zone in eastern Asia finds its northern limit at the\r\nfortieth degree.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rainfall.]\r\n\r\nMoisture and warmth are essential to all that life upon which human\r\nexistence depends. Hence temperature and rainfall are together the most\r\nimportant natural assets of a country, because of their influence upon\r\nits productivity. The grazing capacity and wheat yield of southern\r\nAustralia increase almost regularly with every added inch of\r\nrainfall.[1419] The map of population for the Empire of India clearly\r\nshows that a high degree of density accompanies a high and certain\r\nrainfall. Exceptions occur only where hilly or mountainous tracts offer\r\nscant arable areas, or where plains and valleys are sparsely populated\r\nowing to political troubles or unhealthiness. Nearly three-tenths of the\r\npopulation are found crowded together on the one-tenth of India's level\r\nterritory which is blessed with a rainfall above the average for the\r\ncountry.[1420] Deserts which yield nothing are purely climatic phenomena.\r\nSteppes which facilitate the historical movement, and forests which\r\nblock it, are products of scant or ample precipitation. The zonal\r\ndistribution of rainfall, with its maxima in the Tropics and the\r\nTemperate Zones, and its minima in the trade-wind belts and polar\r\nregions, reinforces and emphasizes the influence of temperature in\r\ndetermining certain great cultural and economic zones.\r\n\r\nIn equatorial regions, which have an abundant rainfall throughout the\r\nyear, agriculture is directed toward fruits and roots; only in certain\r\ndistricts can it include cereals, and then only rice and maize. The\r\ntemperate grains demand some dry summer weeks for their maturity.\r\nExcessive moisture in Ireland has practically excluded wheat-growing,\r\nwhich in England and Scotland also is restricted chiefly to the drier\r\neastern counties.[1421] It thrives, on the other hand, in Manitoba and the\r\nRed River region even with a short season of scant rainfall, because\r\nthis comes in the spring when moisture is most needed.[1422] Most\r\nimportant to man, therefore, is the question how and when the rainfall\r\nis distributed, and with what regularity it comes. Monsoon and\r\ntrade-wind districts labor under the disadvantage of a wet and dry\r\nseason, and a variability which brings tragic results, since it easily\r\nreduces a barely adequate rainfall to disastrous drought. These are the\r\nlands where wind and weather lord it over man. If the rains hold off too\r\nlong, or stop too soon, or withhold even a small portion of their\r\naccustomed gift, famine stalks abroad.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Temperature and zonal location.]\r\n\r\nTemperature, the other important element of climate, depends primarily\r\nupon zonal location, which has far different historical results from\r\ncentral and peripheral location, continental and insular. It determines\r\nthe amount of heat received from the sun, though air and ocean currents\r\nmay redistribute that heat within certain limits, and humidity or\r\naridity modify its effects. Still zonal distinctions remain. The great\r\nclimatic regions of the earth, like the hot, wet equatorial belt or the\r\nwarm, dry trade-wind belts or the cool, well-watered temperate zones,\r\nconstitute, through the medium of their economic products and their\r\nclimatically imposed methods of production, so many socio-political\r\nareas, regardless of ethnic and political boundaries. The Berber nomads\r\nof the northern Sahara live much as the Semitic Bedouins of the Syrian\r\ndesert or the Turkoman stock of arid Turkestan. They have the same\r\ntribal government, the same scattered distribution in small groups, the\r\nsame economic basis of subsistence, though of different races and\r\ndominated respectively by France, Turkey and Russia. The history of the\r\ntropical Antilles has in both its economic and political features\r\nparalleled that of the East Indies since the early 16th century.\r\nTemperate South America promises to follow in the historical footsteps\r\nof temperate North America, South Africa in those of Europe and\r\ntemperate Australia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reactions of contrasted zones.]\r\n\r\nWhile people of the same latitude live approximately under the same\r\ntemperature conditions, those of contrasted zones are subjected to\r\nmarkedly different influences. They develop different degrees of\r\ncivilization, wealth, economic efficiency, and density of population;\r\nhence they give rise to great historical movements in the form of\r\nmigration, conquest, colonization, and commerce, which, like convection\r\ncurrents, seek to equalize the differences and reach an equilibrium.\r\nNature has fixed the mutual destiny of tropical and temperate zones, for\r\ninstance, as complementary trade regions. The hot belt produces numerous\r\nthings that can never grow in colder countries, while a much shorter\r\nlist of products, coupled, however, with greater industrial efficiency,\r\nis restricted to the Temperate Zone. This explains the enormous\r\nimportance of the East Indian trade for Europe in ancient and medieval\r\ntimes, the value of tropical possessions for commercial countries like\r\nEngland and Holland. It throws light upon the persistence of the\r\ntropical plantation system in the Dutch East Indies and republican\r\nMexico, as formerly in the sugar and cotton fields of the Southern\r\nStates, with its relentless grip upon the throat of national life in hot\r\nlands.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Temperate products from tropical highlands.]\r\n\r\nTropical regions, however, may profit by the fact that their mountains\r\nand plateaus permit the cultivation of temperate crops. India during the\r\nlast century has introduced tea culture extensively on the Assam and\r\nNilgiri Hills, and in the Himalayan valleys up to an altitude of 7000\r\nfeet.[1423] Besides this temperate product, it has put large areas into\r\ncotton, chiefly in the peninsular plateau of the Deccan, and by means of\r\nthese two crops has caused a considerable readjustment in world\r\ncommerce.[1424] Nevertheless, here the infringement of the principle of\r\ntropical production in the torrid zone is after all slight. In tropical\r\nAmerica, on the other hand, the case is quite different; this region\r\npresents an interesting paradox in relation to its foreign commerce.\r\nHere the highlands are the chief seats of population. They contain,\r\nmoreover, the most industrious and intelligent native stock, due to\r\ngeographical and historical causes running back into the ancient\r\ncivilizations, as well as the largest proportions of immigrant\r\nEuropeans. This is true not only of the Cordilleran states from northern\r\nMexico to the borders of Chile, but also of Brazil, whose center of\r\npopulation falls on the plateau behind Rio de Janeiro and Santos. The\r\nisolation of these high plateaus excludes them to a serious extent from\r\nforeign trade, while their great altitude permits only temperate\r\nproducts, with the exception of sub-tropical coffee, which is their only\r\ncrop meeting a great demand. The world wants, on the other hand, the\r\nlong list of lowland tropical exports which torrid America furnishes as\r\nyet in inadequate amounts, owing to the lack of an industrious and\r\nabundant lowland population. Commerce will eventually experience a\r\nreadjustment in these localities to the natural basis of tropical\r\nproduction; but how soon or how effectively this change will take place\r\ndepends upon the question of immigration of foreign tropical peoples, or\r\nthe more difficult problem of white acclimatization.[1425]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Isothermal lines in anthropo-geography.]\r\n\r\nDespite some purely climatological objections, anthropo-geography finds\r\nthe division of climatic zones according to certain isothermal lines of\r\nmean annual temperature the most expedient one for its purpose. The hot\r\nzone may be taken as the belt north and south of the equator enclosed\r\nbetween the annual isotherms of 20° C. (68° F.) These hold a course\r\ngenerally far outside the two tropics, and in the northern continents\r\nfrequently reach the thirty-fifth parallel. The temperate climatic zones\r\nextend from the annual isotherm of 20° C. to that of 0° C. (32° F.),\r\nwhich bears little relation to the polar circles forming the limits of\r\nthe solar Temperate Zone. The north temperate climatic zone has been\r\nfurther sub-divided along the annual isotherm of 5° C. (41° F.),\r\ndistinguishing thus the warmer southern belt, which forms preëminently\r\nthe zone of greatest historical intensity. The areas beyond the annual\r\nisotherms of 0°C. belong to the barren cold zones. [See map page 612.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Historical effect of compressed isotherms.]\r\n\r\nThis isothermal division of the climatic zones is abundantly justified,\r\nbecause the duration of a given degree of heat or cold in any region is\r\na dominant factor in its human, animal, and plant life. A map of the\r\nmean annual isotherms of the earth is therefore eloquent of the relation\r\nbetween historical development and this one phase of climate. Where the\r\nlines run far apart, they enclose extensive areas of similar\r\ntemperature; and where they approach, they group together regions of\r\ncontrasted temperatures. The compression of climatic differences into a\r\nsmall area enlivens and accentuates the process of historical\r\ndevelopment. It produces the same sort of effect as the proximity of\r\ncontrasted reliefs. Nowhere else in the world do the tropical and\r\nfrigid climatic areas, as defined on the north and south by the annual\r\nisothermal lines of 20°C. and 0°C. respectively, lie so near together as\r\nin Labrador and northern Florida. Separated here by only twenty degrees\r\nof latitude, on the opposite side of the Atlantic they diverge so\r\nsharply as to include the whole western face of Europe, from Hammerfest\r\nand the North Cape down to the Canary Islands and the crest of the Atlas\r\nMountains in Africa, a stretch of forty-two degrees of latitude. This\r\napproximation of contrasted climatic districts in North America was an\r\nimmense force in stimulating the early economic development of the\r\nThirteen Colonies, and in maturing them to the point of political\r\nautonomy. It gave New England commerce command of a nearby tropical\r\ntrade in the West Indies, of sub-tropical products in the southern\r\ncolonies, in close proximity to all the contrasted products of a cold\r\nclimate--dense northern forests for naval stores and lumber, and an\r\ninexhaustible supply of fish from polar currents, which met a strong\r\ndemand in Europe and the Antilles. The sudden southward drop of the 0°C.\r\nannual isothermal line toward the St. Lawrence and the Great Lakes\r\nbrought the northwestern fur trade to the back gate of New York, where\r\nit opened on the Mohawk and upper Hudson, and brought prosperity to the\r\nyoung colony. Even to-day the center of collection for the Canadian fur\r\nfields is Quebec, located at 47° north latitude, while the corresponding\r\npoint of concentration in Europe for the furs of Russia and Siberia is\r\nNizhni-Novgorod, which lies ten degrees farther north.[1426]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effect of slight climatic differences.]\r\n\r\nThis compression of the isotherms emphasizes the differences of national\r\ncharacters produced in part by dissimilar climatic conditions. Contrasts\r\nin temperament, manner of life, and point of view, like that between the\r\nNew Englander and Virginian, Chilean and Bolivian in the Americas,\r\nBreton and Provençal in France, Castilian and Andalusian in Spain,\r\nGurkha and Bengali in India, seem to bleach out when they are located\r\nfar apart, owing to many grades of transition between; but they become\r\nstriking, stimulating, productive of important economic and political\r\nresults, when close juxtaposition enables them to react sharply one upon\r\nthe other. In effecting these nice differentiations of local types,\r\nclimate is nearly always one of the factors at work, emphasizing perhaps\r\nan existing ethnic difference. Even the slight variations of\r\ntemperature to be found in the same zone or the same climatic region\r\nproduce distinct results, especially where they are harnessed, as is\r\nusually the case, with some other geographic condition of relief, area\r\nor soil, pulling in the same direction. Mexico, Peru, Italy,\r\nSwitzerland, Greece and Asia Minor, with its high plateau interior and\r\nits contrasted Euxine and Aegean coasts, represent each a complex of\r\nclimatic differences, which, reinforced by other geographic factors,\r\nhave made in these regions a polychrome picture of national life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effect of climate upon distribution of immigration]\r\n\r\nClimatic contrasts aid differentiation also by influencing both natural\r\nand artificial selection in the distribution of peoples. This effect is\r\nconspicuous in the distribution of immigrants in all colonial lands like\r\nAfrica, South America and in every part of the United States.[1427] The\r\nwarm, moist air of the Gulf and South Atlantic States is attracting back\r\nto the congenial habitat of the \"black belt\" the negroes of the North,\r\nwhere, moreover, their numbers are being further depleted by a harsh\r\nclimate, which finds in them a large proportion of the unfit. The\r\npresence of a big negro laboring class in the South, itself primarily a\r\nresult of climate, has long served to exclude foreign immigration, which\r\nsought therefore the unoccupied lands and the congenial climate of the\r\nmore bracing North. Hence it is both a direct and indirect effect of\r\nclimate that the North shows a large proportion of aliens, and the white\r\npopulation of the South an almost unadulterated English stock.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Climate and race temperament.]\r\n\r\nThe influence of climate upon race temperament, both as a direct and\r\nindirect effect, can not be doubted, despite an occasional exception,\r\nlike the cheery, genial Eskimos, who seem to carry in their sunny\r\nnatures an antidote to the cold and poverty of their environment. In\r\ngeneral a close correspondence obtains between climate and temperament.\r\nThe northern peoples of Europe are energetic, provident, serious,\r\nthoughtful rather than emotional, cautious rather than impulsive. The\r\nsoutherners of the sub-tropical Mediterranean basin are easy-going,\r\nimprovident except under pressing necessity, gay, emotional,\r\nimaginative, all qualities which among the negroes of the equatorial\r\nbelt degenerate into grave racial faults. If, as many ethnologists\r\nmaintain, the blond Teutons of the north are a bleached out branch of\r\nthe brunette Mediterranean race, this contrast in temperament is due to\r\nclimate. A comparison of northern and southern peoples of the same race\r\nand within the same Temperate Zone reveals numerous small differences of\r\nnature and character, which can be traced back directly or indirectly to\r\nclimatic differences, and which mount up to a considerable sum total.\r\nThe man of the colder habitat is more domestic, stays more in his home.\r\nThough he is not necessarily more moderate or continent than the\r\nsoutherner, he has to pay more for his indulgences, so he is economical\r\nin expenditures. With the southerner it is \"easy come, easy go.\" He\r\ntherefore suffers more frequently in a crisis. The low cost of living\r\nkeeps down his wages, so that as a laborer he is poorly paid. This fact,\r\ntogether with his improvidence, tends to swell the proletariat in warm\r\ncountries of the Temperate Zone; and though here it does not produce the\r\ndistressing impression of a proletariat in Dublin or Liverpool or\r\nBoston, it is always degrading. It levels society and economic status\r\ndownward, while in the cooler countries of the Temperate Zone, the\r\nprocess is upward. The laborer of the north, owing to his providence and\r\nlarger profits, which render small economies possible, is constantly\r\nrecruited into the class of the capitalist.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Contrasted temperaments in the same nation.]\r\n\r\nEverywhere a cold climate puts a steadying hand on the human heart and\r\nbrain. It gives an autumn tinge to life. Among the folk of warmer lands\r\neternal spring holds sway. National life and temperament have the\r\nbuoyancy and thoughtlessness of childhood, its charm and its weakness.\r\nThese distinctions and contrasts meet us everywhere. The southern\r\nChinese, and especially the Cantonese, is more irresponsible and\r\nhot-blooded than the Celestial of the north, though the bitter struggle\r\nfor existence in the over-crowded Kwangtung province has made him quite\r\nas industrious; but on his holidays he takes his pleasure in singing,\r\ngambling, and various forms of dissipation. The southern Russian is\r\ndescribed as more light-hearted than his kinsman of the bleaker north,\r\nthough both are touched with the melancholy of the Slav. In this case,\r\nhowever, the question immediately arises, how far the dweller of the\r\nsouthern wheat lands owes his happy disposition to the easy conditions\r\nof life in the fertile Ukraine, as opposed to the fiercer struggle for\r\nsubsistence in the glaciated lake and forest belt of the north. Similar\r\ndistinctions of climate and national temperament exist in the two\r\nsections of Germany. The contrast between the energetic, enterprising,\r\nself-contained Saxon of the Baltic lowland and the genial, spontaneous\r\nBavarian or Swabian is conspicuous, though the only geographical\r\nadvantage possessed by the latter is a warmer temperature attended by a\r\nsunnier sky. He contains in his blood a considerable infusion of the\r\nAlpine stock and is therefore racially differentiated from the northern\r\nTeuton,[1428] but this hardly accounts for the difference of temperament,\r\nbecause the same Alpine stock is plodding, earnest and rather stolid on\r\nthe northern slope of the Alps, but in the warm air and sunshine of the\r\nsouthern slope, it abates these qualities and conforms more nearly to\r\nthe Italian type of character. The North Italian, however, presents a\r\nstriking contrast to the indolent, irresponsible, improvident citizens\r\nof Naples, Calabria and Sicily, who belong to the contrasted\r\nMediterranean race, and have been longer subjected to the relaxing\r\neffects of sub-tropical heat.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Complexity of the geographic problem.]\r\n\r\nWhere the climatic difference is small, it is nevertheless often\r\nconspicuous enough to eclipse other concomitant factors which are at\r\nwork, and hence to encourage the formation of some easy blanket theory\r\nof climatic influences. But just because the difference is slight, all\r\nattending geographic and ethnic circumstances ought to be scrutinized,\r\nto insure a correct statement of the geographical equation. The contrast\r\nbetween the light-hearted, gracious peasants of warm, sunny Andalusia\r\nand the reserved, almost morose inhabitants of cool and cloudy Asturias\r\nis the effect not only of climate but of the easy life in a fertile\r\nriver plain, opposed to the bitter struggle for existence in the rough\r\nCantabrian Mountains. Moreover, a strong infusion of Alpine blood has\r\ngiven this group of Spanish mountaineers the patience and seriousness\r\nwhich characterizes the race in other parts of continental Europe.[1429]\r\nThe conditions which have differentiated Scotch from English have been\r\nclimate, relief, location, geologic composition of the soil, and ethnic\r\ncomposition of the two peoples. The divergent development of Northerners\r\nand Southerners in America arose from contrasts in climate, soil and\r\narea. It was not only the enervating heat and moisture of the Southern\r\nStates, but also the large extent of their fertile area which\r\nnecessitated slave labor, introduced the plantation system, and resulted\r\nin the whole aristocratic organization of society in the South.[1430]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Monotonous climatic conditions.]\r\n\r\nWhen one type of climate extends monotonously over a vast area, as in\r\nRussia. Siberia, Central Asia or immense tracts of Africa, the\r\ndifferences of temperature which prick and stimulate national endeavor\r\nin small climatic districts here lose much of their force. Their effects\r\nflatten out into insignificance, overwhelmed by the encounter with too\r\nlarge a territory. All the southern continents are handicapped by the\r\nmonotony of their zonal location. The map of annual isotherms shows\r\nAfrica quite enclosed between the two torrid lines of 20° Centigrade,\r\nexcept for a narrow sub-tropical belt along the Barbary coast in the\r\nnorth, and in the south an equally narrow littoral extending east and\r\nnorth from the Cape of Good Hope. At first glance, the large area of\r\nSouth Africa lying on the temperate side of the Tropic of Capricorn\r\nraises hopes for a rich economic, social and cultural development here;\r\nbut these are dashed by an examination of the isotherms. Excessive heat\r\nlays its retarding touch upon everything, while a prevailing aridity\r\n(rainfall less than 10 inches or 25 centimeters), except on the narrow\r\nwindward slope of the eastern mountains, gives the last touch of\r\nclimatic monotony. The coastal belt of Cape Colony and Natal raise\r\ntropical and sub-tropical products[1431] like all the rest of the\r\ncontinent, while the semi-arid interior is committed with little\r\nvariations to pastoral life. [See maps pages 484 and 487.] Climatic\r\nmonotony, operating alone, would have condemned South Africa to poverty\r\nof development, and will unquestionably always avail to impoverish its\r\nnational life. South African history has been made by its mines and by\r\nits location on the original water route to India; the first have\r\ndominated its economic development, and the latter has largely\r\ndetermined its ethnic elements--English, Dutch, and French Huguenots,\r\nwhile the magnet of the mines has drawn other nationalities and\r\nespecially a large Jewish contingent into the urban centers of the\r\nRand.[1432] In the background is the native Kaffir and Hottentot stocks,\r\nwhose blood filters into the lower classes of the white population. The\r\ndiversity of these ethnic elements may compensate in part for the\r\nmonotony of climatic conditions, which promise to check differentiation.\r\nHowever, climatic control is here peculiarly despotic. We see how it has\r\nconverted the urban merchants of Holland and the skillful Huguenot\r\nartisan of France into the crude pastoral Boer of the Transvaal.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to South Africa, temperate South America has an immense\r\nadvantage in its large area lying outside the 20°C. isotherm, and in the\r\nwide range of mean temperatures (from 20°C. to 5°C.) found between the\r\nTropic of Capricorn and Tierra del Fuego. Climate and relief have\r\ncombined to make the mouth of the La Plata River the site of the largest\r\ncity of the southern hemisphere. Buenos Ayres, with a population of over\r\na million, reflects its large temperate hinterland.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The effects of Arctic cold.]\r\n\r\nFrigid zones and the Tropics alike suffer from monotony, of Arctic the\r\none of cold and the other of heat. The Arctic climatic belt, extending\r\nfrom the isotherm of 0°C. (32°F.) to the pole, includes inhabited\r\ndistricts where the mean annual temperature is less than -15°C. (or\r\n5°F.), as at the Greenland village of Etah on Smith's Sound and the\r\nSiberian town of Verkhoyansk. Here the ground is covered with, ice or\r\nsnow most of the year, and permanently frozen below the surface. Animal\r\nand plant life are reduced to a minimum on the land, so that man, with\r\nevery poleward advance of his thin-strung settlements, is forced more\r\nand more to rely on the sea for his food. Hence he places his villages\r\non narrow strips of coast, as do the Norse of Finmarken, the Eskimo and\r\nthe Tunguse inhabiting the Arctic rim of Asia. Products of marine\r\nanimals make the basis of his domestic economy. Farther inland, which\r\nmeans farther south, all tribes live by hunting and fishing. The\r\nEurasian Hyperboreans find additional subsistence in their reindeer\r\nherds, which they pasture on the starchy lichen (Cladonia rangiferina)\r\nof the tundra. [See maps pages 103, 153.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Similarity of cultural development.]\r\n\r\nThough these Arctic folk are sprung from diverse race stocks, close\r\nvicinal location around an enclosed sea has produced some degree of\r\nblood relationship. But whatever their origins, the harsh conditions of\r\ntheir life have imposed upon them all a similar civilization. All\r\npopulation is sparse and more or less nomadic, since agriculture alone\r\nroots settlement. They have the same food, the same clothing, the same\r\ntypes of summer and winter dwellings, whether it is the earth hut of the\r\nEskimo or of the coast Lapp, the Siberian Yukagirs of the Kolima River,\r\nor the Samoyedes of northeastern Russia.[1433] The spur of necessity has\r\naroused their ingenuity to a degree found nowhere in the drowsy Tropics\r\nof Africa. Dread of cold led the Yakuts of the Lena Valley to glaze the\r\nwindows of their huts with slabs of ice, which are better nonconductors\r\nof heat and cold, and can be made more perfectly air-tight than glass.\r\nHence these windows have been adopted by Russian colonists. The Eskimo\r\ndevised the oil lamp, an invention found nowhere else in primitive\r\nAmerica, and fishing tackle so perfect that white men coming to fish in\r\nArctic waters found it superior to their own.\r\n\r\nOwing to the inexorable restriction of their natural resources, contact\r\nwith European commerce has impoverished the Hyperborean natives. It has\r\ncaused the rapid and ruthless exploitation of their meager resources,\r\nwhich means eventual starvation. So long as the Ostyaks, before the\r\ncoming of the Russians, were sole masters of the vast forests of the Obi\r\nValley, they commanded a supply of fish and fur animals which sufficed\r\nfor their sparse population. But the greed of the Russian fish dealers\r\nand fur traders, and the devastating work of the lumbermen have made\r\ndouble war upon Ostyak sources of subsistence.[1434] The appearance of the\r\nwhite man in Alaskan waters was the signal for the indiscriminate\r\nkilling of seal and other marine animals, till the Eskimo's supply of\r\nfood and furs has been seriously invaded, from Greenland to the\r\noutermost Aleutian Islands. In all this wide territory, climatic\r\nconditions forbid any substitute for the original products, except the\r\ndomesticated reindeer on the tundra of the mainland; but this would\r\nnecessitate the transformation of the Eskimo from a hunting to a\r\npastoral people. This task the government at Washington has undertaken,\r\nbut with scant success.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cold and health]\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the numerous indirect effects of a frigid climate, no\r\ndirect physiological effect can be positively ascribed to intense cold.\r\nIt lays no bodily handicap on health and energy, as does the excessive\r\nheat of the Tropics. The coldest regions where tillage is possible are\r\ntolerable places of residence, because their winters are intensely dry.\r\nThat of central Siberia, which is drier than the driest desert, makes\r\ntent life comfortable in the coldest season, provided the tenter be clad\r\nin furs. The low temperatures of the Canadian Northwest for the same\r\nreason have not repelled settlers even from the Southern States.\r\nNegroes, however, meet a climatic barrier in America at the isotherm of\r\n5° Centigrade (41° F.). They are found in New England and Nova Scotia,\r\ngenerally with a large admixture of white blood; but there and farther\r\nnorth where the climate is moist as well as cold, they show a fatal\r\ntendency to pulmonary diseases.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The small amount of tropical emigration]\r\n\r\nThe acclimatization of tropical people in temperate regions will never\r\nbe a question of widespread importance. The negroes were involuntary\r\nimmigrants to America, under conditions that can never recur. Their\r\nconcentration in the \"black belt,\" where they find the heat and moisture\r\nin which they thrive, and their climatically conditioned exclusion from\r\nthe more northern states are matters of local significance. Economic and\r\nsocial retardation have kept the hot belt relatively underpopulated. The\r\ndensity map shows much the largest part of it with a population less\r\nthan 25 to the square mile. Only the small portion contained in India,\r\nsouthernmost China, and Java shows a density over 125 to the square mile\r\n(or 50 to the square kilometer). This density has to rise to 500 or more\r\nto the square mile before emigration begins. The would-be exiles then\r\nhave a wide choice of new homes in other tropical lands, where they find\r\ncongenial climate and phases of economic development into which they\r\nwill fit. East Indian coolies are found in Cape Colony, Natal, Zanzibar,\r\nTrinidad, and British Guiana, where they constitute 38 per cent. of the\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effects of tropical climate.]\r\n\r\nThe redundant population of crowded western and southern Europe also\r\nseek these sparsely inhabited Tropics, but they come heavily handicapped\r\nby the necessity of acclimatization. They leave their homes from\r\nTrondhjem and Stockholm in the north to the Mediterranean in the south,\r\nwhere the mean annual temperatures vary from 5° to 17° C, (41° to 63°\r\nF.), to seek the Torrid Zone which averages 25° C. or 77° F. over most\r\nof its territory. The effects of a tropical climate are due to intense\r\nheat, to its long duration without the respite conferred by a bracing\r\nwinter season, and its combination with the high degree of humidity\r\nprevailing over most of the Torrid Zone. These are conditions\r\nadvantageous to plant life, but hardly favorable to human development.\r\nThey produce certain derangements in the physiological functions of\r\nheart, liver, kidneys and organs of reproduction. Bodily temperature\r\nrises, while susceptibility to disease and rate of mortality show an\r\nincrease ominous for white colonization. The general effect is intense\r\nenervation; this starts a craving for stimulants and induces habits of\r\nalcoholism which are accountable for many bodily ills usually attributed\r\nto direct climatic influences. Transfer to the Tropics tends to relax\r\nthe mental and moral fiber, induces indolence, self-indulgences and\r\nvarious excesses which lower the physical tone.[1435] The social control\r\nof public opinion in the new environment is weak, while temptation, due\r\nto both climatic and social causes, is peculiarly strong. The presence\r\nof an inferior, more or less servile native population, relaxes both\r\nconscience and physical energy just when both need a tonic. The result\r\nis general enervation, deterioration both as economic and political\r\nagents.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Historical significance of deterioration]\r\n\r\nThis is the effect of climate which has had the most far-reaching and\r\npersistent historical consequences. Our study of the historical\r\nmovements of peoples in the northern hemisphere revealed a steady influx\r\nfrom colder into tropical and sub-tropical lands, followed always by\r\nenervation and loss of national efficiency, due partly to the\r\ndebilitating heat of the new habitat, partly to its easier conditions of\r\nliving, whether the intruders came as conquerors and appropriated the\r\nfat of the land, or as immigrant colonists who dropped into slack\r\nmethods of agriculture, because rain and sun and soil made their\r\nreluctant labor scarcely necessary. Everywhere in the Tropics the\r\nenervating effects of heat, moisture, and abundance make not only the\r\nnatives averse to steady work, but start the energetic European\r\nimmigrant down the same easy descent to Avernus. Passing over the\r\ndeterioration of the Aryans in India, the Persians in Mesopotamia, and\r\nthe Vandals in Africa, we find that modern instances show the\r\ntransformation to be very rapid. The French who since 1715 have occupied\r\nthe islands of Réunion and Mauritius have lost much of their thrift and\r\nenergy, though their new homes lie just within the southern tropic, and\r\nare blessed with an oceanic climate. Yet the volunteer troops sent by\r\nRéunion to aid in the recent subjugation of the Hovas in Madagascar\r\nproved to be utterly useless.[1436] The Spaniards who come to-day to\r\nMexico have great energy, born of their former hard conditions of life\r\nin Spain. But their children are reared in a country whose mean annual\r\ntemperature, even on the plateau, exceeds that of Spain by 10°C. (or\r\n18°F.), a difference equal to that between Mobile and New York, or\r\nMadrid and Christiania. Hence they are less energetic and vigorous,\r\nwhile the third generation are typical Mexicans in their easy-going way\r\nof life.[1437] The Germans who recently have colonized southern Brazil in\r\ngreat numbers show a similar deterioration under similar increase of\r\nmean annual temperature, combined with somewhat greater humidity, which\r\nintensifies the debilitating effects of the heat. An investigation made\r\nin 1900 by the International Harvester Company of America revealed the\r\nfact that the German farmer in the State of Santa Catharina rarely\r\ncultivated over one acre of grain.[1438] Much of the iron in the blood and\r\nconscience of the New England missionary stock which went to Hawaii two\r\ngenerations ago has been dissolved out by the warm rain and balmy air of\r\nthe islands.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The problem of acclimatization.]\r\n\r\nIn all these instances the white race has been successfully\r\ntransplanted. It has domiciled itself on the borders of the Tropics and\r\nhas propagated its kind, though it has abated some of the vigorous\r\nqualities which characterized it in its temperate fatherland. In the\r\nreal Tropics like India, Cochin China, the Malay Archipelago, and\r\nCentral Africa, the whole perplexing and urgent problem of European\r\ncolonization turns on the difficulty or impossibility of\r\nacclimatization; and this in turn affects the whole economic, ethnic and\r\npolitical destiny of present colonial holdings. If acclimatization is\r\nimpossible, the alternative is an imported ruling class, constantly\r\ninvalided and as constantly renewed, aided by a similar commercial body\r\nacting as superintendents of labor; the whole machine of government and\r\neconomic exploitation is supported by a permanent servile native\r\npopulation, doing the preeminently tropical work of agriculture, which\r\nis so fatal to the white man in a torrid climate. This means that the\r\nconquering white race of the Temperate Zone is to be excluded by adverse\r\nclimatic conditions from the productive but undeveloped Tropics, unless\r\nit consents to hybridization, like the Spaniards and Portuguese of\r\ntropical America. In that national struggle for existence which is a\r\nstruggle for space, it means an added advantage for the Mediterranean\r\npeoples, that they are more tolerant of a torrid climate than the blond\r\nTeutons, whose disability in this regard is pronounced; it means that\r\nthe aptitude of the Chinese for a wide range of climatic accommodation,\r\nfrom the Arctic circle to the equator, lends color to \"the yellow\r\nperil.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Historical importance of the temperate zones.]\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the monotonous extremes of climate in the hot and cold\r\nzones, temperate lands are characterized by the intermediate degrees of\r\nannual temperature and marked seasonal diversity which are so favorable\r\nto human development. In Arctic lands labor is paralyzed by cold as it\r\nis by heat in the enervating and overproductive Tropics. In one, the\r\ngrowing season is too short and ill-favored; in the other, too long to\r\nstimulate man to sustained industry. Hence the Temperate Zones, whose\r\nclimate avoids both these extremes and abounds in contrasts, whose\r\nsummers are productive enough to supply food for the winter, and whose\r\nwinters give both motive and energy for the summer's work, are richer in\r\ncultural possibilities and hence in historical importance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effects of contrasted seasons.]\r\n\r\nThe advantage of the Temperate Zone is not only its moderate and\r\nadequate allowance of heat, but its contrast of seasons. Beyond the\r\nrange of a vertical sun, grades of temperature change rapidly from\r\nlatitude to latitude and from summer to winter. The seasons bring\r\nvariety of activities, which sharply react upon one another.\r\nManufactures were in their origin chiefly winter industries, as they\r\nstill are in small isolated communities. The modern factory system\r\nflourishes best in cooler parts of the Temperate Zone, where the\r\nagricultural demands of the summer, spreading over a shorter period,\r\nleave a longer time for winter work, and where that once long winter of\r\nthe Glacial Period, by the scouring action of the ice cap, has reduced\r\nthe fertile area of the northern fields. The factory system is also\r\nfavored, as Heinrich von Treitschke maintains, by the predominance of\r\ncool or cold weather, which facilitates the concentration of numerous\r\nworkmen in large buildings, and renders possible long labor hours the\r\nyear round,[1439]--conditions unthinkable in a warm climate. The iron and\r\nsteel industries which have grown up about Birmingham, Alabama, find\r\nthat the long hot summers and mild winters reduce the efficiency of\r\ntheir skilled labor imported from the North.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effects of length of seasons.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effect of long winters.]\r\n\r\nThe length of the seasons is of conspicuous importance. It determines,\r\nfor instance, whether a given climate permits continuous field work with\r\nsummer and winter crops, whether field work is possible at all, and how\r\nlong it is interrupted by excessive cold. Buckle maintains that climate\r\nnot only enervates or invigorates man, but affects also the constancy of\r\nhis work and his capacity for sustained labor throughout the year. He\r\nconsiders \"that no people living in a very northern latitude have ever\r\npossessed that steady and unflinching industry for which the inhabitants\r\nof temperate regions are remarkable\" and assigns as a reason \"that the\r\nseverity of the weather, and, at some seasons, the deficiency of light,\r\nrender it impossible for the people to continue their usual out-of-door\r\nemployments.\" The result of this he finds to be desultory habits of\r\nwork, which help to make the national character fitful and capricious.\r\nHe cites in illustration of his principle the people of the Scandinavian\r\nand Iberian peninsulas, whom he finds marked \"by a certain instability\r\nand fickleness of character,\" owing to the fact that in Norway and\r\nSweden agricultural labor experiences long interruptions, due to the\r\nseverity of the winter and the shortness of the days; in Spain and\r\nPortugal owing to the heat and drought of summer.[1440] The extreme\r\ncontinental climate of northern of Russia with its violent contrast of\r\nthe seasons, its severe and protracted winters, enables Leroy-Beaulieu\r\nto make a safer application of this principle to the empire of the\r\nCzars, which, unlike Scandinavia, feels no ameliorating effect from the\r\nmild Atlantic winds and commands no alternative industries like dairy\r\nfarming, fisheries, and maritime trade.[1441] Hence Leroy-Beaulieu\r\nattributes the unsystematic, desultory habits of work prevailing among\r\nthe northern peasants to the long intermission of labor in winter, and\r\nto the alternation of a short period of intense activity with a long\r\nperiod of enforced idleness. He finds them resembling southern peoples\r\nin their capacity for sudden spurts of energy rather than sustained\r\neffort, thinks them benumbed by the sloth of the far north, which is not\r\nunlike the sloth of the south.[1442]\r\n\r\nThe dominant continental and central location of Russia enables its\r\nclimatic extremes to operate with little check. The peripheral location\r\nof Scandinavia in the path of the Atlantic winds modifies its climate to\r\na mild oceanic type, and its dominant maritime situation gives its\r\npeople the manifold resources of a typical coast land. Hence Buckle's\r\nestimate of national character in the Scandinavian Peninsula has little\r\nbasis as to fact or cause. Irregularity of agricultural labor does not\r\nmean here cessation of all labor, and hence does not produce the\r\nfar-reaching effect ascribed to it. Only about one-third of the\r\nNorwegian population is engaged in agriculture. The restriction of its\r\narable and meadow land to 3 per cent. of the whole territory, and the\r\nfact that a large proportion of the people are employed in shipping and\r\nthe fisheries,[1443] are due to several geographic factors besides\r\nclimate. The same thing is true of Sweden in a modified degree.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Complexity of climatic effects.]\r\n\r\nCaution should be exercised in drawing conclusions from climate alone or\r\nfrom only one phase of its influence. The duration and intensity of the\r\nseasons affects not only the manner of work, but the whole mode of life\r\nof a people. On the Yukon, in Iceland, and the high mountain valleys of\r\nthe Alps, winter puts a check not only upon out-of-door labor, but upon\r\nall public or community life. Intercourse stops or is greatly\r\nrestricted. The outside world drops away. In Iceland, the law courts are\r\nin session only in summer when the roads by sea and land are open. In\r\nthe Kentucky mountains the district schools close before Christmas, when\r\nthe roads become impassable from rain and snow; the summer is the gala\r\ntime for funeral services, for only then can the preacher or\r\n\"circuit-rider\" reach the graves made in the winter. Therefore the\r\nfunerals in one community accumulate, so to speak, and finally, when\r\nleisure comes after the August harvest, they make the occasion for\r\nimportant social gatherings. Much of the influence of winter lies in its\r\npower to isolate.\r\n\r\nIt is the economic effects of such periods of enforced idleness which\r\nare most obvious, both in their power to restrict national wealth and\r\nkeep down density of population. When long, they limit subsistence to\r\nthe products of a short growing season, except where local mining adds\r\nconsiderable sources of revenue. In the Russian government of Yaroslaf,\r\nlocated on the northernmost bend of the Volga within the agricultural\r\nbelt, and containing the chief inland wheat market of the Empire, the\r\nfield labor of four months must support the population for the remaining\r\neight months of the year. The half of Russia included in the cold forest\r\nzone of the north maintains meagerly a sparse population, and can hope\r\nfor an increase of the same only by the encouragement of Industrial\r\npursuits. Here the long winter leisure has created the handicrafts on\r\nwhich so many villages rely, and which in turn have given rise to\r\npeddling,[1444] as we have seen it do in high mountain regions where\r\naltitude intensifies and prolongs the winter season. Agricultural and\r\nindustrial life are still undivorced, just as in primitive communities.\r\nThe resulting population has also the primitive mark of great sparsity,\r\nso that modern industry, which depends upon a concentrated labor force,\r\nis here inhibited. Hence Russian manufactures, which are so active in\r\nthe governments of Vladimir, Moscow, and St. Petersburg, cease beyond\r\nthe sixtieth parallel, which defines the northern limit of the\r\nagricultural belt and the beginning of the forest and the fur zone.[1445]\r\n[See maps pages 8 and 612.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Social effects of long winters.]\r\n\r\nThe rigorous climate of Russia was undoubtedly one cause for the\r\nattachment of the peasants to the soil in 1593. This measure was\r\nresorted to at a time when the Muscovite dominion from its center in\r\nGreat Russia had recently been extended at the expense of the Tartars,\r\nand had thus embraced fertile southern lands, which tempted the northern\r\npeasant away from his unfruitful fields.[1446] This attraction, coupled\r\nwith the free and hopeful life of the frontier, met the migrant instinct\r\nbred in the peasant by the wide plains and far horizon of Russia, so\r\nthat the north threatened to be left without cultivators. Later, the\r\nharsh climatic conditions of the north were advanced as an argument\r\nagainst the abolition of serfdom, on the ground that this system alone\r\nsecured to the landed proprietor a steady labor supply, and guaranteed\r\nto the peasant his maintenance during the long, idle winter.\r\n\r\nThe duration and severity of the cold season has put a drag upon the\r\nwheel of enterprise in Canada, as opposed to the warmer United States.\r\nThe prairies of the Canadian Northwest, whose fertile soil should early\r\nhave attracted settlement, were a closed land till railroads could pour\r\ninto it every summer from the warmer south and east a seasonal tide of\r\nlaborers. These follow the harvest as it advances from point to point,\r\nand then withdraw in autumn either to the lumber camps of eastern\r\nCanada, Minnesota and Wisconsin, or to seek other forms of out-door\r\nlabor in the more southern states, thus lifting from the Canadian farmer\r\nthe burden of their winter support.\r\n\r\nIn the lower latitudes of the Temperate Zones, where the growing season\r\nis long and the dormant period correspondingly short and mild, we find\r\nagriculture based upon clearly distinguished winter and summer crops, as\r\nin the northern Punjab (30° to 34° N. L.);[1447] or producing a quick\r\nsuccession of valuable crops, where the fertility of the soil can be\r\nmaintained by manures or irrigating streams, as in many of the warmer\r\nSouthern States and in Spain[1448] respectively. In Argentine, where\r\ntillage is extensive, land abundant, and population sparse, where, in\r\nfact, \"skimp farming\" is the rule, the shrewd cultivator takes advantage\r\nof the long growing season to stretch out his period of sowing and\r\nreaping, and thus tills a larger area. The International Harvester\r\nCompany of America, investigating the reason for the small number of\r\nreaping machines employed in Argentine in proportion to the area under\r\ncultivation, found that the simple climatic condition of a long growing\r\nseason enabled one reaper to serve about twice the acreage usual in the\r\nUnited States, because it could work twice as long.[1449]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Zones of culture.]\r\n\r\nOver and beyond slight local variations of climate and season within the\r\nsame zone, which contribute their quota to economic and historical\r\nresults, it is the fundamental differences between the hot, cold and\r\ntemperate climatic zones that produce the most conspicuous and abiding\r\neffects. These broad belts, each with its characteristic climatic\r\nconditions and appropriate civilization, form so many girdles of culture\r\naround the earth. They have their dominant features of heat and cold,\r\nvariously combined with moisture and aridity, which give a certain zonal\r\nstamp to human temperature and development.\r\n\r\nThe two cold belts have little claim to the name of cultural zones,\r\nsince their inability to support more than an insignificant population\r\nhas made them almost a negligible factor in history. [Compare maps pages\r\n8, 9, and 612.] The discoveries and settlements of the Northmen in\r\nGreenland remained a barren historical event, though the vikings' ships\r\nreached a new hemisphere. Iceland is the only land in this sub-arctic\r\nregion which ever figured upon the stage of history; and its rôle was\r\nessentially passive. Such prominence as it acquired was due to its\r\nisland nature and its situation in a swirl of the Gulf Stream, which\r\nameliorates the worst climatic effects of its far northern location, and\r\nbrings it just within the upper limit of the temperate belt. The wide\r\nsub-arctic lowlands of Russia and Siberia, which, from the Ural\r\nMountains to the lower Amur River, stretch the cold zone well below the\r\nsixtieth parallel, have at times in the last three centuries and\r\nespecially in the past decade thrown their great mass into the scale of\r\neastern Asiatic history. This has been possible because the hot summer\r\ncharacteristic of continental climates forces the July isotherm of 20°C.\r\nnorthward over the vast heated surface of Asia nearly to the sixtieth\r\nparallel, well within the borders of Siberia. It gives that belt the\r\nshort but warm growing season with protracted hours of sunshine which\r\nis so favorable to cereals, lending to Omsk, Tomsk, Vitimsk and all the\r\nstretch of Russian settlements in Siberia, an admirable summer climate\r\nlike that of the Canadian Northwest.[1450]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The cradle of civilization.]\r\n\r\nThe North Temperate Zone is preëminently the culture zone of the earth.\r\nIt is the seat of the most important, most steadily progressive\r\ncivilizations, and the source of all the cultural stimuli which have\r\ngiven an upward start to civilization in other zones during the past\r\nthree centuries. It contains the Mediterranean basin, which was the\r\npulsing heart of ancient history, and all the modern historically\r\nimportant regions of Europe, Asia, Africa, and America. The temperate\r\nbelt of the southern hemisphere also is following its lead, since\r\nEuropean civilization has been transplanted to other parts of the world.\r\nThis is the zone which least suffers from the drawbacks of climatic\r\nmonotony or extremes, and best combines, especially in the northern\r\nhemisphere, the wide range of annual and seasonal variety so favorable\r\nto economic and cultural development, with the incalculable advantage of\r\nlarge land area.\r\n\r\nMan grew in the temperate zone, was born in the Tropics. There, in his\r\nprimitive, pre-civilized state, he lived in a moist, warm, uniform\r\nclimate which supplied abundantly his simple wants, put no strain upon\r\nhis feeble intellect and will. That first crude human product of\r\nNature's Pliocene workshop turned out in the steaming lowland of Java,\r\nand now known to us as the _Pithecanthropus erectus_, found about him\r\nthe climatic conditions generally conceded to have been necessary for\r\nman in his helpless, futile infancy. Where man has remained in the\r\nTropics, with few exceptions he has suffered arrested development. His\r\nnursery has kept him a child. Though his initial progress depended upon\r\nthe gifts which Nature put into his hands, his later evolution depended\r\nfar more upon the powers which she developed within him. These have no\r\nlimit, so far as our experience shows; but their growth is painful,\r\nreluctant. Therefore they develop only where Nature subjects man to\r\ncompulsion, forces him to earn his daily bread, and thereby something\r\nmore than bread. This compulsion is found in less luxurious but more\r\nsalutary geographic conditions than the Tropics afford, in an\r\nenvironment that exacts a tribute of labor and invention in return for\r\nthe boon of life, but offers a reward certain and generous enough to\r\ninsure the accumulation of wealth which marks the beginning of\r\ncivilization.[1451]\r\n\r\nMost of the ancient civilizations originated just within the mild but\r\ndrier margin of the Temperate Zone, where the cooler air of a short\r\nwinter acted like a tonic upon the energies relaxed by the lethargic\r\natmosphere of the hot and humid Tropics; where congenial warmth\r\nencouraged vegetation, but where the irrigation necessary to secure\r\nabundant and regular crops called forth inventiveness, coöperation, and\r\nsocial organization, and gave to the people their first baptism of\r\nredemption from savagery to barbarism. Native civilizations of limited\r\ndevelopment have arisen in the Tropics, but only where, as in Yemen,\r\nMexico and Peru, a high, cool, semi-arid plateau, a restricted area of\r\nfertile soil, and a protected location alternately coddled and spurred\r\nthe nascent people.\r\n\r\nAs the Tropics have been the cradle of humanity, the Temperate Zone has\r\nbeen the cradle and school of civilization. Here Nature has given much\r\nby withholding much. Here man found his birthright, the privilege of the\r\nstruggle.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n[1409] G.G.
