The history, as it now stands,\r\nrepresents the services of the Corps in detail as far as the year 1815,\r\nand gives a summary of the services of those batteries now in existence,\r\nwhich represent the troops and companies of the old Royal Horse\r\nArtillery, and of the nine senior battalions of the Royal Artillery. The\r\ntables at the end of both volumes will also assist the reader in tracing\r\nthe antecedents of every battery in the Regiment.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe author takes this opportunity of expressing his gratitude to his\r\nbrother officers for the cordial sympathy and encouragement which he has\r\nreceived from them during his labours, and his hope that the noble\r\nnarrative commenced by him will not long remain unfinished. The\r\nimportance of completing the record of the Corps' services in the Crimea\r\nand India, while the officers who served in these campaigns are yet\r\nalive, is very apparent; and the author would respectfully suggest that\r\nany documents throwing light upon these services, which are in the\r\npossession of any one belonging to, or interested in the Corps, should\r\nbe deposited for safe keeping, and for reference, in the Regimental\r\nRecord Office at Woolwich.\r\n\r\n_March 2, 1874._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMONG the uneducated, discipline is created by fear, and confirmed by\r\nhabit. Among the educated, the agency at work is more complicated.\r\nSympathy with the machine of which the individual finds himself a part,\r\nand a reasoning apprehension of the necessity of discipline, are mingled\r\nwith a strong feeling of responsibility; and, as in the former case,\r\nhabit steps in to cement the whole. Of all these agents, the noblest is\r\nundoubtedly the sense of responsibility, and the highest duty of a\r\nmilitary commander is to awaken this sense where it does not exist, and\r\nto confirm and strengthen it where it does.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwo means may be employed to ensure this end. First: let the importance\r\nof his duty be impressed on the individual, and let the value in a\r\nmilitary sense of what might seem at first sight trivial be carefully\r\ndemonstrated. Let it be explained that neglect of some seemingly slight\r\nduty may disarrange the whole machine; and that for this reason no duty,\r\nin a soldier's eyes, should appear slight or trivial. Second: let an\r\n_esprit de corps_ be fostered, such as shall make a man feel it a shame\r\nto be negligent or unworthy.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHistory has a power to awaken this _esprit_, which it is impossible to\r\noverrate. Its power reaches the educated and the uneducated alike; it\r\nbegets a sympathy with the past, which is a sure agent in creating\r\ncohesion in the present; for the interest which binds us to our\r\npredecessors binds us also to one another. In this cohesion and sympathy\r\nis to be found the most sublime form of true discipline.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CONTENTS OF VOL.

an old man\r\nmight have been seen pacing daily up and down near the Ordnance Offices\r\nin the Tower of London, growing shabbier day by day, more hopeless and\r\npurposeless in his gait, yet seeming bound to the place either by\r\nexpectation or command.\r\n\r\nAt last with trembling hand he prepared for the Honourable Board of\r\nOrdnance the following quaint petition:—\r\n\r\n                \"The humble Petition of John Hawling, Master Gunner of\r\n                  His Majesty's Castle of Chester.\"\r\n\r\n  \"SHEWETH:—\r\n\r\n  \"That y^e Petitioner being commanded up by special order from the\r\n  office hath remained here y^e space of 13 weeks to his great cost\r\n  and charges, he being a very poor and ancient man, not having\r\n  wherewithal to subsist in so chargeable a place.\r\n\r\n  \"He therefor most humbly implores y^r Hon^{rs} to take his sad\r\n  condition into your Honours' consideration, and to restore him to\r\n  his place again, y^t he may return to his habitation with such\r\n  commands as your Hon^{rs} shall think fitt to lay upon him.\r\n\r\n               \"And your Petitioner as in duty bound shall ever pray.\"\r\n\r\nTo which Petition the Honourable Board returned the following peremptory\r\nanswer:—\r\n\r\n  \"Let y^e Petitioner return back to Chester Castle, and there submit\r\n  himself to Sir Jeoffrey Shakerley, Governor, in y^e presence of Sir\r\n  Peter Pindar and Mr. Anderton, and obey y^e orders of y^e Governor\r\n  and Lieut.-Governor of y^e said castle, and upon his said\r\n  submission and obedience, let him continue and enjoy his former\r\n  employment of Master Gunner there, so long as he shall so behave\r\n  himselfe accordingly.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Hawling, this poor and ancient man, was one of the small class of\r\nMaster Gunners, and Gunners of Garrisons, who with the few fee'd Gunners\r\nat the Tower, represented the only permanent force of Artillery in those\r\ndays in England. Their scientific attainments as Artillerists were\r\nsmall, and their sense of discipline was feeble. To take a very\r\nsuperficial charge of Ordnance Stores, and to resent any military\r\ninterference, such as at Chester seems to have driven John Hawling into\r\nmutiny, but at the same time to cringe to the Board, which was the\r\nsource of their annual income, represented in their minds the sum and\r\nsubstance of their duties. And taking into consideration John Hawling's\r\noffence, his advanced years, and his petition, we do not err in taking\r\nhim as a representative man.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the House of Commons, on the 22nd of February, 1872, the Secretary of\r\nState for War rose to move the Army Estimates for the ensuing year.\r\nThese included provision for a Regiment of Artillery, numbering—\r\nincluding those serving in India—34,943 officers, non-commissioned\r\nofficers, and men.\r\n\r\nAlthough divided into Horse, Field, and Garrison Artillery, and\r\nincluding no less than twenty-nine Brigades, besides a large Depôt, this\r\nlarge force, representing the permanent Artillery Force of Great\r\nBritain, was one vast regiment—the Royal Regiment of Artillery.\r\n\r\nTo trace the growth, from so small an acorn, of so noble a tree, is a\r\ntask which would inspire the boldest author with diffidence: and when\r\nthe duty is undertaken by one who has had no experience in historical\r\nwriting, he is bound to justify himself to his readers for his temerity.\r\n\r\nWhen the writer of the following pages assumed, in January, 1871, the\r\nduties of Superintendent of the Royal Artillery Regimental Records, he\r\nfound a method and order established by his predecessor, Major R.\r\nOldfield, R.A., all the more remarkable when compared with the chaos too\r\noften prevailing in Record offices. The idea immediately occurred to him\r\nthat if ever a History of the Regiment were to be written—a book greatly\r\nwanted, and yet becoming every day more difficult to write—here, in this\r\noffice, could it most easily be done. This feeling became so strong in\r\nhis mind, that it overcame the reluctance he felt to step into an arena\r\nfor which he had received no special training.\r\n\r\nThe unwillingness felt by him was increased by the knowledge that there\r\nwas in the Regiment an officer, Colonel F. Miller, V.C., who was\r\neminently qualified for writing such a History. Other and more pressing\r\nduties had, however, prevented that officer from undertaking a work\r\nwhich he had once contemplated; but of the many documents and books\r\nwhich the author of the following pages has made use of for his purpose,\r\nnone has been more valuable than an exhaustive pamphlet published some\r\nyears ago by Colonel Miller for private circulation, and his recent\r\nedition of Kane's list of Artillery officers, with its comprehensive\r\nAppendix.\r\n\r\nIt has been said above that the writing of this History has been every\r\nyear becoming more difficult. The statement requires explanation, as the\r\ndifficulty is not caused so much by the accumulation—continually going\r\non—of modern records, which might bury the old ones out of sight, as by\r\na change in the organization of the Regiment which took place some years\r\nago, and which sadly dislocated its history, although possibly improving\r\nits efficiency. In the year 1859, the old system which divided the\r\nRegiment into Companies and Battalions, with permanent Battalion\r\nHeadquarters at Woolwich, was abolished; and Companies serving in\r\ndifferent parts of the Empire were linked together in Brigades, on\r\ngrounds of Geography, instead of History. Companies of different\r\nBattalions serving on the same station were christened Batteries of the\r\nsame Brigade, and the old Battalion staff at Woolwich became the staff,\r\nat various stations, of the Brigades newly created. The old Companies,\r\nin donning their new titles, lost their old history and began their life\r\nanew. Every year as it passed made the wall which had been built between\r\nthe present and the past of the Regiment more nearly approach the\r\nstudent's horizon, and the day seemed imminent when it would be\r\nimpossible to make the existing Batteries know and realize that the\r\nglorious History of the old Companies was their own legitimate property.\r\n\r\nThe evil of such a state can hardly be described. The importance of\r\nmaintaining the _esprit_ of Batteries cannot be overrated. And _esprit_\r\nfeeds and flourishes upon history.\r\n\r\nNor can Battery _esprit_ be created by a _general_ Regimental history.\r\nThe _particular_ satisfies the appetite which refuses to be nourished\r\nupon the _general_. The memory which will gloat over the stories of\r\nMinden, Gibraltar, or Waterloo, will look coldly on the Regimental Motto\r\n\"Ubique.\" Therefore, he who would make the influence of history most\r\nsurely felt by an Artilleryman must spare no labour in tracing the links\r\nwhich connect the Batteries of the present with the Companies of the\r\npast. For the Battery is the unit of Artillery: all other organization\r\nis accidental. Whether the administrative web, which encloses a number\r\nof Batteries, be called a Battalion or a Brigade system, is a matter of\r\nsecondary importance. It is by Batteries that Artillerymen make War; and\r\nit is by Batteries that their history should be traced.\r\n\r\nWith this feeling uppermost in his mind, the author of these pages has\r\nendeavoured on every occasion to revive the memories which will be dear\r\nto the officers and men of Batteries—memories which ran a risk of being\r\nlost with the introduction of a new nomenclature. On such memories an\r\n_esprit de corps_, which no legislation can create, will blossom easily\r\nand brilliantly; and no weapon for discipline in the hand of a commander\r\nwill be found more true than the power of appealing to his men to\r\nremember the reputation which their predecessors earned with their\r\nlives.\r\n\r\nThis first volume will give the present designation, the past history,\r\nand the succession of Captains of the whole of the Companies of the\r\nseven Battalions formed during the last century and of the old troops of\r\nthe Royal Horse Artillery. In the succeeding volumes, the same course\r\nwill be pursued with regard to the later Battalions.\r\n\r\nThese stories will be all the more precious now, as the importance of\r\nthe Battery as a tactical unit has been so distinctly recognized by His\r\nRoyal Highness the Duke of Cambridge within the last few months, and its\r\nresponsibility and value as a command have been so recently and\r\ngenerously marked by the present Secretary of State for War.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe author does not pretend to underrate the difficulties of the task\r\nwhich he has undertaken—difficulties which cannot be realized by those\r\nwho see merely these inadequate results of his labours. Not the least\r\nwas the difficulty of knowing where to begin. The Regimental\r\norganization is comparatively recent; and had he confined his labours to\r\nthe last one hundred and sixty years, his task would have been greatly\r\nlessened, and yet he might have said with literal truth that he had\r\nwritten a History of the Royal Artillery. But surely in any History\r\nworthy of the name there were antecedent circumstances which could not\r\nbe left unnoticed, such as the circumstances which brought about the\r\nbirth of the Regiment, the blunders and failures which marked the old\r\nsystem in England as wrong and foolish, and the necessity, which\r\ngradually dawned, of having in the country a _permanent_, instead of a\r\n_spasmodic_ force of Artillery.\r\n\r\nRepudiating, therefore, the notion that the Regiment's History should\r\ncommence with its first parade, how far was he to penetrate in his\r\nantiquarian researches? There was a danger of wearying his reader, which\r\nhad to be avoided fully as carefully as the risk of omitting necessary\r\ninformation, for a history—to be useful in awakening _esprit de corps_—\r\nshould be _read_, not shelved as a work of reference. It is in this part\r\nof his labours that the author has to appeal for the greatest\r\nindulgence, because writing, as he has generally done, with all his\r\ndocuments and authorities round him for reference, he may unconsciously\r\nhave omitted some details most necessary to the reader; or with some\r\npicture clearly present to his own mind as he wrote, he may have given\r\nlight and shade which had caught his own fancy, and omitted the outlines\r\nwithout which the picture will be almost unintelligible.\r\n\r\nOf the many to whom he is indebted for assistance he feels called upon\r\nto mention specially the Secretary of State for War, by whose permission\r\nhe had unlimited access to the Ordnance Library in the Tower; Colonel\r\nMiddleton, C.B., Deputy Adjutant-General of the Royal Artillery; General\r\nMcDowell, commanding the troops in New York; Lieutenant A. B. Gardner,\r\nof the United States Artillery; and the Committees of the Royal\r\nArtillery and United Service Institutions.\r\n\r\nThe works which the author has consulted are too numerous to mention,\r\nbut among those which were most useful to him were Drinkwater's 'Siege\r\nof Gibraltar,' Murdoch's 'History of Nova Scotia,' Browne's 'England's\r\nArtillerymen,' Clode's 'Military Forces of the Crown,' the Reports of\r\nthe House of Commons, the Records of the Royal Military Academy, Kirke's\r\n'Conquest of Canada,' Rameau's 'La France aux Colonies,' Cust's 'Annals\r\nof the Wars.'\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the mass of MSS. through which he had to wade, the valuable\r\nmanuscript notes connected with the 'History of the Royal Artillery,'\r\narranged by the late Colonel Cleaveland, deserve special mention. The\r\nskeleton of this work, however, was furnished by the old Record Books of\r\nthe Battalions, deposited in the office of which the author is\r\nSuperintendent.\r\n\r\nIn the succeeding volumes, the advantage of being able to use the old\r\nletter-books of the head-quarter offices of the Royal Artillery will be\r\napparent. But there was no head-quarter staff for the Regiment up to the\r\ntime where this volume finishes; so that the student has, up to that\r\ndate, to depend greatly on men like General James Pattison and Forbes\r\nMacbean, who placed on record, in their diaries and letter-books,\r\nvaluable and interesting information connected with the Regiment during\r\ntheir service, which would otherwise have been hopelessly unattainable.\r\n\r\nThe value of such a History as this, if the writer has not utterly\r\nfailed in his object, cannot be better shown than in some words\r\naddressed by one of our most distinguished Artillery officers (Sir E. C.\r\nWarde) to an audience at the Royal Artillery Institution a few months\r\nago. The family affection which he urged as the model for Regimental\r\n_esprit_ cannot be better fostered than by reviving the stories of our\r\npredecessors' gallant deeds and scientific excellence. As a Regiment, we\r\nare now large almost to unwieldiness, and conflicting interests and\r\ntastes tend to diminish the desired sympathy and cohesion. And, as in\r\nthe crowded pit of a theatre before the performance commences, there is\r\nelbowing, and crowding, and wrangling for place, yet when the curtain\r\nrises all is hushed and quiet,—there is room for every one,—and the look\r\nof selfishness is exchanged for one of interest and pleasure,—so, among\r\nour great numbers, although there must be many and diverse interests and\r\ntastes, yet we all become as one as we gaze on the great dramas in which\r\nthose of us have acted who have gone before.\r\n\r\nThe words used by Sir Edward Warde were as follows:—\"It has ever been\r\nour pride, as a corps, to be regarded as one family; and if one member\r\nof it, in any remote part of the world, in any way distinguished\r\nhimself, it was felt universally that he had reflected credit and honour\r\non the whole corps. And so, _vice versâ_. Should we not, then, extend\r\nthose feelings as they apply to private families, in which members\r\nembrace _different_ professions? One becomes a soldier, another a\r\nsailor, a third enters the Church, a fourth goes up for the bar, and so\r\non; and if any one gain honour and distinction, all equally feel that\r\nsuch honour and distinction is reflected upon the whole family, and all\r\nequally glory and rejoice in it. So should it be with us. Some of us\r\ntake special interest in the _personnel_, as it is well known to you all\r\nthat I have done throughout my career; but is that any reason why I\r\nshould not take an interest—aye, and a warm interest—in the success of\r\nthose brother officers who pursue scientific researches, and seek honour\r\nand distinction in the pursuit of literature, and in endeavouring to\r\nraise the character of our corps as one from which highly scientific\r\nattainments are expected? No, indeed; the very reverse should be our\r\nguiding rule; and I can conceive no position more honourable than that\r\nheld for so many years by our highly distinguished brother officer, Sir\r\nEdward Sabine. Let us, then, feel that we _are_ one family, and let us\r\nrejoice in the success of every one of its members, whether they are so\r\nfortunate as to gain distinction in the field, in the siege, or in\r\nliterary and scientific pursuits; and by so doing may we hope, not only\r\nto maintain our present high reputation, but to increase it as time goes\r\non.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I.\r\n             THE MASTERS-GENERAL OF THE ORDNANCE AND THEIR\r\n                           HONOURABLE BOARD.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHERE are many reasons why the Masters-General of the Ordnance must\r\ninterest the student of the History of the Royal Artillery. In the days\r\nbefore the Regimental organization existed, all Artillery details came\r\nunder the care and superintendence of the Masters-General; and to a\r\ndistinguished one of their number does the Regiment owe its formation.\r\nThe interest becomes deeper and closer after that date; for in addition\r\nto the general superintendence which had already existed, the Master-\r\nGeneral had now a special interest in the Royal Artillery, in his _ex\r\nofficio_ capacity as its Colonel.\r\n\r\nAnd whatever objections may be urged against the Board of Ordnance, the\r\nRoyal Artillery, save in one particular, has always had abundant and\r\nspecial reason for regarding it with affection and gratitude. The almost\r\nfatherly care, even to the minutest details, which the Board showed to\r\nthat corps over which their Master presided, was such as to awaken the\r\njealousy of the other arms of the service. Had their government not been\r\nof that description which attempts to govern too much, not a word could\r\nbe said by an Artilleryman, save in deprecation of the day when the\r\nBoard of Ordnance was abolished. Unfortunately, like a parent who has\r\nfailed to realize that his children have become men, the Board\r\ninvariably interfered with the duties of the Artillery under whatever\r\ncircumstances its officers might be situated. No amount of individual\r\nexperience, no success, no distance from England, could save unhappy\r\nArtillerymen from perpetual worry and incessant legislation. The piteous\r\nprotests and appeals which meet the student at every turn give some idea\r\nof the torture to which the miserable writers had been exposed. The way,\r\nalso, in which the Board expressed its parental affection was often such\r\nas to neutralize its aim. It was rare indeed that any General Officer\r\ncommanding an army on service made an appointment of however temporary\r\nor trivial a nature, which had to come under the approval of the Board,\r\nwithout having it peremptorily cancelled. Even in time of peace, the\r\npresence in every garrison of that band of conspirators, known as the\r\nRespective Officers—who represented the obstructive Board, and whose\r\nopinion carried far more weight than that of the General commanding—was\r\nenough to irritate that unhappy officer into detestation of the\r\nHonourable Board and all connected with it.\r\n\r\nIt has been declared—and by many well able to judge, including the Duke\r\nof Wellington himself—that in many respects the Board of Ordnance was an\r\nexcellent national institution and a source of economy to the country.\r\nIt may be admitted that in its civil capacity this was the case, and the\r\nrecent tendency to revive in the army something like the Civil Branch of\r\nthe Ordnance proves that this opinion is general. But, if we take a more\r\nliberal view than that of mere Artillerymen, we must see that the\r\nmilitary division of its duties was only saved from exposure and\r\ndisgrace by the fact that the bodies of troops over which it had control\r\nwere generally small and scattered. The command of the Royal Artillery,\r\nnow that it has attained its present numbers, could not have remained\r\nvested in the hands of a Board constituted as the Board of Ordnance was.\r\nWhat General Officer could have hoped to weld the three arms of his\r\ndivision into any homogeneous shape, while one of them could quote\r\nspecial privileges, special orders, and sometimes positive prohibition,\r\nfrom a body to which they owed a very special obedience? The Royal\r\nArtillery may indeed have lost in little comforts and perquisites by the\r\nabolition of the Board of Ordnance, but in a military point of view, in\r\nproficiency, and in popularity, the Regiment has decidedly been a\r\ngainer.\r\n\r\nWhile admitting, however, the advantages, nay, the necessity of the\r\nchange which has taken place, the long roll of distinguished soldiers\r\nand statesmen who have successively held the office of Master-General of\r\nthe Ordnance is too precious an heirloom in the eyes of an Artilleryman\r\nto let pass without special notice and congratulation.\r\n\r\nFrom 1483, the earliest date when we can trace one by name, down to the\r\ndays of the Crimean war, when the last Master-General died in harness,\r\nthe brave, gentle Lord Raglan, the list sparkles with the names of men\r\nwho have been first in Court and field, and who have deserved well of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nTheir duties were by no means honorary in earlier times, although during\r\nthe last fifty years of the Board's existence the chief work fell upon\r\nthe permanent staff, and the visits of the Master-General were\r\ncomparatively rare and ceremonious. If any one would learn what they had\r\nto do in the seventeenth century, let him go to the Tower, and examine\r\nthe correspondence of Lord Dartmouth, the faithful friend and servant of\r\nCharles II., a professional Artilleryman and James II.'s skilled Master-\r\nGeneral to the last. He created order out of chaos in the Department of\r\nthe Ordnance, under Charles II., and so admirable were his arrangements,\r\nthat on King William ascending the throne, he issued a warrant ratifying\r\nall previous orders, and leaving the details of the management of the\r\nOrdnance unaltered. In the autumn of 1688, Lord Dartmouth's office—never\r\na sinecure—became laborious in the extreme. Daily and hourly\r\nrequisitions reached him from the excited King and his Ministers, for\r\nthe arming of the ships and the Regiments which were being raised in\r\nevery direction. Authority was given to raise more gunners, as if\r\nexperience could be created in a moment and the science of Artillery\r\nbegotten in a man's mind, without previous study, for \"twelve-pence by\r\nthe day.\" To Chatham the Master-General hurries to superintend the\r\nfitting-out of the men-of-war, and next day, for the same purpose, to\r\nSheerness, where he finds a despatch from the trembling Privy Council,\r\nordering him to fill six merchant ships with fireworks to accompany the\r\nKing's fleet, as fire-ships against the enemy. A terrible life did poor\r\nLord Dartmouth lead at this time. Sometimes his letters are written from\r\non board ship in the river, sometimes from his cabin in the\r\n'Resolution,' at Portsmouth; very frequently from Windsor, where James\r\nanxiously kept him near his person, plying him now with questions and\r\nnow with contradictory orders. Sometimes we find him writing at\r\nmidnight, ordering his loving friends, the principal officers of the\r\nOrdnance, to meet him next day at the Cockpit, in Whitehall; at other\r\ntimes he swoops down unexpectedly on the bewildered officials in the\r\nTower. In the old, quiet days, his correspondence was distinguished by\r\nan almost excessive courtesy; but now, in these days of fever and in the\r\ndepth of his anxiety, it almost disappears; orders are issued like\r\nminute-guns; explanations of delay are fretfully demanded; and a\r\nbombardment is incessant of peremptory inquiries as to the state of His\r\nMajesty's ships and stores.\r\n\r\nHis Lieutenant-General, Sir Henry Tichborne, has a hard place of it at\r\nthis time. With so energetic a Master at the Board, his work hitherto\r\nhas been of the lightest, and his head seems now to reel under the\r\nchange. For a few weeks he holds out, but by the end of November in that\r\neventful year matters came to a crisis with poor Sir Henry. He can no\r\nlonger attend the meetings of the Board; a violent fit of the gout\r\nprevents him, which he carefully warns his colleagues will, in all\r\nlikelihood, continue some time: and with a piteous prayer that, out of\r\nthe small sum in hand, the Board will pay the salaries of the \"poor\r\ngunners, as subsisting but from day to day,\" Sir Henry's name disappears\r\nfrom the Board's proceedings, and the History of the Ordnance knows him\r\nno more.\r\n\r\nAfter this time the Honourable Board seems, when its Master was absent,\r\nto have enacted the part of the Unjust Steward, for we find various\r\ndebts remitted to creditors who could not pay, and not a small issue of\r\ndebentures to those whose friendship it was desirable to retain. All\r\nthrough the records of their proceedings at this time is to be traced,\r\nlike a monotonous accompaniment in music, the work of that immovable\r\nbeing the permanent clerk. From the dull offices in the Tower issue the\r\nsame solemn Warrants, appointing this man an Ordnance labourer at six-\r\nand-twenty pounds a year, and that man a gunner at twelve-pence a day,\r\njust as if no Revolution were at hand, and no foreign foe were menacing\r\nthe very existence of their King and Honourable Board together. Lord\r\nDartmouth may be guilty of curt and feverish memoranda, but the\r\npermanent clerk never moves out of his groove, nor shall posterity ever\r\ntrace any uneasiness in his formal work.\r\n\r\nAnd then comes the sudden gap in all the books; the blank pages more\r\neloquent than words; the disappearance of the familiar signature of\r\nDartmouth; and the student takes up a fresh set of books where England\r\ntook up a fresh King.\r\n\r\nThe duties of the Master-General, and the various members and servants\r\nof the Board of Ordnance, were first reduced to a systematic form in\r\nCharles II.'s reign, while Lord Dartmouth was in office. The Warrant\r\ndefining these was confirmed by James II. on the 4th February, 1686; by\r\nWilliam III., on the 8th March, 1689; by Queen Anne, on the 30th June,\r\n1702; by George I., on the 30th July, 1715; and by George II., on the\r\n17th June, 1727.\r\n\r\nAlthough some alterations were made by George III., they were very\r\nslight, and rendered necessary by the occasional absence of the Master-\r\nGeneral and by the creation of the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich—\r\nthe Cadets attending that institution being placed in a very special\r\nmanner under the care and superintendence of the Master and Lieutenant-\r\nGeneral of the Ordnance. The orders under which the Board worked up to\r\nthe beginning of this century were, therefore, practically those\r\ninstituted during Lord Dartmouth's term of office; and in examining\r\nthem, one cannot fail to be struck with their exhaustive anticipation of\r\nevery circumstance which might arise for consideration.\r\n\r\nThe Master of the Ordnance, as he was originally called—sometimes also\r\ntermed the Captain-General of the Artillery—received, in 1604, the title\r\nof Master-General; and was considered one of the most important\r\npersonages in the realm. Since the great Marlborough held the office, it\r\nhas seldom been given to any one not already possessed of the highest\r\nmilitary rank: but this was not always the case. Lord Dartmouth was\r\nplain Colonel Legge when first appointed, and the social, as well as\r\nmilitary rank of his predecessors, was sometimes far from exalted. It\r\nbecame, therefore, necessary to attach to the office some relative\r\nmilitary status: and accordingly we find a Warrant issued by James II.,\r\nbearing date the 13th May, 1686, directing that the Master-General of\r\nthe Ordnance should always have \"the rank, as well as the respect, due\r\nto our youngest Lieutenant-General: and that our will and pleasure is,\r\nthat he command in our Garrisons as formerly, but do not take upon him\r\nthe charge or command as a Lieutenant-General in the field, without our\r\nespecial commission or appointment.\" The command in the Garrisons\r\nreferred to in the Warrant is in allusion to the Master-Gunners and\r\nGunners of the various Garrisons, whose allegiance to the Board of\r\nOrdnance, as being, in fact, custodians of the Ordnance Stores, was\r\nalways insisted on.\r\n\r\nThe relative rank awarded to the Master-General entitled him, when\r\npassing through any Camp or Garrison, to a guard of 1 officer, 1\r\nsergeant, and 20 men; the guards were compelled to turn out to him and\r\nthe drums to beat a march; and the officers and soldiers of the\r\nRegiments he passed had to turn out at the head of their respective\r\ncamps. In the old pre-regimental days, when the Master-General took the\r\nfield in time of war, in his official capacity, he was attended by a\r\nChancellor, thirty gentlemen of the Ordnance, thirty harquebusiers on\r\nhorseback, with eight halberdiers for his guard, two or three\r\ninterpreters, a minister or preacher, a physician, a master-surgeon and\r\nhis attendant, a trumpeter, kettledrums, and chariot with six white\r\nhorses, two or three engineers, or more if required, and two or three\r\nrefiners of gunpowder. These kettledrums do not seem to have been used\r\nin the field after 1748. They were used by the train of Artillery\r\nemployed in Ireland in 1689, and the cost of the drums and their\r\ncarriage on that occasion, was estimated at 158_l._ 9_s._ As the reader\r\ncomes to compare the wages of the drummer and his coachman—4_s._ and\r\n3_s._ per diem respectively—with the pay given to other by no means\r\nunimportant members of an Artillery train, he will realize what a\r\nprominent position these officials were supposed to hold. The drummer's\r\nsuit of clothes cost 50_l._, while a gunner's was valued at 5_l._ 6_s._\r\n4_d._ Even the coachman could not be clad under 15_l._—nearly three\r\ntimes the cost of a gunner's clothes.\r\n\r\nPrior to the date of King Charles's Warrant, the pay of the Master-\r\nGeneral had been very fluctuating, being considerably affected by fees,\r\nand even by sales of places in the department. By that Warrant, however,\r\nit was fixed at a certain sum, inclusive of all perquisites, and the\r\namount would appear to have been 1500_l._ per annum. This remained\r\nunchanged until the formation of the Cadet Company, when the annual sum\r\nof 474_l._ 10_s._ was added to the Master-General's salary, in his\r\ncapacity as Captain of the Company, and charged in the Regimental\r\naccounts of the Royal Artillery. Considerable strides in the direction\r\nof further augmentation were afterwards made, more especially in 1801,\r\nuntil we find Lord Chatham, in 1809, drawing no less than 3709_l._ per\r\nannum as Master-General of the Ordnance.\r\n\r\nThere was an order forbidding any increase to the establishment of the\r\nOrdnance without the King's sign-manual, but it speedily became a dead\r\nletter; and changes were frequently made without authority, involving\r\nadditional expense, and covered by something akin to supplementary\r\nestimates. In fact, the Parliamentary Commission which sat in 1810 to\r\ninquire into the various departments of the Ordnance ascertained that\r\nboth in matters of _personnel_ and _matériel_ the power of the Master-\r\nGeneral in his own department was simply unfettered. That it was not\r\nmore frequently abused speaks well for the honesty of the department,\r\nand the honour of its chief officers.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance at the meetings of the Board was\r\nlike the Deputy-Chairman of a Company. His powers were in abeyance when\r\nthe Master was present: although there were one or two cases in which\r\nhis signature was required as one of the quorum necessary to legalize\r\nthe business transacted. His office was created by Henry VIII., the\r\ndesignation of General being added subsequently. Until the days of Sir\r\nChristopher Musgrave he had an official residence in the Minories; and\r\non its being taken from him he received in lieu the annual allowance of\r\n300_l._ Another perquisite of the Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance was\r\nthe ground called, as the old deed expresses it, \"Y^e old Artillery\r\nGarden situate near y^e Spitle in y^e parish of St. Buttolph,\r\nBishopsgate:\" but this also being taken away from him, he was allowed,\r\nin March, 1683, the large manor-house and grounds commonly known as the\r\nTower Place at Woolwich, together with the Warren, &c., where the Royal\r\nArsenal now stands, a name given on the occasion of the visit paid to it\r\nby George III. in the spring of 1805. The use of this property by the\r\nLieutenant-General of the Ordnance was, however, trammelled by the\r\nfollowing conditions:—\"That the proving of great guns should go on as\r\nheretofore in Woolwich: that the Government should have full control\r\nover all wharves, magazines, cranes, &c., and that a dwelling for the\r\nMaster-Gunner of England should be allowed in the said Mansion-house,\r\nand lodging for ten fee'd gunners in the adjoining houses, and also for\r\nsuch Ordnance labourers as might be necessary.\"\r\n\r\nThe proper salary of the Lieutenant-General at first was 800_l._ per\r\nannum, supplemented, as mentioned above, by 300_l._ in lieu of a house;\r\nbut rising like the pay of the other officers of the Board, we find in\r\n1810, that it amounted to 1525_l._, besides an allowance for stationery.\r\nThe Parliamentary Committee which sat in 1810 and 1811 suggested the\r\nabolition of the office of Lieutenant-General—a suggestion which was\r\nultimately carried out in 1831. It was revived for a short time during\r\nthe Crimean war, Sir Hew Ross holding the appointment during the absence\r\nat the seat of war of the Master-General, Lord Raglan; but this was a\r\ncontingency which the Committee had foreseen, and was prepared to meet.\r\n\r\nIn examining the individual, apart from the collective, duties of the\r\nprincipal officers of the Ordnance, we find that the Lieutenant-General\r\nhad the supervision of the military branch, and acted as a sort of\r\nAdjutant to the Master, who looked to him for all information connected\r\nwith the various trains of artillery at the Tower and elsewhere. These\r\nhe was bound always to have fit and ready to march: he had to direct and\r\nsuperintend the practice of the Master-Gunner of England, Firemaster and\r\nhis mates, Fireworkers and Gunners, and acquaint the Master with their\r\nproficiencies; and also to see that all officials connected with the\r\nDepartment did their several duties.\r\n\r\nThe other four principal officers of the Ordnance were the Surveyor-\r\nGeneral, the Clerk of the Ordnance, the Storekeeper, and the Clerk of\r\nthe Deliveries, any three of whom formed a quorum. At the beginning of\r\nthe present century the salaries of these officials were respectively\r\n1225_l._, 825_l._, 725_l._, and 1000_l._ with a further annual sum of\r\n200_l._ to the Clerk of the Deliveries during war. The whole of the\r\nprincipal officers were allowed 25_l._ a year for stationery, besides\r\ncertain patent fees varying from 54_l._ 15_s._ in the case of the\r\nprincipal Storekeeper, to 18_l._ 5_s._ in that of the Clerk of the\r\nDeliveries. The departmental expenses were swollen by an army of public\r\nand private secretaries, clerks, and attendants.\r\n\r\nAs the work of the Lieutenant-General lay with the _personnel_, so that\r\nof the Surveyor-General lay with the _matériel_. On him lay the\r\nresponsibility of superintending all stores, taking remains, and noting\r\nall issues and receipts.\r\n\r\nThe Clerk of the Ordnance had, in addition to the ordinary\r\ncorrespondence of the department, to look after salaries, debts,\r\ndebentures, and bills falling due, and generally to perform, on a large\r\nscale, the duties of a modern book-keeper. If we may judge by the\r\ncorrespondence on financial matters which is to be found among the\r\nOrdnance Records, there must have been many a Clerk of the Ordnance\r\nwhose days and nights were haunted by visions of bills falling due which\r\ncould not be paid. During the times of the Stuarts, the poverty of the\r\noffice was sometimes as terrible as the shifts to which the Board had\r\nrecourse were pitiable.\r\n\r\nMoney seems to have been more plentiful during the reign of William\r\nIII.; but when Queen Anne came to the throne, England's continental wars\r\ndrained the Ordnance exchequer wofully; and while most of their debts\r\nwere only paid in part, many were never paid at all. An amusing incident\r\nof the Board's impecuniosity occurred in 1713. An expedition to Canada\r\nhaving taken place, the gunners and matrosses employed were found after\r\na time to be sadly in want of clothing. The Commissary of the Ordnance\r\non the spot, being without funds, drew a bill on the Honourable Board\r\nfor 140_l._, which instead of selling as usual to the merchants, he\r\ndisposed of to one of the gunners, apparently a man of means, and\r\ndestined ever after to be immortal, Mr. Frederick Price.\r\n\r\nThe bill, in due course, reached the Tower, but only two-thirds of the\r\namount were paid. Mr. Price naturally remonstrated; but as the\r\nproceeding seems not to have been unusual, the Board took no notice. So\r\nthe injured gunner petitioned the Queen, and a courteous letter from the\r\nTreasury speedily reached the Tower, in which a nice distinction was\r\ndrawn between Mr. Price's case and that of the merchants, who had been\r\nsimilarly treated, \"who had been great gainers as well by the exchange\r\nas by the stores and provisions which they had sold.\" The Board admitted\r\nthe force of the reasoning, and the creditor got his own again.\r\n\r\nThe duties of the storekeeper are expressed by his title, and involved\r\nclose and frequent personal inspection of stores, as well as great\r\nclerical labour.\r\n\r\nThe Clerk of the Deliveries had to draw all proportions for delivering\r\nany stores, and to keep copies of all orders or warrants for the\r\nproportions, and journals vouched by the persons who indented for them.\r\nHe had to compare monthly the indents taken for all deliveries of stores\r\nwith the Storekeeper's proportions; and had to attend, either in person\r\nor represented by one of his sworn clerks, at all deliveries of stores,\r\nand when taking _remains_ of ships.\r\n\r\nThe Treasurer of the Ordnance, who had to find heavy personal\r\nsecurities, was one of the most important of the remaining officers\r\nattached to the Board.\r\n\r\nSo much for the individual duties of the principal officers of the\r\nOrdnance, duties which, it must be admitted, were generally well and\r\nconscientiously performed. Their acts, in their collective capacity, are\r\nmore open to criticism. Although the Master-General could act\r\nindependently of the Board, when he chose, and had full power of\r\ndismissing or suspending any of the officers, reporting the same to the\r\nSovereign, he generally worked by means of the Board and, with his\r\nconsent, their acts were perfectly legal and binding without his\r\npresence. His personal influence appeared chiefly in matters of\r\npatronage and promotion, and, after the foundation of the Royal Military\r\nAcademy, it appeared in a very marked way in all matters connected with\r\nits government. But, with these exceptions, the actions of the Board\r\nwhich were most public, and call for most comment, are those which are\r\nto be traced to it in its collective capacity; and, as we shall see in\r\nthe course of this History, their joint acts were often characterized by\r\na pettiness, a weakness, and a blindness worthy of the most wooden-\r\nheaded vestry of the nineteenth century. It is marvellous how frequently\r\nmen who, when acting by themselves, display the utmost zeal and the\r\nstrongest sense of responsibility, lose both when associated with others\r\nfor joint action, where their individuality is concealed. The zeal seems\r\ninstantly to evaporate: their sense of justice gets blunted by the\r\ntraditions of the Board of which they have become members; and even the\r\nmost radical—after a few useless kicks and plunges—soon settles into the\r\ncollar, and assists the team to drag on the lumbering vehicle of\r\nobstruction and unreason. The power over a Board which is exercised by\r\nits permanent clerks is not the less tyranny because it is adroitly\r\nexercised, or because the tyrants are necessary evils. If an\r\n_individual_ is put at the head of a department, self-esteem assists a\r\nsense of duty in making him master the details, and ensure the proper\r\nworking of the machine. But when he finds himself merely one of several\r\nshifting and shadowy units whose individualities are lost, and whose\r\nfaults are visited upon an empty abstraction instead of on themselves,\r\nhe speedily in mere sympathy becomes like them; and, like them, he bows\r\nto the customs and precedents quoted by the permanent officials with an\r\nill-disguised contempt for those to whom these precedents are\r\nunfamiliar. Then follows the unresisting signature of documents placed\r\nbefore the Board by clerks who have no idea of anything beyond their\r\noffice walls—who imagine the world was created for them, not they for\r\nthe world, and who believe and almost say, that the very members of the\r\nBoard are there merely to be the channels of their offensive and\r\ndictatorial opinions. There has been in all ages in this country an\r\nofficialism which cannot look beyond the letter of the law, whose\r\nrepresentatives decline to enter into argument, to consider the\r\ncircumstances of a case, or to make allowance for emergencies:—whose\r\nminds prefer sinning in a groove to doing right out of it: and whose\r\nconduct would often appear malicious, were not malice too active a\r\nfeeling to enter into their cold and contracted bosoms.\r\n\r\nThis officialism was often rampant in the Ordnance; nor with the\r\nextinction of that Honourable Board can it be said to have vanished from\r\nEngland's administration.\r\n\r\nAs in the history of every corporation, there were at the Ordnance fits\r\nof economy and extravagance. The extravagance always began at the Tower,\r\nthe centre of the Board's official centre and kingdom; the economy away\r\nat the circumference, among poor gunners at distant stations, among\r\ndecaying barracks and fortifications crying out loudly for repair. It\r\nseems destined to be the motto of departments in every age, \"Charity\r\nbegins at home: economy abroad.\" After the peace of Utrecht, there was a\r\ndetermined resolution on the part of the Government to retrench,—a wise\r\nand praiseworthy resolution, if the method to be adopted were judicious.\r\nThe Treasury communicated with the Ordnance: and the Tower having made\r\nplausible promises to Whitehall, the Honourable Board met to see what\r\ncould be done. Starting with the official postulate, so characteristic\r\nof English departments, that their own salaries were to be untouched,\r\nthe field of their labour was in proportion contracted. Ultimately they\r\ndecided to economize in Scotland: they reduced all the stores there;\r\nvoted no money for the repair of the fortifications or barracks; and,\r\nregardless of past services, they reduced the gunners in various\r\ngarrisons.\r\n\r\nFrom the far north a plaintive appeal meets the student's eye. It is\r\nfrom one John Murray, who had been Master-Gunner of Fort William for\r\nnineteen years, and who in this fit of economy had been ruthlessly\r\nstruck off the establishment. Verily, ere many months be over, honest\r\nJohn shall have his revenge!\r\n\r\nFrom Scotland, the Board turned to the Colonies, and reminded them that\r\nthey must pay for their own engineers and gunners, if they wished to\r\nkeep them. A committee sat to inquire how the American dependencies\r\ncould be made to pay for themselves,—the beginning of that official\r\nirritation which culminated in the blaze in which we lost them\r\naltogether; and in the mean time demands for stores were neglected. One\r\nunhappy Governor wrote that he had under his command a company of troops\r\nwhich for fifteen years had received no fresh bedding: and \"many of the\r\nsoldiers were very ill, and in y^e winter ready to starve.\" A special\r\nmessenger was sent to lay the matter before the Board; but, he having\r\nbeen recalled by domestic reasons before succeeding in his prayer, the\r\nBoard adroitly pigeon-holed his petition for four years; and, in the\r\nlanguage of a subsequent letter, \"For want of bedding, many of y^e\r\nsoldiers have since perished.\"\r\n\r\nBut ere long came the inevitable swing in the other direction. Queen\r\nAnne died; King George had not yet landed at Greenwich; there was\r\nagitation and conspiracy among the adherents of the Stuarts, and\r\nScotland was simmering with rebellion. Then did the fearful Privy\r\nCouncil send letter after letter to the Ordnance urging them to find\r\narms for 10,000 men for Scotland, or for 5000, or even for 4000; but\r\nfrom their diminished stores even this small body could with difficulty\r\nbe armed. A train of artillery was ordered to march, and could not:\r\neverything was starved, and in chaos; and its commander, Albert Borgard,\r\nwrote, \"Things are in such confusion as cannot be described.\" Orders\r\nwere sent to man and defend Fort William, the now desolate scene of John\r\nMurray's nineteen years; and General Maitland, on reaching it, reported\r\nthat \"the parapets want repairing: there are no palisadoes; without an\r\nengineer to help me, I can but make the best of a bad bargain.\" He had\r\nto advance the money himself: \"Who pays me,\" he wrote, \"I know not.\" By\r\nnext messenger he asked for a little gunpowder, a few spades, pickaxes,\r\nand wheelbarrows, all rather useful articles in a fortification, but\r\nwhich had vanished under the breath of economy. There were no gunners,\r\nhe wrote, to work the guns; and he requested that the hand-grenades\r\nwhich were coming from Edinburgh might be filled and fitted with fuzes\r\nbefore they should be sent to him, \"for we have none here that\r\nunderstand this matter well.\" Of a truth, John Murray had his revenge!\r\n\r\nThe principal gate of the fortress was so rotten and shattered that it\r\ncould not be made use of, and was of no defence at all. There never had\r\nbeen any gate, the General wrote, to the port of the ravelin; and unless\r\nthe platform could be renewed, it would be impossible to work the guns.\r\n\"And,\" he adds in a well-rounded period, \"the old timber houses in which\r\nthe officers of the Garrison are lodged, and also the old timber\r\nchapell, are all in such a shattered pitifull condition, that neither\r\nthe first can be lodged in one, nor the Garrison attend divine service\r\nin the other without being exposed to the inconvenience of all\r\nweathers.\"\r\n\r\nNor was General Maitland singular. From Dumbarton Castle Lord Glencairn\r\nwrote to the Board, \"We not only want in a manner everything, but we\r\nhave not so much as a boat. And, besides, the Garrison wants near four\r\nmonths' pay.\" From Carlisle the Governor wrote that there were only four\r\nbarrels of powder in the garrison, a deficiency of every species of\r\nstores, and only four gunners, \"three of which are superannuated.\" Most\r\nof the gun-carriages were unserviceable, and the platforms wanted\r\nrepairing. There was haste and panic at Portsmouth, as empty stores and\r\nunarmed ships warned the Board what work there was before them. And from\r\nChester, Mr. Asheton, the zealous governor just appointed, reported,\r\n\"The guns are all here, but not the carriages, so that the stores, &c.,\r\nwould be of service—not prejudice—to an enemy.\" The only men there who\r\nwere capable of doing any work were forty _invalids_; and he therefore\r\nbegged for assistance in men and stores, \"in order\" he wrote, \"that I\r\nmay be capable of doing my country service by maintaining the rights of\r\nour gracious Sovereign King George against all Popish Pretenders\r\nwhatsoever.\"\r\n\r\nAs the guns of the Tower blazed out their welcome to the King, the smoke\r\nmust have clouded over such an accumulation of testimony in the Ordnance\r\noffices hard by, proving that there may be an economy which is no\r\neconomy at all, as might almost have penetrated the intelligence of a\r\nBoard. This period in the history of the Ordnance is unsurpassed, even\r\nby the many blundering times which, in the course of these volumes, we\r\nshall have to examine, down to that day in the year of grace 1855 when,\r\n\"from the first Cabinet at which Lord Palmerston ever sat as Premier,\r\nthe Secretary at War brought home half a sheet of paper, containing a\r\nmemorandum that the Ordnance—one of the oldest Constitutional\r\ndepartments of the Monarchy ... was to be abolished.\"[1]\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the Ordnance Board, its relations with the navy\r\nwere more intimate than in later years. The gunners of the ships were\r\nunder its control, and had to answer to it for the expenditure of their\r\nstores. In this particular, as in most details of checking and audit,\r\nthe Board was stern to a degree, and not unfrequently unreasonable. In\r\n1712, the captain of a man-of-war, sent to Newfoundland in charge of a\r\nconvoy, found the English inhabitants of the Island in a state of great\r\ndanger and uneasiness, and almost unprotected. At their urgent request,\r\nhe left with them much of his ordnance and stores before he returned to\r\nEngland. With the promptitude which characterized the Board's action\r\ntowards any one who dared to think for himself, it refused to pass the\r\ncaptain's or gunner's accounts, nor would it authorize them to draw\r\ntheir pay. Remonstrance was useless; explanations were unattended to:\r\nthe lesson had to be taught to its subordinates, however harshly and\r\nidiotically, that freewill did not belong to them, and that to assume\r\nany responsibility was to commit a grievous sin. It actually required a\r\npetition to the Queen and the Treasury before the unhappy men could get\r\na hearing, and, as a natural consequence, an approval and confirmation\r\nof their conduct.\r\n\r\nThe arming of all men-of-war belonged to the Ordnance; indeed, the\r\noffice was created for the Navy, although, in course of time, Army\r\ndetails almost entirely monopolized it. Although obliged to act on the\r\nrequisitions of the Lord High Admiral, their control in their own\r\ndetails, and over the gunners of the ship as regarded their stores, was\r\nunfettered. The repairing of the ships, and to a considerable extent\r\ntheir internal fittings, were part of the Board's duties; but it is to\r\nbe hoped that the technical knowledge of some of their officials\r\nexceeded that possessed by the Masters-General. A letter is extant from\r\none of these distinguished individuals, written on board the 'Katherine'\r\nyacht, in 1682, to his loving friends, the principal officers of the\r\nOrdnance. \"I desire\" he wrote, \"you would give Mr. Young notice to\r\nproceed no further in making y^e hangings for y^e great bedstead in\r\ny^e lower room in y^e Katherine yacht, till ye have directions from me.\"\r\n\r\nBut the Naval branch of the Board's duties is beyond the province of the\r\npresent work. Of the Military branch much will be better described in\r\nthe chapters concerning the old Artillery trains, the Royal Military\r\nAcademy, and in the general narrative of the Royal Artillery's existence\r\nas a regiment. A few words, however, may be said here with reference to\r\ntheir civil duties, once of vast importance, but, with the naval branch,\r\nswallowed up, like the fat kine of Pharaoh's dream, by the military\r\ndemands which were constantly on the increase, and were fostered by the\r\nmilitary predilections of the Masters and Lieutenants-General.\r\n\r\nThe civil duties have been well and clearly defined by Clode in his\r\n'Military Forces of the Crown,' vol. ii. He divides into duties—1. As to\r\nStores; 2. As Landowners; 3. As to the Survey of the United Kingdom; 4.\r\nAs to Defensive Works; 5. As to Contracts; and 6. As to Manufacturing\r\nEstablishments.\r\n\r\nOf the first of these it may be said that their system was excellent.\r\nPeriodical remains were taken (the oldest extant being dated April,\r\n1559), and a system of issues and receipts was in force which could\r\nhardly be improved upon.\r\n\r\nIn their capacity as Landowners, the members of the Board were good and\r\ncautious stewards; but as buyers of land, their characteristic crops up\r\nof thinking but little of other men's feelings or convenience. Perhaps\r\ntheir line of action in this respect can be best illustrated by an\r\nanecdote which comes down over many years in the shape of an indignant\r\nand yet pitiful remonstrance. It was in good Queen Anne's time, and the\r\nBoard had formed a scheme for fortifying Portsmouth. They appointed\r\nCommissioners to arrange the situation of the various works, and to come\r\nto terms with the landowners. These gentlemen did their duty; and, among\r\nothers, one James Dixon was warned that some land on which he had\r\nrecently built a brewhouse would be required for the Board's purposes. A\r\njury was empanelled, and assessed the value of the whole at 4000_l._\r\nWhen James Dixon built his brewhouse, he had borrowed money on mortgage:\r\nthe interest would, he believed, be easily paid, and the principal of\r\nthe debt gradually reduced by the earnings of the brewery. But after the\r\njury sat, not a drop of beer was brewed: no orders could be taken, with\r\nthe fear hanging over him that he must turn out at any moment; nor could\r\nhe introduce additional improvements or fixtures after the assessment\r\nhad been made, as he would never receive a farthing for them over the\r\nfirst valuation. Little knowing the admirable system of official\r\nmanagement in which an English department excels, he sat waiting for the\r\npurchase-money. One month passed after another: Christmas came, and yet\r\nanother, and another, and the only knocks at James Dixon's door were\r\nfrom the angry creditor demanding his money. At last, after waiting four\r\nyears,—the grey hairs thickening on the unhappy brewer's head,—the knock\r\nof a lawyer's writ came; and before the Master of the Rolls his\r\nmiserable presence and story were alike demanded. The narrative ends\r\nabruptly with a petition from him for six months' grace. Even then hope\r\nwas not dead in him; and he babbled in his prayer that \"he was in hopes\r\nby this time \"to have redeemed it out of the 4000_l._ agreed to be paid\r\ny^r Petitioner as aforesaid.\"\r\n\r\nIn the course of our story we shall find many such lives crushed beneath\r\nthe wheels of an official Juggernaut. Alas! that Juggernaut is still a\r\ngod!\r\n\r\n'The Survey of the United Kingdom' will be the most honourable vehicle\r\nfor transmitting to posterity the story of the Board's existence; for,\r\nalthough not yet completed, to the Board is due the credit of\r\noriginating a work whose national value can hardly be over-estimated.\r\nThe defensive works erected under the Ordnance already live almost in\r\nhistory, so rapidly has the science of fortification had to move to keep\r\npace with the strength of attack. Their contracts showed but little\r\nfavouritism, and, on the whole, were just: they included everything,\r\nfrom the building of forts to the manufacture of gunpowder and small\r\narms; and, in peace and war, they reached nearly over the whole\r\ncivilized world. With this extensive area came the necessity for\r\nrepresentatives of the Board at the various stations,—who were first,\r\nand wisely, civilians, three in number; afterwards, most foolishly,\r\nowing to the increasing military element at the Board, two soldiers, the\r\ncommanding officers of Artillery and Engineers, and one civilian. And as\r\nno man can serve two masters, it was soon apparent that the military\r\nmembers could not always serve their local General and their absent\r\nBoard; discipline was not unfrequently strained; jealousy and ill-will\r\nsupervened; and when the death of the Board sounded the knell of the\r\nRespective officers, as they were termed, there can be no doubt that it\r\nremoved an anomaly which was also a danger. Under the new and existing\r\nsystem, the commanding officers of Artillery and Engineers occupy their\r\nproper places: they are now the advisers of their General, not his\r\ncritics: and the door is opened for the entry of the officers of the\r\nscientific corps upon an arena where civilian traditions are unknown or\r\npowerless.\r\n\r\nOf the manufacturing departments of the Ordnance, what has to be said\r\nwill come better in its place in the course of the narrative.\r\n\r\nIn summing up, not so much the contents of this Chapter, which is\r\nnecessarily brief, as the study of the Board's history, the following\r\nare the ideas presented to the student's mind:—The Board of Ordnance\r\nformed a standard of political excellence,—which it endeavoured to\r\nfollow when circumstances permitted,—of financial and economical\r\nexcellence, which it planted everywhere among its subordinates for\r\nworship, but which was not allowed the same adoration in its own offices\r\nin the Tower. It saved money to the country legitimately by an admirable\r\nsystem of check and audit—illegitimately too often by a false economy,\r\nwhich in the end proved no economy at all; it obstructed our Generals in\r\nwar, and hampered them in peace: it was extravagant on its own members\r\nand immediate retainers to an extent which can only be realized by those\r\nwho study the evidence given before the Parliamentary Commission of\r\n1810-11. Jobbery existed, but rarely secret or underhand; and its\r\nextensive patronage was, on the whole, well and fairly exercised. And\r\nalthough every day shows more clearly the wisdom of removing from under\r\nthe control of a Board that part of our army, the importance of which is\r\nmade more apparent by every war which occurs, yet the Artilleryman must\r\nalways remember with kindly interest that it was to this board and its\r\ngreat Master (Marlborough) that his Regiment owes its existence, that to\r\nit we owe a nurture which was sometimes too detailed and careful, but\r\nunder which we earned a reputation in many wars; and that, after a long\r\npeace, it placed in the Crimea, for one of the greatest and most\r\ndifficult sieges in history,—difficult for other reasons than mere\r\nmilitary,—the finest siege-train of Artillery that the world has ever\r\nseen. In command of the English Army, during this war, the Board's last\r\nMaster died; and in the list which preceded him, and with which this\r\nchapter closes, will be found names which would almost atone for the\r\nworst offences ever committed by the Board over which their owners\r\npresided.\r\n\r\n\r\n              LIST OF THE MASTERS-GENERAL OF THE ORDNANCE.\r\n\r\nThe most recent list of these distinguished officials is that published\r\nin Kane's 'List of Officers of the Royal Artillery.' In it all the\r\nMasters before the reign of Henry VIII. are ignored, as being merely\r\ncommanders of the Artillery on expeditions or in districts. But this\r\nseems somewhat stern ruling. Undoubtedly Henry VIII. reorganized the\r\nOrdnance Department, and defined the position of the Master, as never\r\nhad been done before, and the sequence of the Masters from his reign is\r\nclear and intelligible. But before his time there were not merely\r\nMasters of the Ordnance on particular expeditions, but also for life;\r\nand there were certainly Offices of the Ordnance in the Tower. It has,\r\ntherefore, been thought advisable in the following list to prefix a few\r\nnames, which seem deserving of being included, although omitted in\r\n'Kane's List.'\r\n\r\nThe earliest of whom there is any record is\r\n\r\nRAUF BIGOD, who was appointed on 2nd June, 1483, \"for life.\" His life\r\ndoes not, however, seem to have been a very long one, for we find\r\n\r\nSir RICHARD GYLEFORD, who was appointed in 1485.\r\n\r\nSir SAMPSON NORTON was undoubtedly Master of the Ordnance, appointed in\r\n1513, as has been proved by extant MSS.\r\n\r\nThe next one about whom there is any certainty would appear to be the\r\none who heads 'Kane's List'—\r\n\r\nSir THOMAS SEYMOUR, who was appointed about 1537. Other lists show Sir\r\nChristopher Morris as Master at this time; but there seems little doubt\r\nthat he was merely Lieutenant of the Ordnance, although a distinguished\r\nsoldier, and frequently in command of the Artillery on service.\r\n\r\nIf one may credit 'Dugdale's Baronage,' the next in order was\r\n\r\nSir THOMAS DARCIE (afterwards Baron Darcie), appointed in 1545: but if\r\nso, he merely held it for a short time, for we find him succeeded by\r\n\r\nSir PHILIP HOBY, who was appointed in 1548.\r\n\r\n'Grose's List' and others interpolate Sir Francis Fleming, as having\r\nbeen appointed in 1547; but this is undoubtedly an error, and his name\r\nwisely rejected by the author of 'Kane's List,' where it is placed, as\r\nit should be, in the list of Lieutenants of the Ordnance. There is a\r\nfolio of Ordnance accounts still in existence, extending over the period\r\nbetween 29th March, 1547, and the last day of June, 1553, signed by Sir\r\nFrancis Fleming, as _Lieutenant_ of the Ordnance.\r\n\r\nThe next in rotation in the best lists is\r\n\r\nSir RICHARD SOUTHWELL, Knight, shown by 'Kane's List' as appointed in\r\nFebruary, 1554, and, by certain indentures and Ordnance accounts which\r\nare still extant, as being Master of the Ordnance, certainly in 1557 and\r\n1558.\r\n\r\nThe next Master held the appointment for many years. He was\r\n\r\nAMBROSE DUDLEY, Earl of Warwick, and can be proved from indentures in\r\nthe possession of the late Craven Ord, Esq., which are probably still in\r\nexistence, and from which extracts were made in 1820 by the compiler of\r\na manuscript now in the Royal Artillery Library, to have been appointed\r\non the 19th February, 1559, and to have held the office until 21st\r\nFebruary, 1589, over thirty years.\r\n\r\nPossibly owing to the difficulty of finding any one ready to undertake\r\nthe duties of one who had had so much experience—a difficulty which\r\noccurred more than once again—the office was placed in commission after\r\n1589, probably until 1596. From 'Burghleigh's State Papers' we learn\r\nthat the Commissioners were, the LORD TREASURER, the LORD HIGH ADMIRAL,\r\nthe LORD CHAMBERLAIN, and VICE-CHAMBERLAIN SIR J. FORTESCUE.\r\n\r\nOn 19th March, 1596, ROBERT, EARL OF ESSEX, was appointed Master of the\r\nOrdnance, and held the appointment until removed by Elizabeth, in 1600.\r\nNo record of a successor occurs until the 10th September, 1603, when\r\n\r\nCHARLES, EARL OF DEVONSHIRE, was appointed. He died in 1606, and was\r\nsucceeded by\r\n\r\nLORD CAREW, appointed Master-General throughout England, for life, in\r\n1608. He was created Earl of Totnes in 1625, and died in 1629. From a\r\nnumber of Ordnance warrants and letters still extant, there can be no\r\ndoubt that he held the office until his death. For a year after, until\r\n5th March, 1630, we learn, from the Harleian Manuscripts, that there was\r\nno Master-General. On that date\r\n\r\nHOWARD LORD VERE was appointed, and held office until the 2nd September,\r\n1634, when\r\n\r\nMOUNTJOY, EARL OF NEWPORT, was appointed.\r\n\r\nThen came the troubles in England—the Revolution, the Commonwealth, and\r\nat last the Restoration. Lord Newport seems to have remained Master-\r\nGeneral the whole time; for on Charles II. coming to the throne, he\r\nissued directions specifying, \"Forasmuch as the Earl of Newport may, by\r\nLetters Patent from our Royal Father, pretend to the office of our\r\nOrdnance, We, for weighty reasons, think fit to suspend him from said\r\ncharge, or anything belonging thereto; and Our Will is that you prepare\r\nthe usual Bill for his suspension.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd January, 1660, a most able Master-General was appointed,\r\nwhose place the King afterwards found it most difficult to fill. He was\r\n\r\nSir WILLIAM COMPTON, Knight, and he remained in office until his death.\r\nBy letters patent, on the 21st October, 1664, specifying that he had not\r\ndetermined with himself to supply the place of office of his Master of\r\nthe Ordnance, then void by the death of Sir William Compton, and\r\nconsidering the importance of his affairs at that time to have that\r\nservice well provided for, the King appointed as Commissioners to\r\nexecute the office of Master of the Ordnance\r\n\r\n JOHN, LORD BERKLY OF STRATTON, }\r\n\r\n Sir JOHN DUNCOMBE, Knight, and }\r\n\r\n THOMAS CHICHELEY.              }\r\n\r\nThis Commission lasted until the 4th June, 1670, when the last-named\r\nCommissioner (now Sir THOMAS CHICHELEY, Knight), was appointed Master of\r\nthe Ordnance, and in the warrant for his appointment, which is now in\r\nthe Tower Library, there is a recapitulation of the names of previous\r\nMasters, which includes one—placed between Sir Richard Southwell and the\r\nEarl of Essex—which does not appear in any other list, but which one\r\nwould gladly see included—\r\n\r\nSir PHILIP SIDNEY.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Sir Thomas Chicheley, the office was again placed in\r\nCommission, the incumbents being\r\n\r\nSir JOHN CHICHELEY, son of the late Master,\r\n\r\nSir WILLIAM HICKMAN, and\r\n\r\nSir CHRISTOPHER MUSGRAVE, the last-named of whom afterwards became\r\nLieutenant-General of the Ordnance. This Commission lasted from 1679 to\r\n8th January, 1682, when the celebrated\r\n\r\n\"GEORGE, LORD DARTMOUTH,\" became Master, having held the office of\r\nLieutenant-General under the Commission from 1st July, 1679, as plain\r\nColonel George Legge. He remained in office until after the Revolution\r\nof 1688, when he forfeited it for his adherence to the King. His\r\nsuccessor, appointed by William III. in 1689, and afterwards killed at\r\nthe Battle of the Boyne, rejoiced in the following sounding titles:\r\n\r\nFREDERICK, DUKE DE SCHOMBERG, Marquis of Harwich, Earl of Brentford,\r\nBaron of Teys, General of their Majesties' Forces, Master-General of\r\ntheir Majesties' Ordnance, Knight of the Most Noble Order of the Garter,\r\nCount of the Holy Roman Empire, Grandee of Portugal, General of the Duke\r\nof Brandenburg's forces, and Stadtholder of Prussia.\r\n\r\nAfter his death, the Master-Generalship remained vacant until July,\r\n1693, when it was conferred upon\r\n\r\nHENRY, VISCOUNT SIDNEY, afterwards Earl of Romney, who held it until\r\n1702. He was succeeded, almost immediately on Queen Anne's accession, by\r\nher favourite, the great\r\n\r\nJOHN, EARL OF MARLBOROUGH, who held the appointment until he fell into\r\ndisgrace with the Queen, when he resigned it, with his other\r\nappointments, on 30th December, 1711. He was succeeded by\r\n\r\nRICHARD, EARL RIVERS, who, after six months, was followed, on 29th\r\nAugust, 1712, according to the British Chronologist, or on the 1st July,\r\n1712, according to Kane's List, by\r\n\r\nJAMES, DUKE OF HAMILTON, who was killed in a duel in November of the\r\nsame year.\r\n\r\nFor two years the appointment remained vacant, but in 1714 it was again\r\nconferred upon\r\n\r\nJOHN, now DUKE OF MARLBOROUGH, who held it until his death, in 1722. He\r\nwas succeeded, as follows, by\r\n\r\nWILLIAM, EARL OF CADOGAN, on 22nd June, 1722, and by\r\n\r\nJOHN, DUKE OF ARGYLE AND GREENWICH, on 3rd June 1725.\r\n\r\nAt this period there is an unaccountable confusion among the various\r\nauthorities. The 'British Chronologist' and the 'Biographia Britannica'\r\nmake the list run as follows:—The Duke of Argyle and Greenwich was\r\nsucceeded, in 1740, by John, Duke of Montague, and resumed office again,\r\nfor three weeks, in 1742, when, for the last time, he resigned all his\r\nappointments, being again succeeded by the same Duke of Montague, who\r\ncontinued to hold the office until 1749, when he died.\r\n\r\n'Grose's List,' on the other hand, makes the Duke of Argyle's tenure of\r\noffice expire in 1730, instead of 1740, and makes no allusion to his\r\nbrief resumption of the appointment in 1742, and 'Kane's List' has\r\nfollowed this. It is possible that for the brief period that he was in\r\noffice the second time, no letters patent were issued for his\r\nappointment, which would account for its omission in most lists; but the\r\ndifference of ten years in the duration of the first appointment is more\r\ndifficult to account for. There is no doubt that, in 1740, the Duke of\r\nArgyle resigned all his appointments for the first time, but it is not\r\nstated whether the Master-Generalship was one, although it has been\r\nassumed. On the other hand, he might have been away during these ten\r\nyears to a great extent, or allowed his officers of the Ordnance to sign\r\nwarrants, thus giving an impression to the casual student that he no\r\nlonger held office. The manuscript in the Royal Artillery Library,\r\nalready referred to, bears marks of such careful research, that one is\r\ndisposed to adopt its reading of the difficulty, which is different from\r\nthat taken by Grose's and Kane's Lists, and agrees with the other works\r\nmentioned above.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of the Duke of Montague, the office remained vacant\r\nuntil the end of 1755, when it was conferred upon\r\n\r\nCHARLES, DUKE OF MARLBOROUGH, who held it until his death, on 20th\r\nOctober, 1758.\r\n\r\nDuring the vacancy immediately preceding the appointment of the last-\r\nnamed Master-General, Sir J. Ligonier had been appointed Lieutenant-\r\nGeneral of the Ordnance, and for four years had performed the duties of\r\nboth appointments,—acted as Colonel of the Royal Artillery, and Captain\r\nof the Cadet Company. A few months after the death of the Duke of\r\nMarlborough—namely, on the 3rd July, 1759—he was appointed Master-\r\nGeneral, being by this time\r\n\r\nFIELD-MARSHAL VISCOUNT LIGONIER. He was succeeded, on the 14th May,\r\n1763, by\r\n\r\nJOHN, MARQUIS GRANBY, who held it until 17th January, 1770, when we find\r\nthat he resigned all his appointments, except the command of the Blues.\r\nFor nearly two years the office remained vacant, and on the 1st October,\r\n1772, it was conferred upon\r\n\r\nGEORGE, VISCOUNT TOWNSHEND, whose tenure of office extended over nearly\r\nthe whole of that anxious period in the history of England which\r\nincluded such episodes as the American War of Independence and the great\r\nSiege of Gibraltar. The sequence of the remaining Masters may be taken\r\nfrom Kane's List, and is as follows:—\r\n\r\n      CHARLES, DUKE OF RICHMOND, K.G.  Appointed     1 Jan.  1782\r\n      GEORGE, VISCOUNT TOWNSHEND       Re-appointed  1 April 1783\r\n      CHARLES, DUKE OF RICHMOND, K.G.

Re-appointed  1 Jan.  1819\r\n      HENRY, MARQUIS OF ANGLESEY, K.G. Re-appointed  1 April 1827\r\n      VISCOUNT BERESFORD, K.G.         Re-appointed 28 April 1828\r\n      SIR JAMES KEMPT, G.C.B., G.C.H.  Re-appointed 30 Nov.  1830\r\n      SIR G. MURRAY, G.C.B., G.C.H.    Re-appointed 18 Dec.  1834\r\n      R. H., LORD VIVIAN, G.C.B.       Re-appointed  4 May   1835\r\n      SIR G. MURRAY, G.C.B., G.C.H.    Re-appointed  8 Sept. 1841\r\n      HENRY, MARQUIS OF ANGLESEY, K.G. Re-appointed  8 July  1846\r\n      HENRY, VISCOUNT HARDINGE, G.C.B. Re-appointed  8 March 1852\r\n      FITZROY, LORD RAGLAN, G.C.B.     Re-appointed 30 Sept  1852\r\n\r\nOn the abolition of the Board of Ordnance, the command of the Royal\r\nArtillery was given to the Commander-in-Chief of the Forces at that\r\ntime,\r\n\r\nFIELD-MARSHAL VISCOUNT HARDINGE, G.C.B. His successor (appointed Colonel\r\nof the Royal Artillery on the 10th May, 1861, and at this date holding\r\nthat office) was\r\n\r\nH.R.H. THE DUKE OF CAMBRIDGE, K.G., &c. &c., now Field-Marshal\r\nCommanding-in-Chief.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  Clode.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n                  THE INFANCY OF ARTILLERY IN ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE term Ordnance was in use in England before cannon were employed; and\r\nit included every description of warlike weapon. The artificers employed\r\nin the various permanent military duties were called officers of the\r\nOrdnance.\r\n\r\nThe first record of cannon having been used in the field dates from\r\nHenry III.; and with the increasing skill of the founders the use of\r\ncannon speedily became more general. But the moral influence of the guns\r\nwas far beyond their deserts. They were served in the rudest way, and\r\ntheir movements in the field and in garrison were most uncertain, yet\r\nthey were regarded with superstitious awe, and received special names,\r\nsuch as \"John Evangelist,\" the \"Red Gun,\" the \"Seven Sisters,\" \"Mons\r\nMeg,\" &c. In proportion to the awe which they inspired was the\r\ninadequate moral effect produced on an army by the loss of its\r\nartillery, or by the capture of its enemy's guns.\r\n\r\nIn the earliest days cannon were made of the rudest materials,—of wood,\r\nleather, iron bars, and hoops; but as time went on guns of superior\r\nconstruction were imported from France and Holland. The first mention of\r\nthe casting in England of \"great brass cannon and culverins\" is in the\r\nyear 1521, when one John Owen began to make them, \"the first Englishman\r\nthat ever made that kind of Artillery in England.\" The first iron guns\r\ncast in this country were made by three foreigners at Buckstead in\r\nSussex, in the year 1543. In this same year, the first shells were cast,\r\nfor mortars of eleven inches calibre, described as \"certain hollow shot\r\nof cast iron, to be stuffed with fireworks, whereof the bigger sort had\r\nscrews of iron to receive a match, and carry fire to break in small\r\npieces the same hollow shot, whereof the smallest piece hitting a man\r\nwould kill or spoil him.\" The following table[2] gives the names,\r\nweights, and charges of the guns which were in general use in the year\r\n1574. There were, in addition to these, guns called Curtals or Curtaux,\r\nDemicurtaux, and Bombards:—\r\n\r\n ──────────────────┬───────┬─────────┬───────┬─────────┬───────┬───────\r\n         NAMES.    │Weight.│Diameter.│Weight │Scores of│Charge │Height\r\n                   │       │         │  of   │Carriage.│  of   │  of\r\n                   │       │         │ Shot. │         │Powder.│Bullet.\r\n ──────────────────┼───────┼─────────┼───────┼─────────┼───────┼───────\r\n                   │ lbs.  │ inches. │ lbs.  │         │ lbs.  │inches.\r\n  1.

In the sixteenth century may be enumerated\r\nthe expedition to Flanders in 1511, in aid of the Duchess of Savoy; the\r\nSiege of Térouenne and Battle of the Spurs in 1513; the Siege of\r\nTournay; the Battle of Flodden Field, where the superior accuracy of the\r\nEnglish Artillery rendered that of the Scotch useless; the descent on\r\nthe coast of France and capture of Morlies in 1523; the Siege of Bray\r\nand Montedier in 1524; the siege of Boulogne in 1544; the expedition to\r\nCadiz under the Earl of Essex in 1596, and that to the Azores in 1597.\r\nIn the next century, daring the Civil War, and in all Cromwell's\r\nexpeditions, the use of Artillery was universal; and the part of the\r\ncentury after the Restoration will be alluded to in a subsequent\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nThe use, therefore, of Artillery by the English has existed for\r\ncenturies; but,—regarding it with modern eyes, its application would\r\nbetter deserve the term _abuse_. Nothing strikes the student so much as\r\nthe absence of the scientific Artillery element in the early trains; and\r\nthis feeling is followed by one of wonder at the patience with which our\r\nmilitary leaders tolerated the almost total want of mobility which\r\ncharacterized them. Not until the last decade of the eighteenth century\r\nwas the necessity of mobility officially recognized, by the\r\nestablishment of the Royal Horse Artillery; and it took half a century\r\nmore to impress upon our authorities that a Field Battery might not\r\nunreasonably be expected to move occasionally faster than a walk.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult, in reviewing such a period as the last fifteen years\r\nhave been in the history of Artillery in England—so full of improvements\r\nin every way—to single out any one of these as more worthy of mention\r\nthan the rest; but when posterity comes to review it dispassionately,\r\nthe improvement in equipment and mobility of our Field Artillery will\r\nmost probably be considered the prominent feature of the time. And these\r\nare the very qualities which for centuries remained in England\r\nunimproved and stagnant. The eighteenth century saw Artillery conducted\r\nby drivers, not under military discipline, nor marked by distinctive\r\ncostume; who not unfrequently fled with their horses during the action,\r\nleaving the gunners helpless, and the guns at the mercy of the enemy. In\r\nthis year, 1872, our drivers go into action unarmed, it being considered\r\nthat the possession of defensive weapons might distract their attention\r\nfrom their horses. But we do not commit the old error of using men not\r\nunder martial law. A driver who, on an emergency, finds himself with his\r\nwhip merely to defend him, may possibly feel aggrieved: but however far\r\nhe may run away, he cannot escape the embrace of the Mutiny Act, and is\r\nas liable to punishment as the man who deserts before the enemy, after\r\nhis country has sent him into the field armed from head to foot.\r\n\r\nIn the very earliest days of Artillery in England, the number of gunners\r\nborne on permanent pay on the books of the Ordnance bore a very small\r\nproportion to the artificers so borne. With the increasing use of\r\ncannon, an increase in the number of artillerymen took place, but by no\r\nmeans _pari passu_: and, as towns in England became gradually fortified,\r\na small number of gunners in each was found to be necessary to protect\r\nand take care of the stores, and to fire the guns on high days and\r\nholidays. In 1344, although no fewer than 321 artificers and engineers\r\nwere borne on the books of the Ordnance in time of peace, only twelve\r\ngunners and seven armourers appear. In 1415, at the Siege of Harfleur,\r\nthere were present 120 miners, 130 carpenters, and 120 masons; but only\r\n25 master, and 50 servitor gunners—the latter corresponding probably to\r\nthe matrosses of a later date. At the Siege of Tongue, in 1417, no less\r\nthan 1000 masons, carpenters, and labourers were present, but only a\r\nsmall number of gunners. At this time, the driving of the guns, the\r\nplacing them in position, and shipping and unshipping them, devolved on\r\nthe civil labourers of the trains, and there was a military guard to\r\nescort the guns on the march. The gunner's duty seems to have been a\r\ngeneral supervision of gun and stores, and the laying and firing it when\r\nin action. He was the captain of the gun in war—its custodian in peace.\r\nAfter the fifteenth century there was a marked increase in the number of\r\nartillerymen in the trains, although still totally inadequate. For\r\nexample, in the train ordered on service in France, in 1544, where the\r\ncivil element was represented by 157 artificers, 100 pioneers, and 20\r\ncarters, there were no less than 2 master-gunners, 264 gunners, and a\r\nspecial detachment of 15 gunners, for the guns placed immediately round\r\nthe King's tent. The principal officers of the Ordnance also accompanied\r\nthe expedition.\r\n\r\nThere was a distinction between the gunners of garrisons and those of\r\nthe trains, as regarded the source of their pay, or rather its channel.\r\nAt first, both were paid from the Exchequer; but after the proper\r\nestablishment of an Ordnance Department at the Tower, the gunners of the\r\nvarious trains were paid by it, the others receiving their salaries as\r\nbefore. The company of fee'd gunners at the Tower of London differed\r\nfrom the gunners of other garrisons in receiving their pay from the\r\nOrdnance directly. It must not be imagined, however, that the gunners of\r\ngarrisons were beyond the control of the Board of Ordnance because their\r\npay was not drawn on the Ordnance books. Not merely had the Master of\r\nthe Ordnance the nomination of the gunners of garrisons, but the power\r\nalso of weeding out the useless and superannuated. The instance given in\r\nthe Introductory Chapter of this volume, shows how directly they were\r\nunder the Board in matters of discipline; and although, as a matter of\r\nTreasury detail, their pay was drawn in a different department, a word\r\nfrom the Ordnance Office could stop its issue to any gunner in any\r\ngarrison who was deemed by the Board to have forfeited his right to it\r\nin any way. It was not until 1771, long after the formation of the Royal\r\nArtillery, that these garrison gunners were incorporated into the\r\ninvalid companies of the regiment; and at the present date they are\r\nrepresented by what is called the Coast Brigade of Artillery. The pay of\r\nthe old gunners of garrisons depended on the fort in which they resided.\r\nBerwick, for example, as an important station, was also one in which the\r\ngunner's pay was higher. In the reign of Edward VI. we find the average\r\npay of a master-gunner was 1_s._ a-day, and of the gunners, from 4_d._\r\nto 1_s._ Later, the pay of the master-gunner was raised to 2_s._ a-day,\r\nand that of the gunners rarely fell below 1_s._ In time of war, the pay\r\nof the gunners of the trains far exceeded the above rates. The senior\r\nmaster-gunner was styled the Master-Gunner of England. From 2_s._ a-day,\r\nwhich was the pay of this official in the sixteenth century, it rose to\r\n160_l._ per annum, and ultimately to 190_l._ His residence and duties\r\nlay originally in the Tower, and chiefly among the fee'd gunners at that\r\nstation; but after Woolwich had attained its speciality for Artillery\r\ndetails, quarters were allotted to him there in the Manor House. Among\r\nthe oldest Master-Gunners of England whose names are recorded may be\r\nenumerated Christopher Gould, Richard Webb, Anthony Feurutter[3] or\r\nFourutter,[4] Stephen Bull, William Bull, William Hammond, John Reynold,\r\nand John Wornn—all of whom held their appointments in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, and the majority of them by letters patent from Elizabeth. From\r\nthe fact that in the wording of their appointments two of the above are\r\nparticularized as soldiers by profession, it would appear that the\r\nothers were not so; and it is more probable that they were chosen for\r\ntheir knowledge of laboratory duties, and of the \"making of pleasaunt\r\nand warlike fireworks.\"\r\n\r\nThe company of fee'd gunners at the Tower, which might be supposed to\r\nhave had some military organization, really appears to have had little\r\nor none. Their number in Edward VI.'s reign was 58, with a master-\r\ngunner; but gradually it was increased to 100, which for many years was\r\nthe normal establishment. They were supposed to parade twice a week, and\r\nlearn the science of gunnery, under the Master-Gunner of England; but\r\ntheir attendance was so irregular, and their ignorance of their\r\nprofession so deplorable, that a strong measure had to be adopted, to\r\nwhich allusion will be made in a later chapter. Colonel Miller, in his\r\nresearches among the warrants appointing the gunners, found some\r\nvenerable recruits—who can hardly have been of much value in the field—\r\nof ages varying from sixty-four to ninety-two. There is no doubt that\r\nthese appointments were frequently sold, or given in return for personal\r\nor political services, without any regard to the capability of the\r\nrecipient. The clerks at the Ordnance Office had their fees for\r\npreparing these men's warrants, whose wording of the duties expected of\r\nthe nominee must have frequently read like a grotesque satire. The\r\nsituations were desirable because they did not interfere with the\r\nholders continuing to work at their trades near the Tower; and if the\r\ngunners were ordered to Woolwich for the purpose of mounting guns, or\r\nshipping and unshipping stores, they received working pay in addition to\r\ntheir regular salaries. It was from their ranks that the vacancies among\r\nmaster-gunners and gunners of garrisons were almost invariably filled.\r\n\r\nWhen a warlike expedition had been decided upon, the Master of the\r\nOrdnance was informed what size of a train of Artillery was required;\r\nbut he was permitted to increase or decrease its internal proportions as\r\nhe thought fit. To him also was left the appointment of all the officers\r\nand attendants of the train; and, with the exception of any belonging to\r\nthe small permanent establishment, it was understood that the services\r\nof any so appointed were only required while the expedition lasted. This\r\nspasmodic method of organizing the Artillery forces of this country was\r\nsufficient to account for the want of progress in the science of\r\ngunnery, and the equipments of our trains, which is apparent until we\r\nreach the commencement of the eighteenth century. But it took centuries\r\nof stagnation, and of bitter and shameful experience, to teach the\r\nlesson that Artillery is a science which requires incessant study, that\r\nsuch study cannot be expected unless from men who can regard their\r\nprofession as a permanent one, and the study as a means to an end; and\r\nthat, even admitting the possibility of such study being carried on by\r\nmen in the hope of occasional employment, it would be too theoretical,\r\nunless means of practice and testing were afforded, beyond the power of\r\na private individual to obtain. Nor could habits of discipline be\r\ngenerated by occasional military expeditions, which, to an untrained\r\nman, are more likely to bring demoralization; it is during peace-service\r\nthat the discipline is learnt which is to steady a man in the excitement\r\nand hardships of war.\r\n\r\nAs samples of the trains of Artillery before the Restoration, the\r\nfollowing, of various dates, may be taken: and an examination of the\r\nconstituent parts will well repay the reader.\r\n\r\nThe first is a train in the year 1544, already alluded to, and which was\r\ncommanded by the Master of the Ordnance himself, Sir Thomas Seymour.\r\n\r\n          1.

Nor are the proportions of the trains, and their\r\nconstituent parts, such as to enable us to draw any fixed law from them.\r\nThey are merely interesting—not very instructive. Table 1, on the other\r\nhand, is both interesting _and_ instructive. The appearance of medical\r\nofficers in the train of 1618, and of matrosses—a species of assistant-\r\ngunner—in that of 1639, will not have escaped the reader's notice.\r\n\r\nIn the next chapter we shall find that the presence of a man like Lord\r\nDartmouth, and his predecessor, Sir William Compton, at the Ordnance,\r\nreveals itself in the greater method visible in the Artillery\r\narrangements; and with the introduction of Continental artillerists,\r\nunder William III., comes a greater experience of the value of\r\nArtillery, which nearly brought about, in 1698, that permanent\r\nestablishment which was delayed by circumstances until 1716.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  This table is reproduced from the MSS. of the late Colonel Cleaveland.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  Feurutter, according to Colonel Miller.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  Fourutter, according to Colonel Cleaveland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n                THE RESTORATION, AND REVOLUTION OF 1688.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE first step, of course, on the restoration of Charles II., was to\r\nundo everything in the Ordnance, and remove every official bearing the\r\nmark of the Protectorate. Having filled the vacant places with his own\r\nnominees, he seemed to consider his duty done, and, with one exception,\r\nthe official history of the Ordnance for the next few years was a blank.\r\nThe exception was the Company of Gunners at the Tower, which from 52, in\r\n1661, rose to 90 in the following year, 98 in 1664, and then the old\r\nnormal number 100.\r\n\r\nBut the work in the Department done by the Master-General, Sir William\r\nCompton, although not of a demonstrative character, was good and useful,\r\nand prepared the way for the reformations introduced by his more able\r\nsuccessor, Lord Dartmouth. The Master-Gunners of England were now chosen\r\nfrom a higher social grade than before. In 1660 Colonel James Weymes\r\nheld the appointment, followed in 1666 by Captain Valentine Pyne, and in\r\n1677 by Captain Richard Leake. A new appointment was created for Captain\r\nMartin Beckman—that of Chief Firemaster. His skill in his department was\r\nrewarded by knighthood, and he held the appointment, not merely until\r\nthe Revolution of 1688, but also under William III., having apparently\r\novercome any scruples as to deserting his former masters. A Surveyor-\r\nGeneral of the Ordnance, Jonas Moore by name, was appointed in 1669, who\r\nafterwards received permission to travel on the Continent to perfect\r\nhimself in Artillery studies, for which purpose he received the sum of\r\n100_l._ a year.\r\n\r\nThe names of the Ordnance in the various fortifications in England\r\nduring the reign of Charles II. were as follows:—\r\n\r\n                            BRASS ORDNANCE.\r\n\r\n                  Cannon of 8.\r\n                  Cannon of 7.\r\n                  Demi-cannon.\r\n                  24 prs.\r\n                  Culverings.\r\n                  12 prs.\r\n                  Demi-culverings.\r\n                  8 prs.\r\n                  6 prs.\r\n                  Sakers.\r\n                  Mynions.\r\n                  3 prs.\r\n                  Falcon.\r\n                  Falconett.\r\n                  Brass baces of 7 bores.\r\n                  Inch and ¼ bore, and 7 other sizes.\r\n\r\n                            IRON ORDNANCE.\r\n\r\n                  Cannon of 7.\r\n                  Demi-cannon.\r\n                  24 prs.\r\n                  Culverings.\r\n                  12 prs.\r\n                  Demi-culverings.\r\n                  8 prs.\r\n                  6 prs.\r\n                  Sakers.\r\n                  Mynions.\r\n                  3 prs.\r\n                  Falcon.\r\n                  Falconett.\r\n                  Rabonett.\r\n\r\n                          BRASS MORTAR PIECES.\r\n\r\n                  18½ in.[5]\r\n                  16½ in.\r\n                  13¼ in.\r\n                  9 in.\r\n                  8¾ in.\r\n                  8 in.\r\n                  7¾ in.\r\n                  7¼ in.\r\n                  6½ in.\r\n                  6¼ in.\r\n                  4½ in.\r\n                  4¼ in.\r\n\r\n                          IRON MORTAR PIECES.\r\n\r\n                  12½ in.\r\n                  4¼ in.\r\n\r\n                                            _Taken from Harl. MS. 4244._\r\n\r\nThe reader will observe the immense varieties of mortars, and the large\r\ncalibres, compared with those of the present day. They were much used on\r\nboard the bomb-vessels; but it is difficult to see the advantage of so\r\nmany small mortars, varying so slightly in calibre.\r\n\r\nFrom an account of some new ordnance made in 1671, we find that iron\r\ncannon of 7 were 10 feet long, and weighed on an average 63 cwt., or 9½\r\nfeet long, and weighing from 54 cwt. to 60 cwts. Iron culverings of 10\r\nfeet in length averaged 43 cwt. in weight, and demi-culverings of the\r\nsame length averaged in weight about 35 cwt. Iron falconetts are\r\nmentioned 4 feet in length, and weighing from 300 to 312 lbs.\r\n\r\nThe King, having occasion to send a present to the Emperor of Morocco,\r\nnot an unfrequent occurrence, selected on one occasion four iron demi-\r\nculverings, and three brass demi-cannon of 8½ feet long, with one brass\r\nculvering of 11½ feet. A more frequent present to that monarch was\r\ngunpowder, or a quantity of muskets.\r\n\r\nThe salutes in the Tower were fired from culverings and 8-pounders, and\r\nwere in a very special manner under the command of the Master-General\r\nhimself. As little liberty of thought was left to the subordinates at\r\nthe Tower as possible. Warnings of preparation were forwarded often days\r\nbefore, followed at intervals by reminders that the salute was not to be\r\nfired until a positive order should reach the Tower from the Master-\r\nGeneral.\r\n\r\nThe letter-books at the Tower teem with correspondence and orders on\r\nthis subject, and the Master-General seemed to write as many letters to\r\nhis loving friends at the Tower about a birthday salute, about which no\r\nmistake could well occur, as he did about a salute of another kind,\r\nalbeit a birthday one, when on the 10th June, 1688, \"it pleased Almighty\r\nGod, about ten o'clock of the morning, to bless his Majesty and his\r\nRoyal Consort, the Queen, with the birth of a hopefull son, and his\r\nMajesty's kingdom and dominions with a Prince: for which inestimable\r\nblessing\" public rejoicing was invited. It was a false tale which the\r\nguns rang out from the Tower:—only a few months, and the hopeful babe\r\nwas a fugitive with its ill-fated father, and remained an exile for his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n  \"He was indeed the most unfortunate of Princes, destined to seventy-\r\n  seven years of exile and wandering, of vain projects, of honours\r\n  more galling than insults, and hopes such as make the heart\r\n  sick.\"[6]\r\n\r\nAt this time, Woolwich was gradually increasing in importance as an\r\nArtillery Depôt, and in 1672 the beginning of the Laboratory was laid,\r\n70 feet long, \"for receiving fireworks.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1682 Lord Dartmouth was appointed Master-General, and from this date\r\nuntil the Revolution the student of the Ordnance MSS. recognizes the\r\nexistence of a master-spirit, and a clear-headed man of business. In\r\n1683 he obtained authority from the King to reorganize the whole\r\ndepartment, and define the duties of every official—a task which he\r\nperformed so well that his work remained as the standard rule for the\r\nBoard until it ceased to exist. His physical activity was as great as\r\nhis mental: not a garrison in the kingdom was safe from his personal\r\ninspection; and the results of his examination were so eminently\r\nunsatisfactory as to call forth orders which, while calculated to\r\nprevent, had the effect also of revealing to posterity abuses of the\r\ngrossest description. Not merely was neglect discovered among the\r\nstorekeepers and gunners of the various garrisons—not merely ignorance\r\nand incapacity—but it was ascertained to be not unusual for a Master-\r\nGunner to omit reporting the death of his subordinates, while continuing\r\nhowever to draw their pay. Lord Dartmouth's measures comprised the\r\nweeding out of the incapable gunners; the issue of stern warnings to\r\nall; the bringing the Storekeepers (who had hitherto held their\r\nappointments by letters patent from the Exchequer) under the immediate\r\njurisdiction of the Board of Ordnance; the increase of the more educated\r\nelement among the few Artillerymen on the permanent establishment, by\r\nthe appointment of Gentlemen of the Ordnance, \"lest the ready effects of\r\nour Artillery in any respect may perhaps be wanting when occasion shall\r\nbe offered;\" the appointment of Engineers to superintend the\r\nfortifications, with salaries of 100_l._ a year, under a Chief Engineer,\r\nSir Bernard de Gomme; the encouragement of foreign travel and study; and\r\nthe creation of discipline among the gunners at the Tower. Among the\r\nvarious causes of regret which affected Lord Dartmouth after the\r\nRevolution, probably none were more felt than the sorrow that he had\r\nbeen unable to complete the reformation in the Ordnance which he had so\r\nthoroughly and ably commenced.\r\n\r\nAs a specimen of a train of Lord Dartmouth's time may be taken the one\r\nordered to march on 21st June, 1685, to join Lord Feversham's force at\r\nChippenham, and to proceed against the rebels. It consisted of\r\n\r\n                                                          Pay per diem.\r\n                                                            £ _s._ _d._\r\n Comptroller                                                0   15    0\r\n   His clerk                                                0    3    0\r\n Commissary of the Artillery                                0   10    0\r\n   His two clerks                                           0    6    0\r\n Paymaster of the Train                                     0    8    0\r\n   His clerk                                                0    3    0\r\n Master of the Waggons                                      0   10    0\r\n   Two assistants                                           0    8    0\r\n Commissary of the draught horses                           0    8    0\r\n   Two assistants                                           0    8    0\r\n Gentlemen of the Ordnance, three at 5_s._ each             0   15    0\r\n Purveyor                                                   0    5    0\r\n Provost-Marshal                                            0    6    0\r\n   Two assistants                                           0   10    0\r\n Master-Gunner                                              0    5    0\r\n   Two Mates at 3_s._                                       0    6    0\r\n   32 Gunners at 2_s._                                      3    4    0\r\n   32 Matrosses at 1_s._ 6_d._                              2    8    0\r\n   Conductors, six at 2_s._ 6_d._                           0   15    0\r\n Chirurgeon                                                 0    4    0\r\n   His Mate                                                 0    2    6\r\n Tent-keeper                                                0    4    0\r\n   His assistant                                            0    1    6\r\n Master-Smith                                               0    4    0\r\n   Two Smiths                                               0    4    0\r\n One Farrier                                                0    2    6\r\n Master-Carpenter                                           0    3    0\r\n   Four Carpenters at 2_s._ each                            0    8    0\r\n Master-Wheelwright                                         0    3    0\r\n   Two Wheelers                                             0    4    0\r\n Master Collar-Maker                                        0    3    0\r\n   One Collar-maker                                         0    2    0\r\n Master-Cooper                                              0    2    6\r\n   Gunsmith                                                 0    1    6\r\n Captain of the Pioneers                                    0    4    0\r\n   One Sergeant                                             0    2    0\r\n   One Corporal                                             0    1    6\r\n   One Drummer                                              0    1    0\r\n   20 Pioneers                                              1    0    0\r\n   118 Drivers at 1_s._ each                                5   18    0\r\n                                                          ———   ——   ——\r\n                 Total per diem                           £22    9    0\r\n                                                          ———   ——   ——\r\n\r\nThe guns used were brass Falcons and iron 3-pounders.\r\n\r\nOn examining the comparative pay of the various ranks, the Provost-\r\nMarshal seems to be well paid, ranking as he does in that respect with\r\nthe Surgeon, and the Captain of the Pioneers. But if we may judge of the\r\ndiscipline of his train from one incident which has survived, his office\r\ncan have been no sinecure. We find on the 23rd December, 1685, the King\r\nand Privy Council assembled at Whitehall, discussing gravely some\r\nconduct of certain members of the train, which had formed matter of\r\ncomplaint and petition from his Majesty's lieges. Four unhappy farmers\r\nhad had a yoke of oxen pressed from each—the day after the rebels had\r\nbeen defeated—to bring off the carriages of the King's train of\r\nArtillery (then immovable, as might have been expected), and the animals\r\nhad been made to travel as far as Devizes, forty miles from their home.\r\nOne of the farmers, William Pope by name, had accompanied the train, in\r\norder that he might bring the oxen back. On applying for them at the end\r\nof the journey, the conductor \"did abuse William Pope, one of the\r\npetitioners, by threatening to hang him for a rebel, as in the petition\r\nis more at large set forth.\" So the farmers now prayed to have their\r\noxen, with the yokes and furniture, or their value, restored to them.\r\n\r\nAs the King in Council was graciously pleased to refer the complaint to\r\nLord Dartmouth, with a view to justice being done, the reader need not\r\ndoubt that the petitioners went away satisfied.\r\n\r\nThe details, contained in the Ordnance books, of the camp ordered by the\r\nKing in 1686 to be formed at Hounslow, give the first intimation of that\r\ndistribution of the Artillery of an Army, known as Battalion guns, a\r\nsystem which lasted in principle until 1871, although the guns ceased to\r\nbe subdivided in such small divisions a good many years before. As,\r\nhowever, until 1871, the batteries had to accommodate themselves to the\r\nmovements of the battalions near them, it may be said with truth that\r\nuntil then they were really Battalion guns. James II. ordered fourteen\r\nregiments to encamp at Hounslow with a view to overawing the disaffected\r\npart of the populace; but the effect was to reveal instead the\r\nunmistakable sympathy which existed between the troops and the people;\r\nso the camp was abruptly broken up. The Battalion guns were brass 3-\r\npounders, under Gentlemen of the Ordnance, with a few other attendants,\r\nand escorted _to their places by the Grenadiers of the various\r\nRegiments_. Two demi-culverins of 10 feet in length, and six small\r\nmortar pieces, were also sent from the Tower to the camp.\r\n\r\nIn 1687, uneasiness was felt about Ireland, and large quantities of\r\nstores were assembled at Chester, for ready transit to that country if\r\nrequired. A large issue of mortars for that service was also made, the\r\ncalibres being 14¼, 10, and 7 inches, and the diameters of the shells\r\nbeing respectively a quarter of an inch less. Among other guns which\r\noccur by name in the Ordnance lists of this year, and which have not yet\r\nbeen mentioned, are culverin drakes of 8 feet in length; saker-drakes of\r\nthe same; and saker square guns also 8 feet long.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1688, his fatal year, King James was advised by Lord\r\nDartmouth to send a young Gentleman of the Ordnance to Hungary to the\r\nEmperor's camp to improve himself in the art military, \"to observe and\r\ntake notice of their method of marching, encamping, embattling,\r\nexercising, ordering their trains of Artillery, their manner of\r\napproaching, besieging, or attacking any town, their mines, Batteries,\r\nlines of circumvallation and contravallation, their way of\r\nfortification, their foundries, instruments of war, engines, and what\r\nelse may occur observable; and for his encouragement herein he was\r\nallowed the salary of 1_l._ per diem, besides such advance as was\r\nconsidered reasonable.\"\r\n\r\nA long and difficult lesson was this which Richard Burton had to learn,\r\nand ere it should be mastered the Sovereign who encouraged him should be\r\ngone from Whitehall.\r\n\r\nIt was on the 15th of October, 1688, that undoubted advice reached the\r\nKing that \"a great and sudden invasion, with \"an armed force of\r\nforeigners, was about to be made, in a hostile manner, upon his\r\nkingdom;\" and although it is not contemplated to describe the campaigns\r\nof the pre-regimental days, a description of the train of Artillery with\r\nwhich he proposed to meet the invasion, and which was prepared for the\r\npurpose, cannot fail to be interesting. It is the most largely officered\r\ntrain which we have as yet met; and it was announced that, should the\r\nKing accompany it at any time himself, it should be further increased by\r\nthe presence of the Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance, the Comptroller-\r\nGeneral, the Principal Engineer, the Master-Gunner of England and his\r\nClerks, the Chief Firemaster and his Mate, the Keepers and Makers of the\r\nRoyal Tents and their Assistants. Exclusive of these, whose presence was\r\nconditional, the following was the _personnel_ of\r\n\r\n\r\n     _James II.'s Artillery Train to Resist the Invasion of 1688_.\r\n\r\nThe reader will observe that in this train the Master-General is not\r\nincluded, even in the contingency of the King's accompanying it himself.\r\nLord Dartmouth had another duty to perform. He had been appointed\r\nAdmiral of the Fleet which was to engage, if possible, the immense\r\nnumber of vessels which accompanied William to England. The winds fought\r\nagainst Dartmouth. First, he was kept at the mouth of the Thames by the\r\nsame east winds that wafted the enemy to their landing-place at Torbay;\r\nand when, at last, able with a fair wind to follow down the Channel in\r\npursuit, just as he reached Portsmouth, the wind changed: he had to run\r\ninto that harbour, and his opportunity was lost—an opportunity, too,\r\nwhich might have reversed the whole story of the Revolution, for there\r\nwas more loyalty to the King in the navy than in the army,—a loyalty\r\nwhich was whetted, as Macaulay well points out, by old grudges between\r\nthe English and Dutch seamen; and there was in James's Admiral an\r\nability and an integrity which cannot be doubted. Had the engagement\r\ntaken place, and the King's fleet been successful, it does not require\r\nmuch experience of the world's history to say that the Revolution would\r\nhave been postponed for years, if not for ever, for it is marvellous how\r\nloyal waverers become to the side which has the first success. Nor is\r\nthis the first or only case on which a kingdom, or something equally\r\nvaluable, has hung upon a change of wind.

The surgeon ranked with the ladle-maker, the chief artificers, and\r\nthe messenger; while his assistant received the same remuneration for\r\nhis services as did the servants of the master wheelwright and master\r\ncooper. The presence, in this train, of an Adjutant and a Battery\r\nMaster, is worthy of note, and also the intimation that then, as now, on\r\nservice, the Artillery had to take their share in the transport of the\r\nsmall-arm ammunition of the Army.\r\n\r\nHistory moved rapidly now. After James's flight and a brief interregnum,\r\nthe Ordnance Office moves on again with spirit under the new Master-\r\nGeneral, the Duke de Schomberg. Judging from the vigorous conduct\r\ndisplayed by him during his brief career at the Board, one cannot but\r\nregret that it was so soon cut short. One little anecdote reveals the\r\nenergy of the man's character, and enlists the sympathy of that part of\r\nposterity—and the name is Legion!—which has suffered from red tape and\r\nroutine. There was naturally a strong feeling in Scotland against the\r\nnew King. Presbyterianism itself could not dull the beating of the\r\nnational heart, which was moved by the memories of the old line of\r\nMonarchs which had been given to England, whose gracious ways almost\r\ncondoned their offences, and whose offences were easily forgotten in\r\nthis their hour of tribulation.\r\n\r\nMen, guns, ammunition, and transport were all required for Edinburgh and\r\nBerwick; but between the demand and the supply stood that national\r\nbuffer which seems to be England's old man of the sea—a public\r\ndepartment. For transport the Master-General had to consult the\r\nAdmiralty, who, being consulted, began to coil the red tape round the\r\nMaster's neck, and nothing more. He entreats, implores, and prays for\r\neven one ship to carry special engineers and messages to the Forth; but\r\nthe Admiralty quietly pigeon-holes his prayers in a style worthy of two\r\ncenturies later. The Duke will have none of it: he writes to the Board\r\nto give up this useless correspondence with a wooden-headed Department;\r\nto take his own private yacht, and carry out the King's service, without\r\ndelay. Would that, to every wearied postulant, there were a private\r\nyacht to waft him out of the stagnant pool which officialism considers\r\nthe perfection of Departmental Management, and in which he might drift\r\naway from the very memory of pigeon-holes and precedents!\r\n\r\nAs might be expected, volumes of warrants, at this time, reveal the\r\nchanges made among the officials of the Ordnance. The preparing of a\r\nwarrant implied a fee; it is not to be wondered at, therefore, that they\r\nwere many. No office under the Ordnance was too low to escape the\r\nnecessity of a warrant. There were chimney-sweeps to the Ordnance who\r\nhave been made immortal by this necessity, paviours, druggists,\r\nmessengers, and labourers. All must be made public characters, because\r\nall must pay. Sex is no protection. Candidates for Ordnance appointments\r\nwho belong to the fair sex cannot plead shyness and modesty in bar of\r\ntheir warrants. So that Mary Pickering, who was reappointed _cooper_ at\r\nthe Fort of Upnor, near Chatham, and Mary Braybrooke, appointed _turner_\r\nat the same time, have come down to posterity for the fee of ten\r\nshillings, when fairer and nobler maidens have been forgotten.\r\n\r\nThere are many Dutch, German, and even French names among the new\r\nofficials appointed for the Board's service. But reappointments are, by\r\nno means, rare, if the old incumbents would but change their allegiance.\r\nAmong the changes introduced by the Duke de Schomberg was one by which\r\nnot merely were there gentlemen of the Ordnance for the Tower and the\r\nvarious trains, but also \"for the out parts:\" and if there were no\r\nheavier duties for them to perform than those specified in their\r\nwarrants, they must have had a very easy time of it, and earned their\r\nforty pounds a year without much labour. According to their warrants,\r\ntheir duty was to see that \"all y^e aprons, beds, and coynes belonging\r\nto their Majesties' Traynes of Artillery at y^e outposts do remain upon\r\nthe guns and carriages.\" If this were really all they had to do, the old\r\ngunners of garrisons might have done it quite as well for half the\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of getting arms for the troops which were being raised\r\nfor service in Ireland alarmed the Board greatly. Very strong measures\r\nhad to be taken: penalties were threatened on every one who kept arms\r\nconcealed, or failed to bring them to the Board; and a house-to-house\r\nsearch was authorized. Gunsmiths were forbidden to sell to private\r\nindividuals, and commanded to devote all their energies to manufacturing\r\narms for the Board, and yet the need was sore. Horses, also, had to be\r\nbought, and could with difficulty be obtained; and such as were procured\r\ncould not bear the test of examination. So bad were they, that at last\r\nthe Master-General inspected in person not merely the horses bought for\r\nthe Artillery, but also the persons who bought them. At his first\r\ninspection he found them all faulty—rejecting some because they were too\r\nslight, some because they were lame, and one because it was an old\r\ncoach-horse. With the difficulty of getting horses came also the\r\ndifficulty of procuring forage. The contract for the horses of the\r\nTraynes for Chester and Ireland reached the unprecedented sum of fifteen\r\npence per horse for each day.\r\n\r\nTo add to the other troubles of the new Board, the Chief Firemaster and\r\nEngineer (Sir Martin Beckman), with all the keenness and zeal of a\r\nrenegade, kept worrying it about the state of the various Forts and\r\nBarracks; whose defects, he assured the Board, he had repeatedly urged\r\non the two preceding monarchs, but without avail, on account of the\r\ndeficiency of funds. \"Berwick,\" he begged to assure the Board, \"is\r\ngetting more defenceless every year, and will take 31,000_l._ to be\r\nspent at once to prevent the place from being safely insulted.\" For six\r\nyears past he assured the Board that Hull had been going to ruin: the\r\nearthworks had been abused by the garrison, who had suffered all sorts\r\nof animals to tread down the facings, and had, in the night-time, driven\r\nin cattle, and made the people pay money before they released them; and\r\nwhen they turned the cattle and horses out, they drove them through the\r\nembrasures and portholes, and so destroyed the facings, that, without\r\nspeedy repair and care, his Majesty would certainly be obliged to make\r\nnew ones.\r\n\r\nThe bomb-vessels also occupied the attention of the Board. More\r\npractical Artillerymen were required than could be granted without\r\ngreatly increasing the permanent establishment. So a compromise was\r\nmade; and a number of men were hired and appointed _practitioner_\r\nbombardiers, at the same rate of pay as others of the same rank, viz.\r\n2_s._ per diem, but with the condition that the moment their services\r\nwere no longer required they would be dispensed with.\r\n\r\nThere were calls, also, from the West Indies on the sore-pressed Board.\r\nA train of brass Ordnance was sent there, to which were attached the\r\nfollowing, among other officials:—A Firemaster, at 10_s._ a day; a\r\nMaster-Gunner, at 5_s._; Engineers, at various rates, but generally\r\n10_s._, who were ordered to send home frequent reports and sketches;\r\nBombardiers, at 2_s._ 6_d._; and a proportion of Gunners and Matrosses,\r\nat 2_s._ and 1_s._ 6_d._ per diem respectively, whose employment was\r\nguaranteed to them for six months at least.\r\n\r\nAs if the Admiralty, the horsedealers, the West Indies, Scotland,\r\nIreland, and unseasonable zeal were not enough, there must come upon the\r\nscene of the Board's deliberations that irrepressible being, the \"old\r\nsoldier.\" The first Board of William and Mary was generous in its\r\ndealings with its officials almost to a fault. This is a failing which\r\nsoon reaches ears, however distant. Several miners absent in Scotland,\r\nhoping that in the confusion the vouchers had been mislaid, complained\r\nthat they were in arrears of their pay, \"whereby,\" said the scoundrels,\r\n\"they were discouraged from performing their duties on this expedition.\"\r\nEnquiries were made by the Board, and in the emphatic language of their\r\nminute, it was found \"that they _lied_, having been fully paid up.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the time came for the Duke to shake off the immediate worries of\r\nthe office, as he proceeded to Chester and to Ireland, his relief must\r\nhave been great. With him he took the chief waggon-master to assist in\r\nthe organization of the train in Ireland, leaving his deputy at the\r\nTower to perform his duties. The suite of the Master-General on his ride\r\nto Chester included six sumpter mules with six sumpter men, clad in\r\nlarge grey coats, the sleeves faced with _orange_, and \"the coats to be\r\npaid for out of their pay.\"\r\n\r\nOnly two more remarks remain to be made. The proportion of drivers to\r\nthe horses of William's train of Artillery in Ireland may be gathered\r\nfrom an order still preserved directing a fresh lot of horses and men to\r\nbe raised in the following proportions: one hundred and eighty horses;\r\nthirty-six carters, and thirty-six boys.\r\n\r\nNext, the dress of the train can be learned from the following warrant,\r\nordering:—\r\n\r\n  \"That the gunners, matrosses, and tradesmen have coates of blew,\r\n  with Brass Buttons, and lyned with orange bass, and hats with orange\r\n  silk Galoome. The carters, grey coates lyned with the same.

By a Royal Warrant\r\ndated 22nd August, 1682, this company was reduced to sixty in number by\r\nweeding out the most incapable; the pay, which had up to this time\r\naveraged sixpence a day to each man, was increased to twelve-pence; but\r\nin return for this augmentation, strict military discipline was to be\r\nenforced; in addition to their ordinary duties at the Tower, they were\r\nto be constantly exercised once a week in winter, and twice a week in\r\nsummer by the Master-Gunner of England; they were to be dismissed if at\r\nany time found unfit for their duties; and a blow was struck at the\r\ncustom of men holding these appointments, and also working at their\r\ntrades near the Tower, by its being distinctly laid down that they were\r\nliable for duty not merely in that Fortress, but also \"in whatever other\r\nplace or places our Master-General of the Ordnance shall think fit.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the first landmark, proclaiming that a nucleus and a permanent\r\none of a trained and disciplined Artillery force was a necessity. Money\r\nwas not plentiful at the Ordnance Board under the Stuarts, as has\r\nalready been stated; so as time went on, and it was found necessary to\r\nincrease the educated element,—the fireworkers, petardiers, and\r\nbombardiers,—it was done first by reducing the number of gunners, and,\r\nat last, in 1686, by a grudgingly small increase to the establishment.\r\n\r\nIn 1697, after the Peace of Ryswick, there was in the English service a\r\nconsiderable number of comparatively trained artillerymen, whose\r\nservices during the war entitled them to a little consideration. This\r\nfact, coupled with the gradual growth in the minds of the military and\r\nOrdnance authorities of the sense of the dangers that lay in the\r\nspasmodic system, and the desirability of having some proportion of\r\nartillerymen always ready and trained for service and emergency, brought\r\nabout the first—albeit short-lived—permanent establishment, in a\r\nregimental form, of artillery in England. The cost of the new regiment\r\namounted to 4482_l._ 10_s._ per annum, in addition to the pay which some\r\nof them drew as being part of the old Ordnance permanent establishment.\r\nBut before a year had passed, the regiment was broken up, and a very\r\nsmall provision made for the officers. Some of the engineers, gentlemen\r\nof the Ordnance, bombardiers, and gunners were added to the Tower\r\nestablishment, and seventeen years passed before this premature birth\r\nwas succeeded by that of the Royal Regiment of Artillery.\r\n\r\nBut this landmark is a remarkable one; and in a history like the present\r\ndeserves special notice. Some of the officers afterwards joined the\r\nRoyal Artillery; most of them fought under Marlborough; and all had\r\nserved in William's continental campaign either by sea or land. Two of\r\nthe captains of companies, Jonas Watson and William Bousfield, had\r\nserved in the train in Flanders in 1694, and Albert Borgard, its\r\nadjutant, was afterwards the first Colonel of the Royal Artillery.\r\n\r\nThe staff of the little regiment consisted of a Colonel, Jacob Richards,\r\na Lieutenant-Colonel, George Browne, a Major, John Sigismund Schmidt, an\r\nAdjutant, Albert Borgard, and a Comptroller: of these the first four had\r\nbeen serving on active service in Flanders. There were four companies,\r\nvery weak, certainly, and containing men paid both on the old and new\r\nestablishments. Each contained 1 captain, 1 first-lieutenant, 1 second-\r\nlieutenant, 2 gentlemen of the Ordnance, 2 sergeants, and 30 gunners. Of\r\nthese the gentlemen of the Ordnance and 15 gunners per company were on\r\nthe old Tower establishment. The names of the captains not mentioned\r\nabove were Edward Gibbon, and Edmund Williamson.\r\n\r\nThere were also in the Regiment six engineers, four sub-engineers, two\r\nfiremasters, twelve fireworkers, and twelve bombardiers.\r\n\r\nWhen the regiment was reduced, the captains received 60_l._ per annum,\r\nthe first and second lieutenants 50_l._ and 40_l._ per annum, the\r\nfiremasters 60_l._, and the fireworkers 40_l._ These officers were\r\ndescribed as belonging to the new establishment, in contradistinction to\r\nthe old.\r\n\r\nThe time had now come when there was to be an establishment of Artillery\r\nin addition to these, whose school and arena were the campaigns of a\r\ngreat master of war, one who was to be the means, after a victorious\r\ncareer, of placing the stamp of permanence on what had as yet had but an\r\nephemeral existence,—the regimental character as applied to Artillery\r\nforces in England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n                         MARLBOROUGH'S TRAINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nALTHOUGH the description of campaigns which occurred before the\r\nregimental birth of the Royal Artillery is beyond the purpose and\r\nprovince of this history, yet so many of the officers and men who fought\r\nunder the great Duke of Marlborough, or served in the various trains\r\nequipped by his orders for Gibraltar, Minorca, and Nova Scotia,\r\nafterwards were embodied in the regiment, that the reader must greet\r\nwith pleasure any notice of the constitution of these Trains, as being\r\nin all probability typical of what the early companies of the Regiment\r\nwould be when attached to Ordnance for service in the field.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Marlborough was appointed Master-General of the Ordnance\r\nalmost immediately after the accession of Queen Anne, and until the day\r\nof his death he evinced the warmest and most intelligent interest in\r\neverything connected with the Artillery Service.\r\n\r\nThe reader will remember that one of the first acts of Queen Anne was to\r\ndeclare war against France, with her allies the Emperor of Germany and\r\nthe States-General. The declaration of war was not formally made until\r\nthe 4th May, 1702, but preparations had been going on for a couple of\r\nmonths before with a view to commencing hostilities. On the 14th March,\r\n1702, the warrant for the Train of Artillery required for the opening\r\ncampaign was issued to the Earl of Romney, then Master-General. The\r\nnumber of pieces of Ordnance required was fixed at 34, including 14\r\nsakers, 16 3-pounders, and 4 howitzers: and the _personnel_ considered\r\nadequate to the management of these guns consisted of two companies of\r\ngunners, one of pioneers, and one of pontoon men, in addition to the\r\nrequisite staff, and a number of artificers. Each company consisted of a\r\ncaptain, a lieutenant, a gentleman of the Ordnance, six non-commissioned\r\nofficers, twenty-five gunners, and an equal number of matrosses. At this\r\ntime the fireworkers and bombardiers were not on the strength of the\r\ncompanies as was afterwards the case. Two fireworkers and eight\r\nbombardiers accompanied this train.\r\n\r\nThe pioneers were twenty in number, with two sergeants, and there was\r\nthe same number of pontoon men, with two corporals, the whole being\r\nunder a Bridge-master. The staff of the train consisted of a colonel, a\r\nlieutenant-colonel, a major, a comptroller, a paymaster with his\r\nassistant, an adjutant, a quartermaster, a chaplain, a commissary of\r\nhorse, a surgeon and assistant-surgeon, and a provost-marshal. The\r\nkettledrummer and his coachman accompanied the train. There were also\r\npresent with this train a commissary of stores with an assistant, two\r\nclerks, twelve conductors, eight carpenters, four wheelwrights, three\r\nsmiths, and two tinmen.\r\n\r\nThe rates of pay of the various attendants are again worthy of note. The\r\nmaster carpenter, smith, and wheelwright got a shilling daily more than\r\nthe assistant-surgeon, who had to be happy on 3_s._ per diem; the\r\nprovost-marshal and the tinman each got 2_s._ 6_d._; the clerks and the\r\ngentlemen of the Ordnance were equally paid 4_s._; the chaplain,\r\nadjutant, and quartermaster received 6_s._ each; a lieutenant received\r\nthe same, and a fireworker 2_s._ less. The pay of the higher ranks was\r\nas follows:—Colonel, 1_l._ 5_s._; lieutenant-colonel and comptroller,\r\neach 1_l._; major, 15_s._; and paymaster, 10_s._ The gunners received\r\n1_s._ 6_d._; matrosses, pioneers, and pontoon-men, each, 1_s._.\r\n\r\nIt was the month of June, 1702, before this train landed in Holland, and\r\non the 30th of that month it joined the Allied Army at Grevenbrouck,\r\nhaving had an addition made to it of four guns before leaving England.\r\nThe pay of the train amounted to 9289_l._ 5_s._ per annum; and the\r\nammunition with which they commenced the campaign consisted of 3600\r\nrounds, of which 3000 were round shot, and 600 canister or case. They\r\nalso carried 31 boxes of small hand-grenades, and 754 grenades of a\r\nlarger description. The conduct in the field of this train was\r\nadmirable. During the whole campaign of 1702, their fire is described as\r\nhaving been carried on with \"as much order, despatch, and success as\r\never before was seen.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then, in the luxurious way in which war was made in those days, the\r\narmy went into winter quarters.\r\n\r\nFor the campaign of 1703, it was decided to augment the train of\r\nArtillery, and a warrant to that effect was issued to the Ordnance on\r\nthe 8th February, 1703. The only difference in the _personnel_ of the\r\ntrain was the addition of five gunners to each company, they now\r\noutnumbering the matrosses for the first time. The addition to the guns\r\nconsisted of six demi-culverins.\r\n\r\nIn March of this year, the Board of Ordnance was also called upon to fit\r\nout two bomb-vessels for service in the Channel; and as the bomb-service\r\nremained long after the Regiment existed, it may be interesting to the\r\nreader to learn the armament of these vessels. It consisted of three 13-\r\ninch brass sea-service mortars, one vessel carrying two. For ammunition\r\nthey carried 1200 shells and 40 carcasses,—besides 248 barrels of\r\npowder. The Artillerymen on board were represented by three fireworkers,\r\nsix bombardiers, and two artificers; but as provision was made for ten,\r\nnot eleven, \"small flock bedds, bolsters, ruggs, and blankets,\" it is to\r\nbe presumed either that one of the number was above the necessity of\r\nsleep, or that a certain socialism existed in the matter of beds, which\r\nadmitted of the individual on duty adjourning to the bed vacated by the\r\nman who relieved him.\r\n\r\nIn a later warrant of the same year, when a larger number of these\r\nvessels was ordered to the Mediterranean, a Firemaster at 8_s._ per diem\r\nwas placed over the fireworkers, and a few conductors of stores were\r\nadded.\r\n\r\nA further addition was made in 1704 to the train in Holland, showing the\r\nincreased appreciation of the services of the Artillery. It consisted of\r\nsix brass culverins and four 3-pounders, with two gentlemen of the\r\nOrdnance, sixteen gunners, and sixty of their assistants, the matrosses.\r\nTwo more artificers were also added.\r\n\r\nAn idea of the Artillery train under Marlborough's own command can be\r\nobtained from the above dry details, and when compared with the\r\nproportions of Artillery in the armies of more recent times,\r\nMarlborough's train excites a smile. The value of Artillery in the field\r\nhad not yet been learned, while the cumbrous nature of its equipment was\r\npainfully present to every General. Not until Napoleon came on the scene\r\ndid Artillery assume its proper place in European armies; not until the\r\nFranco-German War of 1870 did it assume its proper place in European\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nBut equally interesting with the details of the train which Marlborough\r\ncommanded are those of the trains, which, as Master-General of the\r\nOrdnance, he prepared for expeditions and services under other\r\ncommanders, in the stormy time which was hushed to rest by the Peace of\r\nUtrecht.\r\n\r\nWhen the expedition to Portugal, ordered in 1703, but which did not take\r\nplace till the following year, was decided on, the armament selected\r\nconsisted merely of five brass sakers, and one 5¼-pounder.\r\n\r\nFor this small battery, a somewhat eccentric detail of attendants was\r\nordered, characterized by the marked absence of Artillery _officers_.\r\nThey were as follows:—One commander, styled commander-in-chief, with a\r\ndaily pay of 1_l._; six engineers, with 10_s._ each; a commissary of\r\nstores, five bombardiers, twenty gunners, and ten miners. The absence of\r\nmatrosses in this detail is also remarkable. The deficiencies in this\r\ntrain soon became apparent, for in 1705 we find it was reinforced by a\r\ncaptain, a lieutenant, a fireworker, a surgeon, and forty-two matrosses,\r\nwith a proportion of non-commissioned officers. And with the\r\nreinforcement came six mountain 3-pounders—guns, which from this time\r\nand for many years were familiarly known as grasshoppers.\r\n\r\nAmong the other musty warrants of this time, calling upon \"our entirely-\r\nbeloved Master-General of the Ordnance, John Duke of Marlborough,\" to\r\nfurnish various trains and necessaries, one short one on the 3rd\r\nOctober, 1704, has a peculiar interest. Intelligence had just been\r\nreceived of the capture of Gibraltar by Sir George Rooke, and it became\r\nnecessary to send, for the better protection of the Rock, a few guns,\r\nand some men familiar with their use. In this year, 1872, seven\r\nBatteries of Artillery, each numbering 160 men when complete, are\r\nconsidered necessary, the lesson not having yet been forgotten, which\r\nwas taught by the great siege, when five weak companies were all the\r\nArtillery in the garrison, and gunners had to be improvised out of the\r\nranks of the Infantry. But the force during the great siege was lavish\r\ncompared with that deemed sufficient at first \"for the better defence of\r\ny^e said place.\" One chief engineer, Talbot Edwards by name, a\r\nstorekeeper and his clerk, two fireworkers, six bombardiers, and fifty-\r\nfive gunners, were at first deemed sufficient Artillery force for the\r\ndefence of a place whose chief means of protection lay in its guns.\r\nHalf-a-dozen brass 13-inch mortars, and four-and-twenty guns on ship\r\ncarriages, varying from 6-pounders to 24-pounders, constituted the\r\narmament sent from England.\r\n\r\nIn April of the following year the Master-General was called upon to\r\nfurnish a train for that romantic expedition to Spain under the\r\nbrilliant Earl of Peterborough, the services of which afterwards at the\r\ncapture of Barcelona called forth such commendation. It was a very small\r\none. In a corps of 5000 men the following was the proportion of\r\nArtillery:—One colonel, one adjutant, two engineers, a commissary, a\r\npaymaster, four conductors, one master-gunner, four sergeants, four\r\ncorporals, ten gunners, one firemaster, one fireworker, two bombardiers,\r\ntwo carpenters, three wheelwrights, two smiths, and a collar-maker.\r\nMortars on travelling carriages were used by this train, and a\r\nconsiderable number of sets of men-harness which accompanied it suggests\r\nthe idea that the services of the other troops, or the peasantry, were\r\nenlisted, when necessary, to move the train from place to place.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1706, 11,000 men under the command of Earl Rivers were ordered\r\nto sail from Plymouth on a wild and futile scheme for the invasion of\r\nFrance. The following was the proportion of Artillery considered\r\nnecessary for this force by the Board over which Marlborough presided.\r\nThe guns were forty-six in number, including twenty 24-pounders, six\r\nculverins, four 12-pounders, four demi-culverins, and six sakers. There\r\nwere also sixty small coehorn mortars.\r\n\r\nTo man the train, the following was the detail: a colonel, four\r\nengineers, two sub-engineers, a paymaster, a surgeon, with an assistant,\r\na captain, a lieutenant, two gentlemen of the Ordnance, three sergeants,\r\nthree corporals, thirty-two gunners, and sixty-four matrosses, a\r\nlieutenant of miners, and seventeen men, a firemaster, three\r\nfireworkers, and twelve bombardiers, a commissary, clerk of the stores,\r\ntwelve conductors, three smiths, three wheelwrights, five carpenters,\r\ntwo coopers, a collar-maker, two farriers, and fifteen carters. In this\r\ntrain the lieutenant of miners and the chief carpenter, received each\r\n4_s._ a day, while the assistant-surgeon with his 3_s._ remains ranked\r\nwith the farriers, cooper's mate, and collar-maker.\r\n\r\nThe list of stores is too long for reproduction here. But it included\r\n200 sets of single harness for men, and four sets of harness for fifty\r\nmen to each set. Tumbrils and waggons innumerable were ordered; 400\r\nwheelbarrows, 2000 palisadoes, 1600 horseshoes, tents, single and double\r\nbeds, and an assortment of artificers' tools such as would enrich a\r\ncolony. Altogether it was an appalling catalogue. The ammunition for the\r\ntrain included 22,000 round shot, 2400 mortar-bombs, 800 case-shot, and\r\n3000 barrels of powder. For the Infantry 46 tons of musket-shot were\r\ncarried, and 100,000 flints.\r\n\r\nIn 1707, it was resolved to reduce the trains formerly under the\r\ndirections of Lords Galway, Peterborough, and Rivers, into one field\r\ntrain for service in Spain, and as the Board of Ordnance reported that\r\nthey had no money for the subsistence of the train, the commissioners of\r\nthe Treasury were ordered to pay the cost out of the 500,000_l._ voted\r\nby Parliament with a view to \"strengthening the Army of the Duke of\r\nSavoy for making good our alliances with the King of Portugal, and for\r\nthe more effectual carrying on the war of the recovery of the Spanish\r\nmonarchy to the house of Austria.\" _Tempora mutantur_: what ministerial\r\neloquence would be able to charm money out of a House of Commons now for\r\nsuch a purpose? The following was the detail of the combined train:—one\r\ncolonel, and one lieutenant-colonel, receiving the same pay, 1_l._ 5_s._\r\nper diem; one major, at 15_s._; one comptroller, at 1_l._; one\r\npaymaster, at 8_s._ and an assistant at 3_s._ 6_d._; an adjutant,\r\nquartermaster, commissary of horse, and waggon-master, each at 6_s._; a\r\nsurgeon, at 5_s._, and two assistants, at 3_s._; two captains, two\r\nlieutenants, two gentlemen of the Ordnance, six sergeants, six\r\ncorporals, forty gunners, eighty matrosses, four drummers, ten\r\nengineers, a fireworker, two bombardiers, twelve conductors, and twenty-\r\none artificers. There was also a provost-marshal with two assistants.\r\n\r\nOnly one more train requires to be mentioned. After the legislative\r\nunion between Scotland and England, it was decided by the Board of\r\nOrdnance to establish a small permanent train, called the train for\r\nNorth Britain, at Edinburgh, Stirling, and Fort William. As mentioned in\r\nthe first chapter of this book, the last-named place did not derive the\r\nbenefit that was contemplated at the formation of this train. From the\r\nnature of the Ordnance sent to Scotland, the absence of conductors and\r\nmatrosses, and the presence of storekeepers and gunsmiths, it is evident\r\nthat a field train, in the sense of one for service in the field, was\r\nnot contemplated. The defence of the fortresses at the three places\r\nnamed was all that was intended, combined with the supervision of the\r\nOrdnance Stores which might be deposited in them.\r\n\r\nThe capture of Minorca during the war involved a small train for Port\r\nMahon in that Island; and another was required for Annapolis in 1710.\r\n\r\nAfter the Peace of Utrecht, the Ordnance Board found that in addition to\r\nits small peace establishment in England there were four trains to keep\r\nup permanently, whether in peace or war, which were not required before.\r\nThese were the trains of North Britain, Gibraltar, Port Mahon, and a\r\njoint train for service in Placentia and Annapolis.\r\n\r\nThe _raison d'être_ of the trains at the first three of these places has\r\nalready been given. To explain the circumstances under which the other\r\nplaces became a charge on the Ordnance will require another chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n                               ANNAPOLIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nON the Nova Scotian side of the Bay of Fundy, immediately opposite the\r\nCity of St. John, New Brunswick, there is a narrow inlet of the sea,\r\nwalled by perpendicular and densely wooded hills. A few scattered\r\ncottages, belonging to fishermen, speck the deep green of the forest, as\r\nthe traveller passes up this narrow channel, known by the uneuphonious\r\nname of Digby Gut. Digby is a small picturesque village, immediately\r\ninside the channel, which here opens out into a wide basin, large enough\r\nto float mighty navies, and beyond description beautiful. In the spring\r\nof 1604, a French Protestant, M. de Monts, first discovered this harbour\r\nof safety, and one of his comrades, Potrincourt by name, was so\r\nenchanted by its beauties, that he applied to the French monarch for a\r\ngrant of the surrounding district. At the end of the basin, furthest\r\nfrom the entrance and at the mouth of a river, now called the Cornwallis\r\nriver, he built a Fort and a village, to which he gave the name of Port\r\nRoyal. The history of this little village has been one of marvellous\r\ninterest; and until the beginning of the eighteenth century, it was\r\nwritten in letters of blood. Since it finally became the property of\r\nEngland, its existence has been a peaceful one; and now, alas, the\r\nmouldering ramparts, the tumbling, grass-grown walls of the old fort,\r\nand the windowless, stairless barrack, proclaim in unmistakable language\r\nthe advent of a new colonial epoch, and the retreat of British troops\r\nbefore that new enemy—expense. The train required for its defence, after\r\nits final capture, was one of the arguments used in favour of creating a\r\npermanent force of Artillery in England; and for more than a century\r\nthis village of Port Royal, or Annapolis, has been entwined in the\r\nhistory of the Royal Artillery.\r\n\r\nIf all historical researches were pursued in such beautiful localities,\r\nthe historian would be the veriest sybarite of literature. By the\r\ntumbling fortifications now stands one of the loveliest villages on the\r\nface of this world. The river, at whose mouth it is built, wanders\r\nthrough a valley, which, in summer, is like a dream of beauty. Rich\r\n_intervalle_ land on either bank, covered with heavy crops of every\r\nkind; fields and gardens studded with apple-trees, planted by the old\r\nFrench inhabitants; grapes in heavy clusters growing and ripening in the\r\nopen air, and clean, white churches and cottages studding the landscape\r\nfor miles; all unite in forming a picture, like the Utopia which haunts\r\nthe dreamer's mind. The garden of Canada—an Artilleryman may well\r\nrejoice that so lovely a spot had a share in the birth of the corps to\r\nwhich he belongs.\r\n\r\nThe early history of the place may be summed up in a few words. In 1606,\r\nan addition to the little colony was made of more French emigrants;\r\ncultivation of the soil, and the breeding of cattle occupied the\r\npeaceful inhabitants; and they lived in perfect amity with the\r\nsurrounding Indians. Difficulties having arisen about the original\r\ncharter, Potrincourt went to France, and secured from the King the grant\r\nof the territory: subject, however, to a distasteful condition, that he\r\nshould take two Jesuit priests with him on his return. He did so; but\r\nmade them as uncomfortable as he could, and in 1613, they left him to\r\njoin a settlement, also near the Bay of Fundy, vowing vengeance against\r\nhim in their hearts. Although England and France were at peace, a sea\r\nrover from Virginia, named Argoll, came with his ship, and pillaged the\r\nJesuits' new home, killing one, and making the other prisoner. Fired by\r\nhis success, and urged and guided by the revengeful priest, he next\r\nfitted out an expedition against Port Royal, and succeeded in destroying\r\nthe fort, and scattering the settlers, some of whom joined the\r\nneighbouring Indian tribes. During the next few years, more French\r\nimmigrants settled in a scattered, unmethodical way, over the province\r\nof Nova Scotia, or Acadia, as it was called; and some coming to Port\r\nRoyal, the little colony commenced to revive.\r\n\r\nBut in 1627, Kirke's fleet sailed from England to destroy the French\r\nsettlements in Nova Scotia; and among others, he ravaged unhappy Port\r\nRoyal. And from this time dates the struggle in America between France\r\nand England, which lasted a hundred years. In 1629, it may be said, that\r\nwe had added Nova Scotia to our possessions; but in 1632, we gave it\r\nback to France; Charles I. having been in treaty with the French King,\r\neven while our expedition in America was at work, and having consented\r\nto let the French have Quebec and all our recent American conquests back\r\nagain. In 1655, Cromwell recovered Port Royal, by means of an expedition\r\nhe sent for that purpose, under one Major Sedgwick. The fort had by this\r\ntime been strengthened and armed; but it had to surrender to the\r\nimpetuosity of our troops. Much labour and money was now spent on the\r\nfortifications by the English, but all to no purpose, for by the treaty\r\nof Breda, Charles II. ceded Nova Scotia to the French again. Certainly,\r\nthe Stuarts were cruel to our colonies; and it required all the\r\nenterprise of our merchants, and all the courage and skill of our seamen\r\nand fishermen to resist utter extinction under the treatment they\r\nreceived. The day was to come—and to last for many a year, when a worse\r\nevil than the Stuarts was to blight our colonies—the nightmare of the\r\nColonial Office. As the former was the positive, so it was the\r\ncomparative degree of colonial endurance. Is it true that a superlative\r\ndegree is coming on them now? Is it true, that in our Statesmen's minds\r\nthere exists a coldness, an indifference to our colonies, which in time\r\nof trial or danger will certainly pass into impatience, and anxiety to\r\nbe free from colonial appendages?\r\n\r\nIf it be so, then, indeed, the superlative degree of blundering and\r\nmisery is approaching; but the misery, like the blundering, will be\r\nfound this time, not in the colonies, but in England.\r\n\r\nFor sixteen years after the treaty of Breda, Port Royal was left\r\ncomparatively undisturbed; the French population reaching, in the year\r\n1671, 361 souls; 364 acres having been brought under cultivation, and\r\nnearly 1000 sheep and cattle being owned by the settlers.\r\n\r\nIn 1680, however, the English again, for the fifth time, obtained\r\npossession of it; and again lost it. After its recapture, and before\r\n1686, considerable additions had been made to the fortifications by the\r\nFrench; and in the treaty of that year between France and England, it\r\nwas resolved—a resolution which was never kept—that although the mother\r\ncountries might quarrel, their respective American subjects might\r\ncontinue to maintain mutual peaceable relations. After the Revolution of\r\n1688, war broke out in Europe once more between France and England, and\r\ntheir American children followed suit. Port Royal being the head-\r\nquarters for the French ships attracted the attention of Sir William\r\nPhipps, who after capturing and pillaging it abandoned it again to the\r\nFrench.\r\n\r\nAnd the treaty of Ryswick again officially announced that the whole of\r\nNova Scotia was French territory.\r\n\r\nIn 1699, and again in 1701, considerable labour was devoted by the\r\nFrench to strengthening the works of Port Royal; an increase to the\r\ngarrison was made from France, and the militia in the surrounding\r\nsettlements were carefully trained and armed.\r\n\r\nEvery difficulty was interposed by the French governors between the\r\nsettlers and the New England merchants, who were mutually eager for\r\ntrade. Exasperated by prohibitory duties on their wares, the latter\r\nfirst tried smuggling, and then hostile expeditions. One such was made\r\nfrom Boston in 1704; and although Port Royal made a successful\r\nresistance, much damage was done to the surrounding country.\r\n\r\nIn 1707, two expeditions were made from New England, and a large force\r\nof militia accompanied them. They were convoyed by a man-of-war, and\r\nwould undoubtedly have captured the place, had it not been for the\r\npersonal energy of Subercase, the French governor, who rallied the\r\nneighbouring inhabitants, and drove back the English, thoroughly\r\ndispirited. On the second occasion, the English attempted to float their\r\nartillery up the river with the tide by night, and attack the fort from\r\nthe land side. The rise and fall of the tide in the Bay of Fundy and its\r\ninlets are very great, often reaching sixty feet. The French governor,\r\nseeing the enemy's design, lit large fires along the banks of the river,\r\nand exposed the drifting boats with the English guns on board to the\r\nview of the artillerymen in the fort, who opened a fire which utterly\r\nprevented the English from advancing further, or effecting a landing. By\r\nthe 1st of September, the New Englanders were utterly foiled and\r\ndispirited, the object of the expedition was frustrated, and the fleet\r\nweighed anchor and returned to Boston. After these two attempts,\r\nrendered unsuccessful by the marvellous tact and energy of one man, Port\r\nRoyal enjoyed comparative rest, and the leisure of the inhabitants was\r\ndevoted to strengthening the works during the next two years.\r\n\r\nBefore describing the circumstances of its final capture, let some\r\nexplanation be given of the incessant war which went on for so many\r\nyears between the French and English colonists in North America. It was\r\nnot a burning interest in the European questions agitating the parent\r\ncountries that animated their Western children; the parent quarrels were\r\nan excuse, but not a reason, for their mutual aggression; and the\r\nabsence of such excuse did not ensure peace in America. The cause lay in\r\nthe two feelings which prompt most wars: thirst for revenge and love of\r\ntrade. The way in which the last acted has already been hinted at. There\r\nwas undoubtedly a market among the French colonists, which was all the\r\nNew England merchants could desire; and so ready were the French\r\npeasants to trade, that no prohibitory action of their rulers could\r\nconceal their desire, although in a great measure it might prevent its\r\ngratification. The knowledge of this made the New Englanders frantic.\r\nThey were men of immense energy, as they are now; they were of\r\nmagnificent physique, made for war and hardship; and they rebelled\r\nagainst any obstacle to what they deemed their legitimate wishes. Their\r\nanger became intolerance; their intolerance became aggressive; and the\r\nresult was first smuggling, then privateering, and finally war.\r\n\r\nBut another motive was thirst for revenge. And why? Was there not room\r\non this vast continent for both nations to plant any wandering or\r\nsurplus children, without the vile passions seeking place, which thrive\r\nin the hot-bed of crowded, neighbouring, and rival states? Here the old\r\npoet's words come in most truly: \"Cœlum, non animum, mutant, qui trans\r\nmare currunt.\"\r\n\r\nNational jealousies _were_ reproduced: the French allied themselves in\r\nCanada with the Indians, and incessant incursions were made thence by\r\nthem on the English colonies. Hardly a child grew up in New England who\r\ndid not know of some hideous tragedy in the domestic life of his\r\nimmediate neighbours, if not in his own family; from infancy one of the\r\narticles of his creed was detestation of the French; and this feeling\r\nfound ready and revengeful expression whenever opportunity offered. But\r\nrevenge is not always true in its aim, is indeed often wofully blind;\r\nand too often when maddened with thoughts of cruelty and outrage on his\r\nwife or sisters—and what thoughts stir the Anglo-Saxon more fiercely?—he\r\nwould avenge himself wildly and recklessly on victims who mayhap were\r\ninnocent. And so the ghastly vendetta crossed from hand to hand, from\r\none side to the other, and hardly a year passed without its existence\r\nbeing attested by tales of horror and of blood!\r\n\r\nBut the end for Port Royal was approaching, an end which was to mean\r\ndefeat, but was to ensure a lasting peace. In 1709, news reached the\r\nGovernor of an intended attack on a large scale in the ensuing spring by\r\nthe English; and as his garrison had recently been much reduced by\r\ndisease, he wrote, strongly urging its reinforcement either from France,\r\nor from the French post at Placentia, in Newfoundland. Apparently, his\r\nrequest was not complied with; and after a gallant, and almost heroic\r\nresistance, Port Royal capitulated in the following year to the\r\nexpeditionary forces under the command of Colonel Nicholson, comprising\r\nregular troops from England, militia from New York, and a strong train\r\nof Artillery,—the whole being supported by a powerful fleet. On the 2nd\r\nOctober, 1710, the capitulation was signed; and, out of compliment to\r\nthe Queen, the name of the village was changed to Annapolis.\r\n\r\nA fortnight after the expedition left England for New York and Boston,\r\n_en route_ to Port Royal, a Royal Warrant was issued establishing a\r\nTrain of Artillery to _garrison Annapolis_. It will thus be seen that so\r\nconfident was the English Government of the success of the expedition,\r\nthat the new name for Port Royal had already been fixed, and\r\narrangements made for a permanent garrison. The acquisition of\r\nNewfoundland followed; the French garrison of Placentia were allowed\r\nwith many of the inhabitants to go to the Island of Cape Breton, where\r\nthey fortified a place which will occupy a prominent part in this\r\nvolume, Louisbourg; and the year 1713 saw, by the Treaty of Utrecht,\r\nAcadia or Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland formally surrendered to the\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\nThe train of Artillery formed to garrison Annapolis, and its adjunct\r\nordered three years later for Placentia, were two of the permanent\r\ntrains used as arguments in 1716 for establishing a fixed Artillery\r\nRegiment which could feed these foreign garrisons—arguments which in\r\nthat year brought into existence the Royal Regiment of Artillery.\r\n\r\nThe Artillery garrison ordered for Annapolis in 1710, comprised a\r\ncaptain, a lieutenant, a surgeon, 4 non-commissioned officers, 11\r\ngunners, 40 matrosses, an engineer, a storekeeper, 3 bombardiers, and 2\r\narmourers.\r\n\r\nThat for Placentia was smaller and differently constituted. It consisted\r\nof an engineer, a master-gunner, 20 gunners, a mason, a smith, a\r\ncarpenter, and an armourer.\r\n\r\nThe cost of the Annapolis train was 1964_l._ 18_s._ 4_d._ per annum:\r\nthat of the Placentia train was 1259_l._ 5_s._ After the Regiment was\r\ncreated, these two trains or garrisons were generally furnished by the\r\nsame company, and mutually met each other's deficiencies or demands. For\r\nmany years, these places appeared in the Ordnance estimates, not merely\r\nas items in the expense of maintaining the Artillery and Engineers, but\r\nalso as requiring considerable sums for fortifications. Occasionally the\r\nnumber of men was reduced, as in 1725, when at Placentia there were only\r\n1 lieutenant and 8 gunners; and at Annapolis, 1 lieutenant, 2\r\nbombardiers, 4 gunners, and 7 matrosses. But the amount spent on the\r\nfortifications remained for years very considerable. Up to the year\r\n1759, the average spent on this item annually at the two places was\r\n3000_l._ and 1000_l._; but in 1747 and 1748, evidently exceptional\r\nyears, the expenditure rose to 10,000_l._ and 6000_l._ respectively. In\r\n1759, a large sum appears to have been spent in transporting to Nova\r\nScotia the guns and stores taken from the French at Louisbourg. After\r\n1759, Annapolis gradually dwindles down as a military station, being\r\ndwarfed by Halifax, whose Artillery expenses in that year alone amounted\r\nto nearly 40,000_l._\r\n\r\nFor a century longer, Annapolis retained the special distinction of\r\ngiving the title of Governor, with a considerable income, to the officer\r\ncommanding the troops in the maritime provinces of British North\r\nAmerica. But its martial glory has now altogether faded; gradually\r\ndiminishing in numbers, its garrison at length consisted of the solitary\r\nbarrack sergeant, who is the \"last man\" of every military epic; and now\r\neven he has departed. The old Fort is a ruin, the barracks crumbling and\r\nunsightly; but, in spite of the pain one feels at first witnessing this\r\nmodern indifference to ancient story,—this forgetfulness of the memories\r\nwhich in stately procession troop through the student's mind,—this\r\nfeeling is soon obliterated as one turns to gaze on happy homesteads and\r\nblooming gardens, and on contented faces which meet one at every turn as\r\none wanders over the fertile country, away even to that \"Bloody Creek,\"\r\nwhere, in one of their many engagements, some thirty Englishmen met a\r\ncruel death, by an unexpected attack made by some Indians.\r\n\r\nWhere are the Indians now? A few drunken, demoralized creatures hang\r\nabout some of the towns; two or three only have retained their love and\r\ninstinct for the chase; and before many years shall have passed away,\r\nAcadia shall know the Mic-mac no more!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n                       THE BIRTH OF THE REGIMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE hour had come,—and the man! The Duke of Marlborough was again at the\r\nhead of the Ordnance, and was both capable himself of detecting the\r\nfaults of the existing system, and of critically comprehending any\r\nsuggestions for its improvement which the Board might lay before him.\r\n\r\nNever had the old system so completely broken down as during the\r\nrebellion in Scotland in 1715. The best practical Artilleryman in the\r\npay of the Ordnance had been sent in command of the train—Albert\r\nBorgard; but two years' rust since the peace of Utrecht had so tarnished\r\nany brightness which Artillery details in England had gained in the\r\nfriction of the preceding campaigns, that Borgard's task was a hopeless\r\none. Suspicions have been cast upon the loyalty of the Duke of Argyle,\r\nwho commanded the King's forces in Scotland, and certainly, at first\r\nsight, his contradictory orders to the Artillery excite astonishment.\r\nBut it is more probable that the key to his management of this arm lay\r\nin the impossible task of creating order out of what Borgard himself\r\ndescribed as \"such confusion as cannot be expressed.\" In the month of\r\nDecember, the train was ordered to Scotland; it was February before they\r\nanchored in the Firth of Forth. The first orders received by Borgard\r\nfrom Argyle, were to send his ships and guns away to Innerkithen, and\r\nmarch his officers and \"artillery people\" to Stirling. On arriving\r\nthere, he was ordered to take command of a very confused train of field-\r\npieces, which had been ordered up from the Castle of Edinburgh. Part of\r\nthis train he succeeded in getting as far as Dundee, where orders were\r\nsent him to take the whole back again to Edinburgh _by water_. In the\r\nfollowing March, his enforced idleness was brought to an end by orders\r\nhe received to send back his vessels with the guns, which had never been\r\nunshipped, to London. He and his men were then to be available for other\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nSuch a gross case of inability to furnish, within any reasonable time,\r\nArtillery for service in the field, followed by such uselessness and\r\nconfusion, could not be overlooked, nor allowed to pass without an\r\neffort at improvement for the future. Public admission of defects in a\r\nDepartment cannot be expected; and when consciousness of their existence\r\nis present in the minds of the officials, their manner is to suggest a\r\nremedy, but to evolve the evil, which the remedy is to cure, either from\r\nother sources, or from their own imaginations. The student, who turns\r\nfrom the ghastly tale of incompetence and blundering in 1715, to see\r\nwhat steps the Ordnance Board took to prevent its recurrence, need not,\r\ntherefore, be surprised to find a very slight allusion to their own\r\nblunders, and a gushing catalogue of the benefits which will result from\r\nthe adoption of their new suggestions. In fact, in their letter of 10th\r\nJanuary, 1716, to the Master-General, the members of the Board use\r\nlanguage of virtuous and indignant protest; and instead of alluding to\r\nthe recent failures, they talk of the hardships which the existing\r\nsystem had wrought upon their office. It is, perhaps, ungracious to\r\ncriticise too closely the language used when suggesting a really\r\nimportant and valuable innovation; but when we find the foreign\r\nestablishments of Annapolis and Placentia, of Gibraltar and Port Mahon,\r\nquoted as the arguments in chief for a change, which would probably\r\nnever have been suggested but for the conspicuous failure of the\r\npreceding year, the temptation is irresistible to draw the mask from the\r\nface of complacent officialism.\r\n\r\nSumming the case up in a few words, it may be said that the annual cost\r\nof that part of the military branch of the office of the Ordnance which\r\nthe Board proposed gradually to abolish at this time, including the\r\nforeign establishments at the places above mentioned, amounted to\r\n16,829_l._ The Regimental establishment, which it was now proposed to\r\nsubstitute by degrees, consisting of four companies with an adequate\r\nstaff, would, on the Board's calculation, cost only 15,539_l._\r\n\r\nThe main reduction was to be obtained by allowing the North Britain\r\nestablishment, which cost annually 1200_l._, gradually to become\r\nextinct, the duties to be performed by the new companies. The foreign\r\nestablishments were also to be supplied in the same way. Of course, it\r\nwas not pretended that all this could be done at once. But as vacancies\r\noccurred in the existing establishment, the money would go to furnish\r\nmen for the cadres of the new companies, which it was proposed at once\r\nto create. And by removing the Artillery officers and the 120 gunners\r\nnow on the old establishment to the rolls of the new companies, the\r\nskeletons would have a little flesh and blood from the commencement.\r\n\r\nThe details of the other economies suggested by the Board, and the list\r\nof officials whose places it was not proposed to fill when vacant,\r\nnaturally excite the curiosity of the student. Surely, this time at\r\nleast, a little self-denial will be practised by the Honourable Board;\r\nsome superfluous clerks and secretaries will be lopped off; and after\r\ntheir protest against those members of the military branch who never go\r\non duty without having heavy travelling charges and extra pay, surely we\r\nshall find some economy practised by the Honourable Board, whose members\r\nrevel in these very items. Alas! no. Tradition is too strong; and self-\r\npreservation is their first instinct. There are storekeepers in\r\nEdinburgh and Fort William, whom distance will prevent from personal\r\nremonstrance; a percentage of their wretched income can safely be taken.\r\nAnd as for those whose offices are ultimately to be extinguished, they\r\nthemselves can have no personal grievance, and posterity can look after\r\nitself. So, engineers, and firemasters, and petardiers, are marked for\r\ndestruction; and the Board's sacrilegious hand is raised against the\r\nMaster-Gunner of England himself!\r\n\r\nIt was on the 26th day of May, 1716, that the Regimental Baby was born.\r\nIt was smaller than had been expected; but it has proved a healthy and\r\nlong-lived child, and, as its nurse might have said, it has grown out of\r\nall knowledge. Only two companies—without any staff—were given at first,\r\nat an annual cost of 4891_l._ But, in Colonel Miller's clear language,\r\n\"considering that these two companies were never reduced, and that the\r\nremaining two, as well as the field-officers, were added within a few\r\nyears, there can be no hesitation about taking this as the starting-\r\npoint for any _Regimental Records_ of the Royal Artillery.\"\r\n\r\nIn December, 1716, the Board was able to inform the Master-General of\r\nthe success of the scheme: the two companies were nearly complete; but\r\nthe dream of feeding the foreign establishments could not be realized,\r\nfrom the fact that only half its proposal had, as yet, been carried into\r\neffect. So it was obliged to request, that arrangements for these should\r\nbe made for the present, elsewhere than from the two companies at home.\r\nEre many years had passed, the whole of the scheme recommended by the\r\nDuke of Marlborough was at work; in 1722, a Colonel was given to the\r\nRegiment; and in 1727, we find a Lieutenant-Colonel and a Major, as well\r\nas four complete companies; but in the years of comparative quiet which\r\nfollowed, no further augmentation took place. It was not until the year\r\n1740, that we find two more companies were added to the Regiment.\r\n\r\nThe name of the Lieutenant-Colonel in 1727, one we have already met\r\nwith, and who had seen much service, was Jonas Watson. That of the Major\r\nwas James Petit. He also had seen considerable service; but neither of\r\nthem in that respect could approach the brave and experienced officer to\r\nwhom the command of the Regiment was given by George I., in 1722, and\r\nemphatically renewed by George II., in 1727, the celebrated Albert\r\nBorgard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n                            ALBERT BORGARD.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOT a statesman, not over-refined, and no scholar, a mere soldier of\r\nfortune—yet brave, and honest, and true—Albert Borgard deserves more\r\nthan a passing notice in a history of the Regiment which he was the\r\nfirst to command.\r\n\r\nHe was by birth a Dane. Born in 1659, he commenced his life as a soldier\r\nwhen sixteen years of age, and until the day of his death, on the 7th\r\nFebruary, 1751, at the age of ninety-two years, he never had a thought\r\nbeyond his profession and his duty. The diary appended to this chapter\r\ngives in his own words the best summary of his career which can be\r\nwritten. For _naïveté_ and modesty, it can hardly be surpassed. The\r\ncompression into two or three lines, of events on which most men would\r\nenlarge with effusion; and the simple narrative of wounds and hardships,\r\nas if such were the ordinary circumstances of war, and unworthy of\r\nspecial comment, cannot fail to strike the most superficial reader. The\r\nonly sentence that gives us pain is the plaintive allusion to one who\r\nsupplanted him with the Board of Ordnance, as Consulting Artilleryman\r\nand Engineer. He was so devoted to his profession, that anything which\r\nlooked like putting him on one side hurt him beyond expression. There is\r\na time in the lives of many active men, when they realize painfully that\r\nothers are growing up who can outstrip them in work, or who have modern\r\nideas and appliances which it is now too late for them to learn. The\r\npain of such a discovery is, perhaps, the most acute that a man can\r\nfeel.\r\n\r\nFrom that date, Borgard devoted himself to his men. Living in the Warren\r\nat Woolwich, constantly among them, he was incessant in urging them to\r\nmaster the details of their profession. Being devoted himself to all\r\nlaboratory work, his order-books are full of instructions to the cadets\r\nand young officers, to devote their leisure to practical lessons in that\r\ndepartment. And he encouraged any who might succeed in making any good\r\n\"Firework\" to bring it to him for inspection and approval. He was a\r\nstrict disciplinarian; and some of the punishments he awarded would\r\nastonish modern soldiers. But he was essentially honest, incapable of\r\nfalsehood or meanness, and if every man in this worthy world were, like\r\nhim, brave and honest and true, what a Paradise it would be!\r\n\r\nHe commenced his military career in the service of the King of Denmark.\r\nHe went from that, in 1689, to the King of Prussia's service; served in\r\nHungary in 1691; and was induced by William III. to join the English\r\nservice in the following year. At the termination of hostilities he and\r\none other foreigner, named Schlunt, whose name appears in the list of\r\nofficers of the short-lived regiment of 1698, were the only Artillerymen\r\nother than English, who were selected to proceed to England for\r\npermanent employment.\r\n\r\nIn 1702, he went as Major in the expedition to Cadiz, and carried on a\r\nsuccessful bombardment with the five bomb-vessels under his command. In\r\nthe following year he volunteered for service under Marlborough, but,\r\nafter a few months in Flanders, he was recalled to proceed to Spain with\r\nthe expedition under Sir George Rooke and the Duke de Schomberg, which\r\nescorted the Archduke Charles, who had just been proclaimed by his\r\nfather, King of Spain. Until the year 1710, he was engaged in all the\r\nhostilities which were now carried on in Spain, and of which his diary\r\ngives a summary. In 1705, at the siege of Valencia, which was taken by\r\nthe English under Lord Galway, (who had been appointed to the command in\r\nplace of Schomberg), he lost his left arm; and in 1710, he was wounded\r\nin the leg by a round shot, and taken prisoner.\r\n\r\nBut his first service with the Royal Artillery, after its existence as a\r\nregiment, was in 1719, when he went in command of the Artillery of Lord\r\nCobham's force against Spain, and successfully bombarded Vigo. The\r\ntroops, 4000 in number, embarked in a squadron of five men-of-war under\r\nAdmiral Mighells, and coasting from Corunna to Vigo, were landed two or\r\nthree miles from the town. The garrison of Vigo withdrew to the citadel,\r\nspiking the guns in the town; but so heavy and well-directed was the\r\nfire of the English, that they soon capitulated.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the Artillery arrangements, both in preparing and handling\r\nthe train, had been under Colonel Borgard's sole control. Judging from\r\nthe entry in his diary, he was far more pleased by the success of his\r\ninventions and improvements in the _matériel_ of his train, than by the\r\nsurrender of the enemy.\r\n\r\nAs this was the first train of Artillery to which the Royal Artillery\r\nCompanies were attached on active service, it has been considered\r\ndesirable to give some details as to its constitution.\r\n\r\nFirst, as to _personnel_:—It was commanded by Colonel Borgard, assisted\r\nby a major, a captain, three lieutenants, and four fireworkers. The\r\nmedical staff, a surgeon and his assistant, received a little more\r\nremuneration than in former trains; their daily pay—which to a modern\r\near has a very legal sound—being respectively 6_s._ 8_d._ and 3_s._\r\n4_d._ There were seven non-commissioned officers, twenty gunners, forty\r\nmatrosses, two drummers, and ten artificers. Engineers, conductors,\r\ndrivers, and clerks were also present; and on account of the particular\r\nnature of the service on which the expeditionary force was to be\r\nengaged, ten watermen and a coxswain were included among the attendants\r\nof the train.\r\n\r\nNext, as to _matériel_:—Borgard selected for his purpose four 24-\r\npounders, four 9-pounders, and six 1½-pounders, brass guns, all mounted\r\non travelling carriages, with a proportion of spare carriages for the\r\nfirst and last, spare limbers for the second, and spare wheels for all.\r\nHe also took a number of brass mortars, six ten-inch, and two eight-\r\ninch, besides thirty Coehorn and twelve Royal mortars. The ammunition\r\ncomprised 9800 round shot, 180 grape, 3800 mortar shells, 1000 hand-\r\ngrenades, and 100 carcasses for the ten-inch mortars. Two bomb-vessels,\r\neach carrying a thirteen-inch mortar, and with two fireworkers, four\r\nbombardiers, and an artificer on board, accompanied the expedition, and\r\nwere also under Colonel Borgard's command.\r\n\r\nThe citadel capitulated on the 10th October, 1719, and a large quantity\r\nof guns and stores fell into the hands of the English. The first\r\noccasion, therefore, on which the Royal Artillery as a Regiment was\r\nrepresented on active service was completely successful. The expedition\r\nreturned to England in November.\r\n\r\nOne more incident remains to be enlarged upon ere we leave the gallant\r\nofficer to tell the story of his own life. In 1716, when attending an\r\nexperiment at the Foundry in Windmill Hill, where some brass guns were\r\nbeing recast, he was wounded in four places by an explosion which took\r\nplace, and by which seventeen of the bystanders lost their lives. The\r\naccident had been foretold—so the story goes—by a young Swiss named\r\nSchalch, who was thereupon invited, after his prophecy was fulfilled, to\r\nassist the Board of Ordnance in selecting a suitable place near London\r\nwhere all the guns required for the service might be cast.\r\n\r\nYoung Schalch's hands were rather tied in the matter; for he was limited\r\nto a radius of twelve miles round London. Had this not been the case, it\r\nis hardly probable that he would have named as the Depôt for national\r\nArtillery Stores, and as the National Arsenal—both of which he must have\r\nforeseen the place of his selection would become—a place so exposed as\r\nWoolwich. As it was, however, being limited to so small an area, his\r\nselection was a natural one for other than the reasons which would first\r\noccur to him, as it already had a special connection with Artillery\r\nmanufactures, and with that Board under whose orders he was to work.\r\n\r\nFew countries, and fewer Boards, have ever had a more faithful servant\r\nthan he proved. As Superintendent of the Foundries, which were built at\r\nhis suggestion, he lived for sixty years, \"during which time not a\r\nsingle accident \"occurred.\"[8] The Royal Artillery may well be proud of\r\nsuch a man, who, although not in the Regiment, was so intimately\r\nconnected with it by the nature of his duties; and as all the management\r\nof the various departments in the Arsenal is in the hands of officers of\r\nthe Regiment now, there is no better model for them to study than this\r\nfather, so to speak, of Woolwich Arsenal. And the interest which must be\r\nfelt in him for his own skill and services is increased by the knowledge\r\nthat no less than six of his descendants have held commissions in the\r\nRoyal Artillery.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAppended to the chapter will now be found the diary of Borgard, to which\r\nallusion has so often been made, copied from a manuscript in the Royal\r\nArtillery Regimental Library. In addition to the short account of his\r\nservices, it contains lists of the various battles and sieges in which\r\nhe took part, and the dates of his various commissions.\r\n\r\n\"An Account of the Battels, Sieges, &c., wherein Lieutenant-General\r\nAlbert Borgard hath served, with what time and station, and in what\r\nPrince's service, as also the dates of his commissions during the time\r\nof his being in the English service, viz.—\r\n\r\n  \"In the KING OF DENMARK'S Service.\r\n\r\n  1675. \"Served as a cadet in the Queen's Regiment of Foot, and was at\r\n  the siege of Wismar (a town in the territories of Mecklenburg), then\r\n  belonging to the Sweeds, which was taken by the Danes in the said\r\n  year in the month of December.\"\r\n\r\n  1676. \"Was ordered from the Army with a Detachment of Foot on board\r\n  the Fleet. A battle was fought with the Sweeds near Oeland in the\r\n  Baltick, the 11th of June, wherein the Danes obtained a compleat\r\n  victory. With the aforesaid Detachment in the month of July we\r\n  landed in Schonen, and joyned the Danish Army at the Siege of the\r\n  Castle at Helsingborg, which place the Danes took from the Sweeds in\r\n  the said month by capitulation.\r\n\r\n  \"Marched from thence, and was at the Siege of the Town and Castle of\r\n  Landskroon. One night the Sweeds made a great sally out of the Town\r\n  with Horse and Foot; the Danes beat them back, and followed them\r\n  into the town and took it sword in hand. The Castle after some days'\r\n  bombardment was taken by capitulation.\r\n\r\n  \"In the month of August, we marched from Landskroon to\r\n  Christianstat, which town was taken from the Sweeds, sword in hand,\r\n  some days after it was invested, without opening trenches. The\r\n  Garrison did consist of near 3000 men, which were all cut to pieces.\r\n  Liberty for three hours' time was granted to the soldiers to plunder\r\n  the town, where there was found a great deal of riches and treasure.\r\n\r\n  \"In the latter end of August, I was one of the 4000 men of the Army\r\n  which marched from Christianstat to besiege the Town Halmstat. Upon\r\n  their march they were intercepted and totally defeated by the\r\n  Sweeds, of which number not above 700 men made their escape.\r\n\r\n  \"In the month of September, several young men that were well\r\n  recommended were taken out of the Foot Regiments to be made gunners\r\n  of y^e Artillery, of which I was one of the number, and served as\r\n  such in the great Battle of Lund (in the month of December) between\r\n  the Sweeds and the Danes, which continued from sun-rising to sun-\r\n  setting. This was counted a drawn battle, because both Army's\r\n  Artillery remained in the field that night.\r\n\r\n  1677. \"I likewise served as a gunner in the Battle fought between\r\n  the Sweeds and the Danes, near Sierkiobing or Ronneberg, two leagues\r\n  from Landskroon, in the month of July, where the Sweeds had a\r\n  compleat victory. In the latter end of the same month I was ordered\r\n  from Schonen with more gunners to the Siege of Mastraud, in Norway.\r\n  In the month of July, the Town with a little Fort was attacked and\r\n  taken sword in hand, and two other Castles near the same place were\r\n  taken by capitulation. In the latter end of August we marched with a\r\n  body of the Norwegian Army, and fell in the night-time on the Sweeds\r\n  at Odewald, beat them, and took from them twelve pieces of cannon,\r\n  and all their baggage.\r\n\r\n  1678. \"In the month of September, a great Detachment of the Danish\r\n  Army, where I was one of the number, was ordered in the expedition\r\n  to the Island of Lauterugen, in the Baltick. We landed on the said\r\n  Island, though we mett with great opposition from the Sweeds. We\r\n  beat them and obliged them to retire to Stralsund.\r\n\r\n  1679. \"I was made a Fireworker, and ordered on a survey of the\r\n  Island of Sealand, in Denmark.\r\n\r\n  1680. \"I with another Fireworker was ordered to Berlin in exchange\r\n  of two Brandenburgher Fireworkers, sent to Denmark to learn the\r\n  difference of each nation's work relating to all sorts of warlike\r\n  and pleasaunt Fireworks.\r\n\r\n  1681. \"I was ordered to go from Berlin to Strasburg to perfect\r\n  myself in all things relating to Fortification.\r\n\r\n  1682. \"I was ordered back again from Strasburg to Gluckstadt, in\r\n  Holstein, where I was made Ensign in the Queen's Regiment of Foot.\r\n\r\n  1683. \"I was made a Lieutenant in the same Regiment, and ordered\r\n  with the Duke of Wirtemberg, who went a voluntier to the relief of\r\n  Vienna, in Austria, where I was in the Battle fought by the Germans\r\n  and Poles against the Turks the 11th day of September. The Turks\r\n  were totally defeated with the loss of their Artillery and greatest\r\n  part of their baggage.\r\n\r\n  1684. \"I was ordered with several other engineers under Colonel\r\n  Scholten's command to fortifie a place called Farrell, in the County\r\n  of Oldenburg.\r\n\r\n  1685. \"I was ordered by the aforesaid Duke of Wirtemberg, who went a\r\n  voluntier to Hungary, and was both of us at the Siege of Niewhausel\r\n  and the Battle of Grau in the month of August. The Germans beat the\r\n  Turks, and took twenty-three pieces of cannon, with some of their\r\n  baggage, and some days after the battle, Niewhausel was taken sword\r\n  in hand.\r\n\r\n  1686. \"I went as a voluntier to Hungary, and was at the Siege of\r\n  Buda, and was recommended to Colonel Barner, Commander of the\r\n  Imperial Artillery, who employ'd me during the Siege, in the\r\n  Artillery service. The lower town was taken in June without\r\n  opposition. The upper town and castle were taken sword in hand in\r\n  the month of September. Here I got so much plunder that paid for all\r\n  my campaign done in Hungary as a voluntier.\r\n\r\n  1687. \"I was made a Lieutenant in the King of Denmark's Drabenten\r\n  Guards, and was employed as Engineer in the new Fortifications made\r\n  at Copenhagen.\r\n\r\n  1688. \"I quitted the Danish Service on account of some injustice\r\n  done me in my promotion, and went as voluntier to Poland. I was well\r\n  recommended to his Polish Majesty. I was in the action that happen'd\r\n  at Budjack, when the Poles beat the Tartars, and killed and took\r\n  prisoners to the number of 2400. Here I took for my share two\r\n  Tartars prisoners, which had near cost me my life, by reason I would\r\n  not deliver them over to a Polish officer.\r\n\r\n  \"In the KING OF PRUSSIA'S Service.\r\n\r\n  1689. \"In the month of January I was made a Lieutenant in the\r\n  Prussian Guards, and the same year went with my Colonel, Baron\r\n  Truckis, who made a campaign as voluntier on the Rhine. I was in the\r\n  month of March in action of Niews, a little town between Keyserwart\r\n  and Cologne, where the Brandenburghers totally beat the French and\r\n  took all their baggage. In the month of June I was at the Siege of\r\n  Keyserwart, which place the Brandenburghers, after some days'\r\n  bombardment, took from the French by capitulation. In the month of\r\n  July we marched with the Army from Keyserwart to invest the town of\r\n  Bonn, which place was without intermission eight nights and days\r\n  bombarded, and totally destroyed. After the bombardment it was kept\r\n  blockaded till the month of September. In this bombardment I\r\n  commanded two mortars ordered me by Colonel Wyller, commander of the\r\n  Prussian Artillery. In the month of August I went from Bonn to\r\n  Mentz, a town besieged by the Emperour's and Allies' Army. In the\r\n  taking of the Counterscarps or Glacies of this place, it cost us\r\n  near 4000 men, by which means the town was obliged to capitulate. In\r\n  the month of September the Duke of Lorrain went with 10,000 men from\r\n  Mentz, to reinforce the Allies' Army at Bonn. By his arrival there\r\n  the attack was regularly carried on, in which service I was employed\r\n  as Engineer, under the direction of Colonel Gore, who had the\r\n  direction of the trenches carried on by the Dutch forces. The\r\n  Counterscarps or Glacies, with a ravelin and a counterguard, were\r\n  taken sword in hand with the loss of 3000 men. The enemy was beat\r\n  into the town, which obliged them in two days' after to capitulate.\r\n\r\n  1691. \"In the month of March 8000 of the Prussian troops were\r\n  ordered to Hungary. The company to which I belonged was included in\r\n  this number. We joined the Emperour's Army in the month of June, and\r\n  we fought a Battle with the Turks at a place called Solankeman,\r\n  where we beat them totally, and took upwards of 100 pieces of\r\n  cannon, with a great part of their baggage, in the month of August.\r\n\r\n  1692. \"I quitted the Prussian service, and agreed with Count de\r\n  Dohna for a Company of Foot, in a Regiment of Foot he was to raise\r\n  for the service of the Emperour. After some weeks spent in raising\r\n  men for my company, the capitulation broke off, because the Emperour\r\n  would not agree to the terms stipulated with the said Count. In the\r\n  month of April I went from the city of Dantzick to Holland, and from\r\n  thence in company with some Danish voluntiers to y^e Siege of\r\n  Namur. After the siege I went from Namur to the English and Allies'\r\n  camp at Melle, and from thence I marched with the Army to the camp\r\n  at Genap, where in the month of July I entered as Firemaster into\r\n  the English Artillery, under the command of Colonel Gore.\r\n\r\n  \"In the ENGLISH Service.\r\n\r\n  1692. \"I marched with the English Artillery to the Battle of\r\n  Steenkirke, and after the battle was ordered with a Detachment of\r\n  Fireworkers to joyn at Ostend those Artillery people which came from\r\n  England under the command of Sir Martin Beckman. From Ostend we\r\n  marched to Tourney, from thence to Dixmud, and at last to quarter at\r\n  Ghent.\r\n\r\n  1693. \"I was commanded with a Detachment of Fireworkers and\r\n  Bombardiers to Liege, and from thence back again to Nearhespe, where\r\n  we fought the battle of Landen, and where our Army was beat, and\r\n  sixty-three pieces of English cannon lost. After the battle I was\r\n  ordered with a detachment of Fireworkers to Sasvangand, in order to\r\n  embark the great Artillery for a secret expedition; after some days'\r\n  labour was ordered back again to the Army encamped at Nuioven, from\r\n  thence into Flanders.\r\n\r\n  1694. \"I went with my Lieutenant-Colonel Browne to the Siege of Huy,\r\n  which place we took from the French in the month of September, by\r\n  capitulation.\r\n\r\n  1695. \"I was ordered with some mortars to follow the Duke of\r\n  Wirtemberg, who commanded a detachment of the Army at Fort Knock\r\n  invested by the said Duke. From thence I was ordered with a\r\n  detachment of the Artillery to the Siege of Namur, which place I\r\n  bombarded with twelve great mortars, and did throw about 4000 bombs\r\n  (into the town, Cohorn's Work, and Terra Nova), before the siege was\r\n  over. The town capitulated in August, and Cohorn's Work and Terra\r\n  Nova in September.\r\n\r\n  1696. \"Nothing material was done this year but making intrenchments,\r\n  marching, and counter-marching with the Army.\r\n\r\n  1697. \"This year was like the former till we encamped at Brussels,\r\n  where the cessation of arms was proclaimed.... In the month of\r\n  September the Army marched into quarters, where the greatest part of\r\n  the Artillery people were ordered to England, foreigners excepted,\r\n  who were all discharged except myself and one by name Schlunt. I was\r\n  ordered to embark all the English Artillery remaining in Flanders to\r\n  be sent to England. I myself went with the last embarkation in the\r\n  month of February.\"\r\n\r\n  1698 to 1701. \"I remained in England without being in any action.\r\n\r\n  1702. \"I was made Major to the Artillery in the bomb vessels sent on\r\n  the expedition to Cadiz, under the command of His Grace the Duke of\r\n  Ormond and Admiral Rooke. In this expedition I bombarded with five\r\n  bomb vessels, first, St. Catharina, with such success that it\r\n  capitulated. I also bombarded with some land mortars the Fort\r\n  Matagorde. At our arrival at Vigo, I bombarded with three bomb\r\n  vessels Fort Durand, which was taken sword in hand by the land\r\n  forces. The Fleet entered and broke the boom which was laid over the\r\n  entrance of the harbour near the said Fort, took and destroyed all\r\n  the ships of war, galleons, &c., to the number of thirty-seven.\r\n\r\n  1703. \"Went as voluntier to Flanders. After some months' stay was\r\n  recalled to England in order to command the English Artillery\r\n  ordered to Portugall, with this present Emperour, being at that time\r\n  King of Spain. Two of the transports laden with stores under my\r\n  command were lost in the great storm in the Downs, where myself then\r\n  rode, and was afterwards obliged to go to Portsmouth to repair the\r\n  damage we had received by that storm.\r\n\r\n  1704. \"Nothing material done with the Army but marching and counter-\r\n  marching.\r\n\r\n  1705. \"I was at the Siege of Valencia d'Alcantra, which the English\r\n  took from the Spaniards sword in hand. At this siege, in building\r\n  the Battery, I had my left arm shot to pieces.\r\n\r\n  1706. \"I was at the Siege of Alcantra, which place the English and\r\n  Allies took by capitulation in the month of April. Here I received a\r\n  contused wound on my left breast. Marched from thence to Corea and\r\n  Plazencia. Both towns declared for King Charles, and from thence\r\n  marched to the Bridge of Almaraz, and so back to Corea and to Ciudad\r\n  Rodrigo, which place we besieged and took by capitulation in the\r\n  month of May. Marched from thence to the Town Salamanca, which place\r\n  declared for King Charles: from thence to Madrid, which likewise\r\n  declared for King Charles, where we encamped ten days. From Madrid\r\n  we marched to Guadalaxara; from thence to Guadraka, where I\r\n  cannonaded in the month of August for two days together the Duke of\r\n  Berwick's Army; from thence marched back to Guadalaxara, and so on\r\n  to St. Jonne, from which place we retreated into the kingdom of\r\n  Valencia, where the enemy followed us close till we had got over the\r\n  pass at Raguina.\r\n\r\n  1707. \"In the month of April we marched from Valencia to the Battle\r\n  of Almanza, where our Army was totally routed, and the remaining\r\n  part retreated to Toroza in Catalonia. In this battle we lost all\r\n  the Portuguese Artillery, and most part of the Artillery people were\r\n  taken prisoners or cut to pieces; and I had the misfortune to lose\r\n  all my baggage.\r\n\r\n  1708. \"I commanded the Artillery on the expedition with Major-\r\n  General Stanhope to the Island of Minorca, where we landed in\r\n  September, and after I had built my battery by which I dismounted\r\n  the cannon of two of the enemy's towers built in the line, the\r\n  Castle of St. Phillip capitulated in the latter end of October. The\r\n  whole Island, at our landing, declared for King Charles, and after\r\n  having been three months in regulating the Artillery, I returned\r\n  back to Catalonia in the month of February, 1708-9.\r\n\r\n  1709. \"Marched with the Artillery to Villa Nova de la Barkia, on the\r\n  River Segra, where I bombarded for some days the enemy's Army, and\r\n  after our Army had passed the river, they took the town Balaguar,\r\n  after two days' siege, by capitulation.\r\n\r\n  1710. \"In the month of July I was at the Battle of Almenar, where\r\n  our Army in less than two hours beat the enemy and encamped in the\r\n  place of the field of battle for some days....\" \"From the camp at\r\n  Almenar we marched to besiege the Castle Moncon. We possessed\r\n  ourselves the first night of one of the enemy's works that covered\r\n  their bridge laid over the Cuica river, and continued there some\r\n  days, and at last was obliged to leave the place....\" \"In August,\r\n  marched from thence and passed the said river near Traga in pursuit\r\n  of the enemy to the place of Saragoso, where we fought a battle on\r\n  the 20th August, got a compleat victory, and took the greatest part\r\n  of the enemy's Artillery. Here I received four wounds, and had\r\n  upwards of eighty men killed and wounded on my battery, and above\r\n  300 Artillery mules hamstringed. From this place our Army pursued\r\n  the enemy, and marched to Madrid, which declared a second time for\r\n  King Charles. Two months after, I was carried thither, and from\r\n  thence ordered to Toledo to put that Artillery, &c., we had taken\r\n  from the enemy in order; and after some days' stay was ordered to\r\n  destroy the said Artillery, and march to joyn part of the Army in\r\n  camp at St. Jonne, from whence we marched in the month of December,\r\n  and joyned the whole Army near Villa Viciosa, where we fought a\r\n  battle the 10th December with the loss of all our Artillery, and\r\n  were obliged to retreat into the Kingdom of Arragon. I was wounded\r\n  with a cannon-shot in my left leg, lost all my baggage, and was\r\n  taken prisoner in the town of Siguenca.\r\n\r\n  1711. \"I obtained leave upon my parole to go to England, to be cured\r\n  of my wound; and after my arrival had the good fortune to be\r\n  exchanged for another Colonel belonging to the enemy.\r\n\r\n  1713. \"I made pleasure fireworks which were burnt on River Thames in\r\n  the month of August, over against Whitehall, on the Thanksgiving Day\r\n  for the Peace made at Utrecht.\r\n\r\n  1715. \"In the month of December I was ordered with a train of\r\n  Artillery to Scotland, and arrived in the month of February in the\r\n  Firth of Forth by Leith, where I was ordered by His Grace the Duke\r\n  of Argyle to send the vessells with the Artillery to a place called\r\n  Innerkithen till further orders, and to march with all the officers\r\n  and Artillery people from Edinburgh to Stirling. At Stirling I was\r\n  ordered by His Grace to take upon me the command of fifteen pieces\r\n  of cannon ordered from Edinburgh, &c., for field service, which was\r\n  in such confusion as cannot be expressed; part of which Artillery I\r\n  brought so far as the town of Dundee, where I was ordered to bring\r\n  the Train back again to Edinburgh by water.\r\n\r\n  1716. \"In the month of March I was ordered by General Cadogan, in\r\n  His Grace the Duke of Argyle's absence, to send the vessells with\r\n  the Artillery back again to London, and the Train people to march\r\n  from thence. On our arrivall at London, I was ordered by the Board\r\n  of Ordnance to lay before them tables and draughts of all natures of\r\n  brass and iron cannon, mortars, &c., which was done accordingly and\r\n  approved of. After the said draughts, two 24-pounder brass cannon\r\n  were ordered to be cast by Mr. Bagley in his Foundry at Windmill\r\n  Hill, at the casting of which I was ordered to be present. In the\r\n  founding, the metal of one of the gunns blow'd into the air, burnt\r\n  many of the spectators, of which seventeen dy'd out of twenty-five\r\n  persons, and myself received four wounds.\r\n\r\n  1717, 1718. \"The Board came to a resolution to regulate what was\r\n  wanting to compleat a compleat Artillery for sea and land service. I\r\n  had an order to lay before them draughts of all natures of\r\n  carriages, wheels, trucks, grapes, and matted shot, and all sorts of\r\n  bombs both great and small for land and sea service, with a great\r\n  many other things relating to an Artillery too tedious to mention,\r\n  which they approved of. I likewise laid before the Board the ill-\r\n  state of the Laboratory, which the Board order'd me to put in some\r\n  better order, and to be at as little expence as possible, which I\r\n  did accordingly.\r\n\r\n  1719. \"I was ordered on the expedition to Vigo, which place I\r\n  bombarded with forty-six great and small mortars of my own\r\n  projection, which answered their intended end, of which my Lord\r\n  Cobham, and the rest of the generall officers can give a better\r\n  account than myself, by which bombardment the Castle of Vigo was\r\n  obliged in the month of October to surrender.\r\n\r\n  1720 to 1722. \"I attended the Service, as formerly, at all surveys,\r\n  &c., relating to the Artillery till such time Colonel Armstrong was\r\n  made Surveyor, after which time, notwithstanding His Majesty's\r\n  signification to me for regulating the Artillery for sea and land\r\n  service, I was never consulted in anything relating to the said\r\n  service.\r\n\r\n  \"His late Majesty was graciously pleased to renew my old commission\r\n  as Colonel, and to give me the command of the Regiment of Artillery\r\n  established for His service, consisting of four companys.\"[9]\r\n\r\n\r\n   DATE OF LIEUT.-GENERAL BORGARD'S COMMISSIONS, AND BY WHOM SIGNED.\r\n\r\n ────────┬─────────────────────────────────┬──────────────┬─────────────\r\n Order of│        IN WHAT STATION.         │   Date of    │   By whom\r\n Commis- │                                 │ Commission.  │   Signed.\r\n  sions. │                                 │              │\r\n ────────┼─────────────────────────────────┼──────────────┼─────────────\r\n        1│Served one campaign in the       │              │\r\n         │  Artillery in Flanders as       │              │\r\n         │  Firemaster, having no          │              │\r\n         │  Commission                     │              │\r\n        1│Firemaster                       │   March, 1693│Lord Sidney.\r\n        2│Captain and Adjutant             │ 1 Jan.,  1695│Lord Romney.\r\n        3│Engineer                         │27 March, 1698│\r\n        4│Major of the Artillery           │ 4 April, 1702│Duke of\r\n         │                                 │              │  Marlboro'.\r\n        5│Major and Commander-in-Chief to  │          1703│\r\n         │  Portugal                       │              │\r\n         │  Both of these Commissions lost │              │\r\n         │  at the Battle of Almanza.      │              │\r\n        6│Lieut.-Colonel of Artillery      │          1704│\r\n         │  Both of these Commissions lost │              │\r\n         │  at the Battle of Almanza.      │              │\r\n        7│Colonel of Foot                  │14 April, 1705│Lord\r\n         │  Both of these Commissions lost │              │  Galloway.\r\n         │  at the Battle of Villa Viciosa.│              │\r\n        8│Colonel of Artillery             │27 Nov.,  1706│\r\n         │  Both of these Commissions lost │              │\r\n         │  at the Battle of Villa Viciosa.│              │\r\n        9│Chief Firemaster of England      │ 9 Aug.,  1712│Lord Rivers.\r\n Signifi-│Assistant to the Surveyor of the │25 April, 1718│H.M.

They were, however, decided upon at the date referred\r\n  to in Colonel Borgard's diary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n                        TWENTY YEARS. 1722-1741.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWENTY years, during which Englishmen made no conquests; but during\r\nwhich they had \"peace, ease, and freedom; the Three per Cents, nearly at\r\npar; and wheat at five- and six-and-twenty shillings a quarter.\"[10]\r\n\r\nTwenty years, during which England's army did not exceed 26,000 men;\r\nwhen there was actually a war of succession in Europe, and our rulers\r\ndid not interfere; during which our King could go to Hanover for a\r\ncouple of years, and the coach of the State move on steadily and without\r\ninterruption in his absence; and during which our only alarms of war\r\nwere two in number, and speedily disappeared.\r\n\r\nIt was a favourable childhood for the Regiment; it gave time for the old\r\nestablishments to dwindle away, and the new one to acquire consistency\r\nand strength with the funds which thus became available at the Ordnance;\r\ninstruction to officers and men could be deliberately and systematically\r\ngiven; discipline could be learnt; the fortifications could be armed;\r\nand the defects of the original scheme of organization in the Regiment\r\ncould be ascertained and quietly remedied, instead of being more rudely\r\nexposed in time of war.\r\n\r\nOnly three events occurred between 1722 and 1741, which are worthy of\r\ncomment; but there are details connected with the every-day life of the\r\nRoyal Artillery during that period, which, though unworthy of being\r\ncalled events, yet cannot but be interesting to the student.\r\n\r\nThe first was the camp at Hyde Park, in 1723, which was attended by a\r\ntrain of Artillery.\r\n\r\nThe second was in 1727, when the Spaniards laid siege to Gibraltar; a\r\nsiege, however, which only lasted four months.\r\n\r\nThe third was in the same year, when the States-General of Holland,\r\nbecoming nervous lest an attempt should be made on the Netherlands,\r\ncalled upon England to hold in readiness the contingent of 10,000, which\r\nshe was bound by treaty to furnish, if required. For this, a train of\r\nArtillery was ordered to be prepared, and although not required, pacific\r\ncounsels having prevailed in Europe, its constitution is worthy of\r\nmention.\r\n\r\nIn the camp at Hyde Park, held the year after the Regiment obtained its\r\nColonel, probably for the amusement of the Londoners, there was a train\r\nof Artillery of twenty pieces of Ordnance, comprising two 6-pounders,\r\nfour 3-pounders, and fourteen 1½-pounders. This battery was horsed by\r\nseventy-six horses, but the detail to the various natures of Ordnance\r\ncannot be traced. The officers and men attached to the battery were as\r\nfollows: 1 captain, 1 lieutenant, 1 fireworker, 2 sergeants, 4 corporals\r\nand bombardiers, 20 gunners, 40 matrosses, and two drummers.\r\n\r\nThe Infantry was called upon to furnish a guard over the guns when\r\nparked, of twenty-five men. Six regiments of Dragoons, and twelve of\r\nInfantry of the Line, attended the camp.\r\n\r\nIn 1727, the bad feeling, which had for some time existed between\r\nEngland and Spain, produced an open rupture. A force of 20,000 Spaniards\r\nbesieged Gibraltar, opening their trenches on the 11th of February. By\r\nmeans of reinforcements from England and Minorca, the garrison was\r\nincreased to 6000 men, and the bomb-vessels, which were sent from\r\nEngland and from other parts of the Mediterranean, rendered great\r\nassistance by enfilading the enemy's entrenchments. The siege was raised\r\non the 23rd June, having only lasted four months, during which time the\r\nSpanish loss had been great, while that of the English had been\r\ninconsiderable. With the reinforcements from England had come some guns\r\nand stores, which assisted to make the fort more easily defended, its\r\nprevious armament having been but indifferent. Colonel Jonas Watson\r\ncommanded the Royal Artillery during the siege, having arrived for that\r\npurpose from England, accompanied by Captain Hughes and some young\r\nofficers. The force under his command was two hundred in number. The\r\nonly Artillery officer killed during the siege was Captain-Lieutenant\r\nHolman.\r\n\r\nIn this the first defensive operation in which the Royal Regiment of\r\nArtillery was engaged—as in its first offensive at Vigo—it was on the\r\nsuccessful side. And in both cases, it not merely represented, but it\r\n_was_ the principal arm of the English forces. The next event, the third\r\nproposed to be chronicled, took place in the same year. The train which\r\nit was deemed probable would have to proceed to Flanders was for field,\r\nnot garrison service. It comprised four 6-pounders, twelve 3-pounders,\r\nand eight 1½-pounders. There were also six Royal mortars to be provided.\r\nA complete company of Artillery—with the exception of the cadets of the\r\ncompany, and nine of its bombardiers—attended the train, and 12\r\nartificers and 22 pontoon-men, under a bridgemaster, were also ordered\r\nto accompany it. Conductors and commissaries were also included. Unless,\r\nhowever, it was proposed to enlist foreign Artillerymen into the British\r\nservice, on landing in the Continent,—the staff of the train seems\r\ncertainly excessive.\r\n\r\nFor a total of 140 of all ranks—smaller than a single battery now—the\r\nfollowing staff was detailed: 1 colonel, 1 comptroller, 1 paymaster, 1\r\nadjutant, 1 chaplain, 1 quartermaster, 1 commissary of stores, 1 waggon\r\nmaster, 1 surgeon, 1 assistant-surgeon, 1 assistant provost-marshal, 1\r\nkettledrummer and his coachman.\r\n\r\nThese, then, were the three military events of most note during the\r\ntwenty years ending in 1741; and they are certainly not such as to\r\naffect the peaceable reputation of the period. An unhappy expedition to\r\nthe West Indies, under Lord Cathcart, was ordered in 1741, but as it was\r\nnot completed until later, it can be alluded to more fully in a\r\nsucceeding chapter.\r\n\r\nBut the domestic life of the Regiment during this time requires\r\ndescription. The rank of Captain-Lieutenant had been introduced in 1720,\r\nand the third and fourth Lieutenant of a company were called Lieutenants\r\nand Fireworkers, the conjunction being speedily dropped. The strength of\r\na company was during this period as follows:—\r\n\r\n                           Captain.\r\n                           Captain-Lieutenant.\r\n                           First Lieutenant.\r\n                         2 Second Lieutenants.\r\n                         4 Fireworkers.\r\n                         3 Sergeants.\r\n                         3 Corporals.\r\n                        12 Bombardiers.\r\n                        25 Gunners.            }\r\n                         5 Cadet-Gunners.      }\r\n                        43 Matrosses.          }\r\n                         5 Cadet-Matrosses.    }\r\n                         2 Drummers.\r\n\r\nThe annual pay of each company amounted to 2956_l._ 10_s._\r\n\r\nIt was in 1727, that the Regiment was increased to four complete\r\ncompanies. The siege of Gibraltar suggested an augmentation which the\r\ndeclining numbers on the old establishment admitted of the Board\r\ncarrying out. On this taking place, the staff requisite for the Regiment\r\nwas added, and Colonel Borgard was styled Colonel-Commandant.\r\n\r\nThe staff consisted, in addition to the Colonel, of a Lieutenant-\r\nColonel—Jonas Watson; a Major—William Bousfield; an Adjutant, a\r\nQuartermaster, and a Bridge-Master. To meet the demand for the more\r\nscientific element in the new companies, one Second Lieutenant and one\r\nFireworker per company were transferred from the old, and the number of\r\nbombardiers and gunners in each reduced to eight and twenty\r\nrespectively. The matrosses, as being more easily obtained, and\r\nrequiring less special training, were increased to sixty-four per\r\ncompany; and from this time vacancies among the gunners were filled by\r\nthe most deserving matrosses.\r\n\r\nThe large number of junior officers and of bombardiers in each company\r\nwas intended to meet the demands of the bomb-service, which even in this\r\npeaceable time were very heavy: more especially for the bomb-vessels in\r\nthe Mediterranean. It created, however, an evil which must always be\r\nfound in a profession where the junior ranks so greatly outnumber the\r\nsenior, and where the prizes are so few, while the candidates are many;—\r\nthe evil of slow promotion and even stagnation, and in their wake,\r\ndiscontent, loss of zeal, and, at last, indifference. So soon did this\r\nmanifest itself, that by reducing the number of junior officers, and\r\nincreasing that of the seniors, it has been repeatedly attempted to\r\nremedy it; the last attempt being so recent as during the tenancy of the\r\npresent Secretary of State for War—Mr. Cardwell. But this remedy has its\r\nlimits. There are duties to be performed suitable only to inferior\r\nmilitary rank, and the performance of which, by senior officers, would\r\nhave the effect of degrading the rank to which they may have attained. A\r\nconsiderable proportion of an army's officers, therefore, must always\r\nhold inferior military rank; but whether the evil which accompanies\r\nstagnation in their ranks is to be remedied by increase of pay in\r\nproportion to service, or by enforced retirement in the upper ranks, is\r\none of those questions which it is not for the historian to argue.\r\n\r\nThe Captains of the four companies of the Regiment after the\r\naugmentation were\r\n\r\n                          Captain JAMES RICHARDS,\r\n                          Captain THOMAS HUGHES,\r\n                          Captain JAMES DEAL,\r\n                      and Captain THOMAS PATTISON.\r\n\r\nThe first-mentioned two were at Woolwich with their companies, although\r\ncompelled to furnish detachments for Scotland and the bombs; the third\r\nwas at Gibraltar, and the fourth in Minorca. Special establishments\r\nstill existed for Annapolis and Placentia. The pay per diem of an\r\nArtillery Captain was 10_s._\r\n\r\nIt was in Minorca that the question of the military precedence of\r\nArtillery officers was first authoritatively settled. The officers of\r\nthe four Infantry Regiments stationed there having refused to sit on\r\ncourts-martial on the same terms as the officers of the train, the\r\nmatter was referred to England, and by order of the King the Secretary\r\nat War informed the commandant at Port Mahon that whenever any of the\r\nArtillery were being tried, the officers of the train were to sit and\r\nvote with other officers of the Army, according to the dates of their\r\ncommissions.\r\n\r\nThe objection taken by the Infantry officers was doubtless based on the\r\nfact that until 1751 the commissions of Artillery officers under the\r\nrank of field officer were signed by the Master-General, not by the\r\nKing. This decision, however, settled the point effectually; and ten\r\nyears later there is a record of the trial by court-martial in London of\r\na deserter from the Artillery in which all the members of the Court were\r\nofficers of the Guards, and the president belonged to the Artillery.\r\n\r\nAmong the places which were supplied with additional armament during\r\nthis time of rest were Berwick, Plymouth, Portsmouth, and Hull, but the\r\ncharge of the Ordnance and Stores still remained in the hands of the\r\nmaster-gunners and gunners of Garrisons, numbering at this time\r\nrespectively 41 and 178. The value of these officials may be estimated\r\nby a description of certain accepted candidates for the appointment in\r\n1725, who were \"superannuated and disabled gunners, who have served long\r\nand well, and being too feeble for active service, are subsisted until\r\nthey can be placed in the garrisons.\"\r\n\r\nAn augmentation to the companies was commenced in 1739, but not\r\ncompleted until the following year, when one new company was raised; the\r\nstrength of the companies at home being increased to 150, and of those\r\nat Minorca and Gibraltar to 100. It was 1741 before the distribution of\r\nthe companies at home was finally arranged; for it was found necessary\r\nto divide the three into four, for purposes of relief and detachment. At\r\nthis time,—the end of the twenty years, the strength of the Regiment at\r\nhome, in addition to the companies abroad, amounted to thirty-five\r\nofficers, eighty non-commissioned officers, of whom fifty-six were\r\nbombardiers, twenty miners, ninety-two gunners, thirty-two pontoon-men,\r\n184 matrosses, and eight drummers.\r\n\r\nThere were also sixteen cadet-gunners, and sixteen cadet-matrosses, the\r\nnumber in each of the four home companies having been reduced to four.\r\nIt was from the cadets that the lieutenant-fireworkers were generally,\r\nalthough not always, chosen. The employment of officers of that rank on\r\nboard the bomb-vessels without superior officers above them rendered it\r\nnecessary often to promote non-commissioned officers, whose experience\r\nwould enable them to carry on such an independent service, better than\r\nthe young and inexperienced fireworkers, just promoted from among the\r\ncadets. The discipline among these young gentlemen may be gathered from\r\nthe marginal remarks of the commanding officer on the muster-rolls of\r\nthe two companies at Woolwich in 1739. After alluding to one officer as\r\nhaving been lame for six months, and to another as having lost his\r\nmemory, and done no duty for seven years, he comes to the cadets of the\r\ncompanies. Out of the whole number of sixteen, there is a remark against\r\nthe names of no less than nine, \"I know not where they are,\" and against\r\nanother, \"A very idle fellow!\" The remaining six were detached, two at\r\nPortsmouth, one in the Tower, one on board the bombs, and only two at\r\nWoolwich.\r\n\r\nThere is in the same list a remark made against the name of one,\r\nCaptain-Lieutenant George Minnies, which might justly have been made\r\nagainst others of the same rank in later days, if indeed it may not also\r\nhave to be made again, \"old and worn-out in the service.\"\r\n\r\nThe end of this period brings us near to that time when the Regiment,\r\nhaving quitted the nursery, so to speak, entered the school of war,\r\nwhich was provided for it in Flanders. Before, however, tracing its\r\nstory then, it will be well to describe some little matters connected\r\nwith the foundation and early history of an institution which was\r\nfounded in 1741, the last of our twenty years, to meet a want, which the\r\nabove comments of the commanding officer must prove most distinctly to\r\nhave existed.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 10:\r\n\r\n  Thackeray.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X.\r\n               FOUNDATION OF THE ROYAL MILITARY ACADEMY.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM what was mentioned in the last chapter, it will be seen that there\r\nwere cadets long before there was an Academy. Although, however, this\r\ninstitution is of a date so long posterior to the formation of the\r\nRegiment, and although by many of the practical officers serving when it\r\nwas founded, who had acquired their knowledge in the school of\r\nexperience, it was looked upon very coldly, as a useless and undesirable\r\ninnovation,—yet no History of the Royal Artillery would be complete\r\nwithout some reference to its early days. For, although often\r\nmismanaged, and even now almost paralysed as an Artillery school by the\r\nmarvellous arrangement under which the best Artillery scholars are\r\ninvited to join the Royal Engineers, it has yet acquired such a hold\r\nupon the affections of those who have been there, as to ensure it a\r\nprominent place among our Regimental Records.\r\n\r\nThe warrant founding the Academy was issued in 1741. The cadets then in\r\nthe Regiment were to be instructed there, but not these only; it was to\r\nbe available for the professional education of all \"the raw and\r\ninexperienced people belonging to the military branch of the Ordnance.\"\r\nAt first, the sum proposed to be voted annually for its support was\r\nmerely 500_l._, but this was almost immediately doubled, and before 1771\r\nit had reached 1364_l._ 14_s._ From the very first the practical and\r\ntheoretical schools were distinct. The former was attended not merely by\r\nthe cadets, but also by all officers and men off duty; the latter by all\r\nabove the rank of bombardier, as well as any below that rank who had\r\nevinced any special talent, or capacity for study. In the Theoretical\r\nSchool, pure and mixed mathematics were taught; in the Practical School,\r\nthe various gun drills, fortification, laboratory duties, &c. Once a\r\nyear there was performed before the Master-General, or his lieutenant,\r\n\"a great and solemn exercise of Artillery, in which exercise those who\r\nwere best advanced in the several classes shot with different pieces of\r\nOrdnance at several marks according to their different proficiencies, or\r\nproduced some other specimen of their diligence and application in their\r\nstudy of fortification, drawing, &c., when he who best distinguished\r\nhimself in each class was presented with some prize of honour—if an\r\nengineer, officer, or cadet—or some pecuniary premium, if a private man,\r\nas an encouragement.\"\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that from the earliest days there was no finality\r\nin the education acquired by a cadet at the Academy. His training was\r\nnot supposed to cease when he was commissioned. It is well to remember\r\nthis at a time when there are not wanting men to decry the continuous\r\neducation of Artillery officers, and to express perfect contentment with\r\nthe amount of Artillery education obtained at the Academy.\r\n\r\nProbably these very men who deem Artillery an exact and finite science\r\nto be mastered by a boy in his teens, would be the first to protest\r\nagainst the idea that a man could master the intricacies of the stable,\r\nwithout many years of progressive and practical experience. Chemistry as\r\napplied to the service of Ordnance, dynamics, metallurgy, might be\r\nsufficiently conquered at the Academy, or might be conscientiously\r\ndispensed with, but the perambulation of a horse infirmary might go on\r\nfor a lifetime, and yet a man's education be incomplete.\r\n\r\nThe best friend to his corps is the man who denies and scorns such a\r\ntheory. National predilections have made and will continue to make the\r\nhorsing of the English Artillery the best in the world, but the gun must\r\nnot be lost sight of in devotion to the horse. And this once recognized,\r\nfrom that moment an Artilleryman, to be conscientious and progressive,\r\nmust be studious. At the altar of science he should be the most regular\r\nvotary; for gunnery, to be perfect, draws incessantly and largely upon\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the Regiment, an officer might master in a short\r\ntime the requisite details for working his guns. In the present day, an\r\nArtilleryman is unworthy who fails to watch every scientific advance\r\nwhich may increase the power of his weapons, and raise the tone of his\r\ncorps. And to enable the officers of the Regiment to do their duty in\r\nthis respect, no effort for continued exertion and study should be\r\nspared; mutual interchange of ideas should be fostered; and the main use\r\nof Artillery as an arm should not be concealed behind a veil of pipeclay\r\nand harness-polish. The merits which these last-named agents are\r\ncalculated to foster will come almost spontaneously: it is the study of\r\nthe higher uses, and of the scientific progress of Artillery over the\r\nworld, which requires persuasion and encouragement.\r\n\r\nThe Academy, as we have said, was founded in 1741. Not until four years\r\nlater was the cadet company formed. During the interval, as before the\r\ninstitution of the Academy, the cadets were under no discipline worthy\r\nof the name; they wore no uniform, and were so outrageous in study, that\r\none of the occupations of the officer on duty in the Warren was\r\noccasionally to visit the Academy, and prevent the masters from being\r\nill-used, and even pelted. When, in June 1744, the Regiment was\r\ninspected by the Duke of Cumberland, a disorderly mob, without officers,\r\nor even uniform, drawn up on the right of the line, represented the\r\ncadets of the Royal Artillery. Let no man say that ceremonial\r\ninspections are useless. Defects, which are not apparent in every-day\r\nlife, stare one in the face, as one stands behind the individual whose\r\noffice it is to criticise. The readiest critic is he who is most\r\ninterested on such an occasion. He is not the most demonstrative; he is\r\nglad beyond measure if the blot escapes the inspecting eye; but he\r\nremembers. And to such a man remembrance means remedy. Next January, the\r\ncadets were no longer a mob; they were no longer unofficered: they were\r\nclothed, but they were not yet in their right mind.\r\n\r\nIt may be said of the Cadets of the olden time, that they were veritable\r\nsons of Ishmael; their hands were against every man, and every man's\r\nhand against them. They were the parents of their own legislation; _à\r\npriori_ law-making was unknown; and not a statute was passed that had\r\nnot been anticipated by the offence it was intended to curb. The cadets'\r\ningenuity in evading detection was equalled by their talent in inventing\r\nnew methods of annoyance. This talent was too often aided by the\r\nconnivance of the newly-commissioned officers, whose sympathies were\r\nmore with the law-breakers they had left than the law-insisters they had\r\njoined. Hence came threats fulminated against an intimacy between cadets\r\nand young officers, which made such intercourse all the sweeter; nor was\r\nit effectually put an end to until the Academy was removed from the\r\nBarracks in the Warren to a secluded spot at the foot of Shooter's Hill.\r\nThe extreme youth of the cadets in the earlier days of the Academy,\r\ncoupled with the very different views then in vogue as to educational\r\ndiscipline, produced a system of government which was harsh and penal.\r\nThe Royal Military Academy has gone through two stages—the era of stern\r\nrestriction, and that of comparative liberty. The swing of the pendulum\r\nis as certain in military as in civil life. From the days of black holes\r\nand bullying, the reaction to liberty, confidence in a cadet's honour,\r\nthoughtfulness for his comfort, and a system of punishment not degrading\r\nnor unsuited to his age, were inevitable, and have come. So far, indeed,\r\nhas the pendulum swung, that the young officer must occasionally look\r\nback with regret on the greater comfort and the absence of\r\nresponsibility which were characteristic of the older life. The absence\r\nof degrading punishments has been brought about, in great part, by the\r\nsystem of competition for cadet-ships, which, commencing with the\r\npractical class in 1855, has now for many years been universal. Young\r\nmen from public schools, or from private tutors under whom they had to\r\nstudy _proprio motu_, and without the spur of discipline, could not be\r\nsubmitted to the same restraints as the mere boys who were cadets in the\r\nearlier days of the Academy. Nor does their absence lessen the sense of\r\ndiscipline which is necessary in a military body. The sympathy of\r\nnumbers is the strongest wall against which a recalcitrant member can\r\ndash his head, and the result to the head is proverbial. And among\r\neducated youth, past the stage of mere boyhood, reasonable restraint and\r\ndiscipline can always be enforced with full confidence in the support of\r\nthe governed.\r\n\r\nThe extreme youth of the cadets, in the early Academy days, is the key\r\nto the many ludicrous laws and anecdotes which have come down. For many\r\nyears the average age of the cadets was between twelve and fourteen\r\nyears, and old heads cannot be expected on young shoulders. As a matter\r\nof fact, old heads were not to be found; and the history of the Academy,\r\nover a hundred years ago, is one of the most comic narratives which can\r\nbe perused. The incessant war going on between the Gulliver of authority\r\nand the Lilliputians of defiance, who so frequently got poor Gulliver on\r\nhis back,—the laughable use of unaccustomed power by cadet corporals,\r\nbewildered by their position,—and the grandiloquent appeals of Governor\r\nafter Governor to the feelings of rebellious youth, all combine to make\r\nup a rare picture. We meet threats against cadets who shall pass an\r\nofficer without pulling off their hats, or who shall stay away from\r\nchurch, or shall play during the hours of study. So fond were the boys\r\nof bathing, more especially after it had been forbidden, that no\r\npunishment could deter them, until ingenious authority decided that any\r\ncadet found swimming in the Thames should be taken out and carried naked\r\nto the guard-room. Special punishments were devised for those who should\r\nwear officers' uniforms for the purpose of getting past the guard at the\r\nWarren gate, and for those who should break out over the wall after\r\ntattoo, or spoil the furniture, or write upon the walls. Nor is it\r\nmerely the extreme youth of the cadets which is revealed by these\r\norders; it is their incessant repetition, month after month, day after\r\nday, that makes the student detect the utter want of discipline that\r\nexisted. A record remains of a cadet who was expelled for striking and\r\nmaltreating another on parade, in presence of an officer, and \"refusing\r\nto make any concession, although urged to do so by the Lieutenant-\r\nGovernor.\" Two others are described in an official report as \"scabby\r\nsheep, whom neither lenity will improve, nor confinement to a dark room\r\nand being fed on bread and water.\" These two, having openly displayed\r\ncontempt of orders and defiance of authority, were dismissed ultimately\r\nfrom the Academy. Another, on whom the same penalty of expulsion fell,\r\nrather checkmated the authorities by taking with him his cadet's uniform\r\nand warrant, which enabled him to create such disturbances in the town\r\nof Woolwich, that he had to be threatened with the civil power if he did\r\nnot give up the one and discontinue wearing the other.\r\n\r\nBut in the orders which it was found necessary to issue can be read most\r\nsuccinctly the account of life among the earlier cadets.\r\n\r\n\"The Gentlemen Cadets are now strictly forbid to cut or carve their\r\nnames, or initial letters of names, on any part of their desks, or any\r\nway to spoil them.... They are not to spoil their own locks, or those of\r\nany other Gentlemen Cadets, by attempting to open them with wrong\r\nkeys.... The Lieutenant-Governor expects that henceforward no Gentleman\r\nCadet will be guilty of ever attempting to open or spoil any of the\r\ndesks or drawers of the Inspectors, Professors, or Masters, or of any\r\nother Cadet, or even attempt to take anything out of them under the name\r\nof _smouching_, as they may be fully assured such base and vile crimes\r\nwill be pardoned no more. The Gentlemen Cadets are, likewise, forbid\r\nfrom leaping upon or running over the desks with their feet; and the\r\nCorporals are expected, not only to keep a watchful eye to prevent any\r\ndisorder in the Academy, but, by their own good behaviour, to set an\r\nexample to others.\"\r\n\r\nShortly after this order a remonstrance is published, arguing that \"the\r\ncadets have been guilty of a habit of making a continued noise, and\r\ngoing about greatly disturbing the Masters in their teaching; also, when\r\nthe Academy ends, by shutting their desks with violence, and running out\r\nof the Academy hallooing, shouting, and making such a scene of riot and\r\ndissipation, greatly unbecoming a Seminary of learning, and far beneath\r\nthe name of a Gentleman Cadet; and, lastly, during the hours of dancing,\r\nseveral of the Under Academy, whose names are well known, behave at\r\npresent in so unpardonable a manner when dancing, by pulling, and\r\nhauling, and stamping, that the Master is thereby prevented from\r\nteaching. Hence the Lieutenant-Governor assures the gentlemen that\r\nthose, who are anyways found guilty of such conduct for the future will\r\nbe immediately sent to the Barracks, and receive such _corporal_\r\npunishment as their crimes deserve.\"\r\n\r\nYet again in stately language, it is reported that \"it had come to the\r\nears of the Lieutenant-Governor that of late the Corporals have\r\ninflicted a mode of punishment entirely inconsistent with the Rules and\r\nRegulations of the Academy—namely, that of making the Gentlemen kneel\r\ndown on both knees, with uplifted hands, in the attitude of prayer; at\r\nother times placing them in painful and ridiculous postures, rather\r\ntending to excite laughter than to inflict punishment. The Lieutenant-\r\nGovernor henceforward forbids all such modes of proceeding, as also that\r\nof striking the Cadets. On the contrary, when any Cadet is thought\r\ndeserving of punishment, the Corporals may order them to stand sentinel,\r\nor report them to the Master on duty, or, with his leave, march them to\r\nthe Barracks, and report them to the Commanding Officer in writing, who\r\nmay punish them according to their crimes. On the other hand, the\r\nLieutenant-Governor expects the Gentlemen Cadets to obey the Corporal's\r\ncommands equally the same as any other superior officer, subordination\r\nbeing the most essential part of military duty. Lastly, the Lieutenant-\r\nGovernor expresses the highest satisfaction in the genteel behaviour of\r\nthe Company during the hours of dancing, in a great measure owing to the\r\ncare of the present Corporals.\"\r\n\r\nThese extracts are sufficient proof of the youth and unruly habits of\r\nthe earlier cadets. Courts-martial among them were far from uncommon;\r\nand cases of disturbance worthy of the name of mutiny are also recorded.\r\nYet, in the very earliest days of the Academy, officers joined the\r\nRegiment who entered with such spirit and zeal into their duties, that\r\nthey called forth special commendation from their commanding officers.\r\nIn Flanders, in 1747 and 1748, Colonel Belford and Major Michelson\r\nwarmly acknowledged the assistance they received from the young officers\r\nin their arduous attempts to impart to the Artillery Train a more\r\nmilitary appearance than had hitherto distinguished it. And when, some\r\nyears later, we find this very Colonel Belford protesting against the\r\nofficers who joined from the Academy, and wishing that Institution were\r\n\"detached as a Repository for Captain Congreve's curiosities, and that a\r\nnumber of fine young fellows were appointed as Cadets to every\r\nBattalion, and such as were fit for every duty to go upon all commands,\"\r\nwe must bear in mind that, so great had the demand for officers been in\r\nthe years immediately preceding his complaint, that the cadets had\r\nhardly any time to spend at the Academy—three or four months only being\r\nfar from unusual, and, therefore, that the fault lay not so much in the\r\nsystem as in its neglect. A lad of eighteen years of age will be able to\r\nacquire even discipline in a very short time, because he is able to\r\nunderstand its necessity, and he soon becomes a creature of habit in\r\nthis as in other matters. But a boy is always, either from restlessness\r\nor mischief, chafing against restraint, and takes longer time to subdue.\r\nThe extreme youth of the earlier cadets prevents surprise at the\r\nludicrous state of discipline which prevailed, and creates wonder that\r\nthe officers who joined so young, after such a training, were so good as\r\nthey proved. If the truth were known, we should, doubtless, find that,\r\nwhile their intellectual training commenced at the Academy, their real\r\ndiscipline did not commence until they joined the Regiment.\r\n\r\nNot merely did the exigencies of the service curtail the stay of the\r\nearlier cadets at the Academy, but the abuses and jobbery which were\r\nrife in the last century rendered it possible for cadets to be at the\r\nAcademy without any previous education at all. With a proclamation\r\nhanging on the wall that the Institution was created for teaching the\r\n\"Mathematicks,\" we find piteous Masters protesting against the presence\r\nof cadets who could neither read nor write. There were cadets,—not in\r\nthe Academy, but away in their homes,—drawing pay as such almost from\r\ntheir cradle; and not until the Academy had been a considerable time in\r\nexistence was this abuse put an end to. Before the formation of the\r\nCompany of Cadets, the pay of a Cadet Gunner was 1_s._ 4_d._ per diem;\r\nthat of a Cadet Matross was 1_s._ When the company was formed, all\r\ncadets received the higher rate; and ultimately, although not until\r\ntwenty years had passed, the pay was raised to 2_s._ 6_d._ When enrolled\r\nin a company, military duties were expected of them which were never\r\ndreamt of before: they carried arms, and mounted guard, the post where\r\nthe cadet-sentry was placed being generally over the commanding\r\nofficer's quarters. The officers of the company—in addition to the\r\nMaster-General, who was its captain—were a Captain-Lieutenant, whose\r\ndaily pay was 1_l._ 3_s._ 6_d._; a First Lieutenant, with 5_s._; a\r\nSecond Lieutenant, with 4_s._; and a Fireworker, with 3_s._ But it was\r\nnot for some time after its formation that the officers of the company\r\nwere borne as supernumeraries in the Regiment. A Drum-major was also on\r\nthe strength of the company.\r\n\r\nThe number of cadets in the company, which had been almost immediately\r\nincreased from forty to forty-eight, varied with the demands on the\r\nAcademy during different wars. At the end of last century, and the\r\nbeginning of the present, so heavy were the wants of the Regiment, and\r\nof the East India Company's service, that accommodation for cadets had\r\nto be sought for in the various private schools in Woolwich and its\r\nvicinity, and even in the Military College at Marlow. With the opening\r\nof the new Academy in 1806 this necessity gradually disappeared, the\r\nGovernment accommodation being sufficient.\r\n\r\nBesides the cadets of the company, the Academy was attended by\r\nsupernumeraries in the earlier days, who were permitted to study there\r\npending vacancies. Certain students, also known as gentlemen attendants,\r\nwho did not meditate joining the Army, but attended for general\r\neducation, were permitted to avail themselves of the services of the\r\nAcademy Masters by paying the annual sum of thirty guineas. Classics\r\nwere taught as well as mathematics, at the schools in the Warren; and,\r\nin fact, Woolwich was used by these gentlemen attendants, much as West\r\nPoint is used in America by students who recognize the value of the\r\neducation imparted there, but do not contemplate entering the military\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\nThis suggests allusion to the Academy Masters in the olden time. It must\r\nbe admitted that, in point of discipline and obedience to authority, the\r\nexample set by the Masters to the pupils was far from beneficial. They\r\nresented military interference. They brooded over real and fancied\r\nslights. They absented themselves without permission; and their letters\r\nto the Lieutenant-Governor were not unfrequently impertinent. The case\r\nwas at one time serious. But \"Custodes quis custodiet ipsos?\" At last a\r\nman was found to bell the cat; a man of whom we shall hear again—who was\r\nLieutenant-Governor in 1776, before going to command the Artillery in\r\nAmerica—James Pattison. A letter which he addressed to the Mathematical\r\nMasters on the 1st April, 1777, shows the line he adopted; and tells the\r\nwhole story without any explanation being necessary.\r\n\r\n  \"GENTLEMEN,—I have received your letter of 27th March, and the reply\r\n  I have at present to make to it is principally to correct two\r\n  essential mistakes contained in the four lines which compose the\r\n  letter. You say, that at my _request_, you have subjoined your\r\n  opinion on the mode of education in the Academy, and desire me to\r\n  present it to the Master-General in _your names_.\r\n\r\n  \"The case in my manner of stating it is _this_. I signified to you\r\n  the Master-General's being not well pleased at the slow progress\r\n  made by the Gentlemen Cadets in the Mathematics, and asked if you\r\n  thought there was room for any beneficial alteration in the method\r\n  of teaching in your department. Upon which you expressed great\r\n  discontent at the printed rules you are prescribed to teach by,\r\n  condemning them as being very defective and absurd, and mentioned\r\n  several amendments you wished might be allowed to take place. I\r\n  thereupon _required_, not _requested_, you to represent them to me\r\n  in writing, that I might be able to lay them, if expedient, before\r\n  the Master-General; _not_ meaning, as you seem to _conceive_, to be\r\n  merely the porter of them in your names.\r\n\r\n  \"As to the temporary suspension of teaching Latin in the Lower\r\n  Academy, it being by the Master-General's orders, his lordship will\r\n  judge how far the manner in which you think proper to reprobate the\r\n  measure is becoming. I have only to say that, as that branch of\r\n  learning is not in either of your departments, it was no part of my\r\n  directions to you to give an opinion on it.\r\n\r\n                                           \"I have, &c.,\r\n                                                     \"JAMES PATTISON.\"\r\n\r\nBut not merely on matters of public and official importance did the\r\nmasters test the patience of the authorities. Another letter, also, like\r\nthe one given above, deposited in the Royal Artillery Record Office,\r\ngives a glimpse at the private worries over which the Academy Masters\r\nbrooded—and which they inflicted on the Lieutenant-Governors. Two\r\nProfessors had adjoining quarters in the Warren, adjacent to the wall\r\nbounding the road to Plumstead, and a long way from the Warren gate.\r\nFrom one of these quarters there was a communication through the wall to\r\nthe town—from the other there was not. The occupant of the latter\r\ndwelling was, in consequence, a miserable and ill-used man; it was\r\nanother case of Ahab and Naboth's vineyard—and he waxed sick as he\r\nthought of his hardship.\r\n\r\nSo, appending to his letter an elaborate map of the Warren, he addressed\r\nthe Lieutenant-Governor on the subject, begging either for a right of\r\nway through his neighbour's house, or for a new communication for his\r\nown. So quaintly does he argue his cause, that his words are reproduced\r\nfor the amusement of the reader.\r\n\r\n\"For want of such a ready communication with the town of Woolwich, with\r\nregard to my Family, I am subject to much inconvenience. For, the way by\r\nthe gate of the Warren makes the distance to and from my house so great,\r\nthat I can't have the necessary provisions brought to me as other people\r\nhave, by Bakers, Butchers, Milkmen, &c., without great additional\r\nexpense, and many not even for that at any rate. So that I am obliged to\r\nsend my servants round about by all that way, on all occasions, to bring\r\nin all things necessary to the Family. This is not the worst of it; for\r\nall kinds of Family necessaries not being constantly to be bought in the\r\nshops in such a place as Woolwich, many things are brought only\r\noccasionally and cried about the streets, when it is matter of no small\r\ngrief that such things as may then be much wanted in the family can be\r\nheard to be cried immediately behind the house, without a possibility of\r\ncoming at them, but by going half a mile round about, when perhaps the\r\nservants can be least spared to go, and when they do go, it is ten to\r\none they are disappointed by the crier then being gone quite out of\r\nsight and hearing. And besides all this, it is not always that I can\r\nprevail on my good and sober female servants to be willing so frequently\r\nto go through by the Warren gate, as it is next to an impossibility that\r\nsuch persons can pass so many soldiers as are generally there assembled,\r\nwithout sometimes being subject to rencounters disagreeable to them.\"\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant-Governor, who had not merely official troubles with the\r\nMasters to vex him, but had also to listen to such harrowing domestic\r\ndetails as those just given, was not a man to be envied. Even a hundred\r\nyears later, as the student comes on this plaintive picture, his\r\nimagination begins to work, and he sees, tearing his hair in his study,\r\nthe ill-fated teacher listening to the well-known cry, just over the\r\nWarren walls, which told him that some much-loved delicacy was there—so\r\nnear and yet so far.\r\n\r\nThese pages, concerning the early days of the Academy, suggest the\r\ndifference between those days and the present. And in thoroughly\r\nanalysing that difference, the feeling grows stronger that two changes\r\nare inevitable. Inevitable, because the principle of justice is\r\ninvolved; but difficult to bring about speedily, on account of the\r\nstrength of Academy traditions. So long ago as 1792, these traditions\r\nwere strong enough to defeat a scheme for liberalizing the scientific\r\nofficering of the Regiment. Again, in 1855, the same traditions urged\r\nmany to oppose a similar change. And yet, as sure as anything can be,\r\nthe moment that the Universities realize that their sons are debarred\r\nfrom entering the Artillery and the Engineers, by conditions as to age,\r\nand by the long technical Academy curriculum, from that moment an\r\nagitation will commence, which will sweep all obstructions away. In the\r\nearly days of the Academy, the cadets acquired all the education they\r\never had, under its roof; not merely technical, but general. But in\r\nthese later days, the cadet enters the Academy at a more advanced age,\r\nand with a sound and liberal education. Is it absolutely necessary that\r\nhe should spend so long a time as he does there, on the technical part\r\nof his schooling? Would not the officers of the corps be of a much\r\nhigher scientific tone, if they spent a longer time at the University,\r\nand a shorter at the Academy? While admitting the fact that from the\r\nAcademy there have come officers who have so pressed forward with the\r\ngreat army of Science, that they have become Captains and Generals in\r\nits ranks, it would be flattery to say that the Academy could ever be a\r\nrival to the Universities, although it might certainly be an honoured\r\nand useful helpmate. When it is remembered that an officer remains for\r\nmonths in a state of professional pupilage after he obtains his\r\ncommission, in addition to the time spent at the Academy, the question\r\ninstinctively rises: \"Is there not a danger of the technical part of\r\neducation receiving more than its fair share?\" For although it is easy\r\nto add the technical to the general, it is not easy to reverse the\r\noperation; and in the division of a young man's training life, which is\r\nnow made in preparing the officers of the Scientific Corps, there is a\r\ndanger lest we may produce, to a certain extent, scientific soldiers;\r\nbut not what is also wanted in the Artillery of these days—scientific\r\nand highly educated _men_.\r\n\r\nThe other change which must come is in the officering from one source,\r\nof two corps, which are at once sister and rival. At the time the\r\nAcademy was founded, it was never imagined that the small Engineer\r\nelement then in our service was to develope itself into the large\r\nregiment which now exists. Nor was it ever believed probable, that one\r\nof the two Scientific Corps would have such pecuniary advantages over\r\nthe other, as to tempt many into its ranks who might otherwise have been\r\nindifferent. But both these events having taken place, the Artilleryman,\r\nwho sees the best cadets tempted away every year to the sister corps,\r\nmay with justice ask whether he is not paying somewhat dearly for the\r\nrelationship. Without any violent divorce, there must come some friendly\r\nseparation before many years are over; and it is more likely to be\r\nfriendly, if the difficulty is looked in the face at once, instead of\r\nhaving it urged in language of harsh misfortune hereafter. The only way\r\nof maintaining the present system with justice would be by equalizing\r\nthe pecuniary prospects of officers in both corps; but this would be\r\nmore difficult than the obvious remedy suggested above. At present, the\r\ncase stands thus:—in order that Engineer officers may acquire the amount\r\nof Artillery education which will be necessary for them hereafter, they\r\nare educated under the same roof with the future officers of the\r\nArtillery; and the highest and most accomplished cadets in each class\r\nare invited to join the Royal Engineers. This invitation, being backed\r\nby parents who have a natural eye to their children's future income, is\r\nvery generally accepted.\r\n\r\nIn this plain statement of facts, he who runs may read a grievance to\r\nthe Royal Artillery, which may develope itself into a Regimental, if not\r\na national misfortune.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n                           A STERNER SCHOOL.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE same year which saw the foundation of the Royal Military Academy\r\nwitnessed the commencement of a seven years' schooling, which was to\r\nleave an indelible mark on the Regiment. In the West Indies and in\r\nFlanders, as well as in the disturbances at home in 1745, officers and\r\nmen learnt lessons, and acquired an _esprit de corps_, to which they had\r\nhitherto been strangers. It is at once pleasing and amusing to read in\r\nthe old order-books, framed at Woolwich during the years between the\r\npeace of Aix-la-Chapelle and the commencement of the Seven Years' War,\r\nreminders of the school of war and discipline represented by the years\r\nbetween 1741 and 1748. \"The same as we wore in Flanders\" was a favourite\r\nway for describing a particular dress for parade. And the word \"we\" is\r\npoetry to the student, who is searching for signs of an awakening\r\nRegimental _esprit_.\r\n\r\nNo history of a Regiment like the Royal Artillery could be compressed\r\ninto any reasonable dimensions, if every campaign in which it was\r\nengaged were described in detail. It must suffice to sketch the\r\ncampaigns, but to paint in body colours the Artillery's share. The\r\ngradual increase of the proportion of this arm; the occasions on which\r\nit more particularly distinguished itself; the changes in dress and\r\nequipment; and the officers whose services in the successive campaigns\r\nwere most conspicuous; these are the details which will form the\r\nforeground of the Regiment's History. But even these are so numerous\r\nthat most careful sifting will be required to prevent the story from\r\nbecoming wearisome.\r\n\r\nThe same year, then, which saw the warrant issued for the foundation of\r\nthe Royal Military Academy saw also the despatch to the West Indies of\r\none of the most formidable expeditions, both in a naval and a military\r\nsense, which had ever left the shores of England. The squadron consisted\r\nof 115 vessels, well armed and manned, and the troops were in number\r\nover 12,000. The Royal Artillery was commanded by Colonel Jonas Watson—a\r\nbrave and experienced officer, who did not live to return to England,\r\nbeing killed at the bombardment of Carthagena,—and was divided into\r\ntrains for service on shore, and detachments for service on board the\r\nnumerous bomb-vessels which formed part of the squadron.\r\n\r\nThe troops were to have been commanded by Lord Cathcart, but\r\nunfortunately this officer died of fever, on the arrival of the\r\nexpedition at Dominica, and his successor, General Wentworth, was\r\ntotally unfit for the duties which devolved upon him. To this\r\ncircumstance, and the want of harmony between him and the naval\r\ncommander, Admiral Vernon, the ultimate failure of the expedition was\r\ndue. Notwithstanding additional reinforcements from England, so reduced\r\nwas this force in two years by disaster and disease, that not a tenth\r\npart returned to England; \"and thus ended in shame, disappointment, and\r\nloss, the most important, most expensive, and the best concerted\r\nexpedition that Great Britain was ever engaged in, leaving this\r\nmelancholy proof, that if dissension is the misfortune of a State, it is\r\nthe ruin of any military undertaking.\"[11]\r\n\r\nIn reading the accounts of this expedition, more especially of the\r\nattack on Carthagena, there is a positive relief in turning from the\r\npassages relating to the quarrels between the naval and military\r\ncommanders to those painful but proud episodes, in which the obedience\r\nand bravery of the troops and seamen were so gloriously manifested; and\r\nalthough the first service of the Royal Artillery on the Western side of\r\nthe Atlantic was neither profitable nor pleasant, it can be studied with\r\nsatisfaction, as far as their performance of their duties and endurance\r\nof hardship are concerned. As for the blunders which were committed by\r\nthe commanders, the blame must lie with them, not with the executive.\r\n\r\nTo return, however, to Europe. The war of the Austrian succession had\r\ncommenced, and England felt obliged to support Maria Theresa, which she\r\ndid partly by a grant of money, and partly by sending an expedition to\r\nFlanders under the aged Earl of Stair. The force employed amounted to\r\n16,000 men; and the Artillery comprised a considerable staff, three\r\ncompanies, and thirty guns, 3-pounders.\r\n\r\nAt this time the Regiment was distributed as follows:—One company at\r\nMinorca, one in Gibraltar, one at Newfoundland, two at Woolwich, and\r\nthree in Flanders.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Artillery was at Ghent in July, 1742, no military\r\noperations were carried on that year, owing to the backwardness of the\r\nDutch to fulfil their part of the contract; and the English lay in\r\nFlanders, inactive until the following year.\r\n\r\nThe commanding officer of the Royal Artillery, at first, was Colonel\r\nThomas Pattison, and the following is a nominal list of the combatant\r\nofficers who served under him:—\r\n\r\n               Major GEORGE MICHELSON,\r\n               Captain WILLIAM SUMPTER,\r\n               Captain WITHERS BORGARD,\r\n               First Lieutenant JAMES PATTISON,\r\n               Captain THOMAS FLIGHT,\r\n               Second Lieutenant SAMUEL CLEAVELAND,\r\n               Lieutenant-Fireworker JOHN NORTHALL,\r\n               Lieutenant-Fireworker NATHANIEL MARSH,\r\n               Lieutenant-Fireworker THOMAS BROADBRIDGE,\r\n               Lieutenant-Fireworker EDWARD BULLOCK,\r\n               Adjutant JOSEPH BROOME.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1742, Captain James Deal was appointed Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nto the train; Lieutenant Archibald Macbean was appointed Bridge-master;\r\nand Lieutenant Charles Stranover joined as Lieutenant of Miners.\r\n\r\nThe number of non-combatants was very great, and the total strength of\r\nthe companies amounted to eighteen non-commissioned officers, sixty-four\r\ngunners, 140 matrosses, four drummers, and twenty pioneers.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th February, 1743, the train left Ghent to join the Allied\r\nArmy, which was effected on the 16th May. King George met the army on\r\nthe 19th June, and on the 27th was fought the Battle of Dettingen. The\r\nArtillery share in this engagement was small, the chief points of note\r\nin the battle being the gallantry of King George and of the Duke of\r\nCumberland, and the obstinate bravery of the infantry, to which—coupled\r\nwith the blunder of the Duc de Grammont—the victory was due. The\r\nhardships suffered by the Allies before the battle had been excessive,\r\nnor were they removed by success; so it was considered advisable to fall\r\nback on their supplies instead of following the enemy. The guns present\r\nwith the Royal Artillery at the battle were 3-pounders, twenty-four in\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\nIn the following year, 1744, and also in 1745, considerable\r\naugmentations to the officers with the train had been made, many having\r\nbecome available by the return of the expedition from the West Indies.\r\nAmong others, Colonel Jonathan Lewis was appointed Second Colonel to the\r\ntrain: and Captains Borgard, Michelson, and Desaguliers, Lieutenants\r\nCharlton, Bennett, and Macbean, and, somewhat later, Major William\r\nBelford, joined it. The last-named officer was appointed Major to the\r\ntrain, in room of Michelson deceased.\r\n\r\nIn 1744, many of the British troops had been recalled, on account of an\r\nexpected invasion of England; and so greatly did the French Army in\r\nFlanders outnumber that of the Allies, that no resistance could be made\r\nto its advance, and nothing but a diversion on the part of the\r\nAustrians, which made the French King hasten to the defence of his own\r\nkingdom, prevented the complete subjugation of Holland.\r\n\r\nIn 1745, the Artillery marched with the army from Ghent, leaving on the\r\n13th April. The Artillery marched in rear of the Army in the following\r\norder:—First, a sergeant and six miners, two and two; a tumbril drawn by\r\nthree horses with miners' tools; two four-horse waggons, containing\r\nColonel Lewis's baggage; a front guard of twenty-four gunners and\r\nmatrosses; a sergeant and two drummers; Lieutenant Pattison marching in\r\nfront, and Lieutenant Macbean in rear; the kettledrum; Colonel Lewis and\r\nCaptain Michelson on horseback; the flag-gun, a heavy 6-pounder, on a\r\nfield-carriage and limber drawn by nine horses; nine more 6-pounders,\r\ndrawn as above, but by seven horses; one spare 6-pounder carriage and\r\nlimber, drawn by seven horses; twelve covered tumbrils with stores, each\r\ndrawn by three horses; four howitzers with five horses each; one spare\r\nhowitzer-carriage and limber, also with five horses; six covered\r\ntumbrils with stores, with three horses each; ten 3-pounders on\r\n\"galloping carriages,\" with four horses each; a travelling forge cart\r\nwith three horses; twenty-three powder tumbrils; and three covered\r\nwaggons with officers' tents, baggage, &c., with three horses each. The\r\nremaining officers and men marched on the flanks of the waggons and\r\nguns, a gunner marching by every gun, with a match. A Regiment of\r\ninfantry formed the escort, the grenadier company marching in front, the\r\nremainder in rear. It should have been mentioned that in 1744, an\r\nincrease to the armament of the train had been made, comprising ten\r\nheavy 6-pounders and four 8-inch howitzers; and in 1745 another company\r\narrived from Woolwich.\r\n\r\nSome of the orders issued by the Duke of Cumberland, who was in command\r\nof the Army at this time, are curious: \"It is strictly ordered by His\r\nRoyal Highness that none presume to shoot or hunt, whether officer or\r\nprivate, officers' servants or huntsmen; this to be a standing order.\"\r\nAgain: \"Besides the going out of the Provost, there are fifty Hussars\r\nordered to patrol in the front and rear of the camp, and to cut to\r\npieces every man that they may find beyond the limits of the camp.\"\r\n\r\nAt Fontenoy, such of the guns as were engaged did good service, more\r\nespecially those attached to Ligonier's column, which preceded its\r\nadvance, dragged along by ropes, and doing great execution. Had the\r\nDutch troops fought as well as the British, Fontenoy would have been a\r\nvictory for the Allies, instead of a defeat. The loss of the Royal\r\nArtillery was small compared with that of the English infantry. It\r\ncomprised Lieutenant Bennett, one sergeant, one gunner, and four\r\nmatrosses killed; one conductor, two sergeants, one corporal, six\r\ngunners, and thirteen matrosses wounded; two gunners and four matrosses\r\nmissing.\r\n\r\nThe guns actually present on the field comprehended ten 6-pounders,\r\ntwenty-seven 3-pounders, six 1½-pounders,—recently sent from England—and\r\nfour 8-inch howitzers.\r\n\r\nThe officers present at the Battle of Fontenoy were Colonel Pattison,\r\nLieut.-Colonel Lewis, Major Belford, Captains Michelson, Mace,\r\nDesaguliers, Flight, Captains-Lieutenant Ord, Leith, Brome, and Johnson,\r\nand Lieutenants Pattison, Campbell, Cleaveland, Tovey, Stranover, T.\r\nSmith, McLeod, Macbean, Charlton, Strachey, Northall, Maitland, Hussey,\r\nPike, B. Smith, Bennett (killed), Mason, Durham, Knox, Farquharson,\r\nWorth, and Lindsay. Many of these had joined the train just before the\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the Allied Army did not exceed 53,000 men; that of the\r\nFrench—under Marshal Saxe, and inspirited by the presence of the King\r\nand the Dauphin—approached 80,000. Of the British troops 4000 were\r\nkilled and wounded, besides 2000 Hanoverians. Fontenoy was a defeat, but\r\nhardly one which can be said to have tarnished in the slightest the\r\nBritish Arms.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Cumberland withdrew his forces in good order. On the march,\r\nan order which is extant shows a novel means of confining prisoners:\r\n\"The sergeant of miners is to make a black hole _under ground_, and the\r\ncarpenter to make a door to it with a padlock; always to be clean straw\r\nfor the prisoners; and if any sergeant or corporal suffer anything to go\r\nin to them, but bread and water, they shall be tried for disobedience of\r\norders.\"\r\n\r\nIn October, the rebellion in Scotland had created such an alarm that the\r\nwhole of the Artillery in Flanders, now amounting to four companies, was\r\nrecalled to England.\r\n\r\nPrior to their return, however, news had reached the Allied Army, near\r\nBrussels, of the successful result of the Siege of Louisbourg by the New\r\nEngland troops, and, as a symptom of rejoicing, a review of the Army was\r\nordered by the Duke of Cumberland, which is mentioned by General Forbes\r\nMacbean in his MS. diary, on account of a circumstance which can best be\r\ndescribed in his own words: \"The Army was drawn up in order of battle,\r\nand reviewed by the Duke: the Park of Artillery was formed in great\r\norder on a fine extensive plain near Vilvorden: the four companies of\r\nArtillery under arms, drawn up, two on the right, and two on the left of\r\nthe park: Colonel Pattison, Lieut.-Colonel Lewis, and Major Belford,\r\nposted themselves on horseback in front of the park, when they saluted\r\nHis Royal Highness as he passed, by dropping their swords. The other\r\nofficers, carrying fusees, only took off their hats as he passed them.\"\r\n\r\nAt this time—in 1745—a company was sent to garrison Louisbourg, and\r\nanother was sent to Newfoundland, the Regiment at this date having been\r\nincreased to ten companies.\r\n\r\nThe interlude of the Scotch rebellion, which involved the recall of the\r\ncompanies from Flanders, does not require detailed mention. There was a\r\ngood deal of what Albert Borgard would have called useless marching and\r\ncounter-marching in England. The Artillery was successful at Carlisle\r\nand Culloden; very unsuccessful at Falkirk. At Prestonpans, the guns\r\nwere not served by the Royal Artillery, but by seamen. At Falkirk, the\r\nguns were hard and fast in a bog, and were not once in action. As soon\r\nas the peasant drivers, who had been engaged with the horses, saw the\r\nRoyal Army waver, they promptly fled; and of the eight guns which had\r\naccompanied the King's troops, seven fell into the hands of the enemy.\r\nAt Culloden, the victory may be said to have been won by the Artillery.\r\nIn the words of Sir Edward Cust, \"the guns were so exceedingly well\r\nplied that they made dreadful lanes through some of the clan regiments.\r\nIt was with extreme difficulty that the men could be kept in their\r\nplaces to stand this murderous fire.\" The Artillery was under the\r\ncommand of Colonel Belford. Only one company of the Regiment was at\r\nCulloden, the remaining five on home service being at Woolwich, whence\r\nin the preceding winter they had furnished detachments for service in\r\nEngland at Chester, Carlisle, and Newcastle. The guns employed during\r\nthe rebellion were 6-pounders, 3-pounders, and howitzers.\r\n\r\nIt is with pleasure that one turns from the story of civil war, always\r\npainful, rarely glorious, to Flanders again, where two companies were\r\nordered immediately after the suppression of the rebellion. But before\r\ndoing so, it is impossible to avoid mentioning a coincidence which is\r\nsomewhat singular. As in the Scotch rebellion of 1715, the disastrous\r\nunwieldiness, and the indifferent equipment of the Artillery trains on\r\nthe old spasmodic principle, forced upon the country the idea of a\r\npermanent force of Artillery, so in the Scotch rebellion of 1745, the\r\ndisaster of Falkirk forced upon the public attention the folly of a\r\nField Artillery with no assured mobility. In a contemporary article in\r\nthe 'Gentleman's Magazine,' quoted by the author of 'England's\r\nArtillerymen,' this feeling found expression; and as to one Scotch\r\nrebellion the Regiment may be said to owe its birth, so to another it\r\nmay date the first step in advance made by that portion of it intended\r\nfor service in the field. This coincidence suggests many questions to\r\nthe student. Is public opinion necessary to bring about military reform?\r\nAnd is English public opinion on military questions only awakened when\r\ncivil or other war thrusts military blunders in a very prominent and\r\npersonal way before public attention? These questions may be answered\r\npartly in the affirmative, and partly in the negative.\r\n\r\nIt is undoubtedly a consequence of military training, to produce, in a\r\nman's mind, more of an inclination to make the best of what is, than to\r\nsuggest change and improvement. And, further, as change for the better\r\ngenerally implies expense; and as the heads of military, as of other\r\npublic departments, have a particular horror of anything involving\r\nincreased outlay, it follows that suggestions in that direction, made by\r\ntheir own subordinates, are received with scant favour, and the would-be\r\nreformers are deterred in every way from pursuing their inclinations.\r\nBut the public owes no allegiance to its officials; and the wildest\r\nschemes from an outsider receive an attention denied to the most\r\npractical suggestions from those in the employment of a department.\r\nAlthough, therefore, the public is often the father of military\r\nadvances, it must not hastily be assumed that this is owing to a want of\r\noriginality in military men.\r\n\r\nAgain, although civil war in England demonstrated military defects in a\r\nvery special way, it must not be assumed either that these defects had\r\nnot been apparent to soldiers before, or that so strong a measure as\r\ncivil war was necessary to enlist public opinion. Apart from the cause\r\nabove mentioned, which would deter an officer from recommending change,\r\nit must not be inferred that the same delicacy was shown to the\r\npeasantry of other countries, where transport was required for the\r\nArtillery, as to those who were called upon in England for assistance.\r\nMartial law, which would have been rarely, if ever, enforced upon\r\nEnglish peasantry by English commanders, was freely exercised abroad;\r\nand, with this exercise, the want of mobility was not so frequently\r\nallowed to appear. And with regard to the necessity of an actual, bitter\r\nhome-experience being required to awaken public opinion, the recent\r\nFranco-German war proves the contrary. The reports of the value of\r\nArtillery in that campaign were sufficient, without actual and personal\r\nobservation, to awaken in the public mind a strong and unanimous\r\nresolution to perfect that arm in England, such as no government could\r\nhave dared to thwart. When backed by public opinion in England, a\r\nGovernment will gladly make changes involving expense, and in fact, to\r\nrefuse to do so would be folly; but when that public opinion, even if\r\nfoolish and ignorant, is against change or expense, or even indifferent\r\non the subject, the military reformer within the ranks of the Army may\r\nas well beat the air as urge his suggestions. All these considerations\r\nhave to be borne in mind when studying the history of Army reforms.\r\n\r\nThe two companies which went to Flanders in 1746, were under the command\r\nof Colonel Lewis; Captain Borgard, Michelson acting as Major; Lieutenant\r\nBrome as Adjutant, and Lieutenant Stranover as Quartermaster. The number\r\nof subaltern officers with the companies seems excessive, being no less\r\nthan ten, besides three Captain-Lieutenants; but a means of employing\r\nthem was adopted this year, by distributing the fourteen 3-pounder guns,\r\nwhich were with the companies, among the seven battalions; two to each\r\nbattalion under a Lieutenant. This arrangement was ordered on the 20th\r\nJuly, 1746; but it is soothing to the student to find on the 23rd of the\r\nfollowing month this pernicious custom suspended, and the battalion guns\r\nordered to join the reserve.\r\n\r\nIn 1747, there were five companies in Flanders, three having been added\r\nto the Regiment; and the following was the armament in their charge: six\r\nheavy 12-pounders; six heavy 9-pounders; fourteen heavy and twelve light\r\n6-pounders: fourteen heavy 3-pounders: two 8-inch howitzers; and six\r\nRoyal mortars.\r\n\r\nIn 1748, in addition to the above, thirty-two light 6-pounders were sent\r\nfor use with the battalions.\r\n\r\nAt the battle of Roncoux, the want of Artillery was sorely felt by the\r\nBritish, the more so, as the enemy was in this arm particularly strong;\r\nand doubtless this led to the great increase made in 1747, both in men\r\nand guns.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of Colonel Belford to command the Artillery in the winter of\r\n1746, and during the rest of the campaign, produced a marked and\r\nbeneficial effect. Colonel Pattison and Major Lewis were allowed to\r\nretire on full-pay, in January 1748, on account of old age and\r\ninfirmities: and their younger successors devoted themselves to giving a\r\nmilitary appearance to the companies under their command. In this they\r\nwere greatly assisted, not merely by the improved and better educated\r\nclass of officers, now joining from the Academy; but also by an\r\naccidental circumstance which swelled the ranks with many well-trained\r\nsoldiers. It is mentioned as follows by old General Macbean: \"About this\r\ntime, three Regiments of Cavalry being reduced to Dragoons, and the\r\ntroopers having it in their option to remain as Dragoons or be\r\ndischarged, many of them chose the latter; and above two hundred of them\r\nenlisted into the Artillery. From this period, the Regiment improved\r\nmuch in appearance, and in the size of the men, neither of which had\r\nbeen hitherto much attended to; but receiving at once so many tall men\r\nin the corps may be said to have given rise to the change that has taken\r\nplace in regard to the height, strength, and figure of the men which now\r\ncompose it.\" Among other means of training and disciplining the men\r\nunder his command during the tedious months when the Army was in winter\r\nquarters, Colonel Belford devoted much time to practising them in the\r\nuse of small-arms, and in infantry manœuvres, never yet practised in the\r\nRegiment. So successful was he, that the Duke of Cumberland reviewed the\r\ncompanies; on which occasion the gunners of the companies, with their\r\nfield staffs, formed upon the right as a company of grenadiers; and the\r\nmatrosses, with their muskets, as a battalion. There are not wanting, in\r\nthe nineteenth century, men who wish that Colonel Belford's zeal had\r\ntaken some other direction; who think the use of Artillerymen, even on\r\nfield-days, as infantry, is a misuse; and who would remove the carbines\r\nfrom the Garrison Artillery, in order that more time might be allowed\r\nfor their own special and varied drills. There are even scoffers, who\r\nsay that the presence of a body of men in the garrison under his\r\ncommand, armed and equipped like infantry, is more than a General\r\nOfficer can bear; that he is never at rest until he sees this body\r\nswelling his Brigade by another battalion; and that he inspects it in\r\ninfantry details more minutely than in those of its own special arm.\r\nWhatever ground there may be for these complaints, there can be no doubt\r\nthat Colonel Belford was innocent of any desire to divert his men from\r\ntheir own work: and merely availed himself of this, as of other means of\r\ndisciplining and training them into habits of smartness and obedience.\r\nAnd among other things which he borrowed from the infantry, besides\r\ntheir drill, was that of an Officer's Regimental Guard over the\r\nArtillery Park, in addition to the guard furnished by the Line\r\nRegiments, a more important item than it would at first sight appear to\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nTwo Courts-martial, one upon an officer, and one upon a gunner, are\r\nmentioned here, as probably interesting to the reader. Lieutenant\r\nMcCulloch, having been tried and found guilty by a General Court-\r\nmartial, of disobedience to Colonel Belford's orders, was suspended for\r\nthe space of three months, and ordered to make the following submission:\r\n\"I am very sorry I am guilty of a neglect of my duty, and I do\r\nparticularly ask Colonel Belford's pardon, and will, for the future,\r\navoid being guilty of a thing of the like nature.\" Having complied with\r\nthe submission, and Colonel Belford having requested that the remaining\r\npart of the sentence might be remitted, the Duke of Cumberland, being\r\nhighly pleased with the conduct of the Artillery at the recent battle of\r\nVal, was pleased to accede to the request.\r\n\r\nThe gunner, who was tried, had been guilty of insubordination towards a\r\nsergeant, and being formally convicted by a Regimental Court-martial,\r\nwas sentenced to be \"reduced in pay and duty for one month to matross,\r\nride the gun, ask the sergeant's pardon at the head of the Regiment, and\r\nthat the difference of his pay be employed for the use of the sick.\"\r\n\r\nIn reading the accounts of this war between the Allies and the French,\r\none feels how just was the remark of Louis XV. after Val, that the\r\n\"British not only paid all, but fought all.\" On them fell all the brunt\r\nof every engagement, and the discussion and misunderstanding which so\r\noften prevailed among the Allied commanders had no effect upon the\r\nbravery of the British troops. At Val, the Artillery had thirty men\r\nkilled, Major Michelson, Lieutenants McLeod, Farrington, Dexter,\r\nStephens, Pedley, and nineteen men wounded; and twenty-five taken\r\nprisoners. They received the special thanks of the Duke for their\r\nconduct during this obstinate and bloody engagement.\r\n\r\nThe next thing that strikes one is the cool and able generalship of\r\nMarshal Saxe. He had superior numbers under his command; nor did he\r\nsuffer from divided counsels, but these advantages do not conceal his\r\nmilitary talent.\r\n\r\nNext, to the student's mind, the absurdly luxurious way of making war\r\nthen prevalent suggests itself, if the term can be applied to any\r\ncontest where loss of life was so great. It was, indeed, a game at which\r\nthe leaders played; and in the quiet of their systematic winter-quarters\r\nthey devised and matured new moves for the coming season. How changed is\r\nmodern warfare! What a different system is to be read in the stories of\r\nthe trenches before Sebastopol, or the winter encampment of the Germans\r\nround Paris!\r\n\r\nThe war gradually filtered itself away into the peace of Aix-la-\r\nChapelle. After Val came the siege of Bergen-op-Zoom, where fourteen men\r\nof the Royal Artillery were killed; then came winter quarters at Breda;\r\nthen came preparations for a new campaign in 1748; although peace was in\r\nevery one's mind, and the plenipotentiaries to conclude it had already\r\nmet; then came the siege of Maestricht, with its Quixotic ending; and at\r\nlast came peace itself. A peace which brought profit neither to England\r\nnor to France; which could not obliterate the long list on the rolls of\r\neach nation which war had entered in the books of death; which, if\r\npossible, only made the folly of the contest more apparent; and which,\r\nwhile it ceased the actual roll of cannon, and crossing of bayonets, did\r\nnot stop the pulsation of hatred in each nation's breast, which was to\r\nthrob with increasing vigour, until a new and more bitter war should\r\ngratify the unsmothered longings of each. A peace which—with the\r\nsolitary exception of Prussia—seemed to do good, or bring rest to none\r\nbut unhappy Flanders, the battleground of Europe, the victim in every\r\ninternational contest.\r\n\r\nBut a peace, also, which closed for a time that sterner school of\r\ndiscipline in which the Royal Artillery had now for years been studying;\r\nin which there had been officers such as Macbean, Desaguliers, Phillips,\r\nand Pattison, learning lessons, which were to bear fruit in yet grimmer\r\nwarfare, both in Europe and America; and on whose black-boards—blank in\r\nthis respect, when the war commenced—there had now been indelibly\r\ninscribed the words, that \"an Army without Artillery is no Army at all!\"\r\n\r\nBefore closing this chapter, there are one or two points connected with\r\nthe Artillery in the field, which deserve mention. First; the amount of\r\nammunition which was carried in the field with each gun was as follows:—\r\n100 round-shot, and 30 rounds of grape; with the exception of the long\r\n6-pounder guns, which carried 80 round-shot, and 40 grape. Second; the\r\nstores and ammunition were issued direct by the Commissaries to the\r\nofficers commanding Brigades of guns, _i.e._ Batteries—on requisition—\r\nwho had, however, to make their own cartridges, and fix the wooden\r\nbottoms to the round-shot and grape, after receipt. The wooden bottoms\r\nwere made by the artificer, called the turner; and were fastened by the\r\ntinman. Another of the tinman's duties was the manufacture of the tubes—\r\nand of boxes to contain them. Third; luxurious in one sense, as the war\r\nwas, it had its hardships, as the following extract will show:—August\r\n27th, 1746.—\"Arrived at camp after a most difficult march, the Artillery\r\nconstantly moving for four days and three nights without encamping—\r\nnearly starved; through woods, over mountainous country, with the\r\nbottoms full of rapid little rivers and deep marshes. Almost all the\r\nhorses lost their shoes, and men and horses nearly starved. 3rd\r\nSeptember.—Marched from the camp at 3 A.M., and crossed the Maise, 170\r\nyards broad, over the pontoon bridges, near Maistricht. The bridges were\r\ncommenced laying at one o'clock in the morning, and were completed by\r\nseven, when the heads of the column made their appearance. The French\r\narmy was in order of battle on the heights of Hautain, opposite to\r\nVisel, where he supposed we were to pass, with a design to fall upon us\r\nwhen we were partly crossed the river. 5th September.—The enemy attacked\r\nour light troops posted opposite to Visel, on the Maise, and handled\r\nthem very roughly; those that were not killed, being forced into the\r\nriver, where they were drowned.\" Lastly, it is to be noted that, as in\r\nall our later wars before they have lasted any time, the ranks were\r\nthinned by disease and death, and there was a difficulty in replenishing\r\nthem, even with _recruits_. It is to be hoped that the system of\r\nreserves recently organized in the English Army will in future mitigate\r\nthis evil.\r\n\r\nOn the return of the Army to England in 1748, three companies of\r\nArtillery were reduced; the officers being gradually brought in, as\r\nvacancies occurred. Among other customs brought by the companies from\r\nFlanders was that of employing fifers as well as drummers: \"the first\r\nfifers in the British Army having been established in the Royal Regiment\r\nof Artillery at the end of this war, being taught by John Ulrich, a\r\nHanoverian fifer, brought from Flanders by Colonel Belford, when the\r\nAllied Army separated.\"[12]\r\n\r\nSo much for the school of discipline in Europe. But there had been a\r\nclass-room opened in the East, to which the Regiment sent some pupils.\r\nAdmiral Boscawen had been ordered to the East Indies, in command of a\r\nmixed naval and military force, including a company of the Royal\r\nArtillery, under Major Goodyear. The force of the enemy, and the\r\nstrength of his defences, had been underrated; and it cannot be said\r\nthat the expedition was very successful. The ordnance which accompanied\r\nthe Artillery consisted of twelve 6-pounders, six 3-pounders, two 10-\r\ninch, three 8-inch, fifteen 5½ inch, and twenty-five 4⅖-inch mortars,\r\nall of brass. It was at the siege of Pondicherry that these guns were\r\nused, a siege which lasted from the 11th of August to the 6th of\r\nOctober, 1748, when Admiral Boscawen was compelled to raise it after a\r\nloss of over 1000 men. The Royal Artillery lost, out of a total of 148\r\nof all ranks, no less than forty-three, including Major Goodyear, who\r\nfell, mortally wounded, during the siege, his leg being carried away by\r\na round-shot.\r\n\r\nA stop was put to the hostilities by the declaration of peace, but the\r\npresence of Admiral Boscawen enabled him to ratify, in a prompt manner,\r\nthat part of the treaty which restored Madras to the English. Many men\r\nof Major Goodyear's company were allowed, in 1749, to volunteer for the\r\nEast India Company's service.\r\n\r\nBut this expedition has an interest to the Artilleryman beyond the\r\nmilitary operations. Before sailing, Admiral Boscawen asserted his\r\nintention, in spite of Major Goodyear's remonstrances, of filling up, as\r\nCommander-in-Chief, any vacancies which might occur in the company of\r\nArtillery.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Ordnance was appealed to, and most warmly protested against\r\nsuch an interference with its prerogative,—declaring that none of the\r\nappointments made by the Admiral would be recognized by the present or\r\nany succeeding Master-General. Doubtless, the Board was right; and\r\nAdmiral Boscawen, being anxious to retain the favour of all under his\r\ncommand, let the matter drop. With a seniority corps, essentially\r\ndetached when on service, it was absolutely necessary that promotion\r\nshould be general, not local. At the same time, the restraint of the\r\nBoard was irksome—not the less so because just; and the feeling could\r\nnever be agreeable to a commander, that serving under him were those who\r\nowed a special allegiance to another. As time went on, and the military\r\ndepartment of the Ordnance increased, this irritation would become more\r\ngeneral, and the points of difference between Generals and the Board\r\nwould multiply.\r\n\r\nThe wisdom of the change which put Generals and the Ordnance Corps under\r\none head might have been proved by _à priori_, as it has been by _à\r\nposteriori_ reasoning; and this trifling episode between Admiral\r\nBoscawen and the Board is interesting, as showing that, thirty years\r\nafter the Regiment had been called into existence, the Dual Government\r\nof the Artillery was already producing natural consequences. But it is\r\nalso interesting, as manifesting the affection which the Board already\r\nevinced for the child they had begotten—an interest sometimes too\r\npaternal, but never unlovely.\r\n\r\nAn excellent letter from the principal officers of the Ordnance is\r\nextant, urging the claims to Army Rank of the officers of the Artillery,\r\nwhich had been again questioned by some belonging to the other arms of\r\nthe service. The difficulty was, in a very few years, settled by the\r\nKing, in place of the Master-General, signing the commissions of\r\nArtillery officers; but this letter from the Board is interesting, as\r\npleading, on grounds of justice and in language far warmer than could\r\nhave been expected, the claims of the corps which they had created. The\r\nletter bears date 24th February, 1744, and, after quoting the decision\r\nin favour of Artillery officers arrived at by the King in 1724, and\r\nconfirmed in 1735, and mentioning two Courts-martial held in 1737 and\r\n1742, at which officers of Artillery sat with those of the other arms,\r\naccording to date of Commission, goes on to say that, notwithstanding\r\nthese facts, there are not wanting those who deny any military status to\r\nArtillery officers in the field. The writers then state a case, to show\r\nthe absurdity of the view objected to:—\"If a Captain of Artillery, with\r\na number of guns and Artillery people, should happen to be escorted by a\r\nLieutenant of a Regiment on Foot, with a number of men belonging\r\nthereto, the Captain (according to the sentiments of those with whom we\r\ndiffer) must take his orders from the Lieutenant, which he would, with\r\nreason, think a great hardship; for the Lieutenant would not obey one\r\nwhom he deems to be no more than a titular Captain, and who, he is\r\ntaught to believe, has no rank in the Army. And if the said Lieutenant\r\nshould be killed, and the command devolve to the eldest sergeant,\r\naccording to the notion before mentioned, the Captain of Artillery must\r\ntake his orders from the said Sergeant of Foot,—the consequence of which\r\nis so obvious, that we need not enlarge upon it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But further, my Lord, should this opinion prevail, it would be a total\r\ndiscouragement to the officers of Artillery, as well as highly\r\nprejudicial to His Majesty's Service.\"\r\n\r\n\"The ordinary duty and discipline of the officers and private men of the\r\nArtillery is, in every respect, the same with that of every other\r\nRegiment of the Army. The qualifications of Artillery officers are not\r\nacquired by practice only, but are the result of long study and\r\napplication. They must be proficients in several sciences, and Masters\r\nof several arts, which is not required from other officers. They are\r\nsubjected to the Articles of War, and all the penalties of the Act for\r\nMutiny and Desertion, and are equally a part of His Majesty's Forces\r\nwith any other Regiment of the Army. The service of the Artillery is\r\ngenerally understood to be more dangerous and severe than any other; and\r\nalthough they are an essential part of one and the same Army, yet if\r\nthey bear no rank in it, but at Courts-martial only, they are in a worse\r\nsituation and under greater difficulties and discouragements than any\r\npart of the Army; for, let their service have been ever so long,—their\r\nconduct and bravery ever so conspicuous and meritorious,—they can only\r\nrise gradually and slowly in their own little corps, if they have no\r\nrank in the Army, and can never be promoted in any other, which is the\r\nusual and almost only reward of distinguished merit in other officers.\"\r\n\r\nWhile sympathizing with the spirit which animated the writers of the\r\nabove, one may differ as to the nature of the reward they sought for\r\nmeritorious officers of Artillery, in promotion into the other arms. For\r\nmore than forty years after this letter was written this reward was one\r\nwhich was coveted by the senior officers of the corps for the younger\r\nmembers. Doubtless, the intention was to obtain a promotion for them\r\nwhich could not be found in the stagnation of a seniority corps. But, to\r\nthe modern Artilleryman, the promotion which involved separation from\r\nthe Regiment for whose duties he had been specially trained would be but\r\na doubtful reward.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 11:\r\n\r\n  Cust.\r\n\r\nFootnote 12:\r\n\r\n  Macbean's MSS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII.\r\n                      WOOLWICH IN THE OLDEN TIME.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE in the Barracks in the Warren, where the Artillery at Woolwich were\r\nstationed, with the exception of one company, which was detached at\r\nGreenwich whenever the Warren was overcrowded, can be gathered from the\r\nStanding Orders which survive in the old MS. order-books in the Royal\r\nArtillery Regimental Library and Royal Artillery Record Office. A few of\r\nthese orders, extracted from the books whose contents extend over the\r\nperiod between 1741 and 1757, cannot fail to be interesting.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of each company at the commencement of that period was\r\nas follows:—One Captain, one Captain-Lieutenant, one First Lieutenant,\r\none Second Lieutenant, three Lieutenant Fireworkers, three Sergeants,\r\nthree Corporals, eight Bombardiers, twenty Gunners, sixty-four\r\nMatrosses, and two Drummers—in all, one hundred and seven.\r\n\r\nThe uniform dress of the officers was a plain blue coat, lined with\r\nscarlet, a large scarlet Argyle cuff, double-breasted, and with yellow\r\nbuttons to the bottom of the skirts; scarlet waistcoat and breeches—the\r\nwaistcoat trimmed with broad gold lace,—and a gold-laced hat. The\r\nSergeants' coats were trimmed, the lappels, cuffs, and pockets with a\r\nbroad single gold lace; the Corporals' and Bombardiers' with a narrow\r\nsingle gold lace; the Gunners' and Matrosses', plain-blue coats; all the\r\nnon-commissioned officers and men having scarlet half-lappels, scarlet\r\ncuffs, and slashed sleeves with five buttons, and blue waistcoats and\r\nbreeches; the Sergeants' hats trimmed with a broad and the other non-\r\ncommissioned officers' and men's with a narrow gold lace. White\r\nspatterdashes were then worn. The Regimental clothing was delivered to\r\nthe non-commissioned officers and men once a year, with the exception of\r\nthe Regimental coats, which they only received every second year;\r\nreceiving in the intermediate year a coarse blue loose surtout, which\r\nserved for laboratory work, cooking, fatigue duties, &c. The arms of the\r\nofficers were fusees without bayonets, and not uniform. The sergeants,\r\ncorporals, and bombardiers were armed with halberds and long brass-\r\nhilted swords; \"the gunners carried field-staffs about two feet longer\r\nthan a halberd, with two lintstock cocks branching out at the head, and\r\na spear projecting between and beyond them (great care was paid to\r\nkeeping these very bright); a buff belt over the left shoulder, slinging\r\na large powder-horn, mounted with brass over the right pocket; and the\r\nsame long brass-hilted swords as worn by the non-commissioned officers.\r\nThe matrosses had only common muskets and bayonets, with cartouche-\r\nboxes.\"[13]\r\n\r\nThe variations in the dress of the Regiment which subsequently were made\r\nwill be noted in their proper places.\r\n\r\nA few of the orders issued by General Borgard are given to show the\r\ninterior economy of the Regiment in 1743 and subsequent years:\r\n\r\nMarch 13, 1743. \"That the corporals and bombardiers do not drink with\r\nany of the private men.\"\r\n\r\nMarch 29, 1743. \"That if any non-commissioned officer or gunner make\r\nhimself unfit for the King's duty, either by drinking, whoring, or any\r\nother bad practice, he will send them to the Hospital at London for\r\ncure, and discharge them out of the Regiment.\"\r\n\r\nJanuary 30, 1744. \"That no man go out a-shooting, on any account\r\nwhatever.\"\r\n\r\nAugust 15, 1744. \"The Captains to advertise all their deserters in the\r\nnewspapers.\"\r\n\r\nOctober 29, 1744. \"That none of the people go three miles out of\r\nquarters without a passport, in writing, from the Captain or officer\r\ncommanding the Company to which they belong.\"\r\n\r\nFebruary 15, 1745. \"That neither non-commissioned officers, cadets, nor\r\nprivate men go a-shooting, either in the Warren or Country, without\r\nleave of their officer who commands the company to which they belong.\"\r\n\r\nApril 18, 1746. \"That none of the non-commissioned officers strike any\r\nof the men, on any pretence whatsoever; but in case they are guilty of\r\nany misbehaviour, confine them prisoners and report them to the\r\ncommanding officer. That the Sergeants, Corporals, and Bombardiers enrol\r\nin duty all alike.\"\r\n\r\nJuly 22, 1746. \"That the Sergeants and Corporals go round all the\r\nPublic-houses in Town, and acquaint them that it is the General's orders\r\nthat they trust none of the Train people on any account whatever.\"\r\n\r\nOctober 20, 1746. \"That none of the men carry their victuals from the\r\nBaker's or any other weight on their Regimental Hats. That the Orderly\r\nSergeants and Corporals make these orders known to the same.\"\r\n\r\nNovember 21, 1746. \"That the Captains have all their men provided with a\r\nknapsack, two pair of shoes, three pair of stockings, and three shirts\r\nand stocks each.\"\r\n\r\nMarch 2, 1747. \"That none of the men be suffered to go to work in their\r\nRegimental coats, but either in frocks or surtouts.\"\r\n\r\nMarch 16, 1747. \"The men who are taken sick and sent to the Infirmary\r\nare to be paid only 3_s._ 6_d._ per week, which money is to be paid the\r\nnurse for subsistence; The remainder of their pay to be kept until they\r\nare recovered.\"\r\n\r\nJune 16, 1747. \"That none of the officers turn any of their horses to\r\ngraze in the Warren.\"\r\n\r\nJanuary 8, 1749. \"That none of the Lieutenants go to London, stay all\r\nnight out of quarters, change his guard, or any other duty without the\r\nGeneral's or Commanding Officer's leave; that they first apply to their\r\nCaptain or Commanding Officer of the Company to which they belong for\r\nhis consent to be absent, which if obtained, they may then apply to the\r\ncommanding officer, and not before; that if any officer change his guard\r\nor other duty without leave, or does not attend the Parade exactly at\r\nthe Hour of Mounting, or the proper time when visiting the Barracks, or\r\nany other duty is to be done, that the Adjutant report the same directly\r\nto the Commanding Officer in quarters.\"\r\n\r\nFebruary 27, 1749. \"The Roll to be called in the Barracks at nine\r\no'clock at night, in presence of the Officer on Guard, who is to have a\r\nReport made to him in writing of those absent. Immediately after the\r\nRoll is called the Orderly Corporals are to go into Town, and each go\r\nround their men's quarters (those in private lodgings as well as those\r\nbilleted in Public-houses), and make a report to the Officer of the\r\nGuard of those who are absent. The Orderly men are then to go to their\r\nRooms, and the Sergeant of the Guard to lock both Barrack doors, and\r\nbring the keys to his officer, who is to send the Sergeant to open the\r\ndoors at _Reveillé_ beating in the morning. The officer shall confine\r\nany of those men who are found absent if they come in during his Guard,\r\nand report them to the Commanding Officer at his being relieved. But, in\r\ncase they do not come in during his Guard, he is to leave their names\r\nwith the relieving officer. If the orderly men find any men absent from\r\nquarters over night, they are to go early next morning to see if they\r\nare come home, and, if they find they are, to bring them to the Guard in\r\norder to be examined by the officer and give reasons for being absent\r\nthe night before. If the orderly men, in going round, find any man\r\ndrinking in Public-houses where they are not quartered, they are to\r\norder them home, which if they refuse to comply with, are to bring them\r\ndirectly to the Guard, and confine them for disobeying orders.\"\r\n\r\nApril 1, 1749. \"The Orderly Corporals are to report to their respective\r\nCaptains all non-commissioned officers and private men who do not parade\r\nfor church, in order to their being stopped a day's pay, according to\r\nthe Articles of War; and if any man is seen to quit his rank after\r\nmarching from the parade, and does not go to Church, he shall be\r\npunished the same as if he had not paraded, of which the non-\r\ncommissioned officers who go to Church are to report at their return to\r\nthe Orderly Corporals, and they to the Captains.\"\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was immense excitement in Woolwich in the spring of 1749. A great\r\nfirework, made at Woolwich, was to be exhibited in the Green Park, and\r\nthe Regiment, for the first time, was to be reviewed by the King. The\r\nOrder-books bristle with threats and admonitions, and some of them\r\nreveal a power in the Commanding Officer of which he has long been\r\ndeprived.\r\n\r\nApril 16th, 1749. \"The officers and men to be under arms to-morrow both\r\nmorning and afternoon. The officers to endeavour as much as possible to\r\nperfect themselves, both in taking posts and saluting. The captains to\r\nsee that their companies march strong, and in as good order as possible,\r\non Tuesday morning at seven o'clock, in order to their being reviewed on\r\nWednesday by the King. Every man to parade with his arms and\r\naccoutrements as clean as hands can make them; and in case any of their\r\nclothes want mending or buttons, the person so offending shall be\r\nseverely punished. And the first man that is seen drunk, or the least in\r\nliquor, he shall be immediately brought to y^e halberts, and there\r\nreceive 300 lashes, and afterwards be drummed out of the Regiment with a\r\nrope about his neck. The guard to mount to-morrow in black\r\nspatterdashes, and the officers in boots.\"\r\n\r\nAfter order. \"That all the cadets who desire to see the fireworks be\r\nunder arms at five o'clock in black spatterdashes, and their officers in\r\nboots, in order to march by Lambeth to the Green Park. They are to take\r\nwhite spatterdashes in their pockets to appear in.\"\r\n\r\nThe discipline among the cadets may be comprehended from the following\r\norder:—\r\n\r\nOctober 10, 1840. \"Complaints having been made to the Board that the\r\nfollowing persons belonging to the Company of Gentlemen Cadets in the\r\nRoyal Regiment of Artillery have been very negligent of their duty,\r\nviz., Francis Volloton, Archibald Douglas, &c. &c. And that Francis\r\nVolloton has been absent above twelve months, and not so much as\r\nattended the muster, and has otherwise misbehaved himself. It is the\r\nBoard's orders that the said Francis Volloton be broke, and the rest\r\nsuspended from their pay till they show cause to the contrary.\"\r\n\r\nA previous order to that just quoted shows that boyishness was not\r\nconfined to the Cadets. An order, twice issued, appeared on\r\n\r\nJuly 23, 1749. \"That none of the men play at long bullet on Plumstead\r\nRoad, of which they are all to be acquainted.\"\r\n\r\nAugust 26, 1749. \"When any of the men die or desert, the Captain of the\r\ncompany is to put down the day in the muster-roll against his name, and\r\nthe money to be left in the agent's hands from the day such men died or\r\ndeserted for recruiting others in their room.\"\r\n\r\nMarch 14, 1750. \"The Captains or commanding officers of companies are to\r\nobserve that henceforward no man is to be enlisted under five feet nine\r\ninches without shoes.\"\r\n\r\nMarch 30, 1750. \"The Sergeant of the Guard is not to suffer any non-\r\ncommissioned officer or private man to go out of the Warren gate unless\r\nthey are dressed clean, their hair combed and tied up, with clean\r\nstockings, and shoes well blacked, and in every other respect like\r\nsoldiers. The cooks are excepted during their cooking hours, but not\r\notherwise.\"\r\n\r\nMay 9, 1750. \"No subaltern officer is for the future to have a servant\r\nout of any of the companies.\"\r\n\r\nJuly 17, 1750. \"The commanding officers of companies are ordered by the\r\ngeneral to provide proper wigs for such of their respective men that do\r\nnot wear their hair, as soon as possible.\"\r\n\r\nJuly 25, 1750. \"Each company is to be divided into three squads. The\r\nofficers and non-commissioned officers to be appointed to them to be\r\nanswerable that the arms, accoutrements, &c., are kept in constant good\r\norder, and that the men always appear clean.\"\r\n\r\nJuly 25, 1750. \"Joseph Spiers, gunner in Captain Desagulier's company,\r\nis by sentence of a Court-martial broke to a matross, and to receive 100\r\nlashes; but General Borgard has been pleased to forgive him the\r\npunishment.\"\r\n\r\nA General Court-martial was ordered to assemble _at the Academy_ to try\r\na matross for desertion. The Court, which assembled at 10 A.M. on the\r\n20th October, 1750, was composed of Lieutenant-Colonel Belford as\r\nPresident, with nine captains and three lieutenants as members.\r\n\r\nNovember 3, 1750. \"Sergeant Campbell, in Captain Pattison's company, is\r\nby sentence of a Regimental Court-martial reduced to a Bombardier for\r\none month, from the date hereof, and the difference of his pay to be\r\nstopped.\"\r\n\r\nThe death of General Borgard took place in 1751, and he was succeeded by\r\nColonel Belford. This officer was most energetic in drilling officers\r\nand men, and in compelling them to attend Academy and all other\r\ninstructions. Even such an opportunity as the daily relief of the Warren\r\nguard was turned to account by him; and the old and new guards were\r\nformed into a company for an hour's drill, under the senior officer\r\npresent, at guard mounting. From one order issued by him, it would seem\r\nas if the authority of the captains required support, being somewhat\r\nweakened perhaps, as is often the case, by the oversight and\r\ninterference in small matters by the colonel; for we find it was\r\nnecessary on March 2, 1751, to order \"That when any of the Captains\r\nreview their companies either with or without arms, all the officers\r\nbelonging to them were to be present.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Belford's weakness for the carbine is apparent in many of his\r\norders.\r\n\r\nApril 1, 1751. \"All the officers' servants who are awkward at the\r\nexercise of the small arms to be out every afternoon with the awkward\r\nmen, and the rest of them to attend the exercise of the gun.\"\r\n\r\nA most important official must have been expected in the Warren on the\r\n5th August, 1751, for we find orders issued on the previous evening, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"The Regiment to be under arms to-morrow morning at nine o'clock. The\r\ncommanding officers are to see that their respective men are extremely\r\nwell-powdered, and as clean as possible in every respect. The guard to\r\nconsist to-morrow of one Captain, two Lieutenants, two Sergeants, four\r\nCorporals, and forty men.

officers, 61 non-commissioned officers, 57 gunners,\r\n330 matrosses, 80 miners, 7 fifers, and 12 drummers.\r\n\r\nThis train of Artillery left the Tower in July, and remained in Byfleet\r\nuntil October, practising experiments in mining, and the usual exercises\r\nof Ordnance, under the immediate eye of the Master-General himself, the\r\nDuke of Marlborough, who marched at the head of the train, and encamped\r\nwith it. An interesting allusion to a custom long extinct appears in the\r\norders relative to the camp. We find certain artificers detailed for the\r\nflag-gun and the flag-waggon. The former was always one of the heaviest\r\nin the field; and the custom is mentioned in 1722, 1747, and in India in\r\n1750. Colonel Miller, in alluding to this custom in his valuable\r\npamphlet, expresses his opinion that the flag on the gun corresponded to\r\nthe Queen's colour, and that on the waggon to the Regimental colour, the\r\nlatter probably bearing the Ordnance Arms. The guns had been divided\r\ninto Brigades, corresponding to the modern Batteries. Four 24-pounders,\r\nfive 12-pounders, five 6-pounders, and six 3-pounders, respectively,\r\nconstituted a Brigade. The howitzers were in Brigades of three. The\r\ndiscipline insisted upon was very strict. Lights were not allowed even\r\nin the sutler's tents after ten o'clock; no man was allowed to go more\r\nthan a mile from camp without a pass; officers were not allowed to\r\nappear in plain clothes upon any occasion; strong guards were mounted in\r\nevery direction, with most voluminous orders to obey,—orders which seem\r\noccasionally unreasonable. The Captain of the Guard had to see the\r\nevening gun fired, and was made \"answerable for any accident that might\r\nhappen\"—a somewhat heavy responsibility, as accidents are not always\r\nwithin the sphere of control, where the executive officer's duties are\r\nplaced. Whenever the weather was fine, all the powder was carefully\r\naired, and all articles of equipment requiring repair were laid out for\r\ninspection. The powers of the commanding officers of companies in\r\ngranting indulgences to their men were curtailed. No artificer was\r\nallowed to be employed at any time on any service but His Majesty's,\r\nwithout the leave of the Duke of Marlborough himself, or the commandant\r\nin the camp; and should any officer excuse a man from parade he was to\r\nbe put in arrest for disobedience of orders.\r\n\r\nColonel Belford revelled in the discipline of the camp. It brought back\r\nto his mind the old days in Flanders when he worked so hard to imbue his\r\nmen with a strict military spirit, and, with the Master-General by his\r\nside, he felt renewed vigour and keenness. The Regiment was attracting\r\ngreater attention every year; augmentations were continuous. The year\r\nbefore the Byfleet camp was formed, six companies had been added: this\r\nyear there were three more; and in 1757, four additional companies were\r\nto be raised. The King had reviewed the Regiment, and the Duke of\r\nCumberland came to Woolwich every year to inspect and encourage. Who can\r\ntell whether the new organization of 1757, which divided the Regiment\r\ninto Battalions and accelerated the stagnant promotion, did not come\r\nfrom the long days of intercourse at Byfleet between Colonel Belford and\r\nthe Master-General? The opportunities offered by such a meeting must\r\nhave been priceless to a man who was so fond of his Regiment. Nothing is\r\nso infectious as enthusiasm; and we learn from Colonel Belford's orders\r\nand letters that he was an enthusiastic gunner. The early History of the\r\nRegiment is marked by the presence in its ranks of men eminent in their\r\nown way, and perfectly distinct in character, yet whose talents all\r\nworked in the same direction, the welfare of their corps. Who could be\r\nmore unlike than Borgard and his successor, Colonel Belford? And yet a\r\ngreater difference is found between the scientific Desaguliers, and the\r\ndiplomatic and statesmanlike Pattison, the model of a liberal-minded,\r\nhigh-spirited soldier. These four men are the milestones along the road\r\nof the Regiment's story from 1716 to 1783. They mark the stages of\r\ncontinuous progress; but there the parallel fails. For they were no\r\nstationary emblems. Their whole life was engrossed in their Regiment. To\r\none, discipline was dear; to another, military science; to another,\r\ngunnery, and the laboratory; and they drew along with them in the\r\npursuits they loved all those whose privilege it was to serve under\r\nthem. It was in a small and distinct way a representation of what the\r\nRegiment in its present gigantic proportions would be, if the\r\nsuggestions quoted in the commencement of this volume were heartily\r\nadopted by all who belong to it. Out of the faded pages and musty\r\nvolumes which line the walls of the Regimental Record Office, there\r\nseems to come a voice from these grand old masters, \"Be worthy of us!\"\r\nTo them, their corps was everything; to its advancement every taste or\r\ntalent they possessed was devoted. With its increased proportions, there\r\nhas now come an increased variety of tastes, of learning, and of\r\naccomplishments; and the lives of our great predecessors in the corps\r\nread like a prayer over the intervening years, beseeching us all to work\r\ntogether for the Regiment's good.\r\n\r\nIf variety of taste is to produce opposition in working, or dissipation\r\nof strength and talent, what a cruel answer the Present gives to the\r\nPast! But, if it is to raise the Regiment in the eyes, not merely of\r\nmilitary critics, but of that other world of science, across whose\r\nthreshold not a few Artillerymen have passed with honour, then the\r\nvariety of tastes working together, and yet independently—conducing to\r\nthe one great end—is the noblest response that can be made to those who\r\nshowed us in the Regiment's earliest days how to forget self in a noble\r\n_esprit de corps_.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 13:\r\n\r\n  Macbean's MSS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII.\r\n                                To 1755.\r\n\r\n\r\nA NUMBER of interesting events can be compressed into a chapter,\r\ncovering the period between the end of the war in Flanders and the year\r\n1755.\r\n\r\nThe dress and equipment of the Regiment underwent a change. In 1748, the\r\nlast year of the war, the field staffs of the gunners, their powder\r\nhorns, slings, and swords, and the muskets of the matrosses were laid\r\naside, and both ranks were armed with carbines and bayonets—thus paving\r\nthe way for the step taken in the year 1783, when the distinction\r\nbetween the two ranks was abolished. The non-commissioned officers\r\nretained their halberds until 1754, when they were taken from the\r\ncorporals and bombardiers, who fell into the ranks with carbines. In\r\n1748, black spatterdashes were introduced into the Regiment, for the\r\nfirst time into any British corps. In 1750, the sergeants' coats were\r\nlaced round the button-holes with gold looping, the corporals,\r\nbombardiers, and the privates having yellow worsted looping in the same\r\nway. The corporals and bombardiers had gold and worsted shoulder-knots;\r\nthe surtouts were laid aside, and complete suits of clothing were issued\r\nyearly.[14]\r\n\r\nAt the end of the war, the Regiment consisted of ten companies, and for\r\nthe first time, reliefs of the companies abroad were carried out, those\r\nat Gibraltar and Minorca being relieved by companies at Woolwich. The\r\nstrength of the Regiment remained unchanged until 1755, when six new\r\ncompanies were raised, making a total of sixteen, exclusive of the Cadet\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nThe year 1751 was marked by several important Regimental events. The\r\nfather of the Regiment, old General Borgard, died; and was succeeded by\r\nColonel Belford. The vexed question of the Army rank of Artillery\r\nofficers was settled by the King issuing a declaration under his Sign-\r\nManual, retrospective in its effects, deciding \"the rank of the officers\r\nof the Royal Regiment of Artillery to be the same as that of the other\r\nofficers of his Army of the same rank, notwithstanding their commissions\r\nhaving been hitherto signed by the Master-General, the Lieutenant-\r\nGeneral, or the principal officers of the Ordnance, which had been the\r\npractice hitherto.\" From this date all commissions of Artillery officers\r\nwere signed by the sovereign, and countersigned by the Master-General of\r\nthe Ordnance.\r\n\r\nThis year also saw the abolition of an official abuse dating back before\r\nthe days of the Regiment's existence. Up to this time, all non-\r\ncommissioned officers, gunners, matrosses, and even drummers, had\r\nwarrants signed by the Master-General, and countersigned by his\r\nsecretary, for which a sergeant paid 3_l._, a matross or drummer, 1_l._\r\n10_s._, and the intermediate grades in proportion.\r\n\r\nThis was now abolished, with great propriety, as an old MS. says, \"as no\r\none purpose appears to have been answered by it, but picking of the\r\nmen's pockets.\" Doubtless, there were in the Tower officials who would\r\nnot endorse this statement; and who were of opinion that a very material\r\npurpose was answered by it.\r\n\r\nIn February of this year, also, the officers of the Regiment entered\r\ninto an agreement for the establishment of a fund for the benefit of\r\ntheir widows, no such fund having as yet existed. Each officer agreed to\r\nsubscribe three days' pay annually, and three days' pay on promotion;\r\nbut this subscription apparently was felt to be too high, or it was\r\nconsidered proper that some assistance should be rendered to the fund by\r\nthe Government, for in 1762 a Royal Warrant was issued, directing one\r\nday's pay to be stopped from each officer for the Widows' Fund, and that\r\none non-effective matross—in other words a _paper_ man—should be\r\nmustered in each company, the pay of such to be credited to the fund. By\r\nthis means it was hoped that the widow of a Colonel Commandant would\r\nobtain 50_l._ per annum; of a Lieutenant-Colonel, 40_l._; of a Major,\r\n30_l._; of a Captain, 25_l._; of a Lieutenant, Chaplain, or Surgeon,\r\n20_l._; and of a Lieutenant-Fireworker, 16_l._ But, either the officers\r\nwould not marry, or the married officers would not die, for in 1772\r\nanother warrant was issued, announcing that the fund was larger than was\r\nnecessary, and directing the surplus to be given as a contingent to the\r\nCaptains of companies. It is somewhat anticipating matters, but it may\r\nhere be said that a few years later the officers of the Regiment again\r\ntook the matter into their own hands, and formed a marriage society,\r\nmembership of which was nominally voluntary, but virtually compulsory,\r\nuntil about the year 1850, after which it failed to receive the support\r\nof the corps, its rules not being suited to modern ideas. On 13th May,\r\n1872, these rules were abrogated at a public meeting of the officers at\r\nWoolwich, and the society, with its accumulated capital of 50,000_l._,\r\nwas thrown open on terms sufficiently modern and liberal to tempt all\r\nwho had hitherto refrained from joining it. At that meeting, the\r\noriginal charter of the society, signed by the officers serving in the\r\nRegiment at the time, was submitted to their successors, and there was a\r\ndumb eloquence in the faded parchment with its long list of signatures,\r\nwhich it would be impossible to express in words.\r\n\r\nIt has already been stated that Colonel Pattison and Major Lewis had\r\nbeen permitted to retire on full pay, on account of infirmity. The\r\nsource from which their income was derived, and the use to which it was\r\ndevoted after their death, can best be described in Colonel Miller's\r\nwords: \"To this purpose there was appropriated the pay allowed for two\r\ntinmen and twenty-four matrosses, the number of effective matrosses\r\nbeing reduced from forty-four to forty in each company, whilst forty-\r\nfour continued to appear as the nominal strength. At the death of\r\nJonathan Lewis, a warrant dated 25th September, 1751, approved of the\r\nnon-effectives being still kept up, and directed the sum of 273_l._\r\n15_s._ a year (15_s._ a day) then available to be applied thus:—173_l._\r\n15_s._ to Colonel Belford (as colonel commandant), and 100_l._ to\r\nCatherine Borgard, widow of Lieutenant-General Albert Borgard, towards\r\nthe support of herself and her two children, who were left unprovided\r\nfor. When Colonel Thomas Pattison died, a warrant dated 27th February,\r\n1753, directed that the annuity to Mrs. Borgard should in future be paid\r\nout of another source, and applied the balance of the fund derived from\r\nthe non-effective tinmen and matrosses to increasing the pay of the\r\nfireworkers from 3_s._ to 3_s._ 8_d._ a day.\"\r\n\r\n\"In 1763 the increased pay of the fireworkers was entered in the\r\nestimates, and the pay of colonel commandant was raised to 2_l._ 4_s._ a\r\nday.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the period to which this chapter refers, a review of the Regiment\r\nby the King took place in the Green Park; and as it was thought worthy\r\nof entry in General Macbean's diary, and shows the way in which the\r\nRegiment was formed upon such an occasion, it may not be deemed out of\r\nplace in this work. There were five companies present besides the\r\nCadets, and the numbers were as follows:—Field officers, three;\r\nCaptains, five; Captain-Lieutenants, six; four First, and seven Second\r\nLieutenants; Lieutenant-Fireworkers, seventeen; one Chaplain, one\r\nAdjutant, one Quartermaster, one Bridge-master, one Surgeon and his\r\nMate, fifteen Sergeants, fifteen Corporals, one Drum-Major, ten Drummers\r\nand six Fifers, forty Bombardiers, forty-eight Cadets, ninety-eight\r\nGunners, and 291 Matrosses. The companies were formed up as a Battalion;\r\nthree light 6-pounders being on the flanks, and the Cadets formed up on\r\nthe right as a Battalion.\r\n\r\nAlthough there was peace for England in Europe up to 1755, there was no\r\nlack of expeditions elsewhere. Besides Jamaica and Virginia, which\r\ndemanded guns and stores, Artillery was required for the East Indies and\r\nAmerica. It was for service in the former country that the augmentation\r\nof four companies with an additional Major was made in March, 1755.\r\n\r\nThey were raised and equipped in thirty days, and embarked immediately,\r\nthe Board giving permission to Major Chalmers, who was in command, to\r\nfill up any vacancies which might occur, by promoting the senior on the\r\nspot. These companies were in the pay of the East India Company, and\r\nformed part of the expedition under Clive and Admiral Watson. One of the\r\ncompanies was lost on the passage, only three men being saved. It was\r\nCaptain Hislop's company, but that officer had been promoted while\r\nserving in the East Indies, and it was commanded on the voyage by the\r\nCaptain-Lieutenant, N. Jones. As soon as the disaster was known in\r\nEngland, another company was raised, and on its arrival in India Captain\r\nHislop assumed the command. This officer had gone out with five\r\nofficers, sixty men, and twelve cadets, and a small train of Artillery,\r\nattached to the 39th Regiment, under Colonel Aldercon. His new company\r\nwas the last of the Royal Artillery which served in Bengal, until the\r\noutbreak of the Indian Mutiny.[15]\r\n\r\nThe expedition to America was the ill-fated one commanded by General\r\nBraddock. The detachment of Royal Artillery was only fifty strong; it\r\nleft England under the command of Captain-Lieutenant Robert Hind, with\r\ntwo Lieutenants, three Fireworkers, and one cadet; and on its arrival in\r\nAmerica was joined by Captain Ord, who assumed the command. This officer\r\nhad been quartered with his company at Newfoundland; but at the request\r\nof the Duke of Cumberland he was chosen to command the Artillery on this\r\nexpedition. The guns which accompanied the train were ten in number, all\r\nlight brass guns—four being 12-pounders, and six 6-pounders. The civil\r\nattendants of the train were twenty-one in number, including conductors\r\nand artificers; and there were attached to the train—attendants not\r\ngenerally found in such lists—\"ten servants, and six necessary women.\"\r\nThere were also five Engineers, and practitioner Engineers.\r\n\r\nThe melancholy fate of this expedition is well known. The detachment of\r\nArtillery was cut to pieces at Fort du Quesne, on that ghastly July day\r\nin 1755; the whole ten guns were taken; but Captain Ord himself survived\r\nto do good service years after, on the American continent. It will be\r\nremembered by the reader that George Washington fought on this occasion\r\non the English side, and displayed the same marvellous coolness and\r\ncourage, as he did on every subsequent occasion.\r\n\r\nBut events were ripening at Woolwich for great Regimental changes. A\r\nsmall subaltern's detachment left for Dublin, which was to be the parent\r\nof the Royal Irish Artillery, a corps which will form the subject of the\r\nnext chapter. In 1756, a company of miners was formed for service in\r\nMinorca, which, on its return to Woolwich, was incorporated into the\r\nRegiment, and two other companies having been raised in the same year,\r\nand four additional in 1757, there was a total, including the companies\r\nof miners and cadets, of twenty-four companies. The largely increased\r\nnumber of company officers, in proportion to the limited number of those\r\nin the higher grades, made the prospects of promotion so dismal, that\r\nthe Regiment was divided into two Battalions, each of which will receive\r\nnotice in subsequent chapters.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 14:\r\n\r\n  Cleaveland's MSS. Macbean's MSS.\r\n\r\nFootnote 15:\r\n\r\n  Brown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV.\r\n                       THE ROYAL IRISH ARTILLERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Ordnance Department in Ireland was independent of that in England\r\nuntil the year 1674, when Charles II., availing himself of the vacancy\r\ncreated by the death of the then Irish Master-General—Sir Robert Byron—\r\nmerged the appointment in that of the Master-General of England; and the\r\ncombined duties were first performed by Sir Thomas Chicheley. This\r\nofficer appointed, as his deputies in Ireland, Sir James Cuff and\r\nFrancis Cuff, Esq. The Masters-General of the Irish Ordnance, whom we\r\nfind mentioned after this date, were subordinate to the English Masters-\r\nGeneral, in a way which had never previously been recognized.\r\n\r\nEven after the amalgamation, however, the accounts of the Irish and\r\nBritish Departments of the Ordnance were kept perfectly distinct. When\r\nships were fitted out for service in the Irish seas, their guns and\r\nstores were furnished from the Irish branch of the Ordnance. All\r\ngunpowder for use in Ireland was issued by the English officials to the\r\nIrish Board on payment; and the lack of funds, which was chronic at the\r\nTower during the reigns of the Stuarts, was not unfrequently remedied by\r\ncalling in the assistance of the Irish Board. Tenders for the\r\nmanufacture of gunpowder having been received, and the orders then given\r\nhaving been complied with, it was no unusual thing to pay the merchants\r\nwith Ordnance Debentures, and to ship the powder to Ireland in exchange\r\nfor a money payment. The correspondence between the two Boards throws\r\nlight upon the way in which money was found for the English\r\nfortifications, and also gives us the value of gunpowder at various\r\ntimes. For example, in August, 1684, one thousand barrels were shipped\r\nto Ireland; and the sum received in payment—2500_l._—was ordered to be\r\nspent on the fortifications at Portsmouth.\r\n\r\nSome of the debentures issued to the creditors of the English Ordnance,\r\nin lieu of money, were on security of the grounds in the City of London,\r\ncalled the Artillery Grounds, and carried interest at the rate of two\r\nper cent.: others were merely promissory notes issued by the Board,\r\nwhich bore no very high reputation, nor were they easily convertible\r\ninto money. From certain correspondence in the Tower Library, during the\r\nreigns of Charles II. and James II., it would appear that the Board\r\ncould not be sued before the Law Courts for the amount of their debts;—\r\nthe letter-books of that period teeming with piteous appeals from the\r\ndefrauded creditors.\r\n\r\nOne unhappy man writes that in consequence of the inability of the Board\r\nto meet his claims, he \"had undergone extreme hardships, even to\r\nimprisonment, loss of employment, and reputation.\" Another in the same\r\nyear, 1682, writes, that \"he is in a very necessitous and indigent\r\ncondition, having not wherewithal to supply his want and necessity; and\r\nhe doth in all humility tender his miserable condition to your Honours'\r\nconsideration.\"\r\n\r\nDuring periods of actual or expected disturbance in Ireland, stores for\r\nthat country were often accumulated in Chester, and on the Welsh coast,\r\nready for shipment; from which it may be inferred, that the arrangements\r\nin Ireland for their safe keeping were inadequate.\r\n\r\nThe formation of a battalion of Artillery on the Irish establishment was\r\nnot contemplated until the year 1755, when, on the requisition of the\r\nLord-Lieutenant, a party of twenty-four non-commissioned officers and\r\nmen of the Royal Artillery, under the command of a First Lieutenant,\r\nleft Woolwich for Dublin, for that purpose. This detachment, having\r\nreceived considerable augmentation and a special organization, was in\r\nthe following year styled \"The Artillery Company in Ireland,\" the\r\ncommissions of the officers being dated the 1st of April, 1756. The\r\ncompany consisted of a Major, a Captain, one First and one Second\r\nLieutenant, three Lieutenant-Fireworkers, five Sergeants, five\r\nCorporals, one hundred and six Bombardiers, thirty-four Gunners, one\r\nhundred and two Matrosses, and two Drummers. The large number of\r\nBombardiers suggests a special service, probably in the bomb-vessels,\r\nfor which this class was employed. Major Brownrigg, the commandant of\r\nthe corps, was replaced in 1758, by Major D. Chevenix, from the 11th\r\nDragoons. Two years later, the company was considerably increased, and\r\nwas styled the \"Regiment of Royal Irish Artillery.\" It had now a\r\nColonel-in-Chief, and another _en seconde_, a Lieutenant-Colonel\r\ncommandant, a Major, four Captains, four First and four Second\r\nLieutenants, and four Lieutenant-Fireworkers. The Masters-General of the\r\nIrish Ordnance were _ex officio_ Colonels-in-Chief of the Irish\r\nArtillery. The following is a list of those who held this appointment\r\nduring the existence of the corps: James, Marquis of Kildare, Richard,\r\nEarl of Shannon, Charles, Marquis of Drogheda, Henry, Earl of\r\nCarhampton, and the Hon. Thomas Pakenham.\r\n\r\nReductions were made in the Regiment at the conclusion of peace in 1763,\r\nand again in 1766; but they were chiefly confined to weeding the\r\nRegiment of undersized men. In 1774, the rank of Lieutenant-Fireworker\r\nwas abolished, three years later than the same change had been made in\r\nEngland. In 1778, the Regiment was augmented from four to six companies,\r\nthe total of the establishment being raised from 228 to 534; and from\r\nthat date the senior first lieutenant received the rank of Captain-\r\nLieutenant. A further addition of seventy-eight gunners raised the total\r\nto 612, and caused an increase in the number of officers, four Second\r\nLieutenants being added in 1782.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1783, an invalid company was added, consisting of a captain,\r\nfirst and second lieutenant, one sergeant, two corporals, one drummer,\r\nthree bombardiers, four gunners, and thirty-nine matrosses, and with a\r\nfew additions to the marching companies raised the establishment to 701.\r\nBut in three months, a most serious reduction can be traced, not in the\r\ncadres, nor among the higher commissioned ranks, but among the\r\nsubalterns, and the rank and file, and the total fell to 386.\r\n\r\nBy the monthly returns for October, 1783, we find that the title of\r\nmatross, although retained in the invalid company, was otherwise\r\nabolished; the private soldiers being now all designated gunners. From\r\n1783 to 1789, the establishment remained at 386; and in 1791, it was the\r\nsame. The returns for the intermediate year have been lost.\r\n\r\nIn 1793, recruiting on a large scale can be traced, and we find, that in\r\nOctober, 1794, by successive augmentations, the establishment had\r\nreached a total of no less than 2069 of all ranks, organized into one\r\ninvalid and twenty marching companies. By a King's letter, dated 20th\r\nMay, 1795, these were constituted into two Battalions, the company of\r\ninvalids remaining distinct. This gave an addition of thirteen Field and\r\nStaff Officers, and three Staff Sergeants, raising the total\r\nestablishment from 2069 to 2085. Each company consisted of 100 of all\r\nranks—except the invalid company, which remained at a total of fifty-\r\nthree, until 1st October, 1800, when it was raised to 100—and the\r\nstrength of the Regiment reached its maximum, 2132.\r\n\r\nThis establishment continued, until the 1st of March, 1801, when, in\r\nanticipation of the amalgamation with the Royal Artillery, eight\r\ncompanies, with a proportion of Field Officers, were reduced, followed\r\nnext month by a reduction of two more.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st April, 1801, the remaining ten marching companies, with Field\r\nand Staff Officers, were incorporated with the Royal Artillery, and\r\nnumbered as the 7th Battalion of that corps. By General Order of 17th\r\nSeptember, 1801, the invalid company was transferred to the battalion of\r\ninvalids on the British establishment.\r\n\r\nIt was a singular coincidence that the officer of the Royal Artillery,\r\nwho forty-six years before had left Woolwich to organize the first\r\ncompany of the Royal Irish Artillery, should, on the amalgamation, have\r\nbeen the Colonel commandant of the new Battalion. Lieutenant-General\r\nStraton had proceeded, in May, 1755, to Ireland, for the former purpose,\r\nand he rejoined the Royal Artillery on the 1st April, 1801, as Colonel\r\ncommandant of the 7th Battalion. He died in Dublin on the 16th May,\r\n1803, after a service of sixty-one years.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the amalgamation, six of the companies were stationed in\r\nIreland, and four in the West Indies. The Irish Artillery was not exempt\r\nfrom foreign service, and the conduct of the men abroad was as excellent\r\nas it always was during the times of even the greatest civil commotion.\r\nWhen, however, they left Ireland on service, their pay became a charge\r\non the English Office of Ordnance; and in the Returns from their own\r\nhead-quarters we find that any men who might be in England, pending\r\nembarkation, were shown as \"on foreign service.\"\r\n\r\nThe first employment of the Irish Artillery abroad was during the\r\nAmerican war. In March, 1777, seventy men embarked, under the command of\r\nan officer of the Royal Artillery, and did duty with that corps in a\r\nmanner which called forth the highest commendations from the officers\r\nunder whom they served. The Master-General of the Ordnance, Lord\r\nTownsend, in a letter to the officer commanding the Irish Artillery,\r\ndated 23rd of December, 1777, alludes to these men in the following\r\nterms: \"I am informed that none among the gallant troops behaved so\r\nnobly as the Irish Artillery, who are now exchanged, and are to return.\r\nI am sorry they have suffered so much, but it is the lot of brave men,\r\nwho, so situated, prefer glorious discharge of their duty to an\r\nunavailing desertion of it.\"\r\n\r\nThe conduct of the Irish Artillery, both in America and in the darkest\r\nperiod of their service, in the West Indies, contrasts so strongly with\r\nthat of the men enlisted in Ireland for the Royal Artillery at the same\r\ntime, that evidently the recruiting for the latter corps must have been\r\ngrossly mismanaged, or, what is more probable, the national corps\r\nobtained with ease the best men, while the refuse of the country was\r\nleft to the recruiting sergeants of the Royal Artillery. In the\r\ncorrespondence of General Pattison, who at one period of the American\r\nwar commanded the Royal Artillery on that continent, the language\r\nemployed in describing the recruits enlisted in Ireland, and sent to\r\njoin the 3rd and 4th Battalions in America, would be strong in any one,\r\nbut is doubly so, coming from an officer always most courteous in his\r\nlanguage, and by no means given to exaggeration.\r\n\r\nThree companies of the Irish Artillery embarked for the Continent in\r\n1794, and served in Flanders and the Netherlands, under the Duke of\r\nYork. But, as has already been hinted, the most severe foreign service\r\nundergone by the corps was in the West Indies. In 1793, three companies\r\nembarked for these islands, and took honourable part during the\r\nfollowing year, in the capture of Martinique, Guadaloupe, and St. Lucia,\r\nas well as in the more general operations.\r\n\r\nTheir strength, on embarkation, had been 15 Officers and 288 non-\r\ncommissioned officers and men. In less than two years, only forty-three\r\nof the men were alive, and of the officers, only four returned to\r\nEurope. It accordingly became necessary to reinforce the companies by\r\ndrafts from Ireland; and in addition to these, two other companies\r\nsailed in the winter of 1795; thus bringing the total strength serving\r\nin the West Indies to 500 of all ranks. In less than two years, a\r\nfurther reinforcement of 176 officers, non-commissioned officers, and\r\nmen, was found necessary to repair the ravages of the climate upon the\r\ntroops; and apparently further drafts in the following year were only\r\navoided, by transferring the head-quarters of one of the companies to\r\nthe home establishment, and absorbing the men in the others. Four of the\r\ncompanies were still in the West Indies, when the amalgamation took\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nCertain details connected with the organization of the Irish Artillery,\r\nimmediately prior to their incorporation with the Royal Artillery,\r\nremain to be mentioned. On the 19th September, 1798, Lord Carhampton,\r\nthen Master-General of the Irish Ordnance, notified to the officer\r\ncommanding the corps, that the formation of the Artillery in Ireland\r\ninto _Brigades_ had been decided upon; the Brigades to be distinguished\r\nas heavy and light. The establishment of a Heavy Brigade was to include\r\nfour medium 12-pounders, and two 5½-inch howitzers:—of a Light Brigade,\r\nfour light 6-pounder Battalion guns. The former was to be manned by\r\nforty-eight non-commissioned officers and men, the latter by thirty-\r\nseven—of the Regiment; while the guns and waggons were to be horsed and\r\ndriven by the Driver Corps. This improved organization superseded the\r\nsystem of Battalion guns; for while, in September, 1798, one hundred of\r\nthe Irish Artillery were returned as being attached to these, in\r\nNovember only thirty-seven were so employed; in the following January,\r\nonly four; and in March, 1799, all were finally withdrawn. The\r\nadditional gunners from the Militia, who had, at the date of the new\r\norganization, been 213 in number, were gradually reduced by its\r\noperation, and in the monthly return for September, 1799, they disappear\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nIt was at first proposed that the 12-pounders and the howitzers of the\r\nHeavy Brigades should be drawn by four horses, and the 6-pounders of the\r\nLight Brigades by three; but subsequently a 4½-inch howitzer having been\r\nadded to each Light Brigade, the number of horses to each gun was\r\napparently increased from three to four, and the total number of horses\r\nto each Heavy Brigade was seventy-three;—to each Light Brigade, fifty-\r\none. The \"two leading horses were ridden by Artillerymen, and the gun\r\nwas driven by a driver.\"[16] This arrangement applied also to the\r\nammunition waggons. The harness-maker, wheeler, and smith, each rode a\r\nspare horse with harness on.\r\n\r\nWhile the guns had four horses, the howitzers in Heavy Brigades had but\r\nthree, and in Light Brigades only a pair. The Driver Corps furnished to\r\neach Heavy Brigade 1 officer, 1 quartermaster, 3 non-commissioned\r\nofficers, and 26 privates; to each Light Brigade, 5 non-commissioned\r\nofficers and 14 privates. For the information of the general reader, it\r\nmay be stated that the Brigades of the Irish Artillery were analogous to\r\nthe present Field Batteries; the modern Brigade of Artillery meaning a\r\nnumber of Batteries linked together for administrative purposes.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1799, there were twenty-five Brigades in Ireland, and at\r\nthis point they remained until the amalgamation with the Royal\r\nArtillery. Although it is not probable that they were all horsed at that\r\ndate, there were no less than 1027 officers and men at the appointed\r\nstations of the Brigades, and in the language of an old document in the\r\nRoyal Artillery Record Office, \"the New Irish Field Artillery had not\r\nonly form, but consistency.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to these Brigades of Field Artillery, the Regiment was\r\ndivided into detachments—generally eight in number,—stationed in the\r\nchief harbours, garrisons, and forts, for service with heavy ordnance.\r\nThe invalid company was scattered over the country, many of the non-\r\ncommissioned officers and men being totally unfit for service. The\r\nRegiment was actively employed in the field during the Rebellion; \"and\r\nit must be recorded to the honour of the Royal Irish Regiment of\r\nArtillery, that though exposed to every machination of the disaffected,\r\nand to the strongest temptations, they preserved throughout an unsullied\r\ncharacter, and manifested on all occasions a true spirit of loyalty,\r\nzeal, and fidelity to His Majesty's service and Government.\"[17]\r\n\r\nThe dress of the Royal Irish Artillery was as follows:—Blue coat with\r\nscarlet facings, cuff and collar gold embroidered; yellow worsted lace\r\nbeing used for all beneath the rank of corporal; gold-laced cocked hat,\r\nblack leather cockade, white cloth breeches, with short gaiters and\r\nwhite stockings in summer, and long gaiters in winter. The non-\r\ncommissioned officers and men wore their hair powdered and clubbed. In\r\n1798 jackets were introduced according to the pattern adopted for the\r\nArmy; and the gold lace was removed from the cocked hats.\r\n\r\nAt the date of the amalgamation the Regiment was armed with cavalry\r\ncarbines,—the bayonet and pouch, containing from sixteen to eighteen\r\nrounds, being carried on the same belt. A cross belt was also worn to\r\nwhich the great-coat was suspended, resting on the left hip. At an\r\nearlier period, the Regiment had been armed with long Queen Anne's\r\nfusils, which were replaced, when worn out, by arms of various patterns,\r\nuntil at length the cavalry carbine was adopted.\r\n\r\nOne cannot but be struck—in studying the history of this national corps\r\nof Artillery—with the rapidity of its formation, and its attainment of\r\nhigh discipline and professional knowledge,—keeping pace in its career\r\nof half a century with the constant changes, with which even in those\r\ndays this arm was harassed; nor can one read without pride and interest\r\nthose pages of loyalty at home, gallantry on service abroad, and patient\r\nendurance under suffering and disease in the West Indies,—at once as\r\nfatal as active war, and yet destitute of the excitement which in war\r\nenables the soldier willingly to undergo any hardship.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 16:\r\n\r\n  MS in Royal Artillery Record Office.\r\n\r\nFootnote 17:\r\n\r\n  MS. in Royal Artillery Record Office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV.\r\n FIRST BATTALION.—THE HISTORY AND PRESENT DESIGNATION OF THE COMPANIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the beginning of the year 1757, the Regiment consisted of nineteen\r\ncompanies, with four field officers. On the 2nd April four additional\r\ncompanies were added, giving a total of twenty-four companies, inclusive\r\nof the Cadet Company.\r\n\r\nBut there was no organization in existence corresponding to the\r\nBattalion, or present Brigade, system. The number of company officers\r\nwas very great, being no less than 140 at the end of 1756; and as there\r\nwere only four field officers, the prospect of promotion to the younger\r\nmen was very disheartening. By introducing the Battalion system, and\r\ndividing the companies in some way which should give an excuse for an\r\naugmentation in the higher ranks, stagnation would be less immediate,\r\nand discontent among the junior ranks postponed. Charles, Duke of\r\nMarlborough, being then Master-General, approved of this change, and the\r\nRegiment was on the 1st August, 1757, divided into two Battalions, each\r\nhaving three field officers, and a separate staff. The strength of the\r\nRegiment, after this change had been introduced, was as follows:—\r\n\r\nNo. of Companies, 24:—\r\n\r\n            One Colonel-in-Chief, and one _en seconde_    2\r\n            Field Officers                                6\r\n            Captains and Captain-Lieutenants             48\r\n            Subaltern Officers                          117\r\n            Chaplain                                      1\r\n            Medical Officers                              3\r\n            Bridge-master                                 1\r\n            Adjutants                                     2\r\n            Quartermasters                                2\r\n            Gentlemen Cadets                             48\r\n            Non-commissioned Officers                   322\r\n            Gunners                                     460\r\n            Matrosses                                  1472\r\n            Drummers and Fifers                          47\r\n                                                       ————\r\n                              Total                    2531\r\n                                                       ————\r\n\r\nThe recruiting of Battalions was always carried on by means of parties\r\nscattered over England and Scotland, but the men so obtained were liable\r\nto be transferred to other Battalions, whose wants might be greater.\r\nThis system, which still obtains, prevents, and perhaps wisely, any\r\ngreat Battalion, or Brigade _esprit de corps_. The real _esprit_ should\r\nbe for the Regiment first, and then for the Battery. The organization,\r\nby whatever name it may be called, which links a certain number of\r\nBatteries together for special purposes, has never been allowed the\r\nofficial respect which is paid to the Battalion system in the Infantry.\r\nIn the absence of such respect, and in the knowledge that the men who\r\nmight receive their instruction in one Brigade or Battalion were liable\r\nto transfer to another, immediately on the completion of their drills,\r\nis to be found the reason why both in the days of Battalions and\r\nBrigades there has been no _esprit_ found strong enough to weaken that\r\nwhich should exist in every Artilleryman's mind for his Regiment at\r\nlarge, instead of for a detail of it. At the same time, the transfer\r\nsystem can be carried to an injurious extent. The instruction of\r\nrecruits is more likely to be thorough, if the instructor feels that he\r\nhimself is likely to retain under his command those whom he educates.\r\nThe consciousness that the \"_Sic vos non vobis_\" system is to be applied\r\nto himself must diminish to a certain extent his zeal in instruction.\r\nAnd therefore while no one should be allowed to imagine that his own\r\nBattery or his own Brigade is to be considered before the Regiment at\r\nlarge, there can be no doubt that the Depôt system for feeding the\r\nRegimental wants is far less cruel than that by which volunteers are\r\ncalled, or transfers ordered, from one portion of the Regiment to\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of the 1st Battalion varied very much with the signs\r\nof the times. Before the Peninsular War, its greatest strength was in\r\n1758, the year after its formation, when it consisted of 13 companies,\r\nand a total of 1383 of all ranks. In 1772, it fell to 8 companies, with\r\na total of 437; but during the American War of Independence, it reached\r\na total of 1259, divided into 11 companies. After the peace of 1783, it\r\nwas again reduced, falling to a total of 648, in ten companies. During\r\nthe Peninsular War, the average strength of the Battalion was 1420, the\r\nnumber of companies remaining the same; but as only one company of the\r\nBattalion served in the Peninsula, its increased numbers were evidently\r\nintended to assist in feeding the companies of other Battalions. After\r\nWaterloo it was greatly reduced, and for the next thirty years, its\r\naverage strength was 700, in 8 companies. In 1846, it rose to a total of\r\n842, and on the outbreak of the War with Russia, in which no fewer than\r\nfive companies of the Battalion were engaged, further augmentations took\r\nplace, the totals standing during the war as follows: in 1854, 1208; in\r\n1855, 1336; and in 1856, 1468.\r\n\r\nThe names of the various Captains who have successively commanded the\r\ncompanies of the 1st Battalion, down to the introduction of the Brigade\r\nsystem, and the new nomenclature in 1859, are given in the following\r\npages, as far as the state of the Battalion Records will admit. The list\r\nof the various military operations in which they were severally engaged\r\nis also given; and the names which the companies received at the\r\nreorganization referred to. It has been thought advisable to give this\r\nnow in a short but complete form, but in studying the various campaigns,\r\nthe services of the companies alluded to will occasionally receive more\r\ndetailed notice.\r\n\r\nIt is to be remembered that the history of these companies is the\r\nlegitimate property of the Batteries, which represent them. It is hoped\r\nthat the publication of their antecedents in this way will not merely\r\ninterest those in any way connected with them, but will create a feeling\r\nof pride which will materially aid discipline, and check negligence. It\r\nis believed that with such a past to appeal to as many of the Batteries\r\nwill find they have, a commander will find a weapon in dealing with his\r\nmen more powerful than the most penal code, for in each line there seems\r\nto be a voice speaking from the dead, and urging those who are, to be\r\nworthy of those who have been.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     No. 1 COMPANY, 1st BATTALION,\r\n                     Now \"F\" BATTERY, 9th BRIGADE.\r\n\r\n ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n Battles, Sieges, and other Military operations in which this Company\r\n   has been engaged.\r\n ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n 1796       Expedition to Saint Domingo.\r\n\r\n 1809       Expedition from Jamaica to Saint Domingo.\r\n\r\n 1854       Expedition to Crimea, and siege of Sebastopol.\r\n\r\n ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n List of Captains who have successively commanded the Company, as far\r\n   back as can be traced, down to introduction of Brigade System, in\r\n   1859.\r\n ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n 1757       Captain Robert Hind.\r\n              *       *       *       *       *\r\n 1779       Captain David Scott.\r\n 1788       Captain S.

The Cadet Company belonged to it, and\r\nwas one of the twelve which constituted the Battalion; but in 1758\r\nanother service company was added, making it, in respect of service\r\ncompanies, equal to the 1st Battalion.\r\n\r\nIts strength in 1758 amounted to a total of 1385, divided into thirteen\r\ncompanies. This strength was reduced in the following year by the\r\ntransfer of three companies to assist in the formation of the 3rd\r\nBattalion. One company was again added in 1761, and two taken away when\r\nthe 4th Battalion was formed in 1771. During the American War two\r\ncompanies were again added, and the greatest strength of all ranks was\r\n1145. In 1793 and 1794 it approached 1300; and during the Peninsular War\r\nits average strength was 1460. While the Crimean War lasted the\r\nBattalion consisted of eight companies, and its strength was as\r\nfollows:—In 1854, 1216; in 1855, 1344; and in 1856, 1480.\r\n\r\nThe distinctive mark of this Battalion was the fact, that the only\r\nArtillery present during the memorable siege of Gibraltar belonged to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe early services of the companies are difficult to trace. One company,\r\nunder Captain Hislop, was present at the defence of Fort St. George,\r\nMadras, when besieged by the French, in October, 1758. In November of\r\nthe same year a company of the Battalion, under Captain P. Innes,\r\nembarked with General Barrington's expedition, for the attack of the\r\nIsland of Martinique. This expedition was unsuccessful, but the troops\r\nwere then ordered against Guadaloupe, which was taken on 1st May, 1759.\r\nIn February, 1759, the siege of Fort St. George was raised by the\r\nFrench, Captain Hislop's Company receiving great praise for its conduct\r\nduring the defence.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     No. 1 COMPANY, 2nd BATTALION,\r\n                     Now \"7\" BATTERY, 21st BRIGADE.\r\n\r\n ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n Battles, Sieges, and other Military operations in which this Company\r\n   has been engaged.\r\n ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n 1779-1783  Siege of Gibraltar.\r\n 1801       Detachments in Egypt, present at Battle of Alexandria, and\r\n              later actions.\r\n 1809       Expedition to Walcheren.\r\n\r\n ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n List of Captains who have successively commanded the Company, as far\r\n   back as can be traced, down to introduction of Brigade System, in\r\n   1859.\r\n ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n              *       *       *       *       *\r\n 1782       Captain Joseph Eyre.\r\n 1782       Captain Charles Abbott.\r\n 1793       Captain James M.

If England must always look back with pride to the annals of\r\nthis war, so also must the Royal Artilleryman look back to this period\r\nof his Regimental History with amazement and satisfaction. It was a\r\nwonderful time,—a time bristling with ubiquitous victories,—a time\r\nteeming with chivalrous memories—Clive in the East, and Wolfe in the\r\nWest—British soldiers conquering under Prince Ferdinand at Minden, under\r\nLord Albemarle at the Havannah, under Amherst at Louisbourg, and under\r\nHodgson at Belleisle,—English Artillerymen winning honours and promotion\r\nfrom a foreign prince in Portugal; and at the end, when the Peace of\r\nParis allowed the nations to cast up the columns in their balance-sheet,\r\nEngland, finding Canada all her own, Minorca restored to her, and\r\nnineteen-twentieths of India acknowledging her sovereignty. It was a\r\ngolden time: who can paint it? Who can select enough of its episodes to\r\nsatisfy the reader, and yet not weary him with glut of triumph? And\r\nshall it be by continents that the deeds of our soldiers shall be\r\nwatched? or on account of popular leaders? or by value of results?\r\n\r\nWith much thought and hesitation it has been resolved in this work to\r\nchoose subjects for complex reasons. Who can think of England's Field\r\nArtillery without thinking, at such a time as this was, of Minden?—of\r\nher siege Artillery, without remembering Belleisle? And yet what would\r\nthe History of the Regiment at such a period in England's annals be, if\r\nthe names of Phillips, Macbean, and Desaguliers were unspoken?\r\n\r\nHappy coincidence that enables the historian to combine both,—that bids\r\nhim, as he writes of Minden, write also of Phillips, who was the head,\r\nand Macbean, who was the hand, of the corps on that proud day; and as he\r\ntells of the wet and miserable trenches at Belleisle, with the boom of\r\nits incessant bombardment, tell also of him, the brave, the learned\r\nDesaguliers, wounded, yet ever at his post! But is this all? The Seven\r\nYears' War, without America having a chapter given—America, which was\r\nthe cradle of the war, as it was the scene of its greatest triumphs!\r\nWhere shall we turn to choose on that continent some scene which shall\r\nbe noble and pleasant to tell, and shall not wander from the purpose of\r\nthis work? The mind clings instinctively to Wolfe, eager to narrate\r\nsomething of the Regiment's story over which his presence shall shed a\r\nlustre, in memory as in life. Quebec is eagerly studied, reluctantly\r\nlaid aside, for on that sad and glorious day only a handful of\r\nArtillerymen mustered on the Plains of Abraham. So the student wanders\r\nbackward from that closing scene, and on the shores of that bay in Cape\r\nBreton where Louisbourg once stood in arms, he finds a theme in which\r\nWolfe and this Regiment, whose history he fain would write, were joint\r\nand worthy actors. And what prouder comrade could one have than he who\r\nwas the Washington of England in bravery, in gentleness, in the\r\nadoration of his men?\r\n\r\nThese three episodes of the war, therefore, have been selected for\r\nseparate mention. In the present chapter the general outline of the war\r\nwill be glanced at, and domestic occurrences in the Regiment described.\r\n\r\nThe Seven Years' War owed its immediate origin to the quarrels in\r\nAmerica between England and France. Under the impression that the time\r\nwas favourable for recovering Silesia, which had been awarded to Prussia\r\nat the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, Austria secured Russia, Saxony, and\r\nSweden as allies, and ultimately France; while Prussia obtained the\r\nalliance of England. The commencement of the war was unfavourable to\r\nEngland. Minorca and Hanover fell into the hands of the French, and\r\nremained so until the end of the war. But they were avenged by the\r\nvictories of the British troops under Prince Ferdinand at Crevelt and\r\nMinden; and by the victories of the King of Prussia over the Austrians\r\nat Prague and Rosbach. The capture of Belleisle by the English\r\ncompensated, to a certain extent, for the loss of Minorca. The capture\r\nof Louisbourg, Quebec, Montreal, and ultimately the whole of Canada,\r\nadded lustre to the English arms in the West, as that of Pondicherry did\r\nin the East; while even Africa contributed its share to English triumph,\r\nin the capture of Senegal from the French.\r\n\r\nIt was not until 1758 that the first Artillery was sent to Germany. It\r\nwas increased in the following year, and a further reinforcement was\r\nsent in 1760, increasing the whole to five companies. Two companies were\r\nsent to America in 1757, to swell the Artillery force already there,\r\nwith a view to the reduction of Louisbourg and the subjugation of\r\nCanada. Two, besides a number of detachments, were at Belleisle in 1761;\r\nthe company at Gibraltar was increased by another; two companies were\r\nsent to Portugal after France had formed the Treaty known as the Family\r\nCompact; four were in the East Indies; two companies, besides a number\r\nof detachments, accompanied Lord Albemarle to the Havannah; and a\r\ndetachment went to Senegal. This summary—not including the numerous\r\ndetachments on board the bomb-vessels—is sufficient to give some idea of\r\nthe ubiquitous duties performed by the Regiment during this time.\r\n\r\nThe increase in the number of companies which took place during the\r\nSeven Years' War was accompanied by the formation of another Battalion\r\n(the Third), whose history will therefore, be given in proper\r\nchronological place.\r\n\r\nAlthough three episodes have been selected for more detailed mention\r\nthan the others, it would not be just to omit all notice of the other\r\nevents which occurred in the Regiment's history at this time. Turning to\r\nthe East, there are many pages in the old records which speak\r\neloquently, though quaintly, of service done at this time by the corps\r\nin India. A mixed force, under the command of Captain Richard Maitland,\r\nR.A., was ordered by the Governor of Bombay to proceed, in February,\r\n1759, against the City and Castle of Surat. Captain Maitland's and\r\nCaptain Northall's companies were present with the force, but the last-\r\nnamed officer died of sunstroke on the march. \"The first attack,\" writes\r\nCaptain Maitland, \"that we made was against the French garden, where the\r\nenemy (Seydees) had lodged a number of men. Them we drove out, after a\r\nvery smart firing on both sides for about four hours, our number lost\r\nconsisting of about twenty men killed and as many wounded. After we had\r\ngot possession of the French garden, I thought it necessary to order the\r\nEngineer to pitch upon a proper place to erect a battery, which he did,\r\nand completed it in two days. On the battery were mounted two 24-\r\npounders and a 13-inch mortar, which I ordered to fire against the wall,\r\n&c., as brisk as possible. After three days' bombarding from the\r\nbatteries and the armed vessels, I formed a general attack, driving the\r\nenemy from their batteries, and carrying the outer town, with its\r\nfortifications. The same evening I commenced firing from the 13 and 10-\r\ninch mortars on the inner town and castle, distant 500 and 700 yards.\r\nThe continual firing of our batteries caused such consternation, and the\r\nimpossibility of supporting themselves caused the Governor to open the\r\ngates of the town, and offering to give up the castle if I would allow\r\nhim and his people to march out with their effects. We got possession\r\nwithout further molestation.\" Captain Maitland, who seems to have been\r\nmore proficient with his sword than his pen, died in India in 1763.\r\n\r\nThe scene changes to Manilla; and on a faded page the student reads how\r\na company of Artillery arrived off that island on the 23rd September,\r\n1762, with General Draper's force, and made good their landing next\r\nmorning with three field-guns and one howitzer. By the 26th the\r\nbatteries were ready for heavier ordnance; and eight 24-pounders were\r\nplaced in one, and 10 and 13-inch mortars in another. And here the dim\r\npage is illumined by a sentence dear to the student's heart:—\"The\r\nofficers of Artillery and Engineers exercising themselves in a manner\r\nthat nothing but their zeal for the public service could have inspired.\"\r\nOn the 5th October, so violent had been the fire of the Artillery, that\r\nthe breach appeared practicable; and at daylight on the morning of the\r\n6th, after a general discharge from all the batteries, the troops rushed\r\nto the assault. The Governor and principal officers retired to the\r\ncitadel, and surrendered themselves prisoners at discretion.\r\n\r\nAgain the scene changes. On the 5th March, 1762, Lord Albemarle's\r\nexpedition left Portsmouth for the Havannah. The Royal Artillery\r\nconsisted of Captain Buchanan's and Captain Anderson's companies, with\r\nBrevet-Lieutenant-Colonels Leith[20] and Cleveland, Captain-Lieutenant\r\nWilliamson as a Volunteer, and Lieutenants Lee, Lemoine, and Blomefield\r\nfor duty on board the bomb-vessels. On reaching Barbadoes news is\r\nreceived of the capitulation of Martinique to General Monckton's force,\r\nand the fleet steers for that island. Here large reinforcements from\r\nAmerica meet them, including Captain Strachey's company, which brings\r\nthe strength of the Artillery up to 377 of all ranks. On the 6th June\r\nthe expedition reaches Havannah, and a landing is effected six miles to\r\nthe eastward of the Moro, which it is resolved to besiege first. And\r\nhere the story becomes a purely Artillery matter. Two batteries were\r\nopened—one against the Moro, at 192 yards distance, called the grand\r\nbattery, and one for howitzers, to annoy the shipping. Repeated and\r\nunsuccessful sallies were made by the enemy; and still battery after\r\nbattery was made and opened by the English. On the 1st July four\r\nbatteries opened fire—from twelve 24-pounders, six 13-inch, three 10-\r\ninch, and 26 Royal mortars. On the 3rd July another was completed; and\r\non the 16th sixteen additional guns were brought into play and so well\r\nserved that the besieged were reduced to six guns. But there were other\r\nenemies than man to contend with. Twice the Grand Battery took fire, and\r\nthe second time it was entirely consumed. Fresh provisions became\r\nscarce, and water equally so. No words can paint what followed better\r\nthan the short sentence which meets the student's eye:—\"The scanty\r\nsupply of water exhausted their strength, and, joined to the anguish of\r\ndreadful thirst, put an end to the existence of many. Five thousand\r\nsoldiers and three thousand sailors were laid up with various\r\ndistempers.\"[21] On the 22nd,—a lodgment having been effected on the\r\nglacis,—it was found necessary to have recourse to mining; and on the\r\n30th the mines were sprung and the place carried by storm. Fresh\r\nbatteries were now formed, and the guns of the Moro turned against the\r\ntown. On the 11th August forty-five guns and eight mortars opened on the\r\ntown with such fury, that flags of truce were soon hung up all round the\r\ntown, and on the following day the articles of capitulation were signed;\r\nthe principal gates of the town were taken possession of; the English\r\ncolours were hoisted; and Captain Duncan took possession of the men-of-\r\nwar in the harbour.[22]\r\n\r\nThe death vacancies in the Artillery, which were very numerous, had been\r\nfilled up on the spot by Lord Albemarle, who not merely gave the\r\npromotions, but also made first appointments as Lieutenant-Fireworkers\r\nfrom among the cadets and non-commissioned officers present with the\r\ncompanies. The whole of these promotions were ratified by the Board in\r\nthe following year; but an opportunity was taken at the same time of\r\ninforming the Regiment that \"Lieutenant-Colonel Cleveland's brevet is\r\nnot to allow of his ranking otherwise than as Major in the Regiment,\"\r\nalthough his pay would be that of the higher rank.\r\n\r\nYet again and again, from east to west and west to east, do the scenes\r\nin the Regimental drama at this time change. From Newfoundland we hear\r\nof a gallant band of fifty-eight Artillerymen under Captain Ferguson,\r\nwith a train of no less than twenty-nine pieces, being present with\r\nColonel Amherst at the recapture of that island, after its brief\r\noccupation by the French. And from Portugal comes a letter from Lord\r\nLondon in October, 1762: \"In the action of Villa Vella, Major Macbean,\r\nwith four field-pieces, joined, having used the greatest diligence in\r\nhis march. The force retiring, Major Macbean's guns formed part of the\r\nrear-guard, which he conducted so effectually, that hardly any shot was\r\nfired that did not take place among the enemy.... Major Macbean of the\r\nArtillery is an officer whose zeal and ability, upon this and every\r\nother occasion, justly entitle him to the warmest recommendations I can\r\npossibly give him.\"\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, what was going on in England?\r\n\r\nAn unsuccessful expedition was ordered in July, 1757, to Rochfort, in\r\nwhich Captain James's company was engaged. On its return in October the\r\nCompany was sent to Scarborough.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th June, 1758, we find 400 Artillerymen with sixty guns forming\r\npart of an expedition against St. Malo under Charles, Duke of\r\nMarlborough; but little was done except destroying a large number of\r\nFrench vessels. The subsequent attack and capture of Cherbourg was more\r\nsuccessful, and the number of guns taken from the enemy enabled the\r\nGovernment to get up a display in London—utterly out of proportion to\r\nthe actual danger and loss incurred by the troops, but intended to\r\ngratify the populace—which may be described in a few words. \"The cannon\r\nand mortars taken at Cherbourg passed by His Majesty, set out from Hyde\r\nPark and came through the City in grand procession, guarded by a company\r\nof matrosses, with drums beating and fifes playing all the way to the\r\nTower, where they arrived at four o'clock in the afternoon. There were\r\ntwenty-three carriages drawn by 229 horses, with a postilion and driver\r\nto each carriage in the following manner:—The first, drawn by fifteen\r\ngrey horses, with the English colours and the French underneath; seven\r\nditto, drawn by thirteen horses each; nine ditto by nine horses each;\r\nthree ditto by seven horses each; one ditto by five horses; then the two\r\nmortars, by nine horses each.\"\r\n\r\nAnd at Woolwich, what was going on? Promotion was brisk, with death so\r\nbusy all over the world; officers got their commissions when very young;\r\nand the age of the cadets fell in proportion. Hence we feel no surprise\r\nthat the legislation for these young gentlemen occupies a considerable\r\npart of the order-books of the period. But the remaining orders are not\r\ndestitute of interest. One, dated 1st October, 1758, introduces a name\r\nwhich has been familiar to the Regiment ever since in the same capacity:\r\n\"R. Cox, Esq., is appointed Paymaster to the Royal Regiment of\r\nArtillery.\" The division of the Regiment into Battalions rendered many\r\norders necessary. It was now for the first time laid down that the\r\nquartermasters were responsible for the clothing and equipment until\r\nhanded over to the captains. A separate roster was kept for detachments,\r\nwhich, however, was not to interfere with officers accompanying their\r\nown men, when the whole company moved. Promotion from matross to gunner\r\nwas ordered never to be made without submitting the case to the\r\nLieutenant-General of the Ordnance, in the same manner as the promotion\r\nof non-commissioned officers. No non-commissioned officer was to be\r\nrecommended for promotion who had not written in full for the\r\nexamination of his Captain the names and different parts of guns and\r\nmortars, their carriages and beds, and also a full description of a gyn.\r\nAnd at every parade the Captain of the week was to take care that the\r\nmen were made acquainted with the names of all the different parts of a\r\ngun and carriage, and of a gyn, and once a day to mount and dismount a\r\ngun. Every man was supplied with three rounds of ball-cartridge, without\r\nwhich he was never to go on duty; when discharged, an English gunner\r\nreceived a fortnight's pay; a Scotchman received a month's, provided he\r\nhad been enlisted in Scotland; no Irishman was on any account allowed at\r\nthis time to be enlisted for the Royal Artillery; no recruit was\r\npermitted leave of absence until he had been dismissed drill; no man on\r\nguard was to \"extort money from any prisoner on any pretence\r\nwhatsoever;\" no man was to pull off his clothes or accoutrements during\r\nthe hours of exercise; no pay-sergeant was allowed to pay the men in a\r\npublic-house; the drummers and fifers were, when on duty, always to wear\r\ntheir swords; any pay-sergeant lending money _at a premium_ to any of\r\nthe men was to be tried and reduced to the rank of matross, and any man\r\nconsenting to be imposed upon in this respect would receive no further\r\nadvancement in the Regiment. No men were allowed to enter the Laboratory\r\nin their new clothing. Every recruit for the Regiment at this time\r\nreceived a guinea and a crown as bounty, provided he were medically fit,\r\n5 feet 9 inches in height, and not over 25 years of age.\r\n\r\nMany of the orders would lose their quaintness, if curtailed.\r\n\r\nNovember 19, 1758. \"Complaint having been made of the Greenwich guard\r\nfor milking the cows belonging to Combe Farm, the Sergeant of that guard\r\nto be answerable for such theft, who will be broke and punished if he\r\nsuffer it for the future, and does not take care to prevent it.\"\r\n\r\nJan. 6, 1759. \"The Paymasters of each company are to clear with the\r\nnurse of the hospital once a week. No man is to be allowed within the\r\nnurse's apartment.\"\r\n\r\nMarch 19, 1759. \"The sentries to load with a running ball, and when the\r\nOfficer of the Guard goes his rounds, they are to drop the muzzles of\r\ntheir pieces to show him that they are properly loaded.\"\r\n\r\nJune 14, 1758. \"In drilling with the Battalion guns the man who loads\r\nthe gun is to give the word 'Fire,' as it is natural to believe he will\r\nnot do it till he believes himself safe; and he who gives the word\r\n'Fire' is not to attempt to sponge until he hears the report of the\r\ngun.\"\r\n\r\nWith regard to officers, the order-books at this time divided their\r\nattention pretty equally between the Surgeon and his mate, who had a\r\nplayful habit of being out of the way when wanted, and that favourite\r\ntheme, the young officers. Much fatherly advice, which in more modern\r\ntimes would be given verbally, was given then through the channel of the\r\nRegimental order-book. Nor was the system more successful, if one may\r\njudge from the frequent repetitions of neglected orders. Various orders\r\nas to dress were given, from which we learn that boots for the officers\r\nand black spatterdashes for the men were the ordinary covering for their\r\nextremities on parade—white spatterdashes with their six-and-thirty\r\nbuttons being reserved for grand occasions. It was a very serious crime\r\nto wear a black stock,—white being the orthodox colour—and the lace from\r\nthe officers' scarlet waistcoats was removed at this period. Very great\r\nattention was paid at this time to perfecting the officers, old and\r\nyoung, in the knowledge of laboratory duties, nor was any exemption\r\nallowed. From the order-books of this date, also, we learn that\r\nofficers' servants were chosen from among the matrosses; and that, on a\r\nman becoming a gunner, he ceased to be a servant. Nor was a matross\r\nallowed to be made gunner until a recruit was found to fill his vacancy\r\nin the lower grade. As now, the practice prevailed then, whenever a man\r\nin debt was transferred from one company to another, of making the\r\nCaptain who received the man reimburse the Captain who handed him over,\r\nrepaying himself by stoppages from the man's pay.\r\n\r\nWith this general glance at the Regiment during the Seven Years' War,\r\nthe History will now proceed to a somewhat fuller examination of the\r\nthree important episodes in that War, which have been selected.\r\n\r\n  _N.B._—Good service was rendered at Guadaloupe in 1759 by a Company\r\n  under Major S. Cleaveland, and at Martinique in 1762 by two\r\n  Companies under Lieutenant-Colonel Ord.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 20:\r\n\r\n  Lieutenant-Colonel Leith was killed subsequently at the bombardment of\r\n  Havannah, while in command of the Artillery.\r\n\r\nFootnote 21:\r\n\r\n  Cleaveland's MSS.\r\n\r\nFootnote 22:\r\n\r\n  Afterwards Lord Camperdown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII.\r\n                        THE SIEGE OF LOUISBOURG.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE year in which the Regiment was divided into two Battalions witnessed\r\nthe commencement in America of military operations which were to result\r\nin the complete removal of French authority from Canada.\r\n\r\nCaptain Ord's company, which had suffered so grievously at Fort du\r\nQuesne in 1755, having been reinforced from England, was joined in 1757\r\nby two companies under Colonel George Williamson, and a large staff of\r\nartificers, the whole being intended to form part of an expedition\r\nagainst the French town of Louisbourg in Cape Breton, now part of the\r\nprovince of Nova Scotia. It was to be Colonel Williamson's good fortune\r\nto command the Royal Artillery in America until, in 1760, the English\r\npower was fully established on the Continent.\r\n\r\nWhen the English captured Annapolis and Placentia in the beginning of\r\nthe 18th century, the French garrisons were allowed to settle in\r\nLouisbourg, which place they very strongly fortified. Its military\r\nadvantages were not very great, had an attack from the land side been\r\nundertaken, for it was surrounded by high ground; but it had an\r\nadmirable harbour, and it was very difficult to land troops against the\r\nplace from the sea side of the town. The harbour lies open to the south-\r\neast, and is nearly six miles long, with an average depth of seven\r\nfathoms, and an excellent anchorage. There was abundance of fuel in the\r\nneighbourhood, both wood and coal; in fact, the whole island was full of\r\nboth; and there were casemates in the town which could greatly shelter\r\nthe women and children during a bombardment. Generally some French men-\r\nof-war were in the harbour; and in 1757, when the siege was first\r\nproposed to be undertaken, so strong was the French fleet at Louisbourg,\r\nthat the English commanders postponed their operations until the\r\nfollowing year. Had our statesmen been better acquainted with geography,\r\nit is probable that at the Peace of Utrecht, when Nova Scotia and\r\nNewfoundland were authoritatively pronounced to be English territory,\r\nCape Breton would have also been included; but being an island, and\r\nseparate from Nova Scotia although immediately adjoining it, the French\r\ndid not consider that it fell within the treaty, and clung to it, as\r\nthey always had to the maritime provinces of Canada.\r\n\r\nThe siege of 1758 was not the first to which Louisbourg had been\r\nsubjected. In 1745 an expedition had been fitted out from Massachusetts—\r\nthe land forces being American Militia under Colonel Pepperell, and the\r\nnaval contingent being composed of English men-of-war under Commodore\r\nWarren. The amicable relations between the naval and military commanders\r\ntended greatly to bring about the ultimate success.\r\n\r\nThe American Militia were badly trained, and far from well disciplined,\r\nbut they were brave, headstrong, and animated by strong hatred of their\r\nold enemies the French. Powerful as Louisbourg was (it was called the\r\nDunkirk of America) the Americans did not hesitate to attack it, and\r\nthey were justified by the result. On the 30th April, 1745, the siege\r\ncommenced; on the 15th June, M. Du Chambon, the Governor of Louisbourg,\r\nsigned the capitulation.\r\n\r\nFor a year after this, the town was occupied by the American Militia;\r\nbut a garrison which included a company of the Royal Artillery was then\r\nsent from England, and remained until 1748, when by the treaty of Aix-\r\nla-Chapelle Louisbourg was restored to the French. The sum of\r\n235,749_l._ was paid by England to her American colonies, to meet the\r\nexpenses of the expedition whose success had now been cancelled by\r\ndiplomacy, and if to this sum be added the expenses of the Navy, and the\r\ncost of garrisoning the place for three years, we shall find that at\r\nleast 600,000_l._ must have been expended to no purpose.\r\n\r\nTime went on; treaties were torn up; and Louisbourg was again the object\r\nof English attack. It is this second siege which is the one considered\r\nin this chapter; for none of the Royal Artillery were present at the\r\nfirst; the Artillery which fought on that occasion being militia,\r\ncommanded by an officer who fought against England during the subsequent\r\nWar of Independence. An indirect interest certainly is attached to that\r\nsiege in the mind of one studying the annals of the Royal Artillery; for\r\nhad it been unsuccessful, Annapolis with its little garrison would have\r\nbeen exposed to another assault. From private letters in possession of\r\nthe descendants of a distinguished Artillery officer—Major-General\r\nPhillips—the perilous condition of that town during 1745 can be easily\r\nrealized. Large bodies of French, and of hostile Indians, were in the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood, making no secret of their intention to attack\r\nAnnapolis in force, should the English siege of Louisbourg be\r\nunsuccessful. With the news of its capture, the danger to Annapolis\r\ndisappeared. These local wars between the French and English settlers\r\nproved an admirable school for instructing the New Englanders in\r\nmilitary operations; nor was it foreseen that the experience thus\r\nacquired would be turned against the parent country. Distraction in\r\nAmerica helped England in her wars with France in Europe; and such\r\ndistractions were easy to raise among colonists whose mutual hatred was\r\nso great. It was never imagined that the tools which England thus used\r\nagainst France were being sharpened in the process for use against\r\nherself in the stern days which were coming on. Colonial rebellion\r\nseemed impossible; colonial endurance was believed to be eternal; it was\r\nhoped that patriotism and sentiment would be stronger than any hardship,\r\nand would condone any injustice. But when the day came when colonists\r\nasked the question \"Why?\" for the Imperial actions towards them, the\r\nparental tie was cut, and the lesson taught in the school of local\r\nwarfare—the lesson of their own strength—became apparent to the\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nThe siege of Louisbourg, in 1758, has a threefold interest to the\r\nmilitary reader; in connection with the conspicuous services of the\r\nRoyal Artillery on the occasion; in relation to the story of the gallant\r\nWolfe, who acted as one of the Brigadiers; and in the fact that this was\r\nthe last place held by the French against England, on the east coast of\r\nAmerica. Ghastly for France as the results of the Seven Years' War were,\r\nperhaps none were felt more acutely than this loss of Canada, with its\r\nepisodes of Louisbourg and Quebec. Louis the Well-beloved was sinking\r\ninto a decrepit debauchee; and in the East and in the West his kingdom\r\nwas crumbling away. The distinctive characteristics, even at this day,\r\nof the French population of Canada, which have survived more than a\r\ncentury of English rule, give an idea of the firm hold France had\r\nobtained on the country; and the strength of that hold must have made\r\nthe pang of defeat proportionately bitter.\r\n\r\nLord Loudon was to have commanded the expedition; and in 1757 the\r\nnecessary troops and ships were concentrated at Halifax, now the capital\r\nof Nova Scotia. But on learning that there were 10,300 of a garrison in\r\nLouisbourg, besides fifteen men-of-war and three frigates, he abandoned\r\nthe idea of an attack, and sailed for New York, leaving garrisons in\r\nHalifax and Annapolis.\r\n\r\nIn the following year, the idea was revived; and General Amherst left\r\nHalifax for Louisbourg with a force of 12,260 men, of whom 324 belonged\r\nto the Royal Artillery. The naval force consisted of 23 ships of the\r\nline and 18 frigates; and the number of vessels employed as transports\r\nwas 144.\r\n\r\nThe Artillery train included 2 Captain-Lieutenants, 6 First Lieutenants,\r\n5 Second Lieutenants, and 4 Lieutenant-Fireworkers; besides a staff\r\nconsisting of a Colonel, an Adjutant, a Quartermaster, and two medical\r\nofficers. There were no less than 53 non-commissioned officers, to a\r\ntotal rank and file of 63 gunners and 163 matrosses.\r\n\r\nThe Regiments engaged were as follows:—the 1st Royals, 15th, 17th, 22nd,\r\n28th, 35th, 40th, 45th, 47th, 48th, 58th, two battalions of the 60th\r\nRoyal Americans, and Frazer's Highlanders. There were eleven officers of\r\nminers and engineers, and they were assisted during the siege, and at\r\nthe demolition of the fortifications, by selected officers from the\r\nInfantry Regiments. General Amherst was assisted by the following\r\nBrigadiers:—Whitmore, Lawrance, and James Wolfe.\r\n\r\nThe following guns were taken with the Artillery:—\r\n\r\n                                Brass.\r\n\r\n                      26 24-prs. guns.\r\n                      18 12-prs. guns.\r\n                       6 6-prs. guns.\r\n                       1 3-pr. gun (sent by mistake).\r\n                       2 13-inch mortars.\r\n                       2 10-inch mortars.\r\n                       7 8-inch mortars.\r\n                      10 5½-inch mortars.\r\n                      30 4⅖-inch mortars.\r\n\r\n                                 Iron.\r\n\r\n                       8 32-prs. guns.\r\n                      25 24-prs. guns.\r\n                       4 6-prs. guns.\r\n                       1 13-inch mortar.\r\n\r\nThere were also two 8-inch and four 5½-inch howitzers. Over 43,000 round\r\nshot, 2380 case, 41,762 shell, besides a few grape and carcasses, and\r\n4888 barrels of powder accompanied the train.\r\n\r\nThe fleet was commanded by Admiral Boscawen, assisted by Vice-Admiral\r\nSir Charles Hardy, and Commodore Durell. It consisted, as has been said,\r\nof no less than 23 ships of the line, and 18 frigates. Even the harbour\r\nof Halifax, Nova Scotia, which has been the witness of so many\r\nhistorical scenes, never saw a finer sight than when on Sunday the 28th\r\nMay, 1758, this fleet, accompanied by the transports, sailed for\r\nLouisbourg. All the arrangements for the embarkation and the siege had\r\nbeen made by Brigadier Lawrance, at Halifax, even down to such details\r\nas the prescription of ginger and sugar for the troops, for the purpose\r\nof neutralizing the evil effects of the American water—an evil which\r\nmust certainly have existed in the Brigadier's imagination. But just as\r\nthey left the harbour, and reached Sambro' Point, they met a vessel from\r\nEngland with General Amherst on board, commissioned to take command of\r\nthe expedition, as far as the military forces were concerned. The\r\ncordial relations between him and Admiral Boscawen assisted, to a marked\r\nextent, in bringing about the success of the enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe orders issued to the troops were intended to excite them to anger\r\nagainst the enemy, at the same time that they should inculcate the\r\nstrongest discipline. The quaintness of some of them renders them worthy\r\nof reproduction. \"No care or attention will be wanting for the\r\nsubsistence and preservation of the troops, such as our situation will\r\nadmit of. There will be an Hospital, and in time it is hoped there will\r\nbe fresh meat for the sick and wounded men.... The least murmur or\r\ncomplaint against any part of duty will be checked with great severity,\r\nand any backwardness in sight of the enemy will be punished with\r\nimmediate death. If any man is villain enough to desert his colours and\r\ngo over to the enemy, he shall be excepted in the capitulation, and\r\nhanged with infamy as a traitor. When any of our troops are to attack\r\nthe French regular forces, they are to march close up to them, discharge\r\ntheir pieces loaded with two bullets, and then rush upon them with their\r\nbayonets; and the commander of the Highlanders may, when he sees\r\noccasion, order his corps to run upon them with their drawn swords.... A\r\nbody of light troops are now training to oppose the Indians, Canadians,\r\nand other painted savages of the Island, who will entertain them in\r\ntheir own way, and preserve the women and children of the Army from\r\ntheir unnatural barbarity. Indians spurred on by our inveterate enemy,\r\nthe French, are the only brutes and cowards in the creation who were\r\never known to exercise their cruelties upon the sex, and to scalp and\r\nmangle the poor sick soldiers and defenceless women. When the light\r\ntroops have by practice and experience acquired as much caution and\r\ncircumspection, as they have spirit and activity, these howling\r\nbarbarians will fly before them.... The tents will be slightly\r\nintrenched or palisaded, that the sentries may not be exposed to the\r\nshot of a miserable-looking Mic-Mac, whose trade is not war, but\r\nmurder.... As the air of Cape Breton is moist and foggy, there must be a\r\nparticular attention to the fire-arms upon duty, that they may be kept\r\ndry, and always fit for use; and the Light Infantry should fall upon\r\nsome method to secure their arms from the dews, and dropping of the\r\ntrees when they are in search of the enemy.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a favourable passage, the fleet anchored in Gabreuse Bay, on\r\nFriday the 2nd June. This bay is about three leagues by sea from\r\nLouisbourg harbour, and to the southwest of it. Here it was resolved to\r\nattempt a landing; but for days the elements fought for the French.\r\nIncessant fogs and a tremendous surf rendered the enterprise hopeless,\r\nuntil Thursday, the 8th June. The landing was ultimately effected under\r\nthe fire of the ships; the leading boats containing the four senior\r\ncompanies of grenadiers, and all the light infantry of the force, under\r\nGeneral Wolfe, whose courage and skill on this occasion were\r\nconspicuous. With a loss of 111 killed and wounded, they succeeded in\r\ndriving the enemy back, and the other regiments were able to land. A\r\nchange of weather prevented the landing of Artillery, baggage, and\r\nstores, so that the troops were exposed for the night to great\r\ndiscomfort. The spirit of the men under Wolfe on this occasion was\r\nremarkable. Boats were swamped, or dashed to pieces on the rocks; many\r\nmen were drowned; and all had to leap into the water up to the waist;\r\nbut nothing could restrain their ardour. Not merely did they drive the\r\nenemy back, but they captured 4 officers and 70 men, and 24 pieces of\r\nOrdnance.\r\n\r\nFrom this day until the 19th, when the Royal Artillery opened upon the\r\ntown from a line of batteries which had been thrown up along the shore,\r\nthe operations of the army were weary and monotonous in the extreme.\r\nWith the exception of Wolfe's party, which was detached to secure a\r\nbattery called the Lighthouse Battery,—an undertaking in which he\r\nsucceeded, the duties of the troops consisted in making roads, and\r\ntransporting from the landing-place guns, ammunition, and stores. In all\r\nthe arrangements for the investment and bombardment, Colonel Williamson\r\nwas warmly supported by General Amherst; and the Admiral lent his\r\nassistance by landing his marines to work with the Artillery, and by\r\nsending four 32-pounders with part of his own ship's company, for a\r\nbattery whose construction had been strongly recommended. It was nearly\r\nten o'clock on the night of the 19th, when the English batteries opened\r\non the shipping and on the Island Battery. This last was a powerful\r\nbattery commanding the entrance to the harbour, and with a double ditch\r\nto the land side to strengthen it. It was the chief obstacle to the\r\nEnglish movements, and smart as our fire was, it returned it with equal\r\nwarmth. A battery of six 24-pounders was thrown up at the lighthouse for\r\nthe sole purpose of attempting to silence this particular battery; and\r\non the 25th it succeeded. The fire on the rest of the fortifications of\r\nLouisbourg was marvellously true, and incessant; and as of late years\r\nthey had been somewhat neglected, and in many places sea-sand had been\r\nused with the mortar in their construction, the effect of the English\r\nfire was more rapidly apparent.\r\n\r\nOne precaution had been taken on this occasion by the French, which had\r\nbeen omitted by them in 1745, as they had too good reason to remember.\r\nWhen compelled to evacuate the Grand Battery, they set fire to it, and\r\nrendered it utterly useless; so that the course pursued by the English\r\nin the former siege, when they turned the guns of the battery against\r\nthe town, could not be repeated. The effects of the English fire in the\r\nsiege of 1758, when the Royal Artillery was represented, were thus\r\ndescribed by a French officer who was in the town:—\"Each cannon shot\r\nfrom the English batteries shook and brought down immense pieces of the\r\nruinous walls, so that, in a short cannonade, the Bastion du Roi, the\r\nBastion Dauphin, and the courtin of communication between them, were\r\nentirely demolished, all the defences ruined, all the cannon dismounted,\r\nall the parapets and banquettes razed, and became as one continued\r\nbreach to make an assault everywhere.\"[23]\r\n\r\nAn attempt was made by the Governor of Louisbourg to procure a cessation\r\nof fire against a particular part of the works, behind which he said was\r\nthe hospital for the sick and wounded. As however, there were shrewd\r\nreasons for believing that not the hospital, but the magazine, was the\r\nsubject of his anxious thoughts, his request was refused, but he was\r\ninformed that he might place his sick on board ship, where they would be\r\nunmolested, or on the island under our sentries. These offers, however,\r\nwere not accepted.\r\n\r\nThe fire of the enemy's Artillery slackened perceptibly about the 13th\r\nJuly, and continued getting feebler, so that in a fortnight's time an\r\noccasional shot was all that was fired. At the commencement of the siege\r\nthere were in Louisbourg 218 pieces of ordnance, exclusive of 11\r\nmortars; but such was the effect of the English fire, not merely in\r\ndismounting and disabling the guns, but (as the deserters reported) in\r\nkilling and wounding the gunners, that some days before the 27th July,\r\nwhen the capitulation was signed, the French reply to our Artillery fire\r\nwas simply _nil_. The gallantry of the French commandant, the Chevalier\r\nde Drucour, was undoubted; but he was sorely tried by the fears and\r\nprayers of the unhappy civil population, to whom military glory was a\r\nmyth, but a bombardment a very painful reality. Madame de Drucour did\r\nall in her power to inspire the troops with increased ardour; while\r\nthere were any guns in position to fire, she daily fired three herself;\r\nand showed a courage which earned for her the respect both of friend and\r\nenemy. But misfortunes came fast upon one another. A shot from the\r\nEnglish batteries striking an iron bolt in the powder magazine of the\r\nFrench ship 'Entreprenant,' an explosion followed, which set fire to\r\nher, and to two others alongside, the 'Capricieuse' and 'Superbe.' The\r\nconfusion which ensued baffles description; and not the least startling\r\noccurrence was the self-discharge of the heated guns in the burning\r\nships, whose shot went into the town, and occasionally into the other\r\ntwo men-of-war which had escaped a similar fate to that which befell the\r\nthree which have been named. Four days later, on the 25th July, a party\r\nof 600 British sailors entered the harbour, boarded the only two ships\r\nwhich remained, the 'Prudent' and 'Bienfaisant,' set fire to the former,\r\nwhich had gone aground, and towed the latter out of the harbour to the\r\nEnglish fleet.\r\n\r\nTheir batteries being destroyed, the fortifications one vast breach,\r\ntheir ships of war burnt or captured, and there being no prospect of\r\nrelief, the French commander had no alternative but capitulation. He\r\nfirst proposed to treat, but was informed in reply, that unless he\r\ncapitulated in an hour the English fleet would enter the harbour and\r\nbombard the town. So, after a little delay, he consented, on condition\r\nthat the French troops should be sent as prisoners of war to France.\r\n\r\nThe articles of capitulation were signed on the 27th July, 1758, and\r\nimmediately three companies of grenadiers took possession of the West\r\nGate, while General Whitmore superintended the disarming of the\r\ngarrison.\r\n\r\nThe expenditure of ammunition by the Royal Artillery during the siege\r\nwas as follows:—13,700 round shot, 3340 shell, 766 case shot, 156 round\r\nshot fixed, 50 carcasses, and 1493 barrels of powder. Eight brass, and\r\nfive iron guns were disabled; and one mortar.\r\n\r\nOf the English army, 524 were killed or wounded; and at the capture of\r\nthe place, there were 10,813 left fit for duty. The total strength of\r\nthe French garrison, including sailors and marines on shore, at the same\r\ndate, was 5637 of all ranks, of whom 1790 were sick or wounded.\r\n\r\nAfter the capitulation many of the English men-of-war moved into the\r\nharbour; and the demolition of the fortifications by the Engineers and\r\nworking-parties was methodically commenced. The approach of the winter,\r\nand the heavy garrison duties, suspended the work for a time; and it was\r\nnot until the 1st June, 1760, that the uninterrupted destruction of the\r\nworks was commenced, under Captain Muckell of the Company of Miners,\r\nassisted by working parties from the infantry, of strength varying\r\naccording to the work, from 160 to 220 daily. The miners and artificers\r\nnumbered a little over 100. The whole work was completed on the 10th\r\nNovember, 1760, there having been only two days' intermission, besides\r\nSundays, one being the King's birthday, and the other being Midsummer\r\nDay. The reason for keeping this latter day is thus mentioned in a MS.\r\ndiary of the mining operations at Louisbourg, now in the Royal Artillery\r\nRecord Office, which belonged to Sir John Ligonier:—\"According to\r\ntradition among the miners, Midsummer was the first that found out the\r\ncopper mines in Cornwall, for which occasion they esteem this a holy\r\nday, and all the miners come from below ground to carouse, and drink to\r\nthe good old man's memory.\"\r\n\r\nThe fortifications of Louisbourg have never been rebuilt; and with the\r\ndisappearance of its garrison its importance vanished. Cape Breton and\r\nthe Island of St. John, now called Prince Edward's Island, fell into\r\nEnglish hands almost immediately, and have never since been ruled by any\r\nother. The former is now part of Nova Scotia; its capital is no longer\r\nLouisbourg, but Sydney; and its French population has vanished—being\r\nreplaced, to a great extent, by Highlanders from Scotland.\r\n\r\nAlthough the purpose of this work has made the Artillery part of the\r\narmy's duties the most prominent in the chapter, it cannot be denied\r\nthat, to the ordinary reader, Wolfe is the centre of attraction. The\r\ntime was drawing near when the brave spirit which animated him at\r\nLouisbourg was to fire his exhausted and weary frame, and raise him from\r\nhis sickbed to that encounter on the Plains of Abraham, which his own\r\ndeath and that of his opponent were to render famous for all time. And\r\nthe fire which then breathed life for the moment into his own frame\r\ninspired the men under his command at Louisbourg. The foremost duties,\r\nthe posts of danger, were always his; and with such a guide his\r\nfollowers never failed. On one evening in June he was issuing orders to\r\nhis division, which was to be employed during the night in bringing up\r\nguns to a new and exposed post. It was necessary to warn the men that\r\nthe fire of the enemy would be probably warmer than usual, to check the\r\nworking-parties: but with simple confidence, he said, \"He does not doubt\r\nbut that the officers and soldiers will co-operate with their usual\r\nspirit, that they may have at least their share in the \"honours of this\r\nenterprise.\" Of a truth, he who asks his men to do nothing that he will\r\nnot do himself,—who trusts them, instead of worrying and doubting them,—\r\nand who holds before his own eyes and theirs that ideal of duty which is\r\nof all virtues the most God-like, is the man to _lead_ men; and such a\r\nman was Wolfe.\r\n\r\nLouisbourg and Quebec—two words—yet on Wolfe's grave they would mean\r\npages of heroism.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 23:\r\n\r\n  Murdoch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX.\r\n                       MINDEN,—AND AFTER MINDEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCERTAIN Goths and Vandals, connected with the Board of Ordnance in 1799,\r\nissued an order granting permission for the destruction of many old\r\ndocuments which had accumulated in the Battalion offices at Woolwich\r\nsince the year 1758. Had these been vouchers for pecuniary outlay, it is\r\nbut just to the Honourable Board to say that this permission would never\r\nhave been granted. But as they referred merely to such trumpery matters\r\nas expenditure of life, and the stories of England's military\r\noperations, no reluctance was displayed, nor any trouble taken to\r\ndistinguish between what might have proved useful, and useless to\r\nposterity. A gap consequently occurs in the official records of the 1st\r\nand 2nd Battalions, which increases twentyfold the labours of the\r\nstudent.\r\n\r\nThe Battle of Minden was fought during the years represented by that\r\ngap, and the difficulties to be overcome in tracing the identical\r\ncompanies of the Royal Artillery which were engaged can only be realised\r\nby the reader, who has himself had to burrow among old records and\r\nmutilated volumes. The main purpose in this history being to strengthen\r\nthe _Battery_ as well as the _Regimental esprit_, it was of the utmost\r\nimportance that the Companies, which did so much to decide the contest\r\non that eventful day, should be discovered with certainty, for the sake\r\nof the existing Batteries who are entitled to their glory, by virtue of\r\nsuccession; and—to make certain that no hasty conclusions have been\r\narrived at—it has been thought desirable to give the data on which they\r\nhave been based.\r\n\r\nMinden was fought in 1759. Fortunately, a fresh distribution of the\r\ncompanies in the two existing Battalions took place in the preceding\r\nyear; and the names of the officers in each company are given at length\r\nin Cleaveland's MS. notes.\r\n\r\nNow three companies are known to have been present at Minden. Of one,\r\nCaptain Phillips', there is fortunately no doubt. It was then No. 5\r\nCompany of the 1st Battalion; and after long and glorious service became\r\non the 1st July, 1859, No. 7 Battery, 14th Brigade, when that change in\r\nthe nomenclature of the companies took place, which is always baffling\r\nthe student. On the 1st January, 1860, the exigencies of the service\r\nrequired yet another christening, and it became, on transfer, No. 4\r\nBattery of the 13th Brigade, which it now is. This Battery was\r\nundoubtedly present at Minden.\r\n\r\nThe tracing of the other two companies is not so easy. It is on record\r\nthat one was commanded by Captain Cleaveland. In 1758, this officer was\r\nin command of No. 2 Company of the 2nd Battalion, but in the winter of\r\nthat year he exchanged with Captain Tovey, of the 1st Battalion, and\r\nalmost immediately marched with his new company to join the Allied\r\nArmies on the Continent. This was then No. 4 Company of the 1st\r\nBattalion; and as Captain Cleaveland exchanged into it on the 30th\r\nOctober, 1758, and was in Germany with his Company in the beginning of\r\nDecember, (no second exchange having taken place,) there can be little\r\ndoubt that another of the Companies at Minden was No. 4 Company of the\r\n1st Battalion, now designated No. 3 Battery of the 5th Brigade.\r\n\r\nJudging from a mention of Captain Drummond in one of Prince Ferdinand's\r\ndespatches, the third company present at the battle would at first sight\r\nappear to have been No. 6 of the 2nd Battalion, commanded by Captain\r\nThomas Smith,—Captain Drummond being at that date his Captain-\r\nLieutenant. But there is no mention of Captain Smith in any of the\r\ndespatches; and as there is a very frequent and most honourable mention\r\nof Captain Forbes Macbean, who was undoubtedly present in command of one\r\nof the companies, it would appear that Captain-Lieutenant Drummond must\r\nhave been transferred to some other company for this service.\r\nFortunately the Records of the 1st Battalion—generally a wilderness at\r\nthis time—contain a key to the solution of the difficulty, for they show\r\nthat Captain Forbes Macbean (on his promotion on 1st January, 1759, the\r\nvery year that Minden was fought) took command of No. 8 Company of the\r\n1st Battalion, now A Battery, 11th Brigade. As he never exchanged, and\r\nis specially mentioned as having _taken his company_ to Germany, this\r\nmay be assumed with certainty to have been the third of the companies\r\npresent at Minden.\r\n\r\nA little confusion has been caused by the mention of Captain Foy in\r\nPrince Ferdinand's General Order after the battle; and one writer,\r\ngenerally marvellously accurate, assumes that he commanded one of the\r\ncompanies engaged. But, in the first place, he was then merely a\r\nCaptain-Lieutenant, and much junior even to Captain Drummond, and, in\r\nthe second, he was then holding a special appointment, namely, that of\r\nBridge-master to the Artillery. Although he and Captain Drummond had\r\nundoubtedly each charge of some guns during the battle, he was certainly\r\nnot there with his Company. Indeed, in a contemporary notice, we find\r\nthat this officer proceeded _alone_ to join the Allied Army in the\r\ncapacity named above. He held a similar appointment in America\r\nafterwards for nine years, and died in that country in 1779.\r\n\r\nThe two most prominent of the Artillery officers present at Minden were\r\nCaptain Phillips, who commanded, and Captain Macbean; and both deserve\r\nmore than passing notice. The former joined the Regiment as a cadet\r\ngunner in 1746, became Lieutenant-Fireworker in the following year,\r\nSecond Lieutenant in 1755, and First Lieutenant in 1756. When holding\r\nthis rank, he was appointed to the command of a company of miners raised\r\nin 1756 for duty in Minorca, but no longer required after the\r\ncapitulation of Port Mahon. Instead of disbanding them, however, the\r\nBoard of Ordnance converted them into a company of Artillery, and added\r\nthem to the Regiment. Greatly to the indignation of the officers of a\r\ncorps, whose promotion then, as now, was by seniority, Lieutenant\r\nPhillips was transferred with the company, as a Captain, without having\r\npassed through the intermediate grade of Captain-Lieutenant. If the end\r\never justifies the means, this job on the part of Sir John Ligonier,\r\nthen Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance, was justified by Captain\r\nPhillips' subsequent career both in Germany and in America. A minor\r\npoint in connection with this officer is worthy of mention. He was the\r\nfirst to originate a band in the Royal Artillery—not a permanent one,\r\nhowever—the present Band only dating as far back as 1771, when the 4th\r\nBattalion was formed, and with it the nucleus of what has developed into\r\nprobably the best military band in the world. Captain Phillips died—a\r\ngeneral officer—in Virginia, in the year 1781, from illness contracted\r\non active service.\r\n\r\nForbes Macbean, the next most worthy of mention, began his career in the\r\nRegiment, as a Cadet Matross, and died in 1800 as Colonel-Commandant of\r\nthe Invalid Battalion. He was present at Fontenoy, as has already been\r\nmentioned; in Germany during the campaign of which Minden was part; in\r\nPortugal, where he reached the rank of Inspector-General of the\r\nPortuguese Artillery; and in Canada, in the years 1778-9, as commanding\r\nthe Royal Artillery. He is mentioned in Kane's List, as having been the\r\nsecond officer in the Regiment who obtained the blue ribbon of Science,\r\nthe Fellowship of the Royal Society—an honour borne by a good many in\r\nthe Regiment now, and valued by every one who appreciates its position\r\nas a scientific corps.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Minden was the first during the operations in Germany of\r\nthe Allied Army under Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick, at which special\r\nnotice was made of the English troops.\r\n\r\nThese operations commenced in 1757, the year in which Prince Ferdinand\r\nassumed the command of the Allied Army, and terminated in 1762. On the\r\n8th March, 1758, Prince Ferdinand captured Minden from the French—a town\r\nsituated on the river Weser, about 45 miles W.S.W. from Hanover; and\r\nretained possession of it until July, 1759, when it was retaken from\r\nGeneral Zastrow and his Hessian troops by the French under M. de\r\nBroglio.\r\n\r\nDuring this interval, however, the Allied Army had been strengthened by\r\nthe arrival of the following Regiments from England, sent by King\r\nGeorge, as Elector of Brunswick-Luneberg, viz., _Cavalry_: Horse Guards\r\nBlue, Bland's, Howard's, Inniskillen, and Mordaunt's. _Infantry_:\r\nNapier's, Kingsley's, Welsh Fusiliers, Home's, and Stuart's.\r\n\r\nThese were afterwards joined by the North British Dragoons, and\r\nBrudenel's Regiment of Foot. The Artillery which first accompanied this\r\nforce consisted of a Captain, six subalterns, and 120 non-commissioned\r\nofficers and men, but in 1759 it was reinforced to a total strength of\r\nthree companies. At first nothing but light 6-pounders had come, for use\r\nas battalion guns, and had this state of matters remained unaltered,\r\nthis chapter need never have been written. But with the reinforcements\r\nof 1759 came also twenty-eight guns of heavier calibre, and the\r\nArtillery was now divided into independent Brigades or Batteries, with a\r\nproportion merely of battalion guns; and as it now ceased to march in\r\none column, as had formerly been the case, the great kettledrums were no\r\nlonger carried with the companies.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1759, the French re-occupied Minden; and, outside the town,\r\nPrince Ferdinand was encamped with his Army, the right resting on Minden\r\nMarsh, the left on the Weser, but on a somewhat extended arc, and with\r\nintervals so great as to appear dangerous. He resolved to make a stand\r\nagainst the French, who had been considerably strengthened and were now\r\nunder the command of M. de Contades. The French Commander had obtained\r\npermission from Paris to attack the Allies, and on the evening of the\r\n31st July he issued the most detailed orders to his army as to the hours\r\nof movement, disposition of the troops, and order of battle. Prince\r\nFerdinand anticipating the movements of the French, had issued orders\r\nfor his army to march at 5 A.M. on the morning of the 1st August, moving\r\nin eight columns towards Minden, thus narrowing the arc on which they\r\nwould deploy, and proportionately diminishing the intervals. By the hour\r\nthe Allies marched, the French, who had moved two hours before, were\r\ndrawn up in order of battle, and at 6.30 A.M. the Allied Army was\r\nsimilarly formed. The appearance of the armies now was that of the arcs\r\nof two concentric circles, Minden being the centre, and the French Army\r\nbeing on the inner and smaller arc. The French had confidence in\r\nsuperior numbers—in the protection of the guns of the fortress in case\r\nof retreat—and in the prestige of recent successes. Their commander had\r\nboasted of his intention of surrounding Prince Ferdinand's army, and\r\nsending their capitulation to Paris. His plan was to make a powerful\r\nattack on General Wangenheim's corps, the left of the Allied Army, and\r\nsomewhat detached from the main body; which he hoped to turn. But, as\r\nthe event turned out, Wangenheim's division did not change its position\r\nduring the whole engagement. About 7 A.M. a French battery commenced\r\nharassing the English Artillery, as it advanced in column of route on\r\nright of the Allied infantry; but as soon as possible Captain Macbean\r\nbrought his battery—known as the heavy brigade—into action, and soon\r\nsilenced the enemy's fire. Although he had only ten medium 12-pounders,\r\nmanned by his own and Captain Phillips's companies—and two of these were\r\ndisabled during this Artillery duel—he succeeded in overcoming a battery\r\nof thirty guns. While he was thus engaged, the celebrated attack of the\r\nBritish infantry on the French cavalry was taking place. The British,\r\naccompanied by the Hanoverian Guards, and Hardenberg's Regiment, marched\r\nfor some 150 paces, exposed both to a cross fire from the enemy's\r\nbatteries, and a musketry fire from the infantry; but, notwithstanding\r\ntheir consequent losses, and their continued exposure on both flanks, so\r\nunshaken were they, and so courageously did they fight, that in a very\r\nshort time the French cavalry was routed. It is doubtful if their\r\ngallantry has ever been exceeded. Captain Macbean, being now at leisure,\r\nadvanced his battery, came into action to the left, and—first preventing\r\nthe French cavalry from reforming—followed by opening fire upon the\r\nSaxon troops who were now attacking the British infantry. The value of\r\nthis assistance was very great.\r\n\r\nOn the left of the Allies, the Artillery fire was equally successful,\r\nand the Hanoverians and Hessians greatly distinguished themselves.\r\nNotwithstanding the unhappy and severely expiated blunder of Lord George\r\nSackville, in failing to obey the orders for advancing his cavalry,\r\nbefore 10 A.M. the French army fled in confusion. At this time, Prince\r\nFerdinand advanced the English guns on the right, as close to the morass\r\nas they could be taken, to prevent the French from returning to their\r\nold camp on the Minden side of Dutzen; and in this he completely\r\nsucceeded,—the enemy being compelled to retire behind the high ground,\r\nwith their right on the Weser. The victorious army encamped on the field\r\nof battle, and on totalling their losses, they were found to amount to\r\n2800 killed and wounded, 1394 of that number being British. The French\r\nlost in killed, wounded, and prisoners, between 7000 and 8000; besides\r\n43 cannon, 10 pairs of colours, and 7 standards.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Artillery had present on this memorable day in addition to\r\nCaptain Macbean's heavy brigade, two light 12-pounders, three light 6-\r\npounders, and four howitzers, under Captain-Lieutenant Drummond; and\r\nfour light 12-pounders, three light 6-pounders, and two howitzers, under\r\nCaptain-Lieutenant Foy. There were also twelve light 6-pounders with six\r\nBritish battalions. Captain Phillips commanded the whole three companies\r\nat the battle.\r\n\r\nThe two points which strike one most after the perusal of the accounts\r\nof this engagement are the stolidity and nerve of English infantry under\r\nfire, and the advantage of independent action on the part of Field\r\nArtillery.\r\n\r\nMinden was a cruel blow at the system of battalion guns. And although\r\nbattalion guns have long disappeared, the mere concentration of them\r\ninto batteries was not enough, while those batteries had to accommodate\r\ntheir movements to those of the battalions to which they were attached.\r\nBilled ordnance—with a range double that of the infantry weapon—had been\r\nin existence for years; and yet general officers at reviews and field-\r\ndays made the batteries keep with the battalions;—advancing, retiring,\r\ndressing together, as if the only advantage of a gun over a rifle was\r\nthe size of the projectile, and not also increased range. It seemed\r\nnever to dawn upon their understanding that by bringing their Artillery\r\nwithin range of the enemy's infantry fire, as by their system they\r\ncertainly did, they would ensure for their batteries, after half an\r\nhour's engagement, a ghastly paraphernalia of dead horses and empty\r\nsaddles. It was not until the year 1871, that an order was issued by one\r\nwho is at once Commander-in-Chief of the Army, and Colonel of the Royal\r\nArtillery, giving to field batteries in the field that inestimable boon,\r\ncomparative freedom of action. The lesson was a long time in learning;\r\nand one of the best teachers was one of the oldest—this very Battle of\r\nMinden—which, in the words of one who took part in it, was of such\r\nimportance in its results, that it \"entirely defeated the French views,\r\ndisconcerted all their schemes, and rescued Hanover, Brunswick, and\r\nHesse from the rapacious hands of a cruel ambitious, and elated enemy.\"\r\n\r\nOn the day after the battle, Prince Ferdinand issued a General Order,\r\nthanking the army for their gallantry, and particularizing, among\r\nothers, \"the three English Captains, Phillips, Drummond, and Foy;\" and\r\non discovering that he had omitted mention of Captain Macbean, he wrote\r\nthe following letter to him in his own hand.\r\n\r\n  \"_To_ Captain MACBEAN, _of the British Artillery._\r\n\r\n  \"SIR,—It is from a sense of your merit, and a regard to justice,\r\n  that I do in this manner declare I have reason to be infinitely\r\n  satisfied with your behaviour, activity, and zeal, which in so\r\n  conspicuous a manner you made appear at the battle of Thonhausen, on\r\n  the 1st of August. The talents you possess in your profession did\r\n  not a little contribute to render our fire superior to that of the\r\n  enemy, and it is to you and your Brigade that I am indebted for\r\n  having silenced the fire of a battery of the enemy, which extremely\r\n  galled the troops, and particularly the British infantry.\r\n\r\n  \"Accept then, sir, from me the just tribute of my most perfect\r\n  acknowledgment, accompanied by my most sincere thanks. I shall be\r\n  happy in every opportunity of obliging you, desiring only occasions\r\n  of proving it; being with the most distinguished esteem,\r\n\r\n                \"Your devoted and entirely affectionate servant,\r\n                      (Signed)                 \"FERDINAND,\r\n                                      \"Duke of Brunswic and Luneberg.\"\r\n\r\nSubsequently, as a further proof of his appreciation of the services of\r\nthe Royal Artillery at Minden or Thonhausen, as the battle was also\r\nnamed, the Prince directed the following gratuities to be presented to\r\nthe senior officers:—\r\n\r\n                To Captain William Phillips 1000 crowns.\r\n                   Captain Forbes Macbean    500 crowns.\r\n                   Captain Duncan Drummond   500 crowns.\r\n                   Captain Edward Foy        500 crowns.\r\n\r\nThe story of the remaining operations of the Allied Army, in so far as\r\nthey bear upon the services of the Royal Artillery, may be briefly\r\nstated. In 1760, two additional companies were sent to Germany, the\r\nRegiment having in the interim been augmented by a third battalion. The\r\nBritish guns now with the army were as follows:—eight heavy, twelve\r\nmedium, and six light 12-pounders; thirty light 6-pounders; three 8-\r\ninch, and six Royal mortars. Before the end of the war the armament was\r\nchanged to eight heavy, six medium, and four light 12-pounders; twenty-\r\nfour heavy, and thirty-four light 6-pounders; eight 8-inch, and four\r\nRoyal howitzers. Captain Macbean is the prominent Artillery officer\r\nduring the rest of the campaign: except, perhaps, at Warberg, where, on\r\nthe 30th July, 1760, Captain Phillips astounded every one by bringing up\r\nthe Artillery at a gallop, and so seconding the attack as utterly to\r\nprevent the enemy, who had passed the Dymel, from forming on the other\r\nside; and by the accuracy and rapidity of his fire, converting their\r\nretreat into a precipitate rout. Perhaps it was young blood that\r\nprompted this unexpected action; for, as has already been stated, he was\r\nbut a boy compared with most captains; if so, it contributes somewhat to\r\natone for Sir John Ligonier's favouritism. More than thirty years were\r\nto pass before Horse Artillery should form part of the British army, and\r\nshow what mobility it was possible to attain; and more than a century\r\nere Field Artillery should reach the perfection it now possesses, a\r\nperfection which treads closely on the heels of the more brilliant\r\nbranch. During the Seven Years' War, so unwieldy was the movement of\r\nArtillery in the field, that this little episode, which makes modern\r\nlips smile, was thought worthy of a record denied to events which would\r\nnow be considered far more important.\r\n\r\nAlthough more than two years passed between the Battle of Minden and the\r\nconclusion of peace, the custom which then prevailed of armies going\r\ninto winter-quarters curtailed the time for active operations; and even\r\nwhen the forces were manœuvring, much of the time was spent in empty\r\nmarching and counter-marching. At Warberg, as at Minden, the heaviest\r\nloss fell upon the English troops, of whom 590 were killed or wounded;\r\ntheir gallantry—more especially in the case of the Highlanders and\r\ngrenadiers—being again conspicuous. Among the trophies taken on this\r\noccasion from the enemy were ten guns.\r\n\r\nThe fortune of war changed repeatedly; and the British troops received\r\nfurther reinforcements, including three battalions of the Guards. Lord\r\nGeorge Sackville having been cashiered was succeeded in the command of\r\nthe English contingent by the Marquis of Granby; and a cheerful feeling\r\nprevailed among the troops, since the news had arrived of the conquest\r\nof Canada.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th February, 1761, Captain Macbean received the brevet rank of\r\nMajor, and was ordered to proceed with a brigade of eight heavy 12-\r\npounders, to join the Hereditary Prince near Fritzlar, on the following\r\nday. This town was garrisoned by 1200 French troops under M. de\r\nNarbonne; and Major Macbean—having been entrusted with the command of\r\nthe whole Artillery of the Prince's army—commenced the bombardment on\r\nthe 14th, placing his batteries within 300 yards of the wall, and\r\nadvancing some light pieces even nearer, to scour the parapet with\r\ngrape. As, however, he had no guns heavier than 12-pounders, and the\r\nwalls were made of flint, his fire, although hot and steady, made little\r\nor no impression; nor could he do much damage to the gates, which were\r\nbarricaded with felled trees, and immense heaps of earth and stones.\r\n\r\nThe Hereditary Prince, although expressing himself pleased with Major\r\nMacbean's dispositions, was evidently impatient to take the city; so\r\nMajor Macbean suggested shelling it with howitzers, a suggestion which\r\nwas approved of. So successful was the fire, that in about an hour's\r\ntime the enemy capitulated, being allowed to march out with the honours\r\nof war.\r\n\r\nMajor Macbean received the Prince's special thanks; and the town was\r\nordered to pay him 4000 crowns in lieu of their bells, a perquisite in\r\nthose days of the commanding officer of Artillery, when a siege was\r\ncrowned with success.\r\n\r\nFrom this time, matters looked well for the Allies. On the 25th June,\r\n1761, news reached the army of the reduction of Belleisle; and in\r\nOctober, 1762, tidings of the British successes at the Havannah arrived.\r\nOn both occasions, a _feu de joie_ was fired. On the 1st November, 1762,\r\nCassel capitulated; a signal victory was gained over the combined\r\nAustrians and Imperialists, near Freytag, by Prince Henry of Prussia,\r\nwhich filled the Allied camp with joy; and on the 14th November, word\r\nreached the army that the preliminaries of peace had been signed at\r\nFontainebleau. On the 24th December, Prince Ferdinand wrote to King\r\nGeorge, congratulating him on the peace, and asking permission to quit\r\nthe army, where his presence was no longer necessary; and at the same\r\ntime he announced to the British troops, that the remembrance of their\r\ngallantry would not cease but with his life; and that \"by the skill of\r\ntheir officers he had been enabled at the same time to serve his\r\ncountry, and to make a suitable return for the confidence which His\r\nBritannic Majesty had been pleased to honour him with.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 13th January, 1763, the thanks of the House of Commons was\r\nconveyed to the British troops for \"their meritorious and eminent\r\nservices;\" and on the 25th January, their homeward march through Holland\r\ncommenced; through the provinces of Guelderland, Nimeguen, and Breda, to\r\nWilliamstadt, where they took ship for England.\r\n\r\nAnd, as sleep on the eyes of the weary, so peace descended for a time on\r\nthose towns and hamlets by the Weser and the Rhine, which had been for\r\nso many years unwilling pawns on the great chess-board of war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XX.\r\n        THE THIRD BATTALION.—THE HISTORY AND PRESENT DESIGNATION\r\n                           OF THE COMPANIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOT very long after the Battle of Minden, and while the lessons of the\r\nwar were urging on the military world the increasing importance of\r\nArtillery, the Board of Ordnance resolved to increase the Royal\r\nArtillery still further. This was done by transferring five companies\r\nfrom the existing battalions, and by raising five others; the ten being\r\ncombined into the Third Battalion with a staff similar to that of the\r\nother two. Each company of the battalion consisted of a Captain, a\r\nCaptain-Lieutenant, a First and Second Lieutenant, 3 Lieutenant-\r\nFireworkers, 3 sergeants, 3 corporals, 8 bombardiers, 20 gunners, 62\r\nmatrosses, and 2 drummers; making a total of 105 per company.\r\n\r\nThe total of all ranks, on the formation of the battalion, was 1054. At\r\nthe end of the Seven Years' War, the battalion was reduced to 554; but\r\nas the troubles in America became visible, it was again increased; and\r\nin 1779, the establishment of all ranks stood at 1145. At the peace of\r\n1783, it fell to 648; rising, however, in 1793, during England's\r\ncontinental troubles, to 1240. It reached its maximum during the\r\nPeninsular War, when its strength was no less than 1461 of all ranks. In\r\nthe year 1778, when the 4th Battalion was raised, two companies were\r\ntaken from the 3rd; but they were replaced in 1779.\r\n\r\nFor thirty years after the reductions made in 1816, the average strength\r\nof the battalion was 700; but from that time it gradually rose until, at\r\nthe commencement of the war with Russia, it stood at 1128, and in the\r\nfollowing year it reached 1220.\r\n\r\nThere is a little obscurity as to the services of this battalion during\r\nthe American War of Independence. One set of documents claims for Nos. 1\r\nand 6 Companies, no inconsiderable share in the earlier part of the\r\ncampaign; another asserts that to the 4th Battalion alone does all the\r\ncredit, which the Artillery during that war especially merited, belong.\r\nThe truth seems to be, that, in 1778, two companies of the 3rd Battalion\r\nwere in America, and were engaged in several battles; but that in 1779,\r\nthe men of these companies were drafted into those of the 4th Battalion,\r\nand their officers returned to England.\r\n\r\nThe fusion was not, however, complete; for we find traces of No. 1\r\nCompany of the 3rd Battalion in America so late as 1781, when a\r\ndetachment of it was present at Guildford Court-house.\r\n\r\nNo fewer than seven companies of the battalion were engaged in the West\r\nIndies in the last decade of the eighteenth century; five companies\r\nserved in the Peninsula, four being present at the Battle of Corunna;\r\neight companies served on the Walcheren expedition; and four companies—\r\nNos. 2, 4, 7, 9—were present at the Battle of Waterloo. At this battle\r\ndetachments of Nos. 5 and 6 Companies were also present.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the Crimean war, although the strength of the\r\nbattalion was considerable, it only consisted of eight companies, two\r\nhaving been reduced in 1819; and of these eight, no fewer than six took\r\npart in the war.\r\n\r\nAppended is a list—as in the case of the 1st and 2nd Battalions—showing,\r\nin anticipation, the various military operations in which the companies\r\nof the 3rd Battalion were engaged—the succession of Captains, as far as\r\ncan be traced down to 1859—and the nomenclature introduced in that year,\r\nwhen Battalions and Companies became Brigades and Batteries.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     No. 1 COMPANY, 3rd BATTALION,\r\n                     Now \"A\" BATTERY, 4th BRIGADE.\r\n\r\n ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n Battles, Sieges, and other Military operations in which this Company\r\n   has been engaged.\r\n ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n 1776-1783.

There have been events\r\nwhich have had no perceptible effect on the progress of the campaigns,\r\nand yet are indissolubly woven in our Regimental annals. Of such events\r\nthe siege of Belleisle is a type.\r\n\r\nDuring the Seven Years' War, England made various diversions—in addition\r\nto those in America and the East Indies—to distract the French in their\r\noperations against the Allied Army in Germany. One of these was the\r\nattack on the Island of Belleisle on the west coast of France, between\r\nPort Louis and the mouth of the Loire. It was devised in the hope of\r\ninducing the French to detach some of their forces from Germany, for the\r\ndefence of their own coasts; but in this respect it failed. Another\r\nmotive, which inspired the English Government, was that they might\r\ngratify the lust for conquest, which at that time animated the people,\r\nwhetted instead of satiated by their successes in the East and in the\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nTo a certain extent, it succeeded in this; but after counting the cost\r\nof the victory, it required the most exaggerated statements on the part\r\nof the Ministry to reconcile the nation to the expenditure of life and\r\nmoney caused by the Siege of Belleisle, if indeed it can be said ever to\r\nhave been reconciled.\r\n\r\nThe English nation has characteristics, which are displayed at every\r\nstage of its history. Lavish during war in order to gain its ends, it is\r\ndisposed to be penurious during peace; and the favourite stalking-horse\r\nto power then is a profession of economy. The whole of Europe stood\r\namazed at the readiness with which the English nation granted enormous\r\nsupplies for the carrying on of the war ending in 1762; and this had\r\nperhaps as much effect as military success in persuading the French to\r\nconsent to the disastrous conditions of the Peace of Paris. It may be\r\nsaid that, as a nation, the English sink political differences during\r\nwar, and show a union almost peculiar to themselves. The only case in\r\nwhich war and political differences existed simultaneously to any great\r\nextent was during the American War of Independence; the reasons then\r\nwere exceptional, and the result fatal.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of political union, comes a demand for vigorous\r\nadministration; and the success of Mr. Pitt's ministry was due to his\r\nknowledge of this. The Siege of Belleisle was an illustration of this\r\nknowledge. It cannot be said that in time of peace the English insist on\r\nsuch administrative vigour; in fact, vigorous action in the head of a\r\ndepartment is viewed with distrust and suspicion more frequently than\r\nwith admiration. It is by remembering considerations such as these that\r\na military operation such as is now to be described can be understood,\r\nalmost valueless in its political results, expensive in its conduct,\r\nand—in a military point of view—worthless, save in so far as it\r\nstrengthened (as only success can do) the _esprit_ and courage of the\r\nArmy.\r\n\r\nBut to the Artilleryman this siege has an interest far above political\r\nconsiderations; it was one of the earliest schools for developing that\r\nwhich is the most scientific, albeit less brilliant branch of the\r\nRegiment,—Siege Artillery. And it was suitable that the man who\r\ncommanded the siege-train on this occasion should be one eminent\r\nafterwards in the scientific as well as the military world: a Fellow of\r\nthe Royal Society as well as a practical soldier: a fit predecessor to\r\nthe many who have since distinguished the Regiment by their learning—\r\nBrigadier Desaguliers.\r\n\r\nThe Artillery present at the siege consisted of two companies from\r\nPortsmouth, Captain Tovey's and Captain Hind's, with about seventy\r\nminers; besides eleven detachments for battalion guns, and others for\r\nservice on board the bomb-vessels.\r\n\r\nThere were no less than thirty-seven Artillery officers employed in the\r\nexpedition. Of these, Captain-Lieutenant Muckell was killed, and the\r\nfollowing were wounded: Brigadier Desaguliers, Lieutenant N.\r\nKindersley,—the Acting Adjutant, Lieutenant E. Williams, and Lieutenant-\r\nFireworker A. McKenzie. The following is a list of the officers who did\r\nduty in the trenches, in addition to those named above:—\r\n\r\n                                  Captain A. TOVEY.\r\n                                  Captain R. HIND.\r\n                       Captain-Lieutenant WILLIAMS.\r\n                       Captain-Lieutenant STEHELIN.\r\n                       Captain-Lieutenant JONES.\r\n                       Captain-Lieutenant GROVE.\r\n                       Captain-Lieutenant MARTIN.\r\n                               Lieutenant WILSON.\r\n                               Lieutenant WALKER.\r\n                               Lieutenant ROGERS.\r\n                               Lieutenant SCOTT.\r\n                               Lieutenant WALKER.\r\n                               Lieutenant PEARSE.\r\n                               Lieutenant BRIETZCHE.\r\n                               Lieutenant GOWEN.\r\n                               Lieutenant TURNER.\r\n                               Lieutenant SCHALCH.\r\n                               Lieutenant LAWSON.\r\n                               Lieutenant PARRY.\r\n                    Lieutenant-Fireworker ROSAT.\r\n                    Lieutenant-Fireworker SKOTTOWE.\r\n                    Lieutenant-Fireworker MAYNE.\r\n\r\nThere were also two medical officers attached to the Artillery.\r\n\r\nWhen, in the early part of 1761, preparations for an expedition on a\r\nlarge scale were commenced at Portsmouth, it was imagined that the\r\ndestination of the fleet was either the East or West Indies. The vessels\r\nwere provisioned for twelve months; there were no less than 35\r\ntransports; and the only difficulty that spectators and gossips had to\r\novercome was the fact that an immense number of flat-bottomed boats,\r\ncapable each of carrying 60 men, was to form part of the fleet. Those\r\nwere days when newspaper reporters and interviewers were not licensed as\r\nnow; and when inquisitive members of Parliament had to content\r\nthemselves with very evasive replies.\r\n\r\nIn addition to a powerful fleet and Artillery, no less than fifteen\r\nbattalions of infantry and three troops of Burgoyne's horse accompanied\r\nthe expedition. The command of the troops was given to Major-General\r\nStudholm Hodgson, with several Brigadiers to assist him, some of whom\r\nbore names which we shall meet again during the War of Independence,\r\nHowe, Burgoyne, and Carleton. The fleet was under the command of\r\nCommodore Keppel; and it was intended that much of the work should be\r\ndone by it, as the nation had of late been somewhat outspoken as to the\r\ninaction of the navy, nor were Admiral Byng and Minorca forgotten.\r\n\r\nWhen the fleet first sailed from Portsmouth on the 29th March, 1761,\r\nCaptain Tovey commanded the Artillery; but on the 5th April Colonel\r\nDesaguliers was ordered by the King to proceed (with the rank of\r\nBrigadier) to Portsmouth: the miners were ordered to the same place to\r\njoin Captain Hind's company; the whole to proceed without delay to\r\nBelleisle, whither it was now known the expedition had gone. The gallant\r\nBrigadier was no sluggard; at midnight on the 6th April—those were not\r\nthe days of railways—he reached Portsmouth, sent word to Captain Hind to\r\nhave his company ready at a moment's notice, went himself on board the\r\n'Blast' transport on the afternoon of the 7th, and sailed at daybreak\r\nthe following morning.\r\n\r\nThe same energy displayed itself on his reaching Belleisle. The\r\nexpedition had already met with misfortune. An attempt had been made on\r\nthe 8th April to land 300 men on the south-east of the island, after a\r\nheavy and apparently successful bombardment from the fleet; but the\r\nenemy charged them with superior numbers before they could form, and\r\ntook them all prisoners, besides inflicting a loss on some detachments\r\nwhich landed to assist them, of 37 killed and 76 wounded.\r\n\r\nA heavy gale followed, in which 20 boats were lost and many vessels\r\ndriven to sea; the introduction to a continuation of frightful weather\r\nwhich lasted during the whole siege. On the 12th April, Brigadier\r\nDesaguliers arrived; learnt what had taken place; immediately ordered\r\nthe battalion guns to be placed in the Ordnance boats,—ready to\r\naccompany the troops on the next attempt at a landing, coming into\r\naction so as to enable the infantry to form up on the shore; got his\r\nwarrant as commanding the Royal Artillery published in orders; appointed\r\nCaptain-Lieutenant Stehelin his Brigade Major; and volunteered to\r\nreconnoitre the island for a landing-place.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd, Captain Hind's company, with the miners, some other troops,\r\nand an immense quantity of Artillery stores, reached Belleisle. It had\r\nby this time been resolved to attempt a landing near the place, where\r\nthe first had failed; but with a view to deceiving the enemy, the newly-\r\narrived troops were ordered to get into the ship's boats, and make a\r\nfeint of landing at the Point of Sauzon. The feint succeeded; the fear\r\nof their landing detained a large body of the enemy whose presence would\r\nhave been invaluable in checking the real landing, which was now\r\neffected, under cover of the fire from the fleet, and assisted by the\r\npanic which was created among the enemy by the appearance on their flank\r\nof a number of men who had climbed up some difficult precipices, at a\r\nlittle distance from the spot where the main body landed.\r\n\r\nIn addition to a body of 900 marines, which landed with the other\r\ntroops, the Commodore collected 500 from the ships, and landed them; and\r\nas the Colonel of the Marines, McKenzie, had been wounded, the command\r\nof this large body devolved upon a Captain named Collins, who on account\r\nof the responsibility of his position received the rank of Major.\r\n\r\nFor some days the weather was so tempestuous that it was impossible to\r\nland the heavy guns, or Artillery stores; and the enemy was enabled to\r\nstrengthen his position unmolested. The bomb-vessels stood close in to\r\nthe shore, and plied the Citadel, but without much effect. Picquets of\r\n500 men were on duty every night in the English camp; the inhabitants of\r\nPalais, the capital of the Island, were strictly watched; and a village\r\nin a good position was taken and set fire to, from which circumstance it\r\nwas always after this time called \"the Burnt Village.\" The Artillerymen\r\nwere hard at work making their batteries and parallels, assisted by\r\nlarge working parties from the Line; and every officer in the Army who\r\nknew anything of engineering was invited to submit his name with a view\r\nto employment at an increased rate of pay. The trench work was not a\r\nfavourite duty with the infantry, even after working-pay was allowed for\r\nit; and Brigadier Desaguliers had to make the strongest representations\r\non the subject to General Hodgson. The men did not dislike idling and\r\nloafing about the trenches; it was the spade-work which was unpopular;\r\nand this led to an amusing order being issued, that any Artillery\r\nofficer who found a man near his post, idling or curious, was to \"lay\r\nhold of him, and make him work for 12 hours.\"\r\n\r\nThe town of Palais was soon occupied by the English troops, and being\r\nnear the Citadel, to which the enemy had withdrawn, it afforded\r\nexcellent cover for the English marksmen, whom the reluctance of the\r\nenemy to fire on the town left quite unmolested.\r\n\r\nThe armament for the batteries had at length been landed and mounted,\r\nalthough not without the greatest difficulty. The Brigadier had at this\r\ntime, and later on, repeatedly to acknowledge the assistance he received\r\nfrom the Navy, between which and the Artillery there was then, as now, a\r\nstrong _entente cordiale_.\r\n\r\nAnd now commenced the regular siege:—Sebastopol in miniature; daily and\r\nnightly bombardments; the trenches flooded with rain; and Artillerymen\r\nso reduced in numbers as to be without the requisite rest or relief.\r\nThree important batteries were opened against the Citadel, known\r\nrespectively as the 16-Gun, the 10-Gun, and the 4-Gun Batteries. Mortar\r\nbatteries were made, as the siege progressed, containing two 13-inch,\r\nthree 10-inch, and six 8-inch land-service mortars; two 13-inch, and two\r\n10-inch sea-service mortars; besides fifteen Royal mortars, and ten Coe-\r\nhorn's. The guns in the batteries were heavy 24-pounders, medium 12-\r\npounders, and 8-inch and 4½-inch howitzers. There were a few 3-pounder\r\nguns, and the Battalion guns, which were 6-pounders. Although it is\r\nsomewhat anticipating matters, it may here be mentioned that the\r\nexpenditure of ammunition by the Artillery during the siege amounted to\r\n1500 barrels of powder, 17,000 shot, and 12,000 shell.\r\n\r\nThe infantry had been divided into three brigades, with a total of all\r\nranks of 6254, exclusive of Artillery, Marines, and Burgoyne's horse,\r\nthe last-named being chiefly employed in duties of transport and\r\nforaging. The duties, which were very heavy, were taken alternately by\r\nbrigades. The marines did duty _in corps_, and had to find 378 men for\r\nvarious guards every day.\r\n\r\nWhen Palais was taken, the bells of the churches became, according to\r\ncustom, the property of the commanding officer of Artillery. A piteous\r\nletter, however, was written to him by the priests, pleading the poverty\r\nof their parishes, the destitution of many members of their\r\ncongregations, and the precarious livelihood earned by the most\r\nfortunate, concluding by offering 300 livres in ransom for their bells.\r\n\"So miserable and wretched,\" wrote the Rector of Palais, was his parish\r\nsince the bombardment—more so even than before, when no repairs could be\r\nexecuted without the assistance of private charity, that the Church\r\nwould be unable to exist, did the Commandant of Artillery act on his\r\nrights with rigour.\" They therefore prayed him to leave the bells\r\nuntouched, that the services might be notified to the people; and to\r\nsuffer them to be redeemed by the sum above mentioned: with which\r\nrequest Brigadier Desaguliers complied.\r\n\r\nVarious interesting occurrences took place early in the siege. On the\r\n2nd May, some guns under cavalry escort were ordered to occupy a village\r\non the left of the English camp, which had given considerable annoyance.\r\nSo warm, however, was their reception, that the cavalry withdrew, with\r\nsome precipitation. The guns pressed on, nevertheless, unsupported, for\r\nabout 700 yards, cannonaded the village, and dislodged the enemy.\r\nArtillery in a village, without escort, was a strong temptation; and\r\ntowards night, 300 men made an attempt to cut them off from the main\r\nbody. The gunners were awake, withdrew their guns behind some rising\r\nground about 1450 yards from the Citadel, and kept their assailants at\r\nbay. Next morning, General Hodgson visited the spot, and was so charmed\r\nwith its natural advantages that he ordered it to be entrenched, and\r\nstrong batteries mounted. The same was done at this time in front of the\r\nBurnt Village, about 900 yards from the Citadel.\r\n\r\nThe enemy did not content himself with answering the English cannonade.\r\nSorties were frequent; and on one dark night, Major-General Crawford and\r\nhis staff, taken unawares, were made prisoners in the trenches. Many\r\nmore would have met the same fate, but for the presence of mind of the\r\ngunners in charge of two light field-pieces which happened to be in the\r\ntrenches that evening. They were charged by several hundred men,\r\nincluding a spiking party, but with well-aimed and frequent volleys of\r\ngrape, the gunners utterly routed them.\r\n\r\nThe fire of the enemy was by no means contemptible; in fact, until a\r\nnumber of their guns were dismounted, it was both admirable and\r\neffective. On one occasion, a sergeant and thirteen men in the trenches\r\nwere killed by the explosion of one of the enemy's shells; and so\r\nnumerous at last were the casualties among the Artillery, that the\r\nBrigadier had to apply for 200 men from the infantry to assist in\r\nworking the guns. There was great difficulty in obtaining even that\r\nnumber: the duties of the camp were hard; and the importance of keeping\r\nthe Artillery ranks at a siege well filled was not yet fully understood.\r\nBut with the progress of the siege, came an increase of wisdom; and,\r\nbefore long, not a requisition from the Brigadier was unattended to.\r\n\r\nAll the available sea-service mortars had been landed from the ships;\r\nbut a few vessels of lighter draught stood in to attack the Citadel from\r\nthe sea with their guns. The effect produced was but slight, perhaps\r\nbecause—as an old diary of the siege says—\"There were no Artillery\r\npeople, either officers or men, aboard.\"\r\n\r\nThe English works were gradually approached to within musketry range of\r\nthe Citadel; and to enable the working parties to carry on their duties\r\nwithout molestation from the enemy's marksmen, a heavy and somewhat\r\nwasteful fire was kept up from the batteries, which had at length to be\r\nput a stop to by the Brigadier, for reasons of economy.\r\n\r\nThat the fire of the English Artillery was effective, was ascertained\r\nfrom prisoners, who said, \"Que c'étoit un feu infernal, et qu'on ne\r\nvoyoit ni ciel, ni terre;\" and, when on parole in the town of Palais, a\r\nfavourite joke among the French prisoners, when they saw an Artillery\r\nofficer approaching, was to run behind the nearest cover, shouting \"Gare\r\nla bombe! Gare la bombe!\"\r\n\r\nWhen the second parallel was opened, the Navy commenced landing some 32-\r\npounders to arm a battery which some amateur engineers had made, and as\r\nadditional mortar batteries had also been constructed, the works were\r\nnow so extensive, that the Artillery was utterly unable to man them all.\r\nGeneral Hodgson, accordingly, issued a standing order that as many men\r\nfrom the infantry as Brigadier Desaguliers should require were to be\r\ngiven, and while employed with the Artillery, their pay and allowances\r\nwere to be made equal to those of the matrosses.\r\n\r\nAfter the occupation of Palais by the British troops, much trouble was\r\ncaused by drunkenness among the men, and its concomitants, absence and\r\ninsubordination. The Provost-Marshal was at last ordered to live there,\r\nand got very extensive powers. _Inter alia_, he was permitted \"to _hang_\r\nany soldiers committing _any_ kind of irregularities; above all to lay\r\nhold of any soldier whom he found drunk on duty, and when he became\r\nsober to hang him without trial.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the civil officials of Palais had occasion to come into the\r\ntrenches on business, they were always blindfolded while there. Their\r\nbusiness was generally of a commercial nature: they were ready to accept\r\nEnglish money for their wares, but were anxious to be the appraisers of\r\nthe value of the foreign coins. At last, it was necessary to publish in\r\norders a standard, regulating the comparative values of French and\r\nEnglish specie,—the guinea being valued at 24 livres; and if any\r\ntradesman was found cheating in this respect, he was made liable to\r\nconfiscation of his goods, and corporal punishment.\r\n\r\nAs the siege approached its end, many of the redoubts near the Citadel\r\nfell into the hands of the British; and the duties of the officers of\r\nArtillery became somewhat lighter. It is pleasant to find that, instead\r\nof availing themselves of their comparative leisure, they all\r\nimmediately offered their services as engineers, an offer which was\r\ngreedily accepted.\r\n\r\nThe Ordnance stores were sadly reduced, and the Navy had not another\r\nround to spare; so that fresh requisitions had to be sent to England\r\nmore than once. Pending a reply, a very strict economy was enjoined;\r\nfiring in volleys was forbidden, and single rounds were directed to be\r\nfired day and night at stated intervals. Twenty-four rounds per gun was\r\nlaid down as the daily maximum; but an exception was permitted, should\r\nthe Citadel seem to be on fire, in which case even volleys were allowed.\r\nEven to the end, when the number of available guns in the Citadel was\r\nmuch reduced, the fire of the enemy was excellent; twice the English\r\nmagazines were blown up, and only five days before the capitulation a\r\nmost severe loss was inflicted on the besiegers, Brigadier Desaguliers\r\nhimself being among the wounded.\r\n\r\nThe enemy was able by means of subterranean passages and signalling to\r\nkeep up a constant communication with the mainland. Nor did he confine\r\nhimself to these. An apparently innocent and respectable old lady was\r\nfound traversing the English lines one morning under suspicious\r\ncircumstances. She was questioned without success. Her profession—she\r\nsaid—was simple; she was a washerwoman, and in the exercise of her\r\nvocation had she been seized. A stronger measure was taken: the old lady\r\nwas searched. Her countenance fell as the operation commenced; fell yet\r\nmore as dozens of letters were produced from hidden places, containing\r\npiteous appeals for assistance from the beleaguered citizens. But even\r\nyet she protested her innocence, her astonishment, and her trade; and,\r\nyet protesting, with a rope round her neck, she was led away. Whether\r\nthe rope was afterwards tightened or not, the story does not tell.\r\n\r\nBreaching batteries were opened in front of the second parallel and of\r\nthe town of Palais, the latter at a distance of 230 yards from the\r\nCitadel. It was armed with 24-pounders by the Artillery in a single\r\nnight, although the guns had to be dragged over frightful roads from the\r\nlanding-place, and without any appliances for diminishing the labour.\r\nThe zeal and willingness of the men were unmistakable. Yet a third\r\nbreaching battery was opened to the left of St. Sebastian's Church,\r\nabout 380 yards from the Citadel; and the guns of the original 16-gun\r\nbattery were also brought into play to assist in making the breach. At\r\nfirst the energies of the Artillery were confined to a breach which was\r\nattempted in the Redan du Havre, between the Bastion du Gouvernement and\r\nthe Bastion du Cavalier ou du Roy. But a second breach was afterwards\r\ncommenced in the latter of these Bastions. Powerful enfilading batteries\r\nof howitzers and 12-pounders were opened at the same time, whose fire\r\nproved most efficacious, as was seen after the capitulation by the\r\nnumber of damaged and dismounted guns along the faces of the works. From\r\nthe end of May to the 7th June, the day when the Citadel surrendered,\r\nthere was daily and hourly expectation of submission by the Garrison.\r\nThe prisoners who were taken at this time all agreed in saying that the\r\ncommandant merely waited for a breach being made, before he should\r\ncapitulate. Not merely was the enemy's fire becoming daily weaker, but\r\nthe ammunition was evidently falling short, _wooden_ shot being not\r\nunfrequently fired by him.\r\n\r\nMining had been commenced by the English, a shaft having been sunk under\r\na house in Palais, and a passage commenced under the ditch—which was wet\r\nat high water—towards the Redan du Havre. The miners also made several\r\nattempts by night, when the tide was out, to cross the ditch and enlarge\r\nthe breaches made by the batteries, but without much success, the enemy\r\nbeing alert, and throwing hand-grenades among them as they crossed.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th June, the King's birthday, a tremendous fire was kept up from\r\nall the batteries, and additional ammunition having arrived from\r\nEngland, the Brigadier gave permission for thirty rounds per gun,\r\ninstead of twenty-four, being fired from the ordinary batteries—no limit\r\nbeing placed on the number to be fired from the breaching batteries. The\r\nmortar batteries were now kept silent, the powder being more profitably\r\nemployed for the guns firing against the breaches.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 7th June, no less than ninety-three pieces of\r\nordnance were in use against the Citadel, and on this day the long-\r\nexpected white flag was seen, and an officer came out to make the best\r\nterms he could for the garrison.\r\n\r\nThese were, briefly, that the Citadel with all its stores should be\r\nhanded over to the British troops: that the French garrison should be\r\nprovided with transport to the nearest French port; that the sick and\r\nwounded left behind should be treated in the same manner as the British\r\nsoldiers; and that the inhabitants of the island should be allowed full\r\npermission to worship according to the rites of the Roman Catholic\r\nreligion. Further, in consideration of the gallant defence made by the\r\nChevalier de St. Croix and his troops, they were permitted to march out\r\nof the Citadel with the honours of war, drums beating, colours flying,\r\nlighted matches, and three pieces of cannon with twelve rounds each; and\r\neach soldier carrying fifteen rounds of ammunition in his cartouche box.\r\n\r\nAn inventory of the Ordnance and stores was at once taken by Brigadier\r\nDesaguliers; and on a garrison for the island being decided on, the\r\nfollowing Artillery officers were selected to remain behind, and form\r\npart of it:—Captain Hind, Captain-Lieutenant Martin, Lieutenant Rogers,\r\nand Lieutenant-Fireworkers Rosat, Skottowe, and Mayne. The remainder of\r\nthe Artillery embarked on Christmas Day, 1761, for England.\r\n\r\nAmong the orders issued during the siege, which enable one to form an\r\nidea of the weather which prevailed, is one directing the hides of all\r\nanimals killed for the troops to be taken to the trenches for the use of\r\nthe Artillery in making their expense-magazines water-tight.\r\n\r\nFrom an old order-book in the Royal Artillery Library the discipline of\r\nthe troops after the siege, and the means taken to enforce it, may be\r\nascertained. Three men of the 75th Regiment having been found guilty of\r\ndrunkenness and absence from the King's works, received 300 lashes each,\r\nand were debarred from employment on the works again. Two men of Colonel\r\nMorgan's Regiment having been convicted of disorderly behaviour were\r\nsentenced to receive 200 lashes each \"on their bare backs;\" and another,\r\nin the 19th Regiment, received 100 lashes for drunkenness and\r\ndisobedience. A man in Crawford's Regiment, who had been convicted of\r\nprevarication on a court-martial by which one of his officers was tried,\r\nwas sentenced to receive 500 lashes; but as it appeared by the evidence\r\nthat he had been under pressure and undue influence by the prisoner at\r\nthe time, the sentence was remitted.\r\n\r\nThere seems to have been a want of zeal on the part of the chaplains, if\r\none may judge from the following order:—\"Palais, 26 November, 1761.\r\nWhenever any patient dies in any of the Grand Hospitals, the principal\r\nsurgeon attached to the Hospital where the patient dies is immediately\r\nto send a written report of his death, and the time he would have him\r\ninterred, to the visiting chaplain then in waiting, who is, conformable\r\nto a former order of Major-General Hodgson, to attend the corpse at the\r\ngrave, and read the burial-service over it. General Hodgson is extremely\r\nconcerned that he has occasion to repeat the latter part of this order,\r\nand expects for the future that he shall not hear any complaints on this\r\nsubject.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be mentioned, in concluding this chapter, that at the Peace of\r\n1763 Belleisle was returned to the French in exchange for Minorca, which\r\nEngland had lost at the commencement of the Seven Years' War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXII.\r\n                                 PEACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT the conclusion of the war in 1763, the reductions in the Regiment\r\nwere carried out on a different system from that which had hitherto\r\nprevailed. At the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, entire companies had been\r\nreduced, and the establishment of the remaining companies was left\r\nunchanged. Now, the cadres of the three Battalions with their companies\r\nremained, but the establishment of the latter was materially reduced.\r\nBesides the Cadet company, there were now thirty others; and the total\r\nin each company of all ranks was—as it had been twenty years before—107.\r\nBut the following reduction was now ordered—one Lieutenant-Fireworker,\r\none Sergeant, one Corporal, four bombardiers, twelve gunners, and\r\nthirty-two matrosses per company, reducing the total from 107 to 57, a\r\nfifer having been added to each. The supernumerary fireworkers were put\r\non half-pay, and brought in as vacancies occurred,—the last being\r\nabsorbed in 1767.\r\n\r\nFrom 1763 to 1771 was a singularly uneventful period in the history of\r\nthe Regiment. One Battalion was quartered in America, its head-quarters\r\nbeing at Woolwich; the companies of another were divided between\r\nGibraltar and Minorca, and the third was in Great Britain. The companies\r\nin the East Indies remained as before until 1765. A relief of the 2nd by\r\nthe 1st Battalion took place towards the end of this time; and the\r\ncompanies at home were periodically relieved as at present. One\r\npeculiarity, however, existed then, which does so no longer. When two or\r\nmore companies were required from Woolwich for out-stations at home, the\r\nCaptains were ordered to meet at the Commandant's office, and draw lots\r\nfor their destinations. As a means of silencing grumblers, it was\r\ncertainly advantageous.\r\n\r\nAlthough England was at peace, other countries had their troubles; and\r\nPortugal, being in distress as regarded her Artillery, applied during\r\nthis time for the services of Captain Macbean, who had served her so\r\nwell before, and various other officers of the Regiment. The request was\r\ngranted: the officers being made supernumerary, their promotion going\r\non, but their pay coming from the Portuguese Government. Captain Macbean\r\nreached the highest rank in the Portuguese service, and all the others\r\nreceived the strongest commendations.—One—Captain-Lieutenant Yorke—died\r\nin Portugal: the same officer, who, as a subaltern, with a handful of\r\nmen, managed to get a gun up the heights above Quebec, when Wolfe made\r\nhis famous and successful attack.\r\n\r\nThis was not the first instance of a Foreign Government paying the\r\ncompliment to the Royal Artillery of asking assistance from its ranks.\r\nIn 1744, the King of Sardinia asked and obtained the services of five\r\nofficers and twenty-four men of the Royal Artillery, who were on board\r\nthe bomb-vessels in the Mediterranean; and they served with distinction\r\nin his Army until taken prisoners at the capture of Montalban and\r\nMontleuze.\r\n\r\nSome changes in the dress of the officers were made during this time. In\r\n1768 white waistcoats, instead of scarlet, and white breeches were\r\nadopted both for officers and men. In 1770, swords were substituted for\r\nthe fusees which had hitherto been the arms of the officers, and the\r\nsame sword exercise was adopted as was in use among dragoons. At the\r\nsame time, the Regiment adopted the German mode of wearing the sash\r\nround the waist, instead of over the right shoulder, as hitherto.\r\nEpaulettes were also substituted for laced shoulder-knots. The non-\r\ncommissioned officers and men wore their hair plaited, and turned up\r\nbehind with a black ribbon or tape, three quarters of a yard long, in a\r\n_bow_-knot where tied; and if any men were debarred by nature or\r\naccident from wearing their hair sufficiently long, they were compelled\r\nto wear a false plait—anticipating by a century the present custom of\r\nthe other sex.\r\n\r\nThe letter-books of this time are chiefly devoted to correspondence on\r\nmatters connected with clothing, promotion and reliefs. On the first\r\nnamed subject, the correspondence with Major James, who commanded at New\r\nYork, is particularly voluminous.\r\n\r\nPromotion was slow; and when accelerated by retirement of officers, the\r\nsystem pursued was peculiar. For example, it was decided to remove\r\nCaptain-Lieutenant Rogers to the half-pay list. His half-pay,—six\r\nshillings per diem, was to be augmented by two shillings from the Board\r\nof Ordnance; but—by an ingenious arrangement, whereby the Lieutenant,\r\nSecond Lieutenant, and Lieutenant-Fireworker, who got promotion, were\r\nmade to remain on their old rate of pay, six shillings and fourpence per\r\ndiem was saved towards Captain Rogers' half-pay, and the Board had only\r\nto find the daily sum of one shilling and eightpence. At this time, in\r\nthe year 1765, the Board placed the responsibility of the men's clothing\r\non the Colonels of Battalions, declining any further interference. The\r\nwisdom of the change—except in so far as it saved trouble to the\r\nHonourable Board—was questionable; for some Colonels took a very liberal\r\nview of their discretion and power in the matter, going so far even as\r\nto alter the _colour_ as well as the shape of the various articles of\r\ntheir men's uniform.\r\n\r\nAn excellent and hospitable officer, General Williamson, now commanded\r\nat Woolwich; and one of his invitations to his friends is so quaint as\r\nto be worthy of reproduction:—\"July 25th, 1767. The gentlemen of twenty\r\nyears' acquaintance are desired to meet General Williamson, and dine at\r\n'The Bull' on Shooter's Hill, on Monday next, 1st August, their names to\r\nbe sent to Dr. Irwin. Dinner on table at three o'clock.\" The General had\r\na son in the Regiment, at this time in New York, who was as great a\r\nfavourite as his father.\r\n\r\nThis time of peace was beneficial to the Royal Military Academy. More\r\ntime was devoted to the curriculum, and inducements to proficiency held\r\nout successfully to the cadets. The King and Queen paid a visit to the\r\nAcademy, among the other lions of Woolwich. It was on this occasion that\r\n\"their Majesties saw many curious firings; among the rest a large iron\r\ncannon, fired by a lock like a common gun; a heavy 12-pounder, fired 23\r\ntimes in a minute, and spunged every time by a new and wonderful\r\ncontrivance, said to be the invention of Dr. Desaguliers, with other\r\nastonishing improvements of the like kind.\"[24] In 1765, a most formal\r\nexamination of the cadets had taken place in presence of the Master-\r\nGeneral and principal officers of the Ordnance, and many other important\r\nofficials, including the President of the Royal Society, who expressed\r\ntheir satisfaction with the \"noble institution,\" and distributed gold\r\nand silver medals to the most distinguished cadets. In a hundred years,\r\none who had been himself a cadet at the Royal Military Academy, and for\r\nmany years an honoured officer in the Royal Artillery, Sir Edward\r\nSabine, would occupy the chair filled by one of the visitors on that\r\nday, and be one of the most popular Presidents of the Royal Society.\r\n\r\nThe names of the following officers appear during this peaceful time, as\r\nin command of companies:—Captains Foy, Drummond, and Stehelin, at\r\nMinorca; Torriano, Innes, and Butler, at Gibraltar; Jeffery, Phillips,\r\nSmith, Carter, and Howdell, at Woolwich. In America, we trace companies\r\ncommanded at different times by Captains Martin, Williams, Farrington,\r\nHay, Ferguson, Webdall, Lewis, Dover, Walton, Winter, Carlisle, and\r\nGillespie. The stations on that continent which were the head-quarters\r\nof the companies included New York, Pensacola, Quebec, Halifax,\r\nPittsburg (Louisbourg), Montreal, and Placentia in Newfoundland. There\r\nwere also detachments at Boston, Crown Point, Fort Ontario, and Niagara.\r\n\r\nAn amusing narrative of the service of a bombardier and two matrosses\r\nwho were permitted to accept employment from the Emperor of Morocco may\r\nprove an interesting conclusion to this short chapter. It is based upon\r\na manuscript in the Royal Artillery Library, framed by the bombardier\r\nhimself, one John Turner by name, who had been called upon to make a\r\nreport of his doings during his absence, and who certainly even on his\r\nown showing had a keen eye to the main chance. The ineffable conceit of\r\nthe man, his firm impression that Emperors and Princes only existed to\r\ngive him his daily pay and rations, and his exalted notion of his\r\nposition as a bombardier in the Royal Artillery, can only be realized by\r\na complete perusal of the manuscript. But even if curtailed, the\r\nnarrative cannot fail to amuse.\r\n\r\nJohn Turner was quartered at Gibraltar. He was a fair scholar, had a\r\ngood opinion of himself, and was a bombardier. In the summer of 1769,\r\nthe Emperor of Morocco sent a request to the Governor of Gibraltar for\r\nan Artilleryman to explain certain matters in gunnery, and to act as a\r\ntutor in the military art to the young Prince, his son. In 1872, it is\r\nprobable that for such an appointment candidates would be innumerable,\r\nand would embrace even General Officers among their numbers. Possibly in\r\nGibraltar, the Emperor was not very highly esteemed; be that, however,\r\nas it may, Bombardier John Turner was selected. He was to receive\r\nthirty-five dollars per month, besides certain other advantages, and\r\nthis fact was very present to his mind during his absence. At first, a\r\ncircumstance which occurred vexed John Turner's soul sorely: the wind\r\nhaving detained him some days, the Governor was relieved by one who\r\nwould not assume the responsibility of letting him go, without an order\r\nfrom England. Until November the honest man was kept fretting and\r\npining, but in the end he was rewarded not merely by the permission to\r\ngo himself, but by an order to take with him two matrosses, who greatly\r\nswelled his importance. On the 3rd of December, he and his comrades\r\nlanded about six miles from Tetuan, whither they were conveyed on mules\r\nand lodged in a house where they were treated \"beyond their\r\nexpectation.\" It was but seldom that in this respect John Turner's\r\nexpectations were exceeded. He had a letter to the Governor, which he\r\ninsisted on presenting; and with much presence of mind, on the morning\r\nafter his arrival, he demanded an advance of money for himself and\r\ncomrades. This was granted; but, as he plaintively wrote, it was made\r\nthe subject of much misrepresentation, and he was reprimanded by his\r\nsuperiors in Gibraltar, on the story reaching them. The fact was, he\r\ninnocently said, that he had borrowed some money on his note of hand in\r\nGibraltar, \"to clear some little obligations under which we lay,\" and\r\nthe note met him at Tetuan, where he was led to believe he would be put\r\nin funds to pay it. On the 17th, the party left in great state \"with an\r\nAlcayde and three horsemen for our guard, hired horses to ride on, and\r\nmules to carry our baggage and camp equipage.\" They encamped every night\r\nnear some village, and the inhabitants were compelled to bring them\r\nfood, and find sentinels for their baggage, under pain of being taken as\r\nrebels to the Emperor, for which purpose chains were carried by the\r\nescort. The good bombardier describes in his report at some length the\r\nnature of the food, some of which he was pleased to consider very good\r\neating. At last they reached the place where the young Prince was\r\nencamped, and from that moment John Turner became an old man of the sea\r\nto that unhappy youth, and when he had any complaint to make would go\r\nnowhere but to head-quarters. His early interviews with the Prince, and\r\nevery word that passed between them are duly chronicled. He accompanied\r\nhim to Mequinez, and immediately sought the Emperor's Secretary, to whom\r\nhe had letters. The frank manners of that official at first charmed\r\nJohn; but he soon found him to be but \"a master of the French address,\r\njoined to all the villainies of the Court of Morocco, and a Jew in the\r\nvery essence of the word.\" In a few days he had an interview with the\r\nEmperor himself, who in the course of conversation asked to see his\r\ninstruments. It may interest the modern Artilleryman to know what a\r\nbombardier's instruments were in the year 1770. Those which John\r\nproduced were his \"quadrant, perpendicular, and Gunter's scales,\r\ntogether with a case of mathematical instruments.\"\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate bombardier never saw his instruments after he once let\r\nthem into the young Prince's hands, and this called forth very severe\r\nstrictures from him on princely nature. \"Plundering,\" he writes, \"is\r\nwhat these Princes are taught from their infancy.\"\r\n\r\nThe Emperor having expressed a wish to see the three Artillerymen throw\r\na shell, they complied. The mortar was of a different calibre from any\r\nthey had ever seen, nor did they know anything about the range;\r\nfortunately, however, they made a good guess, and the Emperor was much\r\npleased with the practice. He ordered them a daily supply of provisions,\r\n\"which order, however, was never complied with but in part.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this moment John's domestic troubles were very great. While he had\r\nenough meat he never abused it; but when his allowance was cut short, he\r\ndescribed it as \"carrion meat.\" He was quartered in a Jew's house, and\r\nthe Jew plundered him sorely, depriving him of the best part of his\r\nprovisions. He said little, but thought a good deal; and receiving no\r\nsatisfaction from the Imperial Secretary, demanded to see the Prince,\r\nwho came to him immediately. \"I acquainted him how ill we were treated\r\nwith regard to provisions, and as our money was all gone begged of His\r\nRoyal Highness to take some method that we might be better supplied. He\r\nasked whose fault it was. I answered, 'The Chief of the Jews.' He\r\nordered our interpreter to go and tell him that if he did not find us\r\neverything, as his father had ordered, he would cut off his head, and\r\nburn his body; and desired, whenever we found him in the least\r\ndeficient, to call a guard of Moors, and bring the Chief of the Jews to\r\nhim, and we should see him executed. He then dismissed us, and we went\r\nhome, and almost as soon as we went there one of the Prince's black\r\nservants came with the Chief of the Jews, and a halter about his neck,\r\nand told us by the interpreter that he was ordered to bring him there,\r\nand give him fifty bastinados in our presence, which he did,\r\nnotwithstanding we offered to buy off the punishment with six ounces.\"\r\n\r\nThe climax of John Turner's narrative is when he describes a day's shell\r\npractice with the Prince in presence of the Emperor, when the powder of\r\nthe country, of whose strength John was ignorant, was used. The young\r\nPrince made good practice with it, but as he would not impart the secret\r\nof its strength, the Artillerymen made very indifferent shooting. His\r\nMajesty remonstrated, making invidious comparisons, which roused John\r\nTurner into reminding the Emperor with due deference that he came there\r\nto instruct His Majesty's subjects in the _English_ method of practice,\r\nnot to be instructed by the Prince—he being master of his business\r\nbefore he came there.\r\n\r\nAnother day's practice followed: The Prince hit the mark with one of his\r\nshells, the bombardier did not. It was a painful circumstance; but the\r\nconceit of John Turner did not fail him. He first blamed the powder, and\r\nthen asserted that, notwithstanding his failure to hit the mark, his\r\ngeneral practice was infinitely superior to that of his Royal pupil. And\r\nhe submitted a chart of the day's shooting in support of his statement.\r\n\r\nIt is but fair to say that Bombardier Turner was most conscientious in\r\nperforming another duty which was enjoined upon him, the construction of\r\na small laboratory. He writes with the greatest scorn of the native\r\nartificers, but he succeeded in making them do what he wished. Just,\r\nhowever, as he had overcome the main difficulties, his peace of mind was\r\ndisturbed by his two chronic wants, lack of money and scarcity of\r\nprovisions. This time he resolved to write to the Emperor himself; and\r\nendeavoured to get some one to translate his remonstrances into Arabic\r\nwith that view. He failed, however, and had to content himself with the\r\nPrince, whose life, by means of his interpreter, he was able to make a\r\nburden to him.\r\n\r\nThe reader of his report is not surprised to find that after a very\r\nshort time his services were dispensed with, and he was directed to\r\nreturn to Gibraltar. A man who insists on afflicting royalty with the\r\nmost trivial complaints becomes a very unwelcome inmate of a despotic\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\nSo John and his comrades started, grumbling to the last, and his conceit\r\nand self-importance manifesting themselves at every stage of the\r\njourney. Carefully mentioning that he was still allowed an Imperial\r\nescort, he points out another instance of shabby treatment to which he\r\nwas exposed. It should be mentioned that when the horses requisite for\r\nhis comfort were not forthcoming, the gallant bombardier always declined\r\nto move. On one evening he was informed that the requisite cattle would\r\nbe ready next morning. \"Our things being ready by the time,\" he writes,\r\n\"I went to see the cattle that was prepared for us. I found only four\r\nmules barely sufficient to carry our baggage. I enquired where I and the\r\ntwo men were to ride, and was informed—on the top of the baggage. I said\r\nthat since I had been in the country I was never asked to travel in this\r\nmanner; neither did I think His Majesty would be pleased if he knew how\r\nwe were treated; and, moreover, not any of _my_ baggage should be moved\r\nuntil three saddle-horses should be brought for me and my companions. He\r\nsaid, as for me, I might ride on one of his horses, but I absolutely\r\nrefused, adding it was equally my duty to take care of those men as of\r\nmyself, and until I saw cattle enough to carry us and our baggage, I\r\nwould not stir from the place, unless it was to return and acquaint the\r\nEmperor of our usage.\"\r\n\r\nIt is sufficient to say that on this, as on every similar occasion, the\r\nbombardier carried his point.\r\n\r\nThe day arrived when they were to take ship from Tetuan to Gibraltar. To\r\nthe very last his pecuniary difficulties haunted him. They were directed\r\nto attend at a notary's office to receive their pay. A sum far inferior\r\nto what he considered his due was offered him. \"I informed them,\" he\r\nwrites, \"that that was not near the sum that was due to us; but was\r\ngiven to understand that if I did not accept that, I might possibly get\r\nnone; and rather than run that hazard, as I knew them capable of any\r\nmeanness, I took what was offered, and gave a receipt in part payment.\r\nWe were likewise out of this short payment obliged to pay our\r\ninterpreter; but this I did with less reluctance, as I had been informed\r\nby Mr. Rodway, Master-Wheeler, of Gibraltar, that whenever he went to\r\nMequinez by order of Government, he always paid his interpreter himself,\r\nbut that the money was always returned to him at Gibraltar.\" The\r\nexquisite delicacy of the hint at repayment, embodied in an official\r\nreport, cannot be surpassed.\r\n\r\nIn days long after John Turner's career was finished, the spectacle has\r\nbeen witnessed of an invaded country straining every nerve, and\r\npractising every self-denial, to procure the withdrawal from its\r\noccupied districts of the enemy's troops. It is questionable, however,\r\nwhether its eagerness was equal to that which must have been felt on all\r\nsides when that memorable event occurred which it has been attempted to\r\ndescribe,—the invasion of Morocco by a bombardier.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1770, the Regiment suffered from two evils: one, the chronic\r\nslowness of promotion which has always afflicted it; the other, an\r\ninability to carry out the foreign reliefs with so small a number of\r\ncompanies at home. To meet these evils a remedy was devised, which shall\r\nbe treated in the next chapter—the formation of another Battalion.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 24:\r\n\r\n  Cleaveland's MSS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIII.\r\n             THE FOURTH BATTALION.—THE HISTORY AND PRESENT\r\n                     DESIGNATION OF THE COMPANIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS Battalion was formed on the 1st January, 1771, by drafting six\r\ncompanies from the Battalions already in existence, which were thus\r\nreduced from ten to eight companies, and by the formation, in addition,\r\nof two new companies. At the same date, eight companies of invalids were\r\nformed from the men on out-pension, two of which were attached to each\r\nBattalion, but were not borne upon the effective strength. These eight\r\ncompanies were consolidated in 1779 in one invalid battalion, with a\r\nregular staff, and effective companies were raised for the other\r\nbattalions, in their stead.\r\n\r\nOn its first formation, the companies of the 4th Battalion were very\r\nweak, consisting each of 1 Captain, 1 Captain-Lieutenant, 2 First\r\nLieutenants, 2 Second Lieutenants, 2 Sergeants, 2 Corporals, 4\r\nbombardiers, 8 gunners, 52 matrosses, and 2 drummers. The staff of the\r\nBattalion consisted of a Colonel-Commandant, a Lieutenant-Colonel, a\r\nMajor, an Adjutant, a Quartermaster, and a Chaplain. Colonel Ord, the\r\nfirst Colonel-Commandant, had greatly distinguished himself in North\r\nAmerica in 1759 and 1760; and it was a happy coincidence that he should\r\nreceive the command of a battalion whose services in that country were\r\ndestined to be so brilliant. These services will receive more\r\nappropriate mention in the chapters connected with the American War of\r\nIndependence, and with the gallant officer who commanded it during that\r\nwar, General James Pattison.\r\n\r\nBut two of the companies received special marks of distinction which\r\ndeserve to be mentioned. One, No. 1 Company, now No. 4 Battery, 7th\r\nBrigade, was singled out after the battle of Vaux, in 1794, for its\r\ngallant conduct during the day, and the whole Army was formed up to see\r\nit march past the Duke on the field of battle. Another company, No. 10,\r\nreceived a special mark of distinction for its gallantry during the\r\nsecond American War, and more especially at the capture of Fort Niagara.\r\nBy General Order of 7th October, 1816, it was permitted to wear on its\r\nappointments \"in addition to any badges or devices which may have been\r\nhitherto granted to the Royal Regiment of Artillery\" the word \"Niagara.\"\r\nThis company subsequently fell a victim to change and reduction. It was\r\nreduced in January, 1819, after a service of forty years, having been\r\none of the two companies formed in 1779 to replace the invalid companies\r\nof the Battalion. It was reformed at Woolwich on the 16th August, 1848;\r\nand on the 3rd November in that year it became No. 6 Company of the 12th\r\nBattalion. In 1859, when the Brigade system was introduced, it became\r\nNo. 9 Battery of the 6th Brigade; on the 1st April, 1865, it was\r\ntransferred to the 12th Brigade as No. 8 Battery; and on the 1st\r\nFebruary, 1871, by reduction, it ceased to exist as such. It is a matter\r\nof regret that the pruning-knife should be applied to the companies\r\nwhich have a distinctive history.\r\n\r\nThe 4th Battalion afforded a precedent—although not a happy one—for the\r\nBrigade system as applied to the Royal Artillery. It was the only\r\nbattalion which ever went on service with its head-quarter staff.\r\nExperience soon proved that it would have been better to leave that\r\nappendage—as was customary—at Woolwich. The Battalion letter-books teem\r\nwith complaints as to clothing, recruiting, and pay, which might have\r\nbeen obviated by having at home the usual battalion officials, whose\r\nduties were connected with these details. With the companies detached\r\nover the American continent, and the head-quarters virtually imprisoned\r\nin New York, the confusion was endless, and the natural results excite a\r\nsmile as the student reads of them. For the officials at the Board of\r\nOrdnance exercised the same paternal interference over the distant\r\nstaff, as if they had been in Woolwich. The time occupied by\r\ncorrespondence across the Atlantic, rendered necessary by the stupidity\r\nand the curiosity of the Ordnance officials, told heavily against the\r\ncomfort of the companies, and the peace of mind of their Captains. The\r\ncircumlocution between London and New York, New York and all the\r\nstations on the continent where detachments of the Battalion were\r\nstationed, and back again to the Tower, was at once ludicrous and\r\nirritating. And the trouble caused by the absence from England of those\r\nwho would have interested themselves in procuring suitable and\r\ncreditable recruits cannot be realized save by those who have waded\r\nthrough the letter-books of the period. The companies were fettered to a\r\nbeleaguered head-quarters, which in its turn was tied and bound to a\r\ndistant department, nor was allowed the slightest independence of\r\naction. The result may easily be imagined. Questions which could have\r\nbeen decided in a few minutes, if those interested could have met, grew\r\nevery day more complicated and unwieldy by the correspondence at long\r\nand uncertain intervals in which the Board of Ordnance revelled.\r\n\r\nThe services of the companies will now be given, in the same manner as\r\nthose of the other battalions. There are few lists more noble than that\r\nof the military operations in which No. 1 Company was engaged. The\r\nbattery—No. 4 of the 7th Brigade—whose history this is, may well be\r\nproud of such noble antecedents. The revival of these may prove a means\r\nof awakening a pride in its ranks which will be the strongest aid to\r\ndiscipline, the most powerful incentive to progress.\r\n\r\nThe succession of Captains of the various companies, as far as the\r\nsomewhat mutilated records on this point will admit, will also be given,\r\ndown to the time when the nomenclature of the companies was changed,\r\nsince which date, so recent, no difficulty will be found in continuing\r\nthe lists.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     No. 1 COMPANY, 4th BATTALION,\r\n                     Now \"4\" BATTERY, 7th BRIGADE.\r\n\r\n ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n Battles, Sieges, and other Military operations in which this Company\r\n   has been engaged.\r\n ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n 1775       Battle of Bunker's Hill.\r\n 1776       Siege of Boston.\r\n 1776       Battle of Brooklyn, and capture of Horan's Hook.\r\n 1776       Occupation of New York.\r\n 1776       Battle of White Plains.\r\n 1776       Capture of Fort Washington and Fort Lee.\r\n 1776       Expedition against Charleston.\r\n 1777       Operations in the Jerseys under Lord Cornwallis.\r\n 1777       Affair of Westfield: defeat of Americans.\r\n 1777       Battle of Brandywine: ditto.\r\n 1777       Occupation of Philadelphia.\r\n 1777       Battle of Freehold Court: defeat of Americans.\r\n 1777       Capture of Savannah, and defeat of American General Howe—\r\n              detachments only present.\r\n 1779       Capture of Stoney Point on the Hudson.\r\n 1779       General Matthews' successful raid in Virginia.\r\n 1780       Capture of Charlestown, and operations in North Carolina.\r\n 1781       Detachments were present at Yorktown when Lord Cornwallis\r\n              capitulated.\r\n 1793       Expedition to the Netherlands under H.

It was the stillness which precedes a storm.\r\n\r\nIn 1775, the Titanic contest commenced, in which England found herself\r\npitted against France, Spain, and her own children.\r\n\r\nFrom that year, until 1783, the student of her military history finds\r\nhis labour incessant. America and Europe alike claim his attention; the\r\nWar of Independence, and the Sieges of Gibraltar and Port Mahon, furnish\r\na wealth of material for his examination.\r\n\r\nBut before entering on these, the ground must be cleared and the\r\nregimental gossip between 1771 and 1775 must be chronicled.\r\n\r\nDuring that time, the relief of the battalion serving in America—by the\r\n4th—took place, and on the latter fell all Artillery duties performed at\r\nthe commencement of hostilities in that country. As the war developed,\r\nthe 4th Battalion was reinforced by four companies of the 3rd, whose\r\nmen—and also the Lieutenant-Fireworkers—were gradually absorbed into the\r\n4th Battalion. At the same time, four companies of the 1st and 3rd\r\nBattalions, under the gallant Phillips, were ordered to America, and\r\nformed part of the force commanded by the ill-fated Burgoyne. During\r\nthis decade, between 1770 and 1779, five companies of the 2nd Battalion\r\nrelieved those at Gibraltar, and were the only Artillery present at that\r\nmemorable siege, which sheds a lustre over this unhappy period in the\r\nnational history.\r\n\r\nWoolwich saw a good many changes at this time. The barracks in the\r\nWarren were inadequate to meet the wants of the Regiment, now that it\r\nhad received so many augmentations. Some ground on the Common was,\r\ntherefore, purchased by the Board, and the foundation laid of barracks,\r\nlarge enough to accommodate a battalion of eight companies. The building\r\nwas completed, and the barracks inhabited, early in 1776.\r\n\r\nModifications in the dress of the Regiment took place; and the evil\r\nresults of the liberty granted to the Colonels of Battalions with regard\r\nto their men's clothing manifested themselves to such a degree, that in\r\nMarch, 1772, an order was issued, forbidding any alteration in the\r\nclothing of the men, or uniform of the officers, without the previous\r\nknowledge and approbation of the Master-General.\r\n\r\nFrom various Battalion Orders issued at this time, we learn that the\r\nofficers had now to provide themselves with plain frocks, and plain hats\r\nwith a gold band, button, and loop; and that the accoutrements of the\r\nmen, which had hitherto been buff, were now changed,—becoming what they\r\nare at present—white. The dress for a parade under arms was as follows:—\r\nThe men, in white breeches, white stockings, black half-spatterdashes,\r\nand their hair clubbed:—the officers, in plain frocks, half-\r\nspatterdashes, and queues, with white cotton or thread stockings under\r\ntheir spatterdashes, and gold button and loop on their plain hats. When\r\nthe officers were on duty, they were ordered to wear their hair clubbed,\r\nand their hats cocked in the same manner as those of the men. The hats\r\nof the men were worn with the front loops just over the nose. Black\r\nstocks were utterly forbidden, white only being permitted to be worn,\r\neither by officers or men.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd June, 1772, a Royal Warrant was issued, deciding that\r\nCaptain-Lieutenants in the Artillery and Engineers should rank as\r\nCaptains in the Army. Those who were then serving, were to have their\r\ncommissions as Captain, dated 26th May, 1772; and those who might be\r\nsubsequently commissioned, from the date of their appointment. The title\r\nof Captain-Lieutenant was abolished, and that of Second Captain\r\nsubstituted, in 1804.\r\n\r\nIn 1772 and 1775, the regiment was reviewed by the King—on both\r\noccasions at Blackheath. The inspections were very satisfactory; in\r\n1772, \"The corps went through their different evolutions with great\r\nexactness, though greatly incommoded by the weather, and obstructed by\r\nthe prodigious concourse of people, which was greater than ever was\r\nknown on any like occasion.\" In addition to these reviews, the King\r\nvisited Woolwich in state in 1773, for the purpose of inspecting the new\r\nfoundry and boring-room. In the latter, he saw a 42-pounder bored with a\r\nnew and wonderful horizontal boring-machine. He saw many curious\r\ninventions; among others, a light field-piece, invented by Colonel\r\nPattison, \"which, on emergencies, might be carried on men's shoulders,\"\r\nand which was tried, \"to the great amazement of His Majesty.\" He also\r\nwent to the Academy, where he breakfasted; and then inspected the\r\ncompanies which happened to be in Woolwich, with whose manœuvres he\r\nexpressed the utmost satisfaction. The review was marred by an accident\r\nwhich occurred. \"Colonel Broome, in parading in front of the Regiment,\r\nbefore His Majesty, on a very beautiful and well-broke horse, but very\r\ntender-mouthed, checked him, which made the horse rise upon his hind-\r\nlegs, and fall backwards upon his rider, who is so greatly bruised, that\r\nhis life is despaired of.\"[26]\r\n\r\nIn 1772, the officers, whose extra pay on promotion had been taken to\r\nmake up the half-pay of Captain-Lieutenant Rogers, complained of the\r\ninjustice, and their remonstrances were attended to. A warrant was\r\nissued on the 4th August, 1772, directing a vacancy of one Second\r\nLieutenant to be kept open in one of the invalid companies, the pay to\r\nbe employed towards Captain Rogers's half-pay.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to stigmatize too harshly the system of non-effectives,\r\nborne for various purposes on the strength of the Regiment, in which the\r\nBoard of Ordnance delighted. It was at once deceitful and\r\nunbusinesslike. If the purposes were legitimate, they should have formed\r\nthe subject of a separate vote. At the risk of wearying the reader, a\r\nrecapitulation will be given of the non-effectives in the Regiment at\r\nthis time, and the purposes for which they were borne upon the\r\nestablishment. There were thirty-two marching companies in the Regiment,\r\nand eight of invalids. On the muster-roll of each company, a dummy—so to\r\nspeak—was borne, whose pay went to the Widows' Fund; another per\r\ncompany, for what was called the Non-effective Fund, and a third, whose\r\npay went to remunerate the fifer. In addition to this, ten dummies were\r\nborne, whose pay went to swell General Belford's income, in the form of\r\ncommand pay; and nine were utilized for the band.\r\n\r\nIn short, out of 1088 matrosses, shown as the establishment of the\r\nmarching companies, no less than 115 had no existence; and in the\r\ninvalid companies, a Second Lieutenant and 16 matrosses were equally\r\nshadowy. If we examine the purposes for which the fund called the non-\r\neffective fund existed, shall we find them to be irregular, or such as\r\ncould not be made public? Not at all; the charges on this fund were\r\nlegitimate, and a separate vote might and should have been taken,\r\nparticularizing them. They were to meet the expenses connected with\r\nrecruits, deserters, and discharged invalids, as well as certain\r\ncontingent charges, connected with the command of companies. Why then\r\nthe mystery, and deceit practised upon the public? If the senior officer\r\nof Artillery was deserving of higher pay on account of his services or\r\nresponsibility, why not openly say so, instead of showing to the\r\ncountry, as part of the Artillery establishment, ten men who had no\r\nexistence? The wickedness and folly of such a means of keeping accounts\r\ncould only have emanated from such a Department as the Board of\r\nOrdnance.\r\n\r\nMention has been made of recruiting expenses. Certain regulations which\r\nwere in force at this time may be interesting to the reader. Levy money\r\nwas not allowed to the recruiting officer in cases where the recruits\r\nwere not approved by the commanding officer, but their subsistence after\r\nenlistment until rejection, was admitted. If a recruit deserted before\r\njoining, no charge whatever was admitted against the fund. But if he\r\ndied between enlistment and the time when he should have joined, all\r\nexpenses connected with him were admitted on production of the necessary\r\nvouchers and certificates. When the non-effective fund was balanced,\r\nwhich was done annually on the 30th June, 5_l._ was credited to the\r\naccounts of the coming year, for each man wanting to complete the\r\nestablishment, in order to meet the expenses of the recruits who would\r\nbe enlisted to fill the vacancies.\r\n\r\nA word, now, about the invalids. They were for service in the garrisons;\r\nat first, merely in Great Britain, but ultimately also abroad, for in\r\n1775, when the war in Massachusetts was assuming considerable\r\nproportions, the company of the 4th Battalion, which was quartered in\r\nNewfoundland, was ordered to Boston; and the two companies of invalids,\r\nshown as belonging to that battalion, and then quartered at Portsmouth,\r\nwere ordered to Newfoundland for duty. Men over twenty years' service\r\nwere drafted from the marching to the invalid companies, instead of\r\nbeing discharged with a pension; and the companies were officered from\r\nthe regiment, appointments in the various ranks being given to the\r\nsenior applicants.\r\n\r\nIn 1779, two additional invalid companies were added, and the ten were\r\nconsolidated into one battalion, effective companies being given to the\r\nother battalions in their room.\r\n\r\nThe staff of the Invalid Battalion consisted of a Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nCommandant, a Major, and an Adjutant; and the establishment of each\r\ncompany was as follows:—a Captain, a First and Second Lieutenant, 1\r\nSergeant, 1 Corporal, 1 Drummer, 3 Bombardiers, 6 Gunners, and 36\r\nMatrosses. Although this battalion was fifth in order of formation, and\r\nwas frequently called the Fifth Battalion,—the real Fifth Battalion, the\r\nservices of which are sketched in the end of this volume, was not formed\r\nuntil much nearer the close of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nIn 1772, a Military Society was founded at Woolwich for the discussion\r\nof professional questions. It was originated by two officers at\r\nGibraltar—Jardine and Williams—extracts from whose letters to one\r\nanother, when the idea occurred to them, are quaintly amusing.\r\nLieutenant Jardine writes:—\"I have been thinking that there must be a\r\ngood deal of knowledge scattered about in this numerous corps. Could it\r\nnot be collected, concentrated, and turned to some effect? We have\r\nalready in this country all kinds of Societies, except Military ones. I\r\nthink a voluntary association might be formed among us (admitting,\r\nperhaps, Engineers and others) on liberal principles, viz., for their\r\nown improvement and amusement, where military, mathematical, and\r\nphilosophical knowledge, being the chief object of their enquiries,\r\nessays, &c., might thus be improved and propagated. They might thus\r\ncommunicate and increase their own ideas, preserve themselves from\r\nvulgar errors, and keeping one another in countenance, bear up against\r\nthe contempt of pert and presumptive ignorance. If it increased in\r\nnumbers, and grew into consequence, they might in time bring study and\r\nreal knowledge into fashion, and, retorting a juster contempt, keep\r\nmediocrity, and false or no merit, down to their proper sphere.\"\r\n\r\nHis correspondent, who was then on board a transport, and wrote under\r\ndifficulties, eagerly entered into the scheme, but for reasons stated\r\ncould not go into details. \"I have many things,\" he writes, \"in my head,\r\nbut our band (consisting of geese screaming, ducks quacking, hogs\r\ngrunting, dogs growling, puppies barking, brats squalling, and all hands\r\nbawling) are now performing a full piece, so that whatever my\r\npericranium labours with, it must lie concealed until I arrive at\r\nRetirement's Lying-in Hospital, in Solitude Row, where I shall hope for\r\na happy delivery.\"\r\n\r\nThe friends reached Woolwich that year; and in October the society was\r\nformed. There happened to be many among the senior officers who\r\nsympathized with the promoters, notably Generals Williamson and\r\nDesaguliers, and Colonels Pattison and Phillips. The meetings took place\r\nat 6 P.M. on every Saturday preceding the full moon; and were secret, in\r\norder that an inventor might communicate his discoveries without fear of\r\ntheir appropriation. With the author's consent, however, papers might be\r\npublished. The carrying-on of experiments was one of the main purposes\r\nwhich animated the society. At the present day, when the idea which\r\nanimated the promoters of the old society has blossomed into a Literary\r\nand Scientific Institution, unparalleled in any corps in any land, which\r\nnot merely encourages and developes the intelligence and literary talent\r\nof its members, but aids, in the highest degree, to lift the corps out\r\nof mediocrity into science,—these old facts connected with the infant\r\nsociety have a peculiar interest. The year 1872 may look back to 1772\r\nwith filial regard.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th July, 1773, the 4th Battalion arrived in New York—with the\r\nexception of one company, which went to Newfoundland.\r\n\r\nWithin a very brief period, the political atmosphere in that country\r\nbecame hopelessly overcast, and with the outbreak of the storm at\r\nBoston, in 1775, commences at once the active history of the American\r\nWar, and of the Royal Artillery during that war, which is to be treated\r\nby itself. But parallel with that long and disastrous campaign, and\r\noccupying a period extending from 1779 to 1783, was the great siege of\r\nGibraltar. To prevent an interruption in the thread of the American\r\nnarrative, it is proposed to anticipate matters, and passing over the\r\nyears 1775 to 1778, when the eye of the student can see nothing but\r\nAmerica, proceed at once to the consideration of the siege, and then\r\nreturn to an uninterrupted consideration of the Artillery share in the\r\nAmerican War from 1775 to the Peace of 1783.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 26:\r\n\r\n  Colonel Cleaveland's MSS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXV.\r\n                     THE GREAT SIEGE OF GIBRALTAR.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Neither, while the war lasts, will Gibraltar surrender. Not though\r\n  Crillon, Nassau, Siegen, with the ablest projectors extant, are\r\n  there; and Prince Condé and Prince d'Artois have hastened to help.\r\n  Wondrous leather-roofed floating-batteries, set afloat by French-\r\n  Spanish _Pacte de famille_, give gallant summons; to which,\r\n  nevertheless, Gibraltar answers Plutonically, with mere torrents of\r\n  red-hot iron,—as if stone Calpe had become a throat of the Pit; and\r\n  utters such a Doom's-blast of a No, as all men must credit.\"—\r\n  CARLYLE.\r\n\r\nTHE year 1779 saw England engaged in war on both sides of the Atlantic,\r\nwith bitter and jealous enemies. Her struggle with the revolted colonies\r\noffered a tempting opportunity to France to wipe out her losses during\r\nthe Seven Years' War,—and to Spain, to wipe out the disgrace which she\r\nfelt in the possession of Gibraltar by the English. France, accordingly,\r\nespoused the cause of the Americans; and Spain, under pretence of the\r\nrejection of an offer of mediation between England and France, proposed\r\nin terms which could not be accepted, immediately declared a war, which\r\nhad been decided upon from the day of the disaster at Saratoga, and for\r\nwhich preparations had been progressing for some time without any\r\npretence of concealment.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Artillery in this year consisted of thirty-two _service_\r\ncompanies, and eight _invalid_. The augmentation referred to in the last\r\nchapter did not take place until the end of the year. Of this number,\r\none-half—sixteen companies—was in America; one company in Newfoundland;\r\nthree in the West Indies; three in Minorca; and five in Gibraltar:—a\r\ntotal abroad of twenty-eight service companies out of thirty-two. Nor\r\nwas it a foreign service, so weary and uneventful as it sometimes is\r\nnow: it was a time when England was fighting almost for existence, and\r\nevery company had to share the dangers. Should such a rising against\r\nEngland ever occur again, the Regiment could not select as its model for\r\nimitation anything nobler than the five companies which were in\r\nGibraltar during the great siege.\r\n\r\nThey were the five senior companies of the 2nd Battalion, and they still\r\nexist, under the altered nomenclature, as,—\r\n\r\n     No. 7 Battery, 21st Brigade Intermediately in the 6th Brigade.\r\n          2 Battery 12th Brigade\r\n          7 Battery 10th Brigade\r\n          D Battery  1st Brigade\r\n          8 Battery  3rd Brigade\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the siege, Colonel Godwin was in command of the\r\nArtillery; but he returned to England in the following year, on\r\npromotion to the command of the Battalion, and died in about six years.\r\nHe was succeeded by Colonel Tovey, the same officer who had been present\r\nwith his company at Belleisle; and who, having had practical experience\r\nof Siege Artillery of the attack, was now to head a train of Artillery\r\nof the defence, in which duty and command he died. On his death, which\r\nhappened at a most exciting period of the siege, he was succeeded by\r\nMajor Lewis, whose conspicuous gallantry and severe wounds earned for\r\nhim a well-deserved Good Service Pension.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the Artillery was wholly inadequate to the number of\r\nguns on the Rock. It amounted to a total of 25 officers, and 460 non-\r\ncommissioned officers and men; whereas, at the termination of the siege,\r\nthe following was the serviceable and mounted armament:—\r\n\r\n_Guns._—Seventy-seven 32-pounders; one hundred and twenty-two 24-\r\npounders and 26-pounders; one hundred and four 18-pounders; seventy 12-\r\npounders; sixteen 9-pounders; twenty-five 6-pounders; thirty-eight 4-\r\npounders and 3-pounders.\r\n\r\n_Mortars._—Twenty-nine 13-inch; one 10-inch; six 8-inch; and thirty-four\r\nof smaller natures.\r\n\r\n_Howitzers._—Nineteen 10-inch, and nine 8-inch.\r\n\r\nOne of the first steps taken by the Governor, General Eliott, was to\r\nattach 180 men from the infantry to the Artillery, to learn gunnery, and\r\nassist in the duties of the latter. The regiments in garrison were the\r\n12th, 39th, 56th, and 58th, also the (then) 72nd regiment. The (then)\r\n73rd and 97th regiments joined during the siege. There were also 124\r\nEngineers and artificers, and three regiments of Hanoverian troops. The\r\ntotal strength of all ranks in June 1779, was 5382; but it increased\r\nbefore the siege was over—by means of reinforcements from England—to\r\n7000.\r\n\r\nA few statistics connected with the Artillery and their duties may,\r\nperhaps, with advantage be prefaced to the account of the siege.\r\n\r\nThe amount of ammunition expended between September 1779|and February\r\n1783, was as follows:\r\n\r\n                          Shot         57,163\r\n                          Shell       129,151\r\n                          Grape        12,681\r\n                          Carcasses       926\r\n                          Light Balls     679\r\n\r\nIn all 200,600 rounds, and 8000 barrels of powder.\r\n\r\nThe preponderance of the number of shell over shot was caused by the\r\nuse, during the siege, of shell from _guns_, with reduced charges—as\r\nwell as from mortars and howitzers; suggested by Captain Mercier, of the\r\n39th Regiment, and found so successful, as almost to abolish the use of\r\nshot during the first two years. In the year 1782, however, the value of\r\nred-hot shot against the enemy's fleet and works was discovered; the\r\namount of shot expended rapidly increased; and while there was hardly a\r\nbattery without the means at hand for heating them, there was also a\r\nconstant supply, already heated, in the chief batteries.\r\n\r\nThe batteries from which the Artillery generally fired on the land side\r\nwere those known collectively as Willis's; but when the fleet, and\r\nespecially the hornet-like gunboats, commenced annoying the garrison,\r\nthe batteries towards the sea had also to be manned, and the duty became\r\nso severe, that at times the fire had to be slackened, literally to\r\nallow the men to snatch a few hours' sleep.\r\n\r\nThe proportion in the Royal Artillery of killed and wounded was very\r\ngreat. According to the records of the 2nd Battalion, the list was even\r\nheavier than that given by Drinkwater in his celebrated work; but even\r\naccepting the latter version as correct, it stood as follows:—\r\n\r\n            Out of a total of 485 of all ranks, there were:—\r\n\r\n                     Killed                      23\r\n                     Died of wounds               8\r\n                     Totally disabled            13\r\n                     Wounded                    116\r\n                     Died of sickness            36\r\n                                                ———\r\n                     Total number of casualties 196\r\n\r\nThe officers who were killed were Captain J. Reeves and Lieutenant J.\r\nGrumley. The former commenced his career as a matross, and received his\r\ncommission at the Havannah in 1762; the latter was a volunteer, attached\r\nin 1778 to the Artillery in Gibraltar, and commissioned in 1780; who\r\nenjoyed his honours for a very short time, being killed in the\r\nbombardment of the 13th of September, 1782. The officers who were\r\nwounded were Major Lewis, Captain-Lieutenant Seward, Lieutenants Boag,\r\nWillington, Godfrey, and Cuppage. Of these, Lieutenant Boag was twice\r\nwounded during the siege. He, like Captain Reeves, had commenced his\r\nservice as a matross; nor was his promotion accelerated by brevet or\r\notherwise on account of his wounds, in the dull times of reduction and\r\nstagnation, which followed the peace signed at Versailles in 1783. He\r\nwas at last appointed Major in 1801. Retiring two years later, after a\r\nservice of forty-five years, he died, as he had lived, plain James\r\nBoag,—unnoticed, forgotten, as the great siege itself was, in the\r\nboiling whirl which was circling over Europe, fevering every head and\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nTwo valuable inventions were made during the siege by Artillery\r\nofficers, to increase the efficacy of their fire. By means of one, a gun\r\ncould be depressed to any angle not exceeding 70°—a most important\r\ninvention in a fortification like Gibraltar.\r\n\r\nThe other discovery—if it may be called so—was in an opposite direction.\r\nThe nightly bombardment, in 1781, by the enemy's gunboats not merely\r\ncaused great damage and loss of life, but also an annoyance and\r\nirritation out of proportion to the injury inflicted. Governor Eliott\r\nresolved to retaliate in similar fashion, and to bombard the Spanish\r\ncamp, which it was hoped to reach by firing from the Old Mole Head. On\r\nit was placed a 13-inch sea-service mortar, fired at the usual elevation\r\nbut with a charge of from twenty-eight to thirty pounds of powder; and\r\nin the sand alongside, secured by timber, and at an angle of 42°, five\r\n32-pounders and one 18 pounder were sunk, and fired with charges of\r\nfourteen and nine pounds of powder respectively. The results were most\r\nsatisfactory,—alarming and annoying the enemy, and in proportion\r\ncheering the garrison.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible that a siege of such duration could continue without\r\nthe importance and responsibility of Artillery officers becoming\r\napparent. This fact produced an order from the Governor, which saved\r\nthem from much interference from amateur Artillerymen in the form of\r\nBrigadiers. The officers commanding in any part of the Fort were\r\nforbidden to interfere with the officers of Artillery in the execution\r\nof their duty, nor were they to give orders for firing from any of the\r\nbatteries without consulting the officer who might happen to be in\r\ncharge of the Artillery.\r\n\r\nThe life of the garrison during this weary siege was, as might be\r\nexpected, monotonous in the extreme. The distress undergone, the want of\r\nprovisions felt by all ranks, from the self denying Governor downwards;—\r\nthe hoping against hope for relief;—the childish excitement at every\r\nrumour which reached the place;—the indignation at what seemed a cruel,\r\nunnecessary, and spiteful bombardment;—and the greater fury among the\r\ntroops, when, among other results of the enemy's fire, came the\r\ndisclosure in the damaged houses and stores of the inhabitants, of large\r\nquantities of wine and provisions, hoarded through all the time of\r\nscarcity, in the hope that with still greater famine the price they\r\nwould bring would be greater too;—all these are told with the minuteness\r\nof daily observation, in the work from which all accounts of the siege\r\nare more or less drawn.\r\n\r\nThe marvellous contentment with which the troops bore privations, which\r\nthey saw were necessary; the good-humour and discipline they always\r\ndisplayed, save on the occasion just mentioned, when anger drove them\r\ninto marauding, and intoxication produced its usual effect on troops;\r\nthe extraordinary coolness and courage they displayed during even the\r\nworst part of the bombardment, a courage which was even foolhardy, and\r\nhad to be restrained; all these make this siege one of the noblest\r\nchapters in England's military history.\r\n\r\nAlthough the blockade commenced in 1779, it was April, 1781, before the\r\nbombardment from the Spanish lines, which drove the miserable\r\ntownspeople from their houses for shelter to the south of the Rock, can\r\nbe said to have regularly commenced. When it did commence, it did so in\r\nearnest; shells filled with an inflammable matter were used, which set\r\nthe buildings on fire; and a graphic description of a bombarded town may\r\nbe found in Drinkwater's pages. \"About noon, Lieutenant Budworth, of the\r\n72nd Regiment, and Surgeon Chisholme, of the 56th, were wounded by a\r\nsplinter of a shell, at the door of a northern casemate in the King's\r\nBastion. The former was dangerously scalped, and the latter had one foot\r\ntaken off, and the other leg broken, besides a wound in the knee....\r\nMany casks of flour were brought into the King's Bastion, and piled as\r\ntemporary traverses before the doors of the southern casemates, in which\r\nseveral persons had been killed and wounded in bed.... In the course of\r\nthe day, a shell fell through the roof of the galley-house, where part\r\nof the 39th and some of the 12th Regiments were quartered; it killed\r\ntwo, and wounded four privates.... In the course of the 20th April,\r\n1781, the Victualling Office was on fire for a short time; and at night,\r\nthe town was on fire in four different places.... On the 21st, the\r\nenemy's cannonade continued very brisk; forty-two rounds were counted in\r\ntwo minutes. The Garrison Flag-staff, on the Grand Battery, was so much\r\ninjured by their fire, that the upper part was obliged to be cut off,\r\nand the colours, or rather their glorious remains, were _nailed_ to the\r\nstump.... On the 23rd, the wife of a soldier was killed behind the South\r\nBarracks, and several men wounded.... On the 24th, a shell fell at the\r\ndoor of a casemate in the King's Bastion, and wounded four men _within_\r\nthe bomb-proof.... The buildings at this time exhibited a most dreadful\r\npicture of the results of so animated a bombardment. Scarce a house\r\nnorth of Grand Parade was habitable; all of them were deserted. Some few\r\nnear Southport continued to be inhabited by soldiers' families; but in\r\ngeneral, the floors and roofs were destroyed, and only the shell left\r\nstanding.... A shell from the gunboats fell in a house in Hardy Town,\r\nand killed Mr. Israel, a very respectable Jew, with Mrs. Tourale, a\r\nfemale relation, and his clerk.... A soldier of the 72nd Regiment was\r\nkilled in his bed by a round shot, and a Jew butcher was equally\r\nunfortunate.... The gunboats bombarded our camp about midnight, and\r\nkilled and wounded twelve or fourteen.... About ten o'clock on the\r\nevening of 18th September, a shell from the lines fell into a house\r\nopposite the King's Bastion, where the Town Major, Captain Burke, with\r\nMajors Mercier and Vignoles, were sitting. The shell took off Major\r\nBurke's thigh; afterwards fell through the floor into the cellar—there\r\nit burst, and forced the flooring, with the unfortunate Major, to the\r\nceiling. When assistance came, they found poor Major Burke almost buried\r\namong the ruins of the room. He was instantly conveyed to the Hospital,\r\nwhere he died soon after.... On the 30th, a soldier of the 72nd lost\r\nboth his legs by a shot from Fort Barbara.... In the afternoon of the\r\n7th October, a shell fell into a house in town, where Ensign Stephens of\r\nthe 39th was sitting. Imagining himself not safe where he was, he\r\nquitted the room to get to a more secure place; but just as he passed\r\nthe door, the shell burst, and a splinter mortally wounded him in the\r\nreins, and another took off his leg. He was conveyed to the Hospital,\r\nand had suffered amputation before the surgeons discovered the mortal\r\nwound in the body. He died about seven o'clock.... In the course of the\r\n25th March, 1782, a shot came through one of the capped embrasures on\r\nPrincess Amelia's Battery, took off the legs of two men belonging to the\r\n72nd and 73rd Regiments, one leg of another soldier of the 73rd, and\r\nwounded another man in both legs; thus four men had seven legs taken off\r\nand wounded by one shot.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so on, _ad infinitum_. The daily life was like this; for although\r\neven worse was to come at the final attack, this wearying, cruel\r\nbombardment went on literally every day. On the 5th May, 1782, the\r\nbombardment ceased for twenty-four hours, for the first time during\r\nthirteen months.\r\n\r\nAs in the time of great pestilence, after the first alarm has subsided,\r\nthere is a callous indifference, which creeps over those who have\r\nescaped, and among whom the familiarity with Death seems almost to have\r\nbred contempt, so—during this long siege—after the novelty and\r\nexcitement of the first few days' bombardment had worn off, the men\r\nbecame so indifferent to the danger, that, when a shell fell near them,\r\nthe officer in charge would often have to compel them to take the\r\ncommonest precautions. The fire of the enemy became a subject of wit\r\neven, and laughter, among the men; and probably the unaccustomed silence\r\nof that 5th of May, when the bombardment was suspended, was quite\r\nirksome to these creatures of habit, whose favourite theme of\r\nconversation was thus removed.\r\n\r\nAmong the incidents of the bombardment, there was one which demands\r\ninsertion in this work, as the victim—a matross—belonged to the Royal\r\nArtillery. Shortly before the bombardment commenced, he had broken his\r\nthigh; and being a hearty, active fellow, he found the confinement in\r\nhospital very irksome. He managed to get out of the ward before he was\r\ncured, and his spirits proving too much for him, he forgot his broken\r\nleg, and falling again, he was taken up as bad as ever. While lying in\r\nthe ward for the second time under treatment, a shell from one of the\r\ngunboats entered, and rebounding, lodged on his body as he lay, the\r\nshell spent, but the fuze burning. The other sick men in the room\r\nsummoned strength to crawl out of the ward before the shell burst; but\r\nthis poor fellow was kept down in his bed by the weight of the shell,\r\nand the shock of the blow, and when it burst, it took off both his legs,\r\nand scorched him frightfully. Wonderful to say, he survived a short\r\ntime, and remained sensible to the last. Before he died he expressed his\r\nregret that he had not been killed in the batteries. Heroic, noble wish!\r\nWhile men like these are to be found in the ranks of our armies, let no\r\nman despair. Heroism such as this, in an educated man, may be inspired\r\nby mixed motives—personal courage, hope of being remembered with honour,\r\npride in what will be said at home, and, perhaps, a touch of theatrical\r\neffect,—but, in a man like this brave matross, whose courage has failed\r\neven to rescue his name from oblivion, although his story remains—the\r\nheroism is pure and simple—unalloyed, and the mere expression of\r\ndevotion to duty, for duty's sake. And this heroism is god-like!\r\n\r\nThis was but one of many heroic actions performed by men of the Royal\r\nArtillery. Another deserves mention, in which the greatest coolness and\r\npresence of mind were displayed. A gunner, named Hartley, was employed\r\nin the laboratory, filling shells with carcass composition and fixing\r\nfuzes. During the operation a fuze ignited, and \"Although he was\r\nsurrounded by unfixed fuzes, loaded shells, composition, &c., with the\r\nmost astonishing coolness he carried out the lighted shell, and threw it\r\nwhere it could do little or no harm. Two seconds had scarcely elapsed,\r\nbefore it exploded. If the shell had burst in the laboratory, it is\r\nalmost certain the whole would have been blown up—when the loss in fixed\r\nammunition, fuzes, &c., would have been irreparable—exclusive of the\r\ndamage which the fortifications would have suffered from the explosion,\r\nand the lives that might have been lost.\"[27]\r\n\r\nYet again. On New Year's Day, 1782, an officer of Artillery in Willis's\r\nBatteries, observing a shell about to fall near where he was standing,\r\ngot behind a traverse for shelter. The shell struck this very traverse,\r\nand _before_ bursting, half buried him with the earth loosened by the\r\nimpact. One of the guard—named Martin—observing his officer's position,\r\nhurried, in spite of the risk to his own life when the shell should\r\nburst, and endeavoured to extricate him from the rubbish. Unable to do\r\nit by himself, he called for assistance, and another of the guard,\r\nequally regardless of personal danger, ran to him, and they had hardly\r\nsucceeded in extricating their officer, when the shell burst and\r\nlevelled the traverse with the ground.\r\n\r\nThis great siege of Calpe, the fourteenth to which the Rock had been\r\nsubjected, divides itself into three epochs. First, the monotonous\r\nblockade, commencing in July, 1779; second, the bombardment which\r\ncommenced in April, 1781; and third, the grand attack, on the 13th\r\nSeptember, 1782.\r\n\r\nThe blockade was varied by occasional reliefs and reinforcements; and\r\nwas accompanied by an incessant fire from the guns of the fortress on\r\nthe Spanish works. The batteries most used at first were Willis's, so\r\ncalled (according to an old MS. of 1705, in the Royal Artillery Record\r\nOffice), because the man who was most energetic, when these batteries\r\nwere first armed, bore that name. When the attacks from the gunboats\r\ncommenced, the batteries to the westward—the King's Bastions and others—\r\nwere also employed. The steady fire kept up by the Artillery, its\r\naccuracy, and the improvements in it suggested by the experience of the\r\nsiege, were themes of universal admiration; and the many ingenious\r\ndevices, some of them copied by the enemy, by which, with the assistance\r\nof the Engineers, they masked, strengthened, and repaired their\r\nbatteries, form a most interesting study for the modern Artilleryman.\r\nThe incessant Artillery duel, which went on, made the gunners' nights as\r\nsleepless frequently as their days; for the hours of darkness had to be\r\ndevoted to repairing the damages sustained during the day. Well may the\r\ncelebrated chronicler of the siege talk of them as \"our brave\r\nArtillery,\"—brave in the sense of continuous endurance, not merely\r\nspasmodic effort.\r\n\r\nAt the siege of Belleisle, described in a former chapter, the failing\r\nammunition of the enemy was indicated by the use of wooden and stone\r\nprojectiles. The latter were used by the Royal Artillery at Gibraltar,\r\nbut for a different reason. To check and distract the working-parties of\r\nthe enemy, shell had been chiefly employed by the garrison; and the\r\nproficiency they attained in the use of these projectiles can easily be\r\naccounted for, when it is remembered how soon and how accurately every\r\nrange could be ascertained; how eager the gunners were to make every\r\nshot tell; and how exceedingly important it was to check the continued\r\nadvance of the enemy's works. For variety's sake, it would seem, for\r\nthere was no need to economize shell at this time—in pure boyish love of\r\nchange, the Artillerymen devised stone balls, perforated so as to admit\r\nof a small bursting-charge, and a short fuze; and it was found that the\r\nbursting of these projectiles over the Spanish working-parties caused\r\nthem incredible annoyance.\r\n\r\nAlthough the fire of the garrison during the first epoch of the siege\r\nwas the most important consideration, and its value could hardly be\r\noverrated, as to it alone was any hope due of prolonging the defence\r\nuntil help should come from England,—it was not the only distinctive\r\nfeature of this time. It was during the blockade that the garrison was\r\nmost sorely tried by the scarcity of food. And in forming our estimate\r\nof the defence of Gibraltar, it should never be forgotten that the\r\ndefenders were always the same—unrelieved, without communication with\r\nany back country; and with hardly any reinforcements to ease the heavy\r\nduties. The 97th Regiment, which arrived during the siege, was long in\r\nthe garrison before it was permitted, or indeed was able, to take its\r\nshare of duty; and the hard work, as well as the hard fare, fell upon\r\nthe same individuals.\r\n\r\nThe statistics, given so curtly by Drinkwater, as to the famine in the\r\nplace, enable us to realize the daily privations of the troops. At one\r\ntime, scurvy had so reduced the effective strength of the garrison, that\r\na shipload of lemons which arrived was a more valuable contingent than\r\nseveral regiments would have been. In reading the account of this, with\r\nall the quiet arguments as to the value of lemon-juice, and its effect\r\nupon the patients, one cannot but wish, that in every military operation\r\nthere were artists like Drinkwater to fill in the details of those\r\npictures, whose outlines may be drawn by military commanders, or by the\r\nlogic of events, but whose canvas becomes doubly inviting through the\r\nagency of the other industrious and unobtrusive brush. Modern warlike\r\noperations suffer from an overabundance of description; but the skeleton\r\nsupplied by official reports, and the frequent flabbiness of those\r\nrendered by newspaper correspondents, produce a result far inferior to\r\nthe compact picture presented by a writer at once observant and\r\nprofessional.\r\n\r\nIn a table, at the end of Drinkwater's work, crowded out of the book, as\r\nif hardly worthy of mention, and yet most precious to the student now,\r\nwe find some of the prices paid for articles of food during the siege.\r\nFowls brought over a guinea a couple; beef as much as 4_s._ 10_d._ per\r\npound; a goose, 30_s._; best tea as high as 2_l._ 5_s._ 6_d._ per pound;\r\neggs, as much as 4_s._ 10½_d._ per dozen; cheese, 4_s._ 1_d._ per pound;\r\nonions, 2_s._ 6_d._ per pound; a cabbage, 1_s._ 7½_d._; a live pig,\r\n9_l._ 14_s._ 9_d._; and a sow in pig, over 29_l._\r\n\r\nThe high price, at times, of all vegetables, was an index of the\r\nexistence of that terrible scourge—scurvy.\r\n\r\nSome very quaint sales took place. An English cow was sold during the\r\nblockade for fifty guineas, reserving to the sellers a pint of milk each\r\nday while she continued to give it; while another cow was purchased by a\r\nJew for sixty guineas, but in so feeble a state, that she dropped down\r\ndead before she had been removed many hundred yards. The imagination\r\nfails in attempting to realize the purchaser's face—a Jew, and a\r\nGibraltar Jew; but can readily conceive the laugh against him among the\r\nsurrounding crowd, their haggard faces looking more ghastly as they\r\nsmiled. Although Englishmen take their pleasure sadly, they also bear\r\ntheir troubles lightly. An English soldier must be reduced indeed, ere\r\nhe fails to enjoy a joke at another man's expense, and this\r\ncharacteristic was not wanting at Gibraltar.\r\n\r\nThe second epoch—the Bombardment—was at first hardly believed to be\r\npossible. The fire of the garrison was directed against an assailant and\r\na masculine force; but a bombardment of Gibraltar meant—in the minds of\r\nits defenders—a wanton sacrifice of women and children; a wholesale\r\nmurder of unwarlike inhabitants, who could not escape, and to whom the\r\nclaims of the conflicting Powers were immaterial. The wailing of women\r\nover murdered children, of children over wounded parents; the smoking\r\nruins of recently happy homes; the distress of the flying tradespeople\r\nand their families, seeking safety to the southward of the Rock, and\r\nabandoning their treasures to bombardment and pillage; all these told\r\nwith irritating effect upon the troops of a country whose sons are\r\nchivalrous without being demonstrative. In days coming on—in terrible\r\ndays which many who read these pages may have lived in and seen, English\r\ntroops shall clench their hands, and set their teeth with cruel\r\nhardness, as they come upon little female relics—articles of jewellery\r\nor dress—perhaps even locks of hair, scattered in hideous abandonment\r\nnear that well at Cawnpore, whose horrors have often been imagined—never\r\ntold. To those who have seen this picture, the feelings of the\r\nbeleaguered garrison in Gibraltar will be easily intelligible, as they\r\nstumbled in the town over a corpse—and that corpse a woman's. No wonder\r\nthat when the great sally took place, historical as much for its\r\nboldness as its success, there was an angry desperation among the\r\ntroops, which it would have taken tremendous obstacles to resist. It was\r\na brave morning, that 27th of November, 1781, when \"the moon's nightly\r\ncourse was \"nearly run,\"[28] and ere the sun had risen, a little over\r\n2000 men sallied forth to destroy the advanced works of the enemy—an\r\nenemy 14,000 strong—and works, three-quarters of a mile from the\r\ngarrison, and \"within a few hundred yards of the enemy's lines, which\r\nmounted 135 pieces of heavy artillery.\"[28] The officers and men of the\r\nRoyal Artillery who took part in the sortie, numbered 114; and were\r\ndivided into detachments to accompany the three columns of the sallying\r\nforce, to spike the enemy's guns, destroy their magazines and\r\nammunition, and set fire to their works. It was the last order issued in\r\nColonel Tovey's name to the brave men whom he had commanded since the\r\npromotion of Colonel Godwin. For Abraham Tovey was sick unto death; and\r\nas his men were parading for the sortie, and the moon was running her\r\nnightly course—his was running fast too. Before his men returned, he was\r\ndead. For nearly half a century he had served in the Royal Artillery—\r\nbeginning his career as a matross in 1734, and ending it as a\r\nLieutenant-Colonel in 1781. He died in harness—died in the command of a\r\nforce of Garrison Artillery which has never been surpassed nor equalled,\r\nsave by the great and famous siege-train in the Crimea.\r\n\r\nThe troops for the sortie paraded at midnight, on the Red Sands, under\r\nBrigadier-General Ross. They consisted of the 12th Regiment, and\r\nHardenberg's—two which had fought side by side at Minden—and the\r\nGrenadiers and light infantry of the other regiments. There were also,\r\nin addition to the Artillery, 100 sailors, 3 Engineers, with 7 officers\r\nand 12 non-commissioned officers, overseers, 40 artificers, and 160 men\r\nfrom the line as a working party. A reserve of the 39th and 58th\r\nRegiments was also in readiness, if required.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the works, \"The ardour of the assailants was irresistible.\r\nThe enemy on every side gave way, abandoning in an instant, and with the\r\nutmost precipitation, those works which had cost them so much expense,\r\nand employed so many months to perfect.... The exertions of the workmen,\r\nand the Artillery, were wonderful. The batteries were soon in a state\r\nfor the fire faggots to operate; and the flames spread with astonishing\r\nrapidity into every part. The column of fire and smoke which rolled from\r\nthe works, beautifully illuminated the troops and neighbouring objects,\r\nforming altogether a _coup d'œil_ not possible to be described. In an\r\nhour, the object of the sortie was fully effected.\"[29]\r\n\r\nThe third epoch, culminating in the grand attack on the 13th September,\r\n1782, is deeply interesting. The fate of Minorca had released a number\r\nof Spanish troops, to act against Gibraltar; and large French\r\nreinforcements had arrived. On the land side, there were now \"Most\r\nstupendous and strong batteries and works, mounting two hundred pieces\r\nof heavy ordnance, and protected by an army of near 40,000 men,\r\ncommanded by a victorious and active general, the Duke de Crillon; and\r\nanimated by the immediate presence of two Princes of the Royal Blood of\r\nFrance.\" From the sea, the Fort was menaced by forty-seven sail of the\r\nline:—\"Ten battering-ships, deemed perfect in design, and esteemed\r\ninvincible, carrying 212 guns; besides innumerable frigates, xebeques,\r\nbomb-ketches, cutters, gun and mortar-boats, and smaller craft for\r\ndisembarking men.\"[29]\r\n\r\nIt was during the bombardment immediately preceding the grand attack,\r\nthat Major Lewis was wounded, and Lieutenant Boag received his second\r\nwound, the latter in a singular manner. He was in the act of laying a\r\ngun, when a shell fell in the Battery. He immediately threw himself into\r\nan embrasure for safety when the shell should explode; but when the\r\nshell burst, it _fired the gun under whose muzzle he lay_. Besides other\r\ninjury, the report deprived him of hearing, and it was very long ere he\r\nrecovered. Another officer of the Artillery, Major Martin, had a narrow\r\nescape at the same time, a 26-pounder shot carrying away the cock of his\r\nhat, near the crown.\r\n\r\nThe 26-pounder was a very common gun, both in the Rock and in the\r\nenemy's land-batteries; but as it was not used on board their ships, and\r\nto prevent them returning the shot of the garrison against themselves,\r\nall the 26-pounders were moved to the seaward batteries, and fired\r\nagainst the ships, guns of other calibres being employed against the\r\nland forces.\r\n\r\nThe battering ships, with their supposed impregnable shields, were the\r\nmainstay of the enemy's hopes; but the use of red-hot shot by the\r\ngarrison made them after a time perfectly useless.\r\n\r\nWhen the cannonade was at its highest pitch, on the day of the grand\r\nattack, \"the showers of shot and shell which were directed from the\r\nenemy's land-batteries, the battering-ships, and, on the other hand,\r\nfrom the various works of the garrison, exhibited a scene of which,\r\nperhaps, neither the pen nor pencil can furnish a competent idea. It is\r\nsufficient to say that four hundred pieces of the heaviest Artillery\r\nwere playing at the same moment: an instance which has scarcely occurred\r\nin any siege since the invention of those wonderful engines of\r\ndestruction.\"[30]\r\n\r\nAt first the battering-ships seemed to deserve their reputation. \"Our\r\nheaviest shells often rebounded from their tops, whilst the 32-pound\r\nshot seemed incapable of making any visible impression upon their\r\nhulls.... Even the Artillery themselves at this period had their doubts\r\nof the effect of the red-hot shot.... Though so vexatiously annoyed from\r\nthe Isthmus, our Artillery totally disregarded their opponents in that\r\nquarter, directing their sole attention to the battering-ships, the\r\nfurious and spirited opposition of which served to excite our people to\r\nmore animated exertions. A fire, more tremendous, if possible, than ever\r\nwas therefore directed from the garrison. Incessant showers of hot\r\nballs, carcasses, and shells of every species flew from all quarters;\r\nand as the masts of several of the ships were shot away, and the rigging\r\nof all in great confusion, our hopes of a speedy and favourable decision\r\nbegan to revive.\"[31]\r\n\r\nTowards evening, signs of great distress and confusion were visible on\r\nboard the ships, and the Admiral's ship was seen to be on fire. But not\r\nuntil next morning did the garrison realize how great was their\r\nadvantage. In the meantime the fire was continued, though less rapidly;\r\nand \"as the Artillery, from such a hard-fought day, exposed to the\r\nintense heat of a warm sun, in addition to the harassing duties of the\r\npreceding night, were much fatigued; and as it was impossible to foresee\r\nwhat new objects might demand their service the following day; the\r\nGovernor about six in the evening, when the enemy's fire abated,\r\npermitted the majority of the officers and men to be relieved by a\r\npiquet of a hundred men from the Marine Brigade; and officers and non-\r\ncommissioned officers of the Artillery were stationed on the different\r\nbatteries, to direct the sailors in the mode of firing the hot\r\nshot.\"[31]\r\n\r\nDuring the night, several of the battering-ships took fire, and the\r\nscenes on board were terrible. Next day \"three more blew up, and three\r\nwere burnt to the water's edge;\" and of the only two remaining, one\r\n\"unexpectedly burst out into flames, and in a short time blew up, with a\r\nterrible report,\" and the other was burnt in the afternoon by an officer\r\nof the English navy.\r\n\r\n\"The exertions and activity of the brave Artillery,\" says Drinkwater,\r\n\"in this well-fought contest, deserve the highest commendations.... The\r\nordnance and carriages in the Fort were much damaged; but by the\r\nactivity of the Artillery, the whole sea-line before night was in\r\nserviceable order.... During this action the enemy had more than three\r\nhundred pieces of heavy ordnance in play; whilst the garrison had only\r\neighty cannon, seven mortars, and nine howitzers in opposition. Upwards\r\nof 8300|rounds, more than half of which were hot-shot, and 716 barrels\r\nof powder, were expended by our Artillery.... The distance of the\r\nbattering-ships from the garrison was exactly such as our Artillery\r\ncould have wished. It required so small an elevation that almost every\r\nshot took effect.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 13th, the day of the attack, Captain Reeves and five men of the\r\nRoyal Artillery were killed: Captains Groves and Seward, and Lieutenant\r\nGodfrey, with twenty-one men, were wounded.\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, as Carlyle says, a \"Doom's-blast of a No,\" which the\r\nArtillery of Gibraltar answered to the summons of this grand attack.\r\n\r\nAfter the failure of the attack, the enemy did not discontinue their old\r\nbombardment, nor did the gunboats fail to make their nightly appearance,\r\nand molest the inhabitants longing for rest. The Governor accordingly\r\ndirected the Artillery to resume the retaliation from the Old Mole Head\r\nwith the highly-elevated guns against the enemy's camp. The command of\r\nthe Royal Artillery now lay with Colonel Williams, an officer who joined\r\nthe service as a cadet-gunner in 1744, and died at Woolwich in 1790.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Artillery in the interval between the grand attack and\r\nthe declaration of peace was incessant, day and night.\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd February, 1783, exchange of shots ceased; and letters were\r\nsent by the Spanish to the Governor announcing that the preliminaries of\r\npeace were signed at Paris. From this date, courtesies were constantly\r\nexchanged. It was on the occasion of a friendly visit of the Duke de\r\nCrillon to the Fort, that on the officers of Artillery being presented\r\nto him he said, \"Gentlemen! I would rather see you here as friends, than\r\non your batteries as enemies, where you never spared me.\"\r\n\r\nThe siege had lasted in all three years, seven months, and twelve days;\r\nand during this time the troops had well earned the expressions used\r\nwith regard to them by General Eliott, when he paraded them to receive\r\nthe thanks of the Houses of Parliament,—\"Your cheerful submission to the\r\ngreatest hardships, your matchless spirit and exertions, and on all\r\noccasions your heroic contempt of every danger.\"\r\n\r\nTo the Artillery, for their share in this matchless defence, there came\r\nalso the commendation of their own chief, the Master-General of the\r\nOrdnance, then the Duke of Richmond. The old records of the Regiment\r\nseem to sparkle and shine as one comes on such a sentence as this:—\"His\r\nMajesty has seen with great satisfaction such effectual proofs of the\r\nbravery, zeal, and skill by which you and the Royal Regiment of\r\nArtillery under your command at Gibraltar have so eminently\r\ndistinguished yourselves during the siege; and particularly in setting\r\nfire to, and destroying all the floating batteries of the combined\r\nforces of France and Spain on the 13th September last.\"\r\n\r\nThere was so much in the Peace of 1783 that was painful to England, not\r\nso much in a military as in a political point of view, but undoubtedly\r\nin the former also, that one hesitates to leave this bright spot in the\r\nhistory of the time, and to turn back to that weary seven years'\r\ncatalogue in America, of blunders, dissensions, and loss. It was one and\r\nthe same Peace which celebrated the salvation of Gibraltar, and the loss\r\nof our American Colonies. A strong arm saved the one: a foolish\r\nstatesmanship lost the other. But be statesmen wise or foolish, armies\r\nhave to march where they order; and the history of a foolish war has to\r\nbe written as well as that of a wise one.\r\n\r\nIt was October, 1783, ere the companies of the Royal Artillery which had\r\nbeen present at the Great Siege returned to Woolwich on relief. The next\r\nactive service they saw was in Egypt in 1801, when three of them, Nos.\r\n1, 2, and 4 Companies of the Second Battalion, were present with\r\nAbercromby's force at the Battle of Alexandria, and during the\r\nsubsequent operations.\r\n\r\nTo serve in one of these companies is to serve in one whose antecedents\r\nas Garrison Artillery are unsurpassed. Their story is one which should\r\nbe handed down among the officers and men belonging to them: for they\r\nhave a reputation to maintain, which no altered nomenclature can justify\r\nthem in allowing to become tarnished.\r\n\r\nThere is no fear of courage being wanting; but the standard from which\r\nthere should be no falling away is that of conduct and proficiency,\r\nworthy of the old proficiency maintained under such harsh circumstances,\r\nand of the old conduct which shone so brightly in the \"cheerful\r\nsubmission to the greatest hardships.\"\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 27:\r\n\r\n  Drinkwater.\r\n\r\nFootnote 28:\r\n\r\n  Drinkwater.\r\n\r\nFootnote 29:\r\n\r\n  Drinkwater.\r\n\r\nFootnote 30:\r\n\r\n  Drinkwater.\r\n\r\nFootnote 31:\r\n\r\n  Drinkwater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVI.\r\n                              PORT MAHON.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE military importance of the capture of Minorca from the English in\r\n1782 was not, perhaps, such as to warrant a separate chapter for its\r\nconsideration. But the defence of St. Philip's Castle by the English\r\nagainst the combined forces of France and Spain was so exceptionally\r\ngallant, their sufferings so great, and the zeal and courage of the\r\nArtillery, especially, so conspicuous, that something more than a\r\npassing mention is necessary in a work of this nature.\r\n\r\nThe siege lasted from the 19th August, 1781, to the 5th February, 1782.\r\nGeneral Murray was Governor, and Sir William Draper, Lieutenant-\r\nGovernor. The strength of the garrison at the commencement of the siege\r\nwas 2295 of all ranks; at the end of the siege, this number had been\r\nreduced to 1227, but so many of these were in hospital, that the whole\r\nnumber able to march out at the capitulation did not exceed—to use the\r\nGovernor's own words—\"600 old decrepit soldiers, 200 seamen, 170 of the\r\nRoyal Artillery, 20 Corsicans, 25 Greeks, Moors, &c.\"\r\n\r\nIn a postscript to the official report of the capitulation the Governor\r\nsays:—\"It would be unjust and ungrateful were I not to declare that from\r\nthe beginning to the last hour of the siege, the officers and men of the\r\nRoyal Regiment of Artillery distinguished themselves. I believe the\r\nworld cannot produce more expert gunners and bombardiers than those who\r\nserved in this siege.\" This alone would make imperative some notice of\r\nthis siege in a narrative of the services of the Corps.\r\n\r\nIn the Castle of St. Philip's, there were at the commencement of the\r\nsiege 234 guns and mortars. At the end, no less than 78 of these had\r\nbeen rendered unserviceable by the enemy's fire. The batteries were\r\nalmost demolished, and the buildings a heap of ruins.\r\n\r\nThe following officers of the Royal Artillery were present:\r\n\r\n  Major WALTON.\r\n\r\n  Captains: FEAD, LAMBERT, SCHALCH, PARRY, and DIXON.\r\n\r\n  First Lieutenants: IRWIN, WOODWARD, LEMOINE, NEVILLE, and\r\n    BRADBRIDGE.\r\n\r\n  Second Lieutenants: HOPE, WULFF, and HAMILTON.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Artillery the garrison was composed of two Regiments\r\nof British, and two of Hanoverian troops.\r\n\r\nThe commandant of the enemy's forces was the Duke de Crillon, the same\r\nofficer who after the capitulation of St. Philip's proceeded to command\r\nat the Siege of Gibraltar. He drew upon himself a well-merited rebuke\r\nfrom General Murray, whom he had endeavoured to bribe, with a view to\r\nthe immediate surrender of the Castle; a rebuke which he felt, and\r\nanswered with great respect and admiration.\r\n\r\nThere is in the Royal Artillery Record Office a journal kept during the\r\nsiege by Captain F. M. Dixon, R.A., from which the following details are\r\ntaken, many of which would lose their force if given except in the\r\nwriter's own words. The siege commenced on the 20th August, when there\r\nwas nothing but confusion and disorder within St. Philip's, to which the\r\ntroops had retired; but the enemy did not commence firing on the Castle\r\nuntil the 15th September. The English had not been so quiet; they\r\ncommenced firing at a great range on the 27th August, and with great\r\nsuccess. At the request of the Duke de Crillon, all the English families\r\nhad been sent out, in humane anticipation of the intended bombardment.\r\nDesertion from the enemy was frequent at first; and as the siege\r\nprogressed it was occasional from the British troops. When a deserter\r\nwas captured, he received no mercy.\r\n\r\nThe most deadly enemy of the garrison was scurvy. Hence an order on the\r\n7th November, 1781, for an officer and six men per company to be told\r\noff daily to gather pot-herbs on the glacis. Anything of a vegetable\r\nnature brought a fabulous price; tea was sold at thirty shillings a\r\npound; the number of sick increased every day, the men concealing their\r\nillness to the last rather than go to hospital, and very frequently\r\ndying on duty from sheer exhaustion:—\"Our people,\" says the diary, \"do\r\nmore than can be expected, considering their strength; the scurvy is\r\ninveterate.... 108 men fell sick in two days with the scurvy.... I am\r\nsorry our men are so very sickly; our people fall down surprisingly, we\r\nhave not a relief.... The Hanoverians die very fast: there is no\r\nfighting against God.... Our troops increase vastly in their sickness;\"\r\nand so on. Among those who fell a victim during the siege was Captain\r\nLambert, of the Artillery.\r\n\r\nSo heavy were the duties that even the General's orderly sergeants were\r\ngiven up to diminish the burden; and when the capitulation was resolved\r\nupon, it was found that while the necessary guards required 415 men,\r\nthere were only 660 able to carry arms, leaving, as the Governor said,\r\nno men for piquet, and a deficiency of 170 men to relieve the guard.\r\nAgainst this small force, entrenched in what was now a mere heap of\r\nrubbish, there was an enemy, whose lowest number was estimated at\r\n15,000, and was more likely 20,000.\r\n\r\nSome of the enemy's batteries were armed with 13-inch mortars. When the\r\nBritish ammunition ran short, the shells of the enemy which had not\r\nburst were returned to them, and in default of these, stone projectiles\r\nwere used with much effect.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th December, 1781, the following batteries had been opened\r\nagainst the Castle:—\r\n\r\n Hangman's Battery,                    containing  8 guns and 4 mortars.\r\n\r\n Beneside Battery,                     containing 15 guns.\r\n\r\n Dragoon Battery,                      containing 15 guns.\r\n\r\n Burgos's Battery,                     containing 28 guns.\r\n\r\n Swiss Battery,                        containing 14 to 16 guns.\r\n\r\n America Battery,                      containing 14 to 16 guns.\r\n\r\n Murcia Battery,                       containing 14 to 16 guns.\r\n\r\n A small Battery,                      containing  6 mortars.\r\n\r\n Assessor's Battery,                   containing  6 guns.\r\n\r\n Cove Battery,                         containing  6 guns and 3 mortars.\r\n\r\n George Town Battery,                  containing  6 guns and 4 mortars.\r\n\r\n French Battery,                       containing 12 guns.\r\n\r\n _St. Geordi_ Battery,                 containing  6 guns and 3 mortars.\r\n\r\n Russian Hospital,                     containing 26 guns.\r\n\r\n A Battery on the road to Philipet     containing 10 guns.\r\n   Cove,\r\n\r\nBut the above list does not exhaust the number which ultimately directed\r\ntheir fire on the Castle. New batteries were prepared without\r\nintermission, hemming in with a deadly circle the devoted garrison. Some\r\nextracts from Captain Dixon's diary will give some idea of the fire to\r\nwhich the place was subjected:—\r\n\r\nJanuary 6th, 1782. \"A little before seven o'clock this morning they gave\r\nthree cheers and fired a _feu de joie_; then all their batteries fired\r\nupon us with great fury, which was equally returned by our brave\r\nArtillery. Our General declared he had never seen guns and mortars\r\nbetter served than ours were.\"\r\n\r\nJanuary 7th, 1782. \"Such a terrible fire, night and day, from both\r\nsides, never has been seen at any siege. We knew of 86 brass guns and 40\r\nmortars against us.... Our batteries are greatly demolished; it is with\r\ngreat difficulty that we can stand to our guns.\"\r\n\r\nJanuary 9. \"All last night and this day they never ceased firing, and we\r\nas well returned it. You would have thought the elements were in a\r\nblaze. It has been observed they fire about 750 shot and shell every\r\nhour. Who in the name of God is able to stand it? We hear they have 200\r\nguns in their park.\"\r\n\r\nJanuary 10. \"The enemy had 36 shells in flight at the same time. God has\r\nbeen with us in preserving our people: they are in high spirits, and\r\nbehave as Englishmen. Considering our small garrison, they do wonders.\r\nOur Generals constantly visit all the works.... A great number of shells\r\nfell within the limits of the Castle.... A shell fell in the General's\r\nquarters, wounded Captain Fead of the Artillery, and two other\r\nofficers.\"\r\n\r\nJanuary 11. \"The enemy keep up, if possible, a fiercer fire than\r\nyesterday. A man might safely swear, for six days past, the firing was\r\nso quick that it was like a proof at Woolwich of 200 cannon. About a\r\nquarter past six, the enemy began to fire shells, I may say\r\ninnumerable.\"\r\n\r\nJanuary 19. \"Never was Artillery better served, I may say in favour of\r\nour own corps.\"\r\n\r\nJanuary 20. \"This night shells meet shells in the air. We have a great\r\nmany sick and wounded, and those that have died of their wounds.... Our\r\nsentries have hardly time to call out, 'A shell!' and 'Down!' before\r\nothers are at their heels.\"\r\n\r\nJanuary 24. \"The Artillery have had hard duty and are greatly fatigued.\r\nThe scurvy rages among our men.\"\r\n\r\nThe casualties among the small garrison, between the 6th and 25th of\r\nJanuary, 1782, included 24 killed, 34 died, 71 wounded, and 4 deserted.\r\n\r\nJanuary 28, 1782. \"They fire shot and shell every minute. The poor\r\nCastle is in a tattered and rotten condition, as indeed are all the\r\nworks in general.... The Castle and every battery round it are so filled\r\nby the excavations made by the enemy's shells, that he must be a nimble\r\nyoung man who can go from one battery to another without danger. The\r\nCastle, their grand mark, as well as the rest of the works, are in a\r\nmost shocking plight.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 4th February, a new and powerful battery of the enemy's, on a\r\nvery commanding situation, being ready to open fire, a white flag was\r\nhoisted, the drums beat a parley, and an officer was sent out with the\r\nproposed terms of capitulation; which were ultimately amended and agreed\r\nto. By the second Article of the Treaty, \"in consideration of the\r\nconstancy and valour with which General Murray and his garrison have\r\nbehaved by their brave defence, they shall be permitted to march out\r\nwith shouldered arms, drums beating, matches lighted, and colours\r\nflying, until they get towards the centre of the Spanish troops.\" This\r\nwas done at noon on the following day, between two lines of the Spanish\r\nand French troops. So pitiable and deplorable was the appearance of the\r\nhandful of men who marched out that the conquerors are said to have shed\r\ntears as they looked at them. In the official report of General Murray,\r\nhe alludes to this, saying that the Duke de Crillon averred it to be\r\ntrue. When the men laid down their arms, they declared that they\r\nsurrendered them to God alone, \"having the consolation that the victors\r\ncould not plume themselves upon taking a hospital.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Schalch was the senior officer of Artillery left to march out at\r\nthe head of the dwindled and crippled remnant of the three companies. Of\r\nthem, and their comrades of the other arms, the Governor said in a final\r\nGeneral Order, dated at Mahon, 28th February, 1782, that he had not\r\nwords to express his admiration of their brave behaviour; and that while\r\nhe lived he should be proud of calling himself the father of such\r\ndistinguished officers and soldiers as he had had the honour to command.\r\n\r\nSo ended the Train of Artillery for Port Mahon, which the reader will\r\nremember was one of those quoted in 1716 as a reason for some permanent\r\nforce of Artillery at home. Since 1709, with a short interval in the\r\ntime of the Seven Years' War, a train had remained in Minorca; but now,\r\noverpowered by numbers, the force of which it was a part had to evacuate\r\nthe island. It was a stirring time for the Foreign establishments, as\r\nthey were called in pre-regimental days: that in Gibraltar was earning\r\nfor itself an immortal name; those in America were within the clouds of\r\nsmoke and war which covered the whole continent; and this one had just\r\nbeen compelled to die hard. Of the four, which were used as arguments\r\nfor the creation of the Royal Regiment of Artillery, only one remains at\r\nthis day—that at Gibraltar. Those at Annapolis and Placentia have\r\nvanished before the breath of economy, and the dawn of a new colonial\r\nsystem; and in this brief chapter may be learnt the end of the other,\r\nthe Train of Artillery for service at Port Mahon.\r\n\r\n  _N.B._—It is worthy of mention, that during this siege, three non-\r\n  commissioned officers, Sergeants-Major J. Swaine, J. Shand, and J.\r\n  Rostrow, were commissioned as Second Lieutenants in the Regiment, by\r\n  the Governor, for their gallantry. They were afterwards posted to\r\n  the Invalid Battalion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVII.\r\n                   THE AMERICAN WAR OF INDEPENDENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHERE are few campaigns in English history which have been more\r\nsystematically misunderstood, and more deliberately ignored, than the\r\nAmerican War between 1775 and 1783. The disadvantages under which the\r\nBritish troops laboured were many and great; they were not merely local,\r\nas in most English wars, but were magnified and intensified by the\r\nunpopularity of the campaign at home, by the positive hostility of a\r\nlarge party, including some of the most eloquent politicians, and by the\r\ninflated statements of the Government, which made the tale of disaster—\r\nwhen it came to be known—more irritating and intolerable.\r\n\r\nSoldiers will fight for a nation which is in earnest: British soldiers\r\nwill even fight when they are merely the police to execute the wishes of\r\na Government, instead of a people. But in the one case they are fired\r\nwith enthusiasm,—in the other, their prompter is the coldest duty.\r\n\r\nThe American War was at once unpopular and unsuccessful. When it was\r\nover, the nation seemed inspired by a longing to forget it; it was\r\nassociated in their minds with everything that was unpleasant; and the\r\nlabour of searching for the points in it which were worthy of being\r\ntreasured was not appreciated. English historians have always been\r\nreluctant to pen the pages of their country's disasters; and their\r\nsilence is at once characteristic of, and thoroughly understood by, the\r\nEnglish people. There has, however, been a species of self-denying\r\nordinance laid down by English writers, and spouted _ad nauseam_ by\r\nEnglish speakers, in which the whole blame of this war is accepted\r\nalmost greedily and its losses painted in heightened colours as the\r\nlegitimate consequences of national error. England _was_ to blame—\r\ntaxation without representation undoubtedly is unjust; but were American\r\nmotives at the outset pure? It may readily be granted that after the\r\nfirst shedding of blood the resistance of the colonists was prompted by\r\na keen sense of injury such as might well animate a free and high-\r\nspirited people; but, before the sword was drawn, the motives of the\r\nBoston recusants no more deserve to be called worthy, than the policy of\r\nEngland deserves to be called statesmanship.\r\n\r\nEngland, with the name, had also the responsibilities of a mighty and\r\nextended empire. Her colonies had the name and the advantages, without\r\nthe responsibilities. The parent was sorely pressed and heavily taxed,\r\nto protect the children; the children were becoming so strong and rich\r\nthat they might well be expected to do something for themselves. The\r\nquestion was \"How?\" It is only just to say that when the answer to the\r\nquestion involved the defence of their own soil by their own right hand,\r\nno more eager assistants to the Empire could be found than our American\r\ncolonists. But when they were asked to look beyond their own shores, to\r\ncontribute their share to the maintenance of the Empire elsewhere—\r\nperhaps no bad way of ensuring increased security for themselves—the\r\nanswer was \"No!\" They would shed their blood in defence of their own\r\nplot of ground; but they would not open their purses to assist the\r\ngeneral welfare of the Empire.\r\n\r\nThe colonial difficulty in more recent times has been met by presenting\r\nto the colonies the liberty desired by the old American provinces, but\r\nat the same time throwing on them to a great extent the duty of their\r\nown defence. It is a mere suspension of the difficulty, well enough in\r\ntheory, but which must break down in practice. While the parent has the\r\nsole power of declaring war, and of involving in its area distant\r\nchildren, innocent and ignorant of the cause, she can no more throw off\r\nthe duty of their defence than she can bury herself beneath the waves\r\nthat chafe her coasts. But, for the present, it affords a tolerable\r\ncompromise. In the future, unless our rulers can spare time from the\r\ndiscussion of such petty measures as the Ballot, for the consideration\r\nof a question which involves the national existence, the Colonial\r\nQuestion is as certain again to face us as a difficulty, as it did in\r\n1775. Then, the system which seemed most natural to the rulers of\r\nEngland was to accept the duty of the Empire's defence, but to insist on\r\nthe colonies contributing to the cost. Unwise as this step was, the\r\ncolonies being unrepresented in the Taxing Body, it might have been\r\nborne, had it not interfered with certain vested, although ignoble\r\nrights. The collection of the new revenue required imperial cruisers to\r\nenforce it: and these vessels sorely interfered with the habits and\r\ncustoms of the merchants of Massachusetts, who were the most systematic\r\nsmugglers. With what petty matters are the beginnings of great\r\nrevolutions entwined! The sensuality of Henry VIII. was a means to the\r\nreligious reformation of England: the selfishness of the Boston traders\r\nwas the note which raised in America the thirst for independence. It is\r\nan easy thing to raise a cry which shall at once carry with it the\r\npopulace, and yet smother the real issues. And this was done in Boston.\r\nUp to the commencement of military operations, it is difficult to say\r\nwhich is the least enticing subject for contemplation, the blind,\r\nunreasoning, unaccommodating temper of the English Government, or the\r\nselfish, partisan, ignoble motives of those who were really the prime\r\nmovers of the Revolution, although soon dwarfed and put out of sight by\r\nthe Frankenstein which their cunning had called into existence. It is\r\nalmost a relief to the student, when the sword is drawn: he has then to\r\ndeal with men, not schemers; he has then pictures to gaze at of an\r\nearnest people fighting for independence, or, on the other hand, an\r\noutnumbered army fighting for duty; and he has then such figures to\r\nworship as that purest and noblest in history, George Washington, for\r\nthe proper revelation of whose character the losses of that war's\r\ncontinuance may be counted to all time as a clear gain. What a grim\r\nsatire it reads as one finds this god-like man a puppet in the hands of\r\nthose who were as incapable of understanding his greatness as of\r\nwielding his sword! Wellington in Spain, worried by departmental idiocy\r\nin England, was an object of pity, but his troubles are dwarfed by those\r\nunder which a weaker man than Washington would have resigned in disgust.\r\nIt is pleasant to read of the gallant way in which the Royal Artillery\r\nacquitted itself in the American War: but no encomium from an English\r\nGeneral has greater value than that of Washington, who urged his own\r\nArtillery to emulate that of his enemy: and in all the satisfaction\r\nwhich such praise from Washington, as an enemy, must beget, there is\r\nmingled a feeling of pride that it should have been in a school of war,\r\nwhere Washington was a comrade, instead of an enemy, that he had taken\r\nthe first lessons in the science of which he proved so great a master.\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that the silence of the one country's historians\r\non the subject of the American War is not compensated by the undoubted\r\nloquacity and grandiloquence of the other's. The student is equally\r\nbaffled by the former, and bewildered by the latter. Perhaps the pride\r\nand boasting of the young country is natural: perhaps it was to be\r\nexpected that ere long the fact would be forgotten that without the\r\nassistance of France and Spain to distract England, their independence\r\ncould never have been achieved; but when coupled with this\r\nforgetfulness, comes an exaggeration of petty encounters into high-\r\nsounding battles, and of defeats like that of Bunker's Hill into\r\nsomething like victories, to be celebrated by national monuments, the\r\nstudent may smile complacently at the enthusiasm of the conquerors, but\r\nmust regret the dust which is thrown in his eyes by their boasting and\r\nparty-feeling.\r\n\r\nThere are fortunately two comparatively temperate writers, who were\r\ncontemporary with the war, and took part in it on opposite sides,\r\nStedman and Lee,—the latter being the officer who commanded the\r\ncelebrated Partisan Legion (as it was called), on the American side; and\r\nin endeavouring to arrive at the truth as to the war, the student cannot\r\ndo better than adhere to them.\r\n\r\nThe war, like the siege of Gibraltar, divides itself into epochs. The\r\nfirst, and most northerly, embraces Massachusetts and Canada; the second\r\nconcentrates itself round New York, with the episode of Saratoga; and\r\nthe third and last, derives its main interest from the operations in the\r\nSouth, culminating in the disastrous capitulation of Yorktown. In\r\ntracing the services of the Artillery during the various stages, we\r\nshall have a glimpse of nearly every operation of importance which\r\noccurred during the war.\r\n\r\nAlthough the 4th Battalion was not the only representative of the Royal\r\nArtillery in America during the war—the 1st and 3rd Battalions also\r\nbeing represented—its commanding officers, Colonels Cleaveland and\r\nPattison, who served on the Staff of the Army as Brigadiers, were in\r\ncommand of the Artillery on the Continent; and, therefore, in tracing\r\nthe services of the corps, the records of the 4th Battalion form the\r\nbest groundwork. When hostilities commenced, in Massachusetts, the head-\r\nquarters of the battalion were in Boston. General Gage, who commanded\r\nthe troops, had failed to conciliate the colonial representatives. On\r\nthe 25th February, 1775, he sent a party of infantry and marines to\r\nseize some guns which he understood were in the town of Salem; but on\r\ntheir arrival, they found that the guns had been removed. On the evening\r\nof the 18th April, in the same year, he sent a similar body—about 900\r\nstrong—to the town of Concord on a like errand, and here the first blood\r\nof the war was shed. Great mismanagement was displayed on the part of\r\nthe English commander, and a very decided hostility on the part of the\r\ncolonists, ultimately rendering a retreat necessary. The troops\r\ncommenced retiring on Lexington, under an incessant, although irregular\r\nfire from the militia and peasantry; and luckily, on their arrival at\r\nthat town, they met a reinforcement under Lord Percy, sent to their\r\nassistance, and accompanied by two field-guns. This was the first\r\nappearance of the Royal Artillery in the war. Under the fire of the\r\nguns, the troops were able to continue their retreat comparatively\r\nunmolested; but before they reached Boston, they had sustained a loss of\r\nno less than 273 killed, wounded, and prisoners. This number was\r\nconsidered sufficient to justify the Americans in honouring the\r\nconflicts which occurred, by the high-sounding titles of the \"Battles of\r\nConcord and Lexington.\" Effective as the fire of the English guns was,\r\ncomplaints were made, probably in self-defence, by the commanding\r\nofficer of the troops, that the Artillery were inadequately supplied\r\nwith ammunition on the occasion. A strong remonstrance was immediately\r\naddressed by Colonel Cleaveland to the Master-General of the Ordnance,\r\nstating the true facts. \"I find it has been said in England, that\r\nammunition was wanting for the two guns which went with the Brigade to\r\nLexington—that they had only 24 rounds per gun. I had a waggon with 140\r\nrounds on the parade, and Lord Percy refused to take it, saying it might\r\nretard their march, and that he did not imagine there would be any\r\noccasion for more than was on the side boxes.\"[32]\r\n\r\nOn the 17th June, 1775, the Battle of Bunker's Hill, as it is called,\r\nalthough Breed's Hill was the real scene of operations, (Bunker's Hill,\r\nwhich was intended to be fortified, being considerably more distant from\r\nBoston,) was fought; and in the batteries on Cop's Hill, and with the\r\nguns actually on the field, five companies of the 4th Battalion were\r\npresent—Nos. 1, 2, 4, 5, and 8. Eight field-guns were actually in\r\naction; but twelve accompanied the attacking force—four light 12-\r\npounders, four 5½-inch howitzers, and four light 6-pounders. The attack\r\nwas made under the fire of the guns, \"The troops advancing slowly, and\r\nhalting at intervals to give time for the Artillery to produce some\r\neffect.\"[33] In these words, the recently exploded traditions are\r\napparent, which wedded the Artillery to the infantry during an\r\nengagement, instead of allowing it independent action. One statement is\r\nmade by Stedman, generally a most accurate writer, which it is difficult\r\nto reconcile with Colonel Cleaveland's official report. \"During the\r\nengagement,\" writes the former, \"a supply of ball for the Artillery,\r\nsent from the Ordnance Department in Boston, was found to be of larger\r\ndimensions than fitted the calibres of the field-pieces that accompanied\r\nthe detachment; an oversight which prevented the further use of the\r\nArtillery.\" In opposition to this statement, Colonel Cleaveland's report\r\nto the Master-General may be quoted. \"At Bunker's Hill, I sent sixty-six\r\nrounds to each gun, and not more than half was fired.\"[34] Had the\r\nreason been that given by Stedman, Colonel Cleaveland was too truthful a\r\nman to omit mentioning it. The Battle of Bunker's Hill was the Inkermann\r\nof the American War. The British lost 1054 killed and wounded; the enemy\r\nadmitted a loss of 449. The latter had the advantage of an elevated and\r\nentrenched position; the former fought in heavy marching order—on a hot\r\nsummer day—and had to ascend a steep hill in the face of a heavy and\r\ncontinuous fire. The loss fell most heavily on those who met hand to\r\nhand; the Artillery met with but little casualty. According to the 4th\r\nBattalion records, Captain-Lieutenant Lemoine, Lieutenant Shuttleworth,\r\nand nine matrosses were wounded; according to Colonel Cleaveland's MSS.,\r\nthis number was increased by Captain Huddlestone, whom he includes among\r\nthe wounded.\r\n\r\nThe English plan of attack was faulty, and the defence of the Americans\r\nwas admirable; but these facts merely rendered the victory of the\r\nEnglish troops more creditable. It was a barren victory—perhaps, even,\r\nan injurious one. It did not save Boston from the blockade, which from\r\nthis day became more thorough, and it certainly encouraged the American\r\nmilitia, who found with what effect they could fight against those\r\nregular troops from whom they had hitherto shrunk a little, with a\r\nspecies of superstitious dread.\r\n\r\nBut it was not the less a complete victory, a soldiers' victory, by\r\nsheer hard and close fighting; and, even more, an officers' victory—for\r\nat one time nothing but the energy and gallantry of the officers would\r\nhave rallied the troops, reeling under a tremendous fire.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the rebels or patriots, as they were called\r\nrespectively by enemies and friends, resolved to invade Canada. Nos. 3\r\nand 6 Companies of the 4th Battalion were scattered over the provinces,\r\nand on the lakes, in detachments. On the 3rd May, 1775, a small body of\r\nthe Americans, (who had already possessed themselves of artillery,)\r\nattacked with success Crown Point and Ticonderoga. In November, the\r\nposts of Chambly and St. John were also taken, and with the exception of\r\none officer and eight men, the whole of No. 6 Company was now captive,\r\nand remained so until exchanged on the 7th April, 1777. Two men\r\nbelonging to the company were killed at St. John. The capture of these\r\nposts placed at the disposal of the Americans a quantity of guns,\r\nammunition, and stores, of which they had stood sorely in need: and the\r\nsupply was largely increased by the fortunate capture of an ordnance\r\ntransport from Woolwich, heavily laden with a valuable cargo.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th September, an ill-judged and unsuccessful attack was made on\r\nMontreal by a small force of rebels, in which their commander was taken\r\nprisoner; but later in the year—a more formidable demonstration being\r\nmade by a force under General Montgomery—the Commandant, General\r\nCarleton, withdrew to Quebec: and Montreal fell into the enemy's hands.\r\nPart of No. 3 Company was made prisoner on this occasion.\r\n\r\nThe siege of Quebec was the next episode in the Canadian part of the\r\nwar. It was totally unsuccessful; and the gallant commander of the\r\nAmericans—General Montgomery, who had fought under Wolfe at the same\r\nplace—was killed. The Artillery present in Quebec belonged to No. 3\r\nCompany, 4th Battalion; but they were very few in number. They were\r\nunder the command of Captain Jones, whose services on the occasion\r\nreceived the highest praise. A sort of blockade of the town was kept up\r\nby General Montgomery's successor—Arnold,—but it was indifferently\r\nconducted; and as soon as a man-of-war was able to get up through the\r\nice, General Carleton sallied out and routed the American forces in a\r\nmost thorough manner. Very little more was done in Canada during the\r\nwar. The loyalty of the inhabitants was unmistakable; and it cannot fail\r\nto surprise one who remembers for how very brief a time the French\r\nCanadians had been under British rule. Even later in the war, when the\r\nFrench fleet came to render active assistance to the Americans, and the\r\nAdmiral appealed to the French colonists to rise, his appeal was\r\nunsuccessful. Either the British rule had already become popular,\r\nbecause, on the whole, kind and just; or the sympathies of the French\r\nCanadians—although, perhaps, not with the English—were still more averse\r\nfrom the American cause, which was associated in their minds with the\r\nold New England enemies who had waged with them such an incessant\r\nborder-warfare. The loyalty of Canada is one of the marvels of English\r\nhistory. It seems unalienable, as it certainly is unselfish. Tested,\r\nsixteen years after its conquest, by the great American War; and again\r\nin the present century by the second American War; tried sorely by a too\r\npaternal Colonial Office, which retarded its advancement, its hindrance\r\nmade all the more plain by the spectacle, across the frontier, of the\r\nAmerican Republic attaining a marvellous wealth and development; exposed\r\nto risk from enemies whom it did not know, and in quarrels in which it\r\nhad no share, merely on account of its connection with England;\r\nsuffering, without indemnity, loss of life and of treasure by invasion\r\nfrom lawless banditti, who thought to strike England through her\r\ndependency; chilled by neglect, and depressed by words which, if they\r\nhad any meaning at all, insinuated that she was a burden to the parent,\r\nand half suggested to her to take her leave, and to quit the Empire of\r\nwhich she had been so staunch a member;—tested, tried, endangered,\r\nsuffering, and neglected, the loyalty of Canada remains undimmed. It is,\r\nas has been said, a marvel! Let England take heed that she do not\r\nunderrate this treasure of a people's tried affection.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, while Canada had been invaded by the rebels, their\r\narmy, under Washington, had gradually surrounded Boston, and established\r\na very thorough blockade—causing great hardship and suffering to the\r\ntroops. On the 2nd and 3rd of March, 1776, they established batteries to\r\nthe east and west of the town, which the Royal Artillery vainly\r\nendeavoured for fourteen days to silence; and ultimately it was decided\r\nto evacuate Boston, and retire to Halifax, Nova Scotia, to prepare for\r\nan attack upon New York later in the year, and with large naval and\r\nmilitary reinforcements from England.\r\n\r\nThe evacuation of Boston was conducted in good order, and without loss.\r\nWashington ceased firing on the troops, on receiving notice from the\r\nEnglish general—Howe—that if the bombardment continued, he would set\r\nfire to the town, to cover his retreat; and the men, guns, and stores,\r\nwere placed on board the transports with regularity, and without\r\ninterruption—but not without great labour. Colonel Cleaveland reported\r\nto the Board of Ordnance, that on the evening of the 6th March, 1776, he\r\nhad received orders to use every despatch to embark the Artillery and\r\nstores. \"The transports for the cannon, &c., which were ordered to the\r\nwharf, were without a sailor on board, and half stowed with lumber. At\r\nthe same time, most of my heavy cannon, and all the Field Artillery,\r\nwith a great quantity of ammunition, was to be brought in from\r\nCharleston, and other distant posts. I was also obliged to send iron\r\nordnance to supply their places, to keep up a fire on the enemy, and\r\nprevent their breaking ground on Forster Hill. On the fifth day, most of\r\nthe stores were on board, with the exception of four iron mortars and\r\ntheir beds, weighing near six tons each. With great difficulty I brought\r\nthree of them from the battery, but on getting them on board the\r\ntransport, the blocks gave way, and a mortar fell into the sea, where I\r\nafterwards threw the other two.... Two of my transports were manned with\r\nfour marines, and a few Artillery, who understand something of sailing.\"\r\nThe guns which were left in the town were the oldest, and were left for\r\nuse, if necessary, in covering the final embarkation of the troops. One\r\nhundred and fifty vessels were employed in transporting the army and its\r\nstores to Halifax; and with the army were Nos. 1, 2, 4, 5, and 8\r\nCompanies of the 4th Battalion, Royal Artillery, under Colonel\r\nCleaveland, who, having recently received the Army rank of Colonel,\r\nreceived also now the local rank of Brigadier. During the last few\r\nmonths of his stay in Boston, he had been much occupied in planning the\r\nArtillery share in the coming summer campaign, and in making the\r\nnecessary demands on the authorities at home. He obtained permission to\r\npurchase 700 horses at Halifax and Annapolis; and a remonstrance made by\r\nhim about the \"wretches whom he had to hire as drivers\" at two shillings\r\nper day, succeeded in procuring for him a draft of trained drivers from\r\nEngland. Four companies of the 3rd Battalion had joined before he left\r\nBoston, but not before he was sorely in need of their services, for he\r\nliterally had not a relief for the men whom he had to keep constantly on\r\nduty. Two more companies were ordered from England to the South; four\r\ncompanies under Colonel Phillips were ordered to Canada, to take part\r\nultimately in Burgoyne's wild expedition; and two more were embarked for\r\nservice along the coast in bomb-vessels. A large number of 3-pounders,\r\nmounted on wheel-carriages devised by Captain Congreve, had arrived, and\r\na larger number was promised. They were found infinitely more convenient\r\nthan those Colonel Cleaveland already had, and arranged so as to be\r\ncarried on the backs of horses and mules. Captain Congreve's ingenuity\r\ndisplayed itself in many ways, and called forth repeated expressions and\r\nletters of praise and commendation from Colonel Cleaveland. Doubtless\r\nthe favourable reports made by that officer did much to procure for him—\r\nin 1778—from Lord Townsend, then Master-General of the Ordnance, the new\r\nappointment of Founder and Commandant of the Royal Military Repository.\r\nThe grounds attached to that institution are now used solely for\r\ninstruction in the management of heavy ordnance, but when it was first\r\nopened, the sharp turns and steep inclines in the roads of the\r\nRepository Grounds were made use of in training the drivers to turn and\r\nmanage their horses. Captain Congreve—afterwards Sir William Congreve—\r\nwas a very distinguished and able Artillery officer, but it was not he,\r\nbut his son, who invented the well-known Congreve rocket.\r\n\r\nThe officer who went in command of the companies of Artillery ordered\r\nfor service in the South was Major Innes, an officer who commenced his\r\ncareer as a matross, and ended it as Commandant of the Invalid Battalion\r\nin 1783.\r\n\r\nColonel James commanded the detachments on board the bombs, and was much\r\npraised for the accuracy of his fire at the unsuccessful attack on Fort\r\nSullivan, near Charlestown, South Carolina, in June, 1776. He also\r\ncommenced his career as a matross—in the year 1738—and died as a Colonel\r\nCommandant, in 1782.\r\n\r\nSeveral cadets were sent out to fill vacancies as they might occur,\r\ninstead of promoting non-commissioned officers. While doing duty,\r\nawaiting these vacancies, they received pay as Second Lieutenants.\r\n\r\nAmong the guns sent out for the campaign of 1776 were some light 24-\r\npounders with travelling carriages, some 12-pounders, an immense number\r\nof light 3-pounders with Congreve's carriages, and some mortars for\r\npound-shot. It was intended by the English Government, that this\r\ncampaign should be decisive; and the fleet, army, and Artillery were\r\nvery powerful. Lord Howe commanded the fleet, and his brother commanded\r\nthe army; and they had full powers to treat with the rebels with a view\r\nto a cessation of hostilities, provided they should submit. The army\r\nleft Halifax in June, 1776, and landed on Staten Island on the 3rd July;\r\nthe whole of the Artillery being disembarked by the 7th of the month.\r\nHere they were joined by Sir Henry Clinton's forces from the South, and\r\nby Lord Howe and his fleet from England. A large force of Hessians and\r\nWaldeckers also joined them; and on the 22nd August, the army crossed to\r\nLong Island without molestation. The Americans were encamped at the\r\nnorth end of the island, where the city of Brooklyn now stands—protected\r\nbehind by batteries, on the left by East River, and on the right by a\r\nmarsh. A range of wooded hills separated the two armies, the passes\r\nbeing in the possession of the rebels. On the 27th, the Battle of Long\r\nIsland—or Battle of Brooklyn, as it is indifferently called—was fought.\r\nThe share taken by the Artillery in this victory, was—owing to the\r\nnature of the ground, and the hurried retreat of the Americans within\r\ntheir lines—but small. There were forty guns present: six with Lord\r\nCornwallis's brigade; fourteen with General Clinton in the van; ten with\r\nthe main body under Lord Percy; and four 12-pounders with the 49th\r\nRegiment in rear. The loss consisted of but three killed—Lieutenant\r\nLovell, a sergeant, and a bombardier. So difficult were the 3-pounder\r\nguns on truck carriages found either to be moved or carried, that\r\nBrigadier Cleaveland sent them on board ship, and replaced them with\r\nthose mounted on Congreve's carriages. From the loyalist farmers on Long\r\nIsland, an additional hundred horses were bought for the Artillery, and\r\neighty two-horse waggons, with drivers, hired for the conveyance of\r\nammunition and stores.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest blots on Sir William Howe's generalship was his\r\nomission to follow up the victory he won on Long Island. Had he done so,\r\nhis troops being flushed with victory, and the enemy being disheartened\r\nand disunited, it is possible that he might have put an end to the war.\r\nBy means of his apathy or neglect, Washington's troops were able to\r\ncross over to New York unmolested. Before attacking New York, the\r\nEnglish commander considered it desirable to destroy a very strong\r\nredoubt, at a place called Hell Gate, mounted with a considerable number\r\nof guns to prevent communication, should it be attempted by the British\r\ntroops, from the East River into the Sound. Four batteries were\r\naccordingly erected by the Royal Artillery on the opposite shore,\r\nmounting three 24-pounders, three heavy and three medium 12-pounders,\r\nand ten small mortars. As it eventually happened, the landing of the\r\nBritish in New York was made at a spot where the Hell Gate redoubt would\r\nhave been useless; but it was satisfactory to find, on entering it\r\nafterwards, the enemy's guns dismounted, and the works so shattered,\r\nthat the troops might have marched in with little or no impediment. In\r\nthe Brigadier's report on this occasion, he said, \"The distance was near\r\n700 yards, and though the enemy threw a number of shells from six\r\nmortars, we had only on this occasion two men killed, and one lost an\r\narm. It is with infinite satisfaction that I can say, that whenever the\r\nArtillery is employed, they have not only the approbation of the\r\nCommander-in-Chief, but the whole army, for their behaviour.\"\r\n\r\nThe British landed on Manhattan Island, under the fire of the ships; and\r\nin the precipitate retreat to the heights of Haarlem, the Americans lost\r\ntheir artillery, and many stores, and Washington nearly despaired of\r\never succeeding with such troops as he had under his command. But it was\r\nnot enough to obtain possession of New York, unless the rebel forces\r\ncould be dislodged from the powerful position they occupied in the north\r\nof the island; and to do this, an engagement on no small scale was\r\nnecessary, and was commenced on the 27th October, 1776. Its opening was\r\ncalled the Battle of the White Plains; and viewing it from the Artillery\r\npoint of view, it may be described as follows (bearing in mind that it\r\nwas only the opening scene of a series of engagements, all intimately\r\nconnected, and resulting in the scattering of Washington's forces, their\r\nexpulsion from New York Island, and almost from the Jerseys; the capture\r\nof Forts Washington and Lee, and the complete command of the Lower\r\nHudson):—The attack of the 27th October on the White Plains commenced\r\nwith a cannonade on the enemy's left wing, with nearly thirty guns,\r\nmanned by the Royal Artillery. On the 28th, the attack of the Hessian\r\ntroops was covered by six light 12-pounders; and General Knyphausen\r\npublicly thanked the officers and men who were attached to them. In the\r\nattack on Fort Washington in the beginning of November, the Royal\r\nArtillery had thirty-four guns in action to cover the troops. The Guards\r\nand Light Infantry who were engaged in the attack crossed the East River\r\nin boats under the protection of batteries erected for the purpose. The\r\nhill they had to ascend from their landing was exceedingly rugged and\r\nsteep, and the boats in which they crossed were exposed to the fire of\r\ntwo of the American batteries. To silence these, the batteries above-\r\nmentioned were built, and armed with four medium 12-pounders, fourteen\r\nlight 6-pounders, four howitzers, and two mortars. With this armament,\r\nthe rebel fire was soon silenced, with the exception of one 3-pounder,\r\nwhich was sheltered by a rock, and which did considerable damage. A\r\nbattalion of the rebel forces which was marching for the defence of the\r\nhill was also entirely broken and dispersed by the well-directed fire of\r\nthe Royal Artillery, under which the Guards and Light Infantry landed,\r\nand gained the hill without losing a man. The 42nd Regiment, which\r\nlanded at another place, was covered by four 6-pounders; and six guns\r\nadvanced with Lord Percy, from the lines at New York, and gained the\r\nheights of Haarlem, every gun being engaged. In this attack, the\r\nArtillery is described as having been powerful and well-served; officers\r\nand men received public acknowledgment in General Orders, and from the\r\nMaster-General; and in answering the latter's commendations, Brigadier\r\nCleaveland felt justified in saying: \"The officers and men under my\r\ncommand have shown an unwearied application to the service, and deserve\r\neverything I can say in their favour.... The good opinion your Lordship\r\nis pleased to form of the conduct and superior abilities of the British\r\nArtillery when engaged, does them the highest honour, and I have the\r\npleasure to inform your Lordship, that both officers and men have been\r\nemulous during the course of the campaign in deserving it.\"\r\n\r\nThe attack on the fort was too powerful to be resisted; so it\r\ncapitulated. Lord Cornwallis, with a large body of men immediately\r\ncrossed the North River, to attack Fort Lee, but it was abandoned by its\r\ngarrison on the 18th November, and all the guns and stores fell into the\r\nhands of the English.\r\n\r\nThe English now overran the Jerseys, and the following guns were present\r\nwith the Royal Artillery during the raid: four light 12-pounders,\r\nfourteen 6-pounders, eight 3-pounders, and two 5½-inch howitzers. This\r\nwas a very critical period for the American cause, almost as much so as\r\nafter the Battle of Long Island. \"During these operations, the New York\r\nConvention was greatly alarmed lest the numerous forces (_i.e._\r\nloyalists) of the State should rise in arms, and openly join the British\r\nforces. Often obliged by the movements of the armies to change its\r\nlocality, that body sat successively at Haarlem, King's Bridge, Philip's\r\nManor, Croton River, and Fishkill; some of the time, to guard against\r\nsurprise, with arms in their hands. A committee was appointed for\r\ninquiring into, detecting, and defeating conspiracies. That committee\r\nhad funds at its disposal, a special armed force, and unlimited powers.\r\nMany Tories were seized by its orders and sent into Connecticut for\r\nsafe-keeping, their personal property being forfeited to the use of the\r\nState.... Some of the New York Militia (in Washington's camp) refused to\r\ndo duty. They were offered—they said—peace, liberty, and safety, and\r\nwhat more could they ask.\"[35] While not underrating the energy of a\r\npeople who could attain their end in spite of such difficulties, it is\r\nhealthy reading occasionally, in the midst of flabby orations as to the\r\nuprising of a united people, to examine passages like that just quoted.\r\nA large substratum of loyalty existed yet, which had to be kept down by\r\na sort of reign of terror; and although, as we shall see, the loyal\r\ndiminished greatly in numbers as the war went on, the fact remains that\r\nthe rebellion was not a national conception, but a party manœuvre, which\r\nsecured by dexterous management the assistance of many pure and noble\r\nmen, and ultimately—assisted by war—received the co-operation of the\r\nmass of the people. The war bound the people together by an instinct of\r\nself-defence, apart from the reasons which had brought it about; and\r\nonce committed to a cause, men are as ingenious in inventing, often\r\nunconsciously, arguments in its favour, as they are enthusiastic in\r\ndefending their opinions.\r\n\r\nThe gloom of the American cause in the end of 1776 was brightened by a\r\nsurprise of some German troops at Trenton, by Washington, who took the\r\nwhole prisoners, to the number of about 1000. This success did much to\r\nre-animate the rebels, and gave a new life to their prosecution of the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nThe year 1777 was destined to be the most eventful year of the whole\r\ncampaign. The British had formed a plan, whose aim was as good as its\r\nexecution was foolish. Prior, however, to its commencement, Washington\r\nmade an attack on two regiments, the 17th and 55th, near Princeton,\r\nwhich is described in Brigadier Cleaveland's despatch to the Board of\r\nOrdnance in the following words:—\"The most particular action that has\r\nhappened since Washington's recrossing the Delaware, was an attack made\r\nby him with 4000 men, upon the Battalion of the 17th Regiment at\r\nPrinceton, in which action the 17th has gained great honour, and their\r\nLieutenant-Colonel, Mawhood, great reputation. The heavy fire of the\r\nenemy at the first of the attack obliged the Regiment to retire, under\r\ncover of four 6-pounders advantageously posted. Here the Regiment\r\nformed, and made a general charge upon the enemy, whom they forced\r\nwherever they advanced, leaving a piece of cannon behind them. Colonel\r\nMawhood observing the enemy increasing greatly in their numbers, thought\r\nproper to march from Princeton, where we were obliged to leave two 6-\r\npounders, all the horses belonging to the guns being shot, and the\r\naxletree of the other carriage broke by firing.\" At this affair,\r\nLieutenant Desaguliers, and nine men of the Royal Artillery were killed.\r\nThese active movements of Washington had the effect of making both\r\nGeneral Howe and Lord Cornwallis withdraw their forces from Trenton and\r\nPrinceton, and spend the rest of the winter near New York,—on Long\r\nIsland, and in the neighbouring parts of New Jersey.\r\n\r\nThe plan of operations formed by the British Commanders under\r\ninstructions from home is well and succinctly described by the American\r\nwriter, Lee: \"It contemplated the annihilation of resistance in all the\r\ncountry between the Lakes and Albany; undisturbed possession of the\r\nHudson River (thus severing the Union), and the conquest of\r\nPennsylvania, whose capital (Philadelphia) was the metropolis of the\r\nAmerican States.\" To carry out this plan, it was resolved that one\r\nBritish army should march from Canada, and another from New York, whose\r\nmeeting would complete the separation of the Eastern from the Western\r\nStates, north of New York. Two blunders were committed in this scheme.\r\nThe first was the appointment of General Burgoyne to command the\r\nnorthern force, instead of General Carleton, who was well acquainted\r\nwith the country; the second was the employment of a northern army at\r\nall. New York was in English hands, and the mastery of the sea was as\r\nyet undisputed. Had New York been made the base of operations, and an\r\narmy been sent up the Hudson, with its communications with New York\r\nmaintained by the navy, the separation of the States would have been\r\nassured. But when General Burgoyne with his 7000 men left Canada, and\r\nplunged into the American forest, he cut his communications with the\r\nbase of his operations, and his case became more hopeless every mile he\r\nadvanced. That it was not want of gallantry, but infamous strategy,\r\nwhich brought on the Sedan-like Convention of Saratoga, may be seen by\r\nthe most cursory study, and is eloquently acknowledged in the following\r\nwords by Lee, who, though an enemy, was not blind to the courage of his\r\nopponents:—\"Where is the General who ever more prodigally risked his\r\nlife in his country's cause, than the unfortunate Burgoyne? Where the\r\narmy which more bravely executed its leader's will, than did that which\r\nhe conducted? What danger was avoided? What effort unessayed? What\r\nprivation not submitted to? What difficulties not encountered? But all\r\nterminated in disaster; and the army, from whose prowess so much was\r\nexpected, yielded to its equal in courage, to its superior in number.\"\r\nThe American army, under General Gates, was a little over 13,000 strong;\r\nBurgoyne's force did not exceed 5700|at the date of the capitulation.\r\nThe interest to the Artilleryman, in the details of this expedition, is\r\nunaffected by its disastrous termination. From commencement to\r\ntermination, order-books,[36] despatches, and regimental records, speak\r\nin terms of enthusiasm of the courage of the Artillery, and their\r\ngallant commander—Major-General Phillips—who, although only a Regimental\r\nMajor, held the higher Army rank by brevet, and was second in command of\r\nthe whole force. Of the service of the Artillery at the Battle of\r\nStillwater, Cust, in his 'Annals of the Wars,' writes, \"The Artillery\r\ndid wonders;\"—and of the retreat of the 7th October, the same author\r\nsays, \"Phillips and Riedesel were now ordered to cover the retreat, and\r\nthe troops retired, hard pressed, but in good order; the Artillery,\r\nunder Major Williams, doing good execution, but _all_ the horses having\r\nbeen disabled, six of the guns were obliged to be abandoned.\" Stedman,\r\nin his account of the Battle of Stillwater, says, \"During the action,\r\nMajor-General Phillips contrived to convey through a thick part of the\r\nwood, some British Artillery, which was of essential service. Captain\r\nJones of this corps, who fell in this action, was particularly\r\ndistinguished.\" But the most valuable comment is that made by General\r\nPhillips himself, after the termination of the campaign; in a report\r\nmade by him from Albany on the 22nd October, 1777, to Lords Townsend and\r\nAmherst. \"I have to report to you, my Lords, that the Corps of Artillery\r\nwhich I commanded has acted during the campaign with the greatest\r\nspirit, and has received the entire approbation of General Burgoyne, and\r\nthe applause of the army. In the action of the 19th September, the\r\nArtillery was of infinite use; and a brigade commanded by Captain Jones,\r\nwith Lieutenants Hadden and Reid, was particularly engaged, and\r\nmaintained their post to the last, although in doing of it _every man,\r\nexcept five, was either killed or wounded_. Captain Jones was killed.\r\n\r\n\"In the affair of October 7th, Major Williams kept a battery in action,\r\nuntil the Artillery horses were all destroyed, and his men either killed\r\nor wounded; being unable to get off their guns, he was surrounded and\r\ntaken, with two officers, Lieutenants York and Howorth, the latter\r\nwounded. Captain Blomefield, my Major of Brigade, was also wounded on\r\nthe 7th instant, at Major Williams' battery. I cannot sufficiently\r\ncommend the activity, zeal, and spirit of the officers. The same gallant\r\nspirit remained to the last day, when the Convention was signed. I had\r\nthe honour to deliver a message to the Lieutenant-General from the Corps\r\nof Artillery, that they were as ready as ever to undergo any hardships,\r\nor to undertake any difficulties, for the King's service. Under this\r\ndescription, allow me to recommend the corps to your Lordship's\r\nprotection, and humbly request that you will represent their conduct to\r\nHis Majesty.\" The men of the Irish Artillery, who were referred to in a\r\nformer chapter as having taken part in the American War, formed part of\r\nthe force under General Phillips, and it was to their conduct during\r\nthis expedition that allusion was made by the Master-General in the\r\ndespatch there quoted.\r\n\r\nThe story of this disastrous expedition is short and simple. Having left\r\nhis Canadian quarters in June, Burgoyne invested Ticonderoga on the 1st\r\nJuly, captured it on the 6th, pursued the flying garrison with gunboats\r\non the lakes, as well as in forced marches by land, and utterly\r\nscattered them. Leaving the lakes in the end of July, he marched for the\r\nHudson; but as he already felt the want of supplies, it was the 13th of\r\nSeptember before he crossed that river, and took up his position at\r\nSaratoga. On the 19th September, the Battle of Stillwater was fought—in\r\nwhich the English were left masters of the field—the 9th, 20th, 21st,\r\n24th, 47th, and 62nd Regiments being engaged, and behaving with the\r\ngreatest valour. On the 7th of October, a forward movement made by\r\nBurgoyne was defeated, and it was during his retreat on that day that—as\r\nstated above—Major Williams' battery behaved so well. Affairs were now\r\ndesperate: the Indians were deserting, and the enemy increasing in\r\nnumbers every day; supplies of all sorts were short, nor was there any\r\nmeans of obtaining them; the actually effective British troops did not\r\nexceed 3500; and there was an opposing force, said to amount to 16,000\r\nmen: there was no appearance of the long-expected army from New York\r\nunder Sir Henry Clinton; and even if Burgoyne succeeded in retreating to\r\nCanada, he might greatly embarrass Clinton, by enabling Gates' and\r\nWashington's armies to unite; but retreat became soon impossible. At\r\nlast, with only three days' provisions left, he opened negotiations with\r\nGeneral Gates, and on the 17th the Convention was signed, and this wild,\r\nbaseless expedition met its natural and disastrous termination.\r\n\r\nThis was the signal in Europe for action among England's enemies. From\r\nthis day, France and Spain made no secret of their resolution to join\r\nthe Americans; and to this extraneous evil was added the indignation of\r\nthe English people with the Government. Even those who opposed the war\r\nwere indignant with the authorities: ready critics, although backward in\r\nassistance. The affair at Trenton was more valuable, as far as the\r\nAmericans themselves were concerned: it came at a time of great\r\ndepression, and reanimated their drooping spirits: but as far as other\r\nnations could judge, the surrender of Burgoyne was most important, and\r\ndecided two at least to take an active instead of a passive share in the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nBut in the mean time what were the troops doing at New York? And in the\r\nfirst place, what were Colonel Cleaveland, and the companies under his\r\ncommand, doing? They were becoming sadly diminished in numbers, and the\r\ntheme of all Colonel Cleaveland's letters was the same—a cry for more\r\nmen from England. \"The demand for Artillerymen,\" he wrote \"is so great\r\nthat the smallest body of infantry wish not to move without them. I must\r\ntherefore entreat your Lordship to give us every possible addition to\r\nour Corps.... From the small number of Artillerymen in quarters, and no\r\nassistance to be had from the army, I am obliged to hire seamen to act\r\nas labourers, and find they do more work than any other men I can\r\nemploy.\"\r\n\r\nAt the very time he was writing thus, he was being pressed by the\r\nCommander-in-Chief to increase the number of guns for the field during\r\nthe summer campaign; to form batteries of iron 24-pounders and brass 12-\r\npounders on travelling carriages; and to buy as many horses as he could,\r\ninstead of trusting to those which were pressed for service as required.\r\nHis patience and the wants of the army being unable to wait for the\r\ndeliberate movements of the English Ordnance officials, he at last\r\nobtained permission from the Commander-in-Chief to enlist three hundred\r\nmen in New York, \"although,\" he wrote, \"these will be very insufficient\r\nto man the cannon for the field,—and we therefore most ardently wish for\r\nmore Artillery from England.\" He clothed the recruits with the last\r\nyear's clothing for the 4th Battalion, demanding an additional supply\r\nfrom England in its room. By the correspondence of this time, it appears\r\nthat the men had no greatcoats except a few for use on sentry, which\r\nwere kept in the guard rooms. The severity of the winter made it\r\nnecessary to demand a supply, as the men were much exposed. This appeal\r\nwas made in the year 1777, and was granted in the year 1786—the matter\r\nhaving taken nine years to penetrate the official brain. Even then it\r\nwas only granted in part—to the extent of ten per company, increased two\r\nyears later to fifteen, as the idea became more comprehended by the\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\nBy the 1st of June, 1777, an extra supply of four hundred horses was\r\nobtained; the batteries were all ready, and by the middle of the month\r\nthe campaign commenced. The object of Sir William Howe was to draw off\r\nWashington from a strong position which he held, enabling him to prevent\r\nhis opponents from rendering assistance to Burgoyne, and also from\r\nadvancing on Philadelphia. Every feint was attempted without success;\r\nand at last the British General resolved on a genuine invasion of some\r\npart south of New York, which would compel Washington to move. During\r\nthe month of June, only one engagement of any importance took place, at\r\nWestfield, between the British under Lord Cornwallis and 3000 Americans\r\nunder Lord Stirling, in which the latter were defeated with a loss of\r\nthree guns. At this action, the detachments of Artillery who were\r\npresent belonged to the 4th Battalion. By the way, a peculiar service\r\nfor the Royal Artillery to perform is mentioned by Stedman as having\r\nbeen carried out on the 6th July in this year. \"The American galleys\r\nwere destroyed near Skenesborough during Burgoyne's expedition by\r\nCaptain Carter, of the Artillery, who commanded a Brigade of _gunboats_.\r\nHe gave chase, and pursued them with such speed, that he captured\r\nseveral of their largest galleys, and obliged them to set the remainder\r\non fire with a considerable number of their bateaux.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd July 1777, Sir William Howe embarked his army—leaving Sir\r\nHenry Clinton in command at New York—and sailed for the south. Until the\r\n22nd August he kept his intended destination a secret, and baffled\r\nWashington's speculations, but on that day news came that he had entered\r\nChesapeake Bay, so the American General marched to meet him. On the 25th\r\nAugust Howe disembarked his troops, and marched inland. To prevent the\r\nEnglish reaching Philadelphia, the Americans who had been within a very\r\nfew miles of their enemies, fell back, and occupied the heights beyond\r\nthe Brandywine river. On the 11th, the English attacked the American\r\nposition, moving in two columns, one under Lord Cornwallis, the other\r\nunder General Knyphausen. The former column crossed the river at an\r\nunexpected point, and mounting the hill under a heavy protecting fire of\r\nArtillery drove the Americans into the woods. General Knyphausen had\r\nsome severe fighting also, and ultimately succeeded in getting across.\r\n\r\nThis was the Battle of Brandywine, in which the Americans admitted a\r\nloss of 300 killed, 600 wounded, and 400 prisoners, besides 11 pieces of\r\nArtillery. The English had 8 officers and 74 men killed, and a little\r\nover 400 wounded. The Royal Artillery lost 5 killed—Lieutenant Shand, 2\r\nsergeants, and 9 rank and file wounded. A small engagement, equally\r\nfavourable to the British, and in which the 42nd and 44th Regiments\r\ngreatly distinguished themselves, took place on the 18th September, and\r\non the 25th Lord Cornwallis took possession of Philadelphia. Writing\r\nfrom that city on the 28th November to Lord Germaine, Sir William Howe\r\nsaid, \"Much credit is due to Brigadier-General Cleaveland and to the\r\nofficers and men of the Corps of Artillery.\"\r\n\r\nWhile in Philadelphia, Brigadier Cleaveland heard that he was to be\r\nsuperseded by Brigadier Pattison who had been appointed to the 4th\r\nBattalion _vice_ Colonel Ord, who had died in the preceding April. The\r\nfirst time that General Pattison is mentioned as having taken active\r\npart in the war was on the 22nd October, 1777, when the British troops\r\ntook possession of the Fort of Red Back—on which occasion he commanded\r\nthe Artillery: but General Cleaveland had not ceased to do duty, for he\r\ncommanded the Artillery at the successful attack on Mud Island on the\r\n16th November, an attack which succeeded in \"removing all the obstacles\r\nto the free navigation of the Delaware by the British fleet.\"[37]\r\n\r\nAfter Lord Cornwallis had entered Philadelphia, and while the great body\r\nof the British troops were encamped under Sir William Howe, at a village\r\ncalled Germantown, about six miles from Philadelphia, Washington made a\r\nsudden attack upon them early in the morning of the 4th October.\r\nAlthough at first successful, it did not long continue so. Failure of\r\npunctual co-operation, according to Lee's account, and the brave stand\r\nmade by the 40th Regiment, soon changed the current of events: and\r\nWashington was ultimately obliged to retire with a loss of at least 1000\r\nkilled, wounded, and prisoners. In speculating on the causes of this\r\ndefeat, Lee uses language such as few other American writers would use,\r\nand such as few living Americans would care to hear. But it is perhaps\r\nall the more valuable. \"The defeat must be attributed,\" he says, \"to the\r\nyet imperfect discipline of the American army: to the broken spirit of\r\nthe troops, who, from day to day, and from month to month, had been\r\nsubjected to the most trying and strength-wasting privations, through\r\nthe improvidence or inability of Government: to the inexperience of the\r\ntribe of generals, and to the complication of the plan of assault—a\r\ncomplication said to have been unavoidable.\"\r\n\r\nIt was before superior numbers that the British evacuated Boston: to\r\nsuperior numbers Burgoyne surrendered at Saratoga: and now the\r\nsuperiority of numbers being in the other direction, the Americans were\r\ndefeated in every action during this part of the campaign. Defeated,\r\nbut, it must be admitted, not disheartened, for the losses round\r\nPhiladelphia were forgotten in the blaze of triumph which accompanied\r\nthe capitulation of Burgoyne's force; and the growing intensity of the\r\nAmerican feeling will be realized from a letter, which will be quoted in\r\nthe next chapter, written in the very place where their losses must have\r\nbeen most palpably real.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to throw up field-works round the British camp, which\r\nafter the battle of Germantown was brought nearer Philadelphia, and also\r\nto erect works to secure the command of the river. The Artillerymen were\r\nlargely employed in building and arming these; and one of them was the\r\nscene of a gallant action on the part of a detachment, which is\r\nmentioned both by Stedman and Lee, and also appears in the MS. Record\r\nBook of the 4th Battalion. According to the last-mentioned authority,\r\nsome detachments of Nos. 4, 5, and 8 Companies were employed in\r\nconstructing batteries on Provence Island, in the Delaware, for the\r\nreduction of an American post on Mud Island, when a party of the 10th\r\nRegiment, under Major Vatap, which covered the works, abandoned them on\r\nthe advance of the enemy, and the whole of the guns fell into their\r\nhands, but owing to the gallantry of the detachment of Artillery, the\r\nenemy was obliged to retire, the guns were retaken, and the batteries\r\nagain occupied. Stedman in telling this circumstance mentions that the\r\nArtillerymen were under the command of a subaltern, to whose gallantry\r\nthe recapture of the batteries was due: and Lee adds, \"I believe this\r\nconduct of Major Vatap (who abandoned most shamefully the Artillery) is\r\nthe single instance of dastardly conduct among the British officers\r\nduring the war.\"\r\n\r\nSir William Howe spent the winter at Philadelphia with his army—of which\r\neight companies of the Royal Artillery formed part. The same hesitation\r\nor dilatory disposition which prevented him following up his successes\r\non Long Island induced him to spend many valuable months in idleness\r\nnow. France and America had now formed an alliance, and it was very\r\nimportant that energetic action should be taken by the British troops in\r\nAmerica before the arrival of the French fleet. But the opportunity was\r\nlost by the supineness of Sir William Howe; and although he was a man\r\nwho had endeared himself to his troops, there can be no doubt that when\r\nhe resigned the command in May, 1778, and was succeeded by Sir Henry\r\nClinton, he was replaced by one who was equal to him as a soldier, and\r\nfar superior in energy and activity. The first step taken by the new\r\ncommander was to evacuate Philadelphia, and withdraw the army to New\r\nYork. Every difficulty was thrown in his way by Washington, and a severe\r\nand indecisive engagement was fought during his retreat, which is known\r\nas the Battle of Monmouth or of Freehold Court-house. Both sides claimed\r\nthe victory, but as Clinton's movement towards New York was not\r\ninterrupted by it, it may be inferred that he had not the worst of the\r\nencounter. Four companies of the Artillery were engaged, and their fire\r\nwas true and severe: one officer, Lieutenant T. L. Vaughan, was killed.\r\nOn the 30th June, the English army reached Sandyhook, where they found\r\nLord Howe's fleet; and early in July they passed over to New York. The\r\nconduct of the Artillery during the return from Philadelphia to New York\r\nmay be learnt from the following order, issued by General Pattison:—\"The\r\nvery handsome and obliging terms in which the General Officers and\r\nothers have repeatedly spoken of the appearance, discipline, and good\r\norder of the Corps of Artillery, and particularly of the conduct, care\r\nand attention of all the officers who have been detached with the\r\nseveral Brigades and Battalion guns, cannot fail to be highly pleasing\r\nand satisfactory to the Brigadier-General. He therefore takes this\r\noccasion to give them his best thanks, and to express further his entire\r\napprobation of the regularity and observance of duties that have been\r\nshown by all ranks during the late march, and of the cheerfulness and\r\nalacrity with which they have undergone the great fatigue of it.\"\r\n\r\nDuring this retreat from Philadelphia, the Artillerymen were for the\r\nfirst time relieved of carrying their knapsacks and ammunition pouches,\r\nwhich were carried for them on the waggons. They carried their arms,\r\nexcept when actually fighting their guns, and had six cartridges in a\r\nsmall bag in their pockets.\r\n\r\nA short summary of the occasions in 1778, after the evacuation of\r\nPhiladelphia, when individual Artillerymen distinguished themselves, may\r\nbe extracted from the pages of that most conscientiously and laboriously\r\nwritten work, Browne's 'England's Artillerymen;' with any requisite\r\nadditions from other sources.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1778, Rhode Island was attacked by the American General\r\nSullivan, supported by the French fleet. The island was garrisoned by\r\n5000 British troops under Sir Robert Pigott, including a company of the\r\nRoyal Artillery under the command of Lieut.-Colonel John Innes, an\r\nofficer who, as has already been mentioned, commenced his career as a\r\nmatross in 1736, and died in 1783, in command of the Invalid Battalion.\r\nThe severe labour and exposure cheerfully undergone by the Artillery on\r\nthis occasion were specially mentioned by Sir Robert in his despatches\r\nannouncing the total defeat of the American scheme. The loss of the\r\nArtillery amounted to thirty-three killed and wounded. In September,\r\n1778, General Grey sailed for Bedford, to destroy a nest of privateers,\r\nand was accompanied by some Artillery under Captain Scott, who blew up\r\nthe American fort. In November a body of troops, with a detachment of\r\nArtillery under Lieutenant Ralph Wilson, sailed for Savannah in Georgia,\r\na place which was speedily taken. From General Pattison's letter-books,\r\nit is easy to see that this operation gave great satisfaction in New\r\nYork: considerable stores were taken; and the province of Georgia\r\nreduced. An officer of the Royal Artillery bearing the same surname as\r\nhe who commanded at Rhode Island, Lieut.-Colonel Alexander Innes, was\r\nmade Governor of Savannah, and afterwards sent home to the King with\r\ndespatches. He had greatly distinguished himself during the attack.\r\n\r\nThis was the last operation of any consequence in 1778. The Army\r\nremained concentrated at New York, and the prisoners of war who had been\r\ntaken by the Americans at Burgoyne's capitulation remained prisoners\r\nstill. A few of the officers had been exchanged for American officers;\r\nand, in this way, General Phillips, of the Artillery, ultimately became\r\navailable for duty. General Pattison, who still commanded the Artillery,\r\nand was with the head-quarters of the army, received a special mark of\r\nfavour from Sir Henry Clinton in July, 1779, being appointed Commandant\r\nof the City and Garrison of New York. It may not be uninteresting to the\r\nreader to learn what sort of place New York was in 1779, under a\r\ngunner's government, and an attempt to describe it will now be made.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 32:\r\n\r\n  MSS.

It was their boast afterwards that forty-two thousand\r\nbullets were made out of King George's statue to fire at King George's\r\nsoldiers. But although the mob ran riot in the city on that day, it must\r\nnot be imagined that there was no loyalty in New York. There was, among\r\nall the respectable classes, a feeling of shame and sadness, which\r\nshowed itself in the closed churches and darkened windows, and, later\r\non, in the joyous welcome which the British troops enabled them openly\r\nto give to the representatives of the British connection. New York, for\r\nmany reasons, was more loyal than any other part of the revolted\r\ncolonies, and there were many opportunities of displaying this in the\r\nperiod of its occupation by the British forces,—an occupation which,\r\ncommencing in 1776, continued uninterruptedly for over seven years,\r\nuntil the war was at an end, and the colonies were lost.\r\n\r\nNear this Bowling Green lived, during the British occupation, most of\r\nthe military officials; and among others, in the years 1779 and 1780,\r\nlived James Pattison, Colonel in the Royal Artillery, Major-General in\r\nHis Majesty's forces in America, and Commandant of the City and Garrison\r\nof New York. And the narrative of James Pattison's life is one which\r\nmust occupy a very prominent place in a History of the Regiment to which\r\nhe belonged.\r\n\r\nHe was the second son of a merchant in London, who owned the estate at\r\nWoolwich and Plumstead, known as the Burrage Estate. He married a\r\ndaughter of the celebrated Albert Borgard, and was repeatedly selected\r\nfor appointments requiring great tact and firmness, two qualities which\r\nhe possessed in an eminent degree. Among others, he was, as a\r\nLieutenant-Colonel, appointed Lieutenant-Governor of the Royal Military\r\nAcademy, and did more than any of his predecessors, or most of those who\r\nhave succeeded him, to introduce a proper discipline among the Cadets\r\nand their instructors, while, at the same time, he raised the tone of\r\nthe institution, and asserted, to an unheard-of extent, its independence\r\nof the authorities of the Woolwich garrison.\r\n\r\nHe served with distinction in Flanders, and at the end of the Seven\r\nYears' War he was chosen to command the companies selected for service\r\nin Portugal. When so employed, he won the respect of all by his\r\ndignified firmness and courtesy, and laid the foundation of an affection\r\ntowards himself from the officers serving under him which never even\r\nwaned. On his staff in Portugal was a subaltern bearing a name honoured\r\nthen as now in the Artillery,—Adye. Lieutenant S. P. Adye was\r\nafterwards, as a Captain-Lieutenant, aide-de-camp to General Pattison\r\nwhen in command of the Royal Artillery in New York, and was a most able\r\nand energetic staff officer.\r\n\r\nIn 1769 Colonel Pattison was sent to Venice to superintend the\r\norganization of the Venetian Artillery. From private letters, which are\r\nstill in existence, it would appear that he had a very difficult task,\r\nnot so much with the Artillerymen as with the authorities, who were\r\ndisposed to break faith with him. But as he simply threatened to resign\r\nif they did not keep their promises, he obtained what he wanted; and it\r\nmay be said of James Pattison that he never wanted more than justice.\r\n\r\nGeneral Pattison, as has already been mentioned, succeeded Colonel\r\nCleaveland in the command of the Fourth Battalion of the Royal Artillery\r\nin America. He succeeded one who was a soldier, but no statesman,—who\r\nconceived that the utmost expected of him was to despise and defeat any\r\nenemy who might be opposed to him. General Pattison was equally sensible\r\nof his duty as far as military operations were concerned; but he went\r\nbeyond his predecessor in the liberal and statesmanlike views he took of\r\nthe state of America. In his official reports, it is needless to say, he\r\ndid not enter into details beyond his province; but his private\r\ncorrespondence is a mine of wealth to the student of the great American\r\nWar, and it has been placed at the disposal of the compiler of this work\r\nby the representatives of the family. The following letter is a\r\ndispassionate and valuable contribution to the history of those stirring\r\ntimes, and reveals at once the able character of the writer and the\r\nstate of the American Colonies. In writing to his brother from\r\nPhiladelphia, in December, 1777, he says:\r\n\r\n\"I wish it was in my power to give you very pleasing accounts of the\r\nstate of affairs in this distracted country; but, indeed, it is almost a\r\ndistracting consideration for anyone who knows them, as we do by\r\n_experience_, to think of them. Ministers have been deceived, and have\r\nnever known the true state of this country; if they had, they never\r\nwould have entered into a war with it. I own I had very mistaken notions\r\nmyself when in England of reducing America to obedience by conquest. I\r\nhave totally changed my sentiments, not that I would wish them to be\r\nknown but to yourself, as it might not be prudent for me to declare\r\nthem; but I will confess to _you_ that, by what I have seen and heard, I\r\nam fully of opinion that all the efforts Great Britain can make will\r\nnever effectually conquer this great continent, in which,\r\nnotwithstanding all that has been said of _friends_ to Government here,\r\nand _friends_ to Government there, yet there is scarcely one to be met\r\nwith from one end of it to the other. We have not only armies to combat\r\nwith, but a whole country, where every man, woman, and even child is\r\nyour enemy, and, in fact, do in one shape or another act as such. One\r\nRoyal Army has been already obliged to do what is not in our History to\r\nbe met with,—to lay down their arms, and surrender prisoners of war;\r\nanother Army at New York in a state of alarm; and the Grand Army here\r\npenned up within the narrow limits of two or three miles, and cut off\r\nfrom all provisions, but what must be gained by fighting for with large\r\nforaging parties sent out from time to time for that purpose. In short,\r\nunless thirty thousand men more, added to the thirty thousand we already\r\nhave, can be sent hither early in the year, the wisest thing would be to\r\nget rid of the contest in the best manner you can, and, if it was\r\npossible to persuade them to revoke their Declaration of Independence,\r\nthen to make one general Act of Oblivion—give up entirely the point of\r\ntaxation, and restore the whole country to the state it was in 1763.\r\nThese are my politics, though I would not wish them to be known. I am\r\nmuch afraid the prosecution of the war must prove ruinous and\r\ndestructive to Great Britain.\"\r\n\r\nThese words have a special value, as coming from one whose official\r\nposition in command of the Artillery gave him favourable opportunities\r\nfor forming an opinion. Happily, among British officers, opinions never\r\ninterfere with the performance of duties, however hopeless; and it will\r\nbe found that no one was more energetic than General Pattison, both at\r\nPhiladelphia and in his command at New York. At the same time, we learn\r\nfrom this letter three things—the success of the cry against England\r\ncommenced in Massachusetts, and swollen by hasty and foolish treatment\r\non the part of England; the falsehood of the Government statements at\r\nhome; and the great difficulties which embarrassed the English Army in\r\nits operations, even thus early in the war.\r\n\r\nBut in this chapter the condition of New York during the British\r\noccupation is the subject of consideration; and perhaps it cannot be\r\nbetter realized than by imagining oneself in the company of the gallant\r\nGeneral, as he went his daily rounds. Hanging about in the vicinity of\r\nhis house are orderlies, in different costume; the gunner, in full\r\ndress, with his gold-laced cocked-hat, with _black_ feather, as was the\r\ncustom then in the 4th Battalion, his hair clubbed and powdered, white\r\nstock, white breeches, and white stockings, and armed with a carbine and\r\na bayonet; or, perhaps, in the marvellous undress invented for the\r\nBattalion by Colonel Cleaveland—a blue jacket and brown trousers. Among\r\nthe others is also to be seen an occasional negro, in no particular\r\nuniform at all, one of a company of Virginian blacks enrolled for duty\r\nwith the Artillery and in the Ordnance Yard. In the recent American\r\nCivil War many hard things were said of the Northerners for declaring\r\nthe slaves of the rebels to be free, at a time when the women and\r\nchildren of the South were in their homes alone and unprotected. It is\r\nbut fair to say that the example followed was our own. During the War of\r\nIndependence the same course towards the rebels was taken by the\r\nBritish, and an influx of runaway slaves in New York was the result.\r\nThis, coupled with the decided immigration of Loyalists from other\r\ndistricts, accounts for the great rise in the population of New York\r\nduring the British occupation, which increased from 17,000 to 30,000.\r\nThe newspapers of the time teem with advertisements announcing the sale\r\nof slaves, but from the fact above mentioned it is evident that they can\r\nonly apply to the slaves of Loyalists. Some of them are so grotesque as\r\nto be worthy of reproduction:\r\n\r\n\"To be sold, a strong, healthy mulatto girl, about fifteen years of age.\r\nHas been used to household work and the care of children. She has both\r\nhad the small-pox and the measles. For further particulars, apply to Mr.\r\nStevens, _Livery Stable Keeper_, Little Queen-street.\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sold, a young negro wench, who has had the small-pox, can cook\r\nvery well, nineteen years old, and sold for no fault. Lowest price,\r\n70_l._\"\r\n\r\nAnd—\"For sale, a fine negro boy and a billiard-table.\"\r\n\r\nDoubtless, if one looked in at the places of auction, the poor girl \"who\r\nis accustomed to the care of children\" would be found crying her heart\r\nout, while thinking of the charge from which she has been torn, and\r\ndreading the unknown future before her; while poor little Sambo would be\r\nseen showing his white teeth over the table which has been the dusky\r\nmarker's little world, and from which he has found that he is not to be\r\nseparated.\r\n\r\nThe newspapers of the time, in which the above advertisements appear,\r\nare an interesting study. From them one gets an admirable picture of the\r\ncity during the British occupation—of the business, amusements, and\r\ndaily routine. One is soon reminded that New York was under martial law.\r\nThe statute price of the loaf always headed the column, by order of the\r\nMajor-General commanding, followed by terrible threats against the\r\nfarmers on Long Island if they did not bring their hay, without further\r\ndelay, to the city for sale. Notices to the refugees from rebel\r\ndistricts, informing them where they could obtain work, were regularly\r\ninserted, for the Commandant would have no idlers in the place.\r\nAuthority for lotteries was occasionally notified, the proceeds to go to\r\nthe aged and invalid poor; and theatrical advertisements were frequent.\r\n\r\nThe Garrison Dramatic Club, whose profits went to assist the soldiers'\r\nwives, was composed of officers of the Garrison, who were assisted in\r\ntheir performances by young ladies—daughters of New York merchants—whose\r\nparts were played, according to the critics of the time, \"with great\r\npropriety, spirit, and accuracy.\" The receipts of the Club in one year,\r\namounted to 9,500_l._, all of which, after deducting unavoidable\r\nexpenses, was spent in charity.\r\n\r\nThe rules of the theatre were somewhat arbitrary. Not merely had the\r\nplaces to be secured and paid for before the day of performance, but the\r\ntakers were compelled to send their servants at half-past four in the\r\nafternoon to keep their seats until the curtain rose at seven. It must\r\nhave been a ludicrous sight during these two hours and a half—that dusky\r\naudience with nothing to hear, those crowded spectators with nothing to\r\nsee.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief actors in the club was Major Williams, of the\r\nArtillery, who was also Brigade-Major of the Garrison. In the Library of\r\nthe Historical Society in New York there is yet to be found frequent and\r\nfavourable mention of this officer's rendering of Macbeth and Richard\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nPossibly an undue value may easily be attached to the opinions of an\r\naudience which was, doubtless, more or less, composed of the actors'\r\nfriends; but it has been recorded that nothing was so popular,—no wit,\r\nhumour, or buffoonery so welcome, even to the gallery,—as hits at the\r\nrebels during the performance.\r\n\r\nThe newspapers of the day were the 'Mercury,' published on Monday;\r\n'Robertson's Loyal American Gazette,' on Thursday; and the 'General\r\nAdvertiser,' on Friday. But there was one more reliable, and more\r\ngenerally read, than any of these,—the 'Gazette,' published every\r\nWednesday and Saturday, by a man called Rivington, famed for his\r\nhospitality and as a _bon vivant_, but who proved eventually to be a\r\ntraitor. About 1781 he began to see that, under the influence of the\r\nFrench Alliance and dissension in England, the rebel cause was\r\nbrightening. While, therefore, still continuing to utter the most loyal\r\nsentiments in his journal, he supplied the enemy, in rather an ingenious\r\nway, with all the latest intelligence. Being a bookbinder as well as\r\npublisher, and being wholly unsuspected, he was permitted to send books\r\nto the Jerseys and elsewhere for sale. In the binding of the books were\r\nconcealed despatches for Washington, who was thus supplied with the\r\nlatest news from New York and England.\r\n\r\nFrom advertisements in the various newspapers, the price of tea during\r\nthe British occupation would appear to have averaged 18_s._ per lb.;\r\ncorn varied with the punctuality or otherwise of the convoys from\r\nIreland,—a strange thing to read of in days when America is known as the\r\ngrain-producing country of the world; and claret, from some reason or\r\nother, was cheap and plentiful. There are, in the Royal Artillery Record\r\nOffice, permit-books of General Pattison's from which the filial\r\naffection of the subalterns in the Garrison can be gauged by the amount\r\nof claret they received permission to send from New York to their\r\nanxious parents.\r\n\r\nBut, returning to No. 1 Broadway, on the Bowling Green, where the\r\nGeneral lived, let the reader accompany him on his rounds. His chestnut\r\nhorse is at the door, and Captain Adye and Captain-Lieutenant Ford, his\r\nQuartermaster, are waiting for him. The house in which he lives was\r\nformerly occupied by Sir Henry Clinton, now the Commander of the Forces,\r\nand afterwards by General Robertson, the immediate predecessor of\r\nGeneral Pattison as Commandant of New York. The next house, No. 3\r\nBroadway, had been occupied by Sir William Howe, on the first occupation\r\nof New York by the English forces in 1776, and was destined to be the\r\nresidence of the arch-renegade, Arnold.\r\n\r\nThe General is a wiry, muscular man, of about fifty-four years of age;—\r\nhis staff were mere boys, and yet he outlived them both. The\r\ncharacteristic which struck every one most was his courtly urbanity:\r\nevery hat which was raised by passers-by was courteously acknowledged;\r\nand for every one whom he knew there was a pleasant, kindly word. He\r\nlooks even brighter and more cheery this morning than usual, and,\r\njudging from the barely-suppressed merriment of his staff—when he is not\r\nlooking—there is evidently some cause for cheerfulness. The joke is\r\nthis. If James Pattison excels in one thing more than another, it is in\r\ncorrespondence. Last night had found him in a good vein, and his staff\r\nare still chuckling over some letters which they had copied this\r\nmorning. Let three be selected, with a judicious blending of love and\r\nwar, and let preference be given to the first. The General was, in the\r\nstrongest and most benevolent sense, a father to his officers; there was\r\nno one in whose affairs he was not ready to take an interest; and his\r\nsympathy with all under his command is visible in every line of his\r\ncorrespondence. As the student sits among his letter-books, in the\r\nDryasdust Record Offices looking out on the muddy Thames, there are\r\ntimes when, out of the yellow pages and faded writing, there seems to\r\nshape itself a figure, which, even at this distance of time, has such a\r\nloveable reality about it, that he seems to have known it as a dear\r\nfriend. In return for the interest the General felt in and showed for\r\nhis officers, he asked but one thing—their confidence; and the extent of\r\nhis private correspondence shows that he did not ask in vain.\r\n\r\nBut there had been an exception,—unconscious, perhaps, but not\r\nunnoticed. A giddy subaltern had fallen in love. The General hardly\r\nexpected to be told of this. In those days, as now, it might be\r\npredicated of subalterns that \"'tis their nature to!\" But this youth\r\nresolved to marry, and did not tell his resolution. He was away in\r\nFlorida; there were no regular posts; perhaps the General might not\r\napprove of it; and, besides, those sweet hours of bliss were too dear to\r\nbe interrupted by extraneous correspondence. So he was married. At first\r\nall was happiness. Love was still in every room of the cottage; and the\r\nGeneral, like everything else, was forgotten. But there came a day when,\r\nin that little cottage, there were \"Rooms to let,\" for Love had taken\r\numbrage at a threadbare ruffian, called Poverty, who had taken up his\r\nabode. So, like the Prodigal Son in the Parable, the mournful subaltern\r\nremembered his General, and, writing a doleful letter as to the expenses\r\nof the married state, suggested a happy arrangement by which his income\r\nmight be improved. To which the General had overnight penned the\r\nfollowing reply. The reader will bear in mind that the General, like St.\r\nPeter, was himself also a married man.\r\n\r\n  \"DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n  \"The letter you favoured me with gives me, at last, an opportunity\r\n  of congratulating you upon your marriage. I am very sensible it is a\r\n  state which must be attended by extraordinary expenses, and wish it\r\n  was in my power to enable you, with perfect ease, to defray them. I\r\n  would even adopt the mode you propose, of appointing you\r\n  Quartermaster, if I thought the good of the service required; but as\r\n  it does not appear to me necessary for every detached company to\r\n  have a staff annexed to it, I am sure you will have the goodness to\r\n  excuse my incurring any extraordinary charges upon Government which\r\n  I could not properly justify.\r\n\r\n                                         \"I am, with regard, &c., &c.\"\r\n\r\nAnother letter which the General had written was to a friend at\r\nWoolwich, who superintended the recruiting for the Battalion, which was\r\nthen much below its establishment. In answer to repeated remonstrances,\r\na few handfuls of men from the other Battalions were sent,—not the best,\r\nit is to be feared, if human nature then were like human nature now;\r\nand, at last, recruits being no longer obtainable in England, the\r\nexperiment was tried of recruiting in Ireland, and the first draft was\r\nsent to the 4th Battalion. At this time the Irish Artillery, afterwards\r\nthe 7th Battalion of the Royal Artillery, enjoyed a separate existence,\r\nand secured the best recruits in Ireland. The refuse only remained for\r\nthe Royal Artillery, and the following is the graphic language used by\r\nthe gallant General in describing the new levies as they landed in New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\n\"The drafts have arrived, four having deserted, and one died upon the\r\npassage. I should not have been very much afflicted if many of those who\r\nlanded here had saved me, either by death or desertion, the pain of\r\nlooking at them, for such warriors of 5 feet 5½ inches I never saw\r\nraised before for the service of Artillery.... I presume the reason why\r\nso few stand of arms accompanied them was the consideration of these\r\nwhippers-in and postilions of fellows being unable to bear them: but I\r\nmust try how far the strength of these diminutive warriors is equal to\r\ncarry _muskets cut down_, for they shall never appear, while I command\r\nthem, otherwise than as soldiers.... Hard times, indeed, and great must\r\nbe the scarcity of men, when the Royal Artillery is obliged to take such\r\nreptiles. I would they were back in the bogs from which they sprang.\"\r\n\r\nIn less than a hundred years, had the General lived, he would have seen\r\nmany of even a worse stamp landing here, to swell the army of New York\r\nRowdies,—men who poison the blood of the American commonwealth, making\r\nthe great Republic break out into hideous and pestilent sores, which in\r\nthe eyes of the world deface and hide the beauties it so undoubtedly\r\npossesses.\r\n\r\nThe third and last letter to be quoted is a more serious one; and is\r\naddressed to the Right Honourable the Board of Ordnance, at this time\r\nvery wooden-headed, very obstinate, very devoted to every form of\r\ncircumlocution. Their officials loved then to snub, and carp, and\r\ndisallow; to thrust on the festive board at any joyous time some hideous\r\nskull of pigheaded queries; and to look with suspicion on any one who\r\ndared to think for himself. The officials of the Ordnance have passed\r\naway; but who shall say that the type is extinct?\r\n\r\nAh! this gunner who governed New York! He had his rough hours with the\r\nrebels, and with the citizens, and with his motley army, but the\r\nroughest were when the convoys coming in brought the usual budget of\r\nstupendous idiocy, written by clerks who knew not, probably, whether\r\nAmerica lay to the east or the west of the Tower, but who felt that\r\ntheir duty was to be to the conscientious officer an eternal nightmare.\r\n\r\nThe good General, who thought of England's interests before anything\r\nelse, had recently given permission for the pay of the men to be drawn\r\nby bills on Messrs. Cox and Mair, the rate of exchange at the time being\r\nsuch as to leave a handsome surplus to the Government on the sale of the\r\nbills. But no sooner did the members of the worshipful Board hear of\r\nthis, than each particular hair stood on end on each individual head,\r\nand a letter was despatched to the General reprimanding him for daring\r\nto think of himself. Fortunately Messrs. Cox and Mair protected the\r\nbills: but no more were drawn, and the General's scheme for saving his\r\ncountry's money was ruthlessly butchered. As luck would have it, the\r\nsame mail brought to the General letters of commendation from the King\r\nand all in authority; and the confirmation of the rank of Major-General,\r\nbestowed on him by Sir Henry Clinton for service in the field. This\r\nenabled him to quote the satisfaction expressed by others with his\r\nconduct, in the commencement of his letter to the Board, thus giving a\r\npoint to his next dignified sentences, acknowledging their rebuke.\r\n\"These marks, my Lord and gentlemen, of your displeasure, and the never\r\nhaving received the honour (notwithstanding my unwearied endeavours to\r\ndeserve it,) of _your_ declared approbation in any instance since I have\r\nbeen entrusted with the direction of your affairs in this service,\r\ncannot fail to give me the most sensible mortification. The extensive\r\nand complicated command I have is sufficiently onerous of itself, but\r\nunder the present circumstances the weight becomes less supportable. I\r\nshould, therefore, be exceedingly glad if I might be permitted to\r\ntransfer it over to abler hands, who might probably be more fortunate in\r\ngiving fuller satisfaction.\"\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to say that the brainless scribes in the Tower were a\r\nlittle quieter after this, and more sparing of their senseless\r\ncriticism.\r\n\r\nBefore doing anything else, the General's custom during his morning's\r\nride was to look at the batteries near his house, known then as Fort\r\nGeorge and Grand Battery. The former was a regular fortification, and\r\nthe latter mounted 94 guns. They were situated where the Castle Garden—\r\nfor the reception of emigrants—and the South Ferry House now stand. They\r\ncommanded the river between New York and Brooklyn heights, and New York\r\nand Staten Island. The fortifications on Brooklyn heights, especially\r\nFort Stirling, had been immensely strengthened by General Pattison, and\r\nnot a point on New York Island was left unarmed by him. He availed\r\nhimself of many breast-works and trenches, and of large works like Fort\r\nIndependence, which the Americans had built when they contemplated the\r\ndefence, instead of the evacuation of New York: and he strengthened them\r\nin the most laborious and efficient manner. To his efforts more than any\r\nother's, was the fact due that the City remained unmolested during the\r\nwhole war. His labours and duties were enormous. His command being co-\r\nextensive with the North American continent, he would one day receive\r\ndemands for powder and guns from Halifax, Nova Scotia, and the next day\r\nfrom Florida, or from Captain Traille in Virginia. Captain Traille was\r\none of those men to be met with even now in the Artillery, a man with a\r\ngrievance. He had been made _local_ Major, and had applied without\r\nsuccess to have the rank made substantive. He took his revenge out of\r\nthe Government by demanding stores in the wildest manner. The first\r\nthing he always did on arriving at a new station was to send in\r\nrequisitions, as if he were going to fortify Gibraltar.\r\n\r\nThe soreness on Captain Traille's part appears in other ways in the\r\nrecords of the time. A young gentleman, named Black, who, according to\r\nthe custom in those days, had carried arms in his company with great\r\ndistinction, refused a commission in the Artillery offered him by the\r\nMaster-General, and accepted one instead in Lord Rawdon's New York\r\nVolunteers. It is easy to imagine the lad going to his Captain for\r\nadvice, and finding him brooding over the unfortunate Majority, or\r\ncalculating how next to worry the authorities with store-demands. And\r\nhaving imagined this, it is not difficult to imagine what the Captain's\r\nadvice would be.\r\n\r\nWhile talking of stores, it is worthy of mention that at one time so\r\nheavy had been the demands on the General from out-stations,\r\nparticularly from Halifax, which was reduced to barely seven rounds a\r\ngun, that there were only 476 barrels of powder left in the whole city\r\nand district of New York, under British rule. There was, as is apparent\r\nfrom contemporary correspondence, not a little anxiety on the subject in\r\nthe Commandant's office.\r\n\r\nAlthough General Pattison was saved much laborious and unpleasant\r\ncorrespondence by having a very competent staff, he occasionally took\r\nthe pen himself in official differences, even with his regimental\r\nsubordinates. One, Captain William Johnstone, had entered a remonstrance\r\nshowing that two of the officers posted to his company were prisoners in\r\nthe hands of the rebels, and the other two were in England. Had he\r\nremained content with a bare statement of facts, he would have done\r\nwell, but he went on to make insinuations; and after also disparaging\r\nthe men who had been sent to his Company with the last draft, he\r\nconcluded by hinting that the climate of Pensacola, where he was\r\nstationed, disagreed with him. To whom the General: \"As to the idea\r\nwhich you think proper to throw out, and which I cannot but think an\r\nextraordinary one, of officers endeavouring to get out of their\r\ncommands, no such applications have ever been made to me; consequently,\r\nI cannot have granted the improper indulgences you allude to; but with\r\nrespect to indulgences to officers under my command, I must desire to be\r\nconsidered the best judge how far they may be bestowed, consistent with\r\nthe good of the service.... The men whom you think so bad were not\r\npicked out, but impartially drafted; and if any of them carry the marks\r\nof bad behaviour on their backs, I hope the end will be answered by\r\ntheir correcting it for the future, and that their good conduct under\r\nyou will be the means of soon wearing them out.... I am very sorry that\r\nthe climate of Pensacola disagrees with you so much, but hope that you\r\nwill soon recover your health.\"\r\n\r\nThe reader will now be good enough to accompany the General up Broadway,\r\ntowards Hester Street, in the Bowery, then one of the extreme streets\r\nyet built in New York, and near the spot where the British landed on\r\n16th September, 1776, to occupy the city. It was close to the place\r\nwhere St. Mark's Church now stands; and at that date was marked by the\r\nexistence of the house of the last Dutch Governor of New York, built of\r\nyellow brick, imported from Holland, now unfortunately destroyed. In\r\nHester Street lived Mrs. Douglas, the young wife of as brave a subaltern\r\nof Artillery as ever stepped. The General had just received a despatch\r\nfrom Sir Henry Clinton, then engaged in operations up the Hudson, in\r\nwhich young Douglas's bravery, coolness, and skill had been mentioned in\r\nthe highest terms. Before writing to his subaltern to express the\r\nsatisfaction he derived from such a report, the General hastened to tell\r\nthe good news to Mrs. Douglas; thus killing two birds with one stone,\r\nfor it enabled him to add to his letter a postscript which he knew young\r\nDouglas would value, giving all the latest news from his home. It was\r\nthis thoughtfulness which endeared him to his officers; it is from such\r\nlittle data as this that the student learns how loveable as well as able\r\nthis gallant officer was. The day shall come—and not so far distant—when\r\nthe General shall stop in the same street at a door not much farther on,\r\nbut his face shall be sad, and his step slow, as he mounts the staircase\r\nto tell of a young husband lying under the turf near Charlestown,\r\nwounded to death in the battle, and dying with his wife's name on his\r\nlips, and love for her in his glazing eye. As he enters the room, there\r\nshall be that in his face which a woman's wit shall too quickly read,\r\nand the cry of a broken heart shall echo on the old man's ears for years\r\nto come!\r\n\r\nLeaving Hester Street the General rode towards Ranelagh House, then a\r\nspecies of Tea Gardens, out of the city, but only a little east of the\r\npresent intersection of Anthony Street and West Broadway. About twenty-\r\nfive years before the British occupation of New York, to which this\r\nchapter refers, this house was the residence of Major James, of the\r\nRoyal Artillery, a man of great taste and considerable private means. He\r\nwent on one occasion on leave to England; and, during his absence, the\r\ncelebrated Riot on the arrival of the Stamps took place. A mob, which\r\ntook the name of the \"Sons of Liberty,\" having first burnt the\r\nLieutenant-Governor in effigy, and broken his Coach of State to pieces,\r\nwent off playfully to Major James's unprotected house, burned his\r\nvaluable library and large collection of works of art, and ruined his\r\nbeautiful garden. A few months later, it became a public-house, kept by\r\none John Jones, who sent fireworks off in the evening, and by day and\r\nnight gratified the thirst of the Sons of Liberty. It was a curious\r\nheaping of coals of fire, that a few years later it should fall to this\r\nvery Major James—after a six weeks' passage from Plymouth, to bring the\r\njoyful news of the repeal of the Stamp Act. Ranelagh House had become\r\nduring the War a great place for recruiting for the various Regiments\r\nraised for the King's service in New York. During General Pattison's\r\ncommand, no less than 4000 Loyalist Volunteers were doing duty in the\r\ncity, and 3000 more were away on duty in the South. Some statistics\r\nregarding these volunteer corps may be interesting. The New Jersey\r\nGentlemen Volunteers, embodied—as the recruiting notices said—\"during\r\nthis wanton rebellion,\" received each 20 dollars bounty, and \"everything\r\nnecessary to complete a gentleman soldier;\" Lord Rawdon's Ireland\r\nVolunteers received each 30_s._ bounty; and men were tempted to enlist\r\ninto Colonel Simcoe's Queen's Ranger Hussars by the promise of \"an\r\nelegant horse, cloathing &c., to the amount of 40 guineas: the bringer\r\nto get 2_l._ 2_s._\" Men enlisting into the regular army got one guinea\r\nbounty; and on one occasion when men were wanted for regiments in the\r\nWest Indies, the married men of New York were tempted by the offer of\r\n5_s._ a week for the husband, 3_s._ 9_d._ a week for his wife, and 2_s._\r\n6_d._ a week for each child, over and above prize-money.\r\n\r\nSide by side with these various notices, as well as on every public\r\nplace and in every newspaper, an intimation was to be found,\r\ncharacteristic of the General's method and accuracy, calling upon any\r\none who had any claim against the Royal Artillery, or the Ordnance, to\r\nsubmit it without delay. This same method is visible in all his internal\r\ncivil arrangements, showing that he possessed admirable qualifications\r\nfor the post of Home Secretary as well as General. He ordered every\r\nstranger on arrival in the city to report himself on pain of suspicion;\r\nthe citizens had to form a nightly watch in their respective wards,\r\nsubject to 24 hours' imprisonment, or 1 dollar fine, if absent, in\r\naddition to making up the duty; each chimney had to be swept once a\r\nmonth under penalty of a 5_l._ fine; a certain number, only, of public-\r\nhouses was licensed, on the recommendation of the principal officers of\r\nthe Army and Navy, or of respectable inhabitants; and any one selling\r\nliquor without a licence was fined 5_l._ and the money given to the\r\npoor. All carmen were obliged to have licences; and if any one\r\novercharged his fare, he was fined 40_s._, one half going to the poor,\r\nand the other half to the informer.\r\n\r\nA favourite punishment for misdemeanours and theft was banishment beyond\r\nthe lines, accompanied by further severe punishment if the offender\r\nshould return. The inhabitants were liable to confinement in the main-\r\nguard, but their cases had to be inquired into by the civil magistrates\r\nbefore 11 A.M. on the following day. Negro slaves and others deemed\r\nworthy of corporal punishment were sent to a court-martial; and able-\r\nbodied offenders were not unfrequently sent on board the Admiral's\r\nFleet.\r\n\r\nThe General's arrangements for the various ferries were excellent, and\r\nall the profits went to the poor. Boatmen had to take out licences, and\r\nin event of overcharge they were punished in the same way as the carmen.\r\nAuctioneers had not merely to provide themselves with licences, but also\r\nto find sureties to the amount of 5000_l._ New York currency. And at any\r\nmeeting of the vestry which concerned the disbursement of public money,\r\nthe Mayor was compelled to be present, and make a report to the\r\nCommandant, as well as to see that his wishes were complied with.\r\n\r\nA good deal of trouble arose from what was called the Neutral Ground,\r\nextending some 30 miles above the Island of New York, and not included\r\nin the lines of either army. It was a fertile and populous country, but\r\nmuch infested by bands of plunderers, called cow-boys and skinners. The\r\ncow-boys lived within the British lines, and bought, or stole, cattle\r\nfor the use of the troops. The rendezvous of the skinners was within the\r\nAmerican lines. They professed to be great patriots, making it their\r\nostensible business to plunder those who refused to take the oath of\r\nallegiance to the State of New York. But they were ready in fact to\r\nplunder any one, and the cattle they thus obtained were often sold to\r\nthe cow-boys in exchange for dry goods from New York. It was when\r\ntraversing this neutral ground, that the unfortunate Major André was\r\ncaptured. By the way, the General in his morning's ride passed the house\r\nwhere André was to dine the evening before he should start on his ill-\r\nfated journey. It was an old Dutch house which remained standing until\r\n1850, near the present intersection of 2nd Avenue and 34th Street; and\r\nwas occupied during the British occupation, as an officer's quarter, by\r\nColonel Williams of the 80th Regiment.\r\n\r\nIn continuing his ride, the General went to Greenwich, a village\r\nsituated at that time a mile and a half out of the city, but now in the\r\nvery heart of it, where the German troops in English pay were stationed.\r\nOf all the mistakes made by England in that war—and they were many—the\r\nhiring of mercenaries to fight the Americans was perhaps the greatest.\r\nIt irritated many loyal men into rebellion, and gave a union and\r\ncohesion to the disloyal, such as they never otherwise would have\r\ngained. Nor were the mercenaries very valuable as soldiers; they were\r\ndiscontented and quarrelsome; and to their want of vigilance was the\r\nirreparable disaster of Trenton wholly due. Even to this day, the\r\nAmericans talk most bitterly of their being hired by the English to\r\nshoot down their own flesh and blood; and there can be no doubt that\r\nmore soreness was due to this circumstance, than to any other connected\r\nwith the war. Apart, however, from the general question, there was no\r\nCommanding officer whose management of the foreign troops displayed so\r\nmuch tact, as General Pattison. Whether it were on duty, or on such\r\noccasions as the celebrated ball given by him on the King's Birthday in\r\n1780, which he opened with the wife of the German Baron who commanded at\r\nGreenwich, his courtesy and tact were always exerted to cement\r\ndifferences, or allay grievances.\r\n\r\nReturning homewards from Greenwich, the General rode through a great\r\nmany burnt streets, burnt by incendiaries the night after the English\r\noccupied New York, and at a fire which took place later;—past not a few\r\nchurches which had been converted into prisons, riding-schools, and\r\nhospitals, for at times the sickness in the city was very great;—past\r\nVauxhall, where Sir Peter Warren lived; past the house in Hanover Square\r\nwhere Prince William stayed, when sent out by the King in compliment to\r\nhis American subjects; and past the dwelling of that most princely of\r\ndinner-givers, honest Admiral Walton. As he rode along, he passed\r\nprinted anathemas on the walls against privateering, and notices of 20\r\nguineas reward from the Government, and 10 guineas additional from the\r\ninsurance offices, for the discovery of any man who should have seduced\r\na soldier on board a privateer. There were no less than 5000 New Yorkers\r\nengaged during the war in this lawless occupation. It was certainly\r\nadding insult to injury, after the sleepless nights they sometimes\r\ncaused to the General, but the owners of a very fast privateer had\r\nactually the impertinence to name their ship after him.\r\n\r\nOn his way home he rode into the Ordnance Yard, where a few words of\r\ncomfort had to be spoken to the men whose wages were so disproportionate\r\nto those of ordinary civil labourers, that not merely were they\r\ndiscontented, but they could hardly live at all. Ordinary labourers in\r\nthe city got 5_s._ a day, and skilled artisans could earn as much as\r\n12_s._ and 15_s._; but in the Ordnance Yard the average wage was only\r\n3_s._ a day and a ration, and in vain had the General urged on the Board\r\nof Ordnance to sanction some approximation to the wages of the other\r\nlabourers in New York. While men could be got with ease near the Tower\r\nof London for 3_s._ a day, the Board of Ordnance might as well have been\r\nexpected to pay more in America, as their clerks to learn geography.\r\n\r\nThe General having now returned to Broadway, let two or three instances\r\nbe mentioned, in which he prominently figured during his command at New\r\nYork, before closing this chapter.\r\n\r\nThe first shall be the only instance in which the General ever showed\r\nany symptom of insubordination. He forgot the soldier in the gunner. On\r\nthe last day of May, 1779, he accompanied Sir Henry Clinton, the\r\nCommander-in-Chief, to within 3 miles of Stony Point on the Hudson; and\r\nas Artillery became necessary in carrying out the proposed attack,\r\nGeneral Pattison was ordered to take command of the troops. During the\r\nnight—a dark, moonless night—the Artillery for the service was got up,\r\nand the batteries completed by five o'clock in the morning,\r\nnotwithstanding great difficulties, arising from a bad landing-place and\r\na very steep precipice. Orders were then given to commence firing on the\r\nenemy's works, and, notwithstanding the great distance, the fire was\r\nsoon seen to have been effectual. Sir Henry Clinton therefore sent\r\ninstructions to the General to cease firing, but the General's blood was\r\nup. The range had been got to an inch and he hungered to go on; so\r\ninstead of ceasing fire, he sent back an earnest request to be allowed a\r\nfew more rounds. Very soon, however, a white flag was seen; and in a few\r\nminutes it was known that the whole rebel force had surrendered.\r\n\r\nThe next sketch may be said to show the culminating point of the\r\nGeneral's career as Commandant of New York. The winter of 1779 was the\r\nhardest, it is believed, ever recorded in that city. The water was\r\nfrozen between New York and Staten Island, and guns were carried over on\r\nsleighs. It was an anxious time. The insular advantages of New York\r\ndisappeared before this unexpected high-road of ice; the Jerseys were\r\nswarming with Washington's troops; and as nearly the whole of the\r\nregular forces had gone from New York to Charlestown on special service,\r\nthe General dreaded an attack which he might be unable to resist.\r\nNotwithstanding the croaking of many advisers, he called out, and\r\nresolved to arm, the inhabitants, to test the sincerity of their\r\nprofessions of loyalty, and to ascertain whether his rule in the city\r\nhad been a successful one. To those who assured him that it was a rash\r\nmeasure, he answered that he felt confident that the number of doubtful\r\ncharacters was but trifling, and as those few would be blended in the\r\nranks with the many who could be relied on, they would be less capable\r\nof doing mischief under arms, than if \"left to lurk in their dwellings.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the event proved that he was right. In a few hours he had 4300 loyal\r\nvolunteers between 17 and 60 years of age, armed at their own expense,\r\nuntil arms could no longer be bought, when they received them from the\r\nKing's stores; he had merchants of the city standing sentry on his own\r\nhouse; and so fired were the naval officers by his energy, that they\r\nlanded all the sailors they could spare, and put them under his orders.\r\nIn return, the General courteously named a new battery which he was\r\nbuilding, the Royal Naval Battery, and gave it to the sailors to man.\r\nAnd the result was that the city remained unmolested.\r\n\r\nThe anxiety the General suffered during the winter of 1779 aggravated a\r\ncomplaint from which he had been suffering for some time, which he\r\ndescribes in his diary as \"a stubborn disease which no medicine can\r\nallay,\" and he began to feel that rest and change were necessary. So he\r\napplied for, and obtained, leave of absence to go home for the benefit\r\nof the Bath waters; but so reluctant was he to leave his post that it\r\nwas late in the autumn of 1780, before he actually sailed. During the\r\nfew months immediately preceding his departure his correspondence is a\r\nmixture of explanations to the authorities at home of the reasons for\r\nhis return, and entreaties to his officers to write to him at Bath, and\r\nkeep him posted in all the news of the war. During the three years of\r\nhis command he had got everything into such admirable order, that its\r\ntransfer to his successor was simpler than could have been expected from\r\nits complicated and extensive nature. He received a perfect ovation on\r\nhis departure, both from the civil and military part of the population;\r\nand the dear old man had hardly sat down in Bath, before he wrote off to\r\nall his old friends of the 4th Battalion.\r\n\r\nIn all that General Pattison did—whether on duty or not—he was\r\nessentially conscientious and hard-working. And these are the two\r\nqualities which rule the world. George Macdonald—in his lecture on\r\nMilton—said that on rising from a study of the poet's works, he felt\r\nthat he had been gazing on one who was, in every noble sense of the\r\nword, _a man_. And the student of General Pattison's letters and orders\r\nfeels also, in quitting the dusty tomes and faded letters, that he has\r\nbeen conversing with a true, a noble man.\r\n\r\nA brief notice of his death will suitably close this chapter. He lived\r\nto be a very old man. Twice he was appointed Commandant of Woolwich, a\r\ncommand less onerous than that which he held in America, but still a\r\nprize to which every Artillery officer looks forward. At last on a March\r\nmorning in the year 1805, that stubborn disease which indeed no medicine\r\ncan allay, that old, old disease, death, stole into Hill Street,\r\nBerkeley Square, and touched on the shoulder, in his 82nd year, the\r\ngallant old soldier, a chapter in whose life has just been alluded to.\r\n\r\nIt was a year of note for England. War was going on in the East and in\r\nthe West, and success had attended the English arms in both. Europe was\r\nbristling with armed men, whom the genius and the dread of Napoleon had\r\nproduced; and in England alone, besides a gigantic regular army, 325,000\r\nvolunteers had rallied to protect the soil against a not improbable\r\ninvasion. The cost of the army that year was over fourteen millions, in\r\naddition to which over four millions were voted for the Ordnance; and no\r\nless than four and a half millions more for the support of the militia\r\nand volunteers fell upon the groaning taxpayers. Nearly everything in\r\nEngland was taxed, and this year saw the taxes increased. A man's\r\npension, office, personal estate, and everything that could be called a\r\nluxury was heavily mulct; if a legacy were left him, it shrank wofully\r\nin the process of reaching him; his profession or trade was made but\r\nanother excuse for picking his pocket; if he smoked, the tax-gatherer\r\nwaited round the corner; if he took snuff, the same relentless visitor\r\ncalled upon him; and yet, after all, the revenue of the country fell far\r\nshort of its expenditure. The horrified fund-holder saw Consols quoted\r\nat 58, and yet Parliament borrowing right and left to make the two ends\r\nmeet. Twenty-four millions were borrowed by annuities, and twelve\r\nmillions by Exchequer bills; and driven to his wits' end by want of\r\nfunds, the Chancellor of the Exchequer started lotteries to raise the\r\nwind.\r\n\r\nA year of note in England. It was the year when Trafalgar was fought,\r\nand a country wept in the hour of victory for a life that could not be\r\nspared. A year when men were Titans; a fit year for a soldier to live;\r\nno unfit one in which he could die who had done to the very last his\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1805, the old General passed to his rest. Perhaps, as he lay\r\ndying, his mind wandered to the Far West, where so important a part of\r\nhis career had been passed; to the Hudson, bound then in the grip of\r\nwinter; to the trees at West Point waving their naked arms in the wind,\r\nas if praying for summer; to New York spreading in peace as it never\r\ncould have spread in war; to that great country, destined to be greater\r\nyet, but ah! never to be so pure as in those days of its infancy as a\r\nRepublic, whose people were listening—even as he died—to the words\r\naddressed to them by their new President, words of soberness and peace,\r\nsuch as Washington himself would have loved.\r\n\r\nAnd so the old man went to sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIX.\r\n                         CONCLUSION OF THE WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEFORE summing up the Artillery share in the American War of\r\nIndependence, a glance may be taken at the domestic life of the Regiment\r\nat this time. From the date when the Regimental feeling first developed\r\nitself, there has always been a body of officers whom taste,\r\nopportunity, or ability has singled out to express the hopes, schemes,\r\nor resolutions, which may have existed among the officers at large for\r\nthe welfare of the Corps. The centre of the Regimental life which has\r\nfound its expression in such men has always been Woolwich. In the\r\nearlier days of the Regiment this was natural, as its head-quarters and\r\nits commanding officer were at that station: in later times, when the\r\nRegiment became too large for the supervision of one man, the head-\r\nquarters of the Battalions were concentrated there; and after the\r\nappointment of a Deputy-Adjutant-General of the Royal Artillery, his\r\noffice remained at Woolwich for many years, the centre of administration\r\nof the whole corps. The large force of Artillery always at Woolwich, the\r\nmanufacturing departments, and the numerous Regimental establishments,\r\nsuch, for example, as the Royal Artillery Institution, and the\r\nDepartment of Artillery studies, conspire at the present day to render\r\nWoolwich more than ever the centre of the Regiment's intellectual and\r\ndomestic life.\r\n\r\nIn the correspondence between officers at out-stations and at head-\r\nquarters, at various times in the Regiment's history, may be read much\r\nthat is interesting of Regimental schemes and wishes. The great domestic\r\nevent during the American war was undoubtedly the formation of the\r\nInvalid Battalion, thus ridding the four service Battalions of their\r\ninvalid companies, and giving them effective men instead. The promotion\r\ngiven by the augmentation gave also great satisfaction to the officers,\r\nand in no place was it hailed with more delight than in America.\r\nAlthough the Invalid Battalion was not formed until 1779, its formation\r\nhad been part of a scheme which had entered into the consideration of\r\nthe thoughtful officers of the Regiment for some years. In a letter from\r\nGeneral Pattison, at New York, to Captain Blomefield, at Woolwich, the\r\nscheme is thus alluded to. \"I have just time, and that is all, to\r\nacknowledge and thank you for your obliging communication of the new\r\narrangement for the Corps of Artillery. I began to despair of that plan,\r\nafter lying dormant so long, ever taking place. You will, I am sure, do\r\nme the justice to believe that its being brought to light again, and\r\ncarried into execution, affords me the truest satisfaction, and I very\r\nsincerely congratulate you upon the event. I hope, too, it is a prelude\r\nto something still better, _and that the next step will be to form the\r\nfour Battalions into as many Regiments, to consist of two Battalions\r\neach_; and then I think the young officers need not be very solicitous\r\nto get into the Line.\" This is a very interesting quotation; and shows\r\nthat the idea which has frequently been entertained, although happily\r\nnever carried out, of dividing the Regiment into small Regiments with\r\nindependent promotion, is at least a century old. Division of a\r\ndifferent description may soon be necessary; a more thorough separation\r\nof the Garrison Artillery from the Horse and Field Artillery; but a\r\ndivision into several Regiments would have few good results, and many\r\nevil. That the division, which it is said above may become necessary,\r\nhas never been effected, is demonstrative of the strength of the\r\nRegimental feeling, which could tolerate so many anomalies, rather than\r\nadmit the small end of the wedge of separation. As science progresses,\r\nSiege and Garrison Artillery wander farther away every day from the\r\nField branch of the Arm; and the difficulty of ensuring the necessary\r\nproficiency in officers who are changed repeatedly from one service to\r\nanother wholly distinct, as well as the natural tendencies of young\r\nofficers towards the mounted branches, may some day compel the issue of\r\nthe long deferred edict of divorce. That such divorce is practicable\r\nwithout infringing on the Regimental system is as firmly believed by\r\nthose who have given the subject their consideration, as that the duties\r\nof the various branches would be better performed, were the officers to\r\nrealize that they would be retained in their performance during the\r\nwhole of their professional lives. Embarrassing details, and individual\r\nhardships, might terrify a military reformer from undertaking the task;\r\nbut such hardships are inevitable in every reform, and it is the duty of\r\na conscientious and statesmanlike reformer to master details, instead of\r\nbeing mastered by them.\r\n\r\nA century ago, the anxiety for a division of the Regiment which animated\r\nnot a few thoughtful officers was inspired by the longing to create a\r\npromotion in the junior ranks, which would stimulate zeal, and remove\r\nthe despair which was creeping over them. Not a few subalterns during\r\nthe American War, who distinguished themselves, asked and obtained as\r\ntheir reward commissions in the Line. The elder officers might well\r\nbecome anxious, and look hungrily for any scheme which would deter their\r\nyounger comrades from abandoning a service to which they did honour. And\r\nin this anxiety we may read an explanation of the almost undue delight\r\nwhich the creation of the Invalid Battalion, and eight additional\r\nservice companies, with the consequent promotion, produced.\r\n\r\nNot that in the Fourth Battalion there was not another minor reason for\r\nrejoicing. Its head-quarter staff had accompanied the Battalion almost\r\nfrom the commencement of the War; and there was no one at home to give\r\nthe same attention to the recruiting, as would have been paid by the\r\nBattalion's own staff. The creation of two new service companies, to\r\nremain at Woolwich as a Depôt for the companies abroad, would, it was\r\nhoped, ensure more care in recruiting, and, as General Pattison wrote\r\nironically, \"my friends will not be put to the trouble of sending me any\r\nmore drafts of _picked_ men.\" The recruiting accounts for the various\r\ncompanies would also be expedited, for under the existing arrangement it\r\ntoo often happened, as the General wrote, that \"the Agents have been\r\nprevented by more important affairs from bringing to any settlement the\r\nconcerns of those, who are at 3000 miles' distance.\"\r\n\r\nBut there were more pleasing subjects of correspondence between Woolwich\r\nand the out-stations than recruiting or promotion. There was a genuine\r\ndesire springing up in the hearts of the more thoughtful officers for a\r\nmore scientific training, a desire which was daily acquiring strength,\r\nand whose mere existence ensured success; for those who sought it for\r\nothers, endeavoured by their own exertions to secure it for themselves.\r\nAt this time in the Regiment's history the feeling attained strength and\r\ncertainty that to be a scientific corps was as high an aim as to win\r\nbattles. Armed science was felt to be the aim of study. Something higher\r\nthan mere gallantry, something more durable than brilliancy or _dash_,\r\nwas felt to be necessary in officers of Artillery. Inventive genius was\r\nencouraged in the professional field; individual talent was coaxed and\r\nrewarded; and to the ordinary Regimental _esprit_, without which a\r\nmilitary life would be a mere Valley of Dry Bones, was added scientific\r\nenthusiasm. There was, doubtless, much haziness as to ways and means;\r\nmuch uncertainty as to the details of the closer alliance which it was\r\nfelt should exist between the corps and the scientific world; but there\r\nwas enthusiasm, and a readiness to employ any aids already existing,\r\nwhich would certainly ensure success. The foundation of the Royal\r\nMilitary Repository; the establishment of such Government works as those\r\nat Waltham Abbey; the closer connection between the Royal Laboratory and\r\nthe Regiment by the appointment of Captain Congreve as the Controller of\r\nthe former,—all combined to give increased life and strength to the\r\nscientific tendencies which might otherwise have languished. The feeling\r\nwhich was to find strong and eloquent expression from distinguished,\r\nalthough unprofessional lips, nearly a century later, in the same\r\nWoolwich where it had been born, was certainly, albeit dimly, in\r\nexistence then. With what a ring did the words now to be quoted echo in\r\nthe old birthplace of the Regiment! How grandly did they give shape and\r\nconsistency to the dreams which for a hundred years had been haunting\r\nthose to whom their profession was dear!\r\n\r\n\"The two classes,\" said the eloquent speaker,[38] \"which will have an\r\nincreasing—it may be a preponderating—influence on the fate of the human\r\nrace for some time, will be the pupils of Aristotle and those of\r\nAlexander,—the men of science and the soldiers. In spite of all\r\nappearances and all declamations to the contrary, that is my firm\r\nconviction. They, and they alone, will be left to rule, because they\r\nalone—each in his own sphere—have learnt to obey. It is, therefore, most\r\nneedful for the welfare of society that they should pull with, and not\r\nagainst, each other,—that they should understand each other, respect\r\neach other, take counsel with each other, supplement each other's\r\ndefects, bring out each other's higher tendencies, counteract each\r\nother's lower ones. The scientific man has something to learn of you,\r\nwhich I doubt not that he will learn in good time. You, again, have\r\nsomething to learn of him, which you, I doubt not, will learn in good\r\ntime likewise. Repeat—each of you according to his powers—the old\r\nfriendship between Aristotle and Alexander; and so, from the sympathy\r\nand co-operation of you two, a class of thinkers and actors may yet\r\narise, which can save this nation, and the other civilized nations of\r\nthe world, from that of which I had rather not speak, and wish that I\r\ndid not think, too often and too earnestly.\r\n\r\n\"I may be a dreamer; and I may consider, in my turn, as wilder dreamers\r\nthan myself, certain persons who fancy that their only business in life\r\nis to make money;—the scientific man's only business to show them how to\r\nmake money;—and the soldier's only business to guard their money for\r\nthem. Be that as it may, the finest type of civilized man which we are\r\nlikely to see for some generations to come will be produced by a\r\ncombination of the truly military with the truly scientific man. I say,\r\nI may be a dreamer; but you at least, as well as my scientific friends,\r\nwill bear with me, for my dream is to your honour.\"\r\n\r\nBut to return to the operations of the Army in America. In the last\r\nchapter allusion was made to the successful attack made on Stony Point,\r\non the Hudson, by the British troops from New York, in which General\r\nPattison took a prominent part. Very shortly afterwards a dashing\r\nattempt was made by the Americans to retake it. The post was considered\r\nto be safe against any sudden surprise; but at midnight, on the 15th\r\nJuly, 1779, a bold and daring attempt was made to retake it, and it was\r\ncarried by storm in less than twenty minutes. The number of the\r\nassailants was stated by themselves not to exceed six hundred, under\r\nBrigadier Wayne. The garrison was nearly equal in strength, and\r\ncommanded by Colonel Johnson, of the 17th Regiment, an officer of\r\nconsiderable experience and reputation; yet the enemy, advancing in two\r\nor three columns from different points, was in a few minutes master of\r\nthe place. The Commandant of New York, in his report of the occurrence\r\nto Lord Townshend, said: \"It must, in justice, be allowed to General\r\nWayne's credit, as well as to all acting under his orders, that no\r\ninstance of inhumanity was shown to any of the unhappy captives. No one\r\nwas unnecessarily put to the sword or wantonly wounded. Our loss in\r\nkilled is not yet ascertained, but it is thought to be trifling, and the\r\nnumber of wounded amounts only to one Captain, four subalterns, and\r\nabout eight-and-thirty men, of whom is one corporal of the Artillery.\r\nThe rebels assert that they had only four men killed. Our loss in\r\nprisoners is a very serious one—almost the whole of the 17th Regiment,\r\ntwo companies of the 71st (Grenadiers), about sixty of the Loyal\r\nAmerican Corps, and, I am particularly grieved to say, one Captain, one\r\nsubaltern, four non-commissioned officers, thirty-nine privates, and one\r\ndrummer of the Artillery. One subaltern (Lieutenant Roberts) made his\r\nescape by getting to the shore, and swimming near a mile to the\r\n'Vulture' Sloop of War.\"[39]\r\n\r\nAs soon as they obtained possession of the work, the Americans turned\r\nthe guns of the fort against the opposite post of Verplank's Point,\r\noccupied by the 33rd Regiment, Ferguson's Corps, and part of the Loyal\r\nAmerican Battalion. Part of the rebel force, under General Macdougal,\r\nthreatened an attack upon the east side, and repeatedly attempted to\r\nforce the piquets, but without success, for Colonel Webster and the\r\ntroops under his command behaved with great spirit. Reinforcements from\r\nthe camp and from Philipsburg soon arrived; and the enemy, somewhat\r\nhastily, evacuated Stony Point, demolishing the works as much as\r\npossible, and carrying off all the brass guns and stores in a large\r\narmed galley, mounting one 32-pounder and eight 4-pounders, which they\r\nsent down the river for the purpose. Fortunately, the wind was against\r\nthe vessel on her return; and Lieutenant Douglas, of the Artillery, who\r\nwas in command of a detachment at Verplank's Point, opened fire on her\r\nwith such success from an 18-pounder gun, that, after being hulled\r\nseveral times, she was run on shore to prevent her sinking, and then set\r\non fire. Lieutenant Douglas, as was mentioned in the last chapter, and\r\nhis detachment, were honoured by the thanks of the Commander-in-Chief\r\nfor their good behaviour. \"Endeavours were afterwards used to recover\r\nthe cannon, but as they did not succeed it was presumed that the rebels\r\nwith their usual industry found some means, under favour of the night,\r\nto convey them up the river. Upon the enemy evacuating Stony Point, we\r\nonce more took possession of it, with the 42nd, 63rd, and 64th\r\nRegiments. Captain Ferguson is made Governor, and it is now fortifying\r\nwith a close work, which it had not before. The Army is since fallen\r\nback again from Dobbs's Ferry to its former camp at Philipsburg.\"[40]\r\n\r\nThe next event worthy of mention is that described by the Commandant of\r\nNew York as \"a most extraordinary attempt to take by assault the post of\r\nPaulis Hook, that has been occupied by the King's troops ever since they\r\ntook possession of New York.\" This story has been told by American\r\nwriters, but it will be equally interesting to English and American\r\nreaders to have placed before them the official report of the\r\noccurrence, made by General Pattison to Lord Townshend. \"Paulis Hook,\"\r\nwrote the gallant General, \"is on the Jersey shore, opposite to this\r\ntown, and considered as an appendage to it. I am sorry to say the\r\nenterprise, bold as it was, succeeded but too well, and little to the\r\nhonour of the defendants. That your Lordship may judge of the strength\r\nof this post from its natural situation and from the works raised for\r\nits protection, I send the enclosed plan, which will show how far it\r\nought to have been out of the reach of insult. The troops allotted to\r\ngarrison it were the 4th Battalion of Skinner's Provincial Brigade,\r\nunder the command of Colonel Buskirk, and a part of the Invalid\r\nBattalion. Major Sutherland, of the Invalid Battalion, was the\r\nCommandant. On the preceding day it was determined that Colonel Buskirk\r\nshould march out a detachment that evening, with the design of\r\nsurprising a party of 100 rebels near the English neighbourhood. As the\r\ngarrison would thereby be much weakened, the Major applied to me for a\r\nreinforcement for that night of a Captain and forty men, which I\r\ncomplied with, and sent them from the Hessian Regiment of Knyphausen. At\r\nhalf-past three o'clock the next morning advice was brought to me that,—\r\nfiring of musketry being heard at Paulis Hook,—it was probably attacked,\r\nbut having (soon after the command was given me of this garrison)\r\nestablished with Major Sutherland the signal he was to make in case he\r\nshould be attacked in such force as to require succour from hence,—\r\nnamely, to fire two pieces of cannon and to hang out three lights,—and\r\nbeing informed that no cannon had been heard or lights seen, I concluded\r\nthat Buskirk was on his return, and that some small party had been\r\nharassing his rear, the firing at that time having nearly ceased.\r\nHowever, I immediately sent over to know what was the real state of the\r\npost. Upon the return of the messenger, I was filled with astonishment\r\nat receiving a letter from Major Sutherland, saying that the enemy,\r\nhaving got through the abattis, had taken the right-hand and centre\r\nblock-houses and the principal fort, but that the round redoubt, in\r\nwhich was himself, with a Captain and twenty-five Hessians, had been\r\ndefended; that the left block-house was likewise safe; and that the\r\nenemy had retreated, carrying off with them the guards of the two block-\r\nhouses, which (though almost impregnable, except by cannon) were\r\nshamefully abandoned, the detachment of Artillery from the fort, and\r\nsuch officers and soldiers as were in their barracks. He further added\r\nthat he was under great apprehensions of Colonel Buskirk's corps being\r\ncut off. I, thereupon, without loss of time, sent over the flank\r\ncompanies of the Guards, with 100 men from the Brigade, and nearly the\r\nsame number of Hessians, with a party of Artillery, under the command of\r\nthe Field Officer of the day, Lieutenant-Colonel Cosmo Gordon. The light\r\ninfantry were pushed forward about ten miles; and Colonel Buskirk, after\r\nthe _coup manqué_, made his retreat good to Paulis Hook, without any\r\nloss, bringing four prisoners,—and the Guards likewise took a Captain\r\nand six prisoners on their march. What is nearly as extraordinary as the\r\nenterprise itself and the success of it is, that the enemy, though in\r\nfull possession of the fort, did not spike a gun, destroy the\r\nammunition, or do the least injury to any of the buildings. The strength\r\nof the garrison at the time it was assaulted was about 200; and, by the\r\nreturns I have received, there were, _killed_, four sergeants, two\r\ncorporals, and three privates; _wounded_, two sergeants; and, _taken or\r\nmissing_, four subalterns, seven sergeants, five corporals, and ninety-\r\nseven privates. Lieutenant Cockburne, who was the Artillery officer on\r\nduty there, says that a soldier came to the hut where he slept, within\r\nthirty yards of the fort, to give him the alarm; that he instantly flew\r\ntowards the fort, but found the enemy masters of it, whereupon he ran to\r\nthe block-house, and thereby saved himself from being taken prisoner.\r\nThe Commander-in-Chief was pleased to order a Board of two Brigadier-\r\nGenerals and three Field Officers to assemble the day following, to\r\ninquire into the cause of the affront suffered at Paulis Hook on the\r\nmorning of the 19th August, 1779, and to report to him thereupon; and\r\nyesterday, having received the opinion of the Board, he gave orders for\r\nputting Major Sutherland in arrest, and for him to prepare to take his\r\ntrial before a Court-martial, upon a charge of 'general misconduct as\r\nCommandant of Paulis Hook on the morning of the 19th inst.'\" Major\r\nSutherland was ultimately acquitted.\r\n\r\nThe demand for Artillery officers became so great that the Cadets who\r\nwere attached to the companies in America were commissioned as Second\r\nLieutenants in the autumn of 1779, by Sir Henry Clinton, as Commander-\r\nin-Chief, \"to entitle them to sit at Courts-martial and to command as\r\nofficers.\" This step, combined with the removal of many officers, who\r\nwere absent on sick leave, to the new invalid companies, their places\r\nbeing filled with effective officers, rendered the force in America more\r\nefficient than it had been at any previous period of the war.\r\n\r\nWith the year 1780 commenced what may be called the Southern epoch of\r\nthe War of Independence, whose opening scene was successful for the\r\nBritish arms, being the capture by Sir Henry Clinton of Charlestown,\r\nSouth Carolina. Previous to removing so large a portion of the New York\r\ngarrison to assist in his offensive operations, Sir Henry determined to\r\nevacuate Rhode Island, bringing the troops—British and Hessians—with\r\nArtillery and stores, to New York. Private intimation was given to\r\nLieut.-Colonel Innes, who commanded the Artillery on the island, and he\r\nwas thus able to make the necessary preparations for the removal of\r\nstores, ammunition, and horses. With such care and assiduity did he\r\nperform the duty, that when the troops reached New York on the 27th\r\nOctober, 1779, the whole of his guns, stores, and horses—with the\r\nexception of twenty—came with them. The armament of Rhode Island, which\r\nwas thus added to the defences of New York, consisted of 20 field-guns,\r\n9 howitzers, 17 mortars, and 72 iron guns of various calibres. From want\r\nof vessels to convey it, over 1300 tons of hay were left on the island,\r\na commodity which could ill be spared. The enemy made no attempt to\r\nmolest the troops, either during their embarkation or their retreat.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the increase just mentioned to the armament of New York,\r\nthe Commandant was unable with the guns at his command to arm the new\r\nfortifications which he had been making. There is a memorandum in the\r\nRecord Office of the purchase by him of ten 12-pounder iron Swedish guns\r\nfor the new fortified lines near Fort Knyphausen, from the North to the\r\nEast River. These guns were exposed to a careful proof, and were bought\r\nat the rate of 16_l._ per ton.\r\n\r\nIt was immediately after the departure of Sir Henry Clinton's force for\r\nCharlestown that the intense frost occurred, mentioned in the last\r\nchapter as having closed the navigation of New York, and deprived it of\r\nits insular advantages. It had the effect of satisfactorily testing the\r\nloyalty of the inhabitants, and of adding another proof of General\r\nPattison's ability and energy. In a report made by him to Sir Henry\r\nClinton, dated the 21st February, 1780, he sketches the plan he had\r\nresolved on in case of attack; and as it is an interesting contribution\r\nto the History of the War, part of it is now given:—\"As General\r\nKnyphausen and General Tryon were pleased to approve of my disposition\r\nof part of the garrison and militia troops for the internal defence and\r\nsecurity of the city and its vicinity, I take the liberty of enclosing a\r\ncopy of it. If the enemy had crossed over at Harlem, or on the North\r\nRiver anywhere to the south of the line of McGowan's Pass, the 42nd\r\nRegiment, the Brigade of Losberg, and the two Anspach Battalions, were\r\nto have advanced to positions which General Knyphausen had fixed upon,\r\nfrom Colonel Clerke's house to the circular Redoubt on the East River,\r\nand several light field-pieces were fixed upon sleighs, ready to march\r\nto wherever they might be wanted. In the Foundry Redoubt I placed a 24-\r\npounder and two 6-pounders, with a 13-inch mortar, as commanding a long\r\nreach of the North River; and in the new Star Fort near it were added\r\nthree small mortars.\r\n\r\n\"The cannon upon the Fort and batteries were kept loaded; the guard at\r\nyour Excellency's quarters, as well as all the others along the North\r\nRiver, from the time of the ice being passable, were doubled every\r\nevening; and a night piquet of a Captain and fifty men put on board the\r\n'Earl Cornwallis,' Ordnance transport, which was so placed at the Hay\r\nMagazine Wharf that her guns bore up and down the river. An armed galley\r\nwhich lay near had also every evening an officer and twenty-five seamen\r\non board.... I had almost forgot to mention a little Corps formed from\r\nthe Baggage and Store Guards left in town, which might be useful, if\r\ncollected together. I therefore put them under the orders of Major\r\nSmall, and they made—with those he had of the 84th Regiment—upwards of\r\n200 men. I am sorry to have trespassed so much upon your Excellency's\r\ntime by giving this long detail, but think it my duty, Sir, to inform\r\nyou of the several steps and precautions which have been taken for\r\ndischarging the important trust your Excellency was pleased to honour me\r\nwith.... I persuade myself that the recent proofs of loyalty among so\r\nnumerous a body of His Majesty's subjects in this town cannot fail to be\r\nacceptable to your Excellency, and I shall be happy if the endeavours I\r\nhave used to give vigour and exertion to it are so fortunate as to be\r\nhonoured with your approbation. All the Captains of the City Militia, in\r\norder to render it as useful as possible, have agreed to and subscribed\r\ncertain regulations (of which I enclose a copy), for punishing\r\ndelinquents and for keeping in repair and in good condition all their\r\narms, &c.; and in order to their being instructed in the use of them,\r\nthey are to be out every Saturday in the afternoon, and the Associated\r\nVolunteer Companies every Sunday. I would therefore presume to hope,\r\nSir, if your Excellency shall please to approve of their continuing\r\nembodied, that in a short time so respectable a force as 4000 men in\r\narms, with some knowledge in the use of them, may be capable of giving\r\nsuch protection to this city, as may make a garrison of less strength\r\nsufficient in general for the defence of it.\"[41]\r\n\r\nIn a subsequent letter to Lord George Germaine, General Pattison writes\r\nas follows:—\"I will entreat your Lordship's permission to recite further\r\nproof, since the Militia were embodied, of their readiness and goodwill\r\nto aid and assist the public service—a piece of justice I owe them.\r\nAbout ten weeks ago the commanding Engineer applied for a daily working\r\nparty from this garrison of 500 men for completing the _hither_ line of\r\ndefence, agreeable to the orders that were left with him by Sir Henry\r\nClinton, from the North to the East River. As that number could not be\r\ngiven without making the duty of the troops too severe, I sent a\r\nrequisition to the Associated and Militia Companies to furnish a daily\r\nquota of 300 men for the purpose of raising one of the new projected\r\nRedoubts. They most readily acquiesced, and after thirty days' labour\r\nfinished the work in a very complete manner, and with as much\r\ncheerfulness as they began it—_taking neither pay nor provisions_;—and\r\nhaving thus raised a monument to their own credit, I called it the\r\nCitizens' Redoubt, which the Commander-in-Chief has been pleased to\r\nconfirm. A more recent instance of their good disposition to answer one\r\nof the useful ends of their being put into military array was shown upon\r\nthe late move which General Knyphausen made into the Jerseys. It was\r\nthen thought necessary to take over such a force as reduced my garrison\r\nto 700 men. The ordinary guards could not with any safety or propriety\r\nbe lessened below 400. I was therefore under the necessity of calling\r\nupon the Militia to act upon that occasion. They most willingly\r\ncomplied, and furnished 150 men with officers in proportion for many\r\ndays together, which, though attended with loss by quitting their\r\nseveral avocations, was productive of no murmur or discontented\r\nexpressions, and I had often the pleasure to see citizens of large\r\nproperty standing sentinels over public stores and magazines.\"\r\n\r\nThese extracts are interesting to the ordinary reader, as descriptive of\r\nNew York during the British occupation; and especially interesting to\r\nthe Artilleryman as evincing the great tact with which General Pattison\r\nmust have governed the city. The services of the inhabitants were not\r\nmerely acknowledged warmly by Sir Henry Clinton, but also by the King.\r\n\r\nLet the reader now turn for a moment to the military operation which had\r\nbeen the main cause of the reduction of the New York garrison—the Siege\r\nof Charlestown, in South Carolina.\r\n\r\nThe Artillery on this expedition was commanded by Major Traille, or\r\nTraile, an officer who has already been mentioned, and who died, as a\r\nMajor-General, in 1795. The fleet, with the transports, reached Tybee on\r\nthe 1st February, 1780, after a succession of storms;—on the 9th they\r\nsailed for North Ediste; and having reached it on the following day, the\r\nGrenadiers and Light Infantry landed on John's Island, and on the 27th\r\nthe whole army crossed without opposition to James's Island. One of the\r\ntransports, conveying guns and stores, with a detachment of Artillery\r\nunder Captain Collins, foundered at sea during a gale, but fortunately\r\nthe crew and the troops were picked up by a privateer. The stores, which\r\nwere considerable, including 1000 barrels of powder, had to be replaced\r\nfrom New York without delay.\r\n\r\nAs far as can be ascertained from the records, the guns used in the\r\nsiege were 24-pounders and 18-pounders; but a number of 6-pounders and\r\n3-pounders accompanied the force, to be employed in the subsequent field\r\noperations. It was the 1st April before Sir Henry Clinton commenced to\r\nerect his battery, which he did at a distance of 800 yards from the\r\ntown: and by the 19th April the second parallel \"had been carried to 150\r\nyards from the main works, and the (English) batteries had acquired a\r\nmanifest superiority over those of the besieged.\"[42]\r\n\r\nThe services of the fleet under Admiral Arbuthnot had been eminently\r\nuseful. On the 9th April he had availed himself of a fair wind and\r\nflowing tide, and had passed Fort Moultrie—a strong fortification on\r\nSullivan's Island—which was intended to defend the entrance to the bar.\r\nThis step took the Americans by surprise. As Lee writes, the uniformly\r\ncredited opinion that the American naval force could successfully stop\r\nthe enemy from passing the bar—inasmuch as their ships would have to be\r\nlightened, taking out their guns and other incumbrances—was at the\r\nmoment of trial found fallacious. \"It was discovered that the American\r\nfrigates could not approach near enough to oppose the passage of the bar\r\nwith any kind of success; and we necessarily abandoned without a\r\nstruggle this point of defence so much relied on.\"[43] The summons to\r\nsurrender immediately followed; and the answer was that \"duty and\r\ninclination point to the propriety of supporting it to the last\r\nextremity.\" General Lincoln was in command of the garrison—an able and\r\ncourageous officer, and one who possesses additional interest in the\r\neyes of Royal Artillerymen from the fact that he was subsequently\r\nexchanged for their brave brother officer, General Phillips, of whom\r\nmore will have to be said in this chapter.\r\n\r\nThe siege was conducted sternly and without intermission. In the words\r\nof the American historian \"the answer was no sooner received than the\r\nBritish batteries commenced the dire assault, which continued without\r\nintermission.\" The investiture of Charlestown, by extending his\r\noperations to the north of Cooper's River, was Sir Henry Clinton's next\r\nobject. By detaching 1500 men under an excellent officer Lieut.-Colonel\r\nWebster, and another whose reputation as a dashing officer has lived\r\nlonger among his enemies than his friends, Lieut.-Colonel Tarleton, he\r\ncompletely succeeded in his purpose. Further reinforcements from New\r\nYork enabled Clinton to strengthen this belt—which prevented the retreat\r\nof the Charlestown garrison—and Lord Cornwallis assumed the command of\r\nthe forces on the land side. Then followed in rapid succession the\r\nsurrender of Mount Pleasant, Lempriere, and Wando posts, and Fort\r\nMoultrie itself. \"Soon followed the completion of the third parallel,\r\nwhich placed the garrison at the mercy of the besiegers. Unwilling, from\r\nmotives of humanity, to increase the hardships of the unfortunate, the\r\nBritish Admiral and General a second time demanded surrender. Lincoln,\r\nnow, from necessity, yielded up his army; but still, anxious to save the\r\nmilitia and inhabitants from captivity, he excepted them in his\r\nassenting answer, which exception being declared inadmissible, the\r\nnegotiation ceased. Reluctantly Sir Henry Clinton renewed the contest by\r\nopening the batteries of the third parallel, and pushed his works under\r\ntheir fire to the brink of the canal, which by a sap to the dam was\r\ndrained.... The inhabitants became assured that the concluding scene\r\ncould not long be deferred, and though heretofore devoted to the defence\r\nof the town, now with one accord supplicated General Lincoln to\r\nrelinquish the exception made in their favour, and to accept the terms\r\nproffered. The amiable Lincoln could no longer hesitate in stopping the\r\neffusion of blood. He communicated to Sir Henry Clinton his readiness to\r\nlay down his arms upon the conditions before offered. Highly honourable\r\nwas the conduct of the British commanders. They did not press the\r\nunfortunate, but agreed that the terms before rejected should form the\r\nbasis of capitulation, which being soon prepared, signed, and ratified,\r\nCharlestown was surrendered on the 12th May, 1780, six days after the\r\nparallel was finished.\"[44]\r\n\r\nDaring, or rather immediately after, the siege, a painful occurrence\r\ntook place, which is thus alluded to in a report from the officer\r\ncommanding the Royal Artillery:—\"Although your Lordship is doubtless in\r\npossession of all the essential particulars relative to the reduction of\r\nCharlestown, I nevertheless beg leave to enclose the copy of the return\r\nI received from Major Traille of the killed and wounded during the siege\r\nof that town. I most sincerely regret the loss of that valuable officer,\r\nCaptain Collins, as well as the rest who shared his unhappy fate. The\r\nmisfortune was owing to the incautious proceedings in collecting and\r\nassorting the arms of the rebel prisoners in a house where a quantity of\r\npowder happened to be lodged. Besides the officers and soldiers, there\r\nwas a conductor of stores and several artificers who perished by this\r\naccident.\"[45]\r\n\r\nThe rejoicings in New York on receipt of the intelligence of the fall of\r\nCharlestown are thus described in the Commandant's official report:—\"We\r\nwere made happy in the fullest degree by the glad tidings of the\r\nsurrender of Charlestown and its garrison. So universal a joy was spread\r\non the occasion in this city as was never known before; and if there be\r\nany who do not really feel it, they at least affect to express it.\r\nPermit me, Sir, with the most heartfelt satisfaction to offer my\r\ncongratulations upon this glorious event.\"[45]\r\n\r\nIn writing to Major Traille, General Pattison said:—\"The encomium you\r\ngive of the good behaviour of the officers and men of the Artillery\r\nduring the siege of Charlestown cannot fail to be very agreeable to me.\r\nI sincerely regret the loss of poor Collins, and all who shared his\r\nunhappy fate. The escape young Macleod had upon that occasion was very\r\nfortunate.\"[45]\r\n\r\nIn a very short time after the fall of Charlestown, South Carolina was\r\ncleared of rebels by the English troops, and Sir Henry Clinton returned\r\nto New York, leaving Lord Cornwallis in command.\r\n\r\nThe state of affairs in America at this time cannot but awaken comment\r\nand speculation in the student's mind. The speculation may be idle, but\r\nit is instinctive. What was the state of the rebel army at this time? of\r\nthe rebel Government? of the rebel fleet? Let their own historian—so\r\noften quoted here—reply. The army was demoralized, neglected, almost\r\nmutinous. The Government was imbecile, interfering, and incapable. As to\r\nnaval operations, Lee's own words were as follows:—\"Every attempt made\r\nby the naval force of the enemy during the war succeeded: ... and many\r\nsuch operations took place.\" And yet we lost our colonies.\r\n\r\nNew York was ours,—thoroughly, loyally ours, in spite of all that\r\nAmerican writers may say. Canada was ours; then, as now, loyal and true.\r\nThe great Middle and Western States did not exist, which now so swell\r\nthe strength of the great Republic in riches and in muscle. And yet we\r\nlost our colonies.\r\n\r\nOur fleets more than matched their foes; our soldiers fought then as\r\nwell as they have ever fought since. The Peninsula, the Crimea, India\r\nitself, cannot show in their annals more determined courage than was\r\nshown in the English ranks between 1775 and 1781. And yet we lost our\r\ncolonies.\r\n\r\nWhere was the weak place in our harness? God help us! it was where it\r\nwill be again if Englishmen do not take care; if Englishmen do not sink\r\nclass and party differences when the word is given to fight; if\r\nEnglishmen do not remember that a nation is weak when disunited, and its\r\narmy at such a time is weaker still.\r\n\r\nThere was another weak point, and to it we must now come in our\r\nnarrative. Our Generals during this great war were brave; they were even\r\nin their way able; and, as we have seen, they were frequently\r\nsuccessful. But they were in presence of a Master. Pettiness, obstinacy,\r\nblundering, on the part of his Government might vex and weary\r\nWashington; reluctance and timidity on the part of his allies might at\r\ntimes nearly ruin his plans; but his courage, his skill, his confident\r\nhope, survived and surmounted all obstacles. If one reckons up the\r\nqualities which make a General, we shall find he possessed them all.\r\nPatriotism—it was his almost to an exaggerated extent; for, having once\r\nadopted a view which he considered patriotic, he did not care to reason.\r\nEnthusiasm—would God that every man who draws a sword for England had\r\nbut one-half of that which swelled Washington's bosom! Purity of\r\nmotives—who can think of the scenes which are now historical, when he\r\nwould have resigned the power he had so justly earned, without feeling\r\n(even after all these years) that he is in the antechamber of a man who\r\nwas pure and above reproach? And skill—if any man doubts it, let him\r\nthink of that scene at Yorktown to which this chapter slowly leads. To\r\nsee one's schemes mature so surely and so happily is the highest reward\r\nfor his exertions for which a General can hope; and as in this case it\r\nimplied that independence for his country which had been his sole and\r\nunselfish aim, one can conceive Washington ready, even then, to resign\r\nhis command and sheath his sword.\r\n\r\nHe was to America what Wallace was to Scotland, and Garibaldi to Italy;\r\nbut he had a larger sphere of action than the former, and a more\r\nstatesmanlike mind than the latter.\r\n\r\nWith dissension at home, and Washington against them in the field, who\r\ncan wonder that, in spite of continued courage and spasmodic success,\r\nour armies failed to secure our colonies?\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was an acting-bombardier in the Royal Artillery, named Richard\r\nAtkinson Boddy, who died at Woolwich on the 18th January, 1837. Animated\r\nby the same desire which has filled the breast of many an Artilleryman,\r\nto commemorate in some durable form the services of his corps,\r\nBombardier Boddy commenced to make extracts from all military histories\r\nwhich touched on the subject which he had so strongly at heart. A\r\nmanuscript volume of such extracts was left by him at his death, and was\r\nthus alluded to in his will:—\"To the library of the non-commissioned\r\nofficers of the Royal Artillery I bequeath a manuscript book of the\r\nservices of many of the officers, written by myself. In the event of the\r\ndissolution of the library, I will that the book do revert to my\r\nfather.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the extracts contained in this volume are three, referring to the\r\noperations in America subsequent to the capture of Charlestown, and\r\ndescribing in detail the affairs known as Camden, Ninety-six, and\r\nGuildford.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to other operations, the result of Bombardier Boddy's\r\nindustry will be communicated to the reader. And if by means of this\r\nwork any tribute can be paid to the memory of a non-commissioned\r\nofficer, whose _esprit_, diligence, and unselfish labour are well worthy\r\nof imitation, not merely will justice have been done, but others may be\r\ninspired to follow his example. There is no rank in the service in which\r\nmen may not do something,—not merely to add to, but also to commemorate,\r\nthe distinction of the corps in which they serve. In the case of the\r\nRoyal Artillery this has been emphatically proved, not merely by the\r\nindustrious labourer now mentioned, but also by one already quoted, the\r\nauthor of 'England's Artillerymen.'[46]\r\n\r\nThe Battle of Camden was fought on the 16th August, 1780. Lord\r\nCornwallis commanded the English troops, whose total strength did not\r\nexceed 2000. General Gates—who had received General Burgoyne's\r\nsubmission at Saratoga—commanded the Americans, who were nearly 6000 in\r\nnumber. The Royal Artillery was represented by two subalterns (one of\r\nwhom, Lieutenant William Marquois, died on the 15th October of wounds\r\nreceived during this action), two sergeants, and fifteen men. In spite\r\nof the disparity of strength, so complete was the victory of the English\r\nthat 1000 of the enemy were killed or wounded; the pursuit by Colonel\r\nTarleton and the English cavalry extended as far as twenty-two miles;\r\nthe whole of the enemy's artillery, a large number of waggons, and 2000\r\nstand of arms were captured; and \"of the 6000 men who composed Gates's\r\narmy, not sixty could have again been collected.\"[47] The English\r\nregiments which most distinguished themselves were the 23rd, 33rd, and\r\n71st, under Colonel Webster; and the heaviest loss fell upon the 33rd.\r\nFour guns were present with the Royal Artillery; but on account of the\r\nsmall number of gunners, men from the Line or volunteers must have\r\nassisted in working them. The total number of casualties on the English\r\nside was as follows—_killed_, 70; and _wounded_, 250.\r\n\r\nThe affair called \"Ninety-six\" in the MS. volume referred to is\r\nidentical with that known as the \"Battle of Cowpens.\" On this occasion\r\nthe British were totally defeated, with a loss of their guns, two in\r\nnumber. Fortunately for the Royal Artillery, almost equal satisfaction\r\ncan be obtained from this defeat as from many victories. Lord\r\nCornwallis, in his despatch to Sir Henry Clinton, wrote as follows:—\"In\r\njustice to the detachment of Royal Artillery, I must here observe that\r\nno terror could induce them to quit their guns, and they were all killed\r\nor wounded in defence of them.\" This engagement took place in January,\r\n1781.\r\n\r\nThe last of the three actions mentioned in the extracts referred to, is\r\nthat known as the \"Battle of Guildford.\" It was a victory for the\r\nEnglish arms, but a most expensive one. Nearly one-third of the Royal\r\nArmy was left _hors de combat_. The Royal Artillery lost only Lieutenant\r\nAugustus O'Hara and one gunner killed, and four men wounded. Lord\r\nCornwallis could not afford to follow up the victory; and although he\r\ncaptured the enemy's artillery, and the American losses far exceeded\r\nthat of the English, there is no doubt that from this day the American\r\nspirits rose, and Lord Cornwallis's position became serious. The Battle\r\nof Guildford was fought in March, 1781. The American force was 5000\r\nstrong, but about one-half was composed of militiamen, who were of\r\nlittle use, and who fled to their homes after the battle. The total\r\nstrength of the British force did not exceed 2400 of all ranks. Soon\r\nafter the battle, Cornwallis had to commence a retreat.\r\n\r\nIt was in this battle that Lieutenant Macleod of the Royal Artillery—\r\nafterwards Sir John Macleod—behaved with a skill and gallantry which\r\nLord Cornwallis never forgot. If the commendation of his own commanding\r\nofficer must have been agreeable, how much more that of his enemies! Lee\r\nin describing this battle, of which he says, \"On no occasion, in any\r\npart of the world, was British valour more heroically displayed,\"\r\nsingles out young Macleod more than once for conspicuous notice. On one\r\noccasion he says that one battalion, which at a critical period had been\r\ndriven back with slaughter, had \"its remains saved by the British\r\nArtillery.\"\r\n\r\nLeaving now these three engagements, the reader is requested to turn to\r\nan operation in the war, in which the _Commander_ of the English forces\r\nwas an Artilleryman.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of 1781 Major-General Phillips, of the Royal Artillery,\r\nwho had been a prisoner since the convention at Saratoga, was exchanged\r\nfor the American General Lincoln. He was immediately appointed, by Sir\r\nHenry Clinton, to the command of a force of 2000 men to watch the French\r\nand prevent them from sailing for the south. He was then ordered to\r\nVirginia, to join General Arnold's force, which had been ravaging the\r\ncountry almost unopposed, but which was now in a somewhat hazardous\r\nposition. On effecting the junction with Arnold, General Phillips\r\nassumed the command of the united force, numbering now about 3500 men.\r\nIt was a change for the better in every way. Arnold was disliked by all\r\nunder his command, for they never could forget that he was a traitor;\r\nand as a soldier he was in every way inferior to Phillips. Among the\r\nregiments forming the force for the service on which Phillips was to be\r\nengaged in Virginia were the 76th, 80th, Simcoe's Queen's Rangers, some\r\nGerman troops, and Arnold's American Legion. On the 19th April General\r\nPhillips proceeded up James River to Barwell's Ferry, and on the 20th he\r\nlanded at Williamsburg, a body of the enemy's militia retiring on his\r\napproach. On the 22nd he marched to Chickahominy; and on the 25th,—early\r\nin the forenoon,—he set his army in motion for Petersburg, reaching it\r\nin the evening. A small encounter with some militia took place when\r\nwithin a mile of the town, in which the rebels were defeated, with a\r\nloss of 100 killed and wounded. Lee, in his 'Memoirs of the War in the\r\nSouthern Departments,' writes very severely of the way in which\r\nuntrained militia were exposed by the American Government to the attacks\r\nof regular troops. His strictures, and the lesson he draws from the\r\nexperiences of this raid in Virginia, are worthy of quotation at a time\r\nwhen it is becoming more generally recognized in England that the\r\nprofession of arms is one requiring special training as much as any\r\nother. \"What ills,\" he writes, \"spring from the timidity and impotence\r\nof rulers! In them attachment to the common cause is vain and illusory,\r\nunless guided, in times of difficulty, by courage, wisdom, and\r\nconcert.... Whenever the commitment of our militia in battle with\r\nregulars occurs, the heart of the writer is rent with painful emotions,\r\nknowing, as he does, the waste of life resulting from the stupid, cruel\r\npolicy. Can there be any system devised by the wit of man more the\r\ncompound of inhumanity, of murder, and of waste? Ought any Government to\r\nbe respected which, when peace permits the substitution of a better\r\nsystem, neglects to avail itself of the opportunity? Were a father to\r\nput his son, with his small sword drawn for the first time, against an\r\nexperienced swordsman, would not his neighbours exclaim, 'Murderer! vile\r\nmurderer!' Just so acts the Government, and yet our parents are all\r\nsatisfied, although whenever war takes place, their sons are to be led\r\nto the altar of blood. Dreadful apathy! shocking coldness to our\r\nprogeny!\"\r\n\r\nIn Petersburg, and, indeed, wherever the British troops went in\r\nVirginia, all military stores belonging to the rebels were destroyed,\r\nand the warehouses with their cargoes of tobacco and flour were\r\nsystematically burnt. Lee is very severe in his description of this\r\nmethod of warfare, very bitter in his denunciations of the human\r\nvultures who follow conquering armies, and very ironical in his\r\nallusions to the tobacco war carried on by the English; and yet, in the\r\nsame breath, he admits that no human foe went out to meet them and give\r\nthem battle; that everywhere there was, on the part of the Americans, \"a\r\nfatal want of preparation, of military apparatus, and of system.\" Wanton\r\nand purposeless devastation is strongly to be deprecated in war; but was\r\nthis raid a purposeless one? The garrison of New York had been wofully\r\nweakened, and the English troops in the south were at times dangerously\r\ndivided. If the American armies could not be drawn apart to meet the\r\nEnglish by hope of victory, perhaps they might be tempted by the hope of\r\nsaving Virginia from this \"so dreadful visitation, precursor of famine\r\nand of plague.\"[48] Doubtless there was this strategic purpose in the\r\nVirginian raid, just as there was later in the raid in Connecticut, by\r\nwhich Clinton hoped to tempt Washington back from that dreaded march\r\nwhich culminated so triumphantly for him at Yorktown.\r\n\r\nAgain, even admitting irregularities and excesses not to be justified by\r\nstrategy (although this need only be done for the sake of argument, so\r\nmuch exaggeration is there in the American accounts of this expedition),\r\nwere there not special reasons which might lead one to expect them? Who\r\nfilled the ranks of the American Loyalist Regiments which fought under\r\nPhillips and Arnold? They were men who had lost everything for their\r\nKing, whose homes had been confiscated, and who had been outlawed and\r\nexecrated by their countrymen because, forsooth, they had come to a\r\ndifferent opinion on a political question. Were these the men to walk\r\nthrough the enemy's country with dainty step and gloved hand? There is\r\nsomething brutalizing in war under the most favourable conditions; but\r\nwhen the combatants commence with feelings of hatred and thirst for\r\nrevenge, he would indeed be a rare disciplinarian who could prevent an\r\noccasional outbreak in the course of a continued and successful\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th April, 1781, General Phillips, with his force, marched for\r\nChesterfield Court-house, and detached General Arnold to a place called\r\nOsborne's. According to some accounts, the two forces had again met\r\nbefore the circumstance occurred which is now to be related; but,\r\naccording to a manuscript book in the Royal Artillery Record Office, it\r\nwas while some guns were attached to General Arnold's detached force. It\r\nis not very material, but as it is to the credit of the regiment whose\r\nservices these pages commemorate, one would rather believe that General\r\nPhillips,—an Artilleryman himself,—had been in command, than General\r\nArnold. Some armed vessels had been collected in James River for a\r\nspecial purpose by the Americans, and either the whole or part of\r\nPhillips' force marched with a view to secure them. In reply to a\r\nsummons to surrender, the Commodore replied that he was determined to\r\ndefend himself to the last extremity.\r\n\r\nTwo 6-pounders and two 3-pounders (the latter called \"grasshoppers\" in\r\nLee's account, a favourite nickname for these guns, although sternly\r\nforbidden to be used in any official returns to the Commanding Officer\r\nof Artillery) were then taken to the banks of the river, with a\r\ndetachment of the Royal Artillery, under Captain Fage and Lieutenant\r\nRogers. The King's troops were exposed to the fire of the 'Tempest,'\r\ntwenty guns; the 'Renown,' twenty-six; the 'Jefferson,' fourteen; and\r\nseveral smaller vessels. Some few hundred Militia also kept up a fire\r\nfrom the other bank of the river. It does not say much, for the American\r\nfire to find it recorded that not a single English soldier was hurt. The\r\nfire of the Royal Artillery seems to have been of a very different\r\ndescription. According to one account, so effectual was it, that, in a\r\nvery short time, the ships were obliged to strike their colours, and the\r\nMilitia were driven from the opposite shore. From want of boats the\r\nEnglish were unable to secure their prizes; and the Americans made their\r\nescape, scuttling some of their vessels and setting fire to others. The\r\nloss of the enemy, according to this account, was very great, \"owing to\r\nthe well-directed fire of the British Artillery.\" Lee's account is as\r\nfollows: \"Quickly two sixes and two grasshoppers were brought to bear\r\nupon the Commodore; when he as quickly scuttled and set fire to his\r\nvessels, escaping, with his crew, to the northern banks of the river,—\r\none way of 'holding out to the last extremity,' but not that commonly\r\nunderstood by the term.\" Among the many services in which the Artillery\r\nwas engaged during the American War, perhaps none were quainter than\r\nthis successful duel between four light field-pieces and an armed\r\nsquadron of no inconsiderable strength, supported by troops on shore.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th April General Phillips marched, with the main body, in the\r\ndirection of Manchester, which he reached on the following day, and\r\nwhere he destroyed a quantity of stores. General Arnold went, with the\r\nremainder of the troops, up the river in boats. Although the Marquis de\r\nla Fayette, with a considerable force, was at Richmond, and saw what was\r\nbeing done, he made no attempt to stop the damage; and on the following\r\nday General Phillips returned to Osborne's, where the engagement with\r\nthe ships had taken place. Here he became seriously unwell, with a bad\r\nform of fever; and although he lingered to the 13th May, he was unable\r\nto perform any active duty, and was carried about in a vehicle until\r\nunable longer to leave his couch. The army had reached Petersburg before\r\nhe died. This place is described by Lee as \"the great mart of that\r\nsection of the State which lies south of the Appomattox, and of the\r\nnorthern part of North Carolina, standing upon its banks about twelve\r\nmiles from City Point, and, after the destruction of Norfolk, ranking\r\nfirst among the commercial towns of the State.\" To the Royal\r\nArtilleryman this Virginian town will always have a peculiar interest,\r\nas having been the scene of the death of as brave and honourable a\r\nsoldier as ever served in the Regiment. From the glorious day at Minden,\r\nhis professional career of more than one-and-twenty years had been one\r\nof credit to his corps, honour to himself, and usefulness to his\r\ncountry. He had been thirteen years in the Regiment before the Battle of\r\nMinden, so that his total service when he died exceeded thirty-four\r\nyears. He was beloved by all who served with him, and was a model for\r\nArtillerymen to imitate, in gallantry, ability, and _progress_. He was\r\neminently a progressive officer.\r\n\r\nWith September, 1781, came the commencement of the operations which\r\nvirtually terminated the war. Sir Henry Clinton and Lord Cornwallis held\r\ndifferent opinions as to the mode of prosecuting the war in Virginia:\r\nthe former devoting his energies to the defence of New York; the latter\r\nanxious for increased numbers with which to carry on offensive\r\noperations. The Home Government was eager to secure some point on the\r\nsouthern coast, where the Army and Navy could mutually assist one\r\nanother, and such a point Cornwallis was ordered by Sir Henry Clinton to\r\nsecure. The place ultimately selected by him was a village called\r\nYorktown, on a peninsula between James and York Rivers, along with the\r\nadjoining village of Gloucester, on the other bank of York River. This\r\nposition he fortified to the utmost of his power, and communicated with\r\nSir Henry Clinton at New York, with a view to reinforcements being sent\r\nto his assistance. Washington had completely deceived Clinton, and had\r\ninduced him to believe that New York, not Virginia, was the object of\r\nthe proposed operations of himself and his French allies. Taken by\r\nsurprise by the sudden movement to the South now made by Washington and\r\nhis forces, Clinton endeavoured to recall him by invading Connecticut,\r\nbut without success; and having received an urgent letter from\r\nCornwallis on the 23rd September, he called a Council of War, and on the\r\n24th he wrote, promising to start about the 5th October with 5000 troops\r\nand twenty-three men-of-war to relieve him. Had he fulfilled his\r\npromise, a great disaster would have been spared; but instead of leaving\r\non the 5th, it was not until the 19th,—the very day that Cornwallis,\r\nafter a weary fortnight's expectation, had been obliged to surrender,—\r\nthat he left Sandyhook; nor did he arrive off the Capes of Virginia\r\nuntil the 24th.\r\n\r\nOf the gallantry of Cornwallis and his troops there has never been any\r\nquestion. He did not surrender until his ammunition was expended, his\r\ndefences crumbled under the enemy's fire, and hope of succour completely\r\nfled. Of the gallantry of that portion of his troops in which the reader\r\nof these pages is most interested, he himself thus wrote in his official\r\ndespatches: \"Captain Rochfort, who commanded the Artillery, and, indeed,\r\nevery officer and soldier of that distinguished Corps, have merited, in\r\nevery respect, my highest approbation.\"\r\n\r\nThe force of Royal Artillery present at the capitulation of Yorktown\r\namounted to 167 of all ranks. The largest number whom Lord Cornwallis\r\nhad commanded during his Virginian campaign did not exceed 233, with\r\nfifty additional German Artillerymen. But, in addition to casualties\r\nbefore the investment of Yorktown, the loss to the Royal Artillery\r\nduring the time between the 27th September and the 19th October,—the\r\ndate of the capitulation,—was as follows:—\r\n\r\n                               Killed  24\r\n                               Wounded 21\r\n                               Missing  2\r\n\r\nThere were also nineteen sick, in addition to the wounded, on the day\r\nthe garrison surrendered.\r\n\r\nIn this crowning point of the American War the defenders were as much\r\noutnumbered as Sir Henry Clinton was out-manœuvred by Washington. It is\r\nimpossible to praise too highly the tactics of the latter General on\r\nthis occasion. The difficulties with which he had to contend were\r\nnumerous. A spirit of discontent and insubordination had been manifested\r\nduring the past year among his troops; there was a Loyalist party of no\r\nmean dimensions in the South; in Pennsylvania he could reckon on few\r\nactive supporters; and New York,—stronger now than ever, after six years\r\nof British occupation,—seemed hopelessly unattainable. Worse than all,\r\nhowever, the French Admiral was nervous, and reluctant to remain in so\r\ncramped a situation with so large a fleet. Had he carried out his threat\r\nof going to sea, instead of yielding to Washington's earnest entreaties\r\nand remonstrances, the capitulation would never have taken place. Lee's\r\ndescription of the scene on the day the garrison marched out is doubly\r\ninteresting, as being that of a spectator: \"At two o'clock in the\r\nevening the British Army, led by General O'Hara, marched out of its\r\nlines with colours cased and drums beating a British march. The author\r\nwas present at the ceremony; and certainly no spectacle could be more\r\nimpressive than the one now exhibited. Valiant troops yielding up their\r\narms after fighting in defence of a cause dear to them (because the\r\ncause of their country), under a leader who, throughout the war, in\r\nevery grade and in every situation to which he had been called, appeared\r\nthe Hector of his host. Battle after battle had he fought; climate after\r\nclimate had he endured; towns had yielded to his mandate; posts were\r\nabandoned at his approach; armies were conquered by his prowess—one\r\nnearly exterminated, another chased from the confines of South Carolina\r\nbeyond the Dan into Virginia, and a third severely chastised in that\r\nState, on the shores of James River. But here even he, in the midst of\r\nhis splendid career, found his conqueror.\r\n\r\n\"The road through which they marched was lined with spectators, French\r\nand American. On one side the Commander-in-chief, surrounded by his\r\nsuite and the American staff, took his station; on the other side,\r\nopposite to him, was the Count de Rochambeau in like manner attended.\r\nThe captive army approached, moving slowly in column with grace and\r\nprecision. Universal silence was observed amidst the vast concourse, and\r\nthe utmost decency prevailed; exhibiting in demeanour an awful sense of\r\nthe vicissitudes of human fortune, mingled with commiseration for the\r\nunhappy.... Every eye was turned, searching for the British Commander-\r\nin-chief, anxious to look at that man, heretofore so much the object of\r\ntheir dread. All were disappointed. Cornwallis held himself back from\r\nthe humiliating scene, obeying emotions which his great character ought\r\nto have stifled. He had been unfortunate, not from any false step or\r\ndeficiency of exertion on his part, but from the infatuated policy of\r\nhis superior, and the united power of his enemy, brought to bear upon\r\nhim alone. There was nothing with which he could reproach himself: there\r\nwas nothing with which he could reproach his brave and faithful army:\r\nwhy not then appear at its head in the day of misfortune, as he had\r\nalways done in the day of triumph? The British General in this instance\r\ndeviated from his usual line of conduct, dimming the splendour of his\r\nlong and brilliant career.... By the official returns it appears that\r\nthe besieging army, at the termination of the siege, amounted to 16,000\r\nmen, viz. 5500 Continentals, 3500 militia, and 7000 French. The British\r\nforce _in toto_ is put down at 7107; of whom only 4017 rank and file are\r\nstated to have been fit for duty.\"\r\n\r\nWith this misfortune virtually ends the History of the American War,—\r\ncertainly as far as the Royal Artillery's services are concerned.\r\nAnother year, and more, was to pass ere even the preliminaries of the\r\nTreaty of Independence should be signed; and not until 1783 was Peace\r\nofficially proclaimed: but a new Government came into power in England\r\nin the beginning of 1782, one of whose political cries was \"Peace with\r\nthe American Colonies!\"; and Rodney's glorious victory over the French\r\nfleet on the 12th April in that year made the Americans eager to meet\r\nthe advances of the parent country.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Clinton resigned in favour of Sir Guy Carleton, and Washington\r\nremained in Philadelphia. The companies of Artillery were detailed to\r\nproceed to Canada, Nova Scotia, the West Indies, and a proportion to\r\nEngland, on the evacuation of New York, which took place in 1783; the\r\nTreaty of Peace having been signed on the 3rd September in that year at\r\nVersailles. The same Treaty brought peace between England and her other\r\nenemies, France and Spain, who had availed themselves of her American\r\ntroubles to avenge, as they hoped, former injuries.\r\n\r\nAs far as comfort and satisfaction can be obtained from the study of an\r\nunsuccessful war, they can be got by the Royal Artilleryman in tracing\r\nthe services of his Corps during the great war in America. Bravery,\r\nzeal, and readiness to endure hardship, adorn even a defeated army; and\r\nthese qualities were in a high, and even eminent degree, manifested by\r\nthe Royal Artillery. In the blaze of triumph which is annually renewed\r\nin America on the anniversary of their Declaration of Independence,\r\nAmericans do not, it is hoped, forget that, whether England's cause was\r\njust or not, her soldiers were as brave as themselves.\r\n\r\nA few words may here be introduced with reference to such of the\r\nofficers of the Regiment as were engaged in this war, and afterwards\r\nobtained high professional reputation. A summary of their services may\r\nbe taken from the valuable Appendix to Kane's List. In addition to\r\nGeneral Pattison, whose career has already been sketched, the following\r\nofficers may be mentioned:—\r\n\r\n1. Major-General THOMAS JAMES, an officer who held a command during the\r\nearly part of the War of Independence; who wrote a valuable work on\r\nGibraltar, entitled \"The Herculean Straits;\" and who died in 1780, as a\r\nColonel-Commandant.\r\n\r\n2. Lieut.-General S. CLEAVELAND, an officer who has already been\r\nmentioned as having commanded the Royal Artillery during the American\r\nWar, prior to the arrival of General Pattison; who had previously served\r\nin the West Indies and at the capture of the Havannah; and who died in\r\n1794, also in the rank of Colonel-Commandant.\r\n\r\n3. Lieut.-General F. MACBEAN, an officer frequently mentioned in this\r\nvolume, as having been present at Fontenoy, Rocour, Laffeldt, Minden,\r\nWarberg, Fritzlar, and in Portugal. He was appointed to the command of\r\nthe Royal Artillery in Canada, in 1778; was elected a Fellow of the\r\nRoyal Society in 1786; and died in 1800, as Colonel-Commandant of the\r\nInvalid Battalion.\r\n\r\n4. Major-General W. PHILLIPS has already been repeatedly noticed in this\r\nvolume, and his death during the war already recorded.\r\n\r\n5. General Sir A. FARRINGTON, Bart., served in America from 1764 to\r\n1768, and from 1773 to 1783, having been engaged in most of the\r\nengagements during the war, up to the Capture of Philadelphia, after\r\nwhich he commanded the Artillery in Halifax, Nova Scotia. \"He commanded\r\nthe Royal Artillery at Plymouth in 1788-9, at Gibraltar in 1790-1, at\r\nWoolwich 1794-7 and in Holland in 1799. He was D.C.L. of Oxford, and in\r\nconsideration of his long and valued services he was created a Baronet,\r\non the 3rd October, 1818. He served in three reigns, for the long period\r\nof sixty-eight years, being at the time of his death the oldest officer\r\nin the British service, retaining the use of his faculties, and\r\nperforming the functions of his office to the last.\"[49]\r\n\r\n6. Lieutenant-General THOMAS DAVIES is thus mentioned in Kane's List:\r\n\"He saw much service in North America during the operations connected\r\nwith the conquest of Canada. At one time (while a Lieutenant) he\r\ncommanded a naval force on Lake Champlain, and took a French frigate of\r\neighteen guns after a close action of nearly three hours. Lieutenant\r\nDavies hoisted the first British flag in Montreal. He served as Captain\r\nof a Company in the most important actions of the American Revolutionary\r\nWar. During his long service he had command of the Royal Artillery at\r\nCoxheath Camp; also at Gibraltar, in Canada, and at Plymouth. He was\r\nalso two years Commandant of Quebec.\" This officer joined as a cadet in\r\n1755, and died as a Colonel-Commandant in 1799.\r\n\r\n7. General Sir THOMAS BLOMEFIELD will receive more detailed notice when\r\nthe story of the Copenhagen expedition, in 1807, comes to be written in\r\nthese pages. His services during the American War are thus summarised by\r\nKane's List: \"In 1776, Captain Blomefield proceeded to America as\r\nBrigade-Major to Brigadier Phillips. Among his services at this period\r\nwas the construction of floating batteries upon the Canadian Lakes; and\r\nhe was actively engaged with the army under General Burgoyne until the\r\naction which preceded the unfortunate convention of Saratoga, when he\r\nwas severely wounded by a musket-shot in the head. In 1780 Captain\r\nBlomefield was appointed Inspector of Artillery, and of the Brass\r\nFoundry.... From this period (1783) dates the high character of British\r\ncast-iron and brass ordnance. Major-General Blomefield was selected, in\r\n1807, to command the Artillery in the expedition to Copenhagen, and\r\nreceived for his services on this occasion the thanks of both Houses of\r\nParliament and a baronetcy.\" He died as a Colonel-Commandant on 24th\r\nAugust, 1822.\r\n\r\n8. Major-General ROBERT DOUGLAS has already been mentioned for his\r\ngallantry as a subaltern during the American War. In 1795 he was\r\nappointed Commandant of the Driver Corps, an office which he held until\r\n1817. He died at Woolwich, in 1827, as a Colonel-Commandant of a\r\nBattalion.\r\n\r\n9. Lieutenant-General Sir JOHN MACLEOD has already been mentioned in\r\nconnection with the Battle of Guildford, and will receive more detailed\r\nnotice in the next volume, his own history and that of his Regiment\r\nbeing indissolubly woven together. It may here be mentioned, however,\r\nthat, \"on his return from America, he was placed on the Staff of the\r\nMaster-General; and from this time till his death he was employed in the\r\nimportant duties of the organization of the Regiment, and of the\r\narrangement and equipment of the Artillery for all the expeditions (of\r\nwhich there were no fewer than eleven) during this period. He held\r\nsuccessively the appointments of Chief of the Ordnance Staff, Deputy-\r\nAdjutant-General, and Director-General of Artillery. He commanded the\r\nRoyal Artillery during the expedition to Walcheren in 1809. In 1820\r\nGeorge IV., desirous of marking his sense of his long and important\r\nservices, conferred on him the honour of knighthood, and invested him\r\nwith the Grand Cross of the Royal Guelphic Order.\"[50] The whole of his\r\nofficial letter-books, during the time he was Deputy-Adjutant-General of\r\nArtillery, are deposited in the Royal Artillery Record Office, and\r\nafford a priceless historical mine to the student. His letters are\r\ndistinguished by rare ability and punctilious courtesy.\r\n\r\n10. General Sir JOHN SMITH, who had been in Canada since 1773, was taken\r\nprisoner by the rebels, at St. John's, in November, 1775. In 1777 he was\r\nexchanged, served under Sir William Howe, and was present at Brandywine\r\nCreek, Germantown, the Siege of Charlestown, and at Yorktown. He\r\ncommanded the Artillery under Sir Ralph Abercromby in the West Indies in\r\n1795; accompanied the Duke of York to Holland in 1799; and served at\r\nGibraltar from 1804 to 1814, being Governor of the place at the\r\nconclusion of his service. He died as Colonel-Commandant in July, 1837.\r\n\r\nLastly may be mentioned Lieut.-General Sir EDWARD HOWORTH, one of the\r\nofficers taken prisoner at Saratoga. He commanded the Royal Artillery in\r\nlater years at the battles of Talavera, Busaco, and Fuentes d'Onore. He\r\ndied as Colonel-Commandant of a Battalion in 1821.\r\n\r\nThe reader will now enter upon a region of statistics, which, at the\r\ndate of the publication of the present work, possess a peculiar\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nQuickened as promotion had been by the extensive active service, and\r\nproportionate number of casualties in the Regiment, between 1775 and\r\n1782, it was still unsatisfactory; and with a future of peace, it was\r\ncertain to become more so. It was necessary to introduce some remedy,\r\nand, in doing so, the Board of Ordnance adopted wisely the principle\r\npursued in later times by the late Secretary of State for War, Mr.\r\nCardwell, and made an organic change in the proportions of the various\r\nranks, instead of accelerating promotion in a temporary, spasmodic way,\r\nby encouraging unnecessary, impolitic, and costly retirements. Mr.\r\nCardwell, in 1872, when shadowing forth his views on this subject to the\r\nHouse of Commons, was unconsciously maturing the scheme commenced by the\r\nOrdnance in 1782—commenced, but never completed—for the Temple of Janus\r\nwas not long shut after 1783; and war postponed for many years the\r\nnecessity of accelerating a promotion which had ceased to be stagnant.\r\nThe dullness which followed 1815 was relieved periodically by\r\naugmentations to the Regiment in the form of other battalions; but the\r\nrelief was only temporary, and a darker shadow than ever loomed on the\r\nRegimental horizon, when Mr. Cardwell took office. His remedy was\r\ncomplex; but included, in a marked manner, the idea, born in 1782, of\r\nreducing the number of officers in subordinate positions, and increasing\r\nthe proportion of field officers.\r\n\r\nBy a Royal Warrant, dated 31st October, 1782, His Majesty was pleased on\r\nthe recommendation of the Board of Ordnance to declare that \"the present\r\nestablishment of our Royal Regiment of Artillery is in respect to\r\npromotion extremely disadvantageous to the officers belonging thereto,\r\nand that the small number of field officers does not bear a due\r\nproportion to that of officers of inferior rank.\" With a view to \"giving\r\nencouragement suitable to the utility of the said corps, and to the\r\nmerits of the officers who compose it,\" His Majesty decided that on the\r\n30th of the following month the existing establishment should cease, and\r\nanother be substituted, of which the two prominent features were—as will\r\nbe seen by the annexed tables—a very considerable increase in the number\r\nof field officers, and the reduction of one second lieutenant in each\r\ncompany. It was also decided that the second lieutenants remaining over\r\nand above the number fixed for the new establishment should be borne as\r\nsupernumeraries until absorbed, and that stoppages should be made in the\r\nfollowing manner to meet the expenses of their pay, viz.:—\r\n\r\n                                                             £ _s._ _d._\r\n\r\n From each of the two junior Second Colonels, 4_s._          0    8    0\r\n\r\n From each of the two junior Second Lieutenant-Colonels,     0    4    0\r\n   2_s._\r\n\r\n From each of the two junior Second Majors, 5_s._            0   10    0\r\n\r\n From each of the six junior Captains, 4_s._                 1    4    0\r\n\r\n From each of the six junior Captain-Lieutenants, 1_s._      0    8    0\r\n   4_d._\r\n\r\n From each of the six junior First Lieutenants, 8_d._        0    4    0\r\n\r\n                                                            ——   ——   ——\r\n\r\n                                                            £2   18    0\r\n\r\n                                                            ——   ——   ——\r\n\r\nThe annual total of this stoppage—amounting to 1058_l._ 10_s._—was in\r\nthe first instance applied to the payment of the supernumerary second\r\nlieutenants, and any surplus that might remain was ordered to be divided\r\nannually on the 31st December (in proportion to their pay) among the\r\nseveral officers who were at the time contributing towards it; and it\r\nwas directed that as soon as the number of second lieutenants should be\r\nreduced to one per company, the stoppages should cease to be made.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the alteration in the proportion of officers in the\r\nvarious ranks is very distinctly shown by Colonel Miller in his\r\npamphlet. Previous to the change, the proportion of company to field\r\nofficers had been as 21 to 1; now it became as 8½ to 1.\r\n\r\nThe following tables show (1) the establishment and cost of the Regiment\r\nin 1782 prior to the introduction of the new system; and (2) the\r\nproposed establishment, which came into force on the 30th November,\r\n1782. The number of company officers—five per company—then fixed,\r\nremains, to this day, unchanged in the Horse and Field Artillery; but a\r\nsubaltern per company or battery in the Garrison Artillery was reduced\r\nby the late Secretary of State for War, thus further improving the\r\nproportions of the field and company officers:—\r\n\r\n           1782.—PRESENT ESTABLISHMENT OF THE ROYAL REGIMENT\r\n                             OF ARTILLERY.\r\n\r\n                        FIELD AND STAFF OFFICERS.\r\n\r\n                                         Pay per diem.

Peace of 1783 came a reduction in the Regiment from 5337 of all\r\nranks to 3302, with a saving to the country of the difference between\r\n148,488_l._ 1_s._ 8_d._, the cost of the old establishment, and\r\n110,570_l._ 13_s._ 4_d._, the cost of the new. But the reduction and the\r\nsaving were not effected at once. Every allowance was made for existing\r\nclaims and interests; and for the first year after the Peace of\r\nVersailles, a charge was allowed of 129,373_l._ 11_s._ Two schemes were\r\nsubmitted by the Board for carrying out the required reductions: one\r\nleft the number of non-commissioned officers untouched; the other\r\nreduced it by one-half and spared the privates, who now were to receive\r\nthe title of gunner universally, that of matross being abolished. The\r\nfirst scheme was approved, but only as a temporary measure, and many of\r\nthe details were left optional to the captains of companies. In the\r\nwords of the Royal warrant, \"If in any company the commanding officer\r\nand captain should choose to keep all the four sergeants, the four\r\ncorporals, the nine bombardiers, and the eighteen gunners, he will of\r\ncourse have but twenty-two matrosses to retain, and must discharge the\r\nremainder, as each company is to consist only of sixty men, whether non-\r\ncommissioned officers or privates (including three contingent men),\r\nbesides the two drummers, so that a company wishing to preserve its\r\npresent sergeants, corporals, bombardiers, and gunners, will be composed\r\nof as follows, viz.:—\r\n\r\n                   Sergeants.                       4\r\n                   Corporals.                       4\r\n                   Bombardiers.                     9\r\n                   Gunners.                        18\r\n                   Matrosses.                      22\r\n                   Contingent men.                  3\r\n                   Drummers.                        2\r\n                                                   ——\r\n                               Total.              62\r\n\r\n\"But a company choosing to discharge any of their present sergeants,\r\ncorporals, bombardiers, or gunners, will have so many more matrosses to\r\nkeep, and all future vacancies of sergeants, corporals, bombardiers, or\r\ngunners will be supplied by matrosses only, until the establishment is\r\nbrought to\r\n\r\n                   Sergeants.                       2\r\n                   Corporals.                       2\r\n                   Bombardiers.                     3\r\n                   Matrosses to be called Gunners. 50\r\n                   Contingent men.                  3\r\n                   Drummers.                        2\r\n                                                   ——\r\n                               Total.              62\r\n\r\n\"It is further intended that fifteen men of each company should be\r\nartificers in the following proportion, viz.:—\r\n\r\n                   Carpenters.                      4\r\n                   Smiths.                          5\r\n                   Collar-maker.                    1\r\n                   Wheelers.                        4\r\n                   Tailor.                          1\r\n                                                   ——\r\n                               Total.              15\r\n\r\n\"The captains are therefore to endeavour to preserve in each company as\r\nmany men of those trades as will make up the number required; and should\r\nthere be in any of the companies more of one trade than the complement,\r\nthey will be set down as men to be transferred to some other company\r\nthat may be in want of them. These fifteen artificers, with ten\r\nlabourers from each company, are to be employed as such at Woolwich, and\r\nat the different outposts or garrisons where they may be stationed, and\r\nwill receive the following extra pay, viz.:—\r\n\r\n               Smiths.       One at 2_s._ per diem.\r\n                             Two at 1_s._ 3_d._ per diem.\r\n                             Two at 1_s._ per diem.\r\n\r\n               Wheelers.     One at 2_s._ per diem.\r\n                             Two at 1_s._ 3_d._ per diem.\r\n                             One at 1_s._ per diem.\r\n\r\n               Carpenters.   One at 2_s._ 6_d._ per diem.\r\n                             Two at 1_s._ 3_d._ per diem.\r\n                             One at 1_s._ per diem.\r\n\r\n               Collar-maker. One at 1_s._ 3_d._ per diem.\r\n\r\n               Tailor.       One at 1_s._ 3_d._ per diem.\r\n\r\nand the labourers at 9_d._, for so many days as they work, which will be\r\nfour in each week, the other two days being reserved for their being\r\ntrained as Artillerymen. The other twenty-five men per company are to do\r\nall the duty of the Regiment.\r\n\r\n\"Such men as are entitled to go to the Invalids are to receive the\r\npension, and whom the officers may wish to have discharged will, of\r\ncourse, receive that provision.\r\n\r\n\"If any of the sergeants, corporals, bombardiers, or gunners, who from\r\ntheir services are not entitled to the Invalids or pension, should wish\r\nto be discharged, and can take care of themselves, they should be parted\r\nwith in preference to matrosses, as the difference of their pay will be\r\na saving to Government, and the establishment will approach so much the\r\nnearer to what it is intended to be. It is not, however, meant that men\r\nunder this description, whom the officers may wish to keep should be\r\ndischarged, but only such as they can spare without prejudice to their\r\ncompanies....\r\n\r\n                                          (Signed)           \"RICHMOND.\"\r\n\r\nAll honour to the Duke of Richmond! No Master-General ever penned a more\r\nconsiderate and kindly Warrant, and none ever more fully realized the\r\nspeciality of the Artillery service. \"Without prejudice to their\r\ncompanies:\" here is the true Artillery unit officially recognized. No\r\nword of battalions: these were mere paper organizations, devoid of all\r\ntactical meaning. History in the end always preaches truth; and at the\r\nclose of a seven years' season of very earnest war, the uppermost\r\nthought in the mind of his Grace—the Colonel _ex officio_ of the Royal\r\nArtillery—was the welfare of _the companies_.\r\n\r\nThe pruning-knife had to be used, for the taxpayers of England were yet\r\nstaggering and reeling under the burden of wide-spread and continuous\r\nhostilities; but it was to be used with all tenderness for the\r\nsusceptibilities of the true Artillery unit, and of the captains through\r\nwhom the needs of that unit found expression.\r\n\r\nThe reductions having been decided upon, the following was the first\r\ndistribution of the Regiment after the Peace of Versailles:—\r\n\r\nFIRST BATTALION.—Six companies were ordered to Gibraltar to relieve the\r\nfive belonging to the Second Battalion, which had been stationed there\r\nduring the Siege. Four companies went to the West Indies, and one was\r\nreduced.\r\n\r\nSECOND BATTALION.—The whole ten companies of this battalion were ordered\r\nto Woolwich.\r\n\r\nTHIRD BATTALION.—The companies were directed to be stationed as follows:\r\nfive at Woolwich; one at the Tower; two at Portsmouth; one at Plymouth;\r\nand one at Chatham.\r\n\r\nFOURTH BATTALION.—Three companies of this battalion were stationed in\r\nJamaica, four in Canada, two at Halifax, Nova Scotia, and one in\r\nNewfoundland.\r\n\r\nBesides various small detachments in Great Britain, the Invalid\r\nBattalion had to find the Artillery part of the garrisons of Jersey,\r\nGuernsey, Newcastle, and Scotland. It will be observed that Ireland is\r\nnot mentioned, that country being garrisoned by the Royal Irish\r\nArtillery, which still enjoyed a separate existence.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn a November night in 1783, a large gathering of Artillery officers\r\ntook place at the 'Bull' Inn, on Shooter's Hill, to welcome Colonel\r\nWilliams and the officers who had served during the Great Siege of\r\nGibraltar, on their return to England. Among those present were officers\r\nwho had served in the Regiment during the Seven Years' War, in the\r\nAmerican War of Independence, in the East and West Indies, and in\r\nMinorca, besides those guests whose deeds had attracted such universal\r\nadmiration. This convivial meeting seems a fit standpoint from which to\r\nlook back on the years of the Regiment's life and growth between 1716\r\nand 1783. From the two companies with which it commenced, it had now\r\nattained forty _service_, and ten _invalid_ companies; and instead of\r\npleading—as was done in its infancy—inability to find men for the\r\nforeign establishments, it was able now to furnish Artillery for Canada,\r\nGibraltar, and the West Indies, to the extent of twenty companies,\r\nbesides finding drafts for the service of the East India Company, one of\r\nwhich had left only a few nights before this gathering to welcome the\r\nGibraltar heroes.\r\n\r\nAlready the motto—not to be given until 1832—had been earned; already\r\n_Ubique_ represented the services of the corps; already _Quo fas et\r\ngloria ducunt_ represented the aspirations of its members.\r\n\r\nMuch jealousy had been displayed by the other arms of the service; but\r\nit merely served to consolidate the scattered Regiment, and to awaken as\r\ndecided a Regimental _esprit_, as existed in smaller and less\r\ndistributed corps. The decisions on points of difference had almost\r\ninvariably been in favour of the Royal Artillery: in 1756 the Artillery\r\nwere directed to take the right of other troops on parade; and every\r\nargument as to the status of the officers was answered in their favour\r\nup to 1751, when all doubt on the subject was removed, and all\r\ndiscussion ceased, by the King instead of the Master-General signing\r\ntheir commissions.\r\n\r\nOn every occasion when the services of the corps were required, the zeal\r\nand ability of officers and men were readily acknowledged; and their\r\nconscientiousness in duty was as conspicuous as their knowledge of their\r\nprofession. And with this sense of duty and professional skill, came\r\nthat loveable feeling so well described in the words quoted in the\r\nintroductory chapter of this volume. \"It has ever been our pride, as a\r\ncorps, to be regarded as one family; and if one member of it, in any\r\nremote part of the world, in any way distinguished himself, it was felt\r\nuniversally that he had reflected credit and honour on the whole corps.\"\r\nIn this gathering among the woods on Shooter's Hill, on that November\r\nnight, this Regimental feeling found expression.[51]\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMany of the readers of this volume are doubtless familiar with the\r\nbeautiful interior of the new Garrison Church at Woolwich, the Walhalla\r\nof the Royal Artillery. Over the communion table, memorial windows have\r\nbeen placed by the officers of the Regiment, \"To the glory of God, and\r\nin commemoration of the services of their Corps during the great wars\r\nwith France and Russia.\" As autumn deepens into winter, and the twilight\r\ncomes down during the evening service, many must have noticed how with\r\nthe dying light all the figures in the painted windows sink away in\r\nshadow and darkness, with the exception of the centre figure, whose pale\r\nform—ghastly pale as Rubens' Dead Christ in Antwerp Cathedral—seems to\r\nstart out from the darkness, and become more distinct as the others fade\r\naway.\r\n\r\nIs the simile far-fetched—it certainly is not irreverent—to say that, as\r\nout of the gathering chancel-gloom He, the great emblem of affection and\r\nduty, seems to come and linger among his worshippers, so out of the\r\ntwilight of the receding years there seems to stand amid all the dimness\r\nand uncertainty of details—the confusion of figures—the forgetfulness of\r\neven great facts, a grand eloquent figure of Duty, learnt in stern\r\nwarfare, impressed in no idle peace, and loved in exact proportion as\r\nthe heart became inspired by increasing _esprit_, and enlarged by\r\nunselfish pride?\r\n\r\nDuty needs not love, nor encouragement, to make it noble; but a warm\r\nblush comes into the marble cheek, and a quickened pulse to the strong\r\nheart, when affection and duty go hand in hand, and the two great\r\nlessons of the God-man—love and obedience—blend unconsciously into one.\r\n\r\nDuring the sixty-seven years of the Regiment's existence, at the date\r\nwhen this chapter concludes, this blending had gradually and surely been\r\neffected; the fierce and selfish spirit of the pre-regimental trains had\r\ndisappeared, and an unselfish ambition had taken its place.\r\n\r\nWho shall say that in the sympathy of numbers there is not a power\r\nincalculable? And who can say that in its highest sense this sympathy\r\ncan be attained without either a common object, a common charge, or a\r\ncommon danger? If the Regimental system failed in all else in military\r\nlife, it succeeds in answering these three requisites. A common object—\r\nthe attainment of a glory which can be common and yet personal; a common\r\ncharge—the great legacy of former glory, which a man would be a craven\r\nif he let the breath of scorn approach; and a common danger, which on\r\nservice shall knit every man to his neighbour, and in after times shall\r\nbind them together again by sympathies and memory.\r\n\r\nAt times, indeed, the gloom may be great; the twilight may deepen with\r\nunnatural and unexpected rapidity; but even among beaten, and dying, and\r\ndarkening figures, _one_ must ever stand out in a Corps which has learnt\r\ntrue discipline—a figure which twilight cannot shroud, and which even\r\ndisaster itself at times may illumine, which not even monotonous\r\nroutine, nor seemingly valueless tasks can dim—the eternal and divine\r\nfigure of Duty.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 38:\r\n\r\n  Canon Kingsley, at the R.A.

The entrance subscription was fixed at\r\n  1_l._ 1_s._ Hitherto the officers had messed in two public-houses in\r\n  Woolwich, known jocularly as the \"Bastion,\" and \"Redan.\" The new mess-\r\n  room—afterwards a chapel—was where the Recreation Rooms now are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXX.\r\n        HISTORY, SUCCESSION OF CAPTAINS, AND PRESENT DESIGNATION\r\n           OF THE TROOPS AND COMPANIES BELONGING TO THE ROYAL\r\n       HORSE ARTILLERY, THE FIFTH, SIXTH, AND SEVENTH BATTALIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nALTHOUGH the Royal Horse Artillery, and the Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh\r\nBattalions were formed subsequently to the Peace of 1783, it has been\r\nconsidered desirable to insert a summary of the services of the troops\r\nand companies in this volume, without prejudice to a more detailed\r\nstatement which will be given in the succeeding volume, when their\r\nformation will be notified in due chronological order. The Seventh\r\nBattalion brings the reader to the commencement of the present century,\r\nlater than which time it has not been deemed necessary, in this volume,\r\nto go.\r\n\r\nCommencing with the Royal Horse Artillery, it may be mentioned, shortly,\r\nthat it was formed on the 1st January, 1793, and at first consisted of\r\ntwo Troops, A and B. On the 1st November in the same year C and D Troops\r\nwere added, followed, on the 1st November, 1794, by E and F Troops. In\r\nSeptember 1801, G Troop was formed, in Ireland, out of some detachments\r\nserving in that country; and in June, 1804, H Troop was raised at\r\nWoolwich. On 1st February, 1805, I Troop was formed at Colchester, and K\r\nTroop at Ballinasloe; L Troop at Woolwich in July of the same year, and\r\nM Troop also in 1805, although there is a little uncertainty as to the\r\nmonth. There were also two Rocket Troops, but there is considerable\r\ndifficulty in tracing their exact history. According to the records of\r\nthe Royal Horse Artillery, the Second Rocket Troop was formed before the\r\nFirst; but in this particular, as in another presently to be mentioned,\r\nthese records are inaccurate. The following would appear to be the true\r\nstatement of the case. In June 1813, some Rocket detachments, under\r\nCaptain R. Bogue, were ordered to Germany, and were present at the\r\nBattle of Leipsic. In 1814 a Rocket Troop was formed at Woolwich, under\r\nthe command of Captain W. G. Elliot; and _on the same day_ Captain E. C.\r\nWhinyates was appointed to the command of the Second Rocket Troop _vice_\r\nBogue, _killed at Leipsic_. Now, the Battle of Leipsic was fought in\r\nOctober—1813, and Captain Whinyates' appointment was dated the 2nd March\r\n1814. It would appear, therefore, that the two Rocket Troops were formed\r\n_together_, out of _existing detachments_, and that the one formed at\r\nWoolwich was named the First, while that formed out of the detachments\r\non the Continent was called the Second. Although the detachments present\r\nat Leipsic became the Second Rocket Troop, they were present at that\r\nbattle not as a troop, but as detachments; and as the troop was reduced\r\non 31st July 1816, their Leipsic services, by some mistake, were\r\nafterwards credited to the First Rocket Troop, which would actually\r\nappear to have received permission to wear \"Leipsic\" on its appointments\r\nin commemoration of the services, not of itself, but of the defunct\r\ntroop.\r\n\r\nIn 1847 rocket carriages were given to all the troops, and the remaining\r\nRocket Troop became I Troop of the Royal Horse Artillery.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Second Rocket Troop, D Troop also was reduced in\r\n1816; and, in spite of strong remonstrances,—among others, from the late\r\nSir Robert Gardiner, then Captain of E Troop,—the titles of all the\r\ntroops below D were changed, E, F, G, H, and I becoming respectively D,\r\nE, F, G, and H. The injury and inconvenience caused by this alteration\r\nof nomenclature have proved very great. K, L and M Troops were reduced\r\nat the same time, but being the juniors, their reduction did not affect\r\nthe lettering of the others.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1819, B and G Troops were reduced; but on this occasion no\r\nalteration was made in the designations of the other troops. B Troop was\r\nreformed on the 1st 1855, as a reserve half-troop, under a Second\r\nCaptain, and was augmented to a full troop in the following year. G\r\nTroop was reformed at Woolwich on the 1st December, 1857, and also K\r\nTroop on the same day.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st July, 1859, with the introduction of the Brigade System, came\r\nan alteration in the titles of the troops, which were now designated as\r\nBatteries of the Horse Brigade. In 1862, on account of the amalgamation\r\nwith the East India Company's Artillery, the old Royal Horse Artillery\r\nbecame the First Horse Brigade of the Royal Artillery; and in 1864, to\r\nenable the Indian reliefs to be carried on without sending the whole of\r\nthe old Horse Artillery abroad at one time, the First Horse Brigade was\r\ndivided into A and B Brigades of the Royal Horse Artillery.\r\n\r\nAt the date of this work (1872) the following list shows the present\r\ndesignations of the old troops, as they stood in 1859:—\r\n\r\n               A Troop is now called A Battery A Brigade\r\n               B Troop is now called B Battery A Brigade\r\n               C Troop is now called C Battery A Brigade\r\n               D Troop is now called A Battery B Brigade\r\n               E Troop is now called B Battery B Brigade\r\n               F Troop is now called C Battery B Brigade\r\n               G Troop is now called D Battery A Brigade\r\n               H Troop is now called D Battery B Brigade\r\n               I Troop is now called E Battery B Brigade\r\n               K Troop is now called E Battery A Brigade\r\n\r\nThe military operations in which these batteries have been severally\r\nengaged, and their succession of Captains, will now be given. The more\r\ndetailed history given of A Troop—\"The Chestnut Troop\"—is attributable\r\nto the labour taken by its Captain, the late Sir Hew Ross, who completed\r\nthe records of its active service with his own hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            A TROOP, R.H.A.,\r\n                      Now \"A\" BATTERY, A BRIGADE.\r\n\r\n ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n Battles, Sieges, and other Military operations in which this Company\r\n   has been engaged.\r\n ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n 1798       The affairs of Ross, Wexford, and Vinegar Hill, June.\r\n 1799       Egmont-op-Zee on 19th September.\r\n 1799       Near Alkmaar on 6th October.\r\n 1809       Retreat from Talavera on 3rd August.\r\n 1810       Action in front of Almeida in the Duas Casas on 20th July.\r\n 1810       Action on the Coa on 24th July.\r\n 1810       Battle of Busaco on 27th September.\r\n 1811       Action at Pombal on 11th March.\r\n 1811       Action on the Plain in front of Redinha on 12th March.\r\n 1811       Action in front of Cazal Nova on 13th March.\r\n 1811       Action at Foz d'Arouce on the Ceira on 15th March.\r\n 1811       Action at Sabugal on the Coa on 3rd April.\r\n 1811       Battle of Fuentes d'Onore on 5th May.\r\n 1811       Action in front of Mortagoa on the right bank of the Agueda\r\n              on 10th July.\r\n 1812       Siege of Ciudad Rodrigo, January.\r\n 1812       Siege of Badajoz, April.\r\n 1812       Affair in front of Salamanca on 16th June.\r\n 1812       Action at Castrejou on the Guavena on 18th July.\r\n 1812       Battle of Salamanca on 21st July.\r\n 1812       Action on the Huebra on 15th November.\r\n 1813       Affair in front of Salamanca in the advance on Vittoria on\r\n              22nd May.\r\n 1813       Affair near Burgos in the advance on Vittoria on 12th June.\r\n 1813       Affair at St. Millan and Osmo on 18th June.\r\n 1813       Battle of Vittoria on 21st June.\r\n 1813       Daily affairs with the French between 22nd and 27th June.\r\n 1813       Action before Pampeluna at daybreak when the French lost the\r\n              only two guns they brought from Vittoria, on 25th June.\r\n 1813       Actions in the Pyrenees on 26th, 27th and 28th July.\r\n 1813       Heights of San Marcial near Yrun on 31st August.\r\n 1813       Attack on La Rhune Mountain and its chain of heights in the\r\n              Pyrenees on 10th November.\r\n 1813       Passage of the Nivelle on 10th November.\r\n 1813       Passage of the Nive on 9th December.\r\n 1813       Battle of St. Pierre de Grube, near Bayonne.\r\n 1814       Passage of the Gave d'Oléron.\r\n 1814       Battle of Orthes on 27th February.\r\n 1814       Action in front of La Reole on the right of the Gavonne on\r\n              14th March.\r\n 1814       Affairs in front of La Reole, almost daily, between 14th\r\n              March and 14th April.[52]\r\n 1815       Battle of Waterloo, June 17th and 18th, and capture of\r\n              Paris.\r\n 1855       Siege of Sebastopol.\r\n\r\n ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n List of Captains who have successively commanded the Company, as far\r\n   back as can be traced, down to introduction of Brigade System, in\r\n   1859.\r\n ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n 1793       Captain R.

The companies were formed,—two at Plymouth and three at\r\nWoolwich,—by transfers from other battalions. Major-General Duncan\r\nDrummond was appointed Colonel _en seconde_; the first Lieutenant-\r\nColonel was Edward Williams; and the Major, Robert Douglas. Captains\r\nRogers and Miller commanded the companies formed at Plymouth, and\r\nCaptains Hutton, Harding, and Sproule, those at Woolwich. The following\r\nwas the strength of the five companies:—\r\n\r\n               10 Captains and Captain-Lieutenants.\r\n               12 Lieutenants, 15 being the normal number.\r\n                2 Staff Sergeants.\r\n               20 Sergeants.\r\n               45 Corporals and Bombardiers.\r\n                5 Drummers.\r\n              324 Gunners.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th March, 1795, five additional companies were added to the\r\nbattalion; and the total number of companies remained ten until the year\r\n1819, when Nos. 7 and 8 were reduced; Nos. 9 and 10 becoming\r\nrespectively Nos. 7 and 8.\r\n\r\nNo very great augmentation to the strength of the battalion took place\r\nduring the earlier years of its existence, except in the year 1804, when\r\na second Colonel was added, and also twenty men per company. The\r\nservices of the companies were very varied and distinguished, including\r\nthe Campaigns in Egypt, Cape of Good Hope, South America, Spain, and\r\nHolland.\r\n\r\nAnnexed is the history of each Company's active service, and the\r\nsuccession of Captains up to the introduction of the Brigade System:—\r\n\r\n\r\n                     No. 1 COMPANY, 5th BATTALION,\r\n                     Now \"F\" BATTERY, 1st BRIGADE.\r\n\r\n ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n Battles, Sieges, and other Military operations in which this Company\r\n   has been engaged.\r\n ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n 1814       Castine, North America.\r\n 1854       Expedition to the Crimea, and Fall of Sebastopol.\r\n\r\n ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n List of Captains who have successively commanded the Company, as far\r\n   back as can be traced, down to introduction of Brigade System, in\r\n   1859.\r\n ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n 1794       Captain Henry Rogers.\r\n 1802       Captain Charles Gold.\r\n 1803       Captain Henry Phillott.\r\n 1814       Captain Hon.

The addition of a Colonel _en\r\nseconde_ and two Lieutenant-Colonels completed the organization of what\r\nwas now known as the Sixth Battalion of the Royal Artillery. The Staff\r\nof the Battalion on its formation stood as follows:—\r\n\r\n Colonel-Commandant   Major-General P. Martin.\r\n Colonel _en seconde_ George Feade.\r\n 1st Lieut.-Colonel   Edward Fage.\r\n 2nd Lieut.-Colonels  John Barnes,\r\n                      Bayley Willington.\r\n Captain-Lieutenants  Ralph W. Adye, Adjutant.\r\n                      Andrew Schalch, Quartermaster.\r\n\r\nThe companies, their stations, and commanding officers were as follows:—\r\n\r\n  Companies.               Captains.                   Stations.\r\n      No. 1. Brevet-Major E. Lemoine               Cape of Good Hope.\r\n          2. Captain W. Skyring                    Cape of Good Hope.\r\n          3. R. Evans                              Woolwich.\r\n          4. D. Meredith                           Woolwich.\r\n          5. W. Millar                             Woolwich.\r\n          6. B. Bloomfield                         Plymouth.\r\n          7. G. Salmon                             Woolwich.\r\n          8. A. Schalch (promoted by augmentation) Woolwich.\r\n\r\nAn augmentation of one Major and two companies to the battalion,—Nos. 9\r\nand 10,—took place in December, 1800.\r\n\r\nThe companies called above \"The East India Detachment,\" which formed the\r\nnucleus of the Sixth Battalion, embarked at Woolwich for India on the\r\n19th April, 1791. They left that country for the Cape of Good Hope in\r\n1798, arriving in October of that year, and remained until incorporated\r\nin the newly-formed battalion, in 1799. They are now C Battery 11th\r\nBrigade, and No. 6 Battery 5th Brigade. Prior to 1799, although part of\r\nthe Royal Regiment of Artillery, they belonged to no battalion.\r\n\r\nThe following was the strength of the battalion in various years:—\r\n\r\n                      Year. Strength of all Ranks.\r\n                       1800                    990\r\n                       1801                   1071\r\n                       1802                    914\r\n                       1803                   1215\r\n                       1804                   1259\r\n                       1805                   1415\r\n                       1806                   1398\r\n                       1807                   1480\r\n                       1808                   1476\r\n                       1809                   1484\r\n                       1810                   1484\r\n                       1811                   1524\r\n                       1812                   1562\r\n                       1813                   1565\r\n                       1814                   1230\r\n                       1815                   1130\r\n                       1816                    870\r\n                       1817                    786\r\n                       1818                    700\r\n                       1819                    604\r\n                       1820                    567\r\n                       1821                    601\r\n\r\nFrom this date until 1847 the average strength of the battalion was 650.\r\n\r\n                      Year. Strength of all Ranks.\r\n                       1847                    956\r\n                       1848                    847\r\n                       1849                    890\r\n                       1850                    883\r\n                       1851                    940\r\n                       1852                   1028\r\n                       1853                   1081\r\n                       1854                   1218\r\n                       1855                   1375\r\n                       1856                   1317\r\n                       1857                   1502\r\n\r\nThe following was the dress of the battalion at its formation, in 1799,\r\nas also of the whole Regiment, except the Horse Artillery: the officers\r\nwore blue cloth double-breasted coats, with scarlet lappels; the field\r\nofficers had two epaulettes, the company officers only one, which they\r\nwore on the right shoulder; white kerseymere breeches; long black\r\nleather boots, fastened to the back part of the knee of the breeches by\r\na black strap and buckle; and a cocked-hat, with gold-loop and button,\r\nand white feather. The non-commissioned officers and men wore blue cloth\r\ncoats, single breasted, laced in front and on the cuffs and flaps; the\r\nstaff-sergeants and sergeants with gold lace, and the rank and file with\r\nyellow worsted lace. The staff-sergeants wore two gold bullion\r\nepaulettes; the sergeants two gold-laced straps; the corporals two\r\nfringe epaulettes; the bombardiers one fringe epaulette on the right\r\nshoulder; the gunners two worsted straps.\r\n\r\nThe changes in dress during the succeeding years will be noted in the\r\nsucceeding chapters of this work.\r\n\r\nAnnexed is the list, as in former cases, of the various companies, their\r\nsuccessive Captains, and the military operations in which they were\r\nengaged. In the Sixth Battalion, as in the Horse Artillery, considerable\r\nconfusion was created by the reduction, in 1819, of Nos. 5 and 8\r\ncompanies, and the consequent altering of the numbers of Nos. 6, 7, 9,\r\nand 10 to Nos. 5, 6, 7, and 8 respectively. The reduction of the two\r\njunior companies, instead of Nos. 5 and 8, would have rendered the\r\nstudent's task a far easier one.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      No. 1 COMPANY, 6th BATTALION\r\n          (_One of the old East India Detachment Companies_),\r\n                     Now \"C\" BATTERY, 11th BRIGADE.\r\n\r\n ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n Battles, Sieges, and other Military operations in which this Company\r\n   has been engaged.\r\n ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n 1806       Siege of Buenos Ayres.\r\n 1807       Expedition to La Plata.\r\n 1855       Expedition to the Crimea and Fall of Sebastopol.[60]\r\n\r\n ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n List of Captains who have successively commanded the Company, as far\r\n   back as can be traced, down to introduction of Brigade System, in\r\n   1859.\r\n ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n 1799       Captain Edmund Lemoine.\r\n 1804       Captain Nathaniel Foy.\r\n 1806       Captain C.

The Act for the Union between England and Ireland received\r\nthe Royal assent on the 2nd July, 1800, and came into force on the 1st\r\nJanuary, 1801. From this measure arose, as has been mentioned in a\r\nformer chapter, the incorporation of the Royal Irish Artillery with the\r\nolder Corps; and it was transferred as the Seventh Battalion of the\r\nRoyal Artillery, consisting, at the date of transfer, of ten companies,\r\nwith a proportion of Field and Staff officers. The incorporated officers\r\ntook rank according to the dates of their respective commissions; but\r\nthey were also allowed the option of retiring on full pay, or of taking\r\ncommissions in the Line. The non-commissioned officers and gunners who\r\nwere approved for transfer received each a bounty of three guineas.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the proportion of ranks, total numbers, and\r\nrates of daily pay, in the Battalion when first formed.\r\n\r\n                                                       Daily pay each.\r\n  One Colonel-Commandant                                      2  4   0\r\n  One Colonel                                                 1  4   0\r\n  Three Lieutenant-Colonels, each                             1  0   0\r\n  One Major                                                   0 15   0\r\n  Ten Captains, each                                          0 10   0\r\n  Ten Captain-Lieutenants, each                               0  7   0\r\n  Twenty First Lieutenants, each                              0  6   0\r\n  Ten Second Lieutenants, each                                0  5   0\r\n  One Adjutant                                                0  5   0\r\n  One Quartermaster                                           0  6   0\r\n  Forty Sergeants and two Staff Sergeants    Pay of various rates.\r\n  Forty Corporals, each                                       0  2  3¼\r\n  Seventy Bombardiers, each                                   0  1 10¼\r\n  980 Gunners, each                                           0  1  3¼\r\n  30 Drummers, each                                           0  1  3¼\r\n\r\nSome of the companies were in the West Indies when the transfer was\r\neffected; and on reference to the appended list it will be seen that\r\nmuch of the active service of the Seventh Battalion was carried on in\r\nthese islands. It was in connection with West Indian service that the\r\nBattalion obtained a distinctive mark, as containing among its companies\r\none known always, until the Brigade system was introduced, as\r\n\r\n\r\n                       \"THE BATTLE-AXE COMPANY.\"\r\n\r\nThe story of the circumstances under which this title was earned is\r\nworthy of reproduction. The company in question was originally No. 8 of\r\nthe 7th Battalion, but in the year 1819, No. 7 Company being reduced,\r\nNo. 8 became No. 7. Under the altered nomenclature of 1859, it became\r\nand now is\r\n\r\n\r\n                      NO. 2 BATTERY, 5TH BRIGADE.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1808 the company was quartered in Halifax, Nova Scotia. In\r\nDecember of that year it was ordered on an expedition for the capture of\r\nMartinique; forming part of the force under Sir George Prevost, which\r\nincluded the 7th Fusiliers, 8th King's, and 23rd Royal Welsh Fusiliers.\r\n\r\nThe force arrived at Martinique on the 30th January, 1809, and remained\r\nbrigaded together during the attack, quite distinct from the West Indian\r\ndivision under General Maitland, which had arrived in company with\r\nAdmiral Cochrane and his fleet. On the 2nd February, 1809, the French\r\nmet the Halifax brigade under General Prevost, about half-way between\r\nthe bay where they landed and the town, but were driven back with\r\nconsiderable loss. In one day, this company prepared and armed a battery\r\nof six 24-pounders, and four 10-inch mortars, and opened fire on the day\r\nfollowing. On the 24th February the Garrison capitulated, for \"the\r\nBritish Artillery was so well served, that most of the Fort guns were\r\nquickly dismounted.\"[62] The officers of the company were assembled by\r\nthe General to consult as to what should be bestowed on the company as a\r\nreward of bravery and good conduct. It was first contemplated to give a\r\none-pounder French gun, beautifully mounted, but the officers, knowing\r\nthat the company was about to return to Halifax, and a war with America\r\nlikely to take place, when they would be unable to take the gun with\r\nthem, chose an axe and a brass drum. A brass eagle was affixed to the\r\naxe, which was always carried by the tallest man in the company, who in\r\nvirtue of his office was permitted to wear a moustache.\r\n\r\nThis version of the story was committed to paper by one who was present\r\nwith the company at Martinique, Master-Gunner Henry McElsander, who\r\njoined it three years after the amalgamation, and remained in it until\r\npromoted to be Sergt.-Major at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. It\r\nis completely corroborated by the Records of the Seventh Battalion, from\r\nwhich the further history of the company may be obtained. It returned to\r\nHalifax in April, and remained in that station until May, 1813, when it\r\nsailed for Quebec. It served in the campaigns of 1813 and 1814 in\r\nCanada. In the winter of the former year it was collected in Kingston,\r\nUpper Canada, watching the enemy. Acting-Bombardier James Keating, being\r\ndetached with seven gunners to Michilimackinac, distinguished himself in\r\nan affair with the enemy, and his conduct was rewarded by a commission\r\nfrom the Provincial Government. The company was present at the\r\noperations against Fort Erie in August, 1814, and at the enemy's attack\r\non the English position before that place on the 17th September. It was\r\nalso engaged in the defence of the Log Bridge on the Chippawa. The two\r\nofficers present with the company during these hostilities, Captain\r\nWalker and Lieutenant Carter,[63] were specially mentioned in\r\ndespatches, and received permission to wear \"Niagara\" on their\r\nappointments. The company returned to Woolwich in 1823, and in 1831\r\nagain proceeded on foreign service to the West Indies, whence it\r\nreturned in 1837. Its only additional foreign service prior to the\r\nintroduction of the Brigade system was at Gibraltar, where it served\r\nfrom January, 1845 to January, 1851, and to which station it again\r\nproceeded in May, 1855.\r\n\r\nThe history, present designation, and succession of Captains, of all the\r\ncompanies, will now be given.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     No. 1 COMPANY, 7th BATTALION,\r\n                     Now \"C\" BATTERY, 1st BRIGADE.\r\n\r\n ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n Battles, Sieges, and other Military operations in which this Company\r\n   has been engaged.\r\n ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n 1803       Capture of the French, Danish, and Dutch possessions.\r\n 1809       Reduction of Fort Dasaix.\r\n 1809       Reduction of Martinique.\r\n 1810       Expedition to Guadaloupe.\r\n 1855       Expedition to the Crimea.\r\n\r\n ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n List of Captains who have successively commanded the Company, as far\r\n   back as can be traced, down to introduction of Brigade System, in\r\n   1859.\r\n ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n 1794       Captain George Lindsay.\r\n 1804       Captain Edmund Curry.\r\n 1804       Captain H.
