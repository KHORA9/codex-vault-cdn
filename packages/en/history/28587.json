BELL AND SONS, LTD\r\n  1911\r\n\r\n  [_Reprinted from Stereotype plates._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf Ammianus Marcellinus, the writer of the following History, we know\r\nvery little more than what can be collected from that portion of it\r\nwhich remains to us. From that source we learn that he was a native of\r\nAntioch, and a soldier; being one of the _prefectores domestici_--the\r\nbody-guard of the emperor, into which none but men of noble birth were\r\nadmitted. He was on the staff of Ursicinus, whom he attended in several\r\nof his expeditions; and he bore a share in the campaigns which Julian\r\nmade against the Persians. After that time he never mentions himself,\r\nand we are ignorant when he quitted the service and retired to Rome, in\r\nwhich city he composed his History. We know not when he was born, or\r\nwhen he died, except that from one or two incidental passages in his\r\nwork it is plain that he lived nearly to the end of the fourth century:\r\nand it is even uncertain whether he was a Christian or a Pagan; though\r\nthe general belief is, that he adhered to the religion of the ancient\r\nRomans, without, however, permitting it to lead him even to speak\r\ndisrespectfully of Christians or Christianity.\r\n\r\nHis History, which he divided into thirty-one books (of which the first\r\nthirteen are lost, while the text of those which remain is in some\r\nplaces imperfect), began with the accession of Nerva, A.D. 96, where\r\nTacitus and Suetonius end, and was continued to the death of Valens,\r\nA.D. 378, a period of 282 years. And there is probably no work as to the\r\nintrinsic value of which there is so little difference of opinion.\r\nGibbon bears repeated testimony to his accuracy, fidelity, and\r\nimpartiality, and quotes him extensively. In losing his aid after A.D.\r\n378, he says, \"It is not without sincere regret that I must now take\r\nleave of an accurate and faithful guide, who has composed the history of\r\nhis own times without indulging the prejudices and passions which\r\nusually affect the mind of a contemporary.\" Professor Ramsay (in Smith's\r\nDictionary of Greek and Roman Biography) says, \"We are indebted to him\r\nfor a knowledge of many important facts not elsewhere recorded, and for\r\nmuch valuable insight into the modes of thought and the general tone of\r\npublic feeling prevalent in his day. Nearly all the statements admitted\r\nappear to be founded upon his own observations, or upon the information\r\nderived from trustworthy eye-witnesses. A considerable number of\r\ndissertations and digressions are introduced, many of them highly\r\ninteresting and valuable. Such are his notices of the institutions and\r\nmanners of the Saracens (xiv. 4), of the Scythians and Sarmatians (xvii.\r\n12), of the Huns and Alani (xxxi. 2), of the Egyptians and their country\r\n(xxii. 6, 14-16), and his geographical discussions upon Gaul (xv. 9),\r\nthe Pontus (xxii. 8), and Thrace (xxvii. 4). Less legitimate and less\r\njudicious are his geological speculations upon earthquakes (xvii. 7),\r\nhis astronomical inquiries into eclipses (xx. 3), comets (xxv. 10), and\r\nthe regulation of the calendar (xxvi. 1); his medical researches into\r\nthe origin of epidemics (xix. 4); his zoological theory on the\r\ndestruction of lions by mosquitos (xviii. 7), and his horticultural\r\nessay on the impregnation of palms (xxiv. 3). In addition to industry in\r\nresearch and honesty of purpose, he was gifted with a large measure of\r\nstrong common sense, which enabled him in many points to rise superior\r\nto the prejudices of his day, and with a clear-sighted independence of\r\nspirit which prevented him from being dazzled or over-awed by the\r\nbrilliancy and the terrors which enveloped the imperial throne. But\r\nalthough sufficiently acute in detecting and exposing the follies of\r\nothers, and especially in ridiculing the absurdities of popular\r\nsuperstition, Ammianus did not entirely escape the contagion. The\r\ngeneral and deep-seated belief in magic spells, omens, prodigies, and\r\noracles, which appears to have gained additional strength upon the first\r\nintroduction of Christianity, evidently exercised no small influence\r\nover his mind. The old legends and doctrines of the pagan creed, and the\r\nsubtle mysticism which philosophers pretended to discover lurking below,\r\nwhen mixed up with the pure and simple but startling tenets of the new\r\nfaith, formed a confused mass which few intellects could reduce to order\r\nand harmony.\"\r\n\r\nThe vices of our author's style, and his ambitious affectation of\r\nornament, are condemned by most critics; but some of the points which\r\nstrike a modern reader as defects evidently arise from the alteration\r\nwhich the Latin language had already undergone since the days of Livy.\r\nHis great value, however, consists in the facts he has made known to us,\r\nand is quite independent of the style or language in which he has\r\nconveyed that knowledge, of which without him we should have been nearly\r\ndestitute.\r\n\r\nThe present translation has been made from Wagner and Erfurdt's edition,\r\npublished at Leipzig in 1808, and their division of chapters into short\r\nparagraphs has been followed.\r\n\r\n_Feb._ 1862.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORY OF AMMIANUS MARCELLINUS.\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST THIRTEEN BOOKS ARE LOST.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK XIV.\r\n\r\nARGUMENT.\r\n\r\n     I.

After the events of an expedition full of almost insuperable\r\ndifficulties, while the spirits of all parties in the state, broken by\r\nthe variety of their dangers and toils, were still enfeebled; while the\r\nclang of trumpets was ringing in men's ears, and the troops were still\r\ndistributed in their winter quarters, the storms of angry fortune\r\nsurrounded the commonwealth with fresh dangers through the manifold and\r\nterrible atrocities of Cæsar Gallus:[1] who, when just entering into the\r\nprime of life, having been raised with unexpected honour from the\r\nlowest depth of misery to the highest rank, exceeded all the legitimate\r\nbounds of the power conferred on him, and with preposterous violence\r\nthrew everything into confusion. For by his near relationship to the\r\nroyal family, and his connection with the name of Constantine, he was so\r\ninflated with pride, that if he had had more power, he would, as it\r\nseemed, have ventured to attack even the author of his prosperity.\r\n\r\n2. His wife added fuel to his natural ferocity; she was a woman\r\nimmoderately proud of her sisterly relationship to Augustus, and had\r\nbeen formerly given in marriage by the elder Constantine to King\r\nHannibalianus,[2] his brother's son. She was an incarnate fury: never\r\nweary of inflaming his savage temper, thirsting for human blood as\r\ninsatiably as her husband. The pair, in process of time, becoming more\r\nskilful in the infliction of suffering, employed a gang of underhand and\r\ncrafty talebearers, accustomed in their wickedness to make random\r\nadditions to their discoveries, which consisted in general of such\r\nfalsehoods as they themselves delighted in; and these men loaded the\r\ninnocent with calumnies, charging them with aiming at kingly power, or\r\nwith practising infamous acts of magic.\r\n\r\n3. And among his less remarkable atrocities, when his power had gone\r\nbeyond the bounds of moderate crimes, was conspicuous the horrible and\r\nsudden death of a certain noble citizen of Alexandria, named Clematius.\r\nHis mother-in-law, having conceived a passion for him, could not prevail\r\non him to gratify it; and in consequence, as was reported, she, having\r\nobtained an introduction by a secret door into the palace, won over the\r\nqueen by the present of a costly necklace, and procured a fatal warrant\r\nto be sent to Honoratus, at that time count-governor of the East, in\r\ncompliance with which Clematius was put to death, a man wholly innocent\r\nof any kind of wickedness, without being permitted to say a word in his\r\ndefence.\r\n\r\n4. After this iniquitous transaction, which struck others also with fear\r\nlest they should meet with similar treatment, as if cruelty had now\r\nobtained a licence, many were condemned on mere vague suspicion; of whom\r\nsome were put to death, others were punished by the confiscation of\r\ntheir property, and driven forth as exiles from their homes, so that\r\nhaving nothing left but their tears and complaints, they were reduced to\r\nlive on the contributions of their friends; and many opulent and famous\r\nhouses were shut up, the old constitutional and just authority being\r\nchanged into a government at the will of a bloodthirsty tyrant.\r\n\r\n5. Nor amid these manifold atrocities was any testimony of an accuser,\r\nnot even of a suborned one, sought for, in order to give at least an\r\nappearance of these crimes being committed according to law and statute,\r\nas very commonly even the most cruel princes have done: but whatever\r\nsuited the implacable temper of Cæsar was instantly accomplished in\r\nhaste, as if its accordance with human and divine law had been well\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\n6. After these deeds a fresh device was adopted, and a body of obscure\r\nmen, such as, by reason of the meanness of their condition, were little\r\nlikely to excite suspicion, were sent through all the districts of\r\nAntioch, to collect reports, and to bring news of whatever they might\r\nhear. They, travelling about, and concealing their object, joined\r\nclandestinely in the conversational circles of honourable men, and also\r\nin disguise obtained entrance into the houses of the rich. When they\r\nreturned they were secretly admitted by back doors into the palace, and\r\nthen reported all that they had been able to hear or to collect; taking\r\ncare with an unanimous kind of conspiracy to invent many things, and to\r\nexaggerate for the worse all they really knew; at the same time\r\nsuppressing any praises of Cæsar which had come to their ears, although\r\nthese were wrung from many, against their consciences, by the dread of\r\nimpending evils.\r\n\r\n7. And it had happened sometimes that, if in his secret chamber, when no\r\ndomestic servant was by, the master of the house had whispered anything\r\ninto his wife's ear, the very next day, as if those renowned seers of\r\nold, Amphiaraus or Marcius, had been at hand to report it, the emperor\r\nwas informed of what had been said; so that even the walls of a man's\r\nsecret chamber, the only witnesses to his language, were viewed with\r\napprehension.\r\n\r\n8. And Cæsar's fixed resolution to inquire into these and other similar\r\noccurrences was increased by the queen, who constantly stimulated his\r\ndesire, and was driving on the fortunes of her husband to headlong\r\ndestruction, while she ought rather, by giving him useful advice, to\r\nhave led him back into the paths of truth and mercy, by feminine\r\ngentleness, as, in recounting the acts of the Gordiani, we have related\r\nto have been done by the wife of that truculent emperor Maximinus.\r\n\r\n9. At last, by an unsurpassed and most pernicious baseness, Gallus\r\nventured on adopting a course of fearful wickedness, which indeed\r\nGallienus, to his own exceeding infamy, is said formerly to have tried\r\nat Rome; and, taking with him a few followers secretly armed, he used to\r\nrove in the evening through the streets and among the shops, making\r\ninquiries in the Greek language, in which he was well skilled, what were\r\nthe feelings of individuals towards Cæsar. And he used to do this boldly\r\nin the city, where the brillancy of the lamps at night often equalled\r\nthe light of day. At last, being often recognized, and considering that\r\nif he went out in this way he should be known, he took care never to go\r\nout except openly in broad daylight, to transact whatever business which\r\nhe thought of serious importance. And these things caused bitter though\r\nsecret lamentation, and discontent to many.\r\n\r\n10. But at that time Thalassius was the present prefect[3] of the\r\npalace, a man of an arrogant temper; and he, perceiving that the hasty\r\nfury of Gallus gradually increased to the danger of many of the\r\ncitizens, did not mollify it by either delay or wise counsels, as men in\r\nhigh office have very often pacified the anger of their princes; but by\r\nuntimely opposition and reproof, did often excite him the more to\r\nfrenzy; often also informing Augustus of his actions, and that too with\r\nexaggeration, and taking care, I know not with what intention, that what\r\nhe did should not be unknown to the emperor. And at this Cæsar soon\r\nbecame more vehemently exasperated, and, as if raising more on high than\r\never the standard of his contumacy, without any regard to the safety of\r\nothers or of himself, he bore himself onwards like a rapid torrent, with\r\nan impetuosity which would listen to no reason, to sweep away all the\r\nobstacles which opposed his will.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. Nor indeed was the East the only quarter which this plague affected\r\nwith its various disasters. For the Isaurians also, a people who were\r\naccustomed to frequent alternations of peace, and of turbulence which\r\nthrew everything into confusion with sudden outbreaks--impunity having\r\nfostered their growing audacity and encouraged it to evil--broke out in\r\na formidable war. Being especially excited, as they gave out by this\r\nindignity, that some of their allies, having been taken prisoners, were\r\nin an unprecedented manner exposed to wild beasts, and in the games of\r\nthe amphitheatre, at Iconium, a town of Pisidia.\r\n\r\n2. And as Cicero[4] says, that \"even wild beasts, when reminded by\r\nhunger, generally return to that place where they have been fed before.\"\r\nSo they all, descending like a whirlwind from their high and pathless\r\nmountains, came into the districts bordering on the sea: in which hiding\r\nthemselves in roads full of lurking-places, and in defiles, when the\r\nlong nights were approaching, the moon being at that time new, and so\r\nnot yet giving her full light, they lay wait for the sailors; and when\r\nthey perceived that they were wrapped in sleep, they, crawling on their\r\nhands and feet along the cables which held the anchors, and raising\r\nthemselves up by them, swung themselves into the boats, and so came\r\nupon the crews unexpectedly, and, their natural ferocity being inflamed\r\nby covetousness, they spared not even those who offered no resistance,\r\nbut slew them all, and carried off a splendid booty with no more trouble\r\nthan if it had been valueless.\r\n\r\n3. This conduct did not last long, for when the deaths of the crews thus\r\nplundered and slaughtered became known, no one afterwards brought a\r\nvessel to the stations on that coast; but, avoiding them as they would\r\nhave avoided the deadly precipices of Sciron,[5] they sailed on, without\r\nhalting, to the shores of Cyprus, which lie opposite to the rocks of\r\nIsauria.\r\n\r\n4. Therefore as time went on, and no foreign vessels went there any\r\nmore, they quitted the sea-coast, and betook themselves to Lycaonia, a\r\ncountry which lies on the borders of Isauria. And there, occupying the\r\nroads with thick barricades, they sought a living by plundering the\r\ninhabitants of the district, as well as travellers. These outrages\r\naroused the soldiers who were dispersed among the many municipal towns\r\nand forts which lie on the borders. And they, endeavouring to the utmost\r\nof their strength to repel these banditti, who were spreading every day\r\nmore widely, sometimes in solid bodies, at others in small straggling\r\nparties, were overcome by their vast numbers.\r\n\r\n5. Since the Isaurians, having been born and brought up amid the\r\nentangled defiles of lofty mountains, could bound over them as over\r\nplain and easy paths, and attacked all who came in their way with\r\nmissiles from a distance, terrifying them at the same time with savage\r\nyells.\r\n\r\n6. And very often our infantry were compelled in pursuit of them to\r\nclimb lofty crags, and, when their feet slipped, to catch hold of the\r\nshrubs and briars to raise themselves to the summits; without ever being\r\nable to deploy into battle array, by reason of the narrow and difficult\r\nnature of the ground, nor even to stand firm; while their enemy running\r\nround in every direction hurled down upon them fragments of rock from\r\nabove till they retired down the declivities with great danger. Or\r\nelse, sometimes, in the last necessity fighting bravely, they were\r\noverwhelmed with fragments of immense bulk and weight.\r\n\r\n7. On this account they subsequently were forced to observe more\r\ncaution, and whenever the plunderers began to retire to the high ground,\r\nour soldiers yielded to the unfavourable character of the country and\r\nretired. But whenever they could be met with in the plain, which often\r\nhappened, then charging them without giving them time to combine their\r\nstrength, or even to brandish the javelins of which they always carried\r\ntwo or three, they slaughtered them like defenceless sheep.\r\n\r\n8. So that these banditti, conceiving a fear of Lycaonia, which is for\r\nthe most part a champaign country, since they had learnt by repeated\r\nproofs that they were unequal to our troops in a pitched battle, betook\r\nthemselves by unfrequented tracks to Pamphylia. This district had long\r\nbeen free from the evils of war, but nevertheless had been fortified in\r\nall quarters by strong forts and garrisons, from the dread entertained\r\nby the people of rapine and slaughter, since soldiers were scattered\r\nover all the neighbouring districts.\r\n\r\n9. Therefore hastening with all speed, in order by their exceeding\r\ncelerity of movement to anticipate all rumour of their motions, trusting\r\nto their strength and activity of body, they travelled by winding roads\r\nuntil they reached the high ground on the tops of the mountains, the\r\nsteepness of which delayed their march more than they had expected. And\r\nwhen at last, having surmounted all the difficulties of the mountains,\r\nthey came to the precipitous banks of the Melas, a deep river and one\r\nfull of dangerous currents, which winds round the district, protecting\r\nthe inhabitants like a wall, the night which had overtaken them\r\nincreased their fears, so that they halted for a while awaiting the\r\ndaylight. For they expected to be able to cross without hindrance, and\r\nthen, in consequence of the suddenness of their inroad, to be able to\r\nravage all the country around; but they had incurred great toil to no\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n10. For when the sun rose they were prevented from crossing by the size\r\nof the river, which though narrow was very deep. And while they were\r\nsearching for some fishing-boats, or preparing to commit themselves to\r\nthe stream on rafts hastily put together, the legions which at that\r\ntime were wintering about Side, came down upon them with great speed and\r\nimpetuosity; and having pitched their standards close to the bank with a\r\nview to an immediate battle, they packed their shields together before\r\nthem in a most skilful manner, and without any difficulty slew some of\r\nthe banditti, who either trusted to their swimming, or who tried to\r\ncross the river unperceived in barks made of the trunks of trees\r\nhollowed out.\r\n\r\n11. And the Isaurians having tried many devices to obtain success in a\r\nregular battle, and having failed in everything, being repulsed in great\r\nconsternation, and with great vigour on the part of the legions, and\r\nbeing uncertain which way to go, came near the town of Laranda. And\r\nthere, after they had refreshed themselves with food and rest, and\r\nrecovered from their fears, they attacked several wealthy towns; but\r\nbeing presently scared by the support given to the citizens by some\r\nsquadrons of horse which happened to be at hand, and which they would\r\nnot venture to resist in the extensive plains, they retreated, and\r\nretracing their steps summoned all the flower of their youth which had\r\nbeen left at home to join them.\r\n\r\n12. And as they were oppressed with severe famine, they made for a place\r\ncalled Palea, standing on the sea-shore, and fortified with a strong\r\nwall; where even to this day supplies are usually kept in store, to be\r\ndistributed to the armies which defend the frontier of Isauria.\r\n\r\n13. Therefore they encamped around this fortress for three days and\r\nthree nights, and as the steepness of the ground on which it stood\r\nprevented any attempt to storm it without the most deadly peril, and as\r\nit was impossible to effect anything by mines, and no other manoeuvres\r\nsuch as are employed in sieges availed anything, they retired much\r\ndejected, being compelled by the necessities of their situation to\r\nundertake some enterprise, even if it should be greater than their\r\nstrength was equal to.\r\n\r\n14. Then giving way to greater fury than ever, being inflamed both by\r\ndespair and hunger, and their strength increased by their unrestrainable\r\nardour, they directed their efforts to destroy the city of Seleucia, the\r\nmetropolis of the province, which was defended by Count Castucius, whose\r\nlegions were inured to every kind of military service.\r\n\r\n15. The commanders of the garrison being forewarned of their approach\r\nby their own trusty scouts, having, according to custom, given, out the\r\nwatchword to the troops, led forth all their forces in a rapid sally,\r\nand having with great activity passed the bridge over the river\r\nCalicadnus, the mighty waters of which wash the turrets of the walls,\r\nthey drew out their men as if prepared for battle. But as yet no man\r\nleft the ranks, and the army was not allowed to engage; for the band of\r\nthe Isaurians was dreaded, inasmuch as they were desperate with rage,\r\nand superior in number, and likely to rush upon the arms of the legions\r\nwithout any regard to their lives. Therefore as soon as the army was\r\nbeheld at a distance, and the music of the trumpeters was heard, the\r\nbanditti halted and stood still for a while, brandishing their\r\nthreatening swords, and after a time they marched on slowly. And when\r\nthe steady Roman soldiery began to deploy, preparing to encounter them,\r\nbeating their shields with their spears (a custom which rouses the fury\r\nof the combatants, and strikes terror into their enemies), they filled\r\nthe front ranks of the Isaurians with consternation. But as the troops\r\nwere pressing forward eagerly to the combat their generals recalled\r\nthem, thinking it inopportune to enter upon a contest of doubtful issue,\r\nwhen their walls were not far distant, under protection of which the\r\nsafety of the whole army could be placed on a solid foundation.\r\n\r\n16. Therefore the soldiers were brought back inside the walls in\r\naccordance with this resolution, and all the approaches and gates were\r\nstrongly barred; and the men were placed on the battlements and\r\nbulwarks, having vast stones and weapons of all kinds piled close at\r\nhand, so that if any one forced his way inside he might be overwhelmed\r\nwith a multitude of missiles and stones.\r\n\r\n17. But those who were shut up in the walls were at the same time\r\ngreatly afflicted, because the Isaurians having taken some vessels which\r\nwere conveying grain down the river, were well provided with abundance\r\nof food, while they themselves, having almost consumed the usual stores\r\nof food, were in a state of alarm dreading the fatal agonies of\r\napproaching famine. When the news of this distress got abroad, and when\r\nrepeated messages to this effect had moved Gallus Cæsar, because the\r\nmaster of the horse was kept away longer than usual at that season,\r\nNebridius the count of the East was ordered to collect a military force\r\nfrom all quarters, and hastened forward with exceeding zeal to deliver\r\nthe city, so wealthy and important, from such a peril. And when this was\r\nknown the banditti retired, without having performed any memorable\r\nexploit, and dispersing, according to their wont, they sought the\r\ntrackless recesses of the lofty mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. While affairs were in this state in Isauria, and while the king of\r\nPersia was involved in wars upon his frontier, repulsing from his\r\nborders a set of ferocious tribes which, being full of fickleness, were\r\ncontinually either attacking him in a hostile manner, or, as often\r\nhappens, aiding him when he turned his arms against us, a certain noble,\r\nby name Nohodares, having been appointed to invade Mesopotamia, whenever\r\noccasion might serve, was anxiously exploring our territories with a\r\nview to some sudden incursion, if he could anywhere find an opportunity.\r\n\r\n2. And because since every part of Mesopotamia is accustomed to be\r\ndisturbed continually, the lands were protected by frequent barriers,\r\nand military stations in the rural districts, Nohodares, having directed\r\nhis march to the left, had occupied the most remote parts of the\r\nOsdroene, having devised a novel plan of operations which had never\r\nhitherto been tried. And if he had succeeded he would have laid waste\r\nthe whole country like a thunderbolt.\r\n\r\n3. Now the plan which he had conceived was of this kind. There is a town\r\nin Anthemusia called Batne, built by the ancient Macedonians, a short\r\ndistance from the river Euphrates, thickly peopled by wealthy merchants.\r\nTo this city, about the beginning of the month of September, a great\r\nmultitude of all ranks throng to a fair, in order to buy the wares which\r\nthe Indians and Chinese send thither, and many other articles which are\r\nusually brought to this fair by land and sea.\r\n\r\n4. The leader before named, preparing to invade this district on the\r\ndays set apart for this solemnity, marching through the deserts and\r\nalong the grassy banks of the river Abora, was betrayed by information\r\ngiven by some of his own men, who being alarmed at the discovery of\r\ncertain crimes which they had committed, deserted to the Roman\r\ngarrisons, and accordingly he retired again without having accomplished\r\nanything; and after that remained quiet without undertaking any further\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n§ 1. At this time also the Saracens, a race whom it is never desirable\r\nto have either for friends or enemies, ranging up and down the country,\r\nif ever they found anything, plundered it in a moment, like rapacious\r\nhawks who, if from on high they behold any prey, carry it off with rapid\r\nswoop, or, if they fail in their attempt, do not tarry.\r\n\r\n2. And although, in recounting the career of the Prince Marcus, and once\r\nor twice subsequently, I remember having discussed the manners of this\r\npeople, nevertheless I will now briefly enumerate a few more particulars\r\nconcerning them.\r\n\r\n3. Among these tribes, whose primary origin is derived from the\r\ncataracts of the Nile and the borders of the Blemmyæ, all the men are\r\nwarriors of equal rank; half naked, clad in coloured cloaks down to the\r\nwaist, overrunning different countries, with the aid of swift and active\r\nhorses and speedy camels, alike in times of peace and war. Nor does any\r\nmember of their tribes ever take plough in hand or cultivate a tree, or\r\nseek food by the tillage of the land; but they are perpetually wandering\r\nover various and extensive districts, having no home, no fixed abode or\r\nlaws; nor can they endure to remain long in the same climate, no one\r\ndistrict or country pleasing them for a continuance.\r\n\r\n4. Their life is one continued wandering; their wives are hired, on\r\nspecial covenant, for a fixed time; and that there may be some\r\nappearance of marriage in the business, the intended wife, under the\r\nname of a dowry, offers a spear and a tent to her husband, with a right\r\nto quit him after a fixed day, if she should choose to do so. And it is\r\ninconceivable with what eagerness the individuals of both sexes give\r\nthemselves up to matrimonial pleasures.\r\n\r\n5. But as long as they live they wander about with such extensive and\r\nperpetual migrations, that the woman is married in one place, brings\r\nforth her children in another, and rears them at a distance from either\r\nplace, no opportunity of remaining quiet being ever granted to her.\r\n\r\n6. They all live on venison, and are further supported on a great\r\nabundance of milk, and on many kinds of herbs, and on whatever birds\r\nthey can catch by fowling. And we have seen a great many of them wholly\r\nignorant of the use of either corn or wine.\r\n\r\n7. So much for this most mischievous nation. Now let us return to the\r\nsubject we originally proposed to ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n§ 1. While these events were taking place in the East, Constantius was\r\npassing the winter at Arles; and after an exhibition of games in the\r\ntheatre and in the circus, which were displayed with most sumptuous\r\nmagnificence, on the tenth of October, the day which completed the\r\nthirtieth year of his reign, he began to give the reins more freely to\r\nhis insolence, believing every information which was laid before him as\r\nproved, however doubtful or false it might be; and among other acts of\r\ncruelty, he put Gerontius, a count of the party of Magnentius, to the\r\ntorture, and then condemned him to banishment.\r\n\r\n2. And as the body of a sick man is apt to be agitated by even trifling\r\ngrievances, so his narrow and sensitive mind, thinking every sound that\r\nstirred something either done or planned to the injury of his safety,\r\nmade his victory[6] mournful by the slaughter of innocent men.\r\n\r\n3. For if any one of his military officers, or of those who had ever\r\nreceived marks of honour, or if any one of high rank was accused, on the\r\nbarest rumour, of having favoured the faction of his enemy, he was\r\nloaded with chains and dragged about like a beast. And whether any enemy\r\nof the accused man pressed him or not, as if the mere fact that his\r\nname had been mentioned was sufficient, every one who was informed\r\nagainst or in any way called in question, was condemned either to death,\r\nor to confiscation of his property, or to confinement in a desert\r\nisland.\r\n\r\n4. For his ferocity was excited to a still further degree when any\r\nmention was made of treason or sedition; and the bloodthirsty\r\ninsinuations of those around him, exaggerating everything that happened,\r\nand pretending great concern at any danger which might threaten the life\r\nof the emperor, on whose safety, as on a thread, they hypocritically\r\nexclaimed the whole world depended, added daily to his suspicions and\r\nwatchful anger.\r\n\r\n5. And therefore it is reported he gave orders that no one who was at\r\nany time sentenced to punishment for these or similar offences should be\r\nreadmitted to his presence for the purpose of offering the usual\r\ntestimonies to his character, a thing which the most implacable princes\r\nhave been wont to permit. And thus deadly cruelty, which in all other\r\nmen at times grows cool, in him only became more violent as he advanced\r\nin years, because the court of flatterers which attended on him added\r\ncontinual fuel to his stern obstinacy.\r\n\r\n6. Of this court a most conspicuous member was Paulus, the secretary, a\r\nnative of Spain, a man keeping his objects hidden beneath a smooth\r\ncountenance, and acute beyond all men in smelling out secret ways to\r\nbring others into danger. He, having been sent into Britain to arrest\r\nsome military officers who had dared to favour the conspiracy of\r\nMagnentius, as they could not resist, licentiously exceeded his\r\ncommands, and like a flood poured with sudden violence upon the fortunes\r\nof a great number of people, making his path through manifold slaughter\r\nand destruction, loading the bodies of free-born men with chains, and\r\ncrushing some with fetters, while patching up all kinds of accusations\r\nfar removed from the truth. And to this man is owing one especial\r\natrocity which has branded the time of Constantius with indelible\r\ninfamy.\r\n\r\n7. Martinus, who at that time governed these provinces as deputy, being\r\ngreatly concerned for the sufferings inflicted on innocent men, and\r\nmaking frequent entreaties that those who were free from all guilt\r\nmight be spared, when he found that he could not prevail, threatened to\r\nwithdraw from the province, in the hope that this malevolent inquisitor,\r\nPaulus, might be afraid of his doing so, and so give over exposing to\r\nopen danger men who had combined only in a wish for tranquillity.\r\n\r\n8. Paulus, thinking that this conduct of Martinus was a hindrance to his\r\nown zeal, being, as he was, a formidable artist in involving matters,\r\nfrom which people gave him the nickname of \"the Chain,\" attacked the\r\ndeputy himself while still engaged in defending the people whom he was\r\nset to govern, and involved him in the dangers which surrounded every\r\none else, threatening that he would carry him, with his tribunes and\r\nmany other persons, as a prisoner to the emperor's court. Martinus,\r\nalarmed at this threat, and seeing the imminent danger in which his life\r\nwas, drew his sword and attacked Paulus. But because from want of\r\nstrength in his hand he was unable to give him a mortal wound, he then\r\nplunged his drawn sword into his own side. And by this unseemly kind of\r\ndeath that most just man departed from life, merely for having dared to\r\ninterpose some delay to the miserable calamities of many citizens.\r\n\r\n9. And when these wicked deeds had been perpetrated, Paulus, covered\r\nwith blood, returned to the emperor's camp, bringing with him a crowd of\r\nprisoners almost covered with chains, in the lowest condition of squalor\r\nand misery; on whose arrival the racks were prepared, and the\r\nexecutioner began to prepare his hooks and other engines of torture. Of\r\nthese prisoners, many of them had their property confiscated, others\r\nwere sentenced to banishment, some were given over to the sword of the\r\nexecutioner. Nor is it easy to cite the acquittal of a single person in\r\nthe time of Constantius, where the slightest whisper of accusation had\r\nbeen brought against him.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n§ 1. At this time Orfitus was the governor of the Eternal City, with the\r\nrank of prefect; and he behaved with a degree of insolence beyond the\r\nproper limits of the dignity thus conferred upon him. A man of prudence\r\nindeed, and well skilled in all the forensic business of the city, but\r\nless accomplished in general literature and in the fine arts than was\r\nbecoming in a nobleman. Under his administration some very formidable\r\nseditions broke out in consequence of the scarcity of wine, as the\r\npeople, being exceedingly eager for an abundant use of that article,\r\nwere easily excited to frequent and violent disorders.\r\n\r\n2. And since I think it likely that foreigners who may read this account\r\n(if, indeed, any such should meet with it) are likely to wonder how it\r\nis that, when my history has reached the point of narrating what was\r\ndone at Rome, nothing is spoken of but seditions, and shops, and\r\ncheapness, and other similarly inconsiderable matters, I will briefly\r\ntouch upon the causes of this, never intentionally departing from the\r\nstrict truth.\r\n\r\n3. At the time when Rome first rose into mundane brilliancy--that Rome\r\nwhich was fated to last as long as mankind shall endure, and to be\r\nincreased with a sublime progress and growth--virtue and fortune, though\r\ncommonly at variance, agreed upon a treaty of eternal peace, as far as\r\nshe was concerned. For if either of them had been wanting to her, she\r\nwould never have reached her perfect and complete supremacy.\r\n\r\n4. Her people, from its very earliest infancy to the latest moment of\r\nits youth, a period which extends over about three hundred years,\r\ncarried on a variety of wars with the natives around its walls. Then,\r\nwhen it arrived at its full-grown manhood, after many and various\r\nlabours in war, it crossed the Alps and the sea, till, as youth and man,\r\nit had carried the triumphs of victory into every country in the world.\r\n\r\n5. And now that it is declining into old age, and often owes its\r\nvictories to its mere name, it has come to a more tranquil time of life.\r\nTherefore the venerable city, after having bowed down the haughty necks\r\nof fierce nations, and given laws to the world, to be the foundations\r\nand eternal anchors of liberty, like a thrifty parent, prudent and rich,\r\nintrusted to the Cæsars, as to its own children, the right of governing\r\ntheir ancestral inheritance.\r\n\r\n6. And although the tribes are indolent, and the countries peaceful, and\r\nalthough there are no contests for votes, but the tranquillity of the\r\nage of Numa has returned, nevertheless, in every quarter of the world\r\nRome is still looked up to as the mistress and the queen of the earth,\r\nand the name of the Roman people is respected and venerated.\r\n\r\n7. But this magnificent splendour of the assemblies and councils of the\r\nRoman people is defaced by the inconsiderate levity of a few, who never\r\nrecollect where they have been born, but who fall away into error and\r\nlicentiousness, as if a perfect impunity were granted to vice. For as\r\nthe lyric poet Simonides teaches us, the man who would live happily in\r\naccordance with perfect reason, ought above all things to have a\r\nglorious country.\r\n\r\n8. Of these men, some thinking that they can be handed down to\r\nimmortality by means of statues, are eagerly desirous of them, as if\r\nthey would obtain a higher reward from brazen figures unendowed with\r\nsense than from a consciousness of upright and honourable actions; and\r\nthey even are anxious to have them plated over with gold, a thing which\r\nis reported to have been first done in the instance of Acilius Glabrio,\r\nwho by his wisdom and valour had subdued King Antiochus. But how really\r\nnoble a thing it is to despise all these inconsiderable and trifling\r\nthings, and to bend one's attention to the long and toilsome steps of\r\ntrue glory, as the poet of Ascrea[7] has sung, and Cato the Censor has\r\nshown by his example. For when he was asked how it was that while many\r\nother nobles had statues he had none, replied: \"I had rather that good\r\nmen should marvel how it was that I did not earn one, than (what would\r\nbe a much heavier misfortune) inquire how it was that I had obtained\r\none.\"\r\n\r\n9. Others place the height of glory in having a coach higher than usual,\r\nor splendid apparel; and so toil and sweat under a vast burden of\r\ncloaks, which are fastened to their necks by many clasps, and blow about\r\nfrom the excessive fineness of the material; showing a desire, by the\r\ncontinual wriggling of their bodies, and especially by the waving of the\r\nleft hand, to make their long fringes and tunics, embroidered in\r\nmultiform figures of animals with threads of various colours, more\r\nconspicuous.\r\n\r\n10. Others, with not any one asking them, put on a feigned severity of\r\ncountenance, and extol their patrimonial estates in a boundless degree,\r\nexaggerating the yearly produce of their fruitful fields, which they\r\nboast of possessing in numbers from east to west, being forsooth\r\nignorant that their ancestors, by whom the greatness of Rome was so\r\nwidely extended, were not eminent for riches; but through a course of\r\ndreadful wars overpowered by their valour all who were opposed to them,\r\nthough differing but little from the common soldiers either in riches,\r\nor in their mode of life, or in the costliness of their garments.\r\n\r\n11. This is how it happened that Valerius Publicola was buried by the\r\ncontributions of his friends, and that the destitute wife of Regulus\r\nwas, with her children, supported by the aid of the friends of her\r\nhusband, and that the daughter of Scipio had a dowry provided for her\r\nout of the public treasury, the other nobles being ashamed to see the\r\nbeauty of this full-grown maiden, while her moneyless father was so long\r\nabsent on the service of his country.\r\n\r\n12. But now if you, as an honourable stranger, should enter the house of\r\nany one well off, and on that account full of pride, for the purpose of\r\nsaluting him, at first, indeed, you will be hospitably received, as\r\nthough your presence had been desired; and after having had many\r\nquestions put to you, and having been forced to tell a number of lies,\r\nyou will wonder, since the man had never seen you before, that one of\r\nhigh rank should pay such attention to you who are but an unimportant\r\nindividual; so that by reason of this as a principal source of\r\nhappiness, you begin to repent of not having come to Rome ten years ago.\r\n\r\n13. And when relying on this affability you do the same thing the next\r\nday, you will stand waiting as one utterly unknown and unexpected, while\r\nhe who yesterday encouraged you to repeat your visit, counts upon his\r\nfingers who you can be, marvelling, for a long time, whence you come,\r\nand what you want. But when at length you are recognized and admitted to\r\nhis acquaintance, if you should devote yourself to the attention of\r\nsaluting him for three years consecutively, and after this intermit your\r\nvisits for an equal length of time, then if you return to repeat a\r\nsimilar course, you will never be questioned about your absence any more\r\nthan if you had been dead, and you will waste your whole life in\r\nsubmitting to court the humours of this blockhead.\r\n\r\n14. But when those long and unwholesome banquets, which are indulged in\r\nat certain intervals, begin to be prepared, or the distribution of the\r\nusual dole-baskets takes place, then it is discussed with anxious\r\ndeliberation whether when those to whom a return is due are to be\r\nentertained, it is proper to invite also a stranger; and if, after the\r\nmatter has been thoroughly sifted, it is determined that it may be done,\r\nthat person is preferred who waits all night before the houses of\r\ncharioteers, or who professes a skill in dice, or pretends to be\r\nacquainted with some peculiar secrets.\r\n\r\n15. For such entertainers avoid all learned and sober men as\r\nunprofitable and useless; with this addition, that the nomenclators[8]\r\nalso, who are accustomed to make a market of these invitations and of\r\nsimilar favours, selling them for bribes, do for gain thrust in mean and\r\nobscure men at these dinners.\r\n\r\n16. The whirlpools of banquets, and the various allurements of luxury, I\r\nomit, that I may not be too prolix, and with the object of passing on to\r\nthis fact, that some people, hastening on without fear of danger, drive\r\ntheir horses, as if they were post-horses, with a regular licence, as\r\nthe saying is, through the wide streets of the city, over the roads\r\npaved with flint, dragging behind them large bodies of slaves like bands\r\nof robbers; not leaving at home even Sannio,[9] as the comic poet says.\r\n\r\n17. And many matrons, imitating these men, gallop over every quarter of\r\nthe city with their heads covered, and in close carriages. And as\r\nskilful conductors of battles place in the van their densest and\r\nstrongest battalions, then their light-armed troops, behind them the\r\ndarters, and in the extreme rear troops of reserve, ready to join in the\r\nattack if necessity should arise; so, according to the careful\r\narrangements of the stewards of these city households, who are\r\nconspicuous by wands fastened to their right hands, as if a regular\r\nwatchword had been issued from the camp, first of all, near the front\r\nof the carriage march all the slaves concerned in spinning and working;\r\nnext to them come the blackened crew employed in the kitchen; then the\r\nwhole body of slaves promiscuously mixed up with a gang of idle\r\nplebeians from the neighbourhood; last of all, the multitude of eunuchs,\r\nbeginning with the old men and ending with the boys, pale and unsightly\r\nfrom the distorted deformity of their features; so that whichever way\r\nany one goes, seeing troops of mutilated men, he will detest the memory\r\nof Semiramis, that ancient queen who was the first person to castrate\r\nmale youths of tender age; doing as it were a violence to nature, and\r\nforcing it back from its appointed course, which at the very first\r\nbeginning and birth of the child, by a kind of secret law revealing the\r\nprimitive fountains of seed, points out the way of propagating\r\nposterity.\r\n\r\n18. And as this is the case, those few houses which were formerly\r\ncelebrated for the serious cultivation of becoming studies, are now\r\nfilled with the ridiculous amusements of torpid indolence, re-echoing\r\nwith the sound of vocal music and the tinkle of flutes and lyres.\r\nLastly, instead of a philosopher, you find a singer; instead of an\r\norator, some teacher of ridiculous arts is summoned; and the libraries\r\nclosed for ever, like so many graves; organs to be played by water-power\r\nare made; and lyres of so vast a size, that they look like waggons; and\r\nflutes, and ponderous machines suited for the exhibitions of actors.\r\n\r\n19. Last of all, they have arrived at such a depth of unworthiness, that\r\nwhen, no very long time ago, on account of an apprehended scarcity of\r\nfood, the foreigners were driven in haste from the city; those who\r\npractised liberal accomplishments, the number of whom was exceedingly\r\nsmall, were expelled without a moment's breathing-time; yet the\r\nfollowers of actresses, and all who at that time pretended to be of such\r\na class, were allowed to remain; and three thousand dancing-girls had\r\nnot even a question put to them, but stayed unmolested with the members\r\nof their choruses, and a corresponding number of dancing masters.\r\n\r\n20. And wherever you turn your eyes, you may see a multitude of women\r\nwith their hair curled, who, as far as their age goes, might, if they\r\nhad married, been by this time the mothers of three children, sweeping\r\nthe pavements with their feet till they are weary, whirling round in\r\nrapid gyrations, while representing innumerable groups and figures\r\nwhich the theatrical plays contain.\r\n\r\n21. It is a truth beyond all question, that, when at one time Rome was\r\nthe abode of all the virtues, many of the nobles, like the Lotophagi,\r\ncelebrated in Homer, who detained men by the deliciousness of their\r\nfruit, allured foreigners of free birth by manifold attentions of\r\ncourtesy and kindness.\r\n\r\n22. But now, in their empty arrogance, some persons look upon everything\r\nas worthless which is born outside of the walls of the city, except only\r\nthe childless and the unmarried. Nor can it be conceived with what a\r\nvariety of obsequious observance men without children are courted at\r\nRome.\r\n\r\n23. And since among them, as is natural in a city so great as to be the\r\nmetropolis of the world, diseases attain to such an insurmountable\r\ndegree of violence, that all the skill of the physician is ineffectual\r\neven to mitigate them; a certain assistance and means of safety has been\r\ndevised, in the rule that no one should go to see a friend in such a\r\ncondition, and to a few precautionary measures a further remedy of\r\nsufficient potency has been added, that men should not readmit into\r\ntheir houses servants who have been sent to inquire how a man's friends\r\nwho may have been seized with an illness of this kind are, until they\r\nhave cleansed and purified their persons in the bath. So that a taint is\r\nfeared, even when it has only been seen with the eyes of another.\r\n\r\n24. But nevertheless, when these rules are observed thus stringently,\r\nsome persons, if they be invited to a wedding, though the vigour of\r\ntheir limbs be much diminished, yet, when gold is offered[10] in the\r\nhollow palm of the right hand, will go actively as far as Spoletum.\r\nThese are the customs of the nobles.\r\n\r\n25. But of the lower and most indigent class of the populace some spend\r\nthe whole night in the wine shops. Some lie concealed in the shady\r\narcades of the theatres; which Catulus was in his ædileship the first\r\nperson to raise, in imitation of the lascivious manners of Campania, or\r\nelse they play at dice so eagerly as to quarrel over them; snuffing up\r\ntheir nostrils and making unseemly noises by drawing back their breath\r\ninto their noses; or (and this is their favourite pursuit of all others)\r\nfrom sunrise to evening they stay gaping through sunshine or rain,\r\nexamining in the most careful manner the most sterling good or bad\r\nqualities of the charioteers and horses.\r\n\r\n26. And it is very wonderful to see an innumerable multitude of people\r\nwith great eagerness of mind intent upon the event of the contests in\r\nthe chariot race. These pursuits, and others of like character, prevent\r\nanything worth mentioning or important from being done at Rome.\r\nTherefore we must return to our original subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. His licentiousness having now become more unbounded, the Cæsar\r\nbegan to be burdensome to all virtuous men; and discarding all\r\nmoderation, he harassed every part of the East, sparing neither those\r\nwho had received public honours, nor the chief citizens of the different\r\ncities; nor the common people.\r\n\r\n2. At last by one single sentence he ordered all the principal persons\r\nat Antioch to be put to death; being exasperated because when he\r\nrecommended that a low price should be established in the market at an\r\nunseasonable time, when the city was threatened with a scarcity, they\r\nanswered him with objections, urged with more force than he approved;\r\nand they would all have been put to death to a man, if Honoratus, who\r\nwas at that time count of the East, had not resisted him with\r\npertinacious constancy.\r\n\r\n3. This circumstance was also a proof, and that no doubtful or concealed\r\none, of the cruelty of his nature, that he took delight in cruel sports,\r\nand in the circus he would rejoice as if he had made some great gain, to\r\nsee six or seven gladiators killing one another in combats which have\r\noften been forbidden.\r\n\r\n4. In addition to these things a certain worthless woman inflamed his\r\npurpose of inflicting misery; for she, having obtained admission to the\r\npalace, as she had requested, gave him information that a plot was\r\nsecretly laid against him by a few soldiers of the lowest rank. And\r\nConstantina, in her exultation, thinking that her husband's safety was\r\nnow fully secured, rewarded and placed this woman, in a carriage, and in\r\nthis way sent her out into the public street through the great gate of\r\nthe palace, in order, by such a temptation, to allure others also to\r\ngive similar or more important information.\r\n\r\n5. After these events, Gallus being about to set out for Hierapolis, in\r\norder, as far as appearance went, to take part in the expedition, the\r\ncommon people of Antioch entreated him in a suppliant manner to remove\r\ntheir fear of a famine which for many reasons (some of them difficult to\r\nexplain) it was believed was impending; Gallus, however, did not, as is\r\nthe custom of princes whose power, by the great extent of country over\r\nwhich it is diffused, is able continually to remedy local distresses,\r\norder any distribution of food to be made, or any supplies to be brought\r\nfrom the neighbouring countries; but he pointed out to them a man of\r\nconsular rank, named Theophilus, the governor of Syria, who happened to\r\nbe standing by, replying to the repeated appeals of the multitude, who\r\nwere trembling with apprehensions of the last extremities, that no one\r\ncould possibly want food if the governor were not willing that they\r\nshould be in want of it.\r\n\r\n6. These words increased the audacity of the lower classes, and when the\r\nscarcity of provisions became more severe, urged by hunger and frenzy,\r\nthey set fire to and burnt down the splendid house of a man of the name\r\nof Eubulus, a man of great reputation among his fellow-citizens; and\r\nthey attacked the governor himself with blows and kicks as one\r\nespecially made over to them by the judgment of the emperor, kicking him\r\ntill he was half dead, and then tearing him to pieces in a miserable\r\nmanner. And after his wretched death every one saw in the destruction of\r\nthis single individual a type of the danger to which he was himself\r\nexposed, and, taught by this recent example, feared a similar fate.\r\n\r\n7. About the same time Serenianus, who had previously been duke[11] of\r\nPhoenicia, to whose inactivity it was owing, as we have already\r\nrelated, that Celse in Phoenicia was laid waste, was deservedly and\r\nlegally accused of treason and no one saw how he could possibly be\r\nacquitted. He was also manifestly proved to have sent an intimate friend\r\nwith a cap (with which he used to cover his own head) which had been\r\nenchanted by forbidden acts to the temple of prophecy,[12] on purpose to\r\nask expressly whether, according to his wish, a firm enjoyment of the\r\nwhole empire was portended for him.\r\n\r\n8. And in these days a twofold misfortune occurred: first, that a heavy\r\npenalty had fallen upon Theophilus who was innocent; and, secondly, that\r\nSerenianus who deserved universal execration, was acquitted without the\r\ngeneral feeling being able to offer any effectual remonstrance.\r\n\r\n9. Constantius then hearing from time to time of these transactions, and\r\nhaving been further informed of some particular occurrences by\r\nThalassius, who however had now died by the ordinary course of nature,\r\nwrote courteous letters to the Cæsar, but at the same time gradually\r\nwithdrew from him his support, pretending to be uneasy, least as the\r\nleisure of soldiers is usually a disorderly time, the troops might be\r\nconspiring to his injury: and he desired him to content himself with the\r\nschools of the Palatine,[13] and with those of the Protectors, with the\r\nScutarii, and Gentiles. And he ordered Domitianus, who had formerly been\r\nthe Superintendent of the Treasury, but who was now promoted to be a\r\nprefect, as soon as he arrived in Syria, to address Gallus in persuasive\r\nand respectful language, exhorting him to repair with all speed to\r\nItaly, to which province the emperor had repeatedly summoned him.\r\n\r\n10. And when, with this object, Domitianus had reached Antioch, having\r\ntravelled express, he passed by the gates of the palace, in contempt of\r\nthe Cæsar, whom, however, he ought to have visited, and proceeded to the\r\ngeneral's camp with ostentatious pomp, and there pretended to be sick;\r\nhe neither visited the palace, nor ever appeared in public, but keeping\r\nhimself private, he devised many things to bring about the destruction\r\nof the Cæsar, adding many superfluous circumstances to the relations\r\nwhich he was continually sending to the emperor.\r\n\r\n11. At last, being expressly invited by the Cæsar, and being admitted\r\ninto the prince's council-chamber, without making the slightest preface\r\nhe began in this inconsiderate and light-minded manner: \"Depart,\" said\r\nhe, \"as you have been commanded, O Cæsar, and know this, that if you\r\nmake any delay I shall at once order all the provisions allotted for the\r\nsupport of yourself and your court to be carried away.\" And then, having\r\nsaid nothing more than these insolent words, he departed with every\r\nappearance of rage; and would never afterwards come into his sight\r\nthough frequently sent for.\r\n\r\n12. The Cæsar being indignant at this, as thinking he had been\r\nunworthily and unjustly treated, ordered his faithful protectors to take\r\nthe prefect into custody; and when this became known, Montius, who at\r\nthat time was quæstor, a man of deep craft indeed, but still inclined to\r\nmoderate measures,[14] taking counsel for the common good, sent for the\r\nprincipal members of the Palatine schools and addressed them in pacific\r\nwords, pointing out that it was neither proper nor expedient that such\r\nthings should be done; and adding also in a reproving tone of voice,\r\nthat if such conduct as this were approved of, then, after throwing down\r\nthe statues of Constantius the prefect would begin to think how he might\r\nalso with the greater security take his life also.\r\n\r\n13. When this was known Gallus, like a serpent attacked with stones or\r\ndarts, being now reduced to the extremity of despair, and eager to\r\ninsure his safety by any possible means, ordered all his troops to be\r\ncollected in arms, and when they stood around him in amazement he\r\ngnashed his teeth, and hissing with rage, said,--\r\n\r\n14. \"You are present here as brave men, come to the aid of me who am in\r\none common danger with you. Montius, with a novel and unprecedented\r\narrogance, accuses us of rebellion and resistance to the majesty of the\r\nemperor, by roaring out all these charges against us. Being offended\r\nforsooth that, as a matter of precaution, I ordered a contumacious\r\nprefect, who pretended not to know what the state of affairs required,\r\nto be arrested and kept in custody.\"\r\n\r\n15. On hearing these words the soldiers immediately, being always on the\r\nwatch to raise disturbances, first of all attacked Montius, who happened\r\nto be living close at hand, an old man of no great bodily strength, and\r\nenfeebled by disease; and having bound his legs with coarse ropes, they\r\ndragged him straddling, without giving him a moment to take breath, as\r\nfar as the general's camp.\r\n\r\n16. And with the same violence they also bound Domitianus, dragging him\r\nhead first down the stairs; and then having fastened the two men\r\ntogether, they dragged them through all the spacious streets of the city\r\nat full speed. And, all their limbs and joints being thus dislocated,\r\nthey trampled on their corpses after they were dead, and mutilated them\r\nin the most unseemly manner; and at last, having glutted their rage,\r\nthey threw them into the river.\r\n\r\n17. But there was a certain man named Luscus, the governor of the city,\r\nwho, suddenly appearing among the soldiers, had inflamed them, always\r\nready for mischief, to the nefarious actions which they had thus\r\ncommitted; exciting them with repeated cries, like the musician who\r\ngives the tune to the mourners at funerals, to finish what they had\r\nbegun: and for this deed he was, not long after, burnt alive.\r\n\r\n18. And because Montius, when just about to expire under the hands of\r\nthose who were tearing him to pieces, repeatedly named Epigonius and\r\nEusebius, without indicating either their rank or their profession, a\r\ngreat deal of trouble was taken to find out who they were; and, lest the\r\nsearch should have time to cool, they sent for a philosopher named\r\nEpigonius, from Lycia, and for Eusebius the orator, surnamed Pittacos,\r\nfrom Emissa; though they were not those whom Montius had meant, but\r\nsome tribunes, superintendents of the manufactures of arms, who had\r\npromised him information if they heard of any revolutionary measures\r\nbeing agitated.\r\n\r\n19. About the same time Apollinaris, the son-in-law of Domitianus, who a\r\nshort time before had been the chief steward of the Cæsar's palace,\r\nbeing sent to Mesopotamia by his father-in-law, took exceeding pains to\r\ninquire among the soldiers whether they had received any secret\r\ndespatches from the Cæsar, indicating his having meditated any deeper\r\ndesigns than usual. And as soon as he heard of the events which had\r\ntaken place at Antioch, he passed through the lesser Armenia and took\r\nthe road to Constantinople; but he was seized on his journey by the\r\nProtectors, and brought back to Antioch, and there kept in close\r\nconfinement.\r\n\r\n20. And while these things were taking place there was discovered at\r\nTyre a royal robe, which had been secretly made, though it was quite\r\nuncertain who had placed it where it was, or for whose use it had been\r\nmade. And on that account the governor of the province, who was at that\r\ntime the father of Apollinaris, and bore the same name, was arrested as\r\nan accomplice in his guilt; and great numbers of other persons were\r\ncollected from different cities, who were all involved in serious\r\naccusations.\r\n\r\n21. And now, when the trumpets of internal war and slaughter began to\r\nsound, the turbulent disposition of the Cæsar, indifferent to any\r\nconsideration of the truth, began also to break forth, and that not\r\nsecretly as before. And without making any solemn investigation into the\r\ntruth of the charges brought against the citizens, and without\r\nseparating the innocent from the guilty, he discarded all ideas of right\r\nor justice, as if they had been expelled from the seat of judgment. And\r\nwhile all lawful defence on trials was silent, the torturer, and\r\nplunderer, and the executioner, and every kind of confiscation of\r\nproperty, raged unrestrained throughout the eastern provinces of the\r\nempire, which I think it now a favourable moment to enumerate, with the\r\nexception of Mesopotamia, which I have already described when I was\r\nrelating the Parthian wars; and also with the exception of Egypt, which\r\nI am forced to postpone to another opportunity.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. After passing over the summit of Mount Taurus, which towards the\r\neast rises up to a vast height, Cilicia spreads itself out for a very\r\ngreat distance--a land rich in all valuable productions. It is bordered\r\non its right by Isauria, which is equally fertile in vines and in many\r\nkinds of grain. The Calycadnus, a navigable river, flows through the\r\nmiddle of Isaurus.\r\n\r\n2. This province, besides other towns, is particularly adorned by two\r\ncities, Seleucia, founded by King Seleucus, and Claudiopolis, which the\r\nEmperor Claudius Cæsar established as a colony. For the city of Isauria,\r\nwhich was formerly too powerful, was in ancient times overthrown as an\r\nincurable and dangerous rebel, and so completely destroyed that it is\r\nnot easy to discover any traces of its pristine splendour.\r\n\r\n3. The province of Cilicia, which exults in the river Cydnus, is\r\nornamented by Tarsus, a city of great magnificence. This city is said to\r\nhave been founded by Perseus, the son of Jupiter and Danaë; or else, and\r\nmore probably, by a certain emigrant who came from Ethiopia, by name\r\nSandan, a man of great wealth and of noble birth. It is also adorned by\r\nthe city of Anazarbus, which bears the name of its founder; and by\r\nMopsuestia, the abode of the celebrated seer Mopsus, who wandered from\r\nhis comrades the Argonauts when they were returning after having carried\r\noff the Golden Fleece, and strayed to the African coast, where he died a\r\nsudden death. His heroic remains, though covered by Punic turf, have\r\never since that time cured a great variety of diseases, and have\r\ngenerally restored men to sound health.\r\n\r\n4. These two provinces being full of banditti were formerly subdued by\r\nthe proconsul Servilius, in a piratical war, and were passed under the\r\nyoke, and made tributary to the empire. These districts being placed, as\r\nit were, on a prominent tongue of land, are cut off from the main\r\ncontinent by Mount Amanus.\r\n\r\n5. The frontier of the East stretching straight forward for a great\r\ndistance, reached from the banks of the river Euphrates to those of the\r\nNile, being bounded on the left by the tribes of the Saracens and on\r\nthe right by the sea.\r\n\r\n6. Nicator Seleucus, after he had occupied that district, increased its\r\nprosperity to a wonderful degree, when, after the death of Alexander,\r\nking of Macedonia, he took possession of the kingdom of Persia by right\r\nof succession; being a mighty and victorious king, as his surname\r\nindicates. And making free use of his numerous subjects, whom he\r\ngoverned for a long time in tranquillity, he changed groups of rustic\r\nhabitations into regular cities, important for their great wealth and\r\npower, the greater part of which at the present day, although they are\r\ncalled by Greek names which were given them by the choice of their\r\nfounder, have nevertheless not lost their original appellations which\r\nthe original settlers of the villages gave them in the Assyrian\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\n7. After Osdroene, which, as I have already said, I intend to omit from\r\nthis description, the first province to be mentioned is Commagena, now\r\ncalled Euphratensis, which has arisen into importance by slow degrees,\r\nand is remarkable for the splendid cities of Hierapolis, the ancient\r\nNinus, and Samosata.\r\n\r\n8. The next province is Syria, which is spread over a beautiful\r\nchampaign country. This province is ennobled by Antioch, a city known\r\nover the whole world, with which no other can vie in respect of its\r\nriches, whether imported or natural: and by Laodicea and Apameia, and\r\nalso by Seleucia, all cities which have ever been most prosperous from\r\ntheir earliest foundation.\r\n\r\n9. After this comes Phoenicia, a province lying under Mount Lebanon,\r\nfull of beauty and elegance, and decorated with cities of great size and\r\nsplendour, among which Tyre excels all in the beauty of its situation\r\nand in its renown. And next come Sidon and Berytus, and on a par with\r\nthem Emissa and Damascus, cities founded in remote ages.\r\n\r\n10. These provinces, which the river Orontes borders, a river which\r\npasses by the foot of the celebrated and lofty mountain Cassius, and at\r\nlast falls into the Levant near the Gulf of Issus, were added to the\r\nRoman dominion by Cnæus Pompey, who, after he had conquered Tigranes,\r\nseparated them from the kingdom of Armenia.\r\n\r\n11. The last province of the Syrias is Palestine, a district of great\r\nextent, abounding in well-cultivated and beautiful land, and having\r\nseveral magnificent cities, all of equal importance, and rivalling one\r\nanother as it were, in parallel lines. For instance, Cæsarea, which\r\nHerod built in honour of the Prince Octavianus, and Eleutheropolis, and\r\nNeapolis, and also Ascalon, and Gaza, cities built in bygone ages.\r\n\r\n12. In these districts no navigable river is seen: in many places, too,\r\nwaters naturally hot rise out of the ground well suited for the cure of\r\nvarious diseases. These regions also Pompey formed into a Roman province\r\nafter he had subdued the Jews and taken Jerusalem: and he made over\r\ntheir government to a local governor.\r\n\r\n13. Contiguous to Palestine is Arabia, a country which on its other side\r\njoins the Nabathæi--a land full of the most plenteous variety of\r\nmerchandize, and studded with strong forts and castles, which the\r\nwatchful solicitude of its ancient inhabitants has erected in suitable\r\ndefiles, in order to repress the inroads of the neighbouring nations.\r\nThis province, too, besides several towns, has some mighty cities, such\r\nas Bostra, Gerasa, and Philadelphia, fortified with very strong walls.\r\nIt was the Emperor Trajan who first gave this country the name of a\r\nRoman province, and appointed a governor over it, and compelled it to\r\nobey our laws, after having by repeated victories crushed the arrogance\r\nof the inhabitants, when he was carrying his glorious arms into Media\r\nand Parthia.\r\n\r\n14. There is also the island of Cyprus, not very far from the continent,\r\nand abounding in excellent harbours, which, besides its many municipal\r\ntowns, is especially famous for two renowned cities, Salamis and Paphos,\r\nthe one celebrated for its temple of Jupiter, the other for its temple\r\nof Venus. This same Cyprus is so fertile, and so abounding in riches of\r\nevery kind, that without requiring any external assistance, it can by\r\nits own native resources build a merchant ship from the very foundation\r\nof the keel up to the top sails, and send it to sea fully equipped with\r\nstores.\r\n\r\n15. It is not to be denied that the Roman people invaded this island\r\nwith more covetousness than justice. For when Ptolemy, the king, who was\r\nconnected with us by treaty, and was also our ally, was without any\r\nfault of his own proscribed, merely on account of the necessities of our\r\ntreasury, and slew himself by taking poison, the island was made\r\ntributary to us, and its spoils placed on board our fleet, as if taken\r\nfrom an enemy, and carried to Rome by Cato. We will now return to the\r\nactions of Constantius in their due order.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\n§ 1. Amid all these various disasters, Ursicinus, who was the governor\r\nof Nisibis, an officer to whom the command of the emperor had\r\nparticularly attached me as a servant, was summoned from that city, and\r\nin spite of his reluctance, and of the opposition which he made to the\r\nclamorous bands of flatterers, was forced to investigate the origin of\r\nthe pernicious strife which had arisen. He was indeed a soldier of great\r\nskill in war, and an approved leader of troops; but a man who had always\r\nkept himself aloof from the strife of the forum. He, alarmed at his own\r\ndanger when he saw the corrupt accusers and judges who were associated\r\nwith him, all emerging out of the same lurking-places, wrote secret\r\nletters to Constantius informing him of what was going on, both publicly\r\nand in secret; and imploring such assistance as, by striking fear into\r\nGallus, should somewhat curb his notorious arrogance.\r\n\r\n2. But through excessive caution he had fallen into a worse snare, as we\r\nshall relate hereafter, since his enemies got the opportunity of laying\r\nnumerous snares for him, to poison the mind of Constantius against him;\r\nConstantius, in other respects a prince of moderation, was severe and\r\nimplacable if any person, however mean and unknown, whispered suspicion\r\nof danger into his ears, and in such matters was wholly unlike himself.\r\n\r\n3. On the day appointed for this fatal examination, the master of the\r\nhorse took his seat under the pretence of being the judge; others being\r\nalso set as his assessors, who were instructed beforehand what was to be\r\ndone: and there were present also notaries on each side of him, who kept\r\nthe Cæsar rapidly and continually informed of all the questions which\r\nwere put and all the answers which were given; and by his pitiless\r\norders, urged as he was by the persuasions of the queen, who kept her\r\near at the curtain, many were put to death without being permitted to\r\nsoften the accusations brought against them, or to say a word in their\r\nown defence.\r\n\r\n4. The first persons who were brought before them were Epigonius and\r\nEusebius, who were ruined because of the similarity of their names to\r\nthose of other people; for we have already mentioned that Montius, when\r\njust at the point of death, had intended to inculpate the tribunes of\r\nmanufactures, who were called by these names, as men who had promised to\r\nbe his supports in some future enterprise.\r\n\r\n5. Epigonius was only a philosopher as far as his dress went, as was\r\nevident, when, having tried entreaties in vain, his sides having been\r\ntorn with blows, and the fear of instant death being presented to him,\r\nhe affirmed by a base confession that his companion was privy to his\r\nplans, though in fact he had no plans; nor had he ever seen or heard\r\nanything, being wholly unconnected with forensic affairs. But Eusebius,\r\nconfidently denying what he was accused of, continued firm in unshaken\r\nconstancy, loudly declaring that it was a band of robbers before whom he\r\nwas brought, and not a court of justice.\r\n\r\n6. And when, like a man well acquainted with the law, he demanded that\r\nhis accuser should be produced, and claimed the usual rights of a\r\nprisoner; the Cæsar, having heard of his conduct, and looking on his\r\nfreedom as pride, ordered him to be put to the torture as an audacious\r\ncalumniator; and when Eusebius had been tortured so severely that he had\r\nno longer any limbs left for torments, imploring heaven for justice, and\r\nstill smiling disdainfully, he remained immovable, with a firm heart,\r\nnot permitting his tongue to accuse himself or any one else. And so at\r\nlength, without having either made any confession, or being convicted of\r\nanything, he was condemned to death with the spiritless partner of his\r\nsufferings. He was then led away to death, protesting against the\r\niniquity of the times; imitating in his conduct the celebrated Stoic of\r\nold, Zeno, who, after he had been long subjected to torture in order to\r\nextract from him some false confession, tore out his tongue by the roots\r\nand threw it, bloody as it was, into the face of the king of Cyprus, who\r\nwas examining him.\r\n\r\n7. After these events the affair of the royal robe was examined into.\r\nAnd when those who were employed in dyeing purple had been put to the\r\ntorture, and had confessed that they had woven a short tunic to cover\r\nthe chest, without sleeves, a certain person, by name Maras, was brought\r\nin, a deacon, as the Christians call him; letters from whom were\r\nproduced, written in the Greek language to the superintendent of the\r\nweaving manufactory at Tyre, which pressed him to have the beautiful\r\nwork finished speedily; of which work, however, these letters gave no\r\nfurther description. And at last this man also was tortured, to the\r\ndanger of his life, but could not be made to confess anything.\r\n\r\n8. After the investigation had been carried on with the examination,\r\nunder torture of many persons, when some things appeared doubtful, and\r\nothers it was plain were of a very unimportant character, and after many\r\npersons had been put to death, the two Apollinares, father and son, were\r\ncondemned to banishment; and when they had come to a place which is\r\ncalled Crateræ, a country house of their own, which is four-and-twenty\r\nmiles from Antioch, there, according to the order which had been given,\r\ntheir legs were broken, and they were put to death.\r\n\r\n9. After their death Gallus was not at all less ferocious than before,\r\nbut rather like a lion which has once tasted blood, he made many similar\r\ninvestigations, all of which it is not worth while to relate, lest I\r\nshould exceed the bounds which I have laid down for myself; an error\r\nwhich is to be avoided.\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\n§ 1. While the East was thus for a long time suffering under these\r\ncalamities, at the first approach of open weather, Constantius being in\r\nhis seventh consulship, and the Cæsar in his third, the emperor quitted\r\nArles and went to Valentia, with the intention of making war upon the\r\nbrothers Gundomadus and Vadomarius, chiefs of the Allemanni; by whose\r\nrepeated inroads the territories of the Gauls, which lay upon their\r\nfrontier, were continually laid waste.\r\n\r\n2. And while he was staying in that district, as he did for some time\r\nwhile waiting for supplies, the importation of which from Aquitania was\r\nprevented by the spring rains which were this year more severe than\r\nusual, so that the rivers were flooded by them, Herculanus arrived, a\r\nprincipal officer of the guard, son of Hermogenes, who had formerly been\r\nmaster of the horse at Constantinople, and had been torn to pieces in a\r\npopular tumult as we have mentioned before. And as he brought a faithful\r\naccount of what Gallus had done, the emperor, sorrowing over the\r\nmiseries that were passed, and full of anxious fear for the future, for\r\na time stilled the grief of his mind as well as he could.\r\n\r\n3. But in the mean time all the soldiery being assembled at\r\nCabillon,[15] began to be impatient of delay, and to get furious, being\r\nso much the more exasperated because they had not sufficient means of\r\nliving, the usual supplies not yet having arrived.\r\n\r\n4. And in consequence of this state of things, Rufinus, at that time\r\nprefect of the camp, was exposed to the most imminent danger. For he\r\nhimself was compelled to go among the soldiers, whose natural ferocity\r\nwas inflamed by their want of food, and who on other occasions are by\r\nnature generally inclined to be savage and bitter against men of civil\r\ndignities. He was compelled, I say, to go among them to appease them and\r\nexplain on what account the arrival of their corn was delayed.\r\n\r\n5. And the task thus imposed on him was very cunningly contrived, in\r\norder that he, the uncle of Gallus, might perish in the snare; lest he,\r\nbeing a man of great power and energy, should rouse his nephew to\r\nconfidence, and lead him to undertake enterprises which might be\r\nmischievous. Great caution, however, was used to escape this; and, when\r\nthe danger was got rid of for a while, Eusebius, the high chamberlain,\r\nwas sent to Cabillon with a large sum of money, which he distributed\r\nsecretly among the chief leaders of sedition: and so the turbulent and\r\narrogant disposition of the soldiers was pacified, and the safety of the\r\nprefect secured. Afterwards food having arrived in abundance the camp\r\nwas struck on the day appointed.\r\n\r\n6. After great difficulties had been surmounted, many of the roads\r\nbeing buried in snow, the army came near to Rauracum[16] on the banks of\r\nthe Rhine, where the multitude of the Allemanni offered great\r\nresistance, so that by their fierceness the Romans were prevented from\r\nfixing their bridge of boats, darts being poured upon them from all\r\nsides like hail; and, when it seemed impossible to succeed in that\r\nattempt, the emperor being taken by surprise, and full of anxious\r\nthoughts, began to consider what to do.\r\n\r\n7. When suddenly a guide well acquainted with the country arrived, and\r\nfor a reward pointed out a ford by night, where the river could be\r\ncrossed; and the army crossing at that point, while the enemy had their\r\nattention directed elsewhere, might without any one expecting such a\r\nstep, have and waste the whole country, if a few men of the same nation\r\nto whom the higher posts in the Roman army were intrusted had not (as\r\nsome people believe) informed their fellow-countrymen of the design by\r\nsecret messengers.\r\n\r\n8. The disgrace of this suspicion fell chiefly on Latinus, a commander\r\nof the domestic guard, and on Agilo, an equerry, and on Scudilo, the\r\ncommander of the Scutarii, men who at that time were looked up to as\r\nthose who supported the republic with their right hands.\r\n\r\n9. But the barbarians, though taking instant counsel on such an\r\nemergency, yet either because the auspices turned out unfavourable, or\r\nbecause the authority of the sacrifices prohibited an instant\r\nengagement, abated their energy, and the confidence with which they had\r\nhitherto resisted; and sent some of their chiefs to beg pardon for their\r\noffences, and sue for peace.\r\n\r\n10. Therefore, having detained for some time the envoys of both the\r\nkings, and having long deliberated over the affair in secret, the\r\nemperor, when he had decided that it was expedient to grant peace on the\r\nterms proposed, summoned his army to an assembly with the intention of\r\nmaking them a short speech, and mounting the tribunal, surrounded with a\r\nstaff of officers of high rank, spoke in the following manner:\r\n\r\n11. \"I hope no one will wonder, after the long and toilsome marches we\r\nhave made, and the vast supplies and magazines which have been provided,\r\nfrom the confidence which I felt in you, that now although we are close\r\nto the villages of the barbarians, I have, as if I had suddenly changed\r\nmy plans, adopted more peaceful counsels.\r\n\r\n12. \"For if every one of you, having regard to his own position and his\r\nown feelings, considers the case, he will find this to be the truth:\r\nthat the individual soldier in all cases, however strong and vigorous he\r\nmay be, regards and defends nothing but himself and his own life; while\r\nthe general, looking on all with impartiality as the guardian of their\r\ngeneral safety, is aware that the common interest of the people cannot\r\nbe separated from his own safety; and he is bound to seize with alacrity\r\nevery remedy of which the condition of affairs admits, as being put into\r\nhis hand by the favour of the gods.\r\n\r\n13. \"That therefore I may in a few words set before you and explain on\r\nwhat account I wished all of you, my most faithful comrades, to assemble\r\nhere, I entreat you to listen attentively to what I will state with all\r\nthe brevity possible. For the language of truth is always concise and\r\nsimple.\r\n\r\n14. \"The kings and people of the Allemanni, viewing with apprehension\r\nthe lofty steps of your glory (which fame, increasing in magnificence,\r\nhas diffused throughout the most distant countries), now by their\r\nambassadors humbly implore pardon for their past offences, and peace.\r\nAnd this indulgence I, as a cautious and prudent adviser of what is\r\nuseful, think expedient to grant them, if your consent be not wanting:\r\nbeing led to this opinion by many considerations, in the first place\r\nthat so we may avoid the doubtful issues of war; in the second place,\r\nthat instead of enemies we may have allies, as they promise we shall\r\nfind them; further, that without bloodshed we may pacify their haughty\r\nferocity, a feeling which is often mischievous in our provinces; and\r\nlast of all, recollecting that the man who falls in battle, overwhelmed\r\nby superior weapons or strength, is not the only enemy who has to be\r\nsubdued; and that with much greater safety to the state, even while the\r\ntrumpet of war is silent, he is subdued who makes voluntary submission,\r\nhaving learnt by experience that we lack neither courage against rebels,\r\nnor mercy towards suppliants.\r\n\r\n15. \"To sum up, making you as it were the arbitrators, I wait to see\r\nwhat you determine: having no doubt myself, as an emperor always\r\ndesirous of peace, that it is best to employ moderation while prosperity\r\ndescends upon us. For, believe me, this conduct which I recommend, and\r\nwhich is wisely chosen, will not be imputed to want of courage on your\r\npart, but to your moderation and humanity.\"\r\n\r\n16. As soon as he had finished speaking, the whole assembly being ready\r\nto agree to what the emperor desired, and praising his advice, gave\r\ntheir votes for peace; being principally influenced by this\r\nconsideration, that they had already learnt by frequent expeditions that\r\nthe fortune of the emperor was only propitious in times of civil\r\ntroubles; but that when foreign wars were undertaken they had often\r\nproved disastrous. On this, therefore, a treaty being made according to\r\nthe customs of the Allemanni, and all the solemnities being completed,\r\nthe emperor retired to Milan for the winter.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\n§ 1. At Milan, having discarded the weight of other cares, the emperor\r\ntook into his consideration that most difficult gordian knot, how by a\r\nmighty effort to uproot the Cæsar. And while he was deliberating on this\r\nmatter with his friends in secret conference by night, and considering\r\nwhat force, and what contrivances might be employed for the purpose,\r\nbefore Gallus in his audacity should more resolutely set himself to\r\nplunging affairs into confusion, it seemed best that Gallus should be\r\ninvited by civil letters, under pretence of some public affairs of an\r\nurgent nature requiring his advice, so that, being deprived of all\r\nsupport, he might be put to death without any hindrance.\r\n\r\n2. But as several knots of light-minded flatterers opposed this opinion,\r\namong whom was Arbetio, a man of keen wit and always inclined to\r\ntreachery, and Eusebius, a man always disposed to mischief, at that time\r\nthe principal chamberlain, they suggested that if the Cæsar were to quit\r\nthose countries it would be dangerous to leave Ursicinus in the East,\r\nwith no one to check his designs, if he should cherish ambitious\r\nnotions.\r\n\r\n3. And these counsels were supported by the rest of the royal eunuchs,\r\nwhose avarice and covetousness at that period had risen to excess. These\r\nmen, while performing their private duties about the court, by secret\r\nwhispers supplied food for false accusations; and by raising bitter\r\nsuspicions of Ursicinus, ruined a most gallant man, creating by\r\nunderhand means a belief that his grown-up sons began to aim at supreme\r\npower; intimating that they were youths in the flower of their age and\r\nof admirable personal beauty, skilful in the use of every kind of\r\nweapon, well trained in all athletic and military exercises, and\r\nfavourably known for prudence and wisdom. They insinuated also that\r\nGallus himself, being by nature fierce and unmanageable, had been\r\nexcited to acts of additional cruelty and ferocity by persons placed\r\nabout him for that purpose, to the end that, when he had brought upon\r\nhimself universal detestation, the ensigns of power might be transferred\r\nto the children of the master of the horse.\r\n\r\n4. When these and similar suspicions were poured into the ears of\r\nConstantius, which were always open to reports of this kind, the\r\nemperor, revolving different plans in his mind, at last chose the\r\nfollowing as the most advisable course. He commanded Ursicinus in a most\r\ncomplimentary manner to come to him, on the pretence that the urgent\r\nstate of certain affairs required to be arranged by the aid of his\r\ncounsel and concurrence, and that he had need of such additional support\r\nin order to crush the power of the Parthian tribes, who were threatening\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n5. And that he who was thus invited might not suspect anything\r\nunfriendly, the Count Prosper was sent to act as his deputy till he\r\nreturned. Accordingly, when Ursicinus had received the letters, and had\r\nobtained a sufficient supply of carriages, and means of travelling,\r\nwe[17] hastened to Milan with all speed.\r\n\r\n6. The next thing was to contrive to summon the Cæsar, and to induce him\r\nto make the like haste. And to remove all suspicion in his mind,\r\nConstantius used many hypocritical endearments to persuade his own\r\nsister, Gallus's wife, whom he pretended he had long been wishing to\r\nsee, to accompany him. And although she hesitated from fear of her\r\nbrother's habitual cruelty, yet, from a hope that, as he was her\r\nbrother, she might be able to pacify him, she set out; but when she\r\nreached Bithynia, at the station named Cæni Gallici, she was seized with\r\na sudden fever and died. And after her death, her husband, considering\r\nthat he had lost his greatest security and the chief support on which he\r\nrelied, hesitated, taking anxious thought what he should do.\r\n\r\n7. For amid the multiplicity of embarrassing affairs which distracted\r\nhis attention, this point especially filled his mind with apprehension,\r\nthat Constantius, determining everything according to his own sole\r\njudgment, was not a man to admit of any excuse, or to pardon any error;\r\nbut being, as he was, more inclined to severity towards his kinsmen than\r\ntowards others, would be sure to put him to death if he could get him\r\ninto his power.\r\n\r\n8. Being therefore in this critical situation, and feeling that he had\r\nto expect the worst unless he took vigilant care, he embraced the idea\r\nof seizing on the supreme power if he could find any opportunity: but\r\nfor two reasons he distrusted the good faith of his most intimate\r\ncouncillors; both because they dreaded him as at once cruel and fickle,\r\nand also because amid civil dissensions they looked with awe upon the\r\nloftier fortune of Constantius.\r\n\r\n9. While perplexed with these vast and weighty anxieties he received\r\ncontinual letters from the emperor, advising and entreating him to come\r\nto him; and giving him hints that the republic neither could nor ought\r\nto be divided; but that every one was bound to the utmost of his power\r\nto bring aid to it when it was tottering; alluding in this to the\r\ndevastations of the Gauls.\r\n\r\n10. And to this suggestion he added an example of no great antiquity,\r\nthat in the time of Diocletian and his colleague,[18] the Cæsars obeyed\r\nthem as their officers, not remaining stationary, but hastening to\r\nexecute their orders in every direction. And that even Galerius went in\r\nhis purple robe on foot for nearly a mile before the chariot of\r\nAugustus[19] when he was offended with him.\r\n\r\n11. After many other messengers had been despatched to him, Scudilo the\r\ntribune of the Scutarii arrived, a very cunning master of persuasion\r\nunder the cloak of a rude, blunt disposition. He, by mixing flattering\r\nlanguage with his serious conversation, induced him to proceed, when no\r\none else could do so, continually assuring him, with a hypocritical\r\ncountenance, that his cousin was extremely desirous to see him; that,\r\nlike a clement and merciful prince, he would pardon whatever errors had\r\nbeen committed through thoughtlessness; that he would make him a partner\r\nin his own royal rank, and take him for his associate in those toils\r\nwhich the northern provinces, long in a disturbed state, imposed upon\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n12. And as when the Fates lay their hand upon a man his senses are wont\r\nto be blunted and dimmed, so Gallus, being led on by these alluring\r\npersuasions to the expectation of a better fortune, quitted Antioch\r\nunder the guidance of an unfriendly star, and hurried, as the old\r\nproverb has it, out of the smoke into the flame;[20] and having arrived\r\nat Constantinople as if in great prosperity and security, at the\r\ncelebration of the equestrian games, he with his own hand placed the\r\ncrown on the head of the charioteer Corax, when he obtained the victory.\r\n\r\n13. When Constantius heard this he became exasperated beyond all bounds\r\nof moderation; and lest by any chance Gallus, feeling uncertain of the\r\nfuture, should attempt to consult his safety by flight, all the\r\ngarrisons stationed in the towns which lay in his road were carefully\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\n14. And at the same time Taurus, who was sent as quæstor into Armenia,\r\npassed by without visiting or seeing him. Some persons, however, by the\r\ncommand of the emperor, arrived under the pretence of one duty or\r\nanother, in order to take care that he should not be able to move, or\r\nmake any secret attempt of any kind. Among whom was Leontius, afterwards\r\nprefect of the city, who was sent as quæstor; and Lucillianus, as count\r\nof the domestic guards, and a tribune of the Scutarii named Bainobaudes.\r\n\r\n15. Therefore after a long journey through the level country, when he\r\nhad reached Hadrianopolis, a city in the district of Mount Hæmus, which\r\nhad been formerly called Uscudama, where he stayed twelve days to\r\nrecover from his fatigue, he found that the Theban legions, who were in\r\nwinter quarters in the neighbouring towns of those parts, had sent some\r\nof their comrades to exhort him by trustworthy and sure promises to\r\nremain there relying upon them, since they were posted in great force\r\namong the neighbouring stations; but those about him watched him with\r\nsuch diligent care that he could get no opportunity of seeing them, or\r\nof hearing their message.\r\n\r\n16. Then, as letter after letter from the emperor urged him to quit that\r\ncity, he took ten public carriages, as he was desired to do, and leaving\r\nbehind him all his retinue, except a few of his chamberlains and\r\ndomestic officers, whom he had brought with him, he was in this poor\r\nmanner compelled to hasten his journey, his guards forcing him to use\r\nall speed; while he from time to time, with many regrets, bewailed the\r\nrashness which had placed him in a mean and despised condition at the\r\nmercy of men of the lowest class.\r\n\r\n17. And amid all these circumstances, in moments when exhausted nature\r\nsought repose in sleep, his senses were kept in a state of agitation by\r\ndreadful spectres making unseemly noises about him; and crowds of those\r\nwhom he had slain, led on by Domitianus and Montius, seemed to seize and\r\ntorture him with all the torments of the Furies.\r\n\r\n18. For the mind, when freed by sleep from its connection with the body,\r\nis nevertheless active, and being full of the thoughts and anxieties of\r\nmortal pursuits, engenders mighty visions which we call phantoms.\r\n\r\n19. Therefore his melancholy fate, by which it was destined he should be\r\ndeprived of empire and life, leading the way, he proceeded on his\r\njourney by continual relays of horses, till he arrived at Petobio,[21] a\r\ntown in Noricum. Here all disguise was thrown off, and the Count\r\nBarbatio suddenly made his appearance, with Apodemius, the secretary for\r\nthe provinces, and an escort of soldiers whom the emperor had picked out\r\nas men bound to him by especial favours, feeling sure that they could\r\nnot be turned from their obedience either by bribes or pity.\r\n\r\n20. And now the affair was conducted to its conclusion without further\r\ndisguise or deceit, and the whole portion of the palace which is outside\r\nthe walls was surrounded by armed men. Barbatio, entering the palace\r\nbefore daybreak, stripped the Cæsar of his royal robes, and clothed him\r\nwith a tunic and an ordinary soldier's garment, assuring him with many\r\nprotestations, as if by the especial command of the emperor, that he\r\nshould be exposed to no further suffering; and then said to him, \"Stand\r\nup at once.\" And having suddenly placed him in a private carriage, he\r\nconducted him into Istria, near to the town of Pola, where it is\r\nreported that Crispus, the son of Constantine, was formerly put to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n21. And while he was there kept in strict confinement, being already\r\nterrified with apprehensions of his approaching destruction, Eusebius,\r\nat that time the high chamberlain, arrived in haste, and with him\r\nPentadius the secretary, and Mallobaudes the tribune of the guard, who\r\nhad the emperor's orders to compel him to explain, case by case, on what\r\naccounts he had ordered each of the individuals whom he had executed at\r\nAntioch to be put to death.\r\n\r\n22. He being struck with a paleness like that of Adrastus[22] at these\r\nquestions, was only able to reply that he had put most of them to death\r\nat the instigation of his wife Constantina; being forsooth ignorant that\r\nwhen the mother of Alexander the Great urged him to put to death some\r\none who was innocent, and in the hope of prevailing with him, repeated\r\nto him over and over again that she had borne him nine months in her\r\nwomb, and was his mother, that emperor made her this prudent answer, \"My\r\nexcellent mother, ask for some other reward; for the life of a man\r\ncannot be put in the balance with any kind of service.\"\r\n\r\n23. When this was known, the emperor, giving way to unchangeable\r\nindignation and anger, saw that his only hope of establishing security\r\nfirmly lay in putting the Cæsar to death. And having sent Serenianus,\r\nwhom we have already spoken of as having been accused of treason, but\r\nacquitted by intrigue, and Pentadius the secretary, and Apodemius the\r\nsecretary for the provinces, he commanded that they should put him to\r\ndeath. And accordingly his hands were bound like those of some\r\nconvicted thief, and he was beheaded, and his carcass, which but a\r\nlittle while ago had been the object of dread to cities and provinces,\r\ndeprived of head and defaced: it was then left on the ground.\r\n\r\n24. In this the supervision of the supreme Deity manifested itself to be\r\neverywhere vigilant. For not only did the cruelties of Gallus bring\r\nabout his own destruction, but they also who, by their pernicious\r\nflattery and instigation, and charges supported by perjury, had led him\r\nto the perpetration of many murders, not long afterwards died miserably.\r\nScudilo, being afflicted with a liver complaint which penetrated to his\r\nlungs, died vomiting; while Barbatio, who had long busied himself in\r\ninventing false accusations against Gallus, was accused by secret\r\ninformation of aiming at some post higher than his command of infantry,\r\nand being condemned, though unjustly, was put to death, and so by his\r\nmelancholy end made atonement to the shade of the Cæsar.\r\n\r\n25. These, and innumerable other actions of the same kind, Adrastea, who\r\nis also called Nemesis, the avenger of wicked and the rewarder of good\r\ndeeds, is continually bringing to pass: would that she could always do\r\nso! She is a kind of sublime agent of the powerful Deity, dwelling,\r\naccording to common belief, above the human circle; or, as others define\r\nher, she is a substantial protection, presiding over the particular\r\ndestinies of individuals, and feigned by the ancient theologians to be\r\nthe daughter of Justice, looking down from a certain inscrutable\r\neternity upon all terrestrial and mundane affairs.\r\n\r\n26. She, as queen of all causes of events, and arbitress and umpire in\r\nall affairs of life, regulates the urn which contains the lots of men,\r\nand directs the alternations of fortune which we behold in the world,\r\nfrequently bringing our undertakings to an issue different from what we\r\nintended, and involving and changing great numbers of actions. She also,\r\nbinding the vainly swelling pride of mankind by the indissoluble fetters\r\nof necessity, and swaying the inclination of progress and decay\r\naccording to her will, sometimes bows down and enfeebles the stiff neck\r\nof arrogance, and sometimes raises virtuous men from the lowest depth,\r\nleading them to a prosperous and happy life. And it is on this account\r\nthat the fables of antiquity have represented her with wings, that she\r\nmay be supposed to be present at all events with prompt celerity. And\r\nthey have also placed a rudder in her hand and given her a wheel under\r\nher feet, that mankind may be aware that she governs the universe,\r\nrunning at will through all the elements.[23]\r\n\r\n27. In this untimely manner did the Cæsar, being himself also already\r\nweary of life, die, in the twenty-ninth year of his age, having reigned\r\nfour years. He was born in the country of the Etrurians, in the district\r\nof Veternum,[24] being the son of Constantius, the brother of the\r\nEmperor Constantine; his mother was Galla, the sister of Rufinus and\r\nCerealis, men who had been ennobled by the offices of consul and\r\nprefect.\r\n\r\n28. He was a man of splendid stature and great beauty of person and\r\nfigure, with soft hair of a golden colour, his newly sprouting beard\r\ncovering his cheeks with a tender down, and in spite of his youth his\r\ncountenance showed dignity and authority. He differed as much from the\r\ntemperate habits of his brother Julian, as the sons of Vespasian,\r\nDomitian and Titus, differed from each other.\r\n\r\n29. After he had been taken by the emperor as his colleague, and raised\r\nto the highest eminence of power, he experienced the fickle\r\nchangeableness of fortune which mocks mortality, sometimes raising\r\nindividuals to the stars, at others sinking them to the lowest depths\r\nof hell.\r\n\r\n30. And though the examples of such vicissitudes are beyond number,\r\nnevertheless I will only enumerable a few in a cursory manner. This\r\nchangeable and fickle fortune made Agathocles, the Sicilian, a king from\r\nbeing a potter, and reduced Dionysius, formerly the terror of all\r\nnations, to be the master of a grammar school. This same fortune\r\nemboldened Andriscus of Adramyttium, who had been born in a fuller's\r\nshop, to assume the name of Philip, and compelled the legitimate son of\r\nPerseus[25] to descend to the trade of a blacksmith to obtain a\r\nlivelihood. Again, fortune surrendered Mancinus[26] to the people of\r\nNumantia, after he had enjoyed the supreme command, exposed Veturius[27]\r\nto the cruelty of the Samnites, Claudius[28] to that of the Corsicans,\r\nand made Regulus[29] a victim to the ferocity of the Carthaginians.\r\nThrough the injustice of fortune, Pompey,[30] after he had acquired the\r\nsurname of the Great by the grandeur of his exploits, was murdered in\r\nÆgypt at the pleasure of some eunuchs, while a fellow named Eunus, a\r\nslave who had escaped from a house of correction, commanded an army of\r\nrunaway slaves in Sicily. How many men of the highest birth, through the\r\nconnivance of this same fortune, submitted to the authority of Viriathus\r\nand of Spartacus![31] How many heads at which nations once trembled have\r\nfallen under the deadly hand of the executioner! One man is thrown into\r\nprison, another is promoted to unexpected power, a third is hurled down\r\nfrom the highest rank and dignity. But he who would endeavour to\r\nenumerate all the various and frequent instances of the caprice of\r\nfortune, might as well undertake to number the sands or ascertain the\r\nweight of mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Gallus and his brother Julian were the nephews of the great\r\nConstantine, sons of his brother Julius. When Constantius, who succeeded\r\nConstantine on the throne, murdered his uncles and most of his cousins,\r\nhe spared these two, probably on account of their tender age.\r\n\r\n[2] Hannibalianus was another nephew of Constantine. That emperor raised\r\nhis own three sons, Constantine, Constantius, and Constans, to the\r\ndignity of Cæsar; and of his two favourite nephews, Dalmacius and\r\nHannibalianus, he raised the first, by the title of Cæsar, to an\r\nequality with his cousins; \"in favour of the latter he invented the new\r\nand singular appellation of Fortitissimus, to which he annexed the\r\nflattering distinction of a robe of purple and gold. But of the whole\r\nseries of Roman princes in any age of the empire Hannibalianus alone was\r\ndistinguished by the title of _king_, a name which the subjects of\r\nTiberius would have detested as the profane and cruel insult of\r\ncapricious tyranny.\"--Gibbon, cxviii. The editor of Bohn's edition adds\r\nin a note: \"The title given to Hannibalianus did not apply to him as a\r\n_Roman_ prince, but as king of a territory assigned to him in Asia. This\r\nterritory consisted of Pontus, Cappadocia, and the lesser Armenia, the\r\ncity of Cæsarea being chosen for his residence.\"--Gibbon, Bohn's\r\nedition, vol. ii. pp. 256, 257.\r\n\r\n[3] \"There was among the commanders of the soldiery one prefect who was\r\nespecially entitled Præsens, or Præsentalis, because his office was to\r\nbe always in the court or about the person of the prince, and because\r\nthe emperor's body-guard was under his particular orders.\"--H. Valesius.\r\n\r\n[4] The passage is found in Cicero's Oration pro Cluentio, c. 25.\r\n\r\n[5] Sciron was a pirate slain by Theseus, v. Ov. Metam. vii. 44 and the\r\nEpistle of Ariadne to Theseus.\r\n\r\n  \"Cum fuerit Sciron lectus, torvusque Procrustes.\"\r\n\r\n[6] His victory over Magnentius, whom he defeated at Mursa, on the\r\nDoave, in the year 351. Magnentius fled to Aquileia, but was pursued,\r\nand again defeated the next year, at a place called Mons Seleuci, in the\r\nneighbourhood of Gap, and threw himself on his own sword to avoid\r\nfalling into the hands of Constantius.\r\n\r\n[7] Hesiod. Ammianus refers to the passage in Hesiod's Op. et Dies, 289,\r\nbeginning--+tês d' aretês hidrôta theoi proparoithen ethêsan+.\r\n\r\n[8] A nomenclator was a slave who attended a great noble in his walk\r\nthrough the city to remind him of the names of those whom he met. See\r\nCicero pro Muræna, c. 36.\r\n\r\n[9] The name of a slave in the Eunuch, of Terence, who says, act. iv sc.\r\n8--Sannio alone stays at home.\r\n\r\n[10] It was customary on such solemnities, as also on the occasion of\r\nassuming the toga virilis, or entering on any important magistracy, to\r\nmake small presents of money to the guests who were invited to celebrate\r\nthe occasion. Cf. Plin. Epist. x. 117.\r\n\r\n[11] The Latin is Dux. It is about this period that the title Duke and\r\nCount, which we have already had, arose, indicating however at first not\r\nterritorial possessions, but military commands; and it is worth noticing\r\nthat the rank of Count was the higher of the two.\r\n\r\n[12] Constantine, on his conversion to Christianity, had issued an edict\r\nforbidding the consultation of oracles; but the practice was not wholly\r\nabandoned till the time of Theodosius.\r\n\r\n[13] Schools was the name given at Rome to buildings where men were wont\r\nto meet for any purpose, whether of study, of traffic, or of the\r\npractice of any art. The schools of the Palatine were the station of the\r\ncohorts of the guard. The \"Protectors or Guards\" were a body of soldiers\r\nof higher rank, receiving also higher pay; called also \"Domestici or\r\nhousehold troops,\" as especially set apart for the protection of the\r\nimperial palace and person. The \"Scutarii\" (shield-bearers) belonged to\r\nthe Palatine schools; and the Gentiles were troops enlisted from among\r\nthose nations which were still accounted barbarous.\r\n\r\n[14] Gibbon here proposes for le_n_itatem to read le_v_itatem,\r\nfickleness; himself describing Montius as \"a statesman whose art and\r\nexperience were frequently betrayed by the levity of his\r\ndisposition.\"--Cap. xix., p. 298, vol. iii., Bohn's edition.\r\n\r\n[15] Châlons sur Saône.\r\n\r\n[16] Near Basle.\r\n\r\n[17] It will be observed that Ammianus here speaks of himself as in\r\nattendance upon Ursicinus.\r\n\r\n[18] Maximianus Herculius.\r\n\r\n[19] Diocletian.\r\n\r\n[20] As we say, Out of the frying-pan into the fire.\r\n\r\n[21] The town of Pettau, on the Drave.\r\n\r\n[22] A paleness such as overspread the countenance of Adrastus when he\r\nsaw his two sons-in-law, Pydeus and Polynices, slain at Thebes. Virgil\r\nspeaks of Adrasti pallentis imago, Æn. vi. 480.\r\n\r\n[23] Ammianus here confounds Nemesis with Fortuna. Compare Horace's\r\ndescription of the latter goddess, Lib. i. Od. 34:--\r\n\r\n      \" ... Valet ima summis\r\n  Mutare, et insignia attenuat deus\r\n  Obscura promens: hinc apicem rapax\r\n      Fortuna cum stridore acuto\r\n      Sustulit; hic posuisse gaudet.\"\r\n\r\nOr, as it is translated by Dr. Francis:--\r\n\r\n  \"The hand of Jove can crush the proud\r\n  Down to the meanness of the crowd:\r\n      And raise the lowest in his stead:\r\n  But rapid Fortune pulls him down,\r\n  And snatches his imperial crown,\r\n      To place, not _fix_ it, on another's head.\"\r\n\r\n[24] Near the modern city of Sienna.\r\n\r\n[25] See Plutarch's Life of Æmilius, c. 37. The name of the young prince\r\nwas Alexander.\r\n\r\n[26] Called also Hostilius; cf. Vell. Paterc. ii. 1.\r\n\r\n[27] Cf. Liv. ix. c. x.; Cicero de Officiis, iii. 30.\r\n\r\n[28] Cf. Val. Max. vi. 3.\r\n\r\n[29] Cf. Horace, Od. iv. ult.; Florus, ii. 1. The story of the cruelties\r\ninflicted on Regulus is now, however, generally disbelieved.\r\n\r\n[30] The fate of Pompey served also as an instance to Juvenal in his\r\nsatire on the vanity of human wishes.\r\n\r\n  Provida Pompeio diderat Campania febres\r\n  Optandas, sed multæ urbes et publica vota\r\n  Vicerunt; igitur Fortuna ipsius et urbis\r\n  Servatum victo caput abstulit.\r\n\r\nSat.

Having investigated the truth to the best of our power we have\r\nhitherto related all the transactions which either our age permitted us\r\nto witness, or which we could learn from careful examination of those\r\nwho were concerned in them, in the order in which the several events\r\ntook place. The remaining facts, which the succeeding books will set\r\nforth, we will, as far as our talent permits, explain with the greatest\r\naccuracy, without fearing those who may be inclined to cavil at our work\r\nas too long; for brevity is only to be praised when, while it puts an\r\nend to unseasonable delays, it suppresses nothing which is well\r\nauthenticated.\r\n\r\n2. Gallus had hardly breathed his last in Noricum, when Apodemius, who\r\nas long as he lived had been a fiery instigator of disturbances, caught\r\nup his shoes and carried them off, journeying, with frequent relays of\r\nhorses, so rapidly as even to kill some of them by excess of speed, and\r\nso brought the first news of what had occurred to Milan. And having made\r\nhis way into the palace, he threw down the shoes before the feet of\r\nConstantius, as if he were bringing the spoils of a king of the\r\nParthians who had been slain. And when this sudden news arrived that an\r\naffair so unexpected and difficult had been executed with entire\r\nfacility in complete accordance with the wish of the emperor, the\r\nprincipal courtiers, according to their custom, exerting all their zeal\r\nin the path of flattery, extolled to the skies the virtue and good\r\nfortune of the emperor, at whose nod, as if they had been mere common\r\nsoldiers, two princes had thus been deprived of their power, namely,\r\nVeteranio and Gallus.\r\n\r\n3. And Constantius being exceedingly elated at the exquisite taste of\r\nthis adulation, and thinking that he himself for the future should be\r\nfree from all the ordinary inconveniences of mortality, now began to\r\ndepart from the path of justice so evidently that he even at times laid\r\nclaim to immortality; and in writing letters with his own hand, would\r\nstyle himself lord of the whole world; a thing which, if others had\r\nsaid, any one ought to have been indignant at, who laboured with proper\r\ndiligence to form his life and habits in emulation of the constitutional\r\nprinces who had preceded him, as he professed to do.\r\n\r\n4. For even if he had under his power the infinities of worlds fancied\r\nby Democritus, as Alexander the Great, under the promptings of\r\nAnaxarchus, did fancy, yet either by reading, or by hearing others\r\nspeak, he might have considered that (as mathematicians unanimously\r\nagree) the circumference of the whole earth, immense as it seems to us,\r\nis nevertheless not bigger than a pin's point as compared with the\r\ngreatness of the universe.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. And now, after the pitiable death of the Cæsar, the trumpet of\r\njudicial dangers sounded the alarm, and Ursicinus was impeached of\r\ntreason, envy gaining more and more strength every day to attack his\r\nsafety; envy which is inimical to all powerful men.\r\n\r\n2. For he was overcome by this difficulty, that, while the ears of the\r\nemperor were shut against all defences which were reasonable and easy of\r\nproof, they were open to all the secret whispers of calumniators, who\r\npretended that his name was almost disused among all the districts of\r\nthe East, and that Ursicinus was urged by them both privately and\r\npublicly to be their commander, as one who could be formidable to the\r\nPersian nation.\r\n\r\n3. But this magnanimous man stood his ground immovably against whatever\r\nmight happen, only taking care not to throw himself away in an abject\r\nmanner, and grieving from his heart that innocence had no safe\r\nfoundation on which to stand. And the more sad also for this\r\nconsideration, that before these events took place many of his friends\r\nhad gone over to other more powerful persons, as in cases of official\r\ndignity the lictors go over to the successors of former officers.\r\n\r\n4. His colleague Arbetio was attacking him by cajoling words of feigned\r\ngood-will, often publicly speaking of him as a virtuous and brave man;\r\nArbetio being a man of great cunning in laying snares for men of simple\r\nlife, and one who at that season enjoyed too much power. For as a\r\nserpent that has its hole underground and hidden from the sight of man\r\nobserves the different passers-by, and attacks whom it will with a\r\nsudden spring, so this man, having been raised from being a common\r\nsoldier of the lowest class to the highest military dignities, without\r\nhaving received any injury or any provocation, polluted his conscience\r\nfrom an insatiable desire of doing mischief.\r\n\r\n5. Therefore, having a few partners in his secrets for accomplices, he\r\nhad secretly arranged with the emperor when he asked his opinion, that\r\non the next night Ursicinus should be seized and carried away from the\r\nsight of the soldiers, and so be put to death uncondemned, just as\r\nformerly Domitius Corbulo, that faithful and wise defender of our\r\nprovinces, is said to have been slain in the miserable period of Nero's\r\ncruelty.\r\n\r\n6. And after the matter had been thus arranged, while the men destined\r\nfor the service of seizing Ursicinus were waiting for the appointed\r\ntime, the emperor's mind changed to mercy, and so this impious deed was\r\nput off for further consideration.\r\n\r\n7. Then the engine of calumny was directed against Julian, who had\r\nlately been brought to court; a prince who afterwards became memorable,\r\nbut who was now attacked with a twofold accusation, as the iniquity of\r\nhis enemies thought requisite. First, that he had gone from the Park of\r\nMacellum, which lies in Cappadocia, into Asia, from a desire of\r\nacquiring polite learning. Secondly, that he had seen his brother as he\r\npassed through Constantinople.\r\n\r\n8. And when he had explained away the charges thus brought against him,\r\nand had proved that he had not done either of these things without being\r\nordered, he would still have perished through the intrigues of the\r\nabandoned court of flatterers, if he had not been saved by the favour of\r\nthe supreme Deity, with the assistance of Queen Eusebia. By her\r\nintercession he obtained leave to be conducted to the town of Como, in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Milan; and after he had remained there a short time\r\nhe was permitted to go to Greece for the purpose of cultivating his\r\nliterary tastes, as he was very eager to do.\r\n\r\n9. Nor were there wanting other incidents arising out of these\r\noccurrences, which might be looked upon as events under the direction of\r\nProvidence, as some of them were rightly punished, while others failed\r\nof their design, proving vain and ineffective. But it occasionally\r\nhappened that rich men, relying on the protection of those in office,\r\nand clinging to them as the ivy clings to lofty trees, bought acquittals\r\nat immense prices; and that poor men who had little or no means of\r\npurchasing safety were condemned out of hand. And therefore truth was\r\novershadowed by falsehood, and sometimes falsehood obtained the\r\nauthority of truth.\r\n\r\n10. In these days Gorgonius also was summoned to court, the man who had\r\nbeen the Cæsar's principal chamberlain. And though it was made plain by\r\nhis own confession that he had been a partner in his undertakings, and\r\nsometimes a chief instigator of them, yet through the conspiracy of the\r\neunuchs justice was overpowered by dexterously arranged falsehoods, and\r\nhe was acquitted and so escaped the danger.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. While these events were taking place at Milan, battalions of\r\nsoldiers were brought from the East to Aquileia, with a number of\r\nmembers of the court, who, being broken in spirit, while their limbs\r\nwere enfeebled by the weight of their chains, cursed the protraction of\r\ntheir lives which were surrounded with every variety of misery. For they\r\nwere accused of having been the ministers of the ferocity of Gallus, and\r\nit was believed to be owing to them that Domitian had been torn to\r\npieces, and that Montius and others had been brought to destruction.\r\n\r\n2. Arboreus, and Eusebius, at that time high chamberlain, both men of\r\ninsane arrogance, and equally unjust and cruel, were appointed to try\r\nthese men. And they, without any careful examination, or making any\r\ndistinction between the innocent and the guilty, condemned some to\r\nscourgings, others to torture and exile, some they adjudged to serve in\r\nthe lowest ranks of the army, and the rest they condemned to death. And\r\nwhen they had thus filled the sepulchres with dead bodies, they returned\r\nas if in triumph, and brought an account of their exploits to the\r\nemperor, who was notoriously severe and implacable against all offences\r\nof the kind.\r\n\r\n3. After this, throughout the rest of his reign, Constantius, as if\r\nresolved to reverse the prescribed arrangement of the Fates, behaved\r\nwith greater violence than ever, and opened his heart to numbers of\r\ndesigning plotters. And owing to this conduct, many men arose who\r\nwatched for all kinds of reports, at first attacking, as with the\r\nappetite of wild beasts, those in the enjoyment of the highest honours\r\nand rank, and afterwards both poor and rich indiscriminately. Not like\r\nthose Cibyratæ in the time of Verres,[32] fawning on the tribunal of a\r\nsingle lieutenant, but harassing the limbs of the whole republic by\r\nmeans of all the evils that arose anywhere.\r\n\r\n4. Among these men Paulus and Mercurius were especially conspicuous, the\r\nfirst a Dacian born, the latter a Persian. Mercurius was a notary, and\r\nPaulus had been promoted from being a steward of the emperor's table to\r\na receivership in the provinces. Paulus, as I have already mentioned,\r\nhad been nicknamed The Chain, because in weaving knots of calumnies he\r\nwas invincible, scattering around foul poisons and destroying people by\r\nvarious means, as some skilful wrestlers are wont in their contests to\r\ncatch hold of their antagonists by the heel.\r\n\r\n5. Mercurius was nicknamed Count of Dreams, because (as a dog fond of\r\nbiting secretly fawns and wags his tail while full of inward spite) he\r\nforced his way into feasts and companies, and if any one in his sleep\r\n(when nature roves about with an extraordinary degree of freedom)\r\ncommunicated to a friend that he had seen anything, exaggerated it,\r\ncolouring it for the most part with envenomed arts, and bore it to the\r\nopen ears of the emperor. And for such speeches men were attacked with\r\nformidable accusations, as if they had committed inexpiable crimes.\r\n\r\n6. The news of these events having got abroad, men were so cautious of\r\neven relating nocturnal dreams, that, in the presence of a stranger,\r\nthey would scarcely confess they had slept at all. And some accomplished\r\nmen lamented that they had not been born in the country of Mount\r\nAtlas,[33] where it is said that dreams never occur, though what the\r\ncause of such a fact is, we must leave to those who are learned in such\r\nmatters to decide.\r\n\r\n7. Amid all these terrible investigations and punishments, another\r\ndisaster took place in Illyricum, which from some empty words involved\r\nmany in danger. At an entertainment given by Africanus, the governor of\r\nthe second Pannonia, at Sirmium, some men having drunk rather too much,\r\nand thinking there was no witness of their proceedings, spoke freely of\r\nthe existing imperial government, accusing it as most vexatious to the\r\npeople. And some of them expressed a hope that a change, such as was\r\nwished for by all, might be at hand, affirming that this was portended\r\nby omens, while some, with incredible rashness, affirmed that the\r\nauguries of their ancestral house promised the same thing.\r\n\r\n8. Among those present at the banquet was Gaudentius, one of the\r\nsecretaries, a stupid man, and of a hasty disposition. And he looking\r\nupon the matter as serious, reported it to Rufinus, who was at that time\r\nthe chief commander of the guard of the prætorian prefecture, a man\r\nalways eager for the most cruel measures, and infamous for every kind of\r\nwickedness.\r\n\r\n9. He immediately, as if borne on wings, flew to the court of the\r\nemperor, and so bitterly inflamed him, always easy of access and\r\nsusceptible of impressions from suspicious circumstances of this kind,\r\nthat without a moment's deliberation he ordered Africanus and all who\r\nhad been partakers of his fatal banquet to be seized. And when this was\r\ndone, the wicked informer, always fond of whatever is contrary to\r\npopular manners, obtained what he most coveted, a continuation of his\r\nexisting office for two years.\r\n\r\n10. To arrest these men, Teutomeres, the chief of the Protectores, was\r\nsent with his colleague; and he loaded them all with chains, and\r\nconducted them, as he had been ordered, to the emperor's court. But when\r\nthey arrived at Aquileia, Marinus, who from having been a drillmaster\r\nhad been promoted to a tribuneship, but who at that time had had no\r\nparticular duty, being a man who had held dangerous language, and who\r\nwas in other respects of an intemperate disposition, being left in an\r\ninn while things necessary for the journey were being prepared, stabbed\r\nhimself with a knife which he accidentally found, and his bowels gushed\r\nout, so that he died. The rest were conducted to Milan, and subjected to\r\ntorture; and having been forced by their agony to confess that while at\r\nthe banquet they had used some petulant expressions, were ordered to be\r\nkept in penal confinement, with some hope, though an uncertain one, of\r\neventual release. But Teutomeres and his colleague, being accused of\r\nhaving allowed Marinus to kill himself, were condemned to banishment,\r\nthough they were afterwards pardoned through the intercession of\r\nArbetio.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n§ 1. Soon after this transaction had been thus terminated, war was\r\ndeclared against the tribes of the Allemanni around Lentia,[34] who had\r\noften made extensive incursions into the contiguous Roman territories.\r\nThe emperor himself set out on the expedition, and went as far as\r\nRhætia, and the district of the Canini.[35] And there, after long and\r\ncareful deliberation, it was decided to be both honourable and expedient\r\nthat Arbetio, the master of the horse, should march with a division of\r\nthe troops, in fact with the greater part of the army, along the borders\r\nof the lake of Brigantia, with the object of coming to an immediate\r\nengagement with the barbarians. And I will here describe the character\r\nof the ground briefly, as well as I can.\r\n\r\n2. The Rhine rising among the defiles of lofty mountains, and forcing\r\nits way with immense violence through steep rocks, stretches its onward\r\ncourse without receiving any foreign waters, in the same manner as the\r\nNile pours down with headlong descent through the cataracts. And it is\r\nso abundantly full by its own natural riches that it would be navigable\r\nup to its very source were it not like a torrent rather than a stream.\r\n\r\n3. And soon after it has disentangled itself from its defiles, rolling\r\nonward between high banks, it enters a vast lake of circular form, which\r\nthe Rhætian natives call Brigantia,[36] being four hundred and sixty\r\nfurlongs in length, and of nearly equal extent in breadth,\r\nunapproachable on account of a vast mass of dark woods, except where the\r\nenergy of the Romans has made a wide road through them, in spite of the\r\nhostility of the barbarians, and the unfavourable character both of the\r\nground and the climate.\r\n\r\n4. The Rhine forcing its way into this pool, and roaring with its\r\nfoaming eddies, pierces the sluggish quiet of the waters, and rushes\r\nthrough the middle from one end to the other. And like an element\r\nseparated from some other element by eternal discord, without any\r\nincrease or diminution of the volume of water which it has brought into\r\nthe lake, it comes forth from it again with its old name and its\r\nunalloyed power, never having suffered from the contact, and so proceeds\r\ntill it mingles with the waves of the sea.\r\n\r\n5. And what is exceedingly strange, the lake is not moved at all by this\r\nrapid passage of the river through it, nor is it affected by the muddy\r\nsoil beneath the waters of the lake; the two bodies of water being\r\nincapable of mingling with each other. A thing which would be supposed\r\nimpossible, did not the very sight of the lake prove the fact.\r\n\r\n6. In a similar manner, the Alpheus, rising in Arcadia, being seized\r\nwith a love for the fountain Arethusa,[37] passing through the Ionian\r\nsea, as is related by the poets, proceeds onward till it arrives at the\r\nneighbourhood of its beloved fountain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n7. Arbetio not choosing to wait till messengers arrived to announce the\r\napproach of the barbarians, although he knew the fierce way in which\r\nthey begin their wars, allowed himself to be betrayed into a hidden\r\nambush, where he stood without the power of moving, being bewildered by\r\nthe suddenness of his disaster.\r\n\r\n8. In the mean time the enemy, showing themselves, sprang forth from\r\ntheir hiding-places and spared not one who came in their way, but\r\noverwhelmed them with every kind of weapon. For none of our men could\r\noffer the smallest resistance, nor was there any hope of any of them\r\nbeing able to save their lives except by a speedy flight. Therefore,\r\nbeing intent only on avoiding wounds, our soldiers, losing all order,\r\nran almost at random in every direction, exposing their backs to the\r\nblows of the enemy. Nevertheless the greater part of them, scattering\r\nthemselves among narrow paths, were saved from danger by the protecting\r\ndarkness of the night, and at the return of day recovered their courage\r\nand rejoined their different legions. But still by this sad and\r\nunexpected disaster a vast number of common soldiers and ten tribunes\r\nwere slain.\r\n\r\n9. The Allemanni were greatly elated at this event, and advanced with\r\nincreased boldness, every day coming up to the fortifications of the\r\nRomans while the morning mists obscured the light; and drawing their\r\nswords roamed about in every direction, gnashing their teeth, and\r\nthreatening us with haughty shouts. Then with a sudden sally our\r\nScutarii would rush forth, and after being stopped for a moment by the\r\nresistance of the hostile squadrons, would call out all their comrades\r\nto join them in the engagement.\r\n\r\n10. But the greater part of our men were alarmed by the recollection of\r\ntheir recent disaster, and Arbetio hesitated, thinking everything\r\npregnant with danger. Upon this three tribunes at once sallied forth,\r\nArintheus who was a lieutenant commander of the heavy troops, Seniauchus\r\nwho commanded the cavalry of the Comites,[38] and Bappo who had the\r\ncommand of the Promoti[39] and of those troops who had been particularly\r\nintrusted to his charge by the emperor.\r\n\r\n11. These men, looking on the common cause as their own, resolved to\r\nrepel the violence of the enemy according to the example of their\r\nancient comrades. And pouring down upon the foe like a torrent, not in a\r\nregular line of battle, but in desultory attacks like those of banditti,\r\nthey put them all to flight in a disgraceful manner. Since they, being\r\nin loose order and straggling, and hampered by their endeavours to\r\nescape, exposed their unprotected bodies to our weapons, and were slain\r\nby repeated blows of sword and spear.\r\n\r\n12. Many too were slain with their horses, and seemed as they lay on\r\ntheir backs to be so entangled as still to be sitting on them. And when\r\nthis was seen, all our men who had previously hesitated to engage in\r\nbattle with their comrades, poured forth out of the camp; and now,\r\nforgetful of all precautions, they drove before them the mob of\r\nbarbarians, except such as flight had saved from destruction, trampling\r\non the heaps of slain, and covered with gore.\r\n\r\n13. When the battle was thus terminated the emperor in triumph and joy\r\nreturned to Milan to winter quarters.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nA.D. 355.\r\n\r\n§ 1. After these unhappy circumstances, accompanied as they were with\r\nequal calamities in the provinces, a whirlwind of new misfortunes arose\r\nwhich seemed likely to destroy the whole state at once, if Fortune,\r\nwhich regulates the events of human life, had not terminated a state of\r\naffairs which all regarded with great apprehension, by bringing the\r\ndangers to a speedy issue.\r\n\r\n2. From the long neglect with which these provinces had been treated,\r\nthe Gauls, having no assistance on which to rely, had borne cruel\r\nmassacres, with plunder and conflagration, from barbarians who raged\r\nthroughout their land with impunity. Silvanus, the commander of the\r\ninfantry, being a man well suited to correct these evils, went thither\r\nat the command of the emperor, Arbetio at the same time urging with all\r\nhis power that this task should be undertaken without delay, with the\r\nobject of imposing the dangerous burden of this duty on his absent\r\nrival, whom he was vexed to see still in prosperity....\r\n\r\n3. There was a certain man named Dynamius, the superintendent of the\r\nemperor's beasts of burden, who had begged of Silvanus recommendatory\r\nletters to his friends as of one who was admitted to his most intimate\r\nfriendship. Having obtained this favour, as Silvanus, having no\r\nsuspicion of any evil intention, had with great simplicity granted what\r\nhe was asked, Dynamius kept the letters, in order at a future time to\r\nplan something to his injury.\r\n\r\n4. Therefore, when the aforesaid commander had gone to the Gauls in the\r\nservice of the republic, and while he was engaged in repelling the\r\nbarbarians, who already began to distrust their own power, and to be\r\nfilled with alarm, Dynamius, being restless, like a man of cunning and\r\npractised deceitfulness, devised a wicked plot; and in this it is said\r\nhe had for his accomplices Lampadius, the prefect of the prætorian\r\nguard, Eusebius, who had been the superintendent of the emperor's privy\r\npurse, and was known by the nickname of Mattyocopa,[40] and Ædesius,\r\nformerly keeper of the records, whom this prefect had contrived to have\r\nelected consul, as being his dearest friend. He then with a sponge\r\neffaced the contents of the letters, leaving nothing but the address,\r\nand inserted a text materially differing from the original writing, as\r\nif Silvanus had asked, by indirect hints, and entreated his friends who\r\nwere within the palace, and those who had no office (among whom was\r\nAlbinus of Etruria, and many others), to aid him in projects of loftier\r\nambition, as one who would soon attain the imperial throne. This bundle\r\nof letters he thus made up, inventing at his leisure, in order with them\r\nto endanger the life of this innocent man.\r\n\r\n5. Dynamius was appointed to investigate these charges on behalf of the\r\nemperor; and while he was artfully weaving these and similar plans, he\r\ncontrived to enter alone into the imperial chamber, choosing his\r\nopportunity, and hoping to entangle firmly in his meshes the most\r\nvigilant guardian of the emperor's safety. And being full of wicked\r\ncunning, after he had read the forged packet of letters in the council\r\nchamber, the tribunes were ordered to be committed to custody, and also\r\nseveral private individuals were commanded to be arrested and brought up\r\nfrom the provinces, whose names were mentioned in those letters.\r\n\r\n6. But presently Malarichus, the commander of the Gentiles, being struck\r\nwith the iniquity of the business, and taking his colleagues to his\r\ncounsel, spoke out loudly that men devoted to the preservation of the\r\nemperor ought not to be circumvented by factions and treachery. He\r\naccordingly demanded that he himself, his nearest relations being left\r\nas hostages, and Mallobaudes, the tribune of the heavy-armed soldiers,\r\ngiving bail that he would return, might be commissioned to go with speed\r\nto bring back Silvanus, who he was certain had never entertained the\r\nidea of any such attempt as these bitter plotters had imputed to him.\r\nOr, as an alternative, he entreated that he might become security for\r\nMallobaudes, and that their officers might be permitted to go and do\r\nwhat he had proposed to take upon himself.\r\n\r\n7. For he affirmed that he knew beyond all question that, if any\r\nstranger were sent, Silvanus, who was inclined to be somewhat\r\napprehensive of danger, even when no circumstances were really\r\ncalculated to alarm him, would very likely throw matters into confusion.\r\n\r\n8. But, although the advice which he gave was useful and necessary, he\r\nspoke as to the winds, to no purpose. For by the counsels of Arbetio,\r\nApodemius, who was a persevering and bitter enemy to all good men, was\r\nsent with letters to summon Silvanus to the presence. When he had\r\narrived in Gaul, taking no heed of the commission with which he was\r\ncharged, and caring but little for anything that might happen, he\r\nremained inactive, without either seeing Silvanus, or delivering the\r\nletters which commanded him to appear at court. And having taken the\r\nreceiver of the province into his counsels, he began with arrogance and\r\nmalevolence to harass the clients and servants of the master of the\r\nhorse, as if that officer had been already condemned and was on the\r\npoint of being executed.\r\n\r\n9. In the mean time, while the arrival of Silvanus was looked for, and\r\nwhile Apodemius was throwing everything, though quiet before, into\r\ncommotion, Dynamius, that he might by still more convincing proofs\r\nestablish belief in his wicked plots, had sent other forged letters\r\n(agreeing with the previous ones which he had brought under the\r\nemperor's notice by the agency of the prefect) to the tribune of the\r\nfactory at Cremona: these were written in the names of Silvanus and\r\nMalarichus, in which the tribune, as one privy to their secrets, was\r\nwarned to lose no time in having everything in readiness.\r\n\r\n10. But when this tribune had read the whole of the letters, he was for\r\nsome time in doubt and perplexity as to what they could mean (for he did\r\nnot recollect that those persons whose letters he had thus received had\r\never spoken with him upon private transactions of any kind); and\r\naccordingly he sent the letters themselves, by the courier who had\r\nbrought them, to Malarichus, sending a soldier also with him; and\r\nentreated Malarichus to explain in intelligible language what he wanted,\r\nand not to use such obscure terms. For he declared that he, being but a\r\nplain and somewhat rude man, had not in the least understood what was\r\nintimated so obscurely.\r\n\r\n11. Malarichus the moment he received the letters, being already in\r\nsorrow and anxiety, and alarmed for his own fate and that of his\r\ncountryman Silvanus, called around him the Franks, of whom at that time\r\nthere was a great multitude in the palace, and in resolute language laid\r\nopen and proved the falsehood of the machinations by which their lives\r\nwere threatened, and was loud in his complaints.\r\n\r\n12. When these things became known to the emperor, he appointed the\r\nmembers of his secret council and the chief officers of his army to make\r\nfurther investigation of the matter. And when the judges appeared to\r\nmake light of it, Florentius the son of Nigridianus, who at that time\r\nfilled the post of master of the offices,[41] having examined the\r\nwritings carefully, and detecting beneath them some vestiges of the tops\r\nof the former words which had been effaced, perceived, as was indeed the\r\ncase, that by interpolations of the original letter, matters very\r\ndifferent from any of which Silvanus was author had been written over\r\nthem, according to the fancy of the contriver of this forgery.\r\n\r\n13. On this the cloud of treachery was dispersed, and the emperor,\r\ninformed of the truth by a faithful report, recalled the powers granted\r\nto the prefect, and ordered him to be submitted to an examination.\r\nNevertheless he was acquitted through the active combination of many of\r\nhis friends; while Eusebius, the former treasurer of the emperor's\r\nsecret purse, being put to the torture, confessed that these things had\r\nbeen done with his privity.\r\n\r\n14. Ædesius, affirming with obstinate denial that he had never known\r\nanything which had been done in the matter, escaped, being adjudged\r\ninnocent. And thus the transaction was brought to an end, and all those\r\nwho had been accused in the original information were acquitted; and\r\nDynamius, as a man of exceeding accomplishments and prudence, was\r\nappointed to govern Etruria with the rank of corrector.\r\n\r\n15. While these affairs were proceeding, Silvanus was living at\r\nAgrippina,[42] and having learnt by continual information sent to him\r\nby his friends what Apodemius was doing with the hope of effecting his\r\nruin; and knowing also how impressible the mind of the feeble emperor\r\nwas; began to fear lest in his absence, and without being convicted of\r\nany crime, he might still be treated as a criminal. And so, being placed\r\nin a situation of the greatest difficulty, he began to think of trusting\r\nhimself to the good faith of the barbarians.\r\n\r\n16. But being dissuaded from this by Laniogaisus, at that time a\r\ntribune, whom we have already spoken of as the only person who was\r\npresent with Constans when he was dying, himself serving at that time as\r\na volunteer; and being assured by Laniogaisus that the Franks, of whom\r\nhe himself was a countryman, would put him to death, or else betray him\r\nfor a bribe, he saw no safety anywhere in the present emergency, and so\r\nwas driven to extreme counsels. And by degrees, having secretly\r\nconferred with the chiefs of the principal legions, and having excited\r\nthem by the magnitude of promised rewards, he tore for use on this\r\noccasion the purple silk from the insignia of the dragons[43] and\r\nstandards, and so assumed the title of emperor.\r\n\r\n17. And while these events are passing in Gaul, one day, a little before\r\nsunset, an unexpected messenger arrived at Milan, relating fully that\r\nSilvanus, being ambitious to rise above his place as commander of the\r\ninfantry, had tampered with the army, and assumed the imperial dignity.\r\n\r\n18. Constantius, at this amazing and unexpected event, seemed as if\r\nstruck by a thunderbolt of fate, and having at once summoned a council\r\nto meet at the second watch, all the nobles hastened to the palace. No\r\none had either mind to conceive or tongue to recommend what was best to\r\nbe done; but in suppressed tones they mentioned the name of Ursicinus as\r\na man eminent for skill in affairs of war, and one who had been\r\nundeservedly exposed to most injurious treatment. He was immediately\r\nsent for by the principal chamberlain, which is the most honourable kind\r\nof summons, and as soon as he entered the council-chamber was offered\r\nthe purple to salute much more graciously than at any former time.\r\nDiocletian was the first who introduced the custom of offering reverence\r\nto the emperor after this foreign manner and royal pretension; whereas\r\nall former princes, as we read, had been saluted like judges.\r\n\r\n19. And so the man who a little while before, through the malevolent\r\npersecution of certain of the courtiers, had been termed the whirlpool\r\nof the East, and who had been accused of a design to aim at the supreme\r\npower for his sons, was now recommended as one who was a most skilful\r\ngeneral, who had been the comrade of the great Constantine, and as the\r\nonly man capable of extinguishing the threatened conflagration. And\r\nthough the reasons for which he was sent for were honest, they were not\r\nwholly free from underhand motives. For while great anxiety was felt\r\nthat Silvanus should be destroyed as a most formidable rebel, yet, if\r\nthat object miscarried, it was thought that Ursicinus, being damaged by\r\nthe failure, would himself easily be ruined; so that no scruple, which\r\nelse was to be feared, would interpose to save him from destruction.\r\n\r\n20. While arrangements were being made for accelerating his journey, the\r\ngeneral was preparing to repel the charges which had been brought\r\nagainst him; but the emperor prevented him, forbidding him in\r\nconciliatory language, saying that this was not an opportunity suitable\r\nfor undertaking any controversy in defence of his cause, when the\r\nimminent necessity of affairs rather prompted that no delay should be\r\ninterposed to the restoration of parties to their pristine concord\r\nbefore the disunion got worse.\r\n\r\n21. Therefore, after a long deliberation about many things, the first\r\nand most important matter in which consultation was held, was by what\r\nmeans Silvanus could be led to think the emperor still ignorant of his\r\nconduct. And the most likely manner to confirm him in his confidence\r\nappeared to be that he should be informed, in a complimentary despatch,\r\nthat Ursicinus was appointed his successor, and that he was invited to\r\nreturn to court with undiminished power.\r\n\r\n22. After this affair was arranged, the officer who had brought the news\r\nto Milan was ordered to depart with some tribunes and ten of the\r\nProtectores and domestic guard as an escort, given to him at his own\r\nrequest, to aid him in the discharge of his public duty. And of these I\r\nmyself was one, with my colleague Verrinianus; and all the rest were\r\neither friends or relations of mine.\r\n\r\n23. And now all of us, fearing mainly for ourselves, accompanied him a\r\nlong distance on his journey; and although we seemed as exposed to\r\ndanger as gladiators about to fight with wild beasts, yet considering in\r\nour minds that evils are often the forerunners of good, we recollected\r\nwith admiration that expression of Cicero's, uttered by him in\r\naccordance with the eternal maxims of truth, which runs in these\r\nwords:[44]--\"And although it is a thing most desirable that one's\r\nfortune should always continue in a most flourishing condition; still\r\nthat general level state of life brings not so much sensation of joy as\r\nwe feel when, after having been surrounded by disasters or by dangers,\r\nfortune returns into a happier condition.\"\r\n\r\n24. Accordingly we hastened onwards by forced journeys, in order that\r\nthe master of the horse, who was eager to acquire the honour of\r\nsuppressing the revolt, might make his appearance in the suspected\r\ndistrict before any rumour of the usurpation of Silvanus had spread\r\namong the Italians. But rapidly as we hastened, fame, like the wind, had\r\noutstripped us, and had revealed some part of the facts; and when we\r\nreached Agrippina we found matters quite out of the reach of our\r\nattempts.\r\n\r\n25. For a vast multitude of people, assembled from all quarters, were,\r\nwith a mixture of haste and alarm, strengthening the foundations of\r\nSilvanus's enterprise, and a numerous military force was collected; so\r\nthat it seemed more advisable, on the existing emergency, for our\r\nunfortunate general to await the intentions and pleasure of the new\r\nemperor, who was assuring himself by ridiculous omens and signs that he\r\nwas gaining accessions of strength. By permitting his feelings of\r\nsecurity to increase, by different pretences of agreement and flattery,\r\nSilvanus, it was thought, might be relieved from all fear of hostility,\r\nand so be the more easily deceived.\r\n\r\n26. But the accomplishment of such a design appeared difficult. For it\r\nwas necessary to use great care and watchfulness to make our desires\r\nsubordinate to our opportunities, and to prevent their either outrunning\r\nthem, or falling behind them; since if our wishes were allowed to become\r\nknown unseasonably, it was plain we should all be involved in one\r\nsentence of death.\r\n\r\n27. However our general was kindly received, and (the very business\r\nitself forcing us to bend our necks), having been compelled to prostrate\r\nhimself with all solemnity before the newly robed prince, still aiming\r\nat higher power, was treated as a highly favoured and eminent friend;\r\nhaving freedom of access and the honour of a seat at the royal table\r\ngranted to him in preference to every one else, in order that he might\r\nbe consulted with the more secrecy about the principal affairs of state.\r\n\r\n28. Silvanus expressed his indignation that, while unworthy persons had\r\nbeen raised to the consulship and to other high dignities, he and\r\nUrsicinus alone, after the frequent and great toils which they had\r\nendured for the sake of the republic, had been so despised that he\r\nhimself had been accused of treason in consequence of the examination of\r\nsome slaves, and had been exposed to an ignoble trial; while Ursicinus\r\nhad been brought over from the East, and placed at the mercy of his\r\nenemies; and these were the subjects of his incessant complaints both in\r\npublic and in private.\r\n\r\n29. While, however, he was holding this kind of language, we were\r\nalarmed at the murmurs of our soldiers who were now suffering from want,\r\nwhich surrounded us on all sides; the troops showing every eagerness to\r\nmake a rapid march, through the defiles of the Cottian Alps.\r\n\r\n30. In this state of anxiety and agitation, we occupied ourselves in\r\nsecretly deliberating on the means of arriving at our object; and at\r\nlength, after our plans had been repeatedly changed out of fear, it was\r\ndetermined to use great industry in seeking out prudent agents, binding\r\nthem to secrecy by solemn oaths, in order to tamper with the Gallic\r\nsoldiers whom we knew to be men of doubtful fidelity, and at any time\r\nopen to change for a sufficient reward.\r\n\r\n31. Therefore, after we had secured our success by the address of some\r\nagents among the common soldiers, men by their very obscurity fitted for\r\nthe accomplishment of such a task, and now excited by the expectation of\r\nreward, at sunrise, as soon as the east began to redden, a band of armed\r\nmen suddenly sallied forth, and, as is common in critical moments,\r\nbehaving with more than usual audacity. They slew the sentinels and\r\npenetrated into the palace, and so having dragged Silvanus out of a\r\nlittle chapel in which, in his terror, he had taken refuge on his way to\r\na conventicle devoted to the ceremonies of the Christian worship, they\r\nslew him with repeated strokes of their swords.\r\n\r\n32. In this way did a general of no slight merit perish, through fear of\r\nfalse accusations heaped on him in his absence by a faction of wicked\r\nmen, and which drove him to the utmost extremities in order to preserve\r\nhis safety.\r\n\r\n33. For although he had acquired strong claims on the gratitude of\r\nConstantius by his seasonable sally with his troops before the battle of\r\nMursa, and although he could boast the valorous exploits of his father\r\nBonitus, a man of Frankish extraction, but who had espoused the party of\r\nConstantine, and often in the civil war had exhibited great prowess\r\nagainst the troops of Licinius, still he always feared him as a prince\r\nof wavering and fickle character.\r\n\r\n34. Now before any of these events had taken place in Gaul, it happened\r\nthat one day in the Circus Maximus at Rome, the populace cried out with\r\na loud voice, \"Silvanus is conquered.\" Whether influenced by instinct or\r\nby some prophetic spirit, cannot be decided.\r\n\r\n35. Silvanus having been slain, as I have narrated, at Agrippina, the\r\nemperor was seized with inconceivable joy when he heard the news, and\r\ngave way to exceeding insolence and arrogance, attributing this event\r\nalso to the prosperous course of his good fortune; giving the reins to\r\nhis habitual disposition which always led him to hate men of brave\r\nconduct, as Domitian in former times had done, and desiring at all\r\ntimes to destroy them by every act of opposition.\r\n\r\n36. And he was so far from praising even his act of diligence and\r\nfidelity, that he recorded in writing a charge that Ursicinus had\r\nembezzled a part of the Gallic treasures, which no one had ever touched.\r\nAnd he ordered strict inquiry to be made into the fact, by an\r\nexamination of Remigius, who was at that time accountant-general to\r\nUrsicinus in his capacity of commander of the heavy troops. And long\r\nafterwards, in the time of Valentinian, this Remigius hung himself on\r\naccount of the trouble into which he fell in the matter of his\r\nappointment as legate in Tripolis.\r\n\r\n37. And after this business was terminated, Constantius, thinking his\r\nprosperity had now raised him to an equality with the gods, and had\r\nbestowed on him entire sovereignty over human affairs, gave himself up\r\nto elation at the praises of his flatterers, whom he himself encouraged,\r\ndespising and trampling under foot all who were unskilled in that kind\r\nof court. As we read that Croesus, when he was king, drove Solon\r\nheadlong from his court because he would not fawn on him; and that\r\nDionysius threatened the poet Philoxenus with death because, when the\r\nking recited his absurd and unrhythmical verses, he alone refused to\r\nfall into an ecstasy while all the rest of the courtiers praised them.\r\n\r\n38. And this mischievous taste is the nurse of vices; for praise ought\r\nonly to be acceptable in high places, where blame also is permitted when\r\nthings are not sufficiently performed.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n§ 1. And now, after the re-establishment of security, investigations as\r\nusual were set on foot, and many persons were put in prison as guilty.\r\nFor that infernal informer Paulus, boiling over with delight, arose to\r\nexercise his poisonous employment with increased freedom, and while the\r\nmembers of the emperor's council and the military officers were employed\r\nin the investigation of these affairs, as they were commanded, Proculus\r\nwas put to the torture, who had been a servant of Silvanus, a man of\r\nweak body and of ill health; so that every one was afraid lest the\r\nexceeding violence of his torture should prove too much for his feeble\r\nlimbs, so that he would expose numbers to be implicated in the\r\naccusations of atrocious crimes. But the result proved quite different\r\nto what had been expected.\r\n\r\n2. For remembering a dream in which he had been forbidden, while asleep,\r\nas he affirmed, to accuse any innocent person, though he should be\r\ntortured till he was brought to the very point of death, he neither\r\ninformed against, nor even named any one; but, with reference to the\r\nusurpation of Silvanus, he invariably asserted that he had been driven\r\nto contemplate that act, not out of ambition, but from sheer necessity;\r\nand he proved this assertion by evident arguments.\r\n\r\n3. For he adduced one important excuse, which was established by the\r\ntestimony of many persons, that, five days before he assumed the ensigns\r\nof imperial authority, he addressed the soldiers, while distributing\r\ntheir pay to them, in the name of Constantius, exhorting them to prove\r\nalways brave and loyal. From which it was plain that if he had then been\r\nthinking of seizing on a loftier fortune, he would have given them this\r\nmoney as if it had proceeded from himself.\r\n\r\n4. After Proculus, Poemenius was condemned and put to death: he who,\r\nas we have mentioned before,[45] when the Treveri had shut their gates\r\nagainst Cæsar Decentius, was chosen to defend that people. After him,\r\nAsclepiodotus, and Luto, and Maudio, all Counts, were put to death, and\r\nmany others also, the obdurate cruelty of the times seeking for these\r\nand similar punishments with avidity.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. While the fatal disturbances of the state multiplied these general\r\nslaughters, Leontius, who was the governor of Rome itself, gave many\r\nproofs of his deserving the character of an admirable judge; being\r\nprompt in hearing cases, rigidly just in deciding them, and merciful by\r\nnature, although, for the sake of maintaining lawful authority, he\r\nappeared to some people to be severe. He was also of a somewhat amorous\r\ntemperament.\r\n\r\n2. The first pretext for exciting any sedition against him was a most\r\nslight and trumpery one. For when an order had been issued to arrest a\r\ncharioteer, named Philoromus, the whole populace followed him, as if\r\nresolved to defend something of their own, and with terrible violence\r\nassailed the prefect, presuming him to be timorous. But he remained\r\nunmoved and upright, and sending his officers among the crowd, arrested\r\nsome and punished them, and then, without any one venturing to oppose\r\nhim, or even to murmur, condemned them to banishment.\r\n\r\n3. A few days later the populace again became excited to its customary\r\nfrenzy, and alleging as a grievance the scarcity of wine, assembled at\r\nthe well-known place called Septemzodium, where the Emperor Marcus built\r\nthe Nymphæum,[46] an edifice of great magnificence. To that place the\r\nprefect went forthwith, although he was earnestly entreated by all his\r\nhousehold and civil officers not to trust himself among an arrogant and\r\nthreatening multitude, now in a state of fury equal to any of their\r\nformer commotions; but he, unsusceptible of fear, went right onwards,\r\nthough many of his attendants deserted him, when they saw him hastening\r\ninto imminent danger.\r\n\r\n4. Therefore, sitting in a carriage, with every appearance of\r\nconfidence, he looked with fierce eyes at the countenance of the\r\ntumultuous mobs thronging towards him from all quarters, and agitating\r\nthemselves like serpents. And after suffering many bitter insults, at\r\nlast, when he had recognized one man who was conspicuous among all the\r\nrest by his vast size and red hair, he asked him whether his name was\r\nPetrus Valvomeres, as he had heard it was; and when the man replied in a\r\ndefiant tone that it was so, Leontius, in spite of the outcries of many\r\naround, ordered him to be seized as one who had long since been a\r\nnotorious ringleader of the disaffected, and having his hands bound\r\nbehind him, commanded him to be suspended on a rack.\r\n\r\n5. And when he was seen in the air, in vain imploring the aid of his\r\nfellow-tribesmen, the whole mob, which a little while before was so\r\nclosely packed, dispersed at once over the different quarters of the\r\ncity, so as to offer no hindrance to the punishment of this seditious\r\nleader, who after having been thus tortured--with as little resistance\r\nas if he been in a secret dungeon of the court--was transported to\r\nPicenum, where, on a subsequent occasion, having offered violence to a\r\nvirgin of high rank, he was condemned to death by the judgment of\r\nPatruinus, a noble of consular dignity.\r\n\r\n6. While Leontius governed the city in this manner, Liberius, a priest\r\nof the Christian law, was ordered by Constantius to be brought before\r\nthe council, as one who had resisted the commands of the emperor, and\r\nthe decrees of many of his own colleagues, in an affair which I will\r\nexplain briefly.\r\n\r\n7. Athanasius was at that time bishop of Alexandria; and as he was a man\r\nwho sought to magnify himself above his profession, and to mix himself\r\nup with affairs which did not belong to his province, as continual\r\nreports made known, an assembly of many of his sect met together--a\r\nsynod, as they call it--and deprived him of the right of administering\r\nthe sacraments, which he previously enjoyed.\r\n\r\n8. For it was said that he, being very deeply skilled in the arts of\r\nprophecy and the interpretation of auguries and omens, had very often\r\npredicted coming events. And to these charges were added others very\r\ninconsistent with the laws of the religion over which he presided.\r\n\r\n9. So Liberius, being of the same opinion with those who condemned these\r\npractices, was ordered, by the sentence of the emperor, to expel\r\nAthanasius from his priestly seat; but this he firmly refused to do,\r\nreiterating the assertion that it was the extremity of wickedness to\r\ncondemn a man who had neither been brought before any court nor been\r\nheard in his defence, in this openly resisting the commands of the\r\nemperor.\r\n\r\n10. For that prince, being always unfavourable to Athanasius, although\r\nhe knew that what he ordered had in fact taken effect, yet was\r\nexceedingly desirous that it should be confirmed by that authority which\r\nthe bishops of the Eternal City enjoy, as being of higher rank. And as\r\nhe did not succeed in this, Liberius was removed by night; a measure\r\nwhich was not effected without great difficulty, through the fear which\r\nhis enemies had of the people, among whom he was exceedingly popular.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. These events, then, took place at Rome, as I have already\r\nmentioned. But Constantius was agitated by frequent intelligence which\r\nassured him that the Gauls were in a lamentable condition, since no\r\nadequate resistance could be made to the barbarians who were now\r\ncarrying their devastations with fire and sword over the whole country.\r\nAnd after deliberating a long time, in great anxiety, what force he\r\ncould employ to repel these dangers (himself remaining in Italy, as he\r\nthought it very dangerous to remove into so remote a country), he at\r\nlast determined on a wise plan, which was this: to associate with\r\nhimself in the cares of the empire his cousin Julian, whom he had some\r\ntime before summoned to court, and who still retained the robe he had\r\nworn in the Greek schools.\r\n\r\n2. And when, oppressed by the heavy weight of impending calamities, he\r\nhad confessed to his dearest friends that by himself he was unequal to\r\nthe burden of such weighty and numerous difficulties--a thing which he\r\nhad never felt before--they, being trained to excessive flattery, tried\r\nto fill him with foolish ideas, affirming that there was nothing in the\r\nworld so difficult but what his pre-eminent virtue and his good fortune,\r\nequal to that of the gods, would be able to overcome, as it always\r\nhitherto had done. And many of them added further, being stung by their\r\nconsciousness of guilt, that henceforth he ought to beware of conferring\r\nthe title of Cæsar on any one, enumerating the deeds which had been done\r\nin the time of Gallus.\r\n\r\n3. They therefore opposed his design resolutely, and it was supported by\r\nno one but the queen, who, whether it was that she feared a journey to a\r\ndistant country, or that, from her own natural wisdom, she saw the best\r\ncourse for the common good, urged him that a relation like Julian ought\r\nto be preferred to every one else. Accordingly, after many undecided\r\ndeliberations and long discussions, his resolution was at last taken\r\ndecidedly, and having discarded all further vain debate, he resolved on\r\nassociating Julian with him in the empire.\r\n\r\n4. He was therefore summoned; and when he had arrived, on a fixed day,\r\nthe whole of his fellow-comrades who were in the city were ordered to\r\nattend, and a tribunal was erected on a lofty scaffolding, surrounded by\r\nthe eagles and standards. And Augustus, mounting it, and holding Julian\r\nby the right hand, made this conciliatory speech:--\r\n\r\n5. \"We stand here before you, most excellent defenders of the republic,\r\nto avenge with one unanimous spirit the common dangers of the state. And\r\nhow I propose to provide for it I will briefly explain to you, as\r\nimpartial judges.\r\n\r\n6. \"After the death of those rebellious tyrants whom rage and madness\r\nprompted to engage in the enterprises which they undertook, the\r\nbarbarians, as if they meant to sacrifice unto their wicked manes with\r\nRoman blood, having violated the peace and invaded the territories of\r\nthe Gauls, are encouraged by this consideration, that our empire, being\r\nspread over very remote countries, causes us to be beset with great\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\n7. \"If, then, your decision and mine are mutual to encounter this evil,\r\nalready progressing beyond the barriers which were opposed to it, while\r\nthere is still time to check it, the necks of these haughty nations will\r\nlearn to humble their pride, and the borders of the empire will remain\r\ninviolate. It remains for you to give, by your strength, prosperous\r\neffect to the hopes which I entertain.\r\n\r\n8. \"You all know my cousin Julian, whom I here present to you; a youth\r\nendeared to us by his modesty as well as by his relationship; a youth of\r\nvirtue already proved, and of conspicuous industry and energy. Him I\r\nhave determined to raise to the rank of Cæsar, and hope, if this seems\r\nexpedient to you, to have my decision confirmed by your consent.\"\r\n\r\n9. He was proceeding to say more, but was prevented by the whole\r\nassembly interrupting him with friendly shouts, declaring that his\r\ndecision was the judgment of the Supreme Deity, and not of any human\r\nmind; with such certainty that one might have thought them inspired\r\nwith the spirit of prophecy.\r\n\r\n10. The emperor stood without moving till they resumed silence, and then\r\nwith greater confidence proceeded to explain what he had to say further.\r\n\r\n\"Because, therefore, your joyful acclamations show that you look\r\nfavourably on the design I have announced, let this youth, of tranquil\r\nstrength, whose temperate disposition it will be better to imitate than\r\nmerely to praise, rise up now to receive the honours prepared for him.\r\nHis excellent disposition, increased as it has been by all liberal\r\naccomplishments, I will say no more of than is seen in the fact that I\r\nhave chosen him. Therefore, now, with the manifest consent of the Deity,\r\nI will clothe him with the imperial robe.\"\r\n\r\n11. This was his speech. And then, having immediately clothed Julian\r\nwith the purple robe of his ancestors, and having pronounced him Cæsar,\r\nto the great joy of the army, he thus addressed him, though Julian\r\nhimself appeared by his grave countenance to be somewhat melancholy.\r\n\r\n12. \"Most beloved of all my brothers, you thus in early youth have\r\nreceived the splendid honour belonging to your birth, not, I confess,\r\nwithout some addition to my own glory; who thus show myself as just in\r\nconferring supreme power on a noble character nearly related to me, as I\r\nappear also sublime by virtue of my own power. Come thou, therefore, to\r\nbe a partner in my labours and dangers, and undertake the defence of the\r\ngovernment of the Gauls, devoting thyself with all beneficence to\r\nalleviate the calamities of those afflicted countries.\r\n\r\n13. \"And if it should be necessary to engage with the enemy in battle,\r\ndo thou take thy place steadily among the standard-bearers themselves,\r\nas a prudent encourager of daring at the proper opportunity; exciting\r\nthe warriors by leading them on with caution, supporting any troops\r\nwhich may be thrown into disorder by reserves, gently reproving those\r\nwho hang back, and being present as a trustworthy witness of the actions\r\nof all, whether brave or timid.\r\n\r\n14. \"Think that a serious crisis is upon us, and so show yourself a\r\ngreat man, worthy to command brave men. We ourselves will stand by you\r\nin the energetic constancy of affection, or will join you in the\r\nlabours of war, so that we may govern together the whole world in peace,\r\nif only God will grant us, as we pray he may, to govern with equal\r\nmoderation and piety. You will everywhere represent me, and I also will\r\nnever desert you in whatever task you may be engaged. To sum up: Go\r\nforth; go forth supported by the friendly prayers of men of all ranks,\r\nto defend with watchful care the station assigned to you, it may be\r\nsaid, by the republic itself.\"\r\n\r\n15. After the emperor had thus ended his speech, no one held his peace,\r\nbut all the soldiers, with a tremendous crash, rattled their shields\r\nagainst their knees (which is an abundant indication of applause; while\r\non the other hand to strike the shield with the spear is a testimony of\r\nanger and indignation), and it was marvellous with what excessive joy\r\nthey all, except a very few, showed their approbation of the judgment of\r\nAugustus: and they received the Cæsar with well-deserved admiration,\r\nbrilliant as he was with the splendour of the imperial purple.\r\n\r\n16. And while they gazed earnestly on his eyes, terrible in their\r\nbeauty, and his countenance more attractive than ever by reason of his\r\npresent excitement, they augured from his looks what kind of ruler he\r\nwas likely to prove, as if they had been searching into those ancient\r\nvolumes which teach how to judge of a man's moral disposition by the\r\nexternal signs on his person. And that he might be regarded with the\r\ngreater reverence, they neither praised him above measure, nor yet below\r\nhis desert. And so the voices raised in his favour were looked upon as\r\nthe judgment of censors, not of soldiers.\r\n\r\n17. After the ceremony was over, Julian was taken up into the imperial\r\nchariot and received into the palace, and was heard to whisper to\r\nhimself this verse of Homer--\r\n\r\n  \"Now purple death hath seized on me,\r\n  And powerful strength of destiny.\"\r\n\r\nThese transactions took place on the sixth of November, in the year of\r\nthe consulship of Arbetio and Lollianus.\r\n\r\n18. A few days afterwards, Helen, the maiden sister of Constantius, was\r\nalso given in marriage to the Cæsar. And everything being got ready\r\nwhich the journey required, he started on the first of December with a\r\nsmall retinue, and having been escorted on his way by Augustus himself\r\nas far as the spot, marked by two pillars, which lies between Laumellum\r\nand Ticinum, he proceeded straight on to the country of the Taurini,\r\nwhere he received disastrous intelligence, which had recently reached\r\nthe emperor's court, but still had been intentionally kept back, lest\r\nall the preparations made for his journey should be wasted.\r\n\r\n19. And this intelligence was that Colonia Agrippina,[47] a city of\r\ngreat renown in lower Germany, had been carried by a vigorous siege of\r\nthe barbarians, who appeared before it in great force, and had utterly\r\ndestroyed it.\r\n\r\n20. Julian being greatly distressed at this news, looking on it as a\r\nkind of omen of misfortunes to come, was often heard to murmur in\r\nquerulous tones, \"that he had gained nothing except the fate of dying\r\namid greater trouble and employment than before.\"\r\n\r\n21. But when he arrived at Vienne, people of every age and class went\r\nforth to meet him on his entrance to the city, with a view to do him\r\nhonour by their reception of him as one who had been long wished for,\r\nand was now granted to their prayers. And when he was seen in the\r\ndistance the whole population of the city and of the adjacent\r\nneighbourhood, going before his chariot, celebrated his praises,\r\nsaluting him as Emperor, clement and prosperous, greeting with eager joy\r\nthis royal procession in honour of a lawful prince. And they placed all\r\ntheir hopes of a remedy for the evils which affected the whole province\r\non his arrival, thinking that now, when their affairs were in a most\r\ndesperate condition, some friendly genius had come to shine upon them.\r\n\r\n22. And a blind old woman, when in reply to her question \"Who was\r\nentering the city?\" she received for answer \"Julian the Cæsar,\" cried\r\nout that \"He would restore the temples of the gods.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\n§ 1. Now then, since, as the sublime poet of Mantua has sung, \"A greater\r\nseries of incident rises to my view; in a more arduous task I\r\nengage,\"--I think it a proper opportunity to describe the situation and\r\ndifferent countries of the Gauls, lest, among the narration of fiery\r\npreparations and the various chances of battles, I should seem, while\r\nspeaking of matters not understood by every one, to resemble those\r\nnegligent sailors, who, when tossed about by dangerous waves and storms,\r\nbegin to repair their sails and ropes which they might have attended to\r\nin calm weather.\r\n\r\n2. Ancient writers, pursuing their investigations into the earliest\r\norigin of the Gauls, left our knowledge of the truth very imperfect; but\r\nat a later period, Timagenes, a thorough Greek both in diligence and\r\nlanguage, collected, from various writings facts which had been long\r\nunknown, and guided by his faithful statements, we, dispelling all\r\nobscurity, will now give a plain and intelligible relation of them.\r\n\r\n3. Some persons affirm that the first inhabitants ever seen in these\r\nregions were called Celts, after the name of their king, who was very\r\npopular among them, and sometimes also Galatæ, after the name of his\r\nmother. For Galatæ is the Greek translation of the Roman term Galli.\r\nOthers affirm that they are Dorians, who, following a more ancient\r\nHercules, selected for their home the districts bordering on the ocean.\r\n\r\n4. The Druids affirm that a portion of the people was really indigenous\r\nto the soil, but that other inhabitants poured in from the islands on\r\nthe coast, and from the districts across the Rhine, having been driven\r\nfrom their former abodes by frequent wars, and sometimes by inroads of\r\nthe tempestuous sea.\r\n\r\n5. Some again maintain that after the destruction of Troy, a few Trojans\r\nfleeing from the Greeks, who were then scattered over the whole world,\r\noccupied these districts, which at that time had no inhabitants at all.\r\n\r\n6. But the natives of these countries affirm this more positively than\r\nany other fact (and, indeed, we ourselves have read it engraved on their\r\nmonuments), that Hercules, the son of Amphitryon, hastening to the\r\ndestruction of those cruel tyrants, Geryon and Tauriscus, one of whom\r\nwas oppressing the Gauls, and the other Spain, after he had conquered\r\nboth of them, took to wife some women of noble birth in those countries,\r\nand became the father of many children; and that his sons called the\r\ndistricts of which they became the kings after their own names.\r\n\r\n7. Also an Asiatic tribe coming from Phocæa in order to escape the\r\ncruelty of Harpalus, the lieutenant of Cyrus the king, sought to sail to\r\nItaly.[48] And a part of them founded Velia, in Lucania, others settled\r\na colony at Marseilles, in the territory of Vienne; and then, in\r\nsubsequent ages, these towns increasing in strength and importance,\r\nfounded other cities. But we must avoid a variety of details which are\r\ncommonly apt to weary.\r\n\r\n8. Throughout these provinces, the people gradually becoming civilized,\r\nthe study of liberal accomplishments flourished, having been first\r\nintroduced by the Bards, the Eubages,[49] and the Druids. The Bards were\r\naccustomed to employ themselves in celebrating the brave achievements of\r\ntheir illustrious men, in epic verse, accompanied with sweet airs on the\r\nlyre. The Eubages investigated the system and sublime secrets of nature,\r\nand sought to explain them to their followers. Between these two came\r\nthe Druids, men of loftier genius, bound in brotherhoods according to\r\nthe precepts and example of Pythagoras; and their minds were elevated by\r\ninvestigations into secret and sublime matters, and from the contempt\r\nwhich they entertained for human affairs they pronounced the soul\r\nimmortal.\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\n§ 1. This country then of the Gauls was by reason of its lofty mountain\r\nranges perpetually covered with terrible snows, almost unknown to the\r\ninhabitants of the rest of the world, except where it borders on the\r\nocean; vast fortresses raised by nature, in the place of art,\r\nsurrounding it on all sides.\r\n\r\n2. On the southern side it is washed by the Etruscan and Gallic sea:\r\nwhere it looks towards the north it is separated from the tribes of the\r\nbarbarians by the river Rhine; where it is placed under the western star\r\nit is bounded by the ocean, and the lofty chain of the Pyrenees; where\r\nit has an eastern aspect it is bounded by the Cottian[50] Alps. In these\r\nmountains King Cottius, after the Gauls had been subdued, lying by\r\nhimself in their defiles, and relying on the rugged and pathless\r\ncharacter of the country, long maintained his independence; though\r\nafterwards he abated his pride, and was admitted to the friendship of\r\nthe Emperor Octavianus. And subsequently he constructed immense works to\r\nserve as a splendid gift to the emperor, making roads over them, short,\r\nand convenient for travellers, between other ancient passes of the Alps;\r\non which subject we will presently set forth what discoveries have been\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n3. In these Cottian Alps, which begin at the town of Susa, one vast\r\nridge rises up, scarcely passable by any one without danger.\r\n\r\n4. For to travellers who reach it from the side of Gaul it descends with\r\na steepness almost precipitous, being terrible to behold, in consequence\r\nof the bulk of its overhanging rocks. In the spring, when the ice is\r\nmelting, and the snow beginning to give way from the warm spring\r\nbreezes, if any one seeks to descend along the mountain, men and beasts\r\nand wagons all fall together through the fissures and clefts in the\r\nrocks, which yawn in every direction, though previously hidden by the\r\nfrost. And the only remedy ever found to ward off entire destruction is\r\nto have many vehicles bound together with enormous ropes, with men or\r\noxen hanging on behind, to hold them back with great efforts; and so\r\nwith a crouching step they get down with some degree of safety. And\r\nthis, as I have said, is what happens in the spring.\r\n\r\n5. But in winter, the ground being covered over with a smooth crust of\r\nice, and therefore slippery under foot, the traveller is often plunged\r\nheadlong; and the valleys, which seem to open here and there into wide\r\nplains, which are merely a covering of treacherous ice, sometimes\r\nswallow up those who try to pass over them. On account of which danger\r\nthose who are acquainted with the country fix projecting wooden piles\r\nover the safest spots, in order that a series of them may conduct the\r\ntraveller unhurt to his destination; though if these piles get covered\r\nwith snow and hidden, or thrown down by melting torrents descending from\r\nthe mountains, then it is difficult for any one to pass, even if natives\r\nof the district lead the way.\r\n\r\n6. But on the summit of this Italian mountain there is a plain, seven\r\nmiles in extent, reaching as far as the station known by the name of\r\nMars; and after that comes another ridge, still more steep, and scarcely\r\npossible to be climbed, which stretches on to the summit of Mons\r\nMatrona, named so from an event which happened to a noble lady.\r\n\r\n7. From this point a path, steep indeed, but easily passable, leads to\r\nthe fortress of Virgantia.[51] The sepulchre of this petty prince whom\r\nwe have spoken of as the maker of these roads is at Susa, close to the\r\nwalls; and his remains are honoured with religious veneration for two\r\nreasons: first of all, because he governed his people with equitable\r\nmoderation; and secondly, because, by becoming an ally of the Roman\r\nrepublic, he procured lasting tranquillity for his subjects.\r\n\r\n8. And although this road which I have been speaking of runs through the\r\ncentre of the district, and is shorter and more frequented now than any\r\nother, yet other roads also were made at much earlier periods, on\r\ndifferent occasions.\r\n\r\n9. The first of them, near the maritime alps, was made by the Theban\r\nHercules, when he was proceeding in a leisurely manner to destroy Geryon\r\nand Tauriscus, as has already been mentioned; and he it was who gave to\r\nthese alps the name of the Grecian Alps.[52] In the same way he\r\nconsecrated the citadel and port of Monæcus to keep alive the\r\nrecollection of his name for ever. And this was the reason why, many\r\nages afterwards, those alps were called the Penine Alps.[53]\r\n\r\n10. Publius Cornelius Scipio, the father of the elder Africanus, when\r\nabout to go to the assistance of the citizens of Saguntum--celebrated\r\nfor the distresses which they endured, and for their loyalty to Rome, at\r\nthe time when they were besieged with great resolution by the\r\nCarthaginians--led to the Spanish coast a fleet having on board a\r\nnumerous army. But after the city had been destroyed by the valour of\r\nthe Carthaginians, he, being unable to overtake Hannibal, who had\r\ncrossed the Rhone, and had obtained three days' start of him in the\r\nmarch towards Italy, crossed the sea, which at that point was not wide,\r\nmaking a rapid voyage; and taking his station near Genoa, a town of the\r\nLigures, awaited his descent from the mountains, so that, if chance\r\nshould afford him an opportunity, he might attack him in the plain while\r\nstill fatigued with the ruggedness of the way by which he had come.\r\n\r\n11. But still, having regard to the interests of the republic, he\r\nordered Cnæus Scipio, his brother, to go into Spain, to prevent\r\nHasdrubal from making a similar expedition from that country. But\r\nHannibal, having received information of their design by some deserters,\r\nbeing also a man of great shrewdness and readiness of resources,\r\nobtained some guides from the Taurini who inhabited those districts, and\r\npassing through the Tricastini and through the district of the Vocontii,\r\nhe thus reached the defiles of the Tricorii.[54] Then starting from this\r\npoint, he made another march over a line previously impassable. And\r\nhaving cut through a rock of immense height, which he melted by means of\r\nmighty fires, and pouring over it a quantity of vinegar, he proceeded\r\nalong the Druentia, a river full of danger from its eddies and currents,\r\nuntil he reached the district of Etruria. This is enough to say of the\r\nAlps; now let us return to our original subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\n§ 1. In former times, when these provinces were little known, as being\r\nbarbarous, they were considered to be divided into three races:[55]\r\nnamely, the Celtæ, the same who are also called Galli; the Aquitani,\r\nand the Belgæ: all differing from each other in language, manners, and\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\n2. The Galli, who, as I have said, are the same as the Celtæ, are\r\ndivided from the Aquitani by the river Garonne, which rises in the\r\nmountains of the Pyrenees; and after passing through many towns, loses\r\nitself in the ocean.\r\n\r\n3. On the other side they are separated from the Belgians by the Marne\r\nand the Seine, both rivers of considerable size, which flowing through\r\nthe tribe of the Lugdunenses, after surrounding the stronghold of the\r\nParisii named Lutetia, so as to make an island of it, proceed onwards\r\ntogether, and fall into the sea near the camp of Constantius.\r\n\r\n4. Of all these people the Belgians are said by ancient writers to be\r\nthe most warlike, because, being more remote from civilization, and not\r\nhaving been rendered effeminate by foreign luxuries, they have been\r\nengaged in continual wars with the Germans on the other side of the\r\nRhine.\r\n\r\n5. For the Aquitanians, to whose shores, as being nearest and also\r\npacific, foreign merchandise is abundantly imported, were easily brought\r\nunder the dominion of the Romans, because their character had become\r\nenervated.\r\n\r\n6. But from the time when the Gauls, after long and repeated wars,\r\nsubmitted to the dictator Julius, all their provinces were governed by\r\nRoman officers, the country being divided into four portions; one of\r\nwhich was the province of Narbonne; containing the districts of Vienne\r\nand Lyons: a second province comprehended all the tribes of the\r\nAquitanians; upper and lower Germany formed a third jurisdiction, and\r\nthe Belgians a fourth at that period.\r\n\r\n7. But now the whole extent of the country is portioned out into many\r\nprovinces. The second (or lower) Germany is the first, if you begin on\r\nthe western side, fortified by Cologne and Tongres, both cities of great\r\nwealth and importance.\r\n\r\n8. Next comes the first (or high) Germany, in which, besides other\r\nmunicipal towns, there is Mayence, and Worms, and Spiers, and Strasburg,\r\na city celebrated for the defeats sustained by the barbarians in its\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\n9. After these the first Belgic province stretches as far as Metz and\r\nTreves, which city is the splendid abode of the chief governor of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n10. Next to that comes the second Belgic province, where we find Amiens,\r\na city of conspicuous magnificence, and Châlons,[56] and Rheims.\r\n\r\n11. In the province of the Sequani, the finest cities are Besançon and\r\nBasle. The first Lyonnese province contains Lyons, Châlons,[57] Sens,\r\nBourges, and Autun, the walls of which are very extensive and of great\r\nantiquity.\r\n\r\n12. In the second Lyonnese province are Tours, and Rouen, Evreux, and\r\nTroyes. The Grecian and Penine Alps have, besides other towns of less\r\nnote, Avenche, a city which indeed is now deserted, but which was\r\nformerly one of no small importance, as even now is proved by its\r\nhalf-ruinous edifices. These are the most important provinces, and most\r\nsplendid cities of the Galli.\r\n\r\n13. In Aquitania, which looks towards the Pyrenees, and that part of the\r\nocean which belongs to the Spaniards, the first province is Aquitanica,\r\nvery rich in large and populous cities; passing over others, I may\r\nmention as pre-eminent, Bordeaux, Clermont, Saintes, and Poictiers.\r\n\r\n14. The province called the Nine Nations is enriched by Ausch and Bazas.\r\nIn the province of Narbonne, the cities of Narbonne, Euses, and Toulouse\r\nare the principal places of importance. The Viennese exults in the\r\nmagnificence of many cities, the chief of which are Vienne itself, and\r\nArles, and Valence; to which may be added Marseilles, by the alliance\r\nwith and power of which we read that Rome itself was more than once\r\nsupported in moments of danger.\r\n\r\n15. And near to these cities is also Aix, Nice, Antibes, and the islands\r\nof Hieres.\r\n\r\n16. And since we have come in the progress of our work to this district,\r\nit would be inconsistent and absurd to omit all mention of the Rhone, a\r\nriver of the greatest celebrity. The Rhone rises in the Penine Alps,\r\nfrom sources of great abundance, and descending with headlong\r\nimpetuosity into the more champaign districts, it often overruns its\r\nbanks with its own waters, and then plunges into a lake called Lake\r\nLeman, and though it passes through it, yet it never mingles with any\r\nforeign waters, but, rushing over the top of those which flow with less\r\nrapidity, in its search for an exit, it forces its own way by the\r\nviolence of its stream.\r\n\r\n17. And thus passing through that lake without any damage, it runs\r\nthrough Savoy and the district of Franche Comté; and, after a long\r\ncourse, it forms the boundary between the Viennese on its left, and the\r\nLyonnese on its right. Then after many windings it receives the Saône, a\r\nriver which rises in the first Germany, and this latter river here\r\nmerges its name in the Rhone. At this point is the beginning of the\r\nGauls. And from this spot the distances are measured not by miles but by\r\nleagues.\r\n\r\n18. From this point also, the Rhone, being now enriched by other rivers,\r\nbecomes navigable for large vessels, which are often tossed about in it\r\nby gales of wind; and at last, having finished the course which nature\r\nhas marked out for it, foaming on it joins the Gallic Sea in the wide\r\ngulf which they call the Gulf of Lyons, about eighteen miles from Arles.\r\nThis is enough to say of the situation of the province; I will now\r\nproceed to describe the appearance and character of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. Nearly all the Gauls are of a lofty stature, fair, and of ruddy\r\ncomplexion; terrible from the sternness of their eyes, very quarrelsome,\r\nand of great pride and insolence. A whole troop of foreigners would not\r\nbe able to withstand a single Gaul if he called his wife to his\r\nassistance, who is usually very strong, and with blue eyes; especially\r\nwhen, swelling her neck, gnashing her teeth, and brandishing her sallow\r\narms of enormous size, she begins to strike blows mingled with kicks, as\r\nif they were so many missiles sent from the string of a catapult.\r\n\r\n2. The voices of the generality are formidable and threatening, whether\r\nthey are in good humour or angry: they are all exceedingly careful of\r\ncleanliness and neatness, nor in all the country, and most especially in\r\nAquitania, could any man or woman, however poor, be seen either dirty or\r\nragged.\r\n\r\n3. The men of every age are equally inclined to war, and the old man and\r\nthe man in the prime of life answer with equal zeal the call to arms,\r\ntheir bodies being hardened by their cold weather and by constant\r\nexercise so that they are all inclined to despise dangers and terrors.\r\nNor has any one of this nation ever mutilated his thumb from fear of the\r\ntoils of war, as men have done in Italy, whom in their district are\r\ncalled Murci.\r\n\r\n4. The nation is fond of wine, and of several kinds of liquor which\r\nresemble wine. And many individuals of the lower orders, whose senses\r\nhave become impaired by continual intoxication, which the apophthegm of\r\nCato defined to be a kind of voluntary madness, run about in all\r\ndirections at random; so that there appears to be some point in that\r\nsaying which is found in Cicero's oration in defence of Fonteius, \"that\r\nhenceforth the Gauls will drink their wine less strong than formerly,\"\r\nbecause forsooth they thought there was poison in it.\r\n\r\n5. These countries, and especially such parts of them as border on\r\nItaly, fell gradually under the dominion of the Romans without much\r\ntrouble to their conquerors, having been first attacked by Fulvius,\r\nafterwards weakened in many trifling combats by Sextius, and at last\r\nentirely subdued by Fabius Maximus; who gained an additional surname\r\nfrom the complete accomplishment of this task, after he had brought into\r\nsubjection the fierce tribe of the Allobroges.\r\n\r\n6. Cæsar finally subdued all the Gauls, except where their country was\r\nabsolutely inaccessible from its morasses, as we learn from Sallust,\r\nafter a war of ten years, in which both nations suffered many disasters;\r\nand at last he united them to us in eternal alliance by formal treaties.\r\nI have digressed further than I had intended, but now I will return to\r\nmy original subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. After Domitianus had perished by a cruel death, Musonianus his\r\nsuccessor governed the East with the rank of prætorian prefect; a man\r\ncelebrated for his eloquence and thorough knowledge of both the Greek\r\nand Latin languages; from which he reaped a loftier glory than he\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\n2. For when Constantine was desirous of obtaining a more accurate\r\nknowledge of the different sects in the empire, the Manicheans and other\r\nsimilar bodies, and no one could be found able sufficiently to explain\r\nthem, Musonianus was chosen for the task, having been recommended as\r\ncompetent; and when he had discharged this duty with skill, the emperor\r\ngave him the name of Musonianus, for he had been previously called\r\nStrategius. After that he ran through many degrees of rank and honour,\r\nand soon reached the dignity of prefect; being in other matters also a\r\nman of wisdom, popular in the provinces, and of a mild and courteous\r\ndisposition. But at the same time, whenever he could find an\r\nopportunity, especially in any controversies or lawsuits (which is most\r\nshameful and wicked), he was greatly devoted to sordid gain. Not to\r\nmention many other instances, this was especially exemplified in the\r\ninvestigations which were made into the death of Theophilus, the\r\ngovernor of Syria, a man of consular rank, who gave information against\r\nthe Cæsar Gallus, and who was torn to pieces in a tumult of the people;\r\nfor which several poor men were condemned, who, it was clearly proved,\r\nwere at a distance at the time of the transaction, while certain rich\r\nmen who were the real authors of the crime were spared from all\r\npunishment, except the confiscation of their property.\r\n\r\n3. In this he was equalled by Prosper, at that time master of the horse\r\nin Gaul; a man of abject spirit and great inactivity; and, as the comic\r\npoet has it, despising the acts of secret robbing he plundered\r\nopenly.[58]\r\n\r\n4. And, while these two officers were conniving together, and\r\nreciprocally helping each other to many means of acquiring riches, the\r\nchiefs of the Persian nation who lived nearest to the river, profiting\r\nby the fact that the king was occupied in the most distant parts of his\r\ndominions, and that these commanders were occupied in plundering the\r\npeople placed under their authority, began to harass our territories\r\nwith predatory bands, making audacious inroads, sometimes into Armenia,\r\noften also into Mesopotamia.\r\n\r\n\r\n[32] Tlepolemus and Hiero, whom Cicero, Verres iii. 11, calls Cibyratici\r\ncanes.\r\n\r\n[33] Herodotus, iv. 184, records that in Africa, in the country about\r\nMount Atlas, dreams are unknown.\r\n\r\n[34] Lintz.\r\n\r\n[35] The district around Bellinzona.\r\n\r\n[36] The Bodensee, more generally known as the Lake of Constance: at its\r\nsouth-eastern end is the town of Bregenz, the ancient Brigantia.\r\n\r\n[37] The Arethusa is in Sicily, near Syracuse.\r\n\r\n[38] The Comites were a picked body of troops, divided into several\r\nregiments distinguished by separate names, such as Seniores, Juniores,\r\nSagittarii, &c.\r\n\r\n[39] The Promoti were also picked men, something like the Comites; the\r\nFrench translator calls them the Veterans.\r\n\r\n[40] From +koptô+ to cut, and +mattya+ any delicate food;\r\nmeant as equivalent to our cheeseparer, or skinflint.\r\n\r\n[41] This was a very important post; it seems to have united the\r\nfunctions of a modern chamberlain, chancellor, and secretary of state.\r\nThe master presented citizens to the emperor, received foreign\r\nambassadors, recommended men for civil employments, decided civil\r\nactions of several kinds, and superintended many of the affairs of the\r\npost.\r\n\r\n[42] Cologne.\r\n\r\n[43] The dragons were the effigies on some of the standards.\r\n\r\n[44] There is no such passage in any extant work of Cicero, but a\r\nsentence in his speech ad Pontifices resembles it: \"For although it be\r\nmore desirable to end one's life without pain, and without injury, still\r\nit tends more to an immortality of glory to be regretted by one's\r\ncountrymen, than to have been always free from injury.\" And a still\r\ncloser likeness to the sentiment is found in his speech ad Quirites post\r\nreditum: \"Although there is nothing more to be wished for by man than\r\nprosperous, equal, continual good-fortune in life, flowing on in a\r\nprosperous course, without any misadventure; still, if all my life had\r\nbeen tranquil and peaceful, I should have been deprived of the\r\nincredible and almost heavenly delight and happiness which I now enjoy\r\nthrough your kindness.\"--Orations, v. 2; Bohn, p. 491-2.\r\n\r\n[45] In one of the lost books of this history.\r\n\r\n[46] The Nymphæum was a temple sacred to the Nymphs, deriving its name\r\nof Septemzodium, or Septizonium (which it shared with more than one\r\nother building at Rome), from the seven rows of pillars, one above the\r\nother, and each row lessening both in circuit and in height, with which\r\nthe exterior was embellished. Another temple of this kind was built by\r\nSeptimius Severus.\r\n\r\n[47] Cologne.\r\n\r\n[48] This story of the Phocæenses is told by Herodotus, i. 166, and\r\nalluded to by Horace, Epod. xv. 10.\r\n\r\n[49] The Eubages, or +Ouateis+, as Strabo calls them, appear to\r\nhave been a tribe of priests.\r\n\r\n[50] The Cottian Alps are Mont Genevre. It is unnecessary to point out\r\nhow Ammianus mistakes the true bearing of these frontiers of Gaul.\r\n\r\n[51] Briançon.\r\n\r\n[52] The Graiæ Alps are the Little St. Bernard; and it was over them\r\nthat Hannibal really passed, as has been conclusively proved by Dr. J.A.\r\nCramer.\r\n\r\n[53] From the god Pen, or Peninus, Liv. xxi. 38. The Alpes Peninæ are\r\nthe Great St. Bernard.\r\n\r\n[54] Compare Livy's account of Hannibal's march, from which, wholly\r\nerroneous as it is, this description seems to have been taken; not that\r\neven Livy has made such a gross mistake about the Druentia, or Durance,\r\nwhich falls into the Rhone.\r\n\r\n[55] Cæsar's account of his expedition begins with the statement that\r\n\"Gaul is divided into three provinces.\"\r\n\r\n[56] Châlons sur Marne.\r\n\r\n[57] Châlons sur Saône.\r\n\r\n[58] Ammianus refers to Plautus, Epidicus, Act. I., sc. i., line 10:--\r\n\r\n     _Thesprio._ I am less of a pilferer now than formerly.\r\n\r\n     _Ep._ How so?\r\n\r\n     _Thes._ I rob openly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK XVI.\r\n\r\nARGUMENT.\r\n\r\n     I.

While the chain of destiny was bringing these events to pass in the\r\nRoman world, Julian, being at Vienne, was taken by the emperor, then in\r\nhis own eighth consulship, as a partner in that dignity; and, under the\r\npromptings of his own innate energy, dreamt of nothing but the crash of\r\nbattles and the slaughter of the barbarians; preparing without delay to\r\nre-establish the province, and to reunite the fragments that had been\r\nbroken from it, if only fortune should be favourable to him.\r\n\r\n2. And because the great achievements which by his valour and good\r\nfortune Julian performed in the Gauls, surpass many of the most gallant\r\nexploits of the ancients, I will relate them in order as they occurred,\r\nemploying all the resources of my talents, moderate as they are, in the\r\nhope that they may suffice for the narrative.\r\n\r\n3. But what I am about to relate, though not emblazoned by craftily\r\ndevised falsehood, and being simply a plain statement of facts,\r\nsupported by evident proofs, will have all the effect of a studied\r\npanegyric.\r\n\r\n4. For it would seem that some principle of a more than commonly\r\nvirtuous life guided this young prince from his very cradle to his last\r\nbreath. Increasing rapidly in every desirable quality, he soon became so\r\nconspicuous both at home and abroad, that in respect to his prudence he\r\nwas looked upon as a second Titus: in his glorious deeds of war he was\r\naccounted equal to Trajan; in mercy he was the prototype of Antoninus;\r\nand in the pursuit and discovery of true and perfect wisdom, he\r\nresembled Marcus Aurelius, in imitation of whom he formed all his\r\nactions and character.\r\n\r\n5. And since, as we are taught by Cicero, that the loftiness of great\r\nvirtues delights us, as does that of high trees, while we are not\r\nequally interested in the roots and trunks; so, also, the first\r\nbeginnings of his admirable disposition were kept concealed by many\r\ncircumstances which threw a cloud over them; though in fact they ought\r\nto be preferred to many of his most marvellous actions of later life, in\r\nthat he, who in his early youth had been brought up like Erectheus in\r\nthe retirement sacred to Minerva, nevertheless when he was drawn forth\r\nfrom the quiet shades of the academy (and not from any military tent)\r\ninto the labours of war, subdued Germany, tranquillized the districts of\r\nthe frozen Rhine, routed the barbarian kings breathing nothing but\r\nbloodshed and slaughter, and forced them to submission.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. Therefore while passing a toilsome winter in the city aforesaid, he\r\nlearnt, among the numerous reports which were flying about, that the\r\nancient city of Autun, the walls of which, though of vast extent, were\r\nin a state of great decay from age, was now besieged by the barbarians,\r\nwho had suddenly appeared before it in great force; and while the\r\ngarrison remained panic-stricken and inactive, the town was defended by\r\na body of veterans who were behaving with great courage and vigilance;\r\nas it often happens that extreme despair repulses dangers which appear\r\ndestructive of all hope or safety.\r\n\r\n2. Therefore, without relaxing his anxiety about other matters, and\r\nputting aside all the adulation of the courtiers with which they sought\r\nto divert his mind towards voluptuousness and luxury, he hastened his\r\npreparations, and when everything was ready he set out, and on the 24th\r\nof June arrived at Autun; behaving like a veteran general conspicuous\r\nalike for skill and prowess, and prepared to fall upon the barbarians,\r\nwho were straggling in every direction over the country, the moment\r\nfortune afforded him an opportunity.\r\n\r\n3. Therefore having deliberated on his plans, and consulted those who\r\nwere acquainted with the country as to what would be the safest line of\r\nmarch for him to adopt, after having received much information in favour\r\nof different routes, some recommending Arbois, others insisting on it\r\nthat the best way was by Saulieu and Cure.\r\n\r\n4. But as some persons affirmed that Silvanus, in command of a body of\r\ninfantry, had, a short time before, made his way with 8,000 men by a\r\nroad shorter than either, but dangerous as lying through many dark woods\r\nand defiles suitable for ambuscades, Julian became exceedingly eager to\r\nimitate the audacity of this brave man.\r\n\r\n5. And to prevent any delay, taking with him only his cuirassiers and\r\narchers, who would not have been sufficient to defend his person had he\r\nbeen attacked, he took the same route as Silvanus; and so came to\r\nAuxerre.\r\n\r\n6. And there, having, according to his custom, devoted a short time to\r\nrest, for the purpose of refreshing his men, he proceeded onwards\r\ntowards Troyes; and strengthened his flanks that he might with the\r\ngreater effect watch the barbarians, who attacked him in numerous\r\nbodies, which he avoided as well as he could, thinking them more\r\nnumerous than they really were. Presently, however, having occupied some\r\nfavourable ground, he descended upon one body of them, and routed it,\r\nand took some prisoners whom their own fears delivered to him; and then\r\nhe allowed the rest, who now devoted all their energies to flying with\r\nwhat speed they could, to escape unattacked, as his men could not pursue\r\nthem by reason of the weight of their armour.\r\n\r\n7. This occurrence gave him more hope of being able to resist any attack\r\nwhich they might make, and marching forwards with this confidence, after\r\nmany dangers he reached Troyes so unexpectedly, that when he arrived at\r\nthe gates, the inhabitants for some time hesitated to give him entrance\r\ninto the city, so great was their fear of the straggling multitudes of\r\nthe barbarians.\r\n\r\n8. After a little delay, devoted to again refreshing his weary troops,\r\nthinking that there was no time to waste, he proceeded to the city of\r\nRheims, where he had ordered his whole army, carrying[59] ... to\r\nassemble, and there to await his presence. The army at Rheims was under\r\nthe command of Marcellus, the successor of Ursicinus; and Ursicinus\r\nhimself was ordered to remain there till the termination of the\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\n9. Again Julian took counsel, and after many opinions of different\r\npurport had been delivered, it was determined to attack the host of the\r\nAllemanni in the neighbourhood of Dieuse; and to that quarter the army\r\nnow marched in dense order, and with more than usual alacrity.\r\n\r\n10. And because the weather, being damp and misty, prevented even what\r\nwas near from being seen, the enemy, availing themselves of their\r\nknowledge of the country, came by an oblique road upon the Cæsar's rear,\r\nand attacked two legions while they were piling their arms; and they\r\nwould almost have destroyed them if the uproar which suddenly arose had\r\nnot brought the auxiliary troops of the allies to their support.\r\n\r\n11. From this time forth Julian, thinking it impossible to find any\r\nroads or any rivers free from ambuscades, proceeded with consummate\r\nprudence and caution; qualities which above all others in great generals\r\nusually bring safety and success to armies.\r\n\r\n12. Hearing therefore that Strasburg, Brumat, Saverne, Spiers, Worms,\r\nand Mayence, were all in the hands of the barbarians, who were\r\nestablished in their suburbs, for the barbarians shunned fixing\r\nthemselves in the towns themselves, looking upon them like graves\r\nsurrounded with nets, he first of all entered Brumat, and just as he\r\nreached that place he was encountered by a body of Germans prepared for\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\n13. Having arranged his own army in the form of a crescent, the\r\nengagement began, and the enemy were speedily surrounded and utterly\r\ndefeated. Some were taken prisoners, others were slain in the heat of\r\nthe battle, the rest sought safety by rapid flight.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. After this, meeting with no resistance, he determined to proceed to\r\nrecover Cologne, which had been destroyed before his arrival in Gaul.\r\nIn that district there is no city or fortress to be seen except that\r\nnear Confluentes;[60] a place so named because there the river Moselle\r\nbecomes mingled with the Rhine; there is also the village of Rheinmagen,\r\nand likewise a single tower near Cologne.\r\n\r\n2. After having taken possession of Cologne he did not leave it till the\r\nFrank kings began, through fear of him, to abate of their fury, when he\r\ncontracted a peace with them likely to be of future advantage to the\r\nrepublic. In the mean time he put the whole city into a state of\r\ncomplete defence.\r\n\r\n3. Then, auguring well from these first-fruits of victory, he departed,\r\npassing through the district of Treves, with the intention of wintering\r\nat Sens, which was a town very suitable for that purpose. When bearing,\r\nso to say, the weight of a world of wars upon his shoulders, he was\r\noccupied by perplexities of various kinds, and among them how to provide\r\nfor establishing in places most exposed to danger the soldiers who had\r\nquitted their former posts; how to defeat the enemies who had conspired\r\ntogether to injure the Roman cause; and further, how to provide supplies\r\nfor the army while employed in so many different quarters.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n§ 1. While he was anxiously revolving these things in his mind, he was\r\nattacked by a numerous force of the enemy, who had conceived a hope of\r\nbeing able to take the town. And they were the more confident of success\r\nbecause, from the information of deserters, they had learnt that he\r\nneither had with him his Scutarii nor his Gentiles, both of which bodies\r\nof troops had been distributed among the different municipal towns in\r\norder that they might be the more easily supplied with provisions.\r\n\r\n2. Therefore after the gates of the city had been barricaded, and the\r\nweakest portions of the walls carefully strengthened, Julian was seen\r\nnight and day on the battlements and ramparts, attended by a band of\r\narmed men, boiling over with anger and gnashing his teeth, because,\r\noften as he wished to sally forth, he was prevented from taking such a\r\nstep by the scantiness of the force which he had with him.\r\n\r\n3. At last, after thirty days, the barbarians retired disappointed,\r\nmurmuring that they had been so vain and weak as to attempt the siege of\r\nsuch a city. It deserves however to be remarked, as a most unworthy\r\ncircumstance, that when Julian was in great personal danger, Marcellus,\r\nthe master of the horse, who was posted in the immediate neighbourhood,\r\nomitted to bring him any assistance, though the danger of the city\r\nitself, even if the prince had not been there, ought to have excited his\r\nendeavours to relieve it from the peril of a siege by so formidable an\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\n4. Being now delivered from this fear, Julian, ever prudent and active,\r\ndirected his anxious thoughts incessantly to the care of providing that,\r\nafter their long labours, his soldiers should have rest, which, however\r\nbrief, might be sufficient to recruit their strength. In addition to the\r\nexhaustion consequent on their toils, they were distressed by the\r\ndeficiency of crops on the land, which through the frequent devastations\r\nto which they had been exposed afforded but little suitable for human\r\nfood.\r\n\r\n5. But these difficulties he likewise surmounted by his ever wakeful\r\ndiligence, and a more confident hope of future success opening itself to\r\nhis mind, he rose with higher spirits to accomplish his other designs.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n§ 1. In the first place (and this is a most difficult task for every\r\none), he imposed on himself a rigid temperance, and maintained it as if\r\nhe had been living under the obligation of the sumptuary laws. These\r\nwere originally brought to Rome from the edicts of Lycurgus and the\r\ntables of laws compiled by Solon, and were for a long time strictly\r\nobserved. When they had become somewhat obsolete, they were\r\nre-established by Sylla, who, guided by the apophthegms of Democritus,\r\nagreed with him that it is Fortune which spreads an ambitious table, but\r\nthat Virtue is content with a sparing one.\r\n\r\n2. And likewise Cato of Tusculum, who from his pure and temperate way of\r\nlife obtained the surname of the Censor, said with profound wisdom on\r\nthe same subject, \"When there is great care about food, there is very\r\nlittle care about virtue.\"\r\n\r\n3. Lastly, though he was continually reading the little treatise which\r\nConstantius, when sending him as his step-son to prosecute his studies,\r\nhad written for him with his own hand, in which he made extravagant\r\nprovision for the dinner-expenses of the Cæsar, Julian now forbade\r\npheasants, or sausages, or even sow's udder to be served up to him,\r\ncontenting himself with the cheap and ordinary food of the common\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\n4. Hereupon arose his custom of dividing his nights into three portions,\r\none of which he allotted to rest, one to the affairs of the state, and\r\none to the study of literature; and we read that Alexander the Great had\r\nbeen accustomed to do the same, though he practised the rule with less\r\nself-reliance. For Alexander, having placed a brazen shell on the ground\r\nbeneath him, used to hold a silver ball in his hand, which he kept\r\nstretched outside his bed, so that when sleep pervading his whole body\r\nhad relaxed the rigour of his muscles, the rattling of the ball falling\r\nmight banish slumber from his eyes.\r\n\r\n5. But Julian, without any instrument, awoke whenever he pleased; and\r\nalways rising when the night was but half spent, and that not from a bed\r\nof feathers, or silken coverlets shining with varied brilliancy, but\r\nfrom a rough blanket or rug, would secretly offer his supplications to\r\nMercury, who, as the theological lessons which he had received had\r\ntaught him, was the swift intelligence of the world, exciting the\r\ndifferent emotions of the mind. And thus removed from all external\r\ncircumstances calculated to distract his attention, he gave his whole\r\nattention to the affairs of the republic.\r\n\r\n6. Then, after having ended this arduous and important business, he\r\nturned and applied himself to the cultivation of his intellect. And it\r\nwas marvellous with what excessive ardour he investigated and attained\r\nto the sublime knowledge of the loftiest matters, and how, seeking as it\r\nwere some food for his mind which might give it strength to climb up to\r\nthe sublimest truths, he ran through every branch of philosophy in\r\nprofound and subtle discussions.\r\n\r\n7. Nevertheless, while engaged in amassing knowledge of this kind in\r\nall its fullness and power, he did not despise the humbler\r\naccomplishments. He was tolerably fond of poetry and rhetoric, as is\r\nshown by the invariable and pure elegance, mingled with dignity, of all\r\nhis speeches and letters. And he likewise studied the varied history of\r\nour own state and of foreign countries. To all these accomplishments was\r\nadded a very tolerable degree of eloquence in the Latin language.\r\n\r\n8. Therefore, if it be true, as many writers affirm, that Cyrus the\r\nking, and Simonides the lyric poet, and Hippias of Elis, the most acute\r\nof the Sophists, excelled as they did in memory because they had\r\nobtained that faculty through drinking a particular medicine, we must\r\nalso believe that Julian in his early manhood had drunk the whole cask\r\nof memory, if such a thing could ever be found. And these are the\r\nnocturnal signs of his chastity and virtue.\r\n\r\n9. But as for the manner in which he passed his days, whether in\r\nconversing with eloquence and wit, or in making preparations for war, or\r\nin actual conflict of battle, or in his administration of affairs of the\r\nstate, correcting all defects with magnanimity and liberality, these\r\nthings shall all be set forth in their proper place.\r\n\r\n10. When he was compelled, as being a prince, to apply himself to the\r\nstudy of military discipline, having been previously confined to lessons\r\nof philosophy, and when he was learning the art of marching in time\r\nwhile the pipes were playing the Pyrrhic air, he often, calling upon the\r\nname of Plato, ironically quoted that old proverb, \"A pack-saddle is\r\nplaced on an ox; this is clearly a burden which does not belong to me.\"\r\n\r\n11. On one occasion, when some secretaries were introduced into the\r\ncouncil-chamber, with solemn ceremony, to receive some gold, one of\r\ntheir company did not, as is the usual custom, open his robe to receive\r\nit, but took it in the hollow of both his hands joined together; on\r\nwhich Julian said, secretaries only know how to seize things, not how to\r\naccept them.\r\n\r\n12. Having been approached by the parents of a virgin who had been\r\nravished, seeking for justice, he gave sentence that the ravisher, on\r\nconviction, should be banished; and when the parents complained of this\r\nsentence as unequal to the crime, because the criminal had not been\r\ncondemned to death, he replied, \"Let the laws blame my clemency: but it\r\nis fitting that an emperor of a most merciful disposition should be\r\nsuperior to all other laws.\"\r\n\r\n13. Once when he was about to set forth on an expedition, he was\r\ninterrupted by several people complaining of injuries which they had\r\nreceived, whom he referred for a hearing to the governors of their\r\nrespective provinces. And after he had returned, he inquired what had\r\nbeen done in each case, and with genuine clemency mitigated the\r\npunishments which had been assigned to the offences.\r\n\r\n14. Last of all, without here making any mention of the victories in\r\nwhich he repeatedly defeated the barbarians, and the vigilance with\r\nwhich he protected his army from all harm, the benefits which he\r\nconferred on the Galli, previously exhausted by extreme want, are most\r\nespecially evident from this fact, that when he first entered the\r\ncountry he found that four-and-twenty pieces of gold were exacted, under\r\nthe name of tribute, in the way of poll-tax, from each individual. But\r\nwhen he quitted the country seven pieces only were required, which made\r\nup all the payments due from them to the state. On which account they\r\nrejoiced with festivals and dances, looking upon him as a serene sun\r\nwhich had shone upon them after melancholy darkness.\r\n\r\n15. Moreover we know that up to the very end of his reign and of his\r\nlife, he carefully and with great benefit observed this rule, not to\r\nremit the arrears of tribute by edicts which they call indulgences. For\r\nhe knew that by such conduct he should be giving something to the rich,\r\nwhilst it is notorious everywhere that, the moment that taxes are\r\nimposed, the poor are compelled to pay them all at once without any\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\n16. But while he was thus regulating and governing the country in a\r\nmanner deserving the imitation of all virtuous princes, the rage of the\r\nbarbarians again broke out more violently than ever.\r\n\r\n17. And as wild beasts, which, owing to the carelessness of the\r\nshepherds, have been wont to plunder their flocks, even when these\r\ncareless keepers are exchanged for more watchful ones, still cling to\r\ntheir habit, and being furious with hunger, will, without any regard for\r\ntheir own safety, again attack the flocks and herds; so also the\r\nbarbarians, having consumed all their plunder, continued, under the\r\npressure of hunger, repeatedly to make inroads for the sake of booty,\r\nthough sometimes they died of want before they could obtain any.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n§ 1. These were the events which took place in Gaul during this year; at\r\nfirst of doubtful issue, but in the end successful. Meanwhile in the\r\nemperor's court envy constantly assailed Arbetio, accusing him of having\r\nalready assumed the ensigns of imperial rank, as if designing soon to\r\nattain the supreme dignity itself. And especially was he attacked by a\r\ncount named Verissimus, who with great vehemence brought forth terrible\r\ncharges against him, openly alleging that although he had been raised\r\nfrom the rank of a common soldier to high military office, he was not\r\ncontented, thinking little of what he had obtained, and aiming at the\r\nhighest place.\r\n\r\n2. And he was also vigorously attacked by a man named Dorus, who had\r\nformerly been surgeon of the Scutarii, and of whom we have spoken, when\r\npromoted in the time of Magnentius to be inspector of the works of art\r\nat Rome, as having brought accusations against Adelphius, the prefect of\r\nthe city, as forming ambitious designs.\r\n\r\n3. And when the matter was brought forward for judicial inquiry, and all\r\npreliminary arrangements were made, proof of the accusations which had\r\nbeen confidently looked for was still delayed; when suddenly, as if the\r\nbusiness had been meant as a satire on the administration of justice,\r\nthrough the interposition of the chamberlain as rumour affirmed, the\r\npersons who had been imprisoned as accomplices were released from their\r\nconfinement: Dorus disappeared, and Verissimus kept silence for the\r\nfuture, as if the curtain had dropped and the scene had been suddenly\r\nchanged.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. About the same time, Constantius having learnt, from common report,\r\nthat Marcellus had omitted to carry assistance to the Cæsar when he was\r\nbesieged at Sens, cashiered him, and ordered him to retire to his own\r\nhouse. And he, as if he had received a great injury, began to plot\r\nagainst Julian, relying upon the disposition of the emperor to open his\r\nears to every accusation.\r\n\r\n2. Therefore, when he departed, Eutherius, the chief chamberlain, was\r\nimmediately sent after him, that he might convict him before the emperor\r\nif he propagated any falsehoods. But Marcellus, unaware of this, as soon\r\nas he arrived at Milan, began talking loudly, and seeking to create\r\nalarm, like a vain chatterer half mad as he was. And when he was\r\nadmitted into the council-chamber, he began to accuse Julian of being\r\ninsolent, and of preparing for himself stronger wings in order to soar\r\nto a greater height. For this was his expression, agitating his body\r\nviolently as he uttered it.\r\n\r\n3. While he was thus uttering his imaginary charges with great freedom,\r\nEutherius being, at his own request, introduced into the presence, and\r\nbeing commanded to say what he wished, speaking with great respect and\r\nmoderation showed the emperor that the truth was being overlaid with\r\nfalsehood. For that, while the commander of the heavy-armed troops had,\r\nas it was believed, held back on purpose, the Cæsar having been long\r\nbesieged at Sens, had by his vigilance and energy repelled the\r\nbarbarians. And he pledged his own life that the Cæsar would, as long as\r\nhe lived, be faithful to the author of his greatness.\r\n\r\n4. The opportunity reminds me here to mention a few facts concerning\r\nthis same Eutherius, which perhaps will hardly be believed; because if\r\nNuma Pompilius or Socrates were to say anything good of a eunuch, and\r\nwere to confirm what they said by an oath, they would be accused of\r\nhaving departed from the truth. But roses grow up among thorns, and\r\namong wild beasts some are of gentle disposition. And therefore I will\r\nbriefly mention a few of his most important acts which are well\r\nascertained.\r\n\r\n5. He was born in Armenia, of a respectable family, and having while a\r\nvery little child been taken prisoner by the enemies on the border, he\r\nwas castrated and sold to some Roman merchants, and by them conducted to\r\nthe palace of Constantine, where, while growing up to manhood, he began\r\nto display good principles and good talents, becoming accomplished in\r\nliterature to a degree quite sufficient for his fortune, displaying\r\nextraordinary acuteness in discovering matters of a doubtful and\r\ndifficult complexion; being remarkable also for a marvellous memory,\r\nalways eager to do good, and full of wise and honest counsel. A man, in\r\nshort, who, if the Emperor Constantius had listened to his advice,\r\nwhich, whether he gave it in youth or manhood, was always honourable and\r\nupright, would have been prevented from committing any errors, or at\r\nleast any that were not pardonable.\r\n\r\n6. When he became high chamberlain he sometimes also found fault even\r\nwith Julian, who, as being tainted with Asiatic manners, was apt to be\r\ncapricious. Finally, when he quitted office for private life, and again\r\nwhen he was recalled to court, he was always sober and consistent,\r\ncultivating those excellent virtues of good faith and constancy to such\r\na degree that he never betrayed any secret, except for the purpose of\r\nsecuring another's safety; nor was he ever accused of covetous or\r\ngrasping conduct, as the other courtiers were.\r\n\r\n7. From which it arose that, when at a late period he retired to Rome,\r\nand fixed there the abode of his old age, bearing with him the company\r\nof a good conscience, he was loved and respected by men of all ranks,\r\nthough men of that class generally, after having amassed riches by\r\niniquity, love to seek secret places of retirement, just as owls or\r\nmoths, and avoid the sight of the multitude whom they have injured.\r\n\r\n8. Though I have often ransacked the accounts of antiquity, I do not\r\nfind any ancient eunuch to whom I can compare him. There were indeed\r\namong the ancients some, though very few, faithful and economical, but\r\nstill they were stained by some vice or other; and among the chief\r\nfaults which they had either by nature or habit, they were apt to be\r\neither rapacious or else boorish, and on that account contemptible; or\r\nelse ill-natured and mischievous; or fawning too much on the powerful;\r\nor too elated with power, and therefore arrogant. But of any one so\r\nuniversally accomplished and prudent, I confess I have neither ever read\r\nnor heard, relying for the truth of this judgment on the general\r\ntestimony of the age.\r\n\r\n9. But if any careful reader of ancient histories should oppose to us\r\nMenophilus, the eunuch of King Mithridates, I would warn him to\r\nrecollect that nothing is really known of him except this single fact,\r\nthat he behaved gloriously in a moment of extreme danger.\r\n\r\n10. When the king above mentioned, having been defeated by the Romans\r\nunder the command of Pompey, and fleeing to his kingdom of Colchis, left\r\na grown-up daughter, named Drypetina, who at the time was dangerously\r\nill, in the castle of Synhorium, under the care of this Menophilus, he\r\ncompletely cured the maiden by a variety of remedies, and preserved her\r\nin safety for her father; and when the fortress in which they were\r\nenclosed began to be besieged by Manlius Priscus, the lieutenant of the\r\ngeneral, and when he became aware that the garrison were proposing to\r\nsurrender, he, fearing that, to the dishonour of her father, this noble\r\ndamsel might be made a prisoner and be ravished, slew her, and then fell\r\nupon his sword himself. Now I will return to the point from which I\r\ndigressed.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. After Marcellus had been foiled, as I have mentioned, and had\r\nreturned to Serdica, which was his native place, many great crimes were\r\nperpetrated in the camp of Augustus, under pretence of upholding the\r\nmajesty of the emperor.\r\n\r\n2. For if any one had consulted any cunning soothsayer about the squeak\r\nof a mouse, or the appearance of a weasel, or any other similar portent,\r\nor had used any old woman's chants to assuage any pain--a practice which\r\nthe authority of medicine does not always prohibit--such a man was at\r\nonce informed against, without being able to conceive by whom, and was\r\nbrought before a court of law, and at once condemned to death.\r\n\r\n3. About the same time an individual named Dames was accused by his wife\r\nof certain trifling acts, of which, whether he was innocent or not is\r\nuncertain; but Rufinus was his enemy, who, as we have mentioned, had\r\ngiven information of some matters which had been communicated to him by\r\nGaudentius, the emperor's secretary, causing Africanus, then governing\r\nPannonia with the rank of a consul, to be put to death, with all his\r\nfriends. This Rufinus was now, for his devotion to the interests of the\r\nemperor, the chief commander of the prætorian guard.\r\n\r\n4. He, being given to talking in a boastful manner, after having\r\nseduced that easily deluded woman (the wife of Dames) into an illicit\r\nconnection with him, allured her into a perilous fraud, and persuaded\r\nher by an accumulation of lies to accuse her innocent husband of\r\ntreason, and to invent a story that he had stolen a purple garment from\r\nthe sepulchre of Diocletian, and, by the help of some accomplices, still\r\nkept it concealed.\r\n\r\n5. When this story had been thus devised in a way to cause the\r\ndestruction of many persons, Rufinus himself, full of hopes of some\r\nadvantage, hastened to the camp of the emperor, to spread his customary\r\ncalumnies. And when the transaction had been divulged, Manlius, at that\r\ntime the commander of the prætorian camp, a man of admirable integrity,\r\nreceived orders to make a strict inquiry into the charge, having united\r\nto him, as a colleague in the examination, Ursulus, the chief paymaster,\r\na man likewise of praiseworthy equity and strictness.\r\n\r\n6. There, after the matter had been rigorously investigated according to\r\nthe fashion of that period, and when, after many persons had been put to\r\nthe torture, nothing was found out, and the judges were in doubt and\r\nperplexity; at length truth, long suppressed, found a respite, and,\r\nunder the compulsion of a rigorous examination, the woman confessed that\r\nRufinus was the author of the whole plot, nor did she even conceal the\r\nfact of her adultery with him. Reference was immediately made to the\r\nlaw, and as order and justice required, the judges condemned them both\r\nto death.\r\n\r\n7. But as soon as this was known, Constantius became greatly enraged,\r\nand lamenting Rufinus as if the champion of his safety had been\r\ndestroyed, he sent couriers on horseback express, with threatening\r\norders to Ursulus, commanding him to return to court. Ursulus,\r\ndisregarding the remonstrances of those who advised him to disobey,\r\nhastened fearlessly to the presence; and having entered the emperor's\r\ncouncil-chambers, with undaunted heart and voice related the whole\r\ntransaction; and this confident behaviour of his shut the mouths of the\r\nflatterers, and delivered both the prefect and himself from serious\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\n8. It was at this time also that an event took place in Aquitania which\r\nwas more extensively talked about. A certain cunning person being\r\ninvited to a splendid and sumptuous banquet, which are frequent in that\r\nprovince, having seen a pair of coverlets, with two purple borders of\r\nsuch width, that by the skill of those who waited they seemed to be but\r\none; and beholding the table also covered with a similar cloth, he took\r\nup one in each hand, and arranged them so as to resemble the front of a\r\ncloak, representing them as having formed the ornament of the imperial\r\nrobe; and then searching over the whole house in order to find the robe\r\nwhich he affirmed must be hidden there, he thus caused the ruin of a\r\nwealthy estate.\r\n\r\n9. With similar malignity, a certain secretary in Spain, who was\r\nlikewise invited to a supper, hearing the servants, while bringing in\r\nthe evening candles, cry \"let us conquer,\" affixing a malignant\r\ninterpretation to that common exclamation, in like manner ruined a noble\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n10. These and other evils increasing more and more, because Constantius,\r\nbeing a man of a very timorous disposition, was always thinking that\r\nblows were being aimed at him, like the celebrated tyrant of Sicily,\r\nDionysius, who, because of this vice of his, taught his daughters to\r\nshave him, in order that he might not have to put his face in a\r\nstranger's power; and surrounded the small chamber in which he was\r\naccustomed to sleep with a deep ditch, so placed that it could only be\r\nentered by a drawbridge; the loose beams and axles of which when he went\r\nto bed he removed into his own chamber, replacing them when about to go\r\nforth at daybreak.\r\n\r\n11. Moreover, those who had influence in the court promoted the spread\r\nof these evils, with the hope of joining to their own estates the\r\nforfeited possessions of those who should be condemned; and thus\r\nbecoming rich by the ruin of their neighbours.\r\n\r\n12. For, as clear evidence has shown, if Constantine was the first to\r\nexcite the appetites of his followers, Constantius was the prince who\r\nfattened them on the marrow of the provinces.\r\n\r\n13. For under him the principal persons of every rank burnt with an\r\ninsatiable desire of riches, without any regard for justice or right.\r\nAnd among the ordinary judges, Rufinus, the chief prefect of the\r\nprætorium, was conspicuous for this avarice. And among the military\r\nofficers Arbetio, the master of the horse, and Eusebius, the high\r\nchamberlain, ... Ard ... anus, the quæstor, and in the city, the two\r\nAnicii, whose posterity, treading in the steps of their fathers, could\r\nnot be satisfied even with possessions much larger than they themselves\r\nhad enjoyed.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\n§ 1. But in the East, the Persians now practising predatory inroads and\r\nforays, in preference to engaging in pitched battles, as they had been\r\nwont to do before, carried off continually great numbers of men and\r\ncattle: sometimes making great booty, owing to the unexpectedness of\r\ntheir incursions, but at other times being overpowered by superior\r\nnumbers, they suffered losses. Sometimes, also, the inhabitants of the\r\ndistricts which they had invaded had removed everything which could be\r\ncarried off.\r\n\r\n2. But Musonianus, the prefect of the prætorium, a man, as we have\r\nalready said, of many liberal accomplishments but corrupt, and a person\r\neasily turned from the truth by a bribe, acquired, by means of some\r\nemissaries who were skilful in deceiving and obtaining information, a\r\nknowledge of the plans of the Persians; taking to his counsels on this\r\nsubject Cassianus, duke of Mesopotamia, a veteran who had served many\r\ncampaigns, and had become hardened by all kinds of dangers.\r\n\r\n3. And when, by the concurrent report of spies, these officers had\r\nbecome certain that Sapor was occupied in the most remote frontier of\r\nhis kingdom in repelling the hostilities of the bordering tribes, which\r\nhe could not accomplish without great difficulty and bloodshed, they\r\nsought to tamper with Tamsapor, the general in command in the district\r\nnearest our border. Accordingly they sent soldiers of no renown to\r\nconfer with him secretly, to engage him, if opportunity served, to write\r\nto the king to persuade him to make peace with the Roman emperor;\r\nwhereby he, being then secure on every side, might be the better able to\r\nsubdue the rebels who were never weary of exciting disturbances.\r\n\r\n4. Tamsapor coincided with these wishes, and, trusting to them, reported\r\nto the king that Constantius, being involved in very formidable wars,\r\nwas a suppliant for peace. But it took a long time for these letters to\r\nreach the country of the Chionites and the Euseni, on whose borders\r\nSapor had taken up his winter quarters.\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\n§ 1. While matters were thus proceeding in the eastern regions and in\r\nthe Gauls, Constantius, as if the temple of Janus were now shut and\r\nhostilities everywhere at an end, became desirous of visiting Rome, with\r\nthe intention of celebrating his triumph over Magnentius, to which he\r\ncould give no name, since the blood that he had spilt was that of Roman\r\nfoes.\r\n\r\n2. For indeed, neither by his own exertions, nor by those of his\r\ngenerals did he ever conquer any nation that made war upon him; nor did\r\nhe make any additions to the empire; nor at critical moments was he ever\r\nseen to be the foremost or even among the foremost; but still he was\r\neager to exhibit to the people, now in the enjoyment of peace, a vast\r\nprocession, and standards heavy with gold, and a splendid train of\r\nguards and followers, though the citizens themselves neither expected\r\nnor desired any such spectacle.\r\n\r\n3. He was ignorant, probably, that some of the ancient emperors were, in\r\ntime of peace, contented with their lictors, and that when the ardour of\r\nwar forbade all inactivity, one,[61] in a violent storm, had trusted\r\nhimself to a fisherman's boat; another,[62] following the example of the\r\nDecii, had sacrificed his life for the safety of the republic;\r\nanother[63] had by himself, accompanied by only a few soldiers of the\r\nlowest rank, gone as a spy into the camp of the enemy: in short, that\r\nmany of them had rendered themselves illustrious by splendid exploits,\r\nin order to hand down to posterity a glorious memory of themselves,\r\nearned by their achievements.\r\n\r\n4. Accordingly, after long and sumptuous preparation, ... in the second\r\nprefecture of Orfitus, Constantius, elated with his great honours, and\r\nescorted by a formidable array of troops, marching in order of battle,\r\npassed through Ocricoli, attracting towards himself the astonished gaze\r\nof all the citizens.\r\n\r\n5. And when he drew near to the city, contemplating the salutations\r\noffered him by the senators, and the whole body of fathers venerable\r\nfrom their likeness to their ancestors, he thought, not like Cineas, the\r\nambassador of Pyrrhus, that a multitude of kings was here assembled\r\ntogether, but that the city was the asylum of the whole world.\r\n\r\n6. And when from them he had turned his eyes upon the citizens, he\r\nmarvelled to think with what rapidity the whole race of mankind upon\r\nearth had come from all quarters to Rome; and, as if he would have\r\nterrified the Euphrates or the Rhine with a show of armed men, he\r\nhimself came on, preceded by standards on both sides, sitting alone in a\r\ngolden chariot, shining with all kinds of brilliant precious stones,\r\nwhich seemed to spread a flickering light all around.\r\n\r\n7. Numbers also of the chief officers who went before him were\r\nsurrounded by dragons embroidered on various kinds of tissue, fastened\r\nto the golden or jewelled points of spears, the mouths of the dragons\r\nbeing open so as to catch the wind, which made them hiss as though they\r\nwere inflamed with anger; while the coils of their tails were also\r\ncontrived to be agitated by the breeze.\r\n\r\n8. After these marched a double row of heavy-armed soldiers, with\r\nshields and crested helmets, glittering with brilliant light, and clad\r\nin radiant breastplates; and among these were scattered cavalry with\r\ncuirasses, whom the Persians call Clibanarii,[64] protected by coverings\r\nof iron breastplates, and girdled with belts of iron, so that you would\r\nfancy them statues polished by the hand of Praxiteles, rather than men.\r\nAnd the light circular plates of iron which surrounded their bodies, and\r\ncovered all their limbs, were so well fitted to all their motions, that\r\nin whatever direction they had occasion to move, the joints of their\r\niron clothing adapted themselves equally to any position.\r\n\r\n9. The emperor as he proceeded was saluted as Augustus by voices of good\r\nomen, the mountains and shores re-echoing the shouts of the people, amid\r\nwhich he preserved the same immovable countenance which he was\r\naccustomed to display in his provinces.\r\n\r\n10. For though he was very short, yet he bowed down when entering high\r\ngates, and looking straight before him, as though he had had his neck in\r\na vice, he turned his eyes neither to the right nor to the left, as if\r\nhe had been a statue: nor when the carriage shook him did he nod his\r\nhead, or spit, or rub his face or his nose; nor was he ever seen even to\r\nmove a hand.\r\n\r\n11. And although this calmness was affectation, yet these and other\r\nportions of his inner life were indicative of a most extraordinary\r\npatience, as it may be thought, granted to him alone.\r\n\r\n12. I pass over the circumstance that during the whole of his reign he\r\nnever either took up any one to sit with him in his chariot, or admitted\r\nany private person to be his partner in the consulship, as other\r\nemperors had done; also many other things which he, being filled with\r\nelation and pride, prescribed to himself as the justest of all rules of\r\nconduct, recollecting that I mentioned those facts before, as occasion\r\nserved.\r\n\r\n13. As he went on, having entered Rome, that home of sovereignty and of\r\nall virtues, when he arrived at the rostra, he gazed with amazed awe on\r\nthe Forum, the most renowned monument of ancient power; and, being\r\nbewildered with the number of wonders on every side to which he turned\r\nhis eyes, having addressed the nobles in the senate-house, and harangued\r\nthe populace from the tribune, he retired, with the good-will of all,\r\ninto his palace, where he enjoyed the luxury he had wished for. And\r\noften, when celebrating the equestrian games, was he delighted with the\r\ntalkativeness of the common people, who were neither proud, nor, on the\r\nother hand, inclined to become rebellious from too much liberty, while\r\nhe himself also reverently observed a proper moderation.\r\n\r\n14. For he did not, as was usually done in other cities, allow the\r\nlength of the gladiatorial contests to depend on his caprice; but left\r\nit to be decided by various occurrences. Then, traversing the summits of\r\nthe seven hills, and the different quarters of the city, whether placed\r\non the slopes of the hills or on the level ground, and visiting, too,\r\nthe suburban divisions, he was so delighted that whatever he saw first\r\nhe thought the most excellent of all. Admiring the temple of the\r\nTarpeian Jupiter, which is as much superior to other temples as divine\r\nthings are superior to those of men; and the baths of the size of\r\nprovinces; and the vast mass of the amphitheatre, so solidly erected of\r\nTibertine stone, to the top of which human vision can scarcely reach;\r\nand the Pantheon with its vast extent, its imposing height, and the\r\nsolid magnificence of its arches, and the lofty niches rising one above\r\nanother like stairs, adorned with the images of former emperors; and the\r\ntemple of the city, and the forum of peace, and the theatre of Pompey,\r\nand the odeum, and the racecourse, and the other ornaments of the\r\nEternal City.\r\n\r\n15. But when he came to the forum of Trajan, the most exquisite\r\nstructure, in my opinion, under the canopy of heaven, and admired even\r\nby the deities themselves, he stood transfixed with wonder, casting his\r\nmind over the gigantic proportions of the place, beyond the power of\r\nmortal to describe, and beyond the reasonable desire of mortals to\r\nrival. Therefore giving up all hopes of attempting anything of this\r\nkind, he contented himself with saying that he should wish to imitate,\r\nand could imitate the horse of Trajan, which stands by itself in the\r\nmiddle of the hall, bearing the emperor himself on his back.\r\n\r\n16. And the royal prince Hormisdas, whose departure from Persia we have\r\nalready mentioned, standing by answered, with the refinement of his\r\nnature, \"But first, O emperor, command such a stable to be built for\r\nhim, if you can, that the horse which you purpose to make may have as\r\nfair a domain as this which we see.\" And when he was asked what he\r\nthought of Rome, he said that \"he was particularly delighted with it\r\nbecause he had learnt that men died also there.\"\r\n\r\n17. Now after he had beheld all these various objects with awful\r\nadmiration, the emperor complained of fame, as either deficient in\r\npower, or else spiteful, because, though it usually exaggerates\r\neverything, it fell very short in its praises of the things which are\r\nat Rome; and having deliberated for some time what he should do, he\r\ndetermined to add to the ornaments of the city by erecting an obelisk in\r\nthe Circus Maximus, the origin and form of which I will describe when I\r\ncome to the proper place.\r\n\r\n18. At this time Eusebia, the queen, who herself was barren all her\r\nlife, began to plot against Helena, the sister of Constantius, and wife\r\nof the Cæsar Julian, whom she had induced to come to Rome under a\r\npretence of affection, and by wicked machinations she induced her to\r\ndrink a poison which she had procured, which should have the effect,\r\nwhenever Helena conceived, of producing abortion.\r\n\r\n19. For already, when in Gaul, she had borne a male child, but that also\r\nhad been dishonestly destroyed because the midwife, having been bribed,\r\nkilled it as soon as it was born, by cutting through the navel-string\r\ntoo deeply; such exceeding care was taken that this most gallant man\r\nshould have no offspring.\r\n\r\n20. But the emperor, while wishing to remain longer in this most august\r\nspot of the whole world, in order to enjoy a purer tranquillity and\r\nhigher degree of pleasure, was alarmed by repeated intelligence on which\r\nhe could rely, which informed him that the Suevi were invading the\r\nTyrol, that the Quadi were ravaging Valeria,[65] and that the\r\nSarmatians, a tribe most skilful in plunder, were laying waste the upper\r\nMoesia, and the second Pannonia. And roused by these news, on the\r\nthirtieth day after he had entered Rome, he again quitted it, leaving it\r\non the 29th of May, and passing through Trent he proceeded with all\r\nhaste towards Illyricum.\r\n\r\n21. And from that city he sent Severus to succeed Marcellus, a man of\r\ngreat experience and ripe skill in war, and summoned Ursicinus to\r\nhimself. He, having gladly received the letter of summons, came to\r\nSirmium, with a large retinue, and after a long deliberation on the\r\npeace which Musonianus had reported as possible to be made with the\r\nPersians, he was sent back to the East with the authority of\r\ncommander-in-chief, and the older officers of our company having been\r\npromoted to commands over the soldiers, we younger men were ordered to\r\nfollow him to perform whatever he commanded us for the service of the\r\nrepublic.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\nA.D. 357.\r\n\r\n§ 1. But Julian, having passed his winter at Sens, amid continual\r\ndisturbance, in the ninth consulship of the emperor, and his own second,\r\nwhile the threats of the Germans were raging on all sides, being roused\r\nby favourable omens, marched with speed to Rheims, with the greater\r\nalacrity and joy because Severus was in command of the army there; a man\r\ninclined to agree with him, void of arrogance, but of proved propriety\r\nof conduct and experience in war, and likely to follow his lawful\r\nauthority, obeying his general like a well-disciplined soldier.\r\n\r\n2. In another quarter, Barbatio, who after the death of Silvanus had\r\nbeen promoted to the command of the infantry, came from Italy by the\r\nemperor's orders, to Augst, with 25,000 heavy-armed soldiers.\r\n\r\n3. For the plan proposed and very anxiously prepared was, that the\r\nAllemanni, who were in a state of greater rage than ever, and were\r\nextending their incursions more widely, should be caught between our two\r\narmies, as if between the arms of a pair of pincers, and so driven into\r\na corner and destroyed.\r\n\r\n4. But while these well-devised plans were being pressed forward, the\r\nbarbarians, in joy at some success which they had obtained, and skilful\r\nin seizing every opportunity for plunder, passed secretly between the\r\ncamps of the armies, and attacked Lyons unexpectedly. And having\r\nplundered the district around, they would have stormed and burnt the\r\ncity itself, if they had not found the gates so strongly defended that\r\nthey were repulsed; so that they only destroyed all they could find\r\noutside the city.\r\n\r\n5. When this disaster was known, Cæsar, with great alacrity, despatched\r\nthree squadrons of light cavalry, of approved valour, to watch three\r\nlines of road, knowing that beyond all question the invaders must quit\r\nthe district by one of them.\r\n\r\n6. Nor was he mistaken; for all who came by these roads were\r\nslaughtered by our men, and the whole of the booty which they were\r\ncarrying off was recovered unhurt. Those alone escaped in safety who\r\npassed by the camp of Barbatio, who were suffered to escape in that\r\ndirection because Bainobaudes the tribune, and Valentinian (afterwards\r\nemperor), who had been appointed to watch that pass with the squadrons\r\nof cavalry under their orders, were forbidden by Cella (the tribune of\r\nthe Scutarii, who had been sent as colleague to Barbatio) to occupy that\r\nroad, though they were sure that by that the Germans would return to\r\ntheir own country.\r\n\r\n7. The cowardly master of the horse, being also an obstinate enemy to\r\nthe glory of Julian, was not contented with this, but being conscious\r\nthat he had given orders inconsistent with the interests of Rome (for\r\nwhen he was accused of it Cella confessed what he had done), he made a\r\nfalse report to Constantius, and told him that these same tribunes had,\r\nunder a pretence of the business of the state, came thither for the\r\npurpose of tampering with the soldiers whom he commanded. And owing to\r\nthis statement they were deprived of their commands, and returned home\r\nas private individuals.\r\n\r\n8. In these days, also, the barbarians, alarmed at the approach of our\r\narmies, which had established their stations on the left bank of the\r\nRhine, employed some part of their force in skilfully barricading the\r\nroads, naturally difficult of access, and full of hills, by abattis\r\nconstructed of large trees cut down; others occupied the numerous\r\nislands scattered up and down the Rhone, and with horrid howls poured\r\nforth constant reproaches against the Romans and the Cæsar; who, being\r\nnow more than ever resolved to crush some of their armies, demanded from\r\nBarbatio seven of those boats which he had collected, for the purpose of\r\nconstructing a bridge with them, with the intention of crossing the\r\nriver. But Barbatio, determined that no assistance should be got from\r\nhim, burnt them all.\r\n\r\n9. Julian, therefore, having learnt from the report of some spies whom\r\nhe had lately taken prisoners, that, when the drought of summer arrived,\r\nthe river was fordable, addressed a speech of encouragement to his\r\nlight-armed auxiliary troops, and sent them forward with Bainobaudes,\r\nthe tribune of the Cornuti, to try and perform some gallant exploit, if\r\nthey could find an opportunity. And they, entering the shallow of the\r\nriver, and sometimes, when there was occasion for swimming, putting\r\ntheir shields under them like canoes, reached a neighbouring island, and\r\nhaving landed, killed every one they found on it, men and women, without\r\ndistinction of age, like so many sheep. And having found some empty\r\nboats, though they were not very safe, they crossed in them, forcing\r\ntheir way into many places of the same land. When they were weary of\r\nslaughter, and loaded with a rich booty, some of which, however, they\r\nlost through the violence of the river, they returned back to the camp\r\nwithout losing a man.\r\n\r\n10. And when this was known, the rest of the Germans, thinking they\r\ncould no longer trust the garrisons left in the islands, removed their\r\nrelations, and their magazines, and their barbaric treasures, into the\r\ninland parts.\r\n\r\n11. After this Julian turned his attention to repair the fortress known\r\nby the name of Saverne, which had a little time before been destroyed by\r\na violent attack of the enemy, but which, while it stood, manifestly\r\nprevented the Germans from forcing their way into the interior of the\r\nGauls, as they had been accustomed to do; and he executed this work with\r\ngreater rapidity than he expected, and he laid up for the garrison which\r\nhe intended to post there sufficient magazines for a whole year's\r\nconsumption, which his army collected from the crops of the barbarians,\r\nnot without occasional contests with the owners.\r\n\r\n12. Nor indeed was he contented with this, but he also collected\r\nprovisions for himself and his army sufficient for twenty days. For the\r\nsoldiers delighted in using the food which they had won with their own\r\nright hands, being especially indignant because, out of all the supplies\r\nwhich had been recently sent them, they were not able to obtain\r\nanything, inasmuch as Barbatio, when they were passing near his camp,\r\nhad with great insolence seized on a portion of them, and had collected\r\nall the rest into a heap and burnt them. Whether he acted thus out of\r\nhis own vanity and insane folly, or whether others were really the\r\nauthors of this wickedness, relying on the command of the emperor\r\nhimself, has never been known.\r\n\r\n13. However, as far as report went, the story commonly was, that Julian\r\nhad been elected Cæsar, not for the object of relieving the distresses\r\nof the Gauls, but rather of being himself destroyed by the formidable\r\nwars in which he was sure to be involved; being at that time, as was\r\nsupposed, inexperienced in war, and not likely to endure even the sound\r\nof arms.\r\n\r\n14. While the works of the camp were steadily rising, and while a\r\nportion of the army was being distributed among the stations in the\r\ncountry districts, Julian occupied himself in other quarters with\r\ncollecting supplies, operating with great caution, from the fear of\r\nambuscades. And in the mean time, a vast host of the barbarians,\r\noutstripping all report of their approach by the celerity of their\r\nmovements, came down with a sudden attack upon Barbatio, and the army\r\nwhich (as I have already mentioned) he had under his command, separated\r\nfrom the Gallic army of Severus only by a rampart; and having put him to\r\nflight, pursued him as far as Augst, and beyond that town too, as far as\r\nthey could; and, having made booty of the greater part of his baggage\r\nand beasts of burden, and having carried off many of the sutlers as\r\nprisoners, they returned to their main army.\r\n\r\n15. And Barbatio, as if he had brought his expectations to a prosperous\r\nissue, now distributed his soldiers into winter quarters, and returned\r\nto the emperor's court, to forge new accusations against the Cæsar,\r\naccording to his custom.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. When this disgraceful disaster had become known, Chnodomarius and\r\nVestralpus, the kings of the Allemanni, and Urius and Ursicinus, with\r\nSerapion, and Suomarius, and Hortarius, having collected all their\r\nforces into one body, encamped near the city of Strasburg, thinking that\r\nthe Cæsar, from fear of imminent danger, had retreated at the very time\r\nthat he was wholly occupied with completing a fortress to enable him to\r\nmake a permanent stand.\r\n\r\n2. Their confidence and assurance of success was increased by one of the\r\nScutarii who deserted to them, who fearing punishment for some offence\r\nwhich he had committed, crossed over to them after the departure of\r\nBarbatio, and assured them that Julian had now only 13,000 men remaining\r\nwith him. For that was the number of troops that he had now with him,\r\nwhile the ferocious barbarians were stirring up attacks upon him from\r\nall sides.\r\n\r\n3. And as he constantly adhered to the same story, they were excited to\r\nmore haughty attempts by the confidence with which he inspired them, and\r\nsent ambassadors in an imperious tone to Cæsar, demanding that he should\r\nretire from the territory which they had acquired by their own valour in\r\narms. But he, a stranger to fear, and not liable to be swayed either by\r\nanger or by disappointment, despised the arrogance of the barbarians,\r\nand detaining the ambassadors till he had completed the works of his\r\ncamp, remained immovable on his ground with admirable constancy.\r\n\r\n4. But King Chnodomarius, moving about in every direction, and being\r\nalways the first to undertake dangerous enterprises, kept everything in\r\ncontinual agitation and confusion, being full of arrogance and pride, as\r\none whose head was turned by repeated success.\r\n\r\n5. For he had defeated the Cæsar Decentius in a pitched battle, and he\r\nhad plundered and destroyed many wealthy cities, and he had long ravaged\r\nall Gaul at his own pleasure without meeting with any resistance. And\r\nhis confidence was now increased by the recent retreat of a general\r\nsuperior to him in the number and strength of his forces.\r\n\r\n6. For the Allemanni, beholding the emblems on their shields, saw that a\r\nfew predatory bands of their men had wrested those districts from those\r\nsoldiers whom they had formerly never engaged but with fear, and by whom\r\nthey had often been routed with much loss. And these circumstances made\r\nJulian very anxious, because, after the defection of Barbatio, he\r\nhimself under the pressure of absolute necessity was compelled to\r\nencounter very populous tribes, with but very few, though brave troops.\r\n\r\n7. And now, the sun being fully risen, the trumpets sounded, and the\r\ninfantry were led forth from the camp in slow march, and on their flanks\r\nwere arrayed the squadrons of cavalry, among which were both the\r\ncuirassiers and the archers, troops whose equipment was very formidable.\r\n\r\n8. And since from the spot from which the Roman standards had first\r\nadvanced to the rampart of the barbarian camp were fourteen leagues,\r\nthat is to say one-and-twenty miles, Cæsar, carefully providing for the\r\nadvantage and safety of his army, called in the skirmishers who had gone\r\nout in front, and having ordered silence in his usual voice, while they\r\nall stood in battalions around him, addressed them in his natural\r\ntranquillity of voice.\r\n\r\n9. \"The necessity of providing for our common safety, to say the least\r\nof it, compels me, and I am no prince of abject spirit, to exhort you,\r\nmy comrades, to rely so much on your own mature and vigorous valour, as\r\nto follow my counsels in adopting a prudent manner of enduring or\r\nrepelling the evils which we anticipate, rather than resort to an\r\noverhasty mode of action which must be doubtful in its issue.\r\n\r\n10. \"For though amid dangers youth ought to be energetic and bold, so\r\nalso in cases of necessity it should show itself manageable and prudent.\r\nNow what I think best to be done, if your opinion accords with mine, and\r\nif your just indignation will endure it, I will briefly explain.\r\n\r\n11. \"Already noon is approaching, we are weary with our march, and if we\r\nadvance we shall enter upon rugged paths where we can hardly see our\r\nway. As the moon is waning the night will not be lighted up by any\r\nstars. The earth is burnt up with the heat, and will afford us no\r\nsupplies of water. And even if by any contrivance we could get over\r\nthese difficulties comfortably, still, when the swarms of the enemy fall\r\nupon us, refreshed as they will be with rest, meat, and drink, what will\r\nbecome of us? What strength will there be in our weary limbs, exhausted\r\nas we shall be with hunger, thirst, and toil, to encounter them?\r\n\r\n12. \"Therefore, since the most critical difficulties are often overcome\r\nby skilful arrangements, and since, after good counsel has been taken in\r\ngood part, divine-looking remedies have often re-established affairs\r\nwhich seemed to be tottering; I entreat you to let us here, surrounded\r\nas we are with fosse and rampart, take our repose, after first\r\nparcelling out our regular watches, and then, having refreshed ourselves\r\nwith sleep and food as well as the time will allow, let us, under the\r\nprotection of God, with the earliest dawn move forth our conquering\r\neagles and standards to reap a certain triumph.\"\r\n\r\n13. The soldiers would hardly allow him to finish his speech, gnashing\r\ntheir teeth, and showing their eagerness for combat by beating their\r\nshields with their spears; and entreating at once to be led against the\r\nenemy already in their sight, relying on the favour of the God of\r\nheaven, and on their own valour, and on the proved courage of their\r\nfortunate general. And, as the result proved, it was a certain kind\r\ngenius that was present with them thus prompting them to fight while\r\nstill under his inspiration.\r\n\r\n14. And this eagerness of theirs was further stimulated by the full\r\napproval of the officers of high rank, and especially of Florentius the\r\nprefect of the prætorian guard, who openly gave his opinion for fighting\r\nat once, while the enemy were in the solid mass in which they were now\r\narranged; admitting the danger indeed, but still thinking it the wisest\r\nplan, because, if the enemy once dispersed, it would be impossible to\r\nrestrain the soldiers, at all times inclined by their natural vehemence\r\nof disposition towards sedition; and they were likely to be, as he\r\nthought, so indignant at being denied the victory they sought, as to be\r\neasily tempted to the most lawless violence.\r\n\r\n15. Two other considerations also added to the confidence of our men.\r\nFirst, because they recollected that in the previous year, when the\r\nRomans spread themselves in every direction over the countries on the\r\nother side of the Rhine, not one of the barbarians stood to defend his\r\nhome, nor ventured to encounter them; but they contented themselves with\r\nblockading the roads in every direction with vast abattis, throughout\r\nthe whole winter retiring into the remote districts, and willingly\r\nendured the greatest hardships rather than fight; recollecting also\r\nthat, after the emperor actually invaded their territories, the\r\nbarbarians neither ventured to make any resistance, nor even to show\r\nthemselves at all, but implored peace in the most suppliant manner, till\r\nthey obtained it.\r\n\r\n16. But no one considered that the times were changed, because the\r\nbarbarians were at that time pressed with a threefold danger. The\r\nemperor hastening against them through the Tyrol, the Cæsar who was\r\nactually in their country cutting off all possibility of retreat, while\r\nthe neighbouring tribes, whom recent quarrels had converted into\r\nenemies, were all but treading on their heels; and thus they were\r\nsurrounded on all sides. But since that time the emperor, having granted\r\nthem peace, had returned to Italy, and the neighbouring tribes, having\r\nall cause of quarrel removed, were again in alliance with them; and the\r\ndisgraceful retreat of one of the Roman generals had increased their\r\nnatural confidence and boldness.\r\n\r\n17. Moreover there was another circumstance which at this crisis added\r\nweight to the difficulties which pressed upon the Romans. The two royal\r\nbrothers, who had obtained peace from Constantius in the preceding year,\r\nbeing bound by the obligations of that treaty, neither ventured to raise\r\nany disturbance, nor indeed to put themselves in motion at all. But a\r\nlittle after the conclusion of that peace one of them whose name was\r\nGundomadus, and who was the most loyal and the most faithful to his\r\nword, was slain by treachery, and then all his tribe joined our enemies;\r\nand on this the tribe of Vadomarius also, against his will, as he\r\naffirmed, ranged itself on the side of the barbarians who were arming\r\nfor war.\r\n\r\n18. Therefore, since all the soldiers of every rank, from the highest to\r\nthe lowest, approved of engaging instantly, and would not relax the\r\nleast from the rigour of their determination, on a sudden the\r\nstandard-bearer shouted out, \"Go forth, O Cæsar, most fortunate of all\r\nprinces. Go whither thy better fortune leads thee. At least we have\r\nlearnt by your example the power of valour and military skill. Go on and\r\nlead us, as a fortunate and gallant champion. You shall see what a\r\nsoldier under the eye of a warlike general, a witness of the exploits of\r\neach individual, can do, and how little, with the favour of the Deity,\r\nany obstacle can avail against him.\"\r\n\r\n19. When these words were heard, without a moment's delay, the whole\r\narmy advanced and approached a hill of moderate height, covered with\r\nripe corn, at no great distance from the banks of the Rhine. On its\r\nsummit were posted three cavalry soldiers of the enemy as scouts, who\r\nat once hastened back to their comrades to announce that the Roman army\r\nwas at hand; but one infantry soldier who was with them, not being able\r\nto keep up with them, was taken prisoner by the activity of some of our\r\nsoldiers, and informed us that the Germans had been passing over the\r\nriver for three days and three nights.\r\n\r\n20. And when our generals beheld them now at no great distance forming\r\ntheir men into solid columns, they halted, and formed all the first\r\nranks of their troops into a similarly solid body, and with equal\r\ncaution the enemy likewise halted.\r\n\r\n21. And when in consequence of this halt, the enemy saw (as the deserter\r\nI mentioned above had informed them) that all our cavalry was ranged\r\nagainst them in our right wing, then they posted all their own cavalry\r\nin close order on their left wing. And with them they mingled every here\r\nand there a few infantry, skirmishers and light-armed soldiers, which\r\nindeed was a very wise manoeuvre.\r\n\r\n22. For they knew that a cavalry soldier, however skilful, if fighting\r\nwith one of our men in complete armour, while his hands were occupied\r\nwith shield and bridle, so that he could use no offensive weapon but the\r\nspear which he brandished in his right hand, could never injure an enemy\r\nwholly covered with iron mail; but that an infantry soldier, amid the\r\nactual struggles of personal conflict, when nothing is usually guarded\r\nagainst by a combatant except that which is straight before him, may\r\ncrawl unperceivedly along the ground, and piercing the side of the Roman\r\nsoldier's horse, throw the rider down headlong, rendering him thus an\r\neasy victim.\r\n\r\n23. When these dispositions had been thus made, the barbarians also\r\nprotected their right flank with secret ambuscades and snares. Now the\r\nwhole of these warlike and savage tribes were on this day under the\r\ncommand of Chnodomarius and Serapio, monarchs of more power than any of\r\ntheir former kings.\r\n\r\n24. Chnodomarius was indeed the wicked instigator of the whole war, and\r\nbearing on his head a helmet blazing like fire, he led on the left wing\r\nwith great boldness, confiding much on his vast personal strength. And\r\nnow with great eagerness for the impending battle he mounted a spirited\r\nhorse, that by the increased height he might be more conspicuous,\r\nleaning upon a spear of most formidable size, and remarkable for the\r\nsplendour of his arms. Being indeed a prince who had on former occasions\r\nshown himself brave as a warrior and a general, eminent for skill above\r\nhis fellows.\r\n\r\n25. The right wing was led by Serapio, a youth whose beard had hardly\r\ngrown, but who was beyond his years in courage and strength. He was the\r\nson of Mederichus the brother of Chnodomarius, a man throughout his\r\nwhole life of the greatest perfidy; and he had received the name of\r\nSerapio because his father, having been given as a hostage, had been\r\ndetained in Gaul for a long time, and had there learnt some of the\r\nmysteries of the Greeks, in consequence of which he had changed the name\r\nof his son, who at his birth was named Agenarichus, into that of\r\nSerapio.\r\n\r\n26. These two leaders were followed by five other kings who were but\r\nlittle inferior in power to themselves, by ten petty princes, a vast\r\nnumber of nobles, and thirty-five thousand armed men, collected from\r\nvarious nations partly by pay, and partly by a promise of requiting\r\ntheir service by similar assistance on a future day.\r\n\r\n27. The trumpets now gave forth a terrible sound; Severus, the Roman\r\ngeneral in command of the left wing, when he came near the ditches\r\nfilled with armed men, from which the enemy had arranged that those who\r\nwere there concealed should suddenly rise up, and throw the Roman line\r\ninto confusion, halted boldly, and suspecting some yet hidden ambuscade,\r\nneither attempted to retreat nor advance.\r\n\r\n28. Seeing this, Julian, always full of courage at the moment of the\r\ngreatest difficulty, galloped with an escort of two hundred cavalry\r\nthrough the ranks of the infantry at full speed, addressing them with\r\nwords of encouragement, as the critical circumstances in which they were\r\nplaced required.\r\n\r\n29. And as the extent of the space over which they were spread and the\r\ndenseness of the multitude thus collected into one body, would not allow\r\nhim to address the whole army (and also because on other accounts he\r\nwished to avoid exposing himself to malice and envy, as well as not to\r\naffect that which Augustus thought belonged exclusively to himself), he,\r\nwhile taking care of himself as he passed within reach of the darts of\r\nthe enemy, encouraged all whom his voice could reach, whether known or\r\nunknown to him, to fight bravely, with these and similar words:--\r\n\r\n30. \"Now, my comrades, the fit time for fighting has arrived; the time\r\nwhich I, as well as you, have long desired, and which you just now\r\ninvited when, with gestures of impatience, you demanded to be led on.\"\r\nAgain, when he came to those in the rear rank, who were posted in\r\nreserve: \"Behold,\" said he, \"my comrades, the long-wished-for day is at\r\nhand, which incites us all to wash out former stains, and to restore to\r\nits proper brightness the Roman majesty. These men before you are\r\nbarbarians, whom their own rage and intemperate madness have urged\r\nforward to meet with the destruction of their fortunes, defeated as they\r\nwill now be by our might.\"\r\n\r\n31. Presently, when making better dispositions for the array of some\r\ntroops who, by long experience in war, had attained to greater skill, he\r\naided his arrangements by these exhortations. \"Let us rise up like brave\r\nmen; let us by our native valour repel the disgrace which has at one\r\ntime been brought upon our arms, from contemplating which it was that\r\nafter much delay I consented to take the name of Cæsar.\"\r\n\r\n32. But to any whom he saw inconsiderately demanding the signal to be\r\ngiven for instant battle, and likely by their rash movements to be\r\ninattentive to orders, he said, \"I entreat you not to be too eager in\r\nyour pursuit of the flying enemy, so as to risk losing the glory of the\r\nvictory which awaits us, and also never to retreat, except under the\r\nlast necessity.\r\n\r\n33. \"For I shall certainly take no care of those who flee. But among\r\nthose who press on to the slaughter of the enemy I shall be present, and\r\nshare with you indiscriminately, provided only that your charge be made\r\nwith moderation and prudence.\"\r\n\r\n34. While repeatedly addressing these and similar exhortations to the\r\ntroops, he drew up the principal part of his army opposite to the front\r\nrank of the barbarians. And suddenly there arose from the Allemanni a\r\ngreat shout, mingled with indignant cries, all exclaiming with one\r\nvoice that the princes ought to leave their horses and fight in the\r\nranks on equal terms with their men, lest if any mischance should occur\r\nthey should avail themselves of the facility of escaping, and leave the\r\nmass of the army in miserable plight.\r\n\r\n35. When this was known, Chnodomarius immediately leapt down from his\r\nhorse, and the rest of the princes followed his example without\r\nhesitation. For indeed none of them doubted but that their side would be\r\nvictorious.\r\n\r\n36. Then the signal for battle being given as usual by the sound of\r\ntrumpets, the armies rushed to the combat with all their force. First of\r\nall javelins were hurled, and the Germans, hastening on with the utmost\r\nimpetuosity, brandishing their javelins in their right hands, dashed\r\namong the squadrons of our cavalry, uttering fearful cries. They had\r\nexcited themselves to more than usual rage; their flowing hair bristling\r\nwith their eagerness, and fury blazing from their eyes. While in\r\nopposition to them our soldiers, standing steadily, protecting their\r\nheads with the bulwark of their shields, and drawing their swords or\r\nbrandishing their javelins, equally threatened death to their\r\nassailants.\r\n\r\n37. And while in the very conflict of battle, the cavalry kept their\r\ngallant squadrons in close order, and the infantry strengthened their\r\nflanks, standing shoulder to shoulder with closely-locked shields,\r\nclouds of thick dust arose, and the battle rocked to and fro, our men\r\nsometimes advancing, sometimes receding. Some of the most powerful\r\nwarriors among the barbarians pressed upon their antagonists with their\r\nknees, trying to throw them down; and in the general excitement men\r\nfought hand to hand, shield pressing upon shield; while the heaven\r\nresounded with the loud cries of the conquerors and of the dying.\r\nPresently, when our left wing, advancing forward, had driven back with\r\nsuperior strength the vast bands of German assailants, and was itself\r\nadvancing with loud cries against the enemy, our cavalry on the right\r\nwing unexpectedly retreated in disorder; but when the leading fugitives\r\ncame upon those in the rear, they halted, perceiving themselves covered\r\nby the legions, and renewed the battle.\r\n\r\n38. This disaster had arisen from the cuirassiers seeing their commander\r\nslightly wounded, and one of their comrades crushed under the weight of\r\nhis own arms, and of his horse, which fell upon him while they were\r\nchanging their position, on which they all fled as each could, and would\r\nhave trampled down the infantry, and thrown everything into confusion,\r\nif the infantry had not steadily kept their ranks and stood immovable,\r\nsupporting each other. Julian, when from a distance he saw his cavalry\r\nthus seeking safety in flight, spurred his horse towards them, and\r\nhimself stopped them like a barrier.\r\n\r\n39. For as he was at once recognized by his purple standard of the\r\ndragon, which was fixed to the top of a long spear, waving its fringe as\r\na real dragon sheds its skin, the tribune of one squadron halted, and\r\nturning pale with alarm, hastened back to renew the battle.\r\n\r\n40. Then, as is customary in critical moments, Julian gently reproached\r\nhis men: \"Whither,\" said he, \"gallant comrades, are ye retreating? Are\r\nye ignorant that flight, which never insures safety, proves the folly of\r\nhaving made a vain attempt? Let us return to our army, to be partakers\r\nof their glory, and not rashly desert those who are fighting for the\r\nrepublic.\"\r\n\r\n41. Saying these words in a dignified tone, he led them all back to\r\ndischarge their duties in the fight, imitating in this the ancient hero\r\nSylla, if we make allowances for the difference of situation. For when\r\nSylla, having led his army against Archelaus, the general of\r\nMithridates, became exhausted by the violence of the conflict, and was\r\ndeserted by all his soldiers, he ran to the foremost rank, and seizing a\r\nstandard he turned it against the enemy, exclaiming, \"Go! ye once chosen\r\ncompanions of my dangers; and when you are asked where I, your general,\r\nwas left, tell them this truth,--alone in Boeotia, fighting for us\r\nall, to his own destruction.\"\r\n\r\n42. The Allemanni, when our cavalry had been thus driven back and thrown\r\ninto confusion, attacked the first line of our infantry, expecting to\r\nfind their spirit abated, and to be able to rout them without much\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\n43. But when they came to close quarters with them, they found they had\r\nmet an equal match. The conflict lasted long; for the Cornuti and\r\nBraccati,[66] veterans of great experience in war, frightening even by\r\ntheir gestures, shouted their battle cry, and the uproar, through the\r\nheat of the conflict, rising up from a gentle murmur, and becoming\r\ngradually louder and louder, grew fierce as that of waves dashing\r\nagainst the rocks; the javelins hissed as they flew hither and thither\r\nthrough the air; the dust rose to the sky in one vast cloud, preventing\r\nall possibility of seeing, and causing arms to fall upon arms, man upon\r\nman.\r\n\r\n44. But the barbarians, in their undisciplined anger and fury, raged\r\nlike the flames; and with ceaseless blows of their swords sought to\r\npierce through the compact mass of the shields with which our soldiers\r\ndefended themselves, as with the testudo.[67]\r\n\r\n45. And when this was seen, the Batavi, with the royal legion, hastened\r\nto the support of their comrades, a formidable band, well able, if\r\nfortune aided them, to save even those who were in the extremest danger.\r\nAnd amid the fierce notes of their trumpets, the battle again raged with\r\nundiminished ferocity.\r\n\r\n46. But the Allemanni, still charging forward impetuously, strove more\r\nand more vigorously, hoping to bear down all opposition by the violence\r\nof their fury. Darts, spears, and javelins never ceased; arrows pointed\r\nwith iron were shot; while at the same time, in hand-to-hand conflict,\r\nsword struck sword, breastplates were cloven, and even the wounded, if\r\nnot quite exhausted with loss of blood, rose up still to deeds of\r\ngreater daring.\r\n\r\n47. In some sense it may be said that the combatants were equal. The\r\nAllemanni were the stronger and the taller men; our soldiers by great\r\npractice were the more skilful. The one were fierce and savage, the\r\nothers composed and wary; the one trusted to their courage, the others\r\nto their physical strength.\r\n\r\n48. Often, indeed, the Roman soldier was beaten down by the weight of\r\nhis enemy's arms, but he constantly rose again; and then, on the other\r\nhand, the barbarian, finding his knees fail under him with fatigue,\r\nwould rest his left knee on the ground, and even in that position\r\nattack his enemy, an act of extreme obstinacy.\r\n\r\n49. Presently there sprang forward with sudden vigour a fiery band of\r\nnobles, among whom also were the princes of the petty tribes, and, as\r\nthe common soldiers followed them in great numbers, they burst through\r\nour lines, and forced a path for themselves up to the principal legion\r\nof the reserve, which was stationed in the centre, in a position called\r\nthe prætorian camp; and there the soldiery, being in closer array, and\r\nin densely serried ranks, stood firm as so many towers, and renewed the\r\nbattle with increased spirit. And intent upon parrying the blows of the\r\nenemy, and covering themselves with their shields as the Mirmillos[68]\r\ndo, with their drawn swords wounded their antagonists in the sides,\r\nwhich their too vehement impetuosity left unprotected.\r\n\r\n50. And thus the barbarians threw away their lives in their struggles\r\nfor victory, while toiling to break the compact array of our battalions.\r\nBut still, in spite of the ceaseless slaughter made among them by the\r\nRomans, whose courage rose with their success, fresh barbarians\r\nsucceeded those who fell; and as the frequent groans of the dying were\r\nheard, many became panic-stricken, and lost all strength.\r\n\r\n51. At last, exhausted by their losses, and having no strength for\r\nanything but flight, they sought to escape with all speed by different\r\nroads, like as sailors and traders, when the sea rages in a storm, are\r\nglad to flee wherever the wind carries them. But any one then present\r\nwill confess that escape was a matter rather to be wished than hoped\r\nfor.\r\n\r\n52. And the merciful protection of a favourable deity was present on our\r\nside, so that our soldiers, now slashing at the backs of the fugitives,\r\nand finding their swords so battered that they were insufficient to\r\nwound, used the enemy's own javelins, and so slew them. Nor could any\r\none of the pursuers satiate himself enough with their blood, nor allow\r\nhis hand to weary with slaughter, nor did any one spare a suppliant out\r\nof pity.\r\n\r\n53. Numbers, therefore, lay on the ground, mortally wounded, imploring\r\ninstant death as a relief; others, half dead with failing breath turned\r\ntheir dying eyes to the last enjoyment of the light. Of some the heads\r\nwere almost cut off by the huge weapons, and merely hung by small strips\r\nto their necks; others, again, who had fallen because the ground had\r\nbeen rendered slippery by the blood of their comrades, without\r\nthemselves receiving any wound, were killed by being smothered in the\r\nmass of those who fell over them.\r\n\r\n54. While these events were proceeding thus prosperously for us, the\r\nconquerors pressed on vigorously, though the edges of their weapons were\r\nblunted by frequent use, and shining helmets and shields were trampled\r\nunder foot. At last, in the extremity of their distress, the barbarians,\r\nfinding the heaps of corpses block up all the paths, sought the aid of\r\nthe river, which was the only hope left to them, and which they had now\r\nreached.\r\n\r\n55. And because our soldiers unweariedly and with great speed pressed,\r\nwith arms in their hands, upon the fleeing bands, many, hoping to be\r\nable to deliver themselves from danger by their skill in swimming,\r\ntrusted their lives to the waves. And Julian, with prompt apprehension,\r\nseeing what would be the result, strictly forbade the tribunes and\r\ncaptains to allow any of our men to pursue them so eagerly as to trust\r\nthemselves to the dangerous currents of the river.\r\n\r\n56. In consequence of which order they halted on the brink, and from it\r\nwounded the Germans with every kind of missile; while, if any of them\r\nescaped from death of that kind by the celerity of their movements, they\r\nstill sunk to the bottom from the weight of their own arms.\r\n\r\n57. And as sometimes in a theatrical spectacle the curtain exhibits\r\nmarvellous figures, so here one could see many strange things in that\r\ndanger; some unconsciously clinging to others who were good swimmers,\r\nothers who were floating were pushed off by those less encumbered as so\r\nmany logs, others again, as if the violence of the stream itself fought\r\nagainst them, were swallowed up in the eddies. Some supported themselves\r\non their shields avoiding the heaviest attacks of the opposing waves by\r\ncrossing them in an oblique direction, and so, after many dangers,\r\nreached the opposite brink, till at last the foaming river, discoloured\r\nwith barbarian blood, was itself amazed at the unusual increase it had\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\n58. And while this was going on, Chnodomarius, the king, finding an\r\nopportunity of escaping, making his way over the heaps of dead with a\r\nsmall escort, hastened with exceeding speed towards the camp which he\r\nhad made near the two Roman fortresses of Alstatt and Lauterbourg, in\r\nthe country of the Tribocci, that he might embark in some boats which\r\nhad already been prepared in case of any emergency, and so escape to\r\nsome secret hiding-place in which he might conceal himself.\r\n\r\n59. And because it was impossible for him to reach his camp without\r\ncrossing the Rhine, he hid his face that he might not be recognized, and\r\nafter that retreated slowly. And when he got near the bank of the river,\r\nas he was feeling his way round a marsh, partly overflowed, seeking some\r\npath by which to cross it, his horse suddenly stumbled in some soft and\r\nsticky place, and he was thrown down, but though he was fat and heavy,\r\nhe without delay reached the shelter of a hill in the neighbourhood;\r\nthere he was recognized (for indeed he could not conceal who he was,\r\nbeing betrayed by the greatness of his former fortune): and immediately\r\na squadron of cavalry came up at full gallop with its tribune, and\r\ncautiously surrounded the wooded mound; though they feared to enter the\r\nthicket lest they should fall into any ambuscade concealed among the\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\n60. But when he saw them he was seized with extreme terror, and of his\r\nown accord came forth by himself and surrendered; and his companions,\r\ntwo hundred in number, and his three most intimate friends, thinking it\r\nwould be a crime in them to survive their king, or not to die for him if\r\noccasion required, gave themselves up also as prisoners.\r\n\r\n61. And, as barbarians are naturally low spirited in adverse fortune,\r\nand very much the reverse in moments of prosperity, so now that he was\r\nin the power of another he became pale and confused, his consciousness\r\nof guilt closing his mouth; widely different from him who lately,\r\ninsulting the ashes of the Gauls with ferocious and lamentable violence,\r\npoured forth savage threats against the whole empire.\r\n\r\n62. Now after these affairs were thus by the favour of the deity brought\r\nto an end, the victorious soldiers were recalled at the close of the\r\nday to their camp by the signal of the trumpeter, and marched towards\r\nthe bank of the Rhine, and there erecting a rampart of shields piled\r\ntogether in several rows, they refreshed themselves with food and sleep.\r\n\r\n63. There fell in this battle, of Romans 243, and four generals:\r\nBainobaudes, the tribune of the Cornuti, and with him Laipso, and\r\nInnocentius, who commanded the cuirassiers and one tribune who had no\r\nparticular command, and whose name I forget. But of the Allemanni, there\r\nwere found 6000 corpses on the field, and incalculable numbers were\r\ncarried down by the waves of the river.\r\n\r\n64. Then Julian, as one who was now manifestly approved by fortune, and\r\nwas also greater in his merit than even in his authority, was by\r\nunanimous acclamation hailed as Augustus by the soldiers; but he sharply\r\nreproved them for so doing, affirming with an oath that he neither\r\nwished for such an honour, nor would accept it.\r\n\r\n65. In order to increase the joy at his recent success, Julian ordered\r\nChnodomarius to be brought before him at his council; who at first\r\nbowing, and then like a suppliant, prostrating himself on the ground,\r\nand imploring pardon with entreaties framed after the fashion of his\r\nnation, was bidden to take courage.\r\n\r\n66. A few days afterwards he was conducted to the court of the emperor,\r\nand thence he was sent to Rome, where he died of a lethargy in the\r\nforeign camp which is stationed on Mons Cælius.\r\n\r\n67. Notwithstanding that these numerous and important events were\r\nbrought to so happy an issue, some persons in the palace of Constantius,\r\ndisparaging Julian in order to give pleasure to the emperor, in a tone\r\nof derision called him Victorinus, because he, modestly relating how\r\noften he had been employed in leading the army, at the same time related\r\nthat the Germans had received many defeats.\r\n\r\n68. They at the same time, by loading the emperor with empty praises, of\r\nwhich the extravagance was glaringly conspicuous, so inflated an\r\ninherent pride, already beyond all natural bounds, that he was led to\r\nbelieve that, whatever took place in the whole circumference of the\r\nearth was owing to his fortunate auspices.\r\n\r\n69. So that, being inflated by the pompous language of his flatterers,\r\nhe then, and at all subsequent periods, became accustomed in all the\r\nedicts which he published to advance many unfounded statements;\r\nassuming, that he by himself had fought and conquered, when in fact he\r\nhad not been present at anything that had happened; often also asserting\r\nthat he had raised up the suppliant kings of conquered nations. For\r\ninstance, if while he was still in Italy any of his generals had fought\r\na brilliant campaign against the Persians, the emperor would write\r\ntriumphant letters to the provinces without the slightest mention of the\r\ngeneral throughout its whole length, relating with odious self-praise\r\nhow he himself had fought in the front ranks.\r\n\r\n70. Lastly, edicts of his are still extant, laid up among the public\r\nrecords of the empire ... relating ...[69] and extolling himself to the\r\nskies. A letter also is to be found, though he was forty days' journey\r\nfrom Strasburg when the battle was fought, describing the engagement,\r\nsaying that he marshalled the army, stood among the standard-bearers,\r\nand put the barbarians to the rout; and with amazing falsehood asserting\r\nthat Chnodomarius was brought before him, without (oh shameful\r\nindignity!) saying a single word about the exploits of Julian; which he\r\nwould have utterly buried in oblivion if fame had not refused to let\r\ngreat deeds die, however many people may try to keep them in the shade.\r\n\r\n\r\n[59] The text is defective here, as it is wherever these marks occur.\r\n\r\n[60] Coblenz.\r\n\r\n[61] Julius Cæsar: the story of the frightened fisherman being\r\nencouraged by the assurance that he was carrying \"Cæsar and his\r\nfortunes\" is universally known.\r\n\r\n[62] Claudius, who devoted himself in the Gothic war.\r\n\r\n[63] Galerius Maximianus, who reconnoitred in person the camp of the\r\nking of Persia.\r\n\r\n[64] The word is derived from +klibanon+, an oven, and seems to\r\nmean entirely clothed in iron.\r\n\r\n[65] Valeria was a division of Pannonia, so called from Valeria, the\r\ndaughter of Diocletian, and the wife of Galerius.\r\n\r\n[66] Troops named from the fashion of their arms; the Cornuti having\r\nprojections like horns on their helmets, the Braccati wearing drawers.\r\n\r\n[67] The testudo was properly applied to the manner in which they locked\r\ntheir shields over their heads while advancing to storm a walled town.\r\n\r\n[68] The Mirmillo was a gladiator opposed to a Retiarius, protecting\r\nhimself by his oblong shield against the net of the latter.\r\n\r\n[69] The text is mutilated here, as in many other passages similarly\r\nmarked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK XVII.\r\n\r\nARGUMENT.\r\n\r\n     I.

The Emperor\r\n     Constantius compels the Sarmatians to give hostage, and to restore\r\n     their prisoners; and imposes a king on the Sarmatian exiles, whom\r\n     he restores to their country and to freedom.--XIII. He compels the\r\n     Limigantes, after defeating them with great slaughter, to emigrate,\r\n     and harangues his own soldiers.--XIV. The Roman ambassadors, who\r\n     had been sent to treat for peace, return from Persia; and Sapor\r\n     returns into Armenia and Mesopotamia.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nA.D. 357.\r\n\r\n§ 1. After the various affairs which we have described were brought to a\r\nconclusion, the warlike young prince, now that the battle of Strasburg\r\nhad secured him the navigation of the Rhine, felt anxious that the\r\nill-omened birds should not feed on the corpses of the slain, and so\r\nordered them all to be buried without distinction. And having dismissed\r\nthe ambassadors whom we have mentioned as having come with some arrogant\r\nmessages before the battle, he returned to Saverne.\r\n\r\n2. From this place he ordered all the booty and the prisoners to be\r\nbrought to Metz, to be left there till his return. Then departing for\r\nMayence, to lay down a bridge at that city and to seek the barbarians in\r\ntheir own territories, since he had left none of them in arms, he was at\r\nfirst met by great opposition on the part of his army; but addressing\r\nthem with eloquence and persuasion he soon won them to his opinion. For\r\ntheir affection for him, becoming strengthened by repeated experience,\r\ninduced them to follow one who shared in all their toils, and who, while\r\nnever surrendering his authority, was still accustomed, as every one\r\nsaw, to impose more labour on himself than on his men. They soon arrived\r\nat the appointed spot, and, crossing the river by a bridge they laid\r\ndown, occupied the territory of the enemy.\r\n\r\n3. The barbarians, amazed at the greatness of his enterprise, inasmuch\r\nas they had fancied they were situated in a position in which they could\r\nhardly be disturbed, were now led by the destruction of their countrymen\r\nto think anxiously of their own future fate, and accordingly, pretending\r\nto implore peace that they might escape from the violence of his first\r\ninvasion, they sent ambassadors to him with a set message, offering a\r\nlasting treaty of agreement; but (though it is not known what design or\r\nchange of circumstances altered their purpose) they immediately\r\nafterwards sent off some others with all speed, to threaten our troops\r\nwith implacable war if they did not at once quit their territories.\r\n\r\n4. And when this was known, the Cæsar, as soon as all was quiet, at the\r\nbeginning of night embarked 800 men in some small swift boats, with the\r\nintention that they should row with all their strength up stream for\r\nsome distance, and then land and destroy all they could find with fire\r\nand sword.\r\n\r\n5. After he had made this arrangement, the barbarians were seen at\r\ndaybreak on the tops of the mountains, on which our soldiers were led\r\nwith speed to the higher ground; and when no enemy was found there\r\n(since the barbarians, divining their plan, immediately retreated to a\r\ndistance), presently large volumes of smoke were seen, which indicated\r\nthat our men had broken into the enemy's territory, and were laying it\r\nwaste.\r\n\r\n6. This event broke the spirit of the Germans, who, deserting the\r\nambuscades which they had laid for our men in narrow defiles full of\r\nlurking-places, they fled across the river Maine to carry aid to their\r\ncountrymen.\r\n\r\n7. For, as is often the case in times of uncertainty and difficulty,\r\nthey were panic-stricken by the incursion of our cavalry on the one\r\nside, and the sudden attacks of our infantry, conveyed in boats, on the\r\nother; and therefore, relying on their knowledge of the country, they\r\nsought safety in the rapidity of their flight; and, as their retreat\r\nleft the motions of our troops free, we plundered the wealthy farms of\r\ntheir crops and their cattle, sparing no one. And having carried off a\r\nnumber of prisoners, we set fire to, and burnt to the ground all their\r\nhouses, which in that district were built more carefully than usual, in\r\nthe Roman fashion.\r\n\r\n8. And when we had penetrated a distance of ten miles, till we came near\r\na wood terrible from the denseness of its shade, our army halted for a\r\nwhile, and stayed its advance, having learnt from information given by a\r\ndeserter that a number of enemies were concealed in some subterranean\r\npassages and caverns with many entrances in the neighbourhood, ready to\r\nsally forth when a favourable opportunity should appear.\r\n\r\n9. Nevertheless our men presently ventured to advance in full\r\nconfidence, and found the roads blockaded by oaks, ashes, and pines, of\r\ngreat size, cut down and laid together. And so they retreated with\r\ncaution, perceiving that it was impossible to advance except by long and\r\nrugged defiles; though they could hardly restrain their indignation at\r\nbeing compelled to do so.\r\n\r\n10. The weather too became very severe, so that they were enveloped in\r\nall kinds of toil and danger to no purpose (forasmuch as it was now past\r\nthe autumnal equinox, and the snow, which had already fallen in those\r\nregions, covered the mountains and the plains), and so, instead of\r\nproceeding, Julian undertook a work worthy of being related.\r\n\r\n11. He repaired with great expedition, while there was no one to hinder\r\nhim, the fortress which Trajan had constructed in the territory of the\r\nAllemanni, and to which he had given his own name, and which had lately\r\nbeen attacked with great violence and almost destroyed. And he placed\r\nthere a temporary garrison, and also some magazines, which he had\r\ncollected from the barbarians.\r\n\r\n12. But when the Allemanni saw these preparations made for their\r\ndestruction, they assembled rapidly in great consternation at what had\r\nalready been done, and sent ambassadors to implore peace, with prayers\r\nof extreme humility. And the Cæsar, now that he had fully matured and\r\nsecured the success of all his designs, taking into consideration all\r\nprobabilities, granted them a truce for ten months. In reality he was\r\nespecially influenced by this prudent consideration, that the camp which\r\nhe had thus occupied without hindrance, in a way that could hardly have\r\nbeen hoped for, required, nevertheless, to be fortified with mural\r\nengines and other adequate equipments.\r\n\r\n13. Trusting to this truce, three of the most ferocious of those kings\r\nwho had sent reinforcements to their countrymen when defeated at\r\nStrasburg, came to him, though still in some degree of alarm, and took\r\nthe oaths according to the formula in use in their country, that they\r\nwould create no further disturbance, but that they would keep the truce\r\nfaithfully up to the appointed day, because that had been the decision\r\nof our generals; and that they would not attack the fortress; and that\r\nthey would even bring supplies to it on their shoulders if the garrison\r\ninformed them that they were in want; all which they promised, because\r\ntheir fear bridled their treachery.\r\n\r\n14. In this memorable war, which deserves to be compared with those\r\nagainst the Carthaginians or the Gauls, yet was accompanied with very\r\nlittle loss to the republic, Julian triumphed as a fortunate and\r\nsuccessful leader. The very smallness of his losses might have given\r\nsome colour to the assertions of his detractors, who declared that he\r\nhad only fought bravely on all occasions, because he preferred dying\r\ngloriously to being put to death like his brother Gallus, as a condemned\r\nmalefactor, as they had expected he would be, if he had not, after the\r\ndeath of Constantius, continued to distinguish himself equally by\r\nsplendid exploits.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. Now when everything was settled in that country as fairly as the\r\ncase permitted, Julian, returning to his winter quarters, found some\r\ntrouble still left for him. Severus, the master of the horse, being on\r\nthe way to Rheims through Cologne and Juliers, fell in with some strong\r\nbattalions of Franks, consisting of six hundred light-armed soldiers,\r\nwho were laying waste those places which were not defended by garrisons.\r\nThey had been encouraged to this audacious wickedness by the opportunity\r\nafforded them when the Cæsar was occupied in the remote districts of the\r\nAllemanni, thinking to obtain a rich booty without any hindrance. But in\r\nfear of the army which had now returned, they occupied two fortresses\r\nwhich had been abandoned for some time, and defended themselves there as\r\nlong as they could.\r\n\r\n2. Julian, amazed at the novelty of such an attempt, and thinking it\r\nimpossible to say how far such a spirit would spread if he allowed it to\r\npass without a check, halted his soldiers, and gave orders to blockade\r\nthe forts.... The Meuse passes beneath them; and the blockade was\r\nprotracted for fifty-four days, through nearly the entire months of\r\nDecember and January, the barbarians resisting with incredible obstinacy\r\nand courage.\r\n\r\n3. Then the Cæsar, like an experienced general, fearing that the\r\nbarbarians might take advantage of some moonless night to cross over the\r\nriver, which was now thoroughly frozen, ordered soldiers to go up and\r\ndown the stream every day in light boats, from sunset till daybreak, so\r\nas to break the crust of ice and prevent any one from escaping in that\r\nmanner. Owing to this manoeuvre, the barbarians were so exhausted by\r\nhunger, watching, and the extremity of despair, that at last they\r\nvoluntarily surrendered, and were immediately sent to the court of the\r\nemperor.\r\n\r\n4. And a vast multitude of Franks, who had come to their assistance,\r\nhearing that they were taken prisoners and sent off, would not venture\r\non any further enterprise, but returned to their own country. And when\r\nthis affair was finished, the Cæsar retired to Paris to pass the winter\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. It was now expected that a number of tribes would unite in greater\r\nforce, and therefore the prudent Julian, bearing in mind the\r\nuncertainties of war, became very anxious and full of care. And as he\r\nthought that the truce lately made, though not free from trouble, and\r\nnot of long duration, still gave him opportunity to remedy some things\r\nwhich were faulty, he began to remodel the arrangements about tribute.\r\n\r\n2. And when Florentius, the prefect of the prætorium, having taken an\r\nestimate of everything, affirmed that whatever deficiency there might be\r\nin the produce of a capitation tax he should be able to make good from\r\nwhat he could levy by force, Julian, deprecating this practice,\r\ndetermined to lose his own life rather than permit it.\r\n\r\n3. For he knew that the wounds inflicted by such extortions, or, as I\r\nshould rather call them, confiscations, are incurable, and have often\r\nreduced provinces to extreme destitution. Indeed, such conduct, as will\r\nbe related hereafter, utterly lost us Illyricum.\r\n\r\n4. And when, owing to this resolution of his, the prætorian prefect\r\nexclaimed that it could not be endured that he, to whom the emperor had\r\nintrusted the chief authority in this matter, should be thus distrusted,\r\nJulian attempted to appease him, showing by exact and accurate\r\ncalculations that the capitation tax was not only enough, but more than\r\nenough to provide all the necessary supplies.\r\n\r\n5. And when some time afterwards an edict for a supplementary tax was\r\nnevertheless presented to him by Florentius, he refused to sign or even\r\nto read it; and threw it on the ground; and when warned by letters from\r\nthe emperor (written on receiving the prefect's report) not to act in so\r\nembarrassing a manner, lest he should seem to be diminishing the\r\nauthority of Florentius, Julian wrote in answer, that it was a matter to\r\nbe thankful for, if a province that had been devastated in every\r\ndirection could still pay its regular taxes, without demanding from it\r\nany extraordinary contributions, which indeed no punishments could\r\nextort from men in a state of destitution: and then, and from that time\r\nforward, owing to the firmness of one man, no one ever attempted to\r\nextort anything illegal in Gaul beyond the regular taxes.\r\n\r\n6. The Cæsar had also in another affair set an example wholly\r\nunprecedented, entreating the prefect to intrust to him the government\r\nof the second Belgic province, which was oppressed by manifold evils; on\r\nthe especial and single condition that no officer, either belonging to\r\nthe prefect or to the garrison, should force any one to pay anything.\r\nAnd the whole people whom he thus took under his care, comforted and\r\nrelieved by this mildness, paid all the taxes due from them before the\r\nappointed day, without any demand being made upon them.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n§ 1. While Julian was thus beginning to put Gaul into a better\r\ncondition, and while Orfitus was still governor of the second province,\r\nan obelisk was erected at Rome, in the Circus Maximus, concerning which,\r\nas this seems a convenient opportunity, I will mention a few\r\nparticulars.\r\n\r\n2. The city of Thebes, in Egypt, built in remote ages, with enormous\r\nwalls, and celebrated also for entrances by a hundred gates, was from\r\nthis circumstance called by its founders +hekatompylos+\r\n(_Hecatompylos_); and from the name of this city the whole district is\r\nknown as Thebais.\r\n\r\n3. When Carthage began to rise in greatness, the Carthaginian generals\r\nconquered and destroyed Thebes by a sudden attack. And after it was\r\nrebuilt, Cambyses, the celebrated king of Persia, who throughout his\r\nwhole life was covetous and ferocious, overran Egypt, and again attacked\r\nthis city that he might plunder it of its wealth, which was enough to\r\nexcite his envy; and he spared not even the offerings which had been\r\nmade to the gods.\r\n\r\n4. And while he was in his savage manner moving to and fro among his\r\nplunderers, he got entangled in his own flowing robes, and fell on his\r\nface, and by the fall his dagger, which he wore close to his thigh, got\r\nloose from the scabbard, and he was mortally wounded and died.\r\n\r\n5. And long afterwards, Cornelius Gallus, who was governor of Egypt at\r\nthe time when Octavianus was emperor of Rome, impoverished the city by\r\nplundering it of most of its treasuries; and returning to Rome on being\r\naccused of theft and of laying waste the province, he, from fear of the\r\nnobles, who were bitterly indignant against him, as one to whom the\r\nemperor had committed a most honourable task, fell on his own sword and\r\nso died. If I mistake not, he is the same person as Gallus the poet,\r\nwhose loss Virgil deplores at the end of his Bucolics, celebrating his\r\nmemory in sweet verses.\r\n\r\n6. In this city of Thebes, among many works of art and different\r\nstructures recording the tales relating to the Egyptian deities, we saw\r\nseveral obelisks in their places, and others which had been thrown down\r\nand broken; which the ancient kings, when elated at some victory or at\r\nthe general prosperity of their affairs, had caused to be hewn out of\r\nmountains in distant parts of the world, and erected in honour of the\r\ngods, to whom they solemnly consecrated them.\r\n\r\n7. Now an obelisk is a rough stone, rising to a great height, shaped\r\nlike a pillar in the stadium; and it tapers upwards in imitation of a\r\nsunbeam, keeping its quadrilateral shape, till it rises almost to a\r\npoint, being made smooth by the hand of a sculptor.\r\n\r\n8. On these obelisks the ancient authority of elementary wisdom has\r\ncaused innumerable marks of strange forms all over them, which are\r\ncalled hieroglyphics.\r\n\r\n9. For the workmen, carving many kinds of birds and beasts, some even\r\nsuch as must belong to another world, in order that the recollection of\r\nthe exploits which the obelisk was designed to commemorate might reach\r\nto subsequent ages, showed by them the accomplishment of vows which the\r\nkings had made.\r\n\r\n10. For it was not the case then as it is now, that the established\r\nnumber of letters can distinctly express whatever the human mind\r\nconceives; nor did the ancient Egyptians write in such a manner; but\r\neach separate character served for a separate noun or verb, and\r\nsometimes even for an entire sense.\r\n\r\n11. Of which fact the two following may for the present be sufficient\r\ninstances: by the figure of a vulture they indicate the name of nature;\r\nbecause naturalists declare that no males are found in this class of\r\nbird. And by the figure of a bee making honey they indicate a king;\r\nshowing by such a sign that stings as well as sweetness are the\r\ncharacteristics of a ruler; and there are many similar emblems.\r\n\r\n12. And because the flatterers, who were continually whispering into the\r\near of Constantius, kept always affirming that when Augustus Octavianus\r\nhad brought two obelisks from Heliopolis, a city of Egypt, one of which\r\nwas placed in the Circus Maximus, and the other in the Campus Martius,\r\nhe yet did not venture to touch or move this one which has just been\r\nbrought to Rome, being alarmed at the greatness of such a task; I would\r\nhave those, who do not know the truth, learn that the ancient emperor,\r\nthough he moved several obelisks, left this one untouched, because it\r\nwas especially dedicated to the Sun-god, and was set up within the\r\nprecincts of his magnificent temple, which it was impious to profane;\r\nand of which it was the most conspicuous ornament.\r\n\r\n13. But Constantine deeming that a consideration of no importance, had\r\nit torn up from its place, and thinking rightly that he should not be\r\noffering any insult to religion if he removed a splendid work from some\r\nother temple to dedicate it to the gods at Rome, which is the temple of\r\nthe whole world, let it lie on the ground for some time while\r\narrangements for its removal were being prepared. And when it had been\r\ncarried down the Nile, and landed at Alexandria, a ship of a burden\r\nhitherto unexampled, requiring three hundred rowers to propel it, was\r\nbuilt to receive it.\r\n\r\n14. And when these preparations were made, and after the aforenamed\r\nemperor had died, the enterprise began to cool. However, after a time it\r\nwas at last put on board ship, and conveyed over sea, and up the stream\r\nof the Tiber, which seemed as it were frightened, lest its own winding\r\nwaters should hardly be equal to conveying a present from the almost\r\nunknown Nile to the walls which itself cherished. At last the obelisk\r\nreached the village of Alexandria, three miles from the city; and then\r\nit was placed in a cradle, and drawn slowly on, and brought through the\r\nOstran gate and the public fish-market to the Circus Maximus.\r\n\r\n15. The only work remaining to be done was to raise it, which was\r\ngenerally believed to be hardly, if at all, practicable. And vast beams\r\nhaving been raised on end in a most dangerous manner, so that they\r\nlooked like a grove of machines, long ropes of huge size were fastened\r\nto them, darkening the very sky with their density, as they formed a web\r\nof innumerable threads; and into them the great stone itself, covered\r\nover as it was with elements of writing, was bound, and gradually raised\r\ninto the empty air, and long suspended, many thousands of men turning it\r\nround and round like a millstone, till it was at last placed in the\r\nmiddle of the square; and on it was placed a brazen sphere, made\r\nbrighter with plates of gold: and as that was immediately afterwards\r\nstruck by lightning, and destroyed, a brazen figure like a torch was\r\nplaced on it, also plated with gold--to look as if the torch were fully\r\nalight.\r\n\r\n16. Subsequent ages also removed other obelisks; one of which is in the\r\nVatican, a second in the garden of Sallust; and two in the monument of\r\nAugustus.\r\n\r\n17. But the writing which is engraven on the old obelisk in the Circus,\r\nwe have set forth below in Greek characters, following in this the work\r\nof Hermapion:--\r\n\r\n  +ARCHÊN APO TON NOTION DIERMÊNEUMENA\r\n  ECHEI\r\n  STICHOS PRÔTOS TADE.+\r\n\r\n18. The first line, beginning on the south side, bears this\r\ninterpretation--\"The Sun to Ramestes the king--I have given to thee to\r\nreign with joy over the whole earth; to thee whom the Sun and Apollo\r\nlove--to thee, the mighty truth-loving son of Heron--the god-born ruler\r\nof the habitable earth; whom the Sun has chosen above all men, the\r\nvaliant warlike King Ramestes. Under whose power, by his valour and\r\nmight, the whole world is placed. The King Ramestes, the immortal son of\r\nthe Sun.\"\r\n\r\n19. The second line is--\"The mighty Apollo, who takes his stand upon\r\ntruth, the lord of the diadem, he who has honoured Egypt by becoming its\r\nmaster, adorning Heliopolis, and having created the rest of the world,\r\nand having greatly honoured the gods who have their shrines in the city\r\nof the Sun; whom the son loves.\"\r\n\r\n20. The third line--\"The mighty Apollo, the all-brilliant son of the\r\nSun, whom the Sun chose above all others, and to whom the valiant Mars\r\ngave gifts. Thou whose good fortune abideth for ever. Thou whom Ammon\r\nloves. Thou who hast filled the temple of the Phoenix with good\r\nthings. Thou to whom the gods have given long life. Apollo the mighty\r\nson of Heron, Ramestes the king of the world. Who has defended Egypt,\r\nhaving subdued the foreign enemy. Whom the Sun loves. To whom the gods\r\nhave given long life--the master of the world--the immortal Ramestes.\"\r\n\r\n21. Another second line--\"The Sun, the great God, the master of heaven.\r\nI have given unto thee a life free from satiety. Apollo, the mighty\r\nmaster of the diadem; to whom nothing is comparable. To whom the lord of\r\nEgypt has erected many statues in this kingdom. And has made the city of\r\nHeliopolis as brilliant as the Sun himself, the master of heaven. The\r\nson of the Sun, the king living for ever, has co-operated in the\r\ncompletion of this work.\"\r\n\r\n22. A third line--\"I, the Sun, the god, the master of heaven, have given\r\nto Ramestes the king might and authority over all. Whom Apollo the\r\ntruth-lover, the master of time, and Vulcan the father of the gods hath\r\nchosen above others by reason of his courage. The all-rejoicing king,\r\nthe son of the Sun, and beloved by the Sun.\"\r\n\r\n23. The first line, looking towards the east--\"The great God of\r\nHeliopolis, the mighty Apollo who dwelleth in Heaven, the son of Heron\r\nwhom the Sun hath guided. Whom the gods have honoured. He who ruleth\r\nover all the earth: whom the Sun has chosen before all others. The king\r\nvaliant by the favour of Mars. Whom Ammon loveth, and the all-shining\r\ngod, who hath chosen him as a king for everlasting.\" And so on.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nA.D. 358.\r\n\r\n§ 1. In the consulship of Datianus and Cerealis, when all arrangements\r\nin Gaul were made with more careful zeal than before, and while the\r\nterror caused by past events still checked the outbreaks of the\r\nbarbarians, the king of the Persians, being still on the frontiers of\r\nthose nations which border on his dominions, and having made a treaty of\r\nalliance with the Chionitæ and the Gelani, the most warlike and\r\nindefatigable of all tribes, being about to return to his own country,\r\nreceived the letters of Tamsapor which announced to him that the Roman\r\nemperor was a suppliant for peace.\r\n\r\n2. And he, suspecting that Constantius would never have done so if the\r\nempire had not been weakened all over, raised his own pretensions, and\r\nembracing the name indeed of peace, offered very unwelcome conditions.\r\nAnd having sent a man of the name of Narses as ambassador with many\r\npresents, he gave him letters to Constantius, in which he in no respect\r\nabated of his natural pride. The purport of these letters we have\r\nunderstood to be this:--\r\n\r\n3. \"I, Sapor, king of kings, partner of the stars, brother of the sun\r\nand moon, to Constantius Cæsar my brother send much greeting. I am glad\r\nand am well pleased that at last thou hast returned to the right way,\r\nand hast acknowledged the incorruptible decree of equity, having gained\r\nexperience by facts, and having learnt what disasters an obstinate\r\ncovetousness of the property of others has often caused.\r\n\r\n4. \"Because therefore the language of truth ought to be unrestrained and\r\nfree, and because men in the highest rank ought only to say what they\r\nmean, I will reduce my propositions into a few words; remembering that I\r\nhave already often repeated what I am now about to say.\r\n\r\n5. \"Even your own ancient records bear witness that my ancestors\r\npossessed all the country up to the Strymon and the frontier of\r\nMacedonia. And these lands it is fitting that I who (not to speak\r\narrogantly) am superior to those ancient kings in magnificence, and in\r\nall eminent virtues, should now reclaim. But I am at all times\r\nthoughtful to remember that, from my earliest youth, I have never done\r\nanything to repent of.\r\n\r\n6. \"And therefore it is a duty in me to recover Armenia and Mesopotamia,\r\nwhich were wrested from my ancestor by deliberate treachery. That\r\nprinciple was never admitted by us which you with exultation assert,\r\nthat all successes in war deserve praise, without considering whether\r\nthey were achieved by valour or by treachery.\r\n\r\n7. \"Lastly, if you are willing to be guided by one who gives you good\r\nadvice, I would bid you despise a small part of your dominions which is\r\never the parent of sorrow and bloodshed, in order to reign in safety\r\nover the rest. Wisely considering that physicians also sometimes apply\r\ncautery or amputation, and cut off portions of the body that the patient\r\nmay have good use of the rest of his limbs. Nay, that even beasts do the\r\nsame: since when they observe on what account they are most especially\r\nhunted, they will of their own accord deprive themselves of that, in\r\norder henceforth to be able to live in security.\r\n\r\n8. \"This, in short, I declare, that should my present embassy return\r\nwithout having succeeded in its object, after giving the winter season\r\nto rest I will gird myself up with all my strength, and while fortune\r\nand justice give me a well-founded hope of ultimate success, I will\r\nhasten my march as much as Providence will permit.\"\r\n\r\n9. Having given long consideration to this letter, the emperor with\r\nupright and wise heart, as the saying is, made answer in this manner:--\r\n\r\n10. \"Constantius, always august, conqueror by land and sea, to my\r\nbrother Sapor much health. I congratulate thee on thy safety, as one who\r\nis willing to be a friend to thee if thou wilt. But I greatly blame thy\r\ninsatiable covetousness, now more grasping than ever.\r\n\r\n11. \"Thou demandest Mesopotamia as thine own, and then Armenia. And thou\r\nbiddest me cut off some members from my sound body in order to place its\r\nhealth on a sound footing: a demand which is to be rejected at once\r\nrather than to be encouraged by any consent. Receive therefore the\r\ntruth, not covered with any pretences, but clear, and not to be shaken\r\nby any threats.\r\n\r\n12. \"The prefect of my prætorian guard, thinking to undertake an affair\r\nwhich might be beneficial to the state, without my knowledge discoursed\r\nabout peace with thy generals, by the agency of some low persons. Peace\r\nwe should neither regret nor refuse--let it only come with credit and\r\nhonour, in such a way as to impair neither our self-respect nor our\r\ndignity.\r\n\r\n13. \"For it would be an unbecoming and shameful thing when all men's\r\nears are filled with our exploits, so as to have shut even the mouth of\r\nenvy; when after the destruction of tyrants the whole Roman world obeys\r\nus, to give up those territories which even when limited to the narrow\r\nboundaries of the east we preserved undiminished.\r\n\r\n14. \"But I pray thee make an end of the threats which thou utterest\r\nagainst me, in obedience to thy national habit, when it cannot be\r\ndoubted that it is not from inactivity, but from moderation, that we\r\nhave at times endured attacks instead of being the assailants ourselves:\r\nand know that, whenever we are attacked, we defend our own with bravery\r\nand good will: being assured both by thy reading and thy personal\r\nexperience that in battle it has been rare for Romans to meet with\r\ndisaster; and that in the final issue of a war we have never come off\r\nthe worst.\"\r\n\r\n15. The embassy was therefore dismissed without gaining any of its\r\nobjects; and indeed no other reply could be given to the unbridled\r\ncovetousness of the king. And a few days afterwards, Count Prosper\r\nfollowed, and Spectatus the tribune and secretary; and also, by the\r\nsuggestion of Musonianus, Eustathius the philosopher, as one skilful in\r\npersuading, bearing a letter from the emperor, and presents, with a view\r\nto induce Sapor to suspend his preparations, so that all our attention\r\nmight be turned to fortifying the northern provinces in the most\r\neffective manner.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n§ 1. Now while these affairs, of so doubtful a complexion, were\r\nproceeding, that portion of the Allemanni which borders on the regions\r\nof Italy, forgetful of the peace and of the treaties which they only\r\nobtained by abject entreaty, laid waste the Tyrol with such fury that\r\nthey even went beyond their usual habit in undertaking the siege of some\r\nwalled towns.\r\n\r\n2. And when a strong force had been sent to repel them under the command\r\nof Barbatio, who had been promoted to the command of the infantry in the\r\nroom of Silvanus, a man of not much activity, but a fluent talker, he,\r\nas his troops were in a high state of indignation at the invaders, gave\r\nthem so terrible a defeat, that only a very few, who took to flight in\r\ntheir panic, escaped to carry back their tears and lamentations to their\r\nhomes.\r\n\r\n3. In this battle Nevitta, who afterwards became consul, was present as\r\ncommander of a squadron of cavalry, and displayed great gallantry.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. This year also some terrible earthquakes took place in Macedonia,\r\nAsia Minor, and Pontus, and their repeated shocks overthrew many towns,\r\nand even mountains. But the most remarkable of all the manifold\r\ndisasters which they caused was the entire ruin of Nicomedia, the\r\nmetropolis of Bithynia; which I will here relate with truth and brevity.\r\n\r\n2. On the 23rd of August, at daybreak, some heavy black clouds suddenly\r\nobscured the sky, which just before was quite fair. And the sun was so\r\nwholly concealed that it was impossible to see what was near or even\r\nquite close, so completely did a thick lurid darkness settle on the\r\nground, preventing the least use of the eyes.\r\n\r\n3. Presently, as if the supreme deity were himself letting loose his\r\nfatal wrath, and stirring up the winds from their hinges, a violent\r\nraging storm descended, by the fury of which the groaning mountains were\r\nstruck, and the crash of the waves on the shore was heard to a vast\r\ndistance. And then followed typhoons and whirlwinds with a horrid\r\ntrembling of the earth, throwing down the whole city and its suburbs.\r\n\r\n4. And as most of the houses were built on the slopes of the hills, they\r\nnow fell down one over the other, while all around resounded with the\r\nvast crash of their fall. In the mean time the tops of the hills\r\nre-echoed all sorts of noises, as well as outcries of men seeking their\r\nwives and children, and other relations.\r\n\r\n5. At last, after two hours, or at least within three, the air became\r\nagain clear and serene, and disclosed the destruction which till then\r\nwas unseen. Some, overwhelmed by the enormous masses of ruins which had\r\nfallen upon them, were crushed to death. Some were buried up to the\r\nneck, and might have been saved if there had been any timely help at\r\nhand, but perished for want of assistance; others were transfixed by the\r\npoints of beams projecting forth, on which they hung suspended.\r\n\r\n6. Here was seen a crowd of persons slain by one blow; there a\r\npromiscuous heap of corpses piled in various ways--some were buried\r\nbeneath the roofs of falling houses, which leant over so as to protect\r\nthem from any actual blows, but reserved them for an agonizing death by\r\nstarvation. Among whom was Aristænetus, who, with the authority of\r\ndeputy, governed Bithynia, which had been recently erected into a\r\nprovince; and to which Constantius had given the name of Piety, in\r\nhonour of his wife Eusebia, (a Greek word, equivalent to Pietas in\r\nLatin); and he perished thus by a lingering death.\r\n\r\n7. Others who were overwhelmed by the sudden fall of vast buildings, are\r\nstill lying entombed beneath the immovable masses. Some with their\r\nskulls fractured, or their shoulders or legs cut through, lay between\r\nlife and death, imploring aid from others suffering equally with\r\nthemselves; but in spite of their entreaties they were abandoned.\r\n\r\n8. Not but what the greater part of the temples and buildings and of the\r\ncitizens also would have escaped unhurt, if a fire had not suddenly\r\nbroken out, which raged with great violence for fifty days and nights,\r\nand destroyed all that remained.\r\n\r\n9. I think this a good opportunity to enumerate a few of the conjectures\r\nwhich the ancients have formed about earthquakes. For as to any accurate\r\nknowledge of their causes, not only has that never been attained by the\r\nignorance of the common people, but they have equally eluded the long\r\nlucubrations and subtle researches of natural philosophers.\r\n\r\n10. And on this account in all priestly ceremonies, whether ritual or\r\npontifical, care is taken not at such times to name one god more than\r\nanother, for fear of impiety, since it is quite uncertain which god\r\ncauses these visitations.\r\n\r\n11. But as the various opinions, among which Aristotle wavers and\r\nhesitates, suggest, earthquakes are engendered either in small caverns\r\nunder the earth, which the Greeks call +syrigges+, because of\r\nthe waters pouring through them with a more rapid motion than usual, or,\r\nas Anaxagoras affirms, they arise from the force of the wind penetrating\r\nthe lower parts of the earth, which, when they have got down to the\r\nencrusted solid mass, finding no vent-holes, shake those portions in\r\ntheir solid state, into which they have got entrance when in a state of\r\nsolution. And this is corroborated by the observation that at such times\r\nno breezes of wind are felt by us above ground, because the winds are\r\noccupied in the lowest recesses of the earth.\r\n\r\n12. Anaximander says that the earth when burnt up by excessive heat and\r\ndrought, and also after excessive rains, opens larger fissures than\r\nusual, which the upper air penetrates with great force and in excessive\r\nquantities, and the earth, shaken by the furious blasts which penetrate\r\nthose fissures, is disturbed to its very foundations; for which reason\r\nthese fearful events occur either at times of great evaporation or else\r\nat those of an extravagant fall of rain from heaven. And therefore the\r\nancient poets and theologians gave Neptune the name of Earthshaker,[70]\r\nas being the power of moist substance.\r\n\r\n13. Now earthquakes take place in four manners: either they are\r\n_brasmatiæ_,[71] which raise up the ground in a terrible manner, and\r\nthrow vast masses up to the surface, as in Asia, Delos arose, and Hiera;\r\nand also Anaphe and Rhodes, which has at different times been called\r\nOphiusa and Pelagia, and was once watered with a shower of gold;[72] and\r\nEleusis in Boeotia, and the Hellenian islands in the Tyrrhenian sea,\r\nand many other islands. Or they are _climatiæ_,[73] which, with a\r\nslanting and oblique blow, level cities, edifices, and mountains. Or\r\n_chasmatiæ_,[74] which suddenly, by a violent motion, open huge mouths,\r\nand so swallow up portions of the earth, as in the Atlantic sea, on the\r\ncoast of Europe, a large island[75] was swallowed up, and in the\r\nCrissæan Gulf, Helice and Bura,[76] and in Italy, in the Ciminian\r\ndistrict, the town of Saccumum[77] was swallowed up in a deep gulf and\r\nhidden in everlasting darkness. And among these three kinds of\r\nearthquakes, _myæmotiæ_[78] are heard with a threatening roar, when the\r\nelements either spring apart, their joints being broken, or again\r\nresettle in their former places, when the earth also settles back; for\r\nthen it cannot be but that crashes and roars of the earth should resound\r\nwith bull-like bellowings. Let us now return to our original subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. Cæsar, passing his winter among the Parisii, was eagerly preparing\r\nto anticipate the Allemanni, who were not yet assembled in one body, but\r\nwho, since the battle of Strasburg, were working themselves up to a\r\npitch of insane audacity and ferocity. And he was waiting with great\r\nimpatience for the month of July, when the Gallic campaigns usually\r\nbegin. For indeed he could not march before the summer had banished the\r\nfrost and cold, and allowed him to receive supplies from Aquitania.\r\n\r\n2. But as diligence overcomes almost all difficulties, he, revolving\r\nmany plans of all kinds in his mind, at last conceived the idea of not\r\nwaiting till the crops were ripe, but falling on the barbarians before\r\nthey expected him. And having resolved on that plan, he caused his men\r\nto take corn for twenty days' consumption from what they had in store,\r\nand to make it into biscuit, so that it might keep longer; and this\r\nenabled the soldiers to carry it, which they did willingly. And relying\r\non this provision, and setting out as before, with favourable auspices,\r\nhe reckoned that in the course of five or six months he might finish two\r\nurgent and indispensable expeditions.\r\n\r\n3. And when all his preparations were made, he first marched against\r\nthe Franks, that is against that tribe of them usually called Salii, who\r\nsome time before had ventured with great boldness to fix their\r\nhabitations on the Roman soil near Toxandria.[79] But when he had\r\nreached Tongres, he was met by an embassy from this tribe, who expected\r\nstill to find him in his winter quarters, offering him peace on\r\ncondition of his leaving them unattacked and unmolested, as if the\r\nground they had seized were rightfully their own. Julian comprehended\r\nthe whole affair, and having given the ambassadors an ambiguous reply,\r\nand also some presents, sent them back again, leaving them to suppose he\r\nwould remain in the same place till they returned.\r\n\r\n4. But the moment they had departed he followed them, sending Severus\r\nalong the bank of the river, and suddenly came upon the whole settlement\r\nlike a thunderbolt; and availing himself of his victory to make a\r\nreasonable exhibition of clemency, as indeed they met him with\r\nentreaties rather than with resistance, he received the submission of\r\nthem and their children.\r\n\r\n5. He then attacked the Chamavi,[80] who had been guilty of similar\r\naudacity, and through the same celerity of movement he slew one portion\r\nof them, and another who made a vigorous resistance he took prisoners,\r\nwhile others who fled precipitately he allowed to escape unhurt to their\r\nown territories, to avoid exhausting his soldiers with a long campaign.\r\nAnd when ambassadors were afterwards sent by them to implore his pardon,\r\nand generally to do what they could for them, when they prostrated\r\nthemselves before him, he granted them peace on condition of retiring to\r\ntheir own districts without doing any mischief.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\n§ 1. Everything thus succeeding according to his wish, Julian, always on\r\nthe watch to establish by every means in his power the security of the\r\nprovinces on a solid foundation, determined to put in as good repair as\r\nthe time permitted those fortresses erected in a line on the banks of\r\nthe Meuse, which some time before had been destroyed by an attack of\r\nthe barbarians. And accordingly he desisted for a while from all other\r\noperations, and restored them.\r\n\r\n2. And that he might by a prudent rapidity insure their safety, he took\r\na part of the seventeen days' provisions, which troops, when going on an\r\nexpedition, carry on their backs, and stored in those forts, hoping to\r\nreplace what he thus took from the soldiers by seizing the crops of the\r\nChamavi.\r\n\r\n3. But he was greatly disappointed. For as the crops were not yet ripe,\r\nthe soldiers when they had consumed what they had with them were unable\r\nto find food, and began to utter violent threats against Julian, mingled\r\nwith fierce cries and reproaches, calling him Asiatic, Greek, a cheat,\r\nand a fool pretending to be wise. And as it is commonly the case among\r\nsoldiers that some men are found of remarkable fluency of speech, they\r\npoured forth such harangues as this:--\r\n\r\n4. \"Whither are we being dragged, having lost all hope of good fortune?\r\nWe formerly, indeed, suffered terrible hardships in the snow, and cruel\r\nbiting frost; but now (oh, shame!), when we have the fate of the enemy\r\nin our hands, we are wasting away with famine, the most miserable of all\r\ndeaths. Let no one think that we are stirrers up of tumults; we declare\r\nthat we are speaking for our very lives. We do not ask for gold or\r\nsilver, which it is long since we have touched or seen, and which are as\r\nmuch denied to us as if we had been convicted of having encountered all\r\nour toils and perils in the service of the enemies of the republic.\"\r\n\r\n5. And their complaints were just. For after all his gallant exploits\r\nand all his doubtful changes and dangers, the soldiers were exhausted by\r\nhis Gallic campaigns, without even receiving either donation or pay from\r\nthe time that Julian was sent to take the command; because he himself\r\nhad nothing to give, nor would Constantius permit anything to be drawn\r\nfor that purpose from the treasury, as had been the custom.\r\n\r\n6. And at a later period it was manifest that this was owing more to\r\nill-will than to parsimony, because when Julian had given some small\r\ncoin to one of the common soldiers, who, as was the custom, had asked\r\nfor some to get shaved with, he was attacked for it with most insulting\r\ncalumnies by Gaudentius, the secretary, who had long remained in Gaul as\r\na spy upon his actions, and whom he himself subsequently ordered to be\r\nput to death, as will be related in its fitting place.\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\n§ 1. When at length their discontent was appeased by various kinds of\r\ncaresses, and when the Rhine had been crossed by a bridge of boats,\r\nwhich was thrown over it, Severus, the master of the horse, up to that\r\ntime a brave and energetic soldier, suddenly lost all his vigour.\r\n\r\n2. And he who had frequently been used to exhort the troops, both in\r\nbodies and as individuals, to gallant acts, now seemed a base and timid\r\nskulker from battle, as if he feared the approach of death. As we read\r\nin the books of Tages[81] that those who are fated to be soon struck by\r\nlightning, so lose their senses that they cannot hear thunder, or even\r\ngreater noises. And he marched on in a lazy way, not natural to him, and\r\neven threatened with death the guides, who were leading on the army with\r\na brisk step, if they would not agree to say that they were wholly\r\nignorant of the road any further. So they, fearing his power, and being\r\nforbidden to show the way any more, advanced no further.\r\n\r\n3. But amid this delay, Suomarius, king of the Allemanni, arrived\r\nunexpectedly with his suite; and he who had formerly been fierce and\r\neager for any injury to the Romans, was now inclined to regard it as an\r\nunexpected gain to be permitted to retain his former possessions. And\r\nbecause his looks and his gait showed him to be a suppliant, he was\r\nreceived as a friend, and desired to be of good cheer. But still he\r\nsubmitted himself to Julian's discretion, and implored peace on his\r\nbended knees. And peace was granted him, with pardon for the past, on\r\ncondition of giving up our prisoners and of supplying our soldiers with\r\nfood, whenever it was required, receiving, like any ordinary purveyor,\r\nsecurity for payment of what he provided. But he was at the same time\r\nwarned, that if he did not furnish the required supplies in time he\r\nwould be liable to be called in question for his former hostility.\r\n\r\n4. And that which had been discreetly planned was carried out without\r\nhindrance. Julian desiring to reach a town belonging to another\r\nchieftain, named Hortarius, towards which object nothing seemed wanting\r\nbut guides, gave orders to Nestica, a tribune of the Scutarii, and to\r\nChariettoa, a man of marvellous courage, to take great pains to capture\r\na prisoner and to bring him to him. A youth of the Allemanni was\r\nspeedily caught and brought before him, who, on condition of obtaining\r\nhis freedom, promised to show the road. The army, following him as its\r\nguide, was soon obstructed by an abattis of lofty trees, which had been\r\ncut down; but by taking long and circuitous paths, they at last came to\r\nthe desired spot, and the soldiers in their rage laid waste the fields\r\nwith fire, carried off the cattle and the inhabitants, and slew all who\r\nresisted without mercy.\r\n\r\n5. The king, bewildered at this disaster, seeing the numerous legions,\r\nand the remains of his burnt villages, and looking upon the last\r\ncalamities of fortune as impending over him, of his own accord implored\r\npardon, promising to do all that should be commanded him, and binding\r\nhimself on oath to restore all his prisoners. For that was the object\r\nabout which Julian was the most anxious. But still he restored only a\r\nfew, and detained the greater part of them.\r\n\r\n6. When Julian knew this, he was filled with just indignation, and when\r\nthe king came to receive the customary presents, the Cæsar refused to\r\nrelease his four companions, on whose support and fidelity the king\r\nprincipally relied, till all the prisoners were restored.\r\n\r\n7. But when the king was summoned by the Cæsar to a conference, looking\r\nup at him with trembling eyes, he was overcome by the aspect of the\r\nconqueror, and overwhelmed by a sense of his own embarrassing condition,\r\nand especially by the compulsion under which he was now (since it was\r\nreasonable that after so many successes of the Romans that the cities\r\nwhich had been destroyed by the violence of the barbarians should be\r\nrebuilt) to supply waggons and materials from his own stores and those\r\nof his subjects.\r\n\r\n8. And after he had promised to do so, and had bound himself with an\r\noath to consent to die if he were guilty of any treachery, he was\r\npermitted to return to his own country. For he could not be compelled to\r\nfurnish provisions like Suomarius, because his land had been so utterly\r\nlaid waste that nothing could be found on it for him to give.\r\n\r\n9. Thus those kings who were formerly so proud and accustomed to grow\r\nrich by the plunder of our citizens, were now brought under the Roman\r\nyoke; and as if they had been born and brought up among our tributaries,\r\nthey submitted to our commands, though with reluctance. And when these\r\nevents were thus brought to a conclusion, the Cæsar distributed his army\r\namong its usual stations, and returned to his winter quarters.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\n§ 1. When these transactions presently became known in the court of\r\nConstantius--for the knowledge of them could not be concealed, since the\r\nCæsar, as if he had been merely an officer of the emperor's, referred to\r\nhim on all occasions--those who had the greatest influence in the\r\npalace, being skilful professors of flattery, turned all Julian's\r\nwell-arranged plans and their successful accomplishment into ridicule;\r\ncontinually uttering such malicious sayings as this, \"We have had enough\r\nof the goat and his victories;\" sneering at Julian because of his beard,\r\nand calling him a chattering mole, a purple-robed ape, and a Greek\r\npedant. And pouring forth numbers of sneers of the same kind, acceptable\r\nto the emperor, who liked to hear them, they endeavoured with shameless\r\nspeeches to overwhelm Julian's virtues, slandering him as a lazy, timid,\r\ncarpet-knight, and one whose chief care was to set off his exploits by\r\nfine descriptions; it not being the first time that such a thing had\r\nbeen done.\r\n\r\n2. For the greatest glory is always exposed to envy. So we read in\r\nrespect of the illustrious generals of old, that, though no fault could\r\nbe found in them, still the malignity which found offence in their\r\ngreatest actions was constantly inventing false charges and accusations\r\nagainst them.\r\n\r\n3. In the same manner Cimon the son of Miltiades, who destroyed a vast\r\nhost of the Persians on the Eurymedon, a river in Pamphylia, and\r\ncompelled a nation always insolent and arrogant to beg for peace most\r\nhumbly, was accused of intemperance; and again Scipio Æmilianus, by\r\nwhose indomitable vigilance two[82] most powerful cities, which had made\r\ngreat efforts to injure Rome, were both destroyed, was disparaged as a\r\nmere drone.\r\n\r\n4. Moreover, wicked detractors, scrutinizing the character of Pompey,\r\nwhen no pretext for finding fault with him could be discovered, remarked\r\ntwo qualities in which they could raise a laugh against him; one that he\r\nhad a sort of natural trick of scratching his head with one finger:\r\nanother that for the purpose of concealing an unsightly sore, he used to\r\nbind one of his legs with a white bandage. Of which habits, the first\r\nthey said showed a dissolute man; the second, one eager for a change of\r\ngovernment; contending, with a somewhat meagre argument, that it did not\r\nsignify what part of his body he clothed with a badge of royal dignity;\r\nso snarling at that man of whom the most glorious proofs show that no\r\nbraver and truer patriot ever lived.\r\n\r\n5. During these transactions, Artemius, the deputy governor of Rome,\r\nsucceeded Bassus in the prefecture also; for Bassus, who had lately been\r\npromoted to be prefect of the city, had since died. His administration\r\nhad been marked by turbulent sedition, but by no other events\r\nsufficiently memorable to deserve mention.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. In the mean time, while the emperor was passing the winter quietly\r\nat Sirmium, he received frequent and trustworthy intelligence that the\r\nSarmatians and the Quadi, two tribes contiguous to each other, and\r\nsimilar in manners and mode of warfare, were conjointly overrunning\r\nPannonia and the second province of Moesia, in straggling detachments.\r\n\r\n2. These tribes are more suited to predatory incursions than to regular\r\nwar; they carry long spears, and wear breastplates made of horn scraped\r\nand polished, let into linen jackets, so that the layers of horn are\r\nlike the feathers of a bird. Their horses are chiefly geldings, lest at\r\nthe sight of mares they should be excited and run away, or, when held\r\nback in reserve, should betray their riders by their fierce neighing.\r\n\r\n3. They cover vast spaces in their movements, whether in pursuit or in\r\nretreat, their horses being swift and very manageable; and they lead\r\nwith them one or sometimes two spare chargers apiece, in order that the\r\nchange may keep up the strength of their cattle, and that their vigour\r\nmay be preserved by alternations of rest.\r\n\r\n4. Therefore, after the vernal equinox was past, the emperor, having\r\ncollected a strong body of soldiers, marched forth under the guidance of\r\npropitious fortune. Having arrived at a suitable place, he crossed the\r\nDanube, which was now flooded from the melting of the snow, by a bridge\r\nof boats, and descended on the lands of the barbarians, which he began\r\nto lay waste. They, being taken by surprise through the rapidity of his\r\nmarch, and seeing that the battalions of his warlike army were at their\r\nthroats, when they had not supposed it possible that such a force could\r\nbe collected for a year, had no courage to make a stand, but, as the\r\nonly means of escaping unexpected destruction, took to flight.\r\n\r\n5. When many had been slain, fear fettering their steps, those whose\r\nspeed had saved them from death hid themselves among the secret defiles\r\nof the mountains, and from thence beheld their country destroyed by the\r\nsword, which they might have delivered if they had resisted with as much\r\nvigour as they fled.\r\n\r\n6. These events took place in that part of Sarmatia which looks towards\r\nthe second Pannonia. Another military expedition, conducted with equal\r\ncourage, routed the troops of the barbarians in Valeria, who were\r\nplundering and destroying everything within their reach.\r\n\r\n7. Terrified at the greatness of this disaster, the Sarmatians, under\r\npretext of imploring peace, planned to divide their force into three\r\nbodies, and to attack our army while in a state of fancied security; so\r\nthat they should neither be able to prepare their weapons, nor avoid\r\nwounds, nor (which is the last resource in a desperate case) take to\r\nflight.\r\n\r\n8. There were with the Sarmatians likewise on this occasion, as\r\npartners in their danger, the Quadi,[83] who had often before taken part\r\nin the injuries inflicted on us; but their prompt boldness did not help\r\nthem on this occasion, rushing as they did into open danger.\r\n\r\n9. For many of them were slain, and the survivors escaped among the\r\nhills, with which they were familiar. And as this event raised the\r\nspirits and courage of our army, they united in solid columns, and\r\nmarched with speed into the territories of the Quadi; who, having learnt\r\nby the past to dread the evils which impended over them, came boldly\r\ninto the emperor's presence to implore peace as suppliants, since he was\r\ninclined to be merciful in such cases. On the day appointed for settling\r\nthe conditions, one of their princes named Zizais, a young man of great\r\nstature, marshalled the ranks of the Sarmatians to offer their\r\nentreaties of peace in the fashion of an army; and as soon as they came\r\nwithin sight, he threw away his arms, and fell like one dead,\r\nprostrating himself on his breast before the emperor; his very voice\r\nfrom fear refusing its office, when he ought to have uttered his\r\nentreaties, he awakened the more pity, making many attempts, and being\r\nscarcely able from the violence of his sobs to give utterance to his\r\nwishes.\r\n\r\n10. At last, having recovered himself, and being bidden to rise up, he\r\nknelt, and having regained the use of his tongue, he implored pardon for\r\nhis offences. His followers also, whose mouths had been closed by fear\r\nwhile the fate of their leader was still doubtful, were admitted to\r\noffer the same petition, and when he, being commanded to rise, gave them\r\nthe signal which they had been long expecting, to present their\r\npetition, they all threw away their javelins and their shields, and held\r\nout their hands in an attitude of supplication, striving to surpass\r\ntheir prince in the humility of their entreaties.\r\n\r\n11. Among the other Sarmatians the prince had brought with him three\r\nchiefs of tribes, Rumo, Zinafer, and Fragiledus, and many nobles who\r\ncame to offer the same petition with earnest hope of success. And they,\r\nbeing elated at the promise of safety, undertook to make amends for\r\ntheir former deeds of hostility by performing the conditions now imposed\r\non them; giving up willingly into the power of the Romans themselves,\r\ntheir wives and children, and all their possessions. The kindness of the\r\nemperor, united with justice, subdued them; and he bidding them be of\r\ngood cheer and return to their homes, they restored our prisoners. They\r\nalso brought the hostages who were demanded of them, and promised prompt\r\nobedience to all the emperor's commands.\r\n\r\n12. Then, encouraged by this example of our clemency, other chieftains\r\ncame with all their tribe, by name Araharius and Usafer, men of\r\ndistinction among the nobles, and at the head of a great force of their\r\ncountrymen; one of them being chief of a portion of the Quadi who dwelt\r\nbeyond the mountains, and the other of a division of the Sarmatians: the\r\ntwo being united by the proximity of their territories, and their\r\nnatural ferocity. But the emperor, fearing the number of their\r\nfollowers, lest, while pretending to make a treaty, they should suddenly\r\nrise up in arms, separated them; ordering those who were acting for the\r\nSarmatians to retire for a while, while he was examining into the\r\naffairs of Araharius and the Quadi.\r\n\r\n13. And when they presented themselves before him, bowing according to\r\ntheir national custom, as they were not able to clear themselves of\r\nheavy charges, so, fearing extreme punishment, they gave the hostages\r\nwhich were demanded, though they had never before been compelled to give\r\npledges for their fidelity.\r\n\r\n14. These matters being thus equitably and successfully settled, Usafer\r\nwas admitted to offer his petition, though Araharius loudly protested\r\nagainst this, and maintained that the peace ratified with him ought to\r\ncomprehend Usafer also, as an ally of his though of inferior rank, and\r\nsubject to his command.\r\n\r\n15. But when the question was discussed, the Sarmatians were pronounced\r\nindependent of any other power, as having been always vassals of the\r\nRoman empire; and they willingly embraced the proposal of giving\r\nhostages as a pledge of the maintenance of tranquillity.\r\n\r\n16. After this there came a vast number of nations and princes, flocking\r\nin crowds, when they heard that Araharius had been allowed to depart in\r\nsafety, imploring us to withdraw the sword which was at their throats;\r\nand they also obtained the peace which they requested on similar terms,\r\nand without any delay gave as hostages the sons of their nobles whom\r\nthey brought from the interior of the country; and they also\r\nsurrendered, as we insisted, all their prisoners, from whom they parted\r\nas unwillingly as from their own relations.\r\n\r\n17. When these arrangements were completed, the emperor's anxiety was\r\ntransferred to the Sarmatians, who were objects of pity rather than of\r\nanger. It is incredible how much prosperity our connection with their\r\naffairs had brought them, so as to give grounds for really believing,\r\nwhat some persons do imagine, that Fate may be either overcome or\r\ncreated at the will of the emperor.\r\n\r\n18. There were formerly many natives of this kingdom, of high birth and\r\ngreat power, but a secret conspiracy armed their slaves against them;\r\nand as among barbarians all right consists in might, they, as they were\r\nequal to their masters in ferocity, and superior in number, completely\r\novercame them.\r\n\r\n19. And these native chiefs, losing all their wisdom in their fear, fled\r\nto the Victohali,[84] whose settlements were at a great distance,\r\nthinking it better in the choice of evils to become subject to their\r\nprotectors than slaves to their own slaves. But afterwards, when they\r\nhad obtained pardon from us, and had been received as faithful allies,\r\nthey deplored their hard fate, and invoked our direct protection. Moved\r\nby the undeserved hardship of their lot, the emperor, when they were\r\nassembled before him, addressed them with kind words in the presence of\r\nhis army, and commanded them for the future to own no master but himself\r\nand the Roman generals.\r\n\r\n20. And that the restoration of their liberty might carry with it\r\nadditional dignity, he made Zizais their king, a man, as the event\r\nproved, deserving the rewards of eminent fortune, and faithful. After\r\nthese glorious transactions, none of the Sarmatians were allowed to\r\ndepart till all our prisoners had returned, as we had before insisted.\r\n\r\n21. When these matters had been concluded in the territories of the\r\nbarbarians, the camp was moved to Szoeni,[85] that there also the\r\nemperor might, by subjugation or slaughter, terminate the war with the\r\nQuadi, who were keeping that district in a state of agitation. Their\r\nprince Vitrodorus, the son of king Viduarius, and Agilimundus, an\r\ninferior chieftain, with the other nobles and judges who governed the\r\ndifferent tribes, as soon as they saw the imperial army in the bosom of\r\ntheir kingdom and of their native land, threw themselves at the feet of\r\nthe soldiers, and having obtained pardon, promised obedience; and gave\r\ntheir children as hostages for the performance of the conditions imposed\r\nupon them; and drawing their swords, which they worship as deities, they\r\nswore to remain faithful.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. These matters then, as has been related, having been thus\r\nsuccessfully terminated, the public interests required that the army\r\nshould at once march against the Limigantes, the revolted slaves of the\r\nSarmatians, who had perpetrated many atrocities with impunity. For, as\r\nsoon as the countrymen of free blood had attacked us, they also,\r\nforgetful of their former condition, thinking to take advantage of a\r\nfavourable opportunity, burst through the Roman frontier, in this\r\nwickedness alone agreeing with their masters and enemies.\r\n\r\n2. But on deliberation we determined that their offence also should be\r\npunished with more moderation than its greatness deserved; and that\r\nvengeance should limit itself to removing them to a distance where they\r\ncould no longer harass our territories. The consciousness of a long\r\nseries of crimes made them fearful of danger.\r\n\r\n3. And therefore, suspecting that the weight of war was about to fall\r\nupon them, they were prepared, as exigency might require, to resort to\r\nstratagem, arms, or entreaties. But at the first sight of our army they\r\nbecame as it were panic-stricken; and being reduced to despair, they\r\nbegged their lives, offering a yearly tribute, and a body of their\r\nchosen youths for our army, and promising perpetual obedience. But they\r\nwere prepared to refuse if they were ordered to emigrate (as they showed\r\nby their gestures and countenances), trusting to the strength of the\r\nplace where, after they had expelled their masters, they had fixed their\r\nabode.\r\n\r\n4. For the Parthiscus[86] waters this land, proceeding with oblique\r\nwindings till it falls into the Danube. But while it flows unmixed, it\r\npasses through a vast extent of country, which, near its junction with\r\nthe Danube, it narrows into a very small corner, so that over on the\r\nside of the Danube those who live in that district are protected from\r\nthe attack of the Romans, and on the side of the Parthiscus they are\r\nsecured from any irruptions of the barbarians. Since along its course\r\nthe greater part of the ground is frequently under water from the\r\nfloods, and always swampy and full of osiers, so as to be quite\r\nimpassable to strangers; and besides the mainland there is an island\r\nclose to the mouth of the river, which the stream itself seems to have\r\nseparated into its present state.\r\n\r\n5. Accordingly, at the desire of the emperor, they came with native\r\narrogance to our bank of the river, not, as the result showed, with the\r\nintention of obeying his commands, but that they might not seem alarmed\r\nat the presence of his soldiers. And there they stood, stubbornly\r\nshowing that they had come bent on resistance.\r\n\r\n6. And as the emperor had foreseen that this might happen, he secretly\r\ndivided his army into several squadrons, and by the rapidity of their\r\nmovements hemmed in the barbarians between his own lines. And then,\r\nstanding on a mound, with a few of his officers and a small body-guard,\r\nhe gently admonished them not to give way to ferocity.\r\n\r\n7. But they, wavering and in doubt, were agitated by various feelings,\r\nand mingling craft with their fury, they had recourse to arms and to\r\nprayers at the same time. And meditating to make a sudden attack on\r\nthose of our men who were nearest, they threw their shields some\r\ndistance before them, with the intent that while they made some steps\r\nforward to recover them, they might thus steal a little ground without\r\ngiving any indication of their purpose.\r\n\r\n8. And as it was now nearly evening, and the departing light warned us\r\nto avoid further delay, our soldiers raised their standards and fell\r\nupon them with a fiery onset. And they, in close order, directed all\r\ntheir force against the mound on which (as has been already said) the\r\nemperor himself was standing, fixing their eyes on him, and uttering\r\nfierce outcries against him.\r\n\r\n9. Our army was indignant at such insane audacity, and forming into a\r\ntriangle, to which military simplicity has given the name of \"the boar's\r\nhead,\" with a violent charge they scattered the barbarians now pressing\r\nvigorously upon the emperor; on the right our infantry slew their\r\ninfantry, and on the left our cavalry dashed among their squadrons of\r\nlight horsemen.\r\n\r\n10. The prætorian cohort, carefully guarding the emperor, spared neither\r\nthe breasts of those who attacked nor the backs of those who fled, and\r\nthe barbarians, yielding in their stubbornness to death alone, showed by\r\ntheir horrid cries that they grieved not so much at their own death as\r\nat the triumph of our army. And, beside the dead, many lay with their\r\nlegs cut off, and so deprived of the resource of flight, others had lost\r\ntheir hands; some who had received no wound were crushed by the weight\r\nof those who fell upon them, and bore their torments in profound\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n11. Nor, amid all their sufferings, did any one of them ask for mercy,\r\nor throw away his sword, or implore a speedy death, but clinging\r\nresolutely to their arms, wounded as they were, they thought it a lesser\r\nevil to be subdued by the strength of another than by their own\r\nconsciences, and at times they were heard to grumble that what had\r\nhappened was the work of fortune, not of their deserts. And so this\r\nwhole battle was brought to an end in half an hour, in which such\r\nnumbers of barbarians fell that nothing but the fact of our victory\r\nproved that there had been any battle at all.\r\n\r\n12. Those in arms had scarcely been routed when the relations of the\r\ndead, of every age and sex, were brought forward in crowds, having been\r\ndragged from their humble dwellings. And all their former pride being\r\nnow gone, they descended to the lowest depths of servile obedience, and\r\nafter a very short time nothing but barrows of the dead and bands of\r\ncaptives were beheld.\r\n\r\n13. So, the heat of strife and the excitement of victory stimulating our\r\nmen, they rose up to destroy all who had escaped the battle, or who were\r\nlying hidden in their dwellings. And when, eager for the blood of the\r\nbarbarians, our soldiers had reached the spot, they tore to pieces the\r\nslight straw-thatched huts; nor could even the strongest-built cottages,\r\nor the stoutest beams save any one from death.\r\n\r\n14. At last, when everything was set on fire, and when no one could be\r\nconcealed any longer, since every protection for their lives was\r\ndestroyed, they either perished obstinately in the flames, or else, if\r\nthey avoided the fire and sallied out, they only escaped that\r\ndestruction to fall beneath the sword of their enemies.\r\n\r\n15. Some, however, did escape from the weapons of the enemy and from the\r\nspreading flames, and committed themselves to the stream, trusting to\r\ntheir skill in swimming to enable them to reach the further bank; but\r\nmany of them were drowned, and others were transfixed by our javelins,\r\nso that the winding stream of the vast river was discoloured with blood,\r\nand thus, by the agency of both elements, did the indignation and valour\r\nof the conquerors destroy the Sarmatians.\r\n\r\n16. After these events it was determined to leave the barbarians no hope\r\nnor comfort of life; and after burning their houses and carrying off\r\ntheir families, an order was given to collect boats in order to hunt out\r\nthose who, being on the opposite bank of the river, had escaped the\r\nattack of our men.\r\n\r\n17. And immediately, that the alacrity of our warriors might have no\r\ntime to cool, some light-armed troops were embarked in boats, and led by\r\nsecret paths to occupy the retreats of the Sarmatians. The barbarians at\r\nfirst were deceived by seeing only the boats of their own country, and\r\ncrews with whom they were acquainted.\r\n\r\n18. But when the weapons glittered in the distance, and they perceived\r\nthat what they feared was upon them, they sought refuge in their\r\naccustomed marshes. And our soldiers pursuing them with great animosity,\r\nslew numbers of them, and gained a victory in a place where it had not\r\nbeen supposed that any soldier could find a footing, much less do any\r\nbold action.\r\n\r\n19. After the Anicenses[87] had thus been routed and almost destroyed,\r\nwe proceeded at once to attack the Picenses, who are so called from the\r\nregions which they inhabit, which border on one another; and these\r\ntribes had fancied themselves the more secure from the disasters of\r\ntheir allies, which they had heard of by frequent rumours. To crush them\r\n(for it was an arduous task for those who did not know the country to\r\nfollow men scattered in many directions as they were) the aid of\r\nTaifali[88] and of the free-born Sarmatians was sought.\r\n\r\n20. And as the nature of the ground separated the auxiliary battalions\r\nfrom each other, our own troops took the ground nearest Moesia, the\r\nTaifali that nearest to their own settlements, while the free Sarmatians\r\noccupied that in front of their original position.\r\n\r\n21. The Limigantes, alarmed at the still fresh examples of nations\r\nsubdued and crushed by us, for a long time hesitated and wavered whether\r\nthey should attack us or ask for peace, having arguments of no small\r\nweight for either line of conduct. But at last, through the influence of\r\nthe council of the elders, the idea of surrender prevailed; and the\r\nsubmission also of those who had dared to attack their free-born masters\r\nwas added to our numerous victories; and the rest of them, who had\r\npreviously despised their masters, thinking them unwarlike and easily\r\nsubdued, now finding them stronger than themselves, submitted to them.\r\n\r\n22. Accordingly, having received pledges of their safety, and having\r\nquitted the defence of their mountains, the greater portion of them came\r\nwith speed to the Roman camp, and they spread over a vast extent of\r\nground, bringing with them their parents, their children, their wives,\r\nand all the movable treasures which their rapid motions had allowed them\r\nto carry off.\r\n\r\n23. And those who it had been supposed would rather lose their lives\r\nthan quit their country, while they mistook their mad licentiousness for\r\nliberty, now submitted to obey our orders, and to take up another abode\r\nin peace and good faith, so as to be undisturbed for the future by wars\r\nor seditions. And having been thus accepted as subjects, in accordance\r\nwith their own wish as it was believed, they remained quiet for a time;\r\nbut afterwards they broke out in destructive wickedness, as shall be\r\nrelated at the proper time.\r\n\r\n24. While our affairs were thus prospering, Illyricum was put in a\r\nstate of twofold security, since the emperor, in endeavouring by two\r\nmeans to accomplish this object, succeeded in both. He brought back and\r\nestablished in their ancient homes the people who had been banished,\r\nwhom, although they were objects of suspicion from their natural\r\nfickleness, he believed would go on more moderately than of old. And to\r\ncrown this kindness, he set over them as a king, not one of low birth,\r\nbut the very man whom they themselves had formerly chosen, as eminent\r\nfor all the virtues of mind and body.\r\n\r\n25. After such a wise action, Constantius, being now raised above all\r\nfear, and having received from the unanimous consent of his soldiers the\r\ntitle of Sarmaticus, from the name of the nation which he had subdued;\r\nand being now about to leave the army, summoned all his cohorts and\r\ncenturies and maniples, and mounting the tribune, surrounded by the\r\nstandards and eagles, and by a great number of soldiers of all ranks, he\r\naddressed the troops in these words, choosing his topics as usual so as\r\nto gain the favour of all.\r\n\r\n26. \"The recollection of our glorious exploits, the dearest of all\r\nfeelings to brave men, encourages me to repeat, though with great\r\nmoderation, what, in our heaven-granted victories, and before battle,\r\nand in the very heat of the strife, we, the most faithful champions of\r\nthe Roman state, have conducted to a deservedly prosperous issue. For\r\nwhat can be so honourable or so justly worthy to be handed down to the\r\nrecollection of posterity as the exultation of the soldier in his brave\r\ndeeds, and of the general in his wise plans?\r\n\r\n27. \"The rage of our enemies, in their arrogant pride thinking to profit\r\nby our absence, while we were protecting Italy and Gaul, was overrunning\r\nIllyricum, and with continual sallies they were ravaging even the\r\ndistricts beyond our frontiers; crossing the rivers, sometimes in boats\r\nmade of hollow trees, sometimes on foot; not relying on combats, nor on\r\ntheir arms and strength, but being accustomed to secret forays, and\r\nhaving been from the very earliest era of their nation an object of fear\r\nto our ancestors, from their cunning and the variety of their\r\nmanoeuvres, which we indeed, being at a great distance, bore as long\r\nas we could, thinking that the vigour of our generals would be able to\r\nprotect us from even slight injury.\r\n\r\n28. \"But when their licentiousness led them on to bolder attempts, and\r\nto inflict great and frequent injury on our provinces, we, having first\r\nfortified the passes of the Tyrol, and having secured the safety of the\r\nGauls by watchful care, leaving no danger behind us, have marched into\r\nPannonia, in order, with the favour of the everlasting deity, to\r\nstrengthen our tottering interests in that country. And after everything\r\nwas prepared, we set forth, as you know, at the end of the spring, and\r\nundertook a great enterprise; first of all taking care that the\r\ncountless darts of the enemy should not prevent us from making a bridge.\r\nAnd when, with no great trouble, this had been accomplished, after we\r\nhad set our foot upon the enemy's territories, we defeated, with very\r\nlittle loss to ourselves, the Sarmatians, who with obstinate courage set\r\nthemselves to resist us to the death. And we also crushed the Quadi, who\r\nwere bringing reinforcements to the Sarmatians, and who with similar\r\ncourage attacked our noble legions.\r\n\r\n29. \"These tribes, after heavy losses sustained in their attacks, and\r\ntheir stubborn and toilsome resistance, have at length learnt the power\r\nof our valour, and throwing away their arms, have allowed their hands,\r\nprepared for fighting, to be bound behind their backs; and seeing that\r\ntheir only hope of safety is in prayer, have fallen at the feet of your\r\nmerciful emperor, whose wars they found are usually successful. Having\r\ngot rid of these enemies, we with equal courage defeated the Limigantes,\r\nand after we had put numbers of them to the sword, the rest found their\r\nonly means of escaping danger lay in fleeing to their hiding-places in\r\nthe marshes.\r\n\r\n30. \"And when these things were successfully terminated, it seemed to be\r\na seasonable opportunity for mercy. So we compelled the Limigantes to\r\nremove to very distant lands, that they might not be able any more to\r\nmove to our injury; and we spared the greatest part of them. And we made\r\nZizais king over the free-born portion of them, sure that he would be\r\nfaithful to us, and thinking it more honour to create a king for the\r\nbarbarians than to take one from them, the dignity being increased by\r\nthis honourable consideration, that the ruler whom we thus gave them had\r\nbefore been elected and accepted by them.\r\n\r\n31. \"So we and the republic have in one campaign obtained a fourfold\r\nreward: first, vengeance on our guilty assailants; next, abundance of\r\ncaptive slaves from the enemy, for valour is entitled to those rewards\r\nwhich it has earned with its toil and prowess.\r\n\r\n32. \"Thirdly, we have ample resources and great treasures of wealth; our\r\nlabour and courage having preserved the patrimony of each of us\r\nundiminished. This, in the mind of a good sovereign, is the best fruit\r\nof prosperity.\r\n\r\n33. \"Lastly, I myself have the well-won spoil of a surname derived from\r\nthe enemy--the title of Sarmaticus--which you unanimously have (if I may\r\nsay so without arrogance) deservedly conferred on me.\"\r\n\r\n34. After he had made an end of speaking, the whole assembly, with more\r\nalacrity than usual, since its hope of booty and gain was increased,\r\nrose up with joyful voices in praise of the emperor; and, as usual,\r\ncalling God to witness that Constantius was invincible, returned with\r\njoy to their tents. And the emperor was conducted back to his palace,\r\nand having rested two days, re-entered Sirmium with a triumphal\r\nprocession; and the troops returned to their appointed stations.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\n§ 1. About this time Prosper and Spectatus and Eustathius, who, as has\r\nbeen mentioned above, had been sent as ambassadors to the Persians,\r\nfound the Persian king at Ctesiphon, on his return from his campaign,\r\nand they delivered the emperor's letters and presents, and requested\r\npeace while affairs were still in their existing state. And mindful of\r\nwhat had been enjoined them, they never forgot the interests nor the\r\ndignity of the Roman empire, maintaining that the peace ought to be made\r\non the condition that no alteration should be made in the state of\r\nArmenia or Mesopotamia.\r\n\r\n2. And having remained for some time, when they saw that the king was\r\nobstinate, and resolute not to admit of peace unless the absolute\r\ndominion of those regions was assigned to him, they returned without\r\nhaving completed their business.\r\n\r\n3. After which, Lucillianus, a count, and Procopius, at that time\r\nsecretary, were sent to obtain the same conditions, with equal powers.\r\nProcopius being the same man who afterwards, under the pressure of\r\nviolent necessity, committed himself to a revolutionary movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n[70] +Enosichthôn+, +Seisichthôn+, +Ennosigdaios+,\r\nfrom +enothô+ and +seiô+, to shake, and +chthan+\r\nand +gaia+, the earth.\r\n\r\n[71] From +brazô+, to boil over.\r\n\r\n[72] Strabo gives Ophiusa as one of the names of Rhodes, and Homer\r\nmentions the golden shower:--\r\n\r\n  +kai sphin Thespesion ploutou katecheue kroniôn.+--Il. +b+.\r\n  vi. 70.\r\n\r\nAs also does Pindar, Ol. vii. 63.\r\n\r\n[73] From +klinô+, to lay down.\r\n\r\n[74] From +chasma+, a chasm, derived from +chainô+, to\r\ngape.\r\n\r\n[75] This is a tale told by Plato in the Timæus (which is believed to\r\nhave no foundation).\r\n\r\n[76] The destruction of Helice is related in Diodorus Sic. xiv. 48; cf.\r\nOv.

These events took place in the different parts of the world in one\r\nand the same year. But while the affairs in Gaul were in a better state;\r\nand while titles of consul were ennobling the brothers Eusebius and\r\nHypatius, Julian, illustrious for his uninterrupted successes, now in\r\nhis winter quarters, being relieved for a while from his warlike\r\nanxieties, was devoting equal care to many points connected with the\r\nwelfare of the provinces. Taking anxious care that no one should be\r\noppressed by the burden of taxation; that the power of the officers\r\nshould not be stretched into extortion; that those who increase their\r\nproperty by the public distresses, should have no sanction, and that no\r\njudge should violate justice with impunity.\r\n\r\n2. And he found it easy to correct what was wrong on this head, because\r\nhe himself decided all causes in which the persons concerned were of any\r\ngreat importance; and showed himself a most impartial discerner of right\r\nand wrong.\r\n\r\n3. And although there are many acts of his in deciding these disputes\r\nworthy of praise, it will be sufficient to mention one, on the model of\r\nwhich all his other words and actions were framed.\r\n\r\n4. Numerius, a native of Narbonne, had a little time before been accused\r\nbefore the governor as a thief, and Julian, by an unusual exercise of\r\nthe censor's power, heard his cause in public; admitting into the court\r\nall who sought entrance. And when Numerius denied all that was charged\r\nagainst him, and could not be convicted on any point, Delphidius the\r\norator, who was assailing him with great bitterness, being enraged at\r\nthe failure of his charges, exclaimed, \"But, great Cæsar, will any one\r\never be found guilty if it be enough to deny the charge?\" To whom\r\nJulian, with seasonable wisdom, replied, \"Can any one be judged innocent\r\nif it be enough to make a charge?\" And he did many similar actions in\r\nhis civil capacity.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. But when he was about to set out on an important expedition against\r\nsome tribes of the Allemanni whom he considered hostile, and likely to\r\nproceed to acts of atrocious daring if they were not defeated in a way\r\nto be an example to the rest, he hesitated in great anxiety, since a\r\nreport of his intentions had gone before him, what force he could\r\nemploy, and how he could be quick enough to take them by surprise the\r\nfirst moment that circumstances should afford him an opportunity.\r\n\r\n2. But after he had meditated on many different plans, he decided on\r\ntrying one, which the result proved to be good without any one being\r\naware of it. He had sent Hariobaudes, a tribune who at that time had no\r\nparticular command, a man of honour, loyalty, and courage, under pretext\r\nof an embassy, to Hortarius the king who was now in a state of\r\nfriendship with us; in order that from his court Hariobaudes might\r\neasily proceed to the frontiers of the enemy whom he was proposing to\r\nattack; and so ascertain what they were about, being thoroughly skilled\r\nin the language of the barbarians.\r\n\r\n3. And when he had gone boldly on this commission, Julian himself, as it\r\nwas now a favourable time of the year, assembled his soldiers from all\r\nquarters for the expedition, and set out; thinking it above all things\r\ndesirable, before the war had got warm, to effect his entrance into the\r\ncities which had been destroyed some time before, and having recovered\r\nthem to put them in a state of defence; and also to establish granaries\r\nin the place of those which had been burnt, in which to store the corn\r\nusually imported from Britain.\r\n\r\n4. Both these objects were accomplished, and that more speedily than\r\ncould have been looked for. For the store-houses were rapidly built, and\r\nabundance of provisions laid up in them; and seven cities were occupied.\r\nThe camp of Hercules, Quadriburgium,[89] Kellen, Nuys, Bonn, Andernach,\r\nand Bingen. At which last city, by exceedingly good fortune, Florentius\r\nthe prefect also arrived unexpectedly, bringing with him a division of\r\nsoldiers, and a supply of provisions sufficient to last a long time.\r\n\r\n5. After this, the next measure of urgent necessity was to repair the\r\nwalls of the recovered cities, while as yet no one raised any hindrance;\r\nand it is abundantly plain that at that time the barbarians did out of\r\nfear what was commanded them for the public interests, while the Romans\r\ndid it for love of their ruler.\r\n\r\n6. According to the treaty made in the preceding year, the kings sent\r\ntheir own waggons with many articles useful for building. And the\r\nauxiliary soldiers who always hold themselves above employments of this\r\nkind being won over by Julian's caresses to diligent obedience, now\r\ncarried beams fifty feet long and more on their shoulders, and gave the\r\ngreatest aid to the labours of the architect.\r\n\r\n7. And while all this was being done with diligence and speed,\r\nHariobaudes, having learnt all he wanted, returned and related what he\r\nhad ascertained. And after his arrival the army marched with all speed,\r\nand soon reached Mayence, where, though Florentius and Lupicinus, who\r\nsucceeded Severus, insisted vehemently that they might cross by the\r\nbridge laid down at that town, the Cæsar strenuously objected,\r\nmaintaining that it was not well to trample on the lands of those who\r\nwere brought into a state of tranquillity and friendship; lest the\r\ntreaty made with them should be brought to an abrupt end, as had often\r\nhappened through the discourtesy of the soldiers ravaging everything\r\nthat came in their way.\r\n\r\n8. But all the Allemanni who were the objects of our attack, seeing the\r\ndanger now on their borders, with many threats urged Surmarius their\r\nking, who by a previous treaty was on friendly terms with us, to prevent\r\nthe Romans from crossing the river. For their villages were on the\r\neastern bank of the Rhine. But when Surmarius affirmed that he by\r\nhimself was unable to offer effectual resistance, the barbarian host\r\nassembled in a body, and came up to Mayence, intending by main force to\r\nprevent our army from crossing the river.\r\n\r\n9. So that Cæsar's advice now seemed best in two points, both not to\r\nravage the lands of our friends; and also, not in the teeth of the\r\nopposition of a most warlike people, to risk the loss of many lives in\r\norder to make a bridge, even in a spot the most favourable for such a\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n10. And the enemy, watching his movements with great skill, marched\r\nslowly along the opposite bank, and when they saw our men pitching their\r\ntents at a distance, they still watched all night, exerting the most\r\nsleepless vigilance to prevent the passage of the river from being\r\nattempted.\r\n\r\n11. But when our men reached the spot intended, they surrounded their\r\ncamp with a rampart and ditch, and took their rest; and the Cæsar,\r\nhaving taken counsel with Lupicinus, ordered some of the tribunes to get\r\nready three hundred light-armed soldiers with stakes, without letting\r\nthem know what was to be done, or whither they were going.\r\n\r\n12. They being collected, when the night was well advanced, and being\r\nall embarked on board of forty light boats, which were all that were at\r\nhand, were ordered to go down the stream so silently as not to use even\r\ntheir oars, lest the noise should rouse the barbarians, and then using\r\nall activity both of mind and body, to force a landing on the opposite\r\nbank, within the frontier of the enemy, while they were still watching\r\nthe camp-fires of our men.\r\n\r\n13. While these orders were being performed with great promptness, King\r\nHortarius, who had been previously bound to us by treaties, and was\r\nwithout any intention of revolting, kept on friendly terms with the\r\nbordering tribes, having invited all their kings, princes, and\r\nchieftains to a banquet, detained them to the third watch, the banquet\r\nbeing prolonged so late according to the custom of his nation. And as\r\nthey were departing, our men chanced to come upon them suddenly, but\r\ncould neither stay nor capture any of them owing to the darkness of the\r\nnight and the fleetness of their horses, on which they fled at random in\r\nall directions. A number of sutlers and slaves, however, who were\r\nfollowing them on foot, our men slew; the few who escaped being likewise\r\nprotected by the darkness of the hour.\r\n\r\n14. When it became known that the Romans had crossed the river (and they\r\nthen as well as in all former expeditions accounted it a great relief to\r\ntheir labours when they could find the enemy), the kings and their\r\npeople, who were watching zealously to prevent the bridge from being\r\nmade, were alarmed, and being panic-stricken fled in all directions, and\r\ntheir violent fury being thus cooled, they hastened to remove their\r\nrelations and their treasures to a distance. And as all difficulties\r\nwere now surmounted, the bridge was at once made, and before the\r\nbarbarians could expect it, the Roman army appeared in their\r\nterritories, and passed through the dominions of Hortarius without doing\r\nany injury.\r\n\r\n15. But when they reached the lands of those kings who were still\r\nhostile, they went on invincibly through the midst of their rebellious\r\ncountry, laying waste with fire and sword, and plundering everything.\r\nAnd after their frail houses were destroyed by fire, and a vast number\r\nof men had been slain, and the army, having nothing to face but corpses\r\nand suppliants, had arrived in the region called Capellatum, or Palas,\r\nwhere there are boundary stones marking the frontiers of the Allemanni\r\nand the Burgundians; the army pitched its camp, in order that Macrianus\r\nand Hariobaudus, brothers, and both kings, might be received by us, and\r\ndelivered from their fears. Since they, thinking their destruction\r\nimminent, were coming with great anxiety to sue for peace.\r\n\r\n16. And immediately after them King Vadomarius also came, whose abode\r\nwas opposite Augst: and having produced some letters of the Emperor\r\nConstantius, in which he was strictly recommended to the protection of\r\nthe Romans, he was courteously received, as became one who had been\r\nadmitted by the emperor as a client of the Roman empire.\r\n\r\n17. And Macrianus and his brother, being admitted among our eagles and\r\nstandards, marvelled at the imposing appearance of our arms, and various\r\nresources which they had never seen before. And they offered up\r\npetitions on behalf of their people. But Vadomarius, who had met us\r\nbefore, since he was close to our frontier, admired indeed the\r\nappointments of our daring expedition, but remembered that he had often\r\nseen such before, ever since his childhood.\r\n\r\n18. At last, after long deliberation, with the unanimous consent of all,\r\npeace was granted to Macrianus and Hariobaudus; but an answer could not\r\nbe given to Vadomarius, who had come to secure his own safety, and also\r\nas an ambassador to intercede for the kings Urius, Ursicinus, and\r\nVestralpus, imploring peace for them also; lest, as the barbarians are\r\nmen of wavering faith, they might recover their spirits when our army\r\nwas withdrawn, and refuse adherence to conditions procured by the agency\r\nof others.\r\n\r\n19. But when they also, after their crops and houses had been burnt, and\r\nmany of their soldiers had been slain or taken prisoners, sent\r\nambassadors of their own, and sued for mercy as if they had been guilty\r\nof similar violence to our subjects, they obtained peace on similar\r\nterms; of which that most rigorously insisted on was that they should\r\nrestore all the prisoners which they had taken in their frequent\r\nincursions.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. While the god-like wisdom of the Cæsar was thus successful in Gaul,\r\ngreat disturbances arose in the court of the emperor, which from slight\r\nbeginnings increased to grief and lamentations. Some bees swarmed on the\r\nhouse of Barbatio, at that time the commander of the infantry. And when\r\nhe consulted the interpreters of prodigies on this event, he received\r\nfor an answer, that it was an omen of great danger; the answer being\r\nfounded on the idea that these animals, after they have fixed their\r\nabode, and laid up their stores, are usually expelled by smoke and the\r\nnoisy din of cymbals.\r\n\r\n2. Barbatio's wife was a woman called Assyria, neither silent nor\r\nprudent. And when he had gone on an expedition which caused her much\r\nalarm, she, because of the predictions which she recollected to have\r\nbeen given her, and being full of female vanity, having summoned a\r\nhandmaid who was skilful in writing, and of whom she had become\r\npossessed by inheritance from her father Silvanus, sent an unseasonable\r\nletter to her husband, full of lamentations, and of entreaties that\r\nafter the approaching death of Constantius, if he himself, as she hoped,\r\nwas admitted to a share in the empire, he would not despise her, and\r\nprefer to marry Eusebia, who was Constantius's empress, and who was of a\r\nbeauty equalled by few women.\r\n\r\n3. She sent this letter as secretly as she could; but the maid, when the\r\ntroops had returned from their expedition at the beginning of the night,\r\ntook a copy of the letter which she had written at the dictation of her\r\nmistress, to Arbetio, and being eagerly admitted by him, she gave him\r\nthe paper.\r\n\r\n4. He, relying on this evidence, being at all times a man eager to bring\r\nforward accusations, conveyed it to the emperor. As was usual, no delay\r\nwas allowed, and Barbatio, who confessed that he had received the\r\nletter, and his wife, who was distinctly proved to have written it, were\r\nboth beheaded.\r\n\r\n5. After this execution, investigations were carried further, and many\r\npersons, innocent as well as guilty, were brought into question. Among\r\nwhom was Valentinus, who having lately been an officer of the\r\nprotectores, had been promoted to be a tribune; and he with many others\r\nwas put to the torture as having been privy to the affair, though he was\r\nwholly ignorant of it. But he survived his sufferings; and as some\r\ncompensation for the injury done to him, and for his danger, he received\r\nthe rank of duke of Illyricum.\r\n\r\n6. This same Barbatio was a man of rude and arrogant manners, and very\r\nunpopular, because while captain of the protectores of the household, in\r\nthe time of Gallus Cæsar, he was a false and treacherous man; and after\r\nhe had attained the higher rank he became so elated that he invented\r\ncalumnies against the Cæsar Julian, and, though all good men hated him,\r\nwhispered many wicked lies into the ever-ready ears of the emperor.\r\n\r\n7. Being forsooth ignorant of the wise old saying of Aristotle, who when\r\nhe sent Callisthenes, his pupil and relation, to the king Alexander,\r\nwarned him to say as little as he could, and that only of a pleasant\r\nkind, before a man who carried the power of life and death on the tip of\r\nhis tongue.\r\n\r\n8. We should not wonder that mankind, whose minds we look upon as akin\r\nto those of the gods, can sometimes discern what is likely to be\r\nbeneficial or hurtful to them, when even animals devoid of reason\r\nsometimes secure their own safety by profound silence, of which the\r\nfollowing is a notorious instance:--\r\n\r\n9. When the wild geese leave the East because of the heat, and seek a\r\nwestern climate, as soon as they reach Mount Taurus, which is full of\r\neagles, fearing those warlike birds, they stop up their own beaks with\r\nstones, that not even the hardest necessity may draw a cry from them;\r\nthey fly more rapidly than usual across that range, and when they have\r\npassed it they throw away the stones, and then proceed more securely.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n§ 1. While these investigations were being carried on with great\r\ndiligence at Sirmium, the fortune of the East sounded the terrible\r\ntrumpet of danger. For the king of Persia, being strengthened by the aid\r\nof the fierce nations whom he had lately subdued, and being above all\r\nmen ambitious of extending his territories, began to prepare men and\r\narms and supplies, mingling hellish wisdom with his human counsels, and\r\nconsulting all kinds of soothsayers about futurity. And when he had\r\ncollected everything, he proposed to invade our territories at the first\r\nopening of the spring.\r\n\r\n2. And when the emperor learnt this, at first by report, but\r\nsubsequently by certain intelligence, and while all were in suspense\r\nfrom dread of the impending danger, the dependents of the court,\r\nhammering on the same anvil day and night (as the saying is), at the\r\nprompting of the eunuchs, held up Ursicinus as a Gorgon's head before\r\nthe suspicious and timid emperor, continually repeating that, because on\r\nthe death of Silvanus, in a dearth of better men, he had been sent to\r\ndefend the eastern districts, he had become ambitious of still greater\r\npower.\r\n\r\n3. And by this base compliance many tried to purchase the favour of\r\nEusebius, at that time the principal chamberlain, with whom (if we are\r\nto say the real truth) Constantius had great influence, and who was now\r\na bitter enemy of the safety of the master of the horse, Ursicinus, on\r\ntwo accounts; first, because he was the only person who did not need his\r\nassistance, as others did; and secondly, because he would not give up\r\nhis house at Antioch, which Eusebius greatly coveted.\r\n\r\n4. So this latter, like a snake abounding in poison, and exciting its\r\noffspring as soon as they can crawl to do mischief, stirred up the other\r\nchamberlains, that they, while performing their more private duties\r\nabout the prince's person, with their thin and boyish voices, might\r\ndamage the reputation of a brave man by pouring into the too open ears\r\nof the emperor accusations of great odium. And they soon did what they\r\nwere commanded.\r\n\r\n5. Disgust at this and similar events leads one to praise Domitian, who\r\nalthough, by the unalterable detestation he incurred, has ever stained\r\nthe memory of his father and his brother,[90] still deserved credit for\r\na most excellent law, by which he forbade with severe threats any one to\r\ncastrate any boy within the limits of the Roman jurisdiction. For if\r\nthere were no such edict, who could endure the swarms of such creatures\r\nas would exist, when it is so difficult to bear even a few of them?\r\n\r\n6. However, they proceeded with caution, lest, as Eusebius suggested, if\r\nUrsicinus were again sent for, he should take alarm and throw everything\r\ninto confusion; but it was proposed that on the first casual opportunity\r\nhe should be put to death.\r\n\r\n7. While they were waiting for this chance, and full of doubt and\r\nanxiety; and while we[91] were tarrying a short time at Samosata, the\r\ngreatest city of what had formerly been the kingdom of Commagene, we\r\nsuddenly received frequent and consistent reports of some new\r\ncommotions, which I will now proceed to relate.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n§ 1. A certain man named Antoninus, who from having been a wealthy\r\nmerchant had become superintendent of the accounts of the duke of\r\nMesopotamia, and after that entered the corps of the protectores, a man\r\nof experience and wisdom, and very well known in all that country. Being\r\nthrough the avarice of certain persons involved in heavy losses, and\r\nperceiving that while defending actions against men of influence he was\r\nbeing sunk lower and lower through injustice, since the judges who had\r\nto decide on his affairs sought to gratify people in power, he, not\r\nwishing to kick against the pricks, bent himself to obsequious caresses;\r\nand confessing that he owed what was claimed of him, the claim, by\r\ncollusion, was transferred to the treasury. He now, having resolved on a\r\nflagitious plan, began secretly to look into the secrets of the whole\r\nrepublic; and being acquainted with both languages, he devoted his\r\nattention to the accounts; remarking the amount, quality, and situation\r\nof the different divisions of the army, and the employment of them on\r\nany expeditions; inquiring also with unwearied diligence into the extent\r\nof the supplies of arms and provisions, and other things likely to be\r\nneedful in war.\r\n\r\n2. And when he had made himself acquainted with all the internal\r\ncircumstances of the East, and had learnt that a great portion of the\r\ntroops and of the money for their pay was distributed in Illyricum,\r\nwhere the emperor himself was detained by serious business; as the day\r\nwas now approaching which had been fixed for the payment of the money\r\nfor which he had been constrained by fear to give an acknowledgment of\r\nhis bond; and as he saw that he must be overwhelmed by disasters on all\r\nsides, since the chief treasurer was devoted to the interests of his\r\nadversary; he conceived the audacious design of crossing over to the\r\nPersians with his wife and children, and his whole numerous family of\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\n3. And to elude the observation of the soldiers at their different\r\nstations, he bought for a small price a farm in Hiaspis, a district on\r\nthe banks of the Tigris. And, relying on this pretext, since no one\r\nwould venture to ask why a landed proprietor should go to the extreme\r\nfrontier of the Roman territory, as many others did the same, by the\r\nagency of some trusty friends who were skilful swimmers, he carried on\r\nfrequent secret negotiations with Tamsapor, who was at that time\r\ngoverning the country on the other side of the river with the rank of\r\nduke, and with whom he was already acquainted. And at last, having\r\nreceived from the Persian camp an escort of well-mounted men, he\r\nembarked in some boats, and crossed over at night with all his family,\r\nin the same manner as Zopyrus, the betrayer of Babylon, had formerly\r\ndone, only with an opposite object.\r\n\r\n4. While affairs in Mesopotamia were in this state, the hangers-on of\r\nthe palace, always singing the same song for our destruction, at last\r\nfound a handle to injure the gallant Ursicinus; the gang of eunuchs\r\nbeing still the contrivers and promoters of the plot; since they are\r\nalways sour tempered and savage, and having no relations, cling to\r\nriches as their dearest kindred.\r\n\r\n5. The design now adopted was to send Sabinianus, a withered old man of\r\ngreat wealth, but infirm and timid, and from the lowness of his birth\r\nfar removed from any office of command, to govern the districts of the\r\nEast; while Ursicinus should be recalled to court, to command the\r\ninfantry, as successor to Barbatio. And then he, this greedy promoter of\r\nrevolution, as they called him, being within their reach, could easily\r\nbe attacked by his bitter and formidable enemies.\r\n\r\n6. While these things were going on in the camp of Constantius, as at a\r\nfestival or a theatre, and while the dispensers of rank which was bought\r\nand sold were distributing the price agreed upon among the influential\r\nhouses, Antoninus, having reached Sapor's winter quarters, was received\r\nwith gladness; and being ennobled by the grant of a turban, an honour\r\nwhich gives admission to the royal table, and also that of assisting at\r\nand delivering one's opinion in the councils of the Persians, went\r\nonwards, not with a punt pole or a tar rope, as the proverb is (that is\r\nto say, not by any tedious or circuitous path), but with flowing sails\r\ninto the conduct of state affairs, and stirring up Sapor, as formerly\r\nMaharbal roused the sluggish Hannibal, was always telling him that he\r\nknew how to conquer, but not how to use a victory.\r\n\r\n7. For having been bred up in active life, and being a thorough man of\r\nbusiness, he got possession of the feelings of his hearers, who like\r\nwhat tickles their ears, and who do not utter their praises aloud, but,\r\nlike the Phæacians in Homer, admire in silence,[92] while he recounted\r\nthe events of the last forty years; urging that, after all these\r\ncontinual wars, and especially the battles of Hileia and Singara,[93]\r\nwhere that fierce combat by night took place, in which we lost a vast\r\nnumber of our men, as if some fecial had interposed to stop them, the\r\nPersians, though victorious, had never advanced as far as Edessa or the\r\nbridges over the Euphrates. Though with their warlike power and\r\nsplendid success, they might have pushed their advances especially at\r\nthat moment, when in consequence of the protracted troubles of their\r\ncivil wars the blood of the Romans was being poured out on all sides.\r\n\r\n8. By these and similar speeches the deserter, preserving his sobriety\r\nat the banquets, where, after the fashion of the ancient Greeks, the\r\nPersians deliberate on war and other important affairs, stimulated the\r\nfiery monarch, and persuaded him to rely upon the greatness of his\r\nfortune, and to take up arms the moment that the winter was over, and he\r\nhimself boldly promised his assistance in many important matters.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n§ 1. About this time Sabinianus, being elated at the power which he had\r\nsuddenly acquired, and having arrived in Cilicia, gave his predecessor\r\nletters from the emperor, desiring him to hasten to court to be invested\r\nwith higher dignities. In fact the affairs of Asia were in such a state\r\nthat, even if Ursicinus had been at Ultima Thule their urgency would\r\nhave required him to be summoned thence to set them right, since he was\r\na man of the ancient discipline, and from long experience especially\r\nskilful in the Persian manner of conducting war.\r\n\r\n2. But when the report of this reached the provinces, all ranks of the\r\ncitizens and agricultural population, by formal edicts and by unanimous\r\noutcries, endeavoured to detain him, almost forcibly, as the public\r\ndefender of their country, remembering that though for ten years he had\r\nbeen left to his own resources with a scanty and unwarlike force, he had\r\nyet incurred no loss; and fearing for their safety if at so critical a\r\ntime he should be removed and a man of utter inactivity assume the rule\r\nin his stead.\r\n\r\n3. We believe, and indeed there is no doubt of it, that fame flies on\r\nwings through the paths of the air; and she it was who now gave\r\ninformation of these events to the Persians while deliberating on the\r\nentire aspect of affairs. At last, after many arguments pro and con,\r\nthey determined, on the advice of Antoninus, that as Ursicinus was\r\nremoved, and as the new governor was contemptible, they might venture\r\nto neglect laying siege to cities, an operation which would cause a\r\nmischievous loss of time, and at once cross the Euphrates, and advance\r\nfurther, in order, outstripping all rumour of their march, to occupy\r\nthose provinces which, throughout all our wars, had always been safe\r\n(except in the time of Gallienus), and which, from their long enjoyment\r\nof peace, were very wealthy. And in this enterprise, with the favour of\r\nGod, Antoninus offered himself as a most desirable guide.\r\n\r\n4. His advice, therefore, being unanimously praised and adopted, and the\r\nattention of the whole nation being directed to the speedy collection of\r\nthose things which were required, supplies, soldiers, arms, and\r\nequipments, the preparation of everything for the coming campaign was\r\ncontinued the whole winter.\r\n\r\n5. In the mean time, we, hastening at the emperor's command towards\r\nItaly, after having been detained a short time on the western side of\r\nMount Taurus, reached the river Hebrus, which descends from the\r\nmountains of the Odrysæ[94], and there we received letters from the\r\nemperor, ordering us, without the least delay, to return to Mesopotamia,\r\nwithout any officers, and having, indeed, no important duty to\r\ndischarge, since all the power had been transferred to another.\r\n\r\n6. And this had been arranged by those mischievous meddlers in the\r\ngovernment, in order that if the Persians failed and returned to their\r\nown country, our success might be attributed to the valour of the new\r\ngovernor; while, if our affairs turned out ill, Ursicinus might be\r\nimpeached as a traitor to the republic.\r\n\r\n7. Accordingly we, being tossed about without any reason, after much\r\ntime had been lost, returned, and found Sabinianus, a man full of pride,\r\nof small stature, and of a petty and narrow mind, scarcely able without\r\nfear to encounter the slight noise of a beast, much less to face the\r\ncrash of battle.\r\n\r\n8. Nevertheless, since our spies brought positive and consistent\r\nintelligence that all kind of preparations were going on among the\r\nenemy, and since their report was confirmed by that of the deserters,\r\nwhile this manikin was in a state of perplexity, we hastened to Nisibis\r\nto make such preparation as seemed requisite, lest the Persians, while\r\nconcealing their intention to besiege it, should come upon it by\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n9. And while all things necessary were being pressed forward within the\r\nwalls, continued fires and columns of smoke being seen on the other side\r\nof the Tigris, near the town called the Camp of the Moors, and Sisara,\r\nand the other districts on the Persian frontier, and spreading up to the\r\ncity itself, showed that the predatory bands of the enemy had crossed\r\nthe river, and entered our territories.\r\n\r\n10. And therefore we hastened forwards with a forced march, to prevent\r\nthe roads from being occupied; and when we had advanced two miles, we\r\nsaw a fine boy of about eight years old, as we guessed, wearing a\r\nnecklace, of noble appearance, standing on the top of a small hillock,\r\nand crying out, stating himself to be the son of a man of noble birth,\r\nwhom his mother, while fleeing in her alarm at the approach of the\r\nenemy, had left in her panic in order to be less encumbered. We pitied\r\nhim, and at the command of our general, I put him on my horse, in front\r\nof me, and took him back to the city, while the predatory bands of the\r\nenemy, having blockaded the city, were ravaging all around.\r\n\r\n11. And because I was alarmed at the difficulties in which we should be\r\nplaced by a blockade, I put the child in at a half open postern gate,\r\nand hastened back with all speed to my troop. And I was very nearly\r\ntaken prisoner; for a tribune named Abdigidus, accompanied by a groom,\r\nwas fleeing, pursued by a squadron of cavalry, and though the master\r\nescaped the servant was taken. And as I was passing by rapidly, they,\r\nexamining the servant, inquired of him who was the chief who had\r\nadvanced against them; and when they heard that Ursicinus had a little\r\nwhile before entered the city, and was on his way to Mount Izala, they\r\nput their informant to death, and then, forming into one body, pursued\r\nus with ceaseless speed.\r\n\r\n12. But I outstripped them by the speed of my horse, and finding my\r\ncomrades reposing securely under the walls of a slight fort, called\r\nAmudis, with their horses dispersed over the grass, I waved my hand, and\r\nraising the hem of my cloak: by this usual signal I gave notice that\r\nthe enemy was at hand, and then joining them we retreated together,\r\nthough my horse was greatly fatigued.\r\n\r\n13. Our alarm was increased by the brightness of the night, as the moon\r\nwas full, and by the even level of the plain, which, if our danger\r\nshould become worse, afforded no possible hiding-place, as having\r\nneither trees, nor bushes, nor anything but low herbage.\r\n\r\n14. Accordingly we adopted the following plan: we lit a lamp and\r\nfastened it tightly on a horse, which we turned loose without a rider,\r\nand let go where it pleased to our left, while we marched towards the\r\nhigh ground on our right, in order that the Persians might fancy the\r\nlight a torch held before the general as he proceeded slowly forwards,\r\nand so keep on in that direction. And unless we had adopted this\r\nprecaution we should have been circumvented, and have fallen as\r\nprisoners into the power of the enemy.\r\n\r\n15. Being delivered from this danger, when we had come to a woody spot,\r\nfull of vines and fruit-bearing trees, called Meiacarire, a name derived\r\nfrom the cool springs found there, we found that the inhabitants had all\r\nfled, and there was only a single soldier remaining behind, concealed in\r\na remote corner. And when he was brought before our general, and through\r\nfear told all kinds of different stories, and so became an object of\r\nsuspicion; at last, under the compulsion of our threats, he told the\r\nreal truth, that he was a native of Gaul, and had been born among the\r\nParisii, that he had served in our cavalry, but that fearing punishment\r\nfor some offence he had deserted to the Persians; that he had since\r\nmarried a wife of excellent character, and had a family, and that having\r\nbeen frequently sent as a spy to our camp, he had always brought the\r\nPersians true intelligence. And now he said he had been sent by the\r\nnobles Tamsapor and Nohodares, who were in command of the predatory\r\nbands, to bring them such intelligence as he could collect. After\r\ntelling us this, and also that he knew of the operations of the enemy,\r\nhe was put to death.\r\n\r\n16. Afterwards, as our anxiety increased, we proceeded from thence with\r\nas much speed as we could make to Amida, a city celebrated at a later\r\nperiod for the disaster which befel it. And when our scouts had rejoined\r\nus there we found in one of their scabbards a scrap of parchment\r\nwritten in cipher, which they had been ordered to convey to us by\r\nProcopius, whom I have already spoken of as ambassador to the Persians\r\nwith the Count Lucillianus; its terms were purposely obscure, lest if\r\nthe bearers should be taken prisoners, and the sense of the writing\r\nunderstood, materials should be found for fatal mischief.\r\n\r\n17. The purport was, \"The ambassadors of the Greeks, having been\r\nrejected, and being perhaps to be put to death, the aged king, not\r\ncontented with the Hellespont, will throw bridges over the Granicus and\r\nthe Rhyndacus, and invade Asia Minor with a numerous host, being by his\r\nown natural disposition irritable and fierce; and being now prompted and\r\ninflamed by him who was formerly the successor of the Roman emperor\r\nHadrian,[95] it is all over with the Greeks if they do not take care.\"\r\n\r\n18. The meaning of this was that the Persian king, having crossed the\r\nrivers Anzaba and Tigris, at the prompting of Antoninus was aiming at\r\nthe sovereignty of the entire East. When it had been interpreted with\r\ndifficulty, from its great obscurity, a wise plan was decided on.\r\n\r\n19. The satrap of Corduena, a province under the authority of the\r\nPersians, was a man named Jovinianus, who had grown up to manhood in the\r\nRoman territories, and was secretly friendly to us, because he had been\r\ndetained as a hostage in Syria, and being now allured by the love of\r\nliberal studies, he was exceedingly desirous to return among us.\r\n\r\n20. To this man I, being sent with a faithful centurion, for the purpose\r\nof learning with greater certainty what was being done, reached him by\r\ntravelling over pathless mountains, and dangerous defiles. And when he\r\nsaw and recognized me, he received me courteously, and I avowed to him\r\nalone the reason of my coming; and having received from him a silent\r\nguide, well acquainted with the country, I was sent to some lofty rocks\r\nat a distance, from which, if one's eyes did not fail, one could see\r\neven the most minute object fifty miles off.\r\n\r\n21. There we remained two whole days; and on the morning of the third\r\nday we saw all the circuit of the earth, which we call the horizon,\r\nfilled with countless hosts of men, and the king marching before them\r\nglittering with the brilliancy of his robes. And next to him on his left\r\nhand marched Grumbates, king of the Chionitæ, a man of middle age, and\r\nwrinkled limbs, but of a grand spirit, and already distinguished for\r\nmany victories. On his right hand was the king of the Albani, of equal\r\nrank and splendour. After them came various generals, renowned for their\r\nrank and power, who were followed by a multitude of all classes, picked\r\nfrom the flower of the neighbouring nations, and trained by long\r\nhardship to endure any toil or danger.\r\n\r\n22. How long, O mendacious Greece, wilt thou tell us of Doriscus,[96]\r\nthe Thracian town, and of the army counted there in battalions in a\r\nfenced space, when we careful, or to speak more truly, cautious\r\nhistorians, exaggerate nothing, and merely record what is established by\r\nevidence neither doubtful nor uncertain!\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. After the kings had passed by Nineveh, an important city of the\r\nprovince of Adiabene, they offered a sacrifice in the middle of the\r\nbridge over the Anzaba, and as the omens were favourable, they advanced\r\nwith great joy; while we, calculating that the rest of their host could\r\nhardly pass over in three days, returned with speed to the satrap, and\r\nrested, refreshing ourselves by his hospitable kindness.\r\n\r\n2. And returning from thence through a deserted and solitary country,\r\nunder the pressure of great necessity, and reaching our army more\r\nrapidly than could have been expected, we brought to those who were\r\nhesitating the certain intelligence that the kings had crossed over the\r\nriver by a bridge of boats, and were marching straight towards us.\r\n\r\n3. Without delay, therefore, horsemen with horses of picked speed were\r\nsent to Cassianus, duke of Mesopotamia, and to Euphronius, at that time\r\nthe governor of the province, to compel the residents in the country to\r\nretire with their families and all their flocks to a safer place; and\r\nto quit at once the town of Carræ, which was defended by very slight\r\nwalls; and further, to burn all the standing crops, that the enemy might\r\nget no supplies from the land.\r\n\r\n4. And when these orders had been executed, as they were without delay,\r\nand when the fire was kindled, the violence of the raging element so\r\ncompletely destroyed all the corn,[97] which was just beginning to swell\r\nand turn yellow, and all the young herbage, that from the Euphrates to\r\nthe Tigris nothing green was to be seen. And many wild beasts were\r\nburnt, and especially lions, who infest these districts terribly, but\r\nwho are often destroyed or blinded in this manner.\r\n\r\n5. They wander in countless droves among the beds of rushes on the banks\r\nof the rivers of Mesopotamia, and in the jungles; and lie quiet all the\r\nwinter, which is very mild in that country. But when the warm weather\r\nreturns, as these regions are exposed to great heat, they are forced out\r\nby the vapours, and by the size of the gnats, with swarms of which every\r\npart of that country is filled. And these winged insects attack the\r\neyes, as being both moist and sparkling, sitting on and biting the\r\neyelids; the lions, unable to bear the torture, are either drowned in\r\nthe rivers, to which they flee for refuge, or else by frequent\r\nscratchings tear their eyes out themselves with their claws, and then\r\nbecome mad. And if this did not happen the whole of the East would be\r\noverrun with beasts of this kind.\r\n\r\n6. While the plains were thus being laid waste by fire, as I have\r\ndescribed, the tribunes, who were sent with a body of protectores,\r\nfortified all the western bank of the Euphrates with castles and sharp\r\npalisades and every kind of defence, fixing also large engines for\r\nhurling missiles on those spots where the more tranquil condition of the\r\nriver made it likely that the enemy might attempt to cross.\r\n\r\n7. While these things were being expeditiously done, Sabinianus, chosen\r\nin the hurried moment of general danger as the fittest conductor of an\r\ninternecine war, was living luxuriously, according to his custom, at the\r\ntombs of Edessa,[98] as if he had established peace with the dead, and\r\nhad nothing to fear: and he took especial pleasure in breaking the\r\nsilence of the place with the sounding measures of the martial\r\npyathicari, instead of the usual theatrical exhibitions; a fancy,\r\nconsidering the place, pregnant with omens. Since these and similar\r\ngloomy scenes foreshow future commotions, as we learn in the progress of\r\ntime, all good men ought to avoid them.\r\n\r\n8. In the mean time, passing by Nisibis as of no importance, while the\r\nconflagration increased through the dryness of the crops, the kings,\r\ndreading a scarcity of food, marched through the grassy valleys at the\r\nfoot of the mountains.\r\n\r\n9. When they had arrived at a small place called Bebase (from which\r\nplace to the town of Constantina, which is one hundred miles distant,\r\nthe whole country is an arid desert, except where a little water is\r\nfound in some wells), they hesitated for some time, doubting what to do;\r\nand at last resolving to proceed in reliance on the endurance of their\r\nmen, they learnt from a trusty spy that the Euphrates was swollen by the\r\nmelting of the snow, and was now extensively inundating the adjacent\r\nlands, and so could not possibly be forded.\r\n\r\n10. Therefore they turned to see what opportunities chance might afford\r\nthem, being now cut off unexpectedly from the hope which they had\r\nconceived. And in the present emergency a council was held, at which\r\nAntoninus was requested to give his advice: and he counselled them to\r\ndirect their march to the right, so that by a longer circuit they might\r\nreach the two strong forts of Barzala and Laudias, to which he could\r\nguide them through a region fertile in everything, and still\r\nundestroyed, since the march of the army was expected to be made in a\r\nstraight line. And the only river on their road was one small and\r\nnarrow, to be passed near its source, before it was increased by any\r\nother streams, and easily fordable.\r\n\r\n11. When they had heard this, they praised their adviser, and bidding\r\nhim lead the way, the whole army turned from its previously appointed\r\nline, and followed his guidance.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. When our generals received intelligence of this from their spies,\r\nwe settled to march in haste to Samosata, in order to cross the river at\r\nthat point, and destroying the bridges at Zeugma and Capersana, to check\r\nthe invasion of the enemy if we could find a favourable chance for\r\nattacking them.\r\n\r\n2. But we met with a sad disaster, worthy to be buried in profound\r\nsilence. For two squadrons of cavalry, of about seven hundred men, who\r\nhad just been sent from Illyricum to Mesopotamia as a reinforcement, and\r\nwho were guarding the passes, becoming enervated and timid, and fearing\r\na surprise by night, withdrew from the public causeways in the evening,\r\na time above all others when they most required watching.\r\n\r\n3. And when it was remarked that they were all sunk in wine and sleep,\r\nabout twenty thousand Persians, under the command of Tamsapor and\r\nNohodares, passed without any one perceiving them, and fully armed as\r\nthey were, concealed themselves behind the high ground in the\r\nneighbourhood of Amida.\r\n\r\n4. Presently, when (as has been said) we started before daybreak on our\r\nmarch to Samosata, our advanced guard, on reaching a high spot which\r\ncommanded a more distant view, was suddenly alarmed by the glitter of\r\nshining arms; and cried out in a hurried manner that the enemy were at\r\nhand. Upon this the signal for battle was given, and we halted in a\r\nsolid column, never thinking of fleeing, since, indeed, those who would\r\nhave pursued us were in sight; nor to engage in battle with an enemy\r\nsuperior to us in numbers, and especially in cavalry; but seeing the\r\nnecessity for caution in the danger of certain death which lay before\r\nus.\r\n\r\n5. At last, when it seemed clear that a battle could not be avoided, and\r\nwhile we were still hesitating what to do, some of our men rashly\r\nadvanced as skirmishers, and were slain. And then, as each side pressed\r\nonwards, Antoninus, ambitiously marching in front of the enemy, was\r\nrecognized by Ursicinus, and addressed by him in a tone of reproach, and\r\ncalled a traitor and a scoundrel; till at last, taking off the tiara\r\nwhich he wore on his head as a badge of honour, he dismounted from his\r\nhorse, and bending down till his face nearly touched the ground, he\r\nsaluted the Roman general, calling him patron and master; and holding\r\nhis hands behind his back, which among the Assyrians is a gesture of\r\nsupplication, he said, \"Pardon me, most noble count, who have been\r\ndriven to this guilt by necessity, not by my own will. My creditors, as\r\nyou know, drove me headlong into it: men whose avarice even your high\r\nauthority, which tried to support me in my distress, could not\r\novercome.\" Having said this, he withdrew without turning his back upon\r\nhim, but retiring backwards in a respectful manner, with his face\r\ntowards him.\r\n\r\n6. And while this was taking place, which did not occupy above half an\r\nhour, our second rank, which occupied the higher ground, cried out that\r\nanother body of cuirassiers appeared behind, and was coming on with\r\ngreat speed.\r\n\r\n7. And then, as is often the case at critical moments, doubting which\r\nenemy we ought, or even could resist, and being pressed on all sides by\r\nan overwhelming mass, we dispersed in every direction, each fleeing\r\nwhere he could. And while every one was trying to extricate himself from\r\nthe danger, we were brought, without any order, face to face with the\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\n8. And so struggling vigorously while giving up all desire of saving our\r\nlives, we were driven back to the high banks of the Tigris. Some of our\r\nmen, driven into the water where it was shallow, locked their arms, and\r\nso made a stand; others were carried off by the current and drowned;\r\nsome, still fighting with the enemy, met with various fortune, or,\r\npanic-stricken at the numbers of the barbarians, sought the nearest\r\ndefiles of Mount Taurus. Among these was the general himself, who was\r\nrecognized and surrounded by a vast body of the enemy; but he escaped\r\nwith the tribune Aiadalthes and one groom, being saved by the swiftness\r\nof his horse.\r\n\r\n9. I myself was separated from my comrades, and while looking round to\r\nsee what to do, I met with one of the protectores named Verrinianus,\r\nwhose thigh was pierced through by an arrow, and while at his entreaty I\r\nwas trying to pull it out, I found myself surrounded on all sides by\r\nPersians, some of whom had passed beyond me. I therefore hastened back\r\nwith all speed towards the city, which, being placed on high ground, is\r\nonly accessible by one very narrow path on the side on which we were\r\nattacked; and that path is made narrower still by escarpments of the\r\nrocks, and barriers built on purpose to make the approach more\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\n10. Here we became mingled with the Persians, who were hastening with a\r\nrun, racing with us, to make themselves masters of the higher ground:\r\nand till the dawn of the next day we stood without moving, so closely\r\npacked, that the bodies of those who were slain were so propped up by\r\nthe mass that they could not find room to fall to the ground; and a\r\nsoldier in front of me, whose head was cloven asunder into equal\r\nportions by a mighty sword-blow, still stood upright like a log, being\r\npressed upon all sides.\r\n\r\n11. And although javelins were incessantly hurled from the battlements\r\nby every kind of engine, yet we were protected from that danger by the\r\nproximity of the walls. And at last I got in at the postern gate, which\r\nI found thronged by a multitude of both sexes flocking in from the\r\nneighbouring districts. For it happened by chance on these very days\r\nthat it was the time of a great annual fair which was held in the\r\nsuburbs, and which was visited by multitudes of the country people.\r\n\r\n12. In the mean time all was in disorder with every kind of noise; some\r\nbewailing those whom they had lost; others being mortally wounded; and\r\nmany calling on their different relations whom the crowd prevented them\r\nfrom discovering.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\n§ 1. This city had formerly been a very small one, till Constantius\r\nwhile Cæsar, at the same time that he built another town called\r\nAntinopolis, surrounded Amida also with strong towers and stout walls,\r\nthat the people in the neighbourhood might have a safe place of refuge.\r\nAnd he placed there a store of mural engines, making it formidable to\r\nthe enemy, as he wished it to be called by his own name.\r\n\r\n2. On the southern side it is watered by the Tigris, which passes close\r\nto it, making a kind of elbow: on the east it looks towards the plains\r\nof Mesopotamia, on the north it is close to the river Nymphæus, and is\r\novershadowed by the chain of Mount Taurus, which separates the nations\r\non the other side of the Tigris from Armenia. On the west it borders on\r\nthe province of Gumathena, a fertile and well-cultivated district, in\r\nwhich is a village known as Abarne, celebrated for the healing\r\nproperties of its hot springs. But in the very centre of Amida, under\r\nthe citadel, there rises a rich spring of water, drinkable indeed, but\r\noften tainted with hot vapours.\r\n\r\n3. In the garrison of this town, the fifth or Parthian legion was always\r\nlocated with a considerable squadron of native cavalry. But at that time\r\nsix legions, by forced marches, had outstripped the Persian host in its\r\nadvance, and greatly strengthened the garrison: they were the Magnentian\r\nand Decentian legions whom, after the end of the civil war, the emperor\r\nhad sent as mutinous and discontented to the East, since there the only\r\ndanger was from foreign wars: the tenth, and the thirteenth legion\r\ncalled the Fretensian:[99] and two legions of light infantry called\r\npræventores and superventores,[100] with Ælian, who was now a count. Of\r\nthese latter, when only new recruits, we have already[101] spoken, as\r\nsallying out from Singara at the instigation of this same Ælian, then\r\nonly one of the guard, and slaying a great number of Persians whom they\r\nhad surprised in their sleep.\r\n\r\n4. There was also the greater part of the force called companion\r\narchers, being squadrons of cavalry so named, in which all the free-born\r\nbarbarians serve, and who are conspicuous among all others for the\r\nsplendour of their arms and for their prowess.\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\n§ 1. While the first onset of the Persians was by its unexpected\r\nvehemence throwing these troops into disorder, the king, with his native\r\nand foreign troops, having after leaving Bebase turned his march to the\r\nright, according to the advice of Antoninus, passed by Horre and\r\nMeiacarire and Charcha, as if he meant also to pass by Amida. And when\r\nhe had come near the Roman forts, one of which is called Reman, and the\r\nother Busan, he learnt from some deserters that many persons had removed\r\ntheir treasures there for protection, trusting to their lofty and strong\r\nwalls; and it was also added that there was there, with a great many\r\nvaluables, a woman of exquisite beauty, the wife of a citizen of Nisibis\r\nnamed Craugasius, of great consideration by birth, character, and\r\ninfluence; with her little daughter.\r\n\r\n2. Sapor, eager to seize what belonged to another, hastened on, and\r\nattacked the castle with force; and the garrison, being seized with a\r\nsudden panic at the variety of arms of the assailants, surrendered\r\nthemselves, and all who had fled to them for protection; and at the\r\nfirst summons gave up the keys of the gates. Possession being taken, all\r\nthat was stored there was ransacked; women bewildered with fear were\r\ndragged forth; and children clinging to their mothers were taught bitter\r\nsuffering at the very beginning of their infancy.\r\n\r\n3. And when Sapor, by asking each whose wife she was, had found that of\r\nCraugasius trembling with fear of violence, he allowed her to come in\r\nsafety to him, and when he saw her, veiled as she was with a black veil\r\nto her lips, he kindly encouraged her with a promise that she should\r\nrecover her husband, and that her honour should be preserved inviolate.\r\nFor hearing that her husband was exceedingly devoted to her, he thought\r\nthat by this bribe he might win him over to betray Nisibis.\r\n\r\n4. And he also extended his protection to other virgins who, according\r\nto Christian rites, had been formally consecrated to the service of God,\r\nordering that they should be kept uninjured, and be allowed to perform\r\nthe offices of religion as they had been accustomed. Affecting clemency\r\nfor a time, in order that those who were alarmed at his former ferocity\r\nand cruelty might now discard their fears, and come to him of their own\r\naccord, learning from these recent examples that he tempered the\r\ngreatness of his success with humanity and courtesy.\r\n\r\n\r\n[89] It is not known what towns are meant by Castra Herculis and\r\nQuadriburgium.\r\n\r\n[90] Vespasian and Titus.\r\n\r\n[91] Ammianus was still in attendance on Ursicinus.\r\n\r\n[92] Homer, Od. xiii.

The corn was ripe when Sapor invaded Mesopotamia, 'cum\r\njura stipulâ flavente turgerent'--a circumstance which, in the latitude\r\nof Aleppo, would naturally refer us to the month of April or May. 2. The\r\nprogress of Sapor was checked by the overflowing of the Euphrates, which\r\ngenerally happens in July and August. 3. When Sapor had taken Amida,\r\nafter a siege of seventy-three days, the autumn was far advanced.\r\n'Autumno præcipiti hædorumque improbo sidere exorto.' To reconcile these\r\napparent contradictions, we must allow for some delay in the Persian\r\nking, some inaccuracy in the historian, and some disorder in the\r\nseasons.\"--Gibbon, cap. xix.; ed. Bohn, vol. ii. 320. \"Clinton, F.R., i.\r\n442, sees no such difficulty as Gibbon has here supposed; he makes Sapor\r\nto have passed the Tigris in May, reached the Euphrates July 8th,\r\narrived before Amida July 27th, and stormed the place October\r\n7th.\"--Editor of Bohn's ed.\r\n\r\n[98] That is, in the suburbs of Edessa, as cemeteries in ancient times\r\nwere usually outside the walls of cities.\r\n\r\n[99] It is not known what this name is derived from: some read\r\nFortensis, instead of Fretensis, and those who prefer this reading\r\nderive it either from Fortis, brave; or from Fortia, a small town of\r\nAsiatic Sarmatia.\r\n\r\n[100] Præventores, or \"going before;\" superventores, \"coming after,\" as\r\na reserve.\r\n\r\n[101] In one of the earlier books which has been lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK XIX.\r\n\r\nARGUMENT.\r\n\r\n     I. Sapor, while exhorting the citizens of Amida to surrender, is\r\n     assailed with arrows and javelins by the garrison--And when king\r\n     Grumbates makes a similar attempt, his son is slain.--II. Amida is\r\n     blockaded, and within two days is twice assaulted by the\r\n     Persians.--III. Ursicinus makes a vain proposal to sally out by\r\n     night, and surprise the besiegers, being resisted by Sabinianus,\r\n     the commander of the forces.--IV.

Towers and other engines are brought\r\n     close to the walls of the city, but they are burnt by the\r\n     Romans.--VIII. Attempts are made to raise lofty mounds close to the\r\n     walls of Amida, and by these means it is entered--After the fall of\r\n     the city, Marcellinus escapes by night, and flees to Antioch.--IX.\r\n     Of the Roman generals at Amida, some are put to death, and others\r\n     are kept as prisoners--Craugasius of Nisibis deserts to the\r\n     Persians from love of his wife, who is their prisoner.--X. The\r\n     people of Rome, fearing a scarcity, become seditious.--XI. The\r\n     Limigantes of Sarmatia, under pretence of suing for peace, attack\r\n     Constantius, who is deceived by their trick; but are driven back\r\n     with heavy loss.--XII. Many are prosecuted for treason, and\r\n     condemned.--XIII. Lauricius, of the Isaurians checks the hordes of\r\n     banditti.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n§ 1. The king, rejoicing at this our disaster and captivity, and\r\nexpecting other successes, advanced from this castle, and marching\r\nslowly, on the third day came to Amida.\r\n\r\n2. And at daybreak, everything, as far as we could see, glittered with\r\nshining arms; and an iron cavalry filled the plains and the hills.\r\n\r\n3. And he himself, mounted on his charger, and being taller than the\r\nrest, led his whole army, wearing instead of a crown a golden figure of\r\na ram's head inlaid with jewels; being also splendid from the retinue of\r\nmen of high rank and of different nations which followed him. And it was\r\nevident that his purpose was merely to try the garrison of the walls\r\nwith a parley, as, in following out the counsel of Antoninus, he was\r\nhastening to another quarter.\r\n\r\n4. But the deity of heaven, mercifully limiting the disasters of the\r\nempire within the compass of one region, led on this king to such an\r\nextravagant degree of elation, that he seemed to believe that the moment\r\nhe made his appearance the besieged would be suddenly panic-stricken,\r\nand have recourse to supplication and entreaty.\r\n\r\n5. He rode up to the gates, escorted by the cohort of his royal guard;\r\nand while pushing on more boldly, so that his very features might be\r\nplainly recognized, his ornaments made him such a mark for arrows and\r\nother missiles, that he would have been slain, if the dust had not\r\nhindered the sight of those who were shooting at him; so that after a\r\npart of his robe had been cut off by a blow of a javelin, he escaped to\r\ncause vast slaughter at a future time.\r\n\r\n6. After this, raging as if against sacrilegious men who had violated a\r\ntemple, he cried out that the lord of so many monarchs and nations had\r\nbeen insulted, and resolved to use all his efforts to destroy the city.\r\nBut at the entreaty of his choicest generals not to break the example of\r\nmercy which he had so gloriously set, by indulging in anger, he was\r\npacified, and the next day ordered the garrison to be summoned to\r\nsurrender.\r\n\r\n7. Therefore, at daybreak, Grumbates, king of the Chionitæ, went boldly\r\nup to the walls to effect that object, with a brave body of guards; and\r\nwhen a skilful reconnoitrer had noticed him coming within shot, he let\r\nfly his balista, and struck down his son in the flower of his youth, who\r\nwas at his father's side, piercing through his breastplate, breast and\r\nall; and he was a prince who in stature and beauty was superior to all\r\nhis comrades.\r\n\r\n8. At his death all his countrymen took to flight, but presently\r\nreturning in order to prevent his body from being carried off, and\r\nhaving roused with their dissonant clamours various tribes to their aid,\r\na stern conflict arose, the arrows flying on both sides like hail.\r\n\r\n9. The deadly struggle having been continued till the close of day, it\r\nwas nightfall before the corpse of the young prince, which had been so\r\nstubbornly defended, was extricated from the heap of dead and streams of\r\nblood, amid the thick darkness; as formerly at Troy, the armies fought\r\nin furious combat for the comrade of the Thessalian chieftain.[102]\r\n\r\n10. At his death the count was sad, and all the nobles as well as his\r\nfather were distressed at his sudden loss; and a cessation of arms\r\nhaving been ordered, the youth, so noble and beloved, was mourned after\r\nthe fashion of his nation. He was carried out in the arms he was wont to\r\nwear, and placed on a spacious and lofty pile; around him ten couches\r\nwere dressed, bearing effigies of dead men, so carefully laid out, that\r\nthey resembled corpses already buried; and for seven days all the men in\r\nthe companies and battalions celebrated a funeral feast, dancing, and\r\nsinging melancholy kinds of dirges in lamentation for the royal youth.\r\n\r\n11. And the women, with pitiable wailing, deplored with their customary\r\nweepings the hope of their nation thus cut off in the early bloom of\r\nyouth; as the worshippers of Venus are often seen to do in the solemn\r\nfestival of Adonis, which the mystical doctrines of religion show to be\r\nsome sort of image of the ripened fruits of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. When the body was burnt and the bones collected in a silver urn,\r\nwhich his father had ordered to be carried back to his native land, to\r\nbe there buried beneath the earth, Sapor, after taking counsel,\r\ndetermined to propitiate the shade of the deceased prince by making the\r\ndestroyed city of Amida his monument. Nor indeed was Grumbates willing\r\nto move onward while the shade of his only son remained unavenged.\r\n\r\n2. And having given two days to rest, and sent out large bodies of\r\ntroops to ravage the fertile and well-cultivated fields which were as\r\nheavy with crops as in the time of peace, the enemy surrounded the city\r\nwith a line of heavy-armed soldiers five deep; and at the beginning of\r\nthe third day the brilliant squadrons filled every spot as far as the\r\neye could see in every direction, and the ranks marching slowly, took up\r\nthe positions appointed to each by lot.\r\n\r\n3. All the Persians were employed in surrounding the walls; that part\r\nwhich looked eastward, where that youth so fatal to us was slain, fell\r\nto the Chionitæ. The Vertæ were appointed to the south; the Albani\r\nwatched the north; while opposite to the western gate were posted the\r\nSegestani, the fiercest warriors of all, with whom were trains of tall\r\nelephants, horrid with their wrinkled skins, which marched on slowly,\r\nloaded with armed men, terrible beyond the savageness of any other\r\nfrightful sight, as we have often said.\r\n\r\n4. When we saw these countless hosts thus deliberately collected for the\r\nconflagration of the Roman world, and directed to our own immediate\r\ndestruction, we despaired of safety, and sought only how to end our\r\nlives gloriously, as we all desired.\r\n\r\n5. From the rising of the sun to its setting, the enemy's lines stood\r\nimmovable, as if rooted to the ground, without changing a step or\r\nuttering a sound; nor was even the neigh of a horse heard; and the men\r\nhaving withdrawn in the same order as they had advanced, after\r\nrefreshing themselves with food and sleep, even before the dawn,\r\nreturned, led by the clang of brazen trumpets, to surround the city, as\r\nif fated to fall with their terrible ring.\r\n\r\n6. And scarcely had Grumbates, like a Roman fecial, hurled at us a spear\r\nstained with blood, according to his native fashion, than the whole\r\narmy, rattling their arms, mounted up to the walls, and instantly the\r\ntumult of war grew fierce, while all the squadrons hastened with speed\r\nand alacrity to the attack, and our men on their side opposed them with\r\nequal fierceness and resolution.\r\n\r\n7. Soon many of the enemy fell with their heads crushed by vast stones\r\nhurled from scorpions, some were pierced with arrows, others were\r\ntransfixed with javelins, and strewed the ground with their bodies;\r\nothers, wounded, fled back in haste to their comrades.\r\n\r\n8. Nor was there less grief or less slaughter in the city, where the\r\ncloud of arrows obscured the air, and the vast engines, of which the\r\nPersians had got possession when they took Singara, scattered wounds\r\neverywhere.\r\n\r\n9. For the garrison, collecting all their forces, returning in constant\r\nreliefs to the combat, in their eagerness to defend the city, fell\r\nwounded, to the hindrance of their comrades, or, being sadly torn as\r\nthey fell, threw down those who stood near them, or if still alive,\r\nsought the aid of those skilful in extracting darts which had become\r\nfixed in their bodies.\r\n\r\n10. So slaughter was met by slaughter, and lasted till the close of day,\r\nbeing scarcely stopped by the darkness of evening, so great was the\r\nobstinacy with which both sides fought.\r\n\r\n11. And the watches of the night were passed under arms, and the hills\r\nresounded with the shouts raised on both sides, while our men extolled\r\nthe valour of Constantius Cæsar as lord of the empire and of the world,\r\nand the Persians styled Sapor Saansas and Pyroses, which appellations\r\nmean king of kings, and conqueror in wars.\r\n\r\n12. The next morning, before daybreak, the trumpet gave the signal, and\r\ncountless numbers from all sides flocked like birds to a contest of\r\nsimilar violence; and in every direction, as far as the eye could reach,\r\nnothing could be seen in the plains and valleys but the glittering arms\r\nof these savage nations.\r\n\r\n13. And presently a shout was raised, and as the enemy rushed forward\r\nall at once, they were met by a dense shower of missiles from the walls;\r\nand as may be conjectured, none were hurled in vain, falling as they did\r\namong so dense a crowd. For while so many evils surrounded us, we fought\r\nas I have said before, with the hope, not of procuring safety, but of\r\ndying bravely; and from dawn to eventide the battle was evenly\r\nbalanced, both fighting with more ferocity than method, and there arose\r\nthe shouts of men striking and falling, so that from the eagerness of\r\nboth parties there was scarcely any one who did not give or receive\r\nwounds.\r\n\r\n14. At last, night put an end to the slaughter, and the losses on both\r\nsides caused a longer truce. For when the time intended for rest was\r\nallowed to us, continual sleepless toil still exhausted our little\r\nremaining strength, in spite of the dread caused by the bloodshed and\r\nthe pallid faces of the dying, whom the scantiness of our room did not\r\npermit us even the last solace of burying; since within the circuit of a\r\nmoderate city there were seven legions, and a vast promiscuous multitude\r\nof citizens and strangers of both sexes, and other soldiers, so that at\r\nleast twenty thousand men were shut up within the walls.\r\n\r\n15. So each attended to his own wounds as well as he could, availing\r\nhimself of whatever assistance or remedies came in his way. While some,\r\nbeing severely wounded, died of loss of blood; and some, pierced through\r\nby swords, lay on the ground, and breathed their last in the open air;\r\nothers who were pierced through and through the skilful refused to\r\ntouch, in order not to pain them further by inflicting useless\r\nsufferings; some, seeking the doubtful remedy of extracting the arrows,\r\nonly incurred agonies worse than death.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. While the war was going on in this manner around Amida, Ursicinus,\r\nvexed at being dependent on the will of another, gave continual warning\r\nto Sabinianus, who had superior authority over the soldiers, and who\r\nstill remained in the quarter of the tombs, to collect all his\r\nlight-armed troops, and hasten by secret paths along the foot of the\r\nmountain chain, with the idea that by the aid of this light force, if\r\nchance should aid them, they might surprise some of the enemy's\r\noutposts, and attack with success the night watches of the army, which,\r\nwith its vast circuit, was surrounding the walls, or else by incessant\r\nattacks might harass those who clung resolutely to the blockade.\r\n\r\n2. But Sabinianus rejected this proposal as mischievous, and produced\r\nsome letters from the emperor, expressly enjoining that all that could\r\nbe done was to be done without exposing the troops to any danger; but\r\nhis own secret motive he kept in his own bosom, namely, that he had been\r\nconstantly recommended while at court to refuse his predecessor, who was\r\nvery eager for glory, every opportunity of acquiring renown, however\r\nmuch it might be for the interest of the republic.\r\n\r\n3. Extreme pains were taken, even to the ruin of the provinces, to\r\nprevent the gallant Ursicinus from being spoken of as the author of or\r\npartner in any memorable exploit. Therefore, bewildered with these\r\nmisfortunes, Ursicinus, seeing that, though constantly sending spies to\r\nus (although from the strict watch that was set it was not easy for any\r\none to enter the city), and proposing many advantageous plans, he did no\r\ngood, seemed like a lion, terrible for his size and fierceness, but with\r\nhis claws cut and his teeth drawn, so that he could not dare to save\r\nfrom danger his cubs entangled in the nets of the hunters.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n§ 1. But in the city, where the number of the corpses which lay\r\nscattered over the streets was too great for any one to perform the\r\nfuneral rites over them, a pestilence was soon added to the other\r\ncalamities of the citizens; the carcases becoming full of worms and\r\ncorruption, from the evaporation caused by the heat, and the various\r\ndiseases of the people; and here I will briefly explain whence diseases\r\nof this kind arise.\r\n\r\n2. Both philosophers and skilful physicians agree that excess of cold,\r\nor of heat, or of moisture, or of drought, all cause pestilences; on\r\nwhich account those who dwell in marshy or wet districts are subject to\r\ncoughs and complaints in the eyes, and other similar maladies: on the\r\nother hand, those who dwell in hot climates are liable to fevers and\r\ninflammations. But since fire is the most powerful of all elements, so\r\ndrought is the quickest at killing.\r\n\r\n3. On this account it is that when the Greeks were toiling at the ten\r\nyears' war,[103] to prevent a foreigner from profiting by his violation\r\nof a royal marriage, a pestilence broke out among them, and numbers died\r\nby the darts of Apollo, who is the same as the Sun.\r\n\r\n4. Again, as Thucydides relates, that pestilence which at the beginning\r\nof the Peloponnesian war harassed the Athenians with a most cruel kind\r\nof sickness, came by slow steps from the burning plains of Ethiopia to\r\nAttica.\r\n\r\n5. Others maintain that the air and the water, becoming tainted by the\r\nsmell of corpses, and similar things, takes away the healthiness of a\r\nplace, or at all events that the sudden change of temperature brings\r\nforth slighter sicknesses.\r\n\r\n6. Some again affirm that the air becomes heavier by emanations from the\r\nearth, and kills some individuals by checking the perspiration of the\r\nbody, for which reason we learn from Homer, that, besides men, the other\r\nliving creatures also died; and we know by many instances, that in such\r\nplagues this does occur.\r\n\r\n7. Now the first species of pestilence is called pandemic; this causes\r\nthose who live in dry places to be attacked by frequent heats. The\r\nsecond is called epidemic, which gets gradually more violent, dims the\r\nsight of the eyes, and awakens dangerous humours. The third is called\r\nloemodes,[104] which is also temporary, but still often kills with\r\ngreat rapidity.\r\n\r\n8. We were attacked by this deadly pestilence from the excessive heat,\r\nwhich our numbers aggravated, though but few died: and at last, on the\r\nnight after the tenth day from the first attack, the heavy and dense air\r\nwas softened by a little rain, and the health of the garrison was\r\nrestored and preserved.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n§ 1. In the mean time the restless Persians were surrounding the city\r\nwith a fence of wicker-work, and mounds were commenced; lofty towers\r\nalso were constructed with iron fronts, in the top of each of which a\r\nbalista was placed, in order to drive down the garrison from the\r\nbattlements; but during the whole time the shower of missiles from the\r\narchers and slingers never ceased for a moment.\r\n\r\n2. We had with us two of the legions which had served under Magnentius,\r\nand which, as we have said, had lately been brought from Gaul, composed\r\nof brave and active men well adapted for conflicts in the plain; but not\r\nonly useless for such a kind of war as that by which we were now\r\npressed, but actually in the way. For as they had no skill either in\r\nworking the engines, or in constructing works, but were continually\r\nmaking foolish sallies, and fighting bravely, they always returned with\r\ndiminished numbers; doing just as much good, as the saying is, as a\r\nbucket of water brought by a single hand to a general conflagration.\r\n\r\n3. At last, when the gates were completely blocked, and they were\r\nutterly unable to get out, in spite of the entreaties of their tribunes,\r\nthey became furious as wild beasts. But on subsequent occasions their\r\nservices became conspicuous, as we shall show.\r\n\r\n4. In a remote part of the walls on the southern side, which looks down\r\non the Tigris, there was a high tower, below which yawned an abrupt\r\nprecipice, which it was impossible to look over without giddiness. From\r\nthis by a hollow subterranean passage along the foot of the mountain\r\nsome steps were cut with great skill, which led up to the level of the\r\ncity, by which water was secretly obtained from the river, as we have\r\nseen to be the case in all the fortresses in that district which are\r\nsituated on any river.\r\n\r\n5. This passage was dark, and because of the precipitous character of\r\nthe rock was neglected by the besiegers, till, under the guidance of a\r\ndeserter who went over to them, seventy Persian archers of the royal\r\nbattalion, men of eminent skill and courage, being protected by the\r\nremoteness of the spot which prevented their being heard, climbed up by\r\nthe steps one by one at midnight, and reached the third story of the\r\ntower. There they concealed themselves till daybreak, when they held out\r\na scarlet cloak as a signal for commencing an assault, when they saw\r\nthat the city was entirely surrounded by the multitude of their\r\ncomrades; and then they emptied their quivers and threw them down at\r\ntheir feet, and with loud cries shot their arrows among the citizens\r\nwith prodigious skill.\r\n\r\n6. And presently the whole of the mighty host of the enemy assaulted the\r\ncity with more ferocity than ever. And while we stood hesitating and\r\nperplexed to know which danger to oppose first, whether to make head\r\nagainst the foe above us, or against the multitude who were scaling the\r\nbattlements with ladders, our force was divided; and five of the lighter\r\nbalistæ were brought round and placed so as to attack our tower. They\r\nshot out heavy wooden javelins with great rapidity, sometimes\r\ntransfixing two of our men at one blow, so that many of them fell to the\r\nground severely wounded, and some jumped down in haste from fear of the\r\ncreaking engines, and being terribly lacerated by the fall, died.\r\n\r\n7. But by measures promptly taken, the walls were again secured on that\r\nside, and the engines replaced in their former situation.\r\n\r\n8. And since the crime of desertion had increased the labours of our\r\nsoldiers, they, full of indignation, moved along the battlements as if\r\non level ground, hurling missiles of all kinds, and exerting themselves\r\nso strenuously that the Virtæ, who were attacking on the south side,\r\nwere repulsed covered by wounds, and retired in consternation to their\r\ntents, having to lament the fall of many of their number.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n§ 1. Thus fortune showed us a ray of safety, granting us one day in\r\nwhich we suffered but little, while the enemy sustained a heavy loss;\r\nthe remainder of the day was given to rest in order to recruit our\r\nstrength; and at the dawn of the next morning we saw from the citadel an\r\ninnumerable multitude, which, after the capture of the fort called\r\nZiata, was being led to the enemy's camp. For a promiscuous multitude\r\nhad taken refuge in Ziata on account of its size and strength; it being\r\na place ten furlongs in circumference.\r\n\r\n2. In those days many other fortresses also were stormed and burnt, and\r\nmany thousands of men and women carried off from them into slavery;\r\namong whom were many men and women, enfeebled by age, who, fainting\r\nfrom different causes, broke down under the length of the journey, gave\r\nup all desire of life, and were hamstrung and left behind.\r\n\r\n3. The Gallic soldiers beholding these wretched crowds, demanded by a\r\nnatural but unseasonable impulse to be led against the forces of the\r\nenemy, threatening their tribunes and principal centurions with death if\r\nthey refused them leave.\r\n\r\n4. And as wild beasts kept in cages, being rendered more savage by the\r\nsmell of blood, dash themselves against their movable bars in the hope\r\nof escaping, so these men smote the gates, which we have already spoken\r\nof as being blockaded, with their swords; being very anxious not to be\r\ninvolved in the destruction of the city till they had done some gallant\r\nexploit; or, if they ultimately escaped from their dangers, not to be\r\nspoken of as having done nothing worth speaking of, or worthy of their\r\nGallic courage. Although when they had sallied out before, as they had\r\noften done, and had inflicted some loss on the raisers of the mounds,\r\nthey had always experienced equal loss themselves.\r\n\r\n5. We, at a loss what to do, and not knowing what resistance to oppose\r\nto these furious men, at length, having with some difficulty won their\r\nconsent thereto, decided, since the evil could be endured no longer, to\r\nallow them to attack the Persian advanced guard, which was not much\r\nbeyond bowshot; and then, if they could force their line, they might\r\npush their advance further. For it was plain that if they succeeded in\r\nthis, they would cause a great slaughter of the enemy.\r\n\r\n6. And while the preparations for this sally were being made, the walls\r\nwere still gallantly defended with unmitigated labour and watching, and\r\nplanting engines for shooting stones and darts in every direction. But\r\ntwo high mounds had been raised by the Persian infantry, and the\r\nblockade of the city was still pressed forward by gradual operations;\r\nagainst which our men, exerting themselves still more vigorously, raised\r\nalso immense structures, topping the highest works of the enemy; and\r\nsufficiently strong to support the immense weight of their defenders.\r\n\r\n7. In the mean time the Gallic troops, impatient of delay, armed with\r\ntheir axes and swords, went forth from the open postern gate, taking\r\nadvantage of a dark and moonless night. And imploring the Deity to be\r\npropitious, and repressing even their breath when they got near the\r\nenemy, they advanced with quick step and in close order, slew some of\r\nthe watch at the outposts, and the outer sentinels of the camp (who were\r\nasleep, fearing no such event), and entertained secret hopes of\r\npenetrating even to the king's tent if fortune assisted them.\r\n\r\n8. But some noise, though slight, was made by them in their march, and\r\nthe groans of the slain aroused many from sleep; and while each\r\nseparately raised the cry \"to arms,\" our soldiers halted and stood firm,\r\nnot venturing to move any further forward. For it would not have been\r\nprudent, now that those whom they sought to surprise were awakened, to\r\nhasten into open danger, while the bands of Persians were now heard to\r\nbe flocking to battle from all quarters.\r\n\r\n9. Nevertheless the Gallic troops, with undiminished strength and\r\nboldness, continued to hew down their foes with their swords, though\r\nsome of their own men were also slain, pierced by the arrows which were\r\nflying from all quarters; and they still stood firm, when they saw the\r\nwhole danger collected into one point, and the bands of the enemy coming\r\non with speed; yet no one turned his back: and they withdrew, retiring\r\nslowly as if in time to music, and gradually fell behind the pales of\r\nthe camp, being unable to sustain the weight of the battalions pressing\r\nclose upon them, and being deafened by the clang of the Persian\r\ntrumpets.\r\n\r\n10. And while many trumpets in turn poured out their clang from the\r\ncity, the gates were opened to receive our men, if they should be able\r\nto reach them: and the engines for missiles creaked, though no javelins\r\nwere shot from them, in order that the captains of the advanced guard of\r\nthe Persians, ignorant of the slaughter of their comrades, might be\r\nterrified by the noise into falling back, and so allowing our gallant\r\ntroops to be admitted in safety.\r\n\r\n11. And owing to this manoeuvre, the Gauls about daybreak entered the\r\ngate although with diminished numbers, many of them severely and others\r\nslightly wounded. They lost four hundred men this night, when if they\r\nhad not been hindered by more formidable obstacles, they would have\r\nslain in his very tent not Rhesus nor Thracians sleeping before the\r\nwalls of Troy, but the king of Persia, surrounded by one hundred\r\nthousand armed men.\r\n\r\n12. To their leaders, as champions of valiant actions, the emperor,\r\nafter the fall of the city, ordered statues in armour to be erected at\r\nEdessa in a frequented spot. And those statues are preserved up to the\r\npresent time unhurt.\r\n\r\n13. When the next day showed the slaughter which had been made, nobles\r\nand satraps were found lying amongst the corpses, and all kinds of\r\ndissonant cries and tears indicated the changed posture of the Persian\r\nhost: everywhere was heard wailing; and great indignation was expressed\r\nby the princes, who thought that the Romans had forced their way through\r\nthe sentries in front of the walls. A truce was made for three days by\r\nthe common consent of both armies, and we gladly accepted a little\r\nrespite in which to take breath.[105]\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. Now the nations of the barbarians, being amazed at the novelty of\r\nthis attempt, and rendered by it more savage than ever, discarding all\r\ndelay, determined to proceed with their works, since open assaults\r\navailed them but little. And with extreme warlike eagerness they all now\r\nhastened to die gloriously, or else to propitiate the souls of the dead\r\nby the ruin of the city.\r\n\r\n2. And now, the necessary preparations having been completed by the\r\nuniversal alacrity, at the rising of the day-star all kinds of\r\nstructures and iron towers were brought up to the walls; on the lofty\r\nsummits of which balistæ were fitted, which beat down the garrison who\r\nwere placed on lower ground.\r\n\r\n3. And when day broke the iron coverings of the bodies of the foe\r\ndarkened the whole heaven, and the dense lines advanced without any\r\nskirmishers in front, and not in an irregular manner as before, but to\r\nthe regular and soft music of trumpets; protected by the roofs of the\r\nengines, and holding before them wicker shields.\r\n\r\n4. And when they came within reach of our missiles, the Persian\r\ninfantry, holding their shields in front of them, and even then having\r\ndifficulty in avoiding the arrows which were shot from the engines on\r\nthe walls, for scarcely any kind of weapon found an empty space, they\r\nbroke their line a little; and even the cuirassiers were checked and\r\nbegan to retreat, which raised the spirits of our men.\r\n\r\n5. Still the balistæ of the enemy, placed on their iron towers, and\r\npouring down missiles with great power from their high ground on those\r\nin a lower position, spread a great deal of slaughter in our ranks. At\r\nlast, when evening came on, both sides retired to rest, and the greater\r\npart of the night was spent by us in considering what device could be\r\nadopted to resist the formidable engines of the enemy.\r\n\r\n6. At length, after we had considered many plans, we determined on one\r\nwhich the rapidity with which it could be executed made the safest--to\r\noppose four scorpions to the four balistæ; which were carefully moved (a\r\nvery difficult operation) from the place in which they were; but before\r\nthis work was finished, day arrived, bringing us a mournful sight,\r\ninasmuch as it showed us the formidable battalions of the Persians, with\r\ntheir trains of elephants, the noise and size of which animals are such\r\nthat nothing more terrible can be presented to the mind of man.\r\n\r\n7. And while we were pressed on all sides with the vast masses of arms,\r\nand works, and beasts, still our scorpions were kept at work with their\r\niron slings, hurling huge round stones from the battlements, by which\r\nthe towers of the enemy were crushed and the balistæ and those who\r\nworked them were dashed to the ground, so that many were desperately\r\ninjured, and many crushed by the weight of the falling structures. And\r\nthe elephants were driven back with violence, and surrounded by the\r\nflames which we poured forth against them, the moment that they were\r\nwounded retired, and could not be restrained by their riders. The works\r\nwere all burnt, but still there was no cessation from the conflict.\r\n\r\n8. For the king of the Persians himself, who is never expected to mingle\r\nin the fight, being indignant at these disasters, adopting a new and\r\nunprecedented mode of action, sprang forth like a common soldier among\r\nhis own dense columns; and as the very number of his guards made him the\r\nmore conspicuous to us who looked from afar on the scene, he was\r\nassailed by numerous missiles, and was forced to retire after he had\r\nlost many of his escort, while his troops fell back by echellons; and at\r\nthe end of the day, though frightened neither by the sad sight of the\r\nslaughter nor of the wounds, he at length allowed a short period to be\r\ngiven to rest.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. Night had put an end to the combat; and when a slight rest had been\r\nprocured from sleep, the moment that the dawn, looked for as the\r\nharbinger of better fortune, appeared, Sapor, full of rage and\r\nindignation, and perfectly reckless, called forth his people to attack\r\nus. And as his works were all burnt, as we have related, and the attack\r\nhad to be conducted by means of their lofty mounds raised close to our\r\nwalls, we also from mounds within the walls, as fast as we could raise\r\nthem, struggled in spite of all our difficulties, with all our might,\r\nand with equal courage, against our assailants.\r\n\r\n2. And long did the bloody conflict last, nor was any one of the\r\ngarrison driven by fear of death from his resolution to defend the city.\r\nThe conflict was prolonged, till at last, while the fortune of the two\r\nsides was still undecided, the structure raised by our men, having been\r\nlong assailed and shaken, at last fell, as if by an earthquake.\r\n\r\n3. And the whole space which was between the wall and the external mound\r\nbeing made level as if by a causeway or a bridge, opened a passage to\r\nthe enemy, which was no longer embarrassed by any obstacles; and numbers\r\nof our men, being crushed or enfeebled by their wounds, gave up the\r\nstruggle. Still men flocked from all quarters to repel so imminent a\r\ndanger, but from their eager haste they got in one another's way, while\r\nthe boldness of the enemy increased with their success.\r\n\r\n4. By the command of the king all his troops now hastened into action,\r\nand a hand-to-hand engagement ensued. Blood ran down from the vast\r\nslaughter on both sides: the ditches were filled with corpses, and thus\r\na wider path was opened for the besiegers. And the city, being now\r\nfilled with the eager crowd which forced its way in, all hope of defence\r\nor of escape was cut off, and armed and unarmed without any distinction\r\nof age or sex were slaughtered like sheep.\r\n\r\n5. It was full evening, when, though fortune had proved adverse, the\r\nbulk of our troops was still fighting in good order; and I, having\r\nconcealed myself with two companions in an obscure corner of the city,\r\nnow under cover of darkness, made my escape by a postern gate where\r\nthere was no guard; and aided by my own knowledge of the country and by\r\nthe speed of my companions, I at last reached the tenth milestone from\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\n6. Here, having lightly refreshed ourselves, I tried to proceed, but\r\nfound myself, as a noble unaccustomed to such toil, overcome by fatigue\r\nof the march. I happened to fall in, however, with what, though a most\r\nunsightly object, was to me, completely tired out, a most seasonable\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\n7. A groom riding a runaway horse, barebacked and without a bridle, in\r\norder to prevent his falling had knotted the halter by which he was\r\nguiding him tightly to his left hand, and presently, being thrown, and\r\nunable to break the knot, he was torn to pieces as he was dragged over\r\nthe rough ground and through the bushes, till at last the weight of his\r\ndead body stopped the tired beast; I caught him, and mounting him,\r\navailed myself of his services at a most seasonable moment, and after\r\nmuch suffering arrived with my companions at some sulphurous springs of\r\nnaturally hot water.\r\n\r\n8. On account of the heat we had suffered greatly from thirst, and had\r\nbeen crawling about for some time in search of water; and now when we\r\ncame to this well it was so deep that we could not descend into it, nor\r\nhad we any ropes; but, taught by extreme necessity, we tore up the linen\r\nclothes which we wore into long rags, which we made into one great rope,\r\nand fastened to the end of it a cap which one of us wore beneath his\r\nhelmet; and letting that down by the rope, and drawing up water in it\r\nlike a sponge, we easily quenched our thirst.\r\n\r\n9. From hence we proceeded rapidly to the Euphrates, intending to cross\r\nto the other side in the boat which long custom had stationed in that\r\nquarter, to convey men and cattle across.\r\n\r\n10. When lo! we see at a distance a Roman force with cavalry standards,\r\nscattered and pursued by a division of Persians, though we did not know\r\nfrom what quarter it had come so suddenly on them in their march.\r\n\r\n11. This example showed us that what men call indigenous people are not\r\nsprung from the bowels of the earth, but merely appear unexpectedly by\r\nreason of the speed of their movements: and because they were seen\r\nunexpectedly in various places, they got the name of Sparti,[106] and\r\nwere believed to have sprung from the ground, antiquity exaggerating\r\ntheir renown in a fabulous manner, as it does that of other things.\r\n\r\n12. Roused by this sight, since our only hope of safety lay in our\r\nspeed, we drew off through the thickets and woods to the high mountains;\r\nand from thence we went to Melitina, a town of the Lesser Armenia, where\r\nwe found our chief just on the point of setting off, in whose company we\r\nwent on to Antioch.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\n§ 1. In the mean time Sapor and the Persians began to think of returning\r\nhome, because they feared to penetrate more inland with their prisoners\r\nand booty, now that the autumn was nearly over, and the unhealthy star\r\nof the Kids had arisen.\r\n\r\n2. But amid the massacres and plunder of the destroyed city, Ælian the\r\ncount, and the tribunes by whose vigour the walls of Amida had been\r\ndefended, and the losses of the Persians multiplied, were wickedly\r\ncrucified; and Jacobus and Cæsias, the treasurers of the commander of\r\nthe cavalry, and others of the band of protectores, were led as\r\nprisoners, with their hands bound behind their backs; and the people of\r\nthe district beyond the Tigris, who were diligently sought for, were all\r\nslain without distinction of rank or dignity.\r\n\r\n3. But the wife of Craugasius, who, preserving her chastity inviolate,\r\nwas treated with the respect due to a high-born matron, was mourning as\r\nif she were to be carried to another world without her husband,\r\nalthough she had indications afforded her that she might hope for a\r\nhigher future.\r\n\r\n4. Therefore, thinking of her own interests, and having a wise forecast\r\nof the future, she was torn with a twofold anxiety, loathing both\r\nwidowhood and the marriage she saw before her. Accordingly, she secretly\r\nsent off a friend of sure fidelity, and well acquainted with\r\nMesopotamia, to pass by Mount Izala, between the two forts called Maride\r\nand Lorne, and so to effect his entrance into Nisibis, calling upon her\r\nhusband, with urgent entreaties and the revelation of many secrets of\r\nher own private condition, after hearing what the messenger could tell\r\nhim, to come to Persia and live happily with her there.\r\n\r\n5. The messenger, travelling with great speed through jungle roads and\r\nthickets, reached Nisibis, pretending that he had never seen his\r\nmistress, and that, as in all likelihood she was slain, he had availed\r\nhimself of an accidental opportunity to make his escape from the enemy's\r\ncamp. And so, being neglected as one of no importance, he got access to\r\nCraugasius, and told him what had happened. And having received from him\r\nan assurance that, as soon as he could do so with safety, he would\r\ngladly rejoin his wife, he departed, bearing the wished-for intelligence\r\nto the lady. She, when she received it, addressed herself, through the\r\nmedium of Tamsapor, to the king, entreating him that, if the opportunity\r\noffered before he quitted the Roman territories, he would order her\r\nhusband to be restored to her.\r\n\r\n6. But the fact of this stranger having departed thus unexpectedly,\r\nwithout any one suspecting it, after his secret return, raised\r\nsuspicions in the mind of Duke Cassianus and the other nobles who had\r\nauthority in the city, who addressed severe menaces to Craugasius,\r\ninsisting that the man could neither have come nor have gone without his\r\nprivity.\r\n\r\n7. And he, fearing the charge of treason, and being very anxious lest\r\nthe flight of the deserter should cause a suspicion that his wife was\r\nstill alive and was well treated by the enemy, feigned to court a\r\nmarriage with another virgin of high rank. And having gone out to a\r\nvilla which he had eight miles from the city, as if with the object of\r\nmaking the necessary preparations for the wedding feast, he mounted a\r\nhorse, and fled at full speed to a predatory troop of Persians which he\r\nhad learnt was in the neighbourhood, and being cordially received, when\r\nit was seen from what he said who he was, he was delivered over to\r\nTamsapor on the fifth day, and by him he was introduced to the king, and\r\nrecovered not only his wife, but his family and all his treasures,\r\nthough he lost his wife only a few months afterwards. And he was\r\nesteemed only second to Antoninus, though as a great poet has said,\r\n\r\n  \"Longo proximus intervallo.\"[107]\r\n\r\n8. For Antoninus was eminent both for genius and experience in affairs,\r\nand had useful counsels for every enterprise that could be proposed,\r\nwhile Craugasius was of a less subtle nature, though also very\r\ncelebrated. And all these events took place within a short time after\r\nthe fall of Amida.\r\n\r\n9. But the king, though showing no marks of anxiety on his countenance,\r\nand though he appeared full of exultation at the fall of the city, still\r\nin the depths of his heart was greatly perplexed, recollecting that in\r\nthe siege he had frequently sustained severe losses, and that he had\r\nlost more men, and those too of more importance than any prisoners whom\r\nhe had taken from us, or than we had lost in all the battles that had\r\ntaken place; as indeed had also been the case at Singara, and at\r\nNisibis. In the seventy-three days during which he had been blockading\r\nAmida, he had lost thirty thousand soldiers, as was reckoned a few days\r\nlater by Discenes, a tribune and secretary; the calculation being the\r\nmore easily made because the corpses of our men very soon shrink and\r\nlose their colour, so that their faces can never be recognized after\r\nfour days; but the bodies of the Persians dry up like the trunks of\r\ntrees, so that nothing exudes from them, nor do they suffer from any\r\nsuffusion of blood, which is caused by their more sparing diet, and by\r\nthe dryness and heat of their native land.\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\n§ 1. While these events and troubles were proceeding rapidly in the\r\nremote districts of the East, the Eternal City was fearing distress\r\nfrom an impending scarcity of corn; and the violence of the common\r\npeople, infuriated by the expectation of that worst of all evils, was\r\nvented upon Tertullus, who at that time was prefect of the city. This\r\nwas unreasonable, since it did not depend upon him that the provisions\r\nwere embarked in a stormy season in ships which, through the unusually\r\ntempestuous state of the sea, and the violence of contrary winds, were\r\ndriven into any ports they could make, and were unable to reach the port\r\nof Augustus, from the greatness of the dangers which threatened them.\r\n\r\n2. Nevertheless, Tertullus was continually troubled by the seditious\r\nmovements of the people, who worked themselves up to great rage, being\r\nexcited by the imminent danger of a famine; till, having no hope of\r\npreserving his own safety, he wisely brought his little boys out to the\r\npeople, who, though in a state of tumultuous disorder, were often\r\ninfluenced by sudden accidents, and with tears addressed them thus:--\r\n\r\n3. \"Behold your fellow-citizens, who (may the gods avert the omen),\r\nunless fortune should take a more favourable turn, will be exposed to\r\nthe same sufferings as yourselves. If then you think that by destroying\r\nthem you will be saved from all suffering, they are in your power.\" The\r\npeople, of their own nature inclined to mercy, were propitiated by this\r\nsad address, and made no answer, but awaited their impending fate with\r\nresignation.\r\n\r\n4. And soon, by the favour of the deity who has watched over the growth\r\nof Rome from its first origin, and who promised that it should last for\r\never, while Tertullus was at Ostia, sacrificing in the temple of Castor\r\nand Pollux, the sea became calm, the wind changed to a gentle south-east\r\nbreeze, and the ships in full sail entered the port, laden with corn to\r\nfill the granaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\n§ 1. While these perplexing transactions were taking place, intelligence\r\nfull of importance and danger reached Constantius who was reposing in\r\nwinter quarters at Sirmium, informing him (as he had already greatly\r\nfeared) that the Sarmatian Limigantes, who, as we have before related,\r\nhad expelled their masters from their hereditary homes, had learnt to\r\ndespise the lands which had been generously allotted to them in the\r\npreceding year, in order to prevent so fickle a class from undertaking\r\nany mischievous enterprise, and had seized on the districts over the\r\nborder; that they were straggling, according to their national custom,\r\nwith great licence over the whole country, and would throw everything\r\ninto disorder if they were not put down.\r\n\r\n2. The emperor, judging that any delay would increase their insolence,\r\ncollected from all quarters a strong force of veteran soldiers, and\r\nbefore the spring was much advanced, set forth on an expedition against\r\nthem, being urged to greater activity by two considerations; first,\r\nbecause the army, having acquired great booty during the last summer,\r\nwas likely to be encouraged to successful exertion in the hope of\r\nsimilar reward; and secondly, because, as Anatolius was at that time\r\nprefect of Illyricum, everything necessary for such an expedition could\r\nbe readily provided without recourse to any stringent measures.\r\n\r\n3. For under no other prefect's government (as is agreed by all), up to\r\nthe present time, had the northern provinces ever been so flourishing in\r\nevery point of view; all abuses being corrected with a kind and prudent\r\nhand, while the people were relieved from the burden of transporting the\r\npublic stores (which often caused such losses as to ruin many families),\r\nand also from the heavy income tax. So that the natives of those\r\ndistricts would have been free from all damage and cause of complaint,\r\nif at a later period some detestable collectors had not come among them,\r\nextorting money, and exaggerating accusations, in order to build up\r\nwealth and influence for themselves, and to procure their own safety and\r\nprosperity by draining the natives; carrying their severities to the\r\nproscription and even execution of many of them.\r\n\r\n4. To apply a remedy to this insurrection, the emperor set out, as I\r\nhave said, with a splendid staff, and reached Valeria, which was\r\nformerly a part of Pannonia, but which had been established as a\r\nseparate province, and received its new name in honour of Valeria, the\r\ndaughter of Diocletian. And having encamped his army on the banks of the\r\nDanube, he watched the movements of the barbarians, who, before his\r\narrival, had been proposing, under friendly pretences, to enter\r\nPannonia, meaning to lay it waste during the severity of the winter\r\nseason, before the snow had been melted by the warmth of spring and the\r\nriver had become passable, and while our people were unable from the\r\ncold to bear bivouacking in the open air.\r\n\r\n5. He at once therefore sent two tribunes, each accompanied by an\r\ninterpreter, to the Limigantes, to inquire mildly why they had quitted\r\nthe homes which at their own request had been assigned to them after the\r\nconclusion of the treaty of peace, and why they were now straggling in\r\nvarious directions, and passing their boundaries in contempt of his\r\nprohibitions.\r\n\r\n6. They made vain and frivolous excuses, fear compelling them to have\r\nrecourse to lies, and implored the emperor's pardon, beseeching him to\r\ndiscard his displeasure, and to allow them to cross the river and come\r\nto him to explain the hardships under which they were labouring;\r\nalleging their willingness, if required, to retire to remoter lands,\r\nonly within the Roman frontier, where, enjoying lasting peace and\r\nworshipping tranquillity as their tutelary deity, they would submit to\r\nthe name and discharge the duties of tributary subjects.\r\n\r\n7. When the tribunes returned and related this, the emperor, exulting\r\nthat an affair which appeared full of inextricable difficulties was\r\nlikely to be brought to a conclusion without any trouble, and being\r\neager to add to his acquisitions, admitted them all to his presence. His\r\neagerness for acquiring territory was fanned by a swarm of flatterers,\r\nwho were incessantly saying that when all distant districts were at\r\npeace, and when tranquillity was established everywhere, he would gain\r\nmany subjects, and would be able to enlist powerful bodies of recruits,\r\nthereby relieving the provinces, which would often rather give money\r\nthan personal service (though this expectation has more than once proved\r\nvery mischievous to the state).\r\n\r\n8. Presently he pitched his camp near Acimincum,[108] where a lofty\r\nmound was raised to serve for a tribune; and some boats, loaded with\r\nsoldiers of the legions, without their baggage, under command of\r\nInnocentius, an engineer who had suggested the measure, were sent to\r\nwatch the channel of the river, keeping close under the bank; so that,\r\nif they perceived the barbarians in disorder, they might come upon them\r\nand surprise their rear, while their attention was directed elsewhere.\r\n\r\n9. The Limigantes became aware of the measures thus promptly taken, but\r\nstill employed no other means of defence than humility and entreaty;\r\nthough secretly they cherished designs very different from those\r\nindicated by their words and gestures.\r\n\r\n10. But when they saw the emperor on his high mound preparing a mild\r\nharangue, and about to address them as men who would prove obedient in\r\nfuture, one of them, seized with a sudden fury, hurled his shoe at the\r\ntribune, and cried out, \"Marha, Marha!\" which in their language is a\r\nsignal of war; and a disorderly mob following him, suddenly raised their\r\nbarbaric standard, and with fierce howls rushed upon the emperor\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n11. And when he, looking down from his high position, saw the whole\r\nplace filled with thousands of men running to and fro, and their drawn\r\nswords and rapiers threatening him with immediate destruction, he\r\ndescended, and mingling both with the barbarians and his own men,\r\nwithout any one perceiving him or knowing whether he was an officer or a\r\ncommon soldier; and since there was no time for delay or inaction, he\r\nmounted a speedy horse, and galloped away, and so escaped.\r\n\r\n12. But his few guards, while endeavouring to keep back the mutineers,\r\nwho rushed on with the fierceness of fire, were all killed, either by\r\nwounds, or by being crushed beneath the weight of others who fell upon\r\nthem; and the royal throne, with its golden cushion, was torn to pieces\r\nwithout any one making an effort to save it.\r\n\r\n13. But presently, when it became known that the emperor, after having\r\nbeen in the most imminent danger of his life, was still in peril, the\r\narmy, feeling it to be the most important of all objects to assist him,\r\nfor they did not yet think him safe, and confiding in their prowess,\r\nthough from the suddenness of the attack they were only half formed,\r\nthrew themselves, with loud and warlike cries upon the bands of the\r\nbarbarians, fearlessly braving death.\r\n\r\n14. And because in their fiery valour our men were resolved to wipe out\r\ndisgrace by glory, and were full of anger at the treachery of the foe,\r\nthey slew every one whom they met without mercy, trampling all under\r\nfoot, living, wounded, and dead alike; so that heaps of dead were piled\r\nup before their hands were weary of the slaughter. For the rebels were\r\ncompletely overwhelmed, some being slain, and others fleeing in fear,\r\nmany of whom implored their lives with various entreaties, but were\r\nslaughtered with repeated wounds. And when, after they were all\r\ndestroyed, the trumpets sounded a retreat, it was found that only a very\r\nfew of our men were killed, and these had either been trampled down at\r\nfirst, or had perished from the insufficiency of their armour to resist\r\nthe violence of the enemy.\r\n\r\n15. But the most glorious death was that of Cella, the tribune of the\r\nScutarii, who at the beginning of the uproar set the example of plunging\r\nfirst into the middle of the Sarmatian host.\r\n\r\n16. After these blood-stained transactions, Constantius took what\r\nprecautions prudence suggested for the security of his frontiers, and\r\nthen returned to Sirmium, having avenged himself on the perfidity of his\r\nenemies. And having there settled everything which the occasion\r\nrequired, he quitted Sirmium and went to Constantinople, that by being\r\nnearer to the East, he might remedy the disasters which had been\r\nsustained at Amida, and having reinforced his army with new levies, he\r\nmight check the attempts of the king of Persia with equal vigour; as it\r\nwas clear that Sapor, if Providence and some more pressing occupation\r\ndid not prevent him, would leave Mesopotamia and bring the war over the\r\nplains on this side of that country.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. But amid these causes of anxiety, as if in accordance with\r\nold-established custom, instead of the signal for civil war, the trumpet\r\nsounded groundless charges of treason, and a secretary, whom we shall\r\noften have to speak of, named Paulus, was sent to inquire into these\r\ncharges. He was a man skilful in all the contrivances of cruelty, making\r\ngain and profit of tortures and executions, as a master of gladiators\r\ndoes of his fatal games.\r\n\r\n2. For as he was firm and resolute in his purpose of injuring people,\r\nhe did not abstain even from theft, and invented all kinds of causes for\r\nthe destruction of innocent men, while engaged in this miserable\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\n3. A slight and trivial circumstance afforded infinite material for\r\nextending his investigations. There is a town called Abydum in the most\r\nremote corner of the Egyptian Thebais, where an oracle of the god, known\r\nin that region by the name of Besa, had formerly enjoyed some celebrity\r\nfor its prophecies, and had sacred rites performed at it with all the\r\nceremonies anciently in use in the neighbouring districts.\r\n\r\n4. Some used to go themselves to consult this oracle, some to send by\r\nothers documents containing their wishes, and with prayers couched in\r\nexplicit language inquired the will of the deities; and the paper or\r\nparchment on which their wants were written, after the answer had been\r\ngiven, was sometimes left in the temple.\r\n\r\n5. Some of these were spitefully sent to the emperor, and he, narrow\r\nminded as he was, though often deaf to other matters of serious\r\nconsequence, had, as the proverb says, a soft place in his ear for this\r\nkind of information; and being of a suspicious and petty temper, became\r\nfull of gall and fury; and immediately ordered Paulus to repair with all\r\nspeed to the East, giving him authority, as to a chief of great eminence\r\nand experience, to try all the causes as he pleased.\r\n\r\n6. And Modestus also, at that time count of the East, a man well suited\r\nfor such a business, was joined with him in this commission. For\r\nHermogenes of Pontus, at that time prefect of the prætorium, was passed\r\nover as of too gentle a disposition.\r\n\r\n7. Paulus proceeded, as he was ordered, full of deadly eagerness and\r\nrage; inviting all kinds of calumnies, so that numbers from every part\r\nof the empire were brought before him, noble and low born alike; some of\r\nwhom were condemned to imprisonment, others to instant death.\r\n\r\n8. The city which was chosen to witness these fatal scenes was\r\nScythopolis in Palestine, which for two reasons seemed the most suitable\r\nof all places; first, because it was little frequented and secondly,\r\nbecause it was half-way between Antioch and Alexandria, from which city\r\nmany of those brought before this tribunal came.\r\n\r\n9. One of the first persons accused was Simplicius, the son of Philip;\r\na man who, after having been prefect and consul, was now impeached on\r\nthe ground that he was said to have consulted the oracle how to obtain\r\nthe empire. He was sentenced to the torture by the express command of\r\nthe emperor, who in these cases never erred on the side of mercy; but by\r\nsome special fate he was saved from it, and with uninjured body was\r\ncondemned to distant banishment.\r\n\r\n10. The next victim was Parnasius, who had been prefect of Egypt, a man\r\nof simple manners, but now in danger of being condemned to death, and\r\nglad to escape with exile; because long ago he had been heard to say\r\nthat when he left Patræ in Achaia, the place of his birth, with the view\r\nof procuring some high office, he had in a dream seen himself conducted\r\non his road by several figures in tragic robes.\r\n\r\n11. The next was Andronicus, subsequently celebrated for his liberal\r\naccomplishments and his poetry; he was brought before the court without\r\nhaving given any real ground for suspicion of any kind, and defended\r\nhimself so vigorously that he was acquitted.\r\n\r\n12. There was also Demetrius, surnamed Chytras, a philosopher, of great\r\nage, but still firm in mind and body; he, when charged with having\r\nfrequently offered sacrifices in the temple of his oracle, could not\r\ndeny it; but affirmed that, for the sake of propitiating the deity, he\r\nhad constantly done so from his early youth, and not with any idea of\r\naiming at any higher fortune by his questions; nor had he known any one\r\nwho had aimed at such. And though he was long on the rack he supported\r\nit with great constancy, never varying in his statement, till at length\r\nhe was acquitted and allowed to retire to Alexandria, where he was born.\r\n\r\n13. These and a few others, justice, coming to the aid of truth,\r\ndelivered from their imminent dangers. But as accusations extended more\r\nwidely, involving numbers without end in their snares, many perished;\r\nsome with their bodies mangled on the rack; others were condemned to\r\ndeath and confiscation of their goods; while Paulus kept on inventing\r\ngroundless accusations, as if he had a store of lies on which to draw,\r\nand suggesting various pretences for injuring people, so that on his\r\nnod, it may be said, the safety of every one in the place depended.\r\n\r\n14. For if any one wore on his neck a charm against the quartan ague or\r\nany other disease, or if by any information laid by his ill-wishers he\r\nwas accused of having passed by a sepulchre at nightfall, and therefore\r\nof being a sorcerer, and one who dealt in the horrors of tombs and the\r\nvain mockeries of the shades which haunt them, he was found guilty and\r\ncondemned to death.\r\n\r\n15. And the affairs went on as if people had been consulting Claros, or\r\nthe oaks at Dodona, or the Delphic oracles of old fame, with a view to\r\nthe destruction of the emperor.\r\n\r\n16. Meantime, the crowd of courtiers, inventing every kind of deceitful\r\nflattery, affirmed that he would be free from all common misfortunes,\r\nasserting that his fate had always shone forth with vigour and power in\r\ndestroying all who attempted anything injurious to him.\r\n\r\n17. That indeed strict investigation should be made into such matters,\r\nno one in his senses will deny; nor do we question that the safety of\r\nour lawful prince, the champion and defender of the good, and on whom\r\nthe safety of all other people depends, ought to be watched over by the\r\ncombined zeal of all men; and for the sake of insuring this more\r\ncompletely, when any treasonable enterprise is discovered, the Cornelian\r\nlaws have provided that no rank shall be exempted even from torture if\r\nnecessary for the investigation.\r\n\r\n18. But it is not decent to exult unrestrainedly in melancholy events,\r\nlest the subjects should seem to be governed by tyranny, not by\r\nauthority. It is better to imitate Cicero, who, when he had it in his\r\npower either to spare or to strike, preferred, as he tells us himself,\r\nto seek occasions for pardoning rather than for punishing, which is\r\ncharacteristic of a prudent and wise judge.\r\n\r\n19. At that time a monster, horrible both to see and to describe, was\r\nproduced at Daphne, a beautiful and celebrated suburb of Antioch;\r\nnamely, an infant with two mouths, two sets of teeth, two heads, four\r\neyes, and only two very short ears. And such a mis-shapen offspring was\r\nan omen that the republic would become deformed.\r\n\r\n20. Prodigies of this kind are often produced, presaging events of\r\nvarious kinds; but as they are not now publicly expiated, as they were\r\namong the ancients, they are unheard of and unknown to people in\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. During this period the Isaurians, who had been tranquil for some\r\ntime after the transactions already mentioned, and the attempt to take\r\nthe city of Seleucia, gradually reviving, as serpents come out of their\r\nholes in the warmth of spring, descended from their rocky and pathless\r\njungles, and forming into large troops, harassed their neighbours with\r\npredatory incursions; escaping, from their activity as mountaineers, all\r\nattempts of the soldiers to take them, and from long use moving easily\r\nover rocks and through thickets.\r\n\r\n2. So Lauricius was sent among them as governor, with the additional\r\ntitle of count, to reduce them to order by fair means or foul. He was a\r\nman of sound civil wisdom, correcting things in general by threats\r\nrather than by severity, so that while he governed the province, which\r\nhe did for some time, nothing happened deserving of particular notice.\r\n\r\n\r\n[102] Patroclus, the companion of Achilles.\r\n\r\n[103] The Trojan war.

Constantius\r\n     attacks Bezabde with his whole force, but fails--A discussion on\r\n     the rainbow.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nA.D. 360.\r\n\r\n§ 1. These were the events which took place in Illyricum and in the\r\nEast. But the next year, that of Constantius's tenth and Julian's third\r\nconsulship, the affairs of Britain became troubled, in consequence of\r\nthe incursions of the savage nations of Picts and Scots, who breaking\r\nthe peace to which they had agreed, were plundering the districts on\r\ntheir borders, and keeping in constant alarm the provinces exhausted by\r\nformer disasters, Cæsar, who was wintering at Paris, having his mind\r\ndivided by various cares, feared to go to the aid of his subjects across\r\nthe channel (as we have related Constans to have done), lest he should\r\nleave the Gauls without a governor, while the Allemanni were still full\r\nof fierce and warlike inclinations.\r\n\r\n2. Therefore, to tranquillize these districts by reason or by force, it\r\nwas decided to send Lupicinus, who was at that time commander of the\r\nforces; a man of talent in war, and especially skilful in all that\r\nrelated to camps, but very haughty, and smelling, as one may say, of the\r\ntragic buskin, while parts of his conduct made it a question which\r\npredominated--his avarice or his cruelty.\r\n\r\n3. Accordingly, an auxiliary force of light-armed troops, Heruli and\r\nBatavi, with two legions from Moesia, were in the very depth of winter\r\nput under the command of this general, with which he marched to\r\nBoulogne, and having procured some vessels and embarked his soldiers on\r\nthem, he sailed with a fair wind, and reached Richborough on the\r\nopposite coast, from which place he proceeded to London, that he might\r\nthere deliberate on the aspect of affairs, and take immediate measures\r\nfor his campaign.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. In the mean time, after the fall of Amida, and after Ursicinus had\r\nreturned as commander of the infantry to the emperor's camp (for we have\r\nalready mentioned that he had been appointed to succeed Barbatio), he\r\nwas at once attacked by slanderers, who at first tried to whisper his\r\ncharacter away, but presently openly brought forward false charges\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\n2. And the emperor, listening to them, since he commonly formed his\r\nopinions on vain conjecture, and was always ready to yield his judgment\r\nto crafty persons, appointed Arbetio and Florentius, the chief steward,\r\nas judges to inquire how it was that the town was destroyed. They\r\nrejected the plain and easily proved causes of the disaster, fearing\r\nthat Eusebius, at that time high chamberlain, would be offended if they\r\nadmitted proofs which showed undeniably that what had happened was owing\r\nto the obstinate inactivity of Sabinianus; and so distorting the truth,\r\nthey examined only some points of no consequence, and having no bearing\r\non the transaction.\r\n\r\n3. Ursicinus felt the iniquity of this proceeding; and said, \"Although\r\nthe emperor despises me, still the importance of this affair is such\r\nthat it cannot be judged of and punished by any decision lower than that\r\nof the emperor. Nevertheless, let him know what I venture to prophesy,\r\nthat while he is concerning himself about this disaster at Amida, of\r\nwhich he has received a faithful account; and while he gives himself up\r\nto the influence of the eunuchs, he will not in the ensuing spring,[109]\r\neven if he himself should come with the entire strength of his army, be\r\nable to prevent the dismemberment of Mesopotamia.\" This speech having\r\nbeen related to the emperor with many additions, and a malignant\r\ninterpretation, Constantius became enraged beyond measure; and without\r\nallowing the affair to be discussed, or those things to be explained to\r\nhim of which he was ignorant, he believed all the calumnies against\r\nUrsicinus, and deposing him from his office, ordered him into\r\nretirement; promoting Agilo, by a vast leap, to take his place, he\r\nhaving been before only a tribune of a native troop of Scutarii.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. At the same time one day the sky in the east was perceived to be\r\ncovered with a thick darkness, and from daybreak to noon the stars were\r\nvisible throughout; and, as an addition to these terrors, while the\r\nlight of heaven was thus withdrawn, and the world almost buried in\r\nclouds, men, from the length of the eclipse, began to believe that the\r\nsun had wholly disappeared. Presently, however, it was seen again like a\r\nnew moon, then like a half-moon, and at last it was restored entire.\r\n\r\n2. A thing which on other occasions did not happen so visibly except\r\nwhen after several unequal revolutions, the moon returns to exactly the\r\nsame point at fixed intervals; that is to say, when the moon is found in\r\nthe same sign of the zodiac, exactly opposite to the rays of the sun,\r\nand stops there a few minutes, which in geometry are called parts of\r\nparts.\r\n\r\n3. And although the changes and motions of both sun and moon, as the\r\ninquiries into intelligible causes have remarked, perpetually return to\r\nthe same conjunction at the end of each lunar month, still the sun is\r\nnot always eclipsed on these occasions, but only when the moon, as by a\r\nkind of balance, is in the exact centre between the sun and our sight.\r\n\r\n4. In short, the sun is eclipsed, and his brilliancy removed from our\r\nsight, when he and the moon, which of all the constellations of heaven\r\nis the lowest, proceeding with equal pace in their orbits, are placed in\r\nconjunction in spite of the height which separates them (as Ptolemy\r\nlearnedly explains it), and afterwards return to the dimensions which\r\nare called ascending or descending points of the ecliptic conjunctions:\r\nor, as the Greeks call them, defective conjunctions. And if these great\r\nlights find themselves in the neighbourhood of these points or knots,\r\nthe eclipse is small.\r\n\r\n5. But if they are exactly in the knots which form the points of\r\nintersection between the ascending and descending path of the moon, then\r\nthe sky will be covered with denser darkness, and the whole atmosphere\r\nbecomes so thick that we cannot see what is close to us.\r\n\r\n6. Again, the sun is conceived to appear double when a cloud is raised\r\nhigher than usual, which from its proximity to the eternal fires, shines\r\nin such a manner that it forms the brightness of a second orb as from a\r\npurer mirror.\r\n\r\n7. Now let us come to the moon. The moon sustains a clear and visible\r\neclipse when, being at the full, and exactly opposite to the sun, she is\r\ndistant from his orb one hundred and eighty degrees, that is, is in the\r\nseventh sign; and although this happens at every full moon, still there\r\nis not always one eclipse.\r\n\r\n8. But since she is always nearest to the earth as it revolves, and the\r\nmost distant from the rest of the other stars, and sometimes exposes\r\nitself to the light which strikes it, and sometimes also is partially\r\nobscured by the intervention of the shade of night, which comes over it\r\nin the form of a cone; and then she is involved in thick darkness, when\r\nthe sun, being surrounded by the centre of the lowest sphere, cannot\r\nilluminate her with his rays, because the mass of the earth is in the\r\nway; for opinions agree that the moon has no light of her own.\r\n\r\n9. And when she returns to the same sign of the zodiac which the sun\r\noccupies, she is obscured (as has been said), her brightness being\r\nwholly dimmed, and this is called a conjunction of the moon.\r\n\r\n10. Again the moon is said to be new when she has the sun above her with\r\na slight variation from the perpendicular, and then she appears very\r\nthin to mankind, even when leaving the sun she reaches the second sign.\r\nThen, when she has advanced further, and shines brilliantly with a sort\r\nof horned figure, she is said to be crescent shaped; but when she begins\r\nto be a long way distant from the sun, and reaches the fourth sign, she\r\ngets a greater light, the sun's rays being turned upon her, and then she\r\nis of the shape of a semicircle.\r\n\r\n11. As she goes on still further, and reaches the fifth sign, she\r\nassumes a convex shape, a sort of hump appearing from each side. And\r\nwhen she is exactly opposite the sun, she shines with a full light,\r\nhaving arrived at the seventh sign; and even while she is there, having\r\nadvanced but a very little further, she begins to diminish, which we\r\ncall waning; and as she gets older, she resumes the same shapes that she\r\nhad while increasing. But it is established by unanimous consent that\r\nshe is never seen to be eclipsed except in the middle of her course.\r\n\r\n12. But when we said that the sun moves sometimes in the ether,\r\nsometimes in the lower-world, it must be understood that the starry\r\nbodies, considered in relation to the universe, neither set nor rise;\r\nbut only appear to do so to our sight on earth, which is suspended by\r\nthe motion of some interior spirit, and compared with the immensity of\r\nthings is but a little point, which causes the stars in their eternal\r\norder to appear sometimes fixed in heaven, and at others, from the\r\nimperfection of human vision, moving from their places. Let us now\r\nreturn to our original subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n§ 1. Even while he was hastening to lead succours to the East, which, as\r\nthe concurrent testimony of both spies and deserters assured him, was on\r\nthe point of being invaded by the Persians, Constantius was greatly\r\ndisturbed by the virtues of Julian, which were now becoming renowned\r\namong all nations, so highly did fame extol his great labours,\r\nachievements, and victories, in having conquered several kingdoms of the\r\nAllemanni, and recovered several towns in Gaul which had been plundered\r\nand destroyed by the barbarians, and having compelled the barbarians\r\nthemselves to become subjects and tributaries of the empire.\r\n\r\n2. Influenced by these considerations, and fearing lest Julian's\r\ninfluence should become greater, at the instigation, as it is said, of\r\nthe prefect Florentius, he sent Decentius, the tribune and secretary, to\r\nbring away at once the auxiliary troops of the Heruli and Batavi, and\r\nthe Celtæ, and the legion called Petulantes,[110] and three hundred\r\npicked men from the other forces; enjoining him to make all speed on the\r\nplea that their presence was required with the army which it was\r\nintended to march at the beginning of spring against the Parthians.\r\n\r\n3. Also, Lupicinus was directed to come as commander of these auxiliary\r\ntroops with the three hundred picked men and to lose no time, as it was\r\nnot known that he had crossed over to Britain; and Sintula, at that time\r\nthe superintendent of Julian's stables, was ordered to select the best\r\nmen of the Scutarii and Gentiles,[111] and to bring them also to join\r\nthe emperor.\r\n\r\n4. Julian made no remonstrance, but obeyed these orders, yielding in all\r\nrespects to the will of the emperor. But on one point he could not\r\nconceal his feelings nor keep silence: but entreated that those men\r\nmight be spared from this hardship who had left their homes on the other\r\nside of the Rhine, and had joined his army on condition of never being\r\nmoved into any country beyond the Alps, urging that if this were known,\r\nit might be feared that other volunteers of the barbarian nations, who\r\nhad often enlisted in our service on similar conditions, would be\r\nprevented from doing so in future. But he argued in vain.\r\n\r\n5. For the tribune, disregarding his complaints, carried out the\r\ncommands of the emperor, and having chosen out a band suited for forced\r\nmarches, of pre-eminent vigour and activity, set out with them full of\r\nhope of promotion.\r\n\r\n6. And as Julian, being in doubt what to do about the rest of the troops\r\nwhom he was ordered to send, and revolving all kinds of plans in his\r\nmind, considered that the matter ought to be managed with great care, as\r\nthere was on one side the fierceness of the barbarians, and on the other\r\nthe authority of the orders he had received (his perplexity being\r\nfurther increased by the absence of the commander of the cavalry), he\r\nurged the prefect, who had gone some time before to Vienne under the\r\npretence of procuring corn, but in reality to escape from military\r\ntroubles, to return to him.\r\n\r\n7. For the prefect bore in mind the substance of a report which he was\r\nsuspected to have sent some time before, and which recommended the\r\nwithdrawing from the defence of Gaul those troops so renowned for their\r\nvalour, and already objects of dread to the barbarians.\r\n\r\n8. The prefect, as soon as he had received Julian's letters, informing\r\nhim of what had happened, and entreating him to come speedily to him to\r\naid the republic with his counsels, positively refused, being alarmed\r\nbecause the letters expressly declared that in any crisis of danger the\r\nprefect ought never to be absent from the general. And it was added that\r\nif he declined to give his aid, Julian himself would, of his own accord,\r\nrenounce the emblems of authority, thinking it better to die, if so it\r\nwas fated, than to have the ruin of the provinces attributed to him. But\r\nthe obstinacy of the prefect prevailed, and he resolutely refused to\r\ncomply with the wishes thus reasonably expressed and enforced.\r\n\r\n9. But during the delay which arose from the absence of Lupicinus and of\r\nany military movement on the part of the alarmed prefect, Julian,\r\ndeprived of all assistance in the way of advice, and being greatly\r\nperplexed, thought it best to hasten the departure of all his troops\r\nfrom the stations in which they were passing the winter, and to let them\r\nbegin their march.\r\n\r\n10. When this was known, some one privily threw down a bitter libel near\r\nthe standard of the Petulantes legion, which, among other things,\r\ncontained these words,--\"We are being driven to the farthest parts of\r\nthe earth like condemned criminals, and our relations will become slaves\r\nto the Allemanni after we have delivered them from that first captivity\r\nby desperate battles.\"\r\n\r\n11. When this writing was taken to head-quarters and read, Julian,\r\nconsidering the reasonableness of the complaint, ordered that their\r\nfamilies should go to the East with them, and allowed them the use of\r\nthe public wagons for the purpose of moving them. And as it was for some\r\ntime doubted which road they should take, he decided, at the suggestion\r\nof the secretary Decentius, that they should go by Paris, where he\r\nhimself still was, not having moved.\r\n\r\n12. And so it was done. And when they arrived in the suburbs, the\r\nprince, according to his custom, met them, praising those whom he\r\nrecognized, and reminding individuals of their gallant deeds, he\r\ncongratulated them with courteous words, encouraging them to go\r\ncheerfully to join the emperor, as they would reap the most worthy\r\nrewards of their exertions where power was the greatest and most\r\nextensive.\r\n\r\n13. And to do them the more honour, as they were going to a great\r\ndistance, he invited their chiefs to a supper, when he bade them ask\r\nwhatever they desired. And they, having been treated with such\r\nliberality, departed, anxious and sorrowful on two accounts, because\r\ncruel fortune was separating them at once from so kind a ruler and from\r\ntheir native land. And with this sorrowful feeling they retired to their\r\ncamp.\r\n\r\n14. But when night came on they broke out into open discontent, and\r\ntheir minds being excited, as his own griefs pressed upon each\r\nindividual, they had recourse to force, and took up arms, and with a\r\ngreat outcry thronged to the palace, and surrounding it so as to prevent\r\nany one from escaping, they saluted Julian as emperor with loud\r\nvociferations, insisting vehemently on his coming forth to them; and\r\nthough they were compelled to wait till daylight, still, as they would\r\nnot depart, at last he did come forth. And when he appeared, they\r\nsaluted him emperor with redoubled and unanimous cheers.\r\n\r\n15. But he steadily resisted them individually and collectively, at one\r\ntime showing himself indignant, at another holding out his hands and\r\nentreating and beseeching them not to sully their numerous victories\r\nwith anything unbecoming, and not to let unseasonable rashness and\r\nprecipitation awaken materials for discord. At last he appeased them,\r\nand having addressed them mildly, he added--\r\n\r\n16. \"I beseech you let your anger depart for a while: without any\r\ndissension or attempt at revolution what you wish will easily be\r\nobtained. Since you are so strongly bound by love of your country, and\r\nfear strange lands to which you are unaccustomed, return now to your\r\nhomes, certain that you shall not cross the Alps, since you dislike it.\r\nAnd I will explain the matter to the full satisfaction of the emperor,\r\nwho is a man of great wisdom, and will listen to reason.\"\r\n\r\n17. Nevertheless, after his speech was ended, the cries were repeated\r\nwith as much vigour and unanimity as ever; and so vehement was the\r\nuproar and zeal, which did not even spare reproaches and threats, that\r\nJulian was compelled to consent. And being lifted up on the shield of\r\nan infantry soldier, and raised up in sight of all, he was saluted as\r\nAugustus with one universal acclamation, and was ordered to produce a\r\ndiadem. And when he said that he had never had one, his wife's coronet\r\nor necklace was demanded.\r\n\r\n18. And when he protested that it was not fitting for him at his first\r\naccession to be adorned with female ornaments, the frontlet of a horse\r\nwas sought for, so that being crowned therewith, he might have some\r\nbadge, however obscure, of supreme power. But when he insisted that that\r\nalso would be unbecoming, a man named Maurus, afterwards a count, the\r\nsame who was defeated in the defile of the Succi, but who was then only\r\none of the front-rank men of the Petulantes, tore a chain off his own\r\nneck, which he wore in his quality of standard-bearer, and placed it\r\nboldly on Julian's head, who, being thus brought under extreme\r\ncompulsion, and seeing that he could not escape the most imminent danger\r\nto his life if he persisted in his resistance, consented to their\r\nwishes, and promised a largesse of five pieces of gold and a pound of\r\nsilver to every man.\r\n\r\n19. After this Julian felt more anxiety than ever; and, keenly alive to\r\nthe future consequences, neither wore his diadem or appeared in public,\r\nnor would he even transact the serious business which pressed upon his\r\nattention, but sought retirement, being full of consternation at the\r\nstrangeness of the recent events. This continued till one of the\r\ndecurions of the palace (which is an office of dignity) came in great\r\nhaste to the standards of the Petulantes and of the Celtic legion, and\r\nin a violent manner exclaimed that it was a monstrous thing that he who\r\nhad the day before been by their will declared emperor should have been\r\nprivily assassinated.\r\n\r\n20. When this was heard, the soldiers, as readily excited by what they\r\ndid not know as by what they did, began to brandish their javelins, and\r\ndraw their swords, and (as is usual at times of sudden tumult) to flock\r\nfrom every quarter in haste and disorder to the palace. The sentinels\r\nwere alarmed at the uproar, as were the tribunes and the captain of the\r\nguard, and suspecting some treachery from the fickle soldiery, they\r\nfled, fearing sudden death to themselves.\r\n\r\n21. When all before them seemed tranquil, the soldiers stood quietly\r\nawhile; and on being asked what was the cause of their sudden and\r\nprecipitate movement, they at first hesitated, and then avowing their\r\nalarm for the safety of the emperor, declared they would not retire till\r\nthey had been admitted into the council-chamber, and had seen him safe\r\nin his imperial robes.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n§ 1. When the news of these events reached the troops, whom we have\r\nspoken of as having already marched under the command of Sintula, they\r\nreturned with him quietly to Paris. And an order having been issued that\r\nthe next morning they should all assemble in the open space in front of\r\nthe camp, Julian advanced among them, and ascended a tribunal more\r\nsplendid than usual, surrounded with the eagles, standards, and banners,\r\nand guarded by a strong band of armed soldiers.\r\n\r\n2. And after a moment's quiet, while he looked down from his height on\r\nthe countenances of those before him, and saw them all full of joy and\r\nalacrity, he kindled their loyalty with a few simple words, as with a\r\ntrumpet.\r\n\r\n3. \"The difficulty of my situation, O brave and faithful champions of\r\nmyself and of the republic, who have often with me exposed your lives\r\nfor the welfare of the provinces, requires that, since you have now by\r\nyour resolute decision raised me, your Cæsar, to the highest of all\r\ndignities, I should briefly set before you the state of affairs, in\r\norder that safe and prudent remedies for their new condition may be\r\ndevised.\r\n\r\n4. \"While little more than a youth, as you well know, I was for form's\r\nsake invested with the purple, and by the decision of the emperor was\r\nintrusted to your protection. Since that time I have never forgotten my\r\nresolution of a virtuous life: I have been seen with you as the partner\r\nof all your labours, when, in consequence of the diminution of the\r\nconfidence felt in us by the barbarians, terrible disasters fell upon\r\nthe empire, our cities being stormed, and countless thousands of men\r\nbeing slain, and even the little that was left to us being in a very\r\ntottering condition. I think it superfluous to recapitulate how often,\r\nin the depth of winter, beneath a frozen sky, at a season when there is\r\nusually a cessation from war both by land and sea, we have defeated with\r\nheavy loss the Allemanni, previously unconquered.\r\n\r\n5. \"One circumstance may neither be passed over nor suppressed. On that\r\nglorious day which we saw at Strasburg, which brought perpetual liberty\r\nto Gaul, we together, I throwing myself among the thickly falling darts,\r\nand you being invincible by your vigour and experience, repelled the\r\nenemy who poured upon us like a torrent; slaying them as we did with the\r\nsword, or driving them to be drowned in the river, with very little loss\r\nof our own men, whose funerals we celebrated with glorious panegyrics\r\nrather than with mourning.\r\n\r\n6. \"It is my belief that after such mighty achievements posterity will\r\nnot be silent respecting your services to the republic, in every\r\ncountry, if you now, in case of any danger or misfortune, vigorously\r\nsupport with your valour and resolution me whom you have raised to the\r\nlofty dignity of emperor.\r\n\r\n7. \"But to maintain things in their due order, so as to preserve to\r\nbrave men their well-merited rewards and prevent underhand ambition from\r\nforestalling your honours, I make this rule in the honourable presence\r\nof your counsel. That no civil or military officer shall be promoted\r\nfrom any other consideration than that of his own merits; and he shall\r\nbe disgraced who solicits promotion for any one on any other ground.\"\r\n\r\n8. The lower class of soldiers, who had long been deprived of rank or\r\nreward, were encouraged by this speech to entertain better hopes, and\r\nnow rising up with a great noise, and beating their shields with their\r\nspears, they with unanimous shouts showed their approbation of his\r\nlanguage and purpose.\r\n\r\n9. And that no opportunity, however brief, might be afforded to disturb\r\nso wise an arrangement, the Petulantes and Celtic legion immediately\r\nbesought him, on behalf of their commissaries, to give them the\r\ngovernment of any provinces he pleased, and when he refused them, they\r\nretired without being either offended or out of humour.\r\n\r\n10. But the very night before the day on which he was thus proclaimed\r\nemperor, Julian had mentioned to his most intimate friends that during\r\nhis slumbers some one had appeared to him in a dream, in the form and\r\nhabit of the genius of the empire, who uttered these words in a tone of\r\nreproach: \"For some time, Julian, have I been secretly watching the door\r\nof thy palace, wishing to increase thy dignity, and I have often retired\r\nas one rejected; but if I am not now admitted, when the opinion of the\r\nmany is unanimous, I shall retire discouraged and sorrowful. But lay\r\nthis up in the depth of thy heart, that I will dwell with thee no\r\nlonger.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n§ 1. While these transactions were proceeding in Gaul, to the great\r\nanxiety of many, the fierce king of Persia (the advice of Antoninus\r\nbeing now seconded by the arrival of Craugasius), burning with eagerness\r\nto obtain Mesopotamia, while Constantius with his army was at a\r\ndistance, crossed the Tigris in due form with a vast army, and laid\r\nsiege to Singara with a thoroughly equipped force, sufficient for the\r\nsiege of a town which, in the opinion of the chief commanders of those\r\nregions, was abundantly fortified and supplied.\r\n\r\n2. The garrison, as soon as they saw the enemy, while still at a\r\ndistance, at once closed their gates, and with great spirit thronged to\r\nthe towers and battlements, collecting on them stones and warlike\r\nengines. And then, having made all their preparations, they stood\r\nprepared to repel the advancing host if they should venture to approach\r\nthe walls.\r\n\r\n3. Therefore the king, when he arrived and found that, though they would\r\nadmit some of his nobles near enough to confer with them, he could not,\r\nby any conciliatory language, bend the garrison to his wishes, he gave\r\none entire day to rest, and then, at daybreak, on a signal made by the\r\nraising of a scarlet flag, the whole city was surrounded by men carrying\r\nladders, while others began to raise engines; all being protected by\r\nfences and penthouses while seeking a way to assail the foundation of\r\nthe walls.\r\n\r\n4. Against these attempts the citizens, standing on the lofty\r\nbattlements, drove back with stones and every kind of missile the\r\nassailants who were seeking with great ferocity to find an entrance.\r\n\r\n5. For many days the struggle continued without any decided result, many\r\nbeing wounded and killed on both sides. At last, the struggle growing\r\nfiercer, one day on the approach of evening a very heavy battering-ram\r\nwas brought forward among other engines, which battered a round tower\r\nwith repeated blows, at a point where we mentioned that the city had\r\nbeen laid open in a former siege.\r\n\r\n6. The citizens at once repaired to this point, and a violent conflict\r\narose in this small space; torches and firebrands were brought from all\r\nquarters to consume this formidable engine, while arrows and bullets\r\nwere showered down without cessation on the assailants. But the keenness\r\nof the ram prevailed over every means of defence, digging through the\r\nmortar of the recently cemented stones, which was still moist and\r\nunsettled.\r\n\r\n7. And while the contest was thus proceeding with fire and sword, the\r\ntower fell, and a path was opened into the city, the place being\r\nstripped of its defenders, whom the magnitude of the danger had\r\nscattered. The Persian bands raised a wild shout, and without hindrance\r\nfilled every quarter of the city. A very few of the inhabitants were\r\nslain, and all the rest, by command of Sapor, were taken alive and\r\ntransported to the most distant regions of Persia.\r\n\r\n8. There had been assigned for the protection of this city two legions,\r\nthe first Flavian and the first Parthian, and a great body of native\r\ntroops, as well as a division of auxiliary cavalry which had been shut\r\nup in it through the suddenness of the attack made upon it. All of\r\nthese, as I have said, were taken prisoners, without receiving any\r\nassistance from our armies.\r\n\r\n9. For the greater part of our army was in tents taking care of Nisibis,\r\nwhich was at a considerable distance. But even if it had not been so, no\r\none even in ancient times could easily bring aid to Singara when in\r\ndanger, since the whole country around laboured under a scarcity of\r\nwater. And although a former generation had placed this fort very\r\nadvisedly, to check sudden movements of hostility, yet it was a great\r\nburden to the state, having been several times taken, and always\r\ninvolving the loss of its garrison.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. After Singara had fallen, Sapor prudently avoided Nisibis,\r\nrecollecting the losses which he had several times sustained before it,\r\nand turned to the right by a circuitous path, hoping either to subdue by\r\nforce or to win by bribes the garrison of Bezabde, which its founders\r\nalso called Phoenice, and to make himself master of that town, which\r\nis an exceedingly strong fortress, placed on a hill of moderate height,\r\nand close to the banks of the Tigris, having a double wall, as many\r\nplaces have which from their situation are thought to be especially\r\nexposed. For its defence three legions had been assigned; the second\r\nFlavian, the second Armenian, and the second Parthian, with a large body\r\nof archers of the Zabdiceni, a tribe subject to us, in whose territory\r\nthis town was situated.\r\n\r\n2. At the beginning of the siege, the king, with an escort of glittering\r\ncuirassiers, himself taller than any of them, rode entirely round the\r\ncamp, coming up boldly to the very edge of the fosse, where he was at\r\nonce a mark for the unerring bullets of the balistæ, and arrows; but he\r\nwas so completely covered with thick scale-armour that he retired\r\nunhurt.\r\n\r\n3. Then laying aside his anger, he sent some heralds with all due\r\nsolemnity, courteously inviting the besieged to consult the safety of\r\ntheir lives, and seeing the desperateness of their situation, to put an\r\nend to the siege by a timely surrender; to open their gates and come\r\nforth, presenting themselves as suppliants before the conqueror of\r\nnations.\r\n\r\n4. When these messengers approached the walls, the garrison spared them\r\nbecause they had with them some men of noble birth, who had been made\r\nprisoners at Singara, and were well known to the citizens; and out of\r\npity to them no one shot an arrow, though they would give no reply to\r\nthe proposal of peace.\r\n\r\n5. Then a truce being made for a day and night, before dawn on the\r\nsecond day the entire force of the Persians attacked the palisade with\r\nferocious threats and cries, coming up boldly to the walls, where a\r\nfierce contest ensued, the citizens resisting with great vigour.\r\n\r\n6. So that many of the Parthians[112] were wounded, because some of\r\nthem carrying ladders, and others wicker screens, advanced as it were\r\nblindfold, and were not spared by our men. For the clouds of arrows flew\r\nthickly, piercing the enemy packed in close order. At last, after sunset\r\nthe two sides separated, having suffered about equal loss: and the next\r\nday before dawn the combat was renewed with greater vehemence than\r\nbefore, the trumpets cheering the men on both sides, and again a\r\nterrible slaughter of each took place, both armies struggling with the\r\nmost determined obstinacy.\r\n\r\n7. But on the following day both armies by common consent rested from\r\ntheir terrible exertions, the defenders of the walls and the Persians\r\nbeing equally dismayed. When a Christian priest made sign by gestures\r\nthat he desired to go forth, and having received a promise that he\r\nshould be allowed to return in safety, he advanced to the king's tent.\r\n\r\n8. When he was permitted to speak, he, with gentle language, urged the\r\nPersians to depart to their own country, affirming that after the losses\r\neach side had sustained they had reason perhaps to fear even greater\r\ndisasters in future. But these and other similar arguments were uttered\r\nto no purpose. The fierce madness of the king robbing them of their\r\neffect, as Sapor swore positively that he would never retire till he had\r\ndestroyed our camp.\r\n\r\n9. Nevertheless a groundless suspicion was whispered against the bishop,\r\nwholly false in my opinion, though supported by the assertions of many,\r\nthat he had secretly informed Sapor what part of the wall to attack, as\r\nbeing internally slight and weak. Though the suspicion derived some\r\ncorroboration from the fact that afterwards the engines of the enemy\r\nwere carefully and with great exultation directed against the places\r\nwhich were weakest, or most decayed, as if those who worked them were\r\nacquainted with what parts were most easily penetrable.\r\n\r\n10. And although the narrowness of the causeway made the approach to the\r\nwalls hard, and though the battering-rams when equipped were brought\r\nforward with great difficulty, from fear of the stones and arrows hurled\r\nupon the assailants by the besieged, still neither the balistæ nor the\r\nscorpions rested a moment, the first shooting javelins, and the latter\r\nhurling showers of stones, and baskets on fire, smeared with pitch and\r\ntar; and as these were perpetually rolled down, the engines halted as if\r\nrooted to the ground, and fiery darts and firebrands well-aimed set them\r\non fire.\r\n\r\n11. Still while this was going on, and numbers were falling on both\r\nsides, the besiegers were the more eager to destroy a town, strong both\r\nby its natural situation and its powerful defences, before the arrival\r\nof winter, thinking it impossible to appease the fury of their king if\r\nthey should fail. Therefore neither abundant bloodshed nor the sight of\r\nnumbers of their comrades pierced with deadly wounds could deter the\r\nrest from similar audacity.\r\n\r\n12. But for a long time, fighting with absolute desperation, they\r\nexposed themselves to imminent danger; while those who worked the\r\nbattering-rams were prevented from advancing by the vast weight of\r\nmillstones, and all kinds of fiery missiles hurled against them.\r\n\r\n13. One battering-ram was higher than the rest, and was covered with\r\nbull's hides wetted, and being therefore safer from any accident of\r\nfire, or from lighted javelins, it led the way in the attacks on the\r\nwall with mighty blows, and with its terrible point it dug into the\r\njoints of the stones till it overthrew the tower. The tower fell with a\r\nmighty crash, and those in it were thrown down with a sudden jerk, and\r\nbreaking their limbs, or being buried beneath the ruins, perished by\r\nvarious and unexpected kinds of death; then, a safer entrance having\r\nbeen thus found, the multitude of the enemy poured in with their arms.\r\n\r\n14. While the war-cry of the Persians sounded in the trembling ears of\r\nthe defeated garrison, a fierce battle within the narrower bounds raged\r\nwithin the walls, while bands of our men and of the enemy fought hand to\r\nhand, being jammed together, with swords drawn on both sides, and no\r\nquarter given.\r\n\r\n15. At last the besieged, after making head with mighty exertion against\r\nthe destruction which long seemed doubtful, were overwhelmed with the\r\nweight of the countless host which pressed upon them. And the swords of\r\nthe furious foe cut down all they could find; children were torn from\r\ntheir mother's bosom, and the mothers were slain, no one regarding what\r\nhe did. Among these mournful scenes the Persians, devoted to plunder,\r\nloaded with every kind of booty, and driving before them a vast\r\nmultitude of prisoners, returned in triumph to their tents.\r\n\r\n16. But the king, elated with insolence and triumph, having long been\r\ndesirous to obtain possession of Phoenice, as a most important\r\nfortress, did not retire till he had repaired in the strongest manner\r\nthat portion of the walls which had been shaken, and till he had stocked\r\nit with ample magazines of provisions, and placed in it a garrison of\r\nmen noble by birth and eminent for their skill in war. For he feared\r\n(what indeed happened) that the Romans, being indignant at the loss of\r\nthis their grand camp, would exert themselves with all their might to\r\nrecover it.\r\n\r\n17. Then, being full of exultation, and cherishing greater hopes than\r\never of gaining whatever he desired, after taking a few forts of small\r\nimportance, he prepared to attack Victa, a very ancient fortress,\r\nbelieved to have been founded by Alexander, the Macedonian, situated on\r\nthe most distant border of Mesopotamia, and surrounded with winding\r\nwalls full of projecting angles, and so well furnished at all points as\r\nto be almost unassailable.\r\n\r\n18. And when he had tried every expedient against it, at one time trying\r\nto bribe the garrison with promises, at another to terrify them with\r\nthreats of torture, and employing all kinds of engines such as are used\r\nin sieges, after sustaining more injury than he inflicted, he at last\r\nretired from his unsuccessful enterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. These were the events of this year between the Tigris and the\r\nEuphrates. And when frequent intelligence of them had reached\r\nConstantius, who was in continual dread of Parthian expeditions, and was\r\npassing the winter at Constantinople, he devoted greater care than ever\r\nto strengthening his frontiers with every kind of warlike equipment. He\r\ncollected veterans, and enlisted recruits, and increased the legions\r\nwith reinforcements of vigorous youths, who had already repeatedly\r\nsignalized their valour in the battles of the eastern campaigns: and\r\nbeside these he collected auxiliary forces from among the Scythians by\r\nurgent requests and promises of pay, in order to set out from Thrace in\r\nthe spring, and at once march to the disturbed provinces.\r\n\r\n2. During the same time Julian, who was wintering at Paris, alarmed at\r\nthe prospect of the ultimate issue of the events in that district,\r\nbecame full of anxiety, feeling sure, after deep consideration, that\r\nConstantius would never give his consent to what had been done in his\r\ncase, since he had always disdained him as a person of no importance.\r\n\r\n3. Therefore, after much reflection on the somewhat disturbed beginning\r\nwhich the present novel state of affairs showed, he determined to send\r\nenvoys to him to relate all that had taken place; and he gave them\r\nletters setting forth fully what had been done, and what ought to be\r\ndone next, supporting his recommendations by proofs.\r\n\r\n4. Although in reality he believed that the emperor was already informed\r\nof all, from the report of Decentius, who had returned to him some time\r\nbefore; and of the chamberlains who had recently gone back from Gaul,\r\nafter having brought him some formal orders. And although he was not in\r\nreality vexed at his promotion, still he avoided all arrogant language\r\nin his letters, that he might not appear to have suddenly shaken off his\r\nauthority. Now the following was the purport of his letters.\r\n\r\n5. \"I have at all times been of the same mind, and have adhered to my\r\noriginal intentions, not less by my conduct than by my promises, as far\r\nas lay in my power, as has been abundantly plain from repeated actions\r\nof mine.\r\n\r\n6. \"And up to this time, since you created me Cæsar, and exposed me to\r\nthe din of war, contented with the power you conferred on me, as a\r\nfaithful officer I have sent you continued intelligence of all your\r\naffairs proceeding according to your wishes; never speaking of my own\r\ndangers; though it can easily be proved, that, while the Germans have\r\nbeen routed in every direction, I have always been the first in all\r\ntoils and the last to allow myself any rest.\r\n\r\n7. \"But allow me to say, that if any violent change has taken place, as\r\nyou think, the soldier who has been passing his life in many terrible\r\nwars without reward, has only completed what he has long had under\r\nconsideration, being indignant and impatient at being only under a chief\r\nof the second class, as knowing that from a Cæsar no adequate reward for\r\nhis continued exertions and frequent victories could possibly be\r\nprocured.\r\n\r\n8. \"And while angry at the feeling that he could neither expect\r\npromotion nor annual pay, he had this sudden aggravation to his\r\ndiscontent, that he, a man used to cold climates, was ordered to march\r\nto the most remote districts of the East, to be separated from his wife\r\nand children, and to be dragged away in want and nakedness. This made\r\nhim fiercer than usual; and so the troops one night collected and laid\r\nsiege to the palace, saluting with loud and incessant outcries Julian as\r\nemperor.\r\n\r\n9. \"I shuddered at their boldness, I confess, and withdrew myself. And\r\nretiring while I could, I sought safety in concealment and disguise--and\r\nas they would not desist, armed, so to say, with the shield of my own\r\nfree heart, I came out before them all, thinking that the tumult might\r\nbe appeased by authority, or by conciliatory language.\r\n\r\n10. \"They became wonderfully excited, and proceeded to such lengths\r\nthat, when I endeavoured to overcome their pertinacity with my\r\nentreaties, they came close up to me, threatening me with instant death.\r\nAt last I was overcome, and arguing with myself that if I were murdered\r\nby them some one else would willingly accept the dignity of emperor, I\r\nconsented, hoping thus to pacify their armed violence.\r\n\r\n11. \"This is the plain account of what has been done; and I entreat you\r\nto listen to it with mildness. Do not believe that anything else is the\r\ntruth; and do not listen to malignant men who deal in mischievous\r\nwhispers, always eager to seek their own gain by causing ill will\r\nbetween princes. Banish flattery, which is the nurse of vice, and listen\r\nto the voice of that most excellent of all virtues, justice. And receive\r\nwith good faith the equitable condition which I propose, considering in\r\nyour mind that such things are for the interest of the Roman state, and\r\nof us also who are united by affection of blood, and by an equality of\r\nsuperior fortune.\r\n\r\n12. \"And pardon me. These reasonable requests of mine I am not so\r\nanxious to see carried out, as to see them approved by you as expedient\r\nand proper; and I shall with eagerness follow all your instructions.\r\n\r\n13. \"What requires to be done I will briefly explain. I will provide you\r\nsome Spanish draught horses, and some youths to mingle with the Gentiles\r\nand Scutarii of the Letian tribe, a race of barbarians on the side of\r\nthe Rhine; or else of those people which have come over to our side. And\r\nI promise till the end of my life to do all I can to assist you, not\r\nonly with gratitude, but with eagerness.\r\n\r\n14. \"Your clemency will appoint us prefects for our prætorium of known\r\nequity and virtue: the appointment of the ordinary judges, and the\r\npromotion of the military officers it is fair should be left to me; as\r\nalso the selection of my guard. For it would be unreasonable, when it is\r\npossible to be guarded against, that those persons should be placed\r\nabout an emperor of whose manners and inclinations he is ignorant.\r\n\r\n15. \"These things I can further assure you of positively. The Gauls will\r\nneither of their own accord, nor by any amount of compulsion, be brought\r\nto send recruits to foreign and distant countries, since they have been\r\nlong harassed by protracted annoyances and heavy disasters, lest the\r\nyouth of the nation should be destroyed, and the whole people, while\r\nrecollecting their past sufferings, should abandon themselves to despair\r\nfor the future.\r\n\r\n16. \"Nor is it fit to seek from hence assistance against the Parthians,\r\nwhen even now the attempts of the barbarians against this land are not\r\nbrought to an end, and while, if you will suffer me to tell the truth,\r\nthese provinces are still exposed to continual dangers on being deprived\r\nof all foreign or adequate assistance.\r\n\r\n17. \"In speaking thus, I do think I have written to you in a manner\r\nsuited to the interests of the state, both in my demands and my\r\nentreaties. For I well know, not to speak in a lofty tone, though such\r\nmight not misbecome an emperor, what wretched states of affairs, even\r\nwhen utterly desperate and given up, have been before now retrieved and\r\nre-established by the agreement of princes, each yielding reciprocally\r\nto one another. While it is also plain from the example of our\r\nancestors, that rulers who acknowledge and act upon such principles do\r\nsomehow ever find the means of living prosperously and happily, and\r\nleave behind them to the latest posterity an enviable fame.\"\r\n\r\n18. To these letters he added others of a more secret purport, to be\r\ngiven privily to Constantius, in which he blamed and reproached him;\r\nthough their exact tenor was not fit to be known, nor if known, fit to\r\nbe divulged to the public.\r\n\r\n19. For the office of delivering these letters, men of great dignity\r\nwere chosen; namely, Pentadius, the master of the ceremonies, and\r\nEutherius, at that time the principal chamberlain; who were charged,\r\nafter they had delivered the letters, to relate what they had seen,\r\nwithout suppressing anything; and to take their own measures boldly on\r\nall future emergencies which might arise.\r\n\r\n20. In the mean time the flight of Florentius, the prefect, aggravated\r\nthe envy with which these circumstances were regarded. For he, as if he\r\nforesaw the commotion likely to arise, as might be gathered from general\r\nconversation, from the act of sending for the troops, had departed for\r\nVienne (being also desirous to get out of the way of Julian, whom he had\r\noften slandered), pretending to be compelled to this journey for the\r\nsake of providing supplies for the army.\r\n\r\n21. Afterwards, when he had heard of Julian's being raised to the\r\ndignity of emperor, being greatly alarmed, and giving up almost all hope\r\nof saving his life, he availed himself of his distance from Julian to\r\nescape from the evils which he suspected; and leaving behind him all his\r\nfamily, he proceeded by slow journeys to Constantius; and to prove his\r\nown innocence he brought forward many charges of rebellion against\r\nJulian.\r\n\r\n22. And after his departure, Julian, adopting wise measures, and wishing\r\nit to be known that, even if he had him in his power, he would have\r\nspared him, allowed his relations to take with them all their property,\r\nand even granted them the use of the public conveyances to retire with\r\nsafety to the East.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\n§ 1. The envoys whom I have mentioned took equal care to discharge their\r\norders; but while eager to pursue their journey they were unjustly\r\ndetained by some of the superior magistrates on their road; and having\r\nbeen long and vexatiously delayed in Italy and Illyricum, they at last\r\npassed the Bosphorus, and advancing by slow journeys, they found\r\nConstantius still staying at Cæsarea in Cappadocia, a town formerly\r\nknown as Mazaca, admirably situated at the foot of Mount Argæus, and of\r\nhigh reputation.\r\n\r\n2. Being admitted to the presence, they received permission to present\r\ntheir letters; but when they were read the emperor became immoderately\r\nangry, and looking askance at them so as to make them fear for their\r\nlives, he ordered them to be gone without asking them any questions or\r\npermitting them to speak.\r\n\r\n3. But in spite of his anger he was greatly perplexed to decide whether\r\nto move those troops whom he could trust against the Persians, or\r\nagainst Julian; and while he was hesitating, and long balancing between\r\nthe two plans, he yielded to the useful advice of some of his\r\ncounsellors, and ordered the army to march to the East.\r\n\r\n4. Immediately also he dismissed the envoys, and ordered his quæstor\r\nLeonas to go with all speed with letters from him to Julian; in which he\r\nasserted that he himself would permit no innovators, and recommended\r\nJulian, if he had any regard for his own safety or that of his\r\nrelations, to lay aside his arrogance, and resume the rank of Cæsar.\r\n\r\n5. And, in order to alarm him by the magnitude of his preparations, as\r\nif he really was possessed of great power, he appointed Nebridius, who\r\nwas at that time Julian's quæstor, to succeed Florentius as prefect of\r\nthe prætorium, and made Felix the secretary, master of the ceremonies,\r\nwith several other appointments. Gumoharius, the commander of the heavy\r\ninfantry, he had already appointed to succeed Lupicinus, before any of\r\nthese events were known.\r\n\r\n6. Accordingly Leonas reached Paris, and was there received as an\r\nhonourable and discreet man; and the next day, when Julian had proceeded\r\ninto the plain in front of the camp with a great multitude of soldiers\r\nand common people, which he had ordered to assemble on purpose, he\r\nmounted a tribune, in order from that high position to be more\r\nconspicuous, and desired Leonas to present his letters; and when he had\r\nopened the edict which had been sent, and began to read it, as soon as\r\nhe arrived at the passage that Constantius disapproved of all that had\r\nbeen done, and desired Julian to be content with the power of a Cæsar, a\r\nterrible shout was raised on all sides,\r\n\r\n7. \"Julian emperor, as has been decreed by the authority of the\r\nprovince, of the army, and of the republic; which is indeed\r\nre-established, but which still dreads the renewed attacks of the\r\nbarbarians.\"\r\n\r\n8. Leonas heard this, and, after receiving letters from Julian, stating\r\nwhat had occurred, was dismissed in safety: the only one of the\r\nemperor's appointments which was allowed to take effect was that of\r\nNebridius, which Julian in his letters had plainly said would be in\r\naccordance with his wishes. For he himself had some time before\r\nappointed Anatolius to be master of the ceremonies, having been formerly\r\nhis private secretary; and he had also made such other appointments as\r\nseemed useful and safe.\r\n\r\n9. And since, while matters were going on in this matter, Lupicinus, as\r\nbeing a proud and arrogant man, was an object of fear, though absent and\r\nstill in Britain; and since there was a suspicion that if he heard of\r\nthese occurrences while on the other side of the channel, he might cause\r\ndisorders in the island, a secretary was sent to Boulogne to take care\r\nthat no one should be allowed to cross; and as that was contrived,\r\nLupicinus returned without hearing of any of these matters, and so had\r\nno opportunity of giving trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\n§ 1. But Julian, being gratified at his increase of rank, and at the\r\nconfidence of the soldiers in him, not to let his good fortune cool, or\r\nto give any colour for charging him with inactivity or indolence, after\r\nhe had sent his envoys to Constantius, marched to the frontier of the\r\nprovince of lower Germany; and having with him all the force which the\r\nbusiness in hand demanded, he approached the town of Santon.[113]\r\n\r\n2. Then crossing the Rhine, he suddenly entered the district belonging\r\nto a Frank tribe, called the Attuarii, men of a turbulent character, who\r\nat that very moment were licentiously plundering the districts of Gaul.\r\nHe attacked them unexpectedly while they were apprehensive of no hostile\r\nmeasures, but were reposing in fancied security, relying on the\r\nruggedness and difficulty of the roads which led into their country, and\r\nwhich no prince within their recollection had ever penetrated. He,\r\nhowever, easily surmounted all difficulties, and having put many to the\r\nsword and taken many prisoners, he granted the survivors peace at their\r\nrequest, thinking such a course best for their neighbours.\r\n\r\n3. Then with equal celerity he repassed the river, and examining\r\ncarefully the state of the garrisons on the frontier, and putting them\r\nin a proper state, he marched towards Basle; and having recovered the\r\nplaces which the barbarians had taken and still retained in their hands,\r\nand having carefully strengthened them, he went to Vienne, passing\r\nthrough Besançon, and there took up his winter quarters.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\n§ 1. These were the events which took place in Gaul, and while they were\r\nthus conducted with prudence and good fortune, Constantius, having\r\nsummoned Arsaces, king of Armenia, and having received him with great\r\ncourtesy, advised and exhorted him to continue friendly and faithful to\r\nus.\r\n\r\n2. For he had heard that the king of Persia had often tried by deceits\r\nand threats, and all kinds of stratagems, to induce him to forsake the\r\nRoman alliance and join his party.\r\n\r\n3. But he, vowing with many oaths that he would rather lose his life\r\nthan change his opinion, received ample rewards, and returned to his\r\nkingdom with the retinue which he brought with him; and never ventured\r\nat any subsequent time to break any of his promises, being bound by\r\nmany ties of gratitude to Constantius. The strongest tie of all being\r\nthat the emperor had given him for a wife, Olympias, the daughter of\r\nAbladius, formerly prefect of the prætorium, who had once been betrothed\r\nto his own brother Constans.\r\n\r\n4. And when Arsaces had been dismissed, Constantius left Cappadocia, and\r\ngoing by Melitina, a town of the lesser Armenia, and Lacotene, and\r\nSamosata, he crossed the Euphrates and arrived at Edessa. Stopping some\r\ntime in each town, while waiting for divisions of soldiers who were\r\nflocking in from all quarters, and for sufficient supplies of\r\nprovisions. And after the autumnal equinox, he proceeded onwards on his\r\nway to Amida.\r\n\r\n5. When he approached the walls of that town, and saw everything buried\r\nin ashes, he groaned and wept, recollecting what sufferings the wretched\r\ncity had suffered. And Ursulus, the treasurer, who happened to be\r\npresent, was moved with indignation, and exclaimed, \"Behold the courage\r\nwith which cities are defended by our soldiers; men for whose pay the\r\nwhole wealth of the empire is exhausted.\" This bitter speech the crowd\r\nof soldiers afterwards recollected at Chalcedon, when they rose up and\r\ndestroyed him.\r\n\r\n6. Then proceeding onward in close column, he reached Bezabde, and\r\nhaving fixed his camp there, and fortified it with a rampart and a deep\r\nfosse, as he took a long ride round the camp, he satisfied himself, by\r\nthe account which he received from several persons, that those places in\r\nthe walls which the carelessness of ancient times had allowed to become\r\ndecayed, had been repaired so as to be stronger than ever.\r\n\r\n7. And, not to omit anything which was necessary to do before the heat\r\nof the contest was renewed, he sent prudent men to the garrison to offer\r\nthem two conditions; either to withdraw to their own country, giving up\r\nwhat did not belong to them, without causing bloodshed by resistance, or\r\nelse to become subjects of the Romans, in which case they should receive\r\nrank and rewards. But when they, with native obstinacy, resisted the\r\ndemands as became men of noble birth, who had been hardened by dangers\r\nand labours, everything was prepared for the siege.\r\n\r\n8. Therefore the soldiers with alacrity, in dense order, and cheered by\r\nthe sound of trumpets, attacked every side of the town; and the legions,\r\nbeing protected by various kinds of defences, advanced in safety,\r\nendeavouring by slow degrees to overthrow the walls; and because all\r\nkinds of missiles were poured down upon them, which disjoined the union\r\nof their shields, they fell back, the signal for a retreat being given.\r\n\r\n9. Then a truce was agreed upon for one day; but the day after, having\r\nprotected themselves more skilfully, they again raised their war-cry,\r\nand tried on every side to scale the walls. And although the garrison,\r\nhaving stretched cloths before them not to be distinguished, lay\r\nconcealed within the walls; still, as often as necessity required, they\r\nboldly put out their arms and hurled down stones and javelins on their\r\nassailants below.\r\n\r\n10. And while the wicker penthouses were advanced boldly and brought\r\nclose to the walls, the besieged dropped upon them heavy casks and\r\nmillstones, and fragments of pillars, by the overpowering weight of\r\nwhich the assailants were crushed, their defences torn to pieces, and\r\nwide openings made in them, so that they incurred terrible dangers, and\r\nwere again forced to retreat.\r\n\r\n11. Therefore, on the tenth day from the beginning of the siege, when\r\nthe confidence of our men began to fill the town with alarm, we\r\ndetermined on bringing up a vast battering-ram, which, after having\r\ndestroyed Antioch with it sometime before, the Persians had left at\r\nCarrhæ; and as soon as that appeared, and was begun to be skilfully set\r\nup, it cowed the spirits of the besieged, so that they were almost on\r\nthe point of surrendering, when they again plucked up courage and\r\nprepared means for resisting this engine.\r\n\r\n12. From this time neither their courage nor their ingenuity failed; for\r\nas the ram was old, and it had been taken to pieces for the facility of\r\ntransporting it, so while it was being put together again, it was\r\nattacked with great exertions and vigour by the garrison, and defended\r\nwith equal valour and firmness by the besiegers; and engines hurling\r\nshowers of stones, and slings, and missiles of all sorts, slew numbers\r\non each side. Meantime, high mounds rose up with speedy growth; and the\r\nsiege grew fiercer and sterner daily; many of our men being slain\r\nbecause, fighting as they were under the eye of the emperor, and eager\r\nfor reward, they took off their helmets in order to be the more easily\r\nrecognized, and so with bare heads, were an easy mark for the skilful\r\narchers of the enemy.\r\n\r\n13. The days and nights being alike spent in watching, made each side\r\nthe more careful; and the Persians, being alarmed at the vast height to\r\nwhich the mounds were now carried, and at the enormous ram, which was\r\naccompanied by others of smaller size, made great exertions to burn\r\nthem, and kept continually shooting firebrands and incendiary missiles\r\nat them; but their labour was vain, because the chief part of them was\r\ncovered with wet skins and cloths, and some parts also had been steeped\r\nin alum, so that the fire might fall harmless upon them.\r\n\r\n14. But the Romans, driving these rams on with great courage, although\r\nthey had difficulty in defending themselves, disregarded danger, however\r\nimminent, in the hope of making themselves masters of the town.\r\n\r\n15. And on the other hand, when the enormous ram was brought against the\r\ntower to which it was applied, as if it could at once throw it down, the\r\ngarrison, by a clever contrivance, entangled its projecting iron head,\r\nwhich in shape was like that of a ram, with long cords on both sides, to\r\nprevent its being drawn back and then driven forward with great force,\r\nand to hinder it from making any serious impression on the walls by\r\nrepeated blows; and meanwhile they poured on it burning pitch, and for a\r\nlong time these engines were fixed at the point to which they had been\r\nadvanced, and exposed to all the stones and javelins which were hurled\r\nfrom the walls.\r\n\r\n16. By this time the mounds were raised to a considerable height, and\r\nthe garrison, thinking that unless they used extraordinary vigilance\r\ntheir destruction must be at hand, resorted to extreme audacity; and\r\nmaking an unexpected sally from the gates, they attacked our front rank,\r\nand with all their might hurled firebrands and iron braziers loaded with\r\nfire against the rams.\r\n\r\n17. But after a fierce but undecided conflict, the bulk of them were\r\ndriven within the walls, without having succeeded in their attempt; and\r\npresently the battlements were attacked from the mounds which the Romans\r\nhad raised, with arrows and slings and lighted javelins, which flew\r\nover the roofs of the towers, but did no harm, means having been\r\nprepared to extinguish any flames.\r\n\r\n18. And as the ranks on both sides became thinner, and the Persians were\r\nnow reduced to extremities unless some aid could be found, they prepared\r\nwith redoubled energy a fresh sally from the camp: accordingly, they\r\nmade a sudden sally, supported by increased numbers, and among the armed\r\nmen were many bearing torches, and iron baskets full of fire, and\r\nfaggots; and all kinds of things best adapted for setting fire to the\r\nworks of the besiegers were hurled against them.\r\n\r\n19. And because the dense clouds of smoke obscured the sight, when the\r\ntrumpet gave the signal for battle, the legions came up with quick step;\r\nand as the eagerness of the conflict grew hotter, after they had\r\nengaged, suddenly all the engines, except the great ram, caught fire\r\nfrom the flames which were hurled at them; but the ropes which held the\r\nchief ram were broken asunder, and that the vigorous efforts of some\r\ngallant men saved, when it was half burnt.\r\n\r\n20. When the darkness of night terminated the combat, only a short time\r\nwas allowed to the soldiers for rest; but when they had been refreshed\r\nby a little food and sleep, they were awakened by their captains, and\r\nordered to remove their works away from the walls of the town, and\r\nprepare to fight at closer quarters from the lofty mounds which were\r\nuntouched by the flames, and now commanded the walls. And to drive the\r\ndefenders from the walls, on the summit of the mounds they stationed two\r\nbalistæ, in fear of which they thought that none of the enemy would\r\nventure even to look out.\r\n\r\n21. After having taken these efficacious measures, a triple line of our\r\nmen, having a more threatening aspect than usual from the nodding cones\r\nof their helmets (many of them also bearing ladders), attempted about\r\ntwilight to scale the walls. Arms clashed and trumpets sounded, and both\r\nsides fought with equal boldness and ardour. The Romans, extending their\r\nlines more widely, when they saw the Persians hiding from fear of the\r\nengines which had been stationed on the mounds, battered the wall with\r\ntheir ram, and with spades, and axes, and levers, and ladders, pressed\r\nfiercely on, while missiles from each side flew without ceasing.\r\n\r\n22. But the Persians were especially pressed by the various missiles\r\nshot from the balistæ, which, from the artificial mounds, came down upon\r\nthem in torrents; and having become desperate, they rushed on, fearless\r\nof death, and distributing their force as if at the last extremity, they\r\nleft some to guard the walls, while the rest, secretly opening a postern\r\ngate, rushed forth valiantly with drawn swords, followed by others who\r\ncarried concealed fire.\r\n\r\n23. And while the Romans at one moment were pressing on those who\r\nretreated, at another receiving the assault of those who attacked them,\r\nthose who carried the fire crept round by a circuitous path, and pushed\r\nthe burning coals in among the interstices of one of the mounds, which\r\nwas made up of branches of trees, and rushes, and bundles of reeds. This\r\nsoon caught fire and was utterly destroyed, the soldiers themselves\r\nhaving great difficulty in escaping and saving their engines.\r\n\r\n24. But when the approach of evening broke off the conflict, and the two\r\nsides separated to snatch a brief repose, the emperor, after due\r\nreflection, resolved to change his plans. Although many reasons of great\r\nurgency pressed him to force on the destruction of Phoenice, as of a\r\nfortress which would prove an impregnable barrier to the inroads of the\r\nenemy, yet the lateness of the season was an objection to persevering\r\nany longer. He determined, therefore, while he preserved his position,\r\nto carry on the siege for the future by slight skirmishes, thinking that\r\nthe Persians would be forced to surrender from want of provisions,\r\nwhich, however, turned out very different.\r\n\r\n25. For while the conflict was proceeding sharply, the heavens became\r\nmoist, and watery clouds appeared with threatening darkness; and\r\npresently the ground got so wet from continual rain, that the whole\r\ncountry was changed into an adhesive mud (for the soil is naturally\r\nrich), and every plan was thrown into confusion; meantime, thunder with\r\nincessant crashes and ceaseless lightning filled men's minds with fear.\r\n\r\n26. To these portents were added continual rainbows. A short explanation\r\nwill serve to show how these appearances are formed. The vapours of the\r\nearth becoming warmer, and the watery particles gathering in clouds, and\r\nthence being dispersed in spray, and made brilliant by the fusion of\r\nrays, turn upwards towards the fiery orb of the sun and form a rainbow,\r\nwhich sweeps round with a large curve because it is spread over our\r\nworld, which physical investigations place on the moiety of a sphere.\r\n\r\n27. Its appearance, as far as mortal sight can discern, is, in the first\r\nline yellow, in the second tawny, in the third scarlet, in the fourth\r\npurple, and in the last a mixture of blue and green.\r\n\r\n28. And it is so tempered with this mixed beauty, as mankind believe,\r\nbecause its first portion is discerned in a thin diluted state, of the\r\nsame colour as the air which surrounds it; the next line is tawny, that\r\nis a somewhat richer colour than yellow; the third is scarlet, because\r\nit is opposite to the bright rays of the sun, and so pumps up and\r\nappropriates, if one may so say, the most subtle portion of its beams;\r\nthe fourth is purple, because the density of the spray by which the\r\nsplendour of the sun's rays is quenched shines between, and so it\r\nassumes a colour near that of flame; and as that colour is the more\r\ndiffused, it shades off into blue and green.\r\n\r\n29. Others think that the rainbow is caused by the rays of the sun\r\nbecoming infused into some dense cloud, and pouring into it a liquid\r\nlight, which, as it can find no exit, falls back upon itself, and shines\r\nthe more brilliantly because of a kind of attrition; and receives those\r\nhues which are most akin to white from the sun above; its green hues\r\nfrom the cloud under which it lies, as often happens in the sea, where\r\nthe waters which beat upon the shore are white, and those farther from\r\nthe land, which, as being so, are more free from any admixture, are\r\nblue.\r\n\r\n30. And since it is an indication of a change in the atmosphere (as we\r\nhave already said), when in a clear sky sudden masses of clouds appear,\r\nor on the other hand, when the sky changed from a gloomy look to a\r\njoyful serenity, therefore we often read in the poets that Iris is sent\r\nfrom heaven when a change is required in the condition of any present\r\naffairs. There are various other opinions which it would be superfluous\r\nnow to enumerate, since my narration must hasten back to the point from\r\nwhich it digressed.\r\n\r\n31. By these and similar events the emperor was kept wavering between\r\nhope and fear, as the severity of winter was increasing, and he\r\nsuspected ambuscades in the country, which was destitute of roads;\r\nfearing also, among other things, the discontent of the exasperated\r\nsoldiers. And it further goaded his unquiet spirit to return balked of\r\nhis purpose, after, as it were, the door of the rich mansion was opened\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n32. However, giving up his enterprise as fruitless, he returned into the\r\nunwelcome Syria, to winter at Antioch, after having suffered a\r\nsuccession of melancholy disasters. For, as if some unfriendly\r\nconstellation so governed events, Constantius himself, while warring\r\nwith the Persians, was always attended by adverse fortune; on which\r\naccount he hoped at least to gain victories by means of his generals;\r\nand this, as we remember, usually happened.\r\n\r\n\r\n[109] \"The minute interval which may be interposed between the _hyeme\r\nadultâ_ and the _primo vere_ of Ammianus, instead of allowing a\r\nsufficient space for a march of three thousand miles, would render the\r\norders of Constantius as extravagant as they were unjust; the troops of\r\nGaul could not have reached Syria till the end of autumn. The memory of\r\nAmmianus must have been inaccurate, and his language\r\nincorrect.\"--Gibbon, c. xxii.\r\n\r\n[110] According to Erdfurt, this legion was so named from its\r\ncontumacious and mutinous disposition.\r\n\r\n[111] The Gentiles were body-guards of the emperor, or of the Cæsar, of\r\nbarbarian extraction, whether Scythians, Goths, Franks, Germans, &c.\r\n\r\n[112] It may be remarked that Ammianus continually uses the words\r\nPersian and Parthian as synonymous.\r\n\r\n[113] Santon is near Cleves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK XXI.\r\n\r\nARGUMENT.\r\n\r\n     I.

Julian having intercepted\r\n     letters of Vadomarius to the Emperor Constantius, contrives to have\r\n     him seized at a banquet; and having slain some of the Allemanni,\r\n     and compelled others to surrender, grants the rest peace at their\r\n     entreaty.--Julian harangues his soldiers, and makes them all\r\n     promise obedience to him, intending to make war upon the Emperor\r\n     Constantius.--VI.

Constantius, at that time at Antioch, retains Africa\r\n     in his power by means of his secretary Gaudentius; crosses the\r\n     Euphrates, and moves with his army upon Edessa.--VIII. After\r\n     settling the affairs of Gaul, Julian marches to the Danube, sending\r\n     on before a part of his army through Italy and the Tyrol.--IX.\r\n     Taurus and Florentius, consuls, and prefects of the prætorium, fly\r\n     at the approach of Julian, the one through Illyricum, the other\r\n     through Italy--Lucillianus, the commander of the cavalry, who was\r\n     preparing to resist Julian, is crushed by him.--X. Julian receives\r\n     the allegiance of Sirmium, the capital of Western Illyricum, and of\r\n     its garrison--Occupies the country of the Sacci, and writes to the\r\n     senate letters of complaint against Constantius.--XI. Two of the\r\n     legions of Constantius which at Sirmium had passed over to Julian\r\n     are sent by him into Gaul, and occupy Aquileia, with the consent of\r\n     the citizens, who, however, shut their gates against the troops of\r\n     Julian.--XII. Aquileia takes the part of Constantius, and is\r\n     besieged, but presently, when news of his death arrives, surrenders\r\n     to Julian.--XIII.

While Constantius was detained by this perplexing war beyond the\r\nEuphrates, Julian at Vienne devoted his days and nights to forming plans\r\nfor the future, as far as his limited resources would allow; being in\r\ngreat suspense, and continually doubting whether to try every expedient\r\nto win Constantius over to friendship, or to anticipate his attack, with\r\nthe view of alarming him.\r\n\r\n2. And while anxiously considering these points he feared him, as likely\r\nto be in the one case a cruel friend, while in the other case he\r\nrecollected that he had always been successful in civil disturbances.\r\nAbove all things his anxiety was increased by the example of his brother\r\nGallus, who had been betrayed by his own want of caution and the\r\nperjured deceit of certain individuals.\r\n\r\n3. Nevertheless he often raised himself to ideas of energetic action,\r\nthinking it safest to show himself as an avowed enemy to him whose\r\nmovements he could, as a prudent man, judge of only from his past\r\nactions, in order not to be entrapped by secret snares founded on\r\npretended friendship.\r\n\r\n4. Therefore, paying little attention to the letters which Constantius\r\nhad sent by Leonas, and admitting none of his appointments with the\r\nexception of that of Nebridius, he now celebrated the\r\nQuinquennalia[114] as emperor, and wore a splendid diadem inlaid with\r\nprecious stones, though when first entering on that power he had worn\r\nbut a paltry-looking crown like that of a president of the public games.\r\n\r\n5. At this time also he sent the body of his wife Helen, recently\r\ndeceased, to Rome, to be buried in the suburb on the road to Nomentum,\r\nwhere also Constantina, his sister-in-law, the wife of Gallus, had been\r\nburied.\r\n\r\n6. His desire to march against Constantius, now that Gaul was\r\ntranquillized, was inflamed by the belief which he had adopted from many\r\nomens (in the interpretation of which he had great skill), and from\r\ndreams that the emperor would soon die.\r\n\r\n7. And since malignant people have attributed to this prince, so erudite\r\nand so eager to acquire all knowledge, wicked practices for the purpose\r\nof learning future events, we may here briefly point out how this\r\nimportant branch of learning may be acquired by a wise man.\r\n\r\n8. The spirit which directs all the elements, and which at all times and\r\nthroughout all places exercises its activity by the movement of these\r\neternal bodies, can communicate to us the capacity of foreseeing the\r\nfuture by the sciences which we attain through various kinds of\r\ndiscipline. And the ruling powers, when properly propitiated, as from\r\neverlasting springs, supply mankind with words of prophecy, over which\r\nthe deity of Themis is said to preside, and which, because she teaches\r\nmen to know what has been settled for the future by the law of Fate, has\r\nreceived that name from the Greek word +_tetheimena_+ (\"fixed\"),\r\nand has been placed by ancient theologians in the bed and on the throne\r\nof Jupiter, who gives life to all the world.\r\n\r\n9. Auguries and auspices are not collected from the will of birds who\r\nare themselves ignorant of the future (for there is no one so silly as\r\nto say they understand it); but God directs the flight of birds, so that\r\nthe sound of their beaks, or the motion of their feathers, whether quiet\r\nor disturbed, indicates the character of the future. For the kindness\r\nof the deity, whether it be that men deserve it, or that he is touched\r\nby affection for them, likes by these acts to give information of what\r\nis impending.\r\n\r\n10. Again, those who attend to the prophetic entrails of cattle, which\r\noften take all kinds of shapes, learn from them what happens. Of this\r\npractice a man called Tages was the inventor, who, as is reported, was\r\ncertainly seen to rise up out of the earth in the district of Etruria.\r\n\r\n11. Men too, when their hearts are in a state of excitement, foretell\r\nthe future, but then they are speaking under divine inspiration. For the\r\nsun, which is, as natural philosophers say, the mind of the world, and\r\nwhich scatters our minds among us as sparks proceeding from itself, when\r\nit has inflamed them with more than usual vehemence, renders them\r\nconscious of the future. From which the Sibyls often say they are\r\nburning and fired by a vast power of flames; and with reference to these\r\ncases the sound of voices, various signs, thunder, lightning,\r\nthunderbolts, and falling stars, have a great significance.\r\n\r\n12. But the belief in dreams would be strong and undoubted if the\r\ninterpreters of them were never deceived; and sometimes, as Aristotle\r\nasserts, they are fixed and stable when the eye of the person, being\r\nsoundly asleep, turns neither way, but looks straight forward.\r\n\r\n13. And because the ignorance of the vulgar often talks loudly, though\r\nignorantly, against these ideas, asking why, if there were any faculty\r\nof foreseeing the future, one man should be ignorant that he would be\r\nkilled in battle, or another that he would meet with some misfortune,\r\nand so on; it will be enough to reply that sometimes a grammarian has\r\nspoken incorrectly, or a musician has sung out of tune, or a physician\r\nbeen ignorant of the proper remedy for a disease; but these facts do not\r\ndisprove the existence of the sciences of grammar, music, or medicine.\r\n\r\n14. So that Tully is right in this as well as other sayings of his, when\r\nhe says, \"Signs of future events are shown by the gods; if any one\r\nmistakes them he errs, not because of the nature of the gods, but\r\nbecause of the conjectures of men.\" But lest this discussion, running on\r\nthis point beyond the goal, as the proverb is, should disgust the\r\nreader, we will now return to relate what follows.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. While Julian, still with the rank of Cæsar only, was at Paris one\r\nday, exercising himself in the camp-field, and moving his shield in\r\nvarious directions, the joints by which it was fastened gave way, and\r\nthe handle alone remained in his hand, which he still held firmly, and\r\nwhen those present were alarmed, thinking it a bad omen, he said, \"Let\r\nno one be alarmed, I still hold firmly what I had before.\"\r\n\r\n2. And again, when one day after a slight dinner, he was sleeping at\r\nVienne, in the middle of the darkness of the night a figure of unusual\r\nsplendour appeared to him, and when he was all but awake, repeated to\r\nhim the following heroic verses, reciting them over and over again;\r\nwhich he believed, so that he felt sure that no ill fortune remained for\r\nhim:--\r\n\r\n  \"When Jove has passed the water-carrier's sign,\r\n  And Saturn's light, for five-and-twenty days\r\n  Has lightened up the maid; the king divine\r\n  Of Asia's land shall enter on the ways\r\n  That painful lead to death and Styx's gloomy maze.\"\r\n\r\n3. Therefore in the mean time he made no change in the existing\r\ncondition of affairs, but arranged everything that occurred with a quiet\r\nand easy mind, gradually strengthening himself, in order to make the\r\nincrease of his power correspond with the increase of his dignity.\r\n\r\n4. And in order, without any hindrance, to conciliate the good-will of\r\nall men, he pretended to adhere to the Christian religion, which in fact\r\nhe had long since secretly abandoned, though very few were aware of his\r\nprivate opinions, giving up his whole attention to soothsaying and\r\ndivination, and the other arts which have always been practised by the\r\nworshippers of the gods.\r\n\r\n5. But to conceal this for a while, on the day of the festival at the\r\nbeginning of January, which the Christians call Epiphany, he went into\r\ntheir church, and offered solemn public prayer to their God.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. While these events were proceeding, and spring was coming on,\r\nJulian was suddenly smitten with grief and sorrow by unexpected\r\nintelligence. For he learnt that the Allemanni had poured forth from\r\nthe district of Vadomarius, in which quarter, after the treaty which had\r\nbeen made with him, no troubles had been anticipated, and were laying\r\nwaste the borders of the Tyrol, pouring their predatory hands over the\r\nwhole frontier, and leaving nothing unravaged.\r\n\r\n2. He feared that if this were passed over it might rekindle the flames\r\nof war; and so at once sent a count named Libino, with the Celtic and\r\nPetulantes legions, who were in winter quarters with him, to put a\r\ndecided and immediate end to this affair.\r\n\r\n3. Libino marched with speed, and arrived at Seckingen; but was seen\r\nwhile at a distance by the barbarians, who had already hidden themselves\r\nin the valleys with the intention of giving him battle. His soldiers\r\nwere inferior in number, but very eager for battle; and he, after\r\nharanguing them, rashly attacked the Germans, and at the very beginning\r\nof the fight was slain among the first. At his death the confidence of\r\nthe barbarians increased, while the Romans were excited to avenge their\r\ngeneral; and so the conflict proceeded with great obstinacy, but our men\r\nwere overpowered by numbers, though their loss in killed and wounded was\r\nbut small.\r\n\r\n4. Constantius, as has been related, had made peace with this\r\nVadomarius, and his brother Gundomadus, who was also a king. And when\r\nafterwards Gundomadus died, thinking that Vadomarius would be faithful\r\nto him, and a silent and vigorous executor of his secret orders (if one\r\nmay believe what is only report), he gave him directions by letter to\r\nharass the countries on his borders, as if he had broken off the treaty\r\nof peace, in order to keep Julian, through his fears of him, from ever\r\nabandoning the protection of Gaul.\r\n\r\n5. In obedience to these directions, it is fair to believe that\r\nVadomarius committed this and other similar actions; being a man from\r\nhis earliest youth marvellously skilled in artifice and deceit, as he\r\nafterwards showed when he enjoyed the dukedom of Phoenice.[115]\r\n\r\n6. But now, being discovered, he desisted from his hostilities. For one\r\nof his secretaries, whom he had sent to Constantius, was taken prisoner\r\nby Julian's outposts, and when he was searched to see if he was the\r\nbearer of anything, a letter was found on him, which contained these\r\nwords among others, \"Your Cæsar is not submissive.\" But when he wrote to\r\nJulian he always addressed him as lord, and emperor, and god.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n§ 1. These affairs were full of danger and doubt; and Julian considering\r\nthem likely to lead to absolute destruction, bent all his mind to the\r\none object of seizing Vadomarius unawares, through the rapidity of his\r\nmovements, in order to secure his own safety and that of the provinces.\r\nAnd the plan which he decided on was this.\r\n\r\n2. He sent to those districts Philagrius, one of his secretaries,\r\nafterwards count of the East, in whose proved prudence and fidelity he\r\ncould thoroughly rely; and besides a general authority to act as he\r\ncould upon emergencies, he gave him also a paper signed by himself,\r\nwhich he bade him not to open nor read unless Vadomarius appeared on the\r\nwestern side of the Rhine.\r\n\r\n3. Philagrius went as he was ordered, and while he was in that district\r\nbusying himself with various arrangements, Vadomarius crossed the river,\r\nas if he had nothing to fear, in a time of profound peace, and\r\npretending to know of nothing having been done contrary to treaty, when\r\nhe saw the commander of the troops who were stationed there, made him a\r\nshort customary speech, and to remove all suspicion, of his own accord\r\npromised to come to a banquet to which Philagrius also had been invited.\r\n\r\n4. As soon as Philagrius arrived, when he saw the king, he recollected\r\nJulian's words, and pretending some serious and urgent business,\r\nreturned to his lodging, where having read the paper intrusted to him,\r\nand learnt what he was to do, he immediately returned and took his seat\r\namong the rest.\r\n\r\n5. But when the banquet was over he boldly arrested Vadomarius, and gave\r\nhim to the commander of the forces, to be kept in strict custody in the\r\ncamp, reading to him the commands he had received; but as nothing was\r\nmentioned about Vadomarius's retinue, he ordered them to return to their\r\nown country.\r\n\r\n6. But the king was afterwards conducted to Julian's camp, and\r\ndespaired of pardon when he heard that his secretary had been taken, and\r\nthe letters which he had written to Constantius read; he was however not\r\neven reproached by Julian, but merely sent off to Spain, as it was an\r\nobject of great importance that, while Julian was absent from Gaul, this\r\nferocious man should not be able to throw into confusion the provinces\r\nwhich had been tranquillized with such great difficulty.\r\n\r\n7. Julian, being much elated at this occurrence, since the king, whom he\r\nfeared to leave behind him while at a distance, had been caught more\r\nquickly than he expected, without delay prepared to attack the\r\nbarbarians who, as we have just related, had slain Count Libino and some\r\nof his soldiers in battle.\r\n\r\n8. And to prevent any rumour of his approach giving them warning to\r\nretire to remoter districts, he passed the Rhine by night with great\r\nsilence, with some of the most rapid of his auxiliary bands; and so came\r\nupon them while fearing nothing of the sort. And he at once attacked\r\nthem the moment they were first roused by the sound of enemies, and\r\nwhile still examining their swords and javelins; some he slew, some he\r\ntook prisoners, who sued for mercy and offered to surrender their booty;\r\nto the rest who remained and implored peace, and promised to be quiet\r\nfor the future, he granted peace.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n§ 1. While these transactions were carried on in this spirited manner,\r\nJulian, considering to what great internal divisions his conduct had\r\ngiven rise, and that nothing is so advantageous for the success of\r\nsudden enterprise as celerity of action, saw with his usual sagacity\r\nthat if he openly avowed his revolt from the emperor, he should be\r\nsafer; and feeling uncertain of the fidelity of the soldiers, having\r\noffered secret propitiatory sacrifices to Bellona, he summoned the army\r\nby sound of trumpet to an assembly, and standing on a tribune built of\r\nstone, with every appearance of confidence in his manner, he spoke thus\r\nwith a voice unusually loud:--\r\n\r\n2. \"I imagine that you, my gallant comrades, exalted by the greatness of\r\nyour own achievements, have long been silently expecting this meeting,\r\nin order to form a previous judgment of, and to take wise measures\r\nagainst the events which may be expected. For soldiers united by\r\nglorious actions ought to hear rather than speak; nor ought a commander\r\nof proved justice to think anything but what is worthy of praise and\r\napprobation. That therefore I may explain to you what I propose, I\r\nentreat you to listen favourably to what I will briefly set before you.\r\n\r\n3. \"From my earliest year, by the will of God, I have been placed among\r\nyou, with whom I have crushed the incessant inroads of the Franks and\r\nAllemanni, and checked the endless licentiousness of their ravages; by\r\nour united vigour we have opened the Rhine to the Roman armies, whenever\r\nthey choose to cross it; standing immovable against reports, as well as\r\nagainst the violent attacks of powerful nations, because I trusted to\r\nthe invincibility of your valour.\r\n\r\n4. \"Gaul, which has beheld our labours, and which, after much slaughter\r\nand many periods of protracted and severe disasters, is at last replaced\r\nin a healthy state, will for ever bear witness to posterity of our\r\nachievements.\r\n\r\n5. \"But now since, constrained both by the authority of your judgment,\r\nand also by the necessity of the case, I have been raised to the rank of\r\nemperor, under the favour of God and of you, I aim at still greater\r\nthings, if fortune should smile on my undertakings. Boasting at least\r\nthat I have secured to the army, whose equity and mighty exploits are so\r\nrenowned, a moderate and merciful chief in time of peace, and in war a\r\nprudent and wary leader against the combined forces of the barbarians.\r\n\r\n6. \"In order therefore that by the cordial unanimity of our opinions we\r\nmay prevent ill fortune by anticipating it, I beg you to follow my\r\ncounsel, salutary, as I think it, since the state of our affairs\r\ncorresponds to the purity of my intentions and wishes. And while the\r\nlegions of Illyricum are occupied by no greater force than usual, let us\r\noccupy the further frontier of Dacia; and then take counsel from our\r\nsuccess what is to be done next.\r\n\r\n7. \"But as brave generals, I entreat you to promise with an oath that\r\nyou will adhere to me with unanimity and fidelity; while I will give my\r\ncustomary careful attention to prevent anything from being done rashly\r\nor carelessly; and if any one requires it, will pledge my own unsullied\r\nhonour that I will never attempt nor think of anything but what is for\r\nthe common good.\r\n\r\n8 \"This especially I request and beseech you to observe, that none of\r\nyou let any impulse of sudden ardour lead you to inflict injury on any\r\nprivate individual; recollecting that our greatest renown is not derived\r\nso much from the numberless defeats of the enemy as from the safety of\r\nthe provinces, and their freedom from injury, which is celebrated as an\r\neminent example of our virtue.\"\r\n\r\n9. The emperor's speech was approved as though it had been the voice of\r\nan oracle, and the whole assembly was greatly excited, and being eager\r\nfor a change, they all with one consent raised a tremendous shout, and\r\nbeat their shields with a violent crash, calling him a great and noble\r\ngeneral, and, as had been proved, a fortunate conqueror and king.\r\n\r\n10. And being all ordered solemnly to swear fidelity to him, they put\r\ntheir swords to their throats with terrible curses, and took the oath in\r\nthe prescribed form, that for him they would undergo every kind of\r\nsuffering, and even death itself, if necessity should require it; and\r\ntheir officers and all the friends of the prince gave a similar pledge\r\nwith the same forms.\r\n\r\n11. Nebridius the prefect alone, boldly and unshakenly refused,\r\ndeclaring that he could not possibly bind himself by an oath hostile to\r\nConstantius, from whom he had received many and great obligations.\r\n\r\n12. When these words of his were heard, the soldiers who were nearest to\r\nhim were greatly enraged, and wished to kill him; but he threw himself\r\nat the feet of Julian, who shielded him with his cloak. Presently, when\r\nhe returned to the palace, Nebridius appeared before him, threw himself\r\nat his feet as a suppliant, and entreated him to relieve his fears by\r\ngiving him his right hand. Julian replied, \"Will there be any\r\nconspicuous favour reserved for my own friends if you are allowed to\r\ntouch my hand? However, depart in peace as you will.\" On receiving this\r\nanswer, Nebridius retired in safety to his own house in Tuscany.\r\n\r\n13. By these preliminary measures, Julian having learnt, as the\r\nimportance of the affair required, what great influence promptness and\r\nbeing beforehand has in a tumultuous state of affairs, gave the signal\r\nto march towards Pannonia, and advancing his standard and his camp,\r\nboldly committed himself to fickle fortune.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nA.D. 361.\r\n\r\n§ 1. It is fitting now to retrace our steps and to relate briefly what\r\n(while these events just related were taking place in Gaul) Constantius,\r\nwho passed the winter at Antioch, did, whether in peace or war.\r\n\r\n2. Besides many others of high rank, some of the most distinguished\r\ntribunes generally come to salute an emperor on his arrival from distant\r\nlands. And accordingly, when Constantius, on his return from\r\nMesopotamia, received this compliment, a Paphlagonian named\r\nAmphilochius, who had been a tribune, and whom suspicion, not very far\r\nremoved from the truth, hinted at as having, while serving formerly\r\nunder Constans, sown the seeds of discord between him and his brother,\r\nnow ventured, with no little audacity, to come forward as if he were to\r\nbe admitted to pay his duty in this way, but was recognized and refused\r\nadmittance. Many also raised an outcry against him, crying out that he,\r\nas a stubborn rebel, ought not to be permitted to see another day. But\r\nConstantius, on this occasion more merciful than usual, said, \"Cease to\r\npress upon a man who, indeed, as I believe, is guilty, but who has not\r\nbeen convicted. And remember that if he has done anything of the kind,\r\nhe, as long as he is in my sight, will be punished by the judgment of\r\nhis own conscience, which he will not be able to escape.\" And so he\r\ndeparted.\r\n\r\n3. The next day, at the Circensian games, the same man was present as a\r\nspectator, just opposite the usual seat of the emperor, when a sudden\r\nshout was raised at the moment of the commencement of the expected\r\ncontest; the barriers, on which he with many others was leaning, were\r\nbroken, and the whole crowd as well as he were thrown forward into the\r\nempty space; and though a few were slightly hurt, he alone was found to\r\nbe killed, having received some internal injury. At which Constantius\r\nrejoiced, prognosticating from this omen protection from his other\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\n4. About the same time (his wife Eusebia having died some time before)\r\nhe took another wife, named Faustina. Eusebia's brothers were two men of\r\nconsular rank, Hypatius and Eusebius. She had been a woman of\r\npre-eminent beauty both of person and character, and for one of her high\r\nrank most courteous and humane. And to her favour and justice it was\r\nowing, as we have already mentioned, that Julian was saved from danger\r\nand declared Cæsar.\r\n\r\n5. About the same time Florentius also was rewarded, who had quitted\r\nGaul from fear of a revolution. He was now appointed to succeed\r\nAnatolius, the prefect of the prætorium in Illyricum, who had lately\r\ndied. And in conjunction with Taurus, who was appointed to the same\r\noffice in Italy, he received the ensigns of this most honourable\r\ndignity.\r\n\r\n6. Nevertheless, the preparations for both foreign and civil wars went\r\non, the number of the squadrons of cavalry was augmented, and\r\nreinforcements for the legions were enlisted with equal zeal, recruits\r\nbeing collected all over the provinces. Also every class and profession\r\nwas exposed to annoyances, being called upon to furnish arms, clothes,\r\nmilitary engines, and even gold and silver and abundant stores of\r\nprovisions, and various kinds of animals.\r\n\r\n7. And because, as the king of Persia had been compelled unwillingly to\r\nfall back on account of the difficulties of the winter, it was feared\r\nthat as soon as the weather became open he would return with greater\r\nimpetuosity than ever, ambassadors were sent to the kings and satraps\r\nacross the Tigris, with splendid presents, to advise and entreat them\r\nall to join us, and abstain from all designs or plots against us.\r\n\r\n8. But the most important object of all was to win over Arsaces and\r\nMeribanes, the kings of Armenia and Hiberia, who were conciliated by the\r\ngift of magnificent and honourable robes and by presents of all kinds,\r\nand who could have done great harm to the Roman interests if at such a\r\ncrisis they had gone over to the Persians.\r\n\r\n9. At this important time, Hermogenes died, and was succeeded in his\r\nprefecture by Helpidius, a native of Paphlagonia, a man of mean\r\nappearance and no eloquence, but of a frank and truthful disposition,\r\nhumane and merciful. So much so that once when Constantius ordered an\r\ninnocent man to be put to the torture before him, he calmly requested to\r\nbe deprived of his office, and that such commissions might be given to\r\nothers who would discharge them in a manner more in accordance with the\r\nemperor's sentence.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. Constantius was perplexed at the danger of the crisis before him,\r\nand doubted what to do, being for some time in deep anxiety whether to\r\nmarch against Julian, who was still at a distance, or to drive back the\r\nPersians, who were already threatening to cross the Euphrates. And while\r\nhe was hesitating, and often taking counsel with his generals, he at\r\nlast decided that he would first finish, or at all events take the edge\r\noff, the war which was nearest, so as to leave nothing formidable behind\r\nhim, and then penetrate through Illyricum and Italy, thinking to catch\r\nJulian at the very outset of his enterprise, as he might catch a deer\r\nwith hounds. For so he used to boast, to appease the fears of those\r\nabout him.\r\n\r\n2. But that his purpose might not appear to cool, and that he might not\r\nseem to have neglected any side of the war, he spread formidable rumours\r\nof his approach in every direction. And fearing that Africa, which on\r\nall occasions seemed to invite usurpers, might be invaded during his\r\nabsence, as if he had already quitted the eastern frontier, he sent by\r\nsea to that country his secretary Gaudentius, whom we have already\r\nmentioned as a spy upon the actions of Julian in Gaul.\r\n\r\n3. He had two reasons for thinking that this man would be able with\r\nprompt obedience to do all that he desired, both because he feared the\r\nother side, which he had offended, and also because he was anxious to\r\ntake this opportunity to gain the favour of Constantius, whom he\r\nexpected beyond a doubt to see victorious. Indeed no one at that time\r\nhad any other opinion.\r\n\r\n4. When Gaudentius arrived in Africa, recollecting the emperor's orders,\r\nhe sent letters to Count Cretio, and to the other officers, to instruct\r\nthem what his object was; and having collected a formidable force from\r\nall quarters, and having brought over a light division of skirmishers\r\nfrom the two Mauritanias, he watched the coasts opposite to Italy and\r\nGaul with great strictness.\r\n\r\n5. Nor was Constantius deceived in the wisdom of this measure. For as\r\nlong as Gaudentius lived none of the adverse party ever reached that\r\ncountry, although a vast multitude in arms was watching the Sicilian\r\ncoast between Cape Boeo and Cape Passaro, and ready to cross in a moment\r\nif they could find an opportunity.\r\n\r\n6. Having made these arrangements as well as the case admitted, in such\r\na way as he thought most for his advantage and having settled other\r\nthings also of smaller importance, Constantius was warned by messengers\r\nand letters from his generals that the Persian army, in one solid body,\r\nand led by its haughty king, was now marching close to the banks of the\r\nTigris, though it was as yet uncertain at what point they meant to cross\r\nthe frontier.\r\n\r\n7. And he, feeling the importance of this intelligence, in order, by\r\nbeing near them, to anticipate their intended enterprises, quitted his\r\nwinter quarters in haste, having called in the infantry and cavalry on\r\nwhich he could rely from all quarters, crossed the Euphrates by a bridge\r\nof boats at Capessana, and marched towards Edessa, which was well\r\nprovisioned and strongly fortified, intending to wait there a short time\r\ntill he could receive from spies or deserters certain information of the\r\nenemy's motions.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. In the mean time, Julian leaving the district of Basle, and having\r\ntaken all the steps which we have already mentioned, sent Sallustius,\r\nwhom he had promoted to be a prefect, into Gaul, and appointed\r\nGermanianus to succeed Nebridius. At the same time he gave Nevitta the\r\ncommand of the heavy cavalry, being afraid of the old traitor\r\nGumoharius, who, when he was commander of the Scutarii, he heard had\r\nsecretly betrayed his chief officer, Vetranio. The quæstorship he gave\r\nto Jovius, of whom we have spoken when relating the acts of Magnentius,\r\nand the treasury he allotted to Mamertinus. Dagalaiphus also was made\r\ncaptain of the household guard, and many others, with whose merits and\r\nfidelity he was acquainted, received different commands at his\r\ndiscretion.\r\n\r\n2. Being now about to march through the Black Forest, and the country\r\nlying on the banks of the Danube, he on a sudden conceived great doubt\r\nand fear whether the smallness of his force might not breed contempt,\r\nand encourage the numerous population of the district to resist his\r\nadvance.\r\n\r\n3. To prevent this, he took prudent precautions, and distributing his\r\narmy into divisions, he sent some under Jovenius and Jovius to advance\r\nwith all speed by the well-trodden roads of Italy; others under the\r\ncommand of Nevitta, the commander of the cavalry, were to take the\r\ninland road of the Tyrol. So that his army, by being scattered over\r\nvarious countries, might cause a belief that its numbers were immense,\r\nand might fill all nations with fear. Alexander the Great, and many\r\nother skilful generals, had done the same thing when their affairs\r\nrequired it.\r\n\r\n4. But he charged them, when they set forth, to march with all speed, as\r\nif likely to meet at any moment with an enemy, and carefully to post\r\nwatches and sentries and outposts at night, so as to be free from the\r\ndanger of any sudden attack.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\n§ 1. These things having been arranged according to the best of his\r\njudgment, Julian adhering to the maxim by which he had often forced his\r\nway through the countries of the barbarians, and trusting in his\r\ncontinued successes, proceeded in his advance.\r\n\r\n2. And when he had reached the spot at which he had been informed that\r\nthe river was navigable, he embarked on board some boats which good\r\nfortune had brought thither in numbers, and passed as secretly as he\r\ncould down the stream, escaping notice the more because his habits of\r\nendurance and fortitude had made him indifferent to delicate food; so\r\nthat, being contented with meagre and poor fare, he did not care to\r\napproach their towns or camps, forming his conduct in this respect\r\naccording to the celebrated saying of the ancient Cyrus, who, when he\r\nwas introduced to a host who asked him what he wished to have got ready\r\nfor supper, answered, \"Nothing beyond bread, for that he hoped he should\r\nsup by the side of a river.\"\r\n\r\n3. But Fame, which, as they say, having a thousand tongues, always\r\nexaggerates the truth, at this time spread abroad a report among all the\r\ntribes of Illyricum that Julian, having overthrown a number of kings and\r\nnations in Gaul, was coming on flushed with success and with a numerous\r\narmy.\r\n\r\n4. Jovinus, the prefect of the prætorium, being alarmed at this rumour,\r\nfled in haste, as if from a foreign enemy; and going by the public\r\nconveyances with frequent relays, he crossed the Julian Alps, taking\r\nwith him also Florentius the prefect.\r\n\r\n5. But Count Lucillianus, who at that time had the command of the army\r\nin these districts, being at Sirmium, and having received some slight\r\nintelligence of Julian's movements, collected the soldiers whom the\r\nemergency gave time for being quickly called from their several\r\nstations, and proposed to resist his advance.\r\n\r\n6. Julian, however, like a firebrand or torch once kindled, hastened\r\nquickly to his object; and when, at the waning of the moon, he had\r\nreached Bonmunster, which is about nineteen miles from Sirmium,[116] and\r\nwhen, therefore, the main part of the night was dark, he unexpectedly\r\nquitted his boats, and at once sent forward Dagalaiphus with his light\r\ntroops to summon Lucillianus to his presence, and to drag him before him\r\nif he resisted.\r\n\r\n7. He was asleep, and when he was awakened by the violence of this\r\nuproar, and saw himself surrounded by a crowd of strangers, perceiving\r\nthe state of the case, and being filled with awe at the name of the\r\nemperor, he obeyed his orders, though sadly against his will. And though\r\ncommander of the cavalry, a little while before proud and fierce, he now\r\nobeyed the will of another, and mounting a horse which was brought him\r\non a sudden, he was led before Julian, as an ignoble prisoner, and from\r\nfear was hardly able to collect his senses.\r\n\r\n8. But as soon as he saw the emperor, and was relieved by receiving\r\npermission to offer his salutations to his purple robe, he recovered his\r\ncourage, and feeling safe said, \"You have been incautious and rash, O\r\nemperor, to trust yourself with but a few troops in the country of\r\nanother.\" But Julian, with a sarcastic smile, replied, \"Keep these\r\nprudent speeches for Constantius. I offered you the ensign of my royal\r\nrank to ease you of your fears, and not to take you for my counsellor.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\n§ 1. So after he had got rid of Lucillianus, thinking no further delay\r\nor hesitation admissible, being bold and confident in all emergencies,\r\nand on the way, as he presumed, to a city inclined to surrender, he\r\nmarched on with great speed. When he came near the suburbs, which are\r\nvery large and much extended, a vast crowd of soldiers and of every\r\nclass of the population came forth to meet him with lights and flowers\r\nand auspicious prayers, and after saluting him as emperor and lord,\r\nconducted him to the palace.\r\n\r\n2. He, pleased at these favourable omens, and conceiving therefrom a\r\nsanguine hope of future success, concluded that the example of so\r\npopulous and illustrious a metropolis would be followed as a\r\nguiding-star by other cities also, and therefore on the very next day\r\nexhibited a chariot race, to the great joy of the people. On the third\r\nday, unable to brook any delay, he proceeded by the public roads, and\r\nwithout any resistance seized upon Succi, and appointed Nevitta governor\r\nof the place, as one whom he could trust. It is fitting that I should\r\nnow explain the situation of this place Succi.\r\n\r\n3. The summits of the mountain chains of Hæmus[117] and Rhodope, the\r\nfirst of which rises up from the very banks of the Danube, and the other\r\nfrom the southern bank of the river Axius, ending with swelling ridges\r\nat one narrow point, separate the Illyrians and the Thracians, being on\r\nthe one side near the inland Dacians and Serdica, on the other looking\r\ntowards Thrace and the rich and noble city of Philippopolis. And, as if\r\nNature had provided for bringing the surrounding nations under the\r\ndominion of the Romans, they are of such a form as to lead to this end.\r\nAffording at first only a single exit through narrow defiles, but at a\r\nlater period they were opened out with roads of such size and beauty as\r\nto be passable even for waggons. Though still, when the passes have been\r\nblocked up, they have often repelled the attacks of great generals and\r\nmighty armies.\r\n\r\n4. The part which looks to Illyricum is of a more gentle ascent, so as\r\nto be climbed almost imperceptibly; but the side opposite to Thrace is\r\nvery steep and precipitous, in some places absolutely impassable, and in\r\nothers hard to climb even where no one seeks to prevent it. Beneath this\r\nlofty chain a spacious level plain extends in every direction, the upper\r\nportion of it reaching even to the Julian Alps, while the lower portion\r\nof it is so open and level as to present no obstacles all the way to the\r\nstraits and sea of Marmora.\r\n\r\n5. Having arranged these matters as well as the occasion permitted, and\r\nhaving left there the commander of the cavalry, the emperor returned to\r\nNissa, a considerable town, in order, without any hindrance, to settle\r\neverything in the way most suited to his interests.\r\n\r\n6. While there he appointed Victor, an historical writer, whom he had\r\nseen at Sirmium, and whom he ordered to follow him from that city, to be\r\nconsular governor of the second Pannonia; and he erected in his honour a\r\nbrazen statue, as a man to be imitated for his temperance; and some time\r\nafter he was appointed prefect of Rome.\r\n\r\n7. And now, giving the rein to loftier ideas, and believing it to be\r\nimpossible to bring Constantius to terms, he wrote a speech full of\r\nbitter invectives to the senate, setting forth many charges of disgrace\r\nand vice against him. And when this harangue, Tertullus still being\r\nprefect of the city, was read in the senate, the gratitude of the\r\nnobles, as well as their splendid boldness, was very conspicuous; for\r\nthey all cried out with one unanimous feeling, \"We expect that you\r\nshould show reverence to the author of your own greatness.\"\r\n\r\n8. Then he assailed the memory of Constantine also as an innovator and a\r\ndisturber of established laws and of customs received from ancient\r\ntimes, accusing him of having been the first to promote barbarians to\r\nthe fasces and robe of the consul. But in this respect he spoke with\r\nfolly and levity, since, in the face of what he so bitterly reproved, he\r\na very short time afterwards added to Mamertinus, as his colleague in\r\nthe consulship, Nevitta, a man neither in rank, experience, or\r\nreputation at all equal to those on whom Constantine had conferred that\r\nillustrious magistracy, but who, on the contrary, was destitute of\r\naccomplishments and somewhat rude; and what was less easy to be endured,\r\nmade a cruel use of his high power.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\n§ 1. While Julian was occupied with these and similar thoughts, and was\r\nanxious about great and important affairs, a messenger came with\r\nterrible and unexpected news of the monstrous attempts of some persons\r\nwhich were likely to hinder his fiery progress, unless by prompt\r\nvigilance he could crush them, before they came to a head. I will\r\nbriefly relate what they were.\r\n\r\n2. Under pretence of urgent necessity, but in reality because he still\r\nsuspected their fidelity to him, he had sent into Gaul two legions\r\nbelonging to the army of Constantius, with a troop of archers which he\r\nhad found at Sirmium. They, moving slowly, and dreading the length of\r\nthe journey and the fierce and continual attacks of the hostile Germans,\r\nplanned a mutiny, being prompted and encouraged by Nigrinus, a tribune\r\nof a squadron of cavalry, a native of Mesopotamia. And having arranged\r\nthe matter in secret conferences, and kept it close in profound silence,\r\nwhen they arrived at Aquileia, a city important from its situation and\r\nwealth, and fortified with strong walls, they suddenly closed the gates\r\nin a hostile manner, the native population, by whom the name of\r\nConstantius was still beloved, increasing the confusion and the terror.\r\nAnd having blockaded all the approaches, and armed the towers and\r\nbattlements, they prepared measures to encounter the impending struggle,\r\nbeing in the mean time free and unrestrained. By this daring conduct\r\nthey roused the Italian natives of the district to espouse the side of\r\nConstantius, who was still alive.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. When Julian heard of this transaction, being then at Nissa, as he\r\nfeared nothing unfriendly in his rear, and had read and heard that this\r\ncity, though often besieged, had never been destroyed or taken,\r\nhastened the more eagerly to gain it, either by stratagem, or by some\r\nkind of flattery or other, before any more formidable event should\r\narise.\r\n\r\n2. Therefore he ordered Jovinus, the captain of his cavalry, who was\r\nmarching over the Alps, and had entered Noricum, to return with all\r\nspeed, to remedy by some means or other, the evil which had burst out.\r\nAnd, that nothing might be wanting, he bade him retain all the soldiers\r\nwho were marching after his court or his standards and passing through\r\nthat town, and to avail himself of their help to the utmost.\r\n\r\n3. When he had made these arrangements, having soon afterwards heard of\r\nthe death of Constantius, he crossed through Thrace, and entered\r\nConstantinople: and having been often assured that the siege would be\r\nprotracted rather than formidable, he sent Immo with some other counts\r\nto conduct it; and removed Jovinus to employ him in other matters of\r\ngreater importance.\r\n\r\n4. Therefore, having surrounded Aquileia with a double line of heavy\r\ninfantry, the generals all agreed upon trying to induce the garrison to\r\nsurrender, using alternately threats and caresses; but after many\r\nproposals and replies had been interchanged, their obstinacy only\r\nincreased, and the conferences were abandoned, having proved wholly\r\nineffectual.\r\n\r\n5. And because there was now no prospect but that of a battle, both\r\nsides refreshed themselves with sleep and food; and at daybreak the\r\ntrumpets sounded, and the two armies, arrayed for reciprocal slaughter,\r\nattacked one another with loud shouts, but with more ferocity than\r\nskill.\r\n\r\n6. Therefore the besiegers, bearing wooden penthouses over them, and\r\nclosely woven wicker defences, marched on slowly and cautiously, and\r\nattempted to undermine the walls with iron tools: many also bore ladders\r\nwhich had been made of the height of the walls, and came up close to\r\nthem: when some were dashed down by stones hurled on their heads, others\r\nwere transfixed by whizzing javelins, and falling back, dragged with\r\nthem those who were in their rear; and others, from fear of similar\r\nmischances, shrank from the attack.\r\n\r\n7. The besieged being encouraged by the issue of this first conflict,\r\nand hoping for still better success, disregarded the rest of the attacks\r\nmade on them; and with resolute minds they stationed engines in suitable\r\npositions, and with unwearied toil discharged the duties of watching and\r\nof whatever else could tend to their safety.\r\n\r\n8. On the other hand, the besiegers, though fearing another combat, and\r\nfull of anxiety, still out of shame would not appear lazy or cowardly,\r\nand as they could make no way by open attacks, they also applied\r\nthemselves to the various manoeuvres employed in sieges. And because\r\nthere was no ground favourable for working battering-rams or other\r\nengines, nor for making mines, since the river Natiso passed under the\r\nwalls of the city, they contrived a plan worthy to be compared with any\r\neffort of ancient skill.\r\n\r\n9. With great rapidity they built some wooden towers, higher than the\r\nbattlements of the enemy, and then fastening their boats together, they\r\nplaced these towers on them. In them they stationed soldiers, who, with\r\nundaunted resolution, laboured to drive down the garrison from the\r\nwalls; while under them were bodies of light infantry wholly\r\nunencumbered, who going forth from the hollow parts of the towers below,\r\nthrew drawbridges across, which they had put together beforehand, and so\r\ntried to cross over to the bottom of the wall while the attention of the\r\ngarrison was diverted from them; so that while those above them were\r\nattacking one another with darts and stones, those who crossed over on\r\nthe drawbridges might be able without interruption to break down a\r\nportion of the wall and so effect an entrance.\r\n\r\n10. But once more a clever design failed in its result. For when the\r\ntowers came close to the walls, they were assailed with brands steeped\r\nin pitch, and reeds, and faggots, and every kind of food for flames, all\r\nkindled. The towers quickly caught fire, and yielding under the weight\r\nof the men who were mounted on them, fell into the river, while some of\r\nthe soldiers on their summits, even before they fell, had been pierced\r\nwith javelins hurled from the engines on the walls, and so died.\r\n\r\n11. Meanwhile the soldiers at the foot of the wall, being cut off by the\r\ndestruction of their comrades in the boats, were crushed with huge\r\nstones, with the exception of a few, who, in spite of the difficult\r\nground over which their flight lay, escaped by their swiftness of foot.\r\nAt last, when the contest had been protracted till evening, the usual\r\nsignal for retreat was given, and the combatants parted to pass the\r\nnight with very different feelings.\r\n\r\n12. The losses of the besiegers, who had suffered greatly, encouraged\r\nthe defenders of the town with hopes of victory, though they also had to\r\nmourn the deaths of some few of their number. Nevertheless, the\r\npreparations went on rapidly. Rest and food refreshed their bodies\r\nduring the night; and at dawn of day the conflict was renewed at the\r\ntrumpet's signal.\r\n\r\n13. Some, holding their shields over their heads, in order to fight with\r\nmore activity; others, in front, bore ladders on their shoulders, and\r\nrushed on with eager vehemence, exposing their breasts to wounds from\r\nevery kind of weapon. Some endeavoured to break down the iron bars of\r\nthe gates; but were attacked with fire, or crushed under stones hurled\r\nfrom the walls. Some boldly strove to cross the fosses, but fell beneath\r\nthe sudden sallies of soldiers rushing out from postern gates, or were\r\ndriven back with severe wounds. For those who sallied forth had an easy\r\nretreat within the walls, and the rampart in front of the walls,\r\nstrengthened with turf, saved those who lay in wait behind it from all\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\n14. Although the garrison excelled in endurance and in the arts of war,\r\nwithout any other aid than that of their walls, still our soldiers,\r\nbeing attacked as they were from a more numerous force, became impatient\r\nof the long delay, and moved round and round the suburbs, seeking\r\ndiligently to discover by what force or what engines they could make\r\ntheir way out of the city.\r\n\r\n15. But as, through the greatness of the difficulties in their way, they\r\ncould not accomplish this, they began to slacken their exertions as to\r\nthe siege itself, and leaving a few watches and outposts, ravaged the\r\nadjacent country, and thus obtained all kinds of supplies, dividing\r\ntheir booty with their comrades. The consequence was, that excessive\r\neating and drinking proved injurious to their health.\r\n\r\n16. When, however, Immo and his colleagues reported this to Julian, who\r\nwas passing the winter at Constantinople, he applied a wise remedy to\r\nsuch a disorder, and sent thither Agilo, the commander of his infantry,\r\nan officer in great esteem, that when a man of his rank and reputation\r\nappeared there and took the intelligence of the death of Constantius to\r\nthe army, the siege might be terminated in that way.\r\n\r\n17. In the mean while, not to abandon the siege of Aquileia, as all\r\nother attempts had proved futile, the generals endeavoured to compel the\r\ncitizens to surrender by want of water. So they cut the aqueducts; but\r\nas the garrison still resisted with undiminished courage, they, with\r\nvast valour, diverted the stream of the river. But this again was done\r\nin vain; for they reduced the allowance of water to each man; and\r\ncontented themselves with the scanty supply they could procure from\r\nwells.\r\n\r\n18. While these affairs were proceeding thus, Agilo arrived, as he had\r\nbeen commanded; and, being protected by a strong body of heavy infantry,\r\ncame up boldly close to the walls; and in a long and veracious speech,\r\ntold the citizens of the death of Constantius, and the confirmation of\r\nJulian's power; but was reviled and treated as a liar. Nor would any one\r\nbelieve his statement of what had occurred, till on promise of safety he\r\nwas admitted by himself to the edge of the defences; where, with a\r\nsolemn oath, he repeated what he had before related.\r\n\r\n19. When his story was heard, they all, eager to be released from their\r\nprotracted sufferings, threw open the gates and rushed out, admitting\r\nhim in the joy as a captain who brought them peace; and excusing\r\nthemselves, they gave up Nigrinus as the author of their mad resistance,\r\nand a few others; demanding that their punishment should be taken as an\r\natonement for the treason and sufferings of the city.\r\n\r\n20. Accordingly, a few days later, the affair was rigorously\r\ninvestigated; Mamertinus, the prefect of the prætorium, sitting as\r\njudge; and Nigrinus, as the cause of the war, was burnt alive. After\r\nhim, Romulus and Sabostius, men who had held high office, being\r\nconvicted of having sown discord in the empire without any regard to the\r\nconsequences, were beheaded; and all the rest escaped unpunished, as\r\nmen who had been driven to hostilities by necessity, and not by their\r\nown inclination; this being the decision of the merciful and clement\r\nemperor, after a full consideration of justice. These things, however,\r\nhappened some time afterwards.\r\n\r\n21. But Julian, who was still at Nissa, was occupied in the graver\r\ncases, being full of fears on both sides. For he was apprehensive lest\r\nthe defiles of the Julian Alps might be seized and barred against him by\r\nsome sudden onset of the troops who had been shut up in Aquileia; by\r\nwhich he might lose the provinces beyond, and the supplies which he was\r\ndaily expecting from that quarter.\r\n\r\n22. And he also greatly feared the power of the East; hearing that the\r\nsoldiers who were scattered over Thrace had been suddenly collected\r\ntogether to act against him, and were advancing towards the frontiers of\r\nthe Succi, under command of Count Marcianus. But, devising measures\r\nsuitable to this mass of pressing anxieties, he quickly assembled his\r\nIllyrian army, long inured to war, and eager to renew its martial\r\nlabours under a warlike chief.\r\n\r\n23. Nor even at this critical moment did he forget the interests of\r\nindividuals; but devoted some time to hearing contested causes,\r\nespecially those concerning municipal bodies, in whose favour he was too\r\npartial, so that he raised several persons who did not deserve such\r\nhonour to public offices.\r\n\r\n24. It was here that he found Symmachus and Maximus, two eminent\r\nsenators, who had been sent by the nobles as envoys to Constantius, and\r\nhad returned again. He promoted them with great honour; so that,\r\npreferring them to others more deserving, he made Maximus prefect of the\r\neternal city, in order to gratify Rufinus Vulcatius, whose nephew he\r\nwas. Under his administration the city enjoyed great plenty, and there\r\nwas an end to the complaints of the common people, which had been so\r\nfrequent.\r\n\r\n25. Afterwards, in order to add security to those of his affairs which\r\nwere still unsettled, and encourage the confidence of the loyal, he\r\nraised Mamertinus, the prefect of the prætorium in Illyricum, and\r\nNevitta to the consulship; though he had so lately assailed the memory\r\nof Constantine as the person who had set the example of thus promoting\r\nlow-born barbarians.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. While Julian was thus carrying out new projects, and alternating\r\nbetween hope and fear, Constantius at Edessa, being made anxious by the\r\nvarious accounts brought him by his spies, was full of perplexity. At\r\none time collecting his army for battle; at another, wishing to lay\r\nsiege to Bezabde on two sides, if he could find an opportunity; taking\r\nat the same time prudent precautions not to leave Mesopotamia\r\nunprotected, while about to march into the districts of Armenia.\r\n\r\n2. But while still undecided, he was detained by various causes. Sapor\r\nalso remained on the other side of the Tigris till the sacrifices should\r\nbecome propitious to his moving. For if after crossing the river he\r\nfound no resistance, he might without difficulty penetrate to the\r\nEuphrates. On the other hand, if he wished to keep his soldiers for the\r\ncivil war, he feared to expose them to the dangers of a siege; having\r\nalready experienced the strength of the walls and the vigour of the\r\ngarrison.\r\n\r\n3. However, not to lose time, and to avoid inactivity, he sent Arbetio\r\nand Agilo, the captains of his infantry and cavalry, with very large\r\nforces, to march with all speed; not to provoke the Persians to battle,\r\nbut to establish forts on the nearest bank of the Tigris, which might be\r\nable to reconnoitre, and see in what direction the furious monarch broke\r\nforth; and with many counsels given both verbally and in writing, he\r\ncharged them to retreat with celerity the moment the enemy's army began\r\nto cross the river.\r\n\r\n4. While these generals were watching the frontier as they were ordered,\r\nand spying out the secret designs of their most crafty enemy, he\r\nhimself, with the main body of his army, made head against his most\r\npressing foes, as if prepared for battle; and defended the adjacent\r\ntowns by rapid movements. Meantime spies and deserters continually\r\ncoming in, related to him opposite stories; being in fact ignorant of\r\nwhat was intended, because among the Persians no one knows what is\r\ndecided on except a few taciturn and trusty nobles, by whom the god\r\nSilence is worshipped.\r\n\r\n5. But the emperor was continually sent for by the generals whom I have\r\nmentioned, who implored him to send them aid. For they protested that\r\nunless the whole strength of the army was collected together, it would\r\nbe impossible to withstand the onset of the furious Sapor.\r\n\r\n6. And while things in this quarter were thus full of anxiety, other\r\nmessengers arrived in numbers, by whose accurate statements he learnt\r\nthat Julian had traversed Italy and Illyricum with great rapidity, had\r\noccupied the defiles of the Succi, and called in auxiliaries from all\r\nquarters, and was now marching through Thrace with a very large force.\r\n\r\n7. Constantius, learning this, was overwhelmed with grief, but supported\r\nby one comfort, that he had always triumphed over internal commotions.\r\nNevertheless, though the affair made it very difficult for him to decide\r\non a line of action, he chose the best; and sent a body of troops on by\r\npublic conveyances, in order as quickly as possible to make head against\r\nthe impending danger.\r\n\r\n8. And as that plan was universally approved, the troops went as they\r\nwere commanded, in the lightest marching order. But the next day, while\r\nhe was finally arranging these matters, he received intelligence that\r\nSapor, with his whole army, had returned to his own country, because the\r\nauspices were unfavourable. So, his fears being removed, he called in\r\nall the troops except those who as usual were assigned for the\r\nprotection of Mesopotamia, and returned to Hierapolis.\r\n\r\n9. And still doubting what would be the final result of all his\r\ndifficulties, when he had collected his army together he convened all\r\nthe centuries and companies and squadrons by sound of trumpet; and the\r\nwhole plain being filled with the host, he, standing on a lofty tribune,\r\nin order to encourage them the more readily to execute what he should\r\ndirect, and being surrounded by a numerous retinue, spoke thus with\r\ngreat appearance of calmness and a studied look of confidence.\r\n\r\n10. \"Being always anxious never to do or say anything inconsistent with\r\nincorruptible honour, like a cautious pilot, who turns his helm this way\r\nor that way according to the movement of the waves, I am now\r\nconstrained, my most affectionate subjects, to confess my errors to you,\r\nor rather, if I were to say the plain truth, my humanity, which I did\r\nthink would be beneficial to our common interests. So now that you may\r\nthe better understand what is the object of convoking this assembly,\r\nlisten, I pray you, with impartiality and kindness.\r\n\r\n11. \"At the time when Magnentius, whom your bravery overcome, was\r\nobstinately labouring to throw all things into confusion, I sent Gallus\r\nmy cousin, who had been lately raised to the rank of Cæsar, to guard the\r\nEast. But he, having by many wicked and shameful arts departed from\r\njustice, was punished by a legal sentence.\r\n\r\n12. \"Would that Envy had then been contented, that most bitter exciter\r\nof troubles! And that we had nothing to grieve us but the single\r\nrecollection of past sorrows, unaccompanied by any idea of present\r\ndanger! But now a new circumstance, more grievous than any former one I\r\nwill venture to say, has taken place, which the gods who aid us will put\r\nan end to by means of your innate valour.\r\n\r\n13. \"Julian, whom, while you were combating the nations which threaten\r\nIllyricum on all sides, I appointed to protect Gaul, presuming on the\r\nissue of some trifling battles which he has fought against the\r\nhalf-armed Germans, and full of silly elation, has taken a few auxiliary\r\nbattalions into his noble alliance, men from their natural ferocity and\r\nthe desperateness of their situation ready for acts of the most\r\nmischievous audacity, and has conspired against the public safety,\r\ntrampling down justice, the parent and nurse of the Roman world. That\r\npower I believe, both because I myself have experienced it, and because\r\nall antiquity assures me of its might, will, as an avenger of\r\nwickedness, soon trample down their pride like so many ashes.\r\n\r\n14. \"What then remains, except to hasten to encounter the whirlwind thus\r\nraised against us? so as by promptitude to crush the fury of this rising\r\nwar before it comes to maturity and strength? Nor can it be questioned\r\nthat, with the favour of the supreme deity, by whose everlasting\r\nsentence ungrateful men are condemned, the sword which they have\r\nwickedly drawn will be turned to their own destruction. Since never\r\nhaving received any provocation, but rather after having been loaded\r\nwith benefits, they have risen up to threaten innocent men with danger.\r\n\r\n15. \"For as my mind augurs, and as justice, which will aid upright\r\ncounsels, promises, I feel sure that when once we come to close\r\nquarters, they will be so benumbed with fear as neither to be able to\r\nstand the fire of your glancing eyes nor the sound of your battle cry.\"\r\nThis speech harmonized well with the feelings of the soldiers. In their\r\nrage they brandished their shields, and after answering him in terms of\r\neager good-will, demanded to be led at once against the rebels. Their\r\ncordiality changed the emperor's fear into joy; and having dismissed the\r\nassembly, as he knew by past experience that Arbetio was most eminently\r\nsuccessful in putting an end to intestine wars, he ordered him to\r\nadvance first by the road which he himself designed to take, with the\r\nspearmen and the legion of Mattium,[118] and several battalions of light\r\ntroops; he also ordered Gomoarius to take with him the Leti, to check\r\nthe enemy on their arrival among the defiles of the Succi; he was\r\nselected for this service because he was unfriendly to Julian on account\r\nof some slight he had received from him in Gaul.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\n§ 1. While the fortune of Constantius was now wavering and tottering in\r\nthis tumult of adverse circumstances, it showed plainly by signs which\r\nalmost spoke that a very critical moment of his life was at hand. For he\r\nwas terrified by nocturnal visions, and before he was thoroughly asleep\r\nhe had seen the shade of his father bringing him a beautiful child; and\r\nwhen he received it and placed it in his bosom, it struck a globe which\r\nhe had in his right hand to a distance. Now this indicated a change of\r\ncircumstances, although those who interpreted it gave favourable answers\r\nwhen consulted.\r\n\r\n2. After this he confessed to his most intimate friends that, as if he\r\nwere wholly forsaken, he had ceased to see a secret vision which\r\nsometimes he had fancied appeared to him in mournful guise; and he\r\nbelieved that the genius who had been appointed to watch over his safety\r\nhad abandoned him, as one who was soon to leave the world.\r\n\r\n3. For the opinion of theologians is, that all men when they are born\r\n(without prejudice to the power of destiny) are connected with a\r\nsuperior power of this kind, who, as it were, guides their actions; but\r\nwho is seen by very few, and only by those who are endued with great and\r\nvarious virtues.\r\n\r\n4. This may be collected both from oracles and from eminent writers.\r\nAmong whom is the comic poet Menander, in whose works these two verses\r\nare found:--\r\n\r\n  \"A spirit is assigned to every man\r\n  When born to guide him in the path of life.\"\r\n\r\n5. It may also be gathered from the immortal poetry of Homer, that they\r\nwere not really the gods of heaven who conversed with his heroes, or\r\nstood by them and aided them in their combats; but the familiar genii\r\nwho belonged to them; to whom also, as their principal support,\r\nPythagoras owes his eminence, and Socrates and Numa Pompilius and the\r\nelder Scipio. And, as some fancy, Marius, and Octavianus the first, who\r\ntook the name of Augustus. And Hermes Trismegistus, and Apollonius of\r\nTyana, and Plotinus, who ventured upon some very mystical discussions of\r\nthis point; and endeavoured to show by profound reasoning what is the\r\noriginal cause why these genii, being thus connected with the souls of\r\nmortals, protect them as if they had been nursed in their own bosoms, as\r\nfar as they are permitted; and, if they find them pure, preserving the\r\nbody untainted by any connection with vice, and free from all taint of\r\nsin, instruct them in loftier mysteries.\r\n\r\n\r\nXV.\r\n\r\n§ 1. Constantius therefore, having hastened to Antioch, according to his\r\nwont, at the first movement of a civil war which he was eager to\r\nencounter, as soon as he had made all his preparations, was in amazing\r\nhaste to march, though many of his court were so unwilling as even to\r\nproceed to murmurs. For no one dare openly to remonstrate or object to\r\nhis plan.\r\n\r\n2. He set forth towards the end of autumn; and when he reached the\r\nsuburb called Hippocephalus, which is about three miles from the town,\r\nas soon as it was daylight he saw on his right the corpse of a man who\r\nhad been murdered, lying with his head torn off from the body, stretched\r\nout towards the west--and though alarmed at the omen, which seemed as if\r\nthe Fates were preparing his end, he went on more resolutely, and came\r\nto Tarsus, where he caught a slight fever; and thinking that the motion\r\nof his journey would remove the distemper, he went on by bad roads;\r\ndirecting his course by Mopsucrenæ, the farthest station in Cilicia for\r\nthose who travel from hence, at the foot of Mount Taurus.\r\n\r\n3. But when he attempted to proceed the next day he was prevented by the\r\nincreasing violence of his disorder, and the fever began gradually to\r\ninflame his veins, so that his body felt like a little fire, and could\r\nscarcely be touched; and as all remedies failed, he began in the last\r\nextremity to bewail his death; and while his mental faculties were still\r\nentire, he is said to have indicated Julian as the successor to his\r\npower. Presently the last struggle of death came on, and he lost the\r\npower of speech. And after long and painful agony he died on the fifth\r\nof October, having lived and reigned forty years and a few months.\r\n\r\n4. After bewailing his death with groans, lamentations, and mourning,\r\nthose of the highest rank in the royal palace deliberated what to do or\r\nto attempt; and having secretly consulted a few persons about the\r\nelection of an emperor, at the instigation, as it is said, of Eusebius,\r\nwho was stimulated by his consciousness of guilt (since Julian was\r\napproaching who was prepared to oppose his attempts at innovation), they\r\nsent Theolaiphus and Aligildus, who at that time were counts, to him, to\r\nannounce the death of his kinsman; and to entreat him to lay aside all\r\ndelay and hasten to take possession of the East, which was prepared to\r\nobey him.\r\n\r\n5. But fame and an uncertain report whispered that Constantius had left\r\na will, in which, as we have already mentioned, he had named Julian as\r\nhis heir; and had given commissions and legacies to his friends. But he\r\nleft his wife in the family way, who subsequently had a daughter, who\r\nreceived the same name, and was afterwards married to Gratianus.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI.\r\n\r\n§ 1. In accurately distinguishing the virtues and vices of Constantius,\r\nit will be well to take the virtues first. Always preserving the dignity\r\nof the imperial authority, he proudly and magnanimously disdained\r\npopularity. In conferring the higher dignities he was very sparing, and\r\nallowed very few changes to be made in the administration of the\r\nfinances. Nor did he ever encourage the arrogance of the soldiers.\r\n\r\n2. Nor under him was any general promoted to the title of most\r\nillustrious.[119] For there was also, as we have already mentioned, the\r\ntitle of most perfect.[120] Nor had the governor of a province occasion\r\nto court a commander of cavalry; as Constantius never allowed those\r\nofficers to meddle with civil affairs. But all officers, both military\r\nand civil, were according to the respectful usages of old, inferior to\r\nthat of the prefect of the prætorium, which was the most honourable of\r\nall.\r\n\r\n3. In taking care of the soldiers he was very cautious: an examiner into\r\ntheir merits, sometimes over-scrupulous, giving dignities about the\r\npalace as if with scales. Under him no one who was not well known to\r\nhim, or who was favoured merely by some sudden impulse, ever received\r\nany high appointment in the palace. But only such as had served ten\r\nyears in some capacity or other could look for such appointments as\r\nmaster of the ceremonies or treasurer. The successful candidates could\r\nalways be known beforehand; and it very seldom happened that any\r\nmilitary officer was transferred to a civil office; while on the other\r\nhand none but veteran soldiers were appointed to command troops.\r\n\r\n4. He was a diligent cultivator of learning, but, as his blunted talent\r\nwas not suited to rhetoric, he devoted himself to versification; in\r\nwhich, however, he did nothing worth speaking of.\r\n\r\n5. In his way of life he was economical and temperate, and by moderation\r\nin eating and drinking he preserved such robust health that he was\r\nrarely ill, though when ill dangerously so. For repeated experience and\r\nproof has shown that this is the case with persons who avoid\r\nlicentiousness and luxury.\r\n\r\n6. He was contented with very little sleep, which he took when time and\r\nseason allowed; and throughout his long life he was so extremely chaste\r\nthat no suspicion was ever cast on him in this respect, though it is a\r\ncharge which, even when it can find no ground, malignity is apt to\r\nfasten on princes.\r\n\r\n7. In riding and throwing the javelin, in shooting with the bow, and in\r\nall the accomplishments of military exercises, he was admirably skilful.\r\nThat he never blew his nose in public, never spat, never was seen to\r\nchange countenance, and that he never in all his life ate any fruit I\r\npass over, as what has been often related before.\r\n\r\n8. Having now briefly enumerated his good qualities with which we have\r\nbeen able to become acquainted, let us now proceed to speak of his\r\nvices. In other respects he was equal to average princes, but if he had\r\nthe slightest reason (even if founded on wholly false information) for\r\nsuspecting any one of aiming at supreme power, he would at once\r\ninstitute the most rigorous inquiry, trampling down right and wrong\r\nalike, and outdo the cruelty of Caligula, Domitian, or Commodus, whose\r\nbarbarity he rivalled at the very beginning of his reign, when he\r\nshamefully put to death his own connections and relations.\r\n\r\n9. And his cruelty and morose suspicions, which were directed against\r\neverything of the kind, were a cruel addition to the sufferings of the\r\nunhappy persons who were accused of sedition or treason.\r\n\r\n10. And if anything of the kind got wind, he instituted investigations\r\nof a more terrible nature than the law sanctioned, appointing men of\r\nknown cruelty as judges in such cases; and in punishing offenders he\r\nendeavoured to protract their deaths as long as nature would allow,\r\nbeing in such cases more savage than even Gallienus. For he, though\r\nassailed by incessant and real plots of rebels, such as Aureolus,\r\nPosthumus, Ingenuus, and Valens who was surnamed the Thessalonian, and\r\nmany others, often mitigated the penalty of crimes liable to sentence of\r\ndeath; while Constantius caused facts which were really unquestionable\r\nto be looked upon as doubtful by the excessive inhumanity of his\r\ntortures.\r\n\r\n11. In such cases he had a mortal hatred of justice, even though his\r\ngreat object was to be accounted just and merciful: and as sparks flying\r\nfrom a dry wood, by a mere breath of wind are sometimes carried on with\r\nunrestrained course to the danger of the country villages around, so he\r\nalso from the most trivial causes kindled heaps of evils, being very\r\nunlike that wise emperor Marcus Aurelius, who, when Cassius in Syria\r\naspired to the supreme power, and when a bundle of letters which he had\r\nwritten to his accomplices, was taken with their bearer, and brought to\r\nhim, ordered them at once to be burned, while he was still in Illyricum,\r\nin order that he might not know who had plotted against him, and so\r\nagainst his will be obliged to consider some persons as his enemies.\r\n\r\n12. And, as some right-thinking people are of opinion, it was rather an\r\nindication of great virtue in Constantius to have quelled the empire\r\nwithout shedding more blood, than to have revenged himself with such\r\ncruelty.\r\n\r\n13. As Cicero also teaches us, when in one of his letters to Nepos he\r\naccuses Cæsar of cruelty, \"For,\" says he, \"felicity is nothing else but\r\nsuccess in what is honourable;\" or to define it in another way,\r\n\"Felicity is fortune assisting good counsels, and he who is not guided\r\nby such cannot be happy. Therefore in wicked and impious designs such as\r\nthose of Cæsar there could be no felicity; and in my judgment Camillus\r\nwhen in exile was happier than Manlius at the same time, even if Manlius\r\nhad been able to make himself king, as he wished.\"\r\n\r\n14. The same is the language of Heraclitus of Ephesus, when he remarks\r\nthat men of eminent capacity and virtue, through the caprice of fortune,\r\nhave often been overcome by men destitute of either talent or energy.\r\nBut that that glory is the best when power, existing with high rank,\r\nforces, as it were, its inclinations to be angry and cruel, and\r\noppressive under the yoke, and so erects a glorious trophy in the\r\ncitadel of its victorious mind.\r\n\r\n15. But as in his foreign wars this emperor was unsuccessful and\r\nunfortunate, on the other hand in his civil contests he was successful;\r\nand in all those domestic calamities he covered himself with the horrid\r\nblood of the enemies of the republic and of himself; and yielding to his\r\nelation at these triumphs in a way neither right nor usual, he erected\r\nat a vast expense triumphal arches in Gaul and the two Pannonias, to\r\nrecord his triumphs over his own provinces; engraving on them the titles\r\nof his exploits ... as long as they should last, to those who read the\r\ninscriptions.\r\n\r\n16. He was preposterously addicted to listening to his wives, and to the\r\nthin voices of his eunuchs, and some of his courtiers, who applauded all\r\nhis words, and watched everything he said, whether in approval or\r\ndisapproval, in order to agree with it.\r\n\r\n17. The misery of these times was further increased by the insatiable\r\ncovetousness of his tax-collectors, who brought him more odium than\r\nmoney; and to many persons this seemed the more intolerable, because he\r\nnever listened to any excuse, never took any measures for relief of the\r\nprovinces when oppressed by the multiplicity of taxes and imposts; and\r\nin addition to all this he was very apt to take back any exemptions\r\nwhich he had granted.\r\n\r\n18. He confused the Christian religion, which is plain and simple, with\r\nold women's superstitions; in investigating which he preferred\r\nperplexing himself to settling its questions with dignity, so that he\r\nexcited much dissension; which he further encouraged by diffuse wordy\r\nexplanations: he ruined the establishment of public conveyances by\r\ndevoting them to the service of crowds of priests, who went to and fro\r\nto different synods, as they call the meetings at which they endeavour\r\nto settle everything according to their own fancy.\r\n\r\n19. As to his personal appearance and stature, he was of a dark\r\ncomplexion with prominent eyes; of keen sight, soft hair, with his\r\ncheeks carefully shaved, and bright looking. From his waist to his neck\r\nhe was rather long, his legs were very short and crooked, which made him\r\na good leaper and runner.\r\n\r\n20. When the body of the deceased emperor had been laid out, and placed\r\nin a coffin, Jovianus, at that time the chief officer of the guard, was\r\nordered to attend it with royal pomp to Constantinople, to be buried\r\namong his relations.\r\n\r\n21. While he was proceeding on the vehicle which bore the remains,\r\nsamples of the military provisions were brought to him as an offering,\r\nas is usual in the case of princes; and the public animals were paraded\r\nbefore him; and a concourse of people came out to meet him as was usual;\r\nwhich, with other similar demonstrations, seemed to portend to Jovianus,\r\nas the superintendent of his funeral, the attainment of the empire, but\r\nan authority only curtailed and shadowy.\r\n\r\n\r\n[114] The Quinquennalia (games under which title had been previously\r\ninstituted in honour of Julius Cæsar and Augustus) were revived by Nero,\r\nA.D. 60, again fell into disuse, and were again revived by\r\nDomitian.--Cf. Tacit. An. xiv. 20.\r\n\r\n[115] V. infra, Leo xxvi. c. 8.\r\n\r\n[116] Sirmium was very near the existing town of Peterwaradin.\r\n\r\n[117] Now the Balkan.\r\n\r\n[118] It is believed that Mattium is the same as Marburg; it is not\r\nquite certain.\r\n\r\n[119] These and other titles, such as \"respectable\" (spectabiles),\r\n\"illustrious\" (egregrie, illustres), were invented by the emperors of\r\nthis century. They none of them appear to have conferred any substantive\r\npower.\r\n\r\n[120] This office had been first established by Augustus, who created\r\ntwo prefects of the prætorian cohorts, under whose command also all the\r\nsoldiers in Italy were placed. Commodus raised the number to three, and\r\nConstantine to four, whom (when he abolished the prætorian cohort), he\r\nmade, in fact, governors of provinces. There was one præfectus prætorio\r\nfor Gaul, one for Italy, one for Illyricum, and one for the East.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK XXII.\r\n\r\nARGUMENT.\r\n\r\n     I.

While the variable events of fortune were bringing to pass these\r\nevents in different parts of the world, Julian, amid the many plans\r\nwhich he was revolving while in Illyricum, was continually consulting\r\nthe entrails of victims and watching the flight of birds in his\r\neagerness to know the result of what was about to happen.\r\n\r\n2. Aprunculus Gallus, an orator and a man of skill as a soothsayer, who\r\nwas afterwards promoted to be governor of Narbonne, announced these\r\nresults to him, being taught beforehand by the inspection of a liver, as\r\nhe affirmed, which he had seen covered with a double skin. And while\r\nJulian was fearing that he was inventing stories to correspond with his\r\ndesires, and was on that account out of humour, he himself beheld a far\r\nmore favourable omen, which clearly predicted the death of Constantius.\r\nFor at the same moment that that prince died in Cilicia, the soldier\r\nwho, as he was going to mount his horse, had supported him with his\r\nright hand, fell down, on which Julian at once exclaimed, in the hearing\r\nof many persons, that he who had raised him to the summit had fallen.\r\n\r\n3. But he did not change his plans, but remained within the border of\r\nDacia, still being harassed with many fears. Nor did he think it prudent\r\nto trust to conjectures, which might perhaps turn out contrary to his\r\nexpectations.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. But while he was thus in suspense, the ambassadors, Theolaiphus and\r\nAligildus, who had been despatched to him to announce the death of\r\nConstantius, suddenly arrived, adding that that prince with his last\r\nwords had named him as his successor in his dignity.\r\n\r\n2. As soon as he learnt this, being delighted at his deliverance from\r\nthe turmoils of war and its consequent disorders, and fully relying on\r\nthe prophecies he had received, having besides often experienced the\r\nadvantages of celerity of action, he issued orders to march to Thrace.\r\nTherefore speedily advancing his standards, he passed over the high\r\nground occupied by the Succi, and marched towards the ancient city of\r\nEumolpias, now called Philippopolis, all his army following him with\r\nalacrity.\r\n\r\n3. For they now saw that the imperial power which they were on their way\r\nto seize, in the face of imminent danger, was in a measure beyond their\r\nhopes put into their hands by the course of nature. And as report is\r\nwont marvellously to exaggerate events, a rumour got abroad that Julian,\r\nformidable both by sea and land, had entered Heraclea, called also\r\nPerinthus, borne over its unresisting walls on the chariot of\r\nTriptolemus, which from its rapid movements the ancients, who loved\r\nfables, had stated to be drawn by flying serpents and dragons.\r\n\r\n4. When he arrived at Constantinople, people of every age and sex poured\r\nforth to meet him, as though he were some one dropped from heaven. On\r\nthe eleventh of December he was received with respectful duty by the\r\nsenate, and by the unanimous applause of the citizens, and was escorted\r\ninto the city by vast troops of soldiers and civilians, marshalled like\r\nan army, while all eyes were turned on him, not only with the gaze of\r\ncuriosity, but with great admiration.\r\n\r\n5. For it seemed to them like a dream, that a youth in the flower of his\r\nage, of slight body, but renowned for great exploits, after many\r\nvictories over barbarian kings and nations, having passed from city to\r\ncity with unparalleled speed, should now, by an accession of wealth and\r\npower as rapid as the spread of fire, have become the unresisted master\r\nof the world; and the will of God itself having given him the empire,\r\nshould thus have obtained it without any injury to the state.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. His first step was to give to Secundus Sallustius, whom he promoted\r\nto be prefect of the prætorium, being well assured of his loyalty, a\r\ncommission to conduct some important investigations, joining with him as\r\ncolleagues Mamertinus, Arbetio, Agilo, and Nevitta, and also Jovinus,\r\nwhom he had recently promoted to the command of the cavalry in\r\nIllyricum.\r\n\r\n2. They all went to Chalcedon, and in the presence of the chiefs and\r\ntribunes, the Jovian and Herculian legions, they tried several causes\r\nwith too much rigour, though there were some in which it was undeniable\r\nthat the accused were really guilty.\r\n\r\n3. They banished Palladius, the master of the ceremonies, to Britain,\r\nthough there was but a suspicion that he had prejudiced Constantius\r\nagainst Gallus, while he was master of the ceremonies under that prince\r\nas Cæsar.\r\n\r\n4. They banished Taurus, who had been prefect of the prætorium, to\r\nVercelli, who, to all persons capable of distinguishing between right\r\nand wrong, will appear very excusable in respect to the act for which he\r\nwas condemned. For his offence was only that, fearing a violent\r\ndisturbance which had arisen, he fled to the protection of his prince.\r\nAnd the treatment inflicted on him could not be read without great\r\nhorror, when the preamble of the public accusation began thus:--\"In the\r\nconsulship of Taurus and Florentius, Taurus being brought before the\r\ncriers ...\"\r\n\r\n5. Pentadius also was destined for a similar sentence; the charge\r\nagainst him being that, having been sent on a mission by Constantius, he\r\nhad made notes of the replies given by Gallus when he was examined on\r\nseveral subjects before he was put to death. But as he defended himself\r\nwith justice, he was at last discharged.\r\n\r\n6. With similar iniquity, Florentius, at that time master of the\r\nceremonies, the son of Nigridianus, was banished to Boæ, an island on\r\nthe coast of Dalmatia. The other Florentius, who had been prefect of the\r\nprætorium, and was then consul, being alarmed at the sudden change in\r\nthe aspect of affairs, in order to save himself from danger, hid\r\nhimself and his wife for some time, and never returned during Julian's\r\nlife; still he was, though absent, condemned to death.\r\n\r\n7. In the same way, Evagrius, the comptroller of the private demesnes of\r\nthe emperor, and Saturninus, late superintendent of the palace, and\r\nCyrinus, late secretary, were all banished. But Justice herself seems to\r\nhave mourned over the death of Ursulus, the treasurer, and to accuse\r\nJulian of ingratitude to him. For when, as Cæsar, he was sent to the\r\nwest, with the intent that he was to be kept in great poverty, and\r\nwithout any power of making presents to any of his soldiers, in order to\r\nmake them less inclined to favour any enterprise which he might\r\nconceive, this same Ursulus gave him letters to the superintendent of\r\nthe Gallic treasury, desiring him to give the Cæsar whatever he might\r\nrequire.\r\n\r\n8. After his death, Julian, feeling that he was exposed to general\r\nreproach and execration, thinking that an unpardonable crime could be\r\nexcused, affirmed that the man had been put to death without his being\r\naware of it, pretending that he had been massacred by the fury of the\r\nsoldiers, who recollected what he had said (as we mentioned before) when\r\nhe saw the destruction of Amida.\r\n\r\n9. And therefore it seemed to be through fear, or else from a want of\r\nunderstanding what was proper, that he appointed Arbetio, a man always\r\nvacillating and arrogant, to preside over these investigations, with\r\nothers of the chief officers of the legions present for the look of the\r\nthing, when he knew that he had been one of the chief enemies to his\r\nsafety, as was natural in one who had borne, a distinguished share in\r\nthe successes of the civil war.\r\n\r\n10. And though these transactions which I have mentioned vexed those who\r\nwished him well, those which came afterwards were carried out with a\r\nproper vigour and severity.\r\n\r\n11. It was only a deserved destiny which befel Apodemius, who had been\r\nthe chief steward, and whose cruel machinations with respect to the\r\ndeaths of Silvanus and Gallus we have already mentioned, and Paulus, the\r\nsecretary, surnamed \"The Chain,\" men who are never spoken of without\r\ngeneral horror, and who were now sentenced to be burnt alive.\r\n\r\n12. They also sentenced to death Eusebius, the chief chamberlain of\r\nConstantius, a man equally full of ambition and cruelty, who from the\r\nlowest rank had been raised so high as even almost to lord it over the\r\nemperor, and who had thus become wholly intolerable; and whom Nemesis,\r\nwho beholds all human affairs, having often, as the saying is, plucked\r\nhim by the ear, and warned to conduct himself with more moderation, now,\r\nin spite of his struggles, hurled headlong from his high position.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n§ 1. After this Julian directed his whole favour and affection to people\r\nof every description about the palace; not acting in this like a\r\nphilosopher anxious for the discovery of truth.\r\n\r\n2. For he might have been praised if he had retained a few who were\r\nmoderate in their disposition, and of proved honesty and respectability.\r\nWe must, indeed, confess that the greater part of them had nourished as\r\nit were such a seed-bed of all vices, which they spread abroad so as to\r\ninfect the whole republic with evil desires, and did even more injury by\r\ntheir example than by the impunity which they granted to crimes.\r\n\r\n3. Some of them had been fed on the spoils of temples, had smelt out\r\ngain on every occasion, and having raised themselves from the lowest\r\npoverty to vast riches, had set no bounds to their bribery, their\r\nplunder, or their extravagance, being at all times accustomed to seize\r\nwhat belonged to others.\r\n\r\n4. From which habit the beginnings of licentious life sprang up, with\r\nperjuries, contempt of public opinion, and an insane arrogance,\r\nsacrificing good faith to infamous gains.\r\n\r\n5. Among which vices, debauchery and unrestrained gluttony grew to a\r\nhead, and costly banquets superseded triumphs for victories. The common\r\nuse of silken robes prevailed, the textile arts were encouraged, and\r\nabove all was the anxious care about the kitchen. Vast spaces were\r\nsought out for ostentatious houses, so vast that if the consul\r\nCincinnatus had possessed as much land, he would have lost the glory of\r\npoverty after his dictatorship.\r\n\r\n6. To these shameful vices was added the loss of military discipline;\r\nthe soldier practised songs instead of his battle-cry, and a stone would\r\nno longer serve him for a bed, as formerly, but he wanted feathers and\r\nyielding mattresses, and goblets heavier than his sword, for he was now\r\nashamed to drink out of earthenware; and he required marble houses,\r\nthough it is recorded in ancient histories that a Spartan soldier was\r\nseverely punished for venturing to appear under a roof at all during a\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\n7. But now the soldier was fierce and rapacious towards his own\r\ncountrymen, but towards the enemy he was inactive and timid, by courting\r\ndifferent parties, and in times of peace he had acquired riches, and was\r\nnow a judge of gold and precious stones, in a manner wholly contrary to\r\nthe recollection of very recent times.\r\n\r\n8. For it is well known that when, in the time of the Cæsar Maximian,\r\nthe camp of the king of Persia was plundered; a common soldier, after\r\nfinding a Persian bag full of pearls, threw the gems away in ignorance\r\nof their value, and went away contented with the mere beauty of his bit\r\nof dressed leather.\r\n\r\n9. In those days it also happened that a barber who had been sent for to\r\ncut the emperor's hair, came handsomely dressed; and when Julian saw\r\nhim, he was amazed, and said, \"I did not send for a superintendent, but\r\nfor a barber.\" And when he was asked what he made by his business, he\r\nanswered that he every day made enough to keep twenty persons, and as\r\nmany horses, and also a large annual income, besides many sources of\r\naccidental gain.\r\n\r\n10. And Julian, angry at this, expelled all the men of this trade, and\r\nthe cooks, and all who made similar profits, as of no use to him,\r\ntelling them, however, to go where they pleased.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n§ 1. And although from his earliest childhood he was inclined to the\r\nworship of the gods,[121] and gradually, as he grew up, became more\r\nattached to it, yet he was influenced by many apprehensions which made\r\nhim act in things relating to that subject as secretly as he could.\r\n\r\n2. But when his fears were terminated, and he found himself at liberty\r\nto do what he pleased, he then showed his secret inclinations, and by\r\nplain and positive decrees ordered the temples to be opened, and victims\r\nto be brought to the altars for the worship of the gods.\r\n\r\n3. And in order to give more effect to his intentions, he ordered the\r\npriests of the different Christian sects, with the adherents of each\r\nsect, to be admitted into the palace, and in a constitutional spirit\r\nexpressed his wish that their dissensions being appeased, each without\r\nany hindrance might fearlessly follow the religion he preferred.\r\n\r\n4. He did this the more resolutely because, as long licence increased\r\ntheir dissensions, he thought he should never have to fear the unanimity\r\nof the common people, having found by experience that no wild beasts are\r\nso hostile to men as Christian sects in general are to one another. And\r\nhe often used to say, \"Listen to me, to whom the Allemanni and Franks\r\nhave listened;\" imitating in this an expression of the ancient emperor\r\nMarcus Aurelius. But he omitted to notice that there was a great\r\ndifference between himself and his predecessor.\r\n\r\n5. For when Marcus was passing through Palestine, on his road to Egypt,\r\nhe is said, when wearied by the dirt and rebellious spirit of the Jews,\r\nto have often exclaimed with sorrow, \"O Marcomanni, O Quadi, O\r\nSarmatians, I have at last found others worse than you!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n§ 1. About the same time many Egyptians, excited by various rumours,\r\narrived at Constantinople; a race given to controversy, and extremely\r\naddicted to habits of litigation, covetous, and apt to ask payment of\r\ndebts due to them over and over again; and also, by way of escaping from\r\nmaking the payments due to them, to accuse the rich of embezzlement, and\r\nthe tax-gatherers of extortion.\r\n\r\n2. These men, collecting into one body, came screeching like so many\r\njackdaws, claiming in a rude manner the attention of the emperor\r\nhimself, and of the prefects of the prætorium, and demanding the\r\nrestoration of the contributions which they had been compelled to\r\nfurnish, justly or unjustly, for the last seventy years.\r\n\r\n3. And as they hindered the transaction of any other business, Julian\r\nissued an edict in which he ordered them all to go to Chalcedon,\r\npromising that he himself also would soon come there, and settle all\r\ntheir business.\r\n\r\n4. And when they had gone, an order was given to all the captains of\r\nships which go to and fro, that none of them should venture to take an\r\nEgyptian for a passenger. And as this command was carefully observed,\r\ntheir obstinacy in bringing false accusations came to an end, and they\r\nall, being disappointed in their object, returned home.\r\n\r\n5. After which, as if at the dictation of justice herself, a law was\r\npublished forbidding any one to exact from any officer the restitution\r\nof things which that officer had legally received.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nA.D. 362.\r\n\r\n§ 1. At the beginning of the new year, when the consular records had\r\nreceived the names of Mamertinus and Nevitta, the prince humbled himself\r\nby walking in their train with other men of high rank; an act which some\r\npraised, while others blame it as full of affectation, and mean.\r\n\r\n2. Afterwards, when Mamertinus was celebrating the Circensian games,\r\nJulian, following an ancient fashion, manumitted some slaves, who were\r\nintroduced by the consul's officer; but afterwards, being informed that\r\non that day the supreme jurisdiction belonged to another, he fined\r\nhimself ten pounds of gold as an offender.\r\n\r\n3. At the same time he was a continual attendant in the court of\r\njustice, settling many actions which were brought in all kinds of cases.\r\nOne day while he was sitting as judge, the arrival of a certain\r\nphilosopher from Asia named Maximus, was announced, on which he leapt\r\ndown from the judgment seat in an unseemly manner, and forgetting\r\nhimself so far as to run at full speed from the hall, he kissed him, and\r\nreceived him with great reverence, and led him into the palace,\r\nappearing by this unseasonable ostentation a seeker of empty glory, and\r\nforgetful of those admirable words of Cicero, which describe people like\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n4. \"Those very philosophers inscribe their names on the identical books\r\nwhich they write about the contempt of glory, in order that they may be\r\nnamed and extolled in that very thing in which they proclaim their\r\ncontempt for mention and for praise.\"[122]\r\n\r\n5. Not long afterwards, two of the secretaries who had been banished\r\ncame to him, boldly promising to point out the hiding-place of\r\nFlorentius if he would restore them to their rank in the army; but he\r\nabused them, and called them informers; adding that it did not become an\r\nemperor to be led by underhand information to bring back a man who had\r\nconcealed himself out of fear of death, and who perhaps would not long\r\nbe left in his retreat unpardoned.\r\n\r\n6. On all these occasions Prætextatus was present, a senator of a noble\r\ndisposition and of old-fashioned dignity; who at that time had come to\r\nConstantinople on his own private affairs, and whom Julian by his own\r\nchoice selected as governor of Achaia with the rank of proconsul.\r\n\r\n7. Still, while thus diligent in correcting civil evils, Julian did not\r\nomit the affairs of the army: continually appointing over the soldiers\r\nofficers of long-tried worth; repairing the exterior defences of all the\r\ncities throughout Thrace, and taking great care that the soldiers on the\r\nbanks of the Danube, who were exposed to the attacks of the barbarians,\r\nand who, as he heard were doing their duty with vigilance and courage,\r\nshould never be in want of arms, clothes, pay, or provisions.\r\n\r\n8. And while superintending these matters he allowed nothing to be done\r\ncarelessly: and when those about him advised him to attack the Gauls as\r\nneighbours who were always deceitful and perfidious, he said he wished\r\nfor more formidable foes; for that the Gallic merchants were enough for\r\nthem, who sold them at all times without any distinction of rank.\r\n\r\n9. While he gave his attention to these and similar matters, his fame\r\nwas spreading among foreign nations for courage, temperance, skill in\r\nwar, and eminent endowments of every kind of virtue, so that he\r\ngradually became renowned throughout the whole world.\r\n\r\n10. And as the fear of his approach pervaded both neighbouring and\r\ndistant countries, embassies hastened to him with unusual speed from all\r\nquarters at one time; the people beyond the Tigris and the Armenians\r\nsued for peace. At another the Indian tribes vied with each other,\r\nsending nobles loaded with gifts even from the Maldive Islands and\r\nCeylon; from the south the Moors offered themselves as subjects of the\r\nRoman empire; from the north, and also from those hot climates through\r\nwhich the Phasis passes on its way to the sea, and from the people of\r\nthe Bosphorus, and from other unknown tribes came ambassadors entreating\r\nthat on the payment of annual duties they might be allowed to live in\r\npeace within their native countries.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. The time is now appropriate, in my opinion, since in treating of\r\nthis mighty prince we are come to speak of these districts, to explain\r\nperspicuously what we have learnt by our own eyesight or by reading,\r\nabout the frontiers of Thrace and the situation of the Black Sea.\r\n\r\n2. The lofty mountains of Athos in Macedonia, once made passable for\r\nships by the Persians, and the Euboean rocky promontory of Caphareus,\r\nwhere Nauplius the father of Palamedes wrecked the Grecian fleet, though\r\nfar distant from one another, separate the Ægean from the Thessalian\r\nSea, which, extending as it proceeds, on the right, where it is widest,\r\nis full of the Sporades and Cyclades islands, which latter are so called\r\nbecause they lie round Delos, an island celebrated as the birthplace of\r\nthe gods; on the left it washes Imbros, Tenedos, Lemnos, and Thasos; and\r\nwhen agitated by any gale it beats violently on Lesbos.\r\n\r\n3. From thence, with a receding current, it flows past the temple of\r\nApollo Sminthius, and Troas, and Troy, renowned for the adventures of\r\nheroes; and on the west it forms the Gulf of Melas, near the head of\r\nwhich is seen Abdera, the abode of Protagoras and Democritus; and the\r\nblood-stained seat of the Thracian Diomede; and the valleys through\r\nwhich the Maritza flows on its way to its waves; and Maronea, and Ænus,\r\nfounded under sad auspices and soon deserted by Æneas, when under the\r\nguidance of the gods he hastened onwards to ancient Italy.\r\n\r\n4. After this it narrows gradually, and, as if by a kind of natural wish\r\nto mingle with its waters, it rushes towards the Black Sea; and taking\r\na portion of it forms a figure like the Greek +Ph+. Then\r\nseparating the Hellespont from Mount Rhodope, it passes by\r\nCynossema,[123] where Hecuba is supposed to be buried, and Cæla, and\r\nSestos, and Callipolis, and passing by the tombs of Ajax and Achilles,\r\nit touches Dardanus and Abydos (where Xerxes, throwing a bridge across,\r\npassed over the waters on foot), and Lampsacus, given to Themistocles by\r\nthe king of Persia; and Parion, founded by Parius the son of Jason.\r\n\r\n5. Then curving round in a semicircle and separating the opposite lands\r\nmore widely in the round gulf of the sea of Marmora, it washes on the\r\neast Cyzicus, and Dindyma, the holy seat of the mighty mother Cybele,\r\nand Apamia, and Cius, and Astacus afterwards called Nicomedia from the\r\nKing Nicomedes.\r\n\r\n6. On the west it beats against the Chersonese, Ægospotami where\r\nAnaxagoras predicted that stones would fall from heaven, and Lysimachia,\r\nand the city which Hercules founded and consecrated to the memory of his\r\ncomrade Perinthus. And in order to preserve the full and complete figure\r\nof the letter +Ph+, in the very centre of the circular gulf lies\r\nthe oblong island of Proconnesus, and also Besbicus.\r\n\r\n7. Beyond the upper end of this island the sea again becomes very narrow\r\nwhere it separates Bithynia from Europe, passing by Chalcedon and\r\nChrysopolis, and some other places of no importance.\r\n\r\n8. Its left shore is looked down upon by Port Athyras and Selymbria, and\r\nConstantinople, formerly called Byzantium, a colony of the Athenians,\r\nand Cape Ceras, having at its extremity a lofty tower to serve as a\r\nlighthouse to ships--from which cape also a very cold wind which often\r\narises from that point is called Ceratas.\r\n\r\n9. The sea thus broken, and terminated by mingling with the seas at each\r\nend, and now becoming very calm, spreads out into wider waters, as far\r\nas the eye can reach both in length and breadth. Its entire circuit, if\r\none should measure it as one would measure an island, sailing along its\r\nshores, is 23,000 furlongs according to Eratosthenes, Hecatæus, and\r\nPtolemy, and other accurate investigators of subjects of this kind,\r\nresembling, by the consent of all geographers, a Scythian bow, held at\r\nboth ends by its string.\r\n\r\n10. When the sun rises from the eastern ocean, it is shut in by the\r\nmarshes of the Sea of Azov. On the west it is bounded by the Roman\r\nprovinces. On the north lie many tribes differing in language and\r\nmanners; its southern side describes a gentle curve.\r\n\r\n11. Over this extended space are dispersed many Greek cities, which have\r\nfor the most part been founded by the people of Miletus, an Athenian\r\ncolony, long since established in Asia among the other Ionians by\r\nNileus, the son of the famous Codrus, who is said to have devoted\r\nhimself to his country in the Doric war.\r\n\r\n12. The thin extremities of the bow at each end are commanded by the two\r\nBospori, the Thracian and Cimmerian, placed opposite to one another; and\r\nthey are called Bospori because through them the daughter of\r\nInachus,[124] who was changed (as the poets relate) into a cow, passed\r\ninto the Ionian sea.\r\n\r\n13. The right curve of the Thracian Bosphorus is covered by a side of\r\nBithynia, formerly called Mygdonia, of which province Thynia and\r\nMariandena are districts; as also is Bebrycia, the inhabitants of which\r\nwere delivered from the cruelty of Amycus by the valour of Pollux; and\r\nalso the remote spot in which the soothsayer Phineus was terrified by\r\nthe threatening flight of the Harpies.\r\n\r\n14. The shores are curved into several long bays, into which fall the\r\nrivers Sangarius, and Phyllis, and Bizes, and Rebas; and opposite to\r\nthem at the lower end are the Symplegades, two rocks which rise into\r\nabrupt peaks, and which in former times were accustomed to dash against\r\none another with a fearful crash, and then rebounding with a sharp\r\nspring, to recoil once more against the object already struck. Even a\r\nbird could by no speed of its wings pass between these rocks as they\r\npass and meet again without being crushed to death.\r\n\r\n15. These rocks, when the Argo, the first of all ships, hastening to\r\nColchis to carry off the golden fleece, had passed unhurt by them, stood\r\nimmovable for the future, the power of the whirlwind which used to\r\nagitate them being broken; and are now so firmly united that no one who\r\nsaw them now would believe that they had ever been separated; if all the\r\npoems of the ancients did not agree on the point.\r\n\r\n16. After this portion of Bithynia, the next provinces are Pontus and\r\nPaphlagonia, in which are the noble cities of Heraclea, and Sinope, and\r\nPolemonium, and Amisus, and Tios, and Amastris, all originally founded\r\nby the energy of the Greeks; and Cerasus, from which Lucullus brought\r\nthe cherry, and two lofty islands which contain the famous cities of\r\nTrapezus and Pityus.\r\n\r\n17. Beyond these places is the Acherusian cave, which the natives call\r\n+Mychopontion+; and the harbour of Acone, and several rivers, the\r\nAcheron, the Arcadius, the Iris, the Tibris, and near to that the\r\nParthenius, all of which proceed with a rapid stream into the sea. Close\r\nto them is the Thermodon, which rises in Mount Armonius, and flows\r\nthrough the forest of Themiscyra, to which necessity formerly compelled\r\nthe Amazons to migrate.\r\n\r\n18. The Amazons, as may be here explained, after having ravaged their\r\nneighbours by bloody inroads, and overpowered them by repeated defeats,\r\nbegan to entertain greater projects; and perceiving their own strength\r\nto be superior to their neighbours', and being continually covetous of\r\ntheir possessions, they forced their way through many nations, and\r\nattacked the Athenians. But they were routed in a fierce battle, and\r\ntheir flanks being uncovered by cavalry, they all perished.\r\n\r\n19. When their destruction became known, the rest, who had been left at\r\nhome as unwarlike, were reduced to the last extremities; and fearing the\r\nattacks of their neighbours, who would now retaliate on them, they\r\nremoved to the more quiet district of the Thermodon. And after a long\r\ntime, their posterity again becoming numerous, returned in great force\r\nto their native regions, and became in later ages formidable to the\r\npeople of many nations.\r\n\r\n20. Not far from hence is the gentle hill Carambis, on the north,\r\nopposite to which, at a distance of 2,500 furlongs, is the Criu-Metopon,\r\na promontory of Taurica. From this spot the whole of the sea-coast,\r\nbeginning at the river Halys, is like the chord of an arc fastened at\r\nboth ends.\r\n\r\n21. On the frontiers of this district are the Dahæ,[125] the fiercest\r\nof all warriors; and the Chalybes, the first people who dug up iron, and\r\nwrought it to the use of man. Next to them lies a large plain occupied\r\nby the Byzares, the Saqires, the Tibareni, the Mosynæci, the Macrones\r\nand the Philyres, tribes with which we have no intercourse.\r\n\r\n22. And at a small distance from them are some monuments of heroes,\r\nwhere Sthenelus, Idmon, and Tiphys are buried, the first being that one\r\nof Hercules's comrades who was mortally wounded in the war with the\r\nAmazons; the second the soothsayer of the Argonauts; the third the\r\nskilful pilot of the crew.\r\n\r\n23. After passing by the aforesaid districts, we come to the cave Aulon,\r\nand the river of Callichorus, which derives its name from the fact that\r\nwhen Bacchus, having subdued the nations of India in a three years' war,\r\ncame into those countries, he chose the green and shady banks of this\r\nriver for the re-establishment of his ancient orgies and dances; and\r\nsome think that such festivals as these were those called\r\nTrieterica.[126]\r\n\r\n24. Next to these frontiers come the famous cantons of the Camaritæ, and\r\nthe Phasis, which with its roaring streams reaches the Colchi, a race\r\ndescended from the Egyptians; among whom, besides other cities, is one\r\ncalled Phasis from the name of the river; and Dioscurias,[127] still\r\nfamous, which is said to have been founded by the Spartans Amphitus and\r\nCercius, the charioteers of Castor and Pollux; from whom the nation of\r\nHeniochi[128] derives its origin.\r\n\r\n25. At a little distance from these are the Achæi, who after some\r\nearlier Trojan war, and not that which began about Helen, as some\r\nauthors have affirmed, were driven into Pontus by foul winds, and, as\r\nall around was hostile, so that they could nowhere find a settled abode,\r\nthey always stationed themselves on the tops of snowy mountains; and,\r\nunder the pressure of an unfavourable climate they contracted a habit of\r\nliving on plunder in contempt of all danger; and thus became the most\r\nferocious of all nations. Of the Cercetæ, who lie next to them, nothing\r\nis known worth speaking of.\r\n\r\n26. Behind them lie the inhabitants of the Cimmerian Bosphorus, living\r\nin cities founded by the Milesiani, the chief of which is Panticapæum,\r\nwhich is on the Bog a river of great size, both from its natural waters\r\nand the streams which fall into it.\r\n\r\n27. Then for a great distance the Amazons stretch as far as the Caspian\r\nsea; occupying the banks of the Don, which rises in Mount Caucasus, and\r\nproceeds in a winding course, separating Asia from Europe, and falls\r\ninto the swampy sea of Azov.\r\n\r\n28. Near to this is the Rha, on the banks of which grows a vegetable of\r\nthe same name, which is useful as a remedy for many diseases.\r\n\r\n29. Beyond the Don, taking the plain in its width, lie the Sauromatæ,\r\nwhose land is watered by the never-failing rivers Maræcus, Rhombites,\r\nTheophanes, and Totordanes. And there is at a vast distance another\r\nnation also known as Sauromatæ, touching the shore at the point where\r\nthe river Corax falls into the sea.\r\n\r\n30. Near to this is the sea of Azov, of great extent, from the abundant\r\nsources of which a great body of water pours through the straits of\r\nPatares, near the Black Sea; on the right are the islands Phanagorus and\r\nHermonassa, which have been settled by the industry of the Greeks.\r\n\r\n31. Round the furthest extremity of this gulf dwell many tribes\r\ndiffering from one another in language and habits; the Jaxamatæ, the\r\nMæotæ, the Jazyges, the Roxolani, the Alani, the Melanchlænæ, the\r\nGeloni, and the Agathyrsi, whose land abounds in adamant.\r\n\r\n32. And there are others beyond, who are the most remote people of the\r\nwhole world. On the left side of this gulf lies the Crimea, full of\r\nGreek colonies; the people of which are quiet and steady: they practise\r\nagriculture, and live on the produce of the land.\r\n\r\n33. From them the Tauri, though at no great distance, are separated by\r\nseveral kingdoms, among which are the Arinchi, a most savage tribe, the\r\nSinchi, and the Napæi, whose cruelty, being aggravated by continual\r\nlicence, is the reason why the sea is called the Inhospitable,[129]\r\nfrom which by the rule of contrary it gets the name of the Euxine, just\r\nas the Greeks call a fool +euêthês+, and night +euthronê+,\r\nand the furies, the +Eumenides+.\r\n\r\n34. For they propitiated the gods with human victims, sacrificing\r\nstrangers to Diana, whom they call Oreiloche, and fix the heads of the\r\nslain on the walls of their temples, as perpetual monuments of their\r\ndeeds.\r\n\r\n35. In this kingdom of the Tauri lies the uninhabited island of Leuce,\r\nwhich is consecrated to Achilles; and if any ever visit it, as soon as\r\nthey have examined the traces of antiquity, and the temple and offerings\r\ndedicated to the hero, they return the same evening to their ships, as\r\nit is said that no one can pass the night there without danger to his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n36. There is water there, and white birds like kingfishers, the origin\r\nof which, and the battles of the Hellespont, we will discuss at a proper\r\ntime. And there are some cities in this region of which the most eminent\r\nare Eupatoria, Dandaca, and Theodosia, and several others which are free\r\nfrom the wickedness of human sacrifices.\r\n\r\n37. Up to this we reckon that one of the extremities of the arc extends.\r\nWe will now follow, as order suggests, the rest of the curve which\r\nextends towards the north, along the left side of the Thracian\r\nBosphorus, just reminding the reader that while the bows of all other\r\nnations bend along the whole of their material, those of the Scythians\r\nand Parthians have a straight rounded line in the centre, from which\r\nthey curve their spreading horns so as to present the figure of the\r\nwaning moon.\r\n\r\n38. At the very beginning then of this district, where the Rhipæan\r\nmountains end, lie the Arimphæi, a just people known for their quiet\r\ncharacter, whose land is watered by the rivers Chronius and Bisula; and\r\nnext to them are the Massagetæ, the Alani, and the Sargetæ, and several\r\nother tribes of little note, of whom we know neither the names nor the\r\ncustoms.\r\n\r\n39. Then, a long way off, is the bay Carcinites, and a river of the\r\nsame name, and a grove of Diana, frequented by many votaries in those\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n40. After that we come to the Dnieper (Borysthenes), which rises in the\r\nmountains of the Neuri; a river very large at its first beginning, and\r\nwhich increases by the influx of many other streams, till it falls into\r\nthe sea with great violence; on its woody banks is the town of\r\nBorysthenes, and Cephalonesus, and some altars consecrated to Alexander\r\nthe Great and Augustus Cæsar.\r\n\r\n41. Next, at a great distance, is an island inhabited by the Sindi, a\r\ntribe of low-born persons, who upon the overthrow of their lords and\r\nmasters in Asia, took possession of their wives and properties. Below\r\nthem is a narrow strip of coast called by the natives the Course of\r\nAchilles, having been made memorable in olden time by the exercises of\r\nthe Thessalian chief, and next to that is the city of Tyros, a colony of\r\nthe Phoenicians, watered by the river Dniester.\r\n\r\n42. But in the middle of the arc which we have described as being of an\r\nextended roundness, and which takes an active traveller fifteen days to\r\ntraverse, are the Europæan Alani, the Costoboci, and the countless\r\ntribes of the Scythians, who extend over territories which have no\r\nascertained limit; a small part of whom live on grain. But the rest\r\nwander over vast deserts, knowing neither ploughtime nor seedtime; but\r\nliving in cold and frost, and feeding like great beasts. They place\r\ntheir relations, their homes, and their wretched furniture on waggons\r\ncovered with bark, and, whenever they choose, they migrate without\r\nhindrance, driving off these waggons wherever they like.\r\n\r\n43. When one arrives at another point of the circuit where there is a\r\nharbour, which bounds the figure of the arc at that extremity, the\r\nisland Peuce is conspicuous, inhabited by the Troglodytæ, and Peuci, and\r\nother inferior tribes, and we come also to Histros, formerly a city of\r\ngreat power, and to Tomi, Apollonia, Anchialos, Odissos, and many others\r\non the Thracian coast.\r\n\r\n44. But the Danube, rising near Basle on the borders of the Tyrol,\r\nextending over a wider space, and receiving on his way nearly sixty\r\nnavigable rivers, pours through the Scythian territory by seven mouths\r\ninto the Black Sea.\r\n\r\n45. The first mouth (according to the Greek interpretation of the\r\nnames) is at the island of Peuce, which we have mentioned; the second is\r\nat Naracustoma, the third at Calonstoma, the fourth at Pseudostoma. The\r\nBoreonstoma and the Sthenostoma, are much smaller, and the seventh is\r\nlarge and black-looking like a bog.\r\n\r\n46. But the whole sea, all around, is full of mists and shoals, and is\r\nsweeter than seas in general, because by the evaporation of moisture the\r\nair is often thick and dense, and its waters are tempered by the\r\nimmensity of the rivers which fall into it; and it is full of shifting\r\nshallows, because the number of the streams which surround it pour in\r\nmud and lumps of soil.\r\n\r\n47. And it is well known that fish flock in large shoals to its most\r\nremote extremities that they may spawn and rear their young more\r\nhealthfully, in consequence of the salubrity of the water; while the\r\nhollow caverns, which are very numerous there, protect them from\r\nvoracious monsters. For nothing of the kind is ever seen in this sea,\r\nexcept some small dolphins, and they do no harm.\r\n\r\n48. Now the portions of the Black Sea which are exposed to the north\r\nwind are so thoroughly frozen that, while the rivers, as it is believed,\r\ncannot continue their course beneath the ice, yet neither can the foot\r\nof beast or man proceed firmly over the treacherous and shifting ground;\r\na fault which is never found in a pure sea, but only in one of which the\r\nwaters are mingled with those of rivers. We have digressed more than we\r\nhad intended, so now let us turn back to what remains to be told.\r\n\r\n49. Another circumstance came to raise Julian's present joy, one which\r\nindeed had been long expected, but which had been deferred by all manner\r\nof delays. For intelligence was brought by Agilo and Jovius, who was\r\nafterwards quæstor, that the garrison of Aquileia, weary of the length\r\nof the siege, and having heard of the death of Constantius, had opened\r\ntheir gates and come forth, delivering up the authors of the revolt; and\r\nthat, after they had been burnt alive, as has been related, the rest had\r\nobtained pardon for their offences.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\n§ 1. But Julian, elated at his prosperity, began to aspire to greatness\r\nbeyond what is granted to man: amid continual dangers he had learnt by\r\nexperience that propitious fortune held out to him, thus peacefully\r\ngoverning the Roman world, a cornucopia as it were of human blessings\r\nand all kinds of glory and success: adding this also to his former\r\ntitles of victory, that while he alone held the reins of empire he was\r\nneither disturbed by intestine commotions, nor did any barbarians\r\nventure to cross his frontiers; but all nations, eager at all times to\r\nfind fault with what is past, as mischievous and unjust, were with\r\nmarvellous unanimity agreed in his praises.\r\n\r\n2. Having therefore arranged with profound deliberation all the matters\r\nwhich were required either by the circumstances of the state or by the\r\ntime, and, having encouraged the soldiers by repeated harangues and by\r\nadequate pay to be active in accomplishing all that was to be done,\r\nJulian, being in great favour with all men, set out for Antioch, leaving\r\nConstantinople, which he had greatly strengthened and enriched; for he\r\nhad been born there, and loved and protected it as his native city.\r\n\r\n3. Then crossing the straits, and passing by Chalcedon and Libyssa,\r\nwhere Hannibal the Carthaginian is buried, he came to Nicomedia; a city\r\nof ancient renown, and so adorned at the great expense of former\r\nemperors, that from the multitude of its public and private buildings\r\ngood judges look on it as a quarter, as it were, of the eternal city.\r\n\r\n4. When Julian beheld its walls buried in miserable ashes, he showed the\r\nanguish of his mind by silent tears, and went slowly on towards the\r\npalace; especially lamenting its misfortunes, because the senators who\r\ncame out to meet him were in poor-looking condition, as well as the\r\npeople who had formerly been most prosperous; some of them he recognized\r\nhaving been brought up there by the bishop Eusebius, of whom he was a\r\ndistant relation.\r\n\r\n5. Having here made many arrangements for repairing the damage done by\r\nan earthquake, he passed through Nisæa to the frontier of Gallo-Græcia,\r\nand then turning to the right, he went to Pessinus, to see the ancient\r\ntemple of Cybele; from which town in the second Punic war, in accordance\r\nwith the warning of the Sibylline verses, the image of the goddess was\r\nremoved to Rome by Scipio Nasica.\r\n\r\n6. Of its arrival in Italy, with many other matters connected with it,\r\nwe made mention in recording the acts of the emperor Commodus; but as to\r\nwhat the reason was for the town receiving this name writers differ.\r\n\r\n7. For some have declared that the city was so called +apo tou\r\npesein+, from falling; inventing a tale that the statue fell from\r\nheaven; others affirm that Ilus, the son of Tros, king of Dardania, gave\r\nthe place this name, which Theopompus says it received not from this,\r\nbut from Midas, formerly a most powerful king of Phrygia.\r\n\r\n8. Accordingly, having paid his worship to the goddess, and propitiated\r\nher with sacrifices and prayers, he returned to Ancyra; and as he was\r\nproceeding on this way from thence he was disturbed by a multitude; some\r\nviolently demanding the restoration of what had been taken from them,\r\nothers complaining that they had been unjustly attached to different\r\ncourts; some, regardless of the risk they ran, tried to enrage him\r\nagainst their adversaries, by charging them with treason.\r\n\r\n9. But he, a sterner judge than Cassius or Lycurgus, weighed the charges\r\nwith justice, and gave each his due; never being swayed from the truth,\r\nbut very severe to calumniators, whom he hated, because he himself,\r\nwhile still a private individual and of low estate, had often\r\nexperienced the petulant frenzy of many in a way which placed him in\r\ngreat danger.\r\n\r\n10. And though there are many other examples of his patience in such\r\nmatters, it will suffice to relate one here. A certain man laid an\r\ninformation against his enemy, with whom he had a most bitter quarrel,\r\naffirming that he had been guilty of outrage and sedition; and when the\r\nemperor concealed his own opinion, he renewed the charge for several\r\ndays, and when at last he was asked who the man was whom he was\r\naccusing, he replied, a rich citizen. When the emperor heard this he\r\nsmiled and said, \"What proof led you to the discovery of this conduct of\r\nhis?\" He replied, \"The man has had made for himself a purple silk robe.\"\r\n\r\n11. And on this, being ordered to depart in silence, and though\r\nunpunished as a low fellow who was accusing one of his own class of too\r\ndifficult an enterprise to be believed, he nevertheless insisted on the\r\ntruth of the accusation, till Julian, being wearied by his pertinacity,\r\nsaid to the treasurer, whom he saw near him, \"Bid them give this\r\ndangerous chatterer some purple shoes to take to his enemy, who, as he\r\ngives me to understood, has made himself a robe of that colour; that so\r\nhe may know how little a worthless piece of cloth can help a man,\r\nwithout the greatest strength.\"\r\n\r\n12. But as such conduct as this is praiseworthy and deserving the\r\nimitation of virtuous rulers, so it was a sad thing and deserving of\r\ncensure, that in his time it was very hard for any one who was accused\r\nby any magistrate to obtain justice, however fortified he might be by\r\nprivileges, or the number of his campaigns, or by a host of friends. So\r\nthat many persons being alarmed bought off all such annoyances by secret\r\nbribes.\r\n\r\n13. Therefore, when after a long journey he had reached Pylæ, a place on\r\nthe frontiers of Cappadocia and Cilicia, he received the ruler of the\r\nprovince, Celsus, already known to him by his Attic studies, with a\r\nkiss, and taking him up into his chariot conducted him with him into\r\nTarsus.\r\n\r\n14. From hence, desiring to see Antioch, the splendid metropolis of the\r\nEast, he went thither by the usual stages, and when he came near the\r\ncity he was received as if he had been a god, with public prayers, so\r\nthat he marvelled at the voices of the vast multitude, who cried out\r\nthat he had come to shine like a star on the Eastern regions.\r\n\r\n15. It happened that just at that time, the annual period for the\r\ncelebration of the festival of Adonis, according to the old fashion,\r\ncame round; the story being, as the poets relate, that Adonis had been\r\nloved by Venus, and slain by a boar's tusk, which is an emblem of the\r\nfruits of the earth being cut down in their prime. And it appeared a sad\r\nthing that when the emperor was now for the first time making his\r\nentrance into a splendid city, the abode of princes, wailing\r\nlamentations and sounds of mourning should be heard in every direction.\r\n\r\n16. And here was seen a proof of his gentle disposition, shown indeed\r\nin a trifling, but very remarkable instance. He had long hated a man\r\nnamed Thalassius, an officer in one of the law courts, as having been\r\nconcerned in plots against his brother Gallus. He prohibited him from\r\npaying his salutations to him and presenting himself among the men of\r\nrank; which encouraged his enemies against whom he had actions in the\r\ncourts of law, the next day, when a great crowd was collected in the\r\npresence of the emperor, to cry out, \"Thalassius, the enemy of your\r\nclemency, has violently deprived us of our rights;\" and Julian, thinking\r\nthat this was an opportunity for crushing him, replied, \"I acknowledge\r\nthat I am justly offended with the man whom you mention, and so you\r\nought to keep silence till he has made satisfaction to me who am his\r\nprincipal enemy.\" And he commanded the prefect who was sitting by him\r\nnot to hear their business till he himself was recognized by Thalassius,\r\nwhich happened soon afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\n§ 1. While wintering at Antioch, according to his wish, he yielded to\r\nnone of the allurements of pleasure in which all Syria abounds; but\r\nunder pretence of repose, he devoted himself to judicial affairs, which\r\nare not less difficult than those of war, and in which he expended\r\nexceeding care, showing exquisite willingness to receive information,\r\nand carefully balancing how to assign to every one his due. And by his\r\njust sentence the wicked were chastised with moderate punishments, and\r\nthe innocent were maintained in the undiminished possession of their\r\nfortunes.\r\n\r\n2. And although in the discussion of causes he was often unreasonable,\r\nasking at unsuitable times to what religion each of the litigants\r\nadhered, yet none of his decisions were found inconsistent with equity,\r\nnor could he ever be accused, either from considerations of religion or\r\nof anything else, of having deviated from the strict path of justice.\r\n\r\n3. For that is a desirable and right judgment which proceeds from\r\nrepeated examinations of what is just and unjust. Julian feared anything\r\nwhich might lead him away from such, as a sailor fears dangerous rocks;\r\nand he was the better able to attain to correctness, because, knowing\r\nthe levity of his own impetuous disposition, he used to permit the\r\nprefects and his chosen counsellors to check, by timely admonition, his\r\nown impulses when they were inclined to stray; and he continually showed\r\nthat he was vexed if he committed errors, and was desirous of being\r\ncorrected.\r\n\r\n4. And when the advocates in some actions were once applauding him\r\ngreatly as one who had attained to perfect wisdom, he is said to have\r\nexclaimed with much emotion, \"I was glad and made it my pride to be\r\npraised by those whom I knew to be competent to find fault with me, if I\r\nhad said or done anything wrong.\"\r\n\r\n5. But it will be sufficient out of the many instances of his clemency\r\nwhich he afforded in judging causes to mention this one, which is not\r\nirrelevant to our subject or insignificant. A certain woman being\r\nbrought before the court, saw that her adversary, formerly one of the\r\nofficers of the palace, but who had been displaced, was now, contrary to\r\nher expectation, re-established and girt in his official dress,\r\ncomplained in a violent manner of this circumstance; and the emperor\r\nreplied, \"Proceed, O woman, if you think that you have been injured in\r\nany respect; he is girt as you see in order to go more quickly through\r\nthe mire; your cause will not suffer from it.\"\r\n\r\n6. And these and similar actions led to the belief, as he was constantly\r\nsaying, that that ancient justice which Aratus states to have fled to\r\nheaven in disgust at the vices of mankind, had returned to earth; only\r\nthat sometimes he acted according to his own will rather than according\r\nto law, making mistakes which somewhat darkened the glorious course of\r\nhis renown.\r\n\r\n7. After many trials he corrected numerous abuses in the laws, cutting\r\naway circuitous proceedings, and making the enactments show more plainly\r\nwhat they commanded or forbade. But his forbidding masters of rhetoric\r\nand grammar to instruct Christians was a cruel action, and one deserving\r\nto be buried in everlasting silence.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\n§ 1. At this time, Gaudentius the secretary, whom I have mentioned above\r\nas having been sent by Constantius to oppose Julian in Africa, and a man\r\nof the name of Julian, who had been a deputy governor, and who was an\r\nintemperate partisan of the late emperor, were brought back as\r\nprisoners, and put to death.\r\n\r\n2. And at the same time, Artemius, who had been Duke of Egypt, and\r\nagainst whom the citizens of Alexandria brought a great mass of heavy\r\naccusations, was also put to death, and the son of Marcellus too, who\r\nhad been commander both of the infantry and of the cavalry, was publicly\r\nexecuted as one who had aspired to the empire by force of arms. Romanus,\r\ntoo, and Vincentius, the tribunes of the first and second battalion of\r\nthe Scutarii, being convicted of aiming at things beyond their due, were\r\nbanished.\r\n\r\n3. And after a short time, when the death of Artemius was known, the\r\ncitizens of Alexandria who had feared his return, lest, as he\r\nthreatened, he should come back among them with power, and avenge\r\nhimself on many of them for the offences which he had received, now\r\nturned all their anger against George, the bishop, by whom they had, so\r\nto say, been often attacked with poisonous bites.\r\n\r\n4. George having been born in a fuller's shop, as was reported, in\r\nEpiphania, a town of Cilicia, and having caused the ruin of many\r\nindividuals, was, contrary both to his own interest and to that of the\r\ncommonwealth, ordained bishop of Alexandria, a city which from its own\r\nimpulses, and without any special cause, is continually agitated by\r\nseditious tumults, as the oracles also show.\r\n\r\n5. Men of this irritable disposition were readily incensed by George,\r\nwho accused numbers to the willing ears of Constantius, as being opposed\r\nto his authority; and, forgetting his profession, which ought to give no\r\ncounsel but what is just and merciful, he adopted all the wicked acts of\r\ninformers.\r\n\r\n6. And among other things he was reported to have maliciously informed\r\nConstantius that in that city all the edifices which had been built by\r\nAlexander, its founder, at vast public expense, ought properly to be a\r\nsource of emolument to the treasury.\r\n\r\n7. To these wicked suggestions he added this also, which soon afterwards\r\nled to his destruction. As he was returning from court, and passing by\r\nthe superb temple of the Genius, escorted by a large train, as was his\r\ncustom, he turned his eyes towards the temple, and said, \"How long shall\r\nthis sepulchre stand?\" And the multitude, hearing this, was\r\nthunderstruck, and fearing that he would seek to destroy this also,\r\nlaboured to the utmost of their power to effect his ruin by secret\r\nplots.\r\n\r\n8. When suddenly there came the joyful news that Artemius was dead; on\r\nwhich all the populace, triumphing with unexpected joy, gnashed their\r\nteeth, and with horrid outcries set upon George, trampling upon him and\r\nkicking him, and tearing him to pieces with every kind of mutilation.\r\n\r\n9. With him also, Dracontius, the master of the mint, and a count named\r\nDiodorus, were put to death, and dragged with ropes tied to their legs\r\nthrough the street; the one because he had overthrown the altar lately\r\nset up in the mint, of which he was governor; the other because while\r\nsuperintending the building of a church, he insolently cut off the curls\r\nof the boys, thinking thus to affect the worship of the gods.\r\n\r\n10. But the savage populace were not content with this; but having\r\nmutilated their bodies, put them on camels and conveyed them to the\r\nshore, where they burnt them and threw the ashes into the sea; fearing,\r\nas they exclaimed, lest their remains should be collected and a temple\r\nraised over them, as the relics of men who, being urged to forsake their\r\nreligion, had preferred to endure torturing punishments even to a\r\nglorious death, and so, by keeping their faith inviolate, earning the\r\nappellation of martyrs. In truth the wretched men who underwent such\r\ncruel punishment might have been protected by the aid of the Christians,\r\nif both parties had not been equally exasperated by hatred of George.\r\n\r\n11. When this event reached the emperor's ears, he roused himself to\r\navenge the impious deed; but when about to inflict the extremity of\r\npunishment on the guilty, he was appeased by the intercession of those\r\nabout him, and contented himself with issuing an edict in which he\r\ncondemned the crime which had been committed in stern language, and\r\nthreatening all with the severest vengeance if anything should be\r\nattempted for the future contrary to the principles of justice and law.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. In the mean time, while preparing the expedition against the\r\nPersians, which he had long been meditating with all the vigour of his\r\nmind, he resolved firmly to avenge their past victories; hearing from\r\nothers, and knowing by his own experience, that for nearly sixty years\r\nthat most ferocious people had stamped upon the East bloody records of\r\nmassacre and ravage, many of our armies having often been entirely\r\ndestroyed by them.\r\n\r\n2. And he was inflamed with a desire for the war on two grounds: first,\r\nbecause he was weary of peace, and dreaming always of trumpets and\r\nbattles; and secondly, because, having been in his youth exposed to the\r\nattacks of savage nations, the wishes of whose kings and princes were\r\nalready turning against us, and whom, as was believed, it would be\r\neasier to conquer than to reduce to the condition of suppliants, he was\r\neager to add to his other glories the surname of Parthieus.\r\n\r\n3. But when his inactive and malicious detractors saw that these\r\npreparations were being pressed forward with great speed and energy,\r\nthey cried out that it was an unworthy and shameful thing for such\r\nunseasonable troubles to be caused by the change of a single prince, and\r\nlaboured with all their zeal to postpone the campaign; and they were in\r\nthe habit of saying, in the presence of those whom they thought likely\r\nto report their words to the emperor, that, unless he conducted himself\r\nwith moderation during his excess of prosperity, he, like an\r\nover-luxuriant crop, would soon be destroyed by his own fertility.\r\n\r\n4. And they were continually propagating sayings of this kind, barking\r\nin vain at the inflexible prince with secret attacks, as the Pygmies or\r\nthe clown Thiodamas of Lindus assailed Hercules.\r\n\r\n5. But he, as more magnanimous, allowed no delay to take place, nor any\r\ndiminution in the magnitude of his expedition, but devoted the most\r\nenergetic care to prepare everything suitable for such an enterprise.\r\n\r\n6. He offered repeated victims on the altars of the gods; sometimes\r\nsacrificing one hundred bulls, and countless flocks of animals of all\r\nkinds, and white birds, which he sought for everywhere by land, and sea;\r\nso that every day individual soldiers who had stuffed themselves like\r\nboors with too much meat, or who were senseless from the eagerness with\r\nwhich they had drunk, were placed on the shoulders of passers-by, and\r\ncarried to their homes through the streets from the public temples where\r\nthey had indulged in feasts which deserved punishment rather than\r\nindulgence. Especially the Petulantes and the Celtic legion, whose\r\naudacity at this time had increased to a marvellous degree.\r\n\r\n7. And rites and ceremonies were marvellously multiplied with a vastness\r\nof expense hitherto unprecedented; and, as it was now allowed without\r\nhindrance, every one professed himself skilful in divination, and all,\r\nwhether illiterate or learned, without any limit or any prescribed\r\norder, were permitted to consult the oracles, and to inspect the\r\nentrails of victims; and omens from the voice of birds, and every kind\r\nof sign of the future, was sought for with an ostentatious variety of\r\nproceeding.\r\n\r\n8. And while this was going on, as if it were a time of profound peace,\r\nJulian, being curious in all such branches of learning, entered on a new\r\npath of divination. He proposed to reopen the prophetic springs of the\r\nfountain of Castalia, which Hadrian was said to have blocked up with a\r\nhuge mass of stones, fearing lest, as he himself had attained the\r\nsovereignty through obedience to the predictions of these waters, others\r\nmight learn a similar lesson; and Julian immediately ordered the bodies\r\nwhich had been buried around it to be removed with the same ceremonies\r\nas those with which the Athenians had purified the island of Delos.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. About the same time, on the 22nd of October, the splendid temple of\r\nApollo, at Daphne, which that furious and cruel king Antiochus Epiphanes\r\nhad built with the statue of the god, equal in size to that of Olympian\r\nJupiter, was suddenly burnt down.\r\n\r\n2. This terrible accident inflamed the emperor with such anger, that he\r\ninstantly ordered investigations of unprecedented severity to be\r\ninstituted, and the chief church of Antioch to be shut up. For he\r\nsuspected that the Christians had done it out of envy, not being able to\r\nbear the sight of the magnificent colonnade which surrounded the temple.\r\n\r\n3. But it was reported, though the rumour was most vague, that the\r\ntemple had been burnt by means of Asclepiades the philosopher, of whom\r\nwe have made mention while relating the actions of Magnentius. He is\r\nsaid to have come to the suburb in which the temple stood to pay a visit\r\nto Julian, and being accustomed to carry with him wherever he went a\r\nsmall silver statue of the Heavenly Venus, he placed it at the feet of\r\nthe image of Apollo, and then, according to his custom, having lighted\r\nwax tapers in front of it, he went away. At midnight, when no one was\r\nthere to give any assistance, some sparks flying about stuck to the aged\r\ntimbers; and from that dry fuel a fire was kindled which burnt\r\neverything it could reach, however separated from it by the height of\r\nthe building.\r\n\r\n4. The same year also, just as winter was approaching, there was a\r\nfearful scarcity of water, so that some rivers were dried up, and\r\nfountains too, which had hitherto abounded with copious springs. But\r\nafterwards they all were fully restored.\r\n\r\n5. And on the second of December, as evening was coming on, all that\r\nremained of Nicomedia was destroyed by an earthquake, and no small\r\nportion of Nicæa.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\n§ 1. These events caused great concern to the emperor; but still he did\r\nnot neglect other affairs of urgency, till the time of entering on his\r\nintended campaign should arrive. But in the midst of his important and\r\nserious concerns, it appeared superfluous that, without any plausible\r\nreason, and out of a mere thirst for popularity, he took measures for\r\nproducing cheapness; a thing which often proves contrary to expectation\r\nand produces scarcity and famine.\r\n\r\n2. And when the magistrates of Antioch plainly proved to him that his\r\norders could not be executed, he would not depart from his purpose,\r\nbeing as obstinate as his brother Gallus, but not bloodthirsty. On which\r\naccount, becoming furious against them, as slanderous and obstinate, he\r\ncomposed a volume of invectives which he called \"The Antiochean,\" or\r\n\"Misopogon,\" enumerating in a bitter spirit all the vices of the city,\r\nand adding others beyond the truth; and when on this he found that many\r\nwitticisms were uttered at his expense, he felt compelled to conceal his\r\nfeelings for a time; but was full of internal rage.\r\n\r\n3. For he was ridiculed as a Cercops;[130] again, as a dwarf spreading\r\nout his narrow shoulders, wearing a beard like that of a goat, and\r\ntaking huge strides, as if he had been the brother of Otus and\r\nEphialtes,[131] whose height Horace speaks of as enormous. At another\r\ntime he was \"the victim-killer,\" instead of the worshipper, in allusion\r\nto the numbers of his victims; and this piece of ridicule was seasonable\r\nand deserved, as once out of ostentation he was fond of carrying the\r\nsacred vessels before the priests, attended by a train of girls. And\r\nalthough these and similar jests made him very indignant, he\r\nnevertheless kept silence, and concealed his emotions, and continued to\r\ncelebrate the solemn festivals.\r\n\r\n4. At last, on the day appointed for the holiday, he ascended Mount\r\nCasius, a mountain covered with trees, very lofty, and of a round form;\r\nfrom which at the second crowing of the cock[132] we can see the sun\r\nrise. And while he was sacrificing to Jupiter, on a sudden he perceived\r\nsome one lying on the ground, who, with the voice of a suppliant,\r\nimplored pardon and his life; and when Julian asked him who he was, he\r\nreplied, that he was Theodotus, formerly the chief magistrate of\r\nHierapolis, who, when Constantius quitted that city, had escorted him\r\nwith other men of rank on his way; basely flattering him as sure to be\r\nvictorious; and he had entreated him with feigned tears and lamentations\r\nto send them the head of Julian as that of an ungrateful rebel, in the\r\nsame way as he recollected the head of Magnentius had been exhibited.\r\n\r\n5. When Julian heard this, he said, \"I have heard of this before, from\r\nthe relation of several persons. But go thou home in security, being\r\nrelieved of all fear by the mercy of the emperor, who, like a wise man,\r\nhas resolved to diminish the number of his enemies, and is eager to\r\nincrease that of his friends.\"\r\n\r\n6. When he departed, having fully accomplished the sacrifices, letters\r\nwere brought to him from the governor of Egypt, who informed him that\r\nafter a long time he had succeeded in finding a bull Apis, which he had\r\nbeen seeking with great labour, a circumstance which, in the opinion of\r\nthe inhabitants of those regions, indicates prosperity, abundant crops,\r\nand several other kinds of good fortune.\r\n\r\n7. On this subject it seems desirable to say a few words. Among the\r\nanimals which have been consecrated by the reverence of the ancients,\r\nMnevis and Apis are the most eminent. Mnevis, concerning whom there is\r\nnothing remarkable related, is consecrated to the sun, Apis to the moon.\r\nBut the bull Apis is distinguished by several natural marks; and\r\nespecially by a crescent-shaped figure, like that of a new moon, on his\r\nright side. After living his appointed time, he is drowned in the sacred\r\nfountain (for he is not allowed to live beyond the time fixed by the\r\nsacred authority of their mystical books; nor is a cow brought to him\r\nmore than once a year, who also must be distinguished with particular\r\nmarks); then another is sought amid great public mourning; and if one\r\ncan be found distinguished by all the required marks, he is led to\r\nMemphis, a city of great renown, and especially celebrated for the\r\npatronage of the god Æsculapius.\r\n\r\n8. And after he has been led into the city by one hundred priests, and\r\nconducted into a chamber, he is looked upon as consecrated, and is said\r\nto point out by evident means the signs of future events. Some also of\r\nthose who come to him he repels by unfavourable signs; as it is reported\r\nhe formally rejected Cæsar Germanicus when he offered him food; thus\r\nportending what shortly happened.\r\n\r\n\r\nXV.\r\n\r\n§ 1. Let us then, since the occasion seems to require it, touch briefly\r\non the affairs of Egypt, of which we have already made some mention in\r\nour account of the emperors Hadrian and Severus, where we related\r\nseveral things which we had seen.[133]\r\n\r\n2. The Egyptian is the most ancient of all nations, except indeed that\r\nits superior antiquity is contested by the Scythians: their country is\r\nbounded on the south[134] by the greater Syrtes, Cape Ras, and Cape\r\nBorion, the Garamantes, and other nations; on the east, by Elephantine,\r\nand Meroe, cities of the Ethiopians, the Catadupi, the Red Sea, and the\r\nScenite Arabs, whom we now call Saracens. On the north it joins a vast\r\ntrack of land, where Asia and the Syrian provinces begin; on the west it\r\nis bounded by the Sea of Issus, which some call the Parthenian Sea.\r\n\r\n3. We will also say a few words concerning that most useful of all\r\nrivers, the Nile, which Homer calls the Ægyptus; and after that we will\r\nenumerate other things worthy of admiration in these regions.\r\n\r\n4. The sources of the Nile, in my opinion, will be as unknown to\r\nposterity as they are now. But since poets, who relate fully, and\r\ngeographers who differ from one another, give various accounts of this\r\nhidden matter, I will in a few words set forth such of their opinions as\r\nseem to me to border on the truth.\r\n\r\n5. Some natural philosophers affirm that in the districts beneath the\r\nNorth Pole, when the severe winters bind up everything, the vast masses\r\nof snow congeal; and afterwards, melted by the warmth of the summer,\r\nthey make the clouds heavy with liquid moisture, which, being driven to\r\nthe south by the Etesian winds, and dissolved into rain by the heat of\r\nthe sun, furnish abundant increase to the Nile.\r\n\r\n6. Some, again, assert that the inundations of the river at fixed times\r\nare caused by the rains in Ethiopia, which fall in great abundance in\r\nthat country during the hot season; but both these theories seem\r\ninconsistent with the truth--for rain never falls in Ethiopia, or at\r\nleast only at rare intervals.\r\n\r\n7. A more common opinion is, that during the continuance of the wind\r\nfrom the north, called the Precursor, and of the Etesian gales, which\r\nlast forty-five days without interruption, they drive back the stream\r\nand check its speed, so that it becomes swollen with its waves thus\r\ndammed back; then, when the wind changes, the force of the breeze drives\r\nthe waters to and fro, and the river growing rapidly greater, its\r\nperennial sources driving it forward, it rises as it advances, and\r\ncovers everything, spreading over the level plains till it resembles the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n8. But King Juba, relying on the text of the Carthaginian books, affirms\r\nthat the river rises in a mountain situated in Mauritania, which looks\r\non the Atlantic Ocean, and he says, too, that this is proved by the fact\r\nthat fishes, and herbs, and animals resembling those of the Nile are\r\nfound in the marshes where the river rises.\r\n\r\n9. But the Nile, passing through the districts of Ethiopia, and many\r\ndifferent countries which give it their own names, swells its\r\nfertilizing stream till it comes to the cataracts. These are abrupt\r\nrocks, from which in its precipitous course it falls with such a crash,\r\nthat the Ati, who used to live in that district, having lost their\r\nhearing from the incessant roar, were compelled to migrate to a more\r\nquiet region.\r\n\r\n10. Then proceeding more gently, and receiving no accession of waters in\r\nEgypt, it falls into the sea through seven mouths, each of which is as\r\nserviceable as, and resembles, a separate river. And besides the several\r\nstreams which are derived from its channel, and which fall with others\r\nlike themselves, there are seven navigable with large waves; named by\r\nthe ancients the Heracleotic, the Sebennitic, the Bolbitic, the\r\nPhatnitic, the Mendesian, the Tanitic, and the Pelusian mouths.\r\n\r\n11. This river, rising as I have said, is driven on from the marshes to\r\nthe cataracts, and forms several islands; some of which are said to be\r\nof such extent that the stream is three days in passing them.\r\n\r\n12. Among these are two of especial celebrity, Meroe and Delta. The\r\nlatter derives its name from its triangular form like the Greek letter;\r\nbut when the sun begins to pass through the sign of Cancer, the river\r\nkeeps increasing till it passes into Libra; and then, after flowing at a\r\ngreat height for one hundred days, it falls again, and its waters being\r\ndiminished it exhibits, in a state fit for riding on, fields which just\r\nbefore could only be passed over in boats.\r\n\r\n13. If the inundation be too abundant it is mischievous, just as it is\r\nunproductive if it be too sparing; for if the flood be excessive, it\r\nkeeps the ground wet too long; and so delays cultivation; while if it be\r\ndeficient, it threatens the land with barrenness. No landowner wishes it\r\nto rise more than sixteen cubits. If the flood be moderate, then the\r\nseed sown in favourable ground sometimes returns seventy fold. The Nile,\r\ntoo, is the only river which does not cause a breeze.\r\n\r\n14. Egypt also produces many animals both terrestrial and aquatic, and\r\nsome which live both on the earth and in the water, and are therefore\r\ncalled amphibious. In the dry districts antelopes and buffaloes are\r\nfound, and sphinxes, animals of an absurd-looking deformity, and other\r\nmonsters which it is not worth while to enumerate.\r\n\r\n15. Of the terrestrial animals, the crocodile is abundant in every part\r\nof the country. This is a most destructive quadruped, accustomed to both\r\nelements, having no tongue, and moving only the upper jaw, with teeth\r\nlike a comb, which obstinately fasten into everything he can reach. He\r\npropagates his species by eggs like those of a goose.\r\n\r\n16. And as he is armed with claws, if he had only thumbs his enormous\r\nstrength would suffice to upset large vessels, for he is sometimes ten\r\ncubits long. At night he sleeps under water; in the day he feeds in the\r\nfields, trusting to the stoutness of his skin, which is so thick that\r\nmissiles from military engines will scarcely pierce the mail of his\r\nback.\r\n\r\n17. Savage as these monsters are at all other times, yet as if they had\r\nconcluded an armistice, they are always quiet, laying aside all their\r\nferocity, during the seven days of festival on which the priests at\r\nMemphis celebrate the birthday of Apis.\r\n\r\n18. Besides those which die accidentally, some are killed by wounds\r\nwhich they receive in their bellies from the dorsal fins of some fish\r\nresembling dolphins, which this river also produces.\r\n\r\n19. Some also are killed by means of a little bird called the trochilus,\r\nwhich, while seeking for some picking of small food, and flying gently\r\nabout the beast while asleep, tickles its cheeks till it comes to the\r\nneighbourhood of its throat. And when the hydrus, which is a kind of\r\nichneumon, perceives this, it penetrates into its mouth, which the bird\r\nhas caused to open, and descends into its stomach, where it devours its\r\nentrails, and then comes forth again.\r\n\r\n20. But the crocodile, though a bold beast towards those who flee, is\r\nvery timid when it finds a brave enemy. It has a most acute sight, and\r\nfor the four months of winter is said to do without food.\r\n\r\n21. The hippopotamus, also, is produced in this country; the most\r\nsagacious of all animals destitute of reason. He is like a horse, with\r\ncloven hoofs, and a short tail. Of his sagacity it will be sufficient to\r\nproduce two instances.\r\n\r\n22. The animal makes his lair among dense beds of reeds of great height,\r\nand while keeping quiet watches vigilantly for every opportunity of\r\nsallying out to feed on the crops. And when he has gorged himself, and\r\nis ready to return, he walks backwards, and makes many tracks, to\r\nprevent any enemies from following the straight road and so finding and\r\neasily killing him.\r\n\r\n23. Again, when he feels lazy from having his stomach swollen by\r\nexcessive eating, it rolls its thighs and legs on freshly-cut reeds, in\r\norder that the blood which is discharged through the wounds thus made\r\nmay relieve his fat. And then he smears his wounded flesh with clay till\r\nthe wounds get scarred over.\r\n\r\n24. This monster was very rare till it was first exhibited to the Roman\r\npeople in the ædileship of Scaurus, the father of that Scaurus whom\r\nCicero defended, when he charged the Sardinians to cherish the same\r\nopinion as the rest of the world of the authority of that noble family.\r\nSince that time, at different periods, many specimens have been brought\r\nto Rome, and now they are not to be found in Egypt, having been driven,\r\naccording to the conjecture of the inhabitants, up to the Blemmyæ[135]\r\nby being incessantly pursued by the people.\r\n\r\n25. Among the birds of Egypt, the variety of which is countless, is the\r\nibis, a sacred and amiable bird, also valuable, because by heaping up\r\nthe eggs of serpents in its nest for food it causes these fatal pests to\r\ndiminish.\r\n\r\n26. They also sometimes encounter flocks of winged snakes, which come\r\nladen with poison from the marshes of Arabia. These, before they can\r\nquit their own region, they overcome in the air, and then devour them.\r\nThis bird, we are told, produces its young through its mouth.\r\n\r\n27. Egypt also produces innumerable quantities of serpents, destructive\r\nbeyond all other creatures. Basilisks, amphisbænas,[136] scytalæ,\r\nacontiæ, dipsades, vipers, and many others. The asp is the largest and\r\nmost beautiful of all; but that never, of its own accord, quits the\r\nNile.\r\n\r\n28. There are also in this country many things exceedingly worthy of\r\nobservation, of which it is a good time now to mention a few. Everywhere\r\nthere are temples of great size. There are seven marvellous pyramids,\r\nthe difficulty of building which, and the length of time consumed in the\r\nwork, are recorded by Herodotus. They exceed in height anything ever\r\nconstructed by human labour, being towers of vast width at the bottom\r\nand ending in sharp points.\r\n\r\n29. And their shape received this name from the geometricians because\r\nthey rise in a cone like fire (+pyr+). And huge as they are, as\r\nthey taper off gradually, they throw no shadow, in accordance with a\r\nprinciple of mechanics.\r\n\r\n30. There are also subterranean passages, and winding retreats, which,\r\nit is said, men skilful in the ancient mysteries, by means of which they\r\ndivined the coming of a flood, constructed in different places lest the\r\nmemory of all their sacred ceremonies should be lost. On the walls, as\r\nthey cut them out, they have sculptured several kinds of birds and\r\nbeasts, and countless other figures of animals, which they call\r\nhieroglyphics.\r\n\r\n31. There is also Syene, where at the time of the summer solstice the\r\nrays surrounding upright objects do not allow the shadows to extend\r\nbeyond the bodies. And if any one fixes a post upright in the ground, or\r\nsees a man or a tree standing erect, he will perceive that their shadow\r\nis consumed at the extremities of their outlines. This also happens at\r\nMeroe, which is the spot in Ethiopia nearest to the equinoctial circle,\r\nand where for ninety days the shadows fall in a way just opposite to\r\nours, on account of which the natives of that district are called\r\nAntiscii.[137]\r\n\r\n32. But as there are many other wonders which would go beyond the plan\r\nof our little work, we must leave these to men of lofty genius, and\r\ncontent ourselves with relating a few things about the provinces.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI.\r\n\r\n§ 1. In former times Egypt is said to have been divided into three\r\nprovinces: Egypt proper, the Thebais, and Libya, to which in later times\r\ntwo more have been added, Augustamnica, which has been cut off from\r\nEgypt proper, and Pentapolis, which has been detached from Libya.\r\n\r\n2. Thebais, among many other cities, can boast especially of Hermopolis,\r\nCoptos, and Antinous, which Hadrian built in honour of his friend\r\nAntinous. As to Thebes, with, its hundred gates, there is no one\r\nignorant of its renown.\r\n\r\n3. In Augustamnica, among others, there is the noble city of Pelusium,\r\nwhich is said to have been founded by Peleus, the father of Achilles,\r\nwho by command of the gods was ordered to purify himself in the lake\r\nadjacent to the walls of the city, when, after having slain his brother\r\nPhocus, he was driven about by horrid images of the Furies; and Cassium,\r\nwhere the tomb of the great Pompey is, and Ostracine, and Rhinocolura.\r\n\r\n4. In Libya Pentapolis is Cyrene, a city of great antiquity, but now\r\ndeserted, founded by Battus the Spartan, and Ptolemais, and Arsinoë,\r\nknown also as Teuchira, and Darnis, and Berenice, called also\r\nHesperides.\r\n\r\n5. And in the dry Libya, besides a few other insignificant towns, there\r\nare Parætonium, Chærecla, and Neapolis.\r\n\r\n6. Egypt proper, which ever since it has been united to the Roman empire\r\nhas been under the government of a prefect, besides some other towns of\r\nsmaller importance, is distinguished by Athribis, and Oxyrynchus, and\r\nThmuis, and Memphis.\r\n\r\n7. But the greatest of all the cities is Alexandria, ennobled by many\r\ncircumstances, and especially by the grandeur of its great founder, and\r\nthe skill of its architect Dinocrates, who, when he was laying the\r\nfoundation of its extensive and beautiful walls, for want of mortar,\r\nwhich could not be procured at the moment, is said to have marked out\r\nits outline with flour; an incident which foreshowed that the city\r\nshould hereafter abound in supplies of provisions.\r\n\r\n8. At Inibis the air is wholesome, the sky pure and undisturbed; and, as\r\nthe experience of a long series of ages proves, there is scarcely ever a\r\nday on which the inhabitants of this city do not see the sun.\r\n\r\n9. The shore is shifty and dangerous; and as in former times it exposed\r\nsailors to many dangers, Cleopatra erected a lofty tower in the harbour,\r\nwhich was named Pharos, from the spot on which it was built, and which\r\nafforded light to vessels by night when coming from the Levant or the\r\nLibyan sea along the plain and level coast, without any signs of\r\nmountains or towns or eminences to direct them, they were previously\r\noften wrecked by striking into the soft and adhesive sand.\r\n\r\n10. The same queen, for a well-known and necessary reason, made a\r\ncauseway seven furlongs in extent, admirable for its size and for the\r\nalmost incredible rapidity with which it was made. The island of Pharos,\r\nwhere Homer in sublime language relates that Proteus used to amuse\r\nhimself with his herds of seals, is almost a thousand yards from the\r\nshore on which the city stands, and was liable to pay tribute to the\r\nRhodians.\r\n\r\n11. And when on one occasion the farmers of this revenue came to make\r\nexorbitant demands, she, being a wily woman, on a pretext of it being\r\nthe season of solemn holidays, led them into the suburbs, and ordered\r\nthe work to be carried on without ceasing. And so seven furlongs were\r\ncompleted in seven days, being raised with the soil of the adjacent\r\nshore. Then the queen, driving over it in her chariot, said that the\r\nRhodians were making a blunder in demanding port dues for what was not\r\nan island but part of the mainland.\r\n\r\n12. Besides this there are many lofty temples, and especially one to\r\nSerapis, which, although no words can adequately describe it, we may yet\r\nsay, from its splendid halls supported by pillars, and its beautiful\r\nstatues and other embellishments, is so superbly decorated, that next to\r\nthe Capitol, of which the ever-venerable Rome boasts, the whole world\r\nhas nothing worthier of admiration.\r\n\r\n13. In it were libraries of inestimable value; and the concurrent\r\ntestimony of ancient records affirm that 70,000 volumes, which had been\r\ncollected by the anxious care of the Ptolemies, were burnt in the\r\nAlexandrian war when the city was sacked in the time of Cæsar the\r\nDictator.\r\n\r\n14. Twelve miles from this city is Canopus, which, according to ancient\r\ntradition, received its name from the prophet of Menelaus, who was\r\nburied there. It is a place exceedingly well supplied with good inns, of\r\na most wholesome climate, with refreshing breezes; so that any one who\r\nresides in that district might think himself out of our world while he\r\nhears the breezes murmuring through the sunny atmosphere.\r\n\r\n15. Alexandria itself was not, like other cities, gradually embellished,\r\nbut at its very outset it was adorned with spacious roads. But after\r\nhaving been long torn by violent seditions, at last, when Aurelian was\r\nemperor, and when the intestine quarrels of its citizens had proceeded\r\nto deadly strife, its walls were destroyed, and it lost the largest half\r\nof its territory, which was called Bruchion, and had long been the abode\r\nof eminent men.\r\n\r\n16. There had lived Aristarchus, that illustrious grammarian; and\r\nHerodianus, that accurate inquirer into the fine arts; and Saccas\r\nAmmonius, the master of Plotinus, and many other writers in various\r\nuseful branches of literature, among whom Didymus, surnamed\r\nChalcenterus, a man celebrated for his writings on many subjects of\r\nscience, deserves especial mention; who, in the six books in which he,\r\nsometimes incorrectly, attacks Cicero, imitating those malignant farce\r\nwriters, is justly blamed by the learned as a puppy barking from a\r\ndistance with puny voice against the mighty roar of the lion.\r\n\r\n17. And although, besides those I have mentioned, there were many other\r\nmen of eminence in ancient times, yet even now there is much learning in\r\nthe same city; for teachers of various sects flourish, and many kinds of\r\nsecret knowledge are explained by geometrical science. Nor is music dead\r\namong them, nor harmony. And by a few, observations of the motion of the\r\nworld and of the stars are still cultivated; while of learned\r\narithmeticians the number is considerable; and besides them there are\r\nmany skilled in divination.\r\n\r\n18. Again, of medicine, the aid of which in our present extravagant and\r\nluxurious way of life is incessantly required, the study is carried on\r\nwith daily increasing eagerness; so that while the employment be of\r\nitself creditable, it is sufficient as a recommendation for any medical\r\nman to be able to say that he was educated at Alexandria. And this is\r\nenough to say on this subject.\r\n\r\n19. But if any one in the earnestness of his intellect wishes to apply\r\nhimself to the various branches of divine knowledge, or to the\r\nexamination of metaphysics, he will find that the whole world owes this\r\nkind of learning to Egypt.\r\n\r\n20. Here first, far earlier than in any other country, men arrived at\r\nthe various cradles (if I may so say) of different religions. Here they\r\nstill carefully preserve the elements of sacred rites as handed down in\r\ntheir secret volumes.\r\n\r\n21. It was in learning derived from Egypt that Pythagoras was educated,\r\nwhich taught him to worship the gods in secret, to establish the\r\nprinciple that in whatever he said or ordered his authority was final,\r\nto exhibit his golden thigh at Olympia, and to be continually seen in\r\nconversation with an eagle.\r\n\r\n22. Here it was that Anaxagoras derived the knowledge which enabled him\r\nto predict that stones would fall from heaven, and from the feeling of\r\nthe mud in a well to foretell impending earthquakes. Solon too derived\r\naid from the apophthegms of the priests of Egypt in the enactment of his\r\njust and moderate laws, by which he gave great confirmation to the Roman\r\njurisprudence. From this source too Plato, soaring amid sublime ideas,\r\nrivalling Jupiter himself in the magnificence of his voice, acquired\r\nhis glorious wisdom by a visit to Egypt.\r\n\r\n23. The inhabitants of Egypt are generally swarthy and dark\r\ncomplexioned, and of a rather melancholy cast of countenance, thin and\r\ndry looking, quick in every motion, fond of controversy, and bitter\r\nexactors of their rights. Among them a man is ashamed who has not\r\nresisted the payment of tribute, and who does not carry about him wheals\r\nwhich he has received before he could be compelled to pay it. Nor have\r\nany tortures been found sufficiently powerful to make the hardened\r\nrobbers of this country disclose their names unless they do so\r\nvoluntarily.\r\n\r\n24. It is well known, as the ancient annals prove, that all Egypt was\r\nformerly under kings who were friendly to us. But after Antony and\r\nCleopatra were defeated in the naval battle at Actium, it became a\r\nprovince under the dominion of Octavianus Augustus. We became masters of\r\nthe dry Libya by the last will of king Apion. Cyrene and the other\r\ncities of Libya Pentapolis we owe to the liberality of Ptolemy. After\r\nthis long digression, I will now return to my original subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n[121] Ammianus uses the phrase \"worship of _the gods_,\" in opposition to\r\nChristianity.\r\n\r\n[122] Pro Archias Poeta, cap. xxii.\r\n\r\n[123] The fable was that Hecuba was turned into a bitch, from which this\r\nplace was called +konos sêma+, a dog's tomb.\r\n\r\n[124] To--the name +Bosporos+ is derived from +Boos\r\nporos+, the passage of the Cow.\r\n\r\n[125] So Virgil calls them Indomitique Dahæ. In the Georgics, also, he\r\nspeaks of the Chalybes as producers of iron. At Chalybes nudi ferrum.\r\n\r\n[126] Or triennial, from +treis+, three; and +etos+, a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n[127] From +Dioskouroi+, the sons of Jupiter, _i.e._, Castor and\r\nPollux.\r\n\r\n[128] From +hêniochos+, a charioteer.\r\n\r\n[129] The old name was +Axeinos+, inhospitable; turned into\r\n+euxeinos+, friendly to strangers--+euêthês+, according to\r\netymology, would mean \"of a good disposition:\" +euphronê+, \"the\r\ntime when people have happy thoughts;\" +Eumenides+, \"deities of\r\npropitious might.\"\r\n\r\n[130] A people living in one of the islands near Sicily, and changed by\r\nJupiter as related, Ov. Met. xiv., into monkeys.\r\n\r\n[131] Two of the chief giants, Hom. Od. xi.\r\n\r\n[132] A time spoken of by Pliny as before the fourth watch.\r\n\r\n[133] These books are lost.\r\n\r\n[134] We must remark here Ammianus's complete ignorance of comparative\r\ngeography and the bearings of the different countries of which he\r\nspeaks. The Syrtes and Cape Ras are due _west_, not south of Egypt, The\r\nEthiopians and Catadupi are on the north; while the Arabs, whom he\r\nplaces in the same line, are on the south-east. The Sea of Issus, on the\r\nLevant, which he places on the west, is on the north.\r\n\r\n[135] The Blemmyæ were an Ethiopian tribe to the south of Egypt.\r\n\r\n[136] These names seem derived from the real or fancied shape of the\r\nsnakes mentioned: the amphisbæna, from +amph+ and +bainô+,\r\nto go both ways, as it was believed to have a head at each end. The\r\nscytalas was like \"a staff;\" the acontias, like \"a javelin;\" the dipsas\r\nwas a thirsty snake.\r\n\r\n[137] From +anti+, opposite; and +skia+, shadow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK XXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nARGUMENT.\r\n\r\n     I. Julian in vain attempts to restore the temple at Jerusalem,\r\n     which had been destroyed long before.--II. He orders Arsaces, king\r\n     of Armenia, to prepare for the war with Persia, and with an army\r\n     and auxiliary troops of the Scythians crosses the Euphrates.--III.\r\n     As he marches through Mesopotamia, the princes of the Saracenic\r\n     tribes of their own accord offer him a golden crown and auxiliary\r\n     troops--A Roman fleet of eleven hundred ships arrives, and bridges\r\n     over the Euphrates.--IV. A description of several engines, balistæ,\r\n     scorpions, or wild-asses, battering-rams, helepoles, and\r\n     fire-machines.--V. Julian, with all his army, crosses the river\r\n     Aboras by a bridge of boats at Circesium--He harangues his\r\n     soldiers.--VI. A description of the eighteen principal provinces of\r\n     Persia, their cities, and the customs of their inhabitants.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nA.D. 363.\r\n\r\n§ 1. To pass over minute details, these were the principal events of the\r\nyear. But Julian, who in his third consulship had taken as his colleague\r\nSallustius, the prefect of Gaul now entered on his fourth year, and by a\r\nnovel arrangement took as his colleague a private individual; an act of\r\nwhich no one recollected an instance since that of Diocletian and\r\nAristobulus.\r\n\r\n2. And although, foreseeing in his anxious mind the various accidents\r\nthat might happen, he urged on with great diligence all the endless\r\npreparations necessary for his expedition, yet distributing his\r\ndiligence everywhere; and being eager to extend the recollection of his\r\nreign by the greatness of his exploits, he proposed to rebuild at a vast\r\nexpense the once magnificent temple of Jerusalem, which after many\r\ndeadly contests was with difficulty taken by Vespasian and Titus, who\r\nsucceeded his father in the conduct of the siege. And he assigned the\r\ntask to Alypius of Antioch, who had formerly been proprefect of Britain.\r\n\r\n3. But though Alypius applied himself vigorously to the work, and though\r\nthe governor of the province co-operated with him, fearful balls of fire\r\nburst forth with continual eruptions close to the foundations, burning\r\nseveral of the workmen and making the spot altogether inaccessible. And\r\nthus the very elements, as if by some fate, repelling the attempt, it\r\nwas laid aside.\r\n\r\n4. About the same time the emperor conferred various honours on the\r\nambassadors who were sent to him from the Eternal City, being men of\r\nhigh rank and established excellence of character. He appointed\r\nApronianus to be prefect of Rome, Octavianus to be proconsul of Africa,\r\nVenustus to be viceroy of Spain, and promoted Rufinus Aradius to be\r\ncount of the East in the room of his uncle Julian, lately deceased.\r\n\r\n5. When all this had been carried out as he arranged, he was alarmed by\r\nan omen which, as the result showed, indicated an event immediately at\r\nhand. Felix, the principal treasurer, having died suddenly of a\r\nhemorrhage, and Count Julian having followed him, the populace, looking\r\non their public titles, hailed Julian as Felix and Augustus.\r\n\r\n6. Another bad omen had preceded this, for, on the very first day of the\r\nyear, as the emperor was mounting the steps of the temple of the Genius,\r\none of the priests, the eldest of all, fell without any one striking him\r\nand suddenly expired; an event which the bystanders, either out of\r\nignorance or a desire to flatter, affirmed was an omen affecting\r\nSallustius, as the elder consul; but it was soon seen that the death it\r\nportended was not to the elder man, but to the higher authority.\r\n\r\n7. Besides these several other lesser signs from time to time indicated\r\nwhat was about to happen; for, at the very beginning of the arrangements\r\nfor the Parthian campaign, news came that there had been an earthquake\r\nat Constantinople, which those skilful in divination declared to be an\r\nunfavourable omen to a ruler about to invade a foreign country; and\r\ntherefore advised Julian to abandon his unreasonable enterprise,\r\naffirming that these and similar signs can only be disregarded with\r\npropriety when one's country is invaded by foreign armies, as then there\r\nis one everlasting and invariable law, to defend its safety by every\r\npossible means, allowing no relaxation nor delay. News also came by\r\nletter that at Rome the Sibylline volumes had been consulted on the\r\nsubject of the war by Julian's order, and that they had in plain terms\r\nwarned him not to quit his own territories that year.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. But in the mean time embassies arrived from several nations\r\npromising aid, and they were liberally received and dismissed; the\r\nemperor with plausible confidence replying that it by no means became\r\nthe power of Rome to rely on foreign aid to avenge itself, as it was\r\nrather fitting that Rome should give support to its friends and allies\r\nif necessity drove them to ask it.\r\n\r\n2. He only warned Arsaces, king of Armenia, to collect a strong force,\r\nand wait for his orders, as he should soon know which way to march, and\r\nwhat to do. Then, as soon as prudence afforded him an opportunity,\r\nhastening to anticipate every rumour of his approach by the occupation\r\nof the enemy's country, before spring had well set in, he sent the\r\nsignal for the advance to all his troops, commanding them to cross the\r\nEuphrates.\r\n\r\n3. As soon as the order reached them, they hastened to quit their winter\r\nquarters; and having crossed the river, according to their orders, they\r\ndispersed into their various stations, and awaited the arrival of the\r\nemperor. But he, being about to quit Antioch, appointed a citizen of\r\nHeliopolis, named Alexander, a man of turbulent and ferocious character,\r\nto govern Syria, saying that he indeed had not deserved such a post, but\r\nthat the Antiochians, being covetous and insolent, required a judge of\r\nthat kind.\r\n\r\n4. When he was about to set forth, escorted by a promiscuous multitude\r\nwho wished him a fortunate march and a glorious return, praying that he\r\nwould be merciful and kinder than he had been, he (for the anger which\r\ntheir addresses and reproaches had excited in his breast was not yet\r\nappeased) spoke with severity to them, and declared that he would never\r\nsee them again.\r\n\r\n5. For he said that he had determined, after his campaign was over, to\r\nreturn by a shorter road to Tarsus in Cilicia, to winter there: and that\r\nhe had written to Memorius, the governor of the city, to prepare\r\neverything that he might require in that city. This happened not long\r\nafterwards; for his body was brought back thither and buried in the\r\nsuburbs with a very plain funeral, as he himself had commanded.\r\n\r\n6. As the weather was now getting warm he set out on the fifth of March,\r\nand by the usual stages arrived at Hieropolis; and as he entered the\r\ngates of that large city a portico on the left suddenly fell down, and\r\nas fifty soldiers were passing under it at that moment it wounded many,\r\ncrushing them beneath the vast weight of the beams and tiles.\r\n\r\n7. Having collected all his troops from thence, he marched with such\r\nspeed towards Mesopotamia, that before any intelligence of his march\r\ncould arrive (an object about which he was especially solicitous) he\r\ncame upon the Assyrians quite unexpectedly. Then having led his whole\r\narmy and the Scythian auxiliaries across the Euphrates by a bridge of\r\nboats, he arrived at Batnæ, a town of Osdroene, and there again a sad\r\nomen met him.\r\n\r\n8. For when a great crowd of grooms was standing near an enormously\r\nhigh haystack, in order to receive their forage (for in this way those\r\nsupplies used to be stored in that country), the mass was shaken by the\r\nnumbers who sought to strip it, and falling down, overwhelmed fifty men.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. Leaving this place with a heavy heart, he marched with great speed,\r\nand arrived at Carrhæ, an ancient town notorious for the disasters of\r\nCrassus and the Roman army. From this town two royal roads branch off,\r\nboth leading into Persia; that on the left hand through Adiabene and\r\nalong the Tigris, that on the right through the Assyrians and along the\r\nEuphrates.\r\n\r\n2. There he stayed some days, preparing necessary supplies; and\r\naccording to the custom of the district he offered sacrifices to the\r\nmoon, which is religiously worshipped in that region; and it is said\r\nthat while before the altar, no witness to the action being admitted, he\r\nsecretly gave his own purple robe to Procopius, and bade him boldly\r\nassume the sovereignty if he should hear that he had died among the\r\nParthians.\r\n\r\n3. Here while asleep his mind was agitated with dreams, and foresaw some\r\nsad event about to happen; on which account he and the interpreters of\r\ndreams considering the omens which presented themselves, pronounced that\r\nthe next day, which was the nineteenth of March, ought to be solemnly\r\nobserved. But, as was ascertained subsequently, that very same night,\r\nwhile Apronianus was prefect of Rome, the temple of the Palatine Apollo\r\nwas burnt in the Eternal City; and if aid from all quarters had not come\r\nto the rescue the violence of the conflagration would have destroyed\r\neven the prophetic volumes of the Sibyl.\r\n\r\n4. After these things had happened in this manner, and while Julian was\r\nsettling his line of march, and making arrangements for supplies of all\r\nkinds, his scouts come panting in, and bring him word that some\r\nsquadrons of the enemy's cavalry have suddenly passed the frontier in\r\nthe neighbourhood of the camp, and have driven off a large booty.\r\n\r\n5. Indignant at such atrocity and at such an insult, he immediately (as\r\nindeed he had previously contemplated) put thirty thousand chosen men\r\nunder the orders of Procopius, who has been already mentioned, uniting\r\nwith him in this command Count Sebastian, formerly Duke of Egypt; and he\r\nordered them to act on this side of the Tigris, observing everything\r\nvigilantly, so that no danger might arise on any side where it was not\r\nexpected, for such things had frequently happened. He charged them\r\nfurther, if it could be done, to join King Arsaces; and march with him\r\nsuddenly through Corduena and Moxoëne, ravaging Chiliocomus, a very\r\nfertile district of Media, and other places; and then to rejoin him\r\nwhile still in Assyria, in order to assist him as he might require.\r\n\r\n6. Having taken these measures, Julian himself, pretending to march by\r\nthe line of the Tigris, on which road he had purposely commanded\r\nmagazines of provisions to be prepared, turned towards the right, and\r\nafter a quiet night, asked in the morning for the horse which he was\r\naccustomed to ride: his name was Babylonius. And when he was brought,\r\nbeing suddenly griped and starting at the pain, he fell down, and\r\nrolling about scattered the gold and jewels with which his trappings\r\nwere decked. Julian, in joy at this omen, cried out, amid the applause\r\nof those around, that \"Babylon had fallen, and was stripped of all her\r\nornaments.\"\r\n\r\n7. Having delayed a little that he might confirm the omen by the\r\nsacrifice of some victims, he advanced to Davana, where he had a\r\ngarrison-fortress, and where the river Belias rises which falls into the\r\nEuphrates. Here he refreshed his men with food and sleep, and the next\r\nday reached Callinicus, a strong fortress, and also a great commercial\r\nmart, where, on the 27th of March (the day on which at Rome the annual\r\nfestival in honour of Cybele is celebrated, and the car in which her\r\nimage is borne is, as it is said, washed in the waters of the Almo), he\r\nkept the same feast according to the manner of the ancients, and then,\r\nretiring to rest, passed a triumphant, and joyful night.\r\n\r\n8. The next day he proceeded along the bank of the river, which other\r\nstreams began to augment, marching with an armed escort; and at night he\r\nrested in a tent where some princes of the Saracenic tribes came as\r\nsuppliants, bringing him a golden crown, and adoring him as the master\r\nof the world and of their own nations: he received them graciously, as\r\npeople well adapted for surprises in war.\r\n\r\n9. And while addressing them a fleet arrived equal to that of the mighty\r\nsovereign Xerxes, under the command of the tribune Constantianus, and\r\nCount Lucillianus; they threw a bridge over the broadest part of the\r\nEuphrates: the fleet consisted of one thousand transports, of various\r\nsorts and sizes, bringing large supplies of provisions, and arms, and\r\nengines for sieges, and fifty ships of war, and as many more suitable\r\nfor the construction of bridges.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n§ 1. I am reminded by the circumstances to explain instruments of this\r\nkind briefly, as far as my moderate talent may enable me to do, and\r\nfirst I will set forth the figure of the balista.\r\n\r\n2. Between two axletrees a strong large iron bar is fastened, like a\r\ngreat rule, round, smooth, and polished; from its centre a square pin\r\nprojects for some distance, hollowed out into a narrow channel down its\r\nmiddle. This is bound by many ligatures of twisted cords: to it two\r\nwooden nuts are accurately fitted, by one of which stands a skilful man\r\nwho works it, and who fits neatly into the hollow of the pin or pole a\r\nwooden arrow with a large point; and as soon as this is done, some\r\nstrong young men rapidly turn a wheel.\r\n\r\n3. When the tip of the arrow's point has reached the extremity of the\r\ncords, the arrow is struck by a blow from the balista, and flies out of\r\nsight; sometimes even giving forth sparks by its great velocity, and it\r\noften happens that before the arrow is seen, it has given a fatal wound.\r\n\r\n4. The scorpion, which they now call the wild-ass, is in the following\r\nform. Two axletrees of oak or box are cut out and slightly curved, so as\r\nto project in small humps, and they are fastened together like a sawing\r\nmachine, being perforated with large holes on each side; and between\r\nthem, through the holes, strong ropes are fastened to hold the two parts\r\ntogether, and prevent them from starting asunder.\r\n\r\n5. From these ropes thus placed a wooden pin rises in an oblique\r\ndirection, like the pole of a chariot, and it is so fastened by knotted\r\ncords as to be raised or depressed at pleasure. To its top, iron hooks\r\nare fastened, from which a sling hangs, made of either cord or iron.\r\nBelow the pin is a large sack filled with shreds of cloth, fastened by\r\nstrong ties, and resting on heaped-up turves or mounds of brick. For an\r\nengine of this kind, if placed on a stone wall would destroy whatever\r\nwas beneath it, not by its weight, but by the violence of its\r\nconcussion.\r\n\r\n6. Then when a conflict begins, a round stone is placed on the sling,\r\nand four youths on each side, loosening the bar to which the cords are\r\nattached, bend the pin back till it points almost upright into the air;\r\nthen the worker of the engine, standing by on high ground, frees by a\r\nblow with the heavy hammer the bolt which keeps down the whole engine;\r\nand the pin being set free by the stroke, and striking against the mass\r\nof cloth shreds, hurls forth the stone with such force as to crush\r\nwhatever it strikes.\r\n\r\n7. This engine is called a _tormentum_, because all its parts are\r\ntwisted (_torquetur_); or a scorpion, because it has an erect sting; but\r\nmodern times have given it the name of the wild-ass, because when wild\r\nasses are hunted, they throw the stones behind them by their kicks so as\r\nto pierce the chests of those who pursue them, or to fracture their\r\nskulls.\r\n\r\n8. Now let us come to the battering ram. A lofty pine or ash is chosen,\r\nthe top of which is armed with a long and hard head of iron, resembling\r\na ram, which form has given the name to the engine. It is suspended from\r\niron beams running across on each side, like the top of a pair of\r\nscales, and is kept in its place by ropes hanging from a third beam. A\r\nnumber of men draw it back as far as there is room, and then again drive\r\nit forward to break down whatever opposes it by mighty blows, like a ram\r\nwhich rises up and butts.\r\n\r\n9. By the frequent blows of this rebounding thunderbolt, buildings are\r\ntorn asunder and walls are loosened and thrown down. By this kind of\r\nengine, if worked with proper vigour, garrisons are deprived of their\r\ndefences, and the strongest cities are laid open and sieges rapidly\r\nbrought to a conclusion.\r\n\r\n10. Instead of these rams, which from their common use came to be\r\ndespised, a machine was framed called in Greek the helepolis, by the\r\nfrequent use of which Demetrius, the son of king Antigonus, took Rhodes\r\nand other cities, and earned the surname of Poliorcetes.\r\n\r\n11. It is constructed in this manner. A vast testudo is put together,\r\nstrengthened with long beams and fastened with iron nails; it is covered\r\nwith bullocks' hides and wicker-work made of freshly cut twigs, and its\r\ntop is smeared over with clay to keep off missiles and fiery darts.\r\n\r\n12. Along its front very sharp spears with three points are fastened,\r\nheavy with iron, like the thunderbolts represented by painters or\r\nsculptors, and strong enough with the projecting points to tear to\r\npieces whatever it strikes.\r\n\r\n13. A number of soldiers within guide this vast mast with wheels and\r\nropes, urging with vehement impulse against the weaker parts of the\r\nwall, so that, unless repelled by the strength of the garrison above, it\r\nbreaks down the wall and lays open a great breach.\r\n\r\n14. The firebolts, which are a kind of missile, are made thus. They take\r\nan arrow of cane, joined together between the point and the reed with\r\njagged iron, and made in the shape of a woman's spindle, with which\r\nlinen threads are spun; this is cunningly hollowed out in the belly and\r\nmade with several openings, and in the cavity fire and fuel of some kind\r\nis placed.\r\n\r\n15. Then if it be shot slowly from a slack bow (for if it be shot with\r\ntoo much speed the fire is extinguished), so as to stick anywhere, it\r\nburns obstinately, and if sprinkled with water it creates a still\r\nfiercer fire, nor will anything but throwing dust upon it quench it.\r\nThis is enough to say of mural engines; let us now return to our\r\noriginal subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n§ 1. Having received the reinforcements of the Saracens which they so\r\ncheerfully offered, the emperor advanced with speed, and at the\r\nbeginning of April entered Circesium, a very secure fortress, and\r\nskilfully built, it is surrounded by the two rivers Aboras (or Chaboras)\r\nand Euphrates, which make it as it were an island.\r\n\r\n2. It had formerly been small and insecure, till Diocletian surrounded\r\nit with lofty towers and walls when he was strengthening his inner\r\nfrontier within the very territories of the barbarians, in order to\r\nprevent the Persians from overrunning Syria, as had happened a few years\r\nbefore to the great injury of the province.\r\n\r\n3. For it happened one day at Antioch, when the city was in perfect\r\ntranquillity, a comic actor being on the stage with his wife, acting\r\nsome common play, while the people were delighted with his acting, the\r\nwife suddenly exclaimed, \"Unless I am dreaming, here are the Persians;\"\r\nand immediately the populace turning round, were put to flight, and\r\ndriven about in every direction while seeking to escape the darts which\r\nwere showered upon them; and so the city being burnt and numbers of the\r\ncitizens slain, who, as is usual in time of peace, were strolling about\r\ncarelessly, and all the places in the neighbourhood being burnt and laid\r\nwaste, the enemy loaded with booty returned in safety to their own\r\ncountry after having burnt Mareades alive, who had wickedly guided them\r\nto the destruction of his fellow-citizens. This event took place in the\r\ntime of Gallienus.\r\n\r\n4. But Julian, while remaining at Circesium to give time for his army\r\nand all its followers to cross the bridge of boats over the Aboras,\r\nreceived letters with bad news from Sallust, the prefect of Gaul,\r\nentreating him to suspend his expedition against the Parthians, and\r\nimploring him not in such an unseasonable manner to rush on irrevocable\r\ndestruction before propitiating the gods.\r\n\r\n5. But Julian disregarded his prudent adviser, and advanced boldly;\r\nsince no human power or virtue can ever avail to prevent events\r\nprescribed by the order of the Fates. And immediately, having crossed\r\nthe river, he ordered the bridge to be taken to pieces, that the\r\nsoldiers might have no hope of safety by quitting their ranks and\r\nreturning.\r\n\r\n6. Here also a bad omen was seen; the corpse of an officer who had been\r\nput to death by the executioner, whom Sallust, the prefect, while in\r\nthis country had condemned to death, because, after having promised to\r\ndeliver an additional supply of provisions by an appointed day, he\r\ndisappointed him through some hindrance. But after the unhappy man had\r\nbeen executed, the very next day there arrived, as he had promised,\r\nanother fleet heavily laden with corn.\r\n\r\n7. Leaving Circesium, we came to Zaitha, the name of the place meaning\r\nan olive-tree. Here we saw the tomb of the emperor Gordian, which is\r\nvisible a long way off, whose actions from his earliest youth, and whose\r\nmost fortunate campaigns and treacherous murder we related at the proper\r\ntime,[138] and when, in accordance with his innate piety he had offered\r\ndue honours to this deified emperor and was on his way to Dura, a town\r\nnow deserted, he stood without moving on beholding a large body of\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\n8. And as he was doubting what their object was, they brought him an\r\nenormous lion which had attacked their ranks and had been slain by their\r\njavelins. He, elated at this circumstance, which he looked on as an omen\r\nof success in his enterprise, advanced with increased exultation; but so\r\nuncertain is fortune, the event was quite contrary to his expectation.\r\nThe death of a king was certainly foreshown, but who was the king was\r\nuncertain.\r\n\r\n9. For we often read of ambiguous oracles, never understood till the\r\nresults interpreted them; as, for instance, the Delphic prophecy, which\r\nforetold that after crossing the Halys, Croesus would overthrow a\r\nmighty kingdom; and another, which by hints pointed out the sea to the\r\nAthenians as the field of combat against the Medes; and another; later\r\nthan these, but not less ambiguous:--\r\n\r\n                    \"O son of Æacus,\r\n  I say that you the Romans can subdue.\"\r\n\r\n10. The Etrurian soothsayers who accompanied him, being men skilful in\r\nportents, had often warned him against this campaign, but got no credit;\r\nso now they produced their books of such signs, and showed that this was\r\nan omen of a forbidding character, and unfavourable to a prince who\r\nshould invade the country of another sovereign however justly.\r\n\r\n11. But he spurned the opposition of philosophers, whose authority he\r\nought to have reverenced, though at times they were mistaken, and though\r\nthey were sometimes obstinate in cases which they did not thoroughly\r\nunderstand. In truth, they brought forward as a plausible argument to\r\nsecure credit to their knowledge, that in time past, when Cæsar\r\nMaximianus was about to fight Narses, king of the Persians, a lion and a\r\nhuge boar which had been slain were at the same time brought to him, and\r\nafter subduing that nation he returned in safety; forgetting that the\r\ndestruction which was now portended was to him who invaded the dominions\r\nof another, and that Narses had given the offence by being the first to\r\nmake an inroad into Armenia, a country under the Roman jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n12. On the next day, which was the 7th of April, as the sun was setting,\r\nsuddenly the air became darkened, and all light wholly disappeared, and\r\nafter repeated claps of thunder and flashes of lightning, a soldier\r\nnamed Jovianus was struck by the lightning and killed, with two horses\r\nwhich he was leading back from the river to which he had taken them to\r\ndrink.\r\n\r\n13. When this was seen, the interpreters of such things were sent for\r\nand questioned, and they with increased boldness affirmed that this\r\nevent forbade the campaign, demonstrating it to be a monitory lightning\r\n(for this term is applied to signs which advise or discourage any line\r\nof action). And this, as they said, was to be the more guarded against,\r\nbecause it had killed a soldier of rank, with war-horses; and the books\r\nwhich explain lightnings pronounce that places struck in this manner\r\nshould not be trodden on, nor even looked upon.\r\n\r\n14. On the other hand, the philosophers declared that the brilliancy of\r\nthis sacred fire thus suddenly presented to the eye had no special\r\nmeaning, but was merely the course of a fiercer breath descending by\r\nsome singular power from the sky to the lower parts of the world; and\r\nthat if any foreknowledge were to be derived from such a circumstance,\r\nit was rather an increase of renown which was portended to the emperor\r\nnow engaged in a glorious enterprise; since it is notorious that flame,\r\nif it meet with no obstacle, does of its own nature fly upwards.\r\n\r\n15. The bridge then, as has been narrated, having been finished, and all\r\nthe troops having crossed it, the emperor thought it the most important\r\nof all things to address his soldiers who were advancing resolutely, in\r\nfull reliance on their leader and on themselves. Accordingly, a signal\r\nhaving been given by the trumpets, the centurions, cohorts, and maniples\r\nassembled, and he, standing on a mound of earth, and surrounded by a\r\nring of officers of high rank, spoke thus with a cheerful face, being\r\nfavourably heard with the unanimous good will of all present.\r\n\r\n16. \"Seeing, my brave soldiers, that you are full of great vigour and\r\nalacrity, I have determined to address you, to prove to you by several\r\narguments that the Romans are not, as spiteful grumblers assert, now for\r\nthe first time invading the kingdom of Persia. For, to say nothing of\r\nLucullus or of Pompey, who, having forced his way through the Albani and\r\nMassagetæ, whom we call Alani, penetrated through this nation also so as\r\nto reach the Caspian lake; we know that Ventidius, the lieutenant of\r\nAntony, gained many victories in these regions.\r\n\r\n17. \"But to leave those ancient times, I will enumerate other exploits\r\nof more recent memory. Trajan, and Verus, and Severus have all gained\r\nvictories and trophies in this country; and the younger Gordian, whose\r\nmonument we have just been honouring, would have reaped similar glory,\r\nhaving conquered and routed the king of Persia at Resaina, if he had not\r\nbeen wickedly murdered in this very place by the faction of Philip, the\r\nprefect of the prætorium, with the assistance of a few other impious\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n18. \"But his shade was not long left to wander unavenged, since, as if\r\nJustice herself had laboured in the cause, all those who conspired\r\nagainst him have been put to death with torture. Those men, indeed,\r\nambition prompted to the atrocious deed; but we are exhorted by the\r\nmiserable fate of cities recently taken, by the unavenged shades of our\r\nslaughtered armies, by the heaviness of our losses, and the loss of many\r\ncamps and fortresses, to the enterprise which we have undertaken. All\r\nmen uniting in their wishes that we may remedy past evils, and having\r\nsecured the honour and safety of the republic on this side, may leave\r\nposterity reason to speak nobly of us.\r\n\r\n19. \"By the assistance of the eternal deity, I, your emperor, will be\r\nalways among you as a leader and a comrade, relying, as I well believe,\r\non favourable omens. But if variable fortune shall defeat me in battle,\r\nit will still be sufficient for me to have devoted myself for the\r\nwelfare of the Roman world, like ancient Curtii and Mucii, and the\r\nillustrious family of the Decii. We have to abolish a most pernicious\r\nnation, on whose swords the blood of our kindred is not yet dry.\r\n\r\n20. \"Our ancestors have before now devoted ages to cause the\r\ndestruction of enemies who harassed them. Carthage was overthrown after\r\na long and distressing war; and its great conqueror feared to let it\r\nsurvive his victory. After a long and often disastrous siege, Scipio\r\nutterly destroyed Numantia. Rome destroyed Fidenæ, that it might not\r\ngrow up as a rival to the empire; and so entirely laid waste Falisci and\r\nVeii, that it is not easy to attach so much faith to ancient records as\r\nto believe that those cities ever were powerful.\r\n\r\n21. \"These transactions I have related to you as one acquainted with\r\nancient history. It follows that all should lay aside, as unworthy of\r\nhim, the love of plunder, which has often been the insidious bane of the\r\nRoman soldier, and that every one should keep steadily to his own troop\r\nand his own standard, when the necessity for fighting arises, knowing\r\nthat should he loiter anywhere he will be hamstrung and left to his\r\nfate. I fear nothing of our over-crafty enemies but their tricks and\r\nperfidy.\r\n\r\n22. \"Finally, I promise you all, that when our affairs have met with\r\nsuccess, without entrenching myself behind my imperial prerogative, so\r\nas to consider all my own decisions and opinions irrefragably just and\r\nreasonable because of my authority, I will give, if required, a full\r\nexplanation of all that I have done, that you may be able to judge\r\nwhether it has been wise or not.\r\n\r\n23. \"Therefore, I entreat you, now summon all your courage, in full\r\nreliance on your good fortune, sure at all events that I will share all\r\ndangers equally with you, and believing that victory ever accompanies\r\njustice.\"\r\n\r\n24. When he had ended his harangue with this pleasant peroration, the\r\nsoldiers, exulting in the glory of their chief, and elated with the\r\nhopes of success, lifted up their shields on high, and cried out that\r\nthey should think nothing dangerous nor difficult under an emperor who\r\nimposed more toil on himself than on his common soldiers.\r\n\r\n25. And above all the rest his Gallic troops showed this feeling with\r\ntriumphant shouts, remembering how often while he as their leader was\r\nmarshalling their ranks, they had seen some nations defeated and others\r\ncompelled to sue for mercy and peace.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n§ 1. Our history here leads us to a digression explanatory of the\r\nsituation of Persia. It has been already dilated upon by those who\r\ndescribe different nations, though but few of them have given a correct\r\naccount; if my story should be a little longer, it will contribute to a\r\nbetter knowledge of the country. For whoever affects excessive\r\nconciseness while speaking of things but little known, does not so much\r\nconsider how to explain matters intelligibly, as how much he may omit.\r\n\r\n2. This kingdom, formerly but small, and one which had been known by\r\nseveral names, from causes which we have often mentioned, after the\r\ndeath of Alexander at Babylon received the name of Parthia from Arsaces,\r\na youth of obscure birth, who in his early youth was a leader of\r\nbanditti, but who gradually improved his condition, and rose to high\r\nrenown from his illustrious actions.\r\n\r\n3. After many splendid and gallant exploits he defeated Nicator\r\nSeleucus, the successor of the above-named Alexander, who had received\r\nthe surname of Nicator[139] from his repeated victories; and having\r\nexpelled the Macedonian garrisons, he lived for the remainder of his\r\nlife in peace, like a merciful ruler of willing subjects.\r\n\r\n4. At last, after all the neighbouring districts had been brought under\r\nhis power, either by force or by fear, or by his reputation for justice,\r\nhe died a peaceful death in middle age, after he had filled all Persia\r\nwith flourishing cities and well-fortified camps and fortresses, and had\r\nmade it an object of terror to its neighbours whom previously it used to\r\nfear. And he was the first of these kings who had by the unanimous\r\nconsent of all his countrymen of all ranks, in accordance with the\r\ntenets of their religion, had his memory consecrated as one now placed\r\namong the stars.\r\n\r\n5. And it is from his era that the arrogant sovereigns of that nation\r\nhave allowed themselves to be entitled brothers of the sun and moon.\r\nAnd, as the title of Augustus is sought for and desired by our emperors,\r\nso now the additional dignities first earned by the fortunate auspices\r\nof Arsaces are claimed by all the Parthian kings, who were formerly\r\nabject and inconsiderable.\r\n\r\n6. So that they still worship and honour Arsaces as a god, and down to\r\nour day have given him so much honour that, in conferring the royal\r\npower, one of his race has been always preferred to any one else. And\r\nalso in intestine quarrels, such as are common in that nation, every one\r\navoids as sacrilege wounding any descendant of Arsaces, whether in arms\r\nor living as a private individual.\r\n\r\n7. It is well known that this nation, after subduing many others by\r\nforce, extended its dominions as far as the Propontis and Thrace; but\r\nthat it subsequently became diminished and suffered great disasters,\r\nowing to the arrogance of its ambitious monarchs, who carried their\r\nlicentious inroads into distant countries. First, in consequence of the\r\nconduct of Cyrus, who crossed the Bosphorus with a fabulous host, but\r\nwas wholly destroyed by Tomyris, queen of the Scythians, who thus\r\nterribly avenged her sons.\r\n\r\n8. After him, when Darius, and subsequently Xerxes, changed the use[140]\r\nof the elements and invaded Greece, they had nearly all their forces\r\ndestroyed by land and sea, and could scarcely escape in safety\r\nthemselves. I say nothing of the wars of Alexander, and of his leaving\r\nthe sovereignty over the whole nation by will to his successor.\r\n\r\n9. Then, a long time after these events, while our republic was under\r\nconsuls, and was afterwards brought under the power of the Cæsars, that\r\nnation was constantly warring with us, sometimes with equal fortune;\r\nbeing at one time defeated, and at another victorious.\r\n\r\n10. Now I will in a few words describe the situation and position of the\r\ncountry as well as I can. It is a region of great extent both in length\r\nand breadth, entirely surrounding on all sides the famous Persian gulf\r\nwith its many islands. The mouth of this gulf is so narrow that from\r\nHarmozon, the promontory of Carmania, the opposite headland, which the\r\nnatives call Maces, is easily seen.\r\n\r\n11. When the strait between these capes is passed, and the water becomes\r\nwider, they are navigable up to the city Teredon, where, after having\r\nsuffered a great diminution of its waters, the Euphrates falls into the\r\nsea. The entire gulf, if measured round the shore, is 20,000 furlongs,\r\nbeing of a circular form as if turned in a lathe. And all round its\r\ncoasts are towns and villages in great numbers; and the vessels which\r\nnavigate its waters are likewise very numerous.\r\n\r\n12. Having then passed through this strait we come to the gulf of\r\nArmenia on the east, the gulf of Cantichus on the south, and on the west\r\nto a third, which they call Chalites.[141] These gulfs, after washing\r\nmany islands, of which but few are known, join the great Indian Ocean,\r\nwhich is the first to receive the glowing rising of the sun, and is\r\nitself of an excessive heat.\r\n\r\n13. As the pens of geographers delineate it, the whole of the region\r\nwhich we have been speaking of is thus divided. From the north to the\r\nCaspian gates it borders on the Cadusii, and on many Scythian tribes,\r\nand on the Arimaspi, a fierce one-eyed people. On the west it is bounded\r\nby the Armenians, and Mount Niphates, the Asiatic Albani, the Red Sea,\r\nand the Scenite Arabs, whom later times have called the Saracens. To the\r\nsouth it looks towards Mesopotamia, on the east it reaches to the\r\nGanges, which falls into the Southern Ocean after intersecting the\r\ncountries of the Indians.\r\n\r\n14. The principal districts of Persia, under command of the Vitaxæ, that\r\nis to say of the generals of the cavalry, and of the king's Satraps, for\r\nthe many inferior provinces it would be difficult and superfluous to\r\nenumerate, are Assyria, Susiana, Media, Persia, Parthia, the greater\r\nCarmania, Hyrcania, Margiana, the Bactrians, the Sogdians, the Sacæ,\r\nScythia beyond Mount Emodes, Serica, Aria, the Paropanisadæ, Drangiana,\r\nArachosia, and Gedrosia.\r\n\r\n15. Superior to all the rest is that which is the nearest to us,\r\nAssyria, both in renown, and extent, and its varied riches and\r\nfertility. It was formerly divided among several peoples and tribes, but\r\nis now known under one common name as Assyria. It is in that country\r\nthat amid its abundance of fruits and ordinary crops, there is a lake\r\nnamed Sosingites, near which bitumen is found. In this lake the Tigris\r\nis for a while absorbed, flowing beneath its bed, till, at a great\r\ndistance, it emerges again.\r\n\r\n16. Here also is produced naphtha, an article of a pitchy and glutinous\r\ncharacter, resembling bitumen: on which if ever so small a bird perches,\r\nit finds its flight impeded and speedily dies. It is a species of\r\nliquid, and when once it has taken fire, human ingenuity can find no\r\nmeans of extinguishing it except that of heaping dust on it.\r\n\r\n17. In the same district is seen an opening in the earth from which a\r\ndeadly vapour arises, which by its foul odour destroys any animal which\r\ncomes near it. The evil arises from a deep well, and if that odour\r\nspread beyond its wide mouth before it rose higher, it would make all\r\nthe country around uninhabitable by its fetid effect.\r\n\r\n18. There used, as some affirm, to be a similar chasm near Hierapolis in\r\nPhrygia; from which a noxious vapour rose in like manner with a fetid\r\nsmell which never ceased, and destroyed everything within the reach of\r\nits influence, except eunuchs; to what this was owing we leave natural\r\nphilosophers to determine.\r\n\r\n19. Also near the temple of the Asbamæan Jupiter, in Cappadocia (in\r\nwhich district that eminent philosopher Apollonius is said to have been\r\nborn near the town of Tyana), a spring rises from a marsh, which,\r\nhowever swollen with its rising floods, never overflows its banks.\r\n\r\n20. Within this circuit is Adiabene, which was formerly called Assyria,\r\nbut by long custom has received its present name from the circumstance,\r\nthat being placed between the two navigable rivers the Ona and the\r\nTigris, it can never be approached by fording; for in Greek we use\r\n+diabainein+ for to \"cross:\" this was the belief of the ancients.\r\n\r\n21. But we say that in this country there are two rivers which never\r\nfail, which we ourselves have crossed, the Diabas, and the Adiabas:\r\nboth having bridges of boats over them; and that Adiabene has received\r\nits name from this last, as Homer tells us Egypt received its name from\r\nits great river, and India also, and Commagena which was formerly called\r\nEuphratensis, as did the country now called Spain, which was formerly\r\ncalled Iberia from the Iberus.[142] And the great Spanish province of\r\nBoetica from the river Boetis.[143]\r\n\r\n22. In this district of Adiabene is the city of Nineveh, named after\r\nNinus, a most mighty sovereign of former times, and the husband of\r\nSemiramis, who was formerly queen of Persia, and also the cities of\r\nEcbatana, Arbela, and Gaugamela, where Alexander, after several other\r\nbattles, gave the crowning defeat to Darius.\r\n\r\n23. In Assyria there are many cities, among which one of the most\r\neminent is Apamia, surnamed Mesene, and Teredon, and Apollonia, and\r\nVologesia, and many others of equal importance. But the most splendid\r\nand celebrated are these three, Babylon, the walls of which Semiramis\r\ncemented with pitch; for its citadel indeed was founded by that most\r\neminent monarch Belus. And Ctesiphon which Vardanes built long ago, and\r\nwhich subsequently King Pacorus enlarged by an immigration of many\r\ncitizens, fortifying it also with walls, and giving it a name, made it\r\nthe most splendid place in Persia--next to it Seleucia, the splendid\r\nwork of Seleucus Nicator.\r\n\r\n24. This, however, as we have already related, was stormed by the\r\ngenerals of Verus Cæsar, who carried the image of the Cumæan Apollo to\r\nRome, and placed it in the temple of the Palatine Apollo, where it was\r\nformally dedicated to that god by his priests. But it is said that after\r\nthis statue was carried off, and the city was burnt, the soldiers,\r\nsearching the temple, found a narrow hole, and when this was opened in\r\nthe hope of finding something of value in it, from some deep gulf which\r\nthe secret science of the Chaldæans had closed up, issued a pestilence,\r\nloaded with the force of incurable disease, which in the time of Verus\r\nand Marcus Antoninus polluted the whole world from the borders of Persia\r\nto the Rhine and Gaul with contagion and death.\r\n\r\n25. Near to this is the region of the Chaldæans, the nurse of the\r\nancient philosophy, as the Chaldæans themselves affirm; and where the\r\nart of true divination has most especially been conspicuous. This\r\ndistrict is watered by the noble rivers already mentioned, by the\r\nMarses, by the Royal river, and by that best of all, the Euphrates,\r\nwhich divides into three branches, and is navigable in them all, having\r\nmany islands, and irrigating the fields around in a manner superior to\r\nany industry of cultivators, making them fit both for the plough and for\r\nthe production of trees.\r\n\r\n26. Next to these come the Susians, in whose province there are not many\r\ntowns; though Susa itself is celebrated as a city which has often been\r\nthe home of kings, and Arsiana, and Sele, and Aracha. The other towns in\r\nthis district are unimportant and obscure. Many rivers flow through this\r\nregion, the chief of which are the Oroates, the Harax, and the Meseus,\r\npassing through the narrow sandy plain which separates the Caspian from\r\nthe Red Sea, and then fall into the sea.\r\n\r\n27. On the left, Media is bounded by the Hyrcanian Sea;[144] a country\r\nwhich, before the reign of the elder Cyrus and the rise of Persia, we\r\nread was the supreme mistress of all Asia after the Assyrians had been\r\nconquered; the greater part of whose cantons had their name changed into\r\none general appellation of Acrapatena, and fell by right of war under\r\nthe power of the Medes.\r\n\r\n28. They are a warlike nation, and the most formidable of all the\r\neastern tribes, next to the Parthians, by whom alone they are conquered.\r\nThe region which they inhabit is in the form of a square. All the\r\ninhabitants of these districts extend over great breadth of country,\r\nreaching to the foot of a lofty chain of mountains known by the names of\r\nZagrus, Orontes, and Jasonium.\r\n\r\n29. There is another very lofty mountain called Coronus; and those who\r\ndwell on its western side abound in corn land and vineyards, being\r\nblessed with a most fertile soil, and one enriched by rivers and\r\nfountains.\r\n\r\n30. They have also green meadows, and breeds of noble horses, on which\r\n(as ancient writers relate, and as we ourselves have witnessed) their\r\nmen when going to battle mount with great exultation. They call them\r\nNesæi.[145]\r\n\r\n31. They have also as many cities as Media, and villages as strongly\r\nbuilt as towns in other countries, inhabited by large bodies of\r\ncitizens. In short, it is the richest quarter of the kingdom.\r\n\r\n32. In these districts the lands of the Magi are fertile; and it may be\r\nas well to give a short account of that sect and their studies, since we\r\nhave occasion to mention their name. Plato, that most learned deliverer\r\nof wise opinions, teaches us that Magiæ is by a mystic name\r\nMachagistia,[146] that is to say, the purest worship of divine beings;\r\nof which knowledge in olden times the Bactrian Zoroaster derived much\r\nfrom the secret rites of the Chaldæans; and after him Hystaspes, a very\r\nwise monarch, the father of Darius.\r\n\r\n33. Who while boldly penetrating into the remoter districts of upper\r\nIndia, came to a certain woody retreat, of which with its tranquil\r\nsilence the Brahmans, men of sublime genius, were the possessors. From\r\ntheir teaching he learnt the principles of the motion of the world and\r\nof the stars, and the pure rites of sacrifice, as far as he could; and\r\nof what he learnt he infused some portion into the minds of the Magi,\r\nwhich they have handed down by tradition to later ages, each instructing\r\nhis own children, and adding to it their own system of divination.\r\n\r\n34. From his time, through many ages to the present era, a number of\r\npriests of one and the same race has arisen, dedicated to the worship of\r\nthe gods. And they say, if it can be believed, that they even keep alive\r\nin everlasting fires a flame which descended from heaven among them; a\r\nsmall portion of which, as a favourable omen, used to be borne before\r\nthe kings of Asia.\r\n\r\n35. Of this class the number among the ancients was small, and the\r\nPersian sovereigns employed their ministry in the solemn performance of\r\ndivine sacrifices, and it was profanation to approach the altars, or to\r\ntouch a victim before a Magus with solemn prayers had poured over it a\r\npreliminary libation. But becoming gradually more numerous they arrived\r\nat the dignity and reputation of a substantial race; inhabiting towns\r\nprotected by no fortifications, allowed to live by their own laws, and\r\nhonoured from the regard borne to their religion.\r\n\r\n36. It was of this race of Magi that the ancient volumes relate that\r\nafter the death of Cambyses, seven men seized on the kingdom of Persia,\r\nwho were put down by Darius, after he obtained the kingdom through the\r\nneighing of his horse.\r\n\r\n37. In this district a medical oil is prepared with which if an arrow be\r\nsmeared, and it be shot gently from a loose bow (for it loses its effect\r\nin a rapid flight), wherever it sticks it burns steadily, and if any one\r\nattempts to quench it with water it only burns more fiercely, nor can it\r\nbe put out by any means except by throwing dust on it.\r\n\r\n38. It is made in this manner. Those skilful in such arts mix common oil\r\nwith a certain herb, keep it a long time and when the mixture is\r\ncompleted they thicken it with a material derived from some natural\r\nsource, like a thicker oil. The material being a liquor produced in\r\nPersia, and called, as I have already said, naphtha in their native\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\n39. In this district there are many cities, the most celebrated of which\r\nare Zombis, Patigran, and Gazaca; but the richest and most strongly\r\nfortified are Heraclia, Arsacia, Europos, Cyropolis, and Ecbatana, all\r\nof which are situated in the Syromedian region at the foot of Mount\r\nJasonius.\r\n\r\n40. There are many rivers in this country, the principal of which are\r\nthe Choaspes, the Gyndes, the Amardus, the Charinda, the Cambyses, and\r\nthe Cyrus, to which, on account of its size and beauty, the elder Cyrus,\r\nthat amiable king, gave its present name, abolishing that which it used\r\nto bear, when he was proceeding on his expedition against Scythia; his\r\nreason being that it was strong, as he accounted himself to be, and that\r\nmaking its way with great violence, as he proposed to do, it falls into\r\nthe Caspian Sea.\r\n\r\n41. Beyond this frontier ancient Persia, stretching towards the south,\r\nextends as far as the sea, and is very thickly peopled, being also rich\r\nin grain and date-trees, and well supplied with excellent water. Many of\r\nits rivers fall into the gulf already mentioned, the chief of which are\r\nthe Vatrachites, the Rogomanis, the Brisoana, and the Bagrada.\r\n\r\n42. Its inland towns are very considerable; it is uncertain why they\r\nbuilt nothing remarkable on the sea-coast. Those of most note are\r\nPersepolis, Ardea, Obroatis, and Tragonice. The only islands visible\r\nfrom that coast are these:--Tabiana, Fara, and Alexandria.\r\n\r\n43. On the borders of this ancient Persia towards the north is Parthia,\r\na country subject to snow and frost; the principal river which\r\nintersects that region is the Choatres; the chief towns are Genonia,\r\nMoesia, Charax, Apamia, Artacana, and Hecatompylos; from its frontier\r\nalong the shores of the Caspian Sea to the Caspian gates is a distance\r\nof 1040 furlongs.\r\n\r\n44. The inhabitants of all the countries in that district are fierce and\r\nwarlike, and they are so fond of war and battle that he who is slain in\r\nbattle is accounted the happiest of men, while those who die a natural\r\ndeath are reproached as degenerate and cowardly.\r\n\r\n45. These tribes are bounded on the east and the south by Arabia Felix,\r\nso called because it abounds equally in corn, cattle, vines, and every\r\nkind of spice: a great portion of that country reaches on the right down\r\nto the Red Sea, and on its left extends to the Persian Gulf; so that the\r\ninhabitants reap the benefits of both.\r\n\r\n46. There are in that country many havens and secure harbours, and\r\nwell-frequented marts; many spacious and splendid abodes for their\r\nkings, and wholesome springs of water naturally warm, and a great number\r\nof rivers and streams; the climate is temperate and healthy, so that if\r\none considers the matter rightly, the natives seem to want nothing to\r\nperfect their happiness.\r\n\r\n47. There are in it very many cities both on the coast and inland; many\r\nfertile hills and valleys. The chief cities are Geapolis, Nascon,\r\nBaraba, Nagara, Mephra, Taphra, and Dioscurias. And in both seas it\r\npossesses several islands lying off the coast, which it is not worth\r\nwhile to enumerate. But the most important of them is Turgana, in which\r\nthere is said to be a magnificent temple of Serapis.\r\n\r\n48. Beyond the frontier of this nation is the greater Carmania, lying on\r\nhigh ground, and stretching to the Indian Sea; fertile in fruit and\r\ntimber trees, but neither so productive nor so extensive as Arabia. With\r\nrivers it is as well supplied, and in grass and herbage scarcely\r\ninferior.\r\n\r\n49. The most important rivers are the Sagareus, the Saganis, and the\r\nHydriacus. The cities are not numerous, but admirably supplied with all\r\nthe necessaries and luxuries of life; the most celebrated of them all\r\nare Carmania the metropolis, Portospana, Alexandria, and Hermopolis.\r\n\r\n50. Proceeding inland, we next come to the Hyrcanians, who live on the\r\ncoast of the sea of that name. Here the land is so poor that it kills\r\nthe seed crops, so that agriculture is not much attended to; but they\r\nlive by hunting, taking wonderful pleasure in every kind of sport.\r\nThousands of tigers are found among them, and all kinds of wild beasts;\r\nwe have already mentioned the various devices by which they are caught.\r\n\r\n51. Not indeed that they are ignorant of the art of ploughing, and some\r\ndistricts where the soil is fertile are regularly sown; nor are trees\r\nwanting to plant in suitable spots: many of the people too support\r\nthemselves by commerce.\r\n\r\n52. In this province are two rivers of universal celebrity the Oxus and\r\nthe Maxera, which tigers sometimes, when urged by hunger, cross by\r\nswimming, and unexpectedly ravage the neighbouring districts. It has\r\nalso besides other smaller towns some strong cities, two on the\r\nsea-shore named Socunda and Saramanna; and some inland, such as Azmorna\r\nand Sole, and Hyrcana, of higher reputation than either.\r\n\r\n53. Opposite to this tribe, towards the north, live the Abii, a very\r\ndevout nation, accustomed to trample under foot all worldly things, and\r\nwhom, as Homer somewhat fabulously says, Jupiter keeps in view from\r\nMount Ida.\r\n\r\n54. The regions next to the Hyrcaneans are possessed by the Margiani,\r\nwhose district is almost wholly surrounded by high hills, by which they\r\nare separated from the sea; and although the greater part of this\r\nprovince is deserted from want of water, still there are some towns in\r\nit; the best known of which are Jasonium, Antiochia, and Nisæa.\r\n\r\n55. Next to them are the Bactrians, a nation formerly very warlike and\r\npowerful, and always hostile to the Persians, till they drew all the\r\nnations around under their dominion, and united them under their own\r\nname; and in old time the Bactrian kings were formidable even to\r\nArsaces.\r\n\r\n56. The greater part of their country, like that of the Margiani, is\r\nsituated far from the sea-shore, but its soil is fertile, and the cattle\r\nwhich feed both on the plains and on the mountains in that district are\r\nvery large and powerful; of this the camels which Mithridates brought\r\nfrom thence, and which were first seen by the Romans at the siege of\r\nCyzicus, are a proof.\r\n\r\n57. Many tribes are subject to the Bactrians, the most considerable of\r\nwhich are the Tochari: their country is like Italy in the number of its\r\nrivers, some of which are the Artemis and the Zariaspes, which were\r\nformerly joined, and the Ochus and Orchomanes, which also unite and\r\nafterwards fall into the Oxus, and increase that large river with their\r\nstreams.\r\n\r\n58. There are also cities in that country, many of them on the border of\r\ndifferent rivers, the best of which are Chatra, Charte, Alicodra,\r\nAstacea, Menapila, and Bactra itself, which has given its name both to\r\nthe region and to the people.\r\n\r\n59. At the foot of the mountains lie a people called the Sogdians, in\r\nwhose country are two rivers navigable for large vessels, the Araxates\r\nand the Dymas, which, flowing among the hills and through the valleys\r\ninto the open plain, form the extensive Oxian marsh. In this district\r\nthe most celebrated towns are Alexandria, Cyreschata, and Drepsa the\r\nmetropolis.\r\n\r\n60. Bordering on these are the Sacæ, a fierce nation dwelling in a\r\ngloomy-looking district, only fit for cattle, and on that account\r\ndestitute of cities. They are at the foot of Mount Ascanimia and Mount\r\nComedus, along the bottom of which, and by a town called the Stone\r\nTower, is the long road much frequented by merchants which leads to\r\nChina.\r\n\r\n61. Around the glens at the bottom of the Imanian and Tapurian\r\nmountains, and within the Persian frontier, is a tribe of Scythians,\r\nbordering on the Asiatic Sarmatians, and touching the furthest side of\r\nthe Allemanni, who, like dwellers in a secluded spot, and made for\r\nsolitude, are scattered over the regions at long distances from one\r\nanother, and live on hard and poor food.\r\n\r\n62. And various tribes inhabit these districts, which, as I am\r\nhastening to other topics, I think superfluous to enumerate. But this is\r\nworth knowing, that among these tribes, which are almost unapproachable\r\non account of their excessive ferocity, there are some races of gentle\r\nand devout men, as the Jaxartæ and the Galactophagi, whom Homer mentions\r\nin his verses:--\r\n\r\n  +Glaktophagôn, Abiônte, dikaiotatôn anthrôpôn.+[147]\r\n\r\n63. Among the many rivers which flow through this land, either uniting\r\nat last with larger streams, or proceeding straight to the sea, the most\r\ncelebrated are the Roemnus, the Jaxartes, and the Talicus. There are\r\nbut three cities there of any note, Aspabota, Chauriana, and Saga.\r\n\r\n64. Beyond the districts of the two Scythias, on the eastern side, is a\r\nring of mountains which surround Serica, a country considerable both for\r\nits extent and the fertility of its soil. This tribe on their western\r\nside border on the Scythians, on the north and the east they look\r\ntowards snowy deserts; towards the south they extend as far as India and\r\nthe Ganges. The best known of its mountains are Annib, Nazavicium,\r\nAsmira, Emodon, and Opurocarra.\r\n\r\n65. The plain, which descends very suddenly from the hills, and is of\r\nconsiderable extent, is watered by two famous rivers, the OEchardes\r\nand the Bautis, which is less rapid than the other. The character too of\r\nthe different districts is very varied. One is extensive and level, the\r\nother is on a gentle slope, and therefore very fertile in corn, and\r\ncattle, and trees.\r\n\r\n66. The most fertile part of the country is inhabited by various tribes,\r\nof which the Alitrophagi, the Annibi, the Sisyges, and the Chardi lie to\r\nthe north, exposed to the frost; towards the east are the Rabannæ, the\r\nAsmiræ, and the Essedones, the most powerful of all, who are joined on\r\nthe west by the Athagoræ, and the Aspacaræ; and on the south by the\r\nBetæ, who live on the highest slopes of the mountains. Though they have\r\nnot many cities they have some of great size and wealth; the most\r\nbeautiful and renowned of which are Asmira, Essedon, Asparata, and Sera.\r\n\r\n67. The Seres themselves live quietly, always avoiding arms and\r\nbattles; and as ease is pleasant to moderate and quiet men, they give\r\ntrouble to none of their neighbours. Their climate is agreeable and\r\nhealthy; the sky serene, the breezes gentle and delicious. They have\r\nnumbers of shining groves, the trees of which through continued watering\r\nproduce a crop like the fleece of a sheep, which the natives make into a\r\ndelicate wool, and spin into a kind of fine cloth, formerly confined to\r\nthe use of the nobles, but now procurable by the lowest of the people\r\nwithout distinction.\r\n\r\n68. The natives themselves are the most frugal of men, cultivating a\r\npeaceful life, and shunning the society of other men. And when strangers\r\ncross their river to buy their cloth, or any other of their merchandise,\r\nthey interchange no conversation, but settle the price of the articles\r\nwanted by nods and signs; and they are so moderate that, while selling\r\ntheir own produce, they never buy any foreign wares.\r\n\r\n69. Beyond the Seres, towards the north, live the Ariani; their land is\r\nintersected by a navigable river called the Arias, which forms a huge\r\nlake known by the same name. This district of Asia is full of towns, the\r\nmost illustrious of which are Bitaxa, Sarmatina, Sotera, Nisibis, and\r\nAlexandria, from which last down the river to the Caspian Sea is a\r\ndistance of fifteen hundred furlongs.\r\n\r\n70. Close to their border, living on the slopes of the mountains, are\r\nthe Paropanisatæ, looking on the east towards India, and on the west\r\ntowards Mount Caucasus. Their principal river is Ortogordomaris, which\r\nrises in Bactria. They have some cities, the principal being Agazaca,\r\nNaulibus, and Ortopana, from which if you coast along the shore to the\r\nborders of Media which are nearest to the Caspian gates, the distance is\r\ntwo thousand two hundred furlongs.\r\n\r\n71. Next to them, among the hills, are the Drangiani, whose chief river\r\nis the Arabis, so called because it rises in Arabia; and their two\r\nprincipal towns are Prophthasia and Aniaspe, both wealthy and well\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n72. Next to them is Arachosia, which on the right extends as far as\r\nIndia. It is abundantly watered by a river much smaller than the Indus,\r\nthat greatest of rivers, which gives its name to the surrounding\r\nregions; in fact their river flows out of the Indus, and passes on till\r\nit forms the marsh known as Arachotoscrene. Its leading cities are\r\nAlexandria, Arbaca, and Choaspa.\r\n\r\n73. In the most inland districts of Persia is Gedrosia; which on its\r\nright touches the frontier of India, and is fertilized by several\r\nrivers, of which the greatest is the Artabius. There the Barbitani\r\nmountains end, and from their lowest parts rise several rivers which\r\nfall into the Indus, losing their own names in the greatness of that\r\nsuperior stream. They have several islands, and their principal cities\r\nare Sedratyra and Gynæcon.\r\n\r\n74. We need not detail minutely every portion of the sea-coast on the\r\nextremity of Persia, as it would lead us into too long a digression. It\r\nwill suffice to say that the sea which stretches from the Caspian\r\nmountains along the northern side to the straits above mentioned, is\r\nnine thousand furlongs in extent; the southern frontier, from the mouth\r\nof the Nile to the beginning of Carmania, is fourteen thousand furlongs.\r\n\r\n75. In these varied districts of different languages, the races of men\r\nare as different as the places. But to describe their persons and\r\ncustoms in general terms, they are nearly all slight in figure, swarthy\r\nor rather of a pale livid complexion; fierce-looking, with goat-like\r\neyes, and eyebrows arched in a semicircle and joined, with handsome\r\nbeards, and long hair. They at all times, even at banquets and\r\nfestivals, wear swords; a custom which that excellent author Thucydides\r\ntells us the Athenians were the first of the Greeks to lay aside.\r\n\r\n76. They are generally amazingly addicted to amatory pleasures; each man\r\nscarcely contenting himself with a multitude of concubines: from\r\nunnatural vices they are free. Each man marries many or few wives, as he\r\ncan afford them, so that natural affection is lost among them because of\r\nthe numerous objects of their licence. They are frugal in their\r\nbanquets, avoiding immoderate indulgence and especially hard drinking,\r\nas they would the plague.\r\n\r\n77. Nor, except at the king's table, have they any settled time for\r\ndining, but each man's stomach serves as his sun-dial; nor does any one\r\neat after he is satisfied.\r\n\r\n78. They are marvellously temperate and cautious, so that when sometimes\r\nmarching among the gardens and vineyards of enemies, they neither\r\ndesire nor touch anything, from fear of poison or witchcraft.\r\n\r\n79. They perform all the secret functions of nature with the most\r\nscrupulous secrecy and modesty.\r\n\r\n80. But they are so loose in their gait, and move with such correct ease\r\nand freedom, that you would think them effeminate, though they are most\r\nvigorous warriors; still they are rather crafty than bold, and are most\r\nformidable at a distance. They abound in empty words, and speak wildly\r\nand fiercely; they talk big, are proud, unmanageable, and threatening\r\nalike in prosperity and adversity; they are cunning, arrogant, and\r\ncruel, exercising the power of life and death over their slaves, and all\r\nlow-born plebeians. They flay men alive, both piecemeal, and by\r\nstripping off the whole skin. No servant while waiting on them, or\r\nstanding at their table, may gape, speak, or spit, so that their mouths\r\nare completely shut.\r\n\r\n81. Their laws are remarkably severe: the most stringent are against\r\ningratitude and against deserters; some too are abominable, inasmuch as\r\nfor the crime of one man they condemn all his relations.\r\n\r\n82. But as those only are appointed judges who are men of proved\r\nexperience and uprightness, and of such wisdom as to stand in no need of\r\nadvice, they laugh at our custom of sometimes appointing men of\r\neloquence and skill in public jurisprudence as guides to ignorant\r\njudges. The story that one judge was compelled to sit on the skin of\r\nanother, who had been condemned for his injustice, is either an ancient\r\nfable, or else, if ever there was such a custom, it has become obsolete.\r\n\r\n83. In military system and discipline, by continual exercises in the\r\nbusiness of the camp, and the adoption of the various manoeuvres which\r\nthey have learnt from us, they have become formidable even to the\r\ngreatest armies; they trust chiefly to the valour of their cavalry, in\r\nwhich all their nobles and rich men serve. Their infantry are armed like\r\nmirmillos,[148] and are as obedient as grooms; and they always follow\r\nthe cavalry like a band condemned to everlasting slavery, never\r\nreceiving either pay or gratuity. This nation, besides those whom it has\r\npermanently subdued, has also compelled many others to go under the\r\nyoke; so brave is it and so skilful in all warlike exercises, that it\r\nwould be invincible were it not continually weakened by civil and by\r\nforeign wars.\r\n\r\n84. Most of them wear garments brilliant with various colours, so\r\ncompletely enveloping the body that even though they leave the bosoms\r\nand sides of their robes open so as to flutter in the wind, still from\r\ntheir shoes to their head no part of their person is exposed. After\r\nconquering Croesus and subduing Lydia, they learnt also to wear golden\r\narmlets and necklaces, and jewels, especially pearls, of which they had\r\ngreat quantities.\r\n\r\n85. It only remains for me to say a few words about the origin of this\r\nstone. Among the Indians and Persians pearls are found in strong white\r\nsea-shells, being created at a regular time by the admixture of dew. For\r\nthe shells, desiring as it were a kind of copulation, open so as to\r\nreceive moisture from the nocturnal aspersion. Then becoming big they\r\nproduce little pearls in triplets, or pairs, or unions, which are so\r\ncalled because the shells when scaled often produce only single pearls,\r\nwhich then are larger.\r\n\r\n86. And a proof that this produce arises from and is nourished by some\r\naërial derivation rather than by any fattening power in the sea, is that\r\nthe drops of morning dew when infused into them make the stones bright\r\nand round; while the evening dew makes them crooked and red, and\r\nsometimes spotted. They become either small or large in proportion to\r\nthe quality of the moisture which they imbibe, and other circumstances.\r\nWhen they are shaken, as is often the case by thunder, the shells either\r\nbecome empty, or produce only weak pearls, or such as never come to\r\nmaturity.\r\n\r\n87. Fishing for them is difficult and dangerous, and this circumstance\r\nincreases their value; because, on account of the snares of the\r\nfishermen they are said to avoid the shores most frequented by them, and\r\nhide around rocks which are difficult of access and the hiding places of\r\nsharks.\r\n\r\n88. We are not ignorant that the same species of jewel is also produced\r\nand collected in the remote parts of the British sea; though of an\r\ninferior value.\r\n\r\n\r\n[138] The book containing this account is lost.\r\n\r\n[139] From +nikaô+, to conquer.\r\n\r\n[140] As the Greek epigram has it--\r\n\r\n  +Ton gaiês kai pontou ameiphtheisaisi keleuthois\r\n    Nautên êpeirou, pezoporon pelagous.+\r\n\r\n_Thus translated in Bohn's 'Greek Anthology,' p. 25_:--\r\n\r\n  Him, who reversed the laws great Nature gave,\r\n  Sail'd o'er the continent and walk'd the wave,\r\n  Three hundred spears from Sparta's iron plain\r\n  Have stopp'd. Oh blush, ye mountains and thou main!\r\n\r\n[141] The probability is that all these names are corrupt. Ammianus's\r\nignorance of the relative bearings of countries makes it difficult to\r\ndecide what they ought to be. If the proper reading of the last name be,\r\nas Valesius thinks, Sarbaletes, that is the name given by Ptolemy to a\r\npart of the Red Sea. A French translator of the last century considers\r\nthe Gulf of Armenia a portion of the Caspian Sea.\r\n\r\n[142] The Ebro.\r\n\r\n[143] The Guadalquivir.\r\n\r\n[144] Ammianus seems to distinguish between the Hyrcanian and Caspian\r\nSea, which are only different names for the same sea or inland lake.\r\n\r\n[145] A name not very unlike Nejid, to this day the most celebrated Arab\r\nbreed.\r\n\r\n[146] There is evidently some corruption here; there is no such Greek\r\nword as Machagistia.\r\n\r\n[147] Il. xiii. 10.\r\n\r\n[148] A kind of gladiator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK XXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nARGUMENT.\r\n\r\n     I. Julian invades Assyria with his army; receives the surrender of\r\n     Anatha, a fort on the Euphrates, and burns it.--II. Having made\r\n     attempts on other fortresses and towns, he burns some which were\r\n     deserted, and receives the surrender of Pirisabora, and burns\r\n     it.--III. On account of his successes, he promises his soldiers one\r\n     hundred denarii a man; and as they disdain so small a donation, he\r\n     in a modest oration recalls them to a proper feeling.--IV. The town\r\n     of Maogamalcha is stormed by the Romans, and rased to the\r\n     ground.--V. The Romans storm a fort of great strength, both in its\r\n     situation and fortifications, and burn it.--VI. Julian defeats the\r\n     Persians, slays two thousand five hundred of them, with the loss of\r\n     hardly seventy of his own men; and in a public assembly presents\r\n     many of his soldiers with crowns.--VII. Being deterred from laying\r\n     siege to Ctesiphon, he rashly orders all his boats to be burnt, and\r\n     retreats from the river.--VIII. As he was neither able to make\r\n     bridges, nor to be joined by a portion of his forces, he determines\r\n     to return by Corduena.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nA.D. 363.\r\n\r\n§ 1. After having ascertained the alacrity of his army, which with\r\nardour and unanimity declared with their customary shout that their\r\nfortunate emperor was invincible, Julian thinking it well to put an\r\nearly end to his enterprise, after a quiet night ordered the trumpets to\r\nsound a march; and everything being prepared which the arduous\r\ndifficulties of the war required, he at daybreak entered the Assyrian\r\nterritory in high spirits, riding in front of his ranks, and exciting\r\nall to discharge the duties of brave men in emulation of his own\r\ncourage.\r\n\r\n2. And as a leader of experience and skill, fearing lest his ignorance\r\nof the country might lead to his being surprised by secret ambuscades,\r\nhe began his march in line of battle. He ordered fifteen hundred\r\nskirmishers to precede him a short distance, who were to march slowly\r\nlooking out on each side and also in front, to prevent any sudden\r\nattack. The infantry in the centre were under his own command, they\r\nbeing the flower and chief strength of the whole army, while on the\r\nright were some legions under Nevitta, who was ordered to march along\r\nthe banks of the Euphrates. The left wing with the cavalry he gave to\r\nArinthæus and Hormisdas, with orders to lead them in close order through\r\nthe level and easy country of the plain. The rear was brought up by\r\nDagalaiphus and Victor, and the last of all was Secundinus, Duke of\r\nOsdruena.\r\n\r\n3. Then in order to alarm the enemy by the idea of his superior numbers,\r\nshould they attack him anywhere, or perceive him from a distance, he\r\nopened his ranks so as to spread both horses and men over a larger\r\nspace, in such a way that the rear was distant from the van nearly ten\r\nmiles; a manoeuvre of great skill which Pyrrhus of Epirus is said to\r\nhave often put in practice, extending his camp, or his lines, and\r\nsometimes on the other hand compressing them all, so as to present an\r\nappearance of greater or lesser numbers than the reality, according to\r\nthe circumstances of the moment.\r\n\r\n4. The baggage, the sutlers, all the camp-followers, and every kind of\r\nequipment, he placed between the two flanks of troops as they marched,\r\nso as not to leave them unprotected and liable to be carried off by any\r\nsudden attack, as has often happened. The fleet, although the river was\r\nexceedingly winding, was not allowed either to fall behind or to advance\r\nbefore the army.\r\n\r\n5. After two days' march we came near a deserted town called Dura, on\r\nthe bank of the river, where many herds of deer were found, some of\r\nwhich were slain by arrows, and others knocked down with the heavy oars,\r\nso that soldiers and sailors all had plenty of food; though the greater\r\npart of the animals, being used to swimming, plunged into the rapid\r\nstream and could not be stopped till they had reached their well known\r\nhaunts.\r\n\r\n6. Then after an easy march of four days, as evening came on, he\r\nembarked a thousand light-armed troops on board his boats, and sent the\r\nCount Lucillianus to storm the fortress of Anatha, which, like many\r\nother forts in that country, is surrounded by the waters of the\r\nEuphrates; Lucillianus having, as he was ordered, placed his ships in\r\nsuitable places, besieged the island, a cloudy night favouring a secret\r\nassault.\r\n\r\n7. But as soon as it became light, one of the garrison going out to get\r\nwater, saw the enemy, and immediately raised an outcry, which roused the\r\nawakened garrison to arm in their defence. And presently, from a high\r\nwatch-tower, the emperor examined the situation of the fort, and came up\r\nwith all speed escorted by two vessels, and followed by a considerable\r\nsquadron laden with engines for the siege.\r\n\r\n8. And as he approached the walls, and considered that the contest could\r\nnot be carried on without great risk, he tried both by conciliatory and\r\nthreatening language to induce the garrison to surrender; and they,\r\nhaving invited Hormisdas to a conference, were won over by his promises\r\nand oaths to rely on the mercy of the Romans.\r\n\r\n9. At last, driving before them a crowned ox, which among them is a sign\r\nof peace, they descended from the fort as suppliants; the fort was\r\nburnt, and Pusæus, its commander, who was afterwards Duke of Egypt, was\r\nappointed to the rank of tribune. The rest of the garrison with their\r\nfamilies and property were conducted with all kindness to the Syrian\r\ncity of Chalcis.\r\n\r\n10. Among them was found a certain soldier, who formerly, when Maximian\r\ninvaded Persia, had been left in this district as an invalid, though a\r\nvery young man, but who was now bent with age, and according to his own\r\naccount had several wives, as is the custom of that country, and a\r\nnumerous offspring. He now full of joy, professing to have been a\r\nprincipal cause of the surrender, was led to our camp, calling many of\r\nhis comrades to witness that he had long foreseen and often foretold\r\nthat, though nearly a hundred years' old, he should be buried in Roman\r\nground. After this event, the Saracens brought in some skirmishers of\r\nthe enemy whom they had taken; these were received with joy by the\r\nemperor, the Saracens rewarded, and sent back to achieve similar\r\nexploits.\r\n\r\n11. The next day another disaster took place; a whirlwind arose, and\r\nmade havoc in many places, throwing down many buildings, tearing in\r\npieces the tents, and throwing the soldiers on their backs or on their\r\nfaces, the violence of the wind overpowering their steadiness of foot.\r\nAnd the same day another equally perilous occurrence took place. For the\r\nriver suddenly overflowed its banks, and some of the ships laden with\r\nprovisions were wrecked, the piers and dams which had been constructed\r\nof stone to check and repress the waters being swept away; and whether\r\nthat was done by treachery or through the weight of the waters could not\r\nbe known.\r\n\r\n12. After having stormed and burnt the chief city, and sent away the\r\nprisoners, the army with increased confidence raised triumphant shouts\r\nin honour of the emperor, thinking that the gods were evidently making\r\nhim the object of their peculiar care.\r\n\r\n13. And because in these unknown districts they were forced to be on\r\nunusual guard against hidden dangers, the troops especially feared the\r\ncraft and exceeding deceitfulness of the enemy; and therefore the\r\nemperor was everywhere, sometimes in front, sometimes with his\r\nlight-armed battalions protecting the rear, in order to see that no\r\nconcealed danger threatened it, reconnoitring the dense jungles and\r\nvalleys, and restraining the distant sallies of his soldiers, sometimes\r\nwith his natural gentleness, and sometimes with threats.\r\n\r\n14. But he allowed the fields of the enemy which were loaded with every\r\nkind of produce to be burnt with their crops and cottages, after his men\r\nhad collected all that they could themselves make use of. And in this\r\nway the enemy were terribly injured before they were aware of it; for\r\nthe soldiers freely used what they had acquired with their own hands,\r\nthinking that they had found a fresh field for their valour; and joyful\r\nat the abundance of their supplies, they saved what they had in their\r\nown boats.\r\n\r\n15. But one rash soldier, being intoxicated, and having crossed over to\r\nthe opposite bank of the river, was taken prisoner before our eyes by\r\nthe enemy, and was put to death.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. After this we arrived at a fort called Thilutha, situated in the\r\nmiddle of the river on a very high piece of ground, and fortified by\r\nnature as if by the art of man. The inhabitants were invited gently, as\r\nwas best, to surrender, since the height of their fort made it\r\nimpregnable; but they refused all terms as yet, though they answered\r\nthat when the Romans had advanced further so as to occupy the interior\r\nof the country, they also as an appendage would come over to the\r\nconqueror.\r\n\r\n2. Having made this reply they quietly looked down upon our boats as\r\nthey passed under the very walls without attempting to molest them. When\r\nthat fort was passed we came to another called Achaiacala, also defended\r\nby the river flowing round it, and difficult to scale, where we received\r\na similar answer, and so passed on. The next day we came to another fort\r\nwhich had been deserted because its walls were weak; and we burnt it and\r\nproceeded.\r\n\r\n3. In the two next days we marched two hundred furlongs, and arrived at\r\na place called Paraxmalcha. We then crossed the river, and seven miles\r\nfurther on we entered the city of Diacira, which we found empty of\r\ninhabitants but full of corn and excellent salt, and here we saw a\r\ntemple placed on the summit of a lofty height. We burnt the city and put\r\na few women to death whom we found there, and having passed a bituminous\r\nspring; we entered the town of Ozogardana, which its inhabitants had\r\ndeserted for fear of our approaching army; in that town is shown a\r\ntribunal of the emperor Trajan.\r\n\r\n4. This town also we burnt after we had rested there two days to refresh\r\nour bodies. On the second day just at nightfall, the Surena (who is the\r\nofficer next in rank to the king among the Persians), and a man named\r\nMalechus Podosaces, the chief of the Assanite Saracens, who had long\r\nravaged our frontiers with great ferocity, laid a snare for Hormisdas,\r\nwhom by some means or other they had learnt was about to go forth on a\r\nreconnoitring expedition, and only failed because the river being very\r\nnarrow at that point, was so deep as to be unfordable.\r\n\r\n5. And so at daybreak, when the enemy were now in sight, the moment that\r\nthey were discovered by their glittering helmets and bristling armour,\r\nour men sprang up vigorously to the conflict, and dashed at them with\r\ngreat courage; and although the enemy wielded their huge bows with great\r\nstrength, and the glistening of their weapons increased the alarm of our\r\nsoldiers, yet their rage, and the compactness of their ranks, kept alive\r\nand added fuel to their courage.\r\n\r\n6. Animated by their first success, our army advanced to the village of\r\nMacepracta, where were seen vestiges of walls half destroyed, which had\r\nonce been of great extent, and had served to protect Assyria from\r\nforeign invasion.\r\n\r\n7. At this point a portion of the river is drawn off in large canals\r\nwhich convey it to the interior districts of Babylonia, for the service\r\nof the surrounding country and cities. Another branch of the river known\r\nas the Nahamalca, which means \"the river of kings,\" passes by Ctesiphon;\r\nat the beginning of this stream there is a lofty tower like a\r\nlighthouse, by which our infantry passed on a carefully constructed\r\nbridge.\r\n\r\n8. The cavalry and cattle then took the stream where it was less\r\nviolent, and swam across obliquely; another body was suddenly attacked\r\nby the enemy with a storm of arrows and javelins, but our light-armed\r\nauxiliaries as soon as they reached the other side, supported them, and\r\nput the enemy to flight, cutting them to pieces as they fled.\r\n\r\n9. After having successfully accomplished this exploit, we arrived at\r\nthe city of Pirisabora, of great size and populousness, and also\r\nsurrounded with water. But the emperor having ridden all round the walls\r\nand reconnoitred its position, began to lay siege to it with great\r\ncaution, as if he would make the townsmen abandon its defence from mere\r\nterror. But after several negotiations and conferences with them, as\r\nthey would yield neither to promises nor to threats, he set about the\r\nsiege in earnest, and surrounded the walls with three lines of soldiers.\r\nThe whole of the first day the combat was carried on with missiles till\r\nnightfall.\r\n\r\n10. But the garrison, full of courage and vigour, spreading cloths loose\r\neverywhere over the battlements to weaken the attacks of our weapons,\r\nand protected by shields strongly woven of osier, made a brave\r\nresistance, looking like figures of iron, since they had plates of iron\r\nclosely fitting over every limb, which covered their whole person with a\r\nsafe defence.\r\n\r\n11. Sometimes also they earnestly invited Hormisdas as a countryman and\r\na prince of royal blood to a conference; but when he came they reviled\r\nhim with abuse and reproaches as a traitor and deserter; and after a\r\ngreat part of the day had been consumed in this slow disputing, at the\r\nbeginning of night many kinds of engines were brought against the walls,\r\nand we began to fill up the ditches.\r\n\r\n12. But before it was quite dawn, the garrison perceived what was being\r\ndone, with the addition that a violent stroke of a battering-ram had\r\nbroken down a tower at one corner; so they abandoned the double city\r\nwall, and occupied a citadel close to the wall, erected on the level\r\nsummit of a ragged hill, of which the centre, rising up to a great\r\nheight in its round circle, resembled an Argive shield, except that in\r\nthe north it was not quite round, but at that point it was protected by\r\na precipice which ran sheer down into the Euphrates; the walls were\r\nbuilt of baked bricks and bitumen, a combination which is well known to\r\nbe the strongest of all materials.\r\n\r\n13. And now the savage soldiery, having traversed the city, which they\r\nfound empty, were fighting fiercely with the defenders who poured all\r\nkinds of missiles on them from the citadel. Being hard pressed by the\r\ncatapults and balistæ of our men, they also raised on the height huge\r\nbows of great power, the extremities of which, rising high on each side,\r\ncould only be bent slowly; but the string, when loosed by violent\r\nexertion of the fingers, sent forth iron-tipped arrows with such force\r\nas to inflict fatal wounds on any one whom they struck.\r\n\r\n14. Nevertheless, the fight was maintained on both sides with showers of\r\nstones thrown by the hand, and as neither gained any ground a fierce\r\ncontest was protracted from daybreak to nightfall with great obstinacy;\r\nand at last they parted without any advantage to either side. The next\r\nday the fight was renewed with great violence, and numbers were slain on\r\neach side, and still the result was even; when the emperor, being eager\r\namid this reciprocal slaughter to try every chance, being guarded by a\r\nsolid column, and defended from the arrows of the enemy by their closely\r\npacked shields, rushed forward with a rapid charge up to the enemy's\r\ngates, which were faced with stout iron.\r\n\r\n15. And although he was still in some danger, being hard pressed with\r\nstones and bullets and other weapons, still he cheered on his men with\r\nfrequent war-cries while they were preparing to force in the gates in\r\norder to effect an entrance, and did not retreat till he found himself\r\non the point of being entirely overwhelmed by the mass of missiles\r\nwhich were poured down on him.\r\n\r\n16. However, he came off safe with only a few of his men slightly\r\nwounded; not without feeling some modest shame at being repulsed. For he\r\nhad read that Scipio Æmilianus, with the historian Polybius, a citizen\r\nof Megalopolis in Arcadia, and thirty thousand soldiers, had, by a\r\nsimilar attack, forced the gate of Carthage.\r\n\r\n17. But the account given by the old writers may serve to defend this\r\nmodern attempt; for Æmilianus approached a gate protected by a\r\nstone-covered testudo, under which he safely forced his way into the\r\ncity while the garrison was occupied in demolishing this stone roof. But\r\nJulian attacked a place completely exposed, while the whole face of\r\nheaven was darkened by the fragments of rock and weapons which were\r\nshowered upon him, and was even then with great difficulty repulsed and\r\nforced to retire.\r\n\r\n18. After this hasty and tumultuous assault, as the vast preparations of\r\nsheds and mounds which were carried on were attended with much\r\ndifficulty, through the hindrances offered by the garrison, Julian\r\nordered an engine called helepolis to be constructed with all speed;\r\nwhich, as we have already mentioned, King Demetrius used, and earned the\r\ntitle of Poliorcetes by the number of cities which he took.\r\n\r\n19. The garrison, anxiously viewing this engine, which was to exceed the\r\nheight of their lofty towers, and considering at the same time the\r\ndetermination of the besiegers, suddenly betook themselves to\r\nsupplications, and spreading over the towers and walls, imploring the\r\npardon and protection of the Romans with outstretched hands.\r\n\r\n20. And when they saw that the works of the Romans were suspended, and\r\nthat those who were constructing them were doing nothing, which seemed a\r\nsure token of peace, they requested an opportunity of conferring with\r\nHormisdas.\r\n\r\n21. And when this was granted, Mamersides, the commander of the\r\ngarrison, was let down by a rope, and conducted to the emperor as he\r\ndesired; and having received a promise of his own life, and of impunity\r\nto all his comrades he was allowed to return to the city. And when he\r\nrelated what had been done, the citizens unanimously agreed to follow\r\nhis advice and accept the terms; and peace was solemnly made with all\r\nthe sanctions of religion, the gates were thrown open, and the whole\r\npopulation went forth proclaiming that a protecting genius had shone\r\nupon them in the person of the great and merciful Cæsar.\r\n\r\n22. The number of those who surrendered was two thousand five hundred,\r\nfor the rest of the citizens, expecting the siege beforehand, had\r\ncrossed the river in small boats and abandoned the city. In the citadel\r\na great store of arms and provisions was found; and after they had taken\r\nwhat they required, the conquerors burnt the rest as well as the place\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. The day after these transactions, serious news reached the emperor\r\nas he was quietly taking his dinner, that the Surena, the Persian\r\ngeneral, had surprised three squadrons of our advanced guard, and slain\r\na few, among whom was one tribune; and had also taken a standard.\r\n\r\n2. Immediately Julian became violently exasperated, and flew to the spot\r\nwith an armed band, placing much hope of success in the rapidity of his\r\nmovements: he routed the assailants disgracefully, cashiered the other\r\ntwo tribunes as blunderers and cowards, and in imitation of the ancient\r\nlaws of Rome disbanded ten of the soldiers who had fled, and then\r\ncondemned them to death.\r\n\r\n3. Then, having burnt the city as I have already mentioned, he mounted a\r\ntribunal which he had caused to be erected, and having convoked his\r\narmy, he thanked them, and counted upon their achieving other similar\r\nexploits. He also promised them each a hundred pieces of silver; but\r\nseeing that they were inclined to murmur, as being disappointed at the\r\nsmallness of the sum, he became most indignant and said:--\r\n\r\n4. \"Behold the Persians who abound in wealth of every kind; their riches\r\nmay enrich you if we only behave gallantly with one unanimous spirit of\r\nresolution. But after having been very rich, I assure you that the\r\nrepublic is at this moment in great want, through the conduct of those\r\nmen who, to increase their own wealth, taught former emperors to return\r\nhome after buying peace of the barbarians with gold.\r\n\r\n5. \"The treasury is empty, the cities are exhausted, the finances are\r\nstripped bare. I myself have neither treasures, nor, noble as I am by\r\nbirth, do I inherit anything from my family but a heart free from all\r\nfear. Nor shall I be ashamed to place all my happiness in the\r\ncultivation of my mind, while preferring an honourable poverty. For the\r\nFabricii also conducted great wars while poor in estate and rich only in\r\nglory.\r\n\r\n6. \"Of all these things you may have plenty, if, discarding all fear,\r\nyou act with moderation, obeying the cautious guidance of God and\r\nmyself, as far as human reason can lead you safely; but if you disobey,\r\nand choose to return to your former shameful mutinies, proceed.\r\n\r\n7. \"As an emperor should do, I by myself, having performed the important\r\nduties which belong to me, will die standing, despising a life which any\r\nfever may take from me: or else I will abdicate my power, for I have not\r\nlived so as to be unable to descend to a private station. I rejoice in,\r\nand feel proud of the fact that there are with me many leaders of proved\r\nskill and courage, perfect in every kind of military knowledge.\"\r\n\r\n8. By this modest speech of their emperor, thus unmoved alike by\r\nprosperity and adversity, the soldiers were for a time appeased,\r\nregaining confidence with an expectation of better success; and\r\nunanimously promised to be docile and obedient, at the same time\r\nextolling Julian's authority and magnanimity to the skies; and, as is\r\ntheir wont when their feelings are genuine and cordial, they showed them\r\nby a gentle rattling of their arms.\r\n\r\n9. Then they returned to their tents, and refreshed themselves with\r\nfood, for which they had abundant means, and with sleep during the\r\nnight. But Julian encouraged his army not by the idea of their families,\r\nbut by the thoughts of the greatness of the enterprises in which they\r\nwere embarked: continually making vows--\"So might he be able to make the\r\nPersians pass under the yoke.\" \"So might he restore the Roman power\r\nwhich had been shaken in those regions,\"--in imitation of Trajan, who\r\nwas accustomed frequently to confirm anything he had said by the\r\nimprecations--\"So may I see Dacia reduced to the condition of a\r\nprovince; so may I bridge over the Danube and Euphrates,\"--using many\r\nsimilar forms of attestation.\r\n\r\n10. Then after proceeding fourteen miles further we came to a certain\r\nspot where the soil is fertilized by the abundance of water. But as the\r\nPersians had learnt that we should advance by this road, they removed\r\nthe dams and allowed the waters to flood the country.\r\n\r\n11. The ground being thereby, for a great distance, reduced to the state\r\nof a marsh, the emperor gave the soldiers the next day for rest, and\r\nadvancing in front himself, constructed a number of little bridges of\r\nbladders, and coracles[149] made of skins, and rafts of palm-tree\r\ntimber, and thus led his army across, though not without difficulty.\r\n\r\n12. In this region many of the fields are planted with vineyards and\r\nvarious kinds of fruit trees; and palm-trees grow there over a great\r\nextent of country, reaching as far as Mesene and the ocean, forming\r\ngreat groves. And wherever any one goes he sees continual stocks and\r\nsuckers of palms, from the fruit of which abundance of honey and wine is\r\nmade, and the palms themselves are said to be divided into male and\r\nfemale, and it is added that the two sexes can be easily distinguished.\r\n\r\n13. They say further that the female trees produce fruit when\r\nimpregnated by the seeds of the male trees, and even that they feel\r\ndelight in their mutual love: and that this is clearly shown by the fact\r\nthat they lean towards one another, and cannot be bent back even by\r\nstrong winds--and if by any unusual accident a female tree is not\r\nimpregnated by the male seed, it produces nothing but imperfect fruit,\r\nand if they cannot find out with what male tree any female tree is in\r\nlove, they smear the trunk of some tree with the oil which proceeds from\r\nher, and then some other tree naturally conceives a fondness for the\r\nodour; and these proofs create some belief in the story of their\r\ncopulation.\r\n\r\n14. The army then, having sated itself with these fruits, passed by\r\nseveral islands, and instead of the scarcity which they apprehended, the\r\nfear arose that they would become too fat. At last, after having been\r\nattacked by an ambuscade of the enemy's archers, but having avenged\r\nthemselves well, they came to a spot where the larger portion of the\r\nEuphrates is divided into a number of small streams.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n§ 1. In this district a city, which on account of the lowness of its\r\nwalls, had been deserted by its Jewish inhabitants, was burnt by our\r\nangry soldiers. And afterwards the emperor proceeded further on, being\r\nelated at the manifest protection, as he deemed it, of the Deity.\r\n\r\n2. And when he had reached Maogamalcha, a city of great size and\r\nsurrounded with strong walls, he pitched his tent, and took anxious care\r\nthat his camp should not be surprised by any sudden attack of the\r\nPersian cavalry; whose courage in the open plains is marvellously\r\ndreaded by the surrounding nations.\r\n\r\n3. And when he had made his arrangements, he himself, with an escort of\r\na few light troops, went forth on foot to reconnoitre the position of a\r\ncity by a close personal examination; but he fell into a dangerous snare\r\nfrom which he with difficulty escaped with his life.\r\n\r\n4. For ten armed Persians stole out by a gate of the town of which he\r\nwas not aware, and crawled on their hands and knees along the bottom of\r\nthe hill, till they got within reach so as to fall silently upon our\r\nmen, and two of them distinguishing the emperor by his superior\r\nappearance, made at him with drawn swords; but he encountered them with\r\nhis shield raised, and protecting himself with that, and fighting with\r\ngreat and noble courage, he ran one of them through the body, while his\r\nguards killed the other with repeated blows. The rest, of whom some were\r\nwounded, were put to flight, and the two who were slain were stripped of\r\ntheir arms, and the emperor led back his comrades in safety, laden with\r\ntheir spoils, into the camp, where he was received with universal joy.\r\n\r\n5. Torquatus took a golden necklace from one of the enemy whom he had\r\nslain. Valerius by the aid of a crow defeated a haughty Gaul and earned\r\nthe surname of Corvinus, and by this glory these heroes were recommended\r\nto posterity. We do not envy them, but let this gallant exploit be added\r\nto those ancient memorials.\r\n\r\n6. The next day a bridge was laid across the river, and the army passed\r\nover it, and pitched their camp in a fresh and more healthy place,\r\nfortifying it with a double rampart, since, as we have said, the open\r\nplains were regarded with apprehension. And then he undertook the siege\r\nof the town, thinking it too dangerous to march forward while leaving\r\nformidable enemies in his rear.\r\n\r\n7. While he was making great exertions to complete his preparations, the\r\nSurena, the enemy's general, fell upon the cattle which were feeding in\r\nthe palm groves, but was repulsed by those of our squadrons who were\r\nappointed to that service, and, having lost a few men, he retired.\r\n\r\n8. And the inhabitants of two cities which are made islands by the\r\nrivers which surround them, fearing to trust in their means of defence,\r\nfled for refuge to Ctesiphon, some fleeing through the thick woods,\r\nothers crossing the neighbouring marshes on canoes formed out of\r\nhollowed trees, and thus made a long journey to the principal or indeed\r\nthe only shelter which existed for them, intending to proceed to still\r\nmore distant regions.\r\n\r\n9. Some of them were overtaken, and on their resistance were put to\r\ndeath by our soldiers, who, traversing various districts in barks and\r\nsmall boats, brought in from time to time many prisoners. For it had\r\nbeen cleverly arranged that, while the infantry was besieging the town,\r\nthe squadrons of cavalry should scour the country in small bands in\r\norder to bring in booty. And by this system, without doing any injury to\r\nthe inhabitants of the provinces, the soldiers fed on the bowels of the\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\n10. And by this time the emperor was besieging with all his might and\r\nwith a triple line of heavily armed soldiers this town which was\r\nfortified with a double wall; and he had great hope of succeeding in his\r\nenterprise. But if the attempt was indispensable, the execution was very\r\ndifficult. For the approach to the town lay everywhere over rocks of\r\ngreat height and abruptness; across which there was no straight road;\r\nand dangers of two kinds seemed to render the place inaccessible. In the\r\nfirst place there were towers formidable both for their height and for\r\nthe number of their garrison; equalling in height the natural mountain\r\non which the citadel was built; and secondly, a sloping plain reached\r\ndown to the river, which again was protected by stout ramparts.\r\n\r\n11. There was a third difficulty not less formidable that the numerous\r\ngarrison of picked men which defended the place could not be won over by\r\nany caresses to surrender, but resisted the enemy as if resolved either\r\nto conquer or to perish amid the ashes of their country. The soldiers,\r\nwho desired to attack at once, and also insisted upon a pitched battle\r\nin a fair field, could hardly be restrained, and when the retreat was\r\nsounded they burnt with indignation, being eager to make courageous\r\nonsets on the enemy.\r\n\r\n12. But the wisdom of our leaders overcame the eagerness of mere\r\ncourage; and the work being distributed, every one set about his\r\nallotted task with great alacrity. For on one side high mounds were\r\nraised; on another other parties were raising the deep ditches to the\r\nlevel of the ground; in other quarters hollow pitfalls were covered over\r\nwith long planks; artisans also were placing mural engines soon intended\r\nto burst forth with fatal roars.\r\n\r\n13. Nevitta and Dagalaiphus superintended the miners and the erection of\r\nthe vineæ, or penthouses; but the beginning of the actual conflict, and\r\nthe defence of the machines from fire or from sallies of the garrison,\r\nthe emperor took to himself. And when all the preparations for taking\r\nthe city had been completed by this variety of labour, and the soldiers\r\ndemanded to be led to the assault, a captain named Victor returned, who\r\nhad explored all the roads as far as Ctesiphon, and now brought word\r\nthat he had met with no obstacles.\r\n\r\n14. At this news all the soldiers became wild with joy, and being more\r\nelated and eager for the contest than ever, they waited under arms for\r\nthe signal.\r\n\r\n15. And now on both sides the trumpets sounded with martial clang, and\r\nthe Roman vanguard, with incessant attacks and threatening cries,\r\nassailed the enemy, who were covered from head to foot with thin plates\r\nof iron like the feathers of a bird, and who had full confidence that\r\nany weapons that fell on this hard iron would recoil; while our\r\nclose-packed shields with which our men covered themselves as with a\r\ntestudo, opened loosely so as to adapt themselves to their continual\r\nmotion. On the other hand the Persians, obstinately clinging to their\r\nwalls, laboured with all their might to avoid and frustrate our deadly\r\nattacks.\r\n\r\n16. But when the assailants, pushing the osier fences before them,\r\npassed up to the walls, the archers, slingers and others, rolling down\r\nhuge stones, with firebrands and fire-pots, repelled them to a distance.\r\nThen the balistæ, armed with wooden arrows, were bent and loosened with\r\na horrid creak, and poured forth incessant storms of darts. And the\r\nscorpions hurled forth round stones under the guidance of the skilful\r\nhands of their workers.\r\n\r\n17. The combat was repeated and redoubled in violence till the heat\r\nincreasing up to midday, and the sun burning up everything with its\r\nevaporation, recalled from the battle the combatants on both sides,\r\nequally intent as they were on the works and on the fray, but thoroughly\r\nexhausted by fatigue and dripping with sweat.\r\n\r\n18. The same plan was followed the next day, the two parties contending\r\nresolutely in various modes of fighting, and again they parted with\r\nequal valour, and equal fortune. But in every danger the emperor was\r\nforemost among the armed combatants, urging on the destruction of the\r\ncity lest, by being detained too long before its walls, he should be\r\nforced to abandon other objects which he had at heart.\r\n\r\n19. But in times of emergency nothing is so unimportant as not\r\noccasionally to influence great affairs, even contrary to all\r\nexpectation. For when, as had often happened, the two sides were\r\nfighting slackly, and on the point of giving over, a battering-ram which\r\nhad just been brought up, being pushed forward awkwardly, struck down a\r\ntower which was higher than any of the others, and was very strongly\r\nbuilt of baked brick, and its fall brought down all the adjacent portion\r\nof the wall with a mighty crash.\r\n\r\n20. Then in the variety of incidents which arose, the exertions of the\r\nbesiegers and the gallantry of the besieged were equally conspicuous\r\nwith noble exploits. For to our soldiers, inflamed with anger and\r\nindignation, nothing appeared difficult. To the garrison, fighting for\r\ntheir safety, nothing seemed dangerous or formidable. At last, when the\r\nfierce contest had raged a long time and was still undecided, great\r\nslaughter having been made on both sides, the close of day broke it off,\r\nand both armies yielded to fatigue.\r\n\r\n21. While these matters were thus going on in broad daylight, news was\r\nbrought to the emperor, who was full of watchful care, that the\r\nlegionary soldiers to whom the digging of the mines had been intrusted,\r\nhaving hollowed out their subterranean paths and supported them with\r\nstout stakes, had now reached the bottom of the foundations of the\r\nwalls, and were ready to issue forth if he thought fit.\r\n\r\n22. When therefore a great part of the night was passed, the brazen\r\ntrumpets sounded the signal for advancing to battle, and the troops ran\r\nto arms; and as had been planned, the wall was attacked on both its\r\nfaces, in order that while the garrison were running to and fro to repel\r\nthe danger, and while the noise of the iron tools of the miners digging\r\nat the foundations was overpowered by the din of battle, the miners\r\nshould come forth on a sudden without any one being at the mouth of the\r\nmine to resist them.\r\n\r\n23. When these plans had all been arranged, and the garrison was fully\r\noccupied, the mine was opened, and Exsuperius, a soldier of the\r\nVictorian legion, sprung out, followed by a tribune named Magnus, and\r\nJovianus, a secretary, and an intrepid body of common soldiers, who,\r\nafter slaughtering all the men found in the temple into which the mine\r\nopened, went cautiously forward and slew the sentinels, who were\r\noccupying themselves after the fashion of their country in singing the\r\npraises, the justice, and good fortune of their king.\r\n\r\n24. It was believed that Mars himself (if indeed the gods are permitted\r\nto mingle with men) aided Luscinus when he forced the camp of the\r\nLucanians. And it was the more believed because in the height of the\r\nconflict there was seen an armed figure of enormous size carrying\r\nladders, who the next day, when the roll was called over, though sought\r\nfor very carefully, could not be found anywhere; when if he had really\r\nbeen a soldier he would have come forward of his own accord from a\r\nconsciousness of his gallant action. But though on that occasion it was\r\nnever known who performed that splendid achievement, yet those who now\r\nbehaved bravely were not unknown, but received obsidional crowns, and\r\nwere publicly praised according to the ancient fashion.\r\n\r\n25. At last the fated city, its numerous entrances being laid open, was\r\nentered by the Romans, and the furious troops destroyed all whom they\r\nfound, without regard to age or sex. Some of the citizens, from dread of\r\nimpending destruction, threatened on one side with fire, on the other\r\nwith the sword, weeping threw themselves headlong over the walls, and\r\nbeing crippled in all their limbs, led for a few hours or days a life\r\nmore miserable than any death till they were finally killed.\r\n\r\n26. But Nabdates, the captain of the garrison, was taken alive with\r\neighty of his guards; and when he was brought before the emperor, that\r\nmagnanimous and merciful prince ordered him to be kept in safety. The\r\nbooty was divided according to a fair estimate of the merits and labours\r\nof the troops. The emperor, who was contented with very little, took for\r\nhis own share of the victory he had thus gained three pieces of gold and\r\na dumb child who was brought to him, and who by elegant signs and\r\ngesticulations explained all he knew, and considered that an acceptable\r\nand sufficient prize.\r\n\r\n27. But of the virgins who were taken prisoners, and who, as was likely\r\nin Persia, where female beauty is remarkable, were exceedingly\r\nbeautiful, he would neither touch nor even see one; imitating Alexander\r\nand Scipio, who refused similar opportunities, in order, after having\r\nproved themselves unconquered by toil, not to show themselves the\r\nvictims of desire.\r\n\r\n28. While the battle was going on, an engineer on our side, whose name I\r\ndo not know, who happened to be standing just behind a scorpion, was\r\nknocked down and killed by the recoil of a stone, which the worker of\r\nthe engine had fitted to the sling carelessly, his whole body being so\r\ndislocated and battered that he could not even be recognized.\r\n\r\n29. After the town was taken intelligence was brought to the emperor\r\nthat a troop was lying in ambuscade in some concealed pits around the\r\nwalls of the town just taken (of which pits there are many in those\r\ndistricts), with the intention of surprising the rear of our army by a\r\nsudden attack.\r\n\r\n30. A body of picked infantry of tried courage was therefore sent to\r\ntake the troop prisoners. But as they could neither force their way\r\ninto the pits, nor induce those concealed in them to come forth to\r\nfight, they collected some straw and faggots, and piled them up before\r\nthe mouths of the caves, and then set them on fire, from which the smoke\r\npenetrated into the caverns through the narrow crevice, being the more\r\ndense because of the small space through which it was forced, and so\r\nsuffocated some of them; others the fire compelled to come forth to\r\ninstant destruction; and in this manner they were destroyed by sword or\r\nby fire, and our men returned with speed to their camp. Thus was this\r\nlarge and populous city, with its powerful garrison, stormed by the\r\nRomans, and the city itself reduced to ruins.\r\n\r\n31. After this glorious exploit the bridges which led over several\r\nrivers were crossed in succession, and we reached two forts, constructed\r\nwith great strength and skill, where the son of the king endeavoured to\r\nprevent Count Victor, who was marching in the van of the army, from\r\ncrossing the river, having advanced for that purpose from Ctesiphon with\r\na large body of nobles and a considerable armed force; but when he saw\r\nthe numbers which were following Victor, he retreated.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n§ 1. So we advanced and came to some groves, and also to some fields\r\nfertile with a great variety of crops, where we found a palace built in\r\nthe Roman fashion, which, so pleased were we with the circumstance, we\r\nleft unhurt.\r\n\r\n2. There was also in this same place a large round space, enclosed,\r\ncontaining wild beasts, intended for the king's amusement; lions with\r\nshaggy manes, tusked boars, and bears of amazing ferocity (as the\r\nPersian bears are), and other chosen beasts of vast size. Our cavalry,\r\nhowever, forced the gates of this enclosure, and killed all the beasts\r\nwith hunting-spears and clouds of arrows.\r\n\r\n3. This district is rich and well cultivated: not far off is Coche,\r\nwhich is also called Seleucia; where we fortified a camp with great\r\ncelerity, and rested there two days to refresh the army with timely\r\nsupplies of water and provisions. The emperor himself in the meanwhile\r\nproceeded with his advanced guard and reconnoitred a deserted city which\r\nhad been formerly destroyed by the Emperor Verus, where an everlasting\r\nspring forms a large tube which communicates with the Tigris. Here we\r\nsaw, hanging on gallows, many bodies of the relations of the man whom we\r\nhave spoken of above as having betrayed Pirisabora.\r\n\r\n4. Here also Nabdates was burnt alive, he whom I have mentioned above as\r\nhaving been taken with eighty of his garrison while hiding among the\r\nruins of the city which we had taken; because at the beginning of the\r\nsiege he had secretly promised to betray it, but afterwards had resisted\r\nus vigorously, and after having been unexpectedly pardoned had risen to\r\nsuch a pitch of violence as to launch all kinds of abuse against\r\nHormisdas.\r\n\r\n5. Then after advancing some distance we heard of a sad disaster: for\r\nwhile three cohorts of the advanced guard, who were in light marching\r\norder, were fighting with a Persian division which had made a sally out\r\nof the city gates, another body of the enemy cut off and slew our\r\ncattle, which were following us on the other side of the river, with a\r\nfew of our foragers who were straggling about in no great order.\r\n\r\n6. The emperor was enraged and indignant at this; he was now near the\r\ndistrict of Ctesiphon, and had just reached a lofty and well-fortified\r\ncastle. He went himself to reconnoitre it, being, as he fancied,\r\nconcealed, as he rode with a small escort close to the walls; but as\r\nfrom too much eagerness he got within bowshot, he was soon noticed, and\r\nwas immediately assailed by every kind of missile, and would have been\r\nkilled by an arrow shot from an engine on the walls, if it had not\r\nstruck his armour-bearer, who kept close by his side, and he himself,\r\nbeing protected by the closely-packed shields of his guards, fell back,\r\nafter having been exposed to great danger.\r\n\r\n7. At this he was greatly enraged, and determined to lay siege to the\r\nfort; but the garrison was very resolute to defend it, believing the\r\nplace to be nearly inaccessible, and that the king, who was advancing\r\nwith great speed at the head of a large army, would soon arrive to their\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\n8. And now, the vineæ and everything else required for the siege being\r\nprepared, at the second watch, when the night, which happened to be one\r\nof very bright moonlight, made everything visible to the defenders on\r\nthe battlements, suddenly the whole multitude of the garrison formed\r\ninto one body, threw open the gates and sallied out, and attacking a\r\ndivision of our men who were not expecting them, slew numbers, among\r\nwhom one tribune was killed as he was endeavouring to repel the attack.\r\n\r\n9. And while this was going on, the Persians, having attacked a portion\r\nof our men in the same manner as before from the opposite side of the\r\nriver, slew some and took others prisoners. And our men, in alarm, and\r\nbecause they believed the enemy had come into the field in very superior\r\nnumbers, behaved at first with but little spirit; but presently, when\r\nthey recovered their courage, they flew again to arms, and being roused\r\nby the sound of the trumpets, they hastened to the charge with\r\nthreatening cries, upon which the Persians retired to the garrison\r\nwithout further contest.\r\n\r\n10. And the emperor, being terribly angry, reduced those of the cavalry\r\nwho had shown a want of courage when attacked to serve in the infantry,\r\nwhich is a severer service and one of less honour.\r\n\r\n11. Then, being very eager to take a castle where he had incurred so\r\nmuch danger, he devoted all his own labour and care to that end, never\r\nhimself retiring from the front ranks of his men, in order that by\r\nfighting in the van he might be an example of gallantry to his soldiers,\r\nand might be also sure to see, and therefore able to reward, every\r\ngallant action. And when he had exposed himself a long time to imminent\r\ndanger, the castle, having been assailed by every kind of manoeuvre,\r\nweapon, and engine, and by great valour on the part of the besiegers,\r\nwas at length taken and burnt.\r\n\r\n12. After this, in consideration of the great labour of the exploits\r\nwhich they had performed, and which were before them, he granted rest to\r\nhis army, exhausted with its excessive toil, and distributed among them\r\nprovisions in abundance. Then a rampart was raised round the camp, with\r\ndense rows of palisades, and a deep fosse, as sudden sallies and various\r\nformidable manoeuvres were dreaded, since they were very near\r\nCtesiphon.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n§ 1. From this place they advanced to a canal known as Naharmalcha, a\r\nname which means \"The River of Kings.\" It was then dry. Long ago Trajan,\r\nand after him Severus, had caused the soil to be dug out, and had given\r\ngreat attention to constructing this as a canal of great size, so that,\r\nbeing filled with water from the Euphrates, it might enable vessels to\r\npass into the Tigris.\r\n\r\n2. And for every object in view it appeared best that this should now be\r\ncleaned out, as the Persians, fearing such an operation, had blocked it\r\nup with a mass of stones. After it had been cleared and the dams\r\nremoved, a large body of water was let in, so that our fleet, after a\r\nsafe voyage of thirty furlongs, passed into the Tigris. There the army\r\nat once threw bridges across the river, and passing over to the other\r\nside, marched upon Coche.\r\n\r\n3. And that after our fatigue we might enjoy seasonable rest, we\r\nencamped in an open plain, rich with trees, vines, and cypresses, in the\r\nmiddle of which was a shady and delicious pavilion, having all over it,\r\naccording to the fashion of the country, pictures of the king slaying\r\nwild beasts in the chase; for they never paint or in any way represent\r\nanything except different kinds of slaughter and war.\r\n\r\n4. Having now finished everything according to his wish, the emperor,\r\nrising higher in spirit as his difficulties increased, and building such\r\nhopes on Fortune, which had not yet proved unfavourable to him, that he\r\noften pushed his boldness to the verge of temerity, unloaded some of the\r\nstrongest of the vessels which were carrying provisions and warlike\r\nengines, and put on board of them eight hundred armed men; and keeping\r\nthe main part of the fleet with him, which he divided into three\r\nsquadrons, he settled that one under the command of Count Victor should\r\nstart at nightfall, in order to cross the river with speed, and so seize\r\non the bank in possession of the enemy.\r\n\r\n5. The generals were greatly alarmed at this plan, and unanimously\r\nentreated him to forego it; but as they could not prevail, the signal\r\nfor sailing was raised, as he commanded, and at once five ships hastened\r\nonwards out of sight; and when they drew near to the bank they were\r\nattacked with an incessant storm of fire-pots and every kind of\r\ncontrivance to handle flames, and they would have been burnt soldiers\r\nand all if the emperor, being roused, had not with great energy hastened\r\nto the spot, shouting out that our men, as they were ordered, had made\r\nhim a signal that they were now masters of the bank of the river, and\r\nordering the whole fleet to hasten forward with all speed.\r\n\r\n6. In consequence of which vigour the ships were saved, and the\r\nsoldiers, though harassed by the enemy from their commanding ground with\r\nstones and every kind of missile, nevertheless after a fierce conflict\r\nmade good their footing on the high bank of the river, and established\r\nthemselves immovably.\r\n\r\n7. History marvels that Sertorius swam across the Rhone with his arms\r\nand his breastplate; but on this occasion, some soldiers, though\r\ndisordered, fearing to remain behind after the signal for battle was\r\nraised, clinging firmly to their shields, which are broad and concave,\r\nand guiding them, though without much skill, kept pace with the speed of\r\nthe vessels through a river full of currents.\r\n\r\n8. The Persians resisted this attack with squadrons of cuirassier\r\ncavalry in such close order that their bodies dazzled the eye, fitting\r\ntogether, as it seemed, with their brilliant armour; while their horses\r\nwere all protected with a covering of stout leather. As a reserve to\r\nsupport them several maniples of infantry were stationed, protected by\r\ncrooked, oblong shields, made of wicker-work and raw hides, behind which\r\nthey moved in compact order. Behind them were elephants, like so many\r\nwalking hills, which by every motion of their huge bodies threatened\r\ndestruction to all who came near them, and our men had been taught to\r\nfear them by past experience.\r\n\r\n9. On this the emperor, according to the arrangement of the Greek army\r\nas mentioned by Homer,[150] allotted the centre space between his two\r\nlines to his weakest infantry, lest if they were placed in the front\r\nrank, and should then misbehave, they should disorder the whole of his\r\nline; or lest, on the other hand, if posted in the rear, behind all the\r\nother centuries, they should flee without shame, since there would be no\r\none to check them: he with his light-armed auxiliaries moving as might\r\nbe required between the lines.\r\n\r\n10. Therefore when the two armies beheld each other, the Romans\r\nglittering with their crested helmets, and brandishing their shields,\r\nproceeded slowly, their bands playing an anapæstic measure; and after a\r\npreliminary skirmish, carried on by the missiles of the front rank, they\r\nrushed to battle with such vehemence that the earth trembled beneath\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n11. The battle-shout was raised on all sides, as was usual, the braying\r\ntrumpets encouraged the eagerness of the men: all fought in close combat\r\nwith spears and drawn swords, so that the soldiers were free from all\r\ndanger of arrows the more rapidly they pressed onwards. Meanwhile,\r\nJulian, like a gallant comrade, at the same time that he was a skilful\r\ngeneral, hasten to support his hardly-pressed battalions with reserves,\r\nand to cheer on the laggards.\r\n\r\n12. So the front line of the Persians wavered, having been never very\r\nfierce; and at last, no longer able to support the heat of their armour,\r\nthey retreated in haste to their city, which was near: they were pursued\r\nby our soldiers, weary as they were with having fought in those torrid\r\nplains from daybreak to sunset; and we, pressing close on their heels,\r\ndrove them, with their choicest generals, Pigranes, the Surena, and\r\nNarses, right up to the walls of Ctesiphon, inflicting many wounds on\r\ntheir legs and backs.\r\n\r\n13. And we should have forced our entrance into the city if a general\r\nnamed Victor had not, by lifting up his hands and his voice, checked us,\r\nbeing himself pierced through the shoulder with an arrow, and fearing\r\nlest if the soldiers allowed themselves to be hurried within the walls\r\nwithout any order, and could then find no means of returning, they might\r\nbe overwhelmed by the mass of their enemies.\r\n\r\n14. Let the poets celebrate the ancient battles of Hector, or extol the\r\nvalour of the Thessalian Achilles; let past ages tell the praises of\r\nSophanes, and Aminias, and Callimachus, and Cynægirus, those\r\nthunderbolts of war in the struggles of the Greeks against Persia; but\r\nit is evident by the confession of all men that the gallantry displayed\r\nby some of our troops on that day was equal to any of their exploits.\r\n\r\n15. After having laid aside their fears, and trampled on the carcases of\r\ntheir enemies, the soldiers, still stained with the blood so justly\r\nshed, collected round the tent of the emperor, loading him with praises\r\nand thanks, because, while behaving with such bravery that it was hard\r\nto say whether he had been more a general or a soldier, he had conducted\r\nthe affair with such success that not above seventy of our men had\r\nfallen, while nearly two thousand five hundred of the Persians had been\r\nslain. And he in his turn addressed by name most of those whose steady\r\ncourage and gallant actions he had witnessed, presenting them with\r\nnaval, civic, and military crowns.\r\n\r\n16. Thinking that this achievement would surely be followed by other\r\nsimilar successes, he prepared a large sacrifice to Mars the Avenger.\r\nTen most beautiful bulls were brought for the purpose, nine of which,\r\neven before they reached the altars, lay down of their own accord with\r\nmournful countenances, but the tenth broke his bonds and escaped, and\r\nwas with difficulty brought back at all; and when sacrificed displayed\r\nvery unfavourable omens; but when he saw this, Julian became very\r\nindignant, and exclaimed, calling Jupiter to witness, that henceforth he\r\nwould offer no sacrifices to Mars. Nor did he recall his vow, being cut\r\noff by a speedy death.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. Julian, having discussed with his chief officers the plan for the\r\nsiege of Ctesiphon, it appeared to some of them that it would be an act\r\nof unseasonable temerity to attack that city, both because its situation\r\nmade it almost impregnable, and also because King Sapor was believed to\r\nbe hastening to its protection with a formidable army.\r\n\r\n2. The better opinion prevailed; and the sagacious emperor being\r\nconvinced of its wisdom, sent Arinthæus with a division of light\r\ninfantry, to lay waste the surrounding districts, which were rich both\r\nin herds and in crops, with orders also to pursue the enemy with equal\r\nenergy, for many of them were wandering about, concealed amid overgrown\r\nby-ways, and lurking-places known only to themselves. The booty was\r\nabundant.\r\n\r\n3. But Julian himself, being always eager to extend his conquests,\r\ndisregarded the advice of those who remonstrated against his advance;\r\nand reproaching his chiefs, as men who out of mere laziness and a love\r\nof ease advised him to let go the kingdom of Persia when he had almost\r\nmade himself master of it, left the river on his left hand, and led by\r\nunlucky guides, determined to proceed towards the inland parts of the\r\ncountry by forced marches.\r\n\r\n4. And he ordered all his ships to be burnt, as if with the fatal torch\r\nof Bellona herself, except twelve of the smaller vessels, which he\r\narranged should be carried on waggons, as likely to be of use for\r\nbuilding bridges. And he thought this a most excellently conceived plan,\r\nto prevent his fleet if left behind from being of any use to the enemy,\r\nor on the other hand to prevent what happened at the outset of the\r\nexpedition, nearly twenty thousand men being occupied in moving and\r\nmanaging the vessels.\r\n\r\n5. Then, as the men began in their alarm to grumble to themselves (as\r\nindeed manifest truth pointed out), that the soldiers if hindered from\r\nadvancing by the height of the mountains or the dryness of the country,\r\nwould have no means of returning to get water, and when the deserters,\r\non being put to the torture openly confessed that they had made a false\r\nreport, he ordered all hands to labour to extinguish the flames. But the\r\nfire, having got to a great head, had consumed most of them, so that\r\nonly the twelve could be preserved unhurt, which were set apart to be\r\ntaken care of.\r\n\r\n6. In this way the fleet being unseasonably destroyed, Julian, relying\r\non his army which was now all united, having none of its divisions\r\ndiverted to other occupations, and so being strong in numbers, advanced\r\ninland, the rich district through which he marched supplying him with an\r\nabundance of provisions.\r\n\r\n7. When this was known, the enemy, with a view to distressing us by want\r\nof supplies, burnt up all the grass and the nearly ripe crops; and we,\r\nbeing unable to advance by reason of the conflagration, remained\r\nstationary in our camp till the fire was exhausted. And the Persians,\r\ninsulting us from a distance, sometimes spread themselves widely on\r\npurpose, sometimes offered us resistance in a compact body; so that to\r\nus who beheld them from a distance it might seem that the reinforcements\r\nof the king had come up, and we might imagine that it was on that\r\naccount that they had ventured on their audacious sallies and unwonted\r\nenterprises.\r\n\r\n8. Both the emperor and the troops were greatly vexed at this, because\r\nthey had no means of constructing a bridge, since the ships had been\r\ninconsiderately destroyed, nor could any check be offered to the\r\nmovements of the strange enemy, whom the glistening brilliancy of their\r\narms showed to be close at hand; this armour of theirs being singularly\r\nadapted to all the inflections of their body. There was another evil of\r\nno small weight, that the reinforcements which we were expecting to\r\narrive under the command of Arsaces and some of our own generals, did\r\nnot make their appearance, being detained by the causes already\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. The emperor, to comfort his soldiers who were made anxious by these\r\nevents, ordered the prisoners who were of slender make, as the Persians\r\nusually are, and who were now more than usually emaciated, to be brought\r\nbefore the army; and looking at our men he said, \"Behold what those\r\nwarlike spirits consider men, little ugly dirty goats; and creatures\r\nwho, as many events have shown, throw away their arms and take to flight\r\nbefore they can come to blows.\"\r\n\r\n2. And when he had said this, and had ordered the prisoners to be\r\nremoved, he held a consultation on what was to be done; and after many\r\nopinions of different kinds had been delivered, the common soldiers\r\ninconsiderately crying out that it was best to return by the same way\r\nthey had advanced, the emperor steadily opposed this idea, and was\r\njoined by several officers who contended that this could not be done,\r\nsince all the forage and crops had been destroyed throughout the plain,\r\nand the remains of the villages which had been burnt were all in\r\ncomplete destitution, and could afford no supplies; because also the\r\nwhole soil was soaked everywhere from the snows of winter, and the\r\nrivers had overflowed their banks and were now formidable torrents.\r\n\r\n3. There was this further difficulty, that in those districts where the\r\nheat and evaporation are great, every place is infested with swarms of\r\nflies and gnats, and in such numbers that the light of the sun and of\r\nthe stars is completely hidden by them.\r\n\r\n4. And as human sagacity was of no avail in such a state of affairs, we\r\nwere long in doubt and perplexity; and raising altars and sacrificing\r\nvictims we consulted the will of the gods; inquiring whether it was\r\ntheir will that we should return through Assyria, or advancing slowly\r\nalong the foot of the mountain chain, should surprise and plunder\r\nChiliocomum near Corduena; but neither of these plans was conformable to\r\nthe omens presented by an inspection of the sacrifices.\r\n\r\n5. However it was decided, that since there was no better prospect\r\nbefore us, to seize on Corduena; and on the 16th June we struck our\r\ncamp, and at daybreak the emperor set forth, when suddenly was seen\r\neither smoke or a great cloud of dust; so that many thought it was\r\ncaused by herds of wild asses, of which there are countless numbers in\r\nthose regions, and who were now moving in a troop, in order by their\r\ncompactness to ward off the ferocious attacks of lions.\r\n\r\n6. Some, however, fancied that it was caused by the approach of the\r\nSaracen chieftains, our allies, who had heard that the emperor was\r\nbesieging Ctesiphon in great force: some again affirmed that the\r\nPersians were lying in wait for us on our march.\r\n\r\n7. Therefore amid all these doubtful opinions, the trumpets sounded a\r\nhalt, in order to guard against any reverse, and we halted in a grassy\r\nvalley near a stream, where, packing our shields in close order and in a\r\ncircular figure, we pitched our camp and rested in safety. Nor, so dark\r\ndid it continue till evening, could we distinguish what it was that had\r\nso long obscured the view.\r\n\r\n\r\n[149] Small boats made of wicker and covered with hide; still used in\r\nWales, where they are also called thorricle, truckle, or cobble.\r\n\r\n[150] See Il. iv. 297:--\r\n\r\n  +Ippêas men prôpa syn hippoisin kai ochesphin\r\n  pezous d' exopithen stêsen poleas te kai esthlous\r\n  erkos emen polemoio, kakous d' eis messon elassen.+\r\n\r\nThus translated by Pope:--\r\n\r\n  \"The horse and chariots to the front assigned,\r\n  The foot (the strength of war) he placed behind;\r\n  The middle space suspected troops supply,\r\n  Enclosed by both, nor left the power to fly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK XXV.\r\n\r\nARGUMENT.\r\n\r\n     I.

Bineses, a noble Persian,\r\n     acting for Sapor, receives from Jovian the impregnable city of\r\n     Nisibis; the citizens are unwilling to quit their country, but are\r\n     compelled to migrate to Amida--Five provinces, with the city of\r\n     Singara, and sixteen fortresses, are, according to the terms of the\r\n     treaty, handed over to the Persian nobles.--X. Jovian, fearing a\r\n     revolution, marches with great speed through Syria, Cilicia,\r\n     Cappadocia, and Galatia, and at Ancyra enters on the consulship,\r\n     with his infant son Varronianus, and soon afterwards dies suddenly\r\n     at Dadastana.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nA.D. 363.\r\n\r\n§ 1. The night was dark and starless, and passed by us as nights are\r\npassed in times of difficulty and perplexity; no one out of fear daring\r\nto sit down, or to close his eyes. But as soon as day broke, brilliant\r\nbreastplates surrounded with steel fringes, and glittering cuirasses,\r\nwere seen at a distance, and showed that the king's army was at hand.\r\n\r\n2. The soldiers were roused at this sight, and hastened to engage,\r\nsince only a small stream separated them from the Persians, but were\r\nchecked by the emperor; a sharp skirmish did indeed take place between\r\nour outposts and the Persians, close to the rampart of our camp, in\r\nwhich Machamæus, the captain of one of our squadrons was stricken down:\r\nhis brother Maurus, afterwards Duke of Phoenicia, flew to his support,\r\nand slew the man who had killed Machamæus, and crushed all who came in\r\nhis way, till he himself was wounded in the shoulder by a javelin; but\r\nhe still was able by great exertions to bring off his brother, who was\r\nnow pale with approaching death.\r\n\r\n3. Both sides were nearly exhausted with the intolerable violence of the\r\nheat and the repeated conflicts, but at last the hostile battalions were\r\ndriven back in great disorder. Then while we fell back to a greater\r\ndistance, the Saracens were also compelled to retreat from fear of our\r\ninfantry, but presently afterwards joining themselves to the Persian\r\nhost, they attacked us again, with more safety to themselves for the\r\npurpose of carrying off the Roman baggage. But when they saw the emperor\r\nthey again retreated upon their reserve.\r\n\r\n4. After leaving this district we reached a village called Hucumbra,\r\nwhere we rested two days, procuring all kinds of provisions and\r\nabundance of corn, so that we moved on again after being refreshed\r\nbeyond our hopes; all that the time would not allow us to take away we\r\nburnt.\r\n\r\n5. The next day the army was advancing more quietly, when the Persians\r\nunexpectedly fell upon our last division, to whom that day the duty fell\r\nof bringing up the rear, and would easily have slain all the men, had\r\nnot our cavalry, which happened to be at hand, the moment that they\r\nheard what was going on, hastened up, though scattered over the wide\r\nvalley, and repulsed this dangerous attack, wounding all who had thus\r\nsurprised them.\r\n\r\n6. In this skirmish fell Adaces, a noble satrap, who had formerly been\r\nsent as ambassador to the emperor Constantius, and had been kindly\r\nreceived by him. The soldier who slew him brought his arms to Julian,\r\nand received the reward he deserved.\r\n\r\n7. The same day one of our corps of cavalry, known as the third legion,\r\nwas accused of having gradually given way, so that when the legions were\r\non the point of breaking the enemy's line, they nearly broke the spirit\r\nof the whole army.\r\n\r\n8. And Julian, being justly indignant at this, deprived them of their\r\nstandards, broke their spears, and condemned all those who were\r\nconvicted of having misbehaved of marching among the baggage and\r\nprisoners; while their captain, the only one of their number who had\r\nbehaved well, was appointed to the command of another squadron, the\r\ntribune of which was convicted of having shamefully left the field.\r\n\r\n9. And four other tribunes of companies were also cashiered for similar\r\nmisconduct; for the emperor was contented with this moderate degree of\r\npunishment out of consideration for his impending difficulties.\r\n\r\n10. Accordingly, having advanced seventy furlongs with very scanty\r\nsupplies, the herbage and the corn being all burnt, each man saved for\r\nhimself just as much of the grain or forage as he could snatch from the\r\nflames and carry.\r\n\r\n11. And having left this spot, when the army had arrived at the district\r\ncalled Maranx, near daybreak an immense multitude of Persians appeared,\r\nwith Merenes, the captain of their cavalry, and two sons of the king,\r\nand many nobles.\r\n\r\n12. All the troops were clothed in steel, in such a way that their\r\nbodies were covered with strong plates, so that the hard joints of the\r\narmour fitted every limb of their bodies; and on their heads were\r\neffigies of human faces so accurately fitted, that their whole persons\r\nbeing covered with metal, the only place where any missiles which fell\r\nupon them could stick, was either where there were minute openings to\r\nallow of the sight of the eyes penetrating, or where holes for breathing\r\nwere left at the extremities of the nostrils.\r\n\r\n13. Part of them who were prepared to fight with pikes stood immovable,\r\nso that you might have fancied they were held in their places by\r\nfastenings of brass; and next to them the archers (in which art that\r\nnation has always been most skilful from the cradle) bent their supple\r\nbows with widely extended arms, so that the strings touched their right\r\nbreasts, while the arrows lay just upon their left hands; and the\r\nwhistling arrows flew, let loose with great skill of finger, bearing\r\ndeadly wounds.\r\n\r\n14. Behind them stood the glittering elephants in formidable array,\r\nwhose grim looks our terrified men could hardly endure; while the horses\r\nwere still more alarmed at their growl, odour, and unwonted aspect.\r\n\r\n15. Their drivers rode on them, and bore knives with handles fastened to\r\ntheir right hands, remembering the disaster which they had experienced\r\nat Nisibis; and if the ferocious animal overpowered his overseer, they\r\npierced the spine where the head is joined to the neck with a vigorous\r\nblow, that the beast might not recoil upon their own ranks, as had\r\nhappened on that occasion, and trample down their own people; for it was\r\nfound out by Hasdrubal, the brother of Hannibal, that in this way these\r\nanimals might be very easily deprived of life.\r\n\r\n16. The sight of these beasts caused great alarm; and so this most\r\nintrepid emperor, attended with a strong body of his armed cohorts and\r\nmany of his chief officers, as the crisis and the superior numbers of\r\nthe enemy required, marshalled his troops in the form of a crescent with\r\nthe wings bending inwards to encounter the enemy.\r\n\r\n17. And to hinder the onset of the archers from disordering our columns,\r\nby advancing with great speed he baffled the aim of their arrows; and\r\nafter he had given the formal signal for fighting, the Roman infantry,\r\nin close order, beat back the front of the enemy with a vigorous effort.\r\n\r\n18. The struggle was fierce, and the clashing of the shields, the din of\r\nthe men, and the doleful whistle of the javelins, which continued\r\nwithout intermission, covered the plains with blood and corpses, the\r\nPersians falling in every direction; and though they were often slack in\r\nfighting, being accustomed chiefly to combat at a distance by means of\r\nmissiles, still now foot to foot they made a stout resistance; and when\r\nthey found any of their divisions giving way, they retreated like rain\r\nbefore the wind, still with showers of arrows seeking to deter their\r\nfoes from pursuing them. So the Parthians were defeated by prodigious\r\nefforts, till our soldiers, exhausted by the heat of the day, on the\r\nsignal for retreat being sounded, returned to their camp, encouraged\r\nfor the future to greater deeds of daring.\r\n\r\n19. In this battle, as I have said, the loss of the Persians was very\r\ngreat--ours was very slight. But the most important death in our ranks\r\nwas that of Vetranio, a gallant soldier who commanded the legion of\r\nZianni.[152]\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. After this there was an armistice for three days, while the men\r\nattended to their own wounds or those of their friends, during which we\r\nwere destitute of supplies, and distressed by intolerable hunger; and\r\nsince, as all the corn and forage was burnt, both men and cattle were in\r\nextreme danger of starvation, a portion of the food which the horses of\r\nthe tribunes and superior officers were carrying was distributed among\r\nthe lower classes of the soldiers, who were in extreme want.\r\n\r\n2. And the emperor, who had no royal dainties prepared for himself, but\r\nwho was intending to sup under the props of a small tent on a scanty\r\nportion of pulse, such as would often have been despised by a prosperous\r\ncommon soldier, indifferent to his own comfort, distributed what was\r\nprepared for him among the poorest of his comrades.\r\n\r\n3. He gave a short time to anxious and troubled sleep; and when he\r\nawoke, and, as was his custom, began to write something in his tent, in\r\nimitation of Julius Cæsar, while the night was still dark, being\r\noccupied with the consideration of the writings of some philosophers, he\r\nsaw, as he told his friends, in mournful guise, the vision of the Genius\r\nof the Empire, whom, when he first became emperor, he had seen in Gaul,\r\nsorrowfully departing through the curtains of his tent with the\r\ncornucopia, which he bore in his hand veiled, as well as his head.\r\n\r\n4. And although for a moment he stood stupefied, yet being above all\r\nfear, he commended the future to the will of heaven; and leaving his\r\nbed, which was made on the ground, he rose, while it was still but\r\nlittle past midnight, and supplicating the deities with sacred rites to\r\navert misfortune, he thought he saw a bright torch, falling, cut a\r\npassage through the air and vanish from his sight; and then he was\r\nhorror-stricken, fearing that the star of Mars had appeared openly\r\nthreatening him.\r\n\r\n5. For this brightness was of the kind which we call [Greek:\r\ndiaissonta], not falling down or reaching the ground. Indeed, he who\r\nthinks that solid substances can fall from heaven is rightly accounted\r\nprofane and mad. But these occurrences take place in many ways, of which\r\nit will be enough to enumerate a few.\r\n\r\n6. Some think that sparks falling off from the ethereal fire, as they\r\nare able to proceed but a short distance, soon become extinguished; or,\r\nperhaps, that rays of fire coming against the dense clouds, sparkle from\r\nthe suddenness of the contact; or that some light attaches itself to a\r\ncloud, and taking the form of a star, runs on as long as it is supported\r\nby the power of the fire; but being presently exhausted by the magnitude\r\nof the space which it traverses, it becomes dissolved into air, passing\r\ninto that substance from the excessive attrition of which it originally\r\nderived its heat.\r\n\r\n7. Therefore, without loss of time, before daybreak, he sent for the\r\nEtruscan soothsayers, and consulted them what this new kind of star\r\nportended; who replied, that he must cautiously avoid attempting any new\r\nenterprise at present, showing that it was laid down in the works of\r\nTarquitius,[153] \"on divine affairs,\" that when a light of this kind is\r\nseen in heaven, no battle ought to be engaged in, or any similar measure\r\nbe undertaken.\r\n\r\n8. But as he despised this and many other similar warnings, the diviners\r\nat least entreated him to delay his march for some hours; but they could\r\nnot prevail even to this extent, as the emperor was always opposed to\r\nthe whole science of divination. So at break of day the camp was struck.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. When we set forward, the Persians, who had learnt by their frequent\r\ndefeats to shun pitched battles, laid secret ambuscades on our road,\r\nand, occupying the hills on each side, continually reconnoitred our\r\nbattalions as they marched, so that our soldiers, being kept all day on\r\nthe watch, could neither find time to erect ramparts round their camp,\r\nor to fortify themselves with palisades.\r\n\r\n2. And while our flanks were strongly guarded, and the army proceeded\r\nonward in as good order as the nature of the ground would allow, being\r\nformed in squares, though not quite closed up, suddenly news was brought\r\nto the emperor, who had gone on unarmed to reconnoitre the ground in\r\nfront, that our rear was attacked.\r\n\r\n3. He, roused to anger by this mishap, without stopping to put on his\r\nbreastplate, snatched up his shield in a hurry, and while hastening to\r\nsupport his rear, was recalled by fresh news that the van which he had\r\nquitted was now exposed to a similar attack.\r\n\r\n4. Without a thought of personal danger, he now hastened to strengthen\r\nthis division, and then, on another side, a troop of Persian cuirassiers\r\nattacked his centre, and pouring down with vehemence on his left wing,\r\nwhich began to give way, as our men could hardly bear up against the\r\nfoul smell and horrid cries of the elephants, they pressed us hard with\r\nspears and clouds of arrows.\r\n\r\n5. The emperor flew to every part of the field where the danger was\r\nhottest; and our light-armed troops dashing out wounded the backs of the\r\nPersians, and the hocks of the animals, which were turned the other way.\r\n\r\n6. Julian, disregarding all care for his own safety, made signs by\r\nwaving his hands, and shouted out that the enemy were fleeing in\r\nconsternation; and cheering on his men to the pursuit, threw himself\r\neagerly into the conflict. His guards called out to him from all sides\r\nto beware of the mass of fugitives who were scattered in consternation,\r\nas he would beware of the fall of an ill-built roof, when suddenly a\r\ncavalry spear, grazing the skin of his arm, pierced his side, and fixed\r\nitself in the bottom of his liver.\r\n\r\n7. He tried to pull it out with his right hand, and cut the sinews of\r\nhis fingers with the double-edged point of the weapon; and, falling from\r\nhis horse, he was borne with speed by the men around him to his tent;\r\nand the physician tried to relieve him.\r\n\r\n8. Presently, when his pain was somewhat mitigated, so that his\r\napprehensions were relieved, contending against death with great\r\nenergy, he asked for arms and a horse in order that, by revisiting his\r\ntroops, who were still engaged, he might restore their confidence, and\r\nappear so secure of his own recovery as to have room for anxiety for the\r\nsafety of others; with the same energy though with a different object,\r\nwith which the celebrated leader, Epaminondas, when he was mortally\r\nwounded at Mantinea, and had been borne out of the battle, asked\r\nanxiously for his shield; and when he saw it he died of his wound\r\ncheerfully, having been in fear for the loss of his shield, while quite\r\nfearless about the loss of his life.\r\n\r\n9. But as Julian's strength was inferior to his firmness, and as he was\r\nweakened by the loss of blood, he remained without moving: and presently\r\nhe gave up all hope of life; because, on inquiry, he found that the\r\nplace where he had fallen was called Phrygia; for he had been assured by\r\nan oracle that he was destined to die in Phrygia.\r\n\r\n10. When he was brought back to his tent, it was marvellous with what\r\neagerness the soldiers flew to avenge him, agitated with anger and\r\nsorrow; and striking their spears against their shields, determined to\r\ndie if Fate so willed it. And although vast clouds of dust obscured\r\ntheir sight, and the burning heat hindered the activity of their\r\nmovements, still, as if they were released from all military discipline\r\nby the loss of their chief, they rushed unshrinkingly on the enemy's\r\nswords.\r\n\r\n11. On the other hand the Persians, fighting with increased spirit, shot\r\nforth such clouds of arrows, that we could hardly see the shooters\r\nthrough them; while the elephants, slowly marching in front, by the vast\r\nsize of their bodies, and the formidable appearance of their crests,\r\nterrified alike our horses and our men.\r\n\r\n12. And far off was heard the clashing of armed men, the groans of the\r\ndying, the snorting of the horses, and the clang of swords, till both\r\nsides were weary of inflicting wounds, and the darkness of night put an\r\nend to the contest.\r\n\r\n13. Fifty nobles and satraps of the Persians, with a vast number of the\r\ncommon soldiers, were slain; and among them, two of their principal\r\ngenerals, Merena and Nohodares. Let the grandiloquence of antiquity\r\nmarvel at the twenty battles fought by Marcellus in different places;\r\nlet it add Sicinius Dentatus, adorned with his mass of military crowns;\r\nlet it further extol Sergius, who is said to have received twenty-three\r\nwounds in his different battles, among whose posterity was that last\r\nCatiline, who tarnished the glories of his distinguished family by\r\neverlasting infamy.\r\n\r\n14. But sorrow now overpowered the joy at this success. While the\r\nconflict was thus carried on after the withdrawal of the emperor, the\r\nright wing of the army was exhausted by its exertions; and Anatolius, at\r\nthat time the master of the offices, was killed; Sallust the prefect was\r\nin imminent danger, and was saved only by the exertions of his\r\nattendant, so that at last he escaped, while Sophorius his counsellor\r\nwas killed; and certain soldiers, who, after great danger, had thrown\r\nthemselves into a neighbouring fort, were unable to rejoin the main army\r\ntill three days afterwards.\r\n\r\n15. And while these events were taking place, Julian, lying in his tent,\r\nthus addressed those who stood around him sorrowing and mourning: \"The\r\nseasonable moment for my surrendering this life, O comrades, has now\r\narrived, and, like an honest debtor, I exult in preparing to restore\r\nwhat nature reclaims; not in affliction and sorrow, since I have learnt,\r\nfrom the general teaching of philosophers, how much more capable of\r\nhappiness the mind is than the body; and considering that when the\r\nbetter part is separated from the worse, it is a subject of joy rather\r\nthan of mourning. Reflecting, also, that there have been instances in\r\nwhich even the gods have given to some persons of extreme piety, death\r\nas the best of all rewards.\r\n\r\n16. \"And I well know that it is intended as a gift of kindness to me, to\r\nsave me from yielding to arduous difficulties, and from forgetting or\r\nlosing myself; knowing by experience that all sorrows, while they\r\ntriumph over the weak, flee before those who endure them manfully.\r\n\r\n17. \"Nor have I to repent of any actions; nor am I oppressed by the\r\nrecollection of any grave crime, either when I was kept in the shade,\r\nand, as it were, in a corner, or after I arrived at the empire, which,\r\nas an honour conferred on me by the gods, I have preserved, as I\r\nbelieve, unstained. In civil affairs I have ruled with moderation and,\r\nwhether carrying on offensive or defensive war, have always been under\r\nthe influence of deliberate reason; prosperity, however, does not always\r\ncorrespond to the wisdom of man's counsels, since the powers above\r\nreserve to themselves the regulation of results.\r\n\r\n18. \"But always keeping in mind that the aim of a just sovereign is the\r\nadvantage and safety of his subjects, I have been always, as you know,\r\ninclined to peace, eradicating all licentiousness--that great\r\ncorruptress of things and manners--by every part of my own conduct; and\r\nI am glad to feel that in whatever instances the republic, like an\r\nimperious mother, has exposed me deliberately to danger, I have stood\r\nfirm, inured to brave all fortuitous disturbing events.\r\n\r\n19. \"Nor am I ashamed to confess that I have long known, from prophecy,\r\nthat I should fall by the sword. And therefore do I venerate the\r\neverlasting God that I now die, not by any secret treachery, nor by a\r\nlong or severe disease, or like a condemned criminal, but I quit the\r\nworld with honour, fairly earned, in the midst of a career of nourishing\r\nglory. For, to any impartial judge, that man is base and cowardly who\r\nseeks to die when he ought not, or who avoids death when it is\r\nseasonable for him.\r\n\r\n20. \"This is enough for me to say, since my strength is failing me; but\r\nI designedly forbear to speak of creating a new emperor, lest I should\r\nunintentionally pass over some worthy man; or, on the other hand, if I\r\nshould name one whom I think proper, I should expose him to danger in\r\nthe event of some one else being preferred. But, as an honest child of\r\nthe republic, I hope that a good sovereign will be found to succeed me.\"\r\n\r\n21. After having spoken quietly to this effect, he, as it were with the\r\nlast effort of his pen, distributed his private property among his\r\ndearest friends, asking for Anatolius, the master of the offices. And\r\nwhen the prefect Sallust replied that he was now happy, he understood\r\nthat he was slain, and bitterly bewailed the death of his friend, though\r\nhe had so proudly disregarded his own.\r\n\r\n22. And as all around were weeping, he reproved them with still\r\nundiminished authority, saying that it was a humiliating thing to mourn\r\nfor an emperor who was just united to heaven and the stars.\r\n\r\n23. And as they then became silent, he entered into an intricate\r\ndiscussion with the philosophers Maximus and Priscus on the sublime\r\nnature of the soul, while the wound of his pierced side was gaping wide.\r\nAt last the swelling of his veins began to choke his breath, and having\r\ndrank some cold water, which he had asked for, he expired quietly about\r\nmidnight, in the thirty-first year of his age. He was born at\r\nConstantinople, and in his childhood lost his father, Constantius, who,\r\nafter the death of his brother Constantine, perished amid the crowd of\r\ncompetitors for the vacant crown. And at the same early age he lost his\r\nmother, Basilina, a woman descended from a long line of noble ancestors.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n§ 1. Julian was a man to be classed with heroic characters, and\r\nconspicuous for the brilliancy of his exploits and his innate majesty.\r\nFor since, as wise men lay it down, there are four cardinal\r\nvirtues,--temperance, prudence, justice, and fortitude,--with\r\ncorresponding external accessaries, such as military skill, authority,\r\nprosperity, and liberality, he eagerly cultivated them all as if they\r\nhad been but one.\r\n\r\n2. And in the first place, he was of a chastity so inviolate that, after\r\nthe loss of his wife he never indulged in any sexual pleasures,\r\nrecollecting what is told in Plato of Sophocles the tragedian, that\r\nbeing asked when he was a very old man whether he still had any commerce\r\nwith women, he said \"No,\" with this further addition, that \"he was glad\r\nto say that he had at all times avoided such indulgence as a tyrannous\r\nand cruel master.\"\r\n\r\n3. And to strengthen this resolution he often called to mind the words\r\nof the lyric poet Bacchylides, whom he used to read with pleasure, and\r\nwho said that as a fine painter makes a handsome face, so chastity\r\nadorns a life that aims at greatness. And even when in the prime of life\r\nhe so carefully avoided this taint that there was never the least\r\nsuspicion of his becoming enamoured even of any of his household, as has\r\noften happened.\r\n\r\n4. And this kind of temperance increased in him, being strengthened by a\r\nsparing indulgence in eating and sleeping, to which he rigidly adhered\r\nwhether abroad or at home. For in time of peace his frugal allowance of\r\nfood was a marvel to all who knew him, as resembling that of a man\r\nalways wishing to resume the philosopher's cloak. And in his various\r\ncampaigns he used commonly only to take a little plain food while\r\nstanding, as is the custom of soldiers.\r\n\r\n5. And when after being fatigued by labour he had refreshed his body\r\nwith a short rest, as soon as he awoke he would go by himself round all\r\nthe sentries and outposts; after which he retired to his serious\r\nstudies.\r\n\r\n6. And if any voice could bear witness to his use of the nocturnal lamp,\r\nby which he pursued his lucubrations, it would show that there was a\r\nvast difference between some emperors and him, who did not even indulge\r\nhimself in those pleasures permitted by the necessities of human nature.\r\n\r\n7. Of his prudence there were also many proofs, of which it will be\r\nsufficient to recount a few. He was profoundly skilled in war, and also\r\nin the arts of peace. He was very attentive to courtesy, claiming just\r\nso much respect as he considered sufficient to mark the difference\r\nbetween contempt and insolence. He was older in virtue than in years,\r\nbeing eager to acquire all kinds of knowledge. He was a most\r\nincorruptible judge, a rigid censor of morals and manners, mild, a\r\ndespiser of riches, and indeed of all mortal things. Lastly, it was a\r\ncommon saying of his, \"That it was beneath a wise man, since he had a\r\nsoul, to aim at acquiring praise by his body.\"\r\n\r\n8. Of his justice there are many conspicuous proofs: first, because,\r\nwith all proper regard to circumstances and persons, he inspired awe\r\nwithout being cruel; secondly, because he repressed vice by making\r\nexamples of a few, and also because he threatened severe punishment more\r\nfrequently than he employed it.\r\n\r\n9. Lastly, to pass over many circumstances, it is certain that he\r\ntreated with extreme moderation some who were openly convicted of\r\nplotting against him, and mitigated the rigour of the punishment to\r\nwhich they were sentenced with genuine humanity.\r\n\r\n10. His many battles and constant wars displayed his fortitude, as did\r\nhis endurance of extreme cold and heat. From a common soldier we\r\nrequire the services of the body, from an emperor those of the mind. But\r\nhaving boldly thrown himself into battle, he would slay a ferocious foe\r\nat a single blow; and more than once he by himself checked the retreat\r\nof our men at his own personal risk. And when he was putting down the\r\nrule of the furious Germans, and also in the scorching sands of Persia,\r\nhe encouraged his men by fighting in the front ranks of his army.\r\n\r\n11. Many well-known facts attest his skill in all that concerns a camp;\r\nhis storming of cities and castles amid the most formidable dangers; the\r\nvariety of his tactics for battles, the skill he showed in choosing\r\nhealthy spots for his camps, the safe principles on which his lines of\r\ndefence and outposts were managed.\r\n\r\n12. So great was his authority, that while he was feared he was also\r\ngreatly loved as his men's comrade in their perils and dangers. And in\r\nthe hottest struggles he took notice of cowards for punishment. And\r\nwhile he was yet only Cæsar, he kept his soldiers in order while\r\nconfronting the barbarians, and destitute of pay as I have mentioned\r\nbefore. And haranguing his discontented troops, the threat which he used\r\nwas that he would retire into private life if they continued mutinous.\r\n\r\n13. Lastly, this single instance will do as well as many, by haranguing\r\nthe Gallic legions, who were accustomed to the frozen Rhine, in a simple\r\naddress, he persuaded them to traverse vast regions and to march through\r\nthe warm plains of Assyria to the borders of Media.\r\n\r\n14. His good fortune was so conspicuous that, riding as it were on the\r\nshoulders of Fortune, who was long his faithful guide, he overcame\r\nenormous difficulties in his victorious career. And after he quitted the\r\nregions of the west, they all remained quiet during his life-time, as if\r\nunder the influence of a wand powerful enough to tranquillize the world.\r\n\r\n15. Of his liberality there are many and undoubted proofs. Among which\r\nare his light exactions of tribute, his remission of the tribute of\r\ncrowns, and of debts long due, his putting the rights of individuals on\r\nan equal footing with those of the treasury, his restoration of their\r\nrevenues and their lands to different cities, with the exception of such\r\nas had been lawfully sold by former princes; and also the fact that he\r\nwas never covetous of money, which he thought was better kept by its\r\nowners, often quoting the saying, \"that Alexander the Great, when he was\r\nasked where he kept his treasures, kindly answered 'Among my friends.'\"\r\n\r\n16. Having discussed those of his good qualities which have come within\r\nour knowledge, let us now proceed to unfold his faults, though they have\r\nbeen already slightly noticed. He was of an unsteady disposition; but\r\nthis fault he corrected by an excellent plan, allowing people to set him\r\nright when guilty of indiscretion.\r\n\r\n17. He was a frequent talker, rarely silent. Too much devoted to\r\ndivination, so much so as in this particular to equal the emperor\r\nAdrian. He was rather a superstitious than a legitimate observer of\r\nsacred rites, sacrificing countless numbers of victims; so that it was\r\nreckoned that if he had returned from the Parthians there would have\r\nbeen a scarcity of cattle. Like the celebrated case of Marcus\r\nCæsar,[154] about whom it was written, as it is said, \"The white cattle\r\nto Marcus Cæsar, greeting. If you conquer there is an end of us.\"\r\n\r\n18. He was very fond of the applause of the common people, and an\r\nimmoderate seeker after praise even in the most trifling matters; often,\r\nfrom a desire of popularity, indulging in conversation with unworthy\r\npersons.\r\n\r\n19. But in spite of all this he deserved, as he used to say himself, to\r\nhave it thought that that ancient Justice, whom Aratus says fled to\r\nheaven from disgust with the vices of men, had in his reign returned\r\nagain to the earth; only that sometimes he acted arbitrarily and\r\ninconsistently.\r\n\r\n20. For he made some laws which, with but few exceptions, were not\r\noffensive, though they very positively enforced or forbade certain\r\nactions. Among the exceptions was that cruel one which forbade Christian\r\nmasters of rhetoric and grammar to teach unless they came over to the\r\nworship of the heathen gods.\r\n\r\n21. And this other ordinance was equally intolerable, namely one which\r\nallowed some persons to be unjustly enrolled in the companies of the\r\nmunicipal guilds, though they were foreigners, or by privilege or birth\r\nwholly unconnected with such companies.\r\n\r\n22. As to his personal appearance it was this. He was of moderate\r\nstature, with soft hair, as if he had carefully dressed it, with a rough\r\nbeard ending in a point, with beautiful brilliant eyes, which displayed\r\nthe subtlety of his mind, with handsome eyebrows and a straight nose, a\r\nrather large mouth, with a drooping lower lip, a thick and stooping\r\nneck, large and broad shoulders. From head to foot he was straight and\r\nwell proportioned, which made him strong and a good runner.\r\n\r\n23. And since his detractors have accused him of provoking new wars, to\r\nthe injury of the commonwealth, let them know the unquestionable truth,\r\nthat it was not Julian but Constantius who occasioned the hostility of\r\nthe Parthians by greedily acquiescing in the falsehoods of Metrodorus,\r\nas we have already set forth.\r\n\r\n24. In consequence of this conduct our armies were slain, numbers of our\r\nsoldiers were taken prisoners, cities were rased, fortresses were\r\nstormed and destroyed, provinces were exhausted by heavy expenses, and\r\nin short the Persians, putting their threats into effect, were led to\r\nseek to become masters of everything up to Bithynia and the shores of\r\nthe Propontis.\r\n\r\n25. While the Gallic wars grew more and more violent, the Germans\r\noverrunning our territories, and being on the point of forcing the\r\npasses of the Alps in order to invade Italy, there was nothing to be\r\nseen but tears and consternation, the recollection of the past being\r\nbitter, the expectation of the future still more woeful. All these\r\nmiseries, this youth, being sent into the West with the rank of Cæsar,\r\nput an end to with marvellous celerity, treating the kings of those\r\ncountries as base-born slaves.\r\n\r\n26. Then in order to re-establish the prosperity of the east, with\r\nsimilar energy he attacked the Persians, and would have gained in that\r\ncountry both a triumph and a surname, if the will of heaven had been in\r\naccordance with his glorious plans and actions.\r\n\r\n27. And as we know by experience that some men are so rash and hasty\r\nthat if conquered they return to battle, if shipwrecked, to the sea, in\r\nshort, each to the difficulties by which he has been frequently\r\novercome, so some find fault with this emperor for returning to similar\r\nexploits after having been repeatedly victorious.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n§ 1. After these events there was no time for lamentation or weeping.\r\nFor after he had been laid out as well as the circumstances and time\r\npermitted, that he might be buried where he himself had formerly\r\nproposed, at daybreak the next morning, which was on the 27th of June,\r\nwhile the enemy surrounded us on every side, the generals of the army\r\nassembled, and having convened the chief officers of the cavalry and of\r\nthe legions, deliberated about the election of an emperor.\r\n\r\n2. There were great and noisy divisions. Arinthæus and Victor, and the\r\nrest of those who had been attached to the court of Constantius, sought\r\nfor a fit man of their own party. On the other hand, Nevitta and\r\nDagalaiphus, and the nobles of the Gauls, sought for a man among their\r\nown ranks.\r\n\r\n3. While the matter was thus in dispute, they all unanimously agreed\r\nupon Sallustius. And when he pleaded ill health and old age, one of the\r\nsoldiers of rank observing his real and fixed reluctance said, \"And what\r\nwould you do if the emperor while absent himself, as has often happened,\r\nhad intrusted you with the conduct of this war? Would you not have\r\npostponed all other considerations and applied yourself to extricating\r\nthe soldiers at once from the difficulties which press on them? Do so\r\nnow: and then, if we are allowed to reach Mesopotamia, it will be time\r\nenough for the united suffrages of both armies to declare a lawful\r\nemperor.\"\r\n\r\n4. Amid these little delays in so important a matter, before opinions\r\nwere justly weighed, a few made an uproar, as often happens in critical\r\ncircumstances, and Jovian was elected emperor, being the chief officer\r\nof the guards, and a man of fair reputation in respect of his father's\r\nservices. For he was the son of Varronianus, a distinguished count,[155]\r\nwho had not long since retired from military service to lead a private\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n5. And immediately he was clothed in the imperial robes, and was\r\nsuddenly led forth out of the tent and passed at a quick pace through\r\nthe army as it was preparing to march.\r\n\r\n6. And as the line extended four miles, those in the van hearing some\r\npersons salute Jovian as Augustus, raised the same cry still more\r\nloudly, for they were caught by the relationship, so to say, of the\r\nname, which differed only by one letter from that of Julian, and so they\r\nthought that Julian was recovered and was being led forth with great\r\nacclamations as had often been the case. But when the new emperor, who\r\nwas both taller and less upright, was seen, they suspected what had\r\nhappened, and gave vent to tears and lamentations.\r\n\r\n7. And if any lover of justice should find fault with what was done at\r\nthis extreme crisis as imprudent, he might still more justly blame\r\nsailors who, having lost a skilful pilot when both winds and waves are\r\nagitated by a storm, commit the helm of their vessel to some one of\r\ntheir comrades.\r\n\r\n8. This affair having been thus settled by a blind sort of decision of\r\nFortune, the standard-bearer of the Jovian legion, which Varronianus had\r\nformerly commanded, having had a quarrel with the new emperor while he\r\nwas a private individual, because he had been a violent disparager of\r\nhis father, now fearing danger at his hand, since he had risen to a\r\nheight exceeding any ordinary fortune, fled to the Persians. And having\r\nbeen allowed to tell what he knew, he informed Sapor, who was at hand,\r\nthat the prince whom he dreaded was dead, and that Jovian, who had\r\nhitherto been only an officer of the guards, a man of neither energy nor\r\ncourage, had been raised by a mob of camp drudges to a kind of shadow of\r\nthe imperial authority.\r\n\r\n9. Sapor hearing this news, which he had always anxiously prayed for,\r\nand being elated by this unexpected good fortune, having reinforced the\r\ntroops who had fought against us with a strong body of the royal\r\ncavalry, sent them forward with speed to attack the rear of our army.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n§ 1. And while these arrangements were being made, the victims and\r\nentrails were inspected on behalf of Jovian, and it was pronounced that\r\nhe would ruin everything if he remained in the camp, as he proposed,\r\nbut that if he quitted it he would have the advantage.\r\n\r\n2. And just as we were beginning our march, the Persians attacked us,\r\npreceded by their elephants. Both our horses and men were at first\r\ndisordered by their roaring and formidable onset; but the Jovian and\r\nHerculean legions slew a few of the monsters, and made a gallant\r\nresistance to the mounted cuirassiers.\r\n\r\n3. Then the legions of the Jovii and Victores coming up to aid their\r\ncomrades, who were in distress, also slew two elephants and a great\r\nnumber of the enemy's troops. And on our left wing three most gallant\r\nmen were slain, Julian, Macrobius, and Maximus, all tribunes of the\r\nlegions which were then the chief of the whole army.\r\n\r\n4. When they were buried as well as circumstances permitted, as night\r\nwas drawing on, and as we were pressing forward with all speed towards a\r\nfort called Sumere, the dead body of Anatolius was recognized and buried\r\nwith a hurried funeral. Here also we were rejoined by sixty soldiers and\r\na party of the guards of the palace, whom we have mentioned as having\r\ntaken refuge in a fort called Vaccatum.\r\n\r\n5. Then on the following day we pitched our camp in a valley in as\r\nfavourable a spot as the nature of the ground permitted, surrounding it\r\nwith a rampart like a wall, with sharp stakes fixed all round like so\r\nmany swords, with the exception of one wide entrance.\r\n\r\n6. And when the enemy saw this they attacked us with all kinds of\r\nmissiles from their thickets, reproaching us also as traitors and\r\nmurderers of an excellent prince. For they had heard by the vague report\r\nof some deserters that Julian had fallen by the weapon of a Roman.\r\n\r\n7. And presently, while this was going on, a body of cavalry ventured to\r\nforce their way in by the Prætorian gate, and to advance almost up to\r\nthe emperor's tent. But they were vigorously repulsed with the loss of\r\nmany of their men killed and wounded.\r\n\r\n8. Quitting this camp, the next night we reached a place called Charcha,\r\nwhere we were safe, because the artificial mounds of the river had been\r\nbroken to prevent the Saracens from overrunning Armenia, so that no one\r\nwas able to harass our lines as they had done before.\r\n\r\n9. Then on the 1st of July we marched thirty furlongs more, and came to\r\na city called Dura, where our baggage-horses were so jaded, that their\r\ndrivers, being mostly recruits, marched on foot till they were hemmed in\r\nby a troop of Saracens; and they would all have been killed if some\r\nsquadrons of our light cavalry had not gone to their assistance in their\r\ndistress.\r\n\r\n10. We were exposed to the hostility of these Saracens because Julian\r\nhad forbidden that the presents and gratuities, to which they had been\r\naccustomed, should be given to them; and when they complained to him,\r\nthey were only told that a warlike and vigilant emperor had iron, not\r\ngold.\r\n\r\n11. Here, owing to the obstinate hostility of the Persians, we lost four\r\ndays. For when we advanced they followed us, compelling us to retrace\r\nour steps by their incessant attacks. When we halted gradually to fight,\r\nthey retired, tormenting us by their long delay. And now (for when men\r\nare in great fear even falsehoods please them) a report being spread\r\nthat we were at no great distance from our own frontier, the army raised\r\nan impatient shout, and demanded to be at once led across the Tigris.\r\n\r\n12. But the emperor and his officers opposed this demand, and showed\r\nthem that the river, now just at the time of the rising of the Dogstar,\r\nwas much flooded, entreated them not to trust themselves to its\r\ndangerous currents, reminding them that most of them could not swim, and\r\nadding likewise that the enemy had occupied the banks of the river,\r\nswoln as it was at many parts.\r\n\r\n13. But when the demand was repeated over and over again in the camp,\r\nand the soldiers with shouts and great eagerness began to threaten\r\nviolence, the order was given very unwillingly that the Gauls, mingled\r\nwith the northern Germans, should lead the way into the river, in order\r\nthat if they were carried away by the violence of the stream the\r\nobstinacy of the rest might be shaken; or on the other hand, if they\r\naccomplished the passage in safety the rest might attempt it with more\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\n14. And men were selected suited to such an enterprise, who from their\r\nchildhood had been accustomed in their native land to cross the greatest\r\nrivers. And when the darkness of night presented an opportunity for\r\nmaking the attempt unperceived, as if they had just escaped from a\r\nprison, they reached the opposite bank sooner than could have been\r\nexpected; and having beaten down and slain numbers of the Persians whom,\r\nthough they had been placed there to guard the passage, their fancied\r\nsecurity had lulled into a gentle slumber, they held up their hands, and\r\nshook their cloaks so as to give the concerted signal that their bold\r\nattempt had succeeded.\r\n\r\n15. And when the signal was seen, the soldiers became eager to cross,\r\nand could only be restrained by the promise of the engineers to make\r\nthem bridges by means of bladders and the hides of slaughtered animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. While these vain attempts were going on, king Sapor, both while at\r\na distance, and also when he approached, received from his scouts and\r\nfrom our deserters a true account of the gallant exploits of our men, of\r\nthe disgraceful slaughter of his own troops, and also of his elephants\r\nin greater numbers than he ever remembered to have lost before. And he\r\nheard also that the Roman army, being hardened by its continual labours\r\nsince the death of its glorious chief, did not now think so much, as\r\nthey said, of safety as of revenge; and were resolved to extricate\r\nthemselves from their difficulties either by a complete victory or by a\r\nglorious death.\r\n\r\n2. He looked on this news as formidable, being aware by experience that\r\nour troops who were scattered over these provinces could easily be\r\nassembled, and knowing also that his own troops after their heavy losses\r\nwere in a state of the greatest alarm; he also heard that we had in\r\nMesopotamia an army little inferior in numbers to that before him.\r\n\r\n3. And besides all this, his courage was damped by the fact of five\r\nhundred men having crossed that swollen river by swimming in perfect\r\nsafety, and having slain his guards, and so emboldening the rest of\r\ntheir comrades to similar hardihood.\r\n\r\n4. In the mean time, as the violence of the stream prevented any bridges\r\nfrom being constructed, and as everything which could be eaten was\r\nconsumed, we passed two days in great misery, and the starving soldiers\r\nbegan to be furious with rage, thinking it better to perish by the sword\r\nthan by hunger, that most degrading death.\r\n\r\n5. But the eternal providence of God was on our side, and beyond our\r\nhopes the Persians made the first overtures, sending the Surena and\r\nanother noble as ambassadors to treat for peace, and they themselves\r\nbeing in a state of despondency, as the Romans, having proved superior\r\nin almost every battle, weakened them daily.\r\n\r\n6. But the conditions which they proposed were difficult and intricate,\r\nsince they pretended that, out of regard for humanity, their merciful\r\nmonarch was willing to permit the remains of our army to return home,\r\nprovided the Cæsar, with his officers, would satisfy his demands.\r\n\r\n7. In reply, we sent as ambassadors on our part, Arinthæus and\r\nSallustius; and while the proper terms were being discussed with great\r\ndeliberation, we passed four more days in great suffering from want of\r\nprovisions, more painful than any kind of torture.\r\n\r\n8. And in this truce, if before the ambassadors were sent, the emperor,\r\nbeing disabused, had retired slowly from the territories of the enemy,\r\nhe would have reached the forts of Corduena, a rich region belonging to\r\nus, only one hundred miles from the spot where these transactions were\r\nbeing carried on.\r\n\r\n9. But Sapor obstinately demanded (to use his own language) the\r\nrestoration of those territories which had been taken from him by\r\nMaximian; but as was seen in the progress of the negotiation, he in\r\nreality required, as the price of our redemption, five provinces on the\r\nother side of the Tigris,--Arzanena, Moxoena, Zabdicena, Rehemena, and\r\nCorduena, with fifteen fortresses, besides Nisibis, and Singara, and the\r\nimportant fortress called the camp of the Moors.\r\n\r\n10. And though it would have been better to fight ten battles than to\r\ngive up one of them, still a set of flatterers harassed our\r\npusillanimous emperor with harping on the dreaded name of Procopius, and\r\naffirmed that unless we quickly recrossed the river, that chieftain, as\r\nsoon as he heard of the death of Julian, would easily bring about a\r\nrevolution which no one could resist, by means of the fresh troops which\r\nhe had under his command.\r\n\r\n11. Jovian, being wrought upon by the constant reiteration of these\r\nevil counsels, without further delay gave up everything that was\r\ndemanded, with this abatement, which he obtained with difficulty, that\r\nthe inhabitants of Nisibis and Singara should not be given up to the\r\nPersians as well as the cities themselves; and that the Roman garrisons\r\nin the forts about to be surrendered should be permitted to retire to\r\nfortresses of our own.\r\n\r\n12. To which another mischievous and unfair condition was added, that\r\nafter this treaty was concluded we were not to be at liberty to assist\r\nArsaces against the Persians, if he implored our aid, though he had\r\nalways been our friend and trusty ally. And this was insisted on by\r\nSapor for two reasons, in order that the man might be punished who had\r\nlaid waste Chiliocomum at the emperor's command, and also that facility\r\nmight be given for invading Armenia without a check. In consequence of\r\nthis it fell out subsequently that Arsaces was taken prisoner, and that,\r\namid different dissensions and disturbances, the Parthians laid violent\r\nhands on the greater portion of Armenia, where it borders on Media, and\r\non the town of Artaxata.\r\n\r\n13. This ignoble treaty being made, that nothing might be done during\r\nthe armistice, in contravention of its terms, some men of rank were\r\ngiven as hostages on each side: on ours, Remora, Victor, and\r\nBellovædius, tribunes of distinguished legions: and on that of the\r\nenemy, one of their chief nobles named Bineses, and three other satraps\r\nof note.\r\n\r\n14. So peace was made for thirty years, and ratified by solemn oaths;\r\nand we, returning by another line of march, because the parts near the\r\nriver were rugged and difficult, suffered severely for want of water and\r\nprovisions.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. The peace which had been granted on pretence of humanity was turned\r\nto the ruin of many who were so exhausted by want of food as to be at\r\nthe last gasp, and who in consequence could only creep along, and were\r\neither carried away by the current of the river from not being able to\r\nswim, or if able to overcome the force of the stream so far as to reach\r\nthe bank, were either slain like sheep by the Saracens or Persians\r\n(because, as we stated some time back, the Germans had driven them out),\r\nor sent to a distance to be sold for slaves.\r\n\r\n2. But when the trumpets openly gave the signal for crossing the river,\r\nit was dreadful to see with what ardour every individual hastened to\r\nrush into this danger, preferring himself to all his comrades, in the\r\ndesire of avoiding the many dangers and distresses behind him. Some\r\ntried to guide the beasts who were swimming about at random, with\r\nhurdles hurriedly put together; others, seated on bladders, and others,\r\nbeing driven by necessity to all kinds of expedients, sought to pass\r\nthrough the opposing waves by crossing them obliquely.\r\n\r\n3. The emperor himself with a few others crossed over in the small\r\nboats, which we said were saved when the fleet was burnt, and then sent\r\nthe same vessels backwards and forwards till our whole body was brought\r\nacross. And at length all of us, except such as were drowned, reached\r\nthe opposite bank of the river, being saved amid our difficulties by the\r\nfavour of the Supreme Deity.\r\n\r\n4. While we were still oppressed with the fear of impending disasters,\r\nwe learnt from information brought in by our outposts that the Persians\r\nwere throwing a bridge over the river some way off, at a point out of\r\nour sight, in order that while all ideas of war were put an end to on\r\nour side by the ratification of the treaty of peace, they might come\r\nupon our invalids as they proceeded carelessly onwards, and on the\r\nanimals exhausted with fatigue. But when they found their purpose\r\ndiscovered, they relinquished their base design.\r\n\r\n5. Being now relieved from this suspicion, we hastened on by rapid\r\nmarches, and approached Hatra, an ancient town in the middle of a\r\ndesert, which had been long since abandoned, though at different times\r\nthose warlike emperors, Trajan and Severus, had attacked it with a view\r\nto its destruction, but had been almost destroyed with their armies, as\r\nwe have related in our history of their exploits.\r\n\r\n6. And as we now learnt that over the vast plain before us for seventy\r\nmiles in that arid region no water could be found but such as was\r\nbrackish and fetid, and no kind of food but southernwood, wormwood,\r\ndracontium, and other bitter herbs, we filled the vessels which we had\r\nwith sweet water, and having slain the camels and the rest of the beasts\r\nof burden, we thus sought to insure some kind of supplies, though not\r\nvery wholesome.\r\n\r\n7. For six days the army marched, till at last even grass, the last\r\ncomfort of extreme necessity, could not be found; when Cassianus, Duke\r\nof Mesopotamia, and the tribune Mauricius, who had been sent forward\r\nwith this object, came to a fort called Ur, and brought some food from\r\nthe supplies which the army under Procopius and Sebastian, by living\r\nsparingly, had managed to preserve.\r\n\r\n8. From this place another person of the name of Procopius, a secretary,\r\nand Memoridus, a military tribune, was sent forward to Illyricum and\r\nGaul to announce the death of Julian, and the subsequent promotion of\r\nJovian to the rank of emperor.\r\n\r\n9. And Jovian deputed them to present his father-in-law Lucillianus\r\n(who, after giving up military service, had retired to the tranquillity\r\nof private life, and who was at that time dwelling at Sirmium) with a\r\ncommission as captain of the forces of cavalry and infantry, and to urge\r\nhim at the same time to hasten to Milan, to support him there in any\r\ndifficulties which might arise, or (what he feared most) to oppose any\r\nattempts which might be made to bring about a revolution.\r\n\r\n10. And he also gave them still more secret letters, in which he warned\r\nLucillianus to bring him some picked men of tried energy and fidelity,\r\nof whose aid he might avail himself according as affairs should turn\r\nout.\r\n\r\n11. He also made a wise choice, and selected Malarichus, who was at that\r\ntime in Italy on his own private affairs, sending him the ensigns of\r\noffice that he might succeed Jovinus as commander of the forces in Gaul,\r\nin which appointment he had an eye on two important objects; first, to\r\nremove a general of especial merit who was an object of suspicion on\r\nthat very account, and also by the promotion to so high a position of a\r\nman whose hopes were not set on anything so lofty to bind him to exert\r\nall his zeal in supporting the doubtful position of the maker of his\r\nfortunes.\r\n\r\n12. And the officers who went to perform these commands were also\r\nenjoined to extol the emperor's conduct, and wherever they went to agree\r\nin reporting that the Parthian campaign had been brought to an\r\nhonourable termination; they were also charged to prosecute their\r\njourney with all speed by night and day, delivering as they went letters\r\nfrom the new emperor to all the governors of provinces and commanders of\r\nthe forces on their road; and when they had secretly learnt the opinions\r\nof them all, to return to him with all speed, in order that when he knew\r\nwhat was being done in the distant provinces, he might be able to frame\r\nwell-digested and wise plans for strengthening himself in his\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n13. But Fame (being alway the most rapid bearer of bad news),\r\noutstripping these couriers, flew through the different provinces and\r\nnations; and above all others struck the citizens of Nisibis with bitter\r\nsorrow when they heard that their city was surrendered to Sapor, whose\r\nanger and enmity they dreaded, from recollecting the havoc and slaughter\r\nwhich he had made in his frequent attempts to take the place.\r\n\r\n14. For it was clear that the whole eastern empire would have fallen\r\nunder the power of Persia long before if it had not been for the\r\nresistance which this city, strong in its admirable position and its\r\nmighty walls, had been able to offer. But miserable as they now were,\r\nand although they were filled with a still greater fear of what might\r\nbefall them hereafter, they were supported by this slender hope, that,\r\neither from his own inclination or from being won over by their prayers,\r\nthe emperor might consent to keep their city in its existing state, as\r\nthe strongest bulwark of the east.\r\n\r\n15. While different reports were flying about of what had taken place,\r\nthe scanty supplies which I have spoken of as having been brought, were\r\nconsumed, and necessity might have driven the men to eat one another, if\r\nthe flesh of the animals slain had not lasted them a little longer; but\r\nthe consequence of our destitute condition was, that the arms and\r\nbaggage were thrown away; for we were so worn out with this terrible\r\nfamine, that whenever a single bushel of corn was found (which seldom\r\nhappened), it was sold for ten pieces of gold at the least.\r\n\r\n16. Marching on from thence, we come to Thilsaphata where Sebastian and\r\nProcopius, with the tribunes and chief officers of the legions which had\r\nbeen placed under their command for the protection of Mesopotamia, came\r\nto meet the emperor as the solemn occasion required, and being kindly\r\nreceived, accompanied us on our march.\r\n\r\n17. After this, proceeding with all possible speed, we rejoiced when we\r\nsaw Nisibis, where the emperor pitched a standing camp outside the\r\nwalls; and being most earnestly entreated by the whole population to\r\ncome to lodge in the palace according to the custom of his predecessors,\r\nhe positively refused, being ashamed that an impregnable city should be\r\nsurrendered to an enraged enemy while he was within its walls.\r\n\r\n18. But as the evening was getting dark, Jovian, the chief secretary,\r\nwas seized while at supper, the man who at the siege of the city\r\nMaogamalcha we have spoken of as escaping with others by a subterranean\r\npassage, and being led to an out-of-the-way place, was thrown headlong\r\ndown a dry well, and overwhelmed with a heap of stones which were thrown\r\ndown upon him, because after the death of Julian he also had been named\r\nby a few persons as fit to be made emperor; and after the election of\r\nhis namesake had not behaved with any modesty, but had been heard to\r\nutter secret whispers concerning the business, and had from time to time\r\ninvited some of the leading soldiers to entertainments.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\n§ 1. The next day Bineses, one of the Persians of whom we have spoken as\r\nthe most distinguished among them, hastening to execute the commission\r\nof his king, demanded from Jovian the immediate performance of his\r\npromise; and by his permission he entered the city of Nisibis, and\r\nraised the standard of his nation on the citadel, announcing to the\r\ncitizens a miserable emigration from their native place.\r\n\r\n2. Immediately they were all commanded to expatriate themselves, in vain\r\nstretching forth their hands in entreaty not to be compelled to depart,\r\naffirming that they by themselves, without drawing on the public\r\nresources for either provisions or soldiers, were sufficient to defend\r\ntheir own home in full confidence that Justice would be on their side\r\nwhile fighting for the place of their birth, as they had often found her\r\nto be before. Both nobles and common people joined in this supplication;\r\nbut they spoke in vain as to the winds, the emperor fearing the crime of\r\nperjury, as he pretended, though in reality the object of his fear was\r\nvery different.\r\n\r\n3. Then a man of the name of Sabinus, eminent among his fellow-citizens\r\nboth for his fortune and birth, replied with great fluency that\r\nConstantius too was at one time defeated by the Persians in the terrible\r\nstrife of fierce war, that afterwards he fled with a small body of\r\ncomrades to the unguarded station of Hibita, where he lived on a scanty\r\nand uncertain supply of bread which was brought him by an old woman from\r\nthe country; and yet that to the end of his life he lost no territory;\r\nwhile Jovian, at the very beginning of his reign, was yielding up the\r\nwall of his provinces, by the protection of which barrier they had\r\nhitherto remained safe from the earliest ages.\r\n\r\n4. But as he could not prevail on the emperor, who persisted obstinately\r\nin alleging the obligation of his oath, presently, when Jovian, who had\r\nfor some time refused the crown which was offered to him, accepted it\r\nunder a show of compulsion, an advocate, named Silvanus, exclaimed\r\nboldly, \"May you, O emperor, be so crowned in the rest of your cities.\"\r\nBut Jovian was offended at his words, and ordered the whole body of\r\ncitizens to quit the city within three days, in despair as they were at\r\nthe existing state of affairs.\r\n\r\n5. Accordingly, men were appointed to compel obedience to this order,\r\nwith threats of death to every one who delayed his departure; and the\r\nwhole city was a scene of mourning and lamentation, and in every quarter\r\nnothing was heard but one universal wail, matrons tearing their hair\r\nwhen about to be driven from their homes, in which they had been born\r\nand brought up, the mother who had lost her children, or the wife her\r\nhusband, about to be torn from the place rendered sacred by their\r\nshades, clinging to their doorposts, embracing their thresholds, and\r\npouring forth floods of tears.\r\n\r\n6. Every road was crowded, each person straggling away as he could.\r\nMany, too, loaded themselves with as much of their property as they\r\nthought they could carry, while leaving behind them abundant and costly\r\nfurniture, for this they could not remove for want of beasts of burden.\r\n\r\n7. Thou in this place, O fortune of the Roman world, art justly an\r\nobject of accusation, who, while storms were agitating the republic,\r\ndidst strike the helm from the hand of a wise sovereign, to intrust it\r\nto an inexperienced youth, whom, as he was not previously known for any\r\nremarkable actions in his previous life, it is not fair either to blame\r\nor praise.\r\n\r\n8. But it sunk into the heart of all good citizens, that while, out of\r\nfear of a rival claimant of his power, and constantly fancying some one\r\nin Gaul or in Illyricum might have formed ambitious designs, he was\r\nhastening to outstrip the intelligence of his approach, he should have\r\ncommitted, under pretence of reverence for an oath, an act so unworthy\r\nof his imperial power as to abandon Nisibis, which ever since the time\r\nof Mithridates had been the chief hindrance to the encroachments of the\r\nPersians in the East.\r\n\r\n9. For never before since the foundation of Rome, if one consults all\r\nits annals, I believe has any portion of our territories been\r\nsurrendered by emperor or consul to an enemy. Nor is there an instance\r\nof a triumph having been celebrated for the recovery of anything that\r\nhad been lost, but only for the increase of our dominions.\r\n\r\n10. On this principle, a triumph was refused to Publius Scipio for the\r\nrecovery of Spain, to Fulvius for the acquisition of Capua after a long\r\nstruggle, and to Opimius after many battles with various results,\r\nbecause the people of Fregellæ, who at that time were our implacable\r\nenemies, had been compelled to surrender.\r\n\r\n11. For ancient records teach us that disgraceful treaties, made under\r\nthe pressure of extreme necessity, even after the parties to them have\r\nsworn to their observance in set terms, have nevertheless been soon\r\ndissolved by the renewal of war; as in the olden time, after the legions\r\nhad been made to pass under the yoke at the Caudine Forks, in Samnium;\r\nand also when an infamous peace was contemplated by Albinus in Numidia;\r\nand when Mancinus, the author of a peace which was concluded in\r\ndisgraceful haste, was surrendered to the people of Numantia.\r\n\r\n12. Accordingly, when the citizens had been withdrawn, the city\r\nsurrendered, and the tribune Constantius had been sent to deliver up to\r\nthe Persian nobles the fortresses and districts agreed upon, Procopius\r\nwas sent forward with the remains of Julian, to bury them in the suburbs\r\nof Tarsus, according to his directions while alive. He departed, I say,\r\nto fulfil this commission, and as soon as the body was buried, he\r\nquitted Tarsus, and though sought for with great diligence, he could not\r\nbe found anywhere, till long afterwards he was suddenly seen at\r\nConstantinople invested with the purple.\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\n§ 1. These transactions having been thus concluded, after a long march\r\nwe arrived at Antioch, where for several days in succession many\r\nterrible omens were seen, as if the gods were offended, since those who\r\nwere skilled in the interpretation of prodigies foretold that impending\r\nevents would be melancholy.\r\n\r\n2. For the statue of Maximian Cæsar, which was placed in the vestibule\r\nof the palace, suddenly lost the brazen globe, formed after the figure\r\nof the heavens, which it bore in its hand. Also the beams in the council\r\nchamber sounded with an ominous creak; comets were seen in the daytime,\r\nrespecting the nature of which natural philosophers differ.\r\n\r\n3. For some think they have received the name because they scatter fire\r\nwreathed like hair[156] by a number of stars being collected into one\r\nmass; others think that they derive their fire from the dry evaporation\r\nof the earth rising gradually to a greater height; some fancy that the\r\nsunbeams as they rapidly pass, being prevented by dense clouds from\r\ndescending lower, by infusing their brilliancy into a dense body show a\r\nlight which, as it were, seems spotted with stars to the eyes of\r\nmortals. Some again have a fixed opinion that this kind of light is\r\nvisible when some cloud, rising to a greater height than usual, becomes\r\nilluminated by its proximity to the eternal fires; or, that at all\r\nevents there are some stars like the rest, of which the special times of\r\ntheir rising and setting are not understood by man. There are many\r\nother suggestions about comets which have been put forth by men skilled\r\nin mundane philosophy, but I must pass over them, as my subject calls me\r\nin another direction.\r\n\r\n4. The emperor remained a short time at Antioch, distracted by many\r\nimportant cares, but desirous above all things to proceed. And so,\r\nsparing neither man nor beast, he started from that city in the depth of\r\nwinter, though, as I have stated, many omens warned him from such a\r\ncourse, and made his entrance into Tarsus, a noble city of Cilicia, the\r\norigin of which I have already related.\r\n\r\n5. Being in excessive haste to depart from thence, he ordered\r\ndecorations for the tomb of Julian, which was placed in the suburb, in\r\nthe road leading to the defiles of Mount Taurus. Though a sound judgment\r\nwould have decided that the ashes of such a prince ought not to lie\r\nwithin sight of the Cydnus, however beautiful and clear that river is,\r\nbut, to perpetuate the glory of his achievements, ought rather to be\r\nplaced where they might be washed by the Tiber as it passes through the\r\nEternal City and winds round the monuments of the ancient gods.\r\n\r\n6. Then quitting Tarsus, he reached by forced marches Tyana, a town of\r\nCappadocia, where Procopius the secretary and Memoridus the tribune met\r\nhim on their return, and related to him all that occurred; beginning, as\r\nthe order of events required, at the moment when Lucillianus (who had\r\nentered Milan with the tribunes Seniauchus and Valentinian, whom he had\r\nbrought with him, as soon as it was known that Malarichus had refused to\r\naccept the post which was offered to him) hastened on with all speed to\r\nRheims.\r\n\r\n7. There, as if it had been a time of profound tranquillity, he went\r\nquite beside the mark, as we say, and while things were still in a very\r\nunsettled state, he most unseasonably devoted his attention to\r\nscrutinizing the accounts of the commissary, who, being conscious of\r\nfraud and guilt, fled to the standards of the soldiers, and pretended\r\nthat while Julian was still alive some one of the common people had\r\nattempted a revolution. By this false report the army became so greatly\r\nexcited that they put Lucillianus and Seniauchus to death. For\r\nValentinian, who soon afterwards became emperor, had been concealed by\r\nhis host Primitivus in a safe place, overwhelmed with fear and not\r\nknowing which way to flee.\r\n\r\n8. This disastrous intelligence was accompanied by one piece of\r\nfavourable news,--that the soldiers who had been sent by Jovian were\r\napproaching (men known in the camp as the heads of the classes), who\r\nbrought word that the Gallic army had cordially embraced the cause of\r\nJovian.\r\n\r\n9. When this was known, the command of the second class of the Scutarii\r\nwas given to Valentinian, who had returned with those men; and\r\nVitalianus, who had been a soldier of the Heruli, was placed among the\r\nbody-guards, and afterwards, when raised to the rank of count, met with\r\nvery ill success in Illyricum. And at the same time Arinthæus was\r\ndespatched into Gaul with letters for Jovinus, with an injunction to\r\nmaintain his ground and act with resolution and constancy; and he was\r\nfurther charged to make an example of the author of the disturbance\r\nwhich had taken place, and to send the ringleaders of the sedition as\r\nprisoners to the court.\r\n\r\n10. When these matters had been arranged as seemed most expedient, the\r\nGallic soldiers obtained an audience of the emperor at Aspuna, a small\r\ntown of Galatia, and having been admitted into the council chamber,\r\nafter the message which they brought had been listened to with approval,\r\nthey received rewards and were ordered to return to their standards.\r\n\r\nA.D. 364.\r\n\r\n11. When the emperor had made his entry into Ancyra, everything\r\nnecessary for his procession having been prepared as well as the time\r\npermitted, Jovian entered on the consulship, and took as his colleague\r\nhis son Varronianus, who was as yet quite a child, and whose cries as he\r\nobstinately resisted being borne in the curule chair, according to the\r\nancient fashion, was an omen of what shortly happened.\r\n\r\n12. Here also the appointed termination of life carried off Jovian with\r\nrapidity. For when he had reached Dadastana, a place on the borders of\r\nBithynia and Galatia, he was found dead in the night; and many uncertain\r\nreports were spread concerning his death.\r\n\r\n13. It was said that he had been unable to bear the unwholesome smell\r\nof the fresh mortar with which his bedchamber had been plastered. Also\r\nthat his head had swollen in consequence of a great fire of coals, and\r\nthat this had been the cause of his death; others said that he had died\r\nof a surfeit from over eating. He was in the thirty-third year of his\r\nage. And though he and Scipio Æmilianus both died in the same manner, we\r\nhave not found out that any investigation into the death of either ever\r\ntook place.\r\n\r\n14. Jovian was slow in his movements, of a cheerful countenance, with\r\nblue eyes; very tall, so much so that it was long before any of the\r\nroyal robes could be found to fit him. He was anxious to imitate\r\nConstantius, often occupying himself with serious business till after\r\nmidday, and being fond of jesting with his friends in public.\r\n\r\n15. He was given to the study of the Christian law, sometimes doing it\r\nmarked honour; he was tolerably learned in it, very well inclined to its\r\nprofessors, and disposed to promote them to be judges, as was seen in\r\nsome of his appointments. He was fond of eating, addicted to wine and\r\nwomen, though he would perhaps have corrected these propensities from a\r\nsense of what was due to the imperial dignity.\r\n\r\n16. It was said that his father, Varronianus, through the warning of a\r\ndream, had long since foreseen what happened, and had foretold it to two\r\nof his most faithful friends, with the addition that he himself also\r\nshould become consul. But though part of his prophecy became true, he\r\ncould not procure the fulfilment of the rest. For though he heard of his\r\nson's high fortune, he died before he could see him.\r\n\r\n17. And because the old man had it foretold to him in his sleep that the\r\nhighest office was destined for his name, his grandson Varronianus,\r\nwhile still an infant, was made consul with his father Jovian, as we\r\nhave related above.\r\n\r\n\r\n[151] Primicerius: he was the third officer of the guard; the first\r\nbeing the lower; the second, the tribune--answering, as one might say,\r\nto our major.\r\n\r\n[152] The Zianni were an Armenian tribe. The legion belonged to the\r\nThracian establishment.\r\n\r\n[153] Tarquitius was an ancient Etruscan soothsayer, who had written on\r\nthe subject of his art.\r\n\r\n[154] That is Marcus Aurelius.\r\n\r\n[155] It must be remembered that throughout Ammianus's history a count\r\nis always spoken of as of higher rank than a duke.\r\n\r\n[156] From +komê+, hair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK XXVI.\r\n\r\nARGUMENT.\r\n\r\n     I. Valentinian, the tribune of the second school of the Scutarii,\r\n     by the unanimous consent of both the civil and military officers,\r\n     is elected emperor at Nicæa, in his absence--A dissertation on\r\n     leap-year.--II. Valentinian, being summoned from Ancyra, comes with\r\n     speed to Nicæa, and is again unanimously elected emperor, and\r\n     having been clothed in the purple, and saluted as Augustus,\r\n     harangues the army.--III. Concerning the prefecture of Rome, as\r\n     administered by Apronianus.--IV.

The two emperors divide the counts and the\r\n     army between them, and soon afterwards enter on their first\r\n     consulship, the one at Milan, the other at Constantinople--The\r\n     Allemanni lay waste Gaul--Procopius attempts a revolt in the\r\n     East.--VI. The country, family, habits, and rank of Procopius; his\r\n     obscurity in the time of Jovian, and how he came to be saluted\r\n     emperor at Constantinople.--VII.

Nicæa and Chalcedon being delivered\r\n     from their blockades, Bithynia acknowledges the sovereignty of\r\n     Procopius; as presently, after Cyzicus is stormed, the Hellespont\r\n     does likewise.--IX.

Having narrated with exceeding care the series of transactions in\r\nmy own immediate recollection, it is necessary now to quit the track of\r\nnotorious events, in order to avoid the dangers often found in\r\nconnection with truth; and also to avoid exposing ourselves to\r\nunreasonable critics of our work, who would make an outcry as if they\r\nhad been personally injured, if anything should be passed over which the\r\nemperor has said at dinner, if any cause should be overlooked for which\r\nthe common soldiers were assembled round their standards, or if there\r\nwere not inserted a mention of every insignificant fort, however little\r\nsuch things ought to have room in a varied description of different\r\ndistricts. Or if the name of every one who filled the office of urban\r\nprætor be not given, and many other things quite impertinent to the\r\nproper idea of a history, which duly touches on prominent occurrences,\r\nand does not stoop to investigate petty details or secret motives, which\r\nany one who wishes to know may as well hope to be able to count those\r\nlittle indivisible bodies flying through space, which we call atoms.\r\n\r\n2. Some of the ancients, fearing this kind of criticism, though they\r\ncomposed accounts of various actions in a beautiful style, forbore to\r\npublish them, as Tully, a witness of authority, mentions in a letter to\r\nCornelius Nepos. However, let us, despising the ignorance of people in\r\ngeneral, proceed with the remainder of our narrative.\r\n\r\n3. The course of events being terminated so mournfully, by the death of\r\ntwo emperors at such brief intervals, the army, having paid the last\r\nhonours to the dead body which was sent to Constantinople to be interred\r\namong the other emperors, advanced towards Nicæa, which is the\r\nmetropolis of Bithynia, where the chief civil and military authorities\r\napplied themselves to an anxious consideration of the state of affairs,\r\nand as some of them were full of vain hopes, they sought for a ruler of\r\ndignity and proved wisdom.\r\n\r\n4. In reports, and the concealed whispers of a few persons, the name of\r\nEquitius was ventilated, who was at that time tribune of the first class\r\nof the Scutarii; but he was disapproved by the most influential leaders\r\nas being rough and boorish; and their inclinations rather tended towards\r\nJanuarius, a kinsman of Julian, who was the chief commissary of the camp\r\nin Illyricum.\r\n\r\n5. However, he also was rejected because he was at a distance; and, as a\r\nman well qualified and at hand, Valentinian was elected by the unanimous\r\nconsent of all men, and the manifest favour of the Deity. He was the\r\ntribune of the second class of the Scutarii, and had been left at\r\nAncyra, it having been arranged that he should follow afterwards. And,\r\nbecause no one denied that this was for the advantage of the republic,\r\nmessengers were sent to beg him to come with all speed; and for ten\r\ndays the empire was without a ruler, which the soothsayer Marcus, by an\r\ninspection of entrails at Rome, announced to be the case at that moment\r\nin Asia.\r\n\r\n6. But in the meanwhile, to prevent any attempt to overturn what had\r\nbeen thus settled, or any movement on the part of the fickle soldiers to\r\nset aside the election in favour of some one on the spot, Equitius and\r\nLeo, who was acting as commissary under Dagalaiphus the commander of the\r\ncavalry, and who afterwards incurred great odium as master of the\r\noffices,[157] strove with great prudence and vigilance to establish, to\r\nthe best of their power, what had been the decision of the whole army,\r\nthey being also natives of Pannonia, and partisans of the emperor elect.\r\n\r\n7. When Valentinian arrived in answer to the summons he had received,\r\neither in obedience to omens which guided him in the prosecution of the\r\naffair, as was generally thought, or to repeated warnings conveyed in\r\ndreams, he would not come into public or be seen by any one for two\r\ndays, because he wished to avoid the bissextile day of February which\r\ncame at that time, and which he knew to have been often an unfortunate\r\nday for the Roman empire: of this day I will here give a plain\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\n8. The ancients who were skilled in the motions of the world and the\r\nstars, among whom the most eminent are Meton, Euctemon, Hipparchus, and\r\nArchimedes, define it as the period of the revolving year when the sun,\r\nin accordance with the laws which regulate the heavens, having gone\r\nthrough the zodiac, in three hundred and sixty-five days and nights,\r\nreturns to the same point: as, for instance, when, after having moved on\r\nfrom the second degree of the Ram, it returns again to it after having\r\ncompleted its circuit.\r\n\r\n9. But the exact period of a year extends over the number of days above\r\nmentioned and six hours more. And so the correct commencement of the\r\nnext year will not begin till after midday and ends in the evening. The\r\nthird year begins at the first watch, and lasts till the sixth hour of\r\nthe night. The fourth begins at daybreak.\r\n\r\n10. Now as the beginning of each year varies, one commencing at the\r\nsixth hour of the day, another at the same hour of the night, to\r\nprevent the calculation from throwing all science into confusion by its\r\nperplexing diversity, and the months of autumn from sometimes being\r\nfound to come in the spring, it has been settled that those six hours\r\nwhich in a period of four years amount to twenty-four shall be put\r\ntogether so as to make one day and night.\r\n\r\n11. And after much consideration it has been so arranged with the\r\nconcurrence of many learned men, that thus the revolutions of the year\r\nmay come to one regular end, removed from all vagueness and uncertainty,\r\nso that the theory of the heavens may not be clouded by any error, and\r\nthat the months may retain their appointed position.\r\n\r\n12. Before their dominions had reached any wide extent, the Romans were\r\nfor a long time ignorant of this fact, and having been for many years\r\ninvolved in obscure difficulties, they were in deeper darkness and error\r\nthan ever, when they gave the priests the power of intercalating, which\r\nthey, in profligate subservience to the interests of the farmers of the\r\nrevenue, or people engaged in lawsuits, effected by making additions or\r\nsubtractions at their own pleasure.\r\n\r\n13. And from this mode of proceeding many other expedients were adopted,\r\nall of which were fallacious, and which I think it superfluous now to\r\nenumerate. But when they were given up, Octavianus Augustus, in\r\nimitation of the Greeks, corrected these disorderly arrangements and put\r\nan end to these fluctuations, after great deliberation fixing the\r\nduration of the year at twelve months and six hours, during which the\r\nsun with its perpetual movement runs through the whole twelve signs, and\r\nconcludes the period of a whole year.\r\n\r\n14. This rule of the bissextile year, Rome, which is destined to endure\r\nto the end of time, established with the aid of the heavenly Deity. Now\r\nlet us return to our history.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. When this day, so little fit in the opinion of many for beginning\r\nany great affair, had passed, at the approach of evening, by the advice\r\nof the prefect Sallust, an order was issued by general consent, and with\r\nthe penalty of death attached to any neglect of it, that no one of\r\nhigher authority, or suspected of aiming at any objects of ambition,\r\nshould appear in public the next morning.\r\n\r\n2. And when, while the numbers who allowed their own empty wishes to\r\ntorment them were weary of the slowness of time, the night ended at\r\nlast, and daylight appeared, the soldiers were all assembled in one\r\nbody, and Valentinian advanced into the open space, and mounting a\r\ntribunal of some height which had been erected on purpose, he was\r\ndeclared ruler of the empire as a man of due wisdom by this assembly,\r\nbearing the likeness of a comitia, with the unanimous acclamations of\r\nall present.\r\n\r\n3. Presently he was clothed with the imperial robe, and crowned, and\r\nsaluted as Augustus with all the delight which the pleasure of this\r\nnovelty could engender; and then he began to harangue the multitude in a\r\npremeditated speech. But as he put forth his arm to speak more freely, a\r\ngreat murmur arose, the centuries and maniples beginning to raise an\r\nuproar, and the whole mass of the cohorts presently urging that a second\r\nemperor should be at once elected.\r\n\r\n4. And though some people fancied that this cry was raised by a few\r\ncorrupt men in order to gain the favour of those who had been passed\r\nover, it appeared that that was a mistake, for the cry that was raised\r\ndid not resemble a purchased clamour, but rather the unanimous voice of\r\nthe whole multitude all animated with the same wish, because recent\r\nexamples had taught them to fear the instability of this high fortune.\r\nPresently the murmurs of the furious and uproarious army appeared likely\r\nto give rise to a complete tumult, and men began to fear that the\r\naudacity of the soldiers might break out into some atrocious act.\r\n\r\n5. And as Valentinian feared this above everything, he raised his hand\r\nfirmly with the vigour of an emperor full of confidence, and venturing\r\nto rebuke some as obstinate and seditious, he delivered the speech he\r\nhad intended without interruption.\r\n\r\n6. \"I exult, O ye gallant defenders of our provinces, and boast and\r\nalways shall boast that your valour has conferred on me, who neither\r\nexpected nor desired such an honour, the government of the Roman empire,\r\nas the fittest man to discharge its duties. That which was in your\r\nhands before an emperor was elected, you have completed beneficially and\r\ngloriously, by raising to this summit of honour a man whom you know by\r\nexperience to have lived from his earliest youth to his present age with\r\nhonour and integrity. Now then I entreat you to listen with quietness to\r\na few plain observations which I think will be for the public advantage.\r\n\r\n7. \"So numerous are the matters for the consideration of an emperor,\r\nthat I neither deny nor even doubt that it is a desirable thing that he\r\nshould have a colleague of equal power to deal with every contingency.\r\nAnd I myself, as a man, do also fear the great accumulation of cares\r\nwhich must be mine, and the various changes of events. But still we must\r\nuse every exertion to insure concord, by which even the smallest affairs\r\ngive strength. And that is easily secured if, your patience concurring\r\nwith your equity, you willingly grant me what belongs to me in this\r\nmatter. For Fortune, the ally of all good counsels, will I trust aid me,\r\nwhile to the very utmost of my ability and power, I diligently search\r\nfor a wise and temperate partner. For as wise men lay it down, not only\r\nin the case of empire where the dangers are frequent and vast, but also\r\nin matters of private and everyday life, a man ought rather to take a\r\nstranger into his friendship after he has had opportunities of judging\r\nhim to be wise, than to ascertain his wisdom after he has made him his\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n8. \"This, in hopes of a happier fortune, I promise. Do you, retaining\r\nyour steadiness of conduct and loyalty, recruit the vigour of your minds\r\nand bodies while rest in your winter quarters allows you to do so. And\r\nyou shall soon receive what is your due on my nomination as emperor.\"\r\n\r\n9. Having finished this speech, to which his unexpected authority gave\r\nweight, the emperor by it brought all over to his opinion. And even\r\nthose who a few minutes before with loud voices demanded something\r\ndifferent, now, following his advice, surrounded him with the eagles and\r\nstandards, and, forming a splendid and formidable escort of all classes\r\nand ranks of the army, conducted him to the palace.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. While the decisions of Fate were rapidly bringing these events to\r\npass in the East, Apronianus, the governor of Rome, an upright and\r\nsevere judge, among the grave cases by which that prefecture is\r\ncontinually oppressed, was labouring with most particular solicitude to\r\nsuppress the magicians, who were now getting scarce, and who, having\r\nbeen taken prisoners, had been, after being put to the question,\r\nmanifestly convicted by the evidence of their accomplices of having\r\ninjured some persons. These he put to death, hoping thus, by the\r\npunishment of a few, to drive the rest, if any were still concealed, out\r\nof the city through fear of similar treatment.\r\n\r\n2. And he is said to have acted thus energetically because having been\r\npromoted by Julian while he was still in Syria, he had lost one eye on\r\nhis journey to take possession of his office, and he suspected that this\r\nwas owing to his having been the object of some nefarious practices;\r\ntherefore with just but unusual indignation he exerted great industry in\r\nsearching out these and similar crimes. This made him appear cruel to\r\nsome persons, because the populace were continually pouring in crowds\r\ninto the amphitheatre while he was conducting the examination of some of\r\nthe greatest criminals.\r\n\r\n3. At last, after many punishments of this kind had been inflicted, he\r\ncondemned to death the charioteer Hilarinus, who was convicted on his\r\nown confession of having intrusted his son, who was but a very young\r\nboy, to a sorcerer to be taught some secret mysteries forbidden by the\r\nlaws, in order that he might avail himself of unlawful assistance\r\nwithout the privity of any one. But, as the executioner held him but\r\nloosely he suddenly escaped and fled to a Christian altar, and had to be\r\ndragged from it, when he was immediately beheaded.\r\n\r\n4. But soon ample precautions were taken against the recurrence of this\r\nand similar offences, and there were none or very few who ventured\r\nafterwards to insult the rigour of the public law by practising these\r\niniquities. But at a later period long impunity nourished atrocious\r\ncrimes; and licentiousness increased to such a pitch that a certain\r\nsenator followed the example of Hilarinus, and was convicted of having\r\nalmost articled by a regular contract one of his slaves to a teacher of\r\nthe black art, to be instructed in his impious mysteries, though he\r\nescaped punishment by an enormous bribe, as common report went.\r\n\r\n5. And, as it was said, having thus procured an acquittal, though he\r\nought to have been ashamed even to have such an accusation, he took no\r\npains to efface the stain, but as if, among a lot of infamous persons,\r\nhe were the only one absolutely innocent, he used to ride on a\r\nhandsomely caparisoned horse through the streets, and is still always\r\nattended by a troop of slaves, as if by a new and curious fashion he\r\nwere desirous to attract particular observation, just as Duilius in\r\nancient times after his glorious naval victory became so arrogant as to\r\ncause a flute-player to precede him with soft airs when he returned to\r\nhis house after any dinner-party.\r\n\r\n6. Under this same Apronianus all necessaries were so abundant in Rome\r\nthat not the slightest murmur because of any scarcity of supplies was\r\never heard, which is very common at Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n§ 1. But in Bithynia, Valentinian, as we have already mentioned, having\r\nbeen declared emperor, having fixed the next day but one for beginning\r\nhis march, assembled his chief officers, and, as if the course which he\r\npreferred was to follow their advice, inquired whom they recommended him\r\nto take for his colleague; and when no one made him any answer,\r\nDagalaiphus, who at that time was commander of the cavalry, boldly\r\nanswered \"If, O excellent emperor, you love your own kindred, you have a\r\nbrother; if you love the republic, then seek the fittest man to invest.\"\r\n\r\n2. Valentinian was offended with this speech, but kept silence, and\r\ndissembled his displeasure and his intentions. And having made a rapid\r\njourney he reached Nicomedia on the first of March, where he appointed\r\nhis brother Valens master of the horse with the rank of tribune.\r\n\r\n3. And after that, when he reached Constantinople, revolving many\r\nconsiderations in his mind, and considering that he himself was already\r\noverwhelmed with the magnitude of pressing business, he thought that\r\nthe emergency would admit of no delay; and on the 28th of March he led\r\nValens into the suburbs, where, with the consent of all men (and indeed\r\nno one dared to object), he declared him emperor, had him clothed in the\r\nimperial robes, and crowned with a diadem, and then brought him back in\r\nthe same carriage with himself as the legitimate partner of his power,\r\nthough in fact he was to be more like an obedient servant, as the\r\nremainder of my narrative will show.\r\n\r\n4. After these matters had been thus settled without any interruption,\r\nthe two emperors suffered a long time from a violent fever; but when out\r\nof danger (as they were more active in the investigation of evils than\r\nin removing them) they intrusted the commission to investigate the\r\nsecret causes of this malady to Ursatius the master of the offices, a\r\nfierce Dalmatian, and to Juventius Siscianus the quæstor, their real\r\nmotive, as was constantly reported, being to bring the memory of Julian\r\nand that of his friends into odium, as if their illness had been owing\r\nto their secret malpractices. But this insinuation was easily disposed\r\nof, since not a word could be adduced to justify any imputation of such\r\ntreason.\r\n\r\n5. At this time the trumpet as it were gave signal for war throughout\r\nthe whole Roman world; and the barbarian tribes on our frontier were\r\nmoved to make incursion on those territories which lay nearest to them.\r\nThe Allemanni laid waste Gaul and Rhætia at the same time. The\r\nSarmatians and Quadi ravaged Pannonia. The Picts, Scots, Saxons, and\r\nAtacotti harassed the Britons with incessant invasions; the Austoriani\r\nand other Moorish tribes attacked Africa with more than usual violence.\r\nPredatory bands of the Goths plundered Thrace.\r\n\r\n6. The king of the Persians poured troops into Armenia, exerting all his\r\npower to reduce that people again into subjection to his authority;\r\nwithout any just cause, arguing, that after the death of Julian, with\r\nwhom he had made a treaty of peace, there was nothing that ought to\r\nhinder him from recovering those lands which he could prove to have\r\nbelonged in former times to his ancestors.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nA.D. 365.\r\n\r\n§ 1. So after the winter had passed off quietly, the two emperors in\r\nperfect harmony, one having been formally elected, and the other having\r\nbeen admitted to share that honour, though chiefly in appearance, having\r\ntraversed Thrace, arrived at Nissa, where in the suburb which is known\r\nas Mediana, and is three miles from the city, they divided the counts\r\nbetween them as if they were going to separate.\r\n\r\n2. To the share of Valentinian, by whose will everything was settled,\r\nthere fell Jovinus, who had lately been promoted by Julian to be the\r\ncommander of the forces in Gaul, and Dagalaiphus, on whom Jovian had\r\nconferred a similar rank; while Victor was appointed to follow Valens to\r\nthe east: and he also had originally been promoted by the decision of\r\nJulian; and to him was given Ariathæus as a colleague. For Lupicinus,\r\nwho in like manner had sometime before been appointed by Jovian to\r\ncommand the cavalry, was defending the eastern districts.\r\n\r\n3. At the same time Equitius received the command of the army of\r\nIllyricum, with the rank not of general but of count; and Serenianus,\r\nwho sometime before had retired from the service, now, being a citizen\r\nof Pannonia, returned to it, and joined Valens as commander of the\r\ncohort of his guards. This was the way in which these affairs were\r\nsettled, and in which the troops were divided.\r\n\r\n4. After this, when the two brothers entered Sirmium, they divided their\r\ncourts also, and Valentinian as the chief took Milan, while Valens\r\nretired to Constantinople.\r\n\r\n5. Sallust, with the authority of prefect, governed the East, Mamertinus\r\nItaly with Africa and Illyricum, and Germanianus the provinces of Gaul.\r\n\r\n6. It was in the cities of Milan and Constantinople that the emperors\r\nfirst assumed the consular robes. But the whole year was one of heavy\r\ndisaster to the Roman state.\r\n\r\n7. For the Allemanni burst through the limits of Germany, and the cause\r\nof their unusual ferocity was this. They had sent ambassadors to the\r\ncourt, and according to custom they were entitled to regular fixed\r\npresents, but received gifts of inferior value; which, in great\r\nindignation, they threw away as utterly beneath them. For this they were\r\nroughly treated by Ursatius, a man of a passionate and cruel temper, who\r\nat that time was master of the offices; and when they returned and\r\nrelated, with considerable exaggeration, how they had been treated, they\r\nroused the anger of their savage countrymen as if they had been despised\r\nand insulted in their persons.\r\n\r\n8. About the same time, or not much later, Procopius attempted a\r\nrevolution in the east; and both these occurrences were announced to\r\nValentinian on the same day, the 1st of November, as he was on the point\r\nof making his entry into Paris.\r\n\r\n9. He instantly sent Dagalaiphus to make head against the Allemanni,\r\nwho, when they had laid waste the land nearest to them, had departed to\r\na distance without bloodshed. But with respect to the measures necessary\r\nto crush the attempt of Procopius before it gained any strength, he was\r\ngreatly perplexed, being made especially anxious by his ignorance\r\nwhether Valens were alive or dead, that Procopius thus attempted to make\r\nhimself master of the empire.\r\n\r\n10. For Equitius, as soon as he heard the account of the tribune\r\nAntonius, who was in command of the army in the interior of Dacia,\r\nbefore he was able to ascertain the real truth of everything, brought\r\nthe emperor a plain statement of what had taken place.\r\n\r\n11. On this Valentinian promoted Equitius to the command of a division,\r\nand resolved on retiring to Illyricum to prevent a rebel who was already\r\nformidable from overrunning Thrace and then carrying an hostile invasion\r\ninto Pannonia. For he was greatly terrified by recollecting recent\r\nevents, considering how, not long before, Julian, despising an emperor\r\nwho had been invariably successful in every civil war, before he was\r\nexpected or looked for, passed on from city to city with incredible\r\nrapidity.\r\n\r\n12. But his eager desire to return was cooled by the advice of those\r\nabout him, who counselled and implored him not to expose Gaul to the\r\nbarbarians, who were threatening it; nor to abandon on such a pretence\r\nprovinces which were in need of great support. And then prayers were\r\nseconded by embassies from several important cities which entreated him\r\nnot in a doubtful and disastrous crisis to leave them wholly undefended,\r\nwhen by his presence he might at once deliver them from the greatest\r\ndangers, by the mere terror which his mighty name would strike into the\r\nGermans.\r\n\r\n13. At last, having given much deliberation to what might be most\r\nadvisable, he adopted the opinion of the majority, and replied that\r\nProcopius was the foe only of himself and his brother, but the Allemanni\r\nwere the enemies of the whole Roman world; and so he determined in the\r\nmean time not to move beyond the frontier of Gaul.\r\n\r\n14. And advancing to Rheims, being also anxious that Africa should not\r\nbe suddenly invaded, he appointed Neotherius, who at that time was only\r\na secretary, but who afterwards became a consul, to go to the protection\r\nof that country; and with him Masaucio, an officer of the domestic\r\nguard, being induced to add him by the consideration that he was well\r\nacquainted with the disturbed parts, since he had been brought up there\r\nunder his father Cretion, who was formerly Count of Africa; he added\r\nfurther, Gaudentius, a commander of the Scutarii, a man whom he had long\r\nknown, and on whose fidelity he placed entire confidence.\r\n\r\n15. Because therefore these sad disturbances arose on both sides at one\r\nand the same time, we will here arrange our account of each separately\r\nin suitable order; relating first what took place in the East, and\r\nafterwards the war with the barbarians; since the chief events both in\r\nthe West and the East occurred in the same months; lest, by any other\r\nplan, if we skipped over in haste from place to place, we should present\r\nonly a confused account of everything, and so involve our whole\r\nnarrative in perplexity and disorder.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n§ 1. Procopius was born and bred in Cilicia, of a noble family, and\r\noccupied an advantageous position from his youth, as being a relation of\r\nJulian who afterwards became emperor. He was very strict in his way of\r\nlife and morals, reserved and silent; but both as secretary, and\r\nafterwards as tribune distinguishing himself by his services in war,\r\nand rising gradually to the highest rank. After the death of\r\nConstantius, in the changes that ensued, he, being a kinsman of the\r\nemperor, began to entertain higher aims, especially after he was\r\nadmitted to the order of counts; and it became evident that if ever he\r\nwere sufficiently powerful, he would be a disturber of the public peace.\r\n\r\n2. When Julian invaded Persia he left him in Mesopotamia, in command of\r\na strong division of troops, giving him Sebastian for his colleague with\r\nequal power; and he was enjoined (as an uncertain rumour whispered, for\r\nno certain authority for the statement could be produced) to be guided\r\nby the course of events, and if he should find the republic in a languid\r\nstate, and in need of further aid, to cause himself without delay to be\r\nsaluted as emperor.\r\n\r\n3. Procopius executed his commission in a courteous and prudent manner;\r\nand soon afterwards heard of the mortal wound and death of Julian, and\r\nof the elevation of Jovian to the supreme authority; while at the same\r\ntime an ungrounded report had got abroad that Julian with his last\r\nbreath had declared that it was his will that the helm of the state\r\nshould be intrusted to Procopius. He therefore, fearing that in\r\nconsequence of this report he might be put to death uncondemned,\r\nwithdrew from public observation; being especially alarmed after the\r\nexecution of Jovian, the principal secretary, who, as he heard, had been\r\ncruelly put to death with torture, because after the death of Julian he\r\nhad been named by a few soldiers as one worthy to succeed to the\r\nsovereignty, and on that account was suspected of meditating a\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\n4. And because he was aware that he was sought for with great care, he\r\nwithdrew into a most remote and secret district, seeking to avoid giving\r\noffence to any one. Then, finding that his hiding-place was still sought\r\nout by Jovian with increased diligence, he grew weary of living like a\r\nwild beast (since he was not only driven from high rank to a low\r\nstation, but was often in distress even for food, and deprived of all\r\nhuman society); so at last, under the pressure of extreme necessity, he\r\nreturned by secret roads into the district of Chalcedon.\r\n\r\n5. Where, since that appeared a safer retreat, he concealed himself in\r\nthe house of a trusty friend, a man of the name of Strategius, who from\r\nbeing an officer about the palace had risen to be a senator; crossing\r\nover at times to Constantinople whenever he could do so without being\r\nperceived; as was subsequently learnt from the evidence of this same\r\nStrategius after repeated investigations had been made into the conduct\r\nof all who were accomplices in his enterprise.\r\n\r\n6. Accordingly, like a skilful scout, since hardship and want had so\r\naltered his countenance that no one knew him, he collected the reports\r\nthat were flying about, spread by many who, as the present is always\r\ngrievous, accused Valens of being inflamed with a passion for seizing\r\nwhat belonged to others.\r\n\r\n7. An additional stimulus to his ferocity was the emperor's\r\nfather-in-law, Petronius, who, from the command of the Martensian\r\ncohort, had been suddenly promoted to be a patrician. He was a man\r\ndeformed both in mind and appearance, and cruelly eager to plunder every\r\nperson without distinction; torturing all, guilty and innocent, and then\r\nbinding them with fourfold bonds; exacting debts due as far back as the\r\ntime of the emperor Aurelian, and grieving if any one escaped without\r\nloss.\r\n\r\n8. And his natural cruelty was inflamed by this additional incentive,\r\nthat as he was enriched by the sufferings of others, he was inexorable,\r\ncruel, hard hearted, and unfeeling, incapable either of doing justice or\r\nof listening to reason. He was more hated than even Cleander, who, as we\r\nread, while prefect in the time of Commodus, oppressed people of all\r\nranks with his foolish arrogance; and more tyrannical than Plautian, who\r\nwas prefect under Severus, and who with more than mortal pride would\r\nhave thrown everything into confusion, if he had not been murdered out\r\nof revenge.\r\n\r\n9. The cruelties which in the time of Valens, who acted under the\r\ninfluence of Petronius, closed many houses both of poor men and nobles,\r\nand the fear of still worse impending, sank deep into the hearts of both\r\nthe provincials and soldiers, who groaned under the same burdens; and\r\nthough the prayers breathed were silent and secret, yet some change of\r\nthe existing state of things by the interposition of the supreme Deity\r\nwas unanimously prayed for.\r\n\r\n10. This state of affairs came home to the knowledge of Procopius, and\r\nhe, thinking that if Fate were at all propitious, he might easily rise\r\nto the highest power, lay in wait like a wild beast which prepares to\r\nmake its spring the moment it sees anything to seize.\r\n\r\n11. And while he was eagerly maturing his plans, the following chance\r\ngave him an opportunity which proved most seasonable. After the winter\r\nwas past, Valens hastened into Syria; and when he had reached the\r\nborders of Bithynia he learnt from the accounts of the generals that the\r\nnation of the Goths, who up to that time had never come into collision\r\nwith us, and who were therefore very fierce and untractable, were all\r\nwith one consent preparing for an invasion of our Thracian frontier.\r\nWhen he heard this, in order to proceed on his own journey without\r\nhindrance, he ordered a sufficient force of cavalry and infantry to be\r\nsent into the districts in which the inroads of these barbarians were\r\napprehended.\r\n\r\n12. Therefore, as the emperor was now at a distance, Procopius, being\r\nwearied by his protracted sufferings, and thinking even a cruel death\r\npreferable to a longer endurance of them, precipitately plunged into\r\ndanger; and not fearing the last extremities, but being wrought up\r\nalmost to madness, he undertook a most audacious enterprise. His desire\r\nwas to win over the legions known as the Divitenses and the younger\r\nTungricani, who were under orders to march through Thrace for the coming\r\ncampaign, and, according to custom, would stop two days at\r\nConstantinople on their way; and for this object he intended to employ\r\nsome of them whom he knew, thinking it safer to rely on the fidelity of\r\na few, and dangerous and difficult to harangue the whole body.\r\n\r\n13. Those whom he selected as emissaries, being secured by the hope of\r\ngreat rewards, promised with a solemn oath to do everything he desired;\r\nand undertook also for the good-will of their comrades, among whom they\r\nhad great influence from their long and distinguished service.\r\n\r\n14. As was settled between them, when day broke, Procopius, agitated by\r\nall kinds of thoughts and plans, repaired to the Baths of Anastasia, so\r\ncalled from the sister of Constantine, where he knew these legions were\r\nstationed; and being assured by his emissaries that in an assembly which\r\nhad been held during the preceding night all the men had declared their\r\nadherence to his party, he received from them a promise of safety, and\r\nwas gladly admitted to their assembly; where, however, though treated\r\nwith all honour by the throng of mercenary soldiers, he found himself\r\ndetained almost as a hostage; for they, like the prætorians who after\r\nthe death of Pertinax had accepted Julian as their emperor because he\r\nbid highest, now undertook the cause of Procopius in the hope of great\r\ngain to themselves from the unlucky reign he was planning.\r\n\r\n15. Procopius therefore stood among them, looking pale and ghost-like;\r\nand as a proper royal robe could not be found, he wore a tunic spangled\r\nwith gold, like that of an officer of the palace, and the lower part of\r\nhis dress like that of a boy at school; and purple shoes; he also bore a\r\nspear, and carried a small piece of purple cloth in his right hand, so\r\nthat one might fancy that some theatrical figure or dramatic\r\npersonification had suddenly come upon the stage.\r\n\r\n16. Being thus ridiculously put forward as if in mockery of all honours,\r\nhe addressed the authors of his elevation with servile flattery,\r\npromising them vast riches and high rank as the first-fruits of his\r\npromotion; and then he advanced into the streets, escorted by a\r\nmultitude of armed men; and with raised standards he prepared to\r\nproceed, surrounded by a horrid din of shields clashing with a mournful\r\nclang, as the soldiers, fearing lest they might be injured by stones or\r\ntiles from the housetops, joined them together above their heads in\r\nclose order.\r\n\r\n17. As he thus advanced boldly the people showed him neither aversion\r\nnor favour; but he was encouraged by the love of sudden novelty, which\r\nis implanted in the minds of most of the common people, and was further\r\nexcited by the knowledge that all men unanimously detested Petronius,\r\nwho, as I have said before, was accumulating riches by all kinds of\r\nviolence, reviving actions that had long been buried, and oppressing all\r\nranks with the exaction of forgotten debts.\r\n\r\n18. Therefore when Procopius ascended the tribunal, and when, as all\r\nseemed thunderstruck and bewildered, even the gloomy silence was\r\nterrible, thinking (or, indeed, expecting) that he had only found a\r\nshorter way to death, trembling so as to be unable to speak, he stood\r\nfor some time in silence. Presently when he began, with a broken and\r\nlanguid voice, to say a few words, in which he spoke of his relationship\r\nto the imperial family, he was met at first with but a faint murmur of\r\napplause from those whom he had bribed; but presently he was hailed by\r\nthe tumultuous clamours of the populace in general as emperor, and\r\nhurried off to the senate-house, where he found none of the nobles, but\r\nonly a small number of the rabble of the city; and so he went on with\r\nspeed, but in an ignoble style, to the palace.\r\n\r\n19. One might marvel that this ridiculous beginning, so improvidently\r\nand rashly engaged in, should have led to melancholy disasters for the\r\nrepublic, if one were ignorant of previous history, and imagined that\r\nthis was the first time any such thing had happened. But, in truth, it\r\nwas in a similar manner that Andriscus of Adramyttium, a man of the very\r\nlowest class, assuming the name of Philip, added a third calamitous war\r\nto the previous Macedonian wars. Again, while the emperor Macrinus was\r\nat Antioch, it was then that Antoninus Heliogabalus issued forth from\r\nEmessa. Thus also Alexander, and his mother Mamæa, were put to death by\r\nthe unexpected enterprise of Maximinus. And in Africa the elder Gordian\r\nwas raised to the imperial authority, till, being overwhelmed with agony\r\nat the dangers which threatened him, he put an end to his life by\r\nhanging himself.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. So the dealers in cheap luxuries, and those who were about the\r\npalace, or who had ceased to serve, and all who, having been in the\r\nranks of the army, had retired to a more tranquil life, now embarked in\r\nthis unusual and doubtful enterprise, some against their will, and\r\nothers willingly. Some, however, thinking anything better than the\r\npresent state of affairs, escaped secretly from the city, and hastened\r\nwith all speed to the emperor's camp.\r\n\r\n2. They were all outstripped by the amazing celerity of Sophronius, at\r\nthat time a secretary, afterwards prefect of Constantinople, who reached\r\nValens as he was just about to set out from Cæsarea in Cappadocia, in\r\norder, now that the hot weather of Cilicia was over, to go to Antioch;\r\nand having related to him all that had taken place, brought him, though\r\nwholly amazed and bewildered at so doubtful and perplexing a crisis,\r\nback into Galatia to encounter the danger before it had risen to a head.\r\n\r\n3. While Valens was pushing forward with all speed, Procopius was using\r\nall his energy day and night, producing different persons who with\r\ncunning boldness pretended that they had arrived, some from the east,\r\nsome from Gaul, and who reported that Valentinian was dead, and that\r\neverything was easy for the new and favoured emperor.\r\n\r\n4. And because enterprises suddenly and wantonly attempted are often\r\nstrengthened by promptness of action, and in order to neglect nothing,\r\nNebridius, who had been recently promoted through the influence of\r\nPetronius to be prefect of the prætorium in the place of Sallust, and\r\nCæsarius, the prefect of Constantinople, were at once thrown into\r\nprison; and Phronemius was intrusted with the government of the city,\r\nwith the customary powers; and Euphrasius was made master of the\r\noffices, both being Gauls, and men of known accomplishments and good\r\ncharacter. The government of the camp was intrusted to Gomoarius and\r\nAgilo, who were recalled to military service with that object--a very\r\nill-judged appointment, as was seen by the result.\r\n\r\n5. Now because Count Julius, who was commanding the forces in Thrace,\r\nwas feared as likely to employ the troops at the nearest stations to\r\ncrush the rebels if he received information of what was being done, a\r\nvigorous measure was adopted; and he was summoned to Constantinople by\r\nletter, which Nebridius, while still in prison, was compelled to write,\r\nas if he had been appointed by Valens to conduct some serious measures\r\nin connection with the movements of the barbarians; and as soon as he\r\narrived he was seized and kept in close custody. By this cunning\r\nartifice the warlike tribes of Thrace were brought over without\r\nbloodshed, and proved a great assistance to this disorderly enterprise.\r\n\r\n6. After this success, Araxius, by a court intrigue, was made prefect of\r\nthe prætorium, as if at the recommendation of Agilo, his son-in-law.\r\nMany others were admitted to various posts in the palace, and to the\r\ngovernment of provinces; some against their will, others voluntarily,\r\nand even giving bribes for their promotion.\r\n\r\n7. And, as often happens in times of intestine commotion, some men, from\r\nthe very dregs of the populace, rose to a high position, led by\r\ndesperate boldness and insane expectations; while, on the contrary,\r\nothers of noble birth fell from the highest elevation down to exile and\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n8. When by these and similar acts the party of Procopius seemed firmly\r\nestablished, the next thing was to assemble a sufficient military force;\r\nand that was easily managed, though sometimes, in times of public\r\ndisorder, a failure here has hindered great enterprises, and even some\r\nwhich had a lawful origin.\r\n\r\n9. The divisions of cavalry and infantry which were passing through\r\nThrace were easily gained over, and being kindly and liberally treated,\r\nwere collected into one body, and at once presented the appearance of an\r\narmy; and being excited by magnificent promises, they swore with solemn\r\noaths fidelity to Procopius, promising to defend him with unswerving\r\nloyalty.\r\n\r\n10. For a most seasonable opportunity of gaining them over was found;\r\nbecause he carried in his arms the little daughter of Constantius, whose\r\nmemory was still held in reverence, himself also claiming relationship\r\nwith Julian. He also availed himself of another seasonable incident,\r\nnamely, that it was while Faustina, the mother of the child, was present\r\nthat he had received the insignia of the imperial rites.\r\n\r\n11. He employed also another expedient (though it required great\r\npromptitude); he chose some persons, as stupid as they were rash, whom\r\nhe sent to Illyricum, relying on no support except their own impudence;\r\nbut also well furnished with pieces of gold stamped with the head of the\r\nnew emperor, and with other means suited to win over the multitude. But\r\nthese men were arrested by Equitius, who was the commander of the forces\r\nin that country, and were put to death by various methods.\r\n\r\n12. And then, fearing similar attempts by Procopius, he blocked up the\r\nthree narrowest entrances into the northern province; one through Dacia,\r\nalong the course of the different rivers; another, and that the most\r\nfrequented, through the Succi; and the third through Macedonia, which is\r\nknown as the Acontisma. And in consequence of these precautions the\r\nusurper was deprived of all hope of becoming master of Illyricum, and\r\nlost one great resource for carrying on the war.\r\n\r\n13. In the mean time Valens, overwhelmed with the strange nature of this\r\nintelligence, and being already on his return through Gallo-Græcia,\r\nafter he had heard what had happened at Constantinople, advanced with\r\ngreat diffidence and alarm; and as his sudden fears deprived him of his\r\nusual prudence, he fell into such despondency that he thought of laying\r\naside his imperial robes as too heavy a burden; and in truth he would\r\nhave done so if those about him had not hindered him from adopting so\r\ndishonourable a resolution. So, being encouraged by the opinions of\r\nbraver men, he ordered two legions, known as the Jovian and the\r\nVictorian, to advance in front to storm the rebel camp.\r\n\r\n14. And when they approached, Procopius, who had returned from Nicæa, to\r\nwhich city he had lately gone with the legion of Divitenses and a\r\npromiscuous body of deserters, which he had collected in a few days,\r\nhastened to Mygdus on the Sangarius.\r\n\r\n15. And when the legions, being now prepared for battle, assembled\r\nthere, and while both sides were exchanging missiles as if wishing to\r\nprovoke an attack, Procopius advanced by himself into the middle, and\r\nunder the guidance of favourable fortune, he remarked in the opposite\r\nranks a man named Vitalianus (it is uncertain whether he had known him\r\nbefore), and having given him his hand and embraced him, he said, while\r\nboth armies were equally astonished.\r\n\r\n16. \"And is this the end of the ancient fidelity of the Roman armies,\r\nand of the oaths taken under the strictest obligations of religion! Have\r\nyou decided, O gallant men, to use your swords in defence of strangers,\r\nand that a degenerate Pannonian should undermine and upset everything,\r\nand so enjoy a sovereign power which he never even ventured to picture\r\nto himself in his prayers, while we lament over your ill-fortune and our\r\nown. Follow rather the race of your own noble princes which is now in\r\narms, not with the view of seizing what does not belong to it, but with\r\nthe hope of recovering its ancestral possessions and hereditary\r\ndignities.\"\r\n\r\n17. All were propitiated by this conciliatory speech, and those who had\r\ncome with the intention of fighting now readily lowered their standards\r\nand eagles, and of their own accord came over to him; instead of\r\nuttering their fearful yells, they unanimously saluted Procopius\r\nemperor, and escorted him to his camp, calling Jupiter to witness, after\r\ntheir military fashion, that Procopius should prove invincible.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. Another fortunate circumstance occurred to swell the prosperity of\r\nthe rebels. A tribune named Rumitalca, who had joined the partisans of\r\nProcopius, having been intrusted with the guard of the palace, digested\r\na plan, and after mingling with the soldiers, passed over by sea to the\r\ntown formerly known as Drepanum, but now as Helenopolis, and thence\r\nmarched upon Nicæa, and made himself master of it before any one dreamt\r\nof such a step.\r\n\r\n2. Valens sent Vadomarius, who had formerly been duke and king of the\r\nAllemanni, with a body of troops experienced in that kind of work, to\r\nbesiege Nicæa, and proceeded himself to Nicomedia; and passing on from\r\nthat city, he pressed the siege of Chalcedon with all his might; but the\r\ncitizens poured reproaches on him from the walls, calling him\r\nSabaiarius, or beer-drinker. Now Sabai is a drink made of barley or\r\nother grain, and is used only by poor people in Illyricum.\r\n\r\n3. At last, being worn out by the scarcity of supplies and the exceeding\r\nobstinacy of the garrison, he was preparing to raise the siege, when the\r\ngarrison who were shut up in Nicæa suddenly opened the gates and issued\r\nforth, destroying a great portion of the works of the besiegers, and\r\nunder the command of the faithful Rumitalca hastened on eagerly in the\r\nhope of cutting off Valens, who had not yet quitted the suburb of\r\nChalcedon. And they would have succeeded in their attempt if he had not\r\nlearnt the imminence of his danger from some rumour, and eluded the\r\nenemy who were pressing on his track, by departing with all speed by a\r\nroad lying between the lake Sunon and the winding course of the river\r\nGallus. And through this circumstance Bithynia also fell into the hands\r\nof Procopius.\r\n\r\n4. When Valens had returned by forced marches from this city to Ancyra,\r\nand had learnt that Lupicinus was approaching with no inconsiderable\r\nforce from the East, he began to entertain better hopes, and sent\r\nArinthæus as his most approved general to encounter the enemy.\r\n\r\n5. And when Arinthæus reached Dadastana, where we have mentioned that\r\nJovian died, he suddenly saw in his front, Hyperechius, who had\r\npreviously been only a subaltern, but who now, as a trusty friend, had\r\nreceived from Procopius the command of the auxiliary forces. And\r\nthinking it no credit to defeat in battle a man of no renown, relying on\r\nhis authority and on his lofty personal stature, he shouted out a\r\ncommand to the enemy themselves to take and bind their commander; they\r\nobeyed, and so this mere shadow of a general was arrested by the hands\r\nof his own men.\r\n\r\n6. In the interim, a man of the name of Venustus, who had been an\r\nofficer of the treasury under Valens, and who had some time before been\r\nsent to Nicomedia, to distribute pay to the soldiers who were scattered\r\nover the East, when he heard of this disaster, perceived that the time\r\nwas unfavourable for the execution of his commission, and repaired in\r\nhaste to Cyzicus with the money which he had with him.\r\n\r\n7. There, as it happened, he met Serenianus, who was at that time the\r\ncount of the guards, and who had been sent to protect the treasury, and\r\nwho now, with a garrison collected in a hurry, had undertaken the\r\ndefence of the city, which was impregnable in its walls, and celebrated\r\nalso for many ancient monuments, though Procopius, in order, now that he\r\nhad got possession of Bithynia, to make himself master of the\r\nHellespont, had sent a strong force to besiege it.\r\n\r\n8. The siege went on slowly; often numbers of the besiegers were wounded\r\nby arrows and bullets, and other missiles; and by the skill of the\r\ngarrison a barrier of the strongest iron chain was thrown across the\r\nmouth of the harbour, fastened strongly to the land on each side, to\r\nprevent the ships of the enemy, which were armed with beaks, from\r\nforcing their way in.\r\n\r\n9. This boom, however, after great exertions on the part of both\r\nsoldiers and generals, who were all exhausted by the fierce nature of\r\nthe struggle, a tribune of the name of Aliso, an experienced and skilful\r\nwarrior, cut through in the following manner:--He fastened together\r\nthree vessels, and placed upon them a kind of testudo, thus,--on the\r\nbenches stood a body of armed men, united together by their shields,\r\nwhich joined above their heads; behind them was another row, who\r\nstooped, so as to be lower; a third rank bent lower still, so as to form\r\na regular gradation; so that the last row of all, resting on their\r\nhaunches, gave the whole formation the appearance of an arch. This kind\r\nof machine is employed in contests under the walls of towns, in order\r\nthat while the blows of missiles and stones fall on the slippery descent\r\nthey may pass off like so much rain.\r\n\r\n10. Aliso then, being for a while defended from the shower of missiles,\r\nby his own vast strength held a log under this chain, while with a\r\nmighty blow of his axe he cut it through, so that being driven asunder,\r\nit left the broad entrance open, and thus the city was laid open\r\nunprotected to the assault of the enemy. And on this account, when,\r\nafter the death of the originator of all this confusion, cruel vengeance\r\nwas taken on the members of his party, the same tribune, from a\r\nrecollection of his gallant action, was granted his life and allowed to\r\nretain his commission, and a long time afterwards fell in Isauria in a\r\nconflict with a band of ravagers.\r\n\r\n11. When Cyzicus was thus opened to him, Procopius hastened thither, and\r\npardoned all who had opposed him, except Serenianus, whom he put in\r\nirons, and sent to Nicæa, to be kept in close confinement.\r\n\r\n12. And immediately he appointed the young Hormisdas (the son of the\r\nformer Prince Hormisdas) proconsul intrusting him in the ancient fashion\r\nwith the command both in civil and military affairs. He conducted\r\nhimself, as his natural disposition prompted him, with moderation, but\r\nwas almost seized by the soldiers whom Valens had sent by the difficult\r\npasses of Phrygia; he saved himself, however, by great energy, embarking\r\non board a vessel which he kept in readiness for any emergency,\r\ncarrying off also his wife, who followed him, and was nearly taken\r\nprisoner, had he not protected her under a shower of arrows. She was a\r\nlady of high family and great wealth, whose modesty and the glorious\r\ndestiny reserved for her subsequently saved her husband from great\r\ndangers.\r\n\r\n13. In consequence of this victory Procopius was elated beyond measure,\r\nand not knowing that a man, however happy, if Fortune turns her wheel\r\nmay become most miserable before evening, he ordered the house of\r\nArbetio, which he had previously spared as that of one of his own\r\npartisans, to be rifled, and it was full of furniture of countless\r\nvalue. The reason of his indignation against Arbetio was, that though he\r\nhad summoned him several times to come to him, he had deferred his\r\naudience, pleading old age and sickness.\r\n\r\n14. And this presumptuous man might, from the uncertainty in human\r\naffairs, have feared some great change; but though without any\r\nresistance he could have overrun the provinces of the East with the\r\nwilling consent of the natives themselves, who, from weariness of the\r\nsevere rule under which they then were, were eager for any change\r\nwhatever, he indolently lingered, hoping to gain over some cities of\r\nAsia Minor, and to collect some men who were skilful in procuring gold,\r\nand who would be of use to him in future battles, which he expected\r\nwould be both numerous and severe.\r\n\r\n15. Thus he was allowing himself to grow blunt, like a rusty sword; just\r\nas formerly Pescennius Niger, when repeatedly urged by the Roman people\r\nto come to their aid at a time of great extremity, lost a great deal of\r\ntime in Syria, and at last was defeated by Severus in the Gulf of Issus\r\n(which is a town in Cilicia, where Alexander conquered Darius), and was\r\nput to death by a common soldier in a suburb of Antioch.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\nA.D. 366.\r\n\r\n§ 1. These events took place in the depth of winter, in the consulship\r\nof Valentinian and Valens. But this high office of consul was\r\ntransferred to Gratian, who was as yet only a private individual, and to\r\nDagalaiphus. And then, having collected his forces at the approach of\r\nspring, Valens, having united Lupicinus's troops, which were a numerous\r\nbody, to his own, marched with all speed towards Pessinus, which was\r\nformerly reckoned a town of Phrygia, but was now considered to belong to\r\nGalatia.\r\n\r\n2. Having speedily secured it with a garrison, to prevent any unforeseen\r\ndanger from arising in that district, he proceeded along the foot of\r\nMount Olympus by very difficult passes to Lycia, intending to attack\r\nGomoarius, who was loitering in that province.\r\n\r\n3. Many vehemently opposed this project from this consideration, that\r\nhis enemy, as has been already mentioned, always bore with him on a\r\nlitter the little daughter of Constantius, with her mother Faustina,\r\nboth when marching and when preparing for battle, thus exciting the\r\nsoldiers to fight more resolutely for the imperial family, with which,\r\nas he told them, he himself was connected. So formerly, when the\r\nMacedonians were on the point of engaging in battle with the Illyrians,\r\nthey placed their king, who was still an infant,[158] in his cradle\r\nbehind the line of battle, and the fear lest he should be taken prisoner\r\nmade them exert themselves the more so as to defeat their enemies.\r\n\r\n4. To counteract this crafty manoeuvre the emperor, in the critical\r\nstate of his affairs, devised a sagacious remedy, and summoned Arbetio,\r\nformerly consul, but who was now living in privacy, to join him, in\r\norder that the fierce minds of the soldiers might be awed by the\r\npresence of a general who had served under Constantine. And it happened\r\nas he expected.\r\n\r\n5. For when that officer, who was older in years than all around him,\r\nand superior in rank, showed his venerable gray hairs to the numbers who\r\nwere inclined to violate their oaths, and accused Procopius as a public\r\nrobber, and addressing the soldiers who followed his guilty leadership\r\nas his own sons and the partners of his former toils, entreated them\r\nrather to follow him as a parent known to them before as a successful\r\nleader than obey a profligate spendthrift who ought to be abandoned, and\r\nwho would soon fall.\r\n\r\n6. And when Gomoarius heard this, though he might have escaped from the\r\nenemy and returned in safety to the place from whence he came, yet,\r\navailing himself of the proximity of the emperor's camp, he passed over\r\nunder the guise of a prisoner, as if he had been surrounded by the\r\nsudden advance of a superior force.\r\n\r\n7. Encouraged by this, Valens quickly moved his camp to Phrygia, and\r\nengaged the enemy near Nacolia, and the battle was doubtful till Agilo,\r\nthe leader of Procopius's forces, betrayed his side by a sudden\r\ndesertion of his ranks; and he was followed by many who, brandishing\r\ntheir javelins and their swords, crossed over to the emperor, bearing\r\ntheir standards and their shields reversed, which is the most manifest\r\nsign of defection.\r\n\r\n8. When this unexpected event took place, Procopius abandoning all hope\r\nof safety, dismounted, and sought a hiding-place on foot in the groves\r\nand hills. He was followed by Florentius and the tribune Barchalbas, who\r\nhaving been known ever since the time of Constantine in all the terrible\r\nwars which had taken place, was now driven into treason by necessity not\r\nby inclination.\r\n\r\n9. So when the greater part of the night was passed, as the moon, which\r\nhad risen in the evening, by continuing her light till dawn increased\r\ntheir fear, Procopius, finding it impossible to escape, and having no\r\nresources, as is often the case in moments of extreme danger, began to\r\nblame his mournful and disastrous fortune. And being overwhelmed with\r\ncare, he was on a sudden taken and bound by his own comrades, and, at\r\ndaybreak led to the camp, and brought, silent and downcast, before the\r\nemperor. He was immediately beheaded; and his death put an end to the\r\nincreasing disturbances of civil war. His fate resembled that of\r\nPerpenna of old, who, after Sertorius had been slain at a banquet,\r\nenjoyed the power for a short time, but was dragged out of the thicket\r\nwhere he was concealed, and brought to Pompey, by whose orders he was\r\nput to death.\r\n\r\n10. Giving way to equal indignation against Florentius and Barchalbas,\r\nthough they delivered up Procopius, he instantly ordered them also to be\r\nslain, without listening to reason. For if they had betrayed their\r\nlegitimate prince, Justice herself would pronounce them justly slain;\r\nbut if he whom they betrayed was a rebel and an enemy to the\r\ntranquillity of the state, as was alleged, then they ought to have\r\nreceived an ample reward for so memorable an action.\r\n\r\n11. Procopius perished at the age of forty years and ten months. He was\r\nof a goodly appearance, tall, inclined to stoop, always looking on the\r\nground as he walked, and in his reserved and melancholy manners like\r\nCrassus, whom Lucillius and Cicero record never to have smiled but once\r\nin his life; and what is very remarkable, as long as he lived he never\r\nshed blood.\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\n§ 1. About the same time, his kinsman Marcellus, an officer of the\r\nguard, who commanded the garrison of Nicæa, hearing of the treachery of\r\nthe soldiers and the death of Procopius, attacked Serenianus, who was\r\nconfined in the palace, unexpectedly at midnight, and put him to death.\r\nAnd his death was the safety of many.\r\n\r\n2. For if he, a man of rude manners, bitter temper, and a love of\r\ninjuring people, had survived Valens's victory, having also great\r\ninfluence with Valens from the similarity of his disposition and the\r\nproximity of their birthplaces, he would have studied the secret\r\ninclinations of a prince always inclined to cruelty, and would have shed\r\nthe blood of many innocent persons.\r\n\r\n3. Having killed him, Marcellus by a rapid march seized on Chalcedon,\r\nand with the aid of a few people, whom the lowness of their condition\r\nand despair urged to crime, obtained a shadow of authority which proved\r\nfatal to him, being deceived by two circumstances, because he thought\r\nthat the three thousand Goths who, after their kings had been\r\nconciliated, had been sent to aid Procopius, who had prevailed on them\r\nto support him by pleading his relationship to Constantine, would at a\r\nsmall cost be easily won over to support him, and also because he was\r\nignorant of what had happened in Illyricum.\r\n\r\n4. While these alarming events were taking place, Equitius, having\r\nlearnt by trustworthy reports from his scouts that the whole stress of\r\nthe war was now to be found in Asia, passed through the Succi, and made\r\na vigorous attempt to take Philippopolis, the ancient Eumolpias,[159]\r\nwhich was occupied by a garrison of the enemy. It was a city in a most\r\nfavourable position, and likely to prove an obstacle to his approach if\r\nleft in his rear, and if he, while conducting reinforcements to Valens\r\n(for he was not yet acquainted with what had happened at Nacolia),\r\nshould be compelled to hasten to the district around Mount Hæmus.\r\n\r\n5. But when, a few days later, he heard of the foolish usurpation of\r\nMarcellus, he sent against him a body of bold and active troops, who\r\nseized him as a mischievous slave, and threw him into prison. From\r\nwhich, some days afterwards, he was brought forth, scourged severely\r\nwith his accomplices, and put to death, having deserved favour by no\r\naction of his life except that he had slain Serenianus, a man as cruel\r\nas Phalaris, and faithful only in barbarity, which he displayed on the\r\nslightest pretext.\r\n\r\n6. The war being now at an end by the death of the leader, many were\r\ntreated with much greater severity than their errors or faults required,\r\nespecially the defenders of Philippopolis, who would not surrender the\r\ncity or themselves till they saw the head of Procopius, which was\r\nconveyed to Gaul.\r\n\r\n7. Some, however, by the influence of intercessors, received mercy, the\r\nmost eminent of whom was Araxius, who, when the crisis was at its\r\nheight, had applied for and obtained the office of prefect. He, by the\r\nintercession of his son-in-law Agilo, was punished only by banishment to\r\nan island, from which he soon afterwards escaped.\r\n\r\n8. But Euphrasius and Phronemius were sent to the west to be at the\r\ndisposal of Valentinian. Euphrasius was acquitted, but Phronemius was\r\ntransported to the Chersonesus, being punished more severely than the\r\nother, though their case was the same, because he had been a favourite\r\nwith the late emperor Julian, whose memorable virtues the two brothers\r\nnow on the throne joined in disparaging, though they were neither like\r\nnor equal to him.\r\n\r\n9. To these severities other grievances of greater importance, and more\r\nto be dreaded than any sufferings in battle, were added. For the\r\nexecutioner, and the rack, and bloody modes of torture, now attacked men\r\nof every rank, class, or fortune, without distinction. Peace seemed as a\r\npretext for establishing a detestable tribunal, while all men cursed\r\nthe ill-omened victory that had been gained as worse than the most\r\ndeadly war.\r\n\r\n10. For amid arms and trumpets the equality of every one's chance makes\r\ndanger seem lighter; and often the might of martial valour obtains what\r\nit aims at; or else a sudden death, if it befalls a man, is attended by\r\nno feeling of ignominy, but brings an end to life and to suffering at\r\nthe same time. When, however, laws and statutes are put forth as\r\npretexts for wicked counsels, and judges, affecting the equity of Cato\r\nor Cassius, sit on the bench, though in fact everything is done at the\r\ndiscretion of over-arrogant power, on the whim of which every man's life\r\nor death depends, the mischief is fatal and incurable.\r\n\r\n11. For at this time any one might go to the palace on any pretext, and\r\nif he were inflamed with a desire of appropriating the goods of others,\r\nthough the person he accused might be notoriously innocent, he was\r\nreceived by the emperor as a friend to be trusted and deserving to be\r\nenriched at the expense of others.\r\n\r\n12. For the emperor was quick to inflict injury, always ready to listen\r\nto informers, admitting the most deadly accusations, and exulting\r\nunrestrainedly in the diversity of punishments devised; ignorant of the\r\nexpression of Tully, which teaches us that those men are unhappy who\r\nthink themselves privileged to do everything.\r\n\r\n13. This implacability, unworthy of a just cause, and disgracing his\r\nvictory, exposed many innocent men to the torturers, crushing them\r\nbeneath the rack, or slaying them by the stroke of the fierce\r\nexecutioner. Men who, if nature had permitted, would rather have lost\r\nten lives in battle than be thus tortured while guiltless of all crime,\r\nhaving their estates confiscated, as if guilty of treason, and their\r\nbodies mutilated before death, which is the most bitter kind of death.\r\n\r\n14. At last, when his ferocity was exhausted by his cruelties, men of\r\nthe highest rank were still exposed to proscription, banishment, and\r\nother punishments which, though severe, appear lighter to some people.\r\nAnd in order to enrich some one else, men of noble birth, and perhaps\r\nstill more richly endowed with virtues, were stripped of their patrimony\r\nand driven into exile, where they were exhausted with misery, perhaps\r\nbeing even reduced to subsist by beggary. Nor was any limit put to the\r\ncruelties which were inflicted till both the prince and those about him\r\nwere satiated with plunder and bloodshed.\r\n\r\n15. While the usurper, whose various acts and death we have been\r\nrelating, was still alive, on the 21st of July, in the first consulship\r\nof Valentinian and his brother, fearful dangers suddenly overspread the\r\nwhole world, such as are related in no ancient fables or histories.\r\n\r\n16. For a little before sunrise there was a terrible earthquake,\r\npreceded by incessant and furious lightning. The sea was driven\r\nbackwards, so as to recede from the land, and the very depths were\r\nuncovered, so that many marine animals were left sticking in the mud.\r\nAnd the depths of its valleys and the recesses of the hills, which from\r\nthe very first origin of all things had been lying beneath the boundless\r\nwaters, now beheld the beams of the sun.\r\n\r\n17. Many ships were stranded on the dry shore, while people straggling\r\nabout the shoal water picked up fishes and things of that kind in their\r\nhands. In another quarter the waves, as if raging against the violence\r\nwith which they had been driven back, rose, and swelling over the\r\nboiling shallows, beat upon the islands and the extended coasts of the\r\nmainland, levelling cities and houses wherever they encountered them.\r\nAll the elements were in furious discord, and the whole face of the\r\nworld seemed turned upside down, revealing the most extraordinary\r\nsights.\r\n\r\n18. For the vast waves subsided when it was least expected, and thus\r\ndrowned many thousand men. Even ships were swallowed up in the furious\r\ncurrents of the returning tide, and were seen to sink when the fury of\r\nthe sea was exhausted; and the bodies of those who perished by shipwreck\r\nfloated about on their backs or faces.\r\n\r\n19. Other vessels of great size were driven on shore by the violence of\r\nthe wind, and cast upon the housetops, as happened at Alexandria; and\r\nsome were even driven two miles inland, of which we ourselves saw one in\r\nLaconia, near the town of Mothone, which was lying and rotting where it\r\nhad been driven.\r\n\r\n\r\n[157] Master of the Offices--v.

While these events which we have related were taking place with\r\nvarious consequences in the east, the Allemanni, after the many\r\ndisasters and defeats which they had received in their frequent contests\r\nwith the emperor Julian, at length, having recruited their strength,\r\nthough not to a degree equal to their former condition, for the reason\r\nwhich has been already set forth, crossed the frontier of Gaul in\r\nformidable numbers. And immediately after the beginning of the year,\r\nwhile winter was still in its greatest severity in those frozen\r\ndistricts, a vast multitude poured forth in a solid column, plundering\r\nall the places around in the most licentious manner.\r\n\r\n2. Their first division was met by Charietto, who at that time had the\r\nauthority of count in both the German provinces, and who marched against\r\nthem with his most active troops, having with him as a colleague count\r\nSeverianus, a man of great age and feeble health, who had the legions\r\nDivitenses and Tungricana under his command, near Cabillonum\r\n(Châlons).[160]\r\n\r\n3. Then having formed the whole force into one solid body, and having\r\nwith great rapidity thrown a bridge over a small stream, the Romans\r\nassailed the barbarians from a distance with arrows and light javelins,\r\nwhich they shot back at us with great vigour.\r\n\r\n4. But when the battalions met and fought with drawn swords, our line\r\nwas shaken by the vehement onset of the enemy, and could neither resist\r\nnor do any valorous deeds by way of attack, but were all put to flight\r\nas soon as they saw Severianus struck down from his horse and severely\r\nwounded by an arrow.\r\n\r\n5. Charietto, too, while labouring by the exposure of his own person,\r\nand with bitter reproaches, to encourage his men, who were giving way,\r\nand while by the gallantry with which he maintained his own position he\r\nstrove to efface the disgrace they were incurring, was slain by a mortal\r\nwound from a javelin.\r\n\r\n6. And after his death the standard of the Eruli and of the Batavi was\r\nlost, and the barbarians raised it on high, insulting it, dancing round\r\nit, but after a fierce struggle it was recovered.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nA.D. 367.\r\n\r\n§ 1. The news of this disaster was received with great sorrow, and\r\nDagalaiphus was sent from Paris to restore affairs to order. But as he\r\ndelayed some time, and made excuses, alleging that he was unable to\r\nattack the barbarians, who were dispersed over various districts, and as\r\nhe was soon after sent for to receive the consulship with Gratian, who\r\nwas still only a private individual, Jovinus was appointed commander of\r\nthe cavalry; and he being well provided and fully prepared, attacked the\r\nfortress of Churpeigne, protecting both his wings and flanks with great\r\ncare. And at this place he fell on the barbarians unexpectedly, before\r\nthey could arm themselves, and in a very short time utterly destroyed\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n2. Then leading on the soldiers while exulting in the glory of this easy\r\nvictory, to defeat the other divisions, and advancing slowly, he learnt\r\nfrom the faithful report of his scouts that a band of ravagers, after\r\nhaving plundered the villages around, were resting on the bank of the\r\nriver. And as he approached, while his army was concealed by the lowness\r\nof the ground and the thickness of the trees, he saw some of them\r\nbathing, some adorning their hair after their fashion, and some\r\ncarousing.\r\n\r\n3. And seizing this favourable opportunity, he suddenly bade the trumpet\r\ngive the signal, and burst into the camp of the marauders. On the other\r\nhand, the Germans could do nothing but pour forth useless threats and\r\nshouts, not being allowed time to collect their scattered arms, or to\r\nform in any strength, so vigorously were they pressed by the conquerors.\r\nThus numbers of them fell pierced with javelins and swords, and many\r\ntook to flight, and were saved by the winding and narrow paths.\r\n\r\n4. After this success, which was won by valour and good fortune, Jovinus\r\nstruck his camp without delay, and led on his soldiers with increased\r\nconfidence (sending out a body of careful scouts in advance) against the\r\nthird division. And arriving at Châlons by forced marches, he there\r\nformed the whole body ready for battle.\r\n\r\n5. And having constructed a rampart with seasonable haste, and refreshed\r\nhis men with food and sleep as well as the time permitted, at daybreak\r\nhe arranged his army in an open plain, extending his line with admirable\r\nskill, in order that by occupying an extensive space of ground the\r\nRomans might appear to be equal in number to the enemy: being in fact\r\ninferior in that respect though equal in strength.\r\n\r\n6. Accordingly, when the trumpet gave the signal and the battle began to\r\nrage at close quarters, the Germans stood amazed, alarmed at the\r\nwell-known appearance of the shining standards. But though they were\r\nchecked for a moment, they presently recovered themselves, and the\r\nconflict was protracted till the close of the day, when our valorous\r\ntroops would have reaped the fruit of their gallantry without any loss\r\nif it had not been for Balchobaudes, a tribune of the legions, who being\r\nas sluggish as he was boastful, at the approach of evening retreated in\r\ndisorder to the camp. And if the rest of the cohorts had followed his\r\nexample and had also retired, the affair would have turned out so\r\nruinous that not one of our men would have been left alive to tell what\r\nhad happened.\r\n\r\n7. But our soldiers, persisting with energy and courage, showed such a\r\nsuperiority in personal strength that they wounded four thousand of the\r\nenemy and slew six thousand, while they did not themselves lose more\r\nthan twelve hundred killed and two hundred wounded.\r\n\r\n8. At the approach of night the battle terminated, and our weary men\r\nhaving recruited their strength, a little before dawn our skilful\r\ngeneral led forth his army in a square, and found that the barbarians\r\nhad availed themselves of the darkness to escape. And having no fear\r\nthere of ambuscade, he pursued them over the open plain, trampling on\r\nthe dying and the dead, many of whom had perished from the effect of the\r\nseverity of the cold on their wounds.\r\n\r\n9. After he had advanced some way further, without finding any of the\r\nenemy he returned, and then he learnt that the king of the hostile army\r\nhad been taken prisoner, with a few followers, by the Ascarii,[161] whom\r\nhe himself had sent by another road to plunder the tents of the\r\nAllemanni, and they had hanged him. But the general being angry at this,\r\nordered the punishment of the tribune who had ventured on such an act\r\nwithout consulting his superior officer, and he would have condemned him\r\nif he had not been able to establish by manifest proof that the\r\natrocious act had been committed by the violent impulse of the soldiers.\r\n\r\n10. After this, when he returned to Paris with the glory of this\r\nsuccess, the emperor met him with joy, and appointed him to be consul\r\nthe next year, being additionally rejoiced because at the very same time\r\nhe received the head of Procopius, which had been sent to him by Valens.\r\n\r\n11. Besides these events, many other battles of inferior interest and\r\nimportance took place in Gaul, which it would be superfluous to recount,\r\nsince they brought no results worth mentioning, and it is not fit to\r\nspin out history with petty details.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. At this time, or a little before, a new kind of prodigy appeared in\r\nthe corn district of Tuscany; those who were skilful in interpreting\r\nsuch things being wholly ignorant of what it portended. For in the town\r\nof Pistoja, at about the third hour of the day, in the sight of many\r\npersons, an ass mounted the tribunal, where he was heard to bray loudly.\r\nAll the bystanders were amazed, as were all those who heard of the\r\noccurrence from the report of others, as no one could conjecture what\r\nwas to happen.\r\n\r\n2. But soon afterwards the events showed what was portended, for a man\r\nof the name of Terence, a person of low birth and a baker by trade, as a\r\nreward for having given information against Orsitus, who had formerly\r\nbeen prefect, which led to his being convicted of peculation, was\r\nintrusted with the government of this same province. And becoming elated\r\nand confident, he threw affairs into great disorder, till he was\r\nconvicted of fraud on transactions relating to some ship-masters, as was\r\nreported, and was executed while Claudius was prefect of Rome.\r\n\r\n3. But some time before this happened Symmachus succeeded Apronianus; a\r\nman deserving to be named among the most eminent examples of learning\r\nand moderation; under whose government the most sacred city enjoyed\r\npeace and plenty in an unusual degree; being also adorned with a\r\nmagnificent and solid bridge which he constructed, and opened amid the\r\ngreat joy of his ungrateful fellow-citizens, as the result very plainly\r\nshowed.\r\n\r\n4. For they some years afterwards burnt his beautiful house on the other\r\nside of the Tiber, being enraged because some worthless plebeian had\r\ninvented a story, which there was no evidence or witness to support,\r\nthat he had said that he would prefer putting out the limekilns with his\r\nown wine, to selling the lime at the price expected of him.\r\n\r\n5. After him the prefect of the city was Lampadius, who had been\r\nprefect of the prætorium, a man of such boundless arrogance, that he\r\ngrew very indignant if he were not praised even when he spat, as if he\r\ndid that with more grace than any one else; but still a man of justice,\r\nvirtue, and economy.\r\n\r\n6. When as prætor he was celebrating some splendid games, and giving\r\nabundant largesses, being unable to bear the tumult of the populace,\r\nwhich was often urgent to have gifts distributed to those who were\r\nunworthy, in order to show his liberality and his contempt for the\r\nmultitude, he sent for a crowd of beggars from the Vatican, and enriched\r\nthem with great presents.\r\n\r\n7. But, not to digress too much, it will be sufficient to record one\r\ninstance of his vanity, which, though of no great importance, may serve\r\nas a warning to judges. In every quarter of the city which had been\r\nadorned at the expense of different emperors he inscribed his own name,\r\nand that, not as if he were the restorer of old works, but their\r\nfounder. This same fault is said to have characterized the emperor\r\nTrajan, from which the people in jest named him \"The Pellitory of the\r\nwall.\"\r\n\r\n8. While he was prefect he was disturbed by frequent commotions, the\r\nmost formidable being when a vast mob of the lowest of the people\r\ncollected, and with firebrands and torches would have burnt his house\r\nnear the baths of Constantine, if they had not been driven away by the\r\nprompt assistance of his friends and neighbours, who pelted them with\r\nstones and tiles from the tops of the houses.\r\n\r\n9. And he himself, being alarmed at a sedition, which on this occasion\r\nhad become so violent, retired to the Mulvian bridge (which the elder\r\nScaurus is said to have built), and waited there till the discontent\r\nsubsided, which indeed had been excited by a substantial grievance.\r\n\r\n10. For when he began to construct some new buildings, he ordered the\r\ncost to be defrayed, not from the customary sources of revenue, but if\r\niron, or lead, or copper, or anything of that kind was required, he sent\r\nofficers who, pretending to try the different articles, did in fact\r\nseize them without paying any price for them. This so enraged the poor,\r\nsince they suffered repealed losses from such a practice, that it was\r\nall he could do to escape from them by a rapid retreat.\r\n\r\n11. His successor had formerly been a quæstor of the palace, his name\r\nwas Juventius, a man of integrity and prudence, a Pannonian by birth.\r\nHis administration was tranquil and undisturbed, and the people enjoyed\r\nplenty under it. Yet he also was alarmed by fierce seditions raised by\r\nthe discontented populace, which arose from the following occurrence.\r\n\r\n12. Damasus and Ursinus, being both immoderately eager to obtain the\r\nbishopric, formed parties and carried on the conflict with great\r\nasperity, the partisans of each carrying their violence to actual\r\nbattle, in which men were wounded and killed. And as Juventius was\r\nunable to put an end to, or even to soften these disorders, he was at\r\nlast by their violence compelled to withdraw to the suburbs.\r\n\r\n13. Ultimately Damasus got the best of the strife by the strenuous\r\nefforts of his partisans. It is certain that on one day one hundred and\r\nthirty-seven dead bodies were found in the Basilica of Sicininus, which\r\nis a Christian church.[162] And the populace who had been thus roused to\r\na state of ferocity were with great difficulty restored to order.\r\n\r\n14. I do not deny, when I consider the ostentation that reigns at Rome,\r\nthat those who desire such rank and power may be justified in labouring\r\nwith all possible exertion and vehemence to obtain their wishes; since\r\nafter they have succeeded, they will be secure for the future, being\r\nenriched by offerings from matrons, riding in carriages, dressing\r\nsplendidly, and feasting luxuriously, so that their entertainments\r\nsurpass even royal banquets.\r\n\r\n15. And they might be really happy if, despising the vastness of the\r\ncity, which they excite against themselves by their vices, they were to\r\nlive in imitation of some of the priests in the provinces, whom the most\r\nrigid abstinence in eating and drinking, and plainness of apparel, and\r\neyes always cast on the ground, recommend to the everlasting Deity and\r\nhis true worshippers as pure and sober-minded men. This is a sufficient\r\ndigression on this subject: let us now return to our narrative.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n§1. While the events above mentioned were taking place in Gaul and\r\nItaly, a new campaign was being prepared in Thrace. For Valens, acting\r\non the decision of his brother, by whose will he was entirely governed,\r\nmarched against the Goths, having a just cause of complaint against\r\nthem, because at the beginning of the late civil war they had sent\r\nassistance to Procopius. It will here be desirable to say a few words of\r\nthe origin of this people, and the situation of their country.\r\n\r\n2. The description of Thrace would be easy if the pens of ancient\r\nauthors agreed on the subject; but as the obscurity and variety of their\r\naccounts is of but little assistance to a work which professes to tell\r\nthe truth, it will be sufficient for us to record what we remember to\r\nhave seen ourselves.\r\n\r\n3. The undying authority of Homer informs us that these countries were\r\nformerly extended over an immense space of tranquil plains and high\r\nrising grounds; since that poet represents both the north and the west\r\nwind as blowing from thence;[163] a statement which is either fabulous,\r\nor else which shows that the extensive district inhabited by all those\r\nsavage tribes was formerly included under the single name of Thrace.\r\n\r\n4. Part of this region was inhabited by the Scordisci, who now live at a\r\ngreat distance from these provinces; a race formerly savage and\r\nuncivilized, as ancient history proves, sacrificing their prisoners to\r\nBellona and Mars, and drinking with eagerness human blood out of skulls.\r\nTheir ferocity engaged the Roman republic in many wars; and on one\r\noccasion led to the destruction of an entire army with its general.[164]\r\n\r\n5. But we see that the country now, the district being in the form of a\r\ncrescent, resembles a splendid theatre; it is bounded on the west by\r\nmountains, on the abrupt summit of which are the thickly wooded passes\r\nof the Succi, which separate Thrace from Dacia.\r\n\r\n6. On the left, or northern side, the heights of the Balkan form the\r\nboundary, as in one part does the Danube also, where it touches the\r\nRoman territory: a river with many cities, fortresses, and castles on\r\nits banks.\r\n\r\n7. On the right, or southern side, lies Mount Rhodope; on the east, the\r\ncountry is bounded by a strait, which becomes more rapid from being\r\nswollen by the waters of the Euxine sea, and proceeds onwards with its\r\ntides towards the Ægean, separating the continents of Europe and Asia by\r\na narrow space.\r\n\r\n8. At a confined corner on the eastward it joins the frontier of\r\nMacedonia by a strait and precipitous defile named Acontisma; near to\r\nwhich are the valley and station of Arethusa, where one may see the tomb\r\nof Euripides, illustrious for his sublime tragedies; and Stagira, where\r\nwe are told that Aristotle, who as Cicero says pours from his mouth a\r\ngolden stream, was born.\r\n\r\n9. In ancient times, tribes of barbarians occupied these countries,\r\ndiffering from each other in customs and language. The most formidable\r\nof which, from their exceeding ferocity, were the Odrysæans, men so\r\naccustomed to shed human blood, that when they could not find enemies\r\nenough, they would, at their feasts, when they had eaten and drunk to\r\nsatiety, stab their own bodies as if they belonged to others.\r\n\r\n10. But as the republic grew in strength while the authority of the\r\nconsular form of government prevailed, Marcus Didius, with great\r\nperseverance, attacked these tribes which had previously been deemed\r\ninvincible, and had roved about without any regard either to divine or\r\nhuman laws. Drusus compelled them to confine themselves to their own\r\nterritories; Minucius defeated them in a great battle on the river\r\nMaritza, which flows down from the lofty mountains of the Odrysæans; and\r\nafter those exploits, the rest of the tribes were almost destroyed in a\r\nterrible battle by Appius Claudius the proconsul. And the Roman fleets\r\nmade themselves masters of the towns on the Bosporus, and on the coast\r\nof the Sea of Marmora.\r\n\r\n11. After these generals came Lucullus; who was the first of all our\r\ncommanders who fought with the warlike nation of the Bessi: and with\r\nsimilar vigour he crushed the mountaineers of the district of the\r\nBalkan, in spite of their obstinate resistance. And while he was in that\r\ncountry the whole of Thrace was brought under the power of our\r\nancestors, and in this way, after many doubtful campaigns, six provinces\r\nwere added to the republic.\r\n\r\n12. Of these provinces the first one comes to, that which borders on the\r\nIllyrians, is called by the especial name of Thrace; its chief cities\r\nare Philippopolis, the ancient Eumolpias, and Beræa; both splendid\r\ncities. Next to this the province of the Balkan boasts of Hadrianople,\r\nwhich used to be called Uscudama, and Anchialos, both great cities. Nest\r\ncomes Mysia, in which is Marcianopolis, so named from the sister of the\r\nemperor Trajan, also Dorostorus, and Nicopolis, Odyssus.\r\n\r\n13. Next comes Scythia, in which the chief towns are Dionysiopolis,\r\nTomis, and Calatis. The last of all is Europa; which besides many\r\nmunicipal towns has two principal cities, Apri and Perinthus, which in\r\nlater times has received the name of Heraclea. Beyond this is Rhodope,\r\nin which are the cities of Maximianopolis, Maronea, and Ænus, after\r\nfounding and leaving which, it was thought Æneas proceeded onwards to\r\nItaly, of which, after long wanderings, he became master, expecting by\r\nthe auspices to enjoy there perpetual prosperity.\r\n\r\n14. But it is certain, as the invariable accounts of all writers\r\nrepresent, that these tribes were nearly all agricultural, and, that\r\nliving on the high mountains in these regions above mentioned, they are\r\nsuperior to us in health, vigour, and length of life; and they believe\r\nthat this superiority arises from the fact, that in their food they for\r\nthe most part abstain from all that is hot; also that the constant dews\r\nbesprinkle their persons with a cold and bracing moisture, and that\r\nthey enjoy the freshness of a purer atmosphere; and that they are the\r\nfirst of all tribes to feel the rays of the morning sun, which are\r\ninstinct with life, before they become tainted with any of the foulness\r\narising from human things. Having discussed this matter let us now\r\nreturn to our original narrative.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n§ 1. After Procopius had been overpowered in Phrygia, and all material\r\nfor domestic discords had thus been removed, Victor, the commander of\r\nthe cavalry, was sent to the Goths to inquire, without disguise, why a\r\nnation friendly to the Romans, and bound to it by treaties of equitable\r\npeace, had given the support of its arms to a man who was waging war\r\nagainst their lawful emperor. And they, to excuse their conduct by a\r\nvalid defence, produced the letters from the above-mentioned Procopius,\r\nin which he alleged that he had assumed the sovereignty as his due, as\r\nthe nearest relation to Constantine's family; and they asserted that\r\nthis was a fair excuse for their error.\r\n\r\n2. When Victor reported this allegation of theirs, Valens disregarding\r\nit as a frivolous excuse, marched against them, they having already got\r\ninformation of his approach. And at the beginning of spring he assembled\r\nhis army in a great body, and pitched his camp near a fortress named\r\nDaphne, where having made a bridge of boats he crossed the Danube\r\nwithout meeting any resistance.\r\n\r\n3. And being now full of elation and confidence, as while traversing the\r\ncountry in every direction he met with no enemy to be either defeated or\r\neven alarmed by his advance; they having all been so terrified at the\r\napproach of so formidable a host, that they had fled to the high\r\nmountains of the Serri, which were inaccessible to all except those who\r\nknew the country.\r\n\r\n4. Therefore, that he might not waste the whole summer, and return\r\nwithout having effected anything, he sent forward Arinthæus, the captain\r\nof the infantry, with some light forces, who seized on a portion of\r\ntheir families, which were overtaken as they were wandering over the\r\nplains before coming to the steep and winding defiles of the mountains.\r\nAnd having obtained this advantage, which chance put in his way, he\r\nreturned with his men without having suffered any loss, and indeed\r\nwithout having inflicted any.\r\n\r\n5. The next year he attempted with equal vigour again to invade the\r\ncountry of the enemy; but being checked in his advance by the\r\ninundations of the Danube, which covered a wide extent of country, he\r\nremained near the town of Capri, where he pitched a camp in which he\r\nremained till the autumn. And from thence, as he was prevented from\r\nundertaking any operations on account of the magnitude of the floods, he\r\nretired to Marcianopolis into winter quarters.\r\n\r\n6. With similar perseverance he again invaded the land of the barbarians\r\na third year, having crossed the river by a bridge of boats at Nivors;\r\nand by a rapid march he attacked the Gruthungi, a warlike and very\r\nremote tribe, and after some trivial skirmishes, he defeated Athanaric,\r\nat that time the most powerful man of the tribe, who dared to resist him\r\nwith what he fancied an adequate force, but was compelled to flee for\r\nhis life. And then he returned himself with his army to Marcianopolis to\r\nspend the winter there, as the cold was but slight in that district.\r\n\r\n7. After many various events in the campaigns of three years, there\r\narose at last some very strong reasons in the minds of the barbarians\r\nfor terminating the war. In the first place, because the fear of the\r\nenemy was increased by the continued stay made by the emperor in that\r\ncountry. Secondly, because as all their commerce was cut off they began\r\nto feel great want of necessaries. So that they sent several embassies\r\nwith submissive entreaties for pardon and peace.\r\n\r\n8. The emperor was as yet inexperienced, but still he was a very just\r\nobserver of events, till having been captivated by the pernicious\r\nallurements of flattery, he subsequently involved the republic in an\r\never-to-be-lamented disaster; and now taking counsel for the common\r\ngood, he determined that it was right to grant them peace.\r\n\r\n9. And in his turn he sent to them Victor and Arinthæus, who at that\r\ntime were the commanders of his infantry and cavalry; and when they sent\r\nhim letters truly stating that the Goths were willing to agree to the\r\nconditions which they had proposed, he appointed a suitable place for\r\nfinally settling the terms of the peace. And since Athanaric alleged\r\nthat he was bound by a most dreadful oath, and also forbidden by the\r\nstrict commands of his father ever to set foot on the Roman territory,\r\nand as he could not be brought to do so, while, on the other hand, it\r\nwould be unbecoming and degrading for the emperor to cross over to him,\r\nit was decided by negotiation that some boats should be rowed into the\r\nmiddle of the river, on which the emperor should embark with an armed\r\nguard, and that there also the chief of the enemy should meet him with\r\nhis people, and conclude a peace as had been arranged.\r\n\r\n10. When this had been arranged, and hostages had been given, Valens\r\nreturned to Constantinople, whither afterwards Athanaric fled, when he\r\nwas driven from his native land by a faction among his kinsmen; and he\r\ndied in that city, and was buried with splendid ceremony according to\r\nthe Roman fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n§ 1. In the mean time, Valentinian being attacked with a violent\r\nsickness and at the point of death, at a secret entertainment of the\r\nGauls who were present in the emperor's army, Rusticus Julianus, at that\r\ntime master of the records, was proposed as the future emperor; a man as\r\ngreedy of human blood as a wild beast, seeming to be smitten with some\r\nfrenzy, as had been shown while governing Africa as proconsul.\r\n\r\n2. For in his prefecture of the city, a post which he was filling when\r\nhe died, fearing a change in the tyranny through the exercise of which\r\nhe, as if in a dearth of worthy men, had been raised to that dignity, he\r\nwas compelled to appear more gentle and merciful.\r\n\r\n3. Against his partisans others with higher aims were exerting\r\nthemselves in favour of Severus, who at that time was captain of the\r\ninfantry, as a man very fit for such a dignity, who, although rough and\r\nunpopular, seemed yet more tolerable than the other, and worthy of being\r\npreferred to him by any means that could be devised.\r\n\r\n4. But all these plans were formed to no purpose; for in the meantime,\r\nthe emperor, through the variety of remedies applied, recovered, and\r\nwould scarcely believe that his life had been saved with difficulty.\r\nAnd he proposed to invest his son Gratian, who was now on the point of\r\narriving at manhood, with the ensigns of the imperial authority.\r\n\r\n5. And when everything was prepared, and the consent of the soldiers\r\nsecured, in order that all men might willingly accept the new emperor,\r\nimmediately upon the arrival of Gratian, Valentinian advancing into the\r\nopen space, mounted the tribune, and surrounded by a splendid circle of\r\nnobles and princes, and holding the boy by his right hand, showed him to\r\nthem all, and in the following formal harangue recommended their\r\nintended sovereign to the army.\r\n\r\n6. \"This imperial robe which I wear is a happy indication of your good\r\nwill towards me when you adjudged me superior to many illustrious men.\r\nNow, with you as the partners of my counsels and the favourers of my\r\nwishes, I will proceed to a seasonable work of affection, relying on the\r\nprotecting promises of God, to whose eternal assistance it is owing that\r\nthe Roman state stands and ever shall stand unshaken.\r\n\r\n7. \"Listen, I beseech you, O most gallant men, with willing minds to my\r\ndesire, recollecting that these things which the laws of natural\r\naffection sanction, we have in this instance not only wished to\r\naccomplish with your perfect cognizance, but we have also desired to\r\nhave them confirmed by you as what is proper for us and likely to prove\r\nbeneficial.\r\n\r\n8. This, my grown-up son Gratian, to whom all of you bear affection as a\r\ncommon pledge, who has long lived among your own children, I am, for the\r\nsake of securing the public tranquillity on all sides, about to take as\r\nmy colleague in the imperial authority, if the propitious will of the\r\nruler of heaven and of your dignity, shall co-operate with a parent's\r\naffection. He has not been trained by a rigid education from his very\r\ncradle as we ourselves have; nor has he been equally taught to endure\r\nhardships; nor is he as yet, as you see, able to endure the toils of\r\nwar; but in his disposition he is not unworthy of the glorious\r\nreputation of his family, or the mighty deeds of his ancestors, and, I\r\nventure to say, he is likely to grow up equal to still greater actions.\r\n\r\n9. \"For as I often think when contemplating, as I am wont to do, his\r\nmanners and passions though not yet come to maturity, he is so furnished\r\nwith the liberal sciences, and in all accomplishments and graces, that\r\neven now, while only entering on manhood, he will be able to form an\r\naccurate judgment of virtuous and vicious actions. He will so conduct\r\nhimself that virtuous men may see that they are appreciated; he will be\r\neager in the performance of noble actions; he will never desert the\r\nmilitary standards and eagles; he will cheerfully bear heat, snow,\r\nfrost, and thirst; he will, if necessity should arise, never shrink from\r\nfighting in defence of his country; he will expose his life to save his\r\ncomrades from danger, and (and this is the highest and greatest work of\r\npiety) he will love the republic as his own paternal and ancestral\r\nhome.\"\r\n\r\n10. Before he had finished his speech, every soldier hastened to\r\nanticipate his comrades as well as his position permitted him, in\r\nshowing that these words of the emperor met with their cheerful assent.\r\nAnd so, as partakers in his joy, and as convinced of the advantage of\r\nhis proposal, they declared Gratian emperor, mingling the propitious\r\nclashing of their arms with the loud roar of the trumpets.\r\n\r\n11. When Valentinian saw this, his confidence increased; he adorned his\r\nson with a crown and with the robes befitting his now supreme rank, and\r\nkissed him; and then thus addressed him, brilliant as he appeared, and\r\ngiving careful attention to all his words:--\r\n\r\n12. \"You wear now,\" said he, \"my Gratian, the imperial robe, as we have\r\nall desired, which has been conferred on you with favourable auspices by\r\nmy will and that of our comrades. Therefore now, considering the weight\r\nof the affairs which press upon us, gird yourself up as the colleague of\r\nyour father and your uncle; and accustom yourself to pass fearlessly\r\nwith the infantry over the Danube and the Rhine, which are made passable\r\nby the frost, to keep close to your soldiers, to devote your blood and\r\nyour very life with all skill and deliberation for the safety of those\r\nunder your command; to think nothing unworthy of your attention which\r\nconcerns any portion of the Roman empire.\r\n\r\n13. \"This is enough by way of admonition to you at the present moment,\r\nat other times I will not fail to give further advice. Now you who\r\nremain, the defenders of the state, I entreat, I beseech you to preserve\r\nwith a steady affection and loyalty your youthful emperor thus intrusted\r\nto your fidelity.\"\r\n\r\n14. These words of the emperor were accepted and ratified with all\r\npossible solemnity; Eupraxius, a native of Mauritania Cæsariensis, at\r\nthat time master of the records, led the way by the exclamation, \"The\r\nfamily of Gratian deserves this.\" And being at once promoted to be\r\nquæstor, he set an example of judicious confidence worthy of being\r\nimitated by all wise men; especially as he in no wise departed from the\r\nhabits of his fearless nature, but was at all times a man of consistency\r\nand obedient to the laws, which, as we have remarked, speak to all men\r\nwith one and the same voice under the most varied circumstances. He at\r\nthis time was the more steady in adhering to the side of justice which\r\nhe always espoused, because on one occasion when he had given good\r\nadvice, the emperor had attacked him with violence and threats.\r\n\r\n15. After this, the whole assembly broke out into praises of both\r\nemperors, the elder and the new one; and especially of the boy, whose\r\nbrilliant eyes, engaging countenance and person, and apparent sweetness\r\nof disposition, recommended him to their favour. And these qualities\r\nwould have rendered him an emperor worthy to be compared to the most\r\nexcellent princes of former times, if fate had permitted, and his\r\nrelations who even then began to overshadow his virtue, before it was\r\nfirmly rooted, with their own wicked actions.\r\n\r\n16. But in this affair, Valentinian went beyond the custom which had\r\nbeen established for several generations, in making his brother and his\r\nson, not Cæsar, but emperors; acting indeed in this respect with great\r\nkindness. Nor had any one yet ever created a colleague with powers equal\r\nto his own, except the emperor Marcus Aurelius, who made his adopted\r\nbrother Verus his colleague in the empire without any inferiority of\r\npower.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nA.D. 368.\r\n\r\n§ 1. After these transactions had been thus settled to the delight both\r\nof the prince and of the soldiers, but a few days intervened; and then\r\nAvitianus, who had been deputy, accused Mamertinus, the prefect of the\r\nprætorium, of peculation, on his return from the city whither he had\r\ngone to correct some abuses.\r\n\r\n2. And in consequence of this accusation he was replaced by Rufinus, a\r\nman accomplished in every respect, who had attained the dignity of an\r\nhonourable old age, though it is true that he never let slip any\r\nopportunity of making money when he thought he could do so secretly.\r\n\r\n3. He now availed himself of his access to the emperor to obtain\r\npermission for Orfitus, who had been prefect of the city, but who was\r\nnow banished, to receive back his property which had been confiscated,\r\nand return home.\r\n\r\n4. And although Valentinian was a man of undisguised ferocity, he\r\nnevertheless, at the beginning of his reign, in order to lessen the\r\nopinion of his cruelty, took all possible pains to restrain the fierce\r\nimpetuosity of his disposition. But this defect increasing gradually,\r\nfrom having been checked for some time, presently broke out more\r\nunrestrained to the ruin of many persons; and his severity was increased\r\nby the vehemence of his anger. For wise men define passion as a lasting\r\nulcer of the mind, and sometimes an incurable one, usually engendered\r\nfrom a weakness of the intellect; and they have a plausible argument for\r\nasserting this in the fact that people in bad health are more passionate\r\nthan those who are well; women, than men; old men, than youths; and\r\npeople in bad circumstances than the prosperous.\r\n\r\n5. About this time, among the deaths of many persons of low degree, that\r\nof Diocles, who had previously been a treasurer of Illyricum, was\r\nespecially remarked; the emperor having had him burnt alive for some\r\nvery slight offence, as was also the execution of Diodorus, who had\r\npreviously had an honourable employment in the provinces, and also that\r\nof three officers of the vicar prefect of Italy, who were all put to\r\ndeath with great cruelty because the count of Italy had complained to\r\nthe emperor that Diodorus had, though in a constitutional manner,\r\nimplored the aid of the law against him; and that the officers, by\r\ncommand of the judge, served a summons on him as he was setting out on a\r\njourney, commanding him to answer to the action according to law. And\r\nthe Christians at Milan to this day cherish their memory, and call the\r\nplace where they were buried, the tomb of the innocents.\r\n\r\n6. Afterwards, in the affair of a certain Pannonian, named Maxentius, on\r\naccount of the execution of a sentence very properly commanded by the\r\njudge to be carried out immediately, he ordered all the magistrates of\r\nthese towns to be put to death, when Eupraxius, who at that time was\r\nquæstor, interposed, saying, \"Be more sparing, O most pious of emperors,\r\nfor those whom you command to be put to death as criminals, the\r\nChristian religion honours as martyrs, that is as persons acceptable to\r\nthe deity.\"\r\n\r\n7. And the prefect Florentius, imitating the salutary boldness of\r\nEupraxius, when he heard that the emperor was in a similar manner very\r\nangry about some trifling and pardonable matter, and that he had ordered\r\nthe execution of three of the magistrates in each of several cities,\r\nsaid to him, \"And what is to be done if any town has not got so many\r\nmagistrates? It will be necessary to suspend the execution there till\r\nthere are a sufficient number for the purpose.\"\r\n\r\n8. And besides this cruel conduct there was another circumstance\r\nhorrible even to speak of, that if any one came before him protesting\r\nagainst being judged by a powerful enemy, and requiring that some other\r\njudge might hear his case, he always refused it; and however just the\r\narguments of the man might be, he remitted his cause to the decision of\r\nthe very judge whom he feared. And there was another very bad thing much\r\nspoken of; namely, that when it was urged that any debtor was in such\r\nabsolute want as to be unable to pay anything, he used to pronounce\r\nsentence of death on him.\r\n\r\n9. But some princes do these and other similar actions with the more\r\nlofty arrogance, because they never allow their friends any opportunity\r\nof setting them right in any mistake they make, either in a plan or in\r\nits execution; while they terrify their enemies by the greatness of\r\ntheir power. There can be no question of mistake or error raised before\r\nmen who consider whatever they choose to do to be in itself the greatest\r\nof virtues.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. Valentinian having left Amiens, and being on his way to Treves in\r\ngreat haste, received the disastrous intelligence that Britain was\r\nreduced by the ravages of the united barbarians to the lowest extremity\r\nof distress; that Nectaridus, the count of the sea-coast, had been slain\r\nin battle, and the duke Fullofaudes had been taken prisoner by the enemy\r\nin an ambuscade.\r\n\r\n2. This news struck him with great consternation, and he immediately\r\nsent Severus, the count of the domestic guards, to put an end to all\r\nthese disasters if he could find a desirable opportunity. Severus was\r\nsoon recalled, and Jovinus, who then went to that country, sent forward\r\nProvertuides with great expedition to ask for the aid of a powerful\r\narmy; for they both affirmed that the imminence of the danger required\r\nsuch a reinforcement.\r\n\r\n3. Last of all, on account of the many formidable reports which a\r\ncontinual stream of messengers brought from that island, Theodosius was\r\nappointed to proceed thither, and ordered to make great haste. He was an\r\nofficer already distinguished for his prowess in war, and having\r\ncollected a numerous force of cavalry and infantry, he proceeded to\r\nassume the command in full confidence.\r\n\r\n4. And since when I was compiling my account of the acts of the emperor\r\nConstantine, I explained as well as I could the movement of the sea in\r\nthose parts at its ebb and flow, and the situation of Britain, I look\r\nupon it as superfluous to return to what has been once described; as the\r\nUlysses of Homer when among the Phæacians hesitated to repeat his\r\nadventures by reason of the sufferings they brought to mind.\r\n\r\n5. It will be sufficient here to mention that at that time the Picts,\r\nwho were divided into two nations, the Dicalidones and the Vecturiones,\r\nand likewise the Attacotti, a very warlike people, and the Scots were\r\nall roving over different parts of the country and committing great\r\nravages. While the Franks and the Saxons who are on the frontiers of the\r\nGauls were ravaging their country wherever they could effect an entrance\r\nby sea or land, plundering and burning, and murdering all the prisoners\r\nthey could take.\r\n\r\n6. To put a stop to these evils, if a favourable fortune should afford\r\nan opportunity, the new and energetic general repaired to that island\r\nsituated at the extreme corner of the earth; and when he had reached the\r\ncoast of Boulogne, which is separated from the opposite coast by a very\r\nnarrow strait of the sea, which there rises and falls in a strange\r\nmanner, being raised by violent tides, and then again sinking to a\r\nperfect level like a plain, without doing any injury to the sailors.\r\nFrom Boulogne he crossed the strait in a leisurely manner, and reached\r\nRichborough, a very tranquil station on the opposite coast.\r\n\r\n7. And when the Batavi, and Heruli, and the Jovian and Victorian legions\r\nwho followed from the same place, had also arrived, he then, relying on\r\ntheir number and power, landed and marched towards Londinium, an ancient\r\ntown which has since been named Augusta; and dividing his army into\r\nseveral detachments, he attacked the predatory and straggling bands of\r\nthe enemy who were loaded with the weight of their plunder, and having\r\nspeedily routed them while driving prisoners in chains and cattle before\r\nthem, he deprived them of their booty which they had carried off from\r\nthese miserable tributaries of Rome.\r\n\r\n8. To whom he restored the whole except a small portion which he\r\nallotted to his own weary soldiers; and then joyful and triumphant he\r\nmade his entry into the city which had just before been overwhelmed by\r\ndisasters, but was now suddenly re-established almost before it could\r\nhave hoped for deliverance.\r\n\r\n9. This success encouraged him to deeds of greater daring, and after\r\nconsidering what counsels might be the safest, he hesitated, being full\r\nof doubts as to the future, and convinced by the confession of his\r\nprisoners and the information given him by deserters, that so vast a\r\nmultitude, composed of various nations, all incredibly savage, could\r\nonly be vanquished by secret stratagems and unexpected attacks.\r\n\r\n10. Then, by the publication of several edicts, in which he promised\r\nthem impunity, he invited deserters and others who were straggling about\r\nthe country on furlough, to repair to his camp. At this summons numbers\r\ncame in, and he, though eager to advance, being detained by anxious\r\ncares, requested to have Civilis sent to him, to govern Britain, with\r\nthe rank of proprefect, a man of quick temper, but just and upright; and\r\nhe asked at the same time for Dulcitius, a general eminent for his\r\nmilitary skill.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\n§ 1. These were the events which occurred in Britain. But in another\r\nquarter, from the very beginning of Valentinian's reign, Africa had been\r\noverrun by the fury of the barbarians, intent on bloodshed and rapine,\r\nwhich they sought to carry on by audacious incursions. Their\r\nlicentiousness was encouraged by the indolence and general covetousness\r\nof the soldiers, and especially by the conduct of Count Romanus.\r\n\r\n2. Who, foreseeing what was likely to happen, and being very skilful in\r\ntransferring to others the odium which he himself deserved, was detested\r\nby men in general for the savageness of his temper, and also because it\r\nseemed as if his object was to outrun even our enemies in ravaging the\r\nprovinces. He greatly relied on his relationship to Remigius, at that\r\ntime master of the offices, who sent all kinds of false and confused\r\nstatements of the condition of the country, so that the emperor,\r\ncautious and wary as he plumed himself on being, was long kept in\r\nignorance of the terrible sufferings of the Africans.\r\n\r\n3. I will explain with great diligence the complete series of all the\r\ntransactions which took place in those regions, the death of Ruricius\r\nthe governor, and of his lieutenants, and all the other mournful events\r\nwhich took place, when the proper opportunity arrives.\r\n\r\n4. And since we are able here to speak freely, let us openly say what we\r\nthink, that this emperor was the first of all our princes who raised the\r\narrogance of the soldiers to so great a height, to the great injury of\r\nthe state, by increasing their rank, dignity, and riches. And (which was\r\na lamentable thing, both on public and private accounts) while he\r\npunished the errors of the common soldiers with unrelenting severity, he\r\nspared the officers, who, as if complete licence were given to their\r\nmisconduct, proceeded to all possible lengths of rapacity and cruelty\r\nfor the acquisition of riches, and acting as if they thought that the\r\nfortunes of all persons depended directly on their nod.\r\n\r\n5. The framers of our ancient laws had sought to repress their pride and\r\npower, sometimes even condemning the innocent to death, as is often done\r\nin cases when, from the multitude concerned in some atrocity, some\r\ninnocent men, owing to their ill luck, suffer for the whole. And this\r\nhas occasionally extended even to the case of private persons.\r\n\r\n6. But in Isauria the banditti formed into bodies and roamed through the\r\nvillages, laying waste and plundering the towns and wealthy country\r\nhouses; and by the magnitude of their ravages they also greatly\r\ndistressed Pamphylia and Cilicia. And when Musonius, who at that time\r\nwas the deputy of Asia Minor, having previously been a master of\r\nrhetoric at Athens, had heard that they were spreading massacre and\r\nrapine in every direction, being filled with grief at the evil of which\r\nhe had just heard, and perceiving that the soldiers were rusting in\r\nluxury and inactivity, he took with him a few light-armed troops, called\r\nDiogmitæ, and resolved to attack the first body of plunderers he could\r\nfind. His way led through a narrow and most difficult defile, and thus\r\nhe fell into an ambuscade, which he had no chance of escaping, and was\r\nslain, with all the men under his command.\r\n\r\n7. The robber bands became elated at this advantage, and roamed over the\r\nwhole country with increased boldness, slaying many, till at last our\r\narmy was aroused, and drove them to take refuge amid the recesses of the\r\nrocks and mountains they inhabit. And then, as they were not allowed to\r\nrest, and were cut off from all means of obtaining necessary supplies,\r\nthey at last begged for a truce, as a prelude to peace, being led to\r\nthis step by the advice of the people of Germanicopolis, whose opinions\r\nalways had as much weight with them as standard-bearers have with an\r\narmy. And after giving hostages as they were desired, they remained for\r\na long time quiet, without venturing on any hostilities.\r\n\r\n8. While these events were taking place, Prætextatus was administering\r\nthe prefecture of the city in a noble manner, exhibiting numerous\r\ninstances of integrity and probity, virtues for which he had been\r\neminent from his earliest youth; and thus he obtained what rarely\r\nhappens to any one, that while he was feared, he did not at the same\r\ntime lose the affection of his fellow-citizens, which is seldom strongly\r\nfelt for those whom they fear as judges.\r\n\r\n9. By his authority, impartiality, and just decisions, a tumult was\r\nappeased, which the quarrels of the Christians had excited, and after\r\nUrsinus was expelled complete tranquillity was restored, which best\r\ncorresponded to the wishes of the Roman people; while the glory of their\r\nillustrious governor, who performed so many useful actions, continually\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\n10. For he also removed all the balconies, which the ancient laws of\r\nRome had forbidden to be constructed, and separated from the sacred\r\ntemples the walls of private houses which had been improperly joined to\r\nthem; and established one uniform and proper weight in every quarter,\r\nfor by no other means could he check the covetousness of those who made\r\ntheir scales after their own pleasure. And in the adjudication of\r\nlawsuits he exceeded all men in obtaining that praise which Cicero\r\nmentions in his panegyric of Brutus, that while he did nothing with a\r\nview to please anybody, everything which he did pleased everybody.\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\n§ 1. About the same time, when Valentinian had gone forth on an\r\nexpedition very cautiously as he fancied, a prince of the Allemanni, by\r\nname Rando, who had been for some time preparing for the execution of a\r\nplan which he had conceived, with a body of light-armed troops equipped\r\nonly for a predatory expedition, surprised and stormed Mayence, which\r\nwas wholly destitute of a garrison.\r\n\r\n2. And as he arrived at the time when a great solemnity of the Christian\r\nreligion was being celebrated, he found no obstacle whatever in\r\ncarrying off a vast multitude of both men and women as prisoners, with\r\nno small quantity of goods as booty.\r\n\r\n3. After this, for a short interval a sudden hope of brighter fortune\r\nshone upon the affairs of Rome. For as king Vithicabius, the son of\r\nVadomarius, a bold and warlike man, though in appearance effeminate and\r\ndiseased, was continually raising up the troubles of war against us,\r\ngreat pains were taken to have him removed by some means or other.\r\n\r\n4. And because after many attempts it was found impossible to defeat him\r\nor to procure his betrayal, his most confidential servant was tampered\r\nwith by one of our men, and by his hand he lost his life; and after his\r\ndeath, all hostile attacks upon us were laid aside for a while. But his\r\nmurderer, fearing punishment if the truth should get abroad, without\r\ndelay took refuge in the Roman territory.\r\n\r\n5. After this an expedition on a larger scale than usual was projected\r\nwith great care and diligence against the Allemanni, to consist of a\r\ngreat variety of troops: the public safety imperatively required such a\r\nmeasure, since the treacherous movements of that easily recruited nation\r\nwere regarded with continual apprehension, while our soldiers were the\r\nmore irritated, because, on account of the constant suspicion which\r\ntheir character awakened, at one time abject and suppliant, at another\r\narrogant and threatening, they were never allowed to rest in peace.\r\n\r\n6. Accordingly, a vast force was collected from all quarters, well\r\nfurnished with arms and supplies of provisions, and the count Sebastian\r\nhaving been sent for with the Illyrian and Italian legions which he\r\ncommanded, as soon as the weather got warm, Valentinian, accompanied by\r\nGratian, crossed the Rhine without resistance. Having divided the whole\r\narmy into four divisions, he himself marched with the centre, while\r\nJovinus and Severus, the two captains of the camp, commanded the\r\ndivisions on each side, thus protecting the army from any sudden attack.\r\n\r\n7. And immediately under the guidance of men who knew the roads, all the\r\napproaches having been reconnoitred, the army advanced slowly through a\r\nmost extensive district, the soldiers by the slowness of their march\r\nbeing all the more excited to wish for battle, and gnashing their teeth\r\nin a threatening manner, as if they had already found the barbarians.\r\nAnd as, after many days had passed, no one could be found who offered\r\nany resistance, the troops applied the devouring flame to all the houses\r\nand all the crops which were standing, with the exception of such\r\nsupplies for their own magazines as the doubtful events of war compelled\r\nthem to collect and store up.\r\n\r\n8. After this the emperor advanced further, with no great speed, till he\r\narrived at a place called Solicinium, where he halted, as if he had\r\nsuddenly come upon some barrier, being informed by the accurate report\r\nof his advanced guard that the barbarians were seen at a distance.\r\n\r\n9. They, seeing no way of preserving their safety unless they defended\r\nthemselves by a speedy battle, trusting in their acquaintance with the\r\ncountry, with one consent occupied a lofty hill, abrupt and inaccessible\r\nin its rugged heights on every side except the north, where the ascent\r\nwas gentle and easy. Our standards were fixed in the usual manner, and\r\nthe cry, \"To arms!\" was raised; and the soldiers, by the command of the\r\nemperor and his generals, rested in quiet obedience, waiting for the\r\nraising of the emperor's banner as the signal for engaging in battle.\r\n\r\n10. And because little or no time could be spared for deliberation,\r\nsince on one side the impatience of the soldiers was formidable, and on\r\nthe other the Allemanni were shouting out their horrid yells all around,\r\nthe necessity for rapid operations led to the plan that Sebastian with\r\nhis division should seize the northern side of the hill, where we have\r\nsaid the ascent was gentle, in which position it was expected that, if\r\nfortune favoured him, he would be able easily to destroy the flying\r\nbarbarians. And when he, as had been arranged, had moved forward first,\r\nwhile Gratian was kept behind with the Jovian legion, that young prince\r\nbeing as yet of an age unfit for battle or for hard toil, Valentinian,\r\nlike a deliberate and prudent general, took off his helmet, and reviewed\r\nhis centuries and maniples, and not having informed any of the nobles\r\nof his secret intentions, and having sent back his numerous body of\r\nguards, went forward himself with a very small escort, whose courage and\r\nfidelity he could trust, to reconnoitre the foot of the hill, declaring\r\n(as he was always apt to think highly of his own skill) that it must be\r\npossible to find another path which led to the summit besides that which\r\nthe advanced guard had reported.\r\n\r\n11. He then, as he advanced by a devious track over ground strange to\r\nhim, and across pathless swamps, was very nearly being killed by the\r\nsudden attack of a band placed in an ambuscade on his flank, and being\r\ndriven to extremities, only escaped by spurring his horse to a gallop in\r\na different direction over a deep swamp, so at last, after being in the\r\nmost imminent danger, he rejoined his legions. But so great had been his\r\nperil that his chamberlain, who was carrying his helmet, which was\r\nadorned with gold and precious stones, disappeared, helmet and all,\r\nwhile the man's body could never be found, so that it could be known\r\npositively whether he were alive or dead.\r\n\r\n12. Then, when the men had been refreshed by rest, and the signal for\r\nbattle was raised, and the clang of warlike trumpets roused their\r\ncourage, two youths of prominent valour, eager to be the first to\r\nencounter the danger, dashed on with fearless impetuosity before the\r\nline of their comrades. One was of the band of Scutarii, by name\r\nSalvius, the other, Lupicinus, belonging to the Gentiles. They raised a\r\nterrible shout, brandished their spears, and when they reached the foot\r\nof the rocks, in spite of the efforts of the Allemanni to repel them,\r\npushed steadily on to the higher ground; while behind them came the main\r\nbody of the army, which following their lead over places rough with\r\nbrambles and rugged, at last, after vast exertions, reached the very\r\nsummit of the heights.\r\n\r\n13. Then again, with great spirit on both sides, the conflict raged with\r\nspears and swords. On our side the soldiers were more skilful in the art\r\nof war; on the other side the barbarians, ferocious but incautious,\r\nclosed with them in the mighty fray; while our army extending itself,\r\noutflanked them on both sides with its overlapping wings, the enemy's\r\nalarm being increased by our shouts, the neighing of the horses, and the\r\nclang of trumpets.\r\n\r\n14. Nevertheless they resisted with indomitable courage, and the battle\r\nwas for some time undecided; both sides exerted themselves to the\r\nutmost, and death was scattered almost equally.\r\n\r\n15. At last the barbarians were beaten down by the ardour of the Romans,\r\nand being disordered and broken, were thrown into complete confusion;\r\nand as they began to retreat they were assailed with great effect by the\r\nspears and javelins of their enemies. Soon the retreat became a flight,\r\nand panting and exhausted, they exposed their backs and the back sinews\r\nof their legs and thighs to their pursuers. After many had been slain,\r\nthose who fled fell into the ambuscade laid for them by Sebastian, who\r\nwas posted with his reserve at the back of the mountain, and who now\r\nfell unexpectedly on their flank, and slew numbers of them, while the\r\nrest who escaped concealed themselves in the recesses of the woods.\r\n\r\n16. In this battle we also suffered no inconsiderable loss. Among those\r\nwho fell was Valerian, the first officer of the domestic guards, and one\r\nof the Scutarii, named Natuspardo, a warrior of such pre-eminent courage\r\nthat he might be compared to the ancient Sicinius or Sergius.\r\n\r\n17. After these transactions, accompanied with this diversity of\r\nfortune, the army went into winter quarters, and the emperor returned to\r\nTreves.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\n§ 1. About this time, Vulcatius Rufinus died, while filling the office\r\nof prefect of the prætorium, and Probus was summoned from Rome to\r\nsucceed him, a man well known to the whole Roman world for the eminence\r\nof his family, and his influence, as well as for his vast riches, for he\r\npossessed a patrimonial inheritance which was scattered over the whole\r\nempire; whether acquired justly or unjustly it is not for us to decide.\r\n\r\n2. A certain good fortune, as the poets would represent it, attended him\r\nfrom his birth, and bore him on her rapid wings, exhibiting him\r\nsometimes as a man of beneficent character, promoting the interests of\r\nhis friends, though often also a formidable intriguer, and cruel and\r\nmischievous in the gratification of his enmities. As long as he lived he\r\nhad great power, owing to the magnificence of his gifts and to his\r\nfrequent possession of office, and yet he was at times timid towards the\r\nbold, though domineering over the timid; so that when full of\r\nself-confidence he appeared to be spouting in the tragic buskin, and\r\nwhen he was afraid he seemed more abased than the most abject character\r\nin comedy.\r\n\r\n3. And as fishes, when removed from their natural element, cannot live\r\nlong on the land, so he began to pine when not in some post of authority\r\nwhich he was driven to be solicitous for by the squabbles of his troops\r\nof clients, whose boundless cupidity prevented their ever being\r\ninnocent, and who thrust their patron forward into affairs of state in\r\norder to be able to perpetrate all sorts of crimes with impunity.\r\n\r\n4. For it must be confessed that though he was a man of such magnanimity\r\nthat he never desired any dependent or servant of his to do an unlawful\r\nthing, yet if he found that any one of them had committed a crime, he\r\nlaid aside all consideration of justice, would not allow the case to be\r\ninquired into, but defended the man without the slightest regard for\r\nright or wrong. Now this is a fault expressly condemned by Cicero, who\r\nthus speaks: \"For what difference is there between one who has advised\r\nan action, and one who approves of it after it is performed? or what\r\ndifference does it make whether I wished it be done, or am glad that it\r\nis done?\"\r\n\r\n5. He was a man of a suspicious temper, self-relying, often wearing a\r\nbitter smile, and sometimes caressing a man the more effectually to\r\ninjure him.\r\n\r\n6. This vice is a very conspicuous one in dispositions of that kind, and\r\nmostly so when it is thought possible to conceal it. He was also so\r\nimplacable and obstinate in his enmities, that if he ever resolved to\r\ninjure any one he would never be diverted from his purpose by any\r\nentreaties, nor be led to pardon any faults, so that his ears seemed to\r\nbe stopped not with wax but with lead.\r\n\r\n7. Even when at the very summit of wealth and dignity he was always\r\nanxious and watchful, and therefore he was continually subject to\r\ntrifling illnesses.\r\n\r\n8. Such was the course of events which took place in the western\r\nprovinces of the empire.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. The King of Persia, the aged Sapor, who from the very commencement\r\nof his reign had been addicted to the love of plunder, after the death\r\nof the Emperor Julian, and the disgraceful treaty of peace subsequently\r\nmade, for a short time seemed with his people to be friendly to us; but\r\npresently he trampled under foot the agreement which he had made with\r\nJovian, and poured a body of troops into Armenia to annex that country\r\nto his own dominions, as if the whole of the former arrangements had\r\nbeen abolished.\r\n\r\n2. At first he contented himself with various tricks, intrigues, and\r\ndeceits, inflicting some trifling injuries on the nation which\r\nunanimously resisted him, tampering with some of the nobles and satraps,\r\nand making sudden inroads into the districts belonging to others.\r\n\r\n3. Afterwards by a system of artful cajolery fortified by perjury, he\r\ngot their king Arsaces into his hands, having invited him to a banquet,\r\nwhen he ordered him to be seized and conducted to a secret chamber\r\nbehind, where his eyes were put out, and he was loaded with silver\r\nchains, which in that country is looked upon as a solace under\r\npunishment for men of rank, trifling though it be; then he removed him\r\nfrom his country to a fortress called Agabana, where he applied to him\r\nthe torture, and finally put him to death.\r\n\r\n4. After this, in order that his perfidy might leave nothing unpolluted,\r\nhaving expelled Sauromaces, whom the authority of the Romans had made\r\ngovernor of Hiberia, he conferred the government of that district on a\r\nman of the name of Aspacuras, even giving him a diadem, to mark the\r\ninsult offered to the decision of our emperors.\r\n\r\n5. And after these infamous actions he committed the charge of Armenia\r\nto an eunuch named Cylaces, and to Artabannes, a couple of deserters\r\nwhom he had received some time before (one of them having been prefect\r\nof that nation, and the other commander in-chief); and he enjoined them\r\nto use every exertion to destroy the town of Artogerassa, a place\r\ndefended by strong walls and a sufficient garrison, in which were the\r\ntreasures, and the wife and son of Arsaces.\r\n\r\n6. These generals commenced the siege as they were ordered. And as it is\r\na fortress placed on a very rugged mountain height, it was inaccessible\r\nat that time, while the ground was covered with snow and frost: and so\r\nCylaces being an eunuch, and, as such, suited to feminine manoeuvres,\r\ntaking Artabannes with him, approached the walls; after having received\r\na promise of safety, and he and his companion had been admitted into the\r\ncity, he sought by a mixture of advice and threats to persuade the\r\ngarrison and the queen to pacify the wrath of the implacable Sapor by a\r\nspeedy surrender.\r\n\r\n7. And after many arguments had been urged on both sides, the woman\r\nbewailing the sad fortune of her husband, these men, who had been most\r\nactive in wishing to compel her to surrender, pitying her distress,\r\nchanged their views; and conceiving a hope of higher preferment, they in\r\nsecret conferences arranged that at an appointed hour of the night the\r\ngates should be suddenly thrown open, and a strong detachment should\r\nsally forth and fall upon the ramparts of the enemy's camp, surprising\r\nit with sudden slaughter; the traitors promising that, to prevent any\r\nknowledge of what was going on, they would come forward to meet them.\r\n\r\n8. Having ratified this agreement with an oath, they quitted the town,\r\nand led the besiegers to acquiesce in inaction by representing that the\r\nbesieged had required two days to deliberate on what course they ought\r\nto pursue. Then in the middle of the night, when they were all soundly\r\nasleep in fancied security, the gates of the city were thrown open, and\r\na strong body of young men poured forth with great speed, creeping on\r\nwith noiseless steps and drawn swords, till they entered the camp of the\r\nunsuspecting enemy, where they slew numbers of sleeping men, without\r\nmeeting with any resistance.\r\n\r\n8. This unexpected treachery of his officers, and the loss thus\r\ninflicted on the Persians, caused a terrible quarrel between us and\r\nSapor; and another cause for his anger was added, as the Emperor Valens\r\nreceived Para, the son of Arsaces, who at his mother's instigation had\r\nquitted the fortress with a small escort, and had desired him to stay at\r\nNeo-Cæsarea, a most celebrated city on the Black Sea, where he was\r\ntreated with great liberality and high respect. Cylaces and Artabannes,\r\nbeing allured by this humanity of Valens, sent envoys to him to ask for\r\nassistance, and to request that Para might be given them for their king.\r\n\r\n10. However, for the moment assistance was refused them; but Para was\r\nconducted by the general Terentius back to Armenia, where he was to rule\r\nthat nation without any of the insignia of royalty; which was a very\r\nwise regulation, in order that we might not be accused of breaking our\r\ntreaty of peace.\r\n\r\n11. When this arrangement became known, Sapor was enraged beyond all\r\nbounds, and collecting a vast army, entered Armenia and ravaged it with\r\nthe most ferocious devastation. Para was terrified at his approach, as\r\nwere also Cylaces and Artabannes, and, as they saw no other resource,\r\nfled into the recesses of the lofty mountains which separate our\r\nfrontiers from Lazica; where they hid in the depths of the woods and\r\namong the defiles of the hills for five months, eluding the various\r\nattempts of the king to discover them.\r\n\r\n12. And Sapor, when he saw that he was losing his labour in the middle\r\nof winter, burnt all the fruit trees, and all the fortified castles and\r\ncamps, of which he had become master by force or treachery, and also\r\nburnt Artogerassa, which had long been blockaded by his whole army, and\r\nafter many battles was taken through the exhaustion of the garrison; and\r\nhe carried off from thence the wife of Arsaces and all his treasures.\r\n\r\n13. For these reasons, Arinthæus was sent into these districts with the\r\nrank of count, to aid the Armenians if the Persians should attempt to\r\nharass them by a second campaign.\r\n\r\n14. At the same time, Sapor, with extraordinary cunning, being either\r\nhumble or arrogant as best suited him, under pretence of an intended\r\nalliance, sent secret messengers to Para to reproach him as neglectful\r\nof his own dignity, since, with the appearance of royal majesty, he was\r\nreally the slave of Cylaces and Artabannes. On which Para, with great\r\nprecipitation, cajoled them with caresses till he got them in his power,\r\nand slew them, sending their heads to Sapor in proof of his obedience.\r\n\r\n15. When the death of these men became generally known, it caused such\r\ndismay that Armenia would have been ruined without striking a blow in\r\nits own defence, if the Persians had not been so alarmed at the approach\r\nof Arinthæus that they forbore to invade it again, contenting themselves\r\nwith sending ambassadors to the emperor, demanding of him not to defend\r\nthat nation, according to the agreement made between them and Jovian.\r\n\r\n16. Their ambassadors were rejected, and Sauromaces, who, as we have\r\nsaid before, had been expelled from the kingdom of Hiberia, was sent\r\nback with twelve legions under the command of Terentius; and when he\r\nreached the river Cyrus, Aspacuras entreated him that they might both\r\nreign as partners, being cousins; alleging that he could not withdraw\r\nnor cross over to the side of the Romans, because his son Ultra was as a\r\nhostage in the hands of the Persians.\r\n\r\n17. The emperor learning this, in order by wisdom and prudence to put an\r\nend to the difficulties arising out of this affair, acquiesced in the\r\ndivision of Hiberia, allowing the Cyrus to be the boundary of the two\r\ndivisions: Sauromaces to have the portion next to the Armenians and\r\nLazians, and Aspacuras the districts which border on Albania and Persia.\r\n\r\n18. Sapor, indignant at this, exclaimed that he was unworthily treated,\r\nbecause we had assisted Armenia contrary to our treaty, and because the\r\nembassy had failed which he had sent to procure redress, and because the\r\nkingdom of Hiberia was divided without his consent or privity; and so,\r\nshutting as it were, the gates of friendship, he sought assistance among\r\nthe neighbouring nations, and prepared his own army in order, with the\r\nreturn of fine weather, to overturn all the arrangements which the\r\nRomans had made with a view to their own interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n[160] Cabillonum is Châlons-sur-Soane, in Burgundy; Catalauni is\r\nChâlons-sur-Marne, in Champagne.\r\n\r\n[161] These seem to have been a tribe of the _Batavi_; but some editors\r\ngive, as a various reading, _Hastarii_, which may be translated, a\r\ndetachment of lancers.\r\n\r\n[162] Probably the church of Santa Maria Maggiore; but see note in\r\nGibbon, ch. xxv.

Many persons, even senators and women of senatorial family are\r\n     accused at Rome of poisonings, adultery, and debauchery, and are\r\n     punished.--II. The Emperor Valentinian fortifies the whole Gallic\r\n     bank of the Rhine with forts, castles, and towers; the Allemanni\r\n     slay the Romans who are constructing a fortification on the other\r\n     side of the Rhine.--The Maratocupreni, who are ravaging Syria, are,\r\n     by the command of Valens, destroyed with their children and their\r\n     town.--III.

The ravages\r\n     inflicted in the province of Tripoli, and on the people of Leptis\r\n     and OEa, by the Asturians, are concealed from Valentinian by the\r\n     bad faith of the Roman count; and so are not properly avenged.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nA.D. 368.\r\n\r\n§ 1. While the perfidy of the king was exciting these unexpected\r\ntroubles in Persia, as we have related above, and while war was reviving\r\nin the east, sixteen years and rather more after the death of\r\nNepotianus, Bellona, raging through the eternal city, destroyed\r\neverything, proceeding from trifling beginnings to the most lamentable\r\ndisasters. Would that they could be buried in everlasting silence, lest\r\nperhaps similar things may some day be again attempted, which will do\r\nmore harm by the general example thus set than even by the misery they\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\n2. And although after a careful consideration of different\r\ncircumstances, a reasonable fear would restrain me from giving a minute\r\naccount of the bloody deeds now perpetrated, yet, relying on the\r\nmoderation of the present age, I will briefly touch upon the things\r\nmost deserving of record, nor shall I regret giving a concise account of\r\nthe fears which the events that happened at a former period caused me.\r\n\r\n3. In the first Median war, when the Persians had ravaged Asia, they\r\nlaid siege to Miletus with a vast host, threatening the garrison with\r\ntorture and death, and at last reduced the citizens to such straits,\r\nthat they all, being overwhelmed with the magnitude of their distresses,\r\nslew their nearest relations, cast all their furniture and movables into\r\nthe fire, and then threw themselves in rivalry with one another on the\r\ncommon funeral pile of their perishing country.\r\n\r\n4. A short time afterwards, Phrynichus made this event the subject of a\r\ntragedy which he exhibited on the stage at Athens; and after he had been\r\nfor a short time listened to with complacency, when amid all its fine\r\nlanguage the tragedy became more and more distressing, it was condemned\r\nby the indignation of the people, who thought that it was insulting to\r\nproduce this as the subject of a dramatic poem, and that it had been\r\nprompted not by a wish to console, but only to remind them to their own\r\ndisgrace of the sufferings which that beautiful city had endured without\r\nreceiving any aid from its founder and parent. For Miletus was a colony\r\nof the Athenians, and had been established there among the other Ionian\r\nstates by Neleus, the son of that Codrus who is said to have devoted\r\nhimself for his country in the Dorian war.\r\n\r\n5. Let us now return to our subject. Maximinus, formerly deputy prefect\r\nof Rome, was born in a very obscure rank of life at Sopianæ, a town of\r\nValeria; his father being only a clerk in the president's office,\r\ndescended from the posterity of those Carpi whom Diocletian removed from\r\ntheir ancient homes and transferred to Pannonia.\r\n\r\n6. After a slight study of the liberal sciences, and some small practice\r\nat the bar, he was promoted to be governor of Corsica, then of Sardinia,\r\nand at last of Tuscany. From hence, as his successor loitered a long\r\nwhile on his road, he proceeded to superintend the supplying of the\r\neternal city with provisions, still retaining the government of the\r\nprovince; and three different considerations rendered him cautious on\r\nhis first entrance into office, namely:--\r\n\r\n7. In the first place, because he bore in mind the prediction of his\r\nfather, a man pre-eminently skilful in interpreting what was portended\r\nby birds from whom auguries were taken, or by the note of such birds as\r\nspoke. And he had warned him that though he would rise to supreme\r\nauthority, he would perish by the axe of the executioner; secondly,\r\nbecause he had fallen in with a Sardinian (whom he himself subsequently\r\nput to death by treachery, as report generally affirmed) who was a man\r\nskilled in raising up evil spirits, and in gathering presages from\r\nghosts; and as long as that Sardinian lived, he, fearing to be betrayed,\r\nwas more tractable and mild; lastly, because while he was slowly making\r\nhis way through inferior appointments, like a serpent that glides\r\nunderground, he was not yet of power sufficient to perpetrate any\r\nextensive destruction or executions.\r\n\r\n8. But the origin of his arriving at more extensive power lay in the\r\nfollowing transaction: Chilo, who had been deputy, and his wife, named\r\nMaxima, complained to Olybrius, at that time prefect of the city,\r\nasserting that their lives had been attacked by poison, and with such\r\nearnestness that the men whom they suspected were at once arrested and\r\nthrown into prison. These were Sericus, a musician, Asbolius, a\r\nwrestling master, and Campensis, a soothsayer.\r\n\r\n9. But as the affair began to cool on account of the long-continued\r\nviolence of some illness with which Olybrius was attacked, the persons\r\nwho had laid the complaint, becoming impatient of delay, presented a\r\npetition in which they asked to have the investigation of their charge\r\nreferred to the superintendent of the corn-market; and, from a desire\r\nfor a speedy decision, this request was granted.\r\n\r\n10. Now, therefore, that he had an opportunity of doing injury, Maximin\r\ndisplayed the innate ferocity which was implanted in his cruel heart,\r\njust as wild beasts exhibited in the amphitheatre often do when at\r\nlength released from their cages. And, as this affair was represented\r\nfirst in various ways, as if in a kind of prelude, and some persons with\r\ntheir sides lacerated named certain nobles, as if by means of their\r\nclients and other low-born persons known as criminals and informers,\r\nthey had employed various artifices for injuring them. This infernal\r\ndelegate, carrying his investigations to an extravagant length,\r\npresented a malicious report to the emperor, in which he told him that\r\nsuch atrocious crimes as many people had committed at Rome could not be\r\ninvestigated nor punished without the severest penalties.\r\n\r\n11. When the emperor learnt this he was exasperated beyond measure,\r\nbeing rather a furious than a rigorous enemy to vice; and accordingly,\r\nby one single edict applying to causes of this kind, which in his\r\narrogance he treated as if they partook of treason, he commanded that\r\nall those whom the equity of the ancient law and the judgment of the\r\ngods had exempted from examination by torture, should, if the case\r\nseemed to require it, be put to the rack.\r\n\r\n12. And in order that the authority to be established, by being doubled\r\nand raised to greater distinction, might be able to heap up greater\r\ncalamities, he appointed Maximin proprefect at Rome, and gave him as\r\ncolleague in the prosecution of these inquiries, which were being\r\nprepared for the ruin of many persons, a secretary named Leo, who was\r\nafterwards master of the ceremonies. He was by birth a Pannonian, and by\r\noccupation originally a brigand, as savage as a wild beast, and\r\ninsatiable of human blood.\r\n\r\n13. The accession of a colleague so much like himself, inflamed the\r\ncruel and malignant disposition of Maximin, which was further encouraged\r\nby the commission which conferred this dignity on them; so that,\r\nflinging himself about in his exultation, he seemed rather to dance than\r\nto walk, while he studied to imitate the Brachmans who, according to\r\nsome accounts, move in the air amid the altars.\r\n\r\n14. And now the trumpets of intestine discords sounded, while all men\r\nstood amazed at the atrocity of the things which were done. Among which,\r\nbesides many other cruel and inhuman actions so various and so numerous\r\nthat it is impossible for me to relate them all, the death of Marinus,\r\nthe celebrated advocate, was especially remarkable. He was condemned to\r\ndeath on a charge which was not even attempted to be supported by\r\nevidence, of having endeavoured by wicked acts to compass a marriage\r\nwith Hispanilla.\r\n\r\n15. And since I think that perhaps some persons may read this history\r\nwho, after careful investigation, will object to it that such and such a\r\nthing was done before another; or again that this or that circumstance\r\nhas been omitted, I consider that I have inserted enough, because it is\r\nnot every event which has been brought about by base people that is\r\nworth recording; nor, if it were necessary to relate them all, would\r\nthere be materials for such an account, not even if the public records\r\nthemselves were examined, when so many atrocious deeds were common, and\r\nwhen this new frenzy was throwing everything into confusion without the\r\nslightest restraint; and when what was feared was evidently not a\r\njudicial trial but a total cessation of all justice.\r\n\r\n16. At this time, Cethegus, a senator, who was accused of adultery, was\r\nbeheaded, and a young man of noble birth, named Alypius, who had been\r\nbanished for some trivial misconduct, with some other persons of low\r\ndescent, were all publicly executed; while every one appeared in their\r\nsufferings to see a representation of what they themselves might expect,\r\nand dreamt of nothing but tortures, prisons, and dark dungeons.\r\n\r\n17. At the same time also, the affair of Hymetius, a man of very eminent\r\ncharacter, took place, of which the circumstances were as follows. When\r\nhe was governing Africa as proconsul, and the Carthaginians were in\r\nextreme distress for want of food, he supplied them with corn out of the\r\ngranaries destined for the Roman people; and shortly afterwards, when\r\nthere was a fine harvest, he without delay fully replaced what he had\r\nthus consumed.\r\n\r\n18. But as at the time of the scarcity ten bushels had been sold to\r\nthose who were in want for a piece of gold, while he now bought thirty\r\nfor the same sum, he sent the profit derived from the difference in\r\nprice to the emperor's treasury. Therefore, Valentinian, suspecting that\r\nthere was not as much sent as there ought to have been as the proceeds\r\nof this traffic, confiscated a portion of his property.\r\n\r\n19. And to aggravate the severity of this infliction, another\r\ncircumstance happened about the same time which equally tended to his\r\nruin. Amantius was a soothsayer of pre-eminent celebrity at that period,\r\nand having been accused by some secret informer of being employed by\r\nthis same Hymetius to offer a sacrifice for some evil purpose, he was\r\nbrought before a court of justice and put to the rack; but in spite of\r\nall his tortures, he denied the charge with steadfast resolution.\r\n\r\n20. And as he denied it, some secret papers were brought from his house,\r\namong which was found a letter in the handwriting of Hymetius, in which\r\nhe asked Amantius to propitiate the gods by some solemn sacrifices to\r\nengage them to make the disposition of the emperor favourable to him;\r\nand at the end of the letter were found some reproachful terms applied\r\nto the emperor as avaricious and cruel.\r\n\r\n21. Valentinian learnt these facts from the report of some informers,\r\nwho exaggerated the offence given, and with very unnecessary vigour\r\nordered an inquiry to be made into the affair; and because Frontinus,\r\nthe assessor of Hymetius, was accused of having been the instrument of\r\ndrawing up this letter, he was scourged with rods till he confessed, and\r\nthen he was condemned to exile in Britain. But Amantius was subsequently\r\nconvicted of some capital crimes and was executed.\r\n\r\n22. After these transactions, Hymetius was conducted to the town of\r\nOtricoli, to be examined by Ampelius, the prefect of the city, and\r\ndeputy of Maximin; and when he was on the point of being condemned, as\r\nwas manifest to every one, he judiciously seized an opportunity that was\r\nafforded to him of appealing to the protection of the emperor, and being\r\nprotected by his name, he came off for the time in safety.\r\n\r\n23. The emperor, however, when he was consulted on the matter, remitted\r\nit to the senate, who examined into the whole affair with justice, and\r\nbanished him to Boæ, a village in Dalmatia, for which they were visited\r\nwith the wrath of the emperor, who was exceedingly enraged when he heard\r\nthat a man whom in his own mind he had condemned to death had been let\r\noff with a milder punishment.\r\n\r\n24. These and similar transactions led every one to fear that the\r\ntreatment thus experienced by a few was intended for all: and that these\r\nevils should not, by being concealed, grow greater and greater till they\r\nreached an intolerable height, the nobles sent a deputation consisting\r\nof Prætextatus, formerly a prefect of the city, Venustus, formerly\r\ndeputy, and Minervius, who had been a consular governor, to entreat the\r\nemperor not to allow the punishments to exceed the offences, and not to\r\npermit any senator to be exposed to the torture in an unprecedented and\r\nunlawful manner.\r\n\r\n25. But when these envoys were admitted into the council chamber,\r\nValentinian denied that he had ever given such orders, and insisted that\r\nthe charges made against him were calumnies. He was, however, refuted\r\nwith great moderation by the prætor Eupraxius; and in consequence of\r\nthis freedom, the cruel injunction that had been issued, and which had\r\nsurpassed all previous examples of cruelty, was amended.\r\n\r\n26. About the same time, Lollianus, a youth of tender age, the son of\r\nLampadius, who had been prefect, being accused before Maximin, who\r\ninvestigated his case with great care, and being convicted of having\r\ncopied out a book on the subject of the unlawful acts (though, as his\r\nage made it likely, without any definite plan of using it), was, it\r\nseemed, on the point of being sentenced to banishment, when, at the\r\nsuggestion of his father, he appealed to the emperor; and being by his\r\norder brought to court, it appeared that he had, as the proverb has it,\r\ngone from the frying-pan into the fire, as he was now handed over to\r\nPhalangius, the consular governor of Bætica, and put to death by the\r\nhand of the executioner.\r\n\r\n27. There were also Tarratius Bassus, who afterwards became prefect of\r\nthe city, his brother Camenius, a man of the name of Marcian, and\r\nEusapius, all men of great eminence, who were prosecuted on the ground\r\nof having protected the charioteer Auchenius, and being his accomplices\r\nin the act of poisoning. The evidence was very doubtful, and they were\r\nacquitted by the decision of Victorinus, as general report asserted;\r\nVictorinus being a most intimate friend of Maximin.\r\n\r\n28. Women too were equally exposed to similar treatment. For many of\r\nthis sex also, and of noble birth, were put to death on being convicted\r\nof adultery or unchastity. The most notorious cases were those of\r\nClaritas and Flaviana; the first of whom, when conducted to death, was\r\nstripped of the clothes which she wore, not even being permitted to\r\nretain enough to cover her with bare decency; and for this the\r\nexecutioner also was convicted of having committed a great crime, and\r\nburnt to death.\r\n\r\n29. Paphius and Cornelius, both senators, confessed that they had\r\npolluted themselves by the wicked practice of poisoning, and were put to\r\ndeath by the sentence of Maximin; and by a similar sentence the master\r\nof the mint was executed. He also condemned Sericus and Asbolius, who\r\nhave been mentioned before; and because while exhorting them to name any\r\nothers who occurred to them, he had promised them with an oath that they\r\nshould not themselves be punished either by fire or sword, he had them\r\nslain by violent blows from balls of lead. After this he also burnt\r\nalive Campensis the soothsayer, not having in his case bound himself by\r\nany oath or promise.\r\n\r\n30. Here it is in my opinion convenient to explain the cause which\r\nbrought Aginatius headlong to destruction, a man ennobled by a long race\r\nof ancestors, as unvarying tradition affirms, though no proof of his\r\nancestral renown was ever substantiated.\r\n\r\n31. Maximin, full of pride and arrogance, and being then also prefect of\r\nthe corn-market, and having many encouragements to audacity, proceeded\r\nso far as to show his contempt for Probus, the most illustrious of all\r\nthe nobles, and who was governing the provinces with the authority of\r\nprefect of the prætorium.\r\n\r\n32. Aginatius, being indignant at this, and feeling it a hardship that\r\nin the trial of causes Olybrius had preferred Maximin to himself, while\r\nhe was actually deputy at Rome, secretly informed Probus in private\r\nletters that the arrogant and foolish man who had thus set himself\r\nagainst his lofty merits, might easily be put down if he thought fit.\r\n\r\n33. These letters, as some affirm, Probus sent to Maximin, hardened as\r\nhe was in wickedness, because he feared his influence with the emperor;\r\nletting none but the bearer know the business. And when he had read\r\nthem, the cruel Maximin became furious, and henceforth set all his\r\nengines at work to destroy Aginatius, like a serpent that had been\r\nbruised by some one whom it knew.\r\n\r\n34. There was another still more powerful cause for intriguing against\r\nhim, which ultimately became his destruction. For he charged Victorinus,\r\nwho was dead, and from whom he had received a very considerable legacy,\r\nwith having while alive made money of the decrees of Maximin; and with\r\nsimilar maliciousness he had also threatened his wife Anepsia with a\r\nlawsuit.\r\n\r\n35. Anepsia, alarmed at this, and to support herself by the aid of\r\nMaximin, pretended that her husband in a will which he had recently\r\nmade, had left him three thousand pounds weight of silver. He, full of\r\ncovetousness, for this too was one of his vices, demanded half the\r\ninheritance, and afterwards, not being contented with that, as if it\r\nwere hardly sufficient, he contrived another device which he looked upon\r\nas both honourable and safe; and not to lose his hold of the handle thus\r\nput in his way for obtaining a large estate, he demanded the daughter of\r\nAnepsia, who was the stepdaughter of Victorinus, as a wife for his son;\r\nand this marriage was quickly arranged with the consent of the woman.\r\n\r\n36. Through these and other atrocities equally lamentable, which threw a\r\ngloom over the whole of the eternal city, this man, never to be named\r\nwithout a groan, grew by the ruin of numerous other persons, and began\r\nto stretch out his hands beyond the limits of lawsuits and trials: for\r\nit is said that he had a small cord always suspended from a remote\r\nwindow of the prætorium, the end of which had a loop which was easily\r\ndrawn tight, by means of which he received secret informations supported\r\nby no evidence or testimony, but capable of being used to the ruin of\r\nmany innocent persons. And he used often to send his officers, Mucianus\r\nand Barbarus, men fit for any deceit or treachery, secretly out of his\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n37. Who then, as if bewailing some hardship which as they pretended had\r\nfallen upon them, and exaggerating the cruelty of the judge, with\r\nconstant repetition assured those who really lay under execution that\r\nthere was no remedy by which they could save themselves except that of\r\nadvancing heavy accusation against men of high rank; because if such\r\nmen were involved in such accusations, they themselves would easily\r\nprocure an acquittal.\r\n\r\n38. In this way, Maximin's implacable temper overwhelmed those yet in\r\nhis power; numbers were thrown into prison, and persons of the highest\r\nrank were seen with anxious faces and in mourning attire. Nor ought any\r\none of them to be blamed for bowing down to the ground in saluting this\r\nmonster, when they heard him vociferating with the tone of a wild beast,\r\nthat no one could ever be acquitted unless he choose.\r\n\r\n39. For sayings like that, when instantly followed by their natural\r\nresult, would have terrified even men like Numa, Pompilius, or Cato. In\r\nfact things went on in such a way that some persons never had their eyes\r\ndried of the tears caused by the misfortunes of others, as often happens\r\nin such unsettled and dangerous times.\r\n\r\n40. And the iron-hearted judge, continually disregarding all law and\r\njustice, had but one thing about him which made him endurable; for\r\nsometimes he was prevailed upon by entreaties to spare some one, though\r\nthis too is affirmed to be nearly a vice in the following passage of\r\nCicero. \"If anger be implacable, it is the extreme of severity; if it\r\nyield to entreaties, it is the extreme of levity; though in times of\r\nmisfortune even levity is to be preferred to cruelty.\"\r\n\r\n41. After these events, Leo arrived, and was received as his successor,\r\nand Maximin was summoned to the emperor's court and promoted to the\r\noffice of prefect of the prætorium, where he was as cruel as ever,\r\nhaving indeed greater power of inflicting injury, like a basilisk\r\nserpent.\r\n\r\n42. Just at this time, or not long before, the brooms with which the\r\nsenate-house of the nobles was swept out were seen to flower, and this\r\nportended that some persons of the very lowest class would be raised to\r\nhigh rank and power.\r\n\r\n43. Though it is now time to return to the course of our regular\r\nhistory, yet without neglecting the proper order of time, we must dwell\r\non a few incidents, which through the iniquity of the deputy prefects of\r\nthe city, were done most unjustly, being in fact done at the word and\r\nwill of Maximin by those same officers, who seemed to look on themselves\r\nas the mere servants of his pleasure.\r\n\r\n44. After him came Ursicinus, a man of a more merciful disposition,\r\nwho, wishing to act cautiously and in conformity to the constitution,\r\nconfronted a man named Esaias with some others who were in prison on a\r\ncharge of adultery with Rufina; who had attempted to establish a charge\r\nof treason against Marcellus her husband, formerly in a situation of\r\nhigh trust. But this act led to his being despised as a dawdler, and a\r\nperson little fit to carry out such designs with proper resolution, and\r\nso he was removed from his place of deputy.\r\n\r\n45. He was succeeded by Simplicius of Emona, who had been a\r\nschoolmaster, but was now the assessor of Maximin. After receiving this\r\nappointment, he did not grow more proud or arrogant, but assumed a\r\nsupercilious look, which gave a repulsive expression to his countenance.\r\nHis language was studiously moderate, while he meditated the most\r\nrigorous proceedings against many persons. And first of all he put\r\nRufina to death with all the partners of her adultery, and all who were\r\nprivy to it, concerning whom Ursicinus, as we have related, had already\r\nmade a report. Then he put numbers of others to death, without any\r\ndistinction between the innocent and the guilty.\r\n\r\n46. Running a race of bloodshed with Maximin, as if he had, as it were,\r\nbeen his leader, he sought to surpass him in destroying the noblest\r\nfamilies, imitating Busiris and Antæus of old, and Phalaris, so that he\r\nseemed to want nothing but the bull of Agrigentum.\r\n\r\n47. After these and other similar transactions had taken place, a\r\ncertain matron named Hesychia, who was accused of having attempted some\r\ncrime, becoming greatly alarmed, and being of a fierce and resolute\r\ndisposition, killed herself in the house of the officer to whom she was\r\ngiven in custody, by muffling her face in a bed of feathers, and\r\nstopping up her nostrils and so becoming suffocated.\r\n\r\n48. To all these calamities another of no less severity was added. For\r\nEumenius and Abienus, two men of the highest class, having been accused,\r\nduring Maximin's term of office, of adultery with Fausiana, a woman of\r\nrank, after the death of Victorinus, under whose protection they were\r\nsafe, being alarmed at the arrival of Simplicius, who was as full of\r\naudacity and threats as Maximin, withdrew to some secret hiding place.\r\n\r\n49. But after Fausiana had been condemned they were recorded among the\r\naccused, and were summoned by public edict to appear, but they only hid\r\nthemselves the more carefully. And Abrenus was for a very long time\r\nconcealed in the house of Anepsia. But as it continually happens that\r\nunexpected accidents come to aggravate the distresses of those who are\r\nalready miserable, a slave of Anepsia named Apaudulus, being angry\r\nbecause his wife had been flogged, went by night to Simplicius, and gave\r\ninformation of the whole affair, and officers were sent to drag them\r\nboth from their place of concealment.\r\n\r\n50. The charge against Abrenus was strengthened by another charge which\r\nwas brought against him, of having seduced Anepsia, and he was condemned\r\nto death. But Anepsia herself, to get some hope of saving her life by at\r\nleast procuring the delay of her execution, affirmed that she had been\r\nassailed by unlawful arts, and had been ravished in the house of\r\nAginatius.\r\n\r\n51. Simplicius with loud indignation reported to the emperor all that\r\nhad taken place, and as Maximin, who was now at court, hated Aginatius\r\nfor the reason which we have already explained, and having his rage\r\nincreased against him at the same time that his power was augmented,\r\nentreated with great urgency that he might be sentenced to death; and\r\nsuch a favour was readily granted to this furious and influential\r\nexciter of the emperor's severity.\r\n\r\n52. Then fearing the exceeding unpopularity which would fall upon him if\r\na man of patrician family should perish by the sentence of Simplicius,\r\nwho was his new assessor and friend, he kept the imperial edict for the\r\nexecution by him for a short time, wavering and doubting whom to pitch\r\nupon as a trusty and efficient perpetrator of so atrocious a deed.\r\n\r\n53. At length, as like usually finds like, a certain Gaul of the name of\r\nDoryphorianus was discovered, a man daring even to madness; and as he\r\npromised to accomplish the matter in a short time, he obtained for him\r\nthe post of deputy, and gave him the emperor's letter with an additional\r\nrescript; instructing the man, who though savage had no experience in\r\nsuch matters, how, if he used sufficient speed, he would meet with no\r\nobstacle to his slaying Aginatius; though, if there were any delay, he\r\nwould be very likely to escape.\r\n\r\n54. Doryphorianus, as he was commanded, hastened to Rome by rapid\r\njourneys; and while beginning to discharge the duties of his new office,\r\nhe exerted great industry to discover how he could put a senator of\r\neminent family to death without any assistance. And when he learnt that\r\nhe had been some time before found in his own house where he was still\r\nkept in custody, he determined to have him brought before him as the\r\nchief of all the criminals, with Anepsia, in the middle of the night; an\r\nhour at which men's minds are especially apt to be bewildered by terror;\r\nas, among many other instances, the Ajax of Homer[165] shows us, when he\r\nexpresses a wish rather to die by daylight, than to suffer the\r\nadditional terrors of the night.\r\n\r\n55. And as the judge, I should rather call him the infamous robber,\r\nintent only on the service he had promised to perform, carried\r\neverything to excess, having ordered Aginatius to be brought in, he also\r\ncommanded the introduction of a troop of executioners; and while the\r\nchains rattled with a mournful sound, he tortured the slaves who were\r\nalready exhausted by their long confinement, till they died, in order to\r\nextract from them matter affecting the life of their master; a\r\nproceeding which in a trial for adultery our merciful laws expressly\r\nforbids.\r\n\r\n56. At last, when the tortures which were all but mortal had wrung some\r\nhints from the maid-servant, without any careful examination of the\r\ntruth of her words, Aginatius was at once sentenced to be led to\r\nexecution, and without being allowed to say a word in his defence,\r\nthough with loud outcries he appealed to and invoked the names of the\r\nemperors, he was carried off and put to death, and Anepsia was executed\r\nby a similar sentence. The eternal city was filled with mourning for\r\nthese executions which were perpetrated either by Maximin himself when\r\nhe was present in the city, or by his emissaries when he was at a\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\n57. But the avenging Furies of those who had been murdered were\r\npreparing retribution. For, as I will afterwards relate at the proper\r\nseason, this same Maximin giving way to his intolerable pride when\r\nGratian was emperor, was put to death by the sword of the executioner;\r\nand Simplicius also was beheaded in Illyricum. Doryphorianus too was\r\ncondemned to death, and thrown into the Tullian prison, but was taken\r\nfrom thence by the emperor at his mother's suggestion, and when he was\r\nbrought back to his own country was put to death with terrible torments.\r\nLet us now return to the point at which we left our history. Such,\r\nhowever, was the state of affairs in the city of Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nA.D. 369.\r\n\r\n§ 1. Valentinian having several great and useful projects in his head,\r\nbegan to fortify the entire banks of the Rhine, from its beginning in\r\nthe Tyrol to the straits of the ocean,[166] with vast works; raising\r\nlofty castles and fortresses, and a perfect range of towers in every\r\nsuitable place, so as to protect the whole frontier of Gaul; and\r\nsometimes, by constructing works on the other side of the river, he\r\nalmost trenched upon the territories of the enemy.\r\n\r\n2. At last considering that one fortress, of which he himself had laid\r\nthe very foundations, though sufficiently high and safe, yet, being\r\nbuilt on the very edge of the river Neckar, was liable to be gradually\r\nundermined by the violent beating of its waters, he formed a plan to\r\ndivert the river itself into another channel; and, having sought out\r\nsome workmen who were skilful in such works and collected a strong\r\nmilitary force, he began that arduous labour.\r\n\r\n3. Day after day large masses of oaken beams were fastened together, and\r\nthrown into the channel, and by them huge piles were continually fixed\r\nand unfixed, being all thrown into disorder by the rising of the stream,\r\nand afterwards they were broken and carried away by the current.\r\n\r\n4. However, the resolute diligence of the emperor and the labour of the\r\nobedient soldiery prevailed; though the troops were often up to their\r\nchins in the water while at work; and at last, though not without\r\nconsiderable risk, the fixed camp was protected against all danger from\r\nthe violence of the current, and is still safe and strong.\r\n\r\n5. Joyful and exulting in this success, the emperor, perceiving that the\r\nweather and the season of the year did not allow him any other\r\noccupation, like a good and active prince began to apply his attention\r\nto the general affairs of the republic. And thinking the time very\r\nproper for completing one work which he had been meditating, he began\r\nwith all speed to raise a fortification on the other side of the Rhine,\r\non Mount Piri, a spot which belongs to the barbarians. And as rapidity\r\nof action was one great means of executing this design with safety, he\r\nsent orders to the Duke Arator, through Syagrius, who was then a\r\nsecretary, but who afterwards became prefect and consul, to attempt to\r\nmake himself master of this height in the dead of the night.\r\n\r\n6. The duke at once crossed over with the secretary, as he was\r\ncommanded; and was beginning to employ the soldiers whom he had brought\r\nwith him to dig out the foundations, when he received a successor,\r\nHermogenes. At the very same moment there arrived some nobles of the\r\nAllemanni, fathers of the hostages, whom, in accordance with our treaty,\r\nwe were detaining as important pledges for the long continuance of the\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n7. And they, with bended knees entreated him not to let the Romans, with\r\nan improvident disregard of all safety (they whose fortune their\r\neverlasting good faith had raised to the skies), now be misled by a base\r\nerror to trample all former agreements under foot, and attempt an act\r\nunworthy of them.\r\n\r\n8. But since it was to no purpose that they used these and similar\r\narguments, as they were not listened to, and finding that they had no\r\nchance of a conciliatory answer, they reluctantly returned, bewailing\r\nthe loss of their sons; and when they were gone, from a secret\r\nhiding-place in a neighbouring hill a troop of barbarians sprang forth,\r\nwaiting, as far as was understood, for the answer which was to be given\r\nto the nobles; and attacking our half-naked soldiers, who were carrying\r\nloads of earth, drew their swords and quickly slew them, and with them\r\nthe two generals.\r\n\r\n9. Nor was any one left to relate what had happened, except Syagrius,\r\nwho, after they were all destroyed returned to the court, where by the\r\nsentence of his offended emperor he was dismissed the service; on which\r\nhe retired to his own home; being judged by the severe decision of the\r\nprince to have deserved this sentence because he was the only one who\r\nescaped.\r\n\r\n10. Meanwhile the wicked fury of bands of robbers raged through Gaul to\r\nthe injury of many persons; since they occupied the most frequented\r\nroads, and without any hesitation seized upon everything valuable which\r\ncame in their way. Besides many other persons who were the victims of\r\nthese treacherous attacks, Constantianus, the tribune of the stable, was\r\nattacked by a secret ambuscade and slain; he was a relation of\r\nValentinian, and the brother of Cerealis and Justina.\r\n\r\n11. In other countries, as if the Furies were stirring up similar evils\r\nto afflict us on every side, the Maratocupreni, those most cruel\r\nbanditti, spread their ravages in every direction. They were the natives\r\nof a town of the same name in Syria, near Apamea; very numerous,\r\nmarvellously skilful in every kind of deceit, and an object of universal\r\nfear, because, under the character of merchants or soldiers of high\r\nrank, they spread themselves quietly over the country, and then pillaged\r\nall the wealthy houses, villages, and towns which came in their way.\r\n\r\n12. Nor could any one guard against their unexpected attacks; since they\r\nfell not upon any previously selected victim, but in places in various\r\nparts, and at great distances, and carried their devastations wherever\r\nthe wind led them. For which reason the Saxons were feared beyond all\r\nother enemies, because of the suddenness of their attacks. They then,\r\nin bands of sworn comrades, destroyed the riches of many persons; and\r\nbeing under the impulse of absolute fury, they committed the most\r\nmournful slaughters, being not less greedy of blood than of booty.\r\nNevertheless, that I may not, by entering into too minute details,\r\nimpede the progress of my history, it will be sufficient to relate one\r\ndestructive device of theirs.\r\n\r\n13. A body of these wicked men assembled in one place, pretending to be\r\nthe retinue of a receiver of the revenue, or of the governor of the\r\nprovince. In the darkness of the evening they entered the city, while\r\nthe crier made a mournful proclamation, and attacked with swords the\r\nhouse of one of the nobles, as if he had been proscribed and sentenced\r\nto death. They seized all his valuable furniture, because his servants,\r\nbeing utterly bewildered by the suddenness of the danger, did not defend\r\nthe house; they slew several of them, and then before the return of\r\ndaylight withdrew with great speed.\r\n\r\n14. But being loaded with a great quantity of plunder, since from their\r\nlove of booty they had left nothing behind, they were intercepted by a\r\nmovement of the emperor's troop, and were cut off and all slain to a\r\nman. And their children, who were at the time very young, were also\r\ndestroyed to prevent their growing up in the likeness of their fathers;\r\nand their houses which they had built with great splendour at the\r\nexpense of the misery of others, were all pulled down. These things\r\nhappened in the order in which they have been related.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. But Theodosius, a general of very famous reputation, departed in\r\nhigh spirits from Augusta, which the ancients used to call Londinium,\r\nwith an army which he had collected with great energy and skill;\r\nbringing a mighty aid to the embarrassed and disturbed fortunes of the\r\nBritons. His plan was to seek everywhere favourable situations for\r\nlaying ambuscades for the barbarians; and to impose no duties on his\r\ntroops of the performance of which he did not himself cheerfully set the\r\nexample.\r\n\r\n2. And in this way, while he performed the duties of a gallant soldier,\r\nand showed at the same time the prudence of an illustrious general, he\r\nrouted and vanquished the various tribes in whom their past security had\r\nengendered an insolence which led them to attack the Roman territories;\r\nand he entirely restored the cities and the fortresses which through the\r\nmanifold disasters of the time had been injured or destroyed, though\r\nthey had been originally founded to secure the tranquillity of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n3. But while he was pursuing this career, a great crime was planned\r\nwhich was likely to have resulted in serious danger, if it had not been\r\ncrushed at the very beginning.\r\n\r\n4. A certain man named Valentine, in Valeria of Pannonia, a man of a\r\nproud spirit, the brother-in-law of Maximin, that wicked and cruel\r\ndeputy, who afterwards became prefect, having been banished to Britain\r\nfor some grave crime, and being a restless and mischievous beast, was\r\neager for any kind of revolution or mischief, began to plot with great\r\ninsolence against Theodosius, whom he looked upon as the only person\r\nwith power to resist his wicked enterprise.\r\n\r\n5. But while both openly and privily taking many precautions, as his\r\npride and covetousness increased, he began to tamper with the exiles and\r\nthe soldiers, promising them rewards sufficient to tempt them as far at\r\nleast as the circumstances and his enterprise would permit.\r\n\r\n6. But when the time for putting his attempt into execution drew near,\r\nthe duke, who had received from some trustworthy quarter information of\r\nwhat was going on, being always a man inclined to a bold line of\r\nconduct, and resolutely bent on chastising crimes when detected, seized\r\nValentine with a few of his accomplices who were most deeply implicated,\r\nand handed them over to the general Dulcitius to be put to death. But at\r\nthe same time conjecturing the future, through that knowledge of the\r\nsoldiers in which he surpassed other men, he forbade the institution of\r\nany examination into the conspiracy generally, lest if the fear of such\r\nan investigation should affect many, fresh troubles might revive in the\r\nprovince.\r\n\r\n7. After this he turned his attention to make many necessary amendments,\r\nfeeling wholly free from any danger in such attempts, since it was plain\r\nthat all his enterprises were attended by a propitious fortune. So he\r\nrestored cities and fortresses, as we have already mentioned, and\r\nestablished stations and outposts on our frontiers; and he so completely\r\nrecovered the province which had yielded subjection to the enemy, that\r\nthrough his agency it was again brought under the authority of its\r\nlegitimate ruler, and from that time forth was called Valentia, by\r\ndesire of the emperor, as a memorial of his success.\r\n\r\n8. The Areans, a class of men instituted in former times, and of whom we\r\nhave already made some mention in recording the acts of Constans, had\r\nnow gradually fallen into bad practices, for which he removed them from\r\ntheir stations; in fact they had been undeniably convicted of yielding\r\nto the temptation of the great rewards which were given and promised to\r\nthem, so as to have continually betrayed to the barbarians what was done\r\namong us. For their business was to traverse vast districts, and report\r\nto our generals the warlike movements of the neighbouring nations.\r\n\r\n9. In this manner the affairs which I have already mentioned, and others\r\nlike them, having been settled, he was summoned to the court, and\r\nleaving the provinces in a state of exultation, like another Furius\r\nCamillus or Papirius Cursor, he was celebrated everywhere for his\r\nnumerous and important victories. He was accompanied by a large crowd of\r\nwell-wishers to the coast, and crossing over with a fair wind, arrived\r\nat the emperor's camp, where he was received with joy and high praise,\r\nand appointed to succeed Valens Jovinus, who was commander of the\r\ncavalry.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n§ 1. I have thus made a long and extensive digression from the affairs\r\nof the city, being constrained by the abundance of events which took\r\nplace abroad; and now I will return to give a cursory sketch of them,\r\nbeginning with the tranquil and moderate exercise of the prefect's\r\nauthority by Olybrius, who never forgot the rights of humanity, but was\r\ncontinually anxious and careful that no word or deed of his should ever\r\nbe harsh or cruel. He was a merciless punisher of calumnies; he\r\nrestrained the exactions of the treasury wherever he could; he was a\r\ncareful discriminator of right and wrong; an equitable judge, and very\r\ngentle towards those placed under his authority.\r\n\r\n2. But all these good qualities were clouded by one vice which, though\r\nnot injurious to the commonwealth, was very discreditable to a judge of\r\nhigh rank; namely, that his private life was one of great luxury,\r\ndevoted to theatrical exhibitions, and to amours, though not such as\r\nwere either infamous or incestuous.\r\n\r\n3. After him Ampelius succeeded to the government of the city; he also\r\nwas a man addicted to pleasure, a native of Antioch, and one who from\r\nhaving been master of the offices was twice promoted to a proconsulship,\r\nand sometime afterwards to that supreme rank, the prefecture. In other\r\nrespects he was a cheerful man, and one admirably suited to win the\r\nfavour of the people; though sometimes over-severe, without being as\r\nfirm in his purposes as might have been wished. Had he been, he would\r\nhave corrected, though perhaps not effectually, the gluttonous and\r\ndebauched habits which prevailed; but, as it was, by his laxity of\r\nconduct, he lost a glory which otherwise might have been enduring.\r\n\r\n4. For he had determined that no wine-shop should be opened before the\r\nfourth hour of the day; and that none of the common people, before a\r\ncertain fixed hour, should either warm water or expose dressed meat for\r\nsale; and that no one of respectable rank should be seen eating in\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n5. Since these unseemly practices, and others still worse, owing to long\r\nneglect and connivance, had grown so frequent that even Epimenides of\r\nCrete, if, according to the fabulous story, he could have risen from the\r\ndead and returned to our times, would have been unable by himself to\r\npurify Rome; such deep stains of incurable vices overwhelmed it.\r\n\r\n6. And in the first place we will speak of the faults of the nobles, as\r\nwe have already repeatedly done as far as our space permitted; and then\r\nwe will proceed to the faults of the common people, touching, however,\r\nonly briefly and rapidly on either.\r\n\r\n7. Some men, conspicuous for the illustriousness of their ancestry as\r\nthey think, gave themselves immoderate airs, and call themselves\r\nReburri, and Fabunii, and Pagonii, and Geriones, Dalii, Tarracii, or\r\nPerrasii, and other finely-sounding appellations, indicating the\r\nantiquity of their family.\r\n\r\n8. Some also are magnificent in silken robes, as if they were being led\r\nto execution, or, to speak without words of so unfavourable an omen, as\r\nif after the army had passed they were bringing up the rear, and are\r\nfollowed by a vast troop of servants, with a din like that of a company\r\nof soldiers.\r\n\r\n9. Such men when, while followed by fifty servants apiece, they have\r\nentered the baths, cry out with threatening voice, \"Where are my\r\npeople?\" And if they suddenly find out that any unknown female slave has\r\nappeared, or any worn-out courtesan who has long been subservient to the\r\npleasures of the townspeople, they run up, as if to win a race, and\r\npatting and caressing her with disgusting and unseemly blandishments,\r\nthey extol her, as the Parthians might praise Semiramis, Egypt her\r\nCleopatra, the Carians Artemisia, or the Palmyrene citizens Zenobia. And\r\nmen do this, whose ancestor, even though a senator, would have been\r\nbranded with a mark of infamy because he dared, at an unbecoming time,\r\nto kiss his wife in the presence of their common daughter.\r\n\r\n10. Some of these, when any one meets and begins to salute them, toss\r\ntheir heads like bulls preparing to butt, offering their flatterers\r\ntheir knees or hands to kiss, thinking that quite enough for their\r\nperfect happiness; while they deem it sufficient attention and civility\r\nto a stranger who may happen to have laid them under some obligation to\r\nask him what warm or cold bath he frequents, or what house he lives in.\r\n\r\n11. And while they are so solemn, looking upon themselves as especial\r\ncultivators of virtue, if they learn that any one has brought\r\nintelligence that any fine horses or skilful coachmen are coming from\r\nany place, they rush with as much haste to see them, examine them, and\r\nput questions concerning them, as their ancestors showed on beholding\r\nthe twin-brothers Tyndaridæ,[167] when they filled the whole city with\r\njoy by the announcement of that ancient victory.\r\n\r\n12. A number of idle chatterers frequent their houses, and, with various\r\npretended modes of adulation, applaud every word uttered by men of such\r\nhigh fortune; resembling the parasites in a comedy, for as they puff up\r\nbragging soldiers, attributing to them, as rivals of the heroes of old,\r\nsieges of cities, and battles, and the death of thousands of enemies, so\r\nthese men admire the construction of the lofty pillars, and the walls\r\ninlaid with stones of carefully chosen colours, and extol these grandees\r\nwith superhuman praises.\r\n\r\n13. Sometimes scales are sent for at their entertainments to weigh the\r\nfish, or the birds, or the dormice which are set on the table; and then\r\nthe size of them is dwelt on over and over again, to the great weariness\r\nof those present, as something never seen before; especially when near\r\nthirty secretaries stand by, with tablets and memorandum books, to\r\nrecord all these circumstances; so that nothing seems to be wanting but\r\na schoolmaster.\r\n\r\n14. Some of them, hating learning as they hate poison, read Juvenal and\r\nMarius Maximus[168] with tolerably careful study; though, in their\r\nprofound laziness, they never touch any other volumes; why, it does not\r\nbelong to my poor judgment to decide.\r\n\r\n15. For, in consideration of their great glories and long pedigrees,\r\nthey ought to read a great variety of books; in which, for instance,\r\nthey might learn that Socrates, when condemned to death and thrown into\r\nprison, asked some one who was playing a song of the Greek poet\r\nStesichorus with great skill, to teach him also to do that, while it was\r\nstill in his power; and when the musician asked him of what use this\r\nskill could be to him, as he was to die the next day, he answered, \"that\r\nI may know something more before I die.\"\r\n\r\n16. And there are among them some who are such severe judges of\r\noffences, that if a slave is too long in bringing them hot water, they\r\nwill order him to be scourged with three hundred stripes; but should he\r\nintentionally have killed a man, while numbers insist that he ought to\r\nbe unhesitatingly condemned as guilty, his master will exclaim, \"What\r\ncan the poor wretch do? what can one expect from a good-for-nothing\r\nfellow like that?\" But should any one else venture to do anything of the\r\nkind, he would be corrected.\r\n\r\n17. Their ideas of civility are such that a stranger had better kill a\r\nman's brother than send an excuse to them if he be asked to dinner; for\r\na senator fancies that he has suffered a terrible grievance, equal to\r\nthe loss of his entire patrimony, if any guest be absent, whom, after\r\nrepeated deliberations, he has once invited.\r\n\r\n18. Some of them, if they have gone any distance to see their estates in\r\nthe country, or to hunt at a meeting collected for their amusement by\r\nothers, think they have equalled the marches of Alexander the Great, or\r\nof Cæsar; or if they have gone in some painted boats from Lake Avernus\r\nto Pozzuoli or Cajeta, especially if they have ventured on such an\r\nexploit in warm weather. Where if, amid their golden fans, a fly should\r\nperch on the silken fringes, or if a slender ray of the sun should have\r\npierced through a hole in their awning, they complain that they were not\r\nborn among the Cimmerians.\r\n\r\n19. Then, when they come from the bath of Silvanus, or the waters of\r\nMamæa, which are so good for the health, after they come out of the\r\nwater, and have wiped themselves with cloths of the finest linen, they\r\nopen the presses, and take out of them robes so delicate as to be\r\ntransparent, selecting them with care, till they have got enough to\r\nclothe eleven persons; and at length, after they have picked out all\r\nthey choose, they wrap themselves up in them, and take the rings which\r\nthey had given to their attendants to hold, that they might not be\r\ninjured by the damp; and then they depart when their fingers are\r\nproperly cooled.\r\n\r\n20. Again, if any one having lately quitted the military service of the\r\nemperor, has retired to his home.[169] ...\r\n\r\n21. Some of them, though not many, wish to avoid the name of gamblers,\r\nand prefer to be called dice-players; the difference being much the same\r\nas that between a thief and a robber. But this must be confessed that,\r\nwhile all friendships at Rome are rather cool, those alone which are\r\nengendered by dice are sociable and intimate, as if they had been formed\r\namid glorious exertions, and were firmly cemented by exceeding\r\naffection; to which it is owing that some of this class of gamblers live\r\nin such harmony that you might think them the brothers Quintilii.[170]\r\nAnd so you may sometimes see a man of base extraction, who knows all the\r\nsecrets of the dice, as grave as Porcius Cato when he met with a repulse\r\nwhich he had never expected nor dreamt of, when a candidate for the\r\nprætorship, with affected solemnity and a serious face, because at some\r\ngrand entertainment or assembly some man of proconsular rank has been\r\npreferred to himself.\r\n\r\n22. Some lay siege to wealthy men, whether old or young, childless or\r\nunmarried, or even with wives and children (for with such an object no\r\ndistinction is ever regarded by them), seeking by most marvellous tricks\r\nto allure them to make their wills; and then if, after observing all the\r\nforms of law, they bequeath to these persons what they have to leave,\r\nbeing won over by them to this compliance, they speedily die.[171]\r\n\r\n23. Another person, perhaps only in some subordinate office, struts\r\nalong with his head up, looking with so slight and passing a glance upon\r\nthose with whom he was previously acquainted, that you might fancy it\r\nmust be Marcus Marcellus just returned from the capture of Syracuse.\r\n\r\n24. Many among them deny the existence of a superior Power in heaven,\r\nand yet neither appear in public, nor dine, nor think that they can\r\nbathe with any prudence, before they have carefully consulted an\r\nalmanac, and learnt where (for example) the planet Mercury is, or in\r\nwhat portion of Cancer the moon is as she passes through the heavens.\r\n\r\n25. Another man, if he perceives his creditor to be importunate in\r\ndemanding a debt, flies to a charioteer who is bold enough to venture on\r\nany audacious enterprise, and takes care that he shall be harassed with\r\ndread of persecution as a poisoner; from which he cannot be released\r\nwithout giving bail and incurring a very heavy expense. One may add to\r\nthis, that he includes under this head a debtor who is only so through\r\nthe engagements into which he has entered to avoid a prosecution, as if\r\nhe were a real debtor, and that he never lets him go till he has\r\nobtained the discharge of the debt.\r\n\r\n26. On the other side, a wife, who, as the old proverb has it, hammers\r\non the same anvil day and night, to compel her husband to make his will,\r\nand then the husband is equally urgent that his wife shall do the same.\r\nAnd men learned in the law are procured on each side, the one in the\r\nbedchamber, and his opponent in the dining-room, to draw up\r\ncounter-documents. And under their employ are placed ambiguous\r\ninterpreters of the contracts of their victims, who, on the one side,\r\npromise with great liberality high offices, and the funerals of wealthy\r\nmatrons; and from these they proceed to the obsequies of the husbands,\r\ngiving hints that everything necessary ought to be prepared; and[172]\r\n... as Cicero says, \"Nor in the affairs of men do they understand\r\nanything good, except what is profitable; and they love those friends\r\nmost (as they would prefer sheep) from whom they expect to derive the\r\ngreatest advantage.\"[173]\r\n\r\n27. And when they borrow anything, they are so humble and cringing, you\r\nwould think you were at a comedy, and seeing Micon or Laches; when they\r\nare constrained to repay what they have borrowed, they become so turgid\r\nand bombastic that you would take them for those descendants of\r\nHercules, Cresphontes and Temenus. This is enough to say of the\r\nsenatorial order.\r\n\r\n28. And let us come to the idle and lazy common people, among whom some,\r\nwho have not even got shoes boast of high-sounding names; calling\r\nthemselves Cimessores, Statarii, Semicupæ, Serapina, or Cicimbricus, or\r\nGluturiorus, Trulla, Lucanicus, Pordaca, or Salsula,[174] with numbers\r\nof other similar appellations. These men spend their whole lives in\r\ndrinking, and gambling, and brothels, and pleasures, and public\r\nspectacles; and to them the Circus Maximus is their temple, their home,\r\ntheir public assembly; in fact, their whole hope and desire.[175]\r\n\r\n29. And you may see in the forum, and roads, and streets, and places of\r\nmeeting, knots of people collected, quarrelling violently with one\r\nanother, and objecting to one another, and splitting themselves into\r\nviolent parties.\r\n\r\n30. Among whom those who have lived long, having influence by reason of\r\ntheir age, their gray hairs and wrinkles, are continually crying out\r\nthat the republic cannot stand, if in the contest which is about to take\r\nplace, the skilful charioteer, whom some individual backs, is not\r\nforemost in the race, and does not dextrously shave the turning-post\r\nwith the trace-horses.\r\n\r\n31. And when there is so much ruinous carelessness, when the wished-for\r\nday of the equestrian games dawns, before the sun has visibly risen,\r\nthey all rush out with headlong haste, as if with their speed they would\r\noutstrip the very chariots which are going to race; while as to the\r\nevent of the contest they are all torn asunder by opposite wishes, and\r\nthe greater part of them, through their anxiety, pass sleepless nights.\r\n\r\n32. From hence, if you go to some cheap theatre, the actors on the stage\r\nare driven off by hisses, if they have not taken the precaution to\r\nconciliate the lowest of the people by gifts of money. And if there\r\nshould be no noise, then, in imitation of the people in the Tauric\r\nChersonese, they raise an outcry that the strangers ought to be expelled\r\n(on whose assistance they have always relied for their principal\r\nsupport), using foul and ridiculous expressions; such as are greatly at\r\nvariance with the pursuits and inclinations of that populace of old,\r\nwhose many facetious and elegant expressions are recorded by tradition\r\nand by history.\r\n\r\n33. For these clever gentlemen have now devised a new method of\r\nexpressing applause, which is, at every spectacle to cry out to those\r\nwho appear at the end, whether they are couriers, huntsmen, or\r\ncharioteers--in short, to the whole body of actors, and to the\r\nmagistrates, whether of great or small importance, and even to nations,\r\n\"It is to your school that he ought to go.\" But what he is to learn\r\nthere no one can explain.\r\n\r\n34. Among these men are many chiefly addicted to fattening themselves up\r\nby gluttony, who, following the scent of any delicate food, and the\r\nshrill voices of the women who, from cockcrow, cry out with a shrill\r\nscream, like so many peacocks, and gliding over the ground on tiptoe,\r\nget an entrance into the halls, biting their nails while the dishes are\r\ngetting cool. Others fix their eyes intently on the tainted meat which\r\nis being cooked, that you might fancy Democritus, with a number of\r\nanatomists, was gazing into the entrails of sacrificed victims, in order\r\nto teach posterity how best to relieve internal pains.\r\n\r\n35. For the present this is enough to say of the affairs of the city;\r\nnow let us return to other events which various circumstances brought to\r\npass in the provinces.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n§ 1. In the third consulship of the emperors a vast multitude of Saxons\r\nburst forth, and having crossed the difficult passage of the ocean, made\r\ntowards the Roman frontier by rapid marches, having before often\r\nbattened on the slaughter of our men. The first storm of this invasion\r\nfell upon the count Nannenus, who was in command in that district, being\r\na veteran general of great merit and experience.\r\n\r\n2. He now engaged in battle with a host which fought as if resolved on\r\ndeath; but when he found that he had lost many of his men, and that he\r\nhimself, having been wounded, would be unequal to a succession of\r\nbattles, he sent word to the emperor of what was necessary, and\r\nprevailed on him to send Severus, the commander of the infantry, to aid\r\nhim at this crisis.\r\n\r\n3. That general brought with him a sufficient body of troops, and when\r\nhe arrived in the country he so arrayed his men that he terrified the\r\nbarbarians, and threw them into such disorder, even before any battle\r\ntook place, that they did not venture to engage him, but, panic-stricken\r\nat the brilliant appearance of the standards and eagles, they implored\r\npardon and peace.\r\n\r\n4. The question of granting it to them was long discussed, with variety\r\nof opinion, between the Roman commanders; but at last, as it seemed for\r\nthe advantage of the republic, a truce was granted, and after they had\r\nagreed to the conditions proposed, one of which was that they should\r\nfurnish a number of young men suitable for military service, the Saxons\r\nwere permitted to withdraw, but without their baggage, and to return to\r\ntheir own country.\r\n\r\n5. But when they, being now freed from all fear, were preparing to\r\nreturn, some of our infantry were sent forward, who secretly laid an\r\nambuscade in a certain hidden defile, from which they would easily be\r\nable to attack them as they passed. But the matter turned out very\r\ndifferently from what was expected.\r\n\r\n6. For some of our men being roused by the noise of the Saxons, sprang\r\nfrom their ambush unseasonably; and being suddenly seen, while they were\r\nhastening to establish themselves, the barbarians, with a terrible yell,\r\nput them to flight. Presently, however, they halted in a solid body, and\r\nbeing now driven to extremities, were compelled to fight, though their\r\nstrength was far from great. The slaughter was great, and they would\r\nhave been all cut off to a man, had not a column of cuirassier cavalry,\r\nwhich had been similarly placed in ambuscade at a place where the road\r\ndivided, in order there also to attack the barbarians in their passage,\r\nbeen roused by the uproar, and come up suddenly.\r\n\r\n7. Then the battle raged more fiercely, and with dauntless breasts the\r\nRomans pressed forward on all sides, and with drawn swords hemmed in\r\ntheir enemies, and slew them; nor did any of them ever return home, for\r\nnot one survived the slaughter. And although an impartial judge will\r\nblame the action as treacherous and disgraceful, still if he weighs all\r\nthe circumstances, he will not regret that a mischievous band of robbers\r\nwas at length destroyed when such an opportunity presented itself.\r\n\r\n8. After these affairs had been consummated thus successfully,\r\nValentinian revolving in his mind a great variety of opinions, was\r\nfilled with anxious solicitude, considering and contemplating different\r\nmeasures for breaking the pride of the Allemanni and their king\r\nMacrianus, who were incessantly and furiously disturbing the republic\r\nwith their restless movements.\r\n\r\n9. For that ferocious nation, though from its earliest origin\r\ndiminished by various disasters, yet continually revives, so that it\r\nmight be considered as having been free from attacks for many ages. At\r\nlast, after the emperor had considered and approved of one plan after\r\nanother, it was finally determined to excite the Burgundians to attack\r\nthem, the Burgundians being a warlike people, with an immense population\r\nof active youths, and therefore formidable to all their neighbours.\r\n\r\n10. And the emperor sent repeated letters to their chiefs by some silent\r\nand trustworthy messengers, to urge them to attack the Allemanni at a\r\ncertain fixed time, and promising that he likewise would cross the Rhine\r\nwith the Roman legions, and attack their forces when in disorder, and\r\nseeking to escape the unexpected attack of the Burgundians.\r\n\r\n11. The letters of the emperor were received with joy, for two reasons:\r\nfirst, because for many ages the Burgundians had looked upon themselves\r\nas descended from the Romans; and secondly, because they had continual\r\nquarrels with the Allemanni about their salt-pits and their borders. So\r\nthey sent against them some picked battalions, which, before the Roman\r\nsoldiers could be collected, advanced as far as the banks of the Rhine,\r\nand, while the emperor was engaged in the construction of some\r\nfortresses, caused the greatest alarm to our people.\r\n\r\n12. Therefore, after waiting for some time, Valentinian having failed to\r\ncome on the appointed day as promised, and finding that none of his\r\nengagements were performed, they sent ambassadors to the court,\r\nrequesting assistance to enable them to return in safety to their own\r\nland, and to save them from exposing their rear unprotected to their\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\n13. But when they perceived that their request was virtually refused by\r\nthe excuses and pleas for delay with which it was received, they\r\ndeparted from the court in sorrow and indignation; and when the chiefs\r\nof the Burgundians received their report, they were very furious,\r\nthinking they had been mocked; and so they slew all their prisoners and\r\nreturned to their native land.\r\n\r\n14. Among them their king is called by one general name of \"Hendinos,\"\r\nand according to a very ancient custom of theirs, is deposed from his\r\nauthority if under his government the state meets with any disaster in\r\nwar; or if the earth fails to produce a good crop; in the same way as\r\nthe Egyptians are accustomed to attribute calamities of that kind to\r\ntheir rulers. The chief priest among the Burgundians is called \"the\r\nSinistus.\" But he is irremovable and not exposed to any such dangers as\r\nthe kings.\r\n\r\n15. Taking advantage of this favourable opportunity, Theodosius, the\r\ncommander of the cavalry, passed through the Tyrol and attacked the\r\nAllemanni, who, out of fear of the Burgundians, had dispersed into their\r\nvillages. He slew a great number, and took some prisoners, whom by the\r\nemperor's command he sent to Italy, where some fertile districts around\r\nthe Po were assigned to them, which they still inhabit as tributaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n§ 1. Let us now migrate, as it were, to another quarter of the world,\r\nand proceed to relate the distresses of Tripoli, a province of Africa;\r\ndistresses which, in my opinion, even Justice herself must have\r\nlamented, and which burst out rapidly like flames. I will now give an\r\naccount both of them and of their causes.\r\n\r\n2. The Asturians are barbarians lying on the frontier of this province,\r\na people always in readiness for rapid invasions, accustomed to live on\r\nplunder and bloodshed; and who, after having been quiet for a while, now\r\nrelapsed into their natural state of disquiet, alleging the following as\r\nthe serious cause for their movements.\r\n\r\n3. One of their countrymen, by name Stachao, while freely traversing our\r\nterritories, as in time of peace, did some things forbidden by the laws;\r\nthe most flagrant of his illegal acts being that he endeavoured, by\r\nevery kind of deceit and intrigue, to betray the province, as was shown\r\nby the most undeniable evidence, for which crime he was burnt to death.\r\n\r\n4. To avenge his death, the Asturians, claiming him as their clansman,\r\nand affirming that he had been unjustly condemned, burst forth from\r\ntheir own territory like so many mad wild beasts during the reign of\r\nJovian, but fearing to approach close to Leptis, which was a city with\r\na numerous population, and fortified by strong walls, they occupied the\r\ndistrict around it, which is very fertile, for three days: and having\r\nslain the agricultural population on it, whom terror at their sudden\r\ninroad had deprived of all spirit, or had driven to take refuge in\r\ncaves, and burnt a great quantity of furniture which could not be\r\ncarried off, they returned home, loaded with vast plunder, taking with\r\nthem as prisoner a man named Silva, the principal noble of Leptis, whom\r\nthey found with his family at his country house.\r\n\r\n5. The people of Leptis being terrified at this sudden disaster, not\r\nwishing to incur the further calamities with which the arrogance of the\r\nbarbarians threatened them, implored the protection of Count Romanus,\r\nwho had recently been promoted to the government of Africa. But when he\r\ncame at the head of an army, and received their request to come to their\r\nimmediate assistance in their distress, he declared that he would not\r\nmove a step further unless abundant magazines and four thousand camels\r\nwere provided for his troops.\r\n\r\n6. At this answer the wretched citizens were stupefied, and declared to\r\nhim, that after the devastations and conflagrations to which they had\r\nbeen exposed, it was impossible for them to make such exertions, even\r\nfor the reparation of the cruel disasters which they had suffered; and,\r\nafter waiting forty days there with vain pretences and excuses, the\r\ncount retired without attempting any enterprise.\r\n\r\n7. The people of Tripoli, disappointed in their hopes, and dreading the\r\nworst extremities, at their next council day, appointed Severus and\r\nFlaccianus ambassadors to carry to Valentinian some golden images of\r\nvictory in honour of his accession to the empire, and to state fully and\r\nboldly to him the miserable distress of the province.\r\n\r\n8. When this step became known, Romanus sent a swift horseman as a\r\nmessenger to the master of the offices, Remigius, his own kinsman and\r\nhis partner in plunder, bidding him take care, that by the emperor's\r\ndecision, the investigation into this matter should be committed to the\r\ndeputy and himself.\r\n\r\n9. The ambassadors arrived at the court, and having obtained access to\r\nthe emperor, they, in a set speech, laid all their distresses before\r\nhim, and presented him with a decree of their council in which the whole\r\naffair was fully set forth. When the emperor had read it, he neither\r\ntrusted the report of the master of the offices, framed to defend the\r\nmisconduct of the count, nor, on the other hand, did he place confidence\r\nin these men who made a contrary report; but promised a full\r\ninvestigation into the affair, which however was deferred in the manner\r\nin which high authorities are wont to let such matters give place to\r\ntheir more pleasant occupations and amusements.\r\n\r\n10. While waiting in suspense and protracted anxiety for some relief\r\nfrom the emperor's camp, the citizens of Tripoli were again attacked by\r\ntroops of the same barbarians, now elated with additional confidence by\r\ntheir past successes. They ravaged the whole territory of Leptis and\r\nalso that of OEa, spreading total ruin and desolation everywhere, and,\r\nat last, retired loaded with an enormous quantity of spoil, and having\r\nslain many of our officers, the most distinguished of whom were\r\nRusticianus, one of the priests, and the ædile, Nicasius.\r\n\r\n11. This invasion was prevented from being repelled by the fact, that at\r\nthe entreaty of the ambassadors, the conduct of the military affairs,\r\nwhich had at first been intrusted to Ruricius, the president, had been\r\nsubsequently transferred to Count Romanus.\r\n\r\n12. So now a new messenger was sent to Gaul with an account of this\r\nfresh disaster; and his intelligence roused the emperor to great anger.\r\nSo Palladius, his secretary, who had also the rank of tribune, was sent\r\nat once to liquidate the pay due to the soldiers, who were dispersed\r\nover Africa, and to examine into all that had taken place in Tripoli, he\r\nbeing an officer whose report could be trusted.\r\n\r\n13. But while all these delays took place from the continual\r\ndeliberations held on the case, and while the people of Tripoli were\r\nstill waiting for the answer, the Asturians, now still more insolent\r\nafter their double success, like birds of prey whose ferocity has been\r\nsharpened by the taste of blood, flew once more to attack them; and\r\nhaving slain every one who did not flee from the danger, they carried\r\noff all the spoil which they had previously left behind, cutting down\r\nall the trees and vines.\r\n\r\n14. Then a certain citizen named Mychon, a man of high station and\r\ngreat influence, was taken prisoner in the district outside of the city;\r\nbut before they could bind him he gave them the slip, and because an\r\nattack of gout rendered him unable to effect his escape, he threw\r\nhimself down a dry well, from which he was drawn up by the barbarians\r\nwith his ribs broken, and was conducted near to the gates of the city,\r\nwhere he was ransomed by the affection of his wife, and was drawn up to\r\nthe battlements of the wall by a rope; but two days afterwards he died.\r\n\r\n15. These events encouraged the pertinacity of the invaders, so that\r\nthey advanced and attacked the very walls of Leptis, which resounded\r\nwith the mournful wailings of the women, who were terrified in an\r\nextraordinary manner and quite bewildered, because they had never before\r\nbeen blockaded by an enemy. And after the city had been besieged for\r\neight days continuously, during which many of the besiegers were\r\nwounded, while they made no progress, they retired much discouraged to\r\ntheir own country.\r\n\r\n16. In consequence of these events, the citizens, being still doubtful\r\nof their safety, and desirous of trying every possible resource, before\r\nthe ambassadors who had been first sent had returned, sent Jovinus and\r\nPancratius to lay before the emperor a faithful account of the\r\nsufferings which they had endured, and which they themselves had seen:\r\nthese envoys found the former ambassadors, Severus and Flaccianus, at\r\nCarthage; and on asking them what they had done, they learnt that they\r\nhad been referred for a hearing to the deputy and the count. And\r\nimmediately after this Severus was attacked by a dangerous illness and\r\ndied; but notwithstanding what they had heard, the new ambassadors\r\nproceeded on their journey to the court.\r\n\r\n17. After this, when Palladius arrived in Africa, the count, who knew on\r\nwhat account he had come, and who had been warned before to take\r\nmeasures for his own safety, sent orders to the principal officers of\r\nthe army by certain persons who were in his secrets, to pay over to him,\r\nas being a person of great influence, and being the person most nearly\r\nconnected with the principal nobles of the palace, the chief part of\r\nthe money for the soldiers' pay which he had brought over, and they\r\nobeyed him.\r\n\r\n18. So he, having been thus suddenly enriched, reached Leptis; and that\r\nhe might arrive at a knowledge of the truth, he took with him to the\r\ndistricts that had been laid waste, Erecthius and Aristomenes, two\r\ncitizens of great eloquence and reputation, who freely unfolded to him\r\nthe distress which their fellow-citizens and the inhabitants of the\r\nadjacent districts had suffered. They showed him everything openly; and\r\nso he returned after seeing the lamentable desolation of the province:\r\nand reproaching Romanus for his inactivity, he threatened to report to\r\nthe emperor an accurate statement of everything which he had seen.\r\n\r\n19. He, inflamed with anger and indignation, retorted that he also\r\nshould soon make a report, that the man who had been sent as an\r\nincorruptible secretary had converted to his own uses all the money\r\nwhich had been sent out as a donation to the soldiers.\r\n\r\n20. The consequence was that Palladius, being hampered by the\r\nconsciousness of his flagitious conduct, proceeded from henceforth in\r\nharmony with Romanus, and when he returned to court, he deceived\r\nValentinian with atrocious falsehoods, affirming that the citizens of\r\nTripoli complained without reason. Therefore he was sent back to Africa\r\na second time with Jovinus, the last of all the ambassadors (for\r\nPancratius had died at Treves), in order that he, in conjunction with\r\nthe deputy, might inquire into everything connected with the second\r\nembassy. And besides this, the emperor ordered the tongues of Erecthius\r\nand Aristomenes to be cut out, because this same Palladius had intimated\r\nthat they made some malignant and disloyal statements.\r\n\r\n21. The secretary, following the deputy, as had been arranged, came to\r\nTripoli. When his arrival was known, Romanus sent one of his servants\r\nthither with all speed, and Cæcilius, his assessor, who was a native of\r\nthe province; and by their agency (whether they employed bribery or\r\ndeceit is doubtful) all the citizens were won over to accuse Jovinus,\r\nvigorously asserting that he had never issued any of the commands which\r\nhe had reported to the emperor; carrying their iniquity to such a\r\npitch, that Jovinus himself was compelled by them to confess, to his\r\nown great danger, that he had made a false report to the emperor.\r\n\r\n22. When these events were learnt from Palladius on his return,\r\nValentinian, being always inclined to severe measures, commanded the\r\nexecution of Jovinus as the author of such a report, and of Cælestinus,\r\nConcordius, and Lucius, as privy to it, and partners in it. He also\r\ncommanded Ruricius, the president, to be put to death for falsehood; the\r\ncharge against him being aggravated by the circumstance that his report\r\ncontained some violent and intemperate expressions.\r\n\r\n23. Ruricius was executed at Sitifis; the rest were condemned at Utica\r\nby the sentence of the deputy Crescens. But before the death of the\r\nambassadors, Flaccianus, while being examined by the deputy and the\r\ncount, and while resolutely defending his own safety, was assailed with\r\nabuse, and then attacked with loud outcries and violence by the angry\r\nsoldiers, and was nearly killed; the charge which they made against him\r\nbeing that the cause which had prevented the people of Tripoli from\r\nbeing defended was, that they had refused to furnish necessaries for the\r\nuse of any expedition.\r\n\r\n24. On this account he was thrown into prison, till the emperor could be\r\nconsulted on his case, and should decide what ought to be done; but his\r\ngaolers were tampered with, as was believed, and he escaped from prison\r\nand fled to Rome, where he concealed himself for some time, till his\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n25. In consequence of this memorable catastrophe, Tripoli, which had\r\nbeen often harassed by external and domestic calamities, brought forward\r\nno further accusations against those who had left it undefended, knowing\r\nthat the eternal eye of justice was awake, as well as the avenging\r\nfuries of the ambassadors and the president. And a long time afterwards\r\nthe following event took place:--Palladius, having been dismissed from\r\nthe military service, and stript of all that nourished his pride,\r\nretired into private life.\r\n\r\n26. And when Theodosius, that magnificent commander of armies, came into\r\nAfrica to put down Firmus, who was entertaining some pernicious designs,\r\nand, as he was ordered, began to examine the movable effects of\r\nRomanus, he found among his papers a letter of a certain person named\r\nMeterius, containing this passage: \"Meterius, to his lord and patron,\r\nRomanus;\" and at the end of the letter many expressions unconnected with\r\nits general subject. \"Palladius, who has been cashiered, salutes you. He\r\nwho says he was cashiered for no other reason than that in the case of\r\nthe people of Tripoli he made a false report to the sacred ears.\"\r\n\r\n27. When this letter was sent to the court and read, Meterius was\r\narrested by order of Valentinian, and confessed that the letter was his\r\nwriting. Therefore Palladius also was ordered to appear, and reflecting\r\non all the crimes he had committed, while at a halting place on the\r\nroad, he watched an opportunity afforded him by the absence of his\r\nguards, as soon as it got dark (for, as it was a festival of the\r\nChristian religion, they passed the whole night in the church), and\r\nhanged himself.\r\n\r\n28. The news of this propitious event--the death of the principal cause\r\nof their sad troubles--being known, Erecthius and Aristomenes, who when\r\nthey first heard that their tongues were ordered to be cut out for\r\nsedition, had escaped, now issued from their hiding-places. And when the\r\nemperor Gratian was informed of the wicked deceit that had been\r\npractised (for by this time Valentinian was dead), their fears vanished,\r\nand they were sent to have their cause heard before Hesperus the\r\nproconsul and Flavian the deputy, men whose justice was supported by the\r\nrighteous authority of the emperor, and who, after putting Cæcilius to\r\nthe torture, learnt from his clear confession that he himself had\r\npersuaded the citizens to bring false accusations against the\r\nambassadors. These actions were followed by a report which gave the\r\nfullest possible account of all that had taken place, to which no answer\r\nwas given.\r\n\r\n29. And that the whole story might want nothing of tragic interest, the\r\nfollowing occurrence also took place after the curtain had fallen.\r\nRomanus went to court, taking with him Cæcilius, with the intent to\r\naccuse the judges as having been unduly biassed in favour of the\r\nprovince; and being received graciously by Merobaudes, he demanded that\r\nsome more necessary witnesses should be summoned. And when they had\r\ncome to Milan, and had shown by proofs which seemed correct, though\r\nthese were false, that they had been falsely accused, they were\r\nacquitted, and returned home. Valentinian was still alive, when after\r\nthese events which we have related, Remigius also retired from public\r\nlife, and afterwards hanged himself, as we shall relate in the proper\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\r\n[165] See the Iliad, XVIII. 1. 645, where Ajax prays:--\r\n\r\n              \"Lord of earth and air,\r\n  O King! O Father, hear my humble prayer!\r\n  Dispel this cloud, the light of heaven restore;\r\n  Give me to see, and Ajax asks no more!\r\n  If Greece must perish, we thy will obey,\r\n  But let us perish in the face of day.\"\r\n\r\nPOPE'S _Trans._, 1. 727, etc.\r\n\r\n[166] See Gibbon, vol.

Theodorus, the secretary, aims at the imperial authority, and\r\n     being accused of treason before Valens at Antioch, and convicted,\r\n     is executed, with many of his accomplices.--II. In the East many\r\n     persons are informed against as guilty of poisoning and other\r\n     crimes; and being condemned (some rightly, some wrongfully), are\r\n     executed.--III.

At the conclusion of the winter, Sapor, king of Persia, being full\r\nof cruelty and arrogance from the confidence engendered by his former\r\nbattles, having completed his army to its full number, and greatly\r\nstrengthened it, sent out a force of cuirassiers, archers, and mercenary\r\ntroops, to make an invasion of our territories.\r\n\r\n2. Against this force, Count Trajan and Vadomarius, the ex-king of the\r\nAllemanni, advanced with a mighty army, having been enjoined by the\r\nemperor to remember his orders to act on the defensive rather than on\r\nthe offensive against the Persians.\r\n\r\n3. When they arrived at Vagabanta, a place well suited for the\r\nmanoeuvres of the legions, they supported against their will a rapid\r\ncharge which was made upon them by the squadrons of the enemy, and\r\nretreated with the design not to be the first to slay any of the hostile\r\nsoldiers, and not to be looked upon as guilty of having broken the\r\ntreaty. At last, under the pressure of extreme necessity, they came to\r\nan engagement with the barbarians, and after having slain a great number\r\nof them, were victorious.\r\n\r\n4. During the cessation of regular operations which ensued, several\r\nslight skirmishes occurred through the impatience of both armies, which\r\nended with different results; and at last the summer ended, and a truce\r\nwas agreed to by common consent, and the two armies separated, though\r\nthe generals were violently inflamed against each other. The king of\r\nParthia, intending to pass the winter at Ctesiphon, returned to his own\r\nhome, and the Roman emperor went to Antioch; and while he tarried there,\r\nin complete security from foreign enemies, he had very nearly perished\r\nthrough domestic treachery, as shall be related in the coming narrative.\r\n\r\n5. A certain Procopius, a restless man, at all times covetous and fond\r\nof disturbances, had persuaded Anatolius and Spudasius, officers about\r\nthe palace, who had been ordered to restore what they had appropriated\r\nfrom the treasury, to bring a plot against the Count Fortunatianus, who\r\nwas especially obnoxious as being represented to be the principal\r\ndemander of this restitution. He, being a man of naturally harsh temper,\r\nwas thereupon inflamed almost to insanity, and exercising the authority\r\nof the office which he filled, he delivered up to trial before the\r\ntribunal of the prefect a person of the lowest birth, named Palladius,\r\nfor being a poisoner in the train of Anatolius and Spudasius;\r\nHeliodorus, also an interpreter of the Fates from the events which\r\nhappened at any one's birth; with the intent that they should be\r\ncompelled by torture to relate all that they knew.\r\n\r\n6. And when they came with rigid scrutiny to inquire into what had been\r\ndone or attempted, Palladius boldly exclaimed, that the matters now\r\nunder investigation were trivial, and such as might well be passed over;\r\nthat he himself, if he might be allowed to speak, could bring forward\r\nsome circumstances both formidable and more important, which, having\r\nbeen prepared with great exertion, would throw everything into\r\nconfusion, if they were not provided against beforehand. Being ordered\r\nto explain without fear all he knew, he made a deposition at great\r\nlength, affirming that Fidustius the president, and Pergamius and\r\nIrenæus, had secretly learnt, by the detestable arts of magic, the name\r\nof the person who should become emperor after Valens.\r\n\r\n7. Fidustius was at once arrested (for he happened by chance be on the\r\nspot), and being brought secretly before the emperor, when confronted\r\nwith the informer, he did not attempt by any denial to throw a doubt on\r\nwhat was already revealed, but laid open the whole of this wretched\r\nplot; confessing in plain words, that he himself, with Hilarius and\r\nPatricius, men skilled in the art of soothsaying, of whom Hilarius had\r\nfilled high offices in the palace, had held consultations about the\r\nfuture possessors of the empire; that by secret arts they had searched\r\ninto the Fates, which had revealed to them the name of an excellent\r\nemperor, admonishing them at the same time that a miserable end awaited\r\nthe investigators of these omens.[176]\r\n\r\n8. And while they were hesitating, unable to decide who at that moment\r\nwas superior to all other men in vigour of mind, Theodorus appeared to\r\nexcel all the rest, a man who had already arrived at the second class of\r\nsecretaries. And in truth he deserved the opinion which they entertained\r\nof him; for he was descended from an ancient and illustrious family in\r\nGaul; he had been liberally educated from his earliest childhood; he was\r\neminent for modesty, prudence, humanity, courtesy, and literature. He\r\nalways appeared superior to the post or place which he was filling, and\r\nwas equally popular among high and low, and he was nearly the only man\r\nwhose tongue was never unbridled, but who always reflected on what he\r\nwas going to say, yet without ever being restrained by any fear of\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\n9. Fidustius, who had been tortured so severely that he was at the point\r\nof death, added further, that all that he had now stated he had\r\ncommunicated to Theodorus by the intervention of Eucærius, a man of\r\ngreat literary accomplishments, and of very high reputation; indeed, he\r\nhad a little time before governed Asia with the title of proprefect.\r\n\r\n10. Eucærius was now thrown into prison; and when a report of all that\r\nhad taken place was, as usual, laid before the emperor, his amazing\r\nferocity burst out more unrestrainedly than ever, like a burning\r\nfirebrand, being fed by the base adulation of many persons, and\r\nespecially of Modestus, at that time prefect of the prætorium.\r\n\r\n11. He, being every day alarmed at the prospect of a successor,\r\naddressed himself to the task of conciliating Valens, who was of a\r\nrustic and rather simple character, by tickling him with all kinds of\r\ndisguised flattery and caresses, calling his uncouth language and rude\r\nexpressions \"flowers of Ciceronian eloquence.\" Indeed, to raise his\r\nvanity higher, he would have promised to raise him up to the stars if he\r\nhad desired it.\r\n\r\n12. So Theodorus also was ordered to be arrested with all speed at\r\nConstantinople, to which city he had repaired on some private business,\r\nand to be brought to the court. And while he was on his way back, in\r\nconsequence of various informations and trials which were carried on day\r\nand night, numbers of people were dragged away from the most widely\r\nseparated countries--men eminent for their birth and high authority.\r\n\r\n13. The public prisons, being now completely filled, could no longer\r\ncontain the crowds which were confined in them, while private houses\r\nwere equally crammed to suffocation, for nearly every one was a\r\nprisoner, and every man shuddered to think when it might be his turn or\r\nthat of his nearest relations.\r\n\r\n14. At last Theodorus himself arrived, in deep mourning, and half dead\r\nthrough fear. And while he was kept concealed in some obscure place in\r\nthe vicinity, and all things were being got ready for his intended\r\nexamination, the trumpet of civil discord suddenly sounded.\r\n\r\n15. And because that man who knowingly passes over facts appears to be\r\nan equally unfaithful historian with him who invents circumstances which\r\nnever happened, we do not deny (what, in fact, is quite undoubted) that\r\nthe safety of Valens had often before been attacked by secret\r\nmachinations, and was now in the greatest possible danger. And that a\r\nsword, as one may say, was presented to his throat by the officers of\r\nthe army, and only averted by Fate, which was reserving him for\r\nlamentable misfortunes in Thrace.\r\n\r\n16. For one day as he was taking a gentle nap in the afternoon, in a\r\nshady spot between Antioch and Seleucia, he was attacked by Sallust, at\r\nthat time an officer of the Scutarii; and on various other occasions he\r\nwas plotted against by many other persons, from whose treacherous\r\ndesigns he only escaped because the precise moment of his death had been\r\ndetermined at his birth by Destiny.\r\n\r\n17. As sometimes happened in the times of the emperors Commodus and\r\nSeverus, whose safety was continually assailed with extreme violence, so\r\nthat after many various dangers at the hands of their countrymen, the\r\none was dangerously wounded by a dagger in the amphitheatre, as he\r\nentered it for the purpose of witnessing an entertainment, by a senator\r\nnamed Quintianus, a man of wicked ambition. The other, when extremely\r\nold, was assailed as he was lying in his bedchamber, by a centurion of\r\nthe name of Saturninus, who was instigated to the act by Plautian the\r\nprefect, and would have been killed if his youthful son had not come to\r\nhis assistance.\r\n\r\n18. Valens, therefore, was to be excused for taking every precaution to\r\ndefend his life, which traitors were endeavouring to take. But it was an\r\nunpardonable fault in him that, through tyrannical pride, he, with haste\r\nand with inconsiderate and malicious persecution, inflicted the same\r\nseverities on the innocent as on the guilty, making no distinction\r\nbetween their deserts; so that while the judges were still doubting\r\nabout their guilt, the emperor had made up his mind about their\r\npunishment, and men learnt that they were condemned before they knew\r\nthat they were suspected.\r\n\r\n19. But his obstinate resolution was strengthened since it received a\r\nspur from his own avarice, and that also of those who at that time were\r\nabout the palace, and were constantly seeking new sources of gain; while\r\nif on any rare occasion any mention was made of humanity, they styled it\r\nslackness; and by their bloodthirsty flatteries perverted the\r\nresolution of a man who bore men's lives on the tip of his tongue,\r\nguiding it in the worst direction, and assailing everything with\r\nunseemly confusion, while seeking to accomplish the total ruin of the\r\nmost opulent houses.\r\n\r\n20. For Valens was a man who was especially exposed and open to the\r\napproaches of treacherous advisers, being tainted with two vices of a\r\nmost mischievous character: one, that when he was ashamed of being\r\nangry, that very shame only rendered him the more intolerably furious;\r\nand secondly, that the stories which, with the easiness of access of a\r\nprivate individual, he heard in secret whispers, he took at once to be\r\ntrue and certain, because his haughty idea of the imperial dignity did\r\nnot permit him to examine whether they were true or not.\r\n\r\n21. The consequence was that, under an appearance of clemency, numbers\r\nof innocent men were driven from their homes, and sent into exile: and\r\ntheir property was confiscated to the public treasury, and then seized\r\nby himself for his private uses; so that the owners, after their\r\ncondemnation, had no means of subsistence but such as they could beg;\r\nand were worn out with the distresses of the most miserable poverty. For\r\nfear of which that wise old poet Theognis advises a man to rush even\r\ninto the sea.[177]\r\n\r\n22. And even if any one should grant that these sentences were in some\r\ninstances right, yet it surely was an odious severity; and from this\r\nconduct of his it was remarked that the maxim was sound which says,\r\n\"that there is no sentence more cruel than that which, while seeming to\r\nspare, is still harsh.\"\r\n\r\n23. Therefore all the chief magistrates and the prefect of the\r\nprætorium, to whom the conduct of these investigations was committed,\r\nhaving been assembled together, the racks were got ready, and the\r\nweights, and lead, and scourges, and other engines of torture. And all\r\nplaces resounded with the horrors of the cruel voice of the\r\nexecutioners, and the cries uttered amid the clanking of chains: \"Hold\r\nhim!\" \"Shut him up!\" \"Squeeze him!\" \"Hide him!\" and other yells uttered\r\nby the ministers of those hateful duties.\r\n\r\n24. And since we saw numbers condemned to death after having endured\r\ncruel torture, everything being thrown into complete confusion as if in\r\nperfect darkness, because the complete recollection of everything which\r\nthen took place has in some degree escaped me, I will mention briefly\r\nwhat I do remember.\r\n\r\n25. Among the first who were summoned before the bench, was Pergamius,\r\nwho, as we have already mentioned, was betrayed by Palladius, who\r\naccused him of having arrived at a foreknowledge of certain events\r\nthrough wicked incantations. As he was a man of exceeding eloquence, and\r\nvery likely to say dangerous things, and after some very trivial\r\ninterrogatories had been put to him, seeing that the judges were\r\nhesitating what questions to put first and what last, he began himself\r\nto harangue them boldly, and shouting out the names with a loud voice\r\nand without any cessation, he named several thousand persons as\r\naccomplices with himself, demanding that people should be brought\r\nforward to be accused of great crimes from every part of the empire, up\r\nto the very shores of the great Atlantic. The task that he thus seemed\r\nto be putting together for them was too arduous; so they condemned him\r\nto death; and afterwards put whole troops of others to death, till they\r\ncame to the case of Theodorus, which was regarded, after the manner of\r\nthe Olympian games, as a crowning of the whole.\r\n\r\n26. The same day, among other circumstances, this melancholy event took\r\nplace, that Salia, who a little while before had been the chief\r\ntreasurer in Thrace, when he was about to be brought out of his prison\r\nto have his cause heard, and was putting on his shoes, as if suddenly\r\noverwhelmed by the dread of his impending destruction, died in the hands\r\nof his gaolers.\r\n\r\n27. So when the court was opened, and when the judges exhibited the\r\ndecrees of the law, though, in accordance with the desire of the\r\nemperor, they moderated the severity of the charges brought before them,\r\none general alarm seized all people. For Valens had now so wholly\r\ndeparted from justice, and had become so accomplished in the infliction\r\nof injury, that he was like a wild beast in an amphitheatre; and if any\r\none who had been brought before the court escaped, he grew furious\r\nbeyond all restraint.\r\n\r\n28. Presently Patricius and Hilarius were brought before the court, and\r\nwere ordered to enumerate the whole series of their actions: and as they\r\ndiffered a little at the beginning of their statement, they were both\r\nput to the torture, and presently the tripod which they had used was\r\nbrought in;[178] and they, being reduced now to the greatest extremity,\r\ngave a true account of the whole affair from the very beginning. And\r\nfirst Hilarius spoke as follows:--\r\n\r\n29. \"We did construct, most noble judges, under most unhappy auspices,\r\nthis little unfortunate tripod which you see, in the likeness of that at\r\nDelphi, making it of laurel twigs: and having consecrated it with\r\nimprecations of mysterious verses, and with many decorations and\r\nrepeated ceremonies, in all proper order, we at last moved it; and the\r\nmanner in which we moved it as often as we consulted it upon any secret\r\naffair, was as follows:--\r\n\r\n30. \"It was placed in the middle of a building, carefully purified on\r\nall sides by Arabian perfumes; and a plain round dish was placed upon\r\nit, made of different metals. On the outer side of which the\r\nfour-and-twenty letters of the alphabet were engraved with great skill,\r\nbeing separated from one another by distances measured with great\r\nprecision.\r\n\r\n31. \"Then a person clothed in linen garments, and shod with slippers of\r\nlinen, with a small linen cap on his head, bearing in his hand sprigs of\r\nvervain as a plant of good omen, in set verses, propitiated the deity\r\nwho presides over foreknowledge, and thus took his station by this dish,\r\naccording to all the rules of the ceremony. Then over the tripod he\r\nbalanced a ring which he held suspended by a flaxen thread of extreme\r\nfineness, and which had also been consecrated with mystic ceremonies.\r\nAnd as this ring touched and bounded off from the different letters\r\nwhich still preserved their distances distinct, he made with these\r\nletters, by the order in which he touched them, verses in the heroic\r\nmetre, corresponding to the questions which we had asked; the verses\r\nbeing also perfect in metre and rhythm; like the answers of the Pythia\r\nwhich are so celebrated, or those given by the oracles of the Branchidæ.\r\n\r\n32. \"Then, when we asked who should succeed the present emperor, since\r\nit was said that it would be a person of universal accomplishments, the\r\nring bounded up, and touched the two syllables +THEO+; and then\r\nas it added another letter, some one of the bystanders exclaimed that\r\nTheodorus was pointed out by the inevitable decrees of Fate. We asked no\r\nfurther questions concerning the matter: for it seemed quite plain to us\r\nthat he was the man who was intended.\"\r\n\r\n33. And when he had with this exactness laid the knowledge of this\r\naffair open to the eyes of the judges, he added with great benevolence,\r\nthat Theodorus knew nothing of the matter. When after this they were\r\nasked whether the oracles which they had consulted had given them any\r\nforeknowledge of their present sufferings, they repeated these\r\nwell-known verses which clearly pronounce that this employment of\r\ninvestigating those high secrets would cost them their lives.\r\nNevertheless, they added, that the Furies equally threatened the judges\r\nthemselves, and also the emperor, breathing only slaughter and\r\nconflagration against them. It will be enough to quote the three final\r\nverses.\r\n\r\n  +\"Ou man nêpoinige son essetai haima, kai autois\r\n  Tisiphonê barymênis ephoplizei kanion oiton\r\n  En pedioisi Mimantos alalemenoisin arêa.\"+\r\n\r\n  \"Thy blood shall not fall unaveng'd on earth:\r\n  The fierce Tisiphone still keeps her eye\r\n  Fixed on thy slayers; arming evil fate\r\n  Against them when arrayed on Mima's plain\r\n  They seek to stem the tide of horrid war.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he had read these verses they were both tortured with great\r\nseverity, and carried away dead.\r\n\r\n34. Afterwards, that the whole workshop where the wickedness had been\r\nwrought might be disclosed to the world, a great number of men of rank\r\nwere brought in, among whom were some of the original promoters of the\r\nwhole business. And when each, regarding nothing but his own personal\r\nsafety, sought to turn the destruction which menaced himself in some\r\nother quarter, by the permission of the judges, Theodorus began to\r\naddress them. First of all, he humbled himself with entreaties for\r\npardon; then being compelled to answer more precisely to the charges\r\nalleged, he proved that he, after having been informed of the whole\r\naffair by Eucærius, was prevented by him from repeating it to the\r\nemperor, as he had often attempted to do: since Eucærius affirmed that\r\nwhat did not spring from a lawless desire of reigning, but from some\r\nfixed law of inevitable fate, would surely come to pass.\r\n\r\n35. Eucærius, when cruelly tortured, confirmed this statement by his own\r\nconfession. His own letters were employed to convict Theodorus, letters\r\nwhich he had written to Hilarius full of indirect hints, which showed\r\nthat he had conceived a sure hope of such events from the prophecies of\r\nthe soothsayers; and was not inclined to delay, but was looking for an\r\nopportunity of attaining the object of his desires.\r\n\r\n36. After the establishment of these facts, the prisoners were removed;\r\nand Eutropius, who at that time was governing Asia with the rank of\r\nproconsul, having been involved in the accusation as having been a\r\npartisan of theirs, was nevertheless acquitted; being exculpated by\r\nPasiphilus the philosopher, who, though cruelly tortured to make him\r\nimplicate Eutropius by a wicked lie, could not be moved from his\r\nvigorous resolution and fortitude.\r\n\r\n37. To that was added the philosopher Simonides, a young man, but the\r\nmost rigidly virtuous of all men in our time. An information had been\r\nlaid against him as having been made aware of what was going on by\r\nFidustius, as he saw that his cause depended, not on its truth, but on\r\nthe will of one man, avowed that he had known all that was alleged, but\r\nhad forborne to mention it out of regard for his character for\r\nconstancy.\r\n\r\n38. When all these matters had been minutely inquired into, the emperor,\r\nin answer to the question addressed to him by the judges, ordered them\r\nall to be condemned and at once executed: and it was not without\r\nshuddering that the vast populace beheld the mournful spectacle; filling\r\nthe whole air with lamentations (since they looked on the misery of each\r\nindividual as threatening the whole community with a similar fate) when\r\nthe whole number of accused persons, except Simonides, were executed in\r\na melancholy manner. Simonides being reserved to be burnt alive by the\r\nexpress command of the savage judge, who was enraged at his dignified\r\nconstancy.\r\n\r\n39. And he, abandoning life as an imperious mistress, and defying the\r\nsudden destruction thus coming on him, was burnt without giving any sign\r\nof shrinking; imitating, in his death, the philosopher Peregrinus,\r\nsurnamed Proteus, who having determined to quit the world, at the\r\nquinquennial games of Olympia, in the sight of all Greece, mounted a\r\nfuneral pile which he had built himself, and was there burnt alive.\r\n\r\n40. After his death, on the ensuing days a vast multitude of almost all\r\nranks, whose names it would be too arduous a task to enumerate, being\r\nconvicted by calumnious accusations, were despatched by the\r\nexecutioners, after having been first exhausted by every description of\r\ntorture. Some were put to death without a moment's breathing-time or\r\ndelay, while the question was still being asked whether they deserved to\r\nbe punished at all; in fact, men were slaughtered like sheep in all\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\n41. After this, innumerable quantities of papers, and many heaps of\r\nvolumes were collected, and burnt under the eyes of the judges, having\r\nbeen taken out of various houses as unlawful books; in order to lessen\r\nthe unpopularity arising from so many executions, though in fact, the\r\ngreater part of them were books teaching various kinds of liberal\r\naccomplishments, or books of law.\r\n\r\n42. Not long afterwards, Maximus, the celebrated philosopher, a man of\r\nvast reputation for learning, from whose eloquent discourses the emperor\r\nJulian derived his great learning and wisdom, being accused of having\r\nbeen acquainted with the verses of the oracle mentioned above, and\r\nconfessing that he had known something of them, but that he had not\r\ndivulged what he knew, as being bound to keep silence out of\r\nconsideration for his promise; but adding that he had of his own accord\r\npredicted that those who had consulted the oracle would perish by public\r\nexecution, was conducted to Ephesus, his native place, and there\r\nbeheaded. And thus by his own forfeiture of life, he found that the\r\ninjustice of a judge is the worst of all crimes.\r\n\r\n43. Diogenes, too, a man of noble family, great forensic eloquence and\r\npre-eminent courtesy, who had some time before been governor of\r\nBithynia, being entangled in the toils of wicked falsehood, was put to\r\ndeath in order to afford a pretext for seizing on his ample patrimony.\r\n\r\n44. Alypius also, who had been governor of Britain, a man of most\r\ndelightful mildness of temper, and who had lived a tranquil and retired\r\nlife (since even against such as him did Injustice stretch forth her\r\nhands), was involved in the greatest misfortune; and was accused with\r\nHierocles his son, a youth of most amiable disposition of having been\r\nguilty of poisoning, on the unsupported information of a low fellow\r\nnamed Diogenes, who had been tortured with extreme severity to force him\r\nto make confessions which might please the emperor, or rather, which\r\nmight please his accuser. When his limbs could no longer endure their\r\npunishment, he was burnt alive; and Alypius, after having had his\r\nproperty confiscated, was condemned to banishment, though by an\r\nextraordinary piece of good fortune he received back his son after he\r\nhad been condemned, and had actually been led out to suffer a miserable\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. During all this time, Palladius, the original cause of these\r\nmiseries, whom we have already spoken of as having been arrested by\r\nFortunatianus, being, from the lowness of his original condition, a man\r\nready to fall into every kind of wickedness, by heaping one murder on\r\nanother diffused mourning and lamentation over the whole empire.\r\n\r\n2. For being allowed to name any persons he chose, without distinction\r\nof rank, as men contaminated by the practice of forbidden arts, like a\r\nhuntsman who has learnt to mark the secret tracks of wild beasts, he\r\nenclosed many victims within his wretched toils, some as being polluted\r\nwith a knowledge of poisonings, others as accomplices of those who were\r\nguilty of treason.\r\n\r\n3. And that wives too might not have leisure to weep over the miseries\r\nof their husbands, officers were sent at once to seal up the house of\r\nany one who was condemned, and who, while examining all the furniture,\r\nslipped in among it old women's incantations, or ridiculous love-tokens,\r\ncontrived to bring destruction on the innocent; and then, when these\r\nthings were mentioned before the bench, where neither law, nor religion,\r\nnor equity were present to separate truth from falsehood, those whom\r\nthey thus accused, though utterly void of offence, without any\r\ndistinction, youths, and decrepit old men, without being heard in their\r\ndefence, found their property confiscated, and were hurried off to\r\nexecution in litters.\r\n\r\n4. One of the consequences in the eastern provinces was, that from fear\r\nof similar treatment, people burnt all their libraries; so great was the\r\nterror which seized upon all ranks. For, to cut my story short, at that\r\ntime all of us crawled about as if in Cimmerian darkness, in the same\r\nkind of dread as the guest of Dionysius of Sicily; who, while feasting\r\nat a banquet more irksome than famine itself, saw a sword suspended over\r\nhis head by a single horsehair.\r\n\r\n5. There was a man named Bassianus, of most noble family, a secretary,\r\nand eminently distinguished for his military services, who, on a charge\r\nof having entertained ambitious projects, and of having sought oracles\r\nconcerning their issue, though he declared he had only consulted the\r\noracles to know the sex of his next child, was saved indeed from death\r\nby the great interest made for him by his relations who protected him;\r\nbut he was stripped of all his splendid inheritance.\r\n\r\n6. Amid all this destruction and ruin, Heliodorus, that hellish\r\ncolleague of Palladius in bringing about these miseries (being what the\r\ncommon people call a mathematician), having been admitted into the\r\nsecret conferences of the imperial palace, and been tempted by every\r\nkind of caress and cajolery to relate all he knew or could invent, was\r\nputting forth his fatal stings.\r\n\r\n7. For he was carefully feasted on the most delicate food, and furnished\r\nwith large sums of money to give to his concubines; and he strutted\r\nabout in every direction with a pompous, haughty countenance, and was\r\nuniversally dreaded. Being the more confident and arrogant, because as\r\nhe was high chamberlain, he could go constantly and openly to the\r\nbrothels, in which, as he desired, he was freely entertained, while\r\nrevealing the edicts of the \"parental guardian of the state,\" which were\r\ndestined to be disastrous to many.\r\n\r\n8. And through his means, as an advocate at the bar, Valens was\r\ninstructed beforehand in what would most contribute to success--what to\r\nplace in the first part of his speech, and with what figures, and what\r\ninventions to work up splendid passages.\r\n\r\n9. And as it would take a long time to enumerate all the devices of that\r\nvillain, I will mention this one only, which, in its rash boldness,\r\nassailed the very pillars of the patrician dignity. As I have said\r\nbefore, he was raised to exceeding arrogance by being admitted to the\r\nsecret conferences of the princes; and being, from the lowness of his\r\nbirth, a man ready for any wickedness, he laid an information against\r\nthat illustrious pair of consuls, the brothers Eusebius and Hypatius,\r\nrelations of the former emperor Constantius, as having conceived desires\r\nof a higher fortune, and formed projects and entered into enterprises\r\nfor the attainment of supreme power. Adding, in order to procure\r\nadditional credit for this falsehood, that Eusebius had had a set of\r\nimperial robes prepared for him.\r\n\r\n10. And when the story had been swallowed willingly, Valens raging and\r\nthreatening, a prince who never ought to have had any power at all,\r\nbecause he thought that everything, even injustice, was in his power,\r\nwas incessantly active in causing the production, even from the most\r\ndistant countries, of all those whom the lawless accuser in profound\r\nsecurity had insisted ought to be produced; and further commanded a\r\nprosecution to be instituted on the criminal charge.\r\n\r\n11. And when equity had long been tossed to and fro by knotty\r\ndifficulties, while that abandoned profligate persisted with unyielding\r\nobstinacy in maintaining the truth of his assertions, while the severest\r\ntortures were unable to wring any confession from the prisoners, and\r\nwhen every circumstance proved that those eminent men were free from all\r\nconsciousness of anything of the kind, still the false accuser was\r\ntreated with the same respect as he had previously received. But though\r\nthe prisoners were sentenced to exile and a heavy fine, a short time\r\nafterwards they were recalled from banishment, restored to their former\r\nrank and dignity, and their fine repaid.\r\n\r\n12. Still after all these shameful transactions, the prince did not\r\nproceed with any more moderation or decency than before; never\r\nconsidering that in a wise government it is well not to be too keen in\r\nhunting out offences, even as a means of inflicting distress upon one's\r\nenemies; and that nothing is so unbecoming as to display a bitterness of\r\ndisposition in connection with supreme authority.\r\n\r\n13. But when Heliodorus died, whether of sickness or through some\r\ndeliberate violence is uncertain (I should not like to say, and I wish\r\nthat the facts themselves were equally silent), many men of rank in\r\nmourning robes, among whom were these two brothers of consular rank, by\r\nthe express command of the emperor, attended his funeral when he was\r\nborne to his grave by the undertakers.\r\n\r\n14. At that time, and in that place, the whole vileness and stupidity of\r\nthe ruler of the empire was publicly displayed. When he was entreated to\r\nabstain from abandoning himself to inconsolable grief, he remained\r\nobstinately inflexible, as if he had stopped his ears with wax to pass\r\nthe rocks of the Sirens.\r\n\r\n15. But at last, being overcome by the pertinacious entreaties of his\r\ncourt, he ordered some persons to go on foot, bareheaded, and with their\r\nhands folded, to the burial-place of this wretched gladiator to do him\r\nhonour. One shudders now to recollect the decree by which so many men of\r\nhigh rank were humiliated, especially some of consular dignity, after\r\nall their truncheons and robes of honour, and all the worldly parade of\r\nhaving their names recorded in the annals of their nation.\r\n\r\n16. Among them all, our friend Hypatius was most conspicuous,\r\nrecommended as he was to every one by the beauty of the virtues which he\r\nhad practised from his youth; being a man of quiet and gentle wisdom,\r\npreserving an undeviating honesty combined with the greatest courtesy of\r\nmanner, so that he conferred a fresh lustre on the glory of his\r\nancestors, and was an ornament to his posterity, by the memorable\r\nactions which he performed in the office of prefect, to which he was\r\ntwice appointed.\r\n\r\n17. At the same time, this circumstance came to crown the other\r\nsplendid actions of Valens, that, while in the case of others he gave\r\nway to such furious violence, that he was even vexed when the severity\r\nof their punishment was terminated by death, yet he pardoned\r\nPollentianus, the tribune, a man stained with such enormous wickedness,\r\nthat at that very time he was convicted on his own confession of having\r\ncut out the womb of a living woman and taken from it her child, in order\r\nto summon forth spirits from the shades below, and to consult them about\r\na change in the empire. He looked on this wretch with the eye of\r\nfriendship, in spite of the murmurs of the whole bench of senators, and\r\ndischarged him in safety, suffering him to retain not only his life, but\r\nhis vast riches and full rank in the army.\r\n\r\n18. O most glorious learning, granted by the express gift of heaven to\r\nhappy mortals, thou who hast often refined even vicious natures! How\r\nmany faults in the darkness of that age wouldst thou have corrected if\r\nValens had ever been taught by thee that, according to the definition of\r\nwise men, empire is nothing else but the care of the safety of others;\r\nand that it is the duty of a good emperor to restrain power, to resist\r\nany desire to possess all things, and all implacability of passion, and\r\nto know, as the dictator Cæsar used to say, \"That the recollection of\r\ncruelty was an instrument to make old age miserable!\" And therefore that\r\nit behoves any one who is about to pass a sentence affecting the life\r\nand existence of a man, who is a portion of the world, and makes up the\r\ncomplement of living creatures, to hesitate long and much, and never to\r\ngive way to intemperate haste in a case in which what is done is\r\nirrevocable. According to that example well known to all antiquity.\r\n\r\n19. When Dolabella was proconsul in Asia, a matron at Smyrna confessed\r\nthat she had poisoned her son and her husband, because she had\r\ndiscovered that they had murdered a son whom she had had by a former\r\nhusband. Her case was adjourned--the council to whom it had been\r\nreferred being in doubt how to draw a line between just revenge and\r\nunprovoked crime; and so she was remitted to the judgment of the\r\nAreopagus, those severe Athenian judges, who are said to have decided\r\ndisputes even among the gods. They, when they had heard the case,\r\nordered the woman and her accuser to appear before them again in a\r\nhundred years, to avoid either acquitting a poisoner, or punishing one\r\nwho had been the avenger of her kindred. So that is never to be thought\r\ntoo slow which is the last of all things.\r\n\r\n20. After all the acts of various iniquity already mentioned, and after\r\neven the free persons who were allowed to survive had been thus\r\nshamefully branded, the eye of Justice which never sleeps, that\r\nunceasing witness and avenger of events, became more attentive and\r\nvigilant. For the avenging Furies of those who had been put to death,\r\nworking on the everlasting deity with their just complaints, kindled the\r\ntorches of war, to confirm the truth of the oracle, which had given\r\nwarning that no crime can be perpetrated with impunity.\r\n\r\n21. While the affairs thus narrated were taking place, Antioch was\r\nexposed to great distress through domestic dissension, though not\r\nmolested by any attacks on the side of Parthia. But the horrid troop of\r\nFuries, which after having caused all sorts of miseries there, had\r\nquitted that city, now settled on the neck of the whole of Asia, as will\r\nbe seen in what follows.\r\n\r\n22. A certain native of Trent, by name Festus, a man of the lowest\r\nobscurity of birth, being a relation of Maximin, and one who had assumed\r\nthe manly robe at the same time with himself, was cherished by him as a\r\ncompanion, and by the will of the Fates had now crossed over to the\r\neast, and having there become governor of Syria, and master of the\r\nrecords, he set a very good and respectable example of lenity. From this\r\nhe was promoted to govern Asia with the rank of proconsul, being thus,\r\nas the saying is, borne on with a fair wind to glory.\r\n\r\n23. And hearing that Maximin caused the destruction of every virtuous\r\nman, he began from this time to denounce his actions as mischievous and\r\ndisgraceful. But when he saw that, in consequence of the removal of\r\nthose persons whom he had impiously put to death, that wicked man had\r\narrived at the dignity of prefect, he began to be excited to similar\r\nconduct and similar hopes. And suddenly changing his character like an\r\nactor, he applied himself to the study of doing injury, and went about\r\nwith fixed and severe eyes, trusting that he also should soon become a\r\nprefect, if he only polluted himself with the blood of innocent men.\r\n\r\n24. And although there are many and various instances in which, to put\r\nthe best construction on them, he acted with great harshness, still it\r\nwill be sufficient to enumerate a few, which are notorious and commonly\r\nspoken of, seeming to be done in rivalry of the deeds which were\r\ncommitted at Rome; for the principle of good and bad actions is the same\r\neverywhere, even if the importance of the circumstances be unequal.\r\n\r\n25. There was a philosopher named Cæranius, a man of no inconsiderable\r\nmerit, whom he put to death with the most cruel tortures, and without\r\nany one coming forward to avenge him, because, when writing familiarly\r\nto his wife, he had put a postscript in Greek, \"+sy de noei, kai\r\nstephe tên pylên.+\"--\"Do you take care and adorn the gate,\" which is a\r\ncommon expression to let the hearer know that something of importance is\r\nto be done.\r\n\r\n26. There was a certain simple old woman who was wont to cure\r\nintermittent fever by a gentle incantation, whom he put to death as a\r\nwitch, after she had been summoned, with his consent, to his daughter,\r\nand had cured her.\r\n\r\n27. There was a certain citizen of high respectability, among whose\r\npapers, when they were searched by the officers on some business or\r\nother, was found the nativity of some one of the name of Valens. He,\r\nwhen asked on what account he had troubled himself about the star of the\r\nemperor, had repelled the accusation by declaring that it was his own\r\nbrother Valens whose nativity was thus found, and when he promised to\r\nbring abundant proof that he had long been dead, the judges would not\r\nwait for evidence of the truth of his assertion, but put him to the\r\ntorture and cruelly slew him.\r\n\r\n28. A young man was seen in the bath to put the fingers of each hand\r\nalternately against the marble and against his own chest, and then to\r\nrepeat the names of the seven vowels, fancying that a remedy for a pain\r\nin the stomach. For this he was brought before the court, put to the\r\ntorture, and then beheaded.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. These events, and the account of Gaul to which I am now about to\r\nproceed, will cause some interruption to the narration of occurrences in\r\nthe metropolis. Among many terrible circumstances, I find that Maximin\r\nwas still prefect, who by the wide extent of his power was a cruel\r\nprompter to the emperor, who combined the most unrestrained licence with\r\nunbounded power. Whoever, therefore, considers what I have related, must\r\nalso reflect on the other facts which have been passed over, and, like a\r\nprudent man, he will pardon me if I do not record everything which the\r\nwickedness of certain counsels has occasioned by exaggerating every\r\naccusation?\r\n\r\n2. For while severity, the foe of all right principles, increased,\r\nValentinian, being a man of a naturally ferocious disposition, when\r\nMaximin arrived, having no one to give him good advice or to restrain\r\nhim, proceeded, as if hurried on by a storm of winds and waves, to all\r\nkinds of cruel actions; so that when angry, his voice, his countenance,\r\nhis gait, and his complexion, were continually changing. And of this\r\npassionate intemperance there are many undoubted instances, of which it\r\nwill be sufficient to recount a few.\r\n\r\n3. A certain grown-up youth, of those called pages, having been\r\nappointed to take care of a Spartan hound which had been brought out for\r\nhunting, let him loose before the appointed moment, because the animal,\r\nin its efforts to escape, leaped upon him and bit him; and for this he\r\nwas beaten to death and buried the same day.\r\n\r\n4. The master of a workshop, who had brought the emperor an offering of\r\na breastplate most exquisitely polished, and who was therefore in\r\nexpectation of a reward, was ordered by him to be put to death because\r\nthe steel was of less weight than he considered requisite.... There was\r\na certain native, of Epirus, a priest of the Christian religion.[179]\r\n...\r\n\r\n5. Constantianus, the master of the stables, having ventured to change\r\na few of the horses, to select which he had been despatched to Sardinia,\r\nwas, by his order, stoned to death. Athanasius, a very popular\r\ncharacter, being suspected by him of some levity in the language he held\r\namong the common people, was sentenced to be burnt alive if he ever did\r\nanything of the kind again; and not long afterwards, being accused of\r\nhaving practised magic, he was actually burnt, no pardon being given\r\neven to one whose devices had often afforded the emperor great\r\namusement.\r\n\r\n6. Africanus was an advocate of great diligence, residing in Rome; he\r\nhad had the government of one province, and aspired to that of another.\r\nBut when Theodosius, the commander of the cavalry, supported his\r\npetition for such an office, the emperor answered him somewhat rudely,\r\n\"Away with you, O count, and change the head of the man who wishes to\r\nhave his province changed.\" And by this sentence a man of great\r\neloquence perished, only because, like many others, he wished for higher\r\npreferment.\r\n\r\n7. Claudian and Sallust were officers of the Jovian legion, who had\r\ngradually risen to the rank of tribunes; but they were accused by some\r\nman of the most despicable baseness of having said something in favour\r\nof Procopius when he aimed at the imperial power. And when a diligent\r\ninvestigation into this charge had proved ineffectual, the emperor gave\r\norders to the captains of the cavalry who had been employed in it, to\r\ncondemn Claudian to banishment, and to pass sentence of death upon\r\nSallust, promising that he would reprieve him as he was being led to\r\nexecution. The sentence was passed, as he commanded; but Sallust was not\r\nreprieved, nor was Claudian recalled from exile till after the death of\r\nValentinian.... After they had been exposed to frequent tortures.\r\n\r\n8. Nevertheless after so many persons had been put to the question, some\r\nof whom had even expired under the severity of their tortures, still no\r\ntraces of the alleged crimes could be discovered. In this affair some of\r\nthe body-guards, who had been sent to arrest certain persons, were, in a\r\nmost unusual manner, beaten to death.\r\n\r\n9. The mind shudders at the idea of recapitulating all that took place,\r\nand, indeed, dreads to do so, lest we should appear to make a business\r\nof pointing out the vices of an emperor who, in other respects, had many\r\ngood qualities. But this one circumstance may not be passed over in\r\nsilence nor suppressed, that he kept two ferocious she-bears who were\r\nused to eat men; and they had names, Golden Camel and Innocence, and\r\nthese beasts he took such care of that he had their dens close to his\r\nbedchamber; and appointed over them trusty keepers who were bound to\r\ntake especial care that the odious fury of these monsters should never\r\nbe checked. At last he had Innocence set free, after he had seen the\r\nburial of many corpses which she had torn to pieces, giving her the\r\nrange of the forests as a reward for her services.[180]\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n§ 1. These actions are the most undeniable proof of his habits and real\r\ncharacter; but even the most obstinate disparager of his disposition\r\ncannot deny him the praise of great ability, which never forgot the\r\ninterests of the state; especially when it is recollected, that perhaps\r\nit is a greater and more beneficial, as well as difficult, task to\r\ncontrol the barbarians by means of an army, than to repulse them. And\r\nwhen ... If any one of the enemy moved, he was seen from the\r\nwatch-towers and immediately overwhelmed.\r\n\r\n2. But among many other subjects of anxiety, the first and most\r\nimportant thing of all which was agitated, was to seize alive, either by\r\nforce or by trickery, as Julian had formerly taken Vadomarius,\r\nMacrianus, the king, who, through all the changes which had taken place,\r\nhad obtained a considerable increase of power, and was rising up against\r\nour people with full-grown strength: and after all the measures had been\r\ntaken which seemed required by the affair itself and the time, and when\r\nit had been learnt by information collected from deserters when the\r\naforesaid monarch could be seized before he expected anything of the\r\nkind, the emperor threw a bridge of boats across the Rhine with as much\r\nsecrecy as was possible, lest any one should interpose any obstacle to\r\nsuch a work.\r\n\r\n3. Severus, who was the commander of the infantry, led the van of the\r\narmy towards Wiesbaden; and then, reflecting on his scanty numbers,\r\nhalted in consternation; being afraid lest, as he should be quite\r\nunequal to resist them, he should be overwhelmed by the mass of the\r\nhostile army if it attacked him.\r\n\r\n4. And because he suspected that the dealers who brought slaves for\r\nsale, whom he found at that place by chance, would be likely to repair\r\nwith speed to the king to tell him what they had seen, he stripped them\r\nof all their merchandise, and then put them all to death.\r\n\r\n5. Our generals were now encouraged by the arrival of more troops; and\r\nspeedily contrived a temporary camp, because none of the baggage-beasts\r\nhad arrived, nor had any one a proper tent, except the emperor, for whom\r\none was constructed of carpets and tapestry. Then waiting a short time\r\non account of the darkness of the night, at daybreak the army quitted\r\nthe camp and proceeded onwards; being led by guides well acquainted with\r\nthe country. The cavalry, under Theodosius, its captain, was appointed\r\nto lead the way ... was inconvenienced by the great noise made by his\r\nmen; whom his repeated commands could not restrain from rapine and\r\nincendiarism. For the guards of the enemy being roused by the crackling\r\nof the flames, and suspecting what had happened, put the king on a light\r\ncarriage and carrying him off with great speed, hid him among the\r\ndefiles of the neighbouring mountains.\r\n\r\n6. Valentinian being defrauded of the glory of taking him, and that\r\nneither through any fault of his own or of his generals, but through the\r\ninsubordination of his soldiers, which was often the cause of great\r\nmisfortunes to the Roman state, laid waste all the enemy's country for\r\nfifty miles with fire and sword; and then returned dejected to Treves.\r\n\r\n7. Where like a lion raging for the loss of a deer or a goat and\r\nchamping with empty jaws, while fear was breaking and dividing the\r\nenemy, he proceeded to command the Bucenobantes, who are a tribe of the\r\nAllemanni opposite to Mayence, to elect Fraomarius as their king in\r\nplace of Macrianus. And, shortly afterwards, when a fresh invasion had\r\nentirely desolated that canton, he removed him to Britain, where he gave\r\nhim the authority of a tribune, and placed a number of the Allemanni\r\nunder his command, forming for him a division strong both in its\r\nnumbers and the excellence of its appointments. He also gave two other\r\nnobles of the same nation, by name Bitheridus and Hortarius, commands in\r\nhis army; of whom Hortarius, being betrayed by the information of\r\nFlorentius, Duke of Germany, who accused him of having written letters\r\nto Macrianus and the chieftains of the barbarians, containing language\r\nunfavourable to the republic, was put to the torture, and having been\r\ncompelled to confess the truth, was condemned to be burnt alive.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n§ 1. After this ... it seems best to relate these matters in one\r\nconnected narrative, lest the introduction of other affairs wholly\r\nunconnected with them, and which took place at a distance, should lead\r\nto confusion, and prevent the reader from acquiring a correct knowledge\r\nof these numerous and intricate affairs.\r\n\r\n2. Nubel, who had been the most powerful chieftain among the Mauritanian\r\nnations, died, and left several sons, some legitimate, others born of\r\nconcubines, of whom Zamma, a great favourite of the Count Romanus, was\r\nslain by his brother Firmus; and this deed gave rise to civil discords,\r\nand wars. For the count being exceedingly eager to avenge his death,\r\nmade formidable preparations for the destruction of his treacherous\r\nenemy. And as continual reports declared, most exceeding pains were\r\ntaken in the palace, that the despatches of Romanus, which contained\r\nmany most unfavourable statements respecting Firmus, should be received\r\nand read by the prince; while many circumstances strengthened their\r\ncredibility. And, on the other hand, that those documents which Firmus\r\nfrequently, for the sake of his own safety, endeavoured to lay before\r\nthe emperor by the agency of his friends, should be kept from his sight\r\nas long as possible, Remigius, a friend and relation of Romanus, and who\r\nwas at that time master of the offices, availed himself of other more\r\nimportant affairs which claimed the emperor's attention to declare that\r\nFirmus's papers were all unimportant and superfluous, only to be read at\r\na perfectly favourable opportunity.\r\n\r\n3. But when Firmus perceived that these intrigues were going on to keep\r\nhis defence out of sight, trembling for fear of the worst if all his\r\nexcuses should be passed over, and he himself be condemned as\r\ndisaffected and mischievous, and so be put to death, he revolted from\r\nthe emperor's authority, and aided ... in devastation.[181]\r\n\r\n4. Therefore, to prevent an implacable enemy from gaining strength by\r\nsuch an increase of force, Theodosius, the commander of the cavalry, was\r\nsent with a small body of the emperor's guards to crush him at once.\r\nTheodosius was an officer whose virtues and successes were at that time\r\nconspicuous above those of all other men: he resembled those ancient\r\nheroes, Domitius Corbulo, and Lusius; the first of whom was\r\ndistinguished by a great number of gallant achievements in the time of\r\nNero, and the latter of equal reputation under Trajan.\r\n\r\n5. Theodosius marched from Arles with favourable auspices, and having\r\ncrossed the sea with the fleet under his command so rapidly that no\r\nreport of his approach could arrive before himself, he reached the coast\r\nof Mauritania Sitifensis; that portion of the coast being called, by the\r\nnatives, Igilgitanum. There, by accident, he met Romanus, and addressing\r\nhim kindly, sent him to arrange the stations of the sentries and the\r\noutposts, without reproaching him for any of the matters for which he\r\nwas liable to blame.\r\n\r\n6. And when he had gone to the other province, Mauritania Cæsariensis,\r\nhe sent Gildo, the brother of Firmus and Maximus, to assist Vincentius,\r\nwho, as the deputy of Romanus, was the partner of his disloyal schemes\r\nand thefts.\r\n\r\n7. Accordingly, as soon as his soldiers arrived, who had been delayed by\r\nthe length of the sea voyage, he hastened to Sitifis; and gave orders to\r\nthe body-guards to keep Romanus and his attendants under surveillance.\r\nHe himself remained in the city, full of embarrassment and anxiety,\r\nworking many plans in his mind, while devising by what means or\r\ncontrivances he could conduct his soldiers who were accustomed to a cold\r\nclimate through a country parched up with heat; or how he could catch\r\nan enemy always on the alert and appearing when least expected, and who\r\nrelied more on surprises and ambuscades than a pitched battle.\r\n\r\n8. When news of these facts reached Firmus, first through vague reports,\r\nand subsequently by precise information, he, terrified at the approach\r\nof a general of tried valour, sent envoys and letters to him, confessing\r\nall he had done, and imploring pardon; asserting that it was not of his\r\nown accord that he had been driven on to an action which he knew to be\r\ncriminal, but that he had been goaded on by unjust treatment of a\r\nflagitious character, as he undertook to show.\r\n\r\n9. When his letters had been read, and when peace was promised him, and\r\nhostages received from him, Theodosius proceeded to the Pancharian\r\nstation to review the legions to which the protection of Africa was\r\nintrusted, and who had been ordered to assemble to meet him at that\r\nplace. There he encouraged the hopes of them all by confident yet\r\nprudent language; and then returned to Sitifis, having reinforced his\r\ntroops with some native soldiers; and, not being inclined to admit of\r\nany delay, he hastened to regain his camp.\r\n\r\n10. Among many other admirable qualities which he displayed, his\r\npopularity was immensely increased by an order which he issued,\r\nforbidding the army to demand supplies from the inhabitants of the\r\nprovince; and asserting, with a captivating confidence, that the\r\nharvests and granaries of the enemy were the magazines of the valour of\r\nour soldiers.\r\n\r\n11. Having arranged these matters in a way which caused great joy to the\r\nlandowners, he advanced to Tubusuptum, a town near Mons Ferratus, where\r\nhe rejected a second embassy of Firmus, because it had not brought with\r\nit the hostages, as had been provided before. From this place, having\r\nmade as careful an examination of everything as the time and place\r\npermitted, he proceeded by rapid marches to the Tyndenses and\r\nMassisenses; tribes equipped with light arms, under the command of\r\nMascizel and Dius, brothers of Firmus.\r\n\r\n12. When the enemy, being quick and active in all their movements, came\r\nin sight, after a fierce skirmish by a rapid interchange of missiles,\r\nboth sides engaged in a furious contest; and amid the groans of the\r\nwounded and dying were heard also the wailing and lamentations of\r\nbarbarian prisoners. When the battle was over, the territory for a great\r\ndistance was ravaged and wasted by fire.\r\n\r\n13. Among the havoc thus caused, the destruction of the farm of Petra,\r\nwhich was razed to the ground, and which had been originally built by\r\nSalmaces, its owner, a brother of Firmus, in such a manner as to\r\nresemble a town, was especially remarkable. The conqueror was elated at\r\nthis success, and with incredible speed proceeded to occupy the town of\r\nLamforctense, which was situated among the tribes already mentioned;\r\nhere he caused large stores of provisions to be accumulated, in order\r\nthat if, in his advance into the inland districts, he should find a\r\nscarcity of supplies, he might order them to be brought from this town,\r\nwhich would be at no great distance.\r\n\r\n14. In the mean time Mascizel, having recruited his forces by\r\nauxiliaries which he had procured from the tribes on the borders,\r\nventured on a pitched battle with our army, in which his men were\r\nrouted, and a great portion of them slain, while he himself was with\r\ndifficulty saved from death by the speed of his horse.\r\n\r\n15. Firmus, being weakened by the losses he had sustained in two\r\nbattles, and in great perplexity, in order to leave no expedient\r\nuntried, sent some priests of the Christian religion with the hostages,\r\nas ambassadors to implore peace. They were received kindly, and having\r\npromised supplies of food for our soldiers, as they were commissioned to\r\ndo, they brought back a propitious answer. And then, sending before him\r\na present, Firmus himself went with confidence to meet the Roman\r\ngeneral, mounted on a horse fitted for any emergency. When he came near\r\nTheodosius, he was awe-struck at the brilliancy of the standards, and\r\nthe terrible countenance of the general himself; and leapt from his\r\nhorse, and with neck bowed down almost to the ground, he, with tears,\r\nlaid all the blame on his own rashness, and entreated pardon and peace.\r\n\r\n16. He was received with a kiss, since such treatment of him appeared\r\nadvantageous to the republic; and being now full of joyful hope, he\r\nsupplied the army with provisions in abundance; and having left some of\r\nhis own relations as hostages, he departed in order, as he promised, to\r\nrestore those prisoners whom he had taken at the first beginning of\r\nthese disturbances. And two days afterwards, without any delay, he\r\nrestored the town of Icosium (of the founders of which we have already\r\nspoken), also the military standards, the crown belonging to the priest,\r\nand all the other things which he had taken, as he had been commanded to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\n17. Leaving this place, our general, advancing by long marches, reached\r\nTiposa, where, with great elation, he gave answers to the envoys of the\r\nMazices, who had combined with Firmus, and now in a suppliant tone\r\nimplored pardon, replying to their entreaties that he would at once\r\nmarch against them as perfidious enemies.\r\n\r\n18. When he had thus cowed them by the fear of impending danger, and had\r\ncommanded them to return to their own country, he proceeded onwards to\r\nCæsarea, a city formerly of great wealth and importance, of the origin\r\nof which we have given a full account in our description of Africa. When\r\nhe reached it, and saw that nearly the whole of it had been destroyed by\r\nextensive conflagrations, and that the flint stones of the streets were\r\ncovered with ashes, he ordered the first and second legions to be\r\nstationed there for a time, that they might clear away the heaps of\r\ncinders and ashes, and keep guard there to prevent a fresh attack of the\r\nbarbarians from repeating this devastation.\r\n\r\n19. When accurate intelligence of these events had arrived, the\r\ngovernors of the province and the tribune Vincentius issued forth from\r\nthe places of concealment in which they had been lying, and came with\r\nspeed and confidence to the general. He saw and received them with joy,\r\nand, while still at Cæsarea, having accurately inquired into every\r\ncircumstance, he found that Firmus, while assuming the disguise of an\r\nally and a suppliant, was secretly planning how, like a sudden tempest,\r\nto overwhelm his army while unprepared for any such danger.\r\n\r\n20. On this he quitted Cæsarea, and went to the town of Sugabarritanum,\r\nwhich is on the slope of Mount Transcellensis. There he found the\r\ncavalry of the fourth cohort of archers, who had revolted to the\r\nrebels, and in order to show himself content with lenient punishments,\r\nhe degraded them all to the lowest class of the service, and ordered\r\nthem, and a portion of the infantry of the Constantian legion, to come\r\nto Tigaviæ with their tribunes, one of whom was the man who, for want of\r\na diadem, had placed a neck-chain on the head of Firmus.\r\n\r\n21. While these events were proceeding, Gildo and Maximus returned, and\r\nbrought with them Bellenes, one of the princes of the Mazices, and\r\nFericius, prefect of that nation, both of whom had espoused the faction\r\nof the disturber of the public peace, leading them forth in chains.\r\n\r\n22. When this order had been executed, Theodosius himself came forth\r\nfrom his camp at daybreak, and on seeing those men surrounded by his\r\narmy, said, \"What, my trusty comrades, do you think ought to be done to\r\nthese nefarious traitors?\" And then, in compliance with the acclamations\r\nof the whole army, who demanded that their treason should be expiated by\r\ntheir blood, he, according to the ancient fashion, handed over those of\r\nthem who had served in the Constantian legion to the soldiers to be put\r\nto death by them. The officers of the archers he sentenced to lose their\r\nhands, and the rest he condemned to death, in imitation of Curio, that\r\nmost vigorous and severe general, who by this kind of punishment crushed\r\nthe ferocity of the Dardanians, when it was reviving like the Lernæan\r\nhydra.\r\n\r\n23. But malignant detractors, though they praise the ancient deed,\r\nvituperate this one as terrible and inhuman, affirming that the\r\nDardanians[182] were implacable enemies, and therefore justly suffered\r\nthe punishment inflicted on them; but that those soldiers, who belonged\r\nto our own standards, ought to have been corrected with more lenity, for\r\nfalling into one single error. But we will remind these cavillers, of\r\nwhat perhaps they know already, namely, that this cohort was not only an\r\nenemy by its own conduct, but also by the example which it set to\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n24. He also commanded Bellenes and Fericius, who have been mentioned\r\nabove, and whom Gildo brought with him, to be put to death; and likewise\r\nCurandius, a tribune of the archers, because he had always been\r\nbackward in engaging the enemy himself, and had never been willing to\r\nencourage his men to fight. And he did this in recollection of the\r\nprinciple laid down by Cicero, that \"salutary vigour is better than an\r\nempty appearance of clemency.\"\r\n\r\n25. Leaving Sugabarri, he came to a town called Gallonatis, surrounded\r\nby a strong wall, and a secure place of refuge for the Moors, which, as\r\nsuch, he destroyed with his battering-rams. And having slain all the\r\ninhabitants, and levelled the walls, he advanced along the foot of Mount\r\nAncorarius to the fortress of Tingetanum, where the Mazices were all\r\ncollected in one solid body. He at once attacked them, and they\r\nencountered him with arrows and missiles of all kinds as thick as hail.\r\n\r\n26. The battle proceeded for some time vigorously on both sides, till at\r\nlast the Mazices, though a hardy and warlike race, being unable to\r\nwithstand the fury of our men and the shock of their arms, after\r\nsustaining heavy loss, fled in every direction in disgraceful panic; and\r\nas they fled they were put to the sword in great numbers, with the\r\nexception only of those who, contriving to make their escape,\r\nafterwards, by their humble supplications, obtained the pardon which the\r\ntimes permitted to be granted to them.\r\n\r\n27. Their leader Suggena, who succeeded Romanus, was sent into\r\nMauritania Sitifensis to establish other garrisons necessary to prevent\r\nthat province from being overrun; and he himself, elated by his recent\r\nachievements, marched against the nation of the Musones, who, from a\r\nconsciousness of the ravages and murders of which they had been guilty,\r\nhad joined the party of Firmus, hoping that he would soon obtain the\r\nchief authority.\r\n\r\n28. Having advanced some distance, he found, near the town of Addense,\r\nthat a number of tribes, who, though differing from each other in\r\nmanners and language, were all animated with one feeling, in fomenting\r\nthe outbreaks of terrible wars, being urged on and encouraged by the\r\nhope of great rewards from a sister of Firmus, named Cyria; who being\r\nvery rich, and full of feminine resolution, was resolved to make a great\r\neffort to help her brother.\r\n\r\n29. Therefore Theodosius, fearing to become involved in a war to which\r\nhis forces were unequal, and that if he with his small force (for he had\r\nbut three thousand five hundred men) should engage with an immense\r\nmultitude, he should lose his whole army, at first hesitating between\r\nthe shame of retreating and his wish to fight, gradually fell back a\r\nlittle; but presently was compelled by the overpowering mass of the\r\nbarbarians to retire altogether.\r\n\r\n30. The barbarians were exceedingly elated at this event, and pursued\r\nhim with great obstinacy.... Being compelled by necessity to fight, he\r\nwould have lost all his army and his own life, had not these tumultuous\r\ntribes, the moment they saw a troop of the Mazican auxiliaries, with a\r\nfew Roman soldiers in their front, fancied that a numerous division was\r\nadvancing to charge them, and in consequence taking to flight, opened to\r\nour men a way of escape which was previously shut against them.\r\n\r\n31. Theodosius now drew off his army in safety; and when he had reached\r\na town called Mazucanum, he found there a number of deserters, some of\r\nwhom he burnt alive, and others he mutilated after the fashion of the\r\narchers whose hands had been cut off. He then proceeded towards Tipata,\r\nwhich he reached in the course of February.\r\n\r\n32. There he stayed some time deliberating, like that old delayer,\r\nFabius, on the circumstances around him, desiring to subdue the enemy,\r\nwho was not only warlike, but so active as usually to keep out of\r\nbowshot, rather by manoeuvres and skill than by hazardous engagements.\r\n\r\n33. Still he from time to time sent out envoys, skilled in the arts of\r\npersuasion, to the surrounding tribes, the Basuræ, the Cautauriani, the\r\nAnastomates, the Cafaves, the Davares, and other people in their\r\nneighbourhood, trying to bring them over to our alliance, either by\r\npresents, threats, or by promises of pardon for past violence ...\r\nseeking by delays and intrigues to crush an enemy who offered so stout a\r\nresistance to his attacks, just as Pompey in times past had subdued\r\nMithridates.\r\n\r\n34. On this account Firmus, avoiding immediate destruction, although he\r\nwas strengthened by a large body of troops, abandoned the army which he\r\nhad collected by a lavish expenditure of money, and as the darkness of\r\nnight afforded a chance of concealment, he fled to the Caprarian\r\nmountains, which were at a great distance, and from their precipitous\r\ncharacter inaccessible.\r\n\r\n35. On his clandestine departure, his army also dispersed, being broken\r\nup into small detachments without any leader, and thus afforded our men\r\nan opportunity of attacking their camp. That was soon plundered, and all\r\nwho resisted were put to the sword, or else taken prisoners; and then,\r\nhaving devastated the greater portion of the country, our wise general\r\nappointed prefects of tried loyalty as governors of the different tribes\r\nthrough which he passed.\r\n\r\n36. The traitor was thrown into consternation by the unexpected boldness\r\nof his pursuit, and with the escort of only a few servants, hoping to\r\nsecure his safety by the rapidity of his movements, in order to have\r\nnothing to impede his flight, threw away all the valuable baggage which\r\nhe had taken with him. His wife, exhausted with continual toil....\r\n\r\n37. Theodosius ... showing mercy to none of them, having refreshed his\r\nsoldiers by a supply of better food, and gratified them by a\r\ndistribution of pay, defeated the Capracienses and Abanni, who were the\r\nnext tribes to them, in some unimportant skirmishes, and then advanced\r\nwith great speed to the town of ... and having received certain\r\nintelligence that the barbarians had already occupied the hills, and\r\nwere spread over the precipitous and broken ground to a great height, so\r\nthat they were quite inaccessible to any but natives who were intimately\r\nacquainted with the whole country, he retired, giving the enemy an\r\nopportunity by a truce, short as it was, to receive an important\r\nreinforcement from the Ethiopians in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n38. Then having assembled all their united forces, they rushed on to\r\nbattle with threatening shouts, and an utter disregard of their\r\nindividual safety, compelling him to retreat, full of consternation at\r\nthe apparently countless numbers of their army. But soon the courage of\r\nhis men revived, and he returned, bringing with him vast supplies, and\r\nwith his troops in a dense column, and brandishing their shields with\r\nformidable gestures, he again engaged the enemy in close combat.\r\n\r\n39. The barbarians rattled their arms in a savage manner, and our\r\nbattalions, with equal rage, pushed on, they also rattling their shields\r\nagainst their knees. Still the general, like a cautious and prudent\r\nwarrior, aware of the scantiness of his numbers, advanced boldly with\r\nhis army in battle array, till he came to a point, at which he turned\r\noff, though still preserving an undaunted front, towards the city of\r\nContensis, where Firmus had placed the prisoners whom he had taken from\r\nus, as in a remote and safe fortress. He recovered them all, and\r\ninflicted severe punishment, according to his custom, on the traitors\r\namong the prisoners, and also on the guards of Firmus.\r\n\r\n40. While he was thus successful, through the protection of the Supreme\r\nDeity, he received correct intelligence from one of his scouts that\r\nFirmus had fled to the tribe of the Isaflenses. He at once entered their\r\nterritory to require that he should be given up, with his brother\r\nMazuca, and the rest of his relations: and on being refused, he declared\r\nwar against the nation.\r\n\r\n41. And after a fierce battle, in which the barbarians displayed\r\nextraordinary courage and ferocity, he threw his army into a solid\r\ncircle; and then the Isaflenses were so completely overpowered by the\r\nweight of our battalions pressing on them that numbers were slain; and\r\nFirmus himself, gallantly as he behaved, after exposing himself to\r\nimminent danger by the rashness of his courage, put spurs to his horse,\r\nand fled; his horse being accustomed to make his way with great speed\r\nover the most rocky and precipitous paths. But his brother Mazuca was\r\ntaken prisoner, mortally wounded.\r\n\r\n42. It was intended to send him to Cæsarea, where he had left behind him\r\nmany records of his atrocious cruelties; but his wounds reopened, and he\r\ndied. So his head was cut off, and (his body being left behind) was\r\nconveyed to that city, where it was received with great joy by all who\r\nsaw it.\r\n\r\n43. After this our noble general inflicted most severe punishment, as\r\njustice required, on the whole nation of the Isaflenses, which had\r\nresisted till it was thus subdued in war. And he burnt alive one of the\r\nmost influential of the citizens, named Evasius, and his son Florus, and\r\nseveral others, who were convicted on undeniable evidence of having\r\naided the great disturber of tranquillity by their secret counsels.\r\n\r\n44. From thence Theodosius proceeded into the interior, and with great\r\nresolution attacked the tribe of the Jubileni, to which he heard that\r\nNubel, the father of Firmus, belonged; but presently he halted, being\r\nchecked by the height of the mountains, and their winding defiles. And\r\nthough he had once attacked the enemy, and opened himself a further road\r\nby slaying a great number of them, still, fearing the high precipices as\r\nplaces pre-eminently adapted for ambuscades, he withdrew, and led back\r\nhis army in safety to a fortress called Audiense, where the Jesalenses,\r\na warlike tribe, came over to him, voluntarily promising to furnish him\r\nwith reinforcements and provisions.\r\n\r\n45. Our noble general, exulting in this and similarly glorious\r\nachievements, now made the greatest efforts to overtake the original\r\ndisturber of tranquillity himself, and therefore having halted for some\r\ntime near a fortress named Medianum, he planned various schemes through\r\nwhich he hoped to procure that Firmus should be given up to him.\r\n\r\n46. And while he was directing anxious thoughts and deep sagacity to\r\nthis object, he heard that he had again gone back to the Isaflenses; on\r\nwhich, as before, without any delay, he marched against them with all\r\npossible speed. Their king, whose name was Igmazen, a man of great\r\nreputation in that country, and celebrated also for his riches, advanced\r\nwith boldness to meet him, and addressed him thus, \"To what country do\r\nyou belong, and with what object have you come hither? Answer me.\"\r\nTheodosius, with firm mind and stern looks, replied, \"I am a lieutenant\r\nof Valentinian, the master of the whole world, sent hither to destroy a\r\nmurderous robber; and unless you at once surrender him, as the\r\ninvincible emperor has commanded, you also, and the nation of which you\r\nare king, will be entirely destroyed.\" Igmazen, on receiving this\r\nanswer, heaped a number of insulting epithets on our general, and then\r\nretired full of rage and indignation.\r\n\r\n47. And the next morning at daybreak the two armies, breathing terrible\r\nthreats against each other, advanced to engage in battle: nearly twenty\r\nthousand barbarians constituted the front of their army, with very large\r\nreserves posted behind, out of sight, with the intention that they\r\nshould steal forward gradually, and hem in our battalions with their\r\nvast and unexpected numbers. These were also supported by a great number\r\nof auxiliaries of the Jesalenian tribes, whom we have mentioned as\r\nhaving promised reinforcements and supplies to ourselves.\r\n\r\n48. On the other side, the Roman army, though scanty in numbers,\r\nnevertheless being full of natural courage, and elated by their past\r\nvictories, formed into dense columns, and joining their shields firmly\r\ntogether, in the fashion of a testudo, planted their feet firmly in\r\nsteady resistance; and from sunrise to the close of day the battle was\r\nprotracted. A little before evening Firmus was seen mounted on a tall\r\nhorse, expanding his scarlet cloak in order to attract the notice of his\r\nsoldiers, whom he was exciting with a loud voice at once to deliver up\r\nTheodosius, calling him a ferocious and cruel man--an inventor of\r\nmerciless punishments--as the only means of delivering themselves from\r\nthe miseries which he was causing them.\r\n\r\n49. This unexpected address only provoked some of our men to fight with\r\nmore vigour than ever, but there were others whom it seduced to desert\r\nour ranks. Therefore when the stillness of night arrived, and the\r\ncountry became enveloped in thick darkness, Theodosius returned to the\r\nfortress of Duodiense, and, recognizing those soldiers who had been\r\npersuaded by fear and Firmus's speech to quit the fight, he put them all\r\nto death by different modes of execution; of some he cut off the right\r\nhands, others he burnt alive.\r\n\r\n50. And conducting himself with ceaseless care and vigilance, he routed\r\na division of the barbarians who, though afraid to show themselves by\r\nday, ventured, after the moon had set, to make an attempt upon his camp:\r\nsome of those who advanced further than their comrades he took\r\nprisoners. Departing from this place, he made a forced march through\r\nby-roads to attack the Jesalensians, who had shown themselves disloyal\r\nand unfaithful. He could not obtain any supplies from their country, but\r\nhe ravaged it, and reduced it to complete desolation. Then he passed\r\nthrough the towns of Mauritania and Cæsarensis, and returned to Sitifis,\r\nwhere he put to the torture Castor and Martinianus, who had been the\r\naccomplices of Romanus in his rapine and other crimes, and afterwards\r\nburnt them.\r\n\r\n51. After this the war with the Isaflenses was renewed; and in the\r\nfirst conflict, after the barbarians had been routed with heavy loss,\r\ntheir king Igmazen, who had hitherto been accustomed to be victorious,\r\nagitated by fears of the present calamity, and thinking that all his\r\nalliances would be destroyed, and that he should have no hope left in\r\nlife if he continued to resist, with all the cunning and secrecy that he\r\ncould, fled by himself from the battle; and reaching Theodosius,\r\nbesought him in a suppliant manner to desire Masilla, the chief\r\nmagistrate of the Mazices, to come to him.\r\n\r\n52. When that noble had been sent to him as he requested, he employed\r\nhim as his agent to advise the general, as a man by nature constant and\r\nresolute in his plans, that the way to accomplish his purpose would be\r\nto press his countrymen with great vigour, and, by incessant fighting,\r\nstrike terror into them; as, though they were keen partisans of Firmus,\r\nthey were nevertheless wearied out by repeated disasters.\r\n\r\n53. Theodosius adopted this advice, and, by battle after battle, so\r\ncompletely broke the spirits of the Isaflenses, that they fell away like\r\nsheep, and Firmus again secretly escaped, and hiding himself for a long\r\ntime in out-of-the-way places and retreats, till at last, while\r\ndeliberating on a further flight, he was seized by Igmazen, and put in\r\nconfinement.\r\n\r\n54. And since he had learnt from Masilla the plans which had been\r\nagitated in secret, he at last came to reflect that in so extreme a\r\nnecessity there was but one remedy remaining, and he determined to\r\ntrample under foot the love of life by a voluntary death; and having\r\ndesignedly filled himself with wine till he became stupefied, when, in\r\nthe silence of the night, his keepers were sunk in profound slumber, he,\r\nfully awake from dread of the misfortune impending over him, left his\r\nbed with noiseless steps, and crawling on his hands and feet, conveyed\r\nhimself to a distance, and then, having found a rope which chance\r\nprovided for the end of his life, he fastened it to a nail which was\r\nfixed in the wall, and hanging himself, escaped the protracted\r\nsufferings of torture.\r\n\r\n55. Igmazen was vexed at this, lamenting that he was thus robbed of his\r\nglory, because it had not been granted to him to conduct this rebel\r\nalive to the Roman camp; and so, having received a pledge of the state\r\nfor his own safety, through the intervention of Masilla, he placed the\r\nbody of the dead man on a camel, and when he arrived at the camp of the\r\nRoman army, which was pitched near the fortress of Subicarense, he\r\ntransferred it to a pack-horse, and offered it to Theodosius, who\r\nreceived it with exultation.\r\n\r\n56. And Theodosius having assembled a crowd of soldiers and citizens,\r\nand having asked them whether they recognized the face of the corpse,\r\nlearnt by their answers that there was no question at all that it was\r\nthe man; after this he stayed there a short time, and then returned to\r\nSitifis in great triumph, where he was received with joyful acclamations\r\nof the people of every age and rank.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n§ 1. While Theodosius was thus exerting himself, and toiling in\r\nMauritania and Africa, the nation of the Quadi was roused to make a\r\nsudden movement. It was a nation now not very formidable, but one which\r\nhad formerly enjoyed vast renown for its warlike genius and power, as\r\nits achievements prove, some of which were distinguished for the\r\nrapidity, as well as for the greatness, of their success; instances\r\nare:--Aquileia, which was besieged by them and the Marcomanni;\r\nOpitergium, which was destroyed by them, and many other bloody successes\r\nwhich were gained in that rapid campaign when the Julian Alps were\r\npassed, and that illustrious emperor Marcus, of whom we have already\r\nspoken, was hardly able to offer them any resistance. And indeed they\r\nhad, for barbarians, just ground of complaint.\r\n\r\n2. For Valentinian, who from the beginning of his reign had been full of\r\na resolution to fortify his frontier, which was a glorious decision, but\r\none carried too far in this case, ordered a fortress capable of\r\ncontaining a strong garrison to be constructed on the south side of the\r\nriver Danube, in the very territories of the Quadi, as if they were\r\nsubject to the Roman authority. The natives, being very indignant at\r\nthis, and anxious for their own rights and safety, at first contented\r\nthemselves with trying to avert the evil by an embassy and\r\nexpostulations.\r\n\r\n3. But Maximin, always eager for any wickedness, and unable to bridle\r\nhis natural arrogance, which was now increased by the pride which he\r\nfelt in his rank as prefect, reproached Equitius, who at that time was\r\nthe commander of the forces in Illyricum, as careless and inactive,\r\nbecause the work, which it was ordered should be carried on with all\r\nspeed, was not yet finished. And he added, as a man guided only by zeal\r\nfor the common good, that if the rank of Duke of Valeria were only\r\nconferred on his own little son, Marcellianus, the fortification would\r\nbe soon completed without any more pretexts for delay. Both his wishes\r\nwere presently granted.\r\n\r\n4. Marcellianus received the promotion thus suggested, and set out to\r\ntake possession of his government; and when he reached it, being full of\r\nuntimely arrogance, as might be expected from the son of such a father,\r\nwithout attempting to conciliate those whom false dreams of gain had\r\ncaused to quit their native land, he applied himself to the work which\r\nhad been recently begun, and had only been suspended to afford an\r\nopportunity for the inhabitants to present petitions against it.\r\n\r\n5. Lastly, when their king Gabinius requested, in a most moderate tone,\r\nthat no innovations might be made, he as if intending to assent to his\r\npetition, with feigned courtesy invited him and some other persons to a\r\nbanquet; and then as he was departing after the entertainment,\r\nunsuspicious of treachery, he caused him, in infamous violation of the\r\nsacred rights of hospitality, to be murdered.\r\n\r\n6. The report of so atrocious an act was speedily spread abroad, and\r\nroused the indignation of the Quadi and other surrounding tribes, who,\r\nbewailing the death of the king, collected together and sent forth\r\npredatory bands, which crossed the Danube; and when no hostilities were\r\nlooked for, attacked the people who were occupied in the fields about\r\nthe harvest; and having slain the greater portion of them, carried off\r\nall the survivors to their own country with a great booty of different\r\nkinds of cattle.\r\n\r\n7. And at that time an inexpiable atrocity was very near being\r\ncommitted, which would have been reckoned among the most disgraceful\r\ndisasters which ever happened to the Roman state, for the daughter of\r\nConstantius had a narrow escape of being taken prisoner as she was at\r\ndinner in a hotel called the Pistrensian, when on her way to be married\r\nto Gratian: and she was only saved by the promptitude of Messala the\r\ngovernor of the province, who, aided by the favour of the propitious\r\nDeity, placed her in a carriage belonging to him as governor, and\r\nconducted her back with all possible speed to Sirmium, a distance of\r\nabout twenty-six miles.\r\n\r\n8. By this fortunate chance the royal virgin was delivered from the\r\nperil of miserable slavery; and if she had been taken and her captors\r\nhad refused to ransom her, it would have been the cause of terrible\r\ndisasters to the republic. After this the Quadi in conjunction with the\r\nSarmatians, extended their ravages further (since both these tribes were\r\naddicted beyond measure to plunder and robbery), carrying off, men,\r\nwomen, and cattle, and exulting in the ashes of burnt villas, and in the\r\nmisery of the murdered inhabitants, whom they fell upon unexpectedly and\r\nslaughtered without mercy.\r\n\r\n9. All the neighbouring districts were filled with apprehension of\r\nsimilar evils, and Probus, the prefect of the prætorium, who was at that\r\ntime at Sirmium, a man wholly unexperienced in war, being panic-struck\r\nwith the calamitous appearance of these new occurrences, and scarcely\r\nable to raise his eyes for fear, was for a long time wavering in doubt\r\nwhat to do. At first he prepared some swift horses and resolved to fly\r\nthe next night; but afterwards, taking advice from some one who gave him\r\nsafer counsel, he stayed where he was, but without doing anything.\r\n\r\n10. For he had been assured that all those who were within the walls of\r\nthe city would immediately follow him, with the intention of concealing\r\nthemselves in suitable hiding-places; and if that had been done, the\r\ncity, left without defenders, would have fallen into the hands of the\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\n11. Presently, after his terror had been a little moderated, he applied\r\nhimself with some activity to do what was most pressing; he cleared out\r\nthe fosses which were choked up with ruins; he repaired the greater\r\nportion of the walls which, through the security engendered by a long\r\npeace, had been neglected, and had fallen into decay, and raised them\r\nagain to the height of lofty towers, devoting himself zealously to the\r\nwork of building. In this way the work was speedily completed, because\r\nhe found that the sums which some time before had been collected for the\r\nerection of a theatre were sufficient for the purpose he was now\r\npressing forward. And to this prudent measure he added another of like\r\nprecaution, in summoning a cohort of archer cavalry from the nearest\r\nstation, that it might be at hand to resist a siege should any take\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n12. By these barriers, as they may be called, the barbarians were forced\r\nto abandon their design of besieging the city, since they were not\r\nskilful in contests of this kind, and were also hampered by the burden\r\nof their booty; accordingly they turned aside to pursue Equitius. And\r\nwhen, from the information given them by their prisoners, they learnt\r\nthat he had retired to the most remote part of Valeria, they hastened\r\nthither by forced marches, gnashing their teeth, and determined on his\r\ndeath, because they believed that it was through his means their\r\ninnocent king had been circumvented.\r\n\r\n13. And as they were hastening onwards with impetuous and vengeful\r\nspeed, they were met by two legions, the Pannonian and the Moesian,\r\nboth of approved valour, who, if they had acted in harmony, must\r\nunquestionably have come off victorious. But while they were hastening\r\nonward to attack the barbarians separately, a quarrel arose between them\r\non the subject of their honour and dignity, which impeded all their\r\noperations.\r\n\r\n14. And when intelligence of this dissension reached the Sarmatians, who\r\nare a most sagacious people, they, without waiting for any regular\r\nsignal of battle, attacked the Moesians first; and while the soldiers,\r\nbeing surprised and in disorder, were slowly making ready their arms,\r\nmany of them were killed; on which the barbarians with increased\r\nconfidence attacked the Pannonians, and broke their line also; and when\r\nthe line of battle was once disordered, they redoubled their efforts,\r\nand would have destroyed almost all of them, if some had not saved\r\nthemselves from the danger of death by a precipitate flight.\r\n\r\n15. Amid these calamitous inflictions of adverse fortune, Theodosius the\r\nyounger, Duke of Moesia, then in the first bloom of youth, but\r\nafterwards a prince of the highest reputation, in many encounters\r\ndefeated and vanquished the Free Sarmatians (so called to distinguish\r\nthem from their rebellious slaves), who had invaded our frontier on the\r\nother side, till he exhausted them by his repeated victories; and with\r\nsuch vigour did he crush the assembled crowds combined to resist his\r\narms, that he glutted the very birds and beasts with the blood of the\r\nvast numbers justly slain.\r\n\r\n16. Those who remained having lost all their pride and spirit, fearing\r\nlest a general of such evident promptitude and courage should rout or\r\ndestroy these invading battalions on the very edge of his frontier, or\r\nlay ambuscades for them in the recesses of the woods, made from time to\r\ntime many vain attempts to escape, and at last, discarding all\r\nconfidence in battle, they begged indulgence and pardon for their past\r\nhostility. And being thoroughly subdued, they did nothing for some time\r\ncontrary to the treaty of peace, being more especially terrified because\r\na strong force of Gallic soldiers had come to the defence of Illyricum.\r\n\r\n17. While these events were agitating the empire, and while Claudius was\r\nprefect of the Eternal City, the Tiber, which intersects its walls, and\r\nwhich, after receiving the waters of many drains and copious streams,\r\nfalls into the Tyrrhenian Sea, overflowed its banks, in consequence of\r\nan abundance of rain, and extending to a size beyond that of a river,\r\noverwhelmed almost everything with its flood.\r\n\r\n18. All those parts of the city which lie in the plain were under water,\r\nand nothing reared its head above but the hills and other spots of\r\nrising ground, which seemed like islands, out of the reach of present\r\ndanger. And, as the vastness of the inundation permitted of no departure\r\nin any direction to save the multitude from dying of famine, great\r\nquantities of provisions were brought in barges and boats. But when the\r\nbad weather abated, and the river which had burst its bounds returned to\r\nits accustomed channel, the citizens discarded all fear, and apprehended\r\nno inconvenience for the future.\r\n\r\n19. Claudius, as a prefect, conducted himself very quietly, nor was any\r\nsedition in his time provoked by any real grievance. He also repaired\r\nmany ancient buildings; and among his improvements he built a large\r\ncolonnade contiguous to the bath of Agrippa, and gave it the name of The\r\nColonnade of Success, because a temple bearing that title is close to\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n[176] For an account of this incantation, see Gibbon, Bohn's edition\r\nvol. iii., p. 75, note.\r\n\r\n[177] The lines of Theognis are--\r\n\r\n  \"+Andr' agathon peniê pantôn damnêsi malista\r\n    Kai gêrôs poliou Kyrne, kai êpialou\r\n  Hên dê chrê pheugonta kai es megakêtea ponton\r\n    Rhiptein, kai petrôn Kyrne, kat' êlibatôn.+\"\r\n\r\nWhich may be thus translated:--\r\n\r\n  \"Want crushes a brave man far worse than age,\r\n  O Cyrnus! or than fever's fiery rage;\r\n  Flee, should thy flight beneath the greedy wave,\r\n  Or from steep rocks but ope a milder grave.\"\r\n\r\n[178] For the purposes of divination.\r\n\r\n[179] This sentence is so mutilated as to be unintelligible, but is\r\nfilled up by conjecture, founded on a knowledge of the facts, thus: \"who\r\nwas executed because he had not given up Octavian, who had been formerly\r\nproconsul of Africa, and who had taken refuge in his house when accused\r\nof some crime.\"\r\n\r\n[180] The end of this chapter also is lost, as are one or two passages\r\nin the beginning of Chapter IV.\r\n\r\n[181] Manuscript imperfect.\r\n\r\n[182] The Dardanians were a Thracian tribe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK XXX.\r\n\r\nARGUMENT.\r\n\r\n     I.

While all these difficulties and disturbances had been caused by\r\nthe perfidy of the Duke Marcellianus, in treacherously murdering the\r\nking of the Quadi, a terrible crime was committed in the East, where\r\nPara, king of Armenia was also murdered by secret treachery; the\r\noriginal cause of which wicked action we have ascertained to be this:--\r\n\r\n2. Some men of perverse temperament, who delighted in public misfortune,\r\nhad concocted a number of accusations against this prince for acts which\r\nthey imputed to him even when scarcely grown up, and had exaggerated\r\nthem to Valens. Among these men was the Duke Terentius, a man who always\r\nwalked about with a downcast melancholy look, and throughout his life\r\nwas an unwearied sower of discord.\r\n\r\n3. He, having formed a combination with a few people of Para's nation,\r\nwhom a consciousness of their own crimes had filled with fear, was\r\ncontinually harping in his letters to the court on the deaths of Cylax\r\nand Artabannes; adding also that this same young king was full of\r\nhaughtiness in all his conduct, and that he behaved with excessive\r\ncruelty to his subjects.\r\n\r\n4. In consequence of these letters, Para, as if it were intended that he\r\nshould become a partaker in a treaty of which existing circumstances\r\nrequired ratification, was invited to court with all the ceremony to\r\nwhich he was entitled as a king, and then was detained at Tarsus in\r\nCilicia, with a show of honour, without being able to procure permission\r\nto approach the emperor's camp, or to learn why his arrival had been so\r\neagerly pressed; since on this point all around him preserved a rigid\r\nsilence. At last, however, by means of private information, he learnt\r\nthat Terentius was endeavouring by letter to persuade the Roman\r\nsovereign to send without delay another king to Armenia; lest, out of\r\nhatred to Para, and a knowledge of what they had to expect if he\r\nreturned among them, his nation, which at present was friendly to us,\r\nshould revolt to the Persians, who had long been eager to reduce them\r\nunder their power either by violence, fear, or flattery.\r\n\r\n5. Para, reflecting on this warning, foreboded grievous mischief for\r\nhimself; and being a man of forethought and contrivance, as he could not\r\nperceive any means of safety, except by a speedy departure, by the\r\nadvice of his most trusty friends he collected a body of 300 persons who\r\nhad accompanied him from his own country, and with horses selected for\r\nespecial speed, acting as men are wont to do under the pressure of\r\ngreat terror and perplexity, that is to say, with more boldness than\r\nprudence; late one afternoon he started boldly forth at the head of his\r\nescort, formed in one solid body.\r\n\r\n6. And when the governor of the province, having received information\r\nfrom the officer who kept the gate, came with prompt energy and found\r\nhim in the suburb, he earnestly entreated him to remain; but finding\r\nthat he could not prevail upon him, he quitted him, for fear of his own\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n7. And not long afterwards Para, with his escort, turned back upon the\r\nlegion which was pursuing him and on the point of overtaking him, and\r\npouring arrows upon them as thick as sparks of fire, though designedly\r\nmissing them, he put them to flight, filling them, tribune and all, with\r\ncomplete consternation, so that they returned to the city with greater\r\nspeed than they left it.\r\n\r\n8. After this, Para being released from all fear, continued his\r\nlaborious and rapid journey for two days and two nights, till he reached\r\nthe Euphrates; where, for want of boats, he was unable to pass the\r\nriver, which at that place is full of strong currents and too deep to be\r\nforded. His men, not being skilful swimmers, were afraid to trust\r\nthemselves to the stream, and he himself showed more hesitation than any\r\nof them; indeed he would have halted there altogether, if while every\r\none was suggesting one plan or another, he had not at last hit upon the\r\nfollowing expedient, which seemed the safest in this emergency.\r\n\r\n9. They took a number of little beds which they found in the\r\nneighbouring houses, and supported them each on two bladders, of which\r\nthere were plenty at hand in the vineyards. And then he and his nobles\r\nplaced themselves each on a bed, leading their horses after them, and so\r\nfloated down and across the stream; by which contrivance, after extreme\r\ndanger, they at last reached the opposite bank.\r\n\r\n10. All the rest swam their horses, and though they were terribly tossed\r\nabout and often almost sunk by the eddying stream, still, though much\r\nexhausted by their wetting, they also reached the opposite bank; when\r\nhaving rested for a short time and refreshed themselves, they proceeded\r\non their way, travelling further than on the previous days.\r\n\r\n11. When this transaction became known, the emperor being greatly moved\r\nat the king's flight, fearing he would break off his alliance, sent\r\nDaniel and Barzimeres to bring him back; the one being a count, the\r\nother the tribune of the Scutarii, and he placed under their command a\r\nthousand archers prepared for a rapid march by the lightness of their\r\nequipment.\r\n\r\n12. These officers, trusting to their acquaintance with the country, and\r\nfeeling sure that Para, as a stranger who was not accustomed to it,\r\nwould take a roundabout way, sought to cut him off by marking a short\r\ncut through some valleys; and having divided their forces, they\r\nblockaded the two nearest roads, which were three miles from one\r\nanother, in order that whichever Para took he might be caught before he\r\nexpected it. But he escaped their manoeuvre in this way:--\r\n\r\n13. A traveller who happened to be hastening towards the western bank of\r\nthe river, saw that the two roads were filled with armed soldiers, and\r\naccordingly quitted this road in order to avoid them, and made his way\r\nby an almost invisible path, which lay between them, overgrown with\r\nbushes and brambles, and fell in with the Armenians, who were by this\r\ntime greatly fatigued. He was brought before the king, and, being\r\nadmitted by him to a private conference, related to him secretly what he\r\nhad seen, and was detained in safety.\r\n\r\n14. And presently, without anything being done to give an idea that they\r\nwere alarmed, a horseman was sent secretly to the road on the right side\r\nto prepare a resting-place and some food. And when he had been gone a\r\nlittle time, another was sent to the left with directions to move with\r\ngreat rapidity, and do the same thing; neither horseman being aware that\r\nthe other had been sent in a different direction.\r\n\r\n15. And after this arrangement had been thus cleverly made, the king\r\nhimself, with his escort, retraced his steps through the jungle by which\r\nthe traveller had come, taking him for his guide, and passing through\r\nthis overgrown path, which was almost too narrow for a loaded horse, he\r\nleft the Roman soldiers behind him and so escaped. Meanwhile our\r\ntroops, who had made prisoners of the soldiers who had been thus sent\r\nout to impose upon them, waited a long time, while watching for the\r\nking, and stretching out their hands, as one may say, to seize the game\r\nwhich they expected would rush into them. And while they were thus\r\nwaiting for the arrival of Para, he reached his kingdom in safety, where\r\nhe was received with great joy by his countrymen, and still remained\r\nunshaken in his fidelity to us, burying in silence the injuries which he\r\nhad received.\r\n\r\n16. After this, Daniel and Barzimeres, having been thus balked of their\r\nprey, returned to Tarsus, and were loaded with bitter reproaches as\r\ninactive and blundering officers. But like venomous serpents whose first\r\nspring has failed, they only whetted their deadly fangs, in order at the\r\nfirst opportunity to inflict all the injury in their power on the king\r\nwho had thus escaped them.\r\n\r\n17. And, with a view to palliate the effect of their own mistake, or\r\nrather of the defeat their hopes, which the deeper sagacity of the king\r\nhad contrived, they began to fill the emperor's ears, which were at all\r\ntimes most ready to receive all kinds of reports with false accusations\r\nagainst Para; pretending that he was skilled in Circean incantations, so\r\nas to be able to transform people, or to afflict them with sickness in a\r\nmarvellous manner, adding, moreover, that it was by means of arts of\r\nthis kind that he had rendered himself invisible, and that if allowed to\r\ncontinue changing his shape, he would cause them great trouble, if\r\npermitted to live to boast of having deceived them.\r\n\r\n18. In this manner the hatred which Valens had conceived against him was\r\nincreased to an incredible degree; and plan after plan was laid to take\r\nhis life, either by force or stratagem; and orders to that effect were\r\ntransmitted by secret letters to Trajan, who at that time was in\r\nArmenia, in chief command of the forces in that kingdom.\r\n\r\n19. Trajan, accordingly, began to surround Para with treacherous\r\nblandishments--at one time showing him some letters of Valens, which\r\nappeared to indicate that he was favourably disposed towards the\r\nking--at another, partaking cheerfully of his entertainments, he at\r\nlast, with great apparent respect (but in pursuance of a deliberate\r\nplot), invited him to supper. Para, fearing no hostility, came, and was\r\nplaced in the seat of honour at the feast.\r\n\r\n20. Exquisite delicacies were set before him, and the splendid palace\r\nresounded with the music of lyres and lutes. Presently, when the wine\r\nhad circulated freely, the master of the feast quitted it for a moment,\r\nunder pretence of some natural want, and immediately a ferocious\r\nbarbarian of the troop they call Supræ[183] was sent in, brandishing a\r\ndrawn sword, and with a terribly ferocious countenance, to murder the\r\nyouth, against whose escape ample precautions had now been taken.\r\n\r\n21. As soon as he saw him, the king, who as it happened was on the\r\nfurther side of the couch, jumped up and drew his dagger to defend his\r\nlife by every means in his power, but was stabbed in the breast, and\r\nfell like a miserable victim, being shamefully cut to pieces with\r\nrepeated blows.\r\n\r\n22. By this foul contrivance was his credulity shamefully deceived at a\r\nfeast which is respected even on the coast of the Euxine Sea, under the\r\neye of the Deity of Hospitality; and the blood of a stranger and a guest\r\nwas sprinkled on the splendid tablecloths, and, by its foaming gore,\r\nfilled the guests with loathing, who at once dispersed in great horror.\r\nIf the dead can feel sorrow or indignation, then let that illustrious\r\nFabricius Luscinus groan at the evidence of this deed, knowing with what\r\ngreatness of mind he himself repelled Demochares (or, as some call him,\r\nNicias), the king's servant, who in a secret conference offered to\r\npoison Pyrrhus, at that time desolating Italy with cruel wars, and wrote\r\nto the king, bidding him beware of his immediate attendants: such great\r\nreverence in the first ages of antiquity was there for the rights of\r\nhospitality even when claimed by an enemy.\r\n\r\n23. But this modern, strange, and shameful act was excused by the\r\nprecedent afforded by the death of Sertorius; though the emperor's\r\nflatterers were perhaps ignorant that, as Demosthenes--the everlasting\r\nglory of Greece--affirms, an unlawful and wicked action cannot be\r\ndefended by its resemblance to another crime, or by the fact that that\r\ncrime met with impunity.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. These are the transactions which especially attracted notice in\r\nArmenia; but Sapor, after the last defeat which his troops had\r\nexperienced, having heard of the death of Para, whom he had been\r\nearnestly labouring to win to his own alliance, was terribly grieved;\r\nand, as the activity of our army increased his apprehensions, he began\r\nto dread still greater disasters to himself.\r\n\r\n2. He therefore sent Arsaces as his ambassador to the emperor, to advise\r\nhim utterly to destroy Armenia as a perpetual cause of trouble; or, if\r\nthat plan should be decided against, asking that an end might be put to\r\nthe division of Hiberia into two provinces, that the Roman garrison\r\nmight be withdrawn, and that Aspacuras, whom he himself had made the\r\nsovereign of the nation, might be permitted to reign with undivided\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\n3. To this proposal, Valens replied, that he could not change the\r\nresolutions which had been agreed to by both of them; and, indeed, that\r\nhe should maintain them with zealous care. Towards the end of the\r\nwinter, letters were received from the king of a tenor very contrary to\r\nthis noble determination of Valens, full of vain and arrogant boasting.\r\nFor in them Sapor affirmed that it was impossible for the seeds of\r\ndiscord to be radically extirpated, unless those who had been witnesses\r\nof the peace which had been made with Julian were all collected, some of\r\nwhom he knew to be already dead.\r\n\r\n4. After this, the matter becoming a source of greater anxiety, the\r\nemperor, who was more skilful in choosing between different plans than\r\nin devising them himself, thinking that it would be beneficial to the\r\nstate in general, ordered Victor, the commander of the cavalry, and\r\nUrbicius, the Duke of Mesopotamia, to march with all speed to Persia,\r\nbearing a positive and plain answer to the proposals of Sapor: namely,\r\nthat he, who boasted of being a just man, and one contented with his\r\nown, was acting wickedly in coveting Armenia, after a promise had been\r\nmade to its inhabitants, that they should be allowed to live according\r\nto their own laws. And unless the soldiers who had been left as\r\nauxiliaries to Sauromaces returned without hindrance at the beginning of\r\nthe ensuing year, as had been agreed, he would compel Sapor by force to\r\nperform what he might at present do with a good grace.\r\n\r\n5. And this embassy would in all respects have been a just and\r\nhonourable one, if the ambassadors had not, contrary to their\r\ninstructions, accepted some small districts in this same Armenia which\r\nwere offered them. When the ambassadors returned, the Surena (the\r\nmagistrate who enjoys an authority second only to that of the king) came\r\nwith them, offering the said districts to the emperor which our\r\nambassadors had ventured to take.\r\n\r\n6. He was received with liberality and magnificence; but dismissed\r\nwithout obtaining what he requested. And then, great preparations were\r\nmade for war, in order that, as soon as the severity of the winter was\r\nover, the emperor might invade Persia with three armies; and with this\r\nobject he began with all speed to bargain for the services of some\r\nScythian auxiliaries.\r\n\r\n7. Sapor not having succeeded in obtaining what his vain hopes had led\r\nhim to reckon on, and being exasperated in an extraordinary degree,\r\nbecause he had learnt that our emperor was preparing for an expedition,\r\nnevertheless stifled his wrath, and gave the Surena a commission to\r\nendeavour to recover by force of arms (if any one should resist him) the\r\nterritories which Count Victor and Urbicius had accepted, and to press\r\nhostilities with the utmost rigour against those soldiers who had been\r\ndestined to aid Sauromaces.\r\n\r\n8. His orders were at once carried out. Nor was it found possible to\r\nprevent or resist their execution, because a new cause of alarm suddenly\r\ncame on the republic; as the entire nation of the Goths suddenly burst\r\ninto Thrace. The calamities which we experienced from that event shall\r\nbe related succinctly in their proper places.\r\n\r\n9. These were the occurrences which took place in the East. And while\r\nthey were proceeding, as has been related, the unfailing arm of justice\r\navenged the losses we had sustained in Africa, and the slaughter of the\r\nambassadors of Tripoli, whose shades were still wandering about\r\nunavenged. For Justice, though a late, is yet a scrupulous and unerring\r\ndiscriminator between right and wrong.\r\n\r\n10. Remigius, whom we have already spoken of as favouring Count Romanus,\r\nwho had laid waste these provinces after Leo had succeeded him as master\r\nof the offices, retired from office and from public life, and devoted\r\nhimself to rural pursuits in his own native district near Mayence.\r\n\r\n11. And while he was living there in security, Maximin, the prefect of\r\nthe prætorium, despising him because of his return to a tranquil life,\r\nas he was accustomed to attack everything like a terrible pestilence,\r\nset to work to do him injury by every means in his power. And, in order\r\nto hunt out all his secrets, he seized Cæsarius who had formerly been a\r\nservant of his, and afterwards had become a secretary of the emperor,\r\nand put him to the question, torturing him with great severity to learn\r\nfrom him what Remigius had done, and how much he had received to induce\r\nhim to countenance the wicked actions of Romanus.\r\n\r\n12. But when Remigius heard this in his retreat, to which, as has been\r\nsaid, he had retired; being oppressed by the consciousness of his acts,\r\nor perhaps letting the dread of false accusation overpower his reason,\r\nhe hanged himself.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. The next year Gratian took Equitius as his colleague in the\r\nconsulship; and Valentinian, after desolating some cantons of the\r\nAllemanni, was building a fortress near Basle, which the natives of the\r\ncountry call Robur, when a report was brought to him from the prefect\r\nProbus with an account of the disasters which had taken place in\r\nIllyricum.\r\n\r\n2. He read them with a very careful examination, as became a prudent\r\ngeneral; and then being filled with anxious thoughts, he sent his\r\nsecretary, Paternianus, to that country, to inquire minutely into the\r\nwhole details of the affair. And, as he soon received from him a true\r\naccount of all that had taken place, he prepared to repair thither\r\nhimself with all speed, in order to overwhelm with the first crash of\r\nhis arms (such was his idea) the barbarians who had dared to pollute our\r\nfrontier.\r\n\r\n3. But, because, as it was now the end of autumn, there were many\r\nserious difficulties in the way, all the nobles in the palace pressed\r\nhim earnestly to allow the time between that and the beginning of spring\r\nto be spent in embassies and conferences. Reminding him, in the first\r\nplace, that the roads were all impassable through frost--that it was\r\nimpossible to find herbage to feed the cattle, or anything else that\r\nwould be useful. In the next place, they dwelt on the ferocity of the\r\nchieftains who lay nearest to Gaul, and especially of Macrianus whom\r\nthey greatly dreaded, as it was quite certain that he was no friend to\r\nus, and was inclined to attack even the fortified cities.\r\n\r\n4. By recapitulating these arguments, and adding others of great weight,\r\nthey brought the emperor to adopt a wiser plan; and immediately (as was\r\nbest for the commonwealth) King Macrianus was invited in courteous terms\r\nto come to Mayence; and the event proved that he also was well inclined\r\nto make a treaty. When he arrived, however, it was marvellous how proud\r\nand arrogant he was, as if he were to be the supreme arbiter of the\r\npeace. And on a day appointed for a conference he came, carrying himself\r\nvery loftily, to the very brink of the Rhine, and escorted by a number\r\nof his countrymen, who made a great clang with their shields.\r\n\r\n5. On the other hand, the emperor, having embarked in a boat, such as is\r\nused on that river, and likewise escorted by a strong force, came with\r\ngreat confidence up to the eastern bank, being conspicuous through the\r\nbrilliancy of his glittering standards; and when the frantic gestures\r\nand murmurs of the barbarians had been quieted, a long discussion took\r\nplace on both sides, and at last a firm friendship was agreed on, and\r\nratified with an oath.\r\n\r\n6. When this was over, the king, who had been the cause of all these\r\ntroubles, retired, quite pacified, and destined to prove an ally to us\r\nfor the future; indeed, he afterwards, to the very end of his life, gave\r\nproof of his constancy and resolution to preserve his agreement with\r\nus, by many noble and gallant actions.\r\n\r\n7. But subsequently he died in the country of the Franks, which he had\r\ninvaded and ravaged in a most destructive manner, till at last he was\r\ncut off by the manoeuvres of Mellobaudes, the warlike king of that\r\nnation, and slain. After the treaty had thus been solemnly ratified,\r\nValentinian retired into winter quarters, at Treves.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n§ 1. These were the events which took place in Gaul and the northern\r\ncountries. But in the east, while all our foreign affairs were quiet,\r\ngreat domestic evils were increasing in consequence of the conduct of\r\nthe friends and relations of Valens, who had more regard to expediency\r\nthan honesty; for they laboured with the utmost diligence to bring about\r\nthe recall from his post a judge of rigid probity, who was fond of\r\ndeciding lawsuits equitably, out of a fear lest, as in the times of\r\nJulian, when Innocence was allowed a fair opportunity of defending\r\nitself, the pride of the powerful nobles, which was accustomed to roam\r\nat large with unrestrained licence, might again be broken down.\r\n\r\n2. With these and similar objects a great number of persons conspired\r\ntogether, being led by Modestus, the prefect of the prætorium, who was a\r\ncomplete slave to the wishes of the emperor's eunuchs, and who, under a\r\nspecious countenance, concealed a rough disposition which had never been\r\npolished by any study of ancient virtue or literature, and who was\r\ncontinually asserting that to look into the minute details of private\r\nactions was beneath the dignity of the emperor. He thinking, as he said,\r\nthat the examination of such matters had been imposed on the nobles to\r\nlower their dignity, abstained from all such matters himself, and opened\r\nthe doors to plunder; which doors are now daily more and more opened by\r\nthe depravity of the judges and advocates, who are all of the same mind,\r\nand who sell the interests of the poor to the military commanders, or\r\nthe persons of influence within the palace, by which conduct they\r\nthemselves have gained riches and high rank.\r\n\r\n3. This profession of forensic oratory the wisdom of Plato defines to be\r\n+politikês moriou eidôlon+, \"the shadow of a fraction of the art\r\nof government,\" or a fourth part of the art of flattery. But Epicurus\r\ncalls it +kakotechnia+, reckoning it among the wicked arts.\r\nTisias, who has Gorgias of Leontinum on his side, calls the orator an\r\nartist of persuasion.\r\n\r\n4. And while such has been the opinion formed of this art by the\r\nancients, the craft of some of the Eastern people has put it forward so\r\nas to make it an object of hatred to good men, on which account an\r\norator it is sometimes restricted to a limited time for speaking.[184]\r\nTherefore, after saying a few words about its unworthy character, as I\r\nfound by experience while in those countries, I will return to my\r\noriginal subject.\r\n\r\n5. The tribunals, in former times, when good taste prevailed, were\r\ngreatly adorned by our advocates, when orators of spirited\r\neloquence--laborious and accomplished scholars--shone pre-eminent in\r\ngenius, honesty, fluency, and every kind of embellishment of language.\r\nAs Demosthenes, who, as we learn from the Athenian records, whenever he\r\nwas going to speak, drew together a vast concourse of people from the\r\nwhole of Greece, who assembled for the sake of hearing him; and\r\nCallistratus, who, when summing up his noble pleading on the subject of\r\nOropus in Euboea, produced such an impression that that same\r\nDemosthenes quitted the academy, at the time when Plato was at its head,\r\nto become his follower. And Hyperides, and Æschines, and Andocides, and\r\nDinarchus, and Antiphon the Rhamnusian, who is the first man spoken of\r\nin ancient history as having received a fee for pleading a cause.\r\n\r\n6. And similarly among the Romans, the Rutilii, and Galbæ, and Scauri,\r\nmen of eminent reputation for purity of life and manners, and for\r\nfrugality; and in the succeeding generations, many men of censorian and\r\nconsular rank, and even many who had celebrated triumphs, such as the\r\nCrassi, the Antonii, the Philipii, the Scævolæ, and numbers of others,\r\nafter having commanded armies with glory, gained victories, and raised\r\ntrophies, became eminent also for their civil services to the State, and\r\nwon fresh laurels by their noble contests at the bar, thus reaping the\r\nhighest honour and glory.\r\n\r\n7. And after them Cicero, the most excellent of them all, who repeatedly\r\nsaved many who were in distress from the scorching flames of judgment by\r\nthe stream of his imperious eloquence, used to affirm \"that if men could\r\nnot be defended without their advocate incurring blame, they certainly\r\ncould not be carelessly defended without his being guilty of crime.\"\r\n\r\n8. But now throughout all the regions of the East one may see the most\r\nviolent and rapacious classes of men hovering about the courts of law,\r\nand besieging the houses of the rich like Spartan or Cretan hounds,\r\ncunningly pursuing different traces, in order to create the occasion of\r\na lawsuit.\r\n\r\n9. Of these the chief is that tribe of men who, sowing every variety of\r\nstrife and contest in thousands of actions, wear out the doorposts of\r\nwidows and the thresholds of orphans, and create bitter hatred among\r\nfriends, relations, or connections, who have any disagreement, if they\r\ncan only find the least pretext for a quarrel. And in these men, the\r\nprogress of age does not cool their vices as it does those of others,\r\nbut only hardens and strengthens them. And amid all their plunder they\r\nare insatiable and yet poor, whetting the edge of their genius in order\r\nby their crafty orations to catch the ear of the judges, though the very\r\ntitle of those magistrates is derived from the name of Justice.\r\n\r\n10. In the pertinacity of these men rashness assumes the disguise of\r\nfreedom--headlong audacity seeks to be taken for constancy, and an empty\r\nfluency of language usurps the name of eloquence--by which perverse\r\narts, as Cicero tells us, it is a shame for the holy gravity of a judge\r\nbe deceived. For he says, \"And as nothing in a republic ought to be so\r\nincorruptible as a suffrage or a sentence, I do not understand why the\r\nman who corrupts such things with money is to be esteemed worthy of\r\npunishment, while he who perverts them by eloquence receives\r\ncommendation. In fact, the latter appears to me to do the most harm, it\r\nbeing worse to corrupt a judge by a speech than by a bribe, inasmuch as\r\nno one can corrupt a wise man with a bribe, though it is possible that\r\nhe may with eloquence.\"\r\n\r\n11. There is a second class of those men who, professing the science of\r\nthe law, especially the interpretation of conflicting and obsolete\r\nstatutes, as if they had a bridle placed in their mouths, keep a\r\nresolute silence, in which they rather resemble their shadows than\r\nthemselves. These, like those men who cast nativities or interpret the\r\noracles of the sibyl, compose their countenances to a sort of gravity,\r\nand then make money of their supine drowsiness.\r\n\r\n12. And that they may appear to have a more profound knowledge of the\r\nlaws, they speak of Trebatius,[185] and Cascellius, and Alfenus, and of\r\nthe laws of the Aurunci and Sicani, which have long become obsolete, and\r\nhave been buried ages ago with the mother of Evander. And if you should\r\npretend to have deliberately murdered your mother, they will promise you\r\nthat there are many cases recorded in abstruse works which will secure\r\nyour acquittal, if you are rich enough to pay for it.\r\n\r\n13. There is a third class of these men, who, to arrive at distinction\r\nin a turbulent profession, sharpen their mercenary mouths to mystify the\r\ntruth, and by prostituting their countenances and their vile barking,\r\nwork their way with the public. These men, whenever the judge is\r\nembarrassed and perplexed, entangle the matter before him with further\r\ndifficulties, and take pains to prevent any arrangement, carefully\r\ninvolving every suit in knotty subtleties. When these courts, however,\r\ngo on rightly, they are temples of equity; but when they are perverted\r\nthey are hidden and treacherous pitfalls, and if any person falls into\r\nthem, he will not escape till after many years have elapsed, and till he\r\nhimself has been sucked dry to his very marrow.\r\n\r\n14. There is a fourth and last class, impudent, saucy, and ignorant,\r\nconsisting of those men who, having left school too early, run about\r\nthe corners of cities, giving more time to farces than to the study of\r\nactions and defences, wearing out the doors of the rich, and hunting for\r\nthe luxuries of banquets and rich food.\r\n\r\n15. And when they have given themselves up to gains, and to the task of\r\nhunting for money by every means, they incite men, on any small pretence\r\nwhatever, to go to law; and if they are permitted to defend a cause,\r\nwhich but seldom happens, it is not till they are before the judge,\r\nwhile the pleadings are being recited, that they begin to inquire into\r\nthe cause of the client, or even into his name; and then they so\r\noverflow with a heap of unarranged phrases and circumlocutions, that\r\nfrom the noise and jabber of the vile medley you would fancy you were\r\nlistening to Thersites.\r\n\r\n16. But when it happens that they have no single allegation they can\r\nestablish, they then resort to an unbridled licence of abuse; for which\r\nconduct they are continually brought to trial themselves, and convicted,\r\nwhen they have poured ceaseless abuse upon people of honour; and some of\r\nthese men are so ignorant that they do not appear ever to have read any\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\n17. And if in a company of learned men the name of any ancient author is\r\never mentioned, they fancy it to be some foreign name of a fish or other\r\neatable. And if any stranger asks (we will say) for Marcianus, as one\r\nwith whom he is as yet unacquainted, they all at once pretend that their\r\nname is Marcianus.\r\n\r\n18. Nor do they pay the slightest attention to what is right; but as if\r\nthey had been sold to and become the property of Avarice, they know\r\nnothing but a boundless licence in asking. And if they catch any one in\r\ntheir toils, they entangle him in a thousand meshes, pretending sickness\r\nby way of protracting the consultations. And to produce an useless\r\nrecital of some well-known law, they prepare seven costly methods of\r\nintroducing it, thus weaving infinite complications and delays.\r\n\r\n19. And when at last days and months and years have been passed in these\r\nproceedings, and the parties to the suit are exhausted, and the whole\r\nmatter in dispute is worn out with age, then these men, as if they were\r\nthe very heads of their profession, often introduce sham advocates\r\nalong with themselves. And when they have arrived within the bar, and\r\nthe fortune or safety of some one is at stake, and they ought to labour\r\nto ward off the sword of the executioner from some innocent man, or\r\ncalamity and ruin, then, with wrinkled brows, and arms thrown about with\r\nactor-like gestures, so that they want nothing but the flute of Gracchus\r\nat their back,[186] then they keep silence for some time on both sides;\r\nand at last, after a scene of premeditated collusion, some plausible\r\npreamble is pronounced by that one of them who is most confident in his\r\npower of speaking, and who promises an oration which shall rival the\r\nbeauties of the oration for Cluentius[187] or for Ctesiphon.[188] And\r\nthen, when all are eager for him to make an end, he concludes his\r\npreamble with a statement that the chief advocates have as yet only had\r\nthree years since the commencement of the suit to prepare themselves to\r\nconduct it; and so obtains an adjournment, as if they had to wrestle\r\nwith the ancient Antæus, while still they resolutely demand the pay due\r\nfor their arduous labours.\r\n\r\n20. And yet, in spite of all these things, advocates are not without\r\nsome inconveniences, which are hard to be endured by one who would live\r\nuprightly. For being allured by small gains, they quarrel bitterly among\r\nthemselves, and offend numbers by the insane ferocity of their evil\r\nspeaking, which they pour forth when they are unable to maintain the\r\nweakness of the case intrusted to them by any sound reasoning.\r\n\r\n21. And sometimes the judges prefer persons who have been instructed in\r\nthe quibbles of Philistion or Æsop, to those who come from the school of\r\nAristides the Just, or of Cato--men who, having bought public offices\r\nfor large sums of money, proceed like troublesome creditors to hunt out\r\nevery one's fortune, and so shake booty for themselves out of the laps\r\nof others.\r\n\r\n22. Finally, the profession of a lawyer, besides other things, has in it\r\nthis, which is most especially formidable and serious (and this quality\r\nis almost innate in all litigants), namely that when, through one or\r\nother out of a thousand accidents, they have lost their action, they\r\nfancy that everything which turned out wrong was owing to the conduct of\r\ntheir counsel, and they usually attribute the loss of every suit to him,\r\nand are angry, not with the weakness of their case or (as they often\r\nmight be) with the partiality of the judge, but only with their\r\nadvocate. Let us now return to the affairs from which we have thus\r\ndigressed.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nA.D. 375.\r\n\r\n§ 1. At the beginning of the spring Valentinian quitted Treves, and\r\nproceeded by rapid marches along the usual high roads. And as he\r\napproached the districts to which he was hastening, he was met by\r\nambassadors from the Sarmatians, who threw themselves at his feet, and,\r\nwith prayers, breathing no wish but for peace, entreated him to be\r\nfavourable and merciful to them, assuring him that he would not find any\r\nof their countrymen implicated in or privy to any evil action.\r\n\r\n2. And when they had frequently repeated this assertion, he, after\r\ncareful deliberation, made answer to them, that these matters must be\r\ndiligently inquired into by an accurate investigation in the district\r\nwhere they were said to have happened, and if they had happened, then\r\nthey must be punished. After this, when he had reached Carnuntum, a city\r\nof the Illyrians, now indeed in a desolate and ruinous state, but still\r\nvery convenient for the general of an army, he from thence sallied out\r\nwhenever either chance or skill afforded him an opportunity; and by the\r\npossession of this post in their neighbourhood, he checked the inroads\r\nof the barbarians.\r\n\r\n3. And although he alarmed all people in that district, since it was\r\nexpected that, as a man of active and impetuous feelings, he would\r\nspeedily command the judges to be condemned through whose perfidy or\r\ndesertion the empire had been left undefended on the side of the\r\nPannonians, yet when he did arrive he was so lukewarm in the business\r\nthat he neither inquired into the death of the king Gabricius, nor did\r\nhe make any accurate investigation into the calamities which the\r\nrepublic had sustained, with a view to learning through whose misconduct\r\nor negligence these events had taken place; so that in fact, in\r\nproportion as he was severe in punishing his common soldiers, he was\r\nremiss in correcting (even by harsh words) those of higher rank.\r\n\r\n4. The only person whom he pursued with any especial hatred was Probus;\r\nwhom from the first moment that he saw him he never ceased to threaten,\r\nand to whom he never softened; and the causes of this animosity against\r\nhim were not obscure nor trivial. When Probus first obtained the rank of\r\nprefect of the prætorium, the power of which he was continually\r\nlabouring to extend by all kinds of means (I wish I could say by all\r\nlawful means), he forgot the lessons which he might have learnt from his\r\nillustrious descent, and devoted himself more to flattery than to\r\nmodesty.\r\n\r\n5. For reflecting on the resolution of the emperor, who considered\r\nnothing but how he might amass money from all quarters, without any\r\ndistinction between just and unjust actions; he never attempted to lead\r\nback the misguided prince into the path of equity, as mild and wise\r\nrulers often have done; but rather followed his lead through all his\r\nwinding and tortuous paths.\r\n\r\n6. And to this conduct were owing the heavy distresses which afflicted\r\nthe emperor's subjects; the ruinous titles, privileges, and exemptions,\r\nwhich alike ate up the fortunes of poor and rich; under different\r\npretexts which were produced, each more powerful than the other, as the\r\nfruit of a long experience in injuring. Lastly, the burdens of all\r\ntributes and taxes were augmented in a manifold degree; and drove some\r\nof the highest nobles from fear of the worst to emigrate from their\r\nhomes; some also after being drained to the utmost by the cruelty of the\r\nrevenue officers, as they really had nothing more to give, were thrown\r\ninto prison, of which they became permanent inmates. And some, becoming\r\nweary of life and light, sought a release from their miseries by hanging\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n7. Unvarying report made known the treacherous and inhuman character of\r\nthese transactions; but Valentinian, as if his ears had been stopped\r\nwith wax, was ignorant of the report, being eager to acquire money\r\nindiscriminately, even from the most trivial sources, and thinking only\r\nof what was presented to him; though he would perhaps have spared the\r\nPannonian provinces, if he had earlier known of these melancholy sources\r\nof gain with which he became acquainted when it was too late, owing to\r\nthe following occurrence:--\r\n\r\n8. Following the example of the inhabitants of other provinces, the\r\npeople of Epirus were compelled by the prefect to send envoys to thank\r\nhim, and a certain philosopher named Iphicles, a man of tried courage\r\nand magnanimity (who was very unwilling to undertake the commission),\r\nwas elected to discharge that duty.\r\n\r\n9. And when he saw the emperor, having been recognized by him and\r\nquestioned as to the cause of his arrival, he answered in Greek; and,\r\nlike a philosopher who professed himself a votary of truth, when the\r\nprince inquired more precisely, if those who had sent him did really\r\nthink well of the prefect, he replied, that they had sent him against\r\ntheir will, and with bitter groans.\r\n\r\n10. The emperor, stricken by this speech as by an arrow, now\r\ninvestigated his actions like a sagacious beast, inquiring of him, in\r\nhis own language, about different persons whom he knew: for instance,\r\nwhere was this man or that man (mentioning some one of high reputation\r\nand honour, or some very rich man, or some other person well known as\r\nhaving filled some high office). And when he learnt that this man had\r\nbeen hanged, that that one had been banished beyond the seas, and that a\r\nthird had killed himself or had expired under torture, he became\r\nfuriously angry, while Leo, who was at that time master of the offices,\r\nadded fuel to his passion--O shameful villany! Leo, it should be borne\r\nin mind, was at this very time secretly aiming at the prefecture; and\r\nhad he obtained that office and authority, he would undoubtedly have\r\ngoverned with such audacity, that the administration of Probus would in\r\ncomparison have been extolled as a model of justice and humanity.\r\n\r\n11. So the emperor remained at Carnuntum; and during the three summer\r\nmonths he occupied himself uninterruptedly in preparing arms and\r\nmagazines, in the hope that chance might afford him a good opportunity\r\nof making use of them; intending to take a favourable season for\r\nattacking the Quadi, who had lately caused an atrocious disturbance;\r\nsince in their chief town, Faustinus, the nephew of Juventius, the\r\nprefect of the prætorium, who had attained the rank of military\r\nsecretary, was tortured and then put to death by the executioners, under\r\nthe very eyes of Probus; having been accused of slaying an ass in some\r\nmagical operation, as his enemies asserted; but he himself said it was\r\nto use for strengthening his hair, which was beginning to fall off.\r\n\r\n12. Another charge was also maliciously brought against him, namely,\r\nthat when a person of the name of Nigrinus had in jest asked him to make\r\nhim a secretary, he replied in ridicule of the man and his petition,\r\n\"Make me emperor if you wish to obtain that.\" And because some gave an\r\nunfair interpretation to this jest, Faustinus himself, and Nigrinus, and\r\nseveral other persons were put to death.\r\n\r\n13. Accordingly, having sent forward Merobaudes with a strong force of\r\ninfantry under his command, and Sebastian for his colleague, to ravage\r\nthe districts of the barbarians with fire and sword, Valentinian\r\nspeedily moved his camp to Buda; and having with great rapidity made a\r\nbridge of boats in order to guard against any sudden mishap, he crossed\r\nthe river in another place and entered the territories of the Quadi, who\r\nfrom their precipitous mountains were watching for his approach; the\r\nmain body of their nation, in their perplexity and uncertainty of what\r\nmight happen, had taken refuge with their families in those hills; but\r\nwere overwhelmed with consternation when they unexpectedly saw the\r\nimperial standards in their country.\r\n\r\n14. Valentinian advanced with as much rapidity as he could, slaughtering\r\nevery one of whatever age whom his sudden inroad surprised straggling\r\nabout the country, and after burning all their dwellings, he returned\r\nsafe without having experienced the slightest loss. And then, as autumn\r\nwas now on the wane, he stopped awhile at Buda, seeking where best to\r\nfix his winter quarters in a region subject to very rigorous frost. And\r\nhe could not find any suitable place except Sabaria, though that town\r\nwas at the time in a very bad state of defence, having been ruined by\r\nfrequent sieges.\r\n\r\n15. Accordingly when he reached this place, though it was one of great\r\nconsequence to him, he remained there but a very short time; and having\r\nleft it, he marched along the bank of the river, which he strengthened\r\nwith several forts and castles, and manned them with adequate garrisons.\r\nHe then proceeded to Bregitio; and in that town, after settling down\r\nthere in quiet, his Destiny, by numerous prodigies, portended to him his\r\napproaching fate.\r\n\r\n16. For a very few days before some of those comets, which ever give\r\ntoken of the ruins of lofty fortunes, and of which we have already\r\nexplained the origin, appeared in the heavens. Also, a short time\r\nbefore, a thunderbolt fell at Sirmium, accompanied with a terrific clap\r\nof thunder, and set fire to a portion of the palace and senate-house:\r\nand much about the same time an owl settled on the top of the royal\r\nbaths at Sabaria, and pouring forth a funeral strain, withstood all the\r\nattempts to slay it with arrows or stones, however truly aimed, and\r\nthough numbers of people shot at it in diligent rivalry.\r\n\r\n17. And again, when the emperor was quitting the city to return to the\r\ncamp, he set out to leave it by the same gate by which he had entered\r\nit, with the object of obtaining an augury that he should speedily\r\nreturn to Gaul. But the spot through neglect had become choked up with\r\nruins; and when they were cleaning it out they found that the door,\r\nwhich had originally closed the entrance, had fallen down: and a great\r\nmultitude of people, though labouring with all their might, were unable\r\nto remove it; so that after waiting the greater part of the day there,\r\nhe was obliged at last to go out by another gate.\r\n\r\n18. And on the night preceding the day on which he died, he saw in a\r\ndream, such as often visits a man in his sleep, his absent wife sitting\r\nby, with dishevelled hair, and clad in a mourning robe; which some\r\npeople fancied was Fortune, who was about in this sad apparel to take\r\nher leave of him.\r\n\r\n19. After this, when he came forth in the morning, his brow was\r\ncontracted, and his countenance somewhat melancholy; and when his horse\r\nwas brought to him, it would not let him mount, but reared up its\r\nforefeet over the shoulders of the equerry who was holding it.\r\nValentinian, according to the usual bent of his savage temper, grew\r\nimmoderately furious, and ordered the equerry's hand to be cut off,\r\nwhich had, he said, pushed him aside when mounting a horse he was used\r\nto: and the innocent youth would have perished under torture if\r\nCerealis, the principal master of the horse, had not delayed the\r\nbarbarous infliction at his own risk.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n§ 1. After this event ambassadors arrived from the Quadi, with humble\r\nsupplications, entreating peace, and oblivion of the past: and that\r\nthere might be no obstacle to their obtaining this, they promised to\r\nfurnish a body of recruits, and some other things which would be of use\r\nto the Roman state.\r\n\r\n2. And after they had been received, and had obtained permission to\r\nreturn with the grant of an armistice which they had solicited (but in\r\ntruth, our want of supplies and the unfavourable season of the year\r\nprevented us from harassing them any longer), they were, by the\r\ninfluence of Equitius, who became security for their good behaviour,\r\nadmitted into the council-chamber. When introduced they seemed quite\r\novercome by fear, bowing down to the ground; and on being ordered to\r\nunfold their message, they urged all the customary pretences and\r\nexcuses, confirming them by an oath; assuring the council that whatever\r\noffence had been committed against any of our people, had not been done\r\nby the consent of the nobles of the nation, but only by some foreign\r\nbanditti who dwelt on the borders of the river; they added further, as a\r\nfact quite sufficient to establish the truth of their allegations, that\r\nthe fortress which had been begun to be built both unjustly and\r\nunreasonably, had inflamed the savage temper of those rude men to a\r\ngreat pitch of ferocity.\r\n\r\n3. By this speech the emperor was excited to most vehement wrath; and as\r\nhe began to reply to it he grew more indignant, reproaching the whole\r\nnation in bitter language, as unmindful of kindness, and ungrateful. But\r\nafter a time he became pacified, and inclined to a milder view of the\r\ncase, when suddenly, as if he had been stricken from heaven, his\r\nbreathing and his voice ceased, and his countenance appeared bloodshot,\r\nand in a moment the blood burst forth, and a deadly sweat broke forth\r\nover his whole body; and to save him from falling down in the sight of a\r\nnumber of low-born persons, he was led by his servants into one of the\r\nprivate chambers in the interior of the palace.\r\n\r\n4. When he was placed on his bed, breathing with difficulty, though the\r\nvigour of his intellect was not as yet at all diminished, he recognized\r\nthose who stood around, having been collected by the chamberlains with\r\ngreat promptitude, to prevent any of them being suspected of having\r\nmurdered him. And as on account of the fever which was racking his\r\nbowels it was necessary to open a vein, yet no surgeon could be found,\r\nbecause he had dispersed them all over different districts to cure the\r\nsoldiers among whom a dangerous pestilence was raging.\r\n\r\n5. At last, however, one was procured; but though he punctured a vein\r\nover and over again, he could not produce a single drop of blood, while\r\nall the time his bowels were burning with the intensity of his fever; or\r\n(as some fancied) because his limbs were wholly dried up in consequence\r\nof some of the passages, which we now call hæmorrhoidal, were closed up\r\nand crusted over through the severity of the cold.\r\n\r\n6. The emperor, from the exceeding violence of his agony, felt that the\r\nmoment of his death was at hand; and attempted to say something, and to\r\ngive some orders, as was indicated by a sobbing, which shook his whole\r\nframe, a gnashing of the teeth, and a series of violent gestures with\r\nhis arms, resembling those of boxers with the cæstus: at last he became\r\nexhausted, and covered all over with livid spots, and after a severe\r\nstruggle he expired, in the fifty-fifth year of his age, having reigned\r\ntwelve years all but a hundred days.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. This is a seasonable opportunity to do as we have often done\r\nbefore, namely, to retrace from the original appearance of the father\r\nof this emperor down to the time of his own death, all his actions, just\r\ntouching on them cursorily with a brief mention, not omitting to\r\ndistinguish between his vices and his virtues, both of which his lofty\r\nposition held up to the world; being a condition which naturally reveals\r\nthe inward disposition of every man.\r\n\r\n2. The elder Gratian was born at Cibalæ, a town of Pannonia, of a mean\r\nfamily; and from his childhood he received the surname of Funarius,\r\nbecause, while still very young, while he was carrying about a rope\r\n(funem) for sale, he resisted the attempt of five soldiers who laboured\r\nwith all their might to take it from him: thus rivalling Milo of\r\nCrotona, from whom no amount of strength could ever wrest an apple,\r\nwhether he held it in his right or his left hand.\r\n\r\n3. Therefore, on account of his exceeding personal strength, and his\r\nskill in wrestling after the military fashion, he became well known to\r\nmany persons, was promoted to the rank of an officer of the guard, then\r\nto the post of tribune: after this he was made count, and sent to\r\ncommand the forces in Africa: but there he was suspected of theft; and\r\nhaving quitted that province, he was some time afterwards sent to\r\ncommand the army in Britain, with the same authority which he had\r\nenjoyed in Africa. At length he received an honourable discharge from\r\nmilitary service, and returned home; and while living there in quiet, he\r\nsuddenly had all his property confiscated by Constantius, on the ground\r\nthat, when the civil discord was at its height, he was said to have\r\nreceived Magnentius as a guest when passing through his land to carry\r\nhis designs into execution.\r\n\r\n4. The merits of Gratian brought Valentinian into notice from his early\r\nyouth; and, indeed, he was further aided by his own eminent qualities;\r\nso that he received the ornaments of the imperial majesty at Nicæa; when\r\nhe also made his brother Valens his colleague, as one bound to him not\r\nonly by his relationship as a brother, but also by the most perfect\r\nagreement--Valens, as we shall show at a suitable time, being made up\r\nalmost equally of vices and of virtues.\r\n\r\n5. Therefore Valentinian, after having experienced many dangers and much\r\ndistress as a private individual, as soon as he began to reign went to\r\nvisit the towns and cities which were situated on the rivers; and\r\nrepaired to Gaul, which was exposed to the inroads of the Allemanni, who\r\nhad begun to recover their courage and to reassume an imposing attitude\r\nsince they had heard of the death of the Emperor Julian--the only prince\r\nwhom they had feared since the time of Constans.\r\n\r\n6. And Valentinian was deservedly dreaded by them because he took care\r\nto keep up the numbers of his army by strong reinforcements, and because\r\nalso he fortified both banks of the Rhine with lofty fortresses and\r\ncastles, to prevent the enemy from ever passing over into our territory\r\nwithout being perceived.\r\n\r\n7. We may pass over many circumstances, and many acts which he performed\r\nwith the authority of an emperor whose power was fully established, and\r\nmany of the reforms which he either effected himself, or caused to be\r\ncarried out by his vigorous lieutenants. But we must record how, after\r\nhe had raised his son Gratian to a partnership in the imperial\r\nauthority, he contrived the secret murder of Vithigabius, the king of\r\nthe Allemanni, and the son of Vadomarius, a young man in the flower of\r\nyouth, who was actively stirring up the surrounding nations to tumults\r\nand wars; doing this because he found it impossible to procure his death\r\nopenly. How also he fought a battle against the Allemanni near\r\nSolicinium, where he was nearly circumvented and slain by the\r\nmanoeuvres of the enemy; but where at last he utterly destroyed their\r\nwhole army with the exception of a few who saved themselves by the aid\r\nof the darkness which assisted the rapidity of their flight.\r\n\r\n8. Amid all these prudent actions he also turned his attention to the\r\nSaxons who had lately broken out with extreme ferocity, making attacks\r\nin every direction where they were least expected, and had now\r\npenetrated into the inland districts, from which they were returning\r\nenriched by a vast booty. He destroyed them utterly by a device which\r\nwas indeed treacherous, but most advantageous; and he recovered by force\r\nall the booty which the defeated robbers were carrying off.\r\n\r\n9. Nor did he disregard the condition of the Britons, who were unable to\r\nmake head against the vast hosts of their enemies, who were overrunning\r\ntheir country; he revived their hopes of better fortune, and\r\nre-established liberty and steady tranquillity among them; routing their\r\ninvaders so completely that scarcely any of them returned to their own\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n10. With similar vigour he crushed Valentinus the Pannonian exile (who\r\nwas labouring to disturb the general tranquillity in that province),\r\nbefore his enterprise could become dangerous. He also delivered Africa\r\nfrom great dangers at a time when it was thrown into confusion by an\r\nunexpected disaster: when Firmus, unable to bear the greediness and\r\narrogance of the soldiers, was exciting the people of Mauritania to\r\nevery kind of discord and disturbance. With similar resolution would he\r\nhave avenged the disasters sustained in Illyricum, had he not left that\r\nimportant duty uncompleted, in consequence of being thus cut off by a\r\npremature death.\r\n\r\n11. And although these various achievements, which we have here\r\nrecorded, were consummated by the assistance of his admirable generals,\r\nyet it is very notorious that he himself also performed many\r\nconsiderable exploits; being a man fertile in resources, and of long\r\nexperience and great skill in military affairs: and certainly it would\r\nhave been an admirable crown to his great actions if he had been able to\r\ntake King Macrianus alive, who at that time was a very formidable\r\nsovereign; nevertheless he exerted great energy in attempting to do so,\r\nafter he heard that he had escaped from the Burgundians, whom he himself\r\nhad led against the Allemanni; and the certainty of his escape was to\r\nhim a cause of great sorrow and indignation.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. Thus have I rapidly run over the different actions of this prince.\r\nNow, relying on the certainty that posterity, inasmuch as it is free\r\nboth from fear and from base flattery, is usually an honest judge of all\r\npast transactions, I will rapidly run over his vices, intending\r\nafterwards to relate his good qualities.\r\n\r\n2. Sometimes he put on an affectation of clemency, though the bent of\r\nhis natural disposition inclined him more to cruelty: forgetful\r\nforsooth, that by a man who governs a vast empire extremes of every\r\nkind are to be avoided as rocks by a mariner.\r\n\r\n3. Nor indeed was he ever found to be contented with moderate\r\npunishments, but was continually commanding cruel tortures to be\r\nmultiplied; so that many, after undergoing this murderous kind of\r\nexamination, were brought to death's door. And he was so eager to\r\ninflict injury, that he never once saved any one who had been condemned\r\nto death, by a milder sentence, though even the most inhuman of emperors\r\nhave sometimes done so.\r\n\r\n4. And yet he might have reflected on many examples in former ages; and\r\nhe might have imitated the many models of humanity and of piety which he\r\ncould have found both among natives of the empire and among those of\r\nforeign extraction (and humanity and piety are defined by philosophers\r\nto be qualities nearly akin). Of such instances it will suffice to\r\nenumerate these which follow:--Artaxerxes, that very powerful king of\r\nPersia, to whom the great length of one of his limbs caused the name of\r\nLonghand to be given, wishing, through the natural lenity of his\r\ndisposition, to reprove the varieties of punishment in which his nation,\r\nalways cruel, had hitherto delighted, punished some criminals by taking\r\noff their turbans instead of their heads: and instead of the old royal\r\nfashion of cutting off people's ears for their offences, he used to cut\r\nthe tassels which hang from their caps. And this moderation and lenity\r\nmade him so popular and respected that all the Grecian writers vie with\r\neach other in celebrating his many admirable actions.\r\n\r\n5. Again, when Prænestinus was prætor, and was brought before the court\r\nof justice, because, in the Samnite war, when ordered to march with all\r\nspeed to reinforce the army, he had been very dilatory in his movements,\r\nPapirius Cursor, who at that time was dictator, ordered the lictor to\r\nget ready his axe; and when the prætor, having discarded all hope of\r\nbeing able to clear himself, seemed utterly stupefied at the order, he\r\ncommanded the lictor to cut down a shrub close by; and having in this\r\njocular manner reproved him, he let him go: without himself incurring\r\nany disrespect by so doing, since all knew him for a man who, by his own\r\nunassisted vigour, had brought long and dangerous wars to a happy\r\ntermination; and had been the only man reckoned able to resist\r\nAlexander the Great if that prince had invaded Italy.\r\n\r\n6. Valentinian, perhaps, was ignorant of these models; and as he never\r\nconsidered that the mercy of the emperor is always the best comfort of\r\npersons in distress, he increased all punishments by his free use of\r\nboth fire and sword: punishments which the merciful disposition of our\r\nancestors looked upon as the very last resource in the most imminent\r\ndangers--as we may learn from the beautiful sentiment of Isocrates, who\r\ncontinually insists that we ought rather to pardon a king who is\r\nsometimes defeated in war, than one who is ignorant of justice.\r\n\r\n7. And it was under the influence of this saying of his that I imagine\r\nCicero uttered that admirable sentence, in his defence of Oppius: \"That\r\nindeed to have greatly contributed to the safety of one other person was\r\nan honour to many; but that to have had no share in injuring others had\r\nnever been thought discreditable to any one.\"\r\n\r\n8. A desire of increasing his riches without any regard to right and\r\nwrong, and of hunting out every kind of source of gain, even at the cost\r\nof other people's lives, raged in this emperor to a most excessive\r\ndegree, and never flagged. Some, indeed, attempted to excuse it by\r\npleading the example of the Emperor Aurelian; affirming that as he,\r\nafter the death of Gallienus and the lamentable disasters which the\r\nrepublic suffered at that time, finding his treasury totally exhausted,\r\nfell upon the rich like a torrent, so Valentinian also, after the losses\r\nwhich he sustained in his Parthian campaign, being reduced to want by\r\nthe greatness of his expenses, in order to procure reinforcements for\r\nhis army and pay for his troops, mingled with his severity a desire of\r\ncollecting excessive wealth. Pretending not to know that there are some\r\nthings which, although strictly speaking lawful, still ought not to be\r\ndone. In this he was very unlike the celebrated Themistocles of old\r\ntimes, who, when strolling carelessly about after he had destroyed the\r\nPersian host in the battle of Salamis, and seeing a number of golden\r\narmlets and chains lying on the ground, said to one of his companions\r\nwho was by--\"You may take up these things because you are not\r\nThemistocles,\" thinking it became a magnanimous general to spurn any\r\nidea of personal gain.\r\n\r\n9. Many examples of similar moderation abound in the Roman generals;\r\nand without stopping to enumerate them, since such acts are not\r\nindications of perfect virtue (for indeed it is no great glory to\r\nabstain from carrying off other persons' property), I will just mention\r\none single instance of the forbearance of people in general in this\r\nrespect in ancient times:--When Marius and Cinna had given the Roman\r\npopulace leave to plunder the wealthy houses of certain persons whom\r\nthey had proscribed, the minds of the mob, who, however uncivilized they\r\nmight be, were accustomed to respect the rights of men, refused to touch\r\nthe produce of other men's labours; so that in fact no one could be\r\nfound so needy or so base as to be willing to profit by the miseries of\r\nthe state.\r\n\r\n10. Besides these things the aforesaid emperor was a prey in his inmost\r\nheart to a devouring envy; and as he knew that most vices put on a\r\nsemblance of virtue, he used to be fond of repeating, that severity is\r\nthe inseparable companion of lawful power. And as magistrates of the\r\nhighest rank are in the habit of thinking everything permitted to them,\r\nand are always inclined to depress those who oppose them, and to\r\nhumiliate those who are above them, so he hated all who were well\r\ndressed, or learned, or opulent, or high born; and he was always\r\ndisparaging the brave, that he might appear to be the only person\r\neminent for virtue. And this is a vice which, as we read, was very\r\nflagrant in the Emperor Hadrian.\r\n\r\n11. This same emperor used to be continually abusing the timid, calling\r\nthem sordid and base, and people who deserved to be depressed below the\r\nvery lowest of the low; and yet he himself often grew pale, in the most\r\nabject manner, with groundless fears, and often from the bottom of his\r\nsoul was terrified at things which had no existence at all.\r\n\r\n12. Remigius, the master of the ceremonies, knowing this, and also that\r\nValentinian was used to get into furious passions at every trifling\r\nincident, spread a report, among other things, that some of the\r\nbarbarians were in motion; and the emperor, when he heard this, became\r\nat once so broken-spirited through fear that he became as gentle and\r\nmerciful as Antoninus Pius.\r\n\r\n13. He never intentionally appointed unjust judges but if he learned\r\nthat those whom he had once promoted were acting cruelly, he boasted\r\nthat he had discovered new Lycurguses and Cassiuses, those ancient\r\npillars of justice; and he used to be continually exhorting them by his\r\nletters severely to chastise even the slightest errors.\r\n\r\n14. Nor had those who were under accusations, if any misfortune fell\r\nupon them, any refuge in the kindness of the prince; which ought to be,\r\nas it were, a desirable haven to those tossed about in a stormy sea.\r\nFor, as wise men teach us, \"The advantage and safety of the subject is\r\nthe true end of just government.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\n§ 1. It is natural for us, after discussing these topics, if we would\r\nact fairly, now to come to his virtuous and laudable actions; since if\r\nhe had tempered his vices fairly with them he would have been a second\r\nTrajan or Marcus Aurelius. Towards the people of the provinces he was\r\nvery considerate, lightening the burden of their tributes throughout the\r\nempire. He also exerted himself in a very beneficial manner in building\r\ntowns and strengthening the frontiers. He was a strict observer of\r\nmilitary discipline, erring only in this respect, that while he punished\r\neven slight misconduct on the part of the common soldiers, he allowed\r\nthe crimes of the officers of rank and of the generals to proceed to\r\ngreater and greater lengths, and shut his ears against every complaint\r\nthat was uttered against them. And this partiality of his was the cause\r\nof the murmurs in Britain, and the disasters in Africa, and the\r\ndevastation of Illyricum.\r\n\r\n2. He was, both at home and abroad, a strict observer of modesty and\r\nchastity, keeping his conscience wholly free from all taint of impurity\r\nor obscenity, and in consequence he bridled the wantonness of the\r\nimperial court as with a strong rein; and he was the more easily able to\r\ndo this because he had never shown any indulgence to his own relations,\r\nwhom he either kept in obscurity, or (if he promoted them at all) raised\r\nto a very moderate rank, with the exception of his brother, whom, in\r\ndeference to the necessities of the times, he made his partner in the\r\nimperial dignity.\r\n\r\n3. He was very scrupulous in giving high rank to any one; nor, as long\r\nas he was emperor, did any one of the moneyed interest become ruler of\r\na province, nor was any government sold, unless it was at the beginning\r\nof his reign, when wicked actions were sometimes committed in the hope\r\nthat the new prince would be too much occupied to punish them.\r\n\r\n4. In waging war, and in defending himself from attacks, he was prudent\r\nand very skilful, like a veteran of great experience in military\r\naffairs. He was a very wise admirer of all that was good, and dissuader\r\nfrom all that was bad; and a very accurate observer of all the details\r\nof military service. He wrote with elegance, and described everything\r\nwith great neatness and skill in composition. He was an inventor of new\r\narms. He had an excellent memory, and a fluent, easy style of speaking,\r\nwhich at times bordered closely upon eloquence. He was a lover of\r\nelegant simplicity, and was fond, not so much of profuse banquets, as of\r\nentertainments directed by good taste.\r\n\r\n5. Lastly, he was especially remarkable during his reign for his\r\nmoderation in this particular, that he kept a middle course between the\r\ndifferent sects of religion; and never troubled any one, nor issued any\r\norders in favour of one kind of worship or another; nor did he\r\npromulgate any threatening edicts to bow down the necks of his subjects\r\nto the form of worship to which he himself was inclined; but he left\r\nthese parties just as he found them, without making any alterations.\r\n\r\n6. His body was muscular and strong: the brightness of his hair--the\r\nbrilliancy of his complexion, with his blue eyes, which always looked\r\naskance with a stern aspect--the beauty of his figure--his lofty\r\nstature, and the admirable harmony of all his features--filled up the\r\ndignity and beauty of an appearance which bespoke a monarch.\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\n§ 1. After the last honours had been paid to the emperor, and his body\r\nhad been prepared for burial, in order to be sent to Constantinople to\r\nbe there entombed among the remains of former emperors, the campaign\r\nwhich was in preparation was suspended, and people began to be anxious\r\nas to what part would be taken by the Gallic cohorts, who were not\r\nalways steady in loyalty to the lawful emperor, but looked upon\r\nthemselves as the disposers of power, and were regarded by others as\r\nvery likely to venture on some new enterprise at so favourable a moment.\r\nThis circumstance also was likely to aid any attempt that might be made\r\nat a revolution, that Gratian, who knew nothing of what had taken place,\r\nwas still at Treves, where his father, when about to set out on his own\r\nexpedition, had desired him to wait.\r\n\r\n2. While affairs were in this state of uncertainty, and when every one\r\nshared the same fears, looking on themselves as all in the same boat,\r\nand sure to be partners in danger, if danger should arise, at last it\r\nwas decided by the advice of the principal nobles to take up the bridge\r\nwhich had been necessarily made when they meditated invading the\r\nterritories of the enemy, in order that, in compliance with the commands\r\ngiven by Valentinian while alive, Merobaudes might be at once summoned\r\nto the camp.\r\n\r\n3. He, being a man of great cunning and penetration, divined what had\r\nhappened (perhaps indeed he had been informed of it by the messenger who\r\nbrought him his summons), and suspecting that the Gallic troops were\r\nlikely to break the existing concord, he pretended that a token which\r\nhad been agreed upon had been sent to him that he was to return with the\r\nmessenger to watch the banks of the Rhine; since the fury of the\r\nbarbarians was again menacing hostilities, and (in compliance with a\r\nsecret injunction which he received, at the same time) he removed to a\r\ndistance. Sebastian also as yet was ignorant of the death of the\r\nemperor; and he being an orderly and quietly disposed man, but very\r\npopular among the soldiers, required on that account to be strictly\r\nwatched.\r\n\r\n4. Accordingly when Merobaudes had returned, the chief men took careful\r\ncounsel as to what was to be done; and at last it was arranged that the\r\nchild Valentinian, the son of the deceased emperor, at that time a boy\r\nof four years old, should be associated in the imperial power. He was at\r\npresent a hundred miles off, living with his mother, Justina, in a small\r\ntown called Murocincta.\r\n\r\n5. This decision was ratified by the unanimous consent of all parties;\r\nand Cerealis, his uncle, was sent with speed to Murocincta, where he\r\nplaced the royal child on a litter, and so conducted him to the camp.\r\nOn the sixth day after his father's death, he was declared lawful\r\nemperor, and saluted as Augustus with the usual solemnities.\r\n\r\n6. And although at the time many persons thought that Gratian would be\r\nindignant that any one else had been appointed emperor without his\r\npermission, yet afterwards, when all fear and anxiety was removed, they\r\nlived in greater security, because he, wise and kindhearted man as he\r\nwas, loved his young relative with exceeding affection, and brought him\r\nup with great care.\r\n\r\n\r\n[183] No one has succeeded in explaining this word. Some editors wish to\r\nread Suræ, explaining that as \"men picked out for their great strength,\"\r\nby a reference to Juvenal, xvi. 14--Grandes magna adsubsellia Suræ.\r\nWagner proposes to read Scurræ, a name sometimes given to the guards in\r\nthis age.\r\n\r\n[184] As at Athens, where the orators were only allowed to speak as long\r\nas an hour-glass, filled with water, was running down.\r\n\r\n[185] All these men are spoken of by Horace as distinguished lawyers in\r\nhis time.\r\n\r\n[186] See Cicero, de Oratore iii. 60.\r\n\r\n[187] The Speech of Cicero pro Coelio Cluentio.\r\n\r\n[188] The celebrated speech of Demosthenes, more usually known as that\r\nof De Coronâ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK XXXI.\r\n\r\nARGUMENT.\r\n\r\n     I. Omens announcing the death of the Emperor Valens, and a disaster\r\n     to be inflicted by the Gauls.--II. A description of the abodes and\r\n     customs of the Huns, the Alani, and other tribes, natives of\r\n     Asiatic Scythia.--III. The Huns, either by arms or by treaties,\r\n     unite the Alani on the Don to themselves; invade the Goths, and\r\n     drive them from their country.--IV. The chief division of the\r\n     Goths, surnamed the Thuringians, having been expelled from their\r\n     homes, by permission of Valens are conducted by the Romans into\r\n     Thrace, on condition of promising obedience and a supply of\r\n     auxiliary troops. The Gruthungi also, who form the other division\r\n     of the Goths, secretly cross the Danube by a bridge of boats.--V.\r\n     The Thuringians being in great distress from hunger and the want of\r\n     supplies, under the command of their generals Alavivus and\r\n     Fritigern, revolt from Valens, and defeat Lupicinus and his\r\n     army.--VI. Why Sueridus and Colias, nobles of the Gothic nation,\r\n     after having been received in a friendly manner, revolted; and\r\n     after slaying the people of Hadrianopolis, united themselves to\r\n     Fritigern, and then turned to ravage Thrace.--VII. Profuturus,\r\n     Trajan, and Richomeres fought a drawn battle against the\r\n     Goths.--VIII. The Goths being hemmed in among the defiles at the\r\n     bottom of the Balkan, after the Romans by returning had let them\r\n     escape, invaded Thrace, plundering, massacring, ravishing, and\r\n     burning, and slay Barzimeres, the tribune of the Scutarii.--IX.\r\n     Frigeridus, Gratian's general, routs Farnobius at the head of a\r\n     large body of Goths and Taifalæ; sparing the rest, and giving them\r\n     some lands around the Po.--X. The Lentiensian Alemanni are\r\n     defeated in battle by the generals of the emperor Gratian, and\r\n     their king Priamis is slain. Afterwards, having yielded and\r\n     furnished Gratian with a body of recruits, they are allowed to\r\n     return to their own country.--XI. Sebastian surprises the Goths at\r\n     Beræa as they are returning home loaded with plunder, and defeats\r\n     them with great slaughter; a few saved themselves by flight.\r\n     Gratian hastens to his uncle Valens, to carry him aid against the\r\n     Goths.--XII. Valens, before the arrival of Gratian resolves to\r\n     fight the Goths.--XIII. All the Goths unite together, that is to\r\n     say, the Thuringians, under their king Fritigern. The Gruthungi,\r\n     under their dukes Alatheus and Salaces, encounter the Romans in a\r\n     pitched battle, rout their cavalry, and then falling on the\r\n     infantry when deprived of the support of their horse, and huddled\r\n     together in a dense body, they defeat them with enormous loss, and\r\n     put them to flight. Valens is slain, but his body cannot be\r\n     found.--XIV. The virtues and vices of Valens.--XV. The victorious\r\n     Goths besiege Hadrianopolis, where Valens had left his treasures\r\n     and his insignia of imperial rank, with the prefect and the members\r\n     of his council; but after trying every means to take the city,\r\n     without success, they at last retire.--XVI. The Goths, having by\r\n     bribes won over the forces of the Huns and of the Alani to join\r\n     them, make an attack upon Constantinople without success. The\r\n     device by which Julius, the commander of the forces beyond Mount\r\n     Taurus, delivered the eastern provinces from the Goths.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nA.D. 375.\r\n\r\n§ 1. In the mean time the swift wheel of Fortune, which continually\r\nalternates adversity with prosperity, was giving Bellona the Furies for\r\nher allies, and arming her for war; and now transferred our disasters to\r\nthe East, as many presages and portents foreshowed by undoubted signs.\r\n\r\n2. For after many true prophecies uttered by diviners and augurs, dogs\r\nwere seen to recoil from howling wolves, and the birds of night\r\nconstantly uttered querulous and mournful cries; and lurid sunrises made\r\nthe mornings dark. Also, at Antioch, among the tumults and squabbles of\r\nthe populace, it had come to be a custom for any one who fancied himself\r\nill treated to cry out in a licentious manner, \"May Valens be burnt\r\nalive!\" And the voices of the criers were constantly heard ordering wood\r\nto be carried to warm the baths of Valens, which had been built under\r\nthe supertendence of the emperor himself.\r\n\r\n3. All which circumstances all but pointed out in express words that the\r\nend of the emperor's life was at hand. Besides all these things, the\r\nghost of the king of Armenia, and the miserable shades of those who had\r\nlately been put to death in the affair of Theodorus, agitated numbers of\r\npeople with terrible alarms, appearing to them in their sleep, and\r\nshrieking out verses of horrible import.[189]\r\n\r\n4. ... and its death indicated an extensive and general calamity arising\r\nfrom public losses and deaths. Last of all, when the ancient walls of\r\nChalcedon were thrown down in order to build a bath at Constantinople,\r\nand the stones were torn asunder, on one squared stone which was hidden\r\nin the very centre of the walls these Greek verses were found engraved,\r\nwhich gave a full revelation of what was to happen:--\r\n\r\n  +\"All hopotan nymphai droserê kata astu choreiê\r\n  Terpomenai strepsôntai eusteeiphas kat' aguias\r\n  Kai teichos loutroio polustonon essetai alkai\r\n  Dê tote myria phyla polyspereôn anthrôpôn\r\n  Istrou kallirooio poron peraônta syn aichmê\r\n  Kai Skythikên olesei chôrên kai Musida gaian\r\n  Paioniês d' epibanta syn syn elpisi mainomenêsin\r\n  Autou kai bioto o telos kai dêris ephexei.\"+\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION.\r\n\r\n  \"But when young wives and damsels blithe, in dances that delight,\r\n  Shall glide along the city streets, with garlands gaily bright;\r\n  And when these walls, with sad regrets, shall fall to raise a bath,\r\n  Then shall the Huns in multitude break forth with might and wrath.\r\n  By force of arms the barrier-stream of Ister they shall cross,\r\n  O'er Scythic ground and Moesian lands spreading dismay and loss:\r\n  They shall Pannonian horsemen brave, and Gallic soldiers slay,\r\n  And nought but loss of life and breath their course shall ever stay.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. The following circumstances were the original cause of all the\r\ndestruction and various calamities which the fury of Mars roused up,\r\nthrowing everything into confusion by his usual ruinous violence: the\r\npeople called Huns, slightly mentioned in the ancient records, live\r\nbeyond the Sea of Azov, on the border of the Frozen Ocean, and are a\r\nrace savage beyond all parallel.\r\n\r\n2. At the very moment of their birth the cheeks of their infant children\r\nare deeply marked by an iron, in order that the usual vigour of their\r\nhair, instead of growing at the proper season, may be withered by the\r\nwrinkled scars; and accordingly they grow up without beards, and\r\nconsequently without any beauty, like eunuchs, though they all have\r\nclosely-knit and strong limbs, and plump necks; they are of great size,\r\nand low legged, so that you might fancy them two-legged beasts, or the\r\nstout figures which are hewn out in a rude manner with an axe on the\r\nposts at the end of bridges.\r\n\r\n3. They are certainly in the shape of men, however uncouth, but are so\r\nhardy that they neither require fire nor well-flavoured food, but live\r\non the roots of such herbs as they get in the fields, or on the half-raw\r\nflesh of any animal, which they merely warm rapidly by placing it\r\nbetween their own thighs and the backs of their horses.\r\n\r\n4. They never shelter themselves under roofed houses, but avoid them as\r\npeople ordinarily avoid sepulchres as things not fitted for common use.\r\nNor is there even to be found among them a cabin thatched with reed; but\r\nthey wander about, roaming over the mountains and the woods and accustom\r\nthemselves to bear frost and hunger and thirst from their very cradles.\r\nAnd even when abroad they never enter a house unless under the\r\ncompulsion of some extreme necessity; nor, indeed, do they think people\r\nunder roofs as safe as others.\r\n\r\n5. They wear linen clothes, or else garments made of the skins of\r\nfield-mice: nor do they wear a different dress out of doors from that\r\nwhich they wear at home; but after a tunic is once put round their\r\nnecks, however it becomes worn, it is never taken off or changed till,\r\nfrom long decay, it becomes actually so ragged as to fall to pieces.\r\n\r\n6. They cover their heads with round caps, and their shaggy legs with\r\nthe skins of kids; their shoes are not made on any lasts, but are so\r\nunshapely as to hinder them from walking with a free gait. And for this\r\nreason they are not well suited to infantry battles, but are nearly\r\nalways on horseback, their horses being ill-shaped, but hardy; and\r\nsometimes they even sit upon them like women if they want to do anything\r\nmore conveniently. There is not a person in the whole nation who cannot\r\nremain on his horse day and night. On horseback they buy and sell, they\r\ntake their meat and drink, and there they recline on the narrow neck of\r\ntheir steed, and yield to sleep so deep as to indulge in every variety\r\nof dream.\r\n\r\n7. And when any deliberation is to take place on any weighty matter,\r\nthey all hold their common council on horseback. They are not under the\r\nauthority of a king, but are contented with the irregular government of\r\ntheir nobles, and under their lead they force their way through all\r\nobstacles.\r\n\r\n8. Sometimes when provoked, they fight; and when they go into battle,\r\nthey form in a solid body, and utter all kinds of terrific yells. They\r\nare very quick in their operations, of exceeding speed, and fond of\r\nsurprising their enemies. With a view to this, they suddenly disperse,\r\nthen reunite, and again, after having inflicted vast loss upon the\r\nenemy, scatter themselves over the whole plain in irregular formations:\r\nalways avoiding a fort or an entrenchment.\r\n\r\n9. And in one respect you may pronounce them the most formidable of all\r\nwarriors, for when at a distance they use missiles of various kinds\r\ntipped with sharpened bones instead of the usual points of javelins, and\r\nthese bones are admirably fastened into the shaft of the javelin or\r\narrow; but when they are at close quarters they fight with the sword,\r\nwithout any regard for their own safety; and often while their\r\nantagonists are warding off their blows they entangle them with twisted\r\ncords, so that, their hands being fettered, they lose all power of\r\neither riding or walking.\r\n\r\n10. None of them plough, or even touch a plough-handle: for they have no\r\nsettled abode, but are homeless and lawless, perpetually wandering with\r\ntheir waggons, which they make their homes; in fact they seem to be\r\npeople always in flight. Their wives live in these waggons, and there\r\nweave their miserable garments; and here too they sleep with their\r\nhusbands, and bring up their children till they reach the age of\r\npuberty; nor, if asked, can any one of them tell you where he was born,\r\nas he was conceived in one place, born in another at a great distance,\r\nand brought up in another still more remote.\r\n\r\n11. In truces they are treacherous and inconstant, being liable to\r\nchange their minds at every breeze of every fresh hope which presents\r\nitself, giving themselves up wholly to the impulse and inclination of\r\nthe moment; and, like brute beasts, they are utterly ignorant of the\r\ndistinction between right and wrong. They express themselves with great\r\nambiguity and obscurity; have no respect for any religion or\r\nsuperstition whatever; are immoderately covetous of gold; and are so\r\nfickle and irascible, that they very often on the same day that they\r\nquarrel with their companions without any provocation, again become\r\nreconciled to them without any mediator.\r\n\r\n12. This active and indomitable race, being excited by an unrestrainable\r\ndesire of plundering the possessions of others, went on ravaging and\r\nslaughtering all the nations in their neighbourhood till they reached\r\nthe Alani, who were formerly called the Massagetæ; and from what country\r\nthese Alani come, or what territories they inhabit (since my subject has\r\nled me thus far), it is expedient now to explain: after showing the\r\nconfusion existing in the accounts of the geographers, who ... at last\r\nhave found out ... of truth.\r\n\r\n13. The Danube, which is greatly increased by other rivers falling into\r\nit, passes through the territory of the Sauromatæ, which extends as far\r\nas the river Don, the boundary between Asia and Europe. On the other\r\nside of this river the Alani inhabit the enormous deserts of Scythia,\r\nderiving their own name from the mountains around; and they, like the\r\nPersians, having gradually subdued all the bordering nations by repeated\r\nvictories, have united them to themselves, and comprehended them under\r\ntheir own name. Of these other tribes the Neuri inhabit the inland\r\ndistricts, being near the highest mountain chains, which are both\r\nprecipitous and covered with the everlasting frost of the north. Next to\r\nthem are the Budini and the Geloni, a race of exceeding ferocity, who\r\nflay the enemies they have slain in battle, and make of their skins\r\nclothes for themselves and trappings for their horses. Next to the\r\nGeloni are the Agathyrsi, who dye both their bodies and their hair of a\r\nblue colour, the lower classes using spots few in number and small--the\r\nnobles broad spots, close and thick, and of a deeper hue.\r\n\r\n15. Next to these are the Melanchænæ and the Anthropophagi, who roam\r\nabout upon different tracts of land and live on human flesh. And these\r\nmen are so avoided on account of their horrid food, that all the tribes\r\nwhich were their neighbours have removed to a distance from them. And in\r\nthis way the whole of that region to the north-east, till you come to\r\nthe Chinese, is uninhabited.\r\n\r\n16. On the other side the Alani again extend to the east, near the\r\nterritories of the Amazons, and are scattered among many populous and\r\nwealthy nations, stretching to the parts of Asia which, as I am told,\r\nextend up to the Ganges, a river which passes through the country of the\r\nIndians, and falls into the Southern Ocean.\r\n\r\n17. Then the Alani, being thus divided among the two quarters of the\r\nglobe (the various tribes which make up the whole nation it is not worth\r\nwhile to enumerate), although widely separated, wander, like the\r\nNomades, over enormous districts. But in the progress of time all these\r\ntribes came to be united under one generic appellation, and are called\r\nAlani....\r\n\r\n18. They have no cottages, and never use the plough, but live solely on\r\nmeat and plenty of milk, mounted on their waggons, which they cover with\r\na curved awning made of the bark of trees, and then drive them through\r\ntheir boundless deserts. And when they come to any pasture-land, they\r\npitch their waggons in a circle, and live like a herd of beasts, eating\r\nup all the forage--carrying, as it were, their cities with them in their\r\nwaggons. In them the husbands sleep with their wives--in them their\r\nchildren are born and brought up; these waggons, in short, are their\r\nperpetual habitation, and wherever they fix them, that place they look\r\nupon as their home.\r\n\r\n19. They drive before them their flocks and herds to their pasturage;\r\nand, above all other cattle, they are especially careful of their\r\nhorses. The fields in that country are always green, and are\r\ninterspersed with patches of fruit trees, so that, wherever they go,\r\nthere is no dearth either of food for themselves or fodder for their\r\ncattle. And this is caused by the moisture of the soil, and the number\r\nof the rivers which flow through these districts.\r\n\r\n20. All their old people, and especially all the weaker sex, keep close\r\nto the waggons, and occupy themselves in the lighter employments. But\r\nthe young men, who from their earliest childhood are trained to the use\r\nof horses, think it beneath them to walk. They are also all trained by\r\ncareful discipline of various sorts to become skilful warriors. And this\r\nis the reason why the Persians, who are originally of Scythian\r\nextraction, are very skilful in war.\r\n\r\n21. Nearly all the Alani are men of great stature and beauty; their hair\r\nis somewhat yellow, their eyes are terribly fierce; the lightness of\r\ntheir armour renders them rapid in their movements; and they are in\r\nevery respect equal to the Huns, only more civilized in their food and\r\ntheir manner of life. They plunder and hunt as far as the Sea of Azov\r\nand the Cimmerian Bosphorus, ravaging also Armenia and Media.\r\n\r\n22. And as ease is a delightful thing to men of a quiet and placid\r\ndisposition, so danger and war are a pleasure to the Alani, and among\r\nthem that man is called happy who has lost his life in battle. For those\r\nwho grow old, or who go out of the world from accidental sicknesses,\r\nthey pursue with bitter reproaches as degenerate and cowardly. Nor is\r\nthere anything of which they boast with more pride than of having killed\r\na man: and the most glorious spoils they esteem the scalps which they\r\nhave torn from the heads of those whom they have slain, which they put\r\nas trappings and ornaments on their war horses.\r\n\r\n23. Not is there any temple or shrine seen in their country, nor even\r\nany cabin thatched with straw, their only idea of religion being to\r\nplunge a naked sword into the ground with barbaric ceremonies, and then\r\nthey worship that with great respect, as Mars, the presiding deity of\r\nthe regions over which they wander.\r\n\r\n24. They presage the future in a most remarkable manner; for they\r\ncollect a number of straight twigs of osier, then with certain secret\r\nincantations they separate them from one another on particular days; and\r\nfrom them they learn clearly what is about to happen.\r\n\r\n25. They have no idea of slavery, inasmuch as they themselves are all\r\nborn of noble families; and those whom even now they appoint to be\r\njudges are always men of proved experience and skill in war. But now let\r\nus return to the subject which we proposed to ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. Therefore the Huns, after having traversed the territories of the\r\nAlani, and especially of that tribe of them who border on the Gruthungi,\r\nand who are called Tanaitæ, and having slain many of them and acquired\r\nmuch plunder, they made a treaty of friendship and alliance with those\r\nwho remained. And when they had united them to themselves, with\r\nincreased boldness they made a sudden incursion into the extensive and\r\nfertile districts of Ermenrichus, a very warlike prince, and one whom\r\nhis numerous gallant actions of every kind had rendered formidable to\r\nall the neighbouring nations.\r\n\r\n2. He was astonished at the violence of this sudden tempest, and\r\nalthough, like a prince whose power was well established he long\r\nattempted to hold his ground, he was at last overpowered by a dread of\r\nthe evils impending over his country, which were exaggerated by common\r\nreport, till he terminated his fear of great danger by a voluntary\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n3. After his death Vithimiris was made king. He for some time maintained\r\na resistance to the Alani, relying on the aid of other tribes of the\r\nHuns, whom by large promises of pay he had won over to his party; but,\r\nafter having suffered many losses, he was defeated by superior numbers\r\nand slain in battle. He left an infant son named Viderichus, of whom\r\nAlatheus and Saphrax undertook the guardianship, both generals of great\r\nexperience and proved courage. And when they, yielding to the\r\ndifficulties of the crisis, had given up all hope of being able to make\r\nan effectual resistance, they retired with caution till they came to the\r\nriver Dniester, which lies between the Danube and the Dnieper, and flows\r\nthrough a vast extent of country.\r\n\r\n4. When Athanaric, the chief magistrate of the Thuringians (against\r\nwhom, as I have already mentioned, Valens had begun to wage war, to\r\npunish him for having sent assistance to Procopius), had become informed\r\nof these unexpected occurrences, he prepared to maintain his ground,\r\nwith a resolution to rise up in strength should he be assailed as the\r\nothers had been.\r\n\r\n5. At last he pitched his camp at a distance in a very favourable spot\r\nnear the banks of the Dniester and the valleys of the Gruthungi, and\r\nsent Muderic, who afterwards became Duke of the Arabian frontier, with\r\nLagarimanus and others of the nobles, with orders to advance for twenty\r\nmiles, to reconnoitre the approach of the enemy while in the mean time\r\nhe himself, without delay, marshalled his troops in line of battle.\r\n\r\n6. However, things turned out in a manner very contrary to his\r\nexpectations. For the Huns (being very sagacious in conjectures)\r\nsuspecting that there must be a considerable multitude further off,\r\ncontrived to pass beyond those they had seen, and arranged themselves to\r\ntake their rest where there was nothing at hand to disturb them; and\r\nthen, when the moon dispelled the darkness of night, they forded the\r\nriver, which was the best plan that presented itself, and fearing lest\r\nthe piquets at the outposts might give the alarm to the distant camp,\r\nthey made all possible speed and advanced with the hope of surprising\r\nAthanaric himself.\r\n\r\n7. He was stupefied at the suddenness of their onset, and after losing\r\nmany of his men, was compelled to flee for refuge to the precipitous\r\nmountains in the neighbourhood, where, being wholly bewildered with the\r\nstrangeness of this occurrence, and the fear of greater evils to come,\r\nhe began to fortify with lofty walls all the territory between the banks\r\nof the river Pruth and the Danube, where it passes through the lands of\r\nthe Taifali, and he completed this line of fortification with great\r\ndiligence, thinking that by this step he should secure his own personal\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\n8. While this important work was going on, the Huns kept pressing on his\r\ntraces with great speed, and they would have overtaken and destroyed him\r\nif they had not been forced to abandon the pursuit from being impeded by\r\nthe great quantity of their booty. In the mean time a report spread\r\nextensively through the other nations of the Goths, that a race of men,\r\nhitherto unknown, had suddenly descended like a whirlwind from the lofty\r\nmountains, as if they had risen from some secret recess of the earth,\r\nand were ravaging and destroying everything which came in their way. And\r\nthen the greater part of the population which, because of their want of\r\nnecessaries had deserted Athanaric, resolved to flee and to seek a home\r\nremote from all knowledge of the barbarians; and after a long\r\ndeliberation where to fix their abode, they resolved that a retreat into\r\nThrace was the most suitable for these two reasons: first of all,\r\nbecause it is a district most fertile in grass; and also because, by the\r\ngreat breadth of the Danube, it is wholly separated from the barbarians,\r\nwho were already exposed to the thunderbolts of foreign warfare. And the\r\nwhole population of the tribe adopted this resolution unanimously.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nA.D. 376.\r\n\r\n§ 1. Accordingly, under the command of their leader Alavivus, they\r\noccupied the banks of the Danube; and having sent ambassadors to Valens,\r\nthey humbly entreated to be received by him as his subjects, promising\r\nto live quietly, and to furnish a body of auxiliary troops if any\r\nnecessity for such a force should arise.\r\n\r\n2. While these events were passing in foreign countries, a terrible\r\nrumour arose that the tribes of the north were planning new and\r\nunprecedented attacks upon us: and that over the whole region which\r\nextends from the country of the Marcomanni and Quadi to Pontus, a\r\nbarbarian host composed of different distant nations, which had suddenly\r\nbeen driven by force from their own country, was now, with all their\r\nfamilies, wandering about in different directions on the banks of the\r\nriver Danube.\r\n\r\n3. At first this intelligence was lightly treated by our people, because\r\nthey were not in the habit of hearing of any wars in those remote\r\ndistricts till they were terminated either by victory or by treaty.\r\n\r\n4. But presently, as the belief in these occurrences grew stronger,\r\nbeing confirmed, too, by the arrival of the foreign ambassadors, who,\r\nwith prayers and earnest entreaties, begged that the people thus driven\r\nfrom their homes and now encamped on the other side of the river, might\r\nbe kindly received by us, the affair seemed a cause of joy rather than\r\nof fear, according to the skilful flatterers who were always extolling\r\nand exaggerating the good fortune of the emperor; congratulating him\r\nthat an embassy had come from the furthest corners of the earth\r\nunexpectedly, offering him a large body of recruits; and that, by\r\ncombining the strength of his own nation with these foreign forces, he\r\nwould have an army absolutely invincible; observing further that, by the\r\nyearly payment for military reinforcements which came in every year from\r\nthe provinces, a vast treasure of gold might be accumulated in his\r\ncoffers.\r\n\r\n5. Full of this hope he sent forth several officers to bring this\r\nferocious people and their waggons into our territory. And such great\r\npains were taken to gratify this nation which was destined to overthrow\r\nthe empire of Rome, that not one was left behind, not even of those who\r\nwere stricken with mortal disease. Moreover, having obtained permission\r\nof the emperor to cross the Danube and to cultivate some districts in\r\nThrace, they crossed the stream day and night, without ceasing,\r\nembarking in troops on board ships and rafts, and canoes made of the\r\nhollow trunks of trees, in which enterprise, as the Danube is the most\r\ndifficult of all rivers to navigate, and was at that time swollen with\r\ncontinual rains, a great many were drowned, who, because they were too\r\nnumerous for the vessels, tried to swim across, and in spite of all\r\ntheir exertions were swept away by the stream.\r\n\r\n6. In this way, through the turbulent zeal of violent people, the ruin\r\nof the Roman empire was brought on. This, at all events, is neither\r\nobscure nor uncertain, that the unhappy officers who were intrusted with\r\nthe charge of conducting the multitude of the barbarians across the\r\nriver, though they repeatedly endeavoured to calculate their numbers, at\r\nlast abandoned the attempt as hopeless: and the man who would wish to\r\nascertain the number might as well (as the most illustrious of\r\npoets[190] says) attempt to count the waves in the African sea, or the\r\ngrains of sand tossed about by the zephyr.\r\n\r\n7. Let, however, the ancient annals be accredited which record that the\r\nPersian host which was led into Greece, was, while encamped on the\r\nshores of the Hellespont, and making a new and artificial sea,[191]\r\nnumbered in battalions at Doriscus; a computation which has been\r\nunanimously regarded by all posterity as fabulous.\r\n\r\n8. But after the innumerable multitudes of different nations, diffused\r\nover all our provinces, and spreading themselves over the vast expanse\r\nof our plains, who filled all the champaign country and all the mountain\r\nranges, are considered, the credibility of the ancient accounts is\r\nconfirmed by this modern instance. And first of all Fritigern was\r\nreceived with Alavivus; and the emperor assigned them a temporary\r\nprovision for their immediate support, and ordered lands to be assigned\r\nthem to cultivate.\r\n\r\n9. At that time the defences of our provinces were much exposed, and the\r\narmies of barbarians spread over them like the lava of Mount Etna. The\r\nimminence of our danger manifestly called for generals already\r\nillustrious for their past achievements in war: but nevertheless, as if\r\nsome unpropitious deity had made the selection, the men who were sought\r\nout for the chief military appointments were of tainted character. The\r\nchief among them were Lupicinus and Maximus, the one being Count of\r\nThrace, the other a leader notoriously wicked--and both men of great\r\nignorance and rashness.\r\n\r\n10. And their treacherous covetousness was the cause of all our\r\ndisasters. For (to pass over other matters in which the officers\r\naforesaid, or others with their unblushing connivance, displayed the\r\ngreatest profligacy in their injurious treatment of the foreigners\r\ndwelling in our territory, against whom no crime could be alleged) this\r\none melancholy and unprecedented piece of conduct (which, even if they\r\nwere to choose their own judges, must appear wholly unpardonable) must\r\nbe mentioned.\r\n\r\n11. When the barbarians who had been conducted across the river were in\r\ngreat distress from want of provisions, those detested generals\r\nconceived the idea of a most disgraceful traffic: and having collected\r\nhounds from all quarters with the most insatiable rapacity, they\r\nexchanged them for an equal number of slaves, among whom were several\r\nsons of men of noble birth.\r\n\r\n12. About this time also, Vitheric, the king of the Gruthungi, with\r\nAlatheus and Saphrax, by whose influence he was mainly guided, and also\r\nwith Farnobius, approached the bank of the Danube, and sent envoys to\r\nthe emperor to entreat that he also might be received with the same\r\nkindness that Alavivus and Fritigern had experienced.\r\n\r\n13. But when, as seemed best for the interests of the state, these\r\nambassadors had been rejected, and were in great anxiety as to what they\r\nshould do, Athanaric, fearing similar treatment, departed; recollecting\r\nthat long ago when he was discussing a treaty of alliance with Valens,\r\nhe had treated that emperor with contempt, in affirming that he was\r\nbound by a religious obligation never to set his foot on the Roman\r\nterritory; and that by this excuse he had compelled the emperor to\r\nconclude a peace in the middle of the war. And he, fearing that the\r\ngrudge which Valens bore him for this conduct was still lasting,\r\nwithdrew with all his forces to Caucalandes, a place which, from the\r\nheight of its mountains and the thickness of its woods, is completely\r\ninaccessible; and from which he had lately driven out the Sarmatians.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n§ 1. But the Thuringians, though they had some time since received\r\npermission to cross the river, were still wandering up and down the\r\nbanks, being hindered by a twofold obstacle; first, that in consequence\r\nof the mischievous dissimulation of the said generals they were not\r\nsupplied with the necessary provisions; and also because they were\r\ndesignedly detained that they might the more easily be plundered under\r\nthe wicked semblance of traffic.\r\n\r\n2. And when they ascertained these facts, they began to grumble, and\r\nproposed to resist the evils which they apprehended from the treachery\r\nof these men by open force; and Lupicinus, who feared that they would\r\nresist, brought up his troops close to them, in order to compel them to\r\nbe gone with all possible rapidity.\r\n\r\n3. The Gruthungi seized this as a favourable opportunity, and seeing\r\nthat the Roman soldiers were occupied in another quarter, and that the\r\nvessels which used to go up and down, to prevent them from crossing,\r\nwere now stationary, crossed the river on roughly-made rafts, and\r\npitched their camp at a great distance from Fritigern.\r\n\r\n4. But he, by his innate foresight, provided against everything that\r\ncould happen, and marching on slowly as well in obedience to the\r\ncommands he had received as to allow time for other powerful kings to\r\njoin him, came by slow marches to Marcianopolis, arriving later than he\r\nwas expected. And here another atrocious occurrence took place, which\r\nkindled the torches of the Furies for general calamity.\r\n\r\n5. Alavivus and Fritigern were invited to a banquet; while Lupicinus\r\ndrew up his soldiers against the chief host of the barbarians, and so\r\nkept them at a distance from the walls of the town; though they with\r\nhumble perseverance implored admission in order so to procure necessary\r\nprovisions, professing themselves loyal and obedient subjects. At last a\r\nserious strife arose between the citizens and the strangers who were\r\nthus refused admittance, which gradually led to a regular battle. And\r\nthe barbarians, being excited to an unusual pitch of ferocity when they\r\nsaw their relations treated as enemies, began to plunder the soldiers\r\nwhom they had slain.\r\n\r\n6. But when Lupicinus, of whom we have already spoken, learnt by secret\r\nintelligence that this was taking place, while he was engaged in an\r\nextravagant entertainment, surrounded by buffoons, and almost overcome\r\nby wine and sleep, he, fearing the issue, put to death all the guards\r\nwho, partly as a compliment and partly as a guard to the chiefs, were on\r\nduty before the general's tent.\r\n\r\n7. The people who were still around the walls heard of this with great\r\nindignation, and rising up by degrees into a resolution to avenge their\r\nkings, who, as they fancied, were being detained as prisoners, broke out\r\nwith furious threats. And Fritigern, being a man of great readiness of\r\nresource, and fearing that perhaps he might be detained with the rest as\r\na hostage, exclaimed that there would be a terrible and destructive\r\nconflict if he were not allowed to go forth with his companions in order\r\nto pacify the multitude, who he said had broken out in this tumult from\r\nbelieving that their leaders had been trepanned and murdered under show\r\nof courtesy. Having obtained permission, they all went forth, and were\r\nreceived with cheers and great delight; they then mounted their horses\r\nand fled, in order to kindle wars in many quarters.\r\n\r\n8. When Fame, ever the malignant nurse of bad news, bruited this\r\nabroad, the whole nation of the Thuringians became suddenly inflamed\r\nwith a desire for war; and among many preparations which seemed to\r\nbetoken danger, the standards of war were raised according to custom,\r\nand the trumpets poured forth sounds of evil omen; while the predatory\r\nbands collected in troops plundering and burning villages, and throwing\r\neverything that came in their way into alarm by their fearful\r\ndevastations.\r\n\r\n9. Against these hosts, Lupicinus, having collected his forces with the\r\ngreatest possible rapidity, advanced with more rashness than prudence,\r\nand halted in battle array nine miles from the city. The barbarians,\r\nperceiving this, charged our battalions before we expected them, and\r\ndashing upon the shields with which they covered their bodies, they cut\r\ndown all who fell in their way with their swords and spears; and urged\r\non by their bloodthirsty fury, they continued the slaughter, till they\r\nhad taken our standards, and the tribunes and the greater part of the\r\nsoldiers had fallen, with the exception of the unhappy general, who\r\ncould find nothing to do but, while all the rest were fighting, to\r\nbetake himself to flight, and return full gallop to the city. And then\r\nthe enemies, clothing themselves in the arms of the Romans whom they had\r\nslain, pushed on their devastating march without hindrance.\r\n\r\n10. And since, after recounting various other exploits, we have now come\r\nto this portion of our subject, we call upon our readers (if we shall\r\never have any) not to expect a minute detail of everything that took\r\nplace, or of the number of the slain, which indeed it would be utterly\r\nimpossible to give. It will be sufficient to abstain from concealing any\r\npart of the truth by a lie, and to give the general outline of what took\r\nplace: since a faithful honesty of narration is always proper if one\r\nwould hand events down to the recollection of posterity.\r\n\r\n11. Those who are ignorant of antiquity declare that the republic was\r\nnever so overwhelmed with the darkness of adverse fortune; but they are\r\ndeceived in consequence of the stupor into which they are thrown by\r\nthese calamities, which are still fresh in their memory. For if the\r\nevents of former ages, or even of those immediately preceding our own\r\ntimes are considered, it will be plain that such melancholy events have\r\noften happened, of which I will bring to mind several instances.\r\n\r\n12. The Teutones and the Cimbri came suddenly from the remote shores of\r\nthe ocean, and overran Italy; but, after having inflicted enormous\r\ndisasters on the Roman republic, they were at last overcome by our\r\nillustrious generals, and being wholly vanquished, learnt by their\r\nultimate destruction what martial valour, combined with skill, can\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n13. Again, in the reign of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius, the insane fury\r\nof a number of different nations combined together, after fearful wars\r\n... would have left but a small part of them.\r\n\r\n14. But, soon after these calamitous losses, the state was\r\nre-established in all its former strength and prosperity; because the\r\nsoberness of our ancestry had not yet become infected with the luxury\r\nand softness of a more effeminate way of life, and had not learnt to\r\nindulge in splendid banquets, or the criminal acquisition of riches. But\r\nboth the highest classes and the lowest living in harmony, and imbued\r\nwith one unanimous spirit, eagerly embraced a glorious death in the\r\ncause of the republic as a tranquil and quiet haven.\r\n\r\n15. The great multitudes of the Scythian nations, having burst through\r\nthe Bosphorus, and made their way to the shores of the Sea of Azov with\r\n2000 ships, inflicted fearful losses on us by land and sea; but also\r\nlost a great portion of their own men, and so at last returned to their\r\nown country.\r\n\r\n16. Those great generals, the Decii, father and son, fell fighting\r\nagainst the barbarians. The cities of Pamphylia were besieged, many\r\nislands were laid waste; Macedon was ravaged with fire and sword. An\r\nenormous host for a long time blockaded Thessalonica and Cyzicus. Arabia\r\nalso was taken; and so at the same time was Nicopolis, which had been\r\nbuilt by the Emperor Trajan as a monument of his victory over the\r\nDacians.\r\n\r\n17. After many fearful losses had been both sustained and inflicted\r\nPhilippopolis was destroyed, and, unless our annals speak falsely,\r\n100,000 men were slaughtered within its walls. Foreign enemies roved\r\nunrestrained over Epirus, and Thessaly, and the whole of Greece; but\r\nafter that glorious general Claudius had been taken as a colleague in\r\nthe empire (though again lost to us by an honourable death), the enemy\r\nwas routed by Aurelian, an untiring leader, and a severe avenger of\r\ninjuries; and after that they remained quiet for a long time without\r\nattempting anything, except that some bands of robbers now and then\r\nranged the districts in their own neighbourhood, always, however, to\r\ntheir own injury. And now I will return to the main history from which I\r\nhave digressed.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n§ 1. When this series of occurrences had been made generally known by\r\nfrequent messengers, Sueridus and Colias, two nobles of the Goths, who\r\nhad some time before been friendly received with their people, and had\r\nbeen sent to Hadrianople to pass the winter in that city, thinking their\r\nown safety the most important of all objects, looked on all the events\r\nwhich were taking place with great indifference.\r\n\r\n2. But, on a sudden, letters having arrived from the emperor, in which\r\nthey were ordered to cross over to the province of the Hellespont, they\r\nasked, in a very modest manner, to be provided with money to defray the\r\nexpenses of their march, as well as provisions, and to be allowed a\r\nrespite of two days. But the chief magistrate of the city was indignant\r\nat this request, being also out of humour with them on account of some\r\ninjury which had been done to property of his own in the suburbs, and\r\ncollected a great mob of the lowest of the people, with a body of\r\narmourers, of whom there is a great number in that place, and led them\r\nforth armed to hasten the departure of the Goths. And ordering the\r\ntrumpeters to sound an alarm, he menaced them with destruction unless\r\nthey at once departed with all speed, as they had been ordered.\r\n\r\n3. The Goths, bewildered by this unexpected calamity, and alarmed at\r\nthis outbreak of the citizens, which looked more as if caused by a\r\nsudden impulse than by any deliberate purpose, stood without moving. And\r\nbeing assailed beyond all endurance by reproaches and manifestations of\r\nill will, and also by occasional missiles, they at last broke out into\r\nopen revolt; having slain several of those who had at first attacked\r\nthem with too much petulance, and having put the rest to flight, and\r\nwounded many with all kinds of weapons, they stripped their corpses and\r\narmed themselves with the spoils in the Roman fashion; and then, seeing\r\nFritigern near them, they united themselves to him as obedient allies,\r\nand blockaded the city. They remained some time, maintaining this\r\ndifficult position and making promiscuous attacks, during which they\r\nlost some of their number by their own audacity, without being able to\r\navenge them; while many were slain by arrows and large stones hurled\r\nfrom slings.\r\n\r\n4. Then Fritigern, perceiving that his men, who were unaccustomed to\r\nsieges, were struggling in vain, and sustaining heavy losses, advised\r\nhis army to leave a force sufficient to maintain the blockade, and to\r\ndepart with the rest, acknowledging their failure, and saying that \"He\r\ndid not war with stone walls.\" Advising them also to lay waste all the\r\nfertile regions around without any distinction, and to plunder those\r\nplaces which were not defended by any garrisons.\r\n\r\n5. His counsel was approved, as his troops knew that he was always a\r\nvery able commander in bringing their plans to success; and then they\r\ndispersed over the whole district of Thrace, advancing cautiously; while\r\nthose who came of their own accord to surrender, or those whom they had\r\ntaken prisoners, pointed out to them the richest towns, and especially\r\nthose where it was said that supplies of provisions could be found. And\r\nin addition to their natural confidence they were greatly encouraged by\r\nthis circumstance, that a multitude of that nation came in daily to join\r\nthem who had formerly been sold as slaves by the merchants, with many\r\nothers whom, when at their first passage of the river they were\r\nsuffering from severe want, they had bartered for a little bad wine or\r\nmorsels of bread.\r\n\r\n6. To these were added no inconsiderable number of men skilled in\r\ntracing out veins of gold, but who were unable to endure the heavy\r\nburden of their taxes; and who, having been received with the cheerful\r\nconsent of all, they were of great use to them while traversing strange\r\ndistricts--showing them the secret stores of grain, the retreats of men,\r\nand other hiding-places of divers kinds.\r\n\r\n7. Nor while these men led them on as their guides did anything remain\r\nuntouched by them, except what was inaccessible or wholly out of the\r\nway; for without any distinction of age or sex they went forward\r\ndestroying everything in one vast slaughter and conflagration: tearing\r\ninfants even from their mother's breast and slaying them; ravishing\r\ntheir mothers; slaughtering women's husbands before the eyes of those\r\nwhom they thus made widows; while boys of tender and of adult age were\r\ndragged over the corpses of their parents.\r\n\r\n8. Lastly, numbers of old men, crying out that they had lived long\r\nenough, having lost all their wealth, together with beautiful women, had\r\ntheir hands bound behind their back, and were driven into banishment,\r\nbewailing the ashes of their native homes.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nA.D. 377.\r\n\r\n§ 1. This news from Thrace was received with great sorrow, and caused\r\nthe Emperor Valens much anxiety.[192] He instantly sent Victor, the\r\ncommander of the cavalry, into Persia, to make such arrangements in\r\nArmenia as were required by the impending danger. While he himself\r\nprepared at once to quit Antioch and go to Constantinople, sending\r\nbefore him Profuturus and Trajan, both officers of rank and ambition,\r\nbut of no great skill in war.\r\n\r\n2. When they arrived at the place where it seemed most expedient to\r\ncombat this hostile multitude in detail and by ambuscades and surprises,\r\nthey very injudiciously adopted the ill-considered plan of opposing the\r\nlegions which had arrived from Armenia to barbarians who were still\r\nraging like madmen. Though the legions had repeatedly proved equal to\r\nthe dangers of a pitched battle and regular warfare, they were not\r\nsuited to encounter an innumerable host which occupied all the chains of\r\nthe lofty hills, and also all the plains.\r\n\r\n3. Our men had never yet experienced what can be effected by\r\nindomitable rage united with despair, and so having driven back the\r\nenemy beyond the abrupt precipices of the Balkan, they seized upon the\r\nrugged defiles in order to hem in the barbarians on ground from which\r\nthey would be unable to find any exit, and where it seemed they might be\r\novercome by famine. They themselves intended to await the arrival of\r\nFrigeridus, the duke, who was hastening towards them with the\r\nauxiliaries from Pannonia and other countries, and whom, at the request\r\nof Valens, Gratian had commanded to march to the camp to aid those who\r\nwere menaced with total destruction.\r\n\r\n4. After him, Richomeres, at that time count of the domestics, who also,\r\nby the command of Gratian, had moved forwards from Gaul, hastened\r\ntowards Thrace,[193] bringing with him some cohorts, which were cohorts\r\nin name, though the greater portion of them had already deserted (if we\r\nwould believe some people), by the persuasion of Merobaudes, fearing\r\nlest Gaul, now divested of all the troops, would be ravaged without\r\ncheck after the barbarians had forced the passage of the Rhine.\r\n\r\n5. But Frigeridus was prevented from moving by the gout, or at all\r\nevents (as some of his malicious detractors represented it), he pleaded\r\nsickness as an excuse for not being present in the struggles which were\r\nexpected, and so Richomeres, being unanimously called to the chief\r\ncommand, with Profuturus and Trajan for his colleagues, advanced towards\r\nthe town of Salices--at no great distance from which was a countless\r\nhost of barbarians, arranged in a circle, with a great multitude of\r\nwaggons for a rampart around them, behind which, as if protected by a\r\nspacious wall, they enjoyed ease and an abundance of booty.\r\n\r\n6. Filled with hopes of success, the Roman generals--resolved on some\r\ngallant enterprise should fortune afford them an opportunity--were\r\ncarefully watching the movements of the Goths! having formed the\r\ndesign--if they moved their camp in any other direction, which they were\r\nvery much in the habit of doing--to fall upon their rear, making no\r\ndoubt that they should slay many of them, and recover a great portion of\r\ntheir spoil.\r\n\r\n7. When the barbarians learnt this, probably through the information of\r\nsome deserter, from whom they obtained a knowledge of our operations,\r\nthey remained for some time in the same place; but at last, being\r\ninfluenced by fear of the opposing army, and of the reinforcements which\r\nmight be expected to throng to them, they assembled, by a preconcerted\r\nsignal, the predatory bands dispersed in different districts, and which,\r\nthe moment they received the orders of their leaders, returned like\r\nfirebrands, with the swiftness of birds, to their \"encampment of\r\nchariots\" (as they call it), and thus gave their countrymen confidence\r\nto attempt greater enterprises.\r\n\r\n8. After this there was no cessation of hostilities between the two\r\nparties except what was afforded by a few short truces; for after those\r\nmen had returned to the camp whom necessity had forced to quit it, the\r\nwhole body which was crowded within the circuit of the encampment, being\r\nfull of fierce discontent, excitement, and a most ferocious spirit, and\r\nnow reduced to the greatest extremities, were eager for bloodshed: nor\r\ndid their chiefs, who were present with them, resist their desire; and\r\nas the resolution to give battle was taken when the sun was sinking, and\r\nwhen the approach of night invited the sullen and discontented troops to\r\nrest, they took some food quietly, but remained all night sleepless.\r\n\r\n9. On the other hand the Romans, knowing what was going on, kept\r\nthemselves also awake, fearing the enemy and their insane leaders as so\r\nmany furious wild beasts: nevertheless, with fearless minds they awaited\r\nthe result, which, though they acknowledged it to be doubtful in respect\r\nof their inferiority in number, they still trusted would be propitious\r\nbecause of the superior justice of their cause.\r\n\r\n10. Therefore the next day, as soon as it was light, the signal for\r\ntaking arms having been given by the trumpets on both sides, the\r\nbarbarians, after having, in accordance with their usual custom, taken\r\nan oath to remain faithful to their standards, attempted to gain the\r\nhigher ground, in order that from it they might descend down the steep\r\nlike wheels, overwhelming their enemy by the vigour of their attack.\r\nWhen this was seen, our soldiers all flocked to their proper regiments,\r\nand then stood firm, neither turning aside nor in any instance even\r\nleaving their ranks to rush forward.\r\n\r\n11. Therefore when the armies on both sides, advancing more cautiously,\r\nat last halted and stood immovable, the warriors, with mutual sternness,\r\nsurveying each other with fierce looks. The Romans in every part of\r\ntheir line sang warlike songs, with a voice rising from a lower to a\r\nhigher key, which they call barritus,[194] and so encouraged themselves\r\nto gallant exertions. But the barbarians, with dissonant clamour,\r\nshouted out the praises of their ancestors, and amid their various\r\ndiscordant cries, tried occasional light skirmishes.\r\n\r\n12. And now each army began to assail the other with javelins and other\r\nsimilar missiles; and then with threatening shouts rushed on to close\r\ncombat, and packing their shields together like a testudo, they came\r\nfoot to foot with their foes. The barbarians, active, and easily\r\nrallied, hurled huge bludgeons, burnt at one end, against our men, and\r\nvigorously thrust their swords against the opposing breasts of the\r\nRomans, till they broke our left wing; but as it recoiled, it fell back\r\non a strong body of reserve which was vigorously brought up on their\r\nflank, and supported them just as they were on the very point of\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\n13. Therefore, while the battle raged with vast slaughter, each\r\nindividual soldier rushing fiercely on the dense ranks of the enemy, the\r\narrows and javelins flew like hail; the blows of swords were equally\r\nrapid; while the cavalry, too, pressed on, cutting down all who fled\r\nwith terrible and mighty wounds on their backs; as also on both sides\r\ndid the infantry, slaughtering and hamstringing those who had fallen\r\ndown, and through fear were unable to fly.\r\n\r\n14. And when the whole place was filled with corpses, some also lay\r\namong them still half alive, vainly cherishing a hope of life, some of\r\nthem having been pierced with bullets hurled from slings, others with\r\narrows barbed with iron. Some again had their heads cloven in half with\r\nblows of swords, so that one side of their heads hung down on each\r\nshoulder in a most horrible manner.\r\n\r\n15. Meanwhile, stubborn as the conflict was, neither party was wearied,\r\nbut they still fought on with equal valour and equal fortune, nor did\r\nany one relax in his sternness as long as his courage could give him\r\nstrength for exertion. But at last the day yielded to the evening, and\r\nput an end to the deadly contest: the barbarians all withdrew, in no\r\norder, each taking his own path, and our men returned sorrowfully to\r\ntheir tents.\r\n\r\n16. Then having paid the honours of burial to some among the dead, as\r\nwell as the time and place permitted, the rest of the corpses were left\r\nas a banquet to the ill-omened birds, which at that time were accustomed\r\nto feed on carcases--as is even now shown by the places which are still\r\nwhite with bones. It is quite certain that the Romans, who were\r\ncomparatively few, and contending with vastly superior numbers, suffered\r\nserious losses, while at the same time the barbarians did not escape\r\nwithout much lamentable slaughter.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. Upon the melancholy termination of this battle, our men sought a\r\nretreat in the neighbouring city of Marcianopolis. The Goths, of their\r\nown accord, fell back behind the ramparts formed by their waggons, and\r\nfor seven days they never once ventured to come forth or show\r\nthemselves. So our soldiers, seizing the opportunity, raised a barrier,\r\nand shut in some other vast multitudes of the barbarians among the\r\ndefiles of the Balkan, in hope, forsooth, that this destructive host\r\nbeing thus hemmed in between the Danube and the desert, and having no\r\nroad by which to escape, must perish by famine, since everything which\r\ncould serve to sustain life had been conveyed into the fortified cities,\r\nand these cities were safe from any attempt of the barbarians to besiege\r\nthem, since they were wholly ignorant of the use of warlike engines.\r\n\r\n2. After this Richomeres returned to Gaul, to convey reinforcements to\r\nthat country, where a fresh war of greater importance than ever, was\r\nanticipated. These events took place in the fourth consulship of\r\nGratian, and the first of Merobaudes, towards the autumn of the year.\r\n\r\n3. In the mean time Valens, having heard of the miserable result of\r\nthese wars and devastations, gave Saturninus the command of the\r\ncavalry, and sent him to carry aid to Trajan and Profuturus.\r\n\r\n4. At that time, throughout the whole countries of Scythia and Moesia,\r\neverything which could be eaten had been consumed; and so, urged equally\r\nby their natural ferocity and by hunger, the barbarians made desperate\r\nefforts to force their way out of the position in which they were\r\nenclosed but though they made frequent attempts, they were constantly\r\noverwhelmed by the vigour of our men, who made an effectual resistance\r\nby the aid of the rugged ground which they occupied; and at last, being\r\nreduced to the extremity of distress, they allured some of the Huns and\r\nAlani to their alliance by the hope of extensive plunder.\r\n\r\n5. When this was known, Saturninus (for by this time he had arrived and\r\nwas busy in arranging the outposts and military stations in the country)\r\ngradually collected his men, and was preparing to retreat, in pursuance\r\nof a sufficiently well-devised plan, lest the multitude of barbarians by\r\nsome sudden movement (like a river which had burst its barriers by the\r\nviolence of a flood) should easily overthrow his whole force, which had\r\nnow been for some time watching the place from which danger was\r\nsuspected.\r\n\r\n6. The moment that, by the seasonable retreat of our men, the passage of\r\nthese defiles was opened, the barbarians, in no regular order, but\r\nwherever each individual could find a passage, rushed forth without\r\nhindrance to spread confusion among us; and raging with a desire for\r\ndevastation and plunder, spread themselves with impunity over the whole\r\nregion of Thrace, from the districts watered by the Danube, to Mount\r\nRhodope and the strait which separates the Ægean from the Black Sea,\r\nspreading ravage, slaughter, bloodshed, and conflagration, and throwing\r\neverything into the foulest disorder by all sorts of acts of violence\r\ncommitted even on the free-born.\r\n\r\n7. Then one might see, with grief, actions equally horrible to behold\r\nand to speak of: women panic-stricken, beaten with cracking scourges;\r\nsome even in pregnancy, whose very offspring, before they were born, had\r\nto endure countless horrors: here were seen children twining round their\r\nmothers; there one might hear the lamentations of noble youths and\r\nmaidens all seized and doomed to captivity.\r\n\r\n8. Again, grown-up virgins and chaste matrons were dragged along with\r\ncountenances disfigured by bitter weeping, wishing to avoid the\r\nviolation of their modesty by any death however agonizing. Here some\r\nwealthy nobleman was dragged along like a wild beast, complaining, of\r\nfortune as merciless and blind, who in a brief moment had stripped him\r\nof his riches, of his beloved relations, and his home; had made him see\r\nhis house reduced to ashes, and had reduced him to expect either to be\r\ntorn limb from limb himself, or else to be exposed to scourging and\r\ntorture, as the slave of a ferocious conqueror.\r\n\r\n9. But the barbarians, like beasts who had broken loose from their\r\ncages, pouring unrestrainedly over the vast extent of country, marched\r\nupon a town called Dibaltum, where they found Barzimeres, a tribune of\r\nthe Scutarii, with his battalion, and some of the Cornuti legion, and\r\nseveral other bodies of infantry pitching a camp, like a veteran general\r\nof great experience as he was.\r\n\r\n10. Instantly (as the only means of avoiding immediate destruction) he\r\nordered the trumpet to give the signal for battle; and strengthening his\r\nflanks, rushed forward with his little army in perfect order. And he\r\nmade so gallant a struggle, that the barbarians would have obtained no\r\nadvantage over him, if a strong body of cavalry had not come round upon\r\nhim from behind, while his men were panting and weary with their\r\nexertions: so at last he fell, but not without having inflicted great\r\nslaughter on the barbarians, though the vastness of their numbers made\r\ntheir losses less observed.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\n§ 1. After this affair had terminated, the Goths, being uncertain what\r\nnext to do, went in quest of Frigeridus, with the resolution to destroy\r\nhim wherever they could find him, as a formidable obstacle to their\r\nsuccess; and having rested for a while to refresh themselves with sleep\r\nand better food than usual, they then pursued him like so many wild\r\nbeasts, having learnt that by Gratian's order he had returned into\r\nThrace, and had pitched his camp near Beræa, intending to wait there to\r\nsee how affairs would turn out.\r\n\r\n2. They hastened accordingly, that by a rapid march they might carry\r\nout their proposed plan; but Frigeridus, who knew as well how to command\r\nas to preserve his troops, either suspected their plans, or else\r\nobtained accurate information respecting them from the scouts whom he\r\nhad sent out; and therefore returned over the mountains and through the\r\nthick forests into Illyricum; being full of joy at the success which an\r\nunexpected chance threw in his way.\r\n\r\n3. For as he was retreating, and moving on steadily with his force in a\r\nsolid column, he came upon Farnobius, one of the chieftains of the\r\nGoths, who was roaming about at random with a large predatory band, and\r\na body of the Taifali, with whom he had lately made an alliance, and who\r\n(if it is worth mentioning), when our soldiers were all dispersed for\r\nfear of the strange nations which were threatening them, had taken\r\nadvantage of their dispersion to cross the river, in order to plunder\r\nthe country thus left without defenders.\r\n\r\n4. When their troops thus suddenly came in sight, our general with great\r\nprudence prepared to bring on a battle at close quarters, and, in spite\r\nof their ferocious threats, at once attacked the combined leaders of the\r\ntwo nations; and would have slain them all, not leaving a single one of\r\nthem to convey news of their disaster, if, after Farnobius, hitherto the\r\nmuch-dreaded cause of all these troubles, had been slain, with a great\r\nnumber of his men, he had not voluntarily spared the rest on their own\r\nearnest supplication; and then he distributed those to whom he had thus\r\ngranted their lives in the districts around the Italian towns of Modena,\r\nReggio, and Parma, which he allotted to them to cultivate.\r\n\r\n5. It is said that this nation of the Taifali was so profligate, and so\r\nimmersed in the foulest obscenities of life, that they indulged in all\r\nkinds of unnatural lusts, exhausting the vigour both of youth and\r\nmanhood in the most polluted defilements of debauchery. But if any adult\r\ncaught a boar or slew a bear single-handed, he was then exempted from\r\nall compulsion of submitting to such ignominious pollution.\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\n§ 1. It was when autumn was passing into winter that terrible whirlwinds\r\nswept over Thrace; and as if the Furies were throwing everything into\r\nconfusion, awful storms extended even into distant regions.\r\n\r\n2. And now the people of the Allemanni, belonging to the district of\r\nLintz, who border on the Tyrol, having by treacherous incursions\r\nviolated the treaty which had been made with them some time before,\r\nbegan to make attempts upon our frontier; and this calamity had the\r\nfollowing lamentable beginning.\r\n\r\n3. One of this nation who was serving among the guards of the emperor,\r\nreturned home at the call of some private business of his own; and being\r\na very talkative person, when he was continually asked what was doing in\r\nthe palace, he told them that Valens, his uncle, had sent for Gratian to\r\nconduct the campaign in the East, in order that by their combined forces\r\nthey might drive back the inhabitants of the countries on our eastern\r\nfrontier, who had all conspired for the overthrow of the Roman state.\r\n\r\n4. The people of Lintz greedily swallowed this intelligence, looking on\r\nit as if it concerned themselves also as neighbours, being so rapid and\r\nactive in their movements; and so they assembled, in predatory bands,\r\nand when the Rhine was sufficiently frozen over to be passable, in the\r\nmonth of February.... The Celtæ, with the Petulantes legion, repulsed\r\nthem, but not without considerable loss.\r\n\r\n5. These Germans, though thus compelled to retreat, being aware that the\r\ngreater part of our army had been despatched into Illyricum, where the\r\nemperor was about to follow to assume the command, became more bold than\r\never, and conceived the idea of greater enterprises. Having collected\r\nthe inhabitants of all the adjacent countries into one body, and with\r\n40,000 armed men, or 70,000, as some, who seek to enhance the renown of\r\nthe emperor, have boasted, they with great arrogance and confidence\r\nburst into our territories.\r\n\r\n6. Gratian, when he heard of this event, was greatly alarmed, and\r\nrecalling the cohorts which he had sent on before into Pannonia, and\r\ncollecting others whom he had prudently retained in Gaul, he committed\r\nthe affair to the conduct of Nannienus, a leader of great prudence and\r\nskill, joining with him as his colleague with equal power, Mellobaudes,\r\nthe count-commander of the domestics and king of the Franks, a man of\r\ngreat courage and renown in war.[195]\r\n\r\n7. Nannienus took into his consideration the variable chances of\r\nfortune, and therefore voted for acting slowly and with caution, while\r\nMellobaudes, hurried away by a fierce desire for fighting, according to\r\nhis usual custom, was eager at once to march against the enemy; and\r\nwould not brook delay.\r\n\r\n8. Presently a horrid shout was raised by the enemy, and the trumpeters\r\non our side also gave the signal for battle, upon which a fierce\r\nengagement began near Colmar. On both sides numbers fell beneath the\r\nblows of arrows and hurled javelins.\r\n\r\n9. But while the battle was raging, the multitude of the enemy appeared\r\nso countless, that our soldiers, avoiding a conflict with them on the\r\nopen field, dispersed as best they could among the different narrow\r\npaths overgrown with trees; but they afterwards stood their ground\r\nfirmly, and by the boldness of their carriage and the dazzling splendour\r\nof their arms, when seen from a distance, made the barbarians fear that\r\nthe emperor himself was at hand.\r\n\r\n10. And they suddenly turned their backs, still offering occasional\r\nresistance, to leave no chance for safety untried; but at last they were\r\nrouted with such slaughter that of their whole number not above 9,000,\r\nas was reckoned, escaped, and these owed their safety to the thickness\r\nof the woods. Among the many bold and gallant men who perished was their\r\nking, Priarius, who had been the principal cause of this ruinous war.\r\n\r\n11. Gratian was greatly delighted and encouraged by this success; and\r\nintending now to proceed to the East, he secretly crossed the Rhine, and\r\nturned his march to the left, being full of sanguine hopes, and\r\nresolving, if fortune should only favour his enterprise, to destroy the\r\nwhole of this treacherous and turbulent nation.\r\n\r\n12. And as intelligence of this design was conveyed to the people of\r\nLintz by repeated messengers, they, who had already been reduced to\r\ngreat weakness by the almost entire destruction of their forces, and\r\nwere now greatly alarmed at the expected approach of the emperor,\r\nhesitated what to do, and as neither by resistance, nor by anything\r\nwhich they could do or devise, did they perceive any possibility of\r\nobtaining ever so brief a respite, they withdrew with speed to their\r\nhills, which were almost inaccessible from the steepness of their\r\nprecipices, and reaching the most inaccessible rocks by a winding path,\r\nthey conveyed thither their riches and their families, and prepared to\r\ndefend them with all their might.\r\n\r\n13. Having deliberated on this difficulty, our general selected 500 men\r\nof proved experience in war out of each legion, to station opposite to\r\nthe entrances to this wall of rock. And they, being further encouraged\r\nby the fact that the emperor himself was continually seen actively\r\nemployed among the front rank, endeavoured to scale the precipices, not\r\ndoubting but that if they could once set foot upon the rocks they should\r\ninstantly catch the barbarians, like so much game, without any conflict;\r\nand so an engagement was commenced towards the approach of noon, and\r\nlasted even to the darkness of night.\r\n\r\n14. Both sides experienced heavy losses. Our men slew numbers, and fell\r\nin numbers; and the armour of the emperor's body-guard, glittering with\r\ngold and brilliant colours, was crushed beneath the weight of the heavy\r\nmissiles hurled upon them.\r\n\r\n15. Gratian held a long deliberation with his chief officers; and it\r\nseemed to them fruitless and mischievous to contend with unreasonable\r\nobstinacy against these rugged and overhanging rocks; at last (as is\r\nusual in such affairs), after various opinions had been delivered, it\r\nwas determined, without making any more active efforts, to blockade the\r\nbarbarians and reduce them by famine; since against all active\r\nenterprises the character of the ground which they occupied was a\r\nsufficient defence.\r\n\r\n16. But the Germans still held out with unflinching obstinacy, and being\r\nthoroughly acquainted with the country, retreated to other mountains\r\nstill more lofty than those which they occupied at first. Thither also\r\nthe emperor turned with his army, with the same energy as before,\r\nseeking for a path which might lead him to the heights.\r\n\r\n17. And when the barbarians saw him thus with unwearied perseverance\r\nintent upon their destruction, they surrendered; and having by humble\r\nsupplication obtained mercy, they furnished a reinforcement of the\r\nflower of their youth to be mingled with our recruits, and were\r\npermitted to retire in safety to their native land.\r\n\r\n18. It is beyond all belief how much vigour and rapidity of action\r\nGratian, by the favour of the eternal Deity, displayed in gaining this\r\nseasonable and beneficial victory, which broke the power of the Western\r\ntribes at a time when he was preparing to hasten in another direction.\r\nHe was indeed a young prince of admirable disposition, eloquent,\r\nmoderate, warlike, and merciful, rivalling the most admirable of his\r\npredecessors, even while the down of youth was still upon his cheeks;\r\nthe only drawback to his character being that he was sometimes drawn\r\ninto ridiculous actions, when, in consequence of temptations held out by\r\nhis minions and favourites, he imitated the vain pursuits of Cæsar\r\nCommodus; but he was never bloodthirsty.\r\n\r\n19. For as that prince, because he had been accustomed to slay numbers\r\nof wild beasts with his javelins in the sight of the people, and prided\r\nhimself beyond measure on the skill with which he slew a hundred lions\r\nlet loose at the same time in the amphitheatre with different missiles,\r\nand without ever having to repeat his shot; so Gratian, in the\r\nenclosures called preserves, slew wild beasts with his arrows,\r\nneglecting much serious business for this amusement, and this at a time\r\nwhen if Marcus Antoninus had resumed the empire he would have found it\r\nhard, without colleagues of equal genius to his own, and without the\r\nmost serious deliberation of counsel, to remedy the grievous disasters\r\nof the republic.\r\n\r\n20. Therefore having made all the arrangements which the time would\r\npermit for the affairs of Gaul, and having punished the traitor of the\r\nScutarii who had betrayed to the barbarians the intelligence that the\r\nemperor was about to depart with all speed for Illyricum, Gratianus\r\nquitted the army, and passing through the fortress known as that of\r\nArbor Felix, he proceeded by forced marches to carry his assistance to\r\nthose who needed it.\r\n\r\n21. About this time, while Frigeridus was with great wisdom devising\r\nmany schemes likely to prove of advantage to the general safety, and was\r\npreparing to fortify the defiles of the Succi, to prevent the enemy\r\n(who, by the rapidity of their movements and their fondness for sallies,\r\nwere always threatening the northern provinces like a torrent) from\r\nextending their inroads any further he was superseded by a count named\r\nMaurus, a man cruel, ferocious, fickle, and untrustworthy. This man, as\r\nwe have related in our account of preceding transactions being one of\r\nJulian's body-guard to whom the defence of the palace was expressly\r\ncommitted, while that prince was doubting about accepting the imperial\r\nauthority, took the chain from his own neck and offered it to him for a\r\ndiadem.\r\n\r\n22. Thus, in the most critical aspect of our difficulties, a cautious\r\nand energetic general was removed, when, even if he had previously\r\nretired into private life, he ought, from the greatness of the affairs\r\nwhich required his superintendence, to have been brought back again to\r\nthe camp.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\nA.D. 378.\r\n\r\n§ 1. About the same time Valens quitted Antioch, and, after a long\r\njourney, came to Constantinople, where he stayed a few days, being made\r\nanxious by a trifling sedition among the citizens. He intrusted the\r\ncommand of the infantry, which had previously been committed to Trajan,\r\nto Sebastian, who at his request had been lately sent to him from Italy,\r\nbeing a general of well-known vigilance; and he himself went to\r\nMelanthias, a country palace belonging to the emperors, where he\r\nconciliated the soldiers by giving them their pay, furnishing them with\r\nprovisions, and frequently addressing them in courteous speeches.\r\n\r\n2. Having left this place, he proceeded according to the stages he had\r\nmarked out, and came to a station named Nice, where he learnt from\r\nintelligence brought by his scouts, that the barbarians, who had\r\ncollected a rich booty, were returning loaded with it from the districts\r\nabout Mount Rhodope, and were now near Hadrianople. They, hearing of\r\nthe approach of the emperor with a numerous force, were hastening to\r\njoin their countrymen, who were in strong positions around Beræa and\r\nNicopolis; and immediately (as the ripeness of the opportunity thus\r\nthrown in his way required) the emperor ordered Sebastian to hasten on\r\nwith three hundred picked soldiers of each legion, to do something (as\r\nhe promised) of signal advantage to the commonweal.\r\n\r\n3. Sebastian pushed on by forced marches, and came in sight of the enemy\r\nnear Hadrianople; but as the gates were barred against him, he was\r\nunable to approach nearer, since the garrison feared that he had been\r\ntaken prisoner by the enemy, and won over by them: so that something to\r\nthe injury of the city might happen, like what had formerly taken place\r\nin the case of Count Actus, who had been cunningly taken prisoner by the\r\nsoldiers of Magnentius, and who thus caused the opening of the passes of\r\nthe Julian Alps.\r\n\r\n4. At last, though late, they recognized Sebastian, and allowed him to\r\nenter the city. He, then, as well as he could, refreshed the troops\r\nunder his command with food and rest, and next morning secretly issued\r\nforth, and towards evening, being partially concealed by the rising\r\nground and some trees, he suddenly caught sight of the predatory bands\r\nof the Goths near the river Maritza, where, favoured by the darkness of\r\nnight, he charged them while in disorder and unprepared, routing them so\r\ncompletely that, with the exception of a few whom swiftness of foot\r\nsaved from death, the whole body were slain, and he recovered such an\r\nenormous quantity of booty, that neither the city, nor the extensive\r\nplains around could contain it.\r\n\r\n5. Fritigern was greatly alarmed; and fearing lest this general, who as\r\nwe have often heard succeeded in all his undertakings, should surprise\r\nand utterly destroy his different detachments, which were scattered at\r\nrandom over the country, intent only on plunder, he called in all his\r\nmen near the town of Cabyle, and at once made off, in order to gain the\r\nopen country, where he would not be liable to be straitened for want of\r\nprovisions, or harassed by secret ambuscades.\r\n\r\n6. While these events were proceeding in Thrace, Gratian having sent\r\nletters to inform his uncle of the energy with which he had overcome the\r\nAllemanni, and forwarded his baggage by land, himself, with a picked\r\nband of his quickest troops, crossed the Danube, reached Bononia, and\r\nafterwards Sirmium, where he halted four days. He then descended the\r\nriver to the Camp of Mars, where he was laid up by an intermittent\r\nfever, and, being suddenly assailed by the Alani, lost a few of his\r\nfollowers.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. At this time Valens was disturbed by a twofold anxiety, having\r\nlearned that the people of Lintz had been defeated, and also because\r\nSebastian, in the letters which he sent from time to time, exaggerated\r\nwhat had taken place by his pompous language. Therefore he advanced from\r\nMelanthias, being eager by some glorious exploit to equal his youthful\r\nnephew, by whose virtue he was greatly excited. He was at the head of a\r\nnumerous force, neither unwarlike nor contemptible, and had united with\r\nthem many veteran bands, among whom were several officers of high rank,\r\nespecially Trajan, who a little while before had been commander of the\r\nforces.\r\n\r\n2. And as by means of spies and observation it was ascertained that the\r\nenemy were intending to blockade the different roads by which the\r\nnecessary supplies must come, with strong divisions, he sent a\r\nsufficient force to prevent this, despatching a body of the archers of\r\nthe infantry and a squadron of cavalry, with all speed, to occupy the\r\nnarrow passes in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n3. Three days afterwards, when the barbarians, who were advancing\r\nslowly, because they feared an attack in the unfavourable ground which\r\nthey were traversing, arrived within fifteen miles from the station of\r\nNice, which was the aim of their march, the emperor, with wanton\r\nimpetuosity, resolved on attacking them instantly, because those who had\r\nbeen sent forward to reconnoitre (what led to such a mistake is unknown)\r\naffirmed that their entire body did not exceed ten thousand men.\r\n\r\n4. Marching on with his army in battle array, he came near the suburb\r\nof Hadrianople, where he pitched his camp, strengthening it with a\r\nrampart of palisades, and then impatiently waited for Gratian. While\r\nhere, Richomeres, Count of the Domestici, arrived, who had been sent on\r\nby that emperor with letters announcing his immediate approach.\r\n\r\n5. And imploring Valens to wait a little while for him that he might\r\nshare his danger, and not rashly face the danger before him single\r\nhanded, he took counsel with his officers as to what was best to be\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n6. Some, following the advice of Sebastian, recommended with urgency\r\nthat he should at once go forth to battle; while Victor, master-general\r\nof the cavalry, a Sarmatian by birth, but a man of slow and cautious\r\ntemper, recommended him to wait for his imperial colleague, and this\r\nadvice was supported by several other officers, who suggested that the\r\nreinforcement of the Gallic army would be likely to awe the fiery\r\narrogance of the barbarians.\r\n\r\n7. However, the fatal obstinacy of the emperor prevailed, fortified by\r\nthe flattery of some of the princes, who advised him to hasten with all\r\nspeed, so that Gratian might have no share in a victory which, as they\r\nfancied, was already almost gained.\r\n\r\n8. And while all necessary preparations were being made for the battle,\r\na presbyter of the Christian religion (as he called himself), having\r\nbeen sent by Fritigern as his ambassador, came, with some colleagues of\r\nlow rank, to the emperor's camp; and having been received with courtesy,\r\nhe presented a letter from that chieftain, openly requesting that the\r\nemperor would grant to him and to his followers, who were now exiles\r\nfrom their native homes, from which they had been driven by the rapid\r\ninvasions of savage nations, Thrace, with all its flocks and all its\r\ncrops, for a habitation. And if Valens would consent to this, Fritigern\r\nwould agree to a perpetual peace.\r\n\r\n9. In addition to this message, the same Christian, as one acquainted\r\nwith his commander's secrets, and well trusted, produced other secret\r\nletters from his chieftain who, being full of craft and every resource\r\nof deceit, informed Valens, as one who was hereafter to be his friend\r\nand ally, that he had no other means to appease the ferocity of his\r\ncountrymen, or to induce them to accept conditions advantageous to the\r\nRoman state, unless from time to time he showed them an army under arms\r\nclose at hand, and by frightening them with the name of the emperor,\r\nrecalled them from their mischievous eagerness for fighting. The\r\nambassadors retired unsuccessful, having been looked on as suspicious\r\ncharacters by the emperor.\r\n\r\n10. When the day broke which the annals mark as the fifth of the Ides of\r\nAugust, the Roman standards were advanced with haste, the baggage having\r\nbeen placed close to the walls of Hadrianople, under a sufficient guard\r\nof soldiers of the legions; the treasures and the chief insignia of the\r\nemperor's rank were within the walls, with the prefect and the principal\r\nmembers of the council.\r\n\r\n11. Then, having traversed the broken ground which divided the two\r\narmies, as the burning day was progressing towards noon, at last, after\r\nmarching eight miles, our men came in sight of the waggons of the enemy,\r\nwhich had been stated by the scouts to be all arranged in a circle.\r\nAccording to their custom, the barbarian host raised a fierce and\r\nhideous yell, while the Roman generals marshalled their line of battle.\r\nThe right wing of the cavalry was placed in front; the chief portion of\r\nthe infantry was kept in reserve.\r\n\r\n12. But the left wing of the cavalry, of which a considerable number\r\nwere still straggling on the road, were advancing with speed, though\r\nwith great difficulty; and while this wing was deploying, not as yet\r\nmeeting with any obstacle, the barbarians being alarmed at the terrible\r\nclang of their arms and the threatening crash of their shields (since a\r\nlarge portion of their own army was still at a distance, under Alatheus\r\nand Saphrax, and, though sent for, had not yet arrived), again sent\r\nambassadors to ask for peace.\r\n\r\n13. The emperor was offended at the lowness of their rank, and replied,\r\nthat if they wished to make a lasting treaty, they must send him nobles\r\nof sufficient dignity. They designedly delayed, in order by the\r\nfallacious truce which subsisted during the negotiation to give time for\r\ntheir cavalry to return, whom they looked upon as close at hand; and for\r\nour soldiers, already suffering from the summer heat, to become parched\r\nand exhausted by the conflagration of the vast plain; as the enemy had,\r\nwith this object, set fire to the crops by means of burning faggots and\r\nfuel. To this evil another was added, that both men and cattle were\r\nsuffering from extreme hunger.\r\n\r\n14. In the meantime Fritigern, being skilful in divining the future, and\r\nfearing a doubtful struggle, of his own head sent one of his men as a\r\nherald, requesting that some nobles and picked men should at once be\r\nsent to him as hostages for his safety, when he himself would fearlessly\r\nbring us both military aid and supplies.\r\n\r\n15. The proposition of this formidable chief was received with praise\r\nand approbation, and the tribune Equitius, a relation of Valens, who was\r\nat that time high steward of the palace, was appointed, with general\r\nconsent, to go with all speed to the barbarians as a hostage. But he\r\nrefused, because he had once been taken prisoner by the enemy, and had\r\nescaped from Dibaltum, so that he feared their vengeful anger; upon this\r\nRichomeres voluntarily offered himself, and willingly undertook to go,\r\nthinking it a bold action, and one becoming a brave man; and so he set\r\nout, bearing vouchers of his rank and high birth.\r\n\r\n16. And as he was on his way towards the enemy's camp, the accompanying\r\narchers and Scutarii, who on that occasion were under the command of\r\nBacurius, a native of Iberia, and of Cassio, yielded, while on their\r\nmarch, to an indiscreet impetuosity, and on approaching the enemy, first\r\nattacked them rashly, and then by a cowardly flight disgraced the\r\nbeginning of the campaign.\r\n\r\n17. This ill-timed attack frustrated the willing services of Richomeres,\r\nas he was not permitted to proceed; in the mean time the cavalry of the\r\nGoths had returned with Alatheus and Saphrax, and with them a battalion\r\nof Alani; these descending from the mountains like a thunderbolt, spread\r\nconfusion and slaughter among all whom in their rapid charge they came\r\nacross.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.\r\n\r\n§ 1. And while arms and missiles of all kinds were meeting in fierce\r\nconflict, and Bellona, blowing her mournful trumpet, was raging more\r\nfiercely than usual, to inflict disaster on the Romans, our men began to\r\nretreat; but presently, roused by the reproaches of their officers, they\r\nmade a fresh stand, and the battle increased like a conflagration,\r\nterrifying our soldiers, numbers of whom were pierced by strokes from\r\nthe javelins hurled at them, and from arrows.\r\n\r\n2. Then the two lines of battle dashed against each other, like the\r\nbeaks (or rams) of ships, and thrusting with all their might, were\r\ntossed to and fro, like the waves of the sea. Our left wing had advanced\r\nactually up to the waggons, with the intent to push on still further if\r\nthey were properly supported; but they were deserted by the rest of the\r\ncavalry, and so pressed upon by the superior numbers of the enemy, that\r\nthey were overwhelmed and beaten down, like the ruin of a vast rampart.\r\nPresently our infantry also was left unsupported, while the different\r\ncompanies became so huddled together that a soldier could hardly draw\r\nhis sword, or withdraw his hand after he had once stretched it out. And\r\nby this time such clouds of dust arose that it was scarcely possible to\r\nsee the sky, which resounded with horrible cries; and in consequence,\r\nthe darts, which were bearing death on every side, reached their mark,\r\nand fell with deadly effect, because no one could see them beforehand so\r\nas to guard against them.\r\n\r\n3. But when the barbarians, rushing on with their enormous host, beat\r\ndown our horses and men, and left no spot to which our ranks could fall\r\nback to deploy, while they were so closely packed that it was impossible\r\nto escape by forcing a way through them, our men at last began to\r\ndespise death, and again took to their swords and slew all they\r\nencountered, while with mutual blows of battle-axes, helmets and\r\nbreastplates were dashed in pieces.\r\n\r\n4. Then you might see the barbarian towering in his fierceness, hissing\r\nor shouting, fall with his legs pierced through, or his right hand cut\r\noff, sword and all, or his side transfixed, and still, in the last gasp\r\nof life, casting round him defiant glances. The plain was covered with\r\ncarcases, strewing the mutual ruin of the combatants; while the groans\r\nof the dying, or of men fearfully wounded, were intense, and caused\r\ngreat dismay all around.\r\n\r\n5. Amidst all this great tumult and confusion, our infantry were\r\nexhausted by toil and danger, till at last they had neither strength\r\nleft to fight, nor spirits to plan anything; their spears were broken by\r\nthe frequent collisions, so that they were forced to content themselves\r\nwith their drawn swords, which they thrust into the dense battalions of\r\nthe enemy, disregarding their own safety, and seeing that every\r\npossibility of escape was cut off from them.\r\n\r\n6. The ground, covered with streams of blood, made their feet slip, so\r\nthat all that they endeavoured to do was to sell their lives as dearly\r\nas possible; and with such vehemence did they resist their enemies who\r\npressed on them, that some were even killed by their own weapons. At\r\nlast one black pool of blood disfigured everything, and wherever the eye\r\nturned, it could see nothing but piled-up heaps of dead, and lifeless\r\ncorpses trampled on without mercy.\r\n\r\n7. The sun being now high in the heavens, having traversed the sign of\r\nLeo, and reached the abode of the heavenly Virgo, scorched the Romans,\r\nwho were emaciated by hunger, worn out with toil, and scarcely able to\r\nsupport even the weight of their armour. At last our columns were\r\nentirely beaten back by the overpowering weight of the barbarians, and\r\nso they took to disorderly flight, which is the only resource in\r\nextremity, each man trying to save himself as well as he could.\r\n\r\n8. While they were all flying and scattering themselves over roads with\r\nwhich they were unacquainted, the emperor, bewildered with terrible\r\nfear, made his way over heaps of dead, and fled to the battalions of the\r\nLancearii and the Mattiarii, who, till the superior numbers of the enemy\r\nbecame wholly irresistible, stood firm and immovable. As soon as he saw\r\nhim. Trajan exclaimed that all hope was lost, unless the emperor, thus\r\ndeserted by his guards, could be protected by the aid of his foreign\r\nallies.\r\n\r\n9. When this exclamation was heard, a count named Victor hastened to\r\nbring up with all speed the Batavians, who were placed in the reserve,\r\nand who ought to have been near at hand, to the emperor's assistance;\r\nbut as none of them could be found, he too retreated, and in a similar\r\nmanner Richomeres and Saturninus saved themselves from danger.\r\n\r\n10. So now, with rage flashing in their eyes, the barbarians pursued our\r\nmen, who were in a state of torpor, the warmth of their veins having\r\ndeserted them. Many were slain without knowing who smote them; some were\r\noverwhelmed by the mere weight of the crowd which pressed upon them; and\r\nsome were slain by wounds inflicted by their own comrades. The\r\nbarbarians spared neither those who yielded nor those who resisted.\r\n\r\n11. Besides these, many half slain lay blocking up the roads, unable to\r\nendure the torture of their wounds; and heaps of dead horses were piled\r\nup and filled the plain with their carcases. At last a dark moonless\r\nnight put an end to the irremediable disaster which cost the Roman state\r\nso dear.\r\n\r\n12. Just when it first became dark, the emperor being among a crowd of\r\ncommon soldiers, as it was believed--for no one said either that he had\r\nseen him, or been near him--was mortally wounded with an arrow, and,\r\nvery shortly after, died, though his body was never found. For as some\r\nof the enemy loitered for a long time about the field in order to\r\nplunder the dead, none of the defeated army or of the inhabitants\r\nventured to go to them.\r\n\r\n13. A similar fate befell the Cæsar Decius, when fighting vigorously\r\nagainst the barbarians; for he was thrown by his horse falling, which he\r\nhad been unable to hold, and was plunged into a swamp, out of which he\r\ncould never emerge, nor could his body be found.\r\n\r\n14. Others report that Valens did not die immediately, but that he was\r\nborne by a small body of picked soldiers and eunuchs to a cabin in the\r\nneighbourhood, which was strongly built, with two stories; and that\r\nwhile these unskilful hands were tending his wounds, the cottage was\r\nsurrounded by the enemy, though they did not know who was in it; still,\r\nhowever, he was saved from the disgrace of being made a prisoner.\r\n\r\n15. For when his pursuers, while vainly attempting to force the barred\r\ndoors, were assailed with arrows from the roof, they, not to lose by so\r\ninconvenient a delay the opportunity of collecting plunder, gathered\r\nsome faggots and stubble, and setting fire to them, burnt down the\r\nbuilding, with those who were in it.\r\n\r\n16. But one of the soldiers dropped from the windows, and, being taken\r\nprisoner by the barbarians, revealed to them what had taken place, which\r\ncaused them great concern, because they looked upon themselves as\r\ndefrauded of great glory in not having taken the ruler of the Roman\r\nstate alive. This same young man afterwards secretly returned to our\r\npeople, and gave this account of the affair.\r\n\r\n17. When Spain had been recovered after a similar disaster, we are told\r\nthat one of the Scipios was lost in a fire, the tower in which he had\r\ntaken refuge having been burnt. At all events it is certain that neither\r\nScipio nor Valens enjoyed that last honour of the dead--a regular\r\nfuneral.\r\n\r\n18. Many illustrious men fell in this disastrous defeat, and among them\r\none of the most remarkable was Trajan, and another was Sebastian; there\r\nperished also thirty-five tribunes who had no particular command, many\r\ncaptains of battalions, and Valerianus and Equitius, one of whom was\r\nmaster of the horse and the other high steward. Potentius, too, tribune\r\nof the promoted officers, fell in the flower of his age, a man respected\r\nby all persons of virtue, and recommended by the merits of his father,\r\nUrsicinus, who had formerly been commander of the forces, as well as by\r\nhis own. Scarcely one-third of the whole army escaped.\r\n\r\n19. Nor, except the battle of Cannæ, is so destructive a slaughter\r\nrecorded in our annals; though, even in the times of their prosperity,\r\nthe Romans have more than once had to deplore the uncertainty of war,\r\nand have for a time succumbed to evil Fortune; while the well-known\r\ndirges of the Greeks have bewailed many disastrous battles.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\n§ 1. Such was the death of Valens, when he was about fifty years old,\r\nand had reigned rather less than fourteen years. We will now describe\r\nhis virtues, which were known to many, and his vices.\r\n\r\n2. He was a faithful and steady friend--a severe chastiser of\r\nambition--a rigid upholder of both military and civil discipline--always\r\ncareful that no one should assume importance on account of any\r\nrelationship to himself; slow both in conferring office, and in taking\r\nit away; a very just ruler of the provinces, all of which he protected\r\nfrom injury, as if each had been his own house; devoting singular care\r\nto the lessening the burdens of the state, and never permitting any\r\nincrease of taxation. He was very moderate in the exaction of debts due\r\nto the state, but a vehement and implacable foe to all thieves, and to\r\nevery one convicted of peculations; nor in affairs of this kind was the\r\nEast, by its own confession, ever better treated under any other\r\nemperor.\r\n\r\n3. Besides all this, he was liberal with due regard to moderation, of\r\nwhich quality there are many examples, one of which it will be\r\nsufficient to mention here:--As in palaces there are always some persons\r\ncovetous of the possessions of others, if any one petitioned for lapsed\r\nproperty, or anything else which it was usual to apply for, he made a\r\nproper distinction between just and unjust claims, and when he gave it\r\nto the petitioner, while reserving full liberty to any one to raise\r\nobjections, he often associated the successful candidate with three or\r\nfour partners, in order that those covetous suitors might conduct\r\nthemselves with more moderation, when they saw the profits for which\r\nthey were so eager diminished by this device.\r\n\r\n4. Of the edifices, which in the different cities and towns he either\r\nrepaired or built from their foundations, I will say nothing (to avoid\r\nprolixity), allowing those things to speak for themselves. These\r\nqualities, in my opinion, deserve the imitation of all good men. Now let\r\nus enumerate his vices.\r\n\r\n5. He was an immoderate coveter of great wealth; impatient of labour, he\r\naffected an extreme severity, and was too much inclined to cruelty; his\r\nbehaviour was rude and rough; and he was little imbued with skill either\r\nin war or in the liberal arts. He willingly sought profit and advantage\r\nin the miseries of others, and was more than ever intolerable in\r\nstraining ordinary offences into sedition or treason; he cruelly\r\nencompassed the death or ruin of wealthy nobles.\r\n\r\n6. This also was unendurable, that while he wished to have it appear\r\nthat all actions and suits were decided according to the law, and while\r\nthe investigation of such affairs was delegated to judges especially\r\nselected as the most proper to decide them, he still would not allow any\r\ndecision to be given which was contrary to his own pleasure. He was also\r\ninsulting, passionate, and always willing to listen to all informers,\r\nwithout the least distinction as to whether the charges which they\r\nadvanced were true or false. And this vice is one very much to be\r\ndreaded, even in private affairs of everyday occurrence.\r\n\r\n7. He was dilatory and sluggish; of a swarthy complexion; had a cast in\r\none eye, a blemish, however, which was not visible at a distance; his\r\nlimbs were well set; his figure was neither tall nor short; he was\r\nknock-kneed, and rather pot-bellied.\r\n\r\n8. This is enough to say about Valens: and the recollection of his\r\ncontemporaries will fully testify that this account is a true one. But\r\nwe must not omit to mention that when he had learnt that the oracle of\r\nthe tripod, which we have related to have been moved by Patricius and\r\nHilanus, contained those three prophetic lines, the last of which is,--\r\n\r\n  +\"En pedioisi Mimantos alalkomenoisin arêa.\"+\r\n\r\n  \"Repelling murd'rous war in Mimas' plain;\"\r\n\r\n--he, being void of accomplishments and illiterate, despised them at\r\nfirst; but as his calamities increased, he became filled with abject\r\nfear, and, from a recollection of this same prophecy, began to dread the\r\nvery name of Asia, where he had been informed by learned men that both\r\nHomer and Cicero had spoken of the Mountain of Mimas over the town of\r\nErythræ.\r\n\r\n9. Lastly,--after his death, and the departure of the enemy, it is said\r\nthat a monument was found near the spot where he is believed to have\r\ndied, with a stone fixed into it inscribed with Greek characters,\r\nindicating that some ancient noble of the name of Mimas was buried\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\r\nXV.\r\n\r\n§ 1. After this disastrous battle, when night had veiled the earth in\r\ndarkness, those who survived fled, some to the right, some to the left,\r\nor wherever fear guided them, each man seeking refuge among his\r\nrelations, as no one could think of anything but himself, while all\r\nfancied the lances of the enemy sticking in their backs. And far off\r\nwere heard the miserable wailings of those who were left behind--the\r\nsobs of the dying, and the agonizing groans of the wounded.\r\n\r\n2. But when daylight returned, the conquerors, like wild beasts rendered\r\nstill more savage by the blood they had tasted, and allured by the\r\ntemptations of groundless hope, marched in a dense column upon\r\nHadrianople, resolved to run any risk in order to take it, having been\r\ninformed by traitors and deserters that the principal officers of State,\r\nthe insignia of the imperial authority, and the treasures of Valens had\r\nall been placed there for safety, as in an impregnable fortress.\r\n\r\n3. And to prevent the ardour of the soldiers from being cooled by delay,\r\nthe whole city was blockaded by the fourth hour; and the siege from that\r\ntime was carried on with great vigour, the besiegers, from their innate\r\nferocity, pressing in to complete its destruction, while, on the other\r\nhand, the garrison was stimulated to great exertions by their natural\r\ncourage.\r\n\r\n4. And while the vast number of soldiers and grooms, who were prohibited\r\nfrom entering the city with their beasts, kept close to the walls and to\r\nthe houses which joined them, and fought gallantly, considering the\r\ndisadvantages under which they laboured from the lowness of the ground\r\nwhich they occupied, and baffled the rage of their assailants till the\r\nninth hour of the day, on a sudden three hundred of our infantry, of\r\nthose who were nearest the battlements, formed themselves into a solid\r\nbody, and deserted to the barbarians, who seized upon them with avidity,\r\nand (it is not known on what account) at once slaughtered them all. And\r\nfrom that time forth it was remarked that no one, even in the extremity\r\nof despair, adopted any similar conduct.\r\n\r\n5. Now while all these misfortunes were at their height, suddenly there\r\ncame a violent thunderstorm, and rain pouring down from the black clouds\r\ndispersed the bands of soldiers who were raging around; and they\r\nreturned to their camp, which was measured out in a circle by their\r\nwaggons; and being more elated and haughty than ever, they sent\r\nthreatening letters to our men ... and an ambassador ... on condition of\r\nsafety to him.\r\n\r\n6. But as the messenger did not dare to enter the city, the letters were\r\nat last brought in by a certain Christian; and when they had been read\r\nand considered with all proper attention, the rest of the day and the\r\nwhole of the night was devoted to preparing for defence. For inside the\r\ncity the gates were blocked up with huge stones; the weak parts of the\r\nwalls were strengthened, and engines to hurl javelins or stones were\r\nfixed on all convenient places, and a sufficient supply of water was\r\nalso provided; for the day before some of the combatants had been\r\ndistressed almost to death by thirst.\r\n\r\n7. On the other hand the Goths, considering the difficulty and\r\nuncertainty of all warlike transactions, and becoming anxious at seeing\r\ntheir bravest warriors wounded and slain, and their strength gradually\r\ndiminished, devised and adopted a crafty counsel, which, however, was\r\nrevealed to us by Justice herself.\r\n\r\n8. They seduced some picked soldiers of our army, who had revolted to\r\nthem the day before, to pretend to escape back to their former comrades,\r\nand thus gain admittance within the walls; and after they had effected\r\ntheir entrance, they were secretly to set fire to some part of the city,\r\nso that the conflagration might serve as a secret signal, and while the\r\ngarrison and citizens were occupied in extinguishing it, the walls might\r\nbe left undefended, and so be easily stormed.\r\n\r\n9. The traitors did as they were commanded; and when they came near the\r\nditch they stretched out their hands, and with entreaties requested to\r\nbe admitted into the city as Romans. When they were admitted, however\r\n(since no suspicion existed to hinder their admission), and were\r\nquestioned as to the plans of the enemy, they varied in their tale: and\r\nin consequence they were put to the torture, and having formally\r\nconfessed what they had undertaken to do, they were all beheaded.\r\n\r\n10. Accordingly, every resource of war having been prepared, the\r\nbarbarians, at the third watch discarding all fear from past failures,\r\nrushed in enormous numbers against the blocked-up entrances of the city,\r\ntheir officers urging them with great obstinacy. But the provincials and\r\nimperial guards, with the rest of the garrison, rose with fearless\r\ncourage to repel them, and their missiles of every kind, even when shot\r\nat random among so vast a crowd, could not fall harmless. Our men\r\nperceived that the barbarians were using the same weapons which we\r\nourselves had shot at them: and accordingly an order was given that the\r\nstrings which fastened the iron points to the javelins and arrows should\r\nbe cut before they were hurled or shot; so that while flying they should\r\npreserve their efficacy, but when they pierced a body or fell on the\r\nground they should come asunder.\r\n\r\n11. While affairs were in this critical state an unexpected accident had\r\na considerable influence on the result. A scorpion, a military engine\r\nwhich in ordinary language is also known as the wild-ass, being\r\nstationed opposite the dense array of the enemy, hurled forth a huge\r\nstone, which, although it fell harmless on the ground, yet by the mere\r\nsight of it terrified them so greatly, that in alarm at the strange\r\nspectacle they all fell back and endeavoured to retreat.\r\n\r\n12. But their officers ordering the trumpets to sound a charge, the\r\nbattle was renewed; and the Romans, as before, got the advantage, not a\r\nsingle javelin or bullet hurled by a slinger failing of its effect. For\r\nthe troops of the generals who led the vanguard, and who were inflamed\r\nby the desire of possessing themselves of the treasures which Valens had\r\nso wickedly acquired, were followed closely by others who were vain of\r\nexposing themselves to as much danger as those of greater renown. And\r\nsome were wounded almost to death: others were struck down, crushed by\r\nhuge weights, or pierced through their breasts with javelins; some who\r\ncarried ladders and attempted to scale the walls on different sides were\r\nburied under their own burthens, being beaten down by stones which were\r\nhurled upon them, and by fragments of pillars and cylinders.\r\n\r\n13. And yet, horrible as the sight of this bloodshed was, so great was\r\ntheir ardour that no one relaxed in his gallant exertions till the\r\nevening, being encouraged by seeing many of the garrison also fall by\r\nvarious wounds. So, without rest or relaxation, both the besiegers and\r\nthe besieged fought with unwearied courage.\r\n\r\n14. And now no kind of order was observed by the enemy, but they fought\r\nin detached bands and in skirmishes (which is the sign of the extremity\r\nof despair); and at last, when evening came on, they all returned to\r\ntheir tents, sorrowfully, each man accusing his neighbour of\r\ninconsiderate rashness, because they had not taken the advice of\r\nFritigern, and avoided the labours and dangers of a siege.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI.\r\n\r\n§ 1. After the battle, the soldiers devoted the whole night (which, as\r\nit was summer, was not long) to tending the wounded with all the\r\nremedies known to their nations, and when daylight returned they began\r\nto discuss various plans, doubting what to do. And after many plans had\r\nbeen proposed and objected to, they at last decided to occupy Perinthus,\r\nand then, every place where they could hear that any treasures were\r\nstored up, the deserters and fugitives having given them all the\r\ninformation they required, so that they learnt what was in every house,\r\nto say nothing of what was in every city. Adopting this resolution\r\nunanimously, which they thought the best, they advanced by slow marches,\r\nravaging and burning everything as they passed.\r\n\r\n2. But those who had been besieged in Hadrianople, after the barbarians\r\nhad departed, as soon as scouts of approved fidelity had reported that\r\nthe whole place was free from enemies, issued forth at midnight, and\r\navoiding the public causeways, took out-of-way roads through the woods,\r\nand withdrew, some to Philippopolis, and from thence to Serdica, others\r\nto Macedonia; with all the wealth which they had saved undiminished, and\r\npressing on with the greatest exertion and celerity, as if they were\r\nlikely to find Valens in those regions, since they were wholly ignorant\r\nthat he had perished in battle, or else certainly (as is rather\r\nbelieved) burnt to death in the cottage.\r\n\r\n3. Meanwhile the Goths, combining with the Huns and Alani, both brave\r\nand warlike tribes, and inured to toil and hardship, whom Fritigern had\r\nwith great ability won over to his side by the temptation of great\r\nrewards--fixed their camp near Perinthus; but recollecting their\r\nprevious losses, they did not venture to come close to the city, or make\r\nany attempt to take it; they, however, devastated and entirely stripped\r\nthe fertile territory surrounding it, slaying or making prisoners of the\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\n4. From hence they marched with speed to Constantinople in battle array,\r\nfrom fear of ambuscades; being eager to make themselves masters of its\r\nample riches, and resolved to try every means to take that illustrious\r\ncity. But while giving way to extravagant pride, and beating almost\r\nagainst the barriers of the gates, they were repulsed in this instance\r\nby the Deity.\r\n\r\n5. A body of Saracens (a nation of whose origin and manners we have\r\nalready given a full account in several places), being more suited for\r\nsallies and skirmishes than for pitched battles, had been lately\r\nintroduced into the city; and, as soon as they saw the barbarian host,\r\nthey sallied out boldly from the city to attack it. There was a stubborn\r\nfight for some time; and at last both armies parted on equal terms.\r\n\r\n6. But a strange and unprecedented incident gave the final advantage to\r\nthe eastern warriors; for one of them with long hair, naked--with the\r\nexception of a covering round his waist--shouting a hoarse and\r\nmelancholy cry, drew his dagger and plunged into the middle of the\r\nGothic host, and after he had slain an enemy, put his lips to his\r\nthroat, and sucked his blood. The barbarians were terrified at this\r\nmarvellous prodigy, and from that time forth, when they proceeded on any\r\nenterprise, displayed none of their former and usual ferocity, but\r\nadvanced with hesitating steps.\r\n\r\n7. As time went on their ardour damped, and they began to take into\r\nconsideration the vast circuit of the walls (which was the greater on\r\naccount of the large space occupied by mansions with gardens within it),\r\nthe inaccessible beauties of the city, and the immensity of its\r\npopulation; also the vicinity of the strait which divides the Black Sea\r\nfrom the Ægean. Then after destroying the works which they had\r\nconstructed, having sustained greater losses than they had inflicted,\r\nthey raised the siege, and roamed at random over the northern provinces,\r\nwhich they traversed without restraint as far as the Julian Alps, which\r\nthe ancients used to call the Venetian Alps.\r\n\r\n8. At this time the energy and promptitude of Julius, the commander of\r\nthe forces on the other side of Mount Taurus, was particularly\r\ndistinguished; for when he learnt what had happened in Thrace, he sent\r\nsecret letters to all the governors of the different cities and forts,\r\nwho were all Romans (which at this time is not very common), requesting\r\nthem, on one and the same day, as at a concerted signal, to put to death\r\nall the Goths who had previously been admitted into the places under\r\ntheir charge; first luring them into the suburbs, in expectation of\r\nreceiving the pay which had been promised to them. This wise plan was\r\ncarried out without any disturbance or any delay; and thus the Eastern\r\nprovinces were delivered from great dangers.\r\n\r\n9. Thus have I, a Greek by birth, and formerly a soldier, related all\r\nthe events from the accession of Nerva to the death of Valens, to the\r\nbest of my abilities; professing above all things to tell the truth,\r\nwhich, as I believe, I have never knowingly perverted, either by silence\r\nor by falsehood. Let better men in the flower of their age, and of\r\neminent accomplishments, relate the subsequent events. But if it should\r\nplease them to undertake the task, I warn them to sharpen their tongues\r\nto a loftier style.\r\n\r\n\r\n[189] The text is unusually mutilated here.
