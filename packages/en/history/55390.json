In the center stands the beautiful\r\n    female figure typifying Industry. To the right are the goddesses\r\n    of Music, Electricity, Literature and Art. Navigation is noted in\r\n    the anchor and chain leaning against the capstan; the Railroad,\r\n    in the rails and cross-ties; Machinery, in the cog-wheels,\r\n    steam governor, etc.; Labor, in the brawny smiths at the anvil;\r\n    Pottery, in the ornamented vase; Architecture, in the magnificent\r\n    Roman columns; Science, in the figure with quill in hand. In the\r\n    back of picture are suggestions of the progress and development\r\n    of our wonderful navy. Above all hovers the angel of Fame ready\r\n    to crown victorious Genius and Labor with the laurel wreaths of\r\n    Success.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRIUMPHS AND WONDERS\r\n  OF THE\r\n  19TH CENTURY\r\n\r\n  THE\r\n  TRUE MIRROR OF A PHENOMENAL ERA\r\n\r\n\r\n  A VOLUME OF ORIGINAL, ENTERTAINING AND INSTRUCTIVE HISTORIC\r\n  AND DESCRIPTIVE WRITINGS, SHOWING THE MANY AND\r\n  MARVELLOUS ACHIEVEMENTS WHICH DISTINGUISH\r\n\r\n  AN HUNDRED YEARS\r\n  OF\r\n  Material, Intellectual, Social and Moral Progress\r\n\r\n  EMBRACING AS SUBJECTS ALL THOSE WHICH BEST TYPE THE GENIUS,\r\n  SPIRIT AND ENERGY OF THE AGE, AND SERVE TO BRING INTO\r\n  BRIGHTEST RELIEF THE GRAND MARCH OF IMPROVEMENT\r\n  IN THE VARIOUS DOMAINS OF\r\n  HUMAN ACTIVITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  BY\r\n  JAMES P.

ISBISTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY\r\n\r\n\r\nMeasuring epochs, or eras, by spaces of a hundred years each, that\r\nwhich embraces the nineteenth century stands out in sublime and\r\nencouraging contrast with any that has preceded it. As the legatee of\r\nall prior centuries, it has enlarged and ennobled its bequest to an\r\nextent unparalleled in history; while it has at the same time, through\r\na genius and energy peculiar to itself, created an original endowment\r\nfor its own enjoyment and for the future richer by far than any\r\nheretofore recorded. Indeed, without permitting existing and pardonable\r\npride to endanger rigid truth, it may be said that along many of the\r\nlines of invention and progress which have most intimately affected the\r\nlife and civilization of the world, the nineteenth century has achieved\r\ntriumphs and accomplished wonders equal, if not superior, to all other\r\ncenturies combined.\r\n\r\nTherefore, what more fitting time than at its close to pass in\r\npleasing and instructive review the numerous material and intellectual\r\nachievements that have so distinguished it, and have contributed in so\r\nmany and such marvelous ways to the great advance and genuine comfort\r\nof the human race! Or, what could prove a greater source of pride and\r\nprofit than to compare its glorious works with those of the past, the\r\nbetter to understand and measure the actual steps and real extent of\r\nthe progress of mankind! Or, what more delightful and inspiring than\r\nto realize that the sum of those wonderful activities, of which each\r\nreader is, or has been, a part, has gone to increase the grandeur of a\r\nworld era whose rays will penetrate and brighten the coming centuries!\r\n\r\nAmid so many and such strong reasons this volume finds excellent cause\r\nfor its being. Its aims are to mirror a wonderful century from the\r\nvantage ground of its closing year; to faithfully trace the lines which\r\nmark its almost magical advance; to give it that high and true historic\r\nplace whence its contrasts with the past can be best noted, and its\r\nlight upon the future most directly thrown.\r\n\r\nThis task would be clearly beyond the power of a single mind. So rapid\r\nhas progress been during some parts of the century, so amazing have\r\nbeen results along the lines of discovery and invention, so various\r\nhave been the fields of action, that only those of special knowledge\r\nand training could be expected to do full justice to the many subjects\r\nto be treated.\r\n\r\nHence, the work has been planned so as to give it a value far beyond\r\nwhat could be imparted by a single mind. Each of the themes chosen\r\nto type the century’s grand march has been treated by an author of\r\nspecial fitness, and high up in his or her profession or calling, with\r\na view to securing for readers the best thoughts and facts relating to\r\nthe remarkable events of an hundred years. In this respect the volume\r\nis unique and original. Its authorship is not of one mind, but of a\r\ncorps of minds, whose union assures what the occasion demands.\r\n\r\nThe scope, character, and value of the volume further appear in its\r\nvery large number and practical feature of subjects selected to show\r\nthe active forces, the upward and onward movements, and the grand\r\nresults that have operated within, and triumphantly crowned, an era\r\nwithout parallel. These subjects embrace the sciences of the century\r\nin their numerous divisions and conquests; its arts and literature;\r\nindustrial, commercial, and financial progress; land and sea prowess;\r\neducational, social, moral, and religious growth; in fact, every field\r\nof enterprise and achievement within the space of time covered by the\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nA volume of such variety of subject and great extent affords fine\r\nopportunity for illustration. The publishers have taken full advantage\r\nof this, and have beautified it in a manner which commends itself to\r\nevery eye and taste. Rarely has a volume been so highly and elegantly\r\nembellished. Each subject is illuminated so as to increase the pleasure\r\nof reading and make an impression which will prove lasting.\r\n\r\nAs to its aim and scope, its number of specially qualified authors, its\r\nvigor and variety of style and thought, its historic comprehensiveness\r\nand exactness, its great wealth of illustration, its superb mechanism,\r\nits various other striking features, the volume may readily rank as one\r\nof the century’s triumphs, a wonder of industrious preparation, and\r\nacceptable to all. At any rate, no such volume has ever mirrored any\r\nprevious century, and none will come to reflect the nineteenth century\r\nwith truer line and color.\r\n\r\nNot only is the work a rare and costly picture, filled in with\r\ninspiring details by master hands, but it is equally a monument, whose\r\nsolid base, grand proportions, and elegant finish are in keeping with\r\nthe spirit of the era it marks and the results it honors. Its every\r\ninscription is a glowing tribute to human achievement of whatever kind\r\nand wherever the field of action may lie, and therefore a happy means\r\nof conveying to twentieth century actors the story of a time whose\r\nglories they will find it hard to excel. May this picture and monument\r\nbe viewed, studied, and admired by all, so that the momentous chapters\r\nwhich round the history of a closing century shall avail in shaping the\r\nbeginnings of a succeeding one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHORS AND SUBJECTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                      JAMES P.

BOYD, A.M., L.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. AT THE DAWN OF THE CENTURY.\r\n\r\nWhen, in his “Midsummer Night’s Dream,” Shakespeare placed in the mouth\r\nof Puck, prince of fairies, the playful speech,—\r\n\r\n   “I’ll put a girdle round about the earth\r\n    In forty minutes,”\r\n\r\nhe had no thought that the undertaking of a boastful and prankish\r\nsprite could ever be outdone by human agency. Could the immortal bard\r\nhave lived to witness the time when the girdling of the earth by means\r\nof the electric current became easier and swifter than elfin promise or\r\npossibility, he must have speedily remodeled his splendid comedy and\r\ndenied to the world its delightful, fairy-like features.\r\n\r\nAn old and charming story runs, that Aladdin, son of a widow of Bagdad,\r\nbecame owner of a magic lamp, by means of whose remarkable powers he\r\ncould bring to his instant aid the services of an all-helpful genie.\r\nWhen Aladdin wished for aid of any kind, he had but to rub the lamp. At\r\nonce the genie appeared to gratify his desires. By means of the lamp\r\nAladdin could hear the faintest whisper thousands of miles away. He\r\ncould annihilate both time and space, and in a twinkling could transfer\r\nhimself to the tops of the highest mountains. How the charm of this\r\nancient story is lost in the presence of that marvelous realism which\r\nmarks the achievements of modern electrical science!\r\n\r\nThe earliest known observations on that subtle mystery which pervades\r\nall nature, that silent energy whose phenomena and possibilities are\r\nlimitless, and before which even the wisest must stand in awe, are\r\nattributed to Thales, a scholar of Miletus, in Greece, some 600 years\r\nB. C. On rubbing a piece of amber against his clothing, he observed\r\nthat it gained the strange property of at first attracting and then\r\nrepelling light objects brought near to it. His observations led to\r\nnothing practical, and no historic mention of electrical phenomena is\r\nfound till the time of Theophrastus (B. C. 341), who wrote that amber,\r\nwhen rubbed, attracted “straws, small sticks, and even thin pieces of\r\ncopper and iron.” Both Aristotle and Pliny speak of the electric eel as\r\nhaving power to benumb animals with which it comes in contact.\r\n\r\nThus far these simple phenomena only had been mentioned. There was no\r\nstudy of electric force, no recognition of it as such, or as we know\r\nit and turn it to practical account to-day. This seems quite strange\r\nwhen we consider the culture and power to investigate of the Egyptians,\r\nPhœnicians, Greeks, and Romans. True, a few fairy-like stories of how\r\ncertain persons emitted sparks from their bodies, or were cured of\r\ndiseases by shocks from electric eels, are found scattered through\r\ntheir literatures, but they failed to follow the way to electrical\r\nscience pointed out to them by Thales. Even in the Middle Ages, when a\r\nfew scientists and writers saw fit to speak of electrical phenomena as\r\nobserved by the ancients, and even ventured to speculate upon them in\r\ntheir crude way, there were no practical additions made to the science,\r\nand the ground laid as fallow as it had done since the creation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD FRANKLIN ELECTRICAL MACHINE.\r\n\r\n(By permission of Franklin Institute.)]\r\n\r\nAfter a lapse of more than two thousand years from the experiment of\r\nThales, Dr. Gilbert, physician to Queen Elizabeth (A. D. 1533–1603),\r\ntook up the study of amber and various other substances which, when\r\nsubjected to friction, acquired the property of first, attracting\r\nand then repelling light bodies brought near them. He published his\r\nobservations in a little book called “De Magnete,” in the year A. D.\r\n1600, and thus became the first author of a work upon electricity. In\r\nthis unique and initial work upon simple electrical effects, the author\r\nadded greatly to the number of substances that could be electrified by\r\nfriction, and succeeded in establishing the different degrees of force\r\nwith which they could be made to attract or repel light bodies brought\r\nnear them.\r\n\r\nFortunately for electrical science, and for that matter all sciences,\r\nabout this time the influence of Lord Bacon’s Inductive Philosophy\r\nbegan to be felt by investigators and scientific men. Before that,\r\nthe causes of natural phenomena had not been backed up by repeated\r\nexperiments amounting to practical proofs, but had been accounted\r\nfor, if at all, by sheer guesses or whimsical reasons. Bacon’s method\r\nintroduced hard, cold, constant experiment as the only sure means of\r\nfinding out exactly the causes of natural phenomena; and not only this,\r\nbut the necessity of series upon series of experiments, each based\r\nupon the results of the former, and so continuing, link by link, till,\r\nfrom a comparison of the whole, some general principle or truth could\r\nbe drawn that applied to all. This _inductive_ method of scientific\r\nresearch gave great impetus to the study of every branch of science,\r\nand especially to the unfolding of infallible and practical laws\r\ngoverning the phenomena of nature.\r\n\r\nFor very many years electrical experiments followed the lines laid\r\ndown by Dr. Gilbert; that is, the finding of substances that could be\r\nexcited or electrified by friction. By and by such substances came to\r\nbe called _electrics_, and it became a part of the crude electrical\r\nscience of the time to compute the force with which these electrics,\r\nwhen excited, attracted or repelled other substances near them.\r\nAmong the ablest of these investigators were Robert Boyle, author of\r\n“Experiments on the Origin of Electricity,” Sir Isaac Newton, Otto\r\nvon Guericke, and Francis Hawksbee, the last of whom communicated his\r\nexperiments to the English Royal Society in 1705. Otto von Guericke\r\nused a hard roll of sulphur as an electric. He caused it to revolve\r\nrapidly while he rubbed or excited it with his hand. Newton and\r\nHawksbee used a revolving glass globe in the same way, and thus became\r\nthe parents of the modern and better equipped electrical machine used\r\nfor school purposes.\r\n\r\nThe next step in electrical discovery, and one which marks an epoch in\r\nthe history of the science, was made by Stephen Gray, of England, in\r\n1729. To him is due the credit of finding out that electricity from an\r\nexcited glass cylinder could be conducted away from it to objects at a\r\nremote distance. Though he used only a packthread as a conductor, he\r\nthus carried electricity to a distance of several hundred feet, and his\r\nnovel discovery opened up what, for the time, was a brilliant series\r\nof experiments in England and throughout France and Germany. Out of\r\nthese experiments came the knowledge that some substances were natural\r\nconductors of electricity, while others were non-conductors; and that\r\nthe non-conductors were the very substances—glass, resin, sulphur,\r\netc.—which were then in popular use as electrics. Here was laid the\r\nfoundation of those after-discoveries which led to the selection of\r\ncopper, iron, and other metals as the natural and therefore best\r\nconductors of electricity, and glass, etc., as the best insulators or\r\nnon-conductors.\r\n\r\nUp to this time an excited electric, such as a glass cylinder or\r\nwheel, had furnished the only source whence electricity had been drawn\r\nfor purposes of experiment. But now another great step forward was\r\ntaken by the momentous discovery that electricity, as furnished by\r\nthe excited but quickly exhausted electric, could be bottled up, as\r\nit were, and so accumulated and preserved in large quantities, to be\r\ndrawn upon when needed for experiment. It is not known who made this\r\nimportant discovery; but by common consent the storage apparatus,\r\nwhich was to play so conspicuous a part in after-investigations, was\r\nnamed the _Leyden Jar_ or _Phial_, from the city of Leyden in Holland.\r\nIt consisted of a simple glass jar lined inside and out with tinfoil\r\nto within an inch or two of the top, the tinfoil of the inside being\r\nconnected by a conductor passing up through the stopper of the jar\r\nto a metallic knob on top. This jar could be charged or filled with\r\nelectricity from a common electric, and it had the power of retaining\r\nthe charge till the knob on top was touched by the knuckle, or some\r\nunelectrified substance, when a spark ensued, and the jar was said to\r\nbe discharged. By conductors attached to the knob, guns were fired off\r\nat a distance by means of the spark, and it is said that Dr. Benjamin\r\nFranklin ignited a glass of brandy at the house of a friend by means\r\nof a wire attached to a Leyden jar and stretched the full width of the\r\nSchuylkill River at Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEYDEN JAR.]\r\n\r\nAt this stage in the history of eighteenth century electricity there\r\nenters a character whose experiments in electricity, and whose\r\nwritings upon the subject, not only brought him great renown at home\r\nand abroad, but perhaps did more to systematize the science and turn\r\nit to practical account than those of any contemporary. This was the\r\ncelebrated Dr. Benjamin Franklin, of Philadelphia, Pa. He showed to the\r\nworld that electricity was not created by friction upon an electric,\r\nbut that it was merely gathered there, when friction was applied, from\r\nsurrounding nature; and in proof of his theory he invaded the clouds\r\nwith a kite during a thunder-storm, and brought down electricity\r\ntherefrom by means of the kite-string as a conductor. The key he hung\r\non the string became charged with the electric fluid, and on being\r\ntouched by an unelectrified body, emitted sparks and produced all the\r\neffects commonly witnessed in the discharge of the Leyden jar.\r\n\r\nFranklin further established the difference between positive and\r\nnegative electricity, and showed that the spark phenomenon on the\r\ndischarge of the Leyden jar was due to the fact that the inside tinfoil\r\nwas positively electrified and the outside tinfoil negatively. When\r\nthe inside tinfoil was suddenly drawn upon by a conductor, the spark\r\nwas simply the result of an effort upon the part of the two kinds\r\nof electricity to maintain an equilibrium. By similar reasoning he\r\naccounted for the phenomenon of lightning in the clouds, and by easy\r\nsteps invented the lightning-rod, as a means of breaking the force\r\nof the descending bolt, and carrying the dangerous fluid safely to\r\nthe ground. Here we have not only a practical result growing out\r\nof electrical experiments, but we witness the dawn of an era when\r\nelectricity was to be turned to profitable commercial account. The\r\nlightning-rod man has been abroad in the world ever since the days of\r\nFranklin.\r\n\r\nThus far, then, electrical science, if science it could yet be called,\r\nhad gotten on at the dawn of the nineteenth century. No electricity\r\nwas really known but that produced by friction upon glass, or some\r\nother convenient electric. Hence it was called _frictional_ electricity\r\nby some, and _static_ electricity by others, because it was regarded\r\nas electricity in a state of rest. Though a thing fitted for curious\r\nexperiment, and a constant invitation to scientific research, it had\r\nno use whatever in the arts. An excited electric could furnish but a\r\ntrivial and temporary supply of electricity. It exhausted itself in the\r\nexhibition of a single spark.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE NEW NINETEENTH CENTURY ELECTRICITY.\r\n\r\nBy a happy accident in 1790, Galvani, of Bologna, Italy, while\r\nexperimenting upon a frog, discovered that he could produce alternate\r\nmotion between its nerves and muscles through the agency of a fluid\r\ngenerated by certain dissimilar metals when brought close together.\r\nThough this mysterious fluid came to be known as the galvanic fluid,\r\nand though galvanism was made to perpetuate his name, it was not until\r\n1800 that Volta, another Italian, showed to the scientific world that\r\nreally a new electricity had been found.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRANKLIN INSTITUTE, PHILADELPHIA.\r\n\r\n(From photo furnished by Institute.)]\r\n\r\nVolta constructed what became known as the galvanic pile, but more\r\nlargely since as the voltaic pile, which he found would generate\r\nelectricity strongly and continuously. He used in its construction\r\nthe dissimilar metals silver and zinc, cut into disks, and piled\r\nalternately one upon the other, but separated by pieces of cloth\r\nmoistened with salt water. This simple generator of electricity was the\r\nforerunner of the more powerful batteries of the present day, and which\r\nare still popularly known as voltaic cells or batteries.\r\n\r\nBut the importance of Volta’s discovery did not lay more in the\r\nconstruction of his electrical generator than in the great scientific\r\nfact that chemistry now became linked indissolubly with electricity\r\nand electrical effects. The two novel and charming sciences, hitherto\r\nseparate, were henceforth to coöperate in those majestic revelations\r\nand magnificent possibilities which so signally distinguish the\r\nnineteenth century. By means of greatly improved voltaic cells or\r\nbatteries, that is, by jars containing acid in which were suspended\r\ndissimilar metals, electricity could be produced readily and in\r\nsomewhat continuous current. By increasing the number of these cells\r\nor jars or batteries, and connecting them with conductors, the current\r\ncould be made stronger and more effective. In contradistinction to the\r\nold frictional or static electricity, the new became known as chemical\r\nor current electricity.\r\n\r\nAs was to have been expected, Volta’s invention and discovery excited\r\nthe whole domain of electrical science to new investigation, and\r\nbrought in their train a host of wonderful results, growing more and\r\nmore practical each year, and pointing the way more and more clearly to\r\nthe commercial value of electricity as a familiar, inexhaustible, and\r\nirresistible power. Thus, in 1801, Nicholson showed that an electric\r\ncurrent from a voltaic pile would, when passed through salt water,\r\ndecompose the water and resolve it into its two original gases, oxygen\r\nand hydrogen. In 1807, Sir Humphrey Davy, carrying electricity further\r\ninto the domain of chemistry, showed, by means of the electric current,\r\nthat various metallic substances embraced in the earth’s crust, and\r\nbefore his time supposed to be elementary, were really dissoluble and\r\neasily resolved into their component parts, whether solids, or gases,\r\nor both. Two years later, in 1809, he made the equally momentous\r\ndiscovery of something which was to prove a veritable _sit lux_, “Let\r\nthere be light,” for the nineteenth century, and illuminate it beyond\r\nall others. Though it had been known almost from the date of the\r\nfirst voltaic pile that, when the ends of its two conducting wires\r\nwere brought close together, a spark was seen to leap in a curved or\r\narc line from one wire to the other, which phenomenon was known as\r\nthe voltaic arc, it remained for Davy to exhibit this arc in all the\r\nbeauty of a brilliant light by using two charcoal (carbon) sticks or\r\nelectrodes, instead of the wires, at the point of close approach. Here\r\nwas the first principle of the after-evolved arc light to be found\r\nby the end of the century in every large city, and to prove such a\r\nsource of comfort and safety for their millions of inhabitants. This\r\nprinciple was simply that a stream of electricity pouring along a\r\nconducting wire will, when interrupted by a substance such as carbon\r\n(charcoal), which is a slow conductor, throw off a bright light at the\r\npoint of interruption. The phenomenon has been very aptly likened to a\r\nrunning stream of water in whose bed a stone has been placed. The stone\r\nobstructs the flow of water. The water remonstrates by an angry ripple\r\nand excited roar. In Davy’s experiment with the pieces of charcoal,\r\nboth became intensely hot while the electricity was making its\r\nbrilliant arc leap from one to the other, and would, of course, soon\r\nbe consumed. He, therefore, in showing the principle of a permanent\r\nluminant, failed to demonstrate its practical possibilities. These last\r\nwere not to be attained till the nineteenth century was well along, and\r\nonly after very numerous and very baffling attempts.\r\n\r\nBetween 1810 and 1830, many important laws governing electrical\r\nphenomena were discovered, which tended greatly to render the\r\nscience more exact, and to give it commercial direction. Oersted, of\r\nDenmark, discovered a means of measuring the strength and direction\r\nof an electric current. Ampère, of France, discovered the identity\r\nof electricity and what had before been called galvanism. Ritchie,\r\nof England, made the first machine by which a continuous motion was\r\nproduced by means of the attractions and repulsions between fixed\r\nmagnets and electro-magnets. This machine was an early suggestion of\r\nthe dynamo and motor of the coming years of the century. It meant that\r\nelectricity was a source of power, as well as of other phenomenal\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the electro-magnet in connection with Ritchie’s machine,\r\nit is proper to say that the electro-magnet was probably discovered\r\nbetween 1825 and 1830, but precisely by whom is not known. It differs\r\nfrom the natural magnet, or the permanent steel horseshoe magnet, and\r\nconsists simply of a round piece of soft iron, called a core, around\r\nwhich are wrapped several coils of fine wire. When an electric current\r\nis made to pass through this wrapping of wire, called the helix, the\r\niron core becomes magnetized, and has all the power of a permanent\r\nmagnet. But as soon as the electric current ceases, the magnetic\r\npower of the core is lost. Hence it is called an electro-magnet, or a\r\ntemporary magnet, to distinguish it from a permanent magnet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INDUCTION COIL.]\r\n\r\nWhile the discovery of the electro-magnet was very important in the\r\nrespect that it afforded great magnetic power by the use of a limited\r\nor economic galvanic force, or, in other words, by the use of smaller\r\nand fewer Voltaic batteries, it was not until Faraday began his\r\nsplendid series of electrical discoveries, in 1831, that a new and\r\nexhaustless wellspring of electricity was found to lay at the door\r\nof science. Faraday’s prime discovery was that of the induction of\r\nelectric currents, or, in other words, of manufacturing electricity\r\ndirectly from magnetism. He began his experiments with what became\r\nknown as an induction coil, which, though then crude in his hands, is\r\nthe same in principle to-day. It consists of an iron core wrapped\r\nwith two coils of insulated wire. One coil is of very lengthy, thin\r\nwire, and is called the secondary coil. The other is of short, thick\r\nwire, and is called the primary. When a magnetic current is passed\r\nthrough the primary coil, with frequent makes and breaks, it induces\r\nan alternating current of very high tension in the secondary coil,\r\nthus powerfully increasing its effects. In Faraday’s further study of\r\nelectric induction, he showed that when a conductor carrying a current\r\nwas brought near to a second conductor it induced or set up a current\r\nin this second. So magnets were found to have a similar effect upon one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAGNETIC FIELDS OF FORCE.]\r\n\r\nThe secret of these phenomena was found to lie in the fact that\r\na magnet, or a conductor carrying a current, was the centre of a\r\nfield of force of very considerable extent. Such a field of force\r\ncan be familiarly shown by placing a piece of glass or white paper\r\nsprinkled with fine iron filings upon the poles of a magnet. The\r\nfilings will be drawn into concentric circles, whose extent measures\r\nthe magnet’s field of force. So also the extent of the field of force\r\nsurrounding a conductor carrying a current may be familiarly shown.\r\nIn these instances the filings brought within the fields of force are\r\nmagnetized. So would any other conducting substance be, and would\r\nbecome capable of carrying away as an independent current that which\r\nhad been induced in it. Here we have the essential principle of the\r\nmodern dynamo-electric machine, commonly called simply dynamo. Faraday\r\nactually constructed a dynamo, which answered very well for his\r\nexperiments, but failed in commercial results because the only source\r\nof energy he could draw upon in his time was that supplied by the\r\nrather costly voltaic cells.\r\n\r\nDuring Faraday’s time and subsequently, electricians in Europe and the\r\nUnited States were active in formulating further laws relative to the\r\nnature, strength, and control of electrical currents, and each year was\r\none of preparation for the coming leap of electrical science into the\r\nvast realm of commercial convenience and profit.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE TELEGRAPH.\r\n\r\nFrom the date of the discovery that electricity could be conducted\r\nto a distance, dreams were indulged that it could be made a means of\r\ncommunicating intelligence. In the eighteenth century, many attempts\r\nwere made to carry intelligent signals over electric wires. Some of\r\nthese were quite ingenious, but in the end failures, because the\r\nold-fashioned frictional electricity was the only kind then known and\r\nemployed. Even after the discovery of the voltaic cell or battery,\r\nwhich afforded an ample supply of chemical electricity to operate a\r\ntelegraphic apparatus, the time was not ripe for successful telegraphy,\r\nfor up till 1830 no battery had been produced that was sufficiently\r\nconstant in its operation to supply the kind of current required.\r\nFor feasible telegraphy, two important steps were yet necessary. One\r\nwas the discovery of the electro-magnet, 1825–30. The other was the\r\ndiscovery of the Daniell’s battery or cell, in 1836, by means of which\r\na constant electric current could be sustained for a long time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DANIELL’S CELLS.]\r\n\r\nBut even before these two indispensable requisites had been supplied\r\nby human genius, much had been done to develop the mechanical methods\r\nof conveying intelligence. In 1816, Ronalds, of England, constructed\r\na telegraph by means of which he operated a system of pith-ball\r\nsignals which could be understood. In 1820, Ampère suggested that the\r\ndeflection of the magnetic needle by an electric current might be\r\nturned to account in imparting intelligence at a distance. In 1828,\r\nDyar, of New York, perfected a telegraph by means of which he made\r\ntracings and spaces upon a piece of moving litmus paper, which tracings\r\nand spaces could be intelligently interpreted through a prearranged\r\ncode. A little later, 1830, Baron Schilling constructed a telegraph\r\nwhich imparted motion to a set of needles at either end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MORSE TELEGRAPH AND BATTERY.]\r\n\r\nFrom this time up to 1837, which last year was a memorable one in the\r\nhistory of telegraphy, the genius of such distinguished men as Morse\r\nin America, Wheatstone and Cooke in England, and Steinhill in Munich,\r\nwas brought to bear on the further evolution of the telegraph. While\r\nall these names have been associated with the invention of the first\r\npractical telegraph, it is impossible, with justice, to rob that of\r\nMorse of the distinguished honor. Morse conceived his invention on\r\nboard the ship Surry, while on a voyage from Havre to New York, in\r\nOctober, 1832. It consisted, as conceived, of a single circuit of\r\nconductors fed by some generator of electricity. He devised a system\r\nof signs, which was afterwards improved into the Morse alphabet,\r\nconsisting of dots or points, and spaces, to represent numerals. These\r\nwere impressed upon a strip of ribbon or paper by a lever which held\r\nat one end a pen or pencil. The paper or ribbon was made to move along\r\nunder the pencil or pen at a regular rate by means of clockwork. In\r\naccordance with these conceptions, Morse completed his instrument\r\nand publicly exhibited it in 1835. He gave it further publicity, in\r\nmuch improved form, in 1837. In this form it was entirely original in\r\nthe important respects that the ribbon or paper was made to move by\r\nclockwork, while a pen or pencil gave the impressions, thus preserving\r\na permanent record of the message conveyed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAMUEL FINLEY BREESE MORSE.]\r\n\r\nThough under systems less original and effective than that of Morse,\r\na first actual telegraph had been operated between Paddington and\r\nDrayton, England, a distance of 13 miles, in 1839, and one at Calcutta,\r\nIndia, for a distance of 21 miles, it was not until 1844 that the\r\nworld’s era of practical telegraphy actually set in under the Morse\r\nsystem, which speedily superseded all others. In that year, amid the\r\njeers of congressmen and the adverse predictions of the press, Morse\r\nerected the first American telegraph line in America, between Baltimore\r\nand Washington, a distance of 40 miles, and, to the confusion of all\r\ndetractors, sent the first message over it on May 27 of that year. From\r\nthat date the fame of Morse was established at home, and soon became\r\nworld-wide. His system of telegraphy, with slight modifications, became\r\nthat of all civilized countries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CYRUS W. FIELD.]\r\n\r\nAs was to be expected in a century so full of enterprise as the\r\nnineteenth, a science so attractive, so useful to civilization, so\r\ncommercially valuable, so full of possibilities, as telegraphy, could\r\nnot remain at rest. Everywhere it stimulated to improvement and new\r\ninvention and discovery; and as the century progressed, it witnessed\r\nin steady succession the wonders of what became known as duplex\r\ntelegraphy, that is, the sending of different messages over the same\r\nwire at the same time. Again, the century witnessed the invention of\r\nquadruplex telegraphy, that is, the sending of four separate messages\r\nover the same wire, two in one direction and two in another. This was\r\nfollowed by the invention of Gray’s _harmonic system_, by means of\r\nwhich a number of messages greater than four are transmitted at the\r\nsame time over the same wire; and this again by Delaney’s _synchronous\r\nmultiplex system_, by means of which as many as 72 separate messages\r\nhave been sent over the same wire at the same time, either all in one\r\ndirection, or some in one direction and the rest in an opposite.\r\n\r\nFor a time successful telegraphy was limited to overland spaces, the\r\nconductors or wires, consisting of iron or copper, being insulated\r\nwhere they passed the supporting poles. In the cities, supporting\r\npoles proved to be unsightly and dangerous, and they were succeeded\r\nby underground conduits carrying insulated wires. In 1839, we read of\r\nwhat may be reckoned the first successful experiment in telegraphing\r\nunder water by means of an insulated wire, or cable, as a conductor.\r\nThe experiment was tried at Calcutta, and under the river Hugli. In\r\n1842, Morse experimented at New York with an under-water cable, and\r\nshowed that a successful submarine telegraphy was practical. In 1848,\r\na cable, insulated with gutta-percha, was laid under water between New\r\nYork and Jersey City, and successfully operated. In 1851, a submarine\r\ncable was laid and successfully operated under the English Channel.\r\nAn enterprising American, Cyrus W. Field, of New York, now took up\r\nthe subject of submarine telegraphy, and suggested a cable under the\r\nocean between Ireland and Newfoundland. One was laid in 1857, but it\r\nunfortunately parted at a distance of three hundred miles from land. A\r\nsecond was laid under Mr. Field’s auspices in 1858, but the insulation\r\nproved faulty, and after working imperfectly for a month, it gave out\r\nentirely.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OCEAN CABLE.]\r\n\r\nThese disasters, though furnishing much valuable experience, checked\r\nthe enterprise of submarine telegraphy for a number of years. Not\r\nuntil 1861, when a deep-sea cable was successfully laid and operated\r\nbetween Malta and Alexandria, and in 1864, when one was laid across the\r\nPersian Gulf, did enterprise gain sufficient courage to dare another\r\nattempt to cable the Atlantic. In 1865, that attempt was made. Again\r\nthe cable broke, but this did not dissuade from another and successful\r\nattempt in 1866. This signal triumph was the forerunner of others,\r\nequally important to international commerce and the world’s diplomacy.\r\nCountries far apart, and isolated by oceans, have, by means of deep-sea\r\ncables, been brought into intimate relation, and made sharers of one\r\nanother’s intelligence, enterprise, and civilizing instincts. What\r\nthe overland telegraph has done toward bringing local states and\r\ncommunities into contact, the submarine cable has done for the remote\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nIn form, an ocean cable differs much from the simple wire which\r\nconstitutes the conductor of an overland or even underground telegraph.\r\nIt is made in many ways, but mostly with a central core of numerous\r\ncopper wires, which are more flexible than a single wire. These are\r\nthickly covered with an insulating material, such as gutta-percha,\r\nafter first being heavily wrapped in tarred canvas or like material.\r\nThe central cores may be one, two, three, or even more in number. Where\r\na cable is likely to be subjected to the abrasion of ship-bottoms,\r\nrocks, or anchors, it has an outer covering or guard composed of\r\nclosely united steel wires. In submarine telegraphy, the instruments\r\nused in sending and receiving the message are very much more ingenious,\r\ndelicate, and costly than in overland telegraphy.\r\n\r\nWhereas at the beginning of the nineteenth century electric telegraphy\r\nwas an unknown science, and even up to the middle of the century was\r\nof limited use and doubtful commercial value, nevertheless the end of\r\nthe century witnesses in its growth and application one of its most\r\nstupendous marvels. From the few miles of overland wires in 1844, the\r\ntotal mileage of the century has expanded to approximately 5,000,000,\r\nand the submarine to 170,000. A single company (the Western Union) in\r\nthe United States operates 800,000 miles of wire, conveying 60,000,000\r\nmessages per year, while throughout the world more than 200,000,000\r\nmessages per year serve the purposes of enlightened intercourse. The\r\ncapital employed reaches many hundreds of millions of dollars.\r\n\r\nThe close of the nineteenth century opened possibilities in telegraphy\r\nthat may be classed as startling in comparison with its previous\r\nattainments. It would seem that the intervention of the familiar\r\nconducting wire is not absolutely necessary to the transmission of\r\nintelligence. The old and well-established principle of induced\r\ncurrents has lately been turned to account in what is termed\r\n“telegraphy without wires.” As an instance, a telegraph wire, when\r\nplaced close alongside of a railroad track, will take up and convey to\r\nand from the stations the induced pulsations of a magneto-telephone\r\nplaced within a passing car, and connected to the metallic roof of the\r\ncar. This system has been put to practical use on at least one railway,\r\nand pronounced feasible.\r\n\r\nBut a greater marvel than this springs from the discovery of Hertz,\r\nabout 1890, that every electrical discharge is the centre of\r\noscillations radiating indefinitely through space. The phenomenon\r\nis likened to the dropping of a stone in a placid lake. Concentric\r\nundulations of the water are set up,—little waves,—which gradually\r\nenlarge in diameter, and affect in greater or less degree the entire\r\nsurface. Could an apparatus be invented to detect and direct the\r\noscillations made in space by an electric generator,—to perceive, as\r\nit were, the ether undulations, just as the eye notes those on the\r\nlake’s surface?\r\n\r\nIn 1891, Professor Branley found that the electric vibrations in ether\r\ncould be detected by means of fine metallic filings. No matter how good\r\na conductor of electricity the metal in mass might be, when reduced\r\nto fine filings or powder it offered powerful resistance to a passing\r\ncurrent; in other words, became a very poor conductor. An electric\r\ndischarge or spark near the filings greatly decreased their resistance.\r\nIf the filings were jarred, their original resistance was restored.\r\nBranley placed his filings in a tube, into either end of which wires\r\nwere passed. These were connected with a galvanometer. Ordinarily, the\r\nresistance of the filings was such as to prevent a current passing\r\nthrough them, and the galvanometer remained unaffected. But when an\r\nelectric spark was emitted near the tube, the resistance was so much\r\ndecreased that the current passed readily through the filings, and was\r\ndetected by the galvanometer. This is simply equivalent to saying that\r\nthe discharge of the electric spark made the filings to cohere and\r\nbecome a better conductor than when lying loosely in the tube. Here,\r\nthen, was opportunity for an instrument which had but to regulate the\r\nnumber of sparks and indicate the presence of the electric waves in\r\norder to produce dots and dashes similar to those used in the common\r\ntelegraph. Such an instrument was brought nearest to perfection by\r\nSignor Marconi, a young Italian, in 1896. With it he succeeded in\r\nsending electric waves through ether or space, and without the use of\r\nwires, a distance of four miles, upon Salisbury Plain, England. Later,\r\nhe transmitted messages by means of space (wireless) telegraphy across\r\nBristol Channel, a distance of 8.7 miles, and subsequently across the\r\nEnglish Channel, a distance of 18 miles. Mr. W. J. Clarke, of America,\r\nhas improved upon Marconi’s methods of space telegraphy, and shown some\r\nremarkable results. Whether space telegraphy will eventually supersede\r\nthat by wires is one of the problems that time only can solve. But\r\nsuch are the possibilities of electrical science that we may well be\r\nprepared for more wonderful revelations than any yet made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GREAT EASTERN LAYING AN OCEAN CABLE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. HELLO! HELLO!\r\n\r\nTelegraph (Gr. _tele_, far, and _graphein_, to write) implies the\r\nproduction of writing at a distance by means of an electric current\r\nupon a conductor. Telephone (Gr. _tele_, far, and _phone_, sound)\r\nimplies the production of sound at a distance by the same means, though\r\nthe word telephone was in early use to describe the transmission of\r\nsound by means of a rod or tightly stretched string connecting two\r\ndiaphragms of wood, membrane, or other substance. This last plan of\r\ntransmitting sound came to be known as the string telephone, and it\r\nretained this name until the invention of the electric telephone.\r\n\r\nLike the electric telegraph, the electric telephone was an evolution.\r\nThe string telephone, in the hands of Wheatstone, showed, as early as\r\n1819, that the vibrations of the air produced by a musical instrument\r\nwere very minute, and could be transmitted hundreds of yards by means\r\nof a string armed with delicate diaphragms. But while the string\r\ntelephone served to confirm the fact that sounds are vibrations of\r\nthe atmosphere which affect the tympanum of the ear, it remained but\r\na toy or experimental device till after electric telegraphy became\r\nan accepted science, that is, in the year 1837 and subsequently. One\r\nof the earliest steps toward the evolution of the electric telephone\r\nwas taken by Mr. Page, of Salem, Mass., in 1837, who discovered\r\nthat a magnetic bar could emit sounds when rapidly magnetized and\r\ndemagnetized; and that those sounds corresponded with the number of\r\ncurrents which produced them. This led to the discovery, between\r\n1847 and 1852, of several kinds of electric vibrators adapted to the\r\nproduction of musical sounds and their transmission to a distance.\r\nAll this was wonderful and momentous, but a little while had still\r\nto elapse before one arose bold enough to admit the possibility of\r\ntransmitting human speech by electricity. He came in 1854, in the\r\nperson of Charles Bourseul, of Paris, who, though as if writing\r\nout a fanciful dream, said, “We know that sounds are produced by\r\nvibrations, and are adapted to the ear by the same vibrations which\r\nare reproduced by the intervening medium. But the intensity of the\r\nvibrations diminishes very rapidly with the distance, so that it is,\r\neven with the aid of speaking-tubes and trumpets, impossible to exceed\r\nsomewhat narrow limits. Suppose that a man speaks near a movable disk,\r\nsufficiently flexible to lose none of the vibrations of the voice, that\r\nthis disk alternately makes and breaks the current from a battery,\r\nyou may have at a distance another disk, which will at the same time\r\nexecute the same vibrations.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A STRING TELEPHONE.]\r\n\r\nBourseul further showed that the sounds of the voice thus reproduced\r\nwould have the same pitch, but admitted that, in the then present\r\nstate of acoustic science, it could not be affirmed that the syllables\r\nuttered by the human voice could be so reproduced, since nothing was\r\nknown of them, except that some were uttered by the teeth, others by\r\nthe lips, and so on. The status of the telephone then, according to\r\nBourseul, was that voice could be reproduced at a distance at the pitch\r\nof the speaker, but that something more was needed to transmit the\r\ndelicate and varied intonations of human speech when it was broken into\r\nsyllables and utterances. To transmit simply voice was one thing; to\r\ntransmit the _timbre_ or quality of speech was another.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THOMAS ALVA EDISON.]\r\n\r\nBourseul made plain the problem that was still before the investigator.\r\nAnd now comes one of the most remarkable episodes in the history of\r\nelectricity,—a chapter of mingled shame and glory. In the village of\r\nEberly’s Mills, Cumberland County, Pa., lived a genius by the name of\r\nDaniel Drawbaugh, who had made a study of telephony up to the very\r\npoint Bourseul had left it. He had transmitted musical sound, sound of\r\nthe voice, and other sounds in the same pitch. He had said that this\r\nwas all that could be done till some means was discovered of holding\r\nup the constant onward flow of the electric current along a conducting\r\nwire by introducing into such flow a variable resistance such as would\r\nimpart to simple pitch of voice the quality or _timbre_ of human\r\nspeech. Drawbaugh achieved this in his simple workshop as early as\r\n1859–60, according to evidence furnished to the United States Supreme\r\nCourt at the celebrated trial of the cases which robbed him of the\r\nright to his prior invention. He did it by introducing into the circuit\r\na small quantity of powdered charcoal confined in a tumbler, through\r\nwhich the current was passing. The charcoal, being a poor conductor and\r\nin small grains, offered just that kind of variable resistance to the\r\ncurrent necessary to reproduce the tones and syllables of speech. He\r\ntransmitted speech between his shop and house, and proved the success\r\nhe had met with before audiences in New York and Philadelphia. But he\r\nneglected to care for the commercial side of his discovery, though many\r\nof his patents antedated those which contributed to deprive him of\r\ndeserved honor and profit.\r\n\r\nIn 1861, Reis, of Germany, came into notice as the inventor of a\r\ntelephone which transmitted sound very clearly, but failed to reproduce\r\nsyllabified speech. However, the principle and shape of his transmitter\r\nand receiver were accepted by those who followed him. Two men now\r\ncame upon the scene who had reached the conclusion already arrived at\r\nby Drawbaugh, and who became rivals over his head for the honor and\r\nprofit of an invention by means of which the quality of the voice in\r\nspeaking could be transmitted. These two were Elisha Gray, of Chicago,\r\nand Alexander Graham Bell, of Boston. Their respective devices seem\r\nto have been akin, and to have been presented to the patent office\r\nalmost simultaneously; so nearly so, at least, as to make them a part\r\nof that long, costly, and acrimonious legal contention over priority of\r\ninvention which did not end till 1887.\r\n\r\nBoth Bell and Gray reached the conclusion that the transmission of\r\narticulate speech was impossible unless they could produce electrical\r\nundulations corresponding exactly with the vibrations of the air\r\nor sound waves. They brought this similarity about by introducing\r\na variable resistance into the electric current by means of an\r\ninterposing liquid, just as Drawbaugh had done years before with\r\nhis tumbler of powdered charcoal. Bell exhibited his instrument\r\nwith comparative success at the Centennial Exhibition in 1876 in\r\nPhiladelphia; but much had yet to be done to perfect a telephone of\r\nreal commercial value.\r\n\r\nThe years 1877–78 were years of great activity among electricians,\r\nwhose prime object was to perfect a telephone transmitter and receiver,\r\nby means of whose mutual operations at opposite ends of a circuit all\r\nthe modulations of speech could be preserved and passed. To this end\r\nBerliner introduced into a transmitter or sender the then well-known\r\nprinciple of the microphone (Gr. _mikros_, small, _phone_, sound),\r\nwhich magnified the faint sounds by the variation in electrical\r\nresistance, caused by variation of pressure at loose contact between\r\ntwo metal points or electrodes. Edison quickly followed with a\r\nsimilar transmitter or sender, in which one of the electrodes was of\r\nsoft carbon, the other of metal. Then came (1878) Hughes and Blake\r\nwith senders, in which both of the electrodes were of hard carbon.\r\nSubsequently came other and rapid modifications of the sender, both in\r\nthe United States and Europe, till the form of telephone now in popular\r\nuse was arrived at, and which, strange to say, is, in its method of\r\nsecuring the necessary variable resistance in the circuit, quite like\r\nthat employed by Mr. Drawbaugh; to wit, the introduction of fine carbon\r\ngranules into a small metal cup just behind the vibrating diaphragm\r\nor disk of the sender. The circuit goes into the diaphragm in front,\r\npassing through the carbon granules and out through the back of the\r\ninstrument. The action of talking into the sender causes the granules\r\nto be agitated, thus opening and closing the circuit and producing\r\nthe conditions necessary to the transmission of articulate speech.\r\nThe diaphragm or disk is the very thin covering of the cup containing\r\nthe granules. It is sometimes made of carbon, but generally of hard\r\nmetal, as steel. On being struck by the sound waves of the voice, it\r\nvibrates to correspond. The same vibrations are reproduced in the\r\nreceiver at the opposite end of the circuit, and thus one listens to\r\nthe phenomenon of transmitted human speech. The current for telephonic\r\npurposes is furnished by one or more batteries or cells, whose effect\r\nis heightened by the presence of an induction coil. The tendency now\r\nis to make “bipolars”—two contacts at the diaphragm—in place of a\r\nsingle contact. This style is becoming more in vogue in order to meet\r\nthe demands of long-distance work. To each telephone is attached a\r\ngenerator or device for ringing a little bell as a signal that some one\r\nwishes to communicate. To such perfection have telephones been brought\r\nthat it is quite possible to converse intelligibly at the distance\r\nof a thousand miles, with a less satisfactory service at twice or\r\nthrice that distance. The possibilities of clear speech-transmission\r\nat indefinite distance are without measure. Like the telegraph, the\r\ntelephone has opened an immense and profitable industry, involving\r\nhundreds of millions of dollars. At the end of the century it is,\r\nunfortunately, monopolistic; but the time is near when a reasonable\r\ncharge for service will enable every business house to communicate with\r\nits customers, and when even the remote corners of counties will be\r\nbrought into touch with their capitals and with one another. Along the\r\nlines of civilizing contact the telephone fairly divides the wonders\r\nof the century with the telegraph, while for intimate intellectual\r\ncommunication it is a triumph of genius without parallel. It is the\r\ndispenser of speech in city, town, and village; in factory and mine,\r\nin army and navy; throughout government departments; and in Budapest,\r\nHungary, it is a purveyor of general news, like the newspaper, for the\r\n“Telephone Gazette” of that city has a list of regular subscribers,\r\nto whom it transmits, at private houses, clubs, cafes, restaurants,\r\nand public buildings, its editorials, telegrams, local news, and\r\nadvertisements.\r\n\r\nA very natural outgrowth of the telephone was that curious invention\r\nknown as the phonograph (Gr. _phone_, sound, and _graphein_, to write).\r\nIt is not only an instrument for writing or preserving sound, but for\r\nreproducing it. As a simple recorder of sound, it was an instrument\r\ndating as far back as 1807, when Dr. Young showed how a tuning-fork\r\nmight be made to trace a record of its own vibrations. But Young’s\r\nthought had to go through more than half a century of slow evolution\r\nbefore the modern phonograph was reached; for in the phonautograph\r\nof Scott, the logographs of Barlow and Blake, and the various other\r\nattempts up to 1877 to make and preserve tracings of speech, there were\r\nno successful means of reproducing speech from those tracings hit upon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A GRAPHOPHONE.]\r\n\r\nIn that year (1877), Edison, in striving to make a self-recording\r\ntelephone by connecting with its diaphragm or disk a stylus or metal\r\npoint which would record its vibrations upon a strip of tinfoil,\r\naccidentally reversed the motion of the tinfoil so that the tracings\r\nupon it affected the stylus or tracing-point in an opposite direction.\r\nTo his surprise, he found that this reverse motion of the tinfoil,\r\ntickling, as it were, the stylus oppositely, reproduced the sounds\r\nwhich had at first agitated the diaphragm. It was but a step now to\r\nthe production of his matured phonograph in 1878. He made a cylinder\r\nwith a grooved surface, over which he spread tinfoil. A stylus or fine\r\nmetal point was made to rest upon the tinfoil, so as to produce a\r\ntracing in it, following the grooves in the cylinder when the latter\r\nwas made to revolve. This stylus was connected with the diaphragm of an\r\nordinary telephone transmitter. When one spoke into the transmitter,\r\nthat is, set the diaphragm to vibrating, the stylus impressed the\r\nvibratory motions of the diaphragm, or, in other words, the waves\r\nof the exciting sound, in light indentations upon the tinfoil. In\r\norder to reproduce the sounds thus registered in the tinfoil of the\r\ncylinder, it was made to revolve in an opposite direction under the\r\npoint of the stylus, and as the stylus was now affected by precisely\r\nthe same indentations it had first made in the tinfoil, it carried\r\nthe identical vibrations it had recorded back to the diaphragm of the\r\ntelephone, and thus reproduced in audible form the speech that had\r\nat first set the diaphragm to vibrating. The speech thus reproduced\r\nwas that of the original speaker in pitch and quality. Ingenious and\r\nwonderful as Edison’s machine was, it was susceptible of improvement,\r\nand soon Bell and others came forward with a phonograph in which the\r\nrecording cylinder was covered with a hardened wax. This was called\r\nthe graphophone. Again, Berliner improved upon the phonograph by using\r\nfor his tracing surface a horizontal disk of zinc covered with wax.\r\nBy chemical treatment, the tracings made in the wax were etched into\r\nthe zinc, and thus made permanent. Edison made further and ingenious\r\nimprovements upon his phonograph by attaching hearing tubes for the\r\near to the sound receiver, and by the employment of an electric motor\r\nto revolve the wax cylinder. By the attachment of enlarged trumpets\r\nand other devices, every form of modern phonograph has been rendered\r\ncapable of reproducing in great perfection the various sounds of\r\nspeech, song, and instrument, and has become a most interesting source\r\nof entertainment.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. DYNAMO AND MOTOR.\r\n\r\nDynamo is from the Greek _dunamis_, meaning power. Motor is from the\r\nLatin _motus_, or _moveo_, to move. Dynamo is the every-day term\r\napplied to the dynamo-electric machine. Motor is the every-day term\r\napplied to the electric motor. The dynamo and motor are quite alike\r\nin principle of construction, yet direct opposites in object and\r\neffect. Perhaps it might be well to designate both as dynamo-electric\r\nmachines, and to say that, when such machine is used for the conversion\r\nof mechanical energy or power of any kind into electrical energy or\r\npower, it is a dynamo. When a reverse result is sought, that is, when\r\nelectrical energy or power is to be converted into mechanical energy or\r\npower, the machine that is used is a motor. In practical use for most\r\npurposes they are brought into coöperation, the dynamo being at one\r\nend of an electric system, making and sending forth electricity, the\r\nmotor being at the other end, taking up such electricity and running\r\nmachinery with it. Both machines were epoch-making in the midst of a\r\nwondrous century, and both were results of those marvelous evolutions\r\nin electrical science which characterized the earlier years of the\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how the simple glass cylinder or sulphur roll became, when\r\nrubbed, a generator of electricity. In a later chapter of electrical\r\nhistory, we saw a new and more powerful generator of electricity in\r\nthe voltaic cell, by means of opposing metals acted upon chemically\r\nby acids. The greatest, grandest, most powerful, and most economic\r\nof all generators of electricity was yet to come in the shape of the\r\ndynamo. We see its beginnings in those investigations of Faraday which\r\nled to the discovery of the induction coil and the principles of\r\nmagneto-electric induction. In 1831, he invented a simple yet, for that\r\ndate, wonderful machine, which was none the less the first dynamo in\r\nprinciple, because he modestly called it “A New Electrical Machine.” He\r\nmounted a thin disk of copper, about twelve inches in diameter, upon a\r\ncentral axis, so that it would revolve between the opposite poles of a\r\npermanent magnet. As the disk revolved, its lower half cut the field\r\nof force of the magnet, and a current was induced which was carried\r\naway by means of two collecting brushes, fastened respectively to the\r\naxis and circumference of the disk. This was the first electric current\r\never produced by a permanent magnet. The Faraday machine and others\r\nthat derived the mechanical energy which was converted into electric\r\ncurrent from a permanent magnet were classed as magneto-generators.\r\nSoon the electro-magnet took the place of the permanent magnet,\r\nbecause it produced a much stronger field of force. But then the\r\nelectro-magnet had to have a current to excite it. This current was\r\nsupplied by a magneto-generator, placed somewhere on the dynamo. Now\r\ncame the thought, suggested by Brett in 1848, that the induced currents\r\nof the dynamo could themselves be turned to account for increasing\r\nthe strength of the electro-magnets used in inducing them. This was a\r\nmost progressive step in the history of the dynamo. It led to rapid\r\ninventions, whose principle was based on the fact that every dynamo\r\ncarried within the cores of its magnets enough of unused or residual\r\nmagnetism to render the magnets self-exciting the moment the machine\r\nstarted. So the outside means of magnetizing the fields of force of the\r\ndynamo passed away.\r\n\r\nThe dynamo speedily grew in size and importance. The electro-magnets\r\nor fields of force were greatly increased in number, size, and power.\r\nThere were great improvements in the construction and efficiency\r\nof the wire coils or armatures which cut the fields of force, and\r\na corresponding increase in their number. Commutators and brushes\r\nunderwent like improvement. So, at last, the well-nigh perfect and\r\nall-powerful dynamo of the end of the century was evolved, with a\r\ncapacity for delivering, in the form of electricity, ninety per cent\r\nof the mechanical energy which set it in motion. In the application of\r\nsteam to machinery, eighty per cent, and sometimes more, of the energy\r\nsupplied by a ton of coal is lost.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A DYNAMO.]\r\n\r\nWith the perfection of the dynamo, its uses multiplied. It became a\r\nprime factor in electric lighting. Trolley systems sprang up in city,\r\ntown, and village, taking the place of horse and traction cars. In\r\ncertain places, as in the Baltimore tunnel, the dynamo superseded the\r\nengine for hauling freight and passenger cars. The mighty dynamos which\r\nconvert the inexhaustible energy of Niagara Falls into electricity\r\nsend it many miles away to Buffalo, to be applied to lighting and to\r\nevery form of machinery. The end of the century sees a power plant in\r\noperation in New York city capable of furnishing one hundred thousand\r\nhorse-power, or enough to supply the lighting, rapid transit, and\r\nthousand and one mechanical needs of the entire municipality. The\r\nessential parts of an ordinary dynamo are: (1.) The electro-magnets,\r\nwhich, however numerous, are arranged in circular form upon part of\r\nthe framework of the machine. (2.) The iron coils or armatures, mounted\r\nin a circle upon a wheel. When the wheel revolves, the armatures pass\r\nclose in front of the electro-magnets, cutting through their fields\r\nof force, and thereby inducing electric current. (3.) The commutator,\r\nwhich consists usually of a series of copper blocks arranged around the\r\naxle of the armatures, and insulated from the axle and from each other.\r\nThe current passes from the armatures to the commutator. If the current\r\nbe an alternating one, the commutator changes it into a continuous one,\r\nand the reverse may also be accomplished. (4.) The brushes, which are\r\nthin strips of copper or carbon, are brought to bear at proper points\r\nupon the commutator, making connection with each coil or sets of coils.\r\nThey carry the corrected current to the outside line or lines. (5.) The\r\noutside line or lines, to carry the current away to the motor. (6.) The\r\npulley for strap-belting, by means of which the water or steam power\r\nused is made to turn the dynamo machine.\r\n\r\nBut we must not forget the motor as a companion of the dynamo, as its\r\nindispensable brother, in turning to practical account the electricity\r\nsent to it. As we have seen, the motor is the reverse of the dynamo, at\r\nleast in its effects. It is fed by the dynamo, and it imparts its power\r\nto the machinery which it is to set in motion. It is to the dynamo\r\nwhat the water-wheel is to the water. In one sense it is an even older\r\ninvention than the dynamo, but its extended commercial application was\r\nnot possible until the dynamo had reached certain stages of perfection.\r\nIt is generally agreed that the first motor of importance was that\r\nconstructed by Professor Jacobi, through the liberality of the Czar\r\nNicholas, of Russia. Jacobi used two sets of electro-magnets, by\r\nmeans of whose mutual attraction and repulsion he rotated a wheel on\r\na boat with a power equal to that of eight oarsmen. But as Jacobi’s\r\nelectro-magnets required an electric current to magnetize them, and as\r\nthere were then no means of producing such current except by the costly\r\nuse of the voltaic battery, his invention was unripe as to time.\r\n\r\nIn 1850, Professor Page, of the Smithsonian Institution, constructed\r\na motor which worked ingeniously, but was still open to the\r\nobjection of cost in supplying the necessary electric current for\r\nthe electro-magnets. Though various inventions came about having\r\nfor their object a commercially successful motor, such a thing was\r\nimpossible till Gramme produced his improved and effective dynamo\r\nin 1871. This dynamo was found to work equally well as a motor, and\r\nhence it became necessary for electricians to greatly enlarge their\r\nunderstanding of the nature of electro-magnetic induction. They soon\r\ndiscovered many curious things respecting the behavior of induced\r\ncurrents, with the result that rapid and simultaneous improvements\r\nwere made in both dynamos and motors. One of the most curious of these\r\ndiscoveries was that a motor automatically regulates the amount of\r\ncurrent that passes through its circuit in proportion to the work it\r\nis called upon to do; that is, if the work the machine has to do is\r\ndecreased, the motor attains a higher speed, which higher speed induces\r\na counter electro-motive force sufficient to check up the amount of\r\ncurrent passing through the motor. So when the motor is required to do\r\nincreased work, the machine slows up; but with this slowing up, the\r\ncounter electro-motive force decreases, and consequently the current\r\npassing through the motor increases.\r\n\r\nAs with the dynamo, one of the marvels of the motor is its efficiency.\r\nIn perfect machines, ninety to ninety-five per cent of the electrical\r\nenergy supplied can be converted into mechanical energy. For this\r\nreason it has become a competitor with, and even successor of, steam\r\nin countless cases, and especially where water-power can be commanded.\r\nA prime motor, in the shape of a water-wheel, may be made to drive\r\nscores of secondary motors in places hundreds of miles away. The power\r\ndeveloped by the waterfall at Lauffen, Germany, is transmitted one\r\nhundred miles to Frankfort, with a loss of only twenty-five per cent of\r\nthe original horse-power.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GOLDEN CANDLESTICK.]\r\n\r\nIn its adaptation for practical use, the motor, like the dynamo,\r\nassumes all sizes and embraces a host of ingenious devices, yet its\r\npower and usefulness always centre around, or are contained in, its two\r\nefficient parts, its armatures and fields of force. We have seen how\r\nin the dynamo the armatures became the source of induced currents by\r\nbeing made to cut the fields of force of electro-magnets. Now, a dynamo\r\ncan be made to work in an opposite way; that is, by making the magnetic\r\nfields of force rotate in front of the coils or armatures. In the\r\nmotor, the field of force is mostly established by the current directly\r\nfrom the dynamo. This current passes also through the armature, which\r\nbegins to rotate, owing to the force of the field upon it. This\r\nrotation of the armature through the field of force produces in the\r\narmature conductors an electro-motive force, which is the measure of\r\nthe power of the motor, be the same great or small.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. “AND THERE WAS LIGHT.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANCIENT LAMP.]\r\n\r\nMention of the “candlestick of pure gold” (Ex. xxv. 31) may lead to the\r\ninference that the primitive artificial light was that of the candle.\r\nBut “candlestick” in connection with the lighting of the temple is\r\nclearly a misnomer. The lamp was the original artificial light-giver,\r\nunless we choose to except the torch; and if less indispensable than\r\nin patriarchal times, it is still a favorite dispenser of nightly\r\ncheer. Prior to the middle of the eighteenth century, the lamp had\r\npractically no evolution. It was the same in principle at that date as\r\nwhen it illuminated the desert tabernacle. Even the splendid enameled\r\nglass or decorated Persian pottery lamps of Damascus and Cairo, and the\r\nmagnificent brass or bronze lamps of Greece, Rome, and the European\r\ncathedrals, gave forth their dull, unsteady flame and noisome smoke\r\nby means of a crude wick lying in a saucer or similar receptacle of\r\nmelted lard, tallow, oil, or some such combustible liquid. A prime\r\nimprovement was made in lamp-lighting in 1783, by Leger, of Paris, who\r\ndevised the flat, metallic burner, through which he passed a neatly\r\nprepared wick. A further improvement was made in 1784 by Argand, of\r\nParis, who introduced a burner consisting of two circular tubes,\r\nbetween which passed a circular wick. The inner tube was perforated\r\nso as to admit of a draught of air to feed the flame on the inside of\r\nthe wick. In order to similarly feed the flame on the outside of the\r\nwick, he invented the lamp chimney, which was at first a crude thing of\r\nmetal. It, however, soon gave way to the glass chimney, which has up\r\nto the present taken on many improved forms, designed to secure more\r\nperfect combustion and a brighter, steadier glow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TALLOW DIP.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MODERN LAMP.]\r\n\r\nImprovement in lamp-lighting during the nineteenth century has\r\nconsisted of an indefinite number of inventions, all aiming at economy,\r\nbrilliancy, steadiness, convenience, beauty, and so on. But in no\r\nrespect has this improvement been more rapid and radical than in the\r\nadaptation of lamps to the various combustible fluids that have bid\r\nfor favor. While the various oils, animal and vegetable, were almost\r\nsolely in vogue as illuminants at the beginning of the century, they\r\nwere largely superseded at a later period by the burning-fluid known\r\nas camphene. This was a purified oil of turpentine, which found\r\ngreat favor on account of its economy, convenience, cleanliness, and\r\nbrilliancy of light. But it was very volatile, and its vapors formed\r\nwith air a dangerously explosive mixture. Yet with all this it might\r\nhave held its own for a long time, had not Gesner, in 1846, discovered\r\nthat a superior mineral oil, which he called “kerosene,” could be\r\nreadily and profitably distilled from the coal found on Prince Edward\r\nIsland. This kerosene or hydrocarbon oil speedily displaced camphene\r\nas an illuminant. Its manufacture rapidly developed into an important\r\nindustry in the United States, and large distilling establishments\r\narose, both on the Atlantic coast, where foreign coal was used, and\r\nthroughout the country, wherever cannel or other convertible coal\r\nwas found. With the discovery of petroleum in paying quantities on\r\nOil Creek, Pa., in 1859, there came about a great change in kerosene\r\nlamp-lighting. It was found, upon analysis, that crude petroleum\r\ncontained about fifty-five per cent of kerosene, which constituted its\r\nmost important product. The manufactories of kerosene from cannel or\r\nother coal, therefore, went out of existence, and new ones, larger in\r\nsize and greater in number, sprung up for the manufacture of kerosene\r\nor, popularly speaking, coal oil, from petroleum. This illuminant\r\ncame into almost universal favor for lamp use, owing to its cheapness\r\nand brilliancy. It is not free from danger when improperly distilled,\r\nbut under the operation of stringent laws governing its preparation\r\nand testing, danger from its use has been reduced to a minimum. In\r\nrural districts, in smaller towns and villages, wherever economy\r\nand convenience are essentials, and when beauty in lamp effects is\r\ndesirable, the kerosene illuminant has become indispensable.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of petroleum helped further to light the world and\r\ndistinguish the century. It gave us gasolene, naphtha, gas oil,\r\nastral oil, and the very effective “mineral sperm,” which is almost\r\nuniversally used in lighthouses and as headlights for locomotives. With\r\nthe addition of kerosene, a favorite light of the beginning of the\r\ncentury—the tallow dip of our grandmothers—began to fall into disuse.\r\nThe homelike pictures of housewives at their annual candle-dippings,\r\nor in the manipulation of their moulds, became venerable antiques.\r\nCandle-light paled in the presence of the higher illuminants. Though\r\nstill a convenient light under certain circumstances, it plays a\r\ngradually diminishing part amid its superiors.\r\n\r\nOne of the signal triumphs of the century has been the introduction of\r\ngas-lighting. Though illuminating gas made from coal was known as early\r\nas 1691, it did not come into use, except for experiments or in a very\r\nspecial way, until the beginning of the nineteenth century. In 1809, a\r\nfew street lamps were lit with gas in London. An unsuccessful attempt\r\nwas made to introduce gas into Baltimore in 1821. Between 1822 and\r\n1827, the gas-light began to have a feeble foothold in Boston and New\r\nYork. Other cities began to introduce it as an illuminant in streets\r\nand, eventually, in houses. But the process was very slow, owing to\r\nintense opposition on the part of both savants and common people, who\r\nsaw in it a sure means of destruction by poison, explosion, or fire. It\r\nwas not much before the middle of the century that prejudice against\r\nilluminating gas was sufficiently allayed to admit of its general\r\nuse. But meanwhile many valuable experiments as to its production and\r\nadaptation were going on. The most productive source of illuminating\r\ngas was found to be bituminous coal. Though gas could be produced by\r\ndistillation from other substances, such as shale, lignite, petroleum,\r\nwater, turf, resins, oils, and fats, none could compete in quality,\r\nquantity, and economy with what is known as ordinary coal gas, at\r\nleast, not until the time came, quite late in the century, when it was\r\nfound that non-luminous gases, such as water gas, could be rendered\r\nluminous by impregnating them with hydrocarbon vapor. This became known\r\ncommercially as water gas, and it is now largely used in place of coal\r\ngas, because it is cheaper and, for the most part, equally effective as\r\na luminant.\r\n\r\nGas-lighting has, of course, its limitations. It is not adapted for use\r\nbeyond the range of cities or towns whose populations are sufficient\r\nto warrant the large expenditures necessary for gas plants. It is a\r\nspecial rather than general light. Yet within its limited domain of use\r\nit has proved of wonderful utility,—a source of cheer for millions, a\r\nclean, safe, and economic light, a convenience far beyond the candle,\r\nthe lamp, or any previous lighting appliance. In the street, it is a\r\nsource of safety against thieves and way-layers. In the slums, it is\r\nboth policeman and missionary, baffling the wrong-doer, exposing the\r\nsecrecy that conduces to crime, laying bare the hotbeds of shame. It\r\nis as well a source of heat as light, and consequently convertible into\r\npower for light mechanical purposes. In the kitchen, it is more and\r\nmore becoming a boon to the housewife, who by means of the gas range\r\nescapes, in cooking, much of the dust, smoke, worry, and even expense\r\nof the coal cook stove and range. In the parlor, library, or sick-room,\r\nit is a cheerful and effective substitute for the coal grate, and\r\nmay be made to assume the cosy qualities and fantastic shapes of the\r\nold-fashioned wood fire. Coincident with the discovery of petroleum,\r\nits inseparable companion, natural gas, came into prominence as a\r\nsource of both light and heat, or this became true, at least, after it\r\nwas ascertained that natural gas regions existed which could be tapped\r\nby wells, and made to give forth their gaseous product independent of\r\nthe oil that may have at one time existed near or in connection with\r\nit. This natural source of light and heat became as interesting to the\r\ngeologist, explorer, and capitalist as the source of petroleum itself,\r\nand soon every likely section was prospected, with the hope of finding\r\nand tapping those mysterious caverns of earth in which the pent-up\r\nluminant abounded in paying quantities. It was found that workable\r\nnatural gas regions were numerous in the United States, especially in\r\nproximity to petroleum or bituminous coal deposits, and little time\r\nwas lost in their development. As if by magic, a new and profitable\r\nindustry sprang into existence. The natural gas well became almost\r\nas common as the oil well, and at times far more awe-inspiring as\r\nit shot into space its volcanic blasts which, when ignited through\r\ncarelessness, as sometimes happened, carried to the vicinage all the\r\ndangers and terrors of Vesuvius or Stromboli. Powerful as was the\r\nforce with which natural gas sought its freedom, wonderful as was\r\nthe phenomenon of its escape from the subterranean alembic in which\r\nit was distilled, human genius quickly harnessed it by appliances\r\nfor conservation and carriage to places where it could be utilized.\r\nSometimes great industries sprang up contiguous to the wells; at\r\nothers, it was carried through pipes to cities many miles distant,\r\nwhere it became a light for street, home, and store, and a prodigious\r\nenergy in factory, furnace, forge, and rolling-mill. In fact, no marvel\r\nof the century has been at once so weird and inscrutable in its origin\r\nas natural gas, or more potential as an agency within the areas to\r\nwhich its use is limited. The question is ever uppermost in connection\r\nwith natural gas, will it last? The gas springs of the Caucasus\r\nMountains have been burning for centuries. But that is where nature’s\r\ninternal forces have their correlations and compensations. Where it is\r\nquite otherwise, that is, where the vents of natural gas reservoirs\r\nare abnormally numerous, or where those reservoirs are drained to the\r\nextreme for commercial purposes, not to say through sheer wastefulness,\r\nthe geologist is ready to surmise that the natural gas supply cannot be\r\na perpetual one.\r\n\r\nBut one of the most magnificent triumphs of the century in the matter\r\nof light came about through the agency of electricity. We have already\r\nseen the beginnings of electric lighting in the discovery of Sir\r\nHumphrey Davy, in 1809, that when the ends of two conducting wires,\r\nmounted with charcoal pieces, were brought close together, a brilliant\r\nlight, in the shape of an arc or curve, leaped from one piece of\r\ncharcoal to the other. Davy’s charcoal pieces or carbons were consumed\r\nby the fierce heat evolved; but the principle was established that an\r\nelectric current, so interrupted, was a vivid light-producer, and\r\nmight be made permanently so if a substance capable of resisting the\r\nheat could be substituted for his charcoal tips, and a generator of\r\nelectricity of sufficient power and economy in use could be substituted\r\nfor his voltaic batteries or cells.\r\n\r\nUpon these two essentials hung the future of the electric light. The\r\nfirst essential, that of a substance at the ends of the wires or in the\r\nmidst of the electric circuit which would resist the heat, was soon met\r\nby the use of specially prepared and hard graphite carbon tips, in the\r\nshape of candles. But the second essential, a generator of electricity\r\ncheaper and more powerful than the voltaic cell, was not met with till\r\nthe dynamo machine reached an advanced stage of perfection; that is,\r\nabout 1867.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELECTRIC ARC LIGHT.]\r\n\r\nThe two grand essentials now being at command, invention of electric\r\nlight appliances went on rapidly upon two lines, eventuating in two\r\nsystems, which became known as arc lighting and incandescent lighting.\r\nBy 1879–80, the arc light was sufficiently advanced to meet with\r\nfavor as an illuminant for streets, railway stations, markets, and\r\nany large spaces, in which places it became a substitute for gas and\r\nother lights. The essential features of the arc light are: (1.) The\r\ndynamo machine, situated in some central place, for the generation of\r\nelectricity. (2.) Conducting wires to carry the electricity throughout\r\nthe areas or to the places to be lighted. (3.) The arc lamp, which\r\nmay be suspended upon poles in the streets, or upon wires in stores\r\nand other covered places. Its mechanism consists of two pencils or\r\ncandles of graphite carbon, very hard and incombustible, adjusted\r\nabove and below each other so that their tips or ends are very close\r\ntogether, but not in contact. By means of a clockwork or simple gravity\r\ndevice these carbon tips are brought into contact at the moment the\r\nelectric current is turned on, and then are slightly separated as\r\nsoon as the current has heated them. The air between the heated tips,\r\nhaving also reached a high temperature, becomes a conductor, and the\r\nelectricity leaps in the form of an arc or curve through it, rendering\r\nit brilliantly incandescent. Should the current be diminished in\r\nstrength for any reason, the above-mentioned clockwork or gravity\r\ndevice brings the carbons a little closer together; and should the\r\ncurrent be increased, the carbons are separated a little wider; thus\r\nthe steadiness of the light is regulated. There are also various\r\nautomatic devices for thus regulating the proximity of the carbons\r\nand maintaining the evenness of the glow. The power of an arc light\r\nis measured by candles. An ordinary arc light under two amperes of\r\ncurrent gives a light equal to twenty-five candles, while under fifty\r\namperes of current it gives a light equal to twenty thousand candles.\r\nIn searchlights on board vessels, and where very large areas are to\r\nbe lighted, both heavier currents and larger carbons are used than\r\nin the arc lamps for ordinary street purposes. No light surpasses\r\nthe arc light in brilliancy, excepting the magnesium light. There are\r\nfew cities in this country and Europe that do not employ the arc lamp\r\nas a means of street, station, and large-area lighting, owing to its\r\nsuperiority as an illuminant and the wonderful policing effect it has\r\nupon the slum sections.\r\n\r\nThe incandescent lamp, or electric lighting by incandescence, underwent\r\na somewhat longer evolution at the hands of inventors than the arc\r\nlamp, owing to the difficulty of finding a substance suitable for the\r\nproduction of the necessary glow. The discovery of such substance may\r\nbe accredited to Edison more fully than to any other. The incandescent\r\nor glow lamp is a glass bulb from which the air is exhausted. There\r\npasses into the bulb a filament of carbon, which, after a turn or two\r\ninside the bulb, passes out at the end through which it entered. When\r\na current from a voltaic battery is sent through this carbon filament,\r\nit brings it, in the absence of oxygen within the bulb, to a high white\r\nheat without combustion. The portion of this high white heat which is\r\nradiated is the light-giving energy of the incandescent lamp. Metal\r\nfilaments were at first tried in the bulb, but they quickly burned\r\nout. Carbon filaments were at length found to be the only ones capable\r\nof resisting the heat. They moreover had the advantage of cheapness,\r\nand of greater radiating energy than metals. Many substances, such as\r\nsilk, cotton, hair, etc., were used in the preparation of the carbon\r\nfilaments, but it was found that strips cut from the inside bark of the\r\nbamboo gave, when brought to a white heat by an electric current and\r\nthen properly treated, the most tenacious and best conducting carbon\r\nfilament.\r\n\r\nThe quality of light produced by an incandescent lamp is a gentler glow\r\nthan that produced by the arc lamp, and in color more nearly resembles\r\nthe light of gas or the oil lamp. The incandescent light speedily\r\nbecame for the home, hotel, hall, and limited covered area what the arc\r\nlight became for the street and railway station, and, if anything, the\r\nformer outstripped the latter in the extent and value of the industry\r\nit gave rise to.\r\n\r\nIn the arc lamp, the carbon pencils have to be renewed daily. In the\r\nincandescent lamp, the carbon filament, though very delicate, may last\r\nfor quite a time, because incandescence takes place in the absence\r\nof oxygen. If the favor in which the electric light is held, and the\r\ngreat extent of its use, rested solely on the question of cheapness of\r\nproduction, such question would give rise to interesting debate. And,\r\nindeed, the debate would continue, if the question were the superior\r\nfitness of electric lighting for lighthouses and like service, where\r\nextreme brilliancy does not seem to penetrate a thick atmosphere as\r\neffectively as the more subdued glow of the oil lamp. But the debate\r\nceases when the question is as to the beauty and efficiency of the\r\nelectric light in the home, street, station, mine, on shipboard, and\r\nthe thousand and one other places in which it has come to be deemed\r\nan essential equipment. In all such places the question of economy of\r\nproduction and use is subordinate to the higher question of utility and\r\nindispensability.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. ELECTRIC LOCOMOTION.\r\n\r\nThe dawn of the nineteenth century saw, as vehicles of locomotion,\r\nthe saddled hackney, the clumsy wagon, the ostentatious stage-coach,\r\nthe primitive dearborn, the lumbering carriage, the poetic “one-hoss\r\nshay.” The universal energy was the horse. A new energy came with the\r\napplication of steam, and with it new vehicular locomotion,—easier,\r\nswifter, stronger, for the most part cheaper, rendering possible what\r\nwas hitherto impossible as to time and distance.\r\n\r\nThis signal triumph of the century may not have been eclipsed by\r\nthe introduction of subsequent locomotive changes, but it was to be\r\nsupplemented by what, at the beginning, would have passed for the\r\nidle dream of a visionary. The horse-car came, had its brief day, and\r\nwent out with all its inconveniences, cruelties, and horrors before,\r\nin part, the traction-car, and, in part, the rapidly revolutionizing\r\nenergy of electricity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVE.]\r\n\r\nThe first conception of a railway to be operated by electricity dates\r\nfrom about 1835, when Thomas Davenport, of Brandon, Vt., contrived\r\nand moved a small car by means of a current from voltaic cells placed\r\nwithin it. In 1851, Professor Page, of the Smithsonian Institution,\r\nran a car propelled by electricity upon the steam railway between\r\nWashington and Baltimore, but though he obtained a high rate of speed,\r\nthe cost of supplying the current by means of batteries—the only means\r\nthen known—prohibited the commercial use of his method.\r\n\r\nWith the invention of the dynamo as an economic and powerful generator\r\nof electricity, and also the invention of the motor as a means of\r\nturning electrical energy to mechanical account, the way was open,\r\nboth in the United States and Europe, for more active investigation\r\nof the question of electric-car propulsion. Between 1872 and 1887,\r\ndifferent inventors, at home and abroad, placed in operation several\r\nexperimental electric railways. Few of them proved practical, though\r\neach furnished a fund of valuable experience. An underground electric\r\nstreet railway was operated in Denver as early as 1885; but the one\r\nupon the trolley plan, which proved sufficiently successful to warrant\r\nits being called the first operated in the United States, was built\r\nin Richmond, Va., in 1888. It gave such impetus to electric railway\r\nconstruction that, in five years’ time, enormous capital was embarked,\r\nand the new means of propulsion was generally accepted as convenient,\r\nsafe, and profitable.\r\n\r\nThe essential features of the electric railway are: (1.) The track of\r\ntwo rails, similar to the steam railway, (2.) The cars, lightly yet\r\nstrongly built. (3.) The power-house, containing the dynamos which\r\ngenerate the electricity. (4.) The feed-wire, usually of stout copper,\r\nrunning the length of the tracks of the system, and supported on\r\npoles or laid in conduits. (5.) The trolley-wire over the centre of\r\nthe track, supported by insulated cross-wires passing from poles on\r\nopposite sides of the tracks, and connected at proper intervals with\r\nthe feed-wire. (6.) The trolley-pole of metal jointed to the top of\r\nthe car, and fitted with a spring which presses the wheel on the end\r\nof the pole up against the trolley-wire with a force of about fifteen\r\npounds, and which also serves to conduct the electricity down through\r\nthe car to the motor. (7.) The motor, which is suspended from the car\r\ntruck, and passes its power to the car axle by means of a spur gearing.\r\nThe power requisite for an ordinary trolley-car is about fifteen\r\nhorse-power. The speed of trolley-cars is regulated in cities to from\r\nfive to seven miles per hour, but they may be run, under favorable\r\nconditions, at a speed equal to, or in excess of, that of the steam-car.\r\n\r\nAs a means of city transit, and of rapid, convenient, and economic\r\nintercourse between suburban localities and rural towns and villages,\r\nthe electric traction system ranks as one of the greatest wonders of\r\nthe century. The speed with which it found favor, the enormous capital\r\nit provoked to activity, the stimulus it gave to further study and\r\ninvention, the surprising number of passengers carried, go to make\r\none of the most interesting chapters in electric annals. The end of\r\nthe century sees thousands of these electric roads in existence; a\r\ncomparatively new industry involving over $100,000,000; a passenger\r\ntraffic running into the billions of people; a prospect that the\r\ntrolley will succeed the steam-car for all utilizable purposes within\r\nthe gradually extending influence of cities and towns upon their rural\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the passing of the horse-car and its substitution by\r\nthe trolley, a distinguished writer has well said: “Humanity in an\r\nelectric-car differs widely from that in the horse-car, propelled\r\nat the expense of animal life. It is more cheerful, more confident,\r\nmore awake to the energy at command, more imbued with the subtlety\r\nand majesty of the propelling force. The motor confirms the ethical\r\nfact that each introduction of a higher material force into the daily\r\nuses of humanity lifts it to a broader, brighter plane, gives its\r\ncapabilities freer and more wholesome play, and opens fresh vistas for\r\nall possibilities. We applaud Franklin for seizing the lightning in\r\nthe heavens, dragging it down to earth, and subjugating it to man. Let\r\nthis pass as part of the poetry of physics. But when ethics comes to\r\npoetize, let it be said that electricity as an applied force lifts man\r\nup toward heaven, quickens all his appreciations of divine energy,\r\ndraws him irresistibly toward the centre and source of nature’s forces.\r\nThere is no dragging down and subjugation of a physical force. There\r\nis only a going out, or up, of genius to meet and to grasp it. Its\r\nuniversal application means the raising of mankind to its plane. If\r\nelectricity be the principle of life, as some suppose, what wonder that\r\nwe all feel better in an electric-car than any other? The motor becomes\r\na sublime motive. God himself is tugging at the wheels, and we are\r\nriding with the Infinite.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELECTRIC RAILWAY. THIRD RAIL SYSTEM.]\r\n\r\nEnthusiasts say the trolley is only the beginning of electric\r\nlocomotion, and that there is already in rapid evolution an electric\r\nsystem which will supersede steam even for trunk-line purposes. In\r\nvision, it presumes a speed of one hundred and twenty-five miles an\r\nhour instead of forty; greater safety, cleanliness, and comfort; and\r\nwhat is most momentous and startling, an economy in construction and\r\noperation which will warrant the sacrifice of the billions of dollars\r\nnow invested in steam-railway properties. The proposition is not to\r\nsacrifice the steam-railway track, but to add to it a third rail, which\r\nis to carry the electric current. Then, by means of feed-conduits\r\nalongside of the track, and specially constructed electric locomotives\r\nand cars, the system is supposed to reach the practical perfection\r\nclaimed for it. Experiments with such an electrical system, made upon\r\nbranch lines of some of our trunk-line railways, as the Pennsylvania,\r\nNew York Central, and New Haven & Hartford, give much encouragement to\r\nthe hypothesis that it may become the next great step in the evolution\r\nof electrical science.\r\n\r\nAnother means of electric propulsion was provided by the investigations\r\nof Planté, which resulted in his invention of the “accumulator” or\r\n“storage battery,” in 1859. His battery consists of plates of lead\r\nimmersed in dilute sulphuric acid. By the passage of an electric\r\ncurrent through the acid, it is electrolytically decomposed. By\r\ncontinuing the current for a time, first in one direction and then in\r\nanother, the lead plates become changed, the one at the point where\r\nthe current leaves the cell taking on a deposit of spongy lead, and\r\nthe one at the point where the current enters the cell taking on a\r\ncoating of oxide of lead. When in this condition, the battery is said\r\nto be stored, and is capable of sending out an electric current in any\r\ncircuit with which it may be connected. After exhausting itself, it can\r\nbe re-stored or re-charged in the same way as at first. Faure greatly\r\nimproved on Planté’s storage battery in 1880, by spreading the oxide\r\nof lead over the plates, thus greatly reducing the time in forming the\r\nplates. Subsequently, further improvements were made, till batteries\r\ncame into existence capable of supplying a current of many hundred\r\namperes for several hours. One of the first practical uses to which the\r\nstorage battery was put was in the propulsion of street-cars; but its\r\nweight proved a drawback. It was found better adapted for the running\r\nof boats on rivers, and, in the business of water-freightage for short\r\ndistances, has in many instances become a rival of steam. It found one\r\nof its most interesting applications in helping to solve the problem\r\nof the _automobile_, or “horseless carriage,” either for pleasure\r\npurposes or for street traffic. In this problem it has, at the end of\r\nthe century, an active rival in compressed air; but as the “horseless\r\ncarriage” is rapidly coming into demand, means may soon be found to\r\nutilize the strong and persistent energy of the storage battery,\r\nwithout the drawback found in its great weight.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. THE X RAY.\r\n\r\nAn astounding electrical revelation came during the last years of the\r\ncentury through the discovery of the X, or unknown, or Roentgen ray. A\r\nhint of this discovery was given by Faraday during his investigation\r\nof the effect of electric discharges within rarefied gases. He also\r\ninvented the terms _anode_ and _cathode_, both of which are in\r\nuniversal use in connection with instruments for producing the X rays;\r\nthe anode being the positive pole or electrode of a galvanic battery,\r\nor, in general, the terminal of the conductor by which a current enters\r\nan electrolytic cell; and the cathode being the negative pole or\r\nelectrode by which a current leaves said cell.\r\n\r\nGeissler followed Faraday with an improved system of tubes for\r\ncontaining rarefied gases for experimentation. He partially exhausted\r\nhis tubes of air, introduced into them permanent and sealed platinum\r\nelectrodes, and produced those wonderful effects by the discharge\r\nobtained by connecting the electrodes with the terminals of an electric\r\nmachine or induction coil, which from their novelty and beauty became\r\nknown as Geissler effects, just as his tubes became known as Geissler\r\ntubes. In the attenuated atmosphere of the Geissler tube, the current\r\ndoes not pass directly from one platinum point or electrode to the\r\nother, but, instead, illuminates the entire atmospheric space. When\r\nother gases are introduced in rarefied form, they are similarly\r\nilluminated, but in colors corresponding to their composition. In his\r\nfurther experiments, Geissler noted that the gases in the tube behaved\r\ndifferently at the anode, or positive terminal, and the cathode, or\r\nnegative terminal. A beautiful bluish light appeared at the cathode,\r\nwhile the anode assumed the same color as the illuminated space in the\r\ntube. It was also noted that after the electric discharge within the\r\ntube, there remained upon the inner surface of the glass a fluorescent\r\nor phosphorescent glow, which was attributed to the effect of the\r\ncathode.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEISSLER’S TUBES.]\r\n\r\nThis brought the study of the _cathode_ rays into prominence, and\r\nthrough the investigations of Professor William Crookes, in 1879 and\r\nafterwards, a conclusion was reached that a “Fourth State of Matter”\r\nreally existed. He perfected tubes of very high vacuum, by means of\r\nwhich he showed that molecules of gas projected from the cathode moved\r\nfreely and with great velocity among one another, and so bombarded the\r\ninner walls of the tube as to render it fluorescent.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, Hertz showed that the cathodic rays would penetrate thin\r\nsheets of metal placed within the tube or bulb; and soon after, Paul\r\nLenard (1894) demonstrated that the cathodic ray could be investigated\r\nas well outside of the tube or bulb as within it. He set an aluminum\r\nplate in the glass wall of the bulb opposite the cathode. Though\r\nordinary light could not penetrate the aluminum plate, it was readily\r\npierced by the cathodic rays, to a distance of three inches beyond its\r\noutside surface. With these rays, thus freed from their inclosure, he\r\nproduced the same fluorescent effects as had been noted within the\r\nbulb, and even secured some photographic effects. These cathodic rays\r\nproduced no effect on the eye, which proved their dissimilarity to\r\nlight. Lenard showed further that the cathodic rays outside of the tube\r\ncould be deflected from their straight course by a magnet, that they\r\nmight pass through substances opaque to light, and that in so passing\r\nthey might cast a shadow of objects less opaque, which shadow could be\r\nphotographed. Now Professor Roentgen came upon the scene. He had been\r\nconducting his experiments in Germany, along the same lines as Lenard,\r\nand had reached practically the same results as to the penetrative,\r\nfluorescent, and photographic effects of the cathodic rays. But he\r\nhad gone still further, and, in 1896, fairly set the scientific world\r\naflame with the announcement that all the effects produced by Lenard\r\nin the limited space of a few inches could also be produced at long\r\ndistances from the tube, and with sufficient intensity to depict solid\r\nsubstances within or behind other substances sufficiently solid to\r\nbe impermeable by light. Professor Roentgen claims that his X ray is\r\ndifferent from the cathodic ray of Lenard and others, because it cannot\r\nbe deflected by a magnet. This claim has given rise to much controversy\r\nrespecting the real nature of the X ray, a controversy not likely to\r\nend soon, yet one full of inspiration to further investigation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCIAGRAPH OR SHADOW PICTURE.\r\n\r\nBy X Ray process.]\r\n\r\nThe essential features of the best approved apparatus designed to\r\nproduce the X ray and to secure a photograph of an invisible object,\r\nare: (1.) A battery or light dynamo as a generator of the electric\r\ncurrent, accompanied, of course, by the necessary induction coil,\r\nwhich should be so wound as to give a spark of at least two inches in\r\nlength in the tube where a picture of a simple object, as a coin in\r\na purse, is desired; a spark of four inches in length where pictures\r\nof the bones of the hands, feet, or arms are desired; and a spark of\r\nfrom eight to ten inches in length where inside views of the chest,\r\nthighs, or abdomen are desired. (2.) The second essential is the glass\r\ntube. The one in common use is the Crookes tube, usually pear-shaped,\r\nand resting upon a stand. Into it is inserted two aluminum electrodes\r\nor disks, the one through the smaller end of the tube being used as\r\nthe cathode, and the one from below and near the large end being used\r\nas the anode. (3.) A fluoroscope with which to observe the conditions\r\ninside the tube necessary to the production of the X ray, to decide\r\nupon its proper intensity, and to establish the proper degree of\r\nfluorescence. The favorite fluoroscope for this purpose is the one\r\ninvented by Edison. It is in the form of a stereopticon, in which\r\nis a dark chamber after the manner of a camera. In front are two\r\nopenings, admitting of a view within of both eyes. At the opposite,\r\nand greatly enlarged, end is a screen which is rendered fluorescent\r\nby means of a new substance (tungstate of calcium) discovered by Mr.\r\nEdison after some eighteen hundred experiments. Such is the power of\r\nthis fluoroscope that it may be used as an independent instrument in\r\ncases of minor surgery to locate bullets or other objects buried in the\r\nflesh, even before a photograph has been taken. (4.) The photographic\r\nplate, which is prepared with a sensitized film and mounted in a\r\nframe as in ordinary photography. Upon this film the object to be\r\nphotographed is laid, say, for instance, the human hand, care being\r\ntaken to have the film or plate at a proper distance from the Crookes\r\ntube. Current is now turned into the tube, the X ray is developed, the\r\nfilm is exposed to its effects, and the result is a negative showing\r\nthe interior structure of the hand,—the bones or any foreign object\r\ntherein. This negative is developed as in ordinary photography.\r\n\r\nThe discovery and application of the X ray has proved of immense value\r\nin medicine and surgery. By its means the physician is enabled to\r\ncarry on far-reaching diagnoses, and to ascertain with certainty the\r\nwhole internal structure of the human body. Fractures, dislocations,\r\ndeformities, and diseases of the bones may be located and their\r\ncharacter and treatment decided upon. In dentistry, the teeth may\r\nbe photographed by means of the X ray, even before they come to the\r\nsurface, and broken fangs and hidden fillings may be located. Foreign\r\nobjects in the body, as bullets, needles, calculi in the bladder,\r\netc., may be localized, and the surgery necessary for their safe\r\nremoval greatly simplified. The beating of the heart, movement of the\r\nribs in respiration, and outline of the liver may be exhibited to the\r\neye. It has been boldly suggested that in the X ray will be found an\r\nagent capable of destroying the various bacilli which infest the human\r\nsystem, and become germs of such destructive diseases as cholera,\r\nyellow fever, typhoid fever, diphtheria, and consumption. Even if this\r\nbe speculative as yet, there is still room for marvel at the actual\r\nresults of the discovery of the X ray, and its future study opens a\r\nfield full of the grandest possibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. OTHER ELECTRICAL WONDERS.\r\n\r\nThe novel idea of keeping time by means of electricity originated\r\nquite early in the century, and culminated in two kinds of electric\r\nclocks, one moved directly by the electric current, the other moved\r\nby weights or springs, but regulated by electricity. The former have\r\nthe advantage of running a very long time without attention, but as\r\nit is impossible to keep up an unvarying electric current, they are\r\nnot so accurate as the latter in keeping time. Though the latter are\r\npopularly called electric clocks, they are really only clocks regulated\r\nby electricity, and in such regulation the electric current comes to\r\nbe a most important agent, as is proved at all centres of astronomical\r\nand other observations, as at Greenwich and Washington. At such centres\r\nthe astronomical time-keeper is set up so as to run as infallibly as\r\npossible. This central time-keeper, say at Washington, is electrically\r\nconnected with other clocks, at observatories, signal-service stations,\r\nrailway stations, clock-stores, city halls, etc., throughout the\r\ncountry. Should any of these clocks lose or gain the minutest fraction\r\nof time as compared with that of the central time-keeper, the electric\r\ncurrent corrects such loss or gain, and so keeps all the clocks at a\r\ntime uniform with one another and with the central one. Electrical\r\ndevices are also often attached to individual clocks, as those upon\r\ncity hall towers and in exposed places, for the purpose of meeting\r\nand correcting inequalities of time occasioned by weather exposure,\r\nexpansion and contraction by heat and cold, etc.\r\n\r\nThe fatherhood of the very useful and elegant arts of electrotyping\r\nand electroplating is in dispute. Daniell, while perfecting his\r\nbattery, noticed that a current of electricity would cause a deposit\r\nof copper. In 1831, Jacobi, of St. Petersburg, called attention to the\r\nfact that the copper deposited on his plates of copper by galvanic\r\naction could be removed in a perfect sheet, which presented in relief,\r\nand most accurately, every accidental indentation on the original\r\nplates. Following this up, he employed for his battery an engraved\r\ncopper plate, caused the deposit to be formed upon it, removed the\r\ndeposit, and found that the engraving was impressed on it in relief,\r\nand with sufficient firmness and sharpness to enable him to print from\r\nit. Jacobi called his discovery galvanoplasty in the publication of\r\nhis observations in 1839. It was but a step from this discovery to\r\nthe application of the electrotyping process to the art of printing.\r\nA mould of wax, plaster, or other suitable substance is made of an\r\nengraving or of a page of type. This mould is covered with powdered\r\ngraphite (black lead) so as to make it a conductor of electricity.\r\nIt is then inserted in a bath containing a solution of sulphate of\r\ncopper. An electric current is passed through the bath, and the copper\r\nis deposited on the mould in sufficient quantity to give it a hard\r\nsurface capable of offering greater resistance in printing than the\r\ntypes themselves, and also of producing a clearer impression. In\r\nelectroplating, practically the same principle is employed. The bath is\r\nmade to contain a solution of water, cyanide of potassium, and whatever\r\nmetal—gold, silver, platinum, etc.—it is designed to precipitate on\r\nthe article to be electroplated. The current is then passed through the\r\nbath, and the article—spoon, knife, fork, etc.—to be electroplated\r\nreceives its coating of gold, silver, German silver, platinum, or\r\nwhatever has been made the third agent in the bath.\r\n\r\nThe various modern submarine devices for the destruction of ships,\r\nknown as torpedoes, submarine mines, etc., depend upon electricity for\r\ntheir efficiency. It is the lighting or firing agent, and is carried to\r\nthe torpedo or mine by means of stout wires or cables from some safe\r\nshore-point of observation.\r\n\r\nIn railroading, electricity has become an indispensable agent for\r\nthe operation of signal systems, opening and closing of switches,\r\nand limitation of safety sections. It moves the drill in the mine,\r\nsets off the blast, and supplies the light. It enables the dentist\r\nto manipulate his most delicate tools and do his cleanest and least\r\npainful work. In medicine it is a healing, soothing agent, boundless\r\nin variety of application and wondrous in results. It is a stimulus\r\nto the growth of certain plants, and has given rise to a new science\r\ncalled Electro-horticulture. It may be made a prolific source of heat\r\nfor warming cars, and even for the welding of iron and steel. The\r\nelectric fan cools our parlors and offices in summer, and the electric\r\nbell simplifies household service. In fact, it would appear that, in\r\ncontrasting the electrical beginnings with the electrical endings of\r\nthe nineteenth century, the space of a thousand rather than a hundred\r\nyears had intervened, and that in measuring the agents which conduce to\r\nhuman comfort and convenience, electricity is easily the most potential.\r\n\r\n\r\nX. ELECTRICAL LANGUAGE.\r\n\r\nOut of the various discoveries and applications of electricity almost\r\na new language has sprung. This is especially so of terms expressive\r\nof the measurements of electric energy, and of the laws governing the\r\napplication of electric power. For a time, various nations measured and\r\napplied by means of terms chosen by themselves. This led to a jargon\r\nvery confusing to writers and investigators. It became needful to have\r\na language more in common, as in pharmacy, so that all nations could\r\nunderstand one another, could compute alike, and especially impart\r\ntheir meaning to those whose duty it became to apply discovered laws\r\nand actual calculations to practical electric operations. This was a\r\ndifficult undertaking, owing to the tenacity with which nations clung\r\nto their own nomenclatures and terminologies. But the drift, though\r\nslow, finally ended at the Electrical Congress in Paris in 1881, in the\r\nadoption of a uniform system of measurements of electric force, and an\r\nagreement upon terms for laws and their application, which all could\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\nThree fundamental units of measurement were first agreed upon,—the\r\n_Centimetre_ (.394 in.) as a unit of length; the _Gramme_ (15.43\r\ntroy grains) as a unit of mass; the _Second_ (1/60 of a minute) as a\r\nunit of time. These three units became, when referred to together\r\nby their initial letters, the basis of the C. G. S. system of units.\r\nNow by these units of measurement something must be measured, as, for\r\ninstance, the electric force; and when so measured, an absolute unit of\r\nforce must be the result.\r\n\r\nDYNE:—This is but a contraction of _dynam_, force. It was adopted\r\nas the name of the “Absolute Unit of Force,” or the C. G. S. unit of\r\nforce, and is that force which, if it act for a second on one gramme of\r\nmatter, gives to it a velocity of one centimetre per second.\r\n\r\nAMPERE:—Electrical force produces electrical current. Current must\r\nbe measured and an absolute unit of current strength agreed upon. The\r\n“Absolute Unit of Current” was settled as one of such strength as that\r\nwhen one centimetre length of its circuit is bent into an arc of one\r\ncentimetre radius, the current in it exerts a force of one dyne on a\r\nunit magnet-pole placed at the centre. But the absolute unit of current\r\nas thus obtained was decided to be ten times too great for practical\r\npurposes. So a practical unit of current was fixed upon, which is just\r\none tenth part of the above absolute unit of current. This practical\r\nunit of current was called the ampere, in honor of the celebrated\r\nFrench electrician, Ampère. It may be ascertained in other ways,\r\nas when a current is of sufficient strength to deposit in a copper\r\nelectrolytic cell 1.174 grammes (18.116 grains) of copper in an hour,\r\nsuch current is said to be of one ampere strength; or a current of one\r\nampere strength is such a one as would be given by an electro-motive\r\nforce of one volt through a wire offering one ohm of resistance.\r\n\r\nVOLT:—This was named from Volta, the celebrated Italian electrician,\r\nand was agreed upon as the unit of electro-motive force. It is that\r\nelectro-motive force which would be generated by a conductor cutting\r\nacross 100,000,000 C. G. S. lines in a field of force per second; or it\r\nis that electro-motive force which would carry one ampere of current\r\nagainst one ohm of resistance.\r\n\r\nOHM:—So called from Ohm, a German electrician. It is the unit of\r\nresistance offered by a conductor to the passage of an electrical\r\ncurrent. As an absolute unit of resistance, it is equal to\r\n1,000,000,000 C. G. S. units of resistance. As a practical unit, and\r\nas agreed upon at the International Congress of Electricians (Chicago,\r\n1893), it represents the resistance offered to an electric current at\r\nthe temperature of melting ice by a column of mercury 14.451 grammes\r\nin mass, of a constant cross-sectional area, and 106.3 centimetres in\r\nlength. This is called the international ohm. The resistance offered by\r\n400 feet of ordinary telegraph wire is about an ohm.\r\n\r\nThese three units—ampere, volt, and ohm—are the factors in\r\nOhm’s famous law that the current is directly proportional to the\r\nelectro-motive force exerted in a circuit, and inversely proportional\r\nto the resistance of the circuit; that is,—\r\n\r\n  Current = Electro-motive force / Resistance\r\n\r\nor,\r\n\r\n  Electro-motive force = Current × Resistance\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n  Resistance = Electro-motive force / Current.\r\n\r\nERG:—From the Greek _ergon_, work, is the unit of work required to\r\nmove a force of one dyne one centimetre. One foot-pound equals 13,560\r\nergs.\r\n\r\nCALORIE:—Latin _calor_, heat, is the unit of heat; being the amount\r\nof heat required to raise the temperature of one kilogram of water one\r\ndegree centigrade.\r\n\r\nCOULOMB:—In honor of C. A. de Coulomb, of France. It is the practical\r\nunit of quantity in measuring electricity, and is the amount conveyed\r\nby one ampere in one second.\r\n\r\nFARAD:—From FARADAY, the physicist. It is the unit of electric\r\ncapacity, and is the capacity of a condenser that retains one coulomb\r\nof charge with one volt difference of potential.\r\n\r\nGAUSS:—From Carl F. Gauss (1785–1855). The C. G. S. unit of\r\nflux-density, or the unit by which the intensity of magnetic fields are\r\nmeasured. It equals one weber per normal square centimetre.\r\n\r\nGILBERT:—The unit for measuring magneto-motive force, being produced\r\nby .7958 ampere-turn approximately.\r\n\r\nHENRY:—From Joseph Henry, of the Smithsonian Institution, Washington,\r\nD. C. The practical unit for measuring the induction in a circuit when\r\nthe electro-motive force induced is one international volt, while the\r\ninducing current varies at the rate of one ampere per second.\r\n\r\nJOULE:—The C. G. S. unit of practical energy, being equivalent to the\r\nwork done in keeping up for one second a current of one ampere against\r\na resistance of one ohm. Named from J. P. Joule, of England.\r\n\r\nOERSTED:—From Oersted, the electrician. It is the practical unit for\r\nmeasuring electrical reluctance.\r\n\r\nWATT:—The practical electrical unit of the rate of working in a\r\ncircuit, when the electro-motive force is one volt, and the intensity\r\nof current is one ampere. It is equal to 107 ergs per second, or .00134\r\nhorse-power per second. Named from James Watt, of Scotland.\r\n\r\nWEBER:—The practical unit for measuring magnetic flux. Named from W.\r\nWeber, of Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CENTURY’S NAVAL PROGRESS\r\n\r\nBY REAR ADMIRAL GEORGE WALLACE MELVILLE, U. S. N.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. INFLUENCE OF SEA POWER.\r\n\r\nThe share of navies in the great movements which have moulded human\r\ndestiny and shaped the world’s progress, although long obscure and\r\nundervalued, has met in our time full recognition. Within a decade the\r\ninfluence of sea power upon history has become the frequent theme of\r\nhistorians and essayists who, in clear and striking form, have shown\r\nthe cardinal importance, both in war and commerce, of the fleet—the\r\nnation’s right arm on the sea. It is fitting, therefore, that in the\r\nretrospect of a hundred years navies should have their place; that, in\r\nlooking backward with history’s unclouded vision, we should mark, not\r\nonly their growth and change, but, as well, their achievement in some\r\nof the most memorable conflicts of our race.\r\n\r\nThe century had but begun when, at Copenhagen, Nelson, with one titanic\r\nblow, shattered the naval strength of Denmark and the coalition of the\r\nNorthern powers. His signal there, ever for “closer battle,” told in\r\nfew words the life story of the Great Admiral, and foreshadowed his\r\nend. Four years later, at Trafalgar, the desire of his eager heart\r\nwas satisfied, when he met in frank fight the fleets of France and\r\nSpain. Amid the thundering cannonade of that last victory his life-tide\r\nebbed, bearing with it the power of France upon the seas and the broken\r\nfortunes of Napoleon. In the war of 1812, our disasters upon the land\r\nmet compensation in victory afloat. The United States was then among\r\nthe feeblest of maritime powers; and yet Macdonough and Perry on the\r\nlakes and our few frigates on the ocean opposed, with success, the\r\nswarming squadrons of a nation whose naval glory, as Hallam says, can\r\nbe traced onward “in a continuous track of light” from the days of the\r\nCommonwealth. The oppression of the Sultan was ended for a time when,\r\nin 1827, the Turkish and Egyptian fleets were annihilated, in sudden\r\nfury, by the allied squadrons in that brief engagement which Wellington\r\ntermed the “untoward event” of Navarino.\r\n\r\nA generation later, the command of the sea enabled England and France\r\nto despatch, in unarmed transports, 63,000 men and 128 guns to the\r\nCrimea, and to land them, without opposition, for the red carnage of\r\nthe Alma, Balaklava, Inkerman, and Sebastopol. Following closely upon\r\nthe disease and death, the fatuity and the glory, of the Crimea, came\r\nthe great war of modern times, in which the gun afloat played such a\r\ngallant part, as the blockade, with its constricting coils, slowly\r\nstarved and strangled the Confederacy to death, and Farragut, on inland\r\nwaters, split it in twain. Passing over the sea-fights of Lissa,—in\r\nwhich imperial Venice was the stake,—of South America and the Yalu, we\r\nnote, lastly, the swift and fateful actions off Santiago and in Manila\r\nBay, which destroyed once again the sea power of Spain, won distant\r\nterritory for the United States, and opened up for us a noble pathway\r\nof commercial expansion to the uttermost island of the broad Pacific\r\nand the vast Asian littoral beyond. Who will say, in the retrospect of\r\nthe century, that the fleets of the world have not had their full share\r\nin the making of its history?\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE CENTURY’S GROWTH IN NAVAL STRENGTH.\r\n\r\nThe United States fleet, in the year 1800, comprised 35 vessels, 10 of\r\nwhich were frigates mounting 32 guns or more. In 1812, America entered\r\nthe lists against a navy of a thousand sail, with a fleet of but 20\r\nships, the largest of which was a 44-gun frigate. The operations of\r\nthe Civil War were begun with but 82 vessels, 48 of which were sailing\r\ncraft. Before the close of that gigantic struggle there were added,\r\nby construction or purchase, 674 steamers. In 1898, during the war\r\nwith Spain, there were borne on the Naval Register, as building or\r\nin service, 13 battleships and 176 other vessels, including torpedo\r\ncraft, with 123 converted merchantmen. The total naval force during\r\nhostilities was 22,832 men and 2382 officers, excluding the Marine\r\nCorps.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN AUGUST MORNING WITH FARRAGUT.\r\n\r\n(Battle of Mobile Bay.)]\r\n\r\nAt London, in 1653, there was printed “A List of the Commonwealth\r\nof England’s Navy at Sea, in their expedition in May, 1653, under\r\nthe command of the Right Honorable Colonel Richard Deane and Colonel\r\nGeorge Monk, Esquires, Generals, and Admirals.” This quaint record of\r\nthat early time gives the force afloat as 105 ships, 3840 guns, and\r\n16,269 men. In Britain’s strife for that ocean empire, which is world\r\nempire, that fleet had grown, by the year 1800, to 757 vessels, built\r\nor building, with an aggregate tonnage of 629,211, and carrying 26,552\r\nguns, 3653 officers, and 110,000 men. The stately three-decker, with\r\nits snowy canvas and maze of rigging, has vanished with the past; but,\r\ndespite time and change, that mighty fleet still dominates the seas.\r\nIts strength, on February 1, 1898, was 615 vessels—61 of which were\r\nbattleships,—carrying a total force of 110,050 officers and men.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRITISH BATTLESHIP MAJESTIC.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRENCH BATTLESHIP MAGENTA.]\r\n\r\nColbert, when the Grand Monarch was at the zenith of his power, found\r\nFrance with a few old and rotten vessels, and left her with a noble\r\nfleet of 40 ships of the line and 60 frigates, which, under D’Estrée,\r\nJean Bart, Tourville, and Duquesne, carried her flag to every sea.\r\nA state paper of the time gives the force at the beginning of this\r\ncentury as 61 ships of the line, 42 corvettes, and a numerous, although\r\nunimportant, flotilla of small craft. With Aboukir and Trafalgar, the\r\nmaritime power of France wasted away; and, by the year 1839, there\r\nwere afloat but three effective sail of the line. In 1840, however,\r\nthe revival began, and during the modern era the French fleet has,\r\nat times, been a formidable rival of that of England. It comprised,\r\nin 1898, 446 vessels, including torpedo craft, 26 of the total being\r\nbattleships. The force afloat numbered 70,925, of all ranks and ratings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GERMAN BATTLESHIP WOERTH.]\r\n\r\nGermany’s navy is of modern creation. It began, a little less than\r\nhalf a century ago, with one sailing corvette and two gunboats; and,\r\nin 1898, comprised 13 battleships and 179 other vessels of all types,\r\ncarrying 23,302 officers and men. The fleet of united Italy had its\r\ninception, also, within the age of steam. It was on March 17, 1860,\r\nthat Italian national life began with the ascension of the throne\r\nby Victor Emmanuel. From the beginning, the kingdom has been lavish\r\nwith its fleet, its expenditures within the first six years reaching\r\n$60,000,000. In 1898 there were in the Italian navy 265 vessels of all\r\ntypes, 17 of which were battleships. The force afloat was 24,200, of\r\nall ranks and ratings.\r\n\r\nThe Crimean war found Russia but little advanced, either on the Black\r\nSea or the Baltic, in the substitution of steam for sail. Since that\r\ntime, however, she has re-created her battle fleet, which is now\r\nespecially strong in torpedo craft and cruisers of great steaming\r\nradius. Her navy, in 1898, comprised 20 battleships and 263 other\r\nvessels, with a force of 32,477 officers and men. Japan began her fleet\r\nin 1866 with the purchase of an armor-clad from the United States. In\r\n1898, she had a total of 145 vessels, built and building—8 of which\r\nwere battleships—carrying 23,000 men of all ranks and ratings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ITALIAN BATTLESHIP SARDEGNA.]\r\n\r\nOf minor navies little need be said. Austria had, in 1898, a fleet\r\nof 115 vessels of all types, including 13 battleships and 79 torpedo\r\ncraft. Holland’s force was 185 vessels, 3 being battleships and 93\r\ntorpedo craft. The fleets of Turkey, Greece, Spain, and Portugal are\r\n“paper-navies” mainly. Norway and Sweden have a combined strength\r\nof 171 vessels of all types. Denmark, which began the century with\r\noverwhelming naval disaster at Copenhagen, has now a force of 3000\r\nmen borne on 50 vessels, half of which are torpedo craft. Argentina,\r\nBrazil, and Chili have afloat 102 torpedo vessels and 49 of other\r\ntypes. The vast growth in naval armaments during the century may be\r\nmeasured from the fact that the personnel of the leading navies of\r\nEurope, with those of Japan and the United States, comprised, in the\r\nyear 1898, 368,028 officers and men, with a total force of 2749 vessels\r\nof all types, including torpedo craft.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE BATTLESHIP,—PAST AND PRESENT.\r\n\r\nIn tracing the evolution of the modern man-of-war, it will be\r\ninstructive to compare with her the type of the sailing age. There are\r\ntwo ships of the old time which hold chief places in the memory of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon race,—the Victory, Nelson’s flagship at Trafalgar, and the\r\nConstitution, whose achievements under Hull, Bainbridge, and Stewart,\r\nrang around the world. There were, even before the days of steam,\r\nwar-vessels twice as large and powerful as “Old Ironsides,” but over no\r\nsea, in any age, has there sailed a ship with a more gallant record.\r\nPlate I shows her as she was in her prime—before the wind, with all\r\nsail set. On Plate II there is given a side view of her hull, which\r\nis of historic interest, in that it is reproduced from the original\r\ndrawing made in October, 1796.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NELSON’S FLAGSHIP VICTORY.]\r\n\r\nWhen her power and dimensions are compared with those of the Oregon,\r\nour sea-fighter of to-day, one sees what time has wrought. The frigate\r\ncarried 456 men, the armor-clad, 500; and yet, with this approximately\r\nequal force, the Oregon has a displacement 6½ times that of her famed\r\npredecessor; and although the number of the guns—44—is the same\r\nin each, she discharges a broadside 8.3 times heavier and in energy\r\noverwhelmingly superior. The speed of the battleship is one half\r\ngreater than that of the Constitution, and she carries armor varying\r\nfrom 18 inches to 4 inches thick, which the frigate wholly lacked. The\r\nlongitudinal section of the Oregon indicates the immense advance in\r\nother directions. Her hull is, for safety, minutely subdivided, and is\r\nprovided with engines for propulsion, steering, lighting, drainage,\r\nand ventilation, numbering in all 84, with miles of piping and\r\nhundreds of valves. The time-honored frigate was but a sail-propelled\r\ngun-platform, whose wants were as few as her construction was\r\nsimple; the steel-clad battleship is a mass of mechanism, a floating\r\nmachine-plant, which for full efficiency must be manned by a personnel\r\nnot only brave and daring as of old, but expert in many arts and\r\nsciences, which in the age of sail were but rudimentary or unknown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE I. CONSTITUTION (1812) UNDER SAIL.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. THE PROGRESS OF NAVAL ENGINEERING.\r\n\r\n“_I have just read the project of Citizen Fulton, Engineer, which you\r\nhave sent me much too late, since it is one which may change the face\r\nof the world._”\r\n\r\nSo, in the beginning of the century, wrote the first Napoleon from his\r\nImperial camp at Boulogne. Wrapped in his day-dream of a descent upon\r\nthe Thames, he saw, with prophetic vision, in the plans of the American\r\nengineer, the future of navigation, and he strove to grasp—but too\r\nlate—the opportunity which might have made his armada victorious over\r\nwind and tide.\r\n\r\nHis words, however, rang truer than he knew. On the sea, as on the\r\nland, the engineer has indeed “changed the face of the world;” and in\r\nno department of human progress has his influence been more radical or\r\nmore far-reaching than in the mechanism, the scope, and the strategy\r\nof naval war. Fleets move now with a swiftness and surety unthought\r\nof in the days of sail. Over the same western ocean which Nelson, in\r\nhis eager chase of Villeneuve, crossed at but four knots an hour, the\r\nUnited States cruiser Columbia swept, ninety years later, at a speed\r\nnearly four and three quarters times that of his lagging craft. When,\r\nin 1898, war came, the great battleship Oregon, although far to the\r\nnorthward on our western coast, was needed in the distant battle-line\r\noff the Cuban shore. In 79 days she steamed 14,500 miles, making a run\r\nwhich is without parallel or approach by any warship of any navy in\r\nthe world’s history. The magnificent manhood, the unconquerable pluck,\r\nthe engineering skill, which brought her just in time off Santiago,\r\nwon their reward when the Colon struck her flag. Speed has been a\r\ndetermining factor in many a naval action. It was that which gave the\r\npower to take and hold the old-time “weather-gauge.” None knew its\r\nvalue better than Nelson, the chief fighter of the age of sail. Once\r\nhe said that there would be found, stamped upon his heart, “the want\r\nof frigates,” the swift and nimble “eyes of the fleet” in his day. If\r\nhis career in warfare on the sea had been a century later, he would\r\nbe found foremost among the advocates of high-speed battleships and\r\nquick-firing guns.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, not only in the speed of warships that steam and\r\nmechanism have revolutionized fleets. For example, the displacement of\r\nthe battleship of to-day is fully three and one half times greater than\r\nthat of her heaviest ancestor of the sailing age. With due limitation\r\nas to length of hull, it is evident that the wind would be, at best,\r\na wholly inadequate and untrustworthy motor for this huge structure\r\nwith its great weight of armor. It is true that, during the era of\r\ntransition, sail and steam were both applied to iron-clads—this\r\nabsurdity reaching its climax in the British Agincourt and her sisters,\r\nwhich were 400 feet long, 10,600 tons’ displacement, and were fitted\r\nwith five masts. It is said that a merchant steamer narrowly escaped\r\ncollision at night with one of these vessels, believing from her length\r\nand rigging that there were _two_ ships ahead, between which she could\r\npass. What these large displacements mean, in contrast with those of\r\npast days, will be, perhaps, best illustrated by the statement that the\r\nItalia of 13,600 tons—a ship with which, in her day, Italy challenged\r\nthe criticism of the world—carries on her deck a weight, in armor\r\nand armament, of 2500 tons, or one fourth more than that of Nelson’s\r\nflagship Victory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE II.

Launched Oct. 21, 1797.]\r\n\r\nAgain, the largest naval gun in the year 1800 was one firing but a\r\n42-pound shot, while in the United States navy we have now the 13-inch\r\nrifle of 60 tons, with a projectile of 1100 pounds, and Great Britain\r\nhas afloat 1800-pounder breech-loaders which weigh 111 tons. Before\r\nmonster ordnance such as this, the strength of man, unaided, is but\r\ncrude and futile. He must call to his help—as he has done—steam as\r\nthe source of power for the electric, hydraulic, or pneumatic engines,\r\nwhich load, elevate, and train the gun.\r\n\r\nIn summing up the service of steam, directly or indirectly, to the\r\nship-of-war, it will be seen that the speed of the battleship has been\r\nincreased by fully 50 per cent., and that of the cruiser has been\r\ndoubled; that the displacement of the battleship is now three and\r\none half times that of her sailing predecessor; and that, since the\r\ncentury’s birth, the gun has grown to such extent that the projectile\r\nfor the Oregon’s main battery weighs 26 times that of the heaviest shot\r\nin the year 1800. This, however, is not all. Steam acts primarily,\r\nas well, to raise the anchor, to steer the ship, and to effect her\r\nlighting, heating, drainage, and ventilation. To the genius of James\r\nWatt there must be ascribed the possibility for the growth and change\r\nwhich have produced the modern man-of-war.\r\n\r\nClosely allied with mechanism in this evolution, has been the\r\ntransformation of the structural material of the hull, which has passed\r\nfrom the hands of the shipwright in wood to the engineer who works with\r\nsteel. The reasons for this are not far to seek. They lie, firstly,\r\nin the greater strength of the metal construction to withstand the\r\nvibration of swift and heavy machinery, and the strains arising from\r\nthe unequal distribution of massive weights in a hull which pitches or\r\nrolls with the waves. With wooden ships, the present proportions would\r\nhave been unattainable. Again, there is a marked saving in the weight\r\nof the hull proper of the steel vessel, which is not only stronger but\r\nlighter. This weight in the days of timber averaged fully one half\r\nof the displacement; while in the Oregon, whose tonnage, at normal\r\ndraught, is 10,288, the hull percentage is 44.06, leaving a gain over\r\nthe wooden vessel of 611 tons to be applied to armor, armament, or\r\nequipment. Finally, the durability of the metal vessel, with adequate\r\ncare, greatly exceeds that of the wooden war steamer, whose average\r\nlife was but 13 years.\r\n\r\nThe creation of the steam machinery of navies has been the achievement\r\nof the engineers of practically but three great nations. The daring of\r\nFrance, the inventive genius of America, and the wide experience and\r\nsound judgment of Great Britain, have united in this work. Our country\r\nhas led time and again in the march of improvement; although our\r\nprogress has been fitful, since, more than a generation ago, we turned\r\nfrom the sea to the development of the internal resources of this\r\ncontinent. Limits of space permit but brief review of a history which\r\nhas had its full share of triumphs, not only in battle, but over wave\r\nand wind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE U. S. S. OREGON.]\r\n\r\nA contemporary authority states that, when British Admiral Sir John\r\nBorlase Warren ascended the Potomac River, during the war of 1812, his\r\nexpedition was reconnoitred by an American steamer. This appears to be\r\nthe first record of the use of such craft for military purposes. In\r\n1814 the United States built the first steam war-vessel in the world’s\r\nhistory. She was called the Demologos, later the Fulton, and her\r\ncompletion marked truly, as her commissioners said, “an era in warfare\r\nand the arts.” She was a double-ended, twin-hulled floating battery\r\nof 2475 tons, carrying twenty 32-pdr. guns, protected by 4 ft. 10 in.\r\nof solid timber. She was driven by a single central paddle-wheel; her\r\nspeed was 5½ miles per hour; and she was both handy and seaworthy.\r\nFrance, in 1820, sent a commission to America to report upon steam\r\nvessels of war; and in 1830 the French had nine armed steamers afloat\r\nand nine building. In 1821, the Comet, a small side-wheeler, was\r\ncommissioned as the first steam war-ship in the British navy, and in\r\n1840, at the bombardment of Acre, steam vessels fought their first\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ACTION BETWEEN MONITOR AND MERRIMAC.]\r\n\r\nThe growth of steam in navies had been retarded by its application\r\nsolely to paddle craft, whose wheels and machinery were incapable of\r\nprotection in action. During the years 1842–43, however, the United\r\nStates built the sloop-of-war Princeton, of 954 tons. This vessel\r\nwas the product of the genius of John Ericsson, the ablest marine\r\nengineer the world has ever seen. She was the first screw-propelled\r\nsteam warship ever built, and, in other respects, foreshadowed the\r\nadvances which were to come. Thus, her machinery was the first to be\r\nplaced wholly below the water-line beyond the reach of hostile shot;\r\nher engine was the first to be coupled directly to the screw shaft, and\r\nblowers, for forced draft, were with her first used in naval practice.\r\nShe was virtually the herald of the modern era.\r\n\r\nThe Princeton was followed closely by the Rattler, the first screw\r\nvessel of the British fleet, and in 1843–44 the French 44-gun frigate\r\nPomone was fitted with propellers. In 1843, also, the English Penelope\r\nwas the first man-of-war to be equipped with tubular boilers, and the\r\nyear 1845 was notable for the building of the ill-fated Birkenhead,\r\nthe first iron vessel of the British fleet. In 1850, when the French\r\nconstructed the screw line-of-battle ship Napoleon, the English became\r\nalarmed, and began with vigor the renovation of their navy with regard\r\nto screw propulsion.\r\n\r\nFrance, in 1854, laid the keels of four armored batteries, three of\r\nwhich, forming the first ironclad squadron in history, went into action\r\na year later under the forts of Kinburn in the Crimea. They were of\r\n1600 tons’ displacement, carried 4⅓ inch armor and sixteen 68-pdr.\r\nguns, and had a speed of four knots. In 1862, Ericsson launched the\r\nfamous Monitor, the first sea-going ironclad with a revolving turret,\r\nand an “engineers’ ship” from keel to turret top.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TURBINIA.]\r\n\r\nThe Civil War found us with a sailing navy, and left us one of steam.\r\nPassing over its victories, in which steamers played always the chief\r\npart on sea and river, we come to that most notable triumph of Chief\r\nEngineer Isherwood, the cruiser Wampanoag of 4200 tons’ displacement.\r\nThis vessel, phenomenal in her day, steamed in February, 1868, from\r\nBarnegat to Savannah, over a stormy sea, in 38 hours. Her average was\r\n16.6 knots for the run, and 17 knots during a period of six consecutive\r\nhours—a speed which for 11 years thereafter was unapproached by liner\r\nor by warship. In 1879, the British despatch vessel Mercury, of 3730\r\ntons and 18.87 knots, wrested the palm from America; but, in 1893, it\r\nwas won again for the United States by the triple-screw fliers Columbia\r\nand Minneapolis of 7475 tons, with speeds respectively of 22.8 and\r\n23.073 knots. The laurels rest now with the Buenos Ayres, which,\r\nthough built in England in 1895, flies the flag of Argentina. She has a\r\ntonnage of 4500 and a speed of 23.202 knots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENGINE OF U.S.S.POWHATAN. A.D. 1849.\r\n\r\nPLATE III.]\r\n\r\nThe British ironclad Pallas, completed in 1866, was remarkable for\r\nhaving the first successful naval engines on the compound principle,\r\nin which the steam is admitted at high pressure to a small cylinder,\r\nand passes thence to a larger one which it fills by its expansion. To\r\nGreat Britain the world owes also the development of triple expansion,\r\ni. e., the use of steam successively in three cylinders. This system\r\nwas inaugurated in naval engines by the British, in 1885–86, and is\r\nnow universally employed. Prior to 1879, the boilers of all modern\r\nwar-vessels had been those of the Scotch type, in which the flame\r\npasses through tubes fixed in a cylindrical shell containing water. In\r\nthat year, however, France began a revolution in the steam generators\r\nof navies by equipping a dispatch-vessel with the Belleville tubulous\r\nboiler, in which the water to be evaporated is contained within tubes\r\nsurrounded by flame confined in an outer casing. The water-tube\r\nprinciple, also, bids fair to become of universal application. It has\r\nhad its most noteworthy naval installation in the British cruisers\r\nPowerful and Terrible, of 14,200 tons and 25,886 horse-power, completed\r\nin 1895.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IV. ENGINE OF U. S. S. ERICSSON.]\r\n\r\nThe use of more than one screw for propulsion dates back to 1853.\r\nDuring our Civil War multiple screws figured, to a small extent, in the\r\n“tin clads” and larger monitors. The application of twin screws, in the\r\nmodern era, begins with the British ironclad Penelope of 1868. France,\r\nin the years 1884–85, blazed the way for another naval advance of much\r\nimportance in conducting a series of trials with the launch Carpe,\r\nequipped with triple screws. The system, however, although of much\r\nvalue, from engineering and tactical points of view, was not adopted\r\nin large, high-powered vessels until the advent of the French armored\r\ncruiser Dupuy de Lôme in 1890, and the protected cruisers Columbia and\r\nMinneapolis of the United States navy in 1893. It has now won full\r\napproval in the navies of continental Europe, and triple-screw ships,\r\naggregating 500,000 tons, are built or building there.\r\n\r\nThe limits of space forbid more than a passing note of the triumphs\r\nof the engineer in torpedo craft, the light cavalry of the sea. With\r\nsteamers of normal proportions, the speed and power depend largely\r\nupon, and increase with, the displacement. As has been stated, the\r\nmaximum performance of large cruisers is now 23 knots on a tonnage\r\nof 4500. These particulars give a faint glimpse of the extraordinary\r\nproblem which has confronted the torpedo-boat designer in driving\r\nhulls of, at present, about 150 tons at a speed which now approximates\r\nto 30 knots. With the brilliant record of success in this task, there\r\nwill be linked always the names of Yarrow and Thornycroft in England,\r\nof Schichau in Germany, and of Normand in France. The achievement but\r\nrecently of a British inventor, the Hon. Charles Algernon Parsons, in\r\ngiving the Turbinia of 44.5 tons a speed of over 31 knots, has drawn\r\nthe attention of engineers the world over to the possibilities of the\r\nsteam turbine on the sea. This performance is phenomenal with such a\r\ndisplacement. The French Forban, of 130 tons, has made 31.2 knots,\r\nand a reported speed of 35 knots gives a Schichau boat her temporary\r\nlaurels as the fastest craft afloat.\r\n\r\nA brief glance at the improvements which have made possible these\r\nextreme speeds in cruisers and torpedo craft will be of interest. The\r\nprogress which has been made has been, firstly, in the economy in the\r\nuse of steam arising from higher pressures and multiple expansion;\r\nsecondly, in the reduction of weight, per horse power, due to increase\r\nin strength of materials and in engine-speed with the employment of\r\nforced draft—which was reintroduced by France—and the water-tube\r\nboiler; and, finally, in the application of a more efficient propelling\r\ninstrument. The advances of half a century in propelling machinery are\r\nshown, in some respects, by Plates III and IV, which contrast, on the\r\nsame scale, the side-wheel machinery of the United States war-steamer\r\nPowhatan, of 1849, with the engines of the United States torpedo boat\r\nEricsson of to-day. The data of the former vessel are: horse-power,\r\n1172; steam pressure 15 lbs.; weight of machinery per horse-power 972\r\nlbs.; while, for the Ericsson, the figures are: horse-power, 1800;\r\nsteam pressure, 250 lbs.; weight of machinery per horse-power, 56 lbs.\r\nThis comparison, however, must be qualified by the statement that the\r\nolder engine was for a steamer of about 3760 tons, while the torpedo\r\nboat is but 120 tons in displacement. The contrast lies, therefore,\r\nonly in the reduced weight of material per horse-power developed and in\r\nthe increased steam pressure, which, however, are in themselves most\r\nstriking.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. THE GROWTH OF ORDNANCE.\r\n\r\nAt Trafalgar, the Victory drifted before the wind into action. In her\r\nslow advance, at a speed of one and one half knots through but 1200\r\nyards, she was for half an hour under the prolonged fire of 200 guns,\r\nand yet she closed, practically unhurt, with her foes, and lived, not\r\nonly to win the day, but to bring undying glory to the English flag.\r\nWhat a contrast the latest sea-fight of the century presents in the\r\npower of modern ordnance as compared with the puny guns of Nelson’s\r\ntime! Our battleship Oregon, at a range of nearly five miles, with\r\none 1100-pound shell, drove the Colon, an armored cruiser, not only\r\nshoreward, but to surrender, stranding, and wreck.\r\n\r\nThe largest naval guns in the year 1800 were the long 32 and\r\n42-pounders, smooth-bore muzzle-loaders, with a range of about\r\n1200 yards. Carronades—short pieces with a heavy shot but limited\r\nrange—found favor also, especially with British sailors, eager for\r\nthat close-quarter fighting in which the “Smasher”—as General Melville\r\ncalled his carronade—would be most effective in shattering timbers\r\nand in sending clouds of splinters among the foe. The projectiles were\r\nspherical shot, canister, and grape, the diabolical shriek of the shell\r\nbeing yet unheard. Both gun and shot were of cast metal, and the\r\nmount was a wooden carriage on low trucks. The training, or horizontal\r\nangle of the gun, was effected by rope tackles, and the amount of\r\nelevation of its muzzle depended upon the position of a “quoin,” or\r\nwooden wedge, thrust beneath the breech. The recoil was limited by\r\nrope “breeching,” passing through the cascabel,—a knob behind the\r\nbreech,—and secured to ring-bolts in the ship’s side. The gun was\r\nharnessed, as a horse is, in the shafts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BATTLE OF TRAFALGAR.]\r\n\r\nAiming was largely a perfunctory process, since the gun had no sights\r\nand the shot had excessive “windage,” its calibre being from one fifth\r\nto one third inch less than the bore, making its outward passage\r\na series of rebounds and its final direction a matter of chance.\r\n“Windage,” however, was essential to facilitate muzzle-loading and to\r\nprovide for the expanded diameter of red-hot shot. It is true that in\r\n1801 a proposition to use sights was made to Lord Nelson. He, however,\r\nrejected it with the words:—\r\n\r\n“I hope we shall be able, as usual, to get so close to our enemies that\r\nour shot cannot miss the object.”\r\n\r\nHis blind courage in this cost his countrymen dearly when, in 1812–14,\r\ntheir shot flew wild, while their ships were hulled and their gallant\r\ntars fell before the then sighted guns of the United States.\r\n\r\nTo ignite the charge the slow-match was still used, as is shown by\r\nthe sharp words of a sailor of that time. Hailed in the darkness by a\r\nBritish ship and ordered to send a boat, his quick answer was:—\r\n\r\n“This is the United States frigate Constitution, Edward Preble,\r\ncommodore, commanding, and I’ll be d—d if I send a boat!”\r\n\r\nThen to his men, silent and eager by the shrouded battle-lanterns:—\r\n\r\n“Blow your matches, boys!”\r\n\r\nA full crew for a 32-pounder consisted of 14 men. An old rule as to\r\nthis was one man to every 500-lbs. weight of the gun, which would give\r\nthe Oregon 1100 men to handle the four 13-inch rifles of her main\r\nbattery, or more than twice her whole crew. Steam and mechanism have\r\nwrought a magic change in this.\r\n\r\nThe slow-match remained in use until well into the nineteenth century,\r\nalthough, until 1842, the flint lock was generally employed in the\r\nBritish navy, having replaced the priming horn and match in 1780.\r\nIn 1807 there was discovered a composition which could be ignited\r\nby friction or concussion, and in 1839 the French had adopted the\r\npercussion lock, which exploded the cap and retracted, uncovering the\r\nvent before the backward rush of the gas could strike it. Later, a\r\nsimilar composition was used with “friction-primers,” or tubes filled\r\nwith mealed powder and capped with composition, the tube forming a\r\ntrain leading to the charge, and the composition being fired by the\r\nfriction of a rough wire drawn briskly through it. Percussion and\r\nfriction have been in turn largely displaced by the electric primer,\r\nwhich consists essentially of a fine wire, or “bridge,” passing through\r\na highly inflammable mixture. The bridge offers a resistance to the\r\nelectric current, is heated thereby, ignites the composition, and fires\r\nthe gun.\r\n\r\nThe older type of the cast-iron smooth-bore gun for solid shot reached\r\nits ultimate development in the 68-pounder, which endured until the\r\nadvent of armor. In 1819 the system of firing shells loaded with\r\ngunpowder from smooth-bore guns was suggested by General Paixhans, of\r\nFrance. In 1824, it was introduced into the French navy, and about\r\n1840 into that of the United States. At Sinope, in 1853, the terrible\r\neffect of shell fire upon wooden ships startled the world, when a\r\nRussian fleet destroyed absolutely 11 Turkish vessels, with their force\r\nof 4000 men. The Paixhans gun was modified and its form improved by\r\nAdmiral Dahlgren, U. S. N., and in the late 50’s the armament—designed\r\nby him—of United States vessels was superior to that of any other in\r\nthe world. The 9, 11, and 15-inch Dahlgrens formed the bulk of our guns\r\nafloat during the Civil War, the remainder being almost wholly rifles\r\nof the Parrott type.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Growth of Ordnance_\r\n\r\n  _32pdr 6m Smooth-bore, Muzzle-loader\r\n  Weight 3600 lbs.

The principle of the former—making\r\nthe shot act as a screw-bolt and the bore as a screw-thread—is very\r\nold, there being at Woolwich a barrel of this type bearing date of\r\n1547. The objects aimed at in rifling are to give a pointed cylindrical\r\nshot rotation on its axis that it may keep steady during flight,\r\nand secondly, to obtain increased weight in the projectile from its\r\nelongated form. As to the latter consideration, it may be noted that\r\nthe old 32-pounder smooth-bore was of 6-inch calibre, while the United\r\nStates 6-inch rifle of to-day throws a shot of 100 lbs. weight.\r\n\r\nFrance, during the Crimean War, brought out the first heavy rifled gun.\r\nIn 1860–61, Armstrong rifles were introduced in the British navy. The\r\nlabors of Krupp met such success that at Paris, in 1867, he exhibited\r\na rifle weighing 50 tons with a projectile of 1080 pounds. The Parrott\r\nrifle was brought out about 1856 in the United States, and was so\r\ndeveloped that in 1862 it was the most powerful gun, for its weight and\r\nsize, in existence. The adoption of rifling was the first great step\r\non the road which engineering had laid toward the growth in power of\r\nmodern ordnance.\r\n\r\nHaving thus secured a projectile of great weight and moderate calibre\r\nwhich would bore through the air a true path to the distant mark,\r\nthere remained to seek but four chief elements in the magnificent\r\nadvance made within a generation by the naval artillery of our day.\r\nThese factors were: 1st. Increased strength in the material of the\r\ngun. 2d. A method of construction which would not only permit enormous\r\npressures in the powder-chamber, but would make possible the continuous\r\nacceleration of the projectile during its passage through the bore.\r\n3d. An explosive which would satisfy the objects of the method of\r\nconstruction; and, 4th. A system of loading which would enable guns of\r\ngreat length to be charged with ease. The mounting of ordnance of any\r\nweight, its control, and its rapid and facile handling were but minor\r\nmatters of engineering.\r\n\r\nIn a paper such as this, of limited length and addressed to laymen,\r\nit is possible to give but a glance at the progress in the various\r\nelements of gun-construction which have been noted. Of material, little\r\nneed be said. The rifle of Crimean days was a cast-iron piece; Parrott\r\nordnance was of cast and wrought iron; and the first Armstrong gun was\r\nbuilt of wrought iron and steel. Cast and compound materials, however,\r\nhave vanished with the past. Steel—hardened and toughened to the last\r\ndegree by every refinement of manufacture—forms the “reeking tube” for\r\nthe “iron shard” of the century’s close.\r\n\r\nThe method of construction is the “built-up” process, shown by the\r\npartial section on Plate V., the barrel being reinforced by tubes\r\nwhich are shrunk on—like the tire of a wagon-wheel—so as to produce\r\ninitial compression. The explosion in the powder chamber strains and\r\nexpands temporarily the barrel, and the application of the shrinkage\r\nprinciple enables a portion of the strength of the tubes to be employed\r\nin preliminary internal pressure. The barrel thus supported can be\r\nstrained by the charge, not only to its own limit of safety, but to an\r\nadditional amount equal to this initial compression. The all-steel,\r\nbuilt-up gun has a possible rival in wire-wound ordnance, a system\r\nwhich replaces the tubes, to a greater or less extent, by layers of\r\nwire, wound while in tension around the barrel.\r\n\r\nPowder is the soul of the gun; it transforms the huge inert mass into\r\na flaming engine of death. The great development of explosives began\r\nbut a generation since. The researches of Robins and Rumford in the\r\nlast century, and of Hutton in the dawn of this, formed the world’s\r\nknowledge of the gun’s internal ballistics until the year 1870. To the\r\ngenius of Noble and Abel is due the stimulus to growth since then.\r\nThe powders have kept pace with gun-construction in its advance.\r\nThe increased strength of the chamber has been met by heavier and\r\nslow-burning charges—cocoa, brown prismatic, and the like—which have\r\ngiven not only greater initial velocity, but a continuous acceleration\r\nthrough bores whose maximum length has exceeded 47 feet. Indeed, to\r\nthe production of this lingering combustion is due the great linear\r\ndimension and power of modern guns. Initial pressure had its limit;\r\nadvance lay only in the subsequent acceleration given by late ignition\r\nof a portion of the charge.\r\n\r\nGunpowder, however, after a reign of more than five hundred years,\r\nhas been dethroned. The “villainous saltpetre” of the monk, with its\r\nallies, charcoal and sulphur, yields now to nitro compounds, which\r\nproduce not only far greater energy, but are as well smokeless. The\r\nsea-fights of our war with Spain saw the last contending fleets to\r\nbe wrapped in a cloud, lingering and baffling, of their own making.\r\nCordite, one of these compounds in use abroad, is prepared in long\r\n“cords” from di-nitro-cellulose and nitro-glycerine. The new smokeless\r\n“powder” of the United States navy is made from nitro-cellulose\r\ndissolved in ether alcohol. France was the first in employing\r\nexplosives such as these, which, in their offensive and tactical\r\nadvantages, form one of the signal triumphs of the century’s last years.\r\n\r\nThe long gun of modern days is of necessity breech-loading. The\r\ndevelopment of other elements gave, as a resultant, great length;\r\nand this, in turn, required a system of charging which would\r\npermit protection for the men while loading, and would obviate the\r\nintolerable inconvenience of ramming home powder and shot in a long\r\nmuzzle-loader—an operation which was, in fact, impossible beyond a\r\ncertain limit of length. The advocates of the older construction,\r\nespecially in England, urged long and earnestly its simplicity and\r\nthe superior strength of a solid breech; but the logic of events was\r\nagainst them, and the breech-loader won a complete triumph. It is\r\nworthy of note that it, like rifling and the principle of building up,\r\nwas but a revival. From the warship Mary Rose, sunk in 1545 in action\r\noff Spithead, there were recovered in 1836 a number of guns, some of\r\nwhich are of wrought iron, built-up and breech-loading. There are in\r\nuse two methods of closing the breech when the gun is loaded from the\r\nrear. In French, English, and American ordnance an axial screw-plug is\r\ninserted; in the Krupp system a cylindro-prismatic breech-block slides\r\nin a horizontal opening cut across the bore. The former, or interrupted\r\nscrew mechanism, was first set forth in the United States’ patent of\r\n1849 to Chambers.\r\n\r\nIn projectiles the tendency of the modern era has been towards\r\nsimplification. Bar-shot, chain-shot, and grape have disappeared, while\r\ncanister and solid shot are becoming obsolete. There remain shrapnel as\r\nthe “man-killer” of this age, and explosive shell, differentiated into\r\narmor-piercing and that for attack on unarmored structures. Lieutenant\r\nShrapnel, in 1796, invented the projectile which bears his name. In its\r\nmodern form, it consists of a steel case containing lead or iron balls\r\nand a light bursting charge of powder, ignited by a time-fuse carried\r\nin the head. This projectile is most formidable against bodies of men,\r\nboats, and the embrasures of forts, since, when it is ruptured, the\r\nballs are dispersed, covering a wide area.\r\n\r\nThe use of explosive shell in high-angle discharge dates back to\r\nthe fifteenth century. From Paixhans’ works, “La Nouvelle Arme,”\r\npublished in 1821, came the stimulus to its development and to its\r\ndeadly service, in our time, in horizontal fire. The “common shell”\r\nfor the United States 13-inch rifle is made of forged steel, weighs\r\n1100 pounds, and carries within it a bursting charge of 50 pounds of\r\npowder, ignited by a percussion fuse set in its base. It will penetrate\r\n6 or 7 inches of armor and then explode within the ship. The United\r\nStates “armor-piercing shell” is manufactured from crucible steel,\r\nalloyed with chromium; it is tempered to extreme hardness at the point,\r\nwhich carries a cap of soft metal. The function of the latter would\r\nappear to be that of a support to the shoulder of the projectile, or\r\nas a lubricant thereto, since, without the cap, the shell is broken or\r\ndeformed in the attack on armor of surface hardened steel. To resist\r\nthe crushing strain in its passage through massive plate, the walls\r\nof this shell must be so thick that no charge of gunpowder will burst\r\nit. Hence, as a rule, the shell is fired unloaded, although recently\r\nthere have been adopted to some extent bursting charges of some high\r\nexplosive, such as gun-cotton, joveite, or picric acid.\r\n\r\nIn closing this brief review of the progress of ordnance, but passing\r\nmention can be made of matters minor, but in themselves of much\r\nimportance. Gun carriages, or mounts, are now intricate mechanisms,\r\npractically the whole service of large ordnance being performed by\r\nelectric and hydraulic machinery. The rapid fire principle has been\r\nextended to pieces of 6-inch calibre, and bids fair to pass beyond that\r\nlimit. Its success in increasing largely the number of shots within a\r\ngiven time lies in special breech-blocks, aiming devices, and prepared\r\ncartridges. Machine guns of rifle-calibre, partly or wholly automatic,\r\nhave been so developed as to be capable of firing 1200 rounds per\r\nminute. The discharge of high explosives in large quantity was effected\r\nwith success by the United States steamer Vesuvius off Santiago. The\r\ntorpedo-gun afloat, however, would appear to be still in a tentative\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nA brief lapse into technical terms may be permitted in summarizing the\r\ngun’s growth in power. The term “muzzle energy” is used to describe the\r\nwork which the projectile is capable of performing when it leaves the\r\nbore. It is expressed in foot-tons, i. e., the number of tons which\r\nthe energy stored in the shot would lift to a height of one foot. The\r\nfigures as to this for the 32-pounder of the century’s beginning, for\r\nthe United States 13-inch rifle and for the 111-ton English gun, are,\r\nrespectively, 642, 33,627, and 54,690 foot-tons. Again, the round shot\r\nfrom the 32-pounder lost from the resistance of the air, in a range of\r\n1200 yards, 76 per cent of its energy; while this loss, with the United\r\nStates 13-inch, in a range of 1000 yards, is but 11 per cent. Finally,\r\nif the cast-iron shot of the 32-pounder were fired against armor-plate,\r\nit would lose, in breaking itself up, two thirds of its remaining\r\nenergy, leaving at 1200 yards but 51 foot-tons for effective work;\r\nwhile with the modern armor-piercing shell the entire energy left at\r\nthe end of the range is expended upon the armor-plate.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen then that the immeasurable superiority of modern guns\r\nis owing both to their great increase in energy and to their wiser\r\ndisposition of that which has been attained. The gun has maintained\r\nfully during the century its primacy among naval weapons. It is\r\ntrue that, in theory and on paper, its supremacy has at times been\r\nquestioned; but as to its two rivals, the ram would seem to be rather\r\nthe weapon of accident than action, and the torpedo has yet to score\r\nin battle against ships in motion, while the precision, rapidity, and\r\npower of the gun grow more deadly with every passing year.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. THE DEVELOPMENT OF ARMOR.\r\n\r\nArmor and the gun are natural and now hereditary foes. The function\r\nof the one is to resist, that of the other ever to attack. Since the\r\nbeginning of the modern era in navies, there has been ceaseless strife\r\nfor mastery between these two elements of warship design, the gun\r\never becoming more powerful, and the armor—at first through growing\r\nthickness and later through improved material—opposing a steadily more\r\nstubborn front. The official report of an English committee made in the\r\nyear 1860 states that,—\r\n\r\n“Vessels clothed in rolled-iron plates of four and a half inches’\r\nthickness are to all practicable purposes invulnerable against any\r\nprojectile that can be brought to bear against them at any range.”\r\n\r\nThe advance which forty years have seen may be shown by the single\r\nstatement that the Krupp 15.7-inch gun develops sufficient energy to\r\npenetrate at the muzzle 47 inches of wrought iron. The battleship is at\r\nbest but a series of compromises, each factor of the structure yielding\r\nor growing as the skill or whim of her designer may indicate. In the\r\npresent stage of this unceasing change, the gun would appear to be\r\nthe victor, and the power of this mighty 132-ton rifle seems scarcely\r\nneeded on the sea. The distinguished chief of ordnance of the United\r\nStates navy, in his annual report for 1898, says:—\r\n\r\n“The development of the 12-inch gun has been so great and its power so\r\nmuch increased that the Bureau is of opinion that hereafter it will\r\nbe the maximum calibre that it will be advisable to install on future\r\nbattleships.”\r\n\r\nWith armor, as with the torpedo, the talent of Europe reaped where\r\nthe genius of America had sown. John Stevens of New Jersey was the\r\nfirst inventor of modern times to suggest the application of armor to\r\na floating battery, his plans being submitted to the United States\r\ngovernment during the war of 1812. They received, however, no serious\r\nconsideration, and to France, forty-two years later, fell the honor of\r\nattaining the first practical results in the building of ironclads.\r\nMembers of the Stevens family, however, continued the experiments of\r\nits founder, until by the year 1841 they had determined the thickness\r\nof iron necessary to stop spherical projectiles at point blank range,\r\nand the comparative resisting powers of iron and oak. These results led\r\nto an appropriation by Congress, in 1854, of $500,000 to begin work\r\nupon an ironclad,—the Stevens battery,—which vessel, however, never\r\nleft the ways and was eventually broken up.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VI. THE DISTRIBUTION OF ARMOR.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VII. THE DISTRIBUTION OF ARMOR.]\r\n\r\nGeneral Paixhans, who revolutionized naval artillery by the invention\r\nof the modern shell, prophesied, in an official letter to the French\r\ngovernment in 1824, that the new projectile would force the creation\r\nof armored ships. In 1841 he recommended officially the clothing of\r\nvessels with iron armor, as a protection against his own missiles; and\r\nin 1853 his words of warning met complete and terrible fulfillment in\r\nthe annihilation by shell guns of the Turkish fleet at Sinope. This\r\naction was the immediate cause of the introduction of armor in modern\r\nnavies.\r\n\r\nThe British admiralty, in 1843, had duplicated the Stevens experiments,\r\nusing a target of 14 plates of boiler iron riveted together, which gave\r\na total thickness of 6 inches; and experiments on laminated plating\r\nhad been also at this time carried on at Gavres, in France. In 1845\r\nDupuy de Lôme, the famous naval architect, submitted to the French\r\ngovernment the first European design for an armored frigate. His plans\r\nwere, however, rejected; and only with the outbreak of the Crimean War\r\nwas the construction of armored vessels begun. On October 17, 1855,\r\nthe three French batteries which were the first results of this new\r\ndeparture went into action off Kinburn, in the Crimea, silencing in\r\nfour hours forts which had held at bay the combined fleets of England\r\nand France. Armor had won its first victory, and had shown most\r\nsignally its position as one of the main factors in the warship design\r\nof the years which were to come.\r\n\r\nThese vessels, with three similar batteries constructed immediately\r\nthereafter by the British government, were clad with solid iron plates\r\n4½ inches thick, backed by 27¾ inches of oak, comparative experiments\r\nat Vincennes, France, having shown the marked superiority of solid\r\nover laminated plating. They were, however, in but a most limited\r\nsense sea-going ships, their low speed and other inferior qualities\r\nbeing radical defects as to this. France led in a further advance,\r\nbeginning in 1857 and completing in 1859 the transformation of the\r\nwooden line-of-battle ship Napoleon into the armored vessel of 5000\r\ntons, which, as La Gloire, is famous as the first sea-going ironclad.\r\nShe carried a strake of 4¾-inch plating at the water line, and 4½-inch\r\nplates in wake of the battery. England answered the challenge of her\r\nhereditary foe with the Warrior, an iron vessel of 9210 tons, completed\r\nin 1861. While her rival had a fully armored side, but 212 of the\r\nWarrior’s 380 feet of length carried plating. Its thickness was 4½\r\ninches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _“La Gloire” (France) 1857.\r\n  Side Armor Iron 4½ in. Solid._\r\n\r\n  _“Warrior” (England) 1859.\r\n  Side Armor Iron 4½ in.

THE GROWTH OF ARMOR.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAt the outbreak of the Civil War in the United States, the government\r\nappointed a special naval committee to report upon types of ironclads.\r\nThe conclusions of this board are of interest, in showing the state of\r\narmor development at that period. They required rolled armor of solid\r\niron, whose minimum thickness was 4½ inches. Ericsson’s Monitor,\r\nhowever, carried laminated plating from 3 to 5 inches thick on her\r\nlow sides, and 11 layers, each one inch thick, on her turret. This\r\nconstruction, which the difficulties in the manufacture of solid plate\r\nnecessitated, made the record of endurance of this type far from good.\r\nThe defect lay mainly with fastening bolts, which broke frequently,\r\nthus loosening or detaching the side armor, and the heads or nuts of\r\nwhich, flying off with violence when the armor was struck by shot,\r\nbecame sometimes fatal missiles against those within the turrets. In\r\ncontrast with this, the behavior of the New Ironsides, clothed with\r\nsolid armor, was most excellent. She was a casemated ironclad frigate\r\nwith unarmored ends, her plating was 4½ inches thick, and inclined\r\nthroughout the citadel, at an angle of 30° from the perpendicular. For\r\ntwo years she was subjected to the most severe test that a war-vessel\r\nmust meet, the tossing and straining of blockade duty and the fiery\r\nordeal of close action with fortifications. In one engagement, she\r\nsustained alone a fight against the combined fire of the forts in\r\nCharleston harbor, and, although struck on her side-armor sixty times,\r\ncame out of the struggle unhurt. The record of this ship is one which\r\ndoes honor to the flag.\r\n\r\nThe achievement of the Confederacy during this war, in the matter of\r\narmor, was remarkable. With iron worth almost its weight in gold, and\r\nwith most limited facilities for manufacturing, they yet succeeded in\r\nconstructing some of the most formidable ironclads of their day. The\r\nMerrimac, for instance—with 3-inch armor, in two layers of narrow\r\nbars, at an angle of 30° with the horizontal—sustained no material\r\ndamage to her plating from the fire of the Monitor; although had the\r\nfull charge of 30 lbs. of powder been used in the 11-inch smooth-bores\r\nof the latter, the story would have been different. Every fair blow\r\nwould have smashed a hole completely through the armor, and driven a\r\nshower of splinters about the battery-deck. Again, the armor of the\r\nAtlanta and the Tennessee—both casemated ships, with the sides of the\r\ncitadel inclined at a sharp angle to the horizontal—was sufficiently\r\nstrong, with the former vessel, to withstand, at 500 yards, the 11-inch\r\nprojectile fired with a 20-lbs. charge, and, with the latter, the same\r\nshot practically at the muzzle, although the 15-inch projectile broke\r\nthrough completely in both cases.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to follow in detail, through its many tests in peace,\r\nthe advance of iron armor. Its growth in strength, as the power of\r\nthe gun developed, came almost solely from increase in thickness, the\r\nlatter reaching its maximum with the British Inflexible, completed\r\nin 1876, which carries from 16 to 24 inches of iron on her belt and\r\ncitadel. This plating, however, is divided and “sandwiched” with wood,\r\nthere being, exterior to the skin, 6 inches of teak, then 12 inches\r\niron, 11 inches teak, and an outer 12-inch plate. As armor, iron\r\nreceived its death-blow in the famous tests at Spezia, Italy, during\r\nthe autumn of 1876, when the 100-ton gun, with a full charge, at a\r\nrange of 100 yards, attacked solid and “sandwich” targets of iron and\r\nsolid targets of steel—the single or aggregate thickness of metal\r\nin each case being 22 inches. These trials were undertaken through\r\nItaly’s desire to build, in the Duilio and Dandolo, the most formidable\r\nvessels afloat. Steel won the day, and the roar of that mighty gun,\r\nthundering from the Spezia firing ground, sounded the knell of iron\r\narmor, deprived the as yet unlaunched Inflexible of her crown of\r\ninvulnerability, and demanded, with success, a revolution in the armor\r\nmanufacture of Europe.\r\n\r\nAs a compromise, compound armor, i.e., iron faced with steel, became\r\npopular for a time. As with steel, its beginnings were old, dating\r\nback at least to the year 1857. The first perfected compound plate,\r\nmade by Cammel & Co., of England, was tested at Shoeburyness in 1877.\r\nIt was composed of 5 inches of iron with a 4-inch face of steel; the\r\niron being raised to a welding heat and the molten steel poured on its\r\ntop. The great heat partially fused the contact face, the two metals\r\nwere united, and the combination was assured by immediate rolling.\r\nCompound plates sprang in 1877 from obscurity to popularity; by 1879\r\niron armor had become obsolete with progressive naval powers, and, in\r\n1880, both compound and steel plates had reached such development that\r\nthey were close rivals, the leading competitors being Cammel in England\r\nand Schneider in France. Steel, however, slowly forged ahead during\r\nthe next decade; and, at its close, compound armor was practically\r\nout of the race. In steel’s victory, its alloy with nickel, in minute\r\nproportions, has materially aided; the combination imparting hardness\r\nwithout decreasing the toughness of the plate. This material gave\r\nsuperior results from the beginning. Its first plate, tested in 1889,\r\nwas 9⅓ inches thick; it was pierced by a Holtzer shell, whose body\r\ndid not pass wholly through and whose energy was 1.6 times that just\r\nnecessary to perforate a wrought-iron plate of the same thickness. To\r\nthe increased strength given by nickel there has been added a further\r\ngain through the application of face-hardening processes—such as that\r\nof the American, Harvey—which produce superficial carbonization,\r\ntransforming the surface into a high grade of very hard steel,\r\nwithout the pronounced plane of demarcation between the two qualities\r\nof metal, as in the weld of the compound plate. A 10¼-inch nickel\r\nsteel Harveyized plate, tested at the Indian Head Proving Grounds in\r\n1892, showed a strength which previously had never been equaled in\r\nthe history of armor, and established beyond question the value of\r\nthe face-hardening process, which, by various methods, is applied to\r\nthe nickel-steel plating of to-day. The distribution of armor in the\r\ndevelopment of battleship construction is shown by the shaded sections\r\non Plates VI and VII, and its relative thicknesses, on various vessels\r\nduring this progress, by Plate VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. THE RAM AND THE TORPEDO.\r\n\r\nFor two thousand years the ram—the razor-edged “beak” of the swift\r\ngalley—was the chief naval weapon. With the advent of sail-power and\r\nthe employment of gunpowder, it vanished from the seas; but to reappear\r\nwhen the coming of steam gave again controllable propulsion. In 1859\r\nthere was built into the French frigate Magenta a sharp spur,—the\r\nfirst modern ram. British construction of the modern era, from the\r\nWarrior down, has also recognized this weapon, and it is to-day a\r\nfactor, although a minor one, in the design of all vessels of high\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\nThe ram has, however, but a scant record of service in action, while in\r\naccidental collision it has wrought more than once appalling disaster.\r\nThe ironclad Merrimac rammed and sank in Hampton Roads, in March,\r\n1862, the United States sailing sloop-of-war Cumberland, which, under\r\nthe gallant Morris, went down with guns thundering and ensign flying.\r\nOn July 20, 1866, during the action off the island of Lissa, in the\r\nAdriatic, the Austrian flagship Ferdinand Maximilian rammed the Italian\r\narmorclad Re d’ Italia, which, with many of her 800 men, sank with\r\na swiftness that chilled the blood of those who watched. Like this,\r\nin its sudden tragedy, was the destruction of the British battleship\r\nVictoria by her consort, the Camperdown, off Tripoli, Syria, in the\r\nsummer sunlight of a June day in 1893. The ram of the latter vessel cut\r\na deep and fatal gash in the Victoria, which within ten minutes turned\r\nbottom upward and went down, bow first, bearing with her 321 officers\r\nand men, whose unfaltering discipline gave a heroic splendor to their\r\nend. Despite these occasional instances of its deadly power, the ram\r\nholds a secondary place among naval weapons. To strike a modern vessel\r\nat high speed will require more than the skill of the swordsman.\r\n\r\nThe torpedo, like the ironclad, was an American invention, whose\r\nneglect by the United States government brought retribution when this\r\ndeadly engine of war in 1861–65 destroyed not a few war-vessels flying\r\nour flag. Bushnell of Connecticut during the Revolution appears to have\r\ninvented both the submarine boat and the marine torpedo, the latter\r\nbeing fired by clock-work. Fulton also met success in similar work\r\nduring the period extending from 1801 to 1812. All of the elements of\r\nmodern torpedo warfare, excepting the use of steam, compressed air, or\r\nelectricity as a motive power, had been thus conceived by the early\r\ndawn of this century. The torpedoes of our day are practically of but\r\ntwo classes: the “mine,” or stationary (either “buoyant” or “ground,”\r\nas its position in the water determines), and the automobile, or\r\n“fish” torpedo. The former type is fired either by closing an electric\r\ncircuit in a station on shore, or by the ship herself in contact,\r\nor in electric closure. During the Civil War nearly thirty vessels\r\nwere sunk by mines, usually wooden barrels filled with gunpowder and\r\nfired by hauling lines or slow-burning fuses. It was a mine-field\r\nover which Farragut charged at Mobile Bay, when he uttered his famous\r\noath and went “full speed ahead,” with the cases of the fortunately\r\nimpotent torpedoes striking the Hartford’s bottom; it was a mine which,\r\nit is claimed, sunk the Maine; and it was a mine-field which kept\r\nSampson’s battleships from entering the harbor of Santiago de Cuba.\r\nThe stationary torpedo is now charged with gun cotton or other high\r\nexplosive.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the most prominent of the automobile torpedoes is due\r\nto Captain Lupuis of the Austrian navy, and its development from 1864\r\nonward to Whitehead, an Englishman. It is a cigar-shaped submarine\r\nvessel from 14 to 19 inches maximum diameter and from 14 to 19 feet\r\nlong, which is blown from a torpedo-tube or gun within the ship by\r\ncompressed air or an impulse charge of gunpowder. Twin-screw engines\r\ncontained within its hull, and driven by compressed air stored in\r\na reservoir therein, drive it at about thirty knots speed through\r\nan effective range of 600 yards. In its nose or “war-head” there\r\nis carried a large charge of gun cotton or other high explosive,\r\nwhich is fired by contact with the enemy’s hull. It is provided with\r\nboth horizontal and vertical rudders, the depth of immersion being\r\nregulated by intricate machinery contained in the “balance-chamber.”\r\nThe Whitehead has a somewhat formidable rival in the United States in\r\nthe torpedo invented by Rear Admiral Howell, U. S. N. The automobile\r\ntorpedo has never yet scored in battle against ships in motion. Its\r\nposition in the naval warfare of the future is yet unfixed. The one\r\ncertainty is, that its blow when struck home is almost surely fatal to\r\nship and crew. The development of the submarine torpedo-boat, whose\r\nweapon is the Whitehead, has in recent years received much attention\r\nthrough the labors of the American Holland and others. France, in the\r\nGustavus Zede, of 260 tons, has a diving boat of this character, for\r\nwhich much is claimed.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. THE UNITED STATES FLEET.\r\n\r\nUntil the advent of the ironclad, the ships of the United States were\r\nequal, if not superior, in seaworthiness and fighting qualities to any\r\nin the world. The high standard set by the Constitution and her class\r\nof 1797 was maintained for sixty years; and, especially during the\r\nperiod from 1840 to 1860, the officers and men of the United States\r\nnavy trod the decks of the finest ships afloat. They felt—as their\r\nsuccessors feel—that, ton for ton and gun for gun, they had no foe to\r\nfear. The early steamers of the Powhatan class built in the late 40’s\r\nwere a credit to the nation; the five screw frigates of the Merrimac\r\ntype (1856–57) aroused the admiration and imitation of foreign experts,\r\nand the five corvettes which followed them in 1858–59–60, of which the\r\nnoble Hartford was the chief, bore their full share in the war which\r\nwas so soon to come. The gallant Kearsarge was the leader of a new\r\nclass introduced in 1859.\r\n\r\nDuring the Civil War two vessels, the Monitor and the New Ironsides,\r\nappeared which have left lasting traces on all battleship construction\r\nsince their day. The great fleet of monitors, “tin-clads,” “90-day\r\ngunboats,” “double-enders,” and the like, which preceded and followed\r\nthem during those dark years, served their country well. With the\r\nending of that war, in the internal task of reconstruction and\r\ndevelopment, our maritime power was neglected and our fleet dwindled\r\naway. Its _renaissance_ dates from the appointment of the first Naval\r\nAdvisory Board in June, 1881. The growth since then has been so much\r\na matter of national interest and pride that it needs no detailed\r\nrecounting here; its results have been summarized previously herein.\r\n\r\nThe sea-going personnel of the United States navy includes the\r\nline, medical, pay, and marine officers, the chaplains and warrant\r\nofficers—a total on March 1, 1899, of 1589, with an enlisted force of\r\n17,196 blue-jackets and 3166 marines. The officers who serve on shore\r\nare the naval constructors, civil engineers, and the professors of\r\nmathematics, a total of 69.\r\n\r\nLine officers are the commanders, navigators, gunners, and, by recent\r\nlaw, the engineers of our ships of war. Marine officers have charge\r\nof the policing of ships and shore-stations and of the guns of light\r\ncalibre afloat. The duties of the remaining officers are indicated by\r\ntheir titles. The titles of line officers and their relative rank, as\r\ncompared with that of officers of the army, are:—\r\n\r\n        NAVY.                       ARMY.\r\n\r\n  Admiral                     General.\r\n  Rear-Admiral                Major or Brigadier-General.\r\n  Captain                     Colonel.\r\n  Commander                   Lieutenant-Colonel.\r\n  Lieutenant-Commander        Major.\r\n  Lieutenant                  Captain.\r\n  Lieutenant Junior Grade     First Lieutenant.\r\n  Ensign                      Second Lieutenant.\r\n\r\nLine and marine officers and naval constructors are educated at\r\nthe United States Naval Academy; all other officers are appointed\r\nfrom civil life. The Academy was founded in 1845 and is located at\r\nAnnapolis, Md. The course comprises four years at the school and two\r\nyears at sea on a naval vessel. The number of cadets at Annapolis is\r\nusually about 260.\r\n\r\nIt is by reason of wars that navies exist, and a few words as to\r\nour—now happily ended—conflict with Spain, may fitly close this\r\nreview of naval progress. The military lessons of that struggle\r\nhave been fully set forth by able writers. More important, by far,\r\nthan these is its teaching as regard to our state and future as a\r\nnation. The world has learned that the people of these United States\r\nare stirred still by the same stern and dauntless spirit which, in\r\nRevolution and Civil War, has made and kept us a nation. Furthermore,\r\nwith one swift stroke, the bounds which in theory and in territory\r\ncircumscribed us have been swept away, and the United States have\r\npassed from a continental to a world power. This is not chance. It is\r\nbut the leading onward to a destiny whose splendor we may not measure\r\nnow, whose light and peace and prosperity shall traverse a hemisphere.\r\nThe one note of sadness in it all is the memory of the gallant dead,\r\nof the heroes who fell that this might be. To them, in Cuba and the\r\nPhilippines, Columbia—with a smile of pride and a sob of pain—drinks\r\nin the wine of tears to-day, as the smoke of battle fades.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nASTRONOMY DURING THE CENTURY\r\n\r\nBY SELDEN J. COFFIN, A.M.,\r\n\r\n_Professor of Astronomy, Lafayette College, Easton, Pa._\r\n\r\nITS PROGRESS, ACHIEVEMENTS, AND NOTABLE RESULTS\r\n\r\n\r\nAstronomy, the oldest of all the family of sciences, is not a whit\r\nbehind its sister branches in activity of research and brilliance of\r\ndiscovery. The assiduity and zeal of its devotees are marvelous. The\r\ncelestial field is so wide, the depths of space between the stars so\r\nvast, that no assurance can ever be given to an astronomer that a\r\nlifetime of faithful and intelligent research will be rewarded with\r\neven a single discovery of importance. In this respect it differs\r\nmaterially from other branches of science.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the patient labor of those who serve in its temple has\r\nrarely failed to receive an adequate reward. The discovery made in\r\nAugust, 1877, by Professor Asaph Hall, of Washington, that the planet\r\nMars is attended by two satellites, is a convincing illustration\r\nof this peculiarity of the pursuit of astronomy as a study. An\r\nindefatigable watcher of the skies for many years, Professor Hall,\r\nlooking at this planet at its opposition in 1877, when it was unusually\r\nnear to the earth, was surprised to note two tiny points of light\r\nquite close to it; seeing them again the next evening, changed in\r\ntheir positions relative to Mars, it flashed upon him that the firm\r\ntradition that Mars had no moons was now disproved. His name will\r\nbe forever associated with these two bodies, Deimos and Phobos, as\r\ntheir discoverer, although they are but wee orbs, only seven miles in\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. ASTRONOMY A CENTURY AGO.\r\n\r\nThe end of the eighteenth century found the Copernican theory of\r\nastronomy well established, the principles laid down by Kepler and\r\nNewton fully elaborated, and the application of the higher mathematics\r\nto the needs of astronomy complete. But there were, as yet, no large\r\ntelescopes, and observatories were few. In Germany, a great disposition\r\nto make observations in this science and in meteorology was displayed\r\nin 1783 and for a few years following, and the records then made have\r\nproved of much value in confirming discoveries announced at later\r\nperiods.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir William Herschel, on March 13, 1781, pointed out a little star\r\nin the constellation of the Twins, and found that it had a perceptible\r\ndisk and a slight motion, and was therefore not a star, but a newly\r\nfound planet, to which the name Uranus was soon given, a careful\r\ninspection of the notebooks of previous observers showed that Uranus\r\nhad been observed and recorded as a fixed star on twenty previous\r\noccasions in that century. One man had seen it twelve times, and made\r\nhis record of it on a paper bag purchased at a perfumer’s. Had he been\r\na man of sufficient order and method to have penned what he saw on the\r\nregular records of his observatory, to him would have come the glory of\r\nthe great discovery of that century.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. HOW “BODE’S LAW” PROMOTED RESEARCH.\r\n\r\nAn erroneous guess, if it is a good guess, sometimes produces excellent\r\nresults. In 1778, Bode, of Berlin, published a “law” that states the\r\ndistances of the various planets from the sun. It is often expressed\r\nsimply in this way: Set down 4, and add to it successively the numbers\r\n3, 6, 12, 24, etc., and the sums obtained, viz., 4, 7, 10, 16, 28,\r\netc., represent the relative distances of all the planets from the\r\nsun, viz., Mercury 4, Venus 7, Earth 10, Mars 16, [Asteroids 28],\r\nJupiter 52, etc. In reference to all the planets then known to exist,\r\nthe correspondence of the alleged law to the facts was remarkable. The\r\none point in which the alleged system utterly failed was in requiring\r\nthe existence of a planet to fill the gap between Mars and Jupiter. So\r\nboldly did Biela press his convictions of the correctness of this law\r\nupon the notice of his fellow-workers, that they resolved, in 1800,\r\nto divide the zodiac into twenty-four zones, to be apportioned among\r\nthem, for the express purpose of searching for undiscovered planets.\r\nThis well-organized effort was, erelong, rewarded by the surprising\r\ndiscovery of four new planets, the first one on the first night of\r\nthe new century, January 1, 1801, and three more soon after. As no\r\nmore seemed to be forthcoming, the search was relinquished in 1816.\r\nA fifth was found in 1845, and nearly five hundred since. Since 1891\r\nphotography has been wondrously serviceable in finding these bodies.\r\nA sensitive plate, on being exposed toward that part of the sky which\r\nit is desired to examine, will record all the perceptible stars as\r\nround disks; while any planets that appear in the field of view will,\r\nby their motion, leave their trace in the form of elongated trails or\r\nstreaks, thus betraying themselves at once on the photographs. In this\r\nway Charlois, of Nice, Italy, has found nearly ninety small planets.\r\nAll these planetoids, as the minor planets are often termed, are quite\r\nsmall, being but twenty to one hundred miles in diameter, and not\r\nconsequential members of the solar system. Bode’s law thus fulfilled\r\nits temporary mission; but egregiously failed when Neptune claimed\r\nadmission to a place in the solar system, for its distance from the sun\r\nwas utterly out of harmony with that required by the law of Bode.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. HOW NEPTUNE WAS FOUND.\r\n\r\nThe patience of Job had a strong parallel in the labors of those\r\ntireless toilers to whose minute computations we owe our knowledge of\r\nNeptune’s path in the skies. For this far-off planet was discovered\r\nnot by the use of a telescope, or any optical instrument, but simply\r\nby a process of mathematical reasoning. The story is simply this. For\r\nsixty years after Uranus was recognized, there were irregularities in\r\nits motion that could not be satisfactorily accounted for. In the orbit\r\nthat it was believed to pursue, it was sometimes in advance of its\r\nproper position, and sometimes it seemed to fall behind. Sometimes it\r\nappeared to be drawn a little to the right, and at other times as far\r\nthe other way.\r\n\r\nThe thought at last came separately to several penetrating minds, not\r\nthat the observations of its position were in error, but that Uranus\r\nmust be drawn away from its supposed path by the attraction exercised\r\nupon it by some unseen body. And if such an object existed, was it\r\na planet? Where was it? How large was it? What was its path in the\r\nfar-off ether?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MOVEMENT OF URANUS AND NEPTUNE.\r\n\r\nThe inner circle shows the position of Uranus at various dates; the\r\nouter circle the position of Neptune. The arrows show the direction\r\ntoward which Uranus was drawn.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1842, the Royal Society of Sciences of Göttingen proposed\r\nas a prize question the full discussion of the theory of the motions\r\nof Uranus. It was specially sought to learn the cause of the large\r\nand increasing error of Bouvard’s Tables that had been relied upon to\r\nshow its motion and its precise position at any time. Several able\r\nmathematicians undertook this intricate problem. Among them were\r\nJohn C. Adams, of Cambridge University, England, Sears C. Walker,\r\nof Washington, a man whose sad fate it was to pass away ere his\r\nmagnificent abilities could receive extended recognition, and M. Le\r\nVerrier, of Paris. Working unknown to each other, they reached similar\r\nconclusions almost at the same time. Though not the first to solve\r\nthe problem, the brilliant Frenchman was the first to announce his\r\nresult, which he did by writing a letter to Dr. Galle, of the Berlin\r\nObservatory, where there was one of the largest telescopes in Europe,\r\nand asking him to search for his computed planet, and assigning its\r\nsupposed place in the heavens. The very night he received the letter\r\nDr. Galle found the planet within one degree of the point designated.\r\nThe next night it had moved one minute of space, and was also seen to\r\nhave a perceptible disk. This settled the question, and stamped it as\r\na planet. Le Verrier well merited the title bestowed upon him, “First\r\nastronomer of the age.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. METEORITES.\r\n\r\nThe nineteenth century will be forever memorable for its witnessing\r\nthe closing career and final destruction of a famous comet. First\r\nnoticed in France, in 1772, and rediscovered, in 1826, by an Austrian\r\nofficer named Biela, it bears his name. His computation showed that it\r\ntraversed its orbit in six and one half years. When it reappeared in\r\n1846, and again in 1852, it was seen to have split into two unequal\r\nfragments. It has not been seen since; but at every time when its\r\nreturn should have taken place the earth has passed through showers of\r\nmeteors supposed to be its constituent particles, and to indicate its\r\nentire disintegration.\r\n\r\nDuring the meteoric shower of 1885, on the 27th of November, a large\r\niron meteorite fell in Mazapil, Mexico, and chemical and physical\r\ninvestigation joined to pronounce it a part of the lost Biela’s comet.\r\n\r\nThe large cabinets of the world contain hundreds of specimens of\r\nmeteorites, known to be such by their chemical composition, but only\r\na few have actually been seen to fall. The most remarkable fall ever\r\nwitnessed was that of May 10, 1879, in Iowa, in which the heaviest\r\nstone weighed 437 pounds. On April 8, 1893, an aerolite fell near\r\nOsawatomie, Kansas, and struck the monument to John Brown that had\r\nbeen erected through the efforts of Horace Greeley in 1863. The meteor\r\nbroke off the left arm of the statue. A Texas meteorite, owned by Yale\r\nUniversity, weighs 1635 pounds. A meteorite that fell in Jiminez, in\r\n1892, now deposited in the city of Mexico, weighs twenty tons; and one\r\nlying on the coast of Labrador, which it is proposed to bring to the\r\nUnited States, is said to be still more massive.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. DO METEORS OFTEN STRIKE THE EARTH?\r\n\r\nIt must not be thought that meteors usually strike the earth. In truth,\r\nbut few of them do. The earth is surrounded by them, cold, dark,\r\ninvisible, because unillumined. It is only when they become heated by\r\nrapidly impinging on the atmosphere that they can be seen at all; and\r\nunless they come near enough to become subject to the dominant power of\r\nthe earth’s attraction, they pass off into space unnoticed, and their\r\npresence unsuspected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAMES H. COFFIN,\r\n\r\nLate Professor of Astronomy, Lafayette College, Easton, Pa.]\r\n\r\nA case in point is the brilliant “fire-ball” of July 20, 1860, that\r\nmoved rapidly over the United States, from Wisconsin to Cape Cod, and\r\nthen passed off into the skies. The entire time of its visible flight\r\nover a path of thirteen hundred miles was about two minutes. It was\r\nseen about ten o’clock in the evening. It was estimated to be from one\r\nhundred to five hundred feet in diameter, allowing for an increase as\r\nit expanded by reason of its striking with such velocity the lower\r\nand denser layers of the air. Its size and brilliancy were such as to\r\narrest the attention of hundreds of persons, some of whom crouched in\r\nfear, and even alleged that they heard it hiss as it flew over their\r\nheads. Some fishermen in Lake Huron had ropes over the sides of their\r\nboat, ready to spring into the water if it came too near.\r\n\r\nJames H. Coffin, LL. D., then Professor of Astronomy in Lafayette\r\nCollege, made an exhaustive study of this unusual phenomenon, and,\r\nunder the patronage of the Smithsonian Institution, published a volume\r\ncontaining many observations that he collected, with the mathematical\r\nresults derived from them. Professor J. Hann, of Vienna, the highest\r\nauthority on this subject, said that it was the most comprehensive\r\nstudy of a meteor’s path ever accomplished. Six years were spent in\r\nmaking the computations.\r\n\r\nSelf-illumined by the heat evolved in striking the various layers of\r\nthe earth’s atmosphere, it became sufficiently bright to be first seen\r\nwhen seventy miles above the surface of the earth. It was within forty\r\nmiles of touching us at the time it was over the Hudson River, when\r\nthe great heat acquired by its rapid transit caused it to burst into\r\ntwo masses, which—like Biela’s comet—continued to pursue separate\r\ncourses, side by side, until they were lost to view in their ascending\r\nflight, being last seen from the deck of a vessel off the island of\r\nNantucket.\r\n\r\nNo part of the fire-ball struck the earth. Its orbit was an hyperbola,\r\na curve not often found in nature, such that it can never come near us\r\nagain unless, by the superior attraction of some celestial body, its\r\ncourse may be changed, and a new orbit result.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATORIES.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Observatory, at Greenwich, England, was founded by Charles\r\nthe Second in 1675. Its main purpose was to extend astronomical\r\nknowledge, so that navigators might better find the position of\r\ntheir ships at sea. This institution retains its prominence. All the\r\nlongitudes on our maps are reckoned from it, and Greenwich time is used\r\non every ship that traverses the ocean. The “Nautical Almanac,” issued\r\nby the Observatory, was an indispensable part of the outfit of every\r\nsea captain until, in 1852, the United States provided its own American\r\nEphemeris, a collection of tables of the motions and places of the\r\nsun, moon, and planets for every day and hour, and occultations of the\r\nstars, with rules for calculating longitude and the like.\r\n\r\nMany valuable observations of the transit of Venus in 1769 were made\r\nat points near Philadelphia; but almost seventy years ensued before\r\nAmerica witnessed the erection of any permanent buildings devoted to\r\nthe purposes of this science.\r\n\r\nPresident John Quincy Adams, who was highly versed in science, and held\r\nthe position of president of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences\r\nin Boston for twenty years, often urged this matter on the attention of\r\nCongress, but without success.\r\n\r\nPresident Thomas Jefferson, who was also a man of no small scientific\r\ninformation, as evidenced in his keeping a systematic weather record\r\nat his home in Monticello, Virginia, proposed an elaborate survey of\r\nthe national coast. This was authorized by Congress in 1807. In the\r\nyear 1832, in reviving an act for the continuance of the Coast Survey,\r\nCongress was careful to append the proviso “that nothing in the act\r\nshould be construed to authorize the erection or maintenance of a\r\npermanent astronomical observatory.”\r\n\r\nThe expected return of Halley’s comet in 1835 again stimulated popular\r\ninterest in the science, and aroused an intense desire to provide\r\nserviceable instruments, and to establish buildings suitable for\r\ntheir care and use. To Williams College, Massachusetts, belongs the\r\nhonor of erecting, in 1836, the first astronomical observatory on\r\nthis continent. Under its revolving dome was mounted an Herschelian\r\ntelescope of ten feet focus, which later became the property of\r\nLafayette College, where it is still preserved. In 1843, John Quincy\r\nAdams laid the corner-stone of the Longworth Observatory in Cincinnati,\r\nand delivered a commemorative address, his last great oration. The\r\nconstruction of the United States Naval Observatory at Washington soon\r\nfollowed, and before 1850 there were fourteen observatories established\r\nin this country. Nearly all the instruments they contained were made\r\nabroad, chiefly in Munich and London. Since then the number has risen\r\nto two hundred recognized observatories, of which twenty-four are of\r\nsuperior order, where systematic work is daily pursued, and the results\r\nare regularly published in book form. About two hundred observatories\r\nexist in other nations.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. IMPROVED INSTRUMENTS; THEIR EFFECT ON THE SCIENCE.\r\n\r\nThe great improvements in telescopes made during the century have been\r\nfruitful in two ways; a better knowledge of the surface of the moon and\r\nof the planets has been gained, and we have been enabled to learn with\r\nprecision the exact motions and times of revolution of these bodies\r\nand of their accompanying moons. This information, by the use of the\r\nlaws ascertained by Kepler and La Place, gives us their exact distance,\r\ndimensions, and mass. With the increase of telescopic power, the census\r\nof the starry host has been so augmented that the number of stars\r\nwithin reach of our modern instruments exceeds 125,000,000. But we had\r\ngone little beyond this sort of information until the invention of the\r\nspectroscope.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the year 1859 a few meteors, composed chiefly of stone\r\nor iron, some of which had been actually seen to fall from the sky,\r\nhad been subjected to chemical analysis; but outside of this naught\r\nwas known of the physical constitution of other worlds than ours. Our\r\nignorance on this point was complete. All our attempts to become better\r\nacquainted with the structure of the planets, the composition of the\r\nsun, and the nature of the fixed stars would probably have been in vain\r\nbut for the invention of the spectroscope. This surprising instrument\r\nis a master-key with which to unlock many of Nature’s mysteries; her\r\nrecesses are brought to view, and the farthest star is subjected to an\r\naccurate chemical analysis, so far as the light that comes from it is\r\nsufficient to disclose the materials of which it is composed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LICK OBSERVATORY, MOUNT HAMILTON, CALIFORNIA.]\r\n\r\nThe wondrous use of electricity as an agent for the production of\r\nlight, heat, and power is no greater achievement, in its way, than is\r\nSpectrum Analysis in bringing to our earthly laboratories the work of\r\nthe Divine Hand performed in distant regions of space. Yet the story\r\nof the spectroscope is easily told. In its essential elements it is\r\nmerely this: A ray of light, entering a darkened room through a hole\r\nin the window shutter, produces a bright beam on the opposite wall. A\r\ntriangular glass prism held close to the crevice turns this beam into a\r\nband of rainbow hues. If the hole can be changed into a small slit, say\r\none fourth of an inch high and one fiftieth of an inch wide, and if the\r\nlight can further be made to pass in succession through several prisms,\r\ninstead of through one, the band will be so elongated thereby that its\r\nvarious and surprising markings can be thoroughly traced and fully\r\nstudied.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SPECTROSCOPE.]\r\n\r\nTo this band of bright colors Sir Isaac Newton gave the name of the\r\nsolar spectrum. The image formed by the light of any luminous body,\r\nafter it has passed through a prism, is said to be the spectrum of that\r\nbody.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. THE SPECTROSCOPE AND ITS TRIUMPHS.\r\n\r\nThe spectroscope consists essentially of three tubes joined in the\r\nform of the letter Y, one of which is a small telescope, in the focus\r\nof which a narrow slit is placed to admit the ray of light that is to\r\nbe examined; a prism, or a ruled grating that disperses the light, so\r\nas to form a spectrum; and a view telescope, with which to observe the\r\nvarious parts of the spectrum.\r\n\r\nBy using a small telescope to view the spectrum of the sun, Fraunhofer,\r\na German optician, in 1814, discovered that the whole length of\r\nthe spectrum was crowded with dark lines, very narrow, indeed, but\r\nscattered all through the seven hues. He found that sunlight, whether\r\ntaken directly or reflected from clouds or from the moon or planets,\r\ninvariably gave the same spectrum; but in no case did light from the\r\nstars give a spectrum of the same sort as that from the sun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YERKES TELESCOPE, UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO.\r\n\r\nLargest in the World.]\r\n\r\nDr. Kirchhoff, of Heidelberg, in 1859, explained the origin of the\r\ndark lines, and showed that there are three kinds of spectra: first,\r\nthat of an incandescent solid or liquid, which is always perfectly\r\ncontinuous, showing neither dark lines nor bright; second, the spectrum\r\nof a glowing gas, which consists of bright lines or bands separated by\r\ndark spaces. These lines are characteristic of the chemical elements\r\nthat cause them; and so, from the composition of the bright lines in\r\na spectrum, it is possible to tell their origin. Third, a spectrum\r\ncrossed by dark lines; which occurs when an incandescent solid is\r\nviewed through absorbent vapors.\r\n\r\nIn the solar eclipse of 1868, M. Janssen first noticed that the solar\r\nprominences gave a spectrum of the second kind, and thus proved that\r\nthe prominences consist of glowing gas. Since that time the march of\r\ndiscovery has been exceedingly rapid.\r\n\r\nThis simple instrument has thus led the way to a knowledge of the\r\nelements composing every heavenly body, no matter what its distance,\r\nprovided only it is giving out light intense enough to reach our gaze.\r\nFor the perfection both of the telescope and spectroscope we owe\r\nmuch to the optical skill and mechanical dexterity of the Clarks and\r\nRowland, Hastings and Brashear, all Americans.\r\n\r\nAbout forty chemical elements have now been recognized in the sun.\r\nThe most prominent are iron, calcium, hydrogen, nickel, and sodium.\r\nA distortion, or displacement, of some of the lines in the spectrum\r\nenables us to calculate the speed at which the gases are rushing toward\r\nor from us. A given line in the spectrum of Aldebaran is displaced\r\ntoward the violet in such a way as to show that the star is approaching\r\nthe sun at the rate of thirty miles a second; while a similar line, in\r\nthe case of Altair, so deviates toward the red end of the spectrum as\r\nto prove that it is receding from the solar system at a velocity of\r\ntwenty-four miles a second. By this principle, recognized by Doppler in\r\n1842, the motions of about one hundred stars toward or from the solar\r\nsystem have been ascertained.\r\n\r\nThere is no question but that the solar system, as a whole, is steadily\r\nmoving away from Sirius, and toward the constellation of Hercules;\r\nwhether faster than at a rate of twelve miles every second is still\r\nscarcely decided; but this rate would be about a million miles a day,\r\nor three hundred and seventy million miles a year.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. WHAT IS DONE IN A LARGE OBSERVATORY; ITS WORK.\r\n\r\nA visitor who wants to know what is done in a great observatory might\r\ngo to Harvard some evening. He would probably find the large refractor\r\npointed toward the satellites of Jupiter, Uranus, or Neptune, with a\r\nview of noting their precise places, so as to compute tables of their\r\nexact motions; or he might find a laborious observer watching such\r\ndouble stars as have considerable proper motion, and making drawings of\r\nconspicuous nebulæ, so that future astronomers may be able to decide\r\nwhether time has wrought any changes in their constitution or figure.\r\nThe great glass at Princeton, under the charge of Professor Charles A.\r\nYoung, is largely used for spectroscopic work, examining the sun’s\r\nphotosphere by day, and noting the spectra of the stars at night.\r\nSpectral observation is an important part of the routine at the Yerkes\r\nObservatory in Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nMany faint comets have been successfully photographed at the Lick\r\nObservatory, on Mount Hamilton, California, and elsewhere by the use of\r\nvery sensitive plates and a long exposure.\r\n\r\nS. W. Burnham, of Chicago, is famed for his acuteness of vision, tested\r\nin having detected and measured over one thousand double stars which\r\nto other eyes had appeared only as single stars. The discovery of\r\nthese objects belongs wholly to the nineteenth century; for in 1803,\r\nSir William Herschel first announced the existence of sidereal systems\r\ncomposed of two stars, one revolving around the other, or both moving\r\nabout a common centre. Some of these binary systems have periods of as\r\ngreat a length as fifteen hundred years; and some are as brief as four,\r\nand even two days. Some of them afford curious instances of contrasted\r\ncolors, the larger star red or orange, and the smaller star blue or\r\ngreen.\r\n\r\n\r\nX. THE NATIONAL OBSERVATORY AT WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PROFESSOR WILLIAM HARKNESS,\r\n\r\nAstronomical Director U. S. Naval Observatory, Washington, D. C.]\r\n\r\nProfessor William Harkness, U. S. N., M. D., LL. D., is widely known\r\nas the author of numerous astronomical and physical papers and books.\r\nHe has also designed a number of instruments and made important\r\ndiscoveries. He has long been connected with the United States Naval\r\nObservatory, and now holds the position of Astronomical Director. His\r\nreport for the year 1898 shows that the twenty-six inch reflector at\r\nWashington is now nightly engaged in mapping the relative positions of\r\nRhea and Iapetus, the fifth and eighth satellites of Saturn, with the\r\nintention of securing a new and final determination of the mass of that\r\nplanet, which has been heretofore reckoned as one 3492d of the sun.\r\nThe twelve-inch telescope is chiefly employed in studying comets and\r\nasteroids, and on Thursday evenings is at the service of the public. In\r\nthe year 1898, 3778 observations were made with the nine-inch transit\r\ncircle, for which two men were detailed, with the services of five\r\ncomputers.\r\n\r\nA transit circle and an altazimuth instrument, each turned out of\r\nsolid steel, have recently been added to the equipment, and are of a\r\nworkmanship that compares favorably with anything ever manufactured\r\nin Europe. It is asserted that the latter instrument will give more\r\naccurate measurements of declination than a transit circle, which is an\r\ninnovation on long-cherished ideas.\r\n\r\nProfessor Simon Newcomb, of the United States Navy, is about to\r\nissue new tables of Mars, Uranus, and Neptune, and a “Catalogue of\r\nFundamental Stars for the Epoch 1900.” During the year 1898 three\r\nthousand copies of the American Nautical Almanac were published. This\r\nis but an illustration of the scientific labor accomplished at this\r\nbusy hive of industry. During the year this observatory issued to\r\nthe navy 230 chronometers, 200 sextants and octants, and 1400 other\r\nnautical instruments of value.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI. STAR MAPS AND CATALOGUES.\r\n\r\nIn the year 128 B. C. Hipparchus put out a catalogue of 1025 stars\r\nobserved at Rhodes. Twenty such works succeeded this up to the year\r\n1801, when Lalande, of Paris, brought out a list of 47,390 stars. It\r\nwill be remembered that few stars have names, except those known to the\r\nArabians of old, but are designated by their positions in the heavens.\r\nIt is customary to refer to them by their declinations and right\r\nascensions, as so many degrees north or south of the celestial equator,\r\nand so many degrees, or hours, east of the vernal equinox—fifteen\r\ndegrees being the equivalent of an hour of right ascension—just like\r\nthe latitude and longitude of cities on a common globe.\r\n\r\nDuring the nineteenth century many celestial atlases and astronomical\r\ncatalogues have been published. These contain lists of comets and\r\nnebulæ, and the places of the double stars and of the fixed stars. Of\r\nthe latter alone over one hundred have appeared, of which Argelander’s\r\nis by far the largest, as it contains the places of more than 310,000\r\nstars. The catalogue prepared by the British Association in 1845 is\r\nof great value, containing 8377 stars. Yarnall’s, of 10,658 stars,\r\npublished in Washington in 1873, is most accessible to us.\r\n\r\nProfessor C. H. F. Peters, of the Hamilton College Observatory,\r\nClinton, N. Y., the discoverer of so many asteroids, has prepared a\r\nvaluable series of star charts. By dividing the heavens into small\r\nsquares and carefully photographing each of them, the places of a vast\r\nnumber of stars can be recorded with far greater accuracy than by the\r\nold plan of a separate instrumental measurement of the position of the\r\nstars. By the use of microscopes the determination of their positions\r\ncan be made with precision. These plates are preserved with care, and\r\nwhen those of the same region of the skies, made in different years,\r\nare compared, any variation in the relative positions of the objects\r\ncan be detected with certainty. The perfection of this method of\r\nstar-mapping is justly deemed one of the most important achievements of\r\nthe century.\r\n\r\nFor an amateur star-gazer who is not provided with a set of maps,\r\nWhitall’s Planisphere is a very ready aid, as it can be instantly\r\nadjusted to any day and hour. The inexperienced, and those who have no\r\ninstruments, can use it with ease and satisfaction to locate a thousand\r\nof the most conspicuous stars.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII. ASTRONOMICAL BOOKS AND THEIR WRITERS.\r\n\r\nIn England this attractive study has been popularized chiefly by the\r\ninteresting works of the two Herschels, who were voluminous writers,\r\nthe lectures of Proctor, and the admirable compend of facts so\r\nassiduously gathered by G. F. Chambers in his delightful treatise on\r\nastronomy.\r\n\r\nIn our own country the heights of theoretical astronomy have been\r\nscaled by such minds as Benjamin Pierce, the profound mathematician of\r\nHarvard University; James C. Watson, of Ann Arbor, whose early death\r\nwas a great loss to science; and Simon Newcomb, the genial savant\r\nof Washington. Chauvenet and Loomis have taught us the meaning of\r\npractical astronomy; and Olmsted, Young, Todd, and not a few others of\r\ndistinction have prepared text-books that fully present the elements of\r\nthe science.\r\n\r\nNor is this fascinating study limited to the students of the 484\r\ncolleges and universities of the land. The last report of the United\r\nStates Commissioner of Education shows that in the public and private\r\nhigh schools of the nation there are over nine thousand boys and\r\nsixteen thousand girls pursuing the study of astronomy.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII. THE PRACTICAL USES OF ASTRONOMY AS AN AID TO NAVIGATION AND\r\nGEODESY.\r\n\r\nThe practical value of this science is best appreciated by the\r\nnavigator, who sees in the sun and moon his clock, and in the stars and\r\nplanets the ready means of learning his latitude and longitude. It is\r\none of the first tasks of the midshipman to become familiar with the\r\nuse of the sextant, by which he works out the problem of ascertaining\r\nthe exact place of the ship upon the ocean. Navigation is helpless\r\nwithout the assistance of astronomy. Yet it is only the A, B, C of the\r\nscience that the sailor has any use for; its higher mysteries are away\r\nbeyond his needs and of no practical profit to him.\r\n\r\nNathaniel Bowditch, of Salem, Mass., in 1802, issued a book entitled\r\n“The New American Practical Navigator,” which is still a standard\r\ntreatise for seamen. His rare acquirements as a mathematician were\r\nsignally displayed, and in a form that has proved enduring, when, in\r\n1814–17, he translated into English, accompanied with copious notes of\r\nhis own, the profound work, “Celestial Mechanics,” penned by the gifted\r\nLa Place in 1799. Although in name a translation of a foreign book with\r\na commentary, it is in many respects an original work. Professor Elias\r\nLoomis, who left to Yale University three hundred thousand dollars as\r\nan endowment fund to aid in prosecuting astronomical research, said of\r\nhim, in 1850, “Bowditch has probably done more for the improvement of\r\nphysical astronomy than all other Americans combined.” Dr. Bowditch\r\npublished the work in four ponderous quarto volumes wholly at his own\r\nprivate cost. These volumes he did not expose for sale, but generously\r\ngave them to such persons as proved to him their ability to appreciate\r\nand comprehend them. This outlay impaired the fortunes of his family,\r\nbut became his own unique monument.\r\n\r\nThis work remains one of the most profound efforts of mathematical\r\nresearch on record. Bowditch’s accuracy has passed into a proverb.\r\nHe gave the latitude of all the principal seaports of the world with\r\nmarked precision; while some of the longitudes are now found to be\r\nslightly in error, it is surprising that his determinations of those of\r\nBoston and Philadelphia should be exactly the same as those obtained by\r\nthe best methods in use to-day. But he makes San Francisco and Halifax\r\nseven miles too far to the east, and New York eight miles too far west.\r\nBut we are to remember that for this computation the best available\r\ninstruments were the chronometers of a century ago, and that lunar\r\nobservations were made with the old-time sextant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ZENITH TELESCOPE.\r\n\r\nMade for University of Pennsylvania by Warner & Swasey.]\r\n\r\nAs applied to geodesy, astronomy has added a process of ascertaining\r\ngeographical latitude with marvelous accuracy and speed by the use of\r\nthe zenith telescope, an instrument devised by Major Talcott in 1835.\r\nThis instrument can be set in a vertical direction with ease, and be\r\npointed alternately to two stars that cross the meridian at a brief\r\ninterval of time, the one north and the other south of the zenith.\r\nDifficulties that arise from refraction are avoided, and the resulting\r\nlatitude is quickly computed. This method is largely employed in the\r\nsurveys of the public lands, as also in establishing the boundary\r\nbetween the United States and British America.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV. NOTABLE EPOCHS IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\nWorth marking as epochs of the nineteenth century were such dates\r\nas October 10, 1846, when the first determination of difference of\r\nlongitude of two places was made by the use of the telegraph wire.\r\nSears C. Walker, in Washington, and E. Otis Kendall, in Philadelphia,\r\ncompared their clocks by interchanging telegraphic signals, and thus\r\nfound their respective longitudes.\r\n\r\nIn 1850, Professor William C. Bond, of Harvard College, invented the\r\nchronograph. Through the urgency of Sir David Brewster, it was shown\r\nin the great exhibition of that year in London, where a medal was\r\nawarded for it. The chronograph was speedily adopted throughout Europe,\r\nand together with other apparatus made by Bond constituted what there\r\nbecame known as the “American method” of recording observations.\r\nThrough it the errors for which the “personal equation” is a partial\r\nremedy are largely eliminated, and a superior definiteness of record is\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nOn August 7, 1869, the first application of the spectroscope to\r\nthe examination of the corona of the sun was the beginning of the\r\nrevelation of the inner mysteries of the constitution and activities\r\nof the great luminary. The transit of Venus that occurred on December\r\n6, 1882, was fruitful in measurements, by which the estimates of the\r\ndistance of the sun were reduced from the long-accepted figures, 95 to\r\n92 millions of miles. Yet this loss of three millions of miles resulted\r\nfrom the apparently trifling change of reckoning the sun’s parallax at\r\n8.82″, instead of 8.57″. An occurrence of vast practical advantage to\r\nthe whole nation was that of November 18, 1883, when the four standard\r\nmeridians of railroad time were adopted and put into use. From that\r\nday the clocks of the Union were set to keep either Eastern, Central,\r\nMountain, or Pacific Coast time.\r\n\r\nProfessor Edward E. Barnard had used the magnificent telescope of\r\nthirty-six inches aperture, belonging to the Lick Observatory in\r\nCalifornia, but a short time before he astonished the world by\r\ndiscovering a fifth satellite of Jupiter, although it appeared as but\r\na faint speck of light. Besides other honors for this achievement, in\r\n1894 the French Academy of Sciences awarded him the Arago medal, of the\r\nvalue of a thousand francs, a distinction given but twice before, first\r\nto Le Verrier, for the discovery of Neptune in 1846, and to Asaph Hall,\r\nfor finding the two moons of Mars in 1877.\r\n\r\n“Personal equation” is the name given to the amount of error to which\r\nany person is habitually liable in attempting to note the time of a\r\nfixed occurrence. When the astronomer looks at a star passing the\r\ncross-wires of his transit, he is likely to make the record one or\r\ntwo tenths of a second after the true time, or possibly a like small\r\namount of time before the actual occurrence, by anticipation. This is\r\nnot a matter of wrong intention, nor due to willfulness. But in precise\r\nobservations, especially where comparisons are to be made between the\r\nrecords of several persons, the “personal equation” must be determined,\r\nif possible, and allowed for. Various methods of correcting this\r\ninaccuracy have been used. But the best is that of Frank H. Bigelow,\r\nof the Nautical Almanac Office, Washington, who, in 1890, devised a\r\nprocess of taking star transits by photography. It entirely does away\r\nwith this source of error, and has proved of great value.\r\n\r\n\r\nXV. DISCARDED DOCTRINES AND ABANDONED IDEAS.\r\n\r\nA few generations ago an eight-day clock was to be found only in the\r\nhomes of well-to-do people, and a gold watch was a symbol of wealth,\r\nsuch as to subject its wearer to a special tax. In this age of dollar\r\nclocks and Waterbury watches, almanacs are no longer indispensable. We\r\ndo not regulate our time-pieces by the rising and setting of the sun;\r\nnor can a future Jay Gould lay the foundation of his fortune, as did\r\nthe one best known by that name, by setting up rural noon-marks for a\r\nfixed fee.\r\n\r\nSome pleasant dreams of past decades have vanished in the light of\r\nrecent knowledge. The nebular hypothesis, that wondrous conception of\r\nSwedenborg, elaborated by La Place and espoused by William Herschel and\r\nso many others, as affording a full explanation of the method by which\r\nour worlds were shaped into their present forms, has ceased to have\r\ngeneral acceptance. M. Maedler, director of the Dorpat Observatory in\r\n1846, had a firm persuasion that the collective body of stars visible\r\nto us has a movement of revolution about a centre situated in the group\r\nof the Pleiades, and corresponding to the star Alcyone. But this notion\r\nof a central sun around which all the solar system is circling has lost\r\nground.\r\n\r\nThe distortion in the orbit of the planet Mercury has been accounted\r\nfor by the urgent suggestion that there must be some planet, as yet\r\nundiscovered, that disturbs the regularity of Mercury’s movements, but\r\nwhose orbit is so near to the sun as to baffle all ordinary efforts to\r\nsee it. It has received, by anticipation, the prenatal name of Vulcan.\r\nMany eyes have peered most intently into the region indicated, and\r\nsome few have imagined they had found what they sought. A physician\r\nof the village of Orgeres, France, M. Lescarbault by name, on March\r\n20, 1859, saw such an object pass over the sun’s disk. The skillful Le\r\nVerrier was much impressed by this physician’s minute account of the\r\noccurrence. But there was no confirmation of the alleged discovery.\r\nAt the time of subsequent eclipses that part of the heavens has been\r\nrepeatedly examined closely, but in vain. So we must wait longer before\r\nbelieving that Vulcan does exist.\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1877, Professor Hall, through the powerful telescope at\r\nWashington, saw that Mars was attended by two tiny satellites, he put a\r\npermanent injunction on the further use of the once favorite phrase,\r\n\r\n    “The snowy poles of moonless Mars.”\r\n\r\nAnd so of the question oft discussed in the old-time debating\r\nsocieties, “Are the planets inhabited?” It may still be left in the\r\nhands of young collegians, notwithstanding the fact that our largest\r\ntelescopes give only negative testimony.\r\n\r\nIn a solar eclipse in February, 1736, that was annular in shape, just\r\nbefore the sun was completely hidden, the narrow horn of light seemed\r\nto break into a series of dots, or luminous points, which, when noted\r\nagain a century later and described by Francis Baily, received the\r\nname of “Baily Beads.” It was attempted to explain this as caused by\r\nthe moon’s mountains cutting off the last rays of sunlight, or else as\r\nproduced by irradiation. But with the advent of stronger telescopic\r\npower the phenomenon has come to an end.\r\n\r\nDavid Rittenhouse, of Norristown, whom Thomas Jefferson considered\r\n“second to no astronomer living,” built an orrery worth a thousand\r\ndollars, to illustrate mechanically the motions of all the planets,\r\nand though the instrument is still treasured in the University of\r\nPennsylvania, and its duplicate at Princeton, among the relics of a\r\npast age, it is assigned to the category of toys. Mural circles, much\r\ndepended upon to measure the declination of heavenly bodies, have\r\nfallen into disuse, supplanted by improved transit instruments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THREE-INCH TRANSIT, BY WARNER & SWASEY.]\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI. PROBLEMS FOR FUTURE STUDY.\r\n\r\nMany problems are in store for the future. The field for research still\r\nopens wide. How the solar activity is to be maintained was answered by\r\nNewton in the suggestion that comets falling into it kept up its supply\r\nof matter and energy. Waterston, in 1853, propounded the thought that\r\nmeteoric matter may be the aliment of the sun. Now the prevalent theory\r\nis that a contraction of the sun’s volume, constantly in progress,\r\nbut so slight as to be invisible to the most powerful telescope, is\r\ncompetent to furnish a heat supply equal to all that can have been\r\nemitted during historic periods.\r\n\r\nProfessor Newcomb answers the question, “How long will the sun endure?”\r\nby saying, “The physical conclusion to which we are led by a study of\r\nthe laws of nature is that the sun, like a living being, must have a\r\nbirth and will have an end. From the known amount of heat which it\r\nradiates we can, even in a rude way, calculate the probable length of\r\nits life. From fifteen to twenty millions of years seems to be the\r\nlimit of its age in the past, and it may exist a few millions of years,\r\nperhaps five or ten, in the future.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAROLUS LINNÆUS OF SWEDEN, FATHER OF MODERN BOTANY.\r\n\r\n  This illustration was prepared by a Swedish society, and represents\r\n    the famous botanist after his return from the exploration of\r\n    Lapland, and with a bunch of his favorite flower (_Linnæa\r\n    borealis_) in his hand.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTORY OF PLANT AND FLOWER\r\n\r\nBY THOMAS MEEHAN,\r\n\r\n_Vice President Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia_.\r\n\r\n\r\nBotany, in its general sense, signifies the knowledge of plants. In the\r\nearlier periods of human history plants appealed to mankind as material\r\nfor food or medicine; and down to comparatively recent times botanical\r\nstudies were pursued mainly in these directions. Dioscorides, a Greek,\r\nwho lived in the first century of the Christian era, is the earliest\r\nwriter of whom we have knowledge that can lay a claim to botanical\r\ndistinction, but the medical property of plants was evidently the chief\r\nincentive to his task. It was not until the beginning of the sixteenth\r\ncentury that botany, in its broad sense, became a study, and Le Cluse,\r\na French physician, who died in 1609, may be regarded as one of its\r\npatriarchs. Still the medical uses of plants were steadily kept in\r\nview. The English botanist, John Gerarde, who was a contemporary of Le\r\nCluse, or Clusius, as botanists usually call him, wrote a remarkable\r\nwork on botany,—remarkable for his time,—but this was styled a\r\n“Herbal,” as were other famous botanical works down to the beginning of\r\nthe present century.\r\n\r\nFollowing the year 1700, the knowledge of plants individually became so\r\nextended that systematic arrangement became desirable. The first real\r\nadvance in this direction was made by Carl Von Linné, commonly known by\r\nits Latin form, Linnæus, a Swede, born in 1707, and whose talents for\r\nbotanical acquirements seemed almost innate. In his twenty-third year\r\nhe saw the need of a better system, and commenced at once the great\r\nwork of botanical reform. He saw that plants with a certain number of\r\nstamens and pistils were correlated, and he founded classes and orders\r\non them. Flowers with five stamens or six stamens would belong to\r\nhis class pentandria or hexandria, respectively, and those with five\r\npistils or six pistils pentagynia, or hexagynia, accordingly; and so on\r\nup to polyandria, or polygynia—many stamens or pistils—of which our\r\ncommon buttercup is an illustration. He further showed that two names\r\nonly were all that is necessary to denote any plant, the generic name\r\nand its adjective, as, for instance, _Cornus alba_, the white Dogwood;\r\nand that the descriptions should be brief, covering only the essential\r\npoints wherein one species of plant differed from another. This\r\nbecame known as the sexual system. It fairly electrified intelligent\r\ncircles. People generally took to counting stamens and pistils, and\r\nlarge numbers took pride in being botanists because they could trace\r\nso easily the classes and orders of the plants they met. The grand old\r\nman died in 1778, and though his artificial system had to give way to\r\na more natural method, he is justly regarded as the father of modern\r\nbotany.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GREEN ROSE.\r\n\r\nFlower with leaves for petals.]\r\n\r\nWith the incoming of the nineteenth century, botany took a rapid start.\r\nIt ceased to be a mere handmaid to the study of medicine. Chemistry,\r\ngeography, teleology, and indeed the chief foundations of biology had\r\nbecome closely interwoven with botanical studies; and thus the progress\r\nof botany through the century has to be viewed from many standpoints.\r\n\r\nIn classification, what is known as the natural system has replaced\r\nthe sexual. Plants are grouped according to their apparent\r\nrelationships. Those resembling in general character the Rose form\r\nthe order _Rosaceæ_; the Lily, _Liliaceæ_. Sometimes, however,\r\na striking characteristic is adopted for the family name, as\r\n_Compositæ_, or compound flower, for the daisy and aster-flowered\r\nplants; _Umbelliferæ_, or umbel-flowering, as in carrot or parsley;\r\n_Leguminosæ_, having the seed vessels as legumes, like peas and beans.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEAD OF WHITE CLOVER, WITH A BRANCH FROM THE CENTRE.]\r\n\r\nClassification has, however, derived much assistance from a wholly\r\nnew branch of the science known as Morphology. This teaches that all\r\nparts of plants are modifications of other parts. What Nature may have\r\nintended to be a leaf may become a stem; the outer series of floral\r\nenvelopes, or calyx, may become petals; petals may become stamens;\r\nand even pistils may become leaves, or even branches. The green rose\r\nof the florists is a case in which the leaves that should have been\r\nchanged into petals to form a perfect rose flower have persisted in\r\ncontinuing green leaves, though masquerading as petals; and it is not\r\nunusual to find in the rose cases where the pistils have reverted\r\nto their original destination as the analogue of branches, and have\r\nstarted a growth from the centre of the flower. So in an orange, the\r\ncarpels, or divisions, are metamorphosed primary leaves. Two series of\r\nfive each make the ten divisions. Sometimes the axis starts to make\r\nanother growth, as noted in the rose, but does not get far before it\r\nis arrested, and then we have a small orange inside a larger one, as\r\nin the navel orange. Just the reverse occurs sometimes. The lower\r\nseries is suppressed, and only the upper one develops to a fruiting\r\nstage, when the small red oranges known as the Tangerines are the\r\nresults. Illustrations of these transformations of one organ to another\r\nare frequent if we look for them. The annexed illustration shows a\r\ncondition of the white clover, which, instead of the usual round head,\r\nhas started on as a raceme or spike.\r\n\r\nThese wanderings from general forms were formerly regarded as monsters,\r\nof no particular use to the botanical student, but are now welcomed as\r\nguiding stars to the central features of Morphology. The importance of\r\nthis branch of botany, in connection with classification, can readily\r\nbe seen.\r\n\r\nThe studies in the behavior of plants have made remarkable progress\r\nduring the century, and this also derives much aid from morphology. The\r\nstrawberry sends out runners from which new plants are formed; but,\r\ntiring of this, eventually sends the runner upward to act as a flower\r\nstalk. What might have been but a bunch of leaves and roots at the end\r\nof the runner is now converted into a mass of flowers and pedicels\r\nat the end of a common peduncle. In some cases Nature reverses this\r\nplan. After starting the structure as an erect fruit-bearing stem, it\r\nsends it back to pierce the ground as a root should do. This is well\r\nillustrated by the peanut.\r\n\r\nIn the common _Yucca_, the more tropical species have erect stems;\r\nbut in the form known in gardens as Adam’s needle and thread—_Yucca\r\nfilamentosa_—the erect stem is sent down under the surface of the\r\nground, and is then a rhizome, instead of a caudex, or stem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PEANUT.\r\n\r\nA pod magnified.]\r\n\r\nModification in connection with behavior is further illustrated by\r\nthe grapevine and Virginia creeper. The whole leading shoot is here\r\npushed aside by the development of a bud at the base of the leaf, that\r\ntakes the place of a leading shoot. The original leader then becomes a\r\ntendril, and serves in the economy of the plant by clinging to trees\r\nor rocks, or in coiling around other plants in support. Great progress\r\nhas been made in this department of botany within recent years. Darwin\r\nhas shown that the tendrils of some plants continue in motion for some\r\ntime in order to find something to cling to. The grapevine especially\r\nspends a long time in this labor if there is difficulty in reaching a\r\nhost. The plant preserves vital power all this time, but no sooner is\r\nsupport found, than nutrition is cut off, and the tendril dies, though,\r\nhard and wiry, it serves its parent plant as a support better dead\r\nthan alive. The amount of nutrition spent in sustaining motion is found\r\nto be enormous. A vine that can find ready means of support grows with\r\na much more healthy vigor than one that has difficulty in finding it.\r\nMany plants present illustrations.\r\n\r\nMuch advance has been made in the knowledge of the motions of plants\r\nas regards their various forms. Growth in plants is not continuous;\r\nbut is a series of rests and advances. In other words it is rhythmic.\r\nThe nodes, or knots, in the stems of grasses are resting-places.\r\nWhen a rest occurs, energy may be exerted in a different direction,\r\nand a change of form result. This is well illustrated by the common\r\nDogwood of northern woods, _Cornus florida_ on the eastern, and\r\n_Cornus Nuttallii_ on the western slope of the American continent. On\r\nthe approach of winter the leaf is reduced to a bud scale, and then\r\nrests. When spring returns these scales resume growth and appear as\r\nwhite bracts. In the annexed illustration the scales that served for\r\nwinter protection to the buds are seen at the apex of the bracts. In\r\nother species of Dogwood the bud scales do not resume growth. Energy\r\nis spent in another direction. In this manner we have an insight as to\r\nthe cause of variation, which was not perceived even so recently as\r\nDarwin’s time. We now say that variation results from varying degrees\r\nof rhythmic growth—force; and that this again is governed by varying\r\npowers of assimilation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OUTLINE OF A WHITE DOGWOOD FLOWER (_Cornus florida_),\r\nSHOWING BUD-SCALES DEVELOPED TO BRACTS.]\r\n\r\nThe Darwinian view, that form results from external conditions of which\r\nthe plant avails itself in a struggle for existence, is still widely\r\naccepted as a leading factor in the origin of species. Those which can\r\nassume the strongest weapons of defense continue to exist under the\r\nchanged conditions. The weaker ones do not survive, and we only know of\r\nthem as fossils. This is termed the doctrine of natural selection.\r\n\r\nThe origin and development of plant-life, or, as it is termed,\r\nevolution, has made rapid advancement as a study during the century.\r\nThat there has been an adaptation to conditions in some respects, as\r\ncontended by Mr. Darwin and his followers, must be correct. The oak\r\nand other species of trees must have been formed before mistletoe and\r\nother parasites could grow on them. In the common Dodder—species of\r\n_Cuscuta_—the seeds germinate in the ground like ordinary plants. As\r\nsoon as they find something to attach themselves to, they cut loose\r\nfrom mother earth and live wholly on the host. As a speculation it\r\nseems plausible that all parasites have arisen in this way. Some,\r\nlike the mistletoe, having the power, at length, to have their seeds\r\ngerminate on the host-plant, have left their terrestrial origin in\r\nthe past uncertain. A number of parasites, however, do not seem to\r\nlive wholly on the plants they attach themselves to. These are\r\nusually destitute of green color. The Indian pipe, snow plant of the\r\nPacific Coast, and Squaw root of the Eastern States are examples;\r\nthe former called ghost-flower from its paleness. These plants have\r\nlittle carbonaceous matter in their structure, and hence are regarded\r\nas having formed a kind of partnership with fungi. This is known\r\nnow as symbiosis, or living together of dissimilar organisms, each\r\ndependent mutually. The fungus and the flowering plant in these cases\r\nare necessary to the existence of each other. They demand nitrogen\r\ninstead of carbonhydroids. The Squaw root, _Conopholis Americana_,\r\nthough attached to the subterranean portions of the trunks of trees,\r\nis probably sustained by the fungus material in the old bark, or even\r\nin the wood, rather than by the ordinary food of flowering plants.\r\nLichens, as it is now well known, are a compound of fungi and water\r\nweeds (algæ), and this doctrine of symbiosis is regarded as one of the\r\ngreat advances of the century.\r\n\r\nIt is but fair to say that the doctrine of evolution by the influence\r\nof external conditions in the change of form, though widely accepted\r\nat this time, is not without strong opponents, who point to the\r\noccasional development or suppression of parts on the same plant,\r\nthough the external conditions must be the same. For instance, there\r\nare flowers that have all their parts regular, as in the petals of a\r\nbuttercup; and irregular, as in the snap-dragon or fox-glove. But it\r\nhas been noted that irregular flowers have pendulous stalks, while the\r\nregular ones are usually erect. But once in a while, on the same plant,\r\nflowers normally drooping will become erect. In these cases the flowers\r\nare regular. In the wild snap-dragon or yellow toad-flax, _Linaria\r\nvulgaris_, one of the petals is developed into a long spur; the other\r\nfour petals have, in early life, become connate and transformed into\r\nparts of the flower wholly unlike ordinary petals. But now and then\r\nthe original petals will all develop spurs, resulting in the condition\r\ntechnically known as peloria.\r\n\r\nLinnæus gave this name to this condition because it was supposed to be\r\n“monstrous,” or something opposed to law and order. Through the advance\r\nin morphological botany we have learned to regard it as the result of\r\nsome normal law of development, innate to the plant, and which could\r\nas well be the regular as the occasional condition. In other words,\r\nthere is no reason why Nature might not make the five-spurred flower as\r\ncontinuous in a wild snap-dragon as in a columbine. Many similar facts\r\nare used by those who question the Darwinian law of development.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YELLOW TOAD-FLAX.\r\n\r\nFlower in the peloria state.]\r\n\r\nThat nutrition has more to do in the evolution of form than external\r\nforces has received much aid, as a theory, from the advance during\r\nrecent times of a study of the separate sexes of flowers. On coniferous\r\ntrees, notably the firs, pines, and spruces, the male and female\r\nflowers are produced separately. The female, which finally yield the\r\ncones, are always borne on the most vigorous branches. When these\r\nbranches have their supply of nutrition shortened and become weak, only\r\nmale flowers are produced. On the other hand, branches normally weak\r\nwill at times gain increased strength, and then the male flowers give\r\nfemale ones. This is often seen in corn fields. The generally weak\r\ntassel will have grains of corn through it. It is not infrequent to\r\nfind what should normally be perfect ears on stalks weaker than usual.\r\nIn these cases the upper portion of the ear will have male flowers only.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRAINED CORN-TASSEL.]\r\n\r\nIn connection with the doctrine of development, much attention has been\r\ngiven during the century to fertilization of flowers and the agency of\r\ninsects in connection therewith. On the one hand it is contended that\r\nin all probability the flowers in the earlier periods of the world’s\r\nhistory had neither color nor fragrance. In this condition they were\r\nself-fertilizers, that is, were fecundated by their own pollen. In\r\nmodern phraseology they were in and in breeders. When the struggle for\r\nexistence became necessary, those which could get a cross with outside\r\nraces became more vigorous in their progeny, and thus had an advantage\r\nin the struggle. In brief, without an occasional introduction of new\r\nblood, as it might be termed, there was danger of a race dying out.\r\nTo support this view, Mr. Darwin published the result of a number of\r\nexperiments. Many of them favored either side, but the average was\r\nin favor of the view that crossing was advantageous. Against this it\r\nhas been urged that an average in such cases is not conclusive. If a\r\nnumber, though the minor number of cases, showed superiority by close\r\nbreeding in his limited experiments, a new set of observations might\r\nhave changed the averages, so as to make the minor figures in one\r\ninstance the major in others. Again, it is contended that to increase\r\na plant by other means than by seeds must be the closest kind of\r\nreproduction; yet some plants, coeval with the history of man, have\r\nbeen continued by offsets and are as strong and vigorous as ever. The\r\nBanana is an illustration. Under cultivation it produces only seedless\r\nfruits. It is raised wholly from young suckers or offsets from the\r\nroots. Mythology gives it a prominent place in the Garden of Eden, and\r\nits botanical name, _Musa paradisiaca_, originated in this legend.\r\n\r\nThough much has been recorded in this line to weaken the force of the\r\nspeculations that flowers late in the history of the earth developed\r\ncolor and sweet secretions in order to attract insects to aid in\r\ncross-fertilization, they are strongly supported by the fact that a\r\nlarge number of species, notably of orchids, are seldom fertilized\r\nwithout insect aid in pollination.\r\n\r\nBut there are anomalies even here. Some plants capture and literally\r\neat the insects that should be regarded as their benefactors. These\r\nare classified as insectivorous plants. Some seem to catch the insects\r\nin mere sport, while in the act of conveying pollen to them. These are\r\nknown as cruel plants. There are numerous illustrations of this among\r\nthe families of _Asclepias_ and _Apocynum_, the milk-weed family. In\r\nour gardens a Brazilian climber, _Arauga_, or _Physianthus albens_,\r\nis frequently grown for its waxy flowers and delicious odor, but the\r\ntreacherous blossoms are frequently strung with the insects it has\r\ncaught.\r\n\r\nIn the northern part of America a common wild flower of one of these\r\nfamilies, _Apocynum androsmæfolium_, has this insect-catching habit.\r\nNumerous small insects meet death, and hang to the flowers like scalps\r\nto the wild Indian.\r\n\r\nConsiderable advance has been made in vegetable physiology, though\r\nno one has as yet been able to reach the origin of the life-power in\r\nplants. The power that enables an oak to maintain its huge branches in\r\na horizontal direction, or that can lift or overturn huge rocks, or\r\nsplit them apart as the lightning rifts a tree trunk, is yet unknown.\r\nOn the opposite page is an illustration of a circumstance frequently\r\nobserved, wherein even a delicate root fibre can pierce a potato or\r\nother structures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BANANA FLOWERS.]\r\n\r\nPossibly the greatest botanical advance of the century is in relation\r\nto cryptogamic plants, those low organisms which as mildews and moulds\r\nare most familiar to people generally. As microscopes increase in\r\npower, new forms are discovered. Over forty thousand species have\r\nalready been described, and we may fairly say that there are nearly\r\nhalf as many forms of vegetable life invisible to the naked eye as can\r\nbe seen by our unaided visual organs. Their wants and behaviors are\r\nvery much the same as in the flowering plants or higher orders, as\r\nthey are usually termed. But there is one great difference in this,\r\nthat they feed mainly on nitrogen, and have no use for carbon. They\r\ncare little for light, but yet have an upward tendency under certain\r\nforms, as do those which seek the light. The agarics that revel in\r\nthe darkness of a coal mine, yet curve upward as heartily as a corn\r\nsprout in the open air. Just as in flowering plants, also, they are\r\nmostly innocuous, and indeed many absolutely beneficial to man, a very\r\nsmall portion only being poisonous, or connected with the diseases of\r\nthe human race. Even in these cases their power is closely guarded\r\nby nature. The spores of fungi are found to require such a nice\r\ncombination of conditions before they germinate, that, unless these\r\noccur, they will retain their vegetative power many years in a state\r\nof absolute rest. The mycelium of the mushroom, as the real plant—the\r\ncobwebby portion under ground—only starts to grow when just so many\r\ndegrees of heat, neither more nor less, with just so much moisture, and\r\nthe proper food, are all at hand together; and large numbers are known\r\nto be very select in the kind of food they will make use of at all.\r\nOne genus, known as _Cordyceps_, will only start when the spore comes\r\nin contact with the head of a caterpillar. And various species of the\r\ngenus will avoid a kind of caterpillar that another would enjoy. In our\r\nown country we have one that feeds on the larvae of the May Beetle,\r\nand is known as _Cordyceps Melolonthæ_. In Australia is a very pretty\r\nspecies, which takes on the appearance of the antlers of a deer. This\r\nis known as _Cordyceps Andrewsii_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CRUEL-PLANT.\r\n\r\nButterfly caught in the flower.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD POTATO PENETRATED BY ROOTLET WITH A NEW POTATO.]\r\n\r\nThe most minute of these are known as microbes. They are chiefly\r\ncomposed of a single cell, in the midst of which is the protoplasm, or\r\nmaterial in which life resides, but the exact nature of which is still\r\na mystery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A FUNGUS (_Cordyceps Andrewsii_) GROWING FROM THE HEAD\r\nOF A CATERPILLAR.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most useful and fascinating studies in modern times is\r\nGeographical Botany. It is found to have a close relation to the\r\nhistory of man, and to the changes which have occurred on the surface\r\nof the earth. Plants follow man wherever he wanders; and though every\r\nother trace of man should be abolished on the American continent,\r\nthe plants that came with him from the Old World would enable the\r\nfuture historian to follow his tracks here pretty well. No one has any\r\nhistorical evidence that what is now the Pacific Ocean was once land,\r\nand that the area between the Pacific Ocean and the Mississippi was\r\nonce a huge sea, but botany tells the plain story. Only for botany we\r\nshould not know that the land now serving as the poles was once within\r\nthe tropics; and mainly by fossil gum trees on the American continent,\r\nand the existence still of a few plants common to Australia, have we\r\nthe knowledge of some land connection between these distant shores.\r\nIsland floras, some of the species of which are now found only in\r\nvery limited areas, tell of large tracts submerged of which only the\r\nmountain peaks are left as small islands, lonely in a wide expanse of\r\nwater, while other islands, with only a limited number of well known\r\nspecies, tell of new upheavals within modern times.\r\n\r\nIt is in these lines chiefly that botany has advanced during the\r\ncentury. Herbariums for dry and botanic gardens for living plants are\r\nessential. The latter are not as necessary to the study as formerly, as\r\nthe facilities for travel bring the votaries of the science to distant\r\nplaces in a short time. Nature furnishes the living material for study\r\nat a less outlay of time and money than in the old way of growing\r\nthe plants for the purpose. Few modern botanic gardens have the fame\r\nof those of the past. It is the great Herbarium of Kew, rather than\r\nthe living plants, that makes that famous spot the great school for\r\nbotany to-day. In our own country, the Herbariums of Cambridge, Mass.;\r\nColumbia College, New York; the National at Washington; and that of the\r\nAcademy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, are the most famous in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGRESS OF WOMEN WITHIN THE CENTURY\r\n\r\nBY MARY ELIZABETH LEASE,\r\n\r\n_Ex-President Kansas State Board of Charities_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe whole woman question may be briefly summed up as a century-old\r\nstruggle between conservatism and progress. Women are moving\r\nirregularly, and perhaps illogically, along certain lines of\r\ndevelopment toward a point that will probably be reached; while\r\nconservatism, halting and fearful, is struggling blindly to hold points\r\nand maintain lines that must be given up.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for the rapidity of women’s advancement, women themselves\r\nhave no thoroughness, no clearness, as to the fundamental cause of\r\ntheir grievances or the ends to be attained, and are not yet alive to a\r\nconsciousness of the fact that the question of woman’s rights is simply\r\nand purely a question of human rights, the basic solution of which, on\r\nthe broad plane of justice, will solve all the social, political, and\r\nindustrial problems of which the woman question forms a part.\r\n\r\nThe time when woman suffered silently and toiled patiently without\r\nonce questioning the justice of her lot has happily passed forever.\r\nConfusion and antagonism are engendered because of misunderstanding of\r\nthe real movement. Women are consciously or unconsciously struggling\r\nfor that selfhood which has hitherto been denied them, and are seeking\r\nfor opportunity to develop that personality which Browning, Ruskin,\r\nand other broad thinkers declare “is the good of the race.” The most\r\ndiscouraging feature of the situation is the fact that women as a\r\nwhole do not realize that a politically inferior class is a degraded\r\nclass; a disfranchised class, an oppressed class; and that her economic\r\ndependence upon man is the basic cause of her inferiority.\r\n\r\nThe grievances openly proclaimed by the advocates of woman suffrage\r\nas causes of hostility are too frequently childish, unreasonable, and\r\nunworthy of serious attention. In the majority of cases they centre\r\naround some fancied wrong that is a result rather than a cause. The\r\nkeynote not only to the woman question, but to the labor question may\r\nbe found in the words of that deep thinker and able writer, August\r\nBebel: “The basis of all oppression is economic dependence upon the\r\noppressor.” The widespread discontent with present social conditions\r\nis an augury of hope for the future. There is no element in the unrest\r\nwhich need excite grave apprehension. Thoughtful people perceive\r\nclearly that women are intensely human, nothing more, and that as human\r\nbeings they are entitled not only to food, clothes, and shelter, but to\r\nan opportunity for development.\r\n\r\nIt is only as we are familiar with the oppression that has been the\r\ncommon lot of women since the beginning of time that we can realize\r\nthat her lot has been sweetened, her condition ameliorated, and her\r\nprogress within the century marvelous indeed. The woman question,\r\nhistorically considered, contains all the physical subjugation and\r\nconsequent inferiority which constituted all the differentiation\r\nbetween the physical and mental powers of men and women. It contains\r\nall the humiliation, uncertainty, and ultimate hope of her future.\r\nThe history of the woman question is analogous with the history of\r\nthe labor question, with the difference that woman slavery had its\r\norigin in the peculiarities of her sexual being, while the laborer’s\r\nslavery began when he was robbed of the land which is the birthright\r\nof every human being. It will be seen, therefore, that woman’s slavery\r\nantedates the thralldom of the thrall, and “was more humiliating, more\r\ndegrading, because she was treated and regarded by the laborer as his\r\nservant, his inferior.” This condition largely prevails among laborers\r\nto-day, and was indirectly given utterance to a few weeks ago, when\r\nsome of the members of the American Federation of Labor formulated\r\na traditional resolution demanding that “women be excluded from all\r\npublic work and relegated to the home,”—a demand that would be to\r\nsome extent reasonable, and no doubt acceptable, to the great army of\r\nworking-women, had the chivalrous laborers who formulated the demand\r\nthe ability and industry to provide a home for the women whom they\r\nwould render paupers by deprivation of work, and for the children for\r\nwhom their fathers were unable to provide. It is gratifying to know\r\nthat this resolution was lost in the committee room, and that its\r\nformulation was greeted by the press of the whole country with a storm\r\nof deserved disapproval.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the rapidly increasing number of bread-winners among women\r\nmakes it evident that men are either unable or incompetent to provide\r\nfor them, it remains for the working-women of the country to formulate\r\na resolution demanding that men be excluded from all work that has\r\nhitherto been considered as belonging to or peculiarly adapted to\r\nwomen. What an army of mosquito-legged men from the eating-houses,\r\nlaundries, and dry-goods establishments would rise up to proclaim the\r\nidiocy of women and protest against such injustice!\r\n\r\nOn the threshold of the world’s morning, says a distinguished writer\r\nand worker in the German Reichstag of to-day, we may correctly assume\r\nthat woman was man’s equal in mental and physical power. But she became\r\nhis inferior physically, and consequently dependent upon his bounty,\r\nduring periods of pregnancy, childbirth, and child-rearing, when her\r\nhelplessness forced her to look to him for food and shelter. In the\r\nchildhood of the race might made right; brute strength was the standard\r\nof superiority; the struggle for existence was crude and savage; and\r\nthus this occasional helplessness became the manner of her bondage.\r\n\r\nThat nature is primarily responsible for the centuries of woman’s\r\nenslavement there can be no doubt. And as nature’s laws are unchanging,\r\nthe advocates of woman’s political advancement would do well to\r\nremember that woman’s greatest importance as a public factor can only\r\nbegin when the function of motherhood ceases. “In a real sense, as a\r\nfactory is meant to turn out locomotives or clocks, the machinery of\r\nnature is designed in the last resort to turn out mothers. Life to the\r\nhuman species is not a random series of random efforts; its course is\r\nset as rigidly as the pathway of the stars; its laws are as immutable\r\nas the laws of the Medes and Persians.” (Drummond’s Ascent of Man.)\r\n\r\nNature’s great work for the individual is reproduction and care of the\r\nspecies. The first, Drummond terms the cosmic process; the second,\r\nthe moral process. Statistics show that one child out of every three\r\ndies before maturity, and nature’s task is incomplete unless at least\r\ntwo children be reared to the adult age by every family. Every couple,\r\nthen, at marriage, assumes the responsibility to society and posterity\r\nof bringing three children into the world. Woman’s part in the\r\nstupendous economy of nature is first and distinctively most important,\r\nthat of motherhood. She can only pay her debt to nature, fulfill her\r\nmission to the world, and discharge her obligations to humanity by\r\nfaithfully discharging the duties of motherhood. But as the function\r\nof motherhood ceases when the woman is in the prime of life, ripened\r\nby experience and fortified by maternal ties, she may yet have ample\r\nopportunity to exert her far-reaching influence in public work when\r\nshe has exemplified in her own life the words, Home, Love, Mother. And\r\nthere is, there can be, no rational objection to granting the fullest\r\nsuffrage to woman at this period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARY ELIZABETH LEASE]\r\n\r\nHaving located the basic cause of her dependence, it will be seen that\r\nthe only solution possible for the complete emancipation and mental\r\nand physical development of woman is to render her, through industrial\r\nfreedom, so economically independent in every way of man’s grudging\r\nbounty that she will scorn his pity, resent his abuse, and claim her\r\nright to fullest individuality and opportunity as a human being.\r\n\r\nFor countless ages women were separated from the world by a barrier\r\nas effective as the myriad-miled wall of China; vacillating between\r\nthe condition of slave and superintendent of the kitchen; taught\r\nnothing but those flimsy accomplishments that would catch the eye\r\nof the prospective husband and master; sneered at, ridiculed, and\r\nabused whenever she attempted to cross the line which hoary prophets\r\nand patriarchal slaveholders had marked across her path; subject to\r\nman’s whim and caprice; her physical development, in time, became\r\nmeagre and crippled. And as her mental faculties were repressed and\r\nimprisoned in the narrowest circle of feminine opinions, it became\r\ndifficult for her to rise above the most commonplace trivialities of\r\nlife. Thus it came about that the term “Weaker Sex,” originally used to\r\nconvey only the acknowledged truth that women are inferior to men in\r\nphysical strength, came to include the mind as well as body. Be this\r\nas it may, the position of women for long centuries was inevitably one\r\nof extreme cruelty and oppression. Countless bitter and unnecessary\r\nlimitations hedged her pathway and obstructed her development from\r\nthe cradle to the grave. It is not to be wondered at that she in time\r\nbecame so inured to her degrading servitude as to accept it as her\r\nnatural position. Madame De Staël has truly said, “Of all the gifts and\r\nfaculties which nature has lavishly bestowed upon woman, she has been\r\nallowed to exercise fully but one, the faculty to suffer.” The extent\r\nof this suffering and the deteriorating influence which it has exerted\r\nupon the race can never be estimated till Finis is written to the story\r\nof humanity.\r\n\r\nIn the noonday of Grecian power and learning, woman trod not beside\r\nman as helpmate and companion, but followed as his slave. Demosthenes\r\ndefines the wife as the “bearer of children, the faithful watch-dog\r\nwho guards the house for her master.” At the Council of Macon, held in\r\nthe sixth century, the question of the soul and humanity of women was\r\ngravely weighed and debated, profound doctors of theology maintaining\r\nthat “woman is not a subject but an object for man’s use and pleasure.”\r\nFor centuries theological divines whetted their wit on helpless woman;\r\nand the church in holy zeal persecuted the woman who was guilty of a\r\nfault as a “daughter of the devil,” and held her up to public contumely\r\nas the concentration of all evil.\r\n\r\nChristianity, indeed, offered emancipation to women. It proclaimed a\r\nstartling doctrine,—the equality of the rich and the poor, the weak\r\nand the strong, in the sight of God the Father. And it became evident\r\nthat such teachings would inevitably break down the barriers of class\r\nand caste, eliminate injustice, and usher in a time when all should\r\nstand equal before the law. But alas, the world, with the exception\r\nof isolated and individual instances, has never been offered an\r\nopportunity to test the efficacy of the all-corrective principles of\r\nthe religion which Christ gave to the world. The repression of women\r\nbiased the reformatory tendencies of Christianity, and rendered it as\r\nineffective as a medium of relief to the oppressed as our one-sided\r\npolitical system of to-day. Christianity, under masculine domination,\r\nwas lost in the rubbish of churchianity, which, professing but failing\r\nto practice the religion of Christ, has held woman in the same contempt\r\nin which she has been held by all the ancient and idolatrous religions\r\nof the world. Yet despite the fact that the great Master, were He to\r\ncome to-day, would scarcely recognize in the churches a trace of the\r\ncode which He lived and died to exemplify, it must not be forgotten\r\nthat the vital principle of religion never dies. It eventually attains\r\nfullest development, and becomes identified with the progress of\r\ncivilization and the highest purpose of a people. Therefore, we may\r\nreverently believe that in the ultimate triumph and rehabilitation of\r\npractical Christianity lies the hope of the oppressed, and true liberty\r\nnot only for women, but for every human being.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Emma Willard]\r\n\r\nEven now the mists are lifting. The great change in the position of\r\nwomen—legal, social, and educational—within a hundred years is\r\nbreaking even the hard shell of orthodox usage. Whole denominations\r\nhave dropped the word “obey” from the marriage service. Many ministers\r\nfrequently omit it, or, if administered, it is pronounced by the bride\r\nwith mental reservation and looked upon as a word that has only the\r\nmost remote and shadowy significance. The new wine is breaking the old\r\nbottles; the spirit of the nineteenth century is too progressive for\r\nthe usages and traditions of the eleventh century. Modern churchianity,\r\nrealizing that women constitute three fourths of its membership,\r\nno longer wages a merciless warfare upon them. It has relaxed its\r\nPauline grip upon her throat, “I suffer not a woman to speak in the\r\nchurches.” And the more advanced theological bodies have offered her\r\nthe intellectual hospitality of the pulpit, where her eloquence is a\r\npleasing change to those who have grown tired of preachers’ platitudes.\r\nClerical decrees are no longer hurled at her defenseless head. The\r\ndoors of churches, schools, and colleges are swinging wide at her\r\napproach, though they sometimes creak on their hinges. The ministers\r\nno longer openly advocate that the gates of opportunity be bolted and\r\nbarred against her. There is everything to stimulate hope; the wings\r\nof feminine nature have expanded till a return to the chrysalis is\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nIt is true that a very large number yet profess to believe that a\r\nwoman fulfills her whole mission in the world when she makes herself\r\nas pretty and agreeable as possible, and devotes all her time and\r\nattention to the discharge of domestic duties. But there has been a\r\nwonderful modification of opinion since Schopenhauer declared that\r\n“woman is not called to great things. She pays her debt to life by the\r\nthroes of birth, care of the children, and subjection to her husband.”\r\nTwo things have tended to bring about this modification of opinion;\r\nthe broader education and increased opportunities for development\r\nattendant upon the growth of individual liberty and republican forms\r\nof government; and the capability of self-maintenance due to improved\r\nmechanical appliances. It is not mere inclination on the part of the\r\nindividual, nor is it the voice of the agitator, that is bringing about\r\nthese changes; it is the irresistible logic of events.\r\n\r\nOne hundred years ago the education of women in the most progressive\r\nand wealthy families went little beyond reading and writing. In 1819,\r\nwhen Mrs. Emma Willard issued an address to the members of the New\r\nYork legislature advocating the endowment of an institution for the\r\nhigher education of women, there was not a college in the country for\r\ngirls. In 1892, the colleges of the United States numbered more than\r\n50,000 female students. In 1888, the ratio of female students to the\r\nwhole number of students pursuing a higher course of education in\r\nuniversities and colleges in this country was 29.3 per centum, or a\r\nlittle more than one fourth. At the same time the ratio in England was\r\n11 per centum; in France, 2 per centum; while in Germany, Austria, and\r\nItaly the ratio was so slight as to be but a mere fraction of 1 per\r\ncentum.\r\n\r\nSuch a thing as a female president of a college was unknown and\r\nprobably undreamed of in the eighteenth century; but we learn from the\r\nReport of the Commissioner of Education for 1887–88 that there are in\r\nthe United States forty-two colleges and institutions for the superior\r\ninstruction of women having a woman for president.\r\n\r\nIn the high and secondary schools, in 1888, over one half of the\r\nstudents were girls. And in the same year, tabulated statistics reveal\r\nthat 63 per centum of the teachers were women. And this percentage will\r\nbecome greater and greater as we grasp the truth that woman is, by\r\ngift of greater intuition and sympathy, the natural instructor of the\r\nhuman race. The salaries paid to women teachers are grossly unfair when\r\ncompared to the pay of male teachers for the same or less work. But as\r\nthe difference in compensation is growing smaller every decade, there\r\nis at least room for hope that this injustice will soon be righted.\r\n\r\nThe law of evolution is the discoverer and formulator of woman’s\r\nadvancement. The invention and use of gunpowder placed the peasant on\r\nan equal war-footing with the mailed knight. The enormous increase\r\nin mechanical appliances and productive machinery has taken woman\r\nout of the rank of unpaid menials, has given her leisure for mental\r\ndevelopment, opportunity to receive recompense for toil, and is largely\r\nbreaking down the physical barriers which had hitherto been considered\r\nunsurmountable. Statistics show that there are forms of machinery\r\nin the operation of which the production of a woman is even greater\r\nthan that of a man, thus furnishing an actual proof of the falsity of\r\nthe idea that woman is incapacitated for competition with man in the\r\nphysical world. And the trend of events is indicated by the statistics\r\ngiven in the Report of the Commissioner of Labor, from which we learn\r\nthat in some trades and professions the percentage of women engaged has\r\nincreased fivefold in the last decade.\r\n\r\nWhile woman’s work has always been a recognized factor in the world’s\r\nprogress, yet her admittance to the field of remunerative work is\r\nlimited to the last one hundred years; is, in fact, the prominent\r\nfeature of the nineteenth century. There is overwhelming evidence\r\nthat her work in every department to which she has been admitted is\r\nas capable, acceptable, and in every way as faithfully performed as\r\nthe work of her brother man. In the last century it is estimated that\r\nnot more than 1 per centum of artists and teachers of art were women;\r\nwhile in 1890 women comprised 48.08 per centum, or nearly one half of\r\nthat profession. Nearly the same proportion of increase is found in the\r\nranks of teachers and musicians,—women now forming over 60 per centum\r\nof the teachers of the United States.\r\n\r\nThere are now about three million women and girls in this country\r\nwho earn their own livelihood. And the eleventh census reveals\r\nthe startling information that in the city of New York there are\r\ntwenty-seven thousand men who are supported by their wives. Yet these\r\nmen, useless to society, a burden to the women who support them, are\r\npermitted the immunities and privileges of law and custom, while women\r\nhave equality only in the duties and punishments.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the eighteenth century there were but few\r\noccupations in which women were permitted to engage. Their abilities\r\nand ambitions were restricted to the school and the home. In the latter\r\nthey received food and shelter as compensation; in the former, but\r\none half or one third the salary allowed to male teachers. The first\r\nnoticeable change in woman’s condition, when she became something\r\nmore than a mere household drudge, whose busy hands carded and wove,\r\nspun and knit, the family supply of cloth, dates from the first bale\r\nof cotton grown in this country in the early years of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. In that bale of cotton lay the seeds of not only a new\r\nmovement in labor, but the beginning of a new epoch for woman, in which\r\nher work and wages were destined to take coherent shape and form. In\r\nall industrial progress since that time women have taken an active part\r\nwhile receiving a meagre share of the product. Forced by the course of\r\nevents to emerge from seclusion and repression, she has passed from\r\none stage of development to another, always a step or two behind man\r\nin the progress of social evolution, till the close of the nineteenth\r\ncentury reveals myriad changes and the actual realization of Tennyson’s\r\nprophetic lines in the “Princess,” “We have prudes for proctors,\r\ndowagers for deans.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEORGE ELIOT.]\r\n\r\nOne hundred years ago it was the duty of a woman to efface herself.\r\nShe was expected to make of herself a mental blank-book upon which her\r\nhusband might inscribe what he would. Thus it is only lately that women\r\nhave begun actively to compete with men in expression of any kind.\r\nIndeed, previous to that time, with a few notable exceptions, they\r\nwere denied recognition of individual life. The woman, if unmarried,\r\nwas merged in the family, or, if married, merged in the husband. Her\r\nname, her religion, her gods, were changed on marriage. But, married\r\nor single, the absorption was complete. So it has happened that woman,\r\nthrobbing with poetic sympathy, has, with the exception of Sappho,\r\nproduced less high and unmistakable poetry than man. With more harmony,\r\nmore music in her nature, her very soul attuned to symphony and rhythm,\r\nshe has been little known as a composer. With far vision and clear\r\nliterary insight, she has been suppressed in art and literature.\r\nGeorge Eliot gave her sublime literary productions to the world under\r\na masculine _nom de plume_, because of the prejudice of even that not\r\nremote day. Fanny Mendelssohn was compelled by her family to publish\r\nher musical compositions as her brother’s. Mary Somerville met only\r\ndiscouragement and ridicule in her mathematical studies. In every\r\nsphere, in every department of science and art, abuse, injustice, and\r\nthe croaking of reactionary frogs have greeted each step of her upward\r\nway. The wonder is, then, not that she has accomplished so little, but\r\nthat she is not in the same condition to-day that she was when Paul\r\nthrust a gag in her mouth in the shape of a Corinthian text, “And if a\r\nwoman would learn anything, let her ask her husband at home.” It will\r\nbe seen, therefore, that the oft-repeated assertion that women have not\r\ngiven to the world as much evidence of genius as men is a Lilliputian\r\nassertion tainted somewhat with envy. “There has been no Shakespeare\r\namong women,” says the advocates of man’s supremacy. With all the world\r\nas their own, and the gates of boundless opportunities swinging wide,\r\nthere has been but one Shakespeare among men. It has been asserted\r\nthat George Eliot is the Shakespeare among women and Mrs. Browning\r\nthe counterpart of Bacon. But their immortality has not been tested.\r\nThey lived but a little while ago. But there is one woman, at least,\r\nwho has established her claim thoroughly, and whose genius twenty-five\r\ncenturies have tested. Sappho is truly immortal. Her fame and genius\r\nhave been sealed by the approval of all the great literati of the\r\ncenturies. Coleridge, who occupies no uncertain place in the world\r\nof letters, says of her, “Of all the poets of the world, of all the\r\nillustrious artists of all literature, Sappho is the one whose every\r\nword has a peculiar and unmistakable poetic perfume, a seal of absolute\r\nperfection and illimitable grace.” Swinburne, the greatest living\r\nmaster in the world of verbal music, declares that, “Her verses are the\r\nsupreme success, the final achievement, of poetic art.” Sappho’s claim\r\nto immortality exceeds that of Shakespeare’s by twenty-three hundred\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nMen, viewing the literary productions of women, are apt to give them\r\nthe color and bias of masculine thought. As instance the poetic critic\r\nof a New York periodical, who wantonly affronts the gifted author of\r\n“Poems of Passion” by declaring that her “fervent verses are but the\r\nburning of unseemly stubble that fails to give forth light or heat.”\r\nYet Ella Wheeler Wilcox, all fair-minded critics will admit, has won\r\na place in the ranks of poetic genius. Her poems throb with human\r\nsympathy, and from the exalted plane of her splendid womanhood she\r\nreaches down, fulfilling the law of Christly service, to lift up the\r\nfallen and soothe and bind the bruised and bleeding. Such masculine\r\ncriticism is dying out, but it has not been uncommon in the past. Mrs.\r\nBrowning and Jane Austen were accused of “breaking down by their\r\nwritings the safeguards of society,” and they were admonished to “cease\r\ntheir literary efforts and devote themselves to sewing and washing\r\ndishes if they would retain the chivalrous respect of men.” “Jane Eyre”\r\nwas pronounced too immoral to be ranked as decent literature. “Adam\r\nBede” was classed as the “vile outpourings of a lewd woman’s mind.” Yet\r\nCharlotte Brontë, George Eliot, Mrs. Browning, and Jane Austen have\r\nwon an exalted and enviable place in the ranks of literature. Their\r\nwritings have thrilled, uplifted, and sweetened humanity.\r\n\r\nThe test of literary genius is to create a character of universal\r\nacceptance. The record of half a century has but one world-wide,\r\nworld-known character of that kind. That character was created by a\r\nwoman. In all literature, no book since the Bible has been so widely\r\ncirculated, so extensively translated, or has so thoroughly commanded\r\nthe profound attention of all classes as Harriet Beecher Stowe’s “Uncle\r\nTom’s Cabin.” Mrs. Stowe impressed her genius upon the race and time,\r\nand marked a new epoch for freedom. Previous to the publication of\r\nher book only a few men recognized slavery as wrong, but a woman’s\r\nsympathetic heart and throbbing genius laid bare the evil and disclosed\r\nto a horrified world the wrong underlying slavery.\r\n\r\nIn philanthropy and the domain of morals there is none who is doing\r\nmore heroic and effective work than Mrs. Elizabeth B. Grannis. She\r\ndeals not with theories, but with real conditions. Her sympathies, her\r\nbroad work, her manifold charities, go out to flesh and blood, men and\r\nwomen. She has the intuitive faculty of probing deep into human nature,\r\nleading those she would reform to mourn real defects, rejoice in real\r\nvictories, and hope and struggle for better things.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRANCES WILLARD.]\r\n\r\nThe constantly broadening sphere of woman’s usefulness is in a large\r\nmeasure due to the organized forms of intellectual activity among women\r\nknown as clubs. Half a century ago club-life for women was unknown.\r\nTheir social sympathies were limited to the political party that\r\nclaimed the franchise of their male relatives, or the church at whose\r\nshrine the women worshiped. But so rapid has been woman’s development\r\nin this direction that to-day women’s clubs form a chain from ocean to\r\nocean, binding them as one great whole. The effect upon the members is\r\nmagical; nature is enlarged; charity broadened; capacity for judgment\r\nincreased; and hitherto unsuspected faculties are called into life and\r\npower.\r\n\r\nThe first organized demand by women for political recognition in the\r\nUnited States was made in 1848, at what was known as the Seneca Falls\r\nConvention. Ridiculed, persecuted, kicked like a football from one\r\ngeneration to another, this brave demand for political recognition was\r\ndestined to become an agency that would work a peaceful revolution.\r\nThat the movement is progressing, and will eventually succeed, is\r\nevinced by the record of half a century. In that time school suffrage\r\nhas been granted in twenty-three States and Territories, partial\r\nsuffrage for public improvements in three States, municipal suffrage\r\nin one, and in four States full political equality. Wyoming was the\r\nfirst State to accord citizenship to her women, and she bears testimony\r\nto its efficacy in the progress, honor, and sobriety of her people.\r\nIn 1893, the Wyoming state legislature passed resolutions highly\r\ncommendatory of woman suffrage and its results, and among other things\r\nsaid, “We point with pride to the fact that after nearly twenty-five\r\nyears of woman suffrage, not one county in Wyoming has a poor-house,\r\nthat our jails are almost empty, and crime, except that by strangers in\r\nthe State, is almost unknown.”\r\n\r\nFrom the banks of the far-off Volga come the good tidings that even\r\nRussia is preparing to take a great step in advance by granting to\r\nwomen many legal and political privileges now enjoyed only by men.\r\nEngland granted municipal suffrage to women a quarter of a century\r\nago, and has more recently granted partial parliamentary suffrage.\r\nAnd to the influence of English law, more particularly the Married\r\nWomen’s Act, is largely due the betterment of the legal status of\r\nwomen throughout the world. In England we find women prominent in art,\r\nliterature, politics, the school and the church. While in this country\r\nthe middle classes have heretofore carried on the suffrage agitation,\r\nin England it finds active workers among the peerage.\r\n\r\nWoman in politics meets with the opposition of job politicians, but\r\nshe realizes that every step of her progress, from the unveiling of\r\nher face to a seat in the legislature of a State, has been taken in\r\nthe face of fierce opposition and in violation of conventionalities\r\nand customs. Undismayed she advances for the ultimate betterment of\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\nThe historian of the future will record the nineteenth century as\r\nthe Renaissance of womankind. And the ultimate effect upon the human\r\nrace of having individuals, not servants, as mothers will surpass the\r\nprogress made in science and in art.\r\n\r\nThe eighteenth century found woman an appendage; the nineteenth\r\ntransformed her into an individual. The wonderful altruistic twentieth\r\ncentury, whose dawn even now is breaking, will so develop this\r\nindividuality that women will contend for all the rights of the\r\nindividual, coöperating with the nation in the fulfillment of its\r\nmission, and with the world in the development of the eternal law of\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\n   “Through the harsh voices of our day\r\n      A low, sweet prelude finds its way;\r\n    Through clouds of doubt and storms of fear\r\n      A light is breaking calm and clear.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CENTURY’S TEXTILE PROGRESS\r\n\r\nBY ROBERT P. HAINS,\r\n\r\n_Examiner of Textiles, U. S. Patent Office_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAntiquity conceals nothing more completely than the origin of the\r\ntextile industry. Back in the dark ages and beyond authentic records,\r\nevidence is furnished that this art was not unknown. Egyptian mummies\r\nshrouded in fine linen fabrics give their silent testimony of ancient\r\nknowledge, but when or where the art had its inception still remains\r\nwrapped in mystery. Nearly every nation of the earth lays claim to its\r\ninvention at some epoch in traditional existence. Thus the Chinese\r\nattribute it to the wife of their first emperor, the Egyptians to Isis,\r\nthe Greeks to Minerva; but probably it had its birth in the Orient,\r\nwhere the making of cloth was known and practiced from the earliest\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nWhatever the merits of rival claimants, certain it is that for many\r\ncenturies the simple distaff and spindle were the only instruments\r\nused for spinning, while the warp and weft were woven together by hand\r\nimplements not less primitive in structure.\r\n\r\nIn the first spinning device, a mass of fibre was arranged on a forked\r\nstick, and, as drawn therefrom by hand, it was twisted between the\r\nfingers and wound on a spindle. During the reign of Henry VIII. of\r\nEngland, however, the spinning-wheel replaced the distaff and spindle,\r\nand in every cottage and palace it became an indispensable article of\r\nhousehold equipment. The young women in all walks of life were taught\r\nto spin. Spinning became the female occupation of the age, and it is\r\ninteresting to note that the modern term spinster, meaning an unmarried\r\nwoman of advanced age, here had its origin.\r\n\r\nThe spinning-wheel, though superior to the distaff and spindle, was\r\nyet a crude machine. It consisted of a stand on which was mounted in\r\nhorizontal bearings a spindle driven by a band from a large wheel\r\npropelled by hand or foot, and as twist was imparted to the fibre drawn\r\nthrough the fingers, the resulting yarn was wound on the spindle.\r\n\r\nThe art of weaving was not more advanced. It is true that the middle of\r\nthe eighteenth century found the hand loom developed from the original\r\nIndian structure to contain many of the essentials of the modern power\r\nloom. It embodied the heddles, the lay, the take-up and let-off beams,\r\nthe shuttle for passing the weft, and in 1740, John Kay added the fly\r\nshuttle motion, whereby the shuttle was thrown through the shed by a\r\nsudden pull on the picking stick; then in 1760, Robert Kay, son of John\r\nKay, invented the drop box, whereby several colors of filling might be\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nBrilliant as these achievements were, the hand loom remained the crude\r\nembodiment of the simple principles of weaving until near the dawn of\r\nthe nineteenth century, when, by the invention of Cartwright, a period\r\nof development was introduced in all lines of textile manufacture\r\nunsurpassed in the annals of industrial progress. The first great\r\nstride, and that which opened the door for further advance, was the\r\ncreation of the spinning-jenny, in England, by Hargreaves, about 1767,\r\nwhereby eight or ten yarns could be spun at one time. Drawing rollers\r\nwere subsequently added by Arkwright, and then traverse motion was\r\ngiven the bobbins in order to automatically build the yarn into a cop.\r\nIt has developed since that the drawing-rollers constituted one of the\r\nmost important fundamental improvements in the spinning art. Their\r\nfunction was to draw out the fibres into a proper size of roving, and\r\nto feed this to be spun. Without them the modern spinning-frame would\r\nnot have been possible. Arkwright’s drawing-rollers and Hargreaves’s\r\nspinning-jenny combined under the invention of Crompton to produce, in\r\nprinciple at least, the modern spinning-mule.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DISTAFF AND SPINDLE.]\r\n\r\nFairly good machines were thus provided on the advent of the nineteenth\r\ncentury for spinning unlimited quantities of yarn, but this, in turn,\r\nrequired proper loom structures to use the same and a corresponding\r\nsupply of raw material. Inventive genius was abroad, and the necessity\r\nmet by Eli Whitney, who, while at the home of General Greene, of\r\nGeorgia, built the first practical machine for separating cotton fibre\r\nfrom its seed.\r\n\r\nWhitney’s gin was constructed on the broad and simple principle that\r\ncotton fibre could be drawn through a smaller space than the attached\r\nseed, and this same principle is the soul and spirit of every saw-gin\r\nof the present day. Prior to Whitney’s gin, cotton fibre was separated\r\nfrom the seed by hand, a day’s work being represented by two or three\r\npounds of cleaned fibre. The daily product of the gin now reaches\r\nbetween three and four thousand pounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPINNING WHEEL.]\r\n\r\nSuch figures demonstrate the important position taken by the cotton\r\ngin among the developing agents of the cotton growing States. It has\r\nrendered possible and profitable the cultivation of large districts\r\nof otherwise waste lands; it has stimulated cotton production; given\r\nemployment to thousands of idle hands; cheapened the price of cotton\r\ncloths, and placed within the reach of the humblest people wearing\r\napparel of fine and beautiful texture.\r\n\r\nUnlimited supply of raw material being thus provided, attention\r\nreverted to perfecting the machines for spinning it, and under the\r\nmagical touch of Richard Roberts, of Manchester, England, in 1830, the\r\ncrude mule of Crompton took practical shape. He gave to it the quadrant\r\nwinding motion, provided for the harmonious working of the counter and\r\ncopping faller wires, perfected the “backing off” and “drawing up”\r\nmechanisms, and gave attention to construction of details that placed\r\nthe mule before the world as a practical success.\r\n\r\nEquipped in its present form, the self-acting mule presents one of the\r\nmost striking examples of complex automatic mechanisms that can be\r\nfound in the industrial world. The work of the attendant is confined to\r\npiecing broken ends and supplying roving, the machine passing through\r\nthe entire cycle of its complicated movements without human direction.\r\nAn idea may be had of its delicate and accurate operation when it is\r\nconsidered that one pound of cotton has been spun by it into a thread\r\none hundred and sixty-seven miles long. Improvements have been made,\r\nindeed, on Roberts’s mule, but aside from changes in details and form,\r\nthe machine, as it left the hands of this mechanical genius in 1830,\r\nremains unchanged.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRIMITIVE HAND LOOM.]\r\n\r\nDuring this period, the fly frame was developed from the machines of\r\nHargreaves and Arkwright, but while it constituted a great advance over\r\nthese machines, it presented no radical departure in principle.\r\n\r\nWe may pause here, as we pass through the third decade of the present\r\ncentury, to witness the introduction of a spinning-frame, which, for\r\noriginality of conception and far reaching influence on the textile\r\nindustry, closely approximates the achievements of the pioneer\r\ninventions of this art. Reference is made to the ring frame in which\r\nthe flyer is omitted, the bobbin being attached to the spindle and\r\nrevolving with it. On the traverse rail, and surrounding each bobbin,\r\nis secured a flanged ring having loosely sprung thereon a light\r\ntraveler, through which the yarn, as it comes from the drawing-rolls,\r\nis led to the bobbin. Revolution of the bobbin carries the traveler\r\naround the ring imparting twist to the yarn, and as it is spun it is\r\nwound on the bobbin in proportion to the feed of the drawing-rolls.\r\n\r\nThe invention of this machine is attributed to John Thorpe, of Rhode\r\nIsland, in 1828, and so popular did it become by reason of decreased\r\npower necessary to drive it, incidental to the omission of the flyers,\r\nand good quality of yarn produced, that, between 1860 and 1865, it\r\nnearly replaced all other machines in America for spinning cotton.\r\n\r\nThe speed of the ring frame, as well as its output, appeared unbounded;\r\nbut at high speeds, under unbalanced loads, the spindles were found to\r\nvibrate in their bearings, and the quality of yarn, in consequence,\r\ndegenerated, the spindle bearings became worn, and the limit seemed\r\nto be reached at five thousand revolutions per minute. A careful\r\nexamination of the ring frame revealed no vulnerable part of its\r\ngeneral structure that could be improved so as to readily secure\r\nincreased speed and steadiness of the spindles when unevenly loaded;\r\nbut with admirable foresight, developing intellects set to improve\r\nthe spindles themselves, and, in 1871, Jacob H. Sawyer introduced and\r\npatented a spindle and bearing, which was one of the most important\r\nimprovements in the ring frame. He chambered the bobbin, and by\r\ncarrying the bolster T well up inside supported the former near its\r\nload centre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EARLY SPINNING JENNY.]\r\n\r\nThe evolution of the spindle was not yet complete. The Sawyer type, at\r\nmore than seven thousand revolutions, would vibrate, and of the many\r\nattempts to cure the defect none succeeded fully until the very simple\r\nchange made by Mr. Rabbeth in 1878. He gave the spindle a small amount\r\nof play by making the bolster loose in its supporting case, and placed\r\na packing between the two.\r\n\r\nA. H. Sherman improved upon the Rabbeth structure by making the bolster\r\nand step in one piece and omitting the packing, the cushioning being\r\ndependent upon the lubricating oil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GINNING COTTON. THE OLD WAY, PRIOR TO 1800.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GINNING COTTON. THE NEW WAY.]\r\n\r\nThe acme of development in this small but most important part of the\r\nring frame was now reached; and in its approved form it embodies the\r\nsleeve whirl extending into the bobbin, the loose, yet adjustable\r\nbolster, tapering spindle, removable step, and lubricating reservoir.\r\nSuch spindles are capable of unlimited speeds,—twenty thousand\r\nrevolutions per minute have been given,—and under absurdly unbalanced\r\nloads they run steadily and with less expenditure of power than the\r\nolder forms at their slower speeds.\r\n\r\nIncreased speed in the spindles, however, brought increased breakage\r\nin the yarn, and although stop motion devices had been employed for\r\nseveral years, yet economy demanded ready means of piecing broken\r\nends. This has been provided recently by mounting the stop clamp upon\r\nthe roving rod well up near the first pair of drawing rolls, so that\r\non pulling the stop wire into place the roving is at once fed between\r\nthe drawing rolls and issues in front, over the spindle, to be easily\r\npieced by one hand. Prior to this, the operative was required to reach\r\nover the machine, feed the roving to the rolls with one hand, hold the\r\nstop wire down with the other, and the broken end of yarn in his teeth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MODERN MULE.]\r\n\r\nExcessive ballooning was also incidental to the use of high speed\r\nspindles, and, while inventive skill has never mastered it, yet the\r\ninjurious effects have been obviated by an ingenious mounting of\r\nseparators, one between each two spindles.\r\n\r\nAside from minor details perfecting the mechanical construction,\r\nsuch has been the evolution of the modern spinning frame. In 1830,\r\nit required the constant attention of one spinner to oversee twenty\r\nslow-running spindles, whereas, in 1896, the same attendant could, with\r\nless effort, “tend” seventy-five or more of the high speed type; and\r\nwhereas, in 1790, when the first American cotton mill was established\r\nby Samuel Slater in Rhode Island, there were only seventy-five spindles\r\non cotton fibre, in 1830, the number had increased to 1,246,703, and in\r\n1890, to 14,188,103.\r\n\r\nUnder such competition no wonder the spinning-wheel of our grandmothers\r\nhas followed the economic law, that the fittest alone survive, and has\r\nbeen relegated to the wood-pile or garret, or, bedecked with ribbons,\r\nfinds a resting-place in the chimney-corner as a decorated curiosity.\r\nIts mighty rival is here. Its attendants have been liberated to more\r\nennobling pursuits. The homespun has been replaced by beautiful\r\nfabrics, and the monster spinning frames of to-day pour forth their\r\nhourly product in miles of spun fibre, where the wheels of our\r\ngrandmothers were taxed to the utmost to produce a very small fraction\r\nof the amount. To appreciate the wonderful change, pause beside the\r\ndomestic wheel used within the memory of the living, and compare its\r\n“whirr,” in slowly producing its single thread, to the “buzz” of the\r\nmodern spinning frame turning out its product from a thousand spindles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAND COMB OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.]\r\n\r\nThe production of yarn required something more than spinning. The\r\nfibres in the massed cotton or wool, as delivered to the manufacturer,\r\nmust be opened, untangled, straightened out, and laid parallel by a\r\nseries of preparing machines prior to being spun, among which the\r\ncarding engine ranks first. In the incipient form, this machine dates\r\nas far back as the middle of the eighteenth century, when, by hand\r\nmanipulation, two cylinders covered with small teeth and working in\r\nclose proximity disintegrated the fibrous mass; but the fibres were\r\nmuch broken and not evenly arranged. The addition of the workers and\r\nstrippers around a rapidly revolving swift gave increased utility to\r\nthe machine, and Bramwell’s feed, in 1871, so regulated the amount of\r\nfibre fed at intervals that the resulting lap possessed the desired\r\neven character. This feed weighs the fibre as it is fed, stops the\r\nlifting apron while the scale pan dumps its load, resets the scale pan,\r\nand automatically starts the lifting apron to again feed the scale,—a\r\ncycle of operations indicating a near approach to human intelligence.\r\n\r\nOne additional machine at least, the comb, requires notice before\r\npassing to the all-important progress made in the loom structure.\r\nWith advancing civilization and refinement came demands for superior\r\nfabrics, which could only be answered by a supply of better fibre.\r\nSuch fibre could only be secured from the bale by separating the long\r\nfrom the short, a problem well calculated to tax the ingenuity of an\r\nenlightened age. Attempts had been made to do this by hand implements\r\nnot unlike the curry-comb of to-day, except that the teeth were long\r\nand tapering. This remained the only means employed for years, while\r\nother textile machinery passed through its phenomenal period of\r\ndevelopment. At last, in 1841, it occurred to Heilman, while watching\r\na lady comb her hair, that a machine might be constructed to comb wool\r\nby drawing a bunch of fibres over pins. He constructed a device on this\r\nprinciple, and in a developed form it is used still and known as the\r\nHeilman or nip comb.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NOBLE COMB OF 1890.]\r\n\r\nIn 1853, James Noble gave to the world the circle comb, wherein two\r\nflat circular rings, having projecting from one face vertical pins,\r\nwere mounted, one eccentrically within the other, and revolved in the\r\nsame direction, the object being to dab the fibre on the rings where\r\nthey met; and then as they revolved and separated the short fibre\r\nwould be drawn off the large ring, leaving the long fibre freed from\r\nthe short. These machines were successful, and above all they were\r\npractical—the operation of the hand comber disappeared from the face\r\nof the earth.\r\n\r\nThe sudden birth and rapid development of mechanically perfect means\r\nfor preparing and spinning fibres were due largely to the comparatively\r\nsimple movements required to draw and twist the yarn, but in the loom\r\nno such problem was presented. Here the movements were complicated\r\nand varied, and the application of power to the manipulation of the\r\ndelicate threads was not susceptible of sudden and successful solution.\r\nThe warps, stretched in a sheet between two beams, had to be opened\r\nto form the shed, the shuttle had to be passed therethrough, the weft\r\nbeaten to place, and means provided to feed the warp and to take up\r\nof the fabric an amount at each beat-up corresponding to the size\r\nof the weft. These were the movements necessary in the most simple\r\nkind of weaving, and though fully understood for many centuries,\r\nas evidenced by the Indian and Egyptian looms, and as embodied in\r\nhand machines of the seventeenth century, it was not till 1787 that\r\nthey were clothed with the application of power. Even then the first\r\nembodiment did not emanate from the hands of a weaver or engineer,\r\nbut from Dr. Cartwright, a clergyman in the church of England. It was\r\nnot surprising that these looms failed of their expectations, for the\r\nshuttle would frequently get trapped in the shed, the driven power-lay\r\nwould break out the warp threads, the take-up and let-off motions were\r\nnot graduated to compensate for the decrease of the warp and increase\r\nof the cloth beams, resulting in thin and thick places in the cloth.\r\nBut this application of power to the loom was the initial step in\r\nthe industrial supremacy of the machine, which to-day works with the\r\nperfect cadence of an automaton.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAIN POWER LOOM, 1840.]\r\n\r\nThe first years of the present century were of unsurpassed activity in\r\nthe inventive field. The spinners were putting forth more yarn than\r\nthe hand-looms could use. It remained for the loom to keep pace with\r\nthe times. Miller, in 1800, Todd and Horrocks in 1803, Johnston in\r\n1807, Cotton in 1810, Taylor in 1815, and many others, concentrated\r\ntheir efforts to develop the plain power-loom; but the second decade of\r\nthe present century saw the old hand-loom with its slow and cumbrous\r\nmovements still mistress of the art.\r\n\r\nThe name of Richard Roberts stands preëminent at this period, between\r\n1820 and 1825, as giving to the power-loom several perfecting touches\r\nin the means for letting off the warp the small amount necessary at\r\neach pick, the means for taking up the finished cloth, the means for\r\nshedding the warp for the passage of the shuttle, and the adaptation\r\nof the stop motions of his predecessors. These changes gave practical\r\nlife to the machine, and overthrew the barrier that obstructed the\r\nadvance of the textile industry. They were, however, only a few of the\r\nimprovements added in perfecting the power-loom, such as the automatic\r\ntemple to hold the cloth extended and prevent drawing of the weft, the\r\nshuttle-guard to prevent accidental jumping of the shuttle from the\r\nrace, the perfect weft-stop to bring the loom to a stand on breakage or\r\nfailure of the weft, the protector mechanism to obviate a “smash” when\r\nthe shuttle failed to box, and the loose reed, all of which stand out\r\nin bold relief as evidences of the progressive tendencies of the age,\r\nand combined in about the year 1838, more than a half century after\r\nCartwright’s first conception of the idea, to complete the practical\r\npower-loom.\r\n\r\nThe loom had not reached a stage of mechanical perfection; much yet\r\nremained to be done, but the plain power-loom of this period was both\r\na practical and financial success. By its immediate predecessor, the\r\nhand-loom, a good weaver and assistant could work from forty to fifty\r\npicks per minute, and weave plain cloth. By the power-loom of 1840,\r\none weaver could “tend” two looms running from 100 to 120 picks per\r\nminute and produce the same cloth. Without passing through the various\r\nsteps which culminated in the power-loom for plain cloth, now in use,\r\nand tracing the causes that led to perfection of details, the amazing\r\nadvance from the ancient and 18th-century hand loom to the power-loom\r\nof 1840 and that of to-day may well be shown by comparing the machines\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nSuch was the simple form of the power-loom. One half of the warps\r\nwere alternately raised and lowered for the shot of weft; but as a\r\nwoven fabric is one in which the warp and weft are united by passing\r\nthem over and under each other, the figure or pattern of the cloth\r\nwill be varied as the threads are crossed in different combinations,\r\nand this will depend on the order of raising and lowering the warp\r\nthreads, and the introduction of different characters and colors of\r\nweft. This brings up for review the most important parts of the loom\r\nstructure—the shedding mechanism and shuttle-box motions—through\r\nwhose agencies the most beautiful and complicated designs are produced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WEAVING. THE OLD WAY.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WEAVING. THE NEW WAY.]\r\n\r\nShedding mechanism was present of course in all looms, but in the\r\npower-looms of the early part of this century it was confined to\r\ntappets adjusted on a revolving shaft, and the number of heddles was\r\nlimited to six or eight. Fairly good twills and other like fabrics\r\ncould be produced within the limits of the few heddles, but with the\r\nintroduction of the “dobbie,” or that part of the loom which raises and\r\nlowers the harness-frames, a new era in fancy weaving was inaugurated.\r\nBy this ingenious device as many as thirty-six or even forty heddles\r\ncould be used and raised at will to form figures. The creation of the\r\ndobbie belongs to the 19th century, and it is found in practical form\r\nabout 1863 in the United States under the name of the American or\r\nKnowles dobbie. The essentials are the two cylinder gears revolving\r\nconstantly, the vibrating gears, carried on the end of pivoted arms and\r\nhaving teeth on a part of their periphery, the harness jacks connected\r\nto the heddle frames, and the links joining the vibrating gears and\r\nharness jacks in such manner that part revolution of the former causes\r\nthe latter to move the connected heddle frame, and consequently the\r\nwarp threads, up or down. A pattern chain determines what vibrator\r\ngears shall engage the cylinder gears, and, once the chain is fitted\r\nto the design to be woven, nothing remains for the loom tender but to\r\noversee the operation of the machine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOOM OF 1890.]\r\n\r\nAnother form of dobbie, not less popular than the Knowles, developed\r\ninto a perfect automatic device about fifty years ago in England. Here\r\ntwo reciprocating knives are engaged, under the direction of a pattern\r\nchain, by one of two hooked jacks connected to the harness levers, and\r\nthe shed is again formed without human intervention. Other forms of\r\ndobbie structures have been evolved during the last fifty years, but\r\nthese two, with some modifications and additions of details, have come\r\nextensively into practical use, and represent the zenith of development\r\nat the present time. By their aid great variety is rendered possible in\r\nthe design on the resulting fabric. The figured tablecloths, damasks,\r\ntwills, satins, bordered and cross-bordered fabrics, are now possible\r\nat a cost of a thousandth part only of that incurred when produced by\r\nany of the old types of machines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JACQUARD MACHINE.]\r\n\r\nThe subject of shedding, i. e., of opening the warp-threads to afford\r\na passage for the shuttle, is so inseparably connected with the name\r\nof Jacquard, that attention is now carried to that wonderful invention\r\nevolved in the first few years of the present century, and by the use\r\nof which it may truly be said that anything can be woven as figure\r\nin a fabric that can be designed by the hand of man. It is as well\r\nadapted for the finest silks as for heavy carpets and figured velvets,\r\nand by an operation theoretically so simple as to excite wonder that\r\nit remained hidden until this age. Jacquard was a native of France\r\nand exhibited his machine complete in 1804, but so bitter was the\r\nopposition that the first machine was destroyed and burned. Its\r\nmerits were clear, however, and reconstruction and general adoption\r\nin France followed soon after. It has since been applied not only for\r\nshedding but for every purpose where mechanical operations could be\r\ncontrolled by a pattern. In brief, this machine simply controls each\r\nwarp thread separately by a cord having a hook attached. These hooks\r\nare arranged near the path of a reciprocating griffe or frame carrying\r\ncross bars, and are controlled, as to engagement with the bars, by a\r\ncard perforated according to a pattern; thus any one or any number of\r\nthreads can be raised at will. The dobbie controls harness frames each\r\ncarrying a large number of warp threads; the Jacquard controls every\r\nthread separately. The greatly increased capacity of the latter machine\r\nis apparent. Thus a 1500-hook Jacquard will do the work of thirty\r\ndobbies of fifty jacks each.\r\n\r\nThe hand-shuttle box mechanism of Kay’s time has developed into the\r\nmachine operated as a sliding or revolving shuttle-box controlled by\r\npattern devices, which, being added to a dobbie or Jacquard equipped\r\nloom within the last twenty-five years, presents the highest point\r\nof perfection attained in the textile art. In such looms the warp\r\nthreads, arranged in any colors, may be raised at will collectively or\r\nindividually, any one of ten or twelve different colored wefts may be\r\nintroduced as desired, and combinations may thus be formed to produce\r\ndesigns of the most complicated nature.\r\n\r\nPile fabrics, cut, uncut, and tufted, represent a type quite distinct\r\nfrom those produced on the ordinary fancy loom just described, and, in\r\nthe form of velvets, imitation animal skins, and Brussels carpet, were\r\nalmost unknown prior to the invention of Samuel Bigelow of Boston, in\r\n1837. Fabrics of this character, if made at all, were the products of\r\ntedious hand methods, and on account of the consequent high price were\r\nthe exclusive property of the very wealthy. Carpets with pile surface\r\nhad been made by the Persians and Turks ages ago, by tying pieces\r\nof woolen yarn around longitudinal or warp threads, and binding the\r\nwhole together by a weft at intervals; and such tufts, being carefully\r\nselected as to color, were made to present rich designs, but, like all\r\nother hand-produced fabrics, these were the property of the few.\r\n\r\nThe pile fabric loom of Bigelow opened the way for an advance\r\nin the carpet industry which continues to the present time; its\r\nultimate effect being to place carpets within the reach of the\r\nhumble cottager; and floors which were strewn with brush, or at best\r\nconcealed by the home-made rag carpet, now became covered by a soft\r\nand beautifully figured fabric. This loom was a practical machine,\r\nand at once commended itself to the manufacturer. It consisted of the\r\nold power-loom provided with a Jacquard, already well understood, to\r\nwhich was added an attachment to introduce wires at intervals as false\r\nweft, and bind the warp around them by the usual weft threads. The\r\nwires being withdrawn after a few shots had been woven, left the warp\r\nloops standing, and these loops being formed under the dictates of the\r\nJacquard, any character of beautiful design could be produced. Velvets,\r\nbrocades, even the fine imitation of sealskin, are the simple products\r\nof this form of power-loom when the pile loops are cut. Greater\r\ncheapness in weaving cut pile fabrics has been secured by a slight\r\nmodification in the Bigelow loom, so that two fabrics could be woven\r\nat one time. This idea was introduced about 1850, and it contemplated\r\nweaving the two fabrics face to face, keeping them separated by the\r\nusual pile wires of Bigelow, and passing the pile threads from one\r\nfabric to the other. Upon cutting the two cloths apart through the\r\nthreads uniting them, two cut pile or velvet fabrics resulted. This\r\nloom required the service of two shuttles and double the number of\r\nwarp-beams, but it worked well, and is to-day largely in use and well\r\nadapted to its purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SMITH AND SKINNER LOOM FOR MOQUETTE CARPETS.]\r\n\r\nThe demand for tufted pile fabrics, meaning those in which the pile is\r\nformed from tufts or yarns, individually tied to the foundation fabric,\r\nand of which the rich Turkish and Persian rugs are examples, had not\r\nbeen met by the Bigelow loom; in fact it was only about forty years\r\nago that the mechanical production of such fabrics became possible.\r\nSmith and Skinner were the pioneers to enter this field, and the\r\nfirst, by the aid of machinery, to compete with the cheap hand-labor\r\nof the orientals. The invention of a machine that will select any\r\ndesired color from a large number of yarns, carry it between the\r\nwarp-threads at the exact spot necessary to form the figure, tie it\r\naround these threads, cut it off to the length necessary to form an\r\neven and smooth surface, return the unused portion to place, and do\r\nall quickly, accurately, and with little cost, is an achievement that\r\nmay rightly claim the admiration of the industrial world. Yet this\r\nis what the machine inaugurated by Smith and Skinner does to-day. The\r\ngeneral movements and complicated parts of the power-loom are present\r\nas for weaving a plain fabric, and on beams or large spools carried by\r\na chain, under the control of a pattern, are arranged the tuft yarns,\r\nin the order in which they should appear in the figure. Through the\r\npattern devices the proper spool or beam is brought into position to be\r\nseized by a pair of fingers which rise, take the spool from the chain,\r\nlower it to the warp, pass the ends of the tuft yarn through and around\r\nthe proper warp thread, hold them till the insertion of a binding weft,\r\nthen, when they have been properly cut to length, return the spool into\r\nits place in the chain. This creation of mechanical genius takes rank\r\nwith the wonders of the spinning mule and, like that machine, passes\r\nthrough its entire operation with the _precision of an automaton_. By\r\nits aid close imitations of the oriental hand-made rugs are placed\r\nbefore the world at one quarter the former price, and, as a result, the\r\nfine moquette and axminster carpets lend their beauty to nearly every\r\nhome in the land.\r\n\r\nThe credit for improving the power-loom so as to adapt it for weaving\r\nfancy cassimeres and suitings, belongs to William Crompton, a native of\r\nEngland, who came to the United States in 1836, and shortly thereafter,\r\nin the Middlesex Mills at Lowell, Mass., constructed and operated\r\nthe first fancy cassimere power-loom, not only in this country, but\r\nin the world. Prior to this the harness for all woolen and worsted\r\npower-looms was worked by cams, and the cloth was woven plain; but\r\nCrompton’s loom of 1840 started a new era in the woolen industry,\r\nrendering it possible to produce any fancy weave by an arrangement of\r\npattern chain and large number of harnesses in connection with the\r\nchange shuttle-boxes. Improvements followed, by the substitution of the\r\nreverse shuttle-box motion in 1854, the perfection of the general loom\r\nstructure in 1857, the addition of the upright lever harness motion in\r\n1864, and the centre-stop in 1879, so that at the present time this\r\nmachine is adapted to run at high speeds and weave at moderate cost the\r\nmost complicated designs in woolen and worsted—such as shawls, checks,\r\nsuitings, and all forms of fancy cassimeres.\r\n\r\nThe general industrial activity in all matters pertaining to textile\r\nmanufacture between the years 1835 and 1860, brought forth many forms\r\nof looms of special adaptation to meet the increasing demands of\r\nsociety. The narrow-ware loom appeared in the third decade of this\r\ncentury, and the addition of the dobbie, or Jacquard, later, equipped\r\nthis loom for the simultaneous production of several ribbons, or\r\nnarrow fabrics, side by side, having plain or figured effect. The lay\r\nwas divided into several reed spaces, and a corresponding number of\r\nshuttles, operated by rack and pinion, carried the weft-threads through\r\nthe adjacent warp.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of this century, and until the adoption of the more\r\nrich and delicate fabrics, hair-cloth was the accepted covering for\r\nfurniture, and power-looms for its production quickly answered the\r\ndemand. They reached such a degree of perfection and efficiency in this\r\ncountry that almost the entire industry was centred here. This fabric\r\nwas made from the hair of horses’ tails as weft, and a strong cotton\r\nwarp; and as the weft could not be wound upon bobbins, as usual, each\r\nseparate hair was inserted by an ingenious device made to reciprocate\r\nthrough the shed, and select one out of a bundle of hairs cut to the\r\nsame length. The conception of a power device capable of the delicate\r\noperation necessary to weave hair-cloth, could never have been realized\r\nexcept in a highly intelligent manufacturing community; but in 1870,\r\nRhode Island alone produced on such machines over 600,000 yards,\r\nconsuming thereby the hair of about eight hundred thousand horse-tails.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CIRCULAR LOOM.]\r\n\r\nThe evolution of the lappet loom started between 1840 and 1850 in\r\nEngland and Germany. It sought to enhance the pleasing effect of plain\r\nfabrics, by placing an embroidered or raised figure over the surface\r\nduring the weaving process. Near the lower edge of ladies’ skirts,\r\non the ends of neckties and like articles, an embroidered effect was\r\ndesirable; and this has been secured by the lappet attachment to\r\nthe present power-loom. In this a needle is mounted in appropriate\r\nlocation, usually back of the lay, and through an eye in the end\r\nthereof the lappet thread is led from a suitable supply. This needle\r\nis normally either above or below the warp. When a spot or figure is\r\nwanted, it is caused to move into the plane of the opposite warps\r\nof the shed, under the direction of suitable controlling pattern\r\nmechanisms. The shuttle being then shot, the lappet thread appears\r\nupon the surface, and it may be made to thus appear as often as\r\ndesired; its position being shifted as necessary under the guidance of\r\na pattern-chain to form, in embroidery effect, any character of small\r\ndesign.\r\n\r\nClosely allied to the lappet loom in the effect produced is the\r\nswivel-shuttle loom, which has come extensively into use during the\r\nlast thirty years to supply demands for spotted or embroidered figures.\r\nThe loom is of the plain type, having small swivel-shuttles movable\r\nin carrier blocks, which are secured to the supporting bar near the\r\ntop of the lay-reed, in convenient location to permit the shuttles\r\nto be depressed into the shed. Each swivel-shuttle is provided with\r\na rack engaging a suitable operating pinion to move the shuttles\r\nsimultaneously from one carrier to the next. Normally these shuttles\r\nare held above the warp plane, and the loom in this condition weaves\r\ntabby or twill. At the desired moment, the supporting-bar is lowered by\r\na cam or Jacquard to bring the shuttles in the shed; the shuttles are\r\nmoved from one carrier to the next adjacent, and then all are raised to\r\ntheir normal position above the warp. The ground weft is laid and the\r\nbeat-up takes place. Repetition develops a spot or figure at intervals\r\nacross the entire fabric, and with the use of different colored\r\nswivel-threads the greatest diversity of embroidered effect is secured\r\nover the entire ground. Some of the most beautiful spotted silks for\r\nladies’ dresses and fancy scarfs, never before contemplated, are now\r\nwoven on this loom at prices that are very moderate for such a class of\r\ngoods.\r\n\r\nA radical departure from the paths traveled by prior inventors was\r\ninaugurated about 1859, in adapting the power-loom for weaving tubular\r\nfabrics, resulting twenty years later in perfecting a machine in which\r\nthe warp threads were arranged in circular series and the weft laid in\r\nthe circular shed by a continuously moving shuttle. Fire-hose and like\r\ntubular cloths resulted. Rapid development continued from the middle\r\nof the present century, so that nearly every conceivable form of loom,\r\nfrom the light running plain fabric and gingham looms to the heavy\r\nstructures for weaving canvas and wire cloth, claimed the attention\r\nof the inventor; and in this last decade of the century looms are\r\nconstructed to weave anything that can be woven. Wire, slats, cane,\r\nstraw, and glass, as well as the light fibres of cotton, wool, or silk,\r\nare now easily manipulated on the power-loom and woven into cloths,\r\nmattings, baskets, cane-seats for furniture, bottle-covers, and ever so\r\nmany irregular forms that, in the dormant condition of this industry\r\nprior to the nineteenth century, were quite beyond consideration of the\r\nmost active enthusiast of the art.\r\n\r\nWonderful as these achievements have been, the restless ambition of\r\ninventive genius remains unsatisfied. Improvements continue—especially\r\nin the United States, under the fostering care of a liberal patent\r\nsystem—and attempts are now being made, and with success, to form\r\nthe power-loom into a thoroughly automatic machine incapable of\r\nproducing any but the best quality of cloth. Upon the breakage or\r\nundue slackening of a warp thread, the loom would continue to weave\r\nand produce imperfect fabric until the attendant had pieced the broken\r\nend or adjusted the slack thread. Means were devised some years ago\r\nto remedy this defect, but with only partial success until near the\r\nclose of this century. Breakage or failure more often occurred in the\r\nweft, however, and though the weft stop-motion successfully detected\r\nthe fault and stopped the loom, yet much valuable time was lost, and\r\nconstant attention was needed to supply new filling. Progressive\r\ntendencies of the closing years of this decade have sought to meet this\r\ndifficulty. As a result, means are now provided whereby, on failure or\r\nbreakage of the weft, the loom discharges its imperfect filling from\r\nthe shuttle, supplies itself with a new weft from the hopper, places\r\nit in the shuttle, and continues to weave. Such a loom provided with a\r\nwarp stop-motion is almost incapable of producing imperfect cloth, and\r\nso long as the warps remain intact and the hopper is kept supplied with\r\nweft-bobbins, it will continue to weave. In fact, in many mills of the\r\nNew England States these looms are now left to run during the dinner\r\nhour without an attendant, and no imperfect cloth is produced.\r\n\r\nSuch machines are almost independent of human attention, yet they are\r\nthe evolution of the old-time hand loom. Just one hundred years ago\r\nthe hand loom, running at 40 or 50 picks to the minute, required the\r\nwatchful care of an expert weaver; in 1840, the same weaver could\r\n“tend” from two to four power-looms running 100 to 120 picks; to-day he\r\noversees from 10 to 16 looms running from 150 to 200 picks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FIRST KNITTING MACHINE. LEE.]\r\n\r\nThe homespun, with its old familiar butternut dye, has disappeared. The\r\nspinning-wheel and loom no longer occupy a part of every home. In their\r\nstead, the farmer, as he looks beyond the thriving cornfields, beholds\r\nthe reeking chimneys of a thousand mills as they proclaim the majesty\r\nof the power machines. The fabrics produced are beautiful and varied in\r\ndesign, and their cost so low as to excite wonder that such progress\r\ncould have been the result of one hundred years of industrial activity.\r\n\r\nThe emancipation of knitting, as a domestic occupation, dates from the\r\nromantic experiences of William Lee, a subject of Queen Elizabeth,\r\nof whom it is related that while watching the deft fingers of his\r\nlady-love guide the knitting needle from loop to loop, conceived the\r\nidea of performing the operation by mechanical means. It is a singular\r\ncoincidence also that the invention of this the first machine for\r\nknitting purposes, like that of the power-loom for weaving, should have\r\nemanated from the hands of a student and clergyman, unfamiliar with the\r\nart.\r\n\r\nLee’s device was naturally crude. It contained only twelve needles,\r\narranged in a row with about seven or eight to the inch, but it\r\nsuccessfully formed a knitted web. Further progress in the art was\r\nslow, on account of the strong opposition to all machines which seemed\r\nlikely to deprive the hand artisan of occupation. The Queen refused\r\nto grant a patent to Lee for this reason, and knitting remained the\r\nexclusive prerogative of women for many years. Like the spinning-wheel,\r\nhowever, the hand knitting-needle beheld a rival, which in the\r\ndiversity of human wants was destined to create one of the great\r\nindustrial pursuits of the age.\r\n\r\nStockings, like all other garments, were first made by sewing together\r\npieces of linen, silk, cotton, or woolen cloth, resulting in a poorly\r\nfitting article, prolific of uncomfortable seams. Knitting the entire\r\nhose in a single piece by hand needles overcame these defects to an\r\nextent, and the Lee machine opened the way for the production of such\r\narticles on a scale that now furnishes the civilized world.\r\n\r\nLee’s machine produced a straight web which required to be cut and sewn\r\nto shape; then to it was added the ribbing device and the narrowing and\r\nwidening attachment, to shape the web to fit the body without cutting;\r\nbut still a seam existed in the stocking where the edges united. In\r\n1816, however, M. I. Brunel built a circular machine having an endless\r\nrow of needles, and in 1831, Timothy Bailey, of New York, applied power\r\nto the knitting frame; the result being that at this time a tubular\r\nseamless fabric could be produced on a power machine.\r\n\r\nThe latch-needle, which has given to the knitting machine great\r\ncapacity and diversity of product, was not invented until about 1847,\r\nby Mr. Aiken, of New Hampshire. A period of development then set in\r\nthat continues to the present time. The needles by cam mechanism\r\nwere made independently operative in a circular carrier; narrowing\r\nand widening devices to produce pouches, such as the heels and toes\r\nof stockings, were added, as was also feeding mechanism for the\r\nintroduction of different colored yarn, or a reinforcing thread. Such\r\nmachines, of 1868 and 1870, would form a stocking or undergarment\r\nwell fitted to the form; but they required the constant attention of\r\na skilled knitter, until pattern mechanism was introduced to control\r\nthe time of introduction of the colored or additional thread, and the\r\nplace for formation of the narrowed or widened web. In forming the heel\r\nand toe pockets, a part of the needles are thrown out of action, and\r\nthe movements to operate the active needles are changed from round and\r\nround, or circular work, to reciprocating. At each reciprocation one or\r\nmore needles, at the end of the series, are rendered inactive, until\r\none half the required pocket is formed; then they are successively\r\nreturned to action, and circular knitting resumed. It may be also an\r\nadditional thread is introduced to reinforce the wearing qualities of\r\nthe heel and toe, or a differently colored yarn may be thrown in to\r\ngive figure, but all such movements are now automatically controlled\r\nby a pattern mechanism. The ribbed leg portion of a stocking is formed\r\neither in the same machine that fashions the foot or in a separate\r\nmachine to which the foot is transferred, but in either case the\r\npattern mechanism again controls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KNITTING IN THE OLD WAY.]\r\n\r\nWithin the last twenty years this art has been so greatly improved,\r\nespecially in the hosiery line, that the automatic machine of to-day\r\npasses through the entire operation of knitting the article, finishing\r\nit off, and starting afresh without other aid than a supply of yarn.\r\nMoreover, the machine now to be considered practical must be so\r\nconstructed that it will continue thus to operate without repairs or\r\nloss of time from month to month; and its daily output will average\r\nmore than the old hand machines could accomplish in a week. By hand\r\nknitting one hundred loops could be formed per minute; by Lee’s machine\r\nas many as fifteen hundred were possible in the same time; but to-day,\r\nthe automatic machine will average between 300,000 and 400,000 loops,\r\nand at the same time will produce a finer web, shaped to fit the form\r\nof the wearer.\r\n\r\nSuch comparisons reveal the vitally important progress made in the\r\nknitting industry, through which most of our underwear, stockings,\r\nscarfs, neck-comforts, and woolen gloves are supplied. The labor and\r\ntime saving devices developed in this class of machines, and the fact\r\nthat unskilled workmen may “tend” from fifteen to twenty of them,\r\nlargely accounts for the universal adoption of warm and comfortable\r\nwearing apparel by all classes of society.\r\n\r\nThe number of patents granted on textile machinery during the\r\nnineteenth century furnishes an index to the progress made. Prior to\r\n1800, less than one hundred patents were granted in the United States,\r\nwhile since that time, and up until July, 1895, about 15,200 patents\r\nwere issued, covering tangible and material improvements over the old\r\nstructures. The beneficent effects of these inventions are attested\r\nby the wonderful and continuous reduction in cost to the consumer of\r\nall kinds of textile fabrics. For the manufacturer, these have made\r\npossible increased production in a given time with less manual labor.\r\nWhen it is remembered that the labor cost is about one half the total\r\ncost of production of textile fabrics, it will be apparent that the\r\nbeneficial effects of any labor-saving device are felt as well by the\r\nconsumer as the producer.\r\n\r\nIn 1870 the number of textile establishments in the United States was\r\n3035, giving occupation to 146,897 employees, and consuming annually\r\n359,420,829 pounds of textile fibres, while in 1890 the number of\r\nestablishments had increased to 4114, employing 511,897 hands, and\r\nconsuming the enormous amount of 1,572,548,933 pounds of fibres;\r\nrepresenting progress and growth in the textile arts not excelled by\r\nany other manufacturing industry.\r\n\r\nFood and clothing constitute the primary wants of man. The former\r\ngrew ready for his use as a natural product of the soil. The latter\r\nhe had to produce by artificial means to afford that protection which\r\nnature failed to provide. Next to agriculture, therefore, man’s early\r\nattention was directed to securing a covering for the body. Looking\r\nback through the vista of years dimmed by the mists of very remoteness,\r\nwe find the animal and vegetable kingdoms destined to contribute to his\r\nneeds. There were the blue flax-fields; cotton-bolls, scattered like\r\npowdered snow about the land, coquetting in wanton abandon with winds\r\ntempered by an all-wise Power to the shepherd-watched sheep; goats\r\nroaming the vale of Cashmere; silk-worms of Ceres, and the grasses of\r\nspring, overflowing with allurements of assistance for his adornment.\r\nWith these essentials has man wrought a mighty miracle. The genius\r\nof Industrial Art, awakened by the fascinating influence of Nature,\r\ninvoked the Goddess of Invention, approaching her temple not with loud\r\nacclaim, as marked the herculean strides in other arts and sciences,\r\nbut modestly, though tenaciously and most effectually. For not more is\r\nwoman emancipated by the sewing machine than both sexes by the doing\r\naway of the spinning-wheel, the household knitter, and hand-worked\r\nloom. Not more do electricity and steam power facilitate the various\r\noccupations of man than do the many textured fabrics add to his needs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KNITTING IN THE NEW WAY.]\r\n\r\nIn all the phases of social life is this industry manifest. If the\r\nbanquet hall is warmed and lighted by electricity, so, also, is it\r\nadorned with tapestries, silken and artistic, napery surpassingly\r\nsmooth, and laces intricately wrought.\r\n\r\nHow like a fairy tale reads the evolution of textile progress!\r\nConceptions, infinite in range and variety, alike pleasing to the eye\r\nand gratifying to vanity, have been spun, woven, knit, and embroidered,\r\nuntil, standing as we do at the dawn of another century, upon the\r\nsummit of unparalleled achievements, we ask, “Can the mind conceive,\r\nthe heart desire, or the hand execute more.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CENTURY’S RELIGIOUS PROGRESS\r\n\r\nBY GEORGE EDWARD REED, S.T.D., LL.D.,\r\n\r\n_President Dickinson College, Carlisle, Pa._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe closing years of the nineteenth century, both in Europe and the\r\nUnited States, are characterized by a religious life as phenomenal with\r\nrespect to development and influence as those of the eighteenth were\r\nphenomenal for lethargy and decline. “Never,” says a writer in the\r\nNorth British Review, “has a century risen on England so void of soul\r\nand faith as that which opened with Anne (1702), and reached its misty\r\nnoon beneath the second George (1732–1760),—a dewless night succeeded\r\nby a sunless dawn. The Puritans were buried and the Methodists were not\r\nborn.” In this opinion, all historians and essayists concur.\r\n\r\nAmong the clergy were many whose lives were of the Dominie Sampson\r\norder, described in Scott’s “Guy Mannering”—men whose lives were the\r\nscandal and reproach of the church; who openly taught that reason is\r\nthe all-sufficient guide; that the Scriptures are to be received only\r\nas they agree with the light of nature; pleading for liberty while\r\nrunning into the wildest licentiousness. Montesquieu, indeed, did not\r\nhesitate to charge Englishmen generally with being devoid of every\r\ngenuine religious sentiment. “If,” he says, “the subject of religion is\r\nmentioned in society, it excites nothing but laughter. Not more than\r\nfour or five members of the House of Commons are regular attendants at\r\nchurch.”\r\n\r\nFrom the colleges and universities, the great doctrines of the\r\nReformation were well-nigh banished, a refined system of ethics,\r\nhaving no connection with Christian motives, being substituted for the\r\nprinciples of a divinely revealed law.\r\n\r\nOn every side faith seemed to be dying out; indeed, would have died out\r\nbut for the tremendous reformation in life and morals induced by the\r\nself-denying and heroic labors of the Wesleys and their coadjutors,\r\nto whom, more than to any beside, England owes her salvation from a\r\nrelapse into barbarism,—a service which in later years won for the\r\nWesleys a memorial in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\nOn the Continent, religious conditions were no better. In France the\r\nmasses were yet reeling amid the excesses of the Revolution. Voltaire\r\nand Rousseau were the oracles and prophets of their times,—the popular\r\nidols of the hour. Voltaire, indeed, openly boasted that he alone\r\nwould laugh Christianity out of the court of public opinion, declaring\r\nthe whole system to be outgrown and powerless. Germany, given over to\r\ntheological speculation, crushed beneath the weight of the Napoleonic\r\nwars, and torn by internal dissensions, gave but little hope that upon\r\nher altars the dying fire of the great Reformation would ever again\r\nflame forth as in the older and more heroic days.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, similar conditions prevailed, especially\r\nduring the last decade of the eighteenth century and the first of\r\nthe nineteenth. Forms of infidelity the most radical and revolting\r\nprevailed throughout the land. Many of the leading statesmen, in\r\nprivate at least, did not scruple to confess themselves atheists or\r\ndeists. Thomas Paine was the popular idol; his “Age of Reason” almost\r\nas common as the Bible itself. The majority of the men taking part with\r\nhim in the founding of the government, with but few exceptions, held\r\ntheological sentiments akin to his, although declining to participate\r\nin his violent and brutal assaults upon the Scriptures and the\r\ninstitutions of Christian society.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BIRMINGHAM MEETING-HOUSE (ANCIENT).]\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the earlier days of the century, Chancellor Kent, in one\r\nof his published works, declared that in his younger days the men of\r\nhis acquaintance in professional life who did not avow infidelity were\r\ncomparatively few. Bishop Meade, of Virginia, in his autobiography,\r\nstates that “scarcely a young man of culture could be found who\r\nbelieved in Christianity.”\r\n\r\nThe colleges and universities were so filled with youthful skeptics\r\nthat when, in 1795, Timothy Dwight assumed the presidency of Yale,\r\nhe found but four or five willing to admit that they were members\r\nof churches. So far did they go in their devotion to the French\r\ninfidelity prevalent at the time, that the seniors of the college were\r\ncommonly known among themselves by the names of Diderot, D’Alembert,\r\nRobespierre, Rousseau, Danton, and the like. Harvard, Princeton,\r\nWilliam and Mary, the University of Virginia,—all the colleges\r\nindeed,—were as thoroughly hotbeds of skepticism as nurseries of\r\nlearning.\r\n\r\nThe period, too, was one of internecine strife among the feeble\r\nchurches themselves. Divisions on doctrinal lines were incessant;\r\ndepartures from the faith as numerous as they were disastrous. Of\r\nthe missionary spirit so gloriously characteristic of the nineteenth\r\ncentury there was not even a trace. Up to 1793, not a missionary\r\nsociety was in existence on either side of the ocean. The same was\r\ntrue of hospitals, asylums, of every form of organized effort for the\r\nreclamation of the masses or the amelioration of human ill.\r\n\r\nIn Boston, as late as 1811, men of literary or political distinction,\r\neager to listen to the marvelous revival preaching of the celebrated\r\nDr. Griffin, attended his services surreptitiously, or in disguise,\r\nfearful lest knowledge of attendance upon religious services of such\r\nvulgar character should detract from the dignity of their social\r\nstanding.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the times were bad, the outlook for Christianity dark,\r\nthe period, nevertheless, was not wholly without gleams of light.\r\nThe spiritual leaven imparted by Whitefield in his mighty preaching\r\ntours, by Edwards, Dwight, Asbury, Griffin, and others of equally\r\nheroic stamp, gradually began to work,—slowly at first, but with ever\r\naccelerating movement,—until at last the triumphant successes of\r\nthe present century began their stately march. By degrees a new life\r\nappeared among the churches, heralding the dawn of a new and brighter\r\nday. Revivals of religion, many of them powerful and sweeping, broke\r\nout in many parts of the country. Massachusetts, Virginia, Kentucky,\r\nTennessee, the Carolinas, Georgia, were in succession the theatres of\r\nmovements which, before they had spent their force, had completely\r\nrevolutionized the conditions of unfaith, immorality, and spiritual\r\napathy so long prevailing. These upheavals of spiritual power,\r\ncontinuing during the first twenty-five years of the century, laid\r\nbroad and deep the foundations of the mighty achievements of the church\r\nwhich we are now to consider. How extensive, how wonderful, have been\r\nthese achievements can perhaps best be understood by a consideration of\r\nthe changed conditions marking the close of the century.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, that the people of the United States are a\r\nreligious people may be inferred from the amazing number and variety\r\nof religions abounding and flourishing within our borders. It may be\r\ndoubted that in any other Christian country of the earth there can be\r\nfound so many varieties of religion, so many church organizations, so\r\nmany and diverse peculiarities of doctrine, polity, and usage, as here.\r\nIt is a land of churches; churches for whites, churches for blacks;\r\nchurches large and churches small; churches orthodox and churches\r\nheterodox; churches Christian and churches pagan; churches Catholic\r\nand churches Protestant; churches liberal and churches conservative,\r\nCalvinistic and Armenian, Unitarian and Trinitarian; representing\r\nnearly every phase of ecclesiastical and theological thought. As\r\nAmericans have distanced the world in the extent and variety of their\r\nmaterial inventions, so have they distanced the world in the extent\r\nand variety of their theological and ecclesiastical forms. The state\r\ncannot control the church, and the church is as free as the state. As\r\na man may freely transfer his citizenship from one State to another,\r\nto each in turn, so may he, if he shall so desire, pass from one\r\necclesiastical communion to another, until he shall have exhausted the\r\nlist. If, perchance, no one of the one hundred and forty-three distinct\r\ndenominations enumerated in the census tables shall suit him, there\r\nremain innumerable separate, independent congregations, no one of\r\nwhich lays claim to denominational name, creed, or connection, in some\r\none of which he yet may find an ecclesiastical home. The principle of\r\ndivision, indeed, has been carried so far in America that it would be a\r\ndifficult task to find the religious body so small as, in the judgment\r\nof some, to be incapable of further division.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CATHEDRAL OF ST. JOHN THE DIVINE (PROTESTANT EPISCOPAL)\r\nUNDER PROCESS OF ERECTION IN NEW YORK.]\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed, however, that the differences of the one hundred\r\nand forty-three denominations into which our religious population is\r\ndivided are, in many instances, so slight that, should consolidation\r\nbe attempted, the one hundred and forty-three could easily be reduced\r\nto a comparatively small number, and this with but little change\r\nin doctrine, polity, or usage. Consolidation into organic union,\r\nhowever, is hardly likely to occur in the near future, even were\r\nsuch consolidation desirable. In the first place such a result would\r\nbe contrary to the genius of Protestantism, based, as it is, on the\r\nabsolute right of private judgment with respect to matters of faith\r\nand morals, and, in the second place, it would be contrary to human\r\nexperience. “Religious controversies,” as Gladstone says, “do not, like\r\nbodily wounds, heal by the genial forces of nature. If they do not\r\nproceed to gangrene and mortification, at least they tend to harden\r\ninto fixed facts, to incorporate themselves into laws, character, and\r\ntradition, nay, even into language; so that at last they take rank\r\namong the data and presuppositions of common life, and are thought as\r\ninexorable as the rocks of an iron-bound coast.” In religion, when men\r\nseparate, the severance is like the severance of the two early friends\r\nof whom the poet speaks:—\r\n\r\n   “They parted, ne’er to meet again,\r\n      But neither ever found another\r\n    To free the hollow heart from paining.\r\n      They stood aloof, the scars remaining,\r\n    Like cliffs which have been rent asunder,\r\n      A dreary sea now rolls between.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FATHER DAMIEN, MISSIONARY TO HAWAIIAN LEPER COLONY.]\r\n\r\nIf, however, the diversities are great—increasing rather than\r\ndiminishing—the “unity of the spirit in the bonds of peace” with\r\nrespect to all essentials of doctrine is as remarkable as the diversity\r\nin the outward form. Never, indeed, since the dawn of Christianity,\r\nwere the members of the diversified bodies of the general church of\r\nChrist in such thorough accord, in such closeness of attachment,\r\nwith such generous recognition of all that is good in each of the\r\nseveral bodies, as now. Even the Roman Catholic Church, intolerant\r\nin all lands where its sway is practically undisputed, in the United\r\nStates, at least, has caught something of the broader toleration of\r\nProtestants, giving to its millions of communicants a better and truer\r\ngospel than in those countries where it does not come into contact with\r\nProtestantism, while freely coöperating with other churches in various\r\nworks of philanthropy and reform.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, that we are a religious, a Christian people may be\r\nargued from the steady and enormous increase during the century of the\r\nmaterial and spiritual forces of the church of Christ, an increase\r\nphenomenal even amid the wonders of a phenomenal century. Whether we\r\nlook at the increase of edifices or the multiplication of communicants,\r\nthe results in either case are sufficient for both congratulation and\r\namazement. Were it possible to obtain from the earlier records exact\r\nstatistics of the actual number of edifices and communicants existing\r\nat the opening of the century, comparison would be comparatively easy.\r\nSuch, however, is not the case, the records having been imperfectly\r\nkept and indifferently preserved. The census of 1890, indeed, was the\r\nfirst to furnish exhaustive and really reliable results.\r\n\r\nTaking that census as a basis, and adding to its figures those to be\r\nobtained from the year books of the various bodies up to and including\r\n1894, the religious strength of the United States may be summarized\r\nas follows: Churches, 189,488; religious organizations, 158,695;\r\nordained ministers, 114,823; members or communicants, 15,217,948;\r\nvalue of church property, $670,000,000; seating capacity of churches,\r\n43,000,000, while in the 23,000 places where organizations which own\r\nno edifices hold their services, accommodations could be found for\r\n2,250,000 more. In the majority of the Protestant churches, at least\r\ntwo services are held on each Sabbath; in the Catholic, six or seven.\r\n\r\nGranting these premises, it is but reasonable to say that if, on any\r\ngiven day, the entire population of the country should desire to attend\r\nat least one religious service, accommodations could readily be found\r\nfor the entire number,—ample proof that the spiritual interests of the\r\nmillions are by no means neglected so far as privileges of worship are\r\nconcerned. It is a showing all the more remarkable when we consider\r\nthat all this vast provision is furnished on the basis of voluntary\r\nofferings, the state contributing not a dollar for religious purposes.\r\nIt is probable that in these churches and edifices, on Sabbaths and\r\non weekdays, not less than 15,000,000 services are held each year, to\r\nsay nothing of sessions of Sunday-schools, meetings of Young People’s\r\nAssociations, and gatherings of kindred character. In them, too, not\r\nless than ten millions of sermons and addresses on religious themes are\r\nannually delivered.\r\n\r\nThe number of enrolled communicants, or members, however, by no means\r\nexpresses the real strength of the religious life of the nation. To\r\nget at that, we must multiply each Protestant communicant by the 2.5\r\nadherents allowed in all statistical calculations. Proceeding on this\r\nbasis, omitting for the time all Catholics, Jews, Theosophists, members\r\nof Societies for Ethical Culture, Spiritualists, Latter-Day Saints, and\r\nkindred bodies, and multiplying the 15,200,000 Protestant members by\r\n2.5, we have over 50,000,000 as the total Protestant population of the\r\ncountry. Adding to these 50,000,000 the Catholic population, estimated\r\nby Catholic authorities as being 15 per cent. larger than the number\r\nof Catholic communicants, we have 57,062,000 as the total Christian\r\npopulation, leaving only about 7,000,000 who are neither communicants\r\nnor adherents. Of the 7,000,000 opposed, for various reasons, to the\r\nchurches, comparatively few are to be reckoned as either infidels or\r\natheists; while, on the other hand, it is true that of the 57,000,000\r\nreckoned as either communicants or adherents, millions are Christians\r\nonly in name, either never attending the services of the churches, or\r\nat the best only at rare intervals. Gratifying as is this splendid\r\nexhibit of religious devotion on the part of the American people, the\r\nfact that there are millions in our land whose allegiance to Christian\r\ndoctrine is but nominal, with millions more upon whose lives religion\r\nexercises no appreciable influence whatever, is a sufficient proof of\r\nthe enormous task yet confronting the churches of Christ, if we are\r\nto stand before the nations as the great distinctive Christian nation\r\nof the world. The stupendous gain, however, in ninety-four years, of\r\nover 14,853,076 in Protestant churches alone is a record of religious\r\nprogress unparalleled in the history of the world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SALISBURY CATHEDRAL, ENGLAND. (WEST FRONT.)]\r\n\r\nAdvancing to the question of distribution of the religious forces\r\nenumerated, we find that while these forces are distributed throughout\r\nevery State and under one hundred and forty-three denominational\r\nnames, they are, nevertheless, massed largely in a few denominations\r\nand in a comparatively few States. Competent authorities estimate\r\nthat the five largest denominations comprise fully 60 per cent. of\r\nthe entire number of communicants; the ten largest, 75 per cent. With\r\nrespect to communicants, the Catholic Church is first, with 7,510,000;\r\nthe Methodist (all bodies) second, with 5,405,076; the Baptist third,\r\nwith 3,717,373; the Presbyterian fourth, with 1,278,332; the Lutheran\r\nfifth, with 1,233,072.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YOUNG MEN’S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION BUILDING,\r\nPHILADELPHIA.]\r\n\r\nWith respect to population, reckoning the Catholic population at\r\n7,510,000—which figures include children under ten years of age—and\r\nadding to the communicant strength of the four other bodies mentioned\r\nthe 2.5 adherents allowed for each communicant, we have the following:\r\nMethodist population, 18,918,466; Baptist, 12,990,805; Presbyterian,\r\n5,525,162; Lutheran, 4,358,752; total Protestant population,\r\n50,000,000; Catholic, 7,510,000.\r\n\r\nWith respect to value of church property, the Methodists are\r\nfirst with $132,000,000; the Catholics second, $118,000,000; the\r\nPresbyterians third, with $95,000,000; the Episcopalians fourth, with\r\n$82,835,000; the Baptists fifth, with $82,390,000. The total value of\r\nchurch property, reckoning all denominations, reaches the enormous sum\r\nof $670,000,000.\r\n\r\nTo further particularize with respect to the lesser groups into which\r\nthe religious forces are divided is impossible within the limits\r\nallowed for this chapter. To do it would require a volume instead of a\r\nchapter. The following summary, however, may suffice to show the gain\r\nof a century of religious effort:—\r\n\r\n  +-------+------------+----------------+--------------+\r\n  | Year. | Ministers. | Organizations. | Communicants |\r\n  |       |            |                |  or Members. |\r\n  +-------+------------+----------------+--------------+\r\n  | 1800  |    2,651   |      3,030     |     364,872  |\r\n  | 1850  |   25,555   |     43,072     |   3,529,988  |\r\n  | 1870  |   47,609   |     70,148     |   6,673,396  |\r\n  | 1880  |   69,870   |     97,090     |  10,065,963  |\r\n  | 1890  |   98,185   |    151,172     |  13,823,518  |\r\n  | 1894  |  114,823   |    158,695     |  15,217,948  |\r\n  +-------+------------+----------------+--------------+\r\n\r\nWhen one remembers that one hundred years ago it was a common boast of\r\ninfidels that “Christianity would not survive two generations in this\r\ncountry,” the above exhibit shows a religious progress unequaled in the\r\nhistory of the kingdom of God in any land or any age.\r\n\r\nTurning to the field of missionary effort, we find that the spread of\r\nthe Christian religion by missionary efforts, particularly during the\r\nlast one hundred years, forms one of the brightest chapters in the\r\nrecords of human progress. Within this period, the triumphs of the\r\nfirst three centuries have been far more than repeated.\r\n\r\nFollowing these early victories of the Christian faith came on, as all\r\nknow, ages of darkness, dreary centuries, during the progress of which\r\nthe power of the church gradually waned, and, with respect to purely\r\nspiritual activities, seemed to die away. The voice of exhortation\r\nceased to be heard. Christian song was hushed. Even prayer closed\r\nits supplicating lips, and the church, overladen with corruption,\r\nworldliness, and human ambition, passed into the thick darkness of\r\nthe long and disastrous eclipse of the Middle Ages. But amid the\r\nwidespread darkness enveloping the world, even the ages known as the\r\n“Dark Ages” were not without their gleams of light. Among the Saracens\r\nand in the lands of the Orient, always were to be found heroic men\r\nand women toiling ceaselessly for the conversion of heathen nations\r\nto the Christ. Later on, subsequent to the thirteenth century, and\r\nespecially during the centuries immediately following the discovery of\r\nthe New World, the desire for the Christianizing of the world flamed\r\ninto an all-absorbing passion. The tremendous labors of Xavier, of\r\nLoyola, and their followers, in every quarter of the globe, have long\r\nbeen the wonder and admiration of the world. Checked in Europe by the\r\nrise of the great Protestant Reformation, the Catholic Church turned\r\nits energies to the acquisition of spiritual power in other lands, and\r\nwith enormous success. Along the banks of the St. Lawrence, amid the\r\nwilds of Canadian forests, far away on the shores of the Great Lakes,\r\nthence southward to the Ohio, along the Mississippi, even to the Gulf;\r\nin far Cathay, in Ceylon, in Japan, in China, in Africa,—everywhere\r\nits missionaries could be found, heedless of hunger, of cold, of peril,\r\nreckless even of life, if by any means, whether by life or by death,\r\nthey might “sprinkle many nations” and establish the holy emblem of the\r\nChristian faith.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BAPTIST MISSION SCHOOL, JAPAN.]\r\n\r\nAbsorbed in the struggles going on in their own lands, Protestants made\r\nbut little effort for the extension of the gospel in foreign fields,\r\nsave the few but successful attempts made by the Moravians of Germany,\r\nalways the most zealous of all Protestant bodies in lines of missionary\r\nservice. What, however, was lacking in the way of missionary effort in\r\nthe seventeenth and eighteenth centuries has been more than made good\r\nin the glorious nineteenth, the distinctive missionary century of the\r\nChristian era. In the room of seven societies organized for world-wide\r\ngospel evangelization at the end of the last century, there are now in\r\nEurope and America between seventy and eighty organizations, employing\r\na force of nearly three thousand American and European missionaries,\r\nand perhaps four times that number of native assistants. Full\r\n$10,000,000 are annually raised among the Protestant bodies alone for\r\nmissionary service, while the great Roman Catholic Church prosecutes\r\nits work with a zeal equally unflagging. A brief survey of the progress\r\nof a hundred years of missionary effort will make it clear to all minds\r\nthat the day is not far distant when the declaration of the prophet,\r\n“The earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord,\r\neven as the waters cover the sea,” shall have abundant and magnificent\r\nrealization.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of this century, every island of the vast Pacific\r\nwas closed against the gospel. To-day, nearly every one is under\r\nthe influence, more or less extended, of Christian civilization.\r\nIndia, from Cape Comorin to the Punjaub, from the Punjaub to the\r\nHimalayas, from the Himalayas to Thibet,—at whose gates the gospel is\r\nnow knocking,—has been covered with a network of mission stations,\r\nschools, colleges, and churches, closer by far in its interlacings than\r\nthat which at the close of the third century had spread itself over\r\nthe vast empire of the Cæsars. Of the Indian Archipelago, Sumatra,\r\nJava, Borneo, the Celebes, New Guinea, not to mention smaller groups of\r\nislands, are feeling the new life ever imparted by the advent of the\r\nCross. Japan, too, hungry for reform, and full of the stir of the age,\r\nby granting entrance to the gospel, has within its borders already a\r\nnumerous Christian population with scores of evangelical congregations.\r\nThe same is true of the hermit nation, Corea. In the lands of Islam,\r\nfrom Bagdad to the Balkans, from Egypt to Persia, and throughout all\r\nTurkey, are to be found centres of missionary enterprise, the vast\r\ninfluence of which is now being sensibly felt in the changing life of\r\nthose remarkable peoples. In Burmah, and recently in Siam, after years\r\nof patient and apparently hopeless service, fields are everywhere\r\n“white unto the harvest.” China, most populous of all heathen lands,\r\nis open to missionary effort from Canton to Peking, from Shanghai\r\nto Hon-Chow. Africa also, once, in its northern sections at least,\r\nthe home of the learning, the art, the science, the religion of the\r\nworld, awakening from the sleep of long and dreary centuries under the\r\ninfluence of Christian civilization, again demands the attention of\r\nthe great nations of the world. Everywhere, east, west, north, south,\r\nit is being invaded all along the line of Cecil Rhodes’ great railway,\r\nstretching northward from Cape Town for three thousand miles, to meet\r\nthe twenty-six hundred pushing down from the north,—from Senegal to\r\nGaboon and from Gaboon to the Congo; on the shores of Tanganyika and\r\nalong the banks of the Zambesi shine the lights of the gospel, which,\r\nwherever it has gone, has been the harbinger of a new and brighter\r\nday. Within the mighty domains of our own continent, upon the immense\r\nplains reaching from Labrador to the Pacific, upon the sterile coasts\r\nof Alaska, in the land of the Montezumas, in Central America, in South\r\nAmerica, from Panama to Terra-del-Fuego, equally marvelous have been\r\nthe steady gains resulting from a Christianity the forces of which,\r\nlike the waters that enrich the continent, penetrate all the bays and\r\nestuaries of human society and influence all classes and conditions\r\nof men. Looking upon the transformations effected by the labors of a\r\nsingle century of Christian effort, one may surely say, “The peoples\r\nthat walked in darkness have seen a great light; they that dwell in the\r\nland of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined.”\r\n\r\nEqually wonderful have been the vast contributions of the church in\r\nAmerica to the great causes of education, philanthropy, and reform,\r\nparticularly in the line of educational work. The service of the church\r\nin the great cause of education has never yet been fully recognized.\r\nMen forget, when charging the church with hostility to human progress,\r\nto freedom of thought and action, that until within a period of\r\nseventy years nearly everything accomplished for popular education was\r\ncarried out under the auspices of the churches rather than under the\r\ndirection of the state. Until 1825, the state had done next to nothing\r\neven in the development of its common schools. In the great State\r\nof Pennsylvania, the system had no existence until the year 1835.\r\nEven to-day, among the four hundred and fifty institutions of higher\r\neducation in the various States, nearly all owe their foundation to\r\nthe energy and sacrifice of Christian men and women. The total gifts\r\nof the churches to the cause of education, still existent in plant, in\r\ngrounds and buildings, or in the form of endowment funds, reach the\r\nenormous aggregate of nearly $350,000,000, while the total of gifts to\r\ninstitutions of learning, largely from Christian sources, aggregate\r\nnearly $10,000,000 per year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: METHODIST EPISCOPAL HOSPITAL, PHILADELPHIA.]\r\n\r\nThe religious activity of the century is further manifested in the\r\nenormous sums raised and expended for purposes of charity, reform, and\r\ngeneral philanthropy. It would require an octavo volume of four hundred\r\npages to catalogue the various benevolent and charitable organizations\r\nin the city of New York alone. Add to that volume the hundreds more\r\nwhich would be required to enumerate the additional thousands to be\r\nfound in Philadelphia, Chicago, Boston,—in fact in every city, town,\r\nand hamlet from the Atlantic to the Pacific, nine tenths of which are\r\ndistinctively Christian,—and you have a faint idea, at least, of\r\nthe vastness of the spiritual forces at work in these closing years\r\nof the century for the amelioration of human ill, the dispelling of\r\nmoral and spiritual darkness, and the ushering in of the era of peace\r\nand good will, for the coming of which the church has so ceaselessly\r\nprayed. What these philanthropies are we cannot in detail enumerate.\r\nClassified, they are for the poor, for the laboring classes, for the\r\nsick, for fallen women, for free schools, for the aged, for the blind,\r\nthe deaf, the insane, the impotent, the degraded, the outcast, for\r\nsailors, for the protection of animals, for city evangelization, for\r\nhome missions, for foreign missions, for religious publications, for\r\nthe publishing of the Holy Scriptures, for peace, for Young Men’s\r\nAssociations, Young Women’s Associations, for every cause that appeals\r\nto the sentiment of brotherhood so characteristic of the age. In\r\nnumber they are legion. In origin, three fourths are the outgrowth of\r\nthat spirit of Christian love without which they could not have been\r\noriginated, and by which they are maintained and perpetuated. Those\r\nwho assert that within this century Christianity has done more for\r\nhumanity than in all the centuries preceding are doubtless correct. It\r\nhas made men kind, made them humane. It has penetrated prisons, and\r\nwith beneficent change. It has lifted the prisoner from damp and dreary\r\ndungeons into commodious structures, the pride of city and State. So\r\nfar, indeed, have the reforms inspired by the gospel been carried, that\r\nmen are beginning to inquire whether the limit has not been reached\r\nbeyond which it may be dangerous to go.\r\n\r\nSuch are the general facts of the religious progress of a century in\r\nthe United States. Reviewing them, we can easily discern the vast\r\nand commanding influence of religion—the Christian religion—upon\r\nthe character and fortunes of our people. Among the forces working\r\nfor the upbuilding of the Republic, religion stands preëminent, the\r\nmost powerful, the most pervasive, the most irresistible of them all.\r\nA free church in a free state, all its edifices have been built by\r\nprivate contribution, all its magnificent benefactions sustained by\r\nvoluntary offerings, induced in every instance by the principle of\r\nChristian love. A corporation, it holds its vast properties for the\r\ncommon good of all. A relief society, the scope of its sympathies\r\nis as wide as the wants of man. A university, it does more for the\r\neducation of the masses than the public school system itself. An\r\nemployer of labor, it utilizes the brains and energies of the most\r\nhighly educated body of men to be found in the Republic’s broad domain.\r\nAn organized beneficence, it outwatches Argus with his hundred eyes,\r\noutworks Briareus with his hundred arms. An asylum, it gathers within\r\nits protecting arms the halt, the maimed, the wounded of life’s great\r\nbattle, comforting them in trouble, sustaining them in adversity,\r\nwhile ceaselessly pointing them to Him “who taketh away the sins of\r\nthe world.” “Every corner-stone it lays,” as one has said, “it lays\r\nfor humanity; every temple it opens, it opens for the world; every\r\naltar it establishes, it establishes for the salvation of men. Its\r\nspires are fingers pointing heavenward; its ministers are messengers\r\nof good tidings; its ambassadors, ambassadors of hope; its angels,\r\nangels of mercy.” Under all our institutions rest the Bible and the\r\nschool-house,—Christianity and Education. Without them, the Republic\r\nis impossible; with them, we have Republican America for a thousand\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREAT GROWTH OF LIBRARIES\r\n\r\nBY JAMES P. BOYD, A.M., L.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nLibraries are as old as civilization. Nothing marks civilized progress\r\nmore distinctly than the collections of writings, whether on clay,\r\nstone, wood, papyrus, or parchment, which went to make up the libraries\r\nof ancient peoples. Such writings generally related to religion,\r\nlaws, and conquests, and found their abode, in the form of archives,\r\nin capitals and temples. Recent explorations in Mesopotamia reveal\r\ncollections, or libraries, of books inscribed on clay tablets, many of\r\nwhose dates are beyond 650 B. C. These libraries seem to have found a\r\nhome for the most part in royal palaces, and to have contained works\r\nabounding in instruction for the kings’ subjects. As unearthed and\r\ntheir contents deciphered, they throw much valuable light upon the\r\nremote history, as well as the arts, sciences, and literatures of\r\nBabylonia and Assyria.\r\n\r\nIn ancient Egypt collections of hieroglyphic writings were made in\r\ntemples and in the tombs of kings from the earliest known dates. Some\r\nhieroglyphics still extant bear date prior to 2000 B. C., and one\r\npapyrus manuscript has been discovered whose supposed date is 1600\r\nB. C. What were known as the sacred Books of Thoth—forty-two in\r\nnumber—constituted the Egyptian encyclopædia of religion and science,\r\nand became such a fruitful source of commentary and exposition, that by\r\nthe time of the Grecian conquest they had grown in number of volumes to\r\n36,325.\r\n\r\nOf the libraries of the Greeks we have little positive knowledge,\r\nthough it is abundantly asserted by late compilers that large\r\ncollections of books (writings) once existed in the various Grecian\r\ncities. Pisistratus is said to have founded a library at Athens as\r\nearly as 537 B. C. Strabo says that Aristotle collected the first\r\nknown library in Greece, which he bequeathed to Theophrastus (B. C.\r\n322), and which, by the vicissitude of war, finally found its way to\r\nRome. At Cnidus there is said to have existed a special collection of\r\nworks upon medicine. Xenophon speaks of the library of Euthydemus.\r\nEuclid and Plato are mentioned as book collectors. But by far the most\r\nrenowned book collectors of the Greeks were the Ptolemies of Egypt, who\r\ngathered from Hellenic, Hebrew, and Egyptian sources that wonderful\r\ncollection of volumes, or rolls, which became famous as the Alexandrine\r\nLibrary. This was composed of two libraries, one estimated at 42,800\r\nvolumes, or rolls, connected with the Academy, the other estimated at\r\n490,000 volumes, or rolls, deposited in the Serapeum. It is said that\r\nthese immense collections were regularly catalogued and kept under the\r\nsupervision of competent librarians, till consumed by the Saracens at\r\nthe time of their conquest of Egypt, A. D. 640.\r\n\r\nThe Romans at first paid little attention to literature. It is not\r\nuntil the last century of the republic that we hear of a library at\r\nRome, and then it was not a native collection but a spoil of war. It\r\nwas captured from Perseus of Macedonia and brought to Rome in B. C.\r\n167. So Sulla captured the library of Apellicon, at Athens, in B. C.\r\n86, and brought it to Rome. Lucullus brought to Rome a rich store of\r\nliterature from his eastern conquests (B. C. 67). Wealthy men and\r\nscholars now began to form libraries at Rome, some of which became\r\nvery large and valuable. It is here we first hear of the dedication\r\nof libraries to the public,—a step which made Rome for a time the\r\nresort of scholars from other nations, especially Greece. The most\r\nfamous of the many imperial libraries of Rome was that founded by\r\nUlpius Trajanus. It was called the Ulpian Library, and was at first\r\nfounded in the forum of Trajan, but afterwards removed to the baths of\r\nDiocletian. In the fourth century there are said to have been as many\r\nas twenty-eight public libraries in Rome. Great, indeed, must have been\r\ntheir destruction under various vicissitudes, for when the Emperor\r\nConstantine moved the Roman capital to Constantinople, and founded his\r\nimperial library there, it numbered but a few thousand books. It was,\r\nhowever, greatly enlarged after his death—some say to 100,000 volumes.\r\nIt was destroyed in A. D. 476, with the close of the Western Empire.\r\n\r\nWith the spread of Christianity there arose a new incentive to write\r\nand collect books. The church required both a literature and libraries\r\nas part of its organization. Pamphilus is said to have collected a\r\nlibrary of 30,000 volumes, chiefly religious, at Cæsarea (A. D. 309),\r\nhis object being to lend them out to readers. But as book-making and\r\ncollecting became narrowed to the church, general literature was\r\nproscribed and libraries ceased to flourish, except as encouraged by\r\nthe monastic orders. Such libraries were necessarily small and of a\r\nprivate character. Their books were manuscripts written or copied by\r\nthe priests, up to the date of the invention of printing. The libraries\r\nof this class which grew in importance were those of the Swiss and\r\nIrish monasteries, not omitting those in England, as at Canterbury and\r\nYork. The invasion of the Norsemen, in the ninth and tenth centuries,\r\nwas generally fatal to the monastic libraries on both sides of the\r\nEnglish channel.\r\n\r\nIn France, the library at Fulda seemed to retain its books and respect.\r\nIt was greatly enlarged by Charlemagne, who also founded a more\r\nostentatious one at Tours. With the revival of learning, and with the\r\nhope of opening a wider field to secular literature, Charles VI., of\r\nFrance, founded a royal library which numbered 1100 volumes by A. D.\r\n1411. A similar library in England, that of the British crown, numbered\r\n329 volumes at the time of Henry VIII. In contrast with these early\r\nroyal efforts stood that of Corvinus, king of Hungary, whose library\r\nnumbered 50,000 volumes, mostly manuscripts, in 1490. This imperial\r\ncollection was burned by the Turks in 1540. About this time the nucleus\r\nof the modern Laurentian Library of Florence was formed.\r\n\r\nIn 1556, the Bibliothèque Nationale, or royal library of France, at\r\nParis, was endowed by the king with power to demand a copy of every\r\nbook printed in France. This power became the basis of the copyright\r\ntax, now universally levied by civilized nations, and which has been\r\nthe means of greatly enriching all government libraries. In 1556 the\r\nroyal library of France could boast of but 2000 volumes. In 1789 it\r\ncontained 200,000 volumes, the largest number of any library then\r\nexisting. At the end of the nineteenth century it still retains\r\nthe distinction of being the most extensive library in the world,\r\ncontaining approximately 3,000,000 volumes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NEW LIBRARY OF CONGRESS, WASHINGTON, D. C.]\r\n\r\nIn Italy the libraries, though venerable and very rich in rare\r\ncollections of manuscripts, are not noted for the number of books which\r\nrepresent modern literature. The most noted library is the Biblioteca\r\nVaticana, or library of the Vatican. It traces a vague history back to\r\nthe fifth century, but its real foundation was in 1455. The number of\r\nvolumes and manuscripts on its shelves is approximately 300,000.\r\n\r\nIn Spain and Portugal are national libraries in their respective\r\ncapitals, Madrid and Lisbon. The national library of Spain contains\r\nsome 560,000 volumes and manuscripts, while that of Lisbon contains\r\nover 200,000. Belgium and Holland are rich in libraries. The royal\r\nlibrary at Brussels contains over 400,000 volumes. In 1830 it was\r\nmade a part of the state archives and thrown open to the public. The\r\nnational library of Holland was established in 1798 by uniting the\r\nlibrary of the princes of Orange with the smaller libraries of the\r\ndefunct states. It thus became the library of the States-General,\r\nbut in 1815 it was converted into the present national library. It\r\nhas a very valuable collection of books, numbering over 400,000. One\r\nof the best arranged and managed libraries in Europe is the Royal\r\nLibrary at Copenhagen. It was thrown open to the public in 1793, and\r\nhas since been conducted under national auspices. Two copies of every\r\nbook published in the kingdom must be deposited in this library. Its\r\nvolumes have increased very rapidly during the nineteenth century, and\r\nnow number over 550,000. The Royal Library of Sweden is located at\r\nStockholm. It contains over 350,000 valuable volumes, and is admirably\r\narranged and conducted. The University Library at Upsala is also a very\r\nvaluable one, containing 300,000 volumes. There is also an excellent\r\nlibrary of over 100,000 volumes connected with the university at Lund.\r\nThe libraries of Norway, though not so large as those of Sweden,\r\nare numerous, valuable, and well managed. The University Library at\r\nChristiana contains over 330,000 volumes. In Russia, large and valuable\r\nlibraries are not numerous outside of the cities of St. Petersburg,\r\nMoscow, and Warsaw. The Imperial Library at St. Petersburg ranks as the\r\nrichest in Europe, excepting the libraries of Paris and the British\r\nMuseum. It is open to the public, and contains approximately 1,200,000\r\nvolumes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RIDGWAY BRANCH OF PHILADELPHIA LIBRARY.]\r\n\r\nGermany, with her multiplicity of minor capitals, her love of books and\r\nbook-making, her numerous universities, excels every other European\r\ncountry in the number, extent, and value of her libraries. The largest\r\nis the Royal Library at Berlin, with approximately 1,000,000 volumes.\r\nIt was founded by the “Great Elector” Frederick William, and opened\r\nas a public library in 1661. The Royal Library at Munich long rated\r\nas the largest in Germany, with its 1,200,000 volumes, inclusive of\r\npamphlets, the latter numbering some 500,000. But it was thought to\r\nbe unfair to class so many small and inconsequential works as books,\r\nso that the library at Berlin was given precedence. Still the Munich\r\nlibrary is particularly rich in incunabula and other treasures derived\r\nfrom the monasteries, which were closed in 1803. The University library\r\nat Munich is also very rich in similar treasures. It contains well\r\nnigh 500,000 volumes. The other large libraries of Germany are the\r\nUniversity library at Leipsic, with over 500,000 volumes; the Royal\r\nand City library at Augsburg, with 123,000; the Royal, at Bamberg,\r\nwith 300,000 volumes; the University at Bonn, with 220,000 volumes;\r\nthe Grand Ducal at Darmstadt, with 400,000 volumes; the Royal Public,\r\nat Dresden, with 410,000 volumes; the University at Erlangen,\r\nwith 185,000 volumes; the City, at Frankfort, with 190,000 volumes;\r\nthe University at Freiburg, with 250,000 volumes; the University at\r\nGiessen, with 160,000 volumes; the Ducal Public, at Gotha, with 210,000\r\nvolumes; the Royal University at Göttingen, with 490,000 volumes; the\r\nCity at Hamburg, with 510,000 volumes; the University at Heidelberg,\r\nwith 410,000 volumes; the University at Jena, with 200,000 volumes;\r\nthe University at Kiel, with 225,000 volumes; the University at\r\nRostock, with 310,000 volumes; the University at Strassburg, with over\r\n700,000 volumes; the University at Tübingen, with 320,000 volumes;\r\nthe Grand Ducal at Weimar, with 230,000 volumes; the Brunswick Ducal,\r\nat Wolfenbüttel, with over 300,000 volumes. Besides these there are\r\nnumerous others attached to various universities or publicly organized\r\nwhich have 100,000 volumes each.\r\n\r\nIn Austria-Hungary, the largest library is that of the Imperial Public,\r\nat Vienna. It was founded in 1440 by Emperor Frederick III., and\r\nhas ever since been munificently supported by the Austrian princes.\r\nFew libraries in Europe contain more important collections or are\r\nbetter organized and housed. Its volumes number 540,000. Admission\r\nto its reading room is free, but the books are loaned out under\r\nrigid restrictions. The University Library of Vienna was founded by\r\nMaria Theresa, and has grown very rapidly, numbering nearly 500,000\r\nvolumes. In Vienna alone the number of libraries exceed one hundred,\r\nmany of them of considerable extent. The various university libraries\r\nthroughout Austria-Hungary are rich in volumes, particularly that at\r\nCracow, with over 306,000 volumes, and at Innsbruck, with 175,000\r\nvolumes. The National Library at Budapest, Hungary, and also the\r\nUniversity at the same place, have rich collections, numbering 465,000\r\nand 212,000 volumes respectively.\r\n\r\nIn Switzerland libraries are very numerous and well conducted. The\r\nlargest is that at Basel. It is called the Public University Library,\r\nand numbers 187,000 volumes. The next largest is the City Library, at\r\nZurich, with 135,000 volumes. The smaller libraries of Switzerland\r\nexceed two thousand in number, and are, as a rule, rich in literary\r\ntreasures descended from the ancient monasteries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PUBLIC LIBRARY OF THE CITY OF BOSTON.]\r\n\r\nThough by no means as ancient as some others, the leading library\r\nof Great Britain, and the second in extent and importance in the\r\nworld,—the National, at Paris, France, being first,—has had a\r\nphenomenal growth. It is located at London, and is known as the British\r\nMuseum. It dates from 1753, when Parliament purchased, for £20,000, the\r\nSir Hans Sloane collection, and afterwards consolidated therewith many\r\nother valuable collections. It was given the privilege of copyright,\r\nby which means, and by frequent and fortunate private bequests of\r\nbooks, it grew apace and became a national repository, not only of\r\nhome-written works, but of the literature and rarities of all nations.\r\nThe number of its volumes at present exceeds 1,650,000. London does not\r\ncontain many public libraries, but there are numerous collections of\r\nscientific and special works of great value to those pursuing certain\r\nlines of knowledge. The second largest and most important collection in\r\nEngland is that of the Bodleian Library of Oxford, with some 530,000\r\nvolumes; followed by that of the University of Cambridge, with some\r\n510,000 volumes. Next in extent and importance in Great Britain is\r\nthe library of the Faculty of Advocates, in Edinburgh, Scotland.\r\nIt dates from 1682, and contains at present about 400,000 volumes.\r\nThe library of Trinity College, Dublin, was founded contemporaneously\r\nwith the Bodleian, and easily ranks as the largest and most important\r\nin Ireland, with its 200,000 volumes, to which about 3000 are added\r\nannually. What has been said of the dearth of public libraries in\r\nLondon is in part true of all Great Britain. There are not a score of\r\nlibraries in all her European domain that number over 100,000 volumes,\r\nand it is only within the nineteenth century that the public or free\r\nlibrary system began to grow in favor. Indeed, such growth may be\r\nsaid to date from as late a period as 1850, when the Manchester Free\r\nReference Library was established. It has shown in fifty years a most\r\nmarvelous growth, and contains at present some 255,000 volumes.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain has not neglected to encourage the use of libraries among\r\nher colonists. At Ottawa, Canada, is the library of Parliament. It was\r\nfounded in 1815, and grew slowly till 1841, when the two libraries of\r\nUpper and Lower Canada were consolidated. It was subsequently destroyed\r\nby fire, and in 1855 reëstablished. Since then it has grown rapidly,\r\nand at present contains over 150,000 volumes. The Laval University\r\nlibrary, at Quebec, is the next most extensive in Canada, containing\r\nover 100,000 volumes. The South African Public Library was founded at\r\nCape Town in 1818, and has grown to contain some 50,000 volumes, many\r\nof them of great importance as bearing on the languages and customs\r\nof African peoples. In Australia are many libraries of considerable\r\nextent, whose volumes are, as a rule, free to all readers. The largest\r\nof these is at Melbourne, and is called the Public Library of Victoria.\r\nIt is a collection of considerably over 150,000 books and pamphlets,\r\nmany of which relate to Australasian themes. The Sidney Free Public\r\nLibrary is next to that at Melbourne in importance. It is said to\r\ncontain the largest collection of works special to Australia in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe book collections of China, and indeed throughout the Orient, are\r\nby no means inconsiderable, and the favorite works relate to religion,\r\nphilosophy, poetry, history, and the sciences. They are generally large\r\nand of encyclopædic style and proportions. Thus a Chinese history of\r\nnational events from the third century B. C. to the seventeenth A. D.\r\noccupies sixty-six volumes, as bound in European style for the British\r\nMuseum. Libraries in Japan are more numerous, convenient, and extensive\r\nthan in China and elsewhere in the Orient. The University library at\r\nTokio, Japan, contains well nigh 200,000 volumes.\r\n\r\nOf South American libraries the largest is the National, at Rio\r\nJaneiro, Brazil, with some 240,000 volumes. The other republics of\r\nSouth America which passed through their wars for independence and\r\ntheir formative periods, not to say their internal jealousies and\r\nstrifes, during the nineteenth century, have had but little opportunity\r\nor inclination to collect large libraries. Yet the spirit of education\r\nis by no means dormant, and the nuclei of many libraries have been\r\nformed, in which much pride is taken, and which bid fair to grow great\r\nin importance as scholarship expands and other fostering conditions\r\ncome to prevail more generally. Even in the small and tumultuous\r\nrepublics of Central America there are some valuable collections of\r\nbooks which, in the course of time, will be greatly augmented and\r\nprove a source of literary and national pride. Notwithstanding all the\r\nups and downs of the Mexican republic during the century, she has,\r\nsince the separation of church and state in 1857, evolved a creditable\r\neducational system, and built up many excellent libraries, especially\r\nin the capital, Mexico. The largest of these is the National, which\r\ncontains over 100,000 volumes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN RUSSELL YOUNG.\r\n\r\nFirst Librarian of New Library of Congress.]\r\n\r\nThe growth of libraries in the United States during the nineteenth\r\ncentury has been phenomenal. If its leading libraries have not yet\r\nmatched those of the old world in extent, they are, nevertheless,\r\nunique in their freshness, exceptional in their number, original in\r\ntheir systems, and most effective in their uses. And what is here said\r\nof the leading libraries is still more true of the smaller, for in no\r\ncountry has the library system so ramified as in the United States,\r\nand come down to such close touch with the people. Not only cities,\r\ntowns, and even villages have their libraries, but States, schools, and\r\nmyriads of special organizations, all of which are centres of culture\r\nand sources of literary pride.\r\n\r\nThe oldest library in the United States is that of Harvard College. It\r\nwas founded in 1638, and was destroyed by fire in 1764. It was speedily\r\nrestored, and became the recipient of many private donations, which\r\nnot only greatly increased the number of its volumes, but placed it\r\nin possession of a handsome endowment fund. Since its removal to Gore\r\nHall, in 1840, it has been open to the public for reading within its\r\nwalls, but only the students of the university and other privileged\r\npersons may borrow books. Its present collection numbers over half\r\na million of volumes of books and pamphlets. In the year 1700, two\r\nother libraries were founded,—that of Yale College, and that which\r\nafterwards became known as the New York Society Library. The first of\r\nthese grew very slowly until the beginning of the nineteenth century,\r\nwhen it took on new life, and at the end of the century contains\r\nsome 250,000 volumes. The latter also grew very slowly, and in 1754\r\nbecame a subscription library. It is peculiarly the library of the old\r\nKnickerbocker families and their descendants, and the number of its\r\nvolumes gravitates around 100,000.\r\n\r\nIn 1731, Benjamin Franklin projected what he called a “subscription\r\nlibrary” at Philadelphia. It was incorporated as the Library Company\r\nof Philadelphia, and grew rapidly through bequests of books and money.\r\nIn 1792 it absorbed the very valuable Loganian Library, and in 1869\r\nDr. Benjamin Rush left a bequest of over $1,000,000 to found its\r\nRidgeway Branch. The building erected for this purpose is, with the\r\nexception of the new Library of Congress structure at Washington, the\r\nhandsomest, most commodious, and best arranged for library purposes\r\nof any in the United States. The collection of the Library Company of\r\nPhiladelphia, commonly called the Philadelphia Library, now numbers\r\nwell nigh 200,000 volumes. Of the sixty-four libraries in the United\r\nStates reported to have been founded before the year 1800, thirty were\r\nestablished between 1775 and 1800. The more important of these—that\r\nis, those which rank as 20,000-volume libraries and over—are the\r\nMassachusetts Historical Society Library, at Boston, founded in 1791;\r\nthe Georgetown College Library, at Georgetown, D. C., founded in 1791;\r\nthe Dartmouth College Library, at Hanover, N. H., founded in 1769; the\r\nColumbia College Library, New York City, founded in 1754; the library\r\nof the College of Physicians, at Philadelphia, founded in 1789; the\r\nCollege of New Jersey Library, at Princeton University, founded in\r\n1746; the Brown University Library, at Providence, R. I., founded in\r\n1768; the Department of State Library and House of Representatives\r\nLibrary, Washington, D. C., founded in 1789; the Williams College\r\nLibrary, at Williamstown, Mass., founded in 1793.\r\n\r\nFrom this standpoint we get a fair view of the tremendous strides of\r\nlibrary growth in the United States during the nineteenth century. The\r\nsixty-four libraries of 1800 have grown to well nigh four thousand, not\r\ncounting those of less than 1000 volumes; and the less than 500,000\r\nvolumes of 1800 have increased to well nigh 30,000,000, omitting\r\nthose in libraries of less than a thousand volumes. Over six hundred\r\nlibraries in the United States take rank as 20,000-volume libraries\r\nand over, at the end of the century; and in the six statistical years\r\nbetween 1888 and 1893, which mark the greatest ratio of increase in\r\nvolumes, there was a growth equal to 66 per cent over all that had\r\npreceded.\r\n\r\nNor has the century been more triumphant and wonderful in the\r\naccumulation of volumes and the number of book repositories than\r\nin the variety of systems and multiplicity of agencies by means of\r\nwhich library information is arranged and disseminated. Conspicuous\r\namong these has been the inauguration and growth of the free library\r\nsystem, by means of which public funds are provided for the support\r\nof libraries whose use is free to all. Hardly less conspicuous, and\r\nperhaps even more far reaching, has been the adoption by many States\r\nof the school-district library system, which draws upon a certain\r\nproportion of the school fund for the collection and maintenance of the\r\ndistrict library. Again, most of the States have established libraries\r\nof their own for public use, and as centres to which may be gathered\r\nand whence may be disseminated the knowledge that appertains to the\r\nrespective State localities. Special library systems have grown into\r\ngreat favor, covering and encouraging collections of historic works,\r\nof scientific literature, of information relating to law, medicine,\r\ntheology, etc. In fact, there is hardly a line of investigation and\r\nmental activity that has not come to be represented in its library\r\ncollections.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CARNEGIE FREE LIBRARY, PITTSBURGH, PA.]\r\n\r\nAt the head of all the century’s library triumphs in the United States\r\nstands the Library of Congress. It is the national repository, and\r\nis to the country what the British Museum is to Great Britain and\r\nthe Bibliothèque Nationale is to France. It was founded in 1800,\r\nwhen the seat of government was moved to Washington. In 1814 it was\r\nburned by the British soldiers, its home being then in the Capitol,\r\nwhich was also destroyed. The government purchased Thomas Jefferson’s\r\ncollection of 7000 volumes as the nucleus of a new library. This grew\r\nto contain 55,000 volumes by 1851, when all but 20,000 volumes were\r\nagain destroyed by an accidental fire. In 1852 it was refitted, the\r\ngovernment appropriating $75,000 for the purpose. On the restoration of\r\nits halls in the Capitol, in fire-proof form, it began to grow rapidly\r\nin volumes. In 1866, it received the 40,000 volumes which constituted\r\nthe library of the Smithsonian Institute. In 1870, the privilege of\r\ncopyright was transferred to it from the Patent Office. This, together\r\nwith the annual appropriation made by Congress, served to give it a\r\nmore rapid growth than ever, and to nationalize its importance. It\r\nspeedily grew rich in collections of history, science, law, and every\r\nbranch of literature appertaining to this and other countries. Under\r\nits privilege of copyright, two copies of every volume desiring such\r\nprotection are required to be deposited within it. It must, therefore,\r\nere long become quite fully representative of the literary productions\r\nof the country. In 1882, it was augmented by the presentation of the\r\nprivate collection of the late Dr. Joseph M. Toner, of Washington,\r\ncontaining 27,000 volumes and nearly as many pamphlets. By 1890 it had\r\noutgrown its ability to accommodate its collections, and Congress made\r\na very liberal appropriation for the erection of a new and separate\r\nlibrary building, which was completed and occupied by 1897–98, the late\r\nHon. John Russell Young being its first librarian. It is the largest,\r\nmost elegant, and best fitted repository of books in the world, being\r\ncapable of accommodating over 2,000,000 volumes. The public are\r\nprivileged to use its books within the building, but only members of\r\nCongress and certain designated officials of the Departments may take\r\nthem away. It is open from 9 A. M. to 4 P. M., except upon Sundays and\r\nother legal holidays. Its location is on Capitol Hill, quite contiguous\r\nto the Capitol itself.\r\n\r\nA pioneer of the system of free libraries, and the one which comes next\r\nto the Library of Congress in the number of its volumes, is the Public\r\nLibrary of Boston, founded in 1848. It has had a phenomenal growth,\r\nand is the centre of a wide range of literary influence. Its numerous\r\nbranches extend throughout the city and surrounding towns, bringing\r\nfree reading to every locality. The number of its volumes exceeds\r\n700,000. The free library system stands sponsor for a host of libraries\r\nthroughout the larger cities. The Public Library of Cincinnati was\r\nfounded upon this basis in 1867. It at once attained great popularity\r\nand speedily grew till, by the end of the century, its volumes\r\nnumbered approximately 220,000. The same popularity and rate of growth\r\ncharacterized the Public Library of Chicago and that of Philadelphia.\r\nThe former was founded in 1872, and now contains over 220,000 volumes.\r\nThe latter was not founded until 1891, but by the year 1900 it grew\r\nto contain 203,102 volumes, with fifteen branches, or divisions,\r\nthroughout the city, and an annual circulation of 1,778,387 volumes.\r\n\r\nOther libraries of the United States founded or rehabilitated during\r\nthe nineteenth century, and which ere its close have taken rank as\r\nlibraries containing over 100,000 volumes, are the New York State\r\nLibrary, at Albany, with approximately 190,000; the State Library at\r\nAnnapolis, Md., with 100,000 volumes; the Enoch Pratt Free Library,\r\nat Baltimore, with 165,000 volumes; the Peabody Institute Library, at\r\nBaltimore, with 125,000 volumes; the Athenæum Library, at Boston, with\r\n185,000 volumes; the City Library, at Brooklyn, N.Y., with 120,000\r\nvolumes; the University Library, at Chicago, with nearly 400,000\r\nvolumes; the Newberry Library, at Chicago, with 125,000 volumes; the\r\nPublic Library at Detroit, with 135,000 volumes; the Cornell University\r\nLibrary, at Ithaca, N. Y., with 175,000 volumes; the library of the\r\nState Historical Society, at Madison, Wis., with 110,000 volumes; the\r\nMercantile Library, at Philadelphia, with 175,000 volumes; the library\r\nof the University of Pennsylvania, with 120,000 volumes; the Astor\r\nLibrary, New York City, with 265,000 volumes; the Mercantile Library,\r\nNew York City, with 250,000 volumes; the Public Library at St. Louis,\r\nMo., with 105,000 volumes; the Sutro Library, at San Francisco, with\r\n210,000 volumes.\r\n\r\nOf those libraries founded during the century in the United States,\r\nand which have secured a rank as over 20,000-volume libraries, there\r\nare very many that approach the 100,000 mark, and their average of\r\nvolumes would gravitate around 50,000. It is by no means true that the\r\nimportance and usefulness of a library must be measured by its number\r\nof volumes. Very many of the best managed, serviceable, and popular\r\nlibraries contain even less than 20,000 volumes.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of knowledge which has created in the United States such\r\na demand for libraries has been happily supplemented by a spirit of\r\nliberality. Nowhere in the world have there risen so many and such\r\nmunificent donors of means to found and support libraries. Without\r\nappearing invidious, mention may well be made of some of these\r\nmunificent givers and founders. Conspicuous among them is John Jacob\r\nAstor, founder of the Astor Library in New York City, with its splendid\r\nendowment fund of $1,100,000; James Lenox, who founded the Lenox\r\nLibrary of New York City, and invested in buildings and endowment\r\n$1,247,000; George Peabody, who founded, in 1857, at Baltimore, the\r\nPeabody Institute and Library, with an endowment of $1,000,000; Walter\r\nL. Newberry, of Chicago, who, in 1889, left $2,000,000 to found a\r\nfree public library in the northern part of the city; John Crerar,\r\nof Chicago, who left an immense estate to found and endow the Crerar\r\nLibrary; Enoch Pratt, of Baltimore, who gave $1,150,000 to found the\r\nEnoch Pratt Free Library; Dr. James Rush, of Philadelphia, who left, in\r\n1869, a bequest of over $1,000,000 to form the Ridgway Branch of the\r\nPhiladelphia Library; Andrew Carnegie, who founded the Pittsburgh Free\r\nLibrary and several others in different places.\r\n\r\nThe century’s progress in library management has kept pace with the\r\ngrowth of volumes. Cataloguing and arranging of books have been reduced\r\nto a science. Training of librarians and of students in the use of\r\nbooks has become an educational course in many higher institutions\r\nof learning. Library architecture and the numerous appliances for\r\ndistributing books or rendering them accessible on the shelves, have\r\nall been improved, so that the library of the end of the century is as\r\nmuch a seductive retreat as a world of knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGRESS OF THE CENTURY IN ARCHITECTURE\r\n\r\nBY WILLIAM MARTIN AIKEN, F.A.I.A.,\r\n\r\n_Former U. S. Supervising Architect_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the last century there arose in England a decided\r\nfashion for Greek columns and pediments, which was brought about by\r\nthe publication in 1762 of the discoveries by Stuart and Revett at\r\nAthens, and was still further stimulated by the bringing to England of\r\nthe Elgin marbles in 1801, so that every building of any importance,\r\nwhether church or school or country residence, had its portico with\r\nDoric, Ionic, or Corinthian columns. Thus began the Greek revival;\r\nthen followed the more slender columns, with arches and vaults, of the\r\nRoman; and to these were very shortly added the cupola or the dome and\r\nthe balustrade of the Renaissance.\r\n\r\nIn London, the Bank of England by Sir John Soane, the British Museum by\r\nRobert Smirke (a pupil of Soane’s), the University by Wilkins, were all\r\nbuilt early in this century, as were the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge,\r\nand the High School at Edinboro, magnificent colonnades adorning\r\nthe front of each. St. Pancras Church, in London, has a spire of\r\nsuperimposed copies of the Temple of the Winds at Athens—each smaller\r\nthan the one beneath it,—and there are side porches which reproduce\r\nthe caryatid portico of the Pandroseum. But the most successful\r\nbuilding in England which was designed upon Greek lines is St. George’s\r\nHall, Liverpool, which has a central hall lit from above; at either end\r\nis a court-room, and beyond, at one end, is an Odeon, or Music Hall.\r\n\r\nThe taste for classical design gradually declined in England, and a new\r\ncult was assiduously propagated through the writings of Pugin, Brandon,\r\nRickman, and Parker, whose text was that classicism represented\r\npaganism, and this, together with the remodeling of Windsor Castle,\r\nin 1826, by Sir Jeffrey Wyatville, caused a general interest in the\r\nrevival of Gothic architecture; for some time, however, much illiterate\r\nwork was done in the adjustment of old forms to new conditions.\r\n\r\nThroughout the last half of this century, the battle of the styles\r\nhas been maintained by the adherents of the differing schools with\r\nvarying success, and, although there may be notable examples to the\r\ncontrary, it has virtually resulted in the adoption of Gothic designs\r\nfor ecclesiastical buildings, conditions being much the same as\r\nformerly for these structures; whereas, for secular buildings, with\r\never-changing requirements, the classic or the Renaissance, which has\r\nshown even greater pliability, has been considered more appropriate.\r\n\r\nAmong those whose success has been greatest in Gothic work may be\r\nmentioned Sir Charles Barry, who was knighted for designing the\r\nParliament Buildings, begun in 1840 and completed twenty years later;\r\nGeorge Gilbert Scott, who did the Assize Courts, in Manchester, and New\r\nMuseum, Oxford; George Edmund Street, whose Law Courts in London are so\r\nfull of defects in plan yet so excellent in details; Alfred Waterhouse,\r\nwhose interesting (Norman) Museum of Natural History gave substantial\r\nencouragement to the use of terra cotta; T. G. Jackson, the author of\r\nmuch collegiate architecture at Oxford and elsewhere; J. L. Pierson,\r\nthe designer of eight churches in London; William Burgess, Sir Arthur\r\nBlomfield, and James Brooks, all well known for the high character\r\nof their work, as is also J. D. Sedding, whose broad sympathies and\r\nrefined spirit ranked him as one of the most talented men of his day.\r\n\r\nThe first international exposition was held in London in 1851, and\r\nthe single building in which it was contained was perhaps the most\r\nmarvelous exhibit. It was designed by Sir Joseph Paxton, and was the\r\nfirst example of the use of iron and glass on a scale of such gigantic\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\nThe so-called “Victorian Gothic” was used to a great extent for secular\r\nwork as late as 1870, and as it was much stimulated by the writings\r\nof Street upon Spain and Northern Italy and by Ruskin’s “Stones of\r\nVenice,” there were frequent attempts at polychromy, shown in the use\r\nof different colored stone, brick, and terra cotta, and, in the Albert\r\nMemorial, by means of mosaic.\r\n\r\nR. W. Edis and E. W. Godwin were among the foremost practitioners of\r\nthe time, but in spite of the cleverness and boldness of design shown\r\nin some of their city and suburban buildings, neither they nor others\r\ncould prolong the life of the fashion, and it presently yielded to the\r\nrevival of a previous one, and the Renaissance forms of the time of\r\nQueen Anne became the vogue, especially for country houses,—nowhere\r\nmore homelike than in England.\r\n\r\nIn the suburb of Bedford Park, in Lowther Lodge, as in his designs\r\nfor the Alliance Assurance Company and the new Scotland Yard, Norman\r\nShaw showed the facility of his clever pencil, and Ernest George Peto\r\ngave many evidences of his skill and taste; their work, however, often\r\nhaving a flavor of the Flemish.\r\n\r\nThe building of the Thames Embankment, the opening of new\r\nstreets,—such as Holborn Viaduct and Shaftesbury Avenue,—with\r\nthe widening and straightening of others, have done much for the\r\nimprovement of modern London.\r\n\r\nIn France, there were very many important public buildings begun in\r\nthe first ten years of this century,—during the reign of Napoleon\r\nI.,—although some of them were not completely finished until the\r\ntime of Napoleon III. (1848–1870). Among those in Paris were the Arc\r\nde l’Étoile by Chalgrin, the largest triumphal arch ever built, being\r\nsimilar in height and width to the front of Notre Dame Cathedral,\r\nomitting the upper portion of the towers; Arc du Caroussel by Percier\r\n& Fontaine—both these arches commemorating the victories of Napoleon;\r\nthe churches of the Madeleine by Vignon, and of Ste. Geneviève, in\r\nhonor of the great men of France; and the wing connecting the palaces\r\nof the Tuileries with the Louvre, parallel to (but furthest from) the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nThe Corps Législatif, which was formerly the Palais Bourbon, was\r\nremodeled in 1807 by Poyet, and has for its river front a portico with\r\npediment sustained by twelve columns, a greater number than any other\r\nexisting building can show.\r\n\r\nIf there be one style more than any other which needs sunshine and a\r\nclear atmosphere to show it to advantage, it is the classic; and a\r\nGreek or Roman temple in the atmosphere of fog, rain, and snow, of\r\nEdinboro, London, Munich, or even Paris, does not produce at all the\r\nsame impression as if it were under the blue skies of Italy, Sicily, or\r\nGreece; however, the frequent employment of classical _motifs_ since\r\nthe beginning of the century has contributed, to a degree unprecedented\r\nin modern times, towards placing Paris in the very foremost rank among\r\nthe capitals of the world in the dignity and impressiveness of its\r\npublic buildings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARC DE L’ÉTOILE, PARIS.]\r\n\r\nThe encouragement given to architecture in France by Napoleon I. was\r\nrevived by Napoleon III. The remodeling of the streets, avenues, and\r\nboulevards of Paris, under the direction of Baron Hausmann, while it\r\nswept away many landmarks of mediæval Paris, contributed wonderfully\r\nto its stately elegance as well as to its hygiene; the work begun\r\nupon the Louvre was completed from designs by Visconti & Lefuel, and\r\nmuch entirely new work erected. There was a group of men, some of\r\nwhom brought about the Neo-Grec movement, whose work was especially\r\ninteresting, and although not extensively copied, yet exerted a marked\r\ninfluence for many years afterwards. These men were Labrouste, who\r\ndesigned the Library of Ste. Geneviève, about 1830; Duc, who remodeled\r\nthe Palais de Justice; Duban, who built the library for the School of\r\nFine Arts, about 1845; Viollet le Duc, who restored the Château de\r\nPierrefonds, and wrote treatises and dictionaries upon architecture,\r\nfurniture, etc., and was instrumental in the organization of the\r\nSociety for the Preservation of Historical Monuments.\r\n\r\nStill later than these works are Vaudremer’s Neo-Grec Church of St.\r\nPierre de Montrouge, built in 1860, and Abadie’s Byzantine Church of\r\nthe Sacred Heart, still unfinished; Baltard’s Church of St. Augustin,\r\nof brick and cast-iron, and Central Market, of cast-iron and glass;\r\nGarnier’s Opera House, Hitorff’s Northern Railway Station; the\r\nTrocadéro, built for the Exposition of 1878; the Machinery Hall and\r\nEiffel Tower, for that of 1889; together with a host of other public\r\nbuildings, not only in Paris, but in other portions of France, many of\r\nwhich have served as examples to the student of architecture in other\r\nlands.\r\n\r\nIn this connection we should not forget the debt we owe to the French\r\nnation. During the reign of Louis XIV. the School of Fine Arts was\r\nfounded in Paris, where free instruction in painting, sculpture, and\r\narchitecture is still given to all who pass satisfactorily the entrance\r\nexaminations; and in this school many of our successful architects\r\nhave received gratuitous instruction from some of the distinguished\r\nmen above mentioned. In the Department of Architecture the chief\r\ncharacteristics are the thorough and systematic study of the plan, and\r\nthe adaptation of building materials to the conditions of the design.\r\n\r\nOther European cities besides Paris have profited by the general\r\nprosperity of the century. St. Petersburg produces the effect of a city\r\nof palaces, the many residences of grand dukes and nobles, the number\r\nof public institutions, the riding schools,—much used on account\r\nof the severity of the climate,—and even the barracks, in spite of\r\nthe free use of stucco, each contributing to a certain impression of\r\nstateliness; the palace of the Archduke Michael, built by an Italian,\r\nRossi, in 1820, is perhaps the most refined and dignified. Muscovite\r\narchitecture is most conspicuous in the elaborate and bulbous domes,\r\ncurious not only in form, but in color, of the churches of St.\r\nPetersburg, of Moscow and Warsaw.\r\n\r\nKing Louis of Bavaria, having lived in Rome when Crown Prince,\r\ncultivated so great a fondness for the architecture of Greece and\r\nItaly, that when he came to the throne he commissioned his architects\r\nto design for his capital city of Munich the Walhalla, Ruhmeshalle,\r\nGlyptothek, and Pinakothek, after classical models.\r\n\r\nIn Dresden, the most interesting buildings designed upon Greek or\r\nItalian traditions are the theatre and the picture gallery, by Semper,\r\nwho will long be ranked as the foremost German architect of his day.\r\n\r\nIn Berlin there is a theatre,—unique of its kind, with stage in the\r\ncentre, and an auditorium for winter use at one end and one for summer\r\nat the other,—designed by Titz; at Carlsruhe, Stuttgart, and Strasburg\r\nthere are theatres and schools in the same style. The present Emperor\r\nhas added many schools throughout the empire, but they are of late\r\nGerman Renaissance.\r\n\r\nThe public buildings of Germany and Belgium show few designs of\r\ninterest in recent years; the Parliament House at Berlin, by Wallot,\r\nand the Palais de Justice at Brussels, by Polaert, being colossal in\r\nmass and clumsy in detail. Many of the private houses designed in the\r\nItalian Renaissance were very elegant and attractive, but within the\r\npast decade there has been a woeful deterioration in the character of\r\nboth surface and line—the grotesque replacing the graceful.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM, KENSINGTON, LONDON.]\r\n\r\nThe villages built for their employees by Krupp, the gun manufacturer,\r\nand Stumm, the maker of steel, are notable instances of the application\r\nof private capital to the improvement of the domestic conditions of\r\nthe laboring class.\r\n\r\nIn Austria, Vienna has developed wonderfully since the days of Maria\r\nTheresa. The classic Parliament House by Hansen, in 1843, is one of\r\nthe most delightful of its kind to be found anywhere; Schmitt’s Gothic\r\ntown-hall is interesting, but cannot be said to be so successful in\r\ndesign; the Votive Church by Ferstel, in 1856 (also Gothic), the\r\nOpera House by Siccardsburg and Van der Nüll, with the City Theatre,\r\nan elaborate Renaissance structure, by Semper and Hasmauer, are all\r\nworthy of note. The University with the two Museum buildings, facing\r\neach other upon a small park, and other public buildings and residences\r\nalong the Ring Strasse, are extremely satisfactory, in spite of the\r\nfact that stucco has been so extensively employed.\r\n\r\nOnly a few years ago the municipality of Buda-Pesth offered immunity\r\nfrom taxation for fifteen years to all prospective builders, under\r\ncertain conditions as to character and cost of buildings, with the\r\nresult that the newer portion of the Hungarian capital was quickly\r\noccupied by buildings of the most desirable kind; the Parliament\r\nHouse, Opera, Cathedral, Technical School, and several club-houses and\r\nprivate residences, each testify to the spirit with which the citizens\r\nresponded to this desire to beautify the city.\r\n\r\nSince the unification of Italy there has been considerable building in\r\nsome of the principal cities, but very little of special importance.\r\nIn Rome, the changes are more perceptible than elsewhere; the\r\nexcavations of the Forum, the embankment of the Tiber, the widening and\r\nstraightening of the Corso, and the opening of the Via Nationale and\r\nother streets, have destroyed comparatively little of the picturesque\r\nthat was worth retaining, have brought to light many treasures of art,\r\nand, supplemented by the drainage of the Campagna by Prince Torlonia,\r\nhave certainly made it a healthier city to live in. The monument to\r\nVictor Emmanuel, the National Museum, and the Braccia Nuovo of the\r\nVatican Museum, are among the few public structures of interest; the\r\nmany blocks of apartments and tenements are orderly and inoffensive,\r\nthough brick and stucco are the materials used in their construction.\r\n\r\nTurin is the modern manufacturing city, while Florence preserves its\r\nmediæval air, and Venice dreams of the bygone days when the splendor of\r\nthe Renaissance attracted the wealth, beauty, and talent of all Europe\r\nto the city of the Doges.\r\n\r\nBologna and Genoa have each built in the suburbs a magnificent Campo\r\nSanto, or cemetery, with chapels, colonnades, and other accessories of\r\narchitectural value; in Milan and Naples there are lofty glass-covered\r\narcades through the centre of a block and connecting with cross\r\nstreets, and the semi-circular colonnades of St. Francesco di Paolo, at\r\nNaples, surround a piazza which is the great public resort of summer\r\nevenings.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of King George a new Athens has sprung up alongside\r\nof and overlapping the old city; although the nation is not wealthy,\r\nthe individual bequests of certain Greeks have given her the Museum,\r\nUniversity, and Academy, each of strict classic design, and a hospital\r\nof Byzantine design. Under the sunny skies of Greece those buildings\r\ncertainly appear to much greater advantage than if in a more northern\r\natmosphere, and their statuary and polychromy show the value of these\r\naccessories to such architecture in this climate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WHITE HOUSE, WASHINGTON, D. C.]\r\n\r\nAbdul Aziz, the predecessor of the present Sultan of Turkey, had so\r\ngreat a fondness for building that his extravagance in this respect was\r\none of the causes which led to his downfall. The Dolma Bagtche palace,\r\nerected directly upon the shores of the Bosphorus from the designs of\r\nBalzan, an Armenian architect, suggests Spanish work of the sixteenth\r\ncentury. In Constantinople and at Therapia,—a summer resort at the\r\nnorthern end of the Bosphorus,—many of the foreign governments have\r\nbuilt official residences for their representatives.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GLASS COVERED ARCADE, MILAN.]\r\n\r\nAs for the architecture of our near neighbors on the north, the\r\nbuildings of Canada have been sturdy and substantial rather than\r\ncomely; but the long continuance of cold weather and the lack of means\r\nhave often hampered the builders. Since the completion of the Canadian\r\nPacific Railroad, the prosperity of city and country seems more\r\nassured; the older cities growing in importance and extent, and new\r\ntowns springing up along the line to the West. In Ottawa the Parliament\r\nBuildings and the octagonal Library, in Toronto, and, to some extent,\r\nin Montreal, the Universities’ buildings, are Victorian Gothic. The\r\nlater buildings of the University in Montreal, excepting the Girls’\r\nCollege, are not so interesting; but there are two railroad stations,\r\na hotel, cathedral, with several banks, insurance buildings, and\r\nresidences that call for more than passing notice. Perhaps the finest\r\nbuilding in all Canada is the Château Frontenac, in Quebec,—built by\r\nBruce Price of New York,—on the Dufferin Terrace, overlooking the St.\r\nLawrence River, and commanding a view that is hardly surpassed on the\r\nBosphorus, the Rhine, or the Hudson.\r\n\r\nAlthough the history of architecture in America cannot be written\r\nwithout some reference to contemporary work in Europe,—since so\r\nmuch of our architecture in the first half of the century is adopted\r\nfrom that of our ancestors and adapted to our uses, and in the last\r\nhalf so many of our architects have studied there and so many of our\r\ncitizens have traveled there,—the problems and their conditions in\r\nthe Old World are very different from those of the New. Europe was\r\nalready mature when steam and electricity were introduced; precedent\r\nwas always to be considered, and modern requirements were often forced\r\nto conform to existing circumstances. There has, therefore, been\r\ncomparatively less change there during the century than during the past\r\nthirty years with us. With our republican institutions, many of the\r\nmonarchical formulas soon became obsolete, though the general trend\r\nof our architecture has been in the direction of classic models. As\r\nthe country has grown larger and more wealthy, the problems given to\r\narchitects have become more complex; less reliance could be placed upon\r\nprecedent and a premium was placed upon originality, which, in spite of\r\ninnumerable vagaries, has brought American architecture, at the end of\r\nthe century, to be the most notable of the day.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the eighteenth century, this republic consisted of hardly\r\nmore than a number of communities extending at intervals along the\r\nAtlantic seaboard, with an occasional settlement beyond the Alleghany\r\nMountains and across the Ohio River. Their resources were extremely\r\nlimited, their wants very few, and their intercommunication irregular;\r\nbut their methods of living were simple and frugal, and their courage\r\nand endurance phenomenal.\r\n\r\nAmong the settlers of New England were many mechanics and\r\nmanufacturers, and these soon began to replace the primitive log\r\ncabins with frame dwellings; those of the Southern States were chiefly\r\nplanters, who imported much of their labor, and often the bricks as\r\nwell as the glass, hardware, tiles, and other materials for their\r\nhouses. Many of those who colonized the Middle States had come from\r\ncountries in Europe where these materials were made, and brought their\r\nsecrets with them, while others were farmers and stock growers, whose\r\nsnug little cottages and enormous barns may be seen to this day in New\r\nYork and Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century we possessed a national\r\nstyle of architecture, which, although it had come to us from Italy,\r\nthrough France and England, was yet distinctly American. It was,\r\nhowever, almost exclusively confined to residences, and there were very\r\nfew public buildings of any description, except certain churches,—said\r\nto have been designed by followers of Sir Christopher Wren, some of\r\nwhom were doubtless ship carpenters who had studied the works of Sir\r\nWilliam Chambers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE UNITED STATES CAPITOL, WASHINGTON, D. C.]\r\n\r\nThe Colonial style, as we now term it, was sufficiently elastic in\r\nits adaptability to conform to the requirements of the merchant,\r\nmanufacturer, or mariner living at Salem, Boston, or Newport, as well\r\nas to those of the planter living at Charleston or Savannah. There were\r\ncertain differences, more or less pronounced, peculiar to each section\r\nand to each city, but all houses were alike in this respect,—there was\r\nno gas or water, and the open fireplace was depended upon for heat.\r\n\r\nIn New England the dwelling-houses were placed near the ground; the\r\nchimneys built in an interior cross wall, the kitchen, with its\r\naccessories, as near to the dining-room as possible; the ceilings\r\nwere low, with cornices sometimes of plaster, sometimes of wood. The\r\nroof,—which was often hipped and often of the gambrel shape, but\r\nrarely a gable of even slope,—was always covered with shingles, which\r\ncovering was occasionally used also on the exterior walls.\r\n\r\nIn the South, some of the characteristics were the high basement, broad\r\npiazzas, frequently at the level of the second as well as the first\r\nstory, and placed on the south and west sides; the chimney on outside\r\nwalls; the kitchen in a separate building, detached from the dwelling;\r\na broad hall through the centre, giving access to large rooms with high\r\nceilings; the roof quite as frequently hipped as gabled, and often—in\r\neither case—a huge fanlight set in a low gable on the front for\r\nventilation of the attic; dormers were seldom used, as the attic was\r\nnot inhabited; the gambrel roof was uncommon; slate, and occasionally\r\ntile or shingle, was used for roof covering.\r\n\r\nOur first public buildings of any importance, and which show the\r\ninfluence of contemporary work in England, were the White House,\r\ndesigned by Hoban in 1792; the Capitol, begun by Dr. Thornton in\r\n1793 and completed by B. H. Latrobe in 1830; the wings, containing\r\nthe present Senate and House of Representatives, were added later;\r\nthe dome, designed by Thomas U. Walter, was begun in 1858, but not\r\ncompleted until 1873.\r\n\r\nOur early Presidents took much interest in architecture, Washington\r\ndirecting and criticising the planning of the Capitol and building\r\nhis own home at Mount Vernon, and Jefferson designing the dome and\r\ncolonnades of the University of Virginia, at Charlottesville, and his\r\nown home at Monticello.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts was the first State to erect its capitol,—the State\r\nHouse in Boston, by Bulfinch, dating from 1795.\r\n\r\nThe City Hall of New York was our first work of unmistakable French\r\ncharacter, and shows the influence of the time of Louis XVI. It was\r\ndesigned by Mangin, a Frenchman, begun in 1803, and completed in 1812.\r\n\r\nAfter the war of 1812, many state and national buildings were erected;\r\nfrom that time colonnades and domes seem indispensable to the proper\r\ndignity of the capitol or court house. The use of both brick and stone\r\nbecame more general, and, for private houses, the form of the gambrel\r\nroof gradually disappeared in favor of the hip and gable. Subsequent\r\nto 1830, the accepted type of the larger or more pretentious house was\r\nthe Italian villa, with a square tower accentuating the front entrance,\r\noften one story higher than the main building; all roofs of low pitch,\r\ncovered with tin; the exterior walls faced with stucco. About this time\r\nbay windows and sliding doors for principal rooms of first story, and\r\nbetter facilities for the use of heat, light, and water were introduced\r\nand the symmetrical disposition of parts often neglected.\r\n\r\nThe very steep pointed Gothic roof denoted the modest cottage,\r\nand the perforated wooden tracery of windows and porches, or the\r\nbarge-boards of gables, became the simple beginning of that riotous\r\ngrowth of jig-sawed fretwork afterwards so prominent upon those houses\r\nconstructed with Mansard or French roofs of rectilinear, concave, or\r\nconvex form. The works and writings of Downing had much influence at\r\nthis time, and it was shown not only in these Italian villas or Gothic\r\ncottages, but also in landscape gardening about suburban residences.\r\n\r\nThe political disturbances in various countries of Europe in 1848\r\nbrought very many immigrants to our shores, and the discovery of gold\r\nin California, in 1849, was the beginning of that steady flow of\r\nsettlers which has since then peopled so many of our Western States and\r\nTerritories.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LIBRARY BUILDING, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA.\r\n\r\n(Thos. Jefferson, Designer.)]\r\n\r\nThen followed our own Civil War, from 1861 to 1865, and subsequent to\r\nthat the period of reconstruction, during which time there was some\r\nbuilding, but very little architecture, throughout the country.\r\n\r\nIn 1869 the Pacific Railroad was completed, and this not only gave a\r\nnew impetus to Western mining and farming, but created a new market for\r\nEastern manufactures.\r\n\r\nSo great was this manufacturing and commercial activity that vast\r\nfortunes were made, and there were many opportunities calling for\r\nthe services of architects; but as they had hitherto been rarely\r\nemployed, except in a few of the larger cities, upon churches or\r\npublic buildings, a great proportion of them were untrained amateurs\r\nor self-taught carpenters and masons. However, the first school of\r\narchitecture had just been organized at the Massachusetts Institute of\r\nTechnology, in Boston, and to William E. Ware,—who was its professor\r\nof architecture from 1866, and who organized a similar school at\r\nColumbia College, New York, in 1880,—the profession and the public owe\r\nmore than to any other one man for well-directed efforts towards the\r\ndevelopment of such, qualifications as may eventually give a national\r\ncharacter to our architecture. These schools came none too soon, and\r\nwithin the past twenty-five years many others have been founded and\r\nmany traveling scholarships endowed; collections of books, photographs,\r\nand casts have been provided in various cities; architectural\r\nperiodicals published, and architectural societies and sketch clubs\r\nformed, each of which has contributed to the higher education of the\r\nprofession and to the greater appreciation by the public.\r\n\r\nPrior to this time, each section and each city had certain\r\npeculiarities of architecture, as of speech, which were unmistakable.\r\nThe white New England meeting-house, the red school-house, the country\r\nhouse with its kitchen, wash-room, and wood-shed trailing in the\r\nrear, or the swell-front city house, were as characteristic as the\r\nendless blocks of brown stone, high stoop houses of New York, or the\r\nmonotonous rows of red brick dwellings with white marble trimmings of\r\nPhiladelphia, or the broad verandas and halls of the Southern home.\r\n\r\nCast-iron was the recognized material for the front of business\r\nbuildings, the designs being chiefly in the Corinthian or composite\r\norders, and the arch or lintel used indiscriminately; and when the dry\r\ngoods store of A. T. Stewart & Co. was built, in 1872, to occupy the\r\nwhole block from Broadway to Fourth Avenue, and from Ninth to Tenth\r\nStreets, it was the largest and most important of its kind. Before this\r\nclass of commercial architecture disappeared, a front was designed\r\nby R. M. Hunt, about 1878, for a store on Broadway, near Broome\r\nStreet, where the plastic forms of the tile and stucco of Saracenic\r\narchitecture were used as being more logical for this material than an\r\nimitation of Roman forms in stone.\r\n\r\nThere were not many summer resorts, and a few weeks at Saratoga,\r\nNewport, or the Virginia Springs was the limit of the annual vacation;\r\nthe orthodox hotel was a rectangular frame building, with veranda on\r\none or more sides, covered by a flat roof supported by square piers\r\nhaving the height of several stories; the length, width, and height\r\nof the building were governed by no other proportion than that of the\r\nnumber of guests.\r\n\r\nIn the South and West there were virtually no hotels, and the belated\r\ntraveler applied for food and shelter for himself and his horse to the\r\nnearest friendly farm.\r\n\r\nThese were the prevailing conditions when the _nouveau riche_ appeared\r\nupon the scene; to him as citizen prosperity meant a better home, to\r\nthe congregation a larger church, to the community a new city hall or\r\ncourt house, to the State a more expensive capitol.\r\n\r\nWhile these buildings were being everywhere erected, in accordance\r\nwith the time honored fashions of construction and with elaborate\r\nfinish, the disastrous conflagrations of 1871 in Chicago, and of 1872\r\nin Boston, called general attention to the necessity for more permanent\r\nbuilding; and the precautions now taken against similar occurrences\r\nwere the beginning of efforts toward methods of fireproof construction.\r\nGranite, marble, and limestone were discarded in favor of sandstone,\r\nbrick, and terra cotta; iron beams carrying brick or concrete\r\n(subsequently hollow terra cotta) arches were introduced, and metal\r\nlaths were substituted for the wooden strips to a certain degree; but\r\nas these fires were mainly in the business districts, such reforms have\r\nbeen confined almost exclusively to commercial architecture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRINITY CHURCH, NEW YORK.]\r\n\r\nIn 1873 the financial panic gave a check to many building operations,\r\nbut it was of comparatively short duration, for in 1876 all the other\r\nnations of the earth were invited to unite with us at Philadelphia in\r\ncelebrating the centennial anniversary of our independence.\r\n\r\nThis was our first international Exposition, and it was not remarkable\r\nthat in our eagerness to learn, and in the enthusiasm of prosperity, we\r\nsought inspiration from all those peoples who had brought their goods\r\nfor our inspection. At once we began to build Queen Anne cottages or\r\nto remodel existing houses with many bays and towers, rooms set at all\r\nangles, floors at different levels, walls of many materials, and roofs\r\nof varying slopes, as well as to apply many tints and shades of color\r\nwithin and without.\r\n\r\nThe summer hotel and summer cottage began to appear at the seashore,\r\nin the mountains, and along the shores of the great lakes, and the\r\nwinter resorts of the Carolinas, Florida, and California to attract the\r\nseekers for health and pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe interior decoration of our houses was the chief lesson of 1876, and\r\nhaving once seen the European and Oriental hangings, draperies, rugs,\r\nand bric-à-brac, we set about furnishing our rooms with them.\r\n\r\nHitherto American architecture had been most influenced by English\r\nprecedent, and the Victorian Gothic had able advocates, especially\r\nin Boston, where the Art Museum by Sturgis & Brigham, as well as\r\nmany stores, residences, and churches by Cummings & Sears, Peabody &\r\nStearns, and others, showed much vigor and originality. William A.\r\nPotter, as supervising architect for the Government, adopted this\r\nstyle, in 1875, for his buildings at Fall River, Mass., Nashville,\r\nTenn., and Covington, Ky., and R. M. Upjohn designed for Hartford,\r\nConn., the only Gothic State Capitol in this country.\r\n\r\nR. M. Upjohn and Henry M. Congdon of New York had already done much\r\nGothic ecclesiastical work and, with the possible exception of\r\nGrace Church in 1840, and St. Patrick’s Roman Catholic Cathedral in\r\n1886 by Renwick, there is no example of this style which shows such\r\nappreciation of proportion or of form, in mass and in detail, as\r\nTrinity Church (1843) by the first-named architect.\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps rather fortunate that just as the Queen Anne fashion,\r\nwith its multiplicity of detail, was brought to us from England, H. H.\r\nRichardson, of Boston, called our attention to the bigness and (almost\r\nbrutal) simplicity of the Romanesque from Southern France. From the\r\ndate of the building of Trinity Church, in Boston (1876), may be\r\nreckoned the parting of the ways. Heretofore everything we had done of\r\nany importance had an English stamp upon it; henceforth the work that\r\nwas done showed the result of training of the Parisian _atelier_ or of\r\nthe well-filled sketch books of Continental travel.\r\n\r\nNot only in this church, but in his libraries at Woburn, North Easton,\r\nQuincy, Milford, Burlington, and New Orleans, did Richardson show his\r\ngrasp of the subject. Trinity is unmistakably a Christian temple, and\r\nits bigness most conducive to the sense of awe and reverence. His\r\nlibraries leave no doubt as to their having been built for the storing\r\nand reading of books; his stone buildings, whether the Court House and\r\njail in Pittsburg, the Chamber of Commerce in Cincinnati, or private\r\nhouses in Buffalo or Chicago, show their purpose and emphasize their\r\nmaterial; his brick buildings, whether a college building at Cambridge,\r\nrailway station at New London, or residence at Washington, tell their\r\nstory in brick; and his country houses about the suburbs of Boston, to\r\nbe what they are, could not have been other than of wood.\r\n\r\nHis influence upon the architecture of the day was therefore not\r\nsurprising, but there was a subtleness in the character of his\r\ndesigns that his imitators could never acquire and even his immediate\r\nsuccessors could not long retain after his personality was lost to\r\nthem; and from the lack partly, perhaps, of true sympathy, partly from\r\nthe modification of conditions, his art may be said to have died with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ST. GEORGE’S HALL, PHILADELPHIA.]\r\n\r\nAs R. M. Hunt had the last word on the cast-iron front, so he had the\r\nfirst on the modern sky-scraper, a peculiarly American production; the\r\nwalls of the Tribune Building, however, carry both their own weight,\r\nand that of the floors, being built before the days of the methods\r\nof steel skeleton construction. Hunt was trained in Paris, as was\r\nRichardson, and had assisted in the design of the Pavillon de Flore\r\nunder Lefnel, and he showed his appreciation of the Neo-Grec movement\r\nin his design for the Lenox Library. It is somewhat unusual for an\r\nartist to do his best work in his latest years, but surely no better\r\nwork of its kind has been done in modern times than the residences\r\nwhich he designed for three members of the Vanderbilt family at\r\nNewport, in New York city, and at Biltmore, N. C. The design which he\r\nleft for the Fifth Avenue front of the Metropolitan Museum, now being\r\ncarried out by his son, is a magnificent Corinthian order, whereas much\r\nof his other work is late French Gothic.\r\n\r\nThat he was called upon to design the base for Bartholdi’s Liberty in\r\nNew York Harbor, and the Administration Building at the International\r\nExposition of 1893, and that a portrait bust has been erected to his\r\nmemory, all testify to the appreciation in which he was held by the\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\nTo McKim, Mead & White, of New York, we are greatly indebted for their\r\ninfluence upon secular architecture, and their Casino at Newport, built\r\nin 1880, was probably more far-reaching in its effect upon country\r\nhouses than any other building at that time. Among the other work from\r\ntheir office may be mentioned the Boston Public Library, the Madison\r\nSquare Garden (reproducing in its tower the Giralda of Seville), the\r\nLibrary and other buildings for Columbia College, the Metropolitan and\r\nUniversity Clubs, the Agricultural Building (of staff) in Chicago in\r\n1893, now being reproduced in marble for the Brooklyn Institute, the\r\nTiffany, the Villard, and other city houses, and a host of country\r\nhouses at Newport, Lenox, and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThere is another architect whose talents should be acknowledged; for\r\nabout 1880, when the shingle house had just begun to take shape, there\r\nwas none more clever at that sort of thing than W. R. Emerson, of\r\nBoston, and his resources seemed endless in harmonizing form and color\r\nwith conditions of seashore or mountain, as shown in his houses at Bar\r\nHarbor, Milton, Newport, and many other summer resorts.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, which had hitherto always been extremely conservative\r\nin architecture, soon began to erect some of the most singular and\r\nfantastic structures that could well be imagined; but fortunately the\r\nrefined simplicity and fertile originality of such men as Wilson Eyre,\r\nFrank Miles Day & Bro., and Cope & Stewardson have prevailed, and in\r\nboth city and suburban work they and certain others have done and\r\nare doing much to counterbalance the character of the eccentricities\r\nof their predecessors, as shown in buildings for the University of\r\nPennsylvania and the Academy of Arts and Sciences.\r\n\r\nBut the restless activity of Eastern loom and machine shop, and of\r\nWestern farm and mine, seemed to meet and concentrate in Chicago—the\r\n_entrepôt_ for the raw material of the West and the finished product of\r\nthe East. The unprecedented increase in value of land, the low price of\r\niron and steel, with the introduction of high-speed elevators, combined\r\nto develop a new type of sky-scraper; and as the nature of the soil\r\nwas entirely unlike that of other cities, the foundations of these\r\nbuildings presented problems which were solved by Chicago architects in\r\nvarious ways hitherto untried. The Rookery by Burnham & Root, Pullman\r\nBuilding by S. S. Beman, and the Auditorium (opera house, hotel, and\r\noffice building in one) by Adler & Sullivan, at the time of their\r\ncompletion were most notable examples of architectural engineering,\r\nand were soon followed by many others more or less similar, designed\r\nby W. L. B. Jenny, Holabird & Roche, Henry Ives Cobb, and others.\r\nThe buildings for the Chicago University, the Athletic Club, and\r\nNewbury Library, by the last-named architect, show a high degree of\r\nability; the peculiarly rich arabesque ornamentation designed by Louis\r\nH. Sullivan, and the direct and rational handling of the buildings\r\nupon which it was used, are certainly indicative of the spirit of\r\nenthusiasm and conscientiousness of a well-trained mind. It is by such\r\ncharacteristics that John W. Root was able to accomplish so much for\r\nthe advancement of architecture in the West.\r\n\r\nWhat Krupp and Stumm had done for the employees in their works in\r\nGermany, Pullman determined to do for his men and their families here;\r\nand a town, with dwellings, schools, churches, water-works, etc., for\r\nmany thousand inhabitants was designed and built by S. S. Beman, which\r\nhas been reported by experts to be the best of its kind.\r\n\r\nIn Chicago, in 1893, was held our second international Exposition; and\r\nthat the exhibits should be suitably housed, some of the most prominent\r\narchitects of the country were called together, buildings were assigned\r\nto each of them, and Frederick Law Olmsted was appointed to lay out the\r\ngrounds, waterways, and bridges.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRINITY CHURCH, BOSTON.]\r\n\r\nExcept for the difference in material, never did Rome in the days of\r\nAugustan magnificence show buildings similar to those grouped about the\r\nCourt of Honor. A Greek would surely have been proud to walk through\r\nthe Peristyle, or to have visited the Art Galleries, and a Roman to\r\nhave sauntered about the Terminal Station or the triumphal arches of\r\nthe Manufactures Building. Right nobly was the Spanish aid to Columbus\r\nacknowledged in the design of Machinery Hall; but to France, whose\r\ngenerosity had trained so many of our architects, sculptors, and\r\npainters to do such things, was the greatest triumph in the unanimity\r\nwith which they had all worked and the success which crowned their\r\nlabors.\r\n\r\nThe building occupied by the Federal Government was one of the few\r\nunworthy of its location or of the occasion. While the architecture of\r\nthe people had been advancing steadily for fifty years, that provided\r\nby the Treasury Department in Washington had been quite as steadily\r\nretrograding. The Custom House, Boston; Sub-Treasury, New York;\r\nthe Mint, in Philadelphia; the Treasury, Post Office, and Interior\r\nDepartment buildings, in Washington, have stood almost alone since the\r\nmiddle of the century. The few Gothic buildings referred to previously\r\nwere honest and intelligent attempts to improve the quality of design\r\nfor the government, but the politicians decided that artistic ability\r\nwas not a prerequisite for the office of Supervising Architect.\r\n\r\nSince 1895, there has been some infusion of new life into the\r\ndesigning-room, and such work as the designs by William Martin Aiken,\r\nfor the Buffalo and San Francisco Post Offices and Court Houses, the\r\nDenver and the Philadelphia Mints, and the New London Post Office, were\r\nabout being materialized, when once again the politicians, who cared\r\nnot a whit for one design more than another, interfered to oblige the\r\ngovernment contractor. But the good seed had been planted, and the work\r\nof the present incumbent, James Knox Taylor, is likely to show a marked\r\nadvance over that of many previous years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE AMERICAN SURETY COMPANY’S BUILDING, NEW YORK.]\r\n\r\nThe general scheme of the Congressional Library was conceived by\r\nSmithmeyer & Pelz, the details carried out subsequently by General\r\nCasey and his able assistants and successors, and the building opened\r\nto the public in 1896. The experiment of the collaboration of sculptor\r\nand painter with the architect had resulted so favorably in Chicago,\r\nthat the artists invited to decorate this building gladly responded;\r\nand although the remuneration was inconsiderable, their loyalty to\r\nthe country, as to Art, resulted in such mural decoration as had not\r\nbeen seen since W. M. Hunt decorated the Senate Chamber in Albany, or\r\nLa Farge did the figures in Trinity Church, Boston, and St. Thomas\r\nChurch, New York. Blashfield’s dome, typifying all the nations of the\r\nearth; Vedder’s Minerva, in mosaic; H. O. Walker’s large lunettes,\r\nillustrating English poems, and Simmons’ small lunettes, filled with\r\nexquisite little figures, are but a few of the many interesting works\r\nin color. Two of the main entrance doors of bronze were modeled by Olin\r\nL. Warner, but he did not live to complete them. The marble stairway is\r\nby Martini, and the statues which adorn the main reading-room are by\r\nAdams, Bartlett, Partridge, Ward, and others.\r\n\r\nThe plan of the building is that of a central octagon containing the\r\ngeneral reading-room, connected by wings containing the book-stacks\r\nwith a surrounding hollow square containing rooms for special\r\ncollections. There are ample reading-rooms for representatives,\r\nsenators, and the public, and a tunnel by which books are sent to\r\nthe Capitol. This is the last building of considerable importance\r\nconstructed by the government, and it was built on time and within\r\nthe appropriation of $6,000,000; it may be said to be dignified and\r\nsuitable to its purpose, and to be representative of the people at the\r\nclose of the century.\r\n\r\nIt now seems probable that New York will build the handsome library\r\ndesigned by Carrère & Hastings; the Egyptian lines of the reservoir\r\noccupying the site—emphasized by the varying hues of the ivy for so\r\nmany seasons—will give place to those of an example of modern French\r\nRenaissance.\r\n\r\nAmong the changes incidental to the growth of this city is the recent\r\ndisappearance of the old Tombs prison, which was another building\r\nof Egyptian architecture, good of its kind, and quite dignified and\r\nimpressive.\r\n\r\nThere are certain other buildings designed in the style of a country\r\nalmost as tropical as Egypt, and as light and airy as that is sombre\r\nand gloomy, but which seem quite as appropriate for their different\r\npurposes: they are the Casino Theatre and the Synagogue at Fifth\r\nAvenue and Forty-third Street,—each an excellent example of Saracenic\r\narchitecture,—the former of brick and terra cotta, and the latter\r\nof vari-colored sandstones. Another synagogue, by Brunner & Tryon,\r\nfurther up the avenue and facing Central Park, has a decided Byzantine\r\nflavor,—the large arch accentuating the entrance, carrying a small\r\narcade, and being surmounted by the traceried dome.\r\n\r\nThe largest and most expensively elaborate hotel in America is the\r\nWaldorf-Astoria; and although certain features of the exterior may not\r\nbe justified by interior arrangements, it has certainly been planned\r\nwith a view to great comfort and luxury.\r\n\r\nWhile New York has the largest and most expensive private residences,—\r\nthe chief of these is that of Cornelius Vanderbilt,—Philadelphia\r\nhas the greatest number of small houses owned by their occupants;\r\nand of late years, there are a greater number of attractive homes in\r\nSt. Louis than anywhere else in this country. Very many of them have\r\nbeen designed by Eames & Young, or by Shepley, Rutan & Coolidge; and\r\nwith much open space about them, they have an air of elegance and\r\nhospitality that is lacking to the homes in most other cities.\r\n\r\nNew York, from its position as the commercial and financial centre of\r\nthe country, in spite of its situation on a long, narrow island, may\r\nbe accepted as the typical city. What is done here architecturally\r\nis done (only to a different degree) elsewhere, and its growth\r\nhorizontally in the northern portion of the city has kept pace with\r\nits perpendicular growth in the more congested business portion. This\r\ngeneral expansion has altogether changed the character of many streets,\r\nthe residences becoming apartment houses, and the shops becoming office\r\nbuildings from ten to twenty stories,—or even more,—the masses\r\nbecoming larger and the detail proportionately less prominent.\r\n\r\nThe sky-line has entirely changed; the spire of Trinity is lost in\r\nsuch surroundings as the Bowling Green, Empire, Washington Life, and\r\nAmerican Surety buildings, and in the vicinity where the Tribune tower\r\nwas once conspicuous, now the St. Paul Building rises twenty-five\r\nstories, and the Ives Syndicate Building even higher; further and\r\nfurther up Broadway, and to the right and left of it, these monster\r\nbuildings continue to rise. But among them all there is not one\r\nwhich shows a more masterly handling of the problem than the Surety,\r\nwhere the architect, Bruce Price, has emphasized the entrance with\r\na colonnade and six figures of much dignity and grace, and has\r\nconcentrated the ornament about the upper part of the building,\r\ncrowning it with a fine cornice, which is more effective from the\r\nsimplicity of the four walls beneath. This building holds its own among\r\nsuch others as the Washington Life and St. James buildings, New York,\r\nor the Ames Building, Boston, Harrison Building, Philadelphia, Schiller\r\nTheatre, Chicago, Wainwright Building, St. Louis, or Examiner Building,\r\nSan Francisco.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, in so brief a survey of the field, to enumerate more\r\nthan a very small fraction of the buildings illustrating the progress\r\nof the architecture of the century; and aside from the residences,\r\napartments, and hotels where we live winter or summer, and commercial\r\nbuildings in which our working hours may be occupied, there are very\r\nmany examples of churches, schools, colleges, libraries, and museums,\r\ndonated, equipped, and endowed for our instruction, theatres and music\r\nhalls for our entertainment, railroad stations for transportation,\r\nstorage warehouses for the safety of valuables, and armories for the\r\nuse of our militia.\r\n\r\nBesides these, there are engineering works of considerable importance,\r\nsuch as the Eads Bridge, at St. Louis, or the Roebling Bridge, between\r\nNew York and Brooklyn, and the works of the sculptor St. Gaudens, the\r\nWashington Arch by Stanford White, the Farragut and Lincoln statues\r\nin New York and in Chicago, which should surely be mentioned, since\r\nmonumental works are the poetry, whereas the secular and commercial\r\nworks are but the prose of architecture.\r\n\r\nAs we review our productions, we should certainly feel encouraged to\r\nbelieve that if we continue to meet and solve each problem in the same\r\ndirect, honest way that we have been doing for the last quarter of the\r\ncentury, there need be no misgivings as to the future of architecture\r\nin these United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CENTURY’S PROGRESS IN CHEMISTRY\r\n\r\nBY HARVEY W. WILEY, M.D., PH.D., LL.D.,\r\n\r\n_Chief Chemist Agricultural Department, Washington, D. C._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe science of chemistry, as it is known to-day, had its real origin\r\ntowards the end of the eighteenth century. Before and up to that\r\ntime it is true there were many great workers in chemistry, whose\r\nnames are associated with investigations in chemical science, such as\r\nBoyle, Stahl, Black, and Scheele. Contemporary with the close of the\r\neighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth must also be\r\nmentioned particularly the names of Priestly (1733–1804), Cavendish\r\nand Humphry Davy (1778–1829). All these workers had to contend, first\r\nof all, with erroneous theories, which made it difficult to rightly\r\ninterpret the data of experiment. The old theory of phlogiston produced\r\nan environment in which it was difficult for true scientific methods to\r\nsurvive. The great investigator, who did more than any other one man to\r\noverturn this false theory and place chemistry on a firm foundation,\r\nwas Lavoisier (1743–1794). Born near the middle of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, his scientific activity began about 1770, and before he was\r\ntwenty-five he was made a member of the French Academy of Sciences. At\r\nthe age of forty he was recognized as the foremost scientist of his age.\r\n\r\nPriestly discovered oxygen in 1774, but failed to recognize its true\r\nrelations to other bodies. It was Lavoisier who discovered oxidation\r\n(1776), an achievement which meant more to chemistry than the discovery\r\nof oxygen.\r\n\r\nThe observation that metals when heated in confined air increased in\r\nweight while the volume of the confined air decreased, is the crucial\r\nexperiment upon which the whole science of chemistry rests. This\r\nexperiment was made most rigorously by Lavoisier, and the apparatus\r\nwhich he used is still preserved in the Museum of L’École des Arts et\r\nMétiers in Paris. This apparatus, simple in character and yet almost\r\nperfect in construction, has for the chemist a peculiar significance\r\nand sacredness, producing an impression similar to that inspired in the\r\ndevout Christian by the relics of the Cross and the Holy Sepulchre.\r\n\r\nIn the brief space which is assigned for a discussion of the progress\r\nof chemistry during the nineteenth century, economy of words will be\r\nsecured by briefly tracing some of the salient points in the progress\r\nof some of the more important branches of chemical science. In the\r\nfollowing pages, therefore, will be found a brief statement of what has\r\nbeen accomplished, of the most important character, in the science of\r\nchemistry, under the following heads:—\r\n\r\nInorganic chemistry; physical chemistry; organic chemistry; analytical\r\nchemistry; synthetical chemistry; metallurgical chemistry; agricultural\r\nchemistry; graphic chemistry; didactic chemistry; chemistry of\r\nfermentation; and lastly electro-chemistry.\r\n\r\nNo attempt will be made in this paper to enter upon the discussion\r\nof the progress which has been made in medical, pharmaceutical, and\r\nphysiological chemistry. The discussion outlined under the above heads\r\ndoes not by any means embrace the whole subject. It will be sufficient\r\nto indicate only the lines of progress along which the greatest\r\nadvances have been made.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. INORGANIC AND PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: H Davy Pres RS.]\r\n\r\nThe three propositions established by Lavoisier, which serve as the\r\nfoundation for inorganic and physical chemistry, are the following:—\r\n\r\n1. Bodies burn only in contact with pure air.\r\n\r\n2. The air is consumed in the combustion, and the increase in weight of\r\nthe burnt body is equal to the decrease in weight of the air.\r\n\r\n3. In combustion the body is generally changed, by its combination with\r\nthe pure air, into an acid, and metals are changed into metal calx.\r\n\r\nThe total number of elementary bodies known at the beginning of the\r\ncentury was probably less than thirty. Many had been recognized as such\r\nsince remote antiquity, but none of the non-metallic elements, except\r\noxygen and sulphur, was known, and even their properties were not\r\nestablished with any degree of precision.\r\n\r\nNot only did Lavoisier establish the fundamental principles of modern\r\nchemistry, but in connection with Fourcroy (1755–1809), Berthollet\r\n(1748–1822), and Guyton de Morveau (1737–1816), laid the foundation of\r\nmodern chemical nomenclature.\r\n\r\nThe contributions to chemical knowledge at this time were greatly\r\nincreased by the works of the Swedish chemist, Scheele (1742–1786),\r\nand in the beginning years of the century the great work which was\r\naccomplished by Sir Humphry Davy advanced very rapidly the general\r\nknowledge of chemical science.\r\n\r\nDavy’s first works served to elucidate the connection between\r\nelectricity and chemical processes, and it was through the classical\r\nexperiment with an electric current that he isolated (1807) the metals\r\nsodium and potassium, and described their properties.\r\n\r\nThis achievement of Sir Humphry Davy’s was the second great step in the\r\nprogress of chemistry, after the one taken by Lavoisier. By means of\r\nthe metals sodium and potassium other metallic elements were separated,\r\nnotably aluminium by Wöhler (1845). Basing his work upon the above\r\nexperiment, Sainte Claire Deville developed the metallurgy of aluminium\r\n(1854), and Bussy isolated magnesium (1830).\r\n\r\nIn 1811 iodine was discovered by Courtois, and its properties examined\r\nsimultaneously (1814) by Davy and Gay-Lussac.\r\n\r\nThe contributions made by Berzelius (1779–1848), who was a contemporary\r\nof Davy and Gay-Lussac (1778–1850), were of the most important\r\ncharacter. Berzelius not only added to the knowledge of inorganic\r\nchemistry but also established many of the important theories on which\r\nchemical action depends. His elaboration of the employment of the\r\nblowpipe in chemical analysis was of the greatest practical value.\r\n\r\nIn 1807 Dalton published a work entitled “New System of Chemical\r\nPhilosophy,” in which was announced for the first time the law of the\r\ndefinite proportions of bodies forming a definite union. The atomic\r\ntheory of matter was also developed by Dalton, who gave it a definite\r\nform and expression. Chemists now began to consider the elements as\r\ndefinite indestructible particles of matter, forming unions among\r\nthemselves and with different kinds of atoms to form molecules, which\r\nwere considered as the units of substances. As a result of this\r\nsupposition, the development of the principle of the relative weight\r\nwith which bodies combine was the logical consequence.\r\n\r\nNow for the first time the elements began to assume not only names\r\nand descriptions of properties but also numbers, showing the relative\r\nweight of their atoms or final conditions of existence. It was only\r\nnecessary, therefore, to assume the standard of comparison for any\r\none element, in order to determine the relative weights with which it\r\ncombined with others. Thus the system of atomic weights was developed.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the law of chemical action, that most elementary bodies\r\nexist in a condition where two atoms are joined together to form a\r\nmolecule, it follows, that in most instances the molecular weights of\r\nthe elements are double their atomic weight. There are, however, many\r\nnotable exceptions to this rule.\r\n\r\nThe supposition of the existence of atoms was followed soon by another\r\ntheoretical proposition, advanced by Prout (1815). Assuming that the\r\natomic weight of hydrogen was one, Prout’s hypothesis asserted that the\r\natomic weights of all other elementary bodies were multiples of that\r\nof hydrogen. The most rigid investigations of recent years have shown\r\nthat Prout’s hypothesis is untenable; but the remarkable fact still\r\nremains, that in a great many cases the atomic weights of the elements\r\nare almost whole numbers, or differ from whole numbers by almost a half\r\nunit.\r\n\r\nThe determination of the atomic weights of the various elements\r\nduring the past one hundred years has been worked on by hundreds of\r\nchemists whose names it would be impracticable to mention. The most\r\nimportant of them are Berzelius, Cooke, Cleve, Delafontaine, Dumas,\r\nHermann, Marchand, Marignac (1817), Morley, Noyes, Pelouse (1807–1867),\r\nRichards, Schneider, Stas (1813–1891), and Thompson. Of all these\r\nworkers Stas, a Belgian chemist, is perhaps the most renowned. Among\r\nthose mentioned, Cooke, Morley, Noyes, Delafontaine, and Richards are\r\ncitizens of the United States.\r\n\r\nFrom the less than thirty elements which were known at the beginning\r\nof the century, there are known to-day seventy-two with certainty,\r\nand perhaps one or two more whose identity has not yet been fully\r\nestablished. The chemists who have become most renowned by the\r\ndiscovery of elementary bodies are: Cavendish, Scheele, Berzelius,\r\nWöhler (1800–1882), Davy, Gay-Lussac, Priestly, Bunsen (b. 1811),\r\nCrookes (b. 1832), and Ramsay.\r\n\r\nThe following elements, twenty-eight in number, were known before 1800:\r\n\r\nELEMENTS KNOWN BEFORE 1800.\r\n\r\n   1.

Numbers 49, 50, and\r\n51 are not yet sufficiently well known to justify being considered\r\nelements, and are therefore properly followed by an interrogation point.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY.\r\n\r\nIn strictly physical chemistry the relations of electricity and heat\r\nto chemical action have been extensively developed during the century.\r\nThe specific heats of the elements and of most of their compounds have\r\nbeen carefully determined, and thermo and physical chemistry under the\r\nleadership of such master minds as Berthollet, Thompson, Van’t Hoff,\r\nand Ostwald have been brought to the highest degree of perfection.\r\n\r\nThe chemist now does not consider that he knows any body until he knows\r\nthoroughly its relations to heat and to electricity. The action of\r\nlight must also be included, but this subject will be more thoroughly\r\ndiscussed under graphic chemistry.\r\n\r\nThe nature of solutions has also been developed by the studies of\r\nOstwald and Van’t Hoff, and as a result of these studies, a flood of\r\nlight has been thrown upon the constitution of compound bodies.\r\n\r\nIn the development of physical chemistry, attention should be directed\r\nto the help afforded by Newlands (1864) and Mendelejeff (1869) and\r\nothers, showing that the elements form groups which tend to recur with\r\na periodicity which is sufficiently definite to enable the investigator\r\nto foretell to some extent the properties of the elements which have\r\nnever yet been discovered, and whose existence is necessary in order to\r\nfill up the gaps in existing groups.\r\n\r\nBy this method the existence, atomic weight and properties of scandium,\r\ngallium, and germanium were foretold years before their discovery.\r\nSuch actual realization of a scientific-prophetic method is one of\r\nthe strongest indications of the basis of fact upon which it rests.\r\nAlthough a rigid application of the principles of the periodic law is\r\nnot possible, yet its discovery and elaboration mark one of the great\r\nforward steps of chemical philosophy.\r\n\r\nIf we regard any material system by itself, i.e., independently of any\r\nother system or influence by which it may be surrounded, we recognize\r\nit as consisting of essentially two things,—matter and energy. A\r\nprecise definition of either matter or energy is difficult, if not\r\nimpossible; but what is connoted by these names is sufficiently well\r\nunderstood by their well-known properties. Both energy and matter are\r\nessential to each and every system. They are coexistent. In the light\r\nof human experience, we cannot conceive of one existing without the\r\nother; and in the study of any material system, consideration of one of\r\nthese components without the other can only be regarded as incomplete.\r\nBut, for the sake of convenience, this has been the practice, and,\r\ngenerally speaking, chemists have concerned themselves with matter\r\nchanges of equilibria, while physicists have more especially directed\r\ntheir attention to energy equilibria. The object of the physical\r\nchemist is to follow equilibria changes in given systems, having due\r\nregard for both the matter and energy involved.\r\n\r\nBerthollet may be regarded as the first true physical chemist, on\r\naccount of his classical views on mass action. Largely because the time\r\nwas not ripe for it, his views were not generally adopted.\r\n\r\nA quarter of a century later (1867), Guldberg and Waage gave a precise\r\nmathematical expression of the law, but still it attracted very little\r\nattention from investigators. A tremendous impetus was given to the\r\nsubject by the electrolytic dissociation theory of Arrhenius (1887),\r\nand the extension of the additive laws of gases to dilute solutions,\r\nby Van’t Hoff (1885). This was but a comparatively small field in\r\nthe subject, but it stimulated activity along the whole line, the\r\nwonderful increase of our knowledge concerning the velocity or rates of\r\nreaction, the heat changes involved, and the marvelous development of\r\nelectrolytic chemistry being pertinent instances.\r\n\r\nThe generalization of Gibbs, known as the phase rule (1876), which\r\naccurately states the condition for equilibrium in the system, and\r\nthe Theorem of Le Chatelier (1884), that any change in the factors\r\nof equilibrium from outside is followed by a reverse change within\r\nthe system, together with the mass law, now give us a consistent\r\ntheoretical foundation for the subject. In general terms, it may be\r\nsaid that all chemistry, at least all theoretical chemistry, properly\r\nbelongs to the province of physical chemistry, and the title, while in\r\nmany ways convenient, is misleading.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. ORGANIC CHEMISTRY.\r\n\r\nCompounds containing carbon enter into all the products of a living\r\ncell. For this reason the chemistry of carbon compounds came to be\r\nknown as organic chemistry. This should not be taken as a definition,\r\nhowever, without limitations. Many of the compounds containing carbon\r\nare not known to enter into living tissue in any way, and their\r\nconnection with it is very remote and not essential. On the other\r\nhand, it should be remembered that many organic compounds, and those\r\neven of most importance, contain some other element,—nitrogen, for\r\nexample,—as the significant one.\r\n\r\nWhile nearly all the known elements can enter into organic compounds,\r\nthe vast majority of such substances are composed of but very few. For\r\ninstance, those classes of which sugar, starch, the fats, etc., are\r\nexamples, contain only carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen. With nitrogen,\r\nsulphur, and phosphorus added to these elements, almost the entire\r\nrange of organic chemistry is covered. Organic chemistry, therefore,\r\ndiffers from inorganic chemistry in that, while the number of compounds\r\nis much larger, the number of elements involved is very limited.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MICHAEL FARADAY.]\r\n\r\nBerzelius may be regarded as having founded organic chemistry in the\r\nbeginning of this century. As a result of his analyses of the salts\r\nof organic acids, he clearly demonstrated that the laws of definite\r\nand multiple proportions hold equally for organic compounds and for\r\ninorganic ones. The work of this master was ably furthered by Liebig\r\n(1803–1873), who devised most elegant methods for the analytical\r\ninvestigation of organic compounds, methods which are in use to-day\r\nwithout any essential change.\r\n\r\nVery soon, however, it was found that organic compounds existed having\r\nthe same percentage composition, but quite dissimilar properties,\r\nphysical and chemical, as, for instance, sugar and starch. Other\r\nstriking examples are Faraday’s discovery (1825) of a compound\r\nidentical in composition with ethylene, but wholly different in\r\nproperties; and Wöhler’s classical synthesis (1828) of urea by the\r\ntransformation of ammonium cyanate. Similar facts in the domain of\r\ninorganic chemistry, though now well known, were at that time wanting,\r\nand thus this most fruitful idea, designated as isomerism, was\r\nintroduced into the science.\r\n\r\nThe next great step was the introduction of the theory of radicles,\r\nfirst suggested tentatively by Berzelius (1810), but put forward in\r\na definite way as one of the results of the classical investigation\r\non benzoyl by Liebig and Wöhler (1832). That is to say, a group of\r\nelements, or radicle, can pass through a series of compounds, from one\r\nto the other, as though the group were one single element. For years\r\nthis idea was the guiding principle in chemical investigations, and\r\nwas most useful in aiding the classification of chemical compounds and\r\nbringing order out of the chaos of accumulating observations.\r\n\r\nBut the search for radicles was in a sense a vain one. We now know\r\nthat _no_ radicle exists as such by itself. Meanwhile, Dumas and\r\nhis pupil Laurent had introduced and developed the theory of types,\r\nwhereby all chemical compounds could be classified under four types,\r\nwhich marked a distinct step in advance. Laurent, together with his\r\ncolleague Gerhardt (1816–1856), recognized the shortcomings of both\r\nthe radicle and type theories in their earlier forms, and showed\r\ntheir inter-relation, when modified so as to do away with certain\r\ninconsistencies.\r\n\r\nDumas had before this demonstrated the theory of substitution\r\n(1834),—that is, that in certain compounds one or more of the elements\r\ncan be driven out and replaced by others without changing the essential\r\ncharacteristics of the compound. For instance, chloracetic acid,\r\nin which part of the hydrogen of acetic acid has been replaced by\r\nchlorine, contains all the essential characteristics of acetic acid; in\r\nfact, some of them—its acidic properties, for example—being markedly\r\naccentuated. This theory was fiercely assailed at first, notably by\r\nLiebig. Like all theories of science, it was in the beginning pushed\r\nto the extreme, and put forward to explain things to which it was\r\nnot applicable. It gradually came to demonstrate its own right to\r\nexistence, largely as a result of the work of Laurent and Gerhardt,\r\nand made its influence felt in the exposition of their ideas, to which\r\nreference has just been made.\r\n\r\nThe development of these theories, about the middle of the century, was\r\ngreatly hastened by the work of many brilliant investigators, notably\r\nWurtz (1817–1884), Hofmann (1818–1892), Williamson (1824–), Kolbe\r\n(1818–1884), and Frankland (1825–) among others.\r\n\r\nKekulé proposed a new type, marsh gas or methane. Shortly afterwards,\r\nhis well-known formula for benzene, the starting-point and foundation\r\nof the vast class of aromatic bodies, was proposed. He insisted that\r\nthe time had come when chemists must ask what those ultimate particles,\r\nor atoms, of the elements themselves were doing in these compounds\r\nof various types. The answer was a grand one, and the result, our\r\nmagnificent store of information concerning the _constitution_ of\r\norganic compounds, or the way in which the atoms are connected with\r\neach other. It is not to be inferred that our knowledge on this\r\nsubject, in any one case, is complete. Far from it! Much that is most\r\ninteresting and important is apparently as remote from our grasp as\r\never. But we do know something about the general relations of the atoms\r\nin the molecule, and our knowledge, so far as it goes, is definite and\r\nprecise.\r\n\r\nSomewhat later, Van’t Hoff and Lebel, at the same time but\r\nindependently, introduced the study of the space relations of organic\r\ncompounds by suggesting the simplest possible space formula (the\r\ntetrahedron) for marsh gas or methane, of which all other organic\r\ncompounds may, theoretically at least, be regarded as derivatives.\r\nMany inexplicable relations, especially among isomers, now became\r\nclear. The theory was at first bitterly assailed, especially by Kolbe.\r\nIt found an able champion in Wislicenus (1838–), however, and has so\r\nthoroughly established itself, that it may be safely said that at the\r\npresent day it is the controlling idea in the large majority of organic\r\ninvestigations.\r\n\r\nThe carbon atom is characterized by a wonderful facility in uniting\r\nnot only with other elements, but with itself. It would even appear as\r\nthough its influence in this regard extended to other elements united\r\nwith it, as nitrogen, for instance, shows an unexpected ability to\r\nunite with nitrogen in organic compounds.\r\n\r\nFurther, the carbon atom is characterized by an unusually constant\r\nvalency, namely, four. These two characteristics account for homology,\r\nthat is, for a series of similar compounds differing in composition\r\none from the other by—CH2, and enables us to trace back all organic\r\ncompounds to one mother substance—marsh gas or methane.\r\n\r\nThese ideas have also been more or less successfully applied to the\r\nstudy of the composition of inorganic compounds. The assistance organic\r\nchemistry has given to the general subject is incalculable. Finally,\r\nit may be said, that while in the nature of the case our ideas of\r\nstructure in organic compounds cannot be regarded as proved, or as\r\nnot subject to possible future modifications, we have, at least, a\r\nconsistent theory and good working hypothesis. A homely illustration of\r\nour present ideas may be drawn from the modern high city building. The\r\nskeleton of this building is made of iron, about which are grouped the\r\nbrick, stone, wood, and other materials to form a complete building.\r\nSo the organic body is built on a chain or frame-work or skeleton of\r\ncarbon atoms, about which are grouped the atoms of hydrogen, oxygen,\r\nand nitrogen, or radicle compounds thereof.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible here to even name some of the more eminent workers\r\nwho for a quarter of a century have contributed to our knowledge of\r\norganic chemistry. This branch of chemistry has been the vogue, and has\r\nbeen pushed almost to the limit of possibility since 1875. Many almost\r\nunexplored fields still remain, but chemists recognize the fact that\r\nin theory and practice organic chemistry has reached a high degree of\r\nperfection, and they are returning to continue the researches in other\r\nfields which have for so long been almost neglected.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY.\r\n\r\nNo branch of chemical science has a more general interest for the\r\npublic than that which relates to the determination of the materials of\r\nwhich bodies are composed, and the proportions in which they exist.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the century considerable progress had been made\r\nin this branch of knowledge by the researches of Boyle (1626–1691),\r\nHoffmann, Margraff (1709–1780), Scheele and Bergmann (1735–1784).\r\nBerzelius, as has already been mentioned, had added a new and valuable\r\nfactor to chemical analysis by the development of the blowpipe, and\r\nin the early part of the century mineral analysis was still further\r\nadvanced by Klaproth (1743–1817), Rose (1798–1873), and many others.\r\n\r\nNo one man did so much to advance this branch of chemical science as\r\nFresenius (1818–1897). He collated and proved all the proposed methods\r\nof analysis, both qualitative and quantitative, and out of a confused\r\nmass of material formed a logical system of procedure, which has proved\r\ninvaluable to the progress of chemical science in all its branches.\r\n\r\nThe volumetric methods of analysis, which save so much time and labor\r\nwithout sacrificing accuracy, were developed by Gay-Lussac, Vauquelin\r\n(1763–1879), Mohr (1806–1879), Volhard, Sutton, Fehling, and Liebig.\r\n\r\nThe methods of gas analysis have been worked out chiefly by Bunsen,\r\nably assisted by Winkler and Hempel.\r\n\r\nThe methods of determining the elementary bodies in organic compounds\r\nhave been developed by Dumas, Liebig, Will, Varrentrap, and Kjeldahl,\r\nto the last of whom chemical analysis owes a debt of gratitude for the\r\ninvention of a speedy and accurate method of determining nitrogen.\r\n\r\nNot much less is the debt due to Gooch for the invention of the\r\nperforated platinum crucible, carrying an asbestos felt for securing\r\nprecipitates by filtration, in a form suitable to ignition without\r\nfurther preparation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM CROOKES, F. R. S.]\r\n\r\nThrough the classic researches of Arago (1786–1853) and Biot\r\n(1774–1862), polarized light has been made a most valuable adjunct\r\nto chemical research, serving as it does to measure the quantity of\r\nvarious alkaloids, essential oils, and sugars.\r\n\r\nBased on these researches of Biot and Arago, Ventzke, Soleil,\r\nScheibler, Duboscq, Landolt, and Lippich have constructed apparatus,\r\nwhich have made an exact science of optical saccharimetry. Optical\r\nanalysis is not without its relation to theoretical chemistry, for by\r\nit has been proved the assumption that optically active bodies contain\r\nan asymmetrical carbon atom,—that is, one which combines with four\r\ndifferent atoms or radicles.\r\n\r\nElectricity has become also one of the most useful factors in chemical\r\nanalysis. Many metals are easily deposited by electrolytic action, and\r\ntheir separation and determination rendered easy and certain.\r\n\r\nChemical analysis has not only given us accurate knowledge of the\r\nconstituents of matter, but by revealing the deportment of molecules\r\nand groups of molecules in inorganic and organic compounds, has opened\r\nup a path for organic and synthetic chemistry which otherwise must have\r\nremained forever closed.\r\n\r\nThe discovery and development of spectrum analysis is one of the great\r\nachievements of the nineteenth century in chemical science.\r\n\r\nWollaston, in 1802, first noticed that the spectrum of the sun’s\r\nlight, when greatly magnified, was not composed of colors gradually\r\nchanging from one to the other, but that the continuity of the colors\r\nwas interrupted by dark bands. Fraunhofer, in 1814, had made a map\r\nof the solar spectrum, showing 576 of these dark lines. Fraunhofer\r\nwas entirely ignorant of the cause of these dark lines, but when he\r\nhad found them, not only in the light from the sun, but also from the\r\nmoon and the fixed stars, he properly concluded that they were due to\r\nsomething entirely independent of the earth.\r\n\r\nIt remained for Bunsen and Kirchhoff, in 1860, to point out the\r\nfact that these dark lines were characteristic of certain chemical\r\nelements existing in the sun and its photosphere, and this fact is the\r\nfoundation of spectrum analysis. The broad black band in the sun’s\r\nspectrum, called by Fraunhofer D, corresponded exactly in position\r\nand in width with the yellow band produced by a flame containing\r\nincandescent sodium. There was no doubt whatever, therefore, that\r\nthe two phenomena were due to the same cause; but why in the one case\r\nshould the band be black and in the other yellow? This question was\r\nanswered by the discovery of the fact that a ray of light colored by\r\nincandescent sodium, passing through a luminous atmosphere of the same\r\nmetal, would lose by absorption all of its yellow color, and would\r\ndisplay a black band where before the yellow color existed.\r\n\r\nBased upon this observation, the development of spectrum analysis went\r\nforward with amazing rapidity. The hundreds of lines in the sun’s\r\nspectrum were found to occupy exactly the position of luminous lines\r\nin the spectra of various metals, and thus it was possible for the\r\nchemist to extend his investigations beyond the limits of the earth,\r\nand distinguish the chemical elements in the sun and in the fixed stars\r\nbillions of miles farther away from us than the sun itself. Celestial\r\nchemistry has thus become a fixed and definite science.\r\n\r\nBut the value of spectral examinations has extended still farther. Many\r\nluminous lines were observed in the spectrum which were not found in\r\nthe spectra of any known element. The inference then logically arose\r\nthat there were elements yet undiscovered to which these lines were\r\ndue. From this starting point investigations proceeded which have led\r\nto the discovery of a large number of elementary bodies. Among the\r\nimportant elements that have been discovered by means of spectrum\r\nanalysis may be mentioned: cæsium, rubidium, thallium, indium, gallium,\r\nytterbium, and scandium.\r\n\r\nSpectrum analysis is also extremely useful in proving the verity of\r\nsupposed new elements; for if a supposed new element should be found to\r\ngive a series of spectral lines coincident with those already known, it\r\nwould be a positive proof of the fact that the supposed new element was\r\nbut a mixture of bodies already known to exist.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. SYNTHETICAL CHEMISTRY.\r\n\r\nThis branch of chemical science has for its object the building up of\r\nthe more complex from the simpler forms of matter. In the early part\r\nof the century, Chevreul and Wöhler laid the foundation of the science\r\nby the synthesis of fatty-like bodies and urea. Berthellot and Friedel\r\n(1832–) in France, and Williamson and Frankland in England, added much\r\nto our knowledge. Kolbe, in Germany, made salicylic acid so abundantly\r\nas to banish the natural article from the market. The synthesis of\r\ncoloring matters resembling indigo was also a great blow to that\r\nindustry. From the products of the distillation of coal, chemists were\r\nable to make thousands of valuable bodies of the greatest utility. Many\r\nmedicinal substances and nearly all the common dyes trace their origin\r\nto coal.\r\n\r\nFischer (b. 1852), in Germany, has contributed his remarkable\r\nresults in the synthesis of sugar to the last years of the century.\r\nLillienfeld, in Austria, has gone still further, and has built up a\r\nbody which has many of the properties of protein, one of the most\r\nhighly organized of organic substances.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR HENRY BESSEMER.]\r\n\r\nIn the inorganic world synthesis is not so difficult a matter as the\r\nvast number of compounds attest. By means of the electric furnace,\r\nMoissan, in France, has succeeded in uniting carbon with many of the\r\nmetallic elements, and thus opened the path for new achievements in\r\npassing directly from inorganic to organic compounds.\r\n\r\nThe progress of chemical synthesis has already blotted out the old\r\ndistinction between inorganic and organic chemistry, and we can no\r\nlonger say of organic bodies that they are the products of living\r\ncells. Organic bodies are those which contain a carbon or other\r\nelementary skeleton, to which are attached the elements or groups of\r\nelements forming the complete body.\r\n\r\nThe claim which has been made that synthetical chemistry would in the\r\nnear future produce the food of man, and thus relegate agriculture\r\nto the domain of the useless or forgotten arts, is, however, wholly\r\nwithout scientific foundation. The function of the farmer will not\r\nbe usurped by the chemist. The future will see the most important\r\ncontributions to chemistry coming from the field of organic chemistry,\r\nbut it will also see the farmer following in the furrow, and man\r\ndepending for his food on the fields of waving grain.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. METALLURGICAL CHEMISTRY.\r\n\r\nThis is the oldest branch of chemical science, and naturally the\r\none which was furthest advanced at the beginning of the century.\r\nNevertheless, the advances which the past one hundred years have seen\r\nin this science are most surprising. Gold and silver are now secured\r\nfrom ores so poor as to have rendered them of no value a hundred years\r\nago. The Bessemer process of steel making (1856) has revolutionized the\r\nworld, and made possible railroads and steamships. The basic Bessemer\r\nprocess of making steel from pig-iron rich in phosphorus, has opened up\r\nrich mines of iron ore hitherto valueless. The basic phosphatic slag,\r\nresulting from this process, is of the highest value in the fields,\r\nand has brought agriculture and metallurgy into intimate relationship.\r\nThe electric furnace has made aluminium almost as cheap as iron, bulk\r\nfor bulk, and electric welding bids fair to take the place of the old\r\nprocess, with the cheapening of metals.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY.\r\n\r\nSir Humphry Davy, in the beginning of the century, delivered a course\r\nof lectures on the relations of chemistry to agriculture, and these\r\nwere published in book form. In France, important contributions\r\nwere made to agricultural chemical science by Vauquelin, Chevreul\r\n(1786–1889), and Boussingault (1802–1887), who made important\r\nresearches before the middle of the century. The most important work in\r\nagricultural chemistry, however, was done by Liebig. His achievements\r\nso overshadowed those of his predecessors that he is generally\r\nregarded, although improperly, as the father of that branch of the\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nThe early achievements of these workers showed the relatively small\r\nportions of the crops that were derived from the soil. The study\r\nof the ash constituents of plants laid the foundation of rational\r\nfertilizing, and the utilization of the stores of plant food preserved\r\nin great natural deposits.\r\n\r\nBeginning with the middle of the century, the attention of agronomists\r\nwas called to the desirability of utilizing the deposits of guano,\r\nfound in the islands along the west coast of South America; of the\r\ndeposits of phosphate rock existing in many localities; and later, of\r\nthe potash salts, discovered near Stassfurt, which completed the trio\r\nof available natural foods most useful to plants.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of an agricultural experiment station by Sir John\r\nLawes at Rothamstead (1834), before the middle of the century, set an\r\nexample which has been followed by the establishment of experiment\r\nstations in all the civilized countries of the world.\r\n\r\nUnder the great stimulus given to agricultural research by these\r\nstations, progress during the latter half of the century has been very\r\nrapid. There now exist in Europe nearly one hundred stations devoted to\r\nagricultural research, and in this country the number is half as great.\r\n\r\nConspicuous achievements, marking the closing years of the century,\r\nhave been the discovery of the methods whereby organic nitrogen is\r\nrendered suitable for plant food, and atmospheric nitrogen fixed and\r\nrendered available by leguminous plants. In the first instance, it has\r\nbeen established that organic nitrogen in the soil can only be utilized\r\nby plants after it has been oxidized by bacterial action. In the case\r\nof leguminous plants, nitrogen is rendered available for nutrition by\r\nmeans of bacteria inhabiting nodules in the roots of the legumes. These\r\ntwo great discoveries have proved of incalculable benefit to practical\r\nagriculture. Chemical science in its relations to agriculture has shown\r\nthat the fertility of the soil may be conserved and increased, while\r\nthe magnitude of the crops harvested is sustained or augmented. Thus,\r\nno matter how rapid may be the increase of population, agricultural\r\nchemistry will provide abundant food.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. GRAPHIC CHEMISTRY.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOUIS JACQUES DAGUERRE.]\r\n\r\nThe honor of discovering that prints could be made by the action of\r\nlight on certain salts, such as those of silver, belongs to Daguerre,\r\nin 1839.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental principle of graphic chemistry is that metallic salts,\r\nsensitive to the light, when in contact with organic matter, suffer\r\na complete or partial reduction and are rendered insoluble. The\r\nintensity of the reduction is measured exactly by the intensity of the\r\nlight. When light is reflected from any object capable of producing\r\ndifferent degrees of intensity, as from the hair and face of a man,\r\nthe reduction of the metal is greatest by the light from that portion\r\nof the physiognomy which gives the greatest reflection. Thus, when\r\nthe unreduced metallic salt is washed out, a permanent record, the\r\nnegative, of the object is left.\r\n\r\nIt is a long step from the first daguerreotype to the modern\r\nphotograph, but the principle of the process has remained unchanged.\r\n\r\nPhotographs in natural colors have of late years been obtained.\r\nOne method is by interposing a film of metallic mercury behind the\r\nsensitive plate which must be transparent. The reflected rays of light,\r\nhaving different wave lengths, precipitate the metal in superimposed\r\nfilms, corresponding to the wave or half-wave length. When a negative\r\nthus formed is seen by reflected light, the emergent rays from the\r\nsuperimposed films acting as mirrors are transformed into the original\r\ncolors of the photographed object.\r\n\r\nThe various methods of printing by heliotypes, photolithographs,\r\nphotogravures, etc., are illustrations of the application of graphic\r\nchemistry to the arts.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. DIDACTIC CHEMISTRY.\r\n\r\nThe lectures of Davy and Faraday in England, of Wöhler and Liebig in\r\nGermany, of Chevreul and Dumas in France, and of Silliman (1779–1864)\r\nin this country, made the study of chemistry attractive and easy during\r\nthe early part of the century.\r\n\r\nIt was noticed, however, that the students who finished these courses,\r\nwhile well versed in the principles of the science, were not able to\r\napply them in practice. Towards the middle of the century, therefore,\r\na radical change in the system of instruction was inaugurated. The\r\nstudent was put to work and taught to question nature for himself. The\r\nuniversities of France and Germany were equipped with working desks\r\nwhere students of chemistry put into practice at once the principles\r\nof the science which they heard elucidated in the lecture room. Cooke,\r\nat Harvard, was the chief apostle of the laboratory method in this\r\ncountry, and this method of instruction has now spread, until even the\r\nhigh and grammar schools have their chemical laboratories.\r\n\r\nIn our universities, students may now begin their chemical studies\r\nassociated with laboratory practice in the first year of their course,\r\nand continue it to the end. Graduates of such courses are not only\r\ngrounded in the theories of chemistry, but are thoroughly familiar with\r\nits practice. Under this system, coupled with the demand for chemical\r\nservices in every branch of industry, the number of trained chemists\r\nhas speedily increased. At this time (1899) there are more than four\r\nthousand trained chemists in the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nX. CHEMISTRY OF FERMENTATION.\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of fermentation and bacterial action is practically all\r\ncomprised in the achievements of the nineteenth century. Prior to this\r\ntime it was known that fermentation took place, but its causes and\r\ncharacter were wholly mysterious. The great work of Pasteur (1859)\r\nresulted in the fact that fermentations were chiefly caused by the\r\nactivity of living cells, which have the capacity of reproduction. The\r\nmost common form of fermentation is that whereby sugar is converted\r\ninto alcohol and carbon dioxide. The name of the organism that produces\r\nthis change is _saccharomyces cerevisiae_.\r\n\r\nAnother class of fermentation is seen in the process of digestion. This\r\nspecies of fermentation is typified by the action of sprouted barley\r\non starch, whereby the starch is converted into sugar. The active\r\nprinciple of the saliva, ptyalin, has the same property, and when\r\nstarchy bodies are masticated, a part, at least, of the starch which\r\nthey contain is converted into sugar. The active principle of malt is\r\nknown as diastase, and this, as well as ptyalin, belongs to a class of\r\nferments which are incapable of reproduction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOUIS PASTEUR.]\r\n\r\nAll the decompositions of organic matter, such as the decay of meats\r\nand vegetables, are now known to be forms of fermentation, due to the\r\naction of certain organisms known by the group name of bacteria. This\r\ndiscovery led naturally to the process of preserving organic compounds\r\nby sterilization. The principles on which this process depends are\r\nvery simple. If an organic body, such as a fruit or vegetable, be\r\nsubjected for some time to a high temperature,—that of boiling water\r\nwill usually suffice,—the fermentation germs which it contains will be\r\ndestroyed. If then it be sealed in such a way, either hermetically or\r\nwith a plug of sterilized cotton, so that no living germ can reach it,\r\ndecomposition cannot take place. Certain chemicals, such for instance\r\nas salicylic acid and formaldehyde, have the property of paralyzing or\r\nsuspending germ action, and hence organic bodies treated with these\r\nsubstances may also be protected against decomposition.\r\n\r\nThe activity of fermentation is made use of in the technical arts.\r\nBread is made light by fermentation, and wine, beer, and cider are made\r\nby the fermentation of fruits and grains. Alcohol is produced by the\r\nfermentation of grains and potatoes, their starch having previously\r\nbeen converted into sugar by malt.\r\n\r\nBuchner has lately shown that all fermentation is of one kind, namely,\r\nthat due to ferments of the diastase type. The fermentation produced\r\nby yeast, for instance, is not due, according to his observations, to\r\nthe living cells, but to the products of their activity. By destroying\r\nyeast cells, by grinding and high pressure, and using their contents,\r\nhe has secured a vigorous fermentation similar in every respect to that\r\ncaused by the cells themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI. ELECTRO-CHEMISTRY.\r\n\r\nThe electric furnace, which affords a higher heat than chemists had\r\nbeen able to secure, has been the promoter of great advances in\r\ninorganic chemistry. Moissan (b. 1852), a French chemist, has been\r\nthe most successful in applying the heat of the electric furnace to\r\nanalytic and synthetic studies. One of the practical results which\r\nhas come from these studies has been the virtual bridging over of the\r\nchasm which has been supposed to exist between organic and inorganic\r\ncompounds. Under the influence of the heat of the electric furnace,\r\ncarbon, which is the keystone of organic compounds, has been made to\r\ncombine directly with the metals, forming a series of bodies known as\r\nmetallic carbides. The carbide of calcium, under the action of water,\r\nyields a gas known as acetylene, which by a series of reactions can be\r\nconverted into alcohol. Thus alcohol, which only a short time ago was\r\nsupposed to be solely the product of organic life, is shown also to\r\nresult from a simple inorganic reaction such as has been shown above.\r\n\r\nThe importance of electrolysis in metallurgical and analytical\r\nchemistry has already been noticed. So rapid has been the progress\r\nalong these lines that the terms metallurgical chemistry and\r\nelectro-chemistry are in some respects almost synonymous.\r\n\r\nElectricity has also been employed in many of the chemical arts; _e.\r\ng._, in the promotion of crystallization and purification of organic\r\nsolutions as practiced in the sugar industry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRIVING A NAIL WITH A HAMMER MADE OF FROZEN MERCURY.]\r\n\r\nThough belonging rather to analytical than to electro-chemistry, one\r\nmay here mention the wonders of that discovery which belongs to the\r\nclose of the nineteenth century, and which is known as “liquid air.”\r\nUntil 1877 air—oxygen and nitrogen—was regarded as a permanent gas.\r\nOxygen liquefies at 300° below zero and nitrogen at 320°. When air\r\nis cooled to those degrees it assumes a misty form and falls like\r\nraindrops to the bottom of the vessel. It then gives off vapor, like\r\nboiling water. If poured out on a conductor, as iron or ice, it assumes\r\nthe gaseous state so rapidly as to amount to an explosion. The many\r\nexperiments with it are simply wonderful, and the practical claims for\r\nit are without end. Already it runs an engine and motor vehicles. It is\r\nclaimed that it will complete the problem of aerial navigation; that\r\nit is the coming power in gunnery and blasting; that it affords the\r\nideal sanitation; that in surgery it offers the most perfect chemical\r\ncauterization.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nThere is no branch of science that holds such an intimate relation\r\nto the progress and welfare of man as chemistry. First of all, it\r\nis chiefly instrumental in providing him with food and clothing, as\r\nhas been shown in the paragraph on agricultural chemistry. In the\r\nsecond place it has extended his domain over matter and, in connection\r\nwith physics, has established the identity of the composition of the\r\nuniverse with that of the earth. The universe has thus been shown to\r\nbe of a single origin and of uniform properties. By understanding\r\nthe constitution of matter, with which he is surrounded, man is able\r\nto utilize to the best advantage the material at his disposal. Thus\r\ninvention is promoted and the application of chemical knowledge in the\r\narts extended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CENTURY’S MUSIC AND DRAMA\r\n\r\nBY RITER FITZGERALD, A.M.,\r\n\r\n_Dramatic Critic “City Item,” Philadelphia_.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. MUSIC.\r\n\r\nMusic finds its highest artistic development in the happy combinations\r\nwhich go to make up the opera. These combinations passed through\r\nvarious historic stages, and ripened into noble maturity by the end\r\nof the eighteenth century, under the guiding genius of the Handels,\r\nMozarts, and Glucks of the times. Their legacy passed, in the\r\nnineteenth century, to a host of worthy successors, among whom stands,\r\nas a central figure, Verdi, the great Italian operatic composer; while\r\nWagner, of Germany, has striven with herculean might to revolutionize\r\nthe lyrical drama by polemical writing, by twofold authorship of\r\nwords and notes, and by a new application of principles gathered from\r\nantecedent reformers. His efforts produced a commotion in the art\r\nworld which might be compared to that excited by the rivalry between\r\nBuonocini and Handel in London, or Piccini and Gluck in Paris, but for\r\nthe fact that in each of these instances the contention was between\r\none composer and another, whereas in the case of Wagner it was the\r\nopposition of one composer to all others in the world, save the few\r\nwho, believing in the man, his teachings, and his wonderful powers\r\nof application, undertook propagandism as a duty, and endeavored to\r\nmake proselytes to their faith. He did not live to see the day when\r\nhis efforts could be called completely successful, and his death in\r\n1883 left judgment quite wide open as to his theoretical and practical\r\nmerits. The nineteenth century closes with the question still on as\r\nto the permanence or evanescence of his many unique, ponderous, and\r\nrevolutionizing productions.\r\n\r\nVerdi, who still lives, surpasses all the composers of his time in the\r\nbeauty of his melodies and the intensity of his dramatic power.\r\n\r\nRossini, whose “Guillaume Tell,” which was produced in Paris in 1829,\r\nwas his masterpiece, ruled the operatic world before Verdi, until he\r\ndied in Paris in 1868.\r\n\r\nMeyerbeer, whose principal operas are “Les Huguenots,” “Le Prophète,”\r\nand “L’Africaine” (the latter produced in Paris in 1865, the year after\r\nits composer’s death), was regarded as a remarkable composer, whose\r\nknowledge of effect was unsurpassed, and whose fine intelligence and\r\nmusical knowledge almost made the world forgive him for frequent lack\r\nof inspiration.\r\n\r\nHalévy, whose only lasting success was “La Juive,” composed other\r\noperas, such as “Charles VI.,” “La Reine de Chypre,” “L’Eclair,” and\r\n“Les Mousquetaires de la Reine,” that achieved a certain amount of\r\nsuccess in France, which success was interrupted by Halévy’s death at\r\nNice in 1862.\r\n\r\nGounod, in 1859, made his most remarkable success with his greatest\r\nopera, “Faust,” which, after the subject had been treated by Spohr,\r\nLindpainter, Schumann, Berlioz, and other distinguished composers, has\r\nremained the only completely successful opera on the subject, although\r\nBoito’s “Mefistofile” (another version of the subject) achieved a\r\nmarked success in Italy in 1868, and placed Boito among the remarkable\r\ncomposers of the day. As for Gounod, his other operas never equaled his\r\n“Faust.” Next in merit comes “Roméo et Juliette” (produced in Paris in\r\n1867) and then his “Mireille,” which appeared in 1864, and “Philémon\r\net Baucis,” an exquisite little comic opera produced in 1860. His last\r\nopera, “Le Tribut de Zamora,” was given at the Grand Opera, Paris, in\r\n1881, and failed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GIUSEPPE VERDI.]\r\n\r\nDonizetti, who died in Bergamo in 1848, was for many years one of the\r\nmost popular operatic composers. He possessed undoubted ability, but\r\nwrote carelessly, as the Italians did in that day. But his operas\r\ncontain much that is beautiful, and often show fine dramatic power. His\r\n“Lucia” contains inspired pages, while other portions are inexcusably\r\ncommonplace. The same remark applies to his “Lucrezia Borgia,” “La\r\nFavorita,” and “Maria di Rohan;” while in his comic operas, such as\r\n“Don Pasquale” (which was composed in three weeks), his “L’Elisire\r\nd’Amore” and “La Fille du Régiment,” Donizetti appears to better\r\nadvantage. They are melodious and very agreeably written. His fertility\r\nmay be imagined when you are told that he composed over sixty operas\r\nduring his career, as well as other compositions.\r\n\r\nBellini, whose career was a short one, as he was born in 1802 and died\r\nin 1835, was badly trained and could not be called a well-schooled\r\nmusician, being rather a musician by instinct. But he possessed\r\nremarkable ability, and, perceiving that the persistently florid style\r\nof Rossini (which all the composers of that time blindly imitated)\r\nwas approaching an end, treated his melodies with a simplicity and\r\ndirectness that at once attracted attention and met with approval.\r\n\r\nBellini’s knowledge of instrumentation was childish, but his intimacy\r\nwith Rubini, the famous tenor, aided him in achieving an admirable\r\ntreatment of the voice. His operas were very sweet and melodious. The\r\ntwo operas by which he will be remembered are “La Sonnambula” and\r\n“Norma,” the latter being, with all its faults, a great opera.\r\n\r\nAnother talented and prolific operatic composer was Mercadante, whose\r\n“Il Giuramento” (produced in 1837) achieved considerable popularity.\r\nBut Mercadante’s successes were generally confined to Italy. He\r\ncomposed sixty operas, and died in 1870 in Naples.\r\n\r\nPonchielli, who was born in 1834 and died in 1886, will be principally\r\nremembered by his remarkably beautiful opera, “La Gioconda” (produced\r\nin 1876), which, together with a re-written version of his first opera,\r\n“I Promessi Sposi,” gave him great popularity in Italy and spread his\r\nreputation to other countries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BEETHOVEN IN HIS STUDY.]\r\n\r\nAs for Italy’s young composers that profess to represent the modern\r\nItalian school of opera, they are led by Puccini, whose “Manon Lescaut”\r\nand “La Bohême” are melodious and full of merit.\r\n\r\nMascagni and Leoncavallo, whose “Cavalleria Rusticana” and “I\r\nPagliacci” achieved popularity, have not realized expectations. Nor has\r\nGiordano, whose “Andrea Chenier” was well received in Italy.\r\n\r\nBizet, whose “Carmen” is one of the most remarkable of modern operas,\r\ndied in Paris in 1875. “Carmen” has remained in the repertoire. His\r\nother opera, “Les Pécheurs de Perles,” only achieved a moderate success.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRAND OPERA HOUSE, PARIS.]\r\n\r\nOne of France’s greatest musicians, Hector Berlioz, was born in 1803\r\nand died in 1869. His operas, “Les Troyens,” “Benvenuto Cellini,” his\r\n“Damnation de Faust,” his “Roméo et Juliette” symphony, are all great\r\nand afforded Wagner a model that he imitated persistently.\r\n\r\nIn 1871 France lost one of its most talented operatic composers, Auber,\r\nwhose “Masaniello” and “Fra Diavolo” are two of the most popular operas\r\never written by a Frenchman. Auber composed comic operas charmingly,\r\nand his “Domino Noir,” “Diamants de la Couronne,” “Haydée,” and other\r\nworks of a similar character, entertained the French people for many\r\nyears. Auber’s death has left a vacancy that has not been filled.\r\n\r\nThe modern French composers cannot be called great. Saint-Saens,\r\nwhose most successful work is “Samson et Dalila” (which is more of an\r\noratorio than an opera, and which was produced in 1877), has composed\r\nother operas, such as “Henri VIII.,” “Ascanio,” et cetera, which lack\r\noriginality and inspiration.\r\n\r\nMassenet has composed “Le Roi de Lahore,” “Hérodiade,” “Manon,”\r\n“Werther,” et cetera, that have had passing successes.\r\n\r\nBoth Saint-Saens and Massenet have attempted to follow Wagner in their\r\nsonorous orchestration; but their works lack distinction. The French\r\ncomposers of to-day have been demoralized by Wagner’s affectations.\r\n\r\nThe death of Ambroise Thomas, in 1895, caused France the loss of one of\r\nher most successful and accomplished operatic composers, whose “Mignon”\r\nwill be long admired as a very charming opera comique, while his\r\n“Hamlet,” though containing portions that are ably written, has never\r\nattained outside France any remarkable success.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: METROPOLITAN OPERA HOUSE, NEW YORK.]\r\n\r\nReyer, whose “Sigurd” was produced in 1884 with considerable success,\r\nis a follower of Meyerbeer. His “Salammbo” was produced in 1890, but\r\ndid not attract the attention expected outside of France.\r\n\r\nGerman opera of the latter part of the century has been so demoralized\r\nby the influence of Wagner that the German composers have become little\r\nmore than imitators of his pronounced mannerisms.\r\n\r\nWeber’s “Der Freischütz” remains the most popular of German operas,\r\njust as Verdi’s “Il Trovatore” is the most popular of Italian operas.\r\n\r\nSpohr, Lindpainter, and many other German composers of ability have\r\nbeen laid on the shelf.\r\n\r\nMarshner, who died in Hanover in 1861, showed in his “Hans Heiling”\r\nthat he was a follower of Weber, as well as in his “Templar and Jewess.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM RICHARD WAGNER.]\r\n\r\nCornelius, who died in Mainz in 1874, made his principal success with\r\nhis “Barber of Bagdad,” a comic opera in which the manner of Wagner was\r\nimitated. In 1864 “The Cid” was produced in Weimar, but it was found\r\ndepressingly heavy and labored.\r\n\r\nGoldmark, a follower of Meyerbeer, made a success in 1875 with his\r\n“Queen of Saba” that was not equaled by his “Merlin,” produced in 1886,\r\nor his “Prisoner of War,” produced in 1899.\r\n\r\nTo return to the great leader of opera—Verdi—one may say of him that\r\nhis operas are divided into three periods. The first included the\r\nworks written in the old Neapolitan style as he had found it. To this\r\nclass belong “Nabucco,” “Attila,” et cetera. To the second period,\r\nwhich shows remarkable dramatic color and beautiful melody, belong\r\n“Rigoletto,” “Ernani,” and “Ballo in Maschera” (in which Verdi began\r\nto pay attention to his instrumentation). To the third period belongs\r\n“Aïda,” which is his most characteristic and remarkable opera, in which\r\nthe melody is wonderfully fresh and beautiful, combined with remarkable\r\nscience.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EDWIN FORREST.]\r\n\r\n“Otello” is also a great work, written at a time of life when most\r\ncomposers retire, and broadly dramatic in its treatment of the\r\nsituations, illuminated by rich and expressive instrumentation.\r\n\r\nAs for “Falstaff,” the latest opera that Verdi has written, and\r\nprobably the last he will write, it is the greatest modern comic opera,\r\njust as Mozart’s “Nozze di Figaro” is the greatest comic opera of the\r\npast. It convinces the world that Verdi’s genius is inexhaustible.\r\n\r\nNext to Verdi comes Wagner, the anarchist of music, who began in\r\n“Rienzi” and “The Flying Dutchman” by imitating the Italian forms of\r\nmelody. In “Tannhäuser,” portions are very beautiful and melodious;\r\nin “Lohengrin,” portions are fine; but Wagner’s idea of effect was\r\nbad and he never knew when to stop, so that many of the scenes are\r\ninterminable. This fault increased as Wagner composed the “Nibelungen”\r\nseries for the crazy king of Bavaria. Melody vanished, the singers\r\nbecame secondary to the orchestra, which was persistently noisy.\r\nWagner’s effort was to create a new school of opera, in which\r\neverything should be minutely descriptive. He went too far and opened\r\nthe question of failure. In opera the voices claim the first place,\r\nand the orchestra is an accompaniment, so that Wagner’s method was\r\nradically wrong.\r\n\r\nIndependent of this, he attempted to infuse life into the “Nibelungen”\r\nseries, whereas he adopted a tangled and childish fairy-story that\r\nwas more absurd than impressive. The later Wagner operas, which the\r\ncomposer calls “music dramas,” are tiresome and monotonous to such a\r\ndegree that, with all the remarkable talent of Wagner, they may never\r\nbecome popular, and may be eventually laid on the shelf, to be regarded\r\nin the future as musical curios.\r\n\r\nThe musicians of the United States are steadily developing, and for\r\nso young a country we have a large number of composers of first-class\r\nability, such as Macdowell, Foote, Lang, Chadwick, Gilchrist, and many\r\nothers who have produced important compositions.\r\n\r\nIn opera the American composers have done nothing, for the reason that\r\nthere are no opportunities for the production of such works. If there\r\nwere, we should soon have many operatic composers, and should speedily\r\ntake high rank in the lyric drama.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. DRAMA.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLOTTE SAUNDERS CUSHMAN.]\r\n\r\nThe theatre of the latter part of the century shows a remarkable\r\nadvance, in certain respects, over the theatre of the past, which\r\nconsisted of a “star,” an inferior company, poor scenery and\r\nappointments, et cetera; whereas to-day there are many more really\r\ngood actors and actresses, the theatres are far more comfortable and\r\nartistic, the scenery, costumes and details are beautiful and correct.\r\n\r\nWe have no Mrs. Siddons, no Kemble, no Rachel, no Talma; but we are\r\nconfident that the actors and actresses of to-day are like the theatre\r\nof to-day,—they have more finish, and the results, while they may not\r\nrise to the plane of the school of Shakespeare, are nearer nature than\r\nthey have ever been.\r\n\r\nThe school of declamation, which belonged to the plays of the past,\r\nis the severest loss the stage of to-day has felt. The actors and\r\nactresses fail in elocution. They do not know where to put their\r\nemphasis. They seem lost when they appear in costume, and Shakespeare\r\nto-day has no distinguished exponents.\r\n\r\nThe English-speaking stage of the century has been adorned by such\r\neloquent interpreters and powerful tragedians as Edwin Forrest,\r\nCharlotte Cushman, Edwin Booth, and Henry Irving. But this illustrious\r\nroll has been almost extinguished by death; and, especially if applied\r\nto America, the question may well be asked, where is the actor or\r\nactress who can play Hamlet, or Macbeth, or King Lear, or Shylock as we\r\nwere wont to see them rendered by those masters of the dramatic art, or\r\nas they should be rendered? Salvini and Rossi have both passed away.\r\nIrving verges on retiracy. Of the great dramatic actresses left to the\r\nclosing of the century, Mme. Sarah Bernhardt stands preëminent. The day\r\nof the imposing declamatory drama seems to have lost its lustre at the\r\nsunset of the century.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCENE FROM SHAKESPEARE’S PLAY OF “ROMEO AND JULIET.”]\r\n\r\nBut the modern dramas and comedies are acted, even in the smaller\r\nparts, with admirable intelligence and effect, and we may add that the\r\nvice that disgraced the stage of the past is by no means so visible in\r\nthe theatre of the present.\r\n\r\nThe coarseness that clung so long to the theatre is gradually\r\ndisappearing, and the theatre-goers of to-day have discovered that the\r\ntheatre, which was created to entertain the world, can do so without\r\nrecourse to vulgarity.\r\n\r\nThe theatres of the United States are the handsomest and most\r\nconvenient in the world. This Mme. Sarah Bernhardt acknowledged the\r\nother day, while criticising the theatres of Paris, which lack many\r\nconveniences.\r\n\r\nUp to within twenty-five years of the close of the century, plays\r\nwritten by American authors were rare. Managers had to rely upon those\r\ncomposed in Europe. But at present the United States possesses many\r\nable and successful playwrights, just as it does its artists in all\r\ndepartments. There has not been a time during the century when the\r\npersonal character of actors and actresses has escaped discussion, and\r\nsometimes violent criticism, by those prejudiced against the theatre.\r\nThis does not seem to have lessened the estimation in which dramatic\r\nart is held, nor to have seriously diminished in number the legion\r\nwho find in the drama their most pleasurable recreation and keenest\r\nintellectual delight. In answer to challenges of the morality of the\r\nstage, Bronson Howard has fittingly said: “I have never yet seen\r\nanybody who wanted a bad picture just because it was painted by a good\r\nman. It is society that corrupts the stage, not the stage that corrupts\r\nsociety.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CENTURY’S LITERATURE\r\n\r\nBY JAMES P. BOYD, A.M., L.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn contrasting the world’s nineteenth century literature with that of\r\nthe eighteenth, one is impressed with the many remarkable differences.\r\nBut by no means all of such differences are to the discredit of the\r\nolder literature. As instances, the prose literature of the nineteenth\r\ncentury may not surpass that of the eighteenth in elegance and\r\naccuracy of expression, though its progress has been very marked in\r\nthe diversity of its applications to mental needs; and the poetical\r\nliterature of the nineteenth century may not excel that of the\r\neighteenth in beauty and virility, though it has advanced in loftiness\r\nof theme and tenderness of mode. And so, when literature is divided\r\ninto its many minor branches, as history, philosophy, the sciences,\r\netc., various features of the old compare favorably with the new.\r\n\r\nIt is in its general tone and universal aptitude that the literature\r\nof the nineteenth century stands out preëminent. The wonderful\r\nintellectual activity of the century has been, as it were, compelled\r\nto go forth along literary lines quite parallel with those that\r\ndistinguish other fields of activity. This may have had a tendency in\r\nsome instances to rob the century’s literature of some of the sweetly\r\nimaginative elements, and to harden it in some of its essential forms,\r\nbut the process was necessary to secure for it just that quality which\r\nwould best meet a progressive demand. As the drift of human energy\r\nwas toward the practical, so the dominant literary thought took on\r\nthe form of direct and exact expression. There was less and less room\r\nfor the indulgence of literary foible or speculative whimsicality.\r\nEven where elegance of style met with occasional sacrifice, it was\r\nmore than compensated by that general rise in literary tone which\r\nhas characterized the century. Literature could not be untruthful\r\namid active inquiry and scientific progress. It must reflect, more\r\naccurately than ever before, its birth inspirations and its legitimate\r\nuses. It must keep even pace with the demands for it. A world crying\r\nfor intellectual bread could not be put off with an antiquated stone.\r\n\r\nWithout closer analysis, the above is true of the literature of all\r\nreading and writing peoples who have kept touch with the century’s\r\nprogress. But it is especially true in the literature of English\r\nspeaking peoples. History has, in accordance with a growing spirit of\r\nresearch, become more truthful, philosophy more expressive, and science\r\nmore exact. The outcrop of books shows the yearnings of the century,\r\nnot only as to their number but as to theme and treatment. Authors have\r\nmultiplied as during no other world’s era, and the proportion of those\r\nwho have attained permanent distinction was never larger.\r\n\r\n“German literature,” says Professor Ford, in “Self Culture” for\r\nFebruary, 1899, “has had its measure of ups and downs, but its first\r\nage was its golden age. From the beginning of the century to the\r\npresent day is a far cry in German letters. Romanticism, idealism,\r\nrealism—the Fatherland has lived through them all. And for what? In\r\na land of scholars no great philosopher; among hosts of verse-makers\r\nno great poet; among innumerable story-writers, not one who has become\r\nknown over a continent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEORGE BANCROFT.]\r\n\r\n“Still these last years in Germany have not been without some good work\r\ndone, though often achieved under the spur of wrong ideals and improper\r\nmotives. From the days of ’48, when Young Germany felt for the first\r\ntime the seductive charm of revolutionism, a new feeling has possessed\r\nGerman literature—a feeling that the past is past and out of date,\r\npotent once but potent no longer, and that the new age of man demands\r\nnew principles, new ideals, a new faith. And so the modern literature,\r\nparticularly so since 1870, has been marked by iconoclasm and startling\r\ninnovation; it has discarded sentiment and line writing, and made a\r\nplea for scientific methods, with the privilege of exhibiting exact,\r\nscientific results. Crimes, disease, and grinning skeletons have\r\nbeen dragged forth to the public gaze, for art is no longer art that\r\nportrays the ideal and not the true. Such, in short, is the creed by\r\nwhich the realistic or naturalistic school has thought to overthrow\r\nthe old, conventional, and frivolous, to foster the spirit of the new\r\nnationality, and prepare a balm for the wounds of the poor.\r\n\r\n“Two men stand to-day as leaders of this new movement,—Hermann\r\nSudermann and Gerhardt Hauptmann,—the most commanding figures in\r\ncontemporaneous German literature.”\r\n\r\nDuring the nineteenth century the United States took a high and firm\r\nplace in the domain of literature, and, it may be said, has evolved\r\na literature that in scope and style is peculiar to her institutions\r\nand environment. Her array of authors, both in number and reputation,\r\ncompares favorably with that of countries boasting of a thousand years\r\nof literary domination, and her literature is as diversified and\r\npractical as her activities. Among the many illustrious historians of\r\nthe century she numbers her Bancroft, her Hildreth, her Prescott, her\r\nMotley, worthy counterparts of England’s Lingard, Hallam, Macaulay,\r\nBuckle, and Kinglake. Among her poets are Longfellow, Whittier, Bryant,\r\nLowell, Halleck, fit companions of Tennyson, Browning, Wordsworth,\r\nScott, Swinburne. Among her novelists are Cooper, Hawthorne, Stowe,\r\nworthy congeners of Dickens, Thackeray, and Eliot. And so, the\r\ncomparison holds in travel, philosophy, theology, law, and science.\r\n\r\nIf in dramatic literature the United States has, during the century,\r\nproduced few authors of permanent reputation, and perhaps none to be\r\ncompared with Knowles, Boucicault, Taylor, and Robertson, of the Old\r\nWorld, nevertheless it cannot be said of these that their plays have\r\nhad more than a stage value. The drama of the century in following\r\nthe demand for artistic and commercial results has sustained only in\r\npart the reputation of its literature. But in lieu of this partial\r\ndecadence, there have sprung up new branches of literature which are,\r\nin a measure, compensatory. Among these are the critical literature\r\nof arts and design, the literature of philology, or of language, and\r\nthe literature of political and social science. To these must be added\r\ntwo other kinds or classes of literature which, if not peculiar to the\r\ncentury, have yet found in it their most surprising evolution, greatest\r\nglory, and widest influence. These are the literature of the newspaper\r\nand magazine, as distinguished from that of the book.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN G. WHITTIER.]\r\n\r\nBut before making further mention of these, let us read somewhat of New\r\nWorld literature as viewed from a critical English standpoint. Says\r\nthe critic, “English critics are apt to bear down on the writers and\r\nthinkers of the New World with a sort of aristocratic hauteur; they\r\nare perpetually reminding them of their immaturity and their disregard\r\nof the golden mean. Americans, on the other hand, are hard to please.\r\nOrdinary men among them are as sensitive to foreign censure as the\r\n_irritable genius_ of other lands. Mr. Emerson is permitted to impress\r\nhome truths on his countrymen, as ‘Your American eagle is very well;\r\nbut beware of the American peacock.’ Such remarks are not permitted to\r\nEnglishmen. If they point to any flaws in transatlantic manners or ways\r\nof thinking with an effort after politeness, it is ‘the good-natured\r\ncynicism of well-to-do age;’ if they commend transatlantic institutions\r\nor achievements, it is, according to Mr. Lowell, ‘with that pleasant\r\nEuropean air of self-compliment in condescending to be pleased by\r\nAmerican merit which we find so conciliating.’\r\n\r\n“Now that the United States have reached their full majority, it is\r\ntime that England should cease to assume the attitude of guardian,\r\nand time that they should be on the alert to resent the assumption.\r\nForemost among the more attractive features of transatlantic [American]\r\nliterature is its _freshness_. The authority which is the guide of old\r\nnations constantly threatens to become tyrannical; they wear their\r\ntraditions like a chain; and, in canonization of laws of taste, the\r\ncreative laws are depressed. Even in England we write under fixed\r\nconditions; with the fear of critics before our eyes, we are all bound\r\nto cast our ideas into similar moulds, and the name of ‘free thinker’\r\nhas grown to a term of reproach. Bunyan’s ‘Pilgrim’s Progress’ is\r\nperhaps the last English book written without a thought of being\r\nreviewed. There is a gain in the habit of self-restraint fostered by\r\nthis state of things; but there is a loss in the consequent lack of\r\nspontaneity; and we may learn something from a literature that is ever\r\nready for adventures. In America the love of uniformity gives place\r\nto impetuous impulses; the most extreme sentiments are made audible,\r\nthe most noxious ‘have their day and cease to be;’ and the truth being\r\nleft to vindicate itself, the overthrow of error, though more gradual,\r\nmay at last prove more complete. A New England poet can write with\r\nconfidence of his country as the land\r\n\r\n   “‘Where no one suffers loss or bleeds\r\n     For thoughts that men calls heresies.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALFRED TENNYSON.]\r\n\r\n“Another feature of American literature is _comprehensiveness_. What it\r\nhas lost in depth it has gained in breadth. Addressing a vast audience,\r\nit appeals to universal sympathies. In the Northern States, where\r\ncomparatively few have leisure to write well, almost every man, woman,\r\nand child can read, and does read. Books are to be found in every\r\nlog-hut, and public questions are discussed by every scavenger. During\r\nthe Civil War, when the Lowell factory-girls were writing verses, the\r\n‘Biglow Papers’ were being recited in every smithy. The consequence is,\r\nthat, setting aside the newspapers, there is little that is sectional\r\nin the popular religion or literature; it exalts and despises no\r\nclass, and almost wholly ignores the lines that in other countries\r\ndivide the upper ten thousand and the lower ten million. Where manners\r\nmake men, the people are proud of their peerage, but they blush for\r\ntheir boors. In the New World there are no ‘Grand Seigniors’ and no\r\nhuman vegetables; and if there are fewer giants, there are also fewer\r\nmanikins. American poets recognize no essential distinction between\r\nthe ‘village blacksmith’ and the ‘caste of Vere de Vere.’ Burns speaks\r\nfor the one; Byron and Tennyson for the other; Longfellow, to the\r\nextent of his genius, for both. The same spirit which glorifies labor\r\ndenounces every form of despotism but that of the multitude. Freed of\r\nthe excesses due to wide license, and restrained by the good taste and\r\nculture of her nobler minds, we may anticipate for the literature of\r\nAmerica, under the mellowing influences of time, an illustrious future.”\r\n\r\nIn treating of newspaper literature, one cannot proceed without\r\nblending its origin, style and aims with the business enterprise\r\nthat cultivates and supports it. And this may be done all the more\r\ncheerfully and properly, for the reason that there is no history\r\nmore interesting than that of the evolution of the newspaper, and no\r\nconsummation of mental and physical energy that places the nineteenth\r\ncentury in more vivid contrast with preceding centuries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HENRY W. LONGFELLOW.]\r\n\r\nFor the fatherhood of the newspaper we have to travel to a land and\r\ndate calculated to rob modern civilization of some of its boastfulness.\r\nThe oldest known newspaper is the “Tsing-Pao,” or “Peking News,”\r\nmention of whose publication is made in Chinese annals as far back\r\nas A. D. 713, when it was then, as now, the official chronicler of\r\nthe acts of the emperor, the doings of the court, and the reports of\r\nministers. It has appeared daily for nearly fourteen hundred years, in\r\nthe form of a yellow-covered magazine, some 3¾ by 7½ inches in size.\r\nThe pages number twenty-four, and are printed from wooden movable type.\r\nTwo editions are published, one on superior paper, for the Court and\r\nupper classes; the other on inferior paper, for general readers. Its\r\neditorship is in the Grand Council of State, which furnishes to scribes\r\nor reporters the news deemed fit for publication. As an official organ,\r\nit first finds circulation among the heads of provinces, and is by\r\nthem further distributed to patrons. This ancient purveyor of news\r\nseems to have pretty fully gratified the Chinese taste for that kind\r\nof literature; for even at the present day there are few newspapers\r\nin the empire published in the native language. The few that have\r\nsprung up are confined to the larger cities, as Shanghai, Hongkong, and\r\nPeking, where they are liberally patronized. But their circulation and\r\ninfluence do not extend far into the interior, owing to the lack of\r\npostal facilities. The modern Chinese newspaper can hardly be called a\r\nnative enterprise. It grew out of the necessity for a literature and a\r\nmeans of news communication which arose at the time the Chinese ports\r\nwere forced open to the world’s commerce. As a consequence, a majority\r\nof the Chinese publications have found their inception in foreign\r\nbrains and capital, and remain under the management of foreigners. The\r\nsame is true of Japan, where the modern native newspaper practically\r\ndates from the arrival of the foreigner. But by reason of their greater\r\nmental and commercial activity, and the rapidity with which they\r\nadjusted themselves to modern modes of civilization, the Japanese have\r\nfar outstripped the Chinese in their evolution of newspaper literature\r\nand enterprise. Whereas, what may be called the first modern Japanese\r\nnewspaper was founded in 1872, there sprang up in the following twenty\r\nyears the almost incredible number of 648 newspapers and periodicals,\r\nnot only due to native capital and enterprise, but under native\r\ncontrol. This wonderful growth took place, too, in the face of the\r\nseverest code of press laws existing in any country.\r\n\r\nIn Europe, the earliest inklings of a newspaper literature consisted of\r\nnews pamphlets of infrequent and uncertain publication, and dependent\r\nfor circulation upon temporary demand. The earliest departure from\r\nthis stage was in Germany, in 1615, when the “Frankfurter Journal” was\r\norganized as a weekly publication, for the purpose of “collecting\r\nand circulating the news of the day.” Antwerp followed with a similar\r\nenterprise in 1616. The first attempt to do likewise in Great Britain\r\nwas in 1622, when “The Weekly News” was founded in London. None\r\nof these enterprises were by editors, in a modern sense, but by\r\nstationers, in the line of their ordinary trade. They did not depend\r\nfor patronage on regular subscribers, but sold their publications on\r\nthe streets through the agency of hawkers, corresponding to our modern\r\nnewsboys, though they bore the classical name of “mercuries.”\r\n\r\nThe foundation of the first newspaper in France that attained\r\npermanence and fame was in 1631. It was called the “Gazette de\r\nFrance,” and owed its origin to a demand for mingled news and original\r\ndiscussion. It was largely under the control of Richelieu, and, of\r\ncourse, reflected his sentiments. In these beginnings of the newspaper,\r\nwe find little or no attempt at journalism, as now understood and\r\npracticed; no promise and potency of a literature peculiar to newspaper\r\nenterprise. The journalist had yet to come into being. He first\r\nappeared as a writer of “news-letters,” generally from some capital,\r\nor seat of legislation, or commercial centre. His duty was to keep a\r\nline of masters or patrons supplied with news during their absence from\r\ncourt, legislative hall, or business mart. His duty evolved into a\r\ncalling. His patrons became regular paying subscribers, to each of whom\r\nhe wrote. These letters, coming from all countries of the continent\r\nof Europe, and covering a wide field of information, became of great\r\ninterest, and many collections of them are still in existence in\r\nlibraries, adding no little to their historic value.\r\n\r\nThe step was easy from this journalistic stage to the regular periodic\r\npublication, open not only to the “news-letter,” but to discursive\r\nthought. Thus, in 1641, “The Weekly News,” of London, began the\r\npublication of parliamentary proceedings in addition to its budget of\r\n“news-letters.” This era witnessed a rapid establishment of weekly\r\nnewspapers, requiring editorial supervision and regular contributions.\r\nThey were not without their vicissitudes. Many of their careers were\r\nbrief and marked with pecuniary losses; yet out of the wreckage sprang\r\nsome of the most important of the modern journals.\r\n\r\nBy 1703 Great Britain was ripe for a daily newspaper, and in that year\r\none appeared under the name of “The Daily Courant.” The advent of this\r\nenterprise gave further impetus to newspaper publication. The English\r\npress of the eighteenth century rose into great popular favor. It was\r\nable, and quite too independent for royalty and royal courtier. For\r\ncorrupt and ambitious government it often became a whip of scorpions,\r\nand in revenge was both severely taxed and invidiously censored. But\r\nit seemed to prosper amid opposition and persecution, and by 1776\r\nfifty-three newspapers were published in London alone. During the\r\nreign of George III. (1760–1820) the history of the English newspaper\r\nis one of criminal persecutions, amid which editors and contributors\r\nwere repeatedly defeated, and sometimes severely punished; yet it\r\nis doubtful if at any period the press gained greater strength from\r\nprotracted conflict, or turned ignominious penalties into more signal\r\ntriumphs. It is significant that out of this dark, tumultuous, and\r\nforbidding era sprang many of the newspapers whose influence is most\r\npotential to-day in English affairs of state and in the literature\r\nof journalism. The era marks the turn in newspaper values. The\r\nestablishment became a concrete thing, a lively property, an energy\r\ncomposed of practical business minds, surrounded and supported by the\r\nbest procurable literary talent, adapted for treating diversified\r\ntopics. Thus “The London Morning Chronicle,” founded in 1789, rose\r\nto be a property in 1823 which sold for $210,000; while “The Morning\r\nPost” not only gave to Coleridge his fame as one of the greatest of\r\npublicists, but enlisted the brilliant attainments of Mackintosh,\r\nSouthey, Young, and Moore. The sturdy “London Times,” which dates\r\nfrom 1785, and for years encountered malignant royal hostility,\r\nproved itself strong enough to brave the government and at the same\r\ntime sufficiently enterprising to introduce steam printing and every\r\nmechanism calculated to give it precedence as a metropolitan journal.\r\nAs a property, it is to-day worth a figure incredible at the beginning\r\nof the century, and so powerful was its hold on popular favor for the\r\nfirst half of the century that no other daily could compete with it.\r\nIndeed, it may be said to have had a lone field up to the establishment\r\nof “The Daily News,” in 1846, “The Daily Telegraph,” in 1855, and “The\r\nStandard,” in 1857.\r\n\r\nThe nineteenth century journalism of Great Britain is characterized\r\nby its great plenitude. Morning and evening papers abound in all the\r\ncentres. The weekly paper is still an important literary and news\r\nfactor. Class papers are numerous and excellent in their way. Again,\r\nthe century’s journalism is characterized by its property value.\r\nMany of the leading English journals have become immense properties\r\nworth millions of dollars each, and requiring the ablest management\r\nto improve and perpetuate them. Further, the English press is\r\ncharacterized by able and conservative, if prosaic, editorial methods.\r\nIts correspondence is cautious, and covers every important field. Its\r\nnews columns, so far as they depend on the telegraph and telephone, are\r\nsprightly and well filled, but limited and dull when the local reporter\r\nis the source of supply.\r\n\r\nAs already stated, the annals of French journalism began with the\r\nfounding of the “Gazette de France” in 1631. The evolution of the\r\nFrench newspaper was not rapid till the eighteenth century was well\r\nalong, when the era of the first revolution called for a news and\r\nliterature peculiar to bloody and exciting times. Myriads of newspapers\r\nsprang into existence, all but two of which found their graves with\r\nthe passing of the emergency which called them into being. Early in\r\nthe nineteenth century (1836) the introduction of cheap journalism\r\ngave great impetus to enterprise, and by the middle of the century the\r\nnumber and circulation of French newspapers had more than trebled.\r\nThis rate has been, in great part, sustained throughout the latter\r\nhalf of the century, and the French people are to-day abundantly\r\nsupplied with a newspaper literature which for vivacity and amplitude\r\nis unexcelled. It may not have the solid and lasting influence of the\r\nsoberer outcrop of other nations, but it is singularly adapted to a\r\nsprightly and mercurial people, and is well sustentative of the great\r\npolitical transition of the people and empire since the beginning of\r\nthe nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe evolution of the newspaper in Germany was slow. Between 1615, the\r\ndate of the founding of the “Frankfurter Journal,” and 1798, when the\r\n“Allgemeine Zeitung” (General News) was founded by the bookseller\r\nCotta, at Leipsic, no journals of a high order made their appearance,\r\nand it needed the inspiration of the French Revolution to beget in the\r\nGerman mind a desire for a livelier newspaper literature than had\r\npreëxisted. Thus, the “Zeitung” soon sprang into great popularity as\r\na purveyor of news and as a medium of discussion, and has ever since\r\nmaintained a leading place in the German political press. It not only\r\nset the style of the press at the turn of the century, but proved to\r\nbe a pioneer in that wonderful journalistic march which spread over\r\nall German-speaking countries during the nineteenth century, giving\r\nto them media of news and discussion as able and influential as exist\r\nin any land. By 1870 there existed in Germany proper 3780 newspapers\r\nand periodicals; in Austria-Hungary, 700; in Switzerland, 300; not\r\nto mention the many hundreds printed in German in other countries,\r\nespecially in the United States. A proportionate increase would greatly\r\naugment the above figures by the end of the century. The rise of German\r\nsocialism proved to be a prolific source of journalism. The socialist\r\nseems to be a born editor and literary combatant. He is also a great\r\nreader and bold and independent thinker. Under the socialistic demand\r\nfor a literature peculiar to itself, there has arisen a score of German\r\nprinting-offices and perhaps fifty political journals, a third of which\r\nare dailies.\r\n\r\nIn the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Russia, Italy,\r\nSpain, Portugal, and other European countries, the press of the\r\nnineteenth century has kept pace with the mental needs and spirit of\r\nenterprise of the respective peoples. Indeed, there is no such an\r\naccurate criterion of the general make-up of a people, of their place\r\nin the lines of progress, of their influence upon civilization, as\r\nthat afforded by their press. The Belgian press is nimbly commercial,\r\nthat of the Netherlands prosy and substantial, while that of the\r\nScandinavian countries is rugged, accurate, and solemnly influential.\r\nThe Russian press, where free, is despotic and unprogressive. But it is\r\nso frequently under censorship that it can hardly be said to reflect\r\nwith any degree of certainty the popular spirit of the empire. The\r\nItalian press is indolent and easy-going, inaccurate, spicy by spasms,\r\nof little relative influence, except as it has been improved since the\r\nunification of the Italian States. Spain is a country of 18,000,000\r\npeople, but has fewer newspapers and periodicals than the single State\r\nof New York. Of Spain’s 1200 papers, only 500 are newspapers. Of the\r\nrest, 300 are scientific journals, mostly monthly, 100 are devoted to\r\nreligion, and 30 to satire, music, poetry, art, etc. Barcelona and\r\nMadrid are the great centres of journalistic literature. The political\r\npapers are the most powerful. The reading public of Spain is limited,\r\nand the average circulation of a Spanish newspaper is only about 1200\r\ncopies.\r\n\r\nIn the New World the demand for newspaper literature during the\r\nnineteenth century has proven quite as strong as in the Old World,\r\nand, in certain localities, even stronger. Even among the youthful and\r\ntumultuous republics of South America, with their large percentages\r\nof lower classes and illiterates, there are few centres of importance\r\nthat do not support respectable and fairly influential journals. The\r\nnews-gathering and news-consuming spirit may not be so active as\r\nelsewhere, nor the commercial sense so acute, yet the century has laid\r\nthe groundwork of journalistic enterprise so firmly that future years\r\ncan afford to build upon it with certainty. The same may be said of\r\njournalism in Mexico and the other Latin republics of North America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BENJAMIN FRANKLIN.]\r\n\r\nIn Canada, the century shows a highly complimentary growth in newspaper\r\nliterature and influence. Great pride is taken in accurate and able\r\neditorship, and in that kind of management which is best calculated\r\nto convert investment into permanent and profitable property. What\r\nthey lack on the reportorial, or strictly newsy, side, they make up\r\nin free, clean, and independent discussion. The people are readers\r\nand, therefore, generous supporters of the enterprises designed to\r\nsupply them with their periodical literature. During the century\r\nthe newspapers and periodicals of Canada increased in number from\r\na very few to 862, as reported in 1894. Of these, 87 are dailies,\r\n583 weeklies, 138 monthlies, 3 tri-weeklies, 22 semi-weeklies, 6\r\nbi-weeklies, 21 semi-monthlies, 2 quarterlies. The largest centres\r\nof circulation are the province of Ontario with 507 newspapers and\r\nperiodicals, and Quebec with 132.\r\n\r\nThe century’s grandest field for journalistic opportunity has been\r\nthe United States. Here journalism has developed with the greatest\r\nrapidity, exemplified its manifold features to the fullest extent,\r\nmost successfully proved its influence as an educative and civilizing\r\nagency. Starting with the great and essential encouragement of freedom,\r\nit has found unremitting and energetic propulsion in the unprecedented\r\ngrowth of population, in the marvelous activities requiring\r\nintercommunication of thought, in an intelligence which constantly\r\nrecruited armies of omnivorous readers, and in facilities for the\r\npreparation and dissemination of the literature at command.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of newspaper enterprise in the United States was in\r\nBoston, in 1690, when the “Publick Occurrences” appeared under the\r\nauspices of Benjamin Harris. It was designed to be a monthly, and was\r\nprinted on three sides of a folded sheet, each side being only eleven\r\ninches long by seven wide. It was suppressed after its first issue by\r\nthe colonial government of Massachusetts, thus restricting the avenues\r\nof news to the foreign journals or local coffee-houses. But the demand\r\nfor home news was not thus to be crushed. There sprang up a medium of\r\ncommunication by news-letters, such as then existed in England; and in\r\n1704 the postmaster of Boston undertook to keep certain functionaries\r\ninformed of the course of events by a periodical news-letter in printed\r\nform. This he called “The News-Letter,” a title which, with some, is\r\ntreated as that of a newspaper. It was to appear weekly, and would be\r\nsent to subscribers for such reasonable sum as might be agreed upon.\r\nAfter a lapse of fifteen years, without competition, it had attained a\r\nsubscription list of only three hundred copies. A subsequent postmaster\r\nstarted an opposition sheet in 1719, called “The Boston Gazette.”\r\nIts appearance caused him to lose his office, but the rival papers\r\ncontinued to exist, “The News-Letter” up to the evacuation of Boston by\r\nthe British troops in 1776, and the “Gazette” up to 1754.\r\n\r\n“The Boston Gazette” appeared on December 21, 1719. One day after,\r\nDecember 22, 1719, Andrew Bradford started “The American Weekly\r\nMercury” at Philadelphia. On August 17, 1721, James Franklin started\r\n“The New England Courant,” on which Benjamin Franklin learned the trade\r\nof printer. After an existence of seven years its publication ceased.\r\nOn October 23, 1725, William Bradford started “The New York Gazette.”\r\n“The New England Weekly Journal” succeeded “The Boston Gazette” and\r\n“Courant” in 1727. “The Maryland Gazette,” the first paper published\r\nin that colony, appeared in 1727. In 1728 Samuel Keimer started “The\r\nUniversal Instructor in all the Arts and Sciences and Pennsylvania\r\nGazette,” at Philadelphia. The following year Benjamin Franklin bought\r\nKeimer’s plant, and shortened the name to “The Pennsylvania Gazette.”\r\nThe first paper in the colony of South Carolina, called “The South\r\nCarolina Gazette,” was published on January 8, 1731. On November\r\n5, 1733, “The New York Weekly Journal” appeared as a rival to the\r\n“Gazette.” In 1736 the first newspaper appeared in Virginia. It was\r\npublished at Williamsburg, and was called “The Virginia Gazette.” In\r\n1739 a German newspaper appeared at Germantown, Pa., and another, in\r\n1743, at Philadelphia. All these pioneer papers, with the exception of\r\na few, notably “The Pennsylvania Gazette” under Franklin, and “The New\r\nYork Weekly Journal” under Zenger, were merely news purveyors, or, if\r\nany opinions were expressed, they were in accord with the authorities\r\nof the day.\r\n\r\nAfter 1745 the press of the colonies became more independent and\r\nprogressive, in obedience to a demand for literature bearing upon the\r\nquestions relating to the coming revolution. New journals of the weekly\r\nclass sprang up with considerable rapidity and, for the most part, in\r\nopposition to England’s methods of colonial government. Among these\r\nwere “The Boston Independent Advocate,” started under the auspices\r\nof Samuel Adams, in 1748; “The New Hampshire Gazette,” in 1756; “The\r\nBoston Gazette and Country Gentleman,” in 1755; the “Newport (R. I.)\r\nMercury,” in 1758; “The Connecticut Courant,” in 1764.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HORACE GREELEY.\r\n\r\nFounder of “New York Tribune.”]\r\n\r\nBy 1775, the commencement of the struggle for independence, the\r\ncolonial press numbered thirty publications, all weekly. Of these,\r\nseven were published in Massachusetts, one in New Hampshire, two in\r\nRhode Island, three in Connecticut, eight in Pennsylvania, and three in\r\nNew York. In the first year of the war eight new weeklies were added\r\nto the list, four of them being in Philadelphia. On December 3, 1777,\r\nthe first newspaper, “The Gazette,” appeared in New Jersey, and in\r\n1781, the first in Vermont, “The Gazette or Green Mountain Post Boy.”\r\nSuch was the fatality overhanging the colonial press that, of the\r\nsixty-three newspapers which had come into existence prior to 1783,\r\nonly forty-three survived at that date.\r\n\r\nFrom 1789, the date on which the Constitution went into operation,\r\ntill the close of the eighteenth century and early beginning of the\r\nnineteenth, several newspapers were founded, most of which were\r\nardently political, and, though employing writers of ability, were\r\nbitterly vituperative. The most powerful of this class were “The\r\nAurora” of Philadelphia, Jefferson’s leading organ; “The Evening Post”\r\nof New York, the organ of the Federalists; and “The American Citizen”\r\nof New York, an organ of the Clintonian democracy. The close of the\r\neighteenth century witnessed also the advent of the press in the\r\nMississippi Valley. “The Centinel of the Northwestern Territory” was\r\nstarted at Cincinnati, November 9, 1793; and “The Scioto Gazette,” at\r\nChillicothe, in 1796.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN W. FORNEY.\r\n\r\nFounder of “Philadelphia Press.”]\r\n\r\nThe press of the early part of the nineteenth century grew rapidly in\r\nnumber, circulation, and influence. While it was largely partisan,\r\nthe field of discussion gradually broadened, and the news departments\r\nbecame more vivacious and comprehensive. Many of the newspapers\r\nfounded during the first decades of the century exist at its close,\r\nhaving enjoyed their long careers of influence with honor, and become\r\nproperties of incalculable value. During this period the transition\r\nfrom the weekly to the daily newspaper gradually went on in the\r\nlarge cities. The first American daily paper, “The American Daily\r\nAdvertiser,” was published at Philadelphia in 1784. With it came\r\nthe first use of reporters, or regularly employed news-gatherers,\r\nan innovation as important to the public as the advent of the daily\r\nitself. Special, or class, newspapers also began to get a firm foothold\r\nduring this period. “The Niles’s Weekly Register” appeared in Baltimore\r\nin 1811. The first religious newspaper attempted in the United States\r\nappeared at Chillicothe, O., 1814. The first of the agricultural press\r\nwas “The American Farmer,” which appeared at Baltimore, April 2, 1818,\r\nto be followed by “The Ploughman,” at Albany, N. Y., in 1821, and by\r\n“The New England Farmer,” in 1822. Several strictly commercial and\r\nfinancial papers found an origin in this period, the most successful of\r\nwhich was “The New Orleans Prices Current,” established in 1822.\r\n\r\nDuring this period the newspaper, whether daily or weekly, was\r\ndistributed only to the regular subscriber,—the price of a single\r\ncopy on the street being prohibitory. The slow-going mail facilities\r\nof the time prevented the large circulations that are credited to\r\nmodern journalism. Prior to 1833 no leading newspaper could throw\r\nsufficient enterprise into its business to raise its circulation above\r\n5000 copies. This kept the price of advertising low, and consequently\r\nlimited a source of profit which has since grown to enormous\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\nThe period ended with the advent of the penny press, in New York, in\r\n1833. The initial experiment in this line was made by H. D. Shepard\r\nwith his “Morning Post,” and it proved a failure in the short period\r\nof three weeks. The next was “The Daily Sun,” September 23, 1833,\r\nclaiming to be “written, edited, set up, and worked off” by Benjamin\r\nFranklin Day. It remained a penny paper for a long time and attained\r\na large circulation. It was reorganized in 1867, when Charles A. Dana\r\nbecame its editor. Though the price was put up to two cents, it became\r\nunder his control one of the most potential news and political factors\r\nof the century, and attained a circulation of over 100,000 copies\r\ndaily. In May, 1835, James Gordon Bennett followed in the tracks of Day\r\nwith “The New York Herald.” Its sprightly news columns and fantastic\r\nadvertisements commended it to popular favor, and proved a source of\r\ngreat profit. It has since greatly varied its prices; but by dint\r\nof stupendous, if peculiar, enterprise, it has grown into enormous\r\ncirculation, and become a property worth millions. In 1841, Horace\r\nGreeley started “The New York Tribune,” at first as a penny paper,\r\nthough on an elevated plane. It soon grew into popular favor, and with\r\nits weekly and semi-weekly editions for country circulation became one\r\nof the most widely circulated and influential journals in the country.\r\n“The New York Times” also began as a penny paper in 1851, under the\r\ncontrol of Henry J. Raymond.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOSEPH MEDILL.\r\n\r\n“Chicago Tribune.”]\r\n\r\nWhile the era of a distinctive and popular penny press was short-lived,\r\nit witnessed one of the most notable advances of the century in\r\njournalism. It stimulated newspaper enterprise throughout the entire\r\ncountry, and journals multiplied enormously. The era practically ended\r\nwith the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, which event caused a rise\r\nin the price of paper, a demand for expensive correspondence, telegraph\r\nnews and battle scenes, and a consequent necessity for enlarged and\r\nquadrupled sheets. Many of the penny papers went up to a five-cent\r\nprice under the stimulus of war excitement, the improved system of\r\ncollecting news, and the added expense of publication. This era of\r\nphenomenal newspaper expansion extended even to the end of the century.\r\nIt has witnessed the wonderful evolution of the newspaper in all its\r\nmodern phases,—the advent of the Sunday newspaper; the growth of the\r\ndaily sheet to mammoth proportions; the incorporation of the Associated\r\nPress, with its thousands of agents in every part of the country\r\ngathering and sending the minutest events of the day; correspondence\r\nfrom every quarter of the globe, and covering every field of activity;\r\na highly improved and more independent editorship; a greatly enlarged,\r\nmore active, and more conscientious reportorial staff; the coming of\r\nthe interviewer, at first an impertinent pest, but now recognized as\r\na valuable journalistic adjunct in reflecting opinions and sentiments\r\nnot otherwise obtainable; the employment of the thousand and one new\r\nappliances for printing, such as stereotyping, electrotyping, improved\r\ntypes, typesetting machines, rapid presses, folding machines, etc.\r\n\r\nBy 1883 a reaction came on in the prices of leading journals, and they\r\nwere forced to reduce them by reason of the strong competition offered\r\nby the numerous and powerful two-cent journals which had come into\r\nbeing and had proven to be valuable properties. Indeed, this reaction\r\ndid not leave the two-cent journals untouched, for it brought many of\r\nthat class to a one-cent basis, with the claim that a consequently\r\nincreased circulation would enhance the profits from advertising.\r\nThis claim is a debatable one, and it may be safely said that most of\r\nthe newspapers established near the end of the century have adopted a\r\ntwo-cent basis as a golden mean between the one-cent and three-cent\r\njournals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RECORD BUILDING, PHILADELPHIA.]\r\n\r\nProportionally speaking, the growth of the press in the United States\r\nhas been as even as it has been rapid. No leading city is without\r\npress establishments and prominent journals, some of them conducted\r\non the largest scales of expenditure,—the West vying with the East,\r\nand the South with the North, in liberality and enterprise. The\r\nnewspaper office of the early part of the century was generally dingy\r\nand cramped. The abode of many, especially in the larger cities, has\r\nbecome a handsome pile, conspicuous in architectural effects, capacious\r\nand cleanly,—fitting hive for the myriad of workers that toil at\r\nmidday and midnight in pursuit of the “art preservative.” The annual\r\nexpenditure of a single newspaper operated on a large scale has been\r\nthus computed: Editorial and literary matter, $220,000; local news,\r\n$290,000; illustrations, $180,000; correspondence, $125,000; telegraph,\r\n$65,000; cable, $27,000; mechanical, $410,500; paper, $617,000;\r\nbusiness office, $219,000; a total of $2,153,500.\r\n\r\nNearly every town in the United States of 15,000 population has come\r\nby the end of the century to have its daily newspaper, and few of even\r\n1000 population, especially if a county-seat, are without their weekly\r\nnewspapers. It has become possible to conduct a rural weekly of fair\r\nproportions and with quite readable matter upon a very economic basis,\r\nby means of a central office in some large city. This office prints\r\nand supplies to the rural offices, of which it may have hundreds on\r\nits list, the two outside pages of a weekly, leaving to the local\r\noffice only the duty of supplying and printing on the inside pages its\r\ndomestic news.\r\n\r\nIn the number of its newspapers and periodicals the United States\r\neasily leads the world. Only approximate figures for the close of the\r\ncentury are at hand; but these, for the United States, gravitate around\r\na total of 20,000 newspapers and periodicals, while those for other\r\ncountries which report are as follows: Great Britain, 4229; France,\r\n4100; Germany, 5500; Austria-Hungary, 3500; Italy, 1400; Spain, 1200;\r\nRussia, 800; Switzerland, 450; Belgium, 300; Holland, 300; Canada, 862.\r\nIn the report of 1894 for United States newspapers and periodicals,\r\nthe following subdivision appears: Dailies, 1853; tri-weeklies, 29;\r\nsemi-weeklies, 223; weeklies, 14,077; bi-weeklies, 62; semi-monthlies,\r\n290; monthlies, 2501; bi-monthlies, 70; quarterlies, 197. The States\r\nin which over one thousand newspapers and periodicals are printed\r\nare, New York, with 2001; Illinois, with 1520; Pennsylvania, with\r\n1408; Ohio, with 1108. The States next in order, and with a number of\r\nnewspapers and periodicals between 500 and 1000, are, Iowa, with 978;\r\nMissouri, with 907; Indiana, with 753; Kansas, with 732; Michigan, with\r\n727; Massachusetts, with 664; Texas, with 656; Nebraska, with 639;\r\nCalifornia, with 637; Wisconsin, with 551; Minnesota, with 549.\r\n\r\nThe century’s newspaper literature in the United States has been\r\nfurther characterized by the introduction of the comic feature. The\r\ncomic newspaper came into being about the middle of the century, but\r\ndid not strike a practical minded people with favor. It was not until\r\nthe century was well rounded out that the cartoonist’s and joker’s art\r\ncame into sufficient demand to make a comic newspaper a commercial\r\nsuccess. Even now their number is limited to a very few that can boast\r\nof permanent success.\r\n\r\nThe daily newspapers of the latter part of the century have not been\r\ndissuaded by earlier attempts to make illustrations a conspicuous\r\nfeature. On the contrary, newspaper illustration has grown to the\r\nproportions of a special art, and all of the larger and better equipped\r\ndailies have organized departments into which are gathered photographs\r\nand engravings ready for reproduction as events demand. So the\r\ncorrespondent and reporter have added to knighthood of the pen that of\r\nthe camera, and the scenic view has become an essential part of serious\r\ncorrespondence and sprightly reporting.\r\n\r\nAn immense, imposing, and highly useful current of literature flows\r\nthrough the magazines, which have, by their number, beauty, and\r\nadaptation, come to be a distinguishing feature of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. This class of literature is usually called “Periodical,” and\r\nit embraces the magazines and reviews devoted to general literature and\r\nscience, the class magazines devoted to particular branches of science,\r\nart, or industry, and the publications of schools and societies. Most\r\nperiodicals published in the English language are monthlies. The same\r\nis true of those published on the continent of Europe, save that there\r\nthe old-fashioned quarterly style is still much affected.\r\n\r\nPeriodical literature found a beginning in France as early as 1665,\r\nin what is still the organ of the French Academy. The first English\r\nperiodical was published in 1680, and was hardly more than a catalogue\r\nof books. The growth of the periodical or magazine proved to be very\r\nslow. Up to 1800, not more than eighty had found mentionable existence\r\nas scientific and technical periodicals, and only three as strictly\r\nliterary periodicals. The advent of “The Edinburgh Review,” in 1802,\r\ngave great impetus to periodical literature in Great Britain, and the\r\nperiod from 1840 to 1850 was one of special development, but to be\r\nsurpassed by that of 1860 to 1870, when the shilling magazine came into\r\nvogue. This class of literature also developed very rapidly in France\r\nduring the century, Paris having 1381 periodicals of all kinds by\r\n1890. There was an equally rapid development in Germany, Austria, and\r\nthroughout the continent.\r\n\r\nThe English magazine found several imitators in the United States\r\nduring the latter part of the eighteenth century, most of which had\r\nbrief existences. Such was the fatality overhanging this class of\r\nenterprise, that until 1810 but twenty-seven periodicals could be\r\ncounted in the United States. While the next forty years were marked\r\nby several magazine successes, such as the “Knickerbocker,” “Graham’s\r\nMagazine,” and “Putnam’s Monthly,” they were, nevertheless, strewn\r\nwith long lines of melancholy wreckage. Indeed, it was not until\r\nthe middle of the century that the demand for magazine literature\r\nbecame sufficiently intense to make investment in it profitable and\r\npermanent. Since then the development has been almost phenomenal,\r\nkeeping even pace with that of the newspaper. At the end of the century\r\nthe number of monthlies published in the United States approximates\r\n2800; and there are over 300 fortnightlies, 56 bi-monthlies, and 192\r\nquarterlies. These cover the vast domains of general literature,\r\nreligion, science, art, and industry, and in many respects vie with\r\nthe newspaper in popularity and influence. Many of them have developed\r\ninto magnificent properties, whose value would appear incomprehensible\r\nto our grandfathers. They employ excellent talent when special topics\r\nare treated, and rise to occasions of war or other excitement through\r\ngraphically written and highly illustrated articles. Indeed, one of\r\ntheir most impressive features is the high degree to which they have\r\ncarried the art of illustration. Toward the close of the century,\r\nperiodical literature has been greatly expanded and popularized by\r\nthe introduction of the cheap magazine. The older and more dignified\r\nperiodicals had not thought of permanent and profitable existence\r\nat a price less than twenty-five to fifty cents a copy; but those\r\nof the younger and ten-cent class, by dint of what seems to be a\r\nnewly discovered enterprise, have found cheapness no barrier to\r\ncommercial success. Within a decade they have duplicated patrons of\r\nmagazine literature by the million, and proven quite as clearly as the\r\nnewspapers have done that we are a nation of readers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RECORDS OF THE PAST\r\n\r\nBY MORRIS JASTROW, JR., PH.D.,\r\n\r\n_Professor of Semitic Languages, University of Pennsylvania_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present century has so many distinguishing features that it is\r\na hazardous undertaking to summarize its achievements. All branches\r\nof science—Philology, History, Mathematics, Medicine, Theology,\r\nand Philosophy—have felt the stimulating influence of a new spirit\r\nthat made its appearance after the French Revolution. New methods of\r\ninvestigation have not only led to profound modification of views\r\nin all departments of science, but have brought about considerable\r\nadditions to the sum of human knowledge. In the domain of natural\r\nscience, the discovery of new principles and of hitherto unknown forces\r\nhas widened the horizon of humanity and created new mental disciplines;\r\nbut while perhaps less conspicuous, because not so directly connected\r\nwith the actual concerns and needs of the present, the fertility\r\nof historical research during this century is not less remarkable.\r\nThe larger area now embraced under the caption “history of mankind”\r\nfurnishes the best proof for the success that has signalized the labors\r\nof scholars—philologists, historians, and explorers—devoted to the\r\nstudy of the past. Ancient history no longer begins with the Greeks\r\nor the Hebrews. Its _certain_ limits have been removed to as remote a\r\ndate as 3000 B. C., while the anthropologist, supplementing the work\r\nof the historian, has furnished a picture in detail of the life led\r\nby man in various quarters of the globe during that indefinite period\r\nwhich preceded the rise of culture in the true sense of the word. This\r\nextension of knowledge in the domain of human history is primarily\r\ndue to the spade of the explorer, though it required the patience\r\nand ingenuity of the philologist and archæologist to interpret the\r\nmaterial furnished in abundance by the soil that happily preserved\r\nthe records of lost empires. Documents in stone, clay, and papyrus\r\nhave been brought forth from their long resting-places to testify to\r\nthe antiquity and splendor of human culture. By the side of written\r\nrecords, monuments of early civilization have been dug up, palaces,\r\nforts, and temples filled with works of art and skill, to confirm by\r\ntheir testimony the story preserved by those who belonged to the age of\r\nwhich they wrote.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “BLACK OBELISK” OF SHALMANESER II., KING OF ASSYRIA.\r\nB. C. 860–824.\r\n\r\n(British Museum.)]\r\n\r\nRESEARCHES IN MESOPOTAMIA.—The archæological researches conducted\r\nduring this century have definitely established the fact that the\r\nearliest civilizations flourished in the Valley of the Euphrates and\r\nin the district of the Nile. Until the beginning of this century,\r\nEgypt, Babylonia, and Assyria were little more than names. The spirit\r\nof skepticism which accompanies the keen desire for investigation\r\nled scholars to question the tales found in classical writers of the\r\ngreat achievements of the Babylonians and Egyptians. At the beginning\r\nof this century scarcely a vestige remained of the cities of ancient\r\nMesopotamia. The site of Nineveh was unknown, and that of Babylon was\r\nin dispute. A profound sensation was created when, in 1842, P. E.\r\nBotta, the French Consul at Mosul, discovered the remains of a palace\r\nbeneath a mound at Khorsabad, some miles to the north of Mosul on\r\nthe east bank of the Tigris. Botta’s discovery marked the beginning\r\nof an activity and exploration in Mesopotamia which continues to the\r\npresent day. At first the excavations were confined to the mounds in\r\nthe north, in which the palaces of the great Assyrian kings, Sargon,\r\nEsarhaddon, Sennacharib and Asurbanibal (or Sardanapalus as he was\r\ncalled by Greek writers) were unearthed, as well as the great sacred\r\nedifices that formed one of the glories of ancient Assyria. The\r\nbuildings exhumed abound in long series of sculptured slabs, on which\r\nare depicted incidents in the campaigns of the kings and in their\r\nprivate life. Historical records on stone and clay furnished the needed\r\ndetails in illustration of the scenes, and lastly, literary remains\r\nin profusion were found, which revealed the intellectual life and\r\nreligious aspirations of the masses and of the secular and religious\r\nleaders. To England and France belongs the glory of these early\r\nexplorations. Through Botta and Sir Austen Henry Layard, the ancient\r\ncities of Nineveh, Calah, and Ashur, were rediscovered. But as the\r\nfield of activity extended to the mounds in the south, in the Valley\r\nof the Euphrates, other countries, notably Germany and the United\r\nStates, joined in the work. The excavation of the remains of the city\r\nof Babylon were first conducted by Sir Henry Rawlinson in 1854, and\r\nmuch work was afterward done by Hormuzd Rassam; but the most notable\r\nachievements of recent years are the excavations conducted by DeSarzec,\r\nunder the auspices of the French Government, at Telloh, from 1881 to\r\n1895, and those of the University of Pennsylvania at Nippur, begun in\r\n1888, and which are still going on.\r\n\r\nThrough these excavations the history of Babylonia has been carried\r\nback to the fourth millenium B. C., and while there are still some\r\nimportant gaps to be filled out, the course of events in Babylonia\r\nand Assyria from this remote period down to the year 587 B. C., when\r\nCyrus the Mede established a new empire on the ruins of Babylonia and\r\nAssyria, is tolerably clear. Hand in hand with the excavations has gone\r\nthe decipherment of the inscriptions found in such abundance beneath\r\nthe mounds. On clay, stone, and metals, rulers inscribed records of\r\ntheir reigns; and added to pictorial illustrations accounts of their\r\nachievements in war as well as in the internal improvements of their\r\nempires. Clay, so readily furnished by the soil, became the ordinary\r\nwriting material both in Babylonia and in Assyria, and in the course\r\nof time an extensive library, embracing hymns and prayers, omens and\r\nportents, epics, myths, legends, and creation stories, arose. In every\r\nimportant centre there gathered around the temples bodies of priests\r\ndevoted to the preservation and the extension of this literature.\r\nAssyrian culture being but an offshoot of the civilization in the\r\nsouth, Assyria reaped the benefit of the literary work accomplished\r\nby the scribes of Babylonia, and the most extensive collection of the\r\nliterary remains of Babylonia has come to us from a library collected\r\nthrough the exertions of Asurbanibal, and discovered in 1849 by Layard\r\nin the ruins of that king’s palace at Nineveh.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “MOABITE STONE.” ABOUT B. C. 850.\r\n\r\n(_Paris, Museum of the Louvre._)\r\n\r\nMonument dedicated to the god Kemôsh by Mesha, king of Moab (2 Kings\r\n3:4 ff.), to record his victory over the Israelites in the days of\r\nAhab, and the restoration of cities and other works which he undertook\r\nby command of his god. The stone, which measures 3 ft. 10 in. × 2\r\nft. × 14⅓ in., and contains 34 lines of inscription in the so-called\r\nPhenician character, was found at Dibân (the Biblical Dibon, Num.\r\n21:30; 32:34, etc.), in the land of Moab, by the German, Rev. F.\r\nKlein, in 1868. Unfortunately, soon afterward it was broken in pieces\r\nby the Arabs, but about two thirds of the fragments were recovered by\r\nthe Frenchman, Clermont-Ganneau, and it is possible to give a nearly\r\ncomplete text of the inscription from the paper impression which was\r\ntaken before the stone was broken.]\r\n\r\nThe basis for the decipherment of the cuneiform inscriptions, as they\r\nare called from the wedge-shaped characters, was laid by George F.\r\nGrotefend early in this century, whose system was further worked out\r\nwith great ingenuity by Edward Hincks, Jules Oppert, and Sir Henry\r\nRawlinson. These pioneers have been succeeded by a large coterie of\r\nscholars in all parts of the world, who are still busy studying the\r\nlarge amount of material now forthcoming for the elucidation of the\r\npast. Not merely have we learned much of the public and official\r\nevents and religious ideas and customs during the period covered by\r\nthe Babylonian and Assyrian Empires, but through thousands of little\r\nclay tablets that formed the legal and commercial archives deposited\r\nfor safe keeping in the temples, an insight into the life of the people\r\nhas been obtained, of their occupation, of their business enterprise\r\nand commercial methods, and of many phases of social life, such as\r\nthe position of women and slaves, of the manner in which marriages\r\nwere contracted and wills drawn up. Perhaps the most characteristic\r\nfeature of the remarkable civilization that arose in the Valley of\r\nthe Euphrates is the domination of the priesthood over all except the\r\npurely political interests of the people. Thus the priests, as scribes,\r\nas judges, as astronomers, as physicians, brought that civilization to\r\nits high degree of excellence, while under their guidance, likewise,\r\nthe religion of the country developed from a crude nature worship to\r\nan approach to a monotheistic conception of the universe. The heir\r\nof the Babylono-Assyrian empire was Persia, which, from the days of\r\nCyrus till the advent of Alexander, swayed the fortunes of the ancient\r\nworld. In all that pertains to art and architecture, Persia remained\r\nlargely dependent upon Babylonia. Extensive excavations conducted at\r\nSusa by Dieulafoy, about ten years ago, and quite recently continued\r\nby M. de Morgan, have proved most successful in revealing the general\r\nnature and interior decoration of the great royal palace at that place.\r\nIn brilliant coloring of the brick tiles which, as in Babylonia,\r\nformed the common building material, the Persians passed beyond the\r\nBabylonians and Assyrians. One of the most interesting rooms in the\r\nLouvre at Paris is that devoted to the exhibition of the colored wall\r\ndecorations from the palace at Susa, representing such various designs\r\nas a procession of archers and a series of lions. The columns still\r\nstanding at Persepolis have long been famous; and it is here likewise\r\nthat the first cuneiform inscriptions were found which, couched in\r\nPersian, Median, and Assyrian, formed the point of departure for the\r\ndecipherment of cuneiform scripts.\r\n\r\nEGYPTIAN RESEARCHES.—The civilization of Egypt rivals in age and\r\ngrandeur that of Babylonia and Assyria. Here, witnesses to the past\r\nthat survived in the shape of obelisks and pyramids gave scholars in\r\nthis century a good start in the work of unraveling the fascinating\r\nnarrative of Egyptian history. Notwithstanding this, our present\r\nknowledge of the history is due largely to the remarkable series of\r\nexcavations which have been conducted in Upper and Lower Egypt since\r\nthe early decades of this century, and which continue with unabated\r\nactivity at the present time. The stimulus to Egyptian research was\r\ngiven by Napoleon in 1798, who, when setting out upon his Egyptian\r\nexpedition, added to his staff a band of scholars entrusted with\r\nthe task of studying and preparing for publication the remains\r\nof antiquity. The result was a monumental work that forms the\r\nfoundation of modern Egyptological studies. Another direct outcome\r\nof the expedition was the discovery of the famous Rosetta stone, in\r\n1799, which, containing a hieroglyphic inscription accompanied by a\r\nGreek translation, served as the basis for a trustworthy system of\r\ndecipherment of the ancient language of the Nile. The Frenchman, Jean\r\nFrançois Champollion, and the Englishman, Dr. Thomas Young, share\r\nthe honor of having found the key that unlocked the mystery of the\r\nhieroglyphic script. As in the case of Babylonian archæology, so here,\r\nexcavations and decipherment went hand in hand. A few years after the\r\nadvent of Botta at Mosul, Mariette inaugurated in Egypt a series of\r\nbrilliant excavations under the auspices of the French government.\r\nAbout the same time the German government sent Richard Lepsius on an\r\nexpedition to Egypt, which resulted in the establishment of a large\r\nEgyptian Museum at Berlin. In 1883 England entered the field through\r\nthe formation of the Egyptian Exploration Fund, and since that time a\r\nlarge number of cities in Lower Egypt, in the Fayum district, and in\r\nUpper Egypt have been unearthed. Year after year W. Flinders Petrie,\r\nEdouard Naville, F. L. Griffith, and others have gone to Egypt and\r\nreturned richly laden with material that has found its way to the\r\nMuseum at Ghizeh, to the British Museum, to Boston, to New York, and\r\nto the Museum of the University of Pennsylvania. The activity of the\r\nFrench was continued after the death of Mariette, through Gaston\r\nMaspero, E. Grebaut, J. DeMorgan and E. Amelineau, so that the mass of\r\nmaterial at present available for Egyptologists is exceedingly large.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUINS OF PHILÆ, OR PHARAOH’S BED, ON AN ISLAND IN THE\r\nNILE.]\r\n\r\nThe cities of Memphis and Thebes have naturally come in for a large\r\nshare of these excavations. Through the texts discovered within the\r\npyramids at Thebes and the surrounding district, the history of the\r\nearly dynasties was for the first time revealed. At Balas and Nagadah,\r\na short distance to the north of Memphis, the excavations have brought\r\nus face to face with the indigenous population of the Nile that\r\nmaintained its primitive customs long after those who founded the real\r\nEgyptian Empire had established themselves in the country. In the\r\ndistrict of the Fayum, notably around Arsinoe, at Hawara, Illahun, and\r\nGurob, traces of early foreign influence—Phœnician and Greek—were\r\ndiscovered, while in Lower Egypt the towns of Naukratis and Tanis\r\nrepresent extensive Greek settlements made in Egypt as early, at least,\r\nas the seventh century B. C. Through the magnificent illustrations in\r\nthe tombs of Beni-Hassan, which have recently been carefully copied by\r\nEnglish artists, almost all phases of ancient Egyptian life have been\r\nrevealed. Though dating from the eleventh and twelfth dynasties,\r\nthe picture that they afford applies to earlier and later periods as\r\nwell. Thus, through the work done in all parts of the ancient empire,\r\nthe links uniting the earliest period to the sway of the Ptolomies and\r\nthe invasion of the Romans have been determined. Wonderful chapters,\r\nreplete with interest, have been added to the history of mankind, and\r\nthough much remains to be done, we are much nearer to a solution than\r\never before of that most important problem as to the origin of the\r\nmysterious Egyptian culture. We know for a certainty that when the\r\nEgyptians came to the region of the Nile, they found a fertile district\r\npopulated by a people, or by groups of people, that had already made\r\nsome progress on the road to civilization, though not yet knowing\r\nthe use of metals. The Asiatic origin of the Egyptians is regarded\r\nas clearly established by so eminent an archæologist as M. DeMorgan,\r\nthough it is likely that his views will be somewhat modified by further\r\nresearch. The infusion of Greek ideas, we now know, begins at a much\r\nearlier age than was formerly supposed, so that it becomes less of a\r\nsurprise to find, even before the advent of Alexander, considerable\r\nportions of Egypt absorbed by foreign settlers.\r\n\r\nA noteworthy feature of archæological work in Egypt during the past\r\ndecade has been the discovery of a vast amount of papyri containing\r\nlong lost portions of Greek literature. The famous work of Aristotle\r\non the Constitution of Athens and the poems of Bacchylides may be\r\nmentioned as the most notable among these discoveries, and the sources\r\nfrom whence these treasures have come seem still far from being\r\nexhausted.\r\n\r\nGREEK RUINS.—The mention of Greek literature leads one naturally\r\nto speak of the work done in this century in that land which stands\r\nso much nearer to us and to modern culture in general than either\r\nBabylonia or Egypt. While, thanks to the activity and industry of Greek\r\nand Roman historians, the records of the inspiring history of the Greek\r\nstates during their most glorious epoch are well preserved, the earlier\r\nperiods were enveloped in doubt and obscurity, while of the remains\r\nof Greece, of her beautiful temples and her famous works of art,\r\ncomparatively few vestiges remained above the soil.\r\n\r\nThe most notable of these were the Parthenon and the Erechtheum, with\r\ntheir works of art, that stood on the Acropolis, and it is precisely\r\nhere that some of the most remarkable archæological discoveries of the\r\ncentury were made. The Parthenon dates from that glorious period in\r\nthe history of Athens which follows in the wake of disasters in the\r\nfifth century, when the Persians entered the city and laid waste its\r\nbeauties. The earlier Athens, which reached its zenith in the days\r\nof Pisistratus, has been brought to light through the excavations\r\nconducted by the Greeks themselves. In 1882 a systematic excavation of\r\nthe Acropolis, under the auspices of the Greek Archæological Society,\r\nwas begun. The foundations of the ancient Temple of Athena that stood\r\nclose to the modern Parthenon were discovered, and numerous works\r\nof art, statues, fragments, pediments, bases and vases, dating from\r\nthe earlier period, by means of which we are enabled to trace the\r\ndevelopment of Athenian sculpture from the rough beginnings to the\r\nperfection that it reached in the days of Phidias. The style of these\r\nearlier works differs totally from that which we had hitherto been\r\naccustomed to regard as the type of Athenian art, and yet even the\r\nrudest of the earlier statues possess already some of that charm which\r\nis so strongly felt in the works of the later period. Most remarkable,\r\nperhaps, among the remains of the earlier Athenians are a large series\r\nof figures that appear to have been set up in rows within the Temple\r\nof Athena. It is through these figures, dating from various periods,\r\nthat we are best able to trace the evolution of Greek art. They are\r\nunquestionably votive offerings, the gift of faithful followers\r\nof Athena, and, while intended probably as representations of the\r\ngoddess herself, but little care was taken to give the goddess those\r\naccompaniments in dress and ornament which are never absent in the best\r\nspecimens of the later period. As a result of these excavations on the\r\nAcropolis, aided by the investigations of numerous scholars, among\r\nwhom Ernst Curtius and William Doerpfeld merit special mention, the\r\nentire plan of the little sacred city that stood on the Acropolis can\r\nnow be traced in detail. The construction of the beautiful Propylæa by\r\nMnesicles, of which remains are still to be seen, has been determined,\r\nand various temples to Athena, worshiped under the different guises\r\nthat she assumed, have been discovered. The place where the great\r\nbronze statue of Athena, one of the master works of Phidias, stood,\r\nhas been fixed, and through the inscriptions found on the Acropolis,\r\nnumerous problems of Greek history have been solved. Every one knows\r\nthe story of the Elgin marbles that once formed the decoration of the\r\nfriezes of the Parthenon, and which in the early part of this century\r\nwere brought to London by Lord Elgin. That act, though frequently\r\ndenounced as a piece of vandalism, has probably done more to arouse\r\nan interest in Greek archæology throughout Europe than anything else.\r\nEven the indignation which Lord Elgin’s act provoked has served a\r\ngood purpose, not only in leading Greece to take better care of her\r\ngreat treasures, but in inducing scholars of England, France, Germany,\r\nand the United States to establish, in Athens, architectural schools\r\nwhere young archæologists may be trained, and where expeditions can be\r\norganized for the systematic investigation of the numerous cities of\r\nancient Greece and the surrounding islands. The most important work\r\ndone through these schools is the excavation of Olympia by the Germans,\r\nand of Delos and of Delphi by the French, while only some degrees\r\nless noticeable is the work done by a zealous Greek, M. Carpanos, at\r\nDodona, by the Greek Society at Eleusis, Epidaurus, and Tanagra, and by\r\nthe American School at Eretria and at Argos. At Olympia the discovery\r\nof the great Temple to Zeus, the grand theatre in which the famous\r\ngames took place, the numerous shrines erected in honor of various\r\ndeities that belong to the court of Zeus, and of hundreds of votive\r\ninscriptions commemorating the victors in the games, have enabled\r\nscholars to restore for us the ancient glories of the place, and to\r\ntrace the history of the sacred city through its period of glory to\r\nits decline and fall. The master work of antiquity, the golden statue\r\nof Zeus made by Phidias, is, alas! forever lost, but it was at Olympia\r\nthat the Germans found the wonderful statue of Hermes by Praxiteles,\r\na find that in itself was worth the million marks spent by the German\r\ngovernment as a tribute to ancient Greece. At Delos and Delphi, the\r\ncareful work done by the French has added to our material for tracing\r\nthe course of Greek religion. Next to Olympia there is, perhaps, no\r\nplace in ancient Greece which had such a strange hold upon the people\r\nas the seat of the great oracle at the foot of Mount Parnassus. The\r\nwork at Delphi is still progressing, but enough has been found to\r\njustify the great reputation of this religious centre in ancient times.\r\nWe can now traverse once again the sacred way leading past numerous\r\nbuildings to the great shrine of Apollo, and to the cave from which the\r\nPythian priestess obtained her inspiration. Fewer works of art have\r\nbeen discovered here than in Olympia, though perhaps the soil still\r\nharbors treasures which the coming years may reveal.\r\n\r\nThe worship of Demeter and the nature of the Eleusinian mysteries are\r\nmuch clearer since the successful excavations that were conducted at\r\nEleusis. Tanagra is of interest because of the clay figurines, the\r\nmanufacture of which was one of the specialties of ancient Bœotia.\r\nThose figures, prepared partly from religious motives, partly as a\r\ntribute to the dead, are valuable as illustrations of popular customs.\r\nGreat credit is due to the American school for the thorough manner in\r\nwhich excavations have been conducted by it, and while the results\r\nare not as striking as in some other places, so fundamental a problem\r\nas the arrangement of the Greek theatre, which has been engaging the\r\nattention of archæologists for the past decade, has been brought nearer\r\nto its solution through excavations at Eretria. At Argos a head of Hera\r\nwas discovered, which is now famous as one of the best specimens of the\r\nPolycletan school.\r\n\r\nNo sketch of Greek archæology, however brief, would be complete without\r\nmention of a man who exhibited singular devotion and rare enthusiasm\r\nfor the study of the past. Heinrich Schliemann, by dint of individual\r\neffort, laid bare the remains of pre-Grecian civilization at Mycenæ and\r\nTiryns, and, prompted by a theory which for a long time provoked naught\r\nbut ridicule, devoted many years and a large fortune to excavations\r\nat Hissarlik, on the coast of Asia Minor, which, he believed, was the\r\nscene of the Trojan War. At the latter place no less than nine cities,\r\nerected one above the ruins of the other, have been found, but the\r\ntheory of Schliemann which identified the second layer with ancient\r\nTroy, afterward known to the Greeks as Ilium, has been shown to be\r\nfalse. It is the sixth layer that represents the ruins of Homer’s Troy.\r\nAt the same time, it must be remembered that the Homeric poems, while\r\nbased upon historic events, are not history, and the attempt to test\r\ntheir supposed historical accuracy by the results of excavations is\r\nnow regarded by Greek students as futile and unscientific. But this\r\nview in no way diminishes the credit due to Schliemann, who not only\r\ndid more to stir up popular interest in ancient Greece than any other\r\nman living, but has illuminated the early chapters of Greek history\r\nwhich were almost unknown to the scholars of this century. It now\r\nappears that Phœnician traders, settling on the coast of Asia Minor\r\nand in districts adjacent to the islands of the Ægean sea and harbors,\r\nwhich furnished a refuge for their ships, gave the first impulse to\r\nGreek art, and, although they were outdistanced by their apt pupils,\r\nthe traces of Phœnician influence remain in Greek architecture, and\r\nmore particularly in Greek cults, down to the latest times. Apart from\r\nthe direct bearings of the excavations conducted in various parts of\r\nGreece upon the development of Greek art, the most important results of\r\nthe work consist in the vast increase of material for Greek history,\r\nwhich is now being rewritten on the basis of the many thousands of\r\ninscriptions that have been found in the great centres of ancient\r\nGreece. As the work of excavation continues, each year brings its\r\nquota of new facts, and it is safe to predict that the recovery of\r\nancient Greece will be noted in future ages as one of the most notable\r\nachievements of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SO-CALLED SARCOPHAGUS OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT IN\r\nMARBLE FROM MOUNT PENTELIKON. ABOUT B. C. 320.\r\n\r\n(Imperial Ottoman Museum, Constantinople.)]\r\n\r\nPHŒNICIAN RUINS.—With Egypt, Babylonia, and Greece we are still far\r\nfrom having exhausted the field covered by archæology in this century.\r\nAt Cyprus much has been done by Löhr, Cesnola, and Ohnefalsch-Richter.\r\nThe cities of Cyprus are interesting as forming a meeting-ground for\r\nsuch various civilizations as Phœnician, Egyptian, Proto-Grecian, and\r\nto a limited extent Babylono-Assyrian. The result is a curious mixture\r\nof art and of equally strange syncretism in religious rites. It is\r\none of the disappointments of scholars that we as yet know so little\r\nof the Phœnicians who played such an important role in history. The\r\ntraces of this people of wanderers and merchants have been found in\r\ntombs and votive inscriptions throughout the lands bordering on the\r\nMediterranean, in Northern Africa, in Southern Spain, in Sicily, Malta,\r\nAsia Minor, Cyprus, Crete, Italy, and even Southern France; but in\r\nPhœnicia itself but few inscriptions have been unearthed, and only\r\nscanty remains of the important cities of Sidon and Tyre, which once\r\nflourished on the coast of the Mediterranean. The fate of these cities,\r\nsubjected in the course of centuries to so many different powers, is\r\na sad one. Almost everything that belonged to a high antiquity has\r\ndisappeared, and such scanty excavations as have been undertaken, the\r\nmost notable of which is that of Um-el-Awamid by the late Ernest Renan,\r\nin 1861, have been of little value. Tombs have been discovered, but\r\nonly few of them belong to the Phœnician period in the proper sense.\r\nThe Sarcophagus of Eshmunazar, king of Sidon, with a long Phœnician\r\ninscription, is however a most notable monument and of great historical\r\nimportance. But the most remarkable find within the limits of ancient\r\nPhœnicia was made a few years ago by Hamdi Bey under the auspices\r\nof the Turkish government. In the necropolis at Sidon a series of\r\nsarcophagi were unearthed which, belonging to the Greek period, are\r\nvaluable as furnishing a specimen of the art of Greece transplanted in\r\nforeign soil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRONT VIEW.\r\n\r\nREAR VIEW.\r\n\r\nCUNEIFORM LETTER FROM LACHISH, PALESTINE. ABOUT B. C. 1400.\r\n\r\n(Imperial Ottoman Museum, Constantinople.)]\r\n\r\nRESEARCHES IN PALESTINE.—Ancient Palestine, likewise, so full of\r\nsacred recollections for millions, has been chary of yielding up the\r\ntreasures which there is every reason to believe still lie somewhere\r\nbeneath the soil. In 1870, a stone was found in the land of Moab\r\nwhich commemorated the victory of King Mesha over Israel, about 800\r\nB. C., and forms one of the most valuable monuments for tracing the\r\nhistory of the Phœnician alphabet, of which the one we use is a direct\r\nsuccessor. At Jerusalem a single inscription, belonging probably to\r\nthe age of Hezekiah, was found by accident at the pool of Siloam.\r\nThis paucity of archæological returns is not due to any lack of\r\ninterest in recovering the monuments of ancient Palestine. In Germany\r\nand England, societies for the exploration of Palestine have been in\r\nexistence for the past twenty years, and much important work has been\r\ndone by them in making careful surveys of the country, in identifying\r\nancient sites, and in adding material to our knowledge of the geography\r\nof the country. The combined opposition of fanatical Turks, Arabs,\r\nChristians, and Jews has prevented, until recently, the undertaking of\r\nexcavations in the important centres of the country, such as Jerusalem,\r\nSamaria, Bethlehem, Hebron, and the like. A few years ago the mound\r\nTel-el-Hesy, covering the site of the ancient city of Lachish, was\r\nthoroughly explored by F. J. Bliss, and no less than ten layers of\r\ncities identified by him; but the results, except for some pottery and\r\na most important discovery of a cuneiform tablet which belongs to the\r\nEl-Amarna series and dates from the fifteenth century B. C., have been\r\nrather disappointing. Recently Mr. Bliss has succeeded in obtaining\r\npermission to undertake excavations at Jerusalem. He has begun his work\r\nby tracing carefully the walls of the ancient city, but until this work\r\nis pushed to the extent of actually digging down some forty feet below\r\nthe level of the present Jerusalem, it is not likely that significant\r\ndiscoveries will be made. There are good reasons for hoping that the\r\ntime is not far distant when systematic work, such as has been done in\r\nEgypt, Babylonia, and Greece, will also be undertaken in Palestine.\r\nWhen that time does come, we may expect that many of the problems\r\nbesetting students of the Old and New Testaments will find their\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARCH OF TITUS, ROME.]\r\n\r\nHITTITE REMAINS.—Archæology does not only solve problems, but\r\nfrequently raises new ones. Such a new problem is that of the Hittites.\r\nDuring the past fifteen years, a large series of monuments, many of\r\nthem sculptured on rocks, have been found in various parts of Asia\r\nMinor, from the district of Lake Van almost to the Mediterranean\r\ncoast, and notably at Hamath, on the Orontes. They all betray the\r\nsame art, and are accompanied by inscriptions in characters to which\r\nthe name Hittite has been given. It is to be borne in mind that this\r\nterm Hittite is to a large extent a conventional one, covering a\r\nseries of peoples that may have belonged to different races. We hear\r\nof these Hittites in the Asiatic campaigns of Egyptian kings from the\r\nseventeenth century B. C. down to 1400 B. C. Establishing an empire\r\non the Orontes, they gave the Assyrians a great deal of trouble, and\r\nit was not until the end of the eighth century that they were finally\r\nconquered. Though we know a good deal of the history of these Hittites\r\nfrom the records of Egyptians, Babylonians, and Assyrians, their origin\r\nremains wrapped in obscurity. The Hittite characters have not yet been\r\ndeciphered, although various attempts of interpreters have been made.\r\nThe last of these is that of Professor Peter Jensen, of the University\r\nof Marburg, who believes that the Hittite language is a prototype of\r\nthe modern Armenian. Although a number of prominent scholars have\r\nacknowledged their acceptance of the Jensen system, it cannot be said\r\nas yet to have been definitely established, nor is it likely that a\r\nsatisfactory key will be found until a large bilingual inscription\r\ncontaining a record in Hittite characters with a translation,\r\nperhaps, in Assyrian or Aramaic, shall have been found. Such a find\r\nmay be expected at any moment. Meanwhile, it may be said that from\r\nan ethnological point of view, it seems more plausible to regard the\r\nHittites as a part of the Turanian stock rather than belonging to the\r\nAryan or Semitic races. The exploration of India, China, and Japan\r\ncan scarcely be said to have more than begun. The notable series\r\nof inscriptions that recall the period of Indian history connected\r\nwith Acoka may be regarded as a specimen of what we may expect when\r\nonce those distant lands are as thoroughly explored as the countries\r\nsituated around the Mediterranean sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HITTITE INSCRIPTION FROM JERABIS.]\r\n\r\nROMAN RUINS.—Coming to the last and greatest of the empires of\r\nantiquity, Rome, a word should be said about the activity that has\r\ncharacterized the excavations at Herculaneum and Pompeii, and recently\r\nin the city of Rome, which are carried on so successfully by Rudolfo\r\nLanciani. While our knowledge of Roman history has always been much\r\nmore complete than that of Greece, still many questions of detail\r\nhave only recently been settled through these excavations. An insight\r\nhas been afforded into the public and private life of the Romans\r\nwhich supplements that which was to be gained from the study of the\r\nclassical writers. Europe and America have also been seized with the\r\narchæological fever. In Germany, Austria, France, Sweden, Denmark,\r\nHolland, Switzerland, North America, and South America, the knowledge\r\nof the past has been extended through exploration and excavation. So\r\nlarge is the field of archæology at present, that it is impossible for\r\none person to make himself familiar with more than a small section;\r\nbut, on the other hand, so close is the sympathy between the various\r\nbranches of mankind scattered throughout the world that there is\r\nno work carried on in one division of archæology which has not its\r\nbearings upon many others. What Goethe said of human life may be said\r\nof archæology: “Wo ihr’s packt, da ist’s interessant.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGRESS IN DAIRY FARMING\r\n\r\nBY MAJOR HENRY E. ALVORD, C.E., LL.D.,\r\n\r\n_Chief of Dairy Division, U. S. Department of Agriculture_.\r\n\r\n\r\nNearly all industries have their branches or specialties. Farming is\r\nno exception, and one of the most interesting, highly developed, and\r\nremunerative of its branches is dairying. To be successful, dairying\r\nrequires good judgment, knowledge of the relations of modern science to\r\nagricultural production, constant study, system, and close attention\r\nto details. Hence it is regarded as among the highest forms of\r\nfarming. The occupation is itself so stimulating and the rewards are\r\nso substantial, when brains and brawn are applied to it in judicious\r\ncombination, that dairying districts are commonly conspicuous as the\r\nmost enterprising, prosperous, and contented of the rural communities\r\nof their section of country.\r\n\r\nIn all lines of farming at least one “money crop” seems to be the aim,\r\nalthough this term may include animals and animal products. A great\r\ndisadvantage in certain kinds of farming is that the returns come\r\nat long intervals, perhaps but once a year, while the expenses are\r\ncontinuous for twelve months. Dairying, as conducted by modern methods,\r\ndistributes the farm income through the year; the cash returns are\r\nmonthly, or oftener, the pernicious credit system disappears, money\r\ncirculates, and at all seasons a healthy business activity prevails in\r\nthe whole community.\r\n\r\nIt is a noteworthy fact, that during periods of agricultural depression\r\nexperienced in the United States during the nineteenth century, the\r\nproducts of the dairy have maintained relative values above all other\r\nfarm products, and dairy districts seem to have passed through these\r\nperiods with less distress than most others.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of this country, geographically, being well adapted\r\nto dairying, this branch of agriculture has always been prominent\r\nin America, and its extension has kept pace with the opening and\r\nsettlement of new territory. For many years a belief existed that\r\nsuccessful dairying in the United States must be restricted to narrow\r\ngeographical limits, constituting a “dairy belt” lying between the\r\nfortieth and forty-fifth degrees of latitude, and extending from the\r\nAtlantic Ocean to the Missouri River; and the true dairying districts\r\nwere felt to be in separated sections occupying not more than one third\r\nof the area of this belt. These ideas have been exploded. It has been\r\nshown that good butter and cheese can, by proper management, be made\r\nin almost all parts of North America. Generally speaking, good butter\r\ncan be profitably produced wherever good beef can. Decided advantages\r\nunquestionably exist, in the climate, soil, water, and herbage of\r\ncertain sections; but these influences are largely under control, and\r\nwhat is lacking in natural conditions can be supplied by tact and\r\nskill. So that, while dairying is intensified and constitutes the\r\nleading agricultural industry over wide areas, including whole States,\r\nwhere the natural advantages are greatest, the industry is found well\r\nestablished in spots in almost all parts of the country, and is\r\ndeveloping in unexpected places, and under what might be considered as\r\nvery unfavorable conditions.\r\n\r\nDairying existed in colonial times in America, and butter and cheese\r\nare mentioned among the early exports from the settlements along the\r\nAtlantic coast. But this production was only incident to general\r\nfarming. Dairying, as a specialty in the United States, did not appear\r\nto any extent until well along in the nineteenth century. The history\r\nof this industry in this country is therefore identical with its\r\nprogress in that century. This progress has been truly remarkable. The\r\nwide territorial extension, the immense investment in lands, buildings,\r\nanimals, and equipment, the great improvement in dairy cattle, the\r\nacquisition and diffusion of knowledge as to economy of production, the\r\nrevolution in methods and systems of manufacture, the general advance\r\nin quality of products, the wonderful increase in quantity, and the\r\nindustrial and commercial importance of the industry, have kept pace\r\nwith the general material progress of the nation and constitute one of\r\nits leading features.\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of the century, the keeping of cows on American\r\nfarms was incident to the general work, the care of milk and the\r\nmaking of butter and cheese were in the hands of the women of the\r\nhousehold, the methods and utensils were crude, the average quality\r\nof the products was inferior, and the supply of our domestic markets\r\nwas unorganized and irregular. The milch cows in use belonged to the\r\nmixed and indescribable herd of “native” cattle, with really good dairy\r\nanimals appearing singly, almost by accident, or, at the best, in a\r\nfamily developed by some uncommonly discriminating yet unscientific\r\nbreeder. The cows calved almost universally in the spring, and were\r\ngenerally allowed to go dry in the autumn or early winter. Winter\r\ndairying was practically unknown. As a rule, excepting the pasture\r\nseason, cattle were insufficiently, and therefore unprofitably, fed\r\nand poorly housed. In the Eastern and Northern States, the milk was\r\nusually set in small shallow earthen vessels or tin pans, for the\r\ncream to rise. Little attention was paid to cooling the air in which\r\nit stood in summer, or to moderating it in winter, so long as freezing\r\nwas prevented. The pans of milk oftener stood in pantries and cellars\r\nthan in milk rooms specially constructed or prepared. In Pennsylvania\r\nand the States farther south, where spring-houses were in vogue,\r\nmilk received better care, and setting it in earthen crocks or pots,\r\nstanding in cool, flowing water, was a usual and excellent practice.\r\nChurning the entire milk was very common. Excepting the comparatively\r\nfew instances where families were supplied with butter weekly, and\r\noccasionally a cheese, direct from the producers, the farm practice was\r\nto “pack” the butter in firkins, half-firkins, tubs, and jars, and let\r\nthe cheese accumulate on the farms, taking these products to market\r\nonly once or twice a year. Not only were there as many different lots\r\nand kinds of butter and cheese as there were producing farms, but the\r\nproduct of a single farm varied in character and quality, according\r\nto season and other circumstances. Every package had to be examined,\r\ngraded, and sold upon its merits. Prices were low.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A TYPICAL DAIRY FARM.]\r\n\r\nThese conditions continued, without material change, up to the\r\nmiddle of the century. Some improvement was noticeable in cattle and\r\nappliances, and in some sections dairy farming became a specialty. With\r\nthe growth of towns and cities, the business of milk supply increased\r\nand better methods prevailed. Butter-making for home use and local\r\ntrade, in a small way, was common wherever cows were kept, and in some\r\nplaces there was a surplus sufficient to be sent to the large markets.\r\nVermont and New York became known as butter producing States. “Franklin\r\nCounty butter,” from counties of this name in New York, Vermont, and\r\nMassachusetts, was known throughout New England, and the fame of\r\n“Orange County” and “Goshen” butter, from New York, was still more\r\nextensive. New York, Ohio, and Northern Pennsylvania produced large\r\nquantities of cheese; and the total supply was so much in excess of\r\ndomestic demand, that cheese exports from the United States, mainly to\r\nGreat Britain, became established, and ranged from three to seventeen\r\nmillion pounds a year.\r\n\r\nThe twenty-five years following 1850 was a period of remarkable\r\nactivity and progress in the dairy interests of the country. At first,\r\nthe agricultural exhibitions or “cattle shows,” and the enterprise\r\nof importers, turned attention towards the improvement of farm\r\nanimals, and breeds of cattle specially noted for dairy qualities were\r\nintroduced and began to win the favor of dairymen. Then the early\r\nefforts at coöperative dairying were recognized as successful, and were\r\ncopied until the cheese factory became an established institution. Once\r\nfairly started, in the heart of the great cheese-making district of New\r\nYork, the factory system spread with much rapidity. The “war period”\r\nlent additional impetus to the forward movement. The foreign demand\r\nfor cheese grew fast, and the price, which was ten cents per pound and\r\nless in 1860, rose to fifteen cents in 1863, and to twenty cents and\r\nover in 1865. There were two cheese factories in Oneida County in 1854,\r\nand twenty-five in 1862. The system spread to Herkimer and adjoining\r\ncounties, and in 1863 there were 100 factories in New York, besides\r\nsome in Ohio and other States. The number increased to 300 in the whole\r\ncountry in 1865, to 600 in two years more, and to over 1000 in 1869.\r\nFrom that time the coöperative or factory system practically superseded\r\nthe manufacture of cheese on farms. Establishments for the making of\r\nbutter in quantity, from the milk or cream collected from numerous\r\nfarms, soon followed the cheese factories. Such are properly butter\r\nfactories, but the name of “creamery” has come into general use for an\r\nestablishment of this kind, and seems unlikely to change. Placing the\r\nreal beginning of cheese factories as a system of dairying in 1861 or\r\n1862, the first creamery was started in 1861, in Orange County, New\r\nYork. In Illinois, the first cheese factory was built in 1863, and the\r\nfirst creamery in 1867; in Iowa, the respective dates were 1866 and\r\n1871.\r\n\r\nThe effect of these industrial establishments, comparatively new in\r\nkind, is to transfer the making of butter and cheese from the farm to\r\nthe factory. Originating in this country, although now extensively\r\nadopted in others, the general plan may be called the American system\r\nof associated dairying. The early cheese-factories and creameries were\r\npurely coöperative concerns, and it is in this form that the system\r\nhas usually extended into new territory, whether for the production\r\nof butter or cheese. The cow owners and producers of milk coöperate\r\nand share, upon any agreed basis, in organizing, building (perhaps),\r\nequipping, and managing the factory and disposing of its products.\r\nAnother plan is for the plant to be owned by a joint-stock company,\r\ncomposed largely, if not wholly, of farmers, and milk or cream is\r\nreceived from any satisfactory producer; the factory may be allowed a\r\ncertain rate of interest on the investment, or may charge a fixed price\r\nper pound for making butter or cheese, and then divide the remaining\r\nproceeds _pro rata_ according to the raw material supplied by its\r\n“patrons.” The proprietary plan is also common, being managed much like\r\nany other factory, the proprietor or company buying the milk or cream\r\nfrom the producers, at prices mutually agreed upon from time to time.\r\nAnd all these plans have their variations and modifications in practice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MODERN CREAMERY AND CHEESE FACTORY, WITH ICE-HOUSE, ETC.]\r\n\r\nThe third quarter of a century was also a period of unprecedented\r\nprogress in the application of mechanics to the dairy. The factories\r\nand creameries required new equipment, adapted to manufacture upon an\r\nenlarged scale, and equal attention was paid to the improvement of\r\nappliances for farm dairies. The system for setting milk for creaming\r\nin deep cans in cold water—preferably ice-water—was introduced\r\nfrom Sweden, although the same principles had been in practice for\r\ngenerations in the spring-houses of the South. Numerous creaming\r\nappliances, or creamers, were invented, based upon this system. Shallow\r\npans were changed in size and shape, and then almost disappeared.\r\nButter workers of various models took the place of bowl and ladle and\r\nthe use of the bare hand. Churns appeared, of all shapes, sizes, and\r\nkinds, the general movement being towards the abolition of dashers\r\nand the substitution of agitation of cream for violent beating. About\r\nthis time the writer made a search of the United States Patent Office\r\nrecords, which revealed the fact that forty or fifty new or improved\r\nchurns were claimed annually, and after rejecting about one fourth, the\r\npatents actually issued provided a new churn every fifteen days for\r\nmore than seventy years. This illustrates the activity of invention in\r\nthis line. It was admitted by all that at this period the United States\r\nwas far in advance of any other country in the variety and excellence\r\nof its mechanical aids to dairying.\r\n\r\nThe same period witnessed the organization of dairymen in voluntary\r\nassociations for mutual benefit in several States, the formation of\r\nclubs and societies of breeders of pure-bred cattle, and the appearance\r\nof the first American dairy literature of consequence in book form.\r\nThe American Dairymen’s Association was organized in 1803. Its field\r\nof activity was east of Indiana, and accordingly the Northwestern\r\nDairymen’s Association was formed in 1867. Both of these continued in\r\nexistence, held periodical meetings, and published their proceedings\r\nfor twelve or fifteen years. Then the formation of State dairy\r\nassociations in Vermont (1870), Pennsylvania (1871), New York (1877),\r\nWisconsin (1872), Illinois (1874), Iowa (1870), and other States took\r\nthe place of the pioneer societies which covered wider territory.\r\n\r\nThe Short-horn breed led in the introduction of improved cattle to\r\nthe United States, and for a long time the representatives of this\r\nrace, imported from England, embraced fine dairy animals. Short-horn\r\ngrades formed the foundation, and a very good one, upon which many\r\ndairy herds were built up during the second and third quarters of the\r\ncentury, and much of this blood is still found in prosperous dairying\r\ndistricts. This was the period of greatest activity in importing\r\nimproved cattle from abroad. But Short-horns have been so generally\r\nbred for beef qualities that the demand for them is almost exclusively\r\non that line, and they are no longer classed as dairy cattle. Ayrshires\r\nfrom Scotland, Holstein-Friesians from North Holland, and Jerseys\r\nand Guernseys from the Channel Islands, are the breeds recognized as\r\nof dairy excellence, and upon which the industry mainly depends for\r\nimprovement of its milch cows. The first two named are noted for giving\r\nlarge quantities of milk of medium quality; the other two breeds, both\r\noften miscalled “Alderney,” give milk of exceeding richness, and are\r\nthe favorites with butter makers. There are also the Brown Swiss and\r\nSimmenthal cattle from Switzerland, the Normandy breed from France,\r\nand Red Polled cattle from the south of England, which have dairy\r\nmerit, but belong rather to what is called the “general purpose” class.\r\nAssociations of persons interested in maintaining the purity of all the\r\ndifferent breeds named have been formed since 1850, and they all record\r\npedigrees and publish registers or herd-books. Pure-bred herds of some\r\nof these different breeds are owned in nearly all parts of the country,\r\nand half-breeds or higher grades are found wherever cows are kept for\r\ndairy purposes. The quality and production of the average dairy cow in\r\nAmerica are thus being steadily advanced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A TYPICAL DAIRY COW—AYRSHIRE.]\r\n\r\nThe development of dairying in the United States during the closing\r\ndecades of the nineteenth century has been uninterrupted, and\r\nmarked by events of the greatest consequence in the entire history.\r\nThe importance of two inventions during this period cannot be\r\noverestimated. The first is the application of centrifugal force to the\r\nseparation of cream from milk. This is based upon the specific gravity\r\nof the milk serum or skim milk, and of whatever impure matter may have\r\nentered the milk, such gravity being greater than that of the fatty\r\nportion or cream. The dairy centrifuge, or cream separator, enables the\r\ncreaming or “skimming” to be done immediately after milking, preferably\r\nwhile the milk is still warm. The cream can be at once churned, while\r\nsweet; but a better practice is to cure or “ripen” it for churning:\r\nthis can be done at a comparatively high temperature, dispensing with\r\nthe necessity of so much ice or cold water. The skim milk is available\r\nfor use while still warm, quite sweet, and in its best condition for\r\nfeeding to young animals. This mechanical method is more efficient,\r\nsecuring more perfect cream separation than the old gravity system, and\r\nthe dairy labor is very largely reduced. The handling and caring for\r\nthe milk may be thus wholly removed from the duties of the household.\r\nA usual plan is to have a “skimming station,” to which the milk is\r\nhauled at least daily from the producing farms in the vicinity, and\r\nwhere one or more separators are operated by power. Separators are\r\nalso made of sizes and patterns suited to farm use, where they may\r\nbe operated by hand or by light power,—electricity, steam, water, a\r\nhorse, a bull, a sheep, or a dog. Besides its economy and its effect\r\nupon labor, this machine almost eliminates the factor of climate in a\r\nlarge part of dairy management, and altogether has worked a revolution\r\nin the industry. The centrifugal separator is still a marvel to those\r\nwho see it working for the first time: the whole milk, warm, flows\r\ninto the centre of a strong steel bowl, held in an iron frame; the\r\nbowl revolves at a rate of 1500 to 25,000 times per minute, and from\r\ntwo projecting tubes cream and skim milk flow in continuous streams to\r\nseparate receptacles. The machines can be regulated to produce cream\r\nof any desired thickness or quality. These separators, of different\r\nsizes, are capable of thus skimming or separating, or more properly,\r\ncreaming, from 15 to 500 gallons of milk per hour. A machine of\r\nstandard factory size has a speed of 6000 to 7000 revolutions a minute,\r\nand a capacity for separating 250 gallons of milk an hour. The world is\r\nindebted to Europe for this invention, at least as a dairy appliance.\r\nYet investigations were in progress contemporaneously in this country\r\nalong the same line, and many of the material improvements in the cream\r\nseparator and several entirely new patterns have since been invented\r\nhere. The first separators were put into practical use in this country\r\nand Great Britain in the year 1879. The century closes with 35,000 to\r\n40,000 of these machines in operation in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe second great dairy invention of the period is the fat-test for\r\nmilk,—being a quick and easy substitute for chemical analysis. This is\r\none of the public benefactions of the Agricultural Experiment Stations\r\nwhich, under State and national endowment, have been established during\r\nthe last part of the century, so that there is now at least one in\r\nevery State. A number of these have done much creditable work in dairy\r\ninvestigation, and from them have come several clever methods for\r\ntesting the fat content of milk. The method which has been generally\r\napproved and is now almost universally adopted in this and other lands\r\nis named for its originator, Dr. S. M. Babcock, the able chemist and\r\ndairy investigator, first of the New York Station at Geneva and since\r\nof the Wisconsin Station at Madison. This tester combines the principle\r\nof centrifugal force with simple chemical action. The machine, on the\r\nBabcock plan, has been made in a great variety of patterns, simple\r\nand inexpensive for home use, more elaborate and substantial for\r\nfactories. By them from two to forty samples of milk may be tested at\r\nonce in a few moments; and by slight modifications in the appliances,\r\nthe fat may be determined in samples of milk, cream, skim-milk, or\r\nbutter-milk. This fat test of milk has wide application, and is second\r\nonly to the separator in advancing the economies of dairying. The\r\npercentage of fat being accepted as the measure of value for milk for\r\nnearly all purposes, the Babcock test may be the basis for city milk\r\ninspection, for fixing the price of milk delivered to city dealers, to\r\ncheese factories and creameries, and for commercial settlements between\r\npatrons in coöperative dairying of any kind. By this test, also, the\r\ndairyman may prove the quality of milk from his different cows, and\r\n(with quantity of milk-yield recorded) may fix their respective value\r\nas dairy animals. With perfect apparatus in careful hands, the accuracy\r\nof the test is unquestioned, and it is of the highest scientific value.\r\nIt should be noted that although clearly patentable, and offering an\r\nindependence through a very small royalty, this priceless invention and\r\nboon to dairying was freely given to the public by Dr. Babcock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CENTRIFUGAL CREAM SEPARATOR IN OPERATION.]\r\n\r\nThe advent of the twentieth century finds the dairy industry of the\r\nUnited States established upon a plane far above the simple and\r\ncrude domestic art of three or four generations ago. The milch cow\r\nitself, upon which the whole business rests, is more of a machine\r\nthan a natural product. The animal has been so bred and developed to\r\na special purpose, that instead of the former short milking period,\r\nalmost limited to the pasture season, it yields a comparatively even\r\nflow of milk during ten or eleven months in every twelve; and if\r\ndesired, the herd produces as much in winter as in summer. It is not\r\nunusual for cows to give ten or twelve times their own weight of milk\r\nduring a year. And the quality has been so improved that the milk of\r\nmany a good dairy cow will produce as much butter in a week as could\r\nbe made from three or four average cows of the olden time. Instead\r\nof a few homely and inconvenient implements for use in the laborious\r\nduties of the dairy, generally devolving upon the women of the farm,\r\nperfected appliances skillfully devised to accomplish their object and\r\nlighten labor are provided all along the way. The factory system of\r\ncoöperative or concentrated manufacture has so far taken the place of\r\nhome dairying, that in entire States the cheese vat or press is as rare\r\nas the hand-loom, and in many counties it is as hard to find a farm\r\nchurn as a spinning-wheel. Long rows of shining tin pans are no longer\r\nseen adorning rural dooryards, as one drives along country roads; but\r\nin their place may be found the bright faces of “the women-folks,” who\r\nrejoice over the revolution of modern dairying.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MILK TESTER (OPEN).]\r\n\r\nHere is an example of this radical change in the system of making\r\nbutter: Northern Vermont has always been a region of large butter\r\nproduction. St. Albans, in Franklin County, is the natural business\r\ncentre. During the middle of the century the country-made butter came\r\nto this town to market every Tuesday from miles around. The average\r\nweekly supply was 30 to 40 tons. This was very varied in quality,\r\nwas sampled and classified with much labor and expense, placed in\r\nthree grades—prime, fair, and poor—and forwarded to the Boston\r\nmarket, two hundred miles distant. During twenty-five years ending\r\nin 1875, 65,000,000 lbs., valued at $20,000,000, passed through this\r\nlittle town. All of this was dairy butter made upon a thousand or two\r\ndifferent farms, in as many churns. In 1881, the first creamery was\r\nbuilt in this county. Now, the Franklin County Creamery Company,\r\nlocated at St. Albans, has fifty-odd skimming stations distributed\r\nthrough this and adjoining counties. To them is carried the milk from\r\n30,000 cows or more, and the separated cream is sent by rail to the\r\ncentral factory, where from ten to twelve tons of butter are made every\r\nday. A single churning room for the whole county! All of this butter\r\nis of standard quality, and sold on its reputation upon orders from\r\ndistant points received in advance of its manufacture. The price is\r\nrelatively higher than the average for the product of the same farms\r\nfifty years ago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BUTTER-MAKING ON THE FARM—THE OLD WAY.]\r\n\r\nIn one respect dairy labor is the same as a hundred years ago. Cows\r\nstill have to be milked by hand. Although numerous attempts have been\r\nmade, and patent after patent issued, no mechanical contrivance has yet\r\nbeen a practical success as a substitute for the human hand in milking.\r\nTherefore, twice a day, every day in the year, the dairy cows must be\r\nmilked. This is one of the main items of labor in the dairy, as well\r\nas a most delicate and important duty. Allowing ten cows per hour to a\r\nmilker,—which is pretty lively work,—it requires the continuous labor\r\nof an army of 300,000 men, working ten or twelve hours a day throughout\r\nthe year, to milk the cows of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe industry is becoming thoroughly organized. Besides local clubs,\r\nsocieties, and unions, there are dairy associations in thirty States,\r\nmost of them incorporated and receiving financial aid under State laws.\r\nIn some States, the butter makers and cheese makers are separately\r\norganized. Sixteen States provide by law for officials known as Dairy\r\nCommissioners or Dairy and Food Commissions. These officers have a\r\nnational association, and there are also two national organizations\r\nof dairymen. At various large markets and centres of activity in the\r\ncommerce of the dairy, there are special boards of trade. The United\r\nStates Department of Agriculture has a Dairy Division, intended to\r\nwatch over and promote the dairy interests of the country at large.\r\nDairy schools are maintained in several States, offering special\r\ncourses of practical and scientific instruction in all branches of\r\nthe business. These schools and the agricultural experiment stations,\r\nwith which most of them are closely connected, are doing much original\r\nresearch and adding to the store of useful information as to the\r\napplications of modern science to the improvement of dairy methods\r\nand results. Weekly and monthly journals, in the interest of dairy\r\nproduction and trade, are published in various parts of the country.\r\nAnd during the last decade or two a number of noteworthy books on\r\ndifferent aspects of dairying have been published, so that the student\r\nof this subject may fill a good-sized case with substantial volumes,\r\ntechnical and practical in character.\r\n\r\nThe business of producing milk for town and city supply, with the\r\naccompanying agencies for transportation and distribution, has grown\r\nto immense proportions. In many places the milk trade is regulated and\r\nsupervised by excellent municipal ordinances, which have done much to\r\nprevent adulteration and improve the average quality of the supply.\r\nFull as much is being done by private enterprise, through large milk\r\ncompanies, well organized and equipped, and establishments which make\r\na specialty of serving milk and cream of fixed quality and exceptional\r\npurity. This branch of dairying is advancing very fast, and upon\r\nthe substantial basis of care, cleanliness, and improved sanitary\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nCheese-making has been transferred bodily from the realm of domestic\r\narts to that of manufactures. Farm-made cheeses are hard to find\r\nanywhere, are used only locally, and make no impression upon the\r\nmarkets. In the middle of the century about 100,000,000 pounds of\r\ncheese were made yearly in the United States, all of it on farms. At\r\nthe close of the century the annual production of the country is about\r\n300,000,000 pounds, and 96 or 97 per cent of this is made in factories.\r\nOf these establishments there are some 3000, varying greatly in\r\ncapacity. New York and Wisconsin each have over a thousand; the former\r\nState makes nearly twice as much cheese as the latter, and the two\r\ntogether produce three fourths of the entire output of this country.\r\nThe other cheese-making States, in the order of quantity produced, are\r\nOhio, Illinois, Michigan, and Pennsylvania; but all are comparatively\r\nunimportant. More than nine tenths of all made is of the familiar\r\nstandard variety copied after the English Cheddar, but new kinds and\r\nimitations of foreign varieties are increasing. The cheese made in\r\nthe country, with the small importations added, gives an allowance of\r\nless than four pounds a year to every person; but as thirty to fifty\r\nmillion pounds are still annually exported, the per capita consumption\r\nof cheese in the United States does not exceed three and a half pounds.\r\nThis is a very low rate, much less than in most European countries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BUTTER-MAKING—THE NEW WAY.]\r\n\r\nGreat as has been the growth of the factory system of butter-making,\r\nand fast as creameries are multiplying, especially in the newer and\r\ngrowing agricultural States, such as Minnesota, Nebraska, Kansas,\r\nand South Dakota, there is still much more butter made on farms in\r\nthe United States than in creameries. Creamery butter controls all\r\nthe large markets, the dairy product making comparatively little\r\nimpression on the trade. But home consumption and the supply of small\r\ncustomers and local markets make an immense aggregate, being fully two\r\nthirds of all. Estimating the annual butter product of the country at\r\n1,400,000,000 pounds, not much over 400,000,000 of this is made in\r\nthe 8000 or 9000 creameries now in operation. Iowa is the greatest\r\nbutter producing State, and the one in which the greatest proportion\r\nis made on the factory plan. This State has 850 creameries, only three\r\ncounties being without them; about two fifths are coöperative. In\r\nthese creameries about 90,000,000 pounds of butter are made annually\r\nfrom 750,000 cows. It is estimated that in the same State 50,000,000\r\npounds of butter in addition are made in farm dairies. The total butter\r\nproduct of the State is therefore one tenth of all made in the Union.\r\nIowa sends over 80,000,000 pounds of butter every year to other States.\r\nNew York is next in importance as a butter-making State, and then\r\ncome Pennsylvania, Illinois, Wisconsin, Ohio, Minnesota, and Kansas.\r\nYet all these combined make but little more than half of the annual\r\nbutter crop of the United States, and in no one of them, except Iowa,\r\nis half of the butter produced made in creameries. The average quality\r\nof butter in America has materially improved since the introduction\r\nof the creamery system and the use of modern appliances. No butter\r\nis imported, and the quantity exported is as yet insignificant.\r\nConsequently the home consumption must be at the yearly rate of twenty\r\npounds the person, or about one hundred lbs. annually to the family of\r\naverage size. If approximately correct, this shows Americans to be the\r\ngreatest butter-eating people of the world.\r\n\r\nAnd the people of this country also consume millions of pounds every\r\nyear of butter substitutes and imitations, known as oleomargarine,\r\nbutterine, etc. Most of this is believed to be butter by those who use\r\nit, and the State Dairy Commissioners mentioned are largely occupied in\r\nthe execution of laws intended to protect consumers from these butter\r\nfrauds.\r\n\r\nThe cows in the United States were not counted until 1840, but they\r\nhave been enumerated for every decennial census since. It has required\r\nfrom 23 to 27 cows to every 100 of the inhabitants to keep the country\r\nsupplied with milk, butter, and cheese, and provide for the export of\r\ndairy products. The export trade has fluctuated much, but has never\r\nexceeded the product of half a million cows. With the closing years of\r\nthe century, it is estimated that there is one milch cow in the United\r\nStates to every four persons. This makes the total number of cows about\r\n17,500,000. They are quite unevenly distributed over the country, being\r\nlargely concentrated in the great dairy States. Thus Iowa leads with a\r\nmillion and a half cows, followed by New York with almost as many, and\r\nthen Illinois and Pennsylvania with about a million each. The States\r\nhaving over half a million each are Wisconsin, Ohio, Kansas, Missouri,\r\nMinnesota, Nebraska, and Indiana. Texas is credited with 700,000, but\r\nvery few of them are dairy animals. In the Middle and Eastern States\r\nthe milk product goes very largely to the supply of the numerous\r\ncities and large towns. In the Central West and Northwest butter is\r\nthe principal dairy product. It is estimated that the dairy animals of\r\nthe United States include nearly half a million which are pure bred,\r\nand that this blood has been so generally diffused that more than one\r\nfourth of the cattle are grades.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DAIRY MAID.]\r\n\r\nThe following table gives approximately an exhibit of the quantity and\r\nvalue of the dairy products of the United States in the year 1900:—\r\n\r\n  ======================================================================\r\n    Cows,  |Product.| Rate of |  Total Product.   | Rate of|Total Value,\r\n  Millions.|        | Product.|                   |  Value.|  Dollars.\r\n  ---------+--------+---------+-------------------+--------+------------\r\n     11    | Butter |130 lbs. |1,430,000,000 lbs. |18 cents|257,400,000\r\n      1    | Cheese |300 lbs. |  300,000,000 lbs. | 8 cents| 24,000,000\r\n      5½   | Milk   |380 gals.|2,090,000,000 gals.| 8 cents|167,200,000\r\n  ======================================================================\r\n\r\nThis gives the grand total of the dairy products of the country a value\r\nof $448,600,000. If to this be added the skim milk, buttermilk, and\r\nwhey, at their proper feeding value, and the calves dropped yearly,\r\nthe annual aggregate value of the produce of the dairy cows exceeds\r\n$500,000,000. This may be accepted as a conservative estimate.\r\n\r\nIn a classification of the various annual farm products of the country\r\nby values, meats and closely related products stand first in order,\r\nthe corn crop second, dairy products and the hay crop alternate in the\r\nthird and fourth places, and wheat occupies the fifth. Hay and corn are\r\nso largely and directly tributary to the dairy as raw materials for its\r\nsupport, that it is fair to place the products of the dairy as second\r\nonly to meat products in the general list. The cotton crop of the\r\ncountry is considered one of great importance, but during recent years\r\nit rarely equals the butter crop in value. The dairy aggregate exceeds\r\nall the mining products of the United States other than coal, oil,\r\nand gas. There never has been a year when the entire gold and silver\r\nproduct of the world was enough to buy the annual dairy products of\r\nthis country at the present time. These comparisons show the commercial\r\nimportance which the dairying of America has assumed. It is a branch\r\nof farming of such magnitude as to command attention and justify all\r\nreasonable provisions to guard its interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CENTURY’S MORAL PROGRESS\r\n\r\nBY SARA Y. STEVENSON, Sc. D.,\r\n\r\n_Secretary Department of Archæology, University of Pennsylvania_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn dealing with a subject so indefinite in its limits as the progress\r\nof morals in the nineteenth century, it may be well to establish by a\r\nbrief survey of previous facts some solid basis upon which to rest the\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\nThe notion of Duty or of moral obligation—i. e., of well-doing viewed\r\nin the abstract and outside of expediency—does not appear to have been\r\nbrought forward by the Greek philosophers, to whom is mainly due the\r\norigin of our own conceptions with regard to morality.\r\n\r\nEven Plato, who dealt with nearly all duties, while insisting\r\nespecially upon the negative duty of committing no injustice or evil,\r\neven against one’s foes, nowhere systematically treats of Duty. Indeed,\r\nthe Greek equivalent for the word did not exist in his time, and the\r\nnotion was conveyed by a periphrase.\r\n\r\nThat morals have a bearing upon the welfare and character not only of\r\nthe individual and of the family, but of the whole body politic, was\r\nhowever early recognized. Theognis, for instance, who lived in the\r\nsixth century B. C., stigmatized in the most energetic terms the evil\r\ninfluence exercised upon the destiny of nations by the immorality of\r\nthe upper classes.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier schemes of civilization, where worship played a dominant\r\npolitical rôle, morals were regarded as under the protection of the\r\nsacred law. Worship and law were closely united in the government, and\r\nmorals were included in these and governed by motives of expediency.\r\n\r\nMan’s obligation to the Deity was then mainly confined to material\r\nofferings and propitiatory rites, whilst the law dealt with conduct\r\nin so far as order must be enforced, authority respected, and certain\r\nmutual rights recognized, if the welfare of the nation was to be\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\nThat the moral standards of these early societies were high cannot\r\nbe doubted. Those which prevailed in ancient Egypt, as preserved to\r\nus in the maxims of sages, as well as in certain chapters of the\r\nsacred books, prove that the rule of conduct which was to insure to\r\nthe subjects of the Pharaohs respect and popularity in this world and\r\nhappiness in the world to come was in no way inferior to our own.\r\nThe men who taught their contemporaries “Do not save thy life at the\r\ncost of another” had little to learn from the high-bred Parisians who\r\nrecently escaped unhurt from the burning walls of the French Charity\r\nBazaar.\r\n\r\nFor the Greek thinkers, however, who first systematically dealt with\r\nthe subject, Ethics was a branch of Politics, i. e., the Science of\r\nGovernment. Aristotle, like Socrates and Plato, took for the starting\r\npoint of his argument the sovereign good, or the idea of absolute\r\nwell-being. All that man undertakes has an aim which, under analysis,\r\nis found to be the greatest advantage to him who is acting. Accordingly\r\nall knowledge tends to this end; and as all its elements are more or\r\nless connected, there must be one, the final end of which is essential;\r\nthis is the political science which aims at the highest well-being not\r\nonly of each man, but of man collectively, i. e., of society.\r\n\r\nThe nature of this highest “well-being,” which is generally termed\r\n“happiness,” gave rise among Greek philosophers to discussions which\r\nhave been revived by modern thinkers.\r\n\r\nIt may therefore be stated that in ancient thought, at least until\r\nthe time of the Stoics, morals and virtue were studied, whether\r\nin connection with religion or with politics, under the light of\r\nexpediency rather than under that of abstract right, and that “they\r\nwere discussed as functions more than as moral obligations.”\r\n\r\nThe fullness of significance which at present is conveyed in the\r\nword “Duty” is mainly due to the gradual and complex development of\r\nreligious, legal, and philosophical modes of thought, in which certain\r\nhuman acts are regarded as enjoined and others as forbidden by a\r\nhigher power, and in which conscience enters as an important and ever\r\nincreasing factor. A sense of duty is the legitimate product of human\r\nnature under cultivation. But although we should look in vain among the\r\nancients for the abstract notions which the words “Conscience, Duty,\r\nand Right” evoke in the modern mind, we find in groping our way up the\r\nstream of time that germs of these concepts had long lain concealed\r\nin the precepts of ancient moralists. The fact of virtue existed long\r\nbefore it was made the subject of theoretical systems, and if with the\r\ndevelopment of the reasoning faculty our moral code has been elaborated\r\nand our ethical terminology enriched, broadly speaking, the rules of\r\nconduct laid down by civilized men in the remote past and those which\r\ngovern us to-day are, in kind, virtually the same. Thou shalt not\r\nkill; Thou shalt not steal; Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s wife;\r\nThou shalt not bear false witness, are coeval with the beginnings of\r\ncommunities. It is in the scope and degree of their application—not in\r\ntheir nature—that mainly lies the difference existing in this respect\r\nbetween the past and the present.\r\n\r\nIn the highest stage of our moral development the unselfishness\r\nwhich seeks gratification in the welfare of others and in duty\r\naccomplished, at the cost of self, may in final analysis be reduced to\r\na refined egoism. The motive held up to man by most moralists is still\r\nexpediency. The reward, whether it is promised on this earth or in the\r\nworld to come, is still a reward, and to the “greatest advantage of him\r\nwho is acting.”\r\n\r\nMoreover, moral standards to-day, as in the past, have a strong bearing\r\nupon political government, and it is in studying the development of\r\ndemocratic ideas that we may best follow the evolution of modern ethics\r\nas characteristic of our epoch; for to this development is due a higher\r\nsense of justice, the recognition of the rights of men and of the\r\nunimportance of the ego as compared with the race, all of which form\r\ndistinctive features of the modern creed for which the words “altruism”\r\nand “humanitarianism” have been coined. It may also be said, to the\r\nhonor of the present century, that there exists a growing tendency to\r\naccept abstract truth and right outside of expediency as standards\r\nof conduct, and to apply these regardless of sex, class, or persons\r\naccording to the inflexible logic of a trained reason.\r\n\r\nTwo thousand years ago Christianity established itself upon the wreck\r\nof ancient civilizations, preserving that which in them was immortal.\r\nGrafted upon the Roman world, the gospel of democracy which it preached\r\ncould be accepted as the official religion of the Empire only at the\r\ncost of its own purity. How could God and Mammon rule together? How\r\ncould a Constantine rise to an understanding of the Teacher who said:\r\n“Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles\r\nexercise lordship over them, and their great ones exercise authority\r\nover them.... But so shall it not be among you; but whosoever will be\r\ngreat among you shall be your minister; and whosoever of you will be\r\nthe chiefest shall be servant of all.” (St. Mark x. 42–44.) Christ had\r\nestablished religion among his followers as distinct from worship. The\r\npeople soon relapsed into worship, whilst for the clergy theology took\r\nthe place of religion.\r\n\r\nWith the alliance formed between Church and State in the Christian\r\ncommunity, much of the Sermon on the Mount was necessarily forgotten;\r\nmany of the parables in which the Teacher embodied his doctrine of\r\njustice, of tolerance, of love and humility, were to lose their living\r\nforce. Under the banner of faith, conduct sank to the second rank. The\r\ndry subtleties of scholasticism helped to crush morality beneath the\r\nwords and formulæ of a learned dialectic. Although for centuries the\r\nspirit of Christ continued to protect the weak and the lowly, although\r\nfrom the very body of the Church, then ever ready in its arrogance to\r\ncast its anathemas upon every effort of man to assert his freedom,\r\nsprang reformers who endeavored to restore to the gospel some of its\r\nearly significance, the Church strayed ever farther from its founder.\r\nWas this because, as Michelet said, the reformers themselves needed\r\nreforming? Once more man found himself crushed under the law which\r\nChrist had declared was made for him, until, at last, in the forcible\r\nwords of Mr. Darmesteter, of all the Teacher’s lessons Christian\r\nRome seemed to remember only one, “Return unto Cæsar that which is\r\nCæsar’s.” However fiercely monarchy might struggle against the temporal\r\nencroachments of the Church, it joined with it to repress the people.\r\n“Authority rested upon a mystery. Its right came from above. Power\r\nwas divine. Obedience to it was a sacred duty and inquiry became a\r\nblasphemy.”\r\n\r\nThen from the great schools and universities the developing intellect\r\nof Europe awakened to a sense of its rights. Suddenly there came\r\ninquiries into the reality of this spiritual power over human souls\r\nand over the human understanding which Rome claimed to be derived from\r\nHeaven. In its revolt against dogma, from Abélard and Arnold di Brescia\r\nto Huss and Wickliff, from Luther and Pascal to Voltaire and Rousseau,\r\nthe human thought struggled for freedom under the banner of learning\r\nand of reason, and fought for the rights of the people against the\r\nprivileged few. “I will not speak of tolerance,” cried Mirabeau, in\r\nhis plea for the emancipation of the Jews in the National Convention\r\n(1791); “the freedom of conscience is a right so sacred that even the\r\nname of tolerance involves a species of tyranny.”\r\n\r\nAt the close of the last century, freedom at last planted its standard\r\nin Europe above the ruins of despotism. In the fiery torrent which\r\nswept away the ancient traditions of the Church, as well as those of\r\nthe State, it seemed for a time as though religion as well as the\r\nchurch, right as well as might, must disappear from the surface of the\r\nearth, and that, in the smoke of battles and the revelry of reason,\r\ntruth and morals must perish and anarchy prevail. But a moral rule is\r\nindispensable to society, and “Religion is after all but the highest\r\nexpression of human science and of human conscience.” Its germ,\r\ninnate in man, grows with his understanding in its constant strain to\r\nestablish a relation between himself and the universe.\r\n\r\nTo the moral chaos that for a brief space followed the overthrow of\r\nthe old order of things succeeded, in the beginning of this century,\r\na period of readjustment, and now, in the words of a poet whose own\r\nmental processes are a type of those of his time, “Of a hopeless epoch\r\nis born a fearless age.”\r\n\r\nAfter the absolute negations of the early years of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, after the violent controversies not only of arrogant science\r\nand of prejudiced faith, but of scientific and theological schools\r\n_inter se_ which fill the serious literature of the last generations,\r\na reconciliation between faith and science is taking place, a\r\ncertain unity of thought is being reached with regard to conduct and\r\nto the rights of men. And the century, at its close, shows us the\r\nProtestant churchman less tenacious of his dogma, the Romanist less\r\ncertain of the infallibility of Rome, the scholar less convinced of\r\nthe infallibility of his science, the agnostic less boastful of his\r\nskepticism, the monarchist awakened from his dreams of a divine right\r\nof kings and of a preordained subjection of men, the socialist sobered\r\nof his revolutionary frenzy and repudiating the extremes of anarchy\r\nand nihilism born of his earlier teachings, all marching shoulder to\r\nshoulder under the banner of a broad tolerance toward a common goal,\r\nin a united effort to lift the masses from the depths of poverty,\r\nignorance, vice, and often crime, to which centuries of repression\r\nseemed to consign them, and seeking in friendly coöperation to bring\r\nabout a better social order.\r\n\r\nFor in our time has taken place a great broadening of the moral\r\nstandpoint from which the old rules of conduct are in future to be\r\napplied. Toward the end of the last century the equality and fraternity\r\nof men was proclaimed to the European world and received a baptism of\r\nblood. This official declaration of the rights of men professed to\r\nbe universal; but, like other dispensations that had preceded it, in\r\nits application it fell short of the democratic ideal. All men were\r\ndeclared equal, yet with striking inconsistency those who proclaimed\r\nthe new creed held others in bondage, and race disqualification\r\nsurvived.\r\n\r\nThe honor of leading in the greatest moral reform which the world has\r\nseen is due to the French Revolutionary leaders. On February 2, 1794,\r\nthe Convention decreed the abolition of slavery throughout the French\r\ncolonies, and all slaves were admitted to the rights of citizenship.\r\nIt was only in 1833 that slavery was abolished in the British colonies\r\nby Act of Parliament, and that coolie labor was substituted. In 1861\r\nEmperor Alexander II., following the policy inaugurated by his father,\r\nNicholas I., freed the serfs in Russia. It is a curious fact that the\r\nUnited States, which for many reasons might have been expected to lead\r\nin the movement, only followed in 1863. The terrible struggle of the\r\npublic conscience against expediency and class interest, which then\r\ntook place upon this continent, must form one of the most important\r\nlessons which this century will offer to posterity.\r\n\r\nRight prevailed, and with this triumph of justice the human conscience,\r\nthrowing aside casuistry and evasion for a time, faced its problems\r\nhonestly and asserted its own sovereignty.\r\n\r\nThe consequences of the mighty struggle did not stop here. Once the\r\nprinciples of abstract justice established, not only against might\r\nbut against tradition and expediency; once the rights not only of men\r\n(as in 1776 and in 1789), but of all men, recognized in a broader\r\napplication of the principles of a true democracy, there came a\r\ntendency to extend its application to mankind at large; and women,\r\nwho according to their station in life had hitherto been dealt with\r\ntheoretically as either useful or ornamental possessions, began to find\r\ntheir place as members of the community. The rights of slaves as men\r\nhad been officially proclaimed. The rights of women as citizens began\r\nto be discussed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CZAR ALEXANDER II. OF RUSSIA.]\r\n\r\nIn the widespread shifting of levels which has taken place in the last\r\nhundred years, affecting directly and indirectly the moral progress\r\nof all classes of society, certain important elements have entered\r\nwhich cannot be overlooked in the present discussion, and which in\r\nfuture ages must stand as preëminently characteristic of the nineteenth\r\ncentury and the Anglo-Saxon ascendency.\r\n\r\nThe reign of machinery in the industrial world, the advent of steam,\r\nof electricity, of compressed air, as motors, have done away with\r\nthe human machine. Whether in peace or in war the skilled workman\r\nhas crowded him out. Labor-saving inventions have done away with the\r\nnecessity for a multiplicity of hands. The need to-day is for trained\r\nheads. From evaporated fruit and canned meats to heat, light, and\r\ninter-communication, science is brought to bear upon every detail\r\nof existence. As an immediate consequence of the part necessarily\r\nplayed by learning in our industrial and commercial life under modern\r\nconditions, public education has become the mainspring of national\r\nprosperity. Freedom and public education have made our laboring classes\r\nthe self-respecting, thinking people they are. The human automaton upon\r\nwhich formerly played the greed, the vice, the craft of others now\r\nholds a comparatively small place in the modern community, outside of\r\nLatin Europe. The “vile multitude,” as M. Thiers still stigmatized it\r\n(before he turned republican), no longer exists. The world has moved,\r\nand so have men.\r\n\r\n“If the shuttle would weave of itself,” said Aristotle in his apology\r\nfor slavery, “there would be no need of slaves.” The miracle, which\r\nseemed impossible to the founder of science, has been accomplished with\r\nthe predicted result. The shuttle weaves of itself and slavery has\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nEven in Oriental lands, under Anglo-Saxon supremacy the carrying out\r\nof great public works is stimulating a demand for education among\r\nthe people, and the sum total of ignorance and poverty is gradually\r\ndecreasing and making way for better conditions; for only a trained\r\nhand guided by a trained intellect can use the modern tools. This\r\napplies to agriculture as well as to industries.\r\n\r\nIn the rising tide of intellectual and material progress, woman has\r\nbeen carried along to a great extent unconsciously. It is a matter\r\nof grave doubt whether the early “suffragists” did more than be the\r\nfirst to recognize and herald the logical drift of contemporary events.\r\nIt is through higher education that woman has quietly forged her way\r\nto the place she occupies in the modern community, and that she is\r\nclaiming her share of the common heritage of freedom and independence.\r\nThe prophecy embodied in Bulwer’s “Coming Race” is being realized.\r\nFrom year to year her sphere is broadening. She is fast becoming\r\nself-supporting. In education she already holds a leading place. Her\r\ninfluence as a moving force is becoming patent. It is officially\r\nrecognized to a varying degree in certain parts of the civilized\r\nworld,—England, New Zealand, Russia, and twenty-two of the United\r\nStates, where she stands before the law not only in her relation to man\r\nas his mother, wife, or sister, but in a direct relation to society, as\r\na reasoning being and as a citizen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR EDWARD BULWER.]\r\n\r\nThe increased self-respect born in woman’s mind of a consciousness of\r\nequal training and culture, the growing number of women whose ambitions\r\nhave been stimulated to higher achievement, and the consequent\r\nincreasing influence wielded by them in the community, suggest the\r\nthought that in time their legal status will be generally established,\r\nas it already is now in several localities.\r\n\r\nMuch leveling has taken place since the abolition of the “ancient\r\nrégime,” not only in the relations of the various classes composing\r\nsociety, but in the relation of men and women. The process is still\r\nsteadily going on. And it is not unreasonable to believe that, with the\r\ngradual elevation of the ideals of one half of the population,—that\r\nhalf which is in control of the early training of children of both\r\nsexes,—a common standard of character and morality may in time be\r\nacknowledged which will admit of but one rule by which the actions\r\nof mankind, without distinction of persons, class, or sex, may be\r\nmeasured. The fact that all distinction in favor of the privileged\r\nclass has already been removed in the eyes of modern public opinion\r\nholds out such a hope. The casuistry which still discriminates between\r\nevil-doers can but retard moral progress, and the more earnestly modern\r\nparents urge upon their sons the same observance of the laws of hygiene\r\nand propriety, of truth and self respect, as they exact from their\r\ndaughters, the nearer to true civilization will society reach.\r\n\r\nThe world is yet far from this goal. No legislative act has as yet\r\nsaved society from the ravages of vice, sensuality, and greed, and\r\nto-day every degree of savagery and immorality still exists in\r\nso-called civilized countries. Education, taking the word in its\r\nbroadest sense, can alone, by its refining influence, force the\r\nsavage to give way before reasoning man. And it is by the constantly\r\nincreasing proportion of educated, self-respecting men and women\r\nthat the coarser instincts of the human race are being controlled and\r\nbrought to yield to reason. By holding up the same standards of conduct\r\nto humanity, the important place occupied by casuistry and expediency,\r\nin the discussion of the ethical problems set before the moralist, may\r\nbe reduced, and a logical facing of the serious issues to be met may\r\nfollow. Such a result must tend to strengthen the marriage tie and the\r\nfamily relation, upon which rests the whole moral structure of society.\r\n\r\nAt present, modern casuistry, if it no longer seeks to justify\r\nfalsehood and crime committed on behalf of Church or State, still\r\nexonerates, in the world of affairs, the high railroad official or\r\nthe industrial magnate of an infraction of the higher code by which\r\nhis own personal integrity is judged, provided that infraction is\r\ncommitted in the interest of his constituents. Many a man of high\r\nstanding, whose personal honor is beyond suspicion and whose conscience\r\nwould not allow him to take an unfair advantage of another, does not\r\nhesitate to transgress when dealing with rival corporate bodies or\r\nwith public interests. Hence the corruption which prevails in public\r\nlife to a degree dangerous to the commonwealth, and which is in direct\r\ncontradiction with the professed standards of the age. Must we then\r\nthink that living up to the highest moral standard is incompatible with\r\nbusiness success, and agree with M. Jules Lemaître that “the attaining\r\nto moral perfection is really possible only in the solitude of literary\r\nor artistic pursuits, in the humility of manual labor, or in the\r\ndignity of such disinterested functions as those of priest or soldier”?\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, new conditions have created new problems which the\r\npublic conscience alone can solve—as it has already solved that of\r\nslavery and of race—with unflinching logic.\r\n\r\nThe human mind, if less concerned than it was in the days of Molina\r\nwith polemics on the nature of the human will,—a question, by the\r\nway, which Rome after eleven years and thirty-three Councils dared not\r\nthen settle,—or with theological controversies regarding the value of\r\nindulgences, is not yet at peace with itself. Indeed, for being less\r\nimmaterial, the issues now before it for adjustment are, owing to their\r\nbearing upon practical life, all the more vital to the moral health of\r\nthe body politic.\r\n\r\nTo the respective rights and duties of labor and capital our best\r\nthinkers must turn their attention before an equitable solution can be\r\nreached. That such a solution must be reached cannot be doubted, for\r\nthe interests at stake are fundamental.\r\n\r\nWhilst individualism in thought and in conduct asserts itself at every\r\nturn, never were the principles of organization so actively carried\r\nout among all classes of society. To the strain caused by the forming\r\nof trades unions and of united labor leagues for the protection of the\r\nwage-earner is now succeeding the danger produced by the concentration\r\nof capital in the hands of powerful corporations and the creation of\r\nmighty trusts, the undue extension of which in this country seems to\r\nthreaten the prosperity of the nation and to add to its political\r\ncorruption. As against these monopolies, public ownership and operation\r\nof common utilities is being successfully tried, notably in England and\r\nthe British Colonies, and the honest municipalization of all community\r\nservice, carried on as the post-office is carried on among us, results\r\nin positive benefit to the people, that is, in good wages and reduced\r\ntaxes. To discuss these important problems would encroach upon the\r\ndomain of political economy and social science; but there is no doubt\r\nthat the public morality is closely dependent upon their solution.\r\n\r\nWhether so-called civilized nations, whilst regarding murder as a\r\ncapital offense and punishing dueling when indulged in by individuals,\r\nwill long continue to train their best men at enormous expense, in\r\norder that in cold blood they may scientifically destroy the greatest\r\npossible number of other trained and equally good men; whether peaceful\r\ncommunities of practical tradesmen will some day cease to emulate\r\nbarbarians in their rejoicings over the slaughter of so-called enemies\r\nwhom they are individually prepared to befriend and whose prowess they\r\nare ready to extol, are glaring contradictions offered by the problem\r\nof war which must be left to future generations to reconcile. The\r\nleading part which the Anglo-Saxon race has taken in urging arbitration\r\nas a proper means of settling international differences places it in\r\nthe foremost rank of civilization; whilst the Peace Conference proposed\r\nby one of Europe’s most powerful potentates, the Czar of Russia, must\r\nbring a ray of hope to the hearts of those who labor for the advent of\r\nuniversal peace.\r\n\r\nSuch are the great moral issues of the present day; and in these many\r\nminor ones are included. Everywhere and at all periods of history\r\nthe theory of ethics has widely differed from practical conduct. The\r\nrace conflict which is taking place in France as the result of the\r\nDreyfus trial, more than a century after the emancipation of the Jews\r\nbefore the law was proclaimed, is a late illustration of this fact.\r\nTo this, the corruption and failure of justice which recent exposures\r\nhave revealed in the highest circles of republican France add peculiar\r\nsignificance. As already stated, the broad outlines established in\r\nprecept remain unchanged, and it is in their logical application that\r\nlie all present growth and future hope.\r\n\r\nTo trace, even in sketchy outline, the debit and credit account of\r\nmodern ideas upon the various subjects involved in the above mentioned\r\nissues would be a serious undertaking. A chapter must be devoted\r\nto each nation, for the moral progress of each differs as does its\r\nbesetting sin. Moreover, every shade of opinion must be weighed and\r\nconsidered. Inherited traditional views are, in each modern mind,\r\nhopelessly interwoven with the new articles of a code of morals which\r\npublic opinion is even now evolving from contemporary conditions. “Each\r\nof us,” says Edmond Schérer, “belongs to two civilizations, that which\r\nis coming and that which is going; and as we are accustomed to the\r\nfirst, we are poorly placed to judge or enjoy the latter.”\r\n\r\nThere never was an epoch when the struggle for existence was fiercer\r\nand when earthly possessions were more keenly prized. But despite the\r\nmany survivals which still point to a semi-barbaric inheritance of\r\nselfishness descended through millenniums, a decided moral gain may, on\r\nthe whole, be placed to the credit of our era. With the decrease of the\r\nsum total of ignorance, not only among the lower but among the upper\r\nclasses, the sum total of well-doing and well-being has immeasurably\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nThe sympathy for suffering is more widespread than it has ever been.\r\nNo middle-aged person can fail to note the rapid change which has\r\ntaken place in the public mind with regard to the general treatment\r\nnot only of children, but of animals. The present mode of dealing with\r\nschool children according to their individual capacity, the trust in\r\ntheir honor which governs their relation to the teacher, the absence\r\nof any corporal punishment, form a recent departure in education well\r\ncalculated to produce the best moral results.\r\n\r\nThe improvement of modern methods in relief work as well as in the\r\ntreatment of vice—now viewed more in the light of a pathological\r\ncondition than in that of a sin—must make this a memorable epoch\r\nin the ethical history of humanity. No branch of civilization has\r\nundergone greater change in modern times both in theory and practice\r\nthan public and private charity. To-day the humanitarian endeavors\r\nto lift up the fallen and the needy, and almsgiving on the part\r\nof the well-to-do is fast becoming relegated to the category of a\r\nself-indulgence which is not to be encouraged. The distinction between\r\nthe old methods and the new is given in the formula that “henceforth\r\nthe chief test of charity will be the effect upon the recipient.”\r\nAny relief calculated to undermine self-reliance and independence is\r\ndiscouraged by those who have in view the prevention of our moral ills\r\nrather than their relief.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAPTAIN ALFRED DREYFUS.]\r\n\r\nIndeed, the new school preaches scientific charity as against emotional\r\ncharity. What it may have lost in impulse it has more than made up in\r\neffectiveness. The attempt to teach the needy to help themselves, the\r\nwork of college settlements and of the organized efforts in the poorest\r\nand most neglected districts of large cities, with a view to fostering\r\nby personal contact and example habits of thrift and self-respect where\r\nthose virtues are most lacking, are among the truest if more homely\r\nglories of the closing century.\r\n\r\nVerily, never was a more thoughtful effort made everywhere to mitigate\r\nthe cruel distinctions of race and sex, of wealth and poverty, and\r\nto “harmonize the social antagonisms” of modern life. Never was so\r\nmuch consideration given to the betterment of humanity, nor was the\r\naggregate of earnestness so great.\r\n\r\nIn our more robust intellectual world the tree is judged by its fruit,\r\nand acts tell, not creed. The principle that well-doing, unless it\r\nis disinterested, forfeits its claim to the highest respect of men,\r\nis growing in strength, whilst the feeling is gaining ground among\r\nthe thoughtful that in the development of personality may be found a\r\nsufficient motive for the exercise of virtue, and that character, not\r\nreward, _being_ not _having_, are the highest aims.\r\n\r\nIf we resume the moral progress of the nineteenth century, allowing\r\nfor its inconsistencies, carefully weighing its negative and positive\r\nresults, and taking as a balance what is original in its contribution\r\nto the ethical development of the human race, we will find that this\r\ncontribution mainly lies in the direction of tolerance and of altruism.\r\nThis altruism is distinct from the charity of St. Vincent, which\r\nsacrificed self in a loving attempt to relieve individual distress.\r\nSuch pure sacrifice, admirable as it is, is not only narrow in its\r\nscope, but because of its austerity must fail to survive in the\r\nstruggle for existence. Modern altruism aims at removing the main cause\r\nof individual distress, and spends itself in educational efforts, in\r\nwhich the well-doer finds happiness in the consciousness of usefulness.\r\nIt is also unlike the socialism of Condorcet, which reached down in an\r\nendeavor to make all institutions subservient to the interests of the\r\npoorer and most numerous classes, for it aims at lifting these to the\r\nhighest possible plane. The mountain summits are not to be lowered, but\r\nthe valleys are being filled. To raise the people, to build up, not to\r\ntear down, is the avowed end of all modern moral effort, and must ever\r\nstamp the humanitarian struggles of the present age as distinct from\r\nthose of the eighteenth and preceding centuries.\r\n\r\nWith this we may claim an increase in individual freedom, and a\r\nperceptible tendency to a logical and ever broadening conception, not\r\nonly of the rights, but of the duties of citizenship; to a more honest\r\nrecognition of the place assigned by expediency to evil in the social\r\nand business intercourse of a practical life; to a growing scorn of\r\ncasuistry, and to a stronger faith in the reality of right and of\r\nabstract truth as they are revealed in every thinking man’s heart, and\r\nthe uniformity of which is reflected in the public conscience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGRESS OF SANITARY SCIENCE\r\n\r\nBY CHARLES McINTIRE, A.M., M.D.,\r\n\r\n_Lecturer on Sanitary Science, Lafayette College, Easton, Pa._\r\n\r\n\r\nSince blessings brighten as they take their flight, it may be difficult\r\nto realize how much of our present happiness and comfort depend upon\r\nthe constantly abiding benefactions brought about by the progress of\r\nSanitary Science in the present cycle. The proper care of the body\r\nand the prevention of disease, rather than its cure, have occupied\r\nthe minds of men from the dawn of history. Moses is the author of a\r\nwell-digested code of hygiene, and erudite scholars can find hints of\r\nthe proper conservation of health in the Egyptian papyri. Hippocrates\r\nwrote about the prevention as well as the cure of disease; indeed,\r\nall along the course of time the master minds of medicine attempted\r\nthe solution of many of the problems of Sanitary Science as eagerly\r\nas they sought for the _elixir vitæ_ or for the universal solvent.\r\nNotwithstanding all this, one can truthfully say that sanitation could\r\nnot be fairly termed Sanitary Science until its rules of procedure\r\nbegan to be formulated with more or less exactness upon careful\r\nexperiment and accurately recorded observation. Sanitary science,\r\nas such, could not begin to be until pathology (a knowledge of the\r\nmorbid processes of disease) and etiology (a study of the causation\r\nof disease) had builded upon a scientific foundation. Before this all\r\ndeductions were from experience, and had no other reason than the\r\nseeming helpfulness of the procedure; after this, as fast as the facts\r\nwere demonstrated, deductions were made that determined a procedure\r\nwhich would of a certainty accomplish the purpose. In the olden times,\r\nduring an epidemic of a contagious disease, tar barrels were burned in\r\nthe streets,—and not without some benefit. At the present, the room,\r\nwith its contents, can be disinfected with a certainty of destroying\r\nevery atom of contagion.\r\n\r\nThis difference must be kept in mind when comparing the old with the\r\nnew, and the true reason of the great advance be recognized as due to\r\nthe spirit of scientific investigation, which began in the latter part\r\nof the last century with the employment of instruments of precision\r\nin research, and which has developed so wonderfully up to the present\r\nthat the experimental psychologist measures the minute portion of time\r\nit takes to form a thought. At the same time, it must be kept in mind\r\nthat the sciences which furnish sanitary science much of its material\r\nare progressing and, because progressing, changing; that the conditions\r\ndesired to be removed are prevailing, and the necessity of overcoming\r\nthem urgent. Not in every case has the sanitarian fully demonstrated\r\nand laid down scientifically accurate data on which to base his method\r\nof procedure. Hence it happens that even now sanitary empiricism must\r\nneeds be mingled with sanitary science, and the mingling is sometimes\r\nas much of a motley as the dress of the court fool of the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nSince sanitary science had its origin during the present century,\r\nit will be helpful to assign a definite period for its birth. Not\r\nthat any one would have the temerity to dogmatically assert that the\r\nscience came into being at a fixed date, but rather to fix a period\r\nof time when the conditions working through the ages were so shaped\r\nthat, perforce, the problems of sanitation would thereafter be treated\r\nmore in a scientific and less in an empirical method than before. This\r\ntime is associated with the beginning of the reign of Queen Victoria\r\nof England, since the first Act of Parliament for the registration of\r\nbirths, marriages, and deaths was passed in 1837, and the beginning\r\nmade of accurately gathering information which is to the sanitarian\r\nwhat the pulse is to the physician. With his fingers on this tell-tale\r\nof the flow of the heart-blood of the nation, he is enabled to\r\ndetermine whether disease is above or below the normal, the character\r\nof the disease that abounds, and its whereabouts. Knowing where to find\r\nany disease in excess, he can study the conditions and surroundings,\r\ncomparing them with other places, whether afflicted in like manner or,\r\nmore favored, free from the disease. By means of these vital statistics\r\nhe can compare year with year, and tell with a degree of exactness\r\nheretofore impossible whether any disease is increasing or decreasing;\r\nhe can lay his returns by the side of the figures of the meteorologist\r\nand learn if the weather has any influence on the death-rate; he can\r\nfollow the results of his efforts to improve the condition of the\r\npeople and vindicate his expenditure of the public money by pointing\r\nto the reduced mortality rate. It may seem to be a gruesome task for\r\nevery physician in the land to send to the proper official a notice\r\nof each death and of each patient suffering from a disease apt to be\r\ncommunicated to some one else; and almost ghoulish for the officer\r\nto sit at his desk, day after day, and catalogue and tabulate these\r\nreturns. But it is only a modern version of the old riddle of Samson,\r\nout of the bitter came forth the sweet; for without this, much of the\r\nprogress of sanitary science would be well-nigh impossible.\r\n\r\nThe act adopted in Great Britain has been modified and improved upon\r\nsince then, and in the United States many of our cities and some of our\r\nStates have been engaged in a similar effort. As yet we have no central\r\nbureau or collecting office for the nation; nor is this necessary, if\r\neach State would do its duty, or, at least, the general government in\r\nthat event need only tabulate the returns of each of the States. The\r\neffort is now making, under the auspices of the American Public Health\r\nAssociation, to secure a uniform method of registration in all offices\r\ncollecting vital statistics, by which the same name will be given to\r\nthe same disease and the same facts recorded in each return made.\r\nThis will cause a little confusion at first in those offices where\r\nstatistics have been tabulated for a number of years, but the advantage\r\nwill be so great as to fully repay any inconvenience at the first. If\r\nwe desire to obtain the full benefits from the advance of sanitary\r\nscience, we must see to it that in every State there is an efficient\r\nbureau of vital statistics, whether under the supervision of the State\r\nBoard of Health or some other department of the State. The absence\r\nof such a bureau reflects upon the intelligence of the people or the\r\nintegrity of the law-making power.\r\n\r\nAre there tangible results to warrant so sweeping an assertion? is a\r\nfair question, since at the time of the preparation of the census of\r\n1890 New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut,\r\nNew York, New Jersey, and Delaware were the only States collecting\r\nvital statistics, and since then but Maine and Michigan have been\r\nadded. Before quoting figures, it must be premised that even now the\r\nreturns only approximate accuracy; they were much more inaccurate at\r\nthe first, and before the general registration was undertaken most\r\nof the statements are merely estimates, after the fashion of the\r\ngeographer who gives the number of inhabitants in China, where a census\r\nnever has been taken. It may happen that the benefits are not as great\r\nas the figures seem to show, but after making all allowance there is\r\ngreat improvement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LIVES SAVED BY PUBLIC-HEALTH WORK.\r\n\r\n  _Comparison of death-rates in Michigan from scarlet fever and\r\n    small-pox before and since the State Board of Health was\r\n    established, and from typhoid fever before and since its\r\n    restriction was undertaken by the State Board. (Compiled from the\r\n    State Department’s “Vital Statistics” of Michigan.)_\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe “Encyclopædia Britannica” asserts that two centuries ago the\r\nmortality of London was 80 per 1000, while now it is but a little over\r\n20. In 1841, out of every 100,000 people in England, 30,000 would have\r\ndied before reaching the age of 10, and one half would have died before\r\nthey were 40 years old; in the decennium 1881–90, before 30,000 would\r\nhave died out of each 100,000 some would have lived to be 17, and some\r\nwould have lived to be 55 before one half of the number had departed\r\ninto the unknown and the hereafter.\r\n\r\nThe figures of the statistician must be quoted again and again in the\r\nprogress of the article, as no more tangible evidence can be given of\r\nthe benefits resulting from improved methods of sanitation. Very early\r\na coincidence was observed between the uncleanly and the death-rate.\r\nNeighborhoods where little or no care was taken to remove the refuse,\r\nwhere there were foul drains and a deficient water supply, were found\r\nto be the abodes of special forms of disease,—so much so, that these\r\ndiseases soon received the name of “filth diseases.” Acting upon the\r\nsuggestion, the gospel of cleanliness was preached and its practice\r\nenforced. There was a “redding up” in its eventuality as thorough as\r\nthe cleansing of Santiago de Cuba in recent days. It did not take\r\nlong to discover that decaying organic matter in some way was the\r\noffending body, and that this contaminated the water supply. Wells were\r\ncondemned and public water supplies installed; means were sought to\r\nenable the cleansing to be constantly carried on, and sewers for house\r\ndrainage followed or accompanied the water supply. In proportion as\r\nthis has been thoroughly done has the death-rate from certain diseases\r\ndiminished. During the last century the European armies were decimated\r\nby fever (typhus or relapsing) to such a degree that the work of the\r\nfell destroyer at Santiago was trifling in comparison. On into the\r\npresent century, the great scourge of Great Britain was these same two\r\nfevers; so much so, that “the fever” meant the dread jail or typhus\r\nfever. It was imported into this country, and epidemics of “ship fever”\r\nwere of frequent occurrence. Thus, as late as 1846, it was estimated\r\nthat in Dublin alone there were 40,000 cases of fever, with a total\r\nin Ireland of 1,000,000 cases. There were 10,000 deaths in Liverpool,\r\na city especially prone to the disease; while in Edinburgh one person\r\nout of every nine of the population was attacked, and one out of every\r\neight of the sick died. Turning from this account to the medical\r\nreturns of the war for the Union, there were reported only 1723 cases,\r\nwith 572 deaths, to the office of the Surgeon General, and even these\r\na very competent authority after careful investigation decided not to\r\nbe instances of true typhus. Or turn to civil practice: the disease\r\nis found so seldom with us that it is not necessary to assign to it\r\na column along with the other diseases in publishing the mortality\r\nreturns by our health authorities. The deaths from fever in London\r\nduring October, November, and December, 1898, were but 296. London has\r\nan estimated population of 4,504,766, and the “fever” in the report\r\nincluded typhoid, simple and ill-defined forms of fever, as well as\r\ntyphus. This makes a death-rate of but 0.26 per 1000.\r\n\r\nHad sanitary science no other trophy, its votaries could still boast\r\nof the great benefits to humanity brought about by their labors. This\r\nis but one of many; thus, scurvy, the great bane of the navy, is now a\r\ndisease that few physicians have the misfortune to see, or patients to\r\nendure. Then that disease somewhat akin to typhus, and until within the\r\nmemory of the fathers confounded with it, hence called typhoid fever,\r\nis likewise fast disappearing, more rapidly in cities than in rural\r\ncommunities however. The suppression of typhoid proceeds with equal\r\nstep with the introduction of a public water supply in our towns, the\r\nadoption of the proper means to furnish this water unpolluted, and the\r\nproper removal of domestic waste through sewers, whose contents are\r\nso treated as to work no harm after they escape. Notwithstanding these\r\ngreat triumphs, if boasting is permissible, the sanitarian’s boast is\r\nrather that his science, which had its beginning, as we have seen, at\r\nthe time when there was a great awakening of the national conscience\r\nin British politics for “the larger sympathy of man with man,” has\r\nbroadened with the years of its growth; has endeavored to care for\r\none’s brother so that his blood would not cry up from the ground; so\r\nthat, after forty or fifty years had passed, a distinguished sanitarian\r\ncould write with literal accuracy: “Whatever can cause, or help to\r\ncause, discomfort, pain, sickness, death, vice, or crime—and whatever\r\nhas a tendency to avert or destroy, or diminish such cases—are matters\r\nof interest to the sanitarian; and the powers of science and the\r\narts, great as they are, are taxed to the uttermost to afford even an\r\napproximate solution of the problems with which he is concerned.”[1]\r\nAnd the crowning glory of the science to-day is the care it bestows\r\nupon the weak, the ignorant, and the helpless; the efforts it makes to\r\nameliorate every undesirable condition of society.\r\n\r\n    [1] Dr. J. S. Billings in _Ziemssen’s Encyclopædia_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP SHOWING “REGISTRATION STATES” NOW AVAILABLE FOR THE\r\nMORTALITY STATISTICS OF THE TWELFTH U. S. CENSUS (1900).\r\n\r\nNOTE.—States having immediate registration of deaths and requiring\r\nburial permits are _black_. The only additions to the list since the\r\nCensus of 1890 are Maine (1891) and Michigan (1897).]\r\n\r\nIt would be misleading to infer that all of these benefits have been\r\nbrought about solely through the collection of vital statistics,\r\nalthough much of it would have been difficult without the knowledge\r\nfurnished by these statistics. Workers in almost every branch of\r\npure science have contributed to the progress,—the physicist, the\r\nmeteorologist, the chemist, and by no means the least, the biologist.\r\nIndeed, with the more recent investigations, the culture tube of the\r\nbiologist has almost revolutionized medicine and all that pertains to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nSanitary science seeks to accomplish two ends; it purposes to _prevent_\r\ndisease and to _promote_ public health. If it seeks to prevent disease,\r\nafter the fashion of the oft-quoted cook-book, it must first secure the\r\ndisease, or what is essentially the same thing, know what causes it.\r\nIf the cause be known, and we can conquer the cause, we can prevent\r\nthe disease. Thus a disease known as _trichinæ spiralis_, from the\r\nname of the parasite invading the body and causing sickness and death,\r\nis caused by eating pork infected by the trichinæ. We can certainly\r\nprevent trichinæ in persons by forbidding pork; but we also know\r\nthat the trichinæ do not occur in all pork, and that their presence\r\ncan be detected by the microscope. If, then, a sample from every\r\nslaughtered pig is submitted to the microscopist, the infected pork\r\ncan be discovered. This is done in our large packing establishments,\r\nespecially for that pork which is to be exported. Again, a thorough\r\ncooking will kill the trichinæ, even if present. Only the grossest\r\ncarelessness, consequently, can account for a case of trichinæ, and,\r\nindeed, it is a very rarely occurring disease. This illustrates the\r\nimportance of a knowledge of the cause of the disease, to enable one\r\nto devise a method for preventing it. In the study of disease causes,\r\nthe biologist has been very successful during the past few years, and\r\na number of our communicable diseases are demonstrated to be caused by\r\nthe growth and development of bacteria. From this demonstration in the\r\ncase of some, a general hypothesis has been formulated, which is useful\r\nas a working hypothesis, but by no means safe to call a theory as yet.\r\nThis hypothesis is that all of our communicable diseases are caused by\r\nliving organisms originating in one person and conveyed to another,\r\nwhere they begin to grow, to reproduce their kind and to perform their\r\nlife functions. Hence all communicating diseases are infectious. Some\r\nof these infectious diseases, like measles or smallpox, are capable\r\nof direct communication from one person to another, rendering them\r\ncontagious; others, like typhoid fever and cholera, are not contagious\r\nin this sense of the word. This is a very excellent distinction to make\r\nin the use of these much abused words.\r\n\r\nThe biologist has rendered sanitary science great service not only\r\nin discovering the causes of certain diseases, but also by aiding\r\nto determine the nature of the disease in any outbreak. It makes a\r\nvast difference if a given case is one of true diphtheria or not,\r\nor of Asiatic cholera or not, and often the symptoms alone are not\r\nconclusive. Here the biologist comes to our aid, as is seen so often\r\nin cases of supposed diphtheria. A portion of the throat secretion is\r\nsent him under such precautions that no bacteria from the outside can\r\npossibly contaminate. With this secretion he stabs or inoculates a\r\njelly composition which he has placed in a test-tube, stuffs a wad of\r\nabsorbent cotton in the mouth of his tube and puts it in a warm chamber\r\nor incubator. If there are any microbes present, they will begin to\r\ngrow, and the expert biologist can tell the bacteria from its manner of\r\ngrowth as readily as the gardener can distinguish between his radishes\r\nand lettuce when they sprout in the spring, and in this way is able\r\nto report the nature of the germs. If he is in doubt, he carries his\r\ncultivation further and employs other tests to prove his observation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LABORATORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA.]\r\n\r\nThe biologist has also rendered great aid to sanitary science in\r\ndiscovering many other species of bacteria that are helpful to man. Our\r\npolluted waters could not be purified, our air could not be cleared\r\nfrom foul odors, nor the proper decomposition of organic matters go\r\non, without the aid of bacteria. These little vegetable growths, while\r\nworking much harm upon humanity, contribute far more to their comfort,\r\nwell-being, and happiness than they do to their ill. Possibly no\r\nbetter illustrations can be given of the value of bacteriology to\r\nsanitary science, and the great progress it has brought about, than\r\nto contrast a cholera outbreak of a few years ago with one occurring\r\nmore recently; or to point to the efficacy of purifying water by the\r\nassistance of bacteria. Another disease, pulmonary consumption, may\r\nalso be noticed, but the triumph here is not so marked as yet.\r\n\r\nThe first outbreak of cholera in the United States occurred in 1832.\r\nIn one special hospital in New York city, 2030 patients were received\r\nin the nine weeks from July 1 to September 1, and of these 850 died.\r\nAn eye-witness, who was personally known to the writer, one not given\r\nto exaggeration, said that the state of dread and alarm had been\r\nincreasing until, when the disease first made its appearance in New\r\nYork, fully one half of the population had left the city, many of\r\nthe physicians fleeing with the rest. There was no efficient health\r\ndepartment, and no organized system for the protection of the public\r\nhealth. This gentleman was a city missionary, and, in the performance\r\nof his duties, visited many of the houses. He mentioned visiting one\r\nof these on a morning when the fifteenth body had been carried out.\r\nIt was the time of the rumble of the dead cart and the indiscriminate\r\nburial in public trenches. Contrast the horrors of this scene with the\r\nlast attempt of cholera to invade the United States, in 1893, when,\r\nnotwithstanding its presence at the quarantine station in New York\r\nharbor, and the actual presence of a few well-authenticated cases in\r\nthe city itself, _not one of these cases proved a focus for the spread\r\nof the disease_.\r\n\r\nThe opinion that water in some way acts as a conveyer of disease can\r\nbe generalized after a very little observation. To explain how it does\r\nthis is a problem that was attempted to be solved by the chemist. He\r\nadded vastly to our knowledge, but it was not until the biologist\r\nshowed the presence of the disease-producing bacteria in water that\r\na full explanation was possible. But the biologist has done more: it\r\nhas been found, and notably in the very complete series of experiments\r\ncarried on by the Massachusetts Board of Health, that even an effluent\r\nof a sewer, if filtered through a bed of sand, is purified to such\r\nan extent that the filtrate is a perfectly safe water to drink. The\r\ndangerous organic matter disappears, and ninety-eight per cent of the\r\nbacteria is removed. And it is pleasing to note, when one has so much\r\nto say of the dangers of bacteria, that the purification is entirely\r\nbrought about by the action of bacteria working for the good of man.\r\nA sand filter bed does not purify water properly until it has been\r\nin operation for a few days, when the top of the bed is covered with\r\na slime in which the bacteria act upon the organic matter in the\r\nwater and purify it. The fact of the purification was known before\r\nthe manner in which it was done was understood; and in those cities\r\nwhere the authorities have acted upon this knowledge and have purified\r\ntheir water supply, the influence upon the death-rate of typhoid fever\r\nis almost as marked as those already quoted for typhus fever, while\r\nthe scourge of cholera has been almost entirely removed from their\r\nborders, as many an instance during the late outbreak in Europe could\r\nillustrate. It does not contribute to our self-esteem to know that most\r\nof the water supplies so filtered are to be found abroad. There is not\r\nenough of “practical politics” in filter beds to charm the traditional\r\nalderman of our cities.\r\n\r\nIt is now clearly proven that a species of bacteria is uniformly\r\npresent in pulmonary consumption. This bacillus is to be found in\r\nthe material coughed up by those who are ill with that disease. It\r\nhas considerable tenacity of life; the expectorated material can be\r\ndried, pulverized into dust, and carried about on the wind; should the\r\nbacteria so dried and carried find a proper soil, they can grow and\r\nreproduce the disease. Fortunately, a combination of circumstances\r\nis required for the contraction of this disease, or it would be far\r\nmore prevalent than it is. Notwithstanding, it already claims more\r\nvictims than any other single disease. What has sanitary science done\r\nfor its repression? It is attempting, in a tentative way, to obtain\r\na registration of those who are consumptives, in order to teach\r\nthem to avoid being possible sources of infection; to disinfect the\r\ndischarges carrying the bacteria, and at times the rooms occupied by\r\nthe consumptives. In Rome, for example, the services of the public\r\ndisinfectors are asked for as eagerly for the room occupied by a\r\nconsumptive as for one that had been used by a person suffering from\r\ndiphtheria. In New York city, where the department of health has been\r\nexercising an oversight and care over the consumptives, there has been\r\na constantly diminishing death-rate from all tubercular diseases from\r\n1886, when the rate was 4.42, to 1897, when it was 2.85, with the\r\nsingle exception of 1894, which was lower than 1895. It is too soon to\r\npredict the result, but the proper care of consumptives promises much\r\nto check the ravages of the disease.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAND FILTER BED.]\r\n\r\nOne of the charms connected with the great results indicated is the\r\nsimplicity of the methods employed to bring them about. While complex\r\nschemes and elaborate machinery may be necessary whenever the amount\r\nof service to be rendered requires organization and division of labor\r\nto properly accomplish the desired results, the principles are such\r\nthat they can be executed in the smallest hamlet, and with the very\r\ncrudest paraphernalia. The two great weapons of the sanitarian in\r\nfighting disease are isolation and disinfection. Dr. Henry M. Baker,\r\nthe efficient secretary of the State Board of Health of Michigan,\r\nhas for years collected and tabulated the results of the observing\r\nand non-observing of these precautions in his State. He has a happy\r\nfaculty for graphically presenting the results. One of his diagrams is\r\npresented here and needs no explanation. In very few of these outbreaks\r\ncould there have been any municipal disinfecting plant or isolating\r\nhospital.\r\n\r\nIsolation and disinfection—but the old quarantine and fumigation under\r\nnew names! Who of us has not sympathized with the traveler of the\r\nearlier days in the Levant, when he was condemned to days and weeks of\r\ndetention in the barren lazaretto? And even at so comparatively recent\r\na date as the pilgrimage recorded by Mark Twain in his “Innocents\r\nAbroad,” he states that the Italians found it more to their convenience\r\nto fumigate travelers than to wash themselves. How very different is a\r\nmodern quarantine station, such as may be found near any of our more\r\nimportant ports on the Atlantic coast. If the health officer of the\r\nport finds a contagious disease upon board, he immediately removes the\r\nsick to the hospital, and keeps the well under supervision long enough\r\nto see if the disease has been communicated to any. He may keep them on\r\nshipboard; but more likely, if the ship must be disinfected, he removes\r\nthem to the detention station, safely separated from the hospital. The\r\nsteerage has been crowded, and there is need of disinfection of their\r\npersons and clothing. Under proper supervision, each is required to\r\ntake a bath, for which abundant facilities are furnished; and while\r\nthis is doing their clothing has been placed in the steam disinfecting\r\napparatus, a partial vacuum secured, superheated steam introduced,\r\nthe clothing thoroughly disinfected, a partial vacuum again produced,\r\nwhereby the contents are rapidly dried, and they are ready to be put\r\non again by the time the bath is completed. The luggage is treated\r\nin the same way, while the cargo is probably treated to a sulphur\r\nfumigation,—the sulphur being burned in furnaces and the fumes carried\r\nto all parts of the cargo through lines of hose. In the course of a\r\nvery few days, at least, all but the sick can proceed on their journey\r\nwithout any risk of conveying the disease.\r\n\r\nEverything that has thus far been chronicled regarding the progress\r\nof sanitary science has related to the diminution of the death-rate\r\nand the prevention of disease. After all, is this worthy the telling?\r\nWhen one learns “how the other half lives,” or, with more restricted\r\nknowledge, realizes to a degree the intensity of the remark of a young\r\nHebrew, replying to a command of a police officer to clean up, as\r\nrelated in “The Workers” by Professor Wykoff: “You tell us we’ve got\r\nto keep clean,” he answered in broken English, lifting his voice to a\r\nshout above the clatter of machines; “what time have we to keep clean,\r\nwhen it’s all we can do to get bread? Don’t talk to us about disease;\r\nit’s _bread_ we’re after, _bread_!”\r\n\r\nIs it worthy of boasting that sanitary science is only increasing\r\nthe hardships and adding to the number of mouths to be fed, without\r\nopening up new ways to earn one’s bread? Even if it be so decided, and\r\nall the claims of progress thus far made be declared wanting, there\r\nstill remains much worthy of praise. Sanitary science strives not only\r\nto prevent disease, but also to promote health, and its progress is\r\nfully as marked in its efforts at promotion as in those of prevention,\r\nalthough we do not possess the cold figures of even imperfect vital\r\nstatistics to demonstrate the proposition.\r\n\r\nIt must be kept in mind that sanitary science is wider than sanitation\r\nin its technical sense. One would not care to assert that philanthropic\r\neffort and sweet charity are resultants of the development of sanitary\r\nscience,—very few care to assert an evident untruth. But the influence\r\nof this study has been widespread and beneficial. The whole round of\r\nsocial science is also permeated with the truths demonstrated by the\r\nsanitarian, and is likewise deeply indebted to its teachings. Our field\r\nbroadens greatly as we view it, just as one who has been traveling\r\nthrough a vale of surpassing grandeur, because of the mountain barriers\r\non either side, finds himself confronted by a park whose beauty is\r\nenhanced by its variety as well as its extent, bounded, it is true, by\r\nthe same mountains, but merely a hazy definition of the distant horizon.\r\n\r\nIn the construction of dwellings, for example, the small, low ceiled\r\nrooms, whose earthen or stone floors were covered with rushes seldom\r\nremoved, the absorbers of whatever might fall upon the floor; the\r\nunpaved, unswept, and unsewered street; the domestic water supply but a\r\nwell into which filters the water from the adjoining cesspool,—these\r\nand many similar destroyers of health and comfort can no longer be\r\nfound among nations classed as enlightened in our school geographies.\r\nEven the improvements of half a century ago—the tenements improvised\r\nout of the deserted mansions of the well-to-do, with the additions\r\nbuilt on the rear of the lot to increase the density of the\r\npopulation and the rent of the owner (as well as the death-rate),\r\nare disappearing, and in their places we find dwellings capable of\r\nfurnishing air and light to all of the residents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A QUARANTINE STATION.]\r\n\r\nThen, in the matter of streets, how much more attention is now given to\r\nsmall parks! When about the middle of the century interest in public\r\nparks was revived, the efforts of the various cities were directed to\r\nthe securing of large tracts of ground and beautifying them in every\r\nway. They were open to every one, it is true, but too often too far\r\nremoved to be of use to the submerging tenth. Now, while not adorning\r\nthese with one garland less, the effort is making to break up the\r\ncongestion of the crowded districts by breathing spaces, to the comfort\r\nand vigor of those who must make the surrounding houses their homes.\r\nThe streets, too, no longer paved with the unsightly cobble-stones,\r\nare made noiseless with the asphalt paving and, what is more to the\r\npurpose, can be easily cleansed by flushing. When practical business,\r\nand not practical politics, prevails in the municipality, there is no\r\nopportunity for the household refuse to accumulate, although no longer\r\nrushes are available to receive it, for it is regularly and promptly\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\nThe exigencies of trade compelled our government to establish its\r\nbureau for the inspection of meat. The necessity of an inspection of\r\nfoodstuffs for export demonstrates the possibility of adulteration for\r\nthe home market. While, possibly, the ingenuity of the sophisticator\r\nhas more than kept pace with the keenness of the inspector, the health\r\nof the people has been maintained, their comfort promoted, and their\r\nresources husbanded by the inspections carried on by the various city\r\nand state boards of health.\r\n\r\nThe welfare of the people at home, in their dwellings and at their\r\ntables, does not limit the efforts of the sanitarian. He takes\r\ncognizance of the daily toil, the ceaseless grind, to win one’s daily\r\nbread. He recognizes that some callings are dangerous or annoying to\r\nthe people, and devises methods to overcome this, or failing in this,\r\ninsists that such occupations must be carried on remote from the\r\ndwelling-place of man. Others, he finds, bring danger to those who are\r\nemployed. This may not be an inherent danger, but one acquired by our\r\ncrowding of operatives, or in other ways not securing to them proper\r\ncomfort; and factory inspectors are at work to reduce these dangers to\r\na minimum, and to prevent child labor as well—giving to youth, as far\r\nas cessation from overmuch toil can give, an opportunity to develop\r\ninto physical manhood or womanhood. The sanitarian insists upon proper\r\nventilation in mines, and tries to devise the means to remove the\r\ndanger from those trades that ordinarily are inherently dangerous.\r\n\r\nThe sanitarian seeks to aid in the amenities and relaxations of life\r\nas well. The playgrounds for children, the athletic grounds by the\r\nriverside at Boston, recreation piers in New York, are examples of\r\nthis. And all of these are comparatively recent efforts, adding to the\r\ncatalogue of achievements during the century. It was the arch-enemy\r\nwho, in the poem of antiquity, said: “All that a man hath will he give\r\nfor his life.” But he made the remark after much observation, and to\r\nJehovah, unto whom even he would not dare to lie; and the rolling years\r\nsince the Hebrew epic was first written have only added testimony\r\nto the truth of the assertion. In these later days, when the rule\r\nand plummet are everywhere applied, where the scientist delves and\r\nclassifies to seek the cosmos in the apparent chaos, there was evolved\r\nout of self-seeking for life a higher and better quest,—a search\r\nfor those things which make for the health of all. This search has\r\nwidened, until many a broad savannah has been trodden, many a mountain\r\nscaled and wilderness explored. With its ever extending view, new\r\nresponsibilities and greater cares have been thrust upon those who are\r\nendeavoring to rule in this domain. A community, a nation, is but a\r\nunit. Let one part suffer, and all are in pain; let one but decay, and\r\nrot is imminent everywhere. There can be no true social progress, no\r\nreal stability of government, no national prosperity worthy the name,\r\nunless the environment of each individual permits the enjoyment of\r\npersonal health, if he individually observes but the ordinary care of\r\nself. And whatever else of progress for sanitary science may be granted\r\nor denied as belonging to our century, the crowning claim of all, which\r\ncannot be taken from her, is that, along with the ideas embodied in\r\ncommonweal and commonwealth, she has added the other of equal dignity\r\nand worth—Public Health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CENTURY’S ARMIES AND ARMS\r\n\r\nBY LIEUTENANT-COLONEL ARTHUR L. WAGNER,\r\n\r\n_Assistant Adjutant General, U. S. Army_.\r\n\r\n\r\nA true appreciation of the progress made in the arts and sciences\r\nin the nineteenth century can be obtained only by contrasting the\r\nconditions found at present with those existing a hundred years ago.\r\nThe difference between the sperm candle and the electric light; between\r\nthe stage-coach and the rapid-flying express train; between the flail\r\nand the threshing machine; between the hand-loom and the machinery of\r\nthe modern woollen mill; between the cruel medical operations of five\r\nscore years ago and the skillful surgery, with the use of anæsthetics,\r\nof the present day; or between the mail-carrier with letters in his\r\nsaddle-bags and the electric telegraph flashing news instantaneously\r\nfrom continent to continent; marks the difference between the beginning\r\nof the nineteenth and the opening of the twentieth centuries.\r\n\r\nBut there is scarcely an agency that has been employed during this\r\nwonderful century for the improvement of the condition of man that has\r\nnot been enlisted for his destruction. Steam, electricity, chemical\r\nknowledge, engineering skill, and mechanical invention have all been\r\nemployed in the science of war, and everything pertaining to the\r\norganization, arms, equipment, supply, training, and even the size of\r\narmies, has been so revolutionized that there is scarcely anything in\r\ncommon between the forces that fought at Marengo and those employed in\r\nrecent wars, except the characteristic of being armed and organized\r\nbodies of soldiers under military leadership.\r\n\r\nThe nineteenth century was born in the midst of war. All Europe was\r\nan armed camp, and the contest between the principles of the French\r\nRevolution and the old feudal system had taken the form of actual\r\nstrife upon the field of battle. A great alteration was taking place in\r\nthe methods of war; the old pedantic strategy of the Austrian school\r\nhad already received a rude shock at the hands of the brilliant young\r\nBonaparte, and the old tactical methods bequeathed by Frederick the\r\nGreat were, also, soon to be shattered by the genius of the newer and\r\ngreater warrior. To appreciate the changes that were already being made\r\nin military methods, a brief glance at the organization of the armed\r\nforces in the latter part of the eighteenth century is necessary. The\r\nPrussian army, as organized by the great Frederick, was regarded as the\r\nfinest of the time. In it the most exact and machine-like methods were\r\nobserved, the most careful accuracy in marching was required, drill was\r\ncarried to mechanical perfection, volley firing was conducted with the\r\ngreatest precision, and no skirmishers were employed. In comparison\r\nwith later methods, the whole system may be characterized as exact,\r\nmethodical, and slow. Armies were supplied entirely from magazines, by\r\nmeans of long and cumbrous trains, and the art of moving rapidly and\r\nsubsisting on the country was still to be discovered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD STYLE SHRAPNEL.]\r\n\r\nThe French army produced by the Revolution, and led by such men as\r\nDugommier, Hoche, Moreau, and Bonaparte, was trained to operate\r\nin column, to deploy quickly into line, and generally to act with\r\ncelerity; while the impoverished treasury of the republic compelled its\r\narmies to live entirely upon the country in which they were operating,\r\nas the only alternative to starvation. This entailed serious hardships\r\nto the soldiers, and great distress to the population of the country\r\nin which they were acting, but it marked distinctly the beginning of a\r\nnew system of supply, which contributed greatly to the rapid movement\r\nof armies. The French army, at the beginning of the century, contained\r\nno regiments, but was organized into demi-brigades, each of which\r\nconsisted of four battalions, each comprising ten companies, two of\r\nwhich were trained to act as skirmishers. These demi-brigades, with\r\none or more batteries of artillery, constituted a division, to which a\r\nsmall force of cavalry was generally added. In 1805 Napoleon, then the\r\nsupreme ruler of France, made important changes in the organization of\r\nthe army. The demi-brigade was replaced by the two battalion regiments,\r\neach regiment now consisting of eight companies. Two regiments formed a\r\nbrigade, and two brigades and a regiment of light infantry constituted\r\na division. On the light regiment devolved the duties of skirmishers;\r\nnamely, to harass and develop the enemy before the main attack. The\r\ndivisions were grouped into larger organizations known as _corps\r\nd’armée_, or army corps, each of which consisted of all arms of the\r\nservice, and was, in fact, a force capable of operating independently\r\nas a small army.[2] A corps of reserve cavalry was also formed. In\r\nnumbers the cavalry was equal to one fourth, and the artillery one\r\neighth of the strength of the infantry. The infantry was armed with a\r\nsmooth-bore, muzzle-loading, flint-lock musket, which required some\r\nthirty-two distinct motions in loading, and which had an effective\r\nrange of only two hundred yards, though by giving it a high elevation\r\nit could do some damage at twice that distance. This weapon bore about\r\nthe same relation to the magazine rifle of the present day that the\r\nold-fashioned sickle bears to the modern mowing-machine. The artillery\r\nconsisted of muzzle-loading, smooth-bore guns, which had less than\r\none fourth the range of the modern infantry rifle. Cavalry, being\r\nable to form with comparative impunity within close proximity of the\r\nopposing infantry, could sweep down upon it in a headlong charge; and\r\nthe use of the sabre on the field of battle, now so rare, was then an\r\nalmost invariable feature of every conflict. Under Napoleon the armies\r\ncontinued to “live on the country,” but magazines of supplies were\r\ncarefully prepared to supplement the exhausted resources of the theatre\r\nof war.\r\n\r\n    [2] Brigades and divisions had long existed, but the army corps\r\n        was a creation of Napoleon.\r\n\r\nIn besieging a fortified place, the first parallel or line of batteries\r\nof the besiegers was habitually established at about six hundred yards\r\nfrom the enemy’s works, a distance then at long artillery range, but\r\nwhich would now be under an annihilating fire from infantry rifles. The\r\ncannon used solid shot almost exclusively, though early in the present\r\ncentury a projectile, invented by Lieutenant Shrapnel, of the British\r\narmy, and which now universally bears his name, was introduced. This\r\nconsisted of a thin cast-iron shell filled with round musket balls, the\r\ninterstices between which were filled by pouring in melted sulphur or\r\nresin, to solidify the mass and prevent it from cracking the shell when\r\nthe piece was fired. A hole was bored through the mass of sulphur and\r\nbullets to receive the bursting charge, which was just sufficient to\r\nrupture the shell and release the bullets, which then moved with the\r\nvelocity that the projectile had at the moment of bursting. Shrapnel\r\nhas at all times been a destructive missile, though in its early form\r\nit was insignificant in comparison with the “man-killing projectile”\r\nwhich now bears the same designation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CONGREVE ROCKET.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1806, the Congreve rocket was added to the weapons of war.\r\nIt consisted of a case of wrought iron, filled with a composition of\r\nnitre, charcoal, and sulphur, in such proportions as to burn more\r\nslowly than gunpowder. The head of the rocket consisted of a solid\r\nshot, a shell, or a shrapnel. At the base was fastened a stick, which\r\nsecured steadiness for the projectile in its flight. The range of the\r\nrocket was scarcely more than five hundred yards, though a subsequent\r\nimprovement, which dispensed with the guide-stick and substituted three\r\ntangential vents, increased the range very considerably. Congreve\r\nrockets were used with effect in Europe in 1814, and against our raw\r\nmilitia at Bladensburg in the same year. They seem, however, to have\r\ndepended more upon the moral effect of their hissing rush than upon any\r\nreally destructive properties, and were effective mainly against raw\r\ntroops and cavalry. The rocket is now an obsolete weapon, having made\r\nits last appearance in war in the Austrian army in 1866.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: U. S. RIFLE MUSKET, 1855.]\r\n\r\nThe infantry of all the armies of Continental Europe, when deployed\r\nfor battle, was formed in three ranks. On the eve of the battle of\r\nLeipsic, Napoleon, finding himself greatly outnumbered by the allies,\r\nordered his infantry to deploy in two ranks, in order that his front\r\nmight approximate in length to that of the enemy. This formation had,\r\nhowever, been adopted by the British some years before, and had been\r\nused with great success against the assaulting French columns, in many\r\nof Wellington’s battles in Spain, where the steadfast Anglo-Saxon\r\nsoldiery was able to maintain the “thin red line,” and throw the\r\nfire of every musket against the denser formation of its foes. It\r\nwas not until the British troops encountered, upon our own soil, an\r\nAnglo-Saxon opponent as steadfast as themselves, and better skilled\r\nin marksmanship, that they were unable to achieve a victory over\r\ntheir enemies. True, our raw militia was everywhere beaten when it\r\nencountered the disciplined soldiers of Great Britain, but our regular\r\ntroops at Chippewa and Lundy’s Lane gallantly defeated the choice\r\nveterans of Wellington’s campaigns; and, at New Orleans, an army\r\ncomposed mainly of hardy backwoodsmen, trained in Indian lighting, and\r\nexpert in the use of the rifle, hurled back, with frightful carnage,\r\nexperienced British soldiers who had habitually triumphed over the best\r\nveterans of the French empire.\r\n\r\nThe battle of New Orleans marked the introduction of the rifle as a\r\nformidable arm for infantry. It was by no means a new weapon, for it\r\nhad been invented in Germany in 1498; but it had not been used to any\r\nextent in military service, mainly because of the slowness of loading.\r\nThe capabilities of the rifle in the hands of an army of expert\r\nmarksmen were, however, made so manifest by Jackson’s great victory\r\nthat the attention of military men was turned towards the weapon which\r\nhad enabled a crude army to overwhelm the choicest troops of Europe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MINIÉ BALL.]\r\n\r\nYet it was not until 1850 that a practically efficient military rifle\r\nappeared. This was the invention of Captain Minié, of the French army,\r\nand was the well-known “Minié rifle,” long familiar to troops on both\r\ncontinents. The weapon was a muzzle-loader, and its projectile, the\r\n“Minié ball,” was of a conoidal shape, as shown in the accompanying\r\nfigure. The ball being slightly smaller in diameter than the bore of\r\nthe piece, the loading was easily accomplished, and the shock of the\r\nexplosion against the cavity at the base of the bullet forced the lead\r\ninto the grooves of the bore and caused the shot to take up a rotary\r\nmotion on its axis—in other words, “to take the rifling.”\r\n\r\nRifles, mostly constructed on principles similar to those on which\r\nMinié’s weapon was based, were soon in use in the armies of all great\r\nnations. The rifle musket, “model of 1855,” adopted by the United\r\nStates, is shown in the accompanying figure.\r\n\r\nIn 1817 percussion caps were invented in the United States, but some\r\ntime elapsed before they were introduced into military use; and though\r\nthe “percussion rifle” was known in 1841, the victorious troops which\r\nwent with Scott in the brilliant campaign from Vera Cruz to the City\r\nof Mexico, six years later, were armed with the flint-lock musket. In\r\n1833, Colonel Colt invented the first practical revolving pistol. This\r\nweapon, especially in its present perfected form, is so well known as\r\nto need no description. The first pattern of Colt’s revolver used paper\r\ncartridges and percussion caps.\r\n\r\nIn the long period of peace which Europe enjoyed after the battle\r\nof Waterloo, but little change was made in the organization of the\r\narmies of the great powers; and in the Crimean war (1855–56) the\r\ncomposition of the English, French, and Russian armies did not differ\r\nmaterially from the constitution of the forces of the same nations\r\nin the Napoleonic wars. Marked changes had, however, been made in the\r\nnature of the weapons; most of the English and a part of the French\r\ninfantry being armed with the rifle, though the Russian infantry,\r\nwith the exception of a few selected regiments, were still armed with\r\nthe smooth-bore musket. Though the extreme range of the rifle at this\r\ntime did not exceed eight hundred yards, and was inaccurate at half\r\nthat distance, it was, nevertheless, a formidable weapon in comparison\r\nwith the infantry musket of Napoleonic times. Rifled siege guns were\r\nemployed by the British at Sebastopol, but they were not a success,\r\nand were soon withdrawn from the batteries. A striking indication of\r\nthe increased range of artillery was furnished at Sebastopol, when the\r\nbesiegers established their first parallel at a distance of 1300 yards\r\nfrom the Russian works.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARMSTRONG FIELD GUN.]\r\n\r\nIn the Italian war of 1859 rifled cannon appeared for the first time\r\nupon the field of battle. They were employed by the French, and to\r\ntheir use was largely due the victories of the French and Sardinians\r\nover the Austrians. For many years the attention of artillerists had\r\nbeen devoted to the production of serviceable rifled artillery, and as\r\nearly as 1846 an iron breech-loading rifled cannon had been invented\r\nin France by Major Cavalli. This gun fired a shell not dissimilar in\r\nshape to the projectile employed in the Minié rifled musket. In 1854,\r\nexperiments with a Cavalli gun gave very satisfactory results, both in\r\nrange and accuracy; but the breech mechanism seemed dangerously weak,\r\nand the rifled guns, adopted by the French and used with such effect in\r\nItaly, were muzzle-loaders.\r\n\r\nIn 1854 a breech-loading rifled field-piece was invented by Sir William\r\nGeorge Armstrong. It was made of wrought-iron bars coiled into spiral\r\ntubes, and welded by forging. The breech was closed with a screw which\r\ncould be quickly withdrawn for loading and sponging the gun. The\r\nprojectile was made of cast-iron, thinly coated with lead, and was\r\n(with its coating) slightly larger in diameter than the bore. The lead\r\ncoating was crushed into the grooves by the force of the powder, the\r\nnecessary rotation being thus given to the projectile. This gun gave\r\nexcellent results in range and in rapidity and accuracy of fire, but\r\nit was not until some years after its invention that it was adopted in\r\nthe British service. Other breech-loading cannon soon appeared; but\r\nin the United States army the 3-inch Rodman muzzle-loading rifled gun\r\nwas preferred to any breech-loader then devised, and was used with\r\ngreat effect throughout the War of Secession. This gun was made by\r\nwrapping boiler plate around an iron bar, so as to form a cylindrical\r\nmass, the whole being brought to a welding heat in a furnace and then\r\npassed through rollers to unite it solidly. The piece was then bored\r\nand turned to the proper shape and dimensions. The projectiles for\r\nrifled guns were generally coated with soft metal, or furnished with\r\nan expanding base or cup of similar metal or _papier maché_; though in\r\nsome systems they were furnished with studs or buttons which fitted\r\ninto the grooves of the bore. In the case of the Whitworth gun, the\r\nprojectile was made nearly of the exact size and form of the bore, so\r\nas to fit accurately into the grooves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RODMAN GUN.]\r\n\r\nBreech-loading cannon were not, however, quickly adopted, owing,\r\nperhaps, to conservatism on the part of artillerists, and partly\r\nbecause the guns first produced did not seem to give appreciably\r\nbetter results in range, accuracy, or even in rapidity of fire than\r\nthe muzzle-loaders. Not only were breech-loading cannon adopted with\r\nseeming reluctance, but rifled cannon generally were looked upon with\r\ndisfavor by many artillerists of the old school. Hohenlohe tells of an\r\nold Prussian general of artillery who was so prejudiced against the\r\nrifled innovation that he requested, on his death-bed, that the salute\r\nover his grave should be fired with nothing but smooth-bore guns. It\r\nmust be confessed, however, that the 12-pound smooth-bore Napoleon gun\r\nlong held its own against the new rifled field-pieces, as many a bloody\r\nbattle in our Civil War well attested.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL WINFIELD SCOTT.]\r\n\r\nIn the manufacture of heavy guns the United States for some time\r\nled the world. In 1860, General Rodman, of the Ordnance Department,\r\nproduced the first 15-inch gun ever made. This gun was made of\r\ncast-iron, and was cast on a hollow core, cooled by a stream of water\r\npassing through it, by which means the metal nearest the bore was\r\nmade the hardest and most dense, and the tendency towards bursting\r\nwas thus reduced to a minimum. General Rodman was also the inventor\r\nof the hollow cake powder, which consisted of cakes perforated with\r\nnumerous small holes for the passage of the flame, thus enabling the\r\npowder to be progressively consumed, and causing the amount of gas at\r\nthe last moments of the discharge to be greater than at the instant\r\nof ignition. A large-grain powder, known as “mammoth powder,” was\r\nafterwards devised by him to produce the same results. It will be seen\r\nlater that this invention has rendered possible the powerful ordnance\r\nof the present day; and it is perhaps not too much to say, that Rodman\r\nis really thus the father of the modern high-power guns.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the War of Secession the heaviest gun in the\r\nUnited States was the 15-inch Rodman, the projectile of which weighed\r\n320 lbs., the charge of powder weighing 35 lbs. Next to this was the\r\n10-inch Columbiad, which fired a 100-lb. shell with a charge of 18\r\nlbs. of powder. The effective range of these guns was a little less\r\nthan three miles. The heaviest mortar was of 13-inch caliber, fired a\r\n200-lb. shell, with a charge of 20 lbs. of powder, and had a range of\r\n4325 yards. This mortar was, like all others then in use, manipulated\r\nby means of handspikes, and not only was much less powerful, but was\r\nmuch more clumsy than the admirable mortar of the present day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD SMOOTH-BORE MORTAR.]\r\n\r\nThe Crimean and Italian wars had foreshadowed the passing away of the\r\nold military conditions and the dawning of a new era of warfare. But\r\nit was in the gigantic struggle which rocked our own country for four\r\nyears that the developments of modern warfare really commenced. At the\r\nbeginning of this great conflict the ranges of 1000 to 1200 yards for\r\nfield guns, and of 1500 to 2000 yards for heavy guns, were as great\r\nas could be secured with any degree of accuracy. The infantry rifle\r\nwith which the Union and Confederate armies were armed had an extreme\r\nrange of but 1000 yards, and a really effective range of only half that\r\ndistance. The rifle was a muzzle-loader, which required nine distinct\r\nmotions in loading besides those necessary in priming the piece with\r\nthe percussion cap then used. The tactics employed at first in all arms\r\nof the service did not differ materially from the methods employed\r\nin the Napoleonic wars; and a line of American infantry deployed\r\nfor battle in two ranks, shoulder to shoulder, scarcely differed in\r\nanything but the color of its uniforms from the “thin red line” of\r\nWellington’s warriors. All this was to be changed; but it was not only\r\nin the matter of arms and tactics that a revolution was to be effected,\r\nfor new forces hitherto untried were to be employed in the art of war.\r\n\r\nThe War of Secession was not only one of the most gigantic conflicts\r\never waged on earth, but was one which will always be of interest to\r\nthe military student because of its remarkable developments in the\r\nscience of warfare, and one which will ever be a source of pride to\r\nAmericans because of the grim earnestness and stubborn valor displayed\r\nby the contending armies. From first to last, more than two millions\r\nof men were enrolled by the United States, and in the final campaign\r\n1,100,000 men were actually bearing arms in the service of the\r\nUnion. The infantry was organized in companies of one hundred men,\r\nten companies forming a regiment. At first, three or four regiments\r\nconstituted a brigade, though it was afterwards formed of a greater\r\nnumber when the regiments became depleted by the losses of battle.\r\nThree brigades generally composed a division, which also habitually\r\nincluded two batteries of artillery and a small detachment of cavalry\r\nfor duty as orderlies and messengers. Three or more divisions\r\nconstituted an army corps. The cavalry was formed into brigades and\r\ndivisions, which in the later years of the war were combined to form,\r\nin each of the large armies, a corps of cavalry. It was in command of\r\nsuch corps of mounted troops that Sheridan, J. E. B. Stuart, Merritt,\r\nand Wilson achieved their great fame. The batteries first distributed\r\nto divisions, or even brigades, were afterwards assigned to the army\r\ncorps, and all guns not thus employed were grouped into a corps of\r\nreserve artillery.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that the two factors most important in warfare\r\nwere found to be two inventions designed primarily for the interests\r\nof peace, namely, the railroad and the electric telegraph. Steam and\r\nelectricity had both been used in the Crimean and Italian wars; but\r\nit was in the War of Secession that they received their first great\r\nand systematic application. The effect of the use of railroads in\r\nwar not only enables armies to be more rapidly concentrated than was\r\nformerly the case, but renders it possible to supply them to an extent\r\nand with a certainty that would otherwise be out of the question. The\r\ndifference between the supply of an army by wagon and by rail was\r\nclearly shown in the siege of Paris, in 1870–71, where six trains a\r\nday fed the whole besieging army, while it is estimated that nearly\r\nten thousand wagons would have been required for the same purpose.\r\nMoreover, the force of troops necessarily detached to protect a line\r\nof railroad communications is not nearly so great as the force that\r\nwould be necessary to guard the innumerable wagon or pack trains that\r\nwould otherwise be required. In the opinion of the best military\r\nauthorities, railroads, had they been in existence, would have enabled\r\nNapoleon to conquer Russia, and with it the world; while, without the\r\naid of railroads, the successful invasion of the South by the armies of\r\nthe Union would have been an impossibility. It is only while it keeps\r\nmoving that an army can “live on the country.” It is like a swarm of\r\nlocusts, consuming everything within reach; and if it be compelled\r\nto halt, whether for battle or from other cause, it must be supplied\r\nfrom bases in the rear, or it will speedily disintegrate from hunger\r\nalone. This fact was fully appreciated by General Sherman, when he left\r\nAtlanta in his famous “march to the sea;” for though he expected to,\r\nand did, live upon the country, he nevertheless took the precaution to\r\ncarry with him a wagon train containing twenty days’ rations for his\r\nentire army.\r\n\r\nIn the War of Secession the electric telegraph first appeared on\r\nthe field of battle. The telegraph train became a prominent feature\r\nof all our armies; and the day’s march was hardly ended before the\r\nelectric wire, rapidly established by an expert corps, connected the\r\nheadquarters of the army with those of each army corps, division,\r\nand brigade. But it was not in its employment on the actual field of\r\nbattle that the telegraph found its most valuable military use. It\r\nenabled generals, separated by hundreds of miles, to be in constant\r\ncommunication with each other, and rendered it possible for Grant to\r\ncontrol from his headquarters hut at City Point the movements of the\r\narmies of Sherman, Thomas, and Sheridan in combined operations, which\r\nenabled each to perform, in harmony with the others, its part in the\r\nmighty plan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPENCER CARBINE.]\r\n\r\nIt followed as naturally as day follows night that a shrewd\r\nand intelligent people, engaged in a desperate struggle for\r\nself-preservation, would avail themselves of all means provided by\r\nmilitary science for carrying out the contest in which they were\r\nengaged. Iron-clad vessels had been devised in both England and\r\nFrance, but they were merely frigates designed on the old lines and\r\npartly covered with a sheathing of armor. With characteristic energy\r\nand ingenuity the Americans, ignoring old traditions and seeking\r\nthe shortest road to the fulfillment of a manifest want, produced\r\nsimultaneously the Merrimac and the Monitor, the former resembling\r\n“a gabled house submerged to the eaves,” and the latter looking like\r\n“a Yankee cheese-box upon a raft.” These novel vessels met in their\r\nmemorable combat at Hampton Roads, and the booming of their guns\r\nsounded the death knell of the old wooden navies.\r\n\r\nAs with war vessels, so with firearms. New conditions were met with\r\ninventive genius and mechanical skill. Though the great mass of our\r\ntroops continued throughout the conflict to use the muzzle-loading\r\nrifle, breech-loaders were in the hands of many thousands of our\r\nsoldiers before the close of the great contest. In 1864 the cavalry\r\nof Sheridan and Wilson and many regiments of infantry were armed with\r\nbreech-loading carbines, which gave them a great advantage over their\r\nopponents. The effect of the breech-loaders upon the Confederates was\r\nunpleasantly surprising to them, and the Southern soldiers are said to\r\nhave remarked with dismal humor that “the Yankees loaded all night and\r\nfired all day.”\r\n\r\nThe principal breech-loading arms in use in the Union armies were the\r\nSharps and the Spencer. In the Sharps carbine the barrel was closed\r\nby a sliding breech-piece which moved at right angles with the axis\r\nof the piece, the breech being opened and closed by pulling down and\r\nraising up the trigger-guard. The Spencer carbine was a magazine\r\nrifle, and was greatly superior to the Sharps. The magazine of the\r\nrifle lay in the butt of the stock, and was capable of holding seven\r\ncartridges. As the cartridge was fired and ejected another was pushed\r\nforward into the breech by a spiral spring in the butt of the piece.\r\nThe Spencer carbine used metallic cartridges. The introduction of these\r\ncartridges was one of the most remarkable advances in the art of war\r\nmade during the present century. The cartridge in use in 1864–65 is\r\nshown in the accompanying figure; it consisted of a thin copper case\r\nfirmly attached to the bullet containing the powder, and having at\r\nits base a small metallic anvil, in a cavity of which was placed the\r\nfulminate, which was exploded by means of a firing pin, driven in by\r\na blow of the hammer. The advantages of the metallic cartridge can\r\nscarcely be overestimated; it rendered obsolete the percussion cap, and\r\nbeing water-proof it did away with the ever-present bugbear of damp\r\nammunition. The old injunction, “Put your trust in God and keep your\r\npowder dry,” has consequently lost much of its force; for while it is\r\nto be hoped that the soldier will continue to place his reliance upon\r\nProvidence, the latter part of the advice can now be safely ignored.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: METALLIC CARTRIDGE OF 1864–65.]\r\n\r\nAmong the many advantages possessed by the breech-loader over the\r\nmuzzle-loader, the principal ones are greater rapidity of fire, ease\r\nof loading in any position, diminished danger of accidents in loading,\r\nand the impossibility of putting more than one charge in the piece at\r\nthe same time. This last advantage is by no means slight. Among 27,000\r\nmuzzle-loading muskets picked up on the battlefield of Gettysburg, at\r\nleast 24,000 were loaded. Of these about half contained two charges,\r\none fourth held from three to ten charges, and one musket contained\r\ntwenty-three cartridges.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the Americans to produce during the great war a\r\npractical breech-loading field-gun is doubtless due to the fact\r\nthat the field artillery in use at that time answered fully all the\r\nrequirements then existing. Owing to the nature of the country in which\r\nthe armies were operating, the range of the 3-inch rifled gun was fully\r\nas great as could have been desired; and on the broken and wooded\r\nground which generally formed our field of battle, the smooth-bore\r\nNapoleon gun, firing shrapnel and canister, seemed to have reached\r\nalmost the acme of destructiveness. Moreover, the muzzle-loading\r\ncannon, both rifled and smooth-bore, were served with such celerity\r\nas to make it a matter of doubt for some years after whether the\r\nintroduction of breech-loading field-guns would materially increase\r\nthe rapidity of fire. It was not until infantry fire had greatly\r\nincreased in range and rapidity that a further improvement in field\r\nartillery became necessary. In siege artillery, heavy rifled guns of\r\nthe Rodman and the Parrott type appeared. The Parrott gun was of cast\r\niron, strengthened by shrinking a coiled band of wrought iron over the\r\nportion of the piece surrounding the charge. The famous “Swamp Angel,”\r\nused in the siege of Charleston, was a Parrott gun. The sea-coast\r\nartillery consisted mainly of smooth-bores of large calibre, which\r\nwere able to contend successfully with any armor then afloat. It is a\r\ncurious fact that the war, so to speak, between guns and armor has been\r\nincessantly waged since the introduction of the latter, every advance\r\nof armor towards the degree of invulnerability being met with the\r\nproduction of a gun capable of piercing it. The sea-coast artillery of\r\nthe United States in the Civil War met fully every demand to which it\r\nwas subjected.\r\n\r\nThe War of Secession produced the first practical machine-gun,—the\r\nGatling,—though such guns were not used to any extent. The machine-gun\r\nhas, in fact, passed through a long period of gestation, and it is\r\nonly in recent years that it can be said to have attained its full\r\nbirth. Our great war was also noted for the introduction of torpedoes.\r\nThese peculiar weapons had, it is true, been devised may years before;\r\nand Robert Fulton had, in the early part of the century, devoted his\r\ninventive genius to the production of a submarine torpedo, which,\r\nhowever, was never practically tested in war. It was not until the\r\ncontest of 1861–65 that torpedoes were of any practical use. The high\r\nexplosives of the present day being then unknown, these torpedoes\r\ndepended for their destructive force upon gunpowder alone. Yet crude\r\nand insignificant though they were in comparison with the mighty\r\nengines of destruction now known by the same name, they accomplished\r\ngreat results in more than one instance. The destruction of the\r\nHousatonic off Charleston, the sinking of the Tecumseh in Mobile Bay,\r\nand Cushing’s daring destruction of the Albemarle, gave notice to the\r\nworld that a new and terrible engine of warfare had made its appearance.\r\n\r\nBut it was not merely by the production of new weapons that the\r\ngreat American war was characterized. It marked the turning-point\r\nin tactics as well. The first efforts of our great armies of raw\r\nvolunteers were as crude as the warfare of untrained troops always is,\r\nand it was fortunate that we were opposed to a foe as unpracticed as\r\nourselves; but as the troops gained experience in war, acquired the\r\nnecessary military instruction,—in brief, learned their trade and\r\nbecame regulars in all but name,—they displayed not only a steadfast\r\nprowess, but a military skill that placed the veteran American soldier\r\nat the head of the warriors of the world. The art of constructing\r\nhasty intrenchments on the field of battle grew out of the quickness\r\nof the American soldier to appreciate the necessity of providing\r\ndefensive means to neutralize, in some degree, the greatly increased\r\ndestructive effect of improved arms. In this respect he was thirteen\r\nyears in advance of the European soldier, for hasty intrenchments did\r\nnot appear in Europe until the Turco-Russian War. True, intrenchment on\r\nthe field of battle was as old as war itself; but the American armies\r\nwere the first that developed a system of quickly covering the entire\r\nfront of an army with earthworks hastily thrown up in the presence of\r\nthe enemy, and often actually under fire. Skirmishers were no longer\r\nused merely to feel and develop the enemy; but in many of our battles,\r\nnotably in Sherman’s campaign in Georgia, the engagement was begun, and\r\nfought to the end, by strong skirmish lines successively reinforced\r\nfrom the main body, which they gradually absorbed in the course of the\r\naction. Here, too, the American soldier was fully six years in advance\r\nof the European warrior; for it was not until the Germans had been\r\nwarned by the terrific losses incurred in their earlier battles with\r\nthe French, in 1870, that they evolved from their own experience a\r\nsystem of tactics, the essential principles of which had already been\r\ndemonstrated on the Western Continent.\r\n\r\nThe increased range of artillery again received a practical\r\nillustration; for at the siege of Fort Pulaski the Union batteries\r\nfirst opened fire at ranges varying from 1650 to 3400 yards from the\r\nConfederate fort. At the siege of Charleston shells were thrown into\r\nthe city from a battery nearly five miles distant.\r\n\r\nIn 1866, the brief but bloody war between Austria and Prussia suddenly\r\nraised the latter nation from a comparatively subordinate position\r\nto the front rank of military powers. The greatness of Prussia was\r\nborn in the sackcloth and ashes of national humiliation. Forbidden by\r\nNapoleon, after her crushing defeat in 1806–7, to maintain an army of\r\nmore than 40,000 men, her great war minister, Scharnhorst, conceived\r\nthe plan of discharging the soldiers from military service as soon as\r\nthey had received the requisite instruction, and filling their places\r\nwith recruits. In this way, though the standing army never exceeded\r\nthe stipulated number, many thousands of Prussians received military\r\ntraining; and when Prussia declared war against Napoleon, after his\r\ndisastrous Russian campaign, the discharged men were called back into\r\nthe ranks, and there arose as if by magic a formidable Prussian army\r\nof trained soldiers. The principle of universal military service, thus\r\ncalled into existence in Prussia in time of war, had been continued\r\nthrough fifty years of peace, and enabled Prussia, with a population\r\nscarcely more than half as numerous as that of Austria, to place\r\nupon the decisive field of Königgrätz a larger army than that of her\r\nopponent.\r\n\r\nThe Prussian system, which has since been copied by all the great\r\nmilitary nations of Europe, is, in its essential features, as follows:\r\nEvery able-bodied man in the kingdom, upon reaching the age of\r\ntwenty years, is available for military service; and each year there\r\nare chosen by lot sufficient recruits to maintain the army at its\r\nauthorized strength. The great body of the male population is thus\r\nbrought into military service. There are a few exceptions, such as the\r\nonly sons of indigent parents, and a small number of men who are in\r\nexcess of the force required. Any man who escapes the draft for three\r\nsuccessive years, and all able-bodied men exempted for any cause from\r\nservice in the regular army, are incorporated in the reserve. The term\r\nof service in the regular army is two years for the infantry and three\r\nfor the artillery and cavalry. After being discharged from the regular\r\narmy the soldier passes into the reserve, where he serves for four\r\nyears. While in the reserve, he is called out for two field exercises\r\nof eight weeks’ duration each, and the rest of his time is available\r\nfor his civil vocation. At the end of four years in the reserve he\r\npasses into the Landwehr, in which he is required to participate in\r\nonly two field exercises of two weeks’ duration each. After five years\r\nin the Landwehr proper, he passes into the second levy of the Landwehr,\r\nwhere he is free from all military duty in time of peace, though still\r\nliable to be called to arms in case of war. From the second levy of\r\nthe Landwehr he passes, at the age of thirty-nine years, into the\r\nLandsturm, where he remains until he reaches his forty-fifth year,\r\nwhen he is finally discharged from military duty. The soldier in the\r\nLandsturm is practically free from all military duty, for that body is\r\nnever called out except in case of dire national emergency. By this\r\nsystem Prussia became not only a military power but “a nation in arms,”\r\nin the blaze of whose might the military glory of Austria and of France\r\nsuccessively melted away in humiliating defeat.\r\n\r\nThe careful military preparation of Prussia in time of peace was by\r\nno means limited to measures for providing an army strong in numbers.\r\nEvery year her troops were assembled in large bodies for practice\r\nin the manœuvres of the battlefield. This mimicry of war, at first\r\nlightly regarded by the military leaders of the other European nations,\r\nproduced such wonderful effects in promoting the efficiency of the army\r\nthat it has since been copied in all the armies of Europe, and is now\r\nregarded as the most important of all instruction for war.\r\n\r\nThough breech-loading rifles were, as we have seen, used in the War of\r\nSecession, the Prussian army was the first that ever took the field\r\ncompletely armed with such weapons. The Prussian rifle was not new,\r\nfor it had been invented by a Thuringian gunsmith, named Dreyse, about\r\nthe time that the Minié rifle appeared. Dreyse’s arm was known as the\r\n“zundnadelgewehr,” or needle-gun, and its effect in the Austro-Prussian\r\nwar was so decisive and startling as to cause muzzle-loading rifles\r\neverywhere to be relegated to the limbo of obsolete weapons. Yet\r\nthe needle-gun was but a sorry weapon in comparison to those now in\r\nuse, and was distinctly inferior to the Spencer carbine. Its breech\r\nmechanism was clumsy, it used a paper cartridge, it was not accurate\r\nbeyond a range of three hundred yards, and its effective range was\r\nscarcely more than twice that distance. The German infantry fought in\r\nthree ranks, and its tactics was not equal to that employed by the\r\nAmerican infantry in the War of Secession. The Prussian field artillery\r\nwas the most formidable that had yet appeared, and consisted mainly\r\nof steel breech-loading rifled guns, which were classed as 6-pounders\r\nand 4-pounders, though the larger piece fired a shell weighing fifteen\r\npounds, and the smaller projectile used a shell weighing nine pounds.\r\nIn the Austrian army the infantry was armed with a muzzle-loading\r\nrifle, and the artillery consisted entirely of muzzle-loading rifled\r\nguns.\r\n\r\nThe exalted military prestige gained by Prussia rendered it certain\r\nthat she must soon enter the lists in a contest with France, whose\r\ncommanding position in Europe was so seriously menaced by the rise\r\nof the new power. Foreseeing the inevitable conflict, Napoleon III.\r\nendeavored to prepare for a serious struggle. The French infantry\r\nwas armed with the Chassepôt rifle, which had an effective range\r\nnearly double that of the needle-gun. A machine gun, known as the\r\n_mitrailleuse_, was also introduced into the French army. Much was\r\nexpected of these new arms; but so superior was the organization,\r\nreadiness, generalship, and tactical skill of the Prussians that the\r\nwar was a practically unbroken series of victories for Prussia and the\r\nallied German States. Profiting by their experience in the course of\r\nthe conflict, the Prussians formed their infantry for attack in three\r\nlines; the first consisting of skirmishers, the second of supports,\r\neither deployed or in small columns, and the third of a reserve,\r\ngenerally held in column until it came under such fire as to render\r\ndeployment necessary. The skirmishers were constantly reinforced from\r\nthe supports, and finally from the reserve as the attack progressed,\r\nthe whole force being united in a heavy line, and opening the hottest\r\npossible fire when close enough to the enemy for the final charge.\r\nIn its essential principles this attack formation is in use at the\r\npresent day in the armies of all civilized nations. The Prussian\r\nartillery was handled with terrible effect both in battle and siege. A\r\nnew demonstration of the increased power of artillery was given in the\r\nsiege of Paris, in which shells were thrown from the heights of Clamart\r\nto the Panthéon, a distance of five miles.\r\n\r\nThe next European war was the contest between Russia and Turkey, in\r\n1877. In this conflict the American system of hasty intrenchments was\r\nused with success by the Turks, who were also armed with an American\r\nrifle, the Peabody, which enabled them to inflict serious losses upon\r\nthe Russians at a range of a mile and a quarter. Owing to the Turkish\r\nintrenchments and the inferiority of their own arms, the Russians won\r\ntheir victories over much smaller armies only with a gruesome loss of\r\nlife. A further impetus was given to the development of the infantry\r\nrifle, and the German tactical experience was confirmed by the Russian\r\nGeneral Skobeleff in the declaration that infantry can successfully\r\nassault only in a succession of skirmish lines.\r\n\r\nThe war in Turkey was the last great European conflict. Subsequent\r\ncampaigns of the Russians in Central Asia, of the English in Egypt, the\r\nSoudan, and India, of the Japanese in China, of the Turks in Greece,\r\nand the Americans in Cuba, have emphasized the lessons already taught,\r\nand demonstrated the increased power of new weapons.\r\n\r\nHaving taken a retrospective view of the military forces and weapons\r\nemployed in the wars of the nineteenth century, let us now turn\r\nto a consideration of the armies and arms of the present day. The\r\nadoption of the system of universal military service has increased\r\nthe size of the standing armies of the nations of Europe far beyond\r\nthe proportionate increase of their respective populations. In round\r\nnumbers, the strength of the armies of the great powers is as follows:\r\nRussia, 869,000; Germany, 585,000; France, 618,000; Austria, 306,000;\r\nItaly, 231,000; Great Britain, 222,000.[3] Not only are the standing\r\narmies greater than in the early days of the century, but, owing to\r\nthe improved methods of transportation and supply, the forces now\r\nbrought upon the field of battle are vastly larger than in the days of\r\nNapoleon. The French army at Marengo was less than 30,000 strong. At\r\nAusterlitz it was only 70,000, which was its strength also at Waterloo.\r\nIn only two battles, Wagram and Leipsic, was Napoleon able to place\r\n150,000 men on the field; and in the latter battle the armies of all\r\nEurope opposed to him numbered only 280,000. In more recent times\r\nPrussia alone placed upon the field of Königgrätz 223,000 men with\r\nwhich to oppose the Austrian army of 206,000; and at Gravelotte the\r\ngreat French army of 180,000 men was outnumbered by the German host\r\nof 270,000. It is probable that in the next great European war more\r\nthan a million men will be found contending on a single battlefield.\r\nA detailed description of the armies of all the great powers would\r\nprove wearisome to the reader, for their points of resemblance are many\r\nand their general characteristics are the same. The German army may\r\nbe taken as the most perfect specimen of a highly organized military\r\nforce, and a description of its organization would answer with slight\r\nmodification for the other armies of Continental Europe.\r\n\r\n    [3] These numbers give the _peace_ strength of the armies. In\r\n        time of war they can easily be quadrupled.\r\n\r\nThe infantry of the German army is organized in companies of 250 men\r\neach. Four companies constitute a battalion, and three battalions\r\ncompose a regiment. The brigade consists of two regiments, and the\r\ndivision is composed of two brigades of infantry, four batteries of\r\nartillery, and a regiment of cavalry. The army corps consists of two\r\ndivisions, a body of corps artillery composed of twelve batteries,\r\na battalion of engineers, and a supply train. In round numbers, the\r\nfighting strength of the army corps consists of 30,000 men and 120\r\nguns. The cavalry is organized in squadrons of 150 sabres each, five\r\nsquadrons forming a regiment, only four of which are employed in\r\nthe field, the fifth remaining at the regimental depot. The cavalry\r\nbrigade consists of three regiments; and the cavalry division, which is\r\ncomposed of two brigades, aggregates 3600 sabres. Thus a small part of\r\nthe cavalry force is attached to the infantry divisions, while the bulk\r\nof it is organized into divisions composed of mounted troops alone, two\r\nbatteries of horse artillery being attached to each cavalry division.\r\nThe entire military force is divided into “armies,” each consisting of\r\nfrom three to six army corps and two or more cavalry divisions. The\r\ncavalry has about one sixth and the artillery about one seventh of the\r\nnumerical strength of the infantry. The German cavalry is armed with\r\nsabre, carbine, and lance. The officers carry the sabre and revolver.\r\n\r\nIn the army of the United States the organization differs in many\r\nrespects from that of the German army. The infantry companies each\r\nconsist of 106 men, including officers. Twelve companies form a\r\nregiment, and three regiments constitute a brigade. A division is\r\ncomposed of three brigades, and the army corps is made up of three\r\ndivisions. The number of batteries assigned to the divisions varies,\r\nas also the amount of corps artillery. In the army operating in Cuba,\r\nthe artillery was all in a separate organization, and was distributed\r\nto the divisions only on the eve of battle. Experience and theory\r\nalike suggest four batteries for each division and eight batteries for\r\nthe corps artillery. No cavalry is assigned to the divisions, but a\r\nregiment is supposed to be assigned to each army corps. The main force\r\nof the cavalry is grouped together into cavalry divisions. The cavalry\r\nis organized into troops of 100 sabres, four troops forming a squadron,\r\nand three squadrons constituting a regiment. Three regiments form a\r\nbrigade, and three brigades a division. The American cavalry brigade is\r\nthus of the same size as a Prussian cavalry division. The cavalry is\r\narmed with the sabre, carbine, and revolver. The lance is unknown in\r\nthe American army.\r\n\r\nHaving viewed the composition of modern armies, let us now see how they\r\nare armed. A consideration of the powder now in use is a necessary\r\npreface to a description of the weapons employed in the warfare of the\r\npresent day. The old fine-grained black powder familiar to every boy\r\nwho has ever handled a shotgun has passed completely out of military\r\nuse. The powders now employed usually have guncotton or nitroglycerine\r\nand guncotton for a base. They are practically smokeless, the product\r\nof their combustion is almost entirely gaseous, they leave no solid\r\nresiduum, and are of the quality known as “slow-burning,” giving a\r\nconstantly increasing pressure on the projectile from the moment of\r\nignition to the time when it leaves the muzzle of the piece. These\r\npowders are manufactured in thin sheets or small tubes or cords, which,\r\nfor small arms, are broken up into grains. They vary in color from\r\nlight yellow to black.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRISMATIC POWDER.]\r\n\r\nBefore the adoption of smokeless powder, the cake powder invented by\r\nGeneral Rodman had been highly developed and improved in the form of\r\n“cocoa powder.” This was made in hexagonal prisms, each perforated\r\nlongitudinally, so as to have a hollow core. These grains were\r\ncarefully arranged in the cartridges so as to have this core continuous\r\nfrom one grain to another, in order that upon ignition the combustion\r\nwould begin in the interior and produce a constantly increasing volume\r\nof gas as the exterior surface of the grain was reached. Though the\r\ntime of combustion was too rapid to be appreciated by the ordinary\r\nsenses, it was, nevertheless, quite different from the practically\r\ninstantaneous combustion of the old small-grain powder, and was\r\nsusceptible of accurate measurement. Much difficulty was experienced in\r\novercoming the detonating tendencies of the smokeless powders, but at\r\nlast the requisite slow-burning properties were obtained. The smokeless\r\npowder for large guns is made in cartridges composed of bundles of\r\nstrips or cords, or in the same prismatic form as the cocoa powder, and\r\nthe process of combustion is the same.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MORTAR ON REVOLVING HOIST.]\r\n\r\nThe form of the gun is dependent entirely upon the nature of the powder\r\nused. As the pressure of the gas constantly increases with the burning\r\nof the powder, the maximum force will be reached at the moment the\r\ncombustion is complete. The length of the bore should, therefore, be\r\njust sufficient to enable the powder to be entirely consumed at the\r\nexact instant the projectile leaves the muzzle of the piece. A shorter\r\nbore would cause much of the powder to be thrown out unconsumed, while\r\na much greater length would retard the projectile by subjecting it\r\nto the friction of the bore after the maximum force of the powder\r\nhad been reached. This accounts for the greatly increased length of\r\nthe modern cannon. A change in the method of gun construction has\r\naccordingly become necessary. Guns are no longer made of cast iron, but\r\nare “built up” of steel. The explosion of the powder is, of course,\r\nexerted in every direction, against the bore and sides of the piece as\r\nwell as against the base of the projectile. This produces two strains;\r\na longitudinal strain which is exerted in the direction of the axis\r\nof the piece, and a transverse strain which tends to burst the gun.\r\nIt is necessary, therefore, to have the piece so strong, especially\r\nat the points of first explosion, as to counteract these strains,\r\nand thus cause the entire force to be exerted upon the projectile in\r\nthe direction of the “least resistance.” This strength, or “initial\r\ntension,” is obtained by shrinking cylinders of steel over the\r\noriginal cylinder of the piece, each outer cylinder or jacket being a\r\nfew thousandths of an inch smaller in its interior diameter than the\r\nouter diameter of the cylinder which it incloses, and being expanded\r\nby heating to a sufficient degree to enable it to be slipped over the\r\nlatter. Upon cooling, the jacket exerts a constant and powerful force\r\nof compression, which counteracts the outward pressure of the force of\r\nexplosion. The longitudinal strain is less dangerous than the other,\r\nand is usually counteracted by an interlocking of some of the cylinders\r\nor hoops, to which the strain is transmitted from the breech-plug. The\r\nart of building up guns has been of slow growth, the first efforts in\r\nthis direction having been made by Sir W. G. Armstrong nearly half a\r\ncentury ago. The weight of the projectile of the present 16-inch gun in\r\nthe United States service is 2370 pounds; the charge of powder weighs\r\n1060 pounds, and the extreme range is more than 14 miles. The cost of\r\neach shot is $450, and when we consider that this does not include the\r\nwear and tear of the gun, it is evident that money has become more than\r\never before “the sinews of war.”\r\n\r\nNot less remarkable than the improvement in cannon is the improvement\r\nin mortars. These mortars are very unlike the clumsy weapons of that\r\nname manipulated by hand-spikes, which were known in our great war.\r\nThey are now mounted on a platform which turns on rollers. They are\r\nelevated or depressed by a mechanical appliance, are loaded at the\r\nbreech, are accurately rifled, and can drop their projectiles on the\r\ndecks of hostile vessels at a range of six miles. They are placed in\r\ngroups of four, each in a separate pit, some batteries containing as\r\nmany as four groups, or sixteen mortars. In all important sea-coast\r\nbatteries both guns and mortars are so arranged as to be fired by\r\nelectricity, either singly or in volleys.\r\n\r\nA dynamite gun has been devised by Captain Zalinsky for the purpose,\r\nas the name implies, of throwing a projectile containing dynamite.\r\nAttempts to fire dynamite projectiles by means of powder have thus far\r\nfailed. In the Zalinsky gun the propelling power is compressed air. The\r\nprojectile contains from fifty to sixty pounds of gelatine dynamite,\r\nthe explosion of which is terrific. Excellent results have been\r\nobtained with Zalinsky’s gun up to a range of 2000 yards, but as this\r\nis insignificant in comparison with the enormous range of high-power\r\ncannon using powder as a charge, the dynamite gun is still a weapon of\r\nlimited usefulness. Although the dynamite gun has not as yet fulfilled\r\nthe desired requirements as to range, promising experiments have been\r\nmade in firing shells charged with high explosives from mortars using\r\ncharges of powder, and it is probably a question of only a short time\r\nbefore means will be found for successfully firing dynamite in a\r\nsimilar manner.\r\n\r\nThe great improvements in field artillery make the cannon of the early\r\nbattlefields of the century seem, in comparison, almost like harmless\r\ntoys. The modern field gun is made of steel, is rifled, loads at the\r\nbreech, and has great rapidity and accuracy of fire. The extreme range\r\nof the 3.2-inch field gun in the United States service is about four\r\nmiles. This, in fact, is beyond the ordinary range of human vision,\r\nand it is but rarely that the ground for so great a distance is free\r\nfrom features that obstruct the view. For these reasons the fire\r\nof field guns can seldom be utilized beyond a range of two miles.\r\nThe projectile of the 3.2-inch field gun weighs 13½ pounds, and the\r\ncharge of powder 3½ pounds. The 3.6-inch gun is a still more powerful\r\nweapon, the weight of the projectile and charge being 20 and 4½\r\npounds respectively. Shells are used against inanimate objects, such\r\nas earthworks or buildings; but the great artillery projectile for\r\nthe battlefield is shrapnel. It is now very different from the crude\r\nprojectile known by the same name in the early years of the century.\r\nThe bullets are assembled in circular layers and held in position by\r\n“separators,” which are short cast-iron cylinders with hemispherical\r\ncavities into which the bullets fit. The bottom separator fits by\r\nmeans of lugs into recesses at the base of the shrapnel, and prevents\r\nindependent rotation of the charge of bullets. The top separator is\r\nsmooth on its upper side, and is kept firmly in place by the head\r\nof the projectile, which screws against it. The separators prevent\r\nmovement or deformation of the bullets under shock of discharge, and\r\nbeing weakened by radial cuts, increase the effect by furnishing\r\nadditional fragments of effective weight. The shrapnel for the 3.2-inch\r\ngun contains 162 bullets one half inch in diameter and weighing 41 to\r\nthe pound. The total number of bullets and individual pieces in the\r\nshrapnel is 201.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MODERN SHRAPNEL.]\r\n\r\nThe heavy sea-coast guns are now mounted either in armored turrets,\r\n_en barbette_, or on disappearing gun-carriages. The first system is\r\nvery costly and is not generally used in the United States. The second\r\nsystem, in which the guns are fired over a parapet and are constantly\r\nexposed, is used only in rare cases. The third has been perfected in\r\nthe United States in the Buffington-Crozier and the Gordon disappearing\r\ngun-carriages. These carriages enable the gun to be loaded in safety\r\nunder cover of the carriage pit, and then to be raised by means of\r\ncounterweights or compressed air to a position from which it can fire\r\nover the parapet. With trained cannoneers, the gun can be raised and\r\nfired in twenty seconds, and this brief period of exposure, especially\r\nwhen smokeless powder is used, renders it almost impossible for the\r\nenemy to locate the gun with any degree of accuracy. The shock of the\r\nrecoil, taken up by pneumatic or hydraulic cylinders, brings the piece\r\nback, quickly but gently, to the loading position, whence it is again\r\nraised for firing.\r\n\r\nThe siege artillery of the United States army consists of the 5-inch\r\ngun, the 7-inch howitzer, and the 7-inch mortar. They all use shell,\r\nand their effective range is from three to four miles.\r\n\r\nWhen the enemy is sheltered behind entrenchments it is difficult to\r\nreach him with shrapnel fired from field guns. Field mortars have\r\naccordingly been devised for this purpose and have given excellent\r\nresults. The United States 3.6-inch field mortar is rifled, and carries\r\na shrapnel weighing twenty pounds. The weight of the field mortar is\r\nonly 500 pounds, and it can be easily carried in a cart drawn by a\r\nsingle mule.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KRAG-JORGENSEN RIFLE.]\r\n\r\nBut great as the improvements have been in artillery, they are less\r\nimportant than the changes effected in the infantry rifle; for upon\r\nthe quality of the infantry depends, more than upon anything else, the\r\nefficiency of an army. There are many kinds of rifles now in use in the\r\ndifferent armies of the world, but in their essential principles they\r\nare very similar. All use smokeless powder, and all are provided with\r\na magazine which admits of firing a number of shots without reloading.\r\nThe Springfield rifle formerly in use in the United States army has\r\nbeen replaced by the Krag-Jorgensen, which has a magazine holding live\r\ncartridges, and is provided with a cut-off which enables the piece to\r\nbe used as a single-shooter. When an emergency demands rapid fire,\r\nthe opening of the cut-off enables the cartridges in the magazine to\r\nbe fired in rapid succession. The range of the Krag-Jorgensen is 4066\r\nyards, being practically equal to that of the Mauser, which, in the\r\nhands of the Spaniards, inflicted casualties upon our men when they\r\nwere more than two miles from the hostile position. The difference in\r\nthe penetrating power of the Krag-Jorgensen and the Springfield is\r\nshown in the accompanying illustration, taken from the report of the\r\nchief of ordnance for 1893. The Springfield lead bullet was fired with\r\n69 grains of black powder, and penetrated 3.3 inches of poorly seasoned\r\noak, the bullet being badly deformed. With a bullet covered with a\r\nGerman silver jacket the penetration was 5.3 inches, the bullet being\r\nagain deformed. The Krag-Jorgensen used a bullet consisting of a lead\r\ncore and a cupronickeled jacket, which was fired with 37 grains of\r\nsmokeless powder. The bullet penetrated well-seasoned oak to a distance\r\nof 24.2 inches and was taken out in perfect condition. The new rifle,\r\nat short ranges, has an almost explosive effect and produces a shocking\r\nwound; but at ordinary ranges the wounds inflicted by it may be almost\r\ncharacterized as merciful, for the bullet makes a clean puncture, and\r\nunless a vital organ is struck the wound heals easily and quickly. The\r\nold expression of “forty rounds,” so familiar to veterans of the Civil\r\nWar, is now obsolete; for no soldier now thinks of going into action\r\nwith less than 150 cartridges on his person. Not only is the firing\r\nmore rapid than was formerly the case, but the lighter weight of the\r\ncartridge enables a greater number to be carried.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPRINGFIELD, CAL. 45 (LEAD BULLET).\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, CAL. 45 (GERMAN SILVER JACKET).\r\n\r\nKRAG-JORGENSEN, CAL. 30 (NICKEL STEEL BULLET).]\r\n\r\nFrom the rifle to the Gatling gun is only a step, for the latter is\r\nessentially a collection of rifle barrels fired by machinery. It\r\nconsists of a number—generally ten—of rifle barrels grouped around,\r\nand parallel to, a central shaft, each barrel being provided with a\r\nlock. By turning a crank at the breech, the barrels and locks are made\r\nto revolve together around the shaft, the locks having also a forward\r\nand backward motion, the first of which inserts the cartridge into\r\nthe barrel and closes the breech at the time of the discharge, while\r\nthe latter extracts the cartridge after firing. Upon the gun, near\r\nthe breech, is a hopper which receives the cartridges from the feed\r\ncase. The cartridge falls from the hopper into the breech-block of\r\nthe uppermost barrel, and in the course of the first half-revolution\r\nof the barrel it is inserted, the hammer is drawn back, and at the\r\nlowest point of the revolution the breech is closed and the cartridge\r\nis fired. As the barrel comes up in the second half-revolution the\r\ncartridge shell is extracted, and when the barrel reaches the top it\r\nreceives another cartridge. The Gatling gun can be fired at the rate of\r\n1000 to 1500 shots a minute. It generally uses the same cartridge as\r\nthe infantry rifle; but some patterns of the gun fire a projectile an\r\ninch in diameter, and approximate closely in their effect to a field\r\ngun. The gun is mounted either on a carriage similar to that of a\r\nfield-piece or on a tripod. Gatling guns were very successfully used by\r\nthe British in the Zulu War and in the Soudan, and by our own troops in\r\nthe battles around Santiago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GATLING GUN.]\r\n\r\nThe Gardner is a lighter machine gun than the Gatling. It consists of\r\ntwo parallel rifle barrels, and is operated by means of mechanism at\r\nthe breech, which, as in the case of the Gatling, is worked with a\r\ncrank. It can fire 500 shots a minute without danger of overheating,\r\nas the breeches are enclosed in a metallic water-jacket. Its extreme\r\nportability makes it a most valuable weapon, though its firing capacity\r\nis not equal to that of the Gatling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NORDENFELT RAPID FIRE GUN.]\r\n\r\nThere are several other types of machine guns, but the most ingenious,\r\nand perhaps the most effective, is the Maxim automatic gun. This has\r\na single barrel, about two thirds of which, from the muzzle towards\r\nthe breech, is surrounded by a water-jacket into which water is\r\nautomatically injected at each discharge, thus rendering overheating\r\nimpossible. The mechanism for operating the gun is at the breech,\r\ncovering the remaining third of the barrel. All that is necessary is to\r\ndraw back the trigger to fire the first shot; the recoil of the piece\r\nagain cocks it, and the gun is then automatically fired, the process\r\nbeing kept up until the cartridges in the feed-belt are all expended.\r\nThe cartridges are fed to the piece by means of belts holding 333\r\nrounds, two or more of the belts being joined together if desired. The\r\nMaxim gun can easily fire ten shots a second, and if every man at the\r\npiece were killed the moment the first shot was fired the gun would\r\nkeep on until it fired at least 332 more shots.\r\n\r\nThe Gatling, Gardner, Maxim, and similar guns are known as machine\r\nguns. Of the same general family, so to speak, are rapid-fire guns,\r\nwhich are, however, distinguished from machine guns by having a larger\r\ncalibre, loading by hand, having only one barrel, and being provided\r\nwith artificial means of checking recoil and returning the piece to\r\nthe firing position. They use metallic ammunition, and have a breech\r\nmechanism which cocks the firing pin and extracts the empty case by the\r\nsame motion which opens the breech for reloading.\r\n\r\nRapid-firing guns were first designed as a means of naval defense\r\nagainst torpedo boats. They deliver a rapid and easily aimed fire,\r\nand use projectiles of sufficient power to penetrate the plates of\r\nthe boats. In the naval service the gun is mounted on a spring return\r\ncarriage fixed to the vessel, so that the piece, when discharged, is\r\nbrought back to the firing position without any derangement of aim. On\r\nland a rigid carriage is used. This carriage has a spade at the end\r\nof the trail, which is forced into the ground by the recoil and holds\r\nthe gun and carriage in place. The principal rapid-fire guns are the\r\nHotchkiss, Driggs-Schroeder, Nordenfelt, Krupp, Canet, and Armstrong,\r\nwhich fire from five to ten shots a minute, and use either shell or\r\nshrapnel. Experiments are now being made in different armies with a\r\nview to adopting rapid-fire guns for field artillery.\r\n\r\nThe principle of rapid fire, or “quick fire,” has been successfully\r\napplied to guns having a caliber as great as six inches. The metallic\r\ncartridge used in rapid-fire guns is, in appearance, simply a “big\r\nbrother” of the cartridge used in the infantry rifle.\r\n\r\nClosely allied with guns, both in coast defense and in naval warfare,\r\nare torpedoes. The crude weapons of this type, used in the War of\r\nSecession, have been developed into formidable engines of war, before\r\nwhose destructive power the strongest vessels are helpless. For their\r\nclassification and description _see_ “The Century’s Naval Progress,”\r\npages 84, 85.\r\n\r\nThe destructive power of torpedoes is so well known as to give them\r\na great moral weight as a means of defense. The fact that the German\r\nharbors on the Baltic were known to be protected by torpedoes saved\r\nthem from an attack by the French navy in 1870–71, and Cervera’s fleet\r\nin the harbor of Santiago, in 1898, was safe from our squadron so long\r\nas the mouth of the channel was closed with Spanish torpedoes.\r\n\r\nThough necessarily brief, the foregoing sketch will show that in the\r\ncourse of the nineteenth century armies have increased enormously in\r\nsize, and in the power of rapid movement and certainty of supply.\r\nInfantry has increased in relative numbers and in importance. Extended\r\norder fighting, in which the individuality of the soldier comes into\r\nplay, has taken the place of the old rigid shoulder-to-shoulder line\r\nof battle. The private soldier’s vocation has risen, in many branches\r\nof the military service, from a trade to a profession, and now, more\r\nthan ever before, is extensive training and a high order of intellect\r\nnecessary for the command of armies. Wars have become shorter, sharper,\r\nmore decisive and more terrible; and increased emphasis has been placed\r\nupon the warning, “In time of peace prepare for war.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CENTURY’S PROGRESS IN AGRICULTURE\r\n\r\nBY WALDO F. BROWN,\r\n\r\n_Agricultural Editor “Cincinnati Gazette.”_\r\n\r\n\r\nI. VICISSITUDES OF EARLY FARMING.\r\n\r\nIf the thought enters the mind of the reader that a youth (?) of\r\nsixty-seven is not competent to write upon agricultural improvement for\r\nthe entire century, the answer is that such improvement can scarcely be\r\nsaid to have begun until near the middle of the century; that the early\r\nforties saw the writer at work on a farm; that he has ever since lived\r\non a farm; and that he, therefore, writes from personal experience of\r\nthe improvements which have transformed agriculture from a simple art\r\nto a profound science.\r\n\r\nTo realize the progress agriculture has made, we must understand its\r\ncondition in the first half of the century, and the causes which\r\nprevented improvement at that time. The soil was rich with the\r\naccumulations of centuries, and the farmer was at no expense to either\r\nmaintain or restore fertility, for with but indifferent cultivation\r\nlarge crops could be raised. When a field became impoverished, with axe\r\nand torch a new field was soon cleared from the forest. The implements\r\nin use were of the crudest and mostly manufactured by the nearest\r\nblacksmith, and it cost but a few dollars to equip a farm; still they\r\nwere sufficient for the wants of the farmer of that date. So it will be\r\nseen that the difficulty was not in the farm nor with the farmer; for\r\nhe could grow not only all that was necessary for family use, but more\r\nthan enough to supply the demand for such market as he had. Perhaps\r\nthe greatest difficulty in the way of agricultural progress was the\r\nwant of transportation facilities; for a market was of little use to\r\na farmer if he was separated from it by a hundred miles or more of\r\nroads which, through almost the entire winter, were so deep with mud\r\nthat modern farmers would think them utterly impassable, with streams\r\nunbridged and hills ungraded. The first step toward relieving the\r\nfarmer of this trouble was John Quincy Adams’ message to Congress in\r\n1827, when he recommended the construction of the National Road, the\r\neastern terminus of which was to be in Maryland and the western at St.\r\nLouis, Mo. This road was constructed within a few years. It was the\r\nfirst outlet for the crops of the great West, and over it, across the\r\nAlleghany Mountains, a procession of covered wagons passed during the\r\nentire year, carrying the products of the farms to the Eastern markets\r\nand bringing back manufactured goods. One other avenue was opened for\r\nthe interchange of products between these two sections, the Erie Canal\r\nbeing completed in 1825, and enlarged and improved many years later.\r\n\r\nDuring the thirties, just preceding the era of railroads, there was\r\nalmost a craze on the subject of canal building, and scores of miles\r\nof canals were begun which were never completed, as with the beginning\r\nof the fourth decade of the century the railroad idea had taken\r\npossession of the minds of the people. In some cases the tow-path of\r\nthe canal formed the roadbed for the railroad which superseded it, and\r\nprobably more lines of canal were abandoned than were completed. The\r\nera of railroads—that wonderful factor which was to revolutionize\r\nfarming—dates from about 1830. The first locomotive in the United\r\nStates was imported from England and placed upon the rails in 1829, and\r\nin 1830 the first American locomotive was built. It was, however, very\r\nnear the middle of the century before the system of railroads had been\r\ncompleted so as to materially improve the condition of agriculture; and\r\nalthough the fact may sound strange to some, the first railroad train\r\nran into Chicago in 1852. During these years of depressed agriculture,\r\nhowever, the population of the country was rapidly increasing.\r\n\r\nWhile the railroad system of the country was developing, turnpikes were\r\nbeing built radiating from the principal markets and railroad stations.\r\nWith the beginning of the second half of the century the farmers\r\nawoke to the fact that the United States was a large and populous\r\nnation, requiring an immense amount of supplies, and that improvements\r\nfor transportation had been furnished so that the markets were\r\neasily accessible. Before passing, however, from the discouragements\r\nand difficulties of agriculture in the early days, some practical\r\nillustrations of the difficulties met with seem necessary to give a\r\nclear understanding of the condition. What would the farmer of to-day\r\nthink were he obliged to start with a load of wheat in midwinter over\r\nroads which crossed unbridged streams and wound over clay hills, not\r\na rod of which was macadamized and all of which were poorly graded,\r\nspending ten days with a four-horse team to make a round trip of one\r\nhundred miles with thirty-five bushels of wheat, and sell it in the\r\nmarket for 35 cents a bushel? Yet such was the fact which the writer\r\nhad from the lips of a farmer who had been through this experience. Two\r\nthoughts may occur to the reader—first, that thirty-five bushels was a\r\nlight load for a four-horse team, and, second, that hotel bills would\r\nmore than absorb the money received from such a load of wheat. But both\r\nof these are explained by saying that one cause of the lightness of the\r\nload was that the farmer must carry feed for his team for the entire\r\ntrip, and another, the uncertainty of the condition of the roads; for\r\nthough he might start with the roads frozen solid and possibly worn\r\nsmooth by the teams which had preceded him, he was liable on the trip\r\nto meet with a sudden thaw which reduced the roadbed to mortar, so that\r\nthe wheels would sink almost to the axle, and in many cases the load\r\nwould be found too heavy for his team. It was no uncommon sight to see\r\na score of places to the mile where the fences had been torn down and\r\nrails carried into the middle of the road to be used in prying the\r\nwagons out of the mud when hopelessly mired. The reason the hotel bills\r\ndid not consume the proceeds of the load was that there were none; for\r\nthe farmer carried his camp kettle, bedding, and provisions with him,\r\nand slept in the wagon during his entire trip. The same farmer referred\r\nto, in telling his story, said that all the money spent on the ten\r\ndays’ trip was three “fips” (18¾ cents), and that, presumably, was for\r\nthree “nips” of whiskey.\r\n\r\nAn interesting personal experience in the winter of 1846–47 was in\r\ndriving hogs from Anderson, Ind., to Cincinnati, Ohio, a distance of\r\nabout 150 miles. The drove was started with the mercury at zero, and\r\nthe first difficulty met was in getting them across White River, as\r\nthere was no bridge and the stream must be forded. The hogs absolutely\r\nrefused to enter the icy water, but the pioneer of that day was equal\r\nto any emergency. The drove was soon huddled on the bank, rails were\r\ncarried from an adjoining field, and a close pen was built around them;\r\nthen two plucky frontiersmen, with thick leggings reaching from ankle\r\nto hips, towed them by the ears to frozen shoal water in the centre of\r\nthe river, and pushed them across the ice, when they were obliged to go\r\nashore on the other side. Two days later a sudden and unexpected thaw\r\nset in, when for one hundred weary miles the drivers urged the hogs\r\nthrough mud which reached from fence to fence, and which was so fluid\r\nthat not a trace was left behind, as it flowed in to fill not only the\r\ntrack of the hogs but the footsteps of the drivers. When after days\r\nof urging the hogs began to lose strength and fall by the way, they\r\nsettled down into the ooze, from which the men must lift them into\r\nwagons which accompanied the drove or were hired from farmers along\r\nthe road. When Cincinnati was reached it seemed that the worst trouble\r\nof the journey was over; but not so, for the climax of disaster with\r\nthis drove was reached at the slaughter-house, when for two weeks the\r\nweather was so warm that no slaughtering could be done, and the price\r\nof pork declined day by day, until the entire drove was finally sold\r\nat one and three quarters cents per pound dressed weight—and during\r\nthe entire time, both on the road and in the pens, the hogs had been\r\nlosing rapidly in weight every day. This was the lowest price recalled\r\nfor hogs; but it was very common to have a glut in the market of\r\nsome staple which reduced the price so low that it scarcely paid for\r\ntransportation, and in some cases made it actually unsalable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOIL PULVERIZER.]\r\n\r\nA neighbor relates that when he was a boy, needing some money, his\r\nfather made him the offer that he might have all the corn that he would\r\nshell, take to mill, and market the meal in Cincinnati, forty miles\r\ndistant. He went to work with a will, prepared a two-horse load, and\r\nreached Cincinnati with it safely, only to find the market glutted so\r\nthat he could not get an offer on it. A part of it was finally sold at\r\n10 cents per bushel, and the remainder was taken home.\r\n\r\nDuring the closing years of the fifth decade the prices of stock\r\nwere at the lowest, good dairy cows bringing from $7 to $9 per\r\nhead; yearling calves from $1 to $2; the very best horses, $40, and\r\nstock hogs selling for $1 or $2 each. At the same time many of the\r\nnecessities of life were sold at exorbitant prices, and an examination\r\nof an old account book shows the following figures: Salt, $4 per\r\nbarrel; nails, 6 to 8 cents per pound; calico, 12½ cents per yard;\r\ndrilling, 25 cents per yard; clocks, $40 each (the value of the best\r\nhorses!).\r\n\r\nSome other facts must be taken into consideration to understand why\r\nthe farmers did not attempt improved methods. One was the condition\r\nof the currency. The United States Bank, which it would seem should\r\nhave afforded security and stability to the currency, had been wrecked\r\nby the action of Andrew Jackson in vetoing its rechartering and\r\nwithdrawing the United States funds (at that date about $43,000,000)\r\nfrom it; and private banks had been established over the entire\r\nwest and south, a system of what was then known as “wild cat” banks\r\nsupplying the people with currency. The man who was trading needed to\r\ncarry in his pocket at all times a “bank detector,” to which he might\r\nrefer to ascertain how many cents on the dollar the issue of each bank\r\nwas worth.\r\n\r\nLooking back at the condition of affairs as described, remembering how\r\nfew the markets, how easily glutted, how unstable the currency, and all\r\nthe uncertainties connected with the disposal of the farmer’s products,\r\nwhat was there to stimulate him to improve his methods or increase his\r\nproducts? If, as was occasionally the case, the farmer determined to\r\nimprove his stock, he must import from England or buy at high prices\r\nfrom an importer, and there being no express companies to deliver his\r\nstock, he must either go in person or trust to private individuals to\r\ndrive them over the mountains or, if small stock, to bring them in\r\nwagons the entire distance.\r\n\r\nHe could not afford to carry on a wide correspondence, for each\r\nindividual letter cost twenty-five cents postage, if the distance\r\nwas over three hundred miles. It was not until 1845 that postage was\r\nreduced to ten cents, and ten years later it was reduced to three cents\r\nfor letters of half an ounce.\r\n\r\nIf any one is inclined to throw the blame upon the farmers for not\r\nhaving done their part to improve agriculture and bring prosperity,\r\nhe should consider the conditions under which they had lived for a\r\ngeneration; the uncertain markets; the low prices of products; that\r\nthey must construct roads and bridges, build schoolhouses and churches,\r\nclear the farms, nearly all of which were covered with heavy timber;\r\nand the fact that all this work was done with the crudest implements.\r\nIt will be seen that the farmers had been accomplishing wonders and\r\nwere worthy of the highest praise rather than blame.\r\n\r\nWith the beginning of the last half of the century, the farmers\r\nsuddenly awoke to the fact that the conditions had become wonderfully\r\nfavorable. Towns and cities were growing up on every hand, offering\r\nnew markets. Railroads and other means of transportation were opening\r\nto them. Inventive genius had taken up the improvement of implements\r\nof agriculture, and, best of all, prices had advanced greatly for all\r\nthe leading products. The improvements of methods in farming, which\r\nhave not been less than those in manufacturing and other callings,\r\ndate from this time, and will be described under the following heads:\r\nImprovements in implements; in stock; in drainage and tillage; in\r\nthe maintaining and increasing of fertility; in care and feeding of\r\nstock; in and around the farmer’s home; and education, which includes\r\nagricultural literature, farmer’s organizations, and schools.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. IMPROVEMENTS IN FARM IMPLEMENTS AND MACHINERY.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE COLUMBIA HARVESTER AND BINDER.]\r\n\r\nIn writing on the improvements in agriculture one can scarcely fail\r\nto be impressed with the fact that whenever the human race comes to\r\nthe point that it must have help and make a demand upon nature, she\r\nalways honors the draft; and as the steps are portrayed by which\r\nthe agricultural products of this continent have been increased a\r\nhundred fold, while the power of the individual worker has increased\r\nwonderfully, and the labor has been lightened by machinery, we can see\r\nthat these inventions and improvements came just as fast as they were\r\nneeded, and no faster. God has given to the human mind such power, and\r\nto the hands such skill, that whatever is necessary is soon provided\r\nwhen the want is made known. Perhaps there is no better way in which\r\nthis can be traced than in the appliances by which the farmer feeds the\r\nworld. It is an interesting study to note the successive steps in the\r\nimprovement of implements for the work of the farm. In the beginning\r\nof the century the sickle and flail were all that were needed to cut\r\nand thresh the grain; and it was by a series of steps that the steam\r\nthresher and the combined mower and binder were evolved. The sickle was\r\nall that was needed until population increased and markets were made\r\naccessible; then the cradle was invented. With the former, an expert\r\ncould cut an acre a day, and with the latter four or more acres; but\r\nall the work was done by human muscle. The man using a sickle must\r\nwork with bended back all day. The cradle enabled him to work erect,\r\nand lightened the labor; but when the “Reaper sickle” was invented\r\nthe labor was transferred to brute muscle. The first machines were\r\nclumsy and heavy to draw, requiring as much, or more, power to cut the\r\ngrain as to cut and bind it with the light running modern binder. Now,\r\nthe man who sweltered with bended back ten or twelve hours to cut an\r\nacre of grain with the sickle “drives his team afield,” and by simply\r\nguiding it cuts and binds ten or fifteen acres a day, and carries the\r\nbundles to the shock row.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMPROVED THRESHER WITH BLOWER AND SELF-FEEDER.]\r\n\r\nThe improvement in threshing machinery has been as marked as in that\r\nfor harvesting the grain. In the first part of the century all the\r\nwork was done with the flail, and on farms where a large amount of\r\ngrain was grown it kept a man busy a good part of the winter to thresh\r\nit. The first improvement was in threshing the grain by tramping it\r\nout with horses, and with two men and four horses, under the most\r\nfavorable conditions, from fifty to one hundred bushels could be\r\nthreshed in a day. But by both these methods there was the disadvantage\r\nthat in all damp weather the work must be stopped, as the grain would\r\nbecome so tough that it could not be threshed. Another disadvantage\r\nof these methods was that it took a long time to prepare the crop for\r\nmarket, and in case of a sudden rise in price the farmer could not\r\ntake advantage of it as he now can when his grain is all threshed in a\r\nsingle day and held in the granary for sale. In the thirties, the first\r\nthreshing machines were put in use, and were but little improvement\r\nover the method of tramping with horses. The machines were of small\r\ncapacity, and simply threshed the grain, but did not separate it from\r\nthe straw and chaff, both of which operations had to be done by hand;\r\nand if the straw was to be saved, either in the barn or in a stack, it\r\nhad to be all handled with rakes and forks. The first threshing machine\r\nthat the writer ever saw was one that was called “The Traveller.” This\r\nwas followed by machines run by stationary horse-power. These were\r\ncalled “chaff pilers,” from the fact that they threshed the wheat but\r\ndid not separate it from the straw or chaff. The first horse-powers\r\nwere inclined planes, or endless chain powers, as they were called,\r\nand were run by the weight of the horses, the floor revolving under\r\ntheir weight as they attempted to go up the grade. These were soon\r\nsuperseded by lever powers, made at first for two or four horses, but\r\nafterward increased in size and power until ten or twelve horses were\r\nused; and about this time the machinery for separating the grain and\r\nchaff was added to the machine. It almost seemed to the farmers at this\r\ntime that perfection had been reached when two or three hundred bushels\r\ncould be threshed in a day and also cleaned; but the feeding of this\r\nlarge number of horses was a heavy tax upon the farmers, particularly\r\nwhen a rainy day would intervene before the job was finished, and they\r\nwere obliged to keep the horses two or three days. The invention and\r\nintroduction of the mounted steam-engine not only saved the farmer\r\nfrom this expense, but also increased the power and doubled the daily\r\ncapacity of the machine. For a short time the farmers were satisfied\r\nwith this; but the engine was heavy, and often the farmers’ teams\r\nwere light, and as it was the rule that each man must draw the engine\r\nfrom his farm to where the next job was to be done, and often the\r\ndistance was great and the roads bad, it was not long until he tired\r\nof this. Then came the traction engine, which not only transported\r\nitself but also drew the thresher and separator. About this time\r\nanother difficulty arose; for now that the machine had been improved\r\nand the power increased so that under favorable conditions a thousand\r\nbushels could be threshed in a day, the handling of the straw became a\r\nserious problem, for it was impossible to build it in a stack suitable\r\nfor keeping as fast as the machine would deliver it. The first step\r\nto lighten and expedite this labor was in adding a straw carrier, a\r\nkind of revolving platform, which was attached to the separator and\r\nwould lift the straw some twelve or fifteen feet. For a year or two\r\nthe farmers were satisfied with this help, but soon found that it was\r\ninadequate for the work. Then the stacker was invented, a separate\r\nmachine which was backed under the straw carrier to receive the straw,\r\nand which had, mounted on wheels, an elevator which would carry the\r\nstraw to a height of twenty-five or thirty feet; and not only could it\r\ndo this, but it was the work of a moment, with a crank at its base,\r\nto raise it, and it could be run at any angle. When the machine first\r\nstarted, the straw carrier was placed horizontally, and as the stack\r\ngrew in height, it was raised until in the finishing out of the stack\r\nit stood at an angle of forty-five degrees or more. The straw carrier\r\ncould not only be raised, but by an ingenious arrangement of small\r\nwheels, it could be moved from side to side by a light pressure with\r\none hand, or by a man on the stack pushing it with his fork. With\r\nthis admirable machine for handling the straw, it seemed as though\r\nperfection had been reached, and that there was now practically nothing\r\nmore to be desired. But it was not long until the farmer found that\r\nwith the delivery of six tons of straw per hour it was heavy work for\r\nsix men to build the stack, and that it was the most disagreeable work\r\nabout the machine because of the dust. About 1890, some inventive\r\ngenius produced the “blower” to take the place of the stacker. This\r\nis a long jointed tube, some sixteen or eighteen inches in diameter,\r\nmounted at the rear of the cylinder through which the straw is forced\r\nby compressed air which is furnished by the machine. It can be raised\r\nor lowered, turned to the right or to the left, so as to deliver\r\nthe straw at any desired point on the stack. It is managed by a man\r\nstanding on top of the separator near the rear end, does away entirely\r\nwith any hands on the stack, and thus reduces the force about six\r\nmen. Some other improvements which have been added are the putting of\r\nknives in the cylinder to cut the bands, thus saving one or two hands,\r\nfor often it was necessary to have a man on each side for cutting the\r\nbands when the wheat was dry and the work was done with the greatest\r\nrapidity. Then a revolving platform, called a self-feeder, was added in\r\nfront of the cylinder, on which platform the bundles could be thrown\r\nfrom a wagon standing on each side, and be carried automatically and\r\ndumped into the cylinder, doing away with the man who formerly fed the\r\nbundles to the machine. To some machines an automatic weigher has been\r\nattached, which does away with a man for measuring and keeping tally\r\nof the wheat. Compare for a moment this modern machinery which, with\r\na force of twelve or fourteen men, will thresh and clean for market\r\nfrom 1200 to 1600 bushels of wheat per day, with the man with the flail\r\nlaboriously pounding out ten bushels, and you will get a vivid idea\r\nof the progress in agricultural machinery. One somewhat curious fact\r\nmust be taken into account in this, which is, that with some of these\r\nmost wonderful machines the cost of labor is about the same it formerly\r\nwas. But the advantage is that the work can be done in a few hours, and\r\nthe farmer’s crop be ready for market to take advantage of increased\r\nprices, while by the old plan the work would reach almost through the\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AUTOMATIC MOUNTED STACKER WITH FOLDING ATTACHMENT.]\r\n\r\nIn the cutting and handling of hay there has been as great improvement\r\nas in any portion of the farm. A first-class mowing machine, new from\r\nthe shop, can now be bought for $40 or less, and with it the farmer can\r\ndrive to the field after supper, in the cool of the day, and in an hour\r\ncut more grass, and do it better, than a man could with a scythe by\r\nworking hard all day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DISK HARROW.]\r\n\r\nInstead of shaking out the swaths slowly with a fork, with a single\r\nhorse hitched to a hay tedder about two acres an hour can be shaken up\r\nand left in such shape that both sun and wind have perfect access to it\r\nand cause it to cure rapidly.\r\n\r\nInstead of raking the hay laboriously by hand, a steel sulky rake does\r\nthe work easily and quickly, doing more in an hour than was possible in\r\na day with the hand rake. On farms where the acreage of hay is large, a\r\nself-loader attached to the rear of the wagon gathers the hay from the\r\nwindrow and delivers it on the wagon. At the barn, instead of the slow\r\nand wearisome hand pitching, the hay fork and hay carrier deliver it in\r\nthe top of the highest barns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ACME HARROW.]\r\n\r\nThe invention of the hay baler enables the farmer now to condense his\r\ncrop, so that one third of the room for storage formerly required for\r\nhay will answer; and it also enables him to ship it to market by rail,\r\nwhere formerly it was necessary that it should be taken in wagons.\r\n\r\nWhile the plough has not been improved to the extent that many of\r\nour farm implements have been, it is vastly superior to those used by\r\nthe pioneers, and modifies somewhat the adage of “Poor Richard,” who\r\nwrote:—\r\n\r\n   “He who by the plough would thrive,\r\n    Himself must either hold or drive;”\r\n\r\nfor the modern ploughman must not only hold and drive, but drive\r\nthree horses at that, and turn as many acres in a day. Another adage\r\nattributed to “Poor Richard” was—\r\n\r\n   “Plough deep while sluggards sleep,\r\n    And you shall have corn to sell and keep.”\r\n\r\nBut the modern farmer has learned that the depth to which he ploughs\r\nmust be governed by the nature of his soil, and that deep ploughing on\r\nheavy clay lands, or lands with a crude subsoil, is often the cause of\r\nshort crops and permanent injury to the soil.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful if in any line of farm implements there has been more\r\nimprovement than in that of harrows; and yet this improvement dates\r\nback but about a quarter of a century, as previous to that time the\r\nold “A” harrow or drag, which was hard on the team and did indifferent\r\nwork, was the only one found on most farms. More recently the cutting\r\nand slicing harrows have been largely introduced, and many other forms\r\nof improved harrows have been put on the market. For the preparation of\r\nhard land for a seed bed, especially for small grain, the disk harrow\r\ncannot be excelled.\r\n\r\nBut for garden use, or for pulverizing sod land which has not been too\r\nmuch compacted, the slicing Acme harrow is the most perfect implement\r\nin use, it being of light draft, easily transferred from field to\r\nfield, and capable of making the finest and best seed-bed.\r\n\r\nThe cultivators in use have been greatly improved. It is necessary to\r\ndescribe but two of them. The two-horse cultivator with fenders, which\r\nenables the farmer to cultivate both sides of the row at once, driving\r\ntwo horses in the field instead of one, as by the old method, has more\r\nthan doubled the capacity of the individual; as by its use he is able\r\nnot only to cultivate both sides of the row at once, but to dispense\r\nentirely with the man who, under the old rule, was obliged to follow\r\nthe cultivator and uncover the corn. This “fender” is exceedingly\r\nsimple, and the only wonder is that it took the farmer so long to\r\nfind out its value. Costing but a few cents, it has saved the farmers\r\nmillions of dollars, as previous to its adoption it was necessary to\r\nhave one man follow each one-horse plow to uncover the corn. There\r\nare two forms of this “fender,” the simplest being a light piece of\r\ngalvanized sheet iron attached to the cultivator or plow so as to come\r\njust between it and the row of corn; the other is in the form of a\r\nrolling cutter, and attached in the same way. With either of these the\r\nfarmer goes into the field as soon as the young plants can be seen in\r\nthe row, drives his team astride the row, and stirs every inch of the\r\nsoil, putting a little fresh earth around each hill of corn or potatoes\r\nwithout covering a single plant. As a single State grows some millions\r\nof acres of corn, it can be seen that the saving from this little\r\ninvention to the farmers amounts to millions of dollars in a single\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe old idea of deep cultivation of most crops has been proven to be\r\nwrong, and modern implements are made to cultivate the surface to a\r\ndepth of two or three inches rather than to tear up the roots of the\r\nplants; and one of the most perfect of all implements for this purpose\r\nis the “Planet Junior one-horse cultivator.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps no other class of machines has relieved the farmer more than\r\nthe ones for planting the grain; and with a modern two-horse corn\r\nplanter two rows can be planted at a time in checkered rows, so that\r\nit can be cultivated both ways and with more precision, both as to\r\nalignment and as to the number of plants in a hill, than by the old\r\nhand method of planting. The small grain is sown by a two-horse drill\r\narranged for not only the grain, but at the same time to deposit\r\ncommercial fertilizer along the rows of grain, and with a grass seed\r\nsower attached. In the garden a hand drill is used. It is easily\r\nadjustable to any sized seed, from that of the turnip up to beans and\r\npeas, and the seed is perfectly distributed in straight rows, while the\r\ngarden hand cultivator does away largely with the use of the hoe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOUBLE CORN CULTIVATOR.]\r\n\r\nOne other modern implement, which promises to be very useful, is “the\r\nweeder,” and its value rests on two facts which it required the farmer\r\nmany years to discover. The first is that the thorough pulverizing of\r\nthe surface, even to the depth of an inch, breaks the capillaries and\r\nchecks the evaporation of moisture; but to do this it is necessary that\r\nthe work be done just as soon after a rain as the land will crumble,\r\nand since often if a drying wind blows the land gets dry in a few\r\nhours, a machine is needed that will enable the farmer to thus stir a\r\nlarge surface in a short time; and this the weeder does, as it is made\r\nto cover the width of three rows at once, and more than two acres an\r\nhour can be stirred with a single machine. The other fact which makes\r\nthis implement of great value is that all weeds are easily exterminated\r\nwhen in embryo, and this stirring of the soil kills every one that is\r\nstarting.\r\n\r\nOne other machine which has been greatly improved is the clover huller.\r\nPrevious to its invention, most of the clover seed was sown in the\r\nchaff, and when clean seed was required it took several days’ work with\r\nfour horses to tramp out three or four bushels, and then much of the\r\nseed was left in the chaff.\r\n\r\nThe modern huller is equipped with the blower and self-feeder, and with\r\nit from twenty to fifty bushels can be hulled and cleaned in a day, the\r\namount depending on how well filled the heads are with seed.\r\n\r\nIt is quite recently that machinery has been invented that relieves the\r\nfarmer of the hard work of planting potatoes by hand, and at the same\r\ntime does the work better than the old way, as the machine drops the\r\nseed at a uniform distance apart and covers it perfectly. A man with\r\nthis machine will do the work of eight or ten men dropping by hand.\r\nSeveral potato diggers, operated by horse power, have also come into\r\nrecent use. They greatly lighten and accelerate the work, and the cost\r\nof growing potatoes has been reduced several cents a bushel by these\r\ninventions.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. IMPROVEMENT OF STOCK.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it would be well in beginning to write on this subject to ask,\r\nwhat is “pedigreed stock”? Many people have the idea that pedigreeing\r\nis an arbitrary rule adopted by stock growers to mystify the buyer and\r\nsecure larger prices for their stock. The fact is that it is intended\r\nas a protection to the purchaser, and is, or should be, a guarantee\r\nthat the stock has been bred along certain lines for a sufficient\r\nperiod to establish the desirable qualities which it is wished to\r\nperpetuate. A rigid censorship is exercised over the record books, and\r\nit makes every one recording stock, in a certain sense, a detective to\r\nsee that the records are truthful and represent the animals just as\r\nthey are.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful if along any line of farm operations there has been\r\ngreater improvement than in the breeding and care of stock; yet there\r\nwere greater difficulties to overcome in doing this than in improving\r\nthe implements. These difficulties may be classed as follows: First,\r\nthe one already alluded to in the opening chapter, to wit, the expense\r\nof importing and the consequent high price of thoroughbred animals; and\r\nwhen we recall that this was at a time when the farmers were hewing\r\nout their homes from the forest, and could not obtain large prices\r\nfor their products, it will be seen that few farmers could afford to\r\nimprove their stock. Second, as to cattle and hogs, it was almost\r\nimpossible to breed pure stock; for all animals were allowed to run\r\nat large, and the woods were full of “tramp males,” which would break\r\nthrough the fences and invade the fields where the improved stock was\r\nkept. Third, those engaged in breeding stock found that there was a\r\nlimit which when reached brought barrenness to high-bred animals, and\r\nin many other cases reduced the vitality so as to invite disease.\r\nThat this evil was a real and serious one is shown from the fact that\r\nlarge numbers of high-priced animals failed to produce young among\r\ncattle, and that many herds of pedigreed swine were carried off by\r\nepidemic diseases. Fourth, and perhaps the most serious hindrance\r\nto improvement, was the indifference of farmers and the want of\r\nappreciation of good stock, and of course the farmer who did not want\r\nit would not coöperate in producing it.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the improvement of implements and stock\r\nconsisted largely in the fact that trained mechanics were responsible\r\nfor the former, and they would perfect the implements until the farmers\r\ncould not afford to do without them; while the slipshod farmer would\r\nbe satisfied with his common stock, and would fail to accept the help\r\nof the men who were trying to improve it. Another thing which farmers\r\nlearned slowly was that good stock requires good care, which not only\r\nmeans shelter and liberal feeding, but also that the food be adapted to\r\nthe wants of the animal. More fine animals were ruined by over-feeding\r\nwith corn—a heating and fattening diet—than by insufficient food and\r\nexposure to cold and storm. It took many years to teach the farmer what\r\na balanced ration was, and why it was necessary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MODERN CLOVER HULLER.\r\n\r\nShowing Uncle Tom’s Stacker and Self-Feeder.]\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to take up each separate breed of cattle and\r\ntrace its source, giving credit to the men who improved and developed\r\nit, and the date of each importation; but the limitations of this\r\narticle forbid anything more than brief mention of the more prominent\r\nbreeds, and many which possess great merit cannot be even mentioned.\r\nThe improved cattle of the United States may be grouped under three\r\nheads—beef, dairy, and general purpose. Of the first the Short-horn\r\nholds, perhaps, the highest place, or certainly did for a long series\r\nof years. These for many years were bred under the name of “Durham,”\r\nbut about a generation ago the name began to undergo a change to\r\nShort-horn.\r\n\r\nThese animals, while especially adapted to the block, are fairly good\r\nmilkers, and some strains of them are superior dairy cows. They have\r\nthe quality of early maturity and produce a larger per cent of fine\r\ncuts of meat than most, if not any, other breeds. These cattle were\r\nfirst imported into America in 1797, and many other importations were\r\nmade during the first half of the present century.\r\n\r\nAnother breed which closely resembles the Short-horn is the Hereford.\r\nThese cattle are usually of a uniform color—a pale red—with white\r\nface, breast, and flanks, and drooping horns. They were first\r\nintroduced by Henry Clay in 1817. Another importation was made in 1840,\r\nbut it was not until 1860 and subsequently that they were imported\r\nlargely and a “herd book” established for them. Since that time they\r\nhave multiplied largely.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEREFORD COW. “LADY LAUREL.”]\r\n\r\nThe last of the three distinctly beef breeds is a hornless race\r\noriginating in Scotland, and known by the name of Aberdeen Angus,\r\nGalloway, or Polled cattle. These cattle have the distinctive quality\r\nof hardiness, and as they have very thick, close hair they are able\r\nto subsist on the range without shelter better than perhaps any other\r\nbreed. The males have a remarkable prepotency, and the cross-bred\r\nanimals very rarely show horns. Like the Herefords, they are poor\r\nmilkers; for while their milk is rich, the quantity is small, and they\r\nusually go dry for several months of the year. They were first imported\r\ninto this country about 1850, and in 1883 nine hundred were imported\r\nand distributed among the cattle breeders of the plains. Polled cattle\r\nare becoming more popular every year, and many farmers now dehorn the\r\ncattle of other breeds; and the time is not far distant when horned\r\ncattle will be the exception and not the rule.\r\n\r\nThe Channel Island group—the Jerseys, Alderneys, and\r\nGuernseys—embraces unquestionably the best butter animals of the\r\nworld; and if we are to judge by their wide distribution and great\r\npopularity, the Jerseys lead the list. They were first introduced into\r\nthe United States in 1820, and in 1850 large importations were made;\r\nbut it was during the decade from 1870 to 1880 that greatest interest\r\nin the breed was awakened and large and frequent importations were\r\nmade. There has been a strong and bitter opposition to these cattle by\r\nmany farmers on account of their small size, but they have won their\r\nway until they are more universally distributed, and are to be found\r\non more farms than any other breed. Remarkable yields of butter from\r\nthe individual have been recorded, many of them running from 12 to 18\r\npounds per week under high feeding and extra care.\r\n\r\nWhile the Ayrshire possesses great merit, so few of them have been\r\nimported into this country that it seems scarcely worth while to more\r\nthan mention them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GROUP OF ABERDEEN-ANGUS CATTLE.]\r\n\r\nUnder the head of general-purpose animals come the Holsteins, Devon,\r\nand Red Polls. All of these breeds possess fine qualities. The\r\nHolsteins were probably not introduced into this country until the last\r\nhalf of the century, and the “Holstein Herd-Book,” published in 1882,\r\nshows that about 5000 registered animals were in this country at that\r\ndate. While fair beef cattle, the Holsteins are deep milkers, and show\r\na record of the largest quantity of milk of any breed in America,—some\r\ncows giving over 12,000 pounds of milk in a year. The milk, however,\r\nis not as rich in butter fat as that of the Jersey, but probably they\r\nare the best breed of dairy cows for the cheese factory in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe Devons are beautiful red cattle. They do not rank as large\r\nmilkers, but produce a superior quality of milk, and are unexcelled\r\nin this respect by any breed but the Jersey. One peculiarity about the\r\nbreed is the comparative smallness of the cow; for while the steer will\r\nweigh from 1400 to 1600 pounds, the cows will average only from 800 to\r\n1000 pounds each.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JERSEY COW. IDA OF ST. LAMBERT.]\r\n\r\nThe importation of Red Polls from England is comparatively recent, and\r\nthey come nearer filling the idea of a general purpose animal than\r\nany other breed in America. The first importation was made in 1873,\r\nand consisted of only four animals. Two years later four more were\r\nimported, and in 1882 twenty-five. Other importations soon followed.\r\nThey are of a uniformly cherry-red color, with occasionally the tip of\r\nthe tail white or a little white about the udder. Ninety per cent of\r\nthe grades are hornless. They are of large size, mature bulls weighing\r\nfrom 1800 to 2200 pounds, and occasionally one will exceed 2500 pounds.\r\nCows weigh from 1100 to 1600 pounds, and will average 1200. That they\r\nmature early the following weights, copied from the report of the\r\nSmithfield Club, of England, will show:—\r\n\r\n    Steer, twenty-two and one half months old, weighed 1390 lbs.\r\n    Heifer, twenty-one and three quarters months old, weighed 1258 lbs.\r\n    Steer, twenty-three and one half months old, weighed 1500 lbs.\r\n    Steer, twenty-two months old, weighed 1336 lbs.\r\n\r\nAt the same show a mature cow was exhibited that weighed 1903 pounds.\r\nAs dairy cattle they show good records, giving an average of 5500\r\npounds of milk per year, and some have exceeded 500 pounds of butter in\r\na year, milking over 300 days.\r\n\r\nWhile the United States can show as good horses as any other country\r\nin the world, they are not as generally distributed among the farmers\r\nas are animals of other breeds of stock. This perhaps can be accounted\r\nfor, first, from the fact that a horse must be mature, and not less\r\nthan six years old, before it can be put on the market; and that the\r\nlow price of the service—fee of grades and scrub stallions—is too\r\ngreat a temptation to the farmer who is in debt and short of money.\r\nStill, our standard has been advancing, and there is a sure but slow\r\nbettering of the working stock of the country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POLAND-CHINA HOG.]\r\n\r\nIn the draft class we have the Norman, Percheron, Clydesdale, and\r\nBelgian, and possibly some others, while the Cleveland Bay comes as\r\nnear the general-purpose horse as any other breed. The importations\r\nthat have given us the magnificent horses which are being used in this\r\ncountry have been made chiefly from France, England, Belgium, and\r\nGermany. The blood of the English thoroughbred and of the Arab has also\r\ncontributed to the development of the qualities desired.\r\n\r\nIn no other class of stock produced in this country has the improvement\r\nbeen more marked than in the swine, and while there are probably half\r\na score of breeds in the country, a look through the markets shows\r\nthat probably 90 per cent of them are of the three following breeds:\r\nPoland-China (formerly called Magie), Berkshire, and Duroc or Jersey\r\nRed; although it is quite possible that the Chester White might take\r\nthe third place. With the exception of the Berkshire, these may be\r\ncalled distinctively American breeds, and even the Berkshire has been\r\nso modified and improved as to almost lay claim to American origin. A\r\nfew other breeds are kept pure in this country, particularly the Essex,\r\nYorkshire, and Victorias; but they are bred to but a limited extent\r\nand then for a special purpose. One thing that makes it easy and rapid\r\nto improve swine is the fact that they mature so early, and that a new\r\ncross may be made every year if desired. The writer, living in that\r\npart of Miami Valley, in Ohio, where the Poland-China swine originated,\r\nhas seen, in a quarter of a century, these hogs change in form and\r\ncolor and general characteristics, and these fixed so thoroughly that\r\nthey could be depended on to reproduce them. As this breed existed in\r\nthe fifties, they were coarse in form, mongrel in color, and slow in\r\nmaturing, requiring from eighteen months to two years to be made ready\r\nfor market. But to-day they are early maturing, can be put on the\r\nmarket at six months of age, weighing from 200 to 250 pounds, and are\r\nof uniform shape and color. They are still the leading breed throughout\r\nthe great corn belt of the United States, and the herd-books have\r\nregistered breeding stock to the number of many thousand.\r\n\r\nThe Berkshire hog was first introduced into this country in 1823, and\r\na second importation was made in 1832, but there was no systematic\r\nbreeding and care to preserve their purity, and grades were sold\r\nfor pure-bred until the breed fell into disrepute; but in 1865 new\r\nimportations were made of the finest animals to be found in England,\r\nand the merits of the breed became universally known. Though called a\r\nsmall breed, they are but little below the Poland-China in weight, and\r\ngrades from Berkshire males on large rangey sows will give the finest\r\npossible hogs for the block; but these grades must not be used for\r\nbreeding, or the stock will deteriorate.\r\n\r\nThe American Chester White hog originated in Chester County,\r\nPennsylvania; but it is believed that there was an importation of\r\nwhite hogs from England in 1818. The breed, until within less than a\r\nquarter of a century, was coarse, large of bone, and slow of maturity,\r\nand sometimes would attain enormous weight, nearly 1000 pounds; but in\r\nthe last quarter of a century they have been improved until they are a\r\nclose rival of the best breeds we have.\r\n\r\nThe Duroc-Jersey Red seems to be a distinctly American breed, having a\r\nhistory dating back to 1824, but it is less than a half century since\r\nthey came into prominence, and the improvement made in them in that\r\ntime has put them near the front rank. One thing which caused their\r\nrapid increase was the belief that they were proof against swine-plague\r\nand hog-cholera, and they were boomed on that idea. But this did not\r\nprove true, and our intelligent farmers have learned that it is not in\r\nthe breed but in the food and care that immunity from disease will be\r\nfound. These hogs are of a beautiful red color, and of good form. The\r\nmothers are prolific and good nursers, and they mature early, making\r\nthe choicest of pig pork at an early age.\r\n\r\nNo other class of animals has been subject to so much foreign\r\ncompetition or has figured to such an extent as a political factor\r\nas the sheep, and this, for more than a generation past, has kept\r\nthe sheep industry fluctuating between a depression which destroyed\r\nall profit and a boom which placed fictitious values on them, and\r\nboth extremes have worked harm to the industry. Yet through all these\r\nchanges, those who have recognized the intrinsic value of the sheep\r\nand stuck to the work of improvement, have not only found the business\r\nprofitable but have prevented the deterioration of the animals which\r\nthreatened.\r\n\r\nWhile swine are of no value until killed, the sheep gives two coupons\r\nin a year, one in the fleece and the other in the increase, and the\r\nbreeder always has two distinct objects before him,—the production\r\nof wool and mutton. The breeds of sheep are almost as dissimilar\r\nas are horses from cattle, and some are suited for hot arid lands,\r\nwhile others are adapted to the rich lowlands with their abundant\r\nand succulent herbage. The most ancient of all breeds is the Merino;\r\nand those who have studied this question trace its descent back in\r\ndirect line, probably, to the flocks of the patriarchs. For ages they\r\nhave been the clothers of mankind, first with the skin and later\r\nwith the fleece, and still they maintain a high, if not first, place\r\namong different breeds. They have been wonderfully improved, but the\r\nimprovement has been along the line of increasing the value of the\r\nfleece rather than the carcass, and it has been changed from an animal\r\nthat would produce two or three pounds of wool, and one which had bare\r\nbelly and legs, to one which produces a fleece from the hoofs to very\r\nnear the nose. It is within bounds to say the weight of the fleece has\r\nbeen doubled.\r\n\r\nWith the long-wool breeds the improvement has been designed to develop\r\nthe carcass and mutton qualities rather than the wool, and of these the\r\ntwo typical breeds are the Shropshire and Cotswold. Probably the best\r\nmutton lambs that are produced in this country are from the Shropshire\r\nrams and Merino ewes. The representative Cotswold is of majestic port\r\nand large size. The wool is curly, long, and lustrous; not dry and\r\nharsh to the touch, and has but a slight amount of yolk; at maturity it\r\nought to be eight inches long. The fleece averages six or seven pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. IMPROVEMENT IN FARMING METHODS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MERINO SHEEP.]\r\n\r\nThe improvement of methods on the farm has been discussed to some\r\nextent in speaking of implements and stock, as their use involves\r\nbetter methods; but there are other points worthy of notice. One\r\nof the most important of these is drainage. The first attempts to\r\nremove surface water from farm-land were by the construction of open\r\nditches; but as these had to follow the natural water-courses which\r\noften zigzagged through the fields, they were objectionable, not only\r\nbecause of making bad shaped lands to plow and cultivate, but also\r\nbecause they caused a waste of land, and usually had to be bridged to\r\nbe crossed with the wagons. Other objections to them were that they\r\nproduced crops of weeds to give trouble in the fields, and there was\r\na constant tendency to fill up, which soon impaired their usefulness;\r\nor, if kept cleaned out, it had to be done at heavy expense. The first\r\nattempt at underdrains, or “blind ditches,” as they were called, was by\r\nmaking an underground water-way with stone or timber; but both these\r\nmaterials were found objectionable, because such drains were easily\r\ndamaged by the action of craw-fish and rarely continued to do good work\r\nfor more than a few years. It was after the middle of the century that\r\ndrain tiles made of burnt clay were introduced, resembling good hard\r\nbrick in material; but the first drains laid were usually with tiles\r\nof too small caliber, two-inch being largely used, which were not only\r\neasily choked but failed to carry the water off rapidly enough in a\r\nwet time. Large sections of many of our States were originally swampy\r\nand so nearly level as to make it necessary to construct open ditches,\r\nalmost like canals, as an outlet for the water flowing into them from\r\nthe drains. These could not, of course, be constructed by individuals,\r\nas no man had a right to go on his neighbor’s land to open a ditch for\r\nthis purpose; so, in many cases, this was made a matter of legislation,\r\nand the large open ditches were built by taxation equitably levied on\r\nthe lands. By this means the farmers were enabled to thoroughly drain\r\nlarge areas of country which otherwise would have been nearly worthless\r\nfor agricultural purposes. In some instances the earth taken from these\r\nlarge ditches was graded up several feet high at the side, and on the\r\ntop of this levee a turnpike road was constructed, thus giving a double\r\nbenefit from a single operation. The first draining of farms was in the\r\nwet spots where, usually, a single line of tiles, laid for a moderate\r\ndistance, would bring the parts of the field under cultivation that\r\notherwise would be waste; but gradually the farmers learned that there\r\nwere other valuable effects from drainage, and that most heavy clay\r\nlands would be benefited by it sufficiently to justify the expense.\r\nThe following incidental advantages have been learned: first, drainage\r\ndeepens the soil; second, it prevents the killing out of grass and\r\ngrains during a wet season; third, it makes the land warmer; fourth,\r\nit improves the texture of the soil and makes it possible to work and\r\nplant it earlier in the spring; fifth, it prevents washing and waste\r\nof manure; sixth, it often prevents failure of crops in excessively\r\nwet seasons, and enables them to endure drought better in dry seasons.\r\nAlthough drainage is expensive it is a permanent improvement, and in\r\nmany cases the increase of the wheat crop in a single year has defrayed\r\nthe expense of tilling the land.\r\n\r\nAnother improvement, which seems to be the opposite of this, is the\r\nirrigation of arid lands in those parts of the country where the\r\nannual rainfall is small and every summer brings a drought. In these\r\ncases, water stored in large natural or artificial reservoirs, or that\r\nfurnished by snow melting on the mountains, is utilized to carry the\r\ncrops through the dry season and to enable the farmer to grow large\r\ncrops where nothing could be produced without this aid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOUBLE CORN PLANTER.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps in no other line have the methods changed for the better more\r\nthan in the care of domestic animals, and this includes both shelter\r\nand feeding. In the first half of the century, cattle and hogs were\r\nusually exposed to the severe weather of the winter with no other\r\nshelter than that afforded by a straw-stack, and this often was found\r\nleveled to the ground by the first of March, leaving them entirely\r\nwithout shelter at that changeable season of the year. They were\r\nallowed at all seasons to roam over the farm and gather their own\r\nliving, and were turned into the cornfields as soon as the ears were\r\nremoved, where they lived well as long as the stalk pasture lasted,\r\nafter which they depended on straw for food until spring; and it was\r\ncommon to have the cattle so poor, as spring approached, that many\r\ndied of actual starvation, while others became so feeble that they\r\nwould have to be lifted to help them on their feet. Then the stables\r\nfor horses were constructed apparently with the idea that ventilation\r\nwas the chief thing, and the horses stood and shivered in their stalls\r\nfrom the drafts that blew through the sides of the barn and up through\r\nthe floors of their stalls. Gradually these things have changed, until\r\nthe larger part of farm stock is warmly sheltered, and well fed with a\r\nvariety of food. Succulent food is now largely furnished from ensilage\r\npreserved in silos, from beets and other roots grown and stored for\r\nwinter use, and, more recently, from sorghum, which has been found to\r\nretain its succulence and sweetness during the entire winter. Farmers\r\nhave learned what is meant by a balanced ration, which is a combination\r\nof foods that will give the proper proportion of heat and fat producers\r\nwith those which make bone and muscle, and that it means both health\r\nand economy to substitute to a certain extent bran and oil meal for\r\ncorn, and clover hay for hay made from the grasses, and straw.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAND GARDEN PLOW.]\r\n\r\nAnother great improvement has been along the line of fencing; and, in\r\nthis respect, the most economical step of all has been in reducing the\r\namount of division fence on the farm, keeping only a portion of it\r\ndivided into fields for pasture, and leaving half or more of the best\r\nparts to be cultivated in a single inclosure on which stock is never\r\nturned. In most States, laws have been passed obliging each farmer\r\nto fence in his own stock, and no one is compelled to fence out his\r\nneighbor’s. The substitution of wire for wood as a fencing material has\r\nreduced the cost of fence construction about one half, and the waste of\r\nland occupied by fences is reduced in about the same proportion.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. IMPROVEMENT IN AND AROUND THE HOME.\r\n\r\nThe change in this direction in a single generation has been most\r\nmarked, and is one of the surest signs of prosperity. The log cabin has\r\ngiven place to a substantial and, in many cases, an elegant home. The\r\nirregular and ill-shaped yards, fenced with rails, which surrounded\r\nboth house and barn, and in which hogs and cattle were kept, with\r\nno shelter but a rail pen with straw roof, have disappeared, and\r\nrectangular lots enclosed with neat fences and good barns and piggeries\r\nhave taken their place. The wood-pile has retired from the front yard,\r\nand is now sheltered in a woodshed adjoining the kitchen; and a neat\r\nlawn with flowers and shrubbery is no longer the exception, but the\r\nrule. A good garden, in which the newer and improved vegetables have\r\ntaken the place of the old sorts, and a berry patch, well cared for,\r\nafford the luxuries which they alone can give for a period of many\r\nweeks each season. The water is no longer carried from a remote spring,\r\nbut good wells and cisterns are placed conveniently, many of them so\r\nthat the pump is in the kitchen or under a porch attached to the house.\r\nThe cellar is usually floored with cement, and the stairs leading to\r\nit are of easy grade; while good walks of plank or cement make it a\r\npleasure to pass from the house to the surrounding outbuildings.\r\n\r\nAnother line in which very great improvement is shown is in maintaining\r\nthe fertility of the soil. The old method was to exhaust the fertility\r\nof a field and then clear a new one; and it is doubtful if one farmer\r\nin a hundred could have answered the question, “Why does land become\r\nsterile after long cultivation?” for they had no conception of what\r\nthe chemical elements of the soil were which are necessary to its\r\nfertility. There are two theories of fertilizing and fertility: one,\r\nthat the soil is a mine to be worked out, and which will inevitably\r\nbecome unproductive in the process; the other, that it is a laboratory\r\nin which, under the intelligent management of man, forces can be set at\r\nwork which will maintain and develop a perpetual fertility. Malthus,\r\nmore than a century ago, announced that the time would come before long\r\nwhen the people of the earth would starve because they had outgrown\r\nthe fertility of the soil and its productive capacity; but after long\r\ncultivation, we find it possible to produce on less than half the\r\ncultivatable land enough not only to feed our own nation, but the\r\nworld at large, and there is no questioning the accurateness of the\r\nlaboratory theory as opposed to the mine theory.\r\n\r\nThe first improvement along this line was in the better saving and\r\nutilizing of animal manures; but when it was found that these were\r\ninsufficient, science came to the help of the farmer. The chemist\r\nanalyzed both crop and soils, ascertaining what was needed, and then\r\nthe world was searched for the materials necessary. The elements which\r\nformed our plants were found to be fifteen in number, but of these\r\nit was found that it was necessary to furnish only three,—nitrogen,\r\nphosphoric acid, and potash. Nitrogen was known to exist in\r\ninexhaustible quantities in the atmosphere, forming seventy-six per\r\ncent of its composition; but the question was long unsolved: “Can\r\ngrowing plants appropriate atmospheric nitrogen?” Finally, it was\r\ndiscovered that plants of the Leguminosæ family—of which clover\r\nis the best type and of greatest value for this purpose to the\r\nfarmer—could appropriate nitrogen from the atmosphere; and after\r\ncareful research, with the aid of the microscope, it was discovered\r\nthat this appropriation came about through the agency of bacteria\r\nin the roots. This fact connected with the clover plant is one of\r\nimmense importance to the farmer, because nitrogen is not only the most\r\nexpensive element of fertility to purchase, but is likely to be lost\r\nboth through evaporation and leaching. So it can be seen that clover is\r\none of the most valuable plants which can be grown on the farm, for\r\nthe reason that the crop can be utilized as food for stock, while still\r\ngreat benefit inures to the soil, as the fertility is largely stored in\r\nthe roots, which cannot be used for any other purpose, and as by the\r\naction of these roots the mechanical condition of the soil is greatly\r\nimproved. Further, the dense shade the plant affords induces chemical\r\naction in the soil, which makes plant food available that would\r\notherwise remain inert. One of the most wonderful things connected with\r\nfertility is that God has so locked it up in the earth that no greedy\r\ngeneration can exhaust it, and that the greatest source of fertility is\r\nthe atmosphere, whose secrets are just being discovered.\r\n\r\nAn English scientist has recently announced that by the aid of\r\nelectricity, furnished by cheap water-power, nitrates can be\r\nmanufactured directly from the atmosphere so as to reduce their cost\r\nto less than one fourth what it has heretofore been. Again, the\r\nintelligent use of clover will enable the farmer to produce his own\r\nnitrogen and reduce the cost of chemical fertilizers to one half what\r\nit usually is when containing nitrogen. This brings us to the question\r\nof commercial fertilizers. With the single exception of guano, they are\r\na product of the last third of the century. The first step toward the\r\nuse of commercial fertilizers was by analyzing our barnyard manures.\r\nWhen the chemist discovered that a ton or more which the farmer drew\r\nout laboriously with two horses to the field contained but twenty\r\nor thirty pounds of actual plant food,—the remainder being water,\r\nsand, and other dead matter,—the next step was to combine the three\r\nelements essential to a perfect fertilizer in such proportions that a\r\nsingle sack would hold enough manure for an acre of ground; and in tens\r\nof thousands of cases, the application of this amount of fertilizer\r\nhas increased the wheat crop from five to fifteen bushels per acre,\r\ndoubling the grass crop which followed, which in turn, and through\r\nthe influence of the fertilizer, formed a sward which, by its decay,\r\nfertilized a third crop when it was turned under in the rotation.\r\n\r\nThe element in fertilizers of next importance to nitrogen is phosphoric\r\nacid, and the first source from which this was obtained was the bones\r\nof animals. But the supply from animals slaughtered was entirely\r\ninsufficient; and so the great plains of the West were gleaned, and\r\ntens of thousands of tons of buffalo bones were gathered and shipped\r\nEast to fertilize our farms. But soon this source began to wane; then\r\ntwo other sources, practically inexhaustible, of this indispensable\r\nelement were discovered,—the phosphate rocks of the South and the\r\niron slag from furnaces, each of which is found to contain a large per\r\ncent of phosphoric acid; and when the rock is dissolved by acids and\r\nthe slag ground to an impalpable powder by machinery, the fertilizing\r\nelements in both are found to be as available and valuable as that from\r\nbones. The supply of potash was obtained at first from wood ashes,\r\nwhich the clearing of the farms and the universal use of wood as fuel\r\nmade abundant. But later, when these sources were no longer sufficient,\r\npotash salts were found in large quantities where they could be mined\r\nfrom the earth, so that now there seems to be in sight an inexhaustible\r\nsupply of the elements needed for plant food. Like almost every reform,\r\nthe use of commercial fertilizers was opposed bitterly by many farmers,\r\nand statements were made by them that their effects on the soil were\r\nlike those of whiskey or other stimulants on the body, and that the\r\nultimate result of their use would be that the soil would become\r\nbarren. Many refused, to use them at all; others, after a single trial\r\nmade without intelligence, denounced them as humbugs. But as they\r\nsaw on the farms of their neighbors the wonderful results from their\r\nuse, they have been gradually led to adopt them, until now, with most\r\nfarmers, the question no longer is, “Can I afford to use commercial\r\nfertilizers?” but rather, “Can I afford to do without them?”\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. IMPROVEMENT IN AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION.\r\n\r\nTo one who has followed the writer to this point, it must be apparent\r\nthat the farmer of to-day has made progress in the knowledge of\r\nhis calling to at least as great an extent as he has improved in\r\nhis methods, and that the terms “farm drudge” and “clodhopper” are\r\nmisapplied and should be obsolete. There is no other industrial calling\r\nin which one touches nature and science at so many points, or which\r\ngives such good opportunities to develop the perfect man,—“the sound\r\nmind in the sound body,”—as that of the farmer. Admitting that not\r\nall farmers understand this and live up to their privileges, does not\r\nalter the fact that the farm offers a great opportunity to develop and\r\nbroaden the mind; that the last quarter of the century has brought into\r\nactive operation forces which have touched and influenced a large per\r\ncent of the tillers of the soil; and that the leaven of education is\r\nworking mightily. The intelligent, studious farmer becomes a practical\r\nbotanist as he studies the growth and habits of plants. As he is\r\ndependent more than any other man upon the weather and must change\r\nhis plans frequently to correspond with climatic changes, he becomes\r\na meteorologist. Myriads of insects, which include both enemies and\r\nfriends, make him a student of entomology; and the wonderful alchemy\r\nof the soil by which offensive and poisonous matters are transmuted\r\ninto golden grain, luscious fruits, vegetables, and flowers, calls for\r\na knowledge of chemistry. The use of modern machinery develops his\r\nmechanical powers; and the man on the farm develops in more directions\r\nand has an opportunity to acquire a broader education than any other\r\nman who earns his living by his own labor. To sustain this statement,\r\nit is only necessary to enumerate the educational opportunities and\r\nprivileges now open to the farmer and which are, to a great extent,\r\nutilized by him. First, what the government is doing for him. No\r\nother calling is represented in the cabinet of the President, and\r\ntime and experience have demonstrated the wisdom of a Secretary of\r\nAgriculture. Not only are we distinctively an agricultural people,\r\nbut the prosperity of the nation depends on the intelligence and\r\nprosperity of the farmer more than on all other classes combined. Not\r\nonly must the food supply of our people be furnished, but the foreign\r\ndemand must be met; and this gives to the farmers money to spend, so\r\nthat the industries which contribute to their wants shall share in the\r\ngeneral prosperity. While there are many honorable and useful callings,\r\nagriculture seems to be the only one which touches and affects all\r\nothers. The financial importance of agriculture is shown by the fact\r\nthat, after the wants of the nation were supplied, in the year 1897 we\r\nexported in round numbers $690,000,000 worth of agricultural products,\r\nor nearly 67 per cent of the entire exports; and notwithstanding an\r\nenormous increase of imports of wool and sugar, in anticipation of\r\nincreased duties, the balance of trade on agricultural products for\r\nthe year was $289,000,000, and the export of agricultural products for\r\nthe current fiscal year would show still larger figures.\r\n\r\nConsidering the specific educational influences which are elevating\r\nthe farmer and his calling, we enumerate the following: Agricultural\r\nliterature, farmers’ organizations,—including farmers’ clubs, farmers’\r\ninstitutes, and the Grange,—agricultural experiment stations, and\r\nagricultural colleges, all of which have contributed their share to the\r\nintelligence and prosperity of the farmer, and all are products of the\r\nlast half of the century. To give an intelligent idea of the help which\r\nthese influences have brought to the farmer, it is necessary to treat\r\nthem to some extent in detail. First, agricultural literature. All that\r\nis necessary to an understanding of the progress in this direction is\r\nto get one of the very few so-called agricultural papers of fifty years\r\nago and compare it with those of to-day. Not only have they multiplied\r\na hundredfold, but while the former largely contained stilted\r\narticles written by theorists, to-day every page is full of practical\r\ninstruction written by farmers, and often by specialists who have spent\r\nyears in improving some line of farming or stock breeding. Most of\r\nour agricultural papers have a staff of paid contributors, nearly all\r\nof whom have made a success in some branch of farming; and so anxious\r\nare the publishers of these papers to give their readers all the help\r\npossible, that they search out the men who are prospering on the\r\nfarm and engage their services as instructors for their readers. The\r\njournals devoted to agriculture are numbered by hundreds, some of them\r\ndevoted to a single line,—such as sheep, poultry, or gardening,—and\r\nothers with well classified departments which give instruction on all\r\npoints. In addition to this, nearly all of the weeklies have a page of\r\nagriculture, usually conducted by a farmer or some one with practical\r\nknowledge of farm work. There are no secrets in agriculture, and every\r\nfarmer is ready to impart to all any valuable information he acquires.\r\nFarmers appreciate the value of these helps and make large use of them,\r\nand the circulation of these papers is enormous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUCCESS ANTI-CLOG WEEDER.]\r\n\r\nBy Farmers’ Clubs we mean those organizations of farmers, governed by\r\nconstitutions and by-laws, who meet at stated times for the discussion\r\nof topics connected with the improvement of their calling. There are\r\nno statistics available from which can be gathered the extent of\r\nthis movement, but Ohio reports fifty clubs and has formed a state\r\norganization. In Michigan, where the clubs are organized on a different\r\nbasis, 30,000 members are reported; they have also formed a state\r\norganization, which was attended by 200 delegates at the last meeting.\r\nIndiana is but little, if any, behind these two States, and the club\r\nidea is rapidly spreading through the Northern States. There are two\r\nforms of these clubs, one of which limits the membership to twelve\r\nfamilies, and the meetings are all held at the homes of the members,\r\none each month. The advantages of this plan are several. First,\r\nwith the club thus limited, the horses can be stabled and cared for\r\nduring inclement weather of winter. Second, the wives need prepare\r\nbut one meal in the year for the club; while with the large club it\r\nis necessary that each should contribute to a basket dinner for every\r\nmeeting, which often causes as much trouble as to prepare the meal for\r\nthe entire club once a year. Third, the attendance is sure to be more\r\nregular in the small club, and one condition of membership is that\r\nevery member shall be present at each meeting unless providentially\r\ndetained. Fourth, with a club of this size every member can take part\r\nin the discussion, and there will be less danger of a few “talkers”\r\nmonopolizing the time. Fifth, the social features in the small club\r\nare very much better than in the large. Most of the clubs in Ohio and\r\nIndiana are organized on this basis, while in Michigan it is probable\r\nthat most of the clubs have an unlimited membership. The objection is\r\nsometimes urged that the small club seems selfish, but as any twelve or\r\neven six families are at liberty to organize a club this objection is\r\nnot valid.\r\n\r\nAs many farmers who would like to organize may not be able to find a\r\nform of constitution and by-laws, it seems proper to give one here.\r\n\r\n    _Preamble._\r\n\r\n    Recognizing the fact that farmers need an opportunity to\r\n    compare methods and to cultivate their social qualities, and\r\n    considering that “As iron sharpeneth iron, so a man sharpeneth\r\n    the countenance of his friend,” in order that we may be mutually\r\n    helpful to each other in matters relating to husbandry, home\r\n    comfort, and economy, we do form ourselves into an association\r\n    known as the —— Farmers’ Club [fill the blank with the name\r\n    you wish to use for your club], and adopt for our government the\r\n    following:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Constitution._\r\n\r\n    _Article 1._ The officers shall be President, Vice-President,\r\n    Secretary, Treasurer, and Librarian, who shall be elected\r\n    annually in November, and assume their duties in January of the\r\n    following year.\r\n\r\n    _Article 2._ The duties of these officers shall be such as\r\n    pertain to the offices in other organizations and are indicated\r\n    by the name of the office.\r\n\r\n    _Article 3._ The active members of this club shall be engaged in\r\n    agricultural pursuits, but honorary members may be elected by\r\n    unanimous vote. Honorary members are not obliged to attend all\r\n    the meetings, but will be welcomed to any.\r\n\r\n    _Article 4._ Application for membership must be submitted at the\r\n    meeting previous to their being balloted for, and members will\r\n    be admitted on receiving a two-thirds vote by ballot; but the\r\n    membership shall be limited to twelve families.\r\n\r\n    _Article 5._ Amendments may be made at any regular meeting by a\r\n    two-thirds vote of the active members.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _By-laws._\r\n\r\n    1. The club shall meet at the residence of one of the members on\r\n    the third Thursday of each month, at ten o’clock, invitations to\r\n    which shall be limited to the hostess of the day.\r\n\r\n    2. The club shall be called to order by the president, after an\r\n    hour spent in social intercourse, and the order of exercises\r\n    shall be as follows:—\r\n\r\n    _a._ Reading and approving minutes of last meeting.\r\n\r\n    _b._ Monthly record of current events.\r\n\r\n    _c._ Selections, recitations, essays.\r\n\r\n    _d._ Adjournment for dinner and social intercourse until two\r\n    o’clock.\r\n\r\n    _e._ Discussion; so conducted as to avoid all questions of\r\n    politics and theology.\r\n\r\n    _f._ Question drawer.\r\n\r\n    _g._ Miscellaneous business.\r\n\r\n    In order that the work of the club may be systematic and the\r\n    time fully occupied, a programme covering the entire year is\r\n    prepared and printed so as to be ready for distribution at the\r\n    December meeting of each year. That the reader may understand the\r\n    working of this plan, a few topics will be given, taken from the\r\n    programme of the club of which the writer is a member:—\r\n\r\n  January.\r\n\r\n  The club will meet at the home of Mr. ........\r\n\r\n  Thursday, the 19th.\r\n\r\n  Selection .......................         Mrs. ........\r\n\r\n  Paper ...........................         Mr. .........\r\n\r\n    _Topic_: A review of the previous year.\r\n\r\n    Each member will give in writing a statement of profits and\r\n    losses for the year under the following heads:—\r\n\r\n  1. General crops grown and acreage and yield thereof.\r\n  2. What special crops have been raised.\r\n  3. Stock raised or handled.\r\n  4. What experiments have been made on the farm.\r\n  5. What losses of stock, or crops, and the cause thereof.\r\n\r\n  June.\r\n\r\n  The club will meet at the home of Mr. ........\r\n\r\n  Thursday, the 15th.\r\n\r\n  Selection ......................            Mrs. ........\r\n\r\n  Paper: “Hindrances to sheep raising and how to avoid them.”\r\n                                              Mr. .........\r\n\r\n    _Topic_: The Farmer’s Barn.\r\n\r\n  1. Relative size to farm.\r\n  2. Location and ground plan.\r\n  3. Arrangement of stabling, feeding, and water conveniences.\r\n  4. Plan for saving manure.\r\n\r\nEither a gentleman or a lady is appointed to open each topic, after\r\nwhich the subject is opened for question or discussion by any member\r\nof the club. During one month of the summer, usually July or August, a\r\npicnic takes the place of the regular meeting, at which a basket dinner\r\nis served.\r\n\r\nFarmers’ institutes are, in the best sense of the word, a farmers’\r\nschool, and while it is less than twenty years since their first\r\norganization, nearly all of the States, at least in the North, are\r\nconducting them to a greater or less extent. As Ohio claims the honor\r\nof inaugurating this movement, and the writer is more familiar with the\r\nplan of organization and the work of institutes in that State than any\r\nother, some facts concerning them will be given. The first attempt to\r\nteach the farmers by lecture courses was made late in the seventies at\r\nthe Ohio State Agricultural College, when a course of eighty lectures\r\non subjects connected with farm interests were given, all of them by\r\nprofessors of the college. This first course occupied five weeks; and\r\nas it was found that but a limited number of farmers could be induced\r\nto leave their homes and care of their stock in the winter, and that\r\nthe attendance was only about forty, the next two years the course was\r\nshortened in hopes that a larger attendance might result, but such was\r\nnot the case. Then some one suggested, “If the farmers will not come\r\nto the lectures, why not take the lectures to the farmers?” and the\r\noutcome of this suggestion has been a wonderful success; the State\r\nholding three hundred institutes in the winter of 1897 and 1898, under\r\na law providing a fund for that purpose, and over a hundred independent\r\ninstitutes in addition, by which is meant institutes in which the local\r\norganization pays its own expenses and chooses its own lecturers and\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\nThe work in most of our States is thoroughly organized, a fund provided\r\nto meet the expenses of the work, placed in some States under the\r\ncharge of the Secretary of Agriculture, and in others in charge of a\r\nsuperintendent of institutes. The farmers have met this effort for\r\ntheir improvement with great enthusiasm, and the attendance is usually\r\nlimited by the size of the hall provided. All partisan and sectarian\r\nquestions are rigorously excluded from the discussions. A bulletin is\r\nissued in the fall, which gives the names of a large corps of lecturers\r\nand a list of subjects, and these are sent to the officers of the local\r\norganizations, from which they can select such topics as they wish\r\ndiscussed. Half of the time of each session is allotted to the state\r\nlecturers, while local talent is expected to fill the other half. The\r\ngreatest possible freedom is allowed in asking questions and discussing\r\nthe work of the speakers, and no other educational influence which has\r\ncome to the farmer has equaled that offered by these meetings. At the\r\nclose of each year the best papers and discussions are printed in a\r\nbulletin for free distribution among the farmers, and are given out\r\nat the meeting the ensuing year, or are mailed from the office of the\r\nSecretary of the State Board of Agriculture on application.\r\n\r\nThe Grange was organized at Washington, D. C., in 1807, but existed\r\nonly on paper until January, 1873, when the first meeting of the\r\nNational Grange convened at Georgetown, D. C., with delegates from ten\r\nStates. It was started as a secret society, with a ritual and degrees,\r\nand seemed to catch the popular fancy among the farmers. At the meeting\r\nof the National Grange in 1874, thirty-two States were represented.\r\n\r\nProbably no other organization has made so rapid a growth as this.\r\nA large element, however, of the membership was attracted to it by\r\nthe rallying cry of “Down with the middleman!” and had little or no\r\nconception of its educational possibilities. Little country stores\r\nwith very small capital, and managed by men with no business training,\r\nsprang up at every cross-road, which, contrary to the expectation of\r\ntheir founders, did not save money, but resulted in some valuable\r\nbusiness education for which a good tuition fee was paid. The reaction\r\nwhich set in made it seem for a time as though the entire order would\r\ndisintegrate; but fortunately there were wise leaders who had caught\r\nthe true idea, that the organization must be kept on an educational\r\nbasis to save it from extinction, and through their efforts it has\r\nbecome a power for good in most localities, and has been of great\r\nservice to the farmers. County, state, and national societies have been\r\norganized, and no other large bodies of farmers can so quickly and\r\nthoroughly coöperate in measures pertaining to the interests of the\r\nfarmer as those belonging to this order.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ASPINWALL POTATO PLANTER.]\r\n\r\nAnother educational force of immense value to the farmers is found in\r\nthe experiment stations, which are established in every State of the\r\nUnion. This work was started by an act of Congress, approved March 2,\r\n1887, and known as the “Hatch Act.” By this act the sum of $15,000 per\r\nannum was appropriated for each State in the Union, to be specially\r\nprovided by Congress in the appropriations from year to year. In\r\naddition to this sum, most of the States have made large appropriations\r\nfor the purchase of suitable grounds and the erection of buildings, and\r\nto cover the expense of printing the reports and pamphlets which are\r\nsent out free to the farmers who apply for them.\r\n\r\nTo go a little farther, the questions requiring investigation by the\r\nagricultural experiment stations may be divided into three principal\r\ngroups, according as they are related to the soil, to the growth of\r\ncrops and vegetation, or to domestic animals and their products.\r\n\r\nI. The soil is studied—\r\n\r\n(1) In its varieties, as found in different parts of the farm and of\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\n(2) In its physical properties, as affected by tillage, drainage,\r\nirrigation, etc.\r\n\r\n(3) In its chemical properties, as related to the maintenance of\r\nfertility by the use of fertilizers and otherwise.\r\n\r\nII. In vegetation and crop production some of the objects of study\r\nare:—\r\n\r\n(1) Varieties, including the selection and dissemination of new sorts;\r\nthe elimination of synonyms; the comparison of strains of varieties;\r\nthe production of improved varieties, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n(2) Vegetable pathology, including studies of rusts, smuts, blights,\r\nrots, mildews, etc.\r\n\r\n(3) Control of injurious insects.\r\n\r\n(4) Forestry, embracing the culture of forest trees for wind-breaks,\r\nfor timber, for nuts and incidental products.\r\n\r\nIII. In the study of animals some of the problems are:—\r\n\r\n(1) Breeds and their comparative values for different purposes.\r\n\r\n(2) Foods and feeding, for growth, for meat, for milk and wool.\r\n\r\n(3) The diseases of animals, especially those of contagious, epizootic,\r\nor parasitic nature.\r\n\r\nThe stations have done most valuable work along these different\r\nlines, and have contributed in a large measure to the introduction of\r\nimproved varieties of cereals, forage crops, and fruits. In the case of\r\nwheat especially, there can be no doubt that the work of the stations\r\nhas been a factor of great importance in producing large yields, by\r\nstimulating the farmers to a more careful comparison of varieties and\r\nof methods of culture.\r\n\r\nA plan of purchasing and testing most of the so-called new varieties\r\nof fruits and grains has been followed by some of the stations, thus\r\nenabling the farmers and fruit growers to judge whether such varieties\r\nare likely to be superior to sorts already cultivated. It has been\r\npart of the work of the stations to expose fraudulent sales of fruit,\r\nstock, and fertilizers. Much other work has been and is being done,\r\nbut the instances given show the value of the investigations made. As\r\nhas already been stated under another heading, the officers of the\r\nexperiment stations take an active part in the work of the institutes,\r\nand by the frequent issuing of bulletins and their annual reports\r\nconvey valuable information to the farmer in every department of\r\nhis work. In many States they have established reading courses for\r\nthe study of Nature, which are conducted similarly to those in the\r\nChautauqua courses.\r\n\r\nIn the same connection the work of the Bureau of Animal Industry\r\nshould be noticed. Possibly no other organization of the government is\r\ndoing so much to save farmers from loss through disease of stock and\r\neducating them to the same extent as this. The organization is made up\r\nof men of the highest scientific training, whose lives are devoted to\r\nthe study of diseases of domestic animals and whose work extends to\r\nthe testing of remedies, the inspection of meats, the study of foreign\r\nmarkets, and everything that pertains to the interest of the stock\r\ngrowers. No disease can break out in the herds of live stock in any\r\npart of the country without this bureau being at once notified of it,\r\nand trained officials are sent to study all the circumstances connected\r\nwith it and to prevent, if possible, such disease from becoming\r\nepidemic. Some years ago, when contagious pleuro-pneumonia had secured\r\na foothold in this country, the Bureau of Animal Industry set to work\r\nto stamp it out. The Old World was paralyzed by the enormity of the\r\nundertaking. Veterinarians in England and Continental Europe laughed at\r\nus and considered us fit subjects for lunatic asylums. “Hadn’t _they_\r\nalways had it? It cost them millions of dollars annually in cattle, yet\r\nthey had been unable to stamp it out, and most assuredly we could not\r\ndo what European veterinarians could not.” They forgot that we were\r\nYankees. It cost us many good hard dollars that were represented by\r\nlarge figures; but we stamped it out, and it has now been years since\r\n“Uncle Sam” officially declared the country free from it.\r\n\r\nAnother work which this bureau undertook was the regulation of vessels\r\nin which cattle were exported, and they reduced the losses so as to\r\nsave from two to three million dollars annually in the insurance\r\nof export cattle. The greatest possible care is taken to disinfect\r\nvessels in which cattle have been shipped, and strict regulations are\r\nestablished regulating the size of stalls, ventilation, the number of\r\ncattle to be carried on any single vessel, and every point which has a\r\nbearing on the health and comfort of the animals.\r\n\r\nIt was not until after the Civil War that such a thing as an\r\nagricultural college was known in this country, but through the action\r\nof Congress very liberal appropriations were made, which in most\r\nStates were supplemented by the action of the State Legislatures,\r\nand an agricultural college was started in every State of the Union.\r\nIn the beginning there was much criticism, and without doubt many\r\nmistakes were made by those to whom the work was assigned; but now\r\nthat a generation has passed, the farmers have come to understand\r\nbetter the objects of these schools, and scientific men have been\r\ntrained to do the work; and these men have gone out into other\r\ndepartments, such as those already described, and have made possible\r\nthe splendid achievements which have already been hinted at in what\r\nhas been written. The teachers and officials of these colleges have\r\nbeen exceedingly friendly to everything that could help the farmers,\r\nand are in close touch with them; aiding in the work of local, state,\r\nand national organizations, and, in most States, carrying on the work\r\nof the experiment stations through their professors and graduates; and\r\nin many of them courses of lectures by practical farmers have been\r\nestablished. Without question they are becoming more and more helpful\r\nas the years go by, and their power for good is constantly increasing.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SUMMING UP.\r\n\r\nWhat has agriculture gained, or rather along what lines, in the\r\ncentury’s progress? A brief summary would seem a fitting close of this\r\nchapter:—\r\n\r\n(1) The marvelous advance in methods and means of transportation, and\r\nthe consequent opening of the markets of the world.\r\n\r\n(2) The knowledge of the chemical constituents of the soil and its\r\nmanagement in the line of maintaining fertility.\r\n\r\n(3) The appliances to lighten labor and shorten processes in the\r\nproduction and harvesting of crops.\r\n\r\n(4) Increased knowledge of plants, as to their growth and cultivation,\r\ntheir feeding qualities, and the combination of these qualities in\r\nfeeding our domestic animals, by which we are able to reduce the\r\ncost of production through the early maturity of the animals and the\r\nmaintaining of vigorous health.\r\n\r\n(5) Increased knowledge of the value and power of organization and of\r\nagricultural literature in helping to a practical education for the\r\nduties of the farm.\r\n\r\n(6) In an increase of home comforts and a higher ideal of living,\r\nand an appreciation of the fact that the work of the farm should be\r\nsubservient to the life on the farm, as “The life is more than meat,\r\nand the body than raiment.”\r\n\r\n(7) In no other country on the globe are there so many tillers of the\r\nsoil who own their homes, and, as a consequence, there is no country\r\nwhere there is so much of patriotism. When Matthew Arnold visited\r\nthe United States, nothing that he saw delighted him more than the\r\nbeautiful farms, with their comfortable dwellings and outbuildings and\r\nthe evidences of high cultivation and fertility. But one thing puzzled\r\nhim, and that was the absence of tenant houses, and he asked, “Where\r\ndo the men live who cultivate these farms?” When told that in most\r\ncases the farmers were their own tenants, he could scarcely express his\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\nPrince Kropotkin, of Russia, who has traveled in this country and paid\r\nparticular attention to the condition of agriculture, says in his\r\nsumming up: “American agriculture offers an imposing sight; not in the\r\nwheat fields of the far West, which will soon become a thing of the\r\npast, but by the development of rational agriculture and of the forces\r\nwhich promote it. Read the description of an agricultural exhibition in\r\na small town in Iowa, with 70,000 farmers camping with their families\r\nin tents during the fair week, studying, learning, buying and selling,\r\nand enjoying life. You see a national fête, and you feel that you deal\r\nwith a nation in which agriculture is held in respect. Or read the\r\npublications of the scores of experiment stations, whose reports are\r\npublished by thousands and scattered broadcast over the country, and\r\nare read by the farmers and discussed at countless farmers’ meetings,\r\nand you will feel that American agriculture is a real force, imbued\r\nwith life, which no longer fears mammoth farms, and needs not, like a\r\nchild, cry for protection.”\r\n\r\nThe future of agriculture in this country seems safe, and no class of\r\nmen can look the future in the face with more of confidence than those\r\nwho till the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGRESS IN CIVIL ENGINEERING\r\n\r\nBY WALTER LORING WEBB, C.E.,\r\n\r\n_Assistant Prof. of Civil Engineering, University of Pennsylvania_.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. AN INTRODUCTORY VIEW.\r\n\r\nIf we broadly define civil engineering as the art of construction, then\r\nthe birth of the art is as old as the emergence of man from savagery.\r\nThe savage who hollows out a log of wood in order to construct a canoe\r\nhas taken the first step in the art of shipbuilding; and when he has\r\nconstructed a hut, however rude, to take the place, as an abode, of\r\nthe cave hollowed out by nature, he has moved one step nearer to those\r\ntriumphs of building construction which satisfy man’s necessities,\r\ncomforts, and æsthetic desires. From this standpoint civil engineering\r\nis as old as the oldest of the arts and sciences. Not only is civil\r\nengineering an ancient art, but when the archæologist points to some\r\nof the masterpieces of building construction which have been literally\r\nhidden from view by the débris of centuries, and describes the old\r\nroads which the disintegrating forces of nature, working for centuries,\r\nhave not been able to destroy, it is natural to assume that in many\r\nfeatures the civil engineering of the present day is but a copy of\r\nancient work, or, at least, that there has been comparatively little\r\nreal progress. It may be claimed that bridges are very old, that\r\ncanals, lighthouses, and roads antedate the Christian era, and that\r\neven the ancient Egyptians knew that the earth is round, and had made\r\na rough computation of its diameter. But it will be shown that even\r\nin these cases there has been an enormous advance, not only in the\r\ncharacter and magnitude of the work done, but also in another feature\r\nof civil engineering which is frequently overlooked, namely, the\r\n_economy_ of labor and material. Civil engineering has been defined as\r\nthe art of doing well with one dollar what any bungler can do somehow\r\nwith two dollars. This definition, although very loose and one-sided,\r\nnevertheless contains a very important truth. If by improved methods a\r\ncanal or a bridge can be constructed for one half to one third of what\r\nit would have cost by older methods, then the world has advanced, in\r\nthat it may have two or three canals or bridges at the same cost of\r\nlabor as would have been previously required for the construction of\r\none. When we add to this a vast improvement in quality, an improvement\r\nthat would have been previously impossible at any cost, the world’s\r\nadvance is hardly measurable by any standard. It is a well-known fact\r\nthat many engineering works, justly considered masterpieces at the\r\ntime of their construction, could now be replaced by a much better\r\nstructure for a comparatively small part of their original cost. This\r\nstatement not only applies to very old constructions, but even to some\r\nof the great engineering works of the latter half of this century. Some\r\nof these reconstructions have actually occurred, as is illustrated in\r\nthe Victoria tubular bridge at Montreal, or the Roebling suspension\r\nbridge at Niagara Falls,—described later. In fact, the progress in\r\ncivil engineering during the nineteenth century is chiefly made up of\r\nthe enormous advances which have been made during the latter half of\r\nthe century. It should not be argued that these recent constructions\r\nare cheaper, because “everything is cheaper now.” The general scale\r\nof wages has advanced, and the total cost of construction is cheaper,\r\nonly because improved methods of work have reduced the labor required\r\nto produce finished building material from the raw product and to erect\r\nthat material into a structure. Therefore in considering in detail\r\nthe construction of the great masterpieces of this century, we should\r\nnot lose sight of the enormous advance in general methods of work,\r\nwhich has rendered it possible to have all of these structures which\r\nso minister to the prosperity of the world, at such a reduced cost in\r\nlabor.\r\n\r\nA complete discussion of the century’s progress in civil engineering\r\nwould require a treatise on all modern practice as well as a\r\ndescription of nearly all of the great engineering masterpieces in\r\nexistence, but the limitations of this article utterly preclude the\r\npossibility of even a short discussion of all the branches of the\r\nscience, to say nothing of a detailed description of all of the\r\nexamples. The following discussion will therefore be confined to those\r\nbranches in which the advance has been most notable, even to the\r\nunscientific reader, the progress being illustrated by brief statements\r\nregarding the most typical constructions.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. BRIDGES.\r\n\r\nNot only is there evidence that bridges of the simplest forms have\r\nbeen used from prehistoric times, but the engineering world has been\r\nfrequently surprised at the discovery, in semi-barbarous lands where\r\nthere was evidently no scientific knowledge of bridge construction,\r\nof a bridge which, in its mechanical analysis, is a rude example of\r\nsome one of the more complicated types now in use. But these bridges\r\nare always small, and are constructed with an utter disregard of that\r\neconomy of construction which is one of the great triumphs of modern\r\nbridge engineering, being uselessly strong in some parts, considering\r\ntheir weakness in others. At the beginning of this century there was\r\nnot a wrought-iron or steel bridge in existence. Disregarding stone\r\narches for the present, all other bridges were made of wood—with the\r\nexception of a few bridges of cast iron, which were constructed during\r\nthe latter part of the eighteenth century. But cast-iron is unsuitable\r\nfor pieces requiring tensile strength; it is also difficult to cast\r\nvery large pieces with any assurance of uniformity. The best existing\r\nexamples of cast-iron bridges are, therefore, those of the arch type;\r\nbut these are very heavy in proportion to their real strength, and\r\nwould now be much more costly than, as well as inferior to, steel\r\nbridges of equal strength. Therefore the great advance in bridge\r\nwork during this century consists in the development of steel bridge\r\nconstruction, and a brief description will be given of a few bridges\r\nwhich represent the chief types.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BROOKLYN SUSPENSION BRIDGE.]\r\n\r\nBROOKLYN BRIDGE.—The suspension bridge between New York and Brooklyn\r\nis the largest bridge of its kind in existence, and, until the\r\nconstruction of the “Forth” bridge, was the longest clear span ever\r\nbuilt. Every one is so familiar with this stupendous structure that\r\nonly a few statements will be made, which may give a better idea of\r\nthe unprecedented problem which confronted the great engineer, John\r\nA. Roebling. When looking at the exceedingly graceful design of the\r\ntowers, one is apt to forget that a large part of the structure\r\nof each tower is hidden from view. The bottom of the foundation of\r\nthe pier, on the New York side, is 78 feet below mean high tide, and\r\nspreads over an area 172 feet long and 102 feet wide. The pressure\r\nexerted by the caisson on its base is about 114,000 tons, or 6½ tons\r\nper square foot. This great area, 354 feet below the parapet of the\r\ntowers, is a surface consisting partly of bed-rock and partly of a\r\nmaterial so compact that it was found, to be almost impossible to drive\r\nan iron bar into it. Down below the mud, below all danger of scour,\r\nfar below the depth where the dreaded _teredo navalis_ can destroy the\r\ntimber in the caissons, these piers rest on an immovable foundation,\r\nand are an imperishable monument of man’s skill. The floor of the\r\nbridge is supported by four cables, each containing 6300 wires. Each\r\nwire is supposed to be subjected to a stress of about 570 pounds, and\r\nto have an ultimate strength of 3400 pounds. To say that each cable\r\nis pulled by a force of 3,591,000 pounds conveys but little real\r\nimpression to the mind—as little as to say that it would require a\r\npull of over 21,000,000 pounds to break it. And there are four such\r\ncables! The main span, including the weight of the cables, weighs about\r\n5000 tons. Some interesting facts concerning the caissons under the\r\npiers of this bridge will be given under the heading of “Caissons.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NIAGARA RAILWAY ARCH.]\r\n\r\nNIAGARA RAILWAY ARCH.—The railway suspension bridge, constructed by\r\nMr. John A. Roebling across the Niagara gorge in 1853–55, was justly\r\nconsidered a monument to the skill of a great engineer, a monument of\r\nthe world’s progress; and yet so rapid has been the advance in the art\r\nof bridge engineering, that this great structure is already a thing\r\nof the past, and has now been replaced by another bridge which better\r\nfulfills the increased requirements. It was not that Roebling’s bridge\r\nwas an engineering failure, but that the large increase in the weight\r\nand length of trains now requires a much stronger bridge. There were\r\nseveral formidable conditions confronting the engineer who designed the\r\nsteel arch which has now replaced the suspension bridge. For one thing,\r\na heavy railroad traffic was using the old bridge. The interruption\r\nof railroad traffic for even a few day’s is a serious matter. Extend\r\nthe time to several months, and the consequences are too serious for\r\ntoleration. And thus it became necessary to so plan and construct the\r\narch that both structures would occupy the same site, not interfere\r\nwith each other, and not interfere with the running of trains. It is\r\nan amazing, almost inconceivable, triumph of constructive skill that\r\nthis was accomplished so that “_not a single train was delayed_, and\r\ntraffic on the highway floor was suspended only for about two hours\r\neach day, while the upper floor system was being put in.” The second\r\nrigid requirement was the necessity for constructing the arch without\r\nany “false works” underneath. Of course it was not practicable to\r\nsuspend the various members of the arch during construction, from the\r\nold bridge, as it was not designed for such a load. Nor would it have\r\nbeen possible to plant false works in the deep and swift current of\r\nthe Niagara River. And so it became necessary to make each half of\r\nthe bridge self-supporting, as it hung out over the raging torrent a\r\ndistance of about 275 feet from the abutments, until the two projecting\r\narms could be joined in the centre. The illustration does not show the\r\nindependence of the arch from the old bridge. If the old bridge had\r\nnot been there (as was virtually the case, so far as support given by\r\nit is concerned), the independence of those arms reaching out over\r\nthe river would have been more apparent. Add to all these rigorous\r\nconditions the marvelous fact that the erection of this great arch was\r\nbegun on September 17, 1896, and that the bridge was tested on July 29,\r\n1897 (only 315 days afterward), and we have here one of the greatest\r\ntriumphs of engineering which could be imagined.\r\n\r\nPECOS RIVER VIADUCT.—The original location of the Galveston,\r\nHarrisburg, and San Antonio Railway included a section of about 25\r\nmiles which was very difficult to operate, on account of its very heavy\r\ngrades and sharp curvature. After some years of study and surveying,\r\na line was found which would save 11.2 miles in distance, 378 feet\r\nof rise and fall, and 1933 degrees of curvature, besides being free\r\nfrom land slides which threatened the old line at many points. But the\r\ngreat economic advantages in the expenses of operating could only be\r\nobtained at the cost of an almost unprecedented structure,—a viaduct\r\n2180 feet long, which should cross the Pecos River at an elevation of\r\n320 feet 10½ inches above the water surface. There are two bridges in\r\nEurope which span very deep gorges by _arches_, which are higher above\r\nthe water than this viaduct, but in such cases the depth of gorge is of\r\nno engineering importance. There is also a viaduct, for a narrow-gauge\r\nrailway in Bolivia, 800 feet long and with a height of 336 feet from\r\nthe rails to the water. But the Pecos viaduct is built to carry\r\nstandard-gauge railway traffic over a valley nearly half a mile wide,\r\nand at such a height that a train moving over it appears diminutive.\r\nThe stone towers in the illustration appear small, but they are\r\nconstructed to a height of over 50 feet above the ordinary level of the\r\nwater, to allow for possible floods. The longest “bents” have a height\r\nof 241 feet 0¾ inches. No “false works” were used in erecting the\r\nbridge. The “traveler,” shown in the illustration, had an arm 124 feet\r\n6 inches long. After completing the construction on one side of the\r\nriver (including one half of the “suspended” span immediately over the\r\nriver), the traveler was taken apart, loaded on cars and transported by\r\nrail a distance of nearly 40 miles, in order to reach the other side\r\nof the valley. Then the construction was carried on as before, until\r\nthe two halves of the suspended span met in the centre. The work of\r\nerection began November 3, 1891, and on February 20, 1892 (only 108\r\ndays later), the two halves of the suspended span were connected. A\r\nportion even of this time was lost by inclement weather and unavoidable\r\ndelays. This light “spider-web” method of construction for crossing\r\nvery high valleys was originated by American engineers, the first\r\nnotable instance of it being the construction of the “Kinzua” viaduct,\r\non the N. Y. L. E. & W. R. R., which has a length of 2050 feet and a\r\nheight of 302 feet above the water—figures which are only slightly\r\nless than the above.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FIRTH OF FORTH BRIDGE. GENERAL VIEW.]\r\n\r\nFORTH BRIDGE.—The next type of bridge to be considered has for its\r\nexample the largest bridge in the world—the “cantilever” crossing the\r\nFirth of Forth, in Scotland. The economic design of bridges of this\r\ntype, on the basis of the mechanical principles involved, is not only\r\nan achievement of this century, but of the latter part of the century.\r\nNevertheless, we may find illustrations of the fundamental principle\r\nin the stone lintels in an Egyptian temple; in a rough wooden bridge\r\nerected by Indians in Canada, near the line of the Canadian Pacific\r\nRailroad; and in a bridge erected over two hundred years ago in\r\nThibet, and discovered in 1783 by Lieutenant Davis, of the English\r\nembassy to the court of the Teshoo Lama. The principle of these bridges\r\nis very graphically shown by a photograph made at the time of the\r\nconstruction of the Forth bridge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PECOS RIVER VIADUCT.]\r\n\r\nThis bridge joins two sections of Scotland which had been previously\r\nseparated by an arm of the sea, which could only be crossed by a\r\ntedious ferry. Even this ferry was frequently tied up by fog or by\r\nthe strong gales which so often blow up the channel. The prevalence\r\nof heavy wind pressure demanded that special attention should be\r\ngiven to this feature, and the most elaborate tests ever made of the\r\neffect of wind on a bridge structure formed a part of the preliminary\r\nwork. The estuary, for a distance of nearly fifty miles, is never\r\nless than two miles wide, except at this one place, where it is but\r\nlittle more than one mile wide, with the added advantage of having the\r\nisland of Inchgarvie nearly in the centre of the channel. The channel\r\non both sides is about two hundred feet deep, which would forbid the\r\nlocation of a pier at any place except on this island, which, being\r\ncomposed of basaltic trap rock, furnished a sufficient foundation at\r\na comparatively slight depth below the surface. To secure the maximum\r\nrigidity consistent with economy in weight, the “vertical columns”\r\nof the towers were spaced 120 feet apart at the base, but only 33\r\nfeet apart at the top. The towers are 330 feet high. As shown in\r\nthe illustration, the cross-sectional dimensions of the cantilevers\r\ndiminish rapidly both in width and height, so that although the weight\r\nof the steel per running foot at the towers is 23 tons, it becomes\r\nonly a little over two tons per foot at the centre. The structure is\r\nexceptionally rigid.\r\n\r\nThe picture of any gigantic structure, especially when well\r\nproportioned, utterly fails to give an adequate idea of the size of its\r\ncomponent parts. It is difficult to realize from the illustration that\r\nthe four tubular “vertical columns” on each main pier are twelve feet\r\neach in diameter at the base—large enough for “a coach and four” to\r\ndrive into, if they were laid horizontally. Over 50,000 tons of steel\r\nwere used in the main spans. The total cost of the whole structure was\r\nover £3,200,000 ($16,000,000).\r\n\r\nSTONE ARCHES.—The nineteenth century has but little to claim as\r\nto the development of stone arches. The mechanical theory of their\r\nstresses is perhaps better understood now than ever, and the largest\r\nmasonry arch in existence (the Cabin John arch, having a span of 220\r\nfeet, carrying the Washington aqueduct over a creek) is a piece of\r\nAmerican work of this century. But it should not be forgotten that\r\nmore than five hundred years ago there was constructed at Trezzo,\r\nItaly, a granite arch of 251 feet span. This arch was unfortunately\r\ndestroyed in 1427. One of the most remarkable arches in existence was\r\ndesigned and built by an “uneducated” stone-mason at Pont-y-Prydd,\r\nWales, in 1750. A rigorous analysis of its strains—of which the\r\ndesigner probably knew nothing—shows that the “line of resistance”\r\npasses almost exactly through the centre of the arch ring. The most\r\nhighly educated engineer of the present day could do no better. On\r\nthe other hand, the development of the theory has been shown by the\r\nsuccessful construction of an exceedingly bold design for a bridge on\r\nthe Bourbonnais Railway, in France. The span is 124 feet, and the rise\r\nonly 6.92 feet. The design was considered so very bold that a model of\r\nthe arch was first constructed and tested before the design was finally\r\nadopted. The extension of the use of stone arches, especially those\r\nof very large size, is doubtless prevented by their excessive initial\r\ncost over the cost of a steel structure of equal span and strength.\r\nSince a stone arch is generally considered more beautiful than a steel\r\nbridge, the æsthetical element often demands the construction of stone\r\narches in public parks in situations where a metal structure would be\r\nmore economical. The great reduction in the cost of steel during the\r\npast few years, due to improved processes of manufacture, generally\r\nrenders the cost of a steel bridge, even with a proper allowance for\r\nmaintenance, repairs, and renewals, cheaper than a stone arch, unless\r\nthe span is short.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. CAISSONS.\r\n\r\nThe use of compressed air to keep back the water that would naturally\r\nflow through the soil into a deep excavation is a comparatively recent\r\nidea. In 1839 M. Triger, a French engineer, conceived the idea of\r\nsinking an iron cylinder through twenty metres of quicksand in the\r\nvalley of the Loire River, in order to reach a valuable coal deposit\r\nwhich was known to be located beneath the river. A chamber with doors,\r\nsuch as is now called an air-lock, was constructed at the top of the\r\ncylinder. To pass into the cylinder the lower door, opening downward,\r\nwas closed, and when the air in the chamber was at atmospheric\r\npressure, the upper door, also opening downward, was opened. Upon\r\nentering the chamber the upper door was shut, and air was pumped in\r\nuntil the pressure equaled the pressure in the cylinder underneath,\r\nwhich was also the pressure necessary to keep back the water from\r\nthe excavation. The lower door could then be opened and the working\r\nchamber entered. To pass out, the reverse process in inverse order was\r\nnecessary. This was the first pneumatic caisson ever sunk, although\r\nsuch plans had been proposed and even patented in England several years\r\nbefore. The idea was essentially the present plan, but the process has\r\nbeen improved and enlarged. The required pressure is substantially that\r\ndue to the weight of a column of water as high as the depth of the base\r\nof the caisson below the water surface. In the case of the St. Louis\r\nbridge, the bottom of the caisson was sunk to 109 feet 8½ inches below\r\nthe water surface, which required an air pressure of about 47 pounds\r\nper square inch in the working chamber. Such a pressure is dangerous to\r\nthose working in it. The men literally “live fast.” Great exertion is\r\neasily made, but is followed by corresponding exhaustion after leaving\r\nthe caisson. Those having heart disease, or who have been debilitated\r\nby previous excesses, are liable to be seriously affected—generally\r\nby a form of paralysis which has been specifically named by physicians\r\nthe “caisson disease.” At the St. Louis bridge, when working at the\r\ngreatest depths, the men were only worked four hours per day, in\r\ntwo-hour shifts. Facilities were likewise provided to have them bathe,\r\nrest, and take hot coffee on coming out of the working chamber. Healthy\r\nmen, who observed these and similar precautions, were not permanently\r\naffected by the work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FORMAL OPENING OF SUEZ CANAL.\r\n\r\nProcession of Ships in Canal, November 16, 1869.]\r\n\r\nThe caissons of the New York and Brooklyn suspension bridge are the\r\nlargest ever constructed, and a bald account of some of the experiences\r\nencountered is fairly dramatic. Under such air pressures the flame\r\nof a candle will return when blown out, and so the danger of fire\r\ninside the wooden caissons became very serious. One evening a fire\r\nwas discovered in one of the caissons, caused presumably by a workman\r\nholding a candle temporarily against the wooden roof while searching\r\nfor his dinner pail. When discovered it was apparent that the fire\r\nhad burned out a cavity in the solid timber roof, and the supply of\r\ncompressed air was fast turning those timbers into a mass of living\r\ncoal. Two pipes capable of throwing one and one half inch streams had\r\nbeen provided for this express contingency, and the two streams were\r\nturned on as quickly as possible. All night the fight went on. At 4\r\nA. M., when the water was pouring out of the orifice of the cavity as\r\nfast as it was sent in by the hose, it seemed as if the cavity must\r\nhave been thoroughly flooded and the fire out. To make sure of the\r\nabsolute extinction of the fire, borings were made, which showed that\r\nthe fire had worked its way along individual timbers, especially those\r\nwhich were “fat” with resin, and that the fourth roof course was still\r\na mass of burning timber. It was then decided that the caisson must be\r\nflooded, which was done by pumping in 1,350,000 gallons of water. After\r\nflooding the caisson for two and one half days, it was pumped out and\r\nthe work examined. It required the services of eighteen carpenters,\r\nworking day and night for two months, to repair the damage caused by\r\nthat fire.\r\n\r\nWhen the Brooklyn caisson was twenty-five feet below the water\r\nlevel, the boulders encountered became so large that blasting became\r\nnecessary. But blasting inside of a caisson was hitherto an untried\r\nexperiment. It was feared that the men would be injured; that their\r\near-drums would break by a sudden explosion in that confined space\r\nunder heavy air pressure; that a “blow out” might occur, i. e., that\r\nthe compressed air might suddenly escape past the edges, and that an\r\ninflow of water would then drown the men. At first a pistol was fired,\r\ngradually using heavier charges; then a small blast was set off.\r\nEncouraged by their freedom from resulting complications, the blasts\r\nwere gradually increased, until they finally used as heavy blasts as\r\nwas desired, the men simply stepping into an adjoining chamber to avoid\r\nflying fragments; and an increase in the rate of progress was at once\r\napparent, the caisson being lowered from twelve to eighteen inches,\r\nrather than only six inches, per week.\r\n\r\nThe caissons of the bridge across the Firth of Forth, Scotland, are\r\nexamples of the great development of the caisson idea. The pneumatic\r\ncaisson of Triger, in 1839, had but one air lock, through which must\r\npass men, excavated material, and constructive material for linings,\r\netc. This plan meant slow and expensive work. The caissons of the\r\nBrooklyn bridge were a vast improvement over this plan, both on the\r\nscore of economy and safety. In the Forth bridge the caissons were\r\nmade almost wholly of iron, thus avoiding the danger of the fire which\r\nso nearly wrecked the caisson of the Brooklyn bridge. The careless or\r\npremature opening of the doors of air locks, which once nearly caused a\r\nserious accident on the Brooklyn caisson, was rendered impossible by a\r\nvery elaborate system of interlocking. The efficiency of the apparatus\r\nfor removing excavated material from the compressed air chamber was\r\nalso greatly increased. Electric lights were used instead of gas or\r\ncandles.\r\n\r\n“FREEZING PROCESS.”—This process is mentioned here on account of the\r\nanalogy of its object to that of pneumatic caissons—sinking a shaft\r\nthrough excessively soft wet soil. The process is very recent, it\r\nhaving been invented by Dr. F. H. Poetsch, of Prussia, in 1883. It has\r\nbeen used only in a very few cases up to the present time, but where\r\nit has been used it has accomplished results which were practically\r\nunattainable by ordinary methods. A very brief description of one\r\ninstance of its use will explain the general idea. For many years\r\nengineers had been baffled in their attempts to sink a shaft through\r\n107 feet of quicksand at the Centrum mine, near Berlin, Germany. Dr.\r\nPoetsch sunk sixteen pipes in a circle around the proposed location\r\nof the shaft, and in thirty-three days had succeeded in producing a\r\nfrozen circular wall six feet thick, within which the excavation was\r\nreadily made and the shaft suitably lined. The freezing is accomplished\r\nby circulating a freezing liquid (chloride of calcium) through the\r\ntubes. After the shaft is completed the pipes can be thawed loose from\r\nthe wall of ice by simply circulating a hot liquid instead of a cold\r\none. The pipes can then be redrawn uninjured, and used over again—a\r\nconsideration of no small advantage. The process is not cheap. It would\r\nseldom, if ever, be used where the more common methods are practicable;\r\nbut for passing through very soft and wet soils it is frequently the\r\nonly possible method.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MANCHESTER SHIP CANAL.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. CANALS.\r\n\r\nHistory records the construction of a ship canal across the Suez\r\nIsthmus as early as 600 B. C.; that it continued in use for about 1400\r\nyears and was then abandoned. It was very small; all traces of it are\r\nnow utterly lost. The authentic records of it are very meagre, and\r\nthey serve only to show the great antiquity of the canal idea. The\r\nnineteenth-century progress on this line, therefore, consists in the\r\nenormously greater magnitude of the works accomplished in the solution\r\nof the great subsidiary problems involved, and in the improvement in\r\nmethods of work which has rendered these great structures possible. The\r\nlimitations of this article utterly forbid even a brief description of\r\nall the great canals which have been constructed during this century,\r\nand it must therefore be confined to a few statements regarding the\r\nmore important and typical constructions. It might be thought that\r\nno discussion of nineteenth-century canals would be complete without\r\na mention of the Nicaragua and Panama canal projects. But these\r\nstupendous works, which will eclipse anything of the kind which the\r\nworld has ever seen, are not yet accomplished facts. The twentieth\r\ncentury will be well under way before a trip “around the Horn” will\r\nbecome unnecessary. The successful completion of one of these canals\r\nwill, very probably, so reduce the demand for the other that its\r\nconstruction will be indefinitely postponed. These canals will not be\r\nfurther considered.\r\n\r\nSUEZ CANAL.—This great work permits a reduction of about 3750 miles in\r\nthe length of a voyage from Western Europe to India. Compared with some\r\nof the other great canals of the world, its construction was easy. The\r\ntotal length between termini is about 101 statute miles, of which about\r\nnine miles required no excavation; sixteen miles more required only\r\na slight excavation to make the channel of sufficient depth through\r\nexisting dry depressions, called “lakes;” and the remaining seventy-six\r\nmiles of excavation were cut chiefly through a soft alluvial soil. At\r\nonly one point did the excavation reach fifty or sixty feet in depth,\r\nand here also was found the only instance of rock excavation. Even\r\nthis rock (gypsum) was so soft that part of it was excavated by the\r\nsteam shovels. About 80,000,000 cubic yards of material were removed.\r\nIf this material had been loaded on to cars carrying twenty-five cubic\r\nyards per car, made up into trains of twenty cars per train, and\r\nthe trains were strung along at the rate of five per mile, it would\r\nhave required 32,000 miles of such trains to transport the material\r\nthat was excavated. Work was actually begun in 1800. The Viceroy of\r\nEgypt originally agreed to furnish the laborers required, and at\r\none time about 30,000 laborers were thus employed. On a change of\r\nadministration in Egypt, the new Viceroy refused to furnish the native\r\nlabor, and it then became necessary to import labor from Europe, and to\r\nsupplement this insufficient and high-priced supply of labor by very\r\nlarge dredging machines, or steam shovels, of which about sixty were\r\nemployed. The task of supplying water for the vast army of workmen\r\nwas an engineering feat of no mean character and cost, as the entire\r\nroute lies through an arid desert. A system of waterworks, having its\r\nsource at Cairo, on the Nile, and distributing the water throughout\r\nthe length of the canal, was therefore constructed. In the latter part\r\nof 1869, the waters of the Red and Mediterranean seas were joined,\r\nlarge arid depressions had been transformed into great lakes, and\r\nocean-going vessels were sailing through what had been a desert. The\r\ncanal is 26 feet deep, 72 feet wide at the bottom, the sides sloping\r\nvariably, according to the nature of the material, the resulting width\r\nat the top varying from 190 to 328 feet. Although not deep enough for\r\nthe very largest vessels afloat, it will accommodate the great bulk\r\nof ocean travel, including war vessels. The total cost of this work,\r\nincluding the breakwaters, lighthouses, etc., at each terminus, was,\r\napproximately, £20,000,000, or $100,000,000.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMPLETE ROCK CUT. CHICAGO DRAINAGE CANAL.\r\n\r\n(Depth 35 feet.)]\r\n\r\nUnlike most canals, the Suez canal has no locks. The original plan\r\nof the Panama canal did not include locks, but the revised plan\r\nprovided for them, in order to save excessive cutting. The Nicaragua\r\ncanal scheme necessarily includes locks. The water for the Suez\r\ncanal comes directly from the seas which are connected. A canal with\r\nlocks necessarily requires an ample water supply from some river or\r\nfresh-water lake. If the Suez canal had been constructed at a higher\r\nlevel than the Mediterranean and Red seas, had been supplied with water\r\nfrom the Nile, and had, therefore, been constructed with suitable\r\nlocks at each end (as was actually recommended by some engineers), the\r\ncost of construction, as well as the perpetual expense of maintenance,\r\nwould have been greatly in excess of its actual cost. And so the fact\r\nthat it was possible to construct the canal without locks, and without\r\nproviding for a supply of water, was a great advantage that facilitated\r\nthe promotion of the enterprise.\r\n\r\nMANCHESTER CANAL.—This canal, having a total length of only\r\nthirty-five and one half miles, has transformed the city of Manchester,\r\nEngland, from an inland city to a seaport. Actual excavation was begun\r\nin November, 1887, and just six years afterwards the whole canal was\r\nfilled with water. It has a depth of 26 feet, and a width at the\r\nbottom of from 120 to 170 feet, thus giving a greater capacity than\r\nthe Suez canal or the proposed Panama canal. Some of the greatest\r\ndifficulties involved arose from the necessity of providing for the\r\nexisting canals and railroads with which that busy portion of England\r\nis so crowded. Perhaps the most interesting feat of engineering was\r\nthe drawbridge carrying the Duke of Bridgewater’s canal at Barton.\r\nThis small canal, having originally a depth of only four and one half\r\nfeet, here crosses the River Irwell. It was justly considered a great\r\nfeat of engineering when James Brindley constructed the canal, during\r\nthe eighteenth century, so that it crossed the river on a viaduct. A\r\nwaterway crossing a waterway on a viaduct was then a new idea. But\r\nthis old canal was constructed considerably above the desired level of\r\nthe Manchester canal, and yet, of course, not so high that a masted\r\nship might pass under it. Therefore a draw became necessary. To add to\r\nthe complication, the water supply of the small canal being somewhat\r\nlimited, it was considered very undesirable to lose a troughful of\r\nwater (roughly, 200,000 gallons) each time the draw was opened. To\r\nallow this water to flow into a tank and then pump it back would\r\nconsume too much time, to say nothing of the expense. Therefore the\r\nbridge must swing with the trough full of water. That required gates\r\nat each end of the draw, as well as at the ends of the canal on each\r\nabutment. These gates were comparatively simple; but the difficult\r\nproblem was to ensure a water-tight joint between the ends of the draw\r\ntrough and the corresponding ends of the canal. Temperature changes, as\r\nwell as many other considerations, would preclude the possibility of\r\nmaking even a fairly tight joint by swinging the draw to a close fit\r\nwith the abutments. The desired result was accomplished by placing at\r\neach end of the draw a very short U-shaped structure, having the same\r\ncross section as the cross section of the trough, and having beveled\r\nends fitting corresponding bevels on the ends of the trough. These\r\nbeveled ends are faced with rubber. To open the draw the gates are\r\nclosed, the water between the gates at each end (a comparatively small\r\namount) is drained off and wasted, the U-shaped wedges are raised,\r\nand the draw is then free to turn. The wedges are operated by hydraulic\r\nrams.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN “ATLAS” POWDER BLAST UNDER A TRAVELING CABLEWAY.\r\nCHICAGO DRAINAGE CANAL.]\r\n\r\nCHICAGO DRAINAGE CANAL.—It will probably be a surprise to many people\r\nto learn that this “drainage” canal has a greater cross section\r\nthroughout the “earth-work” sections than any ship canal in existence,\r\nand is only exceeded through the rock sections by the Manchester canal.\r\nThe city of Chicago obtains its water supply from Lake Michigan. The\r\n“intake” pipe was at first located comparatively near the shore. As the\r\npopulation of the city grew and the volume of its sewage increased,\r\nit was observed that the water supply was becoming contaminated. The\r\nChicago River, into which the sewage was emptied, became so foul that\r\nthe odor was intolerable. The very evident fact of this odor probably\r\nhad more to do with the promotion and accomplishment of the means of\r\nrelief adopted than the far less evident but very dangerous pollution\r\nof the water supply. An extension of the intake pipe to a point several\r\nmiles from shore by means of a tunnel (which was in itself a notable\r\nfeat of engineering) only deferred the time when the water supply would\r\nagain be fatally contaminated if the sewage continued to flow into\r\nthe lake. It was accordingly determined to dispose of the sewage by\r\ndischarging it into an artificial channel where it might become diluted\r\nwith water from Lake Michigan, and thence pass from the watershed of\r\nthe Great Lakes to the watershed of the Mississippi. The level of Lake\r\nMichigan is so high that there was no trouble about obtaining the\r\nrequisite grade, and the divide between the watersheds is so low that\r\nthe depth of the required cutting at the summit was not forbidding. But\r\nwhy have such a large canal? It was required that the sewage should\r\nbe diluted, so as not to become offensive to the inhabitants of the\r\nregion through which the canal must pass. The law under which the work\r\nwas authorized required that the flow should be 600,000 cubic feet per\r\nminute, and that the minimum width at the bottom of the channel must be\r\n160 feet. According to the well-known laws of hydraulics, it was seen\r\nthat a deep canal would have a greater capacity per unit of excavation\r\nthan a very wide shallow canal. This is especially true through the\r\nsections of deepest cut, since excavation _above_ the water line adds\r\nnothing whatever to the capacity for flow. The sections adopted called\r\nfor a depth of water of 22 feet. The side walls in rock are practically\r\nvertical, the width of channel being 160 feet at the bottom and 162\r\nfeet at the top. In earthwork the cross section is larger than in rock,\r\nthus reducing the velocity of flow and danger of scouring the banks.\r\nThe width of channel at the bottom is 202 feet, the width at the water\r\nsurface being 290 feet, and the side slopes 2 horizontal to 1 vertical.\r\n\r\nA very expensive feature of this great work was the necessity for\r\nconstructing a diversion channel for the Desplaines River throughout\r\nthat portion of the river valley occupied by the canal. Lack of space\r\nforbids a further discussion of this feature. The canal drains into the\r\nDesplaines River at a point where the slope of the river is so great\r\nthat there will never be danger that a strong west wind or an unusual\r\nlowering of the level of Lake Michigan can possibly cause the current\r\nto flow eastward.\r\n\r\nWork on the canal was commenced only after many years of discussion,\r\nplanning, legislation, litigation, and bitter opposition by the varied\r\ninterests which considered themselves more or less injured. But the\r\nwork was actually commenced in July, 1892. The estimated excavation\r\nwas approximately 40,000,000 cubic yards—about one half that of the\r\nSuez canal; but the length is only 29 miles, compared with 101 miles\r\nfor the Suez canal. The total cost was estimated at something over\r\n$27,000,000. On August 22, 1900, the Congressional River and Harbor\r\nCommittee approved the work as far as completed.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. GEODESY.\r\n\r\nIt may be that many, who have read of the incredulity of all Europe\r\nwhen the voyages of navigators during the fifteenth and sixteenth\r\ncenturies first demonstrated the sphericity of the earth, will be\r\nsurprised to learn that this knowledge had been acquired almost\r\ntwo thousand years before, and had since then been _forgotten_.\r\nTo Eratosthenes, a Grecian, belongs the honor of first making a\r\nmeasurement (about the year 230 B. C.) of the size of the earth, which,\r\nwhile very rude and inaccurate, used the same fundamental principle\r\nas is now employed by geodesists. But the appliances of those ancient\r\nGrecians and of the Arabians, who later carried on the work, were\r\nexceedingly crude. Even during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,\r\nwhen the French, English, and Dutch were working very hard on the\r\nproblem, and were gradually obtaining results which came closer and\r\ncloser to those now known to be correct, the appliances for measuring\r\nangles were so rough and inaccurate that it was only possible to assert\r\nthat the earth is spherical, with a diameter of about 7900 miles. The\r\nseventeenth century was nearly past when Picard first used spider lines\r\nto determine the “line of collimation,” or the true line of sight, in a\r\ntelescope. This marked a new era in methods of work, but the eighteenth\r\ncentury was about half gone when it was first authoritatively\r\nproven that the earth is not a sphere, but is more truly an “oblate\r\nspheroid,”—such a figure as would be obtained by flattening a sphere\r\nat the poles. Some idea of the accuracy of the work done, even at this\r\nstage, may be obtained by considering that the computed flattening is\r\nso slight that if we had a perfect reproduction of the earth, reduced\r\nto a diameter of 12 inches, the flattening would be less than 1/25 of\r\nan inch—almost imperceptible even to a trained eye. The very highest\r\nmountain would be considerably less than 1/100 of an inch in height on\r\nsuch a sphere.\r\n\r\nThe present marvelous state of the science is due to the great\r\nimprovements which have been made in the construction and use of\r\nangle-measuring instruments and of “base bars;” also to the development\r\nof the mathematical theory and processes involved, notably that of\r\nthe “method of least squares.” As an illustration of the accuracy\r\nattainable in the construction of theodolites, the writer recently\r\nmade an elaborate test of the error of the centering of one of these\r\nangle-measuring instruments. Of course no _direct_ measurement is\r\npossible. The result is based on a long series of observations, which,\r\nwhen combined according to certain mathematical principles, will give\r\nthe desired result. The error was thus computed to be _forty-two\r\nmillionths_ of an inch. To realize what is meant when an angle is\r\nmeasured with a “probable error” of a few hundredths of a second of\r\narc, it should be remembered that one second of arc on a circle 10\r\ninches in diameter is less than 1/40000 of an inch. The accuracy which\r\nhas been attained in the measurement of base lines is not easily\r\nrealized by a layman. An engineer realizes the practical impossibility\r\nof measuring a line twice and obtaining _precisely_ the same result\r\nto the finest unit of measurement. The initiated are therefore able\r\nto appreciate the achievement of measuring a base line having a\r\nlength of over nine miles, with a “probable error” of less than one\r\nfive-millionth of its length. The words “probable error,” as used\r\nabove, have a scientifically exact meaning, but they may be taken by\r\nthe uninitiated as representing a measure of the precision obtained.\r\n\r\nAt about the close of the last century the great mathematician,\r\nLaplace, had declared that the results of the surveys which had then\r\nbeen made were inconsistent with the theory that the form of the earth\r\nis exactly that of an oblate spheroid. That form would require that\r\nthe equator and all parallels of latitude shall be true circles, and\r\nthat all meridian sections shall be equal ellipses. Laplace showed that\r\nthe discrepancies between the actual results obtained and the results\r\nwhich the theory would call for are too great to be considered as mere\r\ninaccuracies in the work done. With the extension, during this century,\r\nof the great geodetic surveys, carried on by the various governments\r\nof the world, more and more evidence has developed that the meridian\r\nsections of the earth are not equal, which is equivalent to saying that\r\nthe equator is not a perfect circle. This has led to the next stage,\r\nwhich has been to prove that the form of the earth may be more closely\r\nrepresented by an “ellipsoid” than by a spheroid, that is, that _every_\r\nsection of the earth is an ellipse. Several calculations have been made\r\nto determine the length and location of the principal axes of such a\r\nfigure. But these calculations are considered unsatisfactory, because\r\nevidence has developed that the true form of the earth cannot be\r\nrepresented even by an ellipsoid. This figure is symmetrical above and\r\nbelow the equator. There are reasons for believing that the southern\r\nhemisphere of the earth is slightly larger than the northern, and that\r\nthe form of the earth is more nearly that of an “ovaloid,”—a figure of\r\nwhich the ordinary hen’s egg is an exaggerated example.\r\n\r\nAll the above forms, the sphere, spheroid, ellipsoid, and ovaloid\r\nare geometrical forms which represent with more and more exactness\r\nthe true form of the earth, but even this increasing exactness will\r\nnot account for the discrepancies and irregularities which have been\r\nfound at various places, and which cannot be explained on the ground\r\nof inaccurate work. Geodesists have been forced to the conclusion that\r\nthe true form of the earth is not a regular geometrical form, but is\r\na “geoid,” that is, like the earth and like nothing else, unless we\r\nadmit the exaggerated comparison that it is “like a potato.” It should\r\nbe understood that the words “form of the earth” do not refer to the\r\nactual surface of mountain, valley, or ocean bottom, but to the actual\r\nocean surface, and to the surface which the free ocean would assume if\r\nit could penetrate into the heart of the continents. The astounding\r\naccuracy of the work done may be appreciated when we consider that the\r\ndifferences between the “geoid” and the more accurate mathematical\r\nforms are distances which should be measured in feet rather than in\r\nmiles. For many purposes, it is sufficiently exact to consider the\r\nearth as a sphere. For some very precise work it is necessary to\r\nconsider it as a spheroid. The more exact forms have little or no\r\nutilitarian value, and the vast amount of work that has been spent\r\non these researches has been due to man’s thirst for knowledge as\r\nsuch,—due to the same enthusiasm which advances the sciences in fields\r\nwhich only broaden man’s knowledge of the world in which we live.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. RAILROADS.\r\n\r\nThe achievements of engineering skill on the line of bridges, canals,\r\ntunnels, etc., have been great, but their effect is insignificant\r\ncompared with the social revolution that was created by the invention\r\nand development of railroads. The railroads of this country represent\r\na value of about $12,000,000,000—one sixth of the national wealth.\r\nTheir pay-rolls include about 850,000 employees—1/28 of the working\r\npopulation. They support, directly or indirectly, about 5,000,000\r\npeople. They collect an annual revenue of about $1,200,000,000, which\r\nis greater than the value of the combined products of gold, silver,\r\niron, coal, and other minerals, wheat, rye, oats, barley, potatoes,\r\nand tobacco, produced by the entire nation. Such a stupendous social\r\ninstitution requires special discussion, and it will be found treated\r\nseparately under the heading of “Evolution of the Railway.”\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. TUNNELS.\r\n\r\nTunnels are of exceedingly ancient origin, if by tunnels we include\r\nall artificial underground excavations. From prehistoric times natural\r\ncaves have been used as burial places, and, following this practice,\r\ntunnels and artificial rock chambers have been cut out by kings and\r\nrulers in Thebes, Nubia, and India during periods so ancient that we\r\ncall the study of their history archæology. Nor were the ancient\r\ntunnels confined to tombs. The Babylonians constructed tunnels through\r\nmaterial so soft that a lining of brick masonry had to be used to\r\nsustain the work. The Romans constructed a tunnel over three and one\r\nhalf miles long to drain the waters of Lake Fucino. About 30,000\r\nlaborers were occupied on this work for eleven years. The nineteenth\r\ncentury can hardly boast of works that represent a greater amount\r\nof labor (measured in mere days of work) than some of these ancient\r\nmonuments of constructive skill, but the masterpieces of this century\r\nare works which have been greatly aided and even rendered possible by\r\nthree modern inventions,—compressed-air drilling machines, modern\r\nexplosives, and the compressed-air process used in subaqueous work.\r\nThe advance in methods of tunnel surveying is as great and nearly\r\nas important. Progress in excavating tunnels is necessarily slow,\r\nbecause the working face is so small that only a few men can work\r\nthere at a time, and the rate of advance depends upon them. As an\r\nillustration: although the Mont Cenis tunnel belongs to the latter\r\nhalf of this century, the first blast being made in 1857, yet for\r\nthe first four years hand drilling was employed, when the average\r\nprogress was about nine inches per day. Then machine drilling with\r\ncompressed air was adopted, when the rate of advance was multiplied\r\nfive times. The invention of compressed-air drills simultaneously\r\nsolved two difficulties: (1) The compressed air furnishes an extremely\r\nconvenient and safe form of power, which enables holes to be drilled\r\nmuch more rapidly than it is possible to drill them by hand. (2) The\r\ncompressed air, after doing its work, is exhausted into the tunnel,\r\nand thus furnishes a continuous supply of fresh air. The necessity\r\nfor ventilation has often required the construction and operation of\r\nexpensive ventilating plants. Add to these improvements the lighting of\r\nthe tunnel, even during construction, by electric lights which consume\r\nno oxygen, and the comparison between ancient and modern methods\r\nbecomes especially marked. Before the invention of explosives, hard\r\nrock was sometimes broken by building wood fires next to the rock,\r\nand then, when the rock had become very hot, cooling it suddenly with\r\nwater. The sudden contraction would split the rock. Ventilation was\r\nattempted by waving fans at the tunnel entrances. With torches and\r\nfires to consume the precious oxygen, and no effective ventilation, it\r\nis a wonder how those earlier tunnels were constructed. The compressed\r\nair methods for subaqueous work will be referred to under a special\r\ncase. The essential principles have already been described under\r\ncaissons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AMERICAN PORTAL, ST. CLAIR TUNNEL. NORTH OF DETROIT,\r\nMICH.]\r\n\r\nTUNNEL SURVEYING.—The tunnel surveying developed during this century\r\nis one of the marvels of surveying work. If a tunnel is to be several\r\nmiles in length, not only is the excavation commenced at each end, but\r\none or more intermediate shafts are frequently sunk to the level of the\r\ntunnel, and excavation is extended in each direction from the shafts.\r\nIt is extremely important that these sections of the tunnel should\r\n“meet” exactly. If they should fail to do so by any appreciable amount,\r\nthe necessary modifications are frequently costly and therefore justify\r\nthe most elaborate precautions in the surveying work, especially since\r\nthe surveying costs much less than the consequences of such a blunder.\r\nThe Hoosac tunnel is over 25,000 feet long. The heading from the east\r\nend met the heading from the central shaft at a point 11,274 feet from\r\nthe east end and 1563 feet from the shaft. The error in alignment was\r\nfive sixteenths of an inch, that of levels “a few hundredths,” error\r\nof distance “trifling.” The corrected alignment was then carried on\r\ntoward the heading from the west end, which it met at a point 10,138\r\nfeet (nearly two miles) from the west end and 2056 feet from the shaft.\r\nHere the error of alignment was 9/16 of an inch and that of levels\r\nabout 1-5/8 inches. The surveying work of the spiral tunnels on the\r\nSt. Gothard Railway (to be described later) is another example of\r\nmarvelously accurate work under peculiarly unfavorable circumstances.\r\n\r\nST. GOTHARD TUNNEL.—To appreciate the magnitude of the problem\r\ninvolved, of which this great tunnel is the crowning feature, some idea\r\nshould be obtained of the Alpine topography lying between Silenen, in\r\nSwitzerland, and Bodio, in Italy, less than forty miles apart. The\r\nidea of connecting Switzerland and Italy by a railroad passing over or\r\nthrough the Alps, by utilizing the St. Gothard Pass as far as possible,\r\ndates back to 1850, or even earlier. An enterprise of such magnitude\r\ncould be consummated only after years of discussion, planning,\r\nsurveying, negotiations, and even international agreements. In 1871 a\r\ntreaty was finally ratified between Germany, Italy, and Switzerland, by\r\nwhich the construction and financiering was duly authorized. On August\r\n7, 1872, the contract for the construction was signed, with a proviso\r\nthat the work must be completed within eight years. On April 30, 1880,\r\nthe advance headings met, and soon thereafter the mails were regularly\r\ncarried through, although the tunnel was not actually completed in the\r\nspecified time.\r\n\r\nThe route adopted was bold enough to stagger the financier, if not the\r\nengineer. Starting from Silenen, Switzerland, it required a climb of\r\nnearly 2000 feet to reach Göschenen, the adopted northern portal of\r\nthe tunnel. This would require an _average_ grade of 200 feet per mile\r\nin the ten miles of distance, or an actual grade of 370 feet per mile\r\nin the upper part of the line, if the river valley were followed. The\r\nline was therefore “developed,” that is, the distance was purposely\r\nincreased by adopting an indirect line, in order that the grade\r\nmight be less. It was found possible to run the line from Silenen to\r\nPfaffensprung, a distance of about six miles, on the comparatively low\r\ngrade of 137 feet per mile. At this point the line suddenly plunges\r\ninto the mountain, and curves around in a circle, which is, roughly,\r\n2000 feet in diameter, while it continues an upward grade of 121½ feet\r\nper mile. After traversing 4845 feet of such tunnel, the line again\r\nemerges into the open air, having turned nearly three fourths of a\r\ncircle in the solid rock. About 2000 feet farther on the line actually\r\ncrosses itself, the upper line there being 167½ feet higher than the\r\nlower line, which is at that point within the tunnel. By this device,\r\nwhich is called a spiral, the line is run at a practicable grade, and\r\nan elevation of 167½ feet is surmounted by introducing 6986 feet of\r\n“development.” Near the entrance of the Leggistein tunnel, the line is\r\nless than 500 feet away (horizontally) from a lower part of the line,\r\nwhich is about 350 feet lower in elevation. Space forbids a further\r\ndescription of this climb of 2000 feet to Göschenen, where the line\r\nplunges into the bowels of the earth, and does not again emerge until\r\nit has traversed _nine and one quarter miles_, and has reached the\r\nsouthern slope of the Alps. Even here the portal is 3755 feet above\r\nsea level, and the valley down to Bodio is steeper in places than\r\nthe valley of the Reuss. Four spirals are used in descending about\r\n2650 feet in an air line distance of less than 19 miles. In one place\r\neven the upper line, where it crosses the lower line, is in solid\r\nrock. Imagine standing in the gloom of a tunnel and considering that\r\nvertically beneath your feet—more than 100 feet further down in the\r\nbowels of the earth—there is another tunnel belonging to the same line\r\nof road. The great majority of tunnels are straight. A few have curves\r\nat one or both ends, but nowhere else in the world can be found such\r\nexamples of spiral tunnels carved out of the living rock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR OF ST. CLAIR TUNNEL, NORTH OF DETROIT, MICH.]\r\n\r\nST. CLAIR TUNNEL.—A glance at a map of lower Canada and Michigan\r\nwill show that all the rail traffic of lower Canada, and even that\r\nfrom Montreal and Quebec, that passes as far west as Chicago, must\r\neither cross the Detroit River at Detroit or the St. Clair River, at\r\nor near Port Huron. Plans for bridging the river have been frequently\r\nmade, but the Canadian government has steadily refused permission.\r\nThe traffic along the river in 1896 amounted to over 35,000,000 tons,\r\nor more than was shipped at the ports of either New York, London, or\r\nLiverpool, and greatly in excess of that which passed through the\r\nSuez canal. Such traffic must not be impeded even by a drawbridge;\r\nand therefore a tunnel was the only alternative. The problem was in\r\nmany respects unique. Borings showed that the tunnel must pass through\r\nclay and occasional pockets of quicksand, and therefore it would be\r\nnecessary to employ a pneumatic method. Brunel had used a “shield” on\r\nthe Thames tunnel half a century before; but all of the earlier tunnels\r\nconstructed by this method were much smaller, and the difficulty and\r\ndanger increase very rapidly as the size increases.\r\n\r\nIn 1886 the “St. Clair Tunnel Company,” virtually a creature of\r\nthe Grand Trunk Railway Company, was organized, and in 1888 work\r\nwas begun. After a false start, made by sinking shafts which were\r\nafterwards abandoned, open cuttings were commenced at each end, which\r\nwere extended to points 6000 feet apart, between which the tunnel was\r\nexcavated and lined. The circular lining, having an outside diameter of\r\n21 feet, is of cast iron, made in segments which are bolted together,\r\nhaving strips of wood three sixteenths of an inch thick placed in the\r\njoints. Liquid asphalt was freely used as a preservative and to make\r\ntight joints. The tunnel was excavated for nearly 2000 feet on each\r\nside as an ordinary open tunnel until the excavation was actually\r\nunder the river; then a diaphragm with air locks was built on each\r\nside, and that part of the tunnel lying under the river—2290 feet in\r\nlength—was constructed under air pressure. Several curious facts were\r\ndeveloped during the construction. The material excavated outside of\r\nthe shields was thrown inside, loaded on to cars, and hauled by mules\r\nto the diaphragm. It was found that horses could not work in compressed\r\nair. Mules could do so, but even they were sometimes affected by “the\r\nbends,” a disease akin to paralysis, which frequently occurred among\r\nthe men. The shields were forced forward by twenty-four hydraulic rams,\r\neach having a capacity of 125 tons, or 3000 tons for each shield.\r\nUsually a force of 1200 to 1500 tons was sufficient. Much gas was\r\nencountered, which, on account of its explosiveness, prevented the\r\nemployment of blasting to break up the boulders which were frequently\r\nfound. The advantages of electric lighting in compressed air work were\r\nexemplified in this tunnel. In August, 1890, about one year after\r\nthe shields were placed on each side of the river, they met near the\r\ncentre. The progress of each shield averaged nearly ten feet per day.\r\nConsidering the frequency with which the cost of great engineering work\r\nexceeds the original estimate, it is remarkable to note that in this\r\ncase the actual cost ($2,700,000) was less than the original estimate,\r\nwhich was about $3,000,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CENTURY’S PROGRESS IN THE ANIMAL WORLD\r\n\r\nBY D. E. SALMON, M.D.,\r\n\r\n_Chief of Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S. Agricultural Department_.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. OF ANIMAL DISEASES.\r\n\r\nThe wars of Napoleon, which in the early years of the nineteenth\r\ncentury so seriously affected the governments and institutions of\r\nEurope, had an equally marked influence upon the development of the\r\nanimal industry in the countries that were brought within the sphere\r\nof the military operations. This chapter of the history of that period\r\nappears to have been neglected by writers who have industriously delved\r\ninto details of subjects of far less interest and importance. Enough\r\nhas been chronicled by various historians, however, to show that in\r\nmany cases those engaged in successful operations for improving the\r\nbreeds of domesticated animals were forced to abandon the work to which\r\nthey had devoted their lives, and for which long study and experience\r\nhad specially fitted them, and to become units in the vast armies which\r\nwere organized only to melt away in the bloody and disastrous campaigns\r\nof that epoch. But it was not the men alone that were taken. The best\r\nhorses were seized for the use of the officers and the cavalry, for\r\nthe artillery and the transportation trains. The sheep and swine were\r\nslaughtered for the subsistence of the armies, and the cattle were\r\ndriven off for the same purpose. Neither the choicest flocks and herds\r\nnor the most magnificent individuals produced by the breeder’s art\r\nescaped. The fruits of many years of patient effort in selection and in\r\nguiding the forces of heredity were blotted out; the animals left were\r\nfew and inferior. To crown all these disasters, the most deadly forms\r\nof contagion were gathered from their hiding places with the animals\r\nthat were seized, the plagues which these caused were propagated among\r\nthe vast aggregation of beasts that were required for the service\r\nof the armies, and, finally, they were disseminated throughout all\r\nsections to which these armies penetrated.\r\n\r\nThe agriculturists of Great Britain, thanks to the isolation due to\r\nthe considerable expanse of water which separates their territory from\r\nthe mainland, escaped not only the invasions of armed and destructive\r\nhosts, but also the pestilences which accompanied them. While,\r\ntherefore, the farmers of the continent were struggling to save a few\r\nof their remaining animals from the ravages of glanders, rinderpest,\r\nfoot-and-mouth disease, pleuro-pneumonia, and other plagues, those of\r\nthe British Isles were perfecting the work of their ancestors without\r\nmolestation. These circumstances, lost sight of by many, explain to\r\na certain extent the apparently marvelous success of the British\r\nhusbandmen in developing so many breeds of horses, cattle, sheep,\r\nand swine to the wonderful perfection which we see at the end of the\r\nnineteenth century. The favorable climate, together with the abundant\r\nand nutritious herbage, have undoubtedly been factors in the production\r\nof the British breeds, but the power and opportunity to select the best\r\nanimals and retain these for breeding purposes must also have had great\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nThe effect of contagious diseases in retarding the development of\r\nanimal life may be appreciated from the estimate, carefully made,\r\nthat in the closing years of the eighteenth century the cattle plague\r\n(rinderpest) alone destroyed in Europe two hundred million head of\r\ncattle, valued at seven billions of dollars. During the first half\r\nof the nineteenth century, cattle plague, pleuro-pneumonia, and\r\nfoot-and-mouth disease were particularly disastrous to the animal\r\nindustry of the Continent of Europe, and unquestionably, also,\r\nthroughout Asia, which appears to have been the original habitat of\r\nthese plagues. During the last third of this century the development\r\nof veterinary science, together with the enactment of sanitary\r\nlegislation and the enforcement of intelligent measures of repression,\r\nhave practically eradicated the cattle plague from the countries\r\nof Europe, and we have only to note, as important, its invasion of\r\nGreat Britain in 1865, which led to the adoption of the present most\r\nexcellent sanitary organization, and the extensive outbreak on the\r\ncontinent following the Franco-Prussian war. During the last six years\r\nthis plague has swept over large sections of the African continent,\r\ndestroying nearly every bovine animal in the regions first invaded, and\r\nhad it not been for the fortunate and timely discovery of a successful\r\nmethod of preventive inoculation, the cattle industry would have been\r\nabsolutely annihilated.\r\n\r\nPleuro-pneumonia, almost equally destructive with cattle plague and\r\nmuch more persistent, was widely disseminated over the continent of\r\nEurope during the seventeenth century, and reached England about\r\n1840. Many years were lost in futile contentions over the subject of\r\ncontagion, and it was not until the last twenty years that vigorous\r\nmeasures for its extermination were enforced. In the meantime the\r\ncontagion had been carried to Australia and South Africa, where it\r\nhas since remained domiciled, a constant source of loss to the cattle\r\ngrowers. The losses from this disease in Europe are now comparatively\r\nunimportant, but in the countries of Asia and Africa, and in Australia,\r\nit is still a great incubus. Foot-and-mouth disease, less fatal in\r\nits effects than the other maladies mentioned, appears to be more\r\ndifficult to control, and, in the closing years of the century, we find\r\nit prevailing extensively over the principal countries of Continental\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nThe diseases which have most seriously affected the development of\r\nother species of animals are the glanders of horses, the variola of\r\nsheep (sheep-pox), and the three diseases of swine known in Europe as\r\nerysipelas, swine pest, and swine plague. These have been extremely\r\nprevalent and fatal in many parts of Europe. Glanders, swine pest, and\r\nswine plague have been brought to the American continent, and have been\r\neven more destructive here than in their ancient habitat.\r\n\r\nThe diseases which at present are regarded as most serious attracted\r\nbut little attention at the beginning of the century, or were unknown.\r\nTuberculosis has now become the great scourge of dairy cows and other\r\nhighly bred cattle, ruining many of the best herds and threatening the\r\nhealth of the consumers of milk, if not also of beef. Texas fever, a\r\ndisease of cattle first studied in the United States, but now known to\r\nbe widely disseminated over the South American, African, and Australian\r\ncontinents, has during late years retarded operations for improving\r\nand increasing the stock of cattle, and has seriously restricted the\r\nmarketing of animals from the infected districts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THOROUGHBRED.]\r\n\r\nThis brief summary relative to contagious diseases and their effects\r\nis all the attention that can be given in this article to conditions\r\nwhich through all historic times have been important, and, in many\r\ncases, have been supreme in their influence upon the tendencies\r\nand development of the animal population. As the twentieth century\r\napproaches, however, the influence of the animal plagues is on the\r\nwane, and with a few more years of active scientific investigations\r\nthey will all be so thoroughly controlled that the disastrous\r\nvisitations of the past can never be repeated, and they will not even\r\nbe a hindrance or menace to the stock grower.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. INCREASE IN NUMBERS.\r\n\r\nAs might be expected, there has been an increase in the numbers of the\r\ndomesticated animals held in the various countries of the world, but\r\nthis increase has been far from uniform, and cannot be measured either\r\nby the growth of the population or the degree of prosperity. Evidently\r\nthe density of population, the development of manufactures, and the\r\nfertility of the soil have had much influence.\r\n\r\nIn the United Kingdom there were 1,500,000 horses in 1800, and but\r\n2,000,000 in 1898. During this time the cattle had increased from\r\n5,000,000 to 11,000,000; the sheep from 25,000,000 to 31,000,000; and\r\nthe swine from 3,000,000 to 3,700,000. Thus, while the cattle doubled\r\nin numbers during the century, the horses increased but one third, the\r\nsheep one fourth, and the swine one fourth. As in the same period the\r\npopulation of the country was augmented from 16,200,000 to 40,000,000,\r\nor two and one half times, it is not difficult to see why England has\r\nbecome the world’s greatest market for animals and animal products.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note the increase in animals in a few of the\r\nprincipal countries of Europe. In France there were 1,800,000 horses\r\nat the beginning of the century, and there were 3,418,000 in 1896. The\r\ncattle increased from 6,000,000 to 13,334,000; the swine from 4,500,000\r\nto 6,400,000; the goats from 800,000 to 1,500,000; while the sheep\r\ndecreased from 30,000,000 to 21,200,000. That is, in round numbers, the\r\nhorses, cattle, and goats doubled, the swine increased nearly 50 per\r\ncent, but the sheep were diminished one fourth. The population advanced\r\nfrom 27,350,000 to 38,500,000, or about 40 per cent.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, from 1828 to 1892, the horses increased from 2,500,000 to\r\n3,836,000; the cattle from 9,770,000 to 17,500,000; the goats from\r\n700,000 to 3,000,000; the swine from 4,500,000 to 12,174,000; and the\r\nsheep decreased from 17,300,000 to 13,600,000. The population increased\r\nduring the same time from 29,700,000 to 49,500,000.\r\n\r\nIn European Russia, from 1828 to 1888, the horses were increased from\r\n12,000,000 to 20,000,000; the cattle from 19,000,000 to 23,840,000; the\r\nsheep from 36,000,000 to 47,500,000; while the swine decreased from\r\n15,800,000 to 9,200,000. The population during this period increased\r\nfrom 45,000,000 to 90,000,000.\r\n\r\nThese are the countries in which there is most interest on account of\r\ntheir influence upon the markets of the world. In regard to Europe\r\nas a whole, owing to the lack of statistics, we can only estimate\r\napproximately as to the condition at the beginning of the century. From\r\nsuch data as are available it appears that there were about 20,600,000\r\nhorses, 61,800,000 cattle, 157,500,000 sheep, and 36,600,000 swine.\r\nThe population of Europe at that time is placed at 175,000,000. In\r\nthe year 1900 there will be in Europe not far from 44,250,000 horses,\r\n108,000,000 cattle, 180,575,000 sheep, and 56,800,000 swine. The\r\npopulation will reach about 380,000,000.\r\n\r\nFrom these figures it would appear that, taking all of Europe, the\r\nhuman population has increased more rapidly than have any of these\r\nspecies of domesticated animals. In other words, the population is 2.17\r\ntimes what it was at the beginning of the century, while there are but\r\n2.14 times as many horses, 1.75 times as many cattle, 1.55 times as\r\nmany swine, and 1.14 times as many sheep.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WATERING THE COWS.]\r\n\r\nThis growing deficiency in the stock of animals, coupled with an\r\nincreasing consumption of meat per capita, has led to the importation\r\nof great numbers of animals and large quantities of meats and other\r\nanimal products. The resulting trade has stimulated the production of\r\nanimals in other parts of the world, particularly in the United States\r\nof America, Australia, and Argentina, in all of which there has been a\r\nmarvelous development.\r\n\r\nThere are no reliable statistics as to the number of animals in the\r\nUnited States at the beginning of the century. Some have estimated that\r\nthere were only 300,000 horses, 600,000 cattle, and 600,000 sheep; but\r\nthe writer is of the opinion that there were from 500,000 to 1,000,000\r\nhorses, at least 3,000,000 head of cattle, and from 2,000,000 to\r\n3,000,000 sheep. In 1840, with a population of 17,063,000, there were\r\n4,300,000 horses, 14,900,000 cattle, 19,300,000 sheep, and 26,300,000\r\nswine; while in 1899 the number is placed at 15,800,000 horses and\r\nmules, 44,000,000 cattle, 39,000,000 sheep, and 38,600,000 swine.\r\n\r\nIn 1888 the horses of Canada numbered 1,100,000, the cattle 3,790,000,\r\nthe sheep 2,600,000, and the swine 1,205,000. In the same year Mexico\r\nwas credited with 2,000,000 horses, 3,000,000 cattle, 2,000,000 sheep,\r\nand 5,000,000 goats. Taking the whole of North America, and making\r\nallowances for the increase since 1888 in Canada and Mexico, it may\r\nbe fairly assumed that at the close of the century there will be about\r\n19,000,000 horses and mules, 55,000,000 cattle, 50,000,000 sheep, and\r\n40,000,000 swine.\r\n\r\nIn South America, Argentina far outstrips all other countries in animal\r\nproduction. The horses, which in 1864 numbered 3,875,000, had increased\r\nby 1895 to 4,447,000; the cattle increased in the same period from\r\n10,215,000 to 21,702,000; the sheep, from 23,110,000 to 74,380,000. The\r\npopulation in 1895 was only 3,964,000. In Uruguay there were, in 1895,\r\n402,348 horses, 5,248,000 cattle, and 14,333,000 sheep. In Paraguay\r\nthere were, in 1896, 246,000 horses and 2,100,000 cattle. The last\r\nreturns from Chili (1882?) give 450,000 horses, 1,530,000 cattle, and\r\n2,500,000 sheep. As to the condition in Brazil, we have no reliable\r\nstatistics.\r\n\r\nThe animal industries of Australasia have shown the most wonderful\r\ndevelopment during the century. In 1800, there were but 200 horses,\r\n1040 cattle, and 6100 sheep. In 1810, there were 1130 horses, 12,440\r\ncattle, 25,900 sheep, and 9540 swine. In 1896, there were 1,923,554\r\nhorses, 12,701,600 cattle, 110,524,000 sheep, and 1,000,000 swine.\r\n\r\nIn Asia there are large numbers of animals, but it is impossible to\r\ngive statistics, except for British India, where, in 1895, there were\r\n1,152,000 horses, 49,000,000 cattle, and 17,200,000 sheep.\r\n\r\nMr. Simonds endeavored to ascertain the number of each class of live\r\nstock in the world in 1890, and his conclusions may be accepted as\r\napproximately correct. He placed the total number of horses in all\r\ncountries at 63,469,000, the asses and mules at 10,318,000, the cattle\r\nat 309,807,000, the sheep at 588,935,000, the swine at 102,526,000, and\r\nthe goats at 59,971,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. IMPROVEMENT OF BREEDS OF ANIMALS.\r\n\r\nThe increased number of animals now held in various parts of the\r\nworld does not give an adequate idea of the enlarged production of\r\nanimal food products, as compared with one hundred years ago. During\r\nthe last century there has been constant improvement in the various\r\nbreeds of animals, with a view to perfect their form and shorten\r\nthe time required for their growth. The breeder has learned how to\r\nstimulate development, and has fixed the quality of early maturity,\r\nthrough hereditary influence, until it is now transmitted with the same\r\nregularity as are other characteristics.\r\n\r\nCattle are no longer fed until they are three or four years old before\r\nbeing sent to the butcher, and it has been found that they can be\r\nmade to yield an equal quantity of beef of better quality at eighteen\r\nmonths to two years. It is the flesh of such young animals which has\r\nbeen much discussed under the title of “baby beef.” Not only is this\r\nbeef commended on account of its tenderness, its high nutritive value,\r\nand the more even distribution of fat through the muscular tissue, but\r\nbecause this shortening of the feeding period enables the farmer to\r\nproduce a greatly increased quantity of human food from the same number\r\nof acres. That is, by reducing the age at which bullocks are marketed\r\nfrom three and one half years, as was formerly the rule, to twenty\r\nmonths, it is possible for the same farm to produce one third more\r\nanimals in a given series of years.\r\n\r\nIt may be admitted that not all of the stock of beef-producing animals,\r\nnor even the greater part of it, has acquired this extreme degree\r\nof early maturity, but most of it has developed somewhat in this\r\ndirection. The large-boned, gaunt, and long-horned cattle of Texas have\r\nnearly disappeared, and even in Mexico they are being rapidly replaced\r\nby others of better quality. The most important fact is that breeds\r\nexist which can be depended upon for the speedy transformation of the\r\nentire stock of cattle when the necessity arises.\r\n\r\nA similar hastening of maturing has been accomplished with the\r\nmutton breeds of sheep, with numerous varieties of swine, and to a\r\nconsiderable extent with poultry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A TEMPERANCE SOCIETY. (HERRING.)]\r\n\r\nThe development of the dairy breeds of cattle has also been remarkable.\r\nIt can be best appreciated by contrasting the half wild cows of our\r\nWestern plains, which yield but two or three quarts of milk a day at\r\ntheir best, and none for half of the year, with the highly specialized\r\ntypes which produce twenty to thirty quarts daily when in full flow,\r\nand with which the milk secretion continues from year to year without\r\ninterruption.\r\n\r\nThe yield of butter has been increased equally with that of milk,\r\nand among the dairy breeds there are some which are specially valued\r\nbecause of their aptitude for butter production. While the unimproved\r\ncow yields but one fourth to one half pound of butter a day, good\r\nspecimens of the best breeds produce from one and one half to three\r\npounds, and in numerous instances still greater quantities.\r\n\r\nIn the production of wool there has also been a wonderful advance. The\r\nfibre has been increased in length, the fleece has been distributed\r\nmore uniformly over the surface of the body, and the quality of\r\nthe fibre has been modified to conform to the requirements for\r\nmanufacturing the infinite varieties of fabrics demanded by modern\r\ncivilization. The fleece of to-day is probably three times as heavy as\r\nthat of a century ago.\r\n\r\nThe improvement in the Merino type has been truly wonderful. Not only\r\nhave the beautiful long and silky wools of the Rambouillet and Saxony\r\nbreeds been developed by persistent selection, but the body of the\r\nMerino, formerly small and almost useless for its flesh, has been\r\nbrought to a standard closely approaching that of the best mutton\r\nbreeds.\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that the changes of fashion have, during the latter\r\npart of the century, made the production of the extra fine wools less\r\nprofitable than the coarse varieties, and that, as a consequence, many\r\nflocks which had been bred to the very highest degree of perfection in\r\nthis direction have gone to the shambles, and their peculiar points of\r\nexcellence have been lost.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ART CRITICS. (GEBLER.)]\r\n\r\nWith poultry, a vast number of varieties and strains have been\r\ndeveloped, among which the most fastidious taste may readily find\r\nits ideal. Some of these have been perfected from the standpoint of\r\nutility, while with others the guiding principle has been purely\r\næsthetic. Thus there are breeds which are characterized by their size,\r\nrapid growth, and excellence of flesh; others which have been developed\r\nsimply as egg-producing machines and which have even lost the maternal\r\ninstinct for incubation; and still others in which the beauty, the\r\ncomplication, and the perfection of the feathering constitute the\r\nprincipal claims to attention.\r\n\r\nThe standard weights of the heavy varieties, such as Brahmas and\r\nCochins, is now 11 lbs. to 12 lbs. for cocks, and 8½ lbs. to 9½ lbs.\r\nfor hens. In the United States, there has been developed a distinct\r\nAmerican class of medium weight fowls, of which the Plymouth Rocks\r\nand Wyandottes are the most popular varieties. The cocks of these\r\nvarieties weigh from 8½ lbs. to 9½ lbs., and the hens 6½ lbs. to 7½\r\nlbs. They are valued both for their flesh and for egg production. The\r\nrapid multiplication of varieties by modern breeders is illustrated\r\nby the Wyandottes, which came into existence during the last third of\r\nthe century, and of which there are now five distinct varieties: the\r\nSilver, Golden, White, Buff, and Black.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRENCH COACH-HORSE “GLADIATOR.”]\r\n\r\nThe breeder’s art has been most successfully brought to bear in\r\nstimulating the function of egg production. Not many years ago, an\r\naverage yield of 125 to 150 eggs annually from the hens of even a small\r\nflock was considered all that it was possible to obtain, but at present\r\nthere are varieties which may be relied upon to produce more than 200\r\neggs annually. In some instances, it is alleged that an average of\r\nnearly 300 eggs a year has been reached in small flocks which have been\r\ngiven special care.\r\n\r\nIt should not be forgotten that there has also been great improvement\r\nin the various breeds of horses. The heavy draught horses have been\r\nbred into a more compact form, with better legs and feet and less\r\nsluggish disposition. The most noticeable advance has, however,\r\nbeen in the lighter grades of horses, and this has largely been\r\naccomplished by infusing the blood of the English thoroughbred. The\r\nFrench, by systematically breeding the heavy mares of the country\r\nto thoroughbred stallions with careful selection of the offspring,\r\nproduced an extremely valuable breed of carriage-horses, known there as\r\nthe _demi-sang_, and which have been imported into the United States\r\nas French coach-horses. These animals, beautiful in form and action,\r\nhave been brought to a high degree of perfection, and the breed is so\r\nwell established that its good qualities are reliably transmitted from\r\ngeneration to generation.\r\n\r\nThere are also German coach-horses and similar breeds in several other\r\ncountries, which have been established by following the same general\r\nplan as that adopted by the French. These breeds are peculiarly the\r\nproduct of the nineteenth century, and are in their most valuable\r\ncondition as the century closes.\r\n\r\nThe American trotting horse has without doubt been one of the most\r\nremarkable triumphs of the breeder’s art which the century has seen.\r\nOriginating in considerable obscurity, but undoubtedly owing much of\r\nits excellence to the thoroughbred, the trotter was born with the\r\ncentury, and has continually increased its speed until the very end.\r\nIt now gives promise of continuing its evolution through at least a\r\nconsiderable part of the twentieth century. In the decade from 1800\r\nto 1810, the best recorded speed at this gait was 2:59; from 1810 to\r\n1820, the time was lowered to 2:48½; from 1830 to 1840, it reached\r\n2:31½; from 1840 to 1850, the limit was 2:28; from 1850 to 1860, 2:19¼;\r\nfrom 1860 to 1870, 2:17¼; from 1870 to 1880, 2:12¾; from 1880 to 1890,\r\n2:08¾; and from 1890 to 1898, 2:03¾.\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary and constantly progressing increase in speed during\r\nthe century has excited the interest and admiration of the world. It\r\nis, however, quite generally admitted that too much attention has been\r\ngiven to speed and not enough to disposition, size, conformation, and\r\nsoundness, to bring the animals to their highest value for other than\r\nracing purposes.\r\n\r\nOwing to the relatively small extent of agricultural territory and the\r\ngreat development of manufactures, Great Britain has become the best\r\nmarket in the world for animals and animal products. The purchases\r\nof cattle, sheep, beef, and mutton have been particularly large.\r\nConsidering, first, the importations of cattle, it is found that during\r\nthe five years from 1861 to 1865 inclusive, the average number was\r\n174,177; from 1866 to 1870, the average was 194,947; from 1871 to 1875,\r\n215,990; from 1876 to 1880, 272,745; from 1881 to 1885, 387,282; from\r\n1886 to 1890, 438,098; from 1891 to 1895, 448,139; and for the two\r\nyears 1896 and 1897, 590,437.\r\n\r\nThis unparalleled growth in the consumption of foreign cattle has\r\nhad a marked influence in encouraging the development of the cattle\r\nindustry of some other parts of the world, particularly in the United\r\nStates, Canada, and Argentina. The export trade of the United States\r\nhas developed even more rapidly than the import trade of Great Britain.\r\nIn 1871 this traffic was in its infancy, and but 20,530 head of cattle\r\nwere exported, valued at $400,000. By 1879 the number had increased\r\nto 136,720, valued at $8,300,000. Then came the British restrictions\r\nprohibiting American cattle from leaving the docks where landed, and\r\nrequiring their slaughter on these docks within ten days from their\r\narrival. These regulations were a rude shock to the American cattle\r\ngrower, and led to measures here for the control and eradication of\r\nthe cattle diseases which were cited by the English authorities as the\r\ncause of their unfavorable action.\r\n\r\nAlthough the pleuro-pneumonia, about which most apprehension was\r\nexpressed, has long since been extirpated, and an elaborate inspection\r\nservice has been organized to prevent any affected animals from leaving\r\nour shores, the restrictions have been continued. Fortunately, the\r\ntrade was only temporarily embarrassed, and has continued its growth\r\nnotwithstanding this obstruction. In 1889 these exports first exceeded\r\n200,000, and the following year reached 394,836. Since that time the\r\nnumber has fluctuated between 287,000 and 392,000, until 1898, when it\r\nreached the enormous aggregate of 439,255, valued at $37,800,000. Not\r\nquite all of these cattle have gone to Great Britain, but that has been\r\nthe destination of by far the greater part.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PACING HORSE “STAR POINTER.” TIME, 1 M. 59¼ S.]\r\n\r\nThe exports of sheep have varied widely, according to the fluctuations\r\nof the markets at home and abroad. From 1870 to 1873 the number varied\r\nfrom 39,000 to 66,000; from 1874 to 1889, it varied from 110,000 to\r\n337,000. In 1890 the exports were but 67,500; in 1891, 60,900; in 1892,\r\n46,900; and in 1893, 37,200. Beginning with 1894, the exports of sheep\r\nagain increased, reaching in that year 132,000; in 1895 they were\r\n405,000; and in 1896, 491,000. In 1897 there was a decrease to 244,000,\r\nand in 1898 a further decrease to 200,000, valued at $1,213,000.\r\n\r\nThe export trade in horses and mules was inconsiderable, varying from\r\n2000 to 8000 a year until 1895, when 14,000 horses and 4800 mules\r\nwere shipped to foreign ports. This trade increased in 1896 to 25,126\r\nhorses and 6534 mules, together valued at about $4,000,000. In 1897 a\r\nfurther increase was made to 39,532 horses and 7753 mules, the value\r\nbeing $5,400,000. And, finally, in 1898 there were exported the largest\r\nnumber ever sent from this country, amounting to 51,150 horses and\r\n6996 mules, valued at $6,691,000.\r\n\r\nSwine are not exported in very large numbers, as they do not stand\r\nshipping well. The largest number sent abroad was 158,581, in 1874, the\r\nvalue of which was $1,625,837. In 1897 and 1898 there were only 16,800\r\nexported each year. Very few of these cross the ocean.\r\n\r\nThis resumé of the development of the international traffic in live\r\nanimals and the status of the animal industry would not be complete\r\nwithout some reference to the markets for animal products. The quantity\r\nof foreign meat consumed in Great Britain is most remarkable. The\r\nimports of fresh beef, which from 1861 to 1865 averaged but 15,772\r\ncwts., had increased in the years 1891 to 1895 to an average of\r\n2,020,668 cwts., and in 1897 exceeded 3,000,000 cwts. The proportion\r\nof this supplied by the United States is indicated by the returns for\r\n1896, giving a total of 2,659,700 cwts. of imported beef, of which this\r\ncountry furnished 2,074,644 cwts.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain also imported 3,193,276 cwts. of fresh mutton in 1897,\r\nmore than nine tenths of it being frozen carcasses from Argentina and\r\nAustralasia. Of fresh and salted pork, the United States supplied\r\n4,183,800 cwts. out of a total of 6,563,688 cwts. The principal other\r\nanimal products imported by that country are, 1,750,000 cwts. of lard,\r\n276,458 cwts. of rabbits, and 1,683,810,000 eggs.\r\n\r\nThe continent of Europe consumes considerable quantities of lard\r\nand salted pork, which are largely furnished by the United States,\r\nnotwithstanding the unfavorable attitude of the governments towards\r\nsuch traffic and the existence of many annoying and injurious\r\nregulations. Fresh meats from America have been practically excluded.\r\n\r\nThe British markets for dairy products and wool have also had\r\nconsiderable influence upon the prosperity of the animal industries in\r\nvarious parts of the world. The rapidly increasing demand for dairy\r\nproducts is worthy of attention. In 1877 there were imported into the\r\nUnited Kingdom 1,637,403 cwts. of butter and margarine. In 1897 the\r\nimports had been raised to 3,217,801 cwts. of butter and 936,543 cwts.\r\nof margarine, or a total of 4,154,344 cwts., being two and one half\r\ntimes the quantity imported in 1877.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of cheese imported in 1877 was 1,653,920 cwts., and had\r\nincreased to 2,603,608 cwts. in 1897.\r\n\r\nThe country supplying the largest quantity of butter in 1896 was\r\nDenmark, with France second, Sweden third, Holland fourth, and\r\nAustralasia fifth. Nearly all of the margarine came from Holland. The\r\nlargest quantity of cheese came from Canada, the United States being\r\nsecond, with less than half the quantity furnished by her neighbor to\r\nthe north, and Holland third.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of wool imported by the United Kingdom, France, Germany,\r\nAustria, Belgium, United States, and other consuming countries,\r\nincreased from 200,000 tons, in the decade 1821–1830, to 3,300,000 tons\r\nin 1871–1880. This wool came principally from Australia, River Plate,\r\nSouth Africa, Russia, and Spain.\r\n\r\nThe excess of imports of wool into the United Kingdom over the exports\r\nwere, in 1892, 312,217,111 lbs., and in 1896, 383,845,450 lbs. Of the\r\ntotal quantity imported by the United Kingdom in 1896, the United\r\nStates supplied but 4,500,000 lbs., while Australasia furnished\r\n477,600,000 lbs.; Cape of Good Hope, 70,000,000 lbs.; British East\r\nIndies, 43,000,000 lbs.; Natal, 21,000,000 lbs.; France, 20,000,000\r\nlbs.; Turkey, 16,500,000 lbs.; and Belgium, 11,400,000 lbs.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of the last decade of the nineteenth century has been to\r\ndisplace horses and adopt mechanical motors. The great increase of\r\nsteam railroads, cable cars, electric cars, bicycles, and automobile\r\nvehicles has so reduced the demand for these animals that their value\r\nhas decreased over fifty per cent. While there is still a good market\r\nfor horses suitable for carriage use, for drays, for army service,\r\nand for agricultural purposes, buyers are becoming more critical and\r\nthe future is uncertain. As it is five or six years after a breeding\r\nestablishment is started before any of the horses produced can be\r\nplaced upon the market, the effect of this uncertainty is to discourage\r\nwould-be horse breeders and influence them toward other enterprises.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AUTOMOBILE OR HORSELESS CARRIAGE.]\r\n\r\nThe end of the century also finds the sheep industry in a depressed\r\ncondition on account of over-production. The vast quantities of wool\r\ngrown in Australasia and South Africa have clogged the markets to such\r\nan extent that Australian wool in the London market has dropped from\r\n15d. per pound in 1877 to 8¼d. in 1897, and South African wool from\r\n15¾d. to 7½d. during the same period. Other wools have fallen in about\r\nthe same proportion. Although sheep are raised for the production of\r\nmutton as well as wool, and the tendency in the United States has been\r\ntowards the breeding of mutton sheep, the value of these animals has\r\nbeen reduced about one half.\r\n\r\nThere have been periods of depression with the cattle and swine\r\nindustries, but prices have been well sustained. The European markets\r\nare yearly requiring larger supplies, and the stock of beef-producing\r\ncattle in the United States, in proportion to the population, is\r\nrapidly diminishing. The decreased number is in a slight degree\r\ncounterbalanced by earlier maturity; but when due allowance is made for\r\nthis, it is plain that the United States has not the surplus of beef\r\nwhich it boasted a few years ago. At the same time, our meat trade in\r\nthe markets of the world is threatened with more serious competition\r\nfrom South America, Australasia, and even Russia.\r\n\r\nThe century closes in a period of wonderful achievements in the\r\nextension of transportation facilities and in the education of the\r\nmasses in all parts of the world. The producer in South America,\r\nAfrica, and Australasia keeps abreast with the most enlightened\r\nstock-growers of Europe and America in his knowledge of the best\r\nbreeds, the most economical methods of feeding, and the most desirable\r\nhandling of his products. There is no animal product so perishable but\r\nthat it can now be sent from the antipodes to London in good condition.\r\nAll of this has brought surprising changes in the traffic between\r\ndifferent countries and in the modification of industries to meet new\r\nconditions. The producers of the most distant parts of the world are\r\naggressively entering our nearest markets. Competition is becoming more\r\nintense, and commercial rivalry is assuming more the appearance of\r\nwarfare than heretofore. The nations of the world are actively engaged\r\nin assisting their people in this struggle. They diffuse information\r\nas to the best and most economical methods of production, they seek\r\nout new markets, they subsidize transportation lines, they assist in\r\nthe introduction of new kinds of goods, they sustain their subjects in\r\nthe most aggressive practices, they exclude the products of competing\r\ncountries by tariffs and hostile sentiment, by discriminations,\r\nby unpacking, delaying, or damaging goods, under the pretext of\r\ninspection, and by burdensome charges and regulations. Some countries\r\nhave gone so far as to absolutely prohibit competing products for\r\ncomprehensive but indefinite sanitary reasons.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of this commercial warfare cannot be foreseen. The\r\nstruggle has been, and is, fiercest over the international traffic\r\nin animals and animal products. The greatest forces of the world\r\nare to-day contending as to what the future shall be. The United\r\nStates has only recently begun to realize that it also must take\r\npart in this commercial struggle, if it would retain markets for its\r\nproducts and secure prosperity for its people. Its trade has been\r\nunjustly prohibited and discriminated against, its merchants have been\r\nunfairly treated and insulted, and its protests have been treated\r\nwith ill-disguised contempt. Notwithstanding all these efforts at\r\nrepression, American trade has gone on increasing at an amazing rate,\r\nthe forbearance of the government having been far overbalanced by the\r\nenergy of the people. Having grown to be one of the greatest powers\r\nof the world, with magnificent resources yet undeveloped, the United\r\nStates will no doubt maintain its position and continue to supply\r\nthe markets of the world with the best animals, the best meats, and\r\nprobably with the best dairy products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLEADING WARS OF THE CENTURY\r\n\r\nBY MAJOR GENERAL JOSEPH WHEELER, U. S. ARMY.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. WARS OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the nineteenth century, in everything that pertains\r\nto civilization, arts, and sciences, has been greater than the total\r\nprogress in any decade of centuries in the history of the world, and\r\nthis is equally true in regard to the art and science of WAR; for the\r\nexpenditure of blood and treasure in the prosecution of the wars and\r\nthe fighting of the battles of this century far exceeds that of any\r\nother like period.\r\n\r\nThe first year of the nineteenth century dawned upon the United States\r\nat peace with the world. In September, 1800, Napoleon, finding that\r\nhe could not coerce the young nation into “an entangling alliance,”\r\nand fearing lest the United States should join England in opposing\r\nhim, found it his best policy to conclude a peace. The brilliant\r\nachievements of the newly organized navy, under Commodore Truxton, not\r\nonly illuminated these early pages of our history, but established a\r\nprestige never yet forfeited; for the history of this branch of our\r\nservice is unparalleled from the first effort, during the Revolution,\r\nof Esek Hopkins, to that of George Dewey at Manila, and Sampson and\r\nSchley at Santiago.\r\n\r\nWAR WITH BARBARY STATES.—In 1803 the United States determined to end\r\nthe piracy of the Barbary States, and an expedition under Commodore\r\nPreble was sent to the Mediterranean. The Philadelphia, while pursuing\r\na pirate, was grounded off the coast of Tripoli, and captured by the\r\nTripolitans, who made slaves of the crew and prisoners of the officers.\r\nIn February, 1804, Captain Decatur, with seventy-six men from his ship,\r\nthe Intrepid, boarded the Philadelphia, killed or drove off the Moors,\r\nfired the vessel, and returned without the loss of a man, although\r\nfiercely attacked by the shore batteries. In July, Commodore Preble,\r\nwith his squadron, laid siege to Tripoli, but his bombardment was\r\nineffective. General Eaton, consul to Tunis, induced Hamet, the brother\r\nof Yusef, who had usurped the sovereignty of Tripoli, to furnish him a\r\ntroop of Arab cavalry and a company of Greeks. With these, and a band\r\nof Tripolitan rebels and a force of American sailors, he crossed the\r\nBarcan Desert, stormed and captured Derne, an eastern seaport of Yusef.\r\nThe latter was glad to make peace, and a treaty was signed June 4, 1805.\r\n\r\nINDIAN WARS.—From 1809 to 1811 fighting with the Indians in the South\r\nand Northwest was constant. General Harrison and the celebrated Indian\r\nchief Tecumseh were the principal actors.\r\n\r\nWAR OF 1812.—The contest between England and France for the dominion\r\nof the seas was the cause of the war of 1812. England declared the\r\nGerman and French coast to be in a state of blockade. Napoleon, in\r\n1806, made the same declaration regarding British ports. In 1807,\r\nEngland prohibited trade with the coast of France. American commerce\r\nwas injured and almost destroyed by the combined action of the two\r\npowers. Four years were consumed in negotiations, with constant\r\naggressions on the part of England, and on June 19, 1812, Congress\r\ndeclared war. The great error of the campaign was the attempted\r\ninvasion of Canada. Had the war been made entirely upon the seas, an\r\nearly peace might have ensued.\r\n\r\nThe war began on the Lakes, and, repulsed in the effort to make a stand\r\non the Canada shore, and falling back, Hull surrendered Detroit, August\r\n5. Again, at Queenstown, October 13, the Americans were defeated with\r\nthe loss of a thousand men. Altogether the first year of the war was a\r\ndisastrous one on land.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMODORE STEPHEN DECATUR.]\r\n\r\nAt sea, the navy, consisting of not more than a half-dozen frigates,\r\nwith its magnificently disciplined officers, had been eminently\r\nsuccessful. On August 13, the Essex, Captain Porter, captured the\r\nBritish sloop Alert; on August 19, Captain Hull, commanding the\r\nConstitution, destroyed the Guerriere off the Gulf of St. Lawrence;\r\nOctober 18, the Wasp, Captain Jones, captured the Frolic, but later in\r\nthe day both the Frolic and the Wasp fell into the hands of the British\r\nship Poictiers. October 25, Captain Decatur, with the frigate United\r\nStates, captured the Macedonian off the Azores; on December 29, after a\r\ndesperate fight in the South Atlantic, Captain Bainbridge, commanding\r\nthe Constitution, defeated the British ship Java.\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1813 opened on the Canadian frontier with the several\r\ndivisions in command of Generals Harrison, Dearborn, and Hampton. On\r\nJune 8, General Winchester, with eight hundred Kentuckians, drove the\r\nBritish and Indians, under Proctor, from Frenchtown, on the River\r\nRaisin, but returning with a force of fifteen hundred, they obliged\r\nWinchester to surrender, which he only consented to do under Proctor’s\r\npromise to protect the Americans from the Indians; which promise\r\nProctor treacherously disregarded, and marched away, leaving the sick\r\nand wounded Kentuckians to be massacred. Henceforth the Kentucky war\r\ncry was, “Remember the River Raisin,” and many were the British and\r\nIndians who had cause to dread that slogan. May 5, General Harrison,\r\nreinforced by General Green Clay and his Kentucky troops, repulsed the\r\nBritish and their dusky allies under Tecumseh. July 21, they returned\r\nfour thousand strong, but were again repulsed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMODORE PERRY AT BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE.]\r\n\r\nThe Americans, by wonderful exertion and hard work, built and equipped,\r\nat Erie, a squadron of nine ships with fifty-five guns, the command\r\nof which was given to Commodore Perry. September 10, Perry won his\r\ngrand victory on Lake Erie, over the English squadron of six ships and\r\nsixty-three guns. This was the turning point of the war, and Perry’s\r\nname goes down to posterity with the immortal names that never die.\r\nOn October 5, General Harrison, conveyed by Perry’s ships, landed his\r\nforces in Canada and completely destroyed Proctor’s army, Tecumseh\r\nbeing among the slain. So ended the war in the Northwest.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, General Dearborn was fighting with varying success\r\nin Upper Canada. Jackson, in the South, was avenging the Fort Mimms\r\nmassacre, finally crushing the Creeks early in the next year. The\r\nBritish, under the odious Admiral Cochrane, plundered and ravaged and\r\nburned everything in reach, from Lewistown to the Carolina coast,\r\nseizing the negroes and selling them in the West Indies. During this\r\nyear the American navy continued to be successful, meeting few losses,\r\nthough the fighting was even more desperate.\r\n\r\nJuly 5, 1814, the Americans defeated the British at Chippewa; and\r\non the 25th was fought the battle of Lundy’s Lane, where Generals\r\nBrown and Scott were wounded. In this desperate battle, eight hundred\r\nmen were lost on either side; and though the battle was undecisive,\r\nit had the effect of a victory for the Americans. August 14, five\r\nthousand troops, under General Ross, were landed on the Patuxent, and,\r\ndefeating General Winder, who made a stand with a handful of men near\r\nBladensburg, proceeded to the city of Washington. After burning the\r\ncapitol and White House, and other buildings, they hastily withdrew.\r\nThe attempt to take Baltimore proved abortive, and on September 14\r\nthe British reëmbarked. It was at this time that Key wrote the “Star\r\nSpangled Banner.” August 15, the enemy were repulsed at Fort Erie\r\nwith the loss of one thousand men, and a month later were finally\r\ndriven back. The whole British squadron on Lake Champlain surrendered\r\nto Commodore MacDonough after a terrific fight for several hours, on\r\nSeptember 17, and on the same day the British army of twelve thousand\r\nwas forced to retreat from Plattsburg by General Macomb’s force of\r\nforty-five hundred.\r\n\r\nIn Florida the Spaniards had allowed, if not encouraged, the English to\r\nuse their territory to fit out expeditions against the United States.\r\nJackson, with two thousand men, took possession of Pensacola on the 7th\r\nof November, driving out the British.\r\n\r\nDecember the 28th the British opened fire on New Orleans; again, on\r\nJanuary 1, 1815; and on January 8 Packenham, with twelve thousand men,\r\nmade his supreme effort. Jackson’s force was now about six thousand.\r\nThe British were driven to their ships after losing two thousand killed\r\nand wounded, their general being among the slain. The American loss was\r\nseven killed and six wounded. The war was kept up on the ocean until\r\nMarch, the last capture being that of the British brig Penguin by the\r\nAmerican sloop-of-war Hornet, in the South Atlantic.\r\n\r\nThe treaty of Ghent had been signed on the 24th of September, 1814,\r\nand the news of the glorious victory at New Orleans reached Washington\r\nsimultaneously with that of the signing of the treaty. The war had\r\nbeen so distasteful to the people of New England that Massachusetts\r\nand Connecticut had passed laws directly antagonistic to those of\r\nthe United States, and hostilities between the Federal and State\r\ngovernments were feared, which, perhaps, were only averted by the\r\nending of the war. The issues leading to the war of 1812 were left\r\nunsettled by the treaty, but England never again attempted to interfere\r\nwith American shipping.\r\n\r\nSECOND WAR WITH BARBARY STATES.—Immediately on the close of the\r\nwar of 1812, the Algerians, supposing that the American navy was\r\nbadly crippled, began again their depredations on American commerce.\r\nCommodore Decatur was sent to the Mediterranean with a squadron, and\r\nonce more gave them an American drubbing. June 17, 1815, he destroyed\r\ntwo Algerine vessels; June 28, in front of the city of Algiers, he\r\ndemanded the release of all American prisoners, indemnification for all\r\nproperty destroyed, and a relinquishment of all claims for tribute from\r\nthe United States. The Dey quickly assented to the terms, and signed a\r\ntreaty of peace. Tunis, Tripoli, and Morocco were likewise brought to\r\nterms, the United States thus taking the lead of all the other powers\r\nin its determination to break up the piracy of the Barbary States.\r\n\r\nMEXICAN WAR.—The Republic of Texas became, by its own request and by\r\nAct of Congress, one of the United States July 4, 1845. Mexico prepared\r\nfor war; the United States took measures to protect the new State.\r\nMarch 8, 1846, General Zachary Taylor marched with fifteen hundred men\r\nto a point on the Rio Grande opposite Matamoras, where he erected Fort\r\nBrown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCHOOLSHIP SARATOGA.]\r\n\r\nTo the secretary of war, William L. Marcy, and to General Winfield\r\nScott was due the plan of campaign, the battles of which, like\r\ninstantaneous flashes of victory from the beginning of the war until\r\nits close, illumine the pages of American history. Then, as now,\r\nCongress was slow to respond to the needs of the military branch of the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nApril 24, 1846, hostilities began. General Taylor advanced into Mexico\r\nand, May 8, won the brilliant victory of Palo Alto, and again, the next\r\nday, the battle of Resaca de la Palma. Taylor’s force was less than\r\none third the number of the enemy, whose loss was one thousand. These\r\ntwo battles crushed the flower of Santa Anna’s army. Taylor returned\r\nto the relief of Fort Brown, where the brave garrison had sustained a\r\ncannonade for 168 hours. September 24, Monterey and its garrison of\r\nnine thousand men were taken by General Taylor with six thousand.\r\n\r\nFebruary 23, 1847, Taylor gained the glorious victory of Buena Vista,\r\nin which the Mexican loss was 2000, the American, 714. At times the\r\nMexicans were within a few yards of Bragg’s guns. “A little more\r\ngrape, Captain Bragg,” was Taylor’s celebrated order, the execution\r\nof which decided the day. The American loss was severe in officers.\r\nTaylor’s force, depleted by more than two thirds, which had been\r\nsent to reinforce General Scott, was barely forty-five hundred; the\r\nMexican troops numbered twenty thousand. Captain Fremont, assisted\r\nby Commodores Sloat and Stockton, had subjugated California; General\r\nKearney and Colonel Doniphan, Northern Mexico. Doniphan defeated the\r\nMexicans at Bracito, December 25, 1846, and at Sacramento, February\r\n8, 1847, and took possession of Chihuahua, a city of forty thousand\r\ninhabitants, and marched to join General Wool at Saltillo, March 22.\r\n\r\nEarly in January, 1847, General Scott reached the mouth of the Rio\r\nGrande, where he awaited the eight thousand troops sent by General\r\nTaylor. This raised his force to twelve thousand. These were landed at\r\nSacrificios. The Americans debarked just below Vera Cruz between sunset\r\nand ten o’clock on the night of March 8 without a single accident.\r\nWith wonderful skill the investiture of Vera Cruz and the castle of\r\nSt. John de Ulloa was completed. On March 22 the Governor of Vera Cruz\r\nwas summoned to surrender. Day and night the mortar batteries played\r\nupon the city, the fleet ably assisting; and on the 29th the stars and\r\nstripes floated above the walls of city and fortress. The Americans\r\nlost but two officers and a few soldiers. April 18, the magnificent\r\nvictory at Cerro Gordo, where three thousand Mexicans were captured,\r\nwas won; April 19, Jalapa was taken; April 22, Pecote, the strongest of\r\nMexican forts, was captured; and May 15, Puebla surrendered to General\r\nWorth. Ten thousand prisoners, seven hundred cannon, ten thousand\r\nstands of arms, and thirty thousand shot and shells were captured\r\nwithin two months. When the army entered Puebla it numbered but\r\nforty-five hundred.\r\n\r\nReinforcements reaching him, Scott set out from Puebla to the valley of\r\nMexico on August 7. August 20, the heights of Contreras were assailed\r\nand taken, and the battle of Churubusco—with nine thousand Americans\r\nagainst thirty thousand Mexicans—was fought and won. September 8,\r\nMolino del Rey was taken; September 13, the heights of Chapultepec.\r\nThe Mexicans fled from the capital, and the victorious American army\r\nmarched in and took possession of the city, September 14, 1847. Here\r\nScott and his noble warriors rested until the treaty was concluded at\r\nGuadalupe Hidalgo, February 2, 1848, and peace was proclaimed, July 4,\r\nby President Polk. Guadalupe Hidalgo, New Mexico, and California were\r\nceded to the United States, $15,000,000 paid to Mexico, and the debts\r\ndue from Mexico to American citizens were assumed by the United States.\r\n\r\nTHE CIVIL WAR.—It is not here the place to rehearse or to discuss\r\nthe causes which led to America’s Civil War, a war perhaps the most\r\nstupendous recorded in history. Looking backward, after the bloody\r\nfoot-prints have been well nigh obliterated by the growth of a\r\ngeneration, we can see that the trend of human progress, the political\r\nproblems confronting the federated States, in the solution of which\r\nwere evolved elements of discord, the inherited antagonism between\r\nthe Puritans of the North and the Cavaliers of the South, all\r\ncombined to make the conflict inevitable. For more than a decade of\r\nyears grievances had been growing and rumblings were heard, like the\r\nimprisoned fires beneath the surface of the earth, until the election\r\nof Abraham Lincoln as President, pledged to a policy believed to be\r\ninimical to the South, caused the outburst of the volcano, whose fierce\r\nfires and molten lava for four years spread desolation over the land.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBERT E. LEE AT CHAPULTEPEC.]\r\n\r\nTime and milder judgment have very nearly smoothed away the wrinkles\r\nof discord, and the close of the century finds the nation a reunited\r\npeople, whose new compact is written in the life-blood of her sons on\r\nthe battlefields of the recent war with Spain.\r\n\r\nDecember 20, 1860, South Carolina; January 9, 1861, Mississippi;\r\nJanuary 10, Florida; January 11, Alabama; January 18, Georgia; January\r\n23, Louisiana, and February 1, Texas, one by one asserted their\r\nsupposed right to withdraw from the federal compact, and enacted\r\nordinances of secession in their several state conventions. Each State,\r\nas it took action, claimed and possessed itself of all government\r\nproperty, forts, guns, ammunition, within its borders, and armed its\r\nmilitia for garrison duty. A convention of delegates from the seceded\r\nStates, held February 4, 1861, at Montgomery, Alabama, organized a new\r\nfederation, to be known as the Confederate States of America, chose\r\nJefferson Davis President and Alexander Stephens Vice-President, and\r\nset the whole machinery of a provisional government in working order.\r\nJuly 20, Richmond became the capital of the Southern Confederacy.\r\nVirginia seceded April 17; Arkansas, May 6; North Carolina, May 20, and\r\nTennessee, June 8. Kentucky declared neutrality.\r\n\r\nLincoln, upon assuming the executive chair, March 4, 1861, found the\r\ntreasury depleted, the army of only sixteen thousand men scattered in\r\nthe West, and many of its best officers already with the Confederacy.\r\nThe navy had been sadly neglected by Congress, partly because this\r\nbranch of the service had been steadily antagonized by the West, so\r\nthat at the beginning of the war, both as to vessels and armament, it\r\nwas by no means in a condition for active service. As in the army, some\r\nof its most valuable officers had espoused the cause of their native\r\nStates, and the South Atlantic and Gulf ports, being in possession\r\nof the new federation, left the United States vessels no place of\r\nrefuge. With unlimited means at command, the Union navy increased the\r\nnumber of its vessels to 588—75 of them ironclads—with 4443 guns\r\nand 30,000 men, before the end of 1862. Torpedoes and steel rams were\r\nfirst used during this war, and monitors, just invented, were used\r\nby the United States. With a nucleus of 10 vessels, around which to\r\nbuild its navy, the Confederacy had, by November, raised the number to\r\n34. Until the blockade became effective, “cotton was king;” for, in\r\nOctober, 1861, the Nashville, running out with a heavy consignment,\r\nbrought back into Charleston in exchange a cargo worth $3,000,000.\r\nVessel after vessel was bought from English shipbuilders, among them\r\nthe celebrated Alabama, which, in the fourteen months of her service,\r\ncaptured sixty-nine prizes, and destroyed ten million dollars’ worth of\r\nmerchandise. The armored ram Stonewall was bought in France.\r\n\r\nApril 12, 1861, Fort Sumter, in Charleston harbor, was forced to\r\nsurrender to the Confederates, and the first shot at the old flag\r\nushered in the long, bitter struggle.\r\n\r\nTroops were called for by Lincoln. Lieutenant-General Scott, the\r\nveteran hero of Mexico, was in command of the army. In three months,\r\nthree hundred thousand men were in the field. One hundred thousand had\r\nswarmed to the Confederate ranks. General McClellan was sent to the\r\nfront and, after the resignation of Scott in the latter part of the\r\nyear, was made commander of the army.\r\n\r\nJuly 21, the battle of Bull Run was fought. The Union troops were\r\ndisastrously routed and retreated in confusion to Washington. The army\r\ndid little more during this year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CASTLE WILLIAM. MILITARY PRISON, GOVERNOR’S ISLAND, NEW\r\nYORK HARBOR.]\r\n\r\nApril 21, after setting fire to and destroying the Navy Yard and ships,\r\nNorfolk was evacuated by the Union forces. The frigate Merrimac, which\r\nhad been sunk, was raised by the Confederates, plated with iron,\r\nrenamed “Virginia,” and became the scourge of the shipping off the\r\nVirginia coast.\r\n\r\nThe navy, as is usual, and because of its very organization, got in its\r\neffective work much earlier than did the army, and the seizure of the\r\nforts and ports on the coast of the seceded States began at once. Fort\r\nHatteras was taken August 29; Port Royal, in South Carolina, November\r\n7. November 7 a naval officer, by overhauling an English mail steamer\r\nand taking off Messrs. Mason and Slidell, who had been appointed\r\ncommissioners of the Confederate States to France and England, very\r\nnearly caused a complication with the latter power. Mr. Seward’s\r\ndiplomacy settled the incident amicably, and the commissioners were\r\nallowed to proceed upon their mission, which, however, proved futile.\r\nBy the close of the year, Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri, at first\r\ndoubtful, were securely in the Union, though many of their citizens\r\nwere in the Southern army.\r\n\r\n1862.—February 6, General Grant, commanding the army of the Tennessee,\r\nwith the assistance of Commodore Foote and his gunboats, captured Fort\r\nHenry, on the Tennessee River, and, on the 16th, Fort Donelson on the\r\nCumberland. The Federal forces had reached the number of four hundred\r\nand fifty thousand, of which McClellan had two hundred thousand.\r\n\r\nMay 23, at Front Royal, and May 25, at Winchester, “Stonewall” Jackson\r\ndefeated the Union troops and forced them across the Potomac. Banks,\r\nFremont, and McDowell, concentrating their forces, bore down on\r\nJackson, who slipped through their lines, and, on June 9, defeated\r\nShields at Fort Republic.\r\n\r\nThe cry of the Northern press was, “On to Richmond,” and McClellan\r\nendeavored to obey the command. He had arrived not far from the city,\r\nbetween the York and James rivers, when he was defeated in the bloody\r\nbattle of Seven Pines, May 31 and June 1. The Confederate General\r\nJohnston was wounded, and General Lee was assigned to the command of\r\nthe army of Northern Virginia, which he retained until the end.\r\n\r\nThe Seven Days’ battles, from June 25 to July 1, were fought at fearful\r\ncost to the Confederates; nevertheless, “it was a glorious victory,”\r\nand the siege of Richmond was raised. Lee advanced toward Washington,\r\nmet the armies of Banks and Pope, and defeated them in the second\r\nbattle of Bull Run, August 29 and 30, and at Chantilly, September 1\r\nand 2, forcing Pope’s army to retreat to Washington. The clamor in the\r\nSouth had been, “On to Washington.” Lee crossed the Potomac at Harper’s\r\nFerry and took twelve thousand prisoners. McClellan, who had been\r\nrecalled, met the Confederates at Sharpsburg (Antietam), September 17,\r\nand fought a battle with undecisive results. Each side lost about ten\r\nthousand men, and Lee returned.\r\n\r\nThe Union army under Burnside, who had superseded McClellan, met a\r\nfearful repulse at Fredericksburg, December 13, with a loss of fourteen\r\nthousand. The Confederate loss was five thousand.\r\n\r\nDecember 31, January 1 and 2, was fought the terrible battle of\r\nMurfreesboro, Tennessee, where Bragg’s force was 35,000, and his loss\r\nin killed, wounded, and missing, 10,466. Rosecrans’s force was 43,400,\r\nand his loss 12,595.\r\n\r\nMarch 8, the Virginia attacked the Union fleet at Fortress Monroe and\r\ndestroyed the Cumberland and the Congress. The next day, the Monitor\r\nattacked the Virginia, and, after five hours’ fighting, succeeded\r\nin disabling her so that she returned to Norfolk. The Virginia was\r\ndestroyed by the Confederates before evacuating Norfolk, May 10.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Farragut, with a fleet of 45 vessels, entered the Mississippi\r\nand bombarded the forts of St. Philip and Jackson. Despising the fear\r\nof mines and torpedoes, he continued on his course, defeating the\r\nConfederate fleet, and, together with General Butler, entered New\r\nOrleans April 25. During this year the navy, with the assistance of\r\nland forces, had retaken all important ports on the Virginia, North\r\nCarolina, and Georgia coasts, seriously interfering with the blockade\r\nrunning, upon which the Confederacy depended for its foreign supplies.\r\nThe year 1862 closed with no advantage having been gained on either\r\nside.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERALS ROBERT E. LEE AND STONEWALL JACKSON.]\r\n\r\n1863.—On January 1, Lincoln issued the threatened Emancipation\r\nProclamation. This destroyed the last hope of the Confederacy for\r\nrecognition by England. No event of importance occurred before the\r\nmiddle of spring, when Hooker, who had relieved Burnside, made\r\nanother advance upon Richmond, and was routed by Lee and Jackson at\r\nChancellorsville, May 2, and on the 5th was forced across the Rapidan\r\nwith a loss of seventeen thousand. The Confederate loss was less than\r\nfive thousand. In Jackson’s death the Confederacy received a blow, the\r\nconsequences of which may never be estimated.\r\n\r\nLee’s army again crossed the Potomac for an invasion of the North.\r\nThe Union forces, under Meade, marched in an almost parallel line\r\nwith Lee’s through Maryland into Pennsylvania. They met and fought\r\nat Gettysburg, July 1, 2, and 3, one of the decisive battles of the\r\nworld’s history. Lee was forced to again retire beyond the river. The\r\nUnion could well afford the loss of twenty-three thousand men, but\r\nLee’s loss of twenty thousand of the choice troops of his army was\r\nirreparable.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Grant had been sent to open the Mississippi, and after\r\na six weeks’ siege, on July 4, Vicksburg, with nearly thirty thousand\r\nprisoners and vast quantities of stores, fell into his hands. These two\r\nalmost simultaneous victories greatly encouraged the North, and formed\r\nthe turning point in the history of the war. July 9, Banks’s victory\r\nat Port Hudson accomplished the desired possession of the Mississippi\r\nRiver.\r\n\r\nBragg, who had been sorely pressed by Rosecrans, made a stand at\r\nChickamauga, defeating the Union General Rosecrans, September 19 and\r\n20, and forcing him to retreat to Chattanooga, where he was besieged by\r\nBragg. Grant, with Sherman, coming to his aid, the battles of Lookout\r\nMountain and Missionary Ridge were fought, November 23 and 25, and\r\nBragg was driven back into Georgia.\r\n\r\nThe Federal navy was gradually taking possession of the whole coast,\r\nand Charleston was tightly blockaded. In March the Confederate ship\r\nNashville was sunk in the entrance of the Savannah River.\r\n\r\nDuring this year both governments were forced to resort to\r\nconscription. Lincoln ordered a draft, and, in July, a three days’ riot\r\nin consequence prevailed in New York, during which two million dollars’\r\nworth of property was destroyed.\r\n\r\n1864.—In March, Grant was put in command of the whole Union army, the\r\ngrade of lieutenant-general having been revived in his behalf. He left\r\nSherman in command, repaired to Washington, and, May 3, started on the\r\nthird campaign against Richmond, with a force of one hundred and forty\r\nthousand. Sherman, with one hundred thousand, was to march to Atlanta.\r\nThe whole strength of the Union army at this time was about seven\r\nhundred thousand. Grant had spent some weeks in formulating his plans\r\nof campaigns, from the main features of which he never deviated. The\r\nUnion had at last found the man, and at the same time had acquired the\r\nwisdom to leave the conduct of the war to his judgment; proving, also,\r\nthat “there is no war on record that has not given its man to the world\r\nor shaped the destiny of some other.”\r\n\r\nCrossing the Rapidan, Grant encountered the Confederates, and the\r\nfighting, on the 5th, 6th, and 7th, of the battles of the Wilderness,\r\nwas terrific, but the result undecisive. At Spottsylvania he fought\r\nfrom the 8th to the 18th with fearful loss. June 1, he was repulsed at\r\nCold Harbor, and again on the 3d, and fighting, more or less desultory,\r\ncontinued in that vicinity until the 12th. Since the opening of the\r\ncampaign, the Union army had lost sixty thousand men; the Confederate\r\nthirty thousand. Grant moved on Petersburg and began the siege which\r\nlasted from June until the next April. The western part of Virginia had\r\nseceded from the eastern portion, and, June 20, was admitted into the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL ULYSSES S. GRANT.]\r\n\r\nTo divert Grant, and, if possible, to raise the siege of Petersburg,\r\nin July, Lee sent General Early to threaten Washington and Baltimore,\r\nwhich he accomplished without, however, affecting Grant’s position.\r\nReturning laden with spoils, Early turned, and driving back the\r\nFederal troops invaded Pennsylvania, burning Chambersburg, and came\r\nback again bringing vast quantities of supplies. Sheridan was sent to\r\ndispose of Early and to ravage the valley. At Winchester, he met and\r\ndefeated Early in a very severe fight on October 20, almost destroying\r\nthe force under that general’s command. Sherman set out for Chattanooga\r\non May 7, marching towards Atlanta. At Dalton he met General Johnston’s\r\narmy of fifty thousand men. Johnston’s masterly retreat from Dalton to\r\nAtlanta is unrivaled in military history. He made a stand from May 25\r\nto June 4 at Dallas, but, being outflanked, was obliged to fall back.\r\nThe next stand was made at Great Kenesaw, on June 22, when he repulsed\r\nthe Federals. On the 27th, Sherman made a powerful assault, but was\r\nagain repulsed with a loss of four thousand, Johnston’s loss being\r\nfour hundred; but, again outflanked. Johnston was forced across the\r\nChattahoochie, and July 10 found the Confederate army entrenched in\r\nAtlanta.\r\n\r\nJohnston’s retreating tactics caused the people to clamor for a\r\n“fighting leader,” and Davis, in transferring the command from\r\nJohnston at such a crucial time, committed a grave error. Johnston was\r\nsuperseded by General Hood, whose chief ambition was to fight, which,\r\nin this case, was a great mistake in judgment. On the 20th, 22d, and\r\n28th of July, Hood assaulted the lines of the besiegers, only to be\r\nrepulsed again and again. In these fights more men were lost than\r\nduring Johnston’s long, skillful retreat. An injudicious movement\r\nby Hood separated his command, obliging him to evacuate Atlanta, of\r\nwhich Sherman, on September 2, took possession. In its advance on\r\nAtlanta, the Union army had lost thirty thousand men. Hood saved his\r\narmy and made his way towards Nashville, hoping to divert Sherman from\r\nGeorgia. At Franklin, November 30, he met General Schofield, and drove\r\nhim back to Nashville, from whence General Thomas made a sortie, and\r\nfell upon Hood’s troops, December 15, completely routing them. In the\r\ntwo fights, Hood lost in killed, wounded, and captured over eleven\r\nthousand. With the remnant he escaped into Alabama, and these finally\r\nreached Johnston, participated in his last fight with Sherman, and were\r\nsurrendered at Raleigh with the troops of their old commander.\r\n\r\nNovember 14, Sherman burned Atlanta, cut all telegraph lines and began\r\nhis “March to the Sea,” ravaging, devastating, and utterly destroying\r\neverything in his reach. He was opposed by the Confederate cavalry,\r\nwhich successfully defended the cities of Macon and Augusta, upon which\r\nthe Confederacy mainly depended for the manufacture of munitions of\r\nwar. Sherman entered Savannah on December 22, the advance having cost\r\nhim only 567 men killed and wounded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHERMAN’S MARCH TO THE SEA.]\r\n\r\nOn June 19, the celebrated sea fight between the Kearsarge and the\r\nAlabama took place off Cherbourg, France. The Alabama was sunk after\r\na five hours’ fight. Admiral Semmes was rescued by the Deerhound,\r\nbelonging to an English gentleman, and thus saved from capture. August\r\n5, Commodore Farragut, overcoming the Confederate ram Tennessee and the\r\ngunboats, sailed into Mobile Bay, commanding his fleet from the maintop\r\nof his flagship.\r\n\r\n1865.—The opening of the campaign of 1865 found Grant’s army still\r\nbefore Petersburg. On April 2, he ordered an attack along his whole\r\nline, which had been so lengthened that the lines of Lee’s depleted\r\narmy were very thin. The Confederates were driven back with heavy loss.\r\nLee telegraphed to Davis: “My lines are broken in three places; we can\r\nhold Petersburg no longer. Richmond must be evacuated this evening.”\r\nThat night Admiral Semmes, in obedience to orders, destroyed the\r\nConfederate fleet in the James River. Richmond was in the possession of\r\nthe Union forces the next day, and on April 4 Lincoln held a reception\r\nin Davis’s vacated mansion. Lee attempted to break through Grant’s\r\nlines at Appomattox, but closely pursued by Sheridan, and finding\r\nfurther retreat impossible, he surrendered with about twenty-six\r\nthousand men on the 9th of April.\r\n\r\nGrant’s magnanimous terms were worthy of his fame. The troops were\r\nparoled on condition of promise not to take up arms until exchanged.\r\nThe officers were permitted to keep baggage and side arms, and all were\r\nto retain their horses, as, Grant said, “they would be needed in the\r\ncrops.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEE’S SURRENDER AT APPOMATTOX.]\r\n\r\nTurning northward from Savannah, Sherman continued his march and\r\nreached Fayetteville, North Carolina. Wilmington had been captured\r\nearly in the year by a land and naval force. Johnston had been\r\nreinforced by the garrison which had been forced to evacuate Charleston\r\nand the remnant of Hood’s army, and had several severe fights, with no\r\ndecisive results, with Sherman, who entered Raleigh; and here, on April\r\n26, Johnston’s army surrendered on the same terms given by Grant.\r\n\r\nDecember 31 and January 1 Fort Fisher was captured, and on January 12\r\nWilmington was entered by the Federals; February 18, Charleston was\r\ncaptured.\r\n\r\nThe regular battles during the Civil War numbered 892. Lincoln called\r\nin all for 2,690,000 men. There were actually in service 1,490,000.\r\nThere were 400,000 disabled; 304,369 perished; 220,000 were captured,\r\nand 26,000 died in captivity. The expenses of the war were $3,500,000\r\nper day. The national debt was $2,700,000,000.\r\n\r\nThis great American War was fought on both sides with a courage\r\nand fortitude never before experienced in the annals of warfare.\r\nAs compared with the statements of forces and losses in battles of\r\nEuropean armies, the casualties in the battles of the Civil War were\r\nthree and four times as great. And this proves that in the American War\r\neach side met “foe-men worthy of their steel.” These overwhelmingly\r\nfearful casualties are not to be explained otherwise. And each\r\nsection respects the other more than before the war—a war in which\r\nthe conquered felt not, nor said, _peccavi_, and in which surrender\r\nto greater numbers and heavier artillery involved no sacrifice of\r\nbelief in the truth and justice of their cause. Was there ever an\r\narmed strife that brought forth greater generals or more knightly\r\nvalor, undiminished courage and unflinching fortitude on the part\r\nof combatants? Together must the names of Grant and Lee go down to\r\nposterity as great types of the American soldier,—the one, noble and\r\ngenerous in victory; the other, though a hero uncrowned by success, a\r\nwarrior still more heroic in defeat.\r\n\r\nTHE SPANISH-AMERICAN WAR.—The proximate causes of the war with\r\nSpain are tersely set forth in the Joint Resolution declaring\r\nthe independence of Cuba and demanding the withdrawal of Spanish\r\nsovereignty therefrom, which says:—\r\n\r\n“_Whereas_, The abhorrent conditions which have existed for more than\r\nthree years in the island of Cuba, so near our own borders, have\r\nshocked the moral sense of the people of the United States, have been\r\na disgrace to Christian civilization, culminating as they have in the\r\ndestruction of a United States’ battleship, with 266 of its officers\r\nand crew, while on a friendly visit in the harbor of Havana, and cannot\r\nlonger be endured, as has been set forth by the President of the United\r\nStates in his message to Congress of April 11, 1898, upon which the\r\naction of Congress was invited; therefore,\r\n\r\n“_Resolved_, by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates of America in Congress assembled:\r\n\r\n“_First_, That the people of the island of Cuba are, and of right ought\r\nto be, free and independent.\r\n\r\n“_Second_, That it is the duty of the United States to demand, and the\r\nGovernment of the United States does hereby demand, that the Government\r\nof Spain at once relinquish its authority and government in the island\r\nof Cuba, and withdraw its land and naval forces from Cuba and Cuban\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\n“_Third_, That the President of the United States be, and he hereby is,\r\ndirected and empowered to use the entire land and naval forces of the\r\nUnited States, and to call into the actual service of the United States\r\nthe militia of the several States to such extent as may be necessary to\r\ncarry these resolutions into effect.\r\n\r\n“_Fourth_, That the United States hereby disclaims any disposition\r\nor intention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction, or control over\r\nsaid Island, except for the pacification thereof, and asserts its\r\ndetermination when that is completed to leave the government and\r\ncontrol of the Island to its people.”\r\n\r\nThis resolution was signed by the President at 11.24 o’clock A. M.,\r\nApril 20, 1898.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MORRO CASTLE, SANTIAGO, CUBA.]\r\n\r\nIt was on February 15, 1898, that the catastrophe referred to—the\r\nblowing up of the Maine—occurred. On April 25, the formal declaration\r\nof war was made.\r\n\r\nSpain had three fleets,—Admiral Cervera’s flying squadron, the Asiatic\r\nfleet under Admiral Montejo, and Admiral Camara’s fleet of heavy\r\narmored vessels.\r\n\r\nThe American navy is always ready for emergencies, and even with the\r\ngrudging appropriations made by Congress, the “new navy,” while not\r\npossessing vessels of such large size as those of some other nations,\r\nwas much more formidable than was generally supposed. Congress,\r\napprehending the outcome, had given the President $50,000,000 to\r\nput the country on a war footing. In reply to the call for 125,000\r\nvolunteers, five times that number offered themselves.\r\n\r\nIt had been more than fifty years since the United States had\r\nencountered a foreign foe, and since the close of the Civil War, for a\r\nthird of a century, peace had reigned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ADMIRAL GEORGE DEWEY.]\r\n\r\nApril 25, by cable to Hong Kong, Commodore Dewey was ordered to find\r\nand destroy the Spanish Asiatic fleet, which he proceeded to do on May\r\n1st, without the loss of a single man. Entering Manila Bay, scorning\r\ntorpedoes and mines, his wonderful battle at Cavite is the admiration\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nSchley, with his flying squadron, watched in Hampton Roads for an\r\nattack by the enemy on the Atlantic coast. Havana was blockaded by\r\nSampson’s squadron April 22, and his searchlights seen from the Cuban\r\ncapital were as the handwriting on the sky, foredooming Spanish rule.\r\nHis tactics were to take no risk with his vessels while awaiting the\r\nappearance of the Spanish ships, so he failed to return the greeting of\r\nthe shore batteries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAIN DECK OF CRUISER CHICAGO.]\r\n\r\nThe first casualties of the war were in Cardenas harbor May 11, when\r\nupon the Winslow, while chasing a decoy gunboat too far under the fire\r\nof the land batteries, Ensign Bagley and four sailors were the first\r\nmen of the navy to lay down their lives.\r\n\r\nIt was known that Cervera had sailed from Cadiz toward the West\r\nIndies. Sampson made a tour of Porto Rico to hunt the Spaniard, who\r\nmysteriously eluded the sight of the Americans. San Juan was bombarded\r\non May 12. On May 30 Schley, who in the meantime had arrived off\r\nSantiago, dispatched: “I have seen the enemy’s ships with my own eyes.”\r\nCervera had then been in the harbor ten days. On the 31st, Schley\r\ncommenced a bombardment, and the forts at the mouth of Santiago harbor\r\nand the vessels within replied for an hour. June 1 Sampson came, and\r\nall hope of escape for Cervera was cut off. On that night Lieutenant\r\nHobson executed his bold, heroic plan of sinking the Merrimac in the\r\nchannel of the harbor, which was accomplished without the loss of one\r\nof his seven co-heroes, although subjected to a deadly fire from forts\r\nand vessels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DEWEY’S GUNS AT MANILA.]\r\n\r\nThe first troops landed on Cuban soil were the marines, 650 in number,\r\nunder Lieutenant-Colonel Huntington. This battalion had been on board\r\nthe Panther since May 22, and the men were eager to land. After Sampson\r\nhad shelled the shore and adjacent hills and woods, on the afternoon of\r\nJune 10 the landing was made and the American flag raised for the first\r\ntime on Spanish territory in the west. No Spaniards were seen until\r\nafter the tents had been erected and the evening shadows were falling.\r\nThen for five nights and days there was no sleep for these men, than\r\nwhom there were no greater heroes in this short, sharp war. With few\r\nexceptions they received their “baptism of fire,” and nobly did they\r\nacquit themselves.\r\n\r\nI am told that when almost utterly exhausted the first platoon reached\r\nthe summit of Cusco hill, so exactly in unison was their fire that the\r\nSpanish, believing that machine guns were opening upon them, turned\r\nand ran, never again making a stand. The first to consecrate the soil\r\nwith his life’s blood was Dr. John Blair Gibbs, who left a $10,000\r\npractice in New York to go as surgeon of the battalion, and who had\r\ngreatly endeared himself to both officers and men. Sergeant Goode, one\r\nof the finest subalterns in the corps, and four men were killed. The\r\ngood condition and health of this battalion during the whole campaign\r\nwere due to the fine organization of the commissariat and the strict\r\ndiscipline maintained in this corps.\r\n\r\nGeneral Shafter arrived off Santiago, June 20, with a force of 773\r\nofficers and 14,564 men. General Garcia, the Cuban commander, with four\r\nthousand insurgents, was at Assuadero, eighteen miles west. There he,\r\nShafter, and Sampson held a consultation. On the 22d, the disembarkment\r\nof troops was begun. On the morning of the 23d, General Lawton with\r\nhis division advanced to Juragua. Major-General Wheeler, after landing\r\n964 of his force, pursuant to General Shafter’s orders, moved rapidly\r\nto the front, and, passing through Lawton’s lines, pushed on to Las\r\nGuasimas, attacking and defeating General Linares on the morning of\r\nJune 24.\r\n\r\nThe entire American force was pressed forward under General Wheeler,\r\nGeneral Shafter being detained on the ships to attend to the landing\r\nof the armament and supplies. On the 29th, the commanding general left\r\nhis ships and pitched his camp on the Santiago road, and on the next\r\nday orders were given for an attack along the whole line. In carrying\r\nout these orders, General Lawton with about six thousand men attacked\r\nEl Caney, a small town about five miles north of Santiago. The garrison\r\nconsisted of 520 men, the defenses being one block-house and a shore\r\nfortification. It was not until four o’clock that General Lawton’s\r\nsuccess was complete. His loss was 437 killed and wounded, and but 30\r\nof the enemy succeeded in escaping and reaching the Spanish lines.\r\nWhile Lawton was moving on El Caney, the cavalry division, unmounted,\r\nand Kent’s infantry division were ordered to move forward. Crossing\r\nSan Juan River at a point about five hundred yards from the enemy’s\r\nfortifications on San Juan ridge, the left of the cavalry rested on\r\nthe main Santiago road and the infantry formed to the left of the\r\ncavalry. These troops were subjected to a very heavy fire in advancing\r\nfrom El Pozo, in crossing the river and in forming on the other side;\r\nthey, however, most bravely charged the enemy in their strong position\r\non Kettle Hill and San Juan ridge, and drove them precipitately from\r\ntheir strong fortifications; the American loss being 154 killed and\r\n997 wounded. This placed the Americans in a position commanding the\r\nfortifications around the city of Santiago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL JOSEPH WHEELER.\r\n\r\n(Copyright by Aimé Dupont, 1899.)]\r\n\r\nThe Spanish fleet, consisting of five armored cruisers of 7,000 tons\r\nand 2 torpedo-boat destroyers, attempted to escape from Santiago at\r\n9.30 o’clock on Sunday morning, July 3, just nine weeks after the\r\ndestruction of Montejo’s fleet. Schley and Sampson destroyed the\r\nvessels and made prisoners of 70 officers and 1600 men; 350 were killed\r\nand 160 wounded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TRUCE BEFORE SANTIAGO.]\r\n\r\nFighting more or less severe occurred until the 10th, when negotiations\r\nfor surrender were inaugurated, resulting in the capitulation of\r\nSantiago, July 16, the Spanish fortifications, twenty-four thousand\r\nprisoners, and a large amount of arms and ammunition. At noon on\r\nSunday, July 17, 1898, the American flag was hoisted over the\r\nheadquarters at Santiago.\r\n\r\nGeneral Miles started on the invasion of Porto Rico, July 25, and\r\nreached Guanica at daylight next morning. He landed with three thousand\r\nfive hundred men, marched toward Yauco, five miles distant, which he\r\nentered after a skirmish, and was received enthusiastically by the\r\ncitizens, as he also was at Ponce, where he was joined by General\r\nWilson, who had come with the war ships, and who was made governor. The\r\narmy continued on to San Juan along the military road, meeting very\r\nlittle opposition.\r\n\r\nJuly 26, the French ambassador, M. Jules Cambon, acting for Spain, made\r\novertures for peace. The protocol was signed on April 21, by M. Cambon\r\nand Secretary of State Day. A cessation of hostilities was proclaimed.\r\nAt the very moment of the signing of the protocol, the last naval\r\nbattle took place at Manzanilla, Cuba, and an artillery engagement at\r\nAybonito in Porto Rico.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AGUINALDO, THE TAGAL LEADER.]\r\n\r\nThe one-hundred-days Spanish-American war was concluded by the treaty\r\nof Paris.\r\n\r\nIt will be only in the retrospect that we may tell the results of\r\nthis conflict. As the future unfolds them to our view, it may be that\r\nit will have been more momentous in its consequences than we can now\r\ndetermine. One thing it has proved, that is, that this nation is really\r\n_reunited_; for, from all sections and from all grades of life, men\r\nflocked together to fight and conquer under the old Stars and Stripes.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. FOREIGN WARS.\r\n\r\nNAPOLEONIC WARS.—The long contest between France and Austria began\r\nwhen the Girondist ministry of France declared war, April 20, 1792. By\r\nthe execution of Louis XVI., January 21, 1793, the Revolution threw\r\ndown the gauntlet to all ancient Europe. England, whose sympathies\r\nhad hitherto been more or less with France, began to take measures to\r\nbring about more cordial relations with the other powers of Europe.\r\nSpain, Portugal, Austria, Prussia, and Russia, for the time seemed to\r\nforget their several grievances as they found themselves confronted\r\nwith a totally new move on the chessboard of European autonomy. The\r\nyear 1794 saw the French Revolution progressing triumphantly, and all\r\nEurope, except England and Austria, appeared acquiescent in apathetic\r\nindifference. In 1795 the royalists made a supreme effort to recover\r\npower, but were crushed by the “Man of Destiny,” and the Directory,\r\nconsisting of five members, of whom Carnot was one, came into power.\r\nDominated by the martial genius of Carnot, “the organizer of victory,”\r\nthe Directory won the confidence of the army. Scherer, the commander,\r\nlacked the qualifications to undertake a successful campaign against\r\nAustria, and Bonaparte, succeeding him, soon infused his own spirit\r\ninto the army and bound it to himself with a devotion that never failed.\r\n\r\nEarly in the year 1800, Napoleon, having been made first consul, took\r\nup his abode in the old palace of the kings of France, the Tuileries.\r\nThe history of Napoleon for the ensuing fifteen years is the history\r\nof Europe. It is, therefore, best to begin with the close of the\r\neighteenth century, in order to appreciate the situation at the dawn of\r\nthe nineteenth.\r\n\r\nAustria and England, with several small German principalities, were\r\nstill in arms against France. The plans and movements of the armies\r\nunder Napoleon showed him to be verily a master in military skill.\r\nOpening this campaign, he left Massena with about eight thousand\r\nsoldiers to hold the territory from Nice to Genoa, so as to keep the\r\nAustrian army in Italy busy. He sent the Rhine army, under Moreau, to\r\nthreaten Bavaria and to secure the most important position between the\r\nRhine and the Danube. Moreau drove the Austrians to Ulm, and disposed\r\nhis left flank to support Napoleon. Meantime, he himself was recruiting\r\nanother army for operations on the Po. Baron de Melas, commanding the\r\nAustrian troops in Northern Italy, besieged Massena in Genoa, which,\r\nafter severe suffering, surrendered, leaving De Melas free to join the\r\narmy of the Po. Napoleon was between de Melas and Austria. General Ott,\r\nwith eighteen thousand men, attempted to reach Placentia, but Lannes,\r\nwith twelve thousand, defeated him at Montebello, forcing him back to\r\nAllesandria. Napoleon hastened across the Po to Stradella to intercept\r\nDe Melas and prevent his breaking through the French lines to Placentia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NAPOLEON, 1814. (MEISSONIER.)]\r\n\r\nThe night of June 13, 1800, the French army was scattered, watching\r\nalong the Po and the Tessino for the Austrians, while their army, forty\r\nthousand strong, with ten thousand more not far distant, was ready at\r\ndaybreak of the 14th to cut its way through the armies of France, and\r\nreach Placentia. The French force was but eighteen thousand, but Victor\r\nwith his division held his position firmly, and the great leader,\r\nKellerman, was in command of the cavalry. Backward and forward surged\r\nthe battle with varying fortune, and at noon victory seemed perched\r\nupon the banners of Austria. De Melas was so certain that the battle\r\nwas won that he galloped back to Allesandria and sent dispatches to\r\nthat effect to the governments of Europe. General de Zach was left\r\nin command to conduct the pursuit and to drive the French across the\r\nScrivia. Napoleon, dismayed, hoping against hope that Desaix, whom he\r\nhad sent towards Novi the day before to look out in that quarter for\r\nDe Melas, might hear the thunders of the battle and return, saw him\r\nin the distance, hurrying with his troops, who, though worn and tired,\r\nwere eager for the fight, and Napoleon saw already the tide of battle\r\nturned.\r\n\r\nDesaix had found no trace of the Austrians, but he had heard the sound\r\nof battle at day dawn, and he knew that De Melas was there, and that\r\nthere he was needed, and not at Novi. He roused his division, and\r\nhastened back to Napoleon. A short conference with his chief, to whose\r\nquestioning he answered, “The battle is lost, but it is only three\r\no’clock, there is yet time to win another,” and the battle of Marengo,\r\nglorious in its consequences to Napoleon, stupendous in its carnage,\r\nwas won; but Desaix, the brave paladin, lay dead upon the field. De\r\nMelas returned from Allesandria to meet the victorious army he had\r\nleft—flying in disorder—thoroughly routed. On December 2, Moreau and\r\nNey won the field of Hohenlinden, and the “peace of Luneville” was\r\nconcluded, February 9, 1801.\r\n\r\nThe result of this campaign was the cession of Austria’s strongholds in\r\nthe Tyrol and Bavaria to France, as also a number of important holdings\r\nin Italy. France secured the left bank of the Rhine, the Belgian\r\nprovinces and Tuscany, and the king of Naples closed his harbors to\r\nEngland. In March, 1802, by the “treaty of Amiens,” peace was concluded\r\nwith England.\r\n\r\nThe coalition of Denmark, Sweden, Russia, and Prussia, with France\r\nagainst England, in 1800, fomented by Napoleon, broke down in 1801,\r\nafter Nelson’s battle of Copenhagen.\r\n\r\nEngland had secured the supremacy of the sea and dominion over India,\r\nrescued Portugal, Naples, and the States of the Church from France, and\r\nrestored the Sublime Porte to Turkey. Finding Napoleon again militating\r\nagainst her interests, and resenting his encroachments, England\r\ndeclared war against France in the spring of 1803. Russia espoused the\r\ncause of England, Prussia held off, and Austria was friendly, though\r\nnot in fighting trim. The third coalition comprised England, Russia,\r\nand Austria.\r\n\r\nPowerless to hurt England on the seas, Napoleon, who had the year\r\nprevious been proclaimed emperor, attacked Austria, invaded her\r\nterritory, captured her army at Ulm, proceeded to Vienna, and occupied\r\na great part of the valley of the Danube. On December 2, 1805, the\r\n“Battle of the Three Emperors” (the battle of Austerlitz) was fought.\r\nThe “Peace of Pressburg,” concluded December 26, left Austria shorn of\r\nher ancient prestige, her title of German Empire, and of a great part\r\nof her possessions. The “Sun of Austerlitz” melted the third coalition.\r\nIn the meantime the battle of Trafalgar, won by the immortal Nelson,\r\ncrushed the naval power of both France and Spain.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1806, Prussia declared war against France, and, to the\r\namazement of Europe, alone undertook to engage armies flushed from\r\ntheir recent victories and still in Germany. October 14, Napoleon\r\nutterly defeated the Prussians at Jena and Auerstadt, and entered\r\nBerlin a conquerer, the king having fled to Königsberg. Russia came\r\nto the aid of Prussia, but arrived too late to accomplish anything\r\nexcept to check the advance of the French, whose armies wintered on the\r\nVistula. The next summer, however, the Russians met their final defeat\r\nin this campaign at Friedland, and Königsberg was taken. The “Treaty of\r\nTilsit” ended the operations of this fourth coalition July 7, 1807.\r\n\r\nThe fifth coalition against Napoleon comprised England, Austria, Spain,\r\nand Portugal. The decisive battle of this campaign was at Wagram, July\r\n5 and 6, 1809, and terrible as were the consequences of his defeat\r\nto Austria, so crippled was Napoleon that he willingly granted the\r\narmistice of Znaim and concluded the “Peace of Vienna.” When the fifth\r\ncoalition ended, Napoleon had acquired the Illyrian provinces and part\r\nof the Tyrol for France, and eventually the Emperor’s daughter, Maria\r\nLouisa, for his wife.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ADMIRAL HORATIO NELSON.]\r\n\r\nIn 1812 came war with Russia, and that most disastrous campaign which\r\ncost France more than three hundred thousand soldiers and Napoleon\r\nhis empire. Russia, England, Prussia, and Sweden formed the coalition\r\nnow, and Turkey had made peace with Russia. Napoleon crossed the\r\nNiemen in June, halted at Wilna to put his new conscripts in better\r\norder, addressed words of sympathy to Poland, and took measures to\r\nkeep Austria conciliated. The Russians retreated before him. He met\r\nand fought and defeated them at Smolensk, August 17; they retreated in\r\ngood order, burning and destroying all in their reach. The terrible\r\nbattle of Borodino was fought September 7; the defeated Russians again\r\nretreated in good order, pursuing the same tactics. Napoleon reached\r\nMoscow September 15, but the heroic measure of Russia in destroying\r\nthat city was equal in its results to several victories. October 15,\r\nthe French troops commenced their fearful retreat. The Russian armies\r\ngrew bold, they harassed the French troops, weak from hunger and cold,\r\nand from Moscow to Wilna their progress was one continual guerilla\r\nwarfare. From Wilna, their flight to France, December 5, was even more\r\ndisastrous. Of the grand army that set out in the spring not one fourth\r\never returned.\r\n\r\nAffairs in Spain had fared badly for France. Wellington defeated the\r\nFrench army in Spain, and finally expelled it. France, though sometimes\r\nshaken in her devotion by the conscription that was draining her\r\nchildren’s blood, still had faith in Napoleon, and in 1813, having\r\nraised another grand army, he undertook to subjugate Prussia. His\r\nfirst victory was on the plain of Lutzen. The Prussians and Russians\r\nretreated in good order through Dresden. Napoleon pursued and drove\r\nthem from Bauken, on May 20 and 21, and established his headquarters at\r\nDresden. Austria now joined the allies. In their attack upon Dresden,\r\nAugust 26 and 27, they were defeated, but Russian troops and the King\r\nof Bavaria coming up made Napoleon’s position untenable. The allies\r\nwere awaiting him at Leipsic. The battle raged for three days, and\r\nNapoleon withdrew on October 19, utterly defeated.\r\n\r\nJanuary 23, 1814, Napoleon, having raised another army, left Paris to\r\nassume command. The allies—England, Austria, Prussia, and Russia—were\r\nmore determined than ever to crush him. Many battles were fought, and\r\nthe fortunes of war varied. Blucher defeated him at La Pothiers on the\r\n1st of February. Napoleon was the victor at Montenau; unsuccessful at\r\nSoissons, March 3; victorious at Cravonne, March 7; and defeated by\r\nBlucher at Laon, March 9. With more than half his army lost, Napoleon\r\nworried the allies in their rear; but Blucher marched on Paris. The\r\nprestige of Napoleon and France in Europe was at an end.\r\n\r\nThe Empress and the regency retired to Blois. On March 31 Paris\r\nsurrendered, and the Emperor of Russia and the King of Prussia entered\r\nthe city. A provisional government, with Talleyrand at its head,\r\ndeposed Napoleon on April 2, and on April 6 he abdicated. May 30, the\r\nFirst Peace of Paris was concluded between France and the allies.\r\nFrance was to have her boundaries as they were in 1792, and also her\r\nforeign possessions, except Tobago, St. Lucia, and Mauritius, which,\r\nwith Malta, were ceded to England. The Bourbons, in the person of Louis\r\nXVIII., were restored; but the French people were not content, so that\r\nwhen Napoleon appeared at Cannes on March 1, 1815, he was greeted with\r\njoy, even by the troops sent out to oppose him. This astonishing news\r\nwas communicated to the Congress of the Allies assembled at Vienna. The\r\nallied armies at once gathered on the borders of France, Wellington\r\nlanded in Flanders, and Blucher’s Prussians joined him. Wellington,\r\nfinding Napoleon in front of him, fell back to Waterloo, lest the\r\napproach of the Prussians should be cut off. Napoleon hurled his force\r\non Blucher at Fluores, and victoriously drove him from the field on the\r\n15th. Ney, who had been sent to confront Wellington, fought at Quatre\r\nBras, and the following day joined Napoleon. On the 18th of June, 1815,\r\nNapoleon made his supreme and final effort to recuperate his lost\r\nfortunes and to reestablish his empire.\r\n\r\nThe story of the battle of Waterloo, than which none ever fought was\r\nmore decisive in its consequences, has been told and retold. The battle\r\nwas at first undecided, victory seeming to incline to Napoleon, though\r\nthe English and Germans with unflinching heroism still held the field\r\nuntil the afternoon, when Blucher, with his Prussians, at last arrived.\r\nNapoleon perceived that the supreme moment was at hand, and that his\r\nonly hope was to crush Wellington before Blucher’s advancing columns\r\ncould be thrown into line of battle. He sent forward his magnificent\r\nImperial Guard. They charged with chivalric splendor, fought with\r\nheroic desperation, were repulsed,—and the star of Napoleon set to\r\nrise no more.\r\n\r\nFinding his cause irretrievably lost, leaving the remnant of his\r\narmy in command of Marshal Soult, Napoleon fled and, failing to find\r\na passage to America, surrendered. This battle, magnificent in its\r\nresults, ensured to England a long peace, and raised her to the first\r\nrank, for military prowess, among the nations of the world.\r\n\r\nNapoleon’s skill at Waterloo was up to the highest standard of his most\r\nglorious work; but he was overwhelmed by preponderance in numbers. His\r\nentire force with which he conducted this campaign was barely 104,000,\r\nwhile the combined armies of Wellington and Blucher numbered 220,000.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NAPOLEON’S RETREAT FROM WATERLOO.]\r\n\r\nThe Congress of Vienna restored the _ancien régime_, replacing\r\ndethroned monarchs upon their hereditary domains, but the parceling\r\nout of the smaller territories showed the Powers to be quite as\r\narbitrary as Napoleon himself. The semi-decade of passive submission\r\nto the “policies of princes” was broken in 1820 by general revolts in\r\nEurope. Spanish-American colonies, indignant at French interference in\r\nSpanish matters, began their struggles for independence.\r\n\r\nGREEK WAR FOR INDEPENDENCE.—Since the capture of Constantinople by the\r\nTurks, in 1453, Greece had been subject to Turkey. Out of the defeats\r\nof several rebellions against the greed, tyranny, and brutality of the\r\nMoslem,—particularly from the revolutions of 1770 and 1790,—grew the\r\nsecret society of the Hetæria, cementing the union of the Greeks for\r\nthe struggle beginning in 1821. It is claimed that ten thousand Greeks\r\nwere slaughtered within a few days, and thirty thousand in less than\r\nthree months.\r\n\r\nMahmoud, having failed in 1825 to crush the rebellion, called Mehemet\r\nAli, the Pasha of Egypt, to his aid. Mehemet sent Ibrahim, his son,\r\nwith his army and navy, trained in the tactics of European warfare,\r\ninto the Peloponnesus. Victory and devastation marked his course. Never\r\nwas grander courage nor loftier bravery displayed than by the Greeks.\r\nThe siege of Missolonghi lasted from April 27, 1825, until April 22,\r\n1826. Athens was captured, June 2, 1827. The fleets of England, France,\r\nand Russia were cruising on the coasts to prevent attacks by the Turks\r\non the islands. Approaching the bay of Navarino, they were attacked\r\nby the Turks and Egyptians, whose combined fleets were thereupon\r\nannihilated on October 20, 1827. The Sultan was forced by the powers to\r\nconsent to the establishment of the kingdom of Greece, and his delay\r\nto do so was punished by Czar Nicholas, who declared war, crossed the\r\nBalkans, and at Adrianople in 1829 compelled the Sultan to recognize\r\nher independence, grant Christian governors to Servia, Moldavia, and\r\nWallachia, and to yield Bessarabia to Russia.\r\n\r\nMINOR EUROPEAN WARS.—The French Revolution of 1830, placing Louis\r\nPhilippe on the throne of France, brought about Belgium’s independence.\r\n\r\nThe Polish insurrection of 1831–32 lost Poland her last vestige of\r\nliberty, enchaining her irretrievably under the tyranny of Russia.\r\n\r\nFrom 1840 to 1852 England was engaged in quelling periodic wars in her\r\nIndian possessions. In 1841, her army, numbering seventeen thousand\r\nmen, perished in their retreat from Afghanistan. So with France in\r\nAlgiers and Morocco. And revolts in Spain were more or less successful.\r\n\r\nIn 1842, England’s war with China, caused by seizure of opium, resulted\r\nin the cession by China of Hong Kong, the freedom of five other ports,\r\nand $21,000,000 indemnity.\r\n\r\nIn 1848, the revolutionary spirit broke out fiercely, and the people\r\nmade strong leaps for liberty and constitutional government. In\r\nFrance, it overthrew Louis Philippe, establishing a republic, with\r\nLouis Napoleon President. In all Europe its echo resounded. Riots in\r\nVienna forced Metternich to flee to England; Ferdinand, to take refuge\r\nin the Tyrol and to abdicate in favor of his son, Francis Joseph.\r\nFrederick William was compelled by the conditions in Berlin to promise\r\na constitution. The Frankfort Assembly, in 1849, offered Frederick\r\nWilliam the title and prerogative of Emperor of Germany, and though,\r\nbecause of his respect for the Hapsburgs, he declined the honor, he\r\nstill took advantage of the sentiment that prompted the offer to so\r\nstrengthen the dynasty that later it might be held.\r\n\r\nHungary rose against Austria in 1848, and almost won independence.\r\nKossuth proclaimed Hungary a republic, and Nicholas immediately sent\r\naid to Austria. The Russian army, 130,000 strong, joined the Austrians.\r\nThe Hungarians retreated to Temesvar, where they were defeated with\r\ngreat slaughter, and Georgy surrendered, August 9, 1849. The name of\r\nHaynau, the Austrian commander, is held in execration for his awful\r\ncruelty to the conquered.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Italy rose. Lombardy drove out the Austrians. Charles\r\nAlbert, king of Sardinia, had declared war on Austria and crossed the\r\nMincio, April 8, 1848. Radetsky, commanding the Austrians, lost Gorto\r\nand yielded Peschiera in May, but in June he forced the Papal troops,\r\nwho were assisting Charles Albert, to surrender, and completely routed\r\nthe Italians at Custozza, July 25, and entered Milan. Charles Albert\r\nwas again defeated by Radetsky at Novari, March 23, 1849, and Venice\r\nwas captured August 23. Charles Albert resigned his crown to his son,\r\nVictor Emmanuel, and died shortly after.\r\n\r\nPope Pius IX. was forced to flee from Rome. Mazzini established the\r\nRoman republic in November. Austria, by the close of the summer of\r\n1849, had regained control of her disputed possessions. Louis Napoleon,\r\ntaking part against Italy, occupied Rome with his troops, July 2, 1849,\r\nand drove out Mazzini and Garibaldi.\r\n\r\nTHE CRIMEAN WAR.—In 1853, Louis Napoleon wanted war. He fomented\r\ntrouble between the Porte and Nicholas, which ended by a declaration\r\nof war by Russia. The Czar claimed and demanded the protectorate of\r\nChristians in Turkey. Austria, France, and England opposed the demand.\r\nNicholas had intimated to the British minister at St. Petersburg that\r\nEngland and Russia should share the partition of Turkey,—showing that\r\nhe was ready to carry out the will and aims of Peter the Great and\r\nCatherine. The Russian army was thrown across the Pruth into Moldavia,\r\nand was at first worsted by the Turks. In deference to the wishes of\r\nAustria and Prussia, Nicholas withdrew his army from the Danubian\r\nprovinces, and so secured their neutrality. He dislodged the Turkish\r\nfleet at Sinope, November 4, 1853.\r\n\r\nEngland and France allied with Turkey and declared war against Russia,\r\nMarch 28, 1854. The allied fleets and troops proceeded to the Black\r\nSea. Sebastopol was the great arsenal of Russia. Twenty-seven thousand\r\nEnglish, thirty thousand French, and seven thousand Turks were landed\r\nin the Bay of Eupatoria, thirty miles above Sebastopol, September 14,\r\n1854, towards which, five days later, the southerly march began. The\r\nallies waded the river Alma under terrific fire from the large Russian\r\narmy, and won a brilliant victory. The attack was remarkable in that it\r\nwon victory over superior numbers in seemingly impregnable positions,\r\nand in spite of official blunders. Mentschikoff, the Russian general,\r\nwithdrew the crews from the ships in the harbor and put them, eighteen\r\nthousand strong, in command of the batteries. With his own army he\r\nmarched out of Sebastopol, leaving twenty-five thousand defenders\r\nto the city. Admiral Korniloff and his able assistant, Colonel Von\r\nTodleben, undertook to strengthen the defenses and to inspire the\r\ntroops. On October 17, the siege guns of the allies were in position.\r\nThe English stormed the suburbs of the city, the Malakoff and the\r\nRedan; the French stormed the city. Both were unsuccessful. Russian\r\ntroops poured into Sebastopol, and invited battle outside of the\r\nfortifications. At the harbor of Balaklava, Turkish troops recoiled\r\nfrom the Russian advance, and Sir Colin Campbell, with the Highland\r\nBrigade, saved the shipping and stores by timely check to the Russians.\r\nThe battle of Balaklava, October 25, gave the town to the British after\r\nstubborn fighting, more than two thirds of the Light Brigade having\r\nbeen sacrificed to Lord Lucan’s misconstruction of orders.\r\n\r\nAt Inkerman, on November 5, sixty thousand Russians, in fog and rain,\r\nsurprised the British Household Guards, and for six hours vainly strove\r\nto crush them. General Bosquet, with the genius of the soldier, guessed\r\nthe point of severest attack, and sent reinforcements to the Guards.\r\nThe Russians were finally driven back. Little good resulted from these\r\ntwo stubborn battles. Winter put an end to active operations. Rain,\r\nhurricanes, insufficient shelter, lack of supplies, and extreme cold\r\nproduced fearful misery among the soldiers. Russia suffered as severely\r\nas did the allies, besides having had her fleet on the Black Sea\r\ndestroyed and her army beaten.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1855, the bombardment began again. In May the allies\r\ncaptured Kertch and Yenikale, thus cutting off Russian supplies\r\nfrom the Caucasian provinces. In June, Marshal Pelissier succeeded\r\nCanrobert and successfully stormed Manelon; and, after the abortive\r\nattacks, June 18, of the French on the Malakoff and the English on the\r\nRedan, General Simpson succeeded Lord Raglan. August 16, the Russians\r\ncrossed Tchernaya, but were repulsed by the French. On September 8\r\nthe French carried the Malakoff; the British failed to carry the\r\nRedan. The Russians set fire to the city and ships and retired to\r\nthe northern part of the harbor, where they held strongly intrenched\r\npositions opposite the allied armies and beyond the reach of the allied\r\nfleets. Russia was driven from the Black Sea, had lost her prestige\r\nin the Baltic Sea, Bomarsund, on the Aland islands, and the arsenal\r\nof Sweaborg, in the Gulf of Finland. She had saved Cronstadt, and,\r\nat terrible sacrifice, had captured Kars from the English General\r\nWilliams with his army of Turks. Her vast territory was comparatively\r\nintact. The nations were not satisfied. The Peace of Paris increased\r\nthe prestige of Louis Napoleon; it postponed the Eastern Question by\r\nputting the Christian subjects under the nominal protection of the\r\nPowers, but virtually under that of the Sultan. The treaty of peace was\r\nsigned March 30, 1856.\r\n\r\nWARS IN THE EAST.—In 1857, the Indian Mutiny was caused by the\r\nintroduction of Enfield rifles. Delhi was taken after desperate\r\nfighting, September 20. Cawnpore and Lucknow were the theatre of\r\nhorrible scenes. The rebellion was finally crushed in 1859.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime war with Persia was begun and ended by the recapture\r\nof Herat, in Afghanistan. In December, 1857, England and France made\r\nwar on China and captured Canton. They secured many concessions by the\r\nTreaty of Tien Tsin, and $2,000,000 indemnity.\r\n\r\nWAR BETWEEN AUSTRIA, FRANCE, AND SARDINIA.—In 1859, Louis Napoleon\r\nmade a secret alliance with Italy. General disarmament was proposed.\r\nSardinia agreed to it; Austria stood aloof. On April 25, 1859, Austria\r\nordered the disarmament of Piedmont. On the 27th, King Victor\r\nEmmanuel proclaimed war. On the 30th, French troops were in Turin. On\r\nMay 13, Louis Napoleon himself disembarked at Genoa, where he was met\r\nby Victor Emmanuel. The Austrian forces crossed the Ticino, _en route_\r\nfor Milan, but hesitated, because of the French advance. The opening\r\nbattles at Montebello and Balestro, May 20, 30, and 31, were favorable\r\nto the allies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAPTURE OF THE MALAKOFF.]\r\n\r\nAt Magenta, June 4, the Austrians met with terrible defeat. The forces\r\nof the allies numbered 55,000, and their loss was 4000; the Austrian\r\narmy of 75,000 lost 10,000 killed and wounded and 7000 prisoners.\r\nThe conquerors entered Milan on June 8. Francis Joseph fell back to\r\nthe line of the Mincio, and at Solferino the decisive battle of the\r\ncampaign was fought on June 24. Napoleon commanded the allied armies,\r\nwhich numbered about 150,000; they fought for sixteen hours against the\r\nAustrian force of 170,000, gaining a fearful victory. This battle cost\r\nAustria 20,000 men; the French lost in killed and wounded 12,000 and\r\nthe Sardinians 5000 men.\r\n\r\nThe allies crossed the Mincio and laid siege to Peschiera, but\r\nwhile all Europe expected another fight, an armistice of five weeks\r\nwas agreed to, and Napoleon, unknown to his ally, met Francis at\r\nVillafranca and made a peace, upon which was based the Treaty of\r\nZurich, signed November 10. Austria gave Lombardy to Napoleon for the\r\nking of Sardinia, as also the fortresses of Mantua and Peschiera. Italy\r\nwas to become a confederation, with the Pope as president, of which\r\nAustria was to be a member, because of her holdings in Venetia. Tuscany\r\nand Modena were to be restored to their princes. Garibaldi’s brilliant\r\nconquest of Sicily and Naples, in 1860, and Sardinia’s growing power,\r\nstartled Europe, but the nations dared not interfere. The general\r\nparliament of Italy met in 1861, at Turin, and made Victor Emmanuel\r\nking of Italy. Rome, under the Pope, and Venetia, under Austria, were\r\nas yet dismembered from “Young Italy.”\r\n\r\nWAR WITH DENMARK.—Christian IX. succeeded to the throne of Denmark\r\nNovember 15, 1863. He endeavored to incorporate Schleswig with Denmark;\r\nthe German population repudiated him and appealed to the Confederacy.\r\nThe Diet sent troops into Holstein. Bismarck induced Austria to join\r\nPrussia in setting aside the London treaty of 1853, and the allied\r\ntroops forced the Danes back to the intrenchments of Duppel. The\r\ncapture of Duppel by the Prussians, April 18, proved the efficiency of\r\nneedle guns and rifled cannon. June 22, the allies crossed the channel\r\nto the Island of Alsen and, on the 28th, captured the Danish stronghold\r\nDennewerke, hitherto considered impregnable. The Treaty of Vienna,\r\nOctober 30, 1864, closed the war. Prussia and Austria together were to\r\ncontrol the duchies.\r\n\r\nTHE SEVEN WEEKS’ WAR.—The arrangement between Prussia and Austria\r\nrespecting the Danish duchies caused the “Seven Weeks’ War” of 1866.\r\nBismarck induced Victor Emmanuel to form an alliance against Austria,\r\nMarch 27. The Prussians, on June 7, without a blow forced the Austrians\r\nto retire from Holstein, ignoring the protest of the Federal Diet.\r\nAustria was not prepared for war. Her army, together with that of\r\nSaxony, amounted to two hundred and seventy-one thousand. With Prussia,\r\nfully equipped and on a war footing with three armies, besides the\r\nreserves, the grand total estimated at three hundred thousand, the\r\nresult was a foregone conclusion. Prussia declared war, June 15, 1866,\r\nagainst Hanover, Hesse, and Saxony, and next day threw her armies\r\ninto the hostile states. On the 17th Francis Joseph published his\r\nwar manifesto. Italy declared war, on the 20th, against Austria and\r\nBavaria. In fourteen days Prussia’s immense army was mobilized. In five\r\ndays the northern states to the Main were disarmed, and the Saxon army\r\nwas forced to retreat toward Bohemia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BATTLE OF MAGENTA.]\r\n\r\nGeneral Benedek was commander of the Austrians. Upon news of Prussian\r\nvictories, he advised Francis Joseph to make terms of peace with\r\nWilliam. Prussia fought for German unification; Austria to protect\r\nher pride. It was supposed the Austrians would first enter Saxony and\r\ndispute the Prussian advance, but Bismarck had determined the war\r\nshould be brief, for Prussia was now master of the situation. On June\r\n23, the Prussian army marched from three points towards Josephstadt,\r\nwhere Benedek was preparing to fight. On the 27th the Austrians were\r\ndriven back at Soor, next day at Skalitz, and on the 29th at Gitschen.\r\nArchduke Leopold, on the 28th, and Count Clam Gallas, at Gitschen,\r\nboth attacked the enemy in disobedience of orders, and thus forced\r\nBenedek to fall back from his strongest position towards Königgratz.\r\nThe Austrians were also defeated, on the 28th, at Königinhof and\r\nSchweinschadel, and their loss by this time numbered over thirty-five\r\nthousand. Benedek asked permission to retreat into Moravia and await\r\nreinforcements, but news of the Austrian victory over the Italians\r\nat Custozza reached Vienna, and immediately battle was enjoined upon\r\nBenedek. Benedek placed five hundred guns in position, spanning a\r\nleague between the Elbe and Bistritz.\r\n\r\nOn July 2, the king of Prussia assumed command of the Prussian hosts\r\nand ordered attack for the next day. The Crown Prince, several miles\r\naway with his army, received orders at four o’clock in the morning\r\nof the 3d to advance his Silesian army from Königinhof. At eight\r\no’clock, Prince Frederick Charles, with a hundred thousand, attacked\r\nthe Austrian centre lying against Sadowa. General Herwarth, with four\r\nhundred thousand men, attacked the Austrian right. The whole Austrian\r\narmy was hurled against these two commands for five hours. Prince\r\nFrederick Charles forced passage through the Bistritz and took Sadowa,\r\nbut could not take the heights. At one o’clock retreat was being\r\nconsidered, but the Crown Prince coming up with his troops the heights\r\nwere taken at four o’clock. The fighting on both sides in this battle\r\nwas determined and heroic. The Prussian loss was over ten thousand,\r\nand the Austrians lost twenty-seven thousand killed and wounded,\r\nnineteen thousand prisoners, with 174 cannon and 11 colors. At Lissa,\r\non July 20, the Austrian navy destroyed the Italian fleet. July 22, an\r\narmistice of four weeks was granted. The Peace of Prague was concluded\r\nAugust 23. Her defeat cost Austria Venetia and the quadrilateral,\r\nnamely, the fortresses of Peschiera, Mantua, Verona, and Legnano,\r\ndeprived her of any part in Germany or German affairs, and Holstein and\r\nSchleswig, and obliged her to pay 40,000,000 thalers, one half of which\r\nshe was to retain in lieu of the duchies.\r\n\r\nAustria emerged from the “Seven Weeks’ War” with her ideas somewhat\r\nliberalized, and though her territory was diminished her progress and\r\nprosperity increased. The dual-Austro-Hungarian empire was formed\r\nby Francis Joseph, he ruling at Vienna as Emperor of Austria and\r\nat Buda Pesth as king of Hungary. This war also ended the Germanic\r\nconfederation of 1815, and the North German Confederation under Prussia\r\narose.\r\n\r\nAt the peace of Vienna, October 3, Austria recognized the kingdom\r\nof Italy, and with the acquisition of Venetia and the quadrilateral\r\nfortresses the “Seven Weeks’ War” had greatly helped on the cause of\r\n“United Italy.”\r\n\r\nIn April, 1864, Louis Napoleon sent an army of twenty-five thousand\r\nto sustain the Austrian Archduke Maximilian on the throne of Mexico.\r\nAt that time the United States was occupied with the Civil War. This\r\nended, Napoleon was summarily required to withdraw his forces from the\r\nAmerican continent, which he did. Maximilian was thus left to his fate,\r\nand, after being condemned by court martial, was shot at Querétaro,\r\nJune 19, 1867.\r\n\r\nTHE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.—Prince Leopold, of Hohenzollern, was offered\r\nthe throne of Spain after Isabella had fled from Madrid. Leopold\r\ndeclined, but Napoleon demanded that the Emperor William should\r\nguarantee never to permit Leopold to accept. William refused to accede\r\nto the demand, and Napoleon, urged by the war party, declared war\r\nJuly 19, 1870. On the same day the Confederation placed its forces\r\nin the hands of William, as did the South Germans. This spontaneous\r\nuprising of all Germany was unlooked for. Napoleon’s army numbered\r\nthree hundred and ten thousand men. In ten days William had nearly\r\nhalf a million soldiers ready to march against the enemy. August 2,\r\nthe first fight took place at Saarbrücken, a little town over the\r\nGerman frontier. Napoleon and the young Prince Imperial were present,\r\nand the force of Uhlans was driven back. August 4, the Crown Prince of\r\nPrussia drove the right wing of MacMahon’s army back at Weissenburg,\r\nand on the 6th, again was MacMahon defeated at Wörth. The Germans,\r\nhaving separated MacMahon’s army, advanced into Alsace. In the meantime\r\nGeneral Steinmetz carried Spicheren by storm, and the whole German army\r\nwent forward. Together with the Crown Prince, Steinmetz, on the 14th\r\nof August, defeated Marshal Bazaine, at Courcelles, who retreated to\r\nMetz, and then endeavored to push on with his hundred thousand men to\r\nChalons. Von Moltke hurried on the Crown Prince to intercept Bazaine,\r\nand at Mars la Tour was fought the fiercest battle, so far, of the war.\r\nOn either side the losses amounted to seventeen thousand. Gravelotte\r\nwas fought, on August 18, between the armies of Steinmetz and the\r\nCrown Prince, King William commanding in person. The battle lasted all\r\nday between two hundred thousand Germans and one hundred and eighty\r\nthousand French. The Germans lost twenty thousand men, and succeeded\r\nin forcing Bazaine into Metz. Although, in one sort, an undecisive\r\nbattle, Gravelotte perhaps settled the fate of the Empire. MacMahon’s\r\nplan was, with his one hundred and twenty-five thousand men reorganized\r\nat Chalons, to prevent the German advance on Paris. He was overruled\r\nand sent to the relief of Bazaine. Defeated in several small fights,\r\nMacMahon was obliged to fall back on Sedan. The heights and ridges\r\nabove Sedan once occupied by hostile troops, surrender or annihilation\r\nwas the outcome. MacMahon was wounded, then Ducrot, and the command\r\nfell to Wimpffen. Sedan was forced to surrender, September 1, and\r\nNapoleon himself gave his sword to King William. Paris was maddened.\r\nThe Empress escaped to England. Napoleon was taken to the castle of\r\nWilhelmshöhe.\r\n\r\nA month had hardly passed since the outbreak of the war, and one of the\r\ntwo great French armies with the Emperor had been captured; the other\r\nwas besieged in Metz. Gambetta and other prominent men in Paris set\r\nup the government of the national defense. A republic was proclaimed.\r\nThe defense of Paris was zealously undertaken. Large supplies of\r\nprovisions were gathered. Fortifications were strengthened. The siege\r\nbegan September 19, 1870, and ended January 28, 1871. The direst famine\r\nattended it. Gambetta left Paris in a balloon, and at Tours succeeded\r\nin forming the army of the Loire and the army of the North. Both were\r\ndefeated. Strasbourg was captured, and Metz surrendered with a hundred\r\nand seventy-three thousand men, among them three marshals of France.\r\nThe entire German loss in this war was 129,700 men.\r\n\r\nJanuary 17, 1871, Thiers was elected President of the Third Republic.\r\nKnowing the impossibility of further resistance, with half a million\r\nGerman soldiers, flushed and inspired by constant success, on the\r\nsoil of France, and Paris in their anaconda coils, he counseled that\r\npeace be asked. Thiers, Favre, and Picard negotiated with William and\r\nBismarck. An armistice of twenty days was permitted, that the National\r\nConvention then at Bordeaux might ratify terms. In the meantime the\r\nhouse of Hohenzollern reached the summit of its gratified ambition,\r\nwhen, on March 18, William was crowned at Versailles, Emperor of\r\nGermany. The cession of Alsace and Lorraine, and $1,000,000,000\r\nindemnity, was the price of peace.\r\n\r\nNo patriot name in all history deserves more reverence than that of\r\nLouis Adolphe Thiers. Upon him devolved the task of making peace with\r\nthe German foe, of quelling the civil war, and of so managing the\r\nfinances of France, that her people within two years were enabled, to\r\nthe astonishment of the world, to pay the enormous indemnity extorted\r\nby the Germans, and, by September, 1873, the last franc was paid and\r\nthe last German sentinel removed from the soil of France.\r\n\r\nThe civil war between the Republic and the Commune settled the\r\nquestion once for all, that _Paris_, accountable for all the errors\r\nand vicissitudes of the country, is not _France_, and there is every\r\nreason to hope that out of the unequaled horrors of those awful days\r\nof carnage the republican government of France arose to remain in\r\nperpetuity.\r\n\r\nGaribaldi, taking advantage of the fall of Louis Napoleon, and caring\r\nnot for the king’s promises, took possession with his troops of the\r\ncity of Rome, September 20, 1870, and on July 2 of the next year Victor\r\nEmmanuel erected his throne in the Quirinal.\r\n\r\nTURCO-RUSSIAN WAR.—In 1875, the Bosnians, Turkish subjects, revolted.\r\nThey maintained their struggle, and the enraged Turks sent Mohammedan\r\ntroops among the defenseless Bulgarians, destroying unnumbered\r\nthousands of men, women, and children. Czar Alexander declared war\r\nApril 1, 1877. His army crossed the Balkans and occupied Shipka Pass.\r\nOsman Pasha developed unexpected military genius and skill. For five\r\nmonths he checked the onward march of the Russians and won world-wide\r\nadmiration by his defense of Plevna. By the first of December Plevna\r\nwas invested completely by the Russians. Driven back whenever\r\nattempting to make a sortie, starvation compelled Osman to surrender\r\nwith forty-four thousand troops. Adrianople was occupied. The Treaty of\r\nSan Stefano was wrested in sight of Constantinople. It greatly reduced\r\nTurkish power in Europe, and constituted Russia heir to Turkey in\r\nEurope. Bulgaria was to be protected by fifty thousand Russian troops\r\nfor two years and to have a Christian governor.\r\n\r\nThree months later, England formed a secret treaty with Turkey,\r\nsecuring Cyprus and agreeing to protect Turkey in Asia. Austria,\r\ntoo, was dissatisfied, and the treaty of Berlin was made in 1878, to\r\nrectify the balances of the nations. Russia was by this treaty damaged\r\nin prestige and, shorn of triumphs, was given only Asiatic provinces.\r\nTurkey was stripped of all real power in Europe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOUIS ADOLPHE THIERS.]\r\n\r\nCHINO-JAPANESE WAR.—In Japan’s declaration of war against China,\r\nAugust 1, 1894, she set forth succinctly the provocation forcing her\r\nto this action. She said that Korea had been brought into the notice\r\nof the nations of the world by her efforts; that China constantly had\r\ninterfered with Korea’s government, insistently posing as her suzerain;\r\nthat when an insurrection in Korea broke out China sent troops into\r\nKorea, and that when Japan, under the treaty of 1885, also sent troops\r\nto assist Korea to quell the rebels, asking China’s coöperation in the\r\neffort, China refused her rightful demand; that China’s course tended\r\nto keep up the trouble indefinitely, so that the only course left for\r\nJapan was to declare war.\r\n\r\nAs with Germany a score of years previously, when the time came\r\nJapan was ready, not only with munitions of war, but with better\r\ntopographical knowledge of the enemy’s country than they themselves\r\npossessed. The Emperor, whose dynasty antedates the Christian era,\r\ngave his people a constitution, and stretching his hand towards\r\nKorea he helped her in the same direction. He had Japan’s army and\r\nher navy drilled by expert European officers. Arsenals and extensive\r\nmanufactories for the implements of war were started, with European\r\nsuperintendents. The latest and best of ships were both bought at\r\nforeign marts and made at home. Her students were to be found in the\r\nuniversities of the world. Her agents were sent to study in their\r\ncapitals the economy of every government and the machinery of their\r\nexecutive departments. To find the best and assimilate it seemed the\r\nprinciple of her progression, so that both in military skill and the\r\nknowledge of diplomacy she acquired the ability to hold her place among\r\nthe nations of the civilized world. A war alone was needed to prove\r\nthat this was a fact.\r\n\r\nJapan’s navy consisted of four armored cruisers and eight vessels of\r\n3000 tons each. This was a much lighter fleet than that of China, but\r\nswifter. China’s navy had been trained by an able English naval chief,\r\nCaptain Lang. Her outfit of ships was, perhaps, superior to that of\r\nJapan, consisting of five armored vessels, nine protected cruisers,\r\nand torpedo boats besides. The principal battle of this Chino-Japanese\r\nwar was fought on September 15 at Ping Yang, an old capital of Korea,\r\nsituated at the meeting of several roads. The Japanese landed troops at\r\nGensan, on the northeast, and at Hwang-jo, on the northwest, coast of\r\nKorea. These formed the right and left wings of the army whose centre,\r\nunder General Nodju, advanced from Seoul, about one hundred miles to\r\nthe south, of which the Japanese were already in possession. Only one\r\nwing of the army met opposition in its march, a small battle having\r\nbeen fought. The forces, so far as we can learn, were between twenty\r\nand thirty thousand of Chinese and between thirty and forty thousand\r\nof Japanese. Japan’s twenty-four years of scientific preparation,\r\nher study of the art of war, the practicability of her strategic\r\nmovements,—admired by the soldiers of the world,—left China, with her\r\nold semi-barbarian methods, no chance for victory.\r\n\r\nThe battle was a bloody one; the defeated Chinese fled until they were\r\non the other side of the Yalu River, in Manchooria. Seven hundred (some\r\naccounts say fourteen thousand) Chinese were captured, two thousand\r\nkilled and wounded. The army continued fighting and conquering until\r\npractically the province of Manchooria was in Japan’s possession, as\r\nwell as the peninsula of Liaotung, terminating with Port Arthur.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Yalu, or Hai Yun Tao, afforded the first practical test\r\nof modern vessels, guns, and projectiles in Asiatic waters. Ping Yang\r\nhas been called China’s Sedan, and Yalu, Japan’s Trafalgar. Japan had\r\nnine cruisers and two converted cruisers wherewith to fight twelve\r\nChinese warships and four torpedo boats. It is said that Japan used\r\nmelanite shells. The fleet of Chinese warships, convoying transports\r\nwith ten thousand troops, entered the Yalu River. The next day,\r\nSeptember 17, the Japanese fleet, under Admiral Ito, went out to meet\r\nthem. A European officer on a Chinese vessel says: “Passing along the\r\nChinese line, the Japanese poured as heavy a fire as they could bring\r\nto bear upon each ship in succession, and, while they had sea-room,\r\ncircled round their opponents. The Japanese state that no Japanese\r\nwar-ship was lost and only three seriously injured.” A Chinese officer\r\nsays: “As soon as the Chinese on the port side had brought their guns\r\nto bear and had obtained range accurately, the Japanese would work\r\naround and attack the starboard side.” Four ships were destroyed and\r\ntwo badly injured. One of the Chinese ships was said to have been\r\nhit two hundred times. The Chinese ironclads that escaped were later\r\nsunk off Wei Hai Wei. Port Arthur, captured October 21, was filled to\r\noverflowing with ammunition, grain, and other supplies.\r\n\r\nChina made three informal overtures for peace. Finally, Li Hung\r\nChang went from Tientsin to Shimonoseki, to make terms, on the 19th\r\nof March, 1895. By the treaty there made, May 17, China recognized\r\nthe independence and autonomy of Korea, ceded certain territory in\r\nManchooria, all the islands in the eastern part of the bay of Liaotung\r\nand the northern part of the Yellow Sea, Formosa, and all islands\r\nbelonging to it, and the Pescadores group. Two hundred million Kuping\r\ntaels were exacted as indemnity, to be paid in eight installments, one\r\nevery six months. The inhabitants were to sell out and leave, or in two\r\nyears to be Japanese subjects. Russia, Germany, and France recommended\r\nthat Japan should not permanently possess the peninsula of Feng Tan,\r\nand Japan agreed to their suggestions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAVALRY CHARGE AT GRAVELOTTE. (A. DE NEUVILLE.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BATTLE OF YALU RIVER.]\r\n\r\nFormosa, as a strategetical post, is of the greatest value. Korea and\r\nJapan now control absolutely the Japan Sea. It was only after four\r\nmonths of fighting that Japan completely conquered the Formosans and\r\nhad all her new possessions under her control.\r\n\r\nChina paid Japan an additional $30,000,000 for the release of Port\r\nArthur and Liaotung peninsula. China was well pleased. But in April,\r\n1897, Russia herself had obtained possession of Port Arthur and Talien\r\nWan, and in December the Germans received Kaio Chao, the finest naval\r\nstation of the province of Shantung. France subsequently obtained\r\nKwang-Chau, the best port of Wangsi; and England, though not joining\r\nthese powers in the demand in favor of China in 1895, obtained Wei Hai\r\nWei in 1897.\r\n\r\nGRECO-TURKISH WAR.—In 1895, the fearful atrocities committed by the\r\n“unspeakable” Turk began to assume appalling proportions. During three\r\nyears one hundred thousand Cretans were murdered. February 8, 1897,\r\nthe Cretans proclaimed union with Greece. The Greeks, unable longer to\r\nendure the sufferings of their kindred, determined to help them.\r\n\r\nPrince George left for Crete with a torpedo flotilla February 10;\r\nColonel Vassos, aide-de-camp to the king, followed with fifteen hundred\r\nmen and two batteries on the 13th. Prince Nicholas led a regiment of\r\nartillery to the Thessalian frontiers. The powers sent a collective\r\nnote of protest to Greece, but it was not heeded. Colonel Vassos landed\r\nin Crete on the 14th. Sailors from the fleet of the powers occupied\r\nthe coast towns of Crete. Pasha Berovitch resigned and returned to\r\nConstantinople. Greek reserves rallied promptly. Volunteers offered.\r\nColonel Vassos established headquarters in the mountainous interior at\r\nSphakia.\r\n\r\nMarch 18, the powers blockaded Crete. On the 27th, Crown Prince\r\nConstantine proceeded to the Turkish frontier. On April 5, the powers\r\ndeclared no gain should accrue to the combatant who approached\r\nThessalian borders. April 8, three thousand Greeks crossed near Krania,\r\nbegan fighting, and were driven back. On April 17 Turkey declared\r\nwar. On the 18th, a battle of twenty-four hours, in Milouna Pass,\r\ncrowned Turkish arms with victory. Another hard fought battle, at\r\nReveni, discomfited the Greeks. Greeks passed the Arta River and Greek\r\nironclads bombarded Prevessa. On the 19th, the Turks were in Thessaly\r\nand the Greeks in retreat to Larissa. After terrific battles Tornavo\r\nand Larissa, on the 25th, fell into the hands of the Turks. Colonel\r\nSmolenski fought desperately at Valestino, but had to yield; and Volo\r\nalso fell to the Turks. The Turks occupied Pharsaos on May 6. Greece\r\nasked the powers for peace, May 8; Cretan autonomy was agreed to, and\r\nTurkey permitted armistice on the 15th. The war closed. Turkey was\r\nforced to yield all Thessalian territory, and Crete was relieved of\r\nTurkish oppression. Greece was forced to withdraw all support from\r\nCrete and pay $20,000,000 indemnity.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable feature of this war was the intensely hard fighting from\r\nstart to close, and the disposition of the powers to assist Turkey by\r\ninterfering with the Grecian navy. Frequently the Austrians helped the\r\nTurks by placing their guns in position. It was only when the Sultan\r\nconquered Thessaly and threatened to keep it that the powers interposed.\r\n\r\nThe crime committed by the powers against civilization and Christianity\r\nby their action seems incredible, even though the peace of Europe was\r\nthereby secured.\r\n\r\nENGLAND’S WARS IN THE SOUDAN.—The Khedive of Egypt had obtained great\r\nloans from Europe. England and France took financial control of the\r\ncountry. Arabi Pasha inaugurated a rebellion and fortified Alexandria.\r\nMany Europeans were murdered, and England bombarded the city, taking\r\npossession July 12, 1882. General Wolseley, at Tel el Kebir, September\r\n13, fought and defeated Arabi, who fled leaving two thousand dead.\r\nFrance withdrew from the financial arrangement. The English remained\r\nto put the Egyptians in condition for self-government. England has\r\nremained ever since.\r\n\r\nMohammed Ahmed arose in the Soudan, proclaiming himself El Mahdi,\r\nthe Mussulman Messiah. The barbarian hordes flocked to his banner.\r\nHe defeated the Egyptians in four engagements, October, 1883. The\r\nAnglo-Egyptian force of ten thousand men, under General Hicks, was\r\ndestroyed, only two escaping. General Gordon was sent to the relief of\r\nthe Egyptian army. He reached Khartoum, February 18, 1884. The Mahdists\r\nbesieged the city. Gordon sent for reinforcements. England was so slow\r\nin sending them that they arrived two days too late. Khartoum was\r\ncaptured through treachery, and Gordon, the most beloved of English\r\nsoldiers for his saintly and heroic character, was put to death on\r\nJanuary 27, 1885.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sir Horatio Herbert Kitchener was made Sirdar in 1890. He\r\nstarted from Cairo with one thousand British and fifteen thousand\r\nEgyptians, black and fellah troops, building a road across the desert\r\nas he advanced, and engineering his gunboats up the Nile. The distance\r\nfrom his base, at Cairo, to his first storehouse, at Wady Halfa, is\r\neight hundred miles. April 8, 1898, was fought the battle of Atbara, a\r\nfort at the point where the Atbara River enters the Nile. Here Mahmud,\r\nthe commander of the barbarians, was captured and his army of twelve\r\nthousand infantry destroyed. Osman Digna got away with the greater part\r\nof the cavalry, numbering four thousand.\r\n\r\nThe force was about a month reaching Wady Hamed, and, September 1,\r\nwas in sight of Omdurman. The Sirdar’s line was drawn up in crescent\r\nform, with Omdurman and Khartoum for its centre. In this position was\r\nfought the first battle of Egeda, in which twenty-two thousand of the\r\nDervishes fell. The Khalifa and Osman Digna fled with a scant handful\r\nof followers, and are now said to be bandits in the Kordofan. The\r\nnumber of the annihilated army of the Mahdists will never be known.\r\nThe British loss of whites was less than two hundred, and the native\r\nloss less than three hundred. The fire of the barbarians was generally\r\ntoo high to effect great injury. September 2 will be a marked day in\r\nEngland’s calendar. The Sirdar marched into Khartoum, the Union Jack\r\nwas raised, and beneath its floating crosses his chaplains performed\r\nGordon’s funeral ceremonies on the spot where he was slain nearly\r\nfourteen years before.\r\n\r\nTHE BOER WAR.—By the treaty of 1881 Great Britain claimed suzerainty\r\nover the South African (Transvaal) Republic and Orange Free State.\r\nThese Republics claimed that by the treaty of 1884 Great Britain gave\r\nup her claim of suzerainty. Here arose an issue which was aggravated\r\nby the discovery of diamonds at Kimberley and of gold at Johannesburg,\r\nfollowed by the Jameson raid, which, shorn of its disguise, was notice\r\nto the Boers that Great Britain desired and designed to occupy and\r\nabsorb their two Republics. The diplomatic war went on for years\r\nbetween President Kruger, of the Transvaal, and Mr. Chamberlain, Great\r\nBritain’s Colonial Secretary. It culminated in an ultimatum on the\r\npart of Kruger, on October 9, 1899, which Chamberlain rejected. Both\r\nsides had been preparing for this, and on October 11, the outbreak\r\nof the war, Great Britain had already an army of 25,000 men in South\r\nAfrica, while the Boers had mobilized an equal, if not superior, army\r\nof effectives. The Boers immediately invaded Natal and Cape Colony,\r\nshutting up General White and his army in Ladysmith, and Colonel\r\nPowell and his forces in Mafeking. Kimberley was also besieged. The\r\ninitial battles were numerous, fierce, and generally favorable to the\r\nBoers. Great Britain’s eyes were speedily opened to the gravity of\r\nthe situation. She hurried large reinforcements to the scene till her\r\narmies far outnumbered those of the Boers. Yet her best generals, as\r\nBuller at Tugela River, and Methuen, at Magersfontein, continued to\r\nmeet with disastrous defeats. Lord Roberts, in connection with General\r\nKitchener, was sent, January 10, 1900, to supersede the blundering\r\ngenerals, and to organize a new campaign. It was seen that direct\r\nbattle against the Boers was bound to end in defeat. So Roberts was\r\nprovided with an overwhelming army, estimated at 225,000, and he\r\nat once entered upon a war of strategy. His northward advance was\r\ngeneral along his lines, thus keeping the Boers divided. He flanked\r\nthem out of their strongholds. By February he had invaded the Orange\r\nFree State, and raised the siege of Kimberley. On February 27 he\r\ncaptured General Cronje and his force of 4000 men, and on March 13 took\r\npossession of Bloemfontein, the Free State capital, whence he issued\r\na proclamation annexing the republic under the name of Orange River\r\nColony. On February 28 the siege of Ladysmith was raised, and shortly\r\nafter that of Mafeking. The Boers continued to fight doggedly, all\r\nthe while inflicting heavy losses on their enemy, but resistance was\r\nfutile against such overwhelming odds. They were gradually forced from\r\none position to another in the direction of Pretoria, the Transvaal\r\ncapital. On March 5 Presidents Kruger and Steyn joined in peace\r\nproposals, which were rejected. On March 12 they made an appeal to the\r\nnations for mediation. All refused to mediate. On March 27 the Boers\r\nlost their ablest general in the person of General Joubert, who died\r\nat Pretoria. By May 12 Kroonstad, the second Free State capital, had\r\nfallen into Lord Roberts’ hands. The Vaal River was then crossed and\r\nthe Transvaal invaded. On May 31 the British army entered the important\r\ntown of Johannesburg, and hastened toward Pretoria, which was captured\r\non June 5, 1900. President Kruger and General Botha had left a few days\r\nbefore, the former in the direction of the Portuguese port of Lorenzo\r\nMarques, the latter with the remnant of the Boer army to the mountains\r\nbeyond Pretoria. On September 3 Lord Roberts declared the Transvaal\r\nannexed to Great Britain under the name of the Vaal River Colony.\r\nGenerals Botha and De Wet continued a guerrilla warfare far past\r\nthe end of the century. President Kruger accepted the protection of\r\nHolland, and sailed thither on October 20, 1900. Lord Roberts arrived\r\nin England in December, 1900, to receive his honors. At the turn of the\r\ncentury the South African problem was a most wearying one for Great\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\nTHE BOXER UPRISING.—The defeat of China by Japan in 1894, the ambition\r\nof European powers to occupy her ports and enlarge their “spheres of\r\ninfluence,” the ominous threats to partition her territory, soured the\r\nManchu dynasty and the people of northern China against foreigners.\r\nThe Empress Dowager deposed the young Emperor, seized the reins of\r\ngovernment, and catered to that reactionary and hostile spirit which\r\nculminated in the “Boxer” uprising. These mobs began the destruction\r\nof missions, the murder and expulsion of missionaries, and concerted\r\nattack against everything that savored of foreign direction and\r\ninfluence. The Chinese regular soldiers were either helpless before\r\nthem or in sympathy with them. By May, 1900, all the powers represented\r\nat Peking stood aghast at the startling fact that their respective\r\nlegations were beleaguered in Peking, and liable to be murdered.\r\nWarships were instantly ordered to Taku. By June 1, 1900, twenty-three\r\nvessels had reported,—nine Russian, three British, three German,\r\nthree French, two American, two Japanese, one Italian. A force of 2000\r\nsoldiers was landed from these, and immediately started for Peking,\r\nunder command of the British Rear-Admiral Seymour, for the rescue of\r\nthe legations. This force was defeated by the “Boxers,” and compelled\r\nto retreat to Tien-Tsin with heavy loss. An attempt to torpedo the Taku\r\nharbor was resented by the warships. They bombarded and blew up the\r\nTaku forts. In this action the American warships did not participate.\r\nThe “Boxers” swarmed in Tien-Tsin, and an allied force of 4000 men was\r\nsent thither to capture it. In their first attack, on July 9, they were\r\nrepulsed with heavy loss. Being reinforced up to 7000 men, their second\r\nattack, on July 13, was successful. The city was taken, and made the\r\nbase of further operations against Peking, 80 miles up the Pei-ho. The\r\nallies were further reinforced, and started for Peking with an army of\r\n16,000 men. They met the Chinese army of 30,000 men at Pei-Tsang, and\r\nafter a severe battle on August 5, drove them from their fortifications\r\nwith great loss. The Chinese rallied at Yang-Tsun, but were again\r\ndefeated by the allies on August 6. They offered no further serious\r\nresistance to the allies, who moved swiftly on Pekin, invested it,\r\nand, on August 14, breached its walls and entered it in triumph. The\r\nlegations were relieved after an imprisonment of nearly three months.\r\nTwo ministers, one of Japan, the other of Germany, had been murdered.\r\nThe others had escaped death only by concentrating and defending\r\nthemselves in the English compound. The allied forces occupied the city\r\nfor a time, and then those of Russia and the United States withdrew,\r\nleaving a strong legation guard. The Chinese government appointed\r\nLi-Hung-Chang and Prince Ching ministers to meet ministers of the\r\npowers to arrange terms of settlement. After months of conference a\r\nprotocol was signed in January, 1901, which was supposed to contain the\r\ngerms of future settlement. But there was that in the Chinese situation\r\nwhich was bound to tax the diplomacy of the world during many years of\r\nthe twentieth century.\r\n\r\nA REVIEW OF MARTIAL RESULTS.—The history of the world shows that\r\nsuccessful war adds to the glory and prestige of the victorious nation,\r\nand this is particularly exemplified by the wars of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. France, so long victorious, dazzled the world. At Waterloo,\r\nher glory was clouded. Napier, in his closing words of the history\r\nof these events of the twenty years of war and turmoil, showed how\r\nthoroughly the English people appreciated that their greatness\r\nand power were due to the glory achieved by the arms of Britain’s\r\nchivalrous sons.\r\n\r\nWhile England was covering herself with glory, her offspring, the\r\nUnited States, was teaching her, in the war of 1812, that being now of\r\nage his pockets were not again to be turned inside out, a lesson which\r\nthereafter she heeded.\r\n\r\nGreece, throbbing with the impulse of freedom, achieved her\r\nindependence, displaying all the heroism of her Hellenic ancestry.\r\n\r\nThe Mexican war added greatly to the glory of American arms and\r\nresulted in the acquisition of a vast territory, whose inhabitants\r\nquickly assimilated themselves to the requirements of American\r\ncitizenship.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution of ’48 but served to consolidate the power of Prussia,\r\nlaying the foundation for the Imperial crown to rest upon the head of\r\nher king, while fitting France for her future solid republican career.\r\n\r\nThe Crimean war, except that it checked the policy of Russia, produced\r\nfew results in comparison with the vast amount of blood and treasure so\r\nlavishly spent.\r\n\r\nThe victories of Magenta and Solferino illumined again the eagles of\r\nFrance. The “Seven Weeks’ War,” while still further consolidating\r\nGermany under Prussia, was not without its blessings for Austria, and\r\nadvanced “Young Italy” greatly toward the goal of her ambition.\r\n\r\nIn America, the appeal to arms was made to decide the questions mooted\r\nsince the nation’s birth. One effect of this war was to show the\r\nwonderful prowess and soldierly qualities of the American citizen.\r\n\r\nThe Franco-Prussian war lifted the dignity of Hohenzollern to its\r\nheight, ended forever the Empire of France in a crushing fall, and\r\ntaught the lesson of scientific preparation for war, than which no\r\nscience is more worthy of intense study and application in all its\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\nThe Chino-Japanese war was a triumph of a growing civilization over\r\nsemi-barbarism, and foreshadows the prominent rôle that Japan may be\r\ncalled upon to play in the twentieth century. The enlargement of her\r\nterritory was a fitting reward for her unselfish championing of her\r\nweaker sister, Korea.\r\n\r\nThe Greco-Cretan-Turkish war shed no glory on the Turkish nor on the\r\nso-called Christian nations, and will stand on history’s page as a\r\ncrowning shame to European civilization.\r\n\r\nThe opening of Africa by General Kitchener and his great achievements\r\nread like old-time stories, and the twentieth century may see great\r\nresults in Africa from this wonderful campaign.\r\n\r\nThe war of the United States with Spain, fought because it was\r\nimpossible longer to allow the atrocities of her rule on this\r\nhemisphere at our very doors, has brought conditions not dreamed of,\r\nand which, under the providence of God, may lead to greater results in\r\nthe development of Christian civilization than we now may comprehend.\r\n\r\nThe Boer war had little instigation on the part of Great Britain,\r\nexcept greed. Its management reflected no credit on her military\r\ngenius, weakened her in the eyes of nations, and entailed a loss of\r\nlife and money from which she will not recover in generations.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese disturbance did not rise to the dignity of war, but opened\r\nproblems of startling intricacy and moment for all the powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CENTURY’S FAIRS AND EXPOSITIONS\r\n\r\nBY GEORGE J. HAGAR,\r\n\r\n_Editor of Appendix to Encyclopædia Britannica_.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Alfred Russell Wallace, in a recent work, argues that the\r\nnineteenth century is altogether unique in that it inaugurated a new\r\nera. To grasp its marvelous achievements, he tells us, it should be\r\ncompared with a long historical period, rather than with another\r\ncentury, however happily selected. The progress it environs is set\r\ndown as almost wholly material and intellectual, and the palm for\r\ncompleteness is given to the material. Debatable as his conclusion\r\nmay be, there can be no dispute either as to the qualitative or\r\nquantitative progress in the material advancement of mankind in the\r\ncentury now closing. In the present retrospect the broader view becomes\r\napparent,—that the material and the intellectual have been allied\r\nforces that have constantly pushed forward side by side, one devising\r\nin the solitude that genius needs for expansion, the other showing to\r\nthe world the realizations of thought that in practical application\r\nbenefit all.\r\n\r\nThe evolution of the international exposition of to-day is a\r\nconspicuous result of this material and intellectual wedlock. It\r\nseems a long time between the fair that was held to allow people not\r\nclosely settled to purchase the ordinary commodities of life, food,\r\nclothing, and household belongings, and the great expositions to which\r\nthe nations of the world bring the surpassing embodiments of native\r\nthought. Measured by years, the time is really beyond computation;\r\nbut measured by results, mere time is annihilated, and the progress\r\nthat the evolution illustrates is found to have kept a steady pace\r\nwith man’s physical necessities and intellectual growth. The moment\r\nNecessity has shown that mankind needed something to make life\r\nbrighter, happier, or more comfortable to pass through, Intellect has\r\nundertaken the task of creating it and has fashioned out the Material.\r\n\r\nIn the great expositions of to-day are seen the effects of the\r\nmarvelous influence which sprang from the fair as a market, instituted\r\nso long ago that no call for the records is answerable. Of this\r\nkind, only a very few remain. Then came the fair designed to promote\r\nthe useful arts and manufactures; the fair to advance agriculture\r\nand allied industries; and the fair to show special articles, to\r\ncommemorate historical events, and to aid interests of large public\r\nconcern. Under an ever-increasing expansion, stimulated by popular\r\nfavor, the fair, with the commercial feature abandoned or having it\r\nonly as a restricted branch, became the exhibition to show a larger\r\ndevelopment of the arts, sciences, and mechanical trades; to celebrate\r\ngreat public occurrences on a grander scale than earlier fairs had\r\ndone; to promote special industries, local or national; to aid\r\neducation by permanent displays of natural or manufactured products;\r\nand to promote the commercial intercourse of the world. From the first\r\nof this class of exhibitions came the international undertakings, first\r\nknown as world’s fairs, and afterward as international exhibitions and\r\nexpositions. In some one of these classes may be found every kind of a\r\ndisplay of products, irrespective of its purpose or individual name.\r\n\r\nThe development of the modern exhibition from the early fair has\r\nbeen confined to no one country nor people. Everywhere the purpose\r\nand process have been the same. A few years changed the old-time\r\nmart, where people went to buy what they knew they would find, to the\r\nconvenient place where tradesmen placed on view the things they knew\r\npeople would need and buy, as well as articles offered at a venture\r\nthat people who really didn’t need them might be tempted to purchase\r\nbecause of novelty or other quality. Thus, the bargain counter and\r\nthe department store are several hundred years older than the thrifty\r\nhousewife of to-day reckons.\r\n\r\nTrade competition, then as now, led to a broadening of plans, rival\r\nefforts, and special attractions. People began to attend fairs to see\r\nwhat was new, as well as to buy; and soon, lest they should tire of\r\nsightseeing, it became necessary to provide means for entertaining\r\nthem. Punch and Judy came on the scene with perennial popularity.\r\nJugglery astounded the young and fascinated their elders. Dancing\r\nand wrestling rings proved sportive magnets of annually increasing\r\nstrength. The fair now began to change from a strictly commercial\r\nundertaking to an occasion for holiday hilarity, and soon trade and\r\namusement were struggling for the mastery. In many places, hilarity\r\nled to excesses, and excesses to crime. Public opinion demanded the\r\nforceful intervention of the law, and one by one the most demoralizing\r\nfairs were suppressed, the notorious Donnybrook closing its long career\r\nof debauchery and lighting in 1855.\r\n\r\nThe display of merchandise and the gathering of customers at the\r\nmost noted fairs in time became really enormous, and for many years\r\nthe great fairs of the day were held on open and extensive plains.\r\nThen, too, the fair assumed an importance that led first the local\r\nauthorities, and after them higher dignitaries, to seek to turn it\r\nto their individual advantage. For a time no fair could be held in\r\nGreat Britain without a special grant from the crown, and it was a\r\nwidely observed custom for royal or ecclesiastical authorities to give\r\npermission to a town or village that had suffered some misfortune to\r\nhold a fair as a means of reestablishing itself. The famous fair of St.\r\nGiles’s Hill, near Manchester, England, was instituted as a revenue to\r\nthe bishop by William the Conqueror. That it was a valuable monopoly is\r\nshown by the facts that its jurisdiction extended seven miles around\r\nthe city, and that all merchants who sold wares within that circuit,\r\nunless at the fair, forfeited them to the bishop.\r\n\r\nA curious evidence of early international interest in the fair, as well\r\nas of its importance and influence, is found in the records of 1314,\r\nwhen King Philip of France sent a formal complaint to King Edward II.\r\nof England, to the effect that the merchants of England had ceased\r\nfrequenting the fairs in his dominions with their wood and other\r\ngoods, to the great loss of his subjects. Philip entreated Edward to\r\npersuade, and, if necessary, to compel, English people to frequent the\r\nfairs of France as formerly, promising them all possible security and\r\nencouragement.\r\n\r\nAs a purely commercial institution, the fair had its best day\r\nwhen people were widely separated. The increase of population,\r\nthe development of new life and activity by growing communities,\r\nthe opening of means of travel between distant points, and the\r\nestablishment of stores and markets, were all fatal to the commercial\r\nfair. To-day, in all Europe, only three really great annual fairs of\r\nthis character remain,—those of Nijni-Novgorod, in Russia; Beaucaire,\r\nin France; and Leipsic, in Germany. The same conditions that brought\r\nthe popular usefulness of the commercial fair to an end were the forces\r\nfrom which the fair as an exponent of industrial achievement has been\r\ndeveloped, and the material progress of the nineteenth century is to be\r\ntraced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MUNICH EXPOSITION, 1854.]\r\n\r\nFor the modern fair in all of its forms the world is indebted to the\r\nSociety of Arts, of London, an organization whose fame in America\r\nwas so great that Benjamin Franklin, in soliciting corresponding\r\nmembership, declared that he would esteem it a great honor to be\r\nadmitted and also to be permitted to contribute twenty guineas to be\r\nexpended in premiums. What this Society in its early days did for Great\r\nBritain it did also for civilization. It organized the first exhibition\r\nof specimens of improvements in the useful arts and manufactures in\r\n1760; stimulated native ingenuity by judicious awards of prizes and\r\npremiums for exhibits of exceptional merit; and extended its powerful\r\ninfluence to foster art, science, mechanical and agricultural industry,\r\nand the fishery trade and colonial commerce of the country.\r\n\r\nOf the many influences of this Society that came to the United States,\r\nit may be questioned if any had a more lasting benefit for both people\r\nand country than that which gave birth to the mechanics’ institutes.\r\nThere are people still living who are able to recall how the large\r\ncities in the Eastern and Middle States vied with each other in the\r\nestablishment of two great and kindred institutions—the mechanics’\r\ninstitute and the apprentices’ library. Philadelphia led the cities\r\nin the matter of time, her Franklin Institute being founded in 1824.\r\nFour years afterward the American Institute was chartered in New\r\nYork City. After these came the Massachusetts Charitable Mechanics’\r\nAssociation in Boston, the Maryland Institute in Baltimore, and\r\nnumerous others,—those mentioned being the principal ones that still\r\nmaintain annual or other exhibitions. At first, the exhibitions of\r\nthese institutes, like the first one ever held under the patronage\r\nof a national government,—that in Paris in 1798,—were composed of\r\nvarious articles loaned by their owners. Soon, however, the popularity\r\nof the institutes and the awarding of prizes and diplomas brought to\r\nthe exhibitions specimens of the handicraft of members and friends, and\r\nthe rising lights in the arts and manufactures became eager to secure\r\nthe recognition of their genius that such awards established. Thus, the\r\ninfluence of the principal surviving institutes has spread far beyond\r\nlocal limits.\r\n\r\nPurely national exhibitions have never found much popular favor in\r\nthe United States. When as a whole people we decide to hold one\r\nfor a purpose of general interest, we prefer to set a large table\r\nand invite the universe to help us celebrate. In France, the first\r\nnational exhibition was a loan exhibition. Its effect, however, was\r\nso immediate that the government repeated it the same year, organized\r\nmore elaborate ones in 1801 and 1802, and decided to hold them\r\ntriennially thereafter—a course that has since been interrupted by\r\npolitical exigencies. These exhibitions were projected to illustrate\r\nthe progress of France only. In the United States there have been no\r\nState exhibitions, excepting agricultural fairs, for which outside\r\ncoöperation has not been invited.\r\n\r\nThe life of the American agricultural fair is almost measurable by the\r\nfull century. This, too, had its origin in England. The father of the\r\nAmerican system of combined agricultural fairs and cattle shows was\r\nElkanah Watson, a native of Plymouth, Mass., who spent the greater part\r\nof his life in promoting large public measures besides agriculture\r\nand education. In 1807 he removed from Albany, N. Y., to Pittsfield,\r\nMass., where he engaged in general and experimental agriculture and\r\ncattle-raising. His efforts to improve local farming conditions and\r\nto raise a superior breed of cattle attracted widespread interest,\r\nand this suggested to him that an annual exhibition of cattle and of\r\nfarm products, resulting from a more painstaking system of cultivation\r\nthan was commonly followed, would prove of material advantage to the\r\nfarmer, the breeder, and the general public. Accordingly, he induced\r\nhis farming friends in the country to contribute specimens of improved\r\nbreeds of cattle and of superior products of the soil; and the first\r\nexhibition or fair was held in 1810. This, with modest prizes for the\r\nbest exhibits, proved a complete success.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEW ORLEANS EXPOSITION. 1884.\r\n\r\n(Illumination of Horticultural Building on Christmas Night.)]\r\n\r\nEncouraged by the results of his initial efforts, he went to Boston to\r\nsolicit pecuniary aid for a second and much larger exhibition. Although\r\nhe was at that time widely known for his public-spirited philanthropy,\r\nand also as the founder of the influential Berkshire Agricultural\r\nSociety, his appeals for aid brought him little save derision. To\r\nshow how small concern was felt by business and public men toward the\r\nfarming industry, a sentence in a letter from ex-President John Adams\r\nto Mr. Watson is sufficient:—\r\n\r\n   “You will get no aid from Boston; commerce, literature, theology,\r\n    medicine, the university, and universal politics are against you.”\r\n\r\nThe ex-President was correct in his judgment. Mr. Watson did not\r\nreceive a single favorable response to his appeals; yet he lost\r\nnot a particle of faith in the wisdom of his undertaking. With the\r\ncoöperation only of the farmers in his county, Mr. Watson succeeded\r\nin arranging annual exhibitions until 1816, when he returned to\r\nAlbany. The same year he organized the first agricultural society in\r\nthe State of New York, and began establishing fairs and cattle shows\r\nin the near-by counties. In 1819 he secured the passage of an Act by\r\nthe Legislature appropriating $10,000 annually for six years for the\r\npromotion of agriculture and domestic manufactures, conditional on a\r\nlike amount being raised by the agricultural societies in the different\r\ncounties. A State Society was incorporated in 1832, to which county\r\nsocieties were directed to report, while it, in turn, had to render a\r\ncombined report to the Legislature annually.\r\n\r\nSince then an agricultural department has become an indispensable\r\npart of the government of the various States and Territories, even of\r\nthose that are popularly believed to be only metallic producers. The\r\ncharacter of the state and county agricultural fair has been undergoing\r\na radical change for many years, especially in sections thickly settled\r\nor near large cities, and the chief attractions have passed from the\r\nexhibition of sleek domestic animals and choice fruits of the soil to\r\nhorse-racing and bicycle contests. Innovations foreign to the spirit\r\nand intention of the fair have already wrought its ruin in many places\r\nand are threatening it generally.\r\n\r\nOf American fairs in the original commercial sense, those held during\r\nthe Civil War, to aid the work of the United States Sanitary Commission\r\non the battlefield and in the camp and hospital, will always be\r\nhistorically conspicuous. During those memorable four years it is\r\ndoubtful if there was a single city, town, or village in the Northern\r\nStates that did not put forth a special effort to provide necessities\r\nand conveniences for the soldiers and sailors that were not supplied by\r\nthe government, and the fair was the most popular form of raising the\r\nneedful money.\r\n\r\nExhibitions of special articles, possessing the features of state,\r\nnational, and international combinations, and independent of any\r\nlocality, event, or period of time, are growing in frequency. Many of\r\nthese have a predominating technical interest,—as the international\r\nexhibitions of fisheries and fishery methods, of life-saving methods\r\nand apparatus, of forestry products and systems of forest preservation,\r\nand of railway appliances; while others combine the technical and\r\npopular features, as the exhibitions of electrical apparatus, of\r\nimproved food preparations, of bicycles, of automobile vehicles, and of\r\nwood-working and labor-saving machinery.\r\n\r\nSpecial exhibitions in the United States that possess a large popular\r\ninterest include the annual showing of the art associations and leagues\r\nin the principal cities, and the annual horse, dog, and sportsmen’s\r\nshows in New York city. Among them also are to be noted the permanent\r\nexpositions in Philadelphia and Chicago—both reminders of the greatest\r\ninternational expositions that had been held up to their day. The\r\nPhiladelphia exposition is held in Memorial Hall, the building erected\r\nin Fairmount Park by the State of Pennsylvania at a cost of $1,500,000,\r\nand used for the Art Gallery of the Centennial Exposition in 1876. It\r\nnow contains an art and industrial collection similar to the famous\r\nSouth Kensington Museum in London. The Chicago exposition is in the\r\nformer Art Palace of the World’s Columbian Exposition in 1893, and,\r\nhaving been endowed by Marshall Field with $1,000,000, is now known\r\nas the Field Columbian Museum. Its most conspicuous feature is a\r\ncollection showing the development of the railway, and the next, its\r\nforestry exhibits. In the line of permanent expositions, Philadelphia\r\nis to be credited with two commercial museums of far-reaching influence\r\nthat will be considered further on.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EIFFEL TOWER. PARIS EXPOSITION, 1888.]\r\n\r\nThe first exhibition of the industries of all nations was that held\r\nin Hyde Park, London, in 1851. It was an outgrowth of the annual\r\nexhibitions of the Society of Arts, before mentioned, and was at first\r\ndesigned to be only a national enterprise, but on a more extended scale\r\nthan the former exhibitions of the Society. The late Prince Albert,\r\nhusband of Queen Victoria, however, conceived the idea of throwing this\r\nparticular exhibition open to the industry of the world. His suggestion\r\nat once met the favor of the Council of the Society, as well as of\r\nthe leading manufacturers of England and the general public. A royal\r\nwarrant was procured appointing a commission to “manage an exhibition\r\nof the works of industry of all nations,” and of this body Prince\r\nAlbert became president.\r\n\r\nOn February 21, 1850, the commissioners felt justified in making a\r\npublic announcement that the building would cover an area of from\r\nsixteen to twenty acres; that it would be ready for the reception of\r\ngoods by January 1, 1851; and that the exhibition would be opened to\r\nthe public on May 1, following. The plans for a building submitted\r\nby Sir Joseph Paxton were accepted after a large number had been\r\nconsidered. They called for a vast structure of iron and glass,\r\nsomewhat similar to the great conservatory he had erected for the Duke\r\nof Devonshire at Chatsworth. A contract was signed with Messrs. Fox and\r\nHenderson for the construction of the building, under which they were\r\nto receive £79,800, and the materials of the building were to remain\r\ntheir property. On February 3, the completed structure was formally\r\ndelivered to the commissioners. It had an extreme length of 1851 feet\r\nand an extreme breadth of 408 feet, with an additional projection on\r\nthe north side, 936 feet long by 48 feet wide.\r\n\r\nWhile the erection of the building was in progress, Dr. Lyon Playfair\r\nwas chosen to decide and classify the wide range of articles that was\r\nsought to be brought together under the general title of “Objects of\r\nIndustrial and Productive Art.” He arranged these under four great\r\nsections: Raw Materials, Machinery, Manufactures, and Fine Arts, and\r\nthey in turn were divided and subdivided into a vast number of classes\r\nand smaller divisions. The collecting of national exhibits was placed\r\nin the hands of district committees in all the principal towns and\r\nmanufacturing localities, and in response to invitations extended\r\nto all the British colonies and the various foreign governments,\r\nnearly every country in Europe, almost every State in the North\r\nAmerican Union, the South American republics, India, Egypt, Persia,\r\nand the far-off islands of the seas, sent objects that swelled the\r\ntotal estimated value of exhibits—excluding the renowned Koh-i-noor\r\ndiamond—to £1,781,929.\r\n\r\nThe exhibition was opened by Queen Victoria on the appointed day, and\r\nwas continued till October 11. The total number of exhibitors was\r\nabout 15,000. During the 114 days the exhibition was open a total of\r\n6,063,986 persons visited it, a daily average of 42,111. The largest\r\nnumber in a single day was on Tuesday of the closing week, 109,915.\r\nAn attempt to ascertain the number of foreign visitors developed the\r\nunexpected result that not much more than 40,000 foreigners visited\r\nLondon beyond the annual average of 15,000. The financial result of the\r\nexhibition was really remarkable. The total receipts from all sources\r\namounted to £506,000, and the total expenditures to about £330,000,\r\nleaving a surplus of £176,000, which was subsequently increased to\r\n£186,436.\r\n\r\nThe distinctions of all kinds that were awarded, Council and prize\r\nmedals and “honourable mentions,” aggregated 5084. It is here\r\ninteresting to note, as showing the truly international character\r\nof the first world’s exhibition, that foreign guests occupied\r\ntwo-fifths of the exhibition space and received three-fifths of the\r\nhonors. British exhibitors of machinery, manufactures in metal, and\r\nmanufactures in glass and porcelain, took more prizes than all the\r\nforeigners combined. Foreigners led in the number of prizes for textile\r\nfabrics, fine arts, and miscellaneous manufactures; and in the section\r\nof raw materials for food and manufactures the foreign exhibitors\r\ngained nearly four times as many prizes as the British.\r\n\r\nThis exhibition developed a number of features that should be borne in\r\nmind when considering those that came after it. It was an experiment\r\nin an untried field; it was comprised in a single building; and it was\r\nself-supporting. In all respects it was a marvelous achievement. It\r\nmade the late Prince Consort the “father,” and the Society of Arts the\r\npioneer promoters, of the international exposition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COURT OF HONOR FROM PERISTYLE.\r\n\r\n(World’s Columbian Exposition, Chicago, 1893.)]\r\n\r\nThe beneficial influence of the first world’s exhibition began to be\r\nfelt immediately. An exhibition of the arts and manufactures of Ireland\r\nwas held in Cork in the following year, and the Royal Dublin Society,\r\nwhich had been holding similar exhibitions triennially, got up a much\r\nlarger one than usual, through the generous pecuniary aid of William\r\nDargan, in 1853. The Dublin exhibition, unlike that of Cork, was\r\ninternational in scope.\r\n\r\nAmerican visitors to the London exhibition brought home with them a\r\npretty large inspiration for a similar effort, and before the close of\r\n1851 a number of citizens of New York had associated themselves for\r\nthat purpose. In January, 1852, the corporation of the city of New York\r\ngranted a lease for five years of Reservoir Square, on the conditions\r\nthat a building of iron, glass, and wood should be erected thereon,\r\nand that the entrance fee to the proposed exhibition should not exceed\r\nfifty cents. In March, the Legislature incorporated the Association\r\nfor the Exhibition of the Industries of all Nations, with a capital of\r\n$200,000 that might be increased to $300,000. Subsequently, the Federal\r\nGovernment constituted the building a bonded warehouse and exempted\r\nforeign exhibits from the payment of duties.\r\n\r\nThis exhibition was therefore a private enterprise, having no other\r\nofficial recognition than that mentioned. It was also an unfortunate\r\naffair from beginning to end. The location was then three or four\r\nmiles from the heart of the city; the area was entirely inadequate for\r\nthe purpose; the day of opening had to be postponed, because of the\r\nincomplete condition of the building; and financially the enterprise\r\nwas a huge failure.\r\n\r\nThe exhibition was opened July 14, 1853, with much ceremony, although\r\nstill scarcely half ready for exhibits or visitors, and was continued\r\nfor 119 days. There were about 4800 exhibitors, somewhat more than\r\none-half being foreign. The total cost of the exhibition was nearly\r\n$1,000,000, and the receipts were $340,000. Although a financial\r\nfailure, and a disappointment in many ways, this first international\r\nexhibition in the United States was productive of much good.\r\n\r\nThe success of the London exhibition also aroused the French to depart\r\nfrom the exclusively national character of their former exhibitions and\r\nto inaugurate one open to the world. This was done under the direct\r\nauspices of the Imperial Government, which undertook to combine certain\r\nfeatures of both the London and the New York enterprises; hence,\r\nthe first international exhibition held in Paris was practically a\r\nprivate scheme supported by official guarantees. A further departure\r\nwas here made in the matter of building, and, instead of the single\r\ngreat structure, there were the Palais de l’Industrie, the Palais des\r\nBeaux Arts, the Panorama, and three smaller buildings for agricultural\r\nimplements, carriages, and a variety of less costly articles. Another\r\ninnovation was here introduced, a partial return to the methods of the\r\ncommercial fair, in the setting apart of exhibiting spaces on the open\r\nground.\r\n\r\nThe main building, the Palais de l’Industrie, was erected by a\r\njoint-stock company on the Champs Elysées, and provided a floor space\r\nof 1,770,000 square feet. It was built of glass, stone, and brick, and\r\nwas 800 feet long by 350 feet wide. The various buildings cost about\r\n$5,000,000, and the Palais de l’Industrie was erected for a permanent\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nThis exhibition was opened on May 15, 1855, and closed on November 15,\r\nfollowing. It was visited by 4,533,464 persons. Besides France and her\r\ncolonies, fifty-three foreign states and twenty-two colonies belonging\r\nto them sent exhibits. In all there were 20,839 exhibitors, those of\r\nFrance and her colonies predominating by only about 500. The exhibits\r\nwere classified on the London plan, there being in each case thirty\r\nclasses altogether. Excluding the main building, which the Imperial\r\nGovernment acquired, the exhibition cost about $2,250,000.\r\n\r\nBetween the first and second London exhibitions there were many\r\nindustrial and art displays in the United Kingdom and colonies and on\r\nthe Continent, among which should be noted those of New Brunswick and\r\nMadras in 1853, Munich in 1854, and Edinburgh and Manchester in 1857.\r\n\r\nThe second London exhibition was undertaken by a commission headed, as\r\nthe first, by the Prince Consort, under a guarantee fund of $2,250,000.\r\nWhile it was in course of preparation the Prince Consort died, and\r\nfor a while a heavy pall hung over the scheme. The commission here\r\nintroduced the French idea of separate buildings. The site was at South\r\nKensington, and the main structure was built of brick, glass, and\r\niron, was nearly rectangular in shape, and covered an area of about\r\nseven acres. With the annexes the total area under roof was about\r\ntwenty-three acres.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WOMAN’S BUILDING.\r\n\r\n(World’s Columbian Exposition, 1893.)]\r\n\r\nThis exhibition was opened by the Duke of Cambridge on May 1, 1862,\r\nand remained open for 177 days. It was visited by 6,211,103 persons, a\r\ndaily average of 36,329, its receipts were wholly absorbed by expenses,\r\nand a slight deficit was left. Foreign exhibitors numbered 17,861, and\r\nreceived more than 9000 prizes.\r\n\r\nIn 1863 the French Government announced that an exhibition would\r\nbe held in Paris in 1867, that was intended to be more completely\r\nuniversal in character and more comprehensive in plan than any that had\r\never been held. The Champ de Mars, the great parade-ground on which the\r\nEcole Militaire faced, containing about 111 acres, was placed at the\r\ndisposal of the commissioners by the Government. In the centre of this\r\nspace was erected the principal building, an oval structure mainly of\r\niron, 1607 feet long and 1246 feet wide, that cost $2,357,000.\r\n\r\nIn planning this building the convenience of exhibitors and visitors in\r\nready access to the exhibits of any desired country or class was given\r\nthe preference over architectural effect. Here, again, was a diffusion\r\nof exhibits in detached buildings, and a noteworthy novelty was the\r\nreservation of ground on the park surrounding the main building for the\r\nerection by foreign exhibitors of special buildings for the display of\r\narticles that could not be accommodated in the main structure. This\r\nfeature became the most popular one of the entire exhibition, for it\r\ngave a most graphic illustration of the architecture, manners, customs,\r\nand countless peculiarities of the peoples of the world.\r\n\r\nThe exhibition was opened by the Emperor on April 1, 1867, and was\r\nclosed on October 31, following. The number of visitors was upward\r\nof 15,000,000, a daily average of nearly 70,000, and of exhibitors,\r\n51,819. In all, 12,944 medals and grand prizes of honorable mention\r\nwere awarded. From beginning to end the expenses were $4,596,764,\r\nand the receipts aggregated $2,822,000. The national and municipal\r\ngovernments contributed $1,200,000 each, which added to the receipts of\r\nthe exhibition proper created a surplus over expenditure of $626,000.\r\n\r\nLondon’s third exhibition, from May 1 till September 30, 1871, was\r\nprojected as the first of an annual series that should separately\r\npromote a distinct branch of industrial effort. Thirty-three foreign\r\ncountries were represented; there were approximately 4000 art and 7000\r\nindustrial exhibitors; and the visitors numbered 1,142,000. The second\r\nin the series, in 1872, was confined to printing, paper, music, musical\r\ninstruments, jewelry, cotton goods, and fine arts; and the third, in\r\n1873, was devoted to the general subject of cookery.\r\n\r\nGreat as was the universal exposition of Paris in 1867, that at Vienna\r\nin 1873 far surpassed it in extent and grandeur, although its pecuniary\r\nsuccess was severely affected by an epidemic of cholera, a financial\r\ncrisis, and local extortions. As each of the preceding international\r\nexhibitions had developed a distinctive feature, so this of Vienna\r\nintroduced the custom of holding world’s congresses for the discussion\r\nof great problems of universal application.\r\n\r\nThe exhibition was opened on May 1 and closed on November 3, following.\r\nTurnstiles recorded the entrance of 7,254,687 visitors. There were\r\nabout 70,000 exhibitors, whose display, in extent and costliness,\r\nexceeded that of Paris in 1867. The gross receipts were about\r\n$2,000,000, and expenditures about $9,850,000, making a deficiency of\r\nsome $7,850,000, which the Government liquidated. The United States\r\nwas represented by 643 exhibitors, more than half of whom were awarded\r\nprizes.\r\n\r\nThis brings the record up to the Centennial Exposition, at\r\nPhiladelphia, in 1876, and covers the third quarter of the century.\r\nThe actual work of making the Centennial Exhibition began on March 3,\r\n1871, when Congress passed an Act creating the United States Centennial\r\nCommission. This authorized the President to appoint a commissioner and\r\nan alternate from each State and Territory, on the nomination of the\r\nrespective governors. The appointments were promptly made, and from the\r\nwhole body of commissioners the following were chosen for the principal\r\nexecutive officers: President, Joseph R. Hawley, of Connecticut;\r\nVice-Presidents, Alfred T. Goshorn, of Ohio, Orestes Cleveland, of\r\nNew Jersey, John D. Creigh, of California, Robert Lowry, of Iowa, and\r\nRobert Mallory, of Kentucky; Director-General, Alfred T. Goshorn;\r\nSecretary, John L. Campbell, of Indiana; Assistant Secretary, Dorsey\r\nGardner; Counselor and Solicitor, John L. Shoemaker.\r\n\r\nDetails of organization and management were vested in an Executive\r\nCommittee. On June 1, 1872, Congress passed an Act creating the\r\nCentennial Board of Finance, with large powers. This Board estimated\r\nthat the cost of the exhibition would be $10,000,000, and apportioned\r\nshares of capital stock for this amount among the several States\r\nand Territories, on the basis of population. Subsequently, a Board\r\nof Revenue was appointed and vested with authority to collect\r\nsubscriptions and other funds.\r\n\r\nDespite the financial panic of the summer of 1873, preparations\r\nprogressed so favorably that on July 3 President Grant issued a\r\nproclamation reciting that the one-hundredth anniversary of the\r\nindependence of the United States would be celebrated by holding an\r\ninternational exhibition of arts, manufactures, and the products of the\r\nsoil and mine, in Philadelphia, in 1876, opening April 19 and closing\r\nOctober 19, and inviting the nations of the world to take part in both\r\nthe celebration and the exhibition. In response to a formal invitation\r\nissued by the Secretary of State, thirty-two foreign governments sent\r\nfavorable replies for themselves and their colonies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AGRICULTURAL BUILDING.\r\n\r\n(Atlanta Exposition, 1895.)]\r\n\r\nThe city of Philadelphia placed at the disposal of the commissioners\r\na tract in Fairmount Park, aggregating 236 acres, for the principal\r\nbuildings, and also made proportionately large allotments for the\r\nexhibition of livestock and agricultural implements.\r\n\r\nFive principal buildings were erected. The Main Exhibition Building was\r\nin the form of a parallelogram, 1880 feet long and 464 feet wide, with\r\nprojections at the centre of the longest sides 416 feet long, and at\r\nthe centre of the short ones 216 feet long. The building was erected\r\non piers of masonry, wrought-iron columns supporting wrought-iron\r\nroof trusses forming the superstructure, the sides of which for some\r\ndistance above the ground were finished between the columns with\r\npaneled brick work. This building covered 21.47 acres, had a floor\r\nspace of 936,008 square feet, and cost $1,600,000.\r\n\r\nThe Art Gallery and Memorial Hall, designed to be a permanent\r\nstructure, was erected on an eminence in the Lansdowne Plateau. It is\r\nbuilt of granite, glass, and iron, in the modern Renaissance style of\r\narchitecture, on a terrace several feet above the level of the Plateau,\r\nand cost $1,500,000. The dimensions are: length, 365 feet; width, 210\r\nfeet; height, 59 feet. From the centre of the structure rises a dome of\r\niron and glass, 150 feet in height, surmounted by a figure of Columbia\r\nwith outstretched hands. This building was erected by the State of\r\nPennsylvania, and is now used as a permanent art and industrial museum.\r\n\r\nMachinery Hall was 1402 feet long and 360 feet wide, with an annex\r\non the south side 210 by 208 feet, and the main building and annex\r\nhad together a floor space of 558,440 square feet, or nearly thirteen\r\nacres. The total cost was $792,000. Horticultural Hall, near the Art\r\nGallery, was built by the city of Philadelphia for permanent uses. It\r\nexhibits the Moorish architecture of the twelfth century, is 383 feet\r\nlong by 193 feet wide, and is 72 feet high to the top of the lantern.\r\nIts cost was $251,937. The Agricultural Building was erected of wood\r\nand glass, the ground plan showing a parallelogram 630 feet long by 465\r\nfeet wide, and a nave 826 feet long and 100 feet wide crossed by three\r\ntransepts, and cost about $356,000.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MACHINERY HALL.\r\n\r\n(Atlanta Exposition, 1895.)]\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy edifices were the United States Government Building,\r\n504 feet long by 300 feet wide, prepared to exhibit the various\r\nfunctions of the public service; the Women’s Pavilion, covering an\r\narea of an acre, and with its exhibits of woman’s handiwork from the\r\nfifteen leading nations of the world constituting the first display of\r\nthe kind ever attempted on a large scale; twenty-six buildings erected\r\nby State and Territorial governments; and many others put up by foreign\r\ngovernments or exhibitors. Before the exhibition closed there were more\r\nthan two hundred buildings on the ground.\r\n\r\nAn interesting feature of this exhibition was the observance of State\r\nDays, when the governors of the States, with their official staffs\r\nand a large following of citizens, made ceremonial visits and held\r\nreceptions in the several State buildings. There were also numerous\r\nother special days, when hosts of people united in a common interest,\r\nreligious, fraternal, social, military, aquatic, or educational, added\r\nthousands to the ordinary attendance.\r\n\r\nDuring the exhibition 9,910,966 persons entered the grounds, of whom\r\n7,250,620 paid the full rate of fifty cents, 753,634 paid twenty-five\r\ncents each, and 1,906,692 had free entry. The exhibition represented\r\nan outlay of all kinds and by all interests of about $20,000,000. The\r\nUnited States Government aided it with a loan of $1,500,000, which was\r\nrepaid; the State of Pennsylvania appropriated $1,000,000, and the city\r\nof Philadelphia gave $1,500,000. From every point of view it was an\r\nunqualified success.\r\n\r\nTwo years after the Centennial Exposition another one was held in\r\nParis, which not only exceeded all previous ones in that city in size\r\nand magnificence, but made an unprecedented display of works of art and\r\nliterature. On this occasion about one hundred acres were set apart for\r\nthe various buildings, the exhibitors numbered some eighty thousand,\r\nthe gross receipts were upward of $2,500,000, and 16,032,725 visitors\r\nwere registered.\r\n\r\nThe third world’s exhibition in the United States was held in New\r\nOrleans during the winter of 1884–85, and was planned to commemorate\r\nthe centennial of the first export of cotton from America. The\r\nconception was an outgrowth of the exposition in Philadelphia, and\r\nwas first carried out on a limited scale in Atlanta in 1881, and on\r\na larger one in Louisville in 1883. Under the belief that the cotton\r\ncentennial should be celebrated in the chief city of the cotton belt,\r\nthe National Cotton Planters’ Association joined heartily in the\r\nscheme suggested by Major E. A. Burke, of New Orleans, for a universal\r\nexhibition in that city, in which the great industry of the Southern\r\nStates should play the most prominent part. Congress aided the movement\r\nby an Act incorporating the World’s Industrial and Cotton Centennial\r\nExposition, and, further, made a loan of $1,000,000 and appropriated\r\n$300,000 for a Federal Building. Railroad and other corporations\r\nsubscribed for $500,000 in stock, the State of Louisiana appropriated\r\n$100,000, and the city of New Orleans contributed a similar sum for the\r\nerection of a permanent Horticultural Hall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WOMAN’S BUILDING.\r\n\r\n(Nashville Exposition, 1897.)]\r\n\r\nFormal invitations were sent out to all foreign governments by the\r\nState Department at Washington, commissioners were appointed for the\r\nseveral States and Territories, and the time of the exposition was\r\nfixed for December 1, 1884, to May 31, 1885. The site selected was the\r\nUpper City Park, an unimproved tract of 245 acres, and in its centre\r\nwas erected the Main Building, a structure built wholly of wood, 1378\r\nfeet long and 905 feet wide, and with a continuous roof principally\r\nof glass. The entire building covered a space of thirty-three acres.\r\nA Music Hall capable of seating 11,000 persons was constructed in\r\nthe centre of this building, and a Machinery Hall in the rear. An\r\nextension at the southern end, 570 by 120 feet, was devoted to mills\r\nand factories in operation, and at right angles with this extension was\r\na building given up to sawmills.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Building, planned for the exhibits of the United States\r\nGovernment and of the States, was 885 feet long by 565 feet wide, and\r\nin general style and construction conformed to the Main Building.\r\nHorticultural Hall, built of iron and glass, is 600 feet long, 100 feet\r\nwide in main structure, and has a central transept carrying out the\r\nextreme width to 194 feet. The Art Building, of corrugated iron and\r\nglass, stood nearly in front of the Main Building, and was 250 long by\r\n100 feet wide, with a rotunda 50 feet square in the centre. Two other\r\nnoteworthy buildings were erected by the Mexican Government, one in the\r\nstyle of a native hacienda, with an interior gallery for the display of\r\nhorticulture and bird-life; the other for native minerals. Excluding\r\nthose of Mexico, the various buildings covered an area of 2,673,588\r\nsquare feet, or sixty-two acres, and all buildings covered about\r\nseventy-six acres.\r\n\r\nAmong the special features of this exposition were the display of\r\nwoman’s work, under charge of Mrs. Julia Ward Howe; of the work of\r\nthe colored race, under charge of the late Blanche K. Bruce; of\r\nthe cultivation of cotton and manufacture of the fibre; and of the\r\ncultivation, harvesting, and preparation for market of rice and sugar.\r\n\r\nOn May 5, 1889, another universal exposition was opened in Paris. This\r\nwas also a commemorative one, marking the centennial of the French\r\nRevolution, and because of its political character only the United\r\nStates and Switzerland accorded it official recognition, although most\r\nof the European governments encouraged individual participation. The\r\nexposition, despite this feature, was a grand success because of its\r\nunusual extent and comprehensiveness and its distinctive features. This\r\nexposition cost $8,600,000, and had about 60,000 exhibitors and more\r\nthan 28,000,000 reported visitors, the greater number, of course, being\r\nFrench.\r\n\r\nThe making of the World’s Columbian Exposition, to commemorate the\r\ndiscovery of America by Columbus, began soon after the close of the\r\nCentennial Exposition in Philadelphia. It was at first proposed to\r\ncreate a permanent exposition, to be held in Washington in 1892, to\r\nillustrate the progress of North, Central, and South America, and a\r\nboard of promotion was organized. By 1889, however, a strong popular\r\nsentiment had been aroused for a more comprehensive display, and\r\ncitizens of Washington, New York, Chicago, and St. Louis vied with each\r\nother in pressing on a special committee of the United States Senate\r\nthe advantages of their respective cities. A certificate to the effect\r\nthat subscriptions to the amount of $5,000,000 had been made in Chicago\r\ndecided the controversy in favor of that city.\r\n\r\nOn April 25, 1890, Congress passed an Act giving a legal status\r\nto a World’s Columbian Exposition, to be held under the auspices\r\nand supervision of the United States Government, the organizing\r\ncorporation to guarantee the subscription of $10,000,000 and the\r\npayment of $500,000 before the national commissioners should officially\r\nrecognize the site offered by the corporation for the exposition. On\r\nDecember 24, following, President Harrison announced the forthcoming\r\nexposition, to be opened on May 1, 1893, and invited the nations of\r\nthe world to participate in it. Congress appropriated in various sums\r\na total of $3,238,250 in money and authorized the coining of 5,000,000\r\nsouvenir fifty-cent pieces in silver to be sold for the benefit of the\r\nexposition.\r\n\r\nThe management was vested in a National Commission of two\r\nrepresentatives of each State and Territory and of the District of\r\nColumbia, and eight from the country at large. The site was Jackson\r\nPark, on the shore of Lake Michigan, to which was added the Midway\r\nPlaisance tract of 80 acres, making an aggregate ground area of\r\n633 acres. On the main ground more than 150 noteworthy buildings\r\nwere erected. The Midway Plaisance was devoted to amusements and\r\nthe illustration of the manners and customs of the world. Here, the\r\nmost conspicuous of a multitude of great and curious objects was the\r\ngigantic revolving and passenger-carrying Ferris Wheel. All of the\r\nexposition buildings proper were constructed of wood, iron, and glass,\r\nin combination with a material known as “staff,” made by uniting\r\nplaster and jute fibre in water, in the form of a paste. As all\r\nexterior surfaces were painted white, the exposition grounds became\r\npopularly known as the White City.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ART BUILDING. EXACT REPRODUCTION OF THE PARTHENON.\r\n\r\n(Nashville Exposition, 1897.)]\r\n\r\nThe principal buildings, with their cost, were those of Manufactures\r\nand Liberal Arts, the largest of all, 1687 by 787 feet, $1,500,000;\r\nMachinery, $1,285,000; Fine Arts, $670,000; Agriculture, $618,000;\r\nAdministration, $435,000; Electricity, $401,000; United States\r\nGovernment, $400,000; Live Stock, $385,000; Transportation, $370,000;\r\nHorticulture, $300,000; Mines, $265,000; Fisheries, $224,000; Woman’s,\r\n$138,000; Forestry, $100,000; and a brick imitation of a modern United\r\nStates battleship, with complete armament and equipment, $100,000.\r\nForeign governments appropriated a total of $6,571,520 for their\r\nrespective buildings and exhibits, France leading with $650,000, and\r\nbeing followed by Japan, $630,000; Brazil, $600,000; Germany, $214,200;\r\nand Austria, $149,100; and the States and Territories, a total of\r\n$6,020,850. The entire cost of construction was $18,322,622.\r\n\r\nAccording to the original Act of Congress, the buildings then completed\r\nwere dedicated on Columbus Day, October 21, 1892, with prayer, music,\r\nand an oration by Chauncey M. Depew, and during that week a number\r\nof State buildings were also dedicated. The exposition was formally\r\nopened with exceedingly brilliant ceremonies on May 1, 1893, and was\r\nclosed with an entire lack of formality on October 30, following, in\r\nconsequence of the assassination of Carter Harrison, mayor of Chicago,\r\ntwo days before. Up to November 12, the receipts from all sources\r\naggregated $33,290,065, and the expenditures, $31,117,353. The total\r\nnumber of paid admissions, excluding those prior to the opening and\r\nafter the closing, was 21,477,218, and of all, 27,529,400; smallest\r\nsingle-day number, 10,791; largest, on “Chicago Day,” 729,203. In all\r\nthere were 65,422 exhibitors, and medals were awarded to 23,757 of\r\nthem, the jury examining and reporting on more than 250,000 separate\r\nexhibits.\r\n\r\nPresent space will only permit the briefest summarizing of this\r\ngreatest of all international expositions hitherto held,—matchless\r\nin extent, in completeness of composition, in grandeur of setting.\r\nA pleasing evidence of the influence the undertaking was expected\r\nto yield is found in the remarkably large number of international\r\ncongresses that were held during its progress. This feature alone\r\ncalled for 1245 separate sessions, at which there were 5974 speakers\r\nand a special attendance of more than 700,000 persons, chiefly adults.\r\nAlmost every conceivable branch of human thought and effort had its\r\nindividual congress. Particularly noticeable among these formal\r\ngatherings was the Parliament of Religions, in which Christian,\r\nProtestant, Catholic, Jew, and Buddhist expounded their doctrinal\r\nbeliefs and narrated the story of their sectarian progress and hopes.\r\n\r\nThe Cotton States’ and International Exposition, opened in Atlanta\r\non September 18, 1895, had its origin in two purposes: the first, to\r\ngive the industrial conditions of the Southern States a more adequate\r\ndisplay than they had at Chicago, owing to the constitutional inability\r\nof their Legislatures to appropriate public money for such a purpose;\r\nthe second, to promote larger trade relations between the South and the\r\nLatin-American republics and with Europe. It was set on foot by private\r\nenterprise, and received its largest official aid from the city council\r\nof Atlanta, which appropriated $75,000.\r\n\r\nPiedmont Park, a tract of 189 acres, two miles from the centre of the\r\ncity, and memorable because traversed by the rifle-pits over which\r\nGeneral Sherman threw shells into the city thirty-one years before, was\r\nselected as the site. In a natural dip of the ground an artificial lake\r\nwas constructed, covering thirteen acres, and around it the principal\r\nbuildings were erected. Not only the Southern, but many of the Northern\r\nand Western States aided the enterprise with special buildings and\r\nexhibits.\r\n\r\nOf the thirteen large buildings, that of the United States Government\r\noccupied the most conspicuous site. The Administration Building was\r\na reproduction of portions of Blarney Castle, the Tower of London,\r\nWarwick Castle, the Rheinstein in Germany, and St. Michael’s, on the\r\ncoast of Brittany. On a considerable elevation was the Auditorium, a\r\nfour-story building with a dome surmounted by a statue of Music. The\r\nlargest building was that devoted to Manufactures and Liberal Arts, and\r\nthe most original of all in design was the one set apart for Minerals\r\nand Forestry, which was constructed entirely of wood from the different\r\nSouthern States in its natural condition, with the bark on. The Fine\r\nArts and the Woman’s Buildings were the showiest, and the Negro\r\nBuilding was made attractive by specimens of the industry of negroes in\r\nfourteen States. The exposition was closed December 31, and cost about\r\n$2,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe international exposition at Nashville, open from May 1 to October\r\n30, 1897, was a commemoration of the one-hundredth anniversary of\r\nthe admission of Tennessee into the Union, and had for its special\r\nattraction a reproduction of a number of notable buildings of\r\nantiquity. The original plan provided for an exposition in 1896, the\r\ntrue centennial year, but the projectors encountered unusual opposition\r\nin their efforts to procure the necessary funds, and it was not till\r\nearly in 1897 that the incorporators were able to begin the creation of\r\nthe Centennial City.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRAND COURT, OMAHA EXHIBITION, 1898.\r\n\r\n(Night view.)]\r\n\r\nWest Side Park, a former race-course in the suburbs of Nashville, with\r\nmany natural attractions in running water and forest growths, was\r\nselected as the site, and Centennial City was made for the brief time\r\nof the exposition a full-fledged municipality, with a mayor, board of\r\naldermen, and a combined police and fire department. The reproduction\r\nof notable buildings showed on a reduced scale the Parthenon, the\r\nPyramid of Cheops, the Alamo of Texas, the Blue Grotto of Capri, a\r\nglimpse of the Rialto of Venice, and, in the beautiful main entrance, a\r\ntype of early Egyptian architecture. A flagstaff 250 feet high, cotton\r\nand tobacco fields, Venetian gondolas, Vanity Fair, a typical Chinese\r\nfarm, an abundance of statues of classical and mythological subjects,\r\nwaterfall and old-time wheel at work, Lake Katherine, Ellen Island,\r\nthe umbrella fountain, and a large field for athletic sports, were\r\namong the pleasurable features. The State made a strong showing of its\r\nindustrial development and of its riches yet in reserve.\r\n\r\nIn all 190 acres of ground were occupied. The total receipts were\r\n$1,087,227, and the expenditures balanced to a cent. A unique expense\r\nfeature was that, excluding the preliminary work, the women raised the\r\nmoney and paid the entire running cost of the Woman’s Department. The\r\nturnstiles registered 1,886,714 entrances.\r\n\r\nThis exposition was succeeded in 1898 by the Trans-Mississippi and\r\nInternational Exposition at Omaha, an undertaking designed to show what\r\nhad been accomplished by the pioneers and their children in the great\r\nTrans-Mississippi Valley, and especially in a State that forty-three\r\nyears before was an unorganized territory in the vast tract known\r\nas the Louisiana Purchase. The site was a plateau just north of the\r\ncity, and in planning the display every consideration was given to\r\noriginality. Excepting that the grounds constituted a second White\r\nCity, from the use of “staff,” as at Chicago, every feature of design\r\nand construction possessed striking elements of difference from all\r\nsimilar efforts in the past.\r\n\r\nThe management was under the presidency of Gurdon W. Wattles, and the\r\nexposition was formally opened by President McKinley, who, in the White\r\nHouse at Washington, pressed an electric button that started the great\r\nengine. The United States Government erected a building of the classic\r\nstyle, following the Ionic order. It was surmounted by a colossal dome\r\nsupporting a copy of Bartholdi’s statue of “Liberty Enlightening the\r\nWorld,” and had a floor space for exhibits of about 50,000 square feet.\r\nThe Government also recognized the importance of the event by issuing\r\na special set of commemorative postage stamps. Fine arts was exhibited\r\nin a twin-domed building, a structure in two parts, with an elaborate\r\nperistyle between them, and all under one great roof.\r\n\r\nWhat afforded the masses the greatest delight were the ethnological\r\nexhibits and the instructive and amusing scenes on the Midway Reserve.\r\nThese included an Indian village, with representatives from every\r\ntribe between Alaska and Florida, a Chinese village, an Arabian\r\nencampment, a Moorish town, a Swiss village, a Cairo street, the\r\nentertaining Egyptian Pyramid, and the gigantic passenger-carrying\r\nSherman Umbrella—a mechanical marvel operated by electricity, and one\r\nhundred feet higher than the Ferris Wheel of Chicago. There was also a\r\npicturesque lagoon or canal, half a mile long and 150 feet wide at its\r\nnarrowest part, terminating in an artificial lake trefoil in shape and\r\n400 feet across.\r\n\r\nThe exposition was opened on June 1 and was closed on October 31. In\r\nthat time it was visited by more than 2,600,000 people, the largest\r\nsingle-day attendance being 98,785. The total receipts were not quite\r\n$2,000,000, and the expenditures were about $1,500,000.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAIN BUILDING, NATIONAL EXPORT EXPOSITION, PHILADELPHIA,\r\nSEPT. 14 TO NOV. 30, 1899.]\r\n\r\nThis completes the record of the most notable expositions and the\r\nincidental history of their development, from the commercial fair of\r\nthe previous century up to near the close of 1899.\r\n\r\nThere remains to note a form of permanent exhibition that has been\r\npurposely reserved for this point. The Commercial Museum, of which\r\nPhiladelphia has the two most effective examples in existence, is a\r\npurely commercial development, yet an educational text-book of unique\r\nand extraordinary compass. Though the Philadelphia Commercial Museum\r\nand the similar department of the Philadelphia Bourse were both\r\nprojected before the foreign trade of the United States had reached the\r\nenormous volume that caused wonder and alarm alike all over the world,\r\nboth have had a powerful, direct, and immediate influence in bringing\r\nabout a greater appreciation abroad of American products.\r\n\r\nThe commercial museums stand between the American producer and the\r\nforeign factor. They inform the former where special articles are\r\nneeded and the latter of reputable firms who can supply their needs. By\r\na large corps of traveling agents, an enormous correspondence, and a\r\ndirect coöperation with the State Department and its representatives,\r\nthese museums keep in the closest possible touch with the commercial\r\ninterests of the world. All this is independent of the exhibition\r\nfeature, a vast department in which the principal economic productions,\r\nfirst of the United States and then correspondingly of the world, are\r\nspread before the eye of the visitor. In this connection should also be\r\nnoted the fact that many of our commercial representatives abroad have\r\nestablished at their headquarters collections of American products that\r\nare particularly needed in their respective localities.\r\n\r\nIn all of the foregoing a single text has been kept in mind: What has\r\nbeen the influence of the fair, the exhibition, the international\r\nexposition? Ready answers have been suggested by the several items of\r\ncost and attendance. Another answer may be divined in their frequency\r\nand universality. And at the close of this survey of more than a\r\nhundred years, probably the best answer of all is to be found in the\r\nefforts in this line with which one century is closed and another\r\nopened.\r\n\r\nThese include the Greater American Exposition at Omaha, July-November,\r\n1899, a commercial success, and a revelation of trans-Mississippi\r\npioneering enterprise. This was supplemented by the Export Exposition\r\nand World’s Commercial Congress, the first of the kind ever held under\r\nthe joint auspices of the Commercial Museum and the Franklin Institute\r\nof Philadelphia, in that city, in September-November, 1899. Then\r\nfollowed the Universal Exposition in Paris, in 1900. It was regarded as\r\nespecially elaborate and successful. It beautified the Champ de Mars\r\nand Place des Invalides with handsome industrial palaces, brought into\r\npermanent existence the two Palaces of Fine Arts and the Alexander III.\r\nBridge, lined the banks of the Seine with the “Street of Nations,” and\r\nswarmed the Trocadero with the world’s colonization. Over 50,000,000\r\nwitnessed its panoramic scenes. Its expense was largely provided for\r\nby prior sales of tickets on a bonded plan. The century turned with a\r\nprospective of the Pan American Exposition at Buffalo and International\r\nat Glasgow in 1901; the Ohio Centennial and International at Toledo in\r\n1902; the International at Liege, Belgium, in 1903; and the Louisiana\r\nPurchase Centennial at St. Louis in 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CENTURY’S PROGRESS IN COINAGE, CURRENCY, AND BANKING\r\n\r\nBY HON. BRADFORD RHODES,\r\n\r\n_Editor of “Banker’s Magazine.”_\r\n\r\n\r\nI. BANKS AND BANKING RESOURCES.\r\n\r\nThe history of nation building contains no parallel to the progress and\r\ndevelopment of the United States in the past one hundred years, and the\r\nmost accurate and striking indication of this remarkable growth may\r\nbe seen in the evolution of our currency and banking systems. As the\r\nvariations in temperature and the changes in atmospheric pressure are\r\nmeasured by the thermometer and barometer, so are the fluctuations in a\r\ncountry’s wealth gauged by the banks and other financial institutions.\r\nLikewise the degree of civilization to which a country has attained is\r\nreflected by the perfection of its monetary machinery. After having\r\ntried nearly every unwise experiment condemned by the teachings of\r\nhistory, the United States has finally reached a position where its\r\ncurrency meets the two fundamental requirements of sound finance,\r\nnamely, (1) the standard of value is that in use among the great\r\ncommercial states of the world; (2) all of the currency is either\r\ndirectly or indirectly convertible into the standard coin.\r\n\r\nDespite some minor faults in our financial system which make the\r\nmaintenance of the parity of the several kinds of currency a cumbersome\r\nand expensive operation, and prevent the banks from rendering that\r\nfull degree of assistance to commerce and industry which they would\r\nafford under laws that did not unnecessarily restrict their rightful\r\nfunctions, all our money responds to the two essential tests—safety\r\nand convertibility; while the banks have been among the most powerful\r\nfactors in placing the United States in the front rank of the nations\r\nof the earth.\r\n\r\nOur finances may be likened to a triangle, of which the base—the gold\r\nstandard—has been in actual existence since 1879 (much longer than\r\nthat in law), and the other side—safety—also assured, wanting but\r\nanother addition—elasticity—to complete the symmetrical and perfect\r\nfigure. That this last requisite of a sound currency will be supplied\r\nby the wisdom and ingenuity of our people, is not to be doubted.\r\n\r\nThere are two respects in which the financial policy of the United\r\nStates is unique in comparison with most other great commercial\r\ncountries; first, its gold reserve is unprotected by the devices in\r\nuse elsewhere, as it does not charge a premium on gold as the Bank of\r\nFrance does when gold is wanted for export, nor can it protect the gold\r\nreserve by raising the rate of discount as the great banks of Europe\r\nmay do; second, banking is practically free and anti-monopolistic.\r\nUnder these conditions we have reached a place that may well excite the\r\nastonishment of the old-world countries. Our stock of metallic money,\r\nas estimated by the Director of the Mint, in 1898, was $925,000,000 in\r\ngold and $638,000,000 in silver. No other nation owned so much gold.\r\nOnly one—China—owned as much silver, but it had no gold, and the per\r\ncapita of silver in China is only $1.96 against $8.56 in the United\r\nStates. Our stock of gold is more than double that of Great Britain,\r\ngreater by a hundred millions than that of France, and also exceeds\r\nthat of Germany and Russia. Of our silver stock, $561,500,000 is a full\r\nlegal tender, and $76,700,000 a limited legal tender, the latter sum\r\nrepresenting the subsidiary coins.\r\n\r\nIn our banking power the situation is equally fortunate. Mulhall\r\ndefines banking power as the paid-up capital of banks, the deposits\r\nexclusive of savings banks, and the amount of convertible paper money.\r\nHe shows the growth of this form of wealth to have been as follows,\r\nfrom 1840 to 1894:—\r\n\r\nMILLIONS POUNDS STERLING.\r\n\r\n  ----+----------+--------+---------+----------+--------+-------\r\n      |  Great   | United | France. | Germany. | Other  | Total.\r\n      | Britain. | States |         |          | States |\r\n  ----+----------+--------+---------+----------+--------+-------\r\n  1840|   132    |    90  |    16   |    12    |   58   |   308\r\n  1894|   960    | 1,030  |   356   |   231    |  760   | 3,337\r\n  ----+----------+--------+---------+----------+--------+-------\r\n\r\nIn the two great essentials of financial strength—the quantity of\r\nmetallic money and banking power—we have far outstripped every other\r\nnation. This is an unfailing sign of our advance toward a position of\r\ncommercial and industrial supremacy. The sceptre of financial power has\r\ncrossed the Atlantic from Europe to the New World. We are gradually\r\nacquiring command of the world’s markets, and in time we shall see\r\nour banks—ever the handmaids of commerce—extending their operations\r\nto the most distant quarters of the earth and carrying everywhere the\r\nbeneficent influences of modern civilization.\r\n\r\nNew York as a financial centre has been growing with astonishing\r\nrapidity in recent years. From 1879 to 1899 the banks belonging to\r\nthe New York Clearing-House Association increased their deposits from\r\n$254,700,000 to $910,500,000, and their specie—chiefly gold—from\r\n$54,700,000 to $202,600,000, the latter item having about doubled in\r\nthe past two years, being $104,700,000 in 1897, and $202,600,000,\r\nas above stated, in 1899. The aggregate of banking institutions in\r\nthe city—national banks, state banks, trust companies, and savings\r\nbanks, exclusive of private banking firms—had, about January 1, 1899,\r\ncapital, surplus, and profits amounting to $311,600,000; deposits of\r\n$2,047,800,000; and total resources of nearly $2,500,000,000. One\r\nbank—the National City—with over $144,000,000 of deposits, is the\r\nlargest in the United States; while the Bowery Savings Bank, with\r\n121,000 depositors and $67,000,000 of deposits, is the largest of its\r\nkind in the country.\r\n\r\nThe present status of the different classes of banks in the United\r\nStates is fairly shown by the following table compiled from the Annual\r\nReport of the Comptroller of the Currency, for the year 1898:—\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL ITEMS OF RESOURCES AND LIABILITIES OF ALL CLASSES OF BANKS IN\r\nTHE UNITED STATES, JULY 14, 1898.\r\n\r\n  --------------------+--------------+-------------+------------+-\r\n                      |   National   | State Banks.|Loan & Trust|\r\n                      |    Banks.    |             | Companies. |\r\n  --------------------+--------------+-------------+------------+-\r\n  Loans               |$2,151,757,655| $813,749,803|$539,162,445|\r\n  United States bonds |   285,356,900|    4,185,304|  34,186,440|\r\n  Other bonds         |   250,689,375|  127,500,484| 159,791,312|\r\n  Cash                |   492,882,724|  133,877,133|  22,250,862|\r\n  Capital             |   622,016,745|  233,587,353| 101,228,555|\r\n  Surplus and profits |   332,971,643|  109,554,519|  97,643,666|\r\n  Deposits            | 2,076,226,576|  912,365,406| 662,138,397|\r\n  Total resources     | 3,977,675,445|1,356,084,800| 942,462,179|\r\n  --------------------+--------------+-------------+------------+-\r\n\r\n  --------------------+--------------+-----------+--------------\r\n                      |   Savings    |  Private  |    Total.\r\n                      |    Banks.    |   Banks.  |\r\n  --------------------+--------------+-----------+--------------\r\n  Loans               |$1,070,775,293|$57,206,819|$4,632,632,015\r\n  United States bonds |   140,029,726|    927,473|   464,685,843\r\n  Other bonds         |   834,670,491|  3,599,092| 1,376,250,754\r\n  Cash                |    32,928,323|  5,857,132|   687,796,174\r\n  Capital             |    18,536,130| 16,721,750|   992,090,533\r\n  Surplus and profits |   187,475,971|  5,092,341|   732,738,140\r\n  Deposits            | 2,028,208,409| 62,085,084| 5,741,023,872\r\n  Total resources     | 2,241,344,991| 91,436,387| 8,609,003,802\r\n  --------------------+--------------+-----------+--------------\r\n\r\nThere were 3582 national banks that reported, and 5903 other banks, a\r\ntotal of 9485. The total banking funds, that is, capital, surplus and\r\nprofits, and individual deposits, of all banks reporting, amounted to\r\n$7,416,355,568.\r\n\r\nWe cannot get a correct understanding of these figures without going\r\nback to earlier dates and making comparisons. In 1798 there were\r\ntwenty-five state banks in the country, against 3965 reporting to the\r\nComptroller of the Currency in 1898, which is perhaps about 90 per cent\r\nof the total of such institutions now existing.\r\n\r\nA hundred years ago the capital of the state banks was less than twenty\r\nmillions, compared with $233,971,643 now reported. They had, all told,\r\nbut $14,000,000 of specie—half as much as is now held by one New York\r\ncity bank alone. Their circulation was only $9,000,000, compared with\r\nmore than $200,000,000 of national bank circulation now outstanding.\r\n\r\nThe national banks also show a remarkable growth. In 1869 there were\r\n1620 banks in operation, reporting $420,800,000 capital, $547,900,000\r\nindividual deposits, $17,500,000 specie, and $1,517,700,000 total\r\nresources. Thirty years later the number of banks had increased to\r\n3590, while the capital was $608,300,000, the individual deposits\r\n$2,232,100,000, and specie $371,843,400, while the total resources had\r\nincreased to $4,403,800,000.\r\n\r\nThe total wealth of the United States in 1895 was estimated at more\r\nthan $80,000,000,000,—far exceeding in the aggregate that of any other\r\ncountry in the world. It is expected that the census of 1900 will show\r\nour total wealth to be more than $100,000,000,000, or probably double\r\nthat of Great Britain, the next richest nation.\r\n\r\nBut while the nation is piling up wealth at an unexampled rate, it\r\ncannot be said that this is a land “where wealth accumulates and\r\nmen decay.” Great in its material resources, the country was never\r\nbefore stronger in those elements which constitute the chief reliance\r\nof national power. A united citizenship, possessing an honesty that\r\nadversity cannot sully and an intelligence that when once aroused\r\npenetrates the most cunningly concealed economic sophistries, working\r\nout the problems of the future under laws and conditions assuring to\r\nthe individual the largest opportunities, points to a development in\r\nthe twentieth century in no wise inferior to that of the hundred years\r\npreceding.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. COINAGE AND PRODUCTION OF PRECIOUS METALS.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing systems of coinage in this country and among all great\r\ncommercial nations are the result of development and growth. Gold and\r\nsilver have become the principal money metals by a process of natural\r\nselection, which has chosen the instruments best suited to the purpose.\r\nIn recent years, and under the laws of development, nearly all the\r\ngreat trading countries of the world have selected gold as the standard\r\nof value. In the future, gold itself may give way to something better,\r\nfor it only relatively meets the essentials of a perfect standard.\r\n\r\nAmong Greeks, Romans, and Oriental peoples, cattle were generally used\r\nas a standard of value. The modern rupee of India is the old Sanscrit\r\nword _roupa_, a herd. Capital is but the estimate of Roman riches in\r\ncattle. The Latin _pecus_, cattle, is the root of _pecunia_, riches,\r\nand the origin of our word pecuniary. The Icelanders measured values\r\nin dried fish; the Hudson Bay country in skins; the early Virginians\r\nin tobacco; the Indians of the United States and Canada in wampum; the\r\nChinese, even in recent times, in squares of pressed tea; the Africans\r\nin bars of salt and slaves.\r\n\r\nThese primitive devices gradually gave way, under the demands of\r\ninternational trade, to the use of metals as standards of value. Tin,\r\ncopper, gold, silver, and iron all were used, and, at first, passed by\r\nweight. Government coinage of money is thought to date from the seventh\r\ncentury B. C., and is credited to the Lydians and to Pheidon of Argos,\r\nthe official stamp being a guarantee of the honesty, weight, and purity\r\nof the coins.\r\n\r\nModern coinage dates from the reformation of the coinage of Rome under\r\nConstantine, who introduced the gold _solidus_ of $3.02 in value,\r\nand a silver coin of like weight but of relative value. After the\r\ntime of Julian, this silver piece, called _siliqua_, was given such\r\nvalue as that twenty-four of them equaled a gold _solidus_. In the\r\nFrankish Empire, under the Merovingian kings, the relative values of\r\nthe _solidus_ and _siliqua_ fluctuated greatly. In the eighth century,\r\non account of the scarcity of gold, there was a gradual transition\r\nto the silver standard, and a silver unit, also called a _solidus_,\r\nwas substituted for the gold _solidus_, the former being divided into\r\ntwelve pence. This silver _solidus_ afterwards became the shilling of\r\nEngland and Germany. At first 300 pence were coined out of a pound of\r\nsilver; but under Pepin the number was reduced to twenty-two _solidi_\r\nof twelve pence each—264 pence—out of a pound of silver. Under\r\nCharlemagne it was provided that only 240 pence, or twenty _solidi_ of\r\naccount, should be stamped out of a pound of silver, and this system\r\nwas introduced, with more or less success, in what is now France and\r\nGermany. As to form, it has remained, up to the most recent period, the\r\nbasis not only of the countries of Charlemagne’s Empire but of England.\r\n\r\nAfter the time of Henry VIII. came a period of coinage debasement\r\nwhich culminated in 1551. A thorough coinage reform was effected under\r\nElizabeth in 1560. The first large coinages of gold in England were\r\nmade under James I. These continued until the death of William III.,\r\nin 1701. Still, silver continued to be the standard metal, and in\r\n1695 another attempt was made to reform the currency by a recoinage\r\nof the silver pieces, most of which had been clipped or worn, into a\r\nnew full-weight silver coin. These, however, were soon exported, in\r\nspite of a reduction of the current value of the guinea, in 1717. The\r\ngold standard in England gained a nearly complete victory by act of\r\nParliament in 1774, which provided that silver coins not of full weight\r\n(there were hardly any others) need not be accepted in payments of\r\nmore than twenty-five pounds, except by weight. This provision, after\r\nseveral renewals, became permanent in 1798. In 1797 coinage of silver\r\nwas suspended, and the single gold standard practically introduced,\r\nthough its operation was somewhat interfered with by the existence\r\nof a paper currency. In 1816 the present English monetary system was\r\nintroduced. It held fast to the gold standard, by the provision that\r\nsilver pieces should be used only as divisional coins, and with a\r\nlegal-tender power limited to forty shillings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD UNITED STATES MINT, PHILADELPHIA.]\r\n\r\nProperly speaking, there was no coinage in the United States during the\r\ncolonial period. Maryland had a mint at one time, and one or two of the\r\nother States, but they practically amounted to nothing. In the early\r\ncolonial period the substitutes for coins were wampum and bullets,\r\nas in Massachusetts; skins and furs, as in New York; tobacco, as in\r\nMaryland and Virginia. The coins in use before the Revolution were,\r\nto some extent, those of England, but more largely those of Spain,\r\ncirculated in South America and traveling up to the United States.\r\nThe unit of account was the Spanish milled dollar or piece-of-eight,\r\nthough, up to 1775, accounts were kept in pounds, shillings, and pence,\r\na pound consisting, then as now, of twenty shillings, and a shilling\r\nof twelve pence “colonial” or “pound” currency. Four pounds of this\r\n“colonial currency” were reckoned as equal to three pounds sterling.\r\n\r\nThis colonial composite system of current coins was regulated by\r\ncoinage tariffs. Such a tariff, issued in 1750, valued one ounce of\r\nsilver at six shillings and eightpence, the Spanish milled dollar at\r\nsix shillings, the guinea at twenty-eight shillings, and the English\r\ncrown at six shillings and eightpence. All foreign coins were valued\r\nin proportion to the value of the Spanish piece-of-eight. Some of the\r\ncolonies stamped the shilling, which constituted a large part of the\r\nmoney in circulation. It, however, varied greatly in value in the\r\ndifferent colonies. Thus, the Spanish dollar equaled five shillings\r\nin Georgia; eight in North Carolina and New York; six in Virginia,\r\nConnecticut, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island; seven\r\nand sixpence in Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey;\r\nthirty-two and sixpence in South Carolina. The Spanish dollar itself,\r\nwith which these comparisons were made, was frequently below legal\r\nweight, and, therefore, varied in value. Where the pieces mentioned in\r\nthe tariff of 1776 were of full weight, the ratio there established was\r\nthe English ratio of one to 15.21, the ratio for bullion being nearly\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\nAfter the tariff of 1776 had been in operation for six years, the\r\ncolonies began to feel keenly the difficulties caused by the variety of\r\ncoins constituting their metallic circulating medium, and the need of\r\na special American coinage was frequently expressed. In 1782, Robert\r\nMorris, superintendent of finance, submitted to the Congress of the\r\nConfederation a scheme for a national coinage and the establishment\r\nof an American mint, which met with approval. Jefferson recommended\r\nthe decimal system, with the dollar as the unit. Neither of these\r\nproposals was carried into effect till, in 1786, the Congress of the\r\nConfederation chose as the monetary unit of the United States the\r\ndollar of 375.64 grains of pure silver, which unit had its origin in\r\nthe Spanish piaster or milled dollar, then the basis of the metallic\r\ncirculation of the English colonies in America. This American dollar\r\nwas never coined, there not being at the time a mint in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe Act of April 2, 1792, established the first monetary system of\r\nthe United States. The bases of the system were: The gold dollar,\r\ncontaining 24.75 grains of pure gold, and stamped in pieces of $10,\r\n$5, and $2.50, denominated respectively eagles, half-eagles, and\r\nquarter-eagles; the silver dollar, containing 371.25 grains of pure\r\nsilver. A mint was established. The coinage was unlimited, and there\r\nwas no mint charge. The ratio of gold to silver in coinage was 1:15.\r\nBoth gold and silver were legal tender. The standard was double.[4]\r\nThe Act of 1792 undervalued gold, which was therefore exported. The\r\nAct of June 28, 1834, was passed to remedy this by changing the\r\nmint ratio between the metals to 1:16.002. The latter act fixed the\r\nweight of the gold dollar at 25.8 grains, but lowered the fineness\r\nfrom 0.916⅔ to 0.899225. The fine weight of the gold dollar was thus\r\nreduced to 23.2 grains. The Act of 1834 undervalued silver as that\r\nof 1792 had undervalued gold, and silver was attracted to Europe by\r\nthe more favorable ratio of 1:15½. The Act of January 18, 1837, was\r\npassed to make the fineness of the gold and silver coins uniform. The\r\nlegal weight of the gold dollar was fixed at 25.8 grains, and its fine\r\nweight at 23.22 grains. The fineness was therefore changed by this act\r\nto 0.900 and the ratio to 1:15.988+. Silver continued to be exported.\r\nThe Act of February 21, 1853, reduced the weight of the silver coins\r\nof a denomination less than $1, which the Acts of 1792, 1834, and 1837\r\nhad made exactly proportional to the weight of the silver dollar,\r\nand provided that they should be legal tender to the amount of only\r\n$5. Under the Acts of 1792, 1834, and 1837 they had been full legal\r\ntender. By the Act of 1853 the legal weight of the half dollar was\r\nreduced to 192 grains, and other fractions of the dollar in proportion.\r\nThe coinage of the fractional parts of the dollar was reserved to the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n    [4] This was true so far as the law was concerned, but\r\n        not actually, as may be seen by reading the sentences\r\n        immediately following the above statement.\r\n\r\nThe Act of February 12, 1873, provided that the unit of value of the\r\nUnited States should be the gold dollar of the standard weight of\r\n25.8 grains, and that there should be coined besides the following\r\ngold coins: A quarter-eagle, or two and-a-half dollar gold piece; a\r\nthree-dollar gold piece; a half-eagle, or five-dollar piece; an eagle,\r\nor ten-dollar piece; and a double eagle, or twenty-dollar piece, all of\r\na standard weight proportional to that of the dollar piece. These coins\r\nwere made legal tender in all payments at their nominal value when not\r\nbelow the standard weight and limit of tolerance provided in the act\r\nfor the single piece, and when reduced in weight they should be legal\r\ntender at a valuation in proportion to their actual weight. The silver\r\ncoins provided for by the Act were a trade dollar, a half-dollar or\r\nfifty-cent piece, a quarter-dollar, and a ten-cent piece, the weight\r\nof the trade dollar to be 420 grains troy; the half-dollar, twelve and\r\na half grams; the quarter-dollar and dime, respectively, one half and\r\none fifth of the weight of the half-dollar. The silver coins were made\r\nlegal tender at their nominal value for any amount not exceeding $5 in\r\nany one payment. Owners of silver bullion were allowed to deposit it\r\nat any mint of the United States to be formed into bars or into trade\r\ndollars, and no deposit of silver for other coinage was to be received.\r\nSection 2 of the joint resolution of July 22, 1876, recited that the\r\ntrade dollar should not thereafter be legal tender, and that the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury should be authorized to limit the coinage of\r\nthe same to an amount sufficient to meet the export demand for it.\r\n\r\nThe Act of March 3, 1887, retired the trade dollar and prohibited\r\nits coinage. That of September 26, 1890, discontinued the coinage of\r\nthe one-dollar and three-dollar gold pieces. The Act of February 28,\r\n1878, directed the coinage of silver dollars of the weight of 412½\r\ngrains troy, of standard silver, as provided in the Act of January 18,\r\n1837, and that such coins, with all silver dollars theretofore coined,\r\nshould be legal tender at their nominal value for all debts and dues,\r\npublic and private, except where otherwise expressly stipulated in the\r\ncontract. The Secretary of the Treasury was authorized and directed\r\nby the first section of the act to purchase from time to time silver\r\nbullion at the market price thereof, not less than $2,000,000 worth\r\nnor more than $4,000,000 worth per month, and to cause the same to be\r\ncoined monthly, as fast as purchased, into such dollars. A subsequent\r\nact, that of July 14, 1890, enacted that the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nshould purchase silver bullion to the aggregate amount of 4,500,000\r\nounces, or so much thereof as might be offered, each month, at the\r\nmarket price thereof, not exceeding $1.00 for 371.25 grains of pure\r\nsilver, and to issue in payment thereof Treasury notes of the United\r\nStates, such notes to be redeemable by the government, on demand,\r\nin coin, and to be legal tender in payment of all debts, public and\r\nprivate, except where otherwise expressly stipulated in the contract.\r\nThe act directed the Secretary of the Treasury to coin each month\r\n2,000,000 ounces of the silver bullion purchased under the provisions\r\nof the act into standard silver dollars until July 1, 1891, and\r\nthereafter as much as might be necessary, to provide for the redemption\r\nof the Treasury notes issued under the act. The purchasing clause of\r\nthe Act of July 14, 1890, was repealed by the Act of November 1, 1893.\r\nThe War Revenue Act of June 13, 1898, authorized and directed the\r\ncoinage of standard silver dollars to the amount of not less than one\r\nand one half million dollars a month, from the bullion in the Treasury\r\npurchased under the Act of July 14, 1890. The Act of June 9, 1879,\r\nmade the subsidiary silver coins of the United States legal tender to\r\nthe amount of $10. The minor coins are legal tender to the amount of\r\ntwenty-five cents.\r\n\r\nThe following official figures give, by periods of ten years, the\r\ncoinage of the United States from the establishment of the Mint to the\r\npresent time:—\r\n\r\n  -------------+-----------------+---------------+--------------+-\r\n     Years.    |      Gold.      |    Silver.    |     Minor.   |\r\n  -------------+-----------------+---------------+--------------+-\r\n  1793–1799    |      $696,530.00|  $1,216,158.75|    $50,111.42|\r\n  1800–1809    |     3,067,067.50|   3,154,687.75|    164,865.79|\r\n  1810–1819    |     2,348,915.00|   6,107,903.75|    162,534.07|\r\n  1820–1829    |     2,579,017.50|  14,787,327.65|    178,372.70|\r\n  1830–1839    |    17,745,422.50|  28,112,136.60|    334,810.21|\r\n  1840–1849    |    58,909,439.00|  22,223,733.00|    360,840.33|\r\n  1850–1859    |   352,915,059.00|  47,238,813.00|  1,135,580.03|\r\n  1860–1869    |   290,786,131.00|  13,637,607.90|  8,504,070.00|\r\n  1870–1879    |   370,718,883.50| 142,196,178.60|  2,231,009.50|\r\n  1880–1889    |   411,766,277.00| 305,869,081.20|  8,127,305.56|\r\n  1890 to June |   374,806,225.00| 136,248,501.65|  7,564,849.65|\r\n      30, 1897 |                 |               |              |\r\n  -------------+-----------------+---------------+--------------+-\r\n               |$1,886,338,958.00|$720,792,129.85|$28,814,558.26|\r\n  -------------+-----------------+---------------+--------------+-\r\n\r\n  -------------+-----------------\r\n     Years.    |      Total.\r\n  -------------+-----------------\r\n  1793–1799    |    $1,962,800.17\r\n  1800–1809    |     6,386,621.04\r\n  1810–1819    |     8,619,561.82\r\n  1820–1829    |    17,544,717.85\r\n  1830–1839    |    46,192,369.31\r\n  1840–1849    |    81,494,012.33\r\n  1850–1859    |   401,289,443.03\r\n  1860–1869    |   312,927,808.90\r\n  1870–1879    |   515,146,071.60\r\n  1880–1889    |   725,762,663.76\r\n  1890 to June |   518,619,576.30\r\n      30, 1897 |\r\n  -------------+-----------------\r\n               |$2,635,945,646.01\r\n  -------------+-----------------\r\n\r\nAt this writing the report of the Director of the Mint has not been\r\npublished, but the coinage for the full year 1897 may be stated as\r\nfollows: gold, $76,028,484; silver, $18,486,697; and for the year 1898,\r\ngold, $77,985,757; silver, $23,034,034. From January 1 to June 30,\r\n1899, the coinage was: gold, $65,915,020; silver, $12,780,441.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes thought that the silver dollars are not a full legal\r\ntender, but this is not so. They are an unlimited legal tender for all\r\ndebts, public and private. The Treasury does not, in practice, redeem\r\nsilver dollars in gold, but successive Secretaries of the Treasury have\r\nannounced their readiness to do so, if necessary to keep the silver\r\ndollars from depreciating,—that is, preserve their parity,—which the\r\nlaw directs.\r\n\r\nSilver certificates and gold certificates are not legal tender, but\r\nentitle the holder to receive the kind and amount of coin named on\r\ntheir face.\r\n\r\nThe value of gold bullion in a dollar of that metal is 99.991125\r\ncents, or practically 100 cents. The value of the silver bullion in a\r\ndollar of that metal is about 45 cents. It varies, however, with the\r\nfluctuations in the market value of silver.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that the bullion value of a silver dollar and\r\nof a gold dollar differs greatly, but the equality of the purchasing\r\npower of the two coins is due to the fact that the silver dollars are\r\nreceivable for public and private debts, that they are indirectly\r\nexchangeable for gold, by depositing them in the banks, and that the\r\ngovernment is pledged to redeem them in gold, if necessary to preserve\r\ntheir parity with gold.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEW UNITED STATES MINT, PHILADELPHIA, PA.]\r\n\r\nAs early as 1826 the United States began to export domestic gold,\r\nbeginning with an export of $1,056,088 of gold coin and bullion,\r\nand receiving an import of $678,740. Up to 1897 the grand total of\r\nexports of gold coin and bullion amounted to $2,186,238,541, and the\r\ntotal imports to $1,112,138,766, an excess of exports over imports of\r\n$1,074,099,775. In 1898 the imports of gold coin and bullion into the\r\nUnited States were $120,391,674, and the exports $15,406,391, making\r\nthe net imports $104,985,283.\r\n\r\nFrom 1821 to 1897 the grand total of exports of silver coin and\r\nbullion from the United States was $1,152,688,776, and the imports\r\n$730,325,881, making an excess of exports over imports of $422,362,895.\r\nIn the fiscal year 1898, the silver imports were $30,927,781, and the\r\nexports $55,105,239, making the excess of exports $24,177,458.\r\n\r\nThe total product of gold in the United States from 1792 up to 1896 was\r\n$2,113,034,769, and of silver $1,444,970,000, making a grand total of\r\nthe precious metals of $3,558,004,769. The total value of the entire\r\nworld’s production of gold, between the years 1493 and 1896, was\r\n$8,983,320,600, and of silver $10,556,700,800, making a grand total of\r\ngold and silver of $19,540,021,400.\r\n\r\nAs a comparison of the money status of the United States at the\r\nbeginning and end of the century, the following figures are\r\ninteresting: In 1800 the population was 5,308,483; the estimated bank\r\nnotes outstanding, $10,500,000; the estimated specie in the country,\r\n$17,500,000; the total money in the United States, $28,000,000;\r\nthe specie in the Treasury, $1,500,000; the money in circulation,\r\n$26,500,000; the amount per capita, $4.99. In 1898 the population was\r\n74,522,000; the total coin in the United States, including bullion in\r\nthe Treasury, $1,498,993,249; total paper money, $1,138,440,126; total\r\nmoney of all kinds, $2,637,433,375; coin, bullion, and paper money\r\nin the Treasury, $799,537,480; total circulation, $1,837,859,895;\r\ncirculation per capita, $24.66.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARPENTERS’ HALL, PHILADELPHIA.\r\n\r\n(First Site of First United States Bank.)]\r\n\r\nPerhaps no law relating to the coins and currency of the United States\r\nhas been so widely discussed, or has borne more directly on the\r\nattitude and influence of political parties than the Coinage Act of\r\n1873. This act grew out of a proposition to revise our coinage laws,\r\nmade by John Jay Knox to the Secretary of the Treasury, in April, 1870.\r\nMr. Knox, in his rough draft of a bill, provided for a silver dollar\r\nof 384 grains, to be a legal tender for sums not exceeding $5.00.\r\nThus, the standard silver dollar of 412½ grains was eliminated. It\r\ndid not appear in the bill as it passed the Senate, January 10, 1871,\r\nnor in that reported to the House, March 9, 1871. The bill underwent\r\nprotracted and thorough discussion, and on May 27, 1872, was passed\r\nin the House. As passed, it contained the original provision for\r\ncoining a silver dollar of the weight of 384 grains—twice the weight\r\nof the silver half dollar. These dollars were to be a legal tender\r\nfor amounts not exceeding $5.00. The Senate amended this House bill,\r\nby substituting a trade dollar of the weight of 420 grains for that\r\nof 384 grains, at the same time preserving the legal-tender limit of\r\n$5.00. In the amended form, it passed the Senate, January 17, 1873, and\r\nthe House, February 7, 1873, and became a law. It will be seen that\r\nthe standard silver dollar of 412½ grains was never in the bill, and\r\ncould not, therefore, have been secretly omitted, as was afterwards\r\ncharged. It was omitted from the first draft, and all through,\r\nbecause none were being coined, and those that had been coined were\r\nexported, the silver bullion in them being, at that time, worth more as\r\nbullion than coin. By joint resolution of Congress, approved July 22,\r\n1876, the trade dollars provided for in the act were deprived of their\r\nlegal-tender quality. It was supposed they would circulate in China,\r\nbut they proved useless even for that purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. EARLY BANKING IN THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nThe first banks in the United States owed their origin to Robert\r\nMorris and Alexander Hamilton. Morris, as early as 1763, conceived the\r\nplan of a bank to assist in developing American trade, and in 1779,\r\nHamilton proposed the organization of “The Company of the Bank of the\r\nUnited States.” These plans did not mature, but were followed, at the\r\nsuggestion of Thomas Paine, by an association of ninety-two subscribers\r\nto a fund of 300,000 pounds Pennsylvania currency to support the\r\nRevolutionary army. This association became known as the Pennsylvania\r\nBank. It commenced business July 17, 1780, and after a career of a\r\nyear and a half, during which time it greatly aided the government in\r\nfurnishing army supplies, its affairs were wound up.\r\n\r\nOn May 17, 1781, Hamilton presented the plan of a bank to Congress,\r\nwhich was to be truly national, and “created avowedly to aid the\r\nUnited States.” Its name was to be the Bank of North America, with a\r\nsubscription of $400,000 in gold and silver, and its notes, payable\r\non demand, to be receivable for duties and taxes in every State.\r\nCongress approved the plan, and Morris, then Superintendent of Finance,\r\npublished it, with an address showing its advantages to the government\r\nand people, then suffering from the ill effects of a depreciated\r\ncurrency.\r\n\r\nThe Bank of North America was organized November 1, 1781, and began\r\nbusiness January 7, 1782. It creditably fulfilled its mission “to aid\r\nthe United States,” and, after the expiration of its charter, became\r\na State institution. In 1864 it entered the national banking system,\r\nthough retaining its old name. This bank was followed by the Bank of\r\nNew York, which began business June 9, 1784, and by the Massachusetts\r\nBank, which began business July 5, 1784.\r\n\r\nFIRST UNITED STATES BANK.—This institution grew out of the\r\nrecommendations of Alexander Hamilton, and formed a part of his scheme\r\nof strengthening the public credit and bringing about a closer union of\r\nStates. His plan was incorporated into a bill which passed the Senate\r\nJanuary 3, 1791, and the House, January 20, 1791. Washington signed it\r\nFebruary 25, 1791. The bill was hotly opposed as unconstitutional by\r\nSecretary of State Thomas Jefferson, Attorney-General Edmund Randolph,\r\nand in general by representatives from the Southern States.\r\n\r\nThe capital of the bank was fixed at $10,000,000, one fifth of which\r\nwas to be subscribed by the government. The remainder was subscribed by\r\nindividuals, and two hours after the opening of the books the capital\r\nwas oversubscribed to the amount of 4000 shares. The central bank was\r\nlocated at Philadelphia, and afterwards branches were established in\r\nNew York, Boston, Baltimore, Washington, Norfolk, Charleston, Savannah,\r\nand New Orleans. Business was first opened in Carpenters’ Hall,\r\nPhiladelphia, December 12, 1791. In July, 1797, the site was removed\r\nto a new building on Third Street, below Chestnut, and it remained\r\nthere till the dissolution of the bank, with the exception of a brief\r\nremoval to Germantown in 1798, during the epidemic of yellow fever.\r\nThough this bank proved a profitable enterprise for the government, it\r\nfailed to secure a renewal of its charter in 1811, chiefly because so\r\nmany of its shares had passed into foreign hands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GIRARD BANK, PHILADELPHIA.\r\n\r\n(Second Site of First United States Bank.)]\r\n\r\nEARLY STATE BANKS.—From 1790 to 1811 the number of State banks\r\nincreased from four to eighty-eight; their circulation from $2,500,000\r\nto $22,700,000; their capital from $2,500,000 to $42,610,000. In the\r\nsame time the metallic circulation of the country rose from $9,000,000\r\nto $30,000,000. These banks failed to meet the monetary necessities\r\nof the War of 1812, and in 1814 practically all of them south of New\r\nEngland suspended specie payments. Their notes were poured out in\r\nall denominations from six cents upward, and, with coin redemption\r\nstopped, they depreciated rapidly. This led to great financial distress\r\nin 1818–1820, and to excessive bank failures. The seriousness of the\r\ngeneral situation, and the declining credit of the government, led to\r\nthe establishment of the second Bank of the United States.\r\n\r\nSECOND BANK OF THE UNITED STATES.—In October, 1814, Secretary Dallas\r\nlaid a report before Congress, in which he deprecated the uncertain\r\namount and value of the paper currency. “There exists,” he said, “at\r\nthis time no adequate circulating medium common to the citizens of\r\nthe United States. The moneyed transactions of private life are at a\r\nstand, and the fiscal operations of the government labor with extreme\r\ninconvenience.” He then recommended as the remedy the establishment of\r\na national banking institution. A bill, based upon Dallas’s plan for\r\nsuch an institution, failed of passage in the House in 1814, and again\r\nin 1815, though passed by the Senate. It was, however, finally passed\r\nin an amended form, but was vetoed by President Madison.\r\n\r\nOn December 24, 1815, Mr. Dallas laid before Congress another plan for\r\na national bank. A bill was framed authorizing such an institution,\r\nwith a capital of $35,000,000, $7,000,000 of which were to be\r\nsubscribed by the government, the central bank to be at Philadelphia,\r\nwith power to establish branches, payments to be made in specie at\r\nall times unless otherwise authorized by Congress. This bill passed\r\nboth Houses of Congress, and was signed by President Madison, April\r\n10, 1816. When the subscription books of this bank were closed, it was\r\nfound that the subscriptions fell short of the authorized $35,000,000\r\nby $3,000,000, which amount was taken by Stephen Girard.\r\n\r\nThe bank could not lend more than $500,000 to the government without\r\nauthority of Congress, was to be the fiscal agent of the Treasury, and\r\nto receive deposits of public moneys. No notes of a less denomination\r\nthan $5.00 were to be issued, and the penalty for refusing to pay\r\nnotes or deposits in specie on demand was twelve per cent per annum\r\nuntil paid. It began business January 7, 1817. Owing to the impending\r\nfinancial crisis and bad management, the bank verged rapidly toward\r\ninsolvency, but was resuscitated under the vigorous management of a\r\nnew president, Langdon Cheves, who was elected March 6, 1819. He was\r\nsucceeded by Nicholas Biddle in 1823, who was destined to see the fall\r\nof the great institution.\r\n\r\nThe national bank incurred the hostility of the State banks, which\r\ncalled it a monster because it refused to allow the notes of the local\r\nbanks to accumulate as deposits in its branches without redemption.\r\nVarious States passed discriminating laws against it. Jackson, in his\r\nmessage to Congress in 1829, attacked the constitutionality of the\r\nlaw establishing it, and charged that it had “failed in the great\r\nend of establishing a uniform and sound currency.” At this time the\r\nBank was an imposing institution with its capital of $35,000,000,\r\nits public deposits of six to seven million, its private deposits of\r\na like amount, its circulation of $12,000,000, its annual discounts\r\nof $40,000,000, its annual profits of over $3,000,000, its palatial\r\nestablishment in Philadelphia, its twenty-five branches throughout the\r\nUnion, its five hundred employees, its stock distributed through nearly\r\nall parts of the world, and its notes current at par at home and abroad.\r\n\r\nJackson’s message was not received favorably by Congress. His aversion,\r\nit was thought, was due rather to his belief that the Bank was his\r\nenemy than to any dislike of a national bank. The growing hostility\r\nbetween him and Henry Clay induced the latter to make the renewal of\r\nthe Bank’s charter a political issue. When the bill rechartering the\r\nBank was passed in July, 1832, Jackson vetoed it, charging, in the\r\nmain, that the Bank was a monopoly. This brought the question of the\r\nfurther existence of the Bank fully into the arena of politics, in the\r\npresidential election of 1832, with the “Hero of New Orleans” on one\r\nside, and on the other “monster monopoly,” “Old Nick’s money,” and\r\n“Clay’s rags.” Jackson won, and speedily decided to remove the public\r\ndeposits from the Bank. This decision precipitated a bitter war between\r\nJackson and Congress. But Jackson did not swerve from his purpose. By\r\n1835 it became apparent that the Bank could not secure a renewal of its\r\ncharter from Congress. As a confession of its defeat, and just thirteen\r\ndays before the expiration of its federal charter, the Bank obtained\r\nfrom the State of Pennsylvania, February 18, 1836, a charter for the\r\nUnited States Bank of Pennsylvania, for a period of thirty years. Shorn\r\nof its importance, in a restricted field, yet with enormous capital,\r\nit fell into large bond and stock investments of questionable value.\r\nIts troubles were aggravated by bad management. It suspended during the\r\npanic of 1837 and the next year, and again for the last time in 1841.\r\nBiddle resigned the presidency in 1840, and four years later died poor\r\nand broken-hearted. Thus perished what is sometimes called the third\r\nBank of the United States, its predecessor, the second Bank of the\r\nUnited States, having fallen a victim to political intrigue and loss of\r\nprestige. The shareholders lost their entire investment of $28,000,000,\r\nbut the circulating notes were all paid, and also the deposits. The\r\ngovernment got back its investment of $7,000,000, and made $6,093,167\r\nbesides, from its connection with the Bank.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECOND UNITED STATES BANK, PHILADELPHIA. NOW CUSTOM\r\nHOUSE.]\r\n\r\nSTATE BANKS AND INDEPENDENT TREASURY.—After the removal of deposits\r\nfrom the Bank of the United States, September 26, 1833, the public\r\nrevenues were deposited in selected State banks, sometimes called “pet\r\nbanks.” In 1836 eighty-eight State banks in twenty-four States held\r\npublic deposits to the amount of $49,377,986. As the State banks had\r\nthrown their influence against the national bank, they were rewarded\r\nby allowing them to use the public money intrusted to them as a basis\r\nof extending their loans and for enormous issues of their own notes.\r\nBanks were started for the sole purpose of issuing notes which they\r\ncould use in buying public lands. As a consequence the government lost\r\nheavily through the depreciation of these notes and the failure of\r\nthe banks. On July 11, 1836, the Secretary of the Treasury issued a\r\ncircular forbidding the receipt of anything but specie in payment for\r\npublic lands. This caused a run on the banks and aided in hastening\r\nthe financial crisis of 1837. An act of Congress of June 23, 1836,\r\nauthorizing the calling in of $37,468,859 of the public funds deposited\r\nin the State banks, for purposes of distribution, forced the suspension\r\nof specie payments by all such banks, with very few exceptions.\r\n\r\nThe unsatisfactory trial of both federal and State banks as custodians\r\nof the public funds led to the establishment of what became known as\r\nthe independent Treasury system, by which the government collects its\r\nmoney and keeps it in the hands of the United States Treasurer or\r\nsub-treasurers, making disbursements when required. An act putting this\r\nsystem into effect became law July 4, 1840, but was repealed the next\r\nyear. It was repassed August 6, 1846, and remained in operation until\r\nthe passage of the National Currency Act in February, 1863, which gave\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury the right to designate certain national\r\nbanks as depositories of public funds. There were in such banks, on\r\nFebruary 4, 1899, United States deposits amounting to $81,120,873,\r\nsecured by United States bonds belonging to the banks and deposited\r\nin the Treasury, amounting to $89,100,240. Prior to the adoption of\r\nthe national banking system the country had a somewhat disastrous\r\nexperience with what has been known as “wild-cat” banks. Many of\r\nthem were organized for the sole purpose of issuing notes they never\r\nintended to pay. While they were numerous and dangerous, it must be\r\nremembered that in a number of States the leading banks carried on only\r\na legitimate business, and State banks as they exist to-day compare\r\nfavorably in their management with the national banks.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. HISTORY OF THE LEGAL-TENDER NOTE.\r\n\r\nThe first act authorizing the issue of legal-tender notes, known\r\npopularly as greenbacks, was approved by President Lincoln, February\r\n25, 1862. It provided for the issue of $150,000,000 in notes, in\r\ndenominations of not less than $5.00. Holders of these notes could\r\ndeposit them with the United States Treasurer or assistant treasurers\r\nin any sum not less than $50.00, or any multiple thereof, and receive\r\nUnited States bonds bearing six per cent interest. The first notes\r\nwere issued March 10, 1862. An act authorizing a second issue of\r\n$150,000,000 was signed by the President, July 11, 1862. Of these\r\n$35,000,000 were to be in denominations of less than $5.00. A third\r\nissue of $150,000,000 was authorized March 3, 1863, but this act\r\ndeprived the legal-tender note of its convertibility into six per cent\r\nbonds at the option of the holder.\r\n\r\nThe withdrawal of this privilege worked no particular hardship at the\r\ntime, for bond issues and various interest-bearing certificates were\r\nplenty during the period of war. But after the war had closed and the\r\nissues of new securities had ceased, the absence of this provision\r\nbegan to prevent the absorption of the legal-tender notes.\r\n\r\nThe highest amount of legal-tender notes outstanding at any date was on\r\nJanuary 3, 1864, $449,338,902. Their depreciation was hastened by the\r\nissue of the short-time interest-bearing securities in large amounts.\r\nDuring 1862 the average gold premium was 113.3; during 1863, 145.2;\r\nduring 1864, 203.3. In July, 1864, this premium reached its highest\r\npoint, an average of 258.1.\r\n\r\nIn 1865 the country began to feel the necessity of a contraction of\r\nthe currency, with a view to as early a resumption of specie payments\r\nas the business interests would permit, and the Congress expressed\r\nthe public sentiment by an almost unanimous resolution. On March 12,\r\n1866, an act was approved calling for the retirement and cancellation\r\nof not more than $10,000,000 of legal tenders within six months, and\r\nthereafter not more than $4,000,000 during any one month. The effect\r\nwas to reduce the legal tenders outstanding on December 31, 1867, to\r\n$356,000,000.\r\n\r\nThis reduction, together with the rapid payment of notes of other\r\nclasses, used as currency, led to so sudden a contraction of the\r\ncirculating medium, and such stringency in the money market, that\r\nCongress, by act of February 4, 1868, prohibited the further reduction\r\nof the legal-tender notes. The amount outstanding, October 1, 1872, was\r\n$356,000,000, and on January 1, 1874, $382,979,815, the increase being\r\ndue to a construction on the part of secretaries of the Treasury to the\r\neffect that they had power to reissue retired notes which were held as\r\na reserve. On June 20, 1874, Congress enacted that the United States\r\nnotes outstanding and to be used as part of the circulating medium\r\nshould not exceed $382,000,000, and that no part thereof should be held\r\nor used as a reserve.\r\n\r\nAnother attempt was made in 1875 to reduce the aggregate of\r\nlegal-tender notes, preparatory to the resumption of specie payments.\r\nThe Resumption Act of January 14, 1875, authorized, among other things,\r\nthe retirement and cancellation of legal tenders till the amount\r\noutstanding should be reduced to $300,000,000; $35,318,984 were retired\r\nunder this law, but further reduction was prohibited by act of May 31,\r\n1878. The amount outstanding at that date was $346,681,016, and this\r\nhas continued to the present time, no new issues having been authorized.\r\n\r\nOn January 1, 1879, the resumption of specie payments took place as\r\nprovided in the act of January 14, 1875. At this latter date, the\r\nonly legal-tender coin recognized by law was the gold coin. But, in\r\nFebruary, 1878, the coinage of standard silver dollars was authorized,\r\nand they were to be a legal tender for all debts, unless otherwise\r\nexpressly stipulated in the contract. This led to the claim on the part\r\nof those who favored silver that the redemption of legal-tender notes,\r\nprovided for in coin in the act of 1875, could be effected by the use\r\nof silver dollars. But the general, and doubtless sound, construction\r\nof the law of 1875 has been that it was an express contract to redeem\r\nthe legal-tender notes in the coin then recognized as legal tender, and\r\nin no other; and so the Treasury has redeemed legal tenders since 1879,\r\nin gold, when the same is demanded.\r\n\r\nIn 1869 the United States Supreme Court, the bench not being\r\nfull, declared the acts authorizing legal-tender notes to be\r\nunconstitutional. But subsequently, the bench having its full quota\r\nof nine, the Court sustained the constitutionality of the acts, on\r\nthe ground, mainly, that they were a proper exercise of the war power\r\nvested in the Congress. In 1883 the Court decided that the reissues of\r\nthese notes, made in time of peace, were constitutional.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the resumption of specie payments there were\r\n$135,000,000 in gold and bullion on hand to provide for the redemption\r\nof such notes as might be presented. By Act of July 12, 1882, it was\r\nprovided that when the redemption reserve of gold coin and bullion in\r\nthe Treasury fell below $100,000,000, the issue of gold certificates\r\nshould cease. This is held to indicate that Congress regarded\r\n$100,000,000 as the limit below which the redemption reserve should not\r\nbe permitted to fall.\r\n\r\nIf this reserve had not been called upon to bear other burdens, there\r\nwould probably never have been any doubts as to its sufficiency. In\r\n1878, however, began the coinage of silver dollars and the issue of\r\nsilver certificates. These notes were kept at par in gold by their\r\ninterchangeability in the operations of commerce for legal-tender\r\nnotes. They were thus an indirect charge on the gold reserve. From 1878\r\nto 1890 they were increased at the rate of over $2,500,000 a month. In\r\nthat year (July 14, 1890) an act was passed providing for the issue of\r\nTreasury notes in the purchase of silver bullion, which provided also\r\nfor the coinage of some of the bullion purchased into silver dollars.\r\nThese Treasury notes were redeemable both in gold and silver, and as\r\nthe government never availed itself of its option to redeem in silver\r\nwhen gold was demanded for them, these notes as they were issued became\r\na further burden on the gold reserve provided for the legal-tender\r\nnotes.\r\n\r\nBy the beginning of the year 1893 the legal-tender notes, silver\r\ncertificates, and Treasury notes had reached an aggregate of nearly\r\n$800,000,000, all depending on the Treasury reserve for gold redemption.\r\n\r\nThis reduction of the percentage of gold held to the amount of the\r\ndemand liabilities raised doubts as to the ability of the government\r\nto maintain gold payments, and the legal tenders and Treasury notes\r\nwere presented for redemption. The depletion of gold was so great that\r\non one or two occasions there was danger that the reserve would be\r\nexhausted, and resort was had to the sale of bonds to procure gold to\r\nreplenish the reserve.\r\n\r\nThe issue of further Treasury notes was stopped by the repeal of the\r\nact of 1890 in November, 1893, and since this repeal confidence in the\r\nability of the Treasury to maintain gold redemptions has been gradually\r\nrestored.\r\n\r\nUnder the provisions of the Act of May, 1878, the legal-tender notes\r\nwhen redeemed cannot be canceled. They must be paid out again, and\r\ntherefore when reissued, they may again be presented for redemption.\r\nThis constitutes the so-called endless chain by which the gold in the\r\nTreasury is always liable to be drawn out.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. THE NATIONAL BANKING SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nThe desirability of perfecting the banking and currency system of the\r\ncountry was readily perceived on the breaking out of the Civil War in\r\n1861. Secretary Chase in two annual reports, those of 1861 and 1862,\r\nrecommended a system of national banks, whose supervision should be\r\nby national authority, and whose issues of notes should be based\r\non deposits of bonds of the government. After several unsuccessful\r\nattempts, a bill, introduced by Mr. Sherman, passed both Senate and\r\nHouse, and became a law February 25, 1863. This act embodied the\r\nessential features of Mr. Chase’s reports. Under it the first charter\r\nwas issued to the First National Bank of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThe formation of national banks proceeded very slowly at first. In\r\norder to hold out greater inducements for the State banks to enter the\r\nnational system, the act was amended on June 3, 1864. The first report\r\nof the Comptroller of the Currency, November 28, 1863, showed that\r\nonly 134 national banks had been organized up to that date; but when\r\nthe act of June 3, 1864, went into operation, new banks were formed\r\nmore frequently. A more rapid increase took place after the passage\r\nof the act of March 3, 1865, imposing a tax of 10 per cent on the\r\ncirculating notes of State banks. This increase was from 638 banks in\r\nJanuary, 1865, to 1513 in October of the same year; with an increase\r\nin capital of from $135,618,874 to $393,187,206; and in circulation of\r\nfrom $66,769,375 to $171,321,903. Prior to 1869 national banks were\r\nrequired to make their reports on fixed dates, but after March 3, 1869,\r\nthey were required by law to make their reports to the Comptroller five\r\ntimes a year on some past date fixed upon by the Comptroller.\r\n\r\nNATIONAL BANK LAWS AND REGULATIONS.—The national banks are under the\r\nsupervision of the Comptroller of the Currency, who is appointed by the\r\nPresident on the recommendation of the Secretary of the Treasury. His\r\nsalary is $5000 a year.\r\n\r\nA national bank may be organized by any number of persons not less\r\nthan five, on permission of the Comptroller. The capital required is\r\nnot less than $50,000 in any case, and this minimum applies only to\r\ntowns the population of which does not exceed 6000; in cities having\r\na population exceeding 50,000, the minimum capital is $200,000. For\r\nplaces having a population over 6000 and not exceeding 50,000, the\r\ncapital required is $100,000. One half of the capital must be paid in\r\nbefore the bank is authorized to begin business, and the remainder in\r\ninstallments of not less than 10 per cent on the entire amount of the\r\ncapital, as frequently as one installment at the end of each succeeding\r\nmonth from the time it is authorized to begin business. Capital stock\r\nis divided into shares of $100 each.\r\n\r\nThe banks are managed by a board of not less than five directors,\r\nchosen by the stockholders. Executive officers of the bank—president,\r\nvice-president, cashier, and assistant cashier—are chosen by the\r\ndirectors.\r\n\r\nShareholders are individually liable for the debts, contracts, and\r\nengagements of the bank to the extent of the amount of their stock\r\ntherein, at the par value, in addition to the amount invested in such\r\nshares. This is what is known as the double liability of shareholders,\r\nand is one of the features adding to the strength of the system.\r\n\r\nNational banks are designated by the Secretary of the Treasury to\r\nact as depositaries or custodians of public money. Such deposits are\r\nsecured specially by a deposit of United States bonds with the Treasury.\r\n\r\nAll national banks before commencing business are required to transfer\r\nand deliver to the Treasurer of the United States, as security for\r\ntheir circulating notes, United States registered bonds to an amount\r\nnot less than one fourth the capital where the capital is $150,000 or\r\nless, and to the amount of $50,000 where the capital is in excess of\r\n$150,000. These bonds must be taken by the banks whether they issue\r\ncirculation or not.\r\n\r\nCirculating notes are issued to national banks on a deposit of United\r\nStates bonds with the Treasurer. Notes are limited to 90 per cent of\r\nthe par value of the bonds, also to 90 per cent of the capital of the\r\nbank. They are over-secured, and no holder of them has ever lost a\r\ndollar by reason of the failure of a bank.\r\n\r\nThe notes are secured by the government bonds, there being a difference\r\nof the 10 per cent between the par of the bonds and the notes issued,\r\nand the bonds nearly always command a premium. They are further secured\r\nby the first lien on the assets of the bank, including the double\r\nliability of shareholders, by a 5 per cent redemption fund in the\r\nTreasury, and also by the margin between the capital and the amount of\r\nnotes permitted.\r\n\r\nNational bank notes are redeemable at the counters of the issuing banks\r\nand at the Treasury in “lawful money” of the United States. This term,\r\nas commonly used, means legal-tender money, and in practice, perhaps,\r\ngold coin or legal-tender notes.\r\n\r\nReserves of national banks are the amounts of money kept on hand to\r\npay their deposits and current checks and drafts. This reserve is to\r\nbe kept in lawful money,—gold and silver coin or certificates, and\r\nUnited States currency certificates or legal-tender notes. There are\r\nthree central reserve cities, namely, New York, Chicago, and St. Louis.\r\nNational banks in these three cities must keep a reserve of 25 per\r\ncent against their deposits, and this amount must be kept in their\r\nown vaults. There are twenty-four other reserve cities which are also\r\nrequired to keep a reserve of 25 per cent, but one half of that amount\r\nmay be due from other banks in New York and other central reserve\r\ncities, approved as reserve agents by the Comptroller of the Currency.\r\nBanks outside of these reserve cities must keep a reserve of 15 per\r\ncent, three fifths of which may be due from approved reserve agents in\r\nthe reserve cities or central reserve cities.\r\n\r\nIn times of panic when there is a run on banks they may use this\r\nreserve to pay their depositors, and it often happens that the reserve\r\nfalls below the amount required by law. Under such circumstances the\r\nComptroller may notify the banks to make good the deficiency; failing\r\nto comply with this request within thirty days, they may be closed.\r\n\r\nNational banks are not permitted to make loans on real estate.\r\nThe regulations prescribed by the law for the management of these\r\ninstitutions are very stringent, supplemented by a system of\r\nexamination and reports.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 the Comptroller of the Currency estimated that the government\r\nhad made a net profit of $157,439,248.98 out of the revenues derived\r\nfrom the national banks. It was estimated in the same report that the\r\naverage percentage of dividends paid to creditors of insolvent national\r\nbanks was 75 per cent. There have been no losses on circulation. In\r\n1878 the Comptroller estimated that the annual losses upon all the\r\ncurrency issued by State and private banks amounted to 5 per cent\r\nannually.\r\n\r\nThe national banks are not monopolistic. Any body of five reputable\r\ncitizens can form one by getting together $50,000 capital. The total\r\nshares of the national banks are approximately 300,000.\r\n\r\nProfits on national bank stock are not exorbitant. For a period of\r\ntwenty-nine years the net earnings on capital and surplus have been\r\nonly a little over 7 per cent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BOURSE, PARIS.]\r\n\r\nSince the establishment of the national banking system 5171 banks\r\nhave been organized, of which 1224 have gone into liquidation, 368\r\nhave become insolvent, and 3579 are in operation (February 4, 1899).\r\n\r\nThere is a marked falling off in the number of new national banks\r\norganized in recent years. In 1890 there were 307 organized, but in\r\n1898 there were only 50 organizations reported, and that was the\r\nhighest number reported since 1893. The capital of the national banks\r\nis also decreasing, but the deposits show a large increase.\r\n\r\nAt present the State banks are gaining in numbers more rapidly than the\r\nnational banks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BANK OF ENGLAND, LONDON.]\r\n\r\nPROFIT ON NATIONAL BANK CIRCULATION.—Many suppose that national banks\r\nmake an undue profit on the privilege they have of issuing notes to\r\ncirculate as money, based on a deposit of bonds with the United States\r\ntreasurer. Official figures disprove this. The total national bank\r\nnotes outstanding, February 4, 1899, was $203,636,184.50. The law\r\npermits these banks to issue notes to the extent of 90 per cent of\r\ntheir capital. This capital, on February 4, 1899, was $608,301,245.\r\nTherefore they might have had notes at issue on that date to the amount\r\nof $545,871,120.50, instead of only $203,636,184.50. This is conclusive\r\nevidence that there is no substantial profit in the issuing of such\r\nnotes.\r\n\r\nIn the figures furnished by the Comptroller of the Currency for 1898,\r\nhe shows that the profit which a national bank could make by taking out\r\ncirculation on a deposit of $100,000 of United States bonds, on October\r\n31, 1898, was less than 1 per cent. On that date eight leading banks\r\nhad no circulating notes at all out. The meagre profits of national\r\nbanks explain why they do not supply an adequate paper currency. The\r\nrestrictions on them make it impossible to render any substantial\r\nassistance to business in this respect. This is especially true in\r\ntimes of panic. Possessing gigantic strength, they are compelled to see\r\nthe industries of the country attacked by doubt and distrust, and are\r\nunable to go to their aid because of the restraints which forbid them\r\nto exercise their legitimate functions.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. FOREIGN BANKING AND FINANCE.\r\n\r\nMost foreign countries issue metallic money only, except those that are\r\non a paper basis. In general the paper currency is issued by banks,\r\nmany of which are more or less remotely associated with the government.\r\nSome of these banks issue notes on the security of the government or\r\nother stocks and bonds, while many emit notes based on no special form\r\nof security, but upon the general assets of the bank.\r\n\r\nAs compared with the United States there are but few banks in the\r\nprincipal foreign countries. England has less than one hundred;\r\nScotland less than a dozen; Canada but thirty-eight chartered banks. As\r\nin other foreign countries, the Canadian banks have numerous branches\r\naffiliated with the head office. National banks in the United States\r\nare prohibited from having branches. The Bank of France, the Bank of\r\nEngland, the Imperial Bank of Germany, the Austro-Hungarian Bank, the\r\nImperial Bank of Russia, are all more or less intimately associated\r\nwith their respective governments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GERMAN BANK, BREMEN.]\r\n\r\nThe Bank of England was incorporated by royal charter, July 27, 1694,\r\nits incorporators lending £1,200,000 to the government, in return\r\nfor which the Bank was permitted to issue notes to a like amount. It\r\nhad a practical monopoly up to 1826, and even now, it is believed,\r\nno bank within a radius of 65 miles of London may issue notes. It\r\nhas suspended specie payments more than once. In 1844, the banking\r\nand issue departments of the Bank were separated. One fifth of the\r\nreserve may be silver, though in practice the reserve is kept in gold\r\ncoin and bullion. Its notes are based on gold, except £16,800,000,\r\nwhich are secured by the government debt and other securities. It is\r\ncompelled to buy all gold offered at a fixed price, paying for it in\r\nnotes. So it must redeem all notes on demand in gold. When so redeemed\r\nthey are canceled and, after five years, burned. No notes of a less\r\ndenomination than five pounds are issued. The Bank checks gold exports\r\nby raising the rate of discount. The building covers about four acres of\r\nground, and employs over eleven hundred persons. It is the keystone of\r\nthe entire system of British credit, and commands the assistance of the\r\nGovernment when needed.\r\n\r\nThe Scotch banks issue notes on their own credit to the amount\r\noutstanding at the time of the passage of the Bank Act in 1844. Their\r\nrate of interest is said to be the same at all of their thousand\r\noffices. A unique feature of the Scotch banking system is that of cash\r\ncredits, by means of which a person of good credit may get his checks\r\ncashed without a deposit of actual money, the banks simply entering the\r\ncredits on their books.\r\n\r\nThe Bank of France has a monopoly of note issues, charges a premium on\r\ngold for export, and may redeem its notes in either gold or silver. The\r\nImperial Bank of Germany and a few other German banks issue notes on\r\ngold and other securities, and further amounts on their general credit.\r\nBeyond a fixed sum, called the emergency circulation, a tax of five per\r\ncent is levied. Other European banks are generally modeled on the same\r\nleading principle—a central bank of issue, with numerous branches, and\r\nassociated with the Government directly or indirectly. The Imperial\r\nBank of Russia issues notes practically covered by gold and redeemable\r\nin that coin. Japan tried a system of national banks combined with\r\nGovernment paper money, but is now substituting a system of bank notes\r\nissued by the Bank of Japan.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT DEBT SINCE 1857.\r\n\r\nIn 1857 the Government owed only $10,000,000 over and above the cash\r\nheld in the treasury. At the breaking out of the Civil War the debt had\r\nincreased to about $80,000,000. By August 31, 1865, it had increased\r\nto $2,756,000,000, with an interest charge of $150,000,000. In\r\ntwenty-eight years, down to June 30, 1893, the Government extinguished\r\n$1,917,500,000 of its debt, paid $2,364,000,000 for interest on its\r\ndebt, and $118,000,000 for premium on bonds redeemed, making a grand\r\ntotal of $4,400,000,000, or an annual average payment of $157,000,000\r\nfor the entire period.\r\n\r\nThe rise and fall of the public debt from July 1, 1857, to July 1,\r\n1898, appear more fully in the following table.\r\n\r\n  -----------------+---------------+------------------\r\n        Years.     |  Total debt.  | Debt less cash in\r\n                   |               |   the Treasury.\r\n  -----------------+---------------+------------------\r\n  1857, July 1     |   $28,699,831 |     $9,998,621\r\n  1860,  ”   1     |    64,842,287 |     59,964,402\r\n  1861,  ”   1     |    90,580,873 |     87,718,660\r\n  1862,  ”   1     |   524,176,412 |    505,312,752\r\n  1863,  ”   1     | 1,119,772,138 |  1,111,350,737\r\n  1864,  ”   1     | 1,815,784,370 |  1,709,452,277\r\n  1865, August 31  | 2,844,649,626 |  2,756,431,571\r\n  1873, July 1     | 2,234,482,993 |  2,105,462,060\r\n  1879,  ”   1     | 2,245,495,072 |  1,996,414,905\r\n  1889,  ”   1     | 1,619,052,922 |    975,939,750\r\n  1893,  ”   1     | 1,545,985,686 |    838,969,475\r\n  1895, December 1 | 1,708,871,670 |    948,477,612\r\n  1896, July 1     | 1,769,840,323 |    955,297,253\r\n  1897,  ”   1     | 1,817,672,665 |    986,656,086\r\n  1898,  ”   1     | 1,796,531,995 |  1,027,085,492\r\n  -----------------+---------------+------------------\r\n\r\nIn 1865 the annual interest charge on the public debt was $150,977,697.\r\nIn 1898 it was only $34,387,408.\r\n\r\nFrom 1791 to 1898 the gross receipts of the Government were\r\n$30,547,063,336.06 and the gross expenditures $29,768,597,237.24. The\r\nnet ordinary receipts, which do not include loans or proceeds from the\r\nissue of Treasury notes, were $405,321,335.20 for the fiscal year ended\r\nJune 30, 1898, and the net ordinary expenditures, which do not include\r\npayments on account of premiums or interest on the public debt, were\r\n$405,783,526.57.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. POSTAL SAVINGS BANKS.\r\n\r\nMany believe that a system of postal savings banks could be generally\r\nintroduced into the United States. Such banks doubtless appeal to those\r\nwho have more confidence in the Government than in any association of\r\nindividuals. Their safety may be conceded, for when the Government\r\nfails other institutions are likely to go the same way. But when\r\npeople deposit money in a postal savings bank, they make a loan to\r\nthe Government. This implies that the Government must be a perpetual\r\nborrower, whereas, until recent years, the United States has been a\r\ndebt-paying nation, and in the course of affairs may soon be again.\r\nUnless we are to have a large permanent debt, the deposits in postal\r\nsavings banks would have to be invested in general securities. Such\r\ninvestments could not well be made by the post-office officials of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIn Great Britain these banks have been in existence for about\r\nthirty-eight years, and their number has grown to about 12,000, with\r\nmore than 6,000,000 depositors. The system prevails in a number\r\nof other countries. The more concentrated and paternal system of\r\ngovernment prevalent in countries having these banks renders their\r\nmanagement a much less difficult problem than it would be in the\r\nUnited States with our large areas, vast number of post-offices, and\r\ngeneral diversity of conditions. In Great Britain the deposits in\r\nthe postal savings banks are made at the money order post-offices in\r\na pass book held by the depositor. Withdrawals are made by filling\r\nup blank forms, and these withdrawals may be made at any money order\r\npost-office. Deposits are invested in the public debt, and the rate of\r\ninterest is about two and one half per cent. The postal savings banks\r\nof Great Britain contain deposits approximating $527,000,000; those of\r\nFrance, $152,000,000; those of Italy, $90,000,000; those of Belgium,\r\n$67,000,000; those of Canada, $31,000,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. SAVINGS BANKS IN THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nThere are no worthier financial institutions in the country to-day\r\nthan the savings banks. Most of these are organized on what is known\r\nas the mutual plan. They have no capital, no stockholders, and all the\r\nassets are held in trust for the benefit of the depositors. They are\r\nmanaged by a board of trustees, who serve without pay. The investments\r\nwhich the banks are permitted to make are generally restricted to\r\nhigh-class securities insuring safety. The savings banks in New York\r\nState, especially, are closely restricted in investing their funds, and\r\nfailures in recent years are almost unknown. A deposit in one of these\r\nbanks is hardly less safe than an investment in Government bonds. The\r\nsavings banks are the primary schools of economy and thrift, and I\r\nbelieve that an extension of the mutual savings bank system throughout\r\nthe country, under proper legal safeguards, would be of the greatest\r\nbenefit to the people of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe deposits in banks of this kind are usually limited by law to\r\namounts not exceeding $3000 to one depositor, as they are not intended\r\nto be used by the wealthier class of people. The following statistics\r\nwill be found interesting.\r\n\r\nSAVINGS BANKS IN THE UNITED STATES, 1857–1897.\r\n\r\n(Statement of condition for each period of ten years.)\r\n\r\n  ---------------------+-----------+------------+------------+-\r\n                       |   1857    |    1867    |    1877    |\r\n  ---------------------+-----------+------------+------------+-\r\n  Number of banks      |        231|         371|         675|\r\n  Number of depositors |    490,428|   1,188,202|   2,395,314|\r\n  Amount of deposits   |$98,512,968|$337,009,452|$866,218,306|\r\n  Average to each      |           |            |            |\r\n    depositor          |        200|         283|         361|\r\n  ---------------------+-----------+------------+------------+-\r\n\r\n  ---------------------+--------------+--------------\r\n                       |     1887     |     1897\r\n  ---------------------+--------------+--------------\r\n  Number of banks      |           684|           980\r\n  Number of depositors |     3,418,013|     5,201,132\r\n  Amount of deposits   |$1,235,247,371|$1,939,376,035\r\n  Average to each      |              |\r\n    depositor          |           361|           372\r\n  ---------------------+--------------+--------------\r\n\r\nIn addition to the mutual and stock savings banks in the United States,\r\na system of school savings banks, introduced into the schools of the\r\nUnited States by J. H. Thiry, of Long Island City, N. Y., is worthy of\r\nmention. Such banks have been very successful in inculcating habits of\r\nthrift and economy among the children of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nX. THE CLEARING-HOUSE.\r\n\r\nA clearing-house may be defined as an institution for saving time,\r\nmoney, and labor. Its underlying principle is that of setting off one\r\nclaim against another.\r\n\r\nA bank in a large city receives every day in its mail a great number\r\nof checks or drafts drawn on banks in the same place. It does not\r\npresent these checks directly to the banks on which they are drawn\r\nfor payment, but sends them by messenger to the clearing-house. Let\r\nus say, for illustration, that the First National Bank presents to\r\nthe clearing-house checks on other banks amounting to $100,000. At\r\nthe same time the other banks send to the clearing-house checks they\r\nhave received drawn on the First National Bank, aggregating $75,000. A\r\npayment of $25,000 in money to the First National Bank will be all the\r\ncash required to pay checks representing $175,000. The economy in the\r\nuse of money is still better illustrated by the following statement of\r\nan actual transaction. On a day in the latter part of 1898 the Bank\r\nof the State of New York took to the New York Clearing-House checks\r\non other banks amounting to $15,647,583.82, and other banks brought\r\nchecks against it amounting to $15,647,401.85. The sum of these items\r\nwas $31,294,985.67, and they were paid with $181.97 in money, which\r\nrepresents the credit balance due to the Bank of the State of New York.\r\nThis instance shows what large transactions may be effected with small\r\nsums of money by employing proper banking machinery. Banks multiply the\r\nusefulness of money many fold.\r\n\r\nThe New York Clearing-House Association was organized September\r\n13, 1853, and the first clearing made by the Association took\r\nplace on October 11, 1853. The banks belonging to the New York\r\nClearing-House Association reported on April 1, 1899, loans and\r\ndiscounts, $779,951,100; deposits, $898,917,000; specie, $187,114,300;\r\ncirculation, $13,870,600.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEW YORK CLEARING-HOUSE.]\r\n\r\nCLEARING-HOUSE LOAN CERTIFICATES.—These are simply devices that the\r\nbanks have invented for use in times of panic. They are issued by a\r\ncommittee of the Clearing-House Association on the deposit of approved\r\nsecurities by the bank desiring them, and are used only to settle\r\nbalances between the banks. They are not money, but serve a useful\r\npurpose in diminishing the demand for money; for when the banks agree\r\nto accept these certificates among themselves, it makes that much money\r\navailable to be loaned or paid to depositors. In 1893, and in other\r\nyears of financial stringency, the issue of these certificates afforded\r\ngreat relief to business interests and saved the country from some of\r\nthe most disastrous results consequent upon such panics.\r\n\r\nThese certificates are not to be confounded with clearing-house gold\r\ncertificates issued by the Association on deposits of gold coin. They\r\nare used in making payments of balances between banks, and obviate the\r\nnecessity of frequently passing the actual coin from hand to hand.\r\n\r\nOn April 11, 1898, the clearings at the New York Clearing-House for\r\nthat day amounted to $352,882,567—the largest amount ever reported up\r\nto that time. The balances to be paid in money were $17,345,452, or\r\nonly about five per cent. For the year 1898 the bank clearings at New\r\nYork were $41,971,781,684, and for the whole country, $68,750,000,000.\r\n\r\nAn investigation of the amount of credit paper used respectively in the\r\nwholesale and retail trade was made by the Comptroller of the Currency\r\nin 1896. In his report for that year the Comptroller says: “From the\r\nface of the returns the conclusion to be drawn is that 67.4 per cent of\r\nthe retail trade of the country is transacted by means of credit paper\r\n(checks), that 95.3 per cent of the wholesale trade is so carried on,\r\n95.1 per cent of business other than mercantile, and 92.5 per cent of\r\nall business.”\r\n\r\n\r\nXI. PANICS AND THEIR CAUSES.\r\n\r\nA panic is generally due to inflation and speculation, and these, of\r\ncourse, have their origin in various sources not easily determined.\r\nAn unusual increase in the production of precious metals, bountiful\r\ncrops, a speculative craze taking possession of the public—such as\r\nthe tulip mania in Holland—all these and many other causes lead to\r\nspeculation. The fall in prices due to a stoppage in speculation brings\r\non the panic. Sometimes the catastrophe is produced by war or rumors\r\nof war, often by the most trivial circumstances, and not infrequently\r\nwithout any apparent cause. Before everybody had desired to buy; they\r\nnow became as eager to sell, and this rush to convert securities and\r\ncommodities into money precipitates a panic.\r\n\r\nCrises may be divided into commercial and financial. The last one in\r\nthe United States, whatever may have been its ultimate developments,\r\nwas in its inception and culmination essentially a financial panic. The\r\nTreasury and the banks were both regarded with more or less distrust.\r\n\r\nPanics or crises more or less severe have occurred in the United\r\nStates in 1814, 1818, 1826, 1837–39, 1848, 1857, during the Civil War,\r\n1861–65, 1873, 1882, 1884, 1890, 1893. Some of these should hardly\r\nbe called panics, as they were mere local disturbances. Different\r\ncauses have been given for each of these revulsions. Overtrading and\r\nspeculation were doubtless responsible for them. The panic of 1857\r\nwas coincident with large net imports of merchandise. On August 24,\r\n1857, the onward wave of prosperity, which had been steadily rising\r\nto a great height, received a check by the failure of the Ohio Life\r\nInsurance and Trust Co., followed by numerous other failures. On\r\nOctober 4 every bank in New York, except the Chemical, suspended specie\r\npayments, and they did not resume until December 12.\r\n\r\nThe speculation in gold in 1869 culminated in what is known as the\r\nBlack Friday panic, September 24, 1869. Fiske and Gould were conducting\r\na speculation in gold, and sought to corner it. They forced the price\r\nup to a high figure, but the Government suddenly appeared as a seller\r\nof gold and broke the “corner.”\r\n\r\nThe year 1873 witnessed another revulsion of confidence and another\r\ndisruption of the commercial and financial affairs of the country.\r\nBusiness had long been unduly expanded, and the collapse finally\r\ncame. The failure, on September 18, of the honored firm of Jay Cooke\r\n& Co., which had not only been identified with the building of the\r\nNorthern Pacific R. R. but had been a strong supporter of the credit\r\nof the Government when it was in the direst distress, was the first\r\nbad news. House after house fell. The Stock Exchange closed its doors\r\non September 20, and did not reopen them until September 30. More\r\nthan fifty Stock Exchange firms suspended, and several of the leading\r\nbanking institutions of New York and other cities had to stop business.\r\n\r\nDuring this panic the New York Clearing-House Association issued\r\nclearing-house certificates to those of its members who needed\r\navailable funds, and during the trouble issued $24,915,000 of them. In\r\nMay, 1884, it issued $24,915,000; in the 1890 panic, $16,645,000; in\r\n1893, $41,490,000.\r\n\r\nFollowing the resumption of specie payments the times were good for\r\nseveral years. The production of the precious metals was averaging\r\n$75,000,000 or more per year. From 1879 to 1883 we imported about\r\n$190,000,000 of gold. Railroad construction reached a higher point\r\nthan was ever recorded, either before or since, nearly 40,000 miles of\r\ntrack having been laid in five years. All seemed well, when another\r\ncollapse came in May, 1884. This was preceded by the failure of\r\nGrant & Ward, and it was followed by the failure of the Marine and\r\nthe Metropolitan Ranks. The disclosures of bad faith on the part of\r\nmen occupying positions of great trust, made the 1884 panic one of\r\ndistinct characteristics of its own. The previous activity in all\r\nlines of enterprise may have made the revulsion timely, but individual\r\ndishonesty greatly aggravated the situation.\r\n\r\nThe panic of 1890, in the United States, was but a reflection of the\r\ngreat Baring failure in London in the fall of that year. This crash\r\nwas due to South American speculations, and was one of the greatest\r\nfailures of modern times. It is the opinion of many well-informed\r\nfinanciers that this was one of the causes which operated to produce\r\nthe panic of 1893 in the United States. The course of the United\r\nStates in regard to the purchase of silver, doubts as to the tariff,\r\ndeficiency in revenues—all, perhaps, had their share in creating\r\ndistrust. But back of these were the conditions superinduced by an era\r\nof inflation and speculation. The 1893 panic bore most heavily upon the\r\nbanks. There was a continued demand upon the Treasury for gold, and the\r\ndeposits in banks were withdrawn so rapidly that hundreds of failures\r\nensued. The period of depression continued for nearly three years, and\r\nhas been succeeded by an era of general prosperity, which it is hoped\r\nmay be long continued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CENTURY’S PROGRESS IN FRUIT CULTURE\r\n\r\nBY H. E. VAN DEMAN,\r\n\r\n_Late Prof. of Horticulture, Kansas State Agricultural College_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest histories of civilization we learn that the\r\ncultivation of fruits has been a delightful pastime and also a\r\nsubstantial means of living. Their tempting colors, fragrant perfumes\r\nand luscious flavors are unequaled in combined attractiveness and\r\nsatisfaction to the human senses by anything else among all the\r\nproducts of nature. Their juices are at once appetizing, nutritious,\r\nand wholesome. Millions of people have subsisted upon them largely,\r\nfrom time out of mind.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, not a matter of wonder that our forefathers, when\r\nthey came to the shores of this New World, brought with them seeds,\r\ncuttings, and plants of the best fruits they had at their old homes.\r\nThus it was that the apple, pear, peach, plum, cherry, grape, olive,\r\ndate, almond, European walnut and chestnut, and many other less\r\nvaluable fruits were first cultivated in North America.\r\n\r\nTHE BEGINNING.—Previous to the beginning of the nineteenth century\r\nthere had been considerable development in fruit culture in the\r\ncolonies. Small apple orchards were quite common in the settlements,\r\nfrom New England to the Carolinas. The pear, peach, plum, grape, and\r\na few other fruits were cultivated in less degree. The Spanish had\r\nintroduced the peach and orange in Florida, and the French had planted\r\nthe grape and pear in their sparse settlements in the Mississippi\r\nValley and near the Great Lakes. There are to-day, and yet in a healthy\r\ncondition, near Detroit, Michigan, several immense pear-trees from\r\nthese first plantings, that are nearly three hundred years old. The\r\nCatholic fathers planted the vine and the olive, and occasionally the\r\ndate palm, at their mission stations along the Rio Grande and on the\r\nPacific coast.\r\n\r\nThus we see that when the year 1800 ushered in the century now closing,\r\nthere were many feeble beginnings in the way of fruit culture scattered\r\nover the Continent. The Indians, contrary to what we might have\r\nsupposed, helped materially in the distribution of some of the orchard\r\nfruits. In 1799, when General Sullivan made his famous raid against\r\nthe tribes which composed the historic “Six nations,” he found bearing\r\napple orchards in Western New York. In Southern Canada and Michigan\r\nthe Indians occasionally planted the apple and pear. The tribes living\r\nalong the Gulf of Mexico had peach-trees in their little cultivated\r\npatches, having obtained the seeds from the Spaniards; and to-day we\r\nfind the descendants of these Spanish or “Indian” peaches commonly\r\ngrown throughout all the Southern States, and to some extent all over\r\nthe peach-growing sections of America.\r\n\r\nTHE EXPERIMENTAL STAGE.—During the life of the generation which\r\nexisted for the first thirty or more years of the century the culture\r\nof fruits was still principally in the experimental stage. Some of the\r\nforeign species and varieties had not proved satisfactory, and they\r\nwere being critically tested or abandoned. New varieties were being\r\noriginated on our own soil. Our native fruits were being brought under\r\nculture, too, and with the most satisfactory results in many cases.\r\nIt was learned that we had in them the foundation of almost unlimited\r\ndevelopment. Their progeny has revolutionized some lines of fruit\r\nculture. This is especially true in our vineyards and berry-fields.\r\n\r\nThere were men of noble and patriotic cast of mind, who devoted their\r\nlives to the development of this lovely and wholly humane work. They\r\ndeserve to rank beside the heroes of our battlefields. Their victories\r\nwere those of peace, and were followed by an increase of the delightful\r\nproducts of the orchard, vineyard, and garden.\r\n\r\nOnce that our forefathers were free from the bondage of European greed,\r\nthis art of peace kept pace with our civilization on other lines.\r\nThere is nothing in the whole list of our scientific attainments or\r\nmaterial industries that can show more substantial progress. Nor is\r\nthere a nation on earth that has so rich, varied, and adaptable soils,\r\ntogether with climatic conditions so admirably and generally suited to\r\nfruit culture; nor a people more alive to their opportunities in this\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nTHE AGE OF PROGRESS.—During the generation of fruit growers who lived\r\nfrom about 1830 until the time of the Civil War, the region lying\r\nbetween the Alleghany Mountains and the Missouri River, and extending\r\nfrom the Ottawa River in Canada to the mountains of Tennessee, which\r\nis now the great apple bin of America, as well as its granary, was\r\nbeing rapidly filled with energetic settlers. These pioneers carried\r\nwith them carefully selected seeds, cuttings, and trees of the best\r\nvarieties of fruits known in their Eastern and Southern homes. These\r\nwere planted in the rich, virgin soil of the new territory, which was\r\nthen known as “The West.” Under the happy influences of a congenial\r\nclimate and careful cultivation, they developed into fruitful orchards\r\nand vineyards, yielding finer specimens, and, in some cases, larger\r\ncrops than had ever been known in the older parts of the country.\r\nThis gave a great impetus to the culture of fruits. The first large\r\ncommercial orchards of the apple, peach, and pear in the central United\r\nStates were then being planted in Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, and Kentucky.\r\n\r\nThe South had not yet awakened to a knowledge of her possibilities in\r\nfruit culture. Under slave labor the land was almost solely given up to\r\ncotton and tobacco. Florida had not then even dreamed of her wonderful\r\ndevelopments in orange culture. In Missouri, Kansas, Arkansas, Texas,\r\nand the great Northwest, where now there are fruit plantations of\r\nalmost unparalleled extent, only the first trees and plants were being\r\nset, and it was only thought _possible that some day_ fruits could be\r\nproduced in abundance there. The Rocky Mountain and Pacific States had\r\nscarcely been heard of, even as Territories, and only an occasional\r\nplantation of vines and trees around some mission station could be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COCOANUT TREE, PALM BEACH, FLA.]\r\n\r\nTHE AGE OF TRIUMPH.—At the close of the Civil War, which had somewhat\r\ndistracted the attention of our people both North and South from the\r\nprogress of the peaceful arts, there was a great expansion of our\r\nrural population. The love of travel had taken possession of many who\r\nhad been in the armies. They were no longer content with the narrow\r\nboundaries and the poor lands of the old Eastern farms. They wanted new\r\nfields for their energies. The building of the great railroad systems\r\nacross the continent solved the question of the settlement of the “Far\r\nWest,” and the mythical “American Desert” that was supposed to lie this\r\nside of it. The prairies were covered with homesteaders’ shanties, sod\r\nhouses, and “dug-outs.” The forests of Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota,\r\nMissouri, and Arkansas fell before the axe of the pioneer. The “Boys\r\nin Blue” who had seen the natural advantages of the Southern States,\r\nwhile there on the dread errand of war, began the rehabilitation of the\r\ncountry they had helped to devastate. They took with them their Yankee\r\nnotions and Western vim, and planted many kinds of farm crops, trees,\r\nvines, and berry bushes upon the old plantations where little else than\r\ncotton and tobacco used to grow. Florida was veritably turned into a\r\ngarden of orange trees and truck patches. The chocolate hills and rich\r\nblack lands of Texas were planted to grapes, peaches, and berries. The\r\ndry plains and mesas of the Rocky Mountain region, that were naturally\r\nalmost devoid of vegetation, were irrigated and made to produce the\r\nmost delightful fruits in abundance. The giant forests of Oregon and\r\nWashington were invaded by the lumberman and the homeseeker, and in\r\ntheir stead were planted trees which yielded the largest and best of\r\nfruits. And California,—what shall we say of her wonderful valleys,\r\ngrassy foothills, and timbered mountain slopes? All of the fruits of\r\nthe temperate zones are growing there, and in some places the hardier\r\nof the tropical kinds succeed. California is indeed a land of fruits.\r\n\r\nTaking the whole of North America, except the frozen regions of the\r\nBritish possessions, and Alaska, where few cultivated fruits can be\r\ngrown; and half-civilized Mexico, where progress is scarcely known;\r\nthe last thirty-five years have witnessed such advancements in fruit\r\nculture as seem almost beyond belief. It has truly been an age of\r\ntriumph. Not only has the territory of its successful culture been\r\nwonderfully extended, but the whole plan and science of fruit-growing\r\nhas been almost revolutionized. Old things have largely passed away.\r\nNew varieties, new methods of culture and new markets for the products\r\nof the fruit farm have been found. Some of the old varieties have been\r\nretained, but many new ones have been originated here; some by chance\r\nand others by scientific breeding. Valuable kinds that had long been\r\nlying in obscurity have been brought into public favor. Others have\r\nbeen imported from foreign countries. Almost the entire world has been\r\nransacked in order to obtain fruits that might prove of value to us.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of this period of unparalleled progress the\r\nexperiments of former years had shown the success or failure of the\r\ndifferent species and varieties already in cultivation in many parts\r\nof the country; and now, at its close, after nearly forty years more\r\nof experience, there is scarcely a section within the entire domain of\r\nNorth American fruit culture where it is not quite well known what is\r\nand what is not adapted to each locality.\r\n\r\nThe methods of culture are changed from the old ones, which were\r\nlargely those practiced in Europe, to such as have been evolved by\r\nthe peculiar necessities of our soil, climate, and varieties. This is\r\nespecially true of our vineyards; for, except on the Pacific slope,\r\nwhere the foreign grapes succeed, our native vines require much less\r\nsevere pruning, and a much more roomy trellis upon which to grow than\r\nthose old kinds. The first vineyards were planted very thickly and\r\ntrained by the stake method, which is the French and German style. I\r\nremember working in such vineyards just prior to 1870, and of seeing\r\nthe dwarfing and dwindling effect upon the vines. Nothing of the kind\r\nis now seen this side the Rocky Mountains, because our American grapes\r\nwill not endure such treatment and continue to bear well.\r\n\r\nHorse culture has in a great measure succeeded hand culture. Without\r\nsuch a change it would be impossible to profitably cultivate the vast\r\nstretches of orchards, vineyards, and berry-fields that are to-day\r\nfound in many parts of the country. The common plow and harrow were\r\nabout the only tools available thirty or forty years ago. They are\r\nnow supplemented, and in some cases superseded, by various kinds of\r\ncultivators, weeders, and improved plows and harrows. They are made to\r\ncarry out the modern idea of frequent but shallow stirring of the soil.\r\nThis method of culture disturbs the roots but little and retains the\r\nmoisture in the soil, by keeping the surface finely pulverized, thus\r\nforming a “dust mulch.” Some of these tools are so made as to enable\r\none man with one horse to easily cultivate twenty-five acres per day,\r\nand with a two or three horse implement, to thoroughly pulverize the\r\nsurface over fifty or more acres in that time.\r\n\r\nThe tendency during the last half century has been towards heading\r\norchard trees lower. The old style was to have them with trunks so\r\ntall that a horse could walk under the branches. Low heads have the\r\nadvantage of giving the winds less purchase upon the roots, the fruit\r\nis more easily gathered, and the sun is less likely to scald the trunks.\r\n\r\nThe old idea of our forefathers was, that apples were chiefly to be\r\nused for making cider, peaches for brandy, and grapes for wine. We have\r\nbecome a nation of fruit-eaters, as compared with our predecessors\r\nand the Europeans. The greatest impetus ever given to American fruit\r\nculture came from the increased demand in our own country for fresh\r\nfruit. It is a staple article of diet here, rather than a luxury, as\r\nit is in most parts of Europe. Nearly all of our fresh fruits are\r\nconsumed in the homes of our people, or exported. A very little is\r\nmade into cider, brandy, or wine, and the larger part of the remainder\r\nis dried or canned. The proportion of grapes made into wine east of\r\nCalifornia is trifling, while there it is considerable. The enormous\r\nproduction and consumption of berries of various kinds by the Americans\r\nis unparalleled in the history of the world; and nearly all of this has\r\ncome through the development of our wild berries.\r\n\r\nInstead of buying largely of foreign fruits and their products, except\r\nsuch as are strictly tropical and cannot be grown within our borders\r\nonly in a limited way, we have nearly stopped their importation, and\r\nhave, in turn, become exporters. The rapid increase in our population\r\ndemands more and more fruit, and it is not to be wondered at that our\r\nimports of oranges and lemons is increasing; but if it was not for\r\nour home production of these fruits the present amount would be more\r\nthan doubled. Our raisins and dried prunes have almost driven out\r\nthe foreign products, and their quality is so good that there is a\r\ngrowing demand for them in England and some other foreign countries.\r\nThe same is true of our canned and preserved fruits. Our apples bring\r\nthe highest price of any that reach the markets of Europe, and the\r\ndemand for them is increasing. Fresh pears and peaches have also been\r\nsent to England in limited quantities from as far west as California\r\nand Oregon. Our oranges also have an enviable reputation there because\r\nof their beauty and delicious flavor. Our apples are sent to Mexico,\r\nChina, and Japan. The street venders of Bombay, India, cry their sale\r\nwith great gusto: “American apples! true American apples!” and sell\r\nthem at a price which would require more than a whole day’s wages of a\r\ngood workman to buy a single one.\r\n\r\nThe world is beginning to know the value and goodness of our fruits.\r\nWe are selling, inside their dainty skins, a portion of our sunshine\r\nand water; for the golden, pink, and crimson tints are from the glowing\r\nsun, and the water, which is the main part of all fruits, is fresh from\r\nnature’s fountain.\r\n\r\nGROWTH OF APPLE CULTURE.—From the first settlement of the country well\r\ninto the present century, the principal purpose for which apples were\r\ncultivated in America was to make cider. This was a common beverage in\r\nEngland and on the continent of Europe, whence our forefathers came.\r\nHere they introduced the Old World custom of drinking hard cider “in\r\nseason and out of season.” In 1721, in one “town” near Boston, wherein\r\nlived about forty families, there were made in one year three thousand\r\nbarrels of cider, and in another of two hundred families, near ten\r\nthousand barrels. This is fifty barrels to the family, which seems\r\nample for a great many drinks per day for each person, with plenty left\r\nto sell to the cider-loving citizens of Boston. Colonel John Taylor of\r\nVirginia wrote, in 1813, nearly one hundred years later: “The apple\r\nwill furnish some food for hogs, a luxury for the family in winter, and\r\na healthy liquor for the farmer and his laborers all the year.”\r\n\r\nBut hard cider did not always satisfy. “Applejack,” which is the\r\nstrongest kind of brandy, suited the taste of many of the old-fashioned\r\nfolk much better. The Virginia gentleman, the Dutch burgher, whose\r\nample acres fronted upon the Hudson, the solemn Philadelphia Quaker\r\nand the staid Puritan of New England, all loved their dram and took it\r\nfrequently.\r\n\r\nBesides alcoholic liquors, vinegar was made in considerable quantities.\r\nBut as late as the middle of this century there was scarcely a good\r\nfamily apple orchard to be found, such as we now have, with varieties\r\narranged to ripen from early to late. Nor were there many commercial\r\norchards of consequence. The famous orchard of Robert L. Pell, in\r\nUlster County, New York, was a remarkable exception. It consisted of\r\n20,000 trees, all of the Yellow and Green Newtown apples. Fruit from\r\nthis orchard sold at wholesale in London, England, in 1845, at the\r\nenormous price of $21.00 per barrel, but the next year the price had\r\nfallen to $6.00 in New York city, ready for foreign shipment. This\r\norchard gradually fell into decay, and was not soon followed by others\r\nof so large acreage. The Newtown apple proved unsuitable for general\r\nculture, and is now grown only in two localities with much success.\r\nIn the mountain “coves,” or sheltered slopes and valleys, of the Blue\r\nRidge, in Virginia and North Carolina, where it is called “Albemarle\r\nPippin,” there are many orchards that produce as fine fruit as any from\r\nthe Pell orchard, and it now sells from $5.00 to $12.00 and more per\r\nbarrel in England. In the higher foothills of California and Oregon\r\nthis variety does equally well, and apples from there are being sold in\r\nEngland during this closing period of the century at almost fabulous\r\nprices.\r\n\r\nIn the old days, if an orchard furnished an abundance of apples for\r\ncider, brandy, vinegar, apple butter, some for drying, and a few of\r\nfair quality that would keep for winter use, it was all that was\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PACKING APPLES FOR EXPORT, IN ORCHARD OF MR. PAY, ST.\r\nCATHARINES, ONT.]\r\n\r\nMost of the trees in those old orchards were inferior seedlings, and it\r\nis no wonder that the people of those days did not use apples as we do.\r\nA few of them were very good, and it is from such chance favorites that\r\nwe have preserved to us, by grafting, the Baldwin Winesap and hundreds\r\nmore that fill our orchards to-day. We have developed a new race of\r\nAmerican seedlings. Most of the old varieties that were so highly\r\nesteemed across the ocean are now rarely mentioned. Our newer and\r\nbetter kinds have largely supplanted them. As time advanced more choice\r\nvarieties were added, until we may now confidently boast of having\r\nthe best apples in existence. Whoever has eaten our delicious Grimes\r\nGolden, Jonathan, and Northern Spy, need not look for better kinds,\r\nbecause they cannot now be found. Indeed, the name “Seek-no-farther”\r\nhas been triumphantly applied to one variety. However, we are still\r\nseeking and expecting to produce by skillful breeding, if not to find,\r\nothers which may be even better than those we now possess.\r\n\r\nA history of the recognized and named varieties of apples of American\r\norigin would be a book in itself. It should begin almost with the first\r\nsettlement of the country. At the beginning of this century the Early\r\nHarvest, Baldwin, Swaar, Esopus Spitzenberg, Rhode Island Greening,\r\nYellow Bellflower, and a few others which are yet popular, were already\r\ngrafted into hundreds of orchards, some of them being as far west as\r\nthe Mississippi River. William Coxe, in his excellent book on fruits,\r\npublished in 1817, mentions 100 kinds. William Prince, of Long Island,\r\nwho kept the first nursery of note, had 116 varieties of apples in his\r\npublished list in 1825, of which about half were of American origin.\r\nNow there are nearly 1000 kinds offered by the nurserymen of the\r\ncountry, and the books on pomology contain nearly 5000 varieties, a\r\nlarge part of them being American. Truly this is progress.\r\n\r\nWe have the best and by far the most extensive apple country in the\r\nworld. The largest apple orchards in the world are in America. The\r\nbiggest of all belongs to F. Wellhouse & Son, of Kansas, in which there\r\nare 1600 acres. There are others in Missouri, Illinois, Iowa, Colorado,\r\nand New Mexico that are nearly as large.\r\n\r\nThe variety principally grown in these orchards is the Ben Davis. It\r\nis a thrifty, rugged grower, a most productive bearer, and a handsome\r\napple to sell. Its brilliant red stripes, large size, and ability to\r\nkeep, make up for its deficiency in flavor. It is, to-day, the business\r\napple of America. Baldwin is the business apple of the Eastern States.\r\nBoth these varieties are well known in every market of this country,\r\nand wherever our apples are exported.\r\n\r\nThe first government record of exported apples was in 1821, when\r\n“68,643 bushels,” or about 22,781 barrels of apples, were sent abroad.\r\nIn 1897 there were 2,371,143 barrels exported, which is the largest\r\nquantity ever shipped to foreign countries in one year. During the same\r\nyear there were also exported nearly 31,000,000 pounds of dried apples,\r\n94,000 gallons of vinegar, and 750,000 gallons of cider. Certainly this\r\nis a good showing for the surplus products of American apple orchards.\r\nThe year 1898 gave a lighter yield, but 1899 will, perhaps, about equal\r\nit.\r\n\r\nTHE PEAR.—Whoever has eaten a delicious little Seckel pear must know\r\nthat its equal in richness and spicy flavor is not to be found. This\r\nlittle gem is one of the triumphs of American fruit culture. How far\r\nbeyond and above the old “choke” pear of our grandfathers’ days\r\nis this one, and many more of the delicious pears that grow in our\r\norchards and gardens to-day!\r\n\r\nPear growing was only a side issue until lately. A few trees were\r\nplanted about our forefathers’ houses or in the edge of the apple\r\norchards; but these were often sprouts from some neighbor’s seedling\r\ntrees. As the appetite for good fruit increased, the false idea that\r\npears should be ground and pressed into cider, called perry, decreased,\r\nuntil now no one thinks of wasting this delicious fruit by making it\r\ninto an intoxicating drink.\r\n\r\nThe Bartlett is our most popular pear of good quality. It originated\r\nin Berkshire, England, about 1770, where it was called Williams. When\r\nbrought to America early in this century and planted at Dorchester,\r\nMass., the original name was lost, and it was renamed in honor of Enoch\r\nBartlett, who first propagated and distributed the trees and grafts.\r\nThe old tree, from which came the millions that have been and are now\r\na source of delight and profit to our people, is still in bearing\r\ncondition at Dorchester, and I have lately eaten as good Bartlett pears\r\nfrom it as ever were grown. The variety flourishes better in America\r\nthan in its old home, and every year large shipments of the fruit are\r\nsent to England and sold at a very high price.\r\n\r\nSome fifty years ago there were brought from China seeds of a type of\r\na pear that was entirely new to this country, and was called by us the\r\n“Sand” pear. The only apparent reason for giving it this name is, that\r\nit is gritty, hard, and little better to eat than so much sand. But the\r\nseeds made trees that grew with remarkable vigor and were much alike,\r\nand so was their fruit.\r\n\r\nFrom this stock came up a seedling some thirty years ago, in the garden\r\nof Peter Kieffer, in Philadelphia, that has almost revolutionized\r\npear growing in America. It is supposed to be the result of a cross\r\nbetween a Chinese Sand pear-tree and a Bartlett that stood near each\r\nother, although this is mere supposition. The fruit is only of medium\r\nquality, and some say it is very poor; but it is large, very beautiful\r\nwhen fully mature, late in ripening, and endures rough handling with as\r\nlittle harm as so many potatoes. It is very popular with the canners.\r\nThe greatest point in its favor is the freedom of the tree from blight,\r\nits vigor and almost never-failing and abundant bearing. It is the\r\nbusiness pear of to-day, despite its inferior quality.\r\n\r\nTHE PEACH.—When the peach was first planted in America by the Spanish\r\nand French, and later by other nationalities, there was little thought\r\nof it ever becoming a great commercial fruit. The trees that sprang\r\nfrom the seeds brought across the ocean grew so luxuriantly and bore so\r\nabundantly that their progeny was soon scattered far and wide. Peach\r\ntrees were early found growing wild, like our native trees, wherever\r\nseeds had been dropped by travelers or hunters. There was no attempt at\r\ncommercial peach orcharding until well into the present century, and\r\nfor the first half of this there were scarcely more than a few seedling\r\norchards planted for family use or for making brandy. In some sections\r\ndried peaches were an article of trade before any commercial peach\r\norchards, in the true sense, had been planted; but they were always the\r\nproduct of women’s work, and were prepared under the disadvantageous\r\nconditions with which they are usually hampered. It is no wonder that\r\nthe grade was low, for the peaches were generally of poor quality,\r\nand no other mode of drying was then known than on boards and wooden\r\ntrays, exposed in the open air to flies, moths, and dust. All that\r\nwas sent to market was first taken in at the stores where the country\r\npeople came to trade, and it was a mixed mess, indeed, that was thus\r\ncollected. What fresh peaches were sold brought a very low price,\r\nrarely more than twenty-five cents per bushel.\r\n\r\nEarly in the century budded peach-trees were almost unknown in America.\r\nA few were brought over from France and the fruit houses of England,\r\nall of which did very well here. However, it was soon learned that\r\nthere were seedlings of American origin that were equal to the best of\r\nthe foreign kinds. Among the first of these were Heath, Early York,\r\nTillotson, and Oldmixon Cling and Free. A little later, two large\r\nyellow freestones came up by accident on the premises of William\r\nCrawford, of Middletown, N. J., one ripening early and the other late.\r\nEarly Crawford and Late Crawford are, after more than sixty years of\r\ntrial, still very popular upon the markets. Many other kinds, once\r\npopular, have long since been discarded and forgotten.\r\n\r\nJust before our Civil War the Hale peach was discovered and, being\r\nearlier than any kind then known, it became very popular. About 1865,\r\nthe Amsden, Alexander, and some others came to notice. They were a\r\nmonth earlier than the Hale. A peach, called Peen-to, was imported from\r\nsouthern China about the same time, that ripened still a month earlier;\r\nbut as it belonged to a very different race from our other peaches, and\r\nwas exceedingly tender, it has been found suitable only to Florida and\r\nother semitropical regions.\r\n\r\nThe most popular peach of the present day is the Elberta. It was\r\noriginated by Samuel H. Rumph, of Georgia, about twenty years ago.\r\nIts large size, creamy, yellow color, and good flavor, added to its\r\nproductiveness, make it very acceptable to both grower and consumer.\r\n\r\nThe most extensive peach orchards in America are located in Georgia,\r\nNorth Carolina, Southern Missouri, Western Colorado, and California. A\r\nfew are each more than a thousand acres in extent.\r\n\r\nThe advent of patent evaporating machines, about 1870, aided greatly in\r\nthe production of high grade dried fruits of all kinds, and the peach\r\nshared in the progress. California and Oregon alone shipped in a single\r\nrecent year nearly 40,000,000 pounds of dried peaches. The peach is\r\ncanned more than any other fruit, as may be seen upon the shelves of\r\nany grocery store, or in the fruit closets of the country housewives.\r\nWhether eaten fresh from the trees, served up with cream and sugar (a\r\ndainty dish unknown in Europe), evaporated or canned, the peach is one\r\nof the blessings of our great country.\r\n\r\nTHE PLUM.—There are three general classes of plums grown in America\r\nto-day, the European, American, and Japanese. European plums were\r\nintroduced here at an early day, but were grown very sparingly until\r\nwithin the last thirty or forty years. The principal reason for this\r\nis the presence of a deadly enemy to the plum, apricot, and some other\r\nfruits, commonly known as the plum curculio. It is a _little_ enemy but\r\na _mighty_ one; for it deposits its eggs in the young fruit, and they\r\nsoon hatch into little grubs that work their way into the fruit and\r\ncause it to die and drop off. West of the Continental divide there are\r\nnone of these insects. There the soil, climate, and all else seem to\r\nconspire to enable the plum-grower to prosper. Great prune orchards are\r\nplanted in the fertile valleys from New Mexico and Colorado westward.\r\nSome of them cover thousands of acres in a body, and the yield is\r\nenormous. The rainless autumns of California permit the drying of the\r\nfruit in the open air and in the most economical and perfect way. From\r\nan infant industry twenty years ago it has now grown so great that,\r\nin 1897, California alone produced nearly 98,000,000 pounds of dried\r\nprunes. Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and some other western States are\r\nalmost equally well suited to this industry.\r\n\r\nEast of the Rocky Mountains plum-growing is not so easy. The curculio\r\ndamages all classes of plums to some extent, but the European kinds\r\nseem to be much less able to endure its attacks than any other. This\r\nled to the selection and cultivation of the best varieties of our\r\nseveral native species. Their fruit is not so large or so richly\r\nflavored as some of the foreign kinds, but much of it is very good, and\r\nthe brilliant red, purple, and yellow colors are greatly admired. The\r\nJapanese plums are of quite recent introduction. The beginning was in\r\n1870, when the Kelsey, which is the largest, the latest to ripen, and\r\nabout one of the least valuable varieties of this class was brought\r\nto California. Later importations have brought us many very valuable\r\nkinds. The trees bear well, the fruit is mostly large, handsome, of\r\ngood quality, and resists the stings of the curculio quite as well as\r\nour native kinds.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting and promising steps in plum-growing is only\r\nbeginning to be made, in the crossing of the three classes named. The\r\nmost skillful and patient worker in this field is Luther Burbank, of\r\nCalifornia, who has already produced, by artificially pollenizing the\r\nflowers, some most excellent varieties. Some of these new varieties\r\nare larger than any plums ever before seen, delicious in flavor, and\r\nblood-red to the stone.\r\n\r\nTHE CHERRY.—Away back in the history of our country, cherry trees were\r\nplanted here and there, but only for family use. The list of varieties\r\nwas meagre. Most of them were sour, bitter, or small. Now we have\r\nhundreds of named varieties and of all grades of color, from creamy\r\nyellow to black, and both sweet and sour, early and late.\r\n\r\nIn Washington, Oregon, and California the cherry does better than in\r\nany of the regions farther East. The first cherries of the season\r\nto ripen are in the famous Vaca Valley of California, and sometimes\r\nshipments from there reach New York as early as April 1. The largest\r\ncherry trees in America are found in the foot-hill regions of\r\nPennsylvania and Virginia. Trees are sometimes seen there that have\r\ntrunks three feet in diameter, with a spread of branches of more than\r\nfifty feet. Such trees sometimes yield more than fifty bushels of fruit\r\nat a time.\r\n\r\nTHE APRICOT.—All over the Eastern and Central States the apricot is\r\nalmost an entire failure because of the ravages of the plum curculio.\r\nAfter many years of trial its culture there has been almost abandoned,\r\nexcept by those who are willing to follow the jarring of the trees to\r\ncatch the insects. Across the Continental divide, where this enemy does\r\nnot exist, the apricot flourishes as well or better than anywhere else\r\nin the world. It is one of the profitable fruits from western Colorado\r\nto the shores of the Pacific. California dried and sent to market\r\nin one year over 30,000,000 pounds. There is also a great amount of\r\napricots canned there every year, a large part of which are shipped all\r\nover the world.\r\n\r\nTHE QUINCE.—Although sour and unfit for eating from the hand, the\r\nquince is one of our most delicious fruits when cooked. No store of\r\nsweetmeats is complete without a generous supply of quince jelly. This\r\nfruit delights in a moist soil and a cool but not severe climate.\r\nHowever, it succeeds very well over the main part of North America.\r\nAlmost every home plot has a tree or two. In western New York\r\nmany commercial quince orchards have been planted within the last\r\ntwenty-five years, some of them being of forty acres in extent.\r\n\r\nAMERICAN GRAPE CULTURE.—In no department of American pomology has\r\nthere been more remarkable advancement than in grape-growing. It was\r\nthe belief of those who first began to grow fruits here, that the\r\ngrapes of Canaan, Persia, Greece, and Rome, which were brought down\r\nthrough the ages to the vineyards of modern Europe, would grow equally\r\nwell in America. One great reason for this belief was the abundance of\r\nwild grapes of many kinds that were found from Nova Scotia to Texas.\r\n\r\nOne of the first things the pioneers of civilization did in New\r\nEngland, at Roanoke Island, and at Jamestown, was to make wine of\r\nthe native grapes. The Spaniards in 1564 also made wine of the wild\r\ngrapes of Florida. After testing the wine and finding it inferior to\r\nthat produced in their old homes, they were more determined to grow\r\nvineyards of the choicest grapes of Europe. The French established a\r\nvineyard of this kind in Virginia, and another in southern Illinois;\r\nand William Penn did the same near Philadelphia in 1683. The most\r\nnotable attempt that was made was by John James Dufour, a native of\r\nSwitzerland. He came to America in 1796, and at once set about doing\r\nthe wisest thing that he could have done, by first visiting and\r\ncritically examining the vineyards that had already been started. He\r\nwas not favorably impressed by what he saw, for the European vines\r\nhad done very poorly, because of some unknown disease or weakness\r\nthat seemed to cause them to make but feeble growth, or gradually\r\ndwindle and die. The cause has since been found to have been the fungus\r\ndiseases and insect pests that are peculiar to the eastern half of\r\nAmerica. But Dufour thought the right varieties had not been tried,\r\nexcept a few that he found near Philadelphia. From these he secured a\r\nstart, and in 1799 organized a stock company with $10,000 in capital,\r\nto plant a vineyard, Henry Clay being one of the stockholders. A tract\r\nof 633 acres was selected near Lexington, Ky., and there he began work\r\nin the most enthusiastic manner. He induced two of his brothers to come\r\nfrom Switzerland to join him, and they brought other varieties of their\r\nbest grapes. But after three years’ trial he gave it up as a hopeless\r\neffort and turned his attention to the cultivation of our native grapes.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of successful grape culture in America may be said to\r\nhave been made by Dufour, in his next or second attempt, which was in\r\n1802, at Vevay, Ind., on the banks of the Ohio, and with a variety of\r\nthe wild _Vitis labrusca_, or fox grape, found near the Schuylkill\r\nRiver before the Revolutionary War. It was at first called the “Cape”\r\ngrape, from a mistaken notion that it had been brought from the Cape\r\nof Good Hope. It was also known by several other names. Although this\r\ngrape was the first of a very long list of native varieties which\r\nhave made our country famous in grape culture, it has long since been\r\nentirely abandoned for better kinds. But the vineyard at Vevay,\r\nplanted largely of this variety, was the first really successful one in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SINGLE VINE OF “LADY DE COVERLY” GRAPE (SEEDLESS) GROWN\r\nBY J. P. ONSTOTT, MARYVILLE, CAL.]\r\n\r\nThe next forward step was the introduction of the Isabella and Catawba,\r\nboth having originated in America, not long previous to 1820, although\r\nof unknown parentage; but, perhaps, as the results of accidental\r\ncrossing between our native wild grapes and some of the foreign kinds.\r\nThe Isabella is supposed to have originated in South Carolina, and was\r\nbrought from there by Mrs. Isabella Gibbs and planted in her garden\r\nin Brooklyn, N. Y., where it came to the notice of William R. Prince\r\nin 1816, when in full bearing. He named it Isabella in her honor, and\r\nintroduced it to the general public.\r\n\r\nThe Catawba is supposed to have originated as a seedling near the\r\nCatawba River, in North Carolina, but was not generally known until\r\nMajor John Adlum, of the District of Columbia, found it in bearing on\r\nthe premises of Mrs. Scholl, a tavern keeper of Clarksburgh, Md. He\r\nwas at once delighted with its good qualities, and planted it in his\r\nexperiment grounds at Georgetown in 1819, and introduced it to the\r\nfruit-loving public soon after.\r\n\r\nThe next impetus to grape culture was caused by the introduction of\r\nthe Delaware and Concord. The exact origin of the Delaware is not\r\nknown, but it came to public notice about 1855, through the efforts of\r\nMr. A. Thomson and George W. Campbell, of Delaware, O. It was learned\r\nafterwards that the same variety was growing in 1850, in the garden of\r\na Swiss immigrant, Paul H. Provost, at Frenchtown, N. J. It may be that\r\nit originated at this place from a chance seed, and that cuttings were\r\nthence carried to Ohio. It is evidently a cross between the foreign\r\nspecies and one of our natives, and is to-day about the best of all the\r\ngrapes grown in the Eastern States.\r\n\r\nThe Concord is a pure native seedling, produced by Ephraim W. Bull, of\r\nConcord, Mass., and first shown to the public at Boston in 1853. It\r\nhas proved itself to be the greatest blessing of all grapes that have\r\never been grown in America. Its thriftiness and reliability under all\r\ncircumstances are unequaled. It is not only good in itself, but it has\r\nbeen the parent of a race of seedlings which have filled our vineyards,\r\ngardens, and markets with the most delicious grapes, and at a very\r\nslight cost of labor or money. Whoever gathers or buys a basket of\r\nblue-black Concord or Worden, purple Brighton or opal Niagara, should\r\nrender a silent thank-offering to the memory of Ephraim W. Bull, who\r\nmade their existence a possibility.\r\n\r\nThe first commercial vineyard of importance was planted by Nicholas\r\nLongworth, on the hills overlooking the Ohio River, about ten miles\r\nbelow Cincinnati, and it was largely of Catawba. Many others followed\r\nhis example, and from about 1830 to 1860 so great an interest was\r\nshown that the hills bordering the Ohio for many miles were dotted\r\nwith vineyards. But mildew and black rot devastated them and almost\r\ndestroyed their usefulness. These diseases are now largely overcome by\r\nspraying with a solution of sulphate of copper.\r\n\r\nIn northern Ohio, about Cleveland and Sandusky, and on the islands near\r\nthe southern shore of Lake Erie, the Catawba was planted with much\r\nbetter success, owing, perhaps, to the climate not being so favorable\r\nto grape diseases. The lake region of western New York is perhaps\r\nmore densely planted with grapes than any section east of California.\r\nThousands of carloads of grapes of high quality are shipped from\r\nthere every year. The Southern States have awakened somewhat to the\r\nimportance of grape culture. Some of the poorest sandy lands of North\r\nCarolina and Florida have been planted to vines and found to produce,\r\nwhen fertilized, excellent grapes. Texas is also a most productive\r\ngrape region. Their earliness causes them to find a ready market in the\r\nNorth.\r\n\r\nBut in all of North America there is no section where the grape\r\nflourishes with such wonderful success as in California and other\r\nregions beyond the Rocky Mountains. There the tenderest and most\r\ndelicious of all the grapes of France, Italy, Persia, and Palestine\r\nripen their luscious clusters beneath the glowing skies. The grapes\r\nof Eshcol, I imagine, did not surpass those now grown in California,\r\nArizona, New Mexico, and Idaho. All up and down their fertile valleys\r\nand foot-hills may be seen great stretches of vineyard after vineyard.\r\nThe raisin industry alone is immense; and the product is of such high\r\nquality and is produced at so low cost that the importation of European\r\nraisins is becoming less each year, and may soon be practically at an\r\nend. We have already begun exporting our raisins to England and other\r\nparts of the world. Over 103,000,000 pounds, filling 5000 cars, were\r\nshipped from California alone in one year. Single clusters of grapes\r\nhave frequently been grown in California that weighed from ten to\r\nfifteen pounds, and four or five pound clusters are very common. Truly,\r\nAmerica is a land of grapes.\r\n\r\nTHE BERRIES.—America stands alone in the popular use of berries.\r\nExcept in the matter of gooseberries and currants, which are rather\r\nplentiful in some parts of Europe, and a few strawberries and\r\nraspberries there and in Japan, there are very few berries grown\r\noutside of America.\r\n\r\nThe strawberry was found wild here in all sections. The fruit was\r\nsmall but of most delicious flavor. A few of the varieties grown in\r\nthe mother country were brought over here, but they did not flourish.\r\nAbout 1834 C. M. Hovey, of Cambridge, Mass., grew some seedlings of\r\nthe old Pine strawberry, which is an offshoot of the wild strawberry\r\nof the west coast of South America, and his introduction of varieties\r\nnamed Hovey and Boston Pine marked the first step in our modern\r\nstrawberry culture. Next came the Wilson, which originated about 1850\r\non the grounds of John Wilson, of Albany, N. Y. This variety really\r\npopularized the growing of strawberries, because of its hardiness and\r\nproductiveness. Soon after this the Crescent was found at New Orleans,\r\nLa. Other kinds were soon originated from seed by experimenters, and\r\nchance seedlings were found coming up in all fruit-growing regions.\r\nIt was not long until there were hundreds of named varieties of good\r\nquality and that bore abundantly. Within the last decade or two there\r\nhave been hundreds more originated by the most skillful hybridizers\r\nusing our native species and the foreign ones also. Others just as\r\ngood were picked up wherever they chanced to grow from seed. Thus, we\r\nnow have the most wonderful assortment of varieties of the strawberry\r\nin the world. They are early, medium, and late. The facilities\r\nfor shipping are so convenient that, now, it is possible to have\r\nstrawberries in the fancy markets almost every day of the year, from\r\nsome section of our great country. In the flush of the season they are\r\nso cheap and abundant that the poor can enjoy them along with the rich.\r\nFrom little garden patches fifty years ago, and very small ones too, we\r\nhave now come to grow them by the thousand acres.\r\n\r\nThe raspberry is another of our delicious berries. At first our\r\npioneers were satisfied with those they could gather from the wild\r\nbushes. Following the same plan that was used with most other fruits,\r\nthe European raspberries were brought over the sea and planted in the\r\ngardens of America. But they did poorly, and about 1850 our people\r\nbegan to plant the native varieties. These grew and bore well. Now we\r\nhave hundreds of the very choicest named kinds, black, red, purple, and\r\nyellow, early and late, and more being originated every year.\r\n\r\nThe history of the gooseberry is almost identical with that of the\r\nraspberry. The foreign kinds, although bearing very much larger fruit\r\nthan our native kinds, were ruined by mildew. About 1845 Abel Houghton,\r\nof Massachusetts, grew a seedling from the wild berry, which was named\r\nHoughton, and from this came another seedling, the Downing, which was\r\noriginated at Newburgh, N. Y., some years later. These two varieties\r\nare now among our very best kinds. Since the benefits of spraying with\r\nfungicides have been known, the larger and milder flavored English\r\nkinds are being grown with considerable success.\r\n\r\nThe blackberry is found native only in America. It has been one of the\r\nmost useful of all our wild fruits from the earliest settlement of the\r\ncountry, and was used by the aborigines for centuries before. Until\r\nabout 1840 there was not enough thought given to blackberry culture\r\nto make the least attempt in that direction, when Captain Lovett, of\r\nBeverly, Mass., gave the name Dorchester to a chance variety, and\r\ndistributed it. Soon after 1850 the Lawton was taken from its wild\r\nhabitat on the banks of the Hudson River. This variety was the first\r\nreally good blackberry that was named and distributed. The Kitatinny\r\nfollowed about ten years later, having been found wild in the mountains\r\nof western New Jersey. At least two white varieties, and several having\r\npink berries, that were found growing wild, were named and sent out.\r\nThese novelties are yet cultivated by a few amateur horticulturists. It\r\nmay seem strange to say that we have white and red blackberries, but it\r\nis a fact. At this date we have many kinds of later introduction, some\r\nearly and some late, and of most delicious flavor.\r\n\r\nPerhaps all Americans know that cranberry sauce goes with Thanksgiving\r\nturkey. No country in the world has so many cranberries as North\r\nAmerica. The bogs of Cape Cod are famous for this fruit, and the\r\nPilgrims of Plymouth colony knew of them, and served them on their\r\nrustic tables. Now the wild marshes along the Atlantic are nearly all\r\nunder cultivation, and the product has been increased many fold. Fully\r\n1,000,000 bushels are marketed when the crop is good. The same is being\r\ndone with the bogs in the vicinity of the Great Lakes. Cranberries grow\r\nin untold quantities on the marshes of Alaska.\r\n\r\nCITRUS FRUITS.—When the Spaniards invaded Florida in search of gold\r\nthey brought with them seeds of the citrus fruits from the regions\r\nof the Mediterranean. There the orange, lemon, and lime were planted\r\nin the genial climate of our Southern borders. The fruit was carried\r\nhither and thither, and soon escaped the bounds of the cultivated\r\nareas. The forests in places were filled with wild orange trees, the\r\nmost of which bore fruit of poor quality. When the tide of immigration\r\nset southward after the Civil War, these wild groves were budded\r\nto good varieties, and new land was cleared and planted with small\r\nseedlings. These were budded to good varieties in due time. Orange\r\nculture was soon a fixed industry in Florida. This increased rapidly up\r\nto the time of the severe freeze of 1894–95, when there were shipped\r\nover 5,000,000 boxes. Since then the results of the freezing of the\r\ntrees has greatly lessened the product, but it is steadily increasing\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe lemon has attracted much less interest than the orange, but I have\r\nseen one lemon orchard in Florida of more than two hundred acres, and\r\nthere are many smaller ones.\r\n\r\nThe lime is but little called for, and is therefore grown more as a\r\nnovelty than for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nThe pomelo, by some misnamed “grape-fruit,” is a very large, wholesome,\r\nand delicious citrus fruit that is becoming quite popular where it\r\ngrows, and in the northern markets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ORANGE ORCHARD OF LYMAN PHELPS, SANFORD, FLA.]\r\n\r\nIn California the orange was first planted by the mission fathers\r\ncenturies ago. The first real orchard is said to have been planted at\r\nSan Gabriel in 1804. Before the discovery of gold in that far-away\r\nregion very few orange orchards existed there, and they were of small\r\nsize. Up to 1872 very little more than this was done, when the founding\r\nof the colony at Riverside, and the fortunate introduction of the Bahia\r\nor Navel orange from Brazil by our government, at this juncture, was\r\nthe start of prosperous citrus culture on that coast. Now there are\r\nannually about 5,000,000 boxes of oranges sent out of that State alone,\r\nand the amount is steadily increasing. A large part of these are of the\r\njustly famous Navel variety.\r\n\r\nLemon growing is also becoming a great industry there. Orchards of one\r\nhundred acres are rather common, and some are fully five times larger.\r\nOver 2,000,000 boxes of lemons were produced the past season.\r\n\r\nTHE OLIVE.—Among the historic fruits of Palestine and southern Europe\r\nthe olive holds a conspicuous place. Numerous but futile attempts were\r\nmade in early times to establish it in Virginia and along the Atlantic\r\ncoast, the climate there proving unsuitable. But in the warmer parts of\r\nCalifornia the olive is perfectly at home. The first olive orchard of\r\nconsequence was planted by Ellwood Cooper, at Santa Barbara, in 1872,\r\nand in 1876 he made oil from the fruit grown on the trees. Now there\r\nare many extensive orchards in many parts of the State. It is estimated\r\nthat there are nearly 2,000,000 olive trees now growing in that State.\r\nThe oil and pickled fruit are steadily becoming popular in our fancy\r\nmarkets in competition with the foreign product.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLIVE ORCHARD, QUITO RANCH, NEAR SAN JOSE, CAL.]\r\n\r\nTHE FIG.—Very little is done in fig culture east of California,\r\nalthough the trees are not tender along the Gulf coast, except in case\r\nof extremely severe winters. In California it is a decided success,\r\ncommercially as well as for mere pleasure. The past year dried figs\r\nto the amount of nearly 4,000,000 pounds were sent to market, and the\r\nquantity has been constantly increasing for several years.\r\n\r\nTHE PINEAPPLE.—Those who have never seen pineapples growing are apt\r\nto think they are produced on trees. This is far from the fact. They\r\ngrow on the tips of stalks about two feet high. The plants have large\r\nnarrow leaves that cluster at the ground, from the centre of which\r\nthese stalks spring. A few patches were planted on the islands near\r\nthe Florida coast in 1860, but it is only about fifteen years since\r\nthe first vigorous attempts were made to grow this delicious fruit in\r\nthe United States. Florida is the only region within our country where\r\nthe climate is sufficiently moist and warm for it to flourish. Along\r\nthe east coast, from Rock Ledge southward, and on the west coast below\r\nTampa, are the most favorable sections. Many acres are devoted to\r\nits culture there. Frosts damage the plants sometimes, but they soon\r\nrecover. In central Florida, many acres are grown under sheds. These\r\nare made of frame-work, which is covered with slats or boughs as a\r\nprotection from frost. Upwards of 3,000,000 fruits of marketable size\r\nare now produced in Florida annually.\r\n\r\nOTHER FRUITS.—The date is just beginning to be set in the arid regions\r\nof Arizona and southern California, and with good prospects of success.\r\nAlready many trees are in bearing, and the fruit is of excellent\r\nquality. The choicest varieties have been imported from Africa. The\r\nguava is being grown in the warm parts of Florida and California. The\r\nmango has been fruited in the warmest parts of Florida and California.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PINEAPPLE FIELD AT PALM BEACH, FLA.]\r\n\r\nNUTS.—The sweet almond of southern Europe has long been tested in\r\nAmerica, but nowhere with success except in California, where there are\r\nalmond orchards of several hundred acres each. The Persian (wrongly\r\ncalled English) walnut is a great success in the richer lands of\r\nCalifornia, where orchards of majestic trees have been in full bearing\r\nfor many years. Of our native nuts the pecan is the best of all, and\r\nit is about the only one that has so far proved worthy of cultivation.\r\nIt is found in a wild state in Illinois, Missouri, and Nebraska, and\r\nsouthward to the Gulf of Mexico. The creek and river bottoms suit it\r\nbest, but it will do very well on almost any rich land. On some of\r\nthe hammock lands of Florida hundreds of acres are now planted to\r\nthe pecan. The largest pecan orchard is that of F. A. Swinden, of\r\nBrownwood, Texas, which covers over five hundred acres, and is being\r\nincreased from year to year.\r\n\r\nOur native chestnut is of better quality than the foreign kinds, but\r\nthe nuts are much smaller. The largest are from Japan, some of which\r\nare two inches in diameter. Many of these choice kinds have been\r\nimported, and others were originated from seeds, which are now being\r\nplanted in orchards. The best of the European chestnuts have also been\r\nimported, and new kinds have been grown here from the nuts. Nearly all\r\nof these varieties succeed in America, and many small orchards have\r\nbeen planted. Some have grafted sprouts from our native chestnut stumps\r\nand small trees with these improved kinds, and found them to grow and\r\nbear abundantly.\r\n\r\nThe cocoanut is strictly tropical, and can only be grown in the very\r\nwarmest parts of Florida. It will not endure as low a temperature as\r\nthe pineapple without injury. As a commercial venture its culture will\r\nprobably never pay in America, but for ornamental purposes and as an\r\ninteresting novelty it is already a success from Lake Worth southward.\r\nThe waving plumes of this giant palm are a source of constant delight\r\nto those who are privileged to see them. The huge clusters of nuts are\r\nindeed an interesting sight.\r\n\r\nSurely we have a great and fruitful country, from the cranberry bogs of\r\narctic Alaska to the waving cocoanut groves of Florida. This century\r\ncloses and the new one begins with wonderful advances in fruit culture\r\nbeyond those of a hundred years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CENTURY’S COMMERCIAL PROGRESS\r\n\r\nBY EMORY R. JOHNSON, A.M.,\r\n\r\n_Asst. Prof. of Transportation and Commerce, University of\r\nPennsylvania_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCommercial activity has three phases, trade, shipping, and\r\nshipbuilding. In each of these three phases of commerce the nineteenth\r\ncentury has witnessed a remarkable progress. The expansion of both\r\ndomestic and international trade has far exceeded the anticipations of\r\nthose who lived a hundred years ago; and the agencies of transportation\r\nby water, the numerous auxiliaries of commerce and the shipbuilding\r\nindustries, have undergone a technical revolution so complete, and\r\nwith consequences so beneficent to our social and industrial life,\r\nas to make the commercial progress of the past hundred years one of\r\nthe salient features of the history of the century. We shall better\r\nappreciate the nature and scope of the commercial progress of the past\r\nhundred years, if we glance for a moment at a picture of the commerce\r\nof the world at the close of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. MAIN FEATURES OF THE WORLD’S COMMERCE AT THE CLOSE OF THE EIGHTEENTH\r\nCENTURY.\r\n\r\nA hundred years ago, the volume of trade, both domestic and foreign,\r\nwas necessarily kept within proportions relatively small as compared\r\nwith present traffic, because of the slowness and high costs of inland\r\ntransportation. Domestic inland traffic is directly dependent upon\r\nfacilities for water and land transportation, and until the railroad\r\ncame into use, some seventy years ago, only those countries having\r\nnumerous navigable rivers or well-developed canal systems could extend\r\ntheir commerce much beyond the cities and districts adjacent to tide\r\nwater. In all ages since the world became civilized enough to engage\r\nin commerce, an overland traffic by caravan or wagon has been carried\r\non; but the amount of commodities could not be large, and the kinds of\r\ngoods transported were necessarily limited to articles of high value\r\nper unit of bulk or weight. Such an inland traffic as this did not\r\nestablish the basis for a large coastwise or over-sea commerce.\r\n\r\nAt present, bulky commodities produced long distances from the\r\nsea-ports comprise a large portion of international traffic, and supply\r\nthe coast cities with the raw materials from which they manufacture\r\nthe articles they contribute to swell the volume of foreign trade.\r\nWhen the means were wanting for the inland transportation of these\r\nbulky commodities, only a few countries, such as Phœnicia, the Italian\r\ncities, Portugal, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the British\r\ncolonies in America, could develop an important maritime commerce.\r\nDuring the past fifty years, the improvements in transportation have\r\nbeen such as to enable all industrial countries, inland as well as\r\nmaritime, to engage extensively in the world’s trade. Commerce has\r\nbecome general; and countries like Switzerland and Saxony readily\r\nmarket their wares the world over.\r\n\r\nThe volume of foreign trade, as late as a hundred years ago, was\r\nreally small, even in the case of the most important commercial\r\nnations. The imports and exports of the United Kingdom in 1800 amounted\r\nto about $360,000,000, which, for a population of approximately\r\n18,000,000, would be about $20 per capita. At that time the trade of\r\nthe United Kingdom was about one tenth what it is now. At the present\r\ntime the foreign commerce of the United Kingdom amounts to nearly $100\r\nfor each inhabitant of the country.\r\n\r\nThe thirteen British colonies in America and the original commonwealths\r\nof the United States were all maritime States with navigable rivers,\r\nand their industries, lumbering, fisheries, production of food\r\nproducts and tobacco, called for the exchange of large quantities\r\nof commodities with the manufacturers of the home country, and with\r\nthe tropical islands of the West Indies. For their time, then, these\r\nStates were large traders. The statistical information which we\r\npossess of their commerce is meagre, but we know that the total trade\r\nof the colonies with the mother country in 1770 was about $13,000,000\r\na year, or something over four dollars per person. There was a trade\r\nof considerable proportions with the West Indies, some with the\r\nMediterranean countries and Africa, and, after the colonies became\r\nStates, with the East Indies and the Orient; but in all probability the\r\nforeign trade of the Americans did not reach ten dollars per capita\r\nuntil after 1790. At the present time, in spite of the very rapid\r\ngrowth of population in the United States that has continued throughout\r\nthe nineteenth century, our foreign trade is equal to twenty-five\r\ndollars per person.\r\n\r\nIt is when the commerce of the eighteenth century is viewed from the\r\nstandpoint of the transportation agencies by which it was served—the\r\nsize, speed, and efficiency of the ships—that the contrast with\r\npresent conditions becomes most striking. Two hundred years ago, the\r\n560 ships owned at London averaged 157 tons. A century ago, a vessel\r\nof 300 tons was still considered a large ship, and as late as 1840\r\nvessels of that size traded from the United States to India and China.\r\nThe Grand Turk, of 564 tons, built in 1791, was probably the largest\r\nship built in America up to that time. During the fourth decade of the\r\nnineteenth century numerous vessels of over 1000 tons were constructed,\r\nand in 1840 the Great Britain of 3000 tons was ordered. In her day\r\nthe Great Britain was more of a marvel than is the recently launched\r\nOceanic, of 28,500 tons displacement.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider that these small vessels in use a century ago took\r\nfrom a month to six weeks to cross the Atlantic,—their speed being\r\nabout one third that of the freight steamers of to-day,—we realize\r\nthe great difference in the efficiency of the merchant marine of the\r\npresent as compared with that by which commerce was served in 1800.\r\nThe efficiency of the ships, however, does not depend alone upon their\r\nsize and speed. The commercial auxiliaries which enable vessels to\r\nenter and clear harbors without delay, and to load and unload cargoes\r\nquickly,—lighthouses, beacons, buoys, spacious wharves and docks\r\nequipped with mechanical appliances for handling freight,—make it\r\npossible for vessels to spend a greater portion of the time at sea. A\r\nmerchant marine to-day has fully five times the efficiency that one\r\nwith an equal tonnage had a century ago. We shall better see how this\r\nhas been brought about, by briefly reviewing the technical revolution\r\nwhich has taken place in ocean navigation during the past seventy\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE CENTURY’S TECHNICAL REVOLUTION IN COMMERCE.\r\n\r\nDuring the first four decades of this century the wooden sailing\r\nvessel was the sole carrier of ocean traffic, and in the construction\r\nand operation of such ships the Americans had special advantages and\r\nmanifested peculiar ingenuity. For forty years the American sailing\r\nclipper, whose fine lines made it stanch and speedy, had been “the type\r\nand model of excellence in ship-building;” but before the middle of the\r\ncentury the supremacy of the wooden clipper-ship had been destroyed,\r\nand the technical superiority of steam and iron had been demonstrated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CLIPPER SHIP.]\r\n\r\nThere are six distinct steps in the technical evolution of the ocean\r\nliner of the present day,—six changes which mark the epochs in the\r\nhistory of the substitution of steam and steel for sail and wood. The\r\nfirst step in the evolution was taken when the steam engine and the\r\npaddle-wheel took the place of wind and sails. Like most epoch-making\r\nchanges, this one was made slowly; indeed, it was preceded by thirty\r\nyears of hesitation and conservative experimentation. Robert Fulton,\r\ntaking advantage of ideas and plans which he had obtained in Europe,\r\nproduced his Clermont in 1807, and demonstrated the practicability\r\nof the steamship for river traffic. Five years later, Henry Bell of\r\nScotland constructed the Comet, the first passenger steamboat built in\r\nEurope, a vessel only forty feet long, ten and one half feet in width,\r\nand of four horse-power. The Clermont was somewhat larger, having a\r\nlength of 130 feet, a beam of eighteen feet, and a hold six feet in\r\ndepth. She succeeded in making five miles an hour against stream.\r\nThese little vessels attracted great attention, and the problem of\r\nconstructing ships that could cross the ocean by steam power began to\r\nbe studied. In 1819, the Savannah was fitted with engines and crossed\r\nthe Atlantic, using both steam power and sails, but the vessel did not\r\nprove a success, and her engines were taken out the following year.\r\nIndeed, it was not until 1833 that a vessel steamed all the way across\r\nthe Atlantic; and this ship, the Royal William, a Canadian craft of\r\nfour or five hundred tons, was able to make the trip from Quebec to\r\nGravesend on the Thames only by stopping for coal at Picton, Nova\r\nScotia, and Cowes near Portsmouth, England.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBERT FULTON.]\r\n\r\nThe first steamships to cross the ocean without recoaling were the\r\nSirius and Great Western, which arrived in New York the same day, April\r\n23, 1838, the former vessel having sailed from London and the latter\r\nfrom Liverpool. This achievement on the part of these two wooden craft,\r\nneither one capable of carrying more than seven hundred tons, created\r\na great impression. The New York “Courier and Enquirer” said, in its\r\nissue of April 24, 1838:—\r\n\r\n“What may be the ultimate fate of this excitement—whether or not the\r\nexpense of equipment and fuel will admit of the employment of these\r\nvessels in the ordinary packet service—we cannot pretend to form an\r\nopinion; but of the entire feasibility of the passage of the Atlantic\r\nby steam, as far as regards safety, comfort, and dispatch, even in the\r\nroughest and most boisterous weather, the most skeptical man must now\r\ncease to doubt.”\r\n\r\nThe employment of steamships in the regular packet service was assured\r\nin 1839, when Samuel Cunard founded the famous English line that still\r\nbears his name, and ordered four steamers of moderate size that cost\r\nbetween four and five hundred thousand dollars each. These, however,\r\nwere wooden vessels, and it was not until 1856 that the conservative\r\nCunards constructed any iron ships.\r\n\r\nThe construction of iron ships for ocean navigation marks the second\r\nimportant phase of the technical evolution of the past century’s\r\ncommerce. It began on a small scale about 1830, and in 1837 an iron\r\nvessel, The Rainbow, of six hundred tons was built; but the first\r\nlarge iron steamer was ordered in 1840, and was the famous Great\r\nBritain before referred to, constructed by Brunel, the engineer who\r\nsubsequently built the unfortunate naval monstrosity, the Great\r\nEastern. The completion of the Great Britain, in 1843, was an important\r\nevent in the progress of ocean navigation, not only because she was\r\nfive times the size of her largest iron predecessor, but also because\r\nof the fact that Brunel decided, while building the vessel, to adopt\r\nthe screw for propelling the ship.\r\n\r\nThe substitution of the screw instead of paddle-wheels represents\r\na third phase of the technical evolution of ocean navigation. John\r\nEricsson, who subsequently built the famous Monitor, had demonstrated\r\nthe practicability of the screw as a propeller in 1836, and, three\r\nyears later, the Archimedes, of two hundred and thirty-seven tons, was\r\nfitted with a screw. It was the success of the Archimedes that led\r\nBrunel to adopt the screw on the Great Britain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CLERMONT. FULTON’S FIRST STEAMBOAT.]\r\n\r\nThe superiority of the screw over paddle-wheels, and the greater merits\r\nof iron ships compared with wooden vessels, have long been accepted;\r\nbut the adoption of iron as a material and of the screw for a propeller\r\ncame about slowly. Indeed, iron ship-building made little progress in\r\nGreat Britain before 1850, and in this country wood was adhered to till\r\nmuch later. One reason why the English did not change to the screw\r\nand iron more quickly was probably the great influence exerted by the\r\npowerful Cunard line, whose conservatism caused it to hold to wooden\r\nships until 1856. The Great Eastern, finished as late as 1859, was an\r\niron ship, but was fitted with both screw and paddle-wheels. Of the\r\ntotal tonnage built in the United Kingdom in 1853, about twenty-five\r\nper cent was steam tonnage and a little more than twenty-five per cent\r\nwas of iron. At the present time three fourths of all British-built\r\nvessels are steamers, and no wooden ships are built in the United\r\nKingdom.\r\n\r\nAmerica was slow in changing from wood to iron, because the cost of\r\niron was so high. We had wood in abundance, numerous yards for the\r\nconstruction of wooden vessels, and were the builders of the best\r\ntype of wooden ships. In 1853, the year just referred to for Great\r\nBritain, twenty-two per cent of the tonnage of the vessels built in\r\nthis country was in steamships, but only an inappreciable portion was\r\nin iron vessels. The adherence of American ship-builders and owners\r\nto wood is well illustrated by the action taken by the owners of the\r\nfamous but unfortunate American Collins line, established in 1847. The\r\ncompany began, in 1850, to run four palatial steamers, built without\r\nregard to cost, and supplied with luxurious appointments, some of which\r\nare retained in vessels of the present day; but the company built the\r\nships of wood and propelled them with paddle-wheels. The great American\r\nship-building firm, William Cramp & Sons, founded in 1850, did not\r\nbegin constructing iron ships till 1870. Even in 1898, the tonnage of\r\nwooden vessels constructed was one and a half times the steel and iron\r\ntonnage. About twenty-six per cent of our merchant marine, foreign and\r\ndomestic, is now made up of iron and steel vessels.\r\n\r\nThe next important step in maritime progress, following the adoption\r\nof iron and the screw, was taken about 1870, when the compound engine\r\ncame into general use. Though the compound engine had been used on\r\na small vessel in France as early as 1829, it was first extensively\r\nadopted as the result of the rapid development in steam navigation\r\nwhich took place in the seventies. In the compound engine the steam,\r\ninstead of being used in only one cylinder in passing from the boiler\r\nto the condenser, exerts its force in two or three cylinders, and even\r\nin four, in the quadruple expansion engines. This results in a great\r\neconomy in the amount of fuel used. In the earlier marine engines the\r\npressure of steam in the boilers was thirteen pounds to the square\r\ninch, and the consumption of coal per horse-power per hour was five\r\nand one half pounds; whereas, at the present time, a pressure of two\r\nhundred pounds per square inch is maintained, and the fuel used has\r\nbeen reduced to less than one and a half pounds per hour for each\r\nindicated horse-power.\r\n\r\nTen years after the compound engine came into general use, the\r\ncheapened cost of steel made it possible to adopt steel in the place\r\nof iron in the construction of hulls. This may be regarded as marking\r\na fifth epoch-making step in the progress of commerce; because the\r\nsteel ship was stronger, lighter, and able to carry more cargo than\r\niron vessels of the same size. The substitution of steel for iron in\r\nthe British yards was made rapidly. In 1879, only ten and a quarter per\r\ncent of the tonnage constructed on the Clyde was of steel; but in 1889\r\nthe per cent had risen to ninety-seven.\r\n\r\nDuring the past twenty years there have been many improvements made\r\nin the construction and appointments of ships; but the more important\r\nchanges have consisted in dividing vessels, by means of bulkheads,\r\ninto several water-tight compartments, and in substituting twin screws\r\nfor the single screw. The Inmans placed twin screws on the City of New\r\nYork in 1888, and since then their use has become general on the larger\r\nocean liners. The twin screws add somewhat, though not greatly, to the\r\nspeed of vessels; but they render ships much safer and less liable\r\nto be disabled. An ocean steamer with twin screws and water-tight\r\ncompartments can suffer any one of the common accidents—such as\r\nbreaking of one of its shafts, losing one of its screws, having its\r\nrudder damaged, or one of its engines give out, or having its side\r\npunctured by collision—without being disabled. Although ocean travel\r\nstill has its dangers, the risks at the present time are far less than\r\nthey were a half or a quarter of a century ago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe technical progress of commerce during the nineteenth century is\r\nwell summarized by Mr. Henry Fry in his book on the History of North\r\nAtlantic Steam Navigation, written in 1895. He says:—\r\n\r\n“The Comet of 1812 has multiplied into twelve thousand steamships,\r\nmeasuring over sixteen million tons.... Her twenty tons have been\r\nmultiplied into a ship of eighteen thousand; her forty feet to six\r\nhundred and ninety-two feet; and her four horse-power to thirty\r\nthousand in a single ship. Symington’s four-inch cylinder has grown\r\nto one hundred and twenty inches; the pressure of steam in the boiler\r\nhas increased from thirteen pounds to two hundred pounds on the square\r\ninch; the two hundred and forty-three knots, the maximum of the Great\r\nWestern in 1838, to five hundred and sixty; and the average speed\r\nfrom 8.2 to 22.01 knots, while the consumption of coal has decreased\r\nfrom about five and one half to one and one half pounds per indicated\r\nhorse-power per hour.”\r\n\r\nThe century’s naval technical progress is epitomized in the White\r\nStar liner, the Oceanic. The length of this mammoth vessel is over an\r\neighth of a mile, being 705 feet, 6 inches. 13½ feet longer than the\r\nGreat Eastern was. When loaded, the Oceanic draws 32 feet, 6 inches of\r\nwater, and on that draft her displacement is 28,500 tons. The figures\r\nfor the Great Eastern were 25 feet, 6 inches, and 27,000 tons. The\r\ncapacity of her engines is 28,000 horse-power, or two and one third\r\ntimes the capacity of those in the Great Eastern. The pressure in her\r\nboilers is 192 pounds to the square inch, or ten or twelve times that\r\nin the boilers of her famous predecessor. Though not built for speed,\r\nthe Oceanic can average 500 miles a day, or sixty per cent more than\r\nthe Great Eastern did. The Oceanic will accommodate 400 first-class\r\npassengers, 300 second-class, 1000 third-class, and a ship’s company\r\nof 394, making a total of 2104 persons. In this regard, however, her\r\nfigures are fortunately less than those of the Great Eastern, for that\r\nvessel was designed to carry 4000 persons, besides crew. These figures\r\nregarding passenger accommodations indicate in a forceful way the great\r\nadvancement that has been made in the comforts of ocean travel during\r\nthe past forty years.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. IMPROVEMENTS IN COMMERCIAL AUXILIARIES.\r\n\r\nThe progress of commerce during the nineteenth century has been\r\npromoted not only by the evolution of ships of great speed and\r\ncapacity, but also by the improvements made in numerous other\r\nauxiliaries of commerce. Chief among these aids to commercial activity\r\nhave been the betterment of natural waterways and the construction of\r\nship-canals, the improvements of harbors, the laying of cables, and the\r\nextension of international banking facilities.\r\n\r\nThe improvements of such rivers as the Rhine, Danube, Hudson, and\r\nMississippi, and of such natural waterways as the chain of Great Lakes\r\nin the northern part of the United States, are conspicuous instances\r\nof the manner in which the canalization of natural waterways has been\r\nundertaken for the promotion of traffic. That part of the Rhine River\r\ntraffic which passes Emmerich and Mannheim amounted to 2,800,000 tons\r\na year from 1872 to 1875, but by 1895 it had increased to 10,300,000\r\ntons. The traffic on the rivers of the Mississippi Valley, according\r\nto census statistics, increased from 18,946,522 tons, in 1880, to\r\n29,485,046 tons, in 1889; and since that year the increase must have\r\nbeen considerable. The effect of the improvement of waterways upon\r\ncommerce is most strikingly shown in the case of our Great Lakes. In\r\nthe seventies, the demands of traffic were for channels and harbors\r\n12 feet in depth. During the next decade it was necessary for the\r\nUnited States to increase the depth to 16 feet; and in the nineties the\r\nchannels had to be made deep enough to accommodate vessels of 20 feet\r\ndraft. At the present time the traffic on the Lakes is probably over\r\n70,000,000 tons annually. During the year 1898 the freight that passed\r\nthe locks at the Sault St. Marie equaled 21,000,000 tons, two and a\r\nhalf times the tonnage passing the Suez Canal.\r\n\r\nDuring the last third of the nineteenth century six important ocean\r\nship-canals have been opened; the Suez, opened in 1869; the Rotterdam\r\nCanal, in 1872; the canal connecting Amsterdam directly with the\r\nNorth Sea, 1877; the canal across the Isthmus of Corinth, 1893; the\r\nManchester Canal, 1894; and the Baltic or Kiel Canal, finished in\r\n1895. The Panama Canal was begun in 1882, and the construction of the\r\nNicaragua Canal was commenced in 1889; but the date of the completion\r\nof these most important works is still problematical.\r\n\r\nIn the improvement of its harbors every government has been active.\r\nThirty years ago a depth of 23 feet was considered ample, but after\r\n1880 it became necessary to adopt 27 feet as the standard. During the\r\npast five years the larger seaports have required harbors with 30 feet\r\nof water in order to accommodate the largest ocean vessels, and the\r\nlimit has by no means been reached. The United States Government has\r\njust recently, 1899, authorized the deepening of New York harbor to 35\r\nfeet. As noted before, the Oceanic can be loaded to a draft of 32½ feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OCEANIC, 1899. LARGEST SHIP AFLOAT.\r\n\r\n(Tonnage, 17,000: length, 705 ft. 6 in.; breadth, 68 ft. 4 in.)]\r\n\r\nThe docks of the great seaports have been improved at a cost of many\r\nmillions of dollars. As an illustration of this Liverpool may be cited.\r\nThe city’s position gave it great commercial possibilities, but a\r\ntroublesome bar at the mouth of the Mersey, and a tide with a rise and\r\nfall of thirty feet made the construction of its harbor and docks a\r\ndifficult matter. The problem was solved by the construction, under\r\npublic control, of a large number of commodious wet docks with gates\r\nwhich are opened only a few hours a day, during high tide. These harbor\r\nimprovements have made possible Liverpool’s phenomenal expansion in\r\ncommerce during the past quarter of a century, an increase that has\r\ngiven the city third place among the seaports of the world, with an\r\nannual tonnage of vessels entered and cleared of 16,000,000 tons.\r\n\r\nThe achievements of Manchester during the past decade are even more\r\nnotable than those of Liverpool. Manchester is situated on a small\r\nstream thirty-five miles from the ocean; but she has become a seaport\r\nfor the largest ocean vessels, and has docks and wharves equipped with\r\nthe most improved appliances. Her dock-sheds, for instance, are twin\r\nstructures, three stories in height, and the arrangements for handling\r\nfreight are such that goods are taken directly from the ships to any\r\none of the three stories of the sheds.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, the government and private corporations are\r\nrapidly improving the harbor facilities of our ports. During the past\r\ndecade the Gulf ports have received especial attention, with the\r\nresult that a large part of our export trade is now moving through the\r\nGulf harbors. As an instance of what private corporations are doing,\r\nmention may be made of the fact that a railway corporation has recently\r\ncompleted a wharf in New Orleans that cost $2,000,000.\r\n\r\nBesides these harbor improvements, the erection of more and better\r\nlighthouses and signals has made the approach of vessels safer. The\r\nUnited States Weather Bureau has also done much to lessen the dangers\r\nof navigation by its weather forecasts and its warnings of approaching\r\nstorms. Although the Bureau was established only twenty-nine years\r\nago, and in a small way, its services have so increased and in such a\r\npractical manner as to have come to be regarded as indispensable by the\r\ncommercial interests.\r\n\r\nThe first successful trans-Atlantic cable was laid in 1866; at the\r\npresent time there are 170,000 miles of submarine telegraphs in\r\nuse. The cables now used for commercial purposes number 320 and\r\ninclude about 150,000 miles of lines, the other 20,000 miles being\r\nshort government lines connecting forts, batteries, signal-stations,\r\nand lighthouses. The total cost of these cables has been about\r\n$250,000,000. The influence of the cable upon commerce has been so\r\ngreat as to revolutionize the methods of international trade that\r\nprevailed a century ago; indeed, ocean telegraphy has made it no more\r\ndifficult to effect international sales and purchases than it is to\r\nmake domestic exchanges. With thirteen cables in successful operation\r\nbetween the United States and Europe, we have had no difficulty\r\nin building up an immense trade across the Atlantic; but, with no\r\ntrans-Pacific line, we are experiencing much difficulty in securing a\r\nlarge place in the trade of the Orient. Of course the development of\r\nour commerce with the East is conditioned by numerous other factors;\r\nbut no one doubts that the construction of the proposed Pacific cable\r\nwill be of assistance to our commercial progress in the Orient.\r\n\r\nAmong the other agencies that have promoted the progress of\r\ncommerce, mention should be made of the extension and improvement of\r\ninternational credit systems and banking facilities. In this regard\r\nthe United Kingdom leads the nations of the world, London being the\r\nclearing-house for a large part of the world’s trade. Germany,\r\nFrance, and the Netherlands have also developed good facilities for\r\ninternational banking; but the United States has not yet done so. Our\r\nmerchants are still obliged to settle most accounts through foreign\r\nbanks, but it is probable that our recent acquisition of foreign\r\npossessions will cause us to establish some system of international\r\nbanks.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. EXPANSION OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE DURING THE CENTURY.\r\n\r\nIn the introductory paragraph of this paper it was stated that the\r\ncommercial progress of the past hundred years is one of the salient\r\nfeatures of the history of the century; and, in contrasting the\r\ncommerce of a hundred years ago with that of the present, a few figures\r\nwere cited that indicated in a general way the growth that the foreign\r\ntrade of Great Britain and the United States has enjoyed. The expansion\r\nof international trade during the century merits fuller presentation\r\nand analysis.\r\n\r\nAccurate figures for the whole world’s trade are not obtainable for\r\nthe earlier years; and if it were possible to present comparative\r\nstatistics of the international trade of the world, as a whole, the\r\ncomparisons would not be so instructive as those which present the\r\nprogress of the commerce of those countries which rank highest among\r\ntrading nations. Accordingly it will be most profitable to confine\r\nour statistics and analytical study to the commerce of Great Britain,\r\nGermany, France, and the United States.\r\n\r\nThe progress which the commerce of the United Kingdom has made during\r\nthe century is shown by the following table, giving the imports,\r\nexports, and total trade for the years 1800, 1839, 1897, and the annual\r\naverage for alternate quinquennial periods between 1855 and 1890.\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING GROWTH OF COMMERCE OF THE UNITED KINGDOM.\r\n\r\n  --------+---------------+---------------+--------------\r\n   Years. |    Imports.   |    Exports.   | Total Trade.\r\n  --------+---------------+---------------+--------------\r\n  1800    |  $148,876,000 |  $210,240,000 |  $359,116,000\r\n  1839    |   300,474,000 |   321,564,000 |   622,038,000\r\n  1856–60 |   890,723,000 |   604,854,000 | 1,495,577,000\r\n  1866–70 | 1,425,936,000 |   914,586,000 | 2,340,522,000\r\n  1876–80 | 1,862,775,000 |   980,818,000 | 2,843,593,000\r\n  1886–90 | 1,897,352,000 | 1,453,695,000 | 3,351,047,000\r\n  1897    | 2,194,932,524 | 1,431,598,345 | 3,626,530,869\r\n  --------+---------------+---------------+--------------\r\n\r\nDuring the first four decades of the century, the growth of the\r\ncommerce of the United Kingdom, though considerable, was not\r\nrapid,—the figures for 1839 showing an increase of 73 per cent over\r\nthose for 1800,—but during the fifth, sixth, and seventh decades the\r\nprogress was phenomenal. The value of the exports in 1873, as compared\r\nwith 1839, shows a gain of 379 per cent, and the total foreign trade\r\nincreased nearly 450 per cent; that is, it was five and a half times\r\nas much in 1873 as it was thirty-four years previous. Since 1880, the\r\nquantities of imports and exports have largely increased, but the fall\r\nin prices has been such as to make the increase in the total value\r\ncomparatively small.\r\n\r\nThe commerce of the German States during the nineteenth century did\r\nnot grow very rapidly until after 1850. During the early part of the\r\ncentury the great Continental wars rendered commerce nearly impossible.\r\nPeace was restored in 1815, but the German States had neither political\r\nnor commercial unity. Each State had a tariff which applied against all\r\nother States. Gradually a Zollverein, or customs union, grew up, which,\r\nby 1854, had come to include all the German States except Austria,\r\nHolstein, Mecklenburg, Lauenburg, and the three Hanse towns, Hamburg,\r\nLübeck, and Bremen. In 1866, the North German Federation was organized,\r\nand this paved the way for the formation of the German Empire in 1871.\r\nThe Zollverein made commercial progress possible, and political unity\r\ngave it a great impulse.\r\n\r\nThe statistics of the German trade before the establishment of the\r\nZollverein are very meagre. A German authority, Otto Huebner, estimates\r\nthe value of the total import and export trade of the German States to\r\nhave been $309,019,200 in 1850, and $504,988,200 in 1855. The value\r\nof the imports of Hamburg, the chief port of Germany, rose from an\r\nannual average of $92,320,050 for the five-year period 1851–55, to\r\n$157,660,472 during the half decade 1866–70. The growth of Germany’s\r\nforeign commerce during the past twenty years has been phenomenal, and\r\nher trade is now second only to that of Great Britain. In 1881, the\r\nimports were valued at $704,904,000, and the exports at $707,978,000,\r\nbeing slightly more than the imports; whereas, by 1890, the imports had\r\nrisen to $986,641,000, and the exports to $792,620,000, a sum nearly a\r\nhundred million dollars less than the value of the imports. The foreign\r\ntrade of the country, particularly in imports, has continued its rapid\r\ngrowth since 1890, the figures for 1897 being, imports $1,231,756,862,\r\nand exports $977,447,198, a total trade of $2,209,204,060.\r\n\r\nThe foreign trade of France at the beginning of the nineteenth century\r\nconsisted of $80,500,000 worth of imports and $59,000,000 of exports,\r\na total of $139,500,000. The Continental wars, up to 1815, were even\r\nmore disastrous to French trade than they were to German; but with the\r\nrestoration of peace, commercial progress began, and between 1815 and\r\n1831 the total trade increased from $119,200,000 worth to $168,152,000\r\nworth. The growth by decades since 1830 has been as follows: In 1840,\r\nthe value of the total foreign trade was $278,383,200; in 1850,\r\n$358,748,400; in 1860, $805,659,200; in 1871, $1,242,765,600; in 1880,\r\n$1,640,712,300; and in 1890, $2,003,557,516. These figures show that\r\nthe rapid expansion of French commerce began about 1850. The highest\r\npoint was reached in 1891; but since then there has been a slight\r\nfalling off in the total trade, due to a decrease in imports. In 1891,\r\nthe value of the imports was $1,155,973,310; in 1897, $991,537,500. The\r\nexports were valued at $920,839,130 in 1891; and at $926,998,300 in\r\n1897. The total trade for these years was $2,076,812,440 for 1891, and\r\n$1,918,535,800 for 1897.\r\n\r\nDuring the first quarter of the century France had a strong balance of\r\ntrade in her favor: that is, she sold more commodities than she bought;\r\nand between 1825 and 1840 the exports and imports about balanced each\r\nother; but since that date, with the exception of the years 1871 to\r\n1875, when the huge war indemnity was paid, the balance of trade had\r\nbeen unfavorable, as would naturally be expected of a country such as\r\nFrance, whose people are extensively engaged in manufacturing. France,\r\nas well as the United Kingdom, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, and\r\nother European countries, imports raw materials and food in large\r\nquantities.\r\n\r\nThe decline in the value of French trade, though due to falling prices\r\nrather than to a decrease in the quantities of commodities, has given\r\nthe French people much concern. It is not probable, however, that this\r\ndecline is due to permanent causes. The population and industries\r\nof France have not reached a stationary stage; they are going to\r\nincrease and cause a natural growth in the country’s foreign commerce.\r\nThe commercial progress of France, however, can hardly be so rapid\r\nas that of Germany and the United States. These are the countries\r\nwhose commercial vitality is strongest, and of these two countries,\r\nthe United States possesses greater natural resources and larger\r\npossibilities, industrial and commercial. The progress of the commerce\r\nof the United States merits a somewhat closer survey than has been\r\ngiven its three leading rivals in trade.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. THE TRADE OF THE UNITED STATES DURING THE CENTURY.\r\n\r\nThe economic progress of the United States during the past hundred\r\nyears is most clearly indicated by the growth of its foreign and\r\ndomestic commerce. Being a new country, busied with occupying and\r\ndeveloping our large territory, our domestic commerce has been of\r\nenormous proportions. With nearly two hundred thousand miles of\r\nrailroads, comprising four ninths of the total railway mileage of the\r\nworld, with our chain of the Great Lakes and our admirable system of\r\nnavigable rivers, it has been possible to exploit our natural resources\r\non a large scale, and to develop an inland traffic several times the\r\nvolume of our foreign commerce.\r\n\r\nOur international trade, however, although smaller than our domestic\r\ntraffic, has been large throughout the country, has grown rapidly,\r\nespecially since the year 1850, the period of the Civil War excepted,\r\nand is now increasing in such a manner as to give our foreign rivals\r\nmuch concern. The progress of our foreign trade during this century is\r\nshown by the following table containing the statistics of the value\r\nof our merchandise imports, exports, and total foreign trade for each\r\ndecade, beginning with 1790.\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING IMPORTS AND EXPORTS OF MERCHANDISE BY DECADES FROM 1790\r\nTO 1898.\r\n\r\n  ------+---------------+-------------+--------------\r\n  Year. |    Exports.   |   Imports.  | Total Trade.\r\n  ------+---------------+-------------+--------------\r\n  1790  |   $20,205,156 | $23,000,000 |   $43,205,156\r\n  1800  |    70,971,780 |  91,252,768 |   162,224,548\r\n  1810  |    66,757,970 |  85,400,000 |   152,157,970\r\n  1820  |    69,691,669 |  74,450,000 |   144,141,669\r\n  1830  |    71,670,735 |  62,720,956 |   134,391,691\r\n  1840  |   123,668,932 |  98,258,706 |   221,927,638\r\n  1850  |   144,375,726 | 173,509,526 |   317,885,252\r\n  1860  |   333,576,057 | 353,616,119 |   687,192,176\r\n  1870  |   392,771,768 | 435,958,408 |   828,730,176\r\n  1880  |   835,638,658 | 667,954,746 | 1,503,593,404\r\n  1890  |   857,828,864 | 789,310,409 | 1,647,139,093\r\n  1898  | 1,210,291,913 | 616,049,654 | 1,826,341,567\r\n  ------+---------------+-------------+--------------\r\n\r\nDuring the first half of the century, the expansion of our foreign\r\ntrade was not especially rapid. The Continental wars, lasting from 1793\r\nto 1815, and our own war with England, from 1812 to 1815, interfered\r\nconsiderably with international trade. Probably our tariffs of 1816,\r\n1824, and 1828 had the effect they were intended to accomplish, and\r\nrestricted somewhat the volume of our foreign commerce. The chief\r\nreason, however, why our trade progress was much more rapid after\r\n1850 was, that it was not until about that time that the means of\r\ninland transportation became developed sufficiently to make possible\r\na large domestic traffic. When our central West was able to exchange\r\ncommodities on a large scale with the seaboard, then our foreign\r\ncommerce began to increase rapidly.\r\n\r\nThe growth of our imports was very rapid for the period of fifteen\r\nyears, 1879 to 1893, their value having risen from $445,777,775\r\nto $866,400,922; but since then there has been a sharp decline to\r\n$616,049,654. Our exports, however, have increased in a phenomenal\r\nmanner during the past decade. Prior to 1897, the highest point was\r\nreached in 1892, when the value of the exports was $1,030,278,148. In\r\n1897, the value was $1,050,993,556, and in 1898 (the official year\r\nending June 30), the value, as shown by the foregoing table, was\r\n$1,210,291,913. In consequence of this great increase in our exports\r\nthe total foreign trade of the United States has not decreased in value\r\nduring recent years, although there has been a considerable fall in\r\nprices and a large falling off in our importations. Our total trade,\r\nduring the fiscal year 1898, was much larger than it was in 1890, and\r\nfell only $10,000,000 short of the value reached in the record-breaking\r\nyear of 1892. The calendar year 1898 shows a larger trade than has been\r\nshown by any previous year, the value being $1,868,523,057.\r\n\r\nThe leading industry of the United States being agriculture, our\r\nexports consist largely of various products of the farm. In 1898\r\nthe exported agricultural products were valued at $853,683,570, and\r\ncomprised 70.54 per cent of our total sales abroad. In spite of these\r\nlarge figures, the preponderance of agricultural over other products\r\nis being reduced with considerable rapidity by the growth in the\r\nexportation of manufactures. Before 1876 our exports of manufactures\r\nwere less than $100,000,000 a year; whereas, in the calendar year 1898,\r\nthey were $370,924,994. In 1880, agricultural exports comprised 83.25\r\nper cent of our exports, and manufactures 12.48 per cent; and in the\r\ncalendar year 1898, a year of exceptionally large foreign sales of food\r\nproducts, agriculture furnished only 69.06 per cent,—less than seven\r\ntenths of the exports, while manufacture supplied 24.96 per cent, or\r\none fourth of the total. The year 1898 is a notable one in the history\r\nof American manufactures, for it was then, for the first time, that we\r\nsold to foreigners more of our manufactures than we bought of theirs.\r\n\r\nA table showing the total foreign trade of the United States from\r\n1789 to 1898, the first eleven decades of our national existence,\r\nhas recently been prepared by the Bureau of Statistics in the United\r\nStates Treasury Department. It shows the total imports and exports of\r\nmerchandise and specie, and on which side of our trade account the\r\ngrand balance comes.\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING TOTAL TRADE OF THE UNITED STATES 1789–1898.\r\n\r\n  Merchandise\r\n          Exports                          $30,952,202,985\r\n          Imports                           29,979,961,487\r\n                                          ----------------\r\n              Excess of Exports                972,241,498\r\n                                          ================\r\n  Gold and Silver\r\n          Exports                            3,400,623,581\r\n          Imports                            1,940,150,320\r\n                                          ----------------\r\n              Excess of Exports              1,460,473,261\r\n                                          ================\r\n  Merchandise and Gold and Silver combined\r\n          Exports                           34,352,826,566\r\n          Imports                           31,920,111,807\r\n                                          ----------------\r\n              Excess of Exports              2,432,714,759\r\n                                          ================\r\n\r\nThe table shows that we have exported nearly thirty-one billion\r\ndollars worth of commodities,—about a billion dollars more than we\r\nhave purchased. It also shows that we have sent out of the country\r\n$1,460,473,261 more of the precious metals than we have received. Our\r\nexports of merchandise and gold and silver combined exceed our total\r\nimports by the large sum of $2,432,714,759. If the statistics of our\r\nimports and exports for each year since 1789 be consulted, it will be\r\nfound that during the eighty-seven years preceding 1876 there were but\r\nsixteen years when our exports of merchandise exceeded our imports. The\r\nbalance of trade was nearly always “unfavorable.” Since 1876, however,\r\nthe balance has nearly always been on the other side, there having been\r\nonly three years when our exports did not exceed our imports.\r\n\r\nIn return for something, we have given foreign countries nearly two and\r\na half billion dollars worth more of commodities and precious metals\r\nthan we have received in return. A part of this large sum, possibly\r\none fourth, has been paid to foreigners for freights on our imported\r\ncommodities, and we have also spent large sums in foreign travel. The\r\nchief reason why we have exported more than we have imported is, that\r\nwe have been borrowing foreign capital to use in constructing railroads\r\nand factories and in developing our farms and mines. Prior to 1876,\r\nwe received $1,084,339,912 more than we exported; we accumulated a\r\nlarge foreign debt. Since 1876, we have continued to borrow abroad;\r\nbut we have been able to liquidate a part of our former debts, and\r\nalso to exchange large amounts of commodities and precious metals for\r\ncapital; for, since 1876, our exports have exceeded our imports by\r\n$3,517,054,671. If our present large excess of exports over imports\r\ncontinues, we shall soon become a creditor nation with large sums\r\ninvested abroad.\r\n\r\nThe history of our foreign trade is highly gratifying to our national\r\npride; our achievements have been signal, well-nigh continuous, and\r\nhave been more marked during the latter decades of the century than\r\nat any previous time. The history of the American marine, however,\r\npresents a somewhat different picture.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. THE AMERICAN MARINE IN FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC COMMERCE.\r\n\r\nIn colonial days maritime industries held an important place. The\r\nlocation of the colonies adjacent to the ocean, their dependence upon\r\nthe mother country for manufactures and upon the West Indies for\r\ntropical products, their need of foreign markets for their timber,\r\nfish, tobacco, and food products, and their abundant supply of lumber\r\nfor shipbuilding, all tended to make them a seafaring people. This\r\nfondness for the sea was especially intense in New England, where the\r\nreturns of agriculture were relatively meagre. The long Revolutionary\r\nWar destroyed many ships and interfered seriously with ocean commerce,\r\nbut the struggle gave the colonists what was of more value than\r\nships,—a spirit of venture and hardihood. Hundreds of ships and\r\nthousands of seamen engaged in privateering, and when the war ended\r\nthe maritime instincts of the Americans were stronger than they had\r\nbeen when the declaration of political and commercial independence was\r\ndeclared in 1776.\r\n\r\nThe imbecility of the general government under the Articles of\r\nConfederation and the restrictions placed upon interstate traffic\r\nprevented any considerable maritime progress between the Peace of\r\nParis and the inauguration of a truly national government under the\r\nConstitution. But a stable government, sound credit, and uniform\r\nnational laws for the regulation of commerce gave the maritime\r\ninstincts of the Americans a chance to assert themselves, and the\r\ntonnage of our ships grew rapidly larger. Our tonnage registered for\r\nthe foreign trade was only 123,893 tons in 1789; by 1795 it had grown\r\nto 549,471 tons; in 1800 it amounted to 667,107 tons; during the next\r\nfive years it increased to 744,224 tons, and by 1810 it had reached\r\n981,019 tons. Such a growth as this in twenty years, from such small\r\nbeginnings, was truly remarkable.\r\n\r\nThe American ships soon crowded most foreign vessels out of our\r\ncommerce. In 1790 we carried only 40.5 per cent of our imports and\r\nexports; but by 1795 we had secured 90 per cent; and, with the\r\nexception of a short period during and immediately following the War of\r\n1812, it was not till fifty-two years later that as much as one fourth\r\nof our foreign trade was carried under foreign flags. Moreover, we not\r\nonly carried our own commerce, but we also entered largely into the\r\ncarrying trade of other countries. The great European war crippled the\r\ncommercial activities of European countries, and made it easier for our\r\nships to gain control of our own commerce and to secure employment as\r\ncarriers for foreign merchants. During the fifteen years from 1793, the\r\nyear of the outbreak of the European war, to 1808, when the blockade\r\nof European ports and the capture of American ships and seamen led us\r\nto attempt to prohibit our ships temporarily from engaging in foreign\r\ntrade, our merchant marine rose from a position of obscurity to a place\r\nof great prominence on the high seas.\r\n\r\nAs long as ocean commerce was carried in wooden vessels, the maritime\r\ninterests of the United States continued to prosper. The War of\r\n1812–15, the panic of 1819, and the competition of foreign vessels\r\nafter the restoration of peace in Europe, gave our marine a setback,\r\nso that it was not until 1847 that our tonnage in the foreign trade\r\nexceeded the figures for 1810; but during the period of fifteen years,\r\nfrom 1846 to 1861, our tonnage increased 150 per cent. When the Civil\r\nWar, which proved so disastrous to the shipping interests of the United\r\nStates, broke out in 1861, our tonnage registered in the foreign trade\r\nequaled 2,496,894 tons,—the highest point it has ever reached. The\r\nAmerican sailing clipper was for nearly half a century the mistress of\r\nthe seas. As J. R. Soley says: “It was in these ships that for nearly\r\nhalf a century not only the largest freights of the world were carried,\r\nbut the finest and most profitable as well. Merchants having valuable\r\ncargoes to export would wait for the sailing of a favorite clipper, and\r\nmerchants with goods to import would instruct their correspondents to\r\nwait in like manner.” As late as 1850 the higher grades of commodities\r\nwere almost always shipped in the stanch and speedy American clipper\r\nship.\r\n\r\nSince 1861 the American marine in the foreign trade has played a rôle\r\nof decreasing importance. Three causes account for this. About the\r\nmiddle of the century our commercial rivals began to substitute iron\r\nships for wooden; but we were not able to adopt the better material\r\nin the construction of our ships because of the high cost of iron in\r\nthis country at that time. Great Britain could build the iron ships\r\nmuch cheaper than we could, and she soon began to displace us in the\r\ncarrying trade of the other countries. And it was not long before she\r\nbegan also to carry a large share of our own foreign commerce.\r\n\r\nThe second cause for our maritime decline was the Civil War. In 1861\r\nour tonnage registered for the foreign trade was 2,500,000 tons; by\r\n1866 it had fallen to 1,387,756 tons, a loss of over a million tons.\r\nDuring the war period, nearly 800,000 tons of our shipping were sold\r\nabroad; 110,000 tons were captured by Confederate cruisers; and other\r\ncasualties occurred. Of course there were no ships built for our\r\nmerchant marine during the stormy years of the war.\r\n\r\nWhy, it may be asked, did we not restore our ships after the war and\r\nregain our former proud place on the high seas? For the simple, though\r\npossibly unsatisfying, reason that we did not find it profitable to do\r\nso. Capital is invested where the prospects for profit are best, and\r\nthe inducement to put money into American ships for the foreign trade\r\nwas not strong. It still cost more to build ships in our country than\r\nit did in Europe, and the expenses of operating them when constructed\r\nwere greater. Moreover, our rivals had gotten possession of the lion’s\r\nshare of the world’s carrying trade, and would not release any portion\r\nof their business without a keen struggle. At the same time the\r\nAmerican capitalist was offered many opportunities for the investment\r\nof his property in domestic enterprises. During the quarter of a\r\ncentury which followed the war, we devoted our energies and capital to\r\nbuilding our railroads, opening the West, exploiting our mineral and\r\nforest resources, and building the mills and factories whose products\r\nare now rapidly entering foreign markets in all parts of the world.\r\nAmerica’s economic activities were industrial rather than commercial.\r\n\r\nThe result of these general causes has been the decline of our shipping\r\nin the foreign trade from two and a half million tons in 1861 to less\r\nthan three quarters of a million tons in 1898; but it seems that the\r\nlow-water mark has been reached and that the tide is turning. The man\r\nwho writes the history of our merchant marine on the high seas during\r\nthe first half of the twentieth century will, in all probability,\r\nwrite a record of rapid progress. We have already made much headway\r\nin substituting steel for wooden ships; and America’s foremost iron\r\nmanufacturer, Mr. Andrew Carnegie, says that steel ships can now be\r\nbuilt as cheaply on our Atlantic coast as they can be built on the\r\nClyde. Furthermore, the opportunities for investment in domestic\r\nindustries are becoming fewer and less alluring, and there are good\r\nreasons for thinking American capitalists will be disposed from now on\r\nto put their ventures in ships to sail foreign seas.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of American capitalists, however, will depend very largely\r\non the maritime policy adopted by the United States. That policy should\r\nunquestionably be as liberal as the policy adopted by our rivals\r\nin commerce. Whatever differences of opinion may rightly exist as\r\nregards specific measures for the restoration of the American marine\r\nto the high seas, all parties should agree as touching the justice and\r\nnecessity of treating our maritime interests as generously as Great\r\nBritain deals with the owners of her mighty marine.\r\n\r\nOur domestic marine, being free from foreign competition, has had a\r\nprosperity as great as the adversity of our foreign marine. The present\r\ntonnage of domestic shipping is nearly 4,000,000 tons, our growth\r\nduring the period since the Civil War having been nearly a million\r\ntons. The traffic on our northern lakes now employs 3256 vessels, canal\r\nboats, and barges, with a total tonnage of 1,437,500 tons; and two\r\nthirds of this tonnage consists of steamships. In 1888 our lake tonnage\r\nwas only 874,102 tons; the growth during a decade having been nearly 80\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to remark that the increase or decrease in the\r\nefficiency of a marine during the last few decades is not measured\r\nby the growth or decline in the tonnage statistics. The modern\r\nsteamship, aided by the many commercial auxiliaries that facilitate\r\nit in receiving and discharging its cargo, is a much more efficient\r\ntransportation agent than was its smaller predecessor propelled by\r\nsails, and loaded and unloaded mainly by human labor. Our present\r\ndomestic marine of 4,000,000 tons is at least twice as effective as was\r\nthe domestic shipping of 3,000,000 by which we were served a generation\r\nago.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. AMERICAN SHIPBUILDING.\r\n\r\nOne great aid to the achievement of maritime greatness is a strong\r\nshipbuilding industry, and every nation with commercial aspirations\r\nendeavors to establish the business upon a sure foundation. For some\r\ncountries, as in the case of the United Kingdom, that is much easier\r\nthan for others; and that is one reason why Great Britain has so easily\r\nsucceeded in maintaining her place as mistress of the seas.\r\n\r\nThe business of building ships in the United States, to be used in\r\nforeign trade, has passed through a golden age of triumphs, followed\r\nby a period of decline and discouragement, and it is now entering\r\nupon an epoch of revival. The golden age came in the days of wooden\r\nvessels. It began in early colonial times and lasted until the middle\r\nof this century, when the world began to buy iron ships of the United\r\nKingdom. The magnitude of our shipbuilding industry at the middle of\r\nthe nineteenth century is indicated by the fact that during the decade\r\nbeginning with 1850 the tonnage built in our yards equaled 3,988,372\r\ntons, an annual average of nearly 400,000 tons. During the three years\r\n1854–56 we constructed over a million and a half tons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STEAMER CAMPANIA OF THE CUNARD LINE.]\r\n\r\nThe decline in American shipbuilding set in sharply after the Civil\r\nWar, and, in spite of the continued growth of our domestic marine, the\r\ntonnage constructed by American builders steadily declined until 1886,\r\nwhen only 95,453 tons were built. The causes of this decline have been\r\nstated in what has been said regarding the substitution of iron and\r\nsteel vessels for wooden. The period of decline seems now to be safely\r\npassed, for we are annually building over 200,000 tons on an average,\r\nand every indication points to rapid progress in the near future.\r\n\r\nWhat is more indicative of progress than the increase in the tonnage\r\nconstructed is the growth in the percentage of steamers and iron and\r\nsteel ships built, as compared with the wooden sailing ships turned\r\nout. During the decade 1872–81, we built 800,000 tons of steamers and\r\n224,000 tons of iron and steel ships; in the decade following, we\r\nconstructed 1,200,000 steam tons and 485,000 tons of iron and steel\r\nvessels; and from 1891 to 1898 our yards turned out 730,432 tons of\r\nsteamships and 543,850 tons of iron and steel vessels. As these figures\r\nindicate, the reconstruction of our merchant marine is progressing\r\nwith a fair degree of rapidity. At the present time one half our\r\ntonnage consists of steamers; but our percentage of iron and steel is\r\nstill small as compared with other countries. Over seven tenths of our\r\ntonnage consists of wooden ships, whereas our chief commercial rival\r\nhas practically no wooden vessels whatever. Only 7 per cent of the\r\nFrench marine consists of wooden ships, and in the case of Germany less\r\nthan 5 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe outlook for iron and steel shipbuilding is so promising that a\r\nrapid increase in iron and steel tonnage is certain to come. Largely\r\nthrough the influence of the reconstruction of our navy, numerous large\r\nplants for the construction of steel ships have been established at\r\nBath, Philadelphia, Wilmington, Baltimore, Newport News, San Francisco,\r\nand other seaports. Cities on the Mississippi River, and especially\r\nthose on the Great Lakes, are engaged in building ships of iron and\r\nsteel. There are several steel plants in the Lake ports, and in them we\r\nhave built the larger part of our steel tonnage. Our iron ships have\r\nbeen built chiefly in the seaboard yards. During the present year,\r\n1899, the American yards are busy constructing vessels both for the\r\nnavy and for our merchant fleet, and new yards are being established.\r\nHaving begun selling crude and structural iron and steel and various\r\nclasses of machinery in Europe, even in Great Britain, we shall ere\r\nlong be selling iron and steel ships. The excellence of our navy has\r\nbrought us orders for war ships, and the skill and invention of our\r\nshipbuilders will bring us foreign orders for merchantmen.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. CAUSES ACCOUNTING FOR THE CENTURY’S COMMERCIAL PROGRESS.\r\n\r\nThe commercial progress of the nineteenth century, the salient phases\r\nof which have been depicted in the foregoing pages, has been the result\r\nof three sets of causes, economic, political, and social.\r\n\r\nThe economic causes of most importance are the improvements in\r\ntransportation, the reorganization of industry on a large scale, the\r\naccumulation of capital, together with the growth of corporations and\r\ncredit institutions whereby the utility of capital has been enhanced,\r\nand the discovery of large stores of gold.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CRAMP’S SHIPYARD ON THE DELAWARE.]\r\n\r\nTransportation is the handmaid of trade. Whatever enables this handmaid\r\nto do her work cheaper and quicker enlarges the scope and volume of the\r\nworld’s commerce. When one considers that it cost nearly four times as\r\nmuch in 1875 to ship wheat from New York to Liverpool as it did twenty\r\nyears later, and fully three times as much from Chicago to Liverpool,\r\none can readily understand how transportation has removed hindrances to\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\nCheap and rapid transportation has made an extensive commerce possible,\r\nbut it has been the organization of industry on a large scale that has\r\ncreated the chief demand for commerce. Industry at the present time is,\r\nto a large extent, so organized as best to promote the territorial and\r\ninternational division of labor; and each large producer regards the\r\nwhole world as his market. The amount of commerce required increases\r\nwith the concentration and specialization of industry, and with every\r\nwidening of the producer’s market.\r\n\r\nIt has been the accumulation of capital and its increased availability\r\nfor purposes of production that have made possible the organization\r\nof industry on its present basis, and enabled men to construct the\r\nhighly developed transportation system by means of which commerce\r\nis accomplished. The material progress of the past century is\r\nunprecedented. Industry has created wealth as with the touch of a magic\r\nwand; and this rapidly growing wealth has been made available capital\r\nthrough the instrumentality of the corporation which, by means of\r\nstocks and bonds, has gathered into giant organizations the property of\r\nhundreds and even thousands of individuals. The industrial corporations\r\nhave been greatly assisted in their work of concentrating and applying\r\ncapital, by the banks and other institutions that have enlarged\r\ncredit and made a given amount of property capable of performing a\r\nmuch larger work. The expansion of industrial credits, furthermore,\r\nhas been greatly facilitated by the issue of government bonds in\r\nlarge amounts during the century. These state obligations constitute\r\nexcellent business securities, of which banks, other corporations,\r\nand individuals make extensive use. Such are some of the factors that\r\nhave promoted the accumulation of capital and increased the volume of\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\nMoney is not capital, but an adequate supply of a sound and stable\r\nmedium of exchange is essential to industrial and commercial progress.\r\nTwice in the history of the world the discovery of large supplies of\r\nthe precious metals has given a great impetus to industry and trade:\r\nonce, in the sixteenth century, when the Spanish galleys brought to\r\nEurope rich treasure from the silver mines of America; and again, in\r\nthe middle of the nineteenth century, when the rich finds of gold\r\nwere made in Australia and California. The very rapid increase in the\r\ncommerce of the United States and of the world at large, which began\r\nabout 1850, was in no small degree the result of the rising prices\r\nwhich followed the discoveries of gold. The closing decade of the\r\ncentury is witnessing a similar occurrence. For many years prices\r\ndeclined rapidly; the demands made upon the world’s gold supply were\r\nrapidly increased at a time when the annual output was declining. From\r\n1850 to 1870 the annual output of gold averaged over $130,000,000;\r\nit then declined so rapidly that it amounted to only a little over\r\n$100,000,000 a year, in 1885 and 1886. It was only $118,848,700 in\r\n1890; but the present annual production is nearly $300,000,000, and\r\nthe fall in prices has been cheeked for a while at least. The very\r\nrapid enlargement in commerce during the past two years must have been\r\nfacilitated by the recent increase in the annual production of gold.\r\n\r\nA second general cause accounting for the world’s progress in commerce\r\nis political—the commercial policy followed by the leading nations\r\nof the world. Up to the nineteenth century, practically every country\r\nstrove to promote its trade, navigation interests, and its power as\r\na nation by means of the mercantile system,—a system of strict and\r\ndetailed regulation of foreign trade by means of tariffs and navigation\r\nlaws. Each country strove to determine the nature of its international\r\ntrade, and endeavored to carry on its commerce in its own ships. In\r\nthe case of one country, at least, the mercantile system was eminently\r\nsuccessful. Great Britain entered the great Napoleonic wars with a\r\npowerful naval and merchant marine, and emerged from that struggle the\r\nunquestioned mistress of the ocean. Her industries also, as well as\r\nher ships, were stronger than those of other countries; and she soon\r\nconcluded that both her foreign trade and her shipping would profit by\r\ndoing away with the restrictions of the mercantile system, and adopting\r\nthe policy of entire commercial freedom. She made no mistake, for her\r\nindustries and commerce have wonderfully prospered.\r\n\r\nThe success of free trade and freedom of commerce in the United Kingdom\r\nhad much influence upon other countries, and, during the third quarter\r\nof the nineteenth century, several countries began to move cautiously\r\nin the direction that the United Kingdom had taken. They soon found,\r\nhowever, that for them free trade and shipping meant British trade\r\nand shipping, because of their inability to compete successfully with\r\ntheir powerful rival; and, during the last quarter of the century,\r\nthe dominant commercial and maritime policy outside of the British\r\nIsles has been one providing for the regulation of trade by tariffs,\r\nand for the promotion of the mercantile marine by postal payments and\r\nbounties. At the present time, the two most powerful commercial rivals\r\nof the United Kingdom are the United States and Germany; and their\r\ntrade policy is one of regulation instead of freedom. It would seem,\r\ntherefore, judging by results, that both the United Kingdom and her\r\ncompetitors have acted wisely, and that in both cases the means adopted\r\nwere such as conditions demanded.\r\n\r\nThe third cause of the world’s commercial progress during the past\r\ncentury has been colonial expansion. Germany, France, and other\r\ncountries, influenced by the great success of the United Kingdom,\r\nhave established colonies in different parts of the world, and\r\nassumed control over uncivilized peoples, until there are now 125\r\ncolonies, protectorates, and dependencies. These 125 regions comprise\r\ntwo fifths of the land surface of the globe, and contain one third\r\nof its population. These colonies and protectorates import annually\r\nover $1,500,000,000 worth of commodities, and of this large sum more\r\nthan forty per cent is bought from mother countries. The last nation\r\nto adopt the policy of colonial expansion is the United States, her\r\nprincipal colony, the Philippine Islands, having been made a part of\r\nher possessions because of our desire to secure a larger share of the\r\ntrade of the Orient.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. THE TWENTIETH CENTURY PROSPECT.\r\n\r\nThe world is entering upon the twentieth century with the nations of\r\nthe earth bound to each other by much closer relations than existed a\r\nhundred years ago, and chief among the forces that draw the countries\r\nof the world together is commerce. It is commerce, more than anything\r\nelse, that has brought about the existing organization of industry in\r\nwhich each nation is dependent upon every other.\r\n\r\nThe nations of the world are mutually dependent, but their interests\r\nare not identical. In the future, as they have done in the past,\r\nnations will compete with each other, each striving to secure\r\nfor itself a maximum of economic advantage; and this competition\r\nwill continue to take the form of commercial rivalry. The great\r\ninternational struggles of the present day are being carried on to\r\nsecure trade advantages; and at no time in the past have those contests\r\nbeen more earnest than they now are. The conflicts of the twentieth\r\ncentury will be commercial struggles, and they will be intense.\r\n\r\nIn the centuries when Phœnicia, Greece, Carthage, Rome, and Venice were\r\nsuccessively powerful, the Mediterranean was the theatre of commercial\r\nactivity and international rivalry. The navigators and explorers, whose\r\nexploits closed the mediæval period and inaugurated the modern era,\r\ncarried the world’s commerce from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic and\r\ntransferred the centres of national greatness from the southern to the\r\nwestern and northern nations of Europe. The great industrial countries\r\nof the present are those of Europe and America adjacent to the North\r\nAtlantic. These countries originate the larger part of the world’s\r\ncommerce; and the main streams of international trade are those which\r\nconnect these countries with each other and with those regions of the\r\nearth less highly developed industrially.\r\n\r\nThe Isthmus of Suez, just north of the Tropic of Cancer, and the\r\nIsthmus of Panama, a short distance south of that line, were the only\r\nbarriers which nature placed across an otherwise continuous water route\r\naround the earth in the northern hemisphere. These barriers diverted\r\nthe lines which the world’s largest volume of traffic tends to follow\r\nfar to the south around Africa and South America, or did so until\r\n1869, when Europe overcame the barrier of most consequence to her by\r\nthe construction of the Suez Canal. Since the opening of that waterway\r\nEurope has enjoyed advantages for international trade superior to those\r\nenjoyed by our country. Our regions most highly developed industrially\r\nare tributary to the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. To the east of us\r\nlies Europe, a region of great industrial advancement, demanding\r\nlittle more than our surplus food products and raw materials; to the\r\nsouth are the countries of the South Atlantic lying along the line of\r\nthe world’s secondary commercial routes; countries, moreover, whose\r\ntrade we can secure only in direct competition with Europe, which has\r\nalready forestalled us at many points. In pushing their trade westward\r\nthe industrial States of the United States—and they are found in\r\nthe eastern half of our country—find that the possibilities of a\r\ntraffic by land are restricted within narrow bounds by the heavy costs\r\nof a long haul over the elevated Cordilleran Mountain ranges, while\r\nshipments by water have to take the circuitous and expensive route\r\naround South America. Until an isthmian canal is constructed the\r\nUnited States will be handicapped in its competition with Europe for\r\nthe trade of all countries bordering the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nThe United States looks forward to the coming century, confident of\r\nsharing largely in the world’s commerce. With an enormous and rapidly\r\ngrowing foreign trade, and with her industries sending their wares into\r\nall quarters of the globe, the future of her trade is certain. Shall we\r\nalso become a great maritime nation? Shall we be as successful in the\r\nage of steel steamships as we were in the days when our clipper-ships,\r\n“those strong-winged gulls in timber, put swift girdles around the\r\nearth?” Unquestionably, yes! The commercial advantages which our rivals\r\nhave possessed for half a century have nearly all disappeared. Our\r\nmaritime instincts are not dead; and when we again turn our attention\r\nin earnest to the work of international navigation, we shall “win anew\r\nthe wide-reaching seas our sires loved and occupied so well.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDUCATION DURING THE CENTURY\r\n\r\nBY FRANKLIN S. EDMONDS, A.M.,\r\n\r\n_Asst. Prof. of Political Science, Central High School, Philadelphia_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe nineteenth century has been characterized by a deep and abiding\r\ninterest in popular education. One hundred years ago there were many\r\nclose observers who strongly opposed all attempts to provide schools\r\nfor the masses, lest they should be educated above their station in\r\nlife. This feeling was particularly strong in conservative countries\r\nlike England. It led the Duke of Wellington to remark to one who was\r\nexplaining to him the work of Joseph Lancaster, “Take care what you are\r\nabout; for unless you base all this on religion, you are only making\r\nso many clever devils.” So careful a critic as Alexis de Tocqueville,\r\nafter his visit to the United States in 1831, wrote to Jared Sparks:\r\n“Are the effects of education uniformly good? Does not a man who\r\nobtains an education above his social condition become an unquiet\r\ncitizen?” The first triumph of the nineteenth century was the conquest\r\nof this fear; and there is to-day a general belief that it is the duty\r\nof each community to provide a well-developed school system, that each\r\nchild may have an opportunity for making the best and highest use of\r\nhis powers and capabilities.\r\n\r\nPerhaps no single element has contributed more to this change in the\r\npopular attitude towards schools than the writings of the great group\r\nof thinkers who, with lofty ideals and keen acumen, have devoted\r\nthemselves to the study and discussion of educational questions.\r\nGermany has been foremost in its contributions to educational\r\nliterature. Foremost in time as in influence is John Henry Pestalozzi\r\n(1746–1827). Although endowed with an “unrivaled incapacity for\r\ngovernment,” Pestalozzi has yet become an inspiration to modern\r\npedagogy, because of his love for teaching and the tender sympathy of\r\nhis nature. After various educational experiments, he opened, in 1805,\r\na school at Yverdun, on the Lake of Neufchatel, which soon won for him\r\na European reputation, and became a centre of interest to educators\r\nfrom all Europe. The Emperor of Russia gave him a personal proof of his\r\nfavor, and Fichte, the great German philosopher, declared that he saw\r\nin Pestalozzi and his labors the dawning of a new era for humanity. In\r\nhis writings and in his teaching Pestalozzi emphasized the importance\r\nof the home in education; he asserted the truth that all instruction is\r\nbased on observation: “Neither books nor any product of human skill,\r\nbut life itself, yields the basis for all education;” and in a general\r\nway he aimed to develop the child through his own personal activity,\r\nrather than to furnish him with useful facts.\r\n\r\nThe most eminent of Pestalozzi’s disciples was Friedrich Froebel\r\n(1782–1852), the founder of the kindergarten. After a varied career as\r\na forester, student at Jena, etc., Froebel went to Yverdun in 1808,\r\nand for two years was a co-laborer with Pestalozzi. The impulse which\r\nhe here received never lost its force. It brought him to consider\r\nthe problems of elementary education, and finally led, in 1837,\r\nto his establishment of the first kindergarten at Blankenburg in\r\nThuringia. His idea may be well expressed in his own words,—“I can\r\nconvert children’s activities, energies, amusements, occupations,\r\nall that goes by the name of play, into instruments for my purpose,\r\nand therefore transform play into work. This work will be education\r\nin the true sense of the term.” His great theory was idealistic—he\r\nbelieved in the unity of the universe, in the essential harmony of\r\nthe world. It was the duty of the teacher to fit the child for his\r\nplace in human society. This could be best done if the child was taken\r\nat a very early age and prepared for life in an ordinary school. The\r\nkindergarten, or child-garden, is thus a school where a child learns\r\nsocial life, where his play is systematized and his activities are\r\ndirected. The average course of study takes hold of the child when\r\nhe is six years of age; the kindergarten usually fills in the two\r\npreceding years. As an educational institution, the kindergarten has\r\nmet with little public support in Europe, although in Paris there are\r\na number of “maternal schools,” which correspond closely to Froebel’s\r\nplan. In the United States, Miss Elizabeth Peabody became the first\r\napostle of the movement. The idea of caring for the children below the\r\nregular school-age won instant favor, and in a number of large cities\r\nkindergartens were opened under private auspices. As their success\r\nbecame clearer and more positive, they were taken under the control of\r\nthe public. In 1896–97, the report of the United States Commissioner\r\nof Education shows that there were 1077 kindergartens in the United\r\nStates connected with the public-school systems of cities having\r\nmore than 4000 population, with an enrollment of 81,916 pupils. The\r\nInternational Kindergarten Union, formed for the purpose of “gathering\r\nand disseminating knowledge of the kindergarten movement throughout the\r\nworld,” has aided greatly in stimulating an intelligent interest in\r\nFroebel’s ideals in America.\r\n\r\nNone of the great German philosophers has been honored with a more\r\nloyal cult than Johann Friedrich Herbart (1775–1841), who directed\r\ngeneral attention to the necessity of studying the principles\r\nof education. In his writings and lectures while professor at\r\nthe University of Göttingen, Herbart started an inquiry into the\r\ntheoretical basis of instruction. He found the final aim of all\r\neducation to centre in the formation of moral character, while the\r\nkeystone of instruction is interest. “The final aim of instruction is\r\nmorality. But the nearer aim which instruction in particular must see\r\nbefore itself in order to reach the final one, is many-sidedness of\r\ninterest.” Herbart’s influence in arousing and directing thought has\r\nbeen most felt in Germany, but in America his name has been taken by\r\none of the most active educational associations, “The National Herbart\r\nSociety.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PESTALOZZI.\r\n\r\n(The Perry Pictures. Copyright, 1898, by E. A. Perry, Malden, Mass.)]\r\n\r\nNext to Germany in its list of great educational thinkers must\r\ncome England. At the beginning of this century there were no\r\n“public schools” in England, in the American sense of the term.\r\nThe great preparatory schools,—Eton, Rugby, Harrow, Winchester,\r\netc.,—although called “public” by the English, were in reality endowed\r\nboarding-schools, where as a rule only the children of the rich could\r\nbe found. General education was cared for by the village schools under\r\nthe direction of the vicar of the parish, and usually presided over\r\nby elderly dames with varied degrees of attainments. At the end of\r\nthe eighteenth century, the work of Andrew Bell and Joseph Lancaster\r\nbegan to arouse some interest. Working independently, the one in India\r\nand the other in London, both developed the same method of providing\r\ngeneral instruction at a minimum of cost, by using the more advanced\r\npupils to instruct the beginners. “By the aid of monitors,” said\r\nLancaster, “one master can teach a thousand boys.” In 1798, Lancaster\r\nopened the first English school of this kind in Southwark, London,\r\nplacing this inscription over the door: “All that will may send their\r\nchildren and have them educated freely, and those that do not wish to\r\nhave education for nothing may pay for it, if they please.” In 1808,\r\nthe Royal Lancasterian Society was organized, to agitate for more\r\nschools; and although its name was changed, in 1814, to British and\r\nForeign School Society, its work has continued down to the present\r\ntime. In 1818, Lancaster came to America, and was at once placed in\r\ngeneral charge of the public schools of Philadelphia. He was made\r\nprincipal of a model school for training teachers, which is believed\r\nto have been the first attempt at a normal school in America. After\r\nextensive agitation in New York, in Canada, where in 1829 he received\r\nan appropriation from the legislature to enable him to start his\r\nmonitorial schools, and even in South America, Lancaster’s work was\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nProbably the greatest teacher of the century in England was Thomas\r\nArnold, whose character will long live in literature through the loving\r\nportraiture of his pupils. While contributing little of importance\r\nto the science of pedagogy, he was yet able to work a revolution in\r\nthe general conception of teacher and pupil, and their relations to\r\neach other. He insisted that his teachers must continue their studies\r\nafter they had secured positions, and so raised professional ideals.\r\n“The pupil,” said he, “must drink from the running fountain, and not\r\nfrom the stagnant pool.” His sympathy gave him rare power to mould the\r\ncharacter of boys. He trusted his boys and they became worthy of it.\r\n“It is a shame to tell Arnold a lie! He always believes one,”—was the\r\ncommon saying. As a consequence, there went out from Rugby School from\r\n1827 to 1842, the years of Arnold’s headmastership, a group of clean,\r\nhealthy, whole-souled boys, well fitted to become leaders in English\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nMany contributions have been made to the literature of pedagogy during\r\nthe century, but there is none that has attracted more attention or\r\nstimulated more earnest discussion than Herbert Spencer’s “Education.”\r\nIn the first chapter of his book, Spencer asks the question which\r\naroused the educational world,—“What knowledge is of most worth?” It\r\nat once directed inquiry into the very heart of educational theory. The\r\ncourse of study, the order in which subjects should be considered, the\r\ntime to be given to each,—all these problems were vitally concerned\r\nwith the answer to this question. Mr. Spencer’s solution won instant\r\nfavor: “How to live,” said he, “that is the essential question for\r\nus.... And this, being the great thing needful for us to learn, is,\r\nby consequence, the great thing which education has to teach. To\r\nprepare us for _complete_ living is the function which education has\r\nto discharge.” This point of view led to the accenting of useful\r\nand practical subjects. The human body should be studied,—this is\r\nnecessary to fulfill the first law of nature, self-preservation. The\r\nnatural sciences should be an essential part of education: this is\r\nnecessary for our acquaintance with the world in which we must live\r\nand work. History and social science should be studied: that each one\r\nmay become fully in touch with the society in which he forms a unit.\r\nNaturally, little time would be left for branches that were æsthetic or\r\ncultural, and so Spencer would have the student give but his surplus\r\ntime to these. But the important thing was that he should know himself,\r\nhis world, and his society, so that he would be fitted to do his work\r\nin the most complete way. His practical influence upon education\r\nis best seen in the great increase of appreciation for the natural\r\nsciences, which has led to the introduction of nature observation and\r\nstudy, even in the most elementary schools.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FROEBEL, FOUNDER OF KINDERGARTENS.\r\n\r\n(The Perry Pictures. Copyright, 1898, by E. A. Perry, Malden, Mass.)]\r\n\r\nIn America there have been important contributions to educational\r\ntheory during the century. There has been a perfect flood of\r\neducational books, pamphlets, and periodicals, whose merit is so great\r\nas to extort even reluctant admiration from foreign critics. While\r\nthere has been much unevenness in quality, yet Americans have no reason\r\nto feel ashamed of their contribution to pedagogical literature. The\r\nbest work has been done in the discussion of specific questions, rather\r\nthan in an elaboration of general ideals. Administration, with its\r\nmanifold problems, has appealed strongly to the American genius; and\r\nconsequently the greatest names of the century are those of men who\r\nhave devoted themselves to some practical work, the ideals and details\r\nof which they have thoroughly mastered, and so have left enduring\r\nmonuments of their lives’ work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DR. THOMAS ARNOLD, OF RUGBY, ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n(Courtesy of The School Journal, New York.)]\r\n\r\nThe great achievement of the century in the United States has been the\r\nestablishment of a system of free and public schools. Like most of the\r\nnation’s intellectual impulses, this spirit seems to have come from New\r\nEngland. There, the democratic ideals of the people led to an early\r\nappreciation of the necessity for universal education. There can be\r\nlittle doubt that it was from the Puritan settlements in Massachusetts\r\nthat the original impulse toward universal education came. Thus, in\r\n1647, the Colonial Assembly required that each town containing one\r\nhundred families should establish a grammar school to prepare youths\r\nfor the university. During colonial times more and more schools were\r\nsteadily established. But the movement, which was zealously supported\r\nin New England and encouraged in the Middle States, especially by\r\nthe Friends, met with opposition in the South, where education was\r\nconsidered a family duty, and not within the province of the State.\r\nWhatever, therefore, was accomplished in an educational line prior to\r\nthe Revolution depended upon the spirit of the individual colonies;\r\nconsequently, there was the widest possible divergence in the policies\r\nand methods of different localities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN OLD LOG SCHOOLHOUSE.]\r\n\r\nBut as soon as the Revolution had been accomplished, and independence\r\nhad become a fact, a renewed interest in general education was evident.\r\nIt is exceedingly interesting to watch the development of the point\r\nof view that free schools were a necessity for the existence of the\r\nrepublic, and hence must be established by the State. The early\r\nfathers of the nation were not slow to recognize this. In the words of\r\nFranklin, “A Bible and newspaper in every house, a good school in every\r\ndistrict—all studied and appreciated as they merit—are the principal\r\nsupport of virtue, morality, and civil liberty.” “In proportion\r\nas the structure of a government gives force to public opinion,”\r\nsaid Washington, “it is necessary that public opinion should be\r\nenlightened.” And Jefferson, with his broad philosophical appreciation\r\nof democracy, started the battle against the ideas of Governor\r\nBerkeley, of Virginia, when, in 1779, he introduced into the General\r\nAssembly of Virginia a bill providing for the establishment of schools\r\n“for the free training of all free children, male and female.”\r\n\r\nThe half century from 1790 to 1840 is the period of the battle for\r\nfree public schools. It was a hard fight, complicated in many States\r\nby local questions and conditions that rendered success almost\r\nhopeless. Some opposed from the old point of view that education was\r\nan individual matter,—each should get for himself just so much as\r\nwas possible. Others raised the objection of cost,—if taxation was\r\nproposed, was it right to take money from one group to educate the\r\nchildren of another? Religious disputes hindered progress,—many of\r\nthe denominations had founded sectarian schools, and were unwilling to\r\nsee them replaced by public schools, where no creed would be taught.\r\nEspecially, in some States, as in Pennsylvania, where Swede, German,\r\nScotch, Irish, and English lived side by side, did the race problem\r\nenter as a perplexing element. Should any language other than English\r\nbe taught? What respect should be given to the traditions and customs\r\nof each race-group? Moreover, when the conservatism began to yield to\r\nprogress, it compromised with great reluctance. At first, provision was\r\nmade whereby the children of the poor should have their school fees\r\npaid by the State. Then public schools were started exclusively for the\r\npoor, which were branded with the stigma of “pauper schools.” But these\r\ndifficulties only served to increase the ardor of the public-school\r\nadvocates, and at length their success was complete.\r\n\r\nSome episodes of the struggle deserve special mention. Horace Mann\r\n(1796–1859) has been called the St. Paul of education in America.\r\nIn 1837, the State Board of Education was created in Massachusetts,\r\nand Horace Mann was appointed its first secretary. For twelve years\r\nhe labored with unflagging energy to build up the public interest\r\nin education. By speech and by pen, he awakened in his State an\r\nappreciation of the value of the public school system that has never\r\nsince decayed. He established on an enduring basis the business side\r\nof education in the State, by systematizing the school funds. The\r\npersonal sacrifice was enormous. He addressed public meetings all\r\nover the country. When he found that no arrangements had been made at\r\nPittsfield to prepare the schoolhouse for his meeting, Horace Mann and\r\nGovernor Briggs themselves swept out the building and set it in order.\r\nOne of his first interests was the provision of good teachers. In\r\norder to spur the Assembly to its duty, he begged from his friends the\r\nsum of $10,000, which, with an equal sum appropriated from the state\r\ntreasury, was used in the establishment of the Massachusetts normal\r\nschools at Lexington and Barre (1839). Outside of his administrative\r\nwork, his fame must rest upon his stanch advocacy of the principle of\r\n“the obligation of a State, on the great principles of natural law and\r\nnatural equity, to maintain free schools for the universal education of\r\nits people.”\r\n\r\nIn Pennsylvania, the hero of the battle for free schools was Thaddeus\r\nStevens. In 1834, a law was passed by the legislature establishing a\r\nstate system, and abolishing the distinction between rich and poor\r\nwhich had been noticed in the old pauper schools. Two years later,\r\na determined effort was made by the combined forces of ignorance,\r\nprejudice, and caste, to repeal the act of 1834. Nothing but the\r\nstanchness of Governor Wolf and the power exerted by the eloquence of\r\nthe “Old Commoner” saved free schools for the Keystone State, and so\r\nestablished the system which to-day receives more direct aid from the\r\nstate treasury than in any other State of the Union.\r\n\r\nWest of the Alleghanies, the interest in popular education has always\r\nbeen deep and thorough. Settled in large measure by the steady sons of\r\nNew England, education found there a most fertile soil. Moreover, by\r\nthe wise foresight of Congress, provision was made for school funds\r\nin a most satisfactory way. The Ordinance of 1787, which organized\r\nthe territory north of the Ohio River, contained a provision that\r\none section of land in each township should be devoted to public\r\neducation. If this grant, which was originally suggested by Jefferson,\r\nhad been carefully watched, it would have been sufficient to endow\r\nthe public schools of many Western States. The national government\r\ngave to education in the first hundred years of its history nearly\r\neighty million acres of public lands, but these grants were not always\r\nconserved with sufficient care. In 1896–97 the total revenue of the\r\nschool systems in the United States was $188,641,243, of which less\r\nthan five per cent was from state school funds or rent of school\r\nlands, while over eighty-six per cent was derived from state and local\r\ntaxation.\r\n\r\nSome little conception of the immensity of the common-school system in\r\nthe United States may be obtained from the following statistics, taken\r\nfrom the Report of the Commissioner of Education for 1896–97.\r\n\r\nCOMMON-SCHOOL STATISTICS OF THE UNITED STATES (NOT INCLUDING PRIVATE\r\nSCHOOLS, COLLEGES, OR UNIVERSITIES).\r\n\r\n                                                 1870–71        1896–97\r\n        I.—General Statistics.

This makes for\r\nthe United States a grand total of 16,255,093 pupils and students\r\nof all grades in public and private schools. The growth during the\r\nlast generation has been most marked. The statistical table gives an\r\nopportunity for comparison with the year 1870–71,—the span of a\r\ngeneration,—and it has been estimated that within this period the\r\naverage total amount of schooling has increased from 2.91 years to 4.28\r\nyears. In other words, the amount of education which each one felt able\r\nto afford has increased almost one half. Such is the magnificent result\r\nwhich has grown out of the isolated village schools of our New England\r\nancestors, fostered by the democratic desire for intelligence found all\r\nover the country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCHOOLHOUSE, SLEEPY HOLLOW, N. Y.\r\n\r\n(Courtesy of The School Journal, New York.)]\r\n\r\nEqually great has been the change in the spirit of the school. In the\r\nearly days the schools were very crude. Population was scattered, and\r\nsince the children could not go as far to school as their elders did to\r\nchurch, the number of schoolhouses was very great. They were usually\r\nput up by the people of the neighborhood with little pretense at\r\nadornment. The average schoolhouse was located either at a fork in the\r\nroads or on an elevation, where it shared, with the church, the honor\r\nof conspicuousness. We give a picture of Old Sleepy Hollow Schoolhouse,\r\nmade famous by Washington Irving’s elaborate description of Ichabod\r\nCrane, its ruler in the colonial days. But a structure of this kind is\r\nluxurious compared with the hardships of more sparsely settled regions.\r\nFrom Wickersham’s “History of Education in Pennsylvania” the following\r\ndescription is culled: “The pioneer schoolhouse was built of logs,\r\nsixteen by twenty feet, seven feet to the ceiling, daubed with mud\r\ninside and out, a mud and stick chimney in the north end, and in the\r\nwest a log was left out, and the opening covered with oiled paper to\r\nadmit light; holes were bored in the logs and pins driven in, on which\r\nto nail a long board for a writing-table, and slabs with legs answered\r\nfor seats. The early schoolhouses were generally situated near the\r\nroadside or cross-roads, being without playground, shade-trees, or\r\napparatus.”\r\n\r\nHere the master kept his country school for a term of from six to\r\ntwelve weeks. In the winter time the pupils were almost frozen, and\r\nthere were other dangers which the hardy lad of those days had to\r\nencounter. Nevertheless, rude, uncomfortable, and inadequate as they\r\nwere, it was here that our forefathers obtained their scanty schooling.\r\nThe three R’s, Readin’, Ritin’, and ‘Rithmetic, formed the basis of\r\nthe course of study. Methods were very simple. Much of the early\r\ninstruction was religious in its trend, and the child was expected to\r\nuse books which would teach moral lessons. Church books, containing\r\ncreeds and hymns and catechisms, might be used in the school for\r\nstudy. Then there were the primers or books to teach the A B C. The\r\nfamous “New England Primer” was published in the latter part of the\r\nseventeenth century. Later editions contained rhyming couplets upon\r\neach letter of the alphabet, illustrated with such imagery as the art\r\nwould allow. A page from the “Child’s Guide,” published in London in\r\n1762, is shown on page 527. Its verses were easily memorized, and\r\nsometimes gave a basis for a spelling lesson. There were no graded\r\nreaders until this century.\r\n\r\nWriting in some neighborhoods was taught only to boys, on the general\r\nground that it was an unnecessary accomplishment for the sex which\r\nnever engaged in business. Ink was home-made from bruised nutgalls\r\nplaced in a bottle with water and rusty nails. The writing was done\r\nwith a quill pen, and one of the foremost duties of the old-fashioned\r\npedagogue was to make and mend pens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR OF SCHOOLROOM, SLEEPY HOLLOW, N. Y.\r\n\r\n(Courtesy of The School Journal, New York.)]\r\n\r\nThe master set the copies by writing a lesson which was to be imitated\r\nby the pupils. There was no set style, but usually the teacher wrote\r\na bold, legible hand which in time was acquired with a fair degree of\r\nsuccess. Arithmetic was taught without text-books. Sums were given\r\nout by the master and worked out on paper on the desk. Nothing but the\r\nmore rudimentary principles was taught, and the higher branches of\r\nalgebra and geometry were unknown in the public schools of this time.\r\nSpelling was one of the favorite studies. It gave free scope for the\r\nmemory, and provided an opportunity for one of those public exhibitions\r\nin which Americans have always delighted. “Spelling on the book,” says\r\nWickersham, “was taught by attempting to lead the pupil to give the\r\nnames of syllables and words by naming the letters of which they are\r\ncomposed. The first lesson consisted of combinations of a word with\r\none or more consonants, arranged so that a kind of rhyme aided the\r\npronunciation, as _ab_, _eb_, _ib_, etc.” ... “Spelling off the book”\r\nconsisted in naming the letters of words pronounced for that purpose.\r\nBut the chief enjoyment of spelling came from the old-fashioned\r\ncontests, or “spelling-bees.” Sometimes it was to discover the best\r\nspeller of the district; again, one district might be pitted against\r\nanother. The spellers would be arranged in two rows. The first word\r\nwould be given to the first speller on one side, the next to his rival,\r\nthe third to his comrade, and so on. If one missed a word, he at once\r\ntook his seat; presently the contest would narrow down to a few, until\r\nat last all would have missed save one, and he or she became the\r\nchampion speller.\r\n\r\nThe teachers of the time formed a group of varied attainments, and\r\noftentimes with little professional enthusiasm. Teaching has always\r\nsuffered from the fact that a great number of young men enter upon\r\nits practice, who use it merely as a stepping-stone to some other and\r\nmore attractive pursuit. The number of those who have taught a few\r\nterms, in order to save money for a college, law, or medical course\r\nis legion; and this fact has laid the profession open to the reproach\r\nthat only the unambitious and the unalert follow it permanently. In\r\nthe early days of our country’s history, this stigma was intensified\r\nby the number of “itinerant schoolmasters,” men who wandered from\r\nplace to place, teaching a term in one village and then moving to\r\nthe next,—“odd in dress, eccentric in manners, and oftentimes\r\nintemperate.” Their work was simple in its nature; they were to\r\nkeep order and to teach the rudiments. Their methods in the latter\r\nhave already been referred to; for the former, they relied, almost\r\nuniversally, upon the unsparing use of the rod.\r\n\r\nThe wisdom of the practice of flogging has only been questioned in\r\nthe latter part of this century. In the early days it was the one\r\nrecognized punishment, even for students whose maturity and attainments\r\nwould suggest an appeal to reason. With this mode of punishment was\r\nassociated a more or less ingenious series of devices, such as the\r\ndunce-block, the fools’ cap, etc., all calculated to bring the offender\r\ninto ridicule, but utterly destructive of that good feeling between\r\nteacher and pupil, upon which so much stress is laid to-day.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the century the old-fashioned school has either passed\r\naway or else has been modified materially. To-day it is to be found in\r\nonly sparsely settled districts, while in the cities and in the more\r\ncultured neighborhoods one finds carefully planned systems of education\r\nthat show the fruits of the study and direction of some of the keenest\r\nminds that our country has produced. While it is impossible in the\r\nspace of a single chapter to refer to _all_ the changes, yet some of\r\nthe most important will be considered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  A.\r\n\r\n  In _Adam’s_ Fall,\r\n  We sinned all.\r\n\r\n  B.\r\n\r\n  This _Book_ attend,\r\n  Thy Life to mend.\r\n\r\n  C.\r\n\r\n  The _Cat_ doth play,\r\n  And after slay.\r\n\r\n  D.\r\n\r\n  The _Dog_ doth bite\r\n  A Thief at Night.\r\n\r\n  E.\r\n\r\n  An _Eagle’s_ flight\r\n  Is out of sight.\r\n\r\n  F.\r\n\r\n  The Idle _Fool_,\r\n  Is whipt at School.\r\n\r\n  G.\r\n\r\n  As runs the _Glass_,\r\n  Man’s Life doth pass.\r\n\r\n  H.\r\n\r\n  My Book and _Heart_\r\n  Shall never part.\r\n\r\n  I.\r\n\r\n  _Jesus_ did dye,\r\n  For thee and I.\r\n\r\n  K.\r\n\r\n  _King Charles_ the Good,\r\n  No man of Blood.\r\n\r\n  L.\r\n\r\n  The _Lyon_ bold,\r\n  The _Lamb_ doth hold.\r\n\r\n  M.\r\n\r\n  The _Moon_ gives Light,\r\n  In time of Night.\r\n\r\n  N.\r\n\r\n  _Nightingales_ sing,\r\n  In time of Spring.\r\n\r\n  O.\r\n\r\n  The Royal _Oak_ our King did save,\r\n  From fatal stroke of Rebel Slave.\r\n\r\n  P.\r\n\r\n  _Peter_ denies\r\n  His Lord, and cries.\r\n\r\n  Q.\r\n\r\n  _Queen Esther_ came in Royal State,\r\n  To save the Jews from dismal fate.\r\n\r\n  R.\r\n\r\n  _Rachel_ doth mourn\r\n  For her first-born.\r\n\r\n  S.\r\n\r\n  _Samuel_ anoints\r\n  Whom God appoints.\r\n\r\n  T.\r\n\r\n  _Time_ cuts down all,\r\n  Both great and small.\r\n\r\n  U.\r\n\r\n  _Uriah’s_ beauteous Wife,\r\n  Made David seek his Life.\r\n\r\n  W.\r\n\r\n  _Whales_ in the Sea\r\n  God’s voice obey.\r\n\r\n  X.\r\n\r\n  _Xerxes_ the Great did die,\r\n  And so must you and I.\r\n\r\n  Y.\r\n\r\n  _Youth’s_ forward slips\r\n  Death soonest nips.\r\n\r\n  Z.\r\n\r\n  _Zaccheus_, he\r\n  Did climb the Tree,\r\n  His Lord to see.\r\n\r\nCHILD’S GUIDE.\r\n\r\n(_Courtesy of J. Harold Wickersham._)]\r\n\r\nForemost in real importance come the changes in the course of study—in\r\nthe list of subjects which the well-educated young man may be expected\r\nto have mastered. One hundred years ago the average child would have\r\ngone to the village school for the three “R’s” with, maybe, a little\r\ntraining in geography and parsing. If a college career was open to\r\nhim, he would then go to an academy, usually a private institution,\r\nfor his introduction to the classics, Latin and Greek, and to algebra.\r\nWhile instruction was given in other branches, yet these formed the\r\nbackbone of the course. The average age of admission to college was\r\nconsiderably less than it is at present. In the ordinary college there\r\nwas a required course of study, in which Latin, Greek, and higher\r\nmathematics played the most conspicuous part. The scientific studies\r\nwere counted less educative, and were usually rather poorly taught.\r\nLiterature, history, and philosophy were sometimes included in the\r\ncollege curriculum, and in many ways the course of study was modeled to\r\nsuit the preferences and abilities of the different teachers. Nowadays\r\nthis is all changed. In the United States a graded school system has\r\nbeen created, that is, a complete course of study has been worked\r\nout, whereby certain studies are specified as suited for each year of\r\nthe school life. This is not the same for all parts of the country,\r\nfor the American school system, unlike that in Germany and France, is\r\nnot national in its organization. The authority over the schools is\r\nvested in the individual States, and as a consequence each State shows\r\npeculiarities in course of study, in laws, and in methods that make\r\nthe whole seem chaotic. There is, however, more similarity than would\r\nappear at first sight, and while what is asserted in general may not be\r\ntrue of each particular locality, yet certain lines of development may\r\nbe clearly seen.\r\n\r\nThe schools of the country may be divided into three\r\ngroups,—elementary, secondary, and higher. The elementary schools\r\nare built in some places upon the kindergarten; they are ordinarily\r\nsupposed to occupy the first eight or nine years of the child’s\r\nschool-life, and are classified as primary and grammar schools. During\r\nthat period the pupil studies a great variety of branches,—language\r\nstudies, reading, writing, spelling, and grammar; arithmetic,\r\ngeography, United States history, civil government, nature study,\r\nphysiology and hygiene, physical culture, vocal music, drawing and\r\nmanual training in boys’ schools, or sewing and cooking in girls’\r\nschools. Several of these subjects have been introduced only within the\r\nlast few years. The tendency toward enriching the curriculum is quite\r\nmanifest to-day; it is based upon the fact that by far the larger part\r\nof the pupils never enter the higher schools, since their education is\r\nended with the elementary schools, therefore it is thought desirable to\r\nbring some of the higher subjects into the grammar school.\r\n\r\nWith the completion of this elementary course the pupil passes into the\r\nsecondary school. Earlier in the century this was ordinarily a private\r\nacademy, either conducted for profit or by a religious society. In\r\nexceptional cases these schools were public; but as the benefits of\r\nhigher education were recognized more completely, the popularity of\r\nthese schools increased enormously. Public high schools were opened,\r\nand success led to their rapid multiplication, until to-day they form\r\none of the most useful elements in our system, sending forth year by\r\nyear leaders of thought and moulders of opinion. Their course of study\r\nhas been the subject of much controversy. The old academy prepared\r\nfor the college; the new high school prepares for life; consequently\r\nthere ensued a breach between the high school and the college which\r\nonly now is being closed. The ordinary high-school course is four\r\nyears, and includes languages, Latin, French, German, and sometimes\r\nGreek and Spanish; mathematics, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and\r\nsometimes analytical geometry and even astronomy; history, literature,\r\nphysical geography, physics, chemistry, biology, geology, drawing, and\r\noccasionally political economy, ethics, and civics. It will be noticed\r\nthat subjects formerly taught only in the colleges have been brought\r\ninto the high-school curriculum. This again is due to the “enriching\r\nprocess,” and is illustrative of the fact that for so many of its\r\nstudents the high school is the crown of their education. The stress\r\nlaid upon nature study and the physical sciences, and the introduction\r\nof modern languages, are among the most significant changes of the\r\ncentury, as indicative of the desire to bring the schools in touch with\r\nthe conditions of practical life.\r\n\r\nFrom the high school or academy, the student passes to the college or\r\nuniversity. Within the last decade an attempt has been made to give a\r\ndefinite pedagogical content to each of these terms. A _college_ is an\r\ninstitution where the liberal arts are studied for purposes of general\r\nculture. A _university_, on the other hand, prepares a man for one\r\ndefinite line of work, either professional or technical. Both confer\r\ndegrees upon those who have successfully completed their courses, but\r\nthose of the university (Ph. D., A. M., M. D., etc.) are of a higher\r\ntype than those of the college (A. B., Ph. B.). There were twenty-four\r\ncolleges in the United States in 1800. The six oldest were: Harvard,\r\nestablished in 1687; William and Mary, 1693; Yale, 1701; Princeton,\r\n1746; University of Pennsylvania, 1749; Columbia, 1754.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 there were 472 colleges and universities in the United States,\r\nrepresenting most of the States and Territories in the Union. Many of\r\nthese are entirely public, being supported by State appropriations;\r\nsome receive State aid; others were originally founded by private\r\nendowment, but have become public in their management; some are\r\nentirely private in both endowment and control. Most are non-sectarian,\r\nbut many require worship in accordance with the services of some\r\ndenomination. In general, all recognize their lofty function in society\r\nand are anxious to discharge it properly. Originally aristocratic in\r\nmany ways,—prior to the Revolution some colleges classifying their\r\nstudents in the catalogue according to the social rank of their\r\nfamilies,—they have become among the most popular institutions in the\r\neducational world, largely because of the high worth of their graduates.\r\n\r\nUniversities, in the scientific sense of the term, did not exist prior\r\nto 1800, except in the few medical and law schools and theological\r\nseminaries. The American conception of the university has been very\r\nlargely moulded by the experience of Germany. The college does not\r\nexist as a degree-conferring institution in Germany, but its place is\r\ntaken very largely by the _Gymnasium_. The German system comprises\r\nthree grades of schools: 1. _Volkschulen_ (primary schools), where\r\nthe elementary instruction is given. 2. _Gymnasia_ and _Real-Schulen_\r\n(secondary schools), which provide a nine years’ course for the pupil,\r\nusually covering the period from ten to nineteen years. The aim of\r\nthe first is to prepare for the university, while the _Real-Schulen_\r\nfit their students for the ordinary business callings of life. 3.\r\nUniversities, in which the studies are arranged in four faculties;\r\ntheology, law, medicine, and philosophy. On account of the thoroughness\r\nof the German teaching, many American students have gone to Germany for\r\ntheir university course. A sincere effort has been made in America to\r\ndevelop universities according to the German concept, with its detailed\r\nstudy of particular topics based on a thorough general education. Johns\r\nHopkins University, Baltimore, opened in 1876, has done most along\r\nthese lines.\r\n\r\nDuring the century a determined and successful effort has been made\r\nto break down the old-fashioned college curriculum, with its absolute\r\nand unvarying requirements from every student. Harvard University,\r\nunder the leadership of its brilliant executives, Thomas Hill and\r\nespecially Charles W. Eliot, has led the way by providing a series\r\nof elective courses from which the student might select a sufficient\r\nnumber to make up his roster. This has given scope to the exercise of\r\na freedom of choice that has been most wholesome in its effects upon\r\nboth the scholar and university. It has led to the neglect of the poor\r\ncourses and to the encouragement of the good ones; and it has promoted\r\nindividuality in the different students to a marked degree. The success\r\nof the elective system, and the development of post-graduate courses in\r\nthe university, taken in connection with the very great interest in all\r\nthe phases of higher education, constitute the chief lines of advance\r\nduring the century.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, then, that the student of to-day has a tremendous\r\nadvantage over his fellow of one hundred years ago in the subjects\r\nwhich he may study. The courses have been enriched, instruction has\r\nbeen systematized, new subjects, more closely allied with popular\r\nneeds, have been developed. But a gain which transcends in importance\r\neven these alterations in the curriculum, is that which has come\r\nthrough the teacher.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the teacher of our forefathers was a man of doubtful\r\nattainments and uncertain character, and while there were golden\r\nexceptions to any general criticism, yet it is beyond question that as\r\na class the teachership was not well esteemed. As a rule, there was no\r\nstable salary,—the teachers “boarded around” at the homes of their\r\npupils or received payment in produce from the farmers. At the school\r\nhe was janitor as well as educator. Outside of New England, there was\r\nlittle intelligent supervision of his efforts, and, on the whole,\r\nvery little effective home coöperation. Within the century, however,\r\nthere has been a marked increase in the esteem in which the teacher is\r\nheld, and in the popular appreciation of his work. Moreover, to-day,\r\nthe teacher better deserves esteem and respect. While the profession\r\nstill contains a vast floating element who look forward to a future\r\nin other lines of work, yet on the whole its members possess a keen\r\ninterest in their work and a desire for professional improvement. A\r\nmost powerful means toward this end has been found in the various\r\nteachers’ organizations. The Institute, with its annual assembly of all\r\nteachers within a given district, who for two or three days discuss\r\nschool questions and listen to lectures upon educational topics, has\r\nbeen introduced throughout the whole country with great success. The\r\nteachers in the various States have organized State associations, and\r\nthere are innumerable voluntary organizations, whose meetings give\r\neach teacher an opportunity for that free contact with others of his\r\nown kind that is so helpful and so suggestive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DR. CHARLES WILLIAM ELIOT, PRESIDENT OF HARVARD\r\nUNIVERSITY.\r\n\r\n(Courtesy of The School Journal, New York.)]\r\n\r\nThe oldest educational association in America, maybe in the world,\r\nis the American Institute of Instruction, organized in 1830. During\r\nits nearly seventy years of life it has been a vast inspiration to\r\nthousands of teachers. It has drawn its support chiefly from the\r\nNew England States and recently from Canada, but its influence is\r\nwidespread. Annual meetings have been held regularly. Among its\r\nleading spirits, it has numbered such men as W. E. Sheldon, Francis\r\nWayland, Henry Barnard, etc. Out of the success of the various State\r\nassociations, and perhaps suggested by the necessity for more general\r\naction, grew the National Educational Association, founded in 1857,\r\nwith the objects “to elevate the character and advance the interest\r\nof the profession of teaching and to promote the cause of popular\r\neducation in the United States.” Its first president was Zalmon\r\nRichards, and his successors have been the foremost educators of the\r\ncountry, including James P. Wickersham, Emerson E. White, William T.\r\nHarris, Albert G. Lane, Nicholas Murray Butler, Charles R. Skinner,\r\netc. Its membership has grown from 80 in 1857 to 10,654 (1898), and\r\nit has been estimated that some of its conventions have brought\r\ntwenty-five thousand people in their train. In spirit it is thoroughly\r\nnational, meeting in every section of the country in turn, so helping\r\nto promote uniformity in school ideas. As the Association grew larger,\r\nand its work became more complicated, its organization became involved.\r\nTo-day it consists of seventeen departments, each of which devotes\r\nitself to one phase of education, usually reporting at the annual\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\nSince 1892 the National Educational Association (N. E. A., as it\r\nis popularly called) has appointed three committees to investigate\r\nspecial lines of work in separate departments of the school system.\r\nThe Committee of Ten, whose chairman, Charles W. Eliot, was the\r\ndistinguished President of Harvard University, submitted a most useful\r\nreport in 1893 on Secondary School Studies. In 1895 the Committee of\r\nFifteen, of which Superintendent Wm. H. Maxwell was chairman, then of\r\nBrooklyn but since chosen to be the first Superintendent of Schools of\r\n“Greater New York,” made a valuable report on elementary education,\r\nincluding reports of sub-committees on the Training of Teachers,\r\nCorrelation of Studies, and the Organization of City School Systems.\r\nIn 1897 came the report of the Committee of Twelve on Rural Schools,\r\nSuperintendent Henry Sabin, of Iowa, as chairman. These documents\r\nhave been epoch-making; they have accumulated a mass of trustworthy\r\ninformation; they have procured opinion upon a wide variety of topics,\r\nand their influence upon the general systematization of the school\r\nsystem has been enormous. Their additional value lies in the fact\r\nthat they have been prepared by teachers who thoroughly understood\r\nthe topics which were being considered, and they have furnished to\r\neducators generally that consensus of professional opinion which has\r\nbeen so badly needed in America.\r\n\r\nIn this work of gathering and disseminating information, a most potent\r\npart has been played by the national government. The limitations of\r\nthe Constitution left education as a State interest, to be worked\r\nout by each commonwealth as it should think best. There had always\r\nbeen a general desire among teachers for some national organization,\r\nand at last, after the Civil War, Congress established a department,\r\nand then later made a Bureau of Education in the Department of the\r\nInterior. In 1867 Hon. Henry Barnard was appointed the first United\r\nStates Commissioner of Education. A wiser choice could not have been\r\nmade. Dr. Barnard’s career in education covers a period from 1830, when\r\nhe was appointed Secretary of the Board of School Commissioners in\r\nConnecticut, down to the present. Beyond question, his greatest work\r\nhas been the organization of the National Bureau of Education, which\r\nto-day is a grand educational clearing-house, sending forth in its\r\nexcellent reports an account of ideas and work of each State to the\r\nothers. Its high efficiency has been due, in a large measure, to the\r\ncharacter of its commissioners: Henry Barnard, from 1867 to 1870; John\r\nEaton, 1870–1886; Nathaniel H. R. Dawson, 1886–1889; William T. Harris,\r\n1889 to date. The present incumbent has had the satisfaction of the\r\nknowledge that his position has been removed from the list of partisan\r\nappointments. By his tactful prudence and genuine scholarship, Dr.\r\nHarris has brought his office into touch with every good educational\r\nwork for a decade, and has made his name a synonym for genial wisdom\r\nthroughout the whole country.\r\n\r\nThe teacher has been aided in his work by his professional\r\nassociations. It is, moreover, true that to-day the teacher enters\r\nupon his work better equipped for his duties. The normal-school system\r\nhas spread over the whole country, and every year thousands of young\r\nmen and women are sent forth with a preparation that fifty years ago\r\nwas not even dreamed of. Since the teacher better deserves respect,\r\nhe has commanded it the more readily. Gradually the barbarisms of\r\nthe schoolroom have disappeared. As the sympathy with education\r\nincreased, the necessity for excessive flogging passed away. To-day\r\nthere is a wide variety in opinion as to the efficiency of this mode of\r\ndiscipline. In one State, New Jersey, corporal punishment in schools\r\nis forbidden by law; but in most of the others it is permitted in\r\nspecial cases, as a general part of the teacher’s power when _in loco\r\nparentis_. The teacher is now paid a regular salary, but unfortunately\r\nit is the lowest paid in any profession for which formal preparation\r\nis required. In 1896–97 the average monthly wages of teachers was, for\r\nmales, $44.62, and for females, $38.38. In comparison with the standard\r\nof life throughout the country, this is poor pay. Superintendent\r\nN. C. Schaeffer, of Pennsylvania, in a recent annual report, states\r\nthat “one superintendent found that there were teachers in his county\r\nteaching for four dollars less per year than it cost the county on\r\nan average to keep one pauper.” This is an exceptional case, but it\r\nillustrates the general truth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM T. HARRIS.\r\n\r\n(The Perry Pictures, Copyright, 1898, by E. A. Perry, Malden, Mass.)]\r\n\r\nOne consequence of this low pay has been to accent a tendency which\r\nis fast removing education from the list of those professions in\r\nwhich men will engage. From 1870–71 to 1896–97 the percentage of male\r\nteachers decreased from 41.0 to 32.6; especially is this true in the\r\nolder States. This is in striking contrast with one hundred years ago,\r\nwhen, except in infant schools, teachers were almost universally of\r\nthe male sex. A variety of causes may be given for this change. The\r\npreëminent fitness of women for guiding the child during certain ages\r\nis acknowledged. Again, the decline of the rod and the introduction of\r\na happy sympathy between teacher and pupil have helped the tendency.\r\n\r\nBut of all the forces which have contributed to this change, none\r\nhas been more potent than the great increase of opportunities for\r\nthe higher education of women. At the beginning of the century the\r\nUnited States was not behind European nations in its provision for the\r\neducation of young women. No one thought of making anything like the\r\nsame provision for both sexes. Women were refused admission to the\r\ncolleges, and were obliged to content themselves with an elementary\r\neducation or else meet the expense of private tutorage. Gradually, in\r\nprotest against this state of things, girls’ seminaries were opened\r\nand girls’ high schools were established in the large cities. The idea\r\nof a seminary, “which should be to young women what the college is to\r\nyoung men,” was first given definite shape by Mary Lyon, who collected\r\nfunds for that purpose, and in 1837, two hundred years after Harvard,\r\nMount Holyoke Female Seminary was opened. Its success was complete; it\r\noffered the regular English and classical course, and its graduates\r\nentered generally into the teaching profession. Presently, colleges for\r\nwomen were incorporated, of which to-day the best known are Vassar,\r\nWellesley, Smith, and Bryn Mawr. As the demand for the higher education\r\nof women increased, presently it was queried, why may not the two sexes\r\nbe trained in the same institution? Is there any real necessity for a\r\nduplication of plants with the consequent weakening of resources? The\r\nWest has advanced far beyond the East toward co-education. Oberlin\r\nCollege, founded in 1833, opened its doors to both sexes from the\r\nfirst, and most of the institutions that derive their spirit from the\r\nWest have followed the same plan. As a result, some of the city systems\r\nare trying co-education in their high schools and elementary grades,\r\nand thus far, while there are many opponents, the general verdict is\r\nfavorable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IDEAL SCHOOLHOUSE AND GROUNDS. (Courtesy of Agricultural\r\nDepartment, Cornell University.)]\r\n\r\nBut the women were not content with a general collegiate training or\r\na normal course that fitted only for teaching. Within recent years\r\nthey have entered into the other professions with a keen enthusiasm.\r\nThey are allowed, in a few institutions, to take theological courses\r\nfitting for the ministry. The first woman physician was graduated in\r\n1849 from the school at Geneva, N. Y.; since that time special medical\r\nschools for women have been opened and some colleges have decided to\r\nadmit women on the same terms as the other sex. In most law schools,\r\nwomen may be admitted, and in several States there are women practicing\r\nat the bar. While the influence of tradition has been strong, yet there\r\nis to-day no reason why an American woman should not receive as full an\r\neducation and as complete a training as her brother.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUGGESTION FOR PLANTING A SCHOOLGROUND.\r\n\r\n(Courtesy of Agricultural Department Cornell University.)]\r\n\r\nIn considering the changes in school-life, the improvement in buildings\r\nand equipment must not be overlooked. With the appreciation of the\r\nvalue of education, there has come an attention to the environment of\r\nthe pupil that manifests itself in the provision of text-books, in\r\nthe erection of larger and better ventilated buildings, and in the\r\nadornment of school grounds. School architecture, especially where\r\npopulations are dense, has become an important science, involving\r\nproblems of light, heat, ventilation, etc., together with questions\r\nof furniture, fire-proof construction and playgrounds. There was a\r\ntime when the most interest was aroused by the exterior, that the\r\nschool might be an adornment to its neighborhood. To-day the important\r\nproblems of arrangement receive the most attention, and deservedly\r\nso. We give two suggestive pictures of modern schoolhouses. Professor\r\nLiberty H. Bailey of Cornell University, in a pamphlet which has been\r\nextensively circulated, has advocated a judicious arrangement of\r\nshrubbery around a schoolhouse, as space permitted, with a view to the\r\nelimination of all bare and cheerless features from the landscape. This\r\nis especially adapted to country districts. As a comparison, the new\r\nCentral High School of Philadelphia is given as one of the best types\r\nof a complete city schoolhouse. It has been erected at a total cost of\r\nover one million dollars.\r\n\r\nThe furnishing of a school has undergone characteristic development.\r\nThe hard bench, upon which our forefathers sat, has in a large measure\r\ndisappeared, and in its place has come a variety of desks patterned\r\nwith chairs fitted to each curve of the back, etc. Blackboards came\r\ninto general use about the middle of the century. In certain studies,\r\nmaps, charts, models, etc., seem indispensable, and the modern\r\nschoolroom contains all these. Moreover, as soon as science teaching\r\nhad won a place in the curriculum, the cry went up for laboratories,\r\nthat a higher grade of work might be done with the more advanced pupil.\r\nIt is rather a singular fact that in many places the public high\r\nschool led in this demand, rather than the more conservative college.\r\nTo-day no high school would count itself able to do its work without\r\none or more laboratories where each pupil might work for himself. In\r\nthe new high school of Philadelphia there are physical, chemical, and\r\nbiological laboratories, as well as a completely equipped astronomical\r\nobservatory.\r\n\r\nText-books were just coming into use at the close of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. The “Child’s Guide” was being superseded by such works as Noah\r\nWebster’s Spelling Book, Grammar, and Reader (1792). Within a few years\r\ncame Lindley Murray’s “English Grammar,” the work of a Quaker merchant\r\nwho wrote his famous text-book primarily for a young ladies’ school\r\nin his immediate neighborhood. The instant success of these books\r\ndemonstrated what a need there was for such a class of literature.\r\nThe writing and publication of text-books has become one of the most\r\nflourishing industries of the country. On account of hard usage, a\r\ntext-book does not last more than a few years, and this gives continual\r\nopportunity for a new book more nearly up to date than its predecessor.\r\n\r\nWithin recent years, less stress has been laid on the text-book,\r\nand its influence is being minimized. In the elementary schools the\r\nteacher explains the lesson, and in the higher schools the professor\r\nlectures upon his subject. Consequently, the text-book is relatively\r\nless important. This does not mean that less reading is being done,\r\nbut it does mean that the reading covers a wider ground. Particularly\r\nis this true where libraries have been established. The public library\r\nsystem is a most valuable auxiliary to the school system, and is fast\r\nbecoming indispensable. This is one of the great advantages which city\r\npupils have over those whose home is in the country, and it will lead\r\nin the end to district libraries. In some States, as in New York, a\r\nsuccessful effort has been made to inaugurate a system of traveling\r\nlibraries, whereby a case of fifty or one hundred volumes, relating to\r\na particular topic, will be lent for a time to any circle of readers.\r\nMassachusetts has best developed a library system, since there are\r\nbut nine towns in the State that have not free libraries. The growth\r\nof the universities has led to the accumulation of great collections\r\nfor special research and study. In 1800 there were but eleven college\r\nlibraries in America worth mentioning; to-day there are almost five\r\nhundred, of which the largest, Harvard, contains a half million\r\nvolumes. Libraries are of use, not only for pupils, but also for adults\r\nas well. They have aided materially in solving the great question of\r\nadult education.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NEW HIGH SCHOOL, PHILADELPHIA.]\r\n\r\nIn the New England towns of the middle part of the century, the lyceum\r\nlecture was exceedingly popular. University extension has recently\r\ncome to the front as the latest form of the lyceum system. The idea of\r\nlectures to the people by university teachers came from England, where\r\nit was suggested just after an extension of the suffrage had attached\r\na new value to the education of adults. Societies for the extension of\r\nuniversity teaching have been formed in Oxford, Cambridge, and London.\r\nTheir methods are on the whole identical,—university men are sent to\r\ntown or village centres to give a course of lectures upon some general\r\ntopic; after each lecture a voluntary class is held where questions may\r\nbe asked and answered; at the conclusion of the course an examination\r\nbased upon the course and collateral reading is given to those who care\r\nto take it; and sometimes a certificate or testimonial may be given.\r\nThe method has been transplanted to America and generally adopted by\r\nthe universities, with greatest success, perhaps, in the Middle States,\r\nwhere the American Society for the Extension of University Teaching has\r\norganized the field. During the period 1890–99, 862 courses of lectures\r\nwere given under the auspices of the American Society to audiences\r\naggregating 952,068. Another movement of equal importance is that\r\ndone by the Chatauqua Literary and Scientific Circle, which prepares\r\nlists of books for home reading, with a view to encouraging system\r\nin one’s use of spare time. Perhaps the most interesting public work\r\nfor adults is being done in New York city, where a lecture department\r\nhas been organized by the Board of Education, by which free lectures\r\nare given in schoolhouses to the people. In 1898, 1866 lectures were\r\ngiven to 698,200 people, and the president of New York’s School Board\r\nhas declared that “these lectures have contributed more than any other\r\nagency to the distribution of general intelligence among the masses.”\r\nThese forces have supplemented very well the work that is being done\r\nby the public night schools, which are established in most large\r\ncities, with a view to providing elementary, and sometimes technical,\r\ninstruction to those adults who care for it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DR. WM. H. MAXWELL, SUPERINTENDENT “GREATER NEW YORK”\r\nSCHOOLS.\r\n\r\n(Courtesy of The School Journal, New York.)]\r\n\r\nNo educational question has aroused more interest in business circles\r\nthan the problem how to train best those who will devote themselves\r\nto a commercial life. This has become a live question recently to the\r\nAmerican people. With improved processes in manufacture, the power of\r\nproduction has grown far beyond the consumption of our own people.\r\nConsequently America is competing with the great industrial nations\r\nof Europe for a control of the markets of the world. As soon as this\r\ncompetition became evident, the need for a better trained class of\r\ncommercial leaders was felt. The example of Germany has had a great\r\ninfluence upon other countries. There is a general conviction that\r\nthe leading position among commercial nations which Germany has won\r\nfor itself is due in large measure to the technical education given\r\nto German artisans and the commercial education provided for business\r\nmen. For illustration, the German government has recently established\r\nin Berlin a school where young men, preparing for business careers in\r\nAsia, can learn Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, and Turkish. German youths\r\nhave been supplanting English young men, to an appreciable degree, in\r\nthe great commercial houses of London. As a consequence, there has been\r\na strong demand in America for the establishment of commercial high\r\nschools,—public institutions in which German, French, and Spanish will\r\nbe taught, together with economics, industrial history, commercial\r\ngeography, public finance, social science, etc. These institutions\r\ndiffer entirely from the business colleges, of which there were 342\r\nin the United States in 1897, in that they are broader in scope and\r\ncontent. The latter qualify a man to be a good clerk by teaching him\r\nstenography, typewriting, bookkeeping, etc., but the former aim to give\r\nhim a broad, liberal education, enabling him to have an intelligent\r\ncomprehension of all matters which interest him in active business.\r\nThis movement is too recent to have borne much fruit, but in many\r\nof the larger cities of America, as New York, Philadelphia, Boston,\r\nBrooklyn, and Cleveland, commercial courses have been established in\r\nconnection with the regular high-school course; and in some of the\r\nlarger universities, as Pennsylvania, Chicago, Columbia, schools in\r\neconomics and politics have been created,—all with a view to equipping\r\na young man for an active business career. In view of the present\r\ninterest in this movement, more may be expected in the near future.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOOKER T. WASHINGTON.]\r\n\r\nThe close of the Civil War brought the American people to a problem,\r\nvast in its importance and intricate in its solution. The negro race\r\nhad had no opportunity for education under the institution of slavery.\r\nBut with their freedom came the necessity for creating a system of\r\nschools which could be of special help to this new body of citizens.\r\nThe South has preferred generally that separate schools should be\r\nprovided for the two races. In the ante-bellum days, the wealthier\r\nfamilies usually sent their sons and daughters away from home to obtain\r\ntheir education under better auspices than their own neighborhood could\r\nafford. So when the war concluded, and there was but little sign of\r\npublic schools, a new system must be created, and at once. The first\r\nwork toward educating the negro was done by the national government,\r\nthrough the schools opened by the Freedman’s Aid Society. The different\r\nreligious bodies throughout the country took a hand in the good work,\r\nby establishing special missionary boards for work in the South.\r\nPrivate benevolence lent substantial assistance. George Peabody, the\r\nphilanthropist, and John F. Slater, both founded trusts which they\r\nrichly endowed to aid in the establishment of schools in the Southern\r\nsection. But the greatest work was done through the awakening of the\r\npeople to the value of education, leading to liberal appropriations and\r\nto a firm public support.\r\n\r\nWithin recent years, negro education has assumed a new and interesting\r\nphase. Booker T. Washington, principal of the Tuskegee Normal and\r\nIndustrial Institute, Alabama, is the leading educator of the\r\nAfro-Americans, and he has won his high place by the success which\r\nhas attended his efforts at industrial education. His school at\r\nTuskegee was started in 1881, and to-day contains over one thousand\r\nstudents. While fully appreciating the value of an academic education,\r\nMr. Washington has felt that the first necessity for his people was\r\nthe knowledge that would earn a livelihood. As a consequence, the\r\nindustrial side of education has been accented; twenty-six different\r\ntrades or industries are in operation at Tuskegee, and one is taught\r\nto each student of the Institute. As a consequence, its graduates have\r\ngone forth into active life, well equipped to become bread-winners and\r\nto fill a useful place in society.\r\n\r\nThe care of those who, from birth or by accident, do not possess\r\nall the powers of a normal person, has aroused much interest during\r\nthe century. The deaf-mutes, the blind, and the mentally deficient,\r\nhave each had institutions created, where they are taught as much of\r\nthe knowledge of the world as is possible. The instruction of the\r\ndeaf and dumb proceeds along two lines. The manual or sign method of\r\nconversation, based on gestures, was founded by Abbé de l’Epée in\r\n1760; while about the same time Samuel Heinicke, a German, introduced\r\nthe oral method, by which the eye of the mute is trained to perform\r\nthe part of the ear, by learning the meaning of spoken words through\r\nobservation of the changes in the position of the vocal organs. Special\r\ninstitutions for these classes abound in Europe and America, with\r\nthe difference that, in the former, they are generally private or\r\nmaintained by charity; whereas in the latter they are maintained by the\r\nState. Rev. T. H. Gallaudet and his son, Dr. Edward M. Gallaudet, have\r\nbeen the leaders in the instruction of deaf-mutes in the United States,\r\nand have achieved a high degree of success.\r\n\r\nThe teaching of the blind is of equal value to education. Two methods\r\nare generally followed; an alphabet of raised letters is employed in\r\nsome cases, or, and more generally in the United States, a system of\r\nraised dots or points, which do not resemble the letter in form, but\r\nare a kind of shorthand to the reader. In both methods, the sense of\r\ntouch takes the place of sight. In some cases, notably Laura Bridgman\r\nand Helen Keller, the success has been so complete as to excite\r\nuniversal wonder. Perhaps no institutions alleviate more human misery\r\nthan do the schools for the blind, by bringing world-ideas within the\r\nlimited horizon of this afflicted class.\r\n\r\nMuch also has been done for the training of idiots or those who are\r\nmentally deficient. In 1848, the Massachusetts School for Idiots and\r\nFeeble-Minded was opened, and other States followed with equally\r\ngenerous provision. Within recent years, special schools have been\r\nopened in connection with the school systems of large cities, so\r\nthat children who need individual care and watchfulness may receive\r\nmore attention than they could secure in the graded class-room. All\r\nthese tendencies are exceedingly hopeful, as indicative of society’s\r\nrecognition of her duty to those who cannot satisfactorily care for\r\nthemselves. Humanitarianism in education has been a powerful and\r\nconstant force during the whole of this century.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DR. E. BENJ. ANDREWS, SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS,\r\nCHICAGO, ILL.]\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten that other agencies beside those established\r\nby States have been contributing to education. The Sunday-school\r\nmovement is one of the great efforts of the century, to help in\r\ntraining children by a voluntary organization. In 1781, Robert Raikes\r\nemployed some teachers for the poor children of Gloucester, in order\r\nthat their Sundays might be spent quietly and with profit. Presently,\r\nas the number of Sunday-schools increased, men and women proffered\r\ntheir services gratuitously. The teaching followed two general lines,\r\nsecular (reading, writing, etc.) and religious. The former was of\r\nhelp, especially to children who were employed during the week. From\r\nEngland, the movement came to the West. The American Sunday-school\r\nUnion was organized in 1824, and has ever since continued to stimulate\r\nthe establishment of more schools of this kind. In 1896, there were\r\n132,697 Sunday-schools in the United States and 9097 in Canada, with\r\na total membership of 12,288,153 and 721,435 respectively, while it\r\nhas been computed that in the world the number of Sunday-schools was\r\n246,658, with an enrollment of 24,919,313.\r\n\r\nIn European states, they have been solving the same problems as\r\nin America. The importance of education once admitted, the next\r\nproblem is to secure the funds and develop the system.[5] Because of\r\nadministrative centralization, this has been far easier in Europe than\r\nin America. The Minister of Education in France or Germany orders,\r\nand his directions are carried out; the United States Commissioner\r\nadvises, and while his recommendations influence public opinion, yet\r\nthe latter method is by far the slower. As a consequence, the European\r\nschools are more systematized and better organized than our own. Their\r\ncourse of study differs widely in details from our own, and generally\r\nshows more influence on the part of the pedagogical expert. Technical\r\nand professional education has been developed to an exceedingly high\r\ndegree. England has had a peculiar problem to face, in determining\r\nthe relation between the church schools and the secular schools, and\r\nhas only solved it by maintaining both. Most European countries have\r\nadopted the principle of compulsory education for children within\r\na certain age limit, and the same principle has been accepted in\r\nthirty-two States in America. In general, it may be said that in the\r\nchanges in course of study, in equipment, in the teachership, etc.,\r\nEurope and America have been working along parallel lines. As a rule,\r\nthese changes have come more quickly in America, where traditions were\r\nas yet unformed; nevertheless, the progress in Europe has been constant\r\nand very great.\r\n\r\n    [5] The comparative interest in education is well illustrated\r\n        by the following extract from an address by Dr. Charles R.\r\n        Skinner, recently delivered before the N. E. A.\r\n\r\n    “The United States, to-day the youngest of all, is the only\r\n        great nation of the world which expends more for education\r\n        than for war. France spends annually $4 per capita on her\r\n        army and 70 cents per capita on education; England, $3.72\r\n        for her army and 62 cents for education; Prussia, $2.04\r\n        for her army and 50 cents for education; Italy, $1.52 for\r\n        her army and 36 cents for education; Austria, $1.36 for\r\n        her army and 62 cents for education; Russia, $2.04 for\r\n        her army and 3 cents for education; the United States, 39\r\n        cents for her army and $1.35 for education. England 6 to 1\r\n        for war! Russia, 17 to 1 for war! the United States 4 to\r\n        1 for education! The United States spends more per capita\r\n        annually for education than England, France, and Russia\r\n        combined.”\r\n\r\nCanada has a well-established and well-regulated system, in which\r\nthe principle of free and public education is recognized. The eight\r\nprovinces contain twenty-four colleges, and the schools have over one\r\nmillion pupils. Education is more or less compulsory in all of the\r\nprovinces, but the law is not very strictly enforced. In Ontario,\r\nQuebec, and the Northwest Territories there are separate schools for\r\nRoman Catholics; in the other provinces the schools are non-sectarian.\r\nThere is a high professional spirit among the teachers, so that the\r\nschools may be expected to keep fully abreast of the times.\r\n\r\nThe nineteenth century has been a century of continuous advance in\r\neducation. Its spirit has been healthy, its achievements are notable,\r\nits work has been great. It would be futile, however, to assert that\r\nall is yet accomplished. The problems in elementary education are so\r\nmany and so important that there have been times when solution seemed\r\nimpossible. Nevertheless, the system is now established and is assured\r\nof public support, and with an education within the reach of every\r\nchild, the security of free institutions is forever guaranteed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE ART PRESERVATIVE”\r\n\r\nBY THOMAS J.

THE PRINTING PRESS.\r\n\r\nWhen Benjamin Franklin edited the “Gazette,” in Philadelphia, a century\r\nand a half ago, he set up the type, worked off the paper on a wooden\r\nhand-press of primitive construction, made wooden types for use in his\r\noffice, and engraved the cuts with which to illustrate the articles.\r\nIn those days printing was an art which figured among the mysteries of\r\nscience, and was practiced by men of high social standing and advanced\r\neducation. The sixty years which passed between Franklin’s purchase\r\nof the “Gazette” and his death saw the discovery of many scientific\r\nwonders, but the art of printing moved so slowly as to leave it at\r\nthe close of the eighteenth century practically in the condition in\r\nwhich Franklin found it when he began his career as proprietor of his\r\nPhiladelphia printing establishment.\r\n\r\nAnd this condition of affairs applied to England as well as to the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nWith all the rare ability possessed by the printer philosopher, he was\r\nable to do but little for the advancement of the profession which was\r\ninstrumental in making for him an international reputation.\r\n\r\nIn all that pertains to the printing business there is nothing with\r\nwhich the name of Franklin is connected as inventor; yet he is referred\r\nto invariably as in the highest degree representative of the “art\r\npreservative of all arts.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EARLY PRINTING PRESS AS USED BY BENJAMIN FRANKLIN.]\r\n\r\nWere the distinguished scientist, statesman, diplomat, printer, and\r\nphilosopher to come forth from his grave in the cemetery of Christ\r\nChurch, at Fifth and Arch Streets, Philadelphia, and go into one of\r\nthe great printing houses of the country, how astounding to him would\r\nbe the revelation! No more the wooden types or the unsymmetrical metal\r\npieces; no more the wooden hand-press, the wood engravings, the ink\r\nballs, and the process of printing a few hundred sheets an hour. The\r\nterrific rapidity with which the newspapers are turned out to-day,\r\nprinted, cut, pasted, and folded; the fineness of the work done on\r\nbooks and magazines; the wonder of one press putting on different\r\ncolors at the same time; the setting of type by machines seemingly\r\npossessed of human intelligence; the rapidity and the simplicity of\r\nmaking stereotype plates; the dexterity of forming ordinary metal\r\ntypes into all kinds of forms; the millions of books,—secular and\r\nreligious,—papers, and general literary productions turned out daily,\r\nwould so puzzle the gigantic brain and cloud the understanding of the\r\nphilosopher as to cause him to exclaim: “Take me back, O spirit of\r\ndeath, and let me forever rest from this seething, surging, whirling\r\nsphere of inventive progression.”\r\n\r\nWhen the genius of invention was turned toward the printing art, it is\r\nworthy of note that the press which attracted the greatest attention\r\nwas the production of a Philadelphian who once had been an associate of\r\nBenjamin Franklin. It was known as the Columbian press, the invention\r\nof George Clymer, and was regarded as of sufficient consequence to meet\r\nthe approval of the printing fraternity of Great Britain as well as of\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\nIn the National Museum in Washington, D. C., is the hand press which\r\nBenjamin Franklin used to print his Philadelphia paper, the “Gazette.”\r\nIt had been built for him in London, where he had used it about five\r\nyears prior to its being brought to Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nWhat a curious-looking affair it is! Yet it was little less in the way\r\nof primitiveness compared with that used prior to 1817, when Clymer’s\r\nColumbian came into use. When these productions are contrasted with the\r\nmagnificent contrivances of to-day, from which can be thrown sixteen\r\nhundred papers per minute,—papers of ten, twelve, and fourteen pages,\r\nprinted on both sides, pasted and folded,—the comparison is like\r\nputting the steamboat of Fulton by the side of the monster ships which\r\ncross the Atlantic ocean from New York to Southampton in less than five\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nThe Columbian press was looked upon, when presented to the printers, as\r\nan advance worthy of note in the art. It is easy to imagine how much\r\nprominence was given Clymer’s invention when it was placed beside the\r\nold common press. To-day, this supposed-to-be great piece of mechanism\r\nwould not even be dignified by a place in the most un-modern backwoods\r\nprinting establishment. And yet from this were printed the literary\r\nproductions of Great Britain, as well as of the United States, in the\r\nearly part of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe Columbian mechanical advancement consisted of the use of rollers\r\nfor inking the type,—very much like the process now employed in inking\r\nthe type when a rough proof is desired,—thus dispensing with the\r\nballs, which were managed by boys; the use of screws under the bed of\r\nthe press to hold in position the form, into which had been securely\r\nadjusted the type; and the application of a long bar to obtain pressure\r\nsufficient to make the impression on the paper. The picture of this\r\npress shows the flat carriage upon which was placed the type, the\r\nplaten or pressing surface, the bar which forced the platen upon the\r\ntype, the spring which carried the platen back to position when the\r\nimpression had been taken, and the track upon which the carriage was\r\nmoved forward and backward,—primitive enough, and sufficiently simple\r\nin construction to show the limited capacity of the inventive genius of\r\nour great-grandfathers.\r\n\r\nIt was about 1829 when the Columbian gave way to the Washington press,\r\nand this was used for some time for fine book-work. The feature of it\r\nwas an automatic inking roller attachment.\r\n\r\nWhile the Washington press had the capacity for producing fine work, it\r\nwas deficient in the speed required for meeting the demand then growing\r\nfor books and newspapers. Then the printers turned to a cylinder press\r\nwhich had appeared in the last decade of the eighteenth century. The\r\nLondon “Times” had taken hold of it, and brought it to such a condition\r\nthat its speed was raised to something like a thousand impressions an\r\nhour. König, a native of Saxony, in 1815, produced a press for printing\r\nboth sides of the sheet. It resembled two single presses placed with\r\ntheir cylinders toward each other, the sheet being carried by tapes\r\nfrom the first to the second cylinder. Its capacity was 750 sheets,\r\nboth sides, an hour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE COLUMBIAN PRESS.]\r\n\r\nCambridge University about this time was furnished with a press in\r\nwhich the types were placed on the four sides of a prism, the paper\r\nbeing applied by another prism. It proved unsuccessful. In this\r\npress, however, were first introduced the inking rollers formed of\r\na combination of glue and molasses. Rollers are made of these two\r\nmaterials to this day.\r\n\r\nCowper, an Englishman, in 1815, introduced curved stereotyped plates\r\nand fixed them to a cylinder. Two place cylinders and two impression\r\ncylinders were soon afterward worked together on one press by Cowper,\r\nprinting both sides of the sheet at the rate of one thousand copies an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nThis seems to have been the period when inventive skill began to\r\nassert itself in the printing press. The educational advancement of\r\nthe people in this country and in Europe, with the lack of facility\r\nfor furnishing information of the campaigns of Napoleon Bonaparte, the\r\ndesire for facts regarding the events transpiring in England, France,\r\nand Germany, the meagreness of the details which had been furnished\r\nof the conflict between Great Britain and the United States in 1812,\r\nconvinced the publishers of newspapers in this country and abroad that\r\nthe laws of supply and demand were not equally balanced. The outcome\r\nof this was a press constructed to print both sides of the sheet from\r\ntype, and was soon followed by the introduction of four impression\r\ncylinders. These were applied to the reciprocating bed to carry the\r\ntype for one side of the sheet, the sheets being fed from four feeding\r\nboards, the impression cylinders alternately rising and falling, so\r\nthat two sheets were printed during the passage one way, the other two\r\non the return passage. A pair of inking rollers between the impression\r\ncylinders obtained ink from the reciprocating board.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WASHINGTON HAND PRESS.]\r\n\r\nThe capacity of this press was five thousand an hour, and this was\r\nregarded as a feat worthy of public mention, record of it being made in\r\nthe newspapers of that period in a way which shows the general interest\r\nin the work.\r\n\r\nThe first power-press used in the United States was made by Daniel\r\nTreadwell, of Boston, in 1822. Two of them were used by the Bible and\r\nTract societies.\r\n\r\nThe London “Times” had succeeded in applying steam to the movement of\r\nthe printing press as early as 1814—a cylinder press being brought\r\ninto requisition, to the use of which they had the exclusive right.\r\n\r\nFollowing the Treadwell press, about 1825, came the improvements of\r\nSamuel and Isaac Adams, and the general use of the press which is still\r\nworked in the book offices of this country and Great Britain. It was on\r\none of these Adams presses, in 1863, that was printed the book written\r\nby Dr. Elisha Kent Kane, describing his second expedition in search of\r\nSir John Franklin, the Arctic explorer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD WOODEN FRAME ADAMS BED AND PLATEN BOOK PRESS.]\r\n\r\nIt was found that the Adams press could be used for newspaper as well\r\nas exceedingly fine book-work, its construction admitting of the\r\nuse of plates or type, and its speed such as nearly came up to the\r\nrequirements of that period. In this press a feed board holds the\r\npaper, which is fed by hand to a second board or tympan, having points\r\nto make holes in the sheet to regulate the second side. The type rests\r\nupon a bed which is raised by straightening a toggle-joint against the\r\nupper plates.\r\n\r\nThe fountain for the ink is carried at one end of the press. The inking\r\nrollers pass twice over the form. The paper is caught by grippers,\r\ncarried in a frame called a frisket over the form (or type), receives\r\nthe impression, and is carried by tapes to a fly frame in the rear\r\nwhich delivers it to the sheet board.\r\n\r\nWith the two-, three-, and four-cylinder presses, the Adams press,\r\nsteam power and various improvements in the make of inks and rollers,\r\nthe first half of the nineteenth century was looked upon as having\r\nmade for the printing press extraordinarily rapid advancement. Great\r\nBritain held first place in the production of newspapers and books, the\r\nUnited States was a slow second, then came France, Germany, Russia,\r\nItaly, Spain, and Austria, in the order given. The greatest evidence of\r\nthis march of improvement was the enormous increase in the production\r\nof the Bible, and the bringing of the cost to a figure which then was\r\nlooked upon as placing it within the reach of all classes. Scientific\r\nand literary works were being put out in great numbers, newspapers\r\nwere being started in every town in this country and England, and the\r\neditions put out in such European centres of advancement as Paris,\r\nMadrid, Berlin, Brussels, London, Liverpool, Dublin, Glasgow, St.\r\nPetersburg, Vienna, and Rome reached proportions then supposed to\r\nbe enormous. The London “Times” at that period had a circulation of\r\nabout 30,000,—and this was the leader in journalism. In the United\r\nStates the leading newspapers did not issue daily editions greater\r\nthan 20,000, while a circulation of 10,000 daily was regarded as being\r\nentirely satisfactory to the business ideas of the average publisher.\r\n\r\nThe opening of the last half of the nineteenth century may be spoken\r\nof as a quiescent period. It was the calm in the affairs of the United\r\nStates which preceded the occurring of stormy events which put to\r\nthe full test the strength of the young republic, the attitude of\r\nthe nations of the old world toward us, and the power of the people\r\nsuccessfully to maintain a government “of the people, for the people,\r\nand by the people.”\r\n\r\nMillard Fillmore became the President of the United States in July\r\nof 1850, succeeding Zachary Taylor, who died. The Congress had taken\r\na stand on the disturbing question of slavery by the passage of the\r\nfugitive slave law, and had made the first step toward freedom for\r\nthe negroes by the abolition of the slave trade in the District of\r\nColumbia. It was in this year that New Mexico and Utah were admitted\r\nas Territories, the entire population of the United States being only\r\n23,191,876; ten years later the population reached 31,443,321. The\r\npeople were beginning to realize how important was the printing press\r\nin placing them in communication with the statesmen of the country.\r\nThey were looking to Webster, Calhoun, Clay, Meredith, Everett,\r\nScott, Crittenden, Collamer, Marcy,—then in the fullness of mental\r\nvigor,—and they were demanding information of their acts in the\r\ncabinet, their speeches in Congress, their views on state rights and\r\nslavery.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that the Hoe American Printing-press Company\r\nstartled the world by producing the ten-cylinder press, the speed of\r\nwhich was limited only by the ability of the feeders to supply the\r\nsheets. The first one of them to be used in the United States was that\r\nupon which the Philadelphia “Public Ledger” was printed. It at once\r\ncame into general use in Europe and America. Its speed was 20,000\r\ncopies an hour.\r\n\r\nIn this press—still in use in many cities—the form of type is placed\r\non the surface of a horizontal revolving cylinder of about four and a\r\nhalf feet in diameter. The form occupies a segment of only about one\r\nfourth of the surface of the cylinder, and the remainder is used as\r\nan ink-distributing surface. Around this main cylinder, and parallel\r\nwith it, are smaller impression-cylinders. The large cylinder being\r\nput in motion, the form of types is carried successively to all\r\nthe impression-cylinders, at each of which a sheet is introduced,\r\nand receives the impression of the type as the form passes. One\r\nperson supplies the sheets of paper to each cylinder. After being\r\nprinted they are carried out by tapes and laid upon heaps by means of\r\nself-acting flyers. The ink is contained in a fountain placed beneath\r\nthe main cylinder, and is conveyed by means of distributing rollers\r\nto the distributing surface on the main cylinder. The surface being\r\nlower, or less in diameter than the form of types, passes by the\r\nimpression-cylinder without touching. For each impression there are two\r\ninking rollers, which receive their supply of ink from the distributing\r\nsurface of the main cylinder; they rise and ink the form as it passes\r\nunder them, after which they again fall to the distributing surface.\r\nEach page of the paper is locked up on a detached segment of the larger\r\ncylinder, which constitutes its bed and chases, termed the “turtle.”\r\nThe column-rules run parallel with the shaft of the cylinder, and\r\nconsequently are straight, while head, advertising, and dash rules\r\nare in the form of segments of a circle. The column-rules are in\r\nthe form of a wedge, with the thin part directed toward the axis of\r\nthe cylinder, so as to bind the type securely. These wedge-shaped\r\ncolumn-rules are held down to the bed by tongues projecting at\r\nintervals along their length, which slide in rebated grooves cut\r\ncrosswise in the face of the bed. The spaces in the grooves between the\r\nrules are accurately fitted with sliding blocks of metal, even with the\r\nsurface of the bed, the ends of which blocks are cut away underneath to\r\nreceive a projection on the sides of the tongues of the column-rules.\r\nThe form of type is locked up in the bed by means of screws at the foot\r\nand sides, by which the type is held as securely as in the ordinary\r\nmanner upon a flat bed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOUBLE CYLINDER PRESS.]\r\n\r\nThis press was regarded as the highest degree of perfection, until\r\nWilliam A. Bullock, of Philadelphia, put out his web perfecting press.\r\nThis completely revolutionized the printing business so far as the\r\nnewspapers were concerned. It came into use in 1861,—just before the\r\nbreaking out of the war of the rebellion in the United States,—in time\r\nto meet the enormous demands made upon the printing press at home and\r\nabroad. It had been in operation but a short time when the newspaper\r\nowners of Great Britain took hold of it, and for several years no\r\nother press was used by the newspapers of large circulation.\r\n\r\nHow slow and toy-like it seems in comparison with the monsters of the\r\npresent day! And yet this machine met the demands of a period when it\r\nwas supposed the circulation of the daily press had reached an altitude\r\nnever to be surpassed. A newspaper like the New York “Herald,” which\r\nhad attained a daily circulation of about 75,000, was looked upon as\r\nachieving the highest degree of success. In this last year of the\r\nnineteenth century the “Journal” and “World” of New York send out at\r\nleast a million copies of their papers 365 days in the year.\r\n\r\nWilliam A. Bullock worked at his web printing press for six years\r\nbefore he had it in shape to pronounce it applicable to the\r\nrequirements. It was not long after it was in successful operation\r\nthat one of his limbs caught in the machinery of one of his presses,\r\nand death was the result. As the presses first were made, and indeed\r\nfor many years thereafter, the paper was cut in the press before being\r\nprinted, and it was a difficult matter properly to control these single\r\nsheets until they were delivered, while the presses were without any\r\nfolding attachment. But these old style Bullock presses did succeed in\r\nturning out 6000 eight-page papers an hour, printed on both sides.\r\n\r\nIn 1873 a great improvement was made in the Bullock presses, which\r\nallowed of the papers being printed on the endless roll before the\r\npaper was cut.\r\n\r\nWith the aid of other improvements subsequently made these presses\r\nattained to a capacity of 16,000 eight-page papers an hour. But an\r\nunexpected limit was found in the impossibility of delivering beyond\r\na certain rate from the fly. Then R. Hoe & Co. (about 1877) invented\r\na contrivance which obviated the difficulty. It consisted of an\r\naccumulating cylinder, on which six or eight sheets were laid one above\r\nthe other and then delivered from the fly at one motion. This increased\r\nthe capacity of their perfecting press to 18,000 an hour. A folding\r\nattachment was then added; next a pasting and cutting attachment.\r\nThus, in 1879 they were able to turn out a press which produced 30,000\r\nperfect eight-page papers an hour—printed, cut, pasted, and folded.\r\n\r\nThe next great achievement was put in operation in a New York\r\npressroom in 1885. That was the double supplement press, which in\r\nreality combines two presses in one. It was the first press to insert\r\nsupplement sheets automatically, and it was the first press to print\r\nfrom two rolls of paper, one roll being placed at right angles to the\r\nmain roll. As the name of the press implies, from the secondary roll\r\nthe supplements are printed at the same time that the main part of the\r\npaper is being printed from the other roll. And by means of what to the\r\nordinary man seems a miraculous contrivance, but which to the initiated\r\nin the mysteries of mechanics is no doubt very simple, the supplement\r\nis automatically inset and pasted into the main paper before reaching\r\nthe fly, and dropped out folded ready for the newsdealer.\r\n\r\nFrom this press has been evolved the superb printing machine which, in\r\nrecent years, has astonished the world. On it can be printed eight-,\r\nten-, or twelve-page papers at a running speed of 24,000 an hour, or\r\n400 a minute, and whether eight, ten, or twelve pages are printed they\r\nall come out with the supplements inset and the paper pasted and\r\nfolded. From this press was developed the next triumph, the quadruple\r\npress. Marvelous machines these quadruple presses are, and it seemed\r\nimpossible that any press could be built for many years to come that\r\nwould beat them.\r\n\r\nThe printing business stood amazed, awe-stricken at the sight of so\r\nmany papers being turned out each hour. And before the amazement had\r\nsubsided there came forth the machine which is destined to go down in\r\nhistory as one of the great achievements in mechanics of the nineteenth\r\ncentury,—the sextuple press, manufactured by Hoe & Co., which has\r\nbrought forth as many wonderful improvements as any mechanical concern\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is impossible to explain in language comprehensible to the\r\nman who is not an engineer how this monarch among printing presses does\r\nits work at a rate of speed which is well-nigh incredible and outstrips\r\nthe flight of imagination itself, yet it is possible to convey an idea\r\nof what the extent of the work is.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIRST PERFECTING PRESS.]\r\n\r\nThis machine will print, fold, paste, and deliver 90,000 of a four-page\r\npaper or six-page newspaper in one hour. It will require some figuring\r\nto convey an adequate idea of how fast that is, for, as a matter of\r\nfact, it is faster than a man can think, and that is why I say that the\r\nspeed of the machine outstrips the flight of imagination.\r\n\r\nNinety thousand copies an hour is equivalent to fifteen hundred copies\r\na minute, and fifteen hundred copies a minute means twenty-five copies\r\nper second!\r\n\r\nNow take out your watch, and while the second hand is passing from one\r\nsecond to another try to grasp the idea that in all that brief interval\r\nof time twenty-five six-page newspapers have been printed. You can’t do\r\nit. It is faster than you can think.\r\n\r\nAnd yet in that second those twenty-five papers are not only printed,\r\nbut the inside sheets are automatically pasted in, and the twenty-five\r\npapers are all cut and folded ready for delivery to the newsdealers.\r\nIs there anything more marvelous than that recorded in the “Arabian\r\nNights”? Who said that there are no miracles in this nineteenth\r\ncentury? Why, if old Gutenberg,—peace to his soul,—or Faust, or\r\nCaxton, or even our own Benjamin Franklin had seen anything of the\r\nsort, they would have sworn that it was either a miracle or the work\r\nof the supernatural, with the chances in favor of the latter.\r\n\r\nEach page of the average newspaper has six columns, and in each column\r\nthere is on an average 1800 words. Six multiplied by six and the\r\nproduct of that by twenty-five, and that again by 1800, you will find\r\nmakes 1,620,000, which is just about the number of words that this\r\npress prints in a second when it is turning out six-page papers at the\r\nrate of twenty-five a second. That is something that will stagger any\r\nman’s imagination if he tries to realize what it is.\r\n\r\nThis press will print, cut, paste, fold, count, and deliver 72,000\r\ncopies of an eight-page newspaper in one hour, which is equivalent to\r\n1200 a minute and 20 a second.\r\n\r\nIt will print, cut, paste, count, and deliver complete 48,000 copies of\r\na ten- or twelve-page newspaper in one hour, which is equivalent to 800\r\na minute and a fraction over 13 a second.\r\n\r\nIt will print, cut, paste, fold, count, and deliver complete 36,000\r\ncopies of a sixteen-page newspaper an hour, which is at the rate of 600\r\na minute, or 10 a second.\r\n\r\nIt will print, cut, paste, fold, count, and deliver complete 24,000\r\ncopies of a fourteen-, twenty-, or twenty-four-page newspaper an hour,\r\nwhich is at the rate of 400 a minute, or very nearly seven a second.\r\n\r\nThis is lightning work with a vengeance, and yet it is possible that\r\nthere may be some who read this who will live to call it slow. That\r\nwill probably be when they have found out all about how to put a\r\nharness on electricity. No one can predict when inventive genius will\r\nreach its limits in the printing press. Before this press was built,\r\nthe fastest presses in the world were Hoe’s quadruple presses, which\r\nwill turn out 48,000 four-, six-, or eight-page papers an hour, 24,000\r\nten-, twelve-, fourteen-, or sixteen-page papers an hour, and 12,000\r\ntwenty- or twenty-four page papers an hour, all cut, pasted, and folded.\r\n\r\nThe sextuple press has a well-nigh insatiable appetite for white paper.\r\nTo satisfy it it is fed from three rolls at the same time, one roll\r\nbeing attached at either end of the press, and the third suspended near\r\nthe centre. It is the only press which has ever been able to accomplish\r\nthat feat. Each roll is sixty-three inches wide. When doing its best\r\nthis press will consume 25-7/8 miles of 63-inch wide white paper in\r\none hour, and eject it at the two deliveries, each copy containing an\r\nepitome of the news of the world for the preceding twenty-four hours,\r\nand each copy cut, pasted, and folded ready for delivery. It is a sight\r\nworth seeing to see it done, and in its way it is just as impressive as\r\nNiagara.\r\n\r\nA man turns a lever, shafts and cylinders begin to revolve, the\r\nwhirring noise sets into a steady roar, you see three streams of white\r\npaper pouring into the machine from the three huge rolls, and you pass\r\naround to the other side and—it is literally snowing newspapers at\r\neach end of the two delivery outlets. So fast does one paper follow\r\nthe other that you catch only a momentary glitter from the deft steel\r\nfingers which seize the papers and cast them out.\r\n\r\nThe machine weighs about fifty-eight tons. It is massive and strong,\r\nwith the strength of a thousand giants. And yet, though its arms are of\r\nsteel and its motions are all as rapid as lightning, its touch is as\r\ntender as that of a woman when she caresses her babe. How else does the\r\nmachine avoid tearing the paper? Paper tears very readily, as you often\r\nascertain accidentally when turning over the pages. Truly wonderful it\r\nis, and mysterious to anybody but an expert, how this huge machine can\r\nmake newspapers at the rate of twenty-five a second without rending the\r\npaper all to shreds.\r\n\r\nIt has six plate cylinders, each cylinder carrying eight stereotype\r\nplates, and six impression-cylinders. These cylinders, when the press\r\nis working at full speed, make two hundred revolutions a minute.\r\nThe period of contact between the paper and the plate cylinders is\r\ntherefore inconceivably brief, and how in that fractional space of time\r\na perfect impression is made even to the reproduction of the finest,\r\nis one of those things which, to the man who is not “up” in mechanics,\r\nmust forever remain a mystery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FOUR ROLLER TWO-REVOLUTION PRESS.]\r\n\r\nA double folder forms part of the machine. A single folder would not\r\nbe equal to the task imposed on it. As it is, this double folder has\r\nto exercise such celerity to keep up with the streams of printed paper\r\nwhich descend upon it that its operations are too quick for the eye to\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nThe press has two delivery outlets. At each the papers are\r\nautomatically counted in piles of fifty. No matter how rapidly the\r\npapers come out, there is never a mistake in the count. It is as sure\r\nas fate. By an ingenious contrivance—if I should try to describe it\r\nmore definitely most people would be none the wiser—each fiftieth\r\npaper is shoved out an inch beyond the others which have been dropped\r\non to the receiving tapes, thus serving as a sort of tally mark.\r\n\r\nTruly it is a marvelous machine—this sextuple press. Nowhere you will\r\nfind a more perfect adaptation of means to ends, nowhere in any branch\r\nof industry a piece of mechanism which offers a finer example of what\r\nhuman skill and ingenuity is capable of. And it is free from that\r\nreproach which is sometimes brought against the greatest triumphs of\r\ninventive genius in other departments of human activity,—that they\r\nmake mere automatons out of human beings.\r\n\r\nThere was recently manufactured by the Hoe Company for a New York paper\r\nan addition to this wonderful piece of machinery designated an octuple\r\npress. Running at full speed it will print, paste, cut, fold, and count\r\n96,000 eight-page papers an hour. It is nearly 14 feet high, and 25\r\nfeet long. Ten men are required to operate it. The cylinders revolve\r\n200 times in every 60 seconds.\r\n\r\nThis monster is divided into two working parts. The printing is done\r\non the half of the machine to the right. The paper passes over the\r\ncylinders there, where it is printed from the stereotype plates, and\r\nthen runs through the other half of the machine on the left, where it\r\nis cut, inserted, pasted, delivered, and counted from four outlets\r\nfolding in half-page size.\r\n\r\nThis press shows four distinct double printing machines, each fed by\r\nits own roll of paper. The paper from each roll passes against two sets\r\nof stereotype plate cylinders—one for each side of the printed sheet.\r\nThe machine is so perfectly adjusted that by simply turning a screw and\r\nmoving a gear a few inches each of the four sets of cylinders can be\r\nthrown out of operation; that is to say one quarter, one half, three\r\nquarters, or the whole press can be operated at will.\r\n\r\nThe folder is harmonized for each adjustment of the printing cylinder.\r\nThe folding of the papers has been brought to the highest state of\r\nperfection. The sheets are folded, cut, and delivered by a rotary\r\nmotion at a speed that could never have been attained with the\r\nreciprocating arms, such as were used prior to the Hoe inventions.\r\n\r\nWhen a sixteen-page paper is being printed it comes in four-ply\r\nthickness, and then doubles and shoots eight thicknesses under the\r\nknife.\r\n\r\nWhen a twenty-four-page paper is being printed it passes over the\r\nlongitudinal folder in six-ply thickness and passes under the knife in\r\ntwelve thicknesses. All this is attained without the use of guiding\r\ntapes. In fact, the speed could not be attained with them.\r\n\r\nAs the papers are folded and delivered from the four outlets, with a\r\nspeed too great for the eye to follow, the machine itself counts them\r\nin total and in bundles, as is done on the sextuple press. This monster\r\noctuple machine has a perfected system of ink distribution with which\r\nno other presses are equipped. Under the system results are obtained\r\nby decreasing the size and increasing the number of ink-rollers around\r\neach cylinder of plates.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of the type cylinders is such as to make the press\r\none that can be handled with great ease and rapidity. Along the right\r\nhand of the machine, between the two rows of cylinders, is an open\r\npassageway. It is large enough for men to pass through either from the\r\nground or from the gallery near the latitudinal centre of the press.\r\n\r\nFrom this open passageway the pressmen are able to watch every movement\r\nof the machine’s interior working, and from it they are able to make\r\nquick changes on the plate cylinders. The change in position of only\r\ntwo ink-rollers is necessary to change a plate on any cylinder. This is\r\na matter of great importance to a paper which prints many editions, for\r\nit is necessary to change plates so often and to economize every minute\r\nof time in order to catch the fast mails which carry the paper to all\r\nquarters of the earth.\r\n\r\nOn the octuple presses each roll of paper is guarded against breakage.\r\nThere is a device in the shape of a short endless belt of rubber which\r\npasses over two pulleys and rests on top of the roll of paper. The\r\npaper is then pulled from the roll as gently as the thread is pulled\r\nfrom the spool of a sewing machine. The belt pushes the roll along\r\nat a speed equal to and sometimes a little greater than that of the\r\nstereotype cylinders. Hence, all tension is removed from the paper.\r\n\r\nFrom the stereotyper’s department, where they have been made in a\r\nfew minutes, come the plates of curved, bright metal. Passed to the\r\npressmen, they are locked on the cylinders as fast as they can be\r\nhandled. The rolls of paper have been placed in their proper positions.\r\n\r\nThis accomplished, the men step back from the machine, the brakeman\r\npulls the lever, and the giant press begins its work. Slowly its\r\ncylinders revolve at first, but as headway is gained the rumble that\r\naccompanied the start increases into a shrill shriek as the limit of\r\nspeed is reached.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LITHOGRAPHIC PRESS.]\r\n\r\nThe paper rushes from its continuous rolls, is printed, folded, cut,\r\nand thrown out from the four outlets at a speed that would be over\r\ntwice greater than that of any express train if it were confined to one\r\nroll. Every paper is just like every other one, perfect in every detail.\r\n\r\nWhen this has gone on for an hour, two hours, or however long it may\r\ntake to run off the editions, the monster press can be stopped in an\r\ninstant. With the simple touching of a lever all its movement will\r\ncease before the cylinders can revolve five times, and they had been\r\nrevolving two hundred times a minute before.\r\n\r\nThe two wonders just described are confined to newspaper work. This\r\nsame American firm has produced presses upon which are printed the fine\r\nspecimens of magazines where the work takes a striking resemblance to\r\nlithograph printing. They have a speed of 8000 an hour. From them come\r\nbooklets of 16, 20, or 24 pages. From the presses of 4000 an hour come\r\nbooks of 32, 40, and 48 pages. In construction they are complicated and\r\ngrand.\r\n\r\nThen come the presses upon which are printed different colors.\r\nThese are made in England and the United States, and are used with\r\nsatisfactory results on prominent publications in both countries. A\r\nrecent issue of the “British and Colonial Printer” directs attention\r\nto this advance in mechanism through the medium of the Hoe art rotary\r\nform feeder. It says:—\r\n\r\n“This machine carries the mind back naturally to pre-rotary days, when\r\nthe Hoe multi-feeder held the field as the newspaper machine, to the\r\ndays of the heavy, and as we consider in these advanced days, clumsy\r\nturtle. When the creative genius of Colonel Hoe evolved the rotary\r\npress, the multi-feeder was almost at once relegated to the lumber\r\nroom of obsolete mechanics. It is hardly conceivable that it entered\r\nthe mind of any practical man at this time that the principle of\r\nmulti-fed flat sheet printing would ever be adapted to the production\r\nof high art illustrated literature, at a speed equal, or nearly so,\r\nto the former Hoe news machine. It has, at all events in our country,\r\nlong been a settled opinion that such work could only be successfully\r\naccomplished upon a flat-bed machine, that the mere curvature of a\r\nplate must destroy the beauty of a fine process block for example, and\r\nthat any attempt to travel at a greater speed than 1200 to 1500 an hour\r\nmust be at the sacrifice of depth and sufficiency of rolling. Whether\r\nthis is really so readers will now be able to form their own opinion\r\nfrom the pages of the ‘Strand Magazine.’ Those pages abound in very\r\nvaried methods of engraving, woodcut and process, line and nature, and\r\nreproductions alike from photos and from wash and crayon drawings.\r\nEvery page has undergone the process of electrotyping, cast straight\r\nand curved subsequently, and therefore the conditions of printing at\r\nthe high speed of 4000 (or to be strictly accurate, four sheets of 16\r\npages each put through at the rate of 950 each, or 3800 per hour) are\r\nas severe as could be desired.\r\n\r\n“The British printer has yet to acquire a full mastery of its\r\ncapabilities, and the engineer has equally before him in some degree a\r\nperiod of development. Some of the portraiture, human and animal, is\r\nequal to anything seen. The make-ready (upon hard packing) exhibits\r\nthe highest quality, and the distribution of color perfection.\r\nThe plate-cylinder is made as large as the desired speed renders\r\npracticable, in order that the curvature of the plates may be reduced\r\nto a minimum. The provision for securing adequate distribution and\r\nin-rolling is upon a liberal scale, but not one whit more so than\r\nis requisite, extent of surface and speed of running considered.\r\nThere are 16 inkers and 38 distributors, with 16 iron distribution\r\ncylinders. The sheets are fed in two at either side of the machine,\r\nthose from the right hand feeders being delivered upon the table at\r\nthe extreme left, the other upon the inner delivery board. The plates\r\nare rigidly secured by special clutches. To facilitate the imposition\r\nof the plates, or any attention required by the cylinder, the short\r\nrear portion of the machine back of the cylinder is detachable and\r\ncan be run out upon an extended base, and then closed up and put into\r\ngear again. This renders it perfectly accessible at the most essential\r\npoint. The sheets are of course printed on one side only. We have not\r\nyet attained to the perfecting stage in art work in combination with\r\nhigh speed; the introduction of the Hoe art rotary press, however,\r\nmarks a distinct epoch in this class of printing in Great Britain.\r\nColor printing-presses are in use in the newspaper and magazine offices\r\nin this country, and from them are produced the artistic as well as the\r\nlurid styles of art.”\r\n\r\nWhat the possibilities of the printing press are, looking at the degree\r\nof excellence at present attained, it is difficult to predict. It\r\nwould seem as if the height of perfection now had been reached. The\r\nprobability is that the printer at the end of the first quarter of the\r\ntwentieth century may look with something akin to contempt upon the\r\nmachines which now are regarded with so much pride.\r\n\r\nSuch a thing is possible in this age of invention.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NUMBERING CARD PRESS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE SETTING OF TYPE.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the nineteenth century, when the little metal\r\npieces of type were picked up one at a time and placed in the composing\r\n“stick” by hand, there was attached to the work an importance which\r\nelevated it almost to the ranks of the trained professions. In England,\r\nas late as 1817, compositors arrogated to themselves the dignity of\r\ncarrying swords. At the close of the nineteenth century, the art is\r\nseen to be passing into the sphere of mechanics,—the methods in vogue\r\nmaking it entirely a mechanical operation. Before many years of the\r\ntwentieth century have passed, there will have been attained a degree\r\nof advancement which will dispense with the hand of man in guiding\r\nthe movements of the machine. The inventive skill which brought the\r\nprinting press to such a high point of excellence and speed has been\r\nturned toward the work of type-composing, and the forward march is\r\nlikely to be as rapid.\r\n\r\nOutside of the actual learned professions, no occupation has\r\ncontributed so many prominent figures to the history and progress of\r\nthis country as the composing-room. They have filled important places\r\nin journalism, politics, Congress, state legislatures, the army and\r\nnavy, and the world of literature.\r\n\r\nHorace Greeley, the founder of the New York “Tribune,”—writer,\r\nstatesman, and man of affairs,—is one of the notable figures of the\r\npresent century, who laid the foundation of his career at a case of\r\ntype.\r\n\r\nSchuyler Colfax, who became Vice-President of the United States in\r\n1869, passed the early years of his life setting type.\r\n\r\nAnd, strange to say, these two men, when the presidential chair seemed\r\na possible realization of their ambition, were opposed by men of their\r\ncraft simply because they had seemed to run so far above the “stick”\r\nand “rule.”\r\n\r\nSimon Cameron, of Pennsylvania, once Secretary of War, United States\r\nsenator, representative of the United States abroad, and for many years\r\npolitical master of his great State, was proud to say that he had begun\r\nhis career as a type-setter in a country printing-office. It is worth\r\nwhile noticing that this printer-politician’s life covered nearly\r\na century of existence. His life spanned every president from John\r\nAdams in 1799 to Benjamin Harrison in 1889, while his active political\r\ncontrol of Pennsylvania covered a period of sixty-five years,—a record\r\nmade by only one man within the history of the United States.\r\n\r\nEvery state in the Union has contributed to history its quota of\r\nprinter-statesmen, printer-authors, and printer-journalists. How many\r\nof such there have been in this nineteenth century would be beyond\r\nordinary research to ascertain. But printers—compositors—can refer\r\nwith just pride to the fact that in all the advanced walks of life are\r\nto be found men who have been members of the guild.\r\n\r\nThe setting of type by hand prevailed universally until as late\r\nas 1880. That may be put down as the period when there came into\r\nanything like general use the machines for type composition, although\r\nexperiments in that direction had been going on for sixty years.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1820, printers realized that machinery eventually must\r\nbe brought into play for composing type. But how to do it was the\r\nscientific as well as mechanical problem. It was argued that the\r\nmachine must be so constructed as to pick up the type, uniformly\r\ndistribute the space between the words, and “justify” the lines, that\r\nis, make them the exact width.\r\n\r\n“It is beyond the range of possibility,” suggested the printer.\r\n“Mechanism never can be applied to art. The great Benjamin Franklin\r\nwould have discovered the way to make such a thing possible, if it were\r\npossible—which is impossible.”\r\n\r\nAnd the scientific electric discovery made by Benjamin Franklin in the\r\neighteenth century is, at the close of the nineteenth, the motive-power\r\nused for driving the machines for type composition,—the seemingly\r\nimpossible has reached the stage of possibility.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OCTUPLE STEREOTYPE PERFECTING PRESS AND FOLDER.\r\n\r\n(Capacity, 96,000 impressions per hour.)]\r\n\r\nDr. William Church, of Connecticut, produced a machine looking to\r\nmachine type-composition in 1820. It did not come into use, although\r\nhe spent large sums of money on it, and devoted a vast amount of\r\nenergy toward having it taken up both in this country and in England.\r\nAt the Paris Exhibition in 1835 there were exhibited several machines\r\nof this sort, one of which—the patent of Christian Sörensen, of\r\nCopenhagen—was used upon a daily paper issued during the exhibition.\r\nIn 1871, at the International Exhibition in London, there was shown\r\na machine possessing peculiar features. It used a perforated ribbon,\r\nthrough the medium of which types were worked into position. The\r\nmachine was cumbersome, complicated, and expensive, and could not be\r\nbrought into anything like general usage. In 1875 M. Delcambre, of\r\nParis, after twenty years’ work produced a machine in New York. It\r\nhad the same objections as the others. While this machine could do as\r\nmuch as the labor of three men by hand, it required a man to operate,\r\nanother man to place the set type in lines, steam to keep it in motion,\r\nand a big cost to construct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LINOTYPE (TYPE-SETTING) MACHINE (FRONT VIEW).]\r\n\r\nUp to this period, all the experiments had shown the want of something\r\nwhich would obviate the presence of a man to make the lines of the\r\nproper length and with equal spacing between the words. All the\r\nmachines which were anything near available picked up and placed in\r\nposition separate types. At the Centennial Exhibition of 1876, in\r\nPhiladelphia, there were shown machines which used brass dies and cast\r\na line of type. These seemed to possess the element for successful\r\nuse, and the outcome was the production of the machine which is now in\r\nuse in all the big newspaper offices in this country—the “Mergenthaler\r\nLinotype.” Practically it has driven all the other machines out of use,\r\nbut how long it will hold sway is a question. Already men of genius are\r\nexperimenting with two objects in view,—increase of speed, decrease of\r\ncost,—and it is fair to presume that before the twentieth century has\r\ngone very far into history these two objects will have been attained.\r\n\r\nThe linotype, as here shown, has the appearance of a heavy and\r\ncumbersome piece of machinery. It actually is so only when there are\r\nseveral of them placed in line—then they give to a composing-room\r\nthe appearance of a machine shop. This machine, instead of producing\r\nsingle type of the ordinary character, casts type-metal bars or slugs,\r\neach complete in one piece, and having on the upper edge, properly\r\njustified, the type characters to print a line.\r\n\r\nThese slugs present the appearance of composed lines of type, and serve\r\nthe same purpose, and for this reason are called “linotypes.” The\r\nlinotypes are produced and assembled automatically in a galley, side\r\nby side, in proper order, so that they constitute a “form,” answering\r\nthe same purposes and used in the same manner as the ordinary “forms”\r\nconsisting of single types.\r\n\r\nAfter being used, the linotypes instead of being, like type forms,\r\ndistributed, are thrown into a metal pot of the machine to be recast\r\ninto new forms.\r\n\r\nThe machine contains, as its fundamental elements, several hundred\r\nbrass matrices. Each matrix consists of a flat plate having in one\r\nedge a female letter, or matrix proper, and in the upper end a series\r\nof teeth, which are used for distributing to their proper places in\r\nthe magazine matrices containing different letters. There are in\r\nthe machine a number of matrices of each letter, and also matrices\r\nrepresenting special characters, and spaces or quads of definite\r\nthickness for use in tabular and other work of a complicated nature.\r\n\r\nThe machine is so organized that on manipulating the finger-keys it\r\nwill select matrices in the order in which their characters are to\r\nappear in print, and assemble them side by side with wedge-shaped\r\nspaces at suitable points in the line.\r\n\r\nThis composed line forms a line matrix, or in other words a line of\r\nfemale type, adapted to produce a line of raised printing type on a\r\nslug, which may be forced into or against the matrix characters. After\r\nthe matrix line is composed it is automatically transferred to the face\r\nof the mold, into which molten metal is delivered to produce the slug\r\nor linotype, after which the matrices are distributed or returned to\r\nthe magazine to be again composed in new relations for succeeding lines.\r\n\r\nThese operations are performed by mechanism, as shown in the outline\r\nhere presented.\r\n\r\n_A_ is an inclined fixed magazine, containing channels in which the\r\nassorted matrices are stored, and through which they slide, entering\r\nat the top and escaping at the foot, one at a time. Each channel is\r\nprovided at the lower end with an escapement device, _B_, connected\r\nby a rod, _C_, with a finger character of the matrices in the\r\ncorresponding channel. There is a key for each character, and also\r\nkeys for quads stored in the magazine. The keys are actuated by the\r\noperator in the order in which their letters are to appear in print.\r\nAs a key is depressed, it operates the corresponding escapement, _B_,\r\nwhich allows a matrix to fall out of the magazine through one of the\r\nchannels, _E_, to the inclined traveling belt, _F_, which serves to\r\ncarry the matrices down in succession into the assembler stick, _G_,\r\nin which they are stored side by side. A box, _H_, contains a number\r\nof elongated spaces, _I_, and a discharging device connecting with\r\na finger-key bar, _J_, by which the spaces are permitted to fall\r\ninto the line of matrices at the proper points during composition.\r\nIt will be perceived that the operation of the various keys results\r\nin the selection of the matrices and spaces, and their collection in\r\nassembler, _G_, until it contains all the characters to be represented\r\nby one line of print. After the matrix line is thus composed it is\r\ntransferred, as indicated by the dotted lines, to the front of a mold\r\nor slot extending through a mold wheel, _K_, from front to rear. This\r\nmold is of the exact size and shape of the slug required. The matrix\r\nline is pressed tightly against, and closed in front of, the mold for\r\nthe time being, and the characters, or matrices proper, face the mold\r\ncell or space. While the line is in place in front of the mold, the\r\nwedge spaces are pushed up through the line, and in this manner exact\r\nand instantaneous “justification” is secured. Behind the mold there is\r\na melting pot, _M_, heated by a flame from a gas burner, and containing\r\na quantity of molten metal. The pot has a perforated mouth arranged to\r\nfit against and close the rear side of the mold, and contains a jump\r\nplunger, mechanically actuated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OUTLINE OF TYPE-SETTING MACHINE.]\r\n\r\nAfter the matrix line is in place, the plunger falls and forces metal\r\nthrough the pot mouth into the mold, against and into the characters of\r\nthe matrix line. The metal instantly solidifies in the mold, forming\r\nthe slug or linotype, having on its edge raised type characters formed\r\nby the matrices. The mold wheel next makes a partial revolution,\r\nturning the mold from the original horizontal to a vertical position\r\nin front of the ejector, which then advances from the rear through the\r\nmold, pushing the slug out of the latter into the receiving galley, at\r\nthe front.\r\n\r\nA vibrating arm advances the slugs laterally in the galley, and thus\r\nassembles them side by side in column or page-form ready for use. In\r\norder to insure absolute accuracy in the height and thickness of the\r\nslugs, knives are arranged to act upon them during their course to the\r\ngalley.\r\n\r\nAfter the matrices in the line have served their purpose in front of\r\nthe mold, they are returned to the magazine to be again discharged and\r\nused in the following manner. The line is lifted from the mold and\r\nshifted laterally until the teeth at the top engage the teeth of bar,\r\n_R_. This bar then rises as shown by dotted lines, lifting the matrices\r\nto the distributor at the top of the machine, but leaving the spaces,\r\n_I_, behind to be shifted laterally to the magazine or holder, _H_,\r\nfrom which they were discharged. Each matrix has distributor teeth\r\nin its top, arranged in a special order or number, according to the\r\ncharacter it contains. In other words, a matrix containing any given\r\ncharacter differs in the number or relation of its teeth from a matrix\r\ncontaining any other character. This difference is relied upon to\r\nsecure proper distribution. A distributor-bar, _T_, in a single piece,\r\nis fixed horizontally over the upper end of the magazine, and is formed\r\nwith longitudinal ribs or teeth, adapted to engage the teeth of the\r\nmatrices and hold the latter in suspension as they are carried along\r\nthe bar over the mouths or entrances of the channels.\r\n\r\nThe teeth of the bar are cut away to vary their number or arrangement\r\nat different points in its length, so that there is a special\r\narrangement over the mouth of each channel. The matrices are pushed\r\nupon the bar at the end, and made to slide slowly along it while\r\nsuspended therefrom. Each matrix remains in engagement, and travels\r\nover the mouth of the channels, until it arrives at the required point,\r\nwhere, for the first time, its teeth bear such relation to those of the\r\nbar that it is permitted to disengage and fall into its channel.\r\n\r\nThe travel of the matrices is secured by longitudinal screws, which\r\nlie below the bar in position to engage the edges of the matrices. The\r\nmatrices pursue a circulatory course through the machine, starting\r\nfrom the bottom of the magazine and passing thence to the line being\r\ncomposed, thence to the mold, and finally back to the top of the\r\nmagazine. This circulation permits the operations of composing one\r\nline, casting a second, and distributing a third, to be carried on\r\nconcurrently, and enables the machine to run at a speed exceeding that\r\nat which any operator can finger the keys.\r\n\r\nOne half horse power is generally used in driving a machine. About\r\nfive square feet is the space occupied by the machine; it weighs 1925\r\npounds, and consumes about fifteen feet of illuminating gas each hour\r\nto heat the metal pot. Each machine will do complete work equal to that\r\nof five men by hand. The simplicity of the machine bears a striking\r\nresemblance to the typewriter, and this is operated successfully by\r\nyoung girls. When the matter set by the machine is placed together, the\r\npage presents a surface equal to an entire new set of type, or, as the\r\nprinters say, “We take on an entire new dress every day.”\r\n\r\nThat is a production of the nineteenth century. How commonplace it will\r\nappear when the achievements of the twentieth century are placed on\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. EVENTS AS THEY OCCUR.\r\n\r\nWhen the nineteenth century opened, great events were occurring in\r\nthe world. Napoleon Bonaparte was the central figure in the eye of\r\nEurope. He had, but a few years previously (1797), gone through the\r\nmost brilliant campaign known. He had crossed the Alps, defeated the\r\nAustrians at Montenotte and Millesimo, defeated the Sardinians at Ceva\r\nand Mondovi, and conquered Lombardy,—all in a few weeks. The year\r\nfollowing he had conquered Egypt, and in 1800 had become the first\r\nconsul and the ruler of France, to be declared Emperor four years later.\r\n\r\nThen followed, in rapid succession, the events which caused the world\r\nto look upon Napoleon as the probable coming ruler of the universe. It\r\nwas in 1805 that he began the war of aggrandizement. He crossed the\r\nRhine, compelling the Austrian army to surrender at Ulm; he entered\r\nVienna and routed the Russian and Austrian armies at Austerlitz.\r\nThis was followed by his move to make himself master of Southern and\r\nCentral Europe. He established his brother Joseph as King of Naples;\r\nhis brother Louis as King of Holland; his stepson Eugene as Viceroy of\r\nItaly; and his brother-in-law, Joachim Murat, as Grand Duke of Berg.\r\nThe following year he defeated the Prussians and entered Berlin.\r\n\r\nIt was not until his abdication at Fontainebleau, in 1814, that Europe\r\nand America breathed freely. His final overthrow at Waterloo in 1815\r\nremoved him from the stage as an active participant in the world’s\r\nhistory of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, the close of the eighteenth century was marked by\r\nthe death of Washington, while 1800, 1801, 1802 saw us make a treaty\r\nof peace with France, remove the national capital from Philadelphia to\r\nWashington, D. C., declare war against Tripoli, purchase Louisiana from\r\nFrance, and enter upon the disputes with Great Britain which culminated\r\nin a declaration of war with the mother country, in June of 1812.\r\n\r\nWhile these events at home and abroad were making history, long periods\r\nof time elapsed between their occurrence and their being given to the\r\npeople. There was no telegraphic communication which flashed messages\r\naround the globe. It was a wait until the mails brought the news. Two\r\nmonths, probably, elapsed after the battle of Waterloo ere this country\r\nwas furnished with the story which meant so much to the peace of Europe.\r\n\r\nWhat a change in this respect was wrought between the downfall of\r\nNapoleon Bonaparte in 1815 and the downfall of his nephew, Louis\r\nNapoleon, in 1870! On the fateful second of September, 1870, when the\r\nEmperor of France, Napoleon III., surrendered to the Emperor William\r\nof Prussia, on the field of Sedan, the news was flashed to America in\r\nless than two hours. On that hot, sultry day eager crowds surrounded\r\nthe bulletin boards of the newspapers, on which were displayed the\r\nfacts connected with the overthrow of the Napoleonic dynasty. The\r\ndifference in time made it possible for us here to know all that had\r\nbeen done by the two emperors and by Bismarck an hour ahead of their\r\nactual happening. For days before that the crowds had surged around\r\nthe newspaper offices, for days afterward they did the same, and facts\r\nwere given with a rapidity which showed how wonderful had been the\r\nscientific stride between 1815 and 1870.\r\n\r\nHad any one in 1815 predicted the possibility of such scenes, he\r\nwould have been put down as a fit subject for a writ of _de lunatico\r\ninquirendo_. Such, too, would have been the comment on the one who then\r\nwould have suggested the likelihood of a newspaper in this country\r\nreaching a circulation of a million copies daily,—and yet such has\r\nbecome an accomplished fact.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the first quarter of the nineteenth century there had\r\nbeen no practical advance in the rapid transmission of news. This\r\nwas the period when the press lacked the facility to rapidly furnish\r\nthe people with the events which were occurring in all directions.\r\nNewspapers still depended upon the mails. Home events were many weeks\r\nreaching sections remote from their happening. In this respect there\r\nhad been some little improvement at the close of the first half of\r\nthe century. That was the time when the electrical current was being\r\nbrought into operation in the transmission of signals from which\r\nmessages were being recorded, and these were being utilized for the\r\nsending of information at short distances. Scientific men were even\r\ntalking of the possibility of connecting distant points on the coast,\r\nand whispering their hope for an Atlantic cable. In 1858 that wonderful\r\nevent came to pass. The old world and the new were connected by cable\r\nfrom Valencia Bay, in Ireland, to Newfoundland, in North America,\r\nand messages of greeting passed between Queen Victoria and President\r\nBuchanan. The break which followed soon after the opening of this cable\r\nstimulated men of genius and men of capital to further efforts, and the\r\ngovernments of the United States and Great Britain came forward with\r\ngenerous aid. The laying of the Atlantic cable by the Great Eastern\r\nin 1864, and its successful operation in 1866, opened the doors for\r\nthe possibilities of the press of to-day, and the realization of such\r\nscenes as were witnessed in this country on September 2, 1870.\r\n\r\nBetween that memorable year, 1866, and this, 1899, how wonderful has\r\nbeen the advance in the transmission of information from all quarters\r\nof the globe. From the Transvaal Republic, in South Africa; from the\r\ndesert home of the Dervish in the Soudan; from the domain of Turkey’s\r\nSultan, in Armenia; from the Holy Land; from the Oriental empires\r\nof China and Japan; from the snow-clad land of the Czar in Siberia;\r\nfrom the Bosphorus to the English Channel; from Valencia across the\r\nAtlantic; from Victoria Land in North America to Patagonia in South\r\nAmerica; from Maine to Mexico; from the Atlantic to the Pacific; there\r\nare each day transmitted all occurrences of interest transpiring,—and\r\nthese encompass peace and war, joy and sorrow, science and art,\r\neducation and trade,—events which arouse the passions and quicken the\r\npulse of humanity.\r\n\r\nThis is done through the medium of an organization known as the\r\nAssociated Press. This wonderful combination has nearly forty thousand\r\nmiles of wire from the different telegraph companies, for which there\r\nis paid a fixed price per mile. This, however, does not include its\r\ncable service, the charges for which are according to the number of\r\nwords transmitted. The service of this organization costs a million and\r\na half a year, divided among several hundred of the great newspapers\r\nof the United States. During the recent conflict between Spain and the\r\nUnited States its expenditure for war news alone was nearly $500,000.\r\nThis can readily be understood when the reader is informed that the\r\ncable rate from Manila was $2.37 a word. Thus, a dispatch filling less\r\nthan a quarter of a column of the average daily paper cost $1000. The\r\nrate from Porto Rico, at the outbreak of hostilities, was $1.90 a word,\r\nand it often happened that a single dispatch covering the movements\r\nof a body of troops in that island, with possibly a pen picture of a\r\nskirmish with the Spaniards, would cost $2000 in gold. The Santiago\r\ntoll was $1.10 a word; and whole pages of newspapers were printed at\r\nthat rate.\r\n\r\nWhat a gigantic institution it has become for the rapid dissemination\r\nof news events!\r\n\r\nIn that war between Spain and the United States, General Toral, the\r\nSpanish commander, surrendered Santiago on July 14, at 2.15 o’clock\r\nin the afternoon. At 2.25 o’clock the message announcing the fact was\r\nreceived in Philadelphia. On the 12th of August following, at 4.23\r\no’clock in the afternoon, the Peace Protocol was signed in Washington\r\nby the French Ambassador Cambon and Secretary of State Day, and at\r\n4.27 o’clock—four minutes later—the information was in the New York\r\noffice of the Associated Press. Hundreds of such instances of this\r\nrapid transmission of news could be recorded in this last year of the\r\nnineteenth century,—facts never even dreamed of when Benjamin Franklin\r\nchained the electric current in the closing years of the eighteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe journey of a piece of news from the far East to the far West is\r\nsomething worth noting. The trip covers thousands of miles out of a\r\ndirect route. As for instance, when Admiral Dewey annihilated the\r\nSpanish fleet in the Bay of Manila, on May 1, 1898, the fact was cabled\r\nto Hong Kong, China. There an operator transmitted it northward to\r\nHelampo in Russia, right on the border line of Manchooria, from which\r\nplace it was sent across Russia to Tomsk, thence to St. Petersburg.\r\nFrom the Russian capital it zigzagged to Berne, in Switzerland;\r\nthence to Paris; thence across the channel to Penzance, and finally\r\nto Valencia, to be put on the cable for America. In two hours from\r\nthe time the operator in Hong Kong started his dispatch, it was being\r\nhurried across the American continent—north, west, east, south—for\r\ndistribution in the newspaper offices.\r\n\r\nWhen a party of Mohammedans attacked a Christian mission in Calcutta,\r\na telegraph operator dispatched the news to Bombay, whence it was\r\ntransmitted to Aden. The next point reached was Suez, from which it was\r\nsent to Malta. It was next sent to Lisbon. From there it was given to\r\nParis. From Malta it was also cabled to Penzance, thence to Valencia,\r\nand finally to the United States.\r\n\r\nWhen that Manila piece of news from Admiral Dewey reached the Pacific\r\ncoast in the United States, the date of its being started was yet\r\nseveral hours behind the time of its arrival. The attack on the Spanish\r\nfleet was made on Sunday, May 1, Manila time. The fact was not sent out\r\nby Dewey until the following morning, May 2 (still Manila time). It was\r\nstarted on its westward course that morning (May 2) at ten o’clock. By\r\nthe route taken to Valencia with the relays, two hours were consumed.\r\nThis brought it to London about three o’clock on that morning of May 2,\r\nowing to the difference in time. Traveling westward across the Atlantic\r\nocean in advance of the sun, it reached New York about ten o’clock in\r\nthe night of May 1. But little time was lost in retransmission to the\r\nPacific coast, which point it reached about six o’clock on that Sunday\r\nevening of May 1—fourteen hours previous, by the day of the month, to\r\nits being started from Manila.\r\n\r\nIn this work of sending out news not a moment is lost that can be\r\navoided. The aid of the typewriter enables the operator to keep pace\r\nwith the sending operator, and his pace has been increased in the past\r\nfew years by the introduction of a code system. Here is a specimen of\r\nthe code system as used by the operator in sending out a news item:—\r\n\r\n“Madrid, March 17—T Qn Regent h sined t Treaty of Peace btn Spn &\r\nt Uni Stas. T treaty wb frwded to t French Ambsdr, Jules Cambon, at\r\nWashn, fo exg w t one sined by Pr McKinley.

Brunetti, Duke d’Arcos, fmr Spnh Mir to Mex, wos\r\nwif is an Amn.”\r\n\r\nWhen this seemingly incomprehensible conglomeration of letters leaves\r\nthe hand of the receiving operator it reads as follows:—\r\n\r\n“Madrid, March 17—The Queen Regent has signed the Treaty of Peace\r\nbetween Spain and the United States. The treaty will be forwarded to\r\nthe French Ambassador, Jules Cambon, at Washington, for exchange with\r\nthe one signed by President McKinley. No decree on the subject will be\r\npublished in the ‘Official Gazette.’\r\n\r\n“Official relations between the two governments will now be promptly\r\nrenewed. It is rumored that the Minister to the United States will be\r\nSeñor Don J. Brunetti, Duke d’Arcos, former Spanish Minister to Mexico,\r\nwhose wife is an American.”\r\n\r\nThe London “Times” recently has been experimenting with a scheme\r\nwhereby reporters in the Houses of Parliament operate the typesetting\r\nmachines in the London office by the wire from their quarters in\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nIt is only a question of time when this practice comes into use in the\r\nreporting of all legislative proceedings.\r\n\r\nIn some of the New York newspaper offices, the receiving operator sits\r\nat a typesetting machine and puts into type the messages which come\r\nover the wires.\r\n\r\nHow rapidly we have advanced in this direction in the last half of the\r\nnineteenth century is thus shown. What will be done by our successors\r\nin the first half of the twentieth century, no man can at this time\r\nsatisfactorily predict.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. TYPE-MAKING, STEREOTYPING, PICTURE-MAKING.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of the small metal pieces called type has undergone\r\nlittle change in this nineteenth century. That which has been done\r\nhas been in the way of producing artistic designs, so arranged that\r\ncombinations can be formed pleasing to the eye, and an aid to rapid\r\nworkmanship. The machinery in use has lost its crudity, the production\r\nhas been increased, and the finish become more perfect. The setting of\r\ntype by machinery has been a serious blow to this industry, and the\r\ntime will come when it will be devoted entirely to the making of job or\r\nfancy types.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Franklin attempted to make metal type in this country, but he\r\ndid not succeed. It was not until 1796 that type-making was commenced\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nAs in many other departures in the printing business, the city of\r\nPhiladelphia took the lead. Binney and Ronaldson, of Edinburgh,\r\nScotland, established the first foundry in this country, operating\r\nit in Philadelphia. After a severe struggle and with some aid from\r\nthe State, a business was established by the two Scotchmen, which\r\nafterwards became known as the Johnson Foundry, under MacKellar, Smiths\r\n& Jordan, which is still in existence. They were followed by David\r\nBruce, also a Scotchman, and by 1813 foundries had been established in\r\nNew York and other large cities.\r\n\r\nSince that time improvements have been introduced, but nothing has\r\ncome forth which deserves to be ranked with the printing-press or the\r\ntypesetting machine.\r\n\r\nThe type founder will tell you how much better are the machines used\r\nin 1899 than those which produced type in 1850. But he cannot point\r\nout any device connected with it which the mechanical world can\r\ndesignate as marvelous, or the people at large regard as a wonderful\r\ninvention. Type once was rubbed into smoothness by boys. Now it is\r\ndone automatically on the machine. By the hand process about four\r\nhundred types an hour were cast; by the present mechanism a speed of\r\nsix thousand an hour has been acquired. Until about 1875, this output\r\nhardly met the demand; now it will do so. Before many years it will be\r\nfar in excess of the requirements.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nStereotyping is the art of making plates cast in one piece of type\r\nmetal from the surface of one or more pages of type. In the beginning\r\nof the nineteenth century, stereotyping was used to an exceedingly\r\nlimited extent. The printers were prejudiced against it for reasons\r\npurely selfish. It was not until 1813 that it was introduced into the\r\nUnited States, and only a few years previously Lord Stanhope introduced\r\nit into the English printing business. “The Larger Catechism of the\r\nWestminster Assembly” professes on its title-page to have been the\r\nfirst work stereotyped in America. It bears the date of June, 1813. Now\r\nthe process is in general use—plaster, clay, and papier mâché being\r\nused.\r\n\r\nThe process of stereotyping originally was to preserve the pages, so\r\nthat an entire edition of a work could be finished without requiring\r\nlarge numbers of type, and to have it ready for future editions. For\r\nnewspaper work it came into vogue to save the rapid wearing out of the\r\ntype by the impressions made.\r\n\r\nFrom the practical introduction of stereotyping in this country,\r\nin 1813, by Robert Bruce, until about 1850, the slow, tedious, and\r\ntroublesome process of making the plates by plaster of Paris was in\r\nvogue. That was done by the plaster being poured over the face of the\r\ntype. Molten lead was then run into the cast, after which the plate\r\nwas finished. The time thus occupied caused the work to be confined to\r\nbooks, magazines, and weekly issues of small journals. When the plate\r\nwas taken from the cast it was rough, imperfect, and unfit for use.\r\nMen, whose specialty was finishing, were employed to make the plate so\r\nas to meet the requirements of the printing press.\r\n\r\nIt was just at the opening of the last half of the nineteenth century\r\nthat papier mâché began to be used in this country. A few years before\r\nthat time it had been brought into use in London and Paris. Its\r\nintroduction into the United States found the printing trade ready\r\nand willing to accept it, and but a few years passed before it came\r\ninto general use by the newspapers. It is a peculiar combination. The\r\npaper matrix is formed by paste of starch, flour, alum, and water.\r\nThis is spread over a thick paper, on which are placed layers of fine\r\ntissue paper. When ready for use, it is placed on the face of the type\r\nand a deep impression secured by being passed through a press. Then\r\nit goes into a steam chest to be dried, from there it is passed into\r\nthe casting machine, the molten metal poured in, and a few minutes\r\nthereafter the plate is ready for the press. Up to a few years ago, the\r\nimpression on papier mâché was secured by being beaten with brushes\r\nprepared for that use. The method had two disadvantages,—consumption\r\nof time and destruction of type. The press now used obviates these\r\ndefects. The old way took about twenty minutes to produce a plate. Now\r\nit is done in from five to seven minutes. The machinery here introduced\r\nhas been of benefit to the trade, but none of it ranks among the great\r\ninventions of the century.\r\n\r\nThe making of electrotype plates had its origin early in the century,\r\nwhen it was found that stereotype plates had a limit as to durability.\r\nElectroplating suggested to Josiah Adams, in 1839, the idea of a\r\ncopper surface for the stereotype plate. It took ten years to bring\r\nit into practical use. His first successful work in this line was on\r\nthe engravings and borders for a Bible issued in New York. It was\r\nfound to be particularly adapted to engravings, producing a surface\r\nof sufficient smoothness to allow the pressman to make a print of\r\nexquisite fineness. The improvements introduced tended only toward\r\nthe saving of time and the excellence of finish. Practically the\r\nsame process is used now that was employed half a century ago. An\r\nimpression of the type is made on wax, the electric current is secured\r\nby a deposit of fine graphite, the mold is placed in a bath containing\r\na solution of sulphate of copper and is made part of the electric\r\ncircuit, in which also is introduced a zinc element in a sulphuric acid\r\nsolution. The current deposits a film of copper on the graphite surface\r\nof the mold. When it has assumed a sufficient thickness, it is taken\r\nfrom the bath, the wax is removed, and the copper shell trimmed. It is\r\nthen backed with an alloy of type metal. The finishing process brings\r\nthe plate to the proper thickness, after which it is blocked to the\r\nheight required for printing. That is the process. To it in the last\r\nten years there has been applied the use of steam machinery. In the old\r\ndays the making of electrotypes required from ten to fifteen hours.\r\nThey now are produced in from two to three hours.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe close of the nineteenth century witnesses the disappearance\r\nentirely from the printing establishment of the once generally\r\nused wood engraving. The rise and fall of this once splendid art\r\nis practically encompassed in the period of time covered by the\r\nnineteenth century. Thomas Bewick, an Englishman, gave wood engraving\r\nan artistic impetus by the production of illustrations for his\r\n“Histories of British Quadrupeds,” which appeared about 1790. Up to\r\nthat period the work was crude. The books and magazines of the first\r\ndecade of the century were illustrated in a way then regarded as highly\r\nartistic. The application of the Bewick method brought forth work which\r\nranked in the line of high art. Of the development of this work volumes\r\ncould be written. To simplify the situation it is only necessary to\r\nrecall how these pictures were made. Squares of boxwood were used,\r\non the face of which was spread a preparation of water-color Chinese\r\nwhite. On this surface the artist drew his picture, and then the\r\nengraver’s art was brought into requisition—the engraving being done\r\nalongside the pencil lines.\r\n\r\nAnd here it was that the artistic instinct of the handler of the\r\n“graver” appeared,—the delicacy of touch being shown in the shading\r\nand in the finish of the lines. By this method there have been produced\r\nrare works of art, as can be seen by an examination of the books\r\nprinted in the first half of the century.\r\n\r\nThe time taken in the making of the engravings, however, prevented\r\nthe possibility of their being used by the newspapers and magazines\r\nas generally as was desired. This want was in a measure met by the\r\nintroduction of machine “grooving.” The cuts, however, could not be\r\nused to print from directly in consequence of the warping of the\r\nboxwood, and it was necessary in every instance to make stereotype or\r\nelectrotype plates. Then, too, came the realization of the fact that\r\nthe reproduction of portraits needed something which would preserve\r\nfeatures and expression. In those days some of the pictures produced\r\nwere ludicrous in the extreme, and it became a standing joke in the\r\nnewspapers that the best way to cast ridicule upon a public man was\r\nto print his picture. In the work of reproducing scenes the skill\r\nof the artist and the engraver frequently brought forth results\r\nwhich were marvels of excellence. For a number of years the wood\r\nengraving business flourished in this particular line, despite the\r\ndissatisfaction existing in regard to portrait work. In the production\r\nof illustrations for fine books, printed on good paper with flat\r\npresses and properly “under-” or “overlaid,” there was attained a\r\ndegree of perfection in lines and shading which raised the pictures\r\nalmost to the rank of steel and copperplate engravings. Many of those\r\nengaged in the work of drawing and cutting were possessed of a skill\r\nwhich would have won for them distinction in other artistic lines.\r\n\r\nThis, practically, was the condition of the profession when the end of\r\nthe first half of the nineteenth century had been reached. Even then,\r\nhowever, the question of a substitute was under severe consideration\r\nin scientific as well as artistic circles. Experiments were made\r\nwith copper, acids, and zinc, but satisfactory results could not be\r\nobtained. It was not until 1860 that a successful substitute was\r\nproduced. Gillot, a Frenchman, brought forth a system of etching. By\r\nthis means a photograph from an artist’s drawing was placed above a\r\nplate of gelatine, chemically sensitized. The parts of the gelatine\r\nexposed to the light became hard, and the remainder was brushed away\r\nwith warm water. From this an electrotype could be made directly. That\r\nprocess has given way to the present system of photographing on zinc,\r\nand the use of acid baths for etching. Other improvements—principally\r\nthe use of the screen—have resulted in the production of half-tones\r\nwhich are highly satisfactory in newspaper work. By this means there\r\ncan be produced such reproductions as give the features of persons so\r\nthat recognition is as easy as in the case of photographs. With the\r\naid of different sizes of screens, backgrounds are secured which add\r\nmaterially to the artistic excellence of the pictures. So well done is\r\nthe work in this direction that the plates can be used on the curved\r\ncylinders of the huge octuple presses, and enormous editions are\r\nprinted from them. The peculiarity of this process is that the original\r\ncan be reduced or enlarged so as to suit any width of column or page\r\nwithout affecting one way or the other the fineness of the work. Pen\r\nand ink drawings made by artists are photographed and backgrounded\r\nwith the utmost accuracy as to design and detail. It has been found,\r\nhowever, that scenes in half-tones do not give as much satisfaction as\r\ndo portraits, and it is believed to be only a question of time when\r\nthere is a return to line engravings so far as the newspapers are\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nWhen one compares the photographic reproductions which appear in the\r\nmagazines and newspapers of to-day with those of even ten years ago,\r\nthere is seen an advancement which tells a wonderful story of the\r\nrapid march of artistic taste. The outline picture—excellent of its\r\nkind—has the appearance of crudity almost grotesque when placed beside\r\nthe life-like half-tone reproduction of photographic art.\r\n\r\nWood engraving has been relegated to the days of the hand-press, the\r\nmail news-carrier and the plaster of Paris process of stereotyping.\r\nInventive genius not only has advanced for the printing press and its\r\nadjuncts; it has also laid a heavy hand on art, causing it to pause and\r\nconsider how soon the pencil and the brush will be superseded entirely\r\nby the rhythmic motion of the machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CENTURY’S PROGRESS IN MINES AND MINING\r\n\r\nBY GEO. A. PACKARD,\r\n\r\n_Metallurgist and Mining Engineer_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we consider how largely the discovery and exploration of America\r\nwas due to the search for mines, that the precious metals might be\r\nfound to replenish the depleted treasuries of European monarchs; and\r\nwhen we note that, as a result of this search, the world’s annual\r\nproduction of gold and silver had increased in the three hundred years\r\nfollowing the discovery from $5,508,000, in 1500, to $48,995,000 at the\r\nbeginning of the nineteenth century, we view with surprise the little\r\nprogress made during this period in the art of mining.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the present century, we find in use the same\r\ngeneral methods that were followed in the time of Columbus. The very\r\nfirst operation—the search for veins—was oftentimes conducted\r\nafter the manner of the Middle Ages; for in Pryce’s “Mineralogia\r\nCornubiensis,” which seems to have been one of the leading works on\r\nmining of the last century, there occurs, among other methods, a\r\nlengthy treatise on “How to Discover Mines by the Sole Virtue of the\r\nHazel-tree.” Powder, although it had been invented for centuries, had\r\nbeen so little employed in mining that it was considered merely as a\r\nlast resort. In a description of mining methods, another work says:\r\n“The soft vein is generally dug with the spade and turned out into\r\nwooden trays; but the hard veins are knocked out with a gad and a\r\nhammer. If the ore is so hard as to be incapable of breaking it in this\r\nmanner, they usually soften it with fire. But a still more expeditious\r\nmethod is the working with gunpowder. _A small quantity of powder does\r\ngreat things this way._”\r\n\r\nIn 1800 the coal miner was working by the naked light of the tallow\r\ndip. Cast-iron rails had been introduced but a few years, and rails of\r\nwrought iron, which could be bent to follow the curves of the drifts,\r\nwere unheard of. The cars were pushed along the levels by boys. Water\r\npower, where it could be obtained and applied by means of the overshot\r\nwheel, was in general use for pumping, hoisting, and ventilating. But\r\nfrom many a mine the ore was raised by women, who pulled the bucket\r\nup “by walking away with the end of the rope” which passed from them\r\nover a sheave and thence down the shaft. In places the ore was still\r\ncarried up the steep inclines to the surface on the backs of women and\r\ngirls. Ventilation, when not secured by natural means, was obtained by\r\nbellows operated by men or mechanically. A mine which had been worked\r\nto a depth of one thousand feet was extraordinary. Though steam power,\r\napplied in the form of what was known as the atmospheric engine, a\r\ndevice utilizing for suction the vacuum formed by the condensation of\r\nsteam in a chamber, had been used for years in draining mines, the\r\nsteam engine, as invented by Watt, had been introduced for hoisting\r\nin only a few places. The power was applied to turn a long crank arm,\r\nwhich rotated the drum.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the century the mines of Cornwall, which were the\r\ngreatest producers in Great Britain, were turning out about 5,000,000\r\npounds of tin and 10,000,000 pounds of copper a year, while the whole\r\nUnited Kingdom was furnishing only 170,000 tons of iron. South America\r\nwas the greatest producer of gold and silver, wonderfully rich mines\r\nof the latter having been found in Peru and Chile. Humboldt places the\r\nproduction of the whole South American continent for the year 1800 at\r\n691,625 pounds of silver and 9900 pounds of gold.\r\n\r\nThe United States at that time had practically no mining within its\r\nborders. Some small mines of iron, lead, and copper, which had been\r\nopened to supply the demands created by the Revolution, were producing\r\nspasmodically; but even as late as 1821, William Keating, in an address\r\nbefore the American Philosophical Society, said, “Upon the whole we\r\nthink we may be warranted in saying that there are as yet no mines in\r\nactivity in the United States. Coal, in most places, is taken from the\r\nsurface, or dug from the foot of a hill. The lead mines of Missouri are\r\nrich and abundant, but the mining is a mere pilfering of the richest\r\nspots.”\r\n\r\nIn 1801 the Cornish pumping system was introduced. A long rod,\r\nextending from the surface to the bottom of the shaft, operates\r\nsimultaneously a series of pumps placed, one above the other, at\r\nintervals of about two hundred and fifty feet. The lowest one lifts the\r\nwater from the pump and delivers it into a tank from which the next one\r\ndraws its supply, and this in turn forces it up to a higher tank. With\r\nthis improved means of drainage mines began to be sunk deeper, a depth\r\nof three thousand feet having been reached with this method of pumping.\r\nThe manufacture of iron pumps, which had begun to replace wooden ones\r\ntoward the end of the eighteenth century, decreased the amount of\r\nrepairs necessary on the pumps, and aided in making possible better\r\narrangement of underground work.\r\n\r\nIt was at about this time, the beginning of the present century, that\r\nthe method of opening ground by shafts, levels, and raises, which we\r\nrefer to as “blocking out ore,” began to be more generally adopted,\r\ndisplacing the former mode of following down the ore by a series of\r\nirregular, isolated excavations. With it came overhead stoping, in\r\nwhich, after the shaft has been sunk, the level driven and timbered,\r\nand a raise made, the miner begins breaking down the ore from over his\r\nhead, allowing it to run down into chutes. From these it is drawn out\r\ninto cars pushed along the tracks in the level. The waste is allowed\r\nto accumulate on top of the stulls, or timbers, forming the top of the\r\nlevel above referred to, and serves as a platform upon which the miner\r\nstands in breaking down more ore.\r\n\r\nThe invention of the safety lamp, in 1815, is probably the most\r\nimportant event of the early part of the century. Previous to this the\r\nminers fired the gas in the “rooms” with their candles, which were\r\nraised toward the roof with the aid of a long pole, the miners lying\r\nflat on the floor of the level to escape the blaze, and sometimes\r\nputting on wet jackets to avoid being scorched. As first invented by\r\nDavy, the safety lamp consisted merely of a cylinder of wire gauze\r\nsurrounding the flame, much as the flame is surrounded by a glass globe\r\nin the modern lantern, except that the diameter of the cylinder did not\r\nexceed two inches. This was based upon the theory that the gas set on\r\nfire by the light would burn inside the gauze without heating it hot\r\nenough to ignite the gas outside. The principle was correct, and the\r\nlamp worked satisfactorily when carefully used under proper conditions.\r\nIt was soon found, however, that in a strong air current, or if swung\r\nat a more rapid speed than six feet per second in an explosive mixture,\r\nthe surrounding gas would be ignited. As a man walking naturally\r\non the surface moves at a rate of between five and six feet per\r\nsecond, it will be easily seen that even were the speed considerably\r\ndiminished underground,—and any one who has tried to follow a mine\r\nforeman through mine workings knows the speed slackening is slight,—a\r\nvery slight swing of the arm would bring the rate of movement of the\r\nlantern up to the danger point. Another and a very unexpected factor\r\nin causing explosions with the new lamp also developed; and that\r\nwas the great carelessness of the men who used it. Armed with this\r\ndevice, and deluded by the quietly burning flame, the miner would seat\r\nhimself upon a pile of coal, draw forth his pipe and fill it, and\r\ndeliberately open the gauze to light it. As a consequence, for a time\r\nafter the introduction of the safety-lamp, the number of accidents\r\nfrom explosions increased. This latter difficulty, the recklessness of\r\nthe miners, was presently overcome by having the lamps locked, and by\r\ndepriving the men of all matches before admitting them to the mine.\r\nAn improved lamp, introduced by Clanny, wherein the lower part of the\r\ncylinder was replaced by glass, partially protected the flame from\r\nstrong air currents, and also gave a better light. Later, Müseler added\r\nan interior sheet iron chimney, which divides the air current so that\r\nthe hot air does not strike directly against the gauze, and the lamp as\r\nthus improved is very largely used, especially in Europe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SINKING, DRIFTING, AND STOPING WITH THE\r\nINGERSOLL-SERGEANT DRILLS.]\r\n\r\nIn 1831 the safety fuse was invented, a train of powder having been\r\nused before this for firing the charges. The same year a patent was\r\ngranted to Moses Shaw of New York for an electrical device to fire\r\nseveral charges at once. It was at about this time, too, that the\r\nman-engine was invented in Germany. Some miner, noticing the slow and\r\nsteady up and down motion of the long rods which operated the pumps\r\nin the Cornish system, had conceived the idea of nailing steps on to\r\nthem at intervals, and riding up and down. As mines grew deeper and\r\nthe time and labor required for the men to get down to their work\r\nincreased, a special engine, utilizing an improvement of this device,\r\nwas employed for raising and lowering men. This “man-engine” consisted\r\nof two parallel beams, moving slowly up and down the shaft with a\r\nreciprocating motion, the length of the stroke being about twelve feet.\r\nUpon these beams small platforms were nailed at distances equal to the\r\nlength of the stroke. The miner wishing to descend stepped upon the\r\ntop platform of one beam as it started on its down stroke. At the end\r\nof this stroke he found himself twelve feet down the shaft, on a level\r\nwith the second platform of the other beam, which had in the mean time\r\nbeen coming up, and he stepped across on to this, which now began its\r\ndown stroke. Thus by constantly stepping from one rod to the other at\r\nthe completion of each down stroke, he was conveyed to the bottom. By\r\nreversing the process he was raised to the surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INGERSOLL-SERGEANT DUPLEX STEAM-ACTUATED AIR COMPRESSOR.]\r\n\r\nIn general, mining progress was slow up to the middle of the century.\r\nThe production of the baser metals, here and abroad, increased\r\ngradually with the demands of the mechanic arts, but it was not until\r\nthe middle of the century that this factor, joined with the improved\r\nmethods of transportation, and of metallurgy, gave to mining that\r\nimpetus which, though through alternate recurring waves of prosperity\r\nand stagnation, carried it forward until the annual expenditure for\r\ntechnical skill, machinery, and supplies used in the industry is\r\nestimated to-day at one thousand million dollars.\r\n\r\nThe first mining excitement in the United States occurred in 1829,\r\nfollowing the discovery of gold in the South; but these fields soon\r\ndeclined in importance without resulting in any improvements to mining\r\nmethods and machinery.\r\n\r\nThe next mining fever resulted from the inauguration of work upon the\r\ncopper properties at Keweenaw Point, Mich., in 1845. This caused the\r\nfirst mining-stock speculation in this country, and it is interesting\r\nto note that the century closes with a repetition of this same fever,\r\nfounded upon almost the same ground. Yet the conditions have changed\r\nwonderfully. Upon the then barren peninsula, whitened with the tents\r\nof speculators and geologists, has grown up a multitude of towns,\r\nfilled with thousands of people whose labors are performed at a depth\r\nof nearly a mile under ground. Thousands more transport the ore to the\r\nmills, separate the copper from the rock, and cut timber for the mines;\r\nwhile yet other thousands prepare food and clothing and shelter for\r\nall these. During 1898, the copper mines about Lake Superior produced\r\nnearly 160,000,000 pounds of copper, and paid in dividends $6,490,000.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SERGEANT ROCK DRILL.]\r\n\r\nThis district is the only one in the United States where the man-engine\r\nhas been used; but as the shafts were sunk deeper and deeper, it was\r\nfound that even this method was not sufficiently rapid, and the men are\r\nnow lowered into the mines by cages or skips. A “cage” is simply the\r\nminers’ name for the ordinary elevator when used underground, and has\r\ndeveloped from the bucket in use at the beginning of the century. A\r\n“skip” is a car especially designed for use on an incline. The roadway\r\nupon which the skip runs is so planned, at the top of the shaft, that\r\nthe rear wheels run upon a track raised above the one over which the\r\nfront wheels pass, so that the rear end is elevated and the skip is\r\ndumped automatically. At the De Beers diamond mines in South Africa\r\nare two of these skips which hold nearly five tons of rock each. At\r\nthe bottom of the shaft are chutes containing the rock, and when the\r\nskip is in position a man pulls a lever, allowing the ore to run into\r\nit. Another pull closes the chute, a button is touched which rings a\r\nbell in the engine-room, and the skip starts up the shaft. At the top\r\nit dumps itself and returns to be filled again. In the mean time the\r\nother skip has been filled and is going up while the first is coming\r\ndown. With these two skips, making ninety-two trips an hour, over four\r\nthousand tons of rock have been hoisted in less than twelve hours, from\r\na depth of 1250 feet.\r\n\r\nTo handle these enormous quantities tremendous hoisting engines are\r\nused. At the Calumet and Hecla mines is a pair of quadruple expansion\r\nengines which will lift cages, carrying six tons of ore, a mile in a\r\nminute and a half. The “Modoc” hoist, built for the Anaconda Mining\r\nCompany of Butte, Montana, is the largest hoist in the world. It is\r\na double compound beam engine, and is designed to be used in sinking\r\nto a depth of 6000 feet. This machine weighs four hundred tons, and\r\nhas seven separate subordinate engines for use in operating it. Think\r\nof it! An engine so ponderous that smaller engines are necessary to\r\napply the clutches that set the reels in motion; other engines set\r\nthe brakes, and another reverses the action, if need be. All these\r\nare controlled by levers operated from the engineer’s platform, the\r\n“runner” having one foot and seven hand levers to handle. Besides these\r\nthere are two indicator discs, directly in front, requiring constant\r\nattention, for these show the exact position of the cage in the shaft.\r\nYet such wonderful skill have the runners in the control of these\r\nveritable flying machines that they instantly interpret the complicated\r\nsignals, and drop the cage with such exactness that the car of ore\r\nis run from the track in the level to the track on the cage, almost\r\nwithout a jar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INGERSOLL-SERGEANT STEAM-DRIVEN AIR COMPRESSOR.]\r\n\r\nNor is the hoist the only large machine necessary in the equipment of\r\nthe modern mining plant, for in sinking to great depths vast quantities\r\nof water have to be removed. The Chapin Mining Company, at Iron\r\nMountain, Mich., have one of the largest pumping engines in the world.\r\nThis engine is located on the surface, driving the pumps after the\r\nCornish style, though it would be difficult to see much of the pump of\r\n1801 in this magnificent machine. With a ten-foot stroke it conveys the\r\npower to the pumps through a walking beam weighing a hundred tons. In\r\nan hour it will raise nearly 200,000 gallons of water from a depth of a\r\nquarter of a mile.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRIVING A RAILWAY TUNNEL WITH THE INGERSOLL “ECLIPSE”\r\nROCK DRILL.]\r\n\r\nImagine the miner of 1800 “softening by fire” sufficient ore to supply\r\na modern hoist. For the mines which now turn out 2000 tons a day can by\r\nno means be counted on one’s fingers, and 2000 tons means more than a\r\nfoot deep over a whole city block. Before the middle of the century the\r\nuse of powder and drill had largely increased, and in 1845 an attempt\r\nwas made to aid the man behind the drill with a machine which swung a\r\nhammer by steam power. In 1805 a machine was invented using compressed\r\nair in a cylinder, and this was gradually improved until it became a\r\nsuccess in 1861, in the Mont Cenis tunnel. As finally employed, the\r\npower drill is practically a small engine, the drill being attached to\r\nthe piston rod and moved rapidly back and forth by compressed air or\r\nsteam. The machine has three functions: to strike the blow, turn the\r\ndrill, and advance it, as the hole is driven deeper and deeper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INGERSOLL-SERGEANT STRAIGHT LINE AIR COMPRESSOR.]\r\n\r\nSoon after the machine drill became a success dynamite was invented,\r\nand these two have been the greatest factors in bringing about that\r\nrapid development and production which is the most pronounced attribute\r\nof modern mining. Dynamite alone has doubled the amount of ore which\r\ncan be extracted from a face in a given time. Le Neve Foster, in his\r\nwork on mining, gives the rate of advance in driving a tunnel by fire\r\nsetting at two fathoms per month. Compare with this the Niagara Falls\r\ntunnel, driven with power drills and high explosives, 342 feet in four\r\nweeks.\r\n\r\nIt is probably to the power drill more than to anything else that we\r\nare indebted for the development of the air compressor; the exhaust\r\nfrom a steam drill and the heat emitted from the pipes being very\r\ndisagreeable under ground. As early as 1800 a Welsh engineer had\r\nattempted to run a blast by means of a water power a mile and a half\r\ndistant, but it was not until 1865 that machines were operated to\r\nany extent by compressed air. The great difficulty had been the loss\r\nof efficiency, owing to the clearance spaces and the heating of the\r\nair. In driving the Mont Cenis tunnel but 16 per cent of the power\r\ndeveloped was available, and up to 1880 the efficiency was extremely\r\nlow; but to-day as high as 80 per cent is obtained. The air compressor\r\nis simply a force pump with ingenious devices to overcome the loss of\r\nenergy. For ordinary use the air is compressed to a pressure of from\r\n60 to 80 pounds per square inch. This is done in a single cylinder for\r\nlow pressures, but for high pressures two cylinders are used. From the\r\ncompressor the air is conducted to a reservoir, from which it is piped\r\nto the machine which it is to run.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INGERSOLL-SERGEANT DUPLEX STEAM-DRIVEN AIR COMPRESSOR.]\r\n\r\nOne of the advantages of air-driven machines under ground is that the\r\nexhaust furnishes fresh air to the miners and cools the atmosphere. The\r\nresult has been that in metal mines, where there are no noxious gases\r\nescaping from the ground, the exhaust from the air-drills, together\r\nwith the natural air currents, has supplied sufficient ventilation.\r\nIn the coal mines, however, it has been necessary to employ other\r\nmeans. After it was found that, even with the safety-lamp, gas would\r\nbe exploded if a large amount of it had accumulated, more attention\r\nwas paid to ventilation. Levels and shafts were divided to produce\r\na natural current; the size of the drifts was carefully figured in\r\norder to regulate it; doors were put in to compel it to follow the\r\nfaces; devices were adopted to split it, a part going to one room, the\r\nremainder to a second; and boxes were built to carry one current across\r\nanother. Early in the century hand fans run by a wheel and pinion had\r\nbeen employed for forcing the air down the shaft, but it was soon found\r\nthat the circulation produced in this way was inferior to the result\r\nof eduction. Large furnaces were then constructed at the bottom of the\r\nupcast shafts, in order to cause a strong upward current. Again, huge\r\nair pumps, run by machinery, were tried for exhausting the air. By 1850\r\nexhaust fans were coming into use, and these, occasionally replaced\r\nby blowers, also used for exhausting, are now generally employed. The\r\nGuibal, which has been the most prominent of the fans, has been made as\r\nlarge as forty-six feet in diameter. The Capell, which is an improved\r\nform of the Guibal, has six curved veins, or blades, and is made from\r\neight feet to fifteen feet in diameter. It is driven quite rapidly,\r\nmaking from one hundred and eighty to three hundred revolutions,\r\nand having a capacity of from one hundred thousand to three hundred\r\nthousand cubic feet of air, per minute. The result of this thorough\r\nventilation is that the gas is removed from the mine almost as rapidly\r\nas it enters, and often the safety-lamp is no longer needed by the\r\ncommon miner. Nevertheless, it has by no means become useless, since\r\nas an indicator of the presence of gas it is invaluable. The action of\r\nthe different lamps in the presence of gas varies, but in general the\r\nsize of the flame increases in direct proportion to the increase in the\r\namount of gas mixed with the air. Each morning, before the men go to\r\nwork, the fire boss takes his safety-lamp and makes the round of the\r\nmine. When he goes into a room he watches the flame, and if it burns up\r\nto the point which indicates that it would not be safe to enter with a\r\nnaked light, he makes a mark on the wall which serves as a danger line\r\nbeyond which the men do not go.\r\n\r\nAnother machine, which, like the fan, has been developed by the demands\r\nof the coal mines, is the coal-cutting machine. Probably the lot of\r\nno man was as hard as that of the coal-digger at the beginning of\r\nthe century. After he had performed the dangerous task of exploding\r\nthe accumulated gases, he was often forced to work all day lying in\r\nthe most constrained attitude. Applied in this manner, his power was\r\nlargely wasted, and much useless dust and small coal was produced. The\r\nfirst effort at relief was a machine which imitated the miner, striking\r\na blow with a pick worked by a lever, and making as high as seventy\r\nblows a minute. These have been generally replaced by quite another\r\ntype of machine, one which depends on the action of either a rotary\r\nbar, a rotary wheel, or a chain cutter. These machines are operated by\r\neither air or electricity. The Jeffrey rotary bar cutter will undercut\r\na block of coal thirty-nine inches by fifty-four inches in six minutes.\r\nThe chain-cutter is an endless chain carrying cutting knives and\r\ntraveling horizontally. It is claimed that these machines will effect a\r\nsaving of about ten cents a ton in the cost of mining.\r\n\r\nWhen in 1848 the finding of gold in California was reported, followed\r\nin 1851 by the discovery of the Australian fields, large numbers of men\r\nwere attracted to the placer mines, who later, as the placers became\r\nexhausted, turned their attention to vein mining. Nor did hydraulic\r\nmining itself fail to progress. When the placers were first discovered,\r\nthe miner, standing in the shallow stream, washed the gravel, a panful\r\nat a time, and secured from fifteen to twenty-five dollars a day. As\r\nthe placers became poorer he built sluices, and, shoveling in his\r\ngravel, turned the stream in to wash off the light rock, while the\r\nheavy gold was caught in the interstices between the blocks with which\r\nhe had paved the bottom. If the ground became clayey, he brought part\r\nof the water through a hose and used it to break up the lumps in his\r\nsluice box. Then as he gradually removed the gravel and the banks about\r\nhim became higher, he turned his hose toward the bank and brought\r\nmore water from a higher level, until, to quote Bowie, “a forty-inch\r\nwrought-iron pipe has been substituted for canvas hose and a stovepipe,\r\nand an inch stream replaced by a river of water discharged through a\r\nnine-inch nozzle under a four-hundred-foot pressure.” By this means, at\r\nNorth Bloomfield, Cal., nearly a million yards of gravel, containing\r\nbut two and nine tenths cents per cubic yard, was moved in a single\r\nseason, and at a profit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELECTRIC COAL-MINING MACHINE.]\r\n\r\nAs the banks became poorer, the miners turned their attention to the\r\nriver beds. In New Zealand, in the early days, they worked the banks as\r\nfar down into the river as they could reach with a spoon dredge. Then a\r\ndredge was made resembling a ladder of buckets, continually revolving,\r\nand operated by wheels driven by the current. When the river got low\r\nthe current became too weak, and a steam engine was substituted. Then a\r\nrevolving screen was put on to separate the large rocks from the fine\r\nsand, and gradually the modern dipper dredge has been evolved, with\r\nits pumps, screen, distributors, and tables and sluices, handling 2000\r\nyards of gravel a day at a cost of three cents a yard.\r\n\r\nIn 1859 the Comstock lode in Nevada was discovered, and it is to this\r\ndistrict that we owe the “square set” method of timbering, so largely\r\nin vogue in wide veins to-day. Some of the “bonanzas,” that is, pockets\r\nof rich ore, were of enormous size. For example, one found in the\r\n“Gould and Curry” was 400 feet long, 80 feet wide, and 400 feet deep.\r\nAs the walls were not sufficiently solid to stand unsupported, and a\r\nsingle stick of timber was too short to reach across, splicing was\r\ntried. It was soon found that this weakened the timber too much, and\r\nthe method of square “setting” was invented. This consists in framing\r\ntimbers together in rectangular sets, having a square base of four\r\npieces, usually six feet long, placed horizontally as sills. Into these\r\nare framed posts, surmounted by a cap of four additional timbers which\r\nbecome the base for the next set. The timbers are usually twelve inches\r\nsquare, and cost on the Comstock about $10 a set. From 1870 to 1891\r\nthere is said to have been used up on the Comstock 200,000 acres of\r\nforest, valued at $45,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe amount of timber which is consumed under ground in a single year\r\nmust be enormous. Mr. C. W. Goodale estimates that in Butte alone, in\r\n1895, 37,500,000 feet, equal to 3750 carloads, were used in the mines.\r\nAs the timber decays in from five to fifteen years, and has to be\r\nreplaced, efforts are constantly directed toward decreasing the large\r\nexpense which is thus continually recurring. In shafts and levels for\r\npermanent use iron is an economical substitute. Wherever possible, new\r\nmethods of mining are being introduced. Thus in the Lake Superior iron\r\nregions, the mine development is planned along lines almost unheard of\r\nten years ago. In the first place the gravel which overlies the ore is\r\nstripped off, even if it is fifty feet thick. This is done with steam\r\nshovels, which load the gravel upon cars. These are then pulled away by\r\none locomotive while a second places new “empties” in position to be\r\nfilled. One shovel will load from 150 to 175 cars a day; that is, will\r\ntake from 3500 to 4500 tons of dirt from the sides of the pit and put\r\nit upon the cars. This method obviates the use of timber for holding up\r\nthe surface.\r\n\r\nAfter the overlying gravel is removed, should the conditions be\r\nfavorable, the ore is taken out with a shovel. If this cannot be done,\r\nsome method depending on rock-filling is adopted. At the Auburn mine,\r\nafter stripping and driving the levels, raises are made to the surface\r\nat intervals of about fifty feet, the ore broken down around them,\r\nstarting at the surface, and dropped down through them. This leaves\r\nopenings in the shape of inverted cones, having their bases at the\r\nsurface. Additional raises are then made halfway between the others,\r\nand the remaining material extracted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOLD DREDGING ON SWAN RIVER, COLORADO.]\r\n\r\nAt the Fayal mine they take out rooms twenty-four feet wide by three\r\nhundred feet long, with a twenty-four-foot pillar between them. These\r\nrooms are carried up from the first level to the surface, and filled\r\nwith gravel which is run in from above. Then the pillars are mined by\r\n“slicing and caving;” that is, by running drifts along the sides of\r\nthe pillar and caving the ore down from the roof. After removing this\r\nore another drift is run, the roof caved, and another slice taken off.\r\nIt is claimed the saving in timber by using this method amounts to ten\r\ncents on each ton of ore mined.\r\n\r\nAll of these, and many other inventions, have constantly tended to\r\ndecrease mining costs. Yet the industry is carried on to-day in so\r\nmany out-of-the-way places, and under such varying conditions, that\r\nthe cost per ton of the ore mined vacillates between wide extremes. As\r\nan example of what can be accomplished, working on a large scale, and\r\nwhere supplies are easily and quickly obtained, the Atlantic mine, in\r\nMichigan, may be mentioned. This mine produced, in 1898, 370,000 tons\r\nof ore, at a cost of sixty-six cents per ton.\r\n\r\nWith all these wonderful advances in mine mechanics, engineering,\r\nventilation, and lighting, have come the foundation and development\r\nof mining schools, the rise of technical societies, and a general\r\ngovernmental recognition of the importance of the industry. It is\r\nnot so very far back in the preceding century that we find among the\r\nstatutes of England the following: “Stealing ore out of mines is no\r\nlarceny, except only those of black lead, the stealing ore out of\r\nwhich is felony without benefit of clergy.” It would be interesting to\r\nknow the name of the gentleman who owned the black-lead mine, for, in\r\nmodern parlance, he certainly “had a pull.” By 1833 mining legislation\r\nhad so far progressed in England that laws were enacted regulating\r\nthe employment of children under ground. In this country, in 1830, a\r\nstate geological survey was inaugurated by Massachusetts, and this\r\ninstitution has since been copied by many States. The majority of the\r\nStates where mining is carried on have passed laws tending to increase\r\nthe safety of men working under ground.\r\n\r\nAbroad, carefully prepared codes describe the method of lease or sale\r\nof mining rights, and define the rights of owners of ground. In this\r\ncountry the first legislation of this character was in 1807, when the\r\ngovernment mineral bearing lands were withdrawn from sale and ordered\r\nleased. In 1834 the miners refused to pay the royalty, owing to the\r\nlarge number of illegal entries, and in 1847 the lands were opened to\r\nsale. It was not until 1866, after fifteen years of self-government\r\namong the miners of the West, that Congress earnestly undertook to\r\nregulate the acquisition of mining titles on the public domain. Leagues\r\nbeyond the towns, miles from the nearest roads, hurrying from the\r\nscene of one excitement to another, pushed by the crowd of constantly\r\narriving adventurers, with surveyors unobtainable and courts not\r\naccessible, almost without time to measure, and in a region absolutely\r\nunlocatable, it had been impossible for the miner of the West to\r\nsecure a legal title to his land as contemplated by the act of 1847.\r\nAccordingly, there had grown up the custom which gave to the discoverer\r\nof a lode the right to a certain length of it, and it was this right\r\nwhich was recognized by Congress, and became the basis of the law of\r\n1866.\r\n\r\nSo far our story has been of progress, but what shall we say of the\r\naction of Congress, which, in 1872, abrogated this law and substituted\r\nfor it the prolific breeder of litigation called the law of the apex?\r\nTo quote Dr. Raymond: “The leading characteristic differs from all\r\nprevious mining laws of this or any other country. The old right of\r\ndiscovery, which was the basis of the miner’s title down to 1872, has\r\ndwindled under the present law to a nominal importance. It is true that\r\nthe discovery of the lode within the claim is made a prerequisite to\r\nlocation. But the right to follow the lode in depth beyond the side\r\nlines of the claim depends no longer upon having discovered it, but\r\non having included its top, or apex, in the surface survey.” Should\r\nthe miner be so fortunate as to have a vein which outcrops plainly on\r\nthe surface, he may stake out the ground without difficulty, so that\r\nthe vein crosses the end lines. But if his vein does not appear on the\r\nsurface, and he fails to guess its direction correctly, and finds, on\r\ndeveloping, that it does not cross the end lines of his claim, he is\r\nsuddenly cut off from all extra-lateral rights. Or should he, in laying\r\nout his lines along the rough, precipitous mountain-side, fail to make\r\nhis end lines parallel, he again finds his rights limited. Nor has\r\nthis law been made clearer by court decisions, but rather it has been\r\ncomplicated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE POWER PLANT AT JEROME PARK, N. Y.\r\n\r\n(Ingersoll-Sergeant Duplex Corliss Condensing Air Compressor.)]\r\n\r\nCertainly this is a peculiar condition of affairs. The century which\r\nhas witnessed an advance from the hazel rod to the diamond drill,\r\nfrom the spade to the steam shovel, from fire softening to dynamite\r\nshattering; a century during which a clumsy car pushed over cast-iron\r\nrails by a boy has grown to a cable train, and a two-hundred-pound\r\nbucket raised by women has developed into a six-ton self-dumping skip\r\nhoisted by electricity; a century productive of new devices which\r\ntunnel mountains, cross ravines, or sink through quicksands with equal\r\nease; a century which has seen the touch of a button and the turn of a\r\nwheel bring power from thirty miles away to light and drain the mine,\r\nas well as operate the drills and hoist; such a century closes with a\r\nlaw in force in the greatest mining country in the world which makes\r\nlitigation one of the expected stages of mine development.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the century the mining engineer advised where to\r\nsink, the manner of working, and the method of dealing with the water:\r\nto-day he must not only be a mining, civil, and hydraulic expert, but a\r\nmechanical and electrical engineer, a chemist, and a lawyer.\r\n\r\nThe time was when he who leveled forests, built himself a home, and\r\nbrought the land under cultivation, was regarded as the true pioneer\r\nof civilization. In later times the miner fairly divides this honor.\r\nPursuing a hazardous occupation, he has invaded most out-of-the-way and\r\ndesolate places, creating untold wealth, founding towns and States,\r\nand inviting vast and substantial populations. By his industry and\r\nenterprise he has not only revealed the seventy-seven non-metallic\r\nunderground products which in the United States alone, in 1899, had\r\na value approximating $500,000,000, but the twelve metals—precious\r\nand useful—whose value in the same year approximated $270,000,000.\r\nAround his gold mines—deep and placer—have grown California, Nevada,\r\nthe Dakotas, Colorado, and even Alaska; while empires have sprung up\r\nat the sound of his pick and the introduction of his mighty machinery\r\nin Australasia and South Africa. In the development of silver he\r\nhas contributed wealth, population, and institutions to Colorado,\r\nNevada, Utah, Montana, and Arizona. His iron and copper mines have\r\ntransformed the barren coasts of the Great Lakes. The quicksilver mines\r\nof Southern California brought San José and other towns to wealth and\r\nimportance. In the history of Ureka and Leadville, Col., we have the\r\nromance of both the gold and lead mine. And so, whether the miner\r\nunearths the ores, the coals, the wonderful variety of buried materials\r\nwhich nature has provided for the use and comfort of mankind, he so\r\nfrequently becomes the source of wealth, population, and permanent\r\ncivic organization as to give him high rank among the “true pioneers of\r\ncivilization.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART PROGRESS OF THE CENTURY\r\n\r\nBY JOHN V. SEARS,\r\n\r\n_Art Critic Philadelphia “Evening Telegraph.”_\r\n\r\n\r\nI. PAINTING\r\n\r\nAt no period since the Renaissance has there been such marked progress\r\nin certain walks of art as during the period of reconstruction in the\r\npolitical, social, economic, and æsthetic world immediately following\r\nthe French Revolution of 1798. The armies of France, returning from\r\nthe conquest of Europe, brought home to Paris the treasures of art\r\nravished from the great capital cities. The vast public galleries\r\nand numerous private collections established under the first Empire\r\ncontained accumulations of pictures, marbles, bronzes, tapestries,\r\ndecorations, and bric-à-brac brought from Italy, from Germany, from\r\nthe Low Countries, from Spain, and even from Russia and Egypt, of\r\nextent and value unparalleled in the history of the human race. These\r\ntreasures were dispersed under the Restoration and returned to their\r\nformer owners; but, in the meantime, their educational influence upon\r\nthe people of France, and especially of Paris, had produced profound\r\nand permanent impressions which abide to this day. To this practical\r\neducation afforded by the models and examples of all that is noble and\r\nexalted, gathered from the galleries and safe deposits of the civilized\r\nworld, France is primarily indebted for that cultured skill and that\r\nrefinement of good taste which have enabled her to take and hold her\r\nacknowledged position as the leading nation in the realm of art in the\r\nnineteenth century.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the century the art of France was resting inert in\r\nthe bonds of classic tradition. Academic conventionality held almost\r\nundisputed sway; only a few painters of portraits, as, for example,\r\nMadame Vigée-Lebrun, Isabey, and decorative artists like Greuze,\r\nventuring beyond the limits of the hard and fast rules prescribed\r\nby scholastic pedants. The only subjects regarded as legitimate for\r\nartistic treatment were illustrations of mythology or of Greek or\r\nRoman literature. Sacred pictures illustrating the Biblical narratives\r\nand lives of the saints were permitted for church adornment and\r\nfor religious purposes; but historic and story-telling pictures of\r\nthe order now known as genre were classic in subject and academic\r\nin treatment. Even in portraiture, where a likeness was the main\r\nconsideration, military heroes were represented in Greek armor and\r\ndistinguished civilians were invested with the dignity of the Roman\r\ntoga.\r\n\r\nThe high priest of ancient pagan worship in France during the first\r\nquarter of the century was Jacques Louis David (1748–1825). David was\r\na master of such real power that he was court painter to Louis XVI.,\r\ndirector of Fine Arts under the Republic, and again court painter to\r\nthe Emperor Napoleon. His great work, “The Oath of the Horatii,” now\r\nin the Louvre, first exhibited in 1784, was universally admired and\r\nis still highly esteemed. This was followed by a triumphal procession\r\nof classic compositions, the most notable of which were “The Rape of\r\nthe Sabines,” usually considered to be his masterpiece, “The Death of\r\nSocrates,” “Paris and Helen,” and “Brutus and His Sons,” all of which\r\nhave been reproduced many times in prints. David was influenced, late\r\nin his career, by the romantic reaction, as shown by his “Napoleon\r\nCrossing the Alps” and his “Floating Martyr,” but he championed classic\r\nart all his life, his last words expressing an aspiration to paint the\r\nhead of Leonidas.\r\n\r\nThe downfall of the classic dominion in France was brought about by the\r\nrevolt of Géricault and Delacroix, about 1820. Jean Louis Géricault\r\n(1791–1824) was declared by Viardot to have revealed an era when\r\nliberty in art was revived together with political liberty, joining the\r\ngeneral movement of the human spirit in the march of progress toward\r\nindependence. His epoch-marking picture, “The Raft of the Medusa,” in\r\nthe Salon of 1819, created an intense excitement not only in artistic\r\ncircles, where it opened the battle between romance and classic\r\ntradition, but also among the people. Instead of Greek heroes, posing\r\nlike antique statues, this thrilling picture portrayed a group of\r\nFrench sailors, perishing amid the horrors of shipwreck and starvation,\r\nthe subject being a scene in the awful tragedy incident to the loss\r\nof the frigate Medusa in 1816, a calamity which the nation was then\r\nmourning with unspeakable grief. Women wept and strong men paled before\r\nthis terrible illustration of human agonies endured unto death, but the\r\nacademicians attacked the work and the artist with almost savage fury.\r\nGéricault, a genius, sensitive and nervous, quailing before the storm\r\nwhich beat upon him, fled to England, but, pining in exile, returned\r\nhome, only to die, crushed and broken-hearted.\r\n\r\nFerdinand Victor Eugène Delacroix (1798–1863) was a man of firmer fibre\r\nthan his friend and fellow-student, and his was the strong hand to take\r\nup the gage of battle when Géricault fell in the fight. For daring to\r\ndepart from the classic traditions, these two young painters of the\r\ncommonplace subjects of every-day human tragedy and romantic drama were\r\nsavagely denounced by the academicians as traitors, as charlatans, as\r\nassassins seeking to murder art. The persecution killed Géricault,\r\nbut Delacroix laughed at it. As Théophile Souvestre said of him: “The\r\nblindness of ignorance, the intrigues and clamors of envy, have not\r\narrested him for an instant in his valiant and glorious course.” By the\r\nsplendor of his genius and the virility of his work, as shown in his\r\ngreat pictures, “The Bride of Abydos,” “The Two Foscari,” “The Amende\r\nHonorable,” and the magnificent series of Oriental studies by which he\r\nis best known, he established the romantic school on a firm basis and\r\nattracted to it nearly all the talented and promising young painters of\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nAmong these students and unknown painters were many whose names\r\nsubsequently became famous, as Horace Vernet, Paul Delaroche, Baron\r\nGros, Ary Scheffer, Alexandre Decamps,—artists whose noble productions\r\ngave to the romantic school its finest triumphs. In the mean time,\r\nclassic art was ably and effectively supported by the distinguished\r\nlabors of Doménique Ingres, pupil and successor of David, Guillaume\r\nGuillon-Lethière, Hippolyte Flandrin, and Jean Baptiste Regnault. The\r\nAcademy, though defeated, still lives, and modern lovers of art find\r\nthat, especially in decorative design, there is much to admire in\r\nclassic subjects.\r\n\r\nAfter the revolt of the romanticists the most important movement in\r\nthe world of art also took place in France, and is known as the\r\n“Revolution of 1830.” To understand this movement it is necessary to\r\nconsider the state of art in England, as the “men of 1830” in France\r\nderived their inspiration from John Constable, an English landscape\r\npainter. At the beginning of the century the two great artists of\r\nEngland were Sir David Wilkie and J. M. W. Turner. David Wilkie\r\n(1785–1841) was a portrait, historic, and genre painter, and no English\r\nartist up to his time had ever attained such wide popularity as he\r\nenjoyed. His pictures are all known the world over, as witness such\r\ntitles as “The Rent Day,” “Village Politicians,” “The Blind Fiddler,”\r\n“King Alfred in the Neatherd’s Cottage,” “The Village Festival,”\r\n“Reading the Will,” “The Chelsea Pensioners,” “Blind Man’s Buff,” “The\r\nVillage School,” and “John Knox preaching.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HOLY WOMEN AT THE TOMB.]\r\n\r\nJoseph Mallord William Turner (1775–1851) was one of the most\r\nremarkable artists that ever lived; a most original genius, “without\r\nancestors and without heirs.” He was a landscape painter and a most\r\nearnest and faithful student of nature, as shown by his wonderful\r\nillustrations, in black and white, of the scenery of England and\r\nWales. In his paintings, however, he interpreted rather than portrayed\r\nnature, investing his subjects with the grandeur and glory of his\r\nimagination. His pictures were “golden dreams,” revealing the beauty,\r\nthe majesty, the sadness, and the terror inspired by nature, not from\r\nobserved details “but from the image or ideal in his own mind.” Of\r\nhis many masterworks mention can only be made here of “Crossing the\r\nBrook,” “Dido in Carthage,” “Palestrina,” “The Golden Bough,” “Hannibal\r\nCrossing the Alps,” “The Slave Ship,” “Battle of the Nile,” “Burial\r\nof Sir David Wilkie at Sea,” and perhaps the greatest of all, “The\r\nFighting Téméraire.”\r\n\r\nTurner created no school and left no successor, but he made a distinct\r\nimpression on the art of England by stimulating an active interest\r\nin landscape painting. Patrick Nasmyth, Augustus Wall Callcott, John\r\nLinnell, and a score of artists turned to the study of rural scenery,\r\nwith the result that they succeeded in establishing what is known as\r\nthe Norwich school of landscape art. By far the most important name in\r\nthe annals of this period, after Turner’s, is that of John Constable\r\n(1776–1837). Constable presents the contrast of diametric opposition\r\nto Turner. His pictures, so far from being “golden dreams,” are more\r\nlike cast-iron realities. When Turner was an idealist, Constable\r\nwas an uncompromising realist. If the one painted poetry, the other\r\npainted prose, and often very rugged, plain prose indeed. While Turner\r\nsubordinated fact to fancy, illuminating his subjects with the glow\r\nof his fervid imagination, Constable devoutly stood before nature in\r\nthe attitude of a worshiper, and faithfully labored to represent as\r\ntruthfully as his powers permitted exactly what he beheld. In contrast\r\nwith the shining canvases of his brilliant contemporary, Constable’s\r\npictures seemed dark, dull, and heavy to the British public, and the\r\noriginal genius of the conscientious artist was not recognized. His\r\ngreatest works, “Dedham Vale,” “The White Horse,” “The Hay Cart,”\r\n“Stratford Mill,” “Salisbury Cathedral,” “The Rainbow,” and others were\r\nexhibited in succession during the second decade of the century, before\r\nan indifferent public, only his fellow artists and a few connoisseurs\r\ncaring for them, the painter meanwhile starving in neglect.\r\n\r\nIn 1824 two of his pictures were shown in Paris, and were then\r\ninstantly understood and appreciated. They created a profound\r\nimpression and, as has been justly said, inaugurated the second\r\nrevolution of the century in the realm of art. By this revolution the\r\nartists were driven out of their studios and out of the city, to study\r\nnature in the spirit of humble sincerity shown by John Constable. Among\r\nthe young students who went forth to encounter poverty, hardship,\r\nand the severest toil were the “men of 1830,” the founders of the\r\nBarbizon school of painting. Millet, Rousseau, Diaz, Corot, Troyon,\r\nDaubigny, and Dupré left Paris and the ways that then led to success,\r\nand sacrificed themselves to what they saw to be the truth in art. They\r\ncarried the study of out-door nature further than ever before; created\r\nthe standard of modern landscape art, and attained immortal fame,\r\nthough not until their leader and prototype had perished in poverty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHRISTMAS CHIMES. (BLASHFIELD.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHISPERS OF LOVE. (BOUGUEREAU.)]\r\n\r\nJean François Millet (1815–1875) has been called the greatest painter\r\nof the nineteenth century, and his masterpiece, “The Angelus,” is\r\nregarded by many as second only to the “Sistine Madonna” of Raphael in\r\nthe brief catalogue of the world’s artistic treasures. He lived the\r\nlife of a poor peasant in the rural village of Barbizon, attracting\r\naround him, late in life, the ablest of the “men of 1830,” and\r\nproducing there those works which have placed his name first on the\r\nannals of our time: “The Sower,” “Waiting,” “Sheep-shearers,” “Woman\r\nCarding,” “The Gleaners,” “Shepherdess and Flock,” and the few others\r\nthat constitute the tale of his exceedingly careful and long-considered\r\ncompositions.\r\n\r\nThéodore Rousseau (1812–1867) was declared, by Edmond About, to be the\r\nMoses who led the landscape painters of France out of the Egyptian\r\nbondage of academic convention into the promised land of liberty,\r\nwhere rivers ran water, where trees were rooted in the ground, and\r\nwhere animals lived, moved, and had their being. As late as 1848 the\r\nSalon rejected Rousseau’s noble work, “The Alley of Chestnut Trees,”\r\none of the finest landscapes ever painted; but this was the last act\r\nof the academic tyrants, the foolish offense against the great master\r\ncausing the old classic pedants to be relegated to oblivion. Rousseau\r\ntook up his residence in Barbizon, and in the forest of Fontainebleau\r\nand the adjoining country studied those rural and pastoral scenes that\r\nhave given him his place as one of the first, if not the very first,\r\nof landscape painters. Of these magnificent examples of landscape art,\r\nmention can only be made here of “The Village,” “A Pool under Oaks,”\r\n“Edge of the Forest at Barbizon,” “A Forest Interior,” “Water Course at\r\nSologne,” and “Hoar Frost,” these being the pictures best known to the\r\npublic through reproductions in black and white.\r\n\r\nIf Turner was a painter of “golden dreams,” Corot was a painter of\r\nsilver dreams; the pearly haze of early morning, the pale sky and\r\nmisty tree-forms of a gray day, and the soft, low tones of a still,\r\ncloudy afternoon attracting his loving devotion and commanding the\r\nconscientious exercise of his skill. Jean Baptiste Camille Corot\r\n(1796–1875) was certainly one of the happiest artists that ever lived.\r\nLike the other “men of 1830,” he was ostracized by the Academy, and\r\nhe was never allowed to receive the first medal of the Salon, but he\r\nhad every other honor and compensation, and, late in life, was given\r\na magnificent gold medal by popular subscription. For many years he\r\ncould not sell a single picture, but, being fortunately independent,\r\nin a modest way, he continued to paint the subjects which, as he said,\r\ndelighted his heart, and to treat them, as he again said, “with truth\r\nto your own instincts, to your own method of seeing, with what I call\r\nconscientiousness and sincerity.” In due time Corot conquered his world\r\nand, in the height of his career, was earning not less than $50,000 a\r\nyear by his brush. He was a constant visitor at Barbizon, maintained\r\na close intimacy with his friends, there, and studied in the vicinity\r\nmany of the hundreds of landscapes his industrious and tireless hand\r\nrejoicingly produced.\r\n\r\nJules Dupré (1812–1889) and Charles François Daubigny (1817–1878)\r\nare distinguished members of the “1830” group, each standing at the\r\nhead of the department of landscape art to which he was especially\r\ndevoted. Narcisse-Virgil Diaz de la Peña, called Diaz (1807–1876),\r\nanother of the fraternity, was not technically so thoroughly trained\r\nas his fellows, but he was a stronger colorist than any of them and a\r\nromanticist of the most pronounced type. Constant Troyon (1810–1865)\r\nwas the most eminent cattle-painter of the century. He came on the\r\nscene after the revolt of Géricault was accomplished, but was in\r\nfull sympathy with the movement, and is usually accounted as one of\r\nthe revolutionists. So also with Jean Leon Gérôme (1824), an artist\r\nsurviving to the close of the century.\r\n\r\nHe first exhibited in 1847, but he took up the line of Oriental\r\nromance, following Delacroix, and made so strong an impression with\r\nhis illustrations of the splendors and glories of the East that his\r\ninfluence in art will be felt for generations to come. After attaining\r\nfame as a painter, Gérôme also developed marked ability as a sculptor.\r\n\r\nIn strict chronological order the birth of the pre-Raphaelite movement\r\nin art preceded the “revolution of 1830,” as the event actually\r\noccurred in Rome, about 1812. The movement was not originally known\r\nby the name subsequently given it, and it did not attain to more than\r\nlocal importance until it was fully developed in England, about 1850.\r\nIt is to the great German artist, Peter von Cornelius (1783–1867), that\r\nthe honor of originating the pre-Raphaelite revolution must be given.\r\nIn 1811 Cornelius went to Rome and soon became the master spirit of\r\nthe “Brotherhood of Painters,” popularly called “Nazarites,” banded\r\ntogether for the study of the thirteenth-century Italians, Cimabue and\r\nGiotto, and their successors in the century following, Gaddi, Simoni,\r\nand Orcagna. This Brotherhood was afterward imitated by Rossetti in\r\nLondon, and its purposes more fully developed; but it was the young\r\nGerman enthusiasts of the previous generation who affected a revival\r\nof the pure religious spirit, the devout simplicity, and the absolute\r\nsincerity of the Italian artists before the era of Raphael.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREEK GIRLS PLAYING AT BALL. (LEIGHTON.)]\r\n\r\nCornelius returned to Germany in 1816, became the founder of what is\r\nknown as the Munich school of painting, and was made director of the\r\nArt Institute of that city. He exercised a controlling influence in the\r\nevolution of modern German art and, indirectly, on art in England and\r\nin America. His pupil and successor, Wilhelm von Kaulbach (1805–1874),\r\nimparted vitality and power to the Munich school, attracting to his\r\nclasses students from all civilized countries. During the second and\r\nthird quarters of this century, Kaulbach reigned as the first artist of\r\nGermany and one of the first in the world.\r\n\r\nDante Gabriel Rossetti (1828–1882) founded his pre-Raphaelite\r\nBrotherhood in London, with John Everett Millais—subsequently\r\npresident of the Royal Academy—and William Holman Hunt, in 1848. The\r\npre-Raphaelite movement gave a richer and stronger color to English\r\npainting in the latter half of the century, and also awakened general\r\ninterest in early Christian art, that is, the art of the Italian\r\nRenaissance. Beyond this, Rossetti’s new departure, though widely\r\nadvertised by John Ruskin, had very little permanent effect. Millais\r\nsoon left the Brotherhood and produced his master-works, the greatest\r\nhistoric-genre pictures of his time, in England, after outliving\r\npre-Raphaelite influences.\r\n\r\nLittle known outside of England, that movement did not entirely absorb\r\nBritish art, as proved by such a man as G. F. Watts, a master of\r\nportraiture, who made studies of many of the most notable men of the\r\ncentury in England, besides many imaginative works of great interest.\r\nOthers were Holman Hunt, with his powerful religious conceptions, and\r\nthe talented Landseer family, the youngest member of which, Edwin, is\r\nworld-famous for his animal pictures. The critic and philosopher, John\r\nRuskin, studied art and became a proficient draughtsman, although never\r\nusing his skill professionally. His literary works on art, however,\r\nhave had so wide an influence that it seems just to include him in\r\nthe list of contributors to art’s progress in this era. His criticism\r\nof the fantastic productions of James McNeill Whistler brought forth\r\na controversy and law suit, resulting in a verdict of damages of one\r\nfarthing to the injured artist, and enough advertising gratis to secure\r\nhis fame. The genius of the latter for achieving artistic effects and\r\npersonal notoriety are equal to his skill in avoiding oblivion. He is\r\na unique and interesting figure, despite his abnormal vanity, for his\r\nunquestionable talent in many lines of art, and is American by birth,\r\nEnglish by adoption, and now French by force of circumstances. Edwin\r\nAbbey is also an adopted son of Britain, although born in America.\r\nHe is better known through illustrative work in black and white, but\r\nhis superb decorations in the Boston Public Library testify to his\r\ngreat skill as a colorist. The most illustrious growth of foreign\r\nseed on British soil has been Lorenz Alma Tadema, whose wonderful\r\nrepresentations of Greek and Roman life place him _hors concours_ as\r\nan artist, and hold before our eyes a mirror of ancient days. Sir\r\nFrederick Leighton, the recently deceased president of the Royal\r\nAcademy, was a true Briton and a leader of modern art in England,\r\nas also was Mrs. Elizabeth Thompson Butler, with her patriotic war\r\npictures, as vigorous as any man’s could be. A talented young artist,\r\nwhose untimely death cut short a promising career, was Frederick\r\nWalker, who is said to have been the original of “Little Billee” in Du\r\nMaurier’s famous novel of student life in the Latin Quarter, “Trilby.”\r\nThat masterpiece takes us into the art atmosphere of Paris, and we\r\nreadily understand why there is the centre of the artistic circle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LANDSEER AND HIS FAVORITES. (BY HIMSELF.)]\r\n\r\nFrom thence have risen most of the great modern names, one of the\r\ngreatest and most honored being that of Rosa Bonheur, who has received\r\nall possible distinction as an artist and reverence as a woman. Her\r\nanimal pictures, especially horses and cattle, are known the world\r\nover, and the story of her early struggle for study, disguised as a\r\nboy, that she might work unmolested where a girl could hardly have\r\ngone, is well known, yet she never renounced an atom of her womanliness\r\nin adopting masculine attire. It is hard to avoid dwelling on the lives\r\nand works of the modern masters, but we must pass over the intermediate\r\nperiod between the revolt of 1830 and our own day, touching only an\r\nespecially shining light here and there, such as Jules Breton, with his\r\nsturdy peasants; Léon Bonnat, Alexandre Cabanel, and Carolus Duran,\r\nwith their elegant distingué portraiture. Besides these are Edouard\r\nDétaille and Alphonse de Neuville, showing faithful studies of soldier\r\nlife and action; Eugène Fromentin, with his picturesque Arabs; and the\r\ndecorative allegories of Puvis de Chavannes. The brilliant Spaniards,\r\nMariano Fortuny and Don Frederick Madrazo, are practically Frenchmen\r\nin their art, although each is distinctly individual in manner. We\r\nmust also mention Vibert, with his delightful little satires on the\r\nhuman frailities of the holy fathers of the Church, and Meissonier,\r\nthe master of exquisite finish in detail, and Passini, with his small\r\ncanvases crowded with Oriental figures glowing with color. In addition\r\nto the great French names of this time are Defregger, of the Munich\r\nSchool; Israels of Amsterdam, Schreyer of Frankfort, whose works all\r\nhold that quality dear to the popular heart, but despised by the high\r\npriests of lofty criticism nowadays, that is, they have a story to\r\ntell, and they tell it.\r\n\r\nAt the time these men were telling their artistic tales in Europe,\r\nsuch men as Washington Allston, the first great painter in this\r\ncountry; Thomas Sully, whose rare works in portraiture entitled him\r\nto paint the Queen of England, Victoria, when a girl; Henry Inman,\r\nalso a great portrait painter; George Fuller, a painter of poetic\r\ndreams; and many others of talent, had said their say in America.\r\nAlmost with the beginning of the new country, public interest had been\r\nroused in the fine arts by the efforts of such men as Gilbert Stuart\r\nand the Peales, Charles and Rembrandt, who bridged the eighteenth and\r\nnineteenth centuries together, and labored to advance the cause of art.\r\nSchools and academies, with adequate galleries for exhibition purposes,\r\nbecame necessary; and such institutions as the Pennsylvania Academy\r\nof the Fine Arts and the National Academy of Design in New York were\r\nestablished. The latter was started in 1802, but did not receive its\r\ncharter until 1808; so the Pennsylvania Academy, which was incorporated\r\nin Philadelphia in 1806, was really the first of its kind in the\r\ncountry. In 1807, the minutes bearing the date of October 8 record as\r\nfollows: “Until the funds of the institution will admit of opening a\r\nschool on a more extended plan, persons of good character shall be\r\npermitted to make drawings from the statues and busts belonging to\r\nthe Academy,” thus showing the humble beginning of art education in\r\nAmerica. Naturally, for many years the facilities for learning were too\r\nlimited to supply more than rudimentary instruction, and the pilgrimage\r\nto Paris was a necessity before an artist could feel qualified to\r\nlaunch out professionally. In these latter days that need no longer\r\nexists, for the great art schools of New York, Philadelphia, Boston,\r\nChicago, and St. Louis can amply provide all that is required; but the\r\ncharm of the Latin Quarter still draws as a magnet all who can afford\r\nto go there.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HORSE FAIR. (ROSA BONHEUR.)]\r\n\r\nIn that centre is a constant mingling of ideas from all sources\r\nseeking new forms of expression, out of which proceed the impulses\r\nthat vibrate through the world of current art. Naturally enough many\r\nof the new departures are futile experiments, short lived and not\r\nsufficiently important to discuss; but within recent years the movement\r\nknown as impressionism has been so widespread in influence, so radical\r\nin method, and so vital in result, that it has doubtless produced a\r\npermanent effect on art. Like its predecessor, the renaissance after\r\nthe dark ages, this _mouvement moderne_ was an upheaval of all forms\r\nof expression; and in painting it seemed as if a wave of dazzling\r\ncolor had burst over the studios, drenching the canvases with rainbow\r\ntints, flooding the exhibition galleries with bewildering brilliance.\r\nThe unaccustomed eye was overwhelmed, and the confused and wondering\r\npublic burst into loud outcry against the insane folly of these mad\r\nyoung painters, who showed purple and green gridirons, speckled with\r\ngreen and streaked with scarlet, and called them landscapes, marines,\r\nand figure studies as they chose. Of course the pendulum swung to its\r\nlimit, the radicals carrying things to extremes after the fashion of\r\ntheir kind, and making foolish caricatures of work that was really\r\ngreat. By degrees, however, sober sense prevailed, the new ideas became\r\nbetter understood, the public point of view changed, and it was seen\r\nthat there was method in this madness. The new movement was intended\r\nsimply to interpret what the artist saw most forcibly expressed by any\r\ngiven subject, or, as the name implies, to record his first impression\r\nand convey the idea rather by suggestion than by explicit statement\r\nand detail. Applied to out-of-door subjects, these principles were\r\ncarried out by the _plein air_ colorists, as they were styled, from\r\ntheir efforts to suggest atmosphere glowing with light, a feeling of\r\nspace and sunshine. Edouard Manet was the leader of the new school in\r\nfigure work, and Claude Monet in landscape. No two styles could be more\r\nwidely different save in their mutual abhorrence of detail; the first\r\ndark, heavy, and sombre in color; the latter luminous and palpitating,\r\nevery conceivable tint vibrating into harmony, an example which is\r\nfollowed in this country by Childe Hassam, often successfully, but\r\nsometimes with extravagance. After reaching extreme high-water mark,\r\nthe flood of brilliance has somewhat subsided, and latter-day painters\r\ndo not find it necessary to observe the world through a prism. While\r\nreturning to more sober statements of simple truth, without trying to\r\ncopy a kaleidoscope, the vision men have had of pure color sparkling\r\nwith light has given them an insight into Mother Nature’s method that\r\nhas left a lasting impression upon the minds and manners of the best\r\nworkers and lifted the whole tone of modern painting. Whether one was\r\nprepared to enjoy truly impressionistic pictures or not, the force\r\nof them in a collection of works in the old manner of hard outline\r\nand heavy shadow could not fail to be felt like a beam of light in\r\na dark room. However one might protest against the invader, the old\r\nfriends looked dull and flat after a time, in spite of the most\r\ndetermined loyalty. The style of the Hudson River school was narrow\r\nand petty, full of trifling little details, the color often being\r\nforced and theatrical in effect. The striking scenery of that noble\r\nstream inspired the efforts of American landscape painters of the two\r\ndecades from 1830 to 1850. Asher B. Durand was a leader among them,\r\nand for many years the manner of a generation past held sway until the\r\nnew method forced a place for itself. It was an amusing experience in\r\nfollowing exhibitions of late years to see, one after another, the\r\nleaders, long established in their own particular methods, finally\r\nbreaking away from lifelong habits and coming into line with the new\r\nmovement, some keeping step bravely with the vigorous newcomers, some\r\nhalting along with pitiful attempts at a jaunty stride. The strong men\r\nneither hung back in sulky indifference nor flung themselves wildly\r\nabout in exuberant freedom, but kept quietly on the even tenor of their\r\nway, absorbing what was best in the new, holding fast to what was\r\nbest in the old, and producing the kind of work that is independent\r\nof schools and eras, but intrinsically great in itself. In Paris, the\r\nyounger workers who began sending strange wild landscape and figure\r\npictures to the exhibition at the Salon of the Champs Elysées, the most\r\nimportant annual exhibition in the world, were indignantly rejected by\r\nthe horrified jury of selection. Equally indignant at their treatment,\r\nthe young painters, who felt themselves to be the coming men, gathered\r\ntheir rejected treasures together in an independent exhibition of their\r\nown, and established a rival salon in the Champ de Mars, which has come\r\nto hold an equal footing in the world of art with the older institution.\r\n\r\nBy reference to “men” we do not at all exclude women, for there is no\r\nsex in art, and women of our time paint as well as men, folding equal\r\nrank in the exhibitions, equal places on the juries of selection, and\r\nreceiving equal honors and awards. One of the foremost women of the\r\nday is a Philadelphian, Miss Cecilia Beaux, whose portraiture ranks\r\namong the highest. Miss Mary D. Cassatt is also a Philadelphian,\r\nalthough long resident in Paris, and highly esteemed there. Her name\r\nis mentioned in a recent notice of a Salon exhibition among those of\r\ndistinguished men, which concluded with the words “and other strong\r\nmen,” meaning thereby no grain of disrespect to the woman, but only\r\nhonor to the artist, classifying her as among the first painters of\r\nthe time. Important exhibitions nowadays are likely to contain strong\r\nworks by many women, such as portraits by Mrs. Sarah Sears of Boston\r\nor Mrs. Rosina Emmet Sherwood of New York, child studies by Ellen K.\r\nBaker, or animal studies by Mrs. Helen C. Hovenden, widow of the late\r\nmaster of modern genre, Thomas Hovenden, whose untimely death the\r\nart-loving public of this country has not ceased to mourn. His faithful\r\nstudies of American domestic life have touched the people, who are,\r\nafter all, the final art critics, despite the claims of those who feel\r\nthemselves especially qualified by taste and training to tell others\r\nwhat they must and must not like. Many times public opinion has been\r\nunduly slow in setting the seal of its approval on worthy works, but\r\nonce established in the heart of the populace, immortality is assured,\r\nand that place belongs preëminently to Thomas Hovenden, as proved by\r\nthe throngs that stood before his picture “Breaking the Home Ties,”\r\nat the World’s Fair in Chicago. That cosmopolitan collection showed,\r\namong other interesting developments, a strong school of vigorous young\r\nNorsemen, hardy vikings of art from Scandinavia, of whom Anders Zorn\r\nwas the leader, with a variety of figure subjects, studied indoors\r\nand out, with an unconventional freedom and dash as inspiring as the\r\nbreezes of his native fjords. Prince Eugene, the handsome popular\r\nsecond son of the King of Sweden, was no mean contributor to this\r\nschool. Fritz von Thaulow is a Norwegian by birth, but being well\r\nrecognized in France he has taken up his abode at Dieppe, although\r\nstill finding inspiration in his native land. He is an exponent of the\r\ntheory of tone in painting, as it is technically termed. This refers\r\nto the quality of harmony, or perfect balance of light and shade and\r\ncolor. It does not depend upon the key of the picture, whether light\r\nand bright or dark and sombre, but consists in keeping the relations\r\nof the different masses of color true to each other, the small details\r\nsubdued to their proper places, yet each having its correct value in\r\nthe whole.\r\n\r\nThe Scotch painters, stimulated no doubt by the success of their\r\nliterary brethren, have established the Glasgow school of art, most\r\noriginal in its methods, and in some cases highly peculiar in its\r\nresults, but with unquestionable strength in its more serious and less\r\nfantastic work. John Lavery is a leader among these men. Germany prides\r\nherself on one of the greatest painters of modern times in the person\r\nof Adolph Friedrich Menzel, a Prussian, born 1815, contemporary with\r\nMeissonier. As the latter was devoted to the Emperor of the French, so\r\nwas Menzel to his hero, Frederick the Great, and their vivid portrayals\r\nof their respective sovereigns will keep the personality of these\r\nconquerors fresh as long as art lasts. For many years Menzel has been\r\nartist laureate to the court at Berlin, painting Hohenzollern family\r\nportraits, battle pieces and scenes of court splendor in the most\r\nmasterly manner. The Hungarian, Munkacsy, has been widely known by\r\nhis huge religious works, lately exhibited in this country,—“Christ\r\nbefore Pilate” and the “Crucifixion.” His work shows great power and\r\nmuch originality in conception, although often somewhat morbid, a not\r\nunnatural condition, as the unfortunate artist has become hopelessly\r\ninsane. The opposite extreme of expression is to be found in the\r\ngorgeous coloring and superb compositions of Hans Makart of Vienna,\r\nnotably his “Coronation of Catherine Cornaro at Venice.” A revival\r\nof interest in religious subjects has recently appeared, possibly\r\nstimulated by the work of Mr. James Tissot, a Parisian, who has given\r\nten years to the production of a series of careful studies of the life\r\nof Christ. These little paintings, numbering some five hundred in all,\r\nare the result of close research in the Holy Land into the conditions\r\nof life and customs which prevailed at the time of Christ, and are a\r\ntribute of religious devotion. Whether through this influence or not,\r\nDagnan-Bouveret has been inspired to paint a number of strong scenes\r\nof biblical subjects, two conceptions of the Last Supper being very\r\npowerful. A young colored man, H. O. Tanner, has achieved success on\r\nsimilar lines, an “Annunciation” recently shown giving evidence of\r\ndeep and original thought. Curiously enough, the women painters of\r\ndistinction do not seem to be given to religious subjects. One serious\r\nlack in most of the work exhibited in recent years is the absence\r\nof any importance in subject. The artists have been so concerned to\r\nexpress what they saw in the simplest manner, that they have carefully\r\navoided seeing or thinking about anything but the simplest things to\r\nbe expressed. While some powerful work has resulted, it has often been\r\nlabor worthy of a better cause, for the pictures produced have had\r\nlittle to tell beyond the skill of the painter. A nobly painted cabbage\r\nfield, or a superbly handled stone wall with the tail of a woman’s\r\nskirt disappearing around a corner, may be masterly painting, but it\r\nis not great art; and it is to be hoped that the day of meaningless\r\ncanvases will soon pass, and the coming painters will not be content to\r\ndiscourse grandly about nothing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AT THE SHRINE OF VENUS. (ALMA TADEMA.)]\r\n\r\nAmong the leaders of current art in America, the place of honor in\r\nportraiture belongs to John S. Sargent, who easily ranks with Boldini\r\nand Benjamin Constant in Paris. He is closely followed by Edmund C.\r\nTarbell, John H. Alexander, with his love for long flowing graceful\r\nlines of drapery, Robert Vonnoh, and William M. Chase. John McClure\r\nHamilton has made some striking studies of some of the most prominent\r\npeople of our time, among them Gladstone and Pope Leo XIII. Elihu\r\nVedder, John LaFarge, Will H. Low, Carroll Beckwith, Abbott Thayer,\r\nand E. H. Blashfield are figure painters whose subjects are frequently\r\nof a decorative or semi-religious character. The latter is noted for\r\nhis literary as well as artistic ability. George H. Boughton, though\r\ncalled an American, really belongs to England, where he paints interior\r\ngenre subjects usually of olden times. John Swan, the animal painter,\r\nis also English. The names of Moran and Sartain are distinguished in\r\nthe history of American art, each family having contributed several\r\ngenerations of talented painters. The elders were contemporary with\r\nDaniel Huntington, long president of the National Academy of Design,\r\nand Eastman Johnson, whose “Old Kentucky Home” was famous. William\r\nT. Dannat, Herbert Denman, Frederick Bridgman, and F. L. Weeks are\r\nall strong figure painters, the last two being especially given to\r\nOriental subjects. Winslow Homer includes figures with his marine\r\nstudies, often presenting groups of peasants on a stormy shore, while\r\nAlexander Harrison and W. T. Richards usually confine themselves to\r\nmarines pure and simple. The ragged, dirty little street Arabs of J. G.\r\nBrown have been exceedingly popular, and so have the landscapes of H.\r\nBolton Jones. The list of modern landscape painters really deserving of\r\nmention is far too long to give in anything like complete mention. A\r\nfew leaders, such as Charles H. Davis, Homer Martin, the late William\r\nT. Picknell, and George Inness must suffice to close our talk on the\r\npainters of this century.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. SCULPTURE.\r\n\r\nHuman progress seems to advance in waves, sending forerunners to\r\nannounce the gathering tide; and the ebb and flow of force is felt\r\nin all manner of endeavor, but in nothing so instantly or accurately\r\nas in the fine arts, the most sensitive and subtle forms of human\r\nexpression. The plastic arts are as keen to record these changes as\r\nthe pictorial, and the coming power of the nineteenth century found a\r\nfew prophets in the dying years of the century passing away. Antonio\r\nCanova (1757–1822), born near Venice, left many graceful and delicately\r\nfinished works. His “Three Graces” and group of “Cupid and Psyche” are\r\nwell known, also his colossal bust of Napoleon and seated statue of\r\nWashington for the State of Carolina. France produced a master in Jean\r\nAntoine Houdon (1741–1828), more vigorous than his contemporaries, as\r\nseen in his powerful work, the seated statue of Voltaire. His statue\r\nof Washington, in the state capitol of Virginia, while preserving a\r\nfaithful likeness, has a singular air of French elegance. Despite his\r\nstrength, Houdon was not more accurate in study than the great Dane\r\nThorwaldsen, born at Copenhagen, 1770. His famous “Lion of Luzerne”\r\nis known to all tourists, and his bas-reliefs are familiar the world\r\nover. His chief religious works, the colossal figures of Christ and\r\nthe twelve apostles, are in the church at Copenhagen, where he died\r\nin 1844. The greatest name of this period in England was John Flaxman\r\n(1755–1826), who was as successful a teacher as he was a worker in his\r\nart. He was the originator of the cameo designs on the Wedgwood ware,\r\nbeing particularly happy in delicate reliefs. Christian Daniel Rauch\r\n(1777–1857) achieved the place of honor among German sculptors of this\r\ntime by his heroic imperial monuments, of which the most important is\r\nthe equestrian statue of Frederick the Great.\r\n\r\nAlthough, for many generations, Rome was the Mecca of artistic\r\npilgrims, and most of the great names have at one time or another\r\nbeen enrolled upon the list of students sojourning within her gates,\r\nthe race characteristics of each strong mind were liable to find\r\nexpression in spite of classic training; and when the mature artist\r\nbrought forth his own creations independent of the touch of school or\r\nmaster, they were likely to present his own national tendencies of\r\nthought. Of late years, with increased facilities for studying other\r\nart centres, of intercommunication of ideas by travel and increasing\r\nduplication of works of art by various reproductive processes, the\r\n“art atmosphere” seems to have extended so as to absorb, and in a\r\ngreat measure obliterate, distinct lines of racial difference in\r\nmanners of expression, the fundamental principles of truth being more\r\ngenerally sought for and applied. Thus, the unmistakably Teutonic\r\naspect of German sculpture in the early half of this century shows in\r\nthe great monument to “German Unity,” by Schilling, at Niederwald on\r\nthe Rhine, and the Walhalla decorations, by Ludwig Schwanthaler, for\r\nKing Louis of Bavaria. German seriousness of purpose lends a dignity of\r\nappearance, even if it becomes somewhat grandiose at times, and German\r\npainstaking accuracy perfects the technique even to the finish of small\r\ndetails. During the same periods, in Italy, the classic influence was\r\nmore dominant where the Roman school still held sway, and delicacy\r\ndeteriorated into insipidity, and finish became finical. Religious\r\nand classic subjects were most frequently produced, beside more vital\r\nwork in portraits, statues, and busts. Some there were who struggled\r\nfor freedom, among them Lorenzo Bartolini (1777–1850), a Florentine\r\nprofessor, whose group, entitled “Charity,” is in the Pitti Palace.\r\nLuigi Pampaloni achieved a surprising fame for his figures of children,\r\none of which, from a monument on a Polish sepulchre, has been widely\r\ncopied in cheap plaster under the erroneous title of “The Praying\r\nSamuel.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NAPOLEON I. (CANOVA.)]\r\n\r\nIn France, the advance of sculpture has been more continual and\r\nconsistent, the national artistic temperament finding abundant means\r\nof expression in the plastic art. The French dramatic instinct has\r\na sure perception of the effect of a pose, the value of graceful or\r\nvigorous lines and the balance of proportion, so that whether under\r\nbonds to academic tradition in matters of technique, or broken loose\r\nand working under individual inspiration, the French sculptor is likely\r\nto create an artistic result. The minds of the common people are more\r\nawakened to artistic impressions through the general excellence of\r\nthe public monuments and sculptural decorations, so freely displayed\r\nthroughout the land, than are the masses in countries where art is at a\r\nlow standard. Until after the middle of the century, French sculpture,\r\nlike the rest, was mainly of smooth and delicate finish and inclined to\r\nbe romantic, though François Rude was powerful and vigorous, as shown\r\nin his patriotic group “Le Chant du Départ” on the Arc de Triomphe. In\r\nEngland, the seeds of Flaxman’s sowing slowly began to bear fruit in\r\nan awakening public interest, though the earlier efforts were sedate\r\nand conventional rather than spirited, the most important works being\r\ndignified and stately monuments and memorials. Westmacott (1777–1856),\r\nFrancis Chantrey (1782–1841), whose large fortune was bequeathed to\r\nthe Royal Academy as the “Chantrey Fund;” John Gibson (1791–1866), a\r\npupil of Canova; Henry Weeks (1807–1877), who made the first bust of\r\nVictoria as Queen; and Alfred G. Stevens (1817–1875), are a few of the\r\nmore notable men of the past generation. Thomas Woolner (1825–1892)\r\nexpressed the feeling of the pre-Raphaelite movement in sculpture, as\r\ndid Hunt, Burne-Jones, and Rossetti in painting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STATUE OF BENJAMIN FRANKLIN. (BOYLE.)]\r\n\r\nAmerican sculpture began with the new century and, like most American\r\ngrowths, began in a very small way; for although Rush had made a few\r\nfigures, notably a fountain now in Fairmount Park, one of the first\r\npieces of sculptural work in the country was that of a poor New\r\nJersey stone-cutter, John Frazee, who tried to comfort himself for\r\nthe death of his child by making a memorial figure of him, although\r\nhe had never seen a statue. From this meagre beginning started a line\r\nof ever-increasing strength, until now, in the plastic arts, as in\r\nall others, we can hold our own with the best in the world. Of course\r\nthe earlier students, led by Horatio Greenough, of Boston, Hiram\r\nPowers, of Vermont, and Thomas Crawford, of New York, made their way\r\nto Rome, where they applied the traditional methods to traditional\r\nsubjects with conventional results. Greenough’s colossal statue of\r\nWashington is in the Capitol grounds; Powers’s “Greek Slave” is owned\r\nby the Duke of Cleveland; and Crawford’s “Orpheus seeking Eurydice,”\r\nnow in the Boston Museum, and “Colossal Liberty” in the Capitol,\r\nare his best-known works. Erastus Palmer, of Albany, contemporary\r\nwith these, developed his talent at home, and secured models and\r\nsubjects from his own neighborhood, giving a distinctly American\r\ncharacter to his work. Among the most noted of the American colony\r\nat Rome, although not particularly given to American subjects, was\r\nWilliam Wetmore Story, of Salem, Mass., born in 1819. Thomas Ball,\r\nborn in the same State in the same year, was of the same class in\r\nRome; but his themes are more patriotic, notably the “Emancipation”\r\ngroup in Washington. Harriet Hosmer is the first feminine name on\r\nthe American list of sculptors. She also settled in Rome, where she\r\ncompleted many works. William Henry Rinehart and Randolph Rogers\r\nwere both of the idealist school, the latter completing Crawford’s\r\nunfinished Washington monument at Richmond. The name of Rogers is\r\nmore commonly connected with the familiar little statuette groups\r\nof every-day domestic scenes so appealing to the popular taste. The\r\nsculptor John Rogers, of Massachusetts, has also made a few large\r\nworks, among them the equestrian statue of General Reynolds, before\r\nthe City Hall, Philadelphia. Henry Kirke Browne (1814–1886) made a\r\nnumber of equestrian statues of note, one of Washington being the first\r\nbronze actually cast in America. His figure of General Scott was cast\r\nfrom captured cannon, relics of the Mexican war. His pupils, Larkin\r\nMeade and J. Q. A. Ward, both attained high places, the latter being\r\nespecially prominent in the progress of American sculpture through such\r\nworks as his colossal Washington for the New York Treasury Building,\r\nand his “Indian Hunter,” “Pilgrim,” and “Shakespeare,” in Central Park.\r\n\r\nAfter the middle of the century, French art became emotional and\r\ndramatic, the notorious “Dance” for the Paris Opera House, by J. B.\r\nCarpeaux, being one of the first of the new utterances. Paul Dubois was\r\nless astonishing in manner, and Henri Chapu was still more restrained,\r\nalthough far more vital than the old conventional school. The name\r\nof Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi should be known to every American by\r\nreason of his colossal statue of “Liberty Enlightening the World,” now\r\nstanding sentinel in New York harbor. This, and his figure of Lafayette\r\noffering his services to Washington, were presented to America by the\r\nFrench government. Antoine Louis Barye (1795–1875) was a sculptor _sui\r\ngeneris_, a law unto himself of his own development; and though he has\r\nmany followers, as a sculptor of animals he has no rivals. In many\r\nbranches of art he was proficient, but his best-known works are the\r\nmarvelous studies of animal life, modeled with infinite skill.\r\n\r\nWhen the great wave of impressionism rose and flooded the land,\r\ncarrying music, literature, and the drama before it, plastic art as\r\nwell as pictorial was caught up too, and whirled into a variety of\r\nstrange forms. Auguste Rodin led the new movement in sculpture, his\r\nmanner being copied with varying degrees of success by lesser lights,\r\nand like all new movements run to foolish extremes by incompetent\r\nfollowers. His heroic group, “The Bourgeois of Calais,” will indicate\r\nhis style. From extreme realism on one side, with portrait statues in\r\nthe last detail of modern costume, silk hats, kid gloves, and in one\r\ncase holding a cigar, to the vague suggestions of a shapeless mass\r\nof marble, out of which protrude unfinished limbs and half-developed\r\nheads, sculpture has been pushed from side to side, but is settling\r\ninto a vigorous, steady, onward movement, in which the best men of all\r\nnations stride along together. In the limits of a short article it is\r\nimpossible to mention all deserving names, but a few will serve as\r\ntypes, and the Americans are well worthy to head the list.\r\n\r\nDaniel French’s grand majestic golden figure of Liberty, towering\r\nabove the Court of Honor, the imperial hostess of the World’s Fair at\r\nChicago, placed him at once on a pedestal of fame. From the prominence\r\nof his beautiful Columbian Fountain opposite the golden Goddess,\r\nFrederick MacMonnies became known the land over. His greatest late\r\nwork is the crowning of the soldiers’ and sailors’ memorial arch for\r\nProspect Park, Brooklyn, with a colossal quadriga of Triumph and groups\r\nof the army and navy. Augustus St. Gaudens, though a cosmopolitan,\r\nis truly an American sculptor of the first rank, whose statues of\r\nAdmiral Farragut in New York, Lincoln in Chicago, and the sturdy\r\nPuritan, Chapin, in Springfield, Mass., are well known. Olin Warner is\r\nanother distinctively American product, although he had the advantage\r\nof some training in Paris. His work is French in technique but not\r\nFrench in spirit, having the native traits of freedom and originality,\r\nas shown in his figure of William Lloyd Garrison, and later in his\r\nrelief portraits on the art building at the Columbian Fair. This\r\ngreat occasion offered opportunities to American sculptors of which\r\nthey took full advantage, showing the high rank to which they were\r\nentitled. It made an American of Carl Bitter, the talented Austrian,\r\nwhose decorations on the Pennsylvania Railroad Station, Philadelphia,\r\nare well known. It added further lustre to the name of John J. Boyle,\r\nwhose heroic “Indian Mother” in Fairmount Park, and seated statue of\r\nBenjamin Franklin, are matters of just pride to Philadelphians. It gave\r\nprominence to such men as Lorado Taft, with his graceful work on the\r\nHorticultural Building; Philip Martiny, on the Agricultural Building;\r\nthe great Columbus quadriga, by E. C. Potter and Daniel French, whose\r\nbeautiful relief of “Death Staying the Hand of the Sculptor” is a\r\nmasterpiece. All visitors to the White City will remember the vigorous\r\nanimal studies by Edward Kemys, and the Indian figures of A. C.\r\nProctor. The sculptural commissions of the Congressional Library in\r\nWashington have produced a remarkable collection of works by talented\r\nAmericans, and every great exhibition brings interesting examples from\r\nthose already named, and such others as Herbert Adams, Edwin Elwell,\r\nBessie Potter, with her dainty little statuettes, portrait work by\r\nCharles Grafly, Catherine Cohen, C. E. Dallin, strange visionary\r\nsuggestions, in the Rodin manner, by George Bonnard, and an array of\r\nlesser names too numerous to mention.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT, FAIRMOUNT PARK.]\r\n\r\nFor this reason, but few of the notable names of modern foreigners\r\ncan be given. However, Hamo Thornycroft, of England, must not be\r\noverlooked, whose famous “Mower” is much admired; nor Onslow Ford, more\r\nyouthful and romantic in style. John Henry Foley, of Dublin, has had\r\na pronounced effect on English sculpture, being a successful teacher,\r\nincluding among his pupils several distinguished women, among them the\r\nPrincess Louise and the Earl of Elgin’s granddaughter, Miss Grant.\r\nGeorge Tinworth’s terra cotta reliefs must conclude the list of English\r\nworks. A few Russians have reached eminence, mainly by animal studies.\r\nAntocolski, a Jew of Wilna, of poorest parentage, has done powerful\r\nfigure work of a serious, rather melancholy sort, the most important\r\nbeing a “Christ Bound.” What is best in modern Italian and German work\r\nis practically French, and of the French themselves the list is too\r\nlong to complete. A few must suffice, such as Jean Alexandre Falguière,\r\nwho aspires, like Carpeaux, to give vitality by means of vigorous\r\naction to his figures. Emanuel Frémiet has worn with some distinction\r\nthe mantle descended from Barye’s shoulders. Vidal, another pupil of\r\nBarye, was blind for twenty years, yet gained two medals for correct\r\nanatomy in his modeling. Carrier Belleuse’s “Hebe Asleep” is an example\r\nof the delicate style, and Alfred Boucher shows the other extreme in\r\nhis rendering of sturdy masculine figures, toiling or racing, striving\r\nto present in sculpture the picture of human struggle for existence,\r\nas did Millet in his paintings. These materialistic studies represent\r\nthe fight for the bread and breath of life, while the impressionist\r\ncontortions of the Rodin school try to suggest the conflict of\r\nemotions, good and bad, and the battle of spiritual and physical\r\ndesires and development.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. CERAMICS AND GLASS WORK.\r\n\r\nFrom time immemorial to the present day men have been fashioning shapes\r\nof clay, experimenting with different kinds, different degrees of heat,\r\nand different chemical combinations to form glazes and colorings. The\r\nfundamental processes of pottery making have changed but little since\r\nprehistoric times, and wall pictures of the days of the Ptolemies show\r\nthe potter’s wheel whirling much as it does at present, although, of\r\ncourse, many modern inventions have been made to facilitate different\r\nforms of work. In the famous Sèvres factories in France, established\r\nunder royal patronage and still remaining government property, a modern\r\ndevice has rendered possible the making of large vases of extremely\r\nthin ware. To prevent the delicate paste of which these are made from\r\ncollapsing by its own weight before it can harden, the vase or jar is\r\nmoulded in an air-tight chamber, the mouth of the object sealed, and\r\nthe air exhausted from the chamber, leaving the object in a vacuum. The\r\nair contained in itself is sufficient to hold up the sides until they\r\nharden and danger of collapse is over, when it can be fired. Attempts\r\nwere made in vain to equal the delicacy of the Chinese egg-shell ware,\r\nwhen, one day an educated Chinese visitor to the factories observed the\r\nmethod employed, and exclaimed, “This is the way we make those cups,”\r\nand, taking a mould, he dipped it into the liquid paste, rinsed it\r\naround and emptied it at once. A thin film like a soap bubble remained\r\nin the mould, which hardened enough to form the dainty ware the workers\r\nhad been trying without success to produce; so the Chinese method was\r\nat once adopted. About the middle of the last century an impetus of\r\ndevelopment in ceramic art appeared all over the continent of Europe\r\nand in England. This was probably due to the discovery, in different\r\nplaces, of kaolin or the fine clay of which porcelain is made, which\r\nstimulated the pottery industry and caused the establishment of many\r\nfactories which are still working to-day. The Dresden works, founded\r\nin 1700, were hidden in an old fortress, and their secrets jealously\r\nguarded. After about a century they went into decay, but in 1863 were\r\nrevived and reëstablished in large new buildings of their own, where\r\ndainty flowered ware is produced, which has again come into popular\r\nfavor. Italian ceramics are apt to be florid and overloaded with\r\ndecoration, that called “majolica” deriving its name from the island\r\nof Majorca, where it was first made. “Fayence” comes from Faenza, and\r\nthe French form of the name, “faïence,” has been used to designate\r\nporcelain in general. The town of Limoges, in France, has been a centre\r\nof ceramic art since 1773, when a French firm established a factory for\r\nthe production of a peculiarly fine ware, made possible by the superior\r\nquality of the kaolin found in the neighborhood. In 1839 a lady in\r\nNew York showed the Haviland firm a cup of delicate ware, asking them\r\nto match it for her. It was so much finer than anything they had seen\r\nthat they desired to import some for their own business. With this end\r\nin view, Mr. David Haviland took the cup and went to France trying to\r\nfind where it had been made. He was directed to Limoges and, in the\r\nfactories there, he tried to have English shapes and decorations copied\r\nin the exquisite ware. The conservatism and slow methods of the place\r\nwere not equal to his demands, and he therefore established a factory\r\nof his own, which, since the middle of the century, has been the most\r\nimportant in the town.\r\n\r\nIn England, the most celebrated potteries are all over a century old,\r\nand the ceramic art has been developed to the highest degree both in\r\ntechnical and artistic directions. The works of the Doulton firm, who\r\nown many potteries, are particularly rich in color, and decoration,\r\nthose from their factory at Lambeth being especially fine. So also\r\nare the Coalport wares, celebrated for their rich blue color, the\r\nRoyal Worcester and the Crown Derby. In these English factories, and\r\nalso in those on the Continent, artists of great skill are employed\r\nas decorators, and in the Wedgwood works the delicate cameo figures\r\nin white relief on a tinted ground were originated by the famous\r\nsculptor, John Flaxman. In America, the Trenton potteries turn out\r\na vast quantity of wares of varying degrees of artistic excellence,\r\nand one factory has the secret of an old Irish ware, the Belleek, of\r\nindescribable delicacy, like an iridescent sea shell, long thought\r\nto be a lost art. The Rookwood pottery, of most artistic quality\r\nin design and color, is made in Cincinnati, and was the invention\r\nof a woman who has trained a school of girls as decorators; as has\r\nalso the Tiffany firm in New York for their marvelous glass work. An\r\nadequate description of the work of this firm would fill a book, as\r\nthey have developed undreamed-of possibilities in the use of glass\r\nfor decorative purposes. They have revived forgotten arts of coloring\r\nand invented new processes of treatment, that give results like\r\nfairy work, no two pieces being alike. These and many other forms of\r\nindustrial art products are brought to a high plane of perfection\r\nnowadays, although the word “art” is grievously abused, being applied\r\nto everything salable, from writing paper to soap. The great schools\r\nand institutions which teach the arts and industries combined are doing\r\nvast good, however, in improving public taste and teaching the world\r\nto discriminate between true art and false, and their influence can\r\nalready be felt in higher standards of decoration in articles of common\r\ndaily use.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. INDUSTRIAL ARTS.\r\n\r\nClosely following painting comes black and white art in various\r\nforms, either reproductive or original work, and it is difficult to\r\ndiscriminate between fine art and handicraft in the many processes\r\nemployed. Engraving on metal has long been known, and steel was\r\nconsidered an especially valuable method of reproducing paintings\r\nuntil within a generation. Etching is another old form of black and\r\nwhite work, and is still popular, though less so than formerly.\r\nWood engraving during this century has passed through many stages\r\nof development, and in the illustrations of books and magazines has\r\nbeen brought to a high standing as a fine art. It is still used in\r\nmany ways, but all those processes that require line work by hand are\r\nbeing superseded by the photo-type processes, of which there are many\r\nkinds. The making of plates or blocks for printing required skilled\r\nhand work, and the engravers and wood-cutters were necessarily artists\r\nthemselves, so that while they were copying the work of others they\r\nwere also producing works of art themselves. The plates and prints\r\nwere, therefore, valuable and expensive, and, as modern haste grew more\r\nand more to demand cheap quick work, the old careful style of working\r\ngave way to mechanical methods of greater speed. With the development\r\nof photography and its application to the engraver’s art, while a\r\ncertain individual artistic character in the work was lost, the actual\r\ncopying of painting in all the details of light, shade, and half tones\r\nhas been carried to a high degree of perfection. By what is known as\r\nphotogravure, every tiny brush mark and every different tint of color\r\nis reproduced with scientific accuracy in black and white. This is\r\naccomplished by having a photograph of the painting taken on a gelatine\r\nfilm, which is suspended in a bath of acid in the line of an electric\r\ncurrent. This current, playing over a sheet of copper, sets free the\r\nmolecules of metal that are deposited upon the film, and filling all\r\nthe little inequalities of the surface, produce what is practically\r\na cast of the photograph in copper. The plate, thus secured, is gone\r\nover by hand and finished here and there with engraver’s tools, and\r\nfrom this prints may be duplicated to any extent. In engraved plates\r\nthe design is cut into the metal, incised lines being either drawn by\r\nhand with a sharp point, called “dry point” work, or eaten in by acids,\r\nthe remaining surface of the plate being protected from the acid by\r\na greasy film. In wood-cutting, the blocks show a reverse process,\r\nthe design being left standing in fine lines, while the remaining\r\nsurface is cut away, so that a wood-cut is in reality a carving in low\r\nrelief. The modern electrotype processes produce a similar result on\r\na metal block by the action of acid, a method capable of most speedy\r\nwork and therefore in demand among the multitude of daily publications\r\nillustrating current events. Of course these hasty results can scarcely\r\nbe called fine art, but they are developments of artistic industries,\r\ncalculated to meet certain needs of our busy civilization.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHOTOGRAPHIC VIEW OF NEW YORK CITY AND HUDSON RIVER,\r\nTAKEN FROM 26TH STORY OF PARK ROW BUILDING.]\r\n\r\nFor more artistic effects, various forms of lithography have given\r\nbeautiful results. This valuable process was accidentally discovered in\r\n1796, by a young Bohemian, Aloys Senefelder, of Prague. Desiring to\r\nwrite a list, and having no paper, he scrawled on a fine stone floor\r\ntile a few words, and later on, coming to remove them, he bethought\r\nhim of an experiment with acid on the stone. This he tried, finding\r\nthe stone eaten away all around his writing, leaving that raised in\r\nsufficient relief to print from, the lettering being done with a greasy\r\nwriting substance that repelled the acid. Later experiments proved\r\nthat the eating away of the stone was not necessary if the design were\r\nmade with an oily material and the rest of the surface kept moist with\r\na weak solution of acid. A greasy printing ink being applied would\r\nstick only to the oily design and not to the acidulated surface, which\r\nprocess made possible the printing from flat stones, which were not\r\nso liable to wear out as the relief designs. Senefelder died in 1824,\r\nliving long enough to see his invention in use throughout the world,\r\nalthough of course he could not know the improvements that photography\r\nwould bring. On the centennial anniversary of this great discovery\r\nin 1896, exhibitions of lithographic works were held in London and\r\nParis, and the possibilities and developments shown. Mr. James McNeill\r\nWhistler has made many very interesting experiments with it, as have\r\nalso Mr. Joseph Pennell and Mr. Hubert Herkomer. The latter has made\r\ninnumerable experiments and inventions in his busy artistic career,\r\nand has just recently perfected an improvement on lithography which he\r\ncalls “plate printing,” and which has been dubbed by the irreverent\r\nthe “Herkotype” process. It is simply painting in a peculiar oily ink\r\non a metal plate, which, while the ink is moist, is dusted over with\r\na fine powder which adheres to every brush mark on the surface. One\r\ningredient of this powder is a metal that is electrically conductible,\r\nand, after the excess of powder is brushed off, the plate, with what\r\nremains sticking on the oily surface, is placed in an electrotype\r\nbath. The copper deposited thereon by the electric current hardens\r\nand forms a negative of the original painting, which can be stripped\r\nfrom the plate and used in a printing-press, giving an absolutely\r\nfaithful reproduction of the artist’s handiwork. A similar process,\r\ncalled “algraphy,” has been invented by Mr. Scholz, of Mayence, who\r\nhas developed the possibilities of aluminum for plate work, the\r\nadvantage of this material over stone or other metal being its extreme\r\nlightness. These processes are especially valuable to artists who can\r\nwork in black and white, as their own original conception is perfectly\r\nreproduced without the possibility of misconception by some copyist, as\r\nexists where a painting is interpreted by an etcher or engraver.\r\n\r\nOf the new processes or improvements on the old, that have arisen\r\nbecause of the discovery of photography, it may be said their name is\r\nlegion. Photography itself is rapidly being developed into a fine art,\r\nand has become one of the most important factors of modern existence.\r\nIt combines science, art, and industry, and is equally necessary to\r\nall these occupations. While it is difficult to state what was the\r\nfirst attempt that led to the suggestion of photography, it may be\r\nsupposed the experiments of the Swedish scientist Scheele were among\r\nthe first. He found that the action of the sun’s ray blackened silver\r\nchloride, and others experimenting after him, at the beginning of\r\nthe century, had glimmering ideas of the possibility of a new art.\r\nAs has so often happened with the dawning of some great idea, some\r\nnew appreciation of a great natural law, the thought was working in\r\nmany minds, and the discovery seemed to be almost simultaneous in\r\nseveral places. As early as 1802 Wedgwood published in the “Journal\r\nof the Royal Institute” an “account of a method of copying paintings\r\non glass and of making profiles by the agency of light on nitrate of\r\nsilver, with some remarks by Sir Humphry Davy.” These gentlemen were,\r\nhowever, unable to fix the impressions they procured, and a Frenchman,\r\nDe Niepce, seems to have been the first to succeed in this direction.\r\nIn 1826, learning that M. Louis Jacques Daguerre was experimenting on\r\nthe same lines, he conferred with him and they formed a partnership.\r\nThe latter seems to have been the more businesslike of the two, and\r\nthe process they evolved became known as the “Daguerreotype.” De\r\nNiepce died in 1833, and Daguerre continued the partnership with his\r\nson Isidore, making many improvements, and becoming really the pioneer\r\nof modern photography. The extent of advance may be calculated from\r\nDaguerre’s own remark, that “a landscape requires seven or eight hours\r\nto be photographed, but a single statue or monument, if strongly\r\nlighted, can be taken in about three hours.” Comparing this with the\r\ninstantaneous camera work of to-day, that gives us the lifelike moving\r\nfigures of the kinetoscope, will illustrate the change wrought in two\r\nthirds of a century. The earliest portrait work was slow and tedious,\r\nthe first portrait in New York probably being produced by Dr. Draper,\r\nthe scientist, although the celebrated Professor Morse was vastly\r\ninterested in the new science or art, and advanced its cause in this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of photographic experiments, the greatest desire has\r\nbeen felt to photograph in color, and numberless attempts with more or\r\nless success have been made, but the processes are mainly slow and\r\nvery expensive. A new method of photo-printing in color, however, has\r\nrecently developed very artistic possibilities. This is accomplished\r\nby means of three plates, one for each of the three primary colors;\r\nthe negative having been made and the plate prepared for printing in\r\neach color, the inks of each color are applied separately. One printing\r\nproduces a red impression, directly on this comes a yellow impression,\r\nand on top of that is put a blue; and as all gradations of color are\r\ncomposed of various proportions of these three primary tints, the\r\n“overlaying” of the three inks produces a picture containing all the\r\nvariety of the original subject. A still more recent discovery makes an\r\nimpression upon a glass plate that gives all three colors on the same\r\nplate; but this process is a secret, and is too new to be classed among\r\nthe successes of industrial art as yet.\r\n\r\nOne of the later and more notable uses of photography is found in\r\nits application to the purposes of astronomy, an evolution in modern\r\nscience, which, although still in its infancy, has already produced\r\nwonderful results. About the middle of the century photographs of the\r\nmoon were secured by Warren De la Rue and other astronomers, which\r\ngreatly facilitated studies of the earth’s satellite, and these were\r\nfollowed by photographs of the sun and the sun’s corona during eclipse.\r\nIt was not, however, until Professor Henry of the Smithsonian Institute\r\noriginated the idea of uniting the camera with the telescope that\r\nthe marvelous possibilities of stellar photography were discovered.\r\nIt is not too much to say that this discovery has revolutionized\r\nthe science of astronomy, extending the field of human observation\r\ninto the realm of the infinite. By the aid of clockwork attachments,\r\nthe telescope is made to follow the apparent motion of the star to\r\nwhich it may be directed, throughout the night, if desired, and the\r\nsensitive photographic plate is exposed to the action of light during a\r\ncorresponding period. “Each image, however faint, has a comparatively\r\nlong time on the sensitive surface, and therefore exerts a cumulative\r\naction.” The result is that stars are pictured by the camera which no\r\nhuman eye has ever seen. It is estimated that the camera has revealed\r\ndouble the number of stars discovered by the most powerful telescopes.\r\nIn 1887, at a convention of astronomers held in Paris, it was resolved\r\nto photograph the entire skies, with the purpose of making a new\r\nstellar atlas to include the latest discoveries among the heavenly\r\nhosts. With this object the firmament was charted in squares, and each\r\nobservatory of importance throughout the world was assigned certain\r\nof these squares to work on. This monumental labor is still going on,\r\nand it will necessarily be extended well into the first quarter of the\r\ntwentieth century.\r\n\r\nThe epoch-marking paper of Dr. Röntgen, in which he announced the\r\ndiscovery of the X-ray, was made public in the latter part of 1895.\r\nIt immediately attracted the attention of the scientific world, and,\r\nsince that date, endless successions of experiments have been made with\r\nthe marvelous ray in all civilized countries. The X-ray produces no\r\nnoticeable effect on the retina of the eye, and we therefore acquire\r\nknowledge of it through indirect agencies. One of these agencies is the\r\nphotographic plate, on which, under certain conditions, the ray acts\r\nsomewhat in the same manner as does a ray of light. It is not a ray of\r\nlight, in the ordinary sense, as it penetrates opaque bodies which\r\nlight cannot traverse. Just what it is scientists are not yet ready\r\nto state, but its discoverer defines it as “a longitudinal vibration\r\nof luminiferous ether.” This vibration will traverse many substances\r\nopaque to light, as wood, paper, vegetable and animal tissues and\r\nfabrics, as wool, cotton, silk, etc.; and, if then directed upon a\r\nphotographic plate, will produce an image there. The resulting picture\r\nis not of the object traversed by the ray, but of any intervening\r\nobject which it does not pass through. As a consequence, the picture\r\nis the image, so to speak, of a shadow, and, hence has been called a\r\n“shadowgraph.” To illustrate, if the ray is directed through a human\r\nbody, it will give a “shadowgraph” of the bones, or of a bullet or\r\npiece of metal, if such foreign substance be encountered on its way.\r\nAgain, the ray will traverse a diamond and cast no shadow, but it will\r\nnot pass through the finest imitation ever made, the “shadowgraph”\r\nshowing the manufactured article.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CENTURY’S ADVANCE IN SURGERY\r\n\r\nBY J. MADISON TAYLOR, M.D., and J. H. GIBBON, M.D.,\r\n\r\n_Surgeon in Pennsylvania and Children’s Hospitals_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE DAWN OF THE CENTURY.—In the year 1579 the celebrated French\r\nsurgeon, Ambroise Paré, probably the greatest of his day, in completing\r\nhis work on “Chirurgery,” made the following statement, which to us of\r\nto-day is both amusing and pathetic. He says: “For God is my witness,\r\nand all good men know, that I have labored fifty years with all care\r\nand pains in the illustration and amplification of Chirurgery; and that\r\nI have so certainly touched the work whereat I aimed that antiquity\r\nmay seem to have nothing wherein it may exceed as beside the glory of\r\ninvention, nor posterity anything left but a certain small hope to add\r\nsome things.” This great man had scarcely passed away when the practice\r\nof surgery of his day was a thing of the past, due to the realization\r\nof that “certain small hope” which he allowed as possible to posterity.\r\nEvery reader, when he reflects upon the crude surgery practiced in\r\nthose days, when the operations were those of necessity and not\r\nelection,—that is, were done for injuries and not for disease, done to\r\nrelieve and not to cure; when he remembers that not only antiseptics\r\nbut also anæsthetics were unknown, must be filled with sympathy for\r\nthis old gentleman, and wonder what he would think _now_ were he to see\r\nwhat progress posterity has made and is still making.\r\n\r\nIt is not our purpose, however, to carry our researches so far back as\r\nParé’s time, but to begin with our own century and bring before the\r\nreader the advances in surgery since the day of our grandfathers.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of this century surgery was practiced by many great\r\nmen, men who did not enjoy the self-satisfaction of their predecessor,\r\nParé, but who accomplished much by constant endeavor and faithful\r\napplication to advance this art and science. They, too, realized\r\nmanifold “hopes,” and their children and grandchildren have moved\r\non, and to-day are still pressing forward in the line of invention\r\nand discovery. But to us, the art of an hundred years ago appears\r\nwidely different from that of our day. Anæsthesia had not then been\r\ndiscovered, no germ theory had been evolved, and, consequently, no\r\nsuch thing as antiseptic or aseptic surgery was known. The abdomen\r\nwas opened for disease only, and rarely; and brain surgery consisted\r\nsolely in trepanning for fractures of the skull. Surgery was not\r\nregarded as a specialty, but every surgeon was also an obstetrician\r\nand a practitioner of general medicine. Outside of the treatment of\r\nbroken bones, dislocations, gunshot wounds and injuries, the surgeon\r\nat that time operated for strangulated hernia, for stone in the\r\nbladder—“cutting for stone,” as it was called; for cataract and for\r\ncancer. Dentistry was just beginning to be taken up as a specialty,\r\nand all medical men extracted teeth, and many filled their cavities.\r\nOphthalmic surgery consisted largely in operations for cataract, and\r\nwas done by the general surgeon. One department of the surgeon’s\r\neducation at this time was well attended to, and that was his anatomic\r\nknowledge. Our bodies were the same then as now; and although the\r\nsurgeon dared not trespass in anatomical fields which are familiar\r\nground to the student of to-day, he did study the body after death, and\r\nwas quite as well informed regarding the gross anatomy of the human\r\nbody as the surgeon of to-day; and, had anæsthesia been known to him,\r\nhe would probably have accomplished nearly all that was done during the\r\nmiddle of the century by his successors.\r\n\r\nDuring the first quarter of the century no great advance was made in\r\nsurgery, that is, nothing revolutionizing; but many minds and hands\r\nwere at work perfecting old methods of operation and devising new\r\nones. They had to trust to whiskey and opium to control the pain of\r\nthe patient, and consequently operations requiring much time in their\r\nperformance were avoided when possible, and, when necessary, had to be\r\nperformed with such rapidity that the essential object aimed at was\r\noften missed. The patient was given a large dose of laudanum and a huge\r\ndrink of whiskey or brandy, and was then held or tied on the table\r\nwhile the surgeon proceeded with his work. One can readily understand\r\nthe torturing pain the poor patient had to endure, and the hurried and\r\noften unsatisfactory operation which the surgeon had to perform. The\r\nendurance of pain was not the worst part of the patient’s lot, for\r\nafterward he ran the greatest risk of blood-poisoning and gangrene,\r\nwhich were common complications in those days. It was the rarest thing\r\nfor even the simplest operation wounds to heal by “primary union,” as\r\nit was called,—that is, without the formation of pus. Every wounded\r\nsurface was expected to go through a certain amount of suppuration.\r\nMany patients lost their lives from compound fractures of their bones;\r\nand a compound fracture, that is, where there was a wound connecting\r\nthe seat of fracture with the skin, usually meant many months in bed,\r\nand very often the loss of the limb.\r\n\r\nExcepting for the purposes of removing a fœtus from the womb (the\r\nso-called Cæsarian operation, because Cæsar was from “his mother’s\r\nwomb untimely ripped”), the abdominal cavity was practically never\r\nopened, and when it was the patient nearly always died. The operation\r\nfor the radical cure of hernia was seldom resorted to, excepting when\r\nstrangulation of the intestine necessitated operative interference\r\nto save the patient’s life. During the latter part of the eighteenth\r\ncentury the quacks, calling themselves “rupture cutters,” were not\r\nscarce; but the great mortality of their practice produced a wholesome\r\nfear among the people. The operation was so often fatal that most\r\nof the best surgeons would only perform it under unusually urgent\r\ncircumstances. What caused the deaths was peritonitis, or gangrene of\r\nthe intestine, and not the method of operating; for at this time nearly\r\nevery method of operating had been devised that was in vogue fifty\r\nyears later.\r\n\r\nBone surgery, the treatment of fractures, dislocations, and diseases of\r\nthe bones, was greatly improved in the first half of the century, this\r\nsubject receiving more attention at the hands of surgical writers than\r\nany other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SURGICAL OPERATING ROOM, HOWARD HOSPITAL, PHILADELPHIA,\r\nPA.]\r\n\r\nANÆSTHESIA.—Anæsthesia may, certainly from the patient’s point of\r\nview, be looked upon as the greatest advancement ever made in surgery.\r\nIt was great not only for the reason that it gave the patient absolute\r\nunconsciousness during the time of the operation, but because it\r\nenabled the surgeon to work with greater exactness and less hurry.\r\nThe conception of the anæsthetic state did not, however, come into\r\nbeing for the first time in our century, for, like most great ideas,\r\nit agitated the minds of medical and scientific men for centuries.\r\nGross tells us that Theodoric, in the thirteenth century, recommended\r\nthe inhalation of a certain combination of opium, hemlock, and\r\nother vegetable derivatives for the purpose of producing sleep, and\r\nthat in India similar combinations were for centuries in use. It is\r\nneedless, however, to say that the effect produced was nothing like\r\nthat following the use of nitrous oxide, “laughing gas,” ether, or\r\nchloroform, and that their use never became general. Toward the close\r\nof the last century Sir Humphry Davy and others performed repeated\r\nexperiments with nitrous oxide gas, but finally gave up in despair.\r\nIn the early part of our own century several methods of producing\r\ninsensibility to pain were recommended, such as pressure on nerves and\r\nbleeding to the degree of producing unconsciousness, but none of them\r\nwas ever sufficiently successful to render their adoption general; and\r\nit remained for a New England dentist, Dr. Horace Wells, in 1844, to\r\nfirst use satisfactorily upon himself and his patients the complete\r\nstate of unconsciousness produced by nitrous oxide gas. This poor man,\r\nhowever, failed signally when he endeavored to demonstrate its powers\r\nbefore a body of medical men, and was subjected to the most unwarranted\r\nridicule. However, a pupil of this man, another dentist, named Morton,\r\ntwo years later, experimented with ether, and finally proved upon\r\nhimself and on patients the wonderful power of the vapor. He exhibited\r\nhis discovery at the Massachusetts General Hospital at Boston, where\r\nDr. Warren performed an operation upon a patient etherized by Dr.\r\nMorton. The fame of this man and his great discovery spread rapidly\r\nover the continent and into the Eastern Hemisphere, and in 1847 Sir\r\nJames Y. Simpson in Edinburgh discovered the anæsthetic powers of\r\nchloroform. These two agents, ether and chloroform, have existed as\r\nrivals for professional favor for nearly half a century, one being\r\nmore popular and more generally used in one country and the other in\r\nanother. There is, however, a field for the use of both, the operator\r\nchoosing the anæsthetic to suit the individual case. In our own country\r\nether is more generally used in the North and East and chloroform in\r\nthe South and West. Chloroform has had more deaths attributed to its\r\nuse, but in many cases is a much safer anæsthetic than ether. It is\r\nmost amusing to observe the attitude of the so-called conservative\r\nsurgeon toward the use of anæsthetics soon after their discovery;\r\nthis is particularly true of their employment in obstetric practice,\r\nmany eminent obstetricians maintaining that the parturient woman\r\nwas intended to suffer, and referring triumphantly to the Bible for\r\nauthority. It is, however, needless to say that although many men were\r\nat first uneasy in the use of these new-found agents, those who did\r\nnot take advantage of their wonderful powers found themselves rapidly\r\nbecoming out of date and deserted by their patients, who preferred\r\nunconsciousness to the older method of using opium and whiskey.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the great step made by the introduction of ether\r\nand chloroform, the medical man is to-day still dissatisfied and is\r\ncontinually endeavoring to discover some agent or combination of agents\r\nwhich will produce insensibility to pain without unconsciousness\r\nand without the slight danger and the uncomfortable after effects\r\nof chloroform and ether. An ideal anæsthetic then must be a local\r\nanæsthetic, one that will render the field of operation insensible and\r\nbe without the slightest danger to the patient.\r\n\r\nLOCAL ANÆSTHESIA.—At the beginning of our century freezing with ice\r\nalone, or with ice and salt, was the only method employed for producing\r\nlocal insensibility. Freezing as a local anæsthetic was, however, not\r\nextensively used until fifty years later, when Dr. Richardson of London\r\nshowed the anæsthetic effect of spraying the surface of the tissues\r\nwith ether. During the late sixties this method of freezing became\r\nquite popular for producing local anæsthesia for small operations such\r\nas extraction of teeth, removing nails, opening abscesses, etc., and\r\noccasionally was employed for more protracted operations, Cæsarian\r\nsection having been performed a number of times by the aid of this\r\nagent. The rhigolene spray was found later to be more satisfactory than\r\nether in many respects, and the two together were frequently used.\r\n\r\nAnother freezing agent which is now used very extensively and has\r\nentirely supplanted those just mentioned is the chloride of ethyl.\r\nThis, when applied to the dry skin, produces in a few seconds complete\r\nfreezing, and renders the surface comparatively painless for many of\r\nthe minor surgical operations.\r\n\r\nThe properties of cocaine as a local anæsthetic were known thirty years\r\nago, but it was not until 1884 that Dr. Kohler of Germany demonstrated\r\nits practical applicability. To-day most of the operations on the eye,\r\nnose, and throat are performed under the pain prevention afforded by\r\nthis drug, and in general surgery it has an extensive field, being\r\nfound satisfactory where freezing is inapplicable or general anæsthesia\r\nnot desired, as, for instance, in removing small tumors, splinters,\r\ningrowing nails, etc. In the eye, nose, and throat it is applied simply\r\nin solution to the mucous membrane, but where anæsthesia of the skin is\r\ndesired, it is necessary to inject it under the skin with a hypodermic\r\nsyringe. When used in strong solutions this remedy is dangerous, and\r\nit has lately been shown that weaker solutions when used in larger\r\nquantities are just as satisfactory and less dangerous.\r\n\r\nA recent substitute for cocaine is eucaine; but, although less\r\ndangerous, it is less satisfactory and not harmless to the tissues\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nANTISEPTIC AND ASEPTIC SURGERY.—Excepting the introduction of\r\nanæsthesia, no greater step has ever been made in surgery than that\r\nwhich was brought into use by the antiseptic and aseptic method of\r\ntreating wounds. It is now about thirty years since Sir Joseph Lister,\r\nbelieving in the so-called “germ theory,” evolved by Pasteur, Virchow,\r\nand others, advocated the use of agents which were destructive to germ\r\nlife in the treatment of wounds. At first the great antiseptic, and the\r\none used most generally by Lister, was carbolic acid, which was applied\r\nto the wound in solution, and used as a spray during the performance\r\nof operations, to protect the wound from infection by germs in the\r\natmosphere. It was not long, however, before it was discovered that the\r\ndanger lay not in the atmosphere but in the skin of the patient and\r\nin the hands of the surgeon and in the condition of his instruments\r\nand dressings; and to these sources attention was given with results\r\nknown to us all. Other antiseptics, such as bichloride of mercury and\r\nboric acid, afterward came into use, and within the past ten years the\r\nfirst of these two has largely supplanted carbolic acid, and is the one\r\nreliable and practical destroyer of germs. The antiseptic treatment\r\nof wounds was probably not in full swing until about 1885–1890, and\r\nwas quickly followed by the more recent aseptic method. These two can,\r\nhowever, never be successfully separate, as the latter is dependent\r\nentirely upon the former; that is, in order to render the field of\r\noperation and the hands of the surgeon aseptic, the antiseptics must\r\nbe used. Asepsis means without poisonous germs, and, as applied to\r\nsurgical treatment, it is essential that, after the instruments, the\r\ndressings, the patient’s skin, the surgeon’s and his assistants’ hands\r\nhave been thoroughly cleaned with soap and water and rendered free\r\nfrom germs, there be use of antiseptic solutions in the wound or on\r\nthe dressings. This has been a great step forward, this discovery that\r\nit was in the skin that the germs lurked, and that soap and water\r\nand a scrubbing brush were as necessary as antiseptics. Few surgeons\r\nto-day employ antiseptic solutions in wounds unless the wound itself is\r\nalready infected, when it becomes necessary. In wounds which are clean\r\nand made by the surgeon under aseptic conditions, no antiseptic drug\r\nis required which may indeed be actually harmful, for these chemicals\r\nwhich destroy germs are not altogether harmless to healthy tissue,\r\nparticularly when used in strong solution.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of anæsthesia and the promulgation of the germ theory\r\nof inflammation, together with the subsequent perfection of the means\r\nof destroying microbes, all within the memory of many now living,\r\nhave revolutionized surgery to such an extent that the surgeon\r\nreaches fearlessly into regions which before were impracticable, and\r\nundertakes operations which were never even dreamed of a generation\r\nago. One can readily imagine that no surgeon would care to undertake,\r\nand no patient would endure, the agony of an operation lasting for\r\nseveral hours without an anæsthetic; and that it must have been only\r\nan immediate and certain danger of death that compelled a surgeon, in\r\npre-antiseptic days, to open an abdomen or brain when he realized the\r\ngreat probability of subsequent inflammation and death.\r\n\r\nLet us look at some of the individual advances of surgery since the\r\nintroduction of anæsthesia and of the use of germ-destroying agents,\r\nconsidering first, simple fractures.\r\n\r\nOF SIMPLE FRACTURES.—Anæsthesia was the means of permitting surgeons\r\nto “set” fractures in a satisfactory manner and without pain; and the\r\nuse of antiseptics has prevented many of these fractures from becoming\r\ncompound fractures. Lately there has been a change in the general\r\ntreatment of fractures which is proving a great advancement. Formerly\r\nit was the custom to keep not only the broken bone itself perfectly\r\nquiet on a splint until union had taken place, but also to immobilize\r\nall the neighboring structures, joints, muscles, and tendons. This\r\nmeant that when the limb was taken off the splint, not only would the\r\nbone be “solid,” but there was also a tendency to fixation of the\r\nmuscles and joints, so that it took the patient as long to get back\r\nthe use of the limb as it did to unite the broken bone. This is now\r\nobviated in many fractures by beginning both the passive and active\r\nmotion of the neighboring muscles and joints at a much earlier period\r\nthan heretofore; in fact, in many fractures, such as those near the\r\nwrist, by never allowing these adjacent structures to get stiff at all,\r\nbut keeping up the passive motion (while the fragments are held firmly\r\ntogether) from the very first dressing. In other more complicated\r\nand serious fractures where motion is contra-indicated, the use of\r\ncarefully applied massage prevents largely the stiffness and the\r\nwasting of the muscles which results from long confinement on splints.\r\n\r\nCOMPOUND FRACTURES.—In pre-antiseptic days compound fractures were one\r\nof the greatest causes of the amputation of limbs; and yet, to-day,\r\nthese same breaks, which twenty-five years ago would have cost the\r\npatient his limb, are, by means of antiseptics, rendered aseptic and\r\nconverted into a simple fracture by the closing of the wound, and the\r\npart is not only saved but fully restored to function.\r\n\r\nBONE DISEASES.—Diseases of the bones, as inflammation, caries, and\r\nnecrosis, are now dealt with very differently from of old. The diseased\r\nstructures are now thoroughly removed; and the inflammation which at\r\none time kept the patient in misery and danger for a long time is\r\nsubdued from the start.\r\n\r\nOSTEOTOMY.—This term, which means the division of a bone, is generally\r\napplied to the correction of deformities, such as bow-legs. This\r\noperation fifty years ago was not frequently resorted to, and then\r\nonly in severe cases, the milder ones being left alone or treated with\r\nbraces, which at best could do little more than prevent increase in\r\ndeformity. When the operation was performed on the bone, it was then\r\ndivided, usually with a saw. The operation nowadays for this condition\r\nis what is called subcutaneous osteotomy; that is, the wound made is\r\nonly as large as the chisel used for severing the bone, about one\r\nhalf inch, and owing to our knowledge of microbes and our means of\r\ndestroying them and preventing their ravages, hundreds of legs are\r\nmade straight every year which a generation ago could not have been\r\nsafely touched.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLINICAL AMPHITHEATRE. GARRETT MEMORIAL BUILDING,\r\nPENNSYLVANIA HOSPITAL, PHILADELPHIA, PA.]\r\n\r\nAMPUTATIONS.—The first successful amputation at the hip joint, for\r\neither injury or disease, in the United States, was done in 1806 by\r\nDr. Brasheur; the next was not accomplished until 1824. As late as\r\n1882, the great American surgeon, Gross, wrote in his “System of\r\nSurgery:” “To no operation that can be performed on the human body is\r\nthe oft-repeated maxim, ‘_Ad extremos morbus extrema remedia_,’ more\r\njustly applicable than to amputation at the hip joint. The operation\r\nmay become necessary both on account of disease and accident; but\r\nit is of so formidable a nature and so fraught with danger, that it\r\nshould never be undertaken unless the patient has no other chance\r\nof escape. The great risk which attends it is chiefly due to shock,\r\nloss of blood, suppuration, erysipelas, and pyaemia.... Under highly\r\nfavorable circumstances, much of the enormous wound may unite by the\r\nfirst intention; but, in general, more or less suppuration takes place,\r\nand in some instances the discharge is so copious as to lead to fatal\r\nexhaustion. The greatest danger of all, however, is the occurrence of\r\npyaemia, or secondary abscess, especially in amputations at the hip\r\njoint in consequence of injury, as a compound fracture or a gunshot\r\nwound.” This gives the attitude of the profession toward this operation\r\na little more than fifteen years ago, and the dangers which attended\r\nits performance. Let us add that the mortality at this time may be\r\nexpressed in the following figures. (Dr. F. C. Sheppard prepared these\r\nstatistics for Dr. Ashhurst.) Of 613 cases in which the results are\r\nknown, “237 occurred in army practice, of which 30 recovered and 207,\r\nor 87.3 per cent died; 71 were performed in civil life for injury, with\r\nthe result of 47 deaths, or a mortality of 66.1 per cent; 261 were\r\npracticed for disease, with 105 deaths, or a mortality rate of 40.2 per\r\ncent; and of 44 amputations for unknown causes 34, or 77.2 per cent\r\nwere fatal.”\r\n\r\nIn 1890, Dr. John A. Wyeth of New York introduced his “bloodless\r\nmethod” of amputation at the hip joint, and he recently reports 69\r\noperations performed after this manner by himself and others, in which\r\nthere were 11 deaths, 5 of which occurred in cases of extreme injury,\r\nwhere the patients had lost a large amount of blood and vigor before\r\noperation. In 40 cases the operation was done for malignant growth,\r\nand 4 deaths occurred, 10 per cent. In 22 the amputation was made\r\nfor inflammatory disease of the bone, and 3 died, 13.6 per cent. One\r\nhas but to contrast these statistics to understand what antiseptic\r\nmethods and recent improvements in the control of hemorrhage have done\r\nto lessen the mortality of amputations. The still more recent use of\r\nsalt solution injected into the circulation of patients suffering from\r\nprofuse hemorrhage has lately been the means of saving many lives\r\nwhich would have otherwise succumbed to the loss of blood and the\r\nshock subsequent to injury and operation. As illustrating the contrast\r\nbetween the septic and antiseptic methods, let us consider the surgery\r\nof our Civil War and compare with that of to-day, and we shall see the\r\nenormous differences in methods, and particularly in economy of limbs\r\nand organs as well as mortality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PENNSYLVANIA HOSPITAL, PHILADELPHIA.]\r\n\r\nHEMORRHAGE.—The arrest and control of hemorrhage has greatly improved\r\nwithin the past twenty-five years. The making of an aseptic wound\r\ndoes away largely with the much dreaded secondary hemorrhage of a\r\ngeneration ago, by preventing suppuration, which is usually the\r\ncause of secondary hemorrhage. The clumsy and complicated apparatus\r\nof former days for controlling hemorrhage has been superseded by the\r\nuse of the Esmarch rubber tourniquet, the neat hemostatic forceps,\r\nand the sterile animal ligature. No surgeon thinks to-day of applying\r\na silk ligature to a blood vessel and allowing it to hang out of the\r\nwound until it separates, so that in case of secondary bleeding he\r\ncould readily find the vessel; but he applies an absorbable ligature,\r\nusually of catgut, which is sterile, and which is entirely absorbed by\r\nthe tissues after it has done its work. Much suffering has been saved\r\npatients by the introduction of absorbable materials for ligation of\r\nvessels and sewing of wounds. Formerly one of the great dreads of\r\nwounds was the “taking out of the stitches.” To-day where the wounds\r\nare not inflamed this is little complained of, and where the animal\r\nsuture is used there is no discomfort whatever. Many means have, during\r\nthe past century, been employed for the resuscitation of patients\r\nsuffering from profuse hemorrhage and shock. The idea of injecting\r\ninto the veins of the patient thus affected blood from another person\r\nor from an animal is not new, and has at times been quite successful.\r\nThe most generally used method was to draw the blood from a healthy\r\nperson or animal and inject it into the vein of the patient with a\r\nsyringe: however, so-called “direct transfusion” was also employed,\r\nand consisted in pumping the blood direct from the vein of the healthy\r\nindividual into that of the patient. Other materials than blood have\r\nbeen injected into the blood vessels of persons suffering from great\r\nloss of blood, notably milk. All of these methods have been put upon\r\nthe shelf, never to be called into use again. The ingenuity of the\r\nnineteenth century suggested the substitution of a solution of common\r\nsalt for blood and, to-day, the intra-venous injection of normal salt\r\nsolution saves hundreds of lives. The solution is made to resemble\r\nas closely as possible the liquid portion of the human blood (the\r\n_liquor sanguinis_), especially as to specific gravity; and as it is\r\nalways sterilized by boiling before being used, it is free from all\r\nthe dangers which accompany the transfusion of one person’s blood into\r\nanother. No well-appointed operating room is without its transfusion\r\napparatus and its salt solution ready for use.\r\n\r\nWOUNDS.—Reference to the remarks on asepsis and antisepsis will show\r\nthe reader that the treatment of wounds has undergone a complete change\r\nin the past quarter of a century; but probably the modern treatment of\r\ngunshot wounds illustrates this better than anything else. Until 1885,\r\nonly six cases were recorded where the abdominal cavity was opened\r\nfor gunshot wounds, but since that time hundreds of cases have been\r\ntreated in this way every year. The injuries were formerly considered\r\nalmost certainly fatal, and if the intestine was injured the patient\r\nassuredly died. Now the abdomen is opened, hemorrhage controlled,\r\nwounds—often to the number of six or eight or even thirty or more—of\r\nthe intestines closed, or an injured section of the intestines removed\r\nand the abdominal cavity cleansed and closed, with many favorable\r\nterminations to make the operation not only a justifiable one, but one\r\nof necessity and safety. There is no comparison with the present-day\r\nresults of gunshot wounds of either abdomen or chest and those of a\r\ngeneration ago. It is the duty of the surgeon, in case of gunshot wound\r\nof abdomen, to open, explore, and repair, whereas formerly it was\r\nconsidered the part of wisdom to leave the patient without radical\r\ntreatment and only to make him comfortable with opiates. Thus cases\r\nof damage to the intestines and viscera did occasionally recover in\r\npre-antiseptic days, but it was the rarest occurrence.\r\n\r\nWhat has been said of gunshot wounds applies also to stab wounds of the\r\nchest and abdomen.\r\n\r\nTHE ALIMENTARY CANAL.—Probably the surgery of no portion of the body,\r\nunless it be the brain, has been so much improved during the past\r\nfifteen years as that of the alimentary canal. The esophagus or gullet\r\nis now opened with impunity for both disease and injury. This organ is\r\nnot only approachable through the neck but also through the back part\r\nof the chest, by resection of the ribs; and the latter operation is\r\nfrequently made necessary by the lodgment of foreign bodies,—buttons,\r\nfalse teeth, etc.—so low down in the esophagus that they cannot be\r\nreached through the mouth or through an opening made in the neck.\r\n\r\nTHE STOMACH.—This organ, which was formerly a forbidden field to the\r\nsurgeon, is now subjected to the most varied surgical operations,\r\nfrom simple opening for the purpose of removing a foreign body or\r\nestablishing a fistulous tract to the resection of a portion of it\r\nor to its complete resection, as has been successfully accomplished\r\nseveral times within the past year or two for malignant disease. The\r\nremoval of the smaller end of the stomach for cancer is now a frequent\r\noperation. During the war of the rebellion there were sixty-four cases\r\nof wounds of the stomach, and only one recovered. In over six hundred\r\nand fifty cases of wounds of the intestines there were recorded only\r\nfive cases of recovery from wounds of the small and fifty-nine from\r\nwounds of the large intestine.\r\n\r\nTHE INTESTINAL TRACT.—What has been said of the stomach applies also\r\nto this portion of the alimentary canal. No surgeon can nowadays call\r\nhimself such if he is incapable of removing a diseased portion of\r\nintestine, it may be only a few inches or several feet, and bringing\r\nthe dividing ends of remaining intestine into such apposition that\r\nhealing takes place and the function is restored. Until recently, when\r\nthe means of anastomosing the intestinal canal were perfected, it was\r\nthe custom of the surgeon to bring the severed ends of the intestines\r\ninto the abdominal incision and suture them there, establishing in this\r\nway an artificial anus with all its accompanying discomforts. This was\r\ncertainly better than allowing the patient to perish from his disease,\r\nbut how infinitely preferable is the present method of bringing the\r\nhealthy cut ends of the intestine into apposition and reëstablishing\r\nthe calibre. It is this operation which has so much reduced the\r\nmortality of intra-abdominal injuries, gunshot wounds, stabs, etc., and\r\nhas made hundreds of sufferers from intestinal cancer either well again\r\nor comfortable for years. The perfection of the operation of joining\r\none part of the alimentary canal to another has been due largely to the\r\ningenuity and perseverance of American surgeons, who have devoted years\r\nto experimentation and practice upon the cadaver and upon animals.\r\n\r\nTHE KIDNEYS.—The kidney has not been behind the other organs of the\r\nbody in reaping the benefits of modern surgery. The first case of\r\nremoval of the kidney was done in 1869 by Simon, and was successful. It\r\nwas done only after a number of dogs were operated on successfully to\r\ndemonstrate that life and health are compatible with only one kidney.\r\nSince this time the removal of a kidney for disease or injury, when its\r\nfellow of the opposite side is healthy and performing its function, has\r\nbeen looked upon as an entirely justifiable operation. The surgery of\r\nthis organ has lately so far advanced, however, that many kidneys are\r\nnow treated by more curative operations. In 1880 the first operation\r\nwas done for the removal of a stone from the kidney, an operation\r\nwhich now nearly every surgeon of much experience has performed. The\r\noperation for the fixation of a floating kidney, which is now so\r\ncommon, was first done in 1881. Now, since Simon’s bold experiment the\r\nlives of between two thousand and three thousand persons have been thus\r\nsaved who had otherwise certainly died.\r\n\r\nTHE BLADDER.—For generations the bladder has been considered a\r\nlegitimate field for surgery, but modern methods and technique have\r\ngreatly extended the domain. One of the greatest advances in bladder\r\nsurgery has been the crushing of stone and its immediate removal.\r\nUntil 1825 the treatment of all stones in the bladder was their\r\nremoval through an incision made in the organ. At that time Civiale\r\nfirst performed the operation of passing a bladed instrument into the\r\nbladder and crushing the stone, then allowing the patient to pass it\r\nsubsequently at urination. The operation became quite popular with\r\ncertain surgeons as early as the middle of the century. The cutting\r\noperation has, however, never been entirely put aside, and even to-day\r\nit is, in many cases, the best and only procedure. In 1878 Bigelow, of\r\nBoston, devised the method which is now universally used, of crushing\r\nthe stone and washing it out at once through a silver tube. This was a\r\ngreat stride ahead of the old method.\r\n\r\nOne of the great difficulties in deciding upon the removal of a kidney\r\nhas been the trouble of finding out whether the other kidney is doing\r\nits work, and this Kelly, of Johns Hopkins University, has done much to\r\novercome in devising his method of examining by looking at the openings\r\nof the tubes of the kidneys where they empty into the bladder. If the\r\nkidney is performing its function the urine will be seen flowing from\r\nits tube into the bladder.\r\n\r\nHERNIA OR RUPTURE.—Probably the treatment of no condition has received\r\nmore consideration from the surgeon of the nineteenth century than that\r\nof rupture, and it was not until 1891 that an operation was devised,\r\nsimultaneously by an Italian and an American surgeon, which has proved\r\nfor itself all that its originators claimed. Hundreds of operative\r\nmethods have been brought forward for the cure of this troublesome and\r\ndangerous condition; but, until the operations of Halstead and Bossini\r\nwere brought forward, little prospect of an absolute cure could be\r\npromised a patient, and the conservative surgeon would only undertake\r\nto operate upon very troublesome cases such as could not be controlled\r\nby a truss. Now nearly every case of hernia may be looked upon as\r\ncurable by an operation.\r\n\r\nOPERATIVE GYNÆCOLOGY.—The operative treatment of the disease of the\r\nfemale generative organs has been revolutionized in our century,\r\nand its revolution has been largely due to American surgeons. The\r\nfirst ovariotomy ever performed was done in Kentucky, by Dr. Ephraim\r\nMcDowell, in 1809. In the fifties, Marion Sims won great renown for\r\nhimself and his country by his wonderful ingenuity and boldness in\r\nthis line of work. The greatest advance here, as in all departments\r\nof surgery, has been made since the introduction of antiseptic and\r\naseptic principles. To-day there is no disease or condition which, if\r\nseen early enough, cannot be cured, or essentially relieved at the\r\nhands of an expert abdominal surgeon. Thousands of women are now saved\r\nevery year by these means who formerly would have certainly died or\r\nremained hopeless invalids.\r\n\r\nAPPENDICITIS.—This condition must seem to the ordinary reader to be\r\neither a new disease or one much more prevalent than in days gone by,\r\nbut it is not the case. The cause of this appearance is the fact that\r\nin former times the condition was not recognized in its incipiency, and\r\nthe exact cause of the trouble was unknown. The condition then advanced\r\nuntil it was called typhlitis, peritonitis, and obstruction of the\r\nbowels, etc., all of which would to-day occur if the conditions were\r\nnot recognized early and treatment immediately instituted before the\r\ninflammation and infection extended from the appendix to neighboring\r\ntissues.\r\n\r\nBRAIN SURGERY.—This branch of surgery is practically a triumph of\r\nrecent years. Formerly the brain was never interfered with except\r\nfor injury (traumatic), and even then nothing was done excepting for\r\nthe removal of pressure, as from a piece of depressed bone, and the\r\ninstitution of drainage. To-day the skull is opened for epilepsy;\r\nabscesses of the brain are opened and drained successfully, and tumors\r\nof the brain are removed, thus not only in numberless instances saving\r\nlife but—what is equally important—saving the usefulness of the\r\nlife and mind. The first actual successes in this line are recorded\r\nby Bennett and Godlee in 1884, who localized and operated on and\r\nultimately found a tumor. The patient died, but the bold beginning\r\nwas followed by a number of other surgeons, till this new region for\r\nexploration, hitherto untouched, has become a fertile ground for\r\nsuccessful efforts. Abscess of the brain, until twenty years ago, was\r\nalmost invariably fatal. MacEwen in 1879 located an abscess of the\r\nbrain and begged to be allowed to operate, but was refused by the\r\nfamily of the patient. After the death of the patient he operated\r\nprecisely as he would have done in life, evacuated the pus and\r\ndemonstrated that had he been permitted to do so he could have saved\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nWhere the cranium is wounded surgeons nowadays will not hesitate to\r\nopen the skull, secure the bleeding vessels, remove clots, and thus\r\nmany lives are saved. Even comparatively slight injuries to the skull,\r\nwhere the brain is damaged, involve oftentimes destruction to the\r\narteries and blood is effused, producing such destructive pressure\r\nas causes very serious symptoms or even death. In other instances,\r\nthe results of a blow or a fall without injuring the skull may cause\r\nprofound damage and subsequent hemorrhage. In all these cases operative\r\ninterference, now extremely safe and easy, may readily save life.\r\nGunshot wounds of the brain are now only occasionally fatal, provided\r\nopportunity offers for prompt and clean operative work. Even where the\r\nball has traversed the entire length of the cerebrum, recovery has\r\nfollowed operation. The results of brain surgery in relieving certain\r\nforms of epilepsy are occasionally most brilliant and frequently much\r\nrelief is afforded. Where the epilepsy is of the character known as\r\nfocal, and where there is evidence of irritation of the brain, due to\r\na local pressure, whether of the cranial walls or of some new growth\r\nwithin the brain tissue, the removal of these sources of irritation\r\nhas in many reported instances been most satisfactory. Again,\r\ncertain cases of protracted headache, so severe as to render life\r\ninsupportable, have been cured by trepanning the skull. Certain forms\r\nof insanity have been modified and relieved where this had followed\r\nupon brain injuries. It is of great interest to reflect upon the\r\nmethods by which students of brain disease are enabled to determine so\r\nexactly the location of tumors, abscesses, hemorrhages, clots, scars,\r\nand other alterations of tissue giving rise to epilepsy and brain\r\ndisorders, and which afford no indication of the diseased locality\r\nby any changed condition of the surface. In dealing with other parts\r\nof the body, if the precise locality of the part to be operated on\r\ncannot be at first determined, there is no hesitation in the minds of\r\nthe surgeons in cutting down upon, and searching for, that which he\r\nproposes to remove. In dealing with so delicate an organ as the brain,\r\nhowever, this cannot be permitted; for a variation of the very smallest\r\ndimension will sometimes change the manipulations from those of perfect\r\nsafety to the most fatal results. Our knowledge of the location of\r\nthe functions of the brain and the areas from whence arise governing\r\ninfluences has been derived almost solely from experiments upon living\r\nanimals. Among the names of the great pioneers in this direction must\r\nbe mentioned those of Ferrier and Horseley, of England; Fritsch,\r\nHitzig, and Goltz, of Germany. The researches which have thus opened\r\nup a new realm of operative possibility are among the very greatest\r\ntriumphs in our means of saving life and affording opportunity for\r\nrelief of the most serious disablements known to modern times.\r\n\r\nFor illustration of how these studies are pursued, it may be of\r\ninterest to review the method used by Horseley.\r\n\r\nThe brain of a monkey having been exposed at the part to be\r\ninvestigated, the poles of a battery are applied over squares one\r\ntwelfth of an inch in diameter, and all the various movements which\r\noccur (if any) are minutely studied. One square having been studied,\r\nthe next is stimulated, and the results are again noted, and so on from\r\nsquare to square. These movements are then tabulated. For example, all\r\nthose adjacent squares which, when stimulated, produce movements of\r\nthe thumb are called the region for representation of the thumb, or\r\n“the thumb centre;” and to all those squares which produce movements\r\nof the hand, the elbow, the shoulder, or the face, etc., are given\r\ncorresponding names. In this way the brain has been mapped out, region\r\nby region, and the same minute, patient study given to each.\r\n\r\nThese animals are etherized so that they do not suffer the least pain.\r\nSuch operations, with few exceptions, even without ether, are not\r\npainful. The brain itself can be handled, compressed, cut, or torn\r\nwithout the least pain. A number of cases have already been reported\r\nin which a considerable portion of the human brain has been removed by\r\noperation, and the patients have been about their ordinary avocations\r\nwithin a week or two.\r\n\r\nStudying in this way the brain in the lower animals, it is now possible\r\nto get a very fair knowledge of the localization of many of its\r\nfunctions in man.\r\n\r\nMoreover, portions of the body can be entirely severed, and, if\r\nsuitably preserved, can be replaced, and they will adhere and grow as\r\nif nothing had happened. When a wound is slow in healing, we now take\r\nbits of skin, either from the patient’s own body or provided by the\r\nwilling family or friends, or even from frogs, and “graft” them on the\r\nsurface of the wound. They usually adhere, and as enlargement takes\r\nplace at their margins, they coalesce by one half the time required for\r\nhealing. Even a large disk of bone, one or two inches in diameter, when\r\nremoved from the skull, can be so saved and utilized. It is placed in\r\na vessel filled with a warm antiseptic solution, which is again placed\r\nin a basin of warm water, and it is the duty of a special assistant to\r\nsee that the thermometer in this basin shall always mark 100° to 105°\r\nFahr. The bone may be separated from the skull so long as one or two\r\nhours, but if properly cared for can be replaced, and will grow fast\r\nand fulfill its accustomed but interrupted duty of protecting the brain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: X-RAY PICTURE OF A COMPOUND FRACTURE AND DISLOCATION OF\r\nTHE FOREARM.]\r\n\r\nRÖNTGEN RAYS.—One of the most recent advances in the art of surgery\r\nis the discovery and use of the X-rays. In December, 1895, Professor\r\nRöntgen, of Würzburg, announced his discovery, and since then its\r\nutility has continually increased, until to-day no large hospital or\r\nproperly equipped teaching institution, indeed no first-rate surgeon,\r\nis without the X-ray apparatus. By its use many doubtful cases of both\r\ninjury and disease in surgical practice are thus entirely rendered\r\nclear. In the diagnosis and treatment of many fractures it is nearly\r\nindispensable, showing the exact location of the break and the position\r\nof the fragment before and after dressing. Probably in no other\r\ncondition, unless it be in fractured bones, has the X-ray proved itself\r\nof so much value as in the location of foreign bodies lodged in any of\r\nthe organs or tissues of the body. Before Professor Röntgen’s discovery\r\nit was not of infrequent occurrence that an exploratory operation was\r\nnecessary to positively prove the presence of a foreign body, and even\r\nthis was at times of necessity a failure. To-day the X-ray picture\r\nenables the surgeon to learn the exact location of the foreign body and\r\nindicates to him the best point from which it may be attacked. With\r\nrepeated improvements in apparatus the time of exposure required for\r\nmaking the picture of the part has been greatly reduced. The advantage\r\nof this was made manifest when it was discovered that destruction of\r\nthe skin, the so-called “X-ray burns,” might follow long and repeated\r\nexposure to the rays. It is not always necessary to make a plate of\r\nthe part to be examined, since by simply studying the parts by the\r\neyes through the fluoroscope or the fluoroscopic screen the surgeon\r\ncan readily see everything that a photographic picture could show him.\r\nThe fluoroscope or screen is now often used during the operation of\r\nremoving foreign bodies; through it the surgeon can watch the various\r\nsteps of his operation, his approach to the foreign body and its final\r\nremoval.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: X-RAY PICTURE OF A DISLOCATED ELBOW.]\r\n\r\nIf the field of its usefulness continues to expand at its present rate,\r\nit will not be long before its use as a diagnostic measure will be as\r\nvaluable to the medical man as it now is to the surgeon.\r\n\r\nBy such instruments of precision as this, and others less conspicuous,\r\nthe old elements of intelligent inference and argument by analogy and\r\nexclusion are rendered of less value, and a rapid approach is made to\r\nscientific exactitude in surgery as well as medicine. All this has\r\nattained a far higher quality and scope in the last quarter of this\r\ncentury than in any other period of the world’s history, and we may\r\nlook to great advances in the coming century, in all life-conserving\r\nand remedial measures whereby the race may enjoy a larger measure\r\nof relief as well as immunity from the onslaught of disease and the\r\nresults of accident.\r\n\r\nThere is shown here for illustration a photographic picture of a\r\nlimb, taken by the X-ray now growing familiar to every one. It should\r\nbe borne in mind that while it is a simple matter for the casual\r\nobserver to note obvious solutions of continuity in bones, or the\r\npresence of foreign bodies, this is not the chief item of usefulness\r\nto the surgeon, and certainly not to the medical practitioner. A\r\nspecial training is required to study and interpret the findings and\r\nappearances of the tissues, their altered relationships, densities,\r\nand many other matters entirely insignificant to the uneducated among\r\nmedical men or laity.\r\n\r\nAgain, the picture here shown is similar in outline to but a reversal\r\nof the shading seen through the fluoroscope by direct vision, when the\r\ngreatest skill is required in noting the significance of altered states\r\nin the denser or softer tissues.\r\n\r\nWhen suits for malpractice are instituted against surgeons it is not to\r\nbe admitted that the evidence or findings of the “highly intelligent”\r\nbut not technically skilled witness can have the slightest weight as\r\nproving the condition of tissues of which they are very ignorant, not\r\nonly physiologically but more so pathologically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGRESS OF MEDICINE\r\n\r\nBY FRANK C. HAMMOND, M.D.,\r\n\r\n_Instructor in Gynecology, Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia_.\r\n\r\n\r\n“As a point of history pregnant with valuable deductions, it is good\r\nto look back upon the conditions of medicine in former times and find\r\nthat it has always kept pace with the progress of the physical and\r\nmoral sciences. Where these, however, have been marked by folly and\r\ncredulity, medicine has exhibited the same imperfections.”\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to trace the improvement in successive eras, because\r\nthey melt into one another by indefinable gradations. During the\r\nearliest period it was believed that physic was an art which was\r\nsupposed to be most mysterious, and it was presumed that the practicers\r\nheld communion with the world of spirits. The practice of medicine in\r\nthose days consisted in the usage of agents necessarily unreliable, as,\r\nfor instance, the word abracadabra hung around the neck as an amulet to\r\nchase away the ague, etc.\r\n\r\nMuch time has been wasted in attempting to portray the first origin\r\nof medicine. Bambilla, a surgeon of Vienna, has asserted that Tubal\r\nCain was the inventor of cauterizing instruments, apparatus for\r\nreducing fractures, and other instruments for surgical procedures, thus\r\nendeavoring to prove that surgery antedated medicine. It is evident\r\nthat medicine must have had a very early origin, for mankind even in\r\nthe earliest ages suffered pain and the train of sequences due to\r\nexposure, and hence soon discovered a method of alleviation. Their\r\ncategory probably consisted of herbs. Unacquainted, however, with the\r\nconstruction and function of the human economy, practitioners were\r\nunable to trace the progress of disease, and the more fatal internal\r\nmaladies were ascribed to the deities whom they feared. Hence, various\r\nsuperstitious practices would arise and be handed down from one\r\ngeneration to another. We may imagine this to have been the origin of\r\nthe healing art, and such is nearly its present condition amongst the\r\nsavages of Africa, Australasia, Polynesia, Sumatra, etc.\r\n\r\nLater on, the priests became the physicians, from being the oracles of\r\nthe divinity whom the people wished to consult. The various remedies\r\nwere handed down from one to another, as medical science did not\r\nexist at that time. Herodotus informs us that even in his time the\r\nBabylonians, Chaldeans, and other nations had no physicians. When any\r\none was attacked with disease the patient was carried into the public\r\nstreet, and passers-by who had suffered from a similar affection, or\r\nnursed one who had, advised the sufferer to employ the measures that\r\nproved successful in former cases.\r\n\r\nThe earliest writers on medicine trace its origin, in common with\r\nthat of most other branches of knowledge, to the Egyptians. They\r\nappear to be the first nation that cultivated medicine and furthered\r\nits progress. Many peculiar medical properties were attributed to\r\nthe deities. All diseases were supposed to originate from the anger\r\nof Isis. Resin was burned in the morning, myrrh at noon, and a\r\ncomposition termed cyphy in the evening, in the temples of Isis, and\r\nthe sick were taken there to sleep, during which the oracles might\r\nreveal to them the means which they should employ to effect a cure.\r\nThis is an illustration of the superstitions which prevailed at that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe earliest authentic records which we can ascertain from collateral\r\nreading are to be found in the Scriptures. Here it is stated that\r\nJoseph commanded his servants and physicians to embalm him (1700\r\nB. C.). This shows that Egypt at that time possessed a set of men who\r\npracticed the healing art, and that they embalmed the dead. This must\r\nhave required an idea of anatomy, which, needless to say, was crude\r\nand unscientific, as dissection of the human body at that time was\r\nprohibited, the penalty being death.\r\n\r\nAccording to Pliny, the Egyptian kings encouraged post-mortems, for\r\nthe purpose of ascertaining the cause of diseases; and this method was\r\nfostered by the Ptolemies, during whose reigns anatomy was raised to a\r\nhigher standard.\r\n\r\nThrough the writings of Moses in the sacred Scriptures, we learn that\r\nthe medicine of the Hebrews appertained mostly to public hygiene. Meat\r\nof the hog and rabbit was forbidden, as being injurious in the Egyptian\r\nand Indian climate. The relation of man and wife and the purification\r\nof women were regulated. The measures suggested by Moses for the\r\nprevention of the spread of leprosy have not yet been surpassed. Next\r\nto Moses, Solomon acquired quite an efficient knowledge of compounding\r\nremedies.\r\n\r\nThe Indian races were divided into castes, the priests alone enjoying\r\nthe privilege of practicing medicine. Their medical knowledge was\r\ncondensed in a book which they called _Vagadasastir_. They believed\r\nthe body gave rise, through seventeen thousand vessels, to ten species\r\nof gas which conflicted and engendered disease. So far as we know,\r\nthey were the first to record a way of testing the specific gravity of\r\nurine. Though accused of many absurdities, they claimed to cure the\r\nbites of venomous snakes and compounded an ointment which eradicated\r\nthe cicatrices of smallpox,—a result which has not as yet been\r\nattained in the present epoch. The Chinese attribute the invention of\r\nmedicine to Hoâm-ti, one of their emperors, who lived about 2687 B. C.;\r\nbut possessing no anatomical knowledge, their surgery, to say the\r\nleast, was barbarous. For over four thousand years the Chinese were not\r\nallowed to communicate with foreigners, and naturally their progress\r\nwas at a standstill. They used cups, acupuncture, fomentations,\r\nlotions, plasters, baths, etc. Their midwifery practice consisted\r\nmainly of murderous principles, and it is only since the introduction\r\nof missionaries that a reformation in the medical practice of the\r\nChinese empire has been accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe condition of medicine in Greece did not differ from that of the\r\n“rude and uncivilized nations.” But later, Greek physicians are\r\ncredited with the most brilliant discoveries. The most distinguished\r\nof Chiron’s pupils was Æsculapius, who occupies the most conspicuous\r\nplace in the history of medicine. Æsculapius is always painted with\r\na staff, because the sick have need of a support; and the serpent\r\nentwined around it is the symbol of wisdom. The sons of Æsculapius\r\nare considered the fathers of surgery, and, for their distinguished\r\nvalor at the siege of Troy, have been classed by Homer among the Greek\r\nheroes.\r\n\r\nThe first operation of venesection, or blood-letting, formerly so\r\npromiscuously done, with at times good, but oftener disastrous,\r\nresults, and now rarely resorted to, is attributed to Podalirius, of\r\nrecognized Grecian medical skill, the patient being a princess.\r\n\r\nThe early Greeks above all recognized the value of physical culture,\r\nwhich to-day occupies a prominent place in our curriculum. Were the\r\nchildren of to-day, like those of the ancient Greeks, compelled to\r\nfollow a routine of physical training, a rugged constitution would\r\nreplace many a “delicate” and “infirm” one, and the race propagated\r\nwould tend to develop a stronger character. Then the weak-minded,\r\nnow so conspicuously present, would be eradicated, and many diseased\r\nconditions fostered by an “inanimate” race would disappear.\r\n\r\nHygeia, from whence comes Hygiene, or the art of preserving health, was\r\na pretended sister of Æsculapius. Anatomy could not flourish in Greece,\r\nbecause a most exemplary punishment awaited any untoward conduct toward\r\nthe dead. Their peculiar religious beliefs regarding the rest of the\r\nsoul were responsible for this.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of the functions of the body in health and disease was\r\nappreciated by Pythagoras. Diogenes asserts that Alcmæon, one of\r\nthe Pythagoreans, wrote a work on the functions, which work would\r\nconsequently be the most ancient known treatise on physiology.\r\n\r\nThe age of Hippocrates (B. C. 460–370) was marked by a revolution in\r\nmedical science. “This central figure in the history of medicine”\r\nwas descendant of a family in which the practice of medicine\r\nwas hereditary. He was an extensive writer on such subjects as\r\nepidemics, acute diseases, dislocations, fractures, etc. Owing to\r\nthe impossibility of establishing a physiology without an anatomical\r\nbasis, his references to these subjects are crude and incorrect.\r\nTo Hippocrates we owe the classification of endemic, sporadic, and\r\nepidemic forms of disease, and their division into acute and chronic.\r\nHe wrote on diseases of women and epilepsy, and his therapeutics,\r\nthough crude, were a marked improvement on what had preceded. He wrote\r\nfully on external diseases and surgical therapeutics. In obstetrics he\r\nwas a close observer and a thoughtful teacher. The brilliant theories\r\nand practices so diligently observed and urged by this master were\r\nthrown in the shadow by his thoughtless followers. The well-instructed\r\nphysician is not ignorant of the opinions of Hippocrates, for truly\r\nthe “divine old man” is the “Father of Physic.” He caused a revolution\r\nin the practice of medicine, semeiology, pathology, and dietetics. He\r\ntaught physicians to observe attentively the progress of Nature, proved\r\nthe inutility of theories, and showed that observation is the basis of\r\nmedicine.\r\n\r\nAn important age, and one of marked progress in medicine, is from the\r\nfoundation of the Alexandrian Library (320 B. C.) up to the death of\r\nGalen (A. D. 200). Under the Ptolemies dissection of human bodies was\r\nallowed, and hence, as already stated, the science of medicine received\r\nquite an impulse. Herophilus deserves first mention as a dissector. He\r\ndescribed the brain and its vessels, the eye, the intestinal canal, and\r\nparts of the vascular system. The valves of the heart were more exactly\r\ndescribed by Erasistratus, who discovered the lymph vessels and pointed\r\nout that the epiglottis prevents the entrance of food into the lungs.\r\n\r\nAretæus, more than any other up to his time, attempted to found\r\npathology upon a sound anatomic basis, an effort which shows the\r\nscientific progress of his age.\r\n\r\nOf all the physicians of antiquity, Galen was probably the most\r\nbrilliant genius. In the midst of disorder he led back to the safer\r\nroad of sound doctrine and accurate observation which distinguished\r\nthe Hippocratic school. He wrote extensively on anatomy, especially\r\nregarding the muscles. He was the first vivisector, by exposing\r\nthe muscles of animals and demonstrating their functions, and his\r\nclassification according to their use is at present in vogue. Carefully\r\nregulated vivisection has been, and always will be, of incalculable\r\nbenefit to the development of accurate medical knowledge, and an\r\nindirect aid in the alleviation of human suffering. Galen divided the\r\nbody into cranial and thoracic cavities, and described the organs,\r\netc., contained therein. Anatomy and physiology, the fundamental bases\r\nof medicine and surgery, made the most progress during the period just\r\nreviewed, and next came the description of diseases, their medical and\r\nsurgical therapeutics.\r\n\r\nAfter the sixth century medicine was exercised almost exclusively by\r\nthe monks of the West. They were unworthy the name of physicians, as\r\nthey resorted more to prayers, and were retarded by ignorance and\r\nprejudice.\r\n\r\nDuring the seventh and eighth centuries there were among the monks a\r\nfew traditionary remains of science, originating from the East. The\r\nprelates, archdeacons, etc., though continuing the practice of the\r\nhealing art, were gradually discouraged by the church, but as late\r\nas the middle of the fifteenth century the Bishop of Colchester was\r\nchaplain and first physician to Henry VI. In 1452 physicians of the\r\nUniversity of Paris were not allowed to marry, the applicant, prior to\r\nadmission, taking the oath of celibacy.\r\n\r\nDuring the twelfth century the school of Salernum, through the personal\r\ninterest manifested by Emperor Frederick II., acquired a degree of\r\nreputation attained by few similar institutions in ancient times.\r\nSchools in Paris and England were placed on an advanced standing,\r\nthe professors being salaried; and about this period the titles of\r\nbachelor, licentiate, and master, were granted to the physicians.\r\n\r\nDuring the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries medicine made remarkable\r\nprogress in France under St. Louis. During the reign of this prince the\r\nteaching of medicine and surgery was divided into separate and distinct\r\nclasses. Medical institutions now became greatly encouraged, and in the\r\nleading cities of Europe universities were erected under the auspices\r\nof royalty.\r\n\r\nMedical instruction experienced an important revolution in the European\r\ncountries during the fourteenth century. For the first time in Europe\r\nanatomy was taught by dissection of the human body. Guy de Chauliac,\r\nwho lived at the end of this century, wrote a treatise on surgery which\r\nserved as the basis of European instruction until Ambroise Paré of\r\nFrance published his celebrated work upon the same subject.\r\n\r\nThe fifteenth century was also one of improvement. The Arabs added\r\na few observations on pathology, especially of the eruptive fevers.\r\nSome useful works on pharmacy and materia medica were published during\r\nthis epoch. During this era the operation was devised for replacing\r\nthe nose when removed by accident or disease, by using for the purpose\r\na piece of flesh taken from the arm, and applying it by a grafting\r\nprocess. About the middle of this period the internal administration of\r\nmetallic drugs was introduced. Towards the latter end, the invention of\r\nprinting tended to assist the progress of medicine. Near the close of\r\nthis century scurvy was first noticed in Germany. During this period\r\nmore energy was devoted to postmortem demonstrations and the study of\r\nsymptoms of diseases.\r\n\r\nTo Benevieni we owe the commencement of the study of gross pathology\r\nand pathological anatomy. Malgaigne remarks of him: “A eulogy which he\r\nmerits, and which he shared with no other person, and which has not\r\nbeen accorded to him up to this time by the many historians of surgery,\r\nwho have superficially searched among these precious sources, is that\r\nhe was the first who had the habit, felt the need, and set the useful\r\nexample, which he transmitted to his successors, of searching in the\r\ncadaver, according to the title of his book, for the concealed causes\r\nof disease.” His observations on anatomical heart lesions, gall-stone,\r\nand presence of parasites in the body, were original. John Fernel, who\r\nhas been surnamed “the modern Galen,” divided medicine into physiology,\r\npathology, and therapeutics. The fundamental maxim of therapeutics,\r\nthat every disease must be combated by contrary remedies, was early\r\nlaid down by him, and he claimed that anything that cured a disease\r\nwas contrary to it. Surgery was placed on a high scale during this\r\nera, as thorough a course as the time afforded was given, and a rigid\r\nexamination held at its termination. Ambroise Paré contributed largely\r\ntoward making this a glorious century. He rose from the lowest walks\r\nof life to the highest professional attainments and honors. He was the\r\nfirst to control hemorrhage by tying the bleeding vessels, thus doing\r\naway with the former crude and painful method of pouring on hot oil.\r\nThis procedure proved quite a boon to surgery; as an instance it may be\r\nmentioned that prior to the introduction of this method in amputations\r\nthe bleeding was controlled by means of a hot iron, and this before the\r\ndays of anæsthesia.\r\n\r\nEvery age of ancient, mediæval, and modern medicine has had its\r\ncharlatans, and the more civilization progresses, the more popular\r\nthese quacks become with certain types of people, particularly those of\r\nthe middle and lower classes, although no class appears to be exempt.\r\nLatent, unscrupulous, and unprincipled, they play upon the credulity of\r\nthe ignorant.\r\n\r\nThe central figure of the mediæval charlatans was Paracelsus, who was\r\ngiven to drink and debauchery. He advertised extensively, similar\r\nto the charlatans of to-day, and exerted an influence in his time.\r\n“The school which he would have founded was nothing but a school of\r\nignorance, dissipation, and boasting—a school of medical dishonesty.”\r\n\r\nDuring the sixteenth century the greatest discoveries took place\r\nin anatomy, based upon dissections, the only rational method of\r\nascertaining anatomical knowledge. The lesser circulation of the blood,\r\nor that through the lungs, was appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the universities were chosen by the students, who\r\nassisted in laying out the curriculum. Compare this with the rigid\r\nmethods of medical instruction now in vogue. The practitioners were of\r\nroving habits, which were evidently contracted during their student\r\ndays, as it was customary for them to go from one school to another,\r\nthe poor classes defraying expenses by begging and singing.\r\n\r\nThere was evident improvement in the social and mental status of\r\nmedical men upon the approach of the seventeenth century, and this\r\nperiod is signalized by the discovery of the circulation of the blood,\r\none of the most important ever made in medicine. Chemistry now assumed\r\nthe dignified aspect of a science, which fact benefited the progress of\r\nmedicine.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for us at the present time to understand why the\r\ncirculation of the blood was not discovered prior to this period, but\r\nto the ancients it was incomprehensible. They believed the arteries\r\ncontained air, because after death they were found empty. William\r\nHarvey, the discoverer of the circulation of the blood, did not publish\r\nthe results of his investigations until 1628, first submitting them to\r\nfifteen years of proof. This naturally revolutionized physiology. The\r\ncapillary circulation, or that intermediate between the arteries and\r\nveins, was described by Malpighi in 1628. Of course this was possible\r\nonly through the means of a microscope. No less remarkable was the\r\ndiscovery of the lymphatic vessels. Peruvian bark (the alkaloid quinine\r\nbeing more commonly employed) so universally employed as a specific for\r\nmalaria, was first used in the early part of this epoch.\r\n\r\nDuring this period ophthalmology (which treats of the diseases of the\r\neye) was cultivated in France, cataract was first recognized, and\r\nthe diseases of the ear first systematically described. Altogether\r\nthe century showed marked progression, closing with the teachings of\r\nSydenham, “the English Hippocrates.”\r\n\r\nThe eighteenth century was one of continued progress. The eminent\r\nobservers devoted more time to microscopical work, studying the\r\nminute structure of the tissues and cells. One of the most prominent\r\nis Lieberkühn, who invented the solar microscope, with which he was\r\nenabled to exhibit the circulation of the blood. The systematic\r\npractice of the preventive inoculation against small-pox by vaccination\r\noriginated in this decade. The first inoculation with cow-pox was\r\nin 1774. Edward Jenner, the English surgeon, was “the father of\r\nvaccination,” which he first did in 1796. About 1800, Dr. Waterhouse,\r\nthen professor of medicine in Harvard College, performed the first\r\nvaccination in America, the patients being his four children.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of the insane was changed from one of torture and\r\nbarbarous methods to a more scientific one, conducive to the comfort\r\nand return to health of the patient.\r\n\r\nThis period marks the earliest example of medical teaching in this\r\ncountry, consisting of the demonstrations of anatomy in Philadelphia by\r\nDr. Thomas Cadwalader, upon his return from Europe. This was previous\r\nto 1750, about which time a body was dissected in New York. In 1754–56\r\nDr. William Hunter of Scotland delivered a series of lectures on\r\nanatomy, accompanied by dissections, at Newport, R. I.\r\n\r\nIn 1762 Dr. Shippen laid the foundation of a medical school in\r\nPhiladelphia, which finally developed into the Medical Department of\r\nthe University of Pennsylvania. This was the first medical school\r\nestablished in this country. In 1768 a school of medicine was organized\r\nin New York, and the next in succession was the Medical Department of\r\nHarvard College in 1782. The fourth was established at Hanover, 1797,\r\nbeing connected with Dartmouth College. These were the only medical\r\ncolleges instituted prior to the present century. The first book on\r\nAmerican surgery was written in 1775 by Dr. John Jones, the title being\r\n“Wounds and Fractures.”\r\n\r\n“The tendency of the nineteenth century seems to be a continuation,\r\nand, perhaps, in some respects an exaggeration of the condition that\r\nobtained in France during the previous century; in other words, the\r\nworld has become practically an enormous school of pathological\r\nanatomy and diagnosis—a school inaugurated by Bichat, as representing\r\nso-called scientific or exact medicine.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DR. OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES.]\r\n\r\nDarwin has promulgated “the most influential philosophic doctrine\r\nof this or any other century.” Our materia medica and the laws of\r\nphysics have been enriched by botanical discoveries, aiding greatly the\r\nexperimental researches of to-day. Helmholz has given us an instrument\r\ncalled the ophthalmoscope, containing a series of numbered magnifying\r\nlenses, with which the interior of the eye can be explored by looking\r\ndirectly through the pupil of the eye, similar to looking through a\r\ndoor into a room. Through his knowledge of physics, Seebach was able\r\nto make fame through his discovery of thermal electricity. Daguerre,\r\nwho invented photography, must not be overlooked, as by means of this\r\nprocess, many conditions are directly appreciated by the eye which\r\ncould not be told in words and still convey an idea of the tumor, etc.,\r\nbeing described. It may not be amiss to mention here that the biograph\r\nwill in a few years prove an important factor in teaching the various\r\noperations. One surgeon in France is now employing it. We must not\r\noverlook Edison and his electrical achievements which directly and\r\nindirectly affect medicine; nor Bell’s telephone, which is sometimes\r\nused to locate a bullet. By placing the receiver to the ear and probing\r\nfor the bullet with electric conductors, the making and breaking of the\r\ncircuit upon contact with the missile is transmitted to the receiver\r\nand distinctly heard. This procedure, however, has been discarded since\r\nthe introduction by Röntgen of the X-ray.\r\n\r\nA very significant feature of the age has been the extraordinary\r\ndevelopment of associations devoted to scientific discussions and\r\nthe publication of medical literature and journals. The formation of\r\nmedical societies, especially in the United States, has been quite\r\nactive. But few counties are without a medical organization, referred\r\nto as “The ... County Medical Society.”\r\n\r\nThe American Medical Association was established by Dr. Nathan Smith\r\nDavis in Philadelphia fifty-two years ago (1847). The first two years\r\nno meetings were held, but since then regular annual meetings have been\r\nin progress, the place of assembly being decided upon by a majority\r\nvote of its members. It has met in the city of its birth five times,\r\nthe founder has been elected president twice, and is still (1900) in\r\nactive practice at the age of eighty-two. He has attended all its\r\nmeetings held in various cities from Boston to San Francisco.\r\n\r\nThe first medical journal in this country appeared in New York, 1797.\r\nIt was called “The New York Repository,” was published quarterly, and\r\nmanaged to reach its twenty-third edition. Fifty years ago there were\r\nabout twenty journals published in the United States. At the end of the\r\ncentury there are two hundred and thirty.\r\n\r\nIn 1810 there were six hundred and fifty students of medicine in\r\nAmerica, and one hundred graduates. At the present writing about twenty\r\nthousand medical students are enrolled in our various colleges, and\r\nduring the spring of 1899 about three thousand five hundred received\r\nthe degree of M. D.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STARLING MEDICAL COLLEGE AND ST. FRANCIS HOSPITAL.]\r\n\r\nThe original branches, practice of medicine, surgery, obstetrics,\r\nphysiology, anatomy, therapeutics, and chemistry, have been subdivided\r\nand specialized. Among the chief of these specialties are gynecology,\r\nwhich treats of diseases of women; pediatrics, which treats of diseases\r\nof children; dermatology, which treats of diseases of the skin;\r\nophthalmology, which treats of diseases of the eye; laryngology, which\r\ntreats of diseases of the throat and larynx; otology, which treats of\r\ndiseases of the ear; neurology, which treats of diseases of the nerves;\r\nmedical jurisprudence, which treats of the relation of medicine to law;\r\npathology, which treats of diseased tissues and organs; bacteriology,\r\nwhich treats of the microbes; and physical diagnosis, which treats of\r\nthe art of discriminating disease by means of the eye, ear, and\r\ntouch. The nucleus of the teaching regarding the latter subject is due\r\nto the efforts and observations of Corvisart, of France. He was the\r\nfirst to ascertain the diseased areas of the lungs, by tapping on the\r\nchest with the fingers, and listening to the pitch of the note thus\r\nelicited. A low, dull note indicates that the lung is solid, as in\r\npneumonia; a flat note that fluid is present, and so on. By placing the\r\near to the chest wall, sounds in health and disease are heard, which\r\nvary in intensity, degree, etc. Laennec discovered by accident that\r\nthis method was greatly improved and the sounds more distinctly heard\r\nif a cylindrical tube was interposed between the ear and the chest\r\nwall. The outcome of this principle is the stethoscope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DR. NATHAN SMITH DAVIS, OF CHICAGO.]\r\n\r\nThe name of Pravaz, the Lyons surgeon, has been perpetuated by the\r\nhypodermic syringe which he devised. The employment of suitable drugs\r\nin this instrument is the method par excellence for relieving pain.\r\nWith it drugs can be injected into unconscious patients. Suicides\r\nwho refuse to swallow emetics can have their stomachs emptied\r\nmost effectually of their contents by a hypodermatic injection of\r\napomorphine.\r\n\r\nThe thermometer used for taking the temperature of the human body is so\r\narranged that the mercury does not descend into the bulb until shaken\r\ndown, hence after taking the temperature it remains uninfluenced until\r\nshaken down. Were an ordinary thermometer used, by the time it was\r\nremoved from the patient to the light the mercury would descend several\r\ndegrees.\r\n\r\nPasteur began the studies of fermentation in 1854. Through his\r\nobservations, aided by the microscope, the opinion was reached that\r\nmicro-organisms played an important role in the causation of disease.\r\nMany of the laboratory investigators became imbued with the spirit,\r\nand through their diligent observations the microbes causing many\r\ndiseases have been isolated. It remained for Koch to discover the\r\ntubercle bacillus, or _Bacillus tuberculosis_, which is the cause of\r\nconsumption. The sputum of a patient, properly stained, and examined\r\nunder the microscope, will at once decide whether that individual has\r\nconsumption.\r\n\r\nHaving ascertained that bacteria were the cause of disease, sepsis\r\n(blood poisoning), etc., it then remained to discover a method of\r\nkilling them, without any undue injury to the patient. Sir Joseph\r\nLister began experiments upon this hypothesis, and in 1867 was able to\r\npublish favorable results. But lo! the world was slow to bend to a new\r\nthought ably demonstrated, and for a score of years he was bitterly\r\nopposed.\r\n\r\nIt was Crawford W. Long, in a little village of Alabama, who, in 1842,\r\nwas the first to put to sleep a patient with ether, and remove a small\r\ngrowth. The patient, upon awakening, had experienced no pain. This\r\nmethod of relieving pain was christened “anæsthesia” several years\r\nlater, by the distinguished Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes, whose writings\r\ndid more than those of any other American to eradicate “child-bed\r\nfever.” Every woman in the land owes him an eternal debt of gratitude.\r\nTo Guthrie, of Sackett’s Harbor, New York, is due the credit of first\r\ndiscovering chloroform, but Sir James Simpson, of Edinburgh, deserves\r\nthe credit of first employing it in medicine.\r\n\r\nThe surgeons of America laid the foundation of gynecology, the progress\r\nof which has been more marked than any department of medicine. The\r\nfirst ovariotomy in the world was performed by Dr. Ephraim McDowell\r\nin Kentucky, December, 1809. This was prior to the days of anæsthesia\r\nand antisepsis, and a howling mob awaited outside, ready to murder the\r\nbrave surgeon should his patient die during the operation. “In five\r\ndays,” says Dr. McDowell, “I visited her, and much to my astonishment\r\nfound her engaged in making up her bed.” Dr. J. Marion Sims, our\r\nillustrious genius who established an international reputation, did\r\nmuch to promulgate plastic work on the female genitalia. The deeds\r\nof medical men are soon forgotten by an ungrateful public, and the\r\nsons of Æsculapius are the last to have monuments erected to their\r\nmemory. But four exist in America; one, in New York, to that grand old\r\ngynecologist, Dr. J. Marion Sims; one in Washington, to Dr. Samuel\r\nD. Gross, “the Nestor of American Surgery;” one in Bushnell Park,\r\nHartford, Conn., to Dr. Horace Wells, the discoverer of anæsthesia; and\r\none in the Public Garden in Boston to the discoverer of anæsthesia.\r\nThis last bears no name. Antisepsis and anæsthesia have played an\r\nunusually important role in obstetrics, by alleviating the sufferings\r\nof childbirth and eradicating child-bed fever, thus reducing the\r\nmortality of both mother and child.\r\n\r\nPhysiology has made very rapid strides during this era. Beaumont, in\r\nhis famous work, describes digestion in the stomach and experiments on\r\nthe gastric juice. He was enabled to observe this in a voyageur who\r\nwas accidentally wounded in the stomach by the discharge of a musket,\r\nJune, 1822. Quite a large opening remained, which Nature closed with\r\na valve. By pushing the valve to one side, the interior of the stomach\r\ncould be explored.\r\n\r\nThrough the work of the experimental physiologists in the laboratories,\r\nthe study of the action of drugs on the lungs, heart, liver, stomach,\r\nnerves, etc., has been greatly enhanced.\r\n\r\nAnatomy is now being taught by the only true method, and that is\r\ndissection. Didactic lectures are given, but the student must dissect\r\nevery part of the human body before he can receive his degree. Formerly\r\ngraves were robbed, and the bodies sold to the colleges. Now, however,\r\nthrough legislative enactment, unclaimed bodies are turned over to the\r\ncolleges, where they are preserved either by injection, a pickling\r\nprocess, or by cold storage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: J. MARION SIMS, A.B., M.D., (Late Surgeon to the Woman’s\r\nHospital, New York.)]\r\n\r\nThe ophthalmologists of to-day fear nothing inside nor outside the eye.\r\nCross eyes are straightened, cataracts removed, eyeballs taken out and\r\nglass eyes inserted.\r\n\r\nThis article would be incomplete, were not a few remarks directed\r\ntoward the trained nurse.\r\n\r\nThe first training school for nurses in America was established in\r\nconnection with the Lying-in Charity Hospital of Philadelphia in 1828.\r\nThis school, still in existence, thus has the honor of being the oldest\r\nin this country, and is antedated by only one abroad.\r\n\r\nThe generally recognized profession for women, that of the trained\r\nnurse, is practically of recent development. Twenty-five years ago\r\nthe training school connected with the Bellevue Hospital, New York,\r\ngraduated a class of five nurses. This was a marked departure in the\r\nmedical history of this country. Since then the demand for the trained\r\nnurse has been great, and no hospital is complete without such a\r\ntraining school.\r\n\r\nThe progress of medicine in the nineteenth century has been far\r\nmore rapid, creditable, and momentous than during any like period\r\nof the past. This is true not only in the United States, but in\r\nevery civilized country. Its entire scope, meaning, and purpose have\r\nundergone changes equivalent to revolution. Antique superstitions,\r\nidle theories, foolish speculations, absurd practices, the ridiculous\r\njealousies and incriminations of opposing schools, have been largely\r\neliminated. Medical institutions are upon the loftiest plane in their\r\nhistory. Teachers are better endowed than ever before. Periods of\r\nscholastic preparation have been lengthened and curriculums enlarged,\r\nthus securing for the fields of practice a higher mental equipment and\r\nmore conscionable devotion to duty. Never before have the auxiliary\r\nand material agencies been turned to so frequent and preventive\r\naccount. Electricity, the microscope, anæsthesia, antisepsis,\r\nlaboratory experiment, hospital opportunities, etc., are ever constant\r\ninspirations to skilled treatment and fresh researches. As the grand\r\narmy of humanitarian workers was never so large as at the end of the\r\ncentury, so it was never better fortified for attack upon the enemies\r\nof health, fuller of enthusiasm or more deeply established in the\r\npublic confidence. One may not, as yet, assert that medicine is ridding\r\nitself of empiricism with a satisfactory degree of rapidity, or that\r\nit has arrived at the stage of an exact science, but it surely has\r\napproached such a stage as nearly as conditions will allow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEVOLUTION OF THE RAILWAY\r\n\r\nBY E. E. RUSSELL TRATMAN, C.E.,\r\n\r\n_Assistant Editor of “Engineering News,” Chicago_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe railway as a means of rapid transportation and general\r\nintercommunication is one of the most important factors in the\r\ndevelopment of modern commerce and civilization, and, after reviewing\r\nwhat it has done and become in the nineteenth century, one cannot\r\nhelp wishing for the opportunity to review the railway wonders of the\r\ntwentieth century.\r\n\r\nWhile the history of the railway dates back far beyond the nineteenth\r\ncentury, yet the railway, as we know it to-day, is essentially a\r\nproduct of this century. It dates, in fact, from England in 1830, when\r\nthe Liverpool & Manchester Railway, 31 miles long, was opened, and\r\nwas operated from the beginning by steam locomotives. The Stockton &\r\nDarlington Railway, 37 miles, was opened in 1825, but this line was\r\nintended only for private coal traffic, while the other line was built\r\nfor general passenger and freight service, and for the use and benefit\r\nof the public.\r\n\r\nThe United States followed this lead very closely. In 1828 the Delaware\r\n& Hudson Canal Company built a line from its mines to its canal at\r\nHonesdale. This was a private coal road, however, and may best be\r\ncompared to the Stockton & Darlington Railway. The first public railway\r\noperated by steam was the Mohawk & Hudson Railway, from Albany to\r\nSchenectady, 16 miles, which was opened in 1831. The Baltimore & Ohio\r\nRailway was the first railway enterprise of more than local character,\r\nbeing designed to open communication with the Ohio River, a distance of\r\n400 miles. It was chartered in 1827, commenced in 1828, completed to\r\nEllicott’s Mills (13 miles) in 1830, and to Washington (40 miles) in\r\n1834. It is one of the great monuments of the American railway system,\r\nand it was examined by government commissions from Russia and Austria\r\nin 1831 and 1849.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the railway we unconsciously associate with it the steam\r\nlocomotive, since the two are so entirely interdependent. Railways\r\noperated by horses, or by cables and stationary engines, could never\r\nhave become the great civilizing and commercial medium which the\r\nrailway operated by swift locomotives has become. Similarly, the\r\ndevelopment of the locomotive grew apace, as soon as it was recognized\r\nthat the smooth track of the railway—and not the rough track of the\r\nhighway—was to be its field of operation.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the nineteenth century, after seventy years of\r\ndevelopment, the world has nearly 500,000 miles of railway, on which\r\nlocomotives of 80 to 110 tons in weight (without their tenders) haul\r\nfreight trains of 1000 to 3000 tons. Passenger trains, too, are run\r\nat speeds of 40 to 75 miles per hour in regular daily service, and\r\neven make bursts of speed at 80 to 100 miles per hour. The fact that\r\nin 1890 Europe and North America had about 320,000 miles of railway\r\nout of a grand total of 370,000 miles, indicates that this phase of\r\nnineteenth-century progress has been due mainly to peoples of Christian\r\ncivilization, and besides this, it must be remembered that the\r\nrailways of Asia, Africa, Australia, and South America have been mainly\r\nbuilt by the same peoples. The central regions of these four latter\r\ngeographical divisions are fields for twentieth-century development.\r\n\r\nThe great trunk lines of railway communication are hardly more\r\nimportant than the vast network of branch and minor lines which connect\r\nand intersect them. These latter lines bring the people of smaller\r\ntowns and country districts into closer relation with the large cities,\r\nthe centres of industrial and intellectual energy, enterprise, and\r\nwealth. They thus tend to reduce isolation and dependence upon purely\r\nlocal resources.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OLD STAGE COACH.]\r\n\r\nRailways also serve important military and strategic purposes. In India\r\nmany of the railways have been built with a view to the defense of the\r\nnortheastern frontier, and many European governments assume certain\r\nmilitary authority over the railways. The first trans-continental\r\nrailways of the United States and Canada were largely assisted by\r\ngovernment subsidies on account of their great importance for the\r\ntransportation of troops. The railway also serves purposes of pleasure,\r\nas well as of commerce and war. Not only do the ordinary railways carry\r\nmuch tourist and pleasure travel, but lines are built exclusively for\r\nsuch travel. Some of these take people to the summer and pleasure\r\nresorts, while others cater to the inherent desire of man to ascend\r\ngreat altitudes and to behold the world in its beauty and grandeur\r\nspread below them. For this purpose alone have railways been built to\r\nthe summits of the Rockies, the Alps, and other mountain ranges.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the century the United States has about 185,000 miles\r\nof railway, which have cost about $53,000 per mile and earn $6500 per\r\nmile. Great Britain has about 22,000 miles, which have cost $225,000\r\nper mile and earn about $20,000 per mile. A large proportion of this\r\nhigh cost of construction is due to the high prices for land and to the\r\npreliminary parliamentary proceedings which are necessary in securing\r\nthe right to build railways. The average cost per mile of railways in\r\ndifferent countries is as follows:—\r\n\r\n  United States                $53,000\r\n  India                         75,000\r\n  Japan                         92,000\r\n  France                       100,000\r\n  Germany                      101,500\r\n  Switzerland (ordinary)      $119,300\r\n      Do      (mountain)       162,500\r\n  Russia                       122,000\r\n  Austria-Hungary              125,400\r\n  Great Britain                225,000\r\n\r\nOne of the great economic purposes of railways in new countries is\r\nto reduce the cost of rapid transportation in bulk far below that of\r\nslow transportation in small quantities. Train speed is a matter of\r\nsecondary importance in such cases, the traffic accommodation and\r\ncapacity of the slowest train being far beyond that of road or canal\r\ntransportation. Traffic will be served better and at much less cost by\r\nbeing carried in bulk on 500 miles of railway at 10 miles per hour,\r\nthan on 100 miles of railway at 35 miles per hour, and then in small\r\nlots on wagons or canal boats at 3 miles per hour for 400 miles.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of the rapid transportation of perishable freight by\r\nrail, especially in regard to food supplies for cities, were early\r\nrecognized, and by 1854 the trains brought car-loads of country milk\r\ninto London every day. Previous to this, the supply was obtained from\r\ncows kept in stables, which was an unsanitary and expensive plan.\r\nAnother immediate result of railway service was that people began\r\nto live farther out of the towns, and then began the growth of the\r\nsuburban residence districts, which are such a feature of modern cities\r\nand city life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIRST TRAIN OF STEAM CARS.]\r\n\r\nThe early railways were built merely as local lines, and there was\r\nlittle idea of their ultimate connection or extension. These small\r\nindividual lines, however, with their own rate-making powers and\r\nsystems of management, have been consolidated into great systems, thus\r\neffecting material economies and facilities in operation. Thus the\r\nMohawk & Hudson Railway of 1831 was the first of a series of lines\r\nnow consolidated to form the New York Central Railway; while the\r\nLiverpool & Manchester Railway of 1830 was the beginning of what is\r\nnow the London & Northwestern Railway system. Not only is there this\r\nconsolidation, but also a most comprehensive system for the interchange\r\nof traffic between different systems. Thus passengers can purchase\r\nthrough tickets and travel through from Paris to St. Petersburg, or\r\nfrom Boston to San Francisco, while freight cars can be sent through\r\nin a similar way. This is really a wonderful feature of railway\r\ndevelopment. The following are a few examples of the great railway\r\nsystems of the world:—\r\n\r\n -------------------------------------+------+--------+---------+-------\r\n              Railway.                |Miles.| Loco-  |Passenger|Freight\r\n                                      |      |motives.|  Cars.  | Cars.\r\n -------------------------------------+------+--------+---------+-------\r\n Pennsylvania (U.S.A.)                | 8882 |  3594  |  3847   |146,060\r\n Chicago & Northwestern (U.S.A.)      | 7996 |  1380  |  1176   | 49,484\r\n Chicago, Burlington & Quincy (U.S.A.)| 7462 |  1205  |   936   | 40,720\r\n Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fé (U.S.A.) | 7120 |  1036  |   655   | 29,837\r\n Great Western (England)              | 2576 |  1837  |  6201   | 53,156\r\n London & Northwestern (England)      | 1912 |  2851  |  8446   | 65,456\r\n Paris, Lyons & Mediterranean (France)| 5594 |  2624  |  5837   | 87,320\r\n Western (France)                     | 3464 |  1492  |  4378   | 26,487\r\n Mediterranean (Italy)                | 3568 |  1314  |  3706   | 23,077\r\n Northwestern (India)                 | 3371 |   602  |  2121   | 10,312\r\n -------------------------------------+------+--------+---------+-------\r\n\r\nIn some countries the government owns and operates all, or nearly\r\nall, of the railways, as in Germany, Belgium, and the African and\r\nAustralian colonies. Switzerland, in 1898, decided that its government\r\nshould acquire the railways. In Holland and Italy the government owns\r\nthe railways, but leases them to operating companies. France, Brazil,\r\nand the Argentine Republic have both state and private lines, with a\r\ngreater or less degree of state assistance and control of the latter.\r\nIn Great Britain the railways are owned entirely by private companies,\r\nbut their operation is subject to government supervision in the public\r\ninterests. In the United States there was at first almost absolute\r\nfreedom of construction, but the consequent abuses and financial\r\ndisasters, owing to unnecessary lines and cut-throat competition,\r\nhave led some of the States to wisely exercise some degree of control\r\nover railway affairs. The interference of the federal government in\r\nrailway affairs has been slight but important. In 1862 it aided the\r\nconstruction of the first transcontinental railway; in 1887 it passed\r\nthe act for the regulation of rates, etc., in interstate traffic; and\r\nin 1893 it passed the act making compulsory the use of power brakes and\r\nautomatic couplers on freight cars.\r\n\r\nGovernment ownership and operation of railways is rarely satisfactory\r\nfrom a financial or a traffic point of view, but, on the other hand,\r\nan absolutely unrestricted railway element is liable to become a\r\nserious evil. The best system is undoubtedly that in which the railways\r\nare owned and operated by private enterprise, but subject to state\r\nsupervision, like steamships, factories, etc. It must not be forgotten,\r\nhowever, that private enterprise is not always available. In Russia,\r\nfor example, the development of railways would have been but slow on\r\nsuch a basis; and in India, government backing was needed to induce\r\nBritish capitalists to enter the field. It is unfortunate for China\r\nthat neither the government nor the people have been competent or\r\nenterprising enough to deal with the railway question. The present\r\nsystem of development by rival interests of various nationalities\r\nseems almost certain to lead to the eventual dissolution of the empire\r\nand its partition among other nations, as Africa is already in large\r\nmeasure partitioned.\r\n\r\nIn the United States railway construction has gone by leaps and bounds,\r\nand there is now a vast network of lines,—main, secondary, branch, and\r\nlocal. The highest records of construction within the past twenty years\r\nwere 12,800 miles built in 1887, and 11,600 miles in 1882, while the\r\nlowest record was 1750 miles in 1896. The growth from 1886 to 1899 has\r\nbeen as follows, the relatively small increase in number of locomotives\r\nbeing due to the greater power of modern engines:—\r\n\r\n  ---------------------+-------------+--------------+----------\r\n                       |             |              | Increase,\r\n                       |    1886.    |     1899.    | per cent.\r\n  ---------------------+-------------+--------------+----------\r\n  Mileage              |    133,600  |     185,000  |   88.47\r\n  Tonnage carried      |482,000,000  | 780,000,000  |   62.00\r\n  Number of cars       |    871,500  |   1,330,000  |   52.61\r\n  Number of locomotives|     26,400  |      36,000  |   36.30\r\n  ---------------------+-------------+--------------+----------\r\n\r\nPerhaps the railway of most recent interest is the first line in\r\nAlaska, which is twenty miles long, and was built as a result of\r\nthe rush to the Klondike gold fields. This was opened on February\r\n20, 1899. The great transcontinental railways, however, are of much\r\nbroader interest. In 1835 the Rev. Samuel Parker, a missionary in\r\nthe Northwest, suggested a railway from the Atlantic to the Pacific,\r\nand Dr. Samuel E. Barlow proposed one from New York to the Columbia\r\nRiver, 2000 miles, to cost $10,000 per mile, and to carry traffic at\r\nabout seven miles per hour. From 1844 to 1849 Mr. Asa Whitney urged\r\nCongress to grant land to aid him in building a line from Lake Michigan\r\nto San Francisco, 2030 miles, to cost $20,000 per mile. Between 1853\r\nand 1861 Congress had surveys made of five routes, but no definite\r\naction was taken until after the outbreak of the Civil War, in 1861,\r\nwhen the federal government soon recognized the importance of having\r\ndirect communication with the Pacific States, which were at that time\r\nisolated. Companies were organized in 1862, and work commenced in 1864,\r\nunder government subsidies and military aid and protection. On May 10,\r\n1869, the Union Pacific Railway (from the east) and the Central Pacific\r\nRailway (from the west) met at Promontory Point, Utah, 1186 miles from\r\nthe Missouri River and 638 miles from Sacramento, Cal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A RAILWAY TRAIN IN BELGIUM.]\r\n\r\nNow, thirty years later, we have six so-called transcontinental\r\nrailways, no one of which, however, has its own line from ocean to\r\nocean, and none of which run through trains or cars. In Canada,\r\nhowever, the Canadian Pacific Railway (opened in 1887) has a through\r\nline from St. John and Montreal to Vancouver, with through trains daily\r\nbetween the latter points, 2905 miles. The principal transcontinental\r\nlines, with the total distances from ocean to ocean, are shown on the\r\nfollowing page.\r\n\r\n  -------------------+-------+------------------------+-------+---------\r\n                     |       |                        |       |  Total\r\n        Railway.     |Opened.|          Route.        |Length.|Distance.\r\n  -------------------+-------+------------------------+-------+---------\r\n  1.

This was opened as long ago as\r\n1855, and was originally intended as a link in a route between New\r\nYork and San Francisco, 5450 miles. In South America there are few\r\nrailways of great importance, and the interior yet remains undeveloped,\r\nwith the exception of the great plains of the Argentine Republic. A\r\ntranscontinental line between Buenos Ayres and Valparaiso, 850 miles,\r\nis nearly completed, but work has been stopped for some years, leaving\r\n50 miles yet to be built at the summit of the Andes. An interesting,\r\nbut as yet visionary, scheme is that for an intercontinental railway\r\nthrough Central and South America. The distance from the southern\r\nfrontier of Mexico to Buenos Ayres would be 5500 miles. About 1280\r\nmiles of this are built, but comprise many small lines which would have\r\nto be rebuilt. The total cost would be about $220,000,000, at a low\r\nestimate, and the total distance from New York to Buenos Ayres would be\r\n10,300 miles by rail.\r\n\r\nIn Europe there is a vast and comprehensive network of railway lines,\r\nbut the distances are less, even St. Petersburg and Constantinople\r\nbeing but about 1600 and 1800 miles from Paris. While the development\r\nof railways has been remarkable, the most striking features are\r\nthe lines which cross the Alps to connect the interior with the\r\nMediterranean ports. The first of these was the Semmering railway, on\r\nthe route between Vienna and Trieste (1854). The Mont Cenis railway\r\n(1867) was mainly a surface line, with heavy inclines operated on the\r\nFell grip-rail system. Its route followed the great carriage road built\r\nby Napoleon in 1803–10. The railway over the Brenner Pass was opened\r\nin 1868; in 1871 the Mont Cenis tunnel superseded the high-level line,\r\nand in 1880 the Great St. Gothard railway was opened. This was followed\r\nby the Arlberg railway in 1884, and the Simplon railway is now under\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\nEurope has the only railway within the Arctic Circle. It runs from\r\nLulea, on the Gulf of Bothnia, northwest to the Gellivara iron mines,\r\n44 miles within the circle. As the port is closed by ice during the\r\nwinter, the line is to be extended to the Atlantic coast at Ofoten, 69°\r\nnorth latitude, where the influence of the Gulf Stream keeps the ports\r\nopen. This end of the line will be 130 miles north of the Arctic Circle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOOP IN THE SELKIRKS, SHOWING FOUR TRACKS.]\r\n\r\nThe countries of Asia (with the exception of India) are but scantily\r\nsupplied with railways. Even Palestine—the Holy Land—has, however,\r\nbeen invaded, and has now two railways. One of these is from Jaffa\r\n(the biblical Joppa) to Jerusalem, 54 miles (1892); the other\r\nis from Beirut to Damascus, 70 miles. British interests have long\r\nadvocated an “all-rail-to-India” project. The line would start opposite\r\nConstantinople, pass down the Euphrates valley, across Persia, and\r\nalong the coast of Baluchistan to Kurrachee, connecting there with\r\nthe Indian railway system. This great system aggregates 25,000 miles,\r\nand extends up to the Bolan Pass and the Khyber Pass, on the Afghan\r\nfrontier. Southward, it has been proposed to connect with the Ceylon\r\nrailways by a line of bridges and embankments along the reefs and\r\nshoals known as Adam’s Bridge.\r\n\r\nOwing to the vigorous opposition of the government and people, China\r\nhas but 350 miles of railway to its 4,200,000 square miles and its\r\npopulation of 420,000,000. Many lines are projected, but are all in\r\nthe eastern portion, and the twentieth century will be well advanced\r\nbefore the railway opens up the heart of the country to civilization.\r\nJapan, the very opposite of China, has encouraged railway construction,\r\nand now has 3000 miles of railway to its 147,600 square miles and its\r\npopulation of 45,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe most notable of all the railways in Asia is the great\r\nTrans-Siberian railway, now being built by the Russian government. It\r\nwas commenced in 1891, and may be completed by 1903, the distance from\r\nSt. Petersburg to Vladivostok, or Port Arthur, being then about 5670\r\nmiles. There are several large cities on the route, and the line does\r\nnot pass through such a wild and uninhabited country as that through\r\nwhich the Union Pacific Railroad was built thirty years ago. It is\r\nnow open to Lake Baikal, the trip of 3230 miles being made in about\r\n12 days by the slow train, or 8 days by the less frequent fast train.\r\nThe road is roughly and lightly built in many respects, so that high\r\nspeeds cannot be maintained. The eastern end of the road will pass\r\nthrough Chinese territory, thus giving Russia a firm foothold in that\r\nempire. Hardly less interesting is the Trans-Caspian railway, from the\r\nCaspian Sea to Samarcand, 885 miles, with a branch from Merv to within\r\n95 miles of the Afghan city of Herat. An extension to the Persian Gulf\r\nis also projected. As the Trans-Siberian railway has developed a new\r\nwheat-growing region, so the Trans-Caspian railway is developing a new\r\ncotton-growing region.\r\n\r\nIn Africa the railways already extend northward from Cape Town, through\r\nthe land of the Boers and up to Buluwayo, the old Zulu stronghold,\r\n1400 miles. There is a picturesque project for carrying the line\r\non to the Mediterranean, a total distance of 5500 miles, but this\r\nwill not materialize for many years. The Congo railway, passing the\r\nrapids, opens communication between the coast and a long stretch of\r\ninland navigation. Several lines are being pushed from the east coast\r\ninto the interior, and a transcontinental railway from St. Paul de\r\nLoando, on the west, has been commenced, but there is not now much\r\nlife in this latter project. The French have two favorite schemes for\r\nrailways,—from Algeria to Timbuctoo, and from Tunis to Lake Chad, the\r\nlatter line being about 1600 miles in length.\r\n\r\nIn Australia, the lines of the different colonies are gradually\r\nextending and connecting to form a continuous system, which is\r\nhampered, however, by differences of gauge. There is railway\r\ncommunication between the capitals of Queensland (Brisbane), New South\r\nWales (Sydney), Victoria (Melbourne), and South Australia (Adelaide).\r\nThe great stretch westward to the coast cities of Western Australia is\r\nyet in the future, as is also the South Australian transcontinental\r\nline from Adelaide northward across vast deserts (already crossed by\r\nthe telegraph) to Palmerston.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENTRANCE TO ST. GOTHARD TUNNEL, SWITZERLAND.]\r\n\r\nGreat bridges and tunnels are among the prominent features of the\r\nrailways of the world, but space forbids entering into details of these\r\nworks. They are in principle similar to those required for highways,\r\nbut many of these great works would never have been undertaken for\r\nsuch traffic as is carried by a highway. The only railway suspension\r\nbridge ever built was the Niagara bridge, opened in 1855, and replaced\r\nby a steel arch in 1898. The development of bridges and traffic may\r\nbe judged from the fact that the Victoria single-track tubular bridge\r\nover the St. Lawrence, at Montreal, which was opened in 1859, was\r\nreplaced in 1897–98 by a double-track railway and roadway truss bridge\r\non the same piers. The steel arch bridge, 1700 feet long, across the\r\nMississippi, at St. Louis, cost $5,300,000. The tubular bridge, 6592\r\nfeet long, over the St. Lawrence, at Montreal, Canada, cost $7,000,000.\r\nThe cantilever bridge, 8925 feet long, over the Firth of Forth,\r\nGreat Britain, cost $13,000,000. The cost of the proposed suspension\r\nbridge, 3000 feet long, over the Hudson, at New York, is estimated\r\nat $13,000,000. The first railway tunnel was the Portage Tunnel, in\r\nPennsylvania, built in 1831. The longest railway tunnel is the Simplon,\r\nin Switzerland. It is 12.25 miles in length, and is still under\r\nconstruction. The next longest is the Gothard, Switzerland. It is 9.30\r\nmiles long, and was opened in 1881.\r\n\r\nIn track construction, cast-iron rails began to be superseded by\r\nwrought iron in 1820, and many of the early American railways had\r\nstrap iron laid on timber stringers. Within the past twenty years steel\r\nhas been used almost exclusively. In place of rails weighing 25 to 35\r\nlbs. per yard, and 3 to 15 feet in length, we now use rails of 80 to\r\n100 lbs. per yard, 30 to 60 feet long. Stone blocks and wooden ties\r\nwere first used to support the rails, and the latter are now generally\r\nused, although metal ties are extensively used and date back to 1846.\r\nIn 1894 there were thirty-five thousand miles of railway laid with this\r\nform of track. The next development will probably be a permanent and\r\ncontinuous concrete bed for the rails; as the present construction,\r\nwith wooden ties laid in stone or other ballast, requires continual\r\nattention and repair under the effects of heavy traffic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RAILWAY SIGNALS.]\r\n\r\nThe semaphore signal was introduced in England by Mr. C. H. Gregory in\r\n1841, and is now used in all parts of the world, to govern and protect\r\ntrain movements. The first interlocking plant was erected in 1843, and\r\nthe complete plants—as used to-day—date from 1856. Now, practically\r\nall important junctions are equipped with interlocking plants, which\r\nprevent conflicting signals and switches being so set as to lead to\r\naccident. The electric telegraph was patented by Cooke and Wheatstone\r\nin 1837, and in 1839 they secured its introduction to govern the train\r\nservice on the Great Western Railway (England). The movements were\r\ntelegraphed from station to station, and a train was not allowed to\r\nleave a station until the preceding train had passed the next station\r\nin advance. This was the beginning of the “block system,” which is a\r\ngreat element in the safe operation of traffic, since it maintains an\r\ninterval of space between trains. Mr. Edwin Clark’s telegraph block\r\nsystem was introduced in 1853, and as traffic increased intermediate\r\nblock signal stations were established between the regular stations, so\r\nas to shorten the distances between trains. This system is compulsory\r\nin Great Britain and is already largely used in the United States.\r\nIt was at first held that it was not adapted to conditions in this\r\ncountry, where so many lines have but a single track, but experience\r\nhas shown that it increases the facility as well as the safety of\r\noperating traffic on single and double track lines alike.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN AMERICAN EXPRESS LOCOMOTIVE.]\r\n\r\nSteam locomotives were used on colliery railways in England as early\r\nas 1804, when Trevithick built an engine, which was the first to haul\r\na train on rails. George Stephenson built his first locomotive in\r\n1814, and in 1825 built the “Locomotion” for the Stockton & Darlington\r\nRailway. Horses, stationary engines, and steam locomotives were all\r\nproposed for the Liverpool & Manchester Railway, and in 1829 the\r\ndirectors offered a premium of $2500 for the best locomotive. Each\r\nengine was to consume its smoke, weigh about 6 tons, cost not more than\r\n$2750, and be capable of hauling a train of 20 tons at 10 miles per\r\nhour. This led to the now historical trials at Rainhill, in October,\r\n1829, between the “Rocket” (Stephenson), the “Novelty” (Braithwaite\r\nand Ericson), and the “Sans Pareil” (Hackworth). The award was made\r\nto the “Rocket” as the most practicable machine, although the\r\n“Novelty” attained a higher speed, and the “Sans Pareil” was also a\r\ngood engine and continued in use for several years. Seguin introduced\r\nthe locomotive in France in 1827, having modified and rebuilt an old\r\nStephenson engine.\r\n\r\nThe first locomotive operated in the United States was the imported\r\n“Stourbridge Lion,” on the Delaware & Hudson Canal Co.’s line, in\r\n1829. Cooper’s “Tom Thumb” was run on the Baltimore & Ohio Railway\r\nin 1830, and in 1831 the directors of this road offered premiums of\r\n$4000 and $3500 for locomotives. Each engine was to weigh not more\r\nthan 3½ tons, to have four wheels, and to haul loads of 15 tons at 15\r\nmiles per hour for 30 days. Five engines were presented, by Davis,\r\nCostell, Milholland, Childs, and James. The prizes were awarded to the\r\nfirst two, the Davis engine “York” being rebuilt under the direction\r\nof its inventor and Mr. Ross Winans, while the “Costell” was put in\r\nswitching service. In 1831 the “John Bull” was built by the Stephensons\r\nin England, and was put in service on the Camden & Amboy Railway\r\n(U. S. A.) in the same year. In 1893 this old engine was readjusted and\r\nran from New York to Chicago, 912 miles, under its own steam, hauling\r\ntwo cars of the type of 1836.\r\n\r\nIn 1898 there were about 19,500 locomotives in Great Britain and 36,500\r\nin the United States. As a comparison between the little engines of\r\nearly days and the huge and swift engines of to-day, it may be stated\r\nthat modern passenger locomotives are now constructed with as many as\r\nsix driving wheels, and ten wheels in all. Some of those in use on the\r\nGreat Northern Railway, Great Britain, have driving wheels of 97 inches\r\nin diameter. On the Fitchburg Railway, U. S. A., locomotives are in use\r\nwhich weigh 75 tons. Some modern freight locomotives have as many as\r\nten driving wheels, and twelve wheels in all, and a total weight of 115\r\ntons.\r\n\r\nSince the application of electric traction to street railways, it has\r\nfrequently been said that it would eventually supersede the steam\r\nlocomotive. In no instance, however, has it yet been applied to regular\r\nrailway service, with heavy trains and long runs, nor is there yet\r\nany indication of increased economy or efficiency due to its use in\r\nsuch service. It is successfully used for local and suburban lines,\r\nbut these form a class in themselves, and the conditions of operation\r\nare very different from those which obtain in ordinary service. The\r\nBaltimore & Ohio Railway has some heavy electric locomotives, but these\r\nare for hauling trains through a tunnel, to avoid the trouble and\r\ndiscomfort from the smoke and gases from the steam engines.\r\n\r\nThe early passenger cars were either open cars with cross seats, or had\r\ncoach bodies on four-wheel platform cars. The coach-body cars on the\r\nMohawk & Hudson Railway, in 1831, were 7 ft. 4 in. long and 5 ft. wide.\r\nIn 1836 the American type of car was introduced on the Camden & Amboy\r\nRailway, having a long body mounted on two four-wheeled trucks. These\r\ncars seated 48 passengers, and cars for 60 passengers were in use in\r\n1839, their cost being $2400. American day cars are now 60 to 80 ft.\r\nlong, seating 60 to 84 passengers, and weighing from 30 to 47 tons. The\r\nstandard day car of the Pennsylvania Railway is 60 ft. 7 in. long over\r\nall, and seats 66 passengers. Dining and sleeping cars weigh from 45 to\r\n65 tons, much of the weight being due to the special equipment for the\r\ncomfort and convenience of passengers, and consequently so much dead\r\nweight to be hauled. It can be said without dispute that in no other\r\ncountry have the railways done so much for the comfort and convenience\r\nof their passengers, and have charged so little therefor.\r\n\r\nIn Europe, the cars developed into the compartment system, with side\r\ndoors, there being high transverse partitions with seats on each side,\r\nso that in a full compartment half the passengers must ride backward.\r\nThe cars are usually short, with two or three axles, but about 1872 the\r\nAmerican system of mounting cars on trucks was introduced, and longer\r\ncars on trucks are now somewhat extensively used. Within later years\r\ncorridor cars have been introduced, with a corridor connecting the\r\ncompartments. Such details as steam heat, toilet arrangements, ample\r\nlight, luxurious finish, etc., which have long been a matter of course\r\nin this country, are quite “end of the century” improvements in Europe,\r\nand generally below the standards observed in this country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN AMERICAN FREIGHT LOCOMOTIVE.]\r\n\r\nSleeping cars were used on the Cumberland Valley Railway (U. S. A.)\r\nin 1836. In 1856, Mr. T. L. Woodruff built a sleeping car, and in\r\n1857 two were built by Mr. Webster Wagner and operated on the New\r\nYork Central Railway. Mr. George M. Pullman began his experiments in\r\n1859, and in 1864 he put in service on the Chicago & Alton Railway the\r\nfirst sleeping car with the berth arrangements now almost universally\r\nused. He pushed the business more vigorously than his predecessors\r\nand acquired many of their patents. The Pullman Palace Car Co. was\r\norganized in 1867, and in 1879 its various works were all concentrated\r\nin a new industrial town—called Pullman—near Chicago. In 1898 the\r\ncompany owned 2,428 cars, which were operated on 121,236 miles of\r\nrailway, ran 190,562,758 miles, and carried 4,852,400 passengers.\r\nMost of the cars are in the United States, but some are in Europe and\r\nAustralia. The Wagner Palace Car Co. owns 560 sleeping cars and 143\r\nparlor cars. In Europe most of the long distance sleeping and dining\r\ncar service is operated by the International Sleeping Car Co., which\r\nruns cars between Paris and Constantinople (72 hours), Paris and St.\r\nPetersburg (120 hours), Calais and Brindisi (25 hours).\r\n\r\nPassenger cars are now usually lighted by oil, the mineral oil used in\r\nAmerica being superior to the vegetable oils commonly used in Europe.\r\nOil gas, compressed in tanks, is very extensively used, and gives an\r\nexcellent light. The system was invented by Mr. Julius Pintsch, and was\r\nintroduced in Germany in 1873, and in the United States in 1881. It is\r\nnow applied to about 85,000 cars in 22 countries; 32,000 of these cars\r\nbeing in Germany, 17,000 in Great Britain, and 15,000 in the United\r\nStates. The electric light is as yet used only on a few of the finest\r\nexpress trains, the current being generated either from a steam engine\r\nand dynamo in the baggage car, or from a dynamo on each car, driven\r\nfrom one of the car axles. Storage batteries maintain the light when\r\nthe cars are at rest. American cars were heated by stoves at a very\r\nearly date, and this developed into the hot water system, with a stove\r\nand circulating pipes in each car. Steam from the locomotive, however,\r\nis now generally employed, and its use is compulsory in some States.\r\nIn Europe the passengers have to rely largely upon their own wraps and\r\nrugs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EXTERIOR OF LATEST SLEEPING CAR.]\r\n\r\nIn American freight cars, great improvements have been introduced,\r\nincreasing the carrying capacity while reducing the weight. The\r\ncapacity has been increased from 10 tons of load in 1870, to 30, 40,\r\nand even 50 tons in 1899 (an increase of 300 to 500 per cent). The\r\nweight has increased only from 10 to 15 or 17 tons (or 50 to 70 per\r\ncent). Cars are now being built entirely of steel, and while their\r\nfirst cost is greater, the cost per ton and the expenses of maintenance\r\nare less than for wooden cars of similar capacity. As sleeping, dining,\r\nparlor, tourist, and other special cars have been introduced for\r\npassenger traffic, so refrigerator, stock, horse, fruit, poultry, and\r\nfurniture cars have been introduced for special requirements in freight\r\ntraffic. In other countries, however, the use of such special equipment\r\nis much more limited. The ordinary foreign freight cars are the same\r\nas those of 30 or 40 years ago, being short four-wheel cars, weighing\r\n5 tons, and carrying 8 to 10 tons. These are not well adapted to the\r\nhandling of bulk freight, and greatly increased economy and facility\r\nin such traffic would result from the introduction of the American\r\nsystem, as has been done in Australia. In modern American practice,\r\ntoo, the cars are equipped with automatic couplers and power brakes,\r\nthus greatly increasing the safety and facility of operating heavy fast\r\ntrains. In 1893, Congress passed a law requiring that by January 1,\r\n1898, all freight cars should be equipped with automatic couplers and\r\nenough cars equipped with power brakes (operated from the engine) to\r\nput the trains entirely under the control of the enginemen. The date\r\nwas afterwards extended to January 1, 1900.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR OF A PULLMAN SLEEPING CAR.]\r\n\r\nAs the speed and weight of trains increased, the dangers due to lack\r\nof brake power soon became alarmingly apparent, and numerous forms\r\nof continuous brakes were devised, to be applied to the wheels of\r\nevery car, under the control of the engineman. In 1889, the British\r\ngovernment passed the Railways Regulation Act, making compulsory the\r\nuse of the block system, the interlocking system, and continuous\r\nbrakes. In England and some other foreign countries, the vacuum brake\r\n(introduced about 1871) is largely used, but it is slower in action\r\nthan the compressed air brake, and is therefore less efficient for\r\nlong, heavy, and fast trains.\r\n\r\nThe Westinghouse brake is one of the most important factors in the\r\nsafe and efficient handling of heavy and fast trains. Mr. George\r\nWestinghouse patented his straight-air brake in 1869, his plain\r\nautomatic brake in 1872, and his quick-action freight train brake in\r\n1887, while in 1892 he introduced his high-speed brake for express\r\ntrains. Up to the opening of 1899, the Westinghouse brake had been\r\napplied to about 55,500 locomotives and 912,000 cars, of which 34,300\r\nlocomotives, 50,000 passenger cars and 750,000 freight cars were on\r\nAmerican railways. With this brake, a passenger train of 300 tons,\r\ntraveling at 60 miles per hour, can be stopped in about 4500 feet\r\nand about 90 seconds, or in 1200 feet and 31 seconds in case of\r\nemergency. A freight train of 800 tons, running at 30 miles per hour,\r\ncan be stopped in about 950 feet in 32 seconds, or in 300 feet and 11\r\nseconds by an “emergency” application. Very few countries have applied\r\ncontinuous brakes to freight cars, except the United States and Canada,\r\nand (to some extent) Russia and New South Wales.\r\n\r\nThe improvement in train service has been even greater than that in\r\ntrain equipment, and this improvement has been in speed, accommodation,\r\nand number of trains. Among the notable runs are those across the\r\nAmerican and European continents. The Canadian Pacific Railway starts\r\na train daily from each end of the line for a through run of 2900\r\nmiles. In 1888, a through train service (with sleeping and dining\r\ncars) was instituted between Paris and Constantinople, about 1800\r\nmiles, and through trains are run twice a week between Paris and St.\r\nPetersburg, 1600 miles. There is also a similar service between Calais\r\nand Brindisi, 1200 miles, in connection with the mail steamers between\r\nEngland and India. In 1898, the Trans-Siberian Railway was completed to\r\nIrkutsk, and a through train service between St. Petersburg and that\r\ncity, 3230 miles, was commenced.\r\n\r\nRailway trains were at first intended to have speeds of about 10 to 20\r\nmiles per hour, the latter being looked upon as almost excessive, but\r\nmuch higher speeds were very soon attained. There has been almost from\r\nthe earliest days a public demand for higher and higher speeds, with\r\nconsequent rivalry between the railways. The United States and Great\r\nBritain (and France within the past few years) have the fastest trains\r\nand by far the greater number of fast trains. The highest recorded\r\ntrain speed is that of the Exposition Flyer, 270 tons total, upon the\r\nNew York Central Railway, May 10th, 1893. It ran a distance of one\r\nmile at the rate of 112 miles per hour, and again, on the same date,\r\nmaintained a speed of 100 miles per hour, through a distance of five\r\nmiles. As a daily train between New York and Chicago, it maintained\r\na rate of 60 to 75 miles an hour, throughout the entire 980 miles of\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RAILWAY SUSPENSION BRIDGE, NIAGARA FALLS.]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the speed of “100-miles-an-hour,” which is\r\npopularly looked upon as a sort of ideal, has been more than once\r\nexceeded, but it may be well to explain that such spectacular bursts\r\nof speed are really less important and less wonderful than the trips\r\nof 50 to 1000 miles at speeds averaging 50 to 65 miles per hour for\r\nthe entire journey. Taking into account the loss of time by stops at\r\nstations, by changing engines, by the resistance of long grades,\r\netc., it will be easily understood that in order to maintain the\r\naverage speed from start to finish, the actual speeds must often\r\nrange from 60 to 75 or even 80 miles per hour. The regular daily\r\ntranscontinental train of the Canadian Pacific Railway has an average\r\nspeed of 30 miles per hour, but maintains this for the trip of 2906\r\nmiles, which occupies 94½ hours. This is a train and a record of which\r\nrailway men in general, and those of the Canadian Pacific Railway in\r\nparticular, may well be proud. There are no such through trains in the\r\nUnited States, but in 1876 a special theatre train was run from New\r\nYork to San Francisco in 3 days 7⅔ hours. In 1889, the time of the\r\ntranscontinental mails was 5 days 8¼ hours, but that same year it was\r\nreduced to 4 days 12¾ hours, which schedule continued in force until\r\n1899. On January 1, 1899, a new mail service was inaugurated, making\r\nthe 3408 miles in 98½ hours, or at an average of 34½ miles per hour,\r\nincluding all stops, and the transfer of mail bags across Chicago by\r\nwagon from one station to another. The actual running speed is often 60\r\nto 75 miles per hour for long stretches. Engines are changed 18 times\r\nand postal crews 7 times.\r\n\r\nFast passenger trains are a popular attraction, but only railway men\r\ncan fully appreciate the advantages and economies of heavy trains for\r\nhandling freight traffic. In Europe coal trains weigh from 300 to 400\r\ntons, but in the United States the weight of coal, ore, and freight\r\ntrains is from 800 to 2000 tons. Automatic couplers and power brakes\r\nenable the freight trains to be run as fast as passenger trains, with\r\nentire safety; improved cars carry greater loads, and more powerful\r\nlocomotives are continually being put in service to haul heavier\r\ntrains. The heaviest trains on record are as follows: (1) Pennsylvania\r\nRailway, 130 cars, 5213 tons, or 5560 tons with engine and tender; (2)\r\nNew York Central Railway, 81 cars, 3478 tons, or 3595 tons with engine\r\nand tender. Both these were run in 1898, the length of journey being\r\n160 and 140 miles.\r\n\r\nThe mails were carried by rail between Baltimore and Washington in\r\n1834, on recommendation of the Postmaster-General. The U. S. railway\r\nservice was instituted in August, 1864, between Chicago and Clinton,\r\nand the following figures indicate its wonderful development:—\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------+------------+-------------\r\n                                 |    1880    |    1898\r\n  -------------------------------+------------+-------------\r\n  Mileage run by mail cars       | 65,763,993 | 187,483,187\r\n  Number of mail cars            |     ——     |       3,649\r\n  Number of mail clerks          |      2,946 |       7,999\r\n  Miles of railway operated over |     85,320 |     174,777\r\n  Tons of mail carried           |    368,000 |   1,432,050\r\n  -------------------------------+------------+-------------\r\n\r\nThe railway express business was started in 1838 by Mr. W. F. Harnden,\r\non a suggestion from Mr. Josiah Quincy, who had to travel weekly from\r\nBoston to New York, and was in the habit of taking small packages for\r\nbusiness acquaintances. Mr. Alvin Adams became associated with Mr.\r\nHarnden, and in 1845 formed the Adams Express Co. In Great Britain,\r\nthis business is conducted by the parcels-post and the railway\r\ncompanies, but in other European countries it is mainly in the hands of\r\nthe post-office department.\r\n\r\nA very remarkable feature of railway development is that from the\r\nbeginning there has been a tendency to increased traffic, better\r\nservice, and a steady reduction in rates. In the United States the\r\naverage rates per mile since 1867 have been as follows:—\r\n\r\n  -----+------------+----------\r\n       | Passenger, | Freight,\r\n  Year |   cents    |  cents\r\n  -----+------------+----------\r\n  1867 |   1.994    |  1.925\r\n  1870 |   2.392    |  1.889\r\n  1875 |   2.378    |  1.421\r\n  1880 |   2.442    |  1.232\r\n  1885 |   2.216    |  1.011\r\n  1890 |   2.167    |  0.941\r\n  1895 |   2.040    |  0.839\r\n  1896 |   2.019    |  0.806\r\n  -----+------------+----------\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAGERMAN PASS ON COLORADO MIDLAND R. R.]\r\n\r\nWhile the reduction in passenger rates has been comparatively small,\r\nit must be remembered that the safety, speed, comfort, and service\r\nhave greatly improved. The marked reduction in freight rates has been\r\nmade possible only by a still greater and more remarkable reduction in\r\nthe cost of transportation. This has been effected by consolidation\r\nof companies, by improvements in roadway, bridges, etc., and by the\r\nintroduction of heavier trains, with engines of greater power and cars\r\nof greater capacity. This economy can be still further extended. The\r\nreduction in rates has been much greater than that in the prices of\r\ncommodities. Rates for wheat and hay, for instance, have decreased 23\r\nand 20 per cent more than the market prices, and the rate for shipping\r\nanthracite coal to tidewater has decreased 50 per cent in the past ten\r\nyears, while the price of the coal has decreased only 10 per cent. The\r\naverage freight rate on the Pennsylvania Railway in 1898 was 0.536\r\ncent per ton per mile, while the cost was 0.369 cent. The cheapness of\r\ntransportation in the United States is shown by the following figures\r\nfor 1898:—\r\n\r\n  Passengers carried one mile                             13,000,000,000\r\n  Tons of freight carried one mile                        95,000,000,000\r\n  Revenue from passenger service                             $26,000,000\r\n  Revenue from freight service                               $62,000,000\r\n  Distance railway carries 1 passenger to earn $1 profit       500 miles\r\n  Distance railway carries 1 ton to earn $1 profit            1530 miles\r\n  Average profit per passenger (including baggage) per mile    2-10 cent\r\n  Average profit per ton per mile                              1-15 cent\r\n\r\nThe lowest passenger rates in the world are on the Indian railways. In\r\nEurope the passenger rates average higher than in the United States,\r\nthough the accommodation is inferior.\r\n\r\nRailway transportation has almost entirely superseded barge, canal,\r\nand river transportation, except in special cases. This is due to the\r\ngreater speed, the greater efficiency of service, the greater carrying\r\ncapacity, and the extent to which spurs and branches are built to\r\nenable cars to reach mills, factories, and other industrial plants. It\r\nwas for a long time held that the low rates of water transportation\r\nexerted an influence in keeping railway rates down, but with the\r\npresent condition of the latter this no longer holds good as a general\r\nproposition, especially for the limited capacity of barge canals.\r\nThe rates established for wheat and corn from Buffalo to New York by\r\nrail in 1899 are about 0.23 and 0.18 cent per ton per mile, which is\r\nbut little above the canal rates, while rail shipments are much more\r\nadvantageous.\r\n\r\nThe railway system is a vast employer of labor, directly and\r\nindirectly, and several million persons in the United States derive\r\ntheir support from the various railway industries, without taking into\r\naccount such allied industries as rail mills, bridge works, locomotive\r\nworks, and car works, etc. The number of direct railway employees\r\n(exclusive of the employees of terminal and sleeping-car companies,\r\nfast freight lines, etc.) is over 820,000, or over 1.2 per cent of the\r\ntotal population. A large proportion of these represent skilled labor\r\nof a high degree of intelligence. France has about 1110 employees per\r\nmile of railway, and 10 per cent of these are women. The figures for\r\nthe United States and Great Britain are as follows:—\r\n\r\n  -----------------------+-----------------+--------------------------\r\n                         |  United States  |       Great Britain\r\n                         +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------\r\n                         |  1890  |  1897  |  1857  |  1889  |   1895\r\n  -----------------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------\r\n  Miles of railway       |163,597 | 184,428|   8,942|  19,943|  21,174\r\n  Number of employees    |749,301 | 823,476| 109,660| 381,626| 465,412\r\n  Number of employees per|        |        |        |        |\r\n    100 miles            |    479 |     449|   1,230|   1,900|   2,197\r\n  Number of employees per|        |        |        |        |\r\n    cent of population   |    1.2 |     1.2|     0.4|     1.0|     1.2\r\n  -----------------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------\r\n\r\nThe railway service especially demands some better and more intimate\r\nrelation between the employers and employees than that of the\r\nmere buying and selling of labor for a price. Both humanity and\r\nself-interest have led several railways in this country and abroad to\r\nestablish relief departments, providing temporary financial aid in case\r\nof accident or sickness, with other forms of benefits in addition, the\r\nobject being to induce men to continue permanently in the employ of the\r\nroad. Such associations have existed in England since 1850, in Canada\r\nsince 1873, and in the United States since 1880, when one was started\r\nby the Baltimore & Ohio Railway. In 1896 there were six of these\r\nassociations in the United States, with an aggregate of about 125,000\r\nmembers. The six railway systems owned 15 per cent of all the mileage\r\nand had 20 per cent of all the railway employees in the country.\r\n\r\nBefore closing this review of railway development, brief reference may\r\nbe made to certain special classes of railways.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW NEAR VERRUGAS, ON LINE OF OROYA RAILWAY, PERU.]\r\n\r\nMOUNTAIN RAILWAYS.—These include lines either isolated or forming part\r\nof main lines, having grades so steep as to require special means of\r\ntraction. They may be operated by (A) cables, (B) grip rails, or (C)\r\nrack rails. Cables are used for many short lines, but are now rarely\r\nadopted for regular railway working. The grip rail system was first\r\nused on the Mont Cenis railway in 1867, and has been used in later\r\nyears in Brazil and New Zealand. Rack rails were used in 1848 on the\r\nincline near Madison, Indiana (U. S. A.). In 1866 they were used on the\r\nMount Washington railway (U. S. A.), (with the Marsh rack), this being\r\nthe first mountain-climbing railway. In 1885, the Abt rack-rail system\r\nwas introduced, and is a great improvement. It has been used both for\r\nordinary railway service and for special mountain lines.\r\n\r\nRAPID TRANSIT.—Street or surface railways for city traffic date\r\nfrom 1831, in New York, and were operated by horses until 1873, when\r\ncable traction was introduced. Electric traction was introduced in\r\nGermany in 1881 and in the United States in 1884, and the growth\r\nof this system was such that in 1894 it was in use on 9000 miles in\r\nthis country and 195 miles in Europe. Locomotives operated by steam,\r\ngas, compressed air, etc., have been used to a limited extent. For\r\nhigh speeds it was necessary to remove the railway from the street\r\nsurface. The first elevated railway was built in New York in 1869, and\r\nnow New York, Brooklyn, and Chicago have about 100 miles, operated\r\nby electricity and steam. The only foreign railway on this system is\r\nat Liverpool (England), the line being 5 miles long, and operated by\r\nelectricity. The first underground railway was opened in London in\r\n1863, and that city now has several miles of such railway, mostly\r\noperated by steam locomotives. Two underground electric lines are in\r\noperation and another is being built. Budapest (Hungary) and Boston\r\n(Mass.) have also underground electric railways. New York has for\r\nyears needed and demanded a railway of this character, but political\r\nmethods and extravagant demands for franchise rights have prevented the\r\ncommencement of work upon the line.\r\n\r\nMILITARY RAILWAYS.—Railways cannot be made available to any extent for\r\ntactical purposes, but are of great importance as a means of supply\r\nand communication. They were used by the Russians in the Crimean war\r\n(1854), and were prominent features in some of the campaigns of the\r\nAmerican Civil War (1861–65). In the Franco-German war (1870), the\r\nGerman army advancing on Paris was closely followed by a military\r\nrailway, and in the Soudan campaign of 1898–99, the British army\r\ncarried with it the head of a railway communicating with the base of\r\nsupplies on the Nile.\r\n\r\nPORTABLE RAILWAYS.—These are narrow-gauge lines of light construction,\r\nfor use on plantations, in lumbering operations, on engineering\r\nconstruction works, and for pioneer railways. The rails are riveted to\r\nsteel ties, forming complete sections of track, straight or curved,\r\nwhich can be laid down, taken up, or shifted, as required. Such a line,\r\nof 24 inches gauge, was used to carry passengers around the grounds of\r\nthe Paris Exhibition of 1889.\r\n\r\nSHIP RAILWAYS.—These are projected as substitutes for ship canals, but\r\nnone have been built in modern times, if we except a few small ones\r\nfor canal boats, including one at the Columbia River rapids, in Oregon\r\n(U. S. A.). One was proposed for the Isthmus of Suez in 1860, and in\r\n1879 Captain Eads strongly advocated one across Tehuantepec (Mexico),\r\nto connect the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. This line would be about\r\n150 miles in length, and the cost is estimated at $50,000,000. In 1888\r\nwork was commenced on the Chignecto ship railway (Canada), at the head\r\nof the Bay of Fundy, but it has never been completed. The general\r\nprinciple of the system is to float the ship into a dock and deposit it\r\nupon a wheeled cradle of suitable form. This would then be raised by\r\nmachinery and hauled along the railway by a number of locomotives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADVANCE IN LAW AND JUSTICE\r\n\r\nBY LUTHER E. HEWITT, L.B.,\r\n\r\n_Librarian of Philadelphia Law Association_.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. INTERNATIONAL LAW.—Exclusive rights asserted in past centuries have\r\nbeen succeeded by freedom of the seas and privileges on the rivers.\r\nThe principle back of the American guns off the Barbary coasts has\r\nprevailed. Crimes of one country against another are punishable in\r\neither. Extradition for nonpolitical crimes is general. Expatriation\r\nhas been won for those who would change their country. Internal\r\naffairs of countries are free from interference; but a rule may be\r\nso revolting, or so hurtful to foreign interests, as to justify\r\nintervention. The Monroe doctrine was intimated in the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, and has developed with our country. Regard for other\r\nnations has increased. Protectorates and spheres of influence are\r\nrespected, while recognition of insurgent States will not be hurried.\r\nDevastation and weapons causing needless pain are condemned, while\r\nguerillas are regulated by requirement of a responsible head, a badge\r\nrecognizable at a distance, and subjection to rules of war. The sick\r\nand wounded, attendants, and appliances are protected from intentional\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nOpen, unfortified places are in practice spared, and ransoms no\r\nlonger extorted. Twenty-four hours are allowed for withdrawal of\r\nnoncombatants from places to be attacked. Military occupation no longer\r\nconfers sovereign power; and compensation on the closing of war has\r\nbeen recommended for private property of an enemy used in military\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nImpartial neutrality is demanded. Nations once bound themselves for\r\ntroops in case others went to war. This has ceased. Passage of troops\r\nthrough neutral territory is not allowed. Even sick and wounded will\r\nbe denied if their passage would relieve a combatant’s own lines; but\r\nneutrals have interned such refugees. The neutral cannot allow fitting\r\nout of armed expeditions or enlistment of troops. Jefferson advanced\r\ninternational law by demanding Genet’s recall for such offenses.\r\nCarriage of signals, dispatches, or persons in military operations is\r\nunneutral, and the United States insisted that this ruled the Trent\r\naffair. A belligerent’s ship of war can remain in port but twenty-four\r\nhours, unless in an emergency, like need of repairs. Coal will be\r\nafforded only to the nearest port, nor will a new supply be furnished\r\nwithin three months. Statutes enforce some of these rules. Neutral\r\ntrade is not lost except on blockade, although goods which may be put\r\nto military uses are liable to seizure as contraband. “Free ships,\r\nfree goods,” was long contended for; and at last the Declaration of\r\nParis, in 1856, provided even further, as follows: (1) Privateering\r\nis and remains abolished. (2) The neutral flag covers enemy’s goods,\r\nwith the exception of contraband of war. (3) Neutral goods, with the\r\nexception of contraband of war, are not liable to capture under an\r\nenemy’s flag. (4) Blockades, in order to be binding, must be effectual.\r\nSpain, Mexico, Venezuela, and the United States declined to adhere to\r\nthe Declaration. The United States adopted 2, 3, and 4, and offered\r\nto agree to the abolition of privateering if noncontraband property of\r\nthe enemy were exempted under its own flag. The United States and Spain\r\nrefrained from privateering in the recent war. Private property of the\r\nenemy on land has long been exempt from capture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INDEPENDENCE HALL AND SQUARE. WINTER SCENE.]\r\n\r\nII. LAW-MAKING BODIES.—State legislators were originally chosen from\r\nlanded proprietors, except, perhaps, in Pennsylvania. Legislatures\r\nfrequently had the selection of governors, judges, and other high\r\nofficials, but the Ohio constitution in 1802 foreshadowed the coming\r\ndemocracy. Distrust has followed reliance on legislatures. Their\r\nsessions have been limited in about half the States to an average\r\nof less than ninety days, and almost everywhere made biennial.\r\nIncrease of the members’ own compensation is forbidden. Their duties\r\nare carefully prescribed. Common requirements are, reading of\r\nbills on three days; one subject for a bill, and that expressed in\r\ntitle; recital of old law, upon revision; prohibition of riders on\r\nappropriations. Nearly half the States require a majority in each\r\nhouse of all members elected thereto. Constitutional restrictions\r\non state and municipal indebtedness and loan followed the burdens\r\nassumed in the first exultation over inventions in transportation. The\r\nPennsylvania constitution, for instance, prohibits “local or special\r\nlaws” in about thirty cases, such as in municipal affairs, descent of\r\nproperty, judicial proceedings, remitting penalties, exemption from\r\ntaxation, regulating labor, chartering corporations. Boundaries between\r\nlegislative and judicial proceedings have been simplified; special\r\nlegislation in marriage and divorce has been forbidden; appellate\r\njurisdiction has been taken from Senates once possessing it. The\r\nBritish House of Lords retains such jurisdiction, but within it sit the\r\ngreat judges, and the lay lords almost never vote on appeals.\r\n\r\nPayment of expenses of members was derived from England, and although\r\nabandoned there has continued here. Members of Congress give\r\nattendance remote from home, so that they receive salaries rather than\r\ncompensation. Sums for expenses are allowed in the other American\r\nrepublics, in France, Australia, Sweden, Switzerland, chiefly in the\r\nlower houses. Some are paid by the local constituency, but this tends\r\nto create classes. Representatives to Congress were generally elected\r\nat first on the State ticket, and in some States this continued until\r\nthe Congress in 1872 required district election. The Revised Statutes\r\nappoint the day of their election, and require a printed or written\r\nballot.\r\n\r\nIII. THE COURTS.—A feature of American jurisprudence which excites the\r\nwonder of foreigners is the power in the courts to declare legislative\r\nor executive acts void because unconstitutional. Before the Revolution\r\nthe Rhode Island court struck down a statute contrary to the provincial\r\ncharter; and a recent instance is the decision of the U. S. Supreme\r\nCourt on the income tax. The power is exercised on individuals,\r\nwithout direct conflict between the great departments of government.\r\nThe judicial power has otherwise widened. Civil trials without jury\r\nare frequent. In the counties judges exercise much administrative\r\npower. Road and bridge cases, grants of liquor licenses, appointments\r\nto educational and other offices, are illustrations. In what has been\r\ntermed “government by injunction,” functions both of the executive and\r\nof the jury have been assumed. Perhaps this justifies the demand that\r\nall judges shall be elected by the people. Frequently the choice of\r\njudges was originally by the legislature, or by the governor, alone\r\nor with the approval of the senate. The judicial tenure of office\r\nhas generally been lengthened to a term insuring a long service. In\r\nPennsylvania, a supreme court judge holds office twenty-one years,\r\na county judge ten years. Age limit prevails in some States. In a\r\ndemocracy, it is not surprising to find the doctrine sometimes asserted\r\nthat juries in criminal cases are judges both of law and fact. In\r\ncertain civil cases, the jury is a crude but powerful engine for\r\nholding corporations to strict responsibility for the citizens’ safety,\r\nalthough excessive or unfounded verdicts are to be deplored. Much of\r\nthe old law of deodands has force to-day in subtler form. A feature to\r\nnote in passing is the duty imposed on the judge to answer before the\r\njury points of instruction framed by counsel.\r\n\r\nIV. CIVIL PROCEDURE.—Twenty-nine States and Territories rejoice\r\nin escape from puzzling classifications by substitution of simple\r\nstatements. Extreme separation of law and equity had made the old\r\ncondition worse. Equity might often soften legal principles, or\r\nlaw lend vigor to equity. Much of this has now been done; had been\r\ndone, in fact, in Pennsylvania, from early days. Its enforcement of\r\nequitable rights through remedies at law was largely followed in the\r\nEnglish Judicature Act of 1873 abolishing forms of actions at law and\r\ninterblending law and equity. This statute has been copied largely in\r\nBritish colonies. England abolished the cumbrous system of real actions\r\nin 1834, and substituted simpler remedies for assertion of title.\r\n\r\nThe simplicity of present procedure is accompanied by ability to reach\r\ndecision more promptly, and an old reproach has been greatly lessened.\r\n\r\nV. CODIFICATION.—The New York Revised Statutes of 1828 embraced\r\nnearly the entire civil procedure, and in 1848 a “Code of Procedure”\r\nwas adopted, although the original draftsman, David Dudley Field,\r\ncomplained bitterly of changes. Forty-two States now have more or less\r\ncomplete codes of practice; and criminal codes likewise are numerous.\r\nCodification of the branches of substantive law may be anticipated.\r\nSomething of this is going on in England. The Bill of Sales Act, the\r\nEmployers’ Liability Act, the Bills of Exchange Act, the Public Health\r\n(Scotland) Act of 1897, the Land Transfer Act of the same year, are\r\ninstances. In Pennsylvania, there are codelets like the Evidence Act\r\nof 1887, or the Building Law for Philadelphia of 1893. Instances\r\ncould be multiplied. A code intended for all the States on Negotiable\r\nInstruments has been prepared by commissioners, and has been adopted in\r\nNew York, Connecticut, Colorado, and Florida. In Great Britain there\r\nhas not been general codification, whereas the continental systems run\r\nlargely that way, even in substantive law, being based on the Roman law.\r\n\r\nVI. CRIMINAL JURISPRUDENCE.—The grand jury is no longer grand in\r\nmany States; indeed, less than twelve members suffice in some;\r\nand their service may even be dispensed with under some Western\r\nconstitutions. Individual malice has been avoided by the creation of\r\npublic prosecuting attorneys. “Standing aside jurors” resulted from\r\n33 Edward I., denying government challenge except for cause. It has\r\nbeen generally abolished, and the prosecution equalized by a number\r\nof peremptory challenges. Pennsylvania retains the old practice.\r\nPrisoners may now testify, but refusal is not to weigh against them.\r\nThe statute 7 William III. allowed counsel in treason cases, but\r\nEngland did not extend the privilege to trials for other felonies until\r\n1836. The courts in mitigation permitted counsel to prompt prisoners\r\nwith questions. Penn’s charter gave prisoners privileges of witnesses\r\nand counsel, and this is now universal in American constitutions.\r\nMany States provide counsel for prisoners without means, some with\r\ncompensation. “Standing mute” has become equivalent to a plea of not\r\nguilty. Unanimity in a verdict is essential to conviction of crime\r\nabove misdemeanor, except in Utah, and there it is limited to capital\r\ncases. In civil and in minor criminal cases about a dozen constitutions\r\nin the far West or Southwest either recognize verdict by proportion\r\nof jury or else empower the legislature so to do. England refuses\r\ncriminal appeals, but in this country they are allowed. The courts of\r\nthis country have never been subservient to military passion, and all\r\nfriends of the great French Republic must rejoice at the courage of\r\nthe Court of Cassation in the Dreyfus case. The English law inflicted\r\ndeath for 160 crimes, some great and many otherwise, about the period\r\nof our Revolution, and in 1819 this number had become 200. American\r\njurisprudence never had such stain of blood, yet 10 crimes were\r\npunishable with death in Massachusetts, and 20 in Delaware, at the time\r\nof the Revolution, and the pillory, stocks, shears, branding-irons, and\r\nlash were busy. Horrible prisons existed, filled with every foulness\r\nand immorality. The older penitentiary system has been modified in 20\r\nStates by the parole system under police supervision, and in 4 the\r\npolicy of indeterminate sentences within fixed limits and ages has been\r\nadopted. Bertillon and other methods of identification have greatly\r\nlessened crime in England. The law of deodand, whereby the value of\r\nan object causing accidental death was forfeited for charities, was\r\nabolished in England in 1846. Societies to prevent cruelty to children,\r\nor to animals, attest the advance of refinement and humanity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HON. MELVILLE W. FULLER.\r\n\r\n(Chief Justice U. S. Supreme Court.)]\r\n\r\nVII. CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.—In England, treason and felony, except petty\r\nlarceny and mayhem, were punishable with death. The fiction by which\r\nmales who could read were supposed to be of the clergy saved first\r\noffenders, who escaped with branding. In the eighteenth century, the\r\nfiction was forbidden, and death imposed on additional offenses, so\r\nthat 160 crimes were so punishable. In 1826, the efforts of Sir Samuel\r\nRomilly and Sir James Mackintosh, and later of Sir John Russell,\r\nresulted in a more merciful spirit, and since 1861 murder, treason, and\r\nfiring of the great dock yards, have been the only capital offenses.\r\nThe American colonies were more humane, yet Massachusetts punished 10\r\nand Delaware 20 crimes with death. Since the Revolution imprisonment\r\nhas been the general penalty. In Maine, Wisconsin, and Colorado\r\ncapital punishment has been abolished altogether; in Rhode Island,\r\nexcept where murder is committed by a life prisoner; in Michigan,\r\nexcept for treason. In some States, as in Ohio, the jury may avert the\r\ndeath penalty. New York and Iowa, after experiments, restored capital\r\npunishment. The federal law imposes death for murder, piracy, robbery\r\non the high seas, rape, treason. The introduction of degrees of murder\r\nhas reduced the number of executions. In New York, electrocution has\r\nbeen substituted for hanging. Capital punishment has been abolished\r\nor qualified in the Argentine Republic, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Costa\r\nRica, Guatemala, Holland, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Russia, Switzerland\r\n(in eight cantons), and in Venezuela.\r\n\r\nVIII. POLICE POWER.—The citizen of the present day is protected by the\r\npolice power to a degree which, perhaps, would have seemed marvelous a\r\ncentury ago. The sale of food is governed both in quality and quantity;\r\nbuilding laws prescribe yards for light and air, height and thickness\r\nof walls, and forbid wooden buildings in many populous centres.\r\nExplosives are placed under strict regulations. Health laws protect\r\nfrom impurity of food and from pestilence, establish quarantines,\r\ndeny the importation of rags, cattle, etc., likely to breed disease;\r\nmedicine, pharmacy, dentistry, and nursing are protected from\r\nignorance; immigration laws exclude persons or races deemed uncongenial\r\nor objectionable; railroads are subjected to provisions promoting\r\nsafety, comfort, and impartiality of service; lotteries, gambling,\r\nthreatening letters are forbidden; game laws preserve the various\r\nspecies from extinction; women and children are guarded by special\r\nlaws. Almost the entire body of this division of law is new to this\r\ncentury, and much of it is recent.\r\n\r\nIX. MARRIED WOMEN.—In 1800, a husband could appropriate his wife’s\r\npersonal property not held in trust, and use her realty while he\r\nlived. Except for necessaries or for her separate estate, she could\r\nnot contract. Her emancipation began in 1839, in Mississippi, and now\r\nher property, under the statutory interests secured to her by laws\r\ngenerally prevailing, is hers free from control or interference. This\r\nstatutory estate includes property inherited, or derived by purchase\r\nor gift, or in some States by labor. The wife’s power to contract has\r\nbeen extended, and in some States has little restriction beyond perhaps\r\ninability to become surety. Before this era, some States, acting on\r\na London custom, had allowed feme sole traders in cases of mariners’\r\nwives, or of desertion or neglect.\r\n\r\nX. CHILDREN.—Regulation of the labor of children in hours and\r\nemployments is usual, debarring them from workshops and factories at\r\ncertain ages and from occupations dangerous to their morals, as in\r\ntheatricals, circuses, rag picking, mendicancy, street music. Laws\r\nprohibit their entrance into gambling, or worse, houses, into pool\r\nrooms, or unaccompanied into dance or concert halls, roller rinks,\r\nvaudeville theatres. Minnesota excludes them from criminal trials. Sale\r\nof liquor to minors is prohibited. Numerous recent statutes prohibit\r\nsales of cigarettes, cigars, or tobacco, and Utah and West Virginia\r\nforbid sales of opium. Oregon and Rhode Island prohibit their public\r\nuse of tobacco. New Hampshire, Indiana, and Connecticut forbid children\r\nover three in almshouses. North Carolina makes it a misdemeanor to\r\nleave a child under seven, and unattended, exposed to fire. Prohibiting\r\nemployment inconsistent with school attendance is usual. Compulsory\r\neducation exists in twenty-nine States and two Territories, and largely\r\nthroughout Europe and the colonies. Fourteen is the more frequent limit\r\nof age. Children’s welfare now determines their custody, rather than\r\nthe rights of either parent. Laws in some States protect children more\r\nor less from wills made before their birth by parents. Many States\r\nprovide that bastards may inherit from their mother or from each other,\r\nand she from them, and that their parents’ marriage legitimates them.\r\n\r\nXI. REAL ESTATE.—Ownership of land is no longer embarrassed by\r\njoint tenancies, nor need conveyancing resort to cumbrous fine and\r\nrecovery; while transfer has been further lightened by title companies\r\npending the adoption, likely, of the Torrens system of registration\r\nand certificate. Democracy has rejected distinctions of sex or age in\r\ninheritance, and the half-blood may share in many States after certain\r\ndegrees. Disability of aliens to hold lands has been removed in some\r\nStates, in others there are limitations in acres, value, or time, while\r\nin some disability ceases on declaration of intention to become a\r\ncitizen. The English doctrine of tacking, whereby ownership of earlier\r\nand later incumbrances cut out intermediate titles, mortgages, etc., is\r\ninconsistent with the American recording acts.\r\n\r\nXII. COPYRIGHT.—After printing became general, the author received\r\nsome, if inadequate, protection, in England through the Stationers’\r\nCompany, or sometimes through particular privilege; in continental\r\ncountries, through such privilege. The statute of Anne confined him to\r\nsuch years, etc., as it specified, and the courts have decided with\r\nhesitation that there was no copyright at common law. The statutory\r\nrights have varied. Since 1831 the copyright period in this country\r\nis 28 years, with 14 more if author, widow, or children are living at\r\nexpiration of first term; and in England since 1842 it is 28 years or\r\nauthor’s life, whichever is longer.\r\n\r\nThe first known copyright directed to an author was granted by Venice\r\nin 1491. In 1791 France allowed copyright to all dramatists, extending\r\nit in 1793 to authors in general. Countries in sympathy with France\r\nadopted the policy. Prussia in 1794 extended copyright to authors\r\nrepresented by publishers at the Frankfort and Leipzig book fairs.\r\nGeneral protection has now come about, aided by consolidation of\r\nEuropean states into great nations. International copyright began with\r\nseparate treaties; and the movement culminated in the Berne Convention\r\nof 1887, participated in by Germany, Belgium, Spain, France, Hayti,\r\nItaly, Switzerland, Tunis, Great Britain, Liberia. Authors resident\r\nin any country which was a party to the Convention may have copyright\r\nin the other countries. The United States did not join, although it\r\nhad and since has had treaties with a few nations exchanging such\r\nprotection. The International Copyright Law of 1891, however, protects\r\nforeign authors but not foreign publishers, it being required that the\r\nprinting shall be done in this country.\r\n\r\nXIII. ADMIRALTY.—The difference between the majestic rivers of\r\nAmerica and English streams was recognized in the case of “The Genesee\r\nChief,” wherein the Supreme Court rejected the English doctrine that\r\nadmiralty has no jurisdiction except on the seas or where the tides\r\nebb and flow. This has insured uniformity in the regulations of travel\r\nand commerce, and has protected such waters from local interference.\r\nInternational rules to prevent collisions at sea have been joined in\r\nby the United States. By acts of 1851 and 1884, Congress relieved\r\ninnocent shipowners of liability for merchandise destroyed by fire, and\r\nprovided that liability in case of collision, embezzlement by crew,\r\netc., shall not exceed the owner’s interest. The Harter Act of 1893\r\nprovides that on due diligence neither owners nor charterers shall be\r\nliable for faults in navigation or in management, nor for perils of the\r\nsea, defects in goods, etc., but prohibits agreements relieving from\r\nliability for injuries caused by neglect in fitting out, provisioning\r\nand manning the vessel, stowing the cargo, or in caring for or delivery\r\nof the same. Parliament, in 1890, protected seamen from commercial\r\ngreed by requiring load lines to be marked on vessels at a height fixed\r\nby the Board of Trade.\r\n\r\nXIV. CORPORATIONS.—The source of corporate life was formerly the king;\r\nto-day, the charters are virtually the general corporation law, and\r\nspecial incorporation is forbidden. For a season, minor amendments for\r\nparticular companies were tolerated, but constitutions are forbidding\r\neven these. Applications for charters must state such particulars\r\nas name, nature, and place of business, amount of stock, limit of\r\nindebtedness, number and names of directors. Annual reports must be\r\nlodged with the tax authorities.\r\n\r\nDoctrines respecting corporations have wonderfully changed. The\r\nDartmouth College case held that charters were contracts and could\r\nnot be impaired; and thereafter, by constitution or otherwise, the\r\nStates provided that all new charters should be subject to alteration\r\nor repeal, although even this does not authorize radical change\r\nof corporate character. American law has recognized advantage of\r\nfreedom in execution of corporate affairs. It has dispensed with the\r\nburdensome requirement of seal to contracts, and even in England the\r\ncorporate seal is unnecessary, unless in unusual transactions. The\r\nAmerican courts uphold negotiable notes and bonds given in authorized\r\nbusiness. The company is confined to the business for which it was\r\ncreated, although a cautious tolerance exists in respect to related\r\nenterprises; and mortgages may be acquired if for debts contracted\r\npreviously and not as a device. The old theory was that a company\r\ncould not be held for misfeasance, since it could not authorize its\r\nagents to commit wrong; but corporations are now held for many torts\r\nsanctioned by them, such as trespass, assault and battery, infringement\r\nof patents, negligence, and even fraud and libel. Exemplary damages may\r\nbe awarded against them. One or another kind has even been subjected to\r\nindictment, in cases of nuisance, violation of Sunday law, maintenance\r\nof disorderly house, habitual omission of lights or signals, etc.\r\nThey may be guilty of contempt. They may be punished by penalties and\r\nforfeitures.\r\n\r\nA corporation outside its own State cannot exceed either its own\r\ncharter or the power granted like companies of the other State.\r\nConnecting railways are sometimes adopted in each of several States,\r\nbut the parts remain foreign to each other as respects jurisdiction\r\nin the federal courts. Foreign corporations are subject to the police\r\npower, but not to interference by the State in their interstate\r\ncommerce, except Congress so authorizes. Companies not engaged in\r\ninterstate commerce nor in governmental service may have conditions\r\nplaced upon their entry into a State, and may be practically excluded\r\nby taxation. Property within the foreign State is alone taxable there,\r\nbut the value of the franchise may be considered. Usually, statements\r\nare required showing location of agent, names of officers, etc.\r\nContracts made before compliance are differently regarded, being void\r\nin some States, and only until compliance in some others, and in some\r\nnot void at all where penalty is imposed. Some States seek revenue by\r\nlax laws inviting outside companies. Thus, by Delaware law of 1899,\r\ncompanies need not oblige themselves to keep their original books nor\r\nhold their meetings there, assessment beyond subscription is forbidden,\r\nand taxation is light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STATE, WAR AND NAVY BUILDING, WASHINGTON, D. C.]\r\n\r\nIn 1825 and 1827 the free organization of trades-unions and banking\r\nassociations was authorized, and thus was introduced into English\r\njurisprudence the principle of free association familiar to the Roman\r\nRepublic. In 1838, but more especially in 1844, limited partnerships\r\nwith transferable shares were authorized by general law; and in 1862\r\nfreedom from liability beyond subscription was somewhat recognized.\r\nA form of partnership, _société anonyme_, has been known in France\r\nfor six hundred years, and by law of 1867 may be organized without\r\nspecial leave. The managers alone assume full responsibility, and the\r\nassociation bears now a company name. Germany adopted the principle of\r\ngeneral incorporation in 1870, as have the greater nations, excepting\r\nRussia and Austria.\r\n\r\nSo early as 1784 New York enacted a general incorporation law for\r\nchurches, and for libraries in 1796. In 1811, woolen, glass, and some\r\nother manufactures were thus favored. The principle widened out, was\r\nadopted elsewhere, and became quite general by 1850. Pennsylvania\r\nadopted the policy in 1874, although its religious, library and\r\ncharitable organizations had enjoyed such law since 1791.\r\n\r\nXV. RELIGION.—Scorned, lashed, thrown into prison, his tongue cut out,\r\nbanished to savage woods, such was the fate of the Massachusetts Quaker\r\namong the first settlers, and Roger Williams shared little better. A\r\nlong stride had been taken when, in 1691, the Massachusetts charter\r\nproclaimed liberty of conscience for all “except papists.” Then was\r\nthe brave and gentle Penn securing religious liberty to all confessing\r\none God. Yet much further progress was essential. Roman Catholics were\r\nexcluded from office except in New York and Maryland; while even in\r\nPennsylvania no Jew could sit in the legislature. Most of the States\r\nrequired some religious test for higher offices; Massachusetts allowed\r\nno voters or officials outside of the Congregational church; and church\r\nmembership was essential in Connecticut and New Hampshire. In 1776\r\nPennsylvania admitted to the legislature any who believed in God and\r\nin a future state of rewards and punishments. Massachusetts threw down\r\nthe barriers to office in 1780, except that until 1821 the governor\r\nshould be of the Christian faith; but office-holding was limited to\r\nProtestants in North Carolina until 1835, and in New Hampshire until\r\n1877. Jews received the same rights as other sects in Connecticut in\r\n1843, in Maryland in 1825. The Virginia Bill of Rights declared that\r\nall are entitled to the free exercise of religion, and a few years\r\nafterwards, in 1786, proclaimed further in words written by Jefferson\r\nthat religious opinions shall never affect civil capacities, and that\r\nno man can be compelled to support religious worship. The Lake region\r\nwas secured from molestation for religious sentiments by the Northwest\r\nOrdinance of 1787, and the Constitution not only secures all from such\r\ninterference by Congress, but prohibits religious test for federal\r\noffices or establishment of religion by Congress. South Carolina made\r\nthe Episcopal the State church in 1776, but dropped establishment\r\nin 1790. Support of religion was likewise abolished in Maryland in\r\n1810, but continued in Massachusetts until 1833; and New Hampshire\r\nauthorizes public Protestant teachers of religion. Maryland, Kentucky,\r\nand Tennessee exclude clergymen from office. Political hierarchies\r\nand polygamy are not within constitutional protections. Courts have\r\ndeclared Christianity part of the common law; but in present law its\r\nforce is in its principles. Christian institutions, in common with\r\nother religious or charitable agencies, are favored in policies and\r\nexemptions; and blasphemies, like railings in general, are forbidden.\r\nBible reading in public schools is generally discretionary with the\r\nschool board, although held illegal in Wisconsin; but religious garbs\r\nmay not be worn in such schools by teachers. A public hospital may not\r\nbe erected on sectarian ground.\r\n\r\nThe English corporation and test acts excluded from office all without\r\nthe established church, until 9 George IV.\r\n\r\nXVI. SUMMARY OF ADVANCE.—Increased respect for the rights of others,\r\nboth individually and as nations, characterizes the law of this\r\ncentury, and may be perceived in every direction. It has created a\r\nnew international law, developed democratic institutions at home and\r\nabroad, almost revolutionized criminal jurisprudence, extended the\r\npolice power in every direction, and secured freedom of conscience\r\nand separation of church and state. It has emancipated woman, thrown\r\na protecting care over children, and favored charities, asylums,\r\nhouses of refuge. Imprisonment for honest debts has been abolished,\r\nand the wretched sight of debtors imprisoned for paltry sums no\r\nlonger reproaches society. Homestead and exemption laws preserve the\r\nfamily. Honest bankrupts are again lifted up in hope. The legal means\r\nof settlement and recovery of rights has been greatly expedited.\r\nEngland has followed America in making lands assets for payment of\r\ndebts; and claims against the State have received recognition in some\r\nof the States and under act of Congress, and likewise in England.\r\nBarriers excluding persons as witnesses have been broken down, first\r\nin Connecticut in 1848, next in England in 1851, and now there is\r\nlittle exclusion unless the adversary has died. Something had been\r\ndone before in compelling answers to written interrogatories, but with\r\na weakness and lack of logic that should have ridiculed the whole\r\nexclusion. Promotion of uniformity of laws has engaged the attention\r\nof State commissioners, who have drafted a code concerning negotiable\r\ninstruments which has been adopted in four States. Constitutional\r\namendment has afforded an entire race opportunity to develop from\r\nthe low estate of slavery into such condition as the future shall\r\nmanifest. Questions of civil rights, due process of law, and of equal\r\nprotection and privilege, are constantly bringing State laws before the\r\nfederal courts, as do questions of interstate commerce. Anti-pool and\r\nanti-trust enactments mark both federal and State law, and lately have\r\nbroken up the alliance of the trans-Missouri transportation companies.\r\nInheritance and succession taxes were imposed in Pennsylvania in 1826,\r\nand now are found in some dozen States. The progressive feature, or\r\nincrease of rate with increase of estate, has been sustained by high\r\nauthority. Congress has imposed such taxes, but its power to do so is\r\nin dispute before the United States Supreme Court.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PORTIA AND BASSANIO.\r\n\r\n(Trial Scene from “Merchant of Venice.”)]\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the republic property requirements existed both\r\nfor office and for voting. New States came in with manhood suffrage\r\nestablished either by law or custom. Original States threw open the\r\npolls,—Maryland in 1810, Connecticut in 1818, New York in 1821,\r\nMassachusetts in 1822. The white labor of Virginia was denied the\r\nsuffrage in 1830, but gained it in 1850. Similar movement in England\r\nis marked by the Reform Bill of 1832; and now manhood suffrage is\r\nuniversal in Germany, France, and Greece, and wellnigh so in England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEVOLUTION OF BUILDING AND LOAN ASSOCIATIONS\r\n\r\nBY MICHAEL J. BROWN,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of Building Association League of Penna._\r\n\r\n\r\nI. GENERAL PRINCIPLES.\r\n\r\n“Do not forget to pay your dues to-night,” is an expression familiar\r\nto the occupants of fifty thousand Philadelphia homes, one hundred and\r\nfifty thousand Pennsylvania homes, and six hundred and fifty thousand\r\nhouseholds in the United States. This means that nearly seven hundred\r\nthousand families are contributing towards gaining homes of their own\r\nthrough Building and Loan Associations. The entire membership is nearly\r\nseventeen hundred thousand, of whom fully four hundred thousand are\r\nwomen and children.\r\n\r\nThe picture “Paying their Dues” is a representative one, and in\r\nPhiladelphia there are four hundred and seventy-five such gatherings\r\nevery year. The Philadelphia associations generally meet once every\r\nmonth, but in some parts of the State, and in other States, many\r\nsocieties meet weekly, so there are fully ten thousand such gatherings\r\nevery twelve months in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe women have shares in their own right, and the children are either\r\npaying dues for their parents or for themselves, the father or mother\r\nacting as trustee. The boys and girls know exactly what nights the\r\nassociations meet, and are generally on hand with their money long\r\nbefore the officers are ready to receive the funds and give receipts in\r\nthe pass books.\r\n\r\nWhat is the meaning of these gatherings? To enable every member to\r\nbecome his own landlord—to purchase homes for themselves, by paying\r\ntheir money into a joint concern for a few years until each one has\r\nsaved enough, with gains added, to buy a home, and in the meantime the\r\nentire receipts being loaned to the members to gain homes in advance of\r\nthe final reckoning or maturity of the shares.\r\n\r\nThe members have well learned the principle that money makes money if\r\nwell used, that if many pay rent for the benefit of the few, through\r\nthe building association the many may combine together so as to put the\r\nrents into their own pockets.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nFor convenience, “a share” is the payment of $1.00 a month, five shares\r\n$5.00, and so on. The final value of a share is arbitrarily fixed at\r\n$200. The money received is promptly loaned to the members, on which\r\nthe borrowers pay $1.00 per month interest on every $200 borrowed,\r\nuntil the final value of $200 is reached, which occurs in twelve years\r\nor less.\r\n\r\n  Payments        $144.00\r\n  Gains             56.00\r\n                  -------\r\n    Final value   $200.00\r\n\r\nA member may have borrowed $2000 from the association on ten shares\r\nof stock ($200 being the limit loaned on each share), and the shares\r\nhaving matured, or become worth $2000, his loan of $2000 is canceled\r\nand his home is free. The member who has not borrowed receives $200 in\r\ncash for every share he holds.\r\n\r\nThe building association in its simplest form, and as it existed in\r\nPhiladelphia for many years, took all its members in at one time, and\r\nthe members paid from $2 to $20 each every month until the shares\r\nmatured. At maturity all the borrowers received canceled mortgages, and\r\nthe non-borrowers cash for their shares, and the society then closed\r\nits affairs. Hundreds of such associations have wound up their affairs\r\nsuccessfully.\r\n\r\nVery many associations are now working on the permanent plan; that is,\r\nthey admit new members every six months or every year, the first set\r\nbeing the first to mature, and so on, one set going out every year and\r\na new batch coming in.\r\n\r\nEach series is a separate association so far as the dues are concerned,\r\nbut the total gains are divided so as to give each dues dollar invested\r\na like rate per cent per annum for the time of investment. There is\r\nreally no positive or final division of profits. The gains are kept\r\nin a lump sum, and the division is on paper only for the purpose of\r\nshowing the progress made towards maturity. When a set of shares\r\nmatures, its portion of the gain is taken from the accumulated profits\r\nand divided to the stock that has reached its final value.\r\n\r\nSome associations count all the loans as assets and all the dues and\r\ngains as liabilities. In such societies the borrower pays interest on\r\nhis full loan until the end, and gets credit for profit on his dues\r\nuntil one account cancels the other.\r\n\r\nOther associations, at the end of each year, deduct the dues paid in\r\nfrom the loans and charge interest on the net amount only of the loan.\r\nBy the latter system the borrowers’ payments decrease every year, but\r\nit requires a longer time to finally cancel the loan than by the former\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nWhen there is a demand for money, and more than one member is anxious\r\nto secure it, the funds are offered at auction, and the member who bids\r\nthe highest premium secures the prize.\r\n\r\nThe bidding is generally done by offering so many cents per share per\r\nmonth above the required interest. If a member secures $2000 at 10\r\ncents per share premium on ten shares, his monthly payments are:—\r\n\r\n  Dues per month          $10.00\r\n  Interest per month       10.00\r\n  Premium per month         1.00\r\n                          ------\r\n    Total                 $21.00\r\n\r\nThese payments continue until the shares mature. The dues are the\r\ncontributed capital, and the interest and premiums are the gains.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THEIR EARLY HISTORY.\r\n\r\nTheir early history in England seems to date back as far as 1781. In\r\nMr. Langford’s “Century of Birmingham Life” mention is made of certain\r\nproposals for establishing a society for building on lands belonging to\r\nWilliam Jennings, Esq. The society was organized by rules or articles,\r\nsimilar in some respects to those employed by the building societies of\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PAYING THEIR DUES.]\r\n\r\nDr. John Henry Gray, in his “History of the Laws, Manners, and Customs\r\nof the People of China,” describes some money-lending societies\r\nwhich seem to partake in some measure of the character of building\r\nassociations, at least in their coöperative and equitable features.\r\nHe tells us that these societies are called “Lee Woee,” and were\r\ninstituted by a person named Pong Koong, an official of great wealth,\r\nwho flourished 200 B.C. during the Han dynasty. The money was loaned to\r\nmembers and returned in monthly installments with interest. Each member\r\nwas compelled to contribute to the fund a sum equal to that which he\r\ncontributed at the first meeting. One of the rules was, “Each member\r\nshall deposit in a lottery box, placed on a table, a tender or bid for\r\nthe money, setting forth the rate of interest which he is disposed to\r\npay on the amount in question; that the tenders shall be taken out of\r\nthe box by the president, and the highest bidder takes the loan.” When\r\ntwo bids were alike the first bidder took the loan. A fine was charged\r\nfor non-payment of dues.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. AMERICAN ASSOCIATIONS.\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence other than that Frankford, now a part of\r\nPhiladelphia proper, saw the first building society that was organized\r\nin the United States. It was called the “Oxford Provident Building\r\nAssociation,” and was started in 1831, sixty-eight years ago. It\r\nclosed its affairs in June, 1841. The second Frankford society, of the\r\nsame name, was organized in February of 1841, and ran out in August,\r\n1852. Isaac Whitelock was president, Samuel Pilling treasurer, and\r\nIsaac Shallcross secretary, of the first association; and Henry Taylor\r\npresident, Isaac Shallcross secretary, and William Overton treasurer,\r\nof the second association.\r\n\r\nThe Holmesburg Building Association was organized in January, 1842,\r\nand closed its business satisfactorily to the members, June 25,\r\n1853. John B. Duff, a lumber counter by trade, was instrumental in\r\norganizing the first building society within the compactly built up\r\ncity of Philadelphia, in the year 1847. The name of the society was\r\nthe “Kensington Building Association.” The society issued five hundred\r\nshares of stock in one series, and wound up its affairs in ten years\r\nand two months after it was organized. The first advertisement of any\r\nbuilding and loan association, so far as can be ascertained, appeared\r\nin the Philadelphia “Public Ledger,” February 5, 1847, and called for\r\na meeting of the “Kensington.” Mr. Duff died in 1883, and a few months\r\nbefore that event he presented to the writer a document now known as\r\n“The Old Yellow Poster.” It is the call for the first building society\r\nin Old Philadelphia, a copy of which is herewith presented.\r\n\r\nMr. Duff seldom, if ever, held forth in public, but his efficient work\r\nwas done by taking individual cases and converting them to the benefits\r\nof obtaining homes for themselves. Frequently he has been seen on a\r\npile of lumber with chalk in hand, demonstrating a problem in building\r\nsociety arithmetic to converts to this system of saving.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MEETING!\r\n\r\n  KENSINGTON\r\n  BUILDING ASSOCIATION\r\n\r\nThe Subscribers being desirous of forming an Association for the\r\npurpose of assisting the members thereof in the erection of Dwelling\r\nHouses, or such other Real Estate as they shall deem most advantageous,\r\nhave concluded to hold a Meeting for that purpose\r\n\r\n  ON FRIDAY EVENING, 22D JAN’Y, 1847,\r\n  AT 7 O’CLOCK,\r\n  _At the Kensington Engine Hall_,\r\n  On Queen Street, above Marlborough St.\r\n\r\nWhere the objects of the Association will be laid before the Meeting.\r\nCitizens generally, are invited to attend.\r\n\r\n  Ralph Pilling,\r\n  Joseph Smith,\r\n  John Bierly,\r\n  John B.

Henry\r\nWard Beecher in a sermon said,—\r\n\r\n“I think that a young man who places before himself not a speculation,\r\nnot a fortune, but some object that he means to achieve, who selects\r\na particular piece of property that he would like to own, and aims\r\nsteadily at acquiring it and works diligently for it, and saves for\r\nit, will be almost sure to succeed. I will say that every young man in\r\na city, either through the instrumentality of a building association\r\nwhen there is one, or independently, when such an association does not\r\nexist, and when at last, having toiled and waited patiently, the debt\r\nis paid and the piece of property is earned, is a great deal richer\r\nthan the assessor knows him to be. The assessor goes around and puts\r\na valuation upon his property for the purpose of taxing it. But, ah,\r\nthose habits of industry and self-control; those wise measurings,\r\nwhich we call economy,—all these the man has gained over and above\r\nthe property. He has saved himself from a thousand temptations. He has\r\nprotected himself against remorseless vices, which would have gnawed\r\nout his marrow. And though you call it merely amassing property, it may\r\nbe amassing manhood. It is one step on the upward way.”\r\n\r\nState officials who closely examine the workings of these societies\r\nnever seem to tire in their praise. Superintendent Kilburn, of New\r\nYork, in his last annual report, refers to the conservative and\r\nhonestly managed building association as follows:—\r\n\r\n“During the past year associations of this class alone have returned to\r\nwithdrawing members dues and profits amounting to $8,014,039. During\r\nthe same period no less than fifty-seven associations were engaged\r\nin the payment of matured shares, and $829,752 were paid to members\r\nwho had faithfully continued payments through a series of years, and\r\nat last saw their confidence justified. But these sums are of small\r\nconsequence when we consider the comfortable homes that have been\r\nerected, and the families that have been permanently and comfortably\r\nhoused through the facilities for frugality and thrift, for self-denial\r\nand saving afforded by them. My attention was recently called to a\r\nvillage of the State in which it was said that nearly one-third of the\r\nhouses had been erected through the agency of a small local association.\r\n\r\n“Nor is this an exceptional case, unless the element of proportion be\r\ntaken into consideration. In nearly all the cities of the State, and in\r\nmany of the large villages, there are associations that are models of\r\ntheir kind, and are worthy of the admiration and support of every good\r\ncitizen.\r\n\r\n“Their educational influence, too, can hardly be over estimated.\r\nThe workingman who joins such an association takes part in the\r\nadministration of its affairs and learns his first lesson in finance\r\nfrom those of larger experience, and, who perhaps, touches elbow with\r\nthe lawyer, the merchant, and the minister as they discuss the safety\r\nof an investment, or proper amendment to the articles of association,\r\nand will not lend a ready ear to teachers of socialism, of class\r\nhatred, or of financial heresies.”\r\n\r\nAs shown elsewhere, the members of the New York societies have over\r\n$37,000,000 invested. The Building Association League of Pennsylvania,\r\nan organization of twenty-six years’ standing, composed of the\r\nmost active associations in the State, some years ago proclaimed a\r\n“Declaration of Principles,” from which we quote:—\r\n\r\n“The local building societies of the State of Pennsylvania are\r\ntrue coöperative organizations, transacting no business with the\r\npublic, and not amenable to laws affecting financial institutions\r\nthat have dealings with the public. They encourage thrift among the\r\nwage-workers, help to create taxable property in its best form—real\r\nestate, educate their members in business methods and teach them both\r\nhow to save and how to invest money.\r\n\r\n“By this service they have created a state police of tens of thousands\r\nof home owners, more efficient for the protection of life and property\r\nthan a standing army.\r\n\r\n“They have lessened the cost for the maintenance of alms-houses,\r\nprisons, and asylums, by teaching men and women to be self-helpful and\r\nself-reliant, and in that way have benefited the State to an amount far\r\nexceeding any sum that could be gathered by taxation.\r\n\r\n“The work of the societies is done gratuitously by the directors,\r\nand in no other way could they be maintained, the profits resulting\r\nfrom the services of men who, though they have never posed as\r\nphilanthropists, are engaged in the best kind of charity, helping men\r\nand women who help themselves.”\r\n\r\nJoseph H. Paist, a prominent Philadelphia building association expert,\r\nhas been president of the league since it was organized.\r\n\r\nOther States have leagues, and they are all combined as a National\r\nLeague, whose motto is “The American Home is the Safeguard of American\r\nLiberty.”\r\n\r\nAt certain intervals the national government, States, cities, and\r\nhundreds of industrial enterprises distribute earnings and accrued\r\ninterest to those entitled to the same. The vast sums of money\r\ndrawn out of thousands of banks and banking institutions represent\r\nmillions of dollars of canceled debts. Within a few days after these\r\ndistributions take place, at least nine tenths of this money finds its\r\nway back into the strong boxes that parted with it. One tenth of the\r\nmoney is, perhaps, held in the pockets of the people, to be gradually\r\ndisbursed for current needs until the next pay arrives. I do not\r\nremember having received a statement or statistical report referring to\r\nthe building association share in these distributions.\r\n\r\nTrue, there are no set dates for building societies to part with money,\r\nbut in Pennsylvania alone these coöperative companies distribute\r\n$20,000,000 annually in matured shares and withdrawals. This is no\r\ninsignificant sum. To-day their accumulated wealth (mostly savings of\r\npeople in the humbler ranks of life) is over $107,000,000, and in the\r\nUnited States fully $600,000,000. The annual outgo for canceled shares\r\nis about $100,000,000, or fully $8,000,000 every month.\r\n\r\nSince these associations were organized, quite one thousand five\r\nhundred million dollars have been returned to the members in the value\r\nof homes clear of debt and in cash for withdrawn and matured shares.\r\nDespite these vast disbursements, there has been a gradual increase in\r\ntheir assets from year to year.\r\n\r\nBeginning with one association in 1831, their number increased in a\r\nsmall way until probably not over two hundred societies existed in\r\n1800. From that date until the present moment it is estimated that over\r\n8000 have been organized throughout the land, increasing at a rapid\r\nrate every year, and leaving at present, after closing out a great\r\nnumber, nearly 5000 active associations distributed among the States as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n  --------------+------------+-------------+-------------\r\n                |   No. of   |             |\r\n      States.   | Societies. | Membership. |   Assets.\r\n  --------------+------------+-------------+-------------\r\n  Pennsylvania  |    1200    |   300,000   | $111,714,871\r\n  Ohio          |     761    |   297,787   |   99,770,161\r\n  Illinois      |     682    |   180,000   |   73,309,192\r\n  New Jersey    |     300    |   116,739   |   41,038,934\r\n  Indiana       |     492    |   137,510   |   37,624,418\r\n  New York      |     317    |   102,902   |   37,385,642\r\n  Massachusetts |     123    |    65,419   |   24,507,843\r\n  Missouri      |     255    |    49,462   |   22,497,700\r\n  California    |     138    |    19,153   |   17,938,100\r\n  Iowa          |      87    |    25,000   |    6,594,778\r\n  Michigan      |      70    |    20,497   |    6,495,307\r\n  Minnesota     |      69    |     9,000   |    4,260,666\r\n  Tennessee     |      34    |     6,166   |    3,771,354\r\n  Nebraska      |      68    |    11,821   |    3,554,788\r\n  Connecticut   |      15    |    11,208   |    3,243,935\r\n  Maine         |      33    |     8,230   |    2,912,963\r\n  Other States  |     228    |   281,284   |  104,320,367\r\n                |            |             +-------------\r\n      Totals    |    4872    | 1,642,178   | $600,941,019\r\n  --------------+------------+-------------+-------------\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that of the above named membership over 325,000 are\r\nwomen. Of the $600,000,000 of assets, at least $100,000,000 is a gain\r\ncredit to the sharer. It is believed that an average of at least three\r\nmembers of a family contribute toward the payment of the dues and\r\ninterest, and although seventeen hundred thousand names are on the\r\nbooks, nearly five million persons actually contribute.\r\n\r\nThese societies have done more to teach the people practical thrift\r\nthan any known device ever promulgated. Thrift is described as “good\r\nhusbandry, economical management in regard to property, success and\r\nadvance in the acquisition of property, increase of worldly goods,\r\nvigorous growth, as a plant.”\r\n\r\n“He is a good wagoner that can turn in a little room.”—Bishop J. Hall.\r\n\r\n“Economy is the parent of integrity, of liberty and of ease, and the\r\nbeautiful sister of temperance, of cheerfulness and health. Without\r\neconomy none can be rich, and with it few can be poor.”—Dr. Johnson.\r\n\r\nWhile these literary economical truths proclaimed in all ages by wise\r\nmen, which they themselves very seldom knew how to put into practical\r\nuse, have no doubt caused millions to think and wonder how to do it,\r\nthey, altogether, have not built half as many rounds in the practical\r\nladder of “thrift” as the poor workingman who successfully induces his\r\nnext door neighbor to save one dollar a month out of his _waste_ money,\r\nand with it subscribe for one share of stock in a well-managed building\r\nsociety. Building society advocates have done much inducing, but always\r\nin a practical way. They have not merely proclaimed that “economy is\r\nwealth;” that “the best security for civilization is the dwelling,” but\r\nthey have taken the arm of their friend and neighbor and have led him\r\nto the society meeting-room and shown him just how they saved their own\r\nmoney. They have also taken them into their own homes and told them,\r\n“This is my own home, paid for, or nearly so, through the aid of the\r\nbuilding society.” In this way lessons in the practical benefit of\r\nthrift are daily given.\r\n\r\n“Examples demonstrate the possibility of success,” said Colton many\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\nAlexander Dumas brought the matter home to the door of every man when\r\nhe said, “All the world cries, ‘Where is the man who will save us?\r\nWe want a man!’ Don’t look for this man, you have him at hand. This\r\nman—it is you—it is I—it is each of us.... How to constitute one’s\r\nself a man? Nothing harder if one knows not how to will it; nothing\r\neasier if one wills it.”\r\n\r\nIt would seem that building society advocates were created to teach men\r\nhow to will it. In this line of work they have certainly been eminently\r\nsuccessful. To what class of citizens do these advocates belong, good,\r\nbetter, or best? In the early history of these associations they were\r\norganized and almost wholly managed by mechanics and laboring men;\r\nmanaged honestly, conservatively, and successfully; and to this “class”\r\nbelongs the honor of organizing, conducting, and carrying to a point of\r\nmagnitude and usefulness, that commands the admiration of financiers\r\nthe world over, the building societies as conducted in Pennsylvania and\r\nother States.\r\n\r\nThe honest, thrifty home-seeker has proved himself to be the “best”\r\ncitizen so far as managing a building society is concerned. When\r\nfailures have occurred, the main causes have been the introduction\r\ninto the management of financial ideas emanating from the brains of\r\ntheoretical bankers and literary economists.\r\n\r\nThe man who works at the bench mending shoes has a better idea of\r\nwhat a dollar will do than the man who has at his command hundreds\r\nof thousands of dollars belonging to other people, but who never was\r\nblessed with the necessity of earning a real dollar by his own labor.\r\nThe conservative building society is one of good common sense and\r\nnot of class. It would be difficult to bankrupt a building society\r\nconducted by men endowed with honesty and good common sense. The\r\n“better citizen” is the man who spends less than he earns, pays his\r\ndebts promptly, would rather give his neighbor a dollar than steal a\r\ndollar from him, looks upon the home institution as holy and sacred,\r\nstrives to own a home of his own, obeys the laws and looks the world\r\nstraight in the face. This “class,” without a penny to begin with,\r\ncaused Philadelphia to be known the world over as “the City of Homes.”\r\n\r\nIn the many interesting cases of men redeemed from the habit of\r\nunthrift through the agency of building associations, and placed on\r\nthe road to moderate fortunes, there are sometimes two sides to the\r\nstory. One side is that related by the individual who has been saved\r\nfrom future poverty, and the other side that which could be related by\r\nthe wife and mother, if she did not prefer and really strive to hide\r\nfrom the outside world the life she had been leading, its trials and\r\ngloom. The man simply tells how many days in the week he preferred not\r\nto work, and how he never tried to save a penny. The wife could tell\r\nhow little the husband brought into the home in the way of money, and\r\nwhat her awful anxiety had been. One side is public property, for it\r\nis told by the husband for the purpose of inducing others to make a\r\nnew departure on the road to thrift and home-ownership. The other side\r\nis supposed to be sacred, but it is only a secret in a sense that it\r\nis not proclaimed. No man who is often voluntarily away from his work,\r\nhaving a “good” selfish “time,” spending the earnings of days of\r\nactual work, need imagine that his friends and neighbors are ignorant\r\nof what the life in his home is, for it is as plain to all as if the\r\nhouse was constructed of clear glass.\r\n\r\nEvery man of good health, who will make an honest and determined\r\neffort, has it in his power to change such a home as has been described\r\ninto a palace of joy, comfort, and happiness, and even beauty.\r\n\r\nThere are many thousands of men and women throughout the land who would\r\nnot to-day have their own roof over their heads but for the building\r\nsociety and the thrifty habits acquired through it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROW OF $1400 HOUSES.]\r\n\r\nThe officers and members of these societies are men who have, by\r\ndegrees, worked their way on the path to independence, and they are\r\nhighly respected by all who know them, and pointed out as examples by\r\ntheir neighbors.\r\n\r\nMembers of these societies, after becoming firmly established in\r\nthrifty habits, delight in relating their own experience as well as\r\nthat of others. There are thousands of interesting cases on record, of\r\nwhich samples are given below:—\r\n\r\nA short time ago, at a house of mourning, the members of the family\r\ncalled the writer’s attention to a girl about fifteen years of age, who\r\nhad volunteered her services to the family until after the funeral.\r\nThis remark was made: “Our case is sad enough (the death of a father),\r\nbut the child you saw at the door has a father who has been confined to\r\nthe house with a lingering illness. There are several younger children,\r\nand one girl older than the one you saw. The two girls have been\r\nworking in a mill, but on short time. Their case is sadder than ours,\r\nand they were the first to volunteer to help us.” The above is the sad\r\npart of the story, but there is a silver-lined side, since ascertained.\r\nThe father joined a building society some years ago and bought a house\r\nfor $2000, and while on his sick bed received a paid-up deed for his\r\nhome, the building society shares having matured.\r\n\r\nIt is now twenty years since a big, strong man, under the influence\r\nof strong drink, visited the office of a building society secretary\r\nand asked if a Mrs. —— had any shares in the society. The books were\r\nexamined and an affirmative answer was given. The next question was,\r\n“How much has been paid in on the shares?” Answer, “Three hundred and\r\nsixty dollars.” The inquirer brought his fist down on the secretary’s\r\ndesk and exclaimed:—\r\n\r\n“So it is true, is it? I will stop that game; that woman is my wife,\r\nand I have just heard that she is going to draw out the money and run\r\naway.”\r\n\r\nThe secretary measured the man, and, risking a fight, determined to\r\nhasten a climax.\r\n\r\n“So you are the husband of Mrs. ——, are you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I am.”\r\n\r\n“And you are drunk?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“How long have you been drinking?”\r\n\r\n“For a long time.”\r\n\r\n“Have you given your wife any money lately?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Have you given her any of the money in this society?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t think I have.”\r\n\r\n“Your wife takes in washing and goes out house-cleaning, does she not?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“You eat at home without paying anything towards the support of the\r\nhouse?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“You have nice children, and your wife takes good care of them?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“You admit that all this is true?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Now, will you answer me an honest question?”\r\n\r\n“I will.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you think that you are just the kind of a man that a good woman\r\nlike your wife would be justified in running away from?”\r\n\r\n“I do.”\r\n\r\nThe secretary asked who told him that his wife was going to run away;\r\nand he answered that it was a friend.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF $1400 HOUSES.]\r\n\r\nThe secretary then addressed him as follows:—\r\n\r\n“When your wife comes to the society, I have noticed that her hands\r\nwere sometimes split and bleeding from hard work, and I know that she\r\nis saving this money to keep you and the children from the almshouse.\r\nIn the first place, you should give up drinking and keep away from the\r\npeople who have been talking against your wife; and then I would advise\r\nyou to go home at once and tell all to your wife, and get down on your\r\nknees before her and ask her pardon.”\r\n\r\nTo the utter surprise of the secretary the man shook hands with him and\r\nemphatically gave his word that he would act on the advice given.\r\n\r\nNot the strangest part of the incident is that the advice was exactly\r\nfollowed. From that time until now the man has abstained from drink. As\r\nsoon as he got work he took shares in the society, and in a few years\r\nthree of his children had subscribed for shares. Only recently two of\r\nthe children withdrew shares to buy homes of their own. This is the\r\nkind of practical work done by every building society in every State\r\nin the Union, and the State as well as the entire country is the gainer\r\nby it.\r\n\r\nOf course it goes without saying that the building society knows no\r\nsecret plan for the payment of dues and interest greater than the\r\nborrower can afford. It does, however, point out a way for every man to\r\ngain a home of his own, but the price of the house must be in keeping\r\nwith his income. If this rule is not observed the result is almost\r\nalways failure to gain the desired object. It is an old saying that it\r\nis almost wise to go in debt for a home, but it is decidedly unwise to\r\ncontract for a home that requires every dollar of income to keep it up.\r\n\r\nEvery home buyer should allow himself some margin in order to provide\r\nfor the possible rainy day. The man who cannot save over twenty dollars\r\na month outside of actual living expenses commits a serious error when\r\nhe signs a contract requiring him to pay twenty-five dollars every four\r\nweeks. In doing this he robs himself first, and, second, is unfair to\r\nhis family. It would be to his advantage to place aside three or four\r\ndollars out of the twenty dollars named as a nest egg.\r\n\r\nThis applies in particular to the careful man, who has been taught in\r\nthe school of thrift. The man who has been unthrifty may be able (when\r\nhe graduates) to save thirty dollars a month even when he thinks he\r\ncannot save anything. Building society managers make it their business\r\nto warn the thrifty not to undertake too much, and also to lead the\r\nunsaving into habits of economy.\r\n\r\nOnly recently a judge on the bench said, “Such associations, when\r\nproperly conducted under judicious restrictions and management, are a\r\nhelpful blessing and encouragement to any community. But the ambitions\r\nand extravagance of some borrowing members place themselves in a\r\nburdensome condition.... Far better for the public, the associations,\r\nand their membership, that many small loans be made rather than a few\r\nin number and large in amount. Moderate homes and a moderate price\r\nshould be the criterion.... Their primary purpose was and should\r\ncontinue to be to promote industry, frugality, and saving, and convert\r\nthe shiftless and discouraged tenant into a self-reliant and contented\r\nhome-builder.”\r\n\r\nBuilding societies since their inception have supplied the means for\r\nhome purchasing, but these companies do not generally take any part in\r\nthe erection of houses. Most of the small homes in Philadelphia have\r\nbeen built by those engaged in the business of building houses for sale.\r\n\r\nHere is a picture of a row of houses containing seven rooms each. The\r\npurchase price is $1400 each. The lots are 14 feet wide and 60 feet\r\ndeep. The houses are brownstone and brick. They have good cellars,\r\nportable heaters, and range in kitchen, hot and cold water in kitchen\r\nand bathroom. On the first floor there are three rooms,—parlor,\r\ndining-room, and kitchen, and outside shed. Front door opens into\r\nvestibule; entrance to parlor from entry, and also from dining-room.\r\nTwo front bedrooms over the parlor, bathroom in centre, and\r\nsitting-room back of the bathroom. The dining-room extends over the\r\nwidth of the lot less stairway room, and receives light from skylight.\r\nThe kitchen has a window opening towards the back shed or backyard. A\r\nsmall toilet room occupies a small portion of the back shed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BUILDING ASSOCIATION BANQUET.]\r\n\r\nAny person known to be prompt in the payment of dues and interest\r\nmay purchase such a home by the payment of $200 in cash, and giving\r\na building society mortgage for the balance of the purchase-money,\r\nnamely, $1200.\r\n\r\nThe monthly cost would be about as follows:—\r\n\r\n  Monthly dues                 $6.00\r\n  Monthly interest              6.00\r\n                              ------\r\n      Monthly total           $12.00\r\n\r\nA fairly prosperous building society will mature its shares in twelve\r\nyears, and at the end of that period the home would be free from debt.\r\nDuring this time the borrower must pay taxes and water rent, amounting\r\nto some $25.00 per year. The total payments would be about as follows:—\r\n\r\n  First payment              $200.00\r\n  Dues and interest          1728.00\r\n  Taxes and water rent        300.00\r\n                            --------\r\n      Total                 $2228.00\r\n\r\nThis seems like a considerable sum of money for a house worth $1400.\r\nBut it must be remembered that the borrower has lived in the house\r\nduring these twelve years, and that he has saved in rent that he would\r\nhave paid elsewhere, at least $1800.\r\n\r\n  He has paid               $2228.00\r\n  He has saved               1800.00\r\n                            --------\r\n      Real cost of house     $428.00\r\n\r\nNow he is the full owner of his own home. During the next twelve years\r\nhe will have nothing to pay but taxes and water rent, and possibly some\r\nslight repairs, at the most not over $400 all told.\r\n\r\nHis next door neighbor is still a renter, and pays $1800 to his\r\nlandlord during the second period named; and the two accounts compared\r\nshow:—\r\n\r\n  Rent payer                $1800.00\r\n  House owner                 400.00\r\n                            --------\r\n      Saving                $1400.00\r\n\r\nThis is equal to a saving of, say, $10.00 a month for 144 months,\r\nand if used in the purchase of ten shares of building society stock\r\nwould be worth at the time named $2000, instead of $1400 merely saved.\r\nThe neighbor who is a tenant is still paying rent and owns neither a\r\nstick nor a stone, while the building society borrower owns one house\r\nfree and also has the command of $2000 in cash, all on account of his\r\nhouse-owning experiment.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. THE BANQUET.\r\n\r\nIt is customary for the directors of these societies, at their own\r\nexpense, to celebrate the closing of a successful year, and have as\r\ntheir guests representatives from other societies. “The banquet”\r\nincludes officers from fully fifty companies, some being directors of\r\nfour or five associations. At these gatherings experiences are related\r\nand subjects for the advancement of the cause are discussed. Every\r\nindividual present on these occasions volunteers the information that\r\nhe owed all he possessed to the building society and its teachings.\r\n\r\nWhat the bottles on the table may have contained, it matters not now,\r\nfor they are empty and are not capable of doing any harm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEPOCH-MAKERS OF THE CENTURY\r\n\r\nBY REV. A. LEFFINGWELL,\r\n\r\n_Rector of Trinity Church, Toledo, Ohio_.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery century has had its epoch-making characters,—men and women\r\nwho dominated and directed the thoughts, purposes, activities, and\r\nachievements of their times. The nineteenth century is distinguished\r\nabove all others by the number and quality of those who came to stand\r\nfor the inception, advance, and culmination of the world’s great\r\nmovements and who highly exemplified in their careers the enterprise\r\nand genius of their day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ABRAHAM LINCOLN.]\r\n\r\nThe object here is to designate, and make brief mention of, some of\r\nthose who have fairly earned the title of epoch-maker, with the hope\r\nof providing a delightful historic study, and further enhancing the\r\ninstructive value of a volume addressed to the triumphs and wonders of\r\nthe century.\r\n\r\nSTATESMEN, ORATORS, AND JURISTS.—Abraham Lincoln (b. February 12,\r\n1809; d. April 14, 1865) sprang from the masses, and grew up with\r\ntheir institutions rather than with the learning of the schools. He\r\ngrew into leadership because he was one of the “million,” had hard\r\nsense and was true. As a forcible exponent of the sentiment of his\r\nparty he was elected President in 1861. His election was the signal\r\nfor secession and war. His mastery of the most delicate situation in\r\nthe history of his country was superb. His patience, his perseverance\r\namid hard trials, his wisdom of administration, his adaptation to the\r\nmarch of events, his striking and educative speech, his determination\r\nto preserve a union of States, all led grandly and inevitably to the\r\ncrowning act of his noble career,—the abolition of slavery in the\r\nUnited States in 1863.\r\n\r\nThere is no sadder chapter in history, and no greater loss for any\r\nnation or time, than that of his taking off (after being a second time\r\nhonored by the presidency) at the hands of an assassin, on the night of\r\nApril 14, 1865.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JEFFERSON DAVIS.]\r\n\r\nJefferson Davis (b. June 3, 1808; d. December 6, 1889) stood for the\r\ncause of the South against the Union, as it took concrete political\r\nform in the shape of the Confederacy, of which he became the only\r\nPresident. Though, perhaps, lacking the ability of such leaders as\r\nCalhoun and Stephens, he was a conscientious and persistent advocate\r\nof the doctrines which culminated in war, and as chief executive ruled\r\nwith energy and firmness.\r\n\r\nHenry Clay (b. April 12, 1777; d. July 29, 1852) was a born orator\r\nand natural party leader. In statesmanship he was intensely patriotic\r\nand always able, being highly informed and skillful in debate. He\r\ncame to stand as the champion of those doctrines which the Whig\r\nparty supported, such as protection to home industries, internal\r\nimprovements, and reciprocity. Upon the question of slavery which\r\nagitated Congress during most of his career he generally assumed an\r\nattitude of compromise, and fathered so many measures of a pacifying\r\nnature that he was called “the great pacificator.”\r\n\r\nDaniel Webster (b. January 18, 1782; d. October 24, 1852) typifies\r\nthe gigantic and imposing in New England intellect and physique. As\r\nearly as 1820 he stood at the very head of American orators, a fame\r\nsoon to be followed in the ranks of law and statesmanship. At first he\r\nopposed the doctrine of protection, but subsequently gave his support\r\nto Henry Clay’s “American policy.” In the United States Senate, he\r\nwon the titles of “expounder of the Constitution” and “supporter and\r\ndefender of the Union,” by his masterly denunciations of the doctrine\r\nof nullification.\r\n\r\nJames Monroe (b. April 28, 1758; d. July 4, 1831) reached the\r\npresidency twice, once in 1817, and again in 1820. His last\r\nadministration was characterized as “the era of good feeling,” during\r\nwhich new States were admitted, Florida was acquired, the Louisiana\r\nboundary defined, slavery prohibited north of certain lines, and\r\nmany provoking controversies with England were settled. In 1823 he\r\nsignalized his administration by promulgating the now famous “Monroe\r\nDoctrine,” which was a warning to Europe that monarchical governments\r\nwould not be allowed to interfere in the affairs of either North or\r\nSouth America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM E. GLADSTONE.]\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams (b. July 11, 1767; d. February 23, 1848) typed the\r\nFederalism of the early part of the nineteenth century, and won the\r\nhighest place in scholarly statesmanship. In diplomacy he filled\r\nmany prominent and difficult positions at home and abroad. As sixth\r\nPresident of the United States, he was opposed by a majority in\r\nCongress, and consequently failed to distinguish his administration. He\r\nwas the forerunner of those sentiments which culminated in organized\r\nopposition to the doctrine of human slavery.\r\n\r\nJohn C. Calhoun (b. March 18, 1782; d. March 31, 1850) was twice\r\nVice-President of the United States, and as Senator became the leading\r\nexponent of the doctrine of States’ rights and nullification of\r\nfederal tariff laws. He ranked with Clay and Webster as a debater and\r\nconstitutional expounder, and the three were known as “the Great Trio.”\r\nIn him the pro-slavery cause found its subtlest, ablest, and most\r\nlogical defender. With a fully stored mind of highly metaphysical turn,\r\na fearlessness and persistency that were matchless, and a character\r\nabove reproach, he greatly endeared himself in the South, and his\r\nwritings are held in high esteem by men of his school of politics.\r\n\r\nRufus Choate (b. October 1, 1799; d. July 13, 1859) was probably\r\nthe best-equipped scholar of the public men of the century, and was\r\nunusually brilliant as orator, lawyer, and publicist. Next to Mr.\r\nWebster he was the greatest member of the Massachusetts bar. He may be\r\ncalled the American Lord Erskine.\r\n\r\nCount Camillo Benso di Cavour, of Italy (b. August 10, 1810; d. June\r\n6, 1861), found a life-work in the unification of the Italian States.\r\nBy pursuing a masterly course in European diplomacy he brought the\r\nstates of North Italy into unity, and finally, through the efforts\r\nof Garibaldi, those of Southern Italy became united with them in one\r\nkingdom under the rule of Victor Emmanuel in 1860. Though not a man of\r\n“blood and iron,” like Bismarck, he was the equal of his great German\r\ncontemporary in diplomacy.\r\n\r\nWilliam Ewart Gladstone (b. December 29, 1809; d. May 19, 1898)\r\nwas four times premier of England. As orator, political leader and\r\nstatesman, and critic in the immense range of subjects he covered, his\r\ngenius was without parallel. It may be said that his was the mightiest\r\npersonality and most catholic and powerful intellect of any Englishman.\r\nHe championed the cause of Christianity among all nations, sounded the\r\nfirst trumpet call of Italian liberty, opposed Turkey as a Mohammedan\r\npower, raised England’s commercial prosperity to the highest notch,\r\nunraveled the entanglements of Beaconsfield’s ministry, inaugurated\r\nthe most astonishing reforms in all directions, but especially in the\r\nchurch, education, army, and among the labor unions. It is almost\r\nimpossible to name any matter of national or international importance\r\nin which his personality and genius were not felt for good.\r\n\r\nAlexander Hamilton (b. January 11, 1757; d. July 11, 1804) was by all\r\nodds the ablest jurist and statesman of the early constitutional era of\r\nthe United States. He became the first Secretary of the Treasury, and\r\nlifted the finances of the government from utter prostration to high\r\nprosperity. As fiscal organizer his success was unparalleled, and all\r\nafter administrations of the Treasury have been practically along the\r\nlines he first laid down. He was easily the leader of that party which\r\nlooked with disfavor on “States’ Rights,” and favored a strong central\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Disraeli, Earl of Beaconsfield (b. December 21, 1804; d. April\r\n19, 1881), stood, as premier, for English “territorial aristocracy” and\r\nfor that “territorial expansion” which fixed the wide boundaries of\r\nthe Indian Empire, made Queen Victoria Empress of India, taught both\r\nRussia and India to refrain from meddling with England’s possessions,\r\nmade the English voice preëminent in the disposition of Continental\r\nterritory, and completely defeated the schemes of Russia against\r\nTurkey. Under him the middle classes lost, and the laboring classes\r\ngained, political power. His career greatly heightened the national\r\ninstitutions and character, as well as the international reputation and\r\npower, of his country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THOMAS JEFFERSON.]\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson (b. April 2, 1743; d. July 4, 1826) stood in the past\r\ncentury as an able exponent of American rights, and his views were\r\nincorporated into the Declaration of Independence, of which he was\r\nthe acknowledged author. He equally stood as the leading exponent of\r\nthat political school of thought which favored decentralization, or\r\nlimitation of the powers of the central government. After his election\r\nto the presidency in 1800, he signalized his administration by what is\r\nknown as the Louisiana purchase, for $15,000,000. In thus enlarging\r\nthe area of the country by boundaries of vast extent, he became one of\r\nthe earliest and most enthusiastic of expansionists, and that without\r\nreference to the modernly mooted question of “government without the\r\nconsent of the governed.”\r\n\r\nRichard Cobden, of England (1804–1865), was a humanitarian of great\r\nnative breadth and liberality, largely increased by travel and constant\r\nobservation. He was a powerful leader in the famous Manchester School\r\nof English statesmen. His share in modern progress was fourfold;\r\nfirst, in securing the repeal of the odious tax on corn in 1846;\r\nsecond, in urging arbitration rather than arms as a final resort to\r\nsettle international disputes; third, in negotiating with France the\r\nCommercial Treaty of 1860, which Mr. Gladstone said no other living man\r\ncould have secured; fourth, in his vigorous and successful opposition\r\nof all efforts to enforce England’s recognition of the Southern\r\nConfederacy during the late civil war.\r\n\r\nPrince Otto E. L. Bismarck, of Germany (b. April 1, 1815; d. July 30,\r\n1898), blended the unerring instinct, great far-sightedness, fertility\r\nin invention and expedients, and adroit diplomacy of a statesman, with\r\nabsolute fearlessness, inflexible purpose, indomitable energy, and\r\nresistless force. Thoroughly German, he was preëminently and always\r\nPrussian, and his great life-work was the accomplishment of German\r\nunity with Prussia at the head. This he achieved by the humiliation of\r\nAustria and France, and the gradual accession of all the distinctively\r\nGerman states.\r\n\r\nWendell Phillips (1811–1884) exemplified the wonderful power of the\r\nskillfully colloquial in public speech, and is a type of the American\r\norator who devotes his ability to correct public abuses, right public\r\nwrongs, and educate the public mind and taste. Chiefly as an avowed\r\nabolitionist, as advocate of the temperance cause, as champion of the\r\nIndians and of woman’s rights to the ballot, and as untiring mover in\r\nimproving the nation’s penal institutions, Mr. Phillips most largely\r\ncontributed to public weal and progress.\r\n\r\nJames Gillespie Blaine (b. June 31, 1830; d. January 27, 1893),\r\nwhether serving in the House, Senate, or Cabinet, had few equals as a\r\nstatesman, debater, parliamentarian, or enthusiastic political leader.\r\nThough often disappointed in his aspirations for the presidency, he\r\nlost none of that wonderful power which he had acquired by reason of\r\nhis energy, tact, skill, personal magnetism, and knowledge of public\r\nmen and measures. He became the special champion of the doctrine of\r\nreciprocity, and by its practical application during Mr. Harrison’s\r\nadministration proved its benefits to commerce and international trade\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\nBy his splendid series of decisions and opinions, Joseph Story\r\n(September 18, 1779; September 10, 1845) shares with John Marshall\r\nthe merit of determining and of developing towards its fullest\r\ncapacity the power of the United States Supreme Court, as set forth\r\nin the Constitution, over state courts and state legislation. He also\r\npractically constructed the United States Admiralty Law and, even\r\nto-day, his “Commentaries on the American Constitution,” in connection\r\nwith both of his foregoing services, is a standard work. He represents\r\nthe broad and powerful American judicial mind, which has contributed so\r\nlargely to the integrity of the Union.\r\n\r\nJames Kent (b. July 31, 1763; d. December 12, 1847) was professor, judge\r\nof chancery, justice and chief justice of the N. Y. Supreme Court, and\r\nchancellor of New York. He possessed immense legal learning, and to\r\nhim is primarily due the creation of New York courts of equity. His\r\nexhaustive “Commentaries upon American Law” is accepted at home and\r\nabroad as one of the great classics of American law literature.\r\n\r\nFrancis Wharton was born March 7, 1820, and died February 21,\r\n1884. Although at the age of forty-three he exchanged law for the\r\nministry, he still showed the legal tendency of his mind in a long\r\ncareer as professor of ecclesiastical and international law in Boston\r\ninstitutions. He enriched the literature of his profession by many\r\nvaluable and standard works on law, municipal, state, national, and\r\ninternational, and, under Mr. Cleveland, was of great service to the\r\nadministration as United States Examiner of International Claims in the\r\nDepartment of State.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OTTO E. L. VON BISMARCK.]\r\n\r\nLouis Adolphe Thiers, of France (b. April 16, 1797; d. September\r\n3, 1877), was editor, historian, and statesman, and in the latter\r\nrole became a distinguished leader of French thought and polity. His\r\ngreatest service to his country was after the Franco-Prussian war,\r\nwhen the Assembly elected him chief of the executive, with the title\r\nof “President of the Republic.” In this capacity he was particularly\r\nsuccessful in negotiating the terms of peace with Germany, and in\r\nfulfilling all the conditions of peace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HON. WILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n(Copyright, 1896, by F. Gutekunst.)]\r\n\r\nWilliam McKinley (b. January 29, 1843) became a leading champion\r\nof the doctrine of industrial protection at an early period in his\r\ncongressional career. In 1883 Hon. W. D. Kelley said of him: “He has\r\ndistanced all his colleagues in mastering the details of the tariff.”\r\nThe Tariff Act of 1890 came to be popularly known as the “McKinley\r\nBill.” Elected President in 1896, his administration was signalized\r\nby that humanitarian interference in behalf of struggling Cuban\r\npatriots, which culminated in the Spanish-American war, and the most\r\nunprecedented triumph of modern times. It had the added distinction of\r\nrounding out the nineteenth and introducing the twentieth century.\r\n\r\nWARRIORS.—Napoleon Bonaparte (Napoleon I.), soldier, statesman,\r\nand Emperor of the French (b. August 15, 1769; d. May 5, 1821), was\r\nthe greatest of the world’s masters in the art of war. His numerous\r\ncampaigns, conducted with a brilliancy never before equaled, had for\r\ntheir object the humiliation of the countries of Europe, and the\r\nestablishment of an imperial policy in which France should be supreme.\r\nThis he came very near to effecting, in spite of closely combined and\r\npersistent opposition. None of the frequent coalitions formed to thwart\r\nhis ambitions and stay his martial progress proved absolutely effective\r\ntill that of March 25, 1815, was formed, which put an army of 700,000\r\nmen in the field against him. It was a part of this army that he met at\r\nWaterloo, June 18, 1815, where defeat awaited him, together with the\r\neclipse of his gigantic influence and phenomenal genius.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRANT’S TOMB, RIVERSIDE DRIVE, NEW YORK CITY.]\r\n\r\nUlysses Simpson Grant (b. April 27, 1822; d. July 23, 1885), graduated\r\nat West Point and had a brief military experience in the Mexican war.\r\nOn the breaking out of the Civil War he reëntered the Federal service\r\nfrom civil life, and by exceptional fertility of resource achieved a\r\nseries of victories in the West which led to his command of all the\r\nUnion forces, with the specially conferred title of lieutenant-general,\r\na title subsequently raised to that of general. By the brilliant,\r\npersistent, and simultaneous campaigns he carried through in the East\r\nand West, he further clinched his title as one of the world’s greatest\r\ngenerals, and ended the conflict with honorable peace. He was honored\r\ntwice with the presidency of the nation, and through the trying period\r\nof reconstruction his wise statesmanship cemented the Union his sword\r\nhad preserved.\r\n\r\nArthur Wellesley Wellington of England (b. May 1, 1769; d. September\r\n22, 1852), attained his first real military distinction in the\r\ncampaigns of the English in India. He further added to his fame in the\r\ncampaign against France in the Spanish peninsula. But his greatest\r\nglory as a warrior was reached in 1814, when, with the aid of the\r\nPrussian marshal Blücher, he defeated Napoleon at the decisive battle\r\nof Waterloo. He was afterwards honored with a seat in the House of\r\nLords, and as Prime Minister of the Tory party, but his statesmanship\r\nproved to be of an inferior and unpopular order.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DUKE OF WELLINGTON.]\r\n\r\nHelmuth Karl Bernhard von Moltke, of Germany (b. October 26, 1800;\r\nd. April 24, 1891), was the world’s greatest exponent of strictly\r\nscientific warfare. He made the Prussian army a most powerful and\r\ndangerous machine, and led it triumphantly against Denmark and\r\nAustria. By dint of strict organization and drill he made the armies\r\nof the German Confederation equally effective, as was shown in\r\nthe Franco-German war (1870–71), which was a series of brilliant\r\nvictories, ending with the capitulation of Paris and the downfall of\r\nNapoleon III. and his empire. His greatness lay in the fact that cool,\r\nsober calculation always dominated his greatest audacity of plan.\r\n\r\nSimon Bolivar, or Bolivar y Ponte (b. July 25, 1785; d. December 17,\r\n1830), justly earned the surname of “The Liberator.” The first and\r\ngreatest of those South American patriots who struck against the\r\ntyrannical colonial system of Spain, he achieved the independence\r\nof the three States of Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru, secured their\r\nrecognition by the civilized world, and lived to govern them with the\r\nwisdom and moderation of a wise executive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COUNT VON MOLTKE.]\r\n\r\nRobert E. Lee (b. January 19, 1807; d. October 12, 1870), graduated\r\nat West Point, and was in the constant military service of the United\r\nStates till the breaking out of the Civil War. He then transferred his\r\nservices to the Confederacy, and speedily became the highest exponent\r\nof its military powers. Honorable, just, energetic, persistent,\r\nskillful in offensive or defensive warfare, schooled in strategy,\r\nfull of devices and combinations to overcome desperate situations, he\r\nprolonged a hopeless struggle to an astounding degree, and met defeat\r\nand surrender without dishonor. He readily ranks as one of the world’s\r\ngreatest generals.\r\n\r\nLajos (Louis) Kossuth of Hungary (b. April 27, 1802; d. March 20,\r\n1894), as writer, lawyer, and statesman, came to stand for Hungarian\r\nfreedom. After the declaration of independence of his country in 1849,\r\nhe became its military and political ruler, but was forced by Russian\r\nintervention and domestic rivalry from his high place, and escaped to\r\nforeign lands to pass the balance of his life in eloquent but fruitless\r\nappeals in behalf of his cause and people.\r\n\r\nGiuseppe Garibaldi, of Italy (b. July 4, 1807; d. June 2, 1882),\r\ntyped the restless, daring soldier, the impulsive statesman, and the\r\nenergetic defender of freedom. He shared Count Cavour’s desire for a\r\nfree and united Italy, and grew to be a great popular hero. Upon his\r\ncapture of the two Sicilies, he presented them to Victor Emmanuel,\r\nthus consummating his life dream of unification, and his desire for\r\na government in which the wishes of the people were, to some extent,\r\nrecognized.\r\n\r\nNAVAL HEROES.—Stephen Decatur (b. January 5, 1771; d. March 22, 1820)\r\nattained the rank of captain in the U. S. Navy for his gallant exploit\r\nof burning the frigate Philadelphia in the harbor of Tripoli, after she\r\nhad been captured by the Tripolitans. He won further fame as commodore\r\nin the war of 1812, and again in the war with Algiers, Tunis, and\r\nTripoli. Quick to comprehend emergencies and prompt in action, he was\r\na type of the dashing and absolutely fearless American seaman. True to\r\nhis fiery nature, he found his death in a duel with Commodore Barron.\r\n\r\nOliver Hazard Perry (b. August 23, 1785; d. August 23, 1819) was\r\nrewarded with the rank of captain in the U. S. Navy for the remarkable\r\ncourage and dash which eventuated in the memorable victory over the\r\nBritish fleet in Lake Erie, September 10, 1813. This victory gave the\r\nAmericans control of the Great Lakes and hastened, more than any single\r\nevent, the conquest of the Northwest and the end of the War of 1812.\r\nHe saw further honorable service as commander of the Mediterranean\r\nsquadron, and died at Port Spain, on the island of Trinidad, of yellow\r\nfever.\r\n\r\nDavid Dixon Porter (b. June 8, 1813; d. February 13, 1891) grew\r\nand ripened gradually into one of the great naval captains of the\r\nnineteenth century. His courage and energy, large experience, and\r\nintimate knowledge of the rivers and seacoasts of the country fitted\r\nhim for the great emergencies of the Civil War. Many of the victories\r\nof the Union armies in the West were due to his cöoperation with\r\ngunboats. He greatly aided in the initial success of Farragut’s\r\nexpedition up the Mississippi, the reduction of Vicksburg, and other\r\nstrongholds upon Western waters. The greatest victory of his life\r\nwas the capture of Fort Fisher. He wrote a history of the U. S. Navy\r\nduring the war, a work commended by all naval nations. On the death of\r\nFarragut, 1870, he reached the high rank of admiral.\r\n\r\nDavid Glascoe Farragut (b. July 5, 1801; d. August 14, 1870) supplies\r\nthe highest type of the skillful, cautious American naval commander,\r\nbacked up by extraordinary dash and boldness. His signal achievements\r\nduring the Civil War were the destruction of the Confederate fleet\r\nin the Mississippi, the capture of New Orleans, the passage of the\r\nforts at Port Hudson and the batteries at Vicksburg, and the capture\r\nof Mobile. For his brilliant and successful services the rank of\r\nvice-admiral was especially created for him by the government, and\r\nafterwards that of admiral.\r\n\r\nJohn Adolf Dahlgren (b. November 13, 1809; d. July 12, 1870) was a\r\nprime agent in developing the Naval Ordnance Department and its\r\nworks at Washington. He invented and made the well-known Dahlgren\r\nguns. During the Civil War he commanded the South Atlantic blockading\r\nsquadron, of some ninety vessels, and did splendid service for the\r\nUnion cause. He was author of many naval articles and books, some of\r\nthe latter being used as text books by the government.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEN. GIUSEPPE GARIBALDI.]\r\n\r\nRaphael Semmes (b. September 27, 1809; d. August 30, 1877) types more\r\nfully than any other the naval dash and efficiency of the Confederacy.\r\nIn him, as commander of the Sumter and Alabama, the merchant marine of\r\nthe United States found its direst enemy, and his exploits upon the\r\nocean won for him a fame which overshadowed those of even higher rank,\r\nbut whose services were limited to narrower fields of naval activity.\r\n\r\nAdmiral George Dewey (b. December 26, 1837) acquired considerable\r\nnaval experience in the Civil War. At the breaking out of hostilities\r\nwith Spain (1898) he was in command of the U. S. squadron in Eastern\r\nwaters, and was ordered to destroy the Spanish fleet in the harbor of\r\nManila. His attack was prompt and daring, and it ended in one of the\r\nmost notable victories in the history of naval warfare. In a few hours\r\nthe entire fleet of Spain in the Orient was swept away, together with\r\nher power, and the United States was placed in possession of a new and\r\nmagnificent island empire whose maintenance and government may change\r\nthe whole history of the Orient, if not of the world.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Sampson’s contribution to the century’s progress lies in the\r\nline of skillful preparation for emergencies, and promptitude in\r\nmeeting them. He became an epoch-maker in the history of the United\r\nStates by means of the great and decisive victory over the Spaniards,\r\nwon by the fleet under his command in the waters off Santiago.\r\n\r\nPREACHERS AND TEACHERS.—The Rev. James McCosh (b. April 1, 1811; d.\r\nNovember 6, 1894) was an able leader of that great school of literary\r\nmen, scholars, educators, and aggesssive practical thinkers which this\r\ncentury chiefly seems to have produced.\r\n\r\nHis contribution to modern progress lies mainly along three lines:—\r\n\r\nFirst, in his efforts to obtain the Free Church of Scotland, and\r\nestablish it.\r\n\r\nSecond, in his most successful administration of the affairs of\r\nPrinceton College while he was president of that institution.\r\n\r\nThird, by his numerous, original, and powerful writings, chiefly\r\ncontroversial and philosophical.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Charles Hodge (b. December 28, 1797; d. June 19, 1878) was a\r\nfine example of the modern expositor of the dogmas of Calvinism. Strong\r\nin conviction and persistent in purpose, a clear, logical thinker and\r\nwriter, he naturally became a very powerful leader, his influence being\r\nparticularly felt in establishing the present exalted position of the\r\nPresbyterians, especially of the old school division. This influence\r\nwas wielded partly from his chair as Professor of Didactic, Exegetic,\r\nand Polemic Theology, and especially in the famous Princeton Review,\r\nwhich owes its greatness chiefly to his editorship and contributions.\r\n\r\nPhilip Schaff (b. 1819; d. October 20, 1893) is a type of the scholar\r\nwho, through profound research and interpretation, has created an epoch\r\nin theology by his contributions to the nineteenth century, mainly in\r\nhistorical and exegetical branches.\r\n\r\nHenry Ward Beecher (b. June 24, 1813; d. March 8, 1887) easily earned\r\nthe reputation of the greatest pulpit orator of his day. As pastor of\r\nPlymouth (Congregational) Church in New York, his genius and remarkable\r\neloquence attracted and held one of the largest congregations in the\r\nUnited States. Spontaneity, tact, emotion were elements of his oratory,\r\nand these were always supplemented by force, depth, subtilty, and\r\nquick grasp of intellect and heart. His versatility was phenomenal.\r\nJournalism, literature, politics, social life, philanthropy, parochial\r\norganization, and even agriculture and many other branches were\r\ntouched upon by him, and all with results varying from excellent to\r\nextraordinary.\r\n\r\nRalph Waldo Emerson (b. May 25, 1803; d. April 27, 1882) passed through\r\nthe career of teacher and preacher to that of general writer, lecturer,\r\nand poet. He should probably be classed with the metaphysicians or\r\nphilosophers. His publication of “Nature” in 1835 marked a new era in\r\nAmerican thought. From subsequent addresses and works may be dated the\r\nintellectual movement which was called _Transcendentalism_, and which\r\nwas a reaction against formalism and tradition. He lacked the method\r\nessential to the foundation of a new philosophy, but his works form a\r\npermanent addition to the highest literature of the human race.\r\n\r\nPhillips Brooks (b. December 13, 1835; d. January 23, 1893) was one\r\nof those phenomenal preachers of the century who won the hearing\r\nand hearts of his auditors by largeness and liberality of thought;\r\nspirituality, earnestness, self-sacrifice, and great love; and by\r\nbeauty and poise of character. He seldom preached doctrine, but relied\r\non the efficacy of ardent exhortation, and the finding and kindling of\r\nthe good in each auditor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLES H. SPURGEON.]\r\n\r\nCharles H. Spurgeon (b. June 19, 1834; d. January 31, 1892) stands as a\r\ntype of the great popular preacher and leader in charitable work. With\r\nBaptist view’s, he revived his own denomination and exerted a helpful\r\ninfluence on all others. No divine of his time swayed so resistlessly\r\nthe immense audiences he attracted. His plain sermons were always\r\nlightened with happy illustrations and delivered with rare power and\r\npersonal magnetism, and they had the exceptional quality of retaining\r\nmuch of their charm and persuasiveness when in print.\r\n\r\nFriedrich Froebel of Thuringia, Germany (b. April 21, 1782; d. June\r\n2, 1852), was a born educator, and his great life-work lay wholly in\r\nthat direction. He studied not so much to get knowledge of particular\r\nbranches as to discover their natural unity and hidden connection.\r\nHe was the advocate of the new education, and pushed the system of\r\nPestalozzi far beyond its author’s dreams. According to Froebel, man\r\nand nature are governed by the same laws; and, by his observation of\r\nboth, he reached his idea of what man’s development should be, and how\r\nto accomplish it. True development must of course proceed from within,\r\nfrom self activity. And as every age of man is complete in itself,\r\nits perfect development can come from only such development in the\r\npreceding age. Hence, the necessity of properly training and educating\r\nyoung children. This course of reasoning resulted in his invention of\r\nthe kindergarten system, together with his self-sacrificing devotion\r\nin training teachers, and in his heroic perseverance notwithstanding\r\nbitter opposition, or indifference.\r\n\r\nVictor Cousin, of France (b. November 28, 1792; d. June 15, 1867),\r\nwas a renowned epoch-maker of the century in founding the school of\r\nsystematic eclecticism in philosophy. His system sets forth a doctrine\r\nof catholic comprehension and toleration of others. Few men did more in\r\nofficial and private life to advance the cause of general education in\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nWilliam Wilberforce, of England (b. August 24, 1759; d. July 29, 1833),\r\nwith Pitt and Clarkson, led in the cause of freeing the slaves, being\r\nhimself the greatest type of the English abolitionist. For forty-six\r\nyears he maintained unceasing and relentless warfare against slavery,\r\nand his priceless gift to the present century was the final and\r\ncomplete extinction of slavery and of the slave-trade in the British\r\npossessions.\r\n\r\nHISTORIANS.—William H. Prescott (b. May 14, 1796; d. January 27, 1859)\r\nproved himself to be an epoch-maker in the sense that he combined the\r\nworth of history with the brilliance and fascination of the novel, and\r\ndeveloped the entirely new field of Spain’s career at home and in her\r\ncolonies. His “Ferdinand and Isabella,” “Conquest of Mexico,” “Conquest\r\nof Peru,” and “History of Philip II,” all obtained a world-wide\r\ncirculation, and both placed and kept their author in the highest rank\r\nof modern American historians.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM WILBERFORCE.]\r\n\r\nFrançois P. G. Guizot, of France (b. October 4, 1784; d. September 13,\r\n1874), was both statesman and historian. In the former capacity he\r\nheld several important public positions, and from 1840 to 1847 was,\r\nas Minister of Foreign Affairs, really at the head of the government.\r\nHis many proposed reforms brought on the revolution of 1848 and the\r\ndethronement of Louis Philippe. Though ranking as one of the greatest\r\nof French statesmen, his highest and most enduring reputation rests\r\non his historical writings, which are very numerous, and the chief of\r\nwhich is his “General History of Civilization in Europe.” His works\r\nare classics of historical research, and inspiring forerunners of the\r\nmodern method of treating history.\r\n\r\nJames Anthony Froude (b. October 23, 1818; d. October 20, 1894) ranks\r\nas one of the brightest of England’s writers and historians, though not\r\none of the most reliable. His writings are characterized, in the main,\r\nby ultra-Protestantism; and in his two most important works, “The\r\nEnglish in Ireland in the 18th Century,” and “The History of England,”\r\nhe endeavors to justify his country’s severe treatment of the Irish\r\nRomanists, to establish Henry VIII. as the chief champion of English\r\nindependence, and also to bestow upon her ministers much of the credit\r\npopularly supposed to belong to Queen Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nJohn L. Motley (b. Massachusetts, April 15, 1814; d. England, May\r\n29, 1877) typifies the patient and painstaking searcher for truth\r\nin the development of national history; and also the sympathetic,\r\ngraphic, and spirited painter of the scenes, events, and characters\r\nwhich he presents. His “Rise of the Dutch Republic,” “History of the\r\nUnited Netherlands,” and “Life and Death of John of Barneveld” are\r\nall undeniably great contributions to the historical literature of\r\nthe present century, besides being monuments to the exacting toil and\r\nresearch of years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THOMAS B. MACAULAY.]\r\n\r\nHenry Thomas Buckle, of England (b. November 24, 1822; d. May 29,\r\n1862) is a conspicuous type of the patient and learned historian. His\r\nprincipal donation to modern progress is “The History of Civilization\r\nin England,” a work whose novel theories created an epoch in the\r\nphilosophy of history, and called forth much controversy. According to\r\nhim, civilization was due not so much to moral or religious influence\r\nas to material causes,—soil, climate, food, atmosphere, etc.\r\n\r\nGeorge Bancroft (b. October 3, 1800; d. January 17, 1891) was equally\r\nrenowned as statesman and historian. As a member of President Polk’s\r\ncabinet, he was instrumental in founding the Naval Academy at Annapolis\r\nand the Naval Observatory at Washington. As minister to Prussia he\r\nnegotiated several foreign treaties, and ably conducted the settlement\r\nof the “Northwest Boundary” question. But his great life-work was his\r\n“History of the United States,” on which he labored untiringly till his\r\ndeath. It is the most exhaustive, philosophic, and inspiring of our\r\nnational histories.\r\n\r\nRichard Hildreth (b. June 28, 1807; d. June 11, 1865) was one of the\r\ncentury’s valuable contributors to the welfare of the United States\r\nby his “History of Banks,” his many works on morals and politics, and\r\nchiefly by his great life-work, “The History of the United States,” a\r\nproduction of great labor and masterly detail, but somewhat heavily\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\nThomas Babington Macaulay, of England (b. October 25, 1800; d. December\r\n28, 1859), was noted as essayist and statesman. But his genius lay\r\nespecially in history, in which line he was enabled to furnish the\r\nworld with his great life-work, that most remarkable and valuable\r\n“History of England,” which quickly attained a circulation never before\r\nequaled by any similar publication. Though at times partisan and\r\npartial, he was still fortunate in throwing his great strength on the\r\nside of right.\r\n\r\nEDITORS.—Horace Greeley (b. February 3, 1811; d. November 29, 1872)\r\nwas founder of the “New York Tribune.” He took rank as one of the\r\nablest editors of his day, and stood the foremost political advocate\r\nand controversialist of his time in America. He made of his paper a\r\nsplendid property, and through it exercised an influence that reached\r\nfar down among the masses. He lost much of his popularity by his\r\nadvocacy of universal amnesty and impartial suffrage, after the close\r\nof the Civil War, and gradually drifted into the Liberal Republican\r\nparty. This party, in alliance with the Democrats, placed him on the\r\npresidential ticket in 1872. He was disastrously defeated, and died\r\nfrom the effects of hard campaign work and grief.\r\n\r\nJames Gordon Bennett (b. September 1, 1795; d. June 1, 1872), founder\r\nof the “New York Herald,” was the most spirited and daring of those\r\npioneers who revolutionized the journalism of the century. In his paper\r\nhe broke away from high prices and prosaic methods, and inaugurated\r\nthe era of cheap prices, racy news, and independent expression. He\r\npractically developed the present organization of newsboys, the use of\r\nthe telegraph in securing news, and the American system of European and\r\nwar correspondence.\r\n\r\nWilliam Cullen Bryant (b. November 3, 1794; d. June 12, 1878) united\r\nthe scholarship of the general literature and the grace of a poet with\r\nthe genius of a high-toned and brilliant editor. He gave to his paper,\r\nthe “New York Evening Post,” a rank and influence seldom attained in\r\njournalism, especially when it is considered that its patrons were\r\nchiefly of the educated and higher business classes. He represented the\r\ncleanest and most intellectual journalism of the century.\r\n\r\nJohn W. Forney (b. September 20, 1817; d. December 9, 1881) was\r\nfounder and owner of “The Philadelphia Press.” The journalism of the\r\ncentury can boast no more indefatigable and brilliant pen than his,\r\nnor did any journal of his day occupy a more commanding place amid\r\nthe discussions incident to the Civil War and subsequent periods of\r\nreconstruction. He was also editor and owner of the Washington, D. C.,\r\n“Chronicle.”\r\n\r\nCharles Anderson Dana (b. August 8, 1819; d. October 17, 1897) is an\r\ninstance of a scholar and publicist who found a true, though late,\r\noutlet for his genius in the realm of independent journalism. Under\r\nhis editorship and management the “New York Sun” became the model\r\nnews medium of the country, and its editorial, financial, and other\r\ndepartments were conducted with an ability and conscientiousness that\r\ncommanded the widest confidence. He was associate editor of “The New\r\nAmerican Cyclopædia,” and compiler of the admirable “Household Book of\r\nPoetry.”\r\n\r\nJoseph Medill (b. April 6, 1823; d. March 16, 1899) rose to the high\r\nrank of editor-in-chief and principal owner of “The Chicago Tribune,”\r\nthrough the schooling afforded by connection with several minor\r\npapers. No man of the century was more thoroughly imbued with the true\r\neditorial instinct. Of dignified and prudent expression, broad and keen\r\nthought, ever alive to the privileges and power of the press, he made\r\nhis journal a model of excellence in all its varied departments as well\r\nas a colossal property.\r\n\r\nJoseph Pulitzer (b. 1847) was founder and editor of “The St. Louis\r\nPost-Dispatch,” and afterwards became owner and editor of “The New\r\nYork World.” Like the elder Bennett he ranks as one of the dashing,\r\ndaring editors of the century, whose aim is to gain notoriety and\r\nextraordinary circulation for his journal by strong, and often\r\nvituperative, attack upon public men and things, and by tireless\r\nefforts to secure general news of a unique and sensational character,\r\nat whatever cost.\r\n\r\nMurat Halstead (b. 1829) rose to editorial distinction, and became a\r\nstrong factor in the life of the middle West, through his connection\r\nwith the “Cincinnati Commercial,” which he raised to a flourishing\r\nfinancial condition, with immense power in municipal, state, and\r\nnational politics. In 1890 he became editor of “The Standard-Union,”\r\nBrooklyn, N. Y.\r\n\r\nWhitelaw Reid (b. October 27, 1837) is a type of the highest class of\r\nAmerican political editors, and represents the best in that kind of\r\nAmerican journalism which aims to be both alert and catholic in its\r\nefforts, without the sensationalism of personality, exaggeration, or\r\nthe horrible. Next to Mr. Greeley, whom he succeeded as editor, he will\r\nbest be remembered in connection with “The New York Tribune,” and has\r\nmade his journal a great power along nearly all lines, particularly\r\nthose political.\r\n\r\nSCIENTISTS.—Sir Charles Bell, of Scotland (b. November 17, 1774;\r\nd. April 29, 1842), is a shining example of patience and genius for\r\ninvestigation, discovery, and deduction in medical science. The nervous\r\nsystem was his particular forte; and he discovered the most important\r\nprinciple that the brain is divided into two parts, each having its\r\ncorresponding division in the spinal marrow, and that one set of nerves\r\nconveys sensations from the body to the brain, another carrying back\r\nto the body and its muscles the command of the brain, and finally that\r\nnerves conveying different sensations are connected with different\r\nparts of the brain. He was a remarkable surgeon, a brilliant lecturer,\r\nand a medical author of universal fame.\r\n\r\nSamuel D. Gross (b. July 8, 1805; d. May 6, 1884) ranked as one of the\r\nepoch-makers in his profession. As physician, surgeon, and medical\r\nauthor he showed a lofty aim, strict devotion, marked originality, and\r\npowerful intellect. His numerous works commanded world-wide attention\r\nand became accepted standards. Two of them, at least, were the first of\r\ntheir kind ever published in America.\r\n\r\nGeorge C. L. F. D. Cuvier, of France (b. August 23, 1769; d. May 13,\r\n1832), exhibited in his career the immense reformation and advance\r\nin natural history during the first three decades of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. He expanded the system of comparative anatomy as the only\r\ntrue basis of natural history, and from an utterly chaotic and\r\nunintelligible heap of dry facts concerning animal structures he\r\nfinally deduced the underlying, natural principles of unity, in their\r\nclassification and division. He also established many positive laws\r\nof geology and paleontology and, by his vast discoveries and daring\r\nconceptions therein, developed the comparatively new science of fossil\r\nanimal-life to an extent hitherto undreamed of.\r\n\r\nCharles Robert Darwin, of England (b. February 13, 1809; d. April 18,\r\n1893), was one of those well-equipped and persistent scientists whose\r\ninvestigations led to the modern doctrine of the origin and evolution\r\nof species by means of natural selection and preservation of favored\r\nraces in the struggle for life. His conclusions were at first bitterly\r\nrejected, especially by religious scientists, but ere the end of the\r\ncentury came they met with wide acceptance. Only such a genius and\r\npatience as his could have collected, arranged, and interpreted the\r\ngigantic mass of facts out of which he slowly deduced his conclusions.\r\n\r\nLouis J. R. Agassiz (b. May 28, 1807; d. December 14, 1873), was the\r\npremier of his day as a scientist and naturalist. Of wonderful physical\r\nand mental power, vast enthusiasm, untiring industry, and exceptional\r\npropensity for research and orderly arrangement, he developed the\r\nmodern science of ichthyology, propounded new and accepted theories of\r\ngeology and of glacial systems, and established the magnificent Museum\r\nof Natural History at Cambridge, Mass. Astonishingly prolific as a\r\nwriter, he remains a constant source of inspiration to naturalists and\r\nscientists.\r\n\r\nSamuel C. F. Hahnemann, of Germany (b. April 11, 1755; d. July 2,\r\n1843), was an epoch-maker in the field of medicine. By 1820 his\r\ntheories and publications had awakened universal interest, and the\r\nhomœopathic system had become an established school. Despite the\r\nlong and bitter war between allopathy and homœopathy, it is certain\r\nthat the latter has contributed largely to render medicine free from\r\nmany old-time methods of an indefensible, if not actually harmful or\r\ndangerous kind.\r\n\r\nHorace Wells, of Hartford, Conn. (b. January 21, 1815; d. January 14,\r\n1848), was a dentist. His use of nitrous oxide (laughing gas) to render\r\nthe extraction of teeth painless led to its fuller application as an\r\nanæsthetic in surgery, and hence to the discovery of modern anæsthesia\r\nby ether and chloroform. Though robbed of the honor of his discovery by\r\nothers, the dentist Wells is no less a contributor to mankind of one of\r\nthe greatest boons of the century.\r\n\r\nLouis Pasteur, of France (b. December 17, 1822; d. September 28, 1895),\r\ngave new direction and impulse to chemistry and pathology by the\r\ndiscovery that fermentation arose from micro-organisms, and also that\r\ndisease was, in many instances, due to the presence of bacilli in blood\r\nor tissue. He followed this with his system of culture and inoculation,\r\nby means of which he performed most miraculous cures of even such a\r\nvicious disease as hydrophobia. The Pasteur Institute in Paris stands a\r\nmonument to his genius and philanthropy.\r\n\r\nPHILANTHROPISTS.—Stephen Girard (b. May 24, 1750; d. December 26,\r\n1831) was crabbed, unapproachable, penurious, irreligious, yet\r\nstrangely liberal in large public or charitable affairs. Twice\r\nhe helped the government with large loans. Public charities and\r\nimprovements, hospitals, and paradoxically enough, even churches, were\r\nindebted to him for munificent gifts. The greatest monument to his\r\nphilanthropy is Girard College, founded by a bequest of $8,000,000, for\r\nthe education of poor white male orphans.\r\n\r\nJames Smithson, of England (b. about 1765; d. June 27, 1829), was\r\npossibly the first philanthropist to bestow a large endowment upon the\r\nUnited States. With the sum of $500,000 to $600,000, which came to it\r\nfrom this benevolent foreigner, the young republic founded and endowed\r\nthe splendid Smithsonian Institute at Washington for the spread and\r\nincrease of knowledge, thus putting Mr. Smithson in the highest rank\r\nof the world’s benefactors, and erecting an imperishable monument at\r\nanother turning-point in the progress of civilization.\r\n\r\nGeorge Peabody (b. February 18, 1795; d. November 14, 1869) ranks as\r\none of the century’s greatest philanthropists. Among his noblest gifts\r\nwere $3,500,000 for free education and the training of teachers in the\r\nSouthern States, $1,000,000 for a scientific institute at Baltimore,\r\nlarge sums to Harvard University, and a great amount to his native\r\ntown, Danvers, Mass., for educational purposes. Dying in England, he\r\nleft $2,500,000 to London, to found workingmen’s homes.\r\n\r\nJohn Jacob Astor (b. July 17, 1763; d. March 29, 1848) used much of\r\nhis colossal fortune in philanthropy. Perhaps his largest single gift,\r\nat least that by which he is best known as a benefactor, was the sum\r\nof $400,000 to found the Astor Library of New York city. This noble\r\ninstitution is conducted on the public plan, and contains nearly\r\n300,000 volumes.\r\n\r\nJames Lick (b. August 25, 1796; d. October 1, 1876) amassed a fortune\r\nin California, out of which he provided a trust fund for certain public\r\nand charitable purposes. This fund amounted to $5,000,000 at the time\r\nof his death. To him is due the famous Lick Telescope in the University\r\nof California, which cost $700,000; the California School of Mechanic\r\nArts, costing $540,000; the free public baths of San Francisco, costing\r\n$150,000; and numerous other charities and benefactions.\r\n\r\nLeland Stanford (b. March 9, 1824; d. June 20, 1893) acquired a\r\ngreat fortune in California. Inspired by a dream at the time of his\r\nlittle son’s death, he determined to found and endow an institution\r\nof learning in his State. The result was the Leland Stanford Junior\r\nUniversity, whose direct endowment was princely, and whose indirect\r\nendowment is expected to amount to $20,000,000 or more.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.]\r\n\r\nFlorence Nightingale was born, May, 1823, in Florence, Italy, of\r\nEnglish parents, and, prompted by philanthropic instincts, turned her\r\nattention to the relief of humanity. After study in various nursing\r\nschools, she was sent at the head of a corps of trained nurses to\r\ncare for the sick and wounded soldiers of the Crimean war, in which\r\nposition she displayed marvelous energy and ability. A grateful public\r\nsubscribed for her a testimonial of $250,000, which she devoted to the\r\nfounding of a training-school for nurses.\r\n\r\nClara Barton (b. about 1830) left a clerkship in Washington to\r\nengage in the work of alleviating the sufferings of the soldiers\r\nof the Civil War, on the battlefields and in hospitals, a work she\r\nperformed with rare energy and self-sacrifice. She afterwards aided\r\nthe Grand Duchess of Baden in establishing her hospitals during the\r\nFranco-Prussian war, and was decorated with the Golden Cross of Baden\r\nand the Iron Cross of Germany. In 1881 she organized the American Red\r\nCross Society, for which she secured an international treaty giving it\r\nprotection. She performed splendid service in camp and field during the\r\nSpanish-American war.\r\n\r\nJohn D. Rockefeller (b. 1839) is a splendid example of those many\r\nand noble American millionaires who have responded with astonishing\r\nliberality to the promptings of their philanthropic natures. The\r\nreconstruction of the Chicago University, the founding or endowment of\r\nother public institutions, and of numerous charitable benefactions,\r\ntogether embracing the expenditure of many millions, are magnificent\r\nmonuments to Mr. Rockefeller’s share in promoting the progress of his\r\ncountry during the last quarter of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nMatthew Vassar (b. April 29, 1792; d. June 23, 1868) founded Vassar\r\nCollege, N. Y., in 1861. A brewer of large fortune, he conceived the\r\nidea of erecting and endowing a college for women, wherein education\r\ncould be obtained either moderately or gratuitously, and which should\r\nbe undenominational. To this end he gave land and $428,000 for\r\nbuildings and equipment. Again he gave $360,000. Other members of his\r\nfamily added to his gifts, till $1,000,000 and more were expended\r\nin buildings, apparatus, etc., and the endowment amounted to over\r\n$1,000,000.\r\n\r\nINVENTORS.—George Stephenson, of England (b. June 9, 1781; d. August\r\n12, 1848), was the first (1814) to construct a satisfactory locomotive\r\nsteam engine. In 1815 he introduced the steam blast into his second\r\nlocomotive. In 1822 he built and operated his first railway, eight\r\nmiles long. In 1829 his engine, named the Rocket, was driven at the\r\nrate of twenty-nine miles an hour. He invented a safety lamp, which is\r\nstill in use in English collieries. A natural genius and self-taught\r\nmechanic, he refused knighthood, but has received by common consent the\r\ntitle of the father of railways.\r\n\r\nRichard M. Hoe (b. September 12, 1812; d. June 7, 1886) completely\r\nrevolutionized the art of printing by the invention of his “lightning”\r\nrotary press, in 1846. This marvel was capable of printing 20,000\r\nimpressions an hour. After many costly experiments, with a view to\r\nprinting both sides of a sheet at once, he evolved his web-perfecting\r\npress, which drew the paper from a roll, perhaps miles in length, at\r\nthe rate of 1000 feet a minute, printed both sides simultaneously, and\r\ncut and folded the sheets at the rate of 20,000 per hour. Subsequent\r\nimprovements have given his machines a much larger hourly capacity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLARA BARTON.]\r\n\r\nElias Howe (b. June 9, 1819; d. October 3, 1867) contributed the\r\nsewing-machine to the century’s triumphs and wonders, though it is\r\nalleged that the honor of inventing both the eye-pointed needle and\r\nthe lock-stitch belongs to Walter Hunt, between whom and Howe long\r\nlitigation prevailed, finally resulting in the recognition of the 1846\r\npatent of the latter. Modifications and improvements by more recent\r\ninventors have made the sewing-machine the household boon of to-day.\r\n\r\nCyrus W. Field (b. November 30, 1819; d. July 12, 1892) made the\r\nproblem of a telegraphic cable across the Atlantic an aim of his life.\r\nFor thirteen years he labored with wonderful faith and perseverance,\r\nand at last, after a series of defeats and mortifying failures,\r\nsucceeded (1866) in laying a cable that thoroughly solved the problem.\r\nSince then submarine telegraphy has become one of the most useful and\r\npowerful factors in the private and public life of the world.\r\n\r\nSamuel F. B. Morse (b. April 27, 1791; d. April 2, 1872) contributed\r\nto the century’s triumphs and world’s civilization by that brilliant\r\nand persistent series of investigations, which resulted in the first\r\npractical telegraph. He brought his invention before the world in 1844,\r\nand with the aid of the government set up a line of forty miles between\r\nWashington and Baltimore, over which dispatches successfully passed,\r\nMay 24, 1844. From this moment his triumph was complete, and he became\r\nthe recipient of many flattering distinctions at home and abroad.\r\n\r\nJohn Ericsson (b. July 31, 1803; d. March 8, 1899) either invented, or\r\nfirst made practical, the steam fire-engine, the artificial draught for\r\nlocomotives, the reversible locomotive, the “link-motion,” the caloric\r\nengine, and the screw propeller. Discouraged in England, he came to\r\nthe United States in 1839, where he revolutionized naval warfare by\r\napplying the screw propeller to the U. S. S. Princeton, and employing a\r\nrange finder. In 1854 he invented the Monitor iron-clad on principles\r\nfirst applied in the Monitor which defeated the Merrimac in Hampton\r\nRoads, Virginia, March 9, 1862. His career was signalized by many other\r\nvaluable inventions.\r\n\r\nAlexander Graham Bell, born March 3, 1846, besides exploiting in\r\nAmerica his father’s valuable system of instruction to deaf mutes,\r\ntypifies the inventive spirit of his age by his contribution to\r\npublic progress through the material side, as exemplified in that\r\nindispensable aid to modern life, the telephone, with the invention of\r\nwhich he is generally, but by no means undisputedly, credited.\r\n\r\nThomas Alva Edison (b. February 11, 1847) is a splendid example of the\r\ntireless, acute, and practical scientific inventor, and is well named\r\nthe electrical “wizard.” Among the triumphs of his skill and genius are\r\nthe automatic telegraphic repeater; the duplex telegraph, afterwards\r\ndeveloped into the quadruplex and sextuplex transmitter; the printing\r\ntelegraph for stock quotations; the carbon telephone transmitter; the\r\naerophone; the megaphone and microphone; the phonograph and photometer;\r\nthe incandescent lamp; and many other devices for electric lighting.\r\n\r\nNicola Tesla (born 1858), a former pupil and assistant of Edison,\r\nshares with his master the honor of representing the world’s greatest\r\nand most practical of scientific inventors and discoverers. His most\r\nnoted investigations and discoveries have been along the line of\r\narousing luminous vibrations in matter, without, at the same time,\r\nsetting in action heat-vibrations. He has made the remarkable discovery\r\nthat 200,000 volts may pass harmlessly through that body which 2000\r\nwould kill, and is experimenting to produce 3,000,000 vibrations a\r\nminute in matter. He has also shown that both motors and lights can be\r\noperated on one wire without a circuit. His rotary motor is used in\r\nconveying power from the great plant at Niagara Falls.\r\n\r\nNOVELISTS.—Sir Walter Scott, of Scotland (b. August 15, 1771; d.\r\nSeptember 21, 1832), exerted a powerful influence on the literature of\r\nthe century through the medium of his stirring poetry and delightful\r\nfiction, in both of which he was most ready and prolific. His numerous\r\nworks, teeming with striking situations, strong and noble in style, are\r\nmodels of literary excellence, and are as captivating to readers of\r\nto-day as they were half a century ago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR WALTER SCOTT.]\r\n\r\nCharles Dickens, of England (b. February 7, 1812; d. June 9, 1870),\r\nably exemplified that school of novelists who paint homely social\r\nlife with all its innocent, clumsy efforts at humor; its sorrows,\r\nvanities, and weaknesses; its selfishness, malice, and vice; its\r\nwrongs, sufferings, and goodnesses. Though faulty in plot and style\r\nand ridiculous in their exaggerations, his novels marked a new era in\r\nliterature, and no books ever so appealed to the sympathies and good\r\nimpulses of readers.\r\n\r\nJames Fenimore Cooper (b. September 15, 1789; d. September 14, 1851)\r\ntypifies a large and apparently enduring class of fiction writers\r\nof which he was a remarkable forerunner; that school of novelists\r\nwho deal with stirring, bold, and healthful adventure, in which the\r\nAnglo-Saxon mind particularly seems to find unfailing delight. Both at\r\nhome and abroad, his novels attained a wide, sudden, and well-deserved\r\npopularity. And to this day no library of fiction is complete without\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLES DICKENS.]\r\n\r\nNathaniel Hawthorne (b. July 4, 1804; d. May 18, 1864) exhibits in his\r\nnumerous fictional works a man’s breadth and strength of imagination\r\nand a woman’s quick perception and spiritual insight. Almost gloomy in\r\ncolor, overhung with impending fate, and often uncanny, his stories\r\nare yet always fascinating. As has been well said, one catches in them\r\n“gleaming wit, tender satire, exquisite natural description, subtle and\r\nstrange analysis of human life, darkly passionate and weird.”\r\n\r\nCount Leo (or Lyoff) Alekseevich Tolstoi (b. August 28, 1828) is a\r\nRussian aristocrat by birth, but has assumed the dress and life of a\r\npeasant, the better to exploit his doctrines respecting non-resistance,\r\ncommunism, labor, religion, politics, government, and society. His\r\nnumerous writings show a combination of keenness of realistic insight\r\nand wealth of poetical imagination, of a wonderful breadth of view with\r\nperfect handling of minute detail, seldom rivaled in all literature.\r\nWhether or not he will prove to be the forerunner of a great revolution\r\nin the world’s national and social life, there is no disputing his\r\ngenius and pertinacity.\r\n\r\nEdward George Earle Bulwer (Baron Lytton), of England (b. May 25, 1803;\r\nd. January 18, 1873), was novelist, poet, dramatist, and essayist,\r\nand ranked as one of the most versatile and classical authors of the\r\ncentury. Through his plays, poetry, and novels he introduced a new\r\nliterary era, and was the leader, if not actual founder, of the school\r\nof melodramatic romance.\r\n\r\nHarriet Elizabeth Beecher Stowe (b. June 14, 1811; d. July 1, 1896)\r\nacquired great fame as authoress of the epoch-making book, “Uncle Tom’s\r\nCabin.” It proved to be a powerful contribution to the anti-slavery\r\ncause, and served to electrify readers in twenty different languages.\r\nIn dramatized form it has delighted millions of auditors. The authoress\r\nrepresents woman’s efforts for the overthrow of slavery; efforts she\r\nput forth modestly, completely unconscious of their great power and\r\nfuture influence.\r\n\r\nGeorge Eliot, pseudonym of Marian Evans, afterwards Mrs. Lewes, then\r\nMrs. Cross, of England (b. November 22, 1819; d. December 22, 1880),\r\nwas one of the ablest of the world’s female novelists, and had but few\r\nequals among men. She was a leading epoch-maker in that introspective\r\nschool which always with astonishing skill uses the “plot” in all its\r\nevents, environments, and circumstances to develop each character in\r\nstrict logical accord, whether for good or evil.\r\n\r\nVictor Hugo, of France (b. February 20, 1802; d. May 22, 1885), was,\r\nin his day, the most popular author who has ever lived. Few poems, no\r\ndrama, and absolutely no novel have ever produced the immediate and\r\ntremendous effect of his earlier poems, his “Hernani,” and his “Les\r\nMisérables.” Through “Hernani” he completely defeated the classic\r\nschool and became the leader of the romantic school of revolutionary\r\nindividualists, thus creating a new epoch in literature. He invented\r\nnovelties in poetry and prose which produced strength, variety,\r\ndelicacy, harmony, and richness of imagery and coloring, absolutely\r\nunparalleled and original.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LORD BYRON.]\r\n\r\nPOETS.—Lord George Gordon Byron, of England (b. January 22, 1788;\r\nd. April 19, 1824), is a remarkable instance of a poet of marvelous\r\nnatural powers, mingling good and evil in accordance with the whim\r\nthat took him; yet exhibiting distinctly, through it all, evidences\r\nof a great soul and genius. He created an epoch in the world’s poetic\r\nliterature. Skeptical, cynical, melancholy even to sentimentality, and\r\nskillfully manipulating the public side of his affairs to keep up a\r\nmost fascinating air of romantic mystery about them all, he succeeded\r\nin affecting public thought with these characteristics to a wonderful\r\nextent. As a result, “Byronism,” for a time, was the absorbing rage in\r\nall prominent circles, literary and even social.\r\n\r\nHenry W. Longfellow (b. February 27, 1807; d. March 24, 1882) is\r\npossibly the century’s finest type of the people’s poet. Though by\r\nno means a poet of great imaginative or creative powers, yet few\r\nreached his perfect skill as a painstaking and unerring artist; while\r\nnone have ever surpassed him in creating that atmosphere of subtile\r\nbeauty which always seems to surround and penetrate his verse. As an\r\nepoch-maker his influence extended even to Europe, and especially to\r\nEngland, securing him a fame wider and greater than that of any other\r\nAmerican poet, and rarely failing to win the enduring affection of all\r\nkinds of readers.\r\n\r\nJohn Greenleaf Whittier (b. December 17, 1807; d. September 7, 1892),\r\nas an editor and poet contributed no little to the cause of the\r\nabolitionists. Together with Longfellow, Holmes, Lowell, Hawthorne,\r\nand Emerson, he may be considered an epoch-maker in the development of\r\nAmerican literature as guided by the spirit of New England. He types\r\nthe sweet, simple, and absolutely sincere poet whose verse breathes\r\nforth a strong patriotism, and is redolent of the healthful home life\r\nof the Eastern States.\r\n\r\nSir Alfred Tennyson, of England (b. August 6, 1809; d. October 6,\r\n1892), was by far the leading representative of those English poets\r\nwho, while not wanting in the fire and spontaneity of true genius,\r\nnevertheless wrote carefully, after long reflection, with calculation\r\nand toil, as to diction, polish, and arrangement of sentences and\r\nthoughts. His highly-wrought “In Memoriam” and his exquisite, though\r\nsomewhat sensuous “Idylls of the King” were absolutely novel, and mark\r\nan epoch in the history of the world’s poetry.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Barrett Browning (b. 1809; d. June 29, 1861) is, without\r\ndoubt, the greatest poetess of the present century and probably of\r\nany other. She presents an extraordinary instance of the grasp,\r\ncomprehensiveness, and logic of man’s intellect, united with the\r\nintuitions, deep emotions, impulses, and visions of woman. Her especial\r\ncontribution to the progress of this century is not only to the wealth\r\nof its poetry, but also to the careful and discriminating consideration\r\nof many of its social problems.\r\n\r\nRobert Browning (b. in London, May 7, 1812; d. in Venice, December\r\n12, 1889) was the foremost of psychological poets. Belonging to “The\r\nRomantic School,” he created an epoch in literature by carrying his\r\nhigh ideals and wonderful efforts of genius over into what became known\r\nas “The Spasmodic School.”\r\n\r\nACTORS.—Edmund Keene, of England (b. 1787; d. May 15, 1833), was one\r\nof the greatest and most popular actors of all time. He typified, and\r\ngreatly contributed to the success of, that school of actors who rely\r\nalmost solely on their own native genius and acquired powers, rather\r\nthan on the aid of externals. He has been called both the “Byron” and\r\nthe “Napoleon” of actors, and seemed to have the most extraordinary\r\npower both of catching and revealing the meaning of Shakespeare, with\r\nthe quickness and vividness of the lightning flash.\r\n\r\nEdwin Forrest (b. March 9, 1806; d. December 12, 1872) was a tragedian\r\nof the robust type. His success upon the stage was signal, owing to\r\nnatural genius, superb form, and noble presence. For more than a\r\ngeneration he rendered effective and kept popular the leading tragedies\r\nof Shakespeare, and others suited to his powers. The Actors’ Home at\r\nPhiladelphia was endowed by him, and stands as his monument.\r\n\r\nEdwin Booth (b. November 13, 1833; d. June 7, 1893) stood as the\r\nexponent of the refined and lofty in drama. Through his rare\r\nhistrionic powers he became a recognized interpreter of such\r\ncharacters as Richard III., Shylock, Lear, Iago, Othello, Brutus, etc.,\r\nbut he never appeared to better advantage than in Hamlet. His ability\r\nwas as fully recognized abroad as at home. He expended $175,000 in\r\nestablishing the Players’ House and Club in New York.\r\n\r\nCharlotte S. Cushman (b. July 23, 1816; d. February 18, 1876) first won\r\nher histrionic honors in opera. Her voice failed, and then she began\r\nher memorable career as actress, her most famous personations being\r\nLady Macbeth, Bianca, Julia, Beatrice, Lady Teazle, Queen Katharine,\r\nand Meg Merrilies. She readily ranked with the great dramatic artists\r\nof the century, and her skill, native and acquired, divided with her\r\nown splendid character the admiration of the general public.\r\n\r\nTommaso Salvini (b. January, 1830) demonstrates that now very rare and\r\nseverely tragic school of the stage in which the actor appeals to the\r\npublic through his genius and art, rather than through his environments\r\nand accessories. He thus belongs to an apparently closing era in\r\nthe history of the stage. Powerful, passionate yet self-controlled,\r\nmagnificent in physique, in elocution, in reading and in deportment,\r\nas an actor he really belongs to the world, although Italian in both\r\nspirit and training.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Irving (or really John Henry Broadrib), of England, was born\r\nin 1838, and is the leader of that modern school of actors, who depend\r\nnot so much on good reading, acting and general elocution as upon\r\ncareful attention to details in stage-setting and presentation. As an\r\nepoch-maker in the history of the modern drama, he marks that point\r\nwhere the actor begins to look away from his own personal art to that\r\ndisplayed in his surroundings and accessories.\r\n\r\nLYRIC DRAMATISTS.—Ludwig van Beethoven, of Germany (b. December 17,\r\n1770; d. March 26, 1827), is widely held to be the most colossal of\r\nmusical geniuses, in breadth and grasp of intellect, in vastness and\r\nboldness of imagination, and in depth and tenderness of emotion.\r\nHis one opera, “Fidelio,” is by many considered to be unrivaled in\r\nthe realm of pure dramatic music. His sonatas and chamber music are\r\ngenerally conceded easily to lead in those two departments, while his\r\nsymphonies are universally believed to have reached the utmost limit of\r\ndevelopment which is possible in the field of orchestral composition.\r\n\r\nCharles F. Gounod, of France (b. June 17, 1818; d. October 18, 1893),\r\nis an instance of a composer whose permanent fame must rest on but\r\none work, the opera of “Faust,” in which he reached the utmost height\r\nof his powers and success. No opera has ever had such instant,\r\nuniversal, and constant popularity. Eclectic in style, and faithful\r\nand enthusiastic in his art, he did much to advance the progress of\r\nreligious and operatic music in France.\r\n\r\nRobert Schumann, of Saxony (b. June 8, 1810; d. July 29, 1856) was one\r\nof the creators of the romantic school of music. He was not a piano\r\nplayer, but a teacher and composer. His symphonies have been accorded\r\na rank next to those of Beethoven, and for their deep pathos, fine,\r\nintense passion and wild, mournful beauty many of his compositions are\r\nalmost peerless.\r\n\r\nFelix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy (b. February 5, 1809; d. November 4, 1847)\r\nwas as lovely in character as in works. In symphony, song, piano-forte,\r\norgan, or oratorio, he showed himself worthy of being classed with the\r\ngreat musical masters. His compositions suffered eclipse for a time by\r\nthose of a stronger school, but his true position in the musical world\r\nis once more becoming recognized.\r\n\r\nFranz Schubert, of Austria (b. January 31, 1797; d. November 10, 1829),\r\nhas been called “the immortal melodist.” His fecundity was marvelous,\r\nand he is best known by his songs, several hundred in number, and\r\nnearly half of which have immortal quality. He also composed many\r\ncharming symphonies and operas. His chief characteristics are the\r\nfreshness of his delightful melodies supported by harmonies of equal\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nAnton Gregor Rubinstein, of Russia (b. November 30, 1830; d. November\r\n20, 1894), combined the brilliant pianist with the composer of\r\ngenius. Had he not been preceded by Liszt as an epoch maker, he would\r\nundoubtedly have had the honor of being first of all great pianists.\r\n\r\nFrederic F. Chopin, of Poland (b. March 1, 1809; d. October 17, 1849),\r\nwas one of the first of pianists and musical composers. His playing,\r\nlike his music, was marked by a strange and ravishing grace, and he was\r\nthe great interpreter of the music of his native country. He composed\r\nconcertos, waltzes, nocturnes, preludes, and mazurkas abounding in\r\npoetic fancy and subtle harmonic effects.\r\n\r\nJacques Offenbach, of France (b. June 21, 1819; d. October 4, 1880),\r\nwas the chief creator of the opera bouffe, and was an astonishingly\r\nprolific composer. He stands for the clever, tactful musician, shrewd\r\nto perceive and quick to seize what catches the public ear for the time\r\nbeing.\r\n\r\nFranz Liszt, of Hungary (b. October 22, 1811; d. July 31, 1886), ranks\r\nas one of the world’s phenomenal pianists. His strength and technique\r\nwere prodigious, his magnetism irresistible, and his power over\r\naudiences unequaled. By his free, fantastic compositions he created a\r\nnew school of composers. He gave extraordinary aid and inspiration to\r\nother musicians, and in reality brought Richard Wagner into prominence\r\nbefore the musical world.\r\n\r\nRichard Wagner, of Germany (b. May 22, 1813; d. February 13, 1883),\r\nearly abandoned Beethoven as an operatic model, and felt that a new\r\nera in music was about to dawn. His musical theories first found full\r\nswing in his famous opera of the “Nibelungen Ring,” with which, and\r\nkindred productions, he practically created the modern music-drama. In\r\nhis operas he was sole author of their wonderful wealth of true poetry,\r\nstage effects, dramatic action, and endless melody. No musician has\r\never made such bitter foes and warm friends, and none ever had to fight\r\nhis way so stubbornly to recognition.\r\n\r\nGiuseppe Verdi, of Italy (b. October 9, 1813), is one of the most\r\nremarkable musical composers of the century, in the respect that his\r\ntalent has not failed with age, but has kept pace with the great\r\nchanges which have affected the dramatic stage since his youth. In\r\nthe beauty of his melodies and the intensity of his dramatic powers\r\nhe is unsurpassed. Very few, indeed, of his numerous productions have\r\nfailed to hold exalted place in public estimation. His best-known works\r\nare “Il Trovatore,” “La Traviata,” “Rigoletto,” “Ballo in Maschera,”\r\n“Aïda,” “Otello,” and “Falstaff,” the latter written in 1893, when the\r\nauthor had reached the age of eighty.\r\n\r\nSOVEREIGNS.—William I., King of Prussia and Emperor of Germany, was\r\nthe epoch-maker of the 19th century for his realm. He was son of\r\nFrederick William III., and born March 22, 1797. In 1849 he was made\r\ncommander-in-chief of the Prussian army. He succeeded to the throne of\r\nPrussia in 1861, and immediately under the guidance of Bismarck set\r\nabout those measures which were to end in the unification of the German\r\nstates. These involved the war of 1866 with Austria, after which,\r\nin 1867 he became head of the powerful North German confederation,\r\ncomprising 22 states, and a population of 29,000,000. Then followed the\r\nsuccessful war with France, in 1871, which resulted in the complete\r\nrealization of his idea of a united Germany, and on January 28, 1871,\r\nKing William of Prussia was proclaimed Emperor of Germany, in the\r\npalace of the French kings, at Marseilles. He died March 9, 1888.\r\n\r\nVictor Emmanuel. At the birth of Victor Emmanuel in 1820, Italy was\r\na segregation of states or provinces, owned and played against one\r\nanother by the chess-players of Europe. The policy of ambitious\r\nsovereigns to the north was to keep it divided and discordant. Victor\r\nEmmanuel became king of Sardinia at a time when Austria’s power was\r\nwell-nigh supreme in the belligerent Italian states. His plea with\r\nAustria that the Sardinian constitution should be protected, and its\r\nsuccess, aroused for him the confidence of the Italian people, and\r\npaved his way to the Italian crown. In 1852 he secured the services\r\nof the masterly Count Cavour, the Bismarck and Gladstone of Italy,\r\nfor his premier and guide. Through Cavour’s influence France united\r\nwith Sardinia against Austria. The war which followed and the peace of\r\nVillafranca completed Emmanuel’s task, and made him king of a united\r\nItaly, over which he reigned successfully for eight years, dying on\r\nJanuary 9, 1878.\r\n\r\nCzar Alexander II. The epoch-maker of Russia during the 19th century\r\nwas Alexander II., born April 29, 1818. Of the many important events of\r\nhis reign, which began in 1855, the most illustrious was the abolition\r\nof serfdom in his dominions, which gave freedom to 23,000,000 subjects.\r\nHe was killed by anarchists in 1881.\r\n\r\nFrancis Joseph. This emperor of Austria-Hungary was born August 18,\r\n1830, and succeeded to the throne of Austria in 1848, and of Hungary\r\nin 1867. Though defeated in wars with France, by which he lost Italian\r\nprovinces, and with Germany by which he lost Schleswig-Holstein, he\r\nmanaged through an unprecedently long reign, in some part of which he\r\nwas both emperor and legislature, to hold together an empire composed\r\nof heterogeneous Germans and Slavs, a task that would have proved\r\nimpossible with a less wise and respected ruler. He survived the\r\ncentury, and the question also lived, what of the empire after his\r\ndeath?\r\n\r\nVictoria, Queen and Empress. Alexandrina Victoria Guelph, whose reign\r\nwas the longest in English annals, and covered the epoch-making time\r\nof Great Britain during the nineteenth century, was born in London,\r\nMay 24, 1819. She was the daughter of the Duke of Kent, fourth son\r\nof George III. She became next in succession to the throne on the\r\ndeath of her uncle, King William IV., which occurred June 20, 1837.\r\nHer ancestry dated back to Egbert, A. D. 827. To the wisdom of her\r\nmother she owed a well-ordered, peaceful, and happy childhood, with a\r\nview to the possibility of the English throne. Special teachers were\r\nemployed as her instructors, and she became proficient in music and\r\ndrawing, as well as in the classic and modern languages. She became\r\nequally proficient in the English constitution and general history. In\r\n1831, when, at the age of twelve, it was deemed necessary to acquaint\r\nher with the fact that she was heir presumptive to the throne, the\r\ngenealogical table of the royal family was placed in her book of\r\nhistory. After a study of it, she remarked that she was nearer the\r\nthrone than she had thought, and that the reasons for her course of\r\nmental training had become obvious.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the young princess made her first appearance at court,\r\nand Parliament voted her an additional appropriation of $50,000 a\r\nyear for her expenses. But as a rule her mother made use of the fast\r\nvanishing possibility of the birth of other heirs who would take\r\nprecedence of her, to keep the child, as long as propriety would\r\npermit, out of the whirl of court life, and to allow her education\r\nto proceed without interruption. The consequence of this maternal\r\ndiscretion was that Victoria came to the throne in excellent physical\r\nand mental health.\r\n\r\nShe attained her legal majority—eighteen years—on May 24, 1837,\r\nand her birthday was celebrated throughout the country. On June 20,\r\n1837, King William died childless. It became the immediate duty of\r\nthe Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord Conyngham to inform the young\r\nprincess of her uncle’s death and her own right of accession. She held\r\nout her hand to the Archbishop to be kissed, and said, “I ask your\r\nprayers on my behalf.” A meeting of the privy council was called for\r\neleven o’clock. The princess was known to but few of the members, and\r\nthere was a universal desire to ascertain what manner of person she\r\nmight be. She appeared before this august body of a hundred leading\r\nnobles and statesmen with modest composure, bowed to the lords, took\r\nher seat, and read her declaration. The members of the council were\r\nthen sworn to allegiance, kneeling and kissing her hand. The foreign\r\nambassadors were then received one by one. All were captivated by the\r\neasy dignity of their girl-queen. Her speech was generally remarked\r\nupon for its perfect elocution. Of her speech a few months after,\r\nupon the dissolution of Parliament, Charles Sumner, who heard it,\r\nsaid, “I was astonished and delighted. I think I never heard anything\r\nbetter read.” And of the same speech Fanny Kemble said: “I think it is\r\nimpossible to hear a more excellent utterance than that of the Queen’s\r\nEnglish by the English queen.”\r\n\r\nVictoria promptly reformed her court, which was sadly in need of\r\ncorrection, and removed the royal residence to Windsor Castle. Public\r\nadmiration for her ability and grace of manner grew into enthusiasm, so\r\nthat on the day of her coronation at Westminster Abbey, June 28, 1838,\r\nthe pageant was not only one of unsurpassed splendor, but the populace\r\nwere described as “coronation mad.” This was the manifestation of a\r\nradically changed public sentiment as to royalty, for the eclipse of\r\nmonarchy under the four Georges had long been accepted as a humiliating\r\nfact, and respect for the throne had been well-nigh lost during\r\nWilliam’s reign. Altogether it was a bad time for a girlish queen to\r\nassume power; yet her guiding hand was soon favorably and powerfully\r\nfelt, and it has been said by more than one good authority that her\r\naccession at that special crisis was the salvation of monarchy in Great\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: QUEEN VICTORIA IN 1840.\r\n\r\n(After a painting by Wm. Fowler.)]\r\n\r\nHer prime minister, Lord Melbourne, received at an early date a touch\r\nof her quality, when, after vainly urging her to sign a certain\r\ndocument, he testily withdrew it with the remark that it was not of\r\nparamount importance. “Sir,” replied the queen instantly, “it is with\r\nme a matter of the most paramount importance whether or not I attach\r\nmy signature to a document with which I am not thoroughly acquainted.”\r\nAnd on another occasion, when her signature was asked to a document\r\non the ground of “expediency,” she replied, “I have been taught, My\r\nLord, to judge between what is right and what is wrong, but expediency\r\nis a word I neither wish to hear nor to understand.” The beginning of\r\nher reign was coincident with the inauguration of transatlantic steam\r\nnavigation. In the second year of her reign the Whig ministry, at whose\r\nhead stood Lord Melbourne, lost its working majority in Parliament.\r\nThe queen immediately summoned the Tory leader, Duke of Wellington, to\r\nform a new government. Wellington suggested Sir Robert Peel as better\r\nqualified for the task. He accepted, but when the queen found that the\r\nchange would affect all the ladies of her Bedchamber and household\r\nshe repudiated Peel, and recommissioned Melbourne. For this she and\r\nher premier were taunted as being at the head of what was called the\r\n“Bedchamber Plot.” Subsequently, when Peel succeeded Melbourne, the\r\nqueen found in him and Wellington warm friends and trusted advisers.\r\nAmong the other notable events of this year (1839) of her reign, were\r\nthe formation of the Anti-Corn Law League, and the occupation of Cabul\r\nand Aden by the British forces.\r\n\r\nThe queen’s hand was sought in marriage by many kings, dukes, and\r\nprinces of Europe. Her choice fell upon her cousin, Prince Albert of\r\nSaxe-Coburg and Gotha. It was a love-match, mingled with not a little\r\ndiplomacy on the part of her aunt, the Duchess of Gloucester, and\r\nAlbert’s uncle, King Leopold. The wedding was celebrated with stately\r\nsplendor at the Chapel Royal in St. James’s Palace, on February 10,\r\n1840. The marriage proved a happy one. All that the most affectionate\r\nand unselfish wife could be, she was to her husband. And the Prince\r\nConsort not only returned her affection in full, but became her\r\nfaithful, laborious, vigilant, discreet adviser and helper, lifting\r\nfrom her shoulders the crushing load of state affairs, and opening a\r\nnew era in her life. Careful and well informed observers have ranked\r\nPrince Albert among the statesmen of his day, and some have said that\r\nfor the greater part of his twenty-one years of married life he was\r\npractically King of England.\r\n\r\nOn November 21, 1840, their first child, afterwards Empress Frederick\r\nof Germany, was born. An economic triumph of the year was the\r\nintroduction of cheap postage in England. In 1841 Sir Robert Peel\r\nsucceeded Lord Melbourne as premier. British arms greatly extended\r\npolitical and commercial influence in the Orient by the taking of\r\nCanton and Amoy. On November 9 the Prince of Wales, who, January 23,\r\n1901, succeeded to his mother’s throne, was born. In 1842 two attempts\r\nwere made to assassinate the queen. It became the foreign policy of the\r\ngovernment not to further complicate the Indian question by pushing\r\nconquest in Afghanistan, so the British forces were withdrawn. The\r\ncommercial prestige of England was greatly advanced in the Orient by\r\nthe acquisition of Hong Kong as a port, and the general opening of\r\nall the Chinese ports to foreign trade. This year also witnessed the\r\npermanent foothold of Great Britain in South Africa, by absorbing the\r\nBoer republic of Natal.\r\n\r\nOn April 25, 1843, Princess Alice was born. British possessions in\r\nIndia were enlarged by the annexation of Scinde. The queen and her\r\nhusband paid a friendly visit to Louis Philippe of France, and received\r\na return visit. In 1845 Mr. Gladstone became premier. England and\r\nFrance joined in war against the Argentine republic. The year witnessed\r\nthe outbreak of the formidable Sikh rebellion. In the following year,\r\n1846, this rebellion was suppressed and the Sikh territory was ceded\r\nto the East India Company. The aggravated question of the Northwest\r\nboundary of the United States was settled by treaty. The great famine\r\nin Ireland, and a somewhat indignant public sentiment in England,\r\nconduced to the repeal of the Corn-laws. For several years the Irish\r\nsituation was serious, famine and insurrection going hand in hand. In\r\n1848 Princess Louise was born. The Sikh rebellion was renewed. The Boer\r\nterritory in South Africa was further trenched upon, and the farmers\r\ntrekt across the Vaal River to establish the Transvaal republic. In\r\n1849 the queen paid her first visit to Ireland, the Sikh rebellion\r\nwas suppressed, and the Punjaub was annexed to British India. 1850\r\nwitnessed the conclusion of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty with the United\r\nStates. In 1851 the queen opened the great Exposition in London. In\r\n1852 the first Derby ministry came into power. In 1854 Great Britain\r\nparticipated with France in the Crimean War against Russia. For several\r\nyears the vigorous foreign policy of the government led to serious\r\ncomplications. In 1860 the Prince of Wales visited America. During the\r\nCivil War in the United States, the queen’s sympathies were with the\r\nUnion cause, and the very last public act of the Prince Consort was to\r\nsign in the name of the queen the paper which modified the demand of\r\nthe ministry upon the United States with reference to seizure of the\r\nConfederate envoys Mason and Slidell. The paper in its unmodified form\r\nwould have been equivalent to a declaration of war by England.\r\n\r\nToward the end of 1861 Prince Albert’s strength began to fail, and on\r\nDecember 14 he passed away. His death was a severe blow to the queen\r\nand to the nation. Two years afterwards she wrote in a letter to Dean\r\nStanley, “I can never be sufficiently thankful that I passed safely\r\nthrough those two years [the two first years of her reign] to my\r\nmarriage. Then I was in a safe haven, and there I remained for twenty\r\nyears. Now, that is over, and I am again at sea, always wishing to\r\nconsult one who is not here, groping by myself, with a constant sense\r\nof desolation.”\r\n\r\nIn 1863 the Prince of Wales was married. For several years the\r\ngovernment had serious trouble with the Fenian uprisings in Ireland and\r\nAmerica. In 1867 the Dominion of Canada was constituted. 1868 witnessed\r\na cabinet change from Derby to Disraeli, and from him to Gladstone;\r\nand the passage of a reform act for Scotland and Ireland. In 1874\r\nDisraeli succeeded Gladstone as premier. In 1875 Great Britain acquired\r\ncontrol of the Suez canal, and in 1876 the queen was proclaimed\r\nEmpress of India. In 1879 Great Britain was carrying on war in India\r\nagainst revolting tribes, and in South Africa against the Zulus. Two\r\nyears later (1881) she attacked the Boers of the Transvaal, but met\r\nwith defeat. In 1885 there was a further loss of military prestige\r\nby withdrawal from the Soudan campaign. In 1887 the queen celebrated\r\nher semi-centennial jubilee, and ten years later (1897) her diamond\r\njubilee. In 1900 she witnessed the consolidation of her Australasian\r\ncolonies, and in 1901 the establishment of the Commonwealth of\r\nAustralia. The closing years of her life were clouded by the attitude\r\nof her country in South Africa, and the losses of life and treasure\r\nentailed by the war with the Boers. It was said by many that her\r\nanxiety and grief over this situation hastened her death. Her last\r\nillness was brief and painless, and her death took place at Osborne,\r\nIsle of Wight, surrounded by her family, at 6.55 P.M. on January 22,\r\n1901, in the eighty-second year of her age, and sixty-fourth of her\r\nreign.\r\n\r\nHer death occasioned sincere mourning throughout the civilized world.\r\nShe was succeeded by her oldest son, the Prince of Wales, who ascended\r\nthe throne on January 23, 1901, and assumed the title of Edward VII.\r\nThe queen and Prince Consort were ever anxious as to the education\r\nof their children. They were trained to industry and economy. The\r\ndaughters were taught accomplishments as well as sewing and cooking,\r\nand were given to understand that they were not to marry without\r\naffection, nor for mere money or reasons of state. Victoria was herself\r\na careful manager in pecuniary affairs. By thirty she had saved enough\r\nfrom her income to provide for the whole expense of her new place at\r\nOsborne, where she died,—about $1,000,000,—while for the Prince she\r\nhad already saved from the revenues of her Cornwall estate, $500,000.\r\nThe Prince left her a valuable estate which at her death had come to be\r\nestimated at $25,000,000. This, added to her own judicious investments\r\nthrough the sixty-four years of her reign, gave her rank as one of the\r\nwealthiest of sovereigns, as well as of the world’s persons.\r\n\r\nAlready the “Victorian era” is being celebrated as the greatest period\r\nof progress that Britain ever knew, as the golden age of England.\r\nAnd this with much propriety and truth, for her reign teemed with\r\ninstances of the exercise of power in the form of moral influence,\r\nwith results important and far reaching. Some of these instances\r\nshowed statesmanship of a high order. She never took sides in partisan\r\npolitics, nor antagonized the policy of her responsible ministers,\r\nthough often advising them and even at times correcting their serious\r\nmistakes, never cheapening her advice by offering it in affairs of\r\nlittle moment, always straightforward, self-reliant, vigilant for the\r\nrights of the people, yet strenuous of law, neither misled by flattery,\r\nnor coerced by fear, a hater of evil, a maker of peace. More than\r\nonce, in hours of crisis, did she exercise a moral influence whose\r\nweight turned the course of events in both Europe and America. As an\r\ninstance of this, the modification of Lord Palmerston’s action in the\r\nTrent affair, already mentioned, may be referred to. And when Bismarck,\r\nsurprised at the rapid recovery of France from the effects of the\r\nFranco-Prussian War, had resolved on a second invasion and humiliation,\r\nit was through Victoria’s intervention that the aged German emperor was\r\ninfluenced to refuse a renewal of hostilities.\r\n\r\nIf her reign pass into history as the “Victorian Era,” then it\r\nwill truly have many interesting chapters, some grandly inspiring,\r\nothers—for such there must be—widely open to the criticism and\r\njudgment of posterity. It witnessed the greatest achievement in\r\ninvention, the greatest advancement in science and art, and the most\r\nremarkable evolution in the relations of capital and labor that the\r\nworld has ever seen. No equal period of world-history has seen such\r\nunparalleled growth of a people, and such unexampled expansion of\r\nnational territory. At the beginning of her reign the population of\r\nthe Empire was 127,000,000. At her death it embraced 11,334,000 square\r\nmiles and 384,000,000 people. The United Kingdom itself grew from\r\n16,000,000 to 40,000,000 besides sending out its swarms of emigrants\r\nto people continents and isles. Commerce kept even pace with this\r\nadvancement. British ships sailed every sea. England’s flag was known\r\nin every port of the world. During Victoria’s reign the foreign trade\r\nof Great Britain increased 420 per cent. The great cloud on the\r\nVictorian era was England’s wars,—the questionable Crimean War of\r\n1853–55; the Indian mutiny of 1857, which ran a frightful course of\r\nrapine and bloodshed; the Soudanese campaign; the Boer War in South\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s Notes\r\n\r\n\r\nPunctuation and spelling were made consistent when a predominant\r\npreference was found in this book; otherwise they were not changed.\r\n\r\nSimple typographical errors were corrected; occasional unbalanced\r\nquotation marks retained.\r\n\r\nAmbiguous hyphens at the ends of lines were retained; occurrences of\r\ninconsistent hyphenation have not been changed.\r\n\r\nMany of the original illustrations were grainy and faded. In this\r\neBook, the graininess has been reduced, when possible, and the contrast\r\nhas been increased, when necessary.\r\n\r\nText frequently uses either “De” or “de” in people’s names.\r\n\r\nThe List of Illustrations had “Christmas Chimes” and “Whispers of\r\nLove” in the wrong sequence; corrected here.\r\n\r\nThe List of Illustrations omitted the portrait of Queen Victoria. It\r\nhas been added by the Transcriber.\r\n\r\n“Van’t Hoff” is consistently printed that way in the original book,\r\nand is shown that way here. It should be “Van ’t Hoff” with a space.\r\nThere may be similar misprints of other names.\r\n\r\nPage 109: “growth—force” may be a misprint for “growth-force”.\r\n\r\nPage 192: Most of the illustration’s handwriting on this page is\r\nillegible.\r\n\r\nPage 199: In the chemical formula “CH2”, the “2” is subscripted.\r\n\r\nPage 403: “Bauken” was printed that way; probably refers to “Bautzen.”\r\n\r\nPage 527: The illustrated examples of the letters of the alphabet in\r\nthe “Child’s Guide” were not in alphabetic order, and there was no\r\nexample for “J”. In this eBook, the text accompanying those examples is\r\npresented in alphabetic sequence.\r\n\r\nPage 721: “Marseilles” was printed that way; must be a misprint for\r\n“Versailles.”\r\n\r\nThe tables on pages 445, 450, and 467 have been split in this version\r\nof the eBook to keep their widths within 72 characters.",
