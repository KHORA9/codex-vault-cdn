W. Ziegler &. Company, Publishers,\r\n720 Chestnut Street.\r\n1890.\r\n\r\nEntered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1880, by\r\nJohn Algernon Owens,\r\nIn the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo apology will be required from the author for presenting to the public\r\nsome episodes in the useful career of a self-made man; and while the\r\nspirit of patriotism continues to animate the sturdy sons of America,\r\nthe story of one of them who has exemplified this national trait in a\r\nconspicuous measure, will be deemed not unworthy of record. The lessons\r\nit teaches, more especially to the young, are those of uncompromising\r\n_duty_ in every relation of life--self-denial, perseverance and \"pluck;\"\r\nwhile the successive stages of a course which led ultimately to a\r\nbrilliant success, may be studied with some advantage by those just\r\nentering upon the business of life. As a soldier, Willard Glazier was\r\n\"without fear and without reproach.\" As an author, it is sufficient to\r\nsay, he is appreciated by his _contemporaries_--than which, on a\r\nliterary man, no higher encomium can be passed. The sale of nearly half\r\na million copies of one of his productions is no slight testimony to its\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nBiography, to be interesting, must be a transcript of an eventful, as\r\nwell as a remarkable career; and to be instructive, its subject should\r\nbe exemplary in his aims, and in his mode of attaining them. The hero of\r\nthis story comes fully up to the standard thus indicated. His career has\r\nbeen a romance. Born of parents of small means but of excellent\r\ncharacter and repute; and bred and nurtured in the midst of some of the\r\nwildest and grandest scenery in the rugged county of St. Lawrence,\r\nclose by the \"Thousand Isles,\" where New York best proves her right to\r\nbe called the Empire State through the stamp of royalty on her hills and\r\nstreams--under the shadow of such surroundings as these, my subject\r\nattained maturity, with no opportunities for culture except those he\r\nmade for himself. Yet he became possessed of an education eminently\r\nuseful, essentially practical and calculated to establish just such\r\nhabits of self-reliance and decision as afterwards proved chiefly\r\ninstrumental in his success. Glazier had a fixed ambition to rise. He\r\nfelt that the task would be difficult of accomplishment--that he must be\r\nnot only the architect, but the builder of his own fortunes; and, as the\r\nstatue grows beneath the sculptor's hand to perfect contour from the\r\nunshapely block of marble, so prosperity came to Captain Glazier only\r\nafter he had cut and chiseled away at the hard surface of inexorable\r\ncircumstance, and moulded therefrom the statue of his destiny.\r\n\r\n                                                               J.

 Lineage of Willard Glazier.--A good stock.--Oliver Glazier at the\r\n    Battle of Bunker Hill.--The home of honest industry.--The Coronet\r\n    of Pembroke.--The \"Homestead Farm.\"--Mehitable Bolton.--Her New\r\n    England home.--Her marriage to Ward Glazier.--The wild \"North\r\n    Woods.\"--The mother of the soldier-author.\r\n\r\nWillard Glazier comes of the mixed blood of Saxon and of Celt. We first\r\nhear of his ancestors upon this side of the Atlantic at that period of\r\nour nation's history which intervened between the speck of war at\r\nLexington and the cloud of war at Bunker Hill.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts and the town of Boston had become marked objects of the\r\ndispleasure of the British Parliament. Later, in 1775, Ethan Allen had\r\nstartled Captain Delaplace by presenting his lank figure at the\r\ncaptain's bedside and demanding the surrender of Ticonderoga in the name\r\nof the \"Great Jehovah and the Continental Congress.\" In the language of\r\nDaniel Webster, \"A spirit pervaded all ranks, not transient, not\r\nboisterous, but deep, solemn, determined.\"\r\n\r\nWar on their own soil and at their own doors was indeed a strange work\r\nto the yeomanry of New England; but their consciences were convinced of\r\nits necessity, and when their country called them to her defense they\r\ndid not withhold themselves from the perilous responsibility.\r\n\r\nThe statement of Quincy seemed to pervade all hearts. Said that\r\ndistinguished son of genius and patriotism, \"Blandishments will not\r\nfascinate us, nor will threats of a halter intimidate; for, under God,\r\nwe are determined that, wheresoever, whensoever, and howsoever we shall\r\nbe called to make our exit, we will die free men.\"\r\n\r\nAt such a time, and among such men, we find enrolled in the ranks of the\r\npatriot army Oliver Glazier, the great-grandfather of the subject of the\r\npresent biography.\r\n\r\nOliver's father was John Glazier, a Massachusetts Lancastrian, born in\r\n1739. John Glazier was the son of William Glazier, born about the year\r\n1700, his ancestry being respectively of English and of Scotch\r\nextraction. Oliver himself, however, was born in the town of Lancaster,\r\nin the province or colony of Massachusetts, May twenty-third, 1763.\r\n\r\nHence the blood of Norman, of Saxon and of Celt, that had forgotten the\r\nanimosities of race and mingled quietly in the veins of his ancestors,\r\nhad become purely American in Oliver, and though but little over\r\nfourteen years of age, we find him doing yeoman service upon the\r\nramparts of Bunker Hill.\r\n\r\nThat he performed well his part in the struggle for liberty, is evident\r\nfrom the fact that he appears upon the rolls as a pensioner, from the\r\nclose of that memorable contest until the time of his death.\r\n\r\nMr. Frank Renehan, in a sketch contributed by him to an elaborate work\r\nwhich was published by the New York and Hartford Publishing Company in\r\n1871, comments as follows upon the coincidence of Oliver Glazier in 1775\r\nand Willard Glazier in 1861--both being at the time of entering service\r\ncomparatively boys in age, enlisting for the defense of their country:\r\n\"The former, though then but fourteen years of age, participated with\r\nthe patriots in the battle of Bunker Hill, and to the last contributed\r\nhis young enthusiasm and willing services to the cause he had espoused;\r\nthus giving early testimony of his devotion to the land of his adoption\r\nand of fealty to the principles of popular government involved in the\r\nstruggle for American independence. So remarkable an instance of\r\nancestral fidelity to the interests of civil liberty could not but\r\nexercise a marked influence upon those of the same blood to whom the\r\ntradition was handed down, and here we find our subject, a scion of the\r\nthird generation, assisting in 1861 on the battlefields of the South, in\r\nmaintenance of the liberty his progenitor had contributed to achieve in\r\n1775 on the battlefields of the North! This is not mentioned as a\r\nsingular fact--history is replete with just such coincidences,--but\r\nmerely for the purpose of suggesting the moral that, in matters of\r\npatriotism, the son is only consistent when he imitates the example and\r\nemulates the virtues of his sires.\"\r\n\r\nIn this eloquent passage occurs an error of fact. Oliver Glazier while\r\nin the patriot army was _not_ fighting for the \"land of his adoption.\"\r\nAs we have seen, he was native here and \"to the manor born.\" Indeed, in\r\nthe light of historic proof and with the example of men descended from\r\nWashington and Light Horse Harry Lee before us, we are rather inclined\r\nto admire the paragraph as a fine specimen of rhetorical composition\r\nthan to admit its accuracy as a deduction in philosophy.\r\n\r\nSubsequent to his term of military service--an experience through which\r\nhe had safely passed--Oliver Glazier became a resident of West Boylston,\r\nMassachusetts, where he married a Miss Hastings.\r\n\r\nThe name of Glazier, Lower tells us, is purely English, and is derived\r\nfrom the title given to the trade. However that may be, those who have\r\nborne it have always expressed a pride in having sprung from the great\r\nmass--the people--and have held with the philosopher of Sunnyside, that\r\nwhether \"hereditary rank be an illusion or not, hereditary virtue gives\r\na patent of nobility beyond all the blazonry of the herald's college.\"\r\nThe name of Hastings takes its rise from a nobler source; for Mrs.\r\nOliver Glazier brought into the family as blue blood as any in all\r\nEngland. The great family which bears that name in Great Britain can\r\nshow quarterings of an earlier date than the battle which gave a kingdom\r\nto William of Normandy. Macaulay says that one branch of their line, in\r\nthe fourteenth century, \"wore the coronet of Pembroke; that from another\r\nsprang the renowned Lord Chamberlain, the faithful adherent of the White\r\nRose, whose fate has furnished so striking a theme both to the poet and\r\nhistorian,\" and while it is probable that this wife of an American\r\npatriot was many degrees removed from the powerful leaders whose name\r\nshe bore, the same blood undoubtedly flowed in her veins that coursed\r\nthrough theirs.\r\n\r\nOliver, during the many years of a happy married life which terminated\r\nin his death at the ripe age of ninety-seven, became the father of\r\neight children. His son Jabez left Boylston at an early age, and after\r\nconsiderable \"prospecting\" finally married a Miss Sarah Tucker and\r\nsettled in the township of Fowler, St. Lawrence County, New York. Out of\r\ntheir union sprang three sons, George, Ward, and Henry, and four\r\ndaughters, Elvira, Martha, Caroline and Lydia. During a visit he made to\r\nhis \"down East\" relations, Ward married a young lady by the name of\r\nMehitable Bolton, of West Boylston, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nThis young lady was a true representative of the New England woman, who\r\nbelieves that work is the handmaid of religion. She entered a cotton\r\nfactory at Worcester when only seventeen years of age, and worked\r\nperseveringly through long years of labor, often walking from her home\r\nin West Boylston to the factory at Worcester, a distance of seven miles.\r\nAt the time of her marriage--which occurred when she was\r\ntwenty-five--she had accumulated the snug little sum of five hundred\r\ndollars, besides possessing a handsome wardrobe, all of which was the\r\nfruit of her own untiring industry.\r\n\r\nIf it be true that the mothers of men of mark are always women of strong\r\nand noble characters, then we are not surprised to find in the mother of\r\nWillard Glazier those sterling qualities which made her young life\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nThe early married life of Ward Glazier was passed upon the farm first\r\ncleared and cultivated by his father, and which has since become known\r\nto the neighborhood as the \"Old Glazier Homestead.\" This farm is\r\nsituated in the township of Fowler, midway between the small villages of\r\nLittle York and Fullersville.\r\n\r\nThe township is a tract of rugged land, containing only the little\r\nvillage of Hailesborough, besides those already named. Along its borders\r\nrushes and tumbles a turbulent stream which still retains its original\r\nIndian appellation--the Oswegatchie; a name no doubt conveying to the\r\near of its aboriginal sponsors some poetical conceit, just as another\r\nstream in far off Virginia is named the Shenandoah, or \"Daughter of the\r\nStars.\"\r\n\r\nThose who are at all familiar with the scenery that prevails in what in\r\nother sections of the country are called the great North Woods, and in\r\ntheir own neighborhood the great South Woods, can readily imagine what\r\nwere the geological and scenic peculiarities of Fowler township. Bare,\r\nsterile, famished-looking, as far as horticultural and herbaceous crops\r\nare concerned, yet rich in pasture and abounding in herds--with vast\r\nrocks crested and plumed with rich growths of black balsam, maple, and\r\nspruce timber, and with huge boulders scattered carelessly over its\r\nsurface and margining its streams, St. Lawrence County presents to-day\r\nfeatures of savage grandeur as wild and imposing as it did ere the foot\r\nof a trapper had profaned its primeval forests.\r\n\r\nYet its farms and its dwellings are numerous, its villages and towns\r\npossess all the accompaniments of modern civilization, the spires of its\r\nchurches indicate that the gentle influences of religion are not\r\nforgotten, and there, as elsewhere, the indomitable will of man has won\r\nfrom the wilderness a living and a home.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Birth-place Of Willard Glazier.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIRTH AND CHILDHOOD OF WILLARD GLAZIER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The infant stranger.--A mother's prayers.--\"Be just before you are\r\n    generous.\"--Careful training.--Willard Glazier's first battle.--A\r\n    narrow escape.--Facing the foe.--The happy days of\r\n    childhood.--\"The boy is father to the man.\"\r\n\r\nThe Glazier Homestead, as we have said, is upon the main road leading\r\nfrom Little York to Fullerville. It is a substantial and comfortable\r\nfarm-house, with no pretension to architectural beauty, but,\r\nnevertheless, is a sightly object in a pleasant landscape. Standing back\r\ntwo hundred feet from the road, in a grove of gigantic elms, with a\r\nlimpid brook of spring water a short distance to the right, and rich\r\nfields of herd grass stretching off rearwards towards the waters of the\r\nOswegatchie, which hurry along on their journey of forty miles to the\r\nSt. Lawrence River, the old house is sure to attract the attention of\r\nthe traveller, and to be long remembered as a picture of solid and\r\nsubstantial comfort.\r\n\r\nIn this old house, upon the morning of August twenty-second, 1841, to\r\nWard Glazier and Mehitable, his wife, a son was born who was\r\nsubsequently named Willard. The father and mother were by no means\r\nsentimental people--they were certainly not given to seeing the poetical\r\nside of life; they were plain, earnest people, rough hewn out of the\r\ncoarse fibre of Puritanism, but the advent of this little child brought\r\na joy to their hearts that had its softening influence upon the home in\r\nwhich he was to be reared.\r\n\r\nThe thoroughness of Ward Glazier's nature, that conscientiousness in\r\nexcess which made him radical in all things, was of the _heart_ as well\r\nas of the head, and though not a demonstrative man, the intensity of his\r\npaternal love cropped out in many ways. As to his wife, hers was truly\r\n\"mother's love.\" And what notes are there attuned to sacred music, in\r\nall the broad vocabulary of the English tongue, which gives any idea of\r\nthe sentiment that links a woman to her babe, except the three simple\r\nsyllables, \"mother's love!\" Brooding over the tiny stranger, ready to\r\nlaugh or cry; exultant with hope and pride, despondent with fear,\r\nquivering with anguish if the \"wind of heaven doth visit its cheek too\r\nroughly,\" and singing hosannas of joy when it lisps the simpler\r\nsyllables that she so patiently has taught, covering it with the broad\r\nwing of her measureless affection, and lavishing upon it such \"sighs as\r\nperfect joy perplexed for utterance, steals from her sister sorrow,\"\r\nthere is nothing except God's own illimitable affection for his\r\ncreatures, that can rival in depth and strength and comprehensiveness, a\r\nmother's love.\r\n\r\nThe heart of Ward Glazier's wife, at this time, blossomed in absolutely\r\nrank luxuriance with this feeling, and ran riot in the joy of its\r\npossession; but she determined within herself that it should be no blind\r\nor foolish worship. It grew, therefore, into a sober, careful, provident\r\naffection.\r\n\r\nQuiet and unobtrusive in manner, her face always wore a look of gravity\r\nbefitting one who felt that God had entrusted to her charge a fresh\r\nhuman soul to mould for good or evil. She fully realized the fact that\r\nher son would grow up with honor or sink down into ignominy just as she\r\nshould guide or spoil him in his youth. She quite comprehended the\r\nstubborn truth, that while the father to some extent may shape the\r\noutward career of his son, the mother is responsible for the coloring of\r\nhis inner life: and that\r\n\r\n    \"All we learn of good is learned in youth,\r\n    When passion's heat is pure, when love is truth.\"\r\n\r\nThough of Puritan stock, though reared in the austere faith of John\r\nKnox, there was nothing hard or harsh in this mother's character, and\r\nstill less was there anything of the materialist about her. She would\r\nhave utterly scouted the doctrine of Cabanis and his school, which held\r\nthat the physical was the whole structure of man; that all instincts,\r\npassions, thoughts, emanated from the body; that sensibility is an\r\neffect of the nervous system, that passion is an emanation of the\r\nviscera, that intellect is nothing more than a cerebral secretion, and\r\n\"self-consciousness but a general faculty of living matter.\" She had\r\ndrunk inspiration of a different kind from her infancy. In her New\r\nEngland home the very atmosphere was charged with religious influences.\r\nShe was taught, or rather she had learned without a teacher, not only to\r\nsee God in the flowers and in the stars, but to recognize his immediate\r\nagency in all things terrestrial.\r\n\r\nNight after night, listening to the tremulous tones of her father as he\r\nread a lesson from the sacred page, not only to those of his own blood,\r\nbut to his \"man-servant, his maid-servant, and the stranger within his\r\ngates,\" she had felt the presence of a tangible God, and when, at last,\r\nshe followed the fortunes of the chosen one of her heart far into the\r\ngreat North Woods, nature spoke to her from the forest and the cataract,\r\ndeepening each early impression and intensifying each early belief,\r\nuntil she realized as a living fact that the \"Lord was ever in his holy\r\ntemple\" and that his temple was the universe.\r\n\r\nTo a woman like this every act of life became a matter of conscience,\r\nand the training of her child of course became such to Mrs. Glazier. She\r\nhad watched the pitfalls which the \"world, the flesh and the\r\ndevil\"--that trinity of evil--provide for the feet of the unwary, and\r\nshe determined that young Willard's steps, if she could prevent it,\r\nshould never stray that way.\r\n\r\nHer husband took life and its duties much more easily. He was less rigid\r\nin his sense of parental responsibility. While a man of great rectitude\r\nof purpose, he was good-natured to a fault--somewhat improvident,\r\ncareless of money, ever ready to extend aid to the needy, and especially\r\ndisinclined to the exercise of harshness in his home, even when the\r\nstern element of authority was needed. In short, he was one of those\r\nbig-hearted men who are so brimful of the \"milk of human kindness\" that\r\nthe greatest pain they ever feel is the pain they see others suffer. His\r\nplan therefore was, spare the rod even if you _do_ spoil the child.\r\n\r\nBut--perhaps fortunately for young Willard--Mrs. Glazier held different\r\nviews. From his very infancy she endeavored to instil into his nature\r\nhabits of truthfulness, industry and thrift. \"Never waste and never lie\"\r\nwas her pet injunction. Her aim was not to make her son a generous, but\r\na _just_ man. \"One hour of justice is worth an eternity of prayer,\"\r\nsays the Arabian proverb, but Mrs. Glazier, while she exalted justice as\r\nthe greatest of the virtues, also believed that in order to make man's\r\nheart its temple, prayer was an absolutely necessary pre-requisite. She\r\nlikewise endeavored from the first to habituate the boy's mind to\r\nreflect upon the value of money and the uses of economy. She would have\r\n\"coined her blood for drachms\" if that would have benefited her husband\r\nor her son. Her savings were not spent upon herself, but in the hard\r\nschool of a bitter experience she had learned that money means much more\r\nthan dollars and cents--that its possession involves the ability to live\r\na life of honor, untempted by the sordid solicitations that clamor round\r\nthe poor man's door and wring the poor man's heart.\r\n\r\nThe result was that as soon as he began to comprehend her words, young\r\nWillard had impressed upon his memory maxims eulogizing all who practise\r\nhabits of sobriety, industry and frugality, and denunciatory of all who\r\nfail to do so.\r\n\r\nHis mother never wearied of teaching him such sayings of Dr. Franklin as\r\nthese: \"Time is money,\" \"Credit is money,\" \"Money begets money,\" \"The\r\ngood paymaster is lord of another man's purse,\" and \"The sound of a\r\nman's hammer heard by his creditor at six o'clock in the morning makes\r\nhim easy six months longer, while the sound of his voice heard in a\r\ntavern, induces him to send for his money the next day;\" \"Trifling items\r\naggregate into large totals,\" while the text that ruled the house was\r\nthat of the Scripture, \"If any would not work neither should he eat.\"\r\n\r\nThe effect of the constant teaching of such lessons was not however\r\nperceptible in the lad's habits in very early life. He was no model\r\nlittle boy, no monster of perfection--he was like the boys that we see\r\naround us every day--not one of the marvels we read about. But the seed\r\nwas sown in his soul which was destined to quicken into fruit in after\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nAt the early age of four years his mother began to teach him to read and\r\nwrite, and under her loving tuition he acquired a knowledge of these two\r\nbranches of culture quite rapidly.\r\n\r\nJust about this time an incident occurred which came near finishing\r\nyoung Willard's career in a manner as sudden as it would have been\r\nsingular.\r\n\r\nThe \"Homestead Farm\" was at that time pretty well stocked for a place\r\nonly containing one hundred and forty acres, and among the cattle was a\r\nsturdy Alderney bull whose reputation for peace and quietness was\r\nunusually good.\r\n\r\nOn a certain morning, however, early in the spring of the year 1845,\r\nyoung Master Willard happened to overhear a conversation between two of\r\nthe farm hands, in the course of which one of them declared that \"old\r\nBlackface was tarin' round mighty lively.\" This statement interested the\r\nlad to such an extent that he concluded to go and see how this \"tarin'\r\nround\" was done.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, taking advantage of a moment when his mother's attention\r\nwas occupied, he started for the barnyard, into which Mr. Bull had been\r\nturned only a few moments before. Now as young Willard was somewhat\r\nsmaller than the visitors our bovine friend was in the habit of\r\nreceiving, such an unwarrantable intrusion was not to be tolerated for\r\na moment. Accordingly, no sooner had Willard set his little feet within\r\nthe enclosure of the barn-yard than the bull gave a roar of rage, and\r\ncatching the boy on the tips of his horns, which fortunately were\r\nbuttoned, sent him twenty feet up in the air, preparing to trample him\r\nout of existence when he should come down. Luckily some of the men were\r\nattracted to the scene, who secured his bullship and rescued the child.\r\nWillard was not seriously hurt, and the instant he regained his feet, he\r\nturned round, shook his tiny fist at the now retreating animal and\r\nshouted out in a shrill treble, \"When I get to be a big man I'll toss\r\nyou in the air!\"\r\n\r\nHaving thus taken the bull by the horns in a literal as well as\r\nfigurative sense, the lad began gradually to develop into that terrible\r\nembodiment of unrest--a boy. He exhibited no very marked peculiarities\r\nup to this time to distinguish him from other youths; but just grew into\r\nthe conglomerate mass of good, bad and indifferent qualities which go to\r\nmake up the ordinary flesh-and-blood boy--brimful of mischief and\r\nimpatient of restraint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY LIFE AND HABITS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Scotch-Irish Presbyterianism of twenty-five years ago.--The \"little\r\n    deacon.\"--First days at school.--Choosing a wife.--A youthful\r\n    gallant.--A close scholar but a wild lad.--A mother's\r\n    influence.--Ward Glazier a Grahamite.--Young Willard's practical\r\n    jokes.--Anecdote of Crystal Spring.--\"That is something like\r\n    water.\"\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that young Willard's home was gloomy and\r\njoyless, because it was presided over by a religious woman. The\r\nPresbyterians of that day and that race were by no means a lugubrious\r\npeople. They did not necessarily view their lives as a mere vale of\r\ntears, nor did they think the \"night side of nature\" the most sacred\r\none. The Rev. Mr. Morrison, one of their divines, tells us that \"the\r\nthoughtless, the grave, the old and the young, alike enjoyed every\r\nspecies of wit,\" and though they were \"thoughtful, serious men, yet they\r\nnever lost an occasion that might promise sport,\" and he very\r\npertinently asks, \"what other race ever equaled them in getting up\r\ncorn-huskings, log-rollings and quiltings?--and what hosts of queer\r\nstories are connected with them!\" Fond of fun, there was a grotesque\r\nhumor about them, which in its way has, perhaps, never been equaled.\r\n\r\n\"It was the sternness of the Scotch Covenanter softened by a century's\r\nresidence abroad, amid persecution and trial, united to the comic humor\r\nand pathos of the Irish, and then grown wild in the woods among their\r\nown New England mountains.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The First Battle.]\r\n\r\nSuch was the Scotch-Irish Presbyterianism of that period.\r\n\r\nOther cheerful influences were also at work in the two villages that\r\ncomprised the town of Fowler. The only house of worship in the town\r\nproper was a Universalist church, and the people were compelled for the\r\nmost part, notwithstanding their various creeds, to worship in a common\r\ntemple where the asperities of sectarian difference had no existence.\r\n\r\nWard Glazier, at that time, was an adherent of Universalism, while his\r\nwife held evangelical views. But he was ever ready to ride with his wife\r\nand son to the church of her choice at Gouverneur, a distance of six\r\nmiles, and returning, chat with them pleasantly of the sermon, the\r\ncrops, the markets and the gossip of the town.\r\n\r\nIn truth, young Willard's early home was a good and pleasant one, and\r\nhaving learned, under his mother's careful training, to read exceedingly\r\nwell, for a boy of his age, by the time he reached his fourth year he\r\nbecame noted for his inquiring disposition, his quiet manner, and a\r\nquaint habit of making some practical application of the \"wise saws\"\r\nwith which his mother had stored his juvenile mind.\r\n\r\nThe result was that up to this period of his existence he was an\r\nold-fashioned little fellow, and somehow had acquired the sobriquet of\r\nthe \"little deacon.\"\r\n\r\nAt about five years of age, however, a change took place in the boy.\r\n\r\nThe bird that flutters and twitters in the parent nest is a very\r\ndifferent thing from the emancipated fledgeling, feeling its newly\r\nacquired power of flight, and soaring far up and out into the woods and\r\nover the fields; and the boy whose experience of life is confined to\r\nthe household of his parents, is not less different from the lad who has\r\ngone beyond it into the bustle and turmoil of that epitomized world,--a\r\npublic school.\r\n\r\nLittle Willard, like other youths, was thrown into this new sphere of\r\naction suddenly, and without any adequate idea of what was there\r\nexpected of him. The first day passed as all first days at school pass,\r\nnot in study, but in looking on and becoming accustomed to the\r\nsurroundings, himself in turn being the subject of scrutiny by his\r\nschool-mates, as the \"new boy.\" The day did not end, however, without\r\nits incident.\r\n\r\nYoung Willard as soon as he had made his bow to his new teacher, was\r\nplaced upon a bench in close proximity to a pretty little girl of about\r\nhis own age. Instead of wasting his time therefore, by studying the less\r\nattractive lineaments of his male companions, he made a careful\r\ncomparison between this young lady and the other girls present, the\r\nresult of which was that the moment he was permitted to go out during\r\nthe customary recess, he bounded off home at the top of his speed, and\r\nwith all the exuberance natural to his years announced to his astonished\r\nmother, \"Mother! mother! I've picked out my wife!\"\r\n\r\nSusceptibility to the influence of beauty seems, at this period of\r\nWillard's life, to have been one of his prominent characteristics, for\r\nin addition to exhibiting itself in the manner described, upon another\r\noccasion not long afterwards it broke out as follows:\r\n\r\nEvery school-boy is aware that there is nothing so humiliating to a male\r\npupil at a public school as to be called a \"girl-boy.\" Hence, for\r\ntrivial offences a boy is often punished by being sandwiched between two\r\ngirls, and compelled to remain there until the offence committed has\r\nbeen sufficiently atoned for. Now young Willard was frequently guilty of\r\ntalking during study hours, and his teacher determined to try this\r\nspecies of punishment upon him with a view of correcting the offensive\r\nhabit. As soon, therefore, as he caught him indulging in the prohibited\r\npractice, he was ordered to take his place between two very young ladies\r\nof six and eight summers respectively. To the amazement of his teacher,\r\nyoung Willard sustained the infliction smilingly, and believing that\r\nthis was an indication that the culprit recognized the justice of the\r\npunishment and was practising a commendable patience, he very soon\r\ncalled him up to his own desk, reasoned with him upon the necessity of\r\nobserving the rules of school, and released him with an admonition to be\r\ncareful for the future, as a repetition of his offence would certainly\r\nbe followed by a repetition of the punishment.\r\n\r\nWillard said nothing, but went to his desk, and for the space of five\r\nminutes, perhaps, there was complete silence in the school-room. Then\r\nMr. ---- was startled to hear a distinct, clear, unmistakable whisper\r\nbreak in upon his meditations, and became as suddenly struck with the\r\nconviction that it was uttered by Master Willard Glazier.\r\n\r\nThe countenance of the pedagogue grew dark and stern. Fire shot from his\r\nusually calm eyes, and his expression betokened the fact that this\r\nflagrant act of disobedience was more than he could bear. Indignation\r\nhowever soon gave place to astonishment, for the little fellow, without\r\nwaiting for a single word from his teacher's lips, quietly arose to his\r\nfeet, and with the placid expression of an individual performing a\r\nmeritorious action, marched across the school-room and deliberately\r\nseated himself in the place he had before occupied between the two\r\nlittle girls.\r\n\r\n\"Willard Glazier!\" thundered the master, \"come here, sir, immediately!\"\r\n\r\nThe boy of course instantly obeyed.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, sir!\" exclaimed the teacher, \"how dare you conduct\r\nyourself in this disgraceful manner, sir!\"\r\n\r\nYoung Willard looked astonished.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Mr. ----,\" said he, \"didn't you say that if I whispered to Myron\r\nSprague again, I should go back and sit between Lizzie and Annie?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, I did, and how dare you disobey me in this way?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, sir,\" said Willard, \"I whispered again to him, because,\r\nsir,--because--I like to sit there, sir.\"\r\n\r\nA light dawned upon the mind of the master, and thereafter he adopted a\r\nless attractive mode of punishing Willard's offences. To some of my\r\nreaders such incidents may seem too trivial for record, and no doubt\r\nsuch days as these _are_ foolish days, but are they not in our memories,\r\namong our very happiest too? As David Copperfield said of such, so say\r\nwe, that \"of all my time that Time has in his grip, there's none at\r\nwhich I smile so much, or think of half so kindly.\"\r\n\r\nThe usual surroundings of a public school made a great change in the\r\nexistence of Willard Glazier, and it is necessary to note its influence,\r\nfor in writing the life of a man in its private as well as its public\r\nrelations, the chief point to be considered is that which men call\r\n_character_, and how it was formed and fashioned.\r\n\r\nIf the truth must be told, the \"little deacon\" had not been a month in\r\nattendance at school before he was up to every imaginable species of\r\nmischief that the fertile brain of a school-boy could conceive--provided\r\nits execution did not involve unequivocal untruth or palpable\r\ndishonesty.\r\n\r\nNo human being, save one, was exempt from his practical jokes. That one\r\nwas his mother. In his wildest moods, a glance of reproach from her\r\nwould check him. His father, however, enjoyed no such immunity, and in a\r\nkindly way, he delighted in tormenting the good man whenever the\r\nopportunity offered.\r\n\r\nFor instance, that worthy gentleman, among other idiosyncracies, was a\r\nfollower of the so-called Dr. Sylvester Graham, an ex-Presbyterian\r\nclergyman who, in 1832, inaugurated, by a familiar course of lectures, a\r\nnew system of dietetics.\r\n\r\nThe Grahamites, as they were called, held that health is the necessary\r\nresult of obeying certain physical laws, and disease the equally certain\r\nresult of disobeying them; that all stimulants are pernicious to the\r\nhuman body, and should be rejected, except in those rare cases where it\r\nbecomes necessary to administer one known poison as an antidote to\r\nanother equally deadly, in order to neutralize its effects or expel it\r\nfrom the system. Dr. Graham condemned the use of tea, coffee and spices,\r\ntobacco, opium, and not only alcoholic drinks but even beer and cider,\r\ndeclaring that all were equally poisonous, and that they only differed\r\nin the degree in which their evil qualities were concentrated or\r\nexpanded.\r\n\r\nWard Glazier held this theory to be the result of a profound philosophy,\r\nand considered the observance of the course of diet he prescribed to be\r\nthe only way in which a human being could secure for himself a sound\r\nmind in a sound body. In medicine, Mr. Glazier was an equally rigid\r\nhydropathist. He held that the system of water cure was the only\r\nrational system of healing. One of his individual fancies was to drink\r\nonly water obtained from a particular spring. This spring was\r\nbeautifully clear and cold, and was situated at the distance of about\r\nsixty rods from the house. It was Willard's allotted duty each day to\r\nfill a large pitcher from its crystal treasures for use at meals. In\r\norder to do this, the brooklet being extremely shallow, and running over\r\nmasses of pebbles, he was compelled to kneel and dip it up with a\r\ncup,--an operation requiring both time and patience. Now within a few\r\nyards of this place flowed a small stream or creek considerably deeper\r\nand of larger volume, fed by a number of rills, and as the boy had\r\nconceived the impression that his father only fancied a distinction\r\nwhere there was really no difference, between the waters of the rival\r\nstreams, it occurred to him that he might just as well plunge his\r\npitcher in the latter, fill it by a single effort, and thus save himself\r\nwhat he especially disliked,--useless labor. This he did with the\r\nfollowing result:\r\n\r\nWard Glazier was just about sitting down to dinner as Willard entered,\r\nand observing that his son came from the immediate vicinity of the\r\ncreek, poured out and tasted a little of the water with evident\r\ndissatisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"Willard,\" said he, \"you didn't get this from the spring; this is creek\r\nwater. Now go right back and get a pitcherful from the spring.\"\r\n\r\nOff started Master Willard to do as he was bidden, but on his way, the\r\noriginator of all mischief suggested to his fertile brain the idea of\r\nplaying a trick upon his father; so instead of going to the spring, he\r\nsimply loitered for a few moments out of sight of such of the family as\r\nmight be at the windows,\r\n\r\n    \"Under an elm whose antique roots peep out\r\n    Upon the brook, that brawls along the wood.\"\r\n\r\nHe then quietly sauntered back, with the identical pitcher of water with\r\nwhich he had come forth.\r\n\r\n\"There,\" said he, emphatically, as if he had fulfilled his mission, at\r\nthe same time placing the pitcher near his father's plate upon the\r\ntable. The good man took it up, examined the contents with a critical\r\neye, poured out a glassful of the sparkling liquid and drained it to the\r\nlast drop.\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said he, with a sigh expressive of great satisfaction, \"_that_ is\r\nsomething like water! _that_ does a man good!\"\r\n\r\nThis evidence of parental fallibility Master Willard enjoyed hugely, but\r\nit was many years before he ventured to give his father an opportunity\r\nto join in the laugh at his own expense, by telling him of the\r\noccurrence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLARD GLAZIER AT SCHOOL.\r\n\r\n\r\n  School-days continued.--Boys will be boys.--Cornelius Carter, the\r\n    teacher.--Young Willard's rebellion against\r\n    injustice.--Gum-chewing.--Laughable race through the snow.--The\r\n    tumble into a snow-bank, and what came of it.--The runaway\r\n    caught.--Explanation and reconciliation.--The new master, James\r\n    Nichols.--\"Spare the rod and spoil the child.\"--The age of\r\n    chivalry not gone.--Magnanimity of a school-boy.--Friendship\r\n    between Willard and Henry Abbott.--Good-bye to the \"little\r\n    deacon.\"\r\n\r\nWillard Glazier was, by no means, what is termed a bad boy, at school.\r\n\r\nIt is true he was full of mischief; was the last in for study and the\r\nfirst out for recreation, but he was neither disobedient nor inattentive\r\nto his lessons. One scholarly element, however, he lacked. The bump\r\nwhich phrenologists term reverence had small development in him at this\r\nperiod of his existence. His record always stood high in the matter of\r\nlessons, but low in the matter of conduct. Instances of insubordination\r\noccurred whenever he thought he was treated unfairly, while no boy was\r\never more ready to submit to authority when wisely and justly\r\nadministered. The following incident is an illustration in point:\r\n\r\nOne of his teachers bore the name of Cornelius Carter. We have been\r\nunable to ascertain this gentleman's nationality, nor would his history,\r\nif known to us, be pertinent to this work, but we have reason to\r\nbelieve that he was of Scottish descent, if not actually a native of\r\nthat\r\n\r\n    \"Land of brown heath and shaggy wood,\r\n    Land of the mountain and the flood.\"\r\n\r\nAt all events he possessed all the sterling qualities of that\r\nclear-headed people.\r\n\r\nA man of fine parts and scholarly attainments, earnestly bent upon doing\r\nhis whole duty, vigorous, energetic and thorough in everything, Carter\r\nwas just the man to conduct a school with mathematical precision, but at\r\nthe same time, his natural irritability was such that the whirlwind was\r\nless fierce than his wrath, when the latter was aroused. About the time\r\nof his advent among the pupils at the Little York public school,\r\ngum-chewing had become an accomplishment among the boys, and though it\r\nwas a species of amusement positively forbidden, was carried on\r\nsurreptitiously throughout the school.\r\n\r\nOne dark winter morning just after a heavy fall of snow, it happened\r\nthat our friend Willard, though placed upon a bench in the middle of a\r\nrow of these gum-chewing juveniles, was himself not chewing, for the\r\nsimple reason that he had no gum to chew, and his next neighbors were\r\nniggardly enough to refuse to give him any.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the hawk eye of Carter swept down upon the offending group; and\r\nquite assured that if mischief was in progress, young Glazier was in it,\r\ncame forward and stretching out his long arms, placed his palms upon the\r\noutermost cheek of each \"end boy,\" and brought the heads of the entire\r\nline together with a shock that made them ring again. Then, without a\r\nword, he caught each urchin in turn by the collar of his coat, and with\r\none vigorous jerk swung him into the middle of the floor and in his\r\nsternest tones bade him stand there until further orders.\r\n\r\nWillard did not at the moment venture to say anything, but stood with\r\nthe rest, nursing his wrath. Had he really been at fault he would have\r\nthought nothing of it, but first to have been deprived by circumstances\r\nof the opportunity to break the rules, and then to be punished for a\r\nbreach of them, was too much.\r\n\r\nHe waited, without a word, until the group of delinquents, after\r\nlistening to a scathing lecture, were dismissed to their seats. He then\r\ndeliberately proceeded to put his books under his arm, preparatory to\r\nmaking a start for home.\r\n\r\nOne of the monitors, a large boy, observing this movement, informed Mr.\r\nCarter that Willard Glazier was going to \"cut for home,\" in other words,\r\nto leave school without permission.\r\n\r\nThe master, upon receiving this intelligence, started down the aisle\r\ntowards young Willard; but that restive youth perceiving the movement,\r\nmade rapid time for the door, and dashed down-stairs closely pursued by\r\nthe now furious pedagogue.\r\n\r\nHaving some rods the advantage at the start, the boy reached the\r\nexterior of the building first, and struck out in a straight line for\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Race With The Schoolmaster.]\r\n\r\nThe storms which prevailed throughout the entire winter in St. Lawrence\r\nCounty, had piled up their accumulated snows over the space of ground\r\nthat separated the school-house from Willard Glazier's home. Over this\r\nsingle expanse of deep snow many feet had trodden a hard path, which\r\nalternate melting and freezing had formed into a solid, slippery,\r\nback-bone looking ridge, altogether unsafe for fast travel. Over this\r\nridge young Willard was now running at the top of his speed. In view of\r\nthe probable flogging behind, he took no heed of the perils of the path\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\n    \"So like an arrow, swift he flew\r\n      Shot by an archer strong,\r\n    So did he fly, which brings me to\r\n      The middle of my song.\"\r\n\r\nAs for Carter, not a whit daunted by the icy path and the fact that he\r\nwas hatless, in slippers, and clad only in a long, loose summer coat\r\nworn in the heated school-room, he gave chase in gallant style, and\r\nwhile Willard possessed the advantage of an earlier start, the teacher's\r\nlong legs compensated for the time gained by his pupil, and made a\r\npretty even race of it.\r\n\r\nOn he went therefore, his coat-tails standing out straight like the\r\nforks of a boot-jack, and a red bandanna handkerchief streaming in the\r\nwind from his pocket behind like some fierce piratic flag! On, too, went\r\nMaster Willard Glazier, until both--one now nearly upon the heels of the\r\nother--reached a troublesome miniature glacier, when each missed his\r\nfooting.\r\n\r\nDown went the boy's head and up went the master's heels, and the pair\r\nlay together, panting for breath, in the drifts of a contiguous\r\nsnow-bank.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, ha!\" said Carter, when he had recovered sufficiently to speak, \"so\r\nyou were going home, were you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said young Willard, as his head emerged from the drift, looking\r\nlike an animated snow-ball, \"and I would have reached there, too, if I\r\nhadn't slipped.\"\r\n\r\nThis was all that was said, at the time, but as Mr. Carter led his\r\nprisoner back, an explanation took place, in which the lad so strongly\r\ninsisted that his escapade arose from a sense of the gross injustice\r\ndone him, that Carter's own sense of right was touched, and after\r\nadmonishing the boy to take a different mode of redressing his\r\ngrievances in the future, he agreed to forego the flogging and let\r\nMaster Willard finish the remainder of the session in the customary way.\r\n\r\nAfter this occurrence, Willard got along very well under the tuition of\r\nMr. Carter, and it was not until some years later, when a gentleman by\r\nthe name of Nichols took charge of the school, that anything transpired\r\nworthy of note.\r\n\r\nJames Nichols was a devout believer in Solomon's maxim that to spare the\r\nrod is to spoil the child. The whip was his arbiter in all differences\r\nwhich arose between his pupils and himself. He never paused, as Mr.\r\nMontieth has lately done, to consider that at least two-thirds of the\r\noffences for which children are flogged at school are \"crimes for which\r\nthey are in nowise responsible,\" and \"when stripped of the color given\r\nto them by senseless and unmeaning rules, they are simply the crimes of\r\nbeing a boy and being a girl,\" and are \"incited by bad air, cold feet,\r\noverwork and long confinement; crimes which the parents of these same\r\nchildren are accustomed to excuse in themselves, when they sit in\r\nchurch, by the dulness of the sermon, or other circumstances that offend\r\nagainst nature and which they sometimes soothe with fennel or hartshorn,\r\nor change of position, and not unseldom with sleep.\" In school\r\ndiscipline Mr. Nichols was a pure materialist. He never realized\r\nCayley's profound lesson that \"education is not the mere storing a\r\nyouthful memory with a bundle of facts which it neither digests nor\r\nassimilates,\" but that it is the formation and training of a mind. Under\r\nhis _regime_ the rod ruled everything. Even the offence of whispering\r\nwas punished by the lash.\r\n\r\nUpon one occasion, when young Willard was seated between two\r\nbrothers--Henry and Brayton Abbott by name--engaged in solving Algebraic\r\nproblems, a whispered inquiry, regarding the lesson, passed from one to\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nMr. Nichols at the moment happened to glance towards them, and\r\nconjectured, by the movement of Willard's lips, that he was violating\r\nthe rule against whispering.\r\n\r\n\"Willard Glazier!\" said he, angrily, \"come out here, sir!\"\r\n\r\nThe boy obeyed.\r\n\r\n\"Now then, Willard,\" said Mr. Nichols, \"I presume you understand the\r\nrules of this school?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I do, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then you know that whispering during the hours of study is a\r\nbreach of its discipline, and that I must punish you.\"\r\n\r\nWillard said nothing.\r\n\r\n\"Have you a knife, sir?\" pursued the teacher.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir,\" replied the boy, not quite certain whether the knife was\r\nwanted for the purpose of scalping him, or merely with a view of\r\namputating the unruly member which had been the instrument of offence.\r\n\"Well, take this one,\" said Nichols, handing him a five-bladed\r\npocket-knife, with the large blade open, \"go out and cut me a good stout\r\nstick.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy by no means relished the prospect this mission suggested, but\r\nseeing no means of escape, he went to a grove in the neighborhood and\r\ncut a stick whose dimensions resembled a young tree--shrewdly suspecting\r\nthat Nichols would never venture to use a club of such size.\r\n\r\nWith this stick he stalked majestically back to the school-room. As he\r\nentered, he saw Henry Abbott standing up in front of the teacher's desk,\r\nand heard him utter these words:\r\n\r\n\"It is not fair, Mr. Nichols, to flog Willard alone. It was my fault,\r\nsir. I beckoned to Brayton and whispered first. That is what started it.\r\nYou should whip me, too, sir.\"\r\n\r\nThe master, as we have said, was stern and uncompromising, but his\r\nnature was not entirely devoid of feeling, and as he heard the brave\r\nadmission, his eye lighted up with sudden softness.\r\n\r\n\"Go back to your seats, boys,\" said he, \"I will not flog either of you\r\nto-day. Lads that are brave enough to face the punishment of one offence\r\nas you have done, can, I hope, be trusted not to soon commit another.\"\r\n\r\nThe incident was one that raised the tone of the whole school, and it\r\ngave rise to a warm feeling of admiration in Willard Glazier's breast\r\nfor Henry Abbott which did Willard good, and made the two youths firm\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nThus the years sped on--dotted with little incidents that seem too\r\ntrivial to relate, and yet each one of which had _some_ effect upon the\r\nfuture life and character of young Willard. He had become a pretty wild\r\nboy by this time, and the cognomen of the \"little deacon\" was dropped\r\nwithout ceremony.\r\n\r\nAlthough he was marked high for scholarly attainment, he received many a\r\nbad mark for violating the rules of school.\r\n\r\nThis state of affairs existed until the boy had reached the age of\r\neleven years, when he was brought into contact with two diametrically\r\nopposite influences, one of which was calculated to _make_ and the other\r\nto mar his future character and fortunes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nECCENTRICITIES OF HENRY GLAZIER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Henry Glazier.--A singular character.--\"Kaw-shaw-gan-ce\" and\r\n    \"Quaw-taw-pee-ah.\"--Tom Lolar and Henry Glazier.--Attractive\r\n    show-bills.--Billy Muldoon and his trombone.--Behind the\r\n    scenes.--\"Sound your G!\"--The mysterious musician.--What happened\r\n    to Billy.--\"May the divil fly away wid ye!\"\r\n\r\nAt this time there resided in the paternal homestead a younger brother\r\nof Ward Glazier named Henry, who was Willard's senior by about eleven\r\nyears, and, physically speaking, was a splendid specimen of masculine\r\ndevelopment. Like his brothers Ward and George, he stood six feet in his\r\nstockings, and literally looked down on his fellows.\r\n\r\nHe had conceived a great liking for his nephew Willard, and on many a\r\nhunting excursion in the Great North Woods, the boy was his only\r\ncompanion. This affection, however, was not unmingled with some contempt\r\nfor the lad's diminutive stature.\r\n\r\nUpon one occasion, during a visit to West Boylston, he made it his\r\nbusiness to search out the relatives of Willard's mother, in order to\r\nascertain what sort of stock she came from. On returning home, this son\r\nof Anak exclaimed, with a dejected air:\r\n\r\n\"Mother, I'll be hanged if I ain't discouraged! Our Willard will always\r\nbe a little runt. His mother's folks ain't bigger'n a pinch of snuff!\"\r\n\r\nHow far the prediction has been verified any one who has seen the\r\ncompact, sinewy form of the young soldier will understand.\r\n\r\nHenry Glazier reveled in everything sensational. His ideal of heaven was\r\na succession of tableaux in which he was to play the principal part.\r\n\r\nAt one time he joined another eccentric character named Tom Lolar, an\r\nIndian of the Seneca tribe, whose lands in the long ago of Indian\r\nhistory bordered the blue waters of Lake Seneca in central New York.\r\nThis peculiar pair proceeded to electrify certain rural communities in\r\ntheir immediate neighborhood with huge posters, announcing that on a\r\ngiven night:\r\n\r\n                     KAW-SHAW-GAN-CE,\r\n\r\n                           OR\r\n\r\n                     THE RED WILD CAT,\r\n\r\n                          THE\r\n\r\n        _Great Chief of the Walaitipu Indians,_\r\n\r\n  Now traveling for the benefit of his tribe, proposes to exhibit\r\n                to an enlightened public the\r\n\r\n              Trophies won by his Braves,\r\n\r\n    In their battles with other Ferocious Tribes beyond the Rocky\r\n        Mountains, and the Great Chief will likewise give an\r\n                     exhibition of the\r\n\r\n                 WAR DANCES OF HIS NATION.\r\n\r\nAccordingly upon the night in question Tom Lolar as \"_Kaw-shaw-gan-ce_,\"\r\nand Henry Glazier as ticket agent, reaped such an excellent harvest that\r\nthe latter concluded to start a \"live Indian\" upon his own account.\r\n\r\nThis he accordingly did, dubbing the prodigy of his creation\r\n\"Quaw-taw-pee-ah,\" or the \"Red Wild Cat.\"\r\n\r\nWhether this venture was successful or not we have failed to learn, but\r\nthere is one story connected with it which is too good to be lost,\r\nthough it lacks satisfactory evidence of authenticity.\r\n\r\nThe legend runs that our enterprising manager went three miles away and\r\nhunted up a genuine old native of Erin who had deserted from the British\r\narmy, where he held some position in one of the military bands attached\r\nto a regiment stationed in Canada. With true Irish instinct this exile\r\nof Erin had brought his trombone across the border, and \"the\r\nenterprising manager\"--to use the language of the bills--\"secured in him\r\nthe services of an eminent musician, late of Her Majesty's Royal Band,\"\r\nto discourse sweet music during the entire performance. This and other\r\nattractive announcements drew a goodly crowd of lads and lasses from far\r\nand near to the place appointed, and when the doors--otherwise\r\ntent-flaps--were open, the assemblage marched in to the entrancing\r\nstrains of the trombone, as played by \"Professor Muldoonati\" _alias_\r\nBilly Muldoon.\r\n\r\nEverything passed off well. \"Quaw-taw-pee-ah\" presented to the _elite_\r\nof the locality a type of the aboriginal American, which at least\r\npossessed the merit of originality. If the audience expected to be\r\nastonished they were not disappointed; for such an Indian as they then\r\nbeheld no living eye had ever looked upon before.\r\n\r\nMr. Catlin would have admitted that this noble red man was alien to any\r\nof his tribes, and even Cooper's Leather-Stocking would have conceded\r\nthat his was a new revelation of savage humanity. It is barely possible\r\nthat Buffalo Bill may have dreamed of something like him, and it is not\r\nimpossible that the late Edwin Forrest may have actually been on\r\nspeaking terms with his brother, but outside of these two gentlemen, we\r\ndo not believe that human imagination ever conceived a child of the\r\nforest in any respect resembling \"Quaw-taw-pee-ah\" on his opening night.\r\n\r\nIt did seem a little singular to combine the convivial music of \"St.\r\nPatrick's day in the morning\" with such diabolical grimaces and gestures\r\nas those which the Great Chief used in the pantomimic expression of his\r\nsentiments. But the people were prepared for originality, and they had\r\nit. At any rate the performance received their loud applause. At last,\r\nhowever, it was over: the successive scenes of the programme had come\r\nand gone--the war dances were finished, the curtain had fallen on the\r\nlast act, and Billy Muldoon's trombone had subsided into silence. But if\r\nthe performance within was wild, it was nothing to the wild night\r\nwithout. It was the seventeenth of March, and the snow had been steadily\r\nfalling since morning, shrouding the hills and all the surrounding\r\ncountry with a mantle as white and cold as a winding sheet.\r\n\r\nThe wind had increased since nightfall, and by the time\r\n\"Quaw-taw-pee-ah\" had washed his face of its red lead, and Mr. Muldoon\r\nhad been paid his share of the proceeds, it was blowing \"great guns,\" as\r\nthe sailors say. Out into such a night as this the audience dispersed:\r\nbut the lights of home shone through the blinding storm near at hand,\r\nand buffeting with the fierce gusts of whirling snow and wind was only\r\nbrave sport for them. Not so, however, with Mr. Billy Muldoon. _His_\r\nhome was three miles away, and though the prospect without was anything\r\nbut pleasant, he prepared to face it like a man. His only precaution was\r\nto see that an old army canteen was filled afresh with the best whiskey\r\nthe neighborhood afforded. Then he started on his homeward journey.\r\n\r\nAt first it was pretty hard work. The snow had drifted into heaps in\r\nsome places, and rose almost to the little man's waist. Still he\r\nstruggled bravely on, only stopping now and then to celebrate the\r\nanniversary of Ireland's Patron Saint by taking a long pull and a strong\r\npull at the canteen.\r\n\r\nFor a half-hour or more he made but slow progress through the pitiless,\r\npelting storm, and he heartily cursed his folly in attempting the task\r\nof coming home at all, on such a night as this. But a change came o'er\r\nthe spirit of his dream. As the contents of the canteen had diminished,\r\nBilly's spirits had risen in exact proportion, his heart had grown\r\nstrong and he began to despise the difficulties in his way. In fact he\r\nwas as happy as a prince, and rather liked the idea of facing the snow\r\ndrifts and fighting the wind. So on he went. What seemed strange to\r\nBilly was the fact that there seemed to be so much sameness in the\r\nsurrounding features of the landscape--or so much of it as he could\r\ndiscover, during the momentary lulls of the storm. He therefore stopped\r\nshort, steadied himself for a moment, and took another drink; which\r\nproceeding seemed to clear up his mind on the puzzled subject, for\r\nmuttering that it was \"all roight,\" he once more started forward.\r\n\r\nAnother half-hour passed and still another, and yet Billy found the road\r\nopen before him, with no sign of his own humble little home. He began to\r\ngrow very tired and considerably muddled, and paused at length to\r\nconsider the situation.\r\n\r\nIn front of him he perceived something so like the lane that led to his\r\nown shanty that he joyfully proceeded, and at length reached what he\r\nbelieved to be a back door that he had directed his wife to leave \"on\r\nthe latch\" for his return.\r\n\r\nWhat surprised him was that he could see no light within. He was,\r\nhowever, sufficiently aware of the fact that he had taken more of \"the\r\ncrayther\" than his good woman would approve of, so not caring to wake\r\nher up, he stole to the door and tried to lift the latch. It was\r\nfastened. Everything within was dark as Erebus, and not a sound could be\r\nheard except the low breathing of what he supposed to be his sleeping\r\nchildren. This rather excited Billy's wrath. He had been particular in\r\nhis injunction to leave the door unbolted, and it was hard to be kept\r\nout in the storm on such a night as this. He called out--at first in a\r\nwhisper, then louder and louder--to Kathleen to let him in. There was no\r\nresponse. Yet he certainly heard the movement of feet within. What could\r\nit mean? The little man finally swore a big oath and fiercely demanded\r\nadmittance; but still there came no reply. He then essayed to force the\r\ndoor, and to his utter amazement the upper part of it gave way, opening\r\nout like a window-shutter, while the lower part remained firm. The\r\nmusician therefore climbed up, and seating himself on the edge of the\r\ndoor, peered in. He could see nothing but a black void. To use his own\r\nfigure of speech, \"yez might as well hunt for Gineral Washington's will\r\ndown a black dog's throat, as attimpt to see the nose on yer face in\r\nthere!\"\r\n\r\nHe was nearly paralyzed with astonishment. Suddenly a bright thought\r\nstruck him. He raised his trombone to his lips, and in spite of the\r\nmingled emotions that agitated his breast, blew upon it a blast loud\r\nenough to have waked the dead.\r\n\r\nImagine therefore how his previous astonishment was deepened into almost\r\nidiotic wonder when he heard a reply from what appeared to be a trombone\r\nof more gigantic power than his own. \"Bur-r-r!\" went Mr. Muldoon's\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\n\"Boo-o-o!\" replied the invisible respondent.\r\n\r\nBilly was amazed. Billy was awe-stricken. But the instinct of the\r\nmusician rose above all other emotions.\r\n\r\n\"Sound your G!\" said Billy.\r\n\r\n\"Boo-o-o!\" was the answer in a deeper base than before.\r\n\r\n\"Yer out o' tune, ye domned old fool!\" says Billy.\r\n\r\n\"Boo-o-o!\" came the response once more.\r\n\r\n\"Sound yer G, and take that, ye murtherin spalpeen!\" said the now\r\nthoroughly exasperated musician, dashing his own instrument in the\r\ndirection of his invisible rival.\r\n\r\nJust then poor Billy saw a ferocious-looking pair of eyes glaring at\r\nhim, and before he had time to add another word, some huge object rushed\r\ntowards him, struck him a determined blow, and lifting him off his perch\r\nsent him into the middle of the road.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, Billy had wandered very much out of his way, and had\r\nmistaken Ward Glazier's barn for his own dwelling. The supposed rival\r\nmusician was our old acquaintance, \"Black-face,\" the Bull.\r\n\r\nBilly picked himself up from the snow, and, regardless of his bruised\r\nbody and aching bones, steadied himself for a last shot at the enemy.\r\nThe little man looked in the direction where he thought his adversary\r\nought to be, and though he could see nothing through the darkness and\r\nstorm, he shouted out, in accents of blended dignity and contempt:\r\n\r\n\"May the divil fly away wid ye! Ye may be the sthronger of the two, but,\r\nbe jabers, yer no museecian!\"\r\n\r\nHow he eventually got home and what were his sentiments regarding the\r\nadventure with which he had met, are facts that do not concern this\r\nhistory; but it is quite probable that he wondered as we have often\r\ndone, that St. Patrick, while engaged in the laudable task of expelling\r\nsnakes from the soil of the Emerald Isle, did not also provide that such\r\nreptiles should keep out of the boots of her sons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nVISIONS OF THE FUTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The big uncle and the little nephew.--Exchange of ideas between the\r\n    eccentric Henry Glazier and young Willard.--Inseparable\r\n    companions.--Willard's early reading.--Favorite\r\n    authors.--Hero-worship of the first Napoleon and Charles XII. of\r\n    Sweden.--The genius of good and of evil.--Allen Wight.--A born\r\n    teacher.--Reverses of fortune.--The shadow on the\r\n    home.--Willard's resolve to seek his fortune and what came of\r\n    it.--The sleep under the trees.--The prodigal's return.--\"All's\r\n    well that ends well.\"\r\n\r\nBetween Henry Glazier and young Willard a singular friendship had sprung\r\nup. The great, six-foot uncle and the quaint, old-fashioned boy were\r\nmuch together.\r\n\r\nIn the woods and fields, at junketings and corn-huskings, the pair were\r\noften seen in grave converse, and while Willard was ever eager to hear\r\nthe stories of his uncle's mad adventures and queer scrapes, Henry\r\nGlazier, in turn, would listen with a species of reverent wonder to the\r\nboy's recital of striking passages of history or of fiction which he had\r\npicked up in the course of a varied and desultory reading--a taste for\r\nwhich was developed even at that early age. The volumes to which he had\r\naccess were few in number, but he had read their pages again and again,\r\nand the subjects of which they treated were, for the most part, of just\r\nsuch a character as were calculated to attract the attention of a youth\r\nof action rather than of thought.\r\n\r\nAmong them were \"Rollin's Ancient History,\" \"Robinson Crusoe,\" \"The\r\nArabian Nights,\" \"Life of Charles XII. of Sweden,\" \"Kossuth and his\r\nGenerals,\" and \"Napoleon and his Marshals,\"--everything relating to the\r\ncareer of the great Corsican being devoured with the greatest avidity.\r\n\r\nHe began, of course, by reading the descriptions of battles. All boys do\r\nso. But gradually his interest in such exciting events extended to the\r\nactors in them, and again to the causes that led to them, and at length\r\nthe books were read from the preface to the end.\r\n\r\nThe conversations between the uncle and nephew were far from exercising\r\na good influence over the boy. If Willard related some daring deed from\r\nthe life of Charles XII. or of the great Napoleon--his own especial\r\nhero--his uncle Henry would match it with some equally striking, if less\r\ncivilized adventure in the forest or upon the river, in which he or some\r\nof his whilom associates had played the principal part. All this was, to\r\na certain extent, calculated to unsettle the lad's mind for the common,\r\nroutine duties of a useful existence. Fortunately, however, at about the\r\ntime that it began to produce that effect, another opposite and more\r\npowerful influence was brought to bear upon him which changed the\r\ncurrent of his ambition, and turned his attention to matters less\r\nexciting in their character, but destined to exert a much greater\r\ninfluence over his future life. I allude to his association with his\r\nteacher, Allen Wight.\r\n\r\nThe small, plain brick school-house at Little York stands there, we\r\nbelieve, to-day as it did then in all its native and naked ugliness.\r\nSuch a structure, looking at it aesthetically, is not a cheerful sight\r\nto the lover of learning, but at that period it was under the mastership\r\nof a mind of no ordinary calibre. From all that we can learn of him,\r\nAllen Wight was that remarkable character--a born educator. He did not\r\nbelieve his duty was performed by merely drilling his pupils,\r\nparrot-like, to repeat other men's sentiments. He knew that the minds of\r\nmortals, particularly if young and fresh, are as diverse in their\r\nsprings of action as the laws of the universe, and he conceived it to be\r\nhis duty to study the individual characteristics of each scholar under\r\nhis charge, as he would have familiarized himself with the notes of a\r\npiece of music before he attempted to play it. His method was that of\r\nthe Jesuit, carried out in a Protestant fashion. In young Glazier he\r\ntook especial interest. He liked the sturdy little fellow who, though\r\nfull of youthful vim, could yet sit down and discuss the difference\r\nbetween a Macedonian phalanx as described by Rollin and a _corps\r\nd'armee_ as manoeuvred by Soult, and he determined if possible--to use\r\nhis own phraseology--\"to make a man of him.\"\r\n\r\nHis first step was to lead the boy's mind up to a habit of reasoning\r\nupon the present and the past, and upon the every day world of practical\r\nrealities with which he had to do. When this habit had become\r\nsufficiently matured in him, the wise teacher told him the story of his\r\nown life, with its struggles, its disappointments and its triumphs,\r\nthinking thus to stimulate his favorite pupil to greater efforts and\r\nbetter achievements in the path of knowledge. He talked to young Willard\r\nas he would have talked to a man, yet with all the gentleness of manner\r\nhe would have used in addressing a woman. Every incentive which he could\r\nplace before the boy, every appeal to both heart and brain which he\r\ncould make, Allen Wight used--as the mechanic would use the lever--to\r\nbring out all that was noblest and best in him--to develop all the\r\nsleeping possibilities of his young nature.\r\n\r\nWard Glazier had not been as prosperous in his worldly affairs as his\r\npatriotism and honesty deserved, and things at the old \"Homestead\"\r\nlooked rather gloomy. Poverty is a fearful darkener of child-life, and\r\nwhile its shadow rarely fell on Willard, who was always at school or\r\nroving the woods and fields with his uncle Henry, to his sisters and\r\nbrothers it frequently presented its dark face and whispered unpleasant\r\nprophesies of the future.\r\n\r\nOf course it was not that abject kind of poverty which stints the supply\r\nof food and fire in a house. It did not still the prattle of the\r\nchildren, or banish childish mirth from the dwelling. It was not the\r\nwolf at the door, but the wolf in the dim possible distance when the\r\npoor father, bent with age, would perhaps be unable to keep his little\r\nflock together. But the boy had never thought of such a possible time.\r\n_His_ visions of the future were of sights to be seen in the great\r\nworld--of a time when he would be large enough and free enough to\r\naccompany his uncle Henry upon some of his wild adventures among\r\ncivilized or savage races, and of the delights of unlimited books to be\r\nread upon subjects most congenial to his mind. He therefore made no\r\nallowance for his father's gloomy face and short words, and often\r\nthought him stern when he was only sad.\r\n\r\nA slight incident, however, changed all this and compelled him to face\r\nlife not as a dream but as a reality. One evening Willard's father came\r\nhome very tired and somewhat dispirited by some adverse circumstances,\r\nsuch as occur in every man's business life at times, and of course he\r\nwas not in the most pleasant frame of mind to encounter the petty\r\nannoyances of a household. Something that Willard said or did, capped\r\nthe climax of his irritability and he called the boy a fool. It was a\r\nvery unusual thing for Ward Glazier to speak with even apparent\r\nharshness to his children, and the lad felt it, therefore, all the more\r\nkeenly. He became very thoughtful and silent, and crept off to bed\r\nearlier than usual only to lie awake most of the night brooding over the\r\ninsult, and debating within himself what to do in order to vindicate his\r\noutraged dignity. The conclusion at which he finally arrived was that\r\nwhen the morning came, he would run away from home and seek his fortune\r\nin the great world. The fact is he had been reading \"Robinson Crusoe\"\r\nbut a day or two previous, and that charming story had made a great\r\nimpression on his mind. Under its weird influence his vivid imagination\r\nconjured up possible scenes of adventure in which he was to emulate the\r\ncourage and sagacity of that celebrated truant, and eventually come\r\nhome, as Robinson did, a man full of knowledge with which to astonish\r\nthe family, and with wealth to lavish on brothers and sisters, and make\r\ncomfortable the declining years of his parents. \"_Then_ his father would\r\nnot think him a fool,\" said this youthful logician to himself. His\r\nactive little brain was too highly stimulated by his great resolve to\r\npermit much sleep that night, and his bosom swelled proudly as he\r\nthought how bravely he would encounter misfortune and face danger for\r\nthe sake of the glorious future he saw in the distance. His boyish heart\r\nthrilled strangely within him as he pictured to himself how full of\r\namazement his brothers and sisters would be, when they found he had gone\r\nforth all alone to seek his fortune. Even the little sleep, therefore,\r\nthat he obtained, was but a dreamy repetition of his waking thoughts,\r\nand when the first gray streak of dawn told of the coming day, the boy\r\narose and quietly dressing himself for his journey, emerged from the\r\nhouse, passed down the avenue under the broad elms and struck the\r\nhighway. He shivered a little as the chill air of morning touched his\r\ncheek, and his ambitious dream did not look quite so glowing and\r\nglorious as it had done when snugly ensconced in his comfortable bed,\r\nbut still he had a consciousness that he was doing something very manly,\r\nand he walked on with a firm step and determined heart.\r\n\r\nIt is true he had no very definite idea of _where_ he was going,--he\r\nonly thought of doing great things and seeing strange sights. His whole\r\nplan of travel was comprehended in the one idea of _going out into the\r\nworld_. That was all. Accordingly the youth trudged on for miles without\r\nweariness,--for his head was still thronged with thick coming fancies of\r\nthe possible future that lay before him, and for some time the exulting\r\nsense of freedom that ever accompanies disenthralment of any kind,\r\nthrilled his whole being with a firm resolution to accomplish great\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nAt the expiration of a few hours, however, the fatigue involved in so\r\nunusual a tramp before breakfast, began to tell upon him, and as he\r\nmechanically slackened his pace, his reflections assumed a less jubilant\r\nand less satisfactory character. He had walked nearly fourteen miles and\r\nwas already footsore. \"Going out into the world,\" began to seem not\r\nquite so enchanting a proceeding as it had appeared to be at starting.\r\nFor the first time since the idea of \"seeking his fortune\" had entered\r\nhis mind, he asked himself _where_ he was to seek it.\r\n\r\nThe reply to this inquiry was not easy. Meanwhile the sun had mounted\r\nhigh up in the heavens and was shining brightly, the birds were singing\r\ntheir matin songs, and in the roadside pastures the cattle were quietly\r\ngrazing. It was a peaceful, pastoral scene, but its peace did not enter\r\nthe heart of the wanderer. Somehow the world did not appear half so\r\nattractive in his eyes as it had looked when he stole forth from his\r\nfather's gate in the cold gray of the morning twilight. His step,\r\ntherefore, was less elastic and his bearing less assured now than then,\r\nand at length he sat down under a large beech-tree by the roadside, to\r\nreflect upon the situation. He began to feel very weary, and the sudden\r\ntransition from action to repose induced a drowsiness that in a few\r\nminutes overcame his waking sense and launched him into the sea of\r\nforgetfulness. The young head sank lower and lower on his breast, and\r\nfinally, sleep ... \"that knits up the ravelled sleeve of care,\"...\r\n\"sore labor's bath, balm of hurt minds, great Nature's second course,\"\r\ncame to him unawares, and for some hours he was totally oblivious of all\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\nIt was a dreamless sleep, and noon had come when he awoke. For a few\r\nmoments he was unable to recall where he was or how he had come there,\r\nbut in a very short time the recollection of everything that had\r\nhappened to him since the evening before swept over his mind like a\r\nflood. Every circumstance now, however, was viewed in a far different\r\nlight. Somehow, the provocation which had sent him into the wide world\r\nto seek his fortune did not seem half so great as it had seemed only the\r\nnight before. The example of De Foe's hero was not so completely\r\nalluring, and a portion of that history which the evening previous he\r\nhad not deemed worthy of a thought, now rose vividly before him. He\r\nseemed to read again these words:\r\n\r\n\"My father, a grave, wise man, gave me serious and excellent counsel\r\nagainst what he saw was my design. He told me it was for men of\r\ndesperate fortunes on the one hand, or of aspiring superior fortunes on\r\nthe other, who went abroad upon adventures, to rise by enterprise and\r\nmake themselves famous in undertakings of a nature out of the common\r\nroad: that these things were all either too far above me, or too far\r\nbelow me: that mine was the middle state or what might be called the\r\nupper station of humble life, which he had found by long experience was\r\nthe best state in the world, the most suited to human happiness. The\r\nwise man gave his testimony to this when he prayed to have 'neither\r\npoverty nor riches.'\" And then came the thought that all that Robinson\r\never gained in fame or fortune, failed to still the quiet but terrible\r\nwhisper of his conscience whenever he thought of those he had abandoned\r\nfor a roving life. So intently did he think upon these things, he seemed\r\nactually to behold the wanderer upon his sea-girt island with lawless\r\nWill Atkins and the gentle French priest beside him, while the words of\r\nthe repentant mutineer seemed to be hissed into his ear:--\"No, sir, I\r\ndid not cut his throat, but I cut the throat of all his comforts. I\r\nshortened his days and I broke his heart by the most ungrateful,\r\nunnatural return, for the most tender and affectionate treatment that\r\nfather ever gave or child could receive.\" Young Willard could not but\r\nremember that _his_ parents had been most kind and tender, that _his_\r\nfather had lavished upon him during all the years of his childhood a\r\nmost prodigal wealth of affection: and the one harsh epithet he had\r\nreceived seemed as nothing among the multitude of kind and loving words\r\nthat had never been withheld from him. His heart told him that something\r\ndeeper than any ordinary woe would darken his mother's quiet face when\r\nshe beheld his empty chair and realized that he had gone, perhaps never\r\nto return, without one farewell word to her. Such reflections as these,\r\nthat he wondered had not occurred to him before, now took possession of\r\nhis mind and, impelled by their influence, he arose and slowly started\r\nback towards home. As he came within sight of the old place he saw his\r\nfather in the distance reaping, and the sight filled him with gladness.\r\n\r\n    \"From the top of the road, through the gap was seen\r\n       Down a zigzag road cut up by rills,\r\n    The velvet valley cradled between\r\n       Dark double ridges of 'elm' clad hills;\r\n    And just beyond, on the sunniest slope,\r\n       With its windows aglint in the sunset warm,\r\n    In the spot where he first knew life and hope,\r\n       Was the dear old house of the 'Homestead' farm.\"\r\n\r\nBut he was not just then in a frame of mind to meet the parental eye,\r\nand he therefore skirted round a piece of woods which concealed him from\r\nhis father's view and reaching the door unobserved, crept into the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nThough his absence had been discovered, and its cause, if not known, at\r\nleast shrewdly suspected, his father and mother in their reception of\r\nhim very wisely ignored all knowledge of his truancy and treated the\r\nyoung prodigal with such unusual marks of kindness and indulgence, that\r\nhe was completely melted, and felt, with keen remorse, that he had been\r\nupon the eve of becoming a most wretched ingrate. The lesson of the\r\nexperiment was not lost upon him, and he never again tried the foolish\r\nventure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLARD GLAZIER AT HOME.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Out of boyhood.--Days of adolescence.--True family pride.--Schemes\r\n    for the future.--Willard as a temperance advocate.--Watering his\r\n    grandfather's whiskey.--The pump behind the hill. The sleigh-ride\r\n    by night.--The \"shakedown\" at Edwards.--Intoxicated by tobacco\r\n    fumes.--The return ride.--Landed in a snow-bank.--Good-bye horses\r\n    and sleigh!--Plodding through the snow.\r\n\r\nWard Glazier--putting his theories to the test of practice--believed it\r\nbest to allow the error of his son to work out its own punishment,\r\nwithout adding a word to indicate that he knew it had been committed.\r\nThe wisdom of such reticence is not often recognized by parents placed\r\nin similar circumstances, but it would perhaps be better for the\r\nchildren if it were. At the same time the father thought it expedient to\r\napprise Allen Wight of the matter. That gentleman readily acquiescing in\r\nhis plans, saw in the recoil which would probably succeed such an\r\nescapade in the mind of a sensitive and generous boy, the opportunity he\r\nsought to arouse him to a sense of the duties that lay before him in his\r\nfuture career, in living a useful and worthy life.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, therefore, when they were enjoying a quiet chat after\r\nschool hours, he managed--without the slightest allusion to the runaway\r\nfreak--to turn the conversation to the subject of \"self-made men.\" Not,\r\nbe it understood, that species of fungi who only love their maker,\r\nbecause being\r\n\r\n    \"_Self_-made, _self_-trained, _self_-satisfied,\"\r\n\r\nthey are\r\n\r\n    \"Themselves their only daily boast and pride.\"\r\n\r\nNot the Randall Leslies, or the Peter Firkins of the world or that other\r\n\r\n                \"Score of Peter Funks,\r\n    Of the mock-mining stamp, who deal in chunks\r\n    Of confidence, ores and metals as examples\r\n    And sell the bowels of the earth by samples;\"\r\n\r\nbut that higher race who have achieved noble things despite all the\r\ndrawbacks of poverty and friendlessness.\r\n\r\nHe spoke of Clive, the Shropshire farmer's son, who, according to the\r\ngreatest of modern historians, equalled Lucullus in war and Tergot in\r\npeace; that reformer who out of the discordant elements of an Indian\r\noligarchy consolidated and perfected an empire, one of the most splendid\r\nthe world contains.\r\n\r\nHe spoke, too, of that other Indian ruler who as he lay dreaming a boy's\r\nday-dream one holiday, upon the bank of a stream that flowed through\r\nDaylesford Manor--the manor which one ancestor's sword had won and\r\nanother ancestor's folly had lost--who formed a scheme of life that\r\nculminated in the extension of the same empire beyond all previous\r\nexpectation, and in linking his own name so inseparably with the story\r\nof his country, that no man can write the history of England without\r\nwriting the life of Warren Hastings.\r\n\r\nOther examples of great ends achieved with little means, by men in our\r\nown land, were talked over.\r\n\r\nFranklin the _boy_, walking up Market street, Philadelphia, a\r\npenny-roll under each arm and munching a third, under the laughing\r\nobservation of Miss Read, his future wife--and Franklin the sage and\r\nMinister, representing his government at the most elegant court in\r\nEurope, were contrasted for his edification. Various modern instances\r\nwere added, Mr. Wight keeping in view Pope's axiom that\r\n\r\n    \"Men must be taught as if you taught them not,\r\n    And things unknown proposed as things forgot.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the boy's mind had been sufficiently awakened he followed the\r\nadvice of the old adage to \"strike while the iron is hot,\" and impressed\r\nupon him the fact that being the eldest son he was naturally the prop of\r\nhis house; nor did he ignore the truth, unpalatable as it might be, that\r\nWillard could hope for no material aid from the hands of his parents. He\r\nmust carve his own way. He must build even the ladder up which he was to\r\nclimb. Others had done so--why not he? And then he told him that the way\r\nto do it successfully was to acquire knowledge and cultivate wisdom; for\r\n\r\n    \"Knowledge and wisdom, far from being one,\r\n    Have, oft times, no connection.\r\n    Knowledge dwells in the thoughts of other men,\r\n    Wisdom in minds attentive to their own.\"\r\n\r\nWorking upon what he rightly conjectured to be the boy's newly awakened\r\nsense of the kindness of his father, he spoke of that good man's\r\npecuniary reverses, and professed his faith in Willard as the future\r\nregenerator of the fallen fortunes of Ward Glazier's family.\r\n\r\nThe boy's generous enthusiasm was awakened at once. His ordinary school\r\ntasks and home duties no longer looked commonplace, and were no longer\r\ndistasteful to him. They were but incidents in a general plan of\r\nusefulness, and he performed them with an air of cheerfulness that\r\npleased his teacher and delighted his parents. He volunteered to help\r\nhis father in the fields, and while but a boy in years, he yet performed\r\nthe work of a man. In fact, he had discovered that every duty of life\r\nhas its heroic side, and needs only the impulse of high and noble\r\nmotives to be invested with dignity and interest.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, he did not neglect his studies. The idea of intellectual\r\nculture was no longer a mere abstraction. Books were not only what they\r\nalways had been--reservoirs of knowledge, alluring to his imagination,\r\nand fascinating to his mind--but they were now looked upon as levers,\r\nwith which he was to move the world. Knowledge _now_ meant the means\r\nwhereby, in the days to come, he was to acquire the power to make his\r\nfather and mother comfortable for the balance of their lives; and to\r\nsurround his sisters with those luxuries which go far towards making\r\nexistence a thing of grace and refinement. When, therefore, he worked\r\nduring the warm days of summer, aiding his father in the care of the\r\nfarm, the summer evenings found him poring earnestly over his\r\nbooks--practical and useful ones now--and the harvest once gathered, he\r\nwas back again in his old place at school, where he studied steadily and\r\nhard. His teacher, Allen Wight, looked on and was satisfied. And yet\r\nWillard was a wild boy--as wild as any in the school. His relish for fun\r\nand frolic was as keen as ever, but it was now subordinated to his\r\njudgment. His practical jokes were fewer, and the peculiarities of his\r\nfather no longer furnished him with a subject for their perpetration.\r\nNow and then, however, the old exuberance of mischief _would_ break out,\r\nand upon one occasion his grandfather became its victim.\r\n\r\nAs that mosaic styled \"character\" is nothing more than an aggregate of\r\njust such trivial things, we trust our readers will pardon us if we\r\nrelate the incident in point.\r\n\r\nWhen Willard was over nine years of age, his father moved from the Old\r\nHomestead and purchased a place named the Goodrich Farm, where he opened\r\na country store. The venture proved to be an unfortunate one, and, after\r\na series of pecuniary vicissitudes, he left it, and, at the period to\r\nwhich we refer, was the occupant of a farm known in that section as the\r\nDavis Place.\r\n\r\nThis farm and the Glazier Homestead occupied positions upon opposite\r\nsides of the same public road--the former being one mile nearer the town\r\nof Fullersville.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the Homestead was occupied and cultivated by Jabez Glazier,\r\nthe grandfather of Willard, and upon certain occasions the boy was sent\r\nover to stay for a few days at that place, to help the old gentleman in\r\nmany little ways connected with its cultivation.\r\n\r\nAt that time and in that locality it was customary during the haying\r\nseason to deal out to the men employed stated rations of whiskey every\r\nday. A bottle was filled for each one, and, being placed by the\r\nrecipient in a swathe of the newly-cut grass, frequent visits were made\r\nto the spot and frequent libations indulged in. Ward Glazier and his\r\nwife being determinedly opposed to the use of ardent spirits under any\r\ncircumstances whatever, the custom was dispensed with at the Davis\r\nPlace; but at the Old Homestead, under the rule of Jabez Glazier, the\r\ntime-honored usage was staunchly maintained. Young Willard had been so\r\ndeeply inoculated with his parents' opinions on this subject, that he\r\nhad delivered an address before the society of \"Sons of Temperance\" at\r\nFullerville even at that early age, and his disgust may be imagined when\r\nhe found himself selected by his grandfather to go to the village tavern\r\nfor the necessary quantity of \"Old Rye.\" He asked that some other\r\nmessenger might be sent, but the old gentleman was inflexible. Nobody\r\nbut Willard would satisfy his whim--perhaps because he felt that, in the\r\ncustody of his grandson, the \"fire-water\" would not be tampered with on\r\nits return to the farm. Willard did not openly rebel against his\r\ngrandfather's commands--since it was the fashion in those days for\r\nchildren to be obedient--but turned his attention to gaining his object\r\nby means of a little stratagem. Not far from the house on the road\r\nleading to the store stood an old pump, concealed from view by an\r\nintervening building and a rising hill. Here this youthful disciple of\r\nFather Matthew made it a practice regularly to stop, and pouring out\r\nhalf the contents of the jug he carried, refilled it with the crystal\r\nliquid from the pump.\r\n\r\nAt first this _improvement_ in their potations seemed hardly to attract\r\nthe attention of the individuals interested; but, as each day the\r\nproportion of water increased, the dilution at last forced itself upon\r\ntheir attention, and every one agreed that the tavern-keeper was\r\ncheating Jabez in the \"Rye\" business. The result of it all was the\r\nwithdrawal of Jabez Glazier's custom from the establishment in\r\nquestion, and the future purchase of \"spiritual\" goods by Mr. Jabez\r\nhimself in person.\r\n\r\nThus Willard's object was attained, and the cold-water people were no\r\nlonger vexed by the inconsistent spectacle of a son of temperance\r\nplaying Ganymede to a set of drinking, though by no means drunken,\r\nhay-makers.\r\n\r\nNot often, now, did young Willard figure as chief in any mad scrape or\r\nwild boyish adventure. Those times were left behind. Once, indeed, his\r\nuncle Henry, the patron of the great chief \"_Kaw-shaw-gan-ce_,\" swooped\r\ndown upon the household, and, in an enormous four-horse sleigh of his\r\nown construction, took him, together with a gay and festive party of\r\nlads and lasses, off to Edwards, a village nine miles away. Here the\r\nrustic party had a \"shake-down,\" and young Willard got fearfully sick in\r\na dense atmosphere of tobacco smoke. The feast over, he was tightly\r\npacked in the sleigh with the buxom country girls and their muscular\r\nattendants, while Henry Glazier drove across country through a blinding\r\nsnow-storm and over measureless drifts. The party was stranded at last\r\non a rail fence under the snow, and the living freight flung bodily\r\nforth and buried in the deep drifts. They emerged from their snowy\r\nbaptism with many a laugh and scream and shout, and tramped the\r\nremainder of the distance home. The horses having made good their\r\nescape, Willard was carried forward on his uncle Henry's back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nADVENTURES--EQUINE AND BOVINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ward Glazier moves to the Davis Place.--\"Far in the lane a lonely\r\n    house he found.\"--Who was Davis?--Description of the place.--A\r\n    wild spot for a home.--Willard at work.--Adventure with an\r\n    ox-team.--The road, the bridge and the stream.--\"As an ox\r\n    thirsteth for the water.\"--Dashed from a precipice!--Willard as a\r\n    horse-tamer.--\"Chestnut Bess,\" the blooded mare.--The start for\r\n    home.--\"Bess\" on the rampage.--A lightning dash.--The stooping\r\n    arch.--Bruised and unconscious.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that when Ward Glazier left the Homestead, he\r\nremoved to a neighboring farm known as the Goodrich Place,--a fine,\r\ncomfortable, well-stocked and well-tilled farm, presenting an appearance\r\nof prosperity to the eye of the observer and calculated to make the\r\nimpression that its owner must be well-to-do in the world. As we have\r\nheretofore hinted, however, Ward Glazier failed to prosper there. Why\r\nthis was the case it is hard to tell. A late writer has suggested that\r\n\"not only the higher intellectual gifts but even the finer moral\r\nemotions are an incumbrance to the fortune-hunter.\" That \"a gentle\r\ndisposition and extreme frankness and generosity have been the ruin in a\r\nworldly sense of many a noble spirit;\" and he adds that \"there is a\r\ndegree of cautiousness and distrust and a certain insensibility and\r\nsternness that seem essential to a man who has to bustle through the\r\nworld and engineer his own affairs,\"--and if he be right, the matter\r\nmay be easily understood.\r\n\r\nHowever that may be, he failed to prosper, and as business misfortunes\r\nbegan to fall thick and fast upon his head, he gave up the farm to his\r\ncreditors, together with all his other effects, and took up his abode at\r\nthe Davis Place.\r\n\r\nWho the particular Davis was whose name clung to the place we have been\r\nunable to ascertain, but when Ward Glazier moved there, the house seemed\r\nfairly to scowl upon the passer-by--so utterly unprepossessing was its\r\nappearance. A rude, capacious wooden structure, it stood fronting the\r\nhighway, and was a place where the beautiful had no existence. The very\r\nsoil looked black and rough--the vegetation rugged. Every inclosure was\r\nof stone or knotted timber, and even a dove-cot which in its fresher\r\ndays some hand had placed upon the lawn, was now roofless and shattered,\r\nand lay prone upon the ground, a shapeless mass of collapsed boards. The\r\nlawn--if such it could be named--resembled a bleak shore, blackened with\r\nstranded wrecks of ships whose passengers had long years before gone\r\ndown at sea. The broken windows in the dormitories were festooned with\r\ncobwebs that had housed long lines of ancestral spiders, and where a\r\npane or two of glass remained among the many empty frames, one fancied a\r\ngibbering spectre might look out from the gloomy depths behind.\r\n\r\nThe back-ground against which this bleak and sombre place was thrown was\r\nno less grim and stern. Huge rocks in tiers, like stone coffins, rose in\r\nfierce ranges one above another up and up--back and farther back until\r\nthey reached a point from whence a miniature forest of dwarf beech and\r\nmaple, that appeared to crown the topmost bastion of them all, nodded in\r\nthe swaying wind like funeral plumes upon a Titan's hearse.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the only gleam of light upon the place--and it was a crazy,\r\nfitful gleam at that--came from a rushing stream that took its source\r\nhigh up among the hills. This brook first seen off to the extreme left\r\nof the house, came dashing down the rocks until it reached a level.\r\nThen, swinging round with sudden swirl it engirdled the place, and after\r\nmany a curious twist and turn got straight again and went onward far off\r\namong the neighboring fields and lost itself at last in the Oswegatchie.\r\nThe interior of the house was just as wild and dreary as the exterior.\r\nThe rooms, for the most part, were too large for comfort. When one\r\nspoke, a dozen ghostly echoes answered, and at twilight the smaller\r\nchildren huddled around the kitchen fire and seldom went beyond that\r\ncheerful room until bed time. Often, in the dead of night, the creaking\r\nof timber and the voices of the wind startled the little ones from\r\nsleep, and a sense of something unreal and mysterious overshadowed their\r\nyoung minds.\r\n\r\nIt was, take it all in all, a grim, gaunt, strange place in which to fix\r\na home. It was there, however, in the midst of such sterile\r\nsurroundings, that the next five years of Willard's life were mainly\r\npassed. There were no external influences brought to bear upon this\r\nportion of his existence that were not harsh and wild and stern. His\r\nfather, honest even to the verge of fanaticism, was letting his heart\r\ncorrode to bitterness under the sense of hopeless indebtedness. The\r\nchurlish fields attached to the place offered but a grudging reward for\r\nthe hardest labor. There was no hope of his acquiring a profession or\r\neven an education beyond the scant opportunity of Allen Wight's school,\r\nunless he himself could earn the means to pay for it. Still he was\r\nneither discouraged nor without hope. Instead of sinking under this\r\naccumulation of difficulties, his moral fibre was rendered more robust,\r\nand with it his physical strength and usefulness developed daily.\r\n\r\nThus a year sped on, and at the end of that time his father, as one\r\nmeans of adding something to his scanty resources, obtained the job of\r\nhauling a quantity of iron ore from the ore beds near Little York to a\r\nforge and furnace at Fullerville. Willard with an ox-team and his uncle\r\nHenry with a span of fine horses, were employed for the most part to do\r\nthe actual hauling.\r\n\r\nBy this time Willard was quite familiar with the management of horses,\r\nand he had also learned to drive oxen, so that at the age of thirteen he\r\nworked with his ox-team as regularly and almost as efficiently as any of\r\nhis grown-up uncles or even his father. The management of an ox-team, by\r\nthe way, is quite different from that of horses, and at times it becomes\r\nvery troublesome business, requiring for its successful accomplishment\r\nthe very nicest admixture of courage, coolness and discretion. Willard,\r\nhowever, with the self-reliance that always characterizes a boy of his\r\nage, never for a moment doubted that he was adequate to the task, and as\r\nhe had been placed in charge of a very fine yoke of oxen, took much\r\npride in driving them in the same manner as he would have driven a span\r\nof horses, seated on the top of his load upon the wagon instead of being\r\non foot and close by their heads, as prudence would have taught an\r\nolder driver to do. The truth is, that if there was any human being\r\nbefore whom the boy delighted to exhibit himself as doing a manly part\r\nin his little circle of existence, that being was Henry Glazier.\r\n\r\nConsequently, when his uncle's team was on the road, Master Willard took\r\na position upon his own load with as important an air as if he were on\r\nthe box of a coach-and-four, and guided his cattle as if they were\r\nanimals of the most docile disposition, to halt at his whisper or\r\nproceed at his word. As the principal part of the work was performed at\r\nmidsummer under the rays of a scorching sun, the cattle were, of course,\r\nirritable and restive to a degree that in colder weather would have\r\nseemed inconsistent with the phlegmatic characteristics of their race.\r\n\r\nThe road from Little York to Fullerville is a winding, narrow road,\r\nsomewhat hilly in places, and neither very smooth nor level at any\r\npoint. Midway between the two villages a brawling stream crosses the\r\nroad, and making a turn empties itself, at the distance of about thirty\r\nyards, into the waters of the Oswegatchie. This stream is spanned by a\r\nrustic bridge at a very considerable elevation above the water. The\r\nbanks are high and abrupt, and, as the traveler approaches them, he\r\ncannot fail to be attracted by the silvery sparkle of the waters far\r\nbelow. The view from the bridge takes in the white farm-houses with\r\ntheir emerald setting of rich grain-fields and meadowlands, the distant\r\nforge with its belching smoke-stacks, the winding Oswegatchie, and the\r\ndistant blue hills. If the month happens to be August, the traveler may\r\nhear the cheerful hum of busy industry, the swinging cradles of the\r\nharvesters or the steady roll of the reaper. Upon a day, late in this\r\nrichest of summer months--August--in the year of our Lord 1854, Willard\r\nand his uncle Henry were slowly wending their way towards\r\nFullerville--the former with his ox-team and the latter with a spanking\r\nspan of horses. The beasts of burden by their drooping heads and slow\r\npace evinced the fact that the loads of ore they were drawing were\r\nunusually heavy, and this, combined with the sultry atmosphere, was\r\ntelling upon the strength of even such powerful beasts as they.\r\n\r\nWillard, as usual, was seated upon the top of his load, and, as they\r\nneared the bridge, despite his familiarity with every detail of the\r\nscene, a sense of its exquisite beauty took possession of him, and, for\r\na moment, he forgot that he was driving an ox-team. For a moment he was\r\noblivious to the fact that it takes all a driver's care and skill to\r\nprevent mischief whenever a thirsty ox obtains a glimpse of water upon a\r\nsummer's day. As they neared the bridge, the fevered eyes of the cattle\r\ncaught sight of the limpid stream away down below, and, just as a cry of\r\nwarning from his uncle recalled the boy to a sense of the deadly peril\r\nof his position, the cattle made an oblique plunge over the edge of the\r\nbank with two tons of iron-ore in lumps varying from five pounds to\r\nfifty, pouring a huge and deadly hail over their reckless heads. With\r\nrare presence of mind for a boy of his age, the instant he heard his\r\nuncle's warning cry, Willard realized the situation and jumped sideways\r\nfrom the wagon. As he did so, his hat fell off and rolled a short\r\ndistance away. At the same moment a lump of ore, weighing not less than\r\none-hundred pounds, fell upon it and crushed it so deeply into the\r\nground that it was completely hidden from view. Many months afterwards,\r\nsome boys digging for fish-bait found the hat buried there, and returned\r\nto the village with a tale of some possible and unknown murder,\r\ncommitted when or by whom no one could tell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tragic Experience With An Ox-team.]\r\n\r\nAs for the boy himself, he escaped with only a scratch or two and a few\r\nbruises, but that he escaped with his life or with sound limbs was\r\nalmost a miracle; and, as his big-hearted uncle picked him up, he hugged\r\nthe lad as one snatched from the very jaws of death. Willard was\r\nsomewhat awed by the narrowness of his escape, and it was observed that\r\nhis face wore an expression a shade graver than was its wont for several\r\ndays after the occurrence.\r\n\r\nThe lesson, however, made no lasting impression. Scarce a week had gone\r\nby ere his life was once more imperilled, and this time the danger\r\nresulted from his own reckless over-confidence in himself.\r\n\r\nIt is a singular fact in the boy's history that every danger to which at\r\nthis period of his life he was exposed, seems to have been twin-brother\r\nto some other hazard equally great, and which tripped upon its very\r\nheels.\r\n\r\nAs already stated, Willard was a good horseman for a boy of his age. He\r\npossessed considerable nerve, and, having been brought up among horses,\r\nknew a good deal about their ways. But his real knowledge upon the\r\nsubject was nothing to that which he thought he possessed; and, though a\r\nstout little fellow, of course he lacked the muscle of steel that is\r\nrequired to master an enraged horse. But he had never hesitated to ride\r\nany steed in all that neighborhood, with the single exception of one of\r\na pair of extremely beautiful but vicious mares, which on account of her\r\ncolor was named \"Chestnut Bess.\"\r\n\r\nThis horse was as wild and untamed as the famous steed of Mazeppa, and\r\neven Henry Glazier, master-horseman though he was, seldom attempted to\r\nuse this one, except in harness with her mate. The knowledge of this\r\nfact excited an overweening desire in Willard's breast to show them what\r\n_he_ could do in the way of taming the hitherto untamed creature, and\r\nnever having been unhorsed in his life, he determined, upon the first\r\nfavorable opportunity, to try his powers upon the vicious animal. That\r\nopportunity was not long in coming. One summer morning it was arranged\r\nthat Willard should go over to his grandfather's and aid in the\r\ncultivation of a large corn-field on the Homestead Farm. Willard made up\r\nhis mind that, if he went, he would go in style on the back of \"Chestnut\r\nBess.\" He wanted to show his Uncle Henry and the others what the \"little\r\nrunt\" was capable of accomplishing as an equestrian. Accordingly, he\r\nplaced a good strong bridle upon the mare's head, gave an extra pull at\r\nthe saddle-girth to assure himself there was no possibility of _that_\r\nfailing him, and, taking a hoe, which he wished to use in his work on\r\nthe farm, in his right hand, he led the mare quietly down the path, out\r\nthrough the gate, and into the road. Gathering the reins in his left\r\nhand, without giving her time to conjecture his object--for mounting her\r\nwas no easy task--he jumped lightly into the saddle, and screwed his\r\nknees into her sides with all his might.\r\n\r\nNow, this mare was not one of those ordinary quadrupeds possessing a\r\nsingle vice, which the rider may learn and master. She was an animal of\r\ninfinite resources. Her modes of attack were innumerable. It is true she\r\nrather preferred to settle matters upon the very threshold of the\r\ncontest in a short, sharp way, by kicking her man before he could mount.\r\nBut, if baffled in this design, she would vary the proceedings by\r\ndashing her head down between her knees, sending her heels up in the\r\nair, and, if possible, plunge the rider over her head to the ground; or,\r\nshe would waltz round on her hind legs in such a way as to render the\r\nbest balanced brain somewhat dizzy and uncertain; in the event of the\r\nfailure of these coquettish pleasantries, she had not a single scruple\r\nagainst playing Shylock, and taking her pound of flesh out of his leg\r\nwith her teeth. Thus, you see, it would not do to go to sleep upon her\r\nback; and Master Willard Glazier no sooner found himself firmly seated\r\nthan he made up his mind that for the time, at least, he had his hands\r\nfull of business. As the mare had been deprived of an opportunity to\r\nkick him, by the suddenness with which he sprang upon her back, she\r\nconcluded to try her next favorite line of strategy and shake him off.\r\nSo down went her head and up went her heels, and, had he been less on\r\nthe alert, he must have gone to earth; but, with his knees dug into her\r\nsides as if they were the opposite jaws of a vice, for every jerk of her\r\nhead _down_ he gave one with the reins _up_, and at each jerk the\r\nhoe-handle gave her a rap over the ears, so that she began to find the\r\nfun less agreeable than usual. Changing her tactics, with a bound she\r\nproceeded to execute a fine imitation of the \"German,\" and spin round\r\nlike a Fifth Avenue belle or a humming-top. But the boy's young, clear,\r\ntemperate brain and well-disciplined nerves were proof even against this\r\nstyle of attack, and still firm in his seat, he belabored the brute with\r\nhis hoe with such a perfect rain of blows that she gave up her prancing\r\nand dashed down the road at a break-neck pace. For perhaps five hundred\r\nyards the road led down hill, and then, crossing a stream, ascended\r\nagain, the ascent being quite steep and by no means smooth.\r\n\r\nWhile upon the descent, it was all Willard could do to hold on, for he\r\nwas encumbered with the hoe, which at every jump of the mare struck the\r\ntop of her head, until she absolutely flew. The few pedestrians upon the\r\nroad that morning stopped in amazement to stare after the mad flight of\r\nhorse and rider.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the bridge was crossed and they commenced the abrupt rise,\r\n\"Chestnut Bess\" began to slacken her pace, but the young gentleman, who\r\nby this time considered himself her master, would not agree to this. He\r\nproposed to give her a lesson, so he administered a good thrashing with\r\nhis novel style of whip and compelled her to keep her pace all the way\r\nto the top of the hill, where horse and rider at length arrived in\r\nsafety. From that point to the Old Homestead the mare was perfectly\r\nwilling to jog along quietly, and when they reached the farm you may be\r\nsure that the \"spirit\" of one \"mortal\" at least was \"proud,\" as he\r\nrelated to his wondering kinsman how he had taken the mischief out of\r\nthe chestnut mare.\r\n\r\nThe boy rose immeasurably in his uncle Henry's estimation by this feat,\r\nand all were delighted with his pluck, though Jabez Glazier, his\r\ngrandfather, with his greater experience, warned him not to trust the\r\nbeast too far, for, according to his belief, her eye had danger in it\r\nyet. When the day of work was ended, Willard once more mounted upon\r\n\"Chestnut Bess\" and rode towards home. For a short time the mare trotted\r\nquietly along, and the boy was more than ever convinced that he had\r\nbroken her of her tricks.\r\n\r\nThis agreeable belief however was of short duration. The thought had\r\nhardly entered his head when she commenced her antics again. Her heels\r\nwent skyward and her nose went down, and a repetition of the morning's\r\nperformances succeeded.\r\n\r\nThere was quite as much vigor and pertinacity in her movements as if she\r\nwere just starting out for the day. This time Willard had provided\r\nhimself with a stout beech switch, and used its stinging persuasion with\r\ngood effect. She danced, she pranced, she waltzed, she made sudden\r\ndashes and full stops. She would have rolled in the gravel if the boy's\r\nswitch had ceased stinging her into motives for action, but she could\r\nnot shake him off. He clung to her back like a little leech, and it\r\nbegan to look as if human will-power was going to conquer brute\r\nstubbornness, when suddenly a new idea seemed to enter the animal's\r\nhead. Without a moment's warning, and utterly scorning the control of\r\nthe bit which she had taken in her teeth, she swung round and at full\r\ngallop made straight for the Homestead farm from which she had so lately\r\ncome. The farm-yard gate was wide open and she dashed in, making\r\ndirectly for the wagon-shed at the extreme end of the place, which was\r\nnow empty. This shed, the top of which was supported by a cross-beam,\r\nwas only just high enough to permit a wagon to be sheltered there, and\r\nif the horse got in, Willard saw at a glance that she would be obliged\r\nto lower her head to do so, and that in the course of her entry he must\r\ninevitably strike the beam and perhaps be instantly killed or swept off\r\nher back upon a pile of rocks that on either side walled the entrance to\r\nthe shed.\r\n\r\nHis heart for once failed him, for there seemed no earthly hope of\r\nescape. There was no time to spring off, even if the speed at which he\r\nwas going would have permitted him to do so, for in a shorter time than\r\nit has taken to describe the scene, the shed was reached, bang went the\r\nmare's head against the opposite end, and at the same instant Willard\r\nfelt a dull thud against his person, realized the fact that he was being\r\nthrown into the air, and then came darkness and unconsciousness. He was\r\ndashed violently upon the stones, and when picked up his body was found\r\nto be much lacerated and bruised.\r\n\r\nFortunately, however, no bones were broken, though he was obliged to\r\nkeep his bed for some days afterwards. No doubt while lying there during\r\nslow convalescence he mused upon the vicissitudes attendant upon the\r\ncareer of a horse-tamer. At all events from this time he became much\r\nsteadier and more prudent,--the wild adventures of his earlier boyhood\r\nhaving entirely lost their attraction for him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG TRAPPER OF THE OSWEGATCHIE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  A plan of life.--Determination to procure an education.--A\r\n    substitute at the plow.--His father acquiesces in his\r\n    determination to become a trapper.--Life in the wild woods along\r\n    the Oswegatchie.--The six \"dead-falls.\"--First success.--A\r\n    fallacious calculation.--The goal attained.--Seventy-five dollars\r\n    in hard cash!--Four terms of academic life.--The youthful\r\n    rivals.--Lessons in elocution.--A fight with hair-brushes and\r\n    chairs!--\"The walking ghost of a kitchen fire.\"--Renewed\r\n    friendship.--Teaching to obtain means for an education.\r\n\r\nAt this period of Willard's life, he is described by Mr. Rennehan as\r\nhaving acquired an appetite for the acquisition of knowledge which soon\r\nbecame the controlling passion of his nature, and, \"thoroughly absorbed\r\nby this idea, he fixed upon the select school of his native town as the\r\ninstitution best adapted to initiate him in the course suited to the\r\nfulfilment of his laudable ambition.\"\r\n\r\nBut his determination to procure an education met with obstacles from\r\nthe outset. How to defray the necessary expenses which such a course\r\ninvolved was the question which continually presented itself for his\r\ningenuity to solve. His father's reverses placed it quite beyond the\r\npossibilities to hire help upon the farm, and Willard's services had\r\ntherefore come to be looked upon as something of vital importance.\r\n\r\nIn dragging from the hard soil of the Davis place the living which\r\nnecessity compelled, he performed the work of a man, and the perfect\r\ntrust which his father reposed in him gave his services additional\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nThis fact increased the difficulty of his position; but though he made\r\nit a point to husband all his spare time for self-instruction, he was\r\nfar from satisfied with the existing state of affairs, and pondered long\r\nand earnestly over the best means of securing the advantages of regular\r\ninstruction.\r\n\r\nAt that time the streams tributary to the St. Lawrence were supplied\r\nwith such fur-bearing animals as the mink, the musk-rat, the otter, and\r\nthe more humble rabbit, the skins of all of which were more or less\r\nvaluable and were sought by professional trappers. These men found the\r\nbusiness a reasonably lucrative one, and it commended itself especially\r\nto Willard, as health and strength were the only capital required. The\r\ngrand difficulty was how to supply his place in the work of the farm.\r\nHis father was a man who always listened with patience and sympathy to\r\nany scheme that promised to benefit his children. His son, therefore,\r\nhad no hesitation in laying the whole matter before him and seeking his\r\nadvice upon the subject. He felt, of course, that any proposal to\r\nwithdraw his personal labor from the common stock of exertion by which\r\nthe cultivation of the farm was rendered a possibility, was a direct\r\npecuniary tax upon his father's resources; but he believed he could to a\r\ngreat extent neutralize the injury by supplying a substitute.\r\n\r\nHe also felt assured that although the step he proposed to take might be\r\na present loss to the family it would prove an ultimate gain. He was\r\nthoroughly determined to make _his_ life a success, and he was just as\r\nthoroughly determined that any success which might crown his efforts\r\nshould be shared by his parents. It is true that the road looked long\r\nand the path rough, but he had a \"heart for any fate,\" and his courage\r\nnever failed. A substitute at the plow he knew he could obtain for a\r\nsmall sum, and the board of such a person would take the place of his\r\nown at the home table, and he never doubted that he could earn a\r\nsufficient surplus to pay the wages of such an assistant. At all events\r\nhe made up his mind to try the experiment.\r\n\r\nWith young Willard, to think was to act, and this project was no sooner\r\nconceived than he proceeded to put it into execution. He laid his plans\r\nfrankly before his father, who, to his great gratification, assented to\r\nhis proposal. A man was hired for fifteen dollars a month to take\r\nWillard's place on the farm, and the latter made his first venture as a\r\ntrapper.\r\n\r\nHis initial experiment was to set six traps of the pattern called a\r\n\"dead-fall\" or \"figure of four,\" and this resulted in the capture of two\r\nminks worth about eight dollars. With what an exultant heart he drew out\r\nhis first mink and realized that by his own unaided exertions he had\r\nmade some money, no boy or man need be told. He at once, however,\r\nentered into some rather fallacious calculations and built some\r\nextremely airy castles. It occurred to him that if out of six traps he\r\ncould obtain two skins, out of one hundred he could obtain thirty-three,\r\nand so on, in proportion.\r\n\r\nThis, however, proved to be a miscalculation, it not being so much the\r\nnumber of traps set, as the quantity of game in a given locality which\r\nregulates the amount of success for a trapper. Yet his efforts in this\r\nnew business succeeded to a gratifying degree, and the fact of having\r\nexchanged the dull monotony of farm drudgery for the exhilarating\r\nexcitement of a hunter's life, was in itself a sufficient reward for any\r\namount of exertion. Indeed what mode of life could be happier or more\r\nfree, for a healthy, strong-limbed youth of fifteen, than to live as he\r\nthen did, almost entirely in the woods? Then too, his daily route lay in\r\nthe midst of some of the finest scenery to be found anywhere in New\r\nYork, even in that grand old county of St. Lawrence.\r\n\r\nTo a lover of nature nothing could be more alluring than the locality\r\nthrough which Willard, at that period of his life, trapped and hunted.\r\nTo follow the winding waters of the Oswegatchie is to enjoy a perpetual\r\nfeast. That river is one of a great family of rivers, among which may be\r\nenumerated the Rackett, the Grasse, the Indian, and the Black, all of\r\nwhich take their rise far up in the recesses of the great North Woods.\r\nThough not to any extent navigable, it is yet nearly as broad as the\r\nlovely and \"blue Juniata\" of \"peaceful Pennsylvania.\"\r\n\r\nAt times turbulent and brawling, it is often vexed in its passage to the\r\nSt. Lawrence by rapids and cataracts varying in height and volume, but\r\nwhich in their infinite variety give a wild and romantic beauty to this\r\npoetical stream. At times it glides smoothly along through low meadow\r\nlands, and again it plunges into some dense thicket or brawls through\r\nsome briery dell where the foliage is so thick that one can only see\r\nthe glint and ripple of its waters at rare intervals, shining between\r\nthe lapping leaves and tangled vines. Then again it sweeps onward\r\nthrough cleft rocks and jutting banks until, lost at last in the very\r\nheart of the primeval forest, its twilight waters reflect the images of\r\ngiant trees which had their beginning on its banks a century ago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Young Trapper Of The Oswegatchie.]\r\n\r\nWillard's life during that autumn passed in persevering work. Day by day\r\nhe traveled his accustomed routes, while the leaves turned from green to\r\nred and from red to russet and brown, and at last fell from the naked\r\nbranches of the forest trees with a little farewell rustle, to be\r\ntrodden into the rich soil below.\r\n\r\nBy the time the first snow came he found himself much more robust\r\nphysically, and with seventy-five dollars clear profit in his pocket. In\r\naddition to these advantages he also acquired the inestimable habit of\r\nself-reliance, so that when he entered upon a course of preparation for\r\nhis academic life, it was with full faith in himself. For four terms,\r\nbeginning August thirteenth, 1857, and ending the latter part of June,\r\n1859, he remained at the excellent institution of learning which he had\r\nselected, and while there gained considerable credit as a hard student.\r\n\r\nDuring the first of these terms a generous rivalry existed between\r\nhimself and a youth by the name of Albert Burt, as to which should lead\r\nthe class. As it turned out, however, they kept together and were both\r\nmarked \"perfect.\" The academy was under the management of the Rev. E. C.\r\nBruce, M. A., Principal; and Andrew Roe, Professor of Mathematics. About\r\na month or six weeks after he entered the school, he arranged to take\r\nlessons in elocution under a Professor Bronson, that gentleman having\r\norganized a large class at the academy.\r\n\r\nIn a brief diary kept by him at the time, we find the remark that he was\r\n\"greatly pleased with the Professor's method of teaching that important\r\nbranch of study.\" Willard had advanced to the higher grade of Algebra\r\nand Grammar, had added Philosophy to the list of his studies, and having\r\ncultivated a natural turn for public speaking, was elected on the\r\neighteenth of December, 1857, a member of the Oratorical Society--an\r\nassociation connected with the institution. His boy experiences were\r\nvery similar to those which happen to all lads in academic life. He had\r\nhis chums, among whom were Brayton Abbott and Ozias Johnson; he had his\r\nlittle flirtations with misses of his own age, and he had his fights, as\r\nall boys have.\r\n\r\nAmong the latter was one with Johnson, who was his room-mate, and who,\r\nbeing four years older than himself, undertook, for fun, to rub his face\r\nwith a newly-purchased hair-brush. This kind of fun did not suit\r\nWillard, however, and he resented it by giving Johnson a \"dig\" in the\r\nribs. Whereupon a fight ensued in earnest, and as Willard was too young\r\nand light to keep up the contest at close quarters, he dodged his\r\nadversary and covered his retreat by dropping chairs in front of\r\nJohnson's legs, which brought that young gentleman to the floor more\r\nthan once, to his own intense disgust and Willard's great gratification.\r\nAt length Johnson managed to corner his opponent, and then rubbed his\r\nface so thoroughly with the bristles that his comrades that morning\r\nthought he had caught the scarlet-fever, or as Dickens says, that he\r\nwas the \"walking ghost of a kitchen fire.\"\r\n\r\nAs generally happens, however, between two manly fellows, their combat\r\ninspired a feeling of mutual respect, and from being mere acquaintances\r\nthey grew to be fast friends.\r\n\r\nStudy and sedentary habits at length so much impaired Willard's health\r\nthat, in the latter part of the month of August, 1858, he was compelled\r\nto cease his attendance at school and go home. The thirtieth of\r\nSeptember following, however, found him at the Teachers' Institute of\r\nSt. Lawrence County, with the proceedings of which body he appears to\r\nhave been highly gratified, for in the diary to which we have already\r\nreferred, he speaks of it in these words:--\r\n\r\n\"I am now attending the Teachers' Institute of this county, which is in\r\nsession at Gouverneur, it having opened upon the twenty-seventh instant.\r\nThe School Commissioners are Mr. C. C. Church and Allen Wight. I am\r\nhighly pleased with the proceedings and the method of conducting the\r\nexercises of this apparently indispensable part of a Teacher's\r\ninstruction,\"--adding that it was his \"intention to become a teacher the\r\ncoming winter.\" Indeed, to be a teacher seems to have been his favorite\r\nscheme of life, and his highest ambition was ultimately to fill the\r\nchair of Mathematics in one of the great institutions of learning. That\r\nmost exact of sciences was his favorite branch of study, and the\r\nintellectual stimulus which it imparts had for him a peculiar\r\nfascination.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of his object, and in order, by teaching during one part of\r\nthe year, to raise means to enable him to attend school during another\r\nportion, he set about procuring for himself a school. Fortunately for\r\nthe accomplishment of his object, it was suggested to him to apply to\r\nthe School Commissioner of his own Assembly district, and he did so. The\r\nexamination which followed his application, owing to some local rivalry,\r\nwas extremely rigid; but he passed through it with great credit and\r\nreceived the appointment he desired, being assigned forthwith to duty in\r\nthe town of Edwards, St. Lawrence County. He commenced teaching in the\r\nbleak month of November, 1858, and was very earnest in fulfilling the\r\nduties of his position, taking every opportunity not only of instilling\r\nknowledge into the minds of his pupils, but also striving to imbue them\r\nwith a love of self-culture. He labored hard in his efforts to earn\r\nmeans with which to support himself during the coming summer at the\r\nGouverneur Wesleyan Seminary, and discovered while thus working that\r\nteaching was as much of a discipline for himself as for his pupils.\r\n\r\nThe time does not seem to have passed unpleasantly to him at this period\r\nof his career, for in an entry made in his diary on the twenty-eighth of\r\nNovember, 1858, he says:\r\n\r\n\"I am spending the evening with Mr. Hiram Harris and family, having come\r\ninto the district this afternoon. My mission here is to teach school for\r\na term of three months in fulfilment of the contract existing between\r\nthe trustees and myself. In compliance with a custom that prevails, I am\r\nexpected to 'board around,' as it is styled, and Mr. Harris, being one\r\nof the Trustees, has invited me to spend my first week at his house.\r\n\r\n\"The School Commissioner of this Assembly district is Mr. C. C. Church,\r\nof Potsdam, from whom I received a certificate based upon the\r\nrecommendation of Commissioner Allen Wight of the first district. The\r\nSchool Trustees are E. L. Beardsley, Hiram Harris, and Jeptha Clark. The\r\npresent term will be my first experience in the profession I have\r\nadopted. I do hope it will prove a useful one, for I am of opinion that\r\na teacher's first experience is apt to give color to his whole future\r\ncareer.\" The day after this entry he adds that \"only a small attendance\r\ngreeted me upon opening my school,\" and after consoling himself with the\r\nreflection that this will leave him plenty of time for study, he adopted\r\na single rule--\"Do right;\" and an additional motto, \"A time and place\r\nfor everything and everything in its time and place.\"\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that he had already acquired a clear idea of the\r\nimportance of order in every pursuit, and knew that method gives to an\r\nordinary mortal Briaerean arms with which to accomplish whatever he may\r\ndesire to do. How few attain to this knowledge until it is too late!\r\n\r\nAs a writer, whose words we think worthy of remembrance, has said:\r\n\r\n\"This is an era of doing things scientifically. People make scientific\r\ncalculations of the weather, and the average number of murders for the\r\nnext year. They measure the stars and they measure the affections, both\r\nscientifically. The only thing they fail to do scientifically is, to\r\nmanage themselves. As a rule, they _drift_, and then find fault with\r\nfate and Providence because they don't drift into the right port. They\r\ndrift _into_ life with a multiplicity of vague dreams, which are\r\nsomehow to be realized; but they have a very dim idea of ways and means.\r\nThey drift _through_ it, carelessly, with an inadequate knowledge of\r\ntheir own resources, and a still more inadequate notion of using them to\r\nthe best advantage; they drift _out_ of it with a melancholy sense of\r\nfailure, both absolutely as to themselves and relatively as to the\r\nworld. Of all their splendid possibilities, none are realized. Nothing\r\nis completed. They start wrong or they make one fatal step, and\r\neverything goes wrong all the way through. It seems as if most lives\r\nwere only experiments. Now and then one is turned out which fits in its\r\nniche and is tolerably symmetrical. The rest are all awry, unfinished,\r\nmisplaced, and merely faint suggestions of what might have been. Much of\r\nthis is doubtless beyond mortal control, but a far greater portion is\r\ndue to the lack of a nice direction of forces. The human mechanism is\r\ncomplicated, and a very slight flaw sets it all wrong. There may be too\r\nmuch steam or too much friction, or too little power or too little\r\nbalance. But clearly the first step is to strengthen the weak points, to\r\ngauge its capabilities, to set it running smoothly, and to give it a\r\ndefinite aim. If existence were simply passive and the mission of man\r\nwas to _be_ instead of to _do_, he might perhaps be left to develop as\r\nthe trees do, according to his own will or fancy or according to certain\r\nnatural laws. But as it is the universal wish wherever one is, to be\r\nsomewhere else, a little higher in the scale, it seems to be a part of\r\nwisdom, as well as humanity, to fit one for climbing. But many an\r\naspirant finds his wings clipped in the beginning of his career, through\r\nthe ignorance or carelessness of his friends, who never took the trouble\r\nof measuring his capabilities. He is treated as a receptacle into which\r\na certain amount of ideas are to be poured, no matter whether they may\r\nanswer to anything within him or not. He is turned out of an educational\r\nmill with five hundred others, and with plenty of loose knowledge, but\r\nwithout the remotest idea of what to do with it, or what nature intended\r\nhim for, and with no especial fitness for any one thing. He can _think_,\r\nprobably, if he has the requisite amount of brains, but how to establish\r\na relation between thought and bread and butter is the problem. He has\r\nthe requisite motive power, but it is not attached to anything. _He_\r\ndoes not know how to attach it, so he revolves in a circle, or makes a\r\nseries of floundering experiments, that bear meagre fruit, perhaps when\r\nthe better part of his life is gone. He knows _books_, but he does _not_\r\nknow men. He is a master of theories, but cannot apply them. If he has a\r\nsmall amount of brains, his case is still more hopeless. To be sure, a\r\nproper amount of knowledge has been poured in, but it has all slipped\r\nthrough. He might have assimilated some other kind of knowledge, but\r\nthat particular kind has left him with mental dyspepsia, and a vague\r\nfeeling of hopelessness which is likely to prove fatal to all useful\r\neffort. Or perhaps he has talent, but is destitute of the requisite tact\r\nto make it tell upon the world. His success depends largely on his power\r\nto move others, but he has no lever and is forced to rely upon main\r\nstrength, which involves a serious expenditure of vitality, with only\r\ndoubtful results. He works all his life against perpetual friction,\r\nbecause no one had the foresight or insight to discern that this was the\r\nflaw in his machinery.\r\n\r\n\"Another fatal point is in the choice of a vocation. Having drifted\r\nthrough an education, he next drifts into his business or profession. He\r\nrarely stops to take an inventory of his capital, or, at best, he takes\r\na very partial one. Chance or circumstance decides him. His grandfather\r\nsits on the judge's bench. He thinks the judge's bench a desirable\r\nplace, so he takes to the law. He puts on his grandfather's coat without\r\nthe slightest reference to whether it will fit or not. Perhaps he\r\nintends to grow to _it_, but a willow sapling cannot grow into an oak.\r\nIt may grow into a very respectable willow, but if it aspires to the\r\nhigher dignity, it will most likely get crushed or blown over. It may be\r\nthat he has a grand vision of commercial splendor, and plunges into\r\nbusiness life with a very good idea of Sophocles and Horace and no idea\r\nwhatever of trade; with a very good talent for theories, but none\r\nwhatever for facts; with some insight into metaphysics, but none at all\r\ninto people. Instead of trying his strength in shallow waters, he starts\r\nto cross the Atlantic in a very small skiff. By the time he has reached\r\nmid-ocean he discovers his error, but it is too late to turn back; so he\r\nis buffeted about by winds and waves until he, too, goes down and counts\r\namong the failures.\r\n\r\n\"Another of the few points upon which life hinges is marriage, and\r\npeople drift into that as they do into everything else. It is one of the\r\nthings to be done in order to complete the circle of human experience. A\r\nman is caught by a pretty face and a winning smile. He takes no thought\r\nof the new element he is adding to his life, either with reference to\r\nhis outward career or his inward needs. Caprice governs his choice, or\r\nperhaps a hard form of self-interest. Having committed one or two of\r\nthe grand errors of life, he settles down to its serious business, and\r\nspeedily discovers that he has a dead weight to carry. He has mistaken\r\nhis vocation, whatever it may be.\r\n\r\n\"He is conscious now that it is too late to change; that he might have\r\nattained supreme excellence in some other calling. He toils with heavy\r\nheart and sinking spirit at the plodding pace of dull mediocrity. His\r\nwork is drudgery and wearies him body and soul. Those who once smiled\r\nupon him pass him by. Men of far inferior capabilities distance him in\r\nthe race. Perhaps too he has made another misstep, and has a wife who\r\nsympathizes neither with his tastes nor his trials: who has no\r\ncomprehension of him whatever, save that he is a being whose business it\r\nis to love her and furnish her with spending money. The beauty which\r\nfascinated him has grown faded and insipid. The pretty coquetries that\r\nwon him pall upon him; he is absolutely alone with the burden of life\r\npressing heavily upon him. Is it strange that he is mastered in the\r\nbattle and finally falls beneath the world's pitiless tread? This is a\r\nsad little picture, but it is an every-day one, and the world goes on\r\nits way as before.\r\n\r\n\"What matters it that a lonely, dissipated man has lain down in sorrow\r\nto rise no more! The world cannot stop to weep over the remains of the\r\ndeparted one it has trampled upon. Those whose business it is can take\r\nthem on one side, lay them away under the green sod out of sight, shed a\r\ntear perhaps, and pass on until their turn comes to lay down wearily, go\r\nto sleep, and be laid away. The world chides, the world laughs, but it\r\ntakes no cognizance of the grief--\r\n\r\n    \"'That inward breaks and shows no cause without,\r\n    _Why_ the man dies.'\r\n\r\n\"Yet there is but the difference of a point in the game between the\r\nvictim and the hero. The cards are the same, or the victim, perhaps,\r\n_may_ hold the best trumps, but he plays recklessly, loses his point,\r\nloses his game, loses all! On such slight things does human destiny\r\nhinge. The hero has all his resources at command--his game dimly\r\noutlined. He knows his winning cards, and he plays them skilfully.\r\n\r\n\"Every point tells. Nothing is left to chance that can be accomplished\r\nby foresight. He wins the game. He wins the prizes. He has the mastery\r\nof life. The world takes off its hat to him. Fortune and people smile\r\nupon him. Not that he is better than others--very likely he is not so\r\ngood. But the world counts results. Becky Sharp is not a model, but\r\nBecky Sharp is a power. The world does not like her in the abstract, but\r\nit likes her dinners, it courts her smiles, it fawns upon her, it\r\nshowers its good things upon her, all because _she has mastered it_.\r\nBecky Sharp is not a model. Her aims are unworthy, and her means\r\nunscrupulous; but she reads us a lesson in fact, in foresight, in\r\nenergy, in the subtle art of making the most of limited resources. So\r\nlong as life is a game, it is worth studying. The difference between\r\nplaying it well and playing it ill is the difference between light and\r\ndarkness, between joy and desolation, between life and death.\"\r\n\r\nEven at that early and immature time of his life, Willard Glazier had\r\nthought much upon this subject--examples of the disjointed successes of\r\nall unplanned and unmethodical careers having been brought too\r\nfrequently into close proximity to his own door, not to have made an\r\nimpression upon his inquiring mind.\r\n\r\nHence, at the very threshold of his life as a teacher, he resolved to\r\nhave plan and purpose clearly defined in everything he did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOLDIER SCHOOL-MASTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  From boy to man.--The Lyceum debate.--Willard speaks for the\r\n    slave.--Entrance to the State Normal School.--Reverses.--Fighting\r\n    the world again.--Assistance from fair hands.--Willard meets\r\n    Allen Barringer.--John Brown, and what Willard thought of\r\n    him.--Principles above bribe.--Examination.--A sleepless\r\n    night.--Haunted by the \"ghost of possible defeat.\"--\"Here is your\r\n    certificate.\"--The school at Schodack Centre.--At the \"Normal\"\r\n    again.--The Edwards School.--Thirty pupils at two dollars\r\n    each.--The \"soldier school-master.\"--Teaches at East\r\n    Schodack.--The runaway ride.--Good-by mittens, robes and\r\n    whip!--Close of school at East Schodack.\r\n\r\nAlthough a very boy in years, young Glazier felt himself already\r\nstepping upon the boundary line of manhood and, luckily for his future\r\nwelfare, comprehended the manifold dangers and mentally realized the\r\nresponsibilities which attend that phase of human existence.\r\n\r\nUpon the fifth of February, 1857, the dull routine of a teacher's duty\r\nwas varied by a visit made to Edwards by Willard's uncle Joseph, and his\r\nsisters; and, after closing his school, the former went home with his\r\nvisitors, and thence to a Lyceum which had been established in the\r\nHerrick School District, where a debate was in progress as to the\r\nrelative importance, in a humanitarian point of view, of the bondage of\r\nthe African race in the Southern States, or the decadence of the\r\nIndian tribes under the encroachments of the Whites. The \"question\"\r\nassumed that the Aborigines were most worthy of sympathy; and young\r\nGlazier, being invited to participate in the discussion, accepted, and\r\nspoke upon the negative side of the question.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gouverneur Wesleyan Seminary.]\r\n\r\nHe little dreamed upon that winter's night, when, in the small arena of\r\na village debating-club, he stood up as the champion of the slave, that\r\nthe day was not far distant when he would ride rowel-deep in carnage\r\nupon battle-fields which war's sad havoc had made sickening, fighting\r\nfor the same cause in whose behalf he now so eloquently spoke.\r\n\r\nNo prophetic vision of what fate held in store for him appeared to the\r\nardent boy, speaking for those who could not rise from the darkness of\r\ntheir bondage to speak for themselves. No glimpse of weary months\r\ndragged out in Confederate prisons--of hair-breadth escapes from dangers\r\ndread and manifold--of hiding in newly-dug graves made to assist the\r\nflight of the living, not to entomb the dead--of lying in jungles and\r\ncypress-swamps while fierce men and baffled hounds were panting for his\r\nblood--of vicissitudes and perils more like the wild creations of some\r\nfevered dream than the plain and unvarnished reality: nothing of all\r\nthis came before him to trouble his young hopes or cloud his bright\r\nanticipations of the future.\r\n\r\nHe spoke of freedom, and had never seen a slave. He pictured the cruelty\r\nof the lash used in a Christian land on Christian woman, be she black or\r\nwhite. He spoke of the deeper wrong of tearing the new-born babe from\r\nits mother's breast to sell it by the pound--of dragging the woman\r\nherself from the father of her child and compelling her to mate with\r\nother men--of the fact that such wrongs were not alone the offspring of\r\ncruel hearts, nor of brutal owners, but arose from the mere operation of\r\nbarbarous laws where masters, if left to themselves, would have been\r\nmost kind. He spoke of such things as these, and yet he never dreamed\r\nthat his words were but the precursors of deeds that would make mere\r\nwords seem spiritless and tame.\r\n\r\nYoung Glazier spoke well. The little magnates of the place,--the older\r\nmen, after this, talked of him as of one likely to rise, to become a man\r\nof note, and their manner grew more respectful towards the young\r\nschool-master. His occupations and amusements at this period of his\r\nexistence, though simple in their character, were considerably varied.\r\n\r\nAmong other entries in his journal about this date, is one that so\r\ncommends itself by its brevity and comprehensiveness that I quote it\r\n_verbatim_.\r\n\r\n\"Having,\" he says, \"received an invitation upon the twenty-fourth of\r\nDecember, I attended a party at the residence of Jeptha Clark, whose\r\nexcellent wife received me very kindly; upon Christmas day I visited T.\r\nL. Turnbull's school at Fullerville; upon Monday last called at Mr.\r\nAustin's school in the Herrick District; Tuesday, dropped down for a\r\nmoment upon the students at Gouverneur; on Wednesday, returned home; and\r\non Thursday, for the greater part of the day, assisted uncle Joseph in\r\nhauling wood from the swamps on the Davis Place.\"\r\n\r\nThus the time slipped rapidly by and his first term of teaching drew to\r\na close. In the spring of 1859 he again became a member of the\r\nGouverneur Wesleyan Seminary, and in May of that year, made the\r\nfollowing characteristic entry in his diary:\r\n\r\n\"'Order is Heaven's first law.' A time and place for everything, and\r\neverything in its time and place, was the rule of conduct I adopted some\r\ntime ago. In accordance with this determination I have laid out the\r\nfollowing routine of occupation for each day. I intend to abide by it\r\nduring the present term. I will retire at ten o'clock P. M., rise each\r\nmorning at five o'clock, walk and exercise until six, then return to my\r\nroom, breakfast and read history until eight, then repeat what the\r\nEnglish call a 'constitutional,' viz.: another walk until prayers,\r\ndevoting the time intervening between prayers and recitation, to\r\nAlgebra. After recitation, I will study Geometry for three-quarters of\r\nan hour, Latin for half an hour, and be ready for recitation again at\r\ntwo o'clock. This will complete my regular course of study, and, by\r\ncarrying out this routine, I can dine at noon, and also have a\r\nconsiderable amount of time for miscellaneous reading and writing, to\r\nsay nothing of my Saturdays, upon which I can review the studies of the\r\nweek.\"\r\n\r\nTo this plan young Glazier adhered conscientiously, and hence made rapid\r\nprogress and very soon found himself in a condition to take another\r\nforward step in the pathway of learning. That step was the entrance to\r\nthe State Normal School at Albany. To go to West Point and receive the\r\nmilitary training which our government benevolently bestows upon her\r\nsons at that institution, had been his pet ambition for years--the\r\nscheme towards which all his energies were bent. But failing in this,\r\nhis next choice was the Normal School. Accordingly, on a certain\r\nSeptember afternoon in 1859, he found himself in the capital city of the\r\nEmpire State, knocking for admission at the doors of the Normal School.\r\nHe was alone and among strangers in a great city, with a purse\r\ncontaining the sum of eight dollars! For a course of seven or eight\r\nmonths instruction this was certainly a modest estimate of expenses! In\r\nfact, young Glazier had based his financial arrangements on a\r\nmiscalculation of the amount furnished by the State. He did not then\r\nknow that the only provision made by the body politic was for mileage,\r\ntuition and text-books. But on Monday morning, September seventeenth,\r\n1859, he signed his name to the Normal pledge, and at the conclusion of\r\nthe examination--which continued until September twenty-third--was\r\nassigned to the Junior Class--there being at that time four classes: the\r\nSenior and sub-Senior, Junior and sub-Junior.\r\n\r\nThe next step was to find lodgings at a weekly or monthly price more\r\nsuited to his means than those which he had temporarily taken at the\r\nAdams House on his arrival there the previous evening. Always frugal in\r\nregard to his personal expenditures, he knew that, in order to eke out\r\nthe full term with his scanty resources, he must carry his habitual\r\nthrift to its fullest extent. He therefore scoured the town for\r\napartments, aided by references from Professor Cochran, principal of the\r\nNormal, and finally obtained a room on Lydius street, almost within\r\nshadow of the Cathedral, and at the certainly reasonable rate of \"six\r\nshillings per week.\" This room he shared with Alexander S. Hunter, from\r\nSchoharie County, and a member of the sub-Senior Class. For several\r\nweeks the young students boarded at this place, buying what food they\r\nrequired, which the landlady cooked for them free of charge.\r\nSeventy-five cents a week paid for their cooking and rent!\r\n\r\nBut even this small outlay soon exhausted the meagre resources of young\r\nGlazier and, at the end of the time mentioned, he went over into\r\nRensselaer County, to look up a school, in order to replenish his\r\nwell-nigh empty purse, and to enable him to continue in his efforts to\r\nacquire an education. It was a bright clear morning in November when he\r\nleft his boarding-place on Lydius street in quest of his self-appointed\r\nwork, and, crossing the Hudson on a ferry-boat, walked all the way to\r\nNassau by the Bloomingdale Road--a distance of sixteen miles. His object\r\nwas to find Allen Barringer, School Commissioner for Rensselaer County,\r\nwho, as he had been told, lived somewhere near Nassau. On the way to\r\nthat village he passed two or three schools, concerning which he made\r\ninquiries, with a view to engaging some one of them on his return to\r\nAlbany should he be so successful as to obtain a certificate from Mr.\r\nBarringer. At about two o'clock in the afternoon of this, to him,\r\neventful day, young Glazier had arrived at the residence of Harmon\r\nPayne, near East Schodack, or \"Scott's Corners,\" as it was sometimes\r\ncalled. He had been referred to this gentleman as one likely to assist\r\nhim in his endeavors to obtain a school. He had eaten nothing since\r\nmorning, and, having walked a distance of nearly sixteen miles, as may\r\nbe imagined, was somewhat faint and hungry. But the good wife of Mr.\r\nPayne showed herself not lacking in the kindly courtesy belonging to a\r\ngentlewoman, and, with true hospitality, placed before the young Normal\r\nstudent a delicious repast of bread and honey.\r\n\r\nTo this youthful wayfarer, with a purse reduced to a cypher, and\r\nstruggling over the first rough places in the pathway of life, the\r\nsimple meal was like manna in the wilderness. After chatting pleasantly\r\nwith the family for an hour or more, he started again on his journey.\r\nBut this time not alone; for Mr. Payne very kindly sent his niece with\r\nthe boy teacher, in whom he had become so much interested, to show him a\r\nshorter route \"across lots\" to East Schodack. This village, two miles\r\nfarther on, by the traveled highway, was only three-quarters of a mile\r\ndistant by a pathway leading across the pasture lands of some adjoining\r\nfarms. In the fading November afternoon the young lady and her _protege_\r\nwalked together to East Schodack--a walk which young Willard never\r\nforgot, and out of which afterwards grew a fairy fabric of romantic\r\nregard glittering with all the rainbow hues of boyish sentiment, and\r\nfalling collapsed in the after-crash of life, like many another\r\nsoap-bubble experience of first young days.\r\n\r\nBut he did not succeed, at that time, in securing the East Schodack\r\nSchool, as he had hoped to do. Nothing daunted, however, he trod\r\nreverses under foot and pushed on towards the residence of the School\r\nCommissioner whose _ipse dixit_ was to award him success or failure.\r\n\r\nAllen Barringer lived one mile from the village of Nassau, in Rensselaer\r\nCounty, and it was nearly nightfall when, with an anxious heart and\r\nweary with the day's journey, he knocked at the door of the comfortable\r\ncountry residence which had been pointed out to him as the one\r\nbelonging to the School Commissioner. That gentleman himself came to the\r\ndoor in answer to his knock, and upon Willard's inquiry for Mr.\r\nBarringer replied:\r\n\r\n\"I am Mr. Barringer, sir; what can I do for you?\"\r\n\r\nHis manner was so pleasant and his face so genial that young Glazier, at\r\nonce reassured, had no difficulty in making known his business.\r\n\r\n\"I have come out here from Albany,\" said he, \"to see if I could pass\r\nexamination for a certificate, to teach in your district.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, come in, come in,\" said Mr. Barringer, cordially, \"and I will see\r\nwhat I can do for you. You are not going back to Albany to-night?\" he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\"No, I shall not be able to do so,\" replied Willard.\r\n\r\n\"Have you friends or relatives here with whom you intend to stay?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I shall be glad to have you stop with us to-night. I am a young\r\nman like yourself, living at home here with my parents, as you see; I am\r\nfond of company, and will be happy to place my room at your disposal.\r\nAnd as there will be no hurry about the examination, we will talk more\r\nabout it after supper.\"\r\n\r\nYoung Glazier thanked his host for the kind proffer of entertainment,\r\nand of course acquiesced in the arrangement.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, after the physical man had been refreshed at a well-spread\r\nsupper-table, Mr. Barringer conducted his young guest to his own\r\napartments, where they drew their easy-chairs before a comfortable fire,\r\nand entered into conversation.\r\n\r\n\"I am considerably interested in politics just now,\" said Mr. Barringer,\r\nand then he asked abruptly, \"what is your opinion of John Brown?\"\r\n\r\nAt this time the first red flash of the war that swiftly followed, had\r\nglowered athwart the political horizon, in the John Brown raid at\r\nHarper's Ferry, and against this lurid background the figure of the\r\nstern old man stood out in strong relief. It was at the period when,\r\nshut up in prison, he was writing those heroic words to his wife, those\r\nloving words of farewell to his children; when petitions poured in\r\npleading for his life--though they were petitions all in vain--and when,\r\nnaturally, partisan feeling on the subject was at its height. Willard\r\nfelt that in expressing his candid convictions he might be treading on\r\ndangerous ground, and perhaps endangering his chances for success, yet\r\nhe held principle so high, and honest sentiment so far above bribe, that\r\nif his certificate had depended on it he would not have hesitated to\r\nexpress his admiration for the brave old man who laid down his life for\r\nthe slave, and whose name has since been crowned with the immortelles of\r\nfame. Therefore Willard replied with a frankness worthy of emulation\r\nthat he looked upon John Brown as a conscientious, earnest, devoted\r\nman--a man whose face was firmly set in the path of duty though that\r\npath led to imprisonment and the gallows; a man much in advance of his\r\ntime--one of the pioneers of free thought, suffering for the sacred\r\ncause, as pioneers in all great movements always suffer. He spoke with a\r\nmodest fearlessness known sometimes to youth and to few men. Mr.\r\nBarringer replied that, though he held different views, he could not but\r\nadmire Willard's frankness in avowing his own political convictions,\r\nand that this independence in principle would in nowise detract from his\r\npreviously formed good opinion of him. Afterwards, Mr. Barringer\r\nexamined him in the common English branches of study, besides astronomy,\r\nphilosophy and algebra--studies usually taught in the public schools of\r\nRensselaer County. In this way, with much pleasant talk dropped at\r\nintervals through the official business of examination, interspersed\r\nwith politics and concluded with social chat, an agreeable evening\r\npassed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Old State Normal School. Albany, New York.]\r\n\r\nMr. Barringer at last said good-night to the young Normal student, with\r\nthe remark that he would see what could be done for him in the morning.\r\n\r\nNot much sleep visited Willard's eyes that night, with the ghost of\r\npossible defeat haunting his wakeful senses, stretched to their utmost\r\ntension of anxiety.\r\n\r\nWould he, or would he not, receive in the morning the certificate he\r\nsought? This was the thought tossed continually up on the topmost wave\r\nof his consciousness all the night long. Morning dawned at last, much to\r\nhis relief. When Mr. Barringer came to his door to announce breakfast,\r\nhe handed Willard the coveted piece of paper.\r\n\r\n\"Now then,\" said he, cheerily, \"here is your certificate, and as I am\r\ngoing to drive over to Albany after breakfast, if you have no particular\r\nschool in view, I shall be glad to have you ride with me as far as\r\nSchodack Centre, where I have some very good friends, and will introduce\r\nyou to the trustees of the district, Messrs. Brockway, Hover and\r\nKnickerbocker.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly they drove over to the residence of Milton Knickerbocker,\r\nschool trustee of District No. 7, of the town of Schodack.\r\n\r\nThat gentleman thanked the School Commissioner for bringing the young\r\nteacher over, said that he would be pleased to engage him, and that it\r\nwas only necessary to see another trustee, George Brockway, to make the\r\nengagement final. Mr. Knickerbocker then accompanied young Glazier to\r\nthe residence of Mr. Brockway, where arrangements were made for him to\r\nteach the school at Schodack Centre. He then walked back to Albany.\r\n\r\nWillard had said nothing to his landlady, on Lydius street, concerning\r\nhis intended absence, fearing he might have to report the failure of his\r\nproject, and on the evening of his return to Albany--having been away\r\nfor thirty-six hours--was surprised to find that the family were just\r\nabout to advertise him in the city papers, thinking some strange fate\r\nhad befallen him,--that he had perhaps committed suicide.\r\n\r\nIn just one week from the time Glazier engaged his school at Schodack\r\nCentre, he returned to that place, and taught the young Schodackers\r\nsuccessfully through the specified term, after which he went to Albany\r\nand passed the next Normal School term. On the twelfth of July\r\nfollowing, he left Albany for the home farm, where he worked until the\r\nfirst of September. He then went on a prospecting tour out to Edwards,\r\nnear the field of his former efforts, and canvassed for scholars at two\r\ndollars each, for a term of eight weeks. His object was to teach during\r\nthe fall and winter months and return to Albany in the spring. This\r\nenergetic youth of eighteen succeeded in obtaining about thirty pupils,\r\namong whom were six teachers--one of them having taught four terms.\r\n\r\nAmong the incidents of his school experience at this time may be\r\nmentioned the fact of a series of drill tactics, originated by himself,\r\nwith which he practised his pupils so thoroughly that they were enabled\r\nto go through all the regular evolutions set down in Hardee. Yet he had\r\nnever seen the drill-book.\r\n\r\nIt may be regarded as one of those outcroppings of his natural bent\r\ntowards the military art which he displayed from his very infancy; for\r\ntrue military genius, like true poetical genius, is born, not made. Of\r\ncourse our young tactician soon made himself known, and throughout the\r\ndistrict he was distinguished by the title of the \"Soldier-Schoolmaster.\"\r\n\r\nIt was an involuntary tribute yielded by public sentiment to the boy who\r\nafterwards became the \"Soldier-Author.\"\r\n\r\nThis boy-teacher, young as he was, marshaled all his pupils into\r\ndisciplined order, like the rank and file of the army, and somehow held\r\nnatural words of command at his disposal whereby he wielded the human\r\nmaterial given into his charge, as a general might wield the forces\r\nunder his command. The school was his miniature world and he was its\r\nmaster--his diminutive kingdom wherein he was king; and within the\r\nboundary of this chosen realm his sway was absolute.\r\n\r\nFirst the \"Soldier-Schoolmaster,\" drilling his boy-pupils; then the\r\nSoldier of the Saddle, riding through shot and shell and war's fierce\r\ndin on Virginia's historic fields; and last, but perhaps not least, the\r\n\"Soldier-Author,\" winning golden opinions from press and people; through\r\nall these changes of his life, from boy to man, one characteristic shows\r\nplain and clear--his military bent. It is like the one bright stripe\r\nthrough a neutral ground, the one vein of ore deposit through the\r\nvarious stratifications of its native rock.\r\n\r\nThe Edwards Select School was continued until the first of November,\r\nwhen Glazier left home once more, this time in company with his sister\r\nMarjorie, bound for Troy. On arriving at that city he left his sister at\r\nthe house of an old friend, Alexander McCoy, and went down into\r\nRensselaer County a second time in search of a school, or rather two\r\nschools--one for his sister as well as one for himself. He succeeded in\r\nobtaining both of them on the same day, and went back to Troy that\r\nnight. His own district was East Schodack, near Schodack Centre, where\r\nhe had previously taught, and his sister secured the school two miles\r\nnorth of the village of Castleton and six miles distant from Albany.\r\n\r\nThe little school-house near Castleton, where his sister taught, was\r\nlocated in a lovely spot on a height overlooking the Hudson and\r\ncommanding a fine view of the river and the surrounding scenery.\r\n\r\nDuring the school term in their respective districts, it was Willard\r\nGlazier's habit to visit his sister once a week, on Saturday or Sunday,\r\nand on several occasions a gentleman living at East Schodack, William\r\nWestfall by name, who owned a fine horse and sleigh, loaned him the use\r\nof his conveyance to drive to Castleton and return. The sleigh was\r\nprovided with warm robes of fur and the horse was beyond doubt spirited,\r\nand a handsome specimen of the genus horse. But as we cannot look for\r\nabsolute perfection in anything pertaining to earth, it may be stated\r\nthat this animal was no exception to the universal rule. He had his\r\nfault, as young Glazier discovered--a disagreeable habit of running\r\naway every time he saw a train of cars. Perhaps the horse couldn't help\r\nit; it was no doubt an inherited disposition, descended to him through\r\nlong lines of fractious ancestors, and therefore it need not be set down\r\nagainst him in the catalogue of wilful sins. But whether so or\r\notherwise, this little unpleasantness in his disposition was an\r\nestablished fact, and unfortunately there were two railroads to cross\r\nbetween East Schodack and Castleton. On Glazier's first ride to\r\nCastleton with the Westfall horse and sleigh, he had just crossed the\r\nBoston and Albany Railroad when a freight-train rolled heavily by, which\r\nput the horse under excellent headway, and on reaching the Hudson River\r\nRailroad--the two tracks running very near each other--a passenger train\r\ncame up behind him. This completed the aggregation of causes, and away\r\nflew the horse down the road to Castleton at break-neck speed. Fences\r\ndisappeared like gray streaks in the distance; roadside cottages came in\r\nview and were swiftly left behind in the track of the foam-flecked\r\nanimal. All that Glazier could do was to keep him in the road, until at\r\nlength an old shed by the roadside served his purpose, and running him\r\ninto it, the horse, puffing and snorting, was obliged to stop. On his\r\nreturn to East Schodack, Mr. Westfall asked him how he liked the horse.\r\nHe replied that he thought the animal a splendid traveler. He _did_\r\nthink so, beyond question.\r\n\r\nThe next Sunday young Glazier was driving again to Castleton with the\r\nsame stylish turn-out; this time with his sister Marjorie in the sleigh.\r\nShe had come up to East Schodack the evening before, and he was taking\r\nher back to her school. The sleighing was excellent, the day fine, and\r\nall went merry as a marriage bell until they reached the railroad. There\r\nthe inevitable train of cars loomed in view, and the puff, puff of the\r\nengine, sending out great volumes of steam and its wild screech at the\r\ncrossing, completely upset what few ideas of propriety and steady travel\r\nthis horse may have had in his poor, bewildered head, and, with a leap\r\nand a jerk, he was once more running away on the Castleton Road as if\r\nthe entire host of the nether regions were let loose after him.\r\n\r\nFor a little while he made things around them as lively as a pot of\r\nyeast. Away went whip, robes, mittens and everything else lying loose in\r\nthe bottom of the sleigh at all calculated to yield to the velocity of a\r\nwhirlwind or a runaway. But Glazier proved himself master of the\r\nsituation in this as in many another event of his life, and with one\r\nhand holding his frightened sister from jumping out of the sleigh, with\r\nthe other he twisted the lines firmly around his wrist and kept the\r\nhorse in the road, until, at the distance of three-quarters of a mile\r\nbeyond Castleton, he brought the infuriated animal to a stand-still by\r\nrunning him against the side of a barn. Afterwards he drove leisurely\r\nback and picked up the robes, and whip and articles spilled during the\r\nwild runaway ride.\r\n\r\nA broken shaft was the only result of this last adventure, which Glazier\r\nof course, put in repair before his return to East Schodack. Mr.\r\nWestfall never knew until after the close of the school term that his\r\nhorse had afforded the young teacher an opportunity to tell what he knew\r\nabout runaways.\r\n\r\nThe school at East Schodack closed with an exhibition exceedingly\r\ncreditable to the efforts of the teacher, at which Mr. Allen Barringer\r\nwas present, and in a speech before the school complimented young\r\nGlazier in the highest terms. The programme of exercises was an\r\nexcellent one, and was made up of original addresses, declamations,\r\nrecitations and music. After the close of the school, Mr. Barringer\r\npresented Glazier with a certificate which entitled him to teach for\r\nthree years, and also gave him in addition the following letter of\r\nrecommendation--a tribute of which any young teacher might be justly\r\nproud, and which he carefully preserved:\r\n\r\n     \"To Whom it May Concern:\r\n\r\n     \"This is to certify, that I am well acquainted with Willard\r\n     Glazier, he having taught school during the winters of 1859 and '60\r\n     in my Commission District. I consider him one of the most promising\r\n     young teachers of my acquaintance. The school that has the good\r\n     fortune to secure his services will find him one of the most\r\n     capable and efficient teachers of the day.\r\n\r\n                                                  \"Allen Barringer,\r\n\r\n                               \"School Commissioner, Rensselaer County.\r\n\r\n      \"Schodack, New York, 1860.\"\r\n\r\nEarly in the year 1860 he resumed his studies at the State Normal\r\nSchool, and remained at that institution until the guns of Sumter\r\nsounded their war-cry through the land.\r\n\r\nThis period was the great turning-point in Willard Glazier's life, and\r\nhereafter we encounter him in a far different _role_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION TO MILITARY LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The mutterings of war.--Enlistment.--At Camp Howe.--First\r\n    experience as a soldier.--\"One step to the front!\"--Beyond\r\n    Washington.--On guard.--Promotion.--Recruiting service.--The\r\n    deserted home on Arlington Heights.--\"How shall I behave in the\r\n    coming battle?\"--The brave Bayard.--On the march.--The stratagem\r\n    at Falmouth Heights.--A brilliant charge.--After the battle.\r\n\r\nThe inevitable results of the discord so long pending between North and\r\nSouth accumulated day by day; and when, at length, Abraham Lincoln was\r\nelected by a large popular majority, that election was, as everybody\r\nknows, immediately followed by the calling of a Southern States\r\nConvention, the secession, one after another, of each of those States,\r\nthe capture of Fort Sumter, the killing of Ellsworth, and the defeat of\r\nthe Federal troops at Bull Run. All of these occurrences contributed to\r\ninflame the passions, intensify the opinions, and arouse the enthusiasm\r\nof the people of both sections to fever-heat.\r\n\r\nIt was in the whirl and torrent of this popular storm that Willard\r\nGlazier was caught up and swept into the ranks of the Union army.\r\n\r\nHis regiment, the Harris Light Cavalry, was originally intended for the\r\nregular service--to rank as the Seventh Regular Cavalry. The general\r\ngovernment, however, concluded to limit the number of their regiments of\r\nhorse to six--the reasons for which are given by Captain Glazier in\r\nhis \"Soldiers of the Saddle,\" as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Under the military _regime_ of General Scott, the cavalry arm of the\r\nservice had been almost entirely overlooked. His previous campaigns in\r\nMexico, which consisted chiefly of the investment of walled towns and of\r\nassaults on fortresses, had not been favorable to extensive cavalry\r\noperations, and he was not disposed, at so advanced an age in life,\r\nmaterially to change his tactics of war.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Cavalry Column On The March.]\r\n\r\nHence, this regiment was mustered into service as the \"Second Regiment\r\nof New York Cavalry,\" and, as Senator Ira Harris had extended to the\r\norganization the influence of his name and purse, it soon came to be\r\ncalled the \"Harris Light Cavalry,\" and retained that title throughout\r\nthe whole of its eventful career. The natural tastes of young Glazier\r\nled him into this branch of the service in preference to the infantry,\r\nand we find him writing to his sister Marjorie as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    Camp Howe, near Scarsdale, New York,\r\n                                            _August 16th, 1861_.\r\n\r\n     My Dear Sister: From the post-mark of this letter you will at once\r\n     conjecture the truth ere I tell it to you, and I can fancy you\r\n     saying to yourself when you glance at it: \"Willard is no longer\r\n     talking about enlisting but has really entered the army.\" You are\r\n     right, I now wear the Union Blue.\r\n\r\n     Many of our home friends will doubtless wonder why I have\r\n     sacrificed my professional prospects at a time when they first\r\n     began to look cheering, in order to share the hardships and perils\r\n     of a soldier's life. But I need not explain, to _you_, my reasons\r\n     for doing so. When our country is threatened with destruction by\r\n     base and designing men, in order to gratify personal ambition and\r\n     love of sway, it becomes her sons to go to her rescue and avert the\r\n     impending ruin. The rebelling South has yet to learn the difference\r\n     between the _true principles_ of the Constitution and the\r\n     _delusion_ of \"State rights.\" It is as easy to die a volunteer as a\r\n     drafted soldier, and in my opinion, is infinitely more honorable.\r\n     I shall return to my studies as soon as the Rebellion is put down\r\n     and the authority of our Government fully restored, and not _until_\r\n     then.\r\n\r\n     Let me give you a sketch of our movements thus far. Having reached\r\n     Troy at 3 o'clock on the afternoon of the day you and I parted, I\r\n     spent the remainder of the evening until 8 o'clock in the city. At\r\n     that hour we embarked for New York, and the boys had a very\r\n     exciting and enthusiastic time on board the steamer Vanderbilt.\r\n     Wednesday was spent at 648 Broadway, Regimental Headquarters of the\r\n     \"Harris Light Cavalry;\" and on that night we came by train to our\r\n     present camp: or, rather, as near it as we could, for it is two\r\n     miles from the nearest station. The spot is picturesque enough to\r\n     be described. An old farm, surrounded by stone fences that look\r\n     like ramparts, constitutes the camp. The Hudson and Harlem rivers\r\n     are in full view, and the country around is full of beauty. On the\r\n     first night we _bivouacked_ upon the bare sod, with no covering for\r\n     our bodies but the broad canopy of heaven. It was not until a late\r\n     hour on the following afternoon that our white tents began to dot\r\n     the ground and gleam through the dark foliage of the trees.\r\n\r\n     Crowds of visitors from the neighboring village come out every day\r\n     to see us. My health was never better, and this sort of life\r\n     affords me keen enjoyment. The very roughness of it is\r\n     invigorating. My present writing-desk is the top of the stone wall\r\n     I have alluded to, so you must criticise neither my penmanship nor\r\n     my style. I received a letter from father on Tuesday afternoon,\r\n     and, thank God! I enter the service with his full approbation. The\r\n     discipline enforced here is strict, our rations are good, fruit is\r\n     very abundant, and to be had for the asking; so that if you will\r\n     only write soon and often, there will be little else required to\r\n     fill the wants of\r\n\r\n     Your affectionate brother, Willard.\r\n\r\n\r\nFortunately for their future comfort, the Harris Light Cavalry, at the\r\nvery outset of its military career, was placed under the charge of a\r\nrigid and skilful disciplinarian--one Captain A. N. Duffie--who, having\r\ngraduated honorably at the celebrated French military school, St. Cyr,\r\npossessed all the martial enthusiasm as well as personal peculiarities\r\nof his excitable countrymen.\r\n\r\nThe captain either was, or believed himself to be, an eloquent speaker,\r\nand his efforts at rhetorical display, added to his French pronunciation\r\nof English words, became a source of great amusement to the men. He was\r\nwont to harangue them, as if they were about to enter upon a sanguinary\r\nbattle. The old stone walls of the peaceful farm were pictured as\r\nbristling with the enemy's bayonets, and the boys were called on to\r\n\"charge\" at the hidden foe and capture him.\r\n\r\n\"One morning,\" says Captain Glazier, \"after a week spent in drill, we\r\nwere all surprised by receiving an order to 'fall into line,' and\r\ndiscovered that the object of this movement was to listen to a\r\nNapoleonic harangue from Captain Duffie. So loud had been our protests,\r\nso manifest our rebellious spirit on the subject of fortifying a\r\npeaceful farm on the banks of the Hudson, that the captain undoubtedly\r\nfeared he might not be very zealously supported by us in his future\r\nmovements, and, like Napoleon on assuming command of the Army of Italy,\r\nsought to test the devotion of his men. After amusing us a-while in\r\nbroken English, appealing to our patriotism and honor, he at length\r\nshouted:\r\n\r\n\"'Now, as many of you as are ready to follow me to the cannon's mouth,\r\ntake one step to the front!'\r\n\r\n\"This _ruse_ was perfectly successful, and the whole line took the\r\ndesired step.\"\r\n\r\nThe time passed pleasantly enough in this camp of instruction, despite\r\nthe monotony of drill and guard duty, and, by the time the order to\r\nbreak camp reached the men, they were well advanced in the duties of the\r\nsoldier.\r\n\r\nThe regiment left Camp Howe about the end of August, and, passing\r\nthrough New York, entered that most beautiful and patriotic of cities,\r\nPhiladelphia, where they were royally entertained by the managers of the\r\n\"Volunteer Refreshment Saloon.\" They at length reached Washington and\r\nencamped a half mile beyond the Capitol.\r\n\r\nFrom this point Glazier writes to his mother as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                         Camp Oregon,\r\n                                                  Near Washington, D.C.,\r\n                                                 _August 25th, 1861_.\r\n\r\n     Dear Mother: I am at present seated under the branches of a large\r\n     peach tree that marks the spot where two sentinels of our army,\r\n     while on duty last night, were shot by the rebels. I was one of the\r\n     same guard, having been assigned to such duty for the first time\r\n     since entering the service. Like all other sentinels, I was obliged\r\n     to walk my lonely beat with drawn sabre.\r\n\r\n     It may interest you to know where I performed my first guard duty.\r\n     It was in front of the residence of a rabid secessionist, who is\r\n     now an officer in the famous Black-Horse Cavalry. You may remember\r\n     that this regiment was reported to have been utterly destroyed at\r\n     Bull Run, and yet I am informed by Washingtonians that it had but\r\n     two companies in the fight. So much for newspaper gossip.\r\n\r\n     During the day I was very kindly treated by the family of this\r\n     gentleman, but in the evening our camp commander came to me and\r\n     said: \"Take this revolver, and if you value your life, be vigilant.\r\n     _Remember, you are not at Scarsdale now!_\" He, of course, referred\r\n     to our old camp near Scarsdale, twenty-four miles from New York.\r\n     Our present one is a little over half a mile from the Capitol, and\r\n     from my tent I can see the dome of that building, glittering, like\r\n     a ball of gold, in the sunlight.\r\n\r\n     Yesterday I paid a visit to the city. The streets were crowded with\r\n     infantry, artillery and cavalry soldiers, all actively engaged in\r\n     preparing for the coming conflict. An engagement seems to be close\r\n     at hand. Entrenchments are being dug and batteries erected in every\r\n     direction. The citizens do not apprehend any danger from an attack\r\n     by the enemy.\r\n\r\n     My regiment has been attached to Brigadier-General Baker's\r\n     Brigade. It will be three weeks to-morrow since I enlisted. I have\r\n     been in this camp one week, and one week was spent at Camp Howe,\r\n     Scarsdale, New York.\r\n\r\n     We are being rapidly prepared for field service. Our drill is very\r\n     rigid, yet I submit to the discipline willingly, and I find that\r\n     hard study is as essential to the composition of a good soldier as\r\n     to a good teacher. I have purchased a copy of the \"Cavalry\r\n     Tactics,\" and devote every leisure hour to its mastery. There is\r\n     but one thing which gives me any serious annoyance now, and that is\r\n     the question of the ways and means for the education of my brothers\r\n     and sisters. I think Elvira and Marjorie had better teach this\r\n     winter, and then, if the war should be concluded before next\r\n     spring, I will make arrangements for their attendance at school\r\n     again. With kindest love to all, I am\r\n\r\n                       Your loving and dutiful son,\r\n\r\n                                                              Willard.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout two months more were occupied by the Harris Light in camp-duty,\r\nscouting and foraging, but almost immediately after their arrival in\r\nVirginia, young Glazier was promoted to the rank of Corporal. Shortly\r\nafter his promotion he was detailed for recruiting service and sent to\r\nthe city of New York for that purpose. The great city was in a turmoil\r\nof excitement.\r\n\r\nThe \"Tammany\" organization carried things with a high hand, and was\r\nopposed by the equally powerful Union League. Between these two centres\r\nthe current of public opinion ran in strong tides. But, in the midst of\r\nit all, the young corporal was successful in his recruiting service, and\r\non the second day of December rejoined his comrades, who were then at\r\nCamp Palmer, Arlington Heights.\r\n\r\nThis spot was one of peculiar beauty. Its associations were hallowed.\r\nThere stood the ancestral home of the Lees, whose deserted rooms seemed\r\nhaunted with memories of a noble race. Its floors had echoed to the\r\ntread of youth and beauty. Its walls had witnessed gatherings of renown.\r\nFrom its portals rode General Lee to take command of the Richmond\r\ntroops--a man who must be revered for his qualities of heart and\r\nremembered especially by the North as one who, amid all the fury of\r\npassion which the war engendered, was never betrayed into an intemperate\r\nexpression towards the enemy. _Now_, the halls and porches of the quaint\r\nold building rang with the tread of armed men. Its rooms were despoiled,\r\nand that atmosphere of desolation which ever clings about a deserted\r\nhome, enveloped the place. A winding roadway under thick foliaged trees,\r\nled down the Heights to the \"Long Bridge,\" crossing the Potomac. Near\r\nthe house stood an old-fashioned \"well sweep\" which carried a\r\nmoss-covered bucket on its trips down the well, to bring up the most\r\nsparkling of water. Instinctively a feeling of sadness took possession\r\nof the heart at the mournful contrast between the past and present of\r\nthis beautiful spot.\r\n\r\n    \"Ah, crueler than fire or flood\r\n    Come steps of men of alien blood,\r\n    And silently the treacherous air\r\n    Closes--and keeps no token, where\r\n    Its dead are buried.\"\r\n\r\nThe day of trial--the baptism of battle--seemed rapidly approaching.\r\nGeneral McClellan, having drilled and manoeuvred and viewed and reviewed\r\nthe Army of the Potomac, until what had been little better than an armed\r\nand uniformed mob began to assume the aspect of a body of regulars,\r\ndetermined upon an advance movement. Accordingly on the third of March,\r\n1862, the army marched upon Centreville, captured the \"Quaker\" guns\r\nand, much to the disgust of his followers, fell back upon his original\r\nposition, instead of continuing the advance.\r\n\r\nAs the Harris Light enjoyed throughout this campaign of magnificent\r\npossibilities, the honor of being \"Little Mac's\" body guard, they were\r\nof course during the forward movement in high spirits. They believed it\r\nto be the initial step to a vigorous campaign in which they might hold\r\nthe post of honor. But when the order to fall back came, their\r\ndisappointment was great indeed. At first they were mystified, but it\r\nsoon leaked out that a council of war had been held and that McClellan's\r\nplan of the Peninsular Campaign had been adopted.\r\n\r\nIt had also been determined that a section of the army should be left\r\nbehind, under the command of General Irvin McDowell, to guard the\r\napproaches to Washington.\r\n\r\nThe First Pennsylvania Cavalry, under the command of General (then\r\nColonel) George Dashiel Bayard, and the Harris Light, remained with the\r\nlatter force. Under such a leader as Bayard, the men could have no fear\r\nof rusting in inactivity. He was the soul of honor, the bravest of the\r\nbrave. No more gallant spirit ever took up the sword, no kinder heart\r\never tempered valor, no life was more stainless, no death could be more\r\nsad; for the day that was appointed for his nuptials closed over his\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\nJudson Kilpatrick, one of those restless, nervous, energetic and\r\nself-reliant spirits who believe in themselves thoroughly, and make up\r\nin activity what they lack in method, was Colonel of the Harris Light,\r\nand the dawning glory of young Bayard's fame excited a spirit of\r\nemulation, if not of envy in his heart, which found vent in a very\r\ncreditable desire to equal or excel that leader in the field. The\r\nbrilliant night attack on Falmouth Heights was one of the first results\r\nof this rivalry, and as it was also the initial battle in Corporal\r\nGlazier's experience, we give his own vivid description of it as it is\r\nfound in \"Three Years in the Federal Cavalry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our instructions,\" he says, \"were conveyed to us in a whisper. A\r\nbeautiful moonlight fell upon the scene, which was as still as death;\r\nand with proud determination the two young cavalry chieftains moved\r\nforward to the night's fray. Bayard was to attack on the main road in\r\nfront, but not until Kilpatrick had commenced operations on their right\r\nflank, by a detour through a narrow and neglected wood-path. As the\r\nHeights were considered well-nigh impregnable, it was necessary to\r\nresort to some stratagem, for which Kilpatrick showed a becoming\r\naptness.\r\n\r\n\"Having approached to within hearing distance of the rebel pickets, but\r\nbefore we were challenged, Kilpatrick shouted with his clear voice,\r\nwhich sounded like a trumpet on the still night air:\r\n\r\n\"'Bring up your artillery in the centre, and infantry on the left!'\r\n\r\n\"'Well, but, Colonel,' said an honest though rather obtuse Captain, 'we\r\nhaven't got any inf--'\r\n\r\n\"'Silence in the ranks!' commanded the leader. 'Artillery in the centre,\r\ninfantry on the left!'\r\n\r\n\"The pickets caught and spread the alarm and thus greatly facilitated\r\nour hazardous enterprise.\r\n\r\n\"'Charge!' was the order which then thrilled the ranks, and echoed\r\nthrough the dark, dismal woods; and the column swept up the rugged\r\nheights in the midst of blazing cannon and rattling musketry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Night Attack On Falmouth Heights.]\r\n\r\n\"So steep was the ascent that not a few saddles slipped off the horses,\r\nprecipitating their riders into a creek which flowed lazily at the base\r\nof a hill; while others fell dead and dying, struck by the missiles of\r\ndestruction which filled the air. But the field was won, and the enemy,\r\ndriven at the point of the sabre, fled unceremoniously down the heights,\r\nthrough Falmouth and over the bridge which spanned the Rappahannock,\r\nburning that beautiful structure behind them, to prevent pursuit.\"\r\n\r\nThis engagement, while otherwise of but little importance, was valuable\r\nbecause it taught the enemy that the Federals could use the cavalry arm\r\nof the service as effectively as their infantry.\r\n\r\nAll accounts agree that Corporal Glazier acquitted himself very\r\ncreditably in his first battle. After the action was over he accompanied\r\nhis comrades to the field and contributed his best aid towards the care\r\nof the wounded and the unburied dead. Such an experience was full of\r\npainful contrast to the quiet scenes of home and school life to which he\r\nhad hitherto been accustomed. In his history, as with thousands of other\r\nbrave boys who missed death through many battles, this period was the\r\nsharp prelude to a long experience of successive conflicts, of weary\r\nmarches seasoned with hunger, of prison starvation and the many\r\nprivations which fall to the lot of the soldier, all glorified when\r\ngiven freely in the defence of liberty and country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST BATTLE OF BRANDY STATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The sentinel's lonely round.--General Pope in command of the\r\n    army.--Is gunboat service effective?--First cavalry battle of\r\n    Brandy Station.--Under a rain of bullets.--Flipper's\r\n    orchard.--\"Bring up the brigade, boys!\"--Capture of Confederate\r\n    prisoners.--Story of a revolver.--Cedar Mountain.--Burial of the\r\n    dead rebel.--Retreat from the Rapidan.--The riderless\r\n    horse.--Death of Captain Walters.\r\n\r\nThe Harris Light now entered upon exciting times, and Corporal Glazier,\r\never at the post of duty, had little leisure for anything unconnected\r\nwith the exigencies of camp and field. At that period the men of both\r\narmies were guilty of the barbarous practice of shooting solitary\r\nsentinels at their posts, and no man went on guard at night without\r\nfeeling that an inglorious death might await him in the darkness, while\r\ndeprived of the power to strike a defensive blow, or to breathe a\r\nprayer.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-second of July, 1862, a new commander was assigned the\r\nArmy of Virginia in the person of General John Pope. General McClellan\r\nhad lost the confidence of the Northern people by his continued\r\ndisasters, and was at length succeeded by General Pope, who was placed\r\nat the head of the united commands of Fremont, Banks, McDowell (and\r\nlater in August), Burnside and Fitz-John Porter. General Pope commenced\r\nhis duties with a ringing address to the army under his command. Among\r\nother things, he declared: \"That he had heard much of 'lines of\r\ncommunication and retreat,' but the only _line_ in his opinion, that a\r\ngeneral should know anything about, _was the line of the enemy's\r\nretreat_.\" The _dash_ of such a theory of war was extremely\r\ninvigorating, and once more the hearts of the Northern people cherished\r\nand exulted in the hope that they had found the \"right man for the right\r\nplace.\" Popular enthusiasm reacted upon the army; their idol of\r\nyesterday was dethroned, and they girded their loins for a renewal of\r\nthe struggle, in the full belief that, with Pope to lead them, they\r\nwould write a very different chapter upon the page of History, from that\r\nwhich recorded their Peninsular campaign.\r\n\r\nHere we desire to correct a statement, then current, regarding the value\r\nof the gunboat service, viz., that McClellan's army was indebted for its\r\nsafety during the retreat from Malvern Hill to the gunboats stationed in\r\nJames River. That this was not the case is proven by the testimony of L.\r\nL. Dabney, chief-of-staff to General T. J. Jackson. He says: \"It is a\r\nfact worthy of note, that the fire of the gunboats, so much valued by\r\nthe Federals, and, at one time, so much dreaded by the Confederates, had\r\nno actual influence whatever in the battle. The noise and fury doubtless\r\nproduced a certain effect upon the emotions of the assailants, but this\r\nwas dependent upon their novelty. The loss effected by them was trivial\r\nwhen compared with the ravages of the field artillery; and it was found\r\nchiefly among their own friends. Far more of their ponderous missiles\r\nfell within their own lines than within those of the Confederates.\r\nIndeed, a fire directed at an invisible foe across two or three miles\r\nof intervening hills and woods can never reach its aim, save by\r\naccident. Nor is the havoc wrought by the larger projectiles in\r\nproportion to their magnitude. Where one of them explodes against a\r\nhuman body it does, indeed, crush it into a frightful mass, but it is\r\nnot likely to strike more men, in the open order of field operations,\r\nthan a shot of less weight; and the wretch blown to atoms by it is not\r\nput _hors du combat_ more effectually than he whose brain is penetrated\r\nby half an ounce of lead or iron. The broadside of a modern gunboat may\r\nconsist of three hundred pounds of iron projected by forty pounds of\r\npowder, but it is fired from only _two_ guns. The effect upon a line of\r\nmen, therefore, is but one-fifteenth of that which the same metal might\r\nhave had, fired from ten-pounder rifled guns.\"\r\n\r\nThe truth of the matter is, that so far as offensive operations in\r\nconjunction with that army were concerned, the gunboats were more\r\nornamental than useful; and it is not just that the modicum of glory\r\n(mingled with so much of disaster), won fairly upon that occasion by the\r\nland forces, should be awarded to another branch of the service.\r\n\r\nGeneral Pope was not permitted to remain long before an opportunity\r\noffered for practically testing his war theories. McClellan's troops had\r\nscarcely recovered breath after their retreat from before Richmond when\r\nLee, leaving his entrenchments, boldly threw himself forward and met\r\nPope and the Union forces, face to face on the old battle-ground of\r\nManassas. The Harris Light, prior to the second battle of Bull Run, had\r\nbeen offered, and eagerly accepted, an opportunity to cross swords\r\nwith the \"Southern chivalry,\" and the result now was a desperate\r\nencounter at Brandy Station. The first action which baptized in blood\r\nthis historic ground took place August twentieth, 1862. About six\r\no'clock in the morning a heavy column of Stuart's cavalry was discovered\r\napproaching from the direction of Culpepper, and Kilpatrick received\r\norders to check their advance. The Harris Light, acting as rear guard of\r\nBayard's brigade, kept the enemy in check until Bayard could form his\r\ncommand at a more favorable point two miles north of the station.\r\nCorporal Glazier was in the front rank of the first squadron that led\r\nthe charge, and repulsed the enemy. His horse was wounded in the neck,\r\nand his saddle and canteen perforated with bullets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Federal Canteens For Confederate Tobacco]\r\n\r\nThe fight at Flipper's Orchard preceded that at Brandy Station by more\r\nthan a month, having occurred on the Fourth of July. The Troy company of\r\nthe Harris Light had been ordered, about eight o'clock in the morning of\r\nthat day, to reconnoitre the Telegraph Road, south of Fredericksburg.\r\nLeaving camp, they soon came in sight of a detachment of Bath cavalry on\r\npatrol duty, escorting the Richmond mail. They learned the strength of\r\nthe enemy from some colored people along the route, and also the\r\nprobability that they would halt at Flipper's Orchard for refreshments.\r\nThis place was on the south bank of the Po River, some twenty miles from\r\nFredericksburg, in an angle formed by the roads leading to Bull Church\r\nand the Rappahannock. After following them for several hours, the\r\ncompany halted for consultation, \"and,\" says Glazier, \"our lieutenant\r\nput the question to vote, whether we should go on and capture the foe,\r\nabout one hundred strong, or return to camp. The vote was unanimous for\r\nbattle. I was in charge of the advance guard, having a squad of four\r\nmen, and received orders to strike a gallop. Just as we came within\r\nsight of the Orchard, we saw the Confederates dismounting and making\r\nleisurely arrangements for their repast. Dashing spurs into our horses'\r\nflanks, we wheeled round the corner and along the Bull Church Road,\r\nsweeping down upon them with tremendous clatter. 'Here they are, boys!'\r\nI shouted; 'bring up the brigade!' We were about forty in number, but\r\nsurprised them completely, and they fled panic-stricken. Twelve men and\r\nnine horses were captured. On reaching Dr. Flipper's house, I noticed a\r\ndismounted Confederate officer who, with others, was running across a\r\nwheat-field. I started in hot pursuit, jumping my horse over a six-rail\r\nfence to reach him. He fired upon me with both carbine and revolver, but\r\nmissed his mark, and by this time I stood over him with my\r\nnavy-revolver, demanding his surrender. He gave up his arms and\r\nequipments, which were speedily transferred to my own person. We made\r\nquick work of the fight, the whole affair lasting not longer than\r\nfifteen minutes. The Confederate reserves were only a short distance off\r\nat Bull Church, and we hurried back with our spoils towards the\r\nRappahannock, fearful that we might be overtaken. My prisoner, as I\r\nafterward learned, was Lieutenant Powell, in command of the patrol. His\r\nrevolver has a story of its own. It was a beautiful silver-mounted\r\nweapon, and I resolved to keep possession of it as my especial trophy,\r\ninstead of turning it over to the Quartermaster's Department. This was\r\nnot an easy matter, as vigilant eyes were on the look-out for all\r\n'munitions of war captured from the enemy,' which were consigned to a\r\ncommon receptacle. I therefore dug a hole in the ground of our tent and\r\nburied my treasure, where it remained until we changed our encampment.\r\nOne day, some time after, I carelessly left it lying on a log, a short\r\ndistance from camp, and on returning found it gone. While I stood there\r\ndeploring my ill luck, I heard a succession of clear, snapping shots\r\njust beyond a rise of ground directly in front of me, and recognized the\r\nfamiliar report of my revolver. Going in the direction of the shots, I\r\nrescued it from the hands of a sergeant by whom it had been temporarily\r\nconfiscated. After this adventure I concluded to incur no further risks\r\nwith the weapon, and so packed it in a cigar-box and sent it to my\r\nsister Elvira.\"\r\n\r\nThe battle of Cedar Mountain, fought on the afternoon of August ninth,\r\n1862, needs only a passing notice in connection with this record. The\r\nbattalion in which Corporal Glazier served acted as body-guard to\r\nGeneral McDowell, and arrived on the field just as the wave of battle\r\nwas receding. The following morning, on passing over the slopes of Cedar\r\nMountain, where the guns of General Banks had made sad havoc on the\r\nprevious day, a dead Confederate soldier, partially unburied, attracted\r\nthe attention of the troopers. At that period of the war a sentiment of\r\nextreme bitterness toward the adversary pervaded the ranks on both\r\nsides, and as the squadron swept by the men showered on the poor dead\r\nbody remarks expressive of their contempt. Corporal Glazier was an\r\nexception. Moved by an impulse born of our common humanity, he returned\r\nand buried the cold, stark corpse, covering it with mother Earth; and\r\nwhen questioned why he gave such consideration to a miserable dead\r\nrebel, replied, that he thought any man brave enough to die for a\r\nprinciple, should be respected for that bravery, whether his cause were\r\nright or wrong.\r\n\r\nOn the eighteenth of the month our cavalry relieved the infantry on the\r\nline of the Rapidan, and on the nineteenth, in a sharp skirmish between\r\nStuart's and Bayard's forces, Captain Charles Walters, of the Harris\r\nLight Cavalry, was killed. This officer was very popular in the\r\nregiment, and his death cast a gloom over all. Wrapped in a soldier's\r\nblanket his body was consigned to a soldier's grave at the solemn hour\r\nof midnight. And while the sad obsequies were being performed, orders\r\ncame for the retreat to Culpepper.\r\n\r\n    \"We buried him darkly at dead of night,\r\n      The sod with our bayonets turning,\r\n    By the struggling moonbeam's misty light,\r\n      And our lanterns dimly burning.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"Slowly and sadly we laid him down,\r\n      On the field of his fame fresh and gory;\r\n    We carved not a line, we raised not a stone,\r\n      But left him alone with his glory.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Burial Of Captain Walters At Midnight,\r\nDuring Pope's Retreat.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANASSAS AND FREDERICKSBURG.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Manassas.--The flying troops.--The unknown hero.--Desperate attempt\r\n    to stop the retreat.--Recruiting the decimated\r\n    ranks.--Fredericksburg.--Bravery of Meagher's brigade.--The\r\n    impregnable heights.--The cost of battles.--Death of\r\n    Bayard.--Outline of his life.\r\n\r\nThe plains of Manassas still speak to us. The smoke of battle that once\r\nhung over them has long since rolled away, but the blood of over forty\r\nthousand brave men of both North and South who here met, and fighting\r\nfell to rise no more, consecrates the soil. Between them and us the\r\ngrass has grown green for many and many a summer, but it cannot hide the\r\nmemory of their glorious deeds. From this altar of sacrifice the incense\r\nyet sweeps heavenward. The waters of Bull Run Creek swirl against their\r\nbanks as of old, and, to the heedless passer-by, utter nothing of the\r\ndespairing time when red carnage held awful sway, and counted its\r\nvictims by the thousand; yet, if one strays thitherward who can listen\r\nto the mystic language of the waves, they will reword their burden of\r\ndeath and of dark disaster which \"followed fast and followed faster,\"\r\nand at last overtook the devoted Northern army, and made wild confusion\r\nand wilder flight.\r\n\r\nNo general description of the battle need be given here. That portion\r\nonly which concerns the subject of this biography, now promoted to the\r\nrank of Sergeant, will be set in the framework of these pages.\r\nConcerning the part which he took in the action, and which occurred\r\nunder his own observation, he says:\r\n\r\n\"On the eventful thirtieth--it was August, 1862--our artillery occupied\r\nthe crest of a hill a short distance beyond Bull Run Creek, the cavalry\r\nregiments under Bayard being stationed next, and the infantry drawn up\r\nin line behind the cavalry.\r\n\r\n\"A short time before the battle opened, I was sent to a distant part of\r\nthe field to deliver an order. An ominous stillness pervaded the ranks.\r\nThe pickets as I passed them were silent, with faces firmly set towards\r\nthe front, and the shadow of coming battle hovered portentously, like a\r\ncloud with veiled lightnings, over the Union lines.\r\n\r\n\"It was the calm which precedes a storm, and the thunderbolts of war\r\nfell fast and heavy when the storm at length broke over our heads. I had\r\njust taken my place in the cavalry ranks when a shell from the enemy's\r\nguns whizzed over our heads with a long and spiteful shriek. One of the\r\nhorses attached to a caisson was in the path of the fiery missile, and\r\nthe next instant the animal's head was severed entirely from his neck.\r\nThe deathly silence was now broken, and more shot and shell followed in\r\nquick succession, plowing through the startled air and falling with\r\ndestructive force among the Union troops. This iron hail from the guns\r\nof the enemy was composed in part of old pieces of chain and broken iron\r\nrails, as well as the shot and shell ordinarily used. Our artillery soon\r\nreplied, but from some unexplained cause the Union troops in this\r\nportion of our line broke and fled in panic before a shot had been fired\r\nfrom the muskets of the enemy. This battle, like the first Bull Run,\r\nhad been well planned, and every effort which good generalship and good\r\njudgment could dictate in order to insure success, had been made by\r\nGenerals Pope and McDowell.\r\n\r\n\"At this crisis of affairs, the cavalry under Bayard and Kilpatrick were\r\nordered to the rear, to stem, if possible, the tide of retreat, but the\r\neffort was well nigh fruitless. Regiment after regiment surged by in one\r\ncontinuous and almost resistless wave. A cheer was heard to go up from\r\nthe Confederate ranks as Stuart's cavalry charged us, and though we\r\nreturned the charge it did not stop the panic which had taken possession\r\nof our troops.\r\n\r\n\"One of its causes was undoubtedly the supposition that the enemy was\r\nexecuting a flank movement on our left. In forty-five minutes from the\r\nbeginning of the battle, this part of the army was in full retreat; but\r\nthe determined stand made by Heintzelman, and also one or two heroic\r\nattempts to stop the backward-surging wave, saved our forces from utter\r\nrout and possible capture.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as the Union batteries were taken by the enemy, they were\r\nturned upon us, in addition to their own guns, and afterwards, on came\r\nStuart in a head-long charge with one of those hideous yells peculiar to\r\nthe Southern 'chivalry.' With thousands of others who were rapidly\r\nretiring, I had recrossed Bull Run Creek when my attention was arrested\r\nby a mounted officer who sprang out from the mass of flying men, and\r\nwaving his sword above his head, called on every one, irrespective of\r\nregiment, to rally around him and face the foe. He wore no golden\r\nleaf--no silver star. He was appealing to officers higher in command\r\nthan himself, who, mixed with the crowd, were hurrying by. His manner,\r\ntense with excitement, was strung up to the pitch of heroism, and his\r\npresence was like an inspiration, as he stood outside the mass, a mark\r\nfor the bullets of the enemy.\r\n\r\n\"I halted, filled with admiration for so noble an example of valor, and\r\nthen rode rapidly towards him. Seeing me, he galloped forward to meet me\r\nand asked my aid in making a stand against the enemy.\r\n\r\n\"'Sergeant,' said he, 'you are just in time. As you are mounted, you can\r\nbe of great service in rallying these men for a stand on this ground.'\r\n\r\n\"'Lieutenant,' I replied, 'they will not listen to the wearer of these\r\nchevrons.'\r\n\r\n\"'Tear off your chevrons,' said this unknown hero,--'the infantry will\r\nnot know you from a field officer--and get as many men to turn their\r\nmuskets to the front as you can.'\r\n\r\n\"Lieutenant,' I responded, 'I will do all I can to help you,' and the\r\ninsignia of non-commissioned rank was immediately stripped from my\r\nsleeves.\r\n\r\n\"I put myself under his command and fought with him until he gave the\r\norder to retire. While he was talking with me he was at the same time\r\ncalling on the men to make a stand, telling them they could easily hold\r\nthe position. He seemed to take in the situation at a glance.\r\n\r\n\"The enemy having advanced to the first crest of hills, were throwing\r\ntheir infantry forward with full force, and with the three thousand or\r\nmore of men who rallied around this heroic officer, a stand was made on\r\nthe rising ground north of Bull Run from which the advance of the enemy\r\nwas opposed. We held this position for half an hour, which gave\r\nconsiderable time for reorganization.\r\n\r\n\"While riding along the line, helping my unknown superior as best I\r\ncould, my horse was shot--the first experience of this kind which had\r\nbefallen me.\r\n\r\n\"Just as the disaster was occurring which culminated in retreat, General\r\nMcDowell, on his white horse, galloped up to the guns behind which\r\nHeintzelman was blazing destruction on the Confederates. Alighting from\r\nhis horse he sighted the guns and gave a personal superintendence to\r\nthis part of the action. An artillery captain, standing by his battery\r\nwhile his horses were shot down, his pieces in part disabled, and the\r\ninfantry deserting him, shed tears in consequence.\r\n\r\n\"'You need not feel badly over this affair,' said the general, 'General\r\nMcDowell is responsible for this misfortune. Stand by your guns as long\r\nas you can. If the general is blamed, _your_ bravery will be praised.'\r\n\r\n\"Was there a touch of irony in this remark which met in advance the\r\ngrumblings and questionings of the future? Was it the sarcasm of a man\r\nwho, having done his utmost, could not yet prevent disaster, and who\r\nknew that an unthinking public sometimes measured loyalty by success?\r\n\r\n\"Later in the day our regiment--the 'Harris Light Cavalry'--lost a\r\nsquadron. Most of them were killed.\r\n\r\n\"In the deepening twilight we charged the enemy just as they were\r\nforming for a similar attack on us. They were compelled to halt, and\r\nPope was thus enabled to discover their position and arrange for the\r\nnext day's defence.\r\n\r\n\"On the night of the thirtieth, the enemy occupied the battle-field and\r\nburied the dead of both armies. And thus it was that Bull Run again ran\r\nred with patriot blood and witnessed the retreat of the Union\r\nbattalions.\r\n\r\n\"By what strange fatality General Pope was allowed to struggle on alone\r\nagainst an army twice the size of the Federal force, has not been\r\nsatisfactorily explained. One is almost tempted to believe, with\r\nastrologists, that baleful stars sometimes preside with malign influence\r\nover the destinies of battles, as they are said to do over individuals\r\nand nations.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Manassas, the Harris Light Cavalry was so reduced in\r\nnumbers that it was ordered into camp at Hall's Hill, near Washington,\r\nwith a view of recruiting its wasted strength and equipment. They\r\nremained at that point until November, when they were again moved\r\nforward to form the principal picket line along the front, prior to the\r\nFederal disaster at Fredericksburg.\r\n\r\nBurnside, having strongly secured the mountain passes in the\r\nneighborhood, in order to conceal from Lee his real object, made a\r\n_feint_ in the direction of Gordonsville; but the keen eye of the\r\nConfederate generalissimo penetrated his true design and took measures\r\nto defeat its accomplishment. Upon the eighth of this month, a lively\r\nencounter between the Harris Light and a detachment of Confederate\r\ncavalry resulted in the defeat of the latter, and soon after, the\r\nregiment joined the main army.\r\n\r\nAs all know, the battle of Fredericksburg was fought and lost during the\r\nthree days intervening between the thirteenth and sixteenth of December.\r\nBurnside's gallant army, in the midst of darkness, rain and tempestuous\r\nwind, came reeling back from a conflict of terrible ferocity and\r\nfatality. Six times in one day Meagher's gallant Irishmen were literally\r\nhurled against Marye's Heights, a point of almost impregnable strength,\r\nand which, even if carried, would still have exposed them to the\r\ncommanding fire of other and stronger Confederate positions.\r\n\r\nTwenty times had charge and counter-charge swept the tide of battle to\r\nand fro--at what terrible cost, the killed and wounded, strewing the\r\nground like leaves in the forest, made answer. Twelve thousand men lay\r\ndead on the field when the battle ended, and one thousand prisoners were\r\ntaken, besides nine thousand stand of arms.\r\n\r\nAlthough this battle seems to have been well planned by General\r\nBurnside, a want of capacity to meet unforeseen emergencies doubtless\r\ncontributed to his defeat. He committed a fatal error at a critical\r\nmoment, by sending General Franklin an equivocal _recommendation_,\r\ninstead of an _order_ to attack the enemy in force. The enemy, however,\r\nthough having nobly held their ground, could not boast of having\r\nadvanced their lines by so much as a foot. There were, indeed, but few\r\neven of the Confederate officers, who knew they had been victorious, and\r\nthe amazement of their army was beyond description when the gray dawn of\r\nthe fourteenth of December revealed the deserted camps of the Federals,\r\nwho had withdrawn their entire command during the night to the north\r\nside of the river.\r\n\r\nHad General Franklin brought his men into action, as he should have\r\ndone, at the critical moment when the issue of the fight was trembling\r\nin the balance, the fortunes of this day would have terminated\r\ndifferently. Had the splendid divisions of brave Phil. Kearney or\r\n\"Fighting Joe Hooker\" been ordered into the arena, and lent the\r\ninspiration of their presence to this hour of need, the scales of\r\nvictory would have turned in an opposite direction.\r\n\r\nThe \"might have beens\" always grow thickly on the soil of defeat.\r\n\r\nAmong the lamented dead of this day's havoc, no loss was more keenly\r\nfelt than that of Major-General George Dashiel Bayard. He was standing\r\namong a group of officers around the trunk of an old tree, near the\r\nheadquarters of Generals Franklin and Smith, when the enemy suddenly\r\nbegan to shell a battery near by, and one of the deadly missiles struck\r\nthis gallant leader. He was carried to the field-hospital, mortally\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\nQuietly turning to the surgeon who examined his ghastly wounds, he asked\r\n\"if there was any hope.\" On being informed that there was none, he\r\nproceeded with undisturbed composure, and without a murmur of pain, to\r\ndictate three letters. One of these was to his affianced bride. This\r\nday, it was said, had been appointed for his wedding. The time-hands\r\nmarked the hour of eight when this letter was finished, and, as he\r\nuttered its closing words, his spirit fled from the shattered body and\r\nleft it only cold and tenantless clay. He was but twenty-eight years of\r\nage, of prepossessing appearance and manners, with as brave a soul as\r\never defended the flag of the Union, and a capacity for military\r\nusefulness equal to any man in the service. Gradually he had arisen\r\nfrom one position of honor and responsibility to another, proving\r\nhimself tried and true in each promotion, while his cavalry comrades\r\nespecially were watching the developments of his growing power with\r\nunabating enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nBriefly, the outlines of his history are as follows:\r\n\r\nHe was born December eighteenth, 1835, at Seneca Falls, New York, from\r\nwhence, in 1842, he removed with his parents to Fairfield, Iowa. From\r\nthis place he went to the Dorris Military Institute at St. Louis,\r\nMissouri, where he remained eighteen months.\r\n\r\nThe family then removed to the East, and settled at Morristown, New\r\nJersey. From Morristown, he entered West Point Academy. When twenty\r\nyears of age, he graduated with the highest honors, and, strange to say,\r\nit was through the offices of Jefferson Davis, then Secretary of War,\r\nthat he was at once assigned to a cavalry regiment as second lieutenant.\r\nHis subsequent career, so full of brilliance and the true spirit of\r\nheroism, is better known to the country.\r\n\r\nWatered by the dews of hallowed remembrance, his fame, as a sweet\r\nflower, still exhales its fragrance, and finds rich soil in the hearts\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\n    \"How sleep the brave who sink to rest,\r\n    By all their country's wishes blest?\r\n    When Spring, with dewy fingers cold,\r\n    Returns to deck their hallowed mould,\r\n    She there shall dress a sweeter sod\r\n    Than Fancy's feet have ever trod.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"By fairy hands their knell is rung,\r\n    By forms unseen their dirge is sung,\r\n    There Honor comes, a pilgrim gray,\r\n    To bless the turf that wraps their clay.\r\n    And Freedom shall awhile repair,\r\n    To dwell a weeping hermit there.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNWRITTEN HISTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"What boots a weapon in a withered hand?\"--A thunderbolt\r\n    wasted.--War upon hen-roosts.--A bit of unpublished history.--A\r\n    fierce fight with Hampton's cavalry.--\"In one red burial\r\n    blent.\"--From camp to home.--Troubles never come singly.--The\r\n    combat.--The capture.--A superfluity of Confederate\r\n    politeness.--Lights and shadows.\r\n\r\nWhile the events we have narrated were occurring, the \"Harris Light\" was\r\nnot idle. Under the command of their favorite Kilpatrick, they made a\r\ndashing raid, and completely encircled the rebels under Lee, penetrating\r\nto within seven miles of Richmond. Such duties as were assigned them\r\nwere effectively performed, and yet, General Hooker's object in\r\ndetaching his cavalry from the main army remained unaccomplished, either\r\nby reason of General Stoneman's want of comprehension, or want of\r\nenergy. This general, instead of hurling his thirteen thousand troopers\r\nlike a thunderbolt upon the body of the Confederates, divided and\r\nfrittered away the strength under his command by detaching and\r\nscattering it into mere scouting parties, to \"raid on smoke-houses and\r\ncapture hen-roosts.\" General Hooker was very naturally exasperated by\r\nthis conduct. The detachment from the main army of such a splendid body\r\nof horse, was a measure he had taken after mature deliberation, and with\r\nthe view of cutting off Lee's communications with Richmond; thus\r\nprecluding the possibility of his being reinforced during the grand\r\nattack which Hooker contemplated upon that leader at Chancelorsville.\r\n\r\nThe Federal general attributed the loss of that battle in a great degree\r\nto Stoneman's failure to carry out the spirit of his orders. In a letter\r\nto the author, long after that field of carnage had bloomed and\r\nblossomed with the flowers and fruits of Peace, when the heart-burning\r\nand fever engendered by the contest had subsided, and it was possible to\r\nobtain access to men's judgments, General Hooker wrote: \"Soon after\r\nStonewall Jackson started to turn my right (a project of which I was\r\ninformed by a prisoner), I despatched a courier to my right corps\r\ncommander informing him of the intended movement, and instructing him to\r\nput himself in readiness to receive the attack. This dispatch was dated\r\nat nine o'clock A. M., and yet, when 'Stonewall' did attack, the men of\r\nthis corps had their arms stacked some distance from them, and were\r\nbusily engaged in cooking their supper. When the attack came these men\r\nran like a flock of sheep. _This_, in a wooded country, where a _corps_\r\nought to be able to check the advance of a large army. To make this more\r\nclear, I must tell you that the corps commander, General Howard,\r\nreceived the dispatch while on his bed, and, after reading it, put it in\r\nhis pocket, where it remained until after the battle of Gettysburg,\r\nwithout communicating its contents to his division commander, or to any\r\none!!! My opinion is that not a gun of ours was fired upon Stonewall\r\nJackson's force until he had passed nearly into the centre of my army.\r\nJudge, if you can, of the consternation throughout that army caused by\r\nthis exhibition of negligence and cowardice. One word more, in regard to\r\nthe cavalry. I had to have, under the seniority rule of the service, a\r\nwooden man for its commander. If you will turn to the first volume of\r\nthe Report of the Committee on the Conduct of the War, you will find my\r\ninstructions to General Stoneman, and then you will see the mistake that\r\nI made in informing him of the strength and position of the enemy he\r\nwould be likely to encounter on his raid, as that officer only made use\r\nof the information to avoid the foe. He traveled at night, made\r\nextensive detours, and did not interrupt the traffic on the railroads\r\nbetween Lee's army and Richmond for a single day. As he was charged to\r\nmake this duty his especial object of accomplishment over all others, he\r\nhad twelve thousand sabres, double the force the enemy could collect\r\nfrom all quarters. I had men enough with me to have won Chancelorsville\r\nwithout the cavalry and other corps, but of what use could a field of\r\nbattle have been to me when the enemy could fall back a few miles and\r\npost himself on a field possessing still greater advantages to him?\r\nGeneral Grant did this, and is entitled to all the merit of his\r\nsoldiership from a grateful country. I believe if he had sacrificed\r\nevery officer and soldier of his command in the attainment of this\r\nobject, the country would have applauded him. When I crossed the\r\nRappahannock I aimed to capture General Lee's whole army and thus end\r\nthe war, by manoeuvring, and not by butchery.\"\r\n\r\nWhile his superior in command did little that was practically useful\r\nwith the cavalry, Kilpatrick covered his little band with glory, and\r\ngave the people of Richmond, a scare as great as Stuart administered to\r\nour Quaker friends in Pennsylvania during his famous foray into the\r\nborder counties of the Keystone State.\r\n\r\nTheir return was almost immediately followed by the second grand cavalry\r\nbattle of Brandy Station, June ninth, 1863, a struggle as hotly\r\ncontested as any that occurred during the war. In this encounter\r\nSergeant Willard Glazier took part, leading the first platoon of the\r\nfirst battalion that crossed the Rappahannock. Matters were now assuming\r\na warlike aspect. The Valley of the Shenandoah groaned beneath the tramp\r\nof the main army of the Confederacy, under Lee. The Federal general,\r\nPleasanton, and the Confederate general, Stuart, were in fierce conflict\r\namong the Blue Ridge mountains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sergeant Glazier At Aldie. \"Come On Boys! One\r\nCharge, And The Day Is Ours.\"]\r\n\r\nAt Aldie, on the seventeenth of June, 1863, the \"Harris Light\" led the\r\ndivision under Kilpatrick, Glazier's squadron again being the advance\r\nguard--his place at the head of the long column which wound down the\r\nroad. As they came upon Aldie, the enemy's advance, under W. H. F. Lee,\r\nwas unexpectedly encountered. But Kilpatrick was equal to the occasion.\r\nDashing to the front, his voice rang out, \"Form platoons! trot! march!\"\r\nDown through the streets they charged, and along the Middleburg Road,\r\nleading over the low hill beyond. This position was gained so quickly\r\nand gallantly that Fitzhugh Lee, taken by surprise, made no opposition\r\nto the brilliant advance, though immediately afterward he fought for two\r\nhours to regain the lost position, while the guns of his batteries\r\nblazed destruction upon the Federal cavalry. The latter, however,\r\nhandsomely repelled the attack.\r\n\r\nOn the crest of the hill there was a field of haystacks, inclosed in a\r\nbarricade of rails. Behind these the enemy occupied a strong position,\r\nand their sharp-shooters had annoyed Kilpatrick's lines to such an\r\nextent as to prevent their advance on the left. It was well known to\r\nthe officers of the \"Harris Light\" that their regiment had not met\r\nKilpatrick's expectations on the field of Brandy Station, and on the\r\nmorning of this battle they had asked their general for \"an opportunity\r\nto retrieve their reputation.\" This chance came soon enough. Kilpatrick,\r\nordering forward a battalion of the \"Harris Light,\" and giving the men a\r\nfew words of encouragement, turned to Major McIrvin and pointing to the\r\nfield of haystacks, said: \"Major, there is the opportunity you ask for!\r\nGo take that position!\" Away dashed the \"Harris Light,\" and in a moment\r\nthe enemy was reached and the struggle began. The horses could not leap\r\nthe barricade, the men dismounted, scaled the barriers, and with drawn\r\nsabres rushed furiously upon the hidden foe, who quickly called for\r\nquarter. Aldie was by far the most bloody cavalry battle of the war. The\r\nrebel \"chivalry\" was beaten; Kilpatrick from this moment took a proud\r\nstand among the most famous of the Union cavalry generals, and the fame\r\nof the regiment was greatly enhanced. To quote our young soldier in\r\n\"Battles for the Union:\" \"Many a brave soul suffered death's sad eclipse\r\nat Aldie, and many escaped the storm of bullets when to escape was\r\nmiraculous. In looking back upon that desperate day, I have often\r\nwondered by what strange fatality I passed through its rain of fire\r\nunhurt; but the field which brought a harvest of death to so many others\r\nmarked an era in my own humble, military history, which I recall with\r\npride and pleasure, for from the Battle of Aldie I date my first\r\ncommission. The mantle of rank which fell from one whom death had\r\ngarnered on that ground dropped upon my shoulders, and I was proud and\r\ngrateful to wear it in my country's service. I feel proud also of having\r\nbeen a participant in the 'Battle of the Haystacks,' where the glorious\r\nsquadrons of the 'Harris Light' swept into the mad conflict with the\r\nsame invincible bravery that distinguished them on the field of Brandy\r\nStation. Every soldier of the saddle who there fought under Kilpatrick\r\nmay justly glory in the laurels won at Aldie.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same month followed the engagements of Middleburg and Upperville,\r\nin each of which the \"Harris Light\" participated with great eclat,\r\ncharging in face of the enemy's guns, forming in platoon under fire, and\r\nrouting him in splendid style. At Upperville, Kilpatrick received orders\r\nto charge the town. With drawn sabres and shouts which made the\r\nmountains and plains resound, they rushed upon the foe. The encounter\r\nwas terrific. The enemy's horse were driven through the village of\r\nParis, and finally through Ashby's Gap upon their own infantry columns\r\nin the Shenandoah Valley. At Rector's Cross-Roads, where Kilpatrick\r\nordered the \"Harris Light\" to charge the enemy's battery, as they were\r\nforming, a fatal bullet pierced Glazier's horse, and it fell dead under\r\nhim. Fortunately he was not dragged down in the fall, and as he struck\r\nthe ground a riderless horse belonging to an Indiana company came up.\r\nIts owner, a sergeant, had been shot dead, and, rapidly mounting,\r\nLieutenant Glazier rode forward with his regiment as they valiantly\r\ncharged the enemy's position.\r\n\r\nThese actions were succeeded by the battle of Gettysburg (July first,\r\nsecond and third), in which the disasters of Chancelorsville and\r\nFredericksburg were fully retrieved, and the rebel army, under Lee,\r\nreceived a blow so staggering in its effects as to result in a loss of\r\nprestige, and all hope in the ultimate success of their cause. Prior to\r\nthis battle the Confederates had warred upon the North aggressively;\r\nthenceforward they were compelled to act upon the defensive. During the\r\nprogress of this great and (so far as the ultimate fate of the\r\nConfederacy was concerned) decisive battle, the cavalry, including the\r\nbrigade to which our subject was attached, performed brilliant service.\r\nThey held Stuart's force effectually at bay, and while the retreat of\r\nthe rebel army was in progress their services were in constant\r\nrequisition. On the first day of the battle, General John Buford,\r\ncommanding the Third Cavalry Division, was in position on the\r\nChambersburg Pike, about two miles west of the village. Early in the\r\nforenoon the vanguard of the rebel army appeared in front of them, and\r\nour dauntless troopers charged the enemy vigorously, and drove them back\r\nupon their reserves.\r\n\r\nThe second day of the battle was spent by the cavalry in hard, bold and\r\nbloody work, in collision with their old antagonists, Stuart, Lee and\r\nHampton. Charge succeeded charge; the carbine, pistol and sabre were\r\nused by turns; the artillery thundering long after the infantry around\r\nGettysburg had sunk to rest exhausted with the carnage of the weary day.\r\nStuart, however, was driven back on his supports, and badly beaten.\r\n\r\nUpon the third day the sun rose bright and warm upon the bleached forms\r\nof the dead strewn over the sanguinary field; upon the wounded, and upon\r\nlong, glistening lines of armed men ready to renew the conflict. Each\r\nantagonist, rousing every element of power, seemed resolved upon victory\r\nor death. Finally victory saluted the Union banners, and with great loss\r\nthe rebel army sounded the retreat. \"Thus,\" says Glazier in his \"Battles\r\nfor the Union\"--\"the Battle of Gettysburg ended--the bloody\r\nturning-point of the rebellion--the bloody baptism of the redeemed\r\nrepublic. Nearly twenty thousand men from the Union ranks had been\r\nkilled and wounded, and a larger number of the rebels, making the\r\nenormous aggregate of at least forty thousand, whose blood was shed to\r\nfertilize the Tree of Liberty.\"\r\n\r\nDuring this sanguinary battle; the cavalry were in daily and hourly\r\nconflict with the enemy's well-trained horse under their respective\r\ndashing leaders. The sabre was no \"useless ornament,\" but a deadly\r\nweapon, and \"dead cavalrymen\" and their dead chargers, were sufficiently\r\nnumerous to have drawn forth an exclamation of approval from even so\r\nexacting a commander as \"Fighting Joe Hooker.\" Haggerstown, Boonsboro',\r\nWilliamsport and Falling Waters, all attested the great efficiency of\r\nthe cavalry arm, and at the end of the month it was an assured,\r\nconfident and capable body of dragoons, that, according to Captain\r\nGlazier, \"crossed the Rapidan for, as they believed, the purpose of a\r\ncontinued advance movement against the enemy.\"\r\n\r\nAnd here, parenthetically, we may observe, that he, and other recent\r\nwriters (Mr. Lossing being an exception), are scarcely accurate in so\r\ndesignating the river crossed by them as the Rapidan. It was the _chief\r\ntributary of the Rappahannock_, while two sister streams, which together\r\nform the Pamunkey, are known to local topography as the North and South\r\nRapid Anna rivers.\r\n\r\nIt was a pleasant locality, and the \"Harris Light\" encamped there for\r\nseveral weeks, having no occupation more exciting or belligerent than\r\npicket duty. Duties of a more stirring character, were, however,\r\nawaiting them, and as these are intimately associated with the career of\r\nthe subject of this biography, the delineation of whose life is the\r\npurpose of the writer, we will give them something more than a cursory\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\nWe will first, however, take the opportunity of introducing a letter\r\nfrom our young cavalryman to his parents, illustrative in some measure\r\nof his intelligence and soldierly qualities, while it is no less so of\r\nhis sense of filial duty:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  Headquarters Harris Lgt. Cavalry,\r\n                                     Near Hartwood Church, Virginia,\r\n                                             _August 22d, 1863_.\r\n\r\n     Dear Father and Mother:\r\n\r\n     Another birthday has rolled around, and finds me still in the army.\r\n     Two years have passed since we were lying quietly in camp near\r\n     Washington. Little did I think at that time that the insurrection,\r\n     which was then in process of organization, was of such mighty\r\n     magnitude as to be able to continue in its treacherous designs\r\n     until now. Newspaper quacks and mercenary correspondents kept facts\r\n     from the public, and published falsehoods in their stead.\r\n     Experience has at last taught us the true state of things, and we\r\n     now feel that the great work of putting down the rebellion is to be\r\n     accomplished only by energy, perseverance and unity. Our cause\r\n     never looked more favorable than to-day. It is no longer a rumor\r\n     that Vicksburg and Port Hudson have fallen, but a stern reality, an\r\n     actual and glorious victory to our arms, and a sure exposure of the\r\n     waning strength of the ill-fated Confederacy. Charleston and Mobile\r\n     must soon follow the example of the West, and then the Army of the\r\n     Potomac will strike the final blow in Virginia.\r\n\r\n     Kilpatrick's cavalry is now watching the movements of the enemy on\r\n     the Rappahannock--his head-quarters being near Hartwood Church. I\r\n     have seen nothing that would interest you much, save a few\r\n     expeditions among the bushwhackers of Stafford County.\r\n\r\n     It may not be uninteresting to you to learn that I have just been\r\n     promoted to a lieutenancy, my commission to date from the\r\n     seventeenth of June. I have received four successive promotions\r\n     since my enlistment. Your son can boast that his Colonel says he\r\n     has earned his commission. Political or moneyed influence has had\r\n     nothing to do with it. I have been in command of a platoon or\r\n     company ever since the thirteenth of last April, and have very\r\n     frequently been in charge of a squadron. I conclude by asking you\r\n     to remember me kindly to all my friends,\r\n\r\n                         And believe me, as ever, your dutiful son,\r\n                                                               Willard.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that the greater part of the spring of this year\r\n(1863), that is, from the time the Federal army moved from its\r\nwinter-quarters in Stafford and King George counties, and all the early\r\nsummer, were passed by the belligerent forces in efforts to compel their\r\nadversaries to fall back on their respective capitals. The people and\r\nthe press on both sides were clamoring for the accomplishment of\r\n_something definite_, and when Vicksburg fell, and on the stricken field\r\nof Gettysburg, victory perched upon the Union banners, our hopes seemed\r\non the point of realization, but the fall of the leaf found the hostile\r\narmies still confronting each other. Lee's force, though fearfully\r\nshattered, maintained its organization, and to all appearance had lost\r\nlittle of its former self-confidence. General Meade, perhaps the most\r\nscientific strategist of all the generals who had held the chief command\r\nof the Army of the Potomac, was severely criticised, simply because he\r\ndeclined by \"raw Haste, half-sister to Delay,\" to hazard the ultimate\r\nfruition of his well-laid plans; and Captain Glazier, it must be\r\nadmitted, was one of his adverse critics. We think the censure was\r\nuncalled for. Wellington had but one Waterloo, and although to him was\r\ndue the victory, it was the fresh army of Blucher that pursued the\r\nretreating French, and made defeat irretrievable. But whenever Lee, or\r\nMcClellan, Jackson, or Meade obtained a hard-earned victory, the people,\r\non either side, were dissatisfied because their triumph was not followed\r\nup by, at once and forever, annihilating the foe!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM BATTLE-FIELD TO PRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n  A situation to try the stoutest hearts.--Hail Columbia!--Every man\r\n    a hero.--Kilpatrick's ingenuity.--A pen-picture from \"Soldiers of\r\n    the Saddle.\"--Glazier thanked by his general.--Cessation of\r\n    hostilities.--A black day.--Fitzhugh Lee proposes to crush\r\n    Kilpatrick.-\"Kil's\" audacity.--Capture of Lieutenant\r\n    Glazier.--Petty tyranny.--\"Here, Yank, hand me that thar hat, and\r\n    overcoat, and boots.\"\r\n\r\nAt this period of the war, the Cavalry Corps was separated into three\r\ndivisions. Buford with his division fell back by the way of Stevensburg,\r\nand Gregg by Sulphur Springs; leaving Kilpatrick with the brigades of\r\nCuster and Davies, which included the \"Harris Light,\" on the main\r\nthoroughfare along the railroad line. \"No sooner,\" says Glazier, \"had\r\nKilpatrick moved out of Culpepper, than Hampton's cavalry division made\r\na furious attack upon the 'Harris Light,' then acting as rear-guard,\r\nwith the evident design of breaking through upon the main column to\r\ndisperse, or delay it, so as to enable a flanking force to intercept our\r\nretreat. Gallantly repelling this assault, the command, on the eleventh\r\nof October, advanced to Brandy Station, where an accumulation of\r\nformidable difficulties threatened our annihilation.\" It appears that\r\nFitzhugh Lee, with the flower of the Confederate cavalry, held\r\npossession of the only road over which it was possible for Kilpatrick to\r\nretire, while Stuart, at the head of another body of cavalry, supported\r\nby artillery well posted along a line of hills, completely covered the\r\nFederal left. His right was exposed to a galling fire from\r\nsharp-shooters hidden behind the forest; \"while just behind them was\r\nHampton's legion threatening speedy destruction to its surrounded foe.\"\r\nHere was a situation to try the stoutest hearts. Nothing daunted,\r\nhowever, by this terrific array of an enemy very much his superior in\r\nnumbers, Kilpatrick displayed that decision and daring which ever\r\ncharacterized him. \"His preparations for a grand charge,\" for he had\r\ndetermined to cut his way out of this _cul-de-sac_, \"were soon\r\ncompleted. Forming his division into three lines of battle, he assigned\r\nthe right to General Davies, the left to General Custer; and placing\r\nhimself, with General Pleasanton, in the centre, advanced with terrible\r\ndetermination to the contest. Approaching to within a few yards of the\r\nenemy's lines, he ordered the band to strike up a national air, to whose\r\nstirring strains was added the blast of scores of bugles ringing out the\r\n'charge.' Brave hearts became braver, and weak ones waxed strong, until\r\n'pride of country had touched this raging sea of thought, and emotion\r\nkindled an unconquerable principle that affirmed every man a hero until\r\ndeath.'\" The troops filled the air with their battle-cry, and hurled\r\nthemselves on their unequal foe. \"So swiftly swept forward this tide of\r\nanimated power that the Confederates broke and fled, and Kilpatrick thus\r\nescaped a disaster which had seemed inevitable.\"\r\n\r\n\"No one\"--we quote from \"Soldiers of the Saddle,\"--\"who looked upon that\r\nwonderful panorama, can ever forget it. On the great field were\r\nriderless horses and dying men; clouds of dirt from solid shot and\r\nbursting shells, broken caissons, and overturned ambulances; and long\r\nlines of dragoons dashing into the charge, with their drawn and firmly\r\ngrasped sabres glistening in the light of the declining sun; while far\r\nbeyond the scene of tumult were the dark green forests skirting the\r\ndistant Rappahannock.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lieutenant Glazier At Brandy Station. \"Come\r\nOn, Boys! We Must Break That Line.\"]\r\n\r\nIn this action Glazier, who occupied the post of volunteer aide to\r\nGeneral Davies, had his horse shot under him, received a sabre-stroke on\r\nthe shoulder, two bullets in his hat, and had his scabbard split by a\r\nshot or shell. His conduct was such as to obtain for him the thanks of\r\nhis general and a promise of early promotion. This was the fourth battle\r\nof Brandy Station in which the Harris Light Cavalry had been engaged.\r\nThe first occurred on August the twentieth, 1862, the second on June\r\nninth, the third on September twelfth, and this last action on October\r\neleventh, 1863. They were followed by a number of spirited engagements\r\nbetween the Federal cavalry and the cavaliers of the South--the former\r\nunder Generals Buford and Kilpatrick, and the latter under Stuart and\r\nWade Hampton. In all of these both sides behaved gallantly, the result\r\nbeing the masterly retreat of the Federals across the Rappahannock to\r\nthe old battle-ground of Bull Run, where they made a protracted halt.\r\n\r\nFrom this time until the fifteenth of October, nothing of sufficient\r\nimportance transpired to require mention here. Upon that day an\r\nindecisive battle was fought at Bristoe Station, which was followed by\r\nanother calm that continued until the nineteenth of October--a black day\r\nin the calendar of Willard Glazier's life.\r\n\r\nFar away among the peaceful hills of his native State there fell upon\r\nhis father's house a sorrow such as its inmates had never known before.\r\nNot that this family had escaped the ordinary bereavements of human\r\nlife. On the contrary, two little children had been taken from them at\r\nintervals of time which seemed to them cruelly brief. But the death of\r\nan infant, while a sad, is a beautiful thing to witness. There is no\r\nflower that blooms on a baby grave that does not speak to the world-worn\r\nheart, of _Immortality_. The grief, therefore, is gentle in its touch.\r\nBut with the ebb of a maturer life the sorrow is of a different\r\ncharacter, and when the physician announced to this worthy couple that\r\ntheir daughter, Elvira, would die, they were stunned by the blow, and\r\nwhen the event came \"they refused\" like Rachel \"to be comforted.\" The\r\nchild that is going from us is, for the time, the favorite, and these\r\nafflicted parents could not realize that she who had grown up among\r\nthem, the ewe lamb of their flock, could be torn from their loving arms,\r\nand go down, like coarser clay, to the dark grave. She was so good, so\r\ngentle, so loving to her kindred, that their simple hearts could not\r\nunderstand how God could let her die, in the very bloom and beauty of\r\nher maidenhood. But though crushed, they bowed their heads in\r\nsubmission. Their hearts were almost broken, but they rebelled not\r\nagainst the Hand that chastened them. Why is it that such examples of\r\ntender feeling and unquestioning faith are seldom found in cities? Is it\r\nthat \"the memories which peaceful country scenes call up, are not of\r\nthis world; nor of _its_ thoughts and hopes?\" That \"their gentle\r\ninfluences teach us how to weave fresh garlands for the graves of those\r\nwe love, purify our thoughts, and beat down old enmities and hatreds?\"\r\nAnd that \"beneath all this there lingers in the least reflective mind,\r\na vague and half-formed consciousness of having held such feelings long\r\nbefore, which calls up solemn thoughts of distant times to come, and\r\nbends down pride and worldliness before it?\" The physician had said that\r\nElvira would not live another day, and the mother sat down to the sad\r\ntask of writing the mournful news to her soldier son. Meanwhile beyond\r\nthe Rappahannock, a scene was on the eve of being enacted, which was\r\ndestined to inflict upon her a pain as poignant as that she was, now\r\nabout to bestow.\r\n\r\nThe night of October eighteenth was passed by Kilpatrick's command at\r\nGainesville, but the first faint streak of dawn saw him and his faithful\r\nfollowers in the saddle, booted, spurred, and equipped for some\r\nenterprise as yet unexplained to them, but evidently, in their leader's\r\nestimation, one of \"pith and moment.\" At the word of command, the force,\r\nincluding the \"Harris Light,\" moved forward at a quick trot, taking the\r\nroad to Warrenton, and anticipating a brush with Stuart's cavalry who,\r\nduring the previous ten hours, had thrown out videttes in their\r\nimmediate front.\r\n\r\nThe surprise of the Federals was great to find their advance unimpeded,\r\nand that, instead of offering opposition, the Confederates fell back as\r\nrapidly as their opponents approached. On they dashed, unopposed and\r\nunobstructed, until Buckland Mills was reached. At this point they found\r\nthemselves checked, and in a manner that somewhat astounded them. As\r\nthey arrived within a stone's throw of that village, Fitzhugh Lee, with\r\nhis magnificent following, struck their flank. That astute and valiant\r\nofficer, it appears, had cut his way through the Federal infantry at\r\nThoroughfare-Gap, and accompanied by a battery of flying artillery,\r\nswept down upon Kilpatrick, designing to crush him at a blow. General\r\nStuart, taking in the situation, and keenly anxious to profit by the\r\nadvantage thus afforded him, instantly turned upon and charged the\r\nFederals in his front, while, as if to make their utter annihilation a\r\ncertainty, the rebel General Gordon, with a third body of men (his\r\nproximity at that moment not being suspected), bore down fiercely on\r\ntheir left, threatening to cut Kilpatrick's division in two.\r\n\r\nKilpatrick possessed an extraordinary amount of ingenuity in devising\r\nmeans of escape from a dangerous position. In the present case his plan\r\nwas formed in an instant, and executed as soon as formed. He immediately\r\nchanged his front, and, without the slightest hesitation, headed a mad\r\nand desperate charge upon Fitzhugh Lee's advancing column. The merit of\r\nthe movement lay in its audacity; it was the only one that promised the\r\nremotest chance of escape to the entrapped Federals. Executed with great\r\nrapidity and desperate decision, the movement resulted in the salvation\r\nof the greater portion of his command. It so happened, however, that the\r\n\"Harris Light,\" originally, be it remembered, forming the vanguard of\r\nKilpatrick's force, was by this manoeuvre thrown round upon the rear,\r\nand Stuart, who was now the pursuer instead of the pursued, had a fine\r\nopportunity of attacking them with his full force, at a great\r\ndisadvantage to the former--an opportunity he was not slow to avail\r\nhimself of.\r\n\r\nKilpatrick's men met the assault manfully, retiring slowly, until at\r\nlength, upon the brow of a small hill, they turned at bay, and for a\r\ntime formed a living rampart between their retreating comrades and the\r\nenemy. Every attempt to approach and penetrate their line proved instant\r\ndeath to their assailants, and General Stuart, seeing no chance of\r\notherwise dislodging them, determined to charge in person, and crush\r\nthem with an entire division. Glazier, who had already emptied two\r\nsaddles, sat coolly upon his horse, reloading as this formidable body\r\ncame sweeping down. By this time, experience of the vicissitudes of a\r\nsoldier's career, and possibly the fact that he had hitherto been very\r\nfortunate in the numerous conflicts in which his regiment had been\r\nengaged, left him quite composed under fire. Singling out one of\r\nStuart's men, he covered that cavalier with his revolver, and probably,\r\nin another instant, would have ended his career; but, just as his finger\r\ngave the final pressure upon the trigger, his horse, riddled with\r\nbullets, fell dead under him, the shot flew wide of its mark, and he\r\nfell to the ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cavalry-fight At New Baltimore--lieutenant Glazier\r\nTaken Prisoner.]\r\n\r\nHis first sensation was of a dense cloud between himself and the sky,\r\nand next of being crushed by tramping hoofs, whole squadrons of horse\r\npassing over his body as he lay prone and helpless. A vague, dreamy\r\nsensation of being a mass of wounds and bruises was succeeded by utter\r\ndarkness and oblivion. How long he continued in this comatose state he\r\nnever knew. Raised from the ground, a terrible sense of acute bodily\r\npain gradually crept over him, as he found himself hurried along at a\r\nrapid pace. Where he was going, who had him in charge, what he had done,\r\nwhether he was in this or some other world, were matters of which he\r\nhad no more conception than the dead charger he had ridden. Pain, pain,\r\nnothing but intense pain, absorbed the whole of his faculties. Gradually\r\nhis full consciousness returned. He remembered the fierce onset of the\r\nenemy, his fall from his horse, and at once concluded that he was a\r\nprisoner in the hands of the enemy! Very soon after, he discovered that,\r\nin addition to being deprived of his arms, he had been stripped of his\r\nwatch and other valuables.\r\n\r\nOne of the great annoyances to which a newly captured prisoner was\r\nsubjected, arose from the fact that skulkers and sneaks, in order to\r\nsecure safe positions, coveted and sought the privilege of quartering\r\nthem. In his own words Glazier says:\r\n\r\n\"The woods in the vicinity were full of skulkers, and, in order to make\r\na show of having something to do, they would make their appearance in\r\nthe rear of the fighting column, and devote themselves sedulously to\r\nguarding the prisoners.\" He adds, that \"privates, corporals and\r\nsergeants, in turn, had them in charge;\" and that \"each in succession\r\nwould call them into line, count them in an officious manner, and issue\r\norders according to their liking,\" until some sneak of higher rank came\r\nalong, assumed the superior command, and in a tone of authority, would\r\nsay to the other poltroons: \"Gentlemen, your services are much needed at\r\nthe front. Go, and do your duty like soldiers.\" The result would be an\r\nexchange of tyrants, but no diminution of the petty tyranny. At dusk the\r\nprisoners were marched to, and lodged in, the jail at Warrenton.\r\n\r\nLike all Federal soldiers who fell into the enemy's hands, Glazier\r\ncomplains very bitterly of the small persecutions inflicted by the\r\nofficers and men of the Home Guard, and unfortunately these mongrels--a\r\ncross between a civilian and a soldier--were their chief custodians\r\nduring that night, and signalized themselves after their fashion. They\r\ndeprived the prisoners of their clothing, and, in truth, everything of\r\nthe slightest value in the eyes of a thief. One of these swashbucklers\r\nattempted to reduce our young hero's wardrobe to an Arkansas basis,\r\nnamely, a straw-hat and a pair of spurs, with what success the following\r\ndialogue, taken mainly from \"The Capture, Prison-Pen, and Escape,\" will\r\nindicate.\r\n\r\n\"Here, Yank,\" said the guard, \"hand me that thar hat, and over-coat, and\r\nboots.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, I won't; they are my property. You have no right to take them\r\nfrom me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have,\" said the guard. \"We have authority from General Stuart to take\r\nfrom you prisoners whatever we d----d choose.\"\r\n\r\n\"That I doubt,\" said the captive, \"and if you are a gentleman you won't\r\nbe guilty of stripping a defenceless prisoner.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll show you my authority, you d----d blue-belly,\" said the ruffian,\r\ndrawing his revolver. \"Now, take off that coat, or I'll blow your brains\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time Glazier's Northern blood was up, and he grew desperate, so\r\nhe angrily answered:\r\n\r\n\"Blow away then! It is as well to be without brains as without\r\nclothing.\"\r\n\r\nSo the fellow, who was evidently a contemptible blusterer, whom General\r\nStuart, had he been aware of his conduct, would have drummed out of the\r\narmy, not willing to risk the consequences of actual violence--sneaked\r\naway.\r\n\r\nWhile this little incident was occurring at Warrenton jail, a very\r\ndifferent event was transpiring at his father's house. His sister was\r\ndying. It was a peaceful, hopeful death--the death of a Christian--of\r\none who in her young life had never by word or deed injured man or\r\nwoman. Many weeks elapsed before her imprisoned brother heard of her\r\ndeath, and when the intelligence at length reached him, he was\r\noverwhelmed with grief at her loss.\r\n\r\nUpon the morning following the day of his capture, in that dense\r\ndarkness that precedes the dawn, the prisoners started on their tramp\r\ntoward Culpepper, and as the day broke, and the sun mounted above the\r\neastern hills, their march, which extended to full thirty miles, became\r\na weary and exhausting journey. Themselves on foot, and compelled to\r\nkeep up with the pace of mounted men, it was a tiresome task; but to do\r\nso under the burning rays of a Southern sun was nearly impossible. To\r\nmake matters worse, in the present case, the Confederates having\r\nsustained a defeat at Bristoe and Rappahannock Station, the guard was\r\nnot in the most amiable humor; in addition to which they were compelled\r\nto use haste in order to avoid capture by the victorious Federals.\r\nGlazier gave no thought to his present discomfort, and to use his own\r\nwords, \"felt relieved when he heard of the successes of his comrades.\"\r\nStill the annoyance of this compulsory tramp was felt keenly. The\r\nprisoners \"being encumbered with heavy high-heeled cavalry boots,\" and\r\ntheir feet having become tender from contact with the mud and water\r\nthrough which they marched, soon became a mass of blisters, and their\r\nsufferings from this cause alone were intense. Six of the poor fellows\r\nsuccumbed, unable to proceed. After a journey attended with much mental\r\ndepression, and bodily agony, the former increased by the barbarous\r\ncontumely flung at them by men who emerged from roadside inns, to stare\r\nat them as they passed, the prisoners, including the subject of our\r\nstory, entered Richmond, and were at once introduced to the amenities of\r\n\"Libby Prison.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIBBY PRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"All ye who enter here abandon hope.\"--Auld lang syne.--Major\r\n    Turner.--Hope deferred maketh the heart sick.--Stoicism.--Glazier\r\n    enters the prison-hospital.--A charnel-house.--Rebel\r\n    surgeons.--Prison correspondence.--Specimen of a regulation\r\n    letter.--The tailor's joke.--A Roland for an Oliver.--News of\r\n    death.--Schemes for escape.--The freemasonry of misfortune.--Plot\r\n    and counter-plot.--The pursuit of pleasure under difficulties.\r\n\r\nIt does not come within the scope of the present work to enter into a\r\ndetailed description of the sufferings of the Union prisoners in this\r\nplace of durance: those who have a taste for such gloomy themes may\r\ngratify it by reading the first work by our young soldier-author,\r\nentitled \"The Capture, Prison-Pen and Escape,\" in which the horrors of\r\nthat house of misery are eloquently described. We may, however, say this\r\nmuch, that if the testimony of eye-witnesses is to be credited, it was a\r\nfearful place, and one over whose portals the words of Dante might have\r\nbeen appropriately inscribed, \"All ye who enter here abandon hope.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Libby Prison.]\r\n\r\nOf some thousand Northern officers confined here, Glazier, of course,\r\nmet several from his own corps, who had been previously captured. He at\r\nfirst felt his condition very acutely. His roving life amid the\r\nmagnificent scenery of Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania was now\r\nexchanged for the gloomy and monotonous routine of a prison; but he\r\nwrites under date of October twenty-eighth, in a more reconciled and\r\nhopeful strain \"I am gradually,\" he says, \"becoming accustomed to this\r\ndungeon life, and I presume I shall fall into the habit of enjoying\r\nmyself at times. 'How use doth breed a habit in a man.' Indeed he can\r\naccommodate himself to almost any clime or any circumstance of life, a\r\ngift of adaptation no other living thing possesses in any such degree.\"\r\nOf one man, in the midst of all his philosophy, our hero speaks very\r\nbitterly. We allude to Major Turner, military warden of the prison. He\r\ndescribes him as possessed of a vindictive, depraved, and fiendish\r\nnature, and moralizes over the man and his career in this wise:\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing more terrible than a human soul grown powerful in sin,\r\nand left to the horrible machinations of the evil one, and its own evil\r\npromptings. Demons developed from germs that might have produced\r\nseraphs, become rank growths, drinking in the healthful stimulants of\r\nlife and reproducing them in hideous forms of vice and crime.\r\n\r\n    \"'Souls made of fire, and children of the sun,\r\n    With whom revenge is virtue.'\r\n\r\n\"Thus we see a soul coming pure and plastic from its Maker's hand, yet\r\nafterward standing before the world, stained and hardened.\"\r\n\r\nSlowly and wearily the days and weeks passed on in \"Libby,\" leaving its\r\ndrear monotony unbroken, except when the rumor of a prospect of being\r\nexchanged came to flush the faces of the captives with a hope destined\r\nnot to be fulfilled while Willard Glazier was in Richmond. The result\r\nwas that he at length abandoned all hope of being exchanged, and for a\r\ntime tried hard to cultivate and \"grow into the luxury of indifference.\"\r\nHis experience told him that \"however reprehensible\" it might be in\r\nordinary life, \"stoicism, under the circumstances in which he then found\r\nhimself, was an actual necessity.\" His mind appears at this time to have\r\nsustained him under many extreme bodily privations. But despite all his\r\nphilosophy and cultivated resignation of spirit, despite the mental\r\nresources which he fortunately possessed in no small degree, and which\r\nenabled him to occupy his time profitably, while others were pacing up\r\nand down the room like caged beasts, feeding upon their own hearts, his\r\nbodily health was materially impaired. The first winter month, with its\r\nfrosty atmosphere, and fierce northern blasts, instead of bringing\r\ninvigoration to his wasted frame, left him more debilitated; and upon\r\nthe eighth of December he succumbed to a disease which had been\r\nencroaching upon him for some time, and requested to be sent to the\r\nhospital. His sensations were far from pleasant when, for the first time\r\nin his life, he found himself seriously ill among enemies, and in that\r\nmost dismal of all dismal places, a Prison Infirmary. \"Once in the\r\nhospital,\" he writes, \"I found myself soon subjected to its peculiar\r\ninfluences. There was the ominous stillness, broken only by the choking\r\ncough, or labored groan; the chilling dread, as though one were in the\r\nimmediate presence of death, and under the ban of silence; and the\r\nanxious yearning--the almost frantic yearning one feels in the\r\ncontemplation of suffering which he is powerless to alleviate. And worse\r\nthan all, at last came the hardened feeling which a familiarity with\r\nsuch scenes produces. This is nothing but an immense charnel-house. We\r\nare constantly in the midst of the dead and dying. Nearly every day some\r\nof our comrades, and on some days several of them, are borne away\r\ncoffinless and unshrouded to their unmarked graves. Nor flower, nor\r\ncross, nor hallowed token, gives grace to the dead, or beauty to the\r\ngrave. I am well aware that in time of war, on the field of carnage, in\r\ncamp, where the pestilential fever rages, or in the crowded prisons of\r\nthe enemy, human life is but little valued. Yet there are moments amidst\r\nall these scenes, when the importance of life and the terrors of death,\r\nseem to force themselves upon the mind of every man, with a power which\r\ncannot be resisted.\"\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant to find that here, as generally in the world with members\r\nof the learned professions, the surgeons were humane and kind; and\r\nremonstrated with the authorities whenever remonstrance on behalf of the\r\npoor sufferers was needed. Of course they could not \"minister to a mind\r\ndiseased, pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,\" or,\r\n\r\n    \"With some sweet oblivious antidote, cleanse\r\n    The choked bosom of that perilous stuff\r\n    That weighs upon the heart;\"\r\n\r\nbut gracious words and sympathizing looks, and the consciousness that he\r\nwas once more in the hands of _gentlemen_, were a source of great\r\ncomfort to the patient, after having been brought into daily and hourly\r\ncontact with the familiars of Major Turner. Another gratifying\r\ncircumstance was, that the Federal surgeons held as prisoners were\r\npermitted to attend upon their sick comrades when they expressed a wish\r\nto do so, and that, of course, was very frequently. Even an hospital has\r\nits little events, which although they appear very trifling in the\r\nretrospect, are of considerable importance at the time of their\r\noccurrence. Here these little episodes were not infrequent. At one time\r\nit was the destruction of a box of dainties sent by the Federal Sanitary\r\nCommission for the prisoners; at another, it was the excitement incident\r\nto an exchange of the surgeons held in captivity; and again, it was the\r\nsurreptitious acquisition by some of the patients of a daily newspaper,\r\nand the guarded dissemination of such items as it might contain among\r\nhis fellow-sufferers; but greatest of all in importance was the receipt\r\nof a letter from HOME. Even when surrounded by all the incidents of home\r\nlife, the postman is ever a welcome visitor; but in the midst of such a\r\ndreary captivity as these men were undergoing, a letter from _home_ was\r\nlike a message from heaven.\r\n\r\nTheir correspondence had, however, its sad as well as its cheerful\r\naspect. The prisoners were restricted in writing their letters to six\r\nlines, by an arbitrary order from Major Turner, and much ingenuity was\r\nexercised in the effort to crowd into these six lines the thousand and\r\none messages which many of the writers desired to send to mothers,\r\nwives, sisters and sweethearts. Here is a genuine specimen of a\r\n\"regulation\" letter from a fond husband to the wife of his bosom:\r\n\r\n     My Dear Wife: Yours received--no hope of exchange--send\r\n     corn-starch--want socks--no money--rheumatism in left\r\n     shoulder--pickles very good--send sausages--God bless you--Kiss the\r\n     baby--Hail Columbia! Your devoted husband,\r\n\r\n                                                               A. D. S.\r\n\r\nBut the \"rule of six\" was successfully evaded for a considerable time,\r\nby the manufacture and use of invisible ink. The trick was however at\r\nlast discovered, and the way in which Glazier tells the story is so\r\namusing, that we are tempted to give it in his own words:\r\n\r\n\"A certain captain writing to a fair and undoubtedly dear friend, could\r\nnot brook the idea of being limited to six lines, when he had so much to\r\ncommunicate; so resorting to the use of invisible ink, he comfortably\r\nfilled the sheet with 'soft and winning words,' and then fearing lest\r\nhis _inamorata_ would not discover the secret he added this postscript:\r\n\r\n\"'P.S.--Now, my dear, read this over, and then bake it in the oven and\r\nread it again.'\r\n\r\n\"This was too much. The rebels thinking if the letter would improve by\r\nbaking it might be well to improve it at once, accordingly held it over\r\nthe fire. This brought to light four closely written pages of the\r\ntenderest and most heart-rending sentiment.\"\r\n\r\nEver after all letters sent out by the prisoners were carefully\r\ninspected and subjected to the \"ordeal by fire,\" so that, to use the\r\nexpressive language of an old soldier, \"that game was played.\"\r\n\r\nAmong Glazier's fellow-prisoners at this time was a certain Major\r\nHalsted. He was one of those social anomalies that are not infrequently\r\nmet with in this country, a man of obscure origin, a member of a very\r\nhumble calling, prior to entering the army, and yet possessing the\r\npersonal appearance and manners of a man of distinction. He really\r\nbelonged to that terribly maligned craft of whose followers it is\r\npopularly said, \"It takes nine to make a man,\"--he was a tailor. Upon\r\nthis fact some of the little wits of the prison, forgetting that one of\r\nthe bravest of Napoleon's generals, and one of the most intrepid of\r\nAmerica's sons, had each followed the same occupation, were in the habit\r\nof jokingly asking him to repair their old and dilapidated clothes.\r\n\r\nWhen this jest was first indulged in, those who knew the undaunted\r\nspirit and somewhat irascible temper of the major, expected to hear him\r\nblaze out upon the perpetrator of the _mauvaise plaisantrie_, or\r\npossibly knock him down. To their surprise, however, he did neither. For\r\na single moment a gleam of passionate wrath shot up in his eyes, but it\r\nwas instantly suppressed, and he joined in the laugh against himself.\r\nSeeing, however, that the victim of the joke did not appear at all\r\ndisturbed or hurt, other, better-natured fellows followed in the wake,\r\nand the jest of asking the major to patch a pair of breeches or mend a\r\ncoat, became somewhat threadbare by repetition.\r\n\r\nIt happened, however, that one day the rebel surgeon accidentally tore\r\nhis coat across the breast, and turning to Major H. said, he would give\r\nhim a bottle of wine if he would repair it. \"Yes, sir,\" said the major,\r\n\"if you will furnish me with a needle, thread, and a few other\r\nindispensables, I will take the whole suit and make it look very\r\ndifferent.\" He added, \"the fact is, I would rather do anything than rust\r\nin idleness in this d----d prison.\" Finding that he spoke seriously, and\r\nas if it were an ordinary business, the Confederate sawbones, who had a\r\nlively appreciation of Yankee handicraft, accepted the offer, and all\r\nnext day the major was hard at work clipping and scouring and pressing\r\nthe surgeon's uniform, every now and then the owner thereof passing by\r\nand smiling approval; and it was remarked that his face wore that\r\ncomplacent expression common to all good men when they have furnished\r\nemployment for idle hands--and it is not going to cost them anything.\r\n\r\nThe same evening, however, when the work, so neatly done, was finished,\r\nthe major very quietly slipped it upon his own dignified person, and\r\ntaking with him a fellow-prisoner as \"hospital steward,\" coolly walked\r\npast the guard, remarking, to the great consternation of that personage,\r\n\"My friend, there are unmistakable indications of _cerebro-spinal\r\nmeningitis_ in your eyes. Come over to the hospital as soon as you are\r\nrelieved, and I will see what can be done for you,\" walked out into the\r\nstreet, and neither he nor the \"hospital steward\" was heard of again\r\nuntil they reached the Federal lines.\r\n\r\nThe devices resorted to, to effect an escape, were as ingenious as they\r\nwere numerous, and for a short time the most popular and successful\r\n_ruse_ was for the prisoners to get into the hospital, simulate death,\r\nand, while left unguarded in the dead-house, to escape. The difference,\r\nhowever, between the tally of the deaths and the burials ultimately\r\nattracted the attention of the authorities, and that was stopped.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that while young Glazier was fighting his last\r\nfight prior to his capture upon the nineteenth of October, the family at\r\nhome were gathered around his sister's dying bed, when her gentle spirit\r\nwinged its flight to Heaven. From that day until the twenty-ninth of\r\nNovember, he had received no news of his family, and consequently, up\r\nto that time, was ignorant of her decease. It had been his habit during\r\nthe weary hours of his prison life, to overcome the tendency to despair\r\nfrom brooding over his misfortunes--which is common to all human beings\r\nin trouble--to fix his thought upon the loved ones at home. His\r\nimagination constantly conjured up pictures of his parents, his sisters\r\nand brothers, and placed them amid the rustic surroundings of his\r\nboyhood's home. Even while in the hospital, and tossing with fever upon\r\nhis bed, the visions which haunted him were not visions of red-handed\r\nwar, but of quiet country life, where his kindred filled their several\r\nspheres of duty. He had never thought of them, except collectively.\r\nAlthough he had, from time to time, felt apprehensive that \"Elvi\" was\r\nsomewhat delicate, he never had the slightest fear that her life was\r\nthereby endangered. Hence, when the sad news arrived, it came as a\r\nterrible surprise. His sisters had been the objects of his peculiar\r\ncare. The relation he had borne to them, young as he was, was that of a\r\nfather, as well as brother. He never wearied of devising plans for their\r\nintellectual improvement. He made it his peculiar care that they should\r\nbe thoroughly educated, and that, while intellectually robust, none of\r\nthe soft down and bloom of true womanhood should be brushed away in the\r\nprocess. They were his memory's \"good angels\" even in sleep; for what\r\nmust have been his dreams in the midst of such surroundings, if he had\r\nnot had them to think of!\r\n\r\nThe shock on thus learning of his sister's death was a very great one to\r\nyoung Glazier, and his reflections for a time were bitter. He alludes\r\nto the subject himself in this way: \"In the very midst of death I am\r\npermitted to drag out a weary life, while dear ones in a land of health,\r\nfreedom and plenty are struck down by the fatal shaft. Her death\r\noccurred on the nineteenth of October, the very day of my capture. I was\r\nthrust into prison, and doubly bound to the groveling discomforts of\r\nearth, while _she_ was released from the prison-house of clay, and\r\nreceived, I believe into the joyous, freedom of Heaven. Our lives are\r\nall in the hands of Him who doeth all things well. He appoints us a\r\nperiod of existence, and appoints a moment to depart. All other\r\ninfluences are subordinate to His will. 'What can preserve our lives,\r\nand what destroy!'\"\r\n\r\nFrom the moment he realized that he was in the hands of the enemy, after\r\nthe battle of New Baltimore, Glazier had made up his mind to exercise\r\nsleepless vigilance in seeking for opportunities of escape. He pondered\r\nover the matter until he became a complete enthusiast in his efforts to\r\nmaster the minute details of the construction and topography of the\r\nplace of his confinement, and, by the exercise of that natural\r\nfreemasonry which enables kindred spirits to recognize each other, soon\r\neffected an understanding upon the subject with certain of the more\r\ndaring of his companions in misfortune. One of these gentlemen was a\r\nLieutenant Tresouthick, an officer of the Eighteenth Pennsylvania\r\nCavalry. In order to comprehend the plan which they finally determined\r\nto carry out, it will be necessary to premise that Libby Prison was a\r\nthree-story structure, built over very ample cellarage; that the stories\r\nwere each divided into three compartments, as was the cellar; and that\r\nthese spaces were all of equal size in length and breadth. For the\r\npurpose of conveying a clear conception of the _locus in quo_ of the\r\nproposed effort, the reader should also be informed that the hospital\r\noccupied the first floor; that Lieutenant Tresouthick was one of the\r\noccupants of the room immediately above it; and that there were sinks\r\nbuilt against the exterior wall of the same height as each story, and\r\nrunning the entire length of the building. The lieutenant's plan was,\r\nthat \"he should feign sickness and get into the hospital,\" says our\r\nhero, in describing the scheme; \"and that I, in the meanwhile, should,\r\nwith a saw-backed knife, cut a board out of the sink large enough to let\r\nus through.\" This looked feasible enough, and the two conspirators were\r\nbeginning to felicitate themselves upon their approaching freedom, when\r\nthey discovered that any such opening as they proposed, would let them\r\nout \"directly opposite the guard,\" so _that_ plan had to be dropped.\r\nGlazier then proposed a plan of operations, promising better and safer\r\nresults. It was, that Tresouthick should still carry out his original\r\nidea of a feigned sickness and consequent admission to the hospital;\r\nthat he (Glazier) should procure a piece of rope, eight or ten feet\r\nlong, and then, \"some dark, rainy night,\" the pair should \"steal down\r\ninto the basement\"--the outer doors of which were \"not locked until ten\r\no'clock\"--and await their opportunity. That, when they once reached the\r\nexterior of the building, and the sentry's back was turned, they should\r\nrush past him on either side, and, with the rope, trip him up, in the\r\nhope of being beyond the reach of his musket before he could fire. This\r\nwas approved by the lieutenant, and they made up their minds to try it.\r\nOf course, it was necessary that Lieutenant Tresouthick's illness should\r\ncome on very gradually, and progress naturally from bad to worse, until\r\nhe became a fit subject for the hospital, so that some time was occupied\r\nin preliminary preparations before any steps could be taken for the\r\nexecution of their plan.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, through the kindness of one of the surgeons, young Glazier\r\nwas furnished with some reading matter, a very great luxury to a man in\r\nhis situation and of his tastes. In his more serious hours he re-read\r\nthe Bible, and committed to memory daily a portion of \"Saint Matthew's\r\nGospel;\" and for relaxation read \"Napoleon and his Marshals.\" This with\r\nan occasional game at chess, checkers, or dominos, games in which the\r\ninvalids were permitted to indulge, made the hours pass much more\r\npleasantly than those spent in the convalescent department. It is true\r\ntheir chess-board was made with chalk upon the floor, the \"men\" being\r\npieces wrought out of bone saved from their soup, and the \"checkers\" old\r\nbuttons ripped from their scanty wardrobe. But these rude implements\r\nafforded as much real sport as if they had been constructed of ivory or\r\ngold. The scene must at all times have been grimly grotesque in this\r\nplace, for all the trades and professions had their representatives\r\nthere, and the lawyers held mock courts, politicians formed caucuses,\r\ngamblers started a square game of faro, and even some ministers of the\r\ngospel gathered together a few of the prisoners each day, who listened\r\nto words of hope and comfort from their lips.\r\n\r\nOn the eighth of December Glazier made this note in his diary: \"Getting\r\ninto the hospital is no easy matter, but Tresouthick is becoming more\r\nand more sick, and has good hopes.\" But\r\n\r\n    \"The best o' plans o' mice and men\r\n    Gang aft aglee;\"\r\n\r\nand all hope of escape for our two worthies was interrupted by the\r\ninconvenient fact that a couple of their comrades anticipated them in\r\npoint of time, and by so doing aroused the guards to such a state of\r\nvigilance, that our over-sanguine boys saw there was no chance for them.\r\nConsequently Lieutenant Tresouthick's illness vanished as it had come,\r\nand he was soon pronounced convalescent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRISON LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Mournful news.--How a brave man dies.--New Year's Day.--Jolly under\r\n    unfavorable circumstances.--Major Turner pays his\r\n    respects.--Punishment for singing \"villainous Yankee\r\n    songs.\"--Confederate General John Morgan.--Plans for\r\n    escape.--Digging their way to freedom.--\"Post No. 1, All's\r\n    well.\"--Yankee ingenuity.--The tunnel ready.--Muscle the trump\r\n    card.--No respect to rank.--_Sauve qui peut!_--A strategic\r\n    movement.--\"Guards! guards!\"--Absentees from\r\n    muster.--Disappointed hopes.--Savage treatment of prisoners.--Was\r\n    the prison mined?\r\n\r\nThe Richmond papers occasionally found their way into the hands of the\r\nprisoners, and the following mournful item of news is transcribed from\r\none of them. The writer of the ensuing letter was a man about thirty\r\nyears of age, who was accused by the rebel authorities of having acted\r\nas a spy on behalf of the Union government. A gloom hung over the prison\r\nfor some days after the reading of the article:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     Castle Thunder, Richmond, Virginia.\r\n\r\n     Dear Father:--By permission and through the courtesy of Captain\r\n     Alexander, I am enabled to write you a few lines. You, who before\r\n     this have heard from me in regard to my situation here, can, I\r\n     trust, bear it, when I tell you that my days on earth are soon\r\n     ended.\r\n\r\n     Last Saturday I was court-martialed, and this evening, a short time\r\n     since, I received notice of my sentence from Captain Alexander,\r\n     who has since shown me every kindness consistent with his duty.\r\n\r\n     Writing to my dear parents, I feel there can be no greater comfort\r\n     after such tidings, than to tell you that I trust, by the mercy of\r\n     our Heavenly Father, to die the death of a Christian.\r\n\r\n     For more than a year, since the commencement of my confinement, I\r\n     have been trying to serve him in my own feeble way, and I do not\r\n     fear to go to Him.\r\n\r\n     I would have loved to see you all again; God saw best not; why\r\n     should we mourn? Comfort your hearts, my dear parents, by thoughts\r\n     of God's mercy unto your son, and bow with reverence beneath the\r\n     hand of Him who \"doeth all things well.\"\r\n\r\n     * * * I sent a ring to my wife by a clergyman, Monday last; I also\r\n     sent a telegram to yourself, which will arrive too late, as the\r\n     time of my execution is set for the day after to-morrow.\r\n\r\n     Dear parents: there are but few more moments left me; I will try to\r\n     think often of you; God bless and comfort you; remember me kindly\r\n     and respectfully to all my dear friends and relatives. Tell Kitty I\r\n     hope to meet her again. Take care of Freddy for me; put him often\r\n     in remembrance of me.\r\n\r\n     Dear mother, good-bye. God comfort you, my mother, and bless you\r\n     with the love of happy children. Farewell, my father; we meet again\r\n     by God's mercy.\r\n\r\n                                                        Spencer Kellogg.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following account of the execution is from a Richmond paper:\r\n\r\n\"At eleven o'clock yesterday forenoon, a detail of one hundred men from\r\nthe City Battalion, marched from Castle Thunder with Spencer Kellogg,\r\nthe recently condemned spy, in custody.\r\n\r\n\"The cavalcade reached the scene of execution about half-past twelve\r\no'clock, where, as usual, a vast concourse of people, of both sexes and\r\nall ages, were congregated. After a few moments spent in preliminary\r\narrangements, the prisoner was escorted, under guard, to the gallows.\r\nWhile seated in the hack awaiting the perfection of the arrangements for\r\nhis execution, he conversed freely with the utmost _nonchalance_ with\r\nDr. Burrows, frequently smiling at some remark made either by himself or\r\nthe minister.\r\n\r\n\"Arriving under the gallows, the charges preferred against the accused\r\nand the sentence of the court-martial were read. A short but impressive\r\nprayer was then offered by the minister, at the conclusion of which the\r\ncondemned man, unaccompanied, mounted the scaffold.\r\n\r\n\"In a few moments Detective Capehart followed, and commenced to adjust\r\nthe rope over the neck of the condemned, in which he assisted, all the\r\nwhile talking with the officer. On taking off his hat, to admit the\r\nnoose over his head, he threw it one side, and falling off the scaffold,\r\nit struck a gentleman beneath, when the prisoner turned quickly, and\r\nbowing, said: 'Excuse me, sir!'\r\n\r\n\"A negro next came on the scaffold with a ladder, and proceeded to\r\nfasten the rope to the upper beam, the prisoner meanwhile regarding him\r\nwith the greatest composure. The rope being fastened, the negro was in\r\nthe act of coming down, when the prisoner, looking up at the rope,\r\nremarked: 'This will not break my neck! It is not more than a foot fall!\r\nDoctor, I wish you would come up and arrange this thing!' The rope was\r\nthen rearranged to his satisfaction, and the cloth cap placed over his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\"The condemned man then bowed his head, and engaged a few seconds in\r\nprayer, at the conclusion of which he raised himself, and standing\r\nperfectly erect, pronounced in a clear voice: 'All ready!'\r\n\r\n\"The drop fell, and the condemned man was launched into eternity!\"\r\n\r\nKellogg is said by his captors to have died with the conviction that he\r\nhad furnished more valuable information, in the character of a spy, to\r\nthe Federal government than any other ten men in the service. But this\r\nhas been denied by his friends at the North, who assert that he was\r\ninnocent of the charge.\r\n\r\nWith baseless rumors of a soon-to-be-effected cartel of exchange; the\r\ndrawing of lots for the selection of hostages, upon whom the Confederacy\r\nproposed to retaliate for the punishment inflicted upon three\r\nConfederates by the Federal authorities who had sentenced them to\r\nimprisonment in the Illinois State Prison; listening to yarns spun by\r\nreal or pretended veterans; playing games of chance; holding spirited\r\ndebates; reading letters from home; occasionally poring over the\r\nnewspaper procured by stealth; or meditating plans of escape--the\r\nbalance of the year 1863 wore on to its close, and still Willard Glazier\r\nwas a prisoner of war, with no prospect whatever of a speedy release.\r\nThen came New-Year's Day, 1864, and some little attempt was made to get\r\nup a New-Year's dinner--though no extra rations had been issued. They\r\ndid their best, however, like Mark Tapley, to be \"jolly under\r\nunfavorable circumstances.\"\r\n\r\nNothing occurred out of the usual routine until the twenty-fourth of\r\nJanuary, when, as the prisoners, including Glazier, were singing \"The\r\nStar-Spangled Banner,\" \"Rally Round the Flag, Boys,\" etc., the door\r\nleading into the street was suddenly flung open, and a squad of armed\r\nmen filed in. Turner was at their head, and quickly crossing the room\r\nand placing himself at the door leading up-stairs, to prevent any of the\r\nprisoners from making their escape, began: \"Now you d----d boisterous\r\nscoundrels, I'll teach you to begin your d----d howling in this building\r\nagain. I want you to understand that you must not drive people crazy out\r\nin the streets with your villainous Yankee songs.\" He then turned to his\r\nmen and ordered them to \"Take their stations around the d----d rascals,\r\nand shoot the first man that dared to stir out of his tracks.\" Having\r\ncompleted which arrangement, he added to his helpless victims: \"Now,\r\nd--n you, stay here until twelve o'clock to-night, and make a bit of\r\nnoise or move from your place, if you dare.\" And he kept them there\r\nuntil the appointed hour, standing and in silence. \"The fires went out\r\nearly in the evening, and the cold became intense. Some managed to get\r\nblankets from their friends,\" in the apartment above, \"but the guards\r\nsoon put a stop to that. One man called down to a friend through a\r\nknot-hole in the floor, asking him if he wanted a blanket. The guard\r\nheard him, cocked his gun, and aimed at the hole; but a call from below\r\ngave the man warning and he fled.\" And all this for singing a song\r\nwritten by a Southerner, in praise of the flag under whose aegis Major\r\nTurner was nurtured and received his military education! It is quite\r\npossible that a song identified with the cause of their supposed enemy\r\nmight have produced a commotion among the ignorant rabble in the street,\r\nand hence it is perhaps unfair to blame the commander of the prison for\r\nprohibiting the loud singing, which partook somewhat of the nature of\r\ndefiance; but he could certainly have attained his object as effectually\r\nin a manner becoming an officer and a gentleman. Even the victims of the\r\nFirst French Revolution were permitted to express in song through the\r\nbars of the Temple sentiments of utter scorn for their enemies, and\r\nwhen the Jacobins in their turn marched to the guillotine they did so,\r\nsinging the \"Marseillaise.\"\r\n\r\nA great sensation was created among the prisoners on the twenty-fifth of\r\nthe month on account of a visit made to \"Libby\" by the famous raider,\r\nGeneral John Morgan, whom Glazier describes as a \"large, fine-looking\r\nofficer, wearing a full beard and a rebel uniform, trimmed with the\r\nusual amount of gold braid;\" but something far more interesting than the\r\nvisit of any man, however famous, began to absorb the attention of our\r\nimprisoned hero at this time. He had never ceased to rack his brain with\r\nschemes looking to his escape. A life of captivity was indescribably\r\nwearisome to him. He not only taxed his own ingenuity in the effort to\r\ndiscover some feasible plan, but eagerly entered into the schemes of\r\nothers. The result, however, so far as he was individually concerned,\r\nwas by no means in accordance with his hopes; but, as he has given the\r\ndetails in his \"Capture, Prison-Pen, and Escape,\" we cannot do better\r\n(even at the risk of quoting from that work more freely than we had\r\nintended) than to let our readers have it in his own words, thus:\r\n\r\n\"Early in the winter, Colonel Thomas E. Rose, of the Seventy-seventh\r\nPennsylvania Volunteers, conceived a plan of escape, and organized a\r\nsecret company of twenty-seven, who were to dig their way to freedom.\r\n\r\n\"Colonel Rose was well calculated to superintend this work, for he had\r\nserved in the Mexican War, was taken prisoner by the Mexicans, and after\r\na short confinement, escaped by tunneling from the prison a sufficient\r\ndistance to be clear of the guards. He had served his apprenticeship\r\nand was now prepared to manage and direct. After thorough organization\r\nof our company, with secrecy well enjoined, we adopted the following\r\nplan of operations:\r\n\r\n\"In the basement of the building just below our cook-room, was a small\r\nunoccupied cellar, which had been closed since our arrival, and was\r\nnever entered. From this room or cellar arose a large chimney, which\r\npassed through the cook-room, and so to the top of the building. Our\r\nfirst work was to make a hole in the chimney from the kitchen, which\r\nopening we could easily conceal by means of some slop-barrels. These\r\nbarrels we managed ourselves to empty, so that all danger of detection\r\nfrom this point was carefully avoided. A short ladder which our\r\nconsiderate jailers had brought into the rooms for the purpose of\r\nraising their flag on the building, was used to make our descent into\r\nthe dark room below. Inquiry was made for the ladder, but as no one\r\nseemed to know anything about it, it was inferred that it had been\r\nconverted into fuel. At the foot of the ladder another opening was made\r\nthrough the chimney wall leading into the underground basement room. By\r\nremoving a few stones from the wall of this place, we were in a\r\nsituation to commence the work of tunneling. The only implements in our\r\npossession were an old trowel and the half of a canteen. The arduous\r\nlabor was commenced with only the fragment of a canteen, but with this\r\nthe progress was so slow that even the most patient were disheartened.\r\nFortunately for us a mason came in to repair the prison walls, and going\r\nto dinner before he had finished his work, left his trowel, which in his\r\nabsence most mysteriously disappeared. To him it may have been of\r\nlittle account, to us it was a godsend. With the aid of this implement\r\nwe were enabled to make more rapid progress, were greatly encouraged,\r\nand worked night and day with ceaseless energy. Two of our number were\r\nkept in the tunnel almost constantly. One, by a vigorous use of the\r\ntrowel and canteen, would advance slowly, placing the loosened earth in\r\nan old blanket, which the other would convey out of the tunnel into a\r\ncorner of the room, from whence it started. Our course was due east,\r\nunder the street, where constantly paced the sentinels, who at every\r\nhour of the night were wont to cry: 'Post No. 1; all's well!'--'Post No.\r\n2; all's well!' etc. Little did they dream that Yankee ingenuity and\r\nperseverance were perforating the solid earth under their feet, and\r\nopening a path to freedom.\r\n\r\n\"As we progressed in our work we experienced great difficulty from the\r\nwant of pure air to breathe, and to sustain our candles, which refused\r\nto burn. Consequently, one of our party was compelled to stand at the\r\nopening, fanning pure air into the tunnel with his hat. Our atmospheric\r\ndifficulties were the more increased by the small size of the hole,\r\nwhich was a little less than two feet in diameter, quite irregular in\r\nconsequence of large stones, and descended in a line below the\r\nhorizontal. This severe labor was carried on without much interruption\r\nfor more than three weeks, when, at last, the plan came near being a\r\nfailure on account of a sad mistake in our measurement. Our intention\r\nwas to reach the yard of an old shed, or warehouse, in which were then\r\nstored the boxes sent us by the Christian and Sanitary Commissions, and\r\nby our friends at the North.\r\n\r\n\"Thinking we had reached the desired point, an opening was made to the\r\nsurface, when it was found we were still in the street, outside the\r\nfence, and within a few yards of the sentries. Not discovered by this\r\nmishap, the hole was quickly filled with a pair of old pants and some\r\nstraw, and the work of excavation continued to the spot intended.\r\n\r\n\"The selection of this point was very fortunate, as the guards used to\r\nskulk about this building at night for the purpose of plundering the\r\nboxes, and on the night of the escape, as it happened, they saw every\r\nman that came out; but, supposing them to be friends, only whispered to\r\neach other, that 'the boys were going through the _Yankee boxes_ mighty\r\nfast.'\r\n\r\n\"These whisperings,\" adds Captain Glazier, \"were distinctly heard by\r\nsome of our men. The tunnel was about sixty-five feet in length, and was\r\nready for use February ninth, 1864.\r\n\r\n\"The company of diggers had arranged that they should make their egress\r\nfirst, and inform the others just as they were going out. But each man\r\nhad a particular friend whom he wished to notify, and, as we were seen\r\npacking our clothing, it soon became suspected among our\r\nfellow-prisoners that something unusual was in the wind. Curiosity, once\r\non the alert, soon discovered the secret, and then all were jubilant\r\nwith the hope of escape, and forthwith commenced packing their poor\r\nwardrobes. But egress was so slow that it soon became evident to the\r\ncool calculator that, at best, but a comparatively small proportion of\r\nour number would be fortunate enough to take their departure from\r\n'Libby' before daylight would forbid any further efforts in that\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n\"In order to get down the chimney, as well as along the tunnel, it was\r\nnecessary to do so _in puris naturalibus_, wrap our clothing in a\r\nbundle, and push it on before us. As soon as it was seen that only a few\r\ncould possibly get out, many, and in fact most, became selfish, and\r\nthought only of attaining their own liberty. All rushed for the mouth of\r\nthe tunnel, each man seemingly determined to be first out. By this\r\nmovement, the organization formed by the pioneers or working party was\r\nbroken up, and the workmen, who were to have had the first opportunity\r\nto escape, were not more favorably situated than those who had never\r\nborne a hand in the digging. At the entrance to the tunnel were hundreds\r\neagerly awaiting their turn.\r\n\r\n\"Through the intense anxiety and excitement that arose, there was a rush\r\nand a crowd, each one being eager to improve the opportunity. Muscle was\r\nthe trump card, and won. The weak had to step aside, or rather they were\r\npushed aside without apology. No respect was paid to rank or name. A\r\nlong-armed second lieutenant had no scruple in taking hold of a pair of\r\nshoulders that wore eagles, and pushing them out of the way. It was\r\n_sauve qui peut_, and no standing aside for betters--no deference to\r\nage, and gray hairs ceased to be honored. Mere physical force was the\r\ntest of championship. Those poor weak ones who gravitated to the\r\noutskirts of such an eager crowding mass--just as the light kernels will\r\nfind their way to the top of a shaken measure of wheat--doubtless\r\nthought, as they felt themselves crowded further and further from the\r\ndoor of egress:\r\n\r\n                    \"'Oh, it is excellent\r\n    To have a giant's strength, but 'tis tyrannous\r\n    To use it like a giant!'\r\n\r\n\"I made several attempts,\" Glazier continues, \"to assert what I\r\nconsidered my rights, but as I had not, at that time, much muscle to\r\nback my claims, they were not recognized, and thus I spent the whole\r\nnight in a bootless struggle for freedom.\r\n\r\n\"In digging the tunnel we had encountered a large root which we could\r\nnot well remove, and the passage at this point was very narrow.\r\nLieutenant Wallace F. Randolph, Fifth United States Artillery, a\r\ncorpulent fellow, was caught fast by the root. There was a man before\r\nhim, and another behind, which almost entirely excluded atmospheric\r\ncirculation, and before they could pull him out of his unfortunate\r\npredicament, Randolph was almost dead. He was, however, successful at\r\nlast. This blockade greatly retarded the line of march, and made the\r\ncrowd within still more desperate.\r\n\r\n\"Some of the outsiders in the struggle, who despaired of accomplishing\r\nanything by strength, had recourse to a stratagem. There had been\r\nconsiderable noise during the struggle for position, and the guards were\r\nexpected to make their appearance at any moment. The outsiders, taking\r\nadvantage of this apprehension, went to the farther end of the\r\ncook-room, and, in the darkness, made a racket with pots and kettles,\r\nwhich sounded very much like the clashing of fire-arms; while some of\r\ntheir number in the crowd sang out: 'Guards! guards!' In an instant\r\nevery man was gone from the tunnel, and a frantic rush took place for\r\nthe single stairway by about five hundred men. Such a struggling and\r\npressing I have never elsewhere seen, or participated in. We neither\r\nwalked up, nor ran up, but were literally lifted from our feet, and\r\npropelled along in a solid mass up the passage, and made our entrance\r\nthrough the door at the head of the stairs as though shot from a\r\ncannon--most of us not stopping until we struck the wall on the opposite\r\nside of the room. While this was going on, the scamps who had given the\r\nfalse alarm were quietly passing out of the tunnel! The _ruse_ was soon\r\ndiscovered, however, and, in a few minutes, there was as great a jam at\r\nthe entrance of the tunnel as ever. But, so eager and unthinking were\r\nwe, that within half an hour, the same trick was played on us again by\r\nothers and then followed another stampede up the stairs. It is a wonder\r\nthis affair was not stopped by the guards, but they had no suspicion\r\nwhatever of what was going on. This was probably owing to the fact that\r\ngreat noises in the cook-room were common throughout the night as well\r\nas day. It is however reported that one of the sentinels was heard to\r\ncall out jocosely to a comrade on the next beat, 'Hello, Billy! there\r\ngoes somebody's coffee-pot, sure.'\r\n\r\n\"This struggle continued until morning, when the opening in the chimney\r\nwas covered, and we went to our several quarters. Here a muster was\r\ncalled to discover how many had made their escape, when it was found\r\nthat one hundred and fifteen were missing. Arrangements were at once\r\nmade to account for their absence, and certain men were designated who\r\nwere to cross the room slyly during roll-call, and be counted twice.\r\n\r\n\"For some reason the authorities were late that morning, and did not\r\nmake their appearance until about ten o'clock. On the roll being called\r\nthe men, according to arrangement, attempted to cross the room, but the\r\nmovement was discovered, and so the count showed one hundred and fifteen\r\nshort. The clerk thought he had made a mistake, and counted again, but\r\nwith the same result. The authorities also thought there must be some\r\nerror in the count, and joked little Ross, the prison clerk, who was\r\nnone of the brightest, because he could not count a thousand Yankees!\r\n\r\n\"We were now marched from one room to another, and counted one by one,\r\nbut still there were one hundred and fifteen short of the complement.\r\nWe, of course, pretended to be as much surprised as the authorities.\r\nThey next sent for Major Turner, and he counted us two or three times,\r\nbut with an equally unsatisfactory result. He demanded of us where they\r\nhad gone, and how they got out; but not a man knew.\r\n\r\n\"The escape was at once made public, and the papers were filled with the\r\nnews, and the most strenuous measures at once adopted to ensure the\r\nrecapture of the runaways. The authorities were terribly exasperated,\r\nand as a first step, arrested the guards and threw them into Castle\r\nThunder, concluding as a matter of course, that they had been bribed.\r\nThis set the guards thinking, and one of them remembered he had seen an\r\nunusual number of men in the lot near the Yankee boxes. Latouche, the\r\nprison adjutant, hearing of this, just before nightfall discovered the\r\nlocality of the opening. Next, they questioned the prisoners as to\r\n_where_ in the building it began, but could obtain no satisfaction, and\r\nnot until after a long search, did they discover the opening in the\r\nchimney.\"\r\n\r\nSo the \"patient toil and vigil long\" of poor Glazier went for nothing.\r\nThe Confederate authorities seem to have treated the matter very\r\ngood-humoredly, frankly expressed their surprise at the ingenuity and\r\npatience of the subterranean engineers, and manfully set about the task\r\nof recapturing the fugitives. Forty-eight were brought in during the\r\nnext two days, but at the same time it leaked out among the prisoners\r\nthat the Unionists under General Kilpatrick were within the outer line\r\nof fortifications, engaging the rebels, as it was conjectured, with the\r\nview of rescuing the prisoners. The consequence was, there was much\r\nexcitement among the latter, for the boom of cannon sounded distinctly\r\nin their ears, and that sound was accepted as the music that heralded\r\ntheir approaching freedom.\r\n\r\nAll such hopes, however, were doomed to disappointment. The object of\r\nthe expedition, which was a combined movement from different points by\r\nGeneral Kilpatrick and Colonel Dahlgren, was defeated in consequence of\r\nthe treachery of a negro guide, employed by the latter officer, and one\r\nof the effects of this man's treason was the death of that gallant young\r\nsoldier. The only result that followed to the prisoners was that the\r\nrebels became more exasperated than ever, and unfortunately for their\r\nreputation, they seem, with regard to the treatment of the few prisoners\r\nthat fell into their hands on this occasion, to have behaved rather like\r\nsavage than civilized people. Not satisfied with the perpetration of\r\nacts of cruelty upon these particular prisoners, they (according to\r\nCaptain Glazier's information) undermined the prison building, and\r\nstored beneath the foundation a sufficient quantity of powder to blow it\r\ninto fragments. This proceeding he says they called, with more force\r\nthan elegance, \"preparing the Yankees for hell;\" and Major Turner\r\nvery grimly informed them that if any further attempt at escape were\r\nmade, or efforts for their rescue, the prison would be blown to atoms!\r\nIt is not surprising that at such a time, and under the circumstances,\r\nthe prisoners looked upon this threat as meant in sober reality; but in\r\nall probability (or at least let us hope), it was used simply as a means\r\nof discouraging attempts upon the part of the incarcerated men, to\r\nregain their liberty by their own efforts or that of their friends.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Hole In The Floor.]\r\n\r\nThe raiders captured in the expedition under Kilpatrick and Dahlgren had\r\nbeen thrust into a cell directly beneath the room in which Glazier was\r\nconfined. Contrivances were made to open communication with them for the\r\npurpose, if possible, of alleviating their sufferings, as it was well\r\nknown that food was issued to them in very niggardly quantities, and\r\nevery indignity the rebels could devise inflicted upon them. After much\r\neffort, by the aid of a knife, a hole was cut in the floor, sufficiently\r\nlarge to pass a man's hand, and through this hole Glazier, for several\r\nweeks, was instrumental in furnishing the captives with a share of his\r\nown and his companions' rations, which were eagerly grasped and devoured\r\nby the starving men. No single act of our hero's life afforded him more\r\nreal happiness than the service he was thus enabled to render the brave\r\nmen who had lost their liberty in the noble effort to capture the prison\r\nand release its inmates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nDANVILLE.--MACON.--SAVANNAH.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Belle Boyd, the Confederate spy.--National characteristics.--\r\n    Colonel Mosby.--Richmond to Danville.--Sleeping spoon-fashion.--\r\n    Glazier's \"corrective point\" suffers.--Saltatory entrance to a\r\n    railroad car.--Colonel Joselyn.--Sympathy of North Carolinians.--\r\n    Ingenious efforts to escape.--Augusta.--Macon.--Turner again!--\r\n    \"Carelessness\" with firearms.--Tunneling.--Religious revival.--\r\n    Order from Confederate War Department.--Murder!--Fourth of\r\n    July.--Macon to Savannah.--Camp Davidson.--More tunneling.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Confederate spy, Belle Boyd, paid a visit to \"Libby\" in\r\nthe latter part of March, and her presence created much comment among\r\nthe prisoners. She was not that ideal of grace and gentleness which\r\n\r\n                       \"Untutored youth,\r\n    Unlearned in the world's false subtleties,\"\r\n\r\nenthrones within the temple of his heart, but was, notwithstanding, a\r\nremarkable woman. With much of the enthusiasm that characterized \"_La\r\nPucelle_,\" she appears to have combined a considerable allowance of\r\nshrewdness, or common sense; a mixture of qualities, by the way, of more\r\ncommon occurrence than is generally supposed, among the northern and\r\nsouthern people of our continent. There is little difference between the\r\n\"peartness\" of the one, and the \"smartness\" of the other; or the \"high\r\ntone\" of the South, and the _nonchalance_ of the North. The common\r\n_national_ characteristic of the people of both sections, however, is\r\nthe power of adapting themselves to every variety of circumstance. No\r\nmatter what the importance, or the insignificance of the occasion, or\r\nevent, upon which they perceive that their opportunity for the\r\nattainment of a desired object depends, they are ready at the right\r\nmoment to seize and turn it to account; and while, to-day, the banks of\r\nthe Ganges or the Tigris are made to yield up to them the fruits of\r\ntheir industry and produce, to-morrow, when a modification of the law of\r\ndemand and supply prevails, we find the same men following the tide of\r\nfortune through humbler but equally useful channels. We are\r\npre-eminently a practical people, and that this characteristic to some\r\nextent destroys the poetic aspect of American life, cannot be gainsaid.\r\nThe homes of our infancy, the graves of our kindred, the hills upon\r\nwhose summits we first felt the glory of the morning, the altar at which\r\nwe first knelt in prayer, the rustic nook where we listened for the one\r\nstep to which our boyish hearts beat sweetest time; have no power to\r\ntrammel our migratory proclivities, or to check our local inconstancy.\r\nThe sentiments with which such objects are indissolubly connected, are\r\nbut tendrils clinging round the parent nest, and the wings of the\r\nnew-fledged bird, bursting them asunder, it soars out into the world to\r\ncontend and battle with its storms.\r\n\r\nOne of the least attractive illustrations of this spirit of unrest, is\r\nwhere it extends to our women, and Miss Belle Boyd's is in our\r\nestimation a case in point.\r\n\r\n    \"Unknown to her the rigid rule,\r\n      The dull restraint, the chiding frown,\r\n    The weary torture of the school;\r\n      The taming of wild nature down.\r\n    Her only lore, the legends told\r\n      Around the soldiers' fire; at night\r\n    Stars rose and set, and seasons rolled;\r\n      Flowers bloomed, and snowflakes fell,\r\n        Unquestioned, in her sight!\"\r\n\r\nHer career was full of adventure and intrepid daring, and she served the\r\ndisloyal cause she espoused faithfully and to the bitter end; and then,\r\nlike other wandering stars of the troubled sky, sank into oblivion. From\r\nthe time of Miss Boyd's visit until the seventh of May, Willard Glazier\r\ncontinued to lead the same dull life at Libby Prison. The monotony of\r\nthe hours was unbroken by any circumstance more exciting than a visit\r\nfrom the celebrated partisan chief, Mosby, who is described by Glazier\r\nas a _preux chevalier_, at that time about twenty-eight years of age, in\r\nfigure slight, with straight fair hair and closely shaven face, except\r\nthat \"a faded German moustache overshadowed his upper lip.\" It does not\r\nappear that he was received as a welcome visitor, although he jocularly\r\nremarked to some of the prisoners who had been captured by his own\r\ntroopers that he was \"glad to see them there.\"\r\n\r\nTime! what wonders dost thou work. But a few years have passed, and\r\nMosby, who was erst so malignant a rebel, that even the poor, but loyal,\r\nprisoners, presented him the cold shoulder, is now a confidential friend\r\nof the late Commander in chief of the Union Army! Longstreet, the rebel\r\nGeneral, again swears by the Star-Spangled Banner; and Beauregard, hero\r\nof Sumter and Bull Run, is now an advocate of perfect equality between\r\nthe black and white races in his Southern State of Louisiana!\r\n\r\nThe visit of Colonel Mosby was the last memorable incident of our\r\nhero's sojourn in \"Libby.\" Upon the seventh of May following, the\r\nprisoners were removed thence to Danville, Virginia. Several, in the\r\ncourse of this transit, effected their escape, but the great majority\r\nwere safely conveyed to their new place of imprisonment. The change made\r\nno improvement in their unhappy condition. True, the rations furnished\r\nat Danville were of somewhat better quality, and more liberal in\r\nquantity, but the discipline was equally Draconian, and the penalty of\r\nits slightest infraction--death! The chief source of misery among the\r\ncaptives was want of room, the men being compelled to sleep\r\n\"spoon-fashion,\" and in detachments, many being compelled to stand up\r\nawake while their comrades slept as best they could.\r\n\r\nThis condition of things, however, did not last long. Early upon the\r\nmorning of the twelfth, the prisoners were once more marched out and\r\nstarted southward. After a journey of twenty-four hours in cattle cars,\r\nexposed most of the time to a drenching rain, they were disembarked and\r\ntramped another twelve miles to Greensboro. Here the mass of weary, wet,\r\nand hopeless patriots were about to be driven, pell-mell, like a herd of\r\ncattle, into a train of filthy cars, when young Glazier thought he\r\nespied a chance of evading his captors. He waited until it appeared to\r\nhim that the guard was sufficiently occupied with other duties to\r\noverlook his whereabouts, and then slipped behind a log, where in an\r\ninstant he lay upon the ground apparently fast asleep, trusting in the\r\nconfusion attendant upon the departure of the train to escape\r\nobservation. But fortune was against him. The only result was the\r\ninfliction upon that portion of his body which some mothers consider\r\nthe \"corrective point\" of their children, of sundry unceremonious kicks,\r\nwhich, coming from such boots as the \"C. S. A.\" at that time supplied to\r\ntheir soldiers, were felt to be more persuasive than agreeable. Of\r\ncourse it became necessary to awaken from his profound slumber slowly,\r\nwhich made the _kicks_ still more persuasive, and by the time he was\r\nerect, the cars were filled and the doors all closed. The guards\r\ntherefore insisted upon his effecting an entrance through the small\r\nwindow, which he did with certain vigorous assistance from behind, and\r\nlanded upon the head and shoulders of Lieutenant-Colonel Joselyn, of the\r\nFifteenth Massachusetts Infantry, who passed him around in such a way\r\nthat the other occupants of the car were moved to sundry objurgations at\r\nthe expense of our young friend more forcible than polite, and partaking\r\nlittle of the nature of a hospitable reception! However, this is a world\r\nof compromises, and Glazier soon found his level among his\r\nfellow-captives.\r\n\r\nTheir route took them through a portion of North Carolina, where for the\r\nfirst time they met with unmistakable proofs of sympathy. At one city,\r\non learning there were \"Yankee prisoners\" in town, the citizens came out\r\nin large numbers. Many attempted to converse with them, but were forced\r\nback at the point of the bayonet. The prisoners then struck up the\r\n\"Star-Spangled Banner,\" and \"Rally Round the Flag,\" and in each\r\ninterlude could see white handkerchiefs waving in the breeze,\r\ndemonstrations that so exasperated the Virginia guard that they sent a\r\ndetail to drive \"the d----d tar-heels\" from the field.\r\n\r\nThe contiguity of friends of course presented a strong temptation to\r\nsome to strike for liberty. Every device promising the least chance\r\nof escape was therefore resorted to. Among the most ingenious of these\r\nwas one so graphically described by young Glazier that we make no\r\napology for again using his language:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Prison Pen, Macon, Georgia. Tunneling--the\r\nNarrow Path To Freedom.]\r\n\r\n\"The night being very dark,\" he writes, \"and the soil where we were\r\nhuddled together very sandy and light, many of the prisoners dug holes\r\nin the ground and there buried themselves, hoping thus to escape the\r\nobservation of the guard when we should be marched from the field to the\r\ncars. Unfortunately, however, the scheme was exposed by one of the guard\r\nwho accidentally stumbled into one of the holes, in the bottom of which\r\nhe beheld a 'live Yankee.' Struck with amazement, he shouted out: 'Oh,\r\nmy G--, Captain, here is a Yankee buried alive!' Great excitement was\r\nthe natural consequence. A general search ensued, torch-lights were\r\nused, and the trees and ground thoroughly inspected. This investigation\r\nbrought to light several holes of a similar character, each having\r\ndeposited therein a Federal prisoner. The guards were very angry and\r\nwent about shouting, 'Run them through! Pick up the d----d hounds!' but\r\ntheir captain, a good-natured sort of man, stopped all this. 'No,' said\r\nhe, 'the d----d Yankees have a right to escape if they can. Let them\r\nalone. I'll risk their getting away from me!'\"\r\n\r\nSome of the burrowers did escape, however, and several others hid\r\nthemselves in the foliage and were left behind.\r\n\r\nAfter this nothing eventful occurred upon the way, and on the fifteenth\r\nof the same month, the whole party arrived at Augusta, Georgia, and\r\nfound the home guards, to whose custody they were consigned, a bad lot.\r\nFrom that city they were soon after removed to Macon. Up to this\r\nperiod, amid all the mortifications of their condition, notwithstanding\r\ntheir tiresome rides and weary marches; despite the chagrin they\r\nnaturally felt when well-laid plans of escape were frustrated by\r\naccidents beyond the power of men to foresee, they still had one source\r\nof consolation--there was at least one drop of balm in Gilead--_for had\r\nthey not gotten rid of--Turner!_\r\n\r\nJudge, then, of their mingled horror and despair when they reached the\r\nfront gate of Camp Oglethorpe, their future prison, to find that monster\r\nbefore them, lounging gracefully against the gate entrance, and\r\nevidently delighted with the idea of being in a condition to shock his\r\nformer victims with his presence.\r\n\r\nThe laugh, however, was not entirely his, for, upon mustering them, he\r\ndiscovered that forty-seven had escaped. Smothering his wrath for the\r\nmoment, he welcomed the remainder to their prison-house, with the\r\ngratifying intelligence that _it had its dead-line_, and all who\r\napproached it had better be ready to meet the contingencies of a future\r\nstate of rewards and punishments!\r\n\r\nAfter horrifying them with his presence, he shortly took himself off,\r\nand not long afterward, to their great relief, was ordered back to\r\nRichmond.\r\n\r\nBefore the week had expired, Glazier had an opportunity of estimating\r\nhow _careless_(_?_) some of his custodians were in handling their\r\nfirearms, being an eye-witness of an attempt by a sentinel to shoot\r\nLieutenant Barker, of the First Rhode Island Cavalry. The bullet, kinder\r\nthan the boy who sped it on its errand (for this guard was not over\r\nfourteen years of age), passed over the old man's head. As the latter\r\nnoted the direction of the lad's aim, and heard the whistle of the\r\nbullet above him, he very temperately asked the somewhat unnecessary\r\nquestion, \"What are you shooting at?\" \"I am shooting at you, you d----d\r\nold cuss.\" \"What are you shooting at me for?\" mildly inquired the\r\nlieutenant. \"Because you had your hands on the dead-line,\" answered the\r\nboy. At this moment the sergeant of the guard came up, and taking the\r\nprecocious ruffian by the collar, shook him with considerable energy,\r\nand demanded of him very fiercely, \"What the devil are you shooting at\r\nthat prisoner for, you little scoundrel?\" The boy replied that the\r\nprisoner had his hands on the dead-line. Whereupon the sergeant shook\r\nhim again, told him he was a liar--that the lieutenant was not within\r\ntwenty feet of the dead-line, and consigned him to the custody of the\r\ncorporal of the guard, who marched the young monster away.\r\n\r\nCaptain Glazier states that he was within ten feet of the lieutenant\r\nwhen the shot was fired, and that the latter _was not within thirty feet\r\nof the fatal line_. The incident was not very exhilarating upon the\r\nthreshold of his new abode, and the prisoners naturally felt greatly\r\nexasperated when they heard the particulars.\r\n\r\nAn order was promulgated next morning by the officer commanding, Captain\r\nW. K. Tabb, directing that \"any of their number not in ranks at\r\nroll-call should be shot,\" which was not calculated to make them think\r\nmore kindly of their jailers. The fact is, that the prisoners, in\r\npursuance of a settled determination to lose no opportunity of escape\r\nthat seemed at all feasible, had been again making experiments in\r\n_tunneling_, and this atrocious order was intended as a measure of\r\nprecaution against similar schemes in future.\r\n\r\nThus excluded from the relief afforded by such hopeful occupation, their\r\npoor captives had to find other employment for their leisure hours, and\r\nat this time a kind of religious revival took place among them, and if\r\nhuman prayer could have effected the destruction of the Confederacy,\r\nthat organization would certainly have crumbled into dust forthwith. The\r\nenthusiasm was so great that at times the exercises bordered upon\r\ntumult, and greatly incensed their less fervent guards. At one time a\r\nhuge Western man poured forth such a rhapsody in favor of Grant and\r\nSherman, and garnished it with such pungent denunciations of Jefferson\r\nDavis, and other Confederate magnates, that one of the jailers commented\r\nthus: \"D----d smart praying, but it won't do! It won't do!\"\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the tenth of August, an order from the Confederate War\r\nDepartment was read before the entire garrison of Camp Oglethorpe, and\r\ncaused much excitement. This order directed that a detachment of fifty\r\nprisoners, selected from officers of the highest rank, should be\r\nforwarded to Charleston, in order that they might be placed under the\r\nfire of the siege guns with which the beleaguering Union forces were\r\nattempting the reduction of that city. The order further directed that\r\nGenerals Scammon, Wessels, Seymour, Schuyler and Heckman should be\r\nincluded in the number. The mandate was of course at once executed, and\r\nthe departure of the devoted band was the signal for a wild burst of\r\nindignant reprobation of the Confederate authorities. It happened also,\r\nat this time, that one of the sentinels shot and mortally wounded a\r\nprisoner. The victim's name was Otto Grierson, and he had been a general\r\nfavorite. The excuse assigned for the murder was that he was\r\nendeavoring to escape, but his comrades declared that at the time the\r\nshot was fired, he was fully sixteen feet from the dead-line, and had\r\nmade no attempt to escape. Young Glazier and others joined in a formal\r\nreport of the facts to the officer in command, but the only result was\r\nthat the murderer received promotion, and was granted a furlough!\r\n\r\nIf the statements of Captain Glazier regarding this and other\r\ncontemporaneous outrages are to be relied upon (and he is very strongly\r\ncorroborated), the officers commanding this military prison sadly abused\r\ntheir trust. Even the highest of those officials indulged in such petty\r\nexhibitions of puerile spite as to be altogether unworthy of his\r\nstation, or even the name of an American.\r\n\r\nOn the arrival of the Fourth of July, the prisoners very naturally\r\ndetermined, as far as their limited resources would permit, to celebrate\r\nthe occasion. Accordingly, in true American fashion, a meeting was\r\ncalled, at which speeches of a patriotic character were made, songs\r\nsung, and a miniature flag, containing the full number of stars and\r\nstripes, which one of their number had concealed about his person, was\r\nproduced, and became an object of much interest. Instead of\r\nmagnanimously ignoring all this harmless enthusiasm, the commander of\r\nthe prison marched in a company of guards and violently dispersed the\r\nmeeting!\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-seventh of July, six hundred prisoners were counted out,\r\nas they supposed to be added to the others under fire at Charleston, but\r\nreally for removal to Camp Davidson, at Savannah, Georgia.\r\n\r\nThis change proved for the better. In the first place, in lieu of the\r\nSahara of shadeless sand and clay of their former prison grounds, they\r\nfound at \"Davidson\" a number of fine oaks, beneath the shade of which\r\nthey were permitted to recline in peace. In addition to this, and a\r\nmatter of infinitely greater importance, their guards were officered by\r\n_gentlemen_. Captain Glazier states that the authorities here issued\r\ntents, cooking utensils, and decent rations, and adds this tribute to\r\ntheir generally manly conduct toward the prisoners: \"The troops here\r\nhave seen service, and there is nothing like the battle-field and the\r\nsuffering there experienced to teach soldiers humanity toward each\r\nother. Whenever attempts are made to escape, they give us to understand\r\nthat they would do the same themselves, under like circumstances, but\r\nare still compelled to punish such infractions of discipline. They\r\npolitely ask our pardon for inspecting our quarters, and in a manner as\r\ngentlemanly as possible, remove our blankets from the floor of our tents\r\nin their search for incipient _tunnels_. All this is very gratifying and\r\ntends to assuage the bitter hatred which former brutality has\r\nengendered. These Georgia boys will be long remembered, and may look for\r\nthe utmost kindness and consideration from us if the chances of war ever\r\nreverse our situations.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a record for Georgia nobler far than any she ever gained upon\r\nthe battle-field, albeit her sons were always in the van. All honor to\r\nthem! Such victories are well worth the winning.\r\n\r\nBut pleasant as their Georgia quarters were by comparison with former\r\nexperiences, the captives were afflicted with the _malade du pays_--the\r\nhome-sickness that tugged at their hearts, and bade them again and\r\nagain risk death for the chance of freedom. Tunnel after tunnel was\r\nattempted, and one, constructed by a select band (sworn to secrecy), was\r\nupon the eve of completion, when a straggling cow blundered upon the\r\nfrail covering of turf, and became so securely imbedded in the falling\r\nearth that she could not extricate herself. Her bellowing attracted the\r\nattention of the sentinel, the plot was discovered, and, of course,\r\nfrustrated.\r\n\r\nDespite such disappointments, however, when the time came, as it soon\r\ndid, for the prisoners to leave Savannah, they did so with sentiments of\r\ngratitude for the comparatively humane treatment they had received at\r\nthe hands of the Georgians, not unmingled, however, with apprehensions\r\nconcerning their future, for it was openly rumored that they were\r\ndestined to join their former fellow-prisoners now under fire of\r\nGilmore's siege guns at Charleston.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNDER FIRE AT CHARLESTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Under siege.--Charleston Jail.--The Stars and Stripes.--Federal\r\n    compliments.--Under the guns.--Roper Hospital.--Yellow\r\n    Jack.--Sisters of Charity.--Rebel Christianity.--A Byronic\r\n    stanza.--Charleston to Columbia.--\"Camp\r\n    Sorghum.\"--Nemesis.--Another dash for liberty.--Murder of\r\n    Lieutenants Young and Parker.--Studying topography.--A\r\n    vaticination.--Back to reality.\r\n\r\nThe next we see of Lieutenant Glazier is in the city of Charleston,\r\nSouth Carolina, on the twelfth of September, 1864. Coming Street on the\r\nmorning of that day was crowded with people of every variety of calling,\r\nfrom the priest and sister of charity, out on their merciful errands, to\r\nthe riff-raff and _sans-culottes_ out on no errand at all but to help\r\nthe excitement. The city was under siege.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the street a body of six hundred emaciated,\r\nbroken-spirited, ragged men, escorted by a strong guard, marched along,\r\nand the busiest of the pedestrians paused to gaze upon them as they\r\npassed. Coarse and scurrilous was the greeting the captives received\r\nfrom the motley and shameless groups. A few of the more respectable\r\ncitizens, however, spoke words of grace to them, and some added hopeful\r\npredictions of the final triumph of the Union cause. The prisoners were\r\nhurried forward to the yard of Charleston Jail, where for the first time\r\nin many weary months they beheld the glorious flag of their country\r\nfloating in the breeze over Morris Island. Weak as they were the\r\npatriotic sentiment was still strong within and they gave one rousing\r\ncheer! Some, despite the curses of their guard, dancing like children,\r\nwhile others wept tears of joy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Charleston Jail--charleston, South Carolina.]\r\n\r\nThe jail, as Captain Glazier describes it, was a large octagonal\r\nbuilding of four stories, surmounted by a tower. In the rear was a large\r\nworkshop, in appearance like a bastile, where some of the prisoners were\r\nconfined. As a lugubrious accessory to his own quarters, he had a\r\nremarkably clear view of a gallows, erected directly in front of his\r\nfragment of a tent. \"The ground floor of the jail was occupied by\r\nordinary criminal convicts; the second story by Confederate officers and\r\nsoldiers, under punishment for military offences; the third by negro\r\nprisoners, and the fourth by Federal and Confederate deserters, and it\r\nis complimentary to the good sense of the rebels that deserters from\r\n_either_ side were treated by them with equal severity.\" He gives a sad\r\naccount of the terrible condition of the negro soldiers and their\r\nofficers who were captured at Fort Wagner, and says the hospital at this\r\nplace was \"a lazar-house of indescribable misery.\"\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-second of September, Glazier makes the following note on\r\nthe progress of the siege:\r\n\r\n\"Shelling is kept up vigorously. From sixty to a hundred huge, smoking\r\ntwo-hundred-pounders convey Federal compliments daily to the doomed\r\ncity.\"\r\n\r\nIt appears, however, that, for the most part, the destructive effects of\r\nthis bombardment were confined to what was known as the \"burnt\r\ndistrict,\" and caused little damage to the inhabited portion of the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nSeven days after the above entry in his journal his heart was gladdened\r\nby an order for removal, with his fellow-prisoner and messmate,\r\nLieutenant Richardson, to Roper Hospital; a place much more tolerable as\r\nto its situation and appointments, though still within shell-range of\r\nthe bombarding force. Prior to the transfer, a parole was obtained from\r\neach, by which they pledged themselves, while in their new quarters, to\r\nmake no attempt to escape.\r\n\r\nHere our prisoner found opportunity under the usual restrictions for\r\nwriting the following letter home:\r\n\r\n      [Only one page allowed.]\r\n                                               C. S. Military Prison,\r\n                                        Charleston, South Carolina,\r\n                            Roper Hospital, _October 4th, 1864_.\r\n\r\n     My Dear Mother:\r\n\r\n     For a long time you have doubtless waited with anxiety some\r\n     intelligence of your absent son, which would tell you of his\r\n     health, and his prospects of release from the disagreeable\r\n     restraints of prison life; and I am now delighted to find this\r\n     opportunity of writing to you. Since my last letter, which was\r\n     dated at Libby Prison, I have been confined at Danville, Virginia;\r\n     Macon and Savannah, Georgia; and at this point. My health for the\r\n     most part has been very poor, which I attribute to the inactivity\r\n     of prison life. I have also suffered much for want of clothing. I\r\n     have a pair of shoes on to-day that I bought more than a year ago;\r\n     have run about barefoot for days and weeks during the past summer;\r\n     many of my comrades have been compelled to do the same. I do not\r\n     look for a _general exchange_ before winter, though I hope and pray\r\n     that it may take place to-morrow. There is now an opportunity for\r\n     sending boxes to prisoners. I should be glad to receive one from\r\n     home if convenient. Please give my love to all the family circle.\r\n     Remember me to my friends, and believe me ever\r\n\r\n                                           Your affectionate son,\r\n                                                            Willard.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe days passed anxiously with Glazier, when the yellow fever began its\r\ninroads upon the prisoners. He had now, at the same moment, to face\r\ndeath at the hands of man, and by the pestilence--a condition of things\r\nto which the bravest spirit might succumb. One great source of\r\nconsolation was derived from the visits of the Sisters of Charity, who\r\nwere always found where suffering and peril prevailed. Writing of these\r\nangelic women, Captain Glazier says:--\"Confined as we are, so far away\r\nfrom every home comfort and influence, and from all that makes life\r\nworth living, how quickly do we notice the first kind word, the passing\r\nfriendly glance! Can any prisoner confined here ever forget the 'Sisters\r\nof Charity?' Ask the poor private now suffering in the loathsome\r\nhospital so near us, while burning with fever, or racked with pain, if\r\nhe can forget the kind look, the gracious word given him by that sister.\r\nMany are the bunches of grapes--many the sip of their pure juice, that\r\nthe sufferer gets from her hands. They seem, they _are_ 'ministering\r\nangels;' and while all around us are our avowed enemies, they remain\r\ntrue to every instinct of womanhood. They dare lift the finger to help,\r\nthey do relieve many a sufferer. All through the South our sick and\r\nwounded soldiers have had reason to bless the 'Sisters of Charity.' They\r\nhave ministered to their wants and performed those kind womanly offices\r\nwhich are better to the sick than medicine, and are so peculiarly\r\nsoothing to the dying. These noble women have attended their sick-beds\r\nwhen other _Christian_ ladies of the South looked on unpityingly, and\r\nturned away without even tendering the cheap charity of a kind word.\r\n_They_ have done what others were too scornful and cruel to do--they\r\nhave done what others did not dare do. They were, for some inscrutable\r\nreason, permitted to bestow their charities wherever charities were\r\nneeded. Their bounties were bestowed indiscriminately on Federal and\r\nConfederate sufferers, and evidenced a broad philanthropy untainted by\r\nparty-feeling or religious bigotry. Many a poor soldier has followed\r\nthem from ward to ward with tearful eyes.... Were other Christian\r\ndenominations in the South as active in aiding us as the Catholics have\r\nbeen, I might have some faith in 'Rebel Christianity.'\"\r\n\r\nThis is no mean tribute to the beneficent influences of the Catholic\r\nchurch, albeit the pen of a Protestant records it; but the facts fully\r\njustify him. Protestant England had _one_--the Church of Rome has her\r\n_legions_ of Florence Nightingales. They are found in the camp, and the\r\nhospital, and the prison--wherever human sympathy can palliate human\r\nsuffering; they are to be found where even wives and mothers flee before\r\nthe dreaded pestilence, and these ministers of divine love, like light\r\nand air, and the dews of Heaven, visit alike the rich and poor, the\r\nsinner and the saint; the only claim they recognize being the claim of\r\nsuffering and misfortune.\r\n\r\nWillard Glazier remained _under the guns_ of his friends until the fifth\r\nof October, and during his sojourn here had various opportunities of\r\nforming an acquaintance with vagrant shot and shell that struck or\r\nexploded near the hospital building, but fortunately did no greater\r\ndamage to its inmates than create \"a scare.\"\r\n\r\nWhat was much more serious was the prevalence of the deadly fever, which\r\nwas of a most malignant type, and carried off, among its many victims,\r\nthe Confederate commander and his adjutant. The prisoners therefore\r\nwere removed--the authorities assigning as their reason for the step,\r\nthe \"danger to which they would be exposed on account of the fever;\" and\r\nalthough, at the time, it appeared an anomaly to the prisoners, \"after\r\nbringing them there to be murdered by their own guns, to remove them for\r\nthe purpose of saving them from death in another shape,\"--yet it is\r\npossible such was the case. At all events they were removed, and their\r\n\"Poet Laureate\"--Lieutenant Ogden, of Wisconsin--wrote a farewell poem,\r\ncontaining among others, the following \"Byronic\" stanza:\r\n\r\n    \"Thy Sanctuaries are forsaken now;\r\n      Dark mould and moss cling to thy fretted towers;\r\n    Deep rents and seams, where struggling lichens grow,\r\n      And no sweet voice of prayer at vestal hours;\r\n    But voice of screaming shot and bursting shell,\r\n    Thy deep damnation and thy doom foretell.\r\n    The 'fire' has left a pile of broken walls,\r\n    And Night-hags revel in thy ruined halls!\"\r\n\r\nWho will say that a dread Nemesis has not overtaken the metropolis of\r\nthe Palmetto State? Streets, once the busy scene of commerce and\r\nindustry, now covered with grass, in this city of secession--formerly\r\nthe head and front of treason and rebellion and the defiant advocate of\r\nhuman slavery!\r\n\r\nEscorted by the Thirty-second Georgia Volunteers, Glazier and his\r\nfifteen hundred companions were marched through the principal streets of\r\nthe city to the depot, where they took the cars for Columbia, the State\r\ncapital. None will ever forget the parade of ragged and bearded men\r\nthrough King Street. But the Georgian guards, while strictly attentive\r\nto duty, showed the politeness and demeanor of gentlemen. He says of\r\nthem, at this point in the history of his imprisonment, \"the Georgia\r\ntroops seem to be by far the most civil and gentlemanly of all the\r\nSouthern army. They were the most respectable in appearance, most\r\nintelligent and liberal in conversation, and to a greater extent than\r\nothers, recognized the principle that a man is a man under whatever\r\ncircumstances he may be placed, and is entitled to humane treatment.\r\nThey very generally addressed the prisoners as 'gentlemen.'\"\r\n\r\nThe same kind of unventilated and filthy cattle-cars were employed in\r\ntheir transportation as had been used in their various previous\r\nremovals. All suffered from want of water, air and space. The arrival of\r\nthe captives at Columbia took place in the midst of a drenching\r\nrain-storm, and during the entire night, with scarcely any clothing, no\r\nrations, and no shelter, they were exposed to the merciless elements,\r\nwhile not twenty yards off, in front of their camping ground, glared the\r\nmuzzles of a park of loaded artillery. The prisoners, being in a\r\nstarving condition, looked the picture of despair. A discovery however\r\nwas made of some bacon suspended to the rafters of the building that\r\nenclosed them, in one corner separated by a partition. As the famished\r\nmen looked through the bars of a window and saw this tempting food,\r\ntheir eyes watered, and their inventive faculties were aroused. Hooks,\r\nstrings and poles were brought into requisition, and in a short time\r\nmost of the meat, by Yankee talent, was transferred from the rafters of\r\nthe building to the stomachs of the prisoners!\r\n\r\nThe day following, they were moved to a spot about two miles from the\r\ntown, and bivouacked in an open field, without any shelter whatever.\r\nSurrounded by the usual cordon of sentries, and menaced with the\r\ncustomary \"dead-line,\" they were turned loose to provide for themselves,\r\nneither axe, spade, nor cooking utensils being supplied them. Two days\r\nafter their arrival some corn-meal and _sorghum_ were issued, the latter\r\na substitute for molasses. A great many suffered from diarrhoea and\r\ndysentery in consequence, and the place from this circumstance acquired\r\nthe sobriquet of \"Camp Sorghum.\"\r\n\r\nThey had no quarters to protect them from the cold November storms, only\r\nhuts constructed by themselves of brush and pine boughs. The treatment\r\nat \"Camp Sorghum\" was so exceptionally brutal, that almost every dark\r\nnight starving men would run the guard and risk their lives to escape\r\ndying by inches. Sometimes as many as thirty or forty would run in one\r\nnight. Generally some daring fellow would act as _forlorn hope_ and rush\r\npast the sentries, drawing their fire, at the imminent risk of\r\nforfeiting his own life, his comrades joining him before the guards\r\ncould reload their rifles. The latter would then fire a volley into the\r\ncamp, killing or wounding some of the prisoners. Lieutenant Young, of\r\nthe Fourth Pennsylvania Cavalry, was thus shot dead whilst sitting at\r\nhis hut, and according to Captain Glazier, \"no reason for this atrocity\r\nwas apparent, and none was assigned by the guards.\" The poor young\r\nfellow had been a prisoner twenty-two months. About this time the guards\r\naccidentally killed two of their own men, in their reckless and savage\r\nshooting, and afterwards observed more care in firing at the prisoners.\r\n\r\nHounds were kept near the prison to track escaped fugitives. Lieutenant\r\nParker, while attempting to escape, was so much torn and bitten by these\r\ndogs that he died the day after his recapture.\r\n\r\nMingled with thoughts of home, and the friends gathered around loved\r\nfiresides, there had by this time arisen in young Glazier's mind a stern\r\ndetermination to win his freedom, or, in the effort, forfeit his life.\r\n\r\nAs the weather grew colder, the possession of wood became a matter of\r\nnecessity, and some of the prisoners were paroled to pass beyond the\r\nlines, and gather such broken branches and pieces of bark in the\r\nneighboring woods as they could carry back into camp. Glazier availed\r\nhimself of this privilege, and stored up an abundance of fuel. But a\r\nmore important acquisition than fuel to him was the knowledge he\r\nobtained of the topography of the surrounding country. One great\r\ndifficulty he foresaw in getting away arose from the sorry condition of\r\nhis shoes, which were nearly soleless. He succeeded, however, in\r\nobtaining the rim of an old regulation-hat, and out of this fashioned a\r\nserviceable pair of soles for his worn-out brogans, and thus removed one\r\nobstacle from his path.\r\n\r\nWe need feel no surprise that he and many of his companions thought no\r\nrisk too great to run for the chance of effecting their escape. Their\r\ntreatment by this time had become so bad as to be almost unendurable.\r\nFor example, to avoid being frozen to death, they were compelled to run\r\naround all night, and only when the sun arose in the morning dare they\r\nventure to recline themselves on the ground to sleep. The truth is, that\r\nour friend, in common with many of his comrades, had arrived at the\r\ndesperate conclusion that no fate, even death by shooting, or by\r\nhounds, could be worse than the misery and suffering he was now\r\nenduring. It was not alone that they were starved and shelterless, sick\r\nand unattended, nearly naked, with no hope of being clad; it was not\r\nalone that they were immersed, day and night, in filth and squalor like\r\nhogs, with no prospect of relief to cheer them; but, in addition to all\r\nthis suffering of their own, they were compelled to witness the\r\nsufferings of others--to hear their sighs and groans, and look upon\r\nfaces that hard usage and despair had made ghastly and terrible. They\r\nwould greet in the morning a man sick and emaciated perhaps, but still a\r\nhuman being, erect and in God's image, who, in the evening of the same\r\nday, would disappear from among them, making a desperate dash for\r\nfreedom. The following day a broken, nerveless, shivering wretch would\r\nbe dragged into their midst, blood-stained, faint, and with the gashes\r\nof a blood-hound's teeth covering his face and throat.\r\n\r\nThus it was that existence became unbearable. Their own sufferings were\r\nhard, but to continue for many long months looking upon the sufferings\r\nof others added to their misery beyond endurance. Accordingly, when\r\nThanksgiving-day arrived, and the excitement created by Sherman's \"march\r\nto the sea\" had reached its highest point, Glazier and a\r\nfellow-prisoner, named Lieutenant Lemon, determined that _they_ would\r\nwait no longer the slow process of tunneling, but make a bold effort for\r\nliberty--or die in the attempt.\r\n\r\n\"It was customary,\" says the former, \"to extend the guard-line in the\r\nmorning for the purpose of allowing prisoners (as previously stated) to\r\ncollect fuel on a piece of timbered land just opposite the camp, and it\r\nwas our intention this morning to take a shovel, when permitted to pass\r\nto the woods, and make a hole in the ground large enough to receive our\r\ntwo 'skeletons,' and then enlist the services of some friend, who would\r\ncover us up with brush and leaves, so that, when the guard was\r\nwithdrawn, we would be left without the camp.\" The plan looked feasible,\r\nand, if successful, it would not be a difficult matter to reach Augusta,\r\nGeorgia, at which point they hoped to find themselves within Sherman's\r\nlines. The fates, however, decreed otherwise. Their scheme was rendered\r\nabortive by the simple fact, that upon that particular morning, the line\r\nwas not extended at all. Why it was not, is purely a matter of\r\nconjecture. Possibly, \"the morning being unusually cold and raw,\" the\r\nguard did not care to leave their own snug tents along the line of the\r\nencampment, with no greater inducement than that of increasing the\r\ncomfort of their Yankee prisoners, who, for that day, were left without\r\nany fires at all; but, be this as it may, the guard-line was not\r\nextended as was usual, and thus the plot of our young friends was\r\nfrustrated for the time being. They agreed to \"watch, pray _and act_\" at\r\nthe very first opportunity that presented. It was not long before that\r\nopportunity came.\r\n\r\nEarly upon the day following that of their disappointment, the\r\nconspirators arranged that each should make a reconnaissance of the\r\nlines, discover the weak points of the enemy, and, that being\r\naccomplished, rendezvous at a given spot, ready to act upon any likely\r\nplan that might suggest itself to them. Glazier had become a tolerably\r\nexpert physiognomist, and singled out an unsophisticated-looking\r\ngiant, who was patrolling a certain beat, as the best man among the line\r\nof sentries on whom to practise an imposition. This individual was\r\nevidently a good-natured lout, not long in the service, and very much\r\nresembling our conception of \"Jonas Chuzzlewit,\" in respect to his\r\nhaving been \"put away and forgotten for half a century.\" It is only\r\nnecessary to add that his owners \"had stuck a musket in his hand, and\r\nplaced him on guard.\" Yet there was some pluck in him. He was just the\r\nsort of man who, led by a good officer, would fight like a lion, but\r\nwhose animal instincts had so befogged his intellect that, if left to\r\nhis own resources, he would be as likely to ruin friend as foe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Escape From Columbia--crossing The Dead Line.]\r\n\r\nWhen Glazier rejoined his comrade, he described this man, and the\r\nfriends agreed that they would boldly cross the \"dead-line\" immediately\r\nin front of him, be ready to answer promptly his challenge, and, by the\r\naudacity of their movement, attempt to deceive him in regard to their\r\nreal character and purpose. With such a man as they had to deal with,\r\nthis scheme was certain to result in one of two things: he would let\r\nthem pass, or he would kill them both; therefore, courage and\r\n_sang-froid_ were matters of first necessity.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, with the utmost coolness, and laughing and chatting\r\ntogether, they sauntered up to and upon the fatal line. The sentinel\r\nlooked at them in amazement. He then brought his piece to bear upon\r\nGlazier completely covering his person, and, with the usual order to\r\n\"Halt!\" added: \"Whar in hell are you going, Yanks?\" As if his dignity\r\nwas seriously offended by this demand, our hero answered this question\r\nby asking another: \"Do you halt paroled prisoners here?\" \"His meek 'No,\r\nsir!'\" Glazier relates, \"was not yet lost in the distance when I boldly\r\ncrossed the dreaded line, adding: 'Then let my friend in the rear follow\r\nme;' and so we passed, while the sentinel murmured 'All right!' And\r\nright it was, for now we were free, breathing the fresh air, untainted\r\nby the breath of hundreds of famishing, diseased and dying men.\"\r\n\r\nThey could not proceed very far without falling in with numbers of the\r\nparoled prisoners. This they did, but their presence excited no\r\nsuspicion or comment, as they assumed to belong to the party. They\r\napplied themselves to gathering wood and piling it apparently for\r\ntransportation, and gradually crept on and on until they reached a point\r\nbeyond the vision of the gray-jackets, when off they started at the top\r\nof their speed; and although before long they were compelled to reduce\r\ntheir pace, they put several miles behind them in a space of time that\r\nat any other period of their lives, or under any other circumstances,\r\nwould have seemed impossible. Pausing to regain breath, they turned, and\r\n_Columbia_ was no longer within sight. This, in itself, was a relief,\r\nfor the place was associated in their minds with the intense misery they\r\nhad suffered within its boundaries.\r\n\r\nCould these men have _foreseen_ the not very distant future, they would\r\nhave known that every sigh and groan that cruelty had wrung from them in\r\nthat place of torture would be avenged; they would have seen loyal\r\nsoldiers swarming in its streets, their old comrades in misery torn from\r\nthe grasp of their merciless jailers, and the soulless \"Southern\r\nChivalry\" thrust into their place; they would have seen red-handed\r\nvengeance doom that city of blood to destruction, and the glaring\r\ntongues of fire lap up the costly goods and edifices of its vile and\r\nrelentless citizens; and those who had no mercy for them in their\r\nwretchedness and famine, now awe-struck on finding that the men they had\r\nso barbarously trampled upon had now the power and the will to retort\r\nupon them with interest; they would have seen brothers in arms, who\r\nuntil now had been merciful to their enemies when in their power,\r\nsuddenly transformed into ravenous wolves, fierce and terrible in their\r\nrighteous wrath at the treatment their less fortunate brothers had met\r\nwith in this city of blood. The Avenger had come! and not one house but\r\nwould fall a smouldering heap of ruins. They would have foreseen this\r\ncity ablaze with burning homes for its sins against humanity; its men,\r\nso lately drunk with pride and satiated with cruelty to their\r\ncountrymen; its women divested of all womanly attributes, and invested\r\nwith those of demons, _now_ all cowed and humbled in the dust! They\r\nwould have seen one noted instance of the interference of a just\r\nProvidence that occurred amid all this dreadful saturnalia--a woman,\r\npale, but beautiful of feature, delicate of form, madly rushing to and\r\nfro in front of her blazing house, crying for her child that lay within\r\nit. They would have seen a poor, emaciated prisoner, roused to exhibit\r\nstrength and courage by the hope of saving life, rush in and drag the\r\ncradle and its innocent living freight from the very jaws of death,\r\nwhile burning rafters crashed and fell upon him; they would have seen\r\nhim place the babe in its mother's arms, and they would have seen that\r\nmother turn with streaming eyes to thank the saviour of her child, _and\r\nthen start back conscience-smitten, and scream and fall, seeing in her\r\nchild's preserver a man who in the prison had once implored her for a\r\npiece of bread because he was starving, and she spat upon him because he\r\nwas of Northern race_!! Could they have seen the future of the coming\r\nmonths, they would have seen all this and more. But no such prevision\r\nwas vouchsafed them. Their thoughts were now of themselves. They felt\r\nthat the shade of a deadly peril encompassed them. Columbia and its\r\nprison were hidden from their sight, but still they were so near that at\r\nany moment the hounds might scent them, and if recaptured, all the\r\nhorrors they had undergone would be light compared with the fate they\r\nmust submit to in the future.\r\n\r\nFortunately for the purpose of our fugitives, the settlements, whether\r\ntowns or villages, in that part of the country, were \"few and far\r\nbetween.\" The residences of the planters were also distant from each\r\nother and few in number, and the ravines and swamps which abound there,\r\nwhile in many respects disagreeable and dangerous lurking spots, were\r\nstill the safest refuges for hunted men. The wilder the country, the\r\nbetter it promised to Glazier and his comrade fleeing for their lives.\r\nTheir greatest fear was the dreaded blood-hound. Our friends knew they\r\ncould defeat most of the devices of human ingenuity in tracking them,\r\nbut they were apprehensive that the instinct of the brutes, which a\r\ndepraved humanity had enlisted in its service, might render abortive all\r\ntheir plans and precautions. They did their best, however, to baffle\r\ntheir canine foes, and nightfall found them hurrying forward on the\r\nLexington Court-house Road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ESCAPE FROM COLUMBIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Mysterious voices.--\"I reckon deys Yankees.\"--\"Who comes\r\n    there?\"--The Lady of the Manor.--A weird spectacle.--The struggle\r\n    through the swamp.--A reflection on Southern swamps in\r\n    general.-\"Tired nature's sweet restorer.\"\r\n\r\nThe attention of the fugitives was suddenly arrested by the sound of\r\nhuman voices in their immediate rear. It occurred to both at once to\r\ndiscover as quickly as possible if the speakers were white or black, and\r\nthey accordingly listened in the hope of learning their color by their\r\ndialect. This was by no means easy, the vernacular of the poorer class\r\nof whites in that section of the country very much resembling the\r\nordinary dialect of the negroes. The comrades, however, concluded to\r\nrisk a halt until the strangers came up. Glazier then saluted them with\r\nthe remark that it was \"a pleasant night,\" with the view of drawing them\r\nout before committing himself. \"Indeed 'tis!\" was the reply. This failed\r\nto convey the desired information as to the color of the strangers, and\r\nthey thought it wiser to hurry forward than prolong the conversation at\r\nsome risk to their safety. Before they had advanced many steps, however,\r\nthey were agreeably surprised by hearing one of the same party remark to\r\nanother, \"I reckon deys Yankees,\" followed by the response, \"Golly, I\r\nhope to God dey is!\" Glazier immediately turned and inquired, \"Do you\r\nknow who I am?\" \"I reckon I dunno yer, massa,\" was the reply. \"Have you\r\never seen a Yankee?\" asked Glazier. \"Lord bress yer, marser, I've seen a\r\nright smart heap ov um down at Clumby.\" \"Well,\" said Glazier, \"do we\r\nlook like them?\" \"How'n de debbil can I tell dat in de dark, marser?\"\r\nanswered the now unmistakable negro, \"but I spec' yer talk jest like'\r\nem.\" \"We are Yankees,\" responded Glazier, \"and have just escaped from\r\nColumbia. My good fellow, can't you do something for us?\" \"Ob course!\"\r\nsaid our colored friend, promptly. \"I'll do all I can for you, marster.\r\nI no nigga if I didn't 'sist de Yankees.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Escape--fed By Negroes In A Swamp.]\r\n\r\nThe fugitives had heard so much from their fellow-prisoners of the\r\nsympathy exhibited by the colored people of the South for Federal\r\nsoldiers, that they hesitated not for a moment to place the fullest\r\nconfidence in these humble friends. They thereupon explained their\r\nprecise situation, and told them the story of their recent escape. They\r\nalso learned from the negroes that they were returning to their masters,\r\nhaving come from Columbia, where they had been working upon a new prison\r\nstockade, now abandoned on account of the expected approach of General\r\nSherman.\r\n\r\nThe name of their \"Master\" was Steadman, and, slave-fashion, one of the\r\nmen was named \"Ben Steadman.\" They were directing their steps to Mr.\r\nSteadman's plantation on the Augusta Road, and the fugitives therefore\r\ndecided to keep in their company and use them as guides. In the nature\r\nof things, unless guided by some one accustomed to traveling in a\r\ncountry so bare of landmarks, they would lose ground continually, even\r\nif they ever reached their destination.\r\n\r\nOne of the negroes with that shrewdness engendered by slavery, in which\r\ncunning is the only protection against injury; and strength and courage\r\ncount for nothing; suggested that so large a party would attract\r\nattention, and the safety of the two officers might be endangered. It\r\nwas therefore finally determined that Ben should act as guide, and the\r\nother darkies take a different route home. Another advantage to be\r\nderived from dividing the party was that in the event of the fugitives\r\nbeing pursued, the double trail would mystify the hounds. Ere long Ben\r\nreached a bridle-path, which plunged into the wood, and as it offered\r\nsuperior advantages on account of its narrowness and privacy, and from\r\nthe fact of its leading to the plantation of a well-known planter and\r\ntherefore less likely to be suspected of being the road taken by escaped\r\nprisoners, the little party concluded that this was their safest route.\r\nThey therefore hurried forward upon their way, Ben preceding them in the\r\ndouble capacity of guide and scout. A few miles from its commencement\r\nthis path led to a blind road, which Ben informed them was seldom\r\ntraveled by any in the night-time but men of his own race, so they\r\nturned into it, and had become quite joyful and careless, when suddenly\r\nthe challenge, \"Who goes there?\" rang out in the stillness, and the next\r\nmoment Ben was halted by the sentry of a Confederate picket consisting\r\nof eight men, who had bivouacked just off the road. Ben boldly advanced,\r\nand our two friends, it must be admitted, with more discretion than\r\nvalor, started off like lightning, their \"guide\" meanwhile amusing the\r\nguard with a description of how \"Dem two oder dam niggas got skeered,\r\nkase dey thought Mars Sentinel must be a dam Yank!\"\r\n\r\nNo harm could come to Ben, as he was in a condition to prove that two\r\nother negroes had left Columbia with him, and the fugitives therefore\r\nfeeling that _he_ was safe, concealed themselves among the brush and\r\nawaited events. Ben shortly passed their place of hiding, in custody,\r\n_en route_ to the Reserve, and our friends were not a little amused,\r\ndespite their danger, to hear Ben's vigorous denunciation of \"dem two\r\ncowardly niggas,\" who had taken to their heels!\r\n\r\nA few moments only elapsed before they were made aware, by certain\r\nunmistakable tokens, that they were in dangerous proximity to the\r\nConfederate encampment, and although nearly famished, for they had eaten\r\nnothing since morning, it was deemed safest to lie _perdu_; so, thanking\r\nthe good Providence which had sped them thus far on their journey, they\r\nlay down and slept.\r\n\r\nThe enemy's camp, which upon closer inspection, turned out to be simply\r\nthe resting-place of a local patrol, unconnected with any regular\r\ncommand, broke up early in the morning, and Glazier and his companion\r\nonce more had a clear road. Although hungry from long fasting, they ran\r\nswiftly over the swampy ground, and felt so elated to find themselves\r\nagain in a state of freedom, that they laughed and joked like boys\r\nreleased from school, and pushed on until the verge of an extensive\r\nmorass was reached and passed, and they found themselves in a section of\r\ncountry well wooded and watered, the alternate hills and vales\r\npresenting a pleasing variety to the eye.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pursuit Of Knowledge Under Difficulties.]\r\n\r\nThere was here also a public road, but it would have been dangerous to\r\ntravel thereon, and they therefore strode on beneath the trees and\r\numbrageous undergrowth of the wood. Having had no breakfast,\r\n\"blueberries\" were not precisely the diet they would have selected for\r\ndinner, but as _necessitas non habet leges_, they quietly munched their\r\nberries, and we may hope felt grateful that matters were no worse. After\r\na while they made a sudden detour, crossing the high-road, and by so\r\ndoing, again broke the trail. Next they came to a clearing, but the\r\nsight of a planter leaning against a fence, soon sent them back to the\r\nfriendly shelter of the wood. Late in the afternoon they came to a large\r\nplantation on the border of which was a copse, in which they lay down\r\nand watched for the opportunity of communicating with some of the house\r\nslaves. At the expiration of about an hour, a lady, probably the\r\nmistress of the estate, passed within a few yards of them, accompanied\r\nby a troupe of merry children. They however went on their way, utterly\r\nunconscious of the close proximity of two terrible Yankees!\r\n\r\nHere our fugitives remained quietly concealed until night, and then\r\ncautiously crept away. They proceeded onward until they found themselves\r\nnear a junction of cross-roads. Arrived at this junction, matters looked\r\nserious. Unlike mariners, they had no compass; unlike Indians, they were\r\ninexpert at discerning a trail; and what was more appalling, they\r\ndistinctly saw reared up against the moonlit sky--a gallows! Our two\r\nfriends approached this object very cautiously. It was not an unusual\r\nthing to hang spies, and not unfrequently those _mistaken_ for spies,\r\nbut to hang them on a regularly constructed gibbet was not usual; and\r\ntherefore while Lemon insisted that the black and skeleton-like object\r\nthat loomed against the horizon was a gallows, he still entertained some\r\ndoubt upon the subject, and determined to satisfy himself by a closer\r\ninspection.\r\n\r\nThe weird object before them proved to be an innocent guide-board--the\r\narticle of all others they most needed at that moment. Like the\r\ncelebrated laws of Nero, however, the _directions_ were posted very\r\nhigh, but Lemon being tall, our hero mounted on his shoulders and by the\r\nlight of the moon deciphered the inscription. They had now no difficulty\r\nin choosing their way. On they pushed therefore; and during the black\r\ndarkness of the night, crept through the tangled underwood, and over\r\nswamps where loathsome, crawling things that shun by day the presence of\r\nman, now seemed to seek his acquaintance. How mysterious are these dense\r\nuntrodden forests of the South! The very air one breathes is living.\r\nThroughout the day a million chirping, whirring, twittering sounds,\r\nsalute the ear. The short grass beneath the forest trees moves, writhes,\r\nand creeps with microscopic life, until the brain grows dizzy at the\r\nsight. At night it is no less marvellous to hear the myriad denizens of\r\nthe swamps and woods; and terrible when your tread on some soft, velvety\r\nsubstance reveals a sleeping snake, who, at the same moment, attacks you\r\nwith his poisonous fang, mayhap, fatally.\r\n\r\nIt is a singular, but well-accredited fact, that these great Southern\r\nswamps have been yearly deteriorating, while the surrounding country has\r\nbeen growing in civilization. Old writers tell us that the reptile life\r\nnow infesting them in such rank luxuriance had scarcely any existence\r\none hundred years ago. Colonel Byrd writes of the \"Dismal Swamp:\" \"Since\r\nthe surveyors have entered the Dismal Swamp they have seen no living\r\ncreature; neither bird, beast, insect nor reptile, came to view. Not\r\neven a turkey-buzzard will venture to fly over it, no more than the\r\nItalian vulture will venture to fly over the filthy lake of Avernus; or\r\nthe birds of the Holy Land over the Salt Sea where Sodom and Gomorrah\r\nonce stood.\" And yet, in the present day, insect and reptile life swarms\r\nthere in every form through all the hours of the day and night!\r\n\r\nOur fugitive friends, however, felt little inclination to philosophize\r\nupon this subject. The hope of coming liberty strengthened their limbs,\r\nand they bent all their energy to the task of moving forward; walking,\r\nrunning, creeping, until the dawn of day approached, when weary and\r\nfootsore they sought some secure spot and lay down and slept--perchance\r\nto dream of \"Home, sweet Home\"--perchance of \"Camp Sorghum,\" and its\r\n\"chivalric\" guards--perchance of the dreadful blood-hounds whose fatal\r\nscent might even then be on their trail!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOYALTY OF THE NEGROES.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Startled by hounds.--An unpleasant predicament.--A Christian\r\n    gentlewoman.--Appeal to Mrs. Colonel Taylor.--\"She did all she\r\n    could.\"--A meal fit for the gods.--Aunt Katy.--\"Lor' bress ye,\r\n    marsters!\"--Uncle Zeb's prayer.--Hoe-cake and pinders.--Woodcraft\r\n    _versus_ astronomy.--Canine foes.--Characteristics of the\r\n    slave.--Meeting escaped prisoners.--Danger.--Retreat and\r\n    concealment.\r\n\r\nIt is the morning of November twenty-eighth, 1864. The sun has just\r\nrisen above the eastern hills, and his slanting beams fall upon the\r\ngoodly heritage of Colonel Alexander Taylor, \"C. S. A.\" There are, as\r\nyet, none of the usual features here of a war-stricken country;\r\neverything around is rich and substantial. The residence is a stately\r\nmansion in the Elizabethan style, and the lady who, accompanied by two\r\nsweet children, walks the broad piazza, is evidently a refined\r\ngentlewoman. The colonel himself, like a gallant (but mistaken) knight,\r\nhas \"gone to the wars.\"\r\n\r\nShe marvels what makes \"Rupert,\" a noble hound, that but a moment ago\r\nstretched himself at full length across the hallway, rise and bound over\r\nthe lawn, barking loudly and fiercely as he runs. She calls him--at\r\nfirst gently, and then peremptorily, until the old hound with evident\r\nreluctance obeys the summons, and crouches at her feet. She then directs\r\na negro, whose tokens of age and long service are as pronounced as those\r\nof his canine rival, to find out what there is in the clump of trees\r\nbeyond the north hedge, to excite \"Rupert's\" anger. The venerable negro,\r\nwith the deliberateness of his race, proceeds in the direction\r\nindicated, but is saved the necessity of much exertion, by the startling\r\nappearance of a young soldier in a motley uniform of gray and blue--his\r\ncoat of one color--his nether garments of another! He advances boldly\r\ntoward the house, and the lady scrutinizes the intruder. The result of\r\nher examination shows her visitor to be a slight, but sinewy young man,\r\nwith a frank and honest expression, and seemingly not more than eighteen\r\nyears of age. The motley stranger drew near, and bowing gracefully\r\nsaluted her with, \"Good-morning, madam.\"\r\n\r\nThe lady at once returned the salutation with a genial smile, that sent\r\na thrill of pleasure and confidence to his heart. Without further\r\nceremony he thereupon frankly and fearlessly informed Mrs. Taylor that\r\nhe and his companion were escaped Union prisoners; that they were in a\r\ncondition of starvation; and appealed respectfully but most urgently to\r\nher as a woman, for humanity's sake, to assist them in their sore need\r\nby giving them food. She at first hesitated, startled by such a request\r\nfrom such a source. Her husband, she said, was an officer in the\r\nConfederate service, and if it became known that she had assisted those\r\nwhom his government counted enemies, it would possibly bring reproach\r\nupon him. Our young hero (for he it was) then addressed her somewhat\r\nafter the fashion of the unfortunate Ulysses in his appeal to the\r\ngoddess Calypso; recounted his misfortunes briefly, touched on the\r\nterrible fate that awaited him and his companion, should they be\r\nrecaptured, and all doubtless in such moving terms that, like\r\nDesdemona, the lady must have thought, if she did not exclaim:\r\n\r\n    \"'Twas pitiful--'twas wondrous pitiful!\"\r\n\r\nThis is evident from the fact that she scarcely awaited the end of his\r\nstory, before assuring him that \"she would do all she could,\" following\r\nup that assurance in a few moments by offering the manly and polite\r\nyouth before her an abundant supply of fresh and excellent food; which,\r\nshe took the precaution of adding, was for himself and his comrade,\r\nfearing possibly, from Glazier's famished look, he might consume it all\r\nhimself! She further assured her visitor that she would keep the secret\r\nof his having been there; while he, in return, protested that should the\r\nvarying fortunes of war give him the opportunity of serving her husband,\r\nhe would do so at the risk of his life. With his haversack amply\r\nreplenished, an appetite like a wolf, faith in the goodness of God\r\nstrengthened, and belief in the perfection of some, at least, of the\r\nfairest portion of creation greatly confirmed by this interview, he\r\nrejoined Lieutenant Lemon, and the comrades proceeded forthwith to their\r\nmeal which was enjoyed with a zest known only to the starving. Before\r\nreclining himself under the glittering stars, Glazier made this entry in\r\nhis diary: \"Oh! ye who sleep on beds of down, in your curtained\r\nchambers, and rise at your leisure to feast upon the good things\r\nprovided ... you never knew the luxury of a night of _rest_, nor the\r\nsweets of a meal seasoned by hunger, and the grateful remembrance that\r\nit was provided by woman's kindly heart, which, wherever it may beat,\r\nsooner or later responds to the tale of misfortune.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a sleep so profound as to extend several hours beyond the time\r\nthey had agreed upon as best adapted for the resumption of their\r\njourney, they found themselves much refreshed and strengthened, so much\r\nso that by sunrise they had reached a small stream known as Black Creek,\r\none of the tributaries of the North Edisto River. Here, in crossing a\r\nbridge, they very opportunely encountered a colored laborer, who was on\r\nhis way to work, and who cheerfully turned aside to guide them to a hut,\r\nwhere he assured them they could remain in safety throughout the day.\r\nThe proprietor of this refuge for hunted wayfarers was a certain \"Aunt\r\nKaty\"--an aged negress, whose heart and hut, and such fare as her scanty\r\nlarder contained, were always at the disposal of the distressed. Hearing\r\nthat the strangers were Union soldiers who had escaped from Columbia,\r\nshe approached them with the following salutation: \"Gor A'mighty bress\r\nyer, marsters; dis is de yeah ob jubilee, shua, when de Yankees come to\r\nAunt Katy's. Come in, marsters, come in!\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly they entered, and, by some occult process, the fact of their\r\npresence soon became known to the entire slave population of the\r\nneighborhood, who came flocking in throughout the day. Such an important\r\noccasion would have been incomplete without a prayer-meeting, Aunt Katy\r\nherself being a pillar of the Colored Methodist Church, and it was not\r\nlong before the whole assemblage were on their knees, invoking every\r\nimaginable blessing upon the cause of the Union and its defenders, and\r\nevery evil upon its opponents. Among other things Captain Glazier\r\nrecords, as a feature of this impromptu prayer-meeting, is the petition\r\nof a venerable prototype of \"Uncle Tom,\" named Zebulon, \"who appeared\r\nto be a ruling spirit in the party.\" This good man's enthusiasm burst\r\nforth as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Oh Lor' Gor A'mighty! We'se you-ah chillen as much as de white folks\r\nam, and we spec yo to heah us widout delay, Lor'; cause we all is in\r\nright smart ob a hurry. Dese yere gemmen has runned away from de\r\nSeceshers, and wants ter git back to de Norf!

Dey has long 'pressed de black man, and groun' him in de dust,\r\nand now I reck'n dey 'spects dat dey am agwine to serve de Yankees in de\r\nsame way.\r\n\r\n\"'Sist dese gemmen in time ob trouble, and lift 'em fru all danger on to\r\nde udder side ob Jordan dry-shod.\r\n\r\n\"And raise de radiance ob your face on all de Yankees what's shut up in\r\nde Souf.

O Lor'! eberlastin'. Amen.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Uncle Zeb's Prayer.]\r\n\r\nThis very pertinent supplication and much more in the same vein, was\r\nlistened to with marked approval by the audience--a sonorous and\r\nprolonged \"Amen!\" in which our friends heartily participated, greeting\r\nthe conclusion of Uncle Zeb's prayer. Our subject, in describing the\r\nparticulars of his escape, remarks that, notwithstanding the fact that\r\nthe secret of their retreat was known to some thirty or forty of these\r\npoor slaves, neither he nor his companion entertained the shadow of a\r\ndoubt that the secret would be safe with them; and adds that, in\r\naddition to their good faith, they possessed a remarkable talent for\r\nconcealment.\r\n\r\nThe Steadman plantation was only three miles from Aunt Katy's hut, and\r\naccordingly, Ben being sent for, soon made his appearance, and proffered\r\nhis valuable services as guide. The offer was thankfully accepted; but,\r\ndespite the preference of Glazier and his companion for the swamp as the\r\nsafest place of concealment, Ben prevailed upon them to visit his cabin,\r\nwhere they were hospitably entertained by his wife and children. Having\r\nbeen duly inspected as curiosities \"from de Norf,\" our friends were\r\npleased to hear Ben instruct his little daughter to run up to the house\r\nof his mistress and \"snatch a paper.\" She soon afterward came running\r\nback with the Augusta _Constitutionalist_, published that morning.\r\n\r\nHaving gathered from the newspaper a sufficiently intelligible idea of\r\nthe relative position of Sherman and his opponents, the fugitives bade\r\nfarewell to the family, and proceeded upon their way, crossing the river\r\nby ten o'clock; and shortly after--Ben having parted from them--in\r\nconsequence of the complicated directions of numerous _blind-roads_,\r\nthey became confused, and, instead of pushing forward beyond the South\r\nEdisto, as they had planned to do, halted early in the afternoon and\r\n\"pitched their tent\" for the remainder of the day and night--said _tent_\r\nhaving the sky for its roof as usual.\r\n\r\nTheir camping-ground upon this occasion was in the heart of a dense pine\r\nwood, where, notwithstanding the grim and spectral surroundings, they\r\nslept soundly until after midnight, and then arose refreshed and ready\r\nfor another day's march on the road to freedom. Hoe-cake and pinders\r\n(_anglice_, peanuts) formed their only repast, which they found\r\nsufficiently luxurious under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nIt now became necessary to find their bearings. There was no star\r\nplainly visible, and they had not yet learned to take the moon as a\r\nguide. Moreover, the heavenly bodies in Southern latitudes have so\r\ndifferent an appearance from those seen at the North, that they were\r\nfrequently in doubt as to the points of the compass. \"I remember,\"\r\nwrites Captain Glazier, \"that it caused me great grief to find that the\r\nNorth Star was much nearer the horizon, and seemed to have lost that\r\nprominence which is given to it in higher latitudes, where it is a\r\nguide, standing far above tree-top and mountain.\"\r\n\r\nWhat the lofty stars failed to teach, however, they learned from humbler\r\nsigns. Glazier, in his youth, acquired the lesson in woodcraft, that\r\nmoss hangs heaviest upon the northern side of tree trunks; and then the\r\nstreams in this part of the continent, for the most part, flow towards\r\nthe southeast, so that our friends were not altogether without\r\nindications of their position with regard to the points of the compass.\r\n\r\nThey were greatly annoyed by a serious obstacle to their safe progress,\r\nwhich presented itself in the shape of a vast multitude of dogs, of all\r\nsizes and every variety of breed. There were dogs of high degree, dogs\r\nof low degree, and mongrel curs of no degree; and all these animals in\r\ncommon were in possession of one ambition, namely, to nose out and hunt\r\na Yankee!\r\n\r\nConsequently, from the deep-mouthed baying of the blood-hound, or the\r\nmastiff, to the sniff and snarl of the rat-terrier, their music was not\r\nagreeable to the fugitives, who had, however, to contend with this\r\ndifficulty, and surmount it.\r\n\r\nConfining themselves to the pathless forest, the roads were now\r\nfrequently lost sight of for miles. Occasionally, in the effort to shun\r\nthe high-road, they would come suddenly upon a dwelling, and the\r\ninevitable lank, yellow dog would pounce out upon them, and add wings to\r\ntheir feet.\r\n\r\nIt was always a pleasant interruption of their lonely tramp to meet any\r\nnegroes. These people, so patient under oppression, so humble under\r\ncorrection, were ever faithful and devoted to those whom they believed\r\nto be the friends of their race. Our hero, of course, had rare\r\nopportunities of observing the characteristics of this people. Simple,\r\nharmless and gentle, crimes of violence among them were very rare, and\r\nthe cruelties practised upon them seem rather to have opened their\r\nhearts to sympathy than to have hardened them into vindictiveness.\r\n\r\nWith the aid of many of these devoted people, Glazier and his friend\r\nreached and crossed the North Edisto, the latter a task of some\r\nmagnitude. The river, at the point where they reached it, is not a\r\nsingle stream, but a maze of creeks and bayous, all of which it was\r\nnecessary to cross in order to attain the opposite bank of what is known\r\nas the South Edisto River.\r\n\r\nWhile passing over a bridge that spanned one of the creeks, Glazier\r\nheard footsteps upon another bridge in their rear; and so trained and\r\nacute does the ear of man become when disciplined in such a school of\r\nperilous experiences, that he knew at once they had nothing to fear from\r\nthose who followed; for, instead of the bold, firm tread of the man who\r\nhunts, it was the uncertain, hesitating, half-halting step of the\r\nhunted.\r\n\r\n\"Escaped prisoners,\" whispered our two friends simultaneously, and\r\nGlazier, stepping boldly forth, gave the challenge, \"Who goes there!\"\r\n\r\n\"With a trembling start,\" says our fugitive hero, \"the foremost man\r\nreplied, 'Friends!'\r\n\r\n\"'Halt, friends! and advance one,'\" commanded Lieutenant Glazier.\r\n\r\nVery cautiously, and with the manner of one ready to turn at any moment\r\nand dash into the recesses of the swamp, one of the strangers came\r\nforward to within a few feet of his interrogator, and craning his body\r\nover, peered nervously into his face. Thereupon a mutual recognition as\r\nFederals was the result, and Lemon discovered that one of the new comers\r\nhad been a fellow-prisoner with himself. This made matters pleasant, and\r\nalthough it was mutually agreed that it would be wise to separate, and\r\ntake different routes, both parties unconsciously protracted the meeting\r\nuntil they were startled into caution by perceiving almost directly in\r\nfront of them, surrounding a large fire, a Confederate encampment. \"It\r\nproved to be a squad of tax-gatherers, going about the country with\r\nquartermasters' wagons, collecting supplies.\"\r\n\r\nFurther progress was now impossible. The enemy occupied the only\r\npracticable road in front, and they were flanked on both sides by large\r\nponds of water. Our party thereupon stealthily retreated into the woods,\r\nwhere they finally concluded to make themselves contented for the\r\nremainder of the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGRESS OF THE FUGITIVES.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Parting company.--Thirst and no water.--Hoping for the end.--The\r\n    boy and the chicken.--Conversation of ladies overheard.--The\r\n    fugitives pursued.--The sleeping village.--Captain Bryant.--The\r\n    _alba sus._--Justifiable murder, and a delicious meal.--Darkies\r\n    and their prayers.--Man proposes; God disposes.--An\r\n    adventure.--_A ruse de guerre._--Across the Savannah.\r\n\r\nOn emerging from their place of concealment, the following morning, the\r\nroad proved to be once more open. The tax-collectors had departed.\r\nWarned by the experience of the previous night the newly found friends\r\nreluctantly parted company, Glazier and Lemon pursuing a separate route\r\nfrom the others.\r\n\r\nOur friends had suffered much in various ways since they shook the dust\r\nof Columbia from their feet, but now a dire misfortune overtook them in\r\nthe total absence of water. The waters of the swamps were poisonous, and\r\ntheir longing desire and hope was that they might soon come upon a\r\nspring or stream to slake their burning thirst, which threatened to\r\nunfit them for the exertion necessary.\r\n\r\nThe land, in the region of country they had now entered, was waste and\r\narid--for the most part sand, a few stunted trees being the sole\r\nvegetation. These trees had nothing pleasant in their appearance, as\r\nforest trees usually have. The branches seemed destitute of sap, as the\r\nleaves were of verdure; they had not reached maturity, and yet\r\npossessed none of the lithe grace of saplings.\r\n\r\nOur fugitives were parched, fevered, and weak before they emerged from\r\nthis inhospitable tract of country, but at length reached a point where\r\nthe vegetation was fresher, and finally, to their great joy, discovered\r\na spring. Here, to use Glazier's own words, they realized \"the value of\r\ncold water to a thirsty soul.\" \"The stream ran through a ravine nearly a\r\nhundred feet in depth, while high up on the banks were groves of pines.\"\r\n\r\nAfter their passage through the \"Desert,\" they were in excellent\r\ncondition to appreciate the wild and solemn grandeur of the spot they\r\nhad now reached, and for a considerable time they could not make up\r\ntheir minds to leave the place. At length, however, they resumed their\r\njourney. December second found the two friends still far from their\r\ndestination, and by no means out of danger. It was one week only since\r\nthey bade adieu to Columbia, and yet many weeks seemed to them to have\r\npassed. Still they were making considerable progress, and had by this\r\ntime reached a swamp near Aiken, South Carolina.\r\n\r\nHaving journeyed all night since quitting the secluded ravine, they were\r\nready once more to cast themselves upon the soft moss under a venerable\r\ntree, near which was a bubbling spring. Here they slept soundly until\r\ndawn, when a colored boy passing down a road which came within their\r\nrange of vision, attracted attention. The boy was carrying a basket, and\r\nthey were suffering very seriously again from hunger. Lemon followed,\r\nand called to him: \"Hold on, my boy; I want to see you!\" The lad\r\nmuttered something, but the only word they could distinguish was\r\n\"chicken!\" He then ran off as fast as his legs would carry him. The\r\nlieutenant, with great emphasis, endeavored to reassure him, but it was\r\nof no use. He ran as if a legion of evil spirits was at his heels, and\r\nLemon returned to his comrade very much disappointed and chagrined. \"Now\r\nthey are sure to overtake us,\" said he, \"we shall be prisoners again\r\nbefore night!\"\r\n\r\n\"Never fear,\" was the reply of his cooler companion; \"as long as there\r\nis a swamp in the neighborhood, we'll lead them a lively dance.\"\r\n\r\nSo the friends gathered up their belongings, and in a few minutes put a\r\nconsiderable distance between themselves and their resting-place of the\r\npreceding night. Finally they concealed themselves in a swamp about a\r\nmile distant. A road bordered the margin of their sanctuary so closely,\r\nthat they distinctly overheard a conversation between three ladies who\r\npassed. The chasing of a negro boy by a Yankee was the topic of their\r\ndiscourse.\r\n\r\nThis information made our friends more cautious, and it is well they\r\nwere so, for, towards evening, several mounted men armed with guns were\r\nseen by them upon the main road leading to Aiken; their evident purpose\r\nbeing to intercept the fugitives, of whose presence in their\r\nneighborhood the boy had made report.\r\n\r\nForewarned was forearmed, and our hero and his companion determined to\r\ngive the enemy a wide berth. Again, therefore, plunging into the\r\nrecesses of a neighboring swamp, they went quietly to sleep, and slept\r\nuntil midnight, when Glazier awoke to see thousands of stars glittering\r\nthrough the spectral branches of the pines, and away off toward the\r\nwestern horizon, a flood of silvery effulgence from the waning moon.\r\n\r\nEntranced by the beauty of the scene, he awoke his comrade, and all\r\naround being buried in profound silence, they proceeded on their way. It\r\nwas not long before they found themselves upon the outskirts of the\r\nvillage of Aiken, and no practicable path upon either side presenting\r\nitself, but one resource remained, namely, to steal cautiously through,\r\nalthough this involved the imminent risk of discovery. On, therefore,\r\nthey walked until they came to the border of the village. They found it\r\ndumb with sleep. Not a sound disturbed the silence. The very dogs, their\r\nusually sleepless foes, appeared for once to have become wearied and\r\ngone to rest.\r\n\r\nThere is something solemn about a sleeping town. The solitude of the\r\nswamp and wood is solemn; but the ghostly stillness of a town, where all\r\nits inhabitants lie buried in sleep, and no sign or sound proclaims the\r\npresence of life in man or beast, is of so weird a character as to\r\nproduce a sensation of awe, akin to fear. The shadows that enwrapped\r\nthem as they came beneath the buildings, and the fitful gleams of\r\nmoonlight that fell upon them when streets were crossed, seemed not\r\nlights and shadows at all, but strange, intangible things. And when at\r\nlength they reached the outer limit of the village, and the distant\r\nwoods were seen by the moon's rays, our travellers felt as if they had\r\nbeen wandering in a graveyard, where the tombs were houses, and they\r\nwished they were in the swamp again, where such uncanny fancies never\r\ntroubled them. When the toad and lizard, snakes and other loathsome\r\nthings, crawled around their swampy bed, they cared nothing; but the\r\ndead silence of a cloudless night, brooding over a swarm of their\r\nfellow-beings, brought with it a feeling they could not account for or\r\nunderstand; and therefore it was with a sense of great relief they found\r\nthemselves at the outer edge of the town.\r\n\r\nTheir satisfaction, however, was somewhat moderated when, at a sudden\r\nturn of the road, they abruptly came upon a man and a boy, who were\r\npicking their way with such velvety tread that the two parties were face\r\nto face before either was aware of the proximity of the other. The\r\nstrangers appeared to be the more alarmed, for they were just making a\r\nsecret and rapid detour with the view of debouching into a side street,\r\nwhen, feeling sure that none but fugitives would be so anxious to escape\r\nan interview, Glazier hailed them:\r\n\r\n\"Don't be uneasy, boys! We're friends! We're Yankees!\"\r\n\r\nHis conjecture proved correct. The strangers were Captain Bryant, of the\r\nFifth New York Cavalry, and a friend. \"They had,\" says Captain Glazier,\r\n\"a negro guide, who was to secrete them in a hut until the next night,\r\nwhen they were to proceed, as we had done, and reach the line of freedom\r\nby the nearest route.\"\r\n\r\nThe interview was brief, the parties differing as to which was the most\r\nexpedient route, and the discussion terminated by each taking the one he\r\nthought best. Glazier and his comrade made off to a swamp, and upon\r\nsecuring a safe resting-place, were overjoyed to find a venerable sow\r\nand her litter approaching. They greeted the porcine mother, says our\r\nfriend, \"otherwise than did wandering Aeneas the _alba sus_ lying under\r\nthe hollow trees of ancient Italy,\" for, \"enticing them with crumbs of\r\nhoe-cake,\" they both in unison struck a juvenile porker on the head with\r\na heavy stick, and a mammoth knife, the gift of Uncle Zeb, came into\r\nrequisition, and did good service. Over the embers of a fire kindled in\r\na hole in the ground, they roasted the little fellow, and made a\r\ndelicious meal.\r\n\r\nThey had scarcely finished their unexpected feast, when the thud of an\r\naxe in the distance smote on their ears, and Glazier crept cautiously\r\nout to reconnoitre. The wood-cutter proved to be a colored lad, and\r\nhaving a vivid recollection of their scampering friend of \"chicken\"\r\nfame, he hailed him in this wise: \"Hello, Sambo!\"\r\n\r\nThis manner of salute left the party addressed, in doubt as to the\r\ncolors under which the young white stranger served. Off went his hat,\r\ntherefore, and he stood grinning and waiting to hear more. Our hero\r\nwalked quickly up to him, and frankly explained the situation,\r\nconcluding, as usual, with a request for information and aid. Both were\r\npromptly tendered, and shortly after, the fugitives were concealed in a\r\ncorn-fodder house. Here, in the evening, a motley and humorous\r\ndelegation of darkies waited upon them and after ventilating their sage\r\nopinions upon the conduct of the war, organized a prayer-meeting; and,\r\nif the fervor of human prayer availeth, they doubtless damaged the cause\r\nof Secession materially that evening.\r\n\r\nThe topographical knowledge of these well-meaning friends appears to\r\nhave been at fault for had Glazier followed the route they advised,\r\ninstead of striking the railroad running from Charleston to Augusta, on\r\nthe west side of Aiken, which would have enabled them, by pursuing it to\r\nthe westward, to reach Augusta, they would have struck it on the east\r\nside, and consequently by mistake have followed it towards Charleston,\r\nprecisely the place to which they did _not_ want to go.\r\n\r\n\"How far is it, my boy, by this road, to Drainside?\" asked a\r\nmud-splashed traveler of a shrewd lad by the roadside.\r\n\r\n\"If you keep on the way you are heading, and can manage the Atlantic and\r\nPacific on horseback,\" replied the boy, \"it is 23,999 miles. If you turn\r\nyour horse's head and go right back, it is one mile.\"\r\n\r\nOur friends were in a somewhat similar condition. Soon, however, in the\r\ndarkness, they came to a small village, where a freight train was in\r\nwaiting for an early start. They tried to conceal themselves on board\r\nthis train, but very fortunately for their safety they could not find a\r\nhiding-place in or under the cars, and shortly afterwards discovered\r\nthat Charleston was its destination and not Augusta. Had they boarded\r\nthis train they would certainly have been recaptured in Charleston and\r\nsent back to imprisonment. \"A merciful Providence interposed,\" Glazier\r\nwrites. \"Thus 'man proposes,' often to his own ruin, but 'God disposes,'\r\nalways to His own glory, and the good of his creatures.\"\r\n\r\nA blood-hound was on their track in the course of the night, the deep\r\nbayings being plainly audible, but his scent being at fault, the trail\r\nof the fugitives was lost, and he shortly barked himself out of hearing.\r\n\r\nWhen daybreak came and a passenger train filled with rebel soldiers and\r\nrecruits swept past them, setting up a savage yell at sight of the\r\npedestrians, it was feared by the latter that the train might be stopped\r\nwith a view to their capture, so they once more concealed themselves in\r\nthe wood.\r\n\r\nThe sound of heavy cannonading reassured them as to the proximity of\r\nFederal troops; but, where was Augusta? Accurate information on this\r\npoint was absolutely essential before further progress was made; and\r\nLemon was commissioned to obtain it. He was so far successful that he\r\nlearned from some negro wood-choppers--much to the chagrin of both--that\r\nthey had been walking all night in the opposite direction from Augusta,\r\nthat is, on the direct road to Charleston! They also learned, what was\r\nmuch more cheering, that they could cross the Savannah River, at a point\r\ntwenty miles below Augusta, at Point Comfort; that Sherman was making\r\nstraight for Savannah, and therefore their chances of ultimately falling\r\nin with his army were by no means impaired.\r\n\r\nNo time was lost in moving forward in the direction indicated, and\r\nduring the night our hero met with an adventure which we cannot do\r\nbetter than relate in his own words; he says: \"We came to a fork in the\r\nroad, and after debating some time as to which course we should pursue,\r\nI leaped over the fence and made for a negro hut, while several hounds\r\nfrom the plantation house followed hard on my track. I managed, by some\r\ntall running, to come in a few feet ahead, and bolted into the shanty\r\nwithout warning or formality, slamming the door behind me to keep out\r\nthe dogs. A great stupid negro was standing before the fire, his hands\r\nand face buried in fresh pork and hoe-cake, which he was making poor\r\nwork at eating. His broad, fat countenance glistened with an unguent\r\ndistilled partly from within and partly from without. Turning my eyes\r\nfrom the negro to the untidy hearth, they were greeted, as were also my\r\nolfactories, with a skillet of pork frying over the coals.\r\n\r\n\"Without troubling him to answer any questions, I opened the mouth of my\r\nhaversack and poured into it the dripping contents of the skillet. I\r\nnext observed that the ashes on the hearth had a suspiciously fat\r\nappearance, and, taking the tongs, began raking among them. My\r\nsuspicions were verified, for two plump-looking hoe-cakes came to light,\r\nwhich were also deposited in the haversack.\r\n\r\n\"Looking around still farther I saw what I had not observed before,\r\n_Dinah's black head_, as she peered out from among the bed-clothes,\r\nrolling two of the most astonished white eyes that ever asked the\r\nquestion, 'What's you g'wine to do next?' Not seeing any practical way\r\nin which I could answer her mute question, I said to Sambo, 'Call the\r\ndogs into the house.' This he did hastily. I then asked, 'Uncle, what\r\nroad must _this rebel_ take for Tinker Creek?' 'De right han' one, out\r\ndar', I reckon,' he answered. Again bidding him keep the hounds in the\r\nhouse till morning, I rushed out to the road and joined my companion. We\r\nmade lively tracks for about three miles, after which we took it more\r\nleisurely, stopping to rest and refresh ourselves at every stream that\r\ncrossed the road.\"\r\n\r\nThe winter was by this time fairly upon them, and sleeping in the open\r\nair by no means a pleasant experience. They therefore made long marches,\r\nand by the aid of an occasional friendly push from their negro allies at\r\nlength arrived in the vicinity of Point Comfort. This was on the seventh\r\nof December, and the twelfth day of their pilgrimage. After being\r\nsomewhat alarmed by the proximity of a pack of dogs, with which some\r\nboys were hunting, they escaped discovery, and securing another negro\r\nfor a guide, they on the same night found themselves upon the banks of\r\nthe Savannah River.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Escape--crossing The Savannah At Midnight.]\r\n\r\nA colored man's cabin, as usual, sheltered them during the day, and\r\ntheir host and his dusky neighbors (many of whom flocked around to see\r\nthe Yankees, as was their custom) proving to be fishermen well\r\nacquainted with the river, our friends prevailed upon one of their\r\nnumber to undertake the task of carrying them across. The first\r\ndifficulty that presented itself was, where to find a boat; but their\r\nhost remembered, he said, a place upon one of the tributaries of the\r\nSavannah where one lay, not exactly in good sailing trim it is true, for\r\nthe authorities had ordered the destruction of boats along all the\r\nstreams where escaped prisoners were likely to seek a passage, and this\r\ncraft had not escaped their vigilance; but he thought, by the liberal\r\nuse of pitch and cotton, materials easily obtainable in that\r\nneighborhood, it could be made sufficiently water-tight to answer their\r\npurpose. Accordingly, accompanied by their friendly Charon, with his\r\npitch-pot and cotton, they reached the spot indicated and found the\r\nboat.\r\n\r\nIt was in a very dilapidated state, but \"all night long the faithful\r\nfellow worked, caulking and pitching,\" while the fugitives \"lay\r\nconcealed in an old hollow beech log.\"\r\n\r\nIt was long after midnight before he had finished his task, and launched\r\nthe boat into the stream. She looked very shaky, but the extemporized\r\nshipwright reassured them by saying confidently:\r\n\r\n\"She's ready, massa. I'll soon land you in Georgey.\"\r\n\r\nThey were scarcely, however, in the boat before she commenced to leak;\r\nthere was no help for it, so our adventurers betook themselves to\r\nbailing the water out as fast as it entered, and the zealous negro\r\npulled away with all his might. They kept her afloat until within a\r\nshort distance of the wished-for shore, and then, seeing that if they\r\ndid not quit her she would certainly quit them, the two passengers\r\nleaped out, and managed with some difficulty to ascend the beach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PERILS OF AN ESCAPE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Alligators.--A detachment of Southern chivalry.--A scare.--Repairs\r\n    neatly executed.--Misery and despair.--Virtue its own\r\n    reward.--Hunger and desperation.--Audacity.--A Confederate\r\n    officer.--\"A good Union man.\"--\"Two sights and a jambye.\"--A\r\n    narrow escape.\r\n\r\nCaptain Glazier and his companion were not insensible to the danger they\r\nincurred of being drawn under the water by an alligator; animals they\r\nknew to be numerous and voracious in that river, and were therefore not\r\nslow in quitting its banks. So, bidding a hearty good-bye to their\r\nhumble companion, who was already busy re-caulking his boat for the home\r\nvoyage, they once more plunged into the recesses of the swamps,\r\nintending to push forward as far as possible before the morning dawned.\r\n\r\nThey wended their way through a Southern cypress swamp. Some distance\r\nback from the river they could perceive a large plantation-house, with\r\nits out-buildings and accessories, protected by groups of oak and beech;\r\nbut they dared not approach it. Under the far-reaching and sheltering\r\ncypress they pursued their way.\r\n\r\nThe cypress here attains considerable height, the branches issuing from\r\na trunk formed like a cone; but occasionally they are to be seen of very\r\nstunted growth. Around the full-sized tree are frequently to be found a\r\nwhole family of dwarfs, nature having arrested their growth when from\r\none to ten feet high. These would present an unsightly look, were it not\r\nfor the mantle of Spanish moss that envelops, and gives them a graceful\r\nand picturesque appearance.\r\n\r\nLarge alligators lay along the bayous, and on every prostrate log,\r\nwatching the movements of Glazier and his companion. \"They were,\" he\r\nsays, \"apparently pleased at our misfortunes, and sent towards us\r\nloving, hungry glances.\" As soon as approached, these \"wardens of the\r\nmarshes\" would hobble to the edge of a bayou, and allow themselves to\r\nfall in; their eyes remaining above water blinking at the invaders, as\r\nif inviting them to follow. They were probably, as Glazier observes, \"a\r\ndetachment of Southern chivalry doing duty on their own grounds.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, emerging from the swamp they entered a corn-field, and\r\ndiscovered a delicious spring; and not far off, a friendly negro. They\r\narranged to meet him here at eight o'clock, at which hour he returned\r\nand piloted them to some of his friends a short distance off. They were\r\nseveral times upon the point of being discovered--once by a planter, and\r\nagain by a number of white children, who, attended by their nurse, and a\r\npack of curs, approached within a few feet of their hiding-place. Our\r\nfriends gradually edged themselves towards a thicket, which was distant\r\nabout four miles from Briar Creek, the latter being eighteen miles from\r\nMillen--the junction of the Augusta branch and the main line of the\r\nCentral Railway of Georgia.\r\n\r\nAt this thicket, feeling very weary, our fugitives threw themselves on\r\nthe ground, and were soon asleep. Nothing occurred to disturb their\r\nslumber; but, on awaking, their consternation was great to find\r\nthemselves guarded by sentinels! Four large hounds stood looking down\r\nat them with an air of responsibility for their safe-keeping; snuffing\r\noccasionally at their persons to discover, probably, if they had the\r\nscent of game. This indicated an alarming condition of things. And the\r\nfear fell upon them that the owner of the hounds had discovered them\r\nwhile they slept, and they were again prisoners. But their alarm soon\r\nsubsided. No human being appeared; and the dogs seemed to consider their\r\nresponsibility at an end, now that the slumberers were awake; and\r\nwalking around them in the most natural manner, with much show of\r\ndignity, trooped away without even a parting salute, but greatly to the\r\nrelief of our alarmed friends. They were soon after confronted by\r\nanother source of affright. This was the approach of a large cavalry\r\npatrol, which came so near their place of concealment, that they were\r\ncompelled to forego a fire, cold as it was, and eat their sweet potatoes\r\nraw--the only rations left them. They however escaped observation.\r\n\r\nThey knew nothing of the whereabouts of General Sherman; but certain\r\nunmistakable indications satisfied them that they were now approaching\r\nthe scene of military operations. Bridges destroyed, while others were\r\nunder the guard of bodies of soldiers; large herds of stock driven by\r\nthe planters themselves to the recesses of the swamps and forests for\r\nprotection; the hurrying across country of men on horseback and afoot,\r\nand the general appearance of excitement and unrest that prevailed\r\naround them, convinced Glazier and his companion that the formidable\r\nSherman was not very distant.\r\n\r\nIt was hard to be deprived of the comfort of a fire at such an inclement\r\nseason, for the weather had become intensely cold, and rain fell\r\nincessantly. A merciful Providence, however, directed their steps\r\ntowards a spot where an aged negro was cutting wood and warming himself\r\nat a fire by turns, and they were thus enabled to thaw their frozen\r\ngarments and gather some warmth in their numbed limbs. With the aid of\r\nthe old negro, they improvised a rude tent by means of their blankets,\r\nand on leaving for his supper, he promised to return in the evening with\r\nsome hoe-cakes. This promise he faithfully fulfilled, and remained to\r\ncobble Glazier's shoes into a condition of comparative comfort. During\r\nthe day the shoes had threatened to part company with their owner and\r\nleave him barefoot.\r\n\r\nThe aforesaid shoes having been subjected to the process of repair, our\r\nhero at first demurred to their liberal dimensions, but learned, partly\r\nfrom the cobbler and partly from experience, that as the _'possum skin_\r\n(which formed the uppers) began to dry, it acquired the hardness and\r\ndurability of _horn_; and hence, extra space became necessary. The shoes\r\nlasted him till the end of his adventures, and are still preserved as a\r\nmemento of auld lang syne.\r\n\r\nThe following day was passed in the swamp, a wretched, dispiriting,\r\ndrizzling rain, falling from morn till night, bringing the temperature\r\ndown to zero. They recommenced their journey at dark despite the\r\nweather; preferring to push ahead rather than seek shelter again, with\r\ntheir friends, and so delay their progress. Thus they tramped wearily\r\nalong, until the small town of Alexander was reached, and by this time\r\ntheir condition had become so desperate, that they knocked at the first\r\ncabin they came to. A white woman, in reply to their inquiry, as to\r\nwhich was the road to Millen, said \"she did not know.\" And now, for the\r\nfirst time since their escape from Columbia, a feeling of despair took\r\npossession of them. They were cold, hungry, worn out, nearly naked, and\r\nshelterless, and such was their misery and despair, that had they not\r\nsuddenly stumbled upon a large frame building used by negro laborers on\r\nthe railroad, they would have been recaptured from utter powerlessness\r\nto seek concealment, or have fallen by the wayside and died.\r\n\r\nHere, however, they met with a generous reception, and obtained the\r\ninformation they sought. After exchanging some kind words with these\r\nhumble people, who heartily sympathized with them, Glazier and his\r\ncomrade proceeded on their way.\r\n\r\nEverything went well until they unexpectedly came to the banks of a\r\nconsiderable stream, and, after a careful search, failed to discover any\r\npracticable means of crossing it, except by fording. The fact of its\r\nbeing fordable gave rise to an incident with a _moral_, and as the\r\ngallant captain relates the story we will quote his own words:\r\n\r\n\"Sitting,\" he writes, \"on a log, and ruminating over our chances, a very\r\nselfish piece of strategy suggested itself. Accordingly, I said to\r\nLemon, 'There is no use of both getting wet; we can carry each other\r\nover these streams. If you will carry me over this, I will carry you\r\nover the next,' I said, 'these streams,' although only one was before\r\nus, and the most prominent thought in my mind was that, in all\r\nprobability, there would be no other.\r\n\r\n\"Lemon somehow failed to see the point, and consented. Accordingly,\r\ntaking off our shoes, I mounted on the lieutenant's shoulders, as\r\nschool-boys sometimes carry each other, and he staggered through the\r\nstream with me, doing no worse than wetting my feet. This worked well.\r\nI congratulated myself, and gave a generous sympathy to Lemon in his\r\nshiverings. The chances were ten to one, I thought, that the carrying\r\nbusiness was at an end, when suddenly another stream, wider than the\r\nfirst, rose up in the darkness before us. There was no use in wincing,\r\nand I stripped for the task. The lieutenant ascended to the position he\r\nhad fairly earned. I plunged into the water. The middle of the stream\r\nwas reached in safety, when, through no fault of mine, either the water\r\nbecame too deep, or my back became too weak for the burden, and the\r\nconsequence was, the worthy gentleman was nearly as well soaked as\r\nmyself when we reached the opposite shore. Selfishness, as well as\r\nvirtue, sometimes brings its own reward.\"\r\n\r\nThey crossed three other streams during the night, but, by mutual\r\nconsent, the carrying contract was canceled, and each did his own\r\nwading. \"Thus,\" adds the captain, \"another grand scheme for human\r\nelevation fell to the ground!\"\r\n\r\nWeary and wet to the skin, they persevered in their onward course, until\r\nthey reached another cypress swamp, and discovered a road through it,\r\nwhich had evidently been the scene of a recently fought battle. Fences\r\nand buildings were razed to the ground, while fragments of military\r\nequipments were scattered about profusely--broken muskets, spent\r\ncartridges, and dead cattle; all told the story of a late conflict.\r\n\r\nOur fugitives had no means of learning at the time any particulars of\r\nthe supposed fight, but were afterward informed that less than a week\r\nprevious to their being on the spot, General Kilpatrick's cavalry and\r\nthe Seventeenth Army Corps had swept like an avalanche along that road.\r\n\r\nThe temperature by this time had somewhat moderated, and Glazier and his\r\ncompanion, thinking it unlikely the road would be much used for a time,\r\nconcluded that they might with safety lie down and obtain some necessary\r\nrest and sleep. In their exhausted condition, they slept through the day\r\nand the greater part of the following night, arousing themselves with\r\ndifficulty for the work still before them.\r\n\r\nJudging from the fact that many of the dead horses seen on the road bore\r\nthe brand of the \"United States,\" and from other indications, they\r\narrived at the conclusion that the Union forces were not very distant,\r\nand that they themselves were now possibly in the wake of Sherman's\r\narmy. This being the case, the hope revived in their breasts of soon\r\njoining their friends--unless they had the misfortune to be picked up by\r\nthe enemy's scouts. Hence, having lost so much of the night, they\r\ndecided to travel this time by day, and at once put their determination\r\ninto practice. Glazier and his friend soon discovered, however, that\r\nthey were not expedited in their journey to any great extent--the\r\nstreams being greatly swollen by the recent rains, formed a serious\r\nobstacle to their further progress.\r\n\r\nThey also felt that traveling by daylight was attended with much hazard\r\nto their safety. One advantage of journeying through a part of the\r\ncountry lately traversed by an invading army, was found in the fact of\r\nthere being much smouldering fire along their line of march, and thus\r\nour friends ran no risk of attracting attention by approaching these\r\nfires at their several halting-places. This circumstance afforded one\r\nelement of comfort--_warmth_. But another, still more important, was\r\nlacking, namely--_food_.\r\n\r\nThey had traveled the entire day without meeting a single negro, and\r\nhence, their commissariat was _non est_, and gaunt hunger created in\r\nthem a sense of desperation. In this state they reached, after sunset, a\r\nplantation, where no house appeared but a number of humble shanties;\r\nand, weary, starving and desperate, they boldly advanced to the door of\r\nthe best-looking cabin, and knocked for admission.\r\n\r\n\"Who's thar?\" was answered in a tone, common to the poor whites and\r\nblacks of that section, that afforded no indication of the color of the\r\nspeaker. That, however, was the first thing to determine before\r\nproceeding further. So our hero replied, interrogatively: \"Are you black\r\nor white in there?\" \"Thar aint no niggahs heah,\" was the response, and\r\nthe indignant tone of its delivery placed it beyond doubt that they had\r\nfallen upon a family of \"poor whites.\" Glazier thereupon changed his\r\nvoice to that of the \"high-toned\" rebel, and asked why he kept an\r\nofficer of the Confederate army waiting for admittance. The man\r\nreluctantly opened the door, and the _soi-disant_ Confederate demanded\r\nin an imperious tone, \"How long is it since our army passed here?\"\r\n\r\n\"What army?\" was the cautious query, before an answer was vouchsafed.\r\n\r\n\"Why the rebel army, of course!\"\r\n\r\nThe man hereupon stated that Wheeler's cavalry had passed by a week\r\nbefore, following Sherman's rear guard.\r\n\r\n\"How far is it to General Wheeler's headquarters?\" asked Lieutenant\r\nGlazier.\r\n\r\n\"I dun'no!\" growled the other; \"but I guess it's a right smart\r\ndistance.\"\r\n\r\nTo other questions, as to the possibility of obtaining one or more\r\nhorses and mules, and even a suggestion that something to eat would not\r\nbe unwelcome, the fellow protested that the ---- Yankees had stripped\r\nthe country of everything, and left them neither horses, mules, nor\r\nanything to eat. Through the intervention of his wife, however, Glazier\r\nfinally obtained some bread and sweet potatoes; and, delivering a\r\nlecture to him upon the gross ingratitude of treating in such a\r\nniggardly manner a soldier who had left a home of opulence and comfort,\r\nto battle for _his_ rights and liberties, with much more of a similar\r\naudacious character, he left the house.\r\n\r\nTime, however, was too precious to be wasted, and, at the conclusion of\r\nthe meal, they hurriedly resumed their march.\r\n\r\nA solitary planter passed them, returning their carefully-worded\r\nsalutation, and, evidently mistaking them for Confederates, volunteered\r\nthe information that \"our cavalry\"--meaning Wheeler's, had passed that\r\npoint last Tuesday. He was barely out of view, when they overtook a\r\ncouple of negroes going to their work; and of them Glazier inquired the\r\ndistance to the nearest plantation, receiving for answer, \"Jess a mile,\r\nmassa.\" \"Are there any white folks there?\" asked our hero. \"Narry one,\r\nmassa,\" was the reply; adding, \"Dat ar planter is what dey call a\r\nBeeswaxer\"--meaning a Bushwacker, \"and Massa Sherman took dem all orf.\"\r\nNot wishing to commit themselves by imprudently revealing their true\r\ncharacter, Glazier asked them indifferently, if they had seen any of\r\nWheeler's cavalry lately. To which one of them responded, \"Dar's right\r\nsmart of dem down at Mars' Brown's, free mile from de swamp, and dey's\r\nhazin' de country all 'round.\"\r\n\r\nThis intelligence was not encouraging, but our friends thought it the\r\nwiser course to proceed at once to the plantation the negro had\r\ndescribed. They soon reached the place, and, finding that the dwelling\r\nof the owner was closed, they, without delay, advanced to the nearest of\r\nthe smaller tenements, such as were usually occupied by slaves.\r\n\r\nGlazier did not pause to knock at the door, but boldly raised the latch\r\nand entered. He expected to see the usual negro auntie with her brood of\r\npickaninnies, or to meet the friendly glance of one of the males, and\r\ntherefore walked in very confidently, and with a pleasant smile. This,\r\nhowever, soon changed to a look of amazement, when he found himself face\r\nto face with a Confederate officer in full uniform. Quick as lightning,\r\nour hero determined upon his course.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, sir!\" he exclaimed, with all the coolness he could assume, \"I\r\nperceive we are in the same service. I can only hope you have not been\r\nso unfortunate as myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"How unfortunate may you have been, sir?\" the _vis a vis_ inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Why, at the late cavalry fight at Waynesboro', I lost my horse, having\r\nhim shot under me. I have not had the good fortune to obtain another,\r\nand the consequence is, that I have been compelled to walk the whole\r\ndistance to this point.\"\r\n\r\n\"I reckon, then, stranger, our cases are not altogether dissimilar,\" the\r\nConfederate rejoined; \"I had my horse killed there, too, but luckily got\r\na mule.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Mutual Surprise.]\r\n\r\nIn anticipation of an inquiry which, if addressed to himself, might lead\r\nto unpleasant complications, Glazier now asked: \"What command he was\r\nattached to?\" \"Forty-third Alabama Mounted Infantry,\" said the other;\r\nand then put a similar question. \"Third South Carolina Cavalry,\" said\r\nGlazier, feeling that he would be more at home as a trooper than an\r\ninfantry soldier. To carry out his assumed character, he added some\r\nremarks regarding Sherman's barbarities, and was just congratulating\r\nhimself upon the gullibility of the Confederate, when his apprehensions\r\nwere revived by a remark, that it was \"strange a rebel officer should be\r\ndressed in a Federal uniform.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all, sir,\" was the quick response, \"a poor fellow must wear what\r\nhe can get in times like these. I have not had a full equipment since I\r\nentered the service, and hang me, if I ever expect to get one. In the\r\nfight at Waynesboro' we captured a few Yanks, and I just stripped one\r\nfellow after he died, and took his clothes.\"\r\n\r\nThis explanation appeared to satisfy the rebel officer, as he remarked,\r\n\"that was a good idea, and I wish I had been as sensible myself.\" After\r\ninquiry about the probability of obtaining some \"grub\" from the auntie,\r\nwhose hut he supposed the place to be, and receiving a discouraging\r\nreply, Glazier was advised to call upon a Mr. Brown. The property of\r\nthis _loyal_ gentleman had been protected from seizure by General\r\nSherman, on account of his having claimed to be a \"good Union man,\" and\r\nby General Wheeler, because he was a \"good rebel,\" and his larder was\r\ndescribed to be, in consequence, well stocked. Our hero prepared to\r\ndepart, first earnestly inquiring the road to Mr. Brown's residence.\r\n\r\n\"About two sights and a jambye,\" said the Alabamian, which interpreted,\r\nmeant, twice as far as they could see, and the width of a swamp.\r\n\r\nHaving obtained all the information he desired, without the remotest\r\nintention of availing himself of the \"good Union man's\" hospitality,\r\nGlazier said \"good-day,\" and rejoined his friend. They made the best of\r\ntheir way along a path, until a turn carried them out of the rebel\r\nofficer's sight, then wheeled suddenly round, and ran rapidly for a\r\nconsiderable distance in the opposite direction to Mr. Brown's.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECAPTURED BY A CONFEDERATE OUTPOST.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Fugitive slaves.--A rebel planter.--The Big Ebenezer.--A sound of\r\n    oars.--A _ruse de guerre_.--Burial of a dead soldier.--A free\r\n    ride.--Groping in the dark.--\"Who goes there!\"--Recaptured.--_Nil\r\n    desperandum._--James Brooks.--Contraband of war.--Confederate\r\n    murders.--In the saddle again.--A dash for freedom.--Again\r\n    captured.--Tried as a spy.\r\n\r\nOur hero had been somewhat impressed with the subdued tone and manner of\r\nthe Confederate officer with whom he had lately parted. To some extent\r\nhe manifested a discouraged and cowed bearing, and this, taken with some\r\nother circumstances in their recent experience, led our friends to hope\r\nthat the end was not very remote.\r\n\r\nAfter bidding adieu to the Confederate, they walked about two miles\r\nbefore discovering a place of concealment in another swamp. Here they\r\nunexpectedly came upon a party of negroes sleeping around a large fire.\r\nThey proved to be fugitive slaves, who had abandoned their homes in\r\nBurke County, Georgia, to follow in the rear of Sherman's army. They had\r\nformed part of a body of several hundred persons of all ages and both\r\nsexes, who had escaped and sought refuge upon an island in Big Ebenezer\r\nCreek, and had been inhumanly shelled out by the Confederates. Thence\r\nthey had scattered over the country in small bands, and the present\r\ndetached party were working their way back to their masters. Captain\r\nGlazier despatched one of them with a haversack in search of some food\r\namong the resident colored people, and the result was so far\r\nsatisfactory that our friends were put in possession of a good supply of\r\nsweet potatoes.\r\n\r\nAfter another march, and while still in the swamp, they heard\r\nwood-choppers, and Lemon started to reconnoitre. Guided by the sound of\r\nthe axe, he approached a small clearing, and seeing a negro, as he had\r\nexpected, wielding the axe, walked forward to him, but was suddenly\r\nstartled by observing a burly white man sitting on a log, smoking and\r\nlooking on. They eyed each other for a moment in silence, when presently\r\nthe planter demanded in a blustering voice, \"What are you doing here, in\r\na blue uniform?\" Lemon was not slow to answer in a corresponding tone,\r\n\"I am serving my country, as every loyal man should do: what have _you_\r\nto say about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe you're a d----d Yankee,\" said the planter. \"You're welcome to\r\nyour opinion, old Blowhard,\" responded Lemon. \"This is a free country; I\r\n_am_ a Yankee--all but the d----d--and now what do you propose to do about\r\nit?\" (All this in an assumed tone of bluster, as the best adapted to the\r\nsituation.) \"We'll see! we'll see!\" rejoined the planter, and at once\r\nstarted in a direct line for his house. Lemon lost no time, but returned\r\nas quickly as possible to his comrade, and without any deliberation they\r\nevacuated the enemy's country with as much expedition as their tired\r\nlegs were capable of exerting. Their ears were soon saluted with the\r\nmusic of a pack of hounds let loose on their track by the burly rebel,\r\nand the affair would have had a disastrous ending if they had not\r\nopportunely encountered a considerable stream, and by wading through it\r\nfor nearly a mile, succeeded in cutting off the scent of the hounds.\r\n\r\nThe planter had raised a hue and cry for miles around, and our hunted\r\nfriends, from their covert, saw mounted men patrolling the corduroy road\r\nthrough the swamp, seemingly under the belief that the \"Yankees\" would\r\nbe driven to use this highway eventually, and thus fall an easy prey\r\ninto their hands. The man-hunters, however, found themselves at fault,\r\nfor our hero had learned, in the hard school of experience, to\r\nanticipate all such contingencies. He and Lemon therefore secreted\r\nthemselves until late in the night, determined to rob them of their\r\ngame.\r\n\r\nIt was approaching midnight, December fifteenth, when the fugitives\r\ncrept cautiously to the margin of the swamp. A large fire denoted the\r\nposition of the planter's picket. They ventured out through the mud and\r\nwater with the purpose of flanking the enemy on their left--a hazardous\r\nproceeding, and attended with much suffering from the intense coldness\r\nof the water. In two hours, however, they had reached a point on the\r\nopposite side of the encampment, and fearing discovery and pursuit, soon\r\nplaced two or three miles between themselves and the foe. Sometimes they\r\nwere made cognizant of the nearness of the parties in search of them, by\r\noverhearing their conversation, which treated mainly of Sherman's march\r\nto the sea, how it would affect the Confederacy, and similar interesting\r\ntopics.\r\n\r\nOur friends passed the last picket at the edge of the swamp, but deeming\r\nit unwise to relax in speed or vigilance, pushed forward to the banks of\r\nthe Big Ebenezer, which advanced them three miles further.\r\n\r\nHere, upon the charred abutment of a burned bridge, Glazier and his\r\nfriend paused, and with the dark river in their front, debated how they\r\nwere to reach the other side. The dawn was just breaking, and through\r\nthe rising mist they could discern the opposite shore, but no\r\npracticable mode of reaching it. They must not, however, remain here\r\nafter daybreak, and therefore sought and found a place of concealment,\r\nagain in the hateful swamp, but not far from the river's bank. They were\r\nsoon enjoying the rest and sleep of the weary.\r\n\r\nLemon was startled from his slumber by a sound resembling that of oars.\r\nHe awoke Glazier, and both listened intently, at a loss to understand\r\nthe meaning of such a sound in such a place. In a few minutes the noise\r\nceased, and looking cautiously from their hiding-place, they observed\r\ntwo men pass near them, having the appearance of messengers or couriers,\r\nwith despatches, which they could plainly see in their hands. It at once\r\noccurred to our hero and his companion that the boat in which these men\r\nhad rowed themselves up the river, could be made available for crossing\r\nto its opposite bank. They found it moored to a tree, and at once\r\nembarked and crossed the stream. To prevent pursuit they cast the boat\r\nadrift, and as speedily as possible left \"Big Ebenezer\" behind them.\r\n\r\nAt a short distance from the river side Lemon stumbled over the dead\r\nbody of a soldier, which, upon examination, proved to be that of a\r\nFederal. Our friends having no means of placing the body underground,\r\nconcluded to bury it in the river, and thus prevent to some extent its\r\ndesecration by dogs or other carrion-seeking animals that might find it\r\nexposed. This was the best they could do under the circumstances, and\r\nthus the poor body found a sailor's, if not a soldier's grave.\r\n\r\nThey had advanced not many paces again when they discovered two horses\r\ntied to a tree, possibly the property of the two couriers whose boat\r\nthey had previously utilized. These they looked upon as fair spoil in an\r\nenemy's country, and with little compunction and less ceremony mounted\r\nand started on their way. A few miles brought them to the verge of the\r\nwood, and the day was now breaking. They therefore reluctantly\r\ndismounted, turned their steeds adrift for fear of detection, and\r\ntrudged forward on foot once more.\r\n\r\nSoon they had reason to congratulate themselves on their prudence in\r\ndismounting. Another quarter of a mile brought within view a Confederate\r\npicket, but they were not themselves observed. They accordingly sought a\r\nhiding-place among the thick undergrowth, and were soon asleep,\r\nremaining so until midnight. They then turned the flank of the picket\r\nand proceeded on their journey.\r\n\r\nLong immunity from the peril of recapture had now inspired Glazier and\r\nhis friend with hope and full confidence in successfully attaining the\r\nend of their struggles. The swamp, the river, the alligator, the\r\nman-hunter, and worse than all, the blood-hound, had been met and\r\nsuccessfully overcome or evaded; and after three long weeks of travel\r\nfrom the execrable and inhuman people, who had held them as prisoners of\r\nwar, and treated them worse than dogs, they now found themselves within\r\ntwenty miles of Savannah.\r\n\r\nResting himself upon a fallen tree, clad in rags, hungry and reduced\r\nalmost to the proportions of a skeleton by long fasting, Glazier with\r\nhis companion were able to congratulate themselves upon their wonderful\r\npreservation thus far. All seemed to foreshadow their final triumph, and\r\ntheir spirits were cheered, notwithstanding that food had not passed\r\ntheir lips for the past thirty-six hours, with the exception of a few\r\ngrains of corn picked up by the way. Probably within the brief space of\r\ntwenty-four hours they would be again free and under the protection of\r\nthe glorious flag, in whose defence they had fought and suffered so\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\nFlushed with their past success and elated with hope for the future they\r\nrecommenced their march. They had no exact information as to the\r\nposition of the Federal army, and were in fact groping their way in the\r\ndark--figuratively as well as literally--every sense on the alert to\r\navoid the enemy's picket lines.\r\n\r\nOn reaching Little Ebenezer Creek about midnight they were chagrined to\r\nfind the bridge destroyed, but after reconnoitring for a time, were\r\nsatisfied that the coast was clear on the opposite side. Finding some\r\nbroken planks they constructed a raft and paddled themselves across the\r\nstream.\r\n\r\nThey were now on the Savannah River Road, over which Kilpatrick's\r\ncavalry and the Fourteenth Army Corps had passed but a week before. Old\r\ncamping-grounds were numerous along their way, and each was examined\r\nclosely for any bread or other eatables they thought might have been\r\nleft by the army.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Recaptured By A Confederate Outpost.]\r\n\r\nThey were closely engaged in this search, when \"Who comes there?\" was\r\ngruffly shouted by a voice near them.\r\n\r\n\"Friends,\" promptly answered Glazier.\r\n\r\n\"Advance one!\" commanded the picket.\r\n\r\n\"I advanced promptly,\" writes Captain Glazier, in the history of his\r\ncapture and imprisonment, \"and arriving near my captors found them to be\r\nmounted infantry. They were sitting upon their horses in the shade of\r\nsome cypress-trees. One asked, 'Who are you?' to which I replied, 'A\r\nscout to General Hardie, and must not be detained, as I have important\r\ninformation for the general.'\r\n\r\n\"The picket replied, 'I'm instructed to take every person to the officer\r\nof the picket that approaches this post after dark.'\r\n\r\n\"'I can't help it, sir. It is not customary to arrest scouts, and I must\r\npass on.'\r\n\r\n\"'You cannot; I must obey orders. I do not doubt the truth of your\r\nassertion; but until you have seen the lieutenant, you will not be\r\nallowed to pass this post.'\r\n\r\n\"Finding that I had met a good soldier I saw that it was useless to\r\ntrifle with him, and tried to console myself with the thought that I\r\nshould be able to dupe the officer; and as we were hurried on towards\r\nthe reserve of the picket my mind was occupied in arranging a plan for\r\nour defence, as spies to the great rebel chief. Arrived at the reserve\r\nwe found nearly all asleep, including the lieutenant, in close proximity\r\nto a large rail-fire.\r\n\r\n\"A little rough shaking soon roused him up, and, rubbing his eyes, he\r\nasked, 'What's wanted?'\r\n\r\n\"I quickly answered, 'I'm surprised, sir, that scouts to our generals\r\nshould be arrested by your picket.'\r\n\r\n\"He said, 'My instructions are positive, and no man can pass this post\r\nwithout examination.'\r\n\r\n\"'Very well, then,' I said, 'be good enough to examine us at once.'\r\n\r\n\"'Have you passes?'\r\n\r\n\"'No, sir; not at present. We had papers when we left the general's\r\nheadquarters; but having been scouting in Northern Georgia, for the past\r\ntwo weeks, our papers are worn out and lost.'\r\n\r\n\"'You have some papers about you, I suppose?'\r\n\r\n\"Thinking that by answering in the affirmative, and producing quickly an\r\nold package of letters which had been received while in Libby Prison,\r\nthat none of them would be examined, I hastily drew them from the\r\nside-pocket of my jacket and held them before me, saying, 'I hope here\r\nare enough, sir.'\r\n\r\n\"The lieutenant's curiosity led him to take one which had been received\r\nfrom Colonel Clarence Buel, of Troy, New York. He held it near the fire,\r\nand noticing the date, turned his eyes towards me and again to the\r\nletter; the second glance seemed to satisfy him that I was not a rebel,\r\nand he remarked very indignantly, 'Then you are scouting for General\r\nHardie, are you? I believe you are a d----d Yankee spy! and if you were\r\nto get your deserts I should hang you to the first tree I come to,' Said\r\nI, 'Lieutenant, do not be too hasty. I can convince you that I have been a\r\nprisoner of war, and if you are a true soldier I shall be treated as\r\nsuch.'\r\n\r\n\"Becoming a little more mild he gave us to understand that we should\r\nstart at ten o'clock the next morning for Springfield, the headquarters\r\nof General Wheeler.\r\n\r\n\"After detailing a special guard for the prisoners, and instructing them\r\nto be on the alert, the lieutenant laid himself down by the fire,\r\nleaving us to reflect upon the hardness of fate, and the uncertainties\r\nattending an effort to escape the clutches of a vigilant enemy.\"\r\n\r\nGlazier did not despair, but at the first opportunity communicated to\r\nLemon his determination to reach the Federal lines at all risks; he\r\nwould never return to South Carolina a prisoner; the horrors of\r\nprison-life and the privations and sufferings they had already endured,\r\nshould never be repeated in his case, but rather--welcome death! Their\r\nenemies--albeit fellow-countrymen and _Americans_--were inhuman and\r\nbarbarous, and before putting himself in their hands again, he would\r\nsubmit to be hung by bushwhackers, or torn to pieces by blood-hounds.\r\nTheir case was now desperate, and for his part he would take the first\r\nchance that offered of getting away. Our hero thought he could count on\r\nLemon's concurrence and co-operation. The men of the picket told him\r\nthey had been arrested at the outpost; and it was now clear that if the\r\nfugitives had been so fortunate as to pass this picket, they could have\r\nreached the Federal lines in less than an hour. Only a step intervened\r\nbetween captivity and freedom--the thought was very disheartening.\r\n\r\nAn instance of exceptional kindness on the part of a Confederate must\r\nnot be omitted here. James Brooks, one of the picket, came to the\r\nprisoners and invited them to partake of some hoe-cake and bacon. He\r\nsaid he had been out foraging, and would share his plunder with them.\r\nHaving been without food for forty-eight hours, save a few ears of\r\ncorn, they eagerly embraced the generous offer. The hoe-cake was\r\nproduced and partaken of ravenously and thankfully. The other men of the\r\npicket were disgusted at the liberality of their comrade, calling him a\r\n\"blue belly,\" and a fool to give good bread to a couple of d----d Yanks.\r\nLike a true man, however, he made no reply to their brutal taunts, and\r\ngave the captives a most excellent breakfast.\r\n\r\nHaving finished their welcome meal, they asked permission to bathe\r\nthemselves, under guard, in a little stream not many rods from the\r\nreserve, which request was granted. Here the prisoners in their\r\ndesperation offered the guard one hundred dollars in Confederate scrip,\r\nwhich had been given them by their negro friends, to assist them in\r\nmaking their escape. The guards seemed to distrust each other, and\r\ndeclined the proposal. They, however, said they would be right glad to\r\nhave the money, but feared to take it, as they were held responsible for\r\nthe safe return of the prisoners. The offer of the bribe was reported to\r\nthe lieutenant, who at once ordered the delinquents to be searched, and\r\nall the scrip found upon them was confiscated, as contraband of war, and\r\nappropriated to rebel uses, leaving our two unfortunate friends\r\npenniless. They were further threatened with condign punishment for\r\noffering to bribe the guard. One said \"Shoot them;\" another, \"Let 'em\r\nstretch hemp;\" several recommended that they be taken to the swamp and\r\n\"sent after Sherman's raiders,\"--referring, probably, to the manner in\r\nwhich they had disposed of some of the Federal sick, who had been left\r\nin the rear of the army. Of this incident Glazier writes: \"I had been\r\ntold by the negroes that fifteen of our sick, who fell into the\r\nhands of the rebels but a few days before our recapture, were taken to a\r\nswamp, where their throats were cut, and their bodies thrown into a\r\nslough hole. I cannot vouch for the truth of this statement, but it came\r\nto me from many whose veracity I have no reason to question.\"\r\n\r\nLet us in the name of humanity doubt it!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Escape And Pursuit.]\r\n\r\nAt ten o'clock A. M. a mounted guard, consisting of a corporal and two\r\nmen, were detailed to march the prisoners to the headquarters of General\r\nWheeler. They had not proceeded far when Glazier assumed to be footsore,\r\nand pleaded his utter inability to walk any further. Believing this, one\r\nof the guards dismounted and helped him into the saddle. Our hero was no\r\nsooner mounted than he decided that, come what would, he would make his\r\nescape. In a few moments the guard who was on foot espied a black\r\nsquirrel darting across the road, and oblivious of his responsibility,\r\ngave chase to it, Glazier looking on and biding his time. The squirrel\r\nsoon ran up a tree, and leaped from bough to bough with its usual\r\nagility. Suddenly it halted on a prominent branch, seeming to bid\r\ndefiance to its pursuer. The carbine was instantly raised, and\r\ndischarged. Without waiting to note the result, Glazier, feeling that\r\n_now_ was his opportunity, dashed off at a gallop, urging his horse to\r\nthe top of his speed. Before the squirrel-hunter could reload, he was\r\nmany yards away. The corporal in charge fired his revolver, and at each\r\ndischarge of the weapon, shouted to the fugitive to halt! but Glazier\r\ngave no heed to the summons, and might have succeeded in reaching the\r\nswamps and defied recapture, if he had not unfortunately galloped into a\r\nrebel camp! Baffled, he turned his horse, and endeavored to cross an\r\nopen field, but the corporal continued to shout, \"Halt that d----d\r\nYankee!\" when a body of Texan Rangers from General Iverson's cavalry\r\ndivision, some mounted and some dismounted, gave chase, hooting and\r\nyelping, and finally overtook and compelled him to surrender.\r\n\r\nThe guard whose horse Lieutenant Glazier had ridden came up and vented\r\nhis rage at the escapade in no measured language. The Texans, however,\r\nenjoyed the fun of the thing, and laughed at, and ridiculed him. Said\r\none, \"You are a d----d smart soldier to let a blue-belly get away from\r\nyou--and on your own horse too!\" Another joined in with, \"Say, Corporal,\r\nwhich of them nags can run fastest?\" Nothing of course was said about\r\nthe _squirrel_!\r\n\r\nOn Lemon and his guard coming up they resumed their march to\r\nheadquarters--Glazier's lameness exciting no further sympathy, nor the\r\noffer of another mount.\r\n\r\nThe escort with their charge reached General Wheeler's headquarters in\r\nthe afternoon, and the report handed in stated that, \"the two prisoners\r\nhad been captured while attempting to pass the out-post, under the\r\npretence of being scouts to General Hardie.\"\r\n\r\nWheeler ordered them at once into his presence and questioned them\r\nclosely.\r\n\r\nCaptain Glazier thus graphically relates the interview:\r\n\r\n\"'Then you are scouting for Confederate generals?' said Wheeler.\r\n\r\n\"I replied, 'We would have rejoiced if we could have convinced your\r\nout-post that we were.'\r\n\r\n\"'None of your impudence, sir! Remember that you are a prisoner.'\r\n\r\n\"'Very true; but when you ask questions, you must expect answers.'\r\n\r\n\"'What are you doing with that gray jacket?'\r\n\r\n\"'I wear it, sir, to protect myself from the sun and storm.'\r\n\r\n\"'Where did you get it?'\r\n\r\n\"'One of the guards at Columbia was kind enough to give it to me, when\r\nhe saw that I was suffering for the want of clothing to cover my\r\nnakedness.'\r\n\r\n\"'He could not have been a true rebel, to assist a Yankee in making his\r\nescape.'\r\n\r\n\"'He knew nothing of my intention to escape; and I believe he was at\r\nleast a kind-hearted man.'\r\n\r\n\"'Why don't you wear the Federal uniform? Are the Yankees ashamed of\r\nit?'\r\n\r\n\"'By no means, sir! What few garments were spared me at the time of my\r\ncapture were worn out during a long imprisonment, and the clothing which\r\nwas sent on to Richmond by our Government during the winter of 1863 for\r\ndistribution among the prisoners, was, for the most part, appropriated\r\nby your authorities.'\r\n\r\n\"'Like most of your contemptible Yankee crew, I believe you to be a\r\nlying scoundrel, and you shall answer to the charge of spy.'\r\n\r\n\"'Very well, sir, I am compelled to await your pleasure; but you have\r\nheard nothing but the truth.'\r\n\r\n\"'Guard! take the prisoners to the jail, place them in a cell, and keep\r\nthem in close confinement until further orders.'\"\r\n\r\nThe above colloquy between Wheeler and his prisoners reflects small\r\ncredit upon him as a leader of \"Southern Chivalry.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINAL ESCAPE FROM CAPTIVITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In jail.--White trash.--Yankees.--Off to Waynesboro.--No rations.\r\n    Calling the roll.--Sylvania.--Plan for escape.--Lieutenant John\r\n    W.

They were the only military prisoners confined\r\nthere, and were allowed the privilege of leaving their cell and going\r\ninto the yard for fresh air. They were not a little amused by the crowds\r\nof wondering citizens who visited the jail to view the \"two live Yanks.\"\r\n\r\nThese worthy citizens were greatly exercised that the prisoners should\r\nbe permitted to leave their cells, and called on the jailer to remove\r\nthem from the yard or they would take the keys into their own hands; but\r\nthe officer in command told them that he was personally responsible for\r\ntheir safe-custody, and refused to remove them. These white Georgians\r\nwere a very primitive class of people. Utterly illiterate and\r\nuninformed, their mode of speech was as bad as that of the most ignorant\r\nslaves on the plantations. The term \"white trash,\" whatever its origin,\r\nwas a most appropriate designation. No care had been taken to educate\r\nthem--no school-houses built; education being confined to the few whose\r\nwealth enabled them to send their children to Northern schools, or to\r\nengage a private tutor. Discovering that the prisoners were harmless,\r\nmany of these people asked them questions of a curious and comical\r\nnature. They thought Yankees were imps of darkness, possessed of horns\r\nand hoof, and, seeing that the prisoners were formed not unlike\r\nthemselves, were with difficulty persuaded that they were \"Yankees.\"\r\nTheir idea of the causes and character of the war was ludicrous in the\r\nextreme, and will hardly bear description--the negroes themselves being\r\nfar better informed upon this, as they were upon most other subjects.\r\n\r\nA very brief examination before a hastily convened board of officers\r\nresulted in a finding that the captives were \"escaped prisoners of war,\"\r\nand not \"spies.\" They were accordingly asked, where they were captured,\r\nwhere imprisoned, when they escaped, etc.; and then a strong guard from\r\nthe Second Georgia Cavalry was detailed to convey them, with fifteen\r\nother prisoners from the Fourteenth Army Corps, to Waynesboro.\r\n\r\nFrom the other prisoners Glazier gleaned much useful information\r\nconcerning the situation of the Union lines, and also learned where the\r\nrebel troops were stationed in Sherman's rear. Should he attempt another\r\nescape, this knowledge would be valuable. The rebel escort cared very\r\nlittle for the wants of their prisoners, and issued no rations whatever\r\nto them--they themselves being entirely dependent on foraging for their\r\nown supplies. As the unfortunate prisoners could not forage for\r\nthemselves they had to go without, a condition of things that spoke\r\nlittle for the soldierly feeling of the guard. All attempts to elude the\r\nvigilance of the latter during the day had failed, and as darkness drew\r\non, Glazier and his friend felt in very low spirits. They came to a halt\r\na few minutes before dark, and were quartered in an old building for the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nIn passing through a large swamp, just before halting, the water was so\r\ndeep that each man had to wade through as he best could. The guard\r\nexerted themselves to their utmost to keep them together, but in spite\r\nof their efforts to do so, one of the prisoners fell out, and his\r\nabsence was overlooked by the sergeant, although noticed by his\r\nfellow-prisoners, who succeeded in convincing the sergeant that all were\r\npresent. The mode was this: Glazier found out the absent man's name, and\r\nthen volunteered to call the roll from a list in the sergeant's\r\npossession. It being dark, a piece of pitch-pine was lighted, and the\r\nlist handed to Glazier, who proceeded to call the names. All answered,\r\nexcept the absentee, when, according to previous arrangement, each\r\naffirmed that no such man had been among them. The sergeant sapiently\r\nconcluded that the name had found its way upon the roster by some error,\r\nand nothing further was said about it. Had this little ruse not been\r\nresorted to, great efforts would have been made to recover the fugitive.\r\nPicked men would have been detailed, hounds called out from the nearest\r\nplantation, and a very short time would have convinced the unfortunate\r\nvictim how little hope there was for him who sought to shun the horrors\r\nof prison-life by an escape.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Escape From Sylvania, Georgia--running The Guard.]\r\n\r\nWe do not propose entering into any detail of this march into captivity,\r\nmore especially as our hero has himself fully and graphically described\r\nit in his \"Capture, Prison-Pen and Escape,\" compiled from a diary kept\r\nduring the whole period of his adventurous career, and published in\r\n1865. We will merely state here that on Monday, December nineteenth,\r\n1864, after a dreary march of twenty-five miles, the captives found\r\nthemselves encamped for the night at the little village of Sylvania,\r\nGeorgia; half-way between the point of their departure and that of their\r\ndestination, Waynesboro.\r\n\r\nGlazier's mind, during the whole of the day, had been preoccupied with\r\nbut one subject--_how to escape!_--this problem excluding every other\r\nthought or consideration of himself or his surroundings.\r\n\r\nEarly in the evening the prisoners were stationed on the porch of a\r\nlarge unoccupied building, and here it was determined they should pass\r\nthe night. The villagers of Sylvania knew little of the sad realities of\r\nwar, having hitherto happily escaped the visits of the armed hosts. They\r\nsurrounded the men of the escort, and plied them with many curious\r\nquestions, which were good-naturedly answered with as much, or as little\r\nexaggeration as good soldiers usually indulge in when confronted with\r\ngreenhorns. Their attention, thus agreeably occupied by the\r\nsimple-minded villagers, was in some degree removed from their charge,\r\nand this little circumstance seemed propitious to Glazier, who was\r\nwatching intently his opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe sergeant had notified the prisoners that his foragers had returned\r\nwith a quantity of sweet potatoes and some corn-bread; that the former\r\nwould be issued to the \"Yanks,\" and the latter to the guard. Orders\r\nalso were given to place all the food at one end of the porch, where a\r\nfire had been kindled of rail fence; and the potatoes were to be served\r\nto the prisoners from that point.\r\n\r\nGlazier, under the pretence of desiring to use the fire for the purpose\r\nof roasting the potatoes, obtained leave for all to remain outside on\r\nthe porch until after supper. This concession reluctantly granted, hope\r\nsprang in his breast that the opportunity he so ardently sought was now\r\nat hand. Quickly he determined upon his plan of operation, and seeing\r\nLieutenant John W. Wright, of the Tenth Iowa Volunteers, near him,\r\nwhispered in his ear an outline of his desperate project, and invited\r\nthe latter to join in putting it into execution. To this proposition,\r\nwithout a moment's consideration, Wright consented.\r\n\r\nThe two candidates for freedom then sauntered towards the end of the\r\nporch, conversing loudly and cheerfully upon general topics, and thus\r\nexcited no suspicion of their intentions. The hungry prisoners gathered\r\naround the ration-board, when Glazier covertly signaled his companion,\r\nand each suddenly clutched a good handful of the corn-bread. Under cover\r\nof the increasing darkness, and screened from observation by the men who\r\nstood between them and the guard, they quietly but rapidly, in a\r\nstooping position, stole away, making for the edge of a neighboring\r\nwood. Not a word was spoken, and in less time than it takes to record\r\nit, they were concealed among the foliage and undergrowth; and,\r\nbefriended by the darkness, were completely masked from the observation\r\nof the enemy.\r\n\r\nFortunately their flight was unobserved until after the distribution of\r\nthe rations, when the guard missed their corn-bread. This seemed to be\r\nfelt more than the loss of their prisoners, the sergeant exclaiming, in\r\neuphemistic southern (according to Glazier), \"By dog on't! the d----d\r\nYankee officers have done gone and took all our corn-bread. I'll have\r\nthem, if it costs me a horse!\"\r\n\r\nCalling out a corporal and four men, he quickly ordered them to go to\r\nthe nearest plantation for hounds, and to \"bring back the two Yanks dead\r\nor alive,\" adding that he \"guessed they had taken the Springfield road,\"\r\nwhich was the nearest route to the Federal lines.\r\n\r\nIt happened, however, that the peremptory orders of the sergeant were\r\noverheard by Glazier and Wright, who were hidden not many yards away in\r\nthe wood. Instead, therefore, of proceeding on the direct road by way of\r\nSpringfield, they retraced their steps in the dark, and by this means\r\nbaffled their pursuers. Having reached the Middle Ground Road, over\r\nwhich they had lately passed, they bounded over it to avoid leaving\r\ntheir foot-prints, and thus broke the trail. They were now in a large\r\nand densely-wooded swamp, and, effectually concealed by the umbrageous\r\ncovering, sat down to a council of war.\r\n\r\nWe may here state that Lieutenant Lemon, the late faithful companion of\r\nour hero, had been prevented from participating in the plan of escape,\r\nand was eventually taken back to be re-tortured in his old quarters at\r\nColumbia. Wright was also an escaped prisoner from Columbia, whom\r\nGlazier had often met during his imprisonment there. He escaped from\r\n\"Camp Sorghum\" a few days after Lemon and Glazier, but unfortunately was\r\nrecaptured just when he felt that he was about to bid adieu to his\r\ncaptivity.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Wright possessed one advantage for the dangerous and\r\ndesperate enterprise they had now re-entered upon--he knew the country.\r\nBy his advice, therefore, it was agreed to remain quietly concealed in\r\nthe swamp until night, when he would lead the way to the hut of a negro\r\nwho had befriended him during his previous attempt to escape.\r\n\r\nAbout midnight he piloted Glazier to the hut of \"Old Richard,\" a worthy\r\nand kind-hearted negro, who had supplied him with hoe-cake and bacon\r\njust before his recapture. Richard was in ecstasies on beholding his\r\nfriend, Massa Wright, again, whom he knew to have been retaken, and with\r\ndue formality, our hero was introduced. On being asked for some bacon\r\nand sweet potatoes to put with their corn-bread, he replied: \"Pooty hard\r\ncase, massa; but dis yer darkey'll do de best he can. Can't get nuffin'\r\non this plantation, but reckon I can buy some 'tatoes down at Massa\r\nSmith's, three miles from yer, and will go down thar after I finish my\r\ntask to-morrer. As to meat,\" he said, \"you know, massa, dat in the Souf\r\nde slave takes what de white folks frows away, and I reckon you all\r\ncouldn't eat a tainted ham dat ole massa gib me t'other day; but if you\r\ncan, God knows dis chile gibs it to you wid all his heart.\" Having\r\nbecome, from long fasting, almost entirely indifferent to the sense of\r\ntaste, our friends gave Old Richard to understand that the ham would be\r\nwelcome.\r\n\r\nThe important question of rations having been thus satisfactorily\r\narranged, Richard was asked to guide the fugitives to some place of\r\nhiding, where no rebel could find them. Accordingly, they were conducted\r\nto a swamp, and soon discovered a secure place of concealment for the\r\nday. \"The whippoorwill and turtle-dove,\" Captain Glazier writes,\r\n\"enlivened the hours with their inspiring notes, and as night began to\r\napproach, the gloomy owl, from the tree-tops, uttered his solemn warning\r\ncry. The pine and cypress, swayed by the breeze, moaned a perpetual\r\nchorus, and under their teaching we learned, during the long, dreary\r\nhours, how much we were indebted to these dismal wilds, that concealed\r\nboth friend and foe.\r\n\r\n\"Here the rebel deserter concealed himself from his pursuers. Here the\r\nloyalist found a hiding-place from the rebel conscripting officer. Here\r\nthe trembling negro had his first taste of freedom. Here the escaped\r\nUnion prisoner was enabled to baffle blood-hounds and human-hounds, and\r\nmake his way to the Federal lines.\"\r\n\r\nThe day wore away at length, and as darkness was approaching, Old\r\nRichard, true to his promise, was on hand with the supplies. He gave the\r\nfugitives all he had been able to purchase with his small means, and\r\nthey, after asking God to bless him for his kindness, departed. Our\r\nfriends trudged away, rejoicing, notwithstanding their fatigue, and the\r\nbodily weakness of Glazier. For the latter had by this time been reduced\r\nin weight to not more than ninety pounds, his usual weight having been\r\nabout one hundred and forty-five. He was still, however, filled with\r\nindomitable \"pluck,\" and a determination to conquer the situation, with\r\nall its dread horrors, and return to his colors. Wright, on the other\r\nhand, had a splendid physique, and cared little for hardships that would\r\nhave intimidated, or perhaps killed, an ordinary man. On several\r\noccasions he picked Glazier up and generously bore him upon his broad\r\nshoulders over the worst parts of the swamp, the latter being too weak\r\nto make his way alone without falling into the slough-holes.\r\n\r\nThey were startled, in the course of this night, on seeing two men, who,\r\nby their conversation, which was overheard, proved to be rebel deserters\r\nfrom Wheeler's command. Our friends deemed it the wisest plan to secrete\r\nthemselves behind a log until the men had passed.\r\n\r\nAt break of day they again concealed themselves, and rested between the\r\nroots of an ancient cypress. Their ears were now greeted with the\r\ndistant boom of heavy cannon, which came from the direction of Savannah.\r\nThis helped in directing their course for the following night, and also\r\nannounced to them in plain language that they were not very far from the\r\nfriends they longed to meet.\r\n\r\nRefreshed and hopeful they started as the shades of evening fell,\r\ndetermined, if possible, to accomplish a good march before daylight.\r\n\r\nThey had not, however, proceeded far, when a large plantation became\r\nvisible, the white mansion gleaming through the trees. Wright\r\nrecognizing the place, suggested that Glazier might procure a good\r\nsupper, and something for the haversack, if he would boldly call and\r\npersonate a rebel officer, trusting to his face and ready wit to carry\r\nhim through. He had heard from some negroes that the only occupant was a\r\nMrs. Keyton and some young children, the wife and family of the planter,\r\nwho was an officer in the rebel army; and further that there were no\r\nhounds about the place.\r\n\r\nGlazier, with characteristic promptness, acquiesced; and the following\r\nis a description of the interview, extracted from the diary, which amid\r\nall his wanderings and trials he never failed to keep regularly written\r\nup:\r\n\r\n\"After hearing Wright's description, and having agreed upon signals of\r\ndanger, should any occur, I started on my foraging expedition, with a\r\ngood degree of assurance.\r\n\r\n\"Stepping up to the door of the mansion, I rapped, and the lady soon\r\nmade her appearance. She seemed both refined and intelligent. I asked,\r\n'Can you give this rebel a supper?' She replied, 'You shall have the\r\nbest the house affords,' and invited me to step in and take a seat by\r\nthe fire. I did so, saying, as I took my seat, 'Madam, I am shocked at\r\nthe dastardly conduct of General Sherman in his march through Georgia.\r\nIt has been characterized by nothing but what should excite revenge, and\r\nmove to action, every man possessing a true Southern spirit. Our aged\r\ncitizens, who have banded together for mutual protection, have been\r\ntreated as bushwackers--have been driven from their homes, and their\r\nproperty confiscated. Our hounds, always true to the interests of the\r\nSouth, have been shot down by the road-side for no other reason than\r\nthat they were used in tracking escaped prisoners--'\r\n\r\n\"Interrupting me here, the lady remarked, much to my surprise, that she\r\ncould not see that the Yankees were much worse than the Confederates,\r\nafter all. She added: \"'When the Yankee army passed through this State,\r\nthey took from the rich the supplies necessary for their sustenance; and\r\nwhen our cavalry followed they took nearly all that was left, seeming to\r\ncare but little for our wants, and often depriving defenceless women\r\nand children of their last morsel of bread.'\r\n\r\n\"'I regret, madam, that the conduct of our troops has been such as to\r\ngive you reason for complaint.'\r\n\r\n\"'I, too, regret that our men have not proved themselves worthy of a\r\ncause which they appear so willing to defend.'\r\n\r\n\"'Remember,' I continued, 'that our commissary department has been\r\ncompletely wrecked, and that we are entirely dependent upon the people\r\nfor the subsistence of a large army.'\r\n\r\n\"By the sad expression of her countenance, which accompanied and\r\nfollowed this remark, I saw clearly that she felt we had reached a\r\ncrisis in the war, when Providence was turning the tables, and she\r\naccordingly interrogated:\r\n\r\n\"'And what do you think of present prospects?'\r\n\r\n\"I quickly responded, 'Our future looks dark--our cause appears almost\r\nhopeless, but the sacrifices of our gallant dead remain unavenged.\r\nTherefore, we must fight while there is a man left, and die in the last\r\nditch.'\r\n\r\n\"'If there be no longer any hope of success, sir, I should say that it\r\nwould be better to lay down our arms at once, and go back under the old\r\nflag.'\r\n\r\n\"'Madam, we must fight, we _must fight_!'\r\n\r\n\"'But it is wickedness and worse than madness to continue this awful\r\nmassacre of human beings, without some prospect of ultimate success.'\r\n\r\n\"'Very true; but we have lost all in this struggle, and must sell our\r\nlives as dearly as possible.'\r\n\r\n\"By this time the good lady seemed to have waxed enthusiastic, and\r\nwarm as the fire over which the servant was preparing my supper, and she\r\nanswered:\r\n\r\n\"'My husband is a captain in the Twenty-fifth Georgia Infantry. He is\r\nthe father of these children, and is very dear to both them and me. Long\r\nhave I prayed that he might be spared to return to his family, but fear\r\nthat we shall never be permitted to see him again. When he entered the\r\narmy, I admired his patriotism, and was glad to see him go in defence of\r\nwhat I supposed to be the true interests of the southern people; but _we\r\nhave been deceived from the beginning by our military and political\r\nleaders_. It is time to open our eyes, and see what obstinacy has\r\nbrought us. We are conquered. Let us return to the rule of the Federal\r\ngovernment, ere we are ruined.'\r\n\r\n\"Madam, your sympathies appear to be largely with the Yankees.'\r\n\r\n\"'It is not strange, sir; I was born and educated in New England;--and\r\nyour speech would indicate that you too are not a native of the South.'\r\n\r\n\"'You are right; I am a New Yorker by birth, but have been for a\r\nconsiderable time in South Carolina.'\r\n\r\n\"After partaking of the frugal meal set before me, which consisted of\r\ncorn-bread and sweet potatoes, I thanked the lady for her kindness, and\r\ntold her that I regretted very deeply that I was not in a situation to\r\nremunerate her for so much trouble. Noticing my blue pants as I arose\r\nfrom the table, she remarked:\r\n\r\n\"'It is impossible for me to know our men from the Yankees by the\r\nuniform; but a few days since, two soldiers asked me to get them some\r\nsupper, claiming to be scouts to General Wheeler; they told many very\r\nplausible stories, and the next day, to my astonishment, I was charged\r\nwith harboring Yankee spies.'\r\n\r\n\"'I do not wonder that you find it difficult to distinguish the Yankee\r\nfrom the Confederate soldier, for in these trying times a poor rebel is\r\ncompelled to wear anything he can get. The dead are always stripped, and\r\nat this season of the year, we find the Federal uniform far more\r\ncomfortable than our own.'\r\n\r\n\"'It must be an awful extremity that could tempt men to strip the dying\r\nand the dead!'\r\n\r\n\"'We have become so much accustomed to such practices, that we are\r\nunmoved by scenes which might appall and sicken those who have never\r\nserved in our ranks.'\r\n\r\n\"'I sincerely hope that these murderous practices will soon be at an\r\nend.'\r\n\r\n\"Feeling that I had been absent from my comrade long enough, and that it\r\nwas time to make my departure, I arose, saying,\r\n\r\n\"'I must go, madam; may I know to whom I am so much indebted for my\r\nsupper and kind entertainment this evening?'\r\n\r\n\"'Mrs. James Keyton. And what may I call your name?'\r\n\r\n\"'Willard Glazier, Fifty-third Alabama Mounted Infantry.'\r\n\r\n\"'Should you chance to meet the Twenty-fifth Georgia, please inquire for\r\nCaptain Keyton, and say to him that his wife and children are well, and\r\nsend their love.'\r\n\r\n\"'He shall certainly have your message if it is my good fortune to meet\r\nhim. Good-night.'\"\r\n\r\nLeaving Mrs. Keyton with her fears for the rebel cause in general, and\r\nher husband in particular, Glazier hurried out to find his friend Wright\r\npacing up and down the road in a bad humor at having been kept so long\r\nwaiting; but setting their faces in the direction of Springfield, they\r\nat once started on their march. They soon found themselves approaching\r\nthe rebel forces in General Sherman's rear, and determined at all risks\r\nto obtain information of the two armies. They were at General Iverson's\r\nheadquarters, and at one time were within fifteen paces of the house he\r\noccupied.\r\n\r\nCautiously concealing themselves behind trees they reached a spot within\r\nearshot of the provost-guard, and overheard their conversation. The\r\nprospects of the war were freely discussed, and the fall of Savannah.\r\nThe conclusion forced on the minds of our friends was that the\r\nConfederate cause was losing ground, and its armies would soon be\r\ncompelled to surrender to the Union force.\r\n\r\nGlazier and his comrade left the spot inspired with renewed courage.\r\n\r\nSix miles on their road to Springfield found daylight approaching, and\r\nthe fugitives hurriedly secreted themselves among some tall swamp grass.\r\nThey were suddenly aroused by the baying of a blood-hound, and\r\nimmediately sprang to their feet.\r\n\r\n\"We are followed!\" exclaimed Wright.\r\n\r\n\"What do you propose to do?\" quickly asked Glazier.\r\n\r\n\"I am undecided,\" was the unsatisfactory reply.\r\n\r\n\"It is my opinion,\" said Glazier, promptly, \"that if we are not off at\r\nonce we shall be prisoners.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, off it is!\" spoke Wright; and both struck off in a southeasterly\r\ndirection in double quick time. Fences and ditches were leaped, and\r\nstreams forded, the hounds approaching so nearly that their baying could\r\nbe distinctly heard by the fugitives; but fortunately, or\r\nprovidentially, they came to a large creek, and jumping in, waded along\r\nits course for a distance of some sixty rods, then emerging, pursued\r\ntheir journey in the direction they had intended. About one o'clock they\r\nconcluded they had out-generaled the bushwhackers and their hounds.\r\nElated by success they became less cautious and did not halt. About two\r\no'clock Glazier was startled by seeing his companion drop suddenly and\r\nsilently behind a tree. Glazier followed, watching the movements of\r\nWright, and presently saw that they were within a few rods of a\r\nConfederate picket. Before they had time to move a cavalry patrol came\r\nup to the post with instructions, and, as soon as he had passed, our\r\nfriends crawled upon their hands and knees into the friendly swamp, and\r\nthus screened themselves from their enemy.\r\n\r\nThe _hounds_, however, were a source of greater danger to the fugitives\r\nthan the rebel pickets; the training and scent of the former having been\r\nso perfected and developed by long and cruel use in the recapture of\r\nfugitive slaves, that, to evade them, was almost an impossibility. Hence\r\nthe sense of caution was strained to the utmost both by night and day on\r\nthe part of our friends.\r\n\r\nThe use of blood-hounds in warfare is considered _barbarous_ in every\r\ncountry pretending to civilization, even if they are employed against a\r\nforeign foe. How much more so, in a war waged between fellow-citizens of\r\none blood, one history, one language, and in numerous instances, bearing\r\ndomestic or family relations to each other; and this, in support of a\r\ncause, the righteousness of which was doubted by many who found\r\nthemselves unwillingly compelled to give in their adherence at the\r\ndictation of a few ambitious men. For this sin a righteous God has\r\njudged them! A cause thus supported deserved defeat in the estimation of\r\njust men of every nation, apart from all political considerations.\r\n\r\nCaptain Glazier and his friend congratulated themselves on having so far\r\neluded, by every expedient known to them, the sanguinary fangs of these\r\nbarbarous instruments of warfare; and after nightfall continued their\r\nroute, passing the picket in the darkness.\r\n\r\nSoon after they encountered a colored friend, known among his people as\r\n\"Uncle Philip.\" This good darkey informed them that the Federal forces\r\nhad possession of Cherokee Hill, on the Savannah River Road, only eight\r\nmiles distant--news which afforded them inexpressible joy! Uncle Philip\r\nwas asked if he would guide them to the lines; and replied: \"I'ze neber\r\nben down dar, massa, sense Massa Sherman's company went to Savannah; but\r\nI reckon you-uns can git Massa Jones, a free cullered man, to take you\r\nober. He's a mighty bright pusson, and understands de swamps jest like a\r\nbook.\"\r\n\r\nOn reaching Jones' hut his wife informed them that her husband was out\r\nscouting, but was expected back about eleven o'clock. She urged our\r\nfriends to enter and await his return, as he was always glad to do all\r\nin his power for the Yankees. Fearing the rebel scouts might discover\r\nthem, they, at first, hesitated, but consented on Mrs. Jones promising\r\nto be on the alert. She accordingly volunteered her two boys, one of\r\neight years and the other six, for out-post duty, charging them strictly\r\nto notify her immediately if they saw any one approaching, so that she\r\nmight conceal the fugitives. Auntie then promptly placed before them a\r\nbountiful supply of hoe-cake and parched corn, the best her humble cot\r\nafforded, and most welcome to the famished men.\r\n\r\nJones returned at the appointed hour, but informed his guests that,\r\nwhile very willing to guide them, he was not sufficiently acquainted\r\nwith the safest route to do so; and referred them to a friend of his,\r\nwho would accompany them, and whom he could strongly recommend as a\r\ncompetent and safe guide. On visiting this man he also pleaded ignorance\r\nof any _safe_ route; but mentioned the name of still another \"friend of\r\nthe Yankees,\" who, he said, had come up from the Union lines that\r\nmorning and would willingly return with them. This friendly negro also\r\nwas found. He was a genuine negro, as black as ebony and very devout in\r\nhis mode of speech. His name was \"March Dasher.\" \"I'll do it, massa, if\r\nGod be my helper!\" he answered to their eager inquiry.\r\n\r\nGlazier and his comrade were impatient to start at once, but upon this\r\npoint Dasher was inexorable. \"Dis chile knows whar de pickets is in de\r\nday-time,\" he emphatically declared, \"but knows nuffin 'bout 'em arter\r\ndark;\" and absolutely declined to take the risk of falling within the\r\nConfederate lines--an act of prudence and firmness for which he was to\r\nbe much commended.\r\n\r\nA fear of treachery was aroused when Dasher tried to induce them to\r\nremain in his hut till morning, but this was immediately and entirely\r\nremoved when he and his household at a signal, fell on their knees, and\r\njoined in simple but fervent prayer to the Almighty, as a friend of the\r\nfriendless--beseeching Him to protect and prosper them in their\r\nefforts to flee from their enemies; and much more of a nature to disarm\r\nany suspicion of their fidelity and good-will to the Union cause.\r\n\r\nOur friends, however, declined to remain in the hut, fearing a surprise\r\nfrom the outpost; and at the conclusion of the prayer, betook themselves\r\nto a pine thicket with the joint resolution of giving their dark friend\r\nno peace until he started with them to the Federal lines.\r\n\r\nAbout one o'clock in the morning, Wright, impatient of delay, proceeded\r\nto the hut, and arousing Dasher, told him that day had just begun to\r\nbreak. He came to the door, and pointing to the stars in the unclouded\r\nsky, remarked, with a good-tempered smile, \"I reck'n it's good many\r\nhours yet till break ob day, massa. Yer can't fool March on de time; his\r\nclock neber breaks down. It's jest right ebery time.\" Wright returned to\r\nhis lair in the thicket, remarking irritably, as he threw himself down,\r\n\"Glazier, you might as well undertake to move a mountain, as to get the\r\nstart of that colored individual!\"\r\n\r\nAt the first peep of dawn, punctual to his promise, Dasher thrust his\r\nblack, good-humored face into the thicket, and announced:\r\n\r\n\"Now I'ze ready, gemmen, to take you right plum into Mr. Sherman's\r\ncompany by 'sun-up;'\" and as Sol began to gild the tree-tops and the\r\ndistant eastern hills, the trio came within sight of the Federal camp,\r\nand witnessed the \"Stars and Stripes,\" floating triumphantly in the\r\nbreeze!\r\n\r\nWhat pen can describe their emotions, when--after more than fourteen\r\nlong months' suffering from imprisonment, starvation, nakedness, bodily\r\nand mental prostration, and every inhumanity short of being murdered,\r\nlike many of their imprisoned comrades, in cold blood--they again hailed\r\n_friends_ and found _freedom_ at last within their grasp! Words would\r\nfail to tell their joy. Let us leave it to the reader to imagine.\r\n\r\nOn first approaching the camp they were supposed, by their motley\r\nattire, to be deserters from the enemy; and, as true soldiers and\r\ndeserters never fraternize, no signal of welcome was offered by the\r\n\"boys in blue.\" The suspicions of the latter, however, were allayed on\r\nseeing Glazier and his companion wave their caps: then they were\r\nbeckoned to come forward. And when it was discovered that they were\r\n_escaped prisoners_, an enthusiastic grip was given to each by every\r\nsoldier present, accompanied by cordial congratulations on their\r\nsuccessful escape from the barbarous enemy who had had them in custody.\r\n\r\n\"Each man,\" writes Glazier, \"took us by the hand, congratulating us on\r\nour eventful and successful escape, while we cheered the boys for the\r\nglorious work they had accomplished for the Union. Haversacks were\r\nopened and placed at our disposal. There was a great demand for\r\nhard-tack and coffee; but the beauty of it all was, Major Turner was not\r\nthere, to say what he often repeated, 'Reduce their rations; I'll teach\r\nthe d----d scoundrels not to attempt to escape!'\r\n\r\n\"I cannot forget,\" he adds, \"the sea of emotion that well-nigh\r\noverwhelmed me, as soon as I could realize the fact that I was no longer\r\na prisoner, and especially when I beheld the starry banner floating\r\ntriumphantly over the invincibles who had followed their great General\r\ndown to the sea.\"\r\n\r\nOur hero and his friend became objects of much curiosity, while their\r\neventful escape was the subject of general conversation and comment by\r\nthe brave boys who pressed around them, and who proved to be a\r\ndetachment of the One Hundred and First Illinois Volunteers, Twentieth\r\nArmy Corps. Their most intimate friends would have failed to recognize\r\nthem. Glazier was clad in an old gray jacket and blue pants, with a\r\nvenerable and dilapidated hat which had seen a prodigious amount of\r\nservice of a nondescript kind; while a tattered gray blanket that had\r\ndone duty for many a month as a bed by day and a cloak by night, and was\r\nnow in the last stage of dissolution from age and general infirmity,\r\ncompleted his unmilitary and unpretentious toilet. Having at first no\r\none to identify them, Glazier and his companion were as strangers among\r\nfriends, and necessarily without official recognition. At length,\r\nhowever, after much searching, they found Lieutenant Wright's old\r\ncompany, and thus the refugees became officially identified and\r\nrecognized as Federal officers.\r\n\r\nIn company with Lieutenant E. H. Fales, who had been his fellow-prisoner\r\nat Charleston, and effected his escape, Glazier proceeded on horseback\r\nto the headquarters of General Kilpatrick. The General, cordially\r\nwelcoming and congratulating Glazier on his happy escape, at once\r\nfurnished him with the documents necessary to secure his transportation\r\nto the North. His term of service having expired, he was anxious to\r\nrevisit his family, who thought him dead, and bidding an affectionate\r\nadieu to his friend Wright, he and Lieutenant Fales embarked on a\r\nsteamship on December twenty-ninth for home. After experiencing the\r\neffects of a severe storm at sea, the vessel arrived at the wharf of\r\nthe metropolitan city, and our hero adds: \"I awoke to the glorious\r\nrealization that I was again breathing the air of my native State. There\r\nwas exhilaration and rapture in the thought, which I could not repress,\r\nand that moment is fixed as a golden era in my memory. I hope never to\r\nbecome so hardened that that patriotic and Christian exultation will be\r\nan unpleasant recollection.\"\r\n\r\nThere have probably been few hearts that beat higher with martial ardor,\r\nthan that of Willard Glazier; but at that moment the thought of\r\n\"Battle's red carnival\" was merged in the gentler recollection of\r\nkindred and friends, rest and home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nGLAZIER RE-ENTERS THE SERVICE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Glazier's determination to re-enter the army.--Letter to Colonel\r\n    Harhaus.--Testimonial from Colonel Clarence Buel.--Letter from\r\n    Hon. Martin I.

He had registered a vow to remain in the army until\r\nrelieved by death, or the termination of the war. His heart and soul\r\nwere in the Union cause, and finding that at the expiration of his term\r\nof service he had been mustered out, he had determined before proceeding\r\nto his home to apply for another commission, and, if possible, resume\r\nhis place at the front.\r\n\r\nThe following letter, which we think stamps his earnest loyalty to the\r\ncause he had espoused, and for which he had already suffered so much,\r\nwas addressed to his friend and patron:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                Astor House, New York,\r\n                                               _January 10th, 1865_.\r\n\r\n     Colonel Otto Harhaus,\r\n        Late of the Harris Light Cavalry:\r\n\r\n     Dear Colonel: Having reached our lines, an escaped prisoner, on the\r\n     twenty-third of last month, I at once took steps to ascertain my\r\n     position in the old regiment, and regret to say, was informed at\r\n     the war department that as my term of service had expired during my\r\n     imprisonment; and, as I had not remustered previous to capture, I\r\n     was now regarded supernumerary. I wish to remain in the service\r\n     until the close of the war, and so expressed myself before I fell\r\n     into the hands of the enemy. Fourteen months in rebel prisons has\r\n     not increased my respect for \"Southern chivalry\"--in short I have\r\n     some old scores to settle.\r\n\r\n     I write, Colonel, to ascertain if you will be kind enough to advise\r\n     me what steps I had better take to secure a new commission in the\r\n     Cavalry Corps, and to ask if you will favor me with a letter of\r\n     recommendation to Governor Fenton. It was suggested to me at\r\n     Washington that I should place my case before him, and, if I\r\n     conclude to do so, a note from you will be of great value.\r\n\r\n     I learn through Captain Downing that I was commissioned a first\r\n     lieutenant upon your recommendation soon after my capture. If so, I\r\n     avail myself of this opportunity to acknowledge my deep sense of\r\n     the favor, and to thank you very cordially for remembering me at a\r\n     time when I was entirely dependent upon your impartial decisions\r\n     for advancement in your command.\r\n\r\n     I made my escape from the rebel prison at Columbia, South Carolina,\r\n     November twenty-sixth, 1864, was recaptured December fifteenth by a\r\n     Confederate outpost near Springfield, Georgia; escaped a second\r\n     time the following day and was retaken by a detachment of Texan\r\n     cavalry under General Wheeler; was tried as a spy at Springfield;\r\n     escaped a third time from Sylvania on the nineteenth of December,\r\n     and reached the Federal lines near Savannah, four days later, and\r\n     twenty-eight days after my escape from Columbia. I was at General\r\n     Kilpatrick's headquarters on the Ogeechee, December twenty-sixth.\r\n     The general was in the most exuberant spirits, and entertained me\r\n     with stories of the Great March from Atlanta to the sea. He desired\r\n     to be remembered to all the officers and men of his old cavalry\r\n     division in Virginia.\r\n\r\n     I expect to be mustered out of service to-day, and if so, shall\r\n     start this evening for my home in Northern New York, which I have\r\n     not visited since entering the army three years ago.\r\n\r\n     Soliciting a response at your earliest convenience,\r\n\r\n                   I have the honor to remain, Colonel,\r\n\r\n                           Very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n                                                      Willard Glazier.\r\n\r\n\r\nImpatient of delay in the gratification of his ardent and patriotic\r\ndesire to rejoin the army, Glazier also addressed an earnest letter to\r\nHon. M. I. Townsend, of his native State, accompanying it with the\r\nfollowing glowing testimonial from his late superior officer and\r\ncompanion in arms, Colonel Clarence Buel:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                            Saratoga Springs, New York,\r\n                                              _February 14th, 1865._\r\n\r\n     Hon. Martin I. Townsend:\r\n\r\n     Dear Sir: It is with great pleasure that I introduce to your\r\n     acquaintance my friend Lieutenant Willard Glazier. He entered the\r\n     service as a private in my company in the \"Harris Light Cavalry,\"\r\n     and was promoted for services in the field to his present rank. I\r\n     considered him one of the very best and most promising young\r\n     officers whom I knew, and his career has only strengthened my\r\n     opinion of his merits. After a period of long and gallant service\r\n     in the field he had the misfortune to be taken prisoner in a\r\n     desperate cavalry fight, and has but recently returned home after\r\n     escaping from a terrible confinement of more than a year in the\r\n     prison pens at Richmond, Danville, Macon, Savannah, Charleston, and\r\n     Columbia. I wish you would take time to hear the modest recital\r\n     which he makes of his experience in Southern prisons, and of his\r\n     escape; and I feel sure you will agree with me, that he is worthy\r\n     of any interest you may take in him.\r\n\r\n     He is desirous of re-entering the service as soon as he can procure\r\n     a commission in any way equal to his deserts; and I told him that I\r\n     knew of no one who could give him more valuable aid than yourself\r\n     in his patriotic purpose. I do most cordially commend him to your\r\n     consideration, and shall esteem anything you may do for him as a\r\n     great personal favor. With very sincere regards,\r\n\r\n                              I am, your obedient friend and servant,\r\n                                                         Clarence Buel.\r\n\r\n\r\nHon. Martin I. Townsend, on receipt of Colonel Buel's flattering\r\nintroduction, at once interested himself in Glazier's behalf; and after\r\nfully investigating his military record handed him the following to the\r\nGovernor of New York State:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       Troy, New York,\r\n                                                _February 15th, 1865._\r\n\r\n     His Excellency R. E. Fenton, Governor of New York:\r\n\r\n     Dear Sir: Willard Glazier, late of the \"Harris Light Cavalry,\" who\r\n     served with honor as a lieutenant in that regiment, is a most\r\n     excellent young patriot, and has many well-wishers in our city. He\r\n     desires to enter the service again. I take the liberty to solicit\r\n     for him a commission. No appointment would be more popular here,\r\n     and I undertake to say, without hesitation, that I know of no more\r\n     deserving young officer. His heart was always warm in the service,\r\n     and he now has fifteen months of most barbarous cruelty, practised\r\n     on him while a prisoner, to avenge.\r\n\r\n                                            Very respectfully yours,\r\n                                                   Martin I. Townsend.\r\n\r\n\r\nHis former commanders, Generals H. E. Davies and Judson Kilpatrick, also\r\nbore their willing testimony to the qualifications and merits of our\r\nyoung subaltern in the following handsome manner:\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Headquarters, First Brigade, Cavalry Division,\r\n                           Near Culpepper, Va.,\r\n\r\n                                               _February 16th, 1865._\r\n\r\n     To His Excellency Hon. R. E. Fenton:\r\n\r\n     Lieutenant Willard Glazier, formerly of the Second New York\r\n     Cavalry, served in the regiment under my immediate command, for\r\n     more than two years, until his capture by the enemy.\r\n\r\n     He joined the regiment as an enlisted man, and served in that\r\n     capacity with courage and ability, and for good conduct was\r\n     recommended for and received a commission as second lieutenant. As\r\n     an officer he did his duty well, and on several occasions behaved\r\n     with great gallantry, and with good judgment. Owing to a long\r\n     imprisonment, I learn he has been rendered supernumerary in his\r\n     regiment, and mustered out of service. I can recommend him highly\r\n     as an officer, and as well worthy to receive a commission.\r\n\r\n                                              Very respectfully,\r\n                                                 H. E. Davies, Jr.,\r\n                                   Brigadier-General U. S. Volunteers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Headquarters Cavalry Command, M. D. M.,\r\n                         Near Savannah, Georgia, _December 27th, 1864_.\r\n\r\n     Lieutenant Willard Glazier, Harris Light Cavalry:\r\n\r\n     Lieutenant: I take great pleasure in expressing to you my high\r\n     appreciation of your many soldierly qualities. I well remember the\r\n     fact that you were once a private in the old regiment I had the\r\n     honor to command; and that by attention to duty and good conduct\r\n     _alone_, you received promotion. You have my best wishes for your\r\n     future advancement, and may command my influence at all times.\r\n\r\n                                  Very respectfully and truly yours,\r\n                                                    Judson Kilpatrick,\r\n                                   Brigadier-General, U. S. Volunteers.\r\n\r\n\r\nHis application was crowned with success, and upon the twenty-fifth of\r\nFebruary, 1865, he received his commission as First Lieutenant in the\r\nTwenty-sixth Regiment, New York Cavalry.\r\n\r\nNot until this important matter was satisfactorily arranged would our\r\nyoung lieutenant turn his face towards home. He had been absent about\r\nthree years, and a report had reached his family that he had died in\r\nprison at Columbia.\r\n\r\nWith his commission in his pocket, he now allowed thoughts of home to\r\noccupy his mind, and proceeded thither without the loss of a moment. On\r\nreaching the homestead which had been the scene of his birth, and of the\r\nadventures of his boyhood, he knocked and entered, and his mother met\r\nhim at the threshold. Three years between the ages of sixteen and\r\nnineteen, especially after vicissitudes and sufferings such as he had\r\nendured, effect changes in the features and height and general\r\nappearance, much more pronounced than a similar interval would produce\r\nat a later or an earlier period of life. The mother did not recognize\r\nher son; and seeing this, he did not announce himself, but inquired if\r\nany news had recently been received of her son Willard, who, he said,\r\nwas in the same regiment as himself. She answered that her son was\r\n_dead_--she had seen his name in the death-record of the prison of\r\nColumbia, and asked earnestly concerning him. By this time his sister\r\nMarjorie, with three years added to her stature, but still in her teens,\r\nentered the room, and, looking fixedly at the stranger's solemn\r\ncountenance, exclaimed, with a thrilling outcry: \"Why, that's Will!\" The\r\nspell was broken, and mother and son, sister and brother, amid smiles\r\nand sobs, embraced, and the young soldier, \"who was dead and is alive,\"\r\nwas welcomed to the fond hearts of those who had grieved over his loss.\r\n\r\nFilial and fraternal love was a trait in Glazier's character which\r\nclaims a few words. A dutiful son and an affectionate brother, he had\r\nnever neglected an opportunity of assisting and furthering the interests\r\nof his family. Before entering the army he had contributed of his scant\r\nearnings as a teacher towards the education of his three sisters, and\r\nduring his service in the war had, from time to time, as he received his\r\npay, made remittances home for the same unselfish purpose. On being\r\nmustered out of the army, the government had paid him the sum of $500,\r\nand this sum he now generously handed over to his parents to be also\r\nexpended in perfecting the education of his sisters.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Glazier now hastened to report himself to the commanding\r\nofficer of his regiment, and displayed all his wonted energy and\r\ndevotion to the cause of the Union. He served faithfully and honorably\r\nuntil the mighty hosts of the Federal army melted back into quiet\r\ncitizenship, with nothing to distinguish them from other citizens but\r\ntheir scars and the proud consciousness of having SERVED AND SAVED\r\nTHEIR COUNTRY.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis brief history of the military career of a remarkable man would not\r\nbe complete without some account of his life subsequent to the\r\ndissolution of the great army of volunteers. Willard Glazier's conduct\r\nas a soldier formed an earnest of his future good citizenship--his\r\ndevotion to duty at the front, a foreshadow of his enterprise and\r\nsuccess in the business of life.\r\n\r\nHaving been honorably mustered out, he lost no time in looking about for\r\nan occupation. Joining the volunteer army when a mere youth, his\r\nopportunities of learning a profession had been very limited, and he\r\nconsequently now found himself without any permanent means of support.\r\nHis education had been necessarily interrupted by the breaking out of\r\nthe war, and his chief anxiety, now that the struggle was over, was to\r\nenter college and complete his studies.\r\n\r\nThis desire was very intense in our young citizen-soldier, and absorbed\r\nall his thoughts; but where to find the means for its accomplishment he\r\nwas at a loss to discover. In ponderings upon this subject from day to\r\nday, an idea suddenly occurred to him, which formed an epoch in his\r\nlife, and the development of which has proved it to have been the basis\r\nof a successful and useful career. The _idea_ that has borne fruit was\r\nthis: During the period of his service in the war he had kept a diary.\r\nHerein he had recorded his experiences from day to day, adding such\r\nbrief comments as the events called for, and time and opportunity\r\npermitted. This diary he always kept upon his person, and while on a\r\nlong and hurried march, or in a battle with the enemy, his _vade mecum_\r\nwould be, of necessity, occasionally neglected, no sooner did the\r\nopportunity offer than his mind wandered back over the few days'\r\ninterval since the previous entry, and each event of interest was duly\r\nchronicled. Again during the period of his confinement in Southern\r\nprisons, sick, and subjected to most inhuman treatment and privation,\r\nand while escaping from his brutal captors, concealed in the swamps\r\nduring the day, tired, hungry, and cold, his diary was never forgotten,\r\nalbeit, the entries were frequently made under the greatest\r\ndifficulties, such as to most men would have proved insurmountable.\r\n\r\nThis journal was now in his possession. He had stirred the souls of\r\nrelatives and friends by reading from it accounts of bloody scenes\r\nthrough which he had passed; of cruelties practised upon him and his\r\nbrother-patriots in Southern bastiles; of his various attempts to\r\nescape, and pursuit by blood-hounds and their barbarous masters. The\r\nstory of his war experiences entranced hundreds of eager listeners\r\naround his home, and the idea that now occurred to him, while anxiously\r\npondering the ways and means of paying his college fees, was, that his\r\nstory might possibly, by the aid of his diary, be arranged in the form\r\nof a book, and if he were fortunate enough to find a sale for it, the\r\nprofits would probably furnish the very thing he stood so much in need\r\nof.\r\n\r\nPrompt in everything, the thought no sooner occurred to the young\r\ncandidate for college honors than he proceeded to reduce it to action.\r\nHe forthwith commenced arranging the facts and dates from the diary;\r\nconstructed sentences in plain Saxon English; the work grew upon him;\r\nhe \"fought his battles o'er again;\" was again captured, imprisoned and\r\nescaped; the work continued to grow, and at the end of six weeks' hard\r\napplication, always keeping his _object_ in view, Willard Glazier, the\r\nyoung cavalryman, found himself an author--_i. e._, in manuscript.\r\n\r\nNot a little surprised and gratified to discover that he possessed the\r\ngift of putting his thoughts in a readable form, he now felt hopeful\r\nthat the day was not distant when the desire of his soul to enter\r\ncollege would be realized.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAREER AS AN AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Glazier in search of a publisher for \"Capture, Prison-Pen and\r\n    Escape.\"--Spends his last dollar.--Lieutenant Richardson a friend\r\n    in need.--Joel Munsell, of Albany, consents to publish.--The\r\n    author solicits subscriptions for his work before\r\n    publication.--Succeeds.--Captain Hampton.--R. H.\r\n    Ferguson.--Captain F. C. Lord.--Publication and sale of first\r\n    edition.--Great success.--Pays his publisher in full.--Still\r\n    greater successes.--Finally attains an enormous sale.--Style of\r\n    the work.--Extracts.--Opinions of the press.\r\n\r\nStill very young, and knowing nothing of the trade of the Publisher,\r\nGlazier found his way to the Empire City, and, manuscript in hand,\r\npresented himself before some of her leading publishers--among them, the\r\nHarpers, Appletons, Carleton, Sheldon and others.\r\n\r\nTo these gentlemen he showed his manuscript, and received courteous\r\nrecognition from each; but the terms they offered were not of a\r\ncharacter to tempt him. They would publish his book and pay him a small\r\nroyalty on their sales. His faith in his manuscript led him to expect\r\nmore substantial results. The subject of the work was one of absorbing\r\ninterest at the time, and if he had handled it properly, he knew the\r\nbook must meet with a commensurate sale. He therefore determined, if\r\npossible, to find a publisher willing to make it to his order, and leave\r\nhim to manipulate the sale himself. He was already in possession of\r\nmany unsolicited orders for it, and although knowing nothing of the\r\nsubscription-book business, determined that, when printed, his book\r\nshould be brought out by subscription.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, he was, unfortunately, like many incipient authors, without\r\ncapital, and could not therefore remain longer in New York for lack of\r\nmeans, having literally nothing left wherewith to defray even his board\r\nor procure a lodging. He was, consequently, compelled to leave if he\r\ncould obtain the means of doing so. He had arrived in New York with\r\nsanguine expectations of readily meeting with a publisher, but\r\ndiscovered, from bitter experience, as many others have done, that\r\nauthors and publishers not unfrequently view their interests from\r\ndivergent points. Courteous but cool, they offered the unknown author\r\nlittle encouragement, who, but for this, would have made the metropolis\r\nthe starting-point in his successful literary career.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture he called on Lieutenant Arthur Richardson, an old\r\ncomrade of the \"Harris Light,\" who had also been his fellow-prisoner,\r\nand was then residing in New York. To him he confided his difficulty in\r\nfinding a publisher for his book, and his extremely straitened\r\ncircumstances, at the same time stating his strong wish to return, if\r\npossible, to Albany, where he was known. Without ceremony and without\r\nconditions Richardson generously handed him twenty dollars, and, with\r\nthis godsend in hand, Glazier at once returned to Albany.\r\n\r\nArrived in the capital of his native State, he lost no time in calling\r\non the bookmen of that city, and among them, fortunately, on Mr. Joel\r\nMunsell, of 82 State street. This gentleman, well known for his\r\nlearning and probity throughout the State, and far beyond its limits,\r\ncombined the profession of an author with the more lucrative one of\r\npublisher and bookseller, and was pre-eminently in good standing as a\r\nworthy citizen and man of business.\r\n\r\nGlazier introduced himself, and once more produced his fateful\r\nmanuscript for inspection. Mr. Munsell glanced at it through his\r\nglasses, and candidly admitted the subject to be one of great interest,\r\nadding that he also thought the manuscript was carefully written, and\r\nspoke in general complimentary terms of the author and his production.\r\n\r\nGlazier, elated with this praise, at once asked to have the work\r\nstereotyped and made into a book of some four hundred pages, with ten\r\nillustrations. Mr. Munsell would be only too ready to fill the order,\r\nbut politely suggested, as a preliminary condition, an advance of two\r\nhundred dollars! Our author modestly confessed, without hesitation, that\r\nhe was not worth two hundred cents; had no means of obtaining such a\r\nsum, and could therefore advance nothing. The worthy old gentleman was\r\nstartled, and answered that such was the custom of the trade. He then\r\ninquired if Glazier had any friends who would endorse a note for the\r\namount at thirty days. The reply was that he had none; that he would\r\nexert himself to obtain a small sum from army friends, and if he\r\nsucceeded, would hand it over to him; that his only capital at present\r\nwas his conduct and character as a soldier, for testimony to which he\r\nwould refer to his late commanding officer, \"and,\" he added, \"faith in\r\nthe success of my book.\" He further offered to solicit subscriptions for\r\nthe book himself before publication, and report the result to the\r\npublisher.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Interview With Joel Munsell.]\r\n\r\nMr. Munsell, pleased with his appearance and ingenuousness, hinted at\r\nthe purchase of the manuscript, but the proposal being respectfully\r\ndeclined, inquired, if the writer undertook to sell the book himself,\r\nwould he \"stick to it.\" \"Yes!\" was the emphatic answer, \"until\r\neverything is fully paid for.\"\r\n\r\nThe reply of Munsell was equally prompt and decisive: \"I have never in\r\nall the years I have been in business published a work under such\r\ncircumstances, _but I will get that book out for you_.\" Glazier thanked\r\nthe worthy man, and expressed a hope that he would never have occasion\r\nto regret his generous deed; he would place the manuscript in his hands\r\nforthwith.\r\n\r\nHe then set out to solicit subscriptions for his work, and without\r\nprospectus, circular, or any of the usual paraphernalia of a\r\nsolicitor--with nothing but his own unsupported representations of the\r\nquality of his projected book, succeeded in obtaining a very\r\nconsiderable number of orders. These he hastened to hand over to Joel\r\nMunsell, who was now confirmed in his good opinion of the writer, and\r\nthe promising character of the venture.\r\n\r\nThus our young soldier-author was fortunate enough to find a publisher\r\nand a friend in need. A contract was drawn up, and feeling that his\r\nprospects were now somewhat assured, he ventured to write to his\r\ncomrade, and late fellow-prisoner, Captain Hampton, of Rochester, New\r\nYork, for the loan of fifty dollars. This sum was promptly sent him, and\r\nhe at once handed it over to his publisher. Mr. R. H. Ferguson, late of\r\nthe \"Harris Light,\" also generously came forward to the assistance of\r\nhis former comrade and tent-mate, and advanced him one hundred dollars\r\nto help on the work.\r\n\r\nIt may be stated here, that the friendship of Ferguson and Glazier dated\r\nfrom before the war, while the latter, a mere youth, was teaching school\r\nnear Troy, in Rensselaer County, New York: that together, on the summons\r\nto arms, they enlisted in the Harris Light Cavalry; together went to the\r\nseat of war; that both fell into the hands of the rebels and had\r\nexperience of Southern prisons; and that both effected their escape\r\nafter the endurance of much suffering. Finally, their friendship and\r\ncommon career resulted in a business connection which was attended with\r\nconsiderable success, Mr. Ferguson having become the publisher of some\r\nof Captain Glazier's subsequent writings. Captain Frederick C. Lord, of\r\nNaugatuck, Connecticut, also contributed to Glazier's need, and enabled\r\nhim by the opportune loan of twenty-five dollars to defray his board\r\nbill while waiting anxiously upon Munsell in the reading of proofs, and\r\nsoliciting subscriptions in advance.\r\n\r\nTo return to the first work of our young author, now in the hands of\r\nJoel Munsell, of Albany, which was entitled \"The Capture, Prison-Pen and\r\nEscape;\" the first edition consisted of five hundred copies, which\r\nGlazier by his energy disposed of in a few days, handing over the\r\nproceeds to the publisher. At the end of six months he had called for\r\nseveral editions of his book, and sold them all through the\r\ninstrumentality of solicitors selected by himself, some of them maimed\r\nsoldiers of the war, paid Mr. Munsell in full, and had himself three\r\nthousand dollars in hand. Success is the mother of success.\r\n\r\nHaving prospered thus far beyond his expectations, he was anxious to add\r\nto his store. Visions of large sales over other territory than his\r\nnative State of New York presented themselves to his eager mind; the\r\nbook was purchased by the public as soon as it was published; reviewers\r\nspoke in enthusiastic praise of its merits. It was not a pretentious\r\nwork--the author was simply a young man and a patriot. But passages of\r\ngreat beauty and of painful interest pervaded it, alternated with vivid\r\ndescriptions of battles in which the writer had himself shared. A\r\nveteran author need not have been ashamed of many of its glowing pages.\r\nLofty patriotism, heroic fortitude, and moral purity, characterized it\r\nthroughout.\r\n\r\nThe account given of the sufferings of our soldiers while in the\r\nprison-pens of the South, and of his own and his comrades' while\r\neffecting their escape to the Federal lines, are so vividly portrayed,\r\nthat our feelings are intensely enlisted in their behalf, and our minds\r\nwander to their dreary abodes--in thought sharing their sufferings and\r\ntheir sorrows.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by his success in this new vocation our young author\r\nresolved, for the present at least, to postpone going to college, and\r\ndevote himself to the sale of his book, by the simple agency before\r\nmentioned. This resolution cannot be considered surprising when we\r\nreflect upon the great amount of prosperity he had met with, and the\r\nprospect before him of attaining still greater advantage from a business\r\nupon which he had, by the merest accident, ventured. The college scheme\r\nwas at length finally abandoned as the business continued to increase.\r\n\"The Capture, Prison-Pen and Escape\" ultimately reached the enormous\r\nsale of over four hundred thousand copies; larger by many thousands than\r\nthat most extensively circulated and deservedly popular book, \"Uncle\r\nTom's Cabin,\" had ever attained to, inclusive of its sale in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe first book written and published by Willard Glazier is of a\r\ncharacter to surprise us, when we consider the antecedents of the writer\r\nup to the date of its publication, December, 1865. Enlisting in the\r\nranks of a cavalry regiment at the age of eighteen, during the exciting\r\nperiod of the civil war; a participant in many of its sanguinary\r\nbattles; captured by the enemy and imprisoned under circumstances of the\r\ngreatest trial and discouragement, his position and surroundings were\r\nnot a very promising school for the training of an author. The book he\r\nproduced is, in our judgment, not unworthy of comparison with the\r\nimmortal work of Defoe, with this qualification in our author's favor\r\nthat \"Robinson Crusoe\" is a fiction, while Glazier's is a true story of\r\nreal adventure undergone by the writer and his comrades of the Union\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nHis style in narrating his adventures is admirably adapted to the\r\nsubject; while the simple, unpretentious manner in which he describes\r\nthe terrible scenes he witnessed, and passed through, enlists the\r\nreader's interest in the work, and sympathy for the modest writer\r\nhimself. By the publication of this book, Glazier stamped his name upon\r\nhis country's roll of honor, and at the same time laid the foundation of\r\nhis fortune.\r\n\r\nAs a specimen of his easy flowing style we give part of the opening\r\nchapter of \"Capture, Prison-Pen and Escape:\"\r\n\r\n\"The first battle of Bull Run was fought July twenty-first, 1861, and\r\nthe shock of arms was felt throughout the land, carrying triumph to the\r\nSouth, and to the North dismay. Our proud and confident advance into\r\n'Dixie' was not only checked, but turned into a disastrous rout. The\r\npatriotic but unwarlike enthusiasm of the country, which had hoped to\r\ncrush the rebellion with seventy-five thousand men, was temporarily\r\nstifled. But the chilling was only like that of the first stealthy drops\r\nof the thunder-gust upon a raging fire, which breaks out anew and with\r\nincreased vigor when the tempest fans it with its fury, and now burns in\r\nspite of a deluge of rain. The chill had passed and the fever was\r\nraging. From the great centres of national life went forth warm currents\r\nof renovating public opinion, which reached the farthest hamlet on our\r\nfrontiers. Every true man was grasping the stirring questions of the\r\nday, and was discussing them with his family at his own fireside, and\r\nthe rebellion was just as surely doomed as when Grant received the\r\nsurrender of Lee's army. In a deeper and broader sense than before, the\r\ncountry was rising to meet the emergency, and northern patriotism, now\r\nthoroughly aroused, was sweeping everything before it. Everywhere\r\nresounded the cry, 'To arms!' and thousands upon thousands were\r\nresponding to the President's call.\r\n\r\n\"It was under these circumstances that I enlisted, as a private soldier,\r\nat Troy, New York, on the sixth day of August, in a company raised by\r\nCaptain Clarence Buel, for the Second Regiment of New York Cavalry. It\r\nis needless to make elaborate mention of the motives which induced me to\r\nenter the service, or the emotions which then filled my breast; they can\r\nbe readily conjectured by every loyal heart.\"\r\n\r\nThe Press, throughout the North (and West, as far as its circulation had\r\nreached), spoke very highly of the production and of its author, all\r\nbearing the same testimony to its excellence and truthfulness. The\r\nAlbany _Evening Post_ says:\r\n\r\n     \"'The Capture, Prison-Pen and Escape' is the title of an intensely\r\n     interesting work, giving a complete history of prison-life in the\r\n     South. The book is at once accurate, graphic and admirably written.\r\n     It is full of adventure, and quite as readable as a romance. A\r\n     person who reads this volume will have a better idea of what it\r\n     cost in the way of blood, suffering and courage, to preserve the\r\n     Republic, than he can now possibly entertain.\"\r\n\r\nThe Cleveland _Daily Leader_ writes:\r\n\r\n     \"We have had the pleasure of reading this book. It describes, in\r\n     the most graphic and interesting style, the prison-life of Union\r\n     soldiers in the South, their plans of escape, and their various\r\n     trials and hardships there. The history contained in the book is\r\n     very valuable. The Press, all over the land, speaks very highly of\r\n     it, and we can do naught but add our commendations to the rest.\"\r\n\r\nThe New York _Reformer_ exclaims:\r\n\r\n     \"From the title-page to its close, the volume is full of fresh\r\n     incidents, attracting the reader on, from page to page, with\r\n     unbroken, though at times with melancholy, at others indignant, and\r\n     at others wrathful, interest.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Calvary.--foraging Party Returning To Camp.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"THREE YEARS IN THE FEDERAL CAVALRY.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  Another work by Captain Glazier.--\"Three Years in the Federal\r\n    Cavalry.\"--Daring deeds of the Light Dragoons.--Extracts from the\r\n    work.--Night attack on Falmouth Heights.--Kilpatrick's\r\n    stratagem.--Flight of the enemy.--Capture of Falmouth.--Burial of\r\n    Lieutenant Decker.--Incidents at \"Brandy Station.\"--\"Harris\r\n    Light\" and \"Tenth New York.\"--\"Men of Maine, you must save the\r\n    day!\"--Position won.--Some Press reviews of the work.\r\n\r\nThrough earnest and continued application our soldier-author had, in the\r\nmeantime, produced another book of equal merit with his first. This he\r\nnamed, \"Three Years in the Federal Cavalry.\" It is a work of thrilling\r\ninterest, and contains much of history relating to the Civil War, and\r\nmore especially to the cavalry service. It was the opinion of Captain\r\nGlazier that the Union cavalry had never been properly appreciated, and\r\nfor this reason he took up his pen in its defense. He narrates the\r\ndaring deeds of our Light Dragoons, their brilliant achievements during\r\nthe first three eventful years of the war; and his own personal\r\nexperiences are pictured with a vividness of color and an enthusiasm of\r\nmanner which carry the reader straight to the field of action.\r\n\r\nWe quote the following brief but graphic description of the opening of\r\nthe great Rebellion, as a specimen of the style of this second product\r\nof his intellect:\r\n\r\n\"The eleventh of April, 1861, revealed the real intention of the\r\nSouthern people in their unprovoked assault upon Fort Sumpter. The\r\nthunder of rebel cannon shook the air not only around Charleston, but\r\nsent its thrilling vibrations to the remotest sections of the country,\r\nand was the precursor of a storm whose wrath no one anticipated. This\r\nshock of arms was like a fire-alarm in our great cities, and the North\r\narose in its might with a grand unanimity which the South did not\r\nexpect. The spirit and principle of rebellion were so uncaused and\r\nunprovoked, that scarcely could any one be found at home or abroad to\r\njustify them.\r\n\r\n\"President Lincoln thereupon issued a call for seventy-five thousand men\r\nto uphold and vindicate the authority of the government, and to prove,\r\nif possible, that secession was not only a heresy in doctrine, but an\r\nimpracticability in the American Republic. The response to this call was\r\nmuch more general than the most sanguine had any reason to look for. The\r\nenthusiasm of the people was quite unbounded. Individuals encouraged\r\nindividuals; families aroused families; communities vied with\r\ncommunities, and States strove with States. Who could be the first and\r\ndo the most, was the noble contention which everywhere prevailed. All\r\npolitical party lines seemed to be obliterated. Under this renovating\r\nand inspiring spirit the work of raising the nucleus of the grandest\r\narmy that ever swept a continent went bravely on. Regiments were rapidly\r\norganized, and as rapidly as possible sent forward to the seat of\r\ngovernment; and so vast was the number that presented themselves for\r\ntheir country's defence, that the original call was soon more than\r\nfilled, and the authorities found themselves unable to accept many\r\norganizations which were eager to press into the fray.\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile the great leaders of the rebellion were marshalling the\r\nhordes of treason, and assembling them on the plains of Manassas, with\r\nthe undoubted intention of moving upon the national capital. This point\r\ndetermined the principal theatre of the opening contest, and around it\r\non every side, and particularly southward, was to be the aceldama of\r\nAmerica, the dreadful 'field of blood.'\r\n\r\n\"The first great impulse of the authorities was in the direction of\r\nself-defence, and Washington was fortified and garrisoned. This done, it\r\nwas believed that the accumulating forces of the Union, which had become\r\nthoroughly equipped and somewhat disciplined, ought to advance into the\r\nrevolted Territory, scatter the defiant hosts of the enemy, and put a\r\nspeedy end to the slave-holders' rebellion.\"\r\n\r\nAgain we quote a description of an incident of the cavalry fight at\r\nBrandy Station:\r\n\r\n\"At a critical moment, when the formidable and ever increasing hosts of\r\nthe enemy were driving our forces from a desirable position we sought to\r\ngain, and when it seemed as though disaster to our arms would be fatal,\r\nKilpatrick's battle-flag was seen advancing, followed by the tried\r\nsquadrons of the 'Harris Light,' the 'Tenth New York,' and the 'First\r\nMaine.' In echelons of squadrons his brigade was quickly formed, and he\r\nadvanced, like a storm-cloud, upon the rebel cavalry, which filled the\r\nfield before him. The 'Tenth New York' received the first shock of the\r\nrebel charge, but was hurled back, though not in confusion. The 'Harris\r\nLight' met with no better success, and, notwithstanding their prestige\r\nand power, they were repulsed under the very eye of their chief, whose\r\nexcitement at the scene was well-nigh uncontrollable. His flashing eye\r\nnow turned to the 'First Maine,' a regiment composed mostly of heavy,\r\nsturdy men, who had not been engaged as yet during the day; and, riding\r\nto the head of the column, he shouted, 'Men of Maine, you must save the\r\nday! Follow me!' With one simultaneous war-cry these giants of the North\r\nmoved forward in one solid mass upon the flank of the rebel columns. The\r\nshock was overwhelming, and the opposing lines crumbled like a 'bowing\r\nwall' before this wild rush of prancing horses, gleaming sabres, and\r\nrattling balls.\r\n\r\n\"On rode Kilpatrick, with the 'men of Maine,' and, on meeting the two\r\nregiments of his brigade, which had been repulsed, and were returning\r\nfrom the front, the General's voice rang out like trumpet notes, above\r\nthe din of battle, 'Back, the \"Harris Light!\" Back, the \"Tenth New\r\nYork!\" Reform your squadrons and charge!' With magical alacrity the\r\norder was obeyed, and the two regiments, which had been so humbled by\r\ntheir first reverse, now rushed into the fight with a spirit and success\r\nwhich redeemed them from censure, and accounted them worthy of their\r\ngallant leader. The commanding position was won; a battery, lost in a\r\nprevious charge, was re-captured, and an effectual blow was given to the\r\nenemy, which greatly facilitated the movements which followed.\"\r\n\r\nFrom numerous press notices, eulogistic of this work, which appeared\r\nshortly after its publication, we select the following from the Chicago\r\n_Times_:\r\n\r\n     \"For the thousands of warriors who entered upon life too late to\r\n     participate in the war of the rebellion; for the thousands who\r\n     entered upon life too soon to be permitted a sight of its glorious\r\n     and hideous scenes; for the thousands who snuffed the smoke of\r\n     battle from afar; no better book could have been produced than this\r\n     'Three Years in the Federal Cavalry.' ... It tells them in\r\n     thrilling and glowing language of the most exciting phases of the\r\n     contests.... It is a book that will thrill the heart of every old\r\n     soldier who reads its historic pages.... The author carries his\r\n     readers into every scene which he depicts. Throughout the book one\r\n     is impressed with the idea that he saw all that he describes....\r\n     The triumphs, the despondencies, the sufferings, the joys of the\r\n     troops, are feelingly and vigorously painted.... His book is a\r\n     noble tribute to the gallant horsemen, who have too often been\r\n     overlooked.\"\r\n\r\nThe Syracuse _Herald_ remarks:\r\n\r\n     \"Among the newest, and we may truly say the best of the books on\r\n     the civil war, is a work by the widely-known author, Captain\r\n     Willard Glazier, entitled 'Three Years in the Federal Cavalry.'...\r\n     Its pages teem with word-painting of hair-breadth escapes, of\r\n     marches, of countermarches, bivouacs and battles without number.\r\n     Stirring memories of Brandy Station, Chantilly, Antietam,\r\n     Fredericksburg, Yorktown, Falmouth and Gettysburg, are roused by\r\n     the masterly _raconteur_, until in October, 1864, just beyond New\r\n     Baltimore, the gallant captain was captured, and for a year\r\n     languished in 'durance vile.' The interest in the narrative never\r\n     flags, but rather increases with each succeeding page. For those\r\n     who love to fight their battles o'er again, or those who love to\r\n     read of war's alarms, this volume will prove most welcome.\"\r\n\r\nThe New York _Tribune_ is\r\n\r\n     \"Sure that 'Three Years in the Federal Cavalry' will meet with the\r\n     same generous reception from the reading public that has been given\r\n     to the former works of this talented young author. The fact that\r\n     Captain Glazier was an eye-witness and participant in the thrilling\r\n     scenes of which he writes, lends additional interest to the work.\"\r\n\r\nThe New York _Star_ says:\r\n\r\n     \"'Three Years in the Federal Cavalry' brings to light many daring\r\n     deeds upon the part of the Union heroes, that have never yet been\r\n     recorded, and gives an insight into the conduct of the war which\r\n     historians, who write but do not fight, could not possibly give. It\r\n     is full of incident, and one of the most interesting books upon the\r\n     war that we have read.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the New York _Globe_ we cull the following:\r\n\r\n     \"To a returned soldier nothing is more welcome than conversation\r\n     touching his experience 'in the field' with his companions, and\r\n     next to this a good book written by one who has known 'how it is\r\n     himself,' and who recounts vividly the scenes of strife through\r\n     which he has passed. Such a work is 'Three Years in the Federal\r\n     Cavalry.' Captain Glazier's experiences are portrayed in a manner\r\n     at once interesting to the veteran, and instructive and\r\n     entertaining to those who have but snuffed the battle from afar. An\r\n     old soldier will never drop this book for an instant, if he once\r\n     begins it, until every word has been read. There is an air of truth\r\n     pervading every page which chains the veteran to it until he is\r\n     stared in the face with 'Finis.' The details and influences of\r\n     camp-life, the preparations for active duty, the weary marches to\r\n     the battle-field, the bivouac at night, the fierce hand-to-hand\r\n     strife, the hospital, the dying volunteer, the dead one--buried in\r\n     his blanket by the pale light of the moon, far, far away from those\r\n     he loves--the defeat and victory--every scene, in fact, familiar to\r\n     the eye and ear of the 'boy in blue,' is here most truthfully and\r\n     clearly photographed, and the soldier is once more transported back\r\n     to the days of the rebellion. Captain Glazier's style is easy and\r\n     explicit. He makes no endeavor to be poetic or eloquent, but tells\r\n     his story in a straightforward manner, occasionally, however,\r\n     approaching eloquence in spite of himself. We cheerfully and\r\n     earnestly commend 'Three Years in the Federal Cavalry' to the\r\n     public as a most readable, entertaining and instructive volume.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Cavalry Bivouac]\r\n\r\nAmong the manifold testimonials we have seen to the merits of this work,\r\nthe following from the poetic pen of Mrs. Maud Louise Brainerd, of\r\nElmira, New York, is at once beautiful and eloquent of praise, and\r\nmust not therefore be omitted from the chaplet we are weaving for the\r\nbrow of the 'soldier-author:'\r\n\r\n    \"Have you heard of our Union Cavalry,\r\n      As Glazier tells the story?\r\n    Of the dashing boys of the 'Cavalry Corps,'\r\n      And their daring deeds of glory?\r\n\r\n    \"This modest volume holds it all,\r\n      Their brave exploits revealing,\r\n    Told as a comrade tells the tale,\r\n      With all a comrade's feeling.\r\n\r\n    \"The Union camp-fires blaze anew,\r\n      Upon these faithful pages,\r\n    Anew we tremble while we read\r\n      How hot the warfare rages.\r\n\r\n    \"We hear again the shock of arms,\r\n      The cannon's direful thunder,\r\n    And feel once more the wild suspense\r\n      That then our hearts throbbed under.\r\n\r\n    \"The deeds of heroes live again\r\n      Amid the battle crashes,\r\n    As, Phoenix-like, the dead take form\r\n      And rise from out their ashes.\r\n\r\n    \"Where darkest hangs the cloud and smoke,\r\n      Where weaker men might falter,\r\n    The brave Phil Kearney lays his life\r\n      Upon his country's altar.\r\n\r\n    \"Kilpatrick's legions thunder by,\r\n      With furious clang and clatter,\r\n    Rushing where duty sternly leads,\r\n      To life or death--no matter!\r\n\r\n    \"Oh, hero-warriors, patriots true!\r\n      Within your graves now lying,\r\n    How bright on History's page to-day\r\n      Shines out your fame undying!\r\n\r\n    \"The pomp and panoply of war\r\n      Have vanished; all the glitter\r\n    Of charging columns, marching hosts\r\n      And battles long and bitter,\r\n\r\n    \"Recede with the receding years,\r\n      Wrapped in old Time's dim shadow;\r\n    Where once the soil drank patriot gore,\r\n      Green, now, grow field and meadow.\r\n\r\n    \"But here the written record stands\r\n      Of all that time of glory,\r\n    And bright through every age shall live\r\n      These names in song and story.\r\n\r\n    \"Willard Glazier wrote his name\r\n      First in war's deeds, then slipping\r\n    His fingers off the sword, he found\r\n      The mightier pen more fitting.\r\n\r\n    \"Read but the book--'twill summon back\r\n      The spirits now immortal,\r\n    Who bravely died for fatherland\r\n      And passed the heavenly portal!\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the demand for the work that one hundred and seventy-five\r\nthousand copies of it were sold, and we may safely predicate that in the\r\nhomes of thousands of veterans scattered all over the land, the book has\r\nbeen a source of profound interest in the help it has afforded them in\r\nrecounting to family and friends the thrilling events of their war\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"BATTLES FOR THE UNION.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Battles for the Union.\"--Extracts.--Bull Run.--Brandy\r\n    Station.--Manassas.--Gettysburg.--Pittsburg Landing.--Surrender\r\n    of General Lee.--Opinions of the press.--Philadelphia \"North\r\n    American.\"--Pittsburg \"Commercial.\"--Chicago\r\n    \"Inter-Ocean.\"--Scranton \"Republican.\"--Wilkes-Barre \"Record of\r\n    the Times.\"--Reading \"Eagle.\"--Albany \"Evening Journal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Battles for the Union,\"--published by Dustin Gilman and Company,\r\nHartford, Connecticut--was the next work that emanated from our soldier\r\nauthor's prolific pen. The most stubbornly contested battles of the\r\ngreat Rebellion herein find forcible and picturesque description. \"I\r\nhave endeavored,\" Glazier writes in his preface to this interesting\r\nwork, \"in 'Battles for the Union' to present, in the most concise and\r\nsimple form, the great contests in the war for the preservation of the\r\nRepublic of the United States;\" and as evidence of the manner in which\r\nthis task was undertaken, we shall again present to the reader some\r\npassages from the work itself.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of descriptive clearness and force, combined with\r\nconciseness and simplicity of narrative, we present the opening of the\r\nchapter on Bull Run:\r\n\r\n\"The field of Bull Run and the plains of Manassas will never lose their\r\ninterest for the imaginative young or the patriotic old; for on this\r\nfield and over these plains are scattered the bones of more than forty\r\nthousand brave men of both North and South, who have met in mortal\r\ncombat and laid down their lives in defence of their principles.\r\n\r\n\"On the twenty-first of July, 1861, was fought the battle of Bull Run,\r\nthe first of a long series of engagements on these historic plains. The\r\nbattles of Bristoe, Groveton, Manassas, Centreville, and Chantilly\r\nsucceeded in 1862, and in the summer and autumn of 1863 followed the\r\ncavalry actions at Aldie, Middleburg, Upperville, and New Baltimore.\r\n\r\n\"No battle-ground on the continent of America can present to the\r\ngenerations yet to come such a gigantic Roll of Honor. Here also was\r\ndisplayed the best military talent, the keenest strategy, and the\r\nhighest engineering skill of our civil war. Here were assembled the\r\ngreat representative leaders of slavery and freedom. Here Scott,\r\nMcDowell, Pope, and Meade on the Federal side, and Beauregard, Johnson,\r\nand Lee on the Confederate side, have in turn held the reins of battle\r\nand shared both victory and defeat.\r\n\r\n\"The action which resulted in the fall of Fort Sumter developed\r\nextraordinary talent in the rebel General P. G. T. Beauregard, and\r\nbrought him conspicuously before the Confederate government. Called for\r\nby the unanimous voice of the Southern people, he was now ordered to\r\ntake command of the main portion of the Confederate army in northern\r\nVirginia. He selected Manassas Junction as his base of operations, and\r\nestablished his outposts near Fairfax Court-House, seventeen miles from\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\n\"General Beauregard's forces, on the line of Bull Run, numbered on the\r\nsixteenth of July nearly forty thousand men, and sixty-four pieces of\r\nartillery, together with a considerable body of cavalry. The threatening\r\nattitude of this force, almost within sight of the National capital, led\r\nGeneral Scott to concentrate the Union forces in that quarter with a\r\nview to meeting the Confederates in battle, and, if possible, giving a\r\ndeath-blow to the rebellion.\r\n\r\n\"Ludicrous, indeed, in the light of subsequent events, was the general\r\nconviction of the hostile sections, that a single decisive engagement\r\nwould terminate the war. Little did the Unionists then know of the\r\nambitious designs of the pro-slavery leaders, and still less did the\r\nuneducated, misguided masses of the South know of the patriotism,\r\nresources, and invincible determination of the North. On both sides\r\nthere was great popular anxiety for a general battle to determine the\r\nquestion of relative manhood: and especially on the side of the South,\r\nfrom an impression that one distinct and large combat resulting in its\r\nfavor, and showing conspicuously its superior valor, would alarm the\r\nNorth sufficiently to lead it to abandon the war. The New York\r\n_Tribune_, which was supposed at that time to be a faithful\r\nrepresentative of the sentiment and temper of the North, said, on the\r\nnineteenth of July, 1861: 'We have been most anxious that this struggle\r\nshould be submitted at the earliest moment to the ordeal of a fair,\r\ndecisive battle. Give the Unionists a fair field, equal weapons and\r\nequal numbers, and we ask no more. Should the rebel forces at all\r\njustify the vaunts of their journalistic trumpeters, we shall candidly\r\nadmit the fact. If they can beat double the number of Unionists, they\r\ncan end the struggle on their own terms.\r\n\r\n\"A field for the grand combat was soon found, but its results were\r\ndestined to disappoint both the victors and the vanquished. The South\r\nhad looked forward to this field for an acknowledgment of its\r\nindependence; the North for a downfall of the rebellion.\"\r\n\r\nThe chapter on \"Brandy Station\" affords several illustrations of our\r\nauthor's glowing descriptive power, thus:\r\n\r\n\"The words Brandy Station will ever excite a multitude of thrilling\r\nmemories in the minds of all cavalrymen who saw service in Virginia, for\r\nthis was the grand cavalry battle-ground of the war.\r\n\r\n\"On these historic plains our Bayard, Stoneman, and Pleasanton have\r\nsuccessively led their gallant troopers against the commands of Stuart,\r\nLee, and Hampton. The twentieth of August, 1862, the ninth of June,\r\ntwelfth of September, and eleventh of October, 1863, are days which\r\ncannot soon be forgotten by the 'Boys in Blue' who crossed sabres with\r\nthe Confederates at Brandy Station.\r\n\r\n\"Converging and diverging roads at this point quite naturally brought\r\nthe cavalry of the contending armies together whenever we advanced to,\r\nor retired from, the Rapidan. Being both the advance and rear-guard of\r\nthe opposing forces, our horsemen always found themselves face to face\r\nwith the foe on this field; in fact, most of our cavalrymen were so\r\nconfident of a fight here, that as soon as we discovered that we were\r\napproaching the station we prepared for action by tightening our\r\nsaddle-girths and inspecting our arms.\r\n\r\n\"Upon the withdrawal of the Army of the Potomac from the Peninsula,\r\nGeneral Lee, contemplating the invasion of Maryland and Pennsylvania,\r\nstarted his army northward with the view, no doubt, of driving Pope\r\nfrom northern Virginia, and carrying the Confederate standard into the\r\nloyal States. The battle of Cedar Mountain temporarily checked his\r\nforward movement and compelled him to retire to the south bank of the\r\nRapidan. The reappearance of rebel skirmishers at the various fords of\r\nthe river on the morning of August the eighteenth, 1862, was an evidence\r\nto our pickets that the enemy was about to resume hostilities.\r\n\r\n\"General Pope at once ordered his artillery and infantry to retire\r\nbeyond the Rappahannock, while General Bayard, commanding the cavalry,\r\nwas charged with covering the rear of the retiring army. We disputed the\r\nadvance of the rebels so stubbornly that they found no opportunity to\r\ninterfere with the retreat of the main column. The morning of the\r\ntwentieth found the 'Harris Light,' Tenth New York, First Pennsylvania,\r\nFirst Maine, First Rhode Island, and First New Jersey Cavalry,\r\nbivouacked at Brandy Station.\r\n\r\n\"The engagement opened at six o'clock by an attack of Stuart's cavalry\r\nupon the 'Harris Light' acting as rear-guard of Bayard's brigade.\r\n\r\n\"This preliminary onset was speedily repulsed by the 'Harris Light,'\r\nwhich regiment kept the enemy in check until General Bayard had gained\r\nsufficient time to enable him to form his command at a more favorable\r\npoint, two miles north of the station, on the direct road to the\r\nRappahannock. Here the 'Harris Light' led by Colonel Kilpatrick and\r\nMajor Davies, again charged the advanced regiments of the Confederate\r\ncolumn, thus opening the series of memorable conflicts at Brandy\r\nStation, and adding fresh laurels to its already famous record. A deep\r\ncut in a hill, through which the Orange and Alexandria Railroad passes,\r\nchecked our pursuit, else we should have captured many prisoners. The\r\nFirst New Jersey and First Pennsylvania coming to our relief enabled us\r\nto reform our broken squadrons, and, as Pope had instructed General\r\nBayard not to bring on a general engagement, the cavalry now crossed the\r\nRappahannock and awaited the orders of the general-in-chief.\"\r\n\r\nThe following description of \"Manassas or Second Bull Run\" shows great\r\nmastery of his subject, and the possession of a facile and impartial\r\npen:\r\n\r\n\"On the twenty-ninth of August, 1862, the storm of battle again broke\r\nover the plains of Manassas, and surged furiously along the borders of\r\nBull Run creek and down the Warrenton pike. The figure of General Franz\r\nSigel stands out in bold relief against the background of battle, the\r\nfirst actor appearing on the scene in this drama of war and death.\r\n\r\n\"The time is daybreak, and the rosy light of early dawn, so peaceful and\r\nso pure, flushes the sky in painful contrast to the scenes of strife and\r\nbloodshed below.\r\n\r\n\"At noon on the day previous, General Pope had ordered Reno, Kearney and\r\nHooker to follow Jackson, who, through the miscarriage of well-laid\r\nplans, had been allowed to escape in the direction of Centreville.\r\nMcDowell's command, then on the way to Manassas, was ordered to march to\r\nCentreville, while Porter was directed to come forward to Manassas\r\nJunction. The orders were promptly executed by the various commands,\r\nexcepting that of Fitz-John Porter, who unaccountably on loyal\r\nprinciples, remained inactive during the ensuing contest. Kearney drove\r\nthe enemy out of Centreville, and in their retreat along the Warrenton\r\nRoad they encountered the division of King, McDowell's advance, marching\r\neastward to intercept them.\r\n\r\n\"A sharp fight took place, terminating to the advantage of neither, and\r\nat night the contestants bivouacked near the battle-field.\r\n\r\n\"On the night of the twenty-eighth, Pope's forces were so disposed that\r\ntwenty-five thousand men under McDowell, Sigel and Reynolds, were ready\r\nto attack Jackson from the south and west, and the corps of Reno,\r\nHeintzelman, and Porter, consisting of an equal number of troops, were\r\nto complete the attack from the east. Lee was pushing forward his forces\r\nto support Jackson at Thoroughfare Gap, and it was necessary for the\r\nUnion army to use all possible celerity of movement, in order to make\r\nthe attack before the main movement of the Confederate army under Lee\r\ncould come up. But this combination failed like many another, and during\r\nthe night King's division fell back towards Manassas Junction, at which\r\nplace Porter's Corps had recently arrived, and the road to Gainsville\r\nand Thoroughfare Gap was thus left open to Jackson. A new arrangement of\r\ntroops became therefore necessary.\"...\r\n\r\nThere are several fine passages in the description of the battle of\r\nGettysburg which show graphic power, and penetration into the motives of\r\nthe leaders. The story of this sanguinary struggle for victory is well\r\ntold throughout. We extract the following:\r\n\r\n\"Night came on to close the dreadful day. Thus far the battle had been\r\nmostly to the advantage of the rebels. They held the ground where\r\nReynolds had fallen, also Seminary Ridge, and the elevation whence the\r\nEleventh Corps had been driven. They also occupied the ridge on which\r\nSickles had commenced to fight. Sickles himself was _hors du combat_\r\nwith a shattered leg, which had to be amputated, and not far from twenty\r\nthousand of our men had been killed, wounded, and captured. The rebels\r\nhad also lost heavily in killed and wounded, but having gained several\r\nimportant positions, were deluded with the idea that they had gained a\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"During these days of deadly strife and of unprecedented slaughter, our\r\ncavalry was by no means idle. On the morning of the first, Kilpatrick\r\nadvanced his victorious squadrons to the vicinity of Abbottstown, where\r\nthey struck a force of rebel cavalry, which they scattered, capturing\r\nseveral prisoners, and then rested. To the ears of the alert cavalry\r\nchieftain came the sound of battle at Gettysburg, accompanied with the\r\nintelligence, from prisoners mostly, that Stuart's main force was bent\r\non doing mischief on the right of our infantry lines, which were not far\r\nfrom the night's bivouac.\r\n\r\n\"He appeared instinctively to know where he was most needed; so, in the\r\nabsence of orders, early the next morning he advanced on Hunterstown. At\r\nthis point were the extreme wings of the infantry lines, and as\r\nKilpatrick expected, he encountered the rebel cavalry, commanded by his\r\nold antagonists, Stuart, Lee and Hampton. The early part of the day was\r\nspent mostly in reconnoitring, but all the latter part of the day was\r\noccupied in hard, bold, and bloody work. Charges and counter-charges\r\nwere made; the carbine, pistol and sabre were used by turns, and the\r\nartillery thundered long after the infantry around Gettysburg had sunk\r\nto rest, well-nigh exhausted with the bloody carnage of the weary day.\r\nBut Stuart, who had hoped to break in upon our flank and rear, and to\r\npounce upon our trains, was not only foiled in his endeavor by the\r\ngallant Kilpatrick, but also driven back upon his infantry supports and\r\nbadly beaten.\r\n\r\n\"In the night, Kilpatrick, after leaving a sufficient force to prevent\r\nStuart from doing any special damage on our right, swung around with the\r\nremainder of his division to the left of our line, near Round Top, and\r\nwas there prepared for any work which might be assigned him.\r\n\r\n\"Friday, July third, the sun rose bright and warm upon the blackened\r\nforms of the dead which were strewn over the bloody earth; upon the\r\nwounded, who had not been cared for, and upon long glistening lines of\r\narmed men, ready to renew the conflict. Each antagonist, rousing every\r\nslumbering element of power, seemed to be resolved upon victory or\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\"The fight commenced early, by an attack of General Slocum's men, who,\r\ndetermined to regain the rifle-pits they had lost the evening before,\r\ndescended like an avalanche upon the foe. The attack met with a prompt\r\nresponse from General Ewell. But after several hours of desperate\r\nfighting, victory perched upon the Union banners, and with great loss\r\nand slaughter, the rebels were driven out of the breast-works, and fell\r\nback upon their main lines near Benner's Hill.\r\n\r\n\"This successful move upon the part of our Boys in Blue was followed by\r\nan ominous lull or quiet, which continued about three hours. Meanwhile\r\nthe silence was fitfully broken by an occasional spit of fire, while\r\nevery preparation was being made for a last, supreme effort, which it\r\nwas expected would decide the mighty contest. The scales were being\r\npoised for the last time, and upon the one side or the other was soon to\r\nbe recorded a glorious victory or a disastrous defeat. Hearts either\r\ntrembled, or waxed strong in the awful presence of this responsibility.\r\n\r\n\"At length one o'clock arrived, a signal-gun was fired, and then at\r\nleast one hundred and twenty-five guns from Hill and Longstreet\r\nconcentrated and crossed their fires upon Cemetery Hill, the centre and\r\nkey of our position. Just behind this crest, though much exposed, were\r\nGeneral Meade's headquarters. For nearly two hours this hill was plowed\r\nand torn by solid shot and bursting shell, while about one hundred guns\r\non our side, mainly from this crest and Round Top, made sharp response.\r\nThe earth and the air shook for miles around with the terrific\r\nconcussion, which came no longer in volleys, but in a continual roar. So\r\nlong and fearful a cannonade was never before witnessed on this\r\ncontinent. As the range was short and the aim accurate, the destruction\r\nwas terrible.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Gradually the fire on our side began to slacken, and General Meade,\r\nlearning that our guns were becoming hot, gave orders to cease firing\r\nand to let the guns cool, though the rebel balls were making fearful\r\nhavoc among our gunners, while our infantry sought poor shelter behind\r\nevery projection, anxiously awaiting the expected charge. At length the\r\nenemy, supposing that our guns were silenced, deemed that the moment for\r\nan irresistible attack had come. Accordingly, as a lion emerges from\r\nhis lair, he sallied forth, when strong lines of infantry, nearly three\r\nmiles in length, with double lines of skirmishers in front, and heavy\r\nreserves in rear, advanced with desperation to the final effort. They\r\nmoved with steady, measured tread over the plain below, and began the\r\nascent of the hills occupied by our forces, concentrating somewhat upon\r\nGeneral Hancock, though stretching across our entire front.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"General Picket's division was nearly annihilated. One of his officers\r\nrecounted that, as they were charging over the grassy plain, he threw\r\nhimself down before a murderous discharge of grape and canister, which\r\nmowed the grass and men all around him as though a scythe had been swung\r\njust above his prostrate form.\r\n\r\n\"During the terrific cannonade and subsequent charges, our ammunition\r\nand other trains had been parked in rear of Round Top, which gave them\r\nsplendid shelter. Partly to possess this train, but mainly to secure\r\nthis commanding position, General Longstreet sent two strong divisions\r\nof infantry, with heavy artillery, to turn our flank, and drive us from\r\nthis ground. Kilpatrick, with his division, which had been strengthened\r\nby Merritt's regulars, was watching this point and waiting for an\r\nopportunity to strike the foe. It came at last. Emerging from the woods\r\nin front of him came a strong battle-line, followed by others.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Battle Of Gettysburg.]\r\n\r\n\"To the young Farnsworth was committed the task of meeting infantry with\r\ncavalry in an open field. Placing the Fifth New York in support of\r\nElder's battery, which was exposed to a galling fire, but made reply\r\nwith characteristic rapidity, precision and slaughter, Farnsworth\r\nquickly ordered the First Virginia, the First Vermont, and Eighteenth\r\nPennsylvania in line of battle, and galloped away and charged upon the\r\nflank of the advancing columns. The attack was sharp, brief and\r\nsuccessful, though attended with great slaughter. But the rebels were\r\ndriven upon their main lines, and the flank movement was prevented. Thus\r\nthe cavalry added another dearly earned laurel to its chaplet of\r\nhonor--_dearly earned_, because many of their bravest champions fell\r\nupon that bloody field.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Thus ended the battle of Gettysburg--the bloody turning-point of the\r\nrebellion--the bloody baptism of the redeemed republic. Nearly twenty\r\nthousand men from the Union ranks had been killed and wounded, and a\r\nlarger number of the rebels, making the enormous aggregate of at least\r\nforty thousand, whose blood was shed to fertilize the Tree of Liberty.\"\r\n\r\nThe following peroration to the glowing account of the battle of\r\nPittsburg Landing, we quote as an illustration of the vein of poetry\r\nthat pervades his writings:\r\n\r\n\"Thus another field of renown was added to the list, so rapidly\r\nincreased during these years; where valor won deathless laurels, and\r\nprinciple was reckoned weighter than life.\r\n\r\n\"Peacefully the Tennessee flows between its banks onward to the ocean,\r\nnor tells aught of the bloody struggle on its shore. Quietly the golden\r\ngrain ripens in the sun, and the red furrow of war is supplanted by the\r\nplowshares of peace. To the child born within the shadow of this\r\nbattle-field, who listens wonderingly to a recital of the deeds of this\r\nday, the heroes of Shiloh will, mayhap, appear like the dim phantoms of\r\na dream, shadowy and unreal, but the results they helped to bring about\r\nare the tissue of a people's life; the dust he treads is the sacred soil\r\nfrom which sprang the flowers of freedom, and the institutions for which\r\nthese men died, make his roof safe over his head.\"\r\n\r\nWe conclude our extracts from the volume with a part of the chapter on\r\n\"The Surrender.\" The story is told without flourish of trumpets, and in\r\na manner to give no offense to the vanquished, while its strict and\r\nimpartial adherence to truth must recommend it to all readers:\r\n\r\n\"The last act in the great drama of the war took place without dramatic\r\naccessory. There was no startling tableau, with the chief actors grouped\r\nin effective attitudes, surrounded by their attendants. No spreading\r\ntree lent its romance to the occasion, as some artists have fondly\r\nsupposed.\r\n\r\n\"A plain farm-house between the lines was selected by General Lee for\r\nthe surrender, and the ceremony of that act was short and simple. The\r\nnoble victor did not complete the humiliation of the brave vanquished by\r\nany triumphal display or blare of trumpets. In his magnanimity he even\r\nomitted the customary usage of allowing the victorious troops to pass\r\nthrough the enemy's lines and witness their surrender. The two great\r\ncommanders met with courteous salutation, General Lee being attended by\r\nonly one of his aides. General Grant sat down at a table in the barely\r\nfurnished room and wrote in lead-pencil the terms of capitulation, to\r\nwhich Lee dictated an agreement in writing. His secretary, Colonel\r\nMarshall, and Colonel Badeau, the secretary of General Grant, made\r\ncopies of the agreement from the same bottle of ink.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"The final situation of the Confederate army before its surrender was\r\nindeed desperate--its environments hopeless. Hemmed in at Appomattox\r\nCourt House, on a strip of land between the Appomattox and James rivers,\r\nthe Union army nearly surrounded it on all sides. Sheridan was in front,\r\nMeade in the rear, and Ord south of the Court House. Lee had no\r\nalternative other than the wholesale slaughter of his reduced army, or\r\nits surrender to Federal authority. He wisely chose the latter.\r\n\r\n\"The decisive battle of Five Forks had put his army to rout, and sent it\r\nin rapid retreat towards the junction of the Southside and Danville\r\nrailroads at Burkesville. The Union troops pressed forward in pursuit,\r\nand it became a vital question which would reach the junction first.\r\nBetween Petersburg, their point of starting, and their destination, at\r\nBurkesville, the distance was fifty-three miles. The roads were bad, and\r\nthe troops tired with two days' fighting; but they pushed on with\r\ndetermination in this race which was destined to decide the fate of two\r\narmies.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"It was Palm Sunday, April the ninth, 1865, when the capitulation was\r\nsigned, in the plain frame dwelling near Appomattox Court House.\r\n\r\n\"One is often struck with the curious coincidences--the apparent\r\nsympathy between nature and important human events. The dying hours of\r\nCromwell and Napoleon were marked by violent storms. Omens in earth and\r\nsky were the precursors of the death of Julius Caesar and King Duncan. A\r\ngreat comet heralded the opening of the war, and Palm Sunday--the day\r\nwhich commemorates the victorious entry of Christ into Jerusalem,\r\nushered in the welcome reign of peace. The time was auspicious; the\r\nelements were rocked to sleep in a kind of Sunday repose. The two\r\narmies, so long in deadly hostility, were now facing each other with\r\nguns strangely hushed. An expectant silence pervaded the air. Every\r\nheart was anxiously awaiting the result of the conference in the\r\nhistoric farm-house.\r\n\r\n\"When at last the news of the surrender flashed along the lines,\r\ndeafening cheers rose and fell for more than half an hour, over the\r\nvictorious Union army. Other than this, there was no undue triumphal\r\ndisplay of the victors over the conquered foe.... The shout of joy which\r\nwas sent up that day from Appomattox Court House echoed through the\r\nentire North. Cannons boomed forth their iron paeans of victory; the glad\r\nclash of bells was heard ringing 'peace and freedom in,' and bonfires\r\nflamed high their attestation of the unbounded delight everywhere\r\nexhibited. The day of jubilee seemed to have come, and rejoicing was the\r\norder of the hour. The storm of war which had rocked the country for\r\nfour long years, was now rolling away, and the sunlight of peace fell\r\nathwart the national horizon. The country for which Washington fought\r\nand Warren fell was once more safe from treason's hands, and liberty was\r\nagain the heritage of the people.\"\r\n\r\nThe Northern and Western press, as heretofore, again bore its flattering\r\ntestimony to our author's diligence, truthfulness and loyalty to his\r\ncolors; and to the surprising facility with which a soldier could\r\nsheathe his sword and wield a pen, charming alike the veteran by his\r\ndetails of valor, and the mother, wife and sister by his stories of\r\npathos from the battle-field.\r\n\r\nThe following is from the Philadelphia _North American_:\r\n\r\n     \"'Battles for the Union.'--Thoroughly representative of the courage\r\n     and ability shown on either side in the great struggle that lasted\r\n     from the close of 1860 to April, 1865. It is not the purpose of the\r\n     author to present a standard and critical work like the works of\r\n     Jomini, Napier and Allison; nor to include a discussion of\r\n     political questions. His aim is rather to furnish a vivid and\r\n     correct account of the principal battles in such simple and\r\n     intelligible terms that every reader may gain a precise idea of\r\n     each. His style is rather graphic and vigorous than ornate. He\r\n     introduces effective details and personal episodes. His facts are\r\n     gleaned from a variety of sources as well as from personal\r\n     knowledge; and though proud of his own cause and of his companions,\r\n     he does not belittle their renown by decrying the valor or the\r\n     intelligence of his opponents. The conflicts themselves will never\r\n     be forgotten. It is desirable that they shall be kept vivid and\r\n     clear in the minds of the rising generation, to cultivate a correct\r\n     idea of the necessity of personal valor and of military preparation\r\n     and capacity, as well as impress a serious idea of the momentous\r\n     importance of political issues. Captain Glazier's volume is\r\n     excellently fitted to instruct and interest everywhere.\"\r\n\r\nThe Pittsburg _Commercial_ says:\r\n\r\n     \"Commencing with the siege and final surrender of Fort Sumter, the\r\n     author traces the progress of the Union armies through all the\r\n     chief battles of the war, giving vivid and glowing descriptions of\r\n     the struggles at Big Bethel, Bull Run, Wilson's Creek, Ball's\r\n     Bluff, Mill Spring, Pea Ridge, the fight between the 'Merrimac' and\r\n     'Monitor,' Newbern, Falmouth Heights, Pittsburg Landing,\r\n     Williamsburg, Seven Pines, Fair Oaks, Malvern Hill, Cedar Mountain,\r\n     Brandy Station, Manassas or Second Bull Run, Chantilly, Antietam,\r\n     Corinth, Fredericksburg, Stone River, Chancellorsville, Aldie,\r\n     Upperville, Gettysburg, Vicksburg, Port Hudson, Falling Waters,\r\n     Chickamauga, Bristoe, New Baltimore, Fort Fisher, Olustee, Fort\r\n     Pillow, Cold Harbor, Fort Wagner, Cedar Creek, Waynesboro,\r\n     Bentonville, Five Forks, and down to the surrender of Lee. Captain\r\n     Glazier has evidently had access to the official records of the\r\n     war, and his narrative of the great events are therefore accurate.\r\n     The book is one the reading of which will make the blood tingle in\r\n     the veins of every soldier who took part in the late war, while it\r\n     will deeply interest every lover of his country. As a book for\r\n     boys, it has few, if any, superiors.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chicago _Inter-Ocean_ writes:\r\n\r\n     \"'Battles for the Union' is such a history as every soldier and\r\n     every man who has a pride in his country, should wish to possess.\r\n     Captain Glazier was no carpet knight. He shared the glories of the\r\n     Harris Light Cavalry in camp and field, earning his promotion from\r\n     the non-commissioned ranks to the command for which he was so\r\n     admirably fitted. There is the scent of powder in what he writes,\r\n     the vivid reality of sight and understanding. We are particularly\r\n     charmed with his style, which is plain, blunt, direct, and free\r\n     from strain or affectation. He describes the fights as they were\r\n     fought; individual deeds of bravery as they were performed; the\r\n     march and its trials; the defeat and its causes; the victory and\r\n     its effects. With the ardor of a young patriot, and the generous\r\n     admiration of a good soldier, he feels as great a pride in the\r\n     successes of a rival corps as in his own. Nor is this an unworthy\r\n     feature of his work, because the army was full of little, and\r\n     sometimes not particularly friendly, rivalries. Willard Glazier's\r\n     chapters, in which every battle may be regarded as a separate\r\n     picture, read like a grand panoramic view of gallant deeds and\r\n     warlike pageantries. If the author occasionally covers up a clear\r\n     defeat, excusing it with graceful art; if he feels disposed to\r\n     over-estimate a slight advantage, and to claim a victory where the\r\n     battle was evidently drawn, he errs upon the side of love for the\r\n     Boys in Blue, and pride in the flag under which he fought. The work\r\n     is divided into forty-four chapters, each containing a different\r\n     battle. We confidently recommend these graphic and life-like\r\n     pictures to the notice of our readers. They are thrilling as the\r\n     sound of the trumpet, and soul-inspiring as the songs of Ossian. We\r\n     call the reader's attention to the description of the combat\r\n     between the 'Merrimac' and 'Monitor' in chapter eight. It is\r\n     something which will fill with pride the sailor's heart.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"HEROES OF THREE WARS.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  Literary zeal.--\"Heroes of Three Wars\"--Extract from preface.--Sale\r\n    of the work.--Extracts: Washington.--Winfield Scott.--Zachary\r\n    Taylor.--Grant.--Sheridan.--Kilpatrick.--Press reviews, a few out\r\n    of many: Boston \"Transcript.\"--Chicago \"Inter-Ocean.\"--Baltimore\r\n    \"Sun.\"--Philadelphia \"Times.\"--Cincinnati \"Enquirer.\"--Worcester\r\n    \"Spy.\"--Pittsburg \"Gazette.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time our soldier-author found himself not only famous, but,\r\nthrough the enormous sale of his books, in comparatively affluent\r\ncircumstances. His literary zeal, however, was not yet spent, and work\r\nsucceeded work with a rapidity almost without parallel, while the extent\r\nof their sale exceeded anything hitherto known in the literary world.\r\n\r\n\"Heroes of Three Wars,\" issued by Hubbard Brothers, Philadelphia, the\r\nlatest production of his pen which he has as yet published, comprises\r\noriginal and life-like sketches of the brave soldiers of the\r\nRevolutionary, Mexican and Civil Wars; and the stories are told in a way\r\nthat is not easily forgotten. In the wide field presented by these three\r\nimportant epochs in the history of our country, Glazier has labored to\r\ninculcate in the minds of young Americans the virtues of gallantry, true\r\nworth, and patriotism; and his work is valuable as presenting to the\r\nstudent in a small compass, so much of interest in biography and\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nIn the preface to the work he observes: \"Washington, Scott and Grant are\r\nnames that will live forever in our history; not because they were the\r\nsubjects of a blind adulation, but because their worth was properly\r\nestimated, and their deeds truthfully recorded. The time for deifying\r\nmen has long since passed; we prefer to see them as they are--though\r\ngreat, still human, and surrounded with human infirmities; worthy of\r\nimmortal renown, not because they are unlike us, but because they excel\r\nus and have performed a work which entitles them to the lasting\r\ngratitude of their countrymen. Another object of this book is to group\r\naround these three generals, those officers and men who climbed to\r\nimmortality by their side, shared their fortunes, helped to win their\r\nvictories, and remained with them to the end.\" Again: \"Biographies\r\npossess but little value unless they give living portraits, so that each\r\nman stands out clear and distinct in his true character and\r\nproportions.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral thousand copies of this valuable work have already been called\r\nfor by the public, and it bids fair to equal its predecessors in amount\r\nof circulation. As a specimen of its style, we present to the reader the\r\nfollowing extract from the biographical sketch of Washington:--\"There is\r\na singular unanimity of opinion in ascribing to George Washington an\r\nexceptional character. It was certainly one of peculiar symmetry, in\r\nwhich a happy combination of qualities, moral, social and intellectual,\r\nwere guided to appropriate action by a remarkable power of clear\r\njudgment. It was just the combination calculated to lead a spirited and\r\nbrave people through such a trying crisis as the American Revolution.\r\nHis star was not dark and bright by turns--did not reveal itself in\r\nuncertain and fitful glimmerings--but shone with a full and steady\r\nluminosity across the troubled night of a nation's beginning. Under\r\nthese broad and beneficent rays the Ship of State was guided, through a\r\nsea of chaos, to safe anchorage. The voyage across those seven eventful\r\nyears was one that tried men's souls. Often, appalling dangers\r\nthreatened. Wreck on the rocks of Disunion, engulfment in the mountain\r\nwaves of opposition, starvation and doubt and mutiny on shipboard--these\r\nwere a few of the perils which beset their course. But a royal-souled\r\nCommander stood at the helm, and discerned, afar-off, the green shores\r\nof liberty. On this land the sunshine fell with fruitful power. The air\r\nwas sweet with the songs of birds. Contentment, peace, prosperity,\r\nreigned. Great possibilities were shadowed forth within its boundaries,\r\nand a young nation, growing rapidly towards a splendid era of\r\nenlightenment, was foreseen as a product of the near future. It took a\r\nman with deep faith in the ultimate rule of right and in humanity, to\r\noccupy that position; a man with large heart, with unselfish aims, with\r\nprophetic instincts, with clear and equalized brain. George Washington\r\npossessed all these qualities--and more!\"\r\n\r\nThe following is from the admirably graphic sketch of the sturdy\r\nsoldier, Winfield Scott: \"On the twenty-fifth of the same month (July,\r\n1814), a little below that sublime spot where the wide waste of waters\r\nwhich rush over the Falls of Niagara roar and thunder into the gulf\r\nbelow, and where Lundy's Lane meets the rapid river at right angles, was\r\nenacted the scene of conflict which took its name from the locality, and\r\nis variously called the battle of 'Lundy's Lane,' or 'Niagara.' The\r\naction began forty minutes before sunset, and it is recorded that the\r\nhead of the American column, as it advanced, was encircled by a\r\nrainbow--one which is often seen there, formed from the rising spray.\r\nThe happy omen faithfully prefigured the result; for when, under the\r\ncloudy sky of midnight the battle at length terminated, the Americans\r\nwere in possession of the field, and also the enemy's cannon, which had\r\nrained such deadly death into their ranks. In this action General Scott\r\nhad two horses killed under him, and about eleven o'clock at night he\r\nwas disabled by a musket-ball wound through the left shoulder. He had\r\npreviously been wounded, and at this juncture was borne from the fray.\r\nHe had piloted Miller's regiment through the darkness to the height on\r\nLundy's Lane, where the enemy's batteries were posted, and upon which\r\nthe grand charge was made that decided the battle. Throughout the action\r\nhe was the leading spirit of the occasion, giving personal direction to\r\nthe movements of his men, and lending the inspiration of his presence to\r\nall parts of the field.\"\r\n\r\nOf Zachary Taylor, our author writes, in his masterly way: \"The blaze of\r\nglory which is concentrated upon the name and life of Zachary Taylor,\r\nreveals a hero as true in metal, as sterling in virtue, as intrepid in\r\naction, and tender of heart, as ever lifted sword in the cause of honor\r\nor country. On him has fallen that most sacred mantle of renown, woven\r\nfrom the fabric of a people's confidence, and lovingly bestowed--not as\r\nupon a being of superior race to be worshipped, but because he was a\r\nleader from among themselves--truly of the people. He was honored with\r\ntheir fullest trust in his integrity, and with their largest faith in\r\nhis uprightness as a man. As Daniel Webster truly said, the best days\r\nof the Roman republic afforded no brighter example of a man, who,\r\nreceiving the plaudits of a grateful nation, and clothed in the highest\r\nauthority of state, reached that pinnacle by more honest means; who\r\ncould not be accused of the smallest intrigue or of pursuing any devious\r\nways to political advancement in order to gratify personal ambition. All\r\nthe circumstances of his rise and popularity, from the beginning of his\r\ncareer, when, amid blood and smoke, he made the heroic defence of Fort\r\nHarrison, to the wonderful battles of Palo Alto, Resaca, and Buena\r\nVista, and at last the attainment of the Presidential chair--all repel\r\nthe slightest suspicion of sinister motive, or a wish for individual\r\naggrandizement. The unwavering rule of his life--his guide in every\r\naction--was the simple watchword, 'duty.'\r\n\r\n\"As to his qualities of leadership, they shone out in high relief, from\r\nfirst to last. In the war of 1812, he was only a captain, yet at Fort\r\nHarrison he inspired the scanty garrison with a belief in his power, and\r\nthey gave him their devoted support. In the Florida campaign he\r\ncommanded only a brigade, yet he seemed to infuse into every soldier the\r\nmost courageous bravery. In the beginning of the war with Mexico, he\r\nmarched into action at the head of a single division, and when this\r\nforce afterwards swelled into an army, it did not prove too much for the\r\nresources of its commanding general. The frowning heights and barricaded\r\nstreets of Monterey, bristling with ten thousand Mexicans, did not daunt\r\nhim. What though he had only six thousand men with which to hold them in\r\nsiege? The assault was fearlessly made, the streets were stormed, the\r\nheights were carried, the city was won--and kept!\r\n\r\n\"The brilliant victory of Buena Vista, where five thousand Americans\r\nhurled back and repulsed a tumultuous Mexican horde of twenty thousand,\r\nonly reiterates the same marvelous story of superior leadership.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Fresh from these splendid achievements, he received the nomination for\r\nPresident over the names of Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, and General\r\nScott. It was a spontaneous expression of the people's confidence,\r\nunheralded and unsought. And when he was triumphantly elected over the\r\nDemocratic and Free-soil candidates--General Cass, Martin Van Buren, and\r\nCharles Francis Adams--he accepted the high office in a spirit of\r\nhumility and simple compliance with duty.\"\r\n\r\nIn the sketch of General U. S. Grant's life, our author has written with\r\na masterly hand the outlines of the grand career of his favorite\r\ngeneral, the salient points of which are given with a soldierly energy\r\nand dash befitting the theme. Thus the chapter commences:\r\n\r\n\"The occasion often creates the man, but the man who _masters_ the\r\noccasion is born, not made. Many are pushed to the surface, momentarily,\r\nby the pressure of events, and then subside into common levels; but he\r\nis the true commander during a crisis, who can wield the waves of\r\ndifficulty to advantage, and be a sure pilot amid the on-rush of events\r\nwhen they thicken and deepen into a prolonged struggle.\r\n\r\n\"When, during the late war, our country needed a leader to face and\r\nquell the threatened danger of disunion, and conduct her armies to\r\nsuccessful issues; and when Government entrusted those momentous issues\r\nto Ulysses S. Grant, 'the man and the moment had met,'--the occasion had\r\nfound its master.\r\n\r\n\"Napoleon said that the most desirable quality of a good general was\r\nthat his judgment should be in equilibrium with his courage. To no\r\ncommander of modern times could this rule apply with more force than to\r\nGrant. A man of no outward clamor of character, no hint of bluster or\r\ndash, quiet-voiced, self-controlled, but not self-asserting, he yet\r\ndisplayed vast power as an organizer, as a tactician, and in masterly\r\ncombinations of large forces so as to produce the most telling effects.\r\nIt has been truly said of him that no general ever stamped his own\r\npeculiar character upon an army more emphatically than did Grant upon\r\nthe Army of the Tennessee. It was the only large organization which, as\r\na whole, never suffered a defeat during the war. It was noted for its\r\nmarvelous persistence--its determined fighting qualities--and had the\r\nreputation of being sure to win any battle that lasted over a day, no\r\nmatter what the odds against it. It was at Grant's recommendation that a\r\nunited command was concentrated in the Mississippi Valley--which\r\nconcentration has since been acknowledged to have been the basis of all\r\nour subsequent victories.\r\n\r\n\"Generosity, mildness and kind-heartedness, shone as conspicuously in\r\nGrant's character as his firmness and great generalship. Simplicity of\r\nmanner and kindness of heart are always characteristic of the true hero.\r\n\r\n    'The bravest are the tenderest,\r\n    The loving are the daring.'\r\n\r\n\"The rapid and bold descent upon Fort Donelson, the unconquerable\r\ndetermination exhibited at Shiloh, the brilliant capture of Vicksburg,\r\nand the high military science displayed at Chattanooga Valley, Look-out\r\nMountain, and Missionary Ridge--these have never been surpassed in\r\nmilitary history, in splendor of execution, or judiciousness of\r\ncombination.\"...\r\n\r\nFor brevity and comprehensiveness we commend the following unique\r\nparagraph on the genealogy of his subject:\r\n\r\n\"The great-grandfather of Ulysses was Captain Noah Grant, who was killed\r\nat the battle of White Plains, during the French and Indian wars, in\r\n1776. His grandfather, Noah Grant, Jr., fought at Lexington as\r\nlieutenant of militia, and afterwards, during the Revolution. His\r\nfather, Jesse, emigrated from Pennsylvania to Ohio, and was married at\r\nPoint Pleasant, Ohio, June, 1821, to Hannah Simpson, whose father was\r\nalso from the Keystone State. Ulysses was born the following year, April\r\ntwenty-seventh, 1822.\"\r\n\r\nWe quote again from the sketch of Grant:\r\n\r\n\"On the sixth of February the brilliant reduction of Fort Henry, on the\r\nTennessee, was accomplished by Foote, and Fort Donelson, twelve miles\r\ndistant, was next in line. Grant and Foote were co-operating by land and\r\nwater; but Foote did not meet here with the same success that attended\r\nhim at Fort Henry. It was the fifteenth of February, and Grant had spent\r\ntwo or three days in making an investment of the high and wooded bluff\r\nfrom which frowned the guns of Donelson. Before daybreak, on the\r\nfifteenth, he had gone on board the flag-ship of Foote, in consultation\r\nas to the time and manner of attack, when the enemy swept from their\r\nworks and fell upon the Union lines with tremendous force. The fighting\r\nbecame furious at once, and for some time the battle-line swayed to and\r\nfro, between victory and defeat. It was desperate work; brigades and\r\nregiments were repulsed and by turns advanced--the brave commands\r\ndisputing every inch of the rocky and difficult battle-field. When Grant\r\nreached the scene it was 'to find his right thrown back, ammunition\r\nexhausted, and the ranks in confusion.' With quick inspiration he took\r\nin the situation at a glance, comprehended that the enemy had exhausted\r\nhis greatest strength, and ordered an immediate attack by the left on\r\nthe Confederate works in front. General Smith was in command of this\r\nportion of the army, and had not actively participated in the conflict.\r\nHe therefore brought fresh troops to the assault. McClernand was also\r\nordered to reform his shattered ranks and advance. The combined forces\r\ncharged with splendid valor up the rocky steeps, in the blaze of a\r\nwithering fire poured down upon them from the fort. They did not falter\r\nfor a single instant, but reaching the summit, swept over and into the\r\nConfederate works with ringing cheers. On the next morning a white flag\r\nwas seen flying from the fort, and under its protection, proposals for\r\nan armistice were sent in. Grant replied that unconditional surrender,\r\nand that immediately, must be made, or he would move on their works at\r\nonce. Thereupon, Buckner, who was in command, surrendered the fort with\r\nits thirteen thousand men. This splendid victory blazoned the name of\r\nGrant all over the country, and he immediately became the people's\r\nhero.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"His next achievement, the capture of Vicksburg, was wonderful indeed.\r\nIts natural strength of position on a high bluff, one hundred feet\r\nabove the water level, added to the formidable array of defences which\r\nbristled defiance to all foes, made Vicksburg a very citadel of power,\r\nand the fifty thousand men stationed there under Pemberton and Price did\r\nnot lessen the difficulties to be overcome. A fort, mounting eight guns,\r\nsentineled the approach to the city from beneath, while the heights\r\nabove were guarded by a three-banked battery. Eight miles of batteries\r\nlined the shore above and below Vicksburg. Grant made several fruitless\r\nattempts to get to the rear of the city by digging canals across the\r\nstrip of land on which it stood, and making an inland route; but each\r\none, after herculean labor, had been abandoned. He now decided on the\r\nbold enterprise of running the gauntlet of these batteries with his\r\ntransports. This desperate feat was successfully accomplished; but\r\nbefore he could land his troops at Grand Gulf, which he had selected as\r\nhis starting-point, it was necessary to run its batteries as he had\r\nthose of Vicksburg, land his troops farther down the river, and capture\r\nthe place by hard fighting. He waited for nothing. Hurrying forward the\r\nmoment he touched land, his object was to take Grand Gulf before the\r\nenemy could reinforce it.... After conquering Grand Gulf, where he\r\nexpected Banks to join him, he was confronted with the refusal of that\r\ngeneral to co-operate with him. In this dilemma nothing but a\r\nmaster-stroke of genius could wring success from the materials of\r\ndefeat. He saw what was before him, and with true inspiration became the\r\nmaster of circumstances. At the head of his brave command he pushed\r\ninland, aiming to crush the enemy 'in detail before he could concentrate\r\nhis forces.' By a rapid series of brilliant marches, battles and\r\nvictories, Grant had, at last, on the nineteenth of May, succeeded in\r\ncompletely investing Vicksburg. The whole plan from its outset was\r\nbrilliant to an extraordinary degree, and the tireless persistence and\r\nenergy shown in its accomplishment, stamped this man as a very Gibraltar\r\nof military genius.\r\n\r\n\"An assault on the enemy's works at first, had proven a failure, and now\r\nthe wonderful siege began. For forty-six days the digging and mining\r\nwent patiently forward, while screaming shells and booming shot produced\r\na reign of terror in the city, until at last, Pemberton could hold out\r\nno longer and surrendered his starving garrison to the superior prowess\r\nand strategy of Grant. It was the morning of the fourth of July when our\r\ntroops took possession of Vicksburg, and ran up the stars and stripes\r\nfrom the top of the court-house. The soldiers, standing beneath it, sang\r\n'Rally round the Flag,' and Grant became more than ever the popular\r\nhero. On the thirteenth of July, Lincoln wrote him a letter of 'grateful\r\nacknowledgment for the almost inestimable service' he had rendered the\r\ncountry. In September he was placed in command of the 'Departments of\r\nthe Ohio, of the Cumberland, and of the Tennessee, constituting the\r\nMilitary Division of the Mississippi.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Grant assumed the duties of his high office [the lieutenant-generalship\r\nof the army] without flourish of any sort, and proceeded to inaugurate\r\nthe successive steps of his last great campaign. The military resources\r\nwhich centered in his hand were stupendous, but had they fallen under\r\nthe control of a man less great than he, their very immensity would\r\nhave rendered them powerless. The splendid army of the Potomac was on\r\nthe move by May third, and the last march to Richmond had begun. Then\r\ncame the three-days' battle of the Wilderness, on the south bank of the\r\nRapidan, bloody and terrible and strange, during which some of our\r\ntroops were fighting continuously for forty-eight hours; and following\r\nclose after came also Spottsylvania, which was the result of an endeavor\r\nto cut off Lee's retreat. This, too, was a desperate conflict, where\r\nprecious blood flowed in rivers. Then followed the race between the two\r\nopposing armies, for the North Anna. After crossing this river, and\r\nfinding the Confederates occupying a fortified position on the South\r\nAnna, Grant 'swung his army around to the Pamunky, and pitched his\r\nhead-quarters at Hanover Court House,' These masterly flank movements,\r\nin which he manoeuvred his vast army with such ease, exhibited his\r\nmarvelous genius in stronger light than ever before. From the Pamunky he\r\nadvanced to the Chickahominy, and, after the battle of Cold Harbor, made\r\na rapid but quiet change of front on the night of the twelfth of June,\r\nand two days afterwards crossed the James and advanced against\r\nPetersburg and Richmond. The attack, at first a success, failed through\r\na blunder, not Grant's; and then began the long siege which ended at\r\nlast in the evacuation of Petersburg and Richmond. Nowhere was the joy\r\nmore heartfelt over these results than among the released captives of\r\nLibby Prison.\r\n\r\n\"Lee made a desperate endeavor to escape the 'manifest destiny' that\r\npursued him, and led his army a 'race for life.' But Grant, close on his\r\ntrack, environed him on all sides, and the surrender at Appomattox\r\nbecame inevitable. When, at the final scene, Lee presented his sword to\r\nGrant, the great general handed it back to him, saying, 'it could not be\r\nworn by a braver man.'\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe present the reader with the following extracts from the sketch of\r\nGeneral Sheridan. It will be observed that the author is extremely happy\r\nin the selection of his subjects, his aim evidently being to include\r\nthose only whose reputation for heroism is unquestioned and national.\r\n\r\n\"Sheridan is probably the most intense type of 'soldiership' brought to\r\nlight by the last war. Nor can any other war furnish an individual\r\nexample that will surpass him in fiery concentration. In battle he is\r\nthe very soul of vehement action--the incarnate wrath of the storm. No\r\nhistorian can ever portray the man so truly as did the remarkable\r\nvictory of Cedar Creek--a result solely of his extraordinary power. The\r\nmarvelous will-force with which he could hurl himself in the front of\r\nbattle, and infuse his own spirit of unconquerable daring into the\r\nranks, is phenomenal, to say the least.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"When Grant became Lieutenant-General, Sheridan was given the command of\r\nthe cavalry of the army of the Potomac, and all his subsequent movements\r\nevinced wonderful daring, skill and energy. No trust committed to his\r\ncharge was ever misplaced, no matter what its magnitude or importance.\r\n\r\n\"When the Confederate Generals Ewell and Early were sent into the\r\nShenandoah Valley, and went so far north as to threaten Washington,\r\nGrant consolidated the four military divisions of the Susquehanna,\r\nWashington, Monongahela and West Virginia, into the 'army of the\r\nShenandoah,' and placed Sheridan in command. He defeated Early at\r\nOpequan, September nineteenth--for which he was made brigadier-general\r\nof the United States army; defeated him again at Fisher's Hill on the\r\ntwenty-second, and on October the nineteenth occurred the battle of\r\nCedar Creek.\r\n\r\n\"The position of Sheridan's army at this time was along the crest of\r\nthree hills, 'each one a little back of the other,' The army of West\r\nVirginia, under Crook, held the first hill; the second was occupied by\r\nthe Nineteenth Corps, under Emory, and the Sixth Corps, with Torbet's\r\ncavalry covering its right flank, held the third elevation. Early,\r\nmarching his army in five columns, crossed the mountains and forded the\r\nnorth branch of the Shenandoah River, at midnight, on the eighteenth. He\r\nknew that Sheridan had gone up to Washington, and wanted to take\r\nadvantage of his absence to surprise the unsuspecting camp. The march\r\nwas conducted so noiselessly that, though he skirted the borders of our\r\nposition for miles, nothing came to the ears of our pickets, save in a\r\nfew instances where a heavy muffled tramp was heard, but disregarded as\r\nof no consequence.\r\n\r\n\"The gray gloom of early morning hovered over the camp, when a\r\nreconnoitring force from Crook's army was preparing to go out. Suddenly,\r\na wild yell burst through the fog which hid from view the Confederate\r\narmy. A withering musketry fire and the clash of arms quickly followed.\r\nBefore our surprised and panic-stricken troops could be formed in\r\nbattle-array, the enemy were upon them, and after a short and sharp\r\nencounter, the army of Western Virginia was thrown into utter rout--a\r\nmass of fugitives flying before the pursuing foe back towards the second\r\nhill where the Nineteenth Corps was encamped.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"The Nineteenth Corps attempted to arrest the Confederate advance, but\r\nthe enemy getting in our rear and enfilading us with our captured\r\nbatteries, the troops broke ranks and fell back in confusion towards the\r\nencampment of the Sixth Corps, on the third hill in the rear.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Sheridan, meantime, was at Winchester, where he had arrived the night\r\nbefore, intending to go on to Cedar Creek the next morning. As he sipped\r\nhis coffee at breakfast he did not for an instant dream of the terrible\r\nrout and disaster hovering at that moment over his army. When he rode\r\nout of Winchester the vibrations of the ground under the heavy\r\ndischarges of artillery in the distance gave the first intimations of\r\ndanger. But he was not yet alarmed, knowing the security of his\r\nposition. As he went onward, however, the thunder of the cannon\r\ndeepened, and then the terrible truth flashed upon him. He dashed spurs\r\ninto his horse and was soon tearing madly along the road, far ahead of\r\nhis escort.\r\n\r\n\"For five anxious hours the desperate struggle had gone on, when\r\nSheridan arrived on the field, encountering first the stream of\r\nfugitives surging northward. They turned about as they saw their\r\ninvincible leader flying towards the front, and even the wounded along\r\nthe roadside cheered him as he passed. Swinging his cap over his head,\r\nhe shouted: 'Face the other way, boys!--face the other way! We are going\r\nback to our camps! We are going to lick them out of their boots!'\r\n\r\n\"It was about ten o'clock when, with his horse covered with foam, he\r\ngalloped up to the front. Immediately, under his quick commands, the\r\nbroken ranks were reformed, and when the Confederates made their next\r\ngrand charge across the fields the terrific repulse that met and hurled\r\nthem back showed the turn of the tide, and compelled them to relinquish\r\nthe offensive. For two hours Sheridan rode back and forth along the\r\nline, seeming to be everywhere at once, infusing into the men his own\r\ndaring courage and enthusiasm. Shouts and cheers followed him; and\r\nthough the tired soldiers had been fighting for five long hours and had\r\neaten nothing since the night before, his presence was both food and\r\ninspiration, and everything seemed to be forgotten in an all-controlling\r\nimpulse to follow their glorious leader to victory.\r\n\r\n\"Early retired his troops a short distance after their repulse, and\r\nbegan throwing up breastworks. But the intrepid Sheridan had no notion\r\nof allowing him to retain that position. He meant to regain Cedar Creek\r\nand rout the enemy. At half-past three a bold charge was made. An awful\r\nmusketry and artillery fire was poured into the advancing Union columns,\r\nand, at first, the lines broke and fell back; but Sheridan rose at once\r\nto the needs of the crisis, and with superhuman efforts restored order\r\nand resumed the advance. Then came 'the long-drawn yell of our charge,'\r\nand 'everything on the first line, the stone walls, the tangled wood,\r\nthe advanced crest, and half-finished breastworks, had been carried.'\r\n\r\n\"The panic-stricken enemy was sent flying in utter rout through\r\nMiddletown, through Strasburg, through Fisher's Hill, and to Woodstock,\r\nsixteen miles beyond. Early was thus effectually driven out of the\r\nShenandoah Valley, and permanently crippled.\r\n\r\n\"This wonderful victory, due to Sheridan's personal presence alone, put\r\na crown on his head which few warriors could pluck from the heights of\r\nFame.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"On March the fourth, 1869, he received the promotion of\r\nlieutenant-general, and was appointed to the command of the Division of\r\nthe Missouri, of the Platte, and of Texas, with head-quarters at\r\nChicago.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe name of Kilpatrick kindles enthusiasm in the breast of every\r\ncavalryman of the late war, and our author, having served under him, has\r\nsketched his life, _con amore_, in vivid and thrilling language, and\r\nwith a keen appreciation of his great merits as a cavalry leader. The\r\nfollowing extract will confirm our view:\r\n\r\n\"Like the French Murat, Kilpatrick seems to have been born to become a\r\nvery demi-god of cavalry. Daringly heroic on the field, he displayed a\r\nsupreme genius for war, especially for that department of the service\r\nwhose alarum cry is, 'To horse!' and whose sweeping squadrons, with wild\r\nclatter of hoofs, seem to the fervid imagination to be making a race for\r\nglory, even though it be through the gates of death.\r\n\r\n\"It is quite in keeping with everything about Kilpatrick that he should\r\nchoose the cavalry as a vehicle for his high ambition and noble\r\npatriotism. Such energies as his could scarcely be content with less\r\ndash or less brilliance of action. The beginning of his war career was\r\none of romance, and his previous life indicated an unusual range of\r\nabilities. He first figures as the boy-orator, speaking in favor of a\r\nCongressional candidate, with all the fresh warmth and enthusiasm of his\r\nyoung nature. Then we see him as cadet at West Point, from which he\r\ngraduates fifteenth in his class and is given the honor of\r\nvaledictorian. The day of graduation is hastened a few months by the\r\nstartling guns of Sumter, which proclaim treason rampant, and fire all\r\nloyal breasts with a desire to rush to the rescue of their country's\r\nbeloved flag. The impatience and enthusiasm of Kilpatrick could not be\r\nrestrained, and through his influence a petition was signed by\r\nthirty-seven of his class to be allowed to graduate at once and go to\r\nthe front. The request was granted, and that day was one of especial\r\nsignificance at West Point. It was also one of equal significance in his\r\nlife; for the little chapel, where had rung out the words of his\r\nfarewell address, also witnessed the sacred ceremony of his marriage\r\nwith the lady of his love, and on that evening the young soldier and his\r\nbride took the train for Washington and the front. We know little of the\r\nbride except that she was enshrined in her husband's heart, and that her\r\nname--'Alice'--was inscribed on the silken banner under which he fought,\r\nand so gloriously led his troopers to victory and renown. No one can\r\ntell how much that name may have had to do with his future marvelous\r\nsuccess. To natures like his, the magic of a name thus loved, fluttering\r\naloft in the smoke of battle, becomes talismanic, and inspires almost\r\nsuperhuman heroism.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"When McDowell marched to Falmouth, he was once more at the front, and,\r\nin conjunction with Colonel Bayard and the First Pennsylvania Cavalry,\r\nmade a brilliant night-attack on Falmouth Heights, routing Lee's cavalry\r\nand capturing the place. For this dashing achievement Kilpatrick\r\nreceived the thanks of the commanding general. Afterwards, under Pope's\r\ncommand, he made his first famous raid in breaking up 'Stonewall'\r\nJackson's line of communication with Richmond from Gordonsville in the\r\nShenandoah Valley, over the Virginia Central Railway. At Beaver Dam,\r\nFrederick's Hall, and Hanover Junction, he burned the stations,\r\ndestroyed the tracks, and daringly attacked the enemy wherever he could\r\nfind him. These events took place during July and August, 1862, and the\r\nboldness of the operations, in the very heart of the enemy's country,\r\nfilled the North with Kilpatrick's fame....\r\n\r\n\"When Hooker was placed at the head of the Army of the Potomac, the\r\ncavalry was reorganized under Stoneman as chief, and that general, in\r\nthe following campaign, assigned to Kilpatrick the work of destroying\r\nthe railroad and bridges over the Chickahominy. Four hundred and fifty\r\nmen were given him for the work; but with this small force he brought to\r\nthe difficult mission his usual skill, and, avoiding large forces of the\r\nenemy, raided to within two miles of Richmond, where he captured\r\n'Lieutenant Brown, aide-de-camp to General Winder, and eleven men within\r\nthe fortifications.' He says: 'I then passed down to the left to the\r\nMeadow Bridge on the Chickahominy, which I burned, ran a train of cars\r\ninto the river, retired to Hanover-town on the Peninsula, crossed just\r\nin time to check the advance of a pursuing cavalry force, burned a train\r\nof thirty wagons loaded with bacon, captured thirteen prisoners, and\r\nencamped for the night five miles from the river,' This was the manner\r\nof his conquering quest, until on the seventh he again struck the Union\r\nlines at Gloucester Point, having made a march of about 'two hundred\r\nmiles in less than five days, and captured and paroled over eight\r\nhundred prisoners.' In the accomplishment of this splendid feat he lost\r\nonly one officer and thirty-seven men.\r\n\r\n\"At Chancellorsville, when Lee came into Maryland and massed his cavalry\r\nat Beverly Ford, Pleasonton was sent forward on a reconnaissance, and\r\nmet the enemy in battle at Brandy Station. This is renowned as the\r\ngreatest cavalry battle of the war. General Gregg arrived upon the field\r\nat half-past ten in the morning, and though his noble squadrons fought\r\nwell and bravely, these columns were rolled back, and for a moment, all\r\nseemed lost, and overwhelmed by the superior numbers of the foe. But at\r\nthis crisis, Kilpatrick, posted on a slight rise of ground, unrolled his\r\nbattle-flag to the breeze, and his bugles sounded the charge. He had\r\nunder his command, the Harris Light, Tenth New York, and First Maine.\r\nThe formation for an onset was quickly made, and the disciplined\r\nsquadrons of these three regiments were hurled upon the enemy. But the\r\nTenth New York recoiled before the murderous fire of the enemy's\r\ncarbines. So did the Harris Light. Kilpatrick was maddened at the sight.\r\nHe rushed to the head of the First Maine regiment, shouting, 'Men of\r\nMaine, you must save the day!' Under the impulse of this enthusiasm,\r\nthey became altogether resistless, and in conjunction with the reformed\r\nsquadrons of the two other regiments, swept the enemy before them, and\r\nplucked victory, with glorious valor, from the very jaws of defeat. On\r\nthe next day Kilpatrick was made brigadier-general.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving presented extracts from \"Heroes of Three Wars,\" and ventured to\r\nexpress, incidentally and briefly our own humble opinion of the merits\r\nof this work, we will now, in confirmation of our judgment, give some\r\nreviews of the Press--a few out of many. Throughout the North the work\r\nwas hailed with not a little enthusiasm, by soldiers and civilians\r\nalike--as a work of decided literary merit, and one written in a fair,\r\ntruthful, and loyal spirit, replete with much valuable historical\r\ninformation of a character not otherwise easily attainable, and\r\ncalculated to accomplish much good among the rising generation.\r\n\r\nThe Boston _Transcript_ says:\r\n\r\n     \"The bivouac, the march, the hand-to-hand conflict with bristling\r\n     steel, the head-long charge, the ignominious retreat, and the\r\n     battle-field after the bloody assault, with its dead and wounded\r\n     heroes, are all excellently portrayed, and with an ease and vigor\r\n     of style that lend a peculiar charm to the book, and rivet the\r\n     attention of the reader from cover to cover. It is really\r\n     refreshing to meet with such a work as this in these degenerate\r\n     days of namby-pamby novels, so enervating to mind and morals.\r\n     Captain Glazier's work elevates the ideas, and infuses a spirit of\r\n     commendable patriotism into the young mind, by showing the youth of\r\n     the country how nobly men could die for the principles they\r\n     cherished and the land they loved.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chicago _Inter-Ocean_ writes as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"It is correct in facts, graphic in its delineations, and in all\r\n     its makeup is a most admirable volume. It will do the young men,\r\n     and even those older, good to glance at these pages and read anew\r\n     the perils and hardships and sacrifices which have been made by the\r\n     loyal men who met and overthrew in battle the nation's enemies.\r\n     The book is of absorbing interest as a record of brave deeds by as\r\n     brave and heroic men as ever answered a bugle's call. The author\r\n     writes no fancy sketch. He has the smoke and scars of battle in\r\n     every sentence. He answered roll-call and mingled amid the exciting\r\n     events he relates. No writer, even the most praised correspondents\r\n     of the foreign journals, have given more vivid descriptions\r\n     soul-stirring in their simple truthfulness, than Captain Glazier in\r\n     his 'Heroes of Three Wars.'\"\r\n\r\nThe Baltimore _Sun_ writes:\r\n\r\n     \"'Heroes of Three Wars' is written by the masterly hand of one who\r\n     has evidently enjoyed a personal acquaintance with many of the\r\n     subjects introduced, and is not only thoroughly imbued with the\r\n     spirit of his work, but as thoroughly inspires his readers. Captain\r\n     Glazier has familiarized himself with all of the details of\r\n     interest in the lives of a grand galaxy of heroes, and has put on\r\n     paper, in a condensed and graphic form, a clear picture of what he\r\n     has treasured up in his own mind. We know of no book that contains\r\n     so faithful a presentation of our brave defenders in so condensed\r\n     and satisfactory a form.\"\r\n\r\nThe Philadelphia _Times_ observes:\r\n\r\n     \"The soldier-author does his work in an artless, patriotic,\r\n     beautiful style, and gives to his readers a real and not an\r\n     imaginary idea of army life in all its lights and shades. Captain\r\n     Glazier has laid his countrymen under lasting obligations to him,\r\n     especially in this new book, 'Heroes of Three Wars.'\"\r\n\r\nThe Cincinnati _Enquirer_ remarks:\r\n\r\n     \"Captain Glazier rises above the conventional war-writers' idioms,\r\n     and gives his work a place in literature and history. Here is found\r\n     the stern actuality of war's fearful tug; here the beautiful pathos\r\n     of pure manly sentiment flowing from the heart of many a brave soul\r\n     on the battle's eve; here the scenes of sad and solemn burial where\r\n     warriors weep. The din of battle on one page, and the jest at the\r\n     peril past on the next--the life-test and the comedy of camp--these\r\n     alternatingly checker the work over, and give the reader a truer\r\n     insight into the perils and privations of our brave defenders than\r\n     any book we have read.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nOCEAN TO OCEAN ON HORSEBACK.\r\n\r\n\r\n  From Boston to San Francisco.--An unparalleled ride.--Object of the\r\n    journey.--Novel lecture tour.--Captain Frank M.

Kelly.--A success.--Proceeds of lecture.--Edward F.\r\n    Rollins.--Extracts from first lecture.--Press notices.\r\n\r\nThe story of the career of Willard Glazier will not be complete without\r\nsome description of his novel and adventurous feat of riding on\r\nhorseback across the continent of North America--literally from ocean to\r\nocean, or from Boston to San Francisco. This unparalleled ride was\r\nsatisfactorily accomplished by him in 1876--the Centennial year. It was\r\na long and trying journey, extending over a period of two hundred days,\r\nand a distance of four thousand one hundred and thirty-three miles, but\r\nat the same time a journey of great interest. His object was to study,\r\nat comparative leisure, the line of country through which he would pass,\r\nand to note the habits and condition of the people he came in contact\r\nwith. The knowledge thus laboriously acquired he purposed placing before\r\nthe public in book form.\r\n\r\nWhile thus in the commendable pursuit of knowledge, he also contemplated\r\nmaking some practical return for the many kindnesses and courtesies he\r\nhad received at the hands of soldiers since the disbandment of the\r\nvolunteer army, and the wide circulation of the first product of his\r\npen, _The Capture, Prison-Pen and Escape_; and it had occurred to him\r\nthat to accomplish this he might turn his journey to beneficial account\r\nby lecturing at the various towns he visited, and handing over the\r\nproceeds to the Widows' and Orphans' fund of the \"Grand Army of the\r\nRepublic,\" of which patriotic society he was a member; or to some other\r\nbenevolent military organization.\r\n\r\nThe thought no sooner entered his mind than, with his usual promptitude,\r\nthe resolution was formed, and, with the following letter of\r\nintroduction from Captain Frank M. Clark, of New York, he at once\r\nproceeded to Boston:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 4 Irving Place,\r\n                                         New York, _April 20, 1876._\r\n\r\n     To Comrades of the G. A. R.:\r\n\r\n     I have been intimately acquainted with Captain Willard Glazier, a\r\n     comrade in good standing of Post No. 29, Department of New York,\r\n     \"Grand Army of the Republic,\" for the past eight years, and know\r\n     him to be worthy the confidence of every loyal man. He is an\r\n     intelligent and courteous gentleman, an author of good repute, a\r\n     soldier whose record is without a stain, and a true comrade of the\r\n     \"Grand Army.\" I bespeak for him the earnest and cordial support of\r\n     all comrades of the Order.\r\n\r\n                                    Yours very truly in F., C. and L.,\r\n                                                   Frank M. Clark,\r\n                        Late A. A. G. Department of New York, G. A. R.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Captain Glazier At Tremont Temple, Boston.]\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the eighth of May, 1876, Captain Glazier lectured as\r\narranged at Tremont Temple, Boston. His subject, appropriate to the\r\nCentennial year, was entitled \"Echoes from the Revolution.\" This was the\r\nfirst occasion of any importance on which he had ever appeared on the\r\nrostrum. It may here be mentioned that his friends strongly recommended\r\nhim to deliver the first lecture before a smaller and less critical\r\naudience than he would be likely to confront in Boston, and thus\r\nprepare himself for a later appearance in the literary capital; but our\r\nsoldier reasoned that as lecturing was a new experience to him, his\r\nmilitary education dictated that, if he could carry the strongest works\r\nthe weaker along the line would fall, as a matter of course, and so\r\nresolved to deliver his first lecture in Tremont Temple. The lecture, as\r\nwe have said, had been prepared with a view to its delivery at various\r\ntowns and cities on the route he contemplated traveling. He was\r\nintroduced to his Boston audience by Captain Theodore L. Kelly,\r\nCommander of Post 15, Grand Army of the Republic, and was honored by the\r\npresence on the platform of representatives from nearly all the Posts of\r\nBoston. Captain Kelly introduced his comrade in the following\r\ncomplimentary manner:\r\n\r\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen: It gives me pleasure to have the honor of\r\nintroducing to you one who, by his services in the field and by the\r\nworks of his pen, is entitled to your consideration, and the confidence\r\nof the comrades of the 'Grand Army of the Republic.' I desire to say\r\nthat he comes well accredited, furnished with the proper vouchers and\r\ndocuments, and highly endorsed and recommended by the officers of the\r\nDepartment of the State of New York. Though young in years, his life has\r\nbeen one of varied and exciting experience. Born in the wilds of St.\r\nLawrence County, New York, his education was drawn from the great book\r\nof nature; and from his surroundings he early imbibed a love of liberty.\r\nHis early associations naturally invested him with a love of adventure\r\nand excitement, and when the call of war was heard he at once responded,\r\nand enlisted in the Harris Light Cavalry, with which corps he passed\r\nthrough many exciting scenes of march and fray. His experience amid the\r\nvarious vicissitudes of the war, in camp and field and prison, have been\r\nvividly portrayed by his pen in his various publications. Still inspired\r\nby this love of adventure, he proposes to undertake the novelty of a\r\njourney across the continent in the saddle. His objects are manifold.\r\nWhile visiting scenes and becoming more familiar with his own country,\r\nhe will collect facts and information for a new book, and at his various\r\nstopping-places he will lecture under the auspices and for the benefit\r\nof the 'Grand Army of the Republic,' to whose fraternal regard he is\r\nmost warmly commended. Allow me then, ladies and gentlemen, without\r\nfurther ceremony, to present to you the soldier-author, and our comrade,\r\nWillard Glazier.\"\r\n\r\nThe lecture proved a success both financially and in the marked pleasure\r\nwith which it was received by a very select audience. In fulfillment of\r\nhis generous purpose in the application of the proceeds, Glazier on the\r\nsucceeding morning addressed a letter to the Assistant Adjutant-General,\r\nDepartment of Massachusetts, Grand Army of the Republic, in the\r\nfollowing words:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       Revere House,\r\n                                              Boston, _May 9th, 1876_.\r\n\r\n     Captain Charles W. Thompson,\r\n        A. A. G. Department of Massachusetts, G. A. R.\r\n\r\n     Comrade: I take pleasure in handing you the net proceeds of my\r\n     lecture delivered at Tremont Temple last night, which I desire to\r\n     be divided equally between Posts 7 and 15, G. A. R., of Boston, for\r\n     the benefit of our disabled comrades, and the needy and destitute\r\n     wards of the \"Grand Army.\" Gratefully acknowledging many favors and\r\n     courtesies extended to me in your patriotic city,\r\n\r\n                                          I am yours in F., C. and L.,\r\n                                                       Willard Glazier.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this the following response was received:\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Headquarters, Encampment John A.

James Mclean.\r\n                     William S. Wallingford.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding with our account of the journey, let us dwell for a\r\nmoment upon the features of the lecture prepared by Willard Glazier for\r\ndelivery at Boston. As might have been expected, it was a\r\nmilitary-historical lecture, adapted to the understanding and taste of a\r\nmixed and educated audience, and was written in the same earnest,\r\noriginal, patriotic and rousing style that characterizes his writings\r\nthroughout. Some parts of this lecture, in our opinion, are worthy of\r\ncomparison with the oratorical deliverances of eminent and practised\r\nlecturers, and that the reader may judge for himself if the \"Echoes of\r\nthe Revolution\" lose aught of their sonorousness at this distant date,\r\nwhen the reverberation reaches them through a lecture, we here present\r\nan abstract of the opening:\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY.\r\n\r\n\"The year 1876 re-echoes the scenes and events of a hundred years ago.\r\nIn imagination we make a pilgrimage back to the Revolution. We visit the\r\nfields whereon our ancestors fought for liberty and a Republic. We\r\nfollow patriots from Lexington to Yorktown. I see them walking through a\r\nbaptism of blood and of fire; their only purpose liberty; their only\r\nincentive duty; their only pride their country; and their only ambition\r\nvictory. I see them with Warren and Prescott at Bunker Hill; I see them\r\nwith Washington at Valley Forge, hatless, without shoes, half-clad, and\r\noften without food; encamped in fields of snow; patiently enduring the\r\nrigors of a northern winter. I see them pushing their way through the\r\nice of the Delaware. I see them at Saratoga, at Bennington, at\r\nPrinceton, and at Monmouth. I follow Marion and his daring troopers\r\nthrough the swamps of Georgia and the Carolinas. And, finally, we come\r\nto that immortal day at Yorktown, when Cornwallis surrendered his sword\r\nand command to George Washington.\r\n\r\n\"All the world is familiar with the causes which led to the struggle for\r\nindependence in America. We all know the spirit which animated the\r\npeople of the Colonies, from the seizure of Sir Edmond Andross in 1688\r\nto the destruction of the tea in Boston harbor in 1774. No American is\r\nignorant of the efforts of John Hancock, Samuel Adams, Joseph Warren,\r\nPatrick Henry, Alexander Hamilton, Paul Revere, and others, at clubs, in\r\nnewspapers, in pulpits, in the streets, and in coffee-houses, to guide\r\nand prepare the people for the approaching crisis. All the facts from\r\nthe beginning to the close of that memorable conflict are given in\r\nschool-books, as well as in more pretentious history. But the immediate\r\ncause of the march of the English troops from Boston to Concord seems to\r\nbe necessary to a comprehensive view of the subject.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"On the nineteenth of April, 1775, a handful of the yeomanry of\r\nMassachusetts, obeying a common impulse, came hurriedly together,\r\nconfronted a force of English regulars outnumbering them ten to one,\r\nreceived their fire, were repulsed, and left eighteen of their number\r\ndead and wounded on the green in front of Lexington. On the same day, at\r\nConcord, less than four hundred undisciplined militia met a regiment of\r\nthe enemy, fired upon them, put them to flight, and compelled them to\r\nretire to their intrenchments at Boston. It was the first step in that\r\nwar which gave us a Republic, and may be classed in history as one of\r\nthe decisive conflicts of modern times.\r\n\r\n\"Lexington and Concord were not the great battles of the Revolution;\r\nthey were, in fact, only skirmishes as compared with the more sanguinary\r\nactions; but I dwell upon them as the opening scenes, the\r\nstarting-points, where the first shots were fired in an eight years' war\r\nagainst British rule and British oppression in America....\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN STARK.\r\n\r\n\"Despair was turned into joy by the telling victories of the Americans\r\nat Trenton and Princeton, and the country began to see that her precious\r\nblood had not been spilled in vain. Just at this juncture of affairs,\r\nwhen it was necessary to follow up the tide of victory with vigorous\r\nwork, the term of enlistment of most of the men expired, and the\r\npersonal popularity and influence of the leaders was thus put to the\r\ntest. Would the men go, or could they be induced to stay through another\r\nterm of enlistment before seeking the respite they desired at their\r\nhomes? At this critical period, John Stark made an earnest appeal to his\r\nregiment, and every man without exception re-enlisted for six weeks\r\nunder the banner of their beloved leader. Then Stark went to New\r\nHampshire for recruits, and hundreds flocked around his standard.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Soon after the surrender of Cornwallis, General Stark returned once\r\nmore to his home and farm. He had served his country long and\r\nfaithfully, and retired from his protracted period of active service\r\nbeloved by the people and full of honors. He lived to be ninety-four\r\nyears old, and consequently witnessed the war of 1812.\r\n\r\n\"He sleeps on the banks of the Merrimac, nor heeds the noisy rush of the\r\nriver as it speeds on its mission to the sea. No clash of musketry, no\r\nroar of cannon will ever waken him more from his last deep repose. Men\r\ncall it death, but if it be death, it is that of the body only, for his\r\n_memory_ still lives and speaks to us across the years. It bids us be\r\nnoble and unselfish, and high of purpose, and grand of aim. Will the\r\noncoming generations who con the story of the life of John Stark listen\r\nto the preaching of such an example in vain?\r\n\r\n\r\nPERORATION.\r\n\r\n\"The surrender of Cornwallis may be considered the closing scene in the\r\nwar of the Revolution. The grim spectre of British rule over the\r\nAmerican Colonies vanished like the smoke of battle, while hirelings\r\nwere trembling and the patriot was prince. That was indeed a day of\r\ntriumph--a day of rejoicing. It was to the patriots the crown of all\r\ntheir efforts. A long, loud, thrilling shout of joy arose from the\r\nvictorious band of Washington, and as the tidings of actual surrender\r\nwere borne throughout the country, the people everywhere broke forth in\r\nwild huzzahs that echoed and re-echoed along the plains and among the\r\nhills, from the lakes to the gulf, and from the Atlantic to the\r\nmountains. There was joy because there was to be no more needless\r\nsacrifice of life; because the soldier could now exchange the camp for\r\nhis home; the implements of war for the implements of industry; the\r\ncarnage of battle for the amenities of peace.\r\n\r\n\"The work for which they buckled on the armor was accomplished. They did\r\nnot rush to arms for the love of glory, nor to ward off an imaginary\r\nfoe. They came at their country's call, and having achieved her\r\nindependence, they were now ready for the pursuits of peace. They even\r\nlonged for the coveted seclusion of their homes, and the sweet security\r\nof their firesides. I see them now marshaled for the last time to\r\nreceive an honorable discharge from a long campaign, the ensigns of\r\nvictory everywhere above them, the air vocal with the benedictions of a\r\ngrateful people. But on that great day of final discharge, at the last\r\nroll-call, the heroes were not all there to answer to their names; there\r\nwere vacant places in the ranks. In the marching and counter-marching,\r\nin the assault and in the defence; in the swamp and in the prison, mid\r\nthe fever and the pestilence, the patriots faltered not, but fell as\r\nfalls the hero, nobly daring, bravely dying, and though dead they are\r\nnot forgotten: their works do follow, and will forever live, after\r\nthem....\r\n\r\n\"Justice to our heroic ancestors does not forbid reference to the\r\nequally gallant 'Boys in Blue,' who by their invincible valor on the\r\nbattle-fields of the Rebellion preserved the unity of the Republic.\r\n\r\n\"The fight is done, and away in the far horizon the glorious days are\r\nwaxing dim. Even now, it is the bearded men who speak of Gettysburg; and\r\nchildren clasp the knees that marched to Corinth and Chickamauga. Year\r\nafter year our soldiers meet to talk of glory; and year by year their\r\nranks grow thinner, older, grayer; and, by and by, the last survivors of\r\nthe war for the Union will sleep with their brothers who fell at Bunker\r\nHill.\"\r\n\r\nThe press of Boston were highly commendatory in their notices of the\r\nlecture and its delivery, as will be seen by the following extract from\r\nthe _Globe_:\r\n\r\n     \"A very fair audience, considering the unfair condition of the\r\n     elements, was gathered in Tremont Temple last night, to hear\r\n     Captain Glazier's lecture upon 'Echoes from the Revolution.' The\r\n     frequent applause of the audience evinced not only a sympathy with\r\n     the subject, but an evident liking of the manner in which it was\r\n     delivered. The lecture itself was a retrospective view of the\r\n     leading incidents of the Revolution. It would have been unfair to\r\n     expect to hear anything very new upon a subject with which the\r\n     veriest school-boy is familiar; but Captain Glazier wove the events\r\n     together in a manner which freed the lecture from that most\r\n     unpardonable of all faults, which can be committed upon the\r\n     platform--dulness. He passed over, in his consideration of the\r\n     Revolution, the old scenes up to the time when Cornwallis\r\n     surrendered up his sword and command to George Washington. 'The\r\n     year 1876,' said Captain Glazier, 're-echoes the scenes and events\r\n     of a hundred years ago. In imagination we make a pilgrimage back to\r\n     the Revolution. We visit the fields whereon our ancestors fought\r\n     for liberty and a republic. We follow patriots from Lexington to\r\n     Yorktown. I see them pushing their way through the ice of the\r\n     Delaware--I see them at Saratoga, at Bennington, at Princeton, and\r\n     at Monmouth. I follow Marion and his daring troopers through the\r\n     swamps of Georgia and the Carolinas;' and in following them up, the\r\n     lecturer interspersed his exciting narrative with sundry droll\r\n     episodes. Treating of the battles of Trenton and Princeton, he\r\n     expatiated upon the devoted heroism of John Stark, and briefly\r\n     traced his career until, at Bennington, Burgoyne's victor announced\r\n     to his comrades, 'We must conquer to-day, my boys, or to-night\r\n     Molly Stark's a widow.' One battle after another was handled by the\r\n     lecturer in a pleasing manner, showing that he was thoroughly\r\n     familiar with the subject he had chosen for his theme. After\r\n     speaking in a most zealous manner of the troops on land, Captain\r\n     Glazier remarked: 'Our victories on the ocean during the war of the\r\n     Revolution were not less decisive and glorious than those achieved\r\n     on land. John Paul Jones and the gallant tars who, under his\r\n     leadership, braved the dangers of the deep, and wrested from proud\r\n     Britain, once queen of the sea, that illustrious motto which may be\r\n     seen high on our banner beside the stars and stripes.'\r\n\r\n     \"Captain Glazier made special mention of the naval engagement\r\n     between the Bon Homme Richard and the British man-of-war Serapis,\r\n     which took place in September, 1789. He described in glowing words\r\n     the fierce nature of that memorable contest, until the captain of\r\n     the Serapis, with his own hand, struck the flag of England to the\r\n     free stars and stripes of young America. Captain Glazier has\r\n     elements in him which, carefully matured and nurtured, will make\r\n     him successful on the platform, as he has already proved himself in\r\n     the fields of literature. He has a strong and melodious voice, a\r\n     gentlemanly address, and unassuming confidence. He was presented to\r\n     the audience by Commandant Kelly, of Post 15, 'Grand Army of the\r\n     Republic,' in a brief but eloquent speech. Captain Glazier will\r\n     start on his long ride to San Francisco, from the Revere House,\r\n     this morning, at 9.30, and will be accompanied to Bunker Hill and\r\n     thence to Brighton, by several distinguished members of the 'Grand\r\n     Army,' and other gentlemen, who wish the captain success on his\r\n     long journey.\"\r\n\r\nThe Boston _Post_ said:\r\n\r\n     \"The lecturer spoke with a soldier's enthusiasm of those stirring\r\n     times. In a very eloquent manner he traced the movements of the\r\n     Revolutionary heroes from that day in April, 1775, when the\r\n     undisciplined militia at Concord put the red-coats to flight and\r\n     forced them to retire to their entrenchments at Boston, onward\r\n     through the various battles to the surrender of Cornwallis. The\r\n     different acts passed in rapid succession before the audience, and\r\n     were enlivened with interesting details. In touching upon the\r\n     different battles, the lecturer descanted upon the more eminent\r\n     individuals whom the fate of war and opportunity brought to the\r\n     front, and enshrined forever in the gallery of patriots. Bunker\r\n     Hill came in for especial notice, where 'many brave and noble men\r\n     gave up their lives.'...\r\n\r\n     \"Captain Glazier was frequently and loudly applauded during the\r\n     delivery of his lecture. His voice is rich and powerful, his\r\n     intonation accurate, and his general manner could not help\r\n     imparting interest to the stirring deeds which he so graphically\r\n     delineated.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM BOSTON TO CHICAGO.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In the saddle.--Bunker Hill.--Arrives in\r\n    Albany.--Reminiscences.--The Soldiers' Home.--Contributions for\r\n    erecting Soldiers' Home.--Reception at\r\n    Rochester.--Buffalo.--Dunkirk.--Swanville.--Cleveland.--Massacre\r\n    of General Custer.--Monroe.--Lectures for Custer\r\n    Monument.--Father of General Custer.--Detroit.--Kalamazoo.--An\r\n    adventure.--Gives \"Paul Revere\" a\r\n    rest.--Decatur.--Niles.--Michigan City.--Chicago.\r\n\r\nFrom a journal kept by Captain Glazier during his horseback ride from\r\nocean to ocean, we shall gather most of the incidents of his journey--a\r\njourney, so far as we are aware, without any precedent, and having for\r\nits sole object the acquirement of knowledge. His intention was to\r\nlecture in the leading cities and villages through which he passed, in\r\nthe interest of the relief fund of the \"Grand Army of the Republic,\" to\r\nwhich order he was greatly attached.\r\n\r\nThe Boston _Globe_ of May ninth, 1876, contained the following brief\r\nnotice:\r\n\r\n     \"Boston to San Francisco.--Captain Willard Glazier started from the\r\n     Revere House this morning at eleven o'clock, on horseback, for San\r\n     Francisco. Quite a gathering of his friends and comrades of the\r\n     'Grand Army' were present to wish him God-speed. He was escorted by\r\n     Colonel John F. Finley and E. A. Williston, who were mounted; and\r\n     Adjutant-General Charles W. Thompson, Department of Massachusetts,\r\n     'G. A. R.;' Commander Theo. L. Kelly, of Post 15; Adjutant Grafton\r\n     Fenno, of Post 7, and many others in carriages, who will accompany\r\n     him to Bunker Hill and thence to Brighton.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ocean To Ocean On Horseback--riding Out Of Boston.]\r\n\r\nThe Captain's horse, which he had named \"Paul Revere,\" was a noble\r\ncreature, black as jet, of good pedigree, and possessing, in no slight\r\nmeasure, the sterling qualities of endurance, pace, and fidelity, albeit\r\noccasionally somewhat restive and wilful.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the \"Revere,\" the party referred to in the above notice\r\nproceeded to Bunker Hill, gazed reverentially at the monument\r\ncommemorating the famous battle, and then headed for Brighton. The short\r\njourney had been rendered comfortless by a continuous downfall of rain,\r\nand when the friends halted at the Cattle-Fair Hotel for dinner, they\r\nwere all more or less drenched to the skin.\r\n\r\nMuch cordial interest was manifested in the work the captain had\r\nundertaken and the motives that actuated him; and at length, taking\r\nleave of his friendly escort, he pushed forward through Worcester,\r\nSpringfield, Pittsfield, Nassau, and on to Albany, covering a distance\r\nof two hundred miles. At Beckett he found \"Paul's\" back becoming sore,\r\nand as a good rider is always humane to his horse, he removed the\r\nsaddle, washed the abrasion with cold water, and before resuming his\r\njourney put a blanket under the saddle-cloth, which kindly care afforded\r\n\"Paul\" considerable relief. At Pittsfield, Glazier delivered his fourth\r\nlecture in the Academy of Music, being introduced to his audience by\r\nCaptain Brewster, Commander of the Pittsfield Post, \"Grand Army of the\r\nRepublic.\"\r\n\r\nHis journey from Pittsfield was by the Boston and Albany Turnpike, over\r\nthe Pittsfield Mountain, passing the residence of Honorable Samuel J.\r\nTilden, then Governor of New York, and a candidate for the Presidency.\r\nStarting from Nassau at eleven o'clock, he reached the old Barringer\r\nHomestead soon after. It was with this family that he had spent his\r\nfirst night in Rensselaer County, sixteen years before, when looking for\r\na school to teach, and he could not resist the temptation to stop a few\r\nminutes at Brockway's, where he had boarded the first week after\r\nentering the school at Schodack Centre as a teacher. At the hotel he\r\nfound Mrs. Lewis, the landlady, awaiting his approach, as she had been\r\ntold he would pass that way. He also halted for a moment at his old\r\nschool-house, where he found Miss Libby Brockway, one of the youngest of\r\nhis old scholars, teaching the school. \"Thoughts of Rip Van Winkle,\" he\r\nsays, \"flitted across my imagination as I contrasted the past with the\r\npresent.\"\r\n\r\nOn the eighteenth of May Captain Glazier reached the fine old city of\r\nAlbany, capital of his native State, and in the evening of the same day\r\ndelivered his fifth lecture at Tweddle Hall.\r\n\r\nThrilling memories awaited him in Albany. Here, in 1859, he entered the\r\nState Normal School. It was here his patriotism was aroused by\r\nintelligence of the firing upon Fort Sumter, and he at once formed the\r\nresolution to enter the army in defence of the Union; and it was in\r\nAlbany that the first edition of his first book saw the light through\r\nthe press of Joel Munsell, in the autumn of 1865. Here, it may be said,\r\nhis career in life commenced, when, leaving his country home in Northern\r\nNew York, he entered the Normal School.\r\n\r\nThe erection of a Soldiers' Home having been recently projected, Glazier\r\ncalled on the adjutant-general at the State House, in relation to his\r\nlecturing in the interest of the fund for that purpose. Colonel Taylor,\r\nassistant adjutant-general, whom he had known for some years, presented\r\nhim to General Townsend, and he was recommended to see and consult with\r\nCaptain John Palmer, Past Grand Commander of the State, G. A. R.\r\n\r\nNothing can better prove the disinterested motives and objects of\r\nWillard Glazier in undertaking his long and tedious journey on\r\nhorseback, than the numerous voluntary offerings he made to certain\r\nmilitary organizations whose claims so forcibly presented themselves to\r\nhim. This was simply characteristic of him. He has never valued money\r\nbut for the practical uses to which it may be applied in the\r\namelioration of the condition of others. Simple in his habits, and\r\nunostentatious in his mode of life--indulging in no luxuries--he has\r\nmanaged by sheer hard work to accumulate a fair fortune, which is of\r\nvalue to him only so far as he can do good with it--first to those\r\nhaving the strongest domestic claims upon him, and secondly, to his\r\ncomrades of the camp and the battle-field.\r\n\r\nThe following letters will explain themselves:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       Delavan House,\r\n                                              Albany, _May 28th, 1876_.\r\n\r\n     Captain John Palmer, Past Grand Commander,\r\n        Department of New York, G. A. R.\r\n\r\n     Dear Sir and Comrade: I feel great pleasure in handing you\r\n     herewith, forty dollars, which I wish to be applied to the fund for\r\n     the erection of a Soldiers' Home, as lately proposed by our\r\n     comrades at Brooklyn. Should it be your pleasure to endorse my\r\n     lecture tour across the State, I feel confident that I could raise\r\n     from five hundred to a thousand dollars for this most worthy\r\n     object. Pledging my best efforts in the work, which I hope I need\r\n     scarcely add, enlists my warmest sympathies, I have the honor to\r\n     remain,\r\n\r\n                                        Yours in F., C. and L.,\r\n                                                      Willard Glazier.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Palmer, in acknowledging the donation, wrote as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  Headquarters Department of New York,\r\n                                       \"Grand Army of the Republic,\"\r\n                                            Albany, _May 31st, 1876_.\r\n\r\n     Captain Willard Glazier:\r\n\r\n     Comrade: Your gift of forty dollars to the fund for the erection of\r\n     the \"Soldiers' Home\" is duly received, and the same has been\r\n     forwarded to Captain E. O. Parkinson, Chairman Soldiers' Home\r\n     Committee, Brooklyn, New York, for which accept my thanks.\r\n\r\n                            Very truly yours, in F., C. and L.,\r\n                                                         John Palmer,\r\n                                                  Department Commander.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-second of May, \"'Paul' being in good condition and the\r\nbest of spirits,\" our soldier-author started for Schenectady, paying his\r\nrespects to Captain Palmer on his way up Washington Avenue. Schenectady\r\nwas reached at four o'clock P. M. through frequent showers of rain.\r\nPutting up at Gwinn's Hotel he delivered his lecture at Union Hall at\r\nthe usual hour in the evening, to a fair audience, notwithstanding the\r\nrain.\r\n\r\nThe Schenectady _Union_ had heralded his approach by the following\r\nnotice:\r\n\r\n     \"Captain Glazier.--This noted soldier, author, rider, and raider,\r\n     who raided during the war with General Kilpatrick, will advance\r\n     upon this place next Monday, and in the evening lecture upon\r\n     'Echoes from the Revolution.' Captain Glazier is a member of the\r\n     'Grand Army' in good standing, and will be assisted here by the\r\n     members of Post 14, with whom he will divide the profits of the\r\n     lecture. The Captain was an inmate of Libby Prison at one time\r\n     during the war, and finally made his escape to the Union lines. The\r\n     book entitled 'Capture, Prison-Pen and Escape,' and several other\r\n     war books, were produced by him.\"\r\n\r\nReaching Fonda, May twenty-sixth, we find the following entry in his\r\nJournal: \"Scenery charming. I saw nothing in Massachusetts equal to the\r\nValley of the Mohawk, and am surprised that novelist and poet have not\r\nfound more material here for legendary romance.\"\r\n\r\nPassing through St. Johnsville, Little Falls, Utica, and Rome--where he\r\nmet a large number of his \"Grand Army\" comrades, and was introduced to\r\nHon. H. J. Coggeshall, Colonel G. A. Cantine, Hon. W. T. Bliss, and many\r\nothers--he arrived in Syracuse June second, registered at the Vanderbilt\r\nHouse, and lectured at Shakespere Hall in the evening. Rochester was\r\nreached on the eighth, where the tenth lecture was delivered to an\r\nappreciative audience in Corinthian Hall--the introduction being made by\r\nColonel Reynolds. The Rochester _Democrat_ noticed the lecture in the\r\nfollowing paragraph:\r\n\r\n     \"A very large audience assembled at Corinthian Hall last evening to\r\n     listen to Captain Willard Glazier's lecture on 'Echoes from the\r\n     Revolution.' The lecture was a very interesting one, and the\r\n     audience were agreeably entertained. Captain Glazier proposes to go\r\n     to Batavia, and from thence to Buffalo. He is meeting with deserved\r\n     success in his journey on horseback from ocean to ocean, which\r\n     increases as he becomes better known.\"\r\n\r\nIt may here be remarked that during Captain Glazier's stay in Rochester,\r\nan exception was made to the usually courteous reception given him by\r\nthe local press. One of the papers threw doubts on the genuineness of\r\nhis credentials and the rectitude of his motives. This, however, had\r\nlittle effect on him. He was conscious of his own integrity of purpose,\r\nand of being guided by a desire to do good while seeking knowledge and\r\nrecreation in his own way, and the only notice we find of the\r\ncircumstance in his Journal is in a few words under date of June\r\neleventh: \"Was pleased with an article in the _Express_, contradicting\r\nfalsehoods in the _Union_.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is the article referred to:\r\n\r\n    \"On Friday our evening contemporary took occasion to treat Captain\r\n    Willard Glazier, who lectured in Corinthian Hall the night previous,\r\n    with a degree of contempt and misrepresentation suggestive of\r\n    Confederate sympathies on the part of the writer. As to the methods\r\n    of Captain Glazier's business we have nothing to do. As a man and a\r\n    soldier, he is above reproach. We have examined the original\r\n    documentary testimonials to his military character, and no man could\r\n    be better endorsed. That he has devoted himself since the war to\r\n    illustrate the war of the rebellion in books and upon the rostrum is\r\n    to his credit, and certainly to the benefit of the people whose\r\n    patriotism he keeps alive by his appeals with pen and tongue. Doubt\r\n    was cast upon his services on account of his youth. But the fact\r\n    stands that Willard Glazier was a captain of cavalry at the age of\r\n    eighteen, certainly a higher record than that of a stay-at-home\r\n    Copperhead. He performed his duty, was honorably discharged, and is\r\n    a member in good standing of that noble organization of veterans,\r\n    the 'Grand Army of the Republic.' We trust that when Captain Glazier\r\n    comes again to Rochester, he will have better treatment and a still\r\n    better audience. His trip across the continent will result in the\r\n    public's having a record of observations which cannot fail to be\r\n    valuable and entertaining.\"\r\n\r\nBatavia, Croft's Station, Crittenden and Lancaster were passed through,\r\nthe usual courtesies tendered and accepted, lectures delivered with\r\nunvarying success, and the city of Buffalo reached on the morning of the\r\nnineteenth of June.\r\n\r\nWith a soldier's instinct, Glazier halted here at the parade-ground, and\r\nwitnessed the drill of the militia. He then located himself at No. 34\r\nOak Street, where he was visited by many comrades of the \"Grand Army\"\r\nand other prominent citizens of Buffalo. Arrangements having been made,\r\nhe lectured to a full house at St. James Hall, being introduced to the\r\naudience by Major John M. Farquhar. The following endorsement had\r\nappeared in the Buffalo _Express_ the day preceding his arrival in the\r\ncity, signed by prominent members of the \"Grand Army of the Republic:\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     Buffalo, New York,\r\n                                                  _June 18th, 1876._\r\n\r\n     Captain Willard Glazier served his country with great credit in the\r\n     Harris Light Cavalry. He was a brave soldier and has a splendid\r\n     army record. His numerous works upon army life, recording his\r\n     personal experiences on the battle-field, in camp and in prison,\r\n     are exceedingly interesting and of a highly patriotic character;\r\n     they are universally commended by the press and by men of army\r\n     experience.\r\n\r\n     He is highly endorsed as a member in good standing of the \"Grand\r\n     Army of the Republic,\" and as a lecturer.\r\n\r\n     The object of his lectures being to add to the fund for a Soldiers'\r\n     Home in this State, we most cheerfully commend him to the people of\r\n     this city, and earnestly hope he will receive a liberal patronage,\r\n     and have a full house at St. James Hall on Monday evening, the\r\n     nineteenth of June.\r\n\r\n     [Signed]\r\n\r\n               George N.

His road laid along the banks of Lake Erie, a\r\ncircumstance which he notes in his diary as one of the events of his\r\njourney, the beauty of the scenery, and fresh, cool air from the lake\r\nbeing exceedingly pleasant and grateful on a hot day in June. He rode\r\n\"Paul\" down to the beach and into the water up to his girths.\r\n\r\nJune twenty-fourth, we find the following entry:\r\n\r\n\"My journey from North Evans to Angola has been unusually pleasant. I\r\ncould see the lake, and feel its cool refreshing influence nearly the\r\nwhole distance.\"\r\n\r\nAngola is situated on the Lake Shore Railroad, about three-quarters of a\r\nmile from Lake Erie. Here Mr. J. S. Parker, formerly of Malone, New\r\nYork, called upon him on business connected with the lecture, and in the\r\ncourse of conversation, Captain Glazier discovered that his visitor knew\r\nmany of his old neighbors and acquaintances in Northern New York. The\r\nevents of his early years along the banks of the Oswegatchie were\r\ndiscussed with much interest, and it doubtless formed a pleasing episode\r\nof his journey. The lecture was delivered with satisfactory results, at\r\nthe regular hour, in a building that had once been a church, but was now\r\nused as the Town Hall, and the introduction made by Leroy S. Oatman.\r\n\r\nDunkirk was reached June twenty-fifth, by way of the Buffalo Road. The\r\nbeautiful lake, which had been very near the road from Buffalo to\r\nAngola, was now seldom seen, but the haying season had commenced, and\r\nthe captain's love of nature was now gratified by the lively spectacle\r\nof the mowers and hay-makers--men, women and children at work in the\r\nfields as he rode past. Putting up at the Eastern Hotel, he was ready\r\nto deliver his lecture in the evening, and at Columbus Hall was\r\nintroduced to a respectable audience by the Rev. J. A. Kummer, pastor of\r\nthe Methodist church of Dunkirk. The following day being Sunday, he\r\nattended divine service at the Rev. Mr. Kummer's church.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Dunkirk the following testimonial was handed him:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     Dunkirk, New York,\r\n                                                     _June 25th, 1876._\r\n\r\n     Captain Glazier:\r\n\r\n     We desire to express to you our warm appreciation of your highly\r\n     instructive and most entertaining lecture delivered here this\r\n     evening.

Morrell\r\n\r\n\r\nDunkirk, with its pleasant associations, was left June twenty-seventh,\r\nand, continuing along the Buffalo Road, our cavalier stopped for dinner\r\nat Silver Creek. Here he found the farmers of Chautauqua County largely\r\nengaged in the cultivation of fruit and grain. The flourishing vineyards\r\nnear Fredonia had also arrested his attention, giving promise of the\r\nextensive cultivation of the grape which has since marked this locality.\r\nAt Westfield he lectured in the Metropolitan Hall, being introduced by\r\nGeorge Wilson, Esq., and on the following day passed through a fine\r\nfruit and grain region, stopping at a village named State Line for\r\ndinner. Here he had some trouble in finding the landlord of the\r\ncaravansary, who, combining the business of \"mine host\" with that of a\r\nfarmer, was at the time some distance away, industriously employed at\r\nhoeing corn.\r\n\r\nAt five o'clock P. M., Captain Glazier reached the flourishing little\r\ntown of North East, where he found a large crowd of people in front of\r\nthe Haynes House awaiting his arrival. He was taken by surprise when\r\ntold that he had been announced to deliver a lecture there that evening.\r\nThe band of the place escorted him to the \"Hall,\" and, taking position\r\nin front of the audience, played \"Hail Columbia\" before, and \"The Sword\r\nof Bunker Hill\" after the lecture. This was a voluntary and quite an\r\nunexpected compliment to Captain Glazier, who was sensibly affected by\r\nit. The \"Hall\" was so crowded that many were compelled to stand\r\nthroughout the lecture, and if applause is any evidence of the\r\nsatisfaction of the applauders, he might fairly consider his effort to\r\nentertain the \"North Easters\" a decided success. Captain Bronson Orton\r\nintroduced him to this audience, a gentleman who, although now in the\r\npeaceful practice of the law, had been with Sherman's army in its\r\nmemorable march through Georgia.\r\n\r\nArrived at Erie, Pennsylvania, June twenty-ninth, Captain Glazier was\r\ncordially welcomed by Colonel F. H. Ellsworth, proprietor of the Reed\r\nHouse, who showed him many attentions while his guest. The lecture was\r\ndelivered to a full house at the Academy of Music, the introduction\r\nbeing made by Hon. C. B. Carter.\r\n\r\nAt Swanville he became the guest of John Jacob Swan, an old and worthy\r\nresident, after whom the village had been named. Everything was done for\r\nhis comfort by the Swan family, of which we find some pleasant\r\nreminiscences noted in the Journal. Mr. Swan's son, Andrew, was a\r\nlieutenant-colonel of cavalry during the civil war, and the patriarch\r\nhimself had participated in the war of 1812. \"Mr. Swan was one of the\r\nfirst settlers in Erie County,\" Captain Glazier notes, \"and although\r\nmore than fifty years have passed, this old veteran still remembers\r\ndistinctly, and describes minutely, the scenes and events of his former\r\nlife. He saw the first steamer launched on Lake Erie, and says it was\r\nregarded by the Indians as an evil omen: they styled it 'the devil's\r\ncanoe,' were greatly frightened, and ran from the lake.... Took a stroll\r\nwith Mr. Swan over his farm. He found great pleasure in showing me the\r\nwonderful changes which a half century has wrought upon his estate.\"\r\n\r\nTaking leave of this amiable family, he left for Girard, and found P. J.\r\nFarrington, his advance agent, awaiting him at the Central House. At the\r\nlecture in the evening he was introduced by Jacob Bender, Esq., a brass\r\nband adding to the entertainment, and afterwards serenading him at his\r\nhotel. The Girard _Cosmopolite_ came out on the next morning with the\r\nfollowing notice of the lecture:\r\n\r\n     \"Captain Willard Glazier, the soldier-author and lecturer, now on a\r\n     journey on horseback from Boston to San Francisco, reached this\r\n     place on Saturday evening, and delivered his lecture, 'Echoes from\r\n     the Revolution,' to a highly respectable audience, at Philharmonic\r\n     Hall. He speaks with a soldier's enthusiasm of those stirring times\r\n     when our forefathers 'walked through a baptism of blood and of\r\n     fire, their only purpose liberty; their only incentive duty; their\r\n     only pride their country; and their only ambition victory.' He\r\n     traces, in a very eloquent manner, the movements of the\r\n     Revolutionary heroes from that day in April, 1775, when the\r\n     undisciplined militia at Concord put the red-coats to flight and\r\n     forced them to retire to their intrenchments at Boston, onward to\r\n     the surrender of Cornwallis to Washington.... We are credibly\r\n     informed that one of the chief objects of Captain Glazier's journey\r\n     is to make observations and collect material for another book,\r\n     which will no doubt be a very interesting one to read, and will add\r\n     still greater honors to one who, though still a young man, has\r\n     already acquired an enviable reputation as an author. After a very\r\n     cordial shake of the hand from some comrades and citizens, the\r\n     captain left the Central Hotel on his fine black horse, 'Paul\r\n     Revere,' which has brought him safely thus far from Boston since\r\n     the ninth of May, and which he proposes to ride to the Golden Gate\r\n     by the first of December next.\"\r\n\r\nJuly third found Captain Glazier at Ashtabula, Ohio. The people\r\neverywhere, during his ride from Girard, were engaged in preparations\r\nfor the celebration on the following day of the glorious Centennial\r\nFourth. It was his intention to have lectured at Ashtabula, but he was\r\ncounselled not to do so, as almost every man and woman in the place was\r\nupon some committee preparing for the next day's festivities, and he\r\nwould consequently get but a scant audience. He therefore concluded not\r\nto deliver his lecture here, but to push forward on his journey.\r\n\r\nUnder date July fourth, he writes:\r\n\r\n     \"Mounted 'Paul' at nine o'clock this morning in front of the Fisk\r\n     House, Ashtabula. Thousands upon thousands of country people were\r\n     pouring into the town as I rode out. The booming of cannon, blowing\r\n     of engine whistles, ringing of bells, and the discharge of\r\n     fire-arms of every variety and calibre, welcomed the dawn of the\r\n     One Hundredth anniversary of American Independence.\"\r\n\r\nWillard Glazier suffered no occasion to pass that presented a chance of\r\npicking up useful information on topics connected with the localities he\r\nrode through--their population, industries, features of the country,\r\nprominent men, etc., his capacity for absorbing such knowledge being\r\nlarge, and the intention of utilizing it in the interest of the public\r\nhaving been his chief motive in undertaking the adventurous journey. The\r\nlarge amount of information thus collected has been reduced to system,\r\nand will, we trust, be shortly in the hands of the publisher.\r\n\r\nCleveland--the \"Forest City\"--was his next destination, and on July\r\nsixth he registered at the Forest City House, and delivered his lecture\r\nin the evening at Garrett's Hall. He was introduced by Major E. M.\r\nHessler, of the \"Grand Army of the Republic,\" who, in the name of many\r\ncitizens and in testimony of their respect for the soldier, author, and\r\nlecturer, proposed a banquet on the following day. This, however, was\r\nmodestly and respectfully declined. The result of the lecture is shown\r\nin the following letter:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                               National Soldiers' Home,\r\n                                       Dayton, Ohio, _July 27th, 1876_.\r\n\r\n     Captain Willard Glazier:\r\n\r\n     My dear Comrade: We have received through Major E. M. Hessler your\r\n     generous donation to aid in erecting the Soldiers' Monument at the\r\n     \"Home.\" You have the hearty thanks of three thousand disabled\r\n     veterans now on our rolls; and a cordial invitation to visit us\r\n     whenever it is your pleasure to do so. Again we thank you. Please\r\n     find receipt from our treasurer,\r\n\r\n                                              Very respectfully,\r\n                                                     William Earnshaw,\r\n                           President, Historical and Monumental Society.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile in Cleveland the terrible news of the massacre of General Custer\r\nby the Indians reached Captain Glazier, who, as a cavalry officer, had\r\nseen service with him in the late war, and felt for him that respect and\r\nlove which only a true soldier knows for a brave leader. The stunning\r\nintelligence left a deep impression, and in due time he showed his\r\nrespect for the dead general by substantial aid rendered in the erection\r\nof a monument to his memory.\r\n\r\nThe following letter was received before leaving the Forest City:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                             Headquarters, Post No. 1,\r\n                      \"Grand Army of the Republic,\" Department of Ohio,\r\n                                     Cleveland, O., _July 12th, 1876._\r\n\r\n     Comrade: Through your unsolicited generosity I have the pleasure to\r\n     acknowledge the receipt of the net proceeds of your lecture on\r\n     \"Echoes from the Revolution,\" delivered in our city July sixth,\r\n     1876, and by your direction have forwarded the amount to Chaplain\r\n     William Earnshaw, President of the \"Soldiers' Home Monumental\r\n     Fund,\" at Dayton, to assist in erecting a monument to the memory of\r\n     the veterans, who by the fortunes of war await the long roll at the\r\n     National Military Home: and may your reward be no less than the\r\n     love and gratitude of our unfortunate comrades.\r\n\r\n             By order of\r\n                                    General James Barnett, Commanding.\r\n       E. M. Hessler, Q. M.\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaving Cleveland and the many friends who had flocked around him in\r\nthat hospitable city, offering encouragement in his undertaking, Glazier\r\nproceeded on his route, accompanied a short distance on horseback by an\r\nold scholar named Alexander Wilsey, whose affection for his teacher had\r\nnot diminished by years of separation. Keeping along the lake-shore all\r\nday, and not a little tormented by the shoals of mosquitoes as the\r\nevening advanced, he rode into Sandusky City, July thirteenth, and\r\ndelivered his lecture the same evening to a fair audience. He was\r\nintroduced in a humorous and effective speech by Captain Culver, Judge\r\nof the Probate Court.\r\n\r\nFremont, the pleasant home of President Hayes, was visited, and then on\r\nthrough Elmore to the flourishing city of Toledo, where he registered\r\nat the Boody House, July seventeenth. Introduced by Dr. J. T. Woods, G.\r\nA. R., he lectured at Lyceum Hall, to an interested audience, who\r\nfrequently signified their approval by applause.\r\n\r\nPassing through Erie, Michigan, Captain Glazier reached Monroe, July\r\ntwenty-fourth, the committee of the Custer Monument Association\r\nreceiving him at the City Hall. Arrangements were made for the delivery\r\nof a lecture in the interest of the fund for the erection of the\r\nmonument. This was of course most congenial to Glazier's feelings,\r\nCuster being his _beau ideal_ of a soldier, and he therefore at once\r\nplaced himself in the hands of the committee, offering them the entire\r\nproceeds of the lecture. The Monroe _Monitor_, of July twenty-sixth,\r\nnoticed the proposal thus:\r\n\r\n     \"The lecture announced to be given for the benefit of the Custer\r\n     Monument Fund, on Monday evening at the City Hall, was postponed\r\n     for various reasons until Thursday evening at the same place. On\r\n     Monday evening several members of the association met Captain\r\n     Glazier, and were most favorably impressed with him. They are\r\n     convinced that he is thoroughly in earnest, and his proposition is\r\n     a most liberal one. He offers to give the entire proceeds of his\r\n     lectures to the association; and not only in this city but\r\n     throughout the State, he generously offers to do the same thing.\r\n     This is certainly deserving of the warm recognition of our own\r\n     people at least, and we hope on Thursday evening to see the City\r\n     Hall filled. Captain Glazier comes with the strongest endorsements\r\n     from well-known gentlemen in the East, both as to his character as\r\n     a gentleman and a soldier, and his ability as a speaker and writer.\r\n     The captain served under the late General Custer in the cavalry,\r\n     and has something to say regarding his personal knowledge of the\r\n     dead hero....\"\r\n\r\nThe lecture was duly delivered, and the following certificate placed in\r\nhis hands:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 Headquarters,\r\n                                  Custer National Monument Association,\r\n                                    Monroe, Mich., _July 28th, 1876_.\r\n\r\n     This is to certify that the proceeds of the lecture by Captain\r\n     Willard Glazier in this city on Thursday evening, July 27th, 1876,\r\n     have been paid into the treasury of this association; for which the\r\n     members hereby tender him their sincere thanks.\r\n\r\n                                                          T. E. Wing,\r\n                                                             Treasurer.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following also is evidence of the benevolent aims of Captain Glazier\r\nduring his journey in the saddle:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 Headquarters,\r\n                                  Custer National Monument Association,\r\n                                    Monroe, Mich., _July 28th, 1876_.\r\n     _To Auxiliary Societies and Associations of the\r\n       Custer Monument Association:_\r\n\r\n     Captain Willard Glazier having kindly and generously volunteered to\r\n     devote the proceeds of his lectures through Michigan to the fund\r\n     being raised by this Association for the erection of a monument to\r\n     the memory of the late General George A. Custer, he has made\r\n     arrangements to remit to our treasurer here the money derived from\r\n     such lectures, and we bespeak for him your earnest endeavors in aid\r\n     of our common, glorious cause. Respectfully,\r\n\r\n                                                        J. M. Bulkley,\r\n                                                             Secretary.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Monroe, Glazier called upon Mr. E. J. Custer, the father\r\nof the deceased general, whom he represents as nearly crushed by the\r\nmelancholy news of his son's tragic death. The worthy old gentleman was\r\nvery courteous, and showed him some photographs and an oil-portrait of\r\nthe late general, together with some relics from the Indian country\r\nwhich the general had sent him at different times. Mr. Custer seemed\r\ngreatly interested in the journey on horseback, and asked the captain\r\nmany questions concerning his plans for crossing the plains. Finally, he\r\naccompanied Captain Glazier as far as Strong's Hotel, and witnessed his\r\nstart from Monroe. During his stay in Monroe our soldier-author was\r\nintroduced to several prominent gentlemen of the place, and plans were\r\ndiscussed for availing themselves of his proffered services in behalf of\r\nthe monument. The lecture was a financial success, and the whole of the\r\nproceeds were turned over to the Treasurer, Judge T. E. Wing. \"I gave\r\nthem all, although they generously offered to divide with me,\" is the\r\nsimple entry in his journal under date July twenty-eighth.\r\n\r\nPassing through Rockwood, Trenton, Wyandotte, and Ecorse, all in the\r\nState of Michigan, he reached Detroit on the thirty-first of July, and\r\nwas met by General William A. Throop at the Russell House, as one of a\r\ncommittee appointed to confer with him on the subject of his lecture. At\r\nthe usual hour the lecture was delivered to a full house at Saint\r\nAndrew's Hall, General L. S. Trowbridge introducing the lecturer to the\r\naudience in very complimentary terms.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the proceeds were turned over to the monument fund as\r\nindicated in the following letter to the treasurer, and its\r\nacknowledgment by the local committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     Detroit, Michigan,\r\n                                                   _August 1st, 1876_.\r\n\r\n     T. E. Wing, Esq., Treasurer, Custer National Monument Association:\r\n\r\n    Dear Sir: I send you through General L. S. Trowbridge of this city\r\n    the net proceeds of my lecture delivered at St. Andrew's Hall last\r\n    night, the same to be applied to the fund of the Custer National\r\n    Monument Association, for the erection of a monument to the memory\r\n    of the late General Custer at Monroe. I hope and expect to be able\r\n    to send you much larger contributions as soon as the lecture season\r\n    is fairly open. My horse is still in excellent condition, and I\r\n    anticipate a delightful and successful ride across the Peninsular\r\n    State. Promising to write you again from Ypsilanti, I am\r\n\r\n                                           Ever truly yours,\r\n                                                      Willard Glazier.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     Detroit, Michigan,\r\n                                                   _August 1st, 1876._\r\n\r\n     Received of Captain Willard Glazier, forty dollars, for the benefit\r\n     of the Custer Monument Association, as the proceeds of his lecture\r\n     at Detroit on the evening of July 31st, 1876, in aid of such\r\n     association.\r\n\r\n                                        [Signed] L. S. Trowbridge,\r\n                                                   William A. Throop,\r\n                                                             Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile in Detroit, Captain Glazier visited all the public buildings and\r\nplaces of note, enjoying the courtesies and hospitality of many of its\r\nleading citizens; and, encouraged by the success he had met with so far\r\nin contributing to the Custer Monument Fund, he determined to devote the\r\nnet proceeds of all his lectures delivered between Detroit and Chicago\r\nto the same object.\r\n\r\nLeaving Detroit and passing through Inkster, he reached Ypsilanti\r\nthrough torrents of rain, and the same evening--August fifth--received\r\ncalls at the Hawkins House from a large number of patriotic gentlemen\r\ninterested in the Custer monument. The lecture was duly delivered in\r\nUnion Hall and the proceeds handed over to the fund.\r\n\r\nArrived at Jackson, \"a most enterprising little city,\" as Captain\r\nGlazier notes, August ninth, and delivered his lecture in the evening at\r\nBronson Hall, to a very full house. The Jackson _Citizen_ said on the\r\nfollowing morning:\r\n\r\n     \"Captain Willard Glazier lectured last evening in the interest of\r\n     the Custer Monument Fund. His lecture was a good historical review\r\n     delivered with graceful rhetoric and at times real eloquence. The\r\n     captain is still in the city giving his horse--a noble Kentucky\r\n     Black Hawk, whom he has ridden all the way from Boston, and whom he\r\n     expects to carry him to San Francisco--a rest. He starts to-morrow\r\n     morning for Battle-Creek, where he lectures on Saturday evening.\"\r\n\r\nThrough Parma, Albion, and on to Battle-Creek, which was reached August\r\ntwelfth. Lieutenant Eugene T. Freeman here took the role of host and\r\nwelcomed Captain Glazier to the city, introducing him to many admirers\r\nand friends of the late General Custer. Arrangements were completed for\r\nthe lecture, which took place at the usual hour in Stuart's Hall before\r\na numerous and attentive audience--the introduction being made by\r\nLieutenant Freeman, and the proceeds applied to the monument fund. The\r\nfollowing day being Sunday the lieutenant's invitation was accepted to\r\naccompany him to church, where an introduction to the pastor, Rev. Mr.\r\nPalmer, and others, took place. In the afternoon Captain Glazier was\r\nagreeably surprised by an invitation from Lieutenant Freeman to ride\r\nwith him in his carriage to the delightful summer resort of that\r\nregion--Goguac Lake; and in many other ways Lieutenant Freeman\r\nmanifested a very friendly and cordial feeling for him.\r\n\r\nContrary to Captain Glazier's intention on setting out from Boston he\r\nyielded to invitations to lecture at Albion and Marshall, and, in the\r\ninterest of the Custer Monument, also determined to visit South Bend,\r\nIndiana; and Grand Rapids, Michigan; which cities were not included in\r\nthe route he had originally marked out for himself.\r\n\r\nAt Kalamazoo he delivered his lecture to a crowded house, being\r\nintroduced by Major Judson, late of General Custer's staff. Nearing\r\nComstock, Captain Glazier met with a serious adventure. His horse \"Paul\"\r\nbecoming frightened by the approach of a train on the Michigan Central\r\nRailway, dashed over the embankment into the Kalamazoo River--a fall of\r\nnearly forty feet, and the captain came very near losing his life. No\r\nbones were broken, however, the result being happily confined to a\r\nconsiderable ducking and a no less considerable scare; \"Paul\" having\r\nfared as ill as his master.\r\n\r\nThe following letters and press notices will show the nature of the\r\nreception our soldier-author met with in Kalamazoo, Grand Rapids and\r\nSouth Bend, respectively:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   Kalamazoo, Michigan,\r\n                                                   _August 18th, 1876_.\r\n\r\n     J.

Judson, the net proceeds of my lecture\r\n     delivered in this place on the evening of the sixteenth instant. I\r\n     desire to accompany my gift with an acknowledgment of many\r\n     courtesies extended by the press and band of this patriotic\r\n     village. I resume my journey this afternoon and shall speak at\r\n     Niles, South Bend, and Laporte before the close of the present\r\n     week. Hoping that your brightest anticipations for the \"Monument\"\r\n     may be most fully realized, I remain,\r\n\r\n                         Always sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n                                                     Willard Glazier.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   Kalamazoo, Michigan,\r\n                                                   _August 19th, 1876_.\r\n\r\n     Received of Captain Willard Glazier the net proceeds of his lecture\r\n     at this place, which sum is to be applied to the fund for the\r\n     erection of a monument to the memory of the late General Custer, at\r\n     Monroe City, Michigan.\r\n\r\n     We take great pleasure in speaking of Captain Glazier in the\r\n     highest terms, not only on account of the self-devotion he has\r\n     manifested in a noble cause, but of his indomitable perseverance\r\n     and energy. We trust he will, wherever he goes, receive the\r\n     unanimous support of the citizens whom he addresses.\r\n\r\n                                                    F. W.

Volunteers.\r\n\r\n     I take great pleasure in fully endorsing the above and recommending\r\n     to public confidence and support, Captain Willard Glazier, in his\r\n     efforts in behalf of the Custer Monument Association.\r\n\r\n                                                        R. F. Judson,\r\n                                            Late aide to General Custer.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the South Bend _Herald_:\r\n\r\n     \"As heretofore announced in these columns, Captain Glazier\r\n     delivered his lecture 'Echoes from the Revolution' at the Academy\r\n     of Music last evening. Promptly at eight o'clock, the lecturer,\r\n     with Mr. J. F. Creed, appeared on the platform. Mr. Creed, in\r\n     introducing the lecturer, stated the object of the lecture to be in\r\n     aid of the Custer Monument Association of Monroe, Michigan. He also\r\n     read several letters introducing Captain Glazier to the public,\r\n     from well-known citizens of Michigan, and acknowledging receipts of\r\n     the proceeds of the lectures delivered in Detroit and Kalamazoo.\r\n     The theme of the lecture afforded a fine field for the display of\r\n     Captain Glazier's talents as a speaker. Possessing a fine\r\n     imagination, good descriptive powers, and the real qualities of an\r\n     orator, he could not fail to please the really intelligent audience\r\n     which greeted him last evening. Probably one hour and a half were\r\n     consumed in its delivery, but the interest and attention of the\r\n     audience did not flag nor tire, and when the speaker took leave of\r\n     his audience, he was greeted with several rounds of applause.\"\r\n\r\nAbout this time his Boston friends were notified of his progress toward\r\nthe setting sun in the following paragraph of the Boston _Inquirer_:\r\n\r\n     \"Captain Willard Glazier, who undertook in May last to ride from\r\n     this city to the Golden Gate on horseback, has reached Michigan,\r\n     and has discoursed to large audiences at the various points along\r\n     his route. The profits of his lecture at Cleveland, Ohio, were\r\n     donated to the fund at Dayton, to assist in erecting a monument to\r\n     the memory of the veterans who by the fortunes of war are destined\r\n     to await the long roll-call at the National Military Home.\"\r\n\r\nTo return to his present point of departure, South Bend, Captain Glazier\r\nhaving found his horse \"Paul\" suffering from the accident previously\r\nrecorded, and also from sore-back, had left him with a veterinary\r\nsurgeon at Michigan City for treatment, and sped on his way by rail to\r\nGrand Rapids. Here he lectured with favorable results, having been\r\nintroduced by General Innes.\r\n\r\nSaid the Grand Rapids _Eagle_:\r\n\r\n     \"A very large audience gathered at Luce's Hall last night to hear\r\n     Captain Willard Glazier. The speaker was earnest and impassioned,\r\n     his lecture was delivered with a force and eloquence that pleased\r\n     his hearers, and all who were in the hall went away glad that they\r\n     had been there, and ready to add to the praises that have been\r\n     bestowed on Captain Glazier as a soldier, author, and orator.\"\r\n\r\nDecatur, Dowagiac, Paw-Paw, Niles, and Buchanan, were all reached by\r\nrailway, for the purpose of giving \"Paul\" a rest and an opportunity of\r\nrecovering from his sore back. At Decatur, Glazier met an old comrade of\r\nthe \"Harris Light,\" named George L. Darby, with whom a pleasant exchange\r\nof reminiscences took place, and a cordial intercourse was renewed.\r\n\"Thirteen years,\" says Captain Glazier in his Journal, \"have slipped\r\naway, since the day of our capture at New Baltimore, which led him to\r\nBelle Isle, and me to Libby Prison.... Darby called this afternoon with\r\nfishing tackle, and proposed that we should go out to 'Lake of the\r\nWoods,' a small lake not far from the village, and try our luck with\r\nhook and line. We went, and a delightful boat-ride followed, but in the\r\nmatter of the fish which we tried to lure with tempting pieces of fresh\r\nmeat, they are still enjoying their native freedom.\" We suspect the\r\nfriends were too intent on fighting their battles o'er again to give due\r\nattention to their occupation.\r\n\r\nThe lecture here was delivered September fourth to a crowded house, over\r\ntwo hundred persons being compelled to stand for want of room to seat\r\nthem. Captain Glazier was accompanied to the platform by several leading\r\ncitizens, among whom were Hon. Ransom Nutting, Rev. Mr. Hoyt, Professor\r\nS. G. Burked and Albert W. Rogers, Esq., Mr. Nutting presenting him to\r\nthe audience. The following will show the opinion entertained of the\r\nlecturer:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     Decatur, Michigan,\r\n                                                 _September 4th, 1876._\r\n\r\n     Captain Willard Glazier,\r\n\r\n     My Dear Sir:--We take this means of expressing to you our\r\n     appreciation of the highly instructive and very entertaining\r\n     lecture delivered by you at Union Hall this evening.\r\n\r\n     Truly we admire your plan, and your generosity in giving the entire\r\n     proceeds to the Custer Monument Fund. Our endorsement is the\r\n     expression of our village people generally. You have made many\r\n     friends here.\r\n\r\n     May success attend you throughout your journey.\r\n\r\n                                            Very respectfully,\r\n                                                      S. Gordon Burked,\r\n                                                       Ransom Nutting,\r\n                                                      Albert W. Rogers.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving lectured successfully at the several intermediate towns before\r\nmentioned, Captain Glazier with \"Paul\" now directed his course to\r\nRolling Prairie, Indiana (a place romantic only in name), and thence to\r\nMichigan City. From the latter point he journeyed by railway to Chicago,\r\narrangements having been made for the delivery of his lecture in that\r\ncity for the benefit of the monument fund. A very full house greeted him\r\nat Farwell Hall. Major E. S. Weedon in introducing the lecturer alluded\r\nin an eloquent and touching manner to the record of the gallant Custer.\r\nThe lecture throughout its delivery was much applauded by the audience,\r\nwho appeared greatly interested; and the proceeds reached a handsome\r\nsum.\r\n\r\nThe following entry occurs in the Journal under date, Chicago, September\r\n12th, 1876:\r\n\r\n\"I shall now push on to Omaha and Cheyenne as rapidly as possible, in\r\nthe hope of passing Sherman at the summit of the mountains before the\r\nsnow is too deep to interrupt my progress. There are nine steps in my\r\njourney from Boston to San Francisco, namely, Albany, Buffalo, Toledo,\r\nChicago, Omaha, Cheyenne, Salt Lake City, Sacramento, and San Francisco.\r\nI have now taken four of these nine steps, and shall undertake to pass\r\nthe five remaining points by the first of December.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM CHICAGO TO OMAHA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Returns to Michigan City.--Joliet.--Thomas Babcock.--Herbert\r\n    Glazier.--Ottawa.--La Salle.--Colonel Stevens.--Press\r\n    Notice.--Taken for a highwayman.--Milan.--Davenport.--Press\r\n    Notice.--Iowa City.--Des Moines.--Press Notice.--Attacked by\r\n    prairie wolves.--Council Bluffs.--Omaha.\r\n\r\nCaptain Glazier having succeeded so far in his novel and adventurous\r\nundertaking, felt little concern as to his ability to accomplish the\r\nentire journey from ocean to ocean. He had ridden but one horse--his\r\nfaithful \"Paul,\" thus far, and having returned to Michigan City, found\r\nhim quite recovered and ready to pursue the journey. On the sixteenth of\r\nSeptember he took his departure from the latter city, and after riding a\r\ndistance of twenty-eight miles, rested for the night at Hobart, Indiana.\r\n\r\nOn the seventeenth he crossed the boundary between Indiana and Illinois.\r\nOn Grand Prairie, after dark, his ears were made familiar with the\r\npeculiar howl of the prairie wolf, numbers of which followed in his\r\ntrack for a distance of two or three miles. Not having seen any of these\r\nanimals before, he supposed them at first to be dogs, until advised by\r\n\"Paul's\" manner and movements that they were animals less friendly to\r\nhis equine companion.\r\n\r\nAt four o'clock in the afternoon, Glazier rode into Joliet, and met Mr.\r\nThomas Babcock, his advance agent, on Jefferson Street. Preparations had\r\nbeen made here for the delivery of the lecture, and several prominent\r\ncitizens called upon him, having heard of his projected visit to the\r\nplace. His brother Herbert, who was also acting in the capacity of\r\nadvance agent, had departed to Ottawa to prepare for a lecture there on\r\nthe twentieth. While at Joliet, Captain Glazier stopped at the Robertson\r\nHouse, the proprietor of which, Mr. Conklin, sent word through the\r\nagent, that the captain was to consider himself his guest.\r\n\r\nAt the suggestion of Mr. Conklin, Captain Glazier on leaving Joliet,\r\nrode his horse along the tow-path of the Michigan Canal, and borrowing a\r\nhook and line from a gentleman who was fishing, caught twenty-three\r\nperch in less than half an hour, the canal seeming literally alive with\r\nthis fish.\r\n\r\nLeaving Morris, in Grundy County, Illinois, his journey lay along the\r\nnorth bank of the Illinois River, and after encountering a very severe\r\nrain storm, he reached Ottawa, September twentieth, stopping at the\r\nClifton House. From the proprietors of this hotel he received many\r\ncourtesies. The lecture, as arranged, was delivered in the evening with\r\nthe usual satisfactory results.\r\n\r\nOn leaving Ottawa, the captain followed the telegraph poles along the\r\nIllinois River, passing a large number of very fine corn-fields, and\r\novertaking an emigrant train on its journey from Ohio to Western\r\nNebraska. La Salle was reached at six o'clock on the evening of the\r\ntwenty-first. Here he enjoyed the society and hospitality of Colonel R.\r\nC. Stevens, and was introduced to a number of other prominent gentlemen,\r\nwho were attracted to him by their interest in the projected monument to\r\nGeneral Custer. The lecture was delivered at Opera Hall, Colonel Stevens\r\nmaking the introduction. The following letter may be presented here to\r\nshow the estimation in which Captain Glazier continued to be held as he\r\nprogressed in his journey westward:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  La Salle, Illinois,\r\n                                                _September 25th, 1876_.\r\n\r\n     To Captain Willard Glazier: I take pleasure in expressing to you on\r\n     behalf of many of our citizens, the gratification afforded our\r\n     people who listened to your instructive and entertaining lecture\r\n     given at Opera Hall on Saturday evening. While in conversation with\r\n     several of our prominent citizens--among them, W. A. Work,\r\n     superintendent of our public schools; A. J. O'Connor, clerk of the\r\n     City Court; W. T. Mason, Esq., and others; all of whom were present\r\n     and heard your lecture--I was requested to write you and tender\r\n     their hearty thanks for the entertainment, and their good wishes\r\n     for your success in your ride across the continent. Should you ever\r\n     again visit our city, you can rest assured you will be most\r\n     cordially received.\r\n\r\n               Very truly yours,\r\n                                                     R. C. Stevens,\r\n                                         Late Colonel U. S. Volunteers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe La Salle _County Press_ noticed the lecturer in the following terms:\r\n\r\n     \"We have not often met with a more agreeable and pleasant gentleman\r\n     than Captain Willard Glazier, who entertained a very respectable\r\n     number of our citizens at Opera Hall on Saturday evening by\r\n     delivering a lecture on 'Echoes from the Revolution.' The captain\r\n     has a fine voice and his manner of delivery is decidedly\r\n     interesting, while his language is eloquent and fascinating. His\r\n     description of the battles of the Revolution, and the heroes who\r\n     took part in them, from the engagement on the little green at\r\n     Lexington down to the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown, was\r\n     grand indeed, and was received with frequent and enthusiastic\r\n     applause. In conclusion he referred in an eloquent and touching\r\n     manner to the 'Boys in Blue' who took part in the late war for the\r\n     Union, and all retired from the hall feeling that the evening had\r\n     been spent in an agreeable and profitable manner.\r\n\r\n     \"Captain Glazier served under Generals Kilpatrick and Custer during\r\n     the late war, since which time he has devoted much labor to\r\n     writing, and is now making the attempt to cross the continent from\r\n     Boston to San Francisco on horseback, for the purpose of collecting\r\n     material for another work. He left Boston in the early part of May,\r\n     and will endeavor to reach the Sacramento Valley before the fall of\r\n     the deep snow. His horse, 'Paul Revere,' is a magnificent animal,\r\n     black as a raven, with the exception of four white feet. He was\r\n     bred in Kentucky, of Black Hawk stock, has turned a mile in 2.33,\r\n     but owing to his inclination to run away on certain occasions, was\r\n     not considered a safe horse for the track. The captain, however,\r\n     has broke him to the saddle, and also convinced him that running\r\n     away is foolish business; consequently he and the captain have\r\n     become fast friends, and with 'Paul' for his only companion, the\r\n     gallant cavalryman proposes to cross the continent. Success attend\r\n     him!\"\r\n\r\nHaving heard at La Salle that he would find no difficulty in securing a\r\nnight's lodging at a village named Hollowayville, Captain Glazier pushed\r\non for that point, but on applying at the only place of accommodation\r\nfor travellers, was looked upon suspiciously by the German host and his\r\n_frau_, who politely intimated their belief that he was either a\r\nhighwayman or a horse-thief! These latter gentry had for some time\r\ninfested that section of Illinois, and Glazier inferred from the manner\r\nof the people that they more than half suspected him to be one of the\r\nJames or Younger brothers, whose exploits they had probably read of.\r\n\r\nTurning his back on the \"Grand Pacific Hotel,\" he at length succeeded by\r\ndint of much perseverance, in lodging himself and \"Paul\" at a farm-house\r\nfor the night, but not before he had fully satisfied the worthy farmer\r\nand his wife that he had no evil designs in desiring to spend the night\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, September twenty-fifth, the captain rode through a\r\nrich farming country, replete with \"corn-fields, fine stock and oceans\r\nof fruit.\"\r\n\r\nPassed through Wyanet, Annawan, and across the prairie--smiling\r\ncorn-fields and ripe orchards occasionally relieving the seemingly\r\ninterminable ocean of grass--and arrived at Milan, Illinois, on the\r\nevening of the twenty-seventh, remaining for the night.\r\n\r\nHere he met a Mr. Pullman, an old and intelligent miner who had recently\r\narrived from the Pacific coast, from whom he obtained valuable\r\ninformation concerning the country between Omaha and Sacramento. He also\r\nfound a number of congenial spirits at Milan, chiefly New Yorkers, who\r\nhad spent some years in the Far West, and their conversation partook of\r\na practical nature bearing on his journey.\r\n\r\nLeaving Milan on the following day, he crossed the Government Bridge,\r\nwhich unites Rock Island with the fine city of Davenport, Iowa, and\r\nregistered at the Burtis House--the rider and his horse continuing in\r\nthe best of health.\r\n\r\nThe lecture at Davenport was delivered at the usual hour at Moore's Hall\r\nto a very large and applauding audience, General Sanders presenting him.\r\nThe brass band of the place volunteered their services, and appeared in\r\nfull uniform. The Davenport _Gazette_ of October fourth said:\r\n\r\n     \"The lecture of Captain Willard Glazier at Moore's Hall last\r\n     evening was attended by a large and appreciative audience. The\r\n     captain was introduced by our worthy fellow-citizen, General\r\n     Sanders, who spoke of the lecturer's career as a soldier and an\r\n     author, and said he was _en route_ for the Pacific coast on\r\n     horseback, and lecturing for the benefit of the Custer Monument\r\n     Fund....\"\r\n\r\nThe following notice is taken from the _Democrat_ of the same city:\r\n\r\n     \"We had the pleasure of meeting Captain Glazier this morning, who\r\n     arrived here on horseback from La Salle on Saturday evening. He is\r\n     making the journey from Boston to San Francisco on horseback, and\r\n     alone, for the purpose of seeing the country, studying the people,\r\n     and gathering materials for a new work he is engaged upon. Captain\r\n     Glazier is well known to fame as a writer, having published several\r\n     valuable works, among them a war-record entitled, 'Capture,\r\n     Prison-Pen and Escape.'\r\n\r\n     \"At the breaking out of the war, Willard Glazier, then a mere\r\n     youth, entered the Harris Light Cavalry, under Colonel Judson\r\n     Kilpatrick, and remained in the service until the close of the\r\n     rebellion, his career being marked by many adventures and\r\n     hair-breadth escapes. His feat of riding on horseback across the\r\n     continent, unattended, to gather materials for a book, is certainly\r\n     without a precedent, and shows a brave and intrepid spirit. His\r\n     horse 'Paul' was an object of great curiosity and interest.\"\r\n\r\nLeaving Davenport, our traveller passed through Moscow and reached Iowa\r\nCity October fifth. The weather was now becoming very cold, and he found\r\nit necessary to dismount occasionally and walk some warmth into his\r\nlimbs.\r\n\r\nRegistering at the St. James Hotel, Iowa City, Captain Glazier lectured\r\nin the evening to a very full house, a profusion of cheers greeting him\r\non his arrival upon the platform, whither he was escorted by George B.\r\nEdmunds, Esq.\r\n\r\nContinuing his journey through Tiffin and Brooklyn to Kellogg, all in\r\nthe State of Iowa, he witnessed, he says, some of the finest landscapes\r\nand grandest farms he had yet encountered during his journey. He rode\r\ninto Colfax, October twelfth, and Des Moines on the following day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Night Among Wolves.]\r\n\r\n\"I have not seen a brighter or more stirring city in my line of march\r\nthan Des Moines,\" writes Captain Glazier in his Journal. He wandered\r\nover the city in company with two or three of the leading citizens,\r\nadmiring its numerous fine buildings and the evidences of its rapid\r\nprogress; and the next day the Des Moines _Leader_ came out with the\r\nfollowing notice of his visit:\r\n\r\n     \"Captain Willard Glazier, the horseback traveler across the\r\n     continent, took in the Exposition on Saturday evening with intense\r\n     gratification. He says he has seen no place, on his route from\r\n     Boston, more promising than Des Moines. Among the calls he received\r\n     at the Jones House was one from Captain Conrad, a prominent\r\n     attorney from Missouri, and now settled in his profession in this\r\n     city, who was a fellow-captive with Captain Glazier in Libby Prison\r\n     during the rebellion. He continued his journey westward yesterday,\r\n     with the best wishes of the friends he has made during his short\r\n     stay here.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Glazier speaks very highly of the extremely courteous treatment\r\nhe received while at Des Moines.\r\n\r\nAdel, and Dale City, and Minden were passed, and arriving at Neola, we\r\nfind the following entry in the journal: \"Weather most disagreeable. A\r\ndrizzling rain made my ride to this place decidedly gloomy. My journey\r\nto-day, as usual, since entering Iowa, has been over the boundless,\r\nnever-ending prairie. I have never in my life beheld a grander sight\r\nthan this afternoon, when I reached the summit of an immense tableland\r\nbetween Avoca and Minden.\"\r\n\r\nWishing to reach Anita before halting for the night, he ventured to\r\ncontinue on the road after dark, although for some time before sunset he\r\nhad been unable to see a farm-house or even a tree as far as the eye\r\ncould reach. Giving \"Paul\" the rein, he followed a blind road, after\r\ncrossing a sluice-way, which ultimately led them to a haystack on the\r\nprairie, where the captain decided to spend the night. A pack of prairie\r\nwolves, or coyotes, soon came upon the scene, several of which he shot,\r\nbut he was shortly after reinforced by a friendly dog, who came to his\r\nrescue and kept the coyotes at bay for the remainder of the night. In\r\nthe morning at daybreak he was glad enough to say adieu to the haystack\r\nwhere he had passed one of the most unpleasant nights of his journey.\r\n\r\nIt may here be mentioned that the _coyote_ partakes of the natures of\r\nthe dog and the wolf, and is less dangerous to encounter in the summer\r\nthan in the winter, which is a characteristic of its wolfish nature. In\r\nthe winter, when food is scarce, these animals will attack man, but if a\r\nbold resistance is offered, they speedily decamp.\r\n\r\nHastening forward on his journey through various small and more or less\r\nenterprising cities of the prairie, our traveler reached Council Bluffs\r\nat eight o'clock in the evening of October twentieth. This promising\r\ncity is located three miles east from the Missouri River, and contains\r\nan enterprising population of some 20,000; its history dating from 1804.\r\nThe locality is surrounded by high bluffs, and hence the name given to\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\nStriking the Missouri opposite Omaha, our horseman found he would be\r\ncompelled to ride up the bank of the river and cross by ferry to the\r\nnorthern section of the city. On reaching the boat, \"Paul\" declined to\r\nembark, but with some encouragement and assistance he was at length made\r\nto understand that when rivers cannot be bridged or forded, they can\r\nsometimes be ferried, and so yielded to necessity.\r\n\r\nOmaha is almost equidistant between the Atlantic and Pacific, and has\r\nsprung up, flourished and waxed great in the twinkling of an eye. It is\r\nnow the grand gateway through which the western tide of travel and\r\nemigration is passing. The first house was erected here in 1853, and the\r\npopulation now numbers in the neighborhood of 30,000. Omaha can boast\r\nof as fine business blocks, hotels, school-buildings and churches as can\r\nbe found in many older and more pretentious cities in the East. There\r\nare also numerous elegant private residences, with grounds beautifully\r\nornamented with trees and shrubbery, which sufficiently attest the solid\r\nprosperity of Omaha's business men.\r\n\r\nA story is told of the postmaster of Omaha which illustrates the changes\r\nmade during the past few years. Mr. Jones, one of the first pioneers,\r\nwas appointed to the office of postmaster in the autumn of 1854. At that\r\ntime there was no office, while letters were rarities. The few letters\r\nthat did come were kept by the postmaster in the crown of his hat till\r\nhe met their owners. Only a few years have elapsed since this primitive\r\nstate of things, and the post-office of Omaha has expanded from a hat\r\ninto a handsome stone building, worth $350,000, in which some twenty\r\nclerks find full employment.\r\n\r\nHearing of the impossibility of riding his valuable horse across the\r\nAlkali Plains, he resolved to leave him at Omaha until his return from\r\nSan Francisco, and to continue his journey on a mustang. In these plains\r\nthe soil for two or three feet seems saturated with soda, and so poisons\r\nthe water that if drunk by man or beast, after a fall of rain, is sure\r\nto be fatal. \"Paul\" was therefore turned over by his master to the care\r\nof G. W. Homan, proprietor of the Omaha Livery Stable; and a good\r\nserviceable mustang purchased of a Pawnee Indian, to replace him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPTURED BY INDIANS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Captain Glazier as a horseman.--Cheyenne.--Two herders.--Captured\r\n    by Indians.--Torture and death of a herder.--Escape.--Ogden.--\r\n    Letter to Major Hessler.--Kelton.--Terrace.--Wells.--Halleck.--\r\n    Elko.--Palisade.--Argenta.--Battle Mountain.--Golconda.--\r\n    Humboldt.--\"The majesty of the law.\"--Lovelock's.--White\r\n    Plains.--Desert.--Wadsworth.--Truckee.--Summit.--Sacramento.--\r\n    Brighton.--Stockton.--SAN FRANCISCO.\r\n\r\nHaving made several friends in Omaha, and obtained all the information\r\nwithin his reach concerning the remaining half of the journey, Captain\r\nGlazier mounted his mustang and proceeded on his route across the State\r\nof Nebraska. Over the great plains that lie between the Missouri River\r\nand the mountains, his nerve as a horseman was most thoroughly tested,\r\nand not less so, the mettle of his mustang, which carried him a distance\r\nof five hundred and twenty-two miles in six days. The approach of winter\r\nsuggested the importance of reaching his destination at the earliest\r\npossible date; therefore on riding into Cheyenne October twenty-eighth,\r\nhe lost no time in arranging to continue his journey.\r\n\r\nThe weather now became intensely cold, as he neared the highest point in\r\nhis line of march. Since leaving Omaha, the ascent had been gradual but\r\ncontinuous, and the point now reached was eight thousand feet above the\r\nsea-level.\r\n\r\nCheyenne, the \"Magic City of the Plains,\" about five hundred and twenty\r\nmiles west of Omaha, stands at an elevation of six thousand feet above\r\nthe level of the sea, and is perhaps the most progressive city west of\r\nChicago. It is the capital of Wyoming Territory, the county-seat of\r\nLaramie County, and is the largest town between Omaha and Salt Lake\r\nCity. The gold discoveries in the Black Hills of Dakota added greatly to\r\nits prosperity. In proportion to its population, Cheyenne has more\r\nelegant and substantial business houses than most any other western\r\ncity. This is a wonderful change from a place known the world over by\r\nits fearful sobriquet of \"Hell on Wheels.\" Churches have risen where\r\ngamblers once reigned, and many other edifices for religious and\r\neducational purposes have been erected. Cheyenne is the trading-post for\r\nthe thousands of ranchemen and stock-raisers of the plains at the base\r\nof the Black Hills, and like all other frontier cities, has a history.\r\nIt was once a very fast town, and it is not very slow now.\r\n\r\nOn leaving Cheyenne he was accompanied by two herders, who were on their\r\nway to Salt Lake City with a few mustangs and ponies. It was the custom\r\nof Captain Glazier to have company in his rides through this wild region\r\nwhenever he could do so, and having made the acquaintance of these men\r\nin the city, it was arranged that they should journey together as far as\r\ntheir respective routes led them. The men were of the usual stamp of\r\nherders, rough in exterior and plain of speech, but apparently worthy of\r\ntrust. The captain was not wanting in discernment, and his cordial\r\nmanner won their confidence.\r\n\r\nSherman having afforded them a night's shelter and refreshment, their\r\ncourse lay in the direction of the Skull Rocks, a huge mass of granite\r\non the Great Laramie Plains, and so called from the resemblance of the\r\nrocks to human skulls.\r\n\r\nThe Skull Rocks being in front of them at no great distance, the\r\nconversation of the party turned upon their peculiar configuration, and\r\nopinions were advanced by each of a more or less intelligent character;\r\nthe herders insisting on the probability of their having plenty of gold\r\nin them. Suddenly, over a slight elevation in the land, appeared a body\r\nof Indians, in number about thirteen or fourteen. Glazier and his\r\ncompanions were not at first surprised, as Indians are often found on\r\nthese plains--some friendly and some hostile--but mostly those of the\r\nfriendly tribes. The Indians now advancing upon them were clearly not on\r\na friendly errand, and were pronounced by the herders to be a detachment\r\nof the Arrapahoes. They were decked in their war-paint, and on seeing\r\nthe white men immediately raised their war-shout, which, as travellers\r\non the plains are aware, always indicates an intention to attack.\r\n\r\nThe herders, knowing that they were in the presence of an enemy who\r\nwould speedily relieve them of their merchandise, made conciliatory\r\nsigns, by raising their hands, a signal which is equivalent to a flag of\r\ntruce, and is so understood on the plains. The signal of truce was,\r\nhowever, ignored by the red-skins, who continued to advance at a rapid\r\npace, gradually forming a circle around Glazier and his companions. This\r\nis the usual Indian form of attack. The circle is kept constantly in\r\nrapid motion, the Indians concentrating their fire upon a stationary\r\nobject in the centre of the circle, while they render themselves a\r\nconstantly shifting target, and are thus comparatively safe from the\r\nfire of the centre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Captain Glazier Captured By Indians Near Skull\r\nRocks, Wyoming Territory.]\r\n\r\nRiding around, and firing at intervals of a minute or two at Glazier and\r\nhis companions, the latter did their best to defend themselves, and\r\nfired in return upon their cowardly assailants, who showed no desire for\r\na parley. The firing from the centre was made over the backs of the\r\nponies and mustangs, who in such emergencies are made to do duty as a\r\nbreastwork. The circle of red-skins gradually lessened in diameter, as\r\nthe firing on both sides continued, when a shot from the carbine of the\r\nMexican herder killed one of the Indians.\r\n\r\nThe circle continued to grow less, until the Indians in a mass rushed on\r\nthe three whites, disarmed them, secured them to each other with thongs\r\nat the wrists, and appropriated as their own the mustangs and ponies,\r\nwhich had been their primary object.\r\n\r\nBefore yielding, Captain Glazier and his little squad had nearly\r\nexhausted their ammunition, and felt that further resistance was not\r\nonly useless, but would certainly cost them their lives. Without loss of\r\ntime, the prisoners were compelled to mount, and the entire party--less\r\none Indian killed--started off in a northerly direction.\r\n\r\nIgnorant of their destination, the herders expressed their belief that\r\nthey would in a few days find themselves in the presence of Sitting\r\nBull, when their fate would be decided. They continued to ride at a full\r\ntrot till about ten o'clock, when the whole party dismounted and camped\r\nfor the night. A fire was speedily built, and some antelope beef\r\npartially roasted for their supper, of which the prisoners also\r\npartook.\r\n\r\nThe supper over, an animated conversation ensued among the Indians,\r\nwhile sundry furtive glances were cast in the direction of the Mexican\r\nwho had killed one of their party during the attack in the morning. For\r\na time they shouted and violently gesticulated, while one of them was\r\nobserved driving a thick pole into the ground, at about fifty yards from\r\nthe fire, around which the party and the prisoners squatted. Presently,\r\nat a sign from one of the Indians, supposed to be a chief named\r\n\"Dull-Knife,\" four of the red-skins seized the Mexican and forced him\r\ntowards the stake, where they stripped him to the skin, and then bound\r\nhim to it with thick cords. The whole party then, without further\r\nceremony, proceeded to torture the wretched man to death, as a\r\npunishment for his presumption in killing one of their party while\r\ndefending himself from their murderous attack near the Skull Rocks. They\r\nheated their arrow-shafts in the fire, and held them in contact with his\r\nnaked flesh, while others, at a distance of a few feet from their\r\nvictim, cast at him their sharp-pointed knives, which, penetrating the\r\nbody, remained embedded in the flesh, until he nearly died from the\r\nagony. One of the party now advanced with a revolver, and shot him in\r\nthe head, thus ending his sufferings.\r\n\r\nWhile the torture was proceeding, Captain Glazier and the remaining\r\nherder lay on the ground bound together by thick cords, and could offer\r\nno assistance to their tortured companion. The Mexican being dead, one\r\nof the party removed his scalp and fastened it to his waist, after which\r\nall sat down around the fire and seemed in high glee for the remainder\r\nof the evening, for the most part shouting and speech-making.\r\n\r\nWillard Glazier had never before witnessed a case of torture by the\r\nIndians. It is true it was of a different character from that he and\r\nmany of his old comrades had endured in Southern prisons; but in one\r\nrespect was more merciful, as the sufferings of their victim were soon\r\nended, while his own and his comrades extended over many months; in the\r\none case the body was burnt and lacerated--in the other it was starved\r\nand emaciated.\r\n\r\nThe horses of the party having been tethered by long ropes to stakes, to\r\nenable them to graze during the night, a guard of two Indians was placed\r\nin charge of the prisoners, who, still bound together at the wrists,\r\nwere made to lie down side by side, with an Indian on either hand. The\r\nremainder of the red-skins then disposed themselves around the fire for\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nGlazier and his companion slept but little, but pretended to do so. They\r\nwere continually on the alert, and the guard, believing their prisoners\r\nto be asleep, dozed, and at length reclined their bodies in a restless\r\nsleep. About two o'clock in the morning, the two Indians were relieved\r\nby two others, and all remained quiet in the camp. At the first streak\r\nof dawn, the whole body leaped to their feet and were ready to resume\r\ntheir march northward. Glazier and the herder were assigned each a\r\nmustang, which they quietly mounted under the close scrutiny of their\r\nguards, and the entire party started off at a brisk trot.\r\n\r\nNo attempt at escape having yet been made by the captives, the\r\nsurveillance became somewhat relaxed throughout the day, and the\r\nattention of the party was given to their own proper business of\r\nforaging. Wherever an opportunity offered, a momentary halt was called,\r\nand one of the party creeping cautiously up to a stray pony, would take\r\npossession by the simple process of mounting and riding him away. If\r\nmore than one animal was to be appropriated, an equal number of Indians\r\nwere detailed for the \"duty,\" and each leaping on the mustang or pony he\r\nhad selected, would ride off as only these freebooters of the plains can\r\nride, with little prospect of being overtaken by the owners. Thus the\r\nday passed; as a rule, half the number of the Indians remaining as a\r\nguard to the prisoners, while the others foraged for food, and anything\r\nthat could be conveniently carried off. They were now skirting the Black\r\nHills, and Glazier had discovered by this time that they were making\r\ntheir way to their general rendezvous, about one hundred miles from\r\nDeadwood.\r\n\r\nAs the second night overtook the captives, the process of the previous\r\nnight was repeated: they built their fire, cooked and ate their antelope\r\nsteaks, and then prostrated themselves around the fire for the night.\r\nThe captives were again bound together at the wrists, and lay between\r\ntheir two guards. Our friend was, however, on the alert and wide awake,\r\nthough pretending to be asleep. Quietly he passed the fingers of one\r\nhand over the cords that bound his other to his companion, and concluded\r\nthat with patience and vigilance the knot could be unfastened. While the\r\nguards dozed and slept as on the preceding night, the eyes of the\r\nprisoners stealthily sought the ponies and the arms.\r\n\r\nThe latter were always placed at the head of each sleeper, to be ready\r\nfor immediate use in case of a surprise. Captain Glazier and his\r\ncompanion were fully convinced that any attempt to escape, if detected,\r\nwould be followed by immediate torture and death; but were,\r\nnevertheless, resolved to make the effort. It was also known that if\r\nthey quietly accompanied the Indians to their rendezvous or\r\nheadquarters, they would be retained as hostages, probably for a long\r\nperiod, and be subject at any time to be tortured should a fit of\r\nvengeance seize their captors. They would not, however, make an attempt\r\nto escape unless there appeared a moral certainty of its successful\r\naccomplishment.\r\n\r\nThe third day arrived, and at dawn, after partaking of the usual\r\nbreakfast of raw antelope or other game, they started again on their\r\nmarch. They rode all day, with the usual stoppages for forage, and about\r\neight o'clock in the evening camped, supped, and lay down for the night,\r\nas before, after assigning the usual night-guards to the prisoners, who\r\nwere again bound together.\r\n\r\nGlazier, with the experience he had obtained in the South, and his\r\ncompanion, with his intimate knowledge of the plains, kept themselves\r\nconstantly on the alert, prepared to take advantage of any opportunity\r\nthat offered to escape from their captors. They had each fixed his eye\r\non a pony in the herd. These animals were turned out to graze with their\r\nsaddles on, in order that they might be ready for instant use, if\r\nrequired, in the night. The prisoners began snoring loudly under\r\npretence of being asleep, and at the same time the guards dozed and\r\nslept at intervals, but were restless until about midnight, when they\r\nboth succumbed and were fast asleep.\r\n\r\nGlazier now worked at the cord on his wrist, and found he could unfasten\r\nit. While so doing, one of the Indians moved in his sleep, and\r\nimmediately all was still as death with the captives. At length the\r\ntime had arrived, the complicated knot was loosened, and the noose\r\nslipped over his hand, which at once gave him and his partner liberty of\r\naction. They knew where the arms lay, and each in the twinkling of an\r\neye secured a large navy revolver without disturbing the Indians. They\r\nthen simultaneously struck the two sleeping guards a powerful blow on\r\nthe head with the butt of their revolvers. The Indian struck by the\r\nherder was nearly killed by the heavy blow, while Glazier's man was only\r\nstunned. They then made for the ponies, leaped into the saddles, and\r\nbefore any of the other Indians had shaken off their heavy slumber, had\r\nstruck out with all their might in the direction from which they had\r\ncome, and in the opposite one, therefore, to that in which the Indian\r\nparty were proceeding.\r\n\r\nIn a moment, however, the pursuit commenced in earnest; vociferations\r\nimplying vengeance of the direst character if they did not halt, were\r\nflung through the darkness, which only had the effect of spurring the\r\nfugitives to still greater speed. Glazier turned in his saddle and sent\r\na bullet among his pursuers in reply to their peremptory invitation to\r\nhim to halt. Another and another followed, and one Indian was\r\ndismounted, but the darkness prevented his seeing if his other shots had\r\ntold. The Indians meanwhile, who had plenty of ammunition, were not slow\r\nin returning the fire, but luckily without any worse result than to\r\nincrease the pace of the flying ponies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Escape From The Arrapahoes.]\r\n\r\nAway they tore at the top of their speed, and soon entered a canyon in\r\nthe mountain side. Only two or three of the Indians could now be seen in\r\npursuit, and the herder, saying it would be better for both if they\r\ntook different directions, at once struck off through a ravine to the\r\nright, and left Glazier alone. One Indian was observed to follow, but\r\nGlazier sent a bullet into the enemy's horse, and thus put a stop to\r\nfurther pursuit. The Indian now leveled his carbine at Glazier and\r\ndismounted him; and the latter's ammunition being exhausted, he ran off\r\ntowards a gulch, and leaping in, remained hidden until daylight. Finding\r\nthe coast clear in the morning, he emerged and at once set out walking\r\nin a southwesterly direction, which eventually brought him to a\r\ncattle-ranche, the owner of which supplied him with refreshment and a\r\nfresh mustang. Again turning his face to the west he pursued his way,\r\ncovering the ground between himself and the Golden Gate at the rate of\r\nsixty miles per day.\r\n\r\nOgden, in the northern extremity of Utah, about forty miles from Salt\r\nLake City, and five hundred and eleven from Cheyenne, was reached\r\nNovember thirteenth, after hard riding and sundry stoppages at ranches\r\nin quest of hospitality and information. No event occurred more exciting\r\nthan the shooting of a buffalo that crossed his path--this being the\r\nthird, beside sundry antelopes and several prairie wolves that had\r\nfallen to his revolver, in the course of his journey since leaving\r\nOmaha. On riding into Ogden, Captain Glazier was surprised to find it so\r\nimportant a city. It forms the western terminus of the Union Pacific,\r\nand the eastern terminus of the Central Pacific, railroads, and is the\r\nsecond city in size and population in the Territory of Utah. Besides the\r\nchurches, a Mormon tabernacle was noticed, the population being largely\r\nof the polygamic persuasion and yielding their allegiance to the prophet\r\nof Salt Lake City.\r\n\r\nOne peculiarity of the towns in these western territories is the running\r\nstreams of water on each side of nearly every street, which are fed by\r\nsome mountain stream and from which water is taken to irrigate the\r\ngardens and orchards adjoining the dwellings. Ogden has a bright future\r\nbefore it. It is not only the terminus of the two great\r\ntrans-continental lines before mentioned, but is also the starting-point\r\nof the Utah Central and Utah Northern railroads. Vast quantities of iron\r\nore can be obtained within five miles of the city, and in Ogden canyon\r\ndiscoveries of silver have been made. Fruit-growing is very common in\r\nthe vicinity, and a large quantity of the best varieties grown in the\r\nTerritory are produced around Ogden. Utah apples, peaches and pears are\r\nfiner in size, color and flavor than any grown in the Eastern or Middle\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nNovember eighteenth, Captain Glazier heard from his advance agent, Mr.\r\nWalter Montgomery, then in Sacramento, who was in ignorance of the\r\ncaptain's adventure among the Indians after leaving Cheyenne, except\r\nthat certain startling rumors had reached him of the captain having been\r\nkilled by the Sioux. Mr. Montgomery had accordingly written to various\r\npoints for information of the missing horseman; and to allay the fears\r\nof his numerous well-wishers, who were in doubt as to his safety,\r\nCaptain Glazier, after leaving Ogden, wrote the following summary of his\r\nadventure, addressed to his friend, Major E. M. Hessler, of Cleveland,\r\nOhio:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  Wild Cat Ranche,\r\n                                              In Ogden Canyon, Utah,\r\n                                             _November 18th, 1876_.\r\n\r\n     Major E. M. Hessler,\r\n            Cleveland, Ohio.\r\n\r\n     Dear Sir and Comrade: I learn through my advance agent Mr.\r\n     Montgomery, that a letter, manifesting some anxiety for my\r\n     welfare, was recently addressed to you. I hasten to say that I am\r\n     again in the saddle, and although for three days the guest of the\r\n     Arrapahoes, I am still in the best of spirits, and with even more\r\n     hair than when I left Cleveland. I should be pleased to give you a\r\n     detailed account of my adventures among the red-skins, but have\r\n     only time to tell you that I started from Cheyenne, October\r\n     twenty-eighth, accompanying two herders who were on their way to\r\n     Salt Lake City with a small drove of mustangs and Indian ponies. We\r\n     were attacked on the thirty-first of the same month by a straggling\r\n     band of Arrapahoes, near Skull Rocks, on the Laramie Plains. One\r\n     Indian was killed, and my companions and myself were made prisoners\r\n     after using up nearly all our ammunition in the effort to repulse\r\n     our assailants. The herder whose fire killed the Indian was\r\n     afterwards tied to a stake and most cruelly tortured to death.\r\n     Bound to my remaining companion with thongs, we were on the\r\n     following morning placed upon ponies and marched rapidly to the\r\n     northward.\r\n\r\n     Breaking away from our captors on the night of November second by\r\n     disabling two of our guards, we were followed some miles, firing\r\n     and receiving the fire of the Indians as we galloped off on two of\r\n     their ponies which we had appropriated. After being dismounted by a\r\n     shot, and dismounting the Indian who had killed my horse, I finally\r\n     eluded my pursuers by leaping into a gulch in the mountains, where\r\n     I remained until daylight, when, finding no Indians in sight, I\r\n     pursued my way on foot in a southwesterly direction, which brought\r\n     me to a cattle-ranche late in the afternoon. Here I secured a fresh\r\n     mustang, and once more turned my face toward the setting sun.\r\n\r\n     My money and personal effects were of course promptly taken\r\n     possession of by the Arrapahoes. I am now moving westward at an\r\n     average of over sixty miles per day, confidently expecting to reach\r\n     San Francisco by the twenty-fourth instant. In our encounter on the\r\n     Laramie Plains, five members of the \"Lo!\" family were sent to their\r\n     Happy Hunting Ground, and in the matter of scalps you may score at\r\n     least two for your humble servant.\r\n\r\n     With kind regards to friends in Cleveland, I close this letter to\r\n     mount my horse,\r\n\r\n             And remain, ever truly yours,\r\n                                                    Willard Glazier.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Glazier's main object now was to push on to Sacramento as fast\r\nas his mustang would carry him. Kelton (Utah), at the northwest corner\r\nof Salt Lake, was accordingly reached soon after leaving Ogden, where he\r\nhalted a few hours. This station is seven hundred and ninety miles from\r\nSan Francisco. Stock is extensively grazed in its vicinity, feeding on\r\nsage brush in the winter and such grass as they can get; but excellent\r\ngrazing is found in the summer. The cattle are shipped to markets on the\r\nPacific coast in large numbers. Terrace (Utah) was the next\r\nresting-place, seven hundred and fifty-seven miles from San Francisco,\r\nin the midst of a desert with all its dreary loneliness. Continuing his\r\npace at an average of eight miles per hour--the temperature being very\r\nlow at an elevation of nearly five thousand feet--Captain Glazier\r\nobserved a few only of the salient features of the wild country he now\r\npassed through, his position on horseback being less favorable for\r\ntopographical study than that of the tourist comfortably seated in a\r\npalace-car.\r\n\r\nWells (Nevada) was duly reached by the lonely rider, who found on\r\ninquiry that he was now only six hundred and sixty-one miles from his\r\ndestination. This place stands at an elevation of five thousand six\r\nhundred and twenty-nine feet. Humboldt Wells, as they are designated,\r\ngive celebrity to the place, which was a great watering-station in the\r\ndays of the old emigrant travel. The emigrants always rejoiced when they\r\nhad passed the perils of the Great American Desert and arrived at these\r\nsprings, where there was always plenty of pure water and an abundance of\r\ngrass for the weary animals. Hence it was a favorite camping-ground\r\nbefore the existence of the Pacific Railroad. The wells are very deep. A\r\nGovernment exploring party, under command of Lieutenant Cuppinger,\r\nvisited the spot in 1870, and took soundings to a depth of seventeen\r\nhundred feet without finding bottom.\r\n\r\nHalleck (Nevada) was the next resting station, at an elevation of five\r\nthousand two hundred and thirty feet. It is named from Camp Halleck,\r\nabout thirteen miles from the station, where two or three companies of\r\nUnited States troops are usually kept. The land around is mostly\r\noccupied as stock-ranges.\r\n\r\nElko (Nevada), twenty-four miles nearer his destination, supplied his\r\nwants in the way of rest and food for the night. This is the county-seat\r\nof Elko County, the northeastern county of the State. The town has a\r\npopulation of 1500, and is destined to become an important city. The\r\nmoney paid for freights consigned to this place and the mining districts\r\nwhich are tributary to it, averages $1,000,000 per year. There are\r\nnumerous retail stores, and a few wholesale establishments, with a bank,\r\nbrewery, hotels, and three large freight depots for the accommodation of\r\nthe railroad business. Indians, mostly the Shoshones, of both sexes, are\r\nfrequently noticed about the town.\r\n\r\nThe valley of the Humboldt continued to widen after leaving Elko--the\r\npastures and meadow lands, with occasional houses, were soon passed, and\r\nthe rider pushed on to Palisade (Nevada), his next halting-place, thirty\r\nmiles from Elko, and five hundred and seventy-six from San Francisco.\r\nFor the last two hundred miles the road had been a gradual descent, and\r\nthe change of temperature was very sensible. Palisade is a growing\r\nlittle place, with a population of about four hundred souls. The town is\r\nlocated about half way down a canyon, and the rocky, perpendicular walls\r\ngive it a picturesque appearance.\r\n\r\nForty-one miles farther west Captain Glazier stopped again for\r\nrefreshment and rest at Argenta (Nevada), in the midst of alkali flats.\r\nThe road continued for a few miles along the base of the Reese River\r\nMountain, when suddenly a broad valley opened out--the valley of the\r\nReese River. Turning to the right he found himself at Battle Mountain\r\n(Nevada), at the junction of the Reese River and Humboldt Valleys. The\r\ntown of Battle Mountain has several extensive stores, a public hall, an\r\nexcellent school-house and a first-class hotel, with a large and rapidly\r\nincreasing trade. Battle Mountain, about three miles south of the town,\r\nis reputed to have been the scene of a sanguinary conflict between a\r\nparty of emigrants and a band of red-skins, who were defeated.\r\n\r\nGolconda (Nevada) was reached, and is four hundred and seventy-eight\r\nmiles from San Francisco. It is a small place, with three or four\r\nstores, a hotel, and several houses. Gold Run mining district, a little\r\ndistance to the south, is tributary to the place. Having rested for the\r\nnight, Glazier mounted at sunrise and directed his course to Winnemucca\r\n(Nevada), the county-seat of Humboldt county, with a population of\r\nfifteen hundred, among whom are some Indians and not a few Chinamen. The\r\ntown has an elegant brick court-house, together with several stores,\r\nhotels, shops, and a school-house. _Winnemucca_ was the name of a chief\r\nof the Piute Indians, who was favorable to the whites at the time of the\r\nlaying out of the city.\r\n\r\nHumboldt (Nevada) was reached in due time--an oasis in the desert. Here\r\nhe was reminded that he was still in a land of cultivation and\r\ncivilization. The first growing trees since leaving Ogden were seen\r\nhere, with plenty of green grass and flowing fountains of pure water.\r\nHumboldt House offered its hospitality to our traveler, and the place\r\nand its surroundings reminded him of his home in the east. It was a\r\ngreat relief from the wearisome, dreary views which had everywhere met\r\nhis gaze over the largest part of his journey since leaving Omaha.\r\nHumboldt is the business centre of several valuable mining districts,\r\nand has a bright prospect in the future.\r\n\r\nThe following incident is said to have occurred in one of the Nevada\r\nmining towns not many miles from Humboldt:\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1852 or '53, on a still, hot summer afternoon, a certain\r\nman who shall be nameless, having tracked his two donkeys and one horse\r\na half mile and discovering that a man's track with spur marks followed\r\nthem, came back to town and told \"the boys,\" who loitered about a\r\npopular saloon, that in his opinion some Mexican had stolen the animals.\r\nSuch news as this demanded, naturally, drinks all around.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know, gentlemen,\" said one who assumed leadership, \"that just\r\nnaturally to shoot these greasers ain't the best way? Give 'em a fair\r\njury trial, and rope 'em up with all the majesty of the law. That's the\r\ncure.\"\r\n\r\nSuch words of moderation were well received, and they drank again to\r\n\"Here's hoping we may ketch that greaser!\"\r\n\r\nAs they loafed back to the veranda, a Mexican walked over the hill-brow,\r\njingling his spurs pleasantly in accord with a whistled waltz.\r\n\r\nThe advocate for the law said, in an undertone, \"That's the cuss!\"\r\n\r\nA rush, a struggle, and the Mexican, bound hand and foot, lay on his\r\nback in the bar-room. The miners turned out to a man.\r\n\r\nHappily, such cries as \"_String him up!_\" \"_Burn the dog-goned\r\nlubricator!_\" and other equally pleasant phrases fell unheeded upon his\r\nSpanish ear. A jury was quickly gathered in the street, and despite\r\nrefusals to serve, the crowd hurried them in behind the bar.\r\n\r\nA brief statement of the case was made by the advocate _pro tem._, and\r\nthey showed the jury into a commodious poker-room, where were seats\r\ngrouped about neat green tables. The noise outside in the bar-room\r\nby-and-by died away into complete silence, but from afar down the canyon\r\ncame confused sounds as of disorderly cheering. They came nearer, and\r\nagain the light-hearted noise of human laughter mingled with clinking\r\nglasses around the bar.\r\n\r\nA low knock at the jury door, the lock burst in, and a dozen smiling\r\nfellows asked the verdict. The foreman promptly answered, \"_Not\r\nguilty._\"\r\n\r\nWith volleys of oaths, and ominous laying of hands on pistol hilts, the\r\n\"boys\" slammed the door with--\"_You'll have to do better than that!_\"\r\n\r\nIn half an hour the advocate gently opened the door again.\r\n\r\n\"Your _opinion_, gentlemen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Guilty!\"\r\n\r\n\"Correct! you can come out. _We hung him an hour ago!_\"\r\n\r\nThe jury took their drinks, and when, after a few minutes, the pleasant\r\nvillage returned to its former tranquility, it was \"_allowed_\" at more\r\nthan one saloon that \"Mexicans'll know enough to let white men's stock\r\nalone after this.\" One and another exchanged the belief that this sort\r\nof thing was more sensible than \"nipping 'em on sight.\"\r\n\r\nWhen, before sunset, the bar-keeper concluded to sweep some dust out of\r\nhis poker-room back-door, he felt a momentary surprise at finding the\r\nmissing horse dozing under the shadow of an oak, and the two lost\r\ndonkeys serenely masticating playing-cards, of which many bushels lay in\r\na dirty pile. He was then reminded that the animals had been there all\r\nday!\r\n\r\nLovelocks (Nevada) is three hundred and eighty-nine miles from San\r\nFrancisco, and its elevation above the sea-level three thousand nine\r\nhundred and seventy-seven feet. It is simply a station, with a few\r\nbuildings connected with the Central Pacific Railroad; but is a fine\r\ngrazing region, and large herds of cattle are fattened here upon the\r\nrich native grasses. There is quite a settlement of farmers near\r\nLovelocks. Before the railroad came the pasture lands were renowned\r\namong the emigrants, who recruited their stock after the wearisome\r\njourney across the plains.\r\n\r\nLeaving Lovelocks, Captain Glazier soon found himself again on the\r\nbarren desert. A side track of the railroad, named White Plains, gave\r\nhim rest for the night. The spot is surrounded by a white alkali desert,\r\ncovered in places with salt and alkali deposits. Hot Springs is another\r\nstation in the midst of the desert, and is so named from the hot springs\r\nwhose rising steam can be seen about half a mile from the station.\r\n\r\nHastening forward he reached Desert (Nevada), which he found to be three\r\nhundred and thirty-five miles from San Francisco, and that the place is\r\nrightly named. The winds that sweep the barren plains here, heap the\r\nsand around the scattered sage brush till they resemble huge potato\r\nhills--a most dreary place.\r\n\r\nThe captain found it quite a relief on reaching Wadsworth (Nevada), a\r\ntown of about five hundred souls, and three hundred and twenty-eight\r\nmiles from the end of his journey. It has several large stores,\r\nChinamen's houses, and hotels, in one of the latter of which he found\r\nrefreshment and a bed. His route had been for several days across\r\ndreary, monotonous plains, with nothing but black desolation around him.\r\nAnother world now opened to his view--a world of beauty, grandeur and\r\nsublimity. Reluctantly leaving this agreeable place, he crossed the\r\nTruckee River, and gazed with delightful sensations upon the trees, the\r\ngreen meadows, comfortable farm-houses and well-tilled fields of the\r\nranches, as he rode forward.\r\n\r\nHe had now crossed the boundary line that divides Nevada from\r\nCalifornia, and Truckee was the first place he halted at. This is a\r\nflourishing little city of fifteen hundred inhabitants, one-third of\r\nwhom are Chinese, and is two hundred and fifty-nine miles from San\r\nFrancisco. A large number of good stores were seen here, and a\r\nconsiderable trade is carried on.\r\n\r\nHe next reached Summit (California). From this point the road descends\r\nrapidly to the Valley of the Sacramento.\r\n\r\nSeveral intermediate places having been stopped at, in which our\r\ntraveler obtained accommodation for a night, we hasten on with him to\r\nSacramento, where, on November twenty-first, he found himself again\r\nsurrounded with all the appliances of civilization. Sacramento has a\r\npopulation of twenty-five thousand. The broad streets are shaded by\r\nheavy foliage. It is a city of beautiful homes. Lovely cottages are\r\nsurrounded by flowers, fruits and vines; while some of the most elegant\r\nmansions in the State are in the midst of grassy lawns, or gardens\r\nfilled with the rarest flowers. Here is the State capitol, a building\r\nthat cost nearly $2,500,000 for its erection. Sacramento is an important\r\nrailroad centre, second only to San Francisco.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Captain Glazier Riding Into The Pacific--near\r\nThe Cliff House, San Francisco.]\r\n\r\nBrighton was one hundred and thirty-four miles from the termination of\r\nhis ride. At the farm-houses along the road numerous wind-mills were\r\nseen. These are used to fill reservoirs for household wants, and are\r\ncommon in all the valleys and plains of California.\r\n\r\nA halt was made at Stockton, twenty-one miles from destination. This\r\ncity has a population of about fifteen thousand, and is only\r\ntwenty-three feet above the level of the sea. It was named to\r\ncommemorate Commodore Stockton's part in the conquest of California.\r\n\r\nUsing all despatch, Captain Glazier pushed on to San Francisco, and\r\nentered the city November twenty-fourth, registering at the Palace\r\nHotel. He immediately after rode, in company with Mr. Walter Montgomery,\r\nand a friend, to the Cliff House, reaching it by the toll-road. This\r\nbeautiful seaside resort is built on a prominence overlooking the ocean.\r\nCaptain Glazier walked his horse into the waters of the Pacific, and\r\nthen felt that he had accomplished his task. He had ridden in the saddle\r\nfrom the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean--from Boston to San Francisco--a\r\ndistance of four thousand one hundred and thirty-three miles, in just\r\ntwo hundred days.\r\n\r\nHe was now no longer the slave of duty, and would rest for a few days\r\nand see the beautiful city before he returned to the east. He wandered\r\nabout, mostly on foot, visited and inspected the numerous public\r\nbuildings, the City Park, Woodward's Gardens, etc., and became convinced\r\nfrom personal observation of the greatness and magnificence of this city\r\non the Pacific, with its three hundred thousand inhabitants, covering a\r\nterritory of forty-two square miles, and the growth of less than thirty\r\nyears. On its eastern front San Francisco extends along the bay, whose\r\nname it bears, bounded on the north by the Golden Gate, and on the west\r\nwashed by the Pacific Ocean along a beach five or six miles in extent.\r\nIt is not, however, a part of our plan to describe this wonderful city,\r\nwhich has been done most effectively by others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nRETURN FROM CALIFORNIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Returns to the East by the \"Iron Horse.\"--Boston _Transcript_ on\r\n    the journey on horseback.--Resumes literary work.--\"Peculiarities\r\n    of American Cities.\"--Preface to book.--A domestic incident.--A\r\n    worthy son.--Claims of parents.--Purchases the old Homestead, and\r\n    presents it to his father and mother.--Letter to his parents.\r\n\r\nWe now accompany our subject on his return journey to the east. His\r\nfamily and friends had naturally felt great concern for him during his\r\nlong and perilous ride, and he was anxious therefore to allay their\r\nfears for his safety by presenting himself before them. He accordingly\r\npurchased a ticket and left San Francisco by rail on the twenty-eighth\r\nof November, and after a journey more rapid and comfortable than the one\r\nhe had made on horseback, arrived in New York city on December sixth.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the eastern papers, on hearing of the captain's safe return,\r\nfurnished their readers with interesting, and, more or less, correct\r\naccounts of the journey. We can find room only for that of the Boston\r\n_Transcript_:\r\n\r\n     \"It will be remembered that on the ninth of May, 1876, Captain\r\n     Willard Glazier, the author of 'Battles for the Union,' and other\r\n     works of a military character, rode out of Boston with the\r\n     intention of crossing the continent on horseback. His object in\r\n     undertaking this long and tedious journey was to study at\r\n     comparative leisure the line of country which he traversed, and the\r\n     habits and condition of the people he came in contact with, the\r\n     industrious and peaceful white, and the 'noble' and belligerent\r\n     red. According to the captain's note-book, he had a closer\r\n     opportunity of studying the characteristics of the _terror_ than\r\n     the toiler of the plains.\r\n\r\n     \"Accompanied by certain members of the 'Grand Army of the\r\n     Republic,' on the morning of May ninth, as far as Brighton, he\r\n     there took leave of them, and with one companion, rode as far as\r\n     Albany, the captain lecturing by the way wherever inducement\r\n     offered, and handing over the profits to the benefit of the Widows'\r\n     and Orphans' Fund of the G. A. R. Many of these lectures were well\r\n     attended, and the receipts large, as letters of thanks from the\r\n     various 'Posts' testify.\r\n\r\n     \"From Albany Captain Glazier pursued his journey alone, and rode\r\n     the same horse through the States of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio,\r\n     Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, and Nebraska, as far as Omaha.\r\n     Thence he proceeded on whatever quadruped of the equine species he\r\n     could obtain, which was capable of shaking the dust from its feet\r\n     nimbly. That he was fortunate in this respect is proven by the fact\r\n     that he rode from Omaha to San Francisco, a distance of nineteen\r\n     hundred and eighty-eight miles in thirty days, making an average of\r\n     about sixty-seven miles per diem. The distance from Omaha to\r\n     Cheyenne, five hundred and twenty-two miles, he accomplished in six\r\n     days; the greatest distance accomplished in one day of fourteen\r\n     hours was one hundred and sixty-six miles, three mustangs being\r\n     called into requisition for the purpose. The entire time occupied\r\n     by the journey was two hundred days, the captain reaching the\r\n     Golden Gate on the twenty-fourth day of November. The actual number\r\n     of days in the saddle was one hundred and forty-four, which gives\r\n     an average of twenty-eight miles and seven-tenths per day.\r\n\r\n     \"During this strange journey of more than four thousand miles,\r\n     Captain Glazier delivered one hundred and four lectures for the\r\n     object before mentioned, and also for the benefit of the Custer\r\n     Monument Fund, and visited six hundred and forty-eight cities,\r\n     villages and stations. He tested the merits of three hundred and\r\n     thirty-three hotels, farm-houses and ranches, and made special\r\n     visits to over one hundred public institutions and places of\r\n     resort. He killed three buffaloes, eight antelopes, and twenty-two\r\n     prairie wolves, thus enjoying to the full all the pleasurable\r\n     excitement of hunting on the plains.\r\n\r\n     \"But on the thirty-first of October, while in the company of two\r\n     herders, the tables were turned, and a band of hostile Arrapahoes\r\n     suddenly disturbed the harmony of the occasion. After a lively\r\n     encounter, in which one of the Indians was despatched to the Happy\r\n     Hunting Grounds, Glazier and his companions were taken prisoners,\r\n     and one of the herders was gradually tortured to death. All that\r\n     now seemed to be required of the two survivors was patience--if\r\n     they desired to share a similar fate. But in the early morning of\r\n     the second of November, while their captors were asleep, they\r\n     contrived not only to escape, but to secure the arms which had been\r\n     taken from them; and, mounted on two mustangs belonging to the\r\n     Indians, soon placed a considerable distance between themselves and\r\n     their too confident guards. In the chase which ensued, Captain\r\n     Glazier was separated from his fellow-fugitive, and made good his\r\n     own escape by dismounting two of his pursuers, and eventually,\r\n     after a long, hard gallop, dismounting himself and hiding in a\r\n     gulch. What the fate of the herder was he had no means of\r\n     discovering.\r\n\r\n     \"Though a man of usually robust constitution, Captain Glazier felt\r\n     the transitions of climate acutely, but he experiences no ill\r\n     effects from the long journey now that it is over. The 'iron horse'\r\n     brought him back to the East of this continent in a few days, and\r\n     there are probably few men in the States who have formed a higher\r\n     opinion of the blessings of steam, than Captain Willard Glazier.\"\r\n\r\nReturned to Washington our soldier-author applied himself again to\r\nliterature, his ever active brain having been sufficiently recruited by\r\nthe comparative relaxation it had enjoyed during the long ride. One of\r\nthe fruits of his pen at this time was a volume entitled \"Peculiarities\r\nof American Cities,\" a subject upon which his flowing pen expatiates\r\nwith great freedom and a nice discrimination. That the reader may\r\nperceive the bent of Glazier's mind at this period of his history, we\r\nhere present the brief and succinct preface to that work:\r\n\r\n\"It has occurred to the author very often,\" he writes, \"that a volume\r\npresenting the peculiar features, favorite resorts, and distinguishing\r\ncharacteristics of the leading cities of America, would prove of\r\ninterest to thousands who could, at best, see them only in imagination;\r\nand to others who, having visited them, would like to compare notes with\r\none who has made their peculiarities a study for many years.\r\n\r\n\"A residence in more than a hundred cities, including nearly all that\r\nare introduced in this work, leads me to feel that I shall succeed in my\r\npurpose of giving to the public a book, without the necessity of\r\nmarching in slow, and solemn procession before my readers, a monumental\r\narray of time-honored statistics; on the contrary it will be my aim in\r\nthe following pages to talk of cities as I have seen and found them in\r\nmy walks from day to day, with but slight reference to their origin and\r\nhistory.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe will bring this chapter to a close by recording one incident in the\r\nlife of its hero, which, humble and common-place as it may be deemed by\r\nsome, is one which, in the judgment of a majority of our readers we\r\nventure to think, reflects glory upon Willard Glazier as a son, and the\r\nnation may well feel proud that can rear many such sons.\r\n\r\nA subject of great domestic interest which had occupied his thoughts for\r\na considerable period, but to which he had, in his busy life, been\r\nunable hitherto to give the necessary time and attention, at this time\r\nagain forcibly presented itself to his mind. Glazier's sense of a son's\r\nduty to his parents was not of the ordinary type. He was profoundly\r\nconscious of the moral obligation that devolved upon him, to render the\r\ndeclining years of his parents as free from discomfort and anxiety as it\r\nwas within his power to do. They had nursed and trained him in infancy\r\nand boyhood; had set before him daily the example of an upright life,\r\nand had instilled in him a love of truth, honesty and every manly\r\nvirtue. Their claim upon him, now that he had met with a measure of\r\nsuccess in life, was not to be ignored, and to a good father and a good\r\nmother he would, so far as he was able, endeavor to prove himself a good\r\nson.\r\n\r\nThe Old Homestead near the banks of the Oswegatchie, in St. Lawrence\r\nCounty, New York, where his parents still resided; where all their\r\nchildren had been born, and where many happy years had been passed, was\r\nnot the property of the Glazier family, and there was a possibility that\r\nthe \"dear old folks\" might in time have to remove from it. The thought\r\nof such a contingency was painful to Willard Glazier. It was the spot of\r\nall others around which his affections clung, and he resolved to make a\r\nstrenuous endeavor to possess himself of it, so that his father and\r\nmother might pass their remaining days under its shelter.\r\n\r\nHe accordingly opened negotiations with the owners of the property for\r\nthe purchase of the Homestead, and was soon rejoiced to find himself the\r\nsole proprietor of a place endeared to him by so many associations.\r\n\r\nThe following letter to his parents will form a fitting conclusion to\r\nthis chapter:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 102 Waverley Place,\r\n                       New York, _May 1st, 1878_.\r\n\r\n     My Dear Father and Mother:\r\n\r\n     I am just in receipt of the papers which place me in possession of\r\n     the _Old Homestead_. This, I am sure, will be very pleasing news to\r\n     you, since it is my intention to make it the home of your declining\r\n     years: poor old grandmother, too, shall find it a welcome refuge\r\n     while she lives. I have never felt that I could see the home of my\r\n     birth pass to other hands; my heart still clings to it, and its\r\n     hallowed associations, with all the tenacity of former days. The\r\n     first of May will, in future, have special charms for me, for from\r\n     this day, 1878, dates my claim to that spot of earth which to me is\r\n     dearer than all others.\r\n\r\n     Imagination often takes me back to the Old House on the Hill, where\r\n     your children spent many of the happiest hours of their childhood\r\n     and youth. In fancy I again visit the scenes of my boyhood--again\r\n     chase the butterfly, and pick the dandelion with Elvira and\r\n     Marjorie in the shade of the wide-spreading elms.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     I have been working for you, dear parents, in the face of great\r\n     obstacles since the close of the war. If you think I have neglected\r\n     you--have not been home in ten long years, then I reply, I did not\r\n     wish to see you again until I could place you beyond the reach of\r\n     want. _One of the objects of my life is to-day accomplished:_ and\r\n     now, with love to all, and the fervent hope that prosperity and\r\n     happiness may wait upon you for many, many years to come,\r\n\r\n                                           I remain, always,\r\n                                          Your most affectionate son,\r\n                                                               Willard.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Headwaters Of The Mississippi.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MISSISSIPPI RIVER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  An interval of literary work.--Conception of another\r\n    expedition.--Reflections upon the Old Explorers.--Indian\r\n    rumors.--Determined to find the true source of the Great\r\n    River.--Starting on the eventful journey.--Joined by his brother\r\n    George and Barrett Channing Paine.--Collecting materials for the\r\n    expedition.--Brainerd the first point of departure.--Through the\r\n    Chippewa Country.--Seventy miles of government road.--Curiosity\r\n    its own reward.--Arrival at Leech Lake.\r\n\r\nAn interval of three years, from 1878 to 1881, now elapsed in the career\r\nof Captain Glazier; years of retirement from public attention, but by no\r\nmeans of inactivity on his part. During this period he was engaged\r\nmainly in literary work, and in preparation for a forthcoming expedition\r\nwhich his ever restless brain had evolved, and which, if successful,\r\nwould furnish a valuable contribution to the geography of North America.\r\n\r\nThe design of the expedition was no less than the discovery of the true\r\nsource of the \"Father of Waters,\" the mighty Mississippi; and a voyage\r\nthence, in a canoe, to its mouth in the Gulf of Mexico. It was a novel\r\nand daring project.\r\n\r\nThe idea of such an undertaking had occurred to him while on his\r\nhorseback journey across the continent; of which a brief outline has\r\nbeen given the reader in previous chapters. He had come to a point in\r\nhis onward progress which is noted for its beauty, being one of the most\r\npicturesque spots on the Mississippi, the bridge spanning the river\r\nbetween Iowa and Illinois, where the rock-divided stream flows grandly\r\nby under the shadow of towering bluffs. His own words best describe the\r\nimpression which the scene made upon him, and the consequent birth in\r\nhis brain of the most notable achievement of his life:--\r\n\r\n\"While crossing the continent on horseback from ocean to ocean, in 1876,\r\nI came to a bridge which spans the Mississippi between Rock Island,\r\nIllinois, and Davenport, Iowa. As I saw the flood of this mighty stream\r\nrolling beneath me, I turned in imagination to its discovery in 1541. I\r\nsaw the renowned De Soto upon its banks and buried in its depths: I\r\naccompanied Marquette from the mouth of the Wisconsin to the mouth of\r\nthe Arkansas: I followed Father Hennepin northward to St. Anthony's\r\nFalls: and I saw the daring La Salle plant the banner of France on the\r\nshores of the Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\n\"Musing thus upon the exploits of the heroic old explorers who led the\r\nway to this grand and peerless river of North America, I felt that it\r\nwas a subject of much regret that although its mouth was discovered by\r\nthe Chevalier La Salle nearly two hundred years ago, there was still\r\nmuch uncertainty as to its true source. Within the last century several\r\ndistinguished explorers have attempted to find the primal reservoir of\r\nthe Great River. Beltrami, Nicollett, and Schoolcraft have each in turn\r\nclaimed the goal of their explorations. Numerous lakes, ponds, and\r\nrivers have from time to time enjoyed the honor of standing at the head\r\nof the 'Father of Waters.' Schoolcraft, finally, in 1832, decided upon\r\na lake, which he named Itasca, as the fountain-head, and succeeded in\r\nsecuring for it the recognition of geographers and map-makers.\r\n\r\n\"Notwithstanding the fact, however, that the claim for geographical\r\nhonors was very generally accorded to Schoolcraft's lake, as being the\r\nsource of the Mississippi, I had frequently been told that many Indians\r\ndenied that their ideal river began its course in Lake Itasca, and\r\nasserted that there were other lakes and rivers above and beyond that\r\nlake, unknown to the white man, and that in them was to be found the\r\noriginal starting forth of the mysterious stream. These reflections led\r\nme to conclude that there was yet a rich field for exploration in the\r\nwilds of Minnesota.\"\r\n\r\nThus it was that Captain Glazier determined upon a search for this great\r\nunknown of waters. The time, however, was not yet ripe for the\r\nfulfilment of his purpose. There was promised work to be done, duties to\r\nthe public waiting to be fulfilled, various literary responsibilities\r\naccumulated from the past which must be met, the projected undertaking\r\nitself to be specially prepared for;--all this to be done before he\r\ncould finally turn his face towards his new purpose.\r\n\r\nThe intervening period was therefore occupied in carefully revising his\r\nliterary productions. Several of his books, written hastily at the close\r\nof the war, had been published in rapid succession in a somewhat\r\nincomplete form, and the constantly increasing demand for their\r\nsubsequent editions brought a public pressure to bear upon him for their\r\nneeded revision which could not well be resisted.\r\n\r\nHe had also other forthcoming works on his hands, which he was anxious\r\nshould be put into form before he again launched himself upon the sea\r\nof uncertain ventures. In order to collect additional material for his\r\nbook upon the \"Peculiarities of American Cities\" it was necessary that\r\nhe should make an extensive traveling tour; consequently, a considerable\r\nportion of this time was spent in visiting the leading cities of the\r\nUnited States and Canada. Adding to all this the necessary preparatory\r\nlabor attending his contemplated voyage in search of the true source of\r\nthe Mississippi, and it will be seen that the years elapsing between his\r\njourney from ocean to ocean and his latest expedition were actively and\r\nwell employed.\r\n\r\nAt length, however, all his tasks were accomplished, and the month of\r\nMay, 1881, found him stopping for a few days at Cleveland, Ohio, in his\r\njourney westward from New York. Leaving Cleveland on the first day of\r\nJune, he proceeded to Chicago, and without further tarrying went from\r\nthat city directly to St. Paul, Minnesota, intending to make this the\r\nfirst point for gathering his forces and collecting the material needed\r\nfor his coming exploration. Here he was joined by his brother George and\r\nBarrett Channing Paine, of Indianapolis, Indiana. The month of June was\r\nspent at St. Paul in collecting tents, blankets, guns, ammunition,\r\nfishing tackle and all the various paraphernalia necessary for a six\r\nweeks' sojourn in the northern wilderness.\r\n\r\nFinally, all arrangements being completed, the party left St. Paul on\r\nthe morning of July the fourth, to go to Brainerd, about a hundred miles\r\nabove St. Paul, which was to be the point of immediate departure for\r\nLeech Lake and thence to Lake Itasca. Brief stoppages were made at\r\nMinneapolis, Monticello, St. Cloud and Little Falls on their way up the\r\nriver, until Brainerd was reached July the seventh.\r\n\r\nBrainerd is an enterprising little village at the point where the\r\nNorthern Pacific Railroad crosses the Mississippi, near the boundary of\r\nthe Chippewa Indian Reservation, and is the nearest point, of any\r\nconsequence, to Lake Itasca. Here Captain Glazier stopped for some days\r\nthat he might further inform himself upon the topography of the country,\r\nin order to decide on the most feasible route to his destination, and\r\nalso to provide such supplies of food as were necessary. After\r\nconsulting maps it was concluded that although Schoolcraft and others\r\nhad found Itasca by going up the river through Lakes Winnibegoshish,\r\nCass and Bemidji, the most direct course would be by way of Leech Lake\r\nand the Kabekanka River. It was therefore decided to take wagon\r\nconveyance to Leech Lake over what is known in Northern Minnesota as the\r\nGovernment Road. This road stretches for seventy miles through trackless\r\npine forests and almost impenetrable underbrush, the only habitations to\r\nbe seen along its line being the half-way houses erected for the\r\naccommodation of teamsters, who are engaged in hauling government\r\nsupplies, and the occasional wigwams of wandering Indians. It was opened\r\nin 1856, by James Macaboy, for the convenience of Indian agents and the\r\nfur trade.\r\n\r\nAt length, at eight o'clock on the bright, summer morning of Tuesday,\r\nJuly the twelfth, Captain Glazier and his companions, fully equipped,\r\nand with a driver celebrated for his knowledge of frontier life, began\r\ntheir long and toilsome wagon journey. A ride of between three and four\r\nhours brought them to Gull Lake, where a halt was proposed and made for\r\nrest and refreshment.\r\n\r\nThis lake was for many years the home and headquarters of the noted\r\nChippewa chief, Hole-in-the-day, and has been the scene of many\r\nsanguinary struggles between his braves and those of the equally noted\r\nSioux chief, Little Crow. The ruins of a block-house, remains of\r\nwigwams, and a few scattered graves are all that is now left to tell the\r\nstory of its aboriginal conflicts. A family of four persons living in a\r\nlog-house form the white population of the place. Reuben Gray, the\r\ngenial patriarch who presides over this solitary household in the\r\nwilderness, delights in the title of landlord, and his hotel (by\r\ncourtesy) has become somewhat famous as one of the pioneer half-way\r\nhouses between Brainerd and Leech Lake.\r\n\r\nAfter resting for a while and doing ample justice to the appetizing\r\ndinner which was set before them, our travelers resumed their journey.\r\nPine River was their evening destination, and at five o'clock they\r\nreached the ranche of George Barclay, the only white habitation to be\r\nfound between their last resting-place and Leech Lake. Here they were\r\nmost agreeably surprised to find very good accommodation for both man\r\nand beast.\r\n\r\nAn excellent breakfast the next morning, with the fair prospect of\r\nreaching by evening the first terminal point of their journey, put the\r\ntravelers in exuberant spirits for the day, and nothing but jolting over\r\none of the roughest roads ever encountered by them could have lessened\r\ntheir enjoyment of the occasion. A short stop was made for luncheon at\r\nFourteen Mile Lake, and this being their first meal in the open air they\r\nwere enabled, together with the experience thus far gained in their\r\njourneying, to gauge more accurately their supply of rations. It was\r\nreadily discovered that they would need at least a third more\r\nprovisions for their expedition than would be required for the ordinary\r\noccupations of in-door life; and it was at once decided to provide an\r\nadditional supply of bacon and dried meats before leaving Leech Lake.\r\n\r\nAfter luncheon the Captain's brother and Mr. Paine took a bath in the\r\nlake, while he himself found amusement in duck-shooting and in chatting\r\nwith some straggling Chippewas, who were about launching their canoes\r\nfor a six weeks' hunting and fishing excursion. It happened that Captain\r\nGlazier had never before seen birch bark canoes, and they were therefore\r\nregarded by him with considerable interest, their use in the future\r\nbeing indispensable to the success of his undertaking. Now the Captain\r\npossesses, in common with most men of adventurous spirit, a\r\ncharacteristic desire to get at the bottom facts of everything, and this\r\ncuriosity here caused him a laughable mishap; for, the better to examine\r\nit, he stepped into one of the canoes, when, from want of experience in\r\nbalancing himself in so light a vessel, he was precipitated into the\r\nlake, much to his own discomfort but greatly to the amusement of the\r\nspectators.\r\n\r\nFirmly resolved upon more caution in the future, the Captain and his\r\ncompanions pursued their journey towards Leech Lake, which was reached\r\nat four o'clock in the afternoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOME OF THE CHIPPEWAS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  An embryonic red man.--A primitive hotel.--An unkempt inhabitant of\r\n    the forest.--Leech Lake.--Major Ruffe's arrival.--White\r\n    Cloud.--Paul Beaulieu and his theory about the source of the\r\n    Mississippi.--Che-no-wa-ge-sic.--Studying Indian manners and\r\n    customs.--Dining with Indian royalty.--Chippewa hospitality.--How\r\n    the wife of an Indian Chief entertains.--Souvenir of Flat\r\n    Mouth.--Return of Che-no-wa-ge-sic.--A council held.--An Indian\r\n    speech.--\"No White Man has yet seen the head of the Father of\r\n    Waters.\"--Voyage of exploration.--Launching the canoes.\r\n\r\nUpon the arrival of the travelers at Leech Lake their first glimpse of\r\nthe embryonic red man was a little fellow of about six years, who ran\r\nout of a wigwam, brandishing a bow in one hand, and carrying arrows in\r\nthe other. He was very far from being warlike, however, for with the\r\nfirst glance at his white brothers he suddenly disappeared in the\r\nbushes. A little further on they came to a log-cabin, over the door of\r\nwhich was nailed a primitive pine board, bearing the inscription--\"Hotel.\"\r\n\r\nHere they were received by a rough-looking man with long hair and\r\nunkempt beard, wearing, besides one other garment, a pair of pants made\r\nfrom a red blanket. The surroundings were certainly not inviting, and a\r\ncloser inspection of the squalid accommodation did not lead them to form\r\nany more favorable opinion. However, travelers cannot always be\r\nchoosers, and they really fared much better than they had expected,\r\ndining very agreeably on fresh fish and vegetables; breakfast the next\r\nmorning being selected from the same simple bill of fare, varied only by\r\nthe addition of \"flap-jacks.\" In default of habitable beds their\r\nhammocks were swung from the rafters of the loft.\r\n\r\nLeech Lake is one of the most irregularly shaped bodies of water that\r\ncan be imagined. It has no well-defined form, being neither oval nor\r\ncircular, but rather a combination of curves and varied outlines made by\r\npeninsulas and bays, of which only a map could convey any accurate idea.\r\nTen islands are found upon its surface, and seven rivers and creeks\r\nenter it from various directions. It extends not less than twenty miles\r\nfrom North to South, and a still greater distance from East to West,\r\nwith a coast line of over four hundred miles. It was for many years the\r\nseat of the Chippewa Indian Agency, but is now consolidated with the\r\nWhite Earth and Red Lake agencies. Major C. A. Ruffe is at present agent\r\nof the three departments, with headquarters at White Earth. The village\r\nconsists of some half dozen government buildings, as many log-cabins,\r\nand about twenty or thirty wigwams scattered here and there along the\r\nshore of one of the arms of the lake.\r\n\r\nThe day after the arrival of Captain Glazier's party, the agency was\r\nthrown into a state of excitement by the announcement that Major Ruffe\r\nwas on his way to Lake Winnibegoshish by way of Leech Lake. The Major\r\ncame the next day, accompanied by Captain Taylor of St. Cloud, one of\r\nthe pioneer surveyors of Minnesota; Paul Beaulieu, the veteran\r\ngovernment interpreter, and White Cloud, the present chief of the\r\nMississippi Indians, who succeeded Hole-in-the-day, the latter having\r\nbeen killed some time before by one of the Leech Lake band.\r\n\r\nPaul Beaulieu, the half-breed interpreter to Major Ruffe, possesses a\r\nfund of information concerning the Upper Mississippi which cannot be\r\nignored by those who are in pursuit of its mysterious source, and\r\nCaptain Glazier considered himself most fortunate in meeting him before\r\nhis departure for Lake Itasca. Beaulieu deserves more than a passing\r\nmention, as he is a man of wide experience, and is well known throughout\r\nMinnesota, and, in some circles, throughout the country. He was born at\r\nMackinaw, while General Sibley was stationed there in the interest of\r\nthe American Fur Company, of which John Jacob Astor was then the head.\r\nHis father was a Frenchman and his mother an Indian. He received an\r\nEnglish education, partly in the government school of Mackinaw, and\r\npartly at Montreal. On leaving school he was employed by the Fur\r\nCompany, and sent all over the United States from the St. Lawrence to\r\nLower California. He crossed the continent with the Stevens party on the\r\nfirst Northern Pacific survey, and rendered such valuable services that\r\nhe was presented with a testimonial in recognition of his efficiency.\r\n\r\nBeaulieu had a theory of his own regarding the source of the\r\nMississippi, based upon the stories of the Chippewas and other Indians\r\nof his acquaintance. In conversation with Captain Glazier upon the\r\nsubject he said that to the west of Lake Itasca there was another lake,\r\nthe outlet of which united with the stream from the former, and which\r\ncontributed a much larger volume of water at its junction with the\r\nMississippi than the outlet of Lake Itasca. He therefore assumed that\r\nthis nameless and almost unknown lake was the true source of the\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\nIn corroboration of the Beaulieu theory Major Ruffe said that he had\r\nheard the same opinion expressed by a number of old and reliable Indian\r\nvoyagers. It will thus be seen that there was a great diversity of\r\nsentiment among the most trustworthy authorities as to the actual source\r\nof the Great River.\r\n\r\nCaptain Glazier was greatly exercised on finding that his arrival at\r\nLeech Lake was at a season when the local band of Indians, the\r\nPillagers, as they are called, were away upon their annual hunting and\r\nfishing excursion. Their absence from the agency was a serious obstacle\r\nin the way of immediate further progress, for the reason that, being\r\ncompelled to take the final step in their expedition to the source of\r\nthe Mississippi from this point, it was important that they should\r\ncomplete their equipment by securing an interpreter, reliable guides and\r\nbirch bark canoes.\r\n\r\n\"Find Rev. Edwin Benedict as soon as you reach Leech Lake\" was the last\r\ninjunction Captain Glazier received on leaving Brainerd. Mr. Benedict is\r\nPost Missionary, and one of the five representatives of the Episcopal\r\nChurch on the Chippewa Reservation, holding his commission from Bishop\r\nWhipple of Minnesota. With this genial gentleman, Captain Glazier spent\r\nthe greater part of his time while waiting at the Agency, when not\r\nengaged in preparations for the voyage. The courtesy of a semi-civilized\r\nbed, and the convenience of a table, with pens, ink and paper, were\r\nluxuries to be appreciated and not readily forgotten.\r\n\r\nConversations with Mr. Benedict and with Flat Mouth, chief of the\r\nChippewas, developed the unexpected fact that there was but one Indian\r\nin the Chippewa country who had actually traversed the region which the\r\nCaptain and his party were about to explore, and that he was then\r\nvisiting some friends near Lake Winnibegoshish, and was not expected to\r\nreturn until the following Saturday, some three days off.\r\n\r\nSatisfied that Che-no-wa-ge-sic, the Chippewa brave referred to, would\r\nprove indispensable to the success of his expedition, Captain Glazier\r\ndecided to await his return to the Agency. While thus detained the\r\nCaptain and his friends found themselves indebted to Major Ruffe for his\r\nuntiring efforts to relieve the monotony of their sojourn, and to render\r\ntheir condition as agreeable as possible while within his sovereign\r\nborders.\r\n\r\nAs an important part of Captain Glazier's purpose in his Mississippi\r\nexpedition was to study the manners and customs of the people in the\r\nseveral portions of the country along its banks, he took advantage of\r\nhis present detention to inquire into the habits and traits of the\r\nIndians with whom he now came in daily contact. Some extracts from his\r\nprivate diary, graphically portraying the characteristics which\r\nimpressed him, are here especially interesting, as evidence of a certain\r\npower of philosophic reflection and inductive reasoning unusual in the\r\nmind of one so given to the excitement of an active, enterprising life\r\nas was Captain Glazier, who as soldier, author, and explorer certainly\r\nallowed himself little rest for the quiet abstractions of the student.\r\n\r\n\"Through conversations with Major Ruffe I learned much of the pioneer\r\nhistory of the post, and the attempts to civilize the Pillagers, as the\r\nLeech Lake Indians are named. This band appears to have separated from\r\nthe other Chippewas at an early day, and to have taken upon themselves\r\nthe duty of defending this portion of the Chippewa frontier. They\r\n'passed armed before their brethren' in their march westward. Their\r\ngeographical position was one which required them to assume great\r\nresponsibilities, and in the defence of their chosen frontier they have\r\ndistinguished themselves as brave and active warriors. Many acts of\r\nintrepidity are related of them which would be recorded with admiration\r\nhad white men been the actors. Perfectly versed in the arts of the\r\nforest they have gained many victories over that powerful assemblage of\r\ntribes known as the Sioux. With fewer numbers the Chippewas have never\r\nhesitated to fall upon their enemies, and have defeated and routed them\r\nwith a valor and resolution which in any period of written warfare would\r\nhave been stamped as heroic.\r\n\r\n\"It is not easy on the part of the government to repress the feelings of\r\nhostility which have so long existed between the respective tribes, and\r\nto convince them that they have lived into an age when milder maxims\r\nfurnish the basis of wise action....\r\n\r\n\"The domestic manners and habits of a people whose position is so\r\nadverse to improvement could hardly be expected to present anything\r\nstrikingly different from other erratic bands of the Northwest. There is\r\nindeed a remarkable conformity in the external habits of all our\r\nNorthern Indians. The necessity of changing their camps often to procure\r\ngame or fish, the want of domestic animals, the general dependence on\r\nwild rice, and the custom of journeying in canoes has produced a general\r\nuniformity of life, and it is emphatically a life of want and\r\nvicissitude. There is a perpetual change between action and inanity in\r\nthe mind which is a striking peculiarity of the savage state, and there\r\nis such a general want of forecast that most of their misfortunes and\r\nhardships, in war and peace, come unexpectedly.\"...\r\n\r\nOur explorers were agreeably surprised one day during their stay at\r\nLeech Lake by an invitation from Flat Mouth, the present ruler of the\r\nPillagers, to take dinner with him. Captain Glazier accepted the\r\ninvitation with pleasure, for it so happened that although he had for\r\nmany years been much among the natives of the forest he had never before\r\nhad an opportunity to dine with Indian royalty.\r\n\r\nFlat Mouth is a descendant of Aish-ki-bug-e-koszh, the most famous of\r\nall the Chippewa chiefs. He is stalwart in appearance and endowed with\r\nmarked talents, and well deserves the title of \"chief.\" At the appointed\r\ntime for the dinner, Captain Glazier, accompanied by his brother and Mr.\r\nPaine, went to his residence. They found him living in a comfortable\r\nlog-house of two rooms, well floored and roofed, with two small glass\r\nwindows. A plain board table stood in the centre of the front room, upon\r\nwhich the dinner was served. Pine board benches were placed upon each\r\nside of the table and at the ends, and they followed the example of the\r\nhost in sitting down. Five other persons were admitted to the meal, the\r\nwife of Flat Mouth, White Cloud, chief of the Mississippis, and three\r\nChippewa sub-chiefs. The wife of Flat Mouth sat near him and poured out\r\nthe tea, but ate or drank nothing herself. Tea-cups, spoons, plates,\r\nknives and forks, all of plain manufacture, were carefully arranged, the\r\nnumber corresponding with the guests. A fine mess of bass and white fish\r\ncut up and very palatably broiled filled a dish in the centre of the\r\ntable, from which the host helped his guests. Birch bark salt cellars\r\ncontaining pepper and salt mixed allowed each one to season his fish\r\nwith both or neither. A dish of blue berries picked on the shore of the\r\nlake completed the repast.\r\n\r\nWhile they were eating, the room became filled with Indians, apparently\r\nthe relatives and friends of Flat Mouth, and after the dinner was over,\r\nspeech-making being in order, White Cloud arose, and, assuming an\r\noratorical attitude, addressed Captain Glazier:\r\n\r\nHe expressed regret that white men had so long been in ignorance of the\r\nsource of the Mississippi, and said that although he had not himself\r\nseen the head of the Great River, there were many braves of his tribe\r\nwho were familiar with its location. He hoped that his white brother had\r\ncome thoroughly prepared to explore the country beyond Lake Itasca, and\r\nthat he would not return to his friends until he had found the true\r\nsource of the \"Father of Waters.\" Continuing he said: \"I am told that\r\nChe-no-wa-ge-sic, the Chippewa warrior, will accompany you. He is a\r\ngreat hunter and a faithful guide. He can supply you with game and\r\npaddle your canoe. The Chippewas are your friends, and will give you\r\nshelter in their wigwams.\"\r\n\r\nAfter he had finished, Flat Mouth presented Captain Glazier with a\r\nbeautifully beaded pipe and tobacco pouch, the work of his favorite\r\nsquaw, and expressed an earnest hope for the complete success of the\r\nexpedition. Although Captain Glazier needed nothing to keep the memory\r\nof this novel dinner fresh in his mind, he will always treasure this\r\nsouvenir of Flat Mouth among the many pleasant mementos of his visit to\r\nLeech Lake.\r\n\r\nHere again, in referring to this dinner and those whom he met there,\r\nCaptain Glazier's diary furnishes one of his vivid pen-pictures in an\r\nadmirably conceived criticism upon the mental attributes and general\r\ncharacter of the distinguished Indian chief, White Cloud, the orator of\r\nthe feast.\r\n\r\n\"I was much gratified on this occasion by the presence of White Cloud,\r\nwhom I had been told was the most respectable man in the Chippewa\r\ncountry; and if the term were applied to his intellectual qualities and\r\nthe power of drawing just conclusions from known premises, and the\r\neffects which these have had on his standing and influence with his own\r\ntribe, it is not misapplied. Shrewdness and quickness of perception most\r\nof the chiefs possess, but there is more of the character of common\r\nsense and practical reflection in White Cloud's remarks than I have\r\nobserved in most of the chiefs I have hitherto met. In his early life he\r\nwas both a warrior and a counselor, and these distinctions he held, not\r\nfrom any hereditary right, but from the force of his own character. I\r\nfound him quite ready to converse upon those topics which were of most\r\ninterest to him, and the sentiments he expressed were such as would\r\noccur to a mind which had possessed itself of facts and was capable of\r\nreasoning from them. His manners were grave and dignified, and his\r\noratory such as to render him popular wherever heard.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the return of Chenowagesic and other Indians, a council was held\r\nand Captain Glazier stated his object to them. They were asked to\r\nprovide maps of the country and to furnish an interpreter, guides and\r\ncanoes. Of course, it was impossible to conclude any such important\r\nnegotiations as attended an expedition involving the veritable source of\r\nthe noble red man's mystical stream without the characteristic Indian\r\nspeech. Accordingly, Chenowagesic arose, and with much dignity,\r\nextending his arm towards Captain Glazier, said:\r\n\r\n\"My brother, the country you are going to visit is my hunting ground. I\r\nhave hunted there many years and planted corn on the shores of Lake\r\nItasca. My father, now an old man, remembers the first white chief who\r\ncame to look for the source of the Great River. But, my brother, no\r\nwhite man has yet seen the head of the 'Father of Waters.' I will myself\r\nfurnish the maps you have requested, and will guide you onward. There\r\nare many lakes and rivers in the way, but the waters are favorable. I\r\nshall talk with my friends about the canoes, and see who will step\r\nforward to supply them. My own canoe shall be one of the number.\"\r\n\r\nBut a few hours were required to complete the maps, and on the following\r\nmorning, three Chippewas, including Chenowagesic, brought each a canoe\r\nand laid it down on the shore of the lake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPLORATION AND DISCOVERY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Launching the canoes.--Flat Mouth and White Cloud again.--An\r\n    inspiring scene.--Farewell to Leech Lake.--Up the Kabekanka\r\n    River.--Dinner at Lake Benedict.--Difficult navigation.--A\r\n    peaceful haven.--Supper and contentment.--Lake Garfield.--\r\n    Preparations for first portage.--Utter exhaustion.--Encampment\r\n    for the night.--The cavalry column.--Lake George and Lake\r\n    Paine.--The Naiwa River.--Six miles from Itasca.--Camping on\r\n    the Minnesota watershed.--A startling discovery.--Rations\r\n    giving out.--Ammunition gone.--Arrival at Lake Itasca.\r\n\r\nThe following day, July seventeenth, was Sunday, and Captain Glazier,\r\nbeing a guest of Rev. Edwin Benedict, felt some delicacy in commencing\r\nhis journey on the Sabbath. Mr. Benedict, however, greatly to his\r\nrelief, not only decided that there could be nothing objectionable in\r\nhis doing so, but also offered to launch his canoe and bid him\r\nGod-speed. In fact, Mr. Benedict had done all in his power to alleviate\r\nthe discomfort of his stay, by placing at his service the only\r\n\"civilized\" bed the village possessed, but now Bishop Whipple was hourly\r\nexpected to arrive in the course of his regular visitations to the\r\nmissionary posts he had established, and the Captain was not inclined to\r\nmonopolize a luxury which doubtless the Bishop would appreciate as much\r\nas himself. Accordingly, early in the morning, which proved to be clear\r\nand beautiful, the explorers met on the shore of the lake, preparatory\r\nto their embarkation. A large number of Indians had assembled to see\r\nthem off. Flat Mouth was there, watching his white brothers with\r\ninterest as they stepped cautiously into the canoes, for Captain Glazier\r\nhad not forgotten his first experience with one of these light vessels.\r\nWhite Cloud, also, was there, chief of the Mississippis, thinking,\r\nmayhap, somewhat sadly of the time when the great \"Father of Waters\" was\r\nknown only to the Red Man who hunted on its banks, or glided swiftly\r\ndown its stream, in happy ignorance of the days when city after city\r\nshould line its shores, and steamboats force their devious way through\r\nits waters. There, too, were the friends and relatives of Chenowagesic\r\nand the other guides, watching with characteristic gravity the final\r\npreparations. Rev. Mr. Benedict, the only white man on the beach other\r\nthan the explorers, stood ready to launch the canoe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Captain Glazier Embarking For The Headwaters\r\nOf The Mississippi.]\r\n\r\nIt was a scene well worthy the painter's most cunning skill--the\r\nbeautiful lake, the wigwams dotting its shores here and there, the dark\r\ngreen of the forest in the background, the Indians with their bright red\r\nblankets adding bits of vivid coloring to the scene, and, at the water's\r\nedge, Captain Glazier, upright and soldierly in bearing, ready to step\r\ninto his canoe and start forth in search of the mysterious springs which\r\nhad hitherto baffled the investigations of all previous explorers.\r\n\r\nFinally, all was ready, the baggage being evenly distributed in the\r\nthree canoes with an Indian in each to guide and paddle it. Standing in\r\nthe foremost canoe Captain Glazier signified his readiness to start,\r\nwhen Mr. Benedict pushed the light bark into the water, and waved his\r\nhat in token of farewell. A general waving of hats followed, and soon\r\nour explorers found themselves gliding swiftly over the bosom of the\r\nlake, and almost out of sight of the friends who still watched them from\r\nthe shore.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour's paddling they reached the other side of the arm of the\r\nlake on which the Agency is situated, and prepared for a short portage\r\nacross a point of land which brought them to a larger arm, where the\r\nwind and the waves had a sweep of fifteen or twenty miles. Coasting\r\nalong the shore for some distance they finally paddled across the lake\r\nto the mouth of the Kabekanka River. A brisk wind was blowing from the\r\nnorth, and the waves ran so high as to cause some anxiety in the minds\r\nof those who were not accustomed to the motion of a canoe; for, now they\r\nrose lightly to the top of the wave and anon sank with a swash into the\r\ntrough, splashing and dashing the water over their bows. Gradually,\r\nhowever, as they became more used to their frail barks, their anxiety\r\nlessened, and they began to enjoy the beautiful prospect before them,\r\nand to inhale with delight the invigorating breeze.\r\n\r\nAfter two or three hours steady work they reached the inlet into which\r\nthis branch of the Kabekanka empties. So choked up is this inlet with\r\nreeds and rushes that it required some skill to force an entrance for\r\nthe canoes. Finally they succeeded, and paddling up the river they came,\r\nat about eleven o'clock, to a little lake caused by the widening of the\r\nstream, which Captain Glazier named Lake Benedict, in honor of Rev.\r\nEdwin Benedict, who had treated him so courteously during his stay at\r\nLeech Lake. Reaching the upper end of this lake they disembarked and\r\nprepared to enjoy their noon-day meal.\r\n\r\nA brief rest, in order the better to digest their hearty dinner,\r\nrefreshed the travelers so much that they soon re-embarked and pursued\r\ntheir voyage. Leaving the lake they entered another branch of the\r\nKabekanka, and found that at its mouth the stream ran between low\r\nshores, and that its bed was so overgrown with wild rice as to make it\r\nalmost impossible for a canoe to work its way through. Further up the\r\nriver narrowed and ran more swiftly, the wild rice giving place to snags\r\nand driftwood, which made navigation even more toilsome. Almost worn\r\nout, our weary voyagers began to despair of finding navigable waters,\r\nwhen to their great joy they espied at a little distance what seemed\r\nlike a pond filled with rushes. Struggling onward once more they soon\r\nreached the spot, and found what they supposed to be a pond was the\r\noutlet of a beautiful lake about seven miles long and three broad, into\r\nwhose quiet waters they glided with glad hearts and a shout of delight.\r\n\r\nIt was now late in the afternoon, and time to look about for a\r\ncamping-ground, on which to spend the night. Paddling slowly up the\r\nlake, trolling for fish as they went, they soon found a spot which\r\nanswered their purpose admirably. It was a bluff near the lake, wooded\r\nwith Norway pines, and sloping rather abruptly towards the water. By\r\nthis time they had caught half a dozen fine pickerel, and, disembarking,\r\nsoon had their fire built, tents pitched and hammocks swung. The guides\r\nprepared supper of broiled fish, accompanied by such canned dainties as\r\nhad been brought with them and their keen appetites caused by the fresh\r\nbreeze and toilsome paddling prepared them to enjoy with zest their\r\nfirst supper in the open air.\r\n\r\nSupper being over they whiled away the time very pleasantly by\r\ncommenting upon the experiences of the day, and discussing the object of\r\ntheir undertaking, and so free were they from all discomfort, even from\r\nthat caused by those torments, the mosquitoes, they felt ready to\r\ndeclare the hardships of their journey had been much magnified. In this\r\npeaceful and contented frame of mind they retired to their tents and\r\nslept soundly until next morning.\r\n\r\nRising at break of day they were soon on the water making their way to\r\nthe head of the lake, where they breakfasted, and upon learning that no\r\nname had ever been given to this beautiful body of water, Captain\r\nGlazier designated it Lake Garfield, in honor of our murdered President.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Camp Among The Pines.]\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast they were informed by the guides that they had now come\r\nto the end of uninterrupted water communication, and must prepare for a\r\nportage of two and a half miles. Little did any of the white members of\r\nthe party guess what this meant, and so with light hearts they packed\r\ntheir traps into convenient bundles and prepared to take up the line of\r\nmarch. The Indians, in the meanwhile, had made for themselves packs\r\nweighing about a hundred pounds. These packs they wrapped in blankets\r\nand secured with a strap which passed over their foreheads, the packs\r\nresting on their shoulders. Each then placed a canoe, bottom upwards, on\r\ntop of his pack, holding it there by means of a cross bar.\r\n\r\nAll were now ready, and the order, \"March,\" was given. Off started the\r\nIndians in single file with as much apparent ease as if they were\r\ntaking a pleasure walk along a well-beaten path instead of plunging,\r\nheavily laden, into the recesses of a trackless forest. Captain Glazier,\r\nhis brother and Mr. Paine followed their lead, guided only by the white\r\nbottoms of the canoes gleaming through the dense foliage. It was almost\r\nimpossible to keep up with the Indians, whose steady trot at times\r\nincreased to a run, and in their efforts to do so they barked their\r\nshins, scratched their hands and faces, tore their clothes, and were\r\nalmost devoured by the mosquitoes. On they went, however, determined not\r\nto be beaten by the red man, who showed no sign of fatigue or stopping.\r\nFinally, in spite of their determination to the contrary, they felt\r\nabsolutely compelled to cry \"halt,\" when lo! the Indians halted, removed\r\ntheir packs, and, smiling back at them, no doubt in appreciation of\r\ntheir discomfort, calmly began to pick the blue berries which grew in\r\nabundance all along the route. With a sigh of relief, the rest of the\r\nparty threw themselves full length upon the ground, utterly and\r\ncompletely exhausted, and fairly groaned aloud when they saw the Indians\r\nwere about to resume their packs. There was no help for it, however, so\r\nstarting up they prepared to follow, but at a somewhat slower pace. For\r\nseveral hours they continued their fatiguing journey, until, at eleven\r\no'clock, reaching a high, clear piece of ground, they decided to rest\r\nand have dinner.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner they found they were far too weary to proceed, so the\r\nIndians, who were apparently as fresh as when they first started, made\r\ntwo trips to the next lake, carrying everything. On their last trip they\r\nwere accompanied by their exhausted white brethren, who succeeded at\r\nlast in summoning up sufficient resolution to carry themselves.\r\n\r\nEmbarking once more in their canoes they pulled through three small\r\nlakes connected by creeks, finally camping for the night on the shore of\r\na fourth lake. The next morning they were up bright and early and ready\r\nto resume their voyage, which for this day was through a chain of lakes\r\nsometimes connected by small creeks, but more frequently requiring them\r\nto make a portage from one to the other. Gabekanazeba, meaning\r\n\"portage,\" is the Indian name applied to these lakes and the stream\r\nwhich connects some of them; but Captain Glazier, assuming the right\r\ntacitly yielded to all explorers, called them in order after the brave\r\ncavalry commanders of the Rebellion. Bayard, Stoneman, Pleasanton,\r\nCuster, Kilpatrick, Gregg, Buford and Davies, form the column, with\r\nSheridan, as the name of the largest and finest, at its head.\r\n\r\nFinally, they reached a lake of considerable size whose Indian name,\r\ntranslated, means Blue Snake. This they crossed at a point where its\r\nwidth is about five miles, catching a number of fine bass as they went,\r\nand camped for the night on a strip of land between it and a second lake\r\nabout half its size. These two bodies of water were respectively\r\ndenominated by Captain Glazier Lake George and Lake Paine, after his\r\nbrother George and Mr. Barrett Channing Paine, who accompanied him\r\nthroughout his entire voyage, sharing his dangers and rejoicing in his\r\nultimate success.\r\n\r\nUpon resuming their journey next morning, July twentieth, the canoes\r\nwere paddled across a corner of Lake Paine, and, after a portage of half\r\na mile, they entered a small river, called by the Indians Naiwa. This\r\nriver they descended for about five miles, and after making another\r\nshort portage, reached a little stream, upon the shore of which they\r\nrested for dinner. Resuming their voyage they arrived at a beautiful\r\nlake late in the afternoon, upon which Captain Glazier bestowed the name\r\nof Elvira, in memory of his eldest sister.\r\n\r\nHere the Indians informed them that they were only six miles from\r\nItasca, but the joy with which they received the good news was somewhat\r\nchecked when they heard that the whole distance, with the exception of\r\none small lake, must be made by portage. However, they had a night's\r\nrest before them, so taking the canoes out of the water, they were\r\ncarried to the top of the nearest ridge of land, where the tents were\r\npitched for the night.\r\n\r\nTheir camp was now situated on one of a series of diluvial ridges which\r\nforms the highest ground between the Allegheny and Rocky Mountains. It\r\nis, in fact, the watershed separating the Mississippi, Red River of the\r\nNorth and St. Lawrence River systems, all these great streams having\r\ntheir origin in springs or lakes found within this section of Minnesota.\r\n\r\nWhile camping here a discovery was made which caused the party much\r\nuneasiness. This was the startling fact that their supply of canned\r\nmeats and other rations was fast giving out! To appreciate their\r\nsituation under these circumstances we must remember that they were far\r\nfrom any trading post, and in a country where they could not hope to\r\nfind even an Indian at that season of the year, the many lakes and\r\nmarshy ground making hunting impracticable. To add to their dismay, it\r\nwas also discovered that during one of the exhausting portages the\r\ntrolling hooks had been lost in passing through a bog, while their\r\nammunition was reduced to sixty-five rounds. Too late did the Captain\r\nregret the permission given to his brother and Mr. Paine, both of whom\r\nwere but amateur sportsmen, to fire at any game they might see. They had\r\nblazed away recklessly during the entire voyage, so far succeeding in\r\nkilling but one duck. Evidently _they_ could not be depended upon to\r\nreplenish the depleted larder. Something had to be done, and after\r\nresolutions of strict economy were proposed and unanimously adopted, it\r\nwas decided that hereafter the Captain should occupy the bow of the\r\nfirst canoe, and, with gun cocked, be ready to fire at any game which a\r\nsudden turn in the river might discover. How the explorers wished they\r\ncould subsist on the blue berries which were fully as abundant as the\r\nmosquitoes along the entire route! But it required incessant eating of\r\nthese to satisfy the appetite, and even then, hunger, in a short time,\r\nasserted its former sway.\r\n\r\nThe morning following this discovery was so foggy that it was impossible\r\nto make a start before seven o'clock. The day was warm, and the journey\r\nunusually fatiguing, consisting mainly of a portage twice the length of\r\nthe first one they had encountered. It was, therefore, with unfeigned\r\ndelight that, late in the afternoon of the twenty-first of July, they\r\ndiscovered the placid waters of Itasca just ahead of them. Launching\r\ntheir canoes, they soon reached Schoolcraft Island, after a pull of\r\nabout two miles, and prepared to make this point their headquarters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Making A Portage.]\r\n\r\nLake Itasca was discovered by Henry Rowe Schoolcraft in 1832, and was\r\nlocated by him as the source of the Mississippi. It is a beautiful body\r\nof water, with an extreme length of about five miles, and an average\r\nbreadth of a mile and a half. It has three arms of nearly equal size,\r\nand the island, named after the discoverer of the lake, is situated near\r\nthe point where they come together. This island proved to be about three\r\nacres in extent, and is so covered with underbrush that our gallant\r\nlittle party had much difficulty in clearing a sufficient space for\r\ntheir camp. Only one or two trees of any size were found, and on the\r\nlargest of these, a pine, Mr. Paine carved their names and the date of\r\ntheir arrival.\r\n\r\nBy this time Captain Glazier had become more than ever convinced,\r\nthrough conversations with Chenowagesic, that he was right in his\r\npreconceived opinion that Itasca was not the source of the Mississippi.\r\nHe was also satisfied that Chenowagesic was pre-eminently fitted to aid\r\nhim in discovering the fountain head, owing to the fact that he was\r\nthoroughly at home in that region, having hunted and trapped there for\r\nmany years. So intense had become the Captain's desire not to return\r\nuntil he had thoroughly explored Itasca and the surrounding country,\r\nthat it was with an anxious heart he now put the question to his\r\ncompanions: would they be willing, on such a limited supply of rations\r\nas they had remaining, to assist him in his explorations, or would they\r\nvote for an immediate descent of the river? To his great relief he found\r\nhe had so completely inoculated them, or at least his brother and Mr.\r\nPaine, with his own ambition that with one voice they decided in favor\r\nof a thorough exploration. The Indians were soon persuaded to give\r\ntheir consent, and so, before retiring for the night, the entire party\r\nexpressed their determination to stand by the Captain until he was\r\nsatisfied that every effort had been made to discover the remotest\r\nsprings in which the Great River really had its origin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map Of Lake Glazier]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCOVERY OF THE SOURCE OF THE MISSISSIPPI.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Short rations.--Empty haversacks and depleted\r\n    cartridge-boxes.--Statement of Chenowagesic.--Captain Glazier's\r\n    diary.--Vivid description.--Coasting Itasca.--Chenowagesic\r\n    puzzled.--The barrier overcome.--Victory! the Infant\r\n    Mississippi.--Enthusiastic desire to see the source.--The goal\r\n    reached.--A beautiful lake.--The fountain head.--An American the\r\n    first white man to stand by its side.--Schoolcraft.--How he came\r\n    to miss the lake.--Appropriate ceremonies.--Captain Glazier's\r\n    speech.--Naming the lake.--Chenowagesic.--Military\r\n    honors.--\"Three cheers for the explorer.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Glazier had instructed his Indian guides to wake him early the\r\nfollowing morning, July twenty-second; but when he himself awoke at six\r\no'clock he found the remainder of the party still sound asleep, the\r\ntoilsome portages of the preceding day having completely exhausted them.\r\nRousing his companions, preparations were begun for breakfast, which\r\nconsisted of a small piece of bacon and one \"flap-jack\" each. But the\r\ndetermination of the previous night had so inspirited all that the small\r\ndimensions of the breakfast were scarcely noticed, and the conversation\r\nturned upon the absorbing topic--would they discover a source of the\r\nMississippi other than Lake Itasca?\r\n\r\nChenowagesic again repeated his statement that there was another lake to\r\nthe south, which he called Pokegama, meaning, \"a lake on the side of or\r\nbeyond another lake.\" This lake, he said, was smaller than Itasca, but\r\ncontributed to the latter through its largest inflowing stream. Captain\r\nGlazier, therefore, instructed him to guide them to this lake and allow\r\nthem to make their own observations regarding it. Accordingly, breakfast\r\nbeing over, the canoes were launched and the coasting of Itasca begun.\r\n\r\nCaptain Glazier's own account of the events succeeding this breakfast on\r\nSchoolcraft Island is so clear, and his description brings so vivid a\r\npicture before the eye of the reader, that it is only necessary to quote\r\nthe following passages from his diary for the reader to understand the\r\nimportance of the discovery which he made:\r\n\r\n\"Notwithstanding the fact that we were now confronted with empty\r\nhaversacks and depleted cartridge boxes my companions were still eager\r\nto follow my lead in the work of exploration beyond Itasca, which from\r\nthe beginning had been the controlling incentive of our expedition, the\r\ngrand objective towards which we bent all our energies. To stand at the\r\n_source_; to look upon the remotest rills and springs which contribute\r\nto the birth of the Great River of North America, to write 'Finis' in\r\nthe volume opened by the renowned De Soto more than three hundred years\r\nago, and in which Marquette, La Salle, Hennepin, La Hontan, Carver,\r\nPike, Beltrami, Schoolcraft and Nicollet have successively inscribed\r\ntheir names, were quite enough to revive the drooping spirits of the\r\nmost depressed.\r\n\r\n\"During our encampment on the island Chenowagesic again reminded me that\r\nhe had planted corn there many years before, and that his wigwam once\r\nstood near the spot where we had pitched our tents. He also repeated\r\nwhat he had told me before launching the canoes at Leech Lake that the\r\nregion about Lake Itasca was his hunting-ground, and that he was\r\nthoroughly acquainted with all the rivers, lakes and ponds within a\r\nhundred miles. He further said that Paul Beaulieu was in error\r\nconcerning the source of the Great River, and led me to conclude that\r\nthe primal reservoir was above and beyond Itasca, and that this lake was\r\nsimply an expansion of the Mississippi, as are Bemidji, Cass,\r\nWinnibegoshish and several others.\r\n\r\n\"Fully convinced that the statements of Chenowagesic were entirely\r\ntrustworthy, and knowing from past experience that he was perfectly\r\nreliable as a guide, we put our canoes into the water at eight o'clock,\r\nand at once began the work of coasting Itasca for its feeders. We found\r\nthe outlets of six small streams, two having well-defined mouths, and\r\nfour filtering into the lake through bogs. The upper end of the\r\nsouthwestern arm is heavily margined with rushes and swamp grass, and it\r\nwas not without considerable difficulty that we forced our way through\r\nthis natural barrier into the larger of the two open streams which flow\r\ninto this end of the lake.\r\n\r\n\"Although perfectly familiar with the topography of the country, and\r\nentirely confident that he could lead us to the beautiful lake which he\r\nhad so often described, Chenowagesic was for some moments greatly\r\ndisturbed by the network of rushes in which we found ourselves\r\ntemporarily entangled. Leaping from his canoe he pushed the rushes right\r\nand left with his paddle, and soon, to our great delight, threw up his\r\nhands and gave a characteristic Chippewa yell, thereby signifying that\r\nhe had found the object of his search. Returning, he seized the bow of\r\nmy canoe, and pulled it after him through the rushes out into the clear,\r\nglistening waters of the infant Mississippi, which, at the point of\r\nentering Itasca, is seven feet wide, and from twelve to fifteen inches\r\ndeep.\r\n\r\n\"Lusty work with our paddles for half an hour brought us to a blockade\r\nof fallen timber. Determined to float in my canoe upon the surface of\r\nthe lake towards which we were paddling, I directed the guides to remove\r\nthe obstructions, and continue to urge the canoes rapidly forward,\r\nalthough opposed by a strong and constantly increasing current.\r\nSometimes we found it necessary to lift the canoes over logs, and\r\noccasionally to remove diminutive sand-bars from the bed of the stream\r\nwith our paddles. As we neared the head of this primal section of the\r\nmighty river, we could readily touch both shores with our hands at the\r\nsame time, while the average depth of water in the channel did not\r\nexceed ten inches.\r\n\r\n\"Every paddle-stroke seemed to increase the ardor with which we were\r\ncarried forward. The desire to see the actual source of a river so\r\ncelebrated as the Mississippi, whose mouth had been reached nearly two\r\ncenturies before, was doubtless the impelling motive. In their eagerness\r\nto obtain a first view of the beautiful lake toward which we were\r\npaddling, and greatly annoyed by the slow progress made in the canoes,\r\nmy brother and Paine stepped ashore and proposed a race to the crest of\r\nthe hill which Chenowagesic told them overhung the lake. To this\r\nproposition of my companions I made objection and insisted that all\r\nshould see the goal of our expedition from the canoes. What had long\r\nbeen sought at last appeared suddenly. On pulling and pushing our way\r\nthrough a network of rushes similar to the one encountered on leaving\r\nItasca, the cheering sight of a transparent body of water burst upon our\r\nview. It was a beautiful lake--the source of the 'Father of Waters.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lake Glazier--source Of The Mississippi.\r\nDiscovered By Captain Glazier, July 22, 1881.]\r\n\r\n\"A few moments later and our little flotilla of three canoes was put in\r\nmotion, headed for a small promontory which we discerned at the opposite\r\nend of the lake. We paddled slowly across one of the purest and most\r\ntranquil sheets of water we had encountered in our voyage. Not a breath\r\nof air was stirring. We halted frequently to scan its shores, and to run\r\nour eyes along the verdure-covered hills which enclose its basin. These\r\nelevations are at a distance of from three to four miles, and are\r\ncovered chiefly with white pines, intermingled with the cedar, spruce\r\nand tamarack. The beach is fringed with a mixed foliage of the evergreen\r\nspecies. At one point we observed pond lilies, and at another a small\r\nquantity of wild rice.\r\n\r\n\"As we neared the promontory towards which we were paddling, a deer was\r\nseen standing on the shore, and an eagle swept majestically over our\r\nheads with food for her young, which we soon discovered were securely\r\nlodged in the top of a tall pine. The water-fowl noticed upon the lake\r\nwere apparently little disturbed by our presence, and seldom left the\r\nsurface of the water.\r\n\r\n\"This lake is about a mile and a half in its greatest diameter, and\r\nwould be nearly an oval in form, but for a single promontory which\r\nextends its shores into the lake so as to give it in outline the\r\nappearance of a heart. Its feeders are three boggy streams, two of which\r\nenter on the right and left of the headland, and have their origin in\r\nsprings at the foot of sand-hills, from five to six miles distant. The\r\nthird is but little more than a mile in length, has no clearly defined\r\ncourse, and is the outlet of a small lake situated in a marsh to the\r\nsouth-westward. These three creeks were named in the order of their\r\ndiscovery: Eagle, Excelsior and Deer. The small lake, which is the\r\nsource of Eagle Creek, I called Alice, after my daughter.\r\n\r\n\"Having satisfied myself as to its remotest feeders, I called my\r\ncompanions into line at the foot of the promontory which overlooks the\r\nlake, and talked for a few moments of the Mississippi and its explorers,\r\ntelling them I was confident that we were looking upon the True Source\r\nof the Great River; that we had completed a work begun by De Soto in\r\n1541, and had corrected a geographical error of half a century's\r\nstanding. Concluding my remarks, I requested a volley from their\r\nfire-arms for each member of the party, in commemoration of our\r\ndiscovery. When the firing ceased, Paine gave me a surprise by stepping\r\nto the front and proposing 'that the newly discovered lake be named\r\n\"Glazier\" in honor of the leader of the expedition.' The proposition was\r\nseconded by Moses Legard, the interpreter, and carried by acclamation,\r\nnotwithstanding my protest that it should retain its Indian name,\r\nPokegama.\r\n\r\n\"Much to the surprise of every one, as we were about closing our\r\nceremonies, Chenowagesic assumed an oratorical attitude, and addressed\r\nme as follows in a few words of true Indian eloquence: 'My brother, I\r\nhave come with you through many lakes and rivers to the head of the\r\nFather of Waters. The shores of this lake are my hunting-ground. Here I\r\nhave had my wigwam and planted corn for many years. When I again roam\r\nthrough these forests, and look on this lake, source of the Great River,\r\nI will look on you.'\r\n\r\n\"The latitude of this lake is not far from 47 deg.. Its height above the sea\r\nis an object of geographical interest which, in the absence of actual\r\nsurvey, it may subserve the purposes of useful inquiry to estimate. From\r\nnotes taken during the ascent it cannot be less than seven feet above\r\nLake Itasca. Adding the estimate of 1,575 feet submitted by Schoolcraft\r\nin 1832, as the elevation of that lake, the Mississippi may be said to\r\noriginate in an altitude of 1,582 feet above the Atlantic Ocean. Taking\r\nformer estimates as the basis and computing reasonably through the\r\nwestern fork, its length may be placed at 3,184 miles. Assuming that the\r\nbarometrical height of its source is 1,582 feet, it has a mean descent\r\nof over six inches per mile.\r\n\r\n\"At Lake Bemidji the Mississippi reaches its highest northing, which is\r\nin the neighborhood of 47 deg. 30'. The origin of the river in an untraveled\r\nand secluded region between Leech Lake and the Red River of the North,\r\nnot less than a degree of latitude south of Turtle Lake, which was for a\r\nlong time supposed to be the source, removes both forks of the stream\r\noutside the usual track of the fur-traders, and presents a good reason,\r\nperhaps, why its fountain-head has remained so long enveloped in\r\nuncertainty.\"\r\n\r\nThe information imparted in the foregoing extract brings the whole gist\r\nof the important discovery within the compass of a few paragraphs, and\r\nit will be readily seen from this clear description of the new-found\r\nlake that the source of the Mississippi is at last correctly located.\r\nMany others have attempted to find it: Schoolcraft was sent out by the\r\nGovernment especially for its discovery, but it remained for Captain\r\nGlazier to successfully accomplish an undertaking which had hitherto\r\nbaffled the most determined explorers. This, too, he did entirely at his\r\nown expense, and with no other motive than such as an ardent search\r\nafter truth inspires in ambitious minds. He had long doubted that Itasca\r\nwas the source of our greatest river. He knew no other way of satisfying\r\nhis doubt than by going himself to the remotest headwaters of the mighty\r\nstream. He therefore went there, for with him to think is to determine,\r\nto determine is to act. Friends tried to persuade him he was engaging in\r\na useless and extravagant expedition, and those to whom he applied for\r\ninformation respecting the country through which he must pass warned him\r\nthat he would have to undergo many hardships; but to all this advice he\r\nturned a deaf ear. His active, energetic, and enterprising temperament\r\nwas proof against all fear of discomfort, and his desire to know the\r\ntruth overruled every other feeling. And, when at last he stood by the\r\nbeautiful lake, the goal of his search, all the trials and annoyances of\r\nhis arduous journey sank into insignificance--lost in the depths of his\r\ncontent.\r\n\r\nHis companions gazed with delight upon the peaceful scene which lay\r\nbefore them; and, as they noted the peculiar outline of the lake, what\r\nwonder that the thought came--this was indeed the heart of the\r\nMississippi, pulsating with life for the great stream flowing onward and\r\never onward, enriching and ennobling the land, until at last it loses\r\nitself, by reason of its own vastness, in the waters of the Ocean.\r\n\r\nThey rejoiced, too, that the first white man to stand at the\r\nfountain-head of America's greatest river was an American--an American\r\nwho had fought bravely and suffered many privations for his country. And\r\nas they watched the eagle, whirling in his flight over their heads, they\r\nfelt glad that he had chosen this spot for his home, in which to rear\r\nhis young in the same proud, free spirit which made him so fit an emblem\r\nfor their glorious land.\r\n\r\nMuch astonishment was expressed by those of the party who were aware of\r\nSchoolcraft's expedition in 1832, that he should have missed finding\r\nthis lake so closely connected with Itasca, and various were the\r\nsurmises as to the cause of this remarkable oversight. One plausible\r\nsuggestion was, that the rushes and reeds had so obstructed the entrance\r\nof the stream into Itasca, that not having a previous knowledge of its\r\nwhereabouts, there was nothing surprising in its being overlooked. By\r\nfar the most probable theory, however, was advanced by Captain Glazier,\r\nwho stated, quoting Schoolcraft himself as authority, that when he\r\nreached Itasca he was too much hurried to make a thorough exploration.\r\nHe had made an engagement to meet some Indians in council at the mouth\r\nof the Crow-Wing River, fully seven days' journey from this point, and\r\nhe had not more than the seven days to accomplish it. Accordingly, as\r\nhis mind had been prepared by his guides all along to accept Itasca as\r\nthe true source, he only stopped long enough to see and hurriedly coast\r\nthe lake, and then returned to the Indian council on Crow-Wing River.\r\nThis is Schoolcraft's own statement, and there can be no doubt that it\r\nis the true reason for his failure to locate the source correctly. He\r\nnever saw the beautiful lake to the south of Itasca, fed by the springs\r\nand streams of the marshes which give birth to the Infant Mississippi.\r\n\r\nTherefore, he could not know that Itasca was but an expansion of the\r\nstream, like other lakes in its onward course, a sudden growth, as it\r\nwere, which gave promise of the vast proportions the mighty giant would\r\nhereafter assume. There would be something almost sad in his coming so\r\nnear and yet missing the mark at which he had aimed, if it were not that\r\nhe lived and _died_ in the belief that he was right in his assertion\r\nthat the great Father of Waters rose in the lake which he, oddly enough,\r\nnamed Itasca. Oddly, because Itasca is a name given by the Indians to\r\nthe mysteries of their religion and necromantic arts, and Schoolcraft,\r\nby his decided statements in regard to the lake, succeeded in enveloping\r\nin mystery the true source for another fifty years. Why it should _ever_\r\nhave been a mystery is a question often raised; but there can be no\r\ndoubt that it is owing to the fact that no fur traders and but few\r\nIndians ever penetrate the boggy, swampy, lake-covered regions of\r\nNorthern Minnesota.\r\n\r\nOur explorers, having finished their survey of the lake, now disembarked\r\nand prepared to hold suitable and becoming ceremonies to celebrate their\r\nmomentous discovery. First they drank of the clear, cool water to the\r\nhealth of Captain Glazier, who had led them on to making this grand\r\nachievement. The Captain then thanked them in a few eloquent and\r\nappropriate remarks for their good wishes and also for their faith in\r\nhim, and the determination they had shown to stand by him until he had\r\nreached the goal he sought. He spoke, too, of the magnitude and\r\nimportance of their discovery, of the knowledge it would add to the\r\ngeographical lore of the country, and of the strangeness of the fact\r\nthat the source of their mightiest river had so long been a disputed\r\nquestion. The cause of this he attributed to the peculiarities of the\r\nregion in which it rose, the many lakes and swamps making much traveling\r\nimpracticable; and recalling the hardships which they themselves had\r\nencountered, expressed his belief that it was not to be wondered at that\r\nearlier explorers had been deterred from making the venture at a time\r\nwhen civilization was even further remote than it was at present. He\r\nthen recounted some of the exploits of the heroic old explorers, and,\r\nreminding his companions that three hundred years had passed away since\r\nwhite men first beheld the mighty stream by whose cradle they were now\r\nstanding, he congratulated them on completing the work begun by De Soto,\r\nMarquette, La Salle, Hennepin and Joliet.\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished Captain Glazier, true to his soldierly instincts,\r\nproposed firing six volleys over the lake, one in honor of each member\r\nof the party. This was accordingly done, and Mr. Paine closed the\r\nceremonies by leading off with three hearty American cheers for \"the\r\ndiscoverer and the discovery.\" The Indians chimed in with a Chippewa\r\nyell, and then, while the air was still reverberating with the sound of\r\ntheir voices, they all paused to take in once more the scene of their\r\nexplorations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOWN THE GREAT RIVER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Voyage from Source to Sea.--Three thousand miles in an open\r\n    canoe.--\"Pioneers of the Mississippi.\"--A thrilling lecture.--The\r\n    long voyage begun.--Mosquitoes.--Hunger and exhaustion.--The\r\n    Captain kills an otter.--Lakes Bemidji and Winnibegoshish.--An\r\n    Indian missionary.--Wind-bound.--Chenowagesic bids farewell to\r\n    the Captain.--Pokegama Falls.--Grand Rapids.--Meeting the first\r\n    steamboat.--Aitkin.--Great enthusiasm.--The new canoes.--Leaving\r\n    Aitkin.--Arrival at Little Falls.--Escorted in triumph to the\r\n    town.--\"Captain Glazier!

True, he had done what had\r\nnever been done before--he had penetrated into the innermost recesses of\r\nthe mystery which had so long enshrouded the head-waters of the\r\nMississippi, and traversed a part of the country where white man had\r\nnever trod before; he had added greatly to the geographical knowledge of\r\nhis country's mightiest river, and satisfied the spirit of investigation\r\nwhich had impelled him to begin this novel adventure; but the by no\r\nmeans least interesting, and at the same time, practical part of his\r\nvoyage still lay before him. De Soto, Marquette, La Salle, Hennepin,\r\nJoliet and Schoolcraft, all had navigated but portions of the great\r\nflood of water to which they owe their renown; _he_ would descend its\r\nentire course from its source in the wilds of Minnesota to its outlet in\r\nthe Gulf of Mexico. He would become familiar with the most striking\r\nfeatures of the country on either side, and study through personal\r\nintercourse the varying phases of American character and life, as he\r\npassed from the fur-bearing, lumber-dealing States of the North, by the\r\nvast wheat fields of the West, and finally reach the cotton and sugar\r\nplantations of the South. No one had ever attempted this before, and it\r\nis probable no one will ever attempt it again, for the perils of a\r\nvoyage of three thousand miles in an open canoe are not purely\r\nimaginary. And yet this was the only way in which he could\r\nsatisfactorily and practically accomplish his object of making careful\r\nand minute observations along the route. Then, too, being himself so\r\nmuch interested in all that concerned the great \"Father of Waters,\" he\r\nwished to awaken in others a like interest, and to effect this prepared\r\na lecture on the \"Pioneers of the Mississippi,\" which he intended to\r\ndeliver at every town of importance on both banks as he floated down the\r\nstream. \"Pay tribute to those to whom tribute is due\" is his motto, and\r\nso the tragic fate of De Soto, the sad but poetic death of Marquette,\r\nand the triumphant banner of La Salle, called forth from his ready pen a\r\nlecture replete with historical interest.\r\n\r\nStanding, then, by the source of the mighty river, around which so many\r\nbeautiful Indian legends cluster, and about which the white man has ever\r\nbeen curious, the Captain felt a natural throb of pride that so much of\r\nhis great undertaking had been successfully achieved, and a hope that\r\nthe future held further good in store for him.\r\n\r\nGiving the order for embarkation the canoes were soon gliding across the\r\nwater bound for Lake Itasca. Entering this lake, a short stop was made\r\nat Schoolcraft's Island in order to obtain the remainder of their\r\nluggage; after which they re-embarked, at three o'clock in the\r\nafternoon, and continued the descent of the river.\r\n\r\nFrom Lake Itasca the Mississippi flows almost directly north, then takes\r\na turn to the east, and finally sweeps with ever increasing volume south\r\nto the Gulf of Mexico. At first it quietly pursues its course between\r\nrich meadows, and promises easy and safe navigation, so that our little\r\nband of explorers after leaving Itasca expected to have a quiet and\r\nuneventful voyage until they reached the inhabited part of the country.\r\nSuch was not the case, however, for they soon found their progress very\r\nmuch impeded by drift-wood, snags, rapids, and boulders of every size\r\nand description. They overcame these obstacles in various ways, all\r\nrequiring much exertion and endurance, and many a time their patience\r\nwas nearly exhausted. Sometimes they forced the canoes under the logs\r\nwhich lay across the stream, and again cut a passage-way through them.\r\nNow they removed the drift from their path and now were obliged to lift\r\nthe canoes over it. A little further on a huge boulder would confront\r\nthem, making it necessary to disembark and carry the boats around.\r\nPresently a dangerous rapid would be met, and in shooting it some member\r\nof the party would be precipitated into, the water, or perhaps a hole\r\nstove in one of the canoes. At last they were obliged to make a\r\nportage of about half a mile, and upon launching again, soon discovered\r\nthat the principal obstructions had been overcome. This was a great\r\nrelief to them, for the intolerable annoyance of swarms of mosquitoes\r\nwhich came in clouds about them, biting even through their clothing, was\r\nquite enough to bear patiently without having the hardships consequent\r\nupon such rugged voyaging to endure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Captain Glazier Running Rapids On The Upper Mississippi.]\r\n\r\nLaborious, however, as they found this unusually rough canoeing, and\r\ntroublesome as were the mosquitoes, both trials sank into insignificance\r\nwhen compared with their ever present danger of starvation. It will be\r\nremembered how bravely all had decided, when they first made the\r\nstartling discovery that their supplies were at a low ebb, to pursue\r\ntheir investigations even at the risk of running completely out of\r\nrations. The strictest economy had been observed ever since, but despite\r\nall their care they now found that unless they could reach a\r\ntrading-post within a couple of days they would be compelled to subsist\r\non such game and fish as they could capture; rather a precarious means\r\nof existence to say the least, especially as they had but a very few\r\nrounds of ammunition left. It was unanimously voted that Captain\r\nGlazier, who was by far the best marksman of the party, should occupy\r\nthe bow of the first canoe, and gun in hand be ready to fire at any game\r\nwhich he had a reasonable chance of hitting. One day while he was thus\r\nkeeping a sharp lookout for anything which gave promise of a meal,\r\nChenowagesic pointed excitedly to a small, black spot just showing above\r\nthe water, and told the Captain it was an otter. The Captain fired, and\r\nto the gratification of all, the animal turned over on its back dead.\r\nThat day they were unable to bag anything else, and when they encamped\r\nfor the night the Indians prepared the otter for supper. At first the\r\nwhite members of the party refused to share the meal, but hunger was too\r\nmuch for them, and so, conquering their prejudices, they satisfied their\r\nappetites with the meat, which probably resembles cat meat more nearly\r\nthan any other kind. The next day the Indians managed to kill several\r\nducks by driving them under the water and then spearing them with their\r\npaddles; and the Captain's brother, having improvised a very ingenious\r\ntrolling hook, succeeded in catching two fish. The main part of their\r\ndiet, however, for four long days, consisted simply of blue berries, and\r\nCaptain Glazier became so weak from hunger and exhaustion that he was\r\nbarely able to sit upright. At last they met an Indian, a few miles from\r\nLake Bemidji, who supplied them with dried fish and other provisions,\r\nand that night they encamped on the shores of the lake.\r\n\r\nThe next day they pursued their voyage under more favorable\r\ncircumstances, the larder being tolerably well supplied, the river free\r\nfrom obstructions, and flowing between beautiful groves and rich\r\nmeadows. Late in the afternoon they reached Cass Lake, where they\r\npitched their tents for the night, and the following day found them at\r\nLake Winnibegoshish, the largest expansion of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nTheir arrival at this lake was at a time when a strong south wind blew\r\nthe waters into white-capped waves, which ran very high, and the canoes\r\nwere nearly swamped before they could be forced into the little bay upon\r\nthe shores of which the Indian village stands. This village consists of\r\nabout a dozen wigwams and log-houses, and presents nothing more inviting\r\nthan a fine view of this beautiful lake. An Indian missionary named\r\nKit-chi-no-din is stationed here, and treated the party with marked\r\ncourtesy and hospitality, although he could speak but very little\r\nEnglish. During the two days in which they were wind-bound and obliged\r\nto remain inactive, the Captain took several meals with him, and once\r\nattended service in the little log-church of which he had been installed\r\nrector by Bishop Whipple.\r\n\r\nDuring their enforced stay at Lake Winnibegoshish, Chenowagesic bade\r\nfarewell to Captain Glazier and returned to his home at Leech Lake.\r\nEvery effort was made by the Captain, who had found him invaluable as a\r\nguide, to persuade him to continue the voyage with them; but his mind\r\nwas so filled with the legends he had heard of the Lower Mississippi\r\nthat no inducement could prevail with him. The Indians of these northern\r\nregions very commonly believe that the eddies and whirlpools found in\r\nthe river further down its course are mysterious monsters, and that the\r\nsurrounding country is full of strange animals and fearful sights.\r\n\r\nOn the third day of their stay at the village, the wind moderated\r\nsomewhat and they made an attempt to coast along part of the lake,\r\nhoping to reach the outlet in that way. But after struggling with the\r\nwaves all the morning they came to a small inlet, and were forced by the\r\nagain increasing wind to seek shelter in it.\r\n\r\nThe next morning another start was made, and, after some very rough\r\npaddling, the party at length arrived at the outlet of the lake, and\r\nfrom thence pursued the even tenor of their way without any further\r\ninterruption until they reached Pokegama Falls, two miles and a half\r\nabove Grand Rapids. Here they found a number of white men, the first\r\nthey had seen since leaving Leech Lake, encamped and engaged in building\r\na small steamboat to run up to Lake Winnibegoshish. After a portage\r\naround the Falls they entered Grand Rapids, where they were rejoiced to\r\nfind a post-office, a hotel called the Potter House, and a few other\r\nevidences of civilization, such as a comfortable bed, the first they had\r\nslept in for many days.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Grand Rapids nothing of any importance occurred until\r\nAitkin was reached, four days later, unless we except meeting the first\r\nsteamboat they had seen on the river. This was quite an exciting event,\r\nfor the passengers on the boat knowing from the papers that Captain\r\nGlazier's party were on their way to Aitkin, recognized them, and\r\ntestified their pleasure in the meeting by cheering, waving their\r\nhandkerchiefs and hats, and calling after the explorers kind wishes for\r\ntheir safety and success.\r\n\r\nAt Aitkin, the most northern town on the Mississippi, a brief rest was\r\ntaken before the Captain embarked on the second stage of his seaward\r\nvoyage. He had now entered the bounds of civilization, and from this\r\npoint the principal incidents of his expedition were such as would\r\nnaturally occur in a country where the people delight to honor\r\nenterprise, courage and ambition. All along the route great enthusiasm\r\nwas evinced. When it was announced through the medium of the press at\r\nwhat time he would reach a given point, the inhabitants flocked to the\r\nlanding-place to do him honor; and many, more impatient than the rest,\r\nwould put out in canoes and skiffs to meet him on the way. Upon\r\ndisembarking he would be escorted to his hotel, usually preceded by a\r\nband playing \"Hail to the Chief\" or other appropriate airs, and wherever\r\nhe delivered his lecture large audiences greeted him, curious to see and\r\nhear the man who had at last discovered the source of the Mississippi,\r\nand who had come so far on its mighty waters in a frail canoe.\r\nEverywhere he charmed all who met him by the courtesy of his manners,\r\nthe eloquence and interest of his conversation, and the modesty with\r\nwhich he spoke of his important undertaking. Some, indeed, were\r\ndisappointed by his lecture, having hoped to hear an account of his\r\ndiscoveries. But while Captain Glazier might with perfect propriety have\r\nspoken of his own exploits after recounting in glowing terms those of\r\nthe old explorers, he is too modest and reserved to say aught which\r\nmight in the least seem to detract from the achievements of his heroic\r\npredecessors. Therefore, as his subject was the \"Pioneers of the\r\nMississippi,\" he spoke only of their exploits, giving them in eloquent\r\nwords their just tribute of praise, and leaving it to others to say that\r\nwhat _they_ had only begun _he_ had triumphantly finished.\r\n\r\nUpon leaving Aitkin on the fifteenth of August the birch bark canoes,\r\nwith the exception of the one used by the Captain himself, were\r\nabandoned, their places being taken by a Rushton canoe, named \"Alice,\"\r\nafter his daughter, and a Racine canoe of the Rob Roy pattern. Their\r\ndeparture from this thriving little city was the signal for an\r\nenthusiastic demonstration on the part of its inhabitants, who\r\ncongregated on the shore to see them off. Captain Glazier acknowledged\r\nthe compliment in a short speech, and then, stepping into his canoe, the\r\nlittle flotilla paddled away amidst the cheers of the multitude.\r\n\r\nFrom this point the descent of the river was comparatively easy. Except\r\nwhen rainy weather or violent winds prevailed, the voyagers found much\r\nto enjoy in the novel life they were leading, the varying scenery they\r\nmet, and the altogether different phase which the Mississippi, the great\r\nwaterway of internal commerce in North America, presented to them.\r\n\r\nAt Brainerd the Captain delivered his lecture for the first time, to a\r\ncrowded and appreciative audience. From Brainerd the party dropped down\r\nthe river to the antiquated town of Crow-Wing, opposite the mouth of the\r\nCrow-Wing River. Remaining here over night they re-embarked next\r\nmorning, and gliding down the stream arrived at about three o'clock in\r\nthe afternoon at a point just above Little Falls. Here they were met by\r\na number of row-boats and escorted to the town. As the little fleet\r\napproached the land the shores were seen to be crowded with people, and\r\nthe band struck up, merrily \"A Life on the Ocean Wave,\" \"See the\r\nConquering Hero comes,\" and other complimentary airs. As soon as a\r\nlanding was effected, cries of \"Captain Glazier! Captain Glazier! a\r\nspeech! a speech!\" went up, and in response to the demand the Captain\r\nmade a few remarks. First, thanking them for the kind interest\r\nmanifested in his voyage, he continued: \"I find a great deal of\r\nspeculation as I go down the river in regard to the objects of this\r\nexpedition, and it may be well to state what they really are. My desire\r\nis to study thoroughly the people, industries, and general features of\r\nthe grandest valley in the world--a valley which extends from the great\r\nwatershed almost on the northern boundary of the United States to the\r\nGulf of Mexico, a distance of three thousand miles, and where the\r\noccupations of the people change from the lumbering and fur-hunting of\r\nthe north to the cotton and sugar-raising of the south. To do this\r\ncarefully and at leisure I take a method of traveling by which I can\r\ndevote as much time as is necessary to every section of the river, and\r\nby which I can observe from a standpoint not reached by the ordinary\r\ntraveler. This, ladies and gentlemen, is why you see me to-day\r\ndescending the Mississippi in a canoe.\"\r\n\r\nThe Captain was then escorted to his hotel by the band, and in the\r\nevening delivered his lecture at Vasaly Hall, continuing his voyage the\r\nfollowing day. Between this point and Minneapolis numerous and dangerous\r\nrapids were met, all of which were passed in safety, and the Falls of\r\nSt. Anthony were reached without accident. Below these Falls the scenery\r\nwas very beautiful, although the immense number of rain storms\r\ninterfered sadly with the pleasure of sight-seeing.\r\n\r\nWhen the party arrived at Lake Pepin, a beautiful body of water, thirty\r\nmiles in length and three in breadth, and surrounded by majestic bluffs,\r\nthey found navigation almost impossible. The winds sweeping down between\r\nthe bluffs caused the waves to rise so high that even the river steamers\r\nhad been compelled to tie up and wait for the storm to subside. The\r\nCaptain, however, had an engagement to lecture at Lake City, half way\r\ndown the lake, and as he had never yet failed to appear at the appointed\r\ntime he now insisted upon attempting to reach his destination. The\r\nriver men in vain endeavored to dissuade him from his purpose. It took\r\nall day to make a pull of sixteen miles, and many a time it seemed as if\r\nthe frail canoes would certainly be swamped; but nevertheless they\r\narrived at Lake City in time for the lecture. And it may be mentioned\r\nhere that in this voyage, as in his journey from Ocean to Ocean, he\r\nseldom failed to keep an engagement to lecture. No matter what the\r\nstress of weather or unforeseen accident which would have delayed most\r\nmen, he surmounted every obstacle and invariably appeared on the\r\nplatform at the appointed hour.\r\n\r\nBad weather, violent squalls, and dangerous rapids were of frequent\r\noccurrence, but nothing succeeded in crippling the energy which Captain\r\nGlazier had all along exhibited. His mind was bent upon reaching the\r\nGulf in his canoe, and he pursued his course unmindful of the dangers\r\nwhich he almost daily encountered. At La Crosse the expedition was\r\nreduced in number to the Captain and Mr. Paine, who, for the remainder\r\nof the voyage, used the \"Alice.\"\r\n\r\nSt. Louis was reached on the eighth of October, and the voyagers were\r\nheartily welcomed by the various boat-clubs of the city and by many\r\ninfluential citizens. On October the tenth, they re-embarked and\r\ncontinued their voyage towards the Gulf.\r\n\r\nFrom here Cairo, Memphis, Vicksburg, Natchez, and Baton Rouge were the\r\nchief halting-places, although many a time night overtook them before\r\nthey could reach a town or city, and then they would be entertained at\r\nsome plantation near the shore with true southern hospitality.\r\nEverywhere they were received with the utmost cordiality. The various\r\ncities along the banks of the river seemed to vie with each other in\r\ndoing honor to Captain Glazier; the press spoke in the highest terms of\r\nhis expedition and of his great success, and every opportunity was\r\nafforded him to make the most minute observations respecting the\r\ncustoms, manner of life, business enterprise, and political condition of\r\nthe people of the different States. These observations he proposed to\r\nembody in a work to be entitled \"Down the Great River\"--a work which, in\r\nthe light of the Captain's well-known facility as a writer, cannot fail\r\nto be both interesting and instructive.\r\n\r\nNew Orleans was reached at last, but as the Captain intended to return\r\nthere after visiting Port Eads, no stop was made, and the \"Alice\"\r\npaddled past the Crescent City, arriving at the Jetties on the fifteenth\r\nof November, one hundred and seventeen days after beginning the descent\r\nof the river from its new found source, Lake Glazier.\r\n\r\nMany citizens of Port Eads had assembled in small boats at the entrance\r\nto the Gulf to see the \"Alice\" and her gallant crew in the act of\r\ncompleting their long voyage. Cheer upon cheer rent the air as the\r\nbeautiful little canoe, bearing aloft at the bow a pennant with the\r\ninscription \"Alice,\" and at the stern the glorious \"Stars and Stripes,\"\r\npaddled from the mouth of the river out into the wide expanse of the\r\nGulf. Guns were discharged, flags enthusiastically waved, and every\r\npossible demonstration made which could give expression to the\r\nexcitement of the occasion.\r\n\r\nReaching the beacon, the Captain and Mr. Paine disembarked, and,\r\nclambering up on the wall, gazed out on the salt waters of the Gulf,\r\nhardly able to realize that this was actually the goal towards which\r\nthey had been slowly paddling for almost four months.\r\n\r\nThus ended the longest canoe voyage on record. De Soto, Marquette, La\r\nSalle, Hennepin, Joliet, and Schoolcraft, had all navigated sections of\r\nthe Mississippi, but Captain Glazier was the first to traverse its\r\nentire course, from the remotest headwaters to the outlet, a distance of\r\nthree thousand one hundred and eighty-four miles. This, too, he had done\r\nin a frail canoe, amidst heavy rains and violent winds, in heat and\r\ncold, in sunshine and in storm, steadily pursuing his course,\r\nunfaltering in his purpose, deterred by no danger, determined only on\r\nsuccess. In the wilds of Minnesota he stood by the beautiful little lake\r\nwhose placid bosom first nourishes the infant stream. Paddling onward\r\nwith the current, ever increasing in strength and volume, he passed from\r\nthe dense forests of the North where nature holds undisputed sway, into\r\nthe realms of a civilization growing daily greater and greater. Finally\r\nhe reached the broad Gulf, in which the \"Father of Waters,\" now strong\r\nin the strength of maturity, and vast in his proportions, pours his\r\nmighty flood. Every variety of climate, soil and production came under\r\nhis observation, and all the striking peculiarities of the Northern,\r\nWestern and Southern character. No other man had ever accomplished this,\r\nand therefore it is not difficult to imagine that Captain Glazier's\r\nemotions, when he first saw the salt spray of the Gulf dash high over\r\nthe seaward wall of the Jetties, were of an elevated order, and lifted\r\nhim for the time above the plane of every-day life. His long voyage was\r\ncompleted, the objective at which he had aimed was reached, and his\r\nplans had all been attended with success. Of little consequence now\r\nwere the dangers he had encountered, the annoyances which had beset him,\r\nthe difficulties he had surmounted. He was proud of the fact that he was\r\nthe first to stand at the fountain-head of his country's grandest river,\r\nand was the first to traverse its entire course despite the turbulent\r\nwaters and dangerous whirlpools which threatened often to engulf him,\r\nand now at its outlet could write \"finis\" to the great work of his life.\r\nFew men in the world can say as much--for the energy, perseverance,\r\nunfaltering will and indomitable courage which characterize Willard\r\nGlazier are of rare occurrence, and entitle him to a prominent position\r\nin the ranks of America's distinguished sons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECEPTION BY THE NEW ORLEANS ACADEMY OF SCIENCES.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Captain Glazier returns to New Orleans.--A general ovation.--\r\n    Flattering opinions of the press.--Introduction to the Mayor.--\r\n    Freedom of the City tendered.--Special meeting of the New Orleans\r\n    Academy of Sciences.--Presentation of the \"Alice\" to the\r\n    Academy.--Captain Glazier's address.--The President's Response.--\r\n    Resolutions of thanks and appreciation passed.--Visit to the\r\n    Arsenal of the Washington Artillery.--Welcome by the Old Guard of\r\n    the Louisiana Tigers.--Pleasant memories of the \"Crescent City.\"\r\n\r\nAfter standing for some time looking out upon the vast expanse of water\r\nwhich lay before him, Captain Glazier hailed a passing boat and, towing\r\nthe \"Alice\" after them, he and Mr. Paine were rowed back to Port Eads.\r\nHere they were very hospitably entertained until the arrival of the\r\nhomeward-bound steamship \"Margaret,\" which they boarded and on which\r\nthey returned to New Orleans. There they met with the most cordial\r\nreception; people everywhere were curious to see Captain Glazier, and\r\nanxious to show their appreciation of his enterprising spirit and the\r\nsuccess which had attended his last remarkable exploit. The press, not\r\nonly of New Orleans, but all through the Mississippi Valley, gave\r\nglowing accounts of his voyage and of the reception tendered him at its\r\nconclusion. The Mayor offered him the freedom of the city, and the New\r\nOrleans Academy of Sciences gave him a public reception, at which\r\nresolutions were passed recognizing the important results of his\r\nexpedition, and thanking him for the beautiful canoe \"Alice,\" which he\r\nhad presented to that learned body.\r\n\r\nThe following account of this reception is taken from the \"_St. Louis\r\nRepublican_\" of November twenty-eighth, and is presented to the reader\r\nbecause, being the testimony of an eye-witness, it cannot fail to give a\r\nclear idea of the manner in which the scientists of the city, and the\r\npeople generally, appreciated Captain Glazier and the work which he had\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  [Correspondence of the _Republican_.]\r\n\r\n                                      \"New Orleans, _November 23, 1881_.\r\n\r\n\"The termination of the noted and unprecedented exploring expedition and\r\ncanoe trip of the Soldier-Author, Captain Willard Glazier, extending\r\nfrom his new-found true source of the mighty Mississippi River to the\r\nGulf of Mexico, culminated, after one hundred and seventeen days'\r\nvoyage, in a very general and complimentary recognition and ovation on\r\nthe part of the officials and distinguished citizens of New Orleans. In\r\ncompany with Dr. J. S. Copes, President of the Academy of Sciences, the\r\nsuccessful explorer was presented to his honor, Mayor Shakespear, and\r\nwas by him warmly welcomed, and the freedom of the city generously\r\ntendered him. In appreciative recognition of the hospitality extended\r\nhim the distinguished soldier, author, and explorer, felt it a pleasing\r\nas well as an appropriate opportunity to present his beautiful canoe,\r\nwhich had safely carried him through his long and perilous voyage, to\r\nthe New Orleans Academy of Sciences. The occasion of the presentation\r\nand acceptance was one of high order and much manifest interest. In\r\npresenting the canoe Captain Glazier tendered the following letter:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                               \"St. Charles Hotel,\r\n                                     New Orleans, _November 21, 1881_.\r\n       Joseph S. Copes, M. D.\r\n         President New Orleans Academy of Sciences:\r\n\r\n     Dear Sir:--I have just concluded upon the border of the State of\r\n     Louisiana, a voyage of observation and exploration; and as you have\r\n     expressed considerable interest in the results of my expedition,\r\n     and manifested a desire to possess the canoe in which the\r\n     explorations were made, I find pleasure in presenting it to your\r\n     honorable society as a souvenir of my voyage and discoveries.\r\n\r\n     During this canoe journey of over three thousand miles, beginning\r\n     at the headwaters of the Mississippi and extending to the Gulf of\r\n     Mexico, I had the satisfaction of locating the source of the Great\r\n     River which we have traversed, and feel a pride in having corrected\r\n     a geographical error of half a century's standing.\r\n\r\n     I will not now enter into a detailed account of my explorations on\r\n     the Upper Mississippi, but shall take the earliest opportunity of\r\n     transmitting to your secretary a complete history of the voyage,\r\n     which will be issued in book form as soon as the matter can be\r\n     prepared for publication.\r\n\r\n                                            Very respectfully yours,\r\n                                                      Willard Glazier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A special meeting of the Academy of Sciences was held at No. 46\r\nCarondelet street, Dr. J. S. Copes, president, in the chair, for the\r\npurpose of receiving from Captain Willard Glazier the handsome cedar\r\ncanoe 'Alice,' with which he navigated the Mississippi River from Aitkin\r\nto the Gulf.\r\n\r\n\"By invitation Captain Glazier gave an account of his explorations on\r\nthe Upper Mississippi and especially of that section of country beyond\r\nLake Itasca, which body of water has hitherto been considered the\r\nfountain-head of the Great River.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Copes in the name of the Academy thanked Captain Glazier for his\r\nvaluable gift, which would be highly prized, and then congratulated the\r\nexplorer upon his contribution to American geographical knowledge,\r\ncomparing him with De Soto, Marquette, La Salle, Hennepin, and Joliet,\r\nwhose highest fame was connected with discoveries relating to the\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\n\"In the course of his remarks the learned doctor said that De Soto\r\npenetrated the continent of North America in pursuit of gold and\r\naccidentally discovered the Mississippi. Marquette, the zealous\r\nmissionary, traversed the river from the mouth of the Wisconsin to the\r\nmouth of the Arkansas. La Salle pursued his explorations from the mouth\r\nof the Illinois to the Gulf, his sole aim seeming to be the conquest of\r\nNorth America in the name of the King of France. Hennepin explored but a\r\nsmall section of the stream, extending from the mouth of the Wisconsin\r\nto St. Anthony's Falls, while Captain Glazier has made the important\r\ndiscovery of its primal reservoir and traversed its entire length from\r\nsource to sea.\r\n\r\n\"The members of the Academy listened with great interest to Captain\r\nGlazier's graphic account of his discovery, and also to the intellectual\r\nand historical address of Dr. Copes.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. J. R. Walker then offered the following resolutions:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved:_--That the thanks of this Academy are due and are hereby\r\n     tendered to Captain Willard Glazier for the donation of his\r\n     beautiful canoe \"Alice,\" and for the brief narrative of his\r\n     explorations at the source of the Mississippi River, and of his\r\n     voyage thence to the Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved:_--That this Academy not only gratefully accepts this\r\n     handsome gift, but promises to preserve and cherish it as a\r\n     souvenir of Captain Glazier's high qualities as an explorer and\r\n     contributor to the increase of American geographical knowledge.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. H. Dudley Coleman moved as an amendment thereto that a copy of the\r\nresolutions be appropriately written and framed, and presented to\r\nCaptain Glazier, and that a committee of three be appointed to prepare\r\nthe same in accordance therewith.\r\n\r\n\"The resolutions as amended were unanimously adopted, when Dr. Copes\r\nappointed as the committee, Messrs. Coleman, Walker, and Blanchard.\r\n\r\n\"The suggestion made by Mr. Coleman that the canoe remain at the arsenal\r\nof the Battalion Washington Artillery until such time as the Academy\r\nprepare a suitable place for it was acceded to.\r\n\r\n\"At the conclusion of the meeting Mr. Coleman escorted Captain Glazier\r\nto the Washington Artillery Arsenal, and introduced him to Colonel J. B.\r\nRichardson, commanding the battalion, who accepted for the command the\r\ncare of the canoe, and extended to Captain Glazier the hospitalities of\r\nthe battalion during his stay in the city. Colonel Richardson and Mr.\r\nColeman then took him around the arsenal and showed him its attractive\r\nfeatures.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt will be readily seen from this letter that the members of the New\r\nOrleans Academy of Sciences were much impressed with the importance of\r\nthe discovery Captain Glazier had made. The resolutions which they\r\npassed were afterwards handsomely framed and sent to him at St. Louis.\r\n\r\nAmong the many courtesies which were tendered the Captain during his\r\nstay in New Orleans, he perhaps felt most deeply the royal welcome which\r\nwas given him by the Old Guard of the Louisiana Tigers. In his own words\r\n\"they could not do too much\" for him, and when we remember that only\r\ntwenty years have passed away since these brave men and the gallant\r\nUnion soldier fought on opposite sides on the battlefields of Virginia,\r\nit cannot be wondered at that he was much impressed with the cordiality\r\nof his reception by his former foes.\r\n\r\nAt the headquarters of the Washington Artillery, too, he found many who\r\nas Confederate officers and soldiers had formerly been his opponents in\r\nthe war, but nothing could exceed the heartiness of their welcome and\r\nthe good-fellowship which they displayed. They showed him their old\r\nbattle-flags still religiously kept, but a moment afterwards pointed to\r\nthe Stars and Stripes which occupied a prominent position in the room.\r\nAltogether Captain Glazier found it difficult to realize that there had\r\never been other than the most cordial feeling between the North and\r\nSouth, and this as much as anything else tended to make his stay in New\r\nOrleans a pleasure which he will long remember.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEFORE THE MISSOURI HISTORICAL SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Return to St. Louis.--Lecture at Mercantile Library\r\n    Hall.--Brilliant audience.--The Missouri Historical Society\r\n    present.--Eloquent introduction by Judge Todd.--\"Pioneers of the\r\n    Mississippi.\"--Presentation of the \"Itasca\" to the Historical\r\n    Society.--Remarks of Captain Silas Bent on accepting the\r\n    canoe.--Congratulations of the audience.--Closing scene.\r\n\r\nOn leaving New Orleans Captain Glazier returned to St. Louis, having an\r\nengagement there to deliver his lecture on the \"Pioneers of the\r\nMississippi.\" He had been unable to remain long enough for this purpose\r\nduring his previous visit to the city on his way down the river, as\r\nwinter was rapidly approaching and it was expedient to reach the Gulf as\r\nsoon as possible. Therefore, as many were anxious to hear a lecture\r\nwhich had been so highly spoken of by the press of other cities, he had\r\nbeen induced to return with this object in view.\r\n\r\nHe was also desirous of presenting one of his canoes, the \"Itasca,\" to\r\nthe Missouri Historical Society in recognition of the unbounded\r\nhospitality he had enjoyed at the hands of the citizens of St. Louis,\r\nand it was decided that the donation of the canoe, a beautiful specimen\r\nof the Rob Roy pattern, should take place on the night of the lecture.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on the evening of January fourteenth, a large audience\r\nconsisting of members of the Historical Society, Academy of Sciences,\r\nclergy, officers and teachers of the public schools, and the various\r\nboat clubs of the city, assembled at Mercantile Library Hall to listen\r\nto his thrilling lecture on the pioneer explorers of the Mississippi,\r\nand to witness the formalities of the presentation.\r\n\r\nAt eight o'clock, Captain Glazier, accompanied by Judge Albert Todd, an\r\neminent lawyer, and vice-president of the Historical Society, made his\r\nappearance on the platform, and, after the storm of applause which\r\ngreeted their entry had subsided, Judge Todd stepped to the front and\r\nintroduced the lecturer in the following terms:--\r\n\r\n     Mark Twain wrote that in his oriental travels he visited the grave\r\n     of our common ancestor, Adam, and as a filial mourner he copiously\r\n     wept over it. To me, the grave of our common ancestress, Eve, would\r\n     be more worthy of my filial affection; but instead of weeping over\r\n     it, I should proudly rejoice by reason of her irrepressible desire\r\n     for knowledge. She boldly gratified this desire, and thereby lifted\r\n     Adam up from the indolent, browsing life that he seemed disposed\r\n     and content to pass in the \"Garden,\" and gave birth to that spirit\r\n     of inquiry and investigation which is developing and elevating\r\n     their posterity to \"man's pride of place\"--\"a little lower than the\r\n     angels,\" by keeping them ever discontented with the status quo, and\r\n     constantly pressing on to the \"mark of their high calling\" beneath\r\n     the blazing legend \"Excelsior.\" It is the ceaseless unrest of the\r\n     spirit, one of the greatest evidences of the soul's immortality,\r\n     that is continually contracting the boundaries of the unknown in\r\n     geography and astronomy, in physics and metaphysics, in all their\r\n     varied departments. Of those pre-eminently illustrating it in\r\n     geography were Jason and his Argonauts; Columbus, De Gama and\r\n     Magellan; De Soto, Marquette and La Salle; Cabot and Cook; Speke,\r\n     Baker, Livingstone and Franklin; and our own Ledyard, Lewis,\r\n     Clarke, Kane, Hall and Stanley. And this evening will appear\r\n     before you another of these irrepressible _discontents_ who would\r\n     know what is still hidden at any risk or privation.\r\n\r\n     Impelled by this spirit of enterprise in search of Truth, Captain\r\n     Willard Glazier has discovered, at last, the true source of our\r\n     grand and peerless river, the \"Father of Waters,\" down which he has\r\n     floated and paddled in frail canoes, a distance of more than three\r\n     thousand miles, to its mouth in the Gulf of Mexico. One of these\r\n     canoes is now placed here in your view, and will be presented\r\n     to-night by its navigator to our Historical Society.\r\n\r\n     Nearly two hundred years ago La Salle discovered the mouth of the\r\n     Mississippi, yet only now in this year of grace, 1881, was\r\n     ascertained its true fountain source.\r\n\r\n     This, the latest achievement of Captain Glazier, is only in the\r\n     natural course of his antecedents. Born as late as 1841, he has\r\n     already gone through the experiences of the Adamic labors of a\r\n     tiller of the soil, the hard toils of the student and of the\r\n     successful teacher; of the dashing and brilliant cavalry officer in\r\n     the Union army through the whole period of our late war, from its\r\n     disastrous beginning to its successful ending; of the sufferings of\r\n     capture and imprisonment in the notorious \"Libby\" and other\r\n     prisons, and of a daring and perilous escape from their cruel\r\n     walls; of an adventurous tourist on horseback through the most\r\n     civilized and savage portions of our continent, beginning with the\r\n     feet of his horse in the waters of the Atlantic, and ending with\r\n     their splash in the waters of the Pacific. He delivered lectures\r\n     along his route wherever a civilized audience could be collected,\r\n     and suffered capture by the Indians, with all its sensational\r\n     romance and hideous prospects.\r\n\r\n     From the material of these antecedents he has written and published\r\n     several books of singular interest and national value.\r\n\r\n     From this brief sketch we would naturally expect to see a stalwart\r\n     man, massive and powerful in form and muscle. Our conception of men\r\n     of big deeds is that they also are big. But David was a stripling\r\n     when he slew Goliath of Gath. Napoleon was characterized by the\r\n     society ladies of the period of his early career as \"Puss in\r\n     Boots.\" Our own Fremont and Eads would seem at sight capable of\r\n     only the ordinarily exposed duties of life. Of like physique is the\r\n     subject of this introduction.\r\n\r\n     Ladies and gentlemen, it is now my pleasant privilege to introduce\r\n     to your acquaintance Captain Willard Glazier as the lecturer for\r\n     the evening.\r\n\r\nAt the close of Judge Todd's introduction, Captain Glazier began his\r\ninstructive historic lecture on the \"Pioneers of the Mississippi,\"\r\nholding the attention of all present by the interest of his subject and\r\nthe eloquence of his delivery. Beginning with De Soto, the discoverer of\r\nthe Great River, he gave an account of his early life and adventures, of\r\nhis ambition to found an empire like that of Cortez, and of his arrival\r\nat the mighty stream in whose waters he soon found his final\r\nresting-place.\r\n\r\nMarquette, the self-sacrificing missionary, was brought vividly before\r\nthe mind's eye of the hearer as the Captain described in glowing terms\r\nthe zeal with which he preached the Gospel to the poor benighted\r\nIndians, and drew a picture with all its poetical surroundings of his\r\ndeath and burial in the wilderness.\r\n\r\nLa Salle came next, pushing onward down the river until he planted his\r\ntriumphant banner on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, and took\r\npossession of the surrounding country in the name of the King of France.\r\nHennepin and Joliet then claimed the attention of the eloquent speaker,\r\nand their exploits were clearly and forcibly recounted in graphic\r\nlanguage. Other explorers were mentioned, but these formed the\r\nground-work of the lecture--a lecture replete with historical interest,\r\nand crowded with such a vivid portrayal of incidents that from beginning\r\nto end one can see as in a panorama the Great River and all the mighty\r\nmen whose fame is indissolubly connected with the history of its\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the lecture the following letter to the President\r\nof the Historical Society was read:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  1310 Olive Street,\r\n                                         St. Louis, _January 14, 1882_.\r\n\r\n     Edwin Harrison, Esq.,\r\n        President Missouri Historical Society:\r\n\r\n     Dear Sir:--In my recent canoe voyage down the Mississippi, it was\r\n     my good fortune to receive many courtesies at the hands of the\r\n     press, boat clubs, and other citizens of St. Louis. This, coupled\r\n     with the fact that you have expressed considerable interest in the\r\n     result of my explorations, inclines me to present to you the\r\n     \"Itasca,\" one of the canoes used in the expedition, for the Museum\r\n     of your Society, as a memento of my voyage and discoveries.\r\n\r\n     During this tour of observation and exploration, extending from the\r\n     headwaters of the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico, I had\r\n     the satisfaction of locating the true source of the mighty stream\r\n     down which we paddled our canoes to the sea.\r\n\r\n     I am not now in a position to give you a detailed account of my\r\n     explorations on the Great River, but shall avail myself of the\r\n     earliest opportunity to transmit to your Secretary a complete\r\n     history of the voyage, which will be issued in book form as soon as\r\n     the matter can be put in proper shape for publication.\r\n\r\n                                             Very truly yours,\r\n                                                       Willard Glazier.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn response to this letter Captain Silas Bent, late of the United States\r\nNavy, accepted for the Society the canoe in these words:\r\n\r\n     Captain Glazier:--It becomes my pleasant duty to accept for the\r\n     Missouri Historical Society this beautiful canoe, which has itself\r\n     become historic by reason of the service it has rendered you. It\r\n     shall be deposited with other treasured relics in our museum.\r\n\r\n     I have also to express to you the high appreciation in which the\r\n     Society holds the valuable contributions to geographical knowledge\r\n     resulting from your explorations among the headwaters of the\r\n     Mississippi River, and your discovery of the remotest lake that\r\n     contributes to the perennial birth of this hydra-headed \"Father of\r\n     Waters,\" whose Genesis near the Arctic regions gives it a length of\r\n     more than three thousand miles to the tropical gulf, to which it\r\n     bears upon its ample bosom in safety the freightage of an empire.\r\n\r\n     I desire, too, to thank you for the interesting lecture just given\r\n     us upon the achievements of the heroic old explorers, who have in\r\n     centuries past preceded you in investigations of the\r\n     characteristics of this river. But whilst past investigations have\r\n     made us familiar with the general character of the stream, and the\r\n     peculiarities of its many mouths, yet we know very little of its\r\n     source; and should be gratified I am sure if you could give us this\r\n     evening a brief account of the circumstances attending your\r\n     explorations in that direction, and of the difficulties you had to\r\n     encounter in the accomplishment of your object.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with Captain Bent's request that he would give some\r\naccount of the events connected with his discovery of the source of the\r\nMississippi, Captain Glazier, greatly to the satisfaction of his large\r\nand appreciative audience, now briefly narrated the leading incidents in\r\nhis voyage of exploration.\r\n\r\nWhen he had concluded his personal narrative many came forward to\r\ncongratulate him upon his discovery, and to express their appreciation\r\nof the great work he had accomplished. All inspected the \"Itasca,\" which\r\noccupied a prominent position on the platform, with the curiosity human\r\nnature invariably feels concerning any object closely connected with the\r\nfame of a distinguished man or daring exploit. The beautiful canoe was\r\nafterwards placed on exhibition at the rooms of the Historical Society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREETINGS OF THE VOYAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  An interesting souvenir.--Greeting at Lake Glazier.--Petition to\r\n    Geographical Societies.--Voice from Aitkin, Gate City of the\r\n    Upper Mississippi.--Tributes from Brainerd.--An old friend at La\r\n    Crosse.--Welcome at Davenport.--Greetings at St. Louis.--Senator\r\n    Lamar.--Royal welcome at Bayou Tunica.--Sentiment of Port Eads.--\r\n    Congratulations of the officers of the \"Margaret.\"--Greetings from\r\n    New Orleans.--\"Fame's triple wreath.\"--Closing remarks.\r\n\r\nSuch an expedition as Captain Glazier has recently concluded inevitably\r\ngives birth to many souvenirs and trophies of the undertaking which are\r\nalways interesting, not only to their immediate recipient but also to\r\nthe public generally; for a man of his calibre is in one sense public\r\nproperty, and as such everything associated with any important\r\nenterprise of his, is loudly demanded by men of all classes without\r\nregard to what would be considered its privacy under other\r\ncircumstances. It was the author's good fortune to see such a souvenir\r\nof the voyage--an album in which are inscribed the autographs of eminent\r\nmen from various points along the entire route traversed, the first\r\nbeing dated at the source of the Mississippi, and the last on the shores\r\nof the Gulf of Mexico; and the thought occurred to him that this memento\r\nof the latest exploit in Captain Glazier's exciting life could not fail\r\nto be an object of some interest to the reader who had thus far followed\r\nthe soldier, author, and explorer in his eventful and successful\r\ncareer. He therefore obtained permission to make a few extracts from the\r\nlarge number before him, and these Greetings of the Voyage are now\r\npresented to the public as a fitting conclusion to the story of the\r\nCaptain's journey from source to sea.\r\n\r\nThe first in order is naturally that of Barrett Channing Paine, his\r\nconstant companion during the entire voyage. Standing by the\r\ndiscoverer's side at the fountain-head of the Great River, he wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                              Lake Glazier, Minnesota,\r\n                                               _July 22, 1881_.\r\n\r\n     My Dear Captain:--From this beautiful lake where the mighty\r\n     Mississippi rises, my best wishes follow you down the course of the\r\n     \"Father of Waters\" till it mingles its flood with the sea.\r\n\r\n                            Very truly yours,\r\n\r\n                                                Barrett Channing Paine.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe next quote a petition of Captain Glazier's companions to the\r\nGeographical Societies of the country, although it is not found in the\r\nalbum. It was published in the Missouri \"_Republican_\" and various other\r\nnewspapers, but being dated Schoolcraft Island, the first stopping place\r\nafter leaving the source of the river, it seems quite naturally to\r\nfollow the greeting of Mr. Paine:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                               Schoolcraft Island,\r\n                                       Lake Itasca, _July 22, 1881_.\r\n\r\n     To Geographical and Historical Societies:--We the undersigned,\r\n     companions of Captain Willard Glazier, in his voyage of exploration\r\n     to the headwaters of the Mississippi, are fully convinced that the\r\n     lake located by him is beyond question the source of the \"Father of\r\n     Waters.\"\r\n\r\n     The privilege of bestowing a name upon the new discovery having\r\n     been delegated to us, we hereby name it LAKE GLAZIER in honor of\r\n     the leader of the expedition, whose energy, perseverance and pluck\r\n     carried us through many difficulties and brought us at last to the\r\n     shores of this beautiful lake--the True Source of the Great River.\r\n\r\n     We respectfully petition all Geographical Societies to give it that\r\n     recognition which has heretofore been accorded to Lake Itasca, and\r\n     to which it is justly entitled as the primal reservoir of the\r\n     grandest river on this continent.\r\n\r\n           Barrett Channing Paine,      }\r\n               Indianapolis, Indiana.   }             _White_\r\n           George Herbert Glazier,      }          _Companions._\r\n               Chicago, Illinois.       }\r\n\r\n           Moses Lagard,                }          _Interpreter_\r\n           Chenowagesic,                }               _and_\r\n           Sebatise Lagard,             }             _Indian_\r\n               Leech Lake, Minnesota,   }             _Guides._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Aitkin, the first town of importance on the Upper\r\nMississippi, took great interest in the expedition, and did all they\r\ncould to show their appreciation of the intrepid explorers. The\r\nfollowing is from the pen of Warren Potter, one of the pioneer citizens\r\nof the place:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    Aitkin, Minnesota,\r\n                                                  _August 15, 1881_.\r\n\r\n     Captain Willard Glazier:--As you float in your birch canoe upon the\r\n     bosom of the \"Father of Waters\" toward the sea, remember Aitkin,\r\n     the Gate City of the Upper Mississippi.\r\n\r\n                            Yours very truly,\r\n\r\n                                                         Warren Potter.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrainerd, situated at the point where the Northern Pacific Railroad\r\ncrosses the Mississippi, is a thriving town, and has the honor of\r\npossessing the first newspaper encountered in the descent of the river.\r\nThis paper, the Brainerd \"_Tribune_,\" exhibited much cordial interest in\r\nCaptain Glazier and his successful explorations, and from time to time\r\npublished accounts of the voyage. The autographs of its editor, Arthur\r\nE. Chase, is found in the album, as is that of Hon. Chauncey B. Sleeper,\r\ndistrict attorney for the county, who introduced him to the first\r\naudience before which he delivered his lecture on the \"Pioneers of the\r\nMississippi:\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  Brainerd, Minnesota,\r\n                                                 _August 19, 1881_.\r\n\r\n     Dear Captain:--That your voyage down the Great \"Father of Waters\"\r\n     may be fraught with experiences both pleasant to yourself and\r\n     beneficial to the public; and that your undertaking may prove a\r\n     worthy epoch in American history, is the wish of\r\n\r\n                           Your sincere friend,\r\n\r\n                                                       Arthur E.

Evans introduced Captain Glazier to his\r\naudience on the evening of his lecture in that city, and wrote as\r\nfollows in the album:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 St. Cloud, Minnesota,\r\n                                                 _August 23, 1881_.\r\n\r\n     To Captain Glazier:--May your life voyage and your contemplated\r\n     voyage to the mouth of our Great River prove pleasant and\r\n     profitable.\r\n\r\n                                                           L.

Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Hastings, Captain Glazier was cordially and hospitably entertained by\r\nthe proprietor and editor of the Hastings \"_Gazette_,\" and other\r\nprominent citizens. On parting Mr. Todd writes the following in the\r\nalbum:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  Hastings, Minnesota,\r\n                                               _September 5, 1881_.\r\n\r\n     With the cordial good wishes of the \"_Gazette_\" for a prosperous\r\n     voyage to the Gulf.\r\n\r\n                               Fraternally,\r\n\r\n                                                           Irving Todd.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe friendly writer of the following is loyal to his State while\r\ngreeting the man who evokes the sentiment:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                      Davenport, Iowa,\r\n                                              _September 25, 1881_.\r\n\r\n     Dear Captain:--As you plough the \"Father of Waters\" in your frail\r\n     bark, think of \"Iowa the Beautiful.\"\r\n\r\n                                                    Charles G. Plummer.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Davenport, Iowa, Captain Glazier had the pleasure of again meeting\r\nColonel P. A. J. Russell, city editor of the \"_Democrat_.\" This\r\ngentleman had been the first to greet him on his arrival in that city\r\nduring his journey across the continent in 1876, and it was with much\r\ncordiality that he now shook hands with the Captain and congratulated\r\nhim upon the success of his latest expedition. But we will let him\r\nexpress his sentiments in his own language:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        Davenport, on the Mississippi,\r\n                                         _September 25, 1881_.\r\n     To Captain Glazier:\r\n\r\n    Safety and success--thus far\r\n      Adown this mighty stream;\r\n    May Heaven guard your progress still\r\n      And grant fulfilment of your dream.\r\n\r\n                                    Very truly yours, P. A. J. Russell.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first man to welcome Captain Glazier at La Crosse was Pearce Giles,\r\nan old acquaintance whom he had known for many years in the East. Mr.\r\nGiles tenders his congratulations in these words:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 La Crosse, Wisconsin,\r\n                                               _September 10, 1881_.\r\n\r\n     My Dear Captain:--I congratulate you on your important discovery of\r\n     the True Source of the Mississippi--a discovery which must\r\n     associate your name forever with the \"Father of Waters.\" The\r\n     intelligence, earnestness, pluck and persistence you have displayed\r\n     in this, as in numerous other ways, are such as to give you a place\r\n     among the great Americans who have not lived in vain for their\r\n     country.\r\n\r\n                         Always sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n                                                          Pearce Giles.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe visit to Trempealeau, on the left bank of the river, introduced the\r\ncanoeists to some extremely agreeable people, whose hearty and\r\ndisinterested welcome will be long remembered by Captain Glazier. The\r\nsentiment of one of them is thus kindly expressed:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                               Trempealeau, Wisconsin,\r\n                                               September 11, 1881.\r\n\r\n     Captain Glazier:--My best wishes follow you down the \"Father of\r\n     Waters\" and through Life's Voyage.\r\n\r\n                          Very sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n                                                        M. H. Melchior.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile at Bellevue, Captain Glazier was entertained most agreeably by\r\nHon. W. O. Evans, editor of the Bellevue \"_Republican_\" who welcomed him\r\non his arrival, and launched his canoe when he resumed his voyage. He\r\nseemed greatly interested in the Captain's explorations, and expressed\r\nhis interest in this manner:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       Bellevue, Iowa,\r\n                                                   September 18, 1881.\r\n\r\n     Dear Captain:--That health, wealth, success and perpetual youth may\r\n     attend you in all your grand schemes and enterprises through the\r\n     Voyage of Life is the wish of your new-made friend,\r\n\r\n                                                           W. O. Evans.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Hannibal, Captain Glazier landed and remained three days, during\r\nwhich interval he met one or two valued friends. Before launching his\r\ncanoe this entry found a place in the album:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   Hannibal, Missouri,\r\n                                                  _October 3, 1881_.\r\n\r\n     Dear Captain:--May the Mississippi--that Grand Old Patriarch of\r\n     Rivers--carry you safely to the Gulf!\r\n\r\n                                                           A. M. Paget.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"_Post-Dispatch_\" one of the leading newspapers of St. Louis, was\r\nforemost in publishing accounts of the explorer's voyage from the time\r\nhe left the headwaters of the Mississippi until he reached the Gulf, and\r\nhence the autograph of its editor, Colonel John A. Cockerill, now editor\r\nof the New York \"_World_,\" is of special interest:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  St. Louis, Missouri,\r\n                                                  _October 8, 1881_.\r\n\r\n     The \"_Post-Dispatch_,\" sailing on prosperous sea, sends greeting\r\n     and good wishes to Captain Glazier and all daring navigators.\r\n\r\n                                                     John A. Cockerill.\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas E. Garrett, of the staff of the \"_Republican_,\" inscribed the\r\nfollowing poetic tribute:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                           Missouri Republican Office,\r\n                                      St. Louis, _October 14, 1881_.\r\n\r\n    On land and water--staunch and true,\r\n    You steer and paddle your own canoe,\r\n    Strong arm, brave heart, will pull you through.\r\n\r\n                            Very truly yours,\r\n\r\n                                                     Thomas E. Garrett.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe editor of the Helena \"_Yeoman_\" writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     Helena, Arkansas,\r\n                                                 _October 22, 1881_.\r\n\r\n     Captain Glazier:--May your present voyage down the great\r\n     Mississippi redound to your credit, and add to the honors you have\r\n     already won.\r\n\r\n                                                     W. L. Morris,\r\n                                                    \"_Yeoman_\" Office.\r\n\r\n\r\nProf. J. J. Flahift, Superintendent of Public Instruction at Helena,\r\ngreets the navigator in these terms:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     Helena, Arkansas,\r\n                                                 _October_ 26, 1881.\r\n\r\n    \"Nothing great is lightly won,\r\n      Nothing won is lost;\r\n    Every good deed nobly done,\r\n      Will repay the cost;\r\n    Leave to Heaven in humble trust\r\n      All you will to do,\"\r\n    But, to reach the Gulf, you must\r\n      Paddle your own canoe.\r\n\r\n                                                         J. J. Flahift.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Natchez, Captain Glazier had the pleasure of hearing Senator Lamar\r\ndeliver a political speech, and was afterwards introduced to him at the\r\nFoster House, where both were registered. The Senator seemed much\r\ninterested in the Captain's explorations, and so signifies over his\r\nautograph:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 Natchez, Mississippi,\r\n                                                 _November_ 3, 1881.\r\n\r\n     Glad to have met you, Captain Glazier, and I leave with you my best\r\n     wishes for the success of your undertaking.\r\n\r\n                                                        L. Q. C. Lamar.\r\n\r\n\r\nBayou Tunica will always be held in pleasant remembrance by Captain\r\nGlazier, for he was there most hospitably received and entertained by\r\nJohn J. Winn, a prosperous merchant and planter. Mr. Winn insisted upon\r\nhis remaining with him for two days during the progress of a violent\r\nstorm which rendered the river unnavigable, and every effort was made to\r\nmake the time pass agreeably. His greeting to the explorer is short but\r\nto the point:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                              Bayou Tunica, Louisiana,\r\n                                               _November 5, 1881_.\r\n\r\n     Captain Glazier:--May your voyage to the Gulf be a pleasant one.\r\n\r\n                                                          John J. Winn.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Glazier's first acquaintance with a sugar plantation was made on\r\nreaching the estates of Messrs. V. U. Lefebre and son, who are\r\nextensively engaged in the production of this staple of commerce. This\r\nfirm is counted among the wealthiest sugar planters of Plaquemine\r\nParish, owning and controlling three large plantations. The Captain made\r\nthe most of his opportunity to learn something of the art of sugar\r\nmanufacture. The cane-field and sugar-mill and every detail were\r\nexplained by his polite host, from the cutting of the canes to the\r\nrefining process. The Captain and his companion were hospitably\r\nentertained an entire day, and on parting the senior Mr. Lefebre greeted\r\nhim in French, the tongue of his mother country:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                          Eliza Plantation, Louisiana,\r\n                                               _November_ 9, 1881.\r\n\r\n     Cher Capitaine:--J'espere que votre voyage au Golfe sera agreable\r\n     que vous garderes un bon souvenir de la Louisiane.\r\n\r\n                              Votre sincere,\r\n\r\n                                                         V. U. Lefebre.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Port Eads, the terminal point of the voyage,\r\ndisplayed, if possible, a more lively interest in the expedition than\r\nthose of any other town along the river, for here it was that the goal\r\nwas reached and the Captain's long and hazardous undertaking placed\r\nbeyond the risk of failure. Some description has already been given of\r\nthe triumphant manner in which the arrival of the \"Alice\" at the Gulf\r\nwas proclaimed by the people, and the following lines of F. C.\r\nWelschaus, one of the citizens, expresses, in all probability, the\r\ngeneral sentiment of Port Eads:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 Port Eads, Louisiana,\r\n                                                _November_ 15, 1881.\r\n\r\n     To THE DISCOVERER OF THE MISSISSIPPI'S SOURCE:--May all your\r\n     undertakings prove as successful as this one.\r\n\r\n                                                       F. C. Welschaus.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis kindly wish of Mr. Welschaus in reality concludes the greetings of\r\nthe voyage proper, but when Captain Glazier returned to New Orleans from\r\nPort Eads, and afterwards to St. Louis, others were added to the number,\r\nsome of which are of so much interest that the author takes pleasure in\r\nquoting them.\r\n\r\nThe first in point of time was written by the officers of the steamship\r\n_Margaret_, on board of which Captain Glazier steamed back to New\r\nOrleans. This vessel was engaged in the fruit trade between the Crescent\r\nCity and ports in Central America. His reception and entertainment by\r\nthe officers was characteristic of sailors in general, cordial and\r\nhospitable in the extreme. They expressed great wonder that a mere\r\nlandsman could make such an extended voyage in so small a boat, and many\r\nquestions were asked and answered upon this subject. Their farewell\r\ngreeting is thus entered in the album:\r\n\r\n\r\n              On Board Steamship \"_Margaret_,\" _November_ 16, 1881.\r\n\r\n     To Captain Willard Glazier:--We congratulate you upon the\r\n     successful completion of your great undertaking, and ask you to\r\n     accept the following as our sincere wish and fervent prayer:\r\n\r\n    \"May your bark of mortality\r\n    Glide down the stream of Time,\r\n    And land at last at that glorious haven\r\n    Where nothing reigns supreme\r\n    But joy, health, prosperity and happiness.\"\r\n\r\n                           John Otteson, _Commander_.\r\n                           Richard Hunter, _Chief Officer_.\r\n                           Albert J. Schlesinger, _Purser_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile in New Orleans, Captain Glazier had an opportunity to listen to a\r\nsermon by Rev. B. M. Palmer, a prominent clergyman of that city. The\r\nCaptain afterwards had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Palmer, who inscribed\r\nthis beautiful wish in the album:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                               New Orleans, Louisiana,\r\n                                              _November_ 22, 1881.\r\n\r\n     Captain Glazier:--May your exploration of the Mississippi from its\r\n     source to its mouth be typical of your Voyage of Life, as it rolls\r\n     with its swelling flood into the bosom of God.\r\n\r\n                    Yours in the Faith of the Gospel,\r\n\r\n                                                     B. M. Palmer,\r\n                                      Pastor First Presbyterian Church.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe greetings from New Orleans would be incomplete without some\r\nreference to H. Dudley Coleman, a member of the New Orleans Academy of\r\nSciences, and also of the Washington Artillery, of that city, who\r\nextended many courtesies to Captain Glazier. Mr. Coleman was a cavalry\r\nofficer in the Confederate Army, and his command had been frequently\r\nopposed to that of the Union soldier on the battle-fields of Virginia.\r\nHis Southern gallantry, however, prompted a cordial greeting, and the\r\ntrue gentleman appeared in the numerous attentions he showered on his\r\nformer adversary in arms. Captain Glazier was greatly impressed by this\r\ndisplay of good feeling, and the evident desire manifested on the part\r\nof many Southern gentlemen who received him to bury the animosities of\r\nthe late war and promote a state of harmony and cordial friendship. The\r\nblue and the grey are no longer estranged, or such a hearty reception\r\ncould not have been accorded to Captain Glazier, whose name and\r\nreputation were well known to many in the Crescent City as of a prolific\r\nwriter on military subjects from a Union standpoint. Mr. Coleman's\r\napparently sincere expressions of a deep friendly interest in the\r\nCaptain's exploits on the Mississippi impressed him very sensibly. Want\r\nof space must be our excuse for not including his long and very cordial\r\ngreeting in the album.\r\n\r\nAlbert G. Blanchard, also a member of the New Orleans Academy of\r\nSciences, and formerly a brigadier-general, C. S. A., shows his\r\nappreciation of the explorations which Captain Glazier had successfully\r\ncompleted in these terms:\r\n\r\n\r\n     I congratulate you on your successful exploration of the headwaters\r\n     of the Mississippi River. Your name will always be honored with\r\n     that of Robert Cavalier de la Salle, the discoverer of the outlet\r\n     of this river as you are of its source.\r\n\r\n                          Very respectfully your obedient servant,\r\n                                                Albert G. Blanchard,\r\n                                                Deputy City Surveyor.\r\n      New Orleans,\r\n           _November_ 22, 1881.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe next quote from the pen of Dr. J. S. Copes, the learned President of\r\nthe New Orleans Academy of Sciences. Dr. Copes manifested an intense\r\ninterest in the results of Captain Glazier's expedition, and endeavored\r\nby every method within his power to show the high estimation in which he\r\nheld the intrepid explorer:\r\n\r\n\r\n     Captain Glazier:--I congratulate you upon the successful completion\r\n     of your search for the primal reservoir of the Mississippi River.\r\n     It would be well for the country to erect before the view of its\r\n     youths and young men two monuments, three thousand miles\r\n     asunder--the one at the source, the other at the mouth of the great\r\n     river of North America--upon which should be chiseled \"Enterprise,\r\n     Courage, Faith, Fortitude, Patriotism, Philanthropy,\" leaving to\r\n     posterity the selection of an illustrative name to be engraven on\r\n     each one when events shall have pointed conclusively to the\r\n     benefactors most worthy of this honor.\r\n\r\n                                         With great respect,\r\n                                             Yours very truly,\r\n                                                    J. S. Copes,\r\n                        President New Orleans Academy of Sciences.\r\n       New Orleans,\r\n           _November_ 19, 1881.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will conclude this pleasing souvenir of the voyage by quoting the\r\nsentiment of Judge Albert Todd, who, it will be remembered, introduced\r\nCaptain Glazier to his audience at St. Louis upon the occasion of his\r\nlecture on the \"Pioneers of the Mississippi,\" and the presentation of\r\nthe \"Itasca\" to the Missouri Historical Society. Judge Todd is one of\r\nthe oldest and most reputed citizens of St. Louis, and showed an\r\nespecial appreciation of the Captain's endeavors to increase the\r\ngeographical lore of the Mississippi River:\r\n\r\n\r\n     To Captain Willard Glazier--Greeting:\r\n\r\n    With triple wreaths doth Fame thine head now crown;\r\n    The patriot-Soldier's, in fierce battles won;\r\n    The \"Pen's,\" than the \"Sword's,\" mankind's greater boon,\r\n    The bold Explorer's finding where was born\r\n    The rivers' King, till now, like Nile's, unknown.\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n    May years of high emprise increase thy fame,\r\n    And with thy death arise a deathless name.\r\n\r\n                                                  Albert Todd,\r\n                            Vice-President Missouri Historical Society.\r\n     St. Louis, _January_ 14, 1882.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe career of Captain Glazier up to the present time affords much food\r\nfor thought and speculation. His life is pre-eminently a life of\r\nsuccess, and is a brilliant example of what can be accomplished by the\r\naid of an indomitable will and untiring energy. Although his early\r\nadvantages of education and position were of a most ordinary\r\ndescription, nothing he has ever attempted failed, and none of his\r\nsuccesses have been mediocre. As a soldier he rose from a private to the\r\nrank of captain, and was known as one of the bravest officers on the\r\nfield--one of the best disciplinarians in camp; as an author his works\r\nare found in nearly every home in the land, and are read with interest\r\nby people of all ages, classes, and conditions of life; as a lecturer,\r\nthe press has ever spoken of him in the kindliest and most favorable\r\nterms; as an equestrian traveler he accomplished a feat never before\r\nattempted, and probably knows more about the wide stretch of country\r\nthrough which he passed than any other man living; as a navigator and\r\nexplorer he not only discovered what had baffled the most determined of\r\nall previous explorers, the source of the Mississippi River, but also\r\n\"paddled his own canoe\" down the entire course from its fountain-head to\r\nthe Gulf of Mexico. He has then unquestionably succeeded in all that he\r\nhas undertaken; and, as all men aim at success, the query naturally\r\narises, why is it that Willard Glazier occupies so high a position in\r\neach of his many fields of labor? The answer in all probability lies in\r\nthe fact that while _many_ men have ambition, _few_ have the untiring\r\nindustry, the calm perseverance, the determined will, and unfaltering\r\nfaith in themselves to grasp and hold the objects of that ambition.\r\nCaptain Glazier has never known what failure means, and recalling the\r\nevents of his life as portrayed in this narrative, now drawing to a\r\nclose, we can understand why this is true. Unceasing labor seems to have\r\nbeen his motto. As soon as he had pursued one path of industry or\r\nresearch until it could lead him no further, he sought out and traversed\r\nanother with unexampled patience and unflagging zeal. What wonder in the\r\nlight of such energy that unqualified success has crowned his\r\nwell-directed efforts!\r\n\r\nHis career affords an example which all men would do well to reflect\r\nupon and imitate. May the Youth of America, by the contemplation of a\r\nlife still comparatively young and yet so fraught with mighty deeds, be\r\nespecially inspired with the ambition to follow in his footsteps, and a\r\nwill to \"carve with many a sharp incision,\" from the shapeless block\r\nwhich lies before each, the rounded outlines of a strong and noble\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"SWORD AND PEN\" COMMENDATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACTS FROM NOTICES OF THE PRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Syracuse Times._\r\n\r\n\"Sword and Pen; or, Ventures and Adventures of Willard Glazier,\" is\r\nwritten in a very entertaining style. It gives interesting sketches of\r\nCaptain Glazier from boyhood down, and many amusing incidents are\r\nrelated, in which is embraced a period covering the lively war times.\r\nNear the end of the work is given a minute description of Captain\r\nGlazier's discovery of the source of the Mississippi River, in 1881; in\r\nwhich, of course, Lake Itasca loses its claim. The captain, after many\r\nadventures, reached the true head of the Great River, which lies many\r\nmiles back and beyond Lake Itasca, and from thence he made a voyage down\r\nthe \"Father of Waters\" in a birch canoe, to the Gulf of Mexico. The book\r\nis written by John Algernon Owens, contains 516 pages printed in\r\nattractive style, adorned with numerous fine wood cuts, and is generally\r\nattractive; in fact, people who have read \"Battles for the Union\" and\r\n\"Heroes of Three Wars\" with so much interest will be equally interested\r\nin the adventurous life of the soldier-author.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Chicago Tribune._\r\n\r\n\"Sword and Pen\" comprises incidents and reminiscences in the life of\r\nCaptain Willard Glazier, and in addition to his army experience gives\r\ndetails of a novel and adventurous feat accomplished in 1876. In that\r\nyear he rode on horseback across the Continent from Boston to San\r\nFrancisco. Over 200 days were occupied in making the trip, and the\r\ndistance traveled was more than 4,000 miles. His object in undertaking\r\nthis journey was to study at comparative leisure the section of country\r\nthrough which he would pass, and note the habits of the people he came\r\nin contact with. During this trip he was captured by the Indians after a\r\nsevere fight, and one of the herders comprising the party was burned at\r\nthe stake. In 1881, Captain Glazier started on an expedition to discover\r\nthe source of the Mississippi River. In this he was successful, and\r\nimmediately thereafter commenced the descent of the river, passing its\r\nentire length from the source to the Gulf of Mexico, in a small open\r\ncanoe. The new book entitled \"Sword and Pen\" gives a minute and graphic\r\ndescription of the overland ride and the trip down the Mississippi, as\r\nwell as the early army experience of the well-known soldier and author.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Hamilton_ (_Ont._) _Times._\r\n\r\n\"Sword and Pen\" is a work replete with stirring pen-pictures of events\r\nin the history of the United States during a critical period of its\r\nhistory. Its description of the principal incidents in the late war, and\r\nthe suffering of the author and others in that detestable \"Black Hole of\r\nCalcutta\"--the Libby Prison--are most graphic. Willard Glazier's life\r\nwas not confined to warfare, though he saw service in nearly all the\r\ngreat battles between the North and South. A few years ago he rode on\r\nhorseback from ocean to ocean, and his observations on that\r\nextraordinary trip are also included in this handsome and interesting\r\nvolume. He discovered the true source of the Mississippi in northern\r\nMinnesota, and afterwards performed the journey of 3,000 miles to the\r\nsea board in an open canoe, and a very interesting account of these\r\njourneyings is given in the concluding chapters of the work which is\r\nthroughout beautifully illustrated.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Troy Daily Times._\r\n\r\nThe Works of Captain Willard Glazier, the soldier-author, are so well\r\nknown and popular that a life of the writer cannot fail to be\r\ninteresting to a large portion of the public. A very complete and\r\nexcellent account of Glazier and his achievements has been prepared by\r\nJohn Algernon Owens, and published by P. W. Ziegler & Co., Philadelphia.\r\nThe book bears the title of \"Sword and Pen,\" and recounts the ventures\r\nand adventures of the subject of it in war and literature, comprising\r\nincidents and reminiscences of his childhood, his checkered life as a\r\nstudent and teacher, and his remarkable career as a soldier and author;\r\nembracing also the story of his unprecedented journey from ocean to\r\nocean on horseback, and an account of his discovery of the source of the\r\nMississippi river, and his canoe voyage from thence to the Gulf of\r\nMexico. The story is told in the simple, direct way that appeals at once\r\nto one's favorable attention. It is an exciting, in some portions a\r\nthrilling narrative, recounting some of the most dramatic and tragic\r\nscenes of the war, in which Glazier, as a youthful cavalry officer, bore\r\na brave and manly part, being then but nineteen years old. The lad\r\nabandoned his studies and his school teaching and went from Troy to\r\nbecome a member of the Harris light cavalry, with which he served during\r\nmany a bloody fray. He was captured by the rebels and shared the hard\r\nfate that fell to many a poor Union soldier in the prison pens of the\r\nSouth, and the recital of this part of his experience will recall the\r\nangry blood to the face of every old soldier who reads it, and arouse\r\nthe sentient sympathies of every patriot who peruses the volume. The\r\nbook contains an appreciative yet discriminating criticism of Glazier's\r\nliterary achievements, and is in every sense worthy of the hero with\r\nwhom it deals. It is profusely illustrated with battle and other scenes,\r\nand is accompanied by a map giving an accurate presentation of the route\r\npursued by Captain Glazier in his trip to the source of the Mississippi.\r\nAltogether this is a book well worth reading.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _Scranton Republican._\r\n\r\n\"Sword and Pen\" by John Algernon Owens, a story of endurance, patient\r\ntoil, danger and daring, very entertaining, as well as instructive. In\r\nMr. Owens Captain Glazier has found a biographer who has done him\r\njustice, and who has made a book that will be widely read.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Oswego Times and Express._\r\n\r\nWe have before us a new book, entitled \"Sword and Pen; or, Ventures and\r\nAdventures in War and Literature.\" It is a biography of the\r\nsoldier-author, Willard Glazier, a type of the adventurous American of\r\nwhich we may justly be proud. It takes up the boyish life of Willard\r\nGlazier, takes him from the school-room as a pupil to the school-room as\r\na teacher, until the war of the Rebellion called him to the army. It\r\ndetails his adventures as a member of the Ira Harris Cavalry until his\r\ncapture by the rebels, and the life he led in the prisons of the South;\r\nand is detailed in a graphic manner. When the war was over the same\r\nspirit of adventure which sent him to the front in the army drove him\r\ninto other adventures. The horseback ride from ocean to ocean is\r\ndescribed in an interesting style, followed by the search for the true\r\nsource of the Mississippi River and its successful termination, together\r\nwith an account of his canoe voyage to the Gulf of Mexico. The book is\r\nfull of action, and is interesting as giving a correct history of the\r\nlife of this remarkable man. It is profusely illustrated, and is\r\naccompanied by a map of the section covered by the source of the\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Boston Transcript._\r\n\r\nThe biography of Willard Glazier, under the title of \"Sword and Pen,\"\r\nhas achieved a large sale in the Eastern, Western and Middle States.\r\nThe subject of the biography, who is still living, was a bright,\r\nwide-awake lad, whose childhood was not more eventful than that of\r\nhundreds of other boys of like condition. He was ambitious, energetic,\r\nand wholly free from any bad habit which would operate as a drawback\r\nupon his advancement in life. His parents were not able to do more for\r\nhim in the way of an education than to send him to a common district\r\nschool, but he thirsted for an education, and his mind was continually\r\nbusy devising ways and means to secure it. The much-needed money to pay\r\nhis expenses at the Albany Normal School was at last gained by trapping\r\nminks, whose skins were worth from two to four dollars. From the Normal\r\nhe went to teach school, and was engaged in this profession when the\r\ncivil war broke out. He was then nineteen years old. The first shot\r\nfired at Sumter changed his whole life plans, and the summer of 1861\r\nfound him in the field as sergeant in the Second New York Cavalry. He\r\nparticipated in a good many exciting contests, and was finally wounded\r\nand captured at Brandy Station, in October, 1863. The story of his life\r\nin prison is vividly told. He made his escape after fourteen months'\r\nimprisonment, and made his way through the enemy's lines into Sherman's\r\narmy. After the war he wrote a volume made up of his war experiences,\r\nentitled \"Capture, Prison Pen, and Escape,\" over 400,000 copies of which\r\nhave been sold. In 1876, Captain Glazier started from the Revere House,\r\nin this city, to cross the Continent on horseback, a feat which he\r\nsuccessfully performed, reaching San Francisco in two hundred days from\r\nthe time of starting--a distance of 4,133 miles. In 1881, he made a\r\ncanoe voyage down the Mississippi of 3,000 miles. Captain Glazier is the\r\nauthor of several books, and has won considerable reputation as a\r\nlecturer. The book before us will be read with deep interest, not only\r\nfor what it is worth historically, but as showing what can be\r\naccomplished by pluck and brains without the backing of money.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _Buffalo News._\r\n\r\nThe readers of Captain Willard Glazier's works will be pleased with the\r\nbiography of this remarkable man, published by P. W. Ziegler & Co., of\r\nPhiladelphia. Captain Glazier's life is full of exciting interest, and\r\nthe well-written biography holds the reader's attention to the last. The\r\naccount of the discovery of the true source of the Mississippi is\r\nespecially interesting from the fact that it gives the best account of\r\nthat memorable event that has ever been published.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _Albany Sunday Press._\r\n\r\n\"Sword and Pen.\" This work is the biography of a man already well-known\r\nby the American public as a soldier and an author. The subject is an\r\nespecially interesting one to the people of this section, as Captain\r\nGlazier was born in St. Lawrence county of this State, and spent some\r\nyears of his life in this city. His works have been read with interest\r\nby thousands, and now those who have enjoyed them will have the\r\nopportunity to learn something of the author who has for so long\r\ndelighted them. This biography gives a very full and interesting account\r\nof the principal events in Captain Glazier's life, among which we notice\r\nespecially his remarkable journey from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean\r\non horseback, his discovery of the true source of the Mississippi River,\r\nand his canoe voyage thence to the Gulf of Mexico. All these episodes\r\nare profusely and elegantly illustrated.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Newark Register._\r\n\r\n\"Sword and Pen\" is the suggestive title of a very readable and\r\ninteresting biography of Captain Willard Glazier, the soldier-author, by\r\nJohn Algernon Owens. \"Biography,\" the author tells us in his preface,\r\n\"to be interesting, must be a transcript of an eventful as well as a\r\nremarkable career; and to be instructive, its subject should be\r\nexemplary in his aims and in his mode of attaining them.\" The subject of\r\nthis biography certainly fulfills these requirements, and a much bolder\r\nand less graceful narrative of his adventures and exploits would,\r\nwithout doubt, be interesting and instructive. Mr. Owens has, however,\r\nheightened the interest, and pointed the moral of his subject's\r\nremarkable career by his clear and correct style, and lively and\r\npicturesque narrative. Captain Glazier was born in northern New York,\r\nnear the St. Lawrence, in 1841. His boyhood was passed in the country,\r\nand filled with all a rustic lad's delights and exploits as well as\r\ndisadvantages and privations. Fighting hard for an education, he became\r\na teacher, continuing in this peaceful vocation until the outbreak of\r\nthe rebellion summoned him to his country's defence. Passing through a\r\nsuccession of the most remarkable adventures and escapes in the war, and\r\nrising from the ranks to a captain's post, Captain Glazier has, since\r\nthe war, become widely known as the soldier-author, and the triumphs of\r\nhis pen have been fully as great as, if not greater than, those of his\r\nsword. The work is well printed and handsomely bound, and will prove\r\nvery popular.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _Boston Globe._\r\n\r\nThe adventures of Willard Glazier admirably narrated by John Algernon\r\nOwens, under the title of \"Sword and Pen,\" is a fascinating biography in\r\nwhich the author has woven many pleasing incidents, sometimes quite out\r\nof the line of his story, yet always to the point and always\r\nentertaining. The war adventures of Glazier, who is called the\r\n\"Soldier-author,\" have already been largely read and appreciated,\r\nparticularly by old soldiers. Willard Glazier has enjoyed quite a\r\nliterary renown, the sale of his first book, \"Capture, Prison-Pen, and\r\nEscape,\" having been over 400,000 volumes. Mr. Owens has now given us\r\nCaptain Glazier's life in a neatly bound volume, from the press of P. W.\r\nZiegler & Co. of Philadelphia. The hero of this story had an eventful\r\ncareer which made it interesting. Born of parents of small means, but of\r\nthe old Puritan stock, and excellent character, and bred and nurtured in\r\nthe midst of the wildest and grandest scenery in the rugged county of\r\nSt. Lawrence, with no opportunities for culture, except such as he made\r\nfor himself, he rose by his ambition, and was the builder of his own\r\nfortune. There is a strong lesson pointed out by the graphic history of\r\nhis career. It teaches to the young uncompromising duty in every\r\nrelation of life--self-denial and pluck.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _Newark Daily Journal._\r\n\r\n\"Sword and Pen; or, the Ventures and Adventures of Willard Glazier.\"\r\nWillard Glazier is an author who has risen into popularity almost\r\nunprecedented in this country. It is said that his first book, \"Capture,\r\nPrison-Pen, and Escape,\" written from facts noted in his diary after a\r\nwonderful career on the battle-field, and in prisons of the South,\r\nreached the enormous sale of 400,000 volumes. \"Sword and Pen\" is the\r\nstory of Captain Glazier's life. Born in obscurity, and toiling for an\r\neducation with great perseverance and against obstacles that seemed\r\nalmost unsurmountable, he became a teacher of the first rank when only\r\neighteen years of age. Enlisting in the Second New York Cavalry, at the\r\nvery beginning of the war, he served gallantly under General Kilpatrick\r\nin all the battles of Virginia up to October 19, when he was taken\r\nprisoner at New Baltimore, after having two horses shot under him. He\r\nparticipated in digging the tunnel out of Libby Prison, through which\r\none hundred and fifteen Union prisoners escaped. Glazier, however, was\r\nleft behind. From Richmond he was sent to Danville and other prisons,\r\nfrequently attempting to escape. He was sent to Charleston jail, where,\r\nwith other prisoners, he was placed under fire of the Union guns on\r\nMorris Island. Next he was sent to Columbia, and then comes a thrilling\r\nrecital of escapes and recaptures; wading through swamps and across\r\nrivers at night, and lying hidden in thickets or negro huts by day;\r\ntracked by blood-hounds, frequently shot at; enduring the pangs of\r\nstarvation, thirst, cold and rain, the hero finally reached Sherman's\r\nlines after encountering a hundred deadly perils. The brave boy was a\r\nprisoner when the term of his enlistment expired, but he immediately\r\napplied for and obtained a new commission, and after a brief visit to\r\nhis parents, he re-entered the army and served until the end of the war.\r\nThe story is thrillingly told, yet between the many tragic events\r\ndepicted, there occur frequent humorous episodes, especially those\r\ndelineating negro character. Young Glazier's brilliant career as the\r\nwriter of \"Soldiers of the Saddle,\" \"Capture, Prison-Pen, and Escape,\"\r\n\"Battles for the Union,\" \"Heroes of Three Wars,\" \"Peculiarities of\r\nAmerican Cities,\" etc., is fully given, with copious extracts from each\r\nwork, together with highly favorable notices from the _Boston Post_,\r\n_New York Tribune_, _Chicago Inter-Ocean_ and other leading newspapers.\r\nThe last part of the book is devoted to a voluminous and somewhat\r\nroseate description of Captain Glazier's highly successful lecture tour\r\non horseback from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean; his discovery of\r\nthe source of the Mississippi River, and his canoe voyage from thence to\r\nthe Gulf of Mexico. Captain Glazier is unquestionably a hero, possessing\r\ngenius of a high order, and as he is now only forty-two years of age, it\r\nwould seem that there are still brilliant achievements before him.\r\nWhatever may be said of the literary merits of his biography, the\r\nhistory is of absorbing interest. It is such that takes hold of the\r\npopular heart, and the hundreds of thousands of Grand Army men who read\r\nit will seem to \"fight their battles o'er again.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _New York Herald._\r\n\r\n\"Sword and Pen; or, Ventures and Adventures of Willard Glazier,\" by John\r\nAlgernon Owens, is a well-written book and altogether readable. It\r\ndescribes the humble origin of one who afterwards became one of the most\r\ndashing officers in the Federal cavalry service during the war for the\r\nUnion. It tells of the vicissitudes of a life restless but resolute, and\r\nwhich bears the stamp of heroism and success. There are stories of\r\nschool-days full of the activity and frivolity of youth, of failure and\r\nfortune, and a graphic sketch of the turning point in Glazier's career,\r\nwhich came with the rebellion. From the day he entered the ranks of the\r\nHarris Light Cavalry his course was steadily onward and upward, rising\r\nfrom corporal to be the captain of brave men nerved to the utmost\r\nendurance and inured to the dangers and hardships of war. The ensuing\r\npages ring with the enthusiasm of martial achievements, of peril by day\r\nand night, of capture, of the dungeon, and the thrilling escape. The\r\nbook closes with a vivid account of his famous ride on horseback from\r\nocean to ocean, from Boston to San Francisco. This unparalleled ride was\r\naccomplished by Captain Glazier in 1876, the Centennial year, and serves\r\nas a fitting conclusion to a career marked by indomitable industry, true\r\ncourage and unquestioned success, showing that\r\n\r\n    \"Honor and shame from no condition rise;\r\n    Act well your part, there all the honor lies.\"\r\n\r\nThe book is profusely illustrated and will be an interesting addition to\r\neither a public or private library.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Hartford Courant._\r\n\r\n\"Sword and Pen; or, Ventures and Adventures of Willard Glazier,\" the\r\nsoldier-author, by John Algernon Owens. Captain Glazier has had a very\r\nlively career both during the war and since, in explorations on the\r\nupper Mississippi. He is the author of a long list of war books himself,\r\nwhich have been much commended by the press, for their thrilling\r\nnarrative style, patriotic enthusiasm, and dash. He is evidently of the\r\nstuff of which American heroes are made. The book claims for him high\r\nrank as an explorer and discoverer in being the first to definitely\r\nlocate the True Source of the Mississippi. It is a readable story of an\r\nadventurous life, and being fully illustrated, commends itself to all\r\nclasses of readers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _Cincinnati Commercial Gazette._\r\n\r\nJohn Algernon Owens has compiled incidents and reminiscences in the life\r\nof Willard Glazier, the soldier-author, and the work should occupy a\r\nposition on the shelf of every library. The writings of Captain Glazier\r\nare too well known to need any words of commendation from us, his\r\n\"Capture, Prison-Pen, and Escape,\" issued soon after the close of the\r\nwar, having been among the most extensively read annals of the war. The\r\n\"Sword and Pen\" gives a sketch of the early life and adventures of the\r\nsoldier-author, his school-boy days, and the incidents of that halcyon\r\nperiod of youth, all of which reads like a romance. His academic life is\r\nthen detailed, after which the stern realities of life are encountered.\r\nHis military life follows, and his capture by the Confederate troops.\r\nThen follows a recital of the dreary and monotonous routine of prison\r\nlife, together with a vivid account of the scenes enumerated, the\r\nescape, and the final entry into the Federal lines. His life after\r\nre-entering the cavalry is given, and finally his career as an author\r\nand travels across the Continent. The work is written in an attractive\r\nstyle with a recital of much that has never been told before, while the\r\nold is so garnished that it cannot fail to interest all classes of\r\nreaders.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Wilmington Morning News._\r\n\r\n\"Sword and Pen\" is the life of Willard Glazier, who was born in St.\r\nLawrence county, New York, in 1841, of parents of narrow means, who was\r\na bright, mischievous boy, who educated himself by his own efforts, and\r\nbecame a country school-teacher; who enlisted in the Harris Light\r\nCavalry (a New York regiment), at the beginning of the war; who was\r\npromoted from the ranks on account of soldierly qualities and personal\r\nbravery, to the office of first lieutenant; who was captured by the\r\nrebels and imprisoned in Libby Prison and other rebel pens; who finally\r\nescaped and made his way on foot under great privations to General\r\nSherman's lines during that commander's \"march to the sea;\" who had made\r\nfull notes of his varied army experience, and from these had written\r\nseveral very popular books about military life at that time, and who,\r\nhence, is designated, \"The Soldier-Author,\" and appears to be enjoying\r\nall the quiet rewards of a patient, industrious, and resolute effort to\r\nimprove himself and his fortunes in every legitimate and proper way. As\r\nan account of a boy of the people it is clear and instructive; as a\r\npicture of patriotic and courageous military service at a time of public\r\nperil, it is graphic and often thrilling; as a picture of a determined\r\nand honorable effort by a young man of generous instincts, to make his\r\nown way in the world, it is wholesome and useful. Its style will\r\nprobably make its obvious lessons the more impressive to the mass of\r\nreaders; and its general circulation among the young men of this\r\ncountry, nine-tenths of whom must make their own fortunes if they are to\r\nhave any, will be a public benefit. It teaches honesty, self-help and\r\npatriotism; and we cannot have too many teachers at work upon these\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _New York Tribune._\r\n\r\nThe history of a famous man can never fail to interest the reading\r\npublic, especially when it records such adventures and dangers as those\r\nthrough which the hero of the \"Sword and Pen\" passed. Willard Glazier's\r\nconnection with the great civil war is a fact rendering unusually\r\nfascinating his biography, as perhaps no other fact could have done.\r\nThe battles in which he fought are those around which centre the deepest\r\ninterest, and the vivid descriptions of his life in Libby Prison, his\r\nunsuccessful attempt at escape therefrom, and his later imprisonment at\r\nCamp Oglethorpe, are replete with interest to both old and young. The\r\nbook is written in a bright, attractive style, and is well illustrated\r\nwith many cuts of true war life and its thrilling incidents. For the\r\nold, and especially the young, it is a book calculated to work much\r\ngood, teaching lessons of patriotism, self-reliance, and perseverance.\r\nHis life was one of unusual events, and his indomitable ambition to\r\nadvance was not the least of his many excellent qualities. Like many\r\nother well-known men, he began life in humble circumstances, and only to\r\nhis own efforts was due the great success he achieved. The author, John\r\nAlgernon Owens, brings out vividly the strong points of his hero's\r\ncharacter, and throws around the whole narrative a halo of bright fancy,\r\nwhich renders the book as attractive as the most highly wrought romance.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _Baltimore American._\r\n\r\n\"Sword and Pen.\" Willard Glazier has made himself prominent both in war\r\nand literature. He cast his lot with the Federal cause, and served for a\r\ntime as a private soldier in the Second Regiment, New York Cavalry. A\r\nlittle later he won laurels at the battles of Cedar Mountain, Manassas,\r\nFredericksburg, Gettysburg, Brandy Station, and other historic spots,\r\nand rose rapidly in rank, until at the sharp skirmish near Buckland\r\nMills he led his comrades as their captain, and was himself captured.\r\nAll these features in the career of the soldier-author are portrayed in\r\nthe most interesting style, and are followed by a graphic description of\r\nlife in Libby Prison. Mr. Owens winds together the thread of detail in\r\nthe ventures and adventures of his hero, so that the book reads more\r\nlike a romance than a veritable history. The book is divided into three\r\nparts, which are so closely interwoven that the whole forms one\r\ncontinuous story of a very adventurous life. The hero escapes from\r\nLibby, but is recaptured and confined at Camp Oglethorpe, in Georgia. He\r\nalso escapes from this prison, and with the assistance of negroes,\r\nfinally reaches the Federal lines. In 1876, he crossed the Continent on\r\nhorseback, and was captured by hostile Indians. He escapes and\r\nsubsequently planned the way for an expedition to the source of the\r\nMississippi River.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _Philadelphia Ledger._\r\n\r\n\"Sword and Pen\" by John Algernon Owens. Captain Glazier, the\r\nsoldier-author, is the writer of several popular works about the\r\nwar--\"Soldiers of the Saddle,\" \"Battles for the Union,\" etc. Though\r\nstill a young man he has had a most eventful life, serving throughout\r\nthe war, and passing through many adventures of which he has since made\r\ngood use in his life as an author. He has also accomplished the\r\nremarkable feat of riding from Boston to San Francisco on horseback.\r\nThis memoir tells the story of his life in attractive narrative form,\r\nand is full of interesting tales of the war.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Philadelphia Evening Star._\r\n\r\nCaptain Willard Glazier, who is well known as the author of several\r\npopular works about the late war, some of which have had an\r\nextraordinary sale, has himself been made the subject of a book by Mr.\r\nJohn Algernon Owens. Captain Glazier has had an eventful life; has been\r\na teacher, a soldier, an author, explorer and a horseback tourist; and\r\nthere is much in his career inculcating the value of self-reliance and\r\nother sterling qualities. He has found an appreciative biographer in Mr.\r\nOwens, whose work will more especially interest soldiers and those fond\r\nof reading of adventure.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _Philadelphia Evening Bulletin._\r\n\r\n\"Sword and Pen\" is a book describing the ventures and adventures of\r\nCaptain Willard Glazier, who was one of the many gallant heroes of the\r\ncivil war, and who wrote some clever books about it after he had laid\r\naside the sword for the pen. The author of the present work is John\r\nAlgernon Owens, and the account he gives of Glazier's youth and young\r\nmanhood, his experiences in battle, in prison, after peace came, in\r\ndomestic life and in literature, is full of interest, entertainment and\r\ninstruction. We heartily commend it to our readers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _Philadelphia Inquirer._\r\n\r\nOf course all Americans remember Captain Willard Glazier, the well-known\r\nsoldier-author, who has made himself prominent in war and in literature.\r\nThe present volume is a more than usually interesting one, and is most\r\ncarefully and effectively gotten up. It relates graphically the ventures\r\nand adventures of Glazier from his youth to the present time; and many\r\nof the adventures through which he passed are so thrilling as to seem\r\nalmost impossible, yet facts prove them true. Glazier's youth is\r\nminutely detailed; we are treated to a series of adventures by the\r\nyoungster, which induce us to believe that his bump of reverence for his\r\nteachers and elders was represented by a cavity. But passing through the\r\nincidents that precede the age of manhood, he turned up in the Second\r\nRegiment, New York Cavalry. From that time until the close of the war,\r\nGlazier's career was a stirring one. From the early fight at Flipper's\r\nOrchard, he successively took part in the battles of Cedar Mountain,\r\nManassas, Fredericksburg, Brandy Station, Gettysburg and other\r\nengagements. At the cavalry engagement of New Baltimore he was taken\r\nprisoner, and soon thereafter made the acquaintance of the inside of\r\nLibby Prison. We get many glimpses of life in that well-known\r\nPrison-Pen, and are treated to numerous pathetic and humorous incidents\r\nthat fell under Glazier's notice. All have read of what was endured by\r\nsuch of the Union soldiers who passed that ordeal, and the reader can,\r\ntherefore, imagine what fell to the lot of this dashing cavalryman. The\r\ngreat tunnel attempt at escape is graphically told. Glazier also got a\r\ntaste of prison fare at Camp Oglethorpe in Georgia. But he made his\r\nescape, and fed and sheltered by negroes, at last, after a second\r\ncapture, reached the Federal lines. Soon after the war he wrote a book,\r\ncalled \"Capture, Prison-Pen and Escape;\" later he wrote another volume,\r\ncalled \"Three Years in the Federal Cavalry.\" After this came \"Battles\r\nfor the Union,\" speedily to be followed by \"Heroes of Three Wars.\" After\r\nthis he rode across the Continent on horseback, and then took the\r\nlecture field, and indeed he has proved himself a thorough American in\r\nbeing able to do anything and everything equally well. Being possessed\r\nof an energy and audacity that were perfectly marvelous, he rushed in,\r\nas Shakespeare observes, \"where angels feared to tread.\" It is a miracle\r\nthat he ever lived to relate them, for Libby Prison experience alone was\r\nsufficient to destroy the constitution of the majority of the prisoners.\r\n\"Sword and Pen\" will have a large sale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 APPENDIX\r\n\r\n                                  BY THE\r\n\r\n                               PUBLISHERS OF\r\n\r\n                          \"DOWN THE GREAT RIVER.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDENDUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following Appendix to \"Down the Great River,\" by Captain Willard\r\nGlazier, is here reproduced in verification of his claim to the\r\ndiscovery of the TRUE SOURCE of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\n                                        P.

In view of\r\nthe apparent incredulity of some critics, it is thought expedient to lay\r\nthis matter before the public in connection with Captain Glazier's\r\nlatest work, \"Down the Great River,\" which gives a detailed account of\r\nhis discovery, in order that a sound and enlightened conclusion may be\r\narrived at upon the merits of the claim presented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. LETTERS FROM BARRETT CHANNING PAINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe commence with the press correspondence of Mr. Barrett Channing Paine,\r\nwho, at the period of the Glazier expedition, was a reporter on the\r\nstaff of the Saint Paul _Pioneer Press_, and subsequently Managing\r\nEditor of the Saint Paul _Globe_. This gentleman accompanied Captain\r\nGlazier to the source of the Mississippi, and thence down the river in a\r\ncanoe to the Gulf of Mexico. During the entire voyage Mr. Paine was in\r\nconstant correspondence with the _Pioneer Press_ and leading papers of\r\nvarious cities on the banks of the Mississippi, to which he furnished\r\ndetailed accounts of the discovery and incidents of the journey. We\r\npresent only a few of these letters, selected from a large number, for\r\nthe perusal of the reader. The writer was certainly in a position to\r\nknow the truth of the matters upon which he so intelligently reports.\r\n\r\n_Letter to the Brainerd (Minnesota) Tribune from Channing Paine:_\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                \"Schoolcraft Island,\r\n                                            \"_Lake Itasca, Minnesota,_\r\n                                                 \"July 22, 1881.\r\n\r\n     \"_To the Editor of the Tribune:_\r\n\r\n     \"Captain Glazier's party arrived at this much-talked-of lake last\r\n     evening, reaching the south-eastern arm by a three mile portage,\r\n     and then paddling down to the Island, where we encamped. We left\r\n     Leech Lake on the sixteenth, after cordial farewells with the\r\n     gentlemen then at the Agency, especially Mr. Nichols and Rev. Edwin\r\n     Benedict, to whose kindness we were greatly indebted. Launching our\r\n     little fleet of canoes, three in number, on the billowy surface of\r\n     the lake, we started for our first objective, Lake Itasca. After\r\n     leaving Leech Lake our way lay up a river called by the Indians\r\n     Gabakauazeba. The river broadens out a short distance from the\r\n     lake, but narrows again and becomes tortuous and full of snags.\r\n     Passing safely through all these, we reached, late in the\r\n     afternoon, a fine lake nearly ten miles long, upon the shore of\r\n     which we encamped. Next morning we paddled to the upper end of the\r\n     lake, and were there introduced to our first real portage. Two\r\n     miles and a half over a very rough country--the hardest work we\r\n     ever undertook--brought us to another but smaller lake, and then,\r\n     for five days, lakes and portages followed each other in rapid\r\n     succession, until at length the waters of Itasca burst upon our\r\n     view. The talk of our guides, coupled with what we had heard at\r\n     Leech Lake, had led Captain Glazier to the conclusion that,\r\n     whatever the source of the Mississippi might be, there was\r\n     reasonable ground for the belief that Lake Itasca was not. Chief\r\n     among the theories advanced by the Indian guides, one of whom,\r\n     Chenowagesic, had hunted and trapped for years at the headwaters of\r\n     this river, was that there existed a lake of good dimensions and\r\n     wooded shores _above_ Itasca, which poured its waters into the\r\n     so-called source, and which was itself really the source of the\r\n     Great River. They also stated (correctly, as we afterwards learned)\r\n     that the stream which flowed from the lake spoken of by Paul\r\n     Beaulieu as perhaps the source, contributed much less water to the\r\n     main stream at its confluence with it than did the stream from\r\n     Itasca. Resolved to explore the lake _above_ Itasca, the captain\r\n     started with two canoes, next morning, from Schoolcraft Island, and\r\n     pushed up to the head of the lake. Chenowagesic piloted us through\r\n     the rushes with which this end of Itasca is filled, and presently\r\n     we found ourselves in a small but rapid stream, up which we went,\r\n     and after following its windings, paddled again through some\r\n     rushes, and then shot out upon the smooth surface of a beautiful\r\n     lake. This lake is about two miles long by a mile and a half broad,\r\n     and its shape is that of a heart. The shores are beautifully\r\n     wooded, and its waters are deep and clear. On its one promontory\r\n     our party landed. After exploring its shores, and first slaking our\r\n     thirst at a spring of ice-cold water which bubbled up near by, we\r\n     were marshalled in line, and Captain Glazier made a few remarks\r\n     pertinent to the discovery of the _true source_ of the Father of\r\n     Waters. After this six volleys were fired in honor of the occasion,\r\n     and then the question of a name for the new lake arose. This being\r\n     left for the party to decide, I addressed my companions, and after\r\n     alluding to the time, money and energy expended by the leader of\r\n     the expedition, proposed that it be named LAKE GLAZIER in his\r\n     honor. This proposition was received with applause and carried by\r\n     acclamation, and it was further decided that the name and date\r\n     should be blazed on a pine tree which stood conspicuously on the\r\n     point. After this we re-embarked in our canoes and returned to the\r\n     Island.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the following letter Channing Paine gives a further account of the\r\ndiscovery of the head of the Great River:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     \"Douglas House,\r\n                                                  \"_Aitkin, Minnesota_,\r\n                                                  \"August 11, 1881.\r\n\r\n     \"_To the Editor--Saint Louis Globe-Democrat:_\r\n\r\n     \"Lake Itasca, for many years, has been regarded, both by\r\n     geographical societies and map-makers, as well as by the public\r\n     generally, as the source of the grandest of rivers--the mighty\r\n     Mississippi. But geographical knowledge, like all other knowledge,\r\n     is of little consequence if it is not progressive, and in its\r\n     history we have seen the firmly-rooted beliefs of centuries torn up\r\n     and tossed aside by the explorations and reasoning of intrepid\r\n     travellers, who, respecting truth and facts more than mere theory,\r\n     have accepted nothing without proof, merely because others have so\r\n     accepted it. This is the ground occupied by Captain Willard Glazier\r\n     in his explorations in search of the source of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\n     \"Starting for the headwaters of this great river in July last, he\r\n     learned that the dense forests which surround the source of the\r\n     Father of Waters were rarely penetrated by white men, or even by\r\n     Indians, at any time except in winter, when lakes and rivers were\r\n     frozen up, and the whole surface of the country covered with a\r\n     mantle of snow.\r\n\r\n     \"He also heard through the interpreter and Indian guides who\r\n     accompanied him that the aboriginal inhabitants of these primeval\r\n     forests did not regard Itasca as the source; but, while rejecting\r\n     it, differed among themselves as to what lake really was the\r\n     fountain-head. Some claimed that the stream from Itasca was not\r\n     itself the main stream, but flowed into the river proper some three\r\n     miles below the lake. The stream to which it was tributary, though\r\n     narrower, was, they claimed, deeper and swifter, bringing to the\r\n     united streams more water than the one from Lake Itasca.\r\n\r\n     \"Others considered the Itascan stream as the main one, but spoke of\r\n     another lake, broad and beautiful, which lay above Itasca and\r\n     poured its clear waters into the accepted source through a small\r\n     stream which entered the southern arm of Lake Itasca. Captain\r\n     Glazier determined to thoroughly examine all this region, and to\r\n     settle definitely and forever the true source of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\n     \"Acting in accordance with this resolution, he pushed on toward\r\n     Itasca, intending to make it a starting-point for further\r\n     exploration. Reaching this objective point after innumerable\r\n     hardships, he camped on Schoolcraft Island, and after a day of rest\r\n     directed operations toward the lakes and streams of the surrounding\r\n     country.\r\n\r\n     \"Thoroughly surveying the stream that the Indians claimed to be the\r\n     main one, he found it much inferior in volume to that from Itasca.\r\n     This point settled, he closely examined the shores of Lake Itasca\r\n     for tributary streams, finding but three of any importance. Of\r\n     these three the one by far the largest came in at the extreme head\r\n     of the lake, at a point where it is nearly filled with bulrushes.\r\n\r\n     \"Taking two canoes, Captain Glazier ascended this stream, which,\r\n     though shallow, is rapid, yet so narrow in places that to jump\r\n     across it would be an easy task. Following its windings, he entered\r\n     what appeared to be a lake filled with rushes. Pushing through\r\n     this barrier, however, the canoes soon glided out upon the still\r\n     surface of a beautiful lake, clear as crystal, with pebbly bottom,\r\n     and its shores covered with a thick growth of pine. This lake is\r\n     formed in the shape of a heart, having but one marked promontory.\r\n     Its greatest length is about two miles and its width a mile and a\r\n     half.\r\n\r\n     \"Captain Glazier found that this fine lake was fed by three\r\n     rivulets, which rose in swamps a few miles from the lake, and\r\n     thoroughly convinced that this body of water was the true source of\r\n     the Mississippi, he proclaimed it as such. Without waiting for\r\n     discussion, the members of the party decided unanimously to call it\r\n     Lake Glazier in his honor. Modestly expressing his thanks for this\r\n     mark of their appreciation, Captain Glazier said that, though he\r\n     firmly believed this lake to be the source of the river, he should\r\n     relax none of his vigilance on the trip through the unknown part of\r\n     the stream, but would carefully examine all water flowing into the\r\n     Mississippi, in order to be positive as to the main stream.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn reaching Hastings, Captain Glazier and his fellow-voyagers were\r\nhospitably entertained by some of the leading citizens and Mr. Paine\r\naddressed the following letter to the Editor of the _Hastings Gazette_:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    \"Foster House,\r\n                                                \"_Hastings, Minnesota_,\r\n                                                \"September 5, 1881.\r\n\r\n     \"_To the Editor of the Gazette:_\r\n\r\n     \"For many years the source of the Mississippi was as much a mystery\r\n     as is at present that of the Nile. But when in 1832 Schoolcraft\r\n     made his official exploration of the headwaters of this great\r\n     water-course, and after a long and arduous journey up the stream\r\n     reached a lake which he named Itasca, and pronounced it the head of\r\n     the river, the matter was considered settled, and speculation was\r\n     no longer rife in regard to this point. Now, however, it has been\r\n     proved by Captain Willard Glazier beyond doubt that the lake which\r\n     has so long enjoyed the honor of being the source of our greatest\r\n     river had an honor it did not merit.\r\n\r\n     \"Going thither with the object of visiting the head of the river,\r\n     Captain Glazier was led to suspect by the talk of his guides, one\r\n     of whom, Chenowagesic, had hunted and trapped for years in the\r\n     region around the source, that Lake Itasca had really no greater\r\n     claim to be considered the head of the river than Cass Lake, or\r\n     Bemidji or Winnibegoshish, all larger and finer lakes than Itasca.\r\n     Above and beyond Itasca lay another lake. This, with its feeding\r\n     springs, was the source of the mighty river, and this lake, if it\r\n     existed, Captain Glazier resolved to visit and explore. After a\r\n     long and severe journey he reached it, being the first white\r\n     traveller to float upon its surface; and after thoroughly examining\r\n     its feeders and the narrow stream through which it flowed into\r\n     Itasca, he felt that he had found the _true source_ of the\r\n     Mississippi. Nevertheless, he continued his explorations along the\r\n     river below Itasca after passing through that lake, and satisfied\r\n     himself thoroughly that the new lake was at the head of the main\r\n     stream. In speaking of the source of the Mississippi, therefore, we\r\n     should henceforth call it LAKE GLAZIER instead of Lake Itasca.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following description of Lake Glazier from the pen of Channing Paine\r\nappeared in the _Dubuque Herald_ of September sixth, 1881:\r\n\r\n\r\n                              LAKE GLAZIER.\r\n\r\n     \"The new-found source of the Mississippi is a sparkling little gem\r\n     of a lake, situated above and beyond Lake Itasca. It nestles among\r\n     the pines of an unfrequented and wild region of Northern Minnesota,\r\n     many miles from the nearest white settlement, and just on the\r\n     dividing ridge which forms the great watershed of North America.\r\n     Within a few miles of it can be found lakes and streams, whose\r\n     waters are tributary to the Red River of the North and the\r\n     Yellowstone, thus reaching the sea thousands of miles from the\r\n     mouth of the mighty Mississippi, which flows in a limpid brook from\r\n     LAKE GLAZIER. This lake, discovered to be the source of one of the\r\n     greatest rivers of the world, by Captain Willard Glazier, on the\r\n     Twenty-second of July, 1881, is about two miles in greatest\r\n     diameter, and would be nearly round in shape but for a single\r\n     promontory, whose rocky shores give it in outline the form of a\r\n     heart. The waters of the lake are exceedingly clear and pure,\r\n     coming from springs, some being at the bottom, but the three most\r\n     prominent rise a few miles back, in low, wet land enclosed by\r\n     sand-hills, and flow into the lake in little rills. On the very\r\n     point of the promontory is a spring whose waters are as cold as\r\n     ice, and at which the Glazier party slaked their thirst while\r\n     exploring the shores of the new lake. So lonely is the region\r\n     around the lake that for fourteen days not even a red-skin was\r\n     seen, and wearied by the hardships of this rough country, yet with\r\n     a feeling of having added something to geographical knowledge, the\r\n     Captain and his party were glad to return to civilization.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Saint Louis _Post-Dispatch_ published the following, with several\r\nother communications, from Mr. Paine:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 \"1310 Olive Street,\r\n\r\n                                              \"_Saint Louis, Missouri,_\r\n\r\n                                                \"October 10, 1881.\r\n\r\n     \"_To the Editor--Post-Dispatch:_\r\n\r\n     \"Lake Itasca has been considered to be the source of the\r\n     Mississippi for so many years that any man who disputes its title\r\n     to that honor is looked upon as a radical and one bent upon\r\n     upsetting all our preconceived geographical ideas. Still it is a\r\n     fact that Lake Itasca is _not_ the source, and has no greater claim\r\n     to being called so than has Cass Lake or Lake Bemidji or Lake\r\n     Pepin. This fact was discovered beyond all doubt by Captain Willard\r\n     Glazier, who equipped an expedition last July and started for the\r\n     headwaters of the Mississippi. Reaching Lake Itasca after a journey\r\n     of great hardship, he camped on Schoolcraft Island, and, using this\r\n     as a base of operations, he thoroughly explored the lakes and\r\n     rivers which contribute their waters to the infant Mississippi. The\r\n     various theories and stories heard from his Indian guides were\r\n     considered as clues and faithfully followed up until their truth or\r\n     falsity was ascertained. Success at length crowned his efforts, for\r\n     a beautiful lake was found above Itasca, and in the direct line of\r\n     the course of the river below Itasca, which lake proved to be the\r\n     farthest water--the extreme head of the Mississippi. The lake,\r\n     which the members of the expedition voted to call LAKE GLAZIER, in\r\n     honor of their leader, is about two miles in diameter, with clear\r\n     and beautiful water, fed by springs, and altogether one of the\r\n     prettiest lakes of its size in Minnesota. The stream which flows\r\n     from it into Itasca is quite rapid, though so narrow that in some\r\n     places one can easily jump across it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following account of an interview with Mr. Paine is extracted from\r\nthe New Orleans _Democrat_ of November twentieth, 1881:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"There arrived at the Jetties on the fifteenth a tiny cedar canoe,\r\n     bearing aloft at the bows a pennant with the inscription _Alice_,\r\n     and at the stern a United States flag. Its officers and crew\r\n     consisted of Captain Willard Glazier, a distinguished writer, and a\r\n     reportorial companion, Mr. Barrett Channing Paine, of the Saint\r\n     Paul _Pioneer Press_, who had come all the way down the\r\n     Mississippi, from its source, in this frail bark. Great, indeed,\r\n     was the joy of the voyagers as they glided down to the mouth of the\r\n     river, and saw the salt spray of the Gulf dash high over the\r\n     seaward wall of the Jetties. After clambering up by the beacon, and\r\n     standing gazing at the broad expanse of water, toward which they\r\n     had been paddling for the last four months, until they were\r\n     drenched by an unusually heavy wave, the two men again descended\r\n     slowly, scarcely conscious that their long voyage was finished.\r\n     Hailing a passing boat, they boarded her, and the light canoe was\r\n     made fast behind and towed back to Port Eads, where the travellers\r\n     were most hospitably entertained until the arrival of an inward\r\n     bound steamship to bring them to New Orleans.\r\n\r\n     \"As this is by far the longest canoe voyage ever made, and extended\r\n     the whole length of the Great River, some account of the\r\n     expedition, its aims and incidents, cannot fail to be of interest.\r\n\r\n     \"A representative of the _Democrat_ had the pleasure of meeting\r\n     Barrett Channing Paine, who accompanied Captain Glazier, and from\r\n     him learned the following particulars of the voyage:\r\n\r\n     \"Captain Willard Glazier is a serious, soldierly-looking man, and a\r\n     military author of repute. Among his best known works are 'Soldiers\r\n     of the Saddle,' 'Capture, Prison-Pen and Escape,' 'Battles for the\r\n     Union,' 'Heroes of Three Wars,' and 'Peculiarities of American\r\n     Cities.' The Captain does not look like a man of thoughtless,\r\n     adventurous disposition, and it seems strange at first that he\r\n     should have made the voyage in the manner he did; but it looks\r\n     sensible enough when his reasons are taken into consideration. The\r\n     Captain made the trip avowedly for the purpose of study and\r\n     observation, as he did his horseback ride across the continent,\r\n     from Boston to San Francisco, in 1876. He wished to thoroughly\r\n     understand the people of the great valley, their social conditions,\r\n     industries and modes of life. He also expected to obtain much\r\n     enjoyment from the changing scenery and climate. Had he travelled\r\n     by steamboat or railway, he would have been whisked through the\r\n     country in a week or so, and would have had absolutely no\r\n     opportunity for obtaining an inside view of the condition of\r\n     affairs. In addition to seeing the country, the Captain designed\r\n     delivering a lecture prepared specially for the purpose on the\r\n     'Pioneers of the Mississippi,' in all the important towns on his\r\n     route. The lecture treated chiefly of the early explorers--De Soto,\r\n     Marquette, La Salle, and Hennepin.\r\n\r\n     \"Actuated by these motives, he procured a fine cedar canoe of the\r\n     Rushton model, which he shipped to Aitkin, the most northerly point\r\n     on the river reached by rail. He then went forward, himself, to\r\n     Saint Paul, accompanied by his brother, where he was joined by his\r\n     present companion, and there made final preparations for the long\r\n     voyage.\r\n\r\n     \"At Brainerd the party left the line of the Northern Pacific\r\n     Railroad, and proceeded by wagon over a road, which was hardly more\r\n     than a trail, to Leech Lake, where the Government has an Indian\r\n     Agency. The country traversed was exceedingly wild, being almost\r\n     without inhabitants, and covered with a growth of jack-pines. It\r\n     being the blueberry season, quite a number of Indians were seen\r\n     picking that fruit, which grows there in abundance. As a rule the\r\n     braves lay in the shade, smoking or sleeping, while the squaws and\r\n     children did the picking. At night they found a stopping-place at\r\n     Pine River, and the following afternoon arrived at the Agency,\r\n     where there are two trading-posts and a number of white men.\r\n\r\n     \"Here three birch-bark canoes were purchased, and the services of\r\n     an equal number of Indian guides procured, one of whom also acted\r\n     in the capacity of interpreter. All of these were required to reach\r\n     the source of the river, which was a matter of great difficulty and\r\n     some danger. Lake Itasca, which was then supposed by most people to\r\n     be the source of the Mississippi, lay five days' journey away,\r\n     through an almost impassable wilderness. Indeed, it was well-nigh\r\n     impossible to find even an Indian who had visited it. But at last\r\n     one was found in the person of Chenowagesic, a Chippewa brave, who\r\n     consented to pilot the party to that lake.\r\n\r\n     \"On July seventeenth everything was in readiness, the three birch\r\n     canoes were launched on Leech Lake, and the voyage had fairly\r\n     commenced. After crossing Leech Lake the voyagers pushed up the\r\n     Gabecanazeba River, which was filled with rushes and wild rice.\r\n     Laboriously paddling through these, they reached another lake, and\r\n     encamped for the night. Next morning this lake was crossed, and the\r\n     first real hardship of the expedition confronted them in the shape\r\n     of a portage. The provisions and luggage were taken out of the\r\n     canoes and transported on the backs of the Indians across the\r\n     country, a distance of three miles, through underbrush so thick\r\n     that they could not see ten feet in advance. Five days were spent\r\n     in this manner--first paddling across a little lake, and then\r\n     making a long portage, until at last Lake Itasca was reached, and\r\n     the party encamped on Schoolcraft Island. By this time the Captain\r\n     felt convinced from the talk of the guides, particularly of\r\n     Chenowagesic, the chief guide, whose words were translated to him,\r\n     that Itasca was not the source of the Great River.\r\n\r\n     \"Determined to ascertain the truth, he proceeded at once to make a\r\n     thorough exploration of the headwaters of the river, guided in a\r\n     great measure by Chenowagesic, who had hunted and trapped for years\r\n     in this region. Various streams joining the infant Mississippi were\r\n     examined, and found to contain less water than that stream, thus\r\n     establishing the fact that Itasca is on the main stream. Then a\r\n     thorough exploration of the shores of the lake itself was made.\r\n     Several creeks were found to enter it, the chief of which came in\r\n     at the southern end of the south-western arm of the lake. Itasca,\r\n     at this point, is filled with bulrushes, through which, with great\r\n     difficulty, the explorers forced their way, but were rewarded by\r\n     finding themselves in a clear, swift-running stream, having an\r\n     average depth of about ten or twelve inches, and a width of about\r\n     five feet. Up this tortuous stream the canoes were pushed and\r\n     dragged, and finally the voyagers shot out upon the surface of a\r\n     beautiful heart-shaped lake, which proved, upon careful\r\n     exploration, to be the true source of the Father of Waters. After\r\n     examining the shores, the party landed on a rocky point, and\r\n     Captain Glazier made a short speech, expressing his confident\r\n     belief that they had found the true source of the Great River, and\r\n     added something to the geographical knowledge of the country. He\r\n     was followed by Mr. Paine, who, after a few introductory remarks,\r\n     moved that the new lake be called LAKE GLAZIER, in honor of the man\r\n     by whom it had been discovered. This motion was adopted by the\r\n     Captain's companions, and after drinking from a spring of ice-cold\r\n     water which bubbled up at their feet, the party re-embarked. LAKE\r\n     GLAZIER is about two miles in greatest diameter, with clear, deep\r\n     waters and wooded shores, being altogether a prettier lake than\r\n     Itasca and both wider and deeper, to whose honors, as source of the\r\n     mighty Mississippi, it succeeds.\r\n\r\n     \"_Reporter._--Then which way did you proceed?\"\r\n\r\n     \"_Mr. Paine._--From LAKE GLAZIER the descent of the river began.\r\n     Below Itasca it runs in a northerly direction for a hundred miles\r\n     or more, and then swings round to the eastward, finally bending\r\n     toward the south, which general direction it afterwards maintains.\r\n     For the first few miles it runs between rich meadows, and the\r\n     canoeists expected from this that the voyage would be easy and\r\n     agreeable. Such was not our fortune, however, for we soon found the\r\n     river to be obstructed by snags, drift-wood and boulders of all\r\n     sizes. Huge trees had in many places fallen completely across the\r\n     river. These obstacles were surmounted in different ways. Sometimes\r\n     the canoes could be pressed down and made to go under the logs;\r\n     again, they would have to be carried around; sometimes the drift\r\n     would be removed, and sometimes the canoes would be lifted over. At\r\n     last they had to be carried across a portage for half a mile, then\r\n     launched again, until at length the obstructions were passed.\r\n     Meanwhile, and all through the journey, the mosquitoes hovered\r\n     around us in clouds, making life a burden, and causing all the\r\n     members of the expedition to forget their early Christian training.\r\n\r\n     \"Leaving the obstructions behind, we sped smoothly between the\r\n     waving meadows once more lining the river. But a new hardship now\r\n     threatened us--our rations gave out entirely, and most of the\r\n     ammunition having become wet, starvation stared us in the face. To\r\n     buy anything in that wild country was, of course, impossible. This\r\n     danger was barely averted by the marksmanship of our leader, and\r\n     the dexterity of the Indian guides, who would occasionally kill a\r\n     duck with their paddles. We got down at last to 'hard pan,' and had\r\n     gone without any breakfast or supper the day we reached Lake\r\n     Bemidji. Here we were lucky enough to meet an Indian, who had a\r\n     little flour and pork, and having replenished our larder, we\r\n     crossed the lake and continued our course down the river.\r\n\r\n     \"A new danger now beset us in the shape of rapids which would occur\r\n     every few miles, rendering canoe navigation extremely hazardous.\r\n     Several times holes were stove in the thin birchen canoes, and a\r\n     number of times we were precipitated into the water, but no one was\r\n     dangerously hurt, and the guides were very deft in repairing the\r\n     canoes.\r\n\r\n     \"A half-day's journey from Lake Bemidji is Cass Lake, a fine sheet\r\n     of water, twenty miles in length by ten wide. The next day,\r\n     Winnibegoshish, the largest lake of the Mississippi, was reached.\r\n     It is twenty miles in diameter, and greeted us with a heavy sea,\r\n     which nearly swamped us as we paddled across the corner to a few\r\n     scattered wigwams which form the little Indian village on its\r\n     banks. Two days we were wind-bound, getting away on the morning of\r\n     the third. That night our camp was invaded by a number of hostile\r\n     Indians, but, owing to our vigilance, bloodshed was avoided.\r\n\r\n     \"In three days more Pokegama Falls were reached, and we saw the\r\n     first white man since leaving Leech Lake. Making a portage around\r\n     the falls, we shot Grand Rapids a few miles below, and slept that\r\n     night beneath the shelter of a roof. Nothing worthy of mention\r\n     occurred between this point and Aitkin, which we reached in four\r\n     days, and at last found ourselves within the bounds of\r\n     civilization, and bade farewell to our Indian guides. Captain\r\n     Glazier tried to induce these dusky sons of the forest to accompany\r\n     him to the Gulf, but the stories they had heard of the alligators\r\n     and snakes of the Sunny South terrified them, and they refused. A\r\n     short rest was taken at Aitkin, and then we re-embarked in the\r\n     pretty modern canoes which awaited us there. The descent of the\r\n     river in these canoes was easy and pleasant. At all the principal\r\n     towns the Captain delivered his lecture, 'Pioneers of the\r\n     Mississippi,' which was listened to with great interest.\r\n\r\n     \"Between Aitkin and Saint Paul numerous and dangerous rapids were\r\n     met, all of which were shot in safety; and the Falls of Saint\r\n     Anthony reached without accident. Below Saint Anthony Falls the\r\n     scenery is very beautiful, high bluffs arising with more or less\r\n     abruptness from the water's edge.\r\n\r\n     \"Among other points of especial interest along the Upper\r\n     Mississippi, Lake Pepin occupies the most prominent position after\r\n     Saint Anthony Falls. Environed by majestic bluffs and with a length\r\n     of thirty miles it forms a very beautiful sheet of water. But\r\n     though beautiful it is treacherous, and the winds sweeping down\r\n     between the high bluffs frequently make navigation on its waters\r\n     perilous. In the morning when we reached its upper end we found to\r\n     our dismay that the elements had possession, and the waves ran so\r\n     high that a number of river steamers had been compelled to tie up\r\n     and wait for the storm to subside. Captain Glazier, however, having\r\n     a lecture appointment at Lake City, half way down the lake,\r\n     determined to keep his appointment despite the weather, and\r\n     ventured forth regardless of the warning of the river men. It took\r\n     us all day to paddle a distance of sixteen miles, and many times it\r\n     seemed that our frail boats would be engulfed by the waves which\r\n     dashed over them; but the danger was passed in safety.\r\n\r\n     \"From this point things went smoothly until the canoe fleet was\r\n     just below Winona, when a sudden and violent squall struck the\r\n     boats and came near sending us to the bottom. Fortunately, this too\r\n     was weathered, and then the only drawbacks encountered were the\r\n     continuous and strong headwinds and the seas consequent upon them,\r\n     which tried our nerves so frequently that they came at length to be\r\n     naturally expected. While on the Keokuk Rapids the wind blew so\r\n     strongly that it actually carried the boats up stream, and it was\r\n     only by the hardest paddling that any downward progress could be\r\n     made.\r\n\r\n     \"At La Crosse the expedition was reduced in number to the Captain\r\n     and myself, who proceeded to the Gulf in the _Alice_. Some days\r\n     were spent in all the principal towns. On October eighth Saint\r\n     Louis was reached, and we were welcomed by the various boat-clubs\r\n     of the city and congratulated on having completed the first great\r\n     section of the navigable river. On October tenth we re-embarked and\r\n     pushed on towards the mouth of the river. Everywhere we were\r\n     received with the greatest cordiality. Cairo, Memphis, Vicksburg,\r\n     Natchez and Baton Rouge were the chief halting places, but\r\n     frequently night overtook us near some plantation house, and then\r\n     we were the guests of the planters, and were entertained with true\r\n     Southern hospitality.\r\n\r\n     \"Special occasion was taken by Captain Glazier to investigate the\r\n     cotton and sugar crops, the relations of the white and colored\r\n     races, and the future possibilities of the South; and with very\r\n     gratifying results. At last New Orleans was reached.\r\n\r\n     \"As it was so near his journey's end, and as it was his intention\r\n     to return as soon as he had passed through the Jetties, the Captain\r\n     determined to pass the city on his downward trip without halting.\r\n     This was accordingly done, and three days' paddling brought us to\r\n     Captain Eads' great work. Remaining there a day we returned to the\r\n     city.\r\n\r\n     \"Thus far Mr. Paine; and thus ended the longest canoe voyage ever\r\n     made, and one which perhaps entailed more hardships on those who\r\n     made it than any other on record. Starting from the cold springs at\r\n     its source Captain Glazier followed the windings of the greatest\r\n     river on our continent from the pine forests and the wheat lands of\r\n     the extreme Northern States, through all the varying phases of\r\n     climate and industries, to the cotton and sugar-cane section of the\r\n     South; past the orange and banana groves, and on to the broad Gulf.\r\n     Such a journey is full of interesting and strange experiences,\r\n     pleasures and hardships intermingled, and has, Captain Glazier\r\n     thinks, fully repaid the cost in time, money and labor of the\r\n     undertaking.\r\n\r\n     \"The canoe in which this long voyage was made has been presented by\r\n     the Captain to the New Orleans Academy of Sciences.\r\n\r\n     \"It may be well to mention that no one else has ever traversed\r\n     either in canoe, steamboat or otherwise more than two-thirds of the\r\n     course of the Mississippi; and when it is taken into consideration\r\n     that the distance is considerably over three thousand miles, and\r\n     that the upper portion is filled with rapids, logs and other\r\n     obstructions, it is not to be wondered at.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. RECEPTION AT NEW ORLEANS AND SAINT LOUIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn his return to New Orleans from the Gulf, with the purpose of viewing\r\nthe great maritime city of the South, Captain Glazier was met by Dr. J.\r\nS. Copes, President of the New Orleans Academy of Sciences. This\r\ngentleman introduced him to Mayor Shakespear, and arrangements were at\r\nonce made for a public reception by the Academy. The following\r\ninteresting account of the ceremony is taken from the New Orleans\r\n_Picayune_ of November twenty-first, 1881, and shows the estimate placed\r\non the Captain's exploratory labors by many of the most prominent\r\nresidents of the Crescent City:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"The termination of the exploring expedition and canoe trip of\r\n     Captain Willard Glazier, extending from his new-found source of the\r\n     Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico, culminated, after a voyage of\r\n     one hundred and seventeen days, in a very general and complimentary\r\n     recognition and ovation on the part of the officials and citizens\r\n     of New Orleans. In company with Dr. J. S. Copes, President of the\r\n     Academy of Sciences, Captain Glazier was presented to His Honor,\r\n     Mayor Shakespear was warmly welcomed, and the freedom of the city\r\n     tendered him.\r\n\r\n     \"In appreciation of the generous hospitality extended to him, the\r\n     Captain expressed a wish to present his beautiful canoe, which had\r\n     safely carried him through his long voyage, to the Academy of\r\n     Sciences, and the following letter accompanied the presentation:\r\n\r\n                                                \"'Saint Charles Hotel,\r\n                                           \"'_New Orleans, Louisiana_,\r\n                                                  \"'November 21, 1881.\r\n\r\n     \"'_Joseph S.

D._,\r\n        \"'_President--New Orleans Academy of Sciences:_\r\n\r\n     \"'Dear Sir:--I have just concluded upon the border of the State of\r\n     Louisiana a voyage of observation, exploration, and discovery; and,\r\n     as you have expressed considerable interest in the results, and\r\n     manifested a desire to possess the canoe in which the voyage was\r\n     made, I find pleasure in presenting it to your honorable society as\r\n     a souvenir of my expedition.\r\n\r\n     \"'During this canoe journey of over three thousand miles, beginning\r\n     at the headwaters of the Mississippi and extending to the Gulf of\r\n     Mexico, I had the satisfaction of locating the source of the Great\r\n     River which we have traversed, and feel a pride in having corrected\r\n     a geographical error of half a century's standing.\r\n\r\n     \"'I will not now enter into a detailed account of my explorations\r\n     on the upper Mississippi, but shall take the earliest opportunity\r\n     of transmitting to your Secretary a complete narrative of the\r\n     voyage, which will be issued in book form as soon as the matter\r\n     can be prepared for publication.\r\n\r\n                     \"'Very respectfully yours,\r\n                                   \"'Willard Glazier.'\r\n\r\n     \"A special meeting of the Academy of Sciences was held--Dr. J. S.\r\n     Copes, President, in the chair--for the purpose of receiving from\r\n     Captain Glazier the handsome cedar canoe _Alice_, with which he had\r\n     navigated the Mississippi from Aitkin to the Gulf.\r\n\r\n     \"By invitation, Captain Glazier gave an account of his explorations\r\n     on the Upper Mississippi, and especially of that section of country\r\n     beyond Lake Itasca, a body of water which has hitherto been\r\n     considered the fountain-head of the Great River.\r\n\r\n     \"Dr. Copes, in the name of the Academy, thanked Captain Glazier for\r\n     his valuable gift, which would be highly prized, and then\r\n     congratulated him upon his contribution to American geographical\r\n     knowledge. In the course of his remarks, the learned doctor said\r\n     that De Soto penetrated the continent of North America in pursuit\r\n     of gold, and accidentally discovered the Mississippi. Marquette,\r\n     the zealous missionary, traversed the river from the mouth of the\r\n     Wisconsin to the mouth of the Arkansas. La Salle pursued his\r\n     explorations from the mouth of the Illinois to the Gulf, his sole\r\n     aim seeming to be the conquest of North America in the name of the\r\n     King of France. Hennepin explored but a small section of the\r\n     stream, extending from the mouth of the Wisconsin to Saint Anthony\r\n     Falls; while Willard Glazier had made the discovery of its primal\r\n     reservoir, and traversed its entire length from source to sea.\r\n\r\n     \"The members of the Academy listened with great interest to Captain\r\n     Glazier's account of his explorations and discovery, and also to\r\n     the historical address of the President.\r\n\r\n     \"Dr. J. R. Walker then offered the following resolutions:\r\n\r\n     \"'_Resolved_, That the thanks of this Academy are due, and are\r\n     hereby tendered, to Captain Willard Glazier for the donation of his\r\n     beautiful canoe, _Alice_, and for the brief narrative of his\r\n     explorations at the source of the Mississippi River, and of his\r\n     voyage thence to the Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\n     \"'_Resolved_, That this Academy not only gratefully accepts this\r\n     handsome gift, but promises to preserve and cherish it as a\r\n     souvenir of Captain Glazier's high qualities as an explorer and\r\n     contributor to the increase of American geographical knowledge.'\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. H. Dudley Coleman then moved that a copy of the resolutions be\r\n     appropriately written and framed, and presented to Captain Glazier;\r\n     and that a committee of three be appointed to prepare the same.\r\n\r\n     \"The resolutions were unanimously adopted, when Dr. Copes appointed\r\n     as the committee Messrs. Coleman, Walker, and Blanchard.\r\n\r\n     \"At the conclusion of the meeting, Mr. Coleman escorted Captain\r\n     Glazier to the Washington Artillery Arsenal, and introduced him to\r\n     Colonel J. B. Richardson, commanding the battalion, who extended to\r\n     Captain Glazier the hospitalities of the battalion during his stay\r\n     in the city.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nBEFORE THE MISSOURI HISTORICAL SOCIETY.\r\n\r\nCaptain Glazier returned to Saint Louis from New Orleans, having engaged\r\nto deliver a lecture in that city on the \"Pioneers of the Mississippi.\"\r\nOn his voyage down the river and visit to the city, he was unable to\r\nremain long enough to fulfil the engagement, as winter was rapidly\r\napproaching, and it was expedient to reach the Gulf as soon as possible.\r\nMoreover, he wished to present one of his canoes--the _Itasca_--to the\r\nMissouri Historical Society, in return for the hospitality he had\r\nreceived during his previous brief visit; and it was arranged that the\r\npresentation should take place on the night of the lecture. Accordingly,\r\non the evening of January fourteenth, 1882, an audience consisting of\r\nmembers of the Historical Society, the Academy of Sciences, clergy,\r\nofficers and teachers of the public schools, and the several boat clubs\r\nof the city, assembled at Mercantile Library Hall, to listen to his\r\nlecture on the pioneer explorers of the Great River, and to witness the\r\npresentation of the _Itasca_.\r\n\r\nAt eight o'clock, Captain Glazier, accompanied by Judge Albert Todd,\r\nVice-President of the Historical Society, appeared on the platform, and\r\nthe Judge introduced the lecturer in the following terms, as reported in\r\nthe local press:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Mark Twain wrote that in his Oriental travels he visited the grave\r\n     of our common ancestor, Adam, and, as a filial mourner, he\r\n     copiously wept over it. To me the grave of our common ancestress,\r\n     Eve, would be more worthy of my filial affection, but, instead of\r\n     weeping over it, I should proudly rejoice by reason of her\r\n     irrepressible desire for knowledge. She boldly gratified this\r\n     desire, and thereby lifted Adam up from the indolent, browsing life\r\n     that he seemed disposed and content to pass in the 'Garden,' and\r\n     gave birth to that spirit of inquiry and investigation which is\r\n     developing and elevating their posterity to 'man's pride of\r\n     place'--'a little lower than the angels'--by keeping them ever\r\n     discontented with the _status quo_, and constantly pressing on to\r\n     the 'mark of their high calling' beneath the blazing legend\r\n     'Excelsior.' It is this ceaseless unrest of the spirit, one of the\r\n     greatest evidences of the soul's immortality, that is continually\r\n     contracting the boundaries of the unknown in geography and\r\n     astronomy, in physics and metaphysics, in all their varied\r\n     departments. Of those pre-eminently illustrating it in geography\r\n     were Jason and his Argonauts; Columbus, De Gama, and Magellan; De\r\n     Soto, Marquette, and La Salle; Cabot and Cook; Speke, Baker,\r\n     Livingstone, and Franklin; and our own Ledyard, Lewis, Clarke,\r\n     Kane, Hall, and Stanley. And this evening will appear before you\r\n     another of these irrepressible discontents who would know what is\r\n     still hidden, at any risk or privation.\r\n\r\n     \"Impelled by this spirit of enterprise, in search of truth, Captain\r\n     Willard Glazier has discovered, at last, the true source of our\r\n     grand and peerless river, the 'Father of Waters,' down which he has\r\n     floated and paddled in frail canoes, a distance of more than three\r\n     thousand miles, to its mouth in the Gulf of Mexico. One of these\r\n     canoes is now placed here in your view, and will be presented\r\n     to-night by its navigator to our Historical Society. Nearly two\r\n     hundred years ago La Salle discovered the mouth of the Mississippi,\r\n     yet only now in this year of grace, 1881, was ascertained its true\r\n     fountain source.\r\n\r\n     \"This, the latest achievement of Captain Glazier, is only in the\r\n     natural course of his antecedents. Born as late as 1841, he has\r\n     already gone through the experiences of the Adamic labors of a\r\n     tiller of the soil, the hard toils of the student and of the\r\n     successful teacher; of the dashing and brilliant cavalry officer in\r\n     the Union army through the whole period of our late war, from its\r\n     disastrous beginning to its successful ending; of the sufferings of\r\n     capture and imprisonment in the notorious 'Libby,' and other\r\n     prisons, and of a daring and perilous escape from their cruel\r\n     walls; of an adventurous tourist on horseback through the most\r\n     civilized and savage portions of our continent, beginning with the\r\n     feet of his horse in the waters of the Atlantic, and ending with\r\n     their splash in the waters of the Pacific. He delivered lectures\r\n     along his route wherever a civilized audience could be collected,\r\n     and suffered capture by the Indians, with all its sensational\r\n     romance and hideous prospects.\r\n\r\n     \"From the material of these antecedents he has written and\r\n     published several books of singular interest and national value.\r\n\r\n     \"From this brief sketch we would naturally expect to see a stalwart\r\n     man, massive and powerful in form and muscle. Our conceptions of\r\n     men of big deeds is that they are also big. But David was a\r\n     stripling when he slew Goliath of Gath. Napoleon was characterized\r\n     by the society ladies of the period of his early career as 'Puss in\r\n     Boots,' Our own Fremont and Eads would seem at sight capable of\r\n     only the ordinarily exposed duties of life. Of like physique is the\r\n     subject of this introduction.\r\n\r\n     \"Ladies and gentlemen, it is now my pleasant privilege to introduce\r\n     to your acquaintance Captain Willard Glazier as the lecturer for\r\n     the evening.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Glazier then delivered his interesting historical lecture on the\r\n\"Pioneers of the Mississippi.\" The adventures and discoveries of De\r\nSoto, Marquette, La Salle, Hennepin, Joliet, and others, including the\r\nmore recent explorers, Pike, Beltrami, Schoolcraft, and Nicollet, were\r\nintelligently discussed, and the attention of all present absorbed by\r\nthe interest of the subject. He spoke of the ambition of De Soto to\r\nfound an empire like that of Cortez in Mexico; of his arrival on the\r\nbanks of the Great River, and finally of his death and burial in its\r\ndepths. Concerning Father Marquette, the lecturer dwelt upon the zeal\r\nwith which he preached the Gospel to the benighted Indians, and his\r\npremature death and burial in the wilderness. La Salle was then\r\npresented as an intrepid pioneer, pushing down the mighty river to plant\r\nhis banner on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, and taking possession of\r\nthe country through which he had passed in the name of the King of\r\nFrance. The exploits of Hennepin, Joliet, and others were then\r\nrecounted, and the lecturer gave evidence of great familiarity with the\r\nlives of these heroic pioneer explorers of the Mississippi. The\r\nfollowing letter was then read:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 \"1310 Olive Street,\r\n\r\n                                             \"_Saint Louis, Missouri_,\r\n\r\n                                                 \"January 14, 1882.\r\n\r\n     \"_Edwin Harrison, Esq.,_\r\n\r\n        \"_President Missouri Historical Society_:\r\n\r\n     \"Dear Sir:--In my recent canoe voyage down the Mississippi it was\r\n     my good fortune to receive many courtesies at the hands of the\r\n     press, boat clubs, and citizens of Saint Louis. This, coupled with\r\n     the fact that you have expressed considerable interest in the\r\n     result of my explorations, inclines me to present to you the\r\n     _Itasca_, one of the canoes used in the expedition, for the museum\r\n     of your Society, as a memento of my voyage and discovery.\r\n\r\n     \"During this tour of observation, extending from the headwaters of\r\n     the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico, I had the satisfaction\r\n     of locating the true source of the mighty stream down which we\r\n     paddled our canoes to the sea.\r\n\r\n     \"I am not now able to give you a detailed account of my voyage, but\r\n     shall avail myself of the earliest opportunity to transmit to your\r\n     Secretary a complete history of it, which will be issued in book\r\n     form as soon as the material can be put in proper shape for\r\n     publication.\r\n\r\n                            \"Very truly yours,\r\n\r\n                                                      Willard Glazier.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Silas Bent, late of the U. S. N., accepted the canoe for the\r\nsociety, in the following words:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Captain Glazier:\r\n\r\n     \"It becomes my pleasant duty to accept, for the Missouri Historical\r\n     Society, this beautiful canoe, which has itself become historic by\r\n     reason of the service it has rendered you. It shall be deposited\r\n     with other treasured relics in our museum.\r\n\r\n     \"I have also to express to you the high appreciation in which the\r\n     Society holds the valuable contribution to geographical knowledge\r\n     resulting from your explorations among the headwaters of the\r\n     Mississippi River, and your discovery of the remotest lake that\r\n     contributes to the perennial birth of this hydra-headed 'Father of\r\n     Waters,' whose genesis near the Arctic regions gives it a length of\r\n     more than three thousand miles to the tropical gulf, to which it\r\n     bears upon its ample bosom in safety the freightage of an empire.\r\n\r\n     \"I desire, too, to thank you for the interesting lecture just given\r\n     us upon the achievements of the heroic old explorers, who have, in\r\n     centuries past, preceded you in investigations of the\r\n     characteristics of this river. But whilst past investigations have\r\n     made us familiar with the general character of the stream, and the\r\n     peculiarities of its many mouths, yet we know very little of its\r\n     source; and should be gratified, I am sure, if you could give us,\r\n     this evening, a brief account of the circumstances attending your\r\n     explorations in that direction, and of the difficulties you had to\r\n     encounter in the accomplishment of your object.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn compliance with Captain Bent's request that he would give some\r\naccount of the events connected with the expedition to the source of the\r\nMississippi, Captain Glazier then briefly narrated the leading incidents\r\nof his voyage and explorations. At the conclusion, several gentlemen\r\ncame forward to congratulate him upon the practical results of his\r\nundertaking and expressed their appreciation of the work he had\r\naccomplished. The _Itasca_, which occupied a prominent position on the\r\nplatform, was duly inspected, and afterwards removed to the rooms of the\r\nHistorical Society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. LETTERS PERTINENT TO THE SUBJECT.\r\n\r\n\r\nA letter from Captain Glazier which appeared in the Saint Paul _Pioneer\r\nPress_ in December, 1886, and was copied into several Eastern papers, is\r\nhere introduced as an epitomized narrative of the discovery. The journey\r\nto the headwaters of the Mississippi, the launch of the canoes on Lake\r\nItasca, the search for its feeders and the finding of one larger than\r\nthe others which the Indian guides said flowed from another lake to the\r\nsouth of it; the passage of the canoes up this feeder and the entrance\r\nof the explorers upon a beautiful lake which they ascertained by\r\nsounding and measurement to be wider and deeper than Itasca, and _the\r\nveritable source of the Great River_; all this is succinctly told in the\r\nfollowing letter of the leader of the expedition, and we respectfully\r\ncommend its perusal to the reader:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"_To the Editor--Pioneer Press, Saint Paul, Minnesota_:\r\n\r\n     \"I solicit the favor of replying through your columns to articles\r\n     in one or two New York dailies calling in question my claim to have\r\n     definitely located, in 1881, the true source of the Mississippi\r\n     River.\r\n\r\n     \"When my attention was first drawn to the articles of those who\r\n     seem so much exercised by my expedition to the headwaters of the\r\n     Mississippi, I had no intention of replying, but have finally\r\n     yielded to the reasoning of friends who feel that longer silence\r\n     might possibly be construed to my disadvantage.\r\n\r\n     \"I am well aware that I assume grave responsibility in locating the\r\n     source of the greatest river of North America and correcting a\r\n     geographical error of half a century's standing, especially since I\r\n     follow in the footsteps of such eminent explorers as Pike,\r\n     Beltrami, Schoolcraft and Nicollet; and in view of the fact that I\r\n     have presumed to pass the limit of their explorations.\r\n\r\n     \"For many years prior to 1881, I had been of the opinion that Lake\r\n     Itasca occupied an erroneous position in our geography. In fact I\r\n     had become satisfied through conversations with straggling\r\n     Chippewas in the Northwest, that the red man's ideal river did not\r\n     rise in the lake described by his white brother, but that there\r\n     were other lakes and streams beyond that lake and that some day the\r\n     truth of their statements would be verified.\r\n\r\n     \"Thoroughly convinced that there was yet a field for exploration in\r\n     the wilds of Northern Minnesota I resolved, in 1876, to attempt a\r\n     settlement of the vexed question concerning the source of the\r\n     Mississippi at an early day. Finding the opportunity I sought in\r\n     1881 I proceeded to Saint Paul in June of that year accompanied by\r\n     Pearce Giles, of Camden, New Jersey. Here I was joined by my\r\n     brother George, of Chicago, and Barrett Channing Paine, then an\r\n     attache of the _Pioneer Press_.\r\n\r\n     \"Having completed arrangements we moved from Saint Paul on the\r\n     morning of July Fourth with Brainerd as our immediate objective.\r\n     Short stops were made at Minneapolis, Monticello, Saint Cloud and\r\n     Little Falls on our way up the river. Brainerd was reached July\r\n     seventh. This enterprising town is situated near the boundary of\r\n     the Chippewa Indian Reservation and is the nearest place of\r\n     consequence to Lake Itasca. Here I again halted to further inform\r\n     myself concerning the topography of the country; to decide upon the\r\n     most practicable route to our destination, and to provide such\r\n     extra supplies of rations and clothing as might be considered\r\n     adequate to the requirements of our undertaking.\r\n\r\n     \"After consulting our maps I concluded that while Schoolcraft and\r\n     Nicollet had found Itasca by going up the river through Lakes\r\n     Winnibegoshish, Cass and Bemidji, a more direct course would be by\r\n     way of Leech Lake and the Kabekanka River.\r\n\r\n     \"A careful study of the route to Leech Lake, with a few valuable\r\n     suggestions from Warren Leland, of Brainerd, one of its oldest\r\n     pioneers, led us to seek conveyance to the former place over what\r\n     is known in Northern Minnesota as the Government Road. This road\r\n     stretches for seventy-five miles, through immense pine forests, and\r\n     the only habitations to be seen from it are the 'half-way houses'\r\n     erected for the accommodation of teamsters who are engaged in\r\n     hauling government supplies; and the occasional wigwams of\r\n     wandering Indians.\r\n\r\n     \"While at the Leech Lake Agency it was our good fortune to meet the\r\n     post-missionary, Rev. Edwin Benedict; Major A. C. Ruffe, the Indian\r\n     Agent; Paul Beaulieu, the veteran Government Interpreter;\r\n     White-Cloud, chief of the Mississippi Indians; Flat-Mouth, head\r\n     chief of the Chippewas, and others well known at the Agency.\r\n     Through conversations with these parties I learned that pioneers of\r\n     that region were of the opinion that the lake located by\r\n     Schoolcraft was the source of the Mississippi, but that the Indians\r\n     invariably claimed that the Great River had its origin above and\r\n     beyond Itasca, in a beautiful lake known to them as Pokegama,\r\n     signifying the 'place where the waters gather.'\r\n\r\n     \"Beaulieu, who is perhaps the best authority in Minnesota, having\r\n     lived for more than sixty years within its borders, said that\r\n     Chenowagesic, who afterwards became my chief guide, was the most\r\n     intelligent Chippewa of his acquaintance, had made his home for\r\n     many years in the vicinity of the headwaters of the Mississippi,\r\n     and that he had always asserted, when maps were shown him, that a\r\n     lake above Itasca would in time change a feature of those maps and\r\n     confirm his statement that Lake Itasca could not longer maintain\r\n     its claim to being the fountain-head of the Great River.\r\n\r\n     \"Three days were spent at Leech Lake, during which time we secured\r\n     an interpreter, Indian guides and birch bark canoes. Everything\r\n     being in order we launched our canoes on the morning of July\r\n     seventeenth. Wishing, as previously explained, to approach Itasca\r\n     by a different route from that adopted by Schoolcraft and Nicollet\r\n     who went up the Mississippi from Lake Winnibegoshish, I crossed\r\n     Leech Lake and ascended the Kabekanka River, thence proceeding in a\r\n     direct westerly course through twenty-one lakes, alternated by as\r\n     many portages, reaching Itasca between two and three o'clock on\r\n     the afternoon of the twenty-first. The region traversed, we were\r\n     told by the guides, had never before been trodden by white men; and\r\n     considering the nature of the country it is not to be wondered at,\r\n     as swamps, floating bogs, and dense undergrowth were encountered\r\n     throughout the entire journey.\r\n\r\n     \"The work of coasting Itasca for its feeders was begun at an early\r\n     hour on the morning of the twenty-second. We found the outlets of\r\n     six small streams, two having well-defined mouths, and four\r\n     filtering into the lake through bogs. The upper or southern end of\r\n     the south-western arm of Lake Itasca is heavily margined with reeds\r\n     and rushes, and it was not without considerable difficulty that we\r\n     forced our way through this barrier into the larger of the two open\r\n     streams which enter at this point. This stream, at its mouth, is\r\n     seven feet wide and about three feet deep.\r\n\r\n     \"Slow and sinuous progress of between two and three hundred yards\r\n     brought us to a blockade of logs and shallow water. Determined to\r\n     float in my canoe upon the surface of the lake towards which we\r\n     were paddling, I directed the guides to remove the obstructions,\r\n     and continued to urge the canoes rapidly forward, although opposed\r\n     by a strong and constantly increasing current. On pulling and\r\n     pushing our way through a network of rushes, similar to that\r\n     encountered on leaving Lake Itasca, the cheering sight of a\r\n     tranquil and limpid sheet of water burst upon our view.\r\n\r\n     \"This lake, the Chippewa name of which is _Pokegama_, is about a\r\n     mile and a half in its greatest diameter, covers an area of two\r\n     hundred and fifty acres, and would be nearly an oval in form but\r\n     for a single promontory, which extends its shores into the lake, so\r\n     as to give it in outline the appearance of a heart. Its feeders are\r\n     three small creeks, two of which enter on the right and left of the\r\n     headland, and have their origin in springs at the foot of sand\r\n     hills from two to three miles distant. The third stream is but\r\n     little more than a rivulet of a mile in length, has no clearly\r\n     defined course, and is the outlet of a small pond or lakelet to the\r\n     south-westward.\r\n\r\n     \"The latitude of the lake in question is about 47 deg.; its height\r\n     above the Atlantic Ocean 1,582 feet, and its distance from the Gulf\r\n     of Mexico 3,184 miles.\r\n\r\n     \"The statement that the lake now very generally accepted by\r\n     geographers, and educational publishers as the True Source of the\r\n     Mississippi was so regarded prior to the organization of my\r\n     expedition cannot be substantiated; for, on the contrary, both\r\n     press and people throughout Minnesota were ignorant of its\r\n     existence, so far as we were able to ascertain by diligent inquiry\r\n     from Saint Paul to Brainerd; and, in fact, I may add that the\r\n     missionary, Indian agent, and post-trader at Leech Lake knew no\r\n     other source of the Mississippi than Lake Itasca, except what they\r\n     had been told by my chief guide, Chenowagesic, and a few other\r\n     Chippewas in that vicinity. Barrett Channing Paine, fully confirms\r\n     this statement in his letters to the Brainerd, Minneapolis, and\r\n     Saint Paul papers of that period. These letters prove most\r\n     conclusively that the people of Northern Minnesota had no knowledge\r\n     whatever of the lake beyond Itasca until its existence was\r\n     announced by me through the medium of the press in 1881.\r\n\r\n     \"If the assumption by some writers that the lake to the south of\r\n     Itasca had been seen before my visit to that region in 1881 is well\r\n     grounded, I need only say in reply that it had not been assigned\r\n     any geographical importance prior to my visit; in other words, it\r\n     had not been recognized by any one as the true source of the\r\n     Mississippi.\r\n\r\n     \"When William Morrison, the fur-trader, pitched his tent on\r\n     Schoolcraft Island in 1804, he evidently did not know that the\r\n     outlet of the lake on which he looked was a part of the mighty\r\n     river. Schoolcraft followed, at the head of an expedition\r\n     twenty-eight years later, and claimed the lake as the source of the\r\n     Mississippi. It is very generally admitted that Morrison had seen\r\n     Itasca before Schoolcraft, but no one questioned that the latter\r\n     was entitled to the credit of discovery, since he was the first to\r\n     establish the fact that the Mississippi was its outlet. My claim to\r\n     have definitely located the _true source_ in the lake beyond Itasca\r\n     stands on precisely the same ground.\r\n\r\n     \"I do not desire to pass a reasonable limit in an effort to insure\r\n     justice, but having consumed considerable time and money in\r\n     locating lakes and streams in Northern Minnesota, and having\r\n     established that the lake to the south of Itasca is the primal\r\n     reservoir of the Mississippi, I do not feel disposed to allow\r\n     myself to be thrust aside by those who know comparatively little or\r\n     nothing of that region.\r\n\r\n     \"Assuming that the statements of my party are incontrovertible\r\n     concerning the lake which we claim as the True Source of the Great\r\n     River, it follows naturally:\r\n\r\n     \"I. That Lake Itasca cannot longer be recognized as the\r\n     fountain-head of the Mississippi, for the reason that it is the\r\n     custom, agreeably to the definition of geographers, to fix upon the\r\n     remotest water, and a lake if possible, as the source of a river.\r\n\r\n     \"II.

Being at a loss for an appropriate name\r\n     to bestow upon the lake which constituted this supposed source, so\r\n     the story goes, he asked a companion what were the Latin words\r\n     signifying 'true head,' and received in reply '_veritas caput_.'\r\n     This was rather a ponderous name to give a comparatively small body\r\n     of water, even though the Father of Waters here took his first\r\n     start in the world. The explorer, therefore, conceived the idea of\r\n     uniting the last two syllables of the first word with the first\r\n     syllable of the second, thus, by a novel mode of orthography,\r\n     forming a name which might easily pass for one of Indian\r\n     origin--_Itasca_. A person versed in orthographical science would\r\n     probably perceive at once that the name did not belong to the same\r\n     family of harsh Indian appellations which have affixed themselves\r\n     permanently to many towns and rivers in Wisconsin and Minnesota,\r\n     but was more allied to the softer language of southern Indian\r\n     nations. But it has now been discovered that Lake Itasca is not\r\n     _veritas caput_; and LAKE GLAZIER, discovered in July, 1881, by\r\n     Captain Willard Glazier, must be regarded by all future generations\r\n     as the true head of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\n     \"The Mississippi, on its first stages, flows in a northerly\r\n     direction, the whole system of small lakes which contribute to it\r\n     being surrounded on the north and west by an amphitheatre of hills.\r\n     LAKE GLAZIER lies above and beyond Lake Itasca, and its waters have\r\n     an elevation of probably seven feet above that lake, being\r\n     connected therewith by a small, swift stream. Lake Itasca is\r\n     composed of three arms, extending in the form of a trefoil, having\r\n     a length of five miles and an average width of about one mile. The\r\n     upper, or southern end of its middle arm apparently terminates in a\r\n     swamp, which might easily have deceived any one not familiar with\r\n     the country. But Chenowagesic, Captain Glazier's Indian guide, who\r\n     had for years used the region of these lakes for his\r\n     hunting-ground, readily made his way through the reeds and rushes\r\n     at the mouth of the connecting stream. LAKE GLAZIER at its outlet\r\n     presents another barricade of reeds, through which the party made\r\n     their way in their canoes.\r\n\r\n     \"LAKE GLAZIER is about two miles in length by a mile and a half in\r\n     breadth. Its shores, instead of being low and marshy, as are those\r\n     of many of the neighboring lakes, present finely wooded slopes and\r\n     surround the lake in what would have been the shape of a perfect\r\n     oval, had not a bold, rocky promontory indented its southern end,\r\n     and given to it the outline of a heart. On the point of this\r\n     promontory is a spring from which flows ice-cold water. The waters\r\n     of the lake are exceedingly clear and pure, proceeding from\r\n     springs, some of them in the bottom of the lake itself, and the\r\n     others at a greater or less distance from its shores.\r\n\r\n     \"LAKE GLAZIER has three small feeders, one of them named Eagle\r\n     Creek, entering it near its outlet, and taking its rise a mile or\r\n     so farther south, in a small pond or lakelet, upon which Captain\r\n     Glazier bestowed the name of 'Alice,' after his daughter. Eagle\r\n     Creek runs nearly parallel with the western shore of the lake, a\r\n     little distance from it. Two streams, two or three miles in length,\r\n     flow northward into LAKE GLAZIER at its southern extremity on\r\n     either side of the indenting promontory. Excelsior Creek, so named\r\n     because it represents the very highest water of the Mississippi, is\r\n     the longer of these. Deer Creek, to the eastward, and rising a\r\n     little nearer the lake, has been so named for the reason that\r\n     numbers of deer were seen in its vicinity.\r\n\r\n     \"LAKE GLAZIER is thus supplied by three feeders, Eagle, Excelsior\r\n     and Deer Creeks, now named in the order of their importance, and as\r\n     uniting these waters in one common reservoir, this lake is\r\n     undoubtedly entitled to be regarded as the _veritas caput_--the\r\n     true head of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\n                                                        \"Pearce Giles.\r\n\r\n     \"Boston, August 6, 1886.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe insert here an interesting letter from Paul Beaulieu, Interpreter to\r\nthe United States Indian Agency, White Earth, Minnesota.

I have received a map showing the route of exploration of\r\n     Captain Willard Glazier in 1881, and being well acquainted with his\r\n     chief guide, Chenowagesic, who has made the section of country\r\n     explored by Captain Glazier his home for many years in the past,\r\n     and who has proved the truth of his often repeated assertion, when\r\n     maps were shown him, that a smaller lake above Lake Itasca would in\r\n     time change a feature of those maps, and proclaim to the world that\r\n     Lake Itasca cannot longer maintain its claim as being the fountain\r\n     head of Ke-chee-see-be, or Great River, which is called\r\n     May-see-see-be, by the Chippewas. The map as delineated by Captain\r\n     Glazier's guide, Chenowagesic, and published by the Glazier party,\r\n     is correct; and it is plain to us who know the lay of this whole\r\n     country (I mean by _us_, the Chippewa tribe in particular, also the\r\n     recent explorers for pine) that LAKE GLAZIER is located at the\r\n     right place, and is the last lake on the longest stream of the\r\n     several rivers at the head of the great Mississippi.\r\n\r\n                       \"With respect, yours truly,\r\n\r\n                                                     \"Paul Beaulieu,\r\n\r\n                                          \"_U.

Minnesota, at the time of\r\n     my residence there, was thinly settled. Minneapolis and Saint\r\n     Anthony were both straggling villages. Saint Paul could boast of\r\n     something like 10,000 population. The nearest railroad point to the\r\n     latter city was one hundred and thirty miles distant. In winter\r\n     Burbank's Northwestern Express carried the mails and the very few\r\n     passengers that could muster courage to make the toilsome journey;\r\n     and well do I remember my trip over this route. I know that, at\r\n     that time, there was a question with the Sioux, Chippewas and many\r\n     pioneers as to Lake Itasca being the source of the Great River.\r\n     There was a settled opinion that something would be found beyond\r\n     that would eventually prove to be the source of that stream. I\r\n     believe Captain Glazier to have been actuated by a desire to\r\n     establish the truth of this problem. Interested parties may seek to\r\n     withhold from him his rightful due as a discoverer, but\r\n     notwithstanding these attempts, in some schools in this region,\r\n     LAKE GLAZIER is taught as the true source of the Mississippi. To\r\n     attempt to discredit one who took front rank for the preservation\r\n     of the Union, and who suffered in many rebel prisons, is altogether\r\n     unworthy of the parties who are making themselves conspicuous in\r\n     the matter.\r\n\r\n                                                         \"J.

Even had you never\r\n     proclaimed to the world your discoveries, from information received\r\n     by me from Indians and old mixed-blood Indian voyageurs, there\r\n     would have always been a doubt existing with me as to whether\r\n     Itasca was the head of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\n     \"Henry Beaulieu, a brother of Paul Beaulieu, always maintained that\r\n     LAKE GLAZIER was the true source of the Mississippi. I remember\r\n     that, after his return from Itasca with Mr. Chambers of the New\r\n     York _Herald_, I think in 1872, he said that Winnibegoshish or Cass\r\n     Lake might as well be called the source of the Mississippi as\r\n     Itasca. Other mixed-blood have repeatedly stated the same thing. I\r\n     mention this to show you what the general opinion is among Indians\r\n     and those of mixed blood.\r\n\r\n     \"Chenowagesic's theory concerning the head of the Mississippi is\r\n     this: That while Itasca presents a larger surface than LAKE\r\n     GLAZIER, it does not contain as much water as the latter. He\r\n     arrives at this conclusion from the fact that Itasca freezes over\r\n     two or three weeks before LAKE GLAZIER. This, he says, is a sure\r\n     sign that the latter lake is the deeper of the two, and contains\r\n     more water. His arguments in favor of LAKE GLAZIER are rather\r\n     novel, and, as a matter of course, are taken from an Indian's\r\n     standpoint.\r\n\r\n                              \"Yours truly,\r\n\r\n                                                     \"Gus.

PUBLIC OPINION IN MINNESOTA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe evidence here presented in support of LAKE GLAZIER, is, in our\r\njudgment, most conclusive; we may add, overwhelming. Many of the most\r\nprominent citizens of the State in which the Great River takes its rise\r\nvolunteer their endorsement of a claim, of the merits of which, they\r\nmust necessarily be better informed than persons living at a remote\r\ndistance from the head of the river. State authorities, including the\r\nGovernor and his staff; senators and representatives, many of whom have\r\nresided from twenty to forty years in Minnesota; pioneers, clergymen,\r\nand school-teachers, with many of the leading citizens; editors,\r\nschool-superintendents, professional men, and others, strongly affirm\r\nthat Lake Itasca is not the source of the Mississippi, but that the lake\r\nto the south of it, definitely located by Captain Glazier, is the primal\r\nreservoir or _true source_ of the Father of Waters. These witnesses,\r\nmoreover, unequivocally assert that the credit of the discovery should\r\nbe awarded to the man who made it, notwithstanding the groundless\r\nopposition of a few cavillers who have never themselves visited within\r\nmany hundred miles a region they affect to be so marvelously familiar\r\nwith.\r\n\r\n\r\n       _From His Excellency, A.

Marquette, Joliet, La Salle,\r\n     Hennepin, La Hontan, Charlevoix, Carver, Pike, Cass, and Beltrami\r\n     preceded Schoolcraft. The last named discovered a lake which he\r\n     supposed to be the source, but the Indians and the missionaries\r\n     said there was a lake beyond. A learned few believed them. It\r\n     remained for some explorer to make further investigation and\r\n     publish the truth more widely to the world. This was done by\r\n     Captain Glazier in 1881, who visited the lake, explored its shores\r\n     and found it to be wider and deeper than Itasca.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                           _Winona Republican._\r\n\r\n     \"Captain Glazier, who has won fame as the discoverer of the true\r\n     source of the Mississippi, has recently published a good-sized\r\n     volume entitled 'Down the Great River.' ...

The narrative of Captain\r\n     Glazier is interesting, because it gives a panoramic view of the\r\n     Mississippi from its source to its mouth, describing the appearance\r\n     of the river wherever tributaries enter, and noting the character\r\n     of the Indians, fur-traders, pioneers, frontiersmen, and the\r\n     agricultural and commercial communities along its course. There is,\r\n     too, a spice of personal adventure in such a journey, because for\r\n     the greater part of the trip the Captain was accompanied by only\r\n     one other person, and the novelty of riding in a canoe over every\r\n     mile of one of the greatest rivers in the world, in itself gives a\r\n     peculiar character to the record of the journey. The story is\r\n     simply the narrative of life in a canoe floating down the\r\n     Mississippi, supplemented by such historical recollections and\r\n     reminiscences as have seemed appropriate to one who is an\r\n     enthusiast in the history of exploration....\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                         _Minneapolis Star-News._\r\n\r\n     \"On the 22d day of July, 1881, the traveler and author, Captain\r\n     Willard Glazier, discovered a silvery lake nestled among the\r\n     pineries of Northern Minnesota and situate about a mile and a half\r\n     to the south of Lake Itasca. He also discovered that a swift\r\n     current flowed continuously from his new-found wonder to what was\r\n     supposed to be the source of the Father of Waters. The lake is\r\n     known to the Indians as _Pokegama_, and when it was reached by the\r\n     Glazier party they were much surprised by Chenowagesic, an Indian\r\n     chief, who had accompanied them as guide, addressing Captain\r\n     Glazier as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"'My brother, I have come with you through many lakes and rivers to\r\n     the head of the Father of Waters.

That the\r\n     lake from which the Great River starts, known by the Indians as\r\n     Lake Pokegama, should be re-named LAKE GLAZIER, seems an\r\n     appropriate honor for the resolute explorer....\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                    _La Crosse Republican and Leader._\r\n\r\n     \"'Down the Great River' is the title of a book just issued which\r\n     possesses many claims to popular favor.

No river in\r\n     the Old or New World is surrounded by so many associations, or is\r\n     so identified with the memories of discoverers and adventurers,\r\n     warrior-priests and saintly soldiers, peaceful pioneers and\r\n     devastating armies, as the Mississippi.... For half a century Lake\r\n     Itasca has been accepted as the fountain-head of the Great River,\r\n     but Captain Glazier having had reasons for doubting the correctness\r\n     of that theory, undertook, in 1881, to verify or disprove it, and\r\n     the book treats of his adventures on that mission and his\r\n     subsequent voyage by canoe down its entire length from its source\r\n     to its mouth, a distance of three thousand one hundred and\r\n     eighty-four miles....

The best part of the\r\n     discovery seems to be that Captain Glazier so explored the country\r\n     about this lake that there is no possibility of another discovery\r\n     of a connecting lake beyond it.

Strange as it may\r\n     seem, there is scarcely a wilder region on this continent than\r\n     exists in Northern Minnesota, and it has so remained in spite of\r\n     the explorations of Beltrami, Schoolcraft, and Nicollet, who,\r\n     perhaps, ought to have been a little more exhaustive in their\r\n     efforts when on the same depended the designation of the actual\r\n     source of a great river. Nevertheless, at the date above mentioned,\r\n     Captain Glazier, at the head of a small but indomitable band,\r\n     emerged from Lake Itasca, and the birch-bark canoes of the party\r\n     were urged against a strong current and a bulwark of rushes,\r\n     through a stream seven feet wide and three deep, until the clear\r\n     waters of another lake came in view. The greatest diameter of this\r\n     new body of water is about two miles, its feeders are traceable to\r\n     springs only, and hence it is unquestionably the primal source\r\n     whence the Father of Waters starts on his long journey of 3,184\r\n     miles to the Gulf of Mexico.\"...\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                          _Burlington Hawkeye._\r\n\r\n     \"In the summer of 1881, Captain Willard Glazier, well known as a\r\n     popular writer, made a remarkable canoe voyage from the source of\r\n     the Mississippi down its entire length to the Gulf of Mexico. Prior\r\n     to starting on this unprecedented voyage, he organized and led an\r\n     expedition to the headwaters of the river in Northern Minnesota,\r\n     with a view of setting at rest the vexed question as to the true\r\n     source of the mighty river. Captain Glazier and his party left\r\n     Saint Paul, duly equipped with canoes and commissariat, July\r\n     Fourth, 1881, and arrived at Lake Itasca July twenty-first. Thence,\r\n     by the aid of his Indian guides, he penetrated to another lake\r\n     beyond Itasca, and connected therewith by a stream which is a\r\n     continuation of the Mississippi, and at that point is simply a\r\n     narrow creek. The lake thus entered by Captain Glazier he claims to\r\n     be the true source of the Father of Waters.

The leading map\r\n     publishers have endorsed his claims, and do so in a way that leaves\r\n     no doubt that they place implicit confidence in him as a careful\r\n     and trustworthy geographer and historian.

The press,\r\n     bar, pulpit, and legislature of the State of Minnesota give\r\n     unqualified assent through many of their leading members, to the\r\n     position of Captain Glazier.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                             _Chicago Times._\r\n\r\n     \"The most interesting portion of Captain Glazier's 'Down the Great\r\n     River' is the beginning, where the author gives the details of an\r\n     expedition made in 1881 by himself with five companions, when he\r\n     claims, with good grounds, to have fixed the actual, true source of\r\n     the Great River. His attention was called in 1876 to the fact that,\r\n     though everybody knows the mouth of the stream, there was then much\r\n     uncertainty about the source. In 1881 he found time to organize the\r\n     expedition named, and crossing the country to Itasca, embarked and\r\n     pushed through that lake up a stream flowing into it, and came upon\r\n     another considerable body of water fed by three streams originating\r\n     in springs at the foot of a curved range of hills some miles\r\n     further on. This lake he fixed upon as the true source, and since\r\n     his published accounts many geographers and map-workers have\r\n     modified their works according to his discoveries. He does not\r\n     claim to be the actual discoverer of the lake, as such, but only to\r\n     have been the first to discover and establish the fact that it is\r\n     the highest link in a chain in which Itasca is another; or, in\r\n     other words, the true source of the river. The Indian name of the\r\n     lake is _Pokegama_, and this, the author says, he would have\r\n     retained, but was overruled by the other five, who insisted on\r\n     calling it LAKE GLAZIER. For the particulars of the interesting\r\n     story the reader must be referred to the volume itself. Captain\r\n     Glazier is an old traveler and a practised writer. The manner of\r\n     his journey down the Mississippi enabled him to see well all there\r\n     was to see, and he enables his readers to see also.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                          _Chicago Inter-Ocean._\r\n\r\n     \"Readers of 'Soldiers of the Saddle,' 'Capture, Prison-Pen and\r\n     Escape,' and other writings of Captain Glazier will require no\r\n     urging to read the entertaining volume 'Down the Great River.' It\r\n     is an account of the discovery of the true source of the\r\n     Mississippi River, with pictorial and descriptive views of cities,\r\n     towns and scenery gathered from a canoe voyage from its head waters\r\n     to the Gulf. For fifty years American youth have been taught that\r\n     'the Mississippi rises in Lake Itasca,' until Captain Glazier, in\r\n     this memorable journey of one hundred and seventeen days in his\r\n     canoe, demonstrated the error and mapped the facts so accurately as\r\n     to settle the question for all time. Leading geographers and\r\n     educational publishers have already made changes in their maps and\r\n     given due credit to Captain Glazier and his new lake. To say the\r\n     Mississippi rises in LAKE GLAZIER is only doing simple justice to\r\n     the intrepid explorer and hero of many battles. The book is\r\n     charmingly written, mainly in the form of a diary, and contains\r\n     facts of great value, so interwoven with incidents and fine\r\n     descriptions and novel adventures as to be as interesting as the\r\n     best romance. One could scarcely find better history or finer\r\n     descriptions or be more fully impressed with the breadth and length\r\n     and grandeur of American possessions than by journeying with\r\n     Captain Glazier in his canoe down the grand river of the continent.\r\n     The volume is handsomely printed and bound and well illustrated.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                        _Chicago Evening Journal._\r\n\r\n     \"However the knowledge may affect the world at large that the\r\n     source of the mighty Mississippi is other than generations of\r\n     geography students have been taught that it was, there is little\r\n     doubt left in the reader's mind, after perusing Captain Willard\r\n     Glazier's 'Down the Great River,' that we have all been in the\r\n     wrong about it, and that this most peerless river was born, not in\r\n     Itasca's sparkling springs, but in another wider and deeper lake\r\n     that lies still further south and bears the name of its discoverer,\r\n     the author of this interesting volume of exploration and adventure.\r\n     There is something charming in the simple thought of an expedition\r\n     such as the one undertaken by Captain Glazier. Imagine long, silent\r\n     days of absolutely unbroken communion with Nature! Slipping along\r\n     in a frail canoe, without the sound of an uncongenial human speech,\r\n     of clanging bells or grating wheels, through circling hours of\r\n     unbroken calm, with only the swish of bending reeds and lapping\r\n     waters to break the hush and remind one of a sentient world.\r\n     Perhaps the author and his Indian guides occasionally exchanged a\r\n     word, or the two white companions and himself indulged in a laugh\r\n     that started the rattling echoes of the hills, but there was no\r\n     chatter, no twaddle, no dissensions. The narrative reads like a\r\n     story. Reading it, one longs to start for LAKE GLAZIER to-morrow,\r\n     and thence descending, halt not in his long course until his\r\n     faithful canoe slips out into the waters of the Southern Gulf,\r\n     three thousand miles away. A man with a soul in him would rather\r\n     take such a trip with all its hardships and its perils than go on a\r\n     hundred cut-and-dried trips to Europe. The book is handsomely bound\r\n     and well illustrated.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                            _Chicago Herald._\r\n\r\n     \"For half a century or more it has been understood that Lake Itasca\r\n     was the source of the Mississippi River, but Captain Willard\r\n     Glazier has exploded this theory by a canoe voyage undertaken in\r\n     1881. The results of his investigations were given to geographers\r\n     at the time and accepted as satisfactory and complete. Maps were at\r\n     once changed by the map publishers, and LAKE GLAZIER, a tributary\r\n     of Lake Itasca, was set down as the true source of the 'Father of\r\n     Waters.' The story of Captain Glazier's adventures is told by him\r\n     in a book entitled 'Down the Great River,' which is entertaining as\r\n     well as being of importance as a contribution to the geography and\r\n     history of this country. Together with two companions and several\r\n     guides, Glazier first discovered that the lake now bearing his name\r\n     was the true source of the Great River, and then journeyed by canoe\r\n     from that point to the mouth of the Mississippi, a distance of\r\n     3,184 miles. This trip occupied one hundred and seventeen days and\r\n     was attended with various haps and mishaps and numerous adventures\r\n     of an exciting character. It is not easy from a mere book\r\n     description to realize the extent and importance of such a trip as\r\n     that made by Captain Glazier. More than a hundred days of roughing\r\n     it along one of the greatest waterways in the world could not fail\r\n     to be productive of much that would interest even a casual reader,\r\n     and as Captain Glazier is an experienced traveller and a skilled\r\n     writer, he has made the most of his opportunities.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                       _Springfield (Ohio) Times._\r\n\r\n     \"The latest book from the pen of Willard Glazier, the well-known\r\n     soldier-author, is entitled 'Down the Great River.' It is a work of\r\n     great geographical and historical value, and settles beyond\r\n     peradventure the disputed question of the true source of the\r\n     Mississippi. Aside from its scientific value, the work is a\r\n     charmingly entertaining narrative of the thrilling adventures and\r\n     amusing incidents of a canoe trip over the whole length of the\r\n     Mississippi from its source in the cold regions of the North to\r\n     where it rolls into the ocean over the burning sands of the Gulf\r\n     coast. It is highly instructive and interesting in its graphic\r\n     descriptions and character sketches, depicting the varied human\r\n     nature, local customs, and folk-lore that find habitation along the\r\n     banks of the Great River. The book is well worth the perusal of\r\n     every one, and an American library without it would be incomplete.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                          _Ohio State Journal._\r\n\r\n     \"It seems strange that for nearly fifty years up to 1881, no new\r\n     thing had been discovered concerning the great Mississippi, whose\r\n     source in the vast wilderness of the Northwest was supposed to be\r\n     in Lake Itasca. In that year, however, Captain Willard Glazier, an\r\n     adventurous spirit, determined to finally solve the mystery of the\r\n     source of the 'Father of Waters,' and also to navigate its entire\r\n     length from source to sea. Accordingly he traced with infinite\r\n     hardship the narrowing stream above Itasca until its true source\r\n     was finally reached in what is now known as LAKE GLAZIER. Then,\r\n     turning about, he floated down the constantly growing stream until\r\n     its mighty volume was emptied into the Gulf of Mexico. Of this\r\n     great trip, replete with adventure and abounding in incident, he\r\n     has given a most graphic and interesting account under the title of\r\n     'Down the Great River.'\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                      _The Wheeling Intelligencer._\r\n\r\n     \"Captain Glazier's name is familiar to the reading public of\r\n     America through his earlier works, 'Soldiers of the Saddle,'\r\n     'Capture, Prison-Pen and Escape,' 'Battles for the Union,' 'Heroes\r\n     of Three Wars,' 'Peculiarities of American Cities,' and 'Ocean to\r\n     Ocean on Horseback.' His latest book, 'Down the Great River,' is\r\n     his most important essay in the field of literature, and is in\r\n     several respects unique. It is a very interesting account of a\r\n     remarkable canoe voyage from the head waters of the Mississippi to\r\n     the Gulf; but its importance comes from the fact that, until this\r\n     voyage was made, the source of the Mississippi was universally\r\n     placed in Lake Itasca, whereas Glazier and his party demonstrated\r\n     that a higher basin, now put down in all the new maps and\r\n     geographies as LAKE GLAZIER, is really the primary reservoir of the\r\n     Mississippi. It seems almost incredible, but is nevertheless true,\r\n     that for over forty years previous to 1881, when Captain Glazier\r\n     made his discovery, it was accepted as settled that Lake Itasca was\r\n     the remotest body of water from the mouth of the Mississippi. The\r\n     falsity of this theory, however, has been established and an\r\n     important discovery given to the geographical world.

The testimony is of such a\r\ncharacter that it is impossible for an impartial critic to arrive at any\r\nother verdict than that the fountain-head of the Father of Waters is\r\n_not_ in Lake Itasca, but in the lake to the south of it, now known as\r\nLAKE GLAZIER. The declarations of the Indians and pioneers in the\r\nvicinity of the source of this river are altogether corroborative of\r\nCaptain Glazier and his companions; the press of Minnesota speaks with\r\nbut one voice, while geographers and educational publishers are almost\r\nunanimous in their recognition of the facts developed by his expedition.\r\n\r\n                                                 HUBBARD BROTHERS,\r\n                                 _Publishers of \"Down The Great River_.\"\r\n  723 Chestnut Street,\r\n Philadelphia, April 30, 1888.",
