The reader\r\n    flies in his express train in a few minutes through a couple\r\n    of centuries. The centuries pass more slowly to those to\r\n    whom the years are doled out day by day. Institutions grow\r\n    and beneficently develop themselves, making their way into\r\n    the hearts of generations which are shorter-lived than they,\r\n    attracting love and respect, and winning loyal obedience;\r\n    and then as gradually forfeiting by their shortcomings\r\n    the allegiance which had been honorably gained in worthier\r\n    periods. We see wealth and greatness; we see corruption and\r\n    vice; and one seems to follow so close upon the other, that we\r\n    fancy they must have always co-existed. We look more steadily,\r\n    and we perceive long periods of time, in which there is first\r\n    a growth and then a decay, like what we perceive in a tree\r\n    of the forest.\"\r\n\r\n    FROUDE, _Annals of an English Abbey_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMonasticism's record in the Philippines presents no new general fact\r\nto the eye of history. The attempt to eliminate the eternal feminine\r\nfrom her natural and normal sphere in the scheme of things there met\r\nwith the same certain and signal disaster that awaits every perversion\r\nof human activity. Beginning with a band of zealous, earnest men,\r\nsincere in their convictions, to whom the cause was all and their\r\npersonalities nothing, it there, as elsewhere, passed through its\r\nusual cycle of usefulness, stagnation, corruption, and degeneration.\r\n\r\nTo the unselfish and heroic efforts of the early friars Spain\r\nin large measure owed her dominion over the Philippine Islands\r\nand the Filipinos a marked advance on the road to civilization and\r\nnationality. In fact, after the dreams of sudden wealth from gold and\r\nspices had faded, the islands were retained chiefly as a missionary\r\nconquest and a stepping-stone to the broader fields of Asia, with\r\nManila as a depot for the Oriental trade. The records of those early\r\nyears are filled with tales of courage and heroism worthy of Spain's\r\nproudest years, as the missionary fathers labored with unflagging\r\nzeal in disinterested endeavor for the spread of the Faith and the\r\nbetterment of the condition of the Malays among whom they found\r\nthemselves. They won the confidence of the native peoples, gathered\r\nthem into settlements and villages, led them into the ways of peace,\r\nand became their protectors, guides, and counselors.\r\n\r\nIn those times the cross and the sword went hand in hand, but in the\r\nPhilippines the latter was rarely needed or used. The lightness and\r\nvivacity of the Spanish character, with its strain of Orientalism,\r\nits fertility of resource in meeting new conditions, its adaptability\r\nin dealing with the dwellers in warmer lands, all played their part in\r\nthis as in the other conquests. Only on occasions when some stubborn\r\nresistance was met with, as in Manila and the surrounding country,\r\nwhere the most advanced of the native peoples dwelt and where some of\r\nthe forms and beliefs of Islam had been established, was it necessary\r\nto resort to violence to destroy the native leaders and replace them\r\nwith the missionary fathers. A few sallies by young Salcedo, the Cortez\r\nof the Philippine conquest, with a company of the splendid infantry,\r\nwhich was at that time the admiration and despair of martial Europe,\r\nsoon effectively exorcised any idea of resistance that even the boldest\r\nand most intransigent of the native leaders might have entertained.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, no great persuasion was needed to turn a simple,\r\nimaginative, fatalistic people from a few vague animistic deities\r\nto the systematic iconology and the elaborate ritual of the Spanish\r\nChurch. An obscure _Bathala_ or a dim _Malyari_ was easily superseded\r\nby or transformed into a clearly defined _Diós_, and in the case of\r\nany especially tenacious \"demon,\" he could without much difficulty\r\nbe merged into a Christian saint or devil. There was no organized\r\npriesthood to be overcome, the primitive religious observances\r\nconsisting almost entirely of occasional orgies presided over by\r\nan old woman, who filled the priestly offices of interpreter for\r\nthe unseen powers and chief eater at the sacrificial feast. With\r\ntheir unflagging zeal, their organization, their elaborate forms\r\nand ceremonies, the missionaries were enabled to win the confidence\r\nof the natives, especially as the greater part of them learned the\r\nlocal language and identified their lives with the communities under\r\ntheir care. Accordingly, the people took kindly to their new teachers\r\nand rulers, so that in less than a generation Spanish authority was\r\ngenerally recognized in the settled portions of the Philippines,\r\nand in the succeeding years the missionaries gradually extended this\r\narea by forming settlements from among the wilder peoples, whom they\r\npersuaded to abandon the more objectionable features of their old\r\nroving, often predatory, life and to group themselves into towns and\r\nvillages \"under the bell.\"\r\n\r\nThe tactics employed in the conquest and the subsequent behavior of\r\nthe conquerors were true to the old Spanish nature, so succinctly\r\ncharacterized by a plain-spoken Englishman of Mary's reign, when the\r\nwar-cry of Castile encircled the globe and even hovered ominously\r\nnear the \"sceptered isle,\" when in the intoxication of power character\r\nstands out so sharply defined: \"They be verye wyse and politicke, and\r\ncan, thorowe ther wysdome, reform and brydell theyr owne natures for\r\na tyme, and applye ther conditions to the manners of those men with\r\nwhom they meddell gladlye by friendshippe; whose mischievous maners\r\na man shall never know untyll he come under ther subjection; but then\r\nshall he parfectlye parceve and fele them: for in dissimulations untyll\r\nthey have ther purposes, and afterwards in oppression and tyrannye,\r\nwhen they can obtain them, they do exceed all other nations upon the\r\nearthe.\" [1]\r\n\r\nIn the working out of this spirit, with all the indomitable courage\r\nand fanatical ardor derived from the long contests with the Moors,\r\nthey reduced the native peoples to submission, but still not to the\r\ngalling yoke which they fastened upon the aborigines of America, to\r\nmake one Las Casas shine amid the horde of Pizarros. There was some\r\ncompulsory labor in timber-cutting and ship-building, with enforced\r\nmilitary service as rowers and soldiers for expeditions to the Moluccas\r\nand the coasts of Asia, but nowhere the unspeakable atrocities which\r\nin Mexico, Hispaniola, and South America drove mothers to strangle\r\ntheir babes at birth and whole tribes to prefer self-immolation to the\r\nliving death in the mines and slave-pens. Quite differently from the\r\ncase in America, where entire islands and districts were depopulated,\r\nto bring on later the curse of negro slavery, in the Philippines\r\nthe fact appears that the native population really increased and\r\nthe standard of living was raised under the stern, yet beneficent,\r\ntutelage of the missionary fathers. The great distance and the\r\nhardships of the journey precluded the coming of many irresponsible\r\nadventurers from Spain and, fortunately for the native population,\r\nno great mineral wealth was ever discovered in the Philippine Islands.\r\n\r\nThe system of government was, in its essential features, a simple\r\none. The missionary priests drew the inhabitants of the towns\r\nand villages about themselves or formed new settlements, and with\r\nprofuse use of symbol and symbolism taught the people the Faith,\r\nlaying particular stress upon \"the fear of God,\" as administered by\r\nthem, reconciling the people to their subjection by inculcating the\r\nChristian virtues of patience and humility. When any recalcitrants\r\nrefused to accept the new order, or later showed an inclination to\r\nbreak away from it, the military forces, acting usually under secret\r\ndirections from the padre, made raids in the disaffected parts with\r\nall the unpitying atrocity the Spanish soldiery were ever capable of\r\ndisplaying in their dealings with a weaker people. After sufficient\r\npunishment had been inflicted and a wholesome fear inspired, the padre\r\nvery opportunely interfered in the natives' behalf, by which means\r\nthey were convinced that peace and security lay in submission to the\r\nauthorities, especially to the curate of their town or district. A\r\nsingle example will suffice to make the method clear: not an isolated\r\ninstance but a typical case chosen from among the mass of records\r\nleft by the chief actors themselves.\r\n\r\nFray Domingo Perez, evidently a man of courage and conviction, for he\r\nlater lost his life in the work of which he wrote, was the Dominican\r\nvicar on the Zambales coast when that Order temporarily took over the\r\ndistrict from the Recollects. In a report written for his superior in\r\n1680 he outlines the method clearly: \"In order that those whom we have\r\nassembled in the three villages may persevere in their settlements,\r\nthe most efficacious fear and the one most suited to their nature is\r\nthat the Spaniards of the fort and presidio of Paynaven [2] of whom\r\nthey have a very great fear, may come very often to the said villages\r\nand overrun the land, and penetrate even into their old recesses where\r\nthey formerly lived; and if perchance they should find anything planted\r\nin the said recesses that they would destroy it and cut it down without\r\nleaving them anything. And so that they may see the father protects\r\nthem, when the said Spaniards come to the village, the father opposes\r\nthem and takes the part of the Indians. But it is always necessary\r\nin this matter for the soldiers to conquer, and the father is always\r\nvery careful always to inform the Spaniards by whom and where anything\r\nis planted which it may be necessary to destroy, and that the edicts\r\nwhich his Lordship, the governor, sent them be carried out .... But\r\nat all events said Spaniards are to make no trouble for the Indians\r\nwhom they find in the villages, but rather must treat them well.\" [3]\r\n\r\nThis in 1680: the Dominican transcriber of the record in 1906 has\r\nadded a very illuminating note, revealing the immutability of the\r\nsystem and showing that the rulers possessed in a superlative degree\r\nthe Bourbonesque trait of learning nothing and forgetting nothing:\r\n\"Even when I was a missionary to the heathens from 1882 to 1892,\r\nI had occasion to observe the said policy, to inform the chief of\r\nthe fortress of the measures that he ought to take, and to make a\r\nfalse show on the other side so that it might have no influence on\r\nthe fortress.\"\r\n\r\nThus it stands out in bold relief as a system built up and maintained\r\nby fraud and force, bound in the course of nature to last only as\r\nlong as the deception could be carried on and the repressive force\r\nkept up to sufficient strength. Its maintenance required that the\r\ndifferent sections be isolated from each other so that there could\r\nbe no growth toward a common understanding and coöperation, and its\r\npermanence depended upon keeping the people ignorant and contented with\r\ntheir lot, held under strict control by religious and political fear.\r\n\r\nYet it was a vast improvement over their old mode of life and their\r\ncondition was bettered as they grew up to such a system. Only with\r\nthe passing of the years and the increase of wealth and influence,\r\nthe ease and luxury invited by these, and the consequent corruption so\r\ninduced, with the insatiable longing ever for more wealth and greater\r\ninfluence, did the poison of greed and grasping power enter the system\r\nto work its insidious way into every part, slowly transforming the\r\nbeneficent institution of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries\r\ninto an incubus weighing upon all the activities of the people in\r\nthe nineteenth, an unyielding bar to the development of the country,\r\na hideous anachronism in these modern times.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered also that Spain, in the years following her\r\nbrilliant conquests of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, lost\r\nstrength and vigor through the corruption at home induced by the\r\nunearned wealth that flowed into the mother country from the colonies,\r\nand by the draining away of her best blood. Nor did her sons ever\r\ndevelop that economic spirit which is the permanent foundation of\r\nall empire, but they let the wealth of the Indies flow through their\r\ncountry, principally to London and Amsterdam, there to form in more\r\npractical hands the basis of the British and Dutch colonial empires.\r\n\r\nThe priest and the soldier were supreme, so her best sons took up\r\neither the cross or the sword to maintain her dominion in the distant\r\ncolonies, a movement which, long continued, spelled for her a form of\r\nnational suicide. The soldier expended his strength and generally laid\r\ndown his life on alien soil, leaving no fit successor of his own stock\r\nto carry on the work according to his standards. The priest under the\r\ncelibate system, in its better days left no offspring at all and in\r\nthe days of its corruption none bred and reared under the influences\r\nthat make for social and political progress. The dark chambers of the\r\nInquisition stifled all advance in thought, so the civilization and\r\nthe culture of Spain, as well as her political system, settled into\r\nrigid forms to await only the inevitable process of stagnation and\r\ndecay. In her proudest hour an old soldier, who had lost one of his\r\nhands fighting her battles against the Turk at Lepanto, employed the\r\nother in writing the masterpiece of her literature, which is really\r\na caricature of the nation.\r\n\r\nThere is much in the career of Spain that calls to mind the dazzling\r\nbeauty of her \"dark-glancing daughters,\" with its early bloom, its\r\nstartling--almost morbid--brilliance, and its premature decay. Rapid\r\nand brilliant was her rise, gradual and inglorious her steady decline,\r\nfrom the bright morning when the banners of Castile and Aragon were\r\nflung triumphantly from the battlements of the Alhambra, to the short\r\nsummer, not so long gone, when at Cavite and Santiago with swift,\r\ndecisive havoc the last ragged remnants of the once world-dominating\r\npower were blown into space and time, to hover disembodied there, a\r\nlesson and a warning to future generations. Whatever her final place in\r\nthe records of mankind, whether as the pioneer of modern civilization\r\nor the buccaneer of the nations or, as would seem most likely, a\r\ngoodly mixture of both, she has at least--with the exception only\r\nof her great mother, Rome--furnished the most instructive lessons in\r\npolitical pathology yet recorded, and the advice to students of world\r\nprogress to familiarize themselves with her history is even more apt\r\ntoday than when it first issued from the encyclopedic mind of Macaulay\r\nnearly a century ago. Hardly had she reached the zenith of her power\r\nwhen the disintegration began, and one by one her brilliant conquests\r\ndropped away, to leave her alone in her faded splendor, with naught but\r\nher vaunting pride left, another \"Niobe of nations.\" In the countries\r\nmore in contact with the trend of civilization and more susceptible\r\nto revolutionary influences from the mother country this separation\r\ncame from within, while in the remoter parts the archaic and outgrown\r\nsystem dragged along until a stronger force from without destroyed it.\r\n\r\nNowhere was the crystallization of form and principle more pronounced\r\nthan in religious life, which fastened upon the mother country a\r\ndeadening weight that hampered all progress, and in the colonies,\r\nnotably in the Philippines, virtually converted her government into\r\na hagiarchy that had its face toward the past and either could not\r\nor would not move with the current of the times. So, when \"the shot\r\nheard round the world,\" the declaration of humanity's right to be and\r\nto become, in its all-encircling sweep, reached the lands controlled\r\nby her it was coldly received and blindly rejected by the governing\r\npowers, and there was left only the slower, subtler, but none the\r\nless sure, process of working its way among the people to burst in\r\ntime in rebellion and the destruction of the conservative forces that\r\nwould repress it.\r\n\r\nIn the opening years of the nineteenth century the friar orders in the\r\nPhilippines had reached the apogee of their power and usefulness. Their\r\ninfluence was everywhere felt and acknowledged, while the country\r\nstill prospered under the effects of the vigorous and progressive\r\nadministrations of Anda and Vargas in the preceding century. Native\r\nlevies had fought loyally under Spanish leadership against Dutch\r\nand British invaders, or in suppressing local revolts among their\r\nown people, which were always due to some specific grievance, never\r\ndirected definitely against the Spanish sovereignty. The Philippines\r\nwere shut off from contact with any country but Spain, and even this\r\ncommunication was restricted and carefully guarded. There was an\r\nelaborate central government which, however, hardly touched the life\r\nof the native peoples, who were guided and governed by the parish\r\npriests, each town being in a way an independent entity.\r\n\r\nOf this halcyon period, just before the process of disintegration\r\nbegan, there has fortunately been left a record which may be\r\ncharacterized as the most notable Spanish literary production\r\nrelating to the Philippines, being the calm, sympathetic, judicial\r\naccount of one who had spent his manhood in the work there and who,\r\nfull of years and experience, sat down to tell the story of their\r\nlife. [4] In it there are no puerile whinings, no querulous curses\r\nthat tropical Malays do not order their lives as did the people of\r\nthe Spanish village where he may have been reared, no selfish laments\r\nof ingratitude over blessings unasked and only imperfectly understood\r\nby the natives, no fatuous self-deception as to the real conditions,\r\nbut a patient consideration of the difficulties encountered, the good\r\naccomplished, and the unavoidable evils incident to any human work. The\r\ncountry and the people, too, are described with the charming simplicity\r\nof the eyes that see clearly, the brain that ponders deeply, and the\r\nheart that beats sympathetically. Through all the pages of his account\r\nruns the quiet strain of peace and contentment, of satisfaction with\r\nthe existing order, for he had looked upon the creation and saw that\r\nit was good. There is \"neither haste, nor hate, nor anger,\" but the\r\ndeliberate recital of the facts warmed and illumined by the geniality\r\nof a soul to whom age and experience had brought, not a sour cynicism,\r\nbut the mellowing influence of a ripened philosophy. He was such\r\nan old man as may fondly be imagined walking through the streets of\r\nParañaque in stately benignity amid the fear and respect of the brown\r\npeople over whom he watched.\r\n\r\nBut in all his chronicle there is no suggestion of anything more to\r\nhope for, anything beyond. Beautiful as the picture is, it is that of\r\na system which had reached maturity: a condition of stagnation, not\r\nof growth. In less than a decade, the terrific convulsions in European\r\npolitics made themselves felt even in the remote Philippines, and then\r\nbegan the gradual drawing away of the people from their rulers--blind\r\ngropings and erratic wanderings at first, but nevertheless persistent\r\nand vigorous tendencies.\r\n\r\nThe first notable influence was the admission of representatives\r\nfor the Philippines into the Spanish Cortes under the revolutionary\r\ngovernments and the abolition of the trade monopoly with Mexico. The\r\nlast galleon reached Manila in 1815, and soon foreign commercial\r\ninterests were permitted, in a restricted way, to enter the\r\ncountry. Then with the separation of Mexico and the other American\r\ncolonies from Spain a more marked change was brought about in that\r\ndirect communication was established with the mother country, and\r\nthe absolutism of the hagiarchy first questioned by the numbers of\r\nPeninsular Spaniards who entered the islands to trade, some even\r\nto settle and rear families there. These also affected the native\r\npopulation in the larger centers by the spread of their ideas, which\r\nwere not always in conformity with those that for several centuries\r\nthe friars had been inculcating into their wards. Moreover, there\r\nwas a not-inconsiderable portion of the population, sprung from the\r\nfriars themselves, who were eager to adopt the customs and ideas of\r\nthe Spanish immigrants.\r\n\r\nThe suppression of many of the monasteries in Spain in 1835 caused\r\na large influx of the disestablished monks into the Philippines in\r\nsearch for a haven, and a home, thus bringing about a conflict with\r\nthe native clergy, who were displaced from their best holdings to\r\nprovide berths for the newcomers. At the same time, the increase of\r\neducation among the native priests brought the natural demand for\r\nmore equitable treatment by the Spanish friar, so insistent that it\r\neven broke out into open rebellion in 1843 on the part of a young\r\nTagalog who thought himself aggrieved in this respect.\r\n\r\nThus the struggle went on, with stagnation above and some growth below,\r\nso that the governors were ever getting further away from the governed,\r\nand for such a movement there is in the course of nature but one\r\ninevitable result, especially when outside influences are actively at\r\nwork penetrating the social system and making for better things. Among\r\nthese influences four cumulative ones may be noted: the spread of\r\njournalism, the introduction of steamships into the Philippines,\r\nthe return of the Jesuits, and the opening of the Suez Canal.\r\n\r\nThe printing-press entered the islands with the conquest, but its use\r\nhad been strictly confined to religious works until about the middle of\r\nthe past century, when there was a sudden awakening and within a few\r\nyears five journals were being published. In 1848 appeared the first\r\nregular newspaper of importance, _El Diario de Manila_, and about a\r\ndecade later the principal organ of the Spanish-Filipino population,\r\n_El Comercio_, which, with varying vicissitudes, has continued down\r\nto the present. While rigorously censored, both politically and\r\nreligiously, and accessible to only an infinitesimal portion of the\r\npeople, they still performed the service of letting a few rays of\r\nlight into the Cimmerian intellectual gloom of the time and place.\r\n\r\nWith the coming of steam navigation communication between the\r\ndifferent parts of the islands was facilitated and trade encouraged,\r\nwith all that such a change meant in the way of breaking up the old\r\nisolation and tending to a common understanding. Spanish power, too,\r\nwas for the moment more firmly established, and Moro piracy in Luzon\r\nand the Bisayan Islands, which had been so great a drawback to the\r\ndevelopment of the country, was forever ended.\r\n\r\nThe return of the Jesuits produced two general results tending to\r\ndissatisfaction with the existing order. To them was assigned the\r\nmissionary field of Mindanao, which meant the displacement of the\r\nRecollect Fathers in the missions there, and for these other berths\r\nhad to be found. Again the native clergy were the losers in that they\r\nhad to give up their best parishes in Luzon, especially around Manila\r\nand Cavite, so the breach was further widened and the soil sown with\r\ndiscontent. But more far-reaching than this immediate result was\r\nthe educational movement inaugurated by the Jesuits. The native,\r\nalready feeling the vague impulses from without and stirred by the\r\ngrowing restlessness of the times, here saw a new world open before\r\nhim. A considerable portion of the native population in the larger\r\ncenters, who had shared in the economic progress of the colony, were\r\nenabled to look beyond their daily needs and to afford their children\r\nan opportunity for study and advancement--a condition and a need met\r\nby the Jesuits for a time.\r\n\r\nWith the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 communication with the\r\nmother country became cheaper, quicker, surer, so that large numbers\r\nof Spaniards, many of them in sympathy with the republican movements\r\nat home, came to the Philippines in search of fortunes and generally\r\nleft half-caste families who had imbibed their ideas. Native boys\r\nwho had already felt the intoxication of such learning as the schools\r\nof Manila afforded them began to dream of greater wonders in Spain,\r\nnow that the journey was possible for them. So began the definite\r\nmovements that led directly to the disintegration of the friar régime.\r\n\r\nIn the same year occurred the revolution in the mother country,\r\nwhich had tired of the old corrupt despotism. Isabella II was driven\r\ninto exile and the country left to waver about uncertainly for several\r\nyears, passing through all the stages of government from red radicalism\r\nto absolute conservatism, finally adjusting itself to the middle course\r\nof constitutional monarchism. During the effervescent and ephemeral\r\nrepublic there was sent to the Philippines a governor who set to work\r\nto modify the old system and establish a government more in harmony\r\nwith modern ideas and more democratic in form. His changes were hailed\r\nwith delight by the growing class of Filipinos who were striving for\r\nmore consideration in their own country, and who, in their enthusiasm\r\nand the intoxication of the moment, perhaps became more radical than\r\nwas safe under the conditions--surely too radical for their religious\r\nguides watching and waiting behind the veil of the temple.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1872, an uprising occurred in the naval arsenal at Cavite,\r\nwith a Spanish non-commissioned officer as one of the leaders. From\r\nthe meager evidence now obtainable, this would seem to have been\r\npurely a local mutiny over the service questions of pay and treatment,\r\nbut in it the friars saw their opportunity. It was blazoned forth,\r\nwith all the wild panic that was to characterize the actions of the\r\ngoverning powers from that time on, as the premature outbreak of\r\na general insurrection under the leadership of the native clergy,\r\nand rigorous repressive measures were demanded. Three native\r\npriests, notable for their popularity among their own people, one an\r\noctogenarian and the other two young canons of the Manila Cathedral,\r\nwere summarily garroted, along with the renegade Spanish officer\r\nwho had participated in the mutiny. No record of any trial of these\r\npriests has ever been brought to light. The Archbishop, himself a\r\nsecular [5] clergyman, stoutly refused to degrade them from their\r\nholy office, and they wore their sacerdotal robes at the execution,\r\nwhich was conducted in a hurried, fearful manner. At the same time\r\na number of young Manilans who had taken conspicuous part in the\r\n\"liberal\" demonstrations were deported to the Ladrone Islands or to\r\nremote islands of the Philippine group itself.\r\n\r\nThis was the beginning of the end. Yet there immediately followed\r\nthe delusive calm which ever precedes the fatal outburst, lulling\r\nthose marked for destruction to a delusive security. The two decades\r\nfollowing were years of quiet, unobtrusive growth, during which\r\nthe Philippine Islands made the greatest economic progress in their\r\nhistory. But this in itself was preparing the final catastrophe, for\r\nif there be any fact well established in human experience it is that\r\nwith economic development the power of organized religion begins to\r\nwane--the rise of the merchant spells the decline of the priest. A\r\nsordid change, from masses and mysteries to sugar and shoes, this is\r\noften said to be, but it should be noted that the epochs of greatest\r\neconomic activity have been those during which the generality of\r\nmankind have lived fuller and freer lives, and above all that in such\r\neras the finest intellects and the grandest souls have been developed.\r\n\r\nNor does an institution that has been slowly growing for three\r\ncenturies, molding the very life and fiber of the people, disintegrate\r\nwithout a violent struggle, either in its own constitution or in the\r\nlife of the people trained under it. Not only the ecclesiastical but\r\nalso the social and political system of the country was controlled by\r\nthe religious orders, often silently and secretly, but none the less\r\neffectively. This is evident from the ceaseless conflict that went on\r\nbetween the religious orders and the Spanish political administrators,\r\nwho were at every turn thwarted in their efforts to keep the government\r\nabreast of the times.\r\n\r\nThe shock of the affair of 1872 had apparently stunned the Filipinos,\r\nbut it had at the same time brought them to the parting of the ways and\r\ninduced a vague feeling that there was something radically wrong, which\r\ncould only be righted by a closer union among themselves. They began\r\nto consider that their interests and those of the governing powers were\r\nnot the same. In these feelings of distrust toward the friars they were\r\nstimulated by the great numbers of immigrant Spaniards who were then\r\nentering the country, many of whom had taken part in the republican\r\nmovements at home and who, upon the restoration of the monarchy,\r\nno doubt thought it safer for them to be at as great a distance as\r\npossible from the throne. The young Filipinos studying in Spain came\r\nfrom different parts of the islands, and by their association there\r\nin a foreign land were learning to forget their narrow sectionalism;\r\nhence the way was being prepared for some concerted action. Thus,\r\naided and encouraged by the anti-clerical Spaniards in the mother\r\ncountry, there was growing up a new generation of native leaders,\r\nwho looked toward something better than the old system.\r\n\r\nIt is with this period in the history of the country--the author's\r\nboyhood--that the story of _Noli Me Tangere_ deals. Typical scenes and\r\ncharacters are sketched from life with wonderful accuracy, and the\r\npicture presented is that of a master-mind, who knew and loved his\r\nsubject. Terror and repression were the order of the day, with ever\r\na growing unrest in the higher circles, while the native population\r\nat large seemed to be completely _cowed_--\"brutalized\" is the term\r\nrepeatedly used by Rizal in his political essays. Spanish writers of\r\nthe period, observing only the superficial movements,--some of which\r\nwere indeed fantastical enough, for\r\n\r\n\r\n                                              \"they,\r\n    Who in oppression's darkness caved have dwelt,\r\n    They are not eagles, nourished with the day;\r\n    What marvel, then, at times, if they mistake their way?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n--and not heeding the currents at work below, take great delight in\r\nridiculing the pretensions of the young men seeking advancement,\r\nwhile they indulge in coarse ribaldry over the wretched condition\r\nof the great mass of the \"Indians.\" The author, however, himself a\r\n\"miserable Indian,\" vividly depicts the unnatural conditions and\r\ndominant characters produced under the outworn system of fraud and\r\nforce, at the same time presenting his people as living, feeling,\r\nstruggling individuals, with all the frailties of human nature and all\r\nthe possibilities of mankind, either for good or evil; incidentally\r\nhe throws into marked contrast the despicable depreciation used by\r\nthe Spanish writers in referring to the Filipinos, making clear the\r\napplication of the self-evident proposition that no ordinary human\r\nbeing in the presence of superior force can very well conduct himself\r\nas a man unless he be treated as such.\r\n\r\nThe friar orders, deluded by their transient triumph and secure in\r\ntheir pride of place, became more arrogant, more domineering than\r\never. In the general administration the political rulers were at every\r\nturn thwarted, their best efforts frustrated, and if they ventured\r\ntoo far their own security threatened; for in the three-cornered\r\nwrangle which lasted throughout the whole of the Spanish domination,\r\nthe friar orders had, in addition to the strength derived from their\r\norganization and their wealth, the Damoclean weapon of control over the\r\nnatives to hang above the heads of both governor and archbishop. The\r\ncurates in the towns, always the real rulers, became veritable despots,\r\nso that no voice dared to raise itself against them, even in the midst\r\nof conditions which the humblest _indio_ was beginning to feel dumbly\r\nto be perverted and unnatural, and that, too, after three centuries\r\nof training under the system that he had ever been taught to accept as\r\n\"the will of God.\"\r\n\r\nThe friars seemed long since to have forgotten those noble aims\r\nthat had meant so much to the founders and early workers of their\r\norders, if indeed the great majority of those of the later day had\r\never realized the meaning of their office, for the Spanish writers of\r\nthe time delight in characterizing them as the meanest of the Spanish\r\npeasantry, when not something worse, who had been \"lassoed,\" taught a\r\nfew ritualistic prayers, and shipped to the Philippines to be placed\r\nin isolated towns as lords and masters of the native population, with\r\nall the power and prestige over a docile people that the sacredness of\r\ntheir holy office gave them. These writers treat the matter lightly,\r\nseeing in it rather a huge joke on the \"miserable Indians,\" and\r\ngive the friars great credit for \"patriotism,\" a term which in this\r\nconnection they dragged from depth to depth until it quite aptly fitted\r\nDr. Johnson's famous definition, \"the last refuge of a scoundrel.\"\r\n\r\nIn their conduct the religious corporations, both as societies and as\r\nindividuals, must be estimated according to their own standards--the\r\napplication of any other criterion would be palpably unfair. They\r\nundertook to hold the native in subjection, to regulate the essential\r\nactivities of his life according to their ideas, so upon them\r\nmust fall the responsibility for the conditions finally attained:\r\nto destroy the freedom of the subject and then attempt to blame him\r\nfor his conduct is a paradox into which the learned men often fell,\r\nperhaps inadvertently through their deductive logic. They endeavored\r\nto shape the lives of their Malay wards not only in this existence\r\nbut also in the next. Their vows were poverty, chastity, and obedience.\r\n\r\nThe vow of poverty was early relegated to the limbo of neglect. Only a\r\nfew years after the founding of Manila royal decrees began to issue on\r\nthe subject of complaints received by the King over the usurpation of\r\nlands on the part of the priests. Using the same methods so familiar in\r\nthe heyday of the institution of monasticism in Europe--pious gifts,\r\ndeathbed bequests, pilgrims' offerings--the friar orders gradually\r\nsecured the richest of the arable lands in the more thickly settled\r\nportions of the Philippines, notably the part of Luzon occupied by\r\nthe Tagalogs. Not always, however, it must in justice be recorded,\r\nwere such doubtful means resorted to, for there were instances where\r\nthe missionary was the pioneer, gathering about himself a band of\r\ndevoted natives and plunging into the unsettled parts to build up\r\na town with its fields around it, which would later become a friar\r\nestate. With the accumulated incomes from these estates and the fees\r\nfor religious observances that poured into their treasuries, the\r\norders in their nature of perpetual corporations became the masters of\r\nthe situation, the lords of the country. But this condition was not\r\naltogether objectionable; it was in the excess of their greed that\r\nthey went astray, for the native peoples had been living under this\r\nsystem through generations and not until they began to feel that they\r\nwere not receiving fair treatment did they question the authority of\r\na power which not only secured them a peaceful existence in this life\r\nbut also assured them eternal felicity in the next.\r\n\r\nWith only the shining exceptions that are produced in any system, no\r\nmatter how false its premises or how decadent it may become, to uphold\r\nfaith in the intrinsic soundness of human nature, the vow of chastity\r\nwas never much more than a myth. Through the tremendous influence\r\nexerted over a fanatically religious people, who implicitly followed\r\nthe teachings of the reverend fathers, once their confidence had\r\nbeen secured, the curate was seldom to be gainsaid in his desires. By\r\nmeans of the secret influence in the confessional and the more open\r\npolitical power wielded by him, the fairest was his to command,\r\nand the favored one and her people looked upon the choice more as an\r\nhonor than otherwise, for besides the social standing that it gave her\r\nthere was the proud prospect of becoming the mother of children who\r\ncould claim kinship with the dominant race. The curate's \"companion\"\r\nor the sacristan's wife was a power in the community, her family was\r\nraised to a place of importance and influence among their own people,\r\nwhile she and her ecclesiastical offspring were well cared for. On\r\nthe death or removal of the curate, it was almost invariably found\r\nthat she had been provided with a husband or protector and a not\r\ninconsiderable amount of property--an arrangement rather appealing\r\nto a people among whom the means of living have ever been so insecure.\r\n\r\nThat this practise was not particularly offensive to the people among\r\nwhom they dwelt may explain the situation, but to claim that it excuses\r\nthe friars approaches dangerously close to casuistry. Still, as long as\r\nthis arrangement was decently and moderately carried out, there seems\r\nto have been no great objection, nor from a worldly point of view,\r\nwith all the conditions considered, could there be much. But the old\r\nstory of excess, of unbridled power turned toward bad ends, again\r\nrecurs, at the same time that the ideas brought in by the Spaniards\r\nwho came each year in increasing numbers and the principles observed\r\nby the young men studying in Europe cast doubt upon the fitness of\r\nsuch a state of affairs. As they approached their downfall, like all\r\nmankind, the friars became more open, more insolent, more shameless,\r\nin their conduct.\r\n\r\nThe story of Maria Clara, as told in _Noli Me Tangere_, is by no means\r\nan exaggerated instance, but rather one of the few clean enough to\r\nbear the light, and her fate, as depicted in the epilogue, is said\r\nto be based upon an actual occurrence with which the author must have\r\nbeen familiar.\r\n\r\nThe vow of obedience--whether considered as to the Pope, their\r\nhighest religious authority, or to the King of Spain, their political\r\nliege--might not always be so callously disregarded, but it could be\r\nevaded and defied. From the Vatican came bull after bull, from the\r\nEscorial decree after decree, only to be archived in Manila, sometimes\r\nafter a hollow pretense of compliance. A large part of the records of\r\nSpanish domination is taken up with the wearisome quarrels that went\r\non between the Archbishop, representing the head of the Church, and\r\nthe friar orders, over the questions of the episcopal visitation and\r\nthe enforcement of the provisions of the Council of Trent relegating\r\nthe monks to their original status of missionaries, with the friars\r\ninvariably victorious in their contentions. Royal decrees ordering\r\ninquiries into the titles to the estates of the men of poverty and\r\nthose providing for the education of the natives in Spanish were\r\nmerely sneered at and left to molder in harmless quiet. Not without\r\ngood grounds for his contention, the friar claimed that the Spanish\r\ndominion over the Philippines depended upon him, and he therefore\r\nconfidently set himself up as the best judge of how that dominion\r\nshould be maintained.\r\n\r\nThus there are presented in the Philippines of the closing quarter of\r\nthe century just past the phenomena so frequently met with in modern\r\nsocieties, so disheartening to the people who must drag out their lives\r\nunder them, of an old system which has outworn its usefulness and is\r\nbeing called into question, with forces actively at work disintegrating\r\nit, yet with the unhappy folk bred and reared under it unprepared for\r\na new order of things. The old faith was breaking down, its forms\r\nand beliefs, once so full of life and meaning, were being sharply\r\nexamined, doubt and suspicion were the order of the day. Moreover,\r\nit must ever be borne in mind that in the Philippines this unrest,\r\nexcept in the parts where the friars were the landlords, was not\r\ngeneral among the people, the masses of whom were still sunk in their\r\n\"loved Egyptian night,\" but affected only a very small proportion of\r\nthe population--for the most part young men who were groping their\r\nway toward something better, yet without any very clearly conceived\r\nidea of what that better might be, and among whom was to be found the\r\nusual sprinkling of \"sunshine patriots\" and omnipresent opportunists\r\nready for any kind of trouble that will afford them a chance to rise.\r\n\r\nAdd to the apathy of the masses dragging out their vacant lives amid\r\nthe shadows of religious superstition and to the unrest of the few,\r\nthe fact that the orders were in absolute control of the political\r\nmachinery of the country, with the best part of the agrarian wealth\r\namortized in their hands; add also the ever-present jealousies, petty\r\nfeuds, and racial hatreds, for which Manila and the Philippines,\r\nwith their medley of creeds and races, offer such a fertile field,\r\nall fostered by the governing class for the maintenance of the old\r\nMachiavelian principle of \"divide and rule,\" and the sum is about\r\nthe most miserable condition under which any portion of mankind ever\r\ntried to fulfill nature's inexorable laws of growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\n    And third came she who gives dark creeds their power,\r\n    Silabbat-paramasa, sorceress,\r\n    Draped fair in many lands as lowly Faith,\r\n    But ever juggling souls with rites and prayers;\r\n    The keeper of those keys which lock up Hells\r\n    And open Heavens. \"Wilt thou dare,\" she said,\r\n    \"Put by our sacred books, dethrone our gods,\r\n    Unpeople all the temples, shaking down\r\n    That law which feeds the priests and props the realm?\"\r\n    But Buddha answered, \"What thou bidd'st me keep\r\n    Is form which passes, but the free Truth stands;\r\n    Get thee unto thy darkness.\"\r\n\r\n                            SIR EDWIN ARNOLD, _The Light of Asia_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Ah, simple people, how little do you know the blessing that you\r\nenjoy! Neither hunger, nor nakedness, nor inclemency of the weather\r\ntroubles you. With the payment of seven reals per year, you remain free\r\nof contributions. You do not have to close your houses with bolts. You\r\ndo not fear that the district troopers will come in to lay waste your\r\nfields, and trample you under foot at your own firesides. You call\r\n'father' the one who is in command over you. Perhaps there will come\r\na time when you will be more civilized, and you will break out in\r\nrevolution; and you will wake terrified, at the tumult of the riots,\r\nand will see blood flowing through these quiet fields, and gallows\r\nand guillotines erected in these squares, which never yet have seen an\r\nexecution.\" [6] Thus moralized a Spanish traveler in 1842, just as that\r\n_dolce far niente_ was drawing to its close. Already far-seeing men had\r\nbegun to raise in the Spanish parliament the question of the future of\r\nthe Philippines, looking toward some definite program for their care\r\nunder modern conditions and for the adjustment of their relations with\r\nthe mother country. But these were mere Cassandra-voices--the horologe\r\nof time was striking for Rome's successor, as it did for Rome herself.\r\n\r\nJust where will come the outbreak after three centuries of\r\nmind-repression and soul-distortion, of forcing a growing subject\r\ninto the strait-jacket of medieval thought and action, of natural\r\nselection reversed by the constant elimination of native initiative and\r\nleadership, is indeed a curious study. That there will be an outbreak\r\nsomewhere is as certain as that the plant will grow toward the light,\r\neven under the most unfavorable conditions, for man's nature is but\r\nthe resultant of eternal forces that ceaselessly and irresistibly\r\ninterplay about and upon him, and somewhere this resultant will\r\nexpress itself in thought or deed.\r\n\r\nAfter three centuries of Spanish ecclesiastical domination in the\r\nPhilippines, it was to be expected that the wards would turn against\r\ntheir mentors the methods that had been used upon them, nor is it\r\nespecially remarkable that there was a decided tendency in some parts\r\nto revert to primitive barbarism, but that concurrently a creative\r\ngenius--a bard or seer--should have been developed among a people\r\nwho, as a whole, have hardly passed through the clan or village\r\nstage of society, can be regarded as little less than a psychological\r\nphenomenon, and provokes the perhaps presumptuous inquiry as to whether\r\nthere may not be some things about our common human nature that the\r\nlearned doctors have not yet included in their anthropometric diagrams.\r\n\r\nOn the western shore of the Lake of Bay in the heart of the Philippines\r\nclusters the village of Kalamba, first established by the Jesuit\r\nFathers in the early days of the conquest, and upon their expulsion\r\nin 1767 taken over by the Crown, which later transferred it to the\r\nDominicans, under whose care the fertile fields about it became one\r\nof the richest of the friar estates. It can hardly be called a town,\r\neven for the Philippines, but is rather a market-village, set as it\r\nis at the outlet of the rich country of northern Batangas on the\r\nopen waterway to Manila and the outside world. Around it flourish\r\nthe green rice-fields, while Mount Makiling towers majestically near\r\nin her moods of cloud and sunshine, overlooking the picturesque\r\ncurve of the shore and the rippling waters of the lake. Shadowy\r\nto the eastward gleam the purple crests of Banahao and Cristobal,\r\nand but a few miles to the southwestward dim-thundering, seething,\r\nearth-rocking Taal mutters and moans of the world's birth-throes. It\r\nis the center of a region rich in native lore and legend, as it sleeps\r\nthrough the dusty noons when the cacao leaves droop with the heat and\r\ndreams through the silvery nights, waking twice or thrice a week to\r\nthe endless babble and ceaseless chatter of an Oriental market where\r\nthe noisy throngs make of their trading as much a matter of pleasure\r\nand recreation as of business.\r\n\r\nDirectly opposite this market-place, in a house facing the village\r\nchurch, there was born in 1861 into the already large family of one\r\nof the more prosperous tenants on the Dominican estate a boy who was\r\nto combine in his person the finest traits of the Oriental character\r\nwith the best that Spanish and European culture could add, on whom\r\nwould fall the burden of his people's woes to lead him over the _via\r\ndolorosa_ of struggle and sacrifice, ending in his own destruction\r\namid the crumbling ruins of the system whose disintegration he himself\r\nhad done so much to compass.\r\n\r\nJosé Rizal-Mercado y Alonso, as his name emerges from the confusion\r\nof Filipino nomenclature, was of Malay extraction, with some distant\r\nstrains of Spanish and Chinese blood. His genealogy reveals several\r\npersons remarkable for intellect and independence of character, notably\r\na Philippine Eloise and Abelard, who, drawn together by their common\r\nenthusiasm for study and learning, became his maternal grandparents, as\r\nwell as a great-uncle who was a traveler and student and who directed\r\nthe boy's early studies. Thus from the beginning his training was\r\nexceptional, while his mind was stirred by the trouble already brewing\r\nin his community, and from the earliest hours of consciousness he saw\r\nabout him the wrongs and injustices which overgrown power will ever\r\ndevelop in dealing with a weaker subject. One fact of his childhood,\r\ntoo, stands out clearly, well worthy of record: his mother seems to\r\nhave been a woman of more than ordinary education for the time and\r\nplace, and, pleased with the boy's quick intelligence, she taught him\r\nto read Spanish from a copy of the Vulgate in that language, which\r\nshe had somehow managed to secure and keep in her possession--the\r\nold, old story of the Woman and the Book, repeated often enough under\r\nstrange circumstances, but under none stranger than these. The boy's\r\nfather was well-to-do, so he was sent at the age of eight to study\r\nin the new Jesuit school in Manila, not however before he had already\r\ninspired some awe in his simple neighbors by the facility with which\r\nhe composed verses in his native tongue.\r\n\r\nHe began his studies in a private house while waiting for an\r\nopportunity to enter the Ateneo, as the Jesuit school is called,\r\nand while there he saw one of his tutors, Padre Burgos, haled to\r\nan ignominious death on the garrote as a result of the affair of\r\n1872. This made a deep impression on his childish mind and, in fact,\r\nseems to have been one of the principal factors in molding his ideas\r\nand shaping his career. That the effect upon him was lasting and that\r\nhis later judgment confirmed him in the belief that a great injustice\r\nhad been done, are shown by the fact that his second important work,\r\n_El Filibusterismo_, written about 1891, and miscalled by himself a\r\n\"novel,\" for it is really a series of word-paintings constituting a\r\nterrific arraignment of the whole régime, was dedicated to the three\r\npriests executed in 1872, in these words: \"Religion, in refusing\r\nto degrade you, has placed in doubt the crime imputed to you; the\r\ngovernment, in surrounding your case with mystery and shadow, gives\r\nreason for belief in some error, committed in fatal moments; and all\r\nthe Philippines, in venerating your memory and calling you martyrs,\r\nin no way acknowledges your guilt.\" The only answer he ever received\r\nto this was eight Remington bullets fired into his back.\r\n\r\nIn the Ateneo he quickly attracted attention and became a general\r\nfavorite by his application to his studies, the poetic fervor with\r\nwhich he entered into all the exercises of religious devotion, and\r\nthe gentleness of his character. He was from the first considered\r\n\"peculiar,\" for so the common mind regards everything that fails to fit\r\nthe old formulas, being of a rather dreamy and reticent disposition,\r\nmore inclined to reading Spanish romances than joining in the games of\r\nhis schoolmates. And of all the literatures that could be placed in\r\nthe hands of an imaginative child, what one would be more productive\r\nin a receptive mind of a fervid love of life and home and country and\r\nall that men hold dear, than that of the musical language of Castile,\r\nwith its high coloring and passionate character?\r\n\r\nHis activities were varied, for, in addition to his regular studies,\r\nhe demonstrated considerable skill in wood-carving and wax-modeling,\r\nand during this period won several prizes for poetical compositions\r\nin Spanish, which, while sometimes juvenile in form and following\r\nclosely after Spanish models, reveal at times flashes of thought and\r\nturns of expression that show distinct originality; even in these\r\nearly compositions there is that plaintive undertone, that minor\r\nchord of sadness, which pervades all his poems, reaching its fullest\r\nmeasure of pathos in the verses written in his death-cell. He received\r\na bachelor's degree according to the Spanish system in 1877, but\r\ncontinued advanced studies in agriculture at the Ateneo, at the same\r\ntime that he was pursuing the course in philosophy in the Dominican\r\nUniversity of Santo Tomas, where in 1879 he startled the learned\r\ndoctors by a reference in a prize poem to the Philippines as his\r\n\"patria,\" fatherland. This political heresy on the part of a native\r\nof the islands was given no very serious attention at the time, being\r\nlooked upon as the vagary of a schoolboy, but again in the following\r\nyear, by what seems a strange fatality, he stirred the resentment of\r\nthe friars, especially the Dominicans, by winning over some of their\r\nnumber the first prize in a literary contest celebrated in honor of\r\nthe author of _Don Quixote_.\r\n\r\nThe archaic instruction in Santo Tomas soon disgusted him and led to\r\ndisagreements with the instructors, and he turned to Spain. Plans\r\nfor his journey and his stay there had to be made with the utmost\r\ncaution, for it would hardly have fared well with his family had\r\nit become known that the son of a tenant on an estate which was a\r\npart of the University endowment was studying in Europe. He reached\r\nSpanish territory first in Barcelona, the hotbed of radicalism,\r\nwhere he heard a good deal of revolutionary talk, which, however,\r\nseems to have made but little impression upon him, for throughout\r\nhis entire career breadth of thought and strength of character are\r\nrevealed in his consistent opposition to all forms of violence.\r\n\r\nIn Madrid he pursued the courses in medicine and philosophy, but a\r\nfact of even more consequence than his proficiency in his regular\r\nwork was his persistent study of languages and his omnivorous\r\nreading. He was associated with the other Filipinos who were working\r\nin a somewhat spectacular way, misdirected rather than led by what\r\nmay be styled the Spanish liberals, for more considerate treatment of\r\nthe Philippines. But while he was among them he was not of them, as\r\nhis studious habits and reticent disposition would hardly have made\r\nhim a favorite among those who were enjoying the broader and gayer\r\nlife there. Moreover, he soon advanced far beyond them in thought by\r\nrealizing that they were beginning at the wrong end of the labor,\r\nfor even at that time he seems to have caught, by what must almost\r\nbe looked upon as an inspiration of genius, since there was nothing\r\napparent in his training that would have suggested it, the realization\r\nof the fact that hope for his people lay in bettering their condition,\r\nthat any real benefit must begin with the benighted folk at home,\r\nthat the introduction of reforms for which they were unprepared would\r\nbe useless, even dangerous to them. This was not at all the popular\r\nidea among his associates and led to serious disagreements with their\r\nleaders, for it was the way of toil and sacrifice without any of the\r\nexcitement and glamour that came from drawing up magnificent plans\r\nand sending them back home with appeals for funds to carry on the\r\npropaganda--for the most part banquets and entertainments to Spain's\r\npolitical leaders.\r\n\r\nHis views, as revealed in his purely political writings, may be\r\nsuccinctly stated, for he had that faculty of expression which never\r\nleaves any room for doubt as to the meaning. His people had a natural\r\nright to grow and to develop, and any obstacles to such growth and\r\ndevelopment were to be removed. He realized that the masses of his\r\ncountrymen were sunk deep in poverty and ignorance, cringing and\r\ncrouching before political authority, crawling and groveling before\r\nreligious superstition, but to him this was no subject for jest\r\nor indifferent neglect--it was a serious condition which should be\r\nameliorated, and hope lay in working into the inert social mass the\r\nleaven of conscious individual effort toward the development of a\r\ndistinctive, responsible personality. He was profoundly appreciative\r\nof all the good that Spain had done, but saw in this no inconsistency\r\nwith the desire that this gratitude might be given cause to be ever\r\non the increase, thereby uniting the Philippines with the mother\r\ncountry by the firm bonds of common ideas and interests, for his\r\nearlier writings breathe nothing but admiration, respect, and loyalty\r\nfor Spain and her more advanced institutions. The issue was clear to\r\nhim and he tried to keep it so.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed administrative myopia, induced largely by blind greed,\r\nwhich allowed the friar orders to confuse the objections to their\r\nrepressive system with an attack upon Spanish sovereignty, thereby\r\ndragging matters from bad to worse, to engender ill feeling and finally\r\ndesperation. This narrow, selfish policy had about as much soundness\r\nin it as the idea upon which it was based, so often brought forward\r\nwith what looks very suspiciously like a specious effort to cover\r\nmental indolence with a glittering generality, \"that the Filipino is\r\nonly a grown-up child and needs a strong paternal government,\" an idea\r\nwhich entirely overlooks the natural fact that when an impressionable\r\nsubject comes within the influence of a stronger force from a higher\r\ncivilization he is very likely to remain a child--perhaps a stunted\r\none--as long as he is treated as such. There is about as much sense\r\nand justice in such logic as there would be in that of keeping a babe\r\nconfined in swaddling-bands and then blaming it for not knowing how to\r\nwalk. No creature will remain a healthy child forever, but, as Spain\r\nlearned to her bitter cost, will be very prone, as the parent grows\r\ndecrepit and it begins to feel its strength, to prove a troublesome\r\nsubject to handle, thereby reversing the natural law suggested by the\r\ncomparison, and bringing such Sancho-Panza statecraft to flounder at\r\nlast through as hopeless confusion to as absurd a conclusion as his\r\nown island government.\r\n\r\nRizal was not one of those rabid, self-seeking revolutionists who\r\nwould merely overthrow the government and maintain the old system\r\nwith themselves in the privileged places of the former rulers, nor\r\nis he to be classed among the misguided enthusiasts who by their\r\nintemperate demands and immoderate conduct merely strengthen the\r\nhands of those in power. He realized fully that the restrictions\r\nunder which the people had become accustomed to order their lives\r\nshould be removed gradually as they advanced under suitable guidance\r\nand became capable of adjusting themselves to the new and better\r\nconditions. They should take all the good offered, from any source,\r\nespecially that suited to their nature, which they could properly\r\nassimilate. No great patience was ever exhibited by him toward those\r\nof his countrymen--the most repulsive characters in his stories are\r\nsuch--who would make of themselves mere apes and mimes, decorating\r\nthemselves with a veneer of questionable alien characteristics, but\r\nwith no personality or stability of their own, presenting at best\r\na spectacle to make devils laugh and angels weep, lacking even the\r\nhothouse product's virtue of being good to look upon.\r\n\r\nReduced to a definite form, the wish of the more thoughtful in the\r\nnew generation of Filipino leaders that was growing up was that the\r\nPhilippine Islands be made a province of Spain with representation in\r\nthe Cortes and the concomitant freedom of expression and criticism. All\r\nthat was directly asked was some substantial participation in the\r\nmanagement of local affairs, and the curtailment of the arbitrary power\r\nof petty officials, especially of the friar curates, who constituted\r\nthe chief obstacle to the education and development of the people.\r\n\r\nThe friar orders were, however, all-powerful, not only in the\r\nPhilippines, but also in Madrid, where they were not chary of making\r\nuse of a part of their wealth to maintain their influence. The\r\nefforts of the Filipinos in Spain, while closely watched, do not\r\nseem to have been given any very serious attention, for the Spanish\r\nauthorities no doubt realized that as long as the young men stayed\r\nin Madrid writing manifestoes in a language which less than one\r\nper cent of their countrymen could read and spending their money\r\non members of the Cortes, there could be little danger of trouble\r\nin the Philippines. Moreover, the Spanish ministers themselves\r\nappear to have been in sympathy with the more moderate wishes of\r\nthe Filipinos, a fact indicated by the number of changes ordered\r\nfrom time to time in the Philippine administration, but they were\r\npowerless before the strength and local influence of the religious\r\norders. So matters dragged their weary way along until there was an\r\nunexpected and startling development, a David-Goliath contest, and\r\ncertainly no one but a genius could have polished the \"smooth stone\"\r\nthat was to smite the giant.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the idea of writing a novel depicting conditions in\r\nhis native land first came to Rizal from a perusal of Eugene Sue's\r\n_The Wandering Jew_, while he was a student in Madrid, although the\r\nmodel for the greater part of it is plainly the delectable sketches\r\nin _Don Quixote_, for the author himself possessed in a remarkable\r\ndegree that Cervantic touch which raises the commonplace, even the\r\nmean, into the highest regions of art. Not, however, until he had\r\nspent some time in Paris continuing his medical studies, and later in\r\nGermany, did anything definite result. But in 1887 _Noli Me Tangere_\r\nwas printed in Berlin, in an establishment where the author is said\r\nto have worked part of his time as a compositor in order to defray\r\nhis expenses while he continued his studies. A limited edition was\r\npublished through the financial aid extended by a Filipino associate,\r\nand sent to Hongkong, thence to be surreptitiously introduced into\r\nthe Philippines.\r\n\r\n_Noli Me Tangere_ (\"Touch Me Not\") at the time the work was written had\r\na peculiar fitness as a title. Not only was there an apt suggestion\r\nof a comparison with the common flower of that name, but the term\r\nis also applied in pathology to a malignant cancer which affects\r\nevery bone and tissue in the body, and that this latter was in the\r\nauthor's mind would appear from the dedication and from the summing-up\r\nof the Philippine situation in the final conversation between Ibarra\r\nand Elias. But in a letter written to a friend in Paris at the time,\r\nthe author himself says that it was taken from the Gospel scene where\r\nthe risen Savior appears to the Magdalene, to whom He addresses these\r\nwords, a scene that has been the subject of several notable paintings.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it is interesting to note what he himself thought of\r\nthe work, and his frank statement of what he had tried to accomplish,\r\nmade just as he was publishing it: \"_Noli Me Tangere_, an expression\r\ntaken from the Gospel of St. Luke, [7] means _touch me not_. The\r\nbook contains things of which no one up to the present time has\r\nspoken, for they are so sensitive that they have never suffered\r\nthemselves to be touched by any one whomsoever. For my own part, I\r\nhave attempted to do what no one else has been willing to do: I have\r\ndared to answer the calumnies that have for centuries been heaped\r\nupon us and our country. I have written of the social condition and\r\nthe life, of our beliefs, our hopes, our longings, our complaints,\r\nand our sorrows; I have unmasked the hypocrisy which, under the cloak\r\nof religion, has come among us to impoverish and to brutalize us,\r\nI have distinguished the true religion from the false, from the\r\nsuperstition that traffics with the holy word to get money and to\r\nmake us believe in absurdities for which Catholicism would blush,\r\nif ever it knew of them. I have unveiled that which has been hidden\r\nbehind the deceptive and dazzling words of our governments. I have\r\ntold our countrymen of our mistakes, our vices, our faults, and our\r\nweak complaisance with our miseries there. Where I have found virtue I\r\nhave spoken of it highly in order to render it homage; and if I have\r\nnot wept in speaking of our misfortunes, I have laughed over them,\r\nfor no one would wish to weep with me over our woes, and laughter\r\nis ever the best means of concealing sorrow. The deeds that I have\r\nrelated are true and have actually occurred; I can furnish proof of\r\nthis. My book may have (and it does have) defects from an artistic\r\nand esthetic point of view--this I do not deny--but no one can dispute\r\nthe veracity of the facts presented.\" [8]\r\n\r\nBut while the primary purpose and first effect of the work was to\r\ncrystallize anti-friar sentiment, the author has risen above a mere\r\npersonal attack, which would give it only a temporary value, and by\r\nportraying in so clear and sympathetic a way the life of his people\r\nhas produced a piece of real literature, of especial interest now as\r\nthey are being swept into the newer day. Any fool can point out errors\r\nand defects, if they are at all apparent, and the persistent searching\r\nthem out for their own sake is the surest mark of the vulpine mind,\r\nbut the author has east aside all such petty considerations and,\r\nwhether consciously or not, has left a work of permanent value to\r\nhis own people and of interest to all friends of humanity. If ever a\r\nfair land has been cursed with the wearisome breed of fault-finders,\r\nboth indigenous and exotic, that land is the Philippines, so it is\r\nindeed refreshing to turn from the dreary waste of carping criticisms,\r\npragmatical \"scientific\" analyses, and sneering half-truths to a story\r\npulsating with life, presenting the Filipino as a human being, with\r\nhis virtues and his vices, his loves and hates, his hopes and fears.\r\n\r\nThe publication of _Noli Me Tangere_ suggests the reflection that\r\nthe story of Achilles' heel is a myth only in form. The belief that\r\nany institution, system, organization, or arrangement has reached\r\nan absolute form is about as far as human folly can go. The friar\r\norders looked upon themselves as the sum of human achievement in\r\nman-driving and God-persuading, divinely appointed to rule, fixed\r\nin their power, far above suspicion. Yet they were obsessed by the\r\nsensitive, covert dread of exposure that ever lurks spectrally under\r\npharisaism's specious robe, so when there appeared this work of a\r\n\"miserable Indian,\" who dared to portray them and the conditions\r\nthat their control produced exactly as they were--for the indefinable\r\ntouch by which the author gives an air of unimpeachable veracity to\r\nhis story is perhaps its greatest artistic merit--the effect upon the\r\nmercurial Spanish temperament was, to say the least, electric. The\r\nvery audacity of the thing left the friars breathless.\r\n\r\nA committee of learned doctors from Santo Tomas, who were appointed\r\nto examine the work, unmercifully scored it as attacking everything\r\nfrom the state religion to the integrity of the Spanish dominions,\r\nso the circulation of it in the Philippines was, of course, strictly\r\nprohibited, which naturally made the demand for it greater. Large\r\nsums were paid for single copies, of which, it might be remarked in\r\npassing, the author himself received scarcely any part; collections\r\nhave ever had a curious habit of going astray in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nAlthough the possession of a copy by a Filipino usually meant summary\r\nimprisonment or deportation, often with the concomitant confiscation\r\nof property for the benefit of some \"patriot,\" the book was widely read\r\namong the leading families and had the desired effect of crystallizing\r\nthe sentiment against the friars, thus to pave the way for concerted\r\naction. At last the idol had been flouted, so all could attack\r\nit. Within a year after it had begun to circulate in the Philippines a\r\nmemorial was presented to the Archbishop by quite a respectable part of\r\nthe Filipinos in Manila, requesting that the friar orders be expelled\r\nfrom the country, but this resulted only in the deportation of every\r\nsigner of the petition upon whom the government could lay hands. They\r\nwere scattered literally to the four corners of the earth: some to\r\nthe Ladrone Islands, some to Fernando Po off the west coast of Africa,\r\nsome to Spanish prisons, others to remote parts of the Philippines.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the author had returned to the Philippines for a visit\r\nto his family, during which time he was constantly attended by an\r\nofficer of the Civil Guard, detailed ostensibly as a body-guard. All\r\nhis movements were closely watched, and after a few months the\r\nCaptain-General \"advised\" him to leave the country, at the same time\r\nrequesting a copy of _Noli Me Tangere_, saying that the excerpts\r\nsubmitted to him by the censor had awakened a desire to read the\r\nentire work. Rizal returned to Europe by way of Japan and the United\r\nStates, which did not seem to make any distinct impression upon him,\r\nalthough it was only a little later that he predicted that when Spain\r\nlost control of the Philippines, an eventuality he seemed to consider\r\ncertain not far in the future, the United States would be a probable\r\nsuccessor. [9]\r\n\r\nReturning to Europe, he spent some time in London preparing an edition\r\nof Morga's _Sucesos de las Filipinas_, a work published in Mexico\r\nabout 1606 by the principal actor in some of the most stirring scenes\r\nof the formative period of the Philippine government. It is a record\r\nof prime importance in Philippine history, and the resuscitation of\r\nit was no small service to the country. Rizal added notes tending to\r\nshow that the Filipinos had been possessed of considerable culture and\r\ncivilization before the Spanish conquest, and he even intimated that\r\nthey had retrograded rather than advanced under Spanish tutelage. But\r\nsuch an extreme view must be ascribed to patriotic ardor, for Rizal\r\nhimself, though possessed of that intangible quality commonly known\r\nas genius and partly trained in northern Europe, is still in his own\r\npersonality the strongest refutation of such a contention.\r\n\r\nLater, in Ghent, he published _El Filibusterismo_, called by him a\r\ncontinuation of _Noli Me Tangere_, but with which it really has no\r\nmore connection than that some of the characters reappear and are\r\ndisposed of. [10] There is almost no connected plot in it and hardly\r\nany action, but there is the same incisive character-drawing and\r\nclear etching of conditions that characterize the earlier work. It\r\nis a maturer effort and a more forceful political argument, hence\r\nit lacks the charm and simplicity which assign _Noli Me Tangere_\r\nto a preeminent place in Philippine literature. The light satire\r\nof the earlier work is replaced by bitter sarcasm delivered with\r\ndeliberate intent, for the iron had evidently entered his soul with\r\nbroadening experience and the realization that justice at the hands\r\nof decadent Spain had been an iridescent dream of his youth. Nor had\r\nthe Spanish authorities in the Philippines been idle; his relatives\r\nhad been subjected to all the annoyances and irritations of petty\r\npersecution, eventually losing the greater part of their property,\r\nwhile some of them suffered deportation.\r\n\r\nIn 1891 he returned to Hongkong to practise medicine, in which\r\nprofession he had remarkable success, even coming to be looked\r\nupon as a wizard by his simple countrymen, among whom circulated\r\nwonderful accounts of his magical powers. He was especially skilled\r\nin ophthalmology, and his first operation after returning from his\r\nstudies in Europe was to restore his mother's sight by removing a\r\ncataract from one of her eyes, an achievement which no doubt formed\r\nthe basis of marvelous tales. But the misfortunes of his people were\r\never the paramount consideration, so he wrote to the Captain-General\r\nrequesting permission to remove his numerous relatives to Borneo to\r\nestablish a colony there, for which purpose liberal concessions had\r\nbeen offered him by the British government. The request was denied,\r\nand further stigmatized as an \"unpatriotic\" attempt to lessen the\r\npopulation of the Philippines, when labor was already scarce. This\r\nwas the answer he received to a reasonable petition after the homes\r\nof his family, including his own birthplace, had been ruthlessly\r\ndestroyed by military force, while a quarrel over ownership and rents\r\nwas still pending in the courts. The Captain-General at the time was\r\nValeriano Weyler, the pitiless instrument of the reactionary forces\r\nmanipulated by the monastic orders, he who was later sent to Cuba to\r\nintroduce there the repressive measures which had apparently been so\r\nefficacious in the Philippines, thus to bring on the interference of\r\nthe United States to end Spain's colonial power--all of which induces\r\nthe reflection that there may still be deluded casuists who doubt\r\nthe reality of Nemesis.\r\n\r\nWeyler was succeeded by Eulogio Despujols, who made sincere attempts to\r\nreform the administration, and was quite popular with the Filipinos. In\r\nreply to repeated requests from Rizal to be permitted to return to\r\nthe Philippines unmolested a passport was finally granted to him and\r\nhe set out for Manila. For this move on his part, in addition to the\r\nnatural desire to be among his own people, two special reasons appear:\r\nhe wished to investigate and stop if possible the unwarranted use of\r\nhis name in taking up collections that always remained mysteriously\r\nunaccounted for, and he was drawn by a ruse deliberately planned and\r\nexecuted in that his mother was several times officiously arrested\r\nand hustled about as a common criminal in order to work upon the\r\nson's filial feelings and thus get him back within reach of the\r\nSpanish authority, which, as subsequent events and later researches\r\nhave shown, was the real intention in issuing the passport. Entirely\r\nunsuspecting any ulterior motive, however, in a few days after his\r\narrival he convoked a motley gathering of Filipinos of all grades of\r\nthe population, for he seems to have been only slightly acquainted\r\namong his own people and not at all versed in the mazy Walpurgis\r\ndance of Philippine politics, and laid before it the constitution\r\nfor a _Liga Filipina_ (Philippine League), an organization looking\r\ntoward greater unity among the Filipinos and coöperation for economic\r\nprogress. This _Liga_ was no doubt the result of his observations in\r\nEngland and Germany, and, despite its questionable form as a secret\r\nsociety for political and economic purposes, was assuredly a step in\r\nthe right direction, but unfortunately its significance was beyond\r\nthe comprehension of his countrymen, most of whom saw in it only an\r\nopportunity for harassing the Spanish government, for which all were\r\nready enough.\r\n\r\nAll his movements were closely watched, and a few days after his\r\nreturn he was arrested on the charge of having seditious literature\r\nin his baggage. The friars were already clamoring for his blood, but\r\nDespujols seems to have been more in sympathy with Rizal than with\r\nthe men whose tool he found himself forced to be. Without trial Rizal\r\nwas ordered deported to Dapitan, a small settlement on the northern\r\ncoast of Mindanao. The decree ordering this deportation and the\r\ndestruction of all copies of his books to be found in the Philippines\r\nis a marvel of sophistry, since, in the words of a Spanish writer of\r\nthe time, \"in this document we do not know which to wonder at most: the\r\ningenuousness of the Governor-General, for in this decree he implicitly\r\nacknowledges his weakness and proneness to error, or the candor of\r\nRizal, who believed that all the way was strewn with roses.\" [11]\r\nBut it is quite evident that Despujols was playing a double game,\r\nof which he seems to have been rather ashamed, for he gave strict\r\norders that copies of the decree should be withheld from Rizal.\r\n\r\nIn Dapitan Rizal gave himself up to his studies and such medical\r\npractice as sought him out in that remote spot, for the fame of his\r\nskill was widely extended, and he was allowed to live unmolested\r\nunder parole that he would make no attempt to escape. In company\r\nwith a Jesuit missionary he gathered about him a number of native\r\nboys and conducted a practical school on the German plan, at the same\r\ntime indulging in religious polemics with his Jesuit acquaintances by\r\ncorrespondence and working fitfully on some compositions which were\r\nnever completed, noteworthy among them being a study in English of\r\nthe Tagalog verb.\r\n\r\nBut while he was living thus quietly in Dapitan, events that were to\r\ndetermine his fate were misshaping themselves in Manila. The stone had\r\nbeen loosened on the mountain-side and was bounding on in mad career,\r\nfar beyond his control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\n    He who of old would rend the oak,\r\n    Dream'd not of the rebound;\r\n    Chain'd by the trunk he vainly broke\r\n    Alone--how look'd he round?\r\n\r\n                                    BYRON.\r\n\r\n\r\nReason and moderation in the person of Rizal scorned and banished,\r\nthe spirit of Jean Paul Marat and John Brown of Ossawatomie rises to\r\nthe fore in the shape of one Andres Bonifacio, warehouse porter, who\r\nsits up o' nights copying all the letters and documents that he can lay\r\nhands on; composing grandiloquent manifestoes in Tagalog; drawing up\r\nmagnificent appointments in the names of prominent persons who would\r\nlater suffer even to the shedding of their life's blood through his\r\nmania for writing history in advance; spelling out Spanish tales of\r\nthe French Revolution; babbling of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity;\r\nhinting darkly to his confidants that the President of France had begun\r\nlife as a blacksmith. Only a few days after Rizal was so summarily\r\nhustled away, Bonifacio gathered together a crowd of malcontents and\r\nignorant dupes, some of them composing as choice a gang of cutthroats\r\nas ever slit the gullet of a Chinese or tied mutilated prisoners in\r\nant hills, and solemnly organized the _Kataastaasang Kagalang-galang\r\nKatipunan ng mga Anak ng Bayan_, \"Supreme Select Association of the\r\nSons of the People,\" for the extermination of the ruling race and\r\nthe restoration of the Golden Age. It was to bring the people into\r\nconcerted action for a general revolt on a fixed date, when they\r\nwould rise simultaneously, take possession of the city of Manila,\r\nand--the rest were better left to the imagination, for they had been\r\nreared under the Spanish colonial system and imitativeness has ever\r\nbeen pointed out as a cardinal trait in the Filipino character. No\r\nquarter was to be asked or given, and the most sacred ties, even of\r\nconsanguinity, were to be disregarded in the general slaughter. To\r\nthe inquiry of a curious neophyte as to how the Spaniards were\r\nto be distinguished from the other Europeans, in order to avoid\r\ninternational complications, dark Andres replied that in case of\r\ndoubt they should proceed with due caution but should take good care\r\nthat they made no mistakes about letting any of the _Castilas_ escape\r\ntheir vengeance. The higher officials of the government were to be\r\ntaken alive as hostages, while the friars were to be reserved for a\r\nspecial holocaust on Bagumbayan Field, where over their incinerated\r\nremains a heaven-kissing monument would be erected.\r\n\r\nThis Katipunan seems to have been an outgrowth from Spanish\r\nfreemasonry, introduced into the Philippines by a Spaniard named\r\nMorayta and Marcelo H. del Pilar, a native of Bulacan Province who was\r\nthe practical leader of the Filipinos in Spain, but who died there in\r\n1896 just as he was setting out for Hongkong to mature his plans for a\r\ngeneral uprising to expel the friar orders. There had been some masonic\r\nsocieties in the islands for some time, but the membership had been\r\nlimited to Peninsulars, and they played no part in the politics of the\r\ntime. But about 1888 Filipinos began to be admitted into some of them,\r\nand later, chiefly through the exertions of Pilar, lodges exclusively\r\nfor them were instituted. These soon began to display great activity,\r\nespecially in the transcendental matter of collections, so that their\r\nexistence became a source of care to the government and a nightmare to\r\nthe religious orders. From them, and with a perversion of the idea in\r\nRizal's still-born _Liga_, it was an easy transition to the Katipunan,\r\nwhich was to put aside all pretense of reconciliation with Spain,\r\nand at the appointed time rise to exterminate not only the friars\r\nbut also all the Spaniards and Spanish sympathizers, thus to bring\r\nabout the reign of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity, under the benign\r\nguidance of Patriot Bonifacio, with his bolo for a scepter.\r\n\r\nWith its secrecy and mystic forms, its methods of threats and\r\nintimidation, the Katipunan spread rapidly, especially among the\r\nTagalogs, the most intransigent of the native peoples, and, it should\r\nbe noted, the ones in Whose territory the friars were the principal\r\nlandlords. It was organized on the triangle plan, so that no member\r\nmight know or communicate with more than three others--the one above\r\nhim from whom he received his information and instructions and two\r\nbelow to whom he transmitted them. The initiations were conducted with\r\ngreat secrecy and solemnity, calculated to inspire the new members\r\nwith awe and fear. The initiate, after a series of blood-curdling\r\nordeals to try out his courage and resolution, swore on a human skull\r\na terrific oath to devote his life and energies to the extermination\r\nof the white race, regardless of age or sex, and later affixed to\r\nit his signature or mark, usually the latter, with his own blood\r\ntaken from an incision in the left arm or left breast. This was one\r\nform of the famous \"blood compact,\" which, if history reads aright,\r\nplayed so important a part in the assumption of sovereignty over the\r\nPhilippines by Legazpi in the name of Philip II.\r\n\r\nRizal was made the honorary president of the association, his\r\nportrait hung in all the meeting-halls, and the magic of his name\r\nused to attract the easily deluded masses, who were in a state of\r\nagitated ignorance and growing unrest, ripe for any movement that\r\nlooked anti-governmental, and especially anti-Spanish. Soon after\r\nthe organization had been perfected, collections began to be taken\r\nup--those collections were never overlooked--for the purpose of\r\nchartering a steamer to rescue him from Dapitan and transport him to\r\nSingapore, whence he might direct the general uprising, the day and\r\nthe hour for which were fixed by Bonifacio for August twenty-sixth,\r\n1896, at six o'clock sharp in the evening, since lack of precision\r\nin his magnificent programs was never a fault of that bold patriot,\r\nhis logic being as severe as that of the Filipino policeman who put\r\nthe flag at half-mast on Good Friday.\r\n\r\nOf all this Rizal himself was, of course, entirely ignorant, until\r\nin May, 1896, a Filipino doctor named Pio Valenzuela, a creature of\r\nBonifacio's, was despatched to Dapitan, taking along a blind man as a\r\npretext for the visit to the famous oculist, to lay the plans before\r\nhim for his consent and approval. Rizal expostulated with Valenzuela\r\nfor a time over such a mad and hopeless venture, which would only bring\r\nruin and misery upon the masses, and then is said to have very humanly\r\nlost his patience, ending the interview \"in so bad a humor and with\r\nwords so offensive that the deponent, who had gone with the intention\r\nof remaining there a month, took the steamer on the following day, for\r\nreturn to Manila.\" [12] He reported secretly to Bonifacio, who bestowed\r\nseveral choice Tagalog epithets on Rizal, and charged his envoy to\r\nsay nothing about the failure of his mission, but rather to give the\r\nimpression that he had been successful. Rizal's name continued to be\r\nused as the shibboleth of the insurrection, and the masses were made\r\nto believe that he would appear as their leader at the appointed hour.\r\n\r\nVague reports from police officers, to the effect that something\r\nunusual in the nature of secret societies was going on among the\r\npeople, began to reach the government, but no great attention was\r\npaid to them, until the evening of August nineteenth, when the parish\r\npriest of Tondo was informed by the mother-superior of one of the\r\nconvent-schools that she had just learned of a plot to massacre all\r\nthe Spaniards. She had the information from a devoted pupil, whose\r\nbrother was a compositor in the office of the _Diario de Manila_. As\r\nis so frequently the case in Filipino families, this elder sister was\r\nthe purse-holder, and the brother's insistent requests for money,\r\nwhich was needed by him to meet the repeated assessments made on\r\nthe members as the critical hour approached, awakened her curiosity\r\nand suspicion to such an extent that she forced him to confide the\r\nwhole plan to her. Without delay she divulged it to her patroness,\r\nwho in turn notified the curate of Tondo, where the printing-office\r\nwas located. The priest called in two officers of the Civil Guard, who\r\narrested the young printer, frightened a confession out of him, and\r\nthat night, in company with the friar, searched the printing-office,\r\nfinding secreted there several lithographic plates for printing\r\nreceipts and certificates of membership in the Katipunan, with a\r\nnumber of documents giving some account of the plot.\r\n\r\nThen the Spanish population went wild. General Ramon Blanco was\r\ngovernor and seems to have been about the only person who kept his\r\nhead at all. He tried to prevent giving so irresponsible a movement a\r\nfictitious importance, but was utterly powerless to stay the clamor\r\nfor blood which at once arose, loudest on the part of those alleged\r\nministers of the gentle Christ. The gates of the old Walled City,\r\nlong fallen into disuse, were cleaned and put in order, martial law\r\nwas declared, and wholesale arrests made. Many of the prisoners were\r\nconfined in Fort Santiago, one batch being crowded into a dungeon\r\nfor which the only ventilation was a grated opening at the top, and\r\none night a sergeant of the guard carelessly spread his sleeping-mat\r\nover this, so the next morning some fifty-five asphyxiated corpses\r\nwere hauled away. On the twenty-sixth armed insurrection broke out at\r\nCaloocan, just north of Manila, from time immemorial the resort of bad\r\ncharacters from all the country round and the center of brigandage,\r\nwhile at San Juan del Monte, on the outskirts of the city, several\r\nbloody skirmishes were fought a few days later with the _Guardia\r\nCivil Veterana_, the picked police force.\r\n\r\nBonifacio had been warned of the discovery of his schemes in time to\r\nmake his escape and flee to the barrio, or village, of Balintawak,\r\na few miles north of Manila, thence to lead the attack on Caloocan\r\nand inaugurate the reign of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity in the\r\nmanner in which Philippine insurrections have generally had a habit\r\nof starting--with the murder of Chinese merchants and the pillage of\r\ntheir shops. He had from the first reserved for himself the important\r\noffice of treasurer in the Katipunan, in addition to being on occasions\r\npresident and at all times its ruling spirit, so he now established\r\nhimself as dictator and proceeded to appoint a magnificent staff, most\r\nof whom contrived to escape as soon as they were out of reach of his\r\nbolo. Yet he drew considerable numbers about him, for this man, though\r\nalmost entirely unlettered, seems to have been quite a personality\r\namong his own people, especially possessed of that gift of oratory\r\nin his native tongue to which the Malay is so preeminently susceptible.\r\n\r\nIn Manila a special tribunal was constituted and worked steadily,\r\nsometimes through the siesta-hour, for there were times, of which\r\nthis was one, when even Spanish justice could be swift. Bagumbayan\r\nbegan to be a veritable field of blood, as the old methods of\r\nrepression were resorted to for the purpose of striking terror into\r\nthe native population by wholesale executions, nor did the ruling\r\npowers realize that the time for such methods had passed. It was a\r\ncase of sixteenth-century colonial methods fallen into fretful and\r\nfrantic senility, so in all this wretched business it is doubtful whim\r\nto pity the more: the blind stupidity of the fossilized conservatives\r\nincontinently throwing an empire away, forfeiting their influence over\r\na people whom they, by temperament and experience, should have been\r\nfitted to control and govern; or the potential cruelty of perverted\r\nhuman nature in the dark Frankenstein who would wreak upon the rulers\r\nin their decadent days the most hideous of the methods in the system\r\nthat produced him, as he planned his festive holocaust and carmagnole\r\non the spot where every spark of initiative and leadership among\r\nhis people, both good and bad, had been summarily and ruthlessly\r\nextinguished. There is at least a world of reflection in it for the\r\nrulers of men.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Rizal, wearying of the quiet life in Dapitan and\r\ndoubtless foreseeing the impending catastrophe, had requested leave\r\nto volunteer his services as a physician in the military hospitals\r\nof Cuba, of the horrors and sufferings in which he had heard. General\r\nBlanco at once gladly acceded to this request and had him brought to\r\nManila, but unfortunately the boat carrying him arrived there a day\r\ntoo late for him to catch the regular August mail-steamer to Spain,\r\nso he was kept in the cruiser a prisoner of war, awaiting the next\r\ntransportation. While he was thus detained, the Katipunan plot was\r\ndiscovered and the rebellion broke out. He was accused of being\r\nthe head of it, but Blanco gave him a personal letter completely\r\nexonerating him from any complicity in the outbreak, as well as a\r\nletter of recommendation to the Spanish minister of war. He was placed\r\non the _Isla de Panay_ when it left for Spain on September third and\r\ntraveled at first as a passenger. At Singapore he was advised to land\r\nand claim British protection, as did some of his fellow travelers,\r\nbut he refused to do so, saying that his conscience was clear.\r\n\r\nAs the name of Rizal had constantly recurred during the trials\r\nof the Katipunan suspects, the military tribunal finally issued a\r\nformal demand for him. The order of arrest was cabled to Port Said\r\nand Rizal there placed in solitary confinement for the remainder\r\nof the voyage. Arrived at Barcelona, he was confined in the grim\r\nfortress of Montjuich, where; by a curious coincidence, the governor\r\nwas the same Despujols who had issued the decree of banishment in\r\n1892. Shortly afterwards, he was placed on the transport _Colon_,\r\nwhich was bound for the Philippines with troops, Blanco having at last\r\nbeen stirred to action. Strenuous efforts were now made by Rizal's\r\nfriends in London to have him removed from the ship at Singapore,\r\nbut the British authorities declined to take any action, on the ground\r\nthat he was on a Spanish warship and therefore beyond the jurisdiction\r\nof their courts. The _Colon_ arrived at Manila on November third and\r\nRizal was imprisoned in Fort Santiago, while a special tribunal was\r\nconstituted to try him on the charges of carrying on anti-patriotic\r\nand anti-religious propaganda, rebellion, sedition, and the formation\r\nof illegal associations. Some other charges may have been overlooked\r\nin the hurry and excitement.\r\n\r\nIt would be almost a travesty to call a trial the proceedings which\r\nbegan early in December and dragged along until the twenty-sixth. Rizal\r\nwas defended by a young Spanish officer selected by him from among\r\na number designated by the tribunal, who chivalrously performed so\r\nunpopular a duty as well as he could. But the whole affair was a\r\nmockery of justice, for the Spanish government in the Philippines had\r\nfinally and hopelessly reached the condition graphically pictured by\r\nMr. Kipling:\r\n\r\n\r\n            Panic that shells the drifting spar--\r\n            Loud waste with none to check--\r\n            Mad fear that rakes a scornful star\r\n            Or sweeps a consort's deck!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe clamor against Blanco had resulted in his summary removal by royal\r\ndecree and the appointment of a real \"pacificator,\" Camilo Polavieja.\r\n\r\nWhile in prison Rizal prepared an address to those of his countrymen\r\nwho were in armed rebellion, repudiating the use of his name and\r\ndeprecating the resort to violence. The closing words are a compendium\r\nof his life and beliefs: \"Countrymen: I have given proofs, as well as\r\nthe best of you, of desiring liberty for our country, and I continue\r\nto desire it. But I place as a premise the education of the people,\r\nso that by means of instruction and work they may have a personality\r\nof their own and that they may make themselves worthy of that same\r\nliberty. In my writings I have recommended the study of the civic\r\nvirtues, without which there can be no redemption. I have also written\r\n(and my words have been repeated) that reforms, to be fruitful, must\r\ncome from _above_, that those which spring from _below_ are uncertain\r\nand insecure movements. Imbued with these ideas, I cannot do less than\r\ncondemn, and I do condemn, this absurd, savage rebellion, planned\r\nbehind my back, which dishonors the Filipinos and discredits those\r\nwho can speak for us. I abominate all criminal actions and refuse any\r\nkind of participation in them, pitying with all my heart the dupes who\r\nhave allowed themselves to be deceived. Go back, then, to your homes,\r\nand may God forgive those who have acted in bad faith.\" This address,\r\nhowever, was not published by the Spanish authorities, since they did\r\nnot consider it \"patriotic\" enough; instead, they killed the writer!\r\n\r\nRizal appeared before the tribunal bound, closely guarded by two\r\nPeninsular soldiers, but maintained his serenity throughout and\r\nanswered the charges in a straightforward way. He pointed out the\r\nfact that he had never taken any great part in politics, having\r\neven quarreled with Marcelo del Pilar, the active leader of the\r\nanti-clericals, by reason of those perennial \"subscriptions,\" and that\r\nduring the time he was accused of being the instigator and organizer of\r\narmed rebellion he had been a close prisoner in Dapitan under strict\r\nsurveillance by both the military and ecclesiastical authorities. The\r\nprosecutor presented a lengthy document, which ran mostly to words,\r\nabout the only definite conclusion laid down in it being that the\r\nPhilippines \"are, and always must remain, Spanish territory.\" What\r\nthere may have been in Rizal's career to hang such a conclusion\r\nupon is not quite dear, but at any rate this learned legal light was\r\nevidently still thinking in colors on the map serenely unconscious in\r\nhis European pseudo-prescience of the new and wonderful development\r\nin the Western Hemisphere--humanity militant, Lincolnism.\r\n\r\nThe death sentence was asked, but the longer the case dragged on the\r\nmore favorable it began to look for the accused, so the president\r\nof the tribunal, after deciding, Jeffreys-like, that the charges had\r\nbeen proved, ordered that no further evidence be taken. Rizal betrayed\r\nsome sunrise when his doom was thus foreshadowed, for, dreamer that\r\nhe was, he seems not to have anticipated such a fatal eventuality for\r\nhimself. He did not lose his serenity, however, even when the tribunal\r\npromptly brought in a verdict of guilty and imposed the death sentence,\r\nupon which Polavieja the next day placed his _Cúmplase_, fixing the\r\nmorning of December thirtieth for the execution.\r\n\r\nSo Rizal's fate was sealed. The witnesses against him, in so far\r\nas there was any substantial testimony at all, had been his own\r\ncountrymen, coerced or cajoled into making statements which they have\r\nsince repudiated as false, and which in some cases were extorted from\r\nthem by threats and even torture. But he betrayed very little emotion,\r\neven maintaining what must have been an assumed cheerfulness. Only\r\none reproach is recorded: that he had been made a dupe of, that he had\r\nbeen deceived by every one, even the _bankeros_ and _cocheros_. His old\r\nJesuit instructors remained with him in the _capilla_, or death-cell,\r\n[13] and largely through the influence of an image of the Sacred Heart,\r\nwhich he had carved as a schoolboy, it is claimed that a reconciliation\r\nwith the Church was effected. There has been considerable pragmatical\r\ndiscussion as to what form of retraction from him was necessary,\r\nsince he had been, after studying in Europe, a frank freethinker, but\r\nsuch futile polemics may safely be left to the learned doctors. That\r\nhe was reconciled with the Church would seem to be evidenced by\r\nthe fact that just before the execution he gave legal status as\r\nhis wife to the woman, a rather remarkable Eurasian adventuress,\r\nwho had lived with him in Dapitan, and the religious ceremony was\r\nthe only one then recognized in the islands. [14] The greater part\r\nof his last night on earth was spent in composing a chain of verse;\r\nno very majestic flight of poesy, but a pathetic monody throbbing with\r\npatient resignation and inextinguishable hope, one of the sweetest,\r\nsaddest swan-songs ever sung.\r\n\r\nThus he was left at the last, entirely alone. As soon as his doom\r\nbecame certain the Patriots had all scurried to cover, one gentle\r\npoetaster even rushing into doggerel verse to condemn him as a\r\nreversion to barbarism; the wealthier suspects betook themselves\r\nto other lands or made judicious use of their money-bags among the\r\nSpanish officials; the better classes of the population floundered\r\nhopelessly, leaderless, in the confused whirl of opinions and passions;\r\nwhile the voiceless millions for whom he had spoken moved on in dumb,\r\nuncomprehending silence. He had lived in that higher dreamland of\r\nthe future, ahead of his countrymen, ahead even of those who assumed\r\nto be the mentors of his people, and he must learn, as does every\r\nnoble soul that labors \"to make the bounds of freedom wider yet,\"\r\nthe bitter lesson that nine-tenths, if not all, the woes that afflict\r\nhumanity spring from man's own stupid selfishness, that the wresting\r\nof the scepter from the tyrant is often the least of the task, that\r\nthe bondman comes to love his bonds--like Chillon's prisoner, his very\r\nchains and he grow friends,--but that the struggle for human freedom\r\nmust go on, at whatever cost, in ever-widening circles, \"wave after\r\nwave, each mightier than the last,\" for as long as one body toils in\r\nfetters or one mind welters in blind ignorance, either of the slave's\r\nbase delusion or the despot's specious illusion, there can be no final\r\nsecurity for any free man, or his children, or his children's children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n    \"God save thee, ancient Mariner!\r\n    From the fiends, that plague thee thus!\r\n    Why look'st thou so?\"--\"With my cross-bow\r\n    I shot the Albatross!\"\r\n\r\n                                     COLERIDGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was one of those magic December mornings of the tropics--the very\r\nnuptials of earth and sky, when great Nature seems to fling herself\r\nincontinently into creation, wrapping the world in a brooding calm of\r\nlight and color, that Spain chose for committing political suicide\r\nin the Philippines. Bagumbayan Field was crowded with troops, both\r\nregulars and militia, for every man capable of being trusted with\r\narms was drawn up there, excepting only the necessary guards in other\r\nparts of the city. Extra patrols were in the streets, double guards\r\nwere placed over the archiepiscopal and gubernatorial palaces. The\r\ncalmest man in all Manila that day was he who must stand before the\r\nfiring-squad.\r\n\r\nTwo special and unusual features are to be noted about this\r\nexecution. All the principal actors were Filipinos: the commander of\r\nthe troops and the officer directly in charge of the execution were\r\nnative-born, while the firing-squad itself was drawn from a local\r\nnative regiment, though it is true that on this occasion a squad of\r\nPeninsular _cazadores_, armed with loaded Mausers, stood directly\r\nbehind them to see that they failed not in their duty. Again, there\r\nwas but one victim; for it seems to have ever been the custom of\r\nthe Spanish rulers to associate in these gruesome affairs some real\r\ncriminals with the political offenders, no doubt with the intentional\r\npurpose of confusing the issue in the general mind. Rizal standing\r\nalone, the occasion of so much hurried preparation and fearful\r\nprecaution, is a pathetic testimonial to the degree of incapacity\r\ninto which the ruling powers had fallen, even in chicanery.\r\n\r\nAfter bidding good-by to his sister and making final disposition\r\nregarding some personal property, the doomed man, under close guard,\r\nwalked calmly, even cheerfully, from Fort Santiago along the Malecon\r\nto the Luneta, accompanied by his Jesuit confessors. Arrived there, he\r\nthanked those about him for their kindness and requested the officer\r\nin charge to allow him to face the firing-squad, since he had never\r\nbeen a traitor to Spain. This the officer declined to permit, for\r\nthe order was to shoot him in the back. Rizal assented with a slight\r\nprotest, pointed out to the soldiers the spot in his back at which\r\nthey should aim, and with a firm step took his place in front of them.\r\n\r\nThen occurred an act almost too hideous to record. There he stood,\r\nexpecting a volley of Remington bullets in his back--Time was, and\r\nLife's stream ebbed to Eternity's flood--when the military surgeon\r\nstepped forward and asked if he might feel his pulse! Rizal extended\r\nhis left hand, and the officer remarked that he could not understand\r\nhow a man's pulse could beat normally at such a terrific moment! The\r\nvictim shrugged his shoulders and let the hand fall again to his\r\nside--Latin refinement could be no further refined!\r\n\r\nA moment later there he lay, on his right side, his life-blood\r\nspurting over the Luneta curb, eyes wide open, fixedly staring at that\r\nHeaven where the priests had taught all those centuries agone that\r\nJustice abides. The troops filed past the body, for the most part\r\nsilently, while desultory cries of \"_Viva España!_\" from among the\r\n\"patriotic\" Filipino volunteers were summarily hushed by a Spanish\r\nartillery-officer's stern rebuke: \"Silence, you rabble!\" To drown\r\nout the fitful cheers and the audible murmurs, the bands struck\r\nup Spanish national airs. Stranger death-dirge no man and system\r\never had. Carnival revelers now dance about the scene and Filipino\r\nschoolboys play baseball over that same spot.\r\n\r\nA few days later another execution was held on that spot, of members\r\nof the _Liga_, some of them characters that would have richly deserved\r\nshooting at any place or time, according to existing standards, but\r\nnotable among them there knelt, torture-crazed, as to his orisons,\r\nFrancisco Roxas, millionaire capitalist, who may be regarded as the\r\nsocial and economic head of the Filipino people, as Rizal was fitted\r\nto be their intellectual leader. Shades of Anda and Vargas! Out there\r\nat Balintawak--rather fitly, \"the home of the snake-demon,\"--not three\r\nhours' march from this same spot, on the very edge of the city, Andres\r\nBonifacio and his literally sansculottic gangs of cutthroats were,\r\nalmost with impunity, soiling the fair name of Freedom with murder\r\nand mutilation, rape and rapine, awakening the worst passions of an\r\nexcitable, impulsive people, destroying that essential respect for\r\nlaw and order, which to restore would take a holocaust of fire and\r\nblood, with a generation of severe training. Unquestionably did Rizal\r\ndemonstrate himself to be a seer and prophet when he applied to such\r\na system the story of Babylon and the fateful handwriting on the wall!\r\n\r\nBut forces had been loosed that would not be so suppressed, the time\r\nhad gone by when such wild methods of repression would serve. The\r\ndestruction of the native leaders, culminating in the executions\r\nof Rizal and Roxas, produced a counter-effect by rousing the\r\nTagalogs, good and bad alike, to desperate fury, and the aftermath\r\nwas frightful. The better classes were driven to take part in the\r\nrebellion, and Cavite especially became a veritable slaughter-pen,\r\nas the contest settled down into a hideous struggle for mutual\r\nextermination. Dark Andres went his wild way to perish by the\r\nviolence he had himself invoked, a prey to the rising ambition of\r\na young leader of considerable culture and ability, a schoolmaster\r\nnamed Emilio Aguinaldo. His Katipunan hovered fitfully around Manila,\r\nfor a time even drawing to itself in their desperation some of the\r\nbetter elements of the population, only to find itself sold out and\r\ndeserted by its leaders, dying away for a time; but later, under\r\nchanged conditions, it reappeared in strange metamorphosis as the\r\nrallying-center for the largest number of Filipinos who have ever\r\ngathered together for a common purpose, and then finally went down\r\nbefore those thin grim lines in khaki with sharp and sharpest shot\r\nclearing away the wreck of the old, blazing the way for the new:\r\nthe broadening sweep of \"Democracy announcing, in rifle-volleys\r\ndeath-winged, under her Star Banner, to the tune of Yankee-doodle-do,\r\nthat she is born, and, whirlwind-like, will envelop the whole world!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMANILA, December 1, 1909\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat?

In spite of the fact that, contrary to\r\nhis usual custom, he had made the announcement only that afternoon,\r\nit was already the sole topic of conversation in Binondo and adjacent\r\ndistricts, and even in the Walled City, for at that time Capitan\r\nTiago was considered one of the most hospitable of men, and it was\r\nwell known that his house, like his country, shut its doors against\r\nnothing except commerce and all new or bold ideas. Like an electric\r\nshock the announcement ran through the world of parasites, bores,\r\nand hangers-on, whom God in His infinite bounty creates and so kindly\r\nmultiplies in Manila. Some looked at once for shoe-polish, others\r\nfor buttons and cravats, but all were especially concerned about how\r\nto greet the master of the house in the most familiar tone, in order\r\nto create an atmosphere of ancient friendship or, if occasion should\r\narise, to excuse a late arrival.\r\n\r\nThis dinner was given in a house on Calle Anloague, and although we do\r\nnot remember the number we will describe it in such a way that it may\r\nstill be recognized, provided the earthquakes have not destroyed it. We\r\ndo not believe that its owner has had it torn down, for such labors are\r\ngenerally entrusted to God or nature--which Powers hold the contracts\r\nalso for many of the projects of our government. It is a rather large\r\nbuilding, in the style of many in the country, and fronts upon the arm\r\nof the Pasig which is known to some as the Binondo River, and which,\r\nlike all the streams in Manila, plays the varied rôles of bath, sewer,\r\nlaundry, fishery, means of transportation and communication, and even\r\ndrinking water if the Chinese water-carrier finds it convenient. It\r\nis worthy of note that in the distance of nearly a mile this important\r\nartery of the district, where traffic is most dense and movement most\r\ndeafening, can boast of only one wooden bridge, which is out of repair\r\non one side for six months and impassable on the other for the rest of\r\nthe year, so that during the hot season the ponies take advantage of\r\nthis permanent _status quo_ to jump off the bridge into the water,\r\nto the great surprise of the abstracted mortal who may be dozing\r\ninside the carriage or philosophizing upon the progress of the age.\r\n\r\nThe house of which we are speaking is somewhat low and not exactly\r\ncorrect in all its lines: whether the architect who built it was\r\nafflicted with poor eyesight or whether the earthquakes and typhoons\r\nhave twisted it out of shape, no one can say with certainty. A wide\r\nstaircase with green newels and carpeted steps leads from the tiled\r\nentrance up to the main floor between rows of flower-pots set upon\r\npedestals of motley-colored and fantastically decorated Chinese\r\nporcelain. Since there are neither porters nor servants who demand\r\ninvitation cards, we will go in, O you who read this, whether friend or\r\nfoe, if you are attracted by the strains of the orchestra, the lights,\r\nor the suggestive rattling of dishes, knives, and forks, and if you\r\nwish to see what such a gathering is like in the distant Pearl of\r\nthe Orient. Gladly, and for my own comfort, I should spare you this\r\ndescription of the house, were it not of great importance, since we\r\nmortals in general are very much like tortoises: we are esteemed and\r\nclassified according to our shells; in this and still other respects\r\nthe mortals of the Philippines in particular also resemble tortoises.\r\n\r\nIf we go up the stairs, we immediately find ourselves in a spacious\r\nhallway, called there, for some unknown reason, the _caida_, which\r\ntonight serves as the dining-room and at the same time affords a\r\nplace for the orchestra. In the center a large table profusely and\r\nexpensively decorated seems to beckon to the hanger-on with sweet\r\npromises, while it threatens the bashful maiden, the simple _dalaga_,\r\nwith two mortal hours in the company of strangers whose language and\r\nconversation usually have a very restricted and special character.\r\n\r\nContrasted with these terrestrial preparations are the motley paintings\r\non the walls representing religious matters, such as \"Purgatory,\"\r\n\"Hell,\" \"The Last Judgment,\" \"The Death of the Just,\" and \"The Death\r\nof the Sinner.\"\r\n\r\nAt the back of the room, fastened in a splendid and elegant framework,\r\nin the Renaissance style, possibly by Arévalo, is a glass case in\r\nwhich are seen the figures of two old women. The inscription on this\r\nreads: \"Our Lady of Peace and Prosperous Voyages, who is worshiped in\r\nAntipolo, visiting in the disguise of a beggar the holy and renowned\r\nCapitana Inez during her sickness.\" [15] While the work reveals little\r\ntaste or art, yet it possesses in compensation an extreme realism,\r\nfor to judge from the yellow and bluish tints of her face the sick\r\nwoman seems to be already a decaying corpse, and the glasses and other\r\nobjects, accompaniments of long illness, are so minutely reproduced\r\nthat even their contents may be distinguished. In looking at these\r\npictures, which excite the appetite and inspire gay bucolic ideas, one\r\nmay perhaps be led to think that the malicious host is well acquainted\r\nwith the characters of the majority of those who are to sit at his\r\ntable and that, in order to conceal his own way of thinking, he has\r\nhung from the ceiling costly Chinese lanterns; bird-cages without\r\nbirds; red, green, and blue globes of frosted glass; faded air-plants;\r\nand dried and inflated fishes, which they call _botetes_. The view is\r\nclosed on the side of the river by curious wooden arches, half Chinese\r\nand half European, affording glimpses of a terrace with arbors and\r\nbowers faintly lighted by paper lanterns of many colors.\r\n\r\nIn the sala, among massive mirrors and gleaming chandeliers, the\r\nguests are assembled. Here, on a raised platform, stands a grand\r\npiano of great price, which tonight has the additional virtue of not\r\nbeing played upon. Here, hanging on the wall, is an oil-painting of a\r\nhandsome man in full dress, rigid, erect, straight as the tasseled cane\r\nhe holds in his stiff, ring-covered fingers--the whole seeming to say,\r\n\"Ahem! See how well dressed and how dignified I am!\" The furnishings\r\nof the room are elegant and perhaps uncomfortable and unhealthful,\r\nsince the master of the house would consider not so much the comfort\r\nand health of his guests as his own ostentation, \"A terrible thing\r\nis dysentery,\" he would say to them, \"but you are sitting in European\r\nchairs and that is something you don't find every day.\"\r\n\r\nThis room is almost filled with people, the men being separated from\r\nthe women as in synagogues and Catholic churches. The women consist of\r\na number of Filipino and Spanish maidens, who, when they open their\r\nmouths to yawn, instantly cover them with their fans and who murmur\r\nonly a few words to each other, any conversation ventured upon dying\r\nout in monosyllables like the sounds heard in a house at night, sounds\r\nmade by the rats and lizards. Is it perhaps the different likenesses\r\nof Our Lady hanging on the walls that force them to silence and a\r\nreligious demeanor or is it that the women here are an exception?\r\n\r\nA cousin of Capitan Tiago, a sweet-faced old woman, who speaks Spanish\r\nquite badly, is the only one receiving the ladies. To offer to the\r\nSpanish ladies a plate of cigars and _buyos_, to extend her hand to\r\nher countrywomen to be kissed, exactly as the friars do,--this is\r\nthe sum of her courtesy, her policy. The poor old lady soon became\r\nbored, and taking advantage of the noise of a plate breaking, rushed\r\nprecipitately away, muttering, \"_Jesús!_ Just wait, you rascals!\" and\r\nfailed to reappear.\r\n\r\nThe men, for their part, are making more of a stir. Some cadets\r\nin one corner are conversing in a lively manner but in low tones,\r\nlooking around now and then to point out different persons in the room\r\nwhile they laugh more or less openly among themselves. In contrast,\r\ntwo foreigners dressed in white are promenading silently from one end\r\nof the room to the other with their hands crossed behind their backs,\r\nlike the bored passengers on the deck of a ship. All the interest and\r\nthe greatest animation proceed from a group composed of two priests,\r\ntwo civilians, and a soldier who are seated around a small table on\r\nwhich are seen bottles of wine and English biscuits.\r\n\r\nThe soldier, a tall, elderly lieutenant with an austere countenance--a\r\nDuke of Alva straggling behind in the roster of the Civil Guard--talks\r\nlittle, but in a harsh, curt way. One of the priests, a youthful\r\nDominican friar, handsome, graceful, polished as the gold-mounted\r\neyeglasses he wears, maintains a premature gravity. He is the curate\r\nof Binondo and has been in former years a professor in the college of\r\nSan Juan de Letran, [16] where he enjoyed the reputation of being a\r\nconsummate dialectician, so much so that in the days when the sons\r\nof Guzman [17] still dared to match themselves in subtleties with\r\nlaymen, the able disputant B. de Luna had never been able either to\r\ncatch or to confuse him, the distinctions made by Fray Sibyla leaving\r\nhis opponent in the situation of a fisherman who tries to catch eels\r\nwith a lasso. The Dominican says little, appearing to weigh his words.\r\n\r\nQuite in contrast, the other priest, a Franciscan, talks much and\r\ngesticulates more. In spite of the fact that his hair is beginning to\r\nturn gray, he seems to be preserving well his robust constitution,\r\nwhile his regular features, his rather disquieting glance, his wide\r\njaws and herculean frame give him the appearance of a Roman noble in\r\ndisguise and make us involuntarily recall one of those three monks of\r\nwhom Heine tells in his \"Gods in Exile,\" who at the September equinox\r\nin the Tyrol used to cross a lake at midnight and each time place in\r\nthe hand of the poor boatman a silver piece, cold as ice, which left\r\nhim full of terror. [18] But Fray Damaso is not so mysterious as they\r\nwere. He is full of merriment, and if the tone of his voice is rough\r\nlike that of a man who has never had occasion to correct himself and\r\nwho believes that whatever he says is holy and above improvement, still\r\nhis frank, merry laugh wipes out this disagreeable impression and even\r\nobliges us to pardon his showing to the room bare feet and hairy legs\r\nthat would make the fortune of a Mendieta in the Quiapo fairs. [19]\r\n\r\nOne of the civilians is a very small man with a black beard, the only\r\nthing notable about him being his nose, which, to judge from its size,\r\nought not to belong to him. The other is a rubicund youth, who seems\r\nto have arrived but recently in the country. With him the Franciscan\r\nis carrying on a lively discussion.\r\n\r\n\"You'll see,\" the friar was saying, \"when you've been here a few\r\nmonths you'll be convinced of what I say. It's one thing to govern\r\nin Madrid and another to live in the Philippines.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--\"\r\n\r\n\"I, for example,\" continued Fray Damaso, raising his voice still\r\nhigher to prevent the other from speaking, \"I, for example, who can\r\nlook back over twenty-three years of bananas and _morisqueta_, know\r\nwhereof I speak. Don't come at me with theories and fine speeches,\r\nfor I know the Indian. [20] Mark well that the moment I arrived in the\r\ncountry I was assigned to a toxin, small it is true, but especially\r\ndevoted to agriculture. I didn't understand Tagalog very well then,\r\nbut I was, soon confessing the women, and we understood one another\r\nand they came to like me so well that three years later, when I was\r\ntransferred to another and larger town, made vacant by the death of\r\nthe native curate, all fell to weeping, they heaped gifts upon me,\r\nthey escorted me with music--\"\r\n\r\n\"But that only goes to show--\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait, wait! Don't be so hasty! My successor remained a shorter\r\ntime, and when he left he had more attendance, more tears, and more\r\nmusic. Yet he had been more given to whipping and had raised the fees\r\nin the parish to almost double.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you will allow me--\"\r\n\r\n\"But that isn't all. I stayed in the town of San Diego twenty years\r\nand it has been only a few months since I left it.\"\r\n\r\nHere he showed signs of chagrin.\r\n\r\n\"Twenty years, no one can deny, are more than sufficient to get\r\nacquainted with a town. San Diego has a population of six thousand\r\nsouls and I knew every inhabitant as well as if I had been his mother\r\nand wet-nurse. I knew in which foot this one was lame, where the\r\nshoe pinched that one, who was courting that girl, what affairs she\r\nhad had and with whom, who was the real father of the child, and so\r\non--for I was the confessor of every last one, and they took care not\r\nto fail in their duty. Our host, Santiago, will tell you whether I am\r\nspeaking the truth, for he has a lot of land there and that was where\r\nwe first became friends. Well then, you may see what the Indian is:\r\nwhen I left I was escorted by only a few old women and some of the\r\ntertiary brethren--and that after I had been there twenty years!\"\r\n\r\n\"But I don't see what that has to do with the abolition of the tobacco\r\nmonopoly,\" [21] ventured the rubicund youth, taking advantage of the\r\nFranciscan's pausing to drink a glass of sherry.\r\n\r\nFray Damaso was so greatly surprised that he nearly let his glass\r\nfall. He remained for a moment staring fixedly at the young man.\r\n\r\n\"What? How's that?\" he was finally able to exclaim in great\r\nwonderment. \"Is it possible that you don't see it as clear as\r\nday? Don't you see, my son, that all this proves plainly that the\r\nreforms of the ministers are irrational?\"\r\n\r\nIt was now the youth's turn to look perplexed. The lieutenant wrinkled\r\nhis eyebrows a little more and the small man nodded toward Fray Damaso\r\nequivocally. The Dominican contented himself with almost turning his\r\nback on the whole group.\r\n\r\n\"Do you really believe so?\" the young man at length asked with great\r\nseriousness, as he looked at the friar with curiosity.\r\n\r\n\"Do I believe so? As I believe the Gospel! The Indian is so indolent!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, pardon me for interrupting you,\" said the young man, lowering\r\nhis voice and drawing his chair a little closer, \"but you have said\r\nsomething that awakens all my interest. Does this indolence actually,\r\nnaturally, exist among the natives or is there some truth in what a\r\nforeign traveler says: that with this indolence we excuse our own,\r\nas well as our backwardness and our colonial system. He referred to\r\nother colonies whose inhabitants belong to the same race--\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah, jealousy! Ask Señor Laruja, who also knows this country. Ask him\r\nif there is any equal to the ignorance and indolence of the Indian.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's true,\" affirmed the little man, who was referred to as Señor\r\nLaruja. \"In no part of the world can you find any one more indolent\r\nthan the Indian, in no part of the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor more vicious, nor more ungrateful!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor more unmannerly!\"\r\n\r\nThe rubicund youth began to glance about nervously. \"Gentlemen,\" he\r\nwhispered, \"I believe that we are in the house of an Indian. Those\r\nyoung ladies--\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah, don't be so apprehensive! Santiago doesn't consider himself an\r\nIndian--and besides, he's not here. And what if he were! These are\r\nthe nonsensical ideas of the newcomers. Let a few months pass and you\r\nwill change your opinion, after you have attended a lot of fiestas\r\nand _bailúhan_, slept on cots, and eaten your fill of _tinola_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, is this thing that you call _tinola_ a variety of lotus which\r\nmakes people--er--forgetful?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing of the kind!\" exclaimed Fray Damaso with a smile. \"You're\r\ngetting absurd. _Tinola_ is a stew of chicken and squash. How long\r\nhas it been since you got here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Four days,\" responded the youth, rather offended.\r\n\r\n\"Have you come as a government employee?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, I've come at my own expense to study the country.\"\r\n\r\n\"Man, what a rare bird!\" exclaimed Fray Damaso, staring at him with\r\ncuriosity. \"To come at one's own expense and for such foolishness! What\r\na wonder! When there are so many books! And with two fingerbreadths\r\nof forehead! Many have written books as big as that! With two\r\nfingerbreadths of forehead!\"\r\n\r\nThe Dominican here brusquely broke in upon the conversation. \"Did\r\nyour Reverence, Fray Damaso, say that you had been twenty years in\r\nthe town of San Diego and that you had left it? Wasn't your Reverence\r\nsatisfied with the town?\"\r\n\r\nAt this question, which was put in a very natural and almost\r\nnegligent tone, Fray Damaso suddenly lost all his merriment and stopped\r\nlaughing. \"No!\" he grunted dryly, and let himself back heavily against\r\nthe back of his chair.\r\n\r\nThe Dominican went on in a still more indifferent tone. \"It must be\r\npainful to leave a town where one has been for twenty years and which\r\nhe knows as well as the clothes he wears. I certainly was sorry to\r\nleave Kamiling and that after I had been there only a few months. But\r\nmy superiors did it for the good of the Orders for my own good.\"\r\n\r\nFray Damaso, for the first time that evening, seemed to be very\r\nthoughtful. Suddenly he brought his fist down on the arm of his chair\r\nand with a heavy breath exclaimed: \"Either Religion is a fact or it\r\nis not! That is, either the curates are free or they are not! The\r\ncountry is going to ruin, it is lost!\" And again he struck the arm\r\nof his chair.\r\n\r\nEverybody in the sala turned toward the group with astonished\r\nlooks. The Dominican raised his head to stare at the Franciscan from\r\nunder his glasses. The two foreigners paused a moment, stared with an\r\nexpression of mingled severity and reproof, then immediately continued\r\ntheir promenade.\r\n\r\n\"He's in a bad humor because you haven't treated him with deference,\"\r\nmurmured Señor Laruja into the ear of the rubicund youth.\r\n\r\n\"What does your Reverence mean? What's the trouble?\" inquired the\r\nDominican and the lieutenant at the same time, but in different tones.\r\n\r\n\"That's why so many calamities come! The ruling powers support\r\nheretics against the ministers of God!\" continued the Franciscan,\r\nraising his heavy fists.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" again inquired the frowning lieutenant, half\r\nrising from his chair.\r\n\r\n\"What do I mean?\" repeated Fray Damaso, raising his voice and facing\r\nthe lieutenant. \"I'll tell you what I mean. I, yes I, mean to say that\r\nwhen a priest throws out of his cemetery the corpse of a heretic,\r\nno one, not even the King himself, has any right to interfere and\r\nmuch less to impose any punishment! But a little General--a little\r\nGeneral Calamity--\"\r\n\r\n\"Padre, his Excellency is the Vice-Regal Patron!\" shouted the soldier,\r\nrising to his feet.\r\n\r\n\"Excellency! Vice-Regal Patron! What of that!\" retorted the Franciscan,\r\nalso rising. \"In other times he would have been dragged down a\r\nstaircase as the religious orders once did with the impious Governor\r\nBustamente. [22] Those were indeed the days of faith.\"\r\n\r\n\"I warn you that I can't permit this! His Excellency represents his\r\nMajesty the King!\"\r\n\r\n\"King or rook! What difference does that make? For us there is no\r\nking other than the legitimate [23]--\"\r\n\r\n\"Halt!\" shouted the lieutenant in a threatening tone, as if he were\r\ncommanding his soldiers. \"Either you withdraw what you have said or\r\ntomorrow I will report it to his Excellency!\"\r\n\r\n\"Go ahead--right now--go on!\" was the sarcastic rejoinder of Fray\r\nDamaso as he approached the officer with clenched fists. \"Do you think\r\nthat because I wear the cloth, I'm afraid? Go now, while I can lend\r\nyou my carriage!\"\r\n\r\nThe dispute was taking a ludicrous turn, but fortunately the\r\nDominican intervened. \"Gentlemen,\" he began in an authoritative\r\ntone and with the nasal twang that so well becomes the friars,\r\n\"you must not confuse things or seek for offenses where there are\r\nnone. We must distinguish in the words of Fray Damaso those of the\r\nman from those of the priest. The latter, as such, _per se_, can\r\nnever give offense, because they spring from absolute truth, while\r\nin those of the man there is a secondary distinction to be made:\r\nthose which he utters _ab irato_, those which he utters _ex ore_,\r\nbut not _in corde_, and those which he does utter _in corde_. These\r\nlast are the only ones that can really offend, and only according to\r\nwhether they preexisted as a motive _in mente_, or arose solely _per\r\naccidens_ in the heat of the discussion, if there really exist--\"\r\n\r\n\"But I, by _accidens_ and for my own part, understand his motives,\r\nPadre Sibyla,\" broke in the old soldier, who saw himself about to\r\nbe entangled in so many distinctions that he feared lest he might\r\nstill be held to blame. \"I understand the motives about which your\r\nReverence is going to make distinctions. During the absence of Padre\r\nDamaso from San Diego, his coadjutor buried the body of an extremely\r\nworthy individual--yes, sir, extremely worthy, for I had had dealings\r\nwith him many times and had been entertained in his house. What\r\nif he never went to confession, what does that matter? Neither do\r\nI go to confession! But to say that he committed suicide is a lie,\r\na slander! A man such as he was, who has a son upon whom he centers\r\nhis affection and hopes, a man who has faith in God, who recognizes\r\nhis duties to society, a just and honorable man, does not commit\r\nsuicide. This much I will say and will refrain from expressing the\r\nrest of my thoughts here, so please your Reverence.\"\r\n\r\nThen, turning his back on the Franciscan, he went on: \"Now then, this\r\npriest on his return to the town, after maltreating the poor coadjutor,\r\nhad the corpse dug up and taken away from the cemetery to be buried I\r\ndon't know where. The people of San Diego were cowardly enough not to\r\nprotest, although it is true that few knew of the outrage. The dead\r\nman had no relatives there and his only son was in Europe. But his\r\nExcellency learned of the affair and as he is an upright man asked\r\nfor some punishment--and Padre Damaso was transferred to a better\r\ntown. That's all there is to it. Now your Reverence can make your\r\ndistinctions.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he withdrew from the group.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry that I inadvertently brought up so delicate a subject,\"\r\nsaid Padre Sibyla sadly. \"But, after all, if there has been a gain\r\nin the change of towns--\"\r\n\r\n\"How is there to be a gain? And what of all the things that\r\nare lost in moving, the letters, and the--and everything that is\r\nmislaid?\" interrupted Fray Damaso, stammering in the vain effort to\r\ncontrol his anger.\r\n\r\nLittle by little the party resumed its former tranquillity. Other\r\nguests had come in, among them a lame old Spaniard of mild and\r\ninoffensive aspect leaning on the arm of an elderly Filipina,\r\nwho was resplendent in frizzes and paint and a European gown. The\r\ngroup welcomed them heartily, and Doctor De Espadaña and his\r\nseñora, the _Doctora_ Doña Victorina, took their seats among our\r\nacquaintances. Some newspaper reporters and shopkeepers greeted one\r\nanother and moved about aimlessly without knowing just what to do.\r\n\r\n\"But can you tell me, Señor Laruja, what kind of man our host\r\nis?\" inquired the rubicund youth. \"I haven't been introduced to\r\nhim yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"They say that he has gone out. I haven't seen him either.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no need of introductions here,\" volunteered Fray\r\nDamaso. \"Santiago is made of the right stuff.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, he's not the man who invented gunpowder,\" [24] added Laruja.\r\n\r\n\"You too, Señor Laruja,\" exclaimed Doña Victorina in mild reproach,\r\nas she fanned herself. \"How could the poor man invent gunpowder if,\r\nas is said, the Chinese invented it centuries ago?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Chinese! Are you crazy?\" cried Fray Damaso. \"Out with you! A\r\nFranciscan, one of my Order, Fray What-do-you-call-him Savalls,\r\n[25] invented it in the--ah the seventh century!\"\r\n\r\n\"A Franciscan? Well, he must have been a missionary in China, that\r\nPadre Savalls,\" replied the lady, who did not thus easily part from\r\nher beliefs.\r\n\r\n\"Schwartz, [26] perhaps you mean, señora,\" said Fray Sibyla, without\r\nlooking at her.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. Fray Damaso said a Franciscan and I was only repeating.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Savalls or Chevas, what does it matter? The difference of\r\na letter doesn't make him a Chinaman,\" replied the Franciscan in\r\nbad humor.\r\n\r\n\"And in the fourteenth century, not the seventh,\" added the Dominican\r\nin a tone of correction, as if to mortify the pride of the other friar.\r\n\r\n\"Well, neither does a century more or less make him a Dominican.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't get angry, your Reverence,\" admonished Padre Sibyla,\r\nsmiling. \"So much the better that he did invent it so as to save his\r\nbrethren the trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"And did you say, Padre Sibyla, that it was in the fourteenth\r\ncentury?\" asked Doña Victorina with great interest. \"Was that before\r\nor after Christ?\"\r\n\r\nFortunately for the individual questioned, two persons entered\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nCrisostomo Ibarra\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not two beautiful and well-gowned young women that attracted\r\nthe attention of all, even including Fray Sibyla, nor was it his\r\nExcellency the Captain-General with his staff, that the lieutenant\r\nshould start from his abstraction and take a couple of steps forward,\r\nor that Fray Damaso should look as if turned to stone; it was simply\r\nthe original of the oil-painting leading by the hand a young man\r\ndressed in deep mourning.\r\n\r\n\"Good evening, gentlemen! Good evening, Padre!\" were the greetings\r\nof Capitan Tiago as he kissed the hands of the priests, who forgot\r\nto bestow upon him their benediction. The Dominican had taken off\r\nhis glasses to stare at the newly arrived youth, while Fray Damaso\r\nwas pale and unnaturally wide-eyed.\r\n\r\n\"I have the honor of presenting to you Don Crisostomo Ibarra, the son\r\nof my deceased friend,\" went on Capitan Tiago. \"The young gentleman\r\nhas just arrived from Europe and I went to meet him.\"\r\n\r\nAt the mention of the name exclamations were heard. The lieutenant\r\nforgot to pay his respects to his host and approached the young man,\r\nlooking him over from head to foot. The young man himself at that\r\nmoment was exchanging the conventional greetings with all in the group,\r\nnor did there seem to be any thing extraordinary about him except\r\nhis mourning garments in the center of that brilliantly lighted\r\nroom. Yet in spite of them his remarkable stature, his features,\r\nand his movements breathed forth an air of healthy youthfulness in\r\nwhich both body and mind had equally developed. There might have been\r\nnoticed in his frank, pleasant face some faint traces of Spanish\r\nblood showing through a beautiful brown color, slightly flushed at\r\nthe cheeks as a result perhaps of his residence in cold countries.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" he exclaimed with joyful surprise, \"the curate of my native\r\ntown! Padre Damaso, my father's intimate friend!\"\r\n\r\nEvery look in the room was directed toward the Franciscan, who made\r\nno movement.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, perhaps I'm mistaken,\" added Ibarra, embarrassed.\r\n\r\n\"You are not mistaken,\" the friar was at last able to articulate in a\r\nchanged voice, \"but your father was never an intimate friend of mine.\"\r\n\r\nIbarra slowly withdrew his extended hand, looking greatly surprised,\r\nand turned to encounter the gloomy gaze of the lieutenant fixed on him.\r\n\r\n\"Young man, are you the son of Don Rafael Ibarra?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nThe youth bowed. Fray Damaso partly rose in his chair and stared\r\nfixedly at the lieutenant.\r\n\r\n\"Welcome back to your country! And may you be happier in it than your\r\nfather was!\" exclaimed the officer in a trembling voice. \"I knew him\r\nwell and can say that he was one of the worthiest and most honorable\r\nmen in the Philippines.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" replied Ibarra, deeply moved, \"the praise you bestow upon my\r\nfather removes my doubts about the manner of his death, of which I,\r\nhis son, am yet ignorant.\"\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the old soldier filled with tears and turning away hastily\r\nhe withdrew. The young man thus found himself alone in the center\r\nof the room. His host having disappeared, he saw no one who might\r\nintroduce him to the young ladies, many of whom were watching him\r\nwith interest. After a few moments of hesitation he started toward\r\nthem in a simple and natural manner.\r\n\r\n\"Allow me,\" he said, \"to overstep the rules of strict etiquette. It\r\nhas been seven years since I have been in my own country and upon\r\nreturning to it I cannot suppress my admiration and refrain from\r\npaying my respects to its most precious ornaments, the ladies.\"\r\n\r\nBut as none of them ventured a reply, he found himself obliged to\r\nretire. He then turned toward a group of men who, upon seeing him\r\napproach, arranged themselves in a semicircle.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" he addressed them, \"it is a custom in Germany,\r\nwhen a stranger finds himself at a function and there is no one to\r\nintroduce him to those present, that he give his name and so introduce\r\nhimself. Allow me to adopt this usage here, not to introduce foreign\r\ncustoms when our own are so beautiful, but because I find myself driven\r\nto it by necessity. I have already paid my respects to the skies and\r\nto the ladies of my native land; now I wish to greet its citizens,\r\nmy fellow-countrymen. Gentlemen, my name is Juan Crisostomo Ibarra\r\ny Magsalin.\"\r\n\r\nThe others gave their names, more or less obscure, and unimportant\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n\"My name is A----,\" said one youth dryly, as he made a slight bow.\r\n\r\n\"Then I have the honor of addressing the poet whose works have done\r\nso much to keep up my enthusiasm for my native land. It is said that\r\nyou do not write any more, but I could not learn the reason.\"\r\n\r\n\"The reason? Because one does not seek inspiration in order to debase\r\nhimself and lie. One writer has been imprisoned for having put a\r\nvery obvious truth into verse. They may have called me a poet but\r\nthey sha'n't call me a fool.\"\r\n\r\n\"And may I enquire what that truth was?\"\r\n\r\n\"He said that the lion's son is also a lion. He came very near to being\r\nexiled for it,\" replied the strange youth, moving away from the group.\r\n\r\nA man with a smiling face, dressed in the fashion of the natives\r\nof the country, with diamond studs in his shirt-bosom, came up at\r\nthat moment almost running. He went directly to Ibarra and grasped\r\nhis hand, saying, \"Señor Ibarra, I've been eager to make your\r\nacquaintance. Capitan Tiago is a friend of mine and I knew your\r\nrespected father. I am known as Capitan Tinong and live in Tondo,\r\nwhere you will always be welcome. I hope that you will honor me with a\r\nvisit. Come and dine with us tomorrow.\" He smiled and rubbed his hands.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" replied Ibarra, warmly, charmed with such amiability,\r\n\"but tomorrow morning I must leave for San Diego.\"\r\n\r\n\"How unfortunate! Then it will be on your return.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dinner is served!\" announced a waiter from the café La Campana, and\r\nthe guests began to file out toward the table, the women, especially\r\nthe Filipinas, with great hesitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nThe Dinner\r\n\r\n\r\n    Jele, jele, bago quiere. [27]\r\n\r\n\r\nFray Sibyla seemed to be very content as he moved along tranquilly with\r\nthe look of disdain no longer playing about his thin, refined lips. He\r\neven condescended to speak to the lame doctor, De Espadaña, who\r\nanswered in monosyllables only, as he was somewhat of a stutterer. The\r\nFranciscan was in a frightful humor, kicking at the chairs and even\r\nelbowing a cadet out of his way. The lieutenant was grave while the\r\nothers talked vivaciously, praising the magnificence of the table. Doña\r\nVictorina, however, was just turning up her nose in disdain when she\r\nsuddenly became as furious as a trampled serpent--the lieutenant had\r\nstepped on the train of her gown.\r\n\r\n\"Haven't you any eyes?\" she demanded.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, señora, two better than yours, but the fact is that I was\r\nadmiring your frizzes,\" retorted the rather ungallant soldier as he\r\nmoved away from her.\r\n\r\nAs if from instinct the two friars both started toward the head of the\r\ntable, perhaps from habit, and then, as might have been expected, the\r\nsame thing happened that occurs with the competitors for a university\r\nposition, who openly exalt the qualifications and superiority of their\r\nopponents, later giving to understand that just the contrary was meant,\r\nand who murmur and grumble when they do not receive the appointment.\r\n\r\n\"For you, Fray Damaso.\"\r\n\r\n\"For you, Fray Sibyla.\"\r\n\r\n\"An older friend of the family--confessor of the deceased lady--age,\r\ndignity, and authority--\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so very old, either! On the other hand, you are the curate of\r\nthe district,\" replied Fray Damaso sourly, without taking his hand\r\nfrom the back of the chair.\r\n\r\n\"Since you command it, I obey,\" concluded Fray Sibyla, disposing\r\nhimself to take the seat.\r\n\r\n\"I don't command it!\" protested the Franciscan. \"I don't command it!\"\r\n\r\nFray Sibyla was about to seat himself without paying any more attention\r\nto these protests when his eyes happened to encounter those of the\r\nlieutenant. According to clerical opinion in the Philippines, the\r\nhighest secular official is inferior to a friar-cook: _cedant arma\r\ntogae_, said Cicero in the Senate--_cedant arma cottae_, say the\r\nfriars in the Philippines. [28]\r\n\r\nBut Fray Sibyla was a well-bred person, so he said, \"Lieutenant, here\r\nwe are in the world and not in the church. The seat of honor belongs\r\nto you.\" To judge from the tone of his voice, however, even in the\r\nworld it really did belong to him, and the lieutenant, either to keep\r\nout of trouble or to avoid sitting between two friars, curtly declined.\r\n\r\nNone of the claimants had given a thought to their host. Ibarra\r\nnoticed him watching the scene with a smile of satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"How's this, Don Santiago, aren't you going to sit down with us?\"\r\n\r\nBut all the seats were occupied; Lucullus was not to sup in the house\r\nof Lucullus.\r\n\r\n\"Sit still, don't get up!\" said Capitan Tiago, placing his hand on\r\nthe young man's shoulder. \"This fiesta is for the special purpose\r\nof giving thanks to the Virgin for your safe arrival. _Oy!_ Bring\r\non the _tinola!_ I ordered _tinola_ as you doubtless have not tasted\r\nany for so long a time.\"\r\n\r\nA large steaming tureen was brought in. The Dominican, after muttering\r\nthe benedicite, to which scarcely any one knew how to respond, began\r\nto serve the contents. But whether from carelessness or other cause,\r\nPadre Damaso received a plate in which a bare neck and a tough wing\r\nof chicken floated about in a large quantity of soup amid lumps of\r\nsquash, while the others were eating legs and breasts, especially\r\nIbarra, to whose lot fell the second joints. Observing all this, the\r\nFranciscan mashed up some pieces of squash, barely tasted the soup,\r\ndropped his spoon noisily, and roughly pushed his plate away. The\r\nDominican was very busy talking to the rubicund youth.\r\n\r\n\"How long have you been away from the country?\" Laruja asked Ibarra.\r\n\r\n\"Almost seven years.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you have probably forgotten all about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite the contrary. Even if my country does seem to have forgotten\r\nme, I have always thought about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you mean that it has forgotten you?\" inquired the rubicund\r\nyouth.\r\n\r\n\"I mean that it has been a year since I have received any news from\r\nhere, so that I find myself a stranger who does not yet know how and\r\nwhen his father died.\"\r\n\r\nThis statement drew a sudden exclamation from the lieutenant.\r\n\r\n\"And where were you that you didn't telegraph?\" asked Doña\r\nVictorina. \"When we were married we telegraphed to the Peñinsula.\" [29]\r\n\r\n\"Señora, for the past two years I have been in the northern part of\r\nEurope, in Germany and Russian Poland.\"\r\n\r\nDoctor De Espadaña, who until now had not ventured upon any\r\nconversation, thought this a good opportunity to say something. \"I--I\r\nknew in S-spain a P-pole from W-warsaw, c-called S-stadtnitzki, if\r\nI r-remember c-correctly. P-perhaps you s-saw him?\" he asked timidly\r\nand almost blushingly.\r\n\r\n\"It's very likely,\" answered Ibarra in a friendly manner, \"but just\r\nat this moment I don't recall him.\"\r\n\r\n\"B-but you c-couldn't have c-confused him with any one else,\" went\r\non the Doctor, taking courage. \"He was r-ruddy as gold and t-talked\r\nSpanish very b-badly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Those are good clues, but unfortunately while there I talked Spanish\r\nonly in a few consulates.\"\r\n\r\n\"How then did you get along?\" asked the wondering Doña Victorina.\r\n\r\n\"The language of the country served my needs, madam.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you also speak English?\" inquired the Dominican, who had been in\r\nHongkong, and who was a master of pidgin-English, that adulteration\r\nof Shakespeare's tongue used by the sons of the Celestial Empire.\r\n\r\n\"I stayed in England a year among people who talked nothing but\r\nEnglish.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which country of Europe pleased you the most?\" asked the rubicund\r\nyouth.\r\n\r\n\"After Spain, my second fatherland, any country of free Europe.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you who seem to have traveled so much, tell us what do you\r\nconsider the most notable thing that you have seen?\" inquired Laruja.\r\n\r\nIbarra appeared to reflect. \"Notable--in what way?\"\r\n\r\n\"For example, in regard to the life of the people--the social,\r\npolitical, religious life--in general, in its essential features--as\r\na whole.\"\r\n\r\nIbarra paused thoughtfully before replying. \"Frankly, I like everything\r\nin those people, setting aside the national pride of each one. But\r\nbefore visiting a country, I tried to familiarize myself with its\r\nhistory, its Exodus, if I may so speak, and afterwards I found\r\neverything quite natural. I have observed that the prosperity or\r\nmisery of each people is in direct proportion to its liberties or its\r\nprejudices and, accordingly, to the sacrifices or the selfishness of\r\nits forefathers.\"\r\n\r\n\"And haven't you observed anything more than that?\" broke in the\r\nFranciscan with a sneer. Since the beginning of the dinner he had not\r\nuttered a single word, his whole attention having been taking up,\r\nno doubt, with the food. \"It wasn't worth while to squander your\r\nfortune to learn so trifling a thing. Any schoolboy knows that.\"\r\n\r\nIbarra was placed in an embarrassing position, and the rest looked\r\nfrom one to the other as if fearing a disagreeable scene. He was\r\nabout to say, \"The dinner is nearly over and his Reverence is now\r\nsatiated,\" but restrained himself and merely remarked to the others,\r\n\"Gentlemen, don't be surprised at the familiarity with which our former\r\ncurate treats me. He treated me so when I was a child, and the years\r\nseem to make no difference in his Reverence. I appreciate it, too,\r\nbecause it recalls the days when his Reverence visited our home and\r\nhonored my father's table.\"\r\n\r\nThe Dominican glanced furtively at the Franciscan, who was trembling\r\nvisibly. Ibarra continued as he rose from the table: \"You will now\r\npermit me to retire, since, as I have just arrived and must go away\r\ntomorrow morning, there remain some important business matters for me\r\nto attend to. The principal part of the dinner is over and I drink\r\nbut little wine and seldom touch cordials. Gentlemen, all for Spain\r\nand the Philippines!\" Saying this, he drained his glass, which he had\r\nnot before touched. The old lieutenant silently followed his example.\r\n\r\n\"Don't go!\" whispered Capitan Tiago. \"Maria Clara will be here. Isabel\r\nhas gone to get her. The new curate of your town, who is a saint,\r\nis also coming.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll call tomorrow before starting. I've a very important visit to\r\nmake now.\" With this he went away.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Franciscan had recovered himself. \"Do you see?\" he\r\nsaid to the rubicund youth, at the same time flourishing his dessert\r\nspoon. \"That comes from pride. They can't stand to have the curate\r\ncorrect them. They even think that they are respectable persons. It's\r\nthe evil result of sending young men to Europe. The government ought\r\nto prohibit it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how about the lieutenant?\" Doña Victorina chimed in upon the\r\nFranciscan, \"he didn't get the frown off his face the whole evening. He\r\ndid well to leave us so old and still only a lieutenant!\" The lady\r\ncould not forget the allusion to her frizzes and the trampled ruffles\r\nof her gown.\r\n\r\nThat night the rubicund youth wrote down, among other things, the\r\nfollowing title for a chapter in his _Colonial Studies_: \"Concerning\r\nthe manner in which the neck and wing of a chicken in a friar's plate\r\nof soup may disturb the merriment of a feast.\" Among his notes there\r\nappeared these observations: \"In the Philippines the most unnecessary\r\nperson at a dinner is he who gives it, for they are quite capable of\r\nbeginning by throwing the host into the street and then everything\r\nwill go on smoothly. Under present conditions it would perhaps be a\r\ngood thing not to allow the Filipinos to leave the country, and even\r\nnot to teach them to read.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nHeretic and Filibuster\r\n\r\n\r\nIbarra stood undecided for a moment. The night breeze, which during\r\nthose months blows cool enough in Manila, seemed to drive from his\r\nforehead the light cloud that had darkened it. He took off his hat and\r\ndrew a deep breath. Carriages flashed by, public rigs moved along at a\r\nsleepy pace, pedestrians of many nationalities were passing. He walked\r\nalong at that irregular pace which indicates thoughtful abstraction\r\nor freedom from care, directing his steps toward Binondo Plaza and\r\nlooking about him as if to recall the place. There were the same\r\nstreets and the identical houses with their white and blue walls,\r\nwhitewashed, or frescoed in bad imitation of granite; the church\r\ncontinued to show its illuminated clock face; there were the same\r\nChinese shops with their soiled curtains and their iron gratings, in\r\none of which was a bar that he, in imitation of the street urchins of\r\nManila, had twisted one night; it was still unstraightened. \"How slowly\r\neverything moves,\" he murmured as he turned into Calle Sacristia. The\r\nice-cream venders were repeating the same shrill cry, \"_Sorbeteee!_\"\r\nwhile the smoky lamps still lighted the identical Chinese stands and\r\nthose of the old women who sold candy and fruit.\r\n\r\n\"Wonderful!\" he exclaimed. \"There's the same Chinese who was here\r\nseven years ago, and that old woman--the very same! It might be said\r\nthat tonight I've dreamed of a seven years' journey in Europe. Good\r\nheavens, that pavement is still in the same unrepaired condition\r\nas when I left!\" True it was that the stones of the sidewalk on the\r\ncorner of San Jacinto and Sacristia were still loose.\r\n\r\nWhile he was meditating upon this marvel of the city's stability in\r\na country where everything is so unstable, a hand was placed lightly\r\non his shoulder. He raised his head to see the old lieutenant gazing\r\nat him with something like a smile in place of the hard expression\r\nand the frown which usually characterized him.\r\n\r\n\"Young man, be careful! Learn from your father!\" was the abrupt\r\ngreeting of the old soldier.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, but you seem to have thought a great deal of my father. Can\r\nyou tell me how he died?\" asked Ibarra, staring at him.\r\n\r\n\"What! Don't you know about it?\" asked the officer.\r\n\r\n\"I asked Don Santiago about it, but he wouldn't promise to tell me\r\nuntil tomorrow. Perhaps you know?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should say I do, as does everybody else. He died in prison!\"\r\n\r\nThe young man stepped backward a pace and gazed searchingly at the\r\nlieutenant. \"In prison? Who died in prison?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your father, man, since he was in confinement,\" was the somewhat\r\nsurprised answer.\r\n\r\n\"My father--in prison--confined in a prison? What are you talking\r\nabout? Do you know who my father was? Are you--?\" demanded the young\r\nman, seizing the officer's arm.\r\n\r\n\"I rather think that I'm not mistaken. He was Don Rafael Ibarra.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Don Rafael Ibarra,\" echoed the youth weakly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I thought you knew about it,\" muttered the soldier in a\r\ntone of compassion as he saw what was passing in Ibarra's mind. \"I\r\nsupposed that you--but be brave! Here one cannot be honest and keep\r\nout of jail.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must believe that you are not joking with me,\" replied Ibarra in\r\na weak voice, after a few moments' silence. \"Can you tell me why he\r\nwas in prison?\"\r\n\r\nThe old man seemed to be perplexed. \"It's strange to me that your\r\nfamily affairs were not made known to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"His last letter, a year ago, said that I should not be uneasy if\r\nhe did not write, as he was very busy. He charged me to continue my\r\nstudies and--sent me his blessing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then he wrote that letter to you just before he died. It will soon\r\nbe a year since we buried him.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why was my father a prisoner?\"\r\n\r\n\"For a very honorable reason. But come with me to the barracks and\r\nI'll tell you as we go along. Take my arm.\"\r\n\r\nThey moved along for some time in silence. The elder seemed to be in\r\ndeep thought and to be seeking inspiration from his goatee, which he\r\nstroked continually.\r\n\r\n\"As you well know,\" he began, \"your father was the richest man in\r\nthe province, and while many loved and respected him, there were\r\nalso some who envied and hated him. We Spaniards who come to the\r\nPhilippines are unfortunately not all we ought to be. I say this as\r\nmuch on account of one of your ancestors as on account of your father's\r\nenemies. The continual changes, the corruption in the higher circles,\r\nthe favoritism, the low cost and the shortness of the journey, are to\r\nblame for it all. The worst characters of the Peninsula come here,\r\nand even if a good man does come, the country soon ruins him. So it\r\nwas that your father had a number of enemies among the curates and\r\nother Spaniards.\"\r\n\r\nHere he hesitated for a while. \"Some months after your departure the\r\ntroubles with Padre Damaso began, but I am unable to explain the real\r\ncause of them. Fray Damaso accused him of not coming to confession,\r\nalthough he had not done so formerly and they had nevertheless been\r\ngood friends, as you may still remember. Moreover, Don Rafael was a\r\nvery upright man, more so than many of those who regularly attend\r\nconfession and than the confessors themselves. He had framed for\r\nhimself a rigid morality and often said to me, when he talked of\r\nthese troubles, 'Señor Guevara, do you believe that God will pardon\r\nany crime, a murder for instance, solely by a man's telling it to a\r\npriest--a man after all and one whose duty it is to keep quiet about\r\nit--by his fearing that he will roast in hell as a penance--by being\r\ncowardly and certainly shameless into the bargain? I have another\r\nconception of God,' he used to say, 'for in my opinion one evil does\r\nnot correct another, nor is a crime to be expiated by vain lamentings\r\nor by giving alms to the Church. Take this example: if I have killed\r\nthe father of a family, if I have made of a woman a sorrowing widow\r\nand destitute orphans of some happy children, have I satisfied eternal\r\nJustice by letting myself be hanged, or by entrusting my secret to one\r\nwho is obliged to guard it for me, or by giving alms to priests who\r\nare least in need of them, or by buying indulgences and lamenting\r\nnight and day? What of the widow and the orphans? My conscience\r\ntells me that I should try to take the place of him whom I killed,\r\nthat I should dedicate my whole life to the welfare of the family\r\nwhose misfortunes I caused. But even so, who can replace the love of\r\na husband and a father?' Thus your father reasoned and by this strict\r\nstandard of conduct regulated all his actions, so that it can be said\r\nthat he never injured anybody. On the contrary, he endeavored by his\r\ngood deeds to wipe out some injustices which he said your ancestors\r\nhad committed. But to get back to his troubles with the curate--these\r\ntook on a serious aspect. Padre Damaso denounced him from the pulpit,\r\nand that he did not expressly name him was a miracle, since anything\r\nmight have been expected of such a character. I foresaw that sooner\r\nor later the affair would have serious results.\"\r\n\r\nAgain the old lieutenant paused. \"There happened to be wandering about\r\nthe province an ex-artilleryman who has been discharged from the army\r\non account of his stupidity and ignorance. As the man had to live and\r\nhe was not permitted to engage in manual labor, which would injure\r\nour prestige, he somehow or other obtained a position as collector of\r\nthe tax on vehicles. The poor devil had no education at all, a fact of\r\nwhich the natives soon became aware, as it was a marvel for them to see\r\na Spaniard who didn't know how to read and write. Every one ridiculed\r\nhim and the payment of the tax was the occasion of broad smiles. He\r\nknew that he was an object of ridicule and this tended to sour his\r\ndisposition even more, rough and bad as it had formerly been. They\r\nwould purposely hand him the papers upside down to see his efforts\r\nto read them, and wherever he found a blank space he would scribble\r\na lot of pothooks which rather fitly passed for his signature. The\r\nnatives mocked while they paid him. He swallowed his pride and made\r\nthe collections, but was in such a state of mind that he had no respect\r\nfor any one. He even came to have some hard words with your father.\r\n\r\n\"One day it happened that he was in a shop turning a document over and\r\nover in the effort to get it straight when a schoolboy began to make\r\nsigns to his companions and to point laughingly at the collector with\r\nhis finger. The fellow heard the laughter and saw the joke reflected\r\nin the solemn faces of the bystanders. He lost his patience and,\r\nturning quickly, started to chase the boys, who ran away shouting _ba,\r\nbe, bi, bo, bu_. [30] Blind with rage and unable to catch them, he\r\nthrew his cane and struck one of the boys on the head, knocking him\r\ndown. He ran up and began to kick the fallen boy, and none of those\r\nwho had been laughing had the courage to interfere. Unfortunately,\r\nyour father happened to come along just at that time. He ran forward\r\nindignantly, caught the collector by the arm, and reprimanded him\r\nseverely. The artilleryman, who was no doubt beside himself with rage,\r\nraised his hand, but your father was too quick for him, and with the\r\nstrength of a descendant of the Basques--some say that he struck him,\r\nothers that he merely pushed him, but at any rate the man staggered\r\nand fell a little way off, striking his head against a stone. Don\r\nRafael quietly picked the wounded boy up and carried him to the town\r\nhall. The artilleryman bled freely from the mouth and died a few\r\nmoments later without recovering consciousness.\r\n\r\n\"As was to be expected, the authorities intervened and arrested\r\nyour father. All his hidden enemies at once rose up and false\r\naccusations came from all sides. He was accused of being a heretic\r\nand a filibuster. To be a heretic is a great danger anywhere,\r\nbut especially so at that time when the province was governed by an\r\nalcalde who made a great show of his piety, who with his servants used\r\nto recite his rosary in the church in a loud voice, perhaps that all\r\nmight hear and pray with him. But to be a filibuster is worse than\r\nto be a heretic and to kill three or four tax-collectors who know\r\nhow to read, write, and attend to business. Every one abandoned him,\r\nand his books and papers were seized. He was accused of subscribing to\r\n_El Correo de Ultramar_, and to newspapers from Madrid, of having sent\r\nyou to Germany, of having in his possession letters and a photograph\r\nof a priest who had been legally executed, and I don't know what\r\nnot. Everything served as an accusation, even the fact that he, a\r\ndescendant of Peninsulars, wore a camisa. Had it been any one but\r\nyour father, it is likely that he would soon have been set free,\r\nas there was a physician who ascribed the death of the unfortunate\r\ncollector to a hemorrhage. But his wealth, his confidence in the law,\r\nand his hatred of everything that was not legal and just, wrought his\r\nundoing. In spite of my repugnance to asking for mercy from any one,\r\nI applied personally to the Captain-General--the predecessor of our\r\npresent one--and urged upon him that there could not be anything of\r\nthe filibuster about a man who took up with all the Spaniards, even\r\nthe poor emigrants, and gave them food and shelter, and in whose\r\nveins yet flowed the generous blood of Spain. It was in vain that\r\nI pledged my life and swore by my poverty and my military honor. I\r\nsucceeded only in being coldly listened to and roughly sent away with\r\nthe epithet of _chiflado_.\" [31]\r\n\r\nThe old man paused to take a deep breath, and after noticing the\r\nsilence of his companion, who was listening with averted face,\r\ncontinued: \"At your father's request I prepared the defense in the\r\ncase. I went first to the celebrated Filipino lawyer, young A----,\r\nbut he refused to take the case. 'I should lose it,' he told me,\r\n'and my defending him would furnish the motive for another charge\r\nagainst him and perhaps one against me. Go to Señor M----, who is a\r\nforceful and fluent speaker and a Peninsular of great influence.' I\r\ndid so, and the noted lawyer took charge of the case, and conducted it\r\nwith mastery and brilliance. But your father's enemies were numerous,\r\nsome of them hidden and unknown. False witnesses abounded, and their\r\ncalumnies, which under other circumstances would have melted away\r\nbefore a sarcastic phrase from the defense, here assumed shape and\r\nsubstance. If the lawyer succeeded in destroying the force of their\r\ntestimony by making them contradict each other and even perjure\r\nthemselves, new charges were at once preferred. They accused him of\r\nhaving illegally taken possession of a great deal of land and demanded\r\ndamages. They said that he maintained relations with the tulisanes in\r\norder that his crops and animals might not be molested by them. At\r\nlast the case became so confused that at the end of a year no one\r\nunderstood it. The alcalde had to leave and there came in his place\r\none who had the reputation of being honest, but unfortunately he stayed\r\nonly a few months, and his successor was too fond of good horses.\r\n\r\n\"The sufferings, the worries, the hard life in the prison, or the pain\r\nof seeing so much ingratitude, broke your father's iron constitution\r\nand he fell ill with that malady which only the tomb can cure. When\r\nthe case was almost finished and he was about to be acquitted of the\r\ncharge of being an enemy of the fatherland and of being the murderer\r\nof the tax-collector, he died in the prison with no one at his side. I\r\narrived just in time to see him breathe his last.\"\r\n\r\nThe old lieutenant became silent, but still Ibarra said nothing. They\r\nhad arrived meanwhile at the door of the barracks, so the soldier\r\nstopped and said, as he grasped the youth's hand, \"Young man, for\r\ndetails ask Capitan Tiago. Now, good night, as I must return to duty\r\nand see that all's well.\"\r\n\r\nSilently, but with great feeling, Ibarra shook the lieutenant's bony\r\nhand and followed him with his eyes until he disappeared. Then he\r\nturned slowly and signaled to a passing carriage. \"To Lala's Hotel,\"\r\nwas the direction he gave in a scarcely audible voice.\r\n\r\n\"This fellow must have just got out of jail,\" thought the cochero as\r\nhe whipped up his horses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nA Star in a Dark Night\r\n\r\n\r\nIbarra went to his room, which overlooked the river, and dropping\r\ninto a chair gazed out into the vast expanse of the heavens spread\r\nbefore him through the open window. The house on the opposite bank\r\nwas profusely lighted, and gay strains of music, largely from stringed\r\ninstruments, were borne across the river even to his room.\r\n\r\nIf the young man had been less preoccupied, if he had had more\r\ncuriosity and had cared to see with his opera glasses what was going\r\non in that atmosphere of light, he would have been charmed with one of\r\nthose magical and fantastic spectacles, the like of which is sometimes\r\nseen in the great theaters of Europe. To the subdued strains of the\r\norchestra there seems to appear in the midst of a shower of light, a\r\ncascade of gold and diamonds in an Oriental setting, a deity wrapped\r\nin misty gauze, a sylph enveloped in a luminous halo, who moves\r\nforward apparently without touching the floor. In her presence the\r\nflowers bloom, the dance awakens, the music bursts forth, and troops\r\nof devils, nymphs, satyrs, demons, angels, shepherds and shepherdesses,\r\ndance, shake their tambourines, and whirl about in rhythmic evolutions,\r\neach one placing some tribute at the feet of the goddess. Ibarra would\r\nhave seen a beautiful and graceful maiden, clothed in the picturesque\r\ngarments of the daughters of the Philippines, standing in the center\r\nOf a semicircle made up of every class of people, Chinese, Spaniards,\r\nFilipinos, soldiers, curates, old men and young, all gesticulating\r\nand moving about in a lively manner. Padre Damaso stood at the side\r\nof the beauty, smiling like one especially blessed. Fray Sibyla--yes,\r\nFray Sibyla himself--was talking to her. Doña Victorina was arranging\r\nin the magnificent hair of the maiden a string of pearls and diamonds\r\nwhich threw out all the beautiful tints of the rainbow. She was white,\r\nperhaps too much so, and whenever she raised her downcast eyes there\r\nshone forth a spotless soul. When she smiled so as to show her small\r\nwhite teeth the beholder realized that the rose is only a flower\r\nand ivory but the elephant's tusk. From out the filmy piña draperies\r\naround her white and shapely neck there blinked, as the Tagalogs say,\r\nthe bright eyes of a collar of diamonds. One man only in all the crowd\r\nseemed insensible to her radiant influence--a young Franciscan, thin,\r\nwasted, and pale, who watched her from a distance, motionless as a\r\nstatue and scarcely breathing.\r\n\r\nBut Ibarra saw nothing of all this--his eyes were fixed on other\r\nthings. A small space was enclosed by four bare and grimy walls, in\r\none of which was an iron grating. On the filthy and loathsome floor\r\nwas a mat upon which an old man lay alone in the throes of death,\r\nan old man breathing with difficulty and turning his head from side\r\nto side as amid his tears he uttered a name. The old man was alone,\r\nbut from time to time a groan or the rattle of a chain was heard on\r\nthe other side of the wall. Far away there was a merry feast, almost\r\nan orgy; a youth was laughing, shouting, and pouring wine upon the\r\nflowers amid the applause and drunken laughter of his companions. The\r\nold man had the features of _his_ father, the youth was himself, and\r\nthe name that the old man uttered with tears was _his own_ name! This\r\nwas what the wretched young man saw before him. The lights in the\r\nhouse opposite were extinguished, the music and the noises ceased,\r\nbut Ibarra still heard the anguished cry of his father calling upon\r\nhis son in the hour of his death.\r\n\r\nSilence had now blown its hollow breath over the city, and all\r\nthings seemed to sleep in the embrace of nothingness. The cock-crow\r\nalternated with the strokes of the clocks in the church towers and\r\nthe mournful cries of the weary sentinels. A waning moon began to\r\nappear, and everything seemed to be at rest; even Ibarra himself,\r\nworn out by his sad thoughts or by his journey, now slept.\r\n\r\nOnly the young Franciscan whom we saw not so long ago standing\r\nmotionless and silent in the midst of the gaiety of the ballroom slept\r\nnot, but kept vigil. In his cell, with his elbow upon the window\r\nsill and his pale, worn cheek resting on the palm of his hand, he\r\nwas gazing silently into the distance where a bright star glittered\r\nin the dark sky. The star paled and disappeared, the dim light of the\r\nwaning moon faded, but the friar did not move from his place--he was\r\ngazing out over the field of Bagumbayan and the sleeping sea at the\r\nfar horizon wrapped in the morning mist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nCapitan Tiago\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThy will be done on earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile our characters are deep in slumber or busy with their breakfasts,\r\nlet us turn our attention to Capitan Tiago. We have never had the\r\nhonor of being his guest, so it is neither our right nor our duty to\r\npass him by slightingly, even under the stress of important events.\r\n\r\nLow in stature, with a clear complexion, a corpulent figure and a\r\nfull face, thanks to the liberal supply of fat which according to his\r\nadmirers was the gift of Heaven and which his enemies averred was the\r\nblood of the poor, Capitan Tiago appeared to be younger than he really\r\nwas; he might have been thought between thirty and thirty-five years of\r\nage. At the time of our story his countenance always wore a sanctified\r\nlook; his little round head, covered with ebony-black hair cut long in\r\nfront and short behind, was reputed to contain many things of weight;\r\nhis eyes, small but with no Chinese slant, never varied in expression;\r\nhis nose was slender and not at all inclined to flatness; and if his\r\nmouth had not been disfigured by the immoderate use of tobacco and\r\nbuyo, which, when chewed and gathered in one cheek, marred the symmetry\r\nof his features, we would say that he might properly have considered\r\nhimself a handsome man and have passed for such. Yet in spite of this\r\nbad habit he kept marvelously white both his natural teeth and also\r\nthe two which the dentist furnished him at twelve pesos each.\r\n\r\nHe was considered one of the richest landlords in Binondo and a\r\nplanter of some importance by reason of his estates in Pampanga and\r\nLaguna, principally in the town of San Diego, the income from which\r\nincreased with each year. San Diego, on account of its agreeable\r\nbaths, its famous cockpit, and his cherished memories of the place,\r\nwas his favorite town, so that he spent at least two months of the year\r\nthere. His holdings of real estate in the city were large, and it is\r\nsuperfluous to state that the opium monopoly controlled by him and a\r\nChinese brought in large profits. They also had the lucrative contract\r\nof feeding the prisoners in Bilibid and furnished zacate to many of the\r\nstateliest establishments in Manila u through the medium of contracts,\r\nof course. Standing well with all the authorities, clever, cunning,\r\nand even bold in speculating upon the wants of others, he was the only\r\nformidable rival of a certain Perez in the matter of the farming-out of\r\nrevenues and the sale of offices and appointments, which the Philippine\r\ngovernment always confides to private persons. Thus, at the time of\r\nthe events here narrated, Capitan Tiago was a happy man in so far as\r\nit is possible for a narrow-brained individual to be happy in such\r\na land: he was rich, and at peace with God, the government, and men.\r\n\r\nThat he was at peace with God was beyond doubt,--almost like religion\r\nitself. There is no need to be on bad terms with the good God when one\r\nis prosperous on earth, when one has never had any direct dealings with\r\nHim and has never lent Him any money. Capitan Tiago himself had never\r\noffered any prayers to Him, even in his greatest difficulties, for\r\nhe was rich and his gold prayed for him. For masses and supplications\r\nhigh and powerful priests had been created; for novenas and rosaries\r\nGod in His infinite bounty had created the poor for the service of\r\nthe rich--the poor who for a peso could be secured to recite sixteen\r\nmysteries and to read all the sacred books, even the Hebrew Bible, for\r\na little extra. If at any time in the midst of pressing difficulties\r\nhe needed celestial aid and had not at hand even a red Chinese taper,\r\nhe would call upon his most adored saints, promising them many things\r\nfor the purpose of putting them under obligation to him and ultimately\r\nconvincing them of the righteousness of his desires.\r\n\r\nThe saint to whom he promised the most, and whose promises he was\r\nthe most faithful in fulfilling, was the Virgin of Antipolo, Our\r\nLady of Peace and Prosperous Voyages. [32] With many of the lesser\r\nsaints he was not very punctual or even decent; and sometimes,\r\nafter having his petitions granted, he thought no more about them,\r\nthough of course after such treatment he did not bother them again,\r\nwhen occasion arose. Capitan Tiago knew that the calendar was full of\r\nidle saints who perhaps had nothing wherewith to occupy their time up\r\nthere in heaven. Furthermore, to the Virgin of Antipolo he ascribed\r\ngreater power and efficiency than to all the other Virgins combined,\r\nwhether they carried silver canes, naked or richly clothed images of\r\nthe Christ Child, scapularies, rosaries, or girdles. Perhaps this\r\nreverence was owing to the fact that she was a very strict Lady,\r\nwatchful of her name, and, according to the senior sacristan of\r\nAntipolo, an enemy of photography. When she was angered she turned\r\nblack as ebony, while the other Virgins were softer of heart and more\r\nindulgent. It is a well-known fact that some minds love an absolute\r\nmonarch rather than a constitutional one, as witness Louis XIV and\r\nLouis XVI, Philip II and Amadeo I. This fact perhaps explains why\r\ninfidel Chinese and even Spaniards may be seen kneeling in the famous\r\nsanctuary; what is not explained is why the priests run away with\r\nthe money of the terrible Image, go to America, and get married there.\r\n\r\nIn the sala of Capitan Tiago's house, that door, hidden by a silk\r\ncurtain leads to a small chapel or oratory such as must be lacking\r\nin no Filipino home. There were placed his household gods--and we\r\nsay \"gods\" because he was inclined to polytheism rather than to\r\nmonotheism, which he had never come to understand. There could be\r\nseen images of the Holy Family with busts and extremities of ivory,\r\nglass eyes, long eyelashes, and curly blond hair--masterpieces of\r\nSanta Cruz sculpture. Paintings in oil by artists of Paco and Ermita\r\n[33] represented martyrdoms of saints and miracles of the Virgin;\r\nSt. Lucy gazing at the sky and carrying in a plate an extra pair\r\nof eyes with lashes and eyebrows, such as are seen painted in the\r\ntriangle of the Trinity or on Egyptian tombs; St. Pascual Bailon;\r\nSt. Anthony of Padua in a _guingón_ habit looking with tears upon a\r\nChrist Child dressed as a Captain-General with the three-cornered hat,\r\nsword, and boots, as in the children's ball at Madrid that character\r\nis represented--which signified for Capitan Tiago that while God\r\nmight include in His omnipotence the power of a Captain-General of\r\nthe Philippines, the Franciscans would nevertheless play with Him\r\nas with a doll. There, might also be seen a St. Anthony the Abbot\r\nwith a hog by his side, a hog that for the worthy Capitan was as\r\nmiraculous as the saint himself, for which reason he never dared to\r\nrefer to it as the _hog_, but as the _creature of holy St. Anthony_;\r\na St. Francis of Assisi in a coffee-colored robe and with seven\r\nwings, placed over a St. Vincent who had only two but in compensation\r\ncarried a trumpet; a St. Peter the Martyr with his head split open\r\nby the talibon of an evil-doer and held fast by a kneeling infidel,\r\nside by side with another St. Peter cutting off the ear of a Moro,\r\nMalchus [34] no doubt, who was gnawing his lips and writhing with\r\npain, while a fighting-cock on a doric column crowed and flapped his\r\nwings--from all of which Capitan Tiago deduced that in order to be\r\na saint it was just as well to smite as to be smitten.\r\n\r\nWho could enumerate that army of images and recount the virtues and\r\nperfections that were treasured there! A whole chapter would hardly\r\nsuffice. Yet we must not pass over in silence a beautiful St. Michael\r\nof painted and gilded wood almost four feet high. The Archangel\r\nis biting his lower lip and with flashing eyes, frowning forehead,\r\nand rosy cheeks is grasping a Greek shield and brandishing in his\r\nright hand a Sulu kris, ready, as would appear from his attitude and\r\nexpression, to smite a worshiper or any one else who might approach,\r\nrather than the horned and tailed devil that had his teeth set in\r\nhis girlish leg.\r\n\r\nCapitan Tiago never went near this image from fear of a miracle. Had\r\nnot other images, even those more rudely carved ones that issue from\r\nthe carpenter shops of Paete, [35] many times come to life for the\r\nconfusion and punishment of incredulous sinners? It is a well-known\r\nfact that a certain image of Christ in Spain, when invoked as a witness\r\nof promises of love, had assented with a movement of the head in the\r\npresence of the judge, and that another such image had reached out its\r\nright arm to embrace St. Lutgarda. And furthermore, had he not himself\r\nread a booklet recently published about a mimic sermon preached by an\r\nimage of St. Dominic in Soriano? True, the saint had not said a single\r\nword, but from his movements it was inferred, at any rate the author of\r\nthe booklet inferred, that he was announcing the end of the world. [36]\r\nWas it not reported, too, that the Virgin of Luta in the town of Lipa\r\nhad one cheek swollen larger than the other and that there was mud\r\non the borders of her gown? Does not this prove mathematically that\r\nthe holy images also walk about without holding up their skirts and\r\nthat they even suffer from the toothache, perhaps for our sake? Had\r\nhe not seen with his own eyes, during the regular Good-Friday sermon,\r\nall the images of Christ move and bow their heads thrice in unison,\r\nthereby calling forth wails and cries from the women and other\r\nsensitive souls destined for Heaven? More? We ourselves have seen\r\nthe preacher show to the congregation at the moment of the descent\r\nfrom the cross a handkerchief stained with blood, and were ourselves\r\non the point of weeping piously, when, to the sorrow of our soul, a\r\nsacristan assured us that it was all a joke, that the blood was that\r\nof a chicken which had been roasted and eaten on the spot in spite\r\nof the fact that it was Good Friday--and the sacristan was fat! So\r\nCapitan Tiago, even though he was a prudent and pious individual,\r\ntook care not to approach the kris of St. Michael. \"Let's take no\r\nchances,\" he would say to himself, \"I know that he's an archangel,\r\nbut I don't trust him, no, I don't trust him.\"\r\n\r\nNot a year passed without his joining with an orchestra in the\r\npilgrimage to the wealthy shrine of Antipolo. He paid for two\r\nthanksgiving masses of the many that make up the three novenas,\r\nand also for the days when there are no novenas, and washed himself\r\nafterwards in the famous _bátis_, or pool, where the sacred Image\r\nherself had bathed. Her votaries can even yet discern the tracks of\r\nher feet and the traces of her locks in the hard rock, where she dried\r\nthem, resembling exactly those made by any woman who uses coconut-oil,\r\nand just as if her hair had been steel or diamonds and she had weighed\r\na thousand tons. We should like to see the terrible Image once shake\r\nher sacred hair in the eyes of those credulous persons and put her\r\nfoot upon their tongues or their heads. There at the very edge of the\r\npool Capitan Tiago made it his duty to eat roast pig, _sinigang_ of\r\n_dalag_ with _alibambang_ leaves, and other more or less appetizing\r\ndishes. The two masses would cost him over four hundred pesos, but\r\nit was cheap, after all, if one considered the glory that the Mother\r\nof the Lord would acquire from the pin-wheels, rockets, bombs, and\r\nmortars, and also the increased profits which, thanks to these masses,\r\nwould come to one during the year.\r\n\r\nBut Antipolo was not the only theater of his ostentatious devotion. In\r\nBinondo, in Pampanga, and in the town of San Diego, when he was about\r\nto put up a fighting-cock with large wagers, he would send gold moneys\r\nto the curate for propitiatory masses and, just as the Romans consulted\r\nthe augurs before a battle, giving food to the sacred fowls, so Capitan\r\nTiago would also consult his augurs, with the modifications befitting\r\nthe times and the new truths, tie would watch closely the flame of\r\nthe tapers, the smoke from the incense, the voice of the priest,\r\nand from it all attempt to forecast his luck. It was an admitted\r\nfact that he lost very few wagers, and in those cases it was due to\r\nthe unlucky circumstance that the officiating priest was hoarse,\r\nor that the altar-candles were few or contained too much tallow,\r\nor that a bad piece of money had slipped in with the rest. The\r\nwarden of the Brotherhood would then assure him that such reverses\r\nwere tests to which he was subjected by Heaven to receive assurance\r\nof his fidelity and devotion. So, beloved by the priests, respected\r\nby the sacristans, humored by the Chinese chandlers and the dealers\r\nin fireworks, he was a man happy in the religion of this world, and\r\npersons of discernment and great piety even claimed for him great\r\ninfluence in the celestial court.\r\n\r\nThat he was at peace with the government cannot be doubted, however\r\ndifficult an achievement it may seem. Incapable of any new idea and\r\nsatisfied with his _modus vivendi_, he was ever ready to gratify\r\nthe desires of the last official of the fifth class in every one of\r\nthe offices, to make presents of hams, capons, turkeys, and Chinese\r\nfruits at all seasons of the year. If he heard any one speak ill of\r\nthe natives, he, who did not consider himself as such, would join in\r\nthe chorus and speak worse of them; if any one aspersed the Chinese or\r\nSpanish mestizos, he would do the same, perhaps because he considered\r\nhimself become a full-blooded Iberian. He was ever first to talk in\r\nfavor of any new imposition of taxes, or special assessment, especially\r\nwhen he smelled a contract or a farming assignment behind it. He always\r\nhad an orchestra ready for congratulating and serenading the governors,\r\njudges, and other officials on their name-days and birthdays, at the\r\nbirth or death of a relative, and in fact at every variation from the\r\nusual monotony. For such occasions he would secure laudatory poems\r\nand hymns in which were celebrated \"the kind and loving governor,\"\r\n\"the brave and courageous judge for whom there awaits in heaven the\r\npalm of the just,\" with many other things of the same kind.\r\n\r\nHe was the president of the rich guild of mestizos in spite of\r\nthe protests of many of them, who did not regard him as one of\r\nthemselves. In the two years that he held this office he wore out ten\r\nfrock coats, an equal number of high hats, and half a dozen canes. The\r\nfrock coat and the high hat were in evidence at the Ayuntamiento,\r\nin the governor-general's palace, and at military headquarters; the\r\nhigh hat and the frock coat might have been noticed in the cockpit,\r\nin the market, in the processions, in the Chinese shops, and under the\r\nhat and within the coat might have been seen the perspiring Capitan\r\nTiago, waving his tasseled cane, directing, arranging, and throwing\r\neverything into disorder with marvelous activity and a gravity even\r\nmore marvelous.\r\n\r\nSo the authorities saw in him a safe man, gifted with the best of\r\ndispositions, peaceful, tractable, and obsequious, who read no books\r\nor newspapers from Spain, although he spoke Spanish well. Indeed,\r\nthey rather looked upon him with the feeling with which a poor student\r\ncontemplates the worn-out heel of his old shoe, twisted by his manner\r\nof walking. In his case there was truth in both the Christian and\r\nprofane proverbs _beati pauperes spiritu_ and _beati possidentes_,\r\n[37] and there might well be applied to him that translation,\r\naccording to some people incorrect, from the Greek, \"Glory to God\r\nin the highest and peace to men of good-will on earth!\" even though\r\nwe shall see further along that it is not sufficient for men to have\r\ngood-will in order to live in peace.\r\n\r\nThe irreverent considered him a fool, the poor regarded him\r\nas a heartless and cruel exploiter of misery and want, and his\r\ninferiors saw in him a despot and a tyrant. As to the women, ah,\r\nthe women! Accusing rumors buzzed through the wretched nipa huts,\r\nand it was said that wails and sobs might be heard mingled with the\r\nweak cries of an infant. More than one young woman was pointed out by\r\nher neighbors with the finger of scorn: she had a downcast glance and\r\na faded cheek. But such things never robbed him of sleep nor did any\r\nmaiden disturb his peace. It was an old woman who made him suffer,\r\nan old woman who was his rival in piety and who had gained from many\r\ncurates such enthusiastic praises and eulogies as he in his best days\r\nhad never received.\r\n\r\nBetween Capitan Tiago and this widow, who had inherited from brothers\r\nand cousins, there existed a holy rivalry which redounded to the\r\nbenefit of the Church as the competition among the Pampanga steamers\r\nthen redounded to the benefit of the public. Did Capitan Tiago present\r\nto some Virgin a silver wand ornamented with emeralds and topazes? At\r\nonce Doña Patrocinio had ordered another of gold set with diamonds! If\r\nat the time of the Naval procession [38] Capitan Tiago erected an\r\narch with two façades, covered with ruffled cloth and decorated with\r\nmirrors, glass globes, and chandeliers, then Doña Patrocinio would\r\nhave another with four facades, six feet higher, and more gorgeous\r\nhangings. Then he would fall back on his reserves, his strong point,\r\nhis specialty--masses with bombs and fireworks; whereat Doña Patrocinia\r\ncould only gnaw at her lips with her toothless gums, because, being\r\nexceedingly nervous, she could not endure the chiming of the bells and\r\nstill less the explosions of the bombs. While he smiled in triumph,\r\nshe would plan her revenge and pay the money of others to secure the\r\nbest orators of the five Orders in Manila, the most famous preachers\r\nof the Cathedral, and even the Paulists, [39] to preach on the holy\r\ndays upon profound theological subjects to the sinners who understood\r\nonly the vernacular of the mariners. The partizans of Capitan Tiago\r\nwould observe that she slept during the sermon; but her adherents\r\nwould answer that the sermon was paid for in advance, and by her,\r\nand that in any affair payment was the prime requisite. At length,\r\nshe had driven him from the field completely by presenting to the\r\nchurch three _andas_ of gilded silver, each one of which cost her\r\nover three thousand pesos. Capitan Tiago hoped that the old woman\r\nwould breathe her last almost any day, or that she would lose five or\r\nsix of her lawsuits, so that he might be alone in serving God; but\r\nunfortunately the best lawyers of the _Real Audiencia_ looked after\r\nher interests, and as to her health, there was no part of her that\r\ncould be attacked by sickness; she seemed to be a steel wire, no doubt\r\nfor the edification of souls, and she hung on in this vale of tears\r\nwith the tenacity of a boil on the skin. Her adherents were secure in\r\nthe belief that she would be canonized at her death and that Capitan\r\nTiago himself would have to worship her at the altars--all of which\r\nhe agreed to and cheerfully promised, provided only that she die soon.\r\n\r\nSuch was Capitan Tiago in the days of which we write. As for the past,\r\nhe was the only son of a sugar-planter of Malabon, wealthy enough,\r\nbut so miserly that he would not spend a cent to educate his son,\r\nfor which reason the little Santiago had been the servant of a good\r\nDominican, a worthy man who had tried to train him in all of good\r\nthat he knew and could teach. When he had reached the happy stage\r\nof being known among his acquaintances as a _logician_, that is,\r\nwhen he began to study logic, the death of his protector, soon\r\nfollowed by that of his father, put an end to his studies and he\r\nhad to turn his attention to business affairs. He married a pretty\r\nyoung woman of Santa Cruz, who gave him social position and helped\r\nhim to make his fortune. Doña Pia Alba was not satisfied with buying\r\nand selling sugar, indigo, and coffee, but wished to plant and reap,\r\nso the newly-married couple bought land in San Diego. From this time\r\ndated their friendship with Padre Damoso and with Don Rafael Ibarra,\r\nthe richest capitalist of the town.\r\n\r\nThe lack of an heir in the first six years of their wedded life\r\nmade of that eagerness to accumulate riches almost a censurable\r\nambition. Doña Pia was comely, strong, and healthy, yet it was in\r\nvain that she offered novenas and at the advice of the devout women\r\nof San Diego made a pilgrimage to the Virgin of Kaysaysay [40] in\r\nTaal, distributed alms to the poor, and danced at midday in May in\r\nthe procession of the Virgin of Turumba [41] in Pakil. But it was all\r\nwith no result until Fray Damaso advised her to go to Obando to dance\r\nin the fiesta of St. Pascual Bailon and ask him for a son. Now it\r\nis well known that there is in Obando a trinity which grants sons or\r\ndaughters according to request--Our Lady of Salambaw, St. Clara, and\r\nSt. Pascual. Thanks to this wise advice, Doña Pia soon recognized the\r\nsigns of approaching motherhood. But alas! like the fisherman of whom\r\nShakespeare tells in _Macbeth_, who ceased to sing when he had found a\r\ntreasure, she at once lost all her mirthfulness, fell into melancholy,\r\nand was never seen to smile again. \"Capriciousness, natural in her\r\ncondition,\" commented all, even Capitan Tiago. A puerperal fever put\r\nan end to her hidden grief, and she died, leaving behind a beautiful\r\ngirl baby for whom Fray Damaso himself stood sponsor. As St. Pascual\r\nhad not granted the son that was asked, they gave the child the name\r\nof Maria Clara, in honor of the Virgin of Salambaw and St. Clara,\r\npunishing the worthy St. Pascual with silence.\r\n\r\nThe little girl grew up under the care of her aunt Isabel, that good\r\nold lady of monkish urbanity whom we met at the beginning of the\r\nstory. For the most part, her early life was spent in San Diego, on\r\naccount of its healthful climate, and there Padre Damaso was devoted\r\nto her.\r\n\r\nMaria Clara had not the small eyes of her father; like her mother,\r\nshe had eyes large, black, long-lashed, merry and smiling when she\r\nwas playing but sad, deep, and pensive in moments of repose. As a\r\nchild her hair was curly and almost blond, her straight nose was\r\nneither too pointed nor too flat, while her mouth with the merry\r\ndimples at the corners recalled the small and pleasing one of her\r\nmother, her skin had the fineness of an onion-cover and was white as\r\ncotton, according to her perplexed relatives, who found the traces\r\nof Capitan Tiago's paternity in her small and shapely ears. Aunt\r\nIsabel ascribed her half-European features to the longings of Doña\r\nPia, whom she remembered to have seen many times weeping before\r\nthe image of St. Anthony. Another cousin was of the same opinion,\r\ndiffering only in the choice of the smut, as for her it was either\r\nthe Virgin herself or St. Michael. A famous philosopher, who was\r\nthe cousin of Capitan Tinong and who had memorized the \"Amat,\" [42]\r\nsought for the true explanation in planetary influences.\r\n\r\nThe idol of all, Maria Clara grew up amidst smiles and love. The\r\nvery friars showered her with attentions when she appeared in the\r\nprocessions dressed in white, her abundant hair interwoven with\r\ntuberoses and sampaguitas, with two diminutive wings of silver and\r\ngold fastened on the back of her gown, and carrying in her hands a\r\npair of white doves tied with blue ribbons. Afterwards, she would\r\nbe so merry and talk so sweetly in her childish simplicity that the\r\nenraptured Capitan Tiago could do nothing but bless the saints of\r\nObando and advise every one to purchase beautiful works of sculpture.\r\n\r\nIn southern countries the girl of thirteen or fourteen years\r\nchanges into a woman as the bud of the night becomes a flower in the\r\nmorning. At this period of change, so full of mystery and romance,\r\nMaria Clara was placed, by the advice of the curate of Binondo, in\r\nthe nunnery of St. Catherine [43] in order to receive strict religious\r\ntraining from the Sisters. With tears she took leave of Padre Damaso\r\nand of the only lad who had been a friend of her childhood, Crisostomo\r\nIbarra, who himself shortly afterward went away to Europe. There in\r\nthat convent, which communicates with the world through double bars,\r\neven under the watchful eyes of the nuns, she spent seven years.\r\n\r\nEach having his own particular ends in view and knowing the mutual\r\ninclinations of the two young persons, Don Rafael and Capitan Tiago\r\nagreed upon the marriage of their children and the formation of a\r\nbusiness partnership. This agreement, which was concluded some years\r\nafter the younger Ibarra's departure, was celebrated with equal joy\r\nby two hearts in widely separated parts of the world and under very\r\ndifferent circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nAn Idyl on an Azotea\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Song of Songs, which is Solomon's.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat morning Aunt Isabel and Maria Clara went early to mass,\r\nthe latter elegantly dressed and wearing a rosary of blue beads,\r\nwhich partly served as a bracelet for her, and the former with her\r\nspectacles in order to read her _Anchor of Salvation_ during the holy\r\ncommunion. Scarcely had the priest disappeared from the altar when the\r\nmaiden expressed a desire for returning home, to the great surprise and\r\ndispleasure of her good aunt, who believed her niece to be as pious\r\nand devoted to praying as a nun, at least. Grumbling and crossing\r\nherself, the good old lady rose. \"The good Lord will forgive me, Aunt\r\nIsabel, since He must know the hearts of girls better than you do,\"\r\nMaria Clara might have said to check the severe yet maternal chidings.\r\n\r\nAfter they had breakfasted, Maria Clara consumed her impatience in\r\nworking at a silk purse while her aunt was trying to clean up the\r\ntraces of the former night's revelry by swinging a feather duster\r\nabout. Capitan Tiago was busy looking over some papers. Every noise in\r\nthe street, every carriage that passed, caused the maiden to tremble\r\nand quickened the beatings of her heart. Now she wished that she were\r\nback in the quiet convent among her friends; there she could have seen\r\nhim without emotion and agitation! But was he not the companion of her\r\ninfancy, had they not played together and even quarreled at times? The\r\nreason for all this I need not explain; if you, O reader, have ever\r\nloved, you will understand; and if you have not, it is useless for\r\nme to tell you, as the uninitiated do not comprehend these mysteries.\r\n\r\n\"I believe, Maria, that the doctor is right,\" said Capitan Tiago. \"You\r\nought to go into the country, for you are pale and need fresh air. What\r\ndo you think of Malabon or San Diego?\" At the mention of the latter\r\nplace Maria Clara blushed like a poppy and was unable to answer.\r\n\r\n\"You and Isabel can go at once to the convent to get your clothes\r\nand to say good-by to your friends,\" he continued, without raising\r\nhis head. \"You will not stay there any longer.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl felt the vague sadness that possesses the mind when we leave\r\nforever a place where we have been happy, but another thought softened\r\nthis sorrow.\r\n\r\n\"In four or five days, after you get some new clothes made, we'll\r\ngo to Malabon. Your godfather is no longer in San Diego. The priest\r\nthat you may have noticed here last night, that young padre, is the\r\nnew curate whom we have there, and he is a saint.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think that San Diego would be better, cousin,\" observed Aunt\r\nIsabel. \"Besides, our house there is better and the time for the\r\nfiesta draws near.\"\r\n\r\nMaria Clara wanted to embrace her aunt for this speech, but hearing\r\na carriage stop, she turned pale.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, very true,\" answered Capitan Tiago, and then in a different tone\r\nhe exclaimed, \"Don Crisostomo!\"\r\n\r\nThe maiden let her sewing fall from her hands and wished to move but\r\ncould not--a violent tremor ran through her body. Steps were heard\r\non the stairway and then a fresh, manly voice. As if that voice had\r\nsome magic power, the maiden controlled her emotion and ran to hide\r\nin the oratory among the saints. The two cousins laughed, and Ibarra\r\neven heard the noise of the door closing. Pale and breathing rapidly,\r\nthe maiden pressed her beating heart and tried to listen. She heard\r\nhis voice, that beloved voice that for so long a time she had heard\r\nonly in her dreams he was asking for her! Overcome with joy, she\r\nkissed the nearest saint, which happened to be St. Anthony the Abbot,\r\na saint happy in flesh and in wood, ever the object of pleasing\r\ntemptations! Afterwards she sought the keyhole in order to see and\r\nexamine him. She smiled, and when her aunt snatched her from that\r\nposition she unconsciously threw her arms around the old lady's neck\r\nand rained kisses upon her.\r\n\r\n\"Foolish child, what's the matter with you?\" the old lady was at last\r\nable to say as she wiped a tear from her faded eyes. Maria Clara felt\r\nashamed and covered her eyes with her plump arm.\r\n\r\n\"Come on, get ready, come!\" added the old aunt fondly. \"While he is\r\ntalking to your father about you. Come, don't make him wait.\" Like\r\na child the maiden obediently followed her and they shut themselves\r\nup in her chamber.\r\n\r\nCapitan Tiago and Ibarra were conversing in a lively manner when Aunt\r\nIsabel appeared half dragging her niece, who was looking in every\r\ndirection except toward the persons in the room.\r\n\r\nWhat said those two souls communicating through the language of the\r\neyes, more perfect than that of the lips, the language given to the\r\nsoul in order that sound may not mar the ecstasy of feeling? In such\r\nmoments, when the thoughts of two happy beings penetrate into each\r\nother's souls through the eyes, the spoken word is halting, rude, and\r\nweak--it is as the harsh, slow roar of the thunder compared with the\r\nrapidity of the dazzling lightning flash, expressing feelings already\r\nrecognized, ideas already understood, and if words are made use of\r\nit is only because the heart's desire, dominating all the being and\r\nflooding it with happiness, wills that the whole human organism with\r\nall its physical and psychical powers give expression to the song of\r\njoy that rolls through the soul. To the questioning glance of love,\r\nas it flashes out and then conceals itself, speech has no reply;\r\nthe smile, the kiss, the sigh answer.\r\n\r\nSoon the two lovers, fleeing from the dust raised by Aunt Isabel's\r\nbroom, found themselves on the azotea where they could commune in\r\nliberty among the little arbors. What did they tell each other in\r\nmurmurs that you nod your heads, O little red cypress flowers? Tell\r\nit, you who have fragrance in your breath and color on your lips. And\r\nthou, O zephyr, who learnest rare harmonies in the stillness of the\r\ndark night amid the hidden depths of our virgin forests! Tell it,\r\nO sunbeams, brilliant manifestation upon earth of the Eternal, sole\r\nimmaterial essence in a material world, you tell it, for I only know\r\nhow to relate prosaic commonplaces. But since you seem unwilling to\r\ndo so, I am going to try myself.\r\n\r\nThe sky was blue and a fresh breeze, not yet laden with the fragrance\r\nof roses, stirred the leaves and flowers of the vines; that is why\r\nthe cypresses, the orchids, the dried fishes, and the Chinese lanterns\r\nwere trembling. The splash of paddles in the muddy waters of the river\r\nand the rattle of carriages and carts passing over the Binondo bridge\r\ncame up to them distinctly, although they did not hear what the old\r\naunt murmured as she saw where they were: \"That's better, there you'll\r\nbe watched by the whole neighborhood.\" At first they talked nonsense,\r\ngiving utterance only to those sweet inanities which are so much like\r\nthe boastings of the nations of Europe--pleasing and honey-sweet at\r\nhome, but causing foreigners to laugh or frown.\r\n\r\nShe, like a sister of Cain, was of course jealous and asked her\r\nsweetheart, \"Have you always thought of me? Have you never forgotten me\r\non all your travels in the great cities among so many beautiful women?\"\r\n\r\nHe, too, was a brother of Cain, and sought to evade such questions,\r\nmaking use of a little fiction. \"Could I forget you?\" he answered\r\nas he gazed enraptured into her dark eyes. \"Could I be faithless\r\nto my oath, my sacred oath? Do you remember that stormy night when\r\nyou saw me weeping alone by the side of my dead mother and, drawing\r\nnear to me, you put your hand on my shoulder, that hand which for so\r\nlong a time you had not allowed me to touch, saying to me, 'You have\r\nlost your mother while I never had one,' and you wept with me? You\r\nloved her and she looked upon you as a daughter. Outside it rained\r\nand the lightning flashed, but within I seemed to hear music and to\r\nsee a smile on the pallid face of the dead. Oh, that my parents were\r\nalive and might behold you now! I then caught your hand along with\r\nthe hand of my mother and swore to love you and to make you happy,\r\nwhatever fortune Heaven might have in store for me; and that oath,\r\nwhich has never weighed upon me as a burden, I now renew!\r\n\r\n\"Could I forget you? The thought of you has ever been with me,\r\nstrengthening me amid the dangers of travel, and has been a comfort\r\nto my soul's loneliness in foreign lands. The thoughts of you\r\nhave neutralized the lotus-effect of Europe, which erases from the\r\nmemories of so many of our countrymen the hopes and misfortunes of our\r\nfatherland. In dreams I saw you standing on the shore at Manila, gazing\r\nat the far horizon wrapped in the warm light of the early dawn. I heard\r\nthe slow, sad song that awoke in me sleeping affections and called\r\nback to the memory of my heart the first years of our childhood, our\r\njoys, our pleasures, and all that happy past which you gave life to\r\nwhile you were in our town. It seemed to me that you were the fairy,\r\nthe spirit, the poetic incarnation of my fatherland, beautiful,\r\nunaffected, lovable, frank, a true daughter of the Philippines,\r\nthat beautiful land which unites with the imposing virtues of the\r\nmother country, Spain, the admirable qualities of a young people,\r\nas you unite in your being all that is beautiful and lovely, the\r\ninheritance of both races\" so indeed the love of you and that of my\r\nfatherland have become fused into one.\r\n\r\n\"Could I forget you? Many times have I thought that I heard the\r\nsound of your piano and the accents of your voice. When in Germany,\r\nas I wandered at twilight in the woods, peopled with the fantastic\r\ncreations of its poets and the mysterious legends of past generations,\r\nalways I called upon your name, imagining that I saw you in the mists\r\nthat rose from the depths of the valley, or I fancied that I heard\r\nyour voice in the rustling of the leaves. When from afar I heard the\r\nsongs of the peasants as they returned from their labors, it seemed to\r\nme that their tones harmonized with my inner voices, that they were\r\nsinging for _you_, and thus they lent reality to my illusions and\r\ndreams. At times I became lost among the mountain paths and while the\r\nnight descended slowly, as it does there, I would find myself still\r\nwandering, seeking my way among the pines and beeches and oaks. Then\r\nwhen some scattering rays of moonlight slipped down into the clear\r\nspaces left in the dense foliage, I seemed to see you in the heart of\r\nthe forest as a dim, loving shade wavering about between the spots of\r\nlight and shadow. If perhaps the nightingale poured forth his varied\r\ntrills, I fancied it was because he saw you and was inspired by you.\r\n\r\n\"Have I thought of you? The fever of love not only gave warmth to the\r\nsnows but colored the ice! The beautiful skies of Italy with their\r\nclear depths reminded me of your eyes, its sunny landscape spoke to\r\nme of your smile; the plains of Andalusia with their scent-laden\r\nairs, peopled with oriental memories, full of romance and color,\r\ntold me of your love! On dreamy, moonlit nights, while boating oil\r\nthe Rhine, I have asked myself if my fancy did not deceive me as I\r\nsaw you among the poplars on the banks, on the rocks of the Lorelei,\r\nor in the midst of the waters, singing in the silence of the night\r\nas if you were a comforting fairy maiden sent to enliven the solitude\r\nand sadness of those ruined castles!\"\r\n\r\n\"I have not traveled like you, so I know only your town and Manila and\r\nAntipolo,\" she answered with a smile which showed that she believed\r\nall he said. \"But since I said good-by to you and entered the convent,\r\nI have always thought of you and have only put you out of my mind\r\nwhen ordered to do so by my confessor, who imposed many penances upon\r\nme. I recalled our games and our quarrels when we were children. You\r\nused to pick up the most beautiful shells and search in the river\r\nfor the roundest and smoothest pebbles of different colors that we\r\nmight play games with them. You were very stupid and always lost,\r\nand by way of a forfeit I would slap you with the palm of my hand,\r\nbut I always tried not to strike you hard, for I had pity on you. In\r\nthose games you cheated much, even more than I did, and we used to\r\nfinish our play in a quarrel. Do you remember that time when you\r\nbecame really angry at me? Then you made me suffer, but afterwards,\r\nwhen I thought of it in the convent, I smiled and longed for you so\r\nthat we might quarrel again--so that we might once more make up. We\r\nwere still children and had gone with your mother to bathe in the brook\r\nunder the shade of the thick bamboo. On the banks grew many flowers\r\nand plants whose strange names you told me in Latin and Spanish, for\r\nyou were even then studying in the Ateneo. [44] I paid no attention,\r\nbut amused myself by running after the needle-like dragon-flies and\r\nthe butterflies with their rainbow colors and tints of mother-of-pearl\r\nas they swarmed about among the flowers. Sometimes I tried to surprise\r\nthem with my hands or to catch the little fishes that slipped rapidly\r\nabout amongst the moss and stones in the edge of the water. Once you\r\ndisappeared suddenly and when you returned you brought a crown of\r\nleaves and orange blossoms, which you placed upon my head, calling me\r\nChloe. For yourself you made one of vines. But your mother snatched\r\naway my crown, and after mashing it with a stone mixed it with the\r\n_gogo_ with which she was going to wash our heads. The tears came into\r\nyour eyes and you said that she did not understand mythology. 'Silly\r\nboy,' your mother exclaimed, 'you'll see how sweet your hair will\r\nsmell afterwards.' I laughed, but you were offended and would not talk\r\nwith me, and for the rest of the day appeared so serious that then\r\nI wanted to cry. On our way back to the town through the hot sun,\r\nI picked some sage leaves that grew beside the path and gave them\r\nto you to put in your hat so that you might not get a headache. You\r\nsmiled and caught my hand, and we made up.\"\r\n\r\nIbarra smiled with happiness as he opened his pocketbook and took from\r\nit a piece of paper in which were wrapped some dry, blackened leaves\r\nwhich gave off a sweet odor. \"Your sage leaves,\" he said, in answer\r\nto her inquiring look. \"This is all that you have ever given me.\"\r\n\r\nShe in turn snatched from her bosom a little pouch of white\r\nsatin. \"You must not touch this,\" she said, tapping the palm of his\r\nhand lightly. \"It's a letter of farewell.\"\r\n\r\n\"The one I wrote to you before leaving?\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you ever written me any other, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"And what did I say to you then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Many fibs, excuses of a delinquent debtor,\" she answered smilingly,\r\nthus giving him to understand how sweet to her those fibs were. \"Be\r\nquiet now and I'll read it to you. I'll leave out your fine phrases\r\nin order not to make a martyr of you.\"\r\n\r\nRaising the paper to the height of her eyes so that the youth might\r\nnot see her face, she began: \"'_My_'--but I'll not read what follows\r\nthat because it's not true.\"\r\n\r\nHer eyes ran along some lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"'My father wishes me to go away, in spite of all my pleadings. 'You\r\nare a man now,' he told me, 'and you must think about your future\r\nand about your duties. You must learn the science of life, a thing\r\nwhich your fatherland cannot teach you, so that you may some day be\r\nuseful to it. If you remain here in my shadow, in this environment\r\nof business affairs, you will not learn to look far ahead. The\r\nday in which you lose me you will find yourself like the plant\r\nof which our poet Baltazar tells: grown in the water, its leaves\r\nwither at the least scarcity of moisture and a moment's heat dries\r\nit up. Don't you understand? You are almost a young man, and yet you\r\nweep!' These reproaches hurt me and I confessed that I loved you. My\r\nfather reflected for a time in silence and then, placing his hand on\r\nmy shoulder, said in a trembling voice, 'Do you think that you alone\r\nknow how to love, that your father does not love you, and that he will\r\nnot feel the separation from you? It is only a short time since we\r\nlost your mother, and I must journey on alone toward old age, toward\r\nthe very time of life when I would seek help and comfort from your\r\nyouth, yet I accept my loneliness, hardly knowing whether I shall\r\never see you again. But you must think of other and greater things;\r\nthe future lies open before you, while for me it is already passing\r\nbehind; your love is just awakening, while mine is dying; fire burns\r\nin your blood, while the chill is creeping into mine. Yet you weep\r\nand cannot sacrifice the present for the future, useful as it may be\r\nalike to yourself and to your country.' My father's eyes filled with\r\ntears and I fell upon my knees at his feet, I embraced him, I begged\r\nhis forgiveness, and I assured him that I was ready to set out--'\"\r\n\r\nIbarra's growing agitation caused her to suspend the reading, for he\r\nhad grown pale and was pacing back and forth.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter? What is troubling you?\" she asked him.\r\n\r\n\"You have almost made me forget that I have my duties, that I must\r\nleave at once for the town. Tomorrow is the day for commemorating\r\nthe dead.\"\r\n\r\nMaria Clara silently fixed her large dreamy eyes upon him for a few\r\nmoments and then, picking some flowers, she said with emotion, \"Go,\r\nI won't detain you longer! In a few days we shall see each other\r\nagain. Lay these flowers on the tomb of your parents.\"\r\n\r\nA few moments later the youth descended the stairway accompanied by\r\nCapitan Tiago and Aunt Isabel, while Maria Clara shut herself up in\r\nthe oratory.\r\n\r\n\"Please tell Andeng to get the house ready, as Maria and Isabel are\r\ncoming. A pleasant journey!\" said Capitan Tiago as Ibarra stepped into\r\nthe carriage, which at once started in the direction of the plaza of\r\nSan Gabriel.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, by way of consolation, her father said to Maria Clara, who\r\nwas weeping beside an image of the Virgin, \"Come, light two candles\r\nworth two reals each, one to St. Roch, [45] and one to St. Raphael,\r\nthe protector of travelers. Light the lamp of Our Lady of Peace and\r\nProsperous Voyages, since there are so many tulisanes. It's better\r\nto spend four reals for wax and six cuartos for oil now than to pay\r\na big ransom later.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nRecollections\r\n\r\n\r\nIbarra's carriage was passing through a part of the busiest district\r\nin Manila, the same which the night before had made him feel sad,\r\nbut which by daylight caused him to smile in spite of himself. The\r\nmovement in every part, so many carriages coming and going at full\r\nspeed, the carromatas and calesas, the Europeans, the Chinese,\r\nthe natives, each in his own peculiar costume, the fruit-venders,\r\nthe money-changers, the naked porters, the grocery stores, the lunch\r\nstands and restaurants, the shops, and even the carts drawn by the\r\nimpassive and indifferent carabao, who seems to amuse himself in\r\ncarrying burdens while he patiently ruminates, all this noise and\r\nconfusion, the very sun itself, the distinctive odors and the motley\r\ncolors, awoke in the youth's mind a world of sleeping recollections.\r\n\r\nThose streets had not yet been paved, and two successive days of\r\nsunshine filled them with dust which covered everything and made the\r\npasser-by cough while it nearly blinded him. A day of rain formed\r\npools of muddy water, which at night reflected the carriage lights and\r\nsplashed mud a distance of several yards away upon the pedestrians on\r\nthe narrow sidewalks. And how many women have left their embroidered\r\nslippers in those waves of mud!\r\n\r\nThen there might have been seen repairing those streets the lines of\r\nconvicts with their shaven heads, dressed in short-sleeved camisas\r\nand pantaloons that reached only to their knees, each with his letter\r\nand number in blue. On their legs were chains partly wrapped in dirty\r\nrags to ease the chafing or perhaps the chill of the iron. Joined\r\ntwo by two, scorched in the sun, worn out by the heat and fatigue,\r\nthey were lashed and goaded by a whip in the hands of one of their own\r\nnumber, who perhaps consoled himself with this power of maltreating\r\nothers. They were tall men with somber faces, which he had never seen\r\nbrightened with the light of a smile. Yet their eyes gleamed when the\r\nwhistling lash fell upon their shoulders or when a passer-by threw\r\nthem the chewed and broken stub of a cigar, which the nearest would\r\nsnatch up and hide in his salakot, while the rest remained gazing at\r\nthe passers-by with strange looks.\r\n\r\nThe noise of the stones being crushed to fill the puddles and the\r\nmerry clank of the heavy fetters on the swollen ankles seemed to remain\r\nwith Ibarra. He shuddered as he recalled a scene that had made a deep\r\nimpression on his childish imagination. It was a hot afternoon, and the\r\nburning rays of the sun fell perpendicularly upon a large cart by the\r\nside of which was stretched out one of those unfortunates, lifeless,\r\nyet with his eyes half opened. Two others were silently preparing\r\na bamboo bier, showing no signs of anger or sorrow or impatience,\r\nfor such is the character attributed to the natives: today it is you,\r\ntomorrow it will be I, they say to themselves. The people moved rapidly\r\nabout without giving heed, women came up and after a look of curiosity\r\ncontinued unconcerned on their way--it was such a common sight that\r\ntheir hearts had become callous. Carriages passed, flashing back from\r\ntheir varnished sides the rays of the sun that burned in a cloudless\r\nsky. Only he, a child of eleven years and fresh from the country, was\r\nmoved, and to him alone it brought bad dreams on the following night.\r\n\r\nThere no longer existed the useful and honored _Puente de Barcas_, the\r\ngood Filipino pontoon bridge that had done its best to be of service\r\nin spite of its natural imperfections and its rising and falling\r\nat the caprice of the Pasig, which had more than once abused it and\r\nfinally destroyed it. The almond trees in the plaza of San Gabriel\r\n[46] had not grown; they were still in the same feeble and stunted\r\ncondition. The Escolta appeared less beautiful in spite of the fact\r\nthat an imposing building with caryatids carved on its front now\r\noccupied the place of the old row of shops. The new Bridge of Spain\r\ncaught his attention, while the houses on the right bank of the river\r\namong the clumps of bamboo and trees where the Escolta ends and the\r\nIsla de Romero begins, reminded him of the cool mornings when he used\r\nto pass there in a boat on his way to the baths of Uli-Uli.\r\n\r\nHe met many carriages, drawn by beautiful pairs of dwarfish ponies,\r\nwithin which were government clerks who seemed yet half asleep as they\r\nmade their way to their offices, or military officers, or Chinese in\r\nfoolish and ridiculous attitudes, or Gave friars and canons. In an\r\nelegant victoria he thought he recognized Padre Damaso, grave and\r\nfrowning, but he had already passed. Now he was pleasantly greeted\r\nby Capitan Tinong, who was passing in a carretela with his wife and\r\ntwo daughters.\r\n\r\nAs they went down off the bridge the horses broke into a trot along the\r\nSabana Drive. [47] On the left the Arroceros Cigar Factory resounded\r\nwith the noise of the cigar-makers pounding the tobacco leaves, and\r\nIbarra was unable to restrain a smile as he thought of the strong odor\r\nwhich about five o'clock in the afternoon used to float all over the\r\n_Puente de Barcas_ and which had made him sick when he was a child. The\r\nlively conversations and the repartee of the crowds from the cigar\r\nfactories carried him back to the district of Lavapiés in Madrid,\r\nwith its riots of cigar-makers, so fatal for the unfortunate policemen.\r\n\r\nThe Botanical Garden drove away these agreeable recollections; the\r\ndemon of comparison brought before his mind the Botanical Gardens\r\nof Europe, in countries where great, labor and much money are needed\r\nto make a single leaf grow or one flower open its calyx; he recalled\r\nthose of the colonies, where they are well supplied and tended, and\r\nall open to the public. Ibarra turned away his gaze toward the old\r\nManila surrounded still by its walls and moats like a sickly girl\r\nwrapped in the garments of her grandmother's better days.\r\n\r\nThen the sight of the sea losing itself in the distance! \"On\r\nthe other shore lies Europe,\" thought the young man,--\"Europe,\r\nwith its attractive peoples in constant movement in the search for\r\nhappiness, weaving their dreams in the morning and disillusioning\r\nthemselves at the setting of the sun, happy even in the midst of\r\ntheir calamities. Yes, on the farther shore of the boundless sea\r\nare the really spiritual nations, those who, even though they put\r\nno restraints on material development, are still more spiritual than\r\nthose who pride themselves on adoring only the spirit!\"\r\n\r\nBut these musings were in turn banished from his mind as he came in\r\nsight of the little mound in Bagumbayan Field. [48] This isolated\r\nknoll at the side of the Luneta now caught his attention and made him\r\nreminiscent. He thought of the man who had awakened his intellect and\r\nmade him understand goodness and justice. The ideas which that man\r\nhad impressed upon him were not many, to be sure, but they were not\r\nmeaningless repetitions, they were convictions which had not paled\r\nin the light of the most brilliant foci of progress. That man was an\r\nold priest whose words of farewell still resounded in his ears: \"Do\r\nnot forget that if knowledge is the heritage of mankind, it is only\r\nthe courageous who inherit it,\" he had reminded him. \"I have tried to\r\npass on to you what I got from my teachers, the sum of which I have\r\nendeavored to increase and transmit to the coming generation as far\r\nas in me lay. You will now do the same for those who come after you,\r\nand you can treble it, since you are going to rich countries.\" Then he\r\nhad added with a smile, \"They come here seeking wealth, go you to their\r\ncountry to seek also that other wealth which we lack! But remember\r\nthat all that glitters is not gold.\" The old man had died on that spot.\r\n\r\nAt these recollections the youth murmured audibly: \"No, in spite of\r\neverything, the fatherland first, first the Philippines, the child\r\nof Spain, first the Spanish fatherland! No, that which is decreed by\r\nfate does not tarnish the honor of the fatherland, no!\"\r\n\r\nHe gave little heed to Ermita, the phenix of nipa that had rearisen\r\nfrom its ashes under the form of blue and white houses with red-painted\r\nroofs of corrugated iron. Nor was his attention caught by Malate,\r\nneither by the cavalry barracks with the spreading trees in front,\r\nnor by the inhabitants or their little nipa huts, pyramidal or\r\nprismatic in shape, hidden away among the banana plants and areca\r\npalms, constructed like nests by each father of a family.\r\n\r\nThe carriage continued on its way, meeting now and then carromatas\r\ndrawn by one or two ponies whose abaka harness indicated that they\r\nwere from the country. The drivers would try to catch a glimpse of the\r\noccupant of the fine carriage, but would pass on without exchanging a\r\nword, without a single salute. At times a heavy cart drawn by a slow\r\nand indifferent carabao would appear on the dusty road over which beat\r\nthe brilliant sunlight of the tropics. The mournful and monotonous song\r\nof the driver mounted on the back of the carabao would be mingled at\r\none time with the screechings of a dry wheel on the huge axle of the\r\nheavy vehicle or at another time with the dull scraping of worn-out\r\nrunners on a sledge which was dragged heavily through the dust, and\r\nover the ruts in the road. In the fields and wide meadows the herds\r\nwere grazing, attended ever by the white buffalo-birds which roosted\r\npeacefully on the backs of the animals while these chewed their cuds\r\nor browsed in lazy contentment upon the rich grass. In the distance\r\nponies frisked, jumping and running about, pursued by the lively colts\r\nwith long tails and abundant manes who whinnied and pawed the ground\r\nwith their hard hoofs.\r\n\r\nLet us leave the youth dreaming or dozing, since neither the sad\r\nnor the animated poetry of the open country held his attention. For\r\nhim there was no charm in the sun that gleamed upon the tops of the\r\ntrees and caused the rustics, with feet burned by the hot ground in\r\nspite of their callousness, to hurry along, or that made the villager\r\npause beneath the shade of an almond tree or a bamboo brake while he\r\npondered upon vague and inexplicable things. While the youth's carriage\r\nsways along like a drunken thing on account of the inequalities in\r\nthe surface of the road when passing over a bamboo bridge or going\r\nup an incline or descending a steep slope, let us return to Manila.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nLocal Affairs\r\n\r\n\r\nIbarra had not been mistaken about the occupant of the victoria,\r\nfor it was indeed Padre Damaso, and he was on his way to the house\r\nwhich the youth had just left.\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going?\" asked the friar of Maria Clara and Aunt Isabel,\r\nwho were about to enter a silver-mounted carriage. In the midst of\r\nhis preoccupation Padre Damaso stroked the maiden's cheek lightly.\r\n\r\n\"To the convent to get my things,\" answered the latter.\r\n\r\n\"Ahaa! Aha! We'll see who's stronger, we'll see,\" muttered the friar\r\nabstractedly, as with bowed head and slow step he turned to the\r\nstairway, leaving the two women not a little amazed.\r\n\r\n\"He must have a sermon to preach and is memorizing it,\" commented\r\nAunt Isabel. \"Get in, Maria, or we'll be late.\"\r\n\r\nWhether or not Padre Damaso was preparing a sermon we cannot say,\r\nbut it is certain that some grave matter filled his mind, for he did\r\nnot extend his hand to Capitan Tiago, who had almost to get down on\r\nhis knees to kiss it.\r\n\r\n\"Santiago,\" said the friar at once, \"I have an important matter to\r\ntalk to you about. Let's go into your office.\"\r\n\r\nCapitan Tiago began to feel uneasy, so much so that he did not know\r\nwhat to say; but he obeyed, following the heavy figure of the priest,\r\nwho closed the door behind him.\r\n\r\nWhile they confer in secret, let us learn what Fray Sibyla has\r\nbeen doing. The astute Dominican is not at the rectory, for very\r\nsoon after celebrating mass he had gone to the convent of his order,\r\nsituated just inside the gate of Isabel II, or of Magellan, according\r\nto what family happened to be reigning in Madrid. Without paying any\r\nattention to the rich odor of chocolate, or to the rattle of boxes\r\nand coins which came from the treasury, and scarcely acknowledging\r\nthe respectful and deferential salute of the procurator-brother,\r\nhe entered, passed along several corridors, and knocked at a door.\r\n\r\n\"Come in,\" sighed a weak voice.\r\n\r\n\"May God restore health to your Reverence,\" was the young Dominican's\r\ngreeting as he entered.\r\n\r\nSeated in a large armchair was an aged priest, wasted and rather\r\nsallow, like the saints that Rivera painted. His eyes were sunken in\r\ntheir hollow sockets, over which his heavy eyebrows were almost always\r\ncontracted, thus accentuating their brilliant gleam. Padre Sibyla,\r\nwith his arms crossed under the venerable scapulary of St. Dominic,\r\ngazed at him feelingly, then bowed his head and waited in silence.\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" sighed the old man, \"they advise an operation, an operation,\r\nHernando, at my age! This country, O this terrible country! Take\r\nwarning from my ease, Hernando!\"\r\n\r\nFray Sibyla raised his eyes slowly and fixed them on the sick man's\r\nface. \"What has your Reverence decided to do?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"To die! Ah, what else can I do? I am suffering too much, but--I\r\nhave made many suffer, I am paying my debt! And how are you? What\r\nhas brought you here?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've come to talk about the business which you committed to my care.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! What about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pish!\" answered the young man disgustedly, as he seated himself\r\nand turned away his face with a contemptuous expression, \"They've\r\nbeen telling us fairy tales. Young Ibarra is a youth of discernment;\r\nhe doesn't seem to be a fool, but I believe that he is a good lad.\"\r\n\r\n\"You believe so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hostilities began last night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Already? How?\"\r\n\r\nFray Sibyla then recounted briefly what had taken place between Padre\r\nDamaso and Ibarra. \"Besides,\" he said in conclusion, \"the young man\r\nis going to marry Capitan Tiago's daughter, who was educated in the\r\ncollege of our Sisterhood. He's rich, and won't care to make enemies\r\nand to run the risk of ruining his fortune and his happiness.\"\r\n\r\nThe sick man nodded in agreement. \"Yes, I think as you do. With a wife\r\nlike that and such a father-in-law, we'll own him body and soul. If\r\nnot, so much the better for him to declare himself an enemy of ours.\"\r\n\r\nFray Sibyla looked at the old man in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"For the good of our holy Order, I mean, of course,\" he added,\r\nbreathing heavily. \"I prefer open attacks to the silly praises and\r\nflatteries of friends, which are really paid for.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does your Reverence think--\"\r\n\r\nThe old man regarded him sadly. \"Keep it clearly before you,\" he\r\nanswered, gasping for breath. \"Our power will last as long as it\r\nis believed in. If they attack us, the government will say, 'They\r\nattack them because they see in them an obstacle to their liberty,\r\nso then let us preserve them.'\"\r\n\r\n\"But if it should listen to them? Sometimes the government--\"\r\n\r\n\"It will not listen!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, if, led on by cupidity, it should come to wish for\r\nitself what we are taking in--if there should be some bold and\r\ndaring one--\"\r\n\r\n\"Then woe unto that one!\"\r\n\r\nBoth remained silent for a time, then the sick man continued:\r\n\"Besides, we need their attacks, to keep us awake; that makes us see\r\nour weaknesses so that we may remedy them. Exaggerated flattery will\r\ndeceive us and put us to sleep, while outside our walls we shall be\r\nlaughed at, and the day in which we become an object of ridicule, we\r\nshall fall as we fell in Europe. Money will not flow into our churches,\r\nno one will buy our scapularies or girdles or anything else, and when\r\nwe cease to be rich we shall no longer be able to control consciences.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we shall always have our estates, our property.\"\r\n\r\n\"All will be lost as we lost them in Europe! And the worst of it is\r\nthat we are working toward our own ruin. For example, this unrestrained\r\neagerness to raise arbitrarily the rents on our lands each year,\r\nthis eagerness which I have so vainly combated in all the chapters,\r\nthis will ruin us! The native sees himself obliged to purchase farms\r\nin other places, which bring him as good returns as ours, or better. I\r\nfear that we are already on the decline; _quos vult perdere Jupiter\r\ndementat prius_. [49] For this reason we should not increase our\r\nburden; the people are already murmuring. You have decided well:\r\nlet us leave the others to settle their accounts in that quarter;\r\nlet us preserve the prestige that remains to us, and as we shall soon\r\nappear before God, let us wash our hands of it--and may the God of\r\nmercy have pity on our weakness!\"\r\n\r\n\"So your Reverence thinks that the rent or tax--\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's not talk any more about money,\" interrupted the sick man with\r\nsigns of disgust. \"You say that the lieutenant threatened to Padre\r\nDamaso that--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Padre,\" broke in Fray Sibyla with a faint smile, \"but this\r\nmorning I saw him and he told me that he was sorry for what occurred\r\nlast night, that the sherry had gone to his head, and that he believed\r\nthat Padre Damaso was in the same condition. 'And your threat?' I\r\nasked him jokingly. 'Padre,' he answered me, 'I know how to keep my\r\nword when my honor is affected, but I am not nor have ever been an\r\ninformer--for that reason I wear only two stars.'\"\r\n\r\nAfter they had conversed a while longer on unimportant subjects,\r\nFray Sibyla took his departure.\r\n\r\nIt was true that the lieutenant had not gone to the Palace, but the\r\nCaptain-General heard what had occurred. While talking with some\r\nof his aides about the allusions that the Manila newspapers were\r\nmaking to him under the names of comets and celestial apparitions,\r\none of them told him about the affair of Padre Damaso, with a somewhat\r\nheightened coloring although substantially correct as to matter.\r\n\r\n\"From whom did you learn this?\" asked his Excellency, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"From Laruja, who was telling it this morning in the office.\"\r\n\r\nThe Captain-General again smiled and said: \"A woman or a friar can't\r\ninsult one. I contemplate living in peace for the time that I shall\r\nremain in this country and I don't want any more quarrels with men who\r\nwear skirts. Besides, I've learned that the Provincial has scoffed\r\nat my orders. I asked for the removal of this friar as a punishment\r\nand they transferred him to a better town 'monkish tricks,' as we\r\nsay in Spain.\"\r\n\r\nBut when his Excellency found himself alone he stopped smiling. \"Ah,\r\nif this people were not so stupid, I would put a curb on their\r\nReverences,\" he sighed to himself. \"But every people deserves its fate,\r\nso let's do as everybody else does.\"\r\n\r\nCapitan Tiago, meanwhile, had concluded his interview with Padre\r\nDamaso, or rather, to speak more exactly, Padre Damaso had concluded\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\n\"So now you are warned!\" said the Franciscan on leaving. \"All this\r\ncould have been avoided if you had consulted me beforehand, if you had\r\nnot lied when I asked you. Try not to play any more foolish tricks,\r\nand trust your protector.\"\r\n\r\nCapitan Tiago walked up and down the sala a few times, meditating\r\nand sighing. Suddenly, as if a happy thought had occurred to him,\r\nhe ran to the oratory and extinguished the candles and the lamp that\r\nhad been lighted for Ibarra's safety. \"The way is long and there's\r\nyet time,\" he muttered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nThe Town\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost on the margin of the lake, in the midst of meadows and\r\npaddy-fields, lies the town of San Diego. [50] From it sugar, rice,\r\ncoffee, and fruits are either exported or sold for a small part of\r\ntheir value to the Chinese, who exploit the simplicity and vices of\r\nthe native farmers.\r\n\r\nWhen on a clear day the boys ascend to the upper part of the church\r\ntower, which is beautified by moss and creeping plants, they break\r\nout into joyful exclamations at the beauty of the scene spread out\r\nbefore them. In the midst of the clustering roofs of nipa, tiles,\r\ncorrugated iron, and palm leaves, separated by groves and gardens,\r\neach one is able to discover his own home, his little nest. Everything\r\nserves as a mark: a tree, that tamarind with its light foliage,\r\nthat coco palm laden with nuts, like the Astarte Genetrix, or the\r\nDiana of Ephesus with her numerous breasts, a bending bamboo, an\r\nareca palm, or a cross. Yonder is the river, a huge glassy serpent\r\nsleeping on a green carpet, with rocks, scattered here and there\r\nalong its sandy channel, that break its current into ripples. There,\r\nthe bed is narrowed between high banks to which the gnarled trees\r\ncling with bared roots; here, it becomes a gentle slope where the\r\nstream widens and eddies about. Farther away, a small hut built on the\r\nedge of the high bank seems to defy the winds, the heights and the\r\ndepths, presenting with its slender posts the appearance of a huge,\r\nlong-legged bird watching for a reptile to seize upon. Trunks of palm\r\nor other trees with their bark still on them unite the banks by a\r\nshaky and infirm foot-bridge which, if not a very secure crossing,\r\nis nevertheless a wonderful contrivance for gymnastic exercises in\r\npreserving one's balance, a thing not to be despised. The boys bathing\r\nin the river are amused by the difficulties of the old woman crossing\r\nwith a basket on her head or by the antics of the old man who moves\r\ntremblingly and loses his staff in the water.\r\n\r\nBut that which always attracts particular notice is what might be\r\ncalled a peninsula of forest in the sea of cultivated fields. There\r\nin that wood are century-old trees with hollow trunks, which die only\r\nwhen their high tops are struck and set on fire by the lightning--and\r\nit is said that the fire always checks itself and dies out in the same\r\nspot. There are huge points of rock which time and nature are clothing\r\nwith velvet garments of moss. Layer after layer of dust settles in\r\nthe hollows, the rains beat it down, and the birds bring seeds. The\r\ntropical vegetation spreads out luxuriantly in thickets and underbrush,\r\nwhile curtains of interwoven vines hang from the branches of the trees\r\nand twine about their roots or spread along the ground, as if Flora\r\nwere not yet satisfied but must place plant above plant. Mosses and\r\nfungi live upon the cracked trunks, and orchids--graceful guests--twine\r\nin loving embrace with the foliage of the hospitable trees.\r\n\r\nStrange legends exist concerning this wood, which is held in awe by\r\nthe country folk. The most credible account, and therefore the one\r\nleast known and believed, seems to be this. When the town was still\r\na collection of miserable huts with the grass growing abundantly in\r\nthe so-called streets, at the time when the wild boar and deer roamed\r\nabout during the nights, there arrived in the place one day an old,\r\nhollow-eyed Spaniard, who spoke Tagalog rather well. After looking\r\nabout and inspecting the land, he finally inquired for the owners of\r\nthis wood, in which there were hot springs. Some persons who claimed to\r\nbe such presented themselves, and the old man acquired it in exchange\r\nfor clothes, jewels, and a sum of money. Soon afterward he disappeared\r\nmysteriously. The people thought that he had been spirited away,\r\nwhen a bad odor from the neighboring wood attracted the attention of\r\nsome herdsmen. Tracing this, they found the decaying corpse of the\r\nold Spaniard hanging from the branch of a balete tree. [51] In life\r\nhe had inspired fear by his deep, hollow voice, his sunken eyes, and\r\nhis mirthless laugh, but now, dead by his own act, he disturbed the\r\nsleep of the women. Some threw the jewels into the river and burned the\r\nclothes, and from the time that the corpse was buried at the foot of\r\nthe balete itself, no one willingly ventured near the spot. A belated\r\nherdsman looking for some of his strayed charges told of lights that\r\nhe had seen there, and when some venturesome youths went to the place\r\nthey heard mournful cries. To win the smiles of his disdainful lady,\r\na forlorn lover agreed to spend the night there and in proof to wrap\r\naround the trunk a long piece of rattan, but he died of a quick fever\r\nthat seized him the very next day. Stories and legends still cluster\r\nabout the place.\r\n\r\nA few months after the finding of the old Spaniard's body there\r\nappeared a youth, apparently a Spanish mestizo, who said that\r\nhe was the son of the deceased. He established himself in the\r\nplace and devoted his attention to agriculture, especially the\r\nraising of indigo. Don Saturnino was a silent young man with a\r\nviolent disposition, even cruel at times, yet he was energetic and\r\nindustrious. He surrounded the grave of his father with a wall,\r\nbut visited it only at rare intervals. When he was along in years,\r\nhe married a young woman from Manila, and she became the mother of\r\nDon Rafael, the father of Crisostomo. From his youth Don Rafael was a\r\nfavorite with the country people. The agricultural methods introduced\r\nand encouraged by his father spread rapidly, new settlers poured in,\r\nthe Chinese came, and the settlement became a village with a native\r\npriest. Later the village grew into a town, the priest died, and Fray\r\nDamaso came.\r\n\r\nAll this time the tomb and the land around it remained\r\nunmolested. Sometimes a crowd of boys armed with clubs and stones would\r\nbecome bold enough to wander into the place to gather guavas, papayas,\r\nlomboy, and other fruits, but it frequently happened that when their\r\nsport was at its height, or while they gazed in awed silence at the\r\nrotting piece of rope which still swung from the branch, stones would\r\nfall, coming from they knew not where. Then with cries of \"The old\r\nman! The old man!\" they would throw away fruit and clubs, jump from\r\nthe trees, and hurry between the rocks and through the thickets;\r\nnor would they stop running until they were well out of the wood,\r\nsome pale and breathless, others weeping, and only a few laughing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nThe Rulers\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDivide and rule.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(_The New Machiavelli._)\r\n\r\n\r\nWho were the caciques of the town?\r\n\r\nDon Rafael, when alive, even though he was the richest, owned more\r\nland, and was the patron of nearly everybody, had not been one of\r\nthem. As he was modest and depreciated the value of his own deeds,\r\nno faction in his favor had ever been formed in the town, and we\r\nhave already seen how the people all rose up against him when they\r\nsaw him hesitate upon being attacked.\r\n\r\nCould it be Capitan Tiago? True it was that when he went there he\r\nwas received with an orchestra by his debtors, who banqueted him and\r\nheaped gifts upon him. The finest fruits burdened his table and a\r\nquarter of deer or wild boar was his share of the hunt. If he found\r\nthe horse of a debtor beautiful, half an hour afterwards it was in\r\nhis stable. All this was true, but they laughed at him behind his\r\nback and in secret called him \"Sacristan Tiago.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was the gobernadorcillo? [52] No, for he was only an\r\nunhappy mortal who commanded not, but obeyed; who ordered not, but\r\nwas ordered; who drove not, but was driven. Nevertheless, he had\r\nto answer to the alcalde for having commanded, ordered, and driven,\r\njust as if he were the originator of everything. Yet be it said to\r\nhis credit that he had never presumed upon or usurped such honors,\r\nwhich had cost him five thousand pesos and many humiliations. But\r\nconsidering the income it brought him, it was cheap.\r\n\r\nWell then, might it be God? Ah, the good God disturbed neither the\r\nconsciences nor the sleep of the inhabitants. At least, He did not\r\nmake them tremble, and if by chance He might have been mentioned in\r\na sermon, surely they would have sighed longingly, \"Oh, that only\r\nthere were a God!\" To the good Lord they paid little attention, as\r\nthe saints gave them enough to do. For those poor folk God had come\r\nto be like those unfortunate monarchs who are surrounded by courtiers\r\nto whom alone the people render homage.\r\n\r\nSan Diego was a kind of Rome: not the Rome of the time when the cunning\r\nRomulus laid out its walls with a plow, nor of the later time when,\r\nbathed in its own and others' blood, it dictated laws to the world--no,\r\nit was a Rome of our own times with the difference that in place of\r\nmarble monuments and colosseums it had its monuments of sawali and its\r\ncockpit of nipa. The curate was the Pope in the Vatican; the alferez\r\nof the Civil Guard, the King of Italy on the Quirinal: all, it must be\r\nunderstood, on a scale of nipa and bamboo. Here, as there, continual\r\nquarreling went on, since each wished to be the master and considered\r\nthe other an intruder. Let us examine the characteristics of each.\r\n\r\nFray Bernardo Salvi was that silent young Franciscan of whom we\r\nhave spoken before. In his habits and manners he was quite different\r\nfrom his brethren and even from his predecessor, the violent Padre\r\nDamaso. He was thin and sickly, habitually pensive, strict in the\r\nfulfilment of his religious duties, and careful of his good name. In\r\na month after his arrival nearly every one in the town had joined\r\nthe Venerable Tertiary Order, to the great distress of its rival,\r\nthe Society of the Holy Rosary. His soul leaped with joy to see about\r\neach neck four or five scapularies and around each waist a knotted\r\ngirdle, and to behold the procession of corpses and ghosts in _guingón_\r\nhabits. The senior sacristan made a small fortune selling--or giving\r\naway as alms, we should say--all things necessary for the salvation\r\nof the soul and the warfare against the devil, as it is well known\r\nthat this spirit, which formerly had the temerity to contradict God\r\nhimself face to face and to doubt His words, as is related in the\r\nholy book of Job, who carried our Lord Christ through the air as\r\nafterwards in the Dark Ages he carried the ghosts, and continues,\r\naccording to report, to carry the _asuang_ of the Philippines, now\r\nseems to have become so shamefaced that he cannot endure the sight of\r\na piece of painted cloth and that he fears the knots on a cord. But\r\nall this proves nothing more than that there is progress on this side\r\nalso and that the devil is backward, or at least a conservative,\r\nas are all who dwell in darkness. Otherwise, we must attribute to\r\nhim the weakness of a fifteen-year-old girl.\r\n\r\nAs we have said, Fray Salvi was very assiduous in the fulfilment of his\r\nduties, too assiduous, the alferez thought. While he was preaching--he\r\nwas very fond of preaching--the doors of the church were closed,\r\nwherein he was like Nero, who allowed no one to leave the theater while\r\nhe was singing. But the former did it for the salvation and the latter\r\nfor the corruption of souls. Fray Salvi rarely resorted to blows,\r\nbut was accustomed to punish every shortcoming of his subordinates\r\nwith fines. In this respect he was very different from Padre Damaso,\r\nwho had been accustomed to settle everything with his fists or a cane,\r\nadministering such chastisement with the greatest good-will. For this,\r\nhowever, he should not be judged too harshly, as he was firm in the\r\nbelief that the Indian could be managed only by beating him, just\r\nas was affirmed by a friar who knew enough to write books, and Padre\r\nDamaso never disputed anything that he saw in print, a credulity of\r\nwhich many might have reason to complain. Although Fray Salvi made\r\nlittle use of violence, yet, as an old wiseacre of the town said,\r\nwhat he lacked in quantity he made up in quality. But this should\r\nnot be counted against him, for the fasts and abstinences thinned his\r\nblood and unstrung his nerves and, as the people said, the wind got\r\ninto his head. Thus it came about that it was not possible to learn\r\nfrom the condition of the sacristans' backs whether the curate was\r\nfasting or feasting.\r\n\r\nThe only rival of this spiritual power, with tendencies toward the\r\ntemporal, was, as we have said, the alferez: the only one, since the\r\nwomen told how the devil himself would flee from the curate, because,\r\nhaving one day dared to tempt him, he was caught, tied to a bedpost,\r\nsoundly whipped with a rope, and set at liberty only after nine\r\ndays. As a consequence, any one who after this would still be the\r\nenemy of such a man, deserved to fall into worse repute than even\r\nthe weak and unwary devils.\r\n\r\nBut the alferez deserved his fate. His wife was an old Filipina of\r\nabundant rouge and paint, known as Doña Consolacion--although her\r\nhusband and some others called her by quite another name. The alferez\r\nrevenged his conjugal misfortunes on his own person by getting so\r\ndrunk that he made a tank of himself, or by ordering his soldiers to\r\ndrill in the sun while he remained in the shade, or, more frequently,\r\nby beating up his consort, who, if she was not a lamb of God to\r\ntake away one's sins, at least served to lay up for her spouse many\r\ntorments in Purgatory--if perchance he should get there, a matter of\r\ndoubt to the devout women. As if for the fun of it, these two used to\r\nbeat each other up beautifully, giving free shows to the neighborhood\r\nwith vocal and instrumental accompaniments, four-handed, soft, loud,\r\nwith pedal and all.\r\n\r\nWhenever these scandals reached the ears of Padre Salvi, he would\r\nsmile, cross himself, and recite a paternoster. They called him a\r\ngrafter, a hypocrite, a Carlist, and a miser: he merely smiled and\r\nrecited more prayers. The alferez had a little anecdote which he\r\nalways related to the occasional Spaniards who visited him:\r\n\r\n\"Are you going over to the convento to visit the sanctimonious rascal\r\nthere, the little curate? Yes! Well, if he offers you chocolate which\r\nI doubt--but if he offers it remember this: if he calls to the servant\r\nand says, 'Juan, make a cup of chocolate, _eh!_' then stay without\r\nfear; but if he calls out, 'Juan, make a cup of chocolate, _ah!_'\r\nthen take your hat and leave on a run.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" the startled visitor would ask, \"does he poison\r\npeople? _Carambas!_\"\r\n\r\n\"No, man, not at all!\"\r\n\r\n\"What then?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Chocolate_, eh!_' means thick and rich, while 'chocolate, _ah!_'\r\nmeans watered and thin.\"\r\n\r\nBut we are of the opinion that this was a slander on the part of\r\nthe alferez, since the same story is told of many curates. At least,\r\nit may be a thing peculiar to the Order.\r\n\r\nTo make trouble for the curate, the soldier, at the instigation of his\r\nwife, would prohibit any one from walking abroad after nine o'clock at\r\nnight. Doña Consolacion would then claim that she had seen the curate,\r\ndisguised in a piña camisa and salakot, walking about late. Fray Salvi\r\nwould take his revenge in a holy manner. Upon seeing the alferez enter\r\nthe church he would innocently order the sacristan to close all the\r\ndoors, and would then go up into the pulpit and preach until the very\r\nsaints closed their eyes and even the wooden dove above his head,\r\nthe image of the Holy Ghost, murmured for mercy. But the alferez,\r\nlike all the unregenerate, did not change his ways for this; he would\r\ngo away cursing, and as soon as he was able to catch a sacristan, or\r\none of the curate's servants, he would arrest him, give him a beating,\r\nand make him scrub the floor of the barracks and that of his own house,\r\nwhich at such times was put in a decent condition. On going to pay\r\nthe fine imposed by the curate for his absence, the sacristan would\r\nexplain the cause. Fray Salvi would listen in silence, take the money,\r\nand at once turn out his goats and sheep so that they might graze\r\nin the alferez's garden, while he himself looked up a new text for\r\nanother longer and more edifying sermon. But these were only little\r\npleasantries, and if the two chanced to meet they would shake hands\r\nand converse politely.\r\n\r\nWhen her husband was sleeping off the wine he had drunk, or was\r\nsnoring through the siesta, and she could not quarrel with him, Doña\r\nConsolacion, in a blue flannel camisa, with a big cigar in her mouth,\r\nwould take her stand at the window. She could not endure the young\r\npeople, so from there she would scrutinize and mock the passing girls,\r\nwho, being afraid of her, would hurry by in confusion, holding their\r\nbreath the while, and not daring to raise their eyes. One great virtue\r\nDoña Consolation possessed, and this was that she had evidently never\r\nlooked in a mirror.\r\n\r\nThese were the rulers of the town of San Diego.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nAll Saints\r\n\r\n\r\nThe one thing perhaps that indisputably distinguishes man from the\r\nbrute creation is the attention which he pays to those who have passed\r\naway and, wonder of wonders! this characteristic seems to be more\r\ndeeply rooted in proportion to the lack of civilization. Historians\r\nrelate that the ancient inhabitants of the Philippines venerated and\r\ndeified their ancestors; but now the contrary is true, and the dead\r\nhave to entrust themselves to the living. It is also related that\r\nthe people of New Guinea preserve the bones of their dead in chests\r\nand maintain communication with them. The greater part of the peoples\r\nof Asia, Africa, and America offer them the finest products of their\r\nkitchens or dishes of what was their favorite food when alive, and\r\ngive banquets at which they believe them to be present. The Egyptians\r\nraised up palaces and the Mussulmans built shrines, but the masters\r\nin these things, those who have most clearly read the human heart,\r\nare the people of Dahomey. These negroes know that man is revengeful,\r\nso they consider that nothing will more content the dead than to\r\nsacrifice all his enemies upon his grave, and, as man is curious and\r\nmay not know how to entertain himself in the other life, each year\r\nthey send him a newsletter under the skin of a beheaded slave.\r\n\r\nWe ourselves differ from all the rest. In spite of the inscriptions on\r\nthe tombs, hardly any one believes that the dead rest, and much less,\r\nthat they rest in peace. The most optimistic fancies his forefathers\r\nstill roasting in purgatory and, if it turns out that he himself be\r\nnot completely damned, he will yet be able to associate with them for\r\nmany years. If any one would contradict let him visit the churches and\r\ncemeteries of the country on All Saints' day and he will be convinced.\r\n\r\nNow that we are in San Diego let us visit its cemetery, which is\r\nlocated in the midst of paddy-fields, there toward the west--not a\r\ncity, merely a village of the dead, approached by a path dusty in dry\r\nweather and navigable on rainy days. A wooden gate and a fence half\r\nof stone and half of bamboo stakes, appear to separate it from the\r\nabode of the living but not from the curate's goats and some of the\r\npigs of the neighborhood, who come and go making explorations among the\r\ntombs and enlivening the solitude with their presence. In the center of\r\nthis enclosure rises a large wooden cross set on a stone pedestal. The\r\nstorms have doubled over the tin plate for the inscription INRI, and\r\nthe rains have effaced the letters. At the foot of the cross, as on\r\nthe real Golgotha, is a confused heap of skulls and bones which the\r\nindifferent grave-digger has thrown from the graves he digs, and there\r\nthey will probably await, not the resurrection of the dead, but the\r\ncoming of the animals to defile them. Round about may be noted signs\r\nof recent excavations; here the earth is sunken, there it forms a low\r\nmound. There grow in all their luxuriance the _tarambulo_ to prick\r\nthe feet with its spiny berries and the _pandakaki_ to add its odor\r\nto that of the cemetery, as if the place did not have smells enough\r\nalready. Yet the ground is sprinkled with a few little flowers which,\r\nlike those skulls, are known only to their Creator; their petals wear\r\na pale smile and their fragrance is the fragrance of the tombs. The\r\ngrass and creepers fill up the corners or climb over the walls and\r\nniches to cover and beautify the naked ugliness and in places even\r\npenetrate into the fissures made by the earthquakes, so as to hide\r\nfrom sight the revered hollowness of the sepulcher.\r\n\r\nAt the time we enter, the people have driven the animals away, with the\r\nsingle exception of some old hog, an animal that is hard to convince,\r\nwho shows his small eyes and pulling back his head from a great gap\r\nin the fence, sticks up his snout and seems to say to a woman praying\r\nnear, \"Don't eat it all, leave something for me, won't you?\"\r\n\r\nTwo men are digging a grave near one of the tottering walls. One\r\nof them, the grave-digger, works with indifference, throwing about\r\nbones as a gardener does stones and dry branches, while the other,\r\nmore intent on his work, is perspiring, smoking, and spitting at\r\nevery moment.\r\n\r\n\"Listen,\" says the latter in Tagalog, \"wouldn't it be better for us\r\nto dig in some other place? This is too recent.\"\r\n\r\n\"One grave is as recent as another.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't stand it any longer! That bone you're just cut in two has\r\nblood oozing from it--and those hairs?\"\r\n\r\n\"But how sensitive you are!\" was the other's reproach. \"Just as if\r\nyou were a town clerk! If, like myself, you had dug up a corpse of\r\ntwenty days, on a dark and rainy night--! My lantern went out--\"\r\n\r\nHis companion shuddered.\r\n\r\n\"The coffin burst open, the corpse fell half-way out, it stunk--and\r\nsupposing you had to carry it--the rain wet us both--\"\r\n\r\n\"Ugh! And why did you dig it up?\"\r\n\r\nThe grave-digger looked at him in surprise. \"Why? How do I know? I\r\nwas ordered to do so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who ordered you?\"\r\n\r\nThe grave-digger stepped backward and looked his companion over from\r\nhead to foot. \"Man, you're like a Spaniard, for afterwards a Spaniard\r\nasked me the same questions, but in secret. So I'm going to answer\r\nyou as I answered the Spaniard: the fat curate ordered me to do so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! And what did you do with the corpse afterwards?\" further\r\nquestioned the sensitive one.\r\n\r\n\"The devil! If I didn't know you and was not sure that you are a _man_\r\nI would say that you were certainly a Spaniard of the Civil Guard,\r\nsince you ask questions just as he did. Well, the fat curate ordered\r\nme to bury it in the Chinamen's cemetery, but the coffin was heavy\r\nand the Chinese cemetery far away--\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no! I'm not going to dig any more!\" the other interrupted in\r\nhorror as he threw away his spade and jumped out of the hole. \"I've cut\r\na skull in two and I'm afraid that it won't let me sleep tonight.\" The\r\nold grave-digger laughed to see how the chicken-hearted fellow left,\r\ncrossing himself.\r\n\r\nThe cemetery was filling up with men and women dressed in\r\nmourning. Some sought a grave for a time, disputing among themselves\r\nthe while, and as if they were unable to agree, they scattered\r\nabout, each kneeling where he thought best. Others, who had niches\r\nfor their deceased relatives, lighted candles and fell to praying\r\ndevoutly. Exaggerated or suppressed sighs and sobs were heard amid\r\nthe hum of prayers, _orapreo, orapreiss, requiem-aeternams_, that\r\narose from all sides.\r\n\r\nA little old man with bright eyes entered bareheaded. Upon seeing\r\nhim many laughed, and some women knitted their eyebrows. The old man\r\ndid not seem to pay any attention to these demonstrations as he went\r\ntoward a pile of skulls and knelt to look earnestly for something\r\namong the bones. Then he carefully removed the skulls one by one, but\r\napparently without finding what he sought, for he wrinkled his brow,\r\nnodded his head from side to side, looked all about him, and finally\r\nrose and approached the grave-digger, who raised his head when the\r\nold man spoke to him.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know where there is a beautiful skull, white as the meat of a\r\ncoconut, with a complete set of teeth, which I had there at the foot\r\nof the cross under those leaves?\"\r\n\r\nThe grave-digger shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"Look!\" added the old man, showing a silver coin, \"I have only this,\r\nbut I'll give it to you if you find the skull for me.\"\r\n\r\nThe gleam of the silver caused the grave-digger to consider, and\r\nstaring toward the heap of bones he said, \"Isn't it there? No? Then\r\nI don't know where it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you know? When those who owe me pay me, I'll give you more,\"\r\ncontinued the old man. \"It was the skull of my wife, so if you find\r\nit for me--\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it there? Then I don't know! But if you wish, I can give\r\nyou another.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're like the grave you're digging,\" apostrophized the old man\r\nnervously. \"You don't know the value of what you lose. For whom is\r\nthat grave?\"\r\n\r\n\"How should I know?\" replied the other in bad humor.\r\n\r\n\"For a corpse!\"\r\n\r\n\"Like the grave, like the grave!\" repeated the old man with a dry\r\nsmile. \"You don't know what you throw away nor what you receive! Dig,\r\ndig on!\" And he turned away in the direction of the gate.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the grave-digger had completed his task, attested by the\r\ntwo mounds of fresh red earth at the sides of the grave. He took some\r\nbuyo from his salakot and began to chew it while he stared stupidly\r\nat what was going on around him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nSigns of Storm\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the old man was leaving the cemetery there stopped at the head\r\nof the path a carriage which, from its dust-covered appearance and\r\nsweating horses, seemed to have come from a great distance. Followed\r\nby an aged servant, Ibarra left the carriage and dismissed it with a\r\nwave of his hand, then gravely and silently turned toward the cemetery.\r\n\r\n\"My illness and my duties have not permitted me to return,\" said the\r\nold servant timidly. \"Capitan Tiago promised that he would see that\r\na niche was constructed, but I planted some flowers on the grave and\r\nset up a cross carved by my own hands.\" Ibarra made no reply. \"There\r\nbehind that big cross, sir,\" he added when they were well inside the\r\ngate, as he pointed to the place.\r\n\r\nIbarra was so intent upon his quest that he did not notice the\r\nmovement of surprise on the part of the persons who recognized him\r\nand suspended their prayers to watch him curiously. He walked along\r\ncarefully to avoid stepping on any of the graves, which were easily\r\ndistinguishable by the hollow places in the soil. In other times he\r\nhad walked on them carelessly, but now they were to be respected:\r\nhis father lay among them. When he reached the large cross he stopped\r\nand looked all around. His companion stood confused and confounded,\r\nseeking some mark in the ground, but nowhere was any cross to be seen.\r\n\r\n\"Was it here?\" he murmured through his teeth. \"No, there! But the\r\nground has been disturbed.\"\r\n\r\nIbarra gave him a look of anguish.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he went on, \"I remember that there was a stone near it. The\r\ngrave was rather short. The grave-digger was sick, so a farmer had\r\nto dig it. But let's ask that man what has become of the cross.\"\r\n\r\nThey went over to where the grave-digger was watching them with\r\ncuriosity. He removed his salakot respectfully as they approached.\r\n\r\n\"Can you tell me which is the grave there that had a cross over\r\nit?\" asked the servant.\r\n\r\nThe grave-digger looked toward the place and reflected. \"A big cross?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, a big one!\" affirmed the servant eagerly, with a significant\r\nlook at Ibarra, whose face lighted up.\r\n\r\n\"A carved cross tied up with rattan?\" continued the grave-digger.\r\n\r\n\"That's it, that's it, like this!\" exclaimed the servant in answer\r\nas he drew on the ground the figure of a Byzantine cross.\r\n\r\n\"Were there flowers scattered on the grave?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oleanders and tuberoses and forget-me-nots, yes!\" the servant added\r\njoyfully, offering the grave-digger a cigar.\r\n\r\n\"Tell us which is the grave and where the cross is.\"\r\n\r\nThe grave-digger scratched his ear and answered with a yawn: \"Well,\r\nas for the cross, I burned it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Burned it? Why did you burn it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because the fat curate ordered me to do so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is the fat curate?\" asked Ibarra.\r\n\r\n\"Who? Why, the one that beats people with a big cane.\"\r\n\r\nIbarra drew his hand across his forehead. \"But at least you can tell\r\nus where the grave is. You must remember that.\"\r\n\r\nThe grave-digger smiled as he answered quietly, \"But the corpse is\r\nno longer there.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that you're saying?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" continued the grave-digger in a half-jesting tone. \"I buried\r\na woman in that place a week ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you crazy?\" cried the servant. \"It hasn't been a year since we\r\nburied him.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's very true, but a good many months ago I dug the body up. The\r\nfat curate ordered me to do so and to take it to the cemetery of the\r\nChinamen. But as it was heavy and there was rain that night--\"\r\n\r\nHe was stopped by the threatening attitude of Ibarra, who had caught\r\nhim by the arm and was shaking him. \"Did you do that?\" demanded the\r\nyouth in an indescribable tone.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be angry, sir,\" stammered the pale and trembling\r\ngrave-digger. \"I didn't bury him among the Chinamen. Better be drowned\r\nthan lie among Chinamen, I said to myself, so I threw the body into\r\nthe lake.\"\r\n\r\nIbarra placed both his hands on the grave-digger's shoulders and\r\nstared at him for a long time with an indefinable expression. Then,\r\nwith the ejaculation, \"You are only a miserable slave!\" he turned\r\naway hurriedly, stepping upon bones, graves, and crosses, like one\r\nbeside himself.\r\n\r\nThe grave-digger patted his arm and muttered, \"All the trouble dead\r\nmen cause! The fat padre caned me for allowing it to be buried while\r\nI was sick, and this fellow almost tore my arm off for having dug it\r\nup. That's what these Spaniards are! I'll lose my job yet!\"\r\n\r\nIbarra walked rapidly with a far-away look in his eyes, while the\r\naged servant followed him weeping. The sun was setting, and over the\r\neastern sky was flung a heavy curtain of clouds. A dry wind shook the\r\ntree-tops and made the bamboo clumps creak. Ibarra went bareheaded,\r\nbut no tear wet his eyes nor did any sigh escape from his breast. He\r\nmoved as if fleeing from something, perhaps the shade of his father,\r\nperhaps the approaching storm. He crossed through the town to the\r\noutskirts on the opposite side and turned toward the old house which he\r\nhad not entered for so many years. Surrounded by a cactus-covered wall\r\nit seemed to beckon to him with its open windows, while the ilang-ilang\r\nwaved its flower-laden branches joyfully and the doves circled about\r\nthe conical roof of their cote in the middle of the garden.\r\n\r\nBut the youth gave no heed to these signs of welcome back to his old\r\nhome, his eyes being fixed on the figure of a priest approaching from\r\nthe opposite direction. It was the curate of San Diego, the pensive\r\nFranciscan whom we have seen before, the rival of the alferez. The\r\nbreeze folded back the brim of his wide hat and blew his _guingón_\r\nhabit closely about him, revealing the outlines of his body and his\r\nthin, curved thighs. In his right hand he carried an ivory-headed\r\n_palasan_ cane.\r\n\r\nThis was the first time that he and Ibarra had met. When they drew\r\nnear each other Ibarra stopped and gazed at him from head to foot;\r\nFray Salvi avoided the look and tried to appear unconcerned. After\r\na moment of hesitation Ibarra went up to him quickly and dropping a\r\nheavy hand on his shoulder, asked in a husky voice, \"What did you do\r\nwith my father?\"\r\n\r\nFray Salvi, pale and trembling as he read the deep feelings that\r\nflushed the youth's face, could not answer; he seemed paralyzed.\r\n\r\n\"What did you do with my father?\" again demanded the youth in a\r\nchoking voice.\r\n\r\nThe priest, who was gradually being forced to his knees by the heavy\r\nhand that pressed upon his shoulder, made a great effort and answered,\r\n\"You are mistaken, I did nothing to your father.\"\r\n\r\n\"You didn't?\" went on the youth, forcing him down upon his knees.\r\n\r\n\"No, I assure you! It was my predecessor, it was Padre Damaso!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed the youth, releasing his hold, and clapping his hand\r\ndesperately to his brow; then, leaving poor Fray Salvi, he turned away\r\nand hurried toward his house. The old servant came up and helped the\r\nfriar to his feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTasio: Lunatic or Sage\r\n\r\n\r\nThe peculiar old man wandered about the streets aimlessly. A former\r\nstudent of philosophy, he had given up his career in obedience to\r\nhis mother's wishes and not from any lack of means or ability. Quite\r\nthe contrary, it was because his mother was rich and he was said\r\nto possess talent. The good woman feared that her son would become\r\nlearned and forget God, so she had given him his choice of entering\r\nthe priesthood or leaving college. Being in love, he chose the latter\r\ncourse and married. Then having lost both his wife and his mother\r\nwithin a year, he sought consolation in his books in order to free\r\nhimself from sorrow, the cockpit, and the dangers of idleness. He\r\nbecame so addicted to his studies and the purchase of books, that he\r\nentirely neglected his fortune and gradually ruined himself. Persons\r\nof culture called him Don Anastasio, or Tasio the Sage, while the\r\ngreat crowd of the ignorant knew him as Tasio the Lunatic, on account\r\nof his peculiar ideas and his eccentric manner of dealing with others.\r\n\r\nAs we said before, the evening threatened to be stormy. The lightning\r\nflashed its pale rays across the leaden sky, the air was heavy and\r\nthe slight breeze excessively sultry. Tasio had apparently already\r\nforgotten his beloved skull, and now he was smiling as he looked at\r\nthe dark clouds. Near the church he met a man wearing an alpaca coat,\r\nwho carried in one hand a large bundle of candles and in the other\r\na tasseled cane, the emblem of his office as gobernadorcillo.\r\n\r\n\"You seem to be merry?\" he greeted Tasio in Tagalog.\r\n\r\n\"Truly I am, señor capitan, I'm merry because I hope for something.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah? What do you hope for?\"\r\n\r\n\"The storm!\"\r\n\r\n\"The storm? Are you thinking of taking a bath?\" asked the\r\ngobernadorcillo in a jesting way as he stared at the simple attire\r\nof the old man.\r\n\r\n\"A bath? That's not a bad idea, especially when one has just stumbled\r\nover some trash!\" answered Tasio in a similar, though somewhat\r\nmore offensive tone, staring at the other's face. \"But I hope for\r\nsomething better.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some thunderbolts that will kill people and burn down houses,\"\r\nreturned the Sage seriously.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you ask for the deluge at once?\"\r\n\r\n\"We all deserve it, even you and I! You, señor gobernadorcillo,\r\nhave there a bundle of tapers that came from some Chinese shop, yet\r\nthis now makes the tenth year that I have been proposing to each new\r\noccupant of your office the purchase of lightning-rods. Every one\r\nlaughs at me, and buys bombs and rockets and pays for the ringing of\r\nbells. Even you yourself, on the day after I made my proposition,\r\nordered from the Chinese founders a bell in honor of St. Barbara,\r\n[53] when science has shown that it is dangerous to ring the bells\r\nduring a storm. Explain to me why in the year '70, when lightning\r\nstruck in Biñan, it hit the very church tower and destroyed the clock\r\nand altar. What was the bell of St. Barbara doing then?\"\r\n\r\nAt the moment there was a vivid flash. \"_Jesús, María, y José!_\r\nHoly St. Barbara!\" exclaimed the gobernadorcillo, turning pale and\r\ncrossing himself.\r\n\r\nTasio burst out into a loud laugh. \"You are worthy of your patroness,\"\r\nhe remarked dryly in Spanish as he turned his back and went toward\r\nthe church.\r\n\r\nInside, the sacristans were preparing a catafalque, bordered with\r\ncandles placed in wooden sockets. Two large tables had been placed\r\none above the other and covered with black cloth across which ran\r\nwhite stripes, with here and there a skull painted on it.\r\n\r\n\"Is that for the souls or for the candles?\" inquired the old man,\r\nbut noticing two boys, one about ten and the other seven, he turned\r\nto them without awaiting an answer from the sacristans.\r\n\r\n\"Won't you come with me, boys?\" he asked them. \"Your mother has\r\nprepared a supper for you fit for a curate.\"\r\n\r\n\"The senior sacristan will not let us leave until eight o'clock,\r\nsir,\" answered the larger of the two boys. \"I expect to get my pay\r\nto give it to our mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! And where are you going now?\"\r\n\r\n\"To the belfry, sir, to ring the knell for the souls.\"\r\n\r\n\"Going to the belfry! Then take care! Don't go near the bells during\r\nthe storm!\"\r\n\r\nTasio then left the church, not without first bestowing a look of pity\r\non the two boys, who were climbing the stairway into the organ-loft. He\r\npassed his hand over his eyes, looked at the sky again, and murmured,\r\n\"Now I should be sorry if thunderbolts should fall.\" With his head\r\nbowed in thought he started toward the outskirts of the town.\r\n\r\n\"Won't you come in?\" invited a voice in Spanish from a window.\r\n\r\nThe Sage raised his head and saw a man of thirty or thirty-five years\r\nof age smiling at him.\r\n\r\n\"What are you reading there?\" asked Tasio, pointing to a book the\r\nman held in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"A work just published: 'The Torments Suffered by the Blessed Souls\r\nin Purgatory,'\" the other answered with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"Man, man, man!\" exclaimed the Sage in an altered tone as he entered\r\nthe house. \"The author must be a very clever person.\"\r\n\r\nUpon reaching the top of the stairway, he was cordially received by the\r\nmaster of the house, Don Filipo Lino, and his young wife, Doña Teodora\r\nViña. Don Filipo was the teniente-mayor of the town and leader of one\r\nof the parties--the liberal faction, if it be possible to speak so,\r\nand if there exist parties in the towns of the Philippines.\r\n\r\n\"Did you meet in the cemetery the son of the deceased Don Rafael,\r\nwho has just returned from Europe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I saw him as he alighted from his carriage.\"\r\n\r\n\"They say that he went to look for his father's grave. It must have\r\nbeen a terrible blow.\"\r\n\r\nThe Sage shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"Doesn't such a misfortune affect you?\" asked the young wife.\r\n\r\n\"You know very well that I was one of the six who accompanied the body,\r\nand it was I who appealed to the Captain-General when I saw that no\r\none, not even the authorities, said anything about such an outrage,\r\nalthough I always prefer to honor a good man in life rather than to\r\nworship him after his death.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"But, madam, I am not a believer in hereditary monarchy. By reason\r\nof the Chinese blood which I have received from my mother I believe\r\na little like the Chinese: I honor the father on account of the son\r\nand not the son on account of the father. I believe that each one\r\nshould receive the reward or punishment for his own deeds, not for\r\nthose of another.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you order a mass said for your dead wife, as I advised\r\nyou yesterday?\" asked the young woman, changing the subject of\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered the old man with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"What a pity!\" she exclaimed with unfeigned regret.\r\n\r\n\"They say that until ten o'clock tomorrow the souls will wander at\r\nliberty, awaiting the prayers of the living, and that during these\r\ndays one mass is equivalent to five on other days of the year, or\r\neven to six, as the curate said this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! Does that mean that we have a period without paying, which we\r\nshould take advantage of?\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Doray,\" interrupted Don Filipo, \"you know that Don Anastasio\r\ndoesn't believe in purgatory.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe in purgatory!\" protested the old man, partly rising\r\nfrom his seat. \"Even when I know something of its history!\"\r\n\r\n\"The history of purgatory!\" exclaimed the couple, full of\r\nsurprise. \"Come, relate it to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't know it and yet you order masses and talk about its\r\ntorments? Well, as it has begun to rain and threatens to continue,\r\nwe shall have time to relieve the monotony,\" replied Tasio, falling\r\ninto a thoughtful mood.\r\n\r\nDon Filipo closed the book which he held in his hand and Doray sat\r\ndown at his side determined not to believe anything that the old man\r\nwas about to say.\r\n\r\nThe latter began in the following manner: \"Purgatory existed long\r\nbefore Our Lord came into the world and must have been located in\r\nthe center of the earth, according to Padre Astete; or somewhere near\r\nCluny, according to the monk of whom Padre Girard tells us. But the\r\nlocation is of least importance here. Now then, who were scorching\r\nin those fires that had been burning from the beginning of the\r\nworld? Its very ancient existence is proved by Christian philosophy,\r\nwhich teaches that God has created nothing new since he rested.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it could have existed _in potentia_ and not _in actu_,\" [54]\r\nobserved Don Filipo.\r\n\r\n\"Very well! But yet I must answer that some knew of it and as existing\r\n_in actu_. One of these was Zarathustra, or Zoroaster, who wrote\r\npart of the Zend-Avesta and founded a religion which in some points\r\nresembles ours, and Zarathustra, according to the scholars, flourished\r\nat least eight hundred years before Christ. I say 'at least,' since\r\nGaffarel, after examining the testimony of Plato, Xanthus of Lydia,\r\nPliny, Hermippus, and Eudoxus, believes it to have been two thousand\r\nfive hundred years before our era. However that may be, it is certain\r\nthat Zarathustra talked of a kind of purgatory and showed ways of\r\ngetting free from it. The living could redeem the souls of those who\r\ndied in sin by reciting passages from the Avesta and by doing good\r\nworks, but under the condition that the person offering the petitions\r\nshould be a relative, up to the fourth generation. The time for this\r\noccurred every year and lasted five days. Later, when this belief had\r\nbecome fixed among the people, the priests of that religion saw in it a\r\nchance of profit and so they exploited 'the deep and dark prison where\r\nremorse reigns,' as Zarathustra called it. They declared that by the\r\npayment of a small coin it was possible to save a soul from a year of\r\ntorture, but as in that religion there were sins punishable by three\r\nhundred to a thousand years of suffering, such as lying, faithlessness,\r\nfailure to keep one's word, and so on, it resulted that the rascals\r\ntook in countless sums. Here you will observe something like our\r\npurgatory, if you take into account the differences in the religions.\"\r\n\r\nA vivid flash of lightning, followed by rolling thunder, caused Doray\r\nto start up and exclaim, as she crossed herself: \"_Jesús, María,\r\ny José!_ I'm going to leave you, I'm going to burn some sacred palm\r\nand light candles of penitence.\"\r\n\r\nThe rain began to fall in torrents. The Sage Tasio, watching the young\r\nwoman leave, continued: \"Now that she is not here, we can consider this\r\nmatter more rationally. Doray, even though a little superstitious,\r\nis a good Catholic, and I don't care to root out the faith from her\r\nheart. A pure and simple faith is as distinct from fanaticism as the\r\nflame from smoke or music from discords: only the fools and the deaf\r\nconfuse them. Between ourselves we can say that the idea of purgatory\r\nis good, holy, and rational. It perpetuates the union of those who\r\nwere and those who are, leading thus to greater purity of life. The\r\nevil is in its abuse.\r\n\r\n\"But let us now see where Catholicism got this idea, which does not\r\nexist in the Old Testament nor in the Gospels. Neither Moses nor Christ\r\nmade the slightest mention of it, and the single passage which is\r\ncited from Maccabees is insufficient. Besides, this book was declared\r\napocryphal by the Council of Laodicea and the holy Catholic Church\r\naccepted it only later. Neither have the pagan religions anything\r\nlike it. The oft-quoted passage in Virgil, _Aliae panduntur inanes_,\r\n[55] which probably gave occasion for St. Gregory the Great to speak\r\nof drowned souls, and to Dante for another narrative in his _Divine\r\nComedy_, cannot have been the origin of this belief. Neither the\r\nBrahmins, the Buddhists, nor the Egyptians, who may have given Rome\r\nher Charon and her Avernus, had anything like this idea. I won't speak\r\nnow of the religions of northern Europe, for they were religions of\r\nwarriors, bards, and hunters, and not of philosophers. While they yet\r\npreserve their beliefs and even their rites under Christian forms,\r\nthey were unable to accompany the hordes in the spoliation of Rome\r\nor to seat themselves on the Capitoline; the religions of the mists\r\nwere dissipated by the southern sun. Now then, the early Christians\r\ndid not believe in a purgatory but died in the blissful confidence\r\nof shortly seeing God face to face. Apparently the first fathers of\r\nthe Church who mentioned it were St. Clement of Alexandria, Origen,\r\nand St. Irenaeus, who were all perhaps influenced by Zarathustra's\r\nreligion, which still flourished and was widely spread throughout\r\nthe East, since at every step we read reproaches against Origen's\r\nOrientalism. St. Irenaeus proved its existence by the fact that\r\nChrist remained 'three days in the depths of the earth,' three days\r\nof purgatory, and deduced from this that every soul must remain there\r\nuntil the resurrection of the body, although the '_Hodie mecum eris in\r\nParadiso_' [56] seems to contradict it. St. Augustine also speaks of\r\npurgatory and, if not affirming its existence, yet he did not believe\r\nit impossible, conjecturing that in another existence there might\r\ncontinue the punishments that we receive in this life for our sins.\"\r\n\r\n\"The devil with St. Augustine!\" ejaculated Don Filipo. \"He wasn't\r\nsatisfied with what we suffer here but wished a continuance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, so it went\" some believed it and others didn't. Although\r\nSt. Gregory finally came to admit it in his _de quibusdam levibus\r\nculpis esse ante judicium purgatorius ignis credendus est_, [57] yet\r\nnothing definite was done until the year 1439, that is, eight centuries\r\nlater, when the Council of Florence declared that there must exist\r\na purifying fire for the souls of those who have died in the love of\r\nGod but without having satisfied divine Justice. Lastly, the Council\r\nof Trent under Pius IV in 1563, in the twenty-fifth session, issued\r\nthe purgatorial decree beginning _Cura catholica ecclesia, Spiritu\r\nSanto edocta_, wherein it deduces that, after the office of the mass,\r\nthe petitions of the living, their prayers, alms, and other pious\r\nworks are the surest means of freeing the souls. Nevertheless, the\r\nProtestants do not believe in it nor do the Greek Fathers, since they\r\nreject any Biblical authority for it and say that our responsibility\r\nends with death, and that the '_Quodcumque ligaberis in terra_,'\r\n[58] does not mean '_usque ad purgatorium,_' [59] but to this the\r\nanswer can be made that since purgatory is located in the center of\r\nthe earth it fell naturally under the control of St. Peter. But I\r\nshould never get through if I had to relate all that has been said\r\non the subject. Any day that you wish to discuss the matter with me,\r\ncome to my house and there we will consult the books and talk freely\r\nand quietly.\r\n\r\n\"Now I must go. I don't understand why Christian piety permits robbery\r\non this night--and you, the authorities, allow it--and I fear for\r\nmy books. If they should steal them to read I wouldn't object, but\r\nI know that there are many who wish to burn them in order to do for\r\nme an act of charity, and such charity, worthy of the Caliph Omar,\r\nis to be dreaded. Some believe that on account of those books I am\r\nalready damned--\"\r\n\r\n\"But I suppose that you do believe in damnation?\" asked Doray with\r\na smile, as she appeared carrying in a brazier the dry palm leaves,\r\nwhich gave off a peculiar smoke and an agreeable odor.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, madam, what God will do with me,\" replied the old man\r\nthoughtfully. \"When I die I will commit myself to Him without fear\r\nand He may do with me what He wishes. But a thought strikes me!\"\r\n\r\n\"What thought is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"If the only ones who can be saved are the Catholics, and of them\r\nonly five per cent--as many curates say--and as the Catholics form\r\nonly a twelfth part of the population of the world--if we believe\r\nwhat statistics show--it would result that after damning millions\r\nand millions of men during the countless ages that passed before\r\nthe Saviour came to the earth, after a Son of God has died for us,\r\nit is now possible to save only five in every twelve hundred. That\r\ncannot be so! I prefer to believe and say with Job: 'Wilt thou break\r\na leaf driven to and fro, and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?' No,\r\nsuch a calamity is impossible and to believe it is blasphemy!\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you wish? Divine Justice, divine Purity--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but divine Justice and divine Purity saw the future before the\r\ncreation,\" answered the old man, as he rose shuddering. \"Man is an\r\naccidental and not a necessary part of creation, and that God cannot\r\nhave created him, no indeed, only to make a few happy and condemn\r\nhundreds to eternal misery, and all in a moment, for hereditary\r\nfaults! No! If that be true, strangle your baby son sleeping there! If\r\nsuch a belief were not a blasphemy against that God, who must be\r\nthe Highest Good, then the Phenician Moloch, which was appeased with\r\nhuman sacrifices and innocent blood, and in whose belly were burned\r\nthe babes torn from their mothers' breasts, that bloody deity, that\r\nhorrible divinity, would be by the side of Him a weak girl, a friend,\r\na mother of humanity!\"\r\n\r\nHorrified, the Lunatic--or the Sage--left the house and ran along the\r\nstreet in spite of the rain and the darkness. A lurid flash, followed\r\nby frightful thunder and filling the air with deadly currents, lighted\r\nthe old man as he stretched his hand toward the sky and cried out:\r\n\"Thou protestest! I know that Thou art not cruel, I know that I must\r\nonly name Thee Good!\"\r\n\r\nThe flashes of lightning became more frequent and the storm increased\r\nin violence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nThe Sacristans\r\n\r\n\r\nThe thunder resounded, roar following close upon roar, each preceded'\r\nby a blinding flash of zigzag lightning, so that it might have been\r\nsaid that God was writing his name in fire and that the eternal\r\narch of heaven was trembling with fear. The rain, whipped about in\r\na different direction each moment by the mournfully whistling wind,\r\nfell in torrents. With a voice full of fear the bells sounded their\r\nsad supplication, and in the brief pauses between the roars of the\r\nunchained elements tolled forth sorrowful peals, like plaintive groans.\r\n\r\nOn the second floor of the church tower were the two boys whom we saw\r\ntalking to the Sage. The younger, a child of seven years with large\r\nblack eyes and a timid countenance, was huddling close to his brother,\r\na boy of ten, whom he greatly resembled in features, except that the\r\nlook on the elder's face was deeper and firmer.\r\n\r\nBoth were meanly dressed in clothes full of rents and patches. They sat\r\nupon a block of wood, each holding the end of a rope which extended\r\nupward and was lost amid the shadows above. The wind-driven rain\r\nreached them and snuffed the piece of candle burning dimly on the\r\nlarge round stone that was used to furnish the thunder on Good Friday\r\nby being rolled around the gallery.\r\n\r\n\"Pull on the rope, Crispin, pull!\" cried the elder to his little\r\nbrother, who did as he was told, so that from above was heard a faint\r\npeal, instantly drowned out by the reechoing thunder.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if we were only at home now with mother,\" sighed the younger,\r\nas he gazed at his brother. \"There I shouldn't be afraid.\"\r\n\r\nThe elder did not answer; he was watching the melting wax of the\r\ncandle, apparently lost in thought.\r\n\r\n\"There no one would say that I stole,\" went on Crispin. \"Mother\r\nwouldn't allow it. If she knew that they whip me--\"\r\n\r\nThe elder took his gaze from the flame, raised his head, and clutching\r\nthe thick rope pulled violently on it so that a sonorous peal of the\r\nbells was heard.\r\n\r\n\"Are we always going to live this way, brother?\" continued\r\nCrispin. \"I'd like to get sick at home tomorrow, I'd like to fall\r\ninto a long sickness so that mother might take care of me and not\r\nlet me come back to the convento. So I'd not be called a thief nor\r\nwould they whip me. And you too, brother, you must get sick with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered the older, \"we should all die: mother of grief and we\r\nof hunger.\"\r\n\r\nCrispin remained silent for a moment, then asked, \"How much will you\r\nget this month?\"\r\n\r\n\"Two pesos. They're fined me twice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then pay what they say I've stolen, so that they won't call us\r\nthieves. Pay it, brother!\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you crazy, Crispin? Mother wouldn't have anything to eat. The\r\nsenior sacristan says that you've stolen two gold pieces, and they're\r\nworth thirty-two pesos.\"\r\n\r\nThe little one counted on his fingers up to thirty-two. \"Six\r\nhands and two fingers over and each finger a peso!\" he murmured\r\nthoughtfully. \"And each peso, how many cuartos?\"\r\n\r\n\"A hundred and sixty.\"\r\n\r\n\"A hundred and sixty cuartos? A hundred and sixty times a\r\ncuarto? Goodness! And how many are a hundred and sixty?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thirty-two hands,\" answered the older.\r\n\r\nCrispin looked hard at his little hands. \"Thirty-two hands,\" he\r\nrepeated, \"six hands and two fingers over and each finger thirty-two\r\nhands and each finger a cuarto--goodness, what a lot of cuartos! I\r\ncould hardly count them in three days; and with them could be bought\r\nshoes for our feet, a hat for my head when the sun shines hot, a\r\nbig umbrella for the rain, and food, and clothes for you and mother,\r\nand--\" He became silent and thoughtful again.\r\n\r\n\"Now I'm sorry that I didn't steal!\" he soon exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Crispin!\" reproached his brother.\r\n\r\n\"Don't get angry! The curate has said that he'll beat me to death\r\nif the money doesn't appear, and if I had stolen it I could make\r\nit appear. Anyhow, if I died you and mother would at least have\r\nclothes. Oh, if I had only stolen it!\"\r\n\r\nThe elder pulled on the rope in silence. After a time he replied with\r\na sigh: \"What I'm afraid of is that mother will scold you when she\r\nknows about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think so?\" asked the younger with astonishment. \"You will\r\ntell her that they're whipped me and I'll show the welts on my back\r\nand my torn pocket. I had only one cuarto, which was given to me last\r\nEaster, but the curate took that away from me yesterday. I never saw\r\na prettier cuarto! No, mother won't believe it.\"\r\n\r\n\"If the curate says so--\"\r\n\r\nCrispin began to cry, murmuring between his sobs, \"Then go home\r\nalone! I don't want to go. Tell mother that I'm sick. I don't want\r\nto go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Crispin, don't cry!\" pleaded the elder. \"Mother won't believe\r\nit--don't cry! Old Tasio told us that a fine supper is waiting for us.\"\r\n\r\n\"A fine supper! And I haven't eaten for a long time. They won't give\r\nme anything to eat until the two gold pieces appear. But, if mother\r\nbelieves it? You must tell her that the senior sacristan is a liar\r\nbut that the curate believes him and that all of them are liars, that\r\nthey say that we're thieves because our father is a vagabond who--\"\r\n\r\nAt that instant a head appeared at the top of the stairway leading\r\ndown to the floor below, and that head, like Medusa's, froze the\r\nwords on the child's lips. It was a long, narrow head covered with\r\nblack hair, with blue glasses concealing the fact that one eye was\r\nsightless. The senior sacristan was accustomed to appear thus without\r\nnoise or warning of any kind. The two brothers turned cold with fear.\r\n\r\n\"On you, Basilio, I impose a fine of two reals for not ringing the\r\nbells in time,\" he said in a voice so hollow that his throat seemed\r\nto lack vocal chords. \"You, Crispin, must stay tonight, until what\r\nyou stole reappears.\"\r\n\r\nCrispin looked at his brother as if pleading for protection.\r\n\r\n\"But we already have permission--mother expects us at eight o'clock,\"\r\nobjected Basilio timidly.\r\n\r\n\"Neither shall you go home at eight, you'll stay until ten.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, sir, after nine o'clock no one is allowed to be out and our\r\nhouse is far from here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you trying to give me orders?\" growled the man irritably, as he\r\ncaught Crispin by the arm and started to drag him away.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, sir, it's been a week now since we're seen our mother,\" begged\r\nBasilio, catching hold of his brother as if to defend him.\r\n\r\nThe senior sacristan struck his hand away and jerked at Crispin,\r\nwho began to weep as he fell to the floor, crying out to his brother,\r\n\"Don't leave me, they're going to kill me!\"\r\n\r\nThe sacristan gave no heed to this and dragged him on to the\r\nstairway. As they disappeared among the shadows below Basilio stood\r\nspeechless, listening to the sounds of his brother's body striking\r\nagainst the steps. Then followed the sound of a blow and heartrending\r\ncries that died away in the distance.\r\n\r\nThe boy stood on tiptoe, hardly breathing and listening fixedly,\r\nwith his eyes unnaturally wide and his fists clenched. \"When shall I\r\nbe strong enough to plow a field?\" he muttered between his teeth as\r\nhe started below hastily. Upon reaching the organ-loft he paused to\r\nlisten; the voice of his brother was fast dying away in the distance\r\nand the cries of \"Mother! Brother!\" were at last completely cut\r\noff by the sound of a closing door. Trembling and perspiring, he\r\npaused for a moment with his fist in his mouth to keep down a cry of\r\nanguish. He let his gaze wander about the dimly lighted church where\r\nan oil-lamp gave a ghostly light, revealing the catafalque in the\r\ncenter. The doors were closed and fastened, and the windows had iron\r\nbars on them. Suddenly he reascended the stairway to the place where\r\nthe candle was burning and then climbed up into the third floor of\r\nthe belfry. After untying the ropes from the bell-clappers he again\r\ndescended. He was pale and his eyes glistened, but not with tears.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the rain was gradually ceasing and the sky was\r\nclearing. Basilio knotted the ropes together, tied one end to a rail\r\nof the balustrade, and without even remembering to put out the light\r\nlet himself down into the darkness outside. A few moments later voices\r\nwere heard on one of the streets of the town, two shots resounded,\r\nbut no one seemed to be alarmed and silence again reigned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nSisa\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough the dark night the villagers slept. The families who had\r\nremembered their dead gave themselves up to quiet and satisfied sleep,\r\nfor they had recited their requiems, the novena of the souls, and had\r\nburned many wax tapers before the sacred images. The rich and powerful\r\nhad discharged the duties their positions imposed upon them. On the\r\nfollowing day they would hear three masses said by each priest and\r\nwould give two pesos for another, besides buying a bull of indulgences\r\nfor the dead. Truly, divine justice is not nearly so exacting as human.\r\n\r\nBut the poor and indigent who earn scarcely enough to keep themselves\r\nalive and who also have to pay tribute to the petty officials, clerks,\r\nand soldiers, that they may be allowed to live in peace, sleep not\r\nso tranquilly as gentle poets who have perhaps not felt the pinches\r\nof want would have us believe. The poor are sad and thoughtful, for\r\non that night, if they have not recited many prayers, yet they have\r\nprayed much--with pain in their eyes and tears in their hearts. They\r\nhave not the novenas, nor do they know the responsories, versicles,\r\nand prayers which the friars have composed for those who lack original\r\nideas and feelings, nor do they understand them. They pray in the\r\nlanguage of their misery: their souls weep for them and for those\r\ndead beings whose love was their wealth. Their lips may proffer\r\nthe salutations, but their minds cry out complaints, charged with\r\nlamentations. Wilt Thou be satisfied, O Thou who blessedst poverty,\r\nand you, O suffering souls, with the simple prayers of the poor,\r\noffered before a rude picture in the light of a dim wick, or do\r\nyou perhaps desire wax tapers before bleeding Christs and Virgins\r\nwith small mouths and crystal eyes, and masses in Latin recited\r\nmechanically by priests? And thou, Religion preached for suffering\r\nhumanity, hast thou forgotten thy mission of consoling the oppressed\r\nin their misery and of humiliating the powerful in their pride? Hast\r\nthou now promises only for the rich, for those who, can pay thee?\r\n\r\nThe poor widow watches among the children who sleep at her side. She\r\nis thinking of the indulgences that she ought to buy for the repose\r\nof the souls of her parents and of her dead husband. \"A peso,\"\r\nshe says, \"a peso is a week of happiness for my children, a week of\r\nlaughter and joy, my savings for a month, a dress for my daughter\r\nwho is becoming a woman.\" \"But it is necessary that you put aside\r\nthese worldly desires,\" says the voice that she heard in the pulpit,\r\n\"it is necessary that you make sacrifices.\" Yes, it is necessary. The\r\nChurch does not gratuitously save the beloved souls for you nor does\r\nit distribute indulgences without payment. You must buy them, so\r\ntonight instead of sleeping you should work. Think of your daughter,\r\nso poorly clothed! Fast, for heaven is dear! Decidedly, it seems\r\nthat the poor enter not into heaven. Such thoughts wander through the\r\nspace enclosed between the rough mats spread out on the bamboo floor\r\nand the ridge of the roof, from which hangs the hammock wherein the\r\nbaby swings. The infant's breathing is easy and peaceful, but from\r\ntime to time he swallows and smacks his lips; his hungry stomach,\r\nwhich is not satisfied with what his older brothers have given him,\r\ndreams of eating.\r\n\r\nThe cicadas chant monotonously, mingling their ceaseless notes with\r\nthe trills of the cricket hidden in the grass, or the chirp of the\r\nlittle lizard which has come out in search of food, while the big\r\ngekko, no longer fearing the water, disturbs the concert with its\r\nill-omened voice as it shows its head from out the hollow of the\r\ndecayed tree-trunk.\r\n\r\nThe dogs howl mournfully in the streets and superstitious folk,\r\nhearing them, are convinced that they see spirits and ghosts. But\r\nneither the dogs nor the other animals see the sorrows of men--yet\r\nhow many of these exist!\r\n\r\nDistant from the town an hour's walk lives the mother of Basilio and\r\nCrispin. The wife of a heartless man, she struggles to live for her\r\nsons, while her husband is a vagrant gamester with whom her interviews\r\nare rare but always painful. He has gradually stripped her of her\r\nfew jewels to pay the cost of his vices, and when the suffering Sisa\r\nno longer had anything that he might take to satisfy his whims, he\r\nhad begun to maltreat her. Weak in character, with more heart than\r\nintellect, she knew only how to love and to weep. Her husband was\r\na god and her sons were his angels, so he, knowing to what point he\r\nwas loved and feared, conducted himself like all false gods: daily\r\nhe became more cruel, more inhuman, more wilful. Once when he had\r\nappeared with his countenance gloomier than ever before, Sisa had\r\nconsulted him about the plan of making a sacristan of Basilio, and\r\nhe had merely continued to stroke his game-cock, saying neither yes\r\nnor no, only asking whether the boy would earn much money. She had\r\nnot dared to insist, but her needy situation and her desire that the\r\nboys should learn to read and write in the town school forced her to\r\ncarry out the plan. Still her husband had said nothing.\r\n\r\nThat night, between ten and eleven o'clock, when the stars were\r\nglittering in a sky now cleared of all signs of the storm of the\r\nearly evening, Sisa sat on a wooden bench watching some fagots that\r\nsmouldered upon the fireplace fashioned of rough pieces of natural\r\nrock. Upon a tripod, or _tunko_, was a small pot of boiling rice\r\nand upon the red coals lay three little dried fishes such as are\r\nsold at three for two cuartos. Her chin rested in the palm of her\r\nhand while she gazed at the weak yellow glow peculiar to the cane,\r\nwhich burns rapidly and leaves embers that quickly grow pale. A sad\r\nsmile lighted up her face as she recalled a funny riddle about the pot\r\nand the fire which Crispin had once propounded to her. The boy said:\r\n\"The black man sat down and the red man looked at him, a moment passed,\r\nand cock-a-doodle-doo rang forth.\"\r\n\r\nSisa was still young, and it was plain that at one time she had been\r\npretty and attractive. Her eyes, which, like her disposition, she\r\nhad given to her sons, were beautiful, with long lashes and a deep\r\nlook. Her nose was regular and her pale lips curved pleasantly. She\r\nwas what the Tagalogs call _kayumanguing-kaligátan_; that is, her\r\ncolor was a clear, pure brown. In spite of her youthfulness, pain\r\nand perhaps even hunger had begun to make hollow her pallid cheeks,\r\nand if her abundant hair, in other times the delight and adornment of\r\nher person, was even yet simply and neatly arranged, though without\r\npins or combs, it was not from coquetry but from habit.\r\n\r\nSisa had been for several days confined to the house sewing upon\r\nsome work which had been ordered for the earliest possible time. In\r\norder to earn the money, she had not attended mass that morning, as\r\nit would have taken two hours at least to go to the town and return:\r\npoverty obliges one to sin! She had finished the work and delivered\r\nit but had received only a promise of payment. All that day she had\r\nbeen anticipating the pleasures of the evening, for she knew that her\r\nsons were coming and she had intended to make them some presents. She\r\nhad bought some small fishes, picked the most beautiful tomatoes in\r\nher little garden, as she knew that Crispin was very fond of them, and\r\nbegged from a neighbor, old Tasio the Sage, who lived half a mile away,\r\nsome slices of dried wild boar's meat and a leg of wild duck, which\r\nBasilio especially liked. Full of hope, she had cooked the whitest\r\nof rice, which she herself had gleaned from the threshing-floors. It\r\nwas indeed a curate's meal for the poor boys.\r\n\r\nBut by an unfortunate chance her husband came and ate the rice,\r\nthe slices of wild boar's meat, the duck leg, five of the little\r\nfishes, and the tomatoes. Sisa said nothing, although she felt as\r\nif she herself were being eaten. His hunger at length appeased,\r\nhe remembered to ask for the boys. Then Sisa smiled happily and\r\nresolved that she would not eat that night, because what remained\r\nwas not enough for three. The father had asked for their sons and\r\nthat for her was better than eating.\r\n\r\nSoon he picked up his game-cock and started away.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you want to see them?\" she asked tremulously. \"Old Tasio told\r\nme that they would be a little late. Crispin now knows how to read\r\nand perhaps Basilio will bring his wages.\"\r\n\r\nThis last reason caused the husband to pause and waver, but his good\r\nangel triumphed. \"In that case keep a peso for me,\" he said as he\r\nwent away.\r\n\r\nSisa wept bitterly, but the thought of her sons soon dried her\r\ntears. She cooked some more rice and prepared the only three fishes\r\nthat were left: each would have one and a half. \"They'll have good\r\nappetites,\" she mused, \"the way is long and hungry stomachs have\r\nno heart.\"\r\n\r\nSo she sat, he ear strained to catch every sound, listening to the\r\nlightest footfalls: strong and clear, Basilio; light and irregular,\r\nCrispin--thus she mused. The _kalao_ called in the woods several times\r\nafter the rain had ceased, but still her sons did not come. She put the\r\nfishes inside the pot to keep them warm and went to the threshold of\r\nthe hut to look toward the road. To keep herself company, she began\r\nto sing in a low voice, a voice usually so sweet and tender that when\r\nher sons listened to her singing the _kundíman_ they wept without\r\nknowing why, but tonight it trembled and the notes were halting. She\r\nstopped singing and gazed earnestly into the darkness, but no one\r\nwas coming from the town--that noise was only the wind shaking the\r\nraindrops from the wide banana leaves.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a black dog appeared before her dragging something along the\r\npath. Sisa was frightened but caught up a stone and threw it at the\r\ndog, which ran away howling mournfully. She was not superstitious,\r\nbut she had heard so much about presentiments and black dogs that\r\nterror seized her. She shut the door hastily and sat down by the\r\nlight. Night favors credulity and the imagination peoples the air\r\nwith specters. She tried to pray, to call upon the Virgin and upon\r\nGod to watch over her sons, especially her little Crispin. Then she\r\nforgot her prayers as her thoughts wandered to think about them, to\r\nrecall the features of each, those features that always wore a smile\r\nfor her both asleep and awake. Suddenly she felt her hair rise on her\r\nhead and her eyes stared wildly; illusion or reality, she saw Crispin\r\nstanding by the fireplace, there where he was wont to sit and prattle\r\nto her, but now he said nothing as he gazed at her with those large,\r\nthoughtful eyes, and smiled.\r\n\r\n\"Mother, open the door! Open, mother!\" cried the voice of Basilio\r\nfrom without.\r\n\r\nSisa shuddered violently and the vision disappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nBasilio\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLa vida es sueño.\r\n\r\n\r\nBasilio was scarcely inside when he staggered and fell into his\r\nmother's arms. An inexplicable chill seized Sisa as she saw him enter\r\nalone. She wanted to speak but could make no sound; she wanted to\r\nembrace her son but lacked the strength; to weep was impossible. At\r\nsight of the blood which covered the boy's forehead she cried in a\r\ntone that seemed to come from a breaking heart, \"My sons!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be afraid, mother,\" Basilio reassured her. \"Crispin stayed at\r\nthe convento.\"\r\n\r\n\"At the convento? He stayed at the convento? Is he alive?\"\r\n\r\nThe boy raised his eyes to her. \"Ah!\" she sighed, passing from the\r\ndepths of sorrow to the heights of joy. She wept and embraced her son,\r\ncovering his bloody forehead with kisses.\r\n\r\n\"Crispin is alive! You left him at the convento! But why are you\r\nwounded, my son? Have you had a fall?\" she inquired, as she examined\r\nhim anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"The senior sacristan took Crispin away and told me that I could not\r\nleave until ten o'clock, but it was already late and so I ran away. In\r\nthe town the soldiers challenged me, I started to run, they fired,\r\nand a bullet grazed my forehead. I was afraid they would arrest me and\r\nbeat me and make me scrub out the barracks, as they did with Pablo,\r\nwho is still sick from it.\"\r\n\r\n\"My God, my God!\" murmured his mother, shuddering. \"Thou hast saved\r\nhim!\" Then while she sought for bandages, water, vinegar, and a\r\nfeather, she went on, \"A finger's breadth more and they would have\r\nkilled you, they would have killed my boy! The civil-guards do not\r\nthink of the mothers.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must say that I fell from a tree so that no one will know they\r\nchased me,\" Basilio cautioned her.\r\n\r\n\"Why did Crispin stay?\" asked Sisa, after dressing her son's wound.\r\n\r\nBasilio hesitated a few moments, then with his arms about her and\r\ntheir tears mingling, he related little by little the story of the\r\ngold pieces, without speaking, however, of the tortures they were\r\ninflicting upon his young brother.\r\n\r\n\"My good Crispin! To accuse my good Crispin! It's because we're poor\r\nand we poor people have to endure everything!\" murmured Sisa, staring\r\nthrough her tears at the light of the lamp, which was now dying out\r\nfrom lack of oil. So they remained silent for a while.\r\n\r\n\"Haven't you had any supper yet? Here are rice and fish.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want anything, only a little water.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered his mother sadly, \"I know that you don't like dried\r\nfish. I had prepared something else, but your father came.\"\r\n\r\n\"Father came?\" asked Basilio, instinctively examining the face and\r\nhands of his mother.\r\n\r\nThe son's questioning gaze pained Sisa's heart, for she understood it\r\nonly too well, so she added hastily: \"He came and asked a lot about\r\nyou and wanted to see you, and he was very hungry. He said that if\r\nyou continued to be so good he would come back to stay with us.\"\r\n\r\nAn exclamation of disgust from Basilio's contracted lips interrupted\r\nher. \"Son!\" she reproached him.\r\n\r\n\"Forgive me, mother,\" he answered seriously. \"But aren't we three\r\nbetter off--you, Crispin, and I? You're crying--I haven't said\r\nanything.\"\r\n\r\nSisa sighed and asked, \"Aren't you going to eat? Then let's go to\r\nsleep, for it's now very late.\" She then closed up the hut and covered\r\nthe few coals with ashes so that the fire would not die out entirely,\r\njust as a man does with his inner feelings; he covers them with the\r\nashes of his life, which he calls indifference, so that they may not\r\nbe deadened by daily contact with his fellows.\r\n\r\nBasilio murmured his prayers and lay down near his mother, who was\r\nupon her knees praying. He felt hot and cold, he tried to close his\r\neyes as he thought of his little brother who that night had expected\r\nto sleep in his mother's lap and who now was probably trembling with\r\nterror and weeping in some dark corner of the convento. His ears were\r\nagain pierced with those cries he had heard in the church tower. But\r\nwearied nature soon began to confuse his ideas and the veil of sleep\r\ndescended upon his eyes.\r\n\r\nHe saw a bedroom where two dim tapers burned. The curate, with\r\na rattan whip in his hand, was listening gloomily to something\r\nthat the senior sacristan was telling him in a strange tongue with\r\nhorrible gestures. Crispin quailed and turned his tearful eyes in\r\nevery direction as if seeking some one or some hiding-place. The\r\ncurate turned toward him and called to him irritably, the rattan\r\nwhistled. The child ran to hide himself behind the sacristan, who\r\ncaught and held him, thus exposing him to the curate's fury. The\r\nunfortunate boy fought, kicked, screamed, threw himself on the floor\r\nand rolled about. He picked himself up, ran, slipped, fell, and parried\r\nthe blows with his hands, which, wounded, he hid quickly, all the time\r\nshrieking with pain. Basilio saw him twist himself, strike the floor\r\nwith his head, he saw and heard the rattan whistle. In desperation\r\nhis little brother rose. Mad with pain he threw himself upon his\r\ntormentor and bit him on the hand. The curate gave a cry and dropped\r\nthe rattan--the sacristan caught up a heavy cane and struck the boy a\r\nblow on the head so that he fell stunned--the curate, seeing him down,\r\ntrampled him with his feet. But the child no longer defended himself\r\nnor did he cry out; he rolled along the floor, a lifeless mass that\r\nleft a damp track. [60]\r\n\r\nSisa's voice brought him back to reality. \"What's the matter? Why\r\nare you crying?\"\r\n\r\n\"I dreamed--O God!\" exclaimed Basilio, sitting up, covered with\r\nperspiration. \"It was a dream! Tell me, mother, that it was only a\r\ndream! Only a dream!\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you dream?\"\r\n\r\nThe boy did not answer, but sat drying his tears and wiping away the\r\nperspiration. The hut was in total darkness.\r\n\r\n\"A dream, a dream!\" repeated Basilio in subdued tones.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me what you dreamed. I can't sleep,\" said his mother when he\r\nlay down again.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he said in a low voice, \"I dreamed that we had gone to\r\nglean the rice-stalks--in a field where there were many flowers--the\r\nwomen had baskets full of rice-stalks the men too had baskets full of\r\nrice-stalks--and the children too--I don't remember any more, mother,\r\nI don't remember the rest.\"\r\n\r\nSisa had no faith in dreams, so she did not insist.\r\n\r\n\"Mother, I've thought of a plan tonight,\" said Basilio after a few\r\nmoments' silence.\r\n\r\n\"What is your plan?\" she asked. Sisa was humble in everything, even\r\nwith her own sons, trusting their judgment more than her own.\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to be a sacristan any longer.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen, mother, to what I've been thinking about. Today there arrived\r\nfrom Spain the son of the dead Don Rafael, and he will be a good\r\nman like his father. Well now, mother, tomorrow you will get Crispin,\r\ncollect my wages, and say that I will not be a sacristan any longer. As\r\nsoon as I get well I'll go to see Don Crisostomo and ask him to hire me\r\nas a herdsman of his cattle and carabaos--I'm now big enough. Crispin\r\ncan study with old Tasio, who does not whip and who is a good man,\r\neven if the curate does not believe so. What have we to fear now from\r\nthe padre? Can he make us any poorer than we are? You may believe it,\r\nmother, the old man is good. I've seen him often in the church when\r\nno one else was about, kneeling and praying, believe it. So, mother,\r\nI'll stop being a sacristan. I earn but little and that little is taken\r\naway from me in fines. Every one complains of the same thing. I'll\r\nbe a herdsman and by performing my tasks carefully I'll make my\r\nemployer like me. Perhaps he'll let us milk a cow so that we can drink\r\nmilk--Crispin likes milk so much. Who can tell! Maybe they'll give us\r\na little calf if they see that I behave well and we'll take care of\r\nit and fatten it like our hen. I'll pick fruits in the woods and sell\r\nthem in the town along with the vegetables from our garden, so we'll\r\nhave money. I'll set snares and traps to catch birds and wild cats,\r\n[61] I'll fish in the river, and when I'm bigger, I'll hunt. I'll be\r\nable also to cut firewood to sell or to present to the owner of the\r\ncows, and so he'll be satisfied with us. When I'm able to plow, I'll\r\nask him to let me have a piece of land to plant in sugar-cane or corn\r\nand you won't have to sew until midnight. We'll have new clothes for\r\nevery fiesta, we'll eat meat and big fish, we'll live free, seeing each\r\nother every day and eating together. Old Tasio says that Crispin has a\r\ngood head and so we'll send him to Manila to study. I'll support him\r\nby working hard. Isn't that fine, mother? Perhaps he'll be a doctor,\r\nwhat do you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"What can I say but yes?\" said Sisa as she embraced her son. She noted,\r\nhowever, that in their future the boy took no account of his father,\r\nand shed silent tears.\r\n\r\nBasilio went on talking of his plans with the confidence of the\r\nyears that see only what they wish for. To everything Sisa said\r\nyes--everything appeared good.\r\n\r\nSleep again began to weigh down upon the tired eyelids of the boy,\r\nand this time Ole-Luk-Oie, of whom Andersen tells us, spread over\r\nhim his beautiful umbrella with its pleasing pictures. Now he saw\r\nhimself with his little brother as they picked guavas, alpay, and\r\nother fruits in the woods; they clambered from branch to branch, light\r\nas butterflies; they penetrated into the caves and saw the shining\r\nrocks; they bathed in the springs where the sand was gold-dust and\r\nthe stones like the jewels in the Virgin's crown. The little fishes\r\nsang and laughed, the plants bent their branches toward them laden\r\nwith golden fruit. Then he saw a bell hanging in a tree with a long\r\nrope for ringing it; to the rope was tied a cow with a bird's nest\r\nbetween her horns and Crispin was inside the bell.\r\n\r\nThus he went on dreaming, while his mother, who was not of his age\r\nand who had not run for an hour, slept not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nSouls in Torment\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was about seven o'clock in the morning when Fray Salvi finished\r\ncelebrating his last mass, having offered up three in the space of\r\nan hour. \"The padre is ill,\" commented the pious women. \"He doesn't\r\nmove about with his usual slowness and elegance of manner.\"\r\n\r\nHe took off his vestments without the least comment, without saying\r\na word or looking at any one. \"Attention!\" whispered the sacristans\r\namong themselves. \"The devil's to pay! It's going to rain fines,\r\nand all on account of those two brothers.\"\r\n\r\nHe left the sacristy to go up into the rectory, in the hallway of\r\nwhich there awaited him some seven or eight women seated upon benches\r\nand a man who was pacing back and forth. Upon seeing him approach,\r\nthe women arose and one of them pressed forward to kiss his hand,\r\nbut the holy man made a sign of impatience that stopped her short.\r\n\r\n\"Can it be that you've lost a real, _kuriput?_\" exclaimed the woman\r\nwith a jesting laugh, offended at such a reception. \"Not to give\r\nhis hand to me, Matron of the Sisterhood, Sister Rufa!\" It was an\r\nunheard-of proceeding.\r\n\r\n\"He didn't go into the confessional this morning,\" added Sister Sipa,\r\na toothless old woman. \"I wanted to confess myself so as to receive\r\ncommunion and get the indulgences.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm sorry for you,\" commented a young woman with a frank\r\nface. \"This week I earned three plenary indulgences and dedicated\r\nthem to the soul of my husband.\"\r\n\r\n\"Badly done, Sister Juana,\" said the offended Rufa. \"One plenary\r\nindulgence was enough to get him out of purgatory. You ought not to\r\nsquander the holy indulgences. Do as I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought, so many more the better,\" answered the simple Sister Juana,\r\nsmiling. \"But tell me what you do.\"\r\n\r\nSister Rufa did not answer at once. First, she asked for a buyo and\r\nchewed at it, gazed at her audience, which was listening attentively,\r\nthen spat to one side and commenced, chewing at the buyo meanwhile: \"I\r\ndon't misspend one holy day! Since I've belonged to the Sisterhood I've\r\nearned four hundred and fifty-seven plenary indulgences, seven hundred\r\nsixty thousand five hundred and ninety-eight years of indulgence. I\r\nset down all that I earn, for I like to have clean accounts. I don't\r\nwant to cheat or be cheated.\"\r\n\r\nHere Sister Rufa paused to give more attention to her chewing. The\r\nwomen gazed at her in admiration, but the man who was pacing back and\r\nforth remarked with some disdain, \"Well, this year I've gained four\r\nplenary indulgences more than you have, Sister Rufa, and a hundred\r\nyears more, and that without praying much either.\"\r\n\r\n\"More than I? More than six hundred and eighty-nine plenary indulgences\r\nor nine hundred ninety-four thousand eight hundred and fifty-six\r\nyears?\" queried Rufa, somewhat disgruntled.\r\n\r\n\"That's it, eight indulgences and a hundred fifteen years more and\r\na few months over,\" answered the man, from whose neck hung soiled\r\nscapularies and rosaries.\r\n\r\n\"That's not strange!\" admitted Rufa, at last admitting defeat. \"You're\r\nan expert, the best in the province.\"\r\n\r\nThe flattered man smiled and continued, \"It isn't so wonderful that I\r\nearn more than you do. Why, I can almost say that even when sleeping\r\nI earn indulgences.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what do you do with them, sir?\" asked four or five voices at\r\nthe same time.\r\n\r\n\"Pish!\" answered the man with a gesture of proud disdain. \"I have\r\nthem to throw away!\"\r\n\r\n\"But in that I can't commend you, sir,\" protested Rufa. \"You'll go\r\nto purgatory for wasting the indulgences. You know very well that\r\nfor every idle word one must suffer forty days in fire, according to\r\nthe curate; for every span of thread uselessly wasted, sixty days;\r\nand for every drop of water spilled, twenty. You'll go to purgatory.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll know how to get out,\" answered Brother Pedro with sublime\r\nconfidence. \"How many souls have I saved from the flames! How many\r\nsaints have I made! Besides, even _in articulo mortis_ I can still\r\nearn, if I wish, at least seven plenary indulgences and shall be able\r\nto save others as I die.\" So saying, he strode proudly away.\r\n\r\nSister Rufa turned to the others: \"Nevertheless, you must do as I do,\r\nfor I don't lose a single day and I keep my accounts well. I don't\r\nwant to cheat or be cheated.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what do you do?\" asked Juana.\r\n\r\n\"You must imitate what I do. For example, suppose I earn a year\r\nof indulgence: I set it down in my account-book and say, 'Most\r\nBlessed Father and Lord St. Dominic, please see if there is anybody\r\nin purgatory who needs exactly a year--neither a day more nor a day\r\nless.' Then I play heads and tails: if it comes heads, no; if tails,\r\nyes. Let's suppose that it comes tails, then I write down _paid_; if it\r\ncomes heads, then I keep the indulgence. In this way I arrange groups\r\nof a hundred years each, of which I keep a careful account. It's a pity\r\nthat we can't do with them as with money--put them out at interest,\r\nfor in that way we should be able to save more souls. Believe me,\r\nand do as I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I do it a better way,\" remarked Sister Sipa.\r\n\r\n\"What? Better?\" demanded the astonished Rufa. \"That can't be! My\r\nsystem can't be improved upon!\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen a moment and you'll be convinced, Sister,\" said old Sipa in\r\na tone of vexation.\r\n\r\n\"How is it? Let's hear!\" exclaimed the others.\r\n\r\nAfter coughing ceremoniously the old woman began with great care:\r\n\"You know very well that by saying the _Bendita sea tu pureza_ and\r\nthe _Señor mío Jesucristo, Padre dulcísimo por el gozo_, ten years\r\nare gained for each letter--\"\r\n\r\n\"Twenty!\" \"No, less!\" \"Five!\" interrupted several voices.\r\n\r\n\"A few years more or less make no difference. Now, when a servant\r\nbreaks a plate, a glass, or a cup, I make him pick up the pieces;\r\nand for every scrap, even the very smallest, he has to recite for\r\nme one of those prayers. The indulgences that I earn in this way\r\nI devote to the souls. Every one in my house, except the cats,\r\nunderstands this system.\"\r\n\r\n\"But those indulgences are earned by the servants and not by you,\r\nSister Sipa,\" objected Rufa.\r\n\r\n\"And my cups and plates, who pays for them? The servants are glad to\r\npay for them in that way and it suits me also. I never resort to blows,\r\nonly sometimes a pinch, or a whack on the head.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to do as you do!\" \"I'll do the same!\" \"And I!\" exclaimed\r\nthe women.\r\n\r\n\"But suppose the plate is only broken into two or three pieces,\r\nthen you earn very few,\" observed the obstinate Rufa.\r\n\r\n\"_Abá!_\" answered old Sipa. \"I make them recite the prayers\r\nanyhow. Then I glue the pieces together again and so lose nothing.\"\r\n\r\nSister Rufa had no more objections left.\r\n\r\n\"Allow me to ask about a doubt of mine,\" said young Juana timidly. \"You\r\nladies understand so well these matters of heaven, purgatory, and\r\nhell, while I confess that I'm ignorant. Often I find in the novenas\r\nand other books this direction: three paternosters, three Ave Marias,\r\nand three Gloria Patris--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now I want to know how they should be recited: whether three\r\npaternosters in succession, three Ave Marias in succession, and\r\nthree Gloria Patris in succession; or a paternoster, an Ave Maria,\r\nand a Gloria Patri together, three times?\"\r\n\r\n\"This way: a paternoster three times--\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, Sister Sipa,\" interrupted Rufa, \"they must be recited in\r\nthe other way. You mustn't mix up males and females. The paternosters\r\nare males, the Ave Marias are females, and the Gloria Patris are\r\nthe children.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eh? Excuse me, Sister Rufa: paternoster, Ave Maria, and Gloria are\r\nlike rice, meat, and sauce--a mouthful for the saints--\"\r\n\r\n\"You're wrong! You'll see, for you who pray that way will never get\r\nwhat you ask for.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you who pray the other way won't get anything from your novenas,\"\r\nreplied old Sipa.\r\n\r\n\"Who won't?\" asked Rufa, rising. \"A short time ago I lost a little\r\npig, I prayed to St. Anthony and found it, and then I sold it for a\r\ngood price. _Abá!_\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes? Then that's why one of your neighbors was saying that you sold\r\na pig of hers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who? The shameless one! Perhaps I'm like you--\"\r\n\r\nHere the expert had to interfere to restore peace, for no one\r\nwas thinking any more about paternosters--the talk was all about\r\npigs. \"Come, come, there mustn't be any quarrel over a pig,\r\nSisters! The Holy Scriptures give us an example to follow. The\r\nheretics and Protestants didn't quarrel with Our Lord for driving\r\ninto the water a herd of swine that belonged to them, and we that\r\nare Christians and besides, Brethren of the Holy Rosary, shall we\r\nhave hard words on account of a little pig! What would our rivals,\r\nthe Tertiary Brethren, say?\"\r\n\r\nAll became silent before such wisdom, at the same time fearing what\r\nthe Tertiary Brethren might say. The expert, well satisfied with\r\nsuch acquiescence, changed his tone and continued: \"Soon the curate\r\nwill send for us. We must tell him which preacher we've chosen of\r\nthe three that he suggested yesterday, whether Padre Damaso, Padre\r\nMartin, or the coadjutor. I don't know whether the Tertiary Brethren\r\nhave yet made any choice, so we must decide.\"\r\n\r\n\"The coadjutor,\" murmured Juana timidly.\r\n\r\n\"Ahem! The coadjutor doesn't know how to preach,\" declared Sipa. \"Padre\r\nMartin is better.\"\r\n\r\n\"Padre Martin!\" exclaimed another disdainfully. \"He hasn't any\r\nvoice. Padre Damaso would be better.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right!\" cried Rufa. \"Padre Damaso surely does know how to\r\npreach! He looks like a comedian!\"\r\n\r\n\"But we don't understand him,\" murmured Juana.\r\n\r\n\"Because he's very deep! And as he preaches well--\"\r\n\r\nThis speech was interrupted by the arrival of Sisa, who was carrying\r\na basket on her head. She saluted the Sisters and went on up the\r\nstairway.\r\n\r\n\"She's going in! Let's go in too!\" they exclaimed. Sisa felt her heart\r\nbeating violently as she ascended the stairs. She did not know just\r\nwhat to say to the padre to placate his wrath or what reasons she\r\ncould advance in defense of her son. That morning at the first flush\r\nof dawn she had gone into her garden to pick the choicest vegetables,\r\nwhich she placed in a basket among banana-leaves and flowers; then she\r\nhad looked along the bank of the river for the _pakó_ which she knew\r\nthe curate liked for salads. Putting on her best clothes and without\r\nawakening her son, she had set out for the town with the basket on her\r\nhead. As she went up the stairway she, tried to make as little noise\r\nas possible and listened attentively in the hope that she might hear\r\na fresh, childish voice, so well known to her. But she heard nothing\r\nnor did she meet any one as she made her way to the kitchen. There\r\nshe looked into all the corners. The servants and sacristans received\r\nher coldly, scarcely acknowledging her greeting.\r\n\r\n\"Where can I put these vegetables?\" she asked, not taking any offense\r\nat their coldness.\r\n\r\n\"There, anywhere!\" growled the cook, hardly looking at her as he\r\nbusied himself in picking the feathers from a capon.\r\n\r\nWith great care Sisa arranged the vegetables and the salad leaves on\r\nthe table, placing the flowers above them. Smiling, she then addressed\r\none of the servants, who seemed to be more approachable than the cook:\r\n\"May I speak with the padre?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's sick,\" was the whispered answer.\r\n\r\n\"And Crispin? Do you know if he is in the sacristy?\" The servant\r\nlooked surprised and wrinkled his eyebrows. \"Crispin? Isn't he at\r\nyour house? Do you mean to deny it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Basilio is at home, but Crispin stayed here,\" answered Sisa, \"and\r\nI want to see him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he stayed, but afterwards he ran away, after stealing a lot of\r\nthings. Early this morning the curate ordered me to go and report it\r\nto the Civil Guard. They must have gone to your house already to hunt\r\nfor the boys.\"\r\n\r\nSisa covered her ears and opened her mouth to speak, but her lips\r\nmoved without giving out any sound.\r\n\r\n\"A pretty pair of sons you have!\" exclaimed the cook. \"It's plain\r\nthat you're a faithful wife, the sons are so like the father. Take\r\ncare that the younger doesn't surpass him.\"\r\n\r\nSisa broke out into bitter weeping and let herself fall upon a bench.\r\n\r\n\"Don't cry here!\" yelled the cook. \"Don't you know that the padre's\r\nsick? Get out in the street and cry!\"\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate mother was almost shoved down the stairway at the\r\nvery time when the Sisters were coming down, complaining and making\r\nconjectures about the curate's illness, so she hid her face in her\r\npañuelo and suppressed the sounds of her grief. Upon reaching the\r\nstreet she looked about uncertainly for a moment and then, as if\r\nhaving reached a decision, walked rapidly away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nA Schoolmaster's Difficulties\r\n\r\n\r\n                El vulgo es necio y pues lo paga, es justo\r\n                Hablarle en necio para darle el gusto. [62]\r\n\r\n                                                       LOPE DE VEGA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mountain-encircled lake slept peacefully with that hypocrisy of\r\nthe elements which gave no hint of how its waters had the night before\r\nresponded to the fury of the storm. As the first reflections of light\r\nawoke on its surface the phosphorescent spirits, there were outlined\r\nin the distance, almost on the horizon, the gray silhouettes of the\r\nlittle bankas of the fishermen who were taking in their nets and\r\nof the larger craft spreading their sails. Two men dressed in deep\r\nmourning stood gazing at the water from a little elevation: one was\r\nIbarra and the other a youth of humble aspect and melancholy features.\r\n\r\n\"This is the place,\" the latter was saying. \"From here your father's\r\nbody was thrown into the water. Here's where the grave-digger brought\r\nLieutenant Guevara and me.\"\r\n\r\nIbarra warmly grasped the hand of the young man, who went on: \"You\r\nhave no occasion to thank me. I owed many favors to your father, and\r\nthe only thing that I could do for him was to accompany his body to\r\nthe grave. I came here without knowing any one, without recommendation,\r\nand having neither name nor fortune, just as at present. My predecessor\r\nhad abandoned the school to engage in the tobacco trade. Your father\r\nprotected me, secured me a house, and furnished whatever was necessary\r\nfor running the school. He used to visit the classes and distribute\r\npictures among the poor but studious children, as well as provide\r\nthem with books and paper. But this, like all good things, lasted\r\nonly a little while.\"\r\n\r\nIbarra took off his hat and seemed to be praying for a time. Then he\r\nturned to his companion: \"Did you say that my father helped the poor\r\nchildren? And now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now they get along as well as possible and write when they can,\"\r\nanswered the youth.\r\n\r\n\"What is the reason?\"\r\n\r\n\"The reason lies in their torn camisas and their downcast eyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"How many pupils have you now?\" asked Ibarra with interest, after\r\na pause.\r\n\r\n\"More than two hundred on the roll but only about twenty-five in\r\nactual attendance.\"\r\n\r\n\"How does that happen?\"\r\n\r\nThe schoolmaster smiled sadly as he answered, \"To tell you the reasons\r\nwould make a long and tiresome story.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't attribute my question to idle curiosity,\" replied Ibarra\r\ngravely, while he stared at the distant horizon. \"I've thought\r\nbetter of it and believe that to carry out my father's ideas will be\r\nmore fitting than to weep for him, and far better than to revenge\r\nhim. Sacred nature has become his grave, and his enemies were the\r\npeople and a priest. The former I pardon on account of their ignorance\r\nand the latter because I wish that Religion, which elevated society,\r\nshould be respected. I wish to be inspired with the spirit of him\r\nwho gave me life and therefore desire to know about the obstacles\r\nencountered here in educational work.\"\r\n\r\n\"The country will bless your memory, sir,\" said the schoolmaster,\r\n\"if you carry out the beautiful plans of your dead father! You wish\r\nto know the obstacles which the progress of education meets? Well\r\nthen, under present circumstances, without substantial aid education\r\nwill never amount to much; in the very first place because, even\r\nwhen we have the pupils, lack of suitable means, and other things\r\nthat attract them more, kill off their interest. It is said that in\r\nGermany a peasant's son studies for eight years in the town school,\r\nbut who here would spend half that time when such poor results are to\r\nbe obtained? They read, write, and memorize selections, and sometimes\r\nwhole books, in Spanish, without understanding a single word. [63]\r\nWhat benefit does our country child get from the school?\"\r\n\r\n\"And why have you, who see the evil, not thought of remedying it?\"\r\n\r\nThe schoolmaster shook his head sadly. \"A poor teacher struggles not\r\nonly against prejudices but also against certain influences. First,\r\nit would be necessary to have a suitable place and not to do as I\r\nmust at present--hold the classes under the convento by the side of\r\nthe padre's carriage. There the children, who like to read aloud,\r\nvery naturally disturb the padre, and he often comes down, nervous,\r\nespecially when he has his attacks, yells at them, and even insults\r\nme at times. You know that no one can either teach or learn under\r\nsuch circumstances, for the child will not respect his teacher when\r\nhe sees him abused without standing up for his rights. In order to\r\nbe heeded and to maintain his authority the teacher needs prestige,\r\nreputation, moral strength, and some freedom of action.\r\n\r\n\"Now let me recount to you even sadder details. I have wished to\r\nintroduce reforms and have been laughed at. In order to remedy the evil\r\nof which I just spoke to you, I tried to teach Spanish to the children\r\nbecause, in addition to the fact that the government so orders, I\r\nthought also that it would be of advantage for everybody. I used the\r\nsimplest method of words and phrases without paying any attention to\r\nlong rules, expecting to teach them grammar when they should understand\r\nthe language. At the end of a few weeks some of the brightest were\r\nalmost able to understand me and could use a few phrases.\"\r\n\r\nThe schoolmaster paused and seemed to hesitate, then, as if making\r\na resolution, he went on: \"I must not be ashamed of the story of\r\nmy wrongs, for any one in my place would have acted the same as I\r\ndid. As I said, it was a good beginning, but a few days afterwards\r\nPadre Damaso, who was the curate then, sent for me by the senior\r\nsacristan. Knowing his disposition and fearing to make him wait,\r\nI went upstairs at once, saluted him, and wished him good-morning\r\nin Spanish. His only greeting had been to put out his hand for me to\r\nkiss, but at this he drew it back and without answering me began to\r\nlaugh loud and mockingly. I was very much embarrassed, as the senior\r\nsacristan was present. At the moment I didn't know just what to say,\r\nfor the curate continued his laughter and I stood staring at him. Then\r\nI began to get impatient and saw that I was about to do something\r\nindiscreet, since to be a good Christian and to preserve one's\r\ndignity are not incompatible. I was going to put a question to him\r\nwhen suddenly, passing from ridicule to insult, he said sarcastically,\r\n'So it's _buenos dins, eh? Buenos dias!_ How nice that you know how\r\nto talk Spanish!' Then again he broke out into laughter.\"\r\n\r\nIbarra was unable to repress a smile.\r\n\r\n\"You smile,\" continued the schoolmaster, following Ibarra's example,\r\n\"but I must confess that at the time I had very little desire to\r\nlaugh. I was still standing--I felt the blood rush to my head and\r\nlightning seemed to flash through my brain. The curate I saw far,\r\nfar away. I advanced to reply to him without knowing just what I was\r\ngoing to say, but the senior sacristan put himself between us. Padre\r\nDamaso arose and said to me in Tagalog: 'Don't try to shine in borrowed\r\nfinery. Be content to talk your own dialect and don't spoil Spanish,\r\nwhich isn't meant for you. Do you know the teacher Ciruela? [64]\r\nWell, Ciruela was a teacher who didn't know how to read, and he had\r\na school.' I wanted to detain him, but he went into his bedroom and\r\nslammed the door.\r\n\r\n\"What was I to do with only my meager salary, to collect which I\r\nhave to get the curate's approval and make a trip to the capital of\r\nthe province, what could I do against him, the foremost religious\r\nand political power in the town, backed up by his Order, feared by\r\nthe government, rich, powerful, sought after and listened to, always\r\nbelieved and heeded by everybody? Although he insulted me, I had to\r\nremain silent, for if I replied he would have had me removed from my\r\nposition, by which I should lose all hope in my chosen profession. Nor\r\nwould the cause of education gain anything, but the opposite, for\r\neverybody would take the curate's side, they would curse me and\r\ncall me presumptuous, proud, vain, a bad Christian, uncultured,\r\nand if not those things, then anti-Spanish and a filibuster. Of a\r\nschoolmaster neither learning nor zeal is expected; resignation,\r\nhumility, and inaction only are asked. May God pardon me if I have\r\ngone against my conscience and my judgement, but I was born in this\r\ncountry, I have to live, I have a mother, so I have abandoned myself\r\nto my fate like a corpse tossed about by the waves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did this difficulty discourage you for all time? Have you lived\r\nso since?\"\r\n\r\n\"Would that it had been a warning to me! If only my troubles had been\r\nlimited to that! It is true that from that time I began to dislike\r\nmy profession and thought of seeking some other occupation, as my\r\npredecessor had done, because any work that is done in disgust and\r\nshame is a kind of martyrdom and because every day the school recalled\r\nthe insult to my mind, causing me hours of great bitterness. But what\r\nwas I to do? I could not undeceive my mother, I had to say to her that\r\nher three years of sacrifice to give me this profession now constituted\r\nmy happiness. It is necessary to make her believe that this profession\r\nis most honorable, the work delightful, the way strewn with flowers,\r\nthat the performance of my duties brings me only friendship, that the\r\npeople respect me and show me every consideration. By doing otherwise,\r\nwithout ceasing to be unhappy myself, I should have caused more\r\nsorrow, which besides being useless would also be a sin. I stayed on,\r\ntherefore, and tried not to feel discouraged. I tried to struggle on.\"\r\n\r\nHere he paused for a while, then resumed: \"From the day on which I\r\nwas so grossly insulted I began to examine myself and I found that I\r\nwas in fact very ignorant. I applied myself day and night to the study\r\nof Spanish and whatever concerned my profession. The old Sage lent me\r\nsome books, and I read and pondered over everything that I could get\r\nhold of. With the new ideas that I have been acquiring in one place\r\nand another my point of view has changed and I have seen many things\r\nunder a different aspect from what they had appeared to me before. I\r\nsaw error where before I had seen only truth, and truth in many\r\nthings where I had formerly seen only error. Corporal punishment, for\r\nexample, which from time immemorial has been the distinctive feature\r\nin the schools and which has heretofore been considered as the only\r\nefficacious means of making pupils learn--so we have been accustomed\r\nto believe--soon appeared to me to be a great hindrance rather than\r\nin any way an aid to the child's progress. I became convinced that\r\nit was impossible to use one's mind properly when blows, or similar\r\npunishment, were in prospect. Fear and terror disturb the most serene,\r\nand a child's imagination, besides being very lively, is also very\r\nimpressionable. As it is on the brain that ideas are impressed,\r\nit is necessary that there be both inner and outer calm, that there\r\nbe serenity of spirit, physical and moral repose, and willingness,\r\nso I thought that before everything else I should cultivate in the\r\nchildren confidence, assurance, and some personal pride. Moreover,\r\nI comprehended that the daily sight of floggings destroyed kindness\r\nin their hearts and deadened all sense of dignity, which is such a\r\npowerful lever in the world. At the same time it caused them to lose\r\ntheir sense of shame, which is a difficult thing to restore. I have\r\nalso observed that when one pupil is flogged, he gets comfort from\r\nthe fact that the others are treated in the same way, and that he\r\nsmiles with satisfaction upon hearing the wails of the others. As for\r\nthe person who does the flogging, while at first he may do it with\r\nrepugnance, he soon becomes hardened to it and even takes delight in\r\nhis gloomy task. The past filled me with horror, so I wanted to save\r\nthe present by modifying the old system. I endeavored to make study\r\na thing of love and joy, I wished to make the primer not a black book\r\nbathed in the tears of childhood but a friend who was going to reveal\r\nwonderful secrets, and of the schoolroom not a place of sorrows but a\r\nscene of intellectual refreshment. So, little by little, I abolished\r\ncorporal punishment, taking the instruments of it entirely away from\r\nthe school and replacing them with emulation and personal pride. If\r\none was careless about his lesson, I charged it to lack of desire\r\nand never to lack of capacity. I made them think that they were more\r\ncapable than they really were, which urged them on to study just as\r\nany confidence leads to notable achievements. At first it seemed that\r\nthe change of method was impracticable; many ceased their studies,\r\nbut I persisted and observed that little by little their minds were\r\nbeing elevated and that more children came, that they came with more\r\nregularity, and that he who was praised in the presence of the others\r\nstudied with double diligence on the next day.\r\n\r\n\"It soon became known throughout the town that I did not whip\r\nthe children. The curate sent for me, and fearing another scene I\r\ngreeted him curtly in Tagalog. On this occasion he was very serious\r\nwith me. He said that I was exposing the children to destruction,\r\nthat I was wasting time, that I was not fulfilling my duties, that\r\nthe father who spared the rod was spoiling the child--according\r\nto the Holy Ghost--that learning enters with blood, and so on. He\r\nquoted to me sayings of barbarous times just as if it were enough\r\nthat a thing had been said by the ancients to make it indisputable;\r\naccording to which we ought to believe that there really existed\r\nthose monsters which in past ages were imaged and sculptured in the\r\npalaces and temples. Finally, he charged me to be more careful and to\r\nreturn to the old system, otherwise he would make unfavorable report\r\nabout me to the alcalde of the province. Nor was this the end of my\r\ntroubles. A few days afterward some of the parents of the children\r\npresented themselves under the convento and I had to call to my aid\r\nall my patience and resignation. They began by reminding me of former\r\ntimes when teachers had character and taught as their grandfathers\r\nhad. 'Those indeed were the times of the wise men,' they declared,\r\n'they whipped, and straightened the bent tree. They were not boys but\r\nold men of experience, gray-haired and severe. Don Catalino, king of\r\nthem all and founder of this very school, used to administer no less\r\nthan twenty-five blows and as a result his pupils became wise men\r\nand priests. Ah, the old people were worth more than we ourselves,\r\nyes, sir, more than we ourselves!' Some did not content themselves\r\nwith such indirect rudeness, but told me plainly that if I continued\r\nmy system their children would learn nothing and that they would be\r\nobliged to take them from the school It was useless to argue with them,\r\nfor as a young man they thought me incapable of sound judgment. What\r\nwould I not have given for some gray hairs! They cited the authority\r\nof the curate, of this one and that one, and even called attention\r\nto themselves, saying that if it had not been for the whippings\r\nthey had received from their teachers they would never have learned\r\nanything. Only a few persons showed any sympathy to sweeten for me\r\nthe bitterness of such a disillusioning.\r\n\r\n\"In view of all this I had to give up my system, which, after so much\r\ntoil, was just beginning to produce results. In desperation I carried\r\nthe whips bank to the school the next day and began the barbarous\r\npractice again. Serenity disappeared and sadness reigned in the faces\r\nof the children, who had just begun to care for me, and who were my\r\nonly kindred and friends. Although I tried to spare the whippings and\r\nto administer them with all the moderation possible, yet the children\r\nfelt the change keenly, they became discouraged and wept bitterly. It\r\ntouched my heart, and even though in my own mind I was vexed with the\r\nstupid parents, still I was unable to take any spite out on those\r\ninnocent victims of their parents' prejudices. Their tears burned\r\nme, my heart seemed bursting from my breast, and that day I left\r\nthe school before closing-time to go home and weep alone. Perhaps\r\nmy sensitiveness may seem strange to you, but if you had been in my\r\nplace you would understand it. Old Don Anastasio said to me, 'So the\r\nparents want floggings? Why not inflict them on themselves?' As a\r\nresult of it all I became sick.\" Ibarra was listening thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\"Scarcely had I recovered when I returned to the school to find the\r\nnumber of my pupils reduced to a fifth. The better ones had run away\r\nupon the return to the old system, and of those who remained--mostly\r\nthose who came to school to escape work at home--not one showed any\r\njoy, not one congratulated me on my recovery. It would have been the\r\nsame to them whether I got well or not, or they might have preferred\r\nthat I continue sick since my substitute, although he whipped them\r\nmore, rarely went to the school. My other pupils, those whose parents\r\nhad obliged them to attend school, had gone to other places. Their\r\nparents blamed me for having spoiled them and heaped reproaches on\r\nme for it. One, however, the son of a country woman who visited me\r\nduring my illness, had not returned on account of having been made\r\na sacristan, and the senior sacristan says that the sacristans must\r\nnot attend school: they would be dismissed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were you resigned in looking after your new pupils?\" asked Ibarra.\r\n\r\n\"What else could I do?\" was the queried reply. \"Nevertheless, during my\r\nillness many things had happened, among them a change of curates, so\r\nI took new hope and made another attempt to the end that the children\r\nshould not lose all their time and should, in so far as possible, get\r\nsome benefit from the floggings, that such things might at least have\r\nsome good result for them. I pondered over the matter, as I wished that\r\neven if they could not love me, by getting something useful from me,\r\nthey might remember me with less bitterness. You know that in nearly\r\nall the schools the books are in Spanish, with the exception of the\r\ncatechism in Tagalog, which varies according to the religious order to\r\nwhich the curate belongs. These books are generally novenas, canticles,\r\nand the Catechism of Padre Astete, [65] from which they learn about\r\nas much piety as they would from the books of heretics. Seeing the\r\nimpossibility of teaching the pupils in Spanish or of translating so\r\nmany books, I tried to substitute short passages from useful works\r\nin Tagalog, such as the Treatise on Manners by Hortensio y Feliza,\r\nsome manuals of Agriculture, and so forth. Sometimes I would myself\r\ntranslate simple works, such as Padre Barranera's History of the\r\nPhilippines, which I then dictated to the children, with at times a\r\nfew observations of my own, so that they might make note-books. As\r\nI had no maps for teaching geography, I copied one of the province\r\nthat I saw at the capital and with this and the tiles of the floor\r\nI gave them some idea of the country. This time it was the women\r\nwho got excited. The men contented themselves with smiling, as they\r\nsaw in it only one of my vagaries. The new curate sent for me, and\r\nwhile he did not reprimand me, yet he said that I should first take\r\ncare of religion, that before learning such things the children must\r\npass an examination to show that they had memorized the mysteries,\r\nthe canticles, and the catechism of Christian Doctrine.\r\n\r\n\"So then, I am now working to the end that the children become changed\r\ninto parrots and know by heart so many things of which they do not\r\nunderstand a single word. Many of them now know the mysteries and\r\nthe canticles, but I fear that my efforts will come to grief with\r\nthe Catechism of Padre Astete, since the greater part of the pupils\r\ndo not distinguish between the questions and the answers, nor do they\r\nunderstand what either may mean. Thus we shall die, thus those unborn\r\nwill do, while in Europe they will talk of progress.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's not be so pessimistic,\" said Ibarra. \"The teniente-mayor has\r\nsent me an invitation to attend a meeting in the town hall. Who knows\r\nbut that there you may find an answer to your questions?\"\r\n\r\nThe schoolmaster shook his head in doubt as he answered: \"You'll see\r\nhow the plan of which they talked to me meets the same fate as mine\r\nhas. But yet, let us see!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nThe Meeting in the Town Hall\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hall was about twelve to fifteen meters long by eight to ten\r\nwide. Its whitewashed walls were covered with drawings in charcoal,\r\nmore or less ugly and obscene, with inscriptions to complete their\r\nmeanings. Stacked neatly against the wall in one corner were to be\r\nseen about a dozen old flint-locks among rusty swords and talibons, the\r\narmament of the cuadrilleros. [66] At one end of the hall there hung,\r\nhalf hidden by soiled red curtains, a picture of his Majesty, the King\r\nof Spain. Underneath this picture, upon a wooden platform, an old chair\r\nspread out its broken arms. In front of the chair was a wooden table\r\nspotted with ink stains and whittled and carved with inscriptions\r\nand initials like the tables in the German taverns frequented by\r\nstudents. Benches and broken chairs completed the furniture.\r\n\r\nThis is the hall of council, of judgment, and of torture, wherein are\r\nnow gathered the officials of the town and its dependent villages. The\r\nfaction of old men does not mix with that of the youths, for they are\r\nmutually hostile. They represent respectively the conservative and\r\nthe liberal parties, save that their disputes assume in the towns an\r\nextreme character.\r\n\r\n\"The conduct of the gobernadorcillo fills me with distrust,\"\r\nDon Filipo, the teniente-mayor and leader of the liberal faction,\r\nwas saying to his friends. \"It was a deep-laid scheme, this thing\r\nof putting off the discussion of expenses until the eleventh\r\nhour. Remember that we have scarcely eleven days left.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he has staved at the convento to hold a conference with the\r\ncurate, who is sick,\" observed one of the youths.\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't matter,\" remarked another. \"We have everything\r\nprepared. Just so the plan of the old men doesn't receive a majority--\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe it will,\" interrupted Don Filipo, \"as I shall present\r\nthe plan of the old men myself!\"\r\n\r\n\"What! What are you saying?\" asked his surprised hearers.\r\n\r\n\"I said that if I speak first I shall present the plan of our rivals.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what about our plan?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall leave it to you to present ours,\" answered Don Filipo\r\nwith a smile, turning toward a youthful cabeza de barangay. [67]\r\n\"You will propose it after I have been defeated.\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't understand you, sir,\" said his hearers, staring at him with\r\ndoubtful looks.\r\n\r\n\"Listen,\" continued the liberal leader in a low voice to several\r\nnear him. \"This morning I met old Tasio and the old man said to me:\r\n'Your rivals hate you more than they do your ideas. Do you wish that\r\na thing shall not be done? Then propose it yourself, and though it\r\nwere more useful than a miter, it would be rejected. Once they have\r\ndefeated you, have the least forward person in the whole gathering\r\npropose what you want, and your rivals, in order to humiliate you,\r\nwill accept it.' But keep quiet about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--\"\r\n\r\n\"So I will propose the plan of our rivals and exaggerate it to the\r\npoint of making it ridiculous. Ah, here come Señor Ibarra and the\r\nschoolmaster.\"\r\n\r\nThese two young men saluted each of the groups without joining\r\neither. A few moments later the gobernadorcillo, the very same\r\nindividual whom we saw yesterday carrying a bundle of candles, entered\r\nwith a look of disgust on his face. Upon his entrance the murmurs\r\nceased, every one sat down, and silence was gradually established,\r\nas he took his seat under the picture of the King, coughed four or\r\nfive times, rubbed his hand over his face and head, rested his elbows\r\non the table, then withdrew them, coughed once more, and then the\r\nwhole thing over again.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" he at last began in an unsteady voice, \"I have been so\r\nbold as to call you together here for this meeting--ahem! Ahem! We\r\nhave to celebrate the fiesta of our patron saint, San Diego, on the\r\ntwelfth of this month--ahem!--today is the second--ahem! Ahem!\" At\r\nthis point a slow, dry cough cut off his speech.\r\n\r\nA man of proud bearing, apparently about forty years of age, then\r\narose from the bench of the elders. He was the rich Capitan Basilio,\r\nthe direct contrast of Don Rafael, Ibarra's father. He was a man who\r\nmaintained that after the death of St. Thomas Aquinas the world had\r\nmade no more progress, and that since St. John Lateran had left it,\r\nhumanity had been retrograding.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, allow me to speak a few words about such an interesting\r\nmatter,\" he began. \"I speak first even though there are others here\r\npresent who have more right to do so than I have, but I speak first\r\nbecause in these matters it seems to me that by speaking first one\r\ndoes not take the first place--no more than that by speaking last does\r\none become the least. Besides, the things that I have to say are of\r\nsuch importance that they should not be put off or last spoken of, and\r\naccordingly I wish to speak first in order to give them due weight. So\r\nyou will allow me to speak first in this meeting where I see so many\r\nnotable persons, such as the present señor capitan, the former capitan;\r\nmy distinguished friend, Don Valentin, a former capitan; the friend\r\nof my infancy, Don Julio; our celebrated captain of cuadrilleros,\r\nDon Melchor; and many other personages, whom, for the sake of brevity,\r\nI must omit to enumerate--all of whom you see present here. I beg of\r\nyou that I may be allowed a few words before any one else speaks. Have\r\nI the good fortune to see my humble request granted by the meeting?\"\r\n\r\nHere the orator with a faint smile inclined his head respectfully. \"Go\r\non, you have our undivided attention!\" said the notables alluded to and\r\nsome others who considered Capitan Basilio a great orator. The elders\r\ncoughed in a satisfied way and rubbed their hands. After wiping the\r\nperspiration from his brow with a silk handkerchief, he then proceeded:\r\n\r\n\"Now that you have been so kind and complaisant with my humble self as\r\nto grant me the use of a few words before any one else of those here\r\npresent, I shall take advantage of this permission, so generously\r\ngranted, and shall talk. In imagination I fancy myself in the midst\r\nof the august Roman senate, _senatus populusque romanus_, as was said\r\nin those happy days which, unfortunately for humanity, will nevermore\r\nreturn. I propose to the _Patres Conscripti_, as the learned Cicero\r\nwould say if he were in my place, I propose, in view of the short time\r\nleft, and time is money as Solomon said, that concerning this important\r\nmatter each one set forth his opinion clearly, briefly, and simply.\"\r\n\r\nSatisfied with himself and flattered by the attention in the hall, the\r\norator took his seat, not without first casting a glance of superiority\r\ntoward Ibarra, who was seated in a corner, and a significant look at\r\nhis friends as if to say, \"Aha! Haven't I spoken well?\" His friends\r\nreflected both of these expressions by staring at the youths as though\r\nto make them die of envy.\r\n\r\n\"Now any one may speak who wishes that--ahem!\" began the\r\ngobernadorcillo, but a repetition of the cough and sighs cut short\r\nthe phrase.\r\n\r\nTo judge from the silence, no one wished to consider himself called\r\nupon as one of the Conscript Fathers, since no one rose. Then Don\r\nFilipo seized the opportunity and rose to speak. The conservatives\r\nwinked and made significant signs to each other.\r\n\r\n\"I rise, gentlemen, to present my estimate of expenses for the fiesta,\"\r\nhe began. \"We can't allow it,\" commented a consumptive old man,\r\nwho was an irreconcilable conservative.\r\n\r\n\"We'll vote against it,\" corroborated others. \"Gentlemen!\" exclaimed\r\nDon Filipo, repressing a smile, \"I haven't yet made known the plan\r\nwhich we, _the younger men_, bring here. We feel _sure_ that this\r\ngreat plan will be preferred by all over any other that our opponents\r\nthink of or are capable of conceiving.\"\r\n\r\nThis presumptuous exordium so thoroughly irritated the minds of the\r\nconservatives that they swore in their hearts to offer determined\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\n\"We have estimated three thousand five hundred pesos for the expenses,\"\r\nwent on Don Filipo. \"Now then, with such a sum we shall be able to\r\ncelebrate a fiesta that will eclipse in magnificence any that has\r\nbeen seen up to this time in our own or neighboring provinces.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ahem!\" coughed some doubters. \"The town of A---- has five thousand,\r\nB---- has four thousand, ahem! Humbug!\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen to me, gentlemen, and I'll convince you,\" continued the\r\nunterrified speaker. \"I propose that we erect a theater in the middle\r\nof the plaza, to cost one hundred and fifty pesos.\"\r\n\r\n\"That won't be enough! It'll take one hundred and sixty,\" objected\r\na confirmed conservative.\r\n\r\n\"Write it down, Señor Director, two hundred pesos for the theater,\"\r\nsaid Don Filipo. \"I further propose that we contract with a troupe\r\nof comedians from Tondo for seven performances on seven successive\r\nnights. Seven performances at two hundred pesos a night make fourteen\r\nhundred pesos. Write down fourteen hundred pesos, Señor Director!\"\r\n\r\nBoth the elders and the youths stared in amazement. Only those in\r\nthe secret gave no sign.\r\n\r\n\"I propose besides that we have magnificent fireworks; no little\r\nlights and pin-wheels such as please children and old maids, nothing\r\nof the sort. We want big bombs and immense rockets. I propose two\r\nhundred big bombs at two pesos each and two hundred rockets at the\r\nsame price. We'll have them made by the pyrotechnists of Malabon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Huh!\" grunted an old man, \"a two-peso bomb doesn't frighten or deafen\r\nme! They ought to be three-peso ones.\"\r\n\r\n\"Write down one thousand pesos for two hundred bombs and two hundred\r\nrockets.\"\r\n\r\nThe conservatives could no longer restrain themselves. Some of them\r\nrose and began to whisper together. \"Moreover, in order that our\r\nvisitors may see that we are a liberal people and have plenty of\r\nmoney,\" continued the speaker, raising his voice and casting a rapid\r\nglance at the whispering group of elders, \"I propose: first, four\r\n_hermanos mayores_ [68] for the two days of the fiesta; and second,\r\nthat each day there be thrown into the lake two hundred fried chickens,\r\none hundred stuffed capons, and forty roast pigs, as did Sylla,\r\na contemporary of that Cicero, of whom Capitan Basilio just spoke.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's it, like Sylla,\" repeated the flattered Capitan Basilio.\r\n\r\nThe surprise steadily increased.\r\n\r\n\"Since many rich people will attend and each one will bring thousands\r\nof pesos, his best game-cocks, and his playing-cards, I propose that\r\nthe cockpit run for fifteen days and that license be granted to open\r\nall gambling houses--\"\r\n\r\nThe youths interrupted him by rising, thinking that he had gone\r\ncrazy. The elders were arguing heatedly.\r\n\r\n\"And, finally, that we may not neglect the pleasures of the soul--\"\r\n\r\nThe murmurs and cries which arose all over the hall drowned his voice\r\nout completely, and tumult reigned.\r\n\r\n\"No!\" yelled an irreconcilable conservative. \"I don't want him to\r\nflatter himself over having run the whole fiesta, no! Let me speak! Let\r\nme speak!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don Filipo has deceived us,\" cried the liberals. \"We'll vote against\r\nhis plan. He has gone over to the old men. We'll vote against him!\"\r\n\r\nThe gobernadorcillo, more overwhelmed than ever, did nothing to restore\r\norder, but rather was waiting for them to restore it themselves.\r\n\r\nThe captain of the cuadrilleros begged to be heard and was granted\r\npermission to speak, but he did not open his mouth and sat down again\r\nconfused and ashamed.\r\n\r\nBy good fortune, Capitan Valentin, the most moderate of all\r\nthe conservatives, arose and said: \"We cannot agree to what the\r\nteniente-mayor has proposed, as it appears to be exaggerated. So many\r\nbombs and so many nights of theatrical performances can only be desired\r\nby a young man, such as he is, who can spend night after night sitting\r\nup and listening to so many explosions without becoming deaf. I have\r\nconsulted the opinion of the sensible persons here and all of them\r\nunanimously disapprove Don Filipo's plan. Is it not so, gentlemen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes!\" cried the youths and elders with one voice. The youths\r\nwere delighted to hear an old man speak so.\r\n\r\n\"What are we going to do with four _hermanos mayores?_\" went on the old\r\nman. \"What is the meaning of those chickens, capons, and roast pigs,\r\nthrown into the lake? 'Humbug!' our neighbors would say. And afterwards\r\nwe should have to fast for six months! What have we to do with Sylla\r\nand the Romans? Have they ever invited us to any of their festivities,\r\nI wonder? I, at least, have never received any invitation from them,\r\nand you can all see that I'm an old man!\"\r\n\r\n\"The Romans live in Rome, where the Pope is,\" Capitan Basilio prompted\r\nhim in a low voice. \"Now I understand!\" exclaimed the old man calmly.\r\n\r\n\"They would make of their festivals watch-meetings, and the Pope\r\nwould order them to throw their food into the sea so that they might\r\ncommit no sin. But, in spite of all that, your plan is inadmissible,\r\nimpossible, a piece of foolishness!\"\r\n\r\nBeing so stoutly opposed, Don Filipo had to withdraw his proposal. Now\r\nthat their chief rival had been defeated, even the worst of the\r\nirreconcilable insurgents looked on with calmness while a young cabeza\r\nde barangay asked for the floor.\r\n\r\n\"I beg that you excuse the boldness of one so young as I am in\r\ndaring to speak before so many persons respected for their age and\r\nprudence and judgment in affairs, but since the eloquent orator,\r\nCapitan Basilio, has requested every one to express his opinion,\r\nlet the authoritative words spoken by him excuse my insignificance.\"\r\n\r\nThe conservatives nodded their heads with satisfaction, remarking\r\nto one another: \"This young man talks sensibly.\" \"He's modest.\" \"He\r\nreasons admirably.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a pity that he doesn't know very well how to gesticulate,\"\r\nobserved Capitan Basilio. \"But there's time yet! He hasn't studied\r\nCicero and he's still a young man!\"\r\n\r\n\"If I present to you, gentlemen, any program or plan,\" the young\r\nman continued, \"I don't do so with the thought that you will find\r\nit perfect or that you will accept it, but at the same time that I\r\nonce more bow to the judgment of all of you, I wish to prove to our\r\nelders that our thoughts are always like theirs, since we take as\r\nour own those ideas so eloquently expressed by Capitan Basilio.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well spoken! Well spoken!\" cried the flattered conservatives. Capitan\r\nBasilio made signs to the speaker showing him how he should stand and\r\nhow he ought to move his arm. The only one remaining impassive was the\r\ngobernadorcillo, who was either bewildered or preoccupied; as a matter\r\nof fact, he seemed to be both. The young man went on with more warmth:\r\n\r\n\"My plan, gentlemen, reduces itself to this: invent new shows that\r\nare not common and ordinary, such as we see every day, and endeavor\r\nthat the money collected may not leave the town, and that it be not\r\nwasted in smoke, but that it be used in some manner beneficial to all.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right!\" assented the youths. \"That's what we want.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excellent!\" added the elders.\r\n\r\n\"What should we get from a week of comedies, as the teniente-mayor\r\nproposes? What can we learn from the kings of Bohemia and Granada, who\r\ncommanded that their daughters' heads be cut off, or that they should\r\nbe blown from a cannon, which later is converted into a throne? We\r\nare not kings, neither are we barbarians; we have no cannon, and if\r\nwe should imitate those people, they would hang us on Bagumbayan. What\r\nare those princesses who mingle in the battles, scattering thrusts and\r\nblows about in combat with princes, or who wander alone over mountains\r\nand through valleys as though seduced by the _tikbálang_? Our nature is\r\nto love sweetness and tenderness in woman, and we would shudder at the\r\nthought of taking the blood-stained hand of a maiden, even when the\r\nblood was that of a Moro or a giant, so abhorred by us. We consider\r\nvile the man who raises his hand against a woman, be he prince or\r\nalferez or rude countryman. Would it not be a thousand times better\r\nto give a representation of our own customs in order to correct our\r\ndefects and vices and to encourage our better qualities?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right! That's right!\" exclaimed some of his faction.\r\n\r\n\"He's right,\" muttered several old men thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\"I should never have thought of that,\" murmured Capitan Basilio.\r\n\r\n\"But how are you going to do it?\" asked the irreconcilable.\r\n\r\n\"Very easily,\" answered the youth. \"I have brought here two\r\ndramas which I feel sure the good taste and recognized judgment of\r\nthe respected elders here assembled will find very agreeable and\r\nentertaining. One is entitled 'The Election of the Gobernadorcillo,'\r\nbeing a comedy in prose in five acts, written by one who is here\r\npresent. The other is in nine acts for two nights and is a fantastical\r\ndrama of a satirical nature, entitled 'Mariang Makiling,' [69] written\r\nby one of the best poets of the province. Seeing that the discussion of\r\npreparations for the fiesta has been postponed and fearing that there\r\nwould not be time enough left, we have secretly secured the actors\r\nand had them learn their parts. We hope that with a week of rehearsal\r\nthey will have plenty of time to know their parts thoroughly. This,\r\ngentlemen, besides being new, useful, and reasonable, has the great\r\nadvantage of being economical; we shall not need costumes, as those\r\nof our daily life will be suitable.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll pay for the theater!\" shouted Capitan Basilio enthusiastically.\r\n\r\n\"If you need cuadrilleros, I'll lend you mine,\" cried their captain.\r\n\r\n\"And I--and I--if art old man is needed--\" stammered another one,\r\nswelling with pride.\r\n\r\n\"Accepted! Accepted!\" cried many voices.\r\n\r\nDon Filipo became pale with emotion and his eyes filled with tears.\r\n\r\n\"He's crying from spite,\" thought the irreconcilable, so he yelled,\r\n\"Accepted! Accepted without discussion!\" Thus satisfied with revenge\r\nand the complete defeat of his rival, this fellow began to praise\r\nthe young man's plan.\r\n\r\nThe latter continued his speech: \"A fifth of the money collected may be\r\nused to distribute a few prizes, such as to the best school child, the\r\nbest herdsman, farmer, fisherman, and so on. We can arrange for boat\r\nraces on the river and lake and for horse races on shore, we can raise\r\ngreased poles and also have other games in which our country people can\r\ntake part. I concede that on account of our long-established customs we\r\nmust have some fireworks; wheels and fire castles are very beautiful\r\nand entertaining, but I don't believe it necessary to have bombs, as\r\nthe former speaker proposed. Two bands of music will afford sufficient\r\nmerriment and thus we shall avoid those rivalries and quarrels between\r\nthe poor musicians who come to gladden our fiesta with their work\r\nand who so often behave like fighting-cocks, afterwards going away\r\npoorly paid, underfed, and even bruised and wounded at times. With\r\nthe money left over we can begin the erection of a small building for\r\na schoolhouse, since we can't wait until God Himself comes down and\r\nbuilds one for us, and it is a sad state of affairs that while we have\r\na fine cockpit our children study almost in the curate's stable. Such\r\nare the outlines of my plan; the details can be worked out by all.\"\r\n\r\nA murmur of pleasure ran through the hall, as nearly every one agreed\r\nwith the youth.\r\n\r\nSome few muttered, \"Innovations! Innovations! When we were young--\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's adopt it for the time being and humiliate that fellow,\" said\r\nothers, indicating Don Filipo.\r\n\r\nWhen silence was restored all were agreed. There was lacking only the\r\napproval of the gobernadorcillo. That worthy official was perspiring\r\nand fidgeting about. He rubbed his hand over his forehead and was at\r\nlength able to stammer out in a weak voice: \"I also agree, but--ahem!\"\r\n\r\nEvery one in the hall listened in silence.\r\n\r\n\"But what?\" asked Capitan Basilio.\r\n\r\n\"Very agreeable,\" repeated the gobernadorcillo, \"that is to say--I\r\ndon't agree--I mean--yes, but--\" Here he rubbed his eyes with the\r\nback of his hand. \"But the curate,\" the poor fellow went on, \"the\r\ncurate wants something else.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does the curate or do we ourselves pay for this fiesta? Has he given\r\na cuarto for it?\" exclaimed a penetrating voice. All looked toward\r\nthe place whence these questions came and saw there the Sage Tasio.\r\n\r\nDon Filipo remained motionless with his eyes fixed on the\r\ngobernadorcillo.\r\n\r\n\"What does the curate want?\" asked Capitan Basilio.\r\n\r\n\"Well, the padre wants six processions, three sermons, three high\r\nmasses, and if there is any money left, a comedy from Tondo with\r\nsongs in the intermissions.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we don't want that,\" said the youths and some of the old men.\r\n\r\n\"The curate wants it,\" repeated the gobernadorcillo. \"I've promised\r\nhim that his wish shall be carried out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why did you have us assemble here?\"\r\n\r\n\"F-for the very purpose of telling you this!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you tell us so at the start?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wanted to tell you, gentlemen, but Capitan Basilio spoke and I\r\nhaven't had a chance. The curate must be obeyed.\"\r\n\r\n\"He must be obeyed,\" echoed several old men.\r\n\r\n\"He must be obeyed or else the alcalde will put us all in jail,\"\r\nadded several other old men sadly.\r\n\r\n\"Well then, obey him, and run the fiesta yourselves,\" exclaimed the\r\nyouths, rising. \"We withdraw our contributions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Everything has already been collected,\" said the gobernadorcillo.\r\n\r\nDon Filipo approached this official and said to him bitterly, \"I\r\nsacrificed my pride in favor of a good cause; you are sacrificing your\r\ndignity as a man in favor of a bad one, and you've spoiled everything.\"\r\n\r\nIbarra turned to the schoolmaster and asked him, \"Is there anything\r\nthat I can do for you at the capital of the province? I leave for\r\nthere immediately.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you some business there?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have business there!\" answered Ibarra mysteriously.\r\n\r\nOn the way home, when Don Filipo was cursing his bad luck, old Tasio\r\nsaid to him: \"The blame is ours! You didn't protest when they gave\r\nyou a slave for a chief, and I, fool that I am, had forgotten it!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nThe Story of a Mother\r\n\r\n\r\n                Andaba incierto--volaba errante,\r\n                Un solo instante--sin descansar. [70]\r\n\r\n                                                    ALAEJOS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSisa ran in the direction of her home with her thoughts in that\r\nconfused whirl which is produced in our being when, in the midst of\r\nmisfortunes, protection and hope alike are gone. It is then that\r\neverything seems to grow dark around us, and, if we do see some\r\nfaint light shining from afar, we run toward it, we follow it,\r\neven though an abyss yawns in our path. The mother wanted to save\r\nher sons, and mothers do not ask about means when their children\r\nare concerned. Precipitately she ran, pursued by fear and dark\r\nforebodings. Had they already arrested her son Basilio? Whither had\r\nher boy Crispin fled?\r\n\r\nAs she approached her little hut she made out above the garden fence\r\nthe caps of two soldiers. It would be impossible to tell what her heart\r\nfelt: she forgot everything. She was not ignorant of the boldness of\r\nthose men, who did not lower their gaze before even the richest people\r\nof the town. What would they do now to her and to her sons, accused\r\nof theft! The civil-guards are not men, they are civil-guards; they\r\ndo not listen to supplications and they are accustomed to see tears.\r\n\r\nSisa instinctively raised her eyes toward the sky, that sky which\r\nsmiled with brilliance indescribable, and in whose transparent\r\nblue floated some little fleecy clouds. She stopped to control the\r\ntrembling that had seized her whole body. The soldiers were leaving\r\nthe house and were alone, as they had arrested nothing more than the\r\nhen which Sisa had been fattening. She breathed more freely and took\r\nheart again. \"How good they are and what kind hearts they have!\" she\r\nmurmured, almost weeping with joy. Had the soldiers burned her house\r\nbut left her sons at liberty she would have heaped blessings upon\r\nthem! She again looked gratefully toward the sky through which a\r\nflock of herons, those light clouds in the skies of the Philippines,\r\nwere cutting their path, and with restored confidence she continued on\r\nher way. As she approached those fearful men she threw her glances in\r\nevery direction as if unconcerned and pretended not to see her hen,\r\nwhich was cackling for help. Scarcely had she passed them when she\r\nwanted to run, but prudence restrained her steps.\r\n\r\nShe had not gone far when she heard herself called by an imperious\r\nvoice. Shuddering, she pretended not to hear, and continued on her\r\nway. They called her again, this time with a yell and an insulting\r\nepithet. She turned toward them, pale and trembling in spite of\r\nherself. One of them beckoned to her. Mechanically Sisa approached\r\nthem, her tongue paralyzed with fear and her throat parched.\r\n\r\n\"Tell us the truth or we'll tie you to that tree and shoot you,\"\r\nsaid one of them in a threatening tone.\r\n\r\nThe woman stared at the tree.\r\n\r\n\"You're the mother of the thieves, aren't you?\" asked the other.\r\n\r\n\"Mother of the thieves!\" repeated Sisa mechanically.\r\n\r\n\"Where's the money your sons brought you last night?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! The money--\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't deny it or it'll be the worse for you,\" added the other. \"We've\r\ncome to arrest your sons, and the older has escaped from us. Where\r\nhave you hidden the younger?\"\r\n\r\nUpon hearing this Sisa breathed more freely and answered, \"Sir, it\r\nhas been many days since I've seen Crispin. I expected to see him\r\nthis morning at the convento, but there they only told me--\"\r\n\r\nThe two soldiers exchanged significant glances. \"All right!\" exclaimed\r\none of them. \"Give us the money and we'll leave you alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" begged the unfortunate woman, \"my sons wouldn't steal\r\neven though they were starving, for we are used to that kind of\r\nsuffering. Basilio didn't bring me a single cuarto. Search the whole\r\nhouse and if you find even a real, do with us what you will. Not all\r\nof us poor folks are thieves!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well then,\" ordered the soldier slowly, as he fixed his gaze on\r\nSisa's eyes, \"come with us. Your sons will show up and try to get\r\nrid of the money they stole. Come on!\"\r\n\r\n\"I--go with you?\" murmured the woman, as she stepped backward and\r\ngazed fearfully at their uniforms. \"And why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, have pity on me!\" she begged, almost on her knees. \"I'm very\r\npoor, so I've neither gold nor jewels to offer you. The only thing\r\nI had you've already taken, and that is the hen which I was thinking\r\nof selling. Take everything that you find in the house, but leave me\r\nhere in peace, leave me here to die!\"\r\n\r\n\"Go ahead! You're got to go, and if you don't move along willingly,\r\nwe'll tie you.\"\r\n\r\nSisa broke out into bitter weeping, but those men were inflexible. \"At\r\nleast, let me go ahead of you some distance,\" she begged, when she\r\nfelt them take hold of her brutally and push her along.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers seemed to be somewhat affected and, after whispering\r\napart, one of them said: \"All right, since from here until we get into\r\nthe town, you might be able to escape, you'll walk between us. Once\r\nthere you may walk ahead twenty paces, but take care that you don't\r\ndelay and that you don't go into any shop, and don't stop. Go ahead,\r\nquickly!\"\r\n\r\nVain were her supplications and arguments, useless her promises. The\r\nsoldiers said that they had already compromised themselves by having\r\nconceded too much. Upon finding herself between them she felt as if\r\nshe would die of shame. No one indeed was coming along the road, but\r\nhow about the air and the light of day? True shame encounters eyes\r\neverywhere. She covered her face with her pañuelo and walked along\r\nblindly, weeping in silence at her disgrace. She had felt misery and\r\nknew what it was to be abandoned by every one, even her own husband,\r\nbut until now she had considered herself honored and respected: up\r\nto this time she had looked with compassion on those boldly dressed\r\nwomen whom the town knew as the concubines of the soldiers. Now it\r\nseemed to her that she had fallen even a step lower than they in the\r\nsocial scale.\r\n\r\nThe sound of hoofs was heard, proceeding from a small train of men\r\nand women mounted on poor nags, each between two baskets hung over\r\nthe back of his mount; it was a party carrying fish to the interior\r\ntowns. Some of them on passing her hut had often asked for a drink of\r\nwater and had presented her with some fishes. Now as they passed her\r\nthey seemed to beat and trample upon her while their compassionate\r\nor disdainful looks penetrated through her pañuelo and stung her\r\nface. When these travelers had finally passed she sighed and raised the\r\npañuelo an instant to see how far she still was from the town. There\r\nyet remained a few telegraph poles to be passed before reaching the\r\n_bantayan_, or little watch-house, at the entrance to the town. Never\r\nhad that distance seemed so great to her.\r\n\r\nBeside the road there grew a leafy bamboo thicket in whose shade she\r\nhad rested at other times, and where her lover had talked so sweetly as\r\nhe helped her carry her basket of fruit and vegetables. Alas, all that\r\nwas past, like a dream! The lover had become her husband and a cabeza\r\nde barangay, and then trouble had commenced to knock at her door. As\r\nthe sun was beginning to shine hotly, the soldiers asked her if she did\r\nnot want to rest there. \"Thanks, no!\" was the horrified woman's answer.\r\n\r\nReal terror seized her when they neared the town. She threw her\r\nanguished gaze in all directions, but no refuge offered itself,\r\nonly wide rice-fields, a small irrigating ditch, and some stunted\r\ntrees; there was not a cliff or even a rock upon which she might dash\r\nherself to pieces! Now she regretted that she had come so far with\r\nthe soldiers; she longed for the deep river that flowed by her hut,\r\nwhose high and rock-strewn banks would have offered such a sweet\r\ndeath. But again the thought of her sons, especially of Crispin, of\r\nwhose fate she was still ignorant, lightened the darkness of her night,\r\nand she was able to murmur resignedly, \"Afterwards--afterwards--we'll\r\ngo and live in the depths of the forest.\"\r\n\r\nDrying her eyes and trying to look calm, she turned to her guards and\r\nsaid in a low voice, with an indefinable accent that was a complaint\r\nand a lament, a prayer and a reproach, sorrow condensed into sound,\r\n\"Now we're in the town.\" Even the soldiers seemed touched as they\r\nanswered her with a gesture. She struggled to affect a calm bearing\r\nwhile she went forward quickly.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the church bells began to peal out, announcing the end\r\nof the high mass. Sisa hurried her steps so as to avoid, if possible,\r\nmeeting the people who were coming out, but in vain, for no means\r\noffered to escape encountering them. With a bitter smile she saluted\r\ntwo of her acquaintances, who merely turned inquiring glances upon\r\nher, so that to avoid further mortification she fixed her gaze on\r\nthe ground, and yet, strange to say, she stumbled over the stones in\r\nthe road! Upon seeing her, people paused for a moment and conversed\r\namong themselves as they gazed at her, all of which she saw and felt\r\nin spite of her downcast eyes.\r\n\r\nShe heard the shameless tones of a woman who asked from behind at the\r\ntop of her voice, \"Where did you catch her? And the money?\" It was a\r\nwoman without a tapis, or tunic, dressed in a green and yellow skirt\r\nand a camisa of blue gauze, easily recognizable from her costume as\r\na _querida_ of the soldiery. Sisa felt as if she had received a slap\r\nin the face, for that woman had exposed her before the crowd. She\r\nraised her eyes for a moment to get her fill of scorn and hate, but\r\nsaw the people far, far away. Yet she felt the chill of their stares\r\nand heard their whispers as she moved over the ground almost without\r\nknowing that she touched it.\r\n\r\n\"Eh, this way!\" a guard called to her. Like an automaton whose\r\nmechanism is breaking, she whirled about rapidly on her heels, then\r\nwithout seeing or thinking of anything ran to hide herself. She\r\nmade out a door where a sentinel stood and tried to enter it, but\r\na still more imperious voice called her aside. With wavering steps\r\nshe sought the direction of that voice, then felt herself pushed\r\nalong by the shoulders; she shut her eyes, took a couple of steps,\r\nand lacking further strength, let herself fall to the ground, first\r\non her knees and then in a sitting posture. Dry and voiceless sobs\r\nshook her frame convulsively.\r\n\r\nNow she was in the barracks among the soldiers, women, hogs, and\r\nchickens. Some of the men were sewing at their clothes while their\r\nthighs furnished pillows for their _queridas_, who were reclining\r\non benches, smoking and gazing wearily at the ceiling. Other women\r\nwere helping some of the men clean their ornaments and arms, humming\r\ndoubtful songs the while.\r\n\r\n\"It seems that the chicks have escaped, for you've brought only the\r\nold hen!\" commented one woman to the new arrivals,--whether alluding\r\nto Sisa or the still clucking hen is not certain.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the hen is always worth more than the chicks,\" Sisa herself\r\nanswered when she observed that the soldiers were silent.\r\n\r\n\"Where's the sergeant?\" asked one of the guards in a disgusted\r\ntone. \"Has report been made to the alferez yet?\"\r\n\r\nA general shrugging of shoulders was his answer, for no one was going\r\nto trouble himself inquiring about the fate of a poor woman.\r\n\r\nThere Sisa spent two hours in a state of semi-idiocy, huddled in a\r\ncorner with her head hidden in her arms and her hair falling down in\r\ndisorder. At noon the alferez was informed, and the first thing that\r\nhe did was to discredit the curate's accusation.\r\n\r\n\"Bah! Tricks of that rascally friar,\" he commented, as he ordered\r\nthat the woman be released and that no one should pay any attention\r\nto the matter. \"If he wants to get back what he's lost, let him ask\r\nSt. Anthony or complain to the nuncio. Out with her!\"\r\n\r\nConsequently, Sisa was ejected from the barracks almost violently,\r\nas she did not try to move herself. Finding herself in the street, she\r\ninstinctively started to hurry toward her house, with her head bared,\r\nher hair disheveled, and her gaze fixed on the distant horizon. The sun\r\nburned in its zenith with never a cloud to shade its flashing disk;\r\nthe wind shook the leaves of the trees lightly along the dry road,\r\nwhile no bird dared stir from the shade of their branches.\r\n\r\nAt last Sisa reached her hut and entered it in silence, She walked all\r\nabout it and ran in and out for a time. Then she hurried to old Tasio's\r\nhouse and knocked at the door, but he was not at home. The unhappy\r\nwoman then returned to her hut and began to call loudly for Basilio\r\nand Crispin, stopping every few minutes to listen attentively. Her\r\nvoice came back in an echo, for the soft murmur of the water in the\r\nneighboring river and the rustling of the bamboo leaves were the\r\nonly sounds that broke the stillness. She called again and again as\r\nshe climbed the low cliffs, or went down into a gully, or descended\r\nto the river. Her eyes rolled about with a sinister expression, now\r\nflashing up with brilliant gleams, now becoming obscured like the\r\nsky on a stormy night; it might be said that the light of reason was\r\nflickering and about to be extinguished.\r\n\r\nAgain returning to her hut, she sat down on the mat where she had\r\nlain the night before. Raising her eyes, she saw a twisted remnant\r\nfrom Basilio's camisa at the end of the bamboo post in the _dinding_,\r\nor wall, that overlooked the precipice. She seized and examined it\r\nin the sunlight. There were blood stains on it, but Sisa hardly saw\r\nthem, for she went outside and continued to raise and lower it before\r\nher eyes to examine it in the burning sunlight. The light was failing\r\nand everything beginning to grow dark around her. She gazed wide-eyed\r\nand unblinkingly straight at the sun.\r\n\r\nStill wandering about here and there, crying and wailing, she would\r\nhave frightened any listener, for her voice now uttered rare notes such\r\nas are not often produced in the human throat. In a night of roaring\r\ntempest, when the whirling winds beat with invisible wings against\r\nthe crowding shadows that ride upon it, if you should find yourself\r\nin a solitary and ruined building, you would hear moans and sighs\r\nwhich you might suppose to be the soughing of the wind as it beats\r\non the high towers and moldering walls to fill you with terror and\r\nmake you shudder in spite of yourself; as mournful as those unknown\r\nsounds of the dark night when the tempest roars were the accents of\r\nthat mother. In this condition night came upon her. Perhaps Heaven\r\nhad granted some hours of sleep while the invisible wing of an angel,\r\nbrushing over her pallid countenance, might wipe out the sorrows\r\nfrom her memory; perhaps such suffering was too great for weak human\r\nendurance, and Providence had intervened with its sweet remedy,\r\nforgetfulness. However that may be, the next day Sisa wandered about\r\nsmiling, singing, and talking with all the creatures of wood and field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nLights and Shadows\r\n\r\n\r\nThree days have passed since the events narrated, three days which\r\nthe town of San Diego has devoted to making preparations for the\r\nfiesta, commenting and murmuring at the same time. While all were\r\nenjoying the prospect of the pleasures to come, some spoke ill of the\r\ngobernadorcillo, others of the teniente-mayor, others of the young men,\r\nand there were not lacking those who blamed everybody for everything.\r\n\r\nThere was a great deal of comment on the arrival of Maria Clara,\r\naccompanied by her Aunt Isabel. All rejoiced over it because they loved\r\nher and admired her beauty, while at the same time they wondered at the\r\nchange that had come over Padre Salvi. \"He often becomes inattentive\r\nduring the holy services, nor does he talk much with us, and he is\r\nthinner and more taciturn than usual,\" commented his penitents. The\r\ncook noticed him getting thinner and thinner by minutes and complained\r\nof the little honor that was done to his dishes. But that which caused\r\nthe most comment among the people was the fact that in the convento\r\nwere to be seen more than two lights burning during the evening while\r\nPadre Salvi was on a visit to a private dwelling--the home of Maria\r\nClara! The pious women crossed themselves but continued their comments.\r\n\r\nIbarra had telegraphed from the capital of the province welcoming Aunt\r\nIsabel and her niece, but had failed to explain the reason for his\r\nabsence. Many thought him a prisoner on account of his treatment of\r\nPadre Salvi on the afternoon of All Saints, but the comments reached\r\na climax when, on the evening of the third day, they saw him alight\r\nbefore the home of his fiancée and extend a polite greeting to the\r\npriest, who was just entering the same house.\r\n\r\nSisa and her sons were forgotten by all.\r\n\r\nIf we should now go into the home of Maria Clara, a beautiful nest\r\nset among trees of orange and ilang-ilang, we should surprise the two\r\nyoung people at a window overlooking the lake, shadowed by flowers\r\nand climbing vines which exhaled a delicate perfume. Their lips\r\nmurmured words softer than the rustling of the leaves and sweeter\r\nthan the aromatic odors that floated through the garden. It was the\r\nhour when the sirens of the lake take advantage of the fast falling\r\ntwilight to show their merry heads above the waves to gaze upon the\r\nsetting sun and sing it to rest. It is said that their eyes and hair\r\nare blue, and that they are crowned with white and red water plants;\r\nthat at times the foam reveals their shapely forms, whiter than\r\nthe foam itself, and that when night descends completely they begin\r\ntheir divine sports, playing mysterious airs like those of Æolian\r\nharps. But let us turn to our young people and listen to the end of\r\ntheir conversation. Ibarra was speaking to Maria Clara.\r\n\r\n\"Tomorrow before daybreak your wish shall be fulfilled. I'll arrange\r\neverything tonight so that nothing will be lacking.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I'll write to my girl friends to come. But arrange it so that\r\nthe curate won't be there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because he seems to be watching me. His deep, gloomy eyes trouble\r\nme, and when he fixes them on me I'm afraid. When he talks to me, his\r\nvoice--oh, he speaks of such odd, such strange, such incomprehensible\r\nthings! He asked me once if I have ever dreamed of letters from my\r\nmother. I really believe that he is half-crazy. My friend Sinang and\r\nmy foster-sister, Andeng, say that he is somewhat touched, because\r\nhe neither eats nor bathes and lives in darkness. See to it that he\r\ndoes not come!\"\r\n\r\n\"We can't do otherwise than invite him,\" answered Ibarra\r\nthoughtfully. \"The customs of the country require it. He is in your\r\nhouse and, besides, he has conducted himself nobly toward me. When\r\nthe alcalde consulted him about the business of which I've told you,\r\nhe had only praises for me and didn't try to put the least obstacle\r\nin the way. But I see that you're serious about it, so cease worrying,\r\nfor he won't go in the same boat with us.\"\r\n\r\nLight footsteps were heard. It was the curate, who approached with a\r\nforced smile on his lips. \"The wind is chilly,\" he said, \"and when\r\none catches cold one generally doesn't get rid of it until the hot\r\nweather. Aren't you afraid of catching cold?\" His voice trembled\r\nand his eyes were turned toward the distant horizon, away from the\r\nyoung people.\r\n\r\n\"No, we rather find the night pleasant and the breeze delicious,\"\r\nanswered Ibarra. \"During these months we have our autumn and our\r\nspring. Some leaves fall, but the flowers are always in bloom.\"\r\n\r\nFray Salvi sighed.\r\n\r\n\"I think the union of these two seasons beautiful, with no cold winter\r\nintervening,\" continued Ibarra. \"In February the buds on the trees\r\nwill burst open and in March we'll have the ripe fruit. When the hot\r\nmonth's come we shall go elsewhere.\"\r\n\r\nFray Salvi smiled and began to talk of commonplace things, of the\r\nweather, of the town, and of the fiesta. Maria Clara slipped away on\r\nsome pretext.\r\n\r\n\"Since we are talking of fiestas, allow me to invite you to the one\r\nthat we are going to celebrate tomorrow. It is to be a picnic in the\r\nwoods, which we and our friends are going to hold together.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where will it be held?\"\r\n\r\n\"The young women wish to hold it by the brook in the neighboring wood,\r\nnear to the old balete, so we shall rise early to avoid the sun.\"\r\n\r\nThe priest thought a moment and then answered: \"The invitation is\r\nvery tempting and I accept it to prove to you that I hold no rancor\r\nagainst you. But I shall have to go late, after I've attended to my\r\nduties. Happy are you who are free, entirely free.\"\r\n\r\nA few moments later Ibarra left in order to look after the arrangements\r\nfor the picnic on the next day. The night was dark and in the street\r\nsome one approached and saluted him respectfully.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\" asked Ibarra.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, you don't know my name,\" answered the unknown, \"but I've been\r\nwaiting for you two days.\"\r\n\r\n\"For what purpose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because nowhere has any pity been shown me and they say that I'm an\r\noutlaw, sir. But I've lost my two sons, my wife is insane, and every\r\none says that I deserve what has happened to me.\"\r\n\r\nIbarra looked at the man critically as he asked, \"What do you want\r\nnow?\"\r\n\r\n\"To beg for your pity upon my wife and sons.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't stop now,\" replied Ibarra. \"If you wish to come, you can\r\ntell me as we go along what has happened to you.\"\r\n\r\nThe man thanked him, and the two quickly disappeared in the shadows\r\nalong the dimly lighted street.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nFishing\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stars still glittered in the sapphire arch of heaven and the birds\r\nwere still sleeping among the branches when a merry party, lighted\r\nby torches of resin, commonly called _huepes_, made its way through\r\nthe streets toward the lake. There were five girls, who walked along\r\nrapidly with hands clasped or arms encircling one another's waists,\r\nfollowed by some old women and by servants who were carrying gracefully\r\non their heads baskets of food and dishes. Looking upon the laughing\r\nand hopeful countenances of the young women and watching the wind blow\r\nabout their abundant black hair and the wide folds of their garments,\r\nwe might have taken them for goddesses of the night fleeing from the\r\nday, did we not know that they were Maria Clara and her four friends,\r\nthe merry Sinang, the grave Victoria, the beautiful Iday, and the\r\nthoughtful Neneng of modest and timid beauty. They were conversing\r\nin a lively manner, laughing and pinching one another, whispering in\r\none another's ears and then breaking out into loud laughter.\r\n\r\n\"You'll wake up the people who are still asleep,\" Aunt Isabel\r\nscolded. \"When we were young, we didn't make so much disturbance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither would you get up so early nor would the old folks have been\r\nsuch sleepy-heads,\" retorted little Sinang.\r\n\r\nThey were silent for a short time, then tried to talk in low tones,\r\nbut soon forgot themselves and again filled the street with their\r\nfresh young voices.\r\n\r\n\"Behave as if you were displeased and don't talk to him,\" Sinang was\r\nadvising Maria Clara. \"Scold him so he won't get into bad habits.\"\r\n\r\n \"Don't be so exacting,\" objected Iday.\r\n\r\n\"Be exacting! Don't be foolish! He must be made to obey while he's\r\nonly engaged, for after he's your husband he'll do as he pleases,\"\r\ncounseled little Sinang.\r\n\r\n\"What do you know about that, child?\" her cousin Victoria corrected\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"Sst! Keep quiet, for here they come!\"\r\n\r\nA group of young men, lighting their way with large bamboo torches,\r\nnow came up, marching gravely along to the sound of a guitar.\r\n\r\n\"It sounds like a beggar's guitar,\" laughed Sinang. When the two\r\nparties met it was the women who maintained a serious and formal\r\nattitude, just as if they had never known how to laugh, while on the\r\nother hand the men talked and laughed, asking six questions to get\r\nhalf an answer.\r\n\r\n\"Is the lake calm? Do you think we'll have good weather?\" asked\r\nthe mothers.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be alarmed, ladies, I know how to swim well,\" answered a tall,\r\nthin, emaciated youth.\r\n\r\n\"We ought to have heard mass first,\" sighed Aunt Isabel, clasping\r\nher hands.\r\n\r\n\"There's yet time, ma'am. Albino has been a theological student in\r\nhis day and can say it in the boat,\" remarked another youth, pointing\r\nto the tall, thin one who had first spoken. The latter, who had a\r\nclownish countenance, threw himself into an attitude of contrition,\r\ncaricaturing Padre Salvi. Ibarra, though he maintained his serious\r\ndemeanor, also joined in the merriment.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived at the beach, there involuntarily escaped from\r\nthe women exclamations of surprise and pleasure at the sight of\r\ntwo large bankas fastened together and picturesquely adorned with\r\ngarlands of flowers, leaves, and ruined cotton of many colors. Little\r\npaper lanterns hung from an improvised canopy amid flowers and\r\nfruits. Comfortable seats with rugs and cushions for the women had\r\nbeen provided by Ibarra. Even the paddles and oars were decorated,\r\nwhile in the more profusely decorated banka were a harp, guitars,\r\naccordions, and a trumpet made from a carabao horn. In the other banka\r\nfires burned on the clay _kalanes_ for preparing refreshments of tea,\r\ncoffee, and _salabat_.\r\n\r\n\"In this boat here the women, and in the other there the men,\" ordered\r\nthe mothers upon embarking. \"Keep quiet! Don't move about so or we'll\r\nbe upset.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cross yourself first,\" advised Aunt Isabel, setting the example.\r\n\r\n\"Are we to be here all alone?\" asked Sinang with a grimace. \"Ourselves\r\nalone?\" This question was opportunely answered by a pinch from\r\nher mother.\r\n\r\nAs the boats moved slowly away from the shore, the light of the\r\nlanterns was reflected in the calm waters of the lake, while in the\r\neastern sky the first tints of dawn were just beginning to appear. A\r\ndeep silence reigned over the party after the division established\r\nby the mothers, for the young people seemed to have given themselves\r\nup to meditation.\r\n\r\n\"Take care,\" said Albino, the ex-theological student, in a loud tone\r\nto another youth. \"Keep your foot tight on the plug under you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"It might come out and let the water in. This banka has a lot of\r\nholes in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we're going to sink!\" cried the frightened women.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be alarmed, ladies,\" the ex-theological student reassured them\r\nto calm their fears. \"The banka you are in is safe. It has only five\r\nholes in it and they aren't large.\"\r\n\r\n\"Five holes! _Jesús!_ Do you want to drown us?\" exclaimed the\r\nhorrified women.\r\n\r\n\"Not more than five, ladies, and only about so large,\" the\r\nex-theological student assured them, indicating the circle formed\r\nwith his index finger and thumb. \"Press hard on the plugs so that\r\nthey won't come out.\"\r\n\r\n\"_María Santísima!_ The water's coming in,\" cried an old woman who\r\nfelt herself already getting wet.\r\n\r\nThere now arose a small tumult; some screamed, while others thought\r\nof jumping into the water.\r\n\r\n\"Press hard on the plugs there!\" repeated Albino, pointing toward\r\nthe place where the girls were.\r\n\r\n\"Where, where? _Diós!_ We don't know how! For pity's sake come here,\r\nfor we don't know how!\" begged the frightened women.\r\n\r\nIt was accordingly necessary for five of the young men to get over\r\ninto the other banka to calm the terrified mothers. But by some\r\nstrange chance it seemed that there w, as danger by the side of each\r\nof the _dalagas_; all the old ladies together did not have a single\r\ndangerous hole near them! Still more strange it was that Ibarra had\r\nto be seated by the side of Maria Clara, Albino beside Victoria,\r\nand so on. Quiet was restored among the solicitous mothers but not\r\nin the circle of the young people.\r\n\r\nAs the water was perfectly still, the fish-corrals not far away,\r\nand the hour yet early, it was decided to abandon the oars so that\r\nall might partake of some refreshment. Dawn had now come, so the\r\nlanterns were extinguished.\r\n\r\n\"There's nothing to compare with _salabat_, drunk in the morning before\r\ngoing to mass,\" said Capitana Tika, mother of the merry Sinang. \"Drink\r\nsome _salabat_ and eat a rice-cake, Albino, and you'll see that even\r\nyou will want to pray.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what I'm doing,\" answered the youth addressed. \"I'm thinking\r\nof confessing myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Sinang, \"drink some coffee to bring merry thoughts.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will, at once, because I feel a trifle sad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't do that,\" advised Aunt Isabel. \"Drink some tea and eat a few\r\ncrackers. They say that tea calms one's thoughts.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll also take some tea and crackers,\" answered the complaisant youth,\r\n\"since fortunately none of these drinks is Catholicism.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, can you--\" Victoria began.\r\n\r\n \"Drink some chocolate also? Well, I guess so, since breakfast is\r\n not so far off.\"\r\n\r\nThe morning was beautiful. The water began to gleam with the light\r\nreflected from the sky with such clearness that every object stood\r\nrevealed without producing a shadow, a bright, fresh clearness\r\npermeated with color, such as we get a hint of in some marine\r\npaintings. All were now merry as they breathed in the light breeze that\r\nbegan to arise. Even the mothers, so full of cautions and warnings,\r\nnow laughed and joked among themselves.\r\n\r\n\"Do you remember,\" one old woman was saying to Capitana Tika,\r\n\"do you remember the time we went to bathe in the river, before we\r\nwere married? In little boats made from banana-stalks there drifted\r\ndown with the current fruits of many kinds and fragrant flowers. The\r\nlittle boats had banners on them and each of us could see her name\r\non one of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"And when we were on our way back home?\" added another, without\r\nletting her go on. \"We found the bamboo bridges destroyed and so we\r\nhad to wade the brooks. The rascals!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know that I chose rather to let the borders of my skirt get\r\nwet than to uncover my feet,\" said Capitana Tika, \"for I knew that\r\nin the thickets on the bank there were eyes watching us.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the girls who heard these reminiscences winked and smiled,\r\nwhile the others were so occupied with their own conversations that\r\nthey took no notice.\r\n\r\nOne man alone, he who performed the duty of pilot, remained silent and\r\nremoved from all the merriment. He was a youth of athletic build and\r\nstriking features, with large, sad eyes and compressed lips. His black\r\nhair, long and unkempt, fell over a stout neck. A dark striped shirt\r\nafforded a suggestion through its folds of the powerful muscles that\r\nenabled the vigorous arms to handle as if it were a pen the wide and\r\nunwieldy paddle which' served as a rudder for steering the two bankas.\r\n\r\nMaria Clara had more than once caught him looking at her, but on such\r\noccasions he had quickly turned his gaze toward the distant mountain\r\nor the shore. The young woman was moved with pity at his loneliness\r\nand offered him some crackers. The pilot gave her a surprised stare,\r\nwhich, however, lasted for only a second. He took a cracker and\r\nthanked her briefly in a scarcely audible voice. After this no one\r\npaid any more attention to him. The sallies and merry laughter of the\r\nyoung folks caused not the slightest movement in the muscles of his\r\nface. Even the merry Sinang did not make him smile when she received\r\npinchings that caused her to wrinkle up her eyebrows for an instant,\r\nonly to return to her former merry mood.\r\n\r\nThe lunch over, they proceeded on their way toward the fish-corrals,\r\nof which there were two situated near each other, both belonging\r\nto Capitan Tiago. From afar were to be seen some herons perched\r\nin contemplative attitude on the tops of the bamboo posts, while\r\na number of white birds, which the Tagalogs call _kalaway_, flew\r\nabout in different directions, skimming the water with their wings\r\nand filling the air with shrill cries. At the approach of the bankas\r\nthe herons took to flight, and Maria Clara followed them with her\r\ngaze as they flew in the direction of the neighboring mountain.\r\n\r\n\"Do those birds build their nests on the mountain?\" she asked the\r\npilot, not so much from a desire to know as for the purpose of making\r\nhim talk.\r\n\r\n\"Probably they do, señora,\" he answered, \"but no one up to this time\r\nhas ever seen their nests.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't they have nests?\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose they must have them, otherwise they would be very\r\nunfortunate.\"\r\n\r\nMaria Clara did not notice the tone of sadness with which he uttered\r\nthese words. \"Then--\"\r\n\r\n\"It is said, señora,\" answered the strange youth, \"that the nests of\r\nthose birds are invisible and that they have the power of rendering\r\ninvisible any one who possesses one of them. Just as the soul can\r\nonly be seen in the pure mirror of the eyes, so also in the mirror\r\nof the water alone can their nests be looked upon.\"\r\n\r\nMaria Clara became sad and thoughtful. Meanwhile, they had reached\r\nthe first fish-corral and an aged boatman tied the craft to a post.\r\n\r\n\"Wait!\" called Aunt Isabel to the son of the fisherman, who was getting\r\nready to climb upon the platform of the corral with his _panalok_,\r\nor fish-net fastened on the end of a stout bamboo pole. \"We must get\r\nthe _sinigang_ ready so that the fish may pass at once from the water\r\ninto the soup.\"\r\n\r\n\"Kind Aunt Isabel!\" exclaimed the ex-theological student. \"She doesn't\r\nwant the fish to miss the water for an instant!\"\r\n\r\nAndeng, Maria Clara's foster-sister, in spite of her carefree and happy\r\nface, enjoyed the reputation of being an excellent cook, so she set\r\nabout preparing a soup of rice and vegetables, helped and hindered by\r\nsome of the young men, eager perhaps to win her favor. The other young\r\nwomen all busied themselves in cutting up and washing the vegetables.\r\n\r\nIn order to divert the impatience of those who were waiting to see the\r\nfishes taken alive and wriggling from their prison, the beautiful Iday\r\ngot out the harp, for Iday not only played well on that instrument,\r\nbut, besides, she had very pretty fingers. The young people applauded\r\nand Maria Clara kissed her, for the harp is the most popular instrument\r\nin that province, and was especially suited to this occasion.\r\n\r\n\"Sing the hymn about marriage,\" begged the old women. The men protested\r\nand Victoria, who had a fine voice, complained of hoarseness. The \"Hymn\r\nof Marriage\" is a beautiful Tagalog chant in which are set forth the\r\ncares and sorrows of the married state, yet not passing over its joys.\r\n\r\nThey then asked Maria Clara to sing, but she protested that all her\r\nsongs were sad ones. This protest, however, was overruled so she held\r\nback no longer. Taking the harp, she played a short prelude and then\r\nsang in a harmonious and vibrating voice full of feeling:\r\n\r\n\r\n        Sweet are the hours in one's native land,\r\n            Where all is dear the sunbeams bless;\r\n        Life-giving breezes sweep the strand,\r\n            And death is soften'd by love's caress.\r\n\r\n        Warm kisses play on mother's lips,\r\n            On her fond, tender breast awaking;\r\n        When round her neck the soft arm slips,\r\n            And bright eyes smile, all love partaking.\r\n\r\n        Sweet is death for one's native land,\r\n            Where all is dear the sunbeams bless;\r\n        Dead is the breeze that sweeps the strand,\r\n            Without a mother, home, or love's caress.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe song ceased, the voice died away, the harp became silent, and they\r\nstill listened; no one applauded. The young women felt their eyes\r\nfill with tears, and Ibarra seemed to be unpleasantly affected. The\r\nyouthful pilot stared motionless into the distance.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a thundering roar was heard, such that the women screamed and\r\ncovered their ears; it was the ex-theological student blowing with all\r\nthe strength of his lungs on the _tambuli_, or carabao horn. Laughter\r\nand cheerfulness returned while tear-dimmed eyes brightened. \"Are\r\nyou trying to deafen us, you heretic?\" cried Aunt Isabel.\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" replied the offender gravely, \"I once heard of a poor\r\ntrumpeter on the banks of the Rhine who, by playing on his trumpet,\r\nwon in marriage a rich and noble maiden.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right, the trumpeter of Sackingen!\" exclaimed Ibarra, unable\r\nto resist taking part in the renewed merriment.\r\n\r\n\"Do you hear that?\" went on Albino. \"Now I want to see if I can't\r\nhave the same luck.\" So saying, he began to blow with even more force\r\ninto the resounding horn, holding it close to the ears of the girls\r\nwho looked saddest. As might be expected, a small tumult arose and\r\nthe mothers finally reduced him to silence by beating him with their\r\nslippers [71] and pinching him.\r\n\r\n\"My, oh my!\" he complained as he felt of his smarting arms, \"what\r\na distance there is between the Philippines and the banks of the\r\nRhine! _O tempora! O mores!_ Some are given honors and others\r\nsanbenitos!\"\r\n\r\nAll laughed at this, even the grave Victoria, while Sinang, she of\r\nthe smiling eyes, whispered to Maria Clara, \"Happy girl! I, too,\r\nwould sing if I could!\"\r\n\r\nAndeng at length announced that the soup was ready to receive its\r\nguests, so the young fisherman climbed up into the pen placed at\r\nthe narrower end of the corral, over which might be written for the\r\nfishes, were they able to read and understand Italian, \"_Lasciate ogni\r\nsperanza voi ch' entrante_,\" [72] for no fish that gets in there is\r\never released except by death. This division of the corral encloses\r\na circular space so arranged that a man can stand on a platform in\r\nthe upper part and draw the fish out with a small net.\r\n\r\n\"I shouldn't get tired fishing there with a pole and line,\" commented\r\nSinang, trembling with pleasant anticipation.\r\n\r\nAll were now watching and some even began to believe that they saw\r\nthe fishes wriggling about in the net and showing their glittering\r\nscales. But when the youth lowered his net not a fish leaped up.\r\n\r\n\"It must be full,\" whispered Albino, \"for it has been over five days\r\nnow since it was visited.\"\r\n\r\nThe fisherman drew in his net, but not even a single little fish\r\nadorned it. The water as it fell back in glittering drops reflecting\r\nthe sunlight seemed to mock his efforts with a silvery smile. An\r\nexclamation of surprise, displeasure, and disappointment escaped from\r\nthe lips of all. Again the youth repeated the operation, but with no\r\nbetter result.\r\n\r\n\"You don't understand your business,\" said Albino, climbing up into\r\nthe pen of the corral and taking the net from the youth's hands. \"Now\r\nyou'll see! Andeng, get the pot ready!\"\r\n\r\nBut apparently Albino did not understand the business either, for\r\nthe net again came up empty. All broke out into laughter at him.\r\n\r\n\"Don't make so much noise that the fish can hear and so not let\r\nthemselves be caught. This net must be torn.\" But on examination all\r\nthe meshes of the net appeared to be intact.\r\n\r\n\"Give it to me,\" said Leon, Iday's sweetheart. He assured himself\r\nthat the fence was in good condition, examined the net and being\r\nsatisfied with it, asked, \"Are you sure that it hasn't been visited\r\nfor five days?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very sure! The last time was on the eve of All Saints.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well then, either the lake is enchanted or I'll draw up something.\"\r\n\r\nLeon then dropped the pole into the water and instantly astonishment\r\nwas pictured on his countenance. Silently he looked off toward the\r\nmountain and moved the pole about in the water, then without raising\r\nit murmured in a low voice:\r\n\r\n\"A cayman!\"\r\n\r\n\"A cayman!\" repeated everyone, as the word ran from mouth to mouth\r\nin the midst of fright and general surprise.\r\n\r\n\"What did you say?\" they asked him.\r\n\r\n\"I say that we're caught a cayman,\" Leon assured them, and as he\r\ndropped the heavy end of the pole into the water, he continued:\r\n\"Don't you hear that sound? That's not sand, but a tough hide, the\r\nback of a cayman. Don't you see how the posts shake? He's pushing\r\nagainst them even though he is all rolled up. Wait, he's a big one,\r\nhis body is almost a foot or more across.\"\r\n\r\n\"What shall we do?\" was the question.\r\n\r\n\"Catch him!\" prompted some one.\r\n\r\n\"Heavens_!_ And who'll catch him?\"\r\n\r\nNo one offered to go down into the trap, for the water was deep.\r\n\r\n\"We ought to tie him to our banka and drag him along in triumph,\"\r\nsuggested Sinang. \"The idea of his eating the fish that we were going\r\nto eat!\"\r\n\r\n\"I have never yet seen a live cayman,\" murmured Maria Clara.\r\n\r\nThe pilot arose, picked up a long rope, and climbed nimbly up on the\r\nplatform, where Leon made room for him. With the exception of Maria\r\nClara, no one had taken any notice of him, but now all admired his\r\nshapely figure. To the great surprise of all and in spite of their\r\ncries, he leaped down into the enclosure.\r\n\r\n\"Take this knife!\" called Crisostomo to him, holding out a wide Toledo\r\nblade, but already the water was splashing up in a thousand jets and\r\nthe depths closed mysteriously.\r\n\r\n\"_Jesús, María, y José_!\" exclaimed the old women. \"We're going to\r\nhave an accident!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be uneasy, ladies,\" said the old boatman, \"for if there is\r\nany one in the province who can do it, he's the man.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's his name?\" they asked.\r\n\r\n\"We call him 'The Pilot' and he's the best I've ever seen, only he\r\ndoesn't like the business.\"\r\n\r\nThe water became disturbed, then broke into ripples, the fence shook;\r\na struggle seemed to be going on in the depths. All were silent\r\nand hardly breathed. Ibarra grasped the handle of the sharp knife\r\nconvulsively.\r\n\r\nNow the struggle seemed to be at an end and the head of the youth\r\nappeared, to be greeted with joyful cries. The eyes of the old women\r\nfilled with tears. The pilot climbed up with one end of the rope in\r\nhis hand and once on the platform began to pull on it. The monster\r\nsoon appeared above the water with the rope tied in a double band\r\naround its neck and underneath its front legs. It was a large one,\r\nas Leon had said, speckled, and on its back grew the green moss which\r\nis to the caymans what gray hairs are to men. Roaring like a bull and\r\nbeating its tail against or catching hold of the sides of the corral,\r\nit opened its huge jaws and showed its long, sharp teeth. The pilot\r\nwas hoisting it alone, for no one had thought to assist him.\r\n\r\nOnce out of the water and resting on the platform, he placed his\r\nfoot upon it and with his strong hands forced its huge jaws together\r\nand tried to tie its snout with stout knots. With a last effort the\r\nreptile arched its body, struck the floor with its powerful tail,\r\nand jerking free, hurled itself with one leap into the water outside\r\nthe corral, dragging its captor along with it. A cry of horror broke\r\nfrom the lips of all. But like a flash of lightning another body shot\r\ninto the water so quickly that there was hardly time to realize that\r\nit was Ibarra. Maria Clara did not swoon only for the reason that\r\nthe Filipino women do not yet know how to do so.\r\n\r\nThe anxious watchers saw the water become colored and dyed with\r\nblood. The young fisherman jumped down with his bolo in his hand and\r\nwas followed by his father, but they had scarcely disappeared when\r\nCrisostomo and the pilot reappeared clinging to the dead body of the\r\nreptile, which had the whole length of its white belly slit open and\r\nthe knife still sticking in its throat.\r\n\r\nTo describe the joy were impossible, as a dozen arms reached out to\r\ndrag the young men from the water. The old women were beside themselves\r\nbetween laughter and prayers. Andeng forgot that her _sinigang_\r\nhad boiled over three times, spilling the soup and putting out the\r\nfire. The only one who could say nothing was Maria Clara.\r\n\r\nIbarra was uninjured, while the pilot had only a slight scratch on\r\nhis arm. \"I owe my life to you,\" said the latter to Ibarra, who was\r\nwrapping himself up in blankets and cloths. The pilot's voice seemed\r\nto have a note of sadness in it.\r\n\r\n\"You are too daring,\" answered Ibarra. \"Don't tempt fate again.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you had not come up again--\" murmured the still pale and trembling\r\nMaria Clara.\r\n\r\n\"If I had not come up and you had followed me,\" replied Ibarra,\r\ncompleting the thought in his own way, \"in the bottom of the lake,\r\n_I should still have been with my family!_\" He had not forgotten that\r\nthere lay the bones of his father.\r\n\r\nThe old women did not want to visit the other corral but wished to\r\nreturn, saying that the day had begun inauspiciously and that many more\r\naccidents might occur. \"All because we didn't hear mass,\" sighed one.\r\n\r\n\"But what accident has befallen us, ladies?\" asked Ibarra. \"The cayman\r\nseems to have been the only unlucky one.\"\r\n\r\n\"All of which proves,\" concluded the ex-student of theology, \"that\r\nin all its sinful life this unfortunate reptile has never attended\r\nmass--at least, I've never seen him among the many other caymans that\r\nfrequent the church.\"\r\n\r\nSo the boats were turned in the direction of the other corral and\r\nAndeng had to get her _sinigang_ ready again. The day was now well\r\nadvanced, with a fresh breeze blowing. The waves curled up behind the\r\nbody of the cayman, raising \"mountains of foam whereon the smooth,\r\nrich sunlight glitters,\" as the poet says. The music again resounded;\r\nIday played on the harp, while the men handled the accordions and\r\nguitars with greater or less skill. The prize-winner was Albino, who\r\nactually scratched the instruments, getting out of tune and losing\r\nthe time every moment or else forgetting it and changing to another\r\ntune entirely different.\r\n\r\nThe second corral was visited with some misgivings, as many expected to\r\nfind there the mate of the dead cayman, but nature is ever a jester,\r\nand the nets came up full at each haul. Aunt Isabel superintended\r\nthe sorting of the fish and ordered that some be left in the trap for\r\ndecoys. \"It's not lucky to empty the corral completely,\" she concluded.\r\n\r\nThen they made their way toward the shore near the forest of old trees\r\nthat belonged to Ibarra. There in the shade by the clear waters of the\r\nbrook, among the flowers, they ate their breakfast under improvised\r\ncanopies. The space was filled with music while the smoke from the\r\nfires curled up in slender wreaths. The water bubbled cheerfully in\r\nthe hot dishes as though uttering sounds of consolation, or perchance\r\nof sarcasm and irony, to the dead fishes. The body of the cayman\r\nwrithed about, sometimes showing its torn white belly and again its\r\nspeckled greenish back, while man, Nature's favorite, went on his\r\nway undisturbed by what the Brahmins and vegetarians would call so\r\nmany cases of fratricide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nIn the Wood\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly, very early indeed, somewhat differently from his usual custom,\r\nPadre Salvi had celebrated mass and cleansed a dozen sinful souls in a\r\nfew moments. Then it seemed that the reading of some letters which he\r\nhad received firmly sealed and waxed caused the worthy curate to lose\r\nhis appetite, since he allowed his chocolate to become completely cold.\r\n\r\n\"The padre is getting sick,\" commented the cook while preparing another\r\ncup. \"For days he hasn't eaten; of the six dishes that I set before\r\nhim on the table he doesn't touch even two.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's because he sleeps badly,\" replied the other servant. \"He has\r\nnightmares since he changed his bedroom. His eyes are becoming more\r\nsunken all the time and he's getting thinner and yellower day by day.\"\r\n\r\nTruly, Padre Salvi was a pitiable sight. He did not care to touch the\r\nsecond cup of chocolate nor to taste the sweet cakes of Cebu; instead,\r\nhe paced thoughtfully about the spacious sala, crumpling in his bony\r\nhands the letters, which he read from time to time. Finally, he called\r\nfor his carriage, got ready, and directed that he be taken to the\r\nwood where stood the fateful tree near which the picnic was being held.\r\n\r\nArriving at the edge of the wood, the padre dismissed his carriage\r\nand made his way alone into its depths. A gloomy pathway opened a\r\ndifficult passage through the thickets and led to the brook formed\r\nby certain warm springs, like many that flow from the slopes of\r\nMr. Makiling. Adorning its banks grow wild flowers, many of which\r\nhave as yet no Latin names, but which are doubtless well-known to\r\nthe gilded insects and butterflies of all shapes and colors, blue and\r\ngold, white and black, many-hued, glittering with iridescent spots,\r\nwith rubies and emeralds on their wings, and to the countless beetles\r\nwith their metallic lusters of powdered gold. The hum of the insects,\r\nthe cries of the cicada, which cease not night or day, the songs of\r\nthe birds, and the dry crashing of the rotten branch that falls and\r\nstrikes all around against the trees, are the only sounds to break\r\nthe stillness of that mysterious place.\r\n\r\nFor some time the padre wandered aimlessly among the thick underbrush,\r\navoiding the thorns that caught at his _guingón_ habit as though to\r\ndetain him, and the roots of the trees that protruded from the soil\r\nto form stumbling-blocks at every step for this wanderer unaccustomed\r\nto such places. But suddenly his feet were arrested by the sound of\r\nclear voices raised in merry laughter, seeming to come from the brook\r\nand apparently drawing nearer.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to see if I can find one of those nests,\" said a beautiful,\r\nsweet voice, which the curate recognized. \"I'd like to see _him_\r\nwithout having him see me, so I could follow him everywhere.\"\r\n\r\nPadre Salvi hid behind the trunk of a large tree and set himself\r\nto eavesdrop.\r\n\r\n\"Does that mean that you want to do with him what the curate does with\r\nyou?\" asked a laughing voice. \"He watches you everywhere. Be careful,\r\nfor jealousy makes people thin and puts rings around their eyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, not jealousy, it's pure curiosity,\" replied the silvery voice,\r\nwhile the laughing one repeated, \"Yes, jealousy, jealousy!\" and she\r\nburst out into merry laughter.\r\n\r\n\"If I were jealous, instead of making myself invisible, I'd make him\r\nso, in order that no one might see him.\"\r\n\r\n\"But neither would you see _him_ and that wouldn't be nice. The best\r\nthing for us to do if we find the nest would be to present it to the\r\ncurate so that he could watch over us without the necessity of our\r\nseeing him, don't you think so?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe in those herons' nests,\" interrupted another voice,\r\n\"but if at any time I should be jealous, I'd know how to watch and\r\nstill keep myself hidden.\"\r\n\r\n\"How, how? Perhaps like a _Sor Escucha?_\" [73]\r\n\r\nThis reminiscence of school-days provoked another merry burst of\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\n\"And you know how she's fooled, the _Sor Escucha!_\"\r\n\r\nFrom his hiding-place Padre Salvi saw Maria Clara, Victoria, and Sinang\r\nwading along the border of the brook. They were moving forward with\r\ntheir eyes fixed on the crystal waters, seeking the enchanted nest of\r\nthe heron, wet to their knees so that the wide folds of their bathing\r\nskirts revealed the graceful curves of their bodies. Their hair was\r\nflung loose, their arms bare, and they wore camisas with wide stripes\r\nof bright hues. While looking for something that they could not find\r\nthey were picking flowers and plants which grew along the bank.\r\n\r\nThe religious Acteon stood pale and motionless gazing at that chaste\r\nDiana, but his eyes glittered in their dark circles, untired of staring\r\nat those white and shapely arms and at that elegant neck and bust,\r\nwhile the small rosy feet that played in the water awoke in his starved\r\nbeing strange sensations and in his burning brain dreams of new ideas.\r\n\r\nThe three charming figures disappeared behind a bamboo thicket\r\naround a bend in the brook, and their cruel allusions ceased to be\r\nheard. Intoxicated, staggering, covered with perspiration, Padre Salvi\r\nleft his hiding-place and looked all about him with rolling eyes. He\r\nstood still as if in doubt, then took a few steps as though he would\r\ntry to follow the girls, but turned again and made his way along the\r\nbanks of the stream to seek the rest of the party.\r\n\r\nAt a little distance he saw in the middle of the brook a kind of\r\nbathing-place, well enclosed, decorated with palm leaves, flowers,\r\nand streamers, with a leafy clump of bamboo for a covering, from\r\nwithin which came the sound of happy feminine voices. Farther on\r\nhe saw a bamboo bridge and beyond it the men bathing. Near these a\r\ncrowd of servants was busily engaged around improvised _kalanes_ in\r\nplucking chickens, washing rice, and roasting a pig. On the opposite\r\nbank in a cleared space were gathered men and women under a canvas\r\ncovering which was fastened partly to the hoary trees and partly to\r\nnewly-driven stakes. There were gathered the alferez, the coadjutor,\r\nthe gobernadorcillo, the teniente-mayor, the schoolmaster, and many\r\nother personages of the town, even including Sinang's father, Capitan\r\nBasilio, who had been the adversary of the deceased Don Rafael in\r\nan old lawsuit. Ibarra had said to him, \"We are disputing over a\r\npoint of law, but that does not mean that we are enemies,\" so the\r\ncelebrated orator of the conservatives had enthusiastically accepted\r\nthe invitation, sending along three turkeys and putting his servants\r\nat the young man's disposal.\r\n\r\nThe curate was received with respect and deference by all, even the\r\nalferez. \"Why, where has your Reverence been?\" asked the latter,\r\nas he noticed the curate's scratched face and his habit covered with\r\nleaves and dry twigs. \"Has your Reverence had a fall?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I lost my way,\" replied Padre Salvi, lowering his gaze to examine\r\nhis gown.\r\n\r\nBottles of lemonade were brought out and green coconuts were split\r\nopen so that the bathers as they came from the water might refresh\r\nthemselves with the milk and the soft meat, whiter than the milk\r\nitself. The girls all received in addition rosaries of sampaguitas,\r\nintertwined with roses and ilang-ilang blossoms, to perfume their\r\nflowing tresses. Some of the company sat on the ground or reclined\r\nin hammocks swung from the branches of the trees, while others\r\namused themselves around a wide flat rock on which were to be seen\r\nplaying-cards, a chess-board, booklets, cowry shells, and pebbles.\r\n\r\nThey showed the cayman to the curate, but he seemed inattentive\r\nuntil they told him that the gaping wound had been inflicted by\r\nIbarra. The celebrated and unknown pilot was no longer to be seen,\r\nas he had disappeared before the arrival of the alferez.\r\n\r\nAt length Maria Clara came from the bath with her companions, looking\r\nfresh as a rose on its first morning when the dew sparkling on its fair\r\npetals glistens like diamonds. Her first smile was for Crisostomo and\r\nthe first cloud on her brow for Padre Salvi, who noted it and sighed.\r\n\r\nThe lunch hour was now come, and the curate, the coadjutor, the\r\ngobernadorcillo, the teniente-mayor, and the other dignitaries took\r\ntheir seats at the table over which Ibarra presided. The mothers\r\nwould not permit any of the men to eat at the table where the young\r\nwomen sat.\r\n\r\n\"This time, Albino, you can't invent holes as in the bankas,\" said\r\nLeon to the quondam student of theology. \"What_!_ What's that?\" asked\r\nthe old women.\r\n\r\n\"The bankas, ladies, were as whole as this plate is,\" explained Leon.\r\n\r\n\"_Jesús!_ The rascal!\" exclaimed the smiling Aunt Isabel.\r\n\r\n\"Have you yet learned anything of the criminal who assaulted Padre\r\nDamaso?\" inquired Fray Salvi of the alferez.\r\n\r\n\"Of what criminal, Padre?\" asked the military man, staring at the\r\nfriar over the glass of wine that he was emptying,\r\n\r\n\"What criminal! Why, the one who struck Padre Damaso in the road\r\nyesterday afternoon!\"\r\n\r\n\"Struck Padre Damaso?\" asked several voices.\r\n\r\nThe coadjutor seemed to smile, while Padre Salvi went on: \"Yes, and\r\nPadre Damaso is now confined to his bed. It's thought that he may be\r\nthe very same Elias who threw you into the mudhole, señor alferez.\"\r\n\r\nEither from shame or wine the alferez's face became very red.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, I thought,\" continued Padre Salvi in a joking manner,\r\n\"that you, the alferez of the Civil Guard, would be informed about\r\nthe affair.\"\r\n\r\nThe soldier bit his lip and was murmuring some foolish excuse, when\r\nthe meal was suddenly interrupted by the appearance of a pale, thin,\r\npoorly-clad woman. No one had noticed her approach, for she had come\r\nso noiselessly that at night she might have been taken for a ghost.\r\n\r\n\"Give this poor woman something to eat,\" cried the old women. \"_Oy_,\r\ncome here!\"\r\n\r\nStill the strange woman kept on her way to the table where the\r\ncurate was seated. As he turned his face and recognized her, his\r\nknife dropped from his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Give this woman something to eat,\" ordered Ibarra.\r\n\r\n\"The night is dark and the boys disappear,\" murmured the wandering\r\nwoman, but at sight of the alferez, who spoke to her, she became\r\nfrightened and ran away among the trees.\r\n\r\n\"Who is she?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"An unfortunate woman who has become insane from fear and sorrow,\"\r\nanswered Don Filipo. \"For four days now she has been so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is her name Sisa?\" asked Ibarra with interest.\r\n\r\n\"Your soldiers arrested her,\" continued the teniente-mayor, rather\r\nbitterly, to the alferez. \"They marched her through the town on\r\naccount of something about her sons which isn't very clearly known.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" exclaimed the alferez, turning to the curate, \"she isn't the\r\nmother of your two sacristans?\"\r\n\r\nThe curate nodded in affirmation.\r\n\r\n\"They disappeared and nobody made any inquiries about them,\" added Don\r\nFilipo with a severe look at the gobernadorcillo, who dropped his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Look for that woman,\" Crisostomo ordered the servants. \"I promised\r\nto try to learn where her sons are.\"\r\n\r\n\"They disappeared, did you say?\" asked the alferez. \"Your sacristans\r\ndisappeared, Padre?\"\r\n\r\nThe friar emptied the glass of wine before him and again nodded.\r\n\r\n\"_Caramba_, Padre!\" exclaimed the alferez with a sarcastic laugh,\r\npleased at the thought of a little revenge. \"A few pesos of your\r\nReverence's disappear and my sergeant is routed out early to hunt for\r\nthem--two sacristans disappear and your Reverence says nothing--and\r\nyou, señor capitan--It's also true that you--\"\r\n\r\nHere he broke off with another laugh as he buried his spoon in the\r\nred meat of a wild papaya.\r\n\r\nThe curate, confused, and not over-intent upon what he was saying,\r\nreplied, \"That's because I have to answer for the money--\"\r\n\r\n\"A good answer, reverend shepherd of souls!\" interrupted the alferez\r\nwith his mouth full of food. \"A splendid answer, holy man!\"\r\n\r\nIbarra wished to intervene, but Padre Salvi controlled himself by\r\nan effort and said with a forced smile, \"Then you don't know, sir,\r\nwhat is said about the disappearance of those boys? No? Then ask\r\nyour soldiers!\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" exclaimed the alferez, all his mirth gone.\r\n\r\n\"It's said that on the night they disappeared several shots were\r\nheard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Several shots?\" echoed the alferez, looking around at the other\r\nguests, who nodded their heads in corroboration of the padre's\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\nPadre Salvi then replied slowly and with cutting sarcasm: \"Come now,\r\nI see that you don't catch the criminals nor do you know what is going\r\non in your own house, yet you try to set yourself up as a preacher\r\nto point out their duties to others. You ought to keep in mind that\r\nproverb about the fool in his own house--\" [74]\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen!\" interrupted Ibarra, seeing that the alferez had grown\r\npale. \"In this connection I should like to have your opinion about a\r\nproject of mine. I'm thinking of putting this crazy woman under the\r\ncare of a skilful physician and, in the meantime, with your aid and\r\nadvice, I'll search for her sons.\"\r\n\r\nThe return of the servants without the madwoman, whom they had been\r\nunable to find, brought peace by turning the conversation to other\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\nThe meal ended, and while the tea and coffee were being served,\r\nboth old and young scattered about in different groups. Some took the\r\nchessmen, others the cards, while the girls, curious about the future,\r\nchose to put questions to a _Wheel of Fortune_.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Señor Ibarra,\" called Capitan Basilio in merry mood, \"we have\r\na lawsuit fifteen years old, and there isn't a judge in the Audiencia\r\nwho can settle it. Let's see if we can't end it on the chess-board.\"\r\n\r\n\"With the greatest pleasure,\" replied the youth. \"Just wait a moment,\r\nthe alferez is leaving.\"\r\n\r\nUpon hearing about this match all the old men who understood chess\r\ngathered around the board, for it promised to be an interesting one,\r\nand attracted even spectators who were not familiar with the game. The\r\nold women, however, surrounded the curate in order to converse with him\r\nabout spiritual matters, but Fray Salvi apparently did not consider\r\nthe place and time appropriate, for he gave vague answers and his\r\nsad, rather bored, looks wandered in all directions except toward\r\nhis questioners.\r\n\r\nThe chess-match began with great solemnity. \"If this game ends in a\r\ndraw, it's understood that the lawsuit is to be dropped,\" said Ibarra.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the game Ibarra received a telegram which caused\r\nhis eyes to shine and his face to become pale. He put it into his\r\npocketbook, at the same time glancing toward the group of young people,\r\nwho were still with laughter and shouts putting questions to Destiny.\r\n\r\n\"Check to the king!\" called the youth.\r\n\r\nCapitan Basilio had no other recourse than to hide the piece behind\r\nthe queen.\r\n\r\n\"Check to the queen!\" called the youth as he threatened that piece\r\nwith a rook which was defended by a pawn.\r\n\r\nBeing unable to protect the queen or to withdraw the piece on account\r\nof the king behind it, Capitan Basilio asked for time to reflect.\r\n\r\n\"Willingly,\" agreed Ibarra, \"especially as I have something to say this\r\nvery minute to those young people in that group over there.\" He arose\r\nwith the agreement that his opponent should have a quarter of an hour.\r\n\r\nIday had the round card on which were written the forty-eight\r\nquestions, while Albino held the book of answers.\r\n\r\n\"A lie! It's not so!\" cried Sinang, half in tears.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\" asked Maria Clara.\r\n\r\n\"Just imagine, I asked, 'When shall I have some sense?' I threw the\r\ndice and that worn-out priest read from the book, 'When the frogs\r\nraise hair.' What do you think of that?\" As she said this, Sinang\r\nmade a grimace at the laughing ex-theological student.\r\n\r\n\"Who told you to ask that question?\" her cousin Victoria asked her. \"To\r\nask it is enough to deserve such an answer.\"\r\n\r\n\"You ask a question,\" they said to Ibarra, offering him the\r\nwheel. \"We're decided that whoever gets the best answer shall receive\r\na present from the rest. Each of us has already had a question.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who got the best answer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Maria Clara, Maria Clara!\" replied Sinang. \"We made her ask,\r\nwilly-nilly, 'Is your sweetheart faithful and constant?' And the\r\nbook answered--\"\r\n\r\nBut here the blushing Maria Clara put her hands over Sinang's mouth\r\nso that she could not finish.\r\n\r\n\"Well, give me the wheel,\" said Crisostomo, smiling. \"My question is,\r\n'Shall I succeed in my present enterprise?'\"\r\n\r\n\"What an ugly question!\" exclaimed Sinang.\r\n\r\nIbarra threw the dice and in accordance with the resulting number\r\nthe page and line were sought.\r\n\r\n\"Dreams are dreams,\" read Albino.\r\n\r\nIbarra drew out the telegram and opened it with trembling hands. \"This\r\ntime your book is wrong!\" he exclaimed joyfully. \"Read this: 'School\r\nproject approved. Suit decided in your favor.'\"\r\n\r\n\"What does it mean?\" all asked.\r\n\r\n\"Didn't you say that a present is to be given to the one receiving\r\nthe best answer?\" he asked in a voice shaking with emotion as he tore\r\nthe telegram carefully into two pieces.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well then, this is my present,\" he said as he gave one piece to\r\nMaria Clara. \"A school for boys and girls is to be built in the town\r\nand this school is my present.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the other part, what does it mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's to be given to the one who has received the worst answer.\"\r\n\r\n\"To me, then, to me!\" cried Sinang.\r\n\r\nIbarra gave her the other piece of the telegram and hastily withdrew.\r\n\r\n\"What does it mean?\" she asked, but the happy youth was already at\r\na distance, returning to the game of chess.\r\n\r\nFray Salvi in abstracted mood approached the circle of young\r\npeople. Maria Clara wiped away her tears of joy, the laughter ceased,\r\nand the talk died away. The curate stared at the young people without\r\noffering to say anything, while they silently waited for him to speak.\r\n\r\n\"What's this?\" he at length asked, picking up the book and turning\r\nits leaves.\r\n\r\n\"_The Wheel of Fortune_, a book of games,\" replied Leon.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you know that it's a sin to believe in these things?\" he\r\nscolded, tearing the leaves out angrily.\r\n\r\nCries of surprise and anger escaped from the lips of all.\r\n\r\n\"It's a greater sin to dispose of what isn't yours, against the wish\r\nof the owner,\" contradicted Albino, rising. \"Padre, that's what is\r\ncalled stealing and it is forbidden by God and men!\"\r\n\r\nMaria Clara clasped her hands and gazed with tearful eyes at the\r\nremnants of the book which a few moments before had been the source\r\nof so much happiness for her.\r\n\r\nContrary to the general expectation, Fray Salvi did not reply to\r\nAlbino, but stood staring at the torn leaves as they were whirled\r\nabout, some falling in the wood, some in the water, then he staggered\r\naway with his hands over his head. He stopped for a few moments\r\nto speak with Ibarra, who accompanied him to one of the carriages,\r\nwhich were at the disposal of the guests.\r\n\r\n\"He's doing well to leave, that kill-joy,\" murmured Sinang. \"He has\r\na face that seems to say, 'Don't laugh, for I know about your sins!'\"\r\n\r\nAfter making the present to his fiancée, Ibarra was so happy that\r\nhe began to play without reflection or a careful examination of the\r\npositions of the pieces. The result was that although Capitan Basilio\r\nwas hard pressed the game became a stalemate, owing to many careless\r\nmoves on the young man's part.\r\n\r\n\"It's settled, we're at peace!\" exclaimed Capitan Basilio heartily.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we're at peace,\" repeated the youth, \"whatever the decision of\r\nthe court may be.\" And the two shook hands cordially.\r\n\r\nWhile all present were rejoicing over this happy termination of a\r\nquarrel of which both parties were tired, the sudden arrival of a\r\nsergeant and four soldiers of the Civil Guard, all armed and with\r\nbayonets fixed, disturbed the mirth and caused fright among the women.\r\n\r\n\"Keep still, everybody!\" shouted the sergeant. \"Shoot any one who\r\nmoves!\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of this blustering command, Ibarra arose and approached the\r\nsergeant. \"What do you want?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"That you deliver to us at once a criminal named Elias, who was your\r\npilot this morning,\" was the threatening reply.\r\n\r\n\"A criminal--the pilot? You must be mistaken,\" answered Ibarra.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, this Elias has just been accused of putting his hand on\r\na priest--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, was that the pilot?\"\r\n\r\n\"The very same, according to reports. You admit persons of bad\r\ncharacter into your fiestas, Señor Ibarra.\"\r\n\r\nIbarra looked him over from head to foot and replied with great\r\ndisdain, \"I don't have to give you an account of my actions! At our\r\nfiestas all are welcome. Had you yourself come, you would have found\r\na place at our table, just as did your alferez, who was with us a\r\ncouple of hours ago.\" With this he turned his back.\r\n\r\nThe sergeant gnawed at the ends of his mustache but, considering\r\nhimself the weaker party, ordered the soldiers to institute a search,\r\nespecially among the trees, for the pilot, a description of whom he\r\ncarried on a piece of paper.\r\n\r\nDon Filipo said to him, \"Notice that this description fits nine tenths\r\nof the natives. Don't make any false move!\"\r\n\r\nAfter a time the soldiers returned with the report that they\r\nhad been unable to see either banka or man that could be called\r\nsuspicious-looking, so the sergeant muttered a few words and went\r\naway as he had come--in the manner of the Civil Guard!\r\n\r\nThe merriment was little by little restored, amid questions and\r\ncomments.\r\n\r\n\"So that's the Elias who threw the alferez into the mudhole,\" said\r\nLeon thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\"How did that happen? How was it?\" asked some of the more curious.\r\n\r\n\"They say that on a very rainy day in September the alferez met a man\r\nwho was carrying a bundle of firewood. The road was very muddy and\r\nthere was only a narrow path at the side, wide enough for but one\r\nperson. They say that the alferez, instead of reining in his pony,\r\nput spurs to it, at the same time calling to the man to get out\r\nof the way. It seemed that this man, on account of the heavy load\r\nhe was carrying on his shoulder, had little relish for going back\r\nnor did he want to be swallowed up in the mud, so he continued on\r\nhis way forward. The alferez in irritation tried to knock him down,\r\nbut he snatched a piece of wood from his bundle and struck the pony\r\non the head with such great force that it fell, throwing its rider\r\ninto the mud. They also say that the man went on his way tranquilly\r\nwithout taking any notice of the five bullets that were fired after\r\nhim by the alferez, who was blind with mud and rage. As the man was\r\nentirely unknown to him it was supposed that he might be the famous\r\nElias who came to the province several months ago, having come from\r\nno one knows where. He has given the Civil Guard cause to know him\r\nin several towns for similar actions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then he's a tulisan?\" asked Victoria shuddering.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think so, for they say that he fought against some tulisanes\r\none day when they were robbing a house.\"\r\n\r\n\"He hasn't the look of a criminal,\" commented Sinang.\r\n\r\n\"No, but he looks very sad. I didn't see him smile the whole morning,\"\r\nadded Maria Clara thoughtfully.\r\n\r\nSo the afternoon passed away and the hour for returning to the\r\ntown came. Under the last rays of the setting sun they left\r\nthe woods, passing in silence by the mysterious tomb of Ibarra's\r\nancestors. Afterwards, the merry talk was resumed in a lively manner,\r\nfull of warmth, beneath those branches so little accustomed to hear\r\nso many voices. The trees seemed sad, while the vines swung back and\r\nforth as if to say, \"Farewell, youth! Farewell, dream of a day!\"\r\n\r\nNow in the light of the great red torches of bamboo and with the\r\nsound of the guitars let us leave them on the road to the town. The\r\ngroups grow smaller, the lights are extinguished, the songs die away,\r\nand the guitar becomes silent as they approach the abodes of men. Put\r\non the mask now that you are once more amongst your kind!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nIn the House of the Sage\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the following day, Ibarra, after visiting his lands,\r\nmade his way to the home of old Tasio. Complete stillness reigned in\r\nthe garden, for even the swallows circling about the eaves scarcely\r\nmade any noise. Moss grew on the old wall, over which a kind of ivy\r\nclambered to form borders around the windows. The little house seemed\r\nto be the abode of silence.\r\n\r\nIbarra hitched his horse carefully to a post and walking almost on\r\ntiptoe crossed the clean and well-kept garden to the stairway, which\r\nhe ascended, and as the door was open, he entered. The first sight that\r\nmet his gaze was the old man bent over a book in which he seemed to be\r\nwriting. On the walls were collections of insects and plants arranged\r\namong maps and stands filled with books and manuscripts. The old man\r\nwas so absorbed in his work that he did not notice the presence of the\r\nyouth until the latter, not wishing to disturb him, tried to retire.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you here?\" he asked, gazing at Ibarra with a strange\r\nexpression. \"Excuse me,\" answered the youth, \"I see that you're\r\nvery busy--\"\r\n\r\n\"True, I was writing a little, but it's not urgent, and I want to\r\nrest. Can I do anything for you?\"\r\n\r\n\"A great deal,\" answered Ibarra, drawing nearer, \"but--\"\r\n\r\nA glance at the book on the table caused him to exclaim in surprise,\r\n\"What, are you given to deciphering hieroglyphics?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied the old man, as he offered his visitor a chair. \"I don't\r\nunderstand Egyptian or Coptic either, but I know something about the\r\nsystem of writing, so I write in hieroglyphics.\"\r\n\r\n\"You write in hieroglyphics! Why?\" exclaimed the youth, doubting what\r\nhe saw and heard.\r\n\r\n\"So that I cannot be read now.\"\r\n\r\nIbarra gazed at him fixedly, wondering to himself if the old man were\r\nnot indeed crazy. He examined the book rapidly to learn if he was\r\ntelling the truth and saw neatly drawn figures of animals, circles,\r\nsemicircles, flowers, feet, hands, arms, and such things.\r\n\r\n\"But why do you write if you don't want to be read?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I'm not writing for this generation, but for other ages. If\r\nthis generation could read, it would burn my books, the labor of\r\nmy whole life. But the generation that deciphers these characters\r\nwill be an intelligent generation, it will understand and say,\r\n'Not all were asleep in the night of our ancestors!' The mystery of\r\nthese curious characters will save my work from the ignorance of men,\r\njust as the mystery of strange rites has saved many truths from the\r\ndestructive priestly classes.\"\r\n\r\n\"In what language do you write?\" asked Ibarra after a pause.\r\n\r\n\"In our own, Tagalog.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are the hieroglyphical signs suitable?\"\r\n\r\n\"If it were not for the difficulty of drawing them, which takes time\r\nand patience, I would almost say that they are more suitable than the\r\nLatin alphabet. The ancient Egyptian had our vowels; our _o_, which\r\nis only final and is not like that of the Spanish, which is a vowel\r\nbetween _o_ and _u_. Like us, the Egyptians lacked the true sound of\r\n_e_, and in their language are found our _ha_ and _kha_, which we\r\ndo not have in the Latin alphabet such as is used in Spanish. For\r\nexample, in this word _mukha_,\" he went on, pointing to the book,\r\n\"I transcribe the syllable _ha_ more correctly with the figure of\r\na fish than with the Latin _h_, which in Europe is pronounced in\r\ndifferent ways. For a weaker aspirate, as for example in this word\r\n_haín_, where the _h_ has less force, I avail myself of this lion's\r\nhead or of these three lotus flowers, according to the quantity of\r\nthe vowel. Besides, I have the nasal sound which does not exist in\r\nthe Latin-Spanish alphabet. I repeat that if it were not for the\r\ndifficulty of drawing them exactly, these hieroglyphics could almost\r\nbe adopted, but this same difficulty obliges me to be concise and\r\nnot say more than what is exact and necessary. Moreover, this work\r\nkeeps me company when my guests from China and Japan go away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your guests from China and Japan?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you hear them? My guests are the swallows. This year one of\r\nthem is missing--some bad boy in China or Japan must have caught it.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know that they come from those countries?\"\r\n\r\n\"Easily enough! Several years ago, before they left I tied to\r\nthe foot of each one a slip of paper with the name 'Philippines'\r\nin English on it, supposing that they must not travel very far and\r\nbecause English is understood nearly everywhere. For years my slips\r\nbrought no reply, so that at last I had it written in Chinese and here\r\nin the following November they have returned with other notes which\r\nI have had deciphered. One is written in Chinese and is a greeting\r\nfrom the banks of the Hoang-Ho and the other, as the Chinaman whom\r\nI consulted supposes, must be in Japanese. But I'm taking your time\r\nwith these things and haven't asked you what I can do for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've come to speak to you about a matter of importance,\" said the\r\nyouth. \"Yesterday afternoon--\"\r\n\r\n\"Have they caught that poor fellow?\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean Elias? How did you know about him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw the Muse of the Civil Guard!\"\r\n\r\n\"The Muse of the Civil Guard? Who is she?\"\r\n\r\n\"The alferez's woman, whom you didn't invite to your picnic. Yesterday\r\nmorning the incident of the cayman became known through the town. The\r\nMuse of the Civil Guard is as astute as she is malignant and she\r\nguessed that the pilot must be the bold person who threw her husband\r\ninto the mudhole and who assaulted Padre Damaso. As she reads all the\r\nreports that her husband is to receive, scarcely had he got back home,\r\ndrunk and not knowing what he was doing, when to revenge herself on\r\nyou she sent the sergeant with the soldiers to disturb the merriment\r\nof your picnic. Be careful! Eve was a good woman, sprung from the\r\nhands of God--they say that Doña Consolacion is evil and it's not\r\nknown whose hands she came from! In order to be good, a woman needs\r\nto have been, at least sometime, either a maid or a mother.\"\r\n\r\nIbarra smiled slightly and replied by taking some documents from his\r\npocketbook. \"My dead father used to consult you in some things and\r\nI recall that he had only to congratulate himself on following your\r\nadvice. I have on hand a little enterprise, the success of which\r\nI must assure.\" Here he explained briefly his plan for the school,\r\nwhich he had offered to his fiancée, spreading out in view of the\r\nastonished Sage some plans which had been prepared in Manila.\r\n\r\n\"I would like to have you advise me as to what persons in the\r\ntown I must first win over in order to assure the success of the\r\nundertaking. You know the inhabitants well, while I have just arrived\r\nand am almost a stranger in my own country.\"\r\n\r\nOld Tasio examined the plans before him with tear-dimmed eyes. \"What\r\nyou are going to do has been my dream, the dream of a poor lunatic!\" he\r\nexclaimed with emotion. \"And now the first thing that I advise you\r\nto do is never to come to consult with me.\"\r\n\r\nThe youth gazed at him in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Because the sensible people,\" he continued with bitter irony, \"would\r\ntake you for a madman also. The people consider madmen those who do\r\nnot think as they do, so they hold me as such, which I appreciate,\r\nbecause the day in which they think me returned to sanity, they will\r\ndeprive me of the little liberty that I've purchased at the expense\r\nof the reputation of being a sane individual. And who knows but they\r\nare right? I do not live according to their rules, my principles\r\nand ideals are different. The gobernadorcillo enjoys among them the\r\nreputation of being a wise man because he learned nothing more than\r\nto serve chocolate and to put up with Padre Damaso's bad humor, so now\r\nhe is wealthy, he disturbs the petty destinies of his fellow-townsmen,\r\nand at times he even talks of justice. 'That's a man of talent,' think\r\nthe vulgar, 'look how from nothing he has made himself great!' But I,\r\nI inherited fortune and position, I have studied, and now I am poor,\r\nI am not trusted with the most ridiculous office, and all say, 'He's a\r\nfool! He doesn't know how to live!' The curate calls me 'philosopher'\r\nas a nickname and gives to understand that I am a charlatan who is\r\nmaking a show of what I learned in the higher schools, when that is\r\nexactly what benefits me the least. Perhaps I really am the fool and\r\nthey the wise ones--who can say?\"\r\n\r\nThe old man shook his head as if to drive away that thought, and\r\ncontinued: \"The second thing I can advise is that you consult the\r\ncurate, the gobernadorcillo, and all persons in authority. They will\r\ngive you bad, stupid, or useless advice, but consultation doesn't\r\nmean compliance, although you should make it appear that you are\r\ntaking their advice and acting according to it.\"\r\n\r\nIbarra reflected a moment before he replied: \"The advice is good, but\r\ndifficult to follow. Couldn't I go ahead with my idea without a shadow\r\nbeing thrown upon it? Couldn't a worthy enterprise make its way over\r\neverything, since truth doesn't need to borrow garments from error?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nobody loves the naked truth!\" answered the old man. \"That is good\r\nin theory and practicable in the world of which youth dreams. Here is\r\nthe schoolmaster, who has struggled in a vacuum; with the enthusiasm\r\nof a child, he has sought the good, yet he has won only jests and\r\nlaughter. You have said that you are a stranger in your own country,\r\nand I believe it. The very first day you arrived you began by wounding\r\nthe vanity of a priest who is regarded by the people as a saint, and\r\nas a sage among his fellows. God grant that such a misstep may not have\r\nalready determined your future! Because the Dominicans and Augustinians\r\nlook with disdain on the _guingón_ habit, the rope girdle, and the\r\nimmodest foot-wear, because a learned doctor in Santo Tomas [75]\r\nmay have once recalled that Pope Innocent III described the statutes\r\nof that order as more fit for hogs than men, don't believe but that\r\nall of them work hand in hand to affirm what a preacher once said,\r\n'The most insignificant lay brother can do more than the government\r\nwith all its soldiers!' _Cave ne cadas!_ [76] Gold is powerful--the\r\ngolden calf has thrown God down from His altars many times, and that\r\ntoo since the days of Moses!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not so pessimistic nor does life appear to me so perilous in\r\nmy country,\" said Ibarra with a smile. \"I believe that those fears\r\nare somewhat exaggerated and I hope to be able to carry out my plans\r\nwithout meeting any great opposition in that quarter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, if they extend their hands to you; no, if they withhold them. All\r\nyour efforts will be shattered against the walls of the rectory if\r\nthe friar so much as waves his girdle or shakes his habit; tomorrow\r\nthe alcalde will on some pretext deny you what today he has granted;\r\nno mother will allow her son to attend the school, and then all your\r\nlabors will produce a counter-effect--they will dishearten those who\r\nafterwards may wish to attempt altruistic undertakings.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, after all,\" replied the youth, \"I can't believe in that power of\r\nwhich you speak, and even supposing it to exist and making allowance\r\nfor it, I should still have on my side the sensible people and the\r\ngovernment, which is animated by the best intentions, which has great\r\nhopes, and which frankly desires the welfare of the Philippines.\"\r\n\r\n\"The government! The government!\" muttered the Sage, raising his eyes\r\nto stare at the ceiling. \"However inspired it may be with the desire\r\nfor fostering the greatness of the country for the benefit of the\r\ncountry itself and of the mother country, however some official or\r\nother may recall the generous spirit of the Catholic Kings [77] and\r\nmay agree with it, too, the government sees nothing, hears nothing,\r\nnor does it decide anything, except what the curate or the Provincial\r\ncauses it to see, hear, and decide. The government is convinced that it\r\ndepends for its salvation wholly on them, that it is sustained because\r\nthey uphold it, and that the day on which they cease to support it,\r\nit will fall like a manikin that has lost its prop. They intimidate\r\nthe government with an uprising of the people and the people with\r\nthe forces of the government, whence originates a simple game, very\r\nmuch like what happens to timid persons when they visit gloomy places,\r\ntaking for ghosts their own shadows and for strange voices the echoes\r\nof their own. As long as the government does not deal directly with\r\nthe country it will not get away from this tutelage, it will live\r\nlike those imbecile youths who tremble at the voice of their tutor,\r\nwhose kindness they are begging for. The government has no dream of\r\na healthy future; it is the arm, while the head is the convento. By\r\nthis inertia with which it allows itself to be dragged from depth to\r\ndepth, it becomes changed into a shadow, its integrity is impaired,\r\nand in a weak and incapable way it trusts everything to mercenary\r\nhands. But compare our system of government with those of the countries\r\nyou have visited--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" interrupted Ibarra, \"that's asking too much! Let us content\r\nourselves with observing that our people do not complain or suffer as\r\ndo the people of other countries, thanks to Religion and the benignity\r\nof the governing powers.\r\n\r\n\"This people does not complain because it has no voice, it does not\r\nmove because it is lethargic, and you say that it does not suffer\r\nbecause you haven't seen how its heart bleeds. But some day you will\r\nsee this, you will hear its complaints, and then woe unto those who\r\nfound their strength on ignorance and fanaticism! Woe unto those\r\nwho rejoice in deceit and labor during the night, believing that all\r\nare asleep! When the light of day shows up the monsters of darkness,\r\nthe frightful reaction will come. So many sighs suppressed, so much\r\npoison distilled drop by drop, so much force repressed for centuries,\r\nwill come to light and burst! Who then will pay those accounts which\r\noppressed peoples present from time to time and which History preserves\r\nfor us on her bloody pages?\"\r\n\r\n\"God, the government, and Religion will not allow that day to\r\ncome!\" replied Ibarra, impressed in spite of himself. \"The Philippines\r\nis religious and loves Spain, the Philippines will realize how much\r\nthe nation is doing for her. There are abuses, yes, there are defects,\r\nthat cannot be denied, but Spain is laboring to introduce reforms\r\nthat will correct these abuses and defects, she is formulating plans,\r\nshe is not selfish!\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it, and that is the worst of it! The reforms which emanate\r\nfrom the higher places are annulled in the lower circles, thanks to\r\nthe vices of all, thanks, for instance, to the eager desire to get\r\nrich in a short time, and to the ignorance of the people, who consent\r\nto everything. A royal decree does not correct abuses when there is\r\nno zealous authority to watch over its execution, while freedom of\r\nspeech against the insolence of petty tyrants is not conceded. Plans\r\nwill remain plans, abuses will still be abuses, and the satisfied\r\nministry will sleep in peace in spite of everything. Moreover,\r\nif perchance there does come into a high place a person with great\r\nand generous ideas, he will begin to hear, while behind his back he\r\nis considered a fool, 'Your Excellency does not know the country,\r\nyour Excellency does not understand the character of the Indians,\r\nyour Excellency is going to ruin them, your Excellency will do well\r\nto trust So-and-so,' and his Excellency in fact does not know the\r\ncountry, for he has been until now stationed in America, and besides\r\nthat, he has all the shortcomings and weaknesses of other men, so he\r\nallows himself to be convinced. His Excellency also remembers that\r\nto secure the appointment he has had to sweat much and suffer more,\r\nthat he holds it for only three years, that he is getting old and\r\nthat it is necessary to think, not of quixotisms, but of the future:\r\na modest mansion in Madrid, a cozy house in the country, and a good\r\nincome in order to live in luxury at the capital--these are what\r\nhe must look for in the Philippines. Let us not ask for miracles,\r\nlet us not ask that he who comes as an outsider to make his fortune\r\nand go away afterwards should interest himself in the welfare of the\r\ncountry. What matters to him the gratitude or the curses of a people\r\nwhom he does not know, in a country where he has no associations,\r\nwhere he has no affections? Fame to be sweet must resound in the\r\nears of those we love, in the atmosphere of our home or of the land\r\nthat will guard our ashes; we wish that fame should hover over our\r\ntomb to warm with its breath the chill of death, so that we may\r\nnot be completely reduced to nothingness, that something of us may\r\nsurvive. Naught of this can we offer to those who come to watch over\r\nour destinies. And the worst of all this is that they go away just\r\nwhen they are beginning to get an understanding of their duties. But\r\nwe are getting away from our subject.\"\r\n\r\n\"But before getting back to it I must make some things plain,\"\r\ninterrupted the youth eagerly. \"I can admit that the government does\r\nnot know the people, but I believe that the people know the government\r\neven less. There are useless officials, bad ones, if you wish, but\r\nthere are also good ones, and if these are unable to do anything it\r\nis because they meet with an inert mass, the people, who take little\r\npart in the affairs that concern them. But I didn't come to hold a\r\ndiscussion with you on that point, I came to ask for advice and you\r\ntell me to lower my head before grotesque idols!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I repeat it, because here you must either lower your head or\r\nlose it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Either lower my head or lose it!\" repeated Ibarra thoughtfully. \"The\r\ndilemma is hard! But why? Is love for my country incompatible with love\r\nfor Spain? Is it necessary to debase oneself to be a good Christian,\r\nto prostitute one's conscience in order to carry out a good purpose? I\r\nlove my native land, the Philippines, because to it I owe my life and\r\nmy happiness, because every man should love his country. I love Spain,\r\nthe fatherland of my ancestors, because in spite of everything the\r\nPhilippines owes to it, and will continue to owe, her happiness and\r\nher future. I am a Catholic, I preserve pure the faith of my fathers,\r\nand I do not see why I have to lower my head when I can raise it,\r\nto give it over to my enemies when I can humble them!\"\r\n\r\n\"Because the field in which you wish to sow is in possession of your\r\nenemies and against them you are powerless. It is necessary that you\r\nfirst kiss the hand that--\"\r\n\r\nBut the youth let him go no farther, exclaiming passionately, \"Kiss\r\ntheir hands! You forget that among them they killed my father and\r\nthrew his body from the tomb! I who am his son do not forget it,\r\nand that I do not avenge it is because I have regard for the good\r\nname of the Church!\"\r\n\r\nThe old Sage bowed his head as he answered slowly: \"Señor Ibarra, if\r\nyou preserve those memories, which I cannot counsel you to forget,\r\nabandon the enterprise you are undertaking and seek in some other\r\nway the welfare of your countrymen. The enterprise needs another man,\r\nbecause to make it a success zeal and money alone are not sufficient;\r\nin our country are required also self-denial, tenacity of purpose,\r\nand faith, for the soil is not ready, it is only sown with discord.\"\r\n\r\nIbarra appreciated the value of these observations, but still would\r\nnot be discouraged. The thought of Maria Clara was in his mind and\r\nhis promise must be fulfilled.\r\n\r\n\"Doesn't your experience suggest any other than this hard means?\" he\r\nasked in a low voice.\r\n\r\nThe old man took him by the arm and led him to the window. A fresh\r\nbreeze, the precursor of the north wind, was blowing, and before their\r\neyes spread out the garden bounded by the wide forest that was a kind\r\nof park.\r\n\r\n\"Why can we not do as that weak stalk laden with flowers and buds\r\ndoes?\" asked the Sage, pointing to a beautiful jasmine plant. \"The wind\r\nblows and shakes it and it bows its head as if to hide its precious\r\nload. If the stalk should hold itself erect it would be broken,\r\nits flowers would be scattered by the wind, and its buds would be\r\nblighted. The wind passes by and the stalk raises itself erect,\r\nproud of its treasure, yet who will blame it for having bowed before\r\nnecessity? There you see that gigantic _kupang_, which majestically\r\nwaves its light foliage wherein the eagle builds his nest. I brought\r\nit from the forest as a weak sapling and braced its stem for months\r\nwith slender pieces of bamboo. If I had transplanted it large and\r\nfull of life, it is certain that it would not have lived here,\r\nfor the wind would have thrown it down before its roots could have\r\nfixed themselves in the soil, before it could have become accustomed\r\nto its surroundings, and before it could have secured sufficient\r\nnourishment for its size and height. So you, transplanted from Europe\r\nto this stony soil, may end, if you do not seek support and do not\r\nhumble yourself. You are among evil conditions, alone, elevated, the\r\nground shakes, the sky presages a storm, and the top of your family\r\ntree has shown that it draws the thunderbolt. It is not courage, but\r\nfoolhardiness, to fight alone against all that exists. No one censures\r\nthe pilot who makes for a port at the first gust of the whirlwind. To\r\nstoop as the bullet passes is not cowardly--it is worse to defy it\r\nonly to fall, never to rise again.\"\r\n\r\n\"But could this sacrifice produce the fruit that I hope for?\" asked\r\nIbarra. \"Would the priest believe in me and forget the affront? Would\r\nthey aid me frankly in behalf of the education that contests with the\r\nconventos the wealth of the country? Can they not pretend friendship,\r\nmake a show of protection, and yet underneath in the shadows fight it,\r\nundermine it, wound it in the heel, in order to weaken it quicker\r\nthan by attacking it in front? Granted the previous actions which\r\nyou surmise, anything may be expected!\"\r\n\r\nThe old man remained silent from inability to answer these\r\nquestions. After meditating for some time, he said: \"If such should\r\nhappen, if the enterprise should fail, you would be consoled by\r\nthe thought that you had done what was expected of you and thus\r\nsomething would be gained. You would have placed the first stone,\r\nyou would have sown the seed, and after the storm had spent itself\r\nperhaps some grain would have survived the catastrophe to grow and\r\nsave the species from destruction and to serve afterwards as the seed\r\nfor the sons of the dead sower. The example may encourage others who\r\nare only afraid to begin.\"\r\n\r\nWeighing these reasons, Ibarra realized the situation and saw that\r\nwith all the old man's pessimism there was a great deal of truth in\r\nwhat he said.\r\n\r\n\"I believe you!\" he exclaimed, pressing the old man's hand. \"Not in\r\nvain have I looked to you for advice. This very day I'll go and reach\r\nan understanding with the curate, who, after all is said, has done\r\nme no wrong and who must be good, since all of them are not like the\r\npersecutor of my father. I have, besides, to interest him in behalf of\r\nthat unfortunate madwoman and her sons. I put my trust in God and men!\"\r\n\r\nAfter taking leave of the old man he mounted his horse and rode\r\naway. As the pessimistic Sage followed him with his gaze, he muttered:\r\n\"Now let's watch how Destiny will unfold the drama that began in the\r\ncemetery.\" But for once he was greatly mistaken--the drama had begun\r\nlong before!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nThe Eve of the Fiesta\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is now the tenth of November, the eve of the fiesta. Emerging from\r\nits habitual monotony, the town has given itself over to unwonted\r\nactivity in house, church, cockpit, and field. Windows are covered\r\nwith banners and many-hued draperies. All space is filled with noise\r\nand music, and the air is saturated with rejoicings.\r\n\r\nOn little tables with embroidered covers the _dalagas_ arrange in\r\nbright-hued glass dishes different kinds of sweetmeats made from\r\nnative fruits. In the yard the hens cackle, the cocks crow, and the\r\nhogs grunt, all terrified by this merriment of man. Servants move\r\nin and out carrying fancy dishes and silver cutlery. Here there is a\r\nquarrel over a broken plate, there they laugh at the simple country\r\ngirl. Everywhere there is ordering, whispering, shouting. Comments and\r\nconjectures are made, one hurries the other,--all is commotion, noise,\r\nand confusion. All this effort and all this toil are for the stranger\r\nas well as the acquaintance, to entertain every one, whether he has\r\nbeen seen before or not, or whether he is expected to be seen again, in\r\norder that the casual visitor, the foreigner, friend, enemy, Filipino,\r\nSpaniard, the poor and the rich, may go away happy and contented. No\r\ngratitude is even asked of them nor is it expected that they do no\r\ndamage to the hospitable family either during or after digestion! The\r\nrich, those who have ever been to Manila and have seen a little more\r\nthan their neighbors, have bought beer, champagne, liqueurs, wines,\r\nand food-stuffs from Europe, of which they will hardly taste a bite\r\nor drink a drop.\r\n\r\nTheir tables are luxuriously furnished. In the center is a well-modeled\r\nartificial pineapple in which are arranged toothpicks elaborately\r\ncarved by convicts in their rest-hours. Here they have designed a\r\nfan, there a bouquet of flowers, a bird, a rose, a palm leaf, or a\r\nchain, all wrought from a single piece of wood, the artisan being a\r\nforced laborer, the tool a dull knife, and the taskmaster's voice the\r\ninspiration. Around this toothpick-holder are placed glass fruit-trays\r\nfrom which rise pyramids of oranges, lansons, ates, chicos, and even\r\nmangos in spite of the fact that it is November. On wide platters\r\nupon bright-hued sheets of perforated paper are to be seen hams from\r\nEurope and China, stuffed turkeys, and a big pastry in the shape of\r\nan Agnus Dei or a dove, the Holy Ghost perhaps. Among all these are\r\njars of appetizing _acharas_ with fanciful decorations made from\r\nthe flowers of the areca palm and other fruits and vegetables, all\r\ntastefully cut and fastened with sirup to the sides of the flasks.\r\n\r\nGlass lamp globes that have been handed down from father to son are\r\ncleaned, the copper ornaments polished, the kerosene lamps taken out\r\nof the red wrappings which have protected them from the flies and\r\nmosquitoes during the year and which have made them unserviceable;\r\nthe prismatic glass pendants shake to and fro, they clink together\r\nharmoniously in song, and even seem to take part in the fiesta as\r\nthey flash back and break up the rays of light, reflecting them on\r\nthe white walls in all the colors of the rainbow. The children play\r\nabout amusing themselves by chasing the colors, they stumble and break\r\nthe globes, but this does not interfere with the general merriment,\r\nalthough at other times in the year the tears in their round eyes\r\nwould be taken account of in a different way.\r\n\r\nAlong with these venerated lamps there also come forth from their\r\nhiding-places the work of the girls: crocheted scarfs, rugs, artificial\r\nflowers. There appear old glass trays, on the bottoms of which are\r\nsketched miniature lakes with little fishes, caymans, shell-fish,\r\nseaweeds, coral, and glassy stones of brilliant hues. These are heaped\r\nwith cigars, cigarettes, and diminutive buyos prepared by the delicate\r\nfingers of the maidens. The floor of the house shines like a mirror,\r\ncurtains of piña and husi festoon the doorways, from the windows\r\nhang lanterns covered with glass or with paper, pink, blue, green, or\r\nred. The house itself is filled with plants and flower-pots on stands\r\nof Chinese porcelain. Even the saints bedeck themselves, the images\r\nand relics put on a festive air, the dust is brushed from them and\r\non the freshly-washed glass of their cases are hung flowery garlands.\r\n\r\nIn the streets are raised at intervals fanciful bamboo arches, known as\r\n_sinkában_, constructed in various ways and adorned with _kaluskús_,\r\nthe curling bunches of shavings scraped on their sides, at the sight\r\nof which alone the hearts of the children rejoice. About the front\r\nof the church, where the procession is to pass, is a large and costly\r\ncanopy upheld on bamboo posts. Beneath this the children run and play,\r\nclimbing, jumping, and tearing the new camisas in which they should\r\nshine on the principal day of the fiesta.\r\n\r\nThere on the plaza a platform has been erected, the scenery being\r\nof bamboo, nipa, and wood; there the Tondo comedians will perform\r\nwonders and compete with the gods in improbable miracles, there\r\nwill sing and dance Marianito, Chananay, Balbino, Ratia, Carvajal,\r\nYeyeng, Liceria, etc. The Filipino enjoys the theater and is a deeply\r\ninterested spectator of dramatic representations, but he listens in\r\nsilence to the song, he gazes delighted at the dancing and mimicry,\r\nhe never hisses or applauds.\r\n\r\nIf the show is not to his liking, he chews his buyo or withdraws\r\nwithout disturbing the others who perhaps find pleasure in it. Only\r\nat times the commoner sort will howl when the actors embrace or kiss\r\nthe actresses, but they never go beyond that. Formerly, dramas only\r\nwere played; the local poet composed a piece in which there must\r\nnecessarily be a fight every second minute, a clown, and terrifying\r\ntransformations. But since the Tondo artist have begun to fight every\r\nfifteen seconds, with two clowns, and even greater marvels than before,\r\nthey have put to rout their provincial compeers. The gobernadorcillo\r\nwas very fond of this sort of thing, so, with the approval of the\r\ncurate, he chose a spectacle with magic and fireworks, entitled, \"The\r\nPrince Villardo or the Captives Rescued from the Infamous Cave.\" [78]\r\n\r\nFrom time to time the bells chime out merrily, those same bells that\r\nten days ago were tolling so mournfully. Pin-wheels and mortars rend\r\nthe air, for the Filipino pyrotechnist, who learned the art from\r\nno known instructor, displays his ability by preparing fire bulls,\r\ncastles of Bengal lights, paper balloons inflated with hot air, bombs,\r\nrockets, and the like.\r\n\r\nNow distant strains of music are heard and the small boys rush headlong\r\ntoward the outskirts of the town to meet the bands of music, five\r\nof which have been engaged, as well as three orchestras. The band of\r\nPagsanhan belonging to the escribano must not be lacking nor that of\r\nSan Pedro de Tunasan, at that time famous because it was directed by\r\nthe maestro Austria, the vagabond \"Corporal Mariano\" who, according to\r\nreport, carried fame and harmony in the tip of his baton. Musicians\r\npraise his funeral march, \"El Sauce,\" [79] and deplore his lack of\r\nmusical education, since with his genius he might have brought glory\r\nto his country. The bands enter the town playing lively airs, followed\r\nby ragged or half-naked urchins, one in the camisa of his brother,\r\nanother in his father's pantaloons. As soon as the band ceases, the\r\nboys know the piece by heart, they hum and whistle it with rare skill,\r\nthey pronounce their judgment upon it.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, there are arriving in conveyances of all kinds relatives,\r\nfriends, strangers, the gamblers with their best game-cocks and their\r\nbags of gold, ready to risk their fortune on the green cloth or within\r\nthe arena of the cockpit.\r\n\r\n\"The alferez has fifty pesos for each night,\" murmurs a small,\r\nchubby individual into the ears of the latest arrivals. \"Capitan\r\nTiago's coming and will set up a bank; Capitan Joaquin's bringing\r\neighteen thousand. There'll be _liam-pó_: Carlos the Chinaman will\r\nset it up with ten thousand. Big stakes are coming from Tanawan, Lipa,\r\nand Batangas, as well as from Santa Cruz. [80] It's going to be on a\r\nbig scale, yes, sir, on a grand scale! But have some chocolate! This\r\nyear Capitan Tiago won't break us as he did last, since he's paid\r\nfor only three thanksgiving masses and I've got a cacao _mutyâ_. And\r\nhow's your family?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, thank you,\" the visitors respond, \"and Padre Damaso?\"\r\n\r\n\"Padre Damaso will preach in the morning and sit in with us at night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good enough! Then there's no danger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure, we're sure! Carlos the Chinaman will loosen up also.\" Here\r\nthe chubby individual works his fingers as though counting out pieces\r\nof money.\r\n\r\nOutside the town the hill-folk, the _kasamá_, are putting on their\r\nbest clothes to carry to the houses of their landlords well-fattened\r\nchickens, wild pigs, deer, and birds. Some load firewood on the heavy\r\ncarts, others fruits, ferns, and orchids, the rarest that grow in\r\nthe forests, others bring broad-leafed caladiums and flame-colored\r\n_tikas-tikas_ blossoms to decorate the doors of the houses.\r\n\r\nBut the place where the greatest activity reigns, where it is converted\r\ninto a tumult, is there on a little plot of raised ground, a few\r\nsteps from Ibarra's house. Pulleys screech and yells are heard amid\r\nthe metallic sound of iron striking upon stone, hammers upon nails,\r\nof axes chopping out posts. A crowd of laborers is digging in the\r\nearth to open a wide, deep trench, while others place in line the\r\nstones taken from the town quarries. Carts are unloaded, piles of\r\nsand are heaped up, windlasses and derricks are set in place.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, you there! Hurry up!\" cries a little old man with lively and\r\nintelligent features, who has for a cane a copper-bound rule around\r\nwhich is wound the cord of a plumb-bob. This is the foreman of the\r\nwork, Ñor Juan, architect, mason, carpenter, painter, locksmith,\r\nstonecutter, and, on occasions, sculptor. \"It must be finished right\r\nnow! Tomorrow there'll be no work and the day after tomorrow is the\r\nceremony. Hurry!\"\r\n\r\n\"Cut that hole so that this cylinder will fit it exactly,\" he says\r\nto some masons who are shaping a large square block of stone. \"Within\r\nthat our names will be preserved.\"\r\n\r\nHe repeats to every newcomer who approaches the place what he\r\nhas already said a thousand times: \"You know what we're going to\r\nbuild? Well, it's a schoolhouse, a model of its kind, like those in\r\nGermany, and even better. A great architect has drawn the plans,\r\nand I--I am bossing the job! Yes, sir, look at it, it's going to\r\nbe a palace with two wings, one for the boys and the other for the\r\ngirls. Here in the middle a big garden with three fountains, there on\r\nthe sides shaded walks with little plots for the children to sow and\r\ncultivate plants in during their recess-time, that they may improve\r\nthe hours and not waste them. Look how deep the foundations are,\r\nthree meters and seventy-five centimeters! This building is going\r\nto have storerooms, cellars, and for those who are not diligent\r\nstudents dungeons near the playgrounds so that the culprits may hear\r\nhow the studious children are enjoying themselves. Do you see that\r\nbig space? That will be a lawn for running and exercising in the\r\nopen air. The little girls will have a garden with benches, swings,\r\nwalks where they can jump the rope, fountains, bird-cages, and so\r\non. It's going to be magnificent!\"\r\n\r\nThen Ñor Juan would rub his hands together as he thought of the\r\nfame that he was going to acquire. Strangers would come to see it\r\nand would ask, \"Who was the great artisan that built this?\" and all\r\nwould answer, \"Don't you know? Can it be that you've never heard\r\nof Ñor Juan? Undoubtedly you've come from a great distance!\" With\r\nthese thoughts he moved from one part to the other, examining and\r\nreexamining everything.\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me that there's too much timber for one derrick,\" he\r\nremarked to a yellowish man who was overseeing some laborers. \"I\r\nshould have enough with three large beams for the tripod and three\r\nmore for the braces.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind!\" answered the yellowish man, smiling in a peculiar\r\nway. \"The more apparatus we use in the work, so much the greater effect\r\nwe'll get. The whole thing will look better and of more importance,\r\nso they'll say, 'How hard they've worked!' You'll see, you'll see\r\nwhat a derrick I'll put up! Then I'll decorate it with banners, and\r\ngarlands of leaves and flowers. You'll say afterwards that you were\r\nright in hiring me as one of your laborers, and Señor Ibarra couldn't\r\nask for more!\" As he said this the man laughed and smiled. Ñor Juan\r\nalso smiled, but shook his head.\r\n\r\nSome distance away were seen two kiosks united by a kind of arbor\r\ncovered with banana leaves. The schoolmaster and some thirty boys\r\nwere weaving crowns and fastening banners upon the frail bamboo posts,\r\nwhich were wrapped in white cloth.\r\n\r\n\"Take care that the letters are well written,\" he admonished the boys\r\nwho were preparing inscriptions. \"The alcalde is coming, many curates\r\nwill be present, perhaps even the Captain-General, who is now in the\r\nprovince. If they see that you draw well, maybe they'll praise you.\"\r\n\r\n\"And give us a blackboard?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps, but Señor Ibarra has already ordered one from\r\nManila. Tomorrow some things will come to be distributed among you\r\nas prizes. Leave those flowers in the water and tomorrow we'll make\r\nthe bouquets. Bring more flowers, for it's necessary that the table\r\nbe covered with them--flowers please the eye.\"\r\n\r\n\"My father will bring some water-lilies and a basket of sampaguitas\r\ntomorrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mine has brought three cartloads of sand without pay.\"\r\n\r\n\"My uncle has promised to pay a teacher,\" added a nephew of Capitan\r\nBasilio.\r\n\r\nTruly, the project was receiving help from all. The curate had asked to\r\nstand sponsor for it and himself bless the laying of the corner-stone,\r\na ceremony to take place on the last day of the fiesta as one of its\r\ngreatest solemnities. The very coadjutor had timidly approached Ibarra\r\nwith an offer of all the fees for masses that the devout would pay\r\nuntil the building was finished. Even more, the rich and economical\r\nSister Rufa had declared that if money should be lacking she would\r\ncanvass other towns and beg for alms, with the mere condition that she\r\nbe paid her expenses for travel and subsistence. Ibarra thanked them\r\nall, as he answered, \"We aren't going to have anything very great,\r\nsince I am not rich and this building is not a church. Besides,\r\nI didn't undertake to erect it at the expense of others.\"\r\n\r\nThe younger men, students from Manila, who had come to take part\r\nin the fiesta, gazed at him in admiration and took him for a model;\r\nbut, as it nearly always happens, when we wish to imitate great men,\r\nthat we copy only their foibles and even their defects, since we are\r\ncapable of nothing else, so many of these admirers took note of the\r\nway in which he tied his cravat, others of the style of his collar,\r\nand not a few of the number of buttons on his coat and vest.\r\n\r\nThe funereal presentiments of old Tasio seemed to have been dissipated\r\nforever. So Ibarra observed to him one day, but the old pessimist\r\nanswered: \"Remember what Baltazar says:\r\n\r\n\r\n        Kung ang isalúbong sa iyong pagdating\r\n        Ay masayang maukha't may pakitang giliw,\r\n        Lalong pag-iñgata't kaaway na lihim [81]--\r\n\r\n\r\nBaltazar was no less a thinker than a poet.\"\r\n\r\nThus in the gathering shadows before the setting of the sun events\r\nwere shaping themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nIn the Twilight\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Capitan Tiago's house also great preparations had been made. We\r\nknow its owner, whose love of ostentation and whose pride as a\r\nManilan imposed the necessity of humiliating the provincials with his\r\nsplendor. Another reason, too, made it his duty to eclipse all others:\r\nhe had his daughter Maria Clara with him, and there was present his\r\nfuture son-in-law, who was attracting universal attention.\r\n\r\nIn fact one of the most serious newspapers in Manila had devoted to\r\nIbarra an article on its front page, entitled, \"Imitate him!\" heaping\r\nhim with praise and giving him some advice. It had called him, \"The\r\ncultivated young gentleman and rich capitalist;\" two lines further\r\non, \"The distinguished philanthropist;\" in the following paragraph,\r\n\"The disciple of Minerva who had gone to the mother country to\r\npay his respects to the true home of the arts and sciences;\" and\r\na little further on, \"The Filipino Spaniard.\" Capitan Tiago burned\r\nwith generous zeal to imitate him and wondered whether he ought not\r\nto erect a convento at his own expense.\r\n\r\nSome days before there had arrived at the house where Maria Clara\r\nand Aunt Isabel were staying a profusion of eases of European wines\r\nand food-stuffs, colossal mirrors, paintings, and Maria Clara's\r\npiano. Capitan Tiago had arrived on the day before the fiesta and as\r\nhis daughter kissed his hand, had presented her with a beautiful locket\r\nset with diamonds and emeralds, containing a sliver from St. Peter's\r\nboat, in which Our Savior sat during the fishing. His first interview\r\nwith his future son-in-law could not have been more cordial. Naturally,\r\nthey talked about the school, and Capitan Tiago wanted it named\r\n\"School of St. Francis.\" \"Believe me,\" he said, \"St. Francis is a good\r\npatron. If you call it 'School of Primary Instruction,' you will gain\r\nnothing. Who is Primary Instruction, anyhow?\"\r\n\r\nSome friends of Maria Clara came and asked her to go for a walk. \"But\r\ncome back quickly,\" said Capitan Tiago to his daughter, when she asked\r\nhis permission, \"for you know that Padre Damaso, who has just arrived,\r\nwill dine with us.\"\r\n\r\nThen turning to Ibarra, who had become thoughtful, he said, \"You dine\r\nwith us also, you'll be all alone in your house.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would with the greatest pleasure, but I have to be at home in\r\ncase visitors come,\" stammered the youth, as he avoided the gaze of\r\nMaria Clara.\r\n\r\n\"Bring your friends along,\" replied Capitan Tiago heartily. \"In my\r\nhouse there's always plenty to eat. Also, I want you and Padre Damaso\r\nto get on good terms.\"\r\n\r\n\"There'll be time enough for that,\" answered Ibarra with a forced\r\nsmile, as he prepared to accompany the girls.\r\n\r\nThey went downstairs, Maria Clara in the center between Victoria\r\nand Iday, Aunt Isabel following. The people made way for them\r\nrespectfully. Maria Clara was startling in her beauty; her pallor\r\nwas all gone, and if her eyes were still pensive, her mouth on the\r\ncontrary seemed to know only smiles. With maiden friendliness the\r\nhappy young woman greeted the acquaintances of her childhood, now\r\nthe admirers of her promising youth. In less than a fortnight she had\r\nsucceeded in recovering that frank confidence, that childish prattle,\r\nwhich seemed to have been benumbed between the narrow walls of the\r\nnunnery. It might be said that on leaving the cocoon the butterfly\r\nrecognized all the flowers, for it seemed to be enough for her to\r\nspread her wings for a moment and warm herself in the sun's rays to\r\nlose all the stiffness of the chrysalis. This new life manifested\r\nitself in her whole nature. Everything she found good and beautiful,\r\nand she showed her love with that maiden modesty which, having never\r\nbeen conscious of any but pure thoughts, knows not the meaning of false\r\nblushes. While she would cover her face when she was teased, still her\r\neyes smiled, and a light thrill would course through her whole being.\r\n\r\nThe houses were beginning to show lights, and in the streets where\r\nthe music was moving about there were lighted torches of bamboo and\r\nwood made in imitation of those in the church. From the streets\r\nthe people in the houses might be seen through the windows in an\r\natmosphere of music and flowers, moving about to the sounds of piano,\r\nharp, or orchestra. Swarming in the streets were Chinese, Spaniards,\r\nFilipinos, some dressed in European style, some in the costumes\r\nof the country. Crowding, elbowing, and pushing one another, walked\r\nservants carrying meat and chickens, students in white, men and women,\r\nall exposing themselves to be knocked down by the carriages which,\r\nin spite of the drivers' cries, made their way with difficulty.\r\n\r\nIn front of Capitan Basilio's house some young women called to our\r\nacquaintances and invited them to enter. The merry voice of Sinang as\r\nshe ran down the stairs put an end to all excuses. \"Come up a moment\r\nso that I may go with you,\" she said. \"I'm bored staying here among\r\nso many strangers who talk only of game-cocks and cards.\"\r\n\r\nThey were ushered into a large room filled with people, some of whom\r\ncame forward to greet Ibarra, for his name was now well known. All\r\ngazed in ecstasy at the beauty of Maria Clara and some old women\r\nmurmured, as they chewed their buyo, \"She looks like the Virgin!\"\r\n\r\nThere they had to have chocolate, as Capitan Basilio had become a warm\r\nfriend and defender of Ibarra since the day of the picnic. He had\r\nlearned from the half of the telegram given to his daughter Sinang\r\nthat Ibarra had known beforehand about the court's decision in the\r\nlatter's favor, so, not wishing to be outdone in generosity, he had\r\ntried to set aside the decision of the chess-match. But when Ibarra\r\nwould not consent to this, he had proposed that the money which would\r\nhave been spent in court fees should be used to pay a teacher in the\r\nnew school. In consequence, the orator employed all his eloquence to\r\nthe end that other litigants should give up their extravagant claims,\r\nsaying to them, \"Believe me, in a lawsuit the winner is left without\r\na camisa.\" But he had succeeded in convincing no one, even though he\r\ncited the Romans.\r\n\r\nAfter drinking the chocolate our young people had to listen to\r\npiano-playing by the town organist. \"When I listen to him in the\r\nchurch,\" exclaimed Sinang, pointing to the organist, \"I want to dance,\r\nand now that he's playing here I feel like praying, so I'm going out\r\nwith you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you want to join us tonight?\" whispered Capitan Basilio into\r\nIbarra's ear as they were leaving. \"Padre Damaso is going to set up\r\na little bank.\" Ibarra smiled and answered with an equivocal shake\r\nof his head.\r\n\r\n\"Who's that?\" asked Maria Clara of Victoria, indicating with a rapid\r\nglance a youth who was following them.\r\n\r\n\"He's--he's a cousin of mine,\" she answered with some agitation.\r\n\r\n\"And the other?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's no cousin of mine,\" put in Sinang merrily. \"He's my uncle's son.\"\r\n\r\nThey passed in front of the parish rectory, which was not one of the\r\nleast animated buildings. Sinang was unable to repress an exclamation\r\nof surprise on seeing the lamps burning, those lamps of antique\r\npattern which Padre Salvi had never allowed to be lighted, in order\r\nnot to waste kerosene. Loud talk and resounding bursts of laughter\r\nmight be heard as the friars moved slowly about, nodding their heads\r\nin unison with the big cigars that adorned their lips. The laymen\r\nwith them, who from their European garments appeared to be officials\r\nand employees of the province, were endeavoring to imitate whatever\r\nthe good priests did. Maria Clara made out the rotund figure of Padre\r\nDamaso at the side of the trim silhouette of Padre Sibyla. Motionless\r\nin his place stood the silent and mysterious Fray Salvi.\r\n\r\n\"He's sad,\" observed Sinang, \"for he's thinking about how much so\r\nmany visitors are going to cost. But you'll see how he'll not pay\r\nit himself, but the sacristans will. His visitors always eat at\r\nother places.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sinang!\" scolded Victoria.\r\n\r\n\"I haven't been able to endure him since he tore up the _Wheel of\r\nFortune_. I don't go to confession to him any more.\"\r\n\r\nOf all the houses one only was to be noticed without lights and with\r\nall the windows closed--that of the alferez. Maria Clara expressed\r\nsurprise at this.\r\n\r\n\"The witch! The Muse of the Civil Guard, as the old man says,\"\r\nexclaimed the irrepressible Sinang. \"What has she to do with our\r\nmerrymakings? I imagine she's raging! But just let the cholera come\r\nand you'd see her give a banquet.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Sinang!\" again her cousin scolded.\r\n\r\n\"I never was able to endure her and especially since she disturbed our\r\npicnic with her civil-guards. If I were the Archbishop I'd marry Her\r\nto Padre Salvi--then think what children! Look how she tried to arrest\r\nthe poor pilot, who threw himself into the water simply to please--\"\r\n\r\nShe was not allowed to finish, for in the corner of the plaza\r\nwhere a blind man was singing to the accompaniment of a guitar,\r\na curious spectacle was presented. It was a man miserably dressed,\r\nwearing a broad salakot of palm leaves. His clothing consisted of a\r\nragged coat and wide pantaloons, like those worn by the Chinese, torn\r\nin many places. Wretched sandals covered his feet. His countenance\r\nremained hidden in the shadow of his wide hat, but from this shadow\r\nthere flashed intermittently two burning rays. Placing a flat basket\r\non the ground, he would withdraw a few paces and utter strange,\r\nincomprehensible sounds, remaining the while standing entirely alone as\r\nif he and the crowd were mutually avoiding each other. Then some women\r\nwould approach the basket and put into it fruit, fish, or rice. When\r\nno one any longer approached, from the shadows would issue sadder\r\nbut less pitiful sounds, cries of gratitude perhaps. Then he would\r\ntake up the basket and make his way to another place to repeat the\r\nsame performance.\r\n\r\nMaria Clara divined that there must be some misfortune there, and\r\nfull of interest she asked concerning the strange creature.\r\n\r\n\"He's a leper,\" Iday told her. \"Four years ago he contracted the\r\ndisease, some say from taking care of his mother, others from lying\r\nin a damp prison. He lives in the fields near the Chinese cemetery,\r\nhaving intercourse with no one, because all flee from him for fear of\r\ncontagion. If you might only see his home! It's a tumbledown shack,\r\nthrough which the wind and rain pass like a needle through cloth. He\r\nhas been forbidden to touch anything belonging to the people. One day\r\nwhen a little child fell into a shallow ditch as he was passing,\r\nhe helped to get it out. The child's father complained to the\r\ngobernadorcillo, who ordered that the leper be flogged through the\r\nstreets and that the rattan be burned afterwards. It was horrible! The\r\nleper fled with his flogger in pursuit, while the gobernadorcillo\r\ncried, 'Catch him! Better be drowned than get the disease you have!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Can it be true!\" murmured Maria Clara, then, without saying what she\r\nwas about to do, went up to the wretch's basket and dropped into it\r\nthe locket her father had given her.\r\n\r\n\"What have you done?\" her friends asked.\r\n\r\n\"I hadn't anything else,\" she answered, trying to conceal her tears\r\nwith a smile.\r\n\r\n\"What is he going to do with your locket?\" Victoria asked her. \"One\r\nday they gave him some money, but he pushed it away with a stick;\r\nwhy should he want it when no one accepts anything that comes from\r\nhim? As if the locket could be eaten!\"\r\n\r\nMaria Clara gazed enviously at the women who were selling food-stuffs\r\nand shrugged her shoulders. The leper approached the basket, picked\r\nup the jeweled locket, which glittered in his hands, then fell upon\r\nhis knees, kissed it, and taking off his salakot buried his forehead\r\nin the dust where the maiden had stepped. Maria Clara hid her face\r\nbehind her fan and raised her handkerchief to her eyes.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, a poor woman had approached the leper, who seemed to be\r\npraying. Her long hair was loose and unkempt, and in the light of\r\nthe torches could be recognized the extremely emaciated features of\r\nthe crazy Sisa. Feeling the touch of her hand, the leper jumped up\r\nwith a cry, but to the horror of the onlooker's Sisa caught him by\r\nthe arm and said:\r\n\r\n\"Let us pray, let us pray! Today is All Souls' day! Those lights are\r\nthe souls of men! Let us pray for my sons!\"\r\n\r\n\"Separate them! Separate them! The madwoman will get the\r\ndisease!\" cried the crowd, but no one dared to go near them.\r\n\r\n\"Do you see that light in the tower? That is my son Basilio sliding\r\ndown a rope! Do you see that light in the convento? That is my son\r\nCrispin! But I'm not going to see them because the curate is sick\r\nand had many gold pieces and the gold pieces are lost! Pray, let us\r\npray for the soul of the curate! I took him the finest fruits, for\r\nmy garden was full of flowers and I had two sons! I had a garden,\r\nI used to take care of my flowers, and I had two sons!\"\r\n\r\nThen releasing her hold of the leper, she ran away singing, \"I had\r\na garden and flowers, I had two sons, a garden, and flowers!\"\r\n\r\n\"What have you been able to do for that poor woman?\" Maria Clara\r\nasked Ibarra.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing! Lately she has been missing from the totem and wasn't to\r\nbe found,\" answered the youth, rather confusedly. \"Besides, I have\r\nbeen very busy. But don't let it trouble you. The curate has promised\r\nto help me, but advised that I proceed with great tact and caution,\r\nfor the Civil Guard seems to be mixed up in it. The curate is greatly\r\ninterested in her case.\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't the alferez say that he would have search made for her sons?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but at the time he was somewhat--drunk.\" Scarcely had he said\r\nthis when they saw the crazy woman being led, or rather dragged along,\r\nby a soldier. Sisa was offering resistance.\r\n\r\n\"Why are you arresting her? What has she done?\" asked Ibarra.\r\n\r\n\"Why, haven't you seen how she's been raising a disturbance?\" was\r\nthe reply of the guardian of the public peace.\r\n\r\nThe leper caught up his basket hurriedly and ran away.\r\n\r\nMaria Clara wanted to go home, as she had lost all her mirth and good\r\nhumor. \"So there are people who are not happy,\" she murmured. Arriving\r\nat her door, she felt her sadness increase when her fiancé declined\r\nto go in, excusing himself on the plea of necessity. Maria Clara went\r\nupstairs thinking what a bore are the fiesta days, when strangers\r\nmake their visits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nCorrespondence\r\n\r\n\t\t\tCada uno habla de la feria como le va en ella. [82]\r\n\r\n\r\nAs nothing of importance to our characters happened during the\r\nfirst two days, we should gladly pass on to the third and last,\r\nwere it not that perhaps some foreign reader may wish to know how the\r\nFilipinos celebrate their fiestas. For this reason we shall faithfully\r\nreproduce in this chapter several letters, one of them being that\r\nof the correspondent of a noted Manila newspaper, respected for its\r\ngrave tone and deep seriousness. Our readers will correct some natural\r\nand trifling slips of the pen. Thus the worthy correspondent of the\r\nrespectable newspaper wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"TO THE EDITOR, MY DISTINGUISHED FRIEND,--Never did I witness,\r\n    nor had I ever expected to see in the provinces, a religious\r\n    fiesta so solemn, so splendid, and so impressive as that\r\n    now being celebrated in this town by the Most Reverend and\r\n    virtuous Franciscan Fathers.\r\n\r\n    \"Great crowds are in attendance. I have here had the pleasure\r\n    of greeting nearly all the Spaniards who reside in this\r\n    province, three Reverend Augustinian Fathers from the province\r\n    of Batangas, and two Reverend Dominican Fathers. One of the\r\n    latter is the Very Reverend Fray Hernando Sibyla, who has come\r\n    to honor this town with his presence, a distinction which its\r\n    worthy inhabitants should never forget. I have also seen a\r\n    great number of the best people of Cavite and Pampanga, many\r\n    wealthy persons from Manila, and many bands of music,--among\r\n    these the very artistic one of Pagsanhan belonging to\r\n    the escribano, Don Miguel Guevara,--swarms of Chinamen and\r\n    Indians, who, with the curiosity of the former and the piety\r\n    of the latter, awaited anxiously the day on which was to be\r\n    celebrated the comic-mimic-lyric-lightning-change-dramatic\r\n    spectacle, for which a large and spacious theater had been\r\n    erected in the middle of the plaza.\r\n\r\n    \"At nine on the night of the 10th, the eve of the fiesta,\r\n    after a succulent dinner set before us by the _hermano mayor_,\r\n    the attention of all the Spaniards and friars in the convento\r\n    was attracted by strains of music from a surging multitude\r\n    which, with the noise of bombs and rockets, preceded by\r\n    the leading citizens of the town, came to the convento to\r\n    escort us to the place prepared and arranged for us that we\r\n    might witness the spectacle. Such a courteous offer we had to\r\n    accept, although I should have preferred to rest in the arms\r\n    of Morpheus and repose my weary limbs, which were aching,\r\n    thanks to the joltings of the vehicle furnished us by the\r\n    gobernadorcillo of B----.\r\n\r\n    \"Accordingly we joined them and proceeded to look for our\r\n    companions, who were dining in the house, owned here by the\r\n    pious and wealthy Don Santiago de los Santos. The curate of\r\n    the town, the Very Reverend Fray Bernardo Salvi, and the Very\r\n    Reverend Fray Damaso Verdolagas, who is now by the special\r\n    favor of Heaven recovered from the suffering caused him by\r\n    an impious hand, in company with the Very Reverend Fray\r\n    Hernando Sibyla and the virtuous curate of Tanawan, with\r\n    other Spaniards, were guests in the house of the Filipino\r\n    Croesus. There we had the good fortune of admiring not only\r\n    the luxury and good taste of the host, which are not usual\r\n    among the natives, but also the beauty of the charming\r\n    and wealthy heiress, who showed herself to be a polished\r\n    disciple of St. Cecelia by playing on her elegant piano,\r\n    with a mastery that recalled Galvez to me, the best German\r\n    and Italian compositions. It is a matter of regret that such\r\n    a charming young lady should be so excessively modest as to\r\n    hide her talents from a society which has only admiration\r\n    for her. Nor should I leave unwritten that in the house\r\n    of our host there were set before us champagne and fine\r\n    liqueurs with the profusion and splendor that characterize\r\n    the well-known capitalist.\r\n\r\n    \"We attended the spectacle. You already know our artists,\r\n    Ratia, Carvajal, and Fernandez, whose cleverness was\r\n    comprehended by us alone, since the uncultured crowd did\r\n    not understand a jot of it. Chananay and Balbino were very\r\n    good, though a little hoarse; the latter made one break,\r\n    but together, and as regards earnest effort, they were\r\n    admirable. The Indians were greatly pleased with the Tagalog\r\n    drama, especially the gobernadorcillo, who rubbed his hands\r\n    and informed us that it was a pity that they had not made the\r\n    princess join in combat with the giant who had stolen her\r\n    away, which in his opinion would have been more marvelous,\r\n    especially if the giant had been represented as vulnerable\r\n    only in the navel, like a certain Ferragus of whom the stories\r\n    of the Paladins tell. The Very Reverend Fray Damaso, in his\r\n    customary goodness of heart, concurred in this opinion, and\r\n    added that in such case the princess should be made to discover\r\n    the giant's weak spot and give him the _coup de grace_.\r\n\r\n    \"Needless to tell you that during the show the affability\r\n    of the Filipino Rothschild allowed nothing to be lacking:\r\n    ice-cream, lemonade, wines, and refreshments of all kinds\r\n    circulated profusely among us. A matter of reasonable and\r\n    special note was the absence of the well-known and cultured\r\n    youth, Don Juan Crisostomo Ibarra, who, as you know, will\r\n    tomorrow preside at the laying of the corner-stone for the\r\n    great edifice which he is so philanthropically erecting. This\r\n    worthy descendant of the Pelayos and Elcanos (for I have\r\n    learned that one of his paternal ancestors was from our heroic\r\n    and noble northern provinces, perhaps one of the companions\r\n    of Magellan or Legazpi) did not show himself during the\r\n    entire day, owing to a slight indisposition. His name runs\r\n    from mouth to mouth, being uttered with praises that can only\r\n    reflect glory upon Spain and true Spaniards like ourselves,\r\n    who never deny our blood, however mixed it may be.\r\n\r\n    \"Today, at eleven o'clock in the morning, we attended a\r\n    deeply-moving spectacle. Today, as is generally known, is\r\n    the fiesta of the Virgin of Peace and is being observed by\r\n    the Brethren of the Holy Rosary. Tomorrow will occur the\r\n    fiesta of the patron, San Diego, and it will be observed\r\n    principally by the Venerable Tertiary Order. Between these\r\n    two societies there exists a pious rivalry in serving God,\r\n    which piety has reached the extreme of holy quarrels among\r\n    them, as has just happened in the dispute over the preacher of\r\n    acknowledged fame, the oft-mentioned Very Reverend Fray Damaso,\r\n    who tomorrow will occupy the pulpit of the Holy Ghost with\r\n    a sermon, which, according to general expectation, will be\r\n    a literary and religious event.\r\n\r\n    \"So, _as we were saying_, we attended a highly edifying\r\n    and moving spectacle. Six pious youths, three to recite the\r\n    mass and three for acolytes, marched out of the sacristy and\r\n    prostrated themselves before the altar, while the officiating\r\n    priest, the Very Reverend Fray Hernando Sibyla, chanted the\r\n    _Surge Domine_--the signal for commencing the procession\r\n    around the church--with the magnificent voice and religious\r\n    unction that all recognize and that make him so worthy of\r\n    general admiration. When the _Surge Domine_ was concluded,\r\n    the gobernadorcillo, in a frock coat, carrying the standard\r\n    and followed by four acolytes with incense-burners, headed\r\n    the procession. Behind them came the tall silver candelabra,\r\n    the municipal corporation, the precious images dressed in satin\r\n    and gold, representing St. Dominic and the Virgin of Peace in a\r\n    magnificent blue robe trimmed with gilded silver, the gift of\r\n    the pious ex-gobernadorcillo, the so-worthy-of-being-imitated\r\n    and never-sufficiently-praised Don Santiago de los Santos. All\r\n    these images were borne on silver cars. Behind the Mother of\r\n    God came the Spaniards and the rest of the clergy, while the\r\n    officiating priest was protected by a canopy carried by the\r\n    cabezas de barangay, and the procession was closed by a squad\r\n    of the worthy Civil Guard. I believe it unnecessary to state\r\n    that a multitude of Indians, carrying lighted candles with\r\n    great devotion, formed the two lines of the procession. The\r\n    musicians played religious marches, while bombs and pinwheels\r\n    furnished repeated salutes. It causes admiration to see the\r\n    modesty and the fervor which these ceremonies inspire in the\r\n    hearts of the true believers, the grand, pure faith professed\r\n    for the Virgin of Peace, the solemnity and fervent devotion\r\n    with which such ceremonies are performed by those of us who\r\n    have had the good fortune to be born under the sacrosanct\r\n    and immaculate banner of Spain.\r\n\r\n    \"The procession concluded, there began the mass rendered by\r\n    the orchestra and the theatrical artists. After the reading\r\n    of the Gospel, the Very Reverend Fray Manuel Martin, an\r\n    Augustinian from the province of Batangas, ascended the\r\n    pulpit and kept the whole audience enraptured and hanging\r\n    on his words, especially the Spaniards, during the exordium\r\n    in Castilian, as he spoke with vigor and in such flowing\r\n    and well-rounded periods that our hearts were filled with\r\n    fervor and enthusiasm. This indeed is the term that should\r\n    be used for what is felt, or what we feel, when the Virgin\r\n    of our beloved Spain is considered, and above all when there\r\n    can be intercalated in the text, if the subject permits,\r\n    the ideas of a prince of the Church, the _Señor Monescillo_,\r\n    [83] which are surely those of all Spaniards.\r\n\r\n    \"At the conclusion of the services all of us went up into\r\n    the convento with the leading citizens of the town and other\r\n    persons of note. There we were especially honored by the\r\n    refinement, attention, and prodigality that characterize the\r\n    Very Reverend Fray Salvi, there being set before us cigars\r\n    and an abundant lunch which the _hermano mayor_ had prepared\r\n    under the convento for all who might feel the necessity for\r\n    appeasing the cravings of their stomachs.\r\n\r\n    \"During the day nothing has been lacking to make the fiesta\r\n    joyous and to preserve the animation so characteristic of\r\n    Spaniards, and which it is impossible to restrain on such\r\n    occasions as this, showing itself sometimes in singing and\r\n    dancing, at other times in simple and merry diversions of\r\n    so strong and noble a nature that all sorrow is driven away,\r\n    and it is enough for three Spaniards to be gathered together\r\n    in one place in order that sadness and ill-humor be banished\r\n    thence. Then homage was paid to Terpsichore in many homes,\r\n    but especially in that of the cultured Filipino millionaire,\r\n    where we were all invited to dine. Needless to say, the\r\n    banquet, which was sumptuous and elegantly served, was a\r\n    second edition of the wedding-feast in Cana, or of Camacho,\r\n    [84] corrected and enlarged. While we were enjoying the meal,\r\n    which was directed by a cook from 'La Campana,' an orchestra\r\n    played harmonious melodies. The beautiful young lady of the\r\n    house, in a mestiza gown [85] and a cascade of diamonds,\r\n    was as ever the queen of the feast.. All of us deplored from\r\n    the bottom of our hearts a light sprain in her shapely foot\r\n    that deprived her of the pleasures of the dance, for if we\r\n    have to judge by her other conspicuous perfections, the young\r\n    lady must dance like a sylph.\r\n\r\n    \"The alcalde of the province arrived this afternoon for\r\n    the purpose of honoring with his presence the ceremony of\r\n    tomorrow. He has expressed regret over the poor health of the\r\n    distinguished landlord, Señor Ibarra, who in God's mercy is\r\n    now, according to report, somewhat recovered.\r\n\r\n    \"Tonight there was a solemn procession, but of that I will\r\n    speak in my letter tomorrow, because in addition to the\r\n    explosions that have bewildered me and made me somewhat deaf\r\n    I am tired and falling over with sleep. While, therefore,\r\n    I recover my strength in the arms of Morpheus--or rather on\r\n    a cot in the convento--I desire for you, my distinguished\r\n    friend, a pleasant night and take leave of you until tomorrow,\r\n    which will be the great day.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Your affectionate friend,\r\n\r\n\r\n    SAN DIEGO, November 11.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE CORRESPONDENT.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThus wrote the worthy correspondent. Now let us see what Capitan\r\nMartin wrote to his friend, Luis Chiquito:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"DEAR CHOY,--Come a-running if you can, for there's something\r\n    doing at the fiesta. Just imagine, Capitan Joaquin is almost\r\n    broke. Capitan Tiago has doubled up on him three times and\r\n    won at the first turn of the cards each time, so that Capitan\r\n    Manuel, the owner of the house, is growing smaller every\r\n    minute from sheer joy. Padre Damaso smashed a lamp with his\r\n    fist because up to now he hasn't won on a single card. The\r\n    Consul has lost on his cocks and in the bank all that he won\r\n    from us at the fiesta of Biñan and at that of the Virgin of\r\n    the Pillar in Santa Cruz.\r\n\r\n    \"We expected Capitan Tiago to bring us his future son-in-law,\r\n    the rich heir of Don Rafael, but it seems that he wishes to\r\n    imitate his father, for he does not even show himself. It's\r\n    a pity, for it seems he never will be any use to us.\r\n\r\n    \"Carlos the Chinaman is making a big fortune with the\r\n    _liam-pó_. I suspect that he carries something hidden,\r\n    probably a charm, for he complains constantly of headaches and\r\n    keeps his head bandaged, and when the wheel of the _liam-pó_\r\n    is slowing down he leans over, almost touching it, as if he\r\n    were looking at it closely. I am shocked, because I know more\r\n    stories of the same kind.\r\n\r\n    \"Good-by, Choy. My birds are well and my wife is happy and\r\n    having a good time.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Your friend,\r\n\r\n\r\n    MARTIN ARISTORENAS.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIbarra had received a perfumed note which Andeng, Maria Clara's\r\nfoster-sister, delivered to him on the evening of the first day of\r\nthe fiesta. This note said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"CRISOSTOMO,--It has been over a day since you have shown\r\n    yourself. I have heard that you are ill and have prayed for\r\n    you and lighted two candles, although papa says that you are\r\n    not seriously ill. Last night and today I've been bored by\r\n    requests to play on the piano and by invitations to dance. I\r\n    didn't know before that there are so many tiresome people\r\n    in the world! If it were not for Padre Damaso, who tries to\r\n    entertain me by talking to me and telling me many things, I\r\n    would have shut myself up in my room and gone to sleep. Write\r\n    me what the matter is with you and I'll tell papa to visit\r\n    you. For the present I send Andeng to make you some tea,\r\n    as she knows how to prepare it well, probably better than\r\n    your servants do.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MARIA CLARA.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"P.S. If you don't come tomorrow, I won't go to the\r\n    ceremony. _Vale!_\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nThe Morning\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the first flush of dawn bands of music awoke the tired people of the\r\ntown with lively airs. Life and movement reawakened, the bells began\r\nto chime, and the explosions commenced. It was the last day of the\r\nfiesta, in fact the fiesta proper. Much was hoped for, even more than\r\non the previous day. The Brethren of the Venerable Tertiary Order were\r\nmore numerous than those of the Holy Rosary, so they smiled piously,\r\nsecure that they would humiliate their rivals. They had purchased a\r\ngreater number of tapers, wherefor the Chinese dealers had reaped a\r\nharvest and in gratitude were thinking of being baptized, although\r\nsome remarked that this was not so much on account of their faith in\r\nCatholicism as from a desire to get a wife. To this the pious women\r\nanswered, \"Even so, the marriage of so many Chinamen at once would\r\nbe little short of a miracle and their wives would convert them.\"\r\n\r\nThe people arrayed themselves in their best clothes and dragged out\r\nfrom their strong-boxes all their jewelry. The sharpers and gamblers\r\nall shone in embroidered camisas with large diamond studs, heavy\r\ngold chains, and white straw hats. Only the old Sage went his way\r\nas usual in his dark-striped sinamay camisa buttoned up to the neck,\r\nloose shoes, and wide gray felt hat.\r\n\r\n\"You look sadder than ever!\" the teniente-mayor accosted him. \"Don't\r\nyou want us to be happy now and then, since we have so much to\r\nweep over?\"\r\n\r\n\"To be happy doesn't mean to act the fool,\" answered the old man. \"It's\r\nthe senseless orgy of every year! And all for no end but to squander\r\nmoney, when there is so much misery and want. Yes, I understand it all,\r\nit's the same orgy, the revel to drown the woes of all.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know that I share your opinion, though,\" replied Don Filipo,\r\nhalf jestingly and half in earnest. \"I have defended it, but what\r\ncan one do against the gobernadorcillo and the curate?\"\r\n\r\n\"Resign!\" was the old man's curt answer as he moved away.\r\n\r\nDon Filipo stood perplexed, staring after the old man. \"Resign!\" he\r\nmuttered as he made his way toward the church. \"Resign! Yes, if this\r\noffice were an honor and not a burden, yes, I would resign.\"\r\n\r\nThe paved court in front of the church was filled with people; men\r\nand women, young and old, dressed in their best clothes, all crowded\r\ntogether, came and went through the wide doors. There was a smell\r\nof powder, of flowers, of incense, and of perfumes, while bombs,\r\nrockets, and serpent-crackers made the women run and scream, the\r\nchildren laugh. One band played in front of the convento, another\r\nescorted the town officials, and still others marched about the\r\nstreets, where floated and waved a multitude of banners. Variegated\r\ncolors and lights distracted the sight, melodies and explosions the\r\nhearing, while the bells kept up a ceaseless chime. Moving all about\r\nwere carriages whose horses at times became frightened, frisked and\r\nreared all of which, while not included in the program of the fiesta,\r\nformed a show in itself, free and by no means the least entertaining.\r\n\r\nThe _hermano mayor_ for this day had sent servants to seek in the\r\nstreets for whomsoever they might invite, as did he who gave the\r\nfeast of which the Gospel tells us. Almost by force were urged\r\ninvitations to partake of chocolate, coffee, tea, and sweetmeats,\r\nthese invitations not seldom reaching the proportions of a demand.\r\n\r\nThere was to be celebrated the high mass, that known as the dalmatic,\r\nlike the one of the day before, about which the worthy correspondent\r\nwrote, only that now the officiating priest was to be Padre Salvi,\r\nand that the alcalde of the province, with many other Spaniards and\r\npersons of note, was to attend it in order to hear Padre Damaso,\r\nwho enjoyed a great reputation in the province. Even the alferez,\r\nsmarting under the preachments of Padre Salvi, would also attend in\r\norder to give evidence of his good-will and to recompense himself,\r\nif possible, for the bad spells the curate had caused him.\r\n\r\nSuch was the reputation of Padre Damaso that the correspondent wrote\r\nbeforehand to the editor of his newspaper:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"As was announced in my badly executed account of yesterday, so it\r\nhas come to pass. We have had the especial pleasure of listening\r\nto the Very Reverend Fray Damaso Verdolagas, former curate of this\r\ntown, recently transferred to a larger parish in recognition of\r\nhis meritorious services. The illustrious and holy orator occupied\r\nthe pulpit of the Holy Ghost and preached a most eloquent and\r\nprofound sermon, which edified and left marveling all the faithful\r\nwho had waited so anxiously to see spring from his fecund lips\r\nthe restoring fountain of eternal life. Sublimity of conception,\r\nboldness of imagination, novelty of phraseology, gracefulness of style,\r\nnaturalness of gestures, cleverness of speech, vigor of ideas--these\r\nare the traits of the Spanish Bossuet, who has justly earned such\r\na high reputation not only among the enlightened Spaniards but even\r\namong the rude Indians and the cunning sons of the Celestial Empire.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the confiding correspondent almost saw himself obliged to erase\r\nwhat he had written. Padre Damaso complained of a cold that he had\r\ncontracted the night before, for after singing a few merry songs he\r\nhad eaten three plates of ice-cream and attended the show for a short\r\ntime. As a result of all this, he wished to renounce his part as the\r\nspokesman of God to men, but as no one else was to be found who was so\r\nwell versed in the life and miracles of San Diego,--the curate knew\r\nthem, it is true, but it was his place to celebrate mass,--the other\r\npriests unanimously declared that the tone of Padre Damaso's voice\r\ncould not be improved upon and that it would be a great pity for\r\nhim to forego delivering such an eloquent sermon as he had written\r\nand memorized. Accordingly, his former housekeeper prepared for him\r\nlemonade, rubbed his chest and neck with liniment and olive-oil,\r\nmassaged him, and wrapped him in warm cloths. He drank some raw\r\neggs beaten up in wine and for the whole morning neither talked nor\r\nbreakfasted, taking only a glass of milk and a cup of chocolate with a\r\ndozen or so of crackers, heroically renouncing his usual fried chicken\r\nand half of a Laguna cheese, because the housekeeper affirmed that\r\ncheese contained salt and grease, which would aggravate his cough.\r\n\r\n\"All for the sake of meriting heaven and of converting us!\" exclaimed\r\nthe Tertiary Sisters, much affected, upon being informed of these\r\nsacrifices.\r\n\r\n\"May Our Lady of Peace punish him!\" muttered the Sisters of the Holy\r\nRosary, unable to forgive him for leaning to the side of their rivals.\r\n\r\nAt half past eight the procession started from the shadow of the\r\ncanvas canopy. It was the same as that of the previous day but for\r\nthe introduction of one novelty: the older members of the Venerable\r\nTertiary Order and some maidens dressed as old women displayed long\r\ngowns, the poor having them of coarse cloth and the rich of silk,\r\nor rather of Franciscan _guingón_, as it is called, since it is most\r\nused by the reverend Franciscan friars. All these sacred garments\r\nwere genuine, having come from the convento in Manila, where the\r\npeople may obtain them as alms at a fixed price, if a commercial term\r\nmay be permitted; this fixed price was liable to increase but not to\r\nreduction. In the convento itself and in the nunnery of St. Clara [86]\r\nare sold these same garments which possess, besides the special merit\r\nof gaining many indulgences for those who may be shrouded in them,\r\nthe very special merit of being dearer in proportion as they are old,\r\nthreadbare, and unserviceable. We write this in case any pious reader\r\nneed such sacred relics--or any cunning rag-picker of Europe wish to\r\nmake a fortune by taking to the Philippines a consignment of patched\r\nand grimy garments, since they are valued at sixteen pesos or more,\r\naccording to their more or less tattered appearance.\r\n\r\nSan Diego de Alcala was borne on a float adorned with plates of\r\nrepoussé silver. The saint, though rather thin, had an ivory bust\r\nwhich gave him a severe and majestic mien, in spite of abundant kingly\r\nbangs like those of the Negrito. His mantle was of satin embroidered\r\nwith gold.\r\n\r\nOur venerable father, St. Francis, followed the Virgin as on yesterday,\r\nexcept that the priest under the canopy this time was Padre Salvi\r\nand not the graceful Padre Sibyla, so refined in manner. But if the\r\nformer lacked a beautiful carriage he had more than enough unction,\r\nwalking half bent over with lowered eyes and hands crossed in mystic\r\nattitude. The bearers of the canopy were the same cabezas de barangay,\r\nsweating with satisfaction at seeing themselves at the same time\r\nsemi-sacristans, collectors of the tribute, redeemers of poor erring\r\nhumanity, and consequently Christs who were giving their blood for\r\nthe sins of others. The surpliced coadjutor went from float to float\r\ncarrying the censer, with the smoke from which he from time to time\r\nregaled the nostrils of the curate, who then became even more serious\r\nand grave.\r\n\r\nSo the procession moved forward slowly and deliberately to the\r\nsound of bombs, songs, and religious melodies let loose into the\r\nair by bands of musicians that followed the floats. Meanwhile,\r\nthe _hermano mayor_ distributed candles with such zeal that many of\r\nthe participants returned to their homes with light enough for four\r\nnights of card-playing. Devoutly the curious spectators knelt at the\r\npassage of the float of the Mother of God, reciting Credos and Salves\r\nfervently. In front of a house in whose gaily decorated windows were\r\nto be seen the alcalde, Capitan Tiago, Maria Clara, and Ibarra, with\r\nvarious Spaniards and young ladies, the float was detained. Padre\r\nSalvi happened to raise his eyes, but made not the slightest movement\r\nthat might have been taken for a salute or a recognition of them. He\r\nmerely stood erect, so that his cope fell over his shoulders more\r\ngracefully and elegantly.\r\n\r\nIn the street under the window was a young woman of pleasing\r\ncountenance, dressed in deep mourning, carrying in her arms a young\r\nbaby. She must have been a nursemaid only, for the child was white\r\nand ruddy while she was brown and had hair blacker than jet. Upon\r\nseeing the curate the tender infant held out its arms, laughed with\r\nthe laugh that neither causes nor is caused by sorrow, and cried out\r\nstammeringly in the midst of a brief silence, \"Pa-pa! Papa! Papa!\" The\r\nyoung woman shuddered, slapped her hand hurriedly over the baby's\r\nmouth and ran away in dismay, with the baby crying.\r\n\r\nMalicious ones winked at each other, and the Spaniards who had\r\nwitnessed the short scene smiled, while the natural pallor of Padre\r\nSalvi changed to the hue of poppies. Yet the people were wrong,\r\nfor the curate was not acquainted with the woman at all, she being\r\na stranger in the town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nIn the Church\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom end to end the huge barn that men dedicate as a home to the\r\nCreator of all existing things was filled with people. Pushing,\r\ncrowding, and crushing one another, the few who were leaving and\r\nthe many who were entering filled the air with exclamations of\r\ndistress. Even from afar an arm would be stretched out to dip the\r\nfingers in the holy water, but at the critical moment the surging crowd\r\nwould force the hand away. Then would be heard a complaint, a trampled\r\nwoman would upbraid some one, but the pushing would continue. Some old\r\npeople might succeed in dipping their fingers in the water, now the\r\ncolor of slime, where the population of a whole town, with transients\r\nbesides, had washed. With it they would anoint themselves devoutly,\r\nalthough with difficulty, on the neck, on the crown of the head,\r\non the forehead, on the chin, on the chest, and on the abdomen,\r\nin the assurance that thus they were sanctifying those parts and\r\nthat they would suffer neither stiff neck, headache, consumption,\r\nnor indigestion. The young people, whether they were not so ailing or\r\ndid not believe in that holy prophylactic, hardly more than moistened\r\nthe tip of a finger--and this only in order that the devout might\r\nhave no cause to talk--and pretended to make the sign of the cross on\r\ntheir foreheads, of course without touching them. \"It may be blessed\r\nand everything you may wish,\" some young woman doubtless thought,\r\n\"but it has such a color!\"\r\n\r\nIt was difficult to breathe in the heat amid the smells of the human\r\nanimal, but the preacher was worth all these inconveniences, as the\r\nsermon was costing the town two hundred and fifty pesos. Old Tasio\r\nhad said: \"Two hundred and fifty pesos for a sermon! One man on one\r\noccasion! Only a third of what comedians cost, who will work for\r\nthree nights! Surely you must be very rich!\"\r\n\r\n\"What has that to do with the drama?\" testily inquired the nervous\r\nleader of the Tertiary Brethren. \"With the drama souls go to hell but\r\nwith the sermon to heaven! If he had asked a thousand, we would have\r\npaid him and should still owe him gratitude.\"\r\n\r\n\"After all, you're right,\" replied the Sage, \"for the sermon is more\r\namusing to me at least than the drama.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I am not amused even by the drama!\" yelled the other furiously.\r\n\r\n\"I believe it, since you understand one about as well as you do the\r\nother!\" And the impious old man moved away without paying any attention\r\nto the insults and the direful prophecies that the irritated leader\r\noffered concerning his future existence.\r\n\r\nWhile they were waiting for the alcalde, the people sweated and yawned,\r\nagitating the air with fans, hats, and handkerchiefs. Children shouted\r\nand cried, which kept the sacristans busy putting them out of the\r\nsacred edifice. Such action brought to the dull and conscientious\r\nleader of the Brotherhood of the Holy Rosary this thought: \"'Suffer\r\nlittle children to come unto me,' said Our Savior, it is true, but\r\nhere must be understood, children who do not cry.\"\r\n\r\nAn old woman in a _guingón_ habit, Sister Puté, chid her granddaughter,\r\na child of six years, who was kneeling at her side, \"O lost one, give\r\nheed, for you're going to hear a sermon like that of Good Friday!\" Here\r\nthe old lady gave her a pinch to awaken the piety of the child,\r\nwho made a grimace, stuck out her nose, and wrinkled up her eyebrows.\r\n\r\nSome men squatted on their heels and dozed beside the confessional. One\r\nold man nodding caused our old woman to believe that he was mumbling\r\nprayers, so, running her fingers rapidly over the beads of her\r\nrosary--as that was the most reverent way of respecting the designs\r\nof Heaven--little by little she set herself to imitating hint.\r\n\r\nIbarra stood in one corner while Maria Clara knelt near the high\r\naltar in a space which the curate had had the courtesy to order the\r\nsacristans to clear for her. Capitan Tiago, in a frock coat, sat on\r\none of the benches provided for the authorities, which caused the\r\nchildren who did not know him to take him for another gobernadorcillo\r\nand to be wary about getting near him.\r\n\r\nAt last the alcalde with his staff arrived, proceeding from the\r\nsacristy and taking their seats in magnificent chairs placed on strips\r\nof carpet. The alcalde wore a full-dress uniform and displayed the\r\ncordon of Carlos III, with four or five other decorations. The people\r\ndid not recognize him.\r\n\r\n\"_Abá!_\" exclaimed a rustic. \"A civil-guard dressed as a comedian!\"\r\n\r\n\"Fool!\" rejoined a bystander, nudging him with his elbow. \"It's the\r\nPrince Villardo that we saw at the show last night!\"\r\n\r\nSo the alcalde went up several degrees in the popular estimation by\r\nbecoming an enchanted prince, a vanquisher of giants.\r\n\r\nWhen the mass began, those who were seated arose and those who\r\nhad been asleep were awakened by the ringing of the bells and the\r\nsonorous voices of the singers. Padre Salvi, in spite of his gravity,\r\nwore a look of deep satisfaction, since there were serving him as\r\ndeacon and subdeacon none less than two Augustinians. Each one, as\r\nit came his turn, sang well, in a more or less nasal tone and with\r\nunintelligible articulation, except the officiating priest himself,\r\nwhose voice trembled somewhat, even getting out of tune at times,\r\nto the great wonder of those who knew him. Still he moved about\r\nwith precision and elegance while he recited the _Dominus vobiscum_\r\nunctuously, dropping his head a little to the side and gazing toward\r\nheaven. Seeing him receive the smoke from the incense one would\r\nhave said that Galen was right in averring the passage of smoke in\r\nthe nasal canals to the head through a screen of ethmoids, since\r\nhe straightened himself, threw his head back, and moved toward the\r\nmiddle of the altar with such pompousness and gravity that Capitan\r\nTiago found him more majestic than the Chinese comedian of the\r\nnight before, even though the latter had been dressed as an emperor,\r\npaint-bedaubed, with beribboned sword, stiff beard like a horse's\r\nmane, and high-soled slippers. \"Undoubtedly,\" so his thoughts ran,\r\n\"a single curate of ours has more majesty than all the emperors.\"\r\n\r\nAt length came the expected moment, that of hearing Padre Damaso. The\r\nthree priests seated themselves in their chairs in an edifying\r\nattitude, as the worthy correspondent would say, the alcalde and\r\nother persons of place and position following their example. The\r\nmusic ceased.\r\n\r\nThe sudden transition from noise to silence awoke our aged Sister Puté,\r\nwho was already snoring under cover of the music. Like Segismundo,\r\n[87] or like the cook in the story of the Sleeping Beauty, the first\r\nthing that she did upon awaking was to whack her granddaughter on\r\nthe neck, as the child had also fallen asleep. The latter screamed,\r\nbut soon consoled herself at the sight of a woman who was beating her\r\nbreast with contrition and enthusiasm. All tried to place themselves\r\ncomfortably, those who had no benches squatting down on the floor or\r\non their heels.\r\n\r\nPadre Damaso passed through the congregation preceded by two\r\nsacristans and followed by another friar carrying a massive volume. He\r\ndisappeared as he went up the winding staircase, but his round head\r\nsoon reappeared, then his fat neck, followed immediately by his\r\nbody. Coughing slightly, he looked about him with assurance. He\r\nnoticed Ibarra and with a special wink gave to understand that he\r\nwould not overlook that youth in his prayers. Then he turned a look\r\nof satisfaction upon Padre Sibyla and another of disdain upon Padre\r\nMartin, the preacher of the previous day. This inspection concluded,\r\nhe turned cautiously and said, \"Attention, brother!\" to his companion,\r\nwho opened the massive volume.\r\n\r\nBut the sermon deserves a separate chapter. A young man who was then\r\nlearning stenography and who idolizes great orators, took it down;\r\nthanks to this fact, we can here present a selection from the sacred\r\noratory of those regions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nThe Sermon\r\n\r\n\r\nFray Damaso began slowly in a low voice: \"'_Et spiritum bonum dedisti,\r\nqui doceret eos, et manna tuum non prohibuisti ab ore eorum, et aquam\r\ndedisti eis in siti_. And thou gavest thy good Spirit to teach them,\r\nand thy manna thou didst not withhold from their mouth, and thou\r\ngavest them water for their thirst!' Words which the Lord spoke\r\nthrough the mouth of Esdras, in the second book, the ninth chapter,\r\nand the twentieth verse.\" [88]\r\n\r\nPadre Sibyla glanced in surprise at the preacher. Padre Manuel Martin\r\nturned pale and swallowed hard that was better than his! Whether Padre\r\nDamaso noticed this or whether he was still hoarse, the fact is that\r\nhe coughed several times as he placed both hands on the rail of the\r\npulpit. The Holy Ghost was above his head, freshly painted, clean and\r\nwhite, with rose-colored beak and feet. \"Most honorable sir\" (to the\r\nalcalde), \"most holy priests, Christians, brethren in Jesus Christ!\"\r\n\r\nHere he made a solemn pause as again he swept his gaze over the\r\ncongregation, with whose attention and concentration he seemed\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\n\"The first part of the sermon is to be in Spanish and the other in\r\nTagalog; _loquebantur omnes linguas_.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the salutations and the pause he extended his right hand\r\nmajestically toward the altar, at the same time fixing his gaze on\r\nthe alcalde. He slowly crossed his arms without uttering a word, then\r\nsuddenly passing from calmness to action, threw back his head and\r\nmade a sign toward the main door, sawing the air with his open hand\r\nso forcibly that the sacristans interpreted the gesture as a command\r\nand closed the doors. The alferez became uneasy, doubting whether\r\nhe should go or stay, when the preacher began in a strong voice,\r\nfull and sonorous; truly his old housekeeper was skilled in medicine.\r\n\r\n\"Radiant and resplendent is the altar, wide is the great door, the\r\nair is the vehicle of the holy and divine words that will spring\r\nfrom my mouth! Hear ye then with the ears of your souls and hearts\r\nthat the words of the Lord may not fall on the stony soil where the\r\nbirds of Hell may consume them, but that ye may grow and flourish\r\nas holy seed in the field of our venerable and seraphic father,\r\nSt. Francis! O ye great sinners, captives of the Moros of the soul\r\nthat infest the sea of eternal life in the powerful craft of the\r\nflesh and the world, ye who are laden with the fetters of lust and\r\navarice, and who toil in the galleys of the infernal Satan, look\r\nye here with reverent repentance upon him who saved souls from the\r\ncaptivity of the devil, upon the intrepid Gideon, upon the valiant\r\nDavid, upon the triumphant Roland of Christianity, upon the celestial\r\nCivil Guard, more powerful than all the Civil Guards together, now\r\nexisting or to exist!\" (The alferez frowned.) \"Yes, señor alferez,\r\nmore valiant and powerful, he who with no other weapon than a wooden\r\ncross boldly vanquishes the eternal tulisan of the shades and all\r\nthe hosts of Lucifer, and who would have exterminated them forever,\r\nwere not the spirits immortal! This marvel of divine creation, this\r\nwonderful prodigy, is the blessed Diego of Alcala, who, if I may avail\r\nmyself of a comparison, since comparisons aid in the comprehension of\r\nincomprehensible things, as another has said, I say then that this\r\ngreat saint is merely a private soldier, a steward in the powerful\r\ncompany which our seraphic father, St. Francis, sends from Heaven,\r\nand to which I have the honor to belong as a corporal or sergeant,\r\nby the grace of God!\"\r\n\r\nThe \"rude Indians,\" as the correspondent would say, caught nothing\r\nmore from this paragraph than the words \"Civil Guard,\" \"tulisan,\"\r\n\"San Diego,\" and \"St. Francis,\" so, observing the wry face of the\r\nalferez and the bellicose gestures of the preacher, they deduced that\r\nthe latter was reprehending him for not running down the tulisanes. San\r\nDiego and St. Francis would be commissioned in this duty and justly\r\nso, as is proved by a picture existing in the convento at Manila,\r\nrepresenting St. Francis, by means of his girdle only, holding back the\r\nChinese invasion in the first years after the discovery. The devout\r\nwere accordingly not a little rejoiced and thanked God for this aid,\r\nnot doubting that once the tulisanes had disappeared, St. Francis would\r\nalso destroy the Civil Guard. With redoubled attention, therefore,\r\nthey listened to Padre Damaso, as he continued:\r\n\r\n\"Most honorable sir\" Great affairs are great affairs even by the side\r\nof the small and the small are always small even by the side of the\r\ngreat. So History says, but since History hits the nail on the head\r\nonly once in a hundred times, being a thing made by men, and men make\r\nmistakes--_errarle es hominum_, [89] as Cicero said--he who opens his\r\nmouth makes mistakes, as they say in my country then the result is\r\nthat there are profound truths which History does not record. These\r\ntruths, most honorable sir, the divine Spirit spoke with that supreme\r\nwisdom which human intelligence has not comprehended since the times\r\nof Seneca and Aristotle, those wise priests of antiquity, even to our\r\nsinful days, and these truths are that not always are small affairs\r\nsmall, but that they are great, not by the side of the little things,\r\nbut by the side of the grandest of the earth and of the heavens and\r\nof the air and of the clouds and of the waters and of space and of\r\nlife and of death!\"\r\n\r\n\"Amen!\" exclaimed the leader of the Tertiaries, crossing himself.\r\n\r\nWith this figure of rhetoric, which he had learned from a famous\r\npreacher in Manila, Padre Damaso wished to startle his audience,\r\nand in fact his holy ghost was so fascinated with such great truths\r\nthat it was necessary to kick him to remind him of his business.\r\n\r\n\"Patent to your eyes--\" prompted the holy ghost below.\r\n\r\n\"Patent to your eyes is the conclusive and impressive proof of this\r\neternal philosophical truth! Patent is that sun of virtue, and I say\r\nsun and not moon, for there is no great merit in the fact that the\r\nmoon shines during the night,--in the land of the blind the one-eyed\r\nman is king; by night may shine a light, a tiny star,--so the greatest\r\nmerit is to be able to shine even in the middle of the day, as the sun\r\ndoes; so shines our brother Diego even in the midst of the greatest\r\nsaints! Here you have patent to your eyes, in your impious disbelief,\r\nthe masterpiece of the Highest for the confusion of the great of the\r\nearth, yes, my brethren, patent, _patent_ to all, PATENT!\"\r\n\r\nA man rose pale and trembling and hid himself in a confessional. He was\r\na liquor dealer who had been dozing and dreaming that the carbineers\r\nwere demanding the patent, or license, that he did not have. It may\r\nsafely be affirmed that he did not come out from his hiding-place\r\nwhile the sermon lasted.\r\n\r\n\"Humble and lowly saint, thy wooden cross\" (the one that the image held\r\nwas of silver), \"thy modest gown, honors the great Francis whose sons\r\nand imitators we are. We propagate thy holy race in the whole world,\r\nin the remote places, in the cities, in the towns, without distinction\r\nbetween black and white\" (the alcalde held his breath), \"suffering\r\nhardships and martyrdoms, thy holy race of faith and religion militant\"\r\n(\"Ah!\" breathed the alcalde) \"which holds the world in balance and\r\nprevents it from falling into the depths of perdition.\"\r\n\r\nHis hearers, including even Capitan Tiago, yawned little by\r\nlittle. Maria Clara was not listening to the sermon, for she knew\r\nthat Ibarra was near and was thinking about him while she fanned\r\nherself and gazed at an evangelical bull that had all the outlines\r\nof a small carabao.\r\n\r\n\"All should know by heart the Holy Scriptures and the lives of the\r\nsaints and then I should not have to preach to you, O sinners! You\r\nshould know such important and necessary things as the Lord's\r\nPrayer, although many of you have forgotten it, living now as do\r\nthe Protestants or heretics, who, like the Chinese, respect not the\r\nministers of God. But the worse for you, O ye accursed, moving as\r\nyou are toward damnation!\"\r\n\r\n\"_Abá_, Pale Lamaso, what!\" [90] muttered Carlos, the Chinese,\r\nlooking angrily at the preacher, who continued to extemporize,\r\nemitting a series of apostrophes and imprecations.\r\n\r\n\"You will die in final unrepentance, O race of heretics! God punishes\r\nyou even on this earth with jails and prisons! Women should flee from\r\nyou, the rulers should hang all of you so that the seed of Satan\r\nbe not multiplied in the vineyard of the Lord! Jesus Christ said:\r\n'If you have an evil member that leads you to sin, cut it off, and\r\ncast it into the fire--'\"\r\n\r\nHaving forgotten both his sermon and his rhetoric, Fray Damaso began to\r\nbe nervous. Ibarra became uneasy and looked about for a quiet corner,\r\nbut the church was crowded. Maria Clara neither heard nor saw anything\r\nas she was analyzing a picture, of the blessed souls in purgatory,\r\nsouls in the shape of men and women dressed in hides, with miters,\r\nhoods, and cowls, all roasting in the fire and clutching St. Francis'\r\ngirdle, which did not break even with such great weight. With that\r\nimprovisation on the preacher's part, the holy-ghost friar lost the\r\nthread of the sermon and skipped over three long paragraphs, giving\r\nthe wrong cue to the now laboriously-panting Fray Damaso.\r\n\r\n\"Who of you, O sinners, would lick the sores of a poor and ragged\r\nbeggar? Who? Let him answer by raising his hand! None! That I knew, for\r\nonly a saint like Diego de Alcala would do it. He licked all the sores,\r\nsaying to an astonished brother, 'Thus is this sick one cured!' O\r\nChristian charity! O matchless example! O virtue of virtues! O\r\ninimitable pattern! O spotless talisman!\" Here he continued a long\r\nseries of exclamations, the while crossing his arms and raising and\r\nlowering them as though he wished to fly or to frighten the birds away.\r\n\r\n\"Before dying he spoke in Latin, without knowing Latin! Marvel, O\r\nsinners! You, in spite of what you study, for which blows are given\r\nto you, you do not speak Latin, and you will die without speaking\r\nit! To speak Latin is a gift of God and therefore the Church uses\r\nLatin! I, too, speak Latin! Was God going to deny this consolation\r\nto His beloved Diego? Could he die, could he be permitted to die,\r\nwithout speaking Latin? Impossible! God wouldn't be just, He Wouldn't\r\nbe God! So he talked in Latin, and of that fact the writers of his\r\ntime bear witness!\"\r\n\r\nHe ended this exordium with the passage which had cost him the most\r\ntoil and which he had plagiarized from a great writer, Sinibaldo de\r\nMas. \"Therefore, I salute thee, illustrious Diego, the glory of our\r\nOrder! Thou art the pattern of virtue, meek with honor, humble with\r\nnobility, compliant with fortitude, temperate with ambition, hostile\r\nwith loyalty, compassionate with pardon, holy with conscientiousness,\r\nfull of faith with devotion, credulous with sincerity, chaste with\r\nlove, reserved with secrecy; long-suffering with patience, brave\r\nwith timidity, moderate with desire, bold with resolution, obedient\r\nwith subjection., modest with pride, zealous with disinterestedness,\r\nskilful with capability, ceremonious with politeness, astute with\r\nsagacity, merciful with piety, secretive with modesty, revengeful with\r\nvalor, poor on account of thy labors with true conformity, prodigal\r\nwith economy, active with ease, economical with liberality, innocent\r\nwith sagacity, reformer with consistency, indifferent with zeal for\r\nlearning: God created thee to feel the raptures of Platonic love! Aid\r\nme in singing thy greatness and thy name higher than the stars and\r\nclearer than the sun itself that circles about thy feet! Aid me, all\r\nof you, as you appeal to God for sufficient inspiration by reciting\r\nthe Ave Maria!\"\r\n\r\nAll fell upon their knees and raised a murmur like the humming of a\r\nthousand bees. The alcalde laboriously bent one knee and wagged his\r\nhead in a disgusted manner, while the alferez looked pale and penitent.\r\n\r\n\"To the devil with the curate!\" muttered one of two youths who had\r\ncome from Manila.\r\n\r\n\"Keep still!\" admonished his companion. \"His woman might hear us.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Padre Damaso, instead of reciting the Ave Maria,\r\nwas scolding his holy ghost for having skipped three of his best\r\nparagraphs; at the same time he consumed a couple of cakes and a\r\nglass of Malaga, secure of encountering therein greater inspiration\r\nthan in all the holy ghosts, whether of wood in the form of a dove\r\nor of flesh in the shape of an inattentive friar.\r\n\r\nThen he began the sermon in Tagalog. The devout old woman again gave\r\nher granddaughter a hearty slap. The child awoke ill-naturedly and\r\nasked, \"Is it time to cry now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet, O lost one, but don't go to sleep again!\" answered the\r\ngood grandmother.\r\n\r\nOf the second part of the sermon--that in Tagalog--we have only a\r\nfew rough notes, for Padre Damaso extemporized in this language,\r\nnot because he knew it better, but because, holding the provincial\r\nFilipinos ignorant of rhetoric, he was not afraid of making blunders\r\nbefore them. With Spaniards the case was different; he had heard\r\nrules of oratory spoken of, and it was possible that among his hearers\r\nsome one had been in college-halls, perhaps the alcalde, so he wrote\r\nout his sermons, corrected and polished them, and then memorized and\r\nrehearsed them for several days beforehand.\r\n\r\nIt is common knowledge that none of those present understood the drift\r\nof the sermon. They were so dull of understanding and the preacher\r\nwas so profound, as Sister Rufa said, that the audience waited in\r\nvain for an opportunity to weep, and the lost grandchild of the\r\nblessed old woman went to sleep again. Nevertheless, this part had\r\ngreater consequences than the first, at least for certain hearers,\r\nas we shall see later.\r\n\r\nHe began with a \"_Mana capatir con cristiano_,\" [91] followed by an\r\navalanche of untranslatable phrases. He talked of the soul, of Hell,\r\nof \"_mahal na santo pintacasi_,\" [92] of the Indian sinners and of\r\nthe virtuous Franciscan Fathers.\r\n\r\n\"The devil!\" exclaimed one of the two irreverent Manilans to his\r\ncompanion. \"That's all Greek to me. I'm going.\" Seeing the doors\r\nclosed, he went out through the sacristy, to the great scandal of\r\nthe people and especially of the preacher, who turned pale and paused\r\nin the midst of his sentence. Some looked for a violent apostrophe,\r\nbut Padre Damaso contented himself with watching the delinquent,\r\nand then he went on with his sermon.\r\n\r\nThen were let loose curses upon the age, against the lack of reverence,\r\nagainst the growing indifference to Religion. This matter seemed to\r\nbe his forte, for he appeared to be inspired and expressed himself\r\nwith force and clearness. He talked of the sinners who did not attend\r\nconfession, who died in prisons without the sacraments, of families\r\naccursed, of proud and puffed-up little half-breeds, of young sages\r\nand little philosophers, of pettifoggers, of picayunish students,\r\nand so on. Well known is this habit that many have when they wish\r\nto ridicule their enemies; they apply to them belittling epithets\r\nbecause their brains do not appear to furnish them any other means,\r\nand thus they are happy.\r\n\r\nIbarra heard it all and understood the allusions. Preserving an outward\r\ncalm, he turned his eyes to God and the authorities, but saw nothing\r\nmore than the images of saints, and the alcalde was sleeping.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the preacher's enthusiasm was rising by degrees. He spoke\r\nof the times when every Filipino upon meeting a priest took off\r\nhis hat, knelt on the ground, and kissed the priest's hand. \"But\r\nnow,\" he added, \"you only take off your salakot or your felt hat,\r\nwhich you have placed on the side of your head in order not to\r\nruffle your nicely combed hair! You content yourself with saying,\r\n'good day, _among_,' and there are proud dabblers in a little Latin\r\nwho, from having studied in Manila or in Europe, believe that they\r\nhave the right to shake a priest's hand instead of kissing it. Ah,\r\nthe day of judgment will quickly come, the world will end, as many\r\nsaints have foretold; it will rain fire, stones, and ashes to chastise\r\nyour pride!\" The people were exhorted not to imitate such \"savages\"\r\nbut to hate and shun them, since they were beyond the religious pale.\r\n\r\n\"Hear what the holy decrees say! When an Indian meets a curate in the\r\nstreet he should bow his head and offer his neck for his master to\r\nstep upon. If the curate and the Indian are both on horseback, then\r\nthe Indian should stop and take off his hat or salakot reverently;\r\nand finally, if the Indian is on horseback and the curate on foot,\r\nthe Indian should alight and not mount again until the curate has\r\ntold him to go on, or is far away. This is what the holy decrees say\r\nand he who does not obey will be excommunicated.\"\r\n\r\n\"And when one is riding a carabao?\" asked a scrupulous countryman of\r\nhis neighbor.\r\n\r\n\"Then--keep on going!\" answered the latter, who was a casuist.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of the cries and gestures of the preacher many fell\r\nasleep or wandered in their attention, since these sermons were\r\never the same. In vain some devout women tried to sigh and sob\r\nover the sins of the wicked; they had to desist in the attempt from\r\nlack of supporters. Even Sister Puté was thinking of something quite\r\ndifferent. A man beside her had dropped off to sleep in such a way that\r\nhe had fallen over and crushed her habit, so the good woman caught\r\nup one of her clogs and with blows began to wake him, crying out,\r\n\"Get away, savage, brute, devil, carabao, cur, accursed!\"\r\n\r\nNaturally, this caused somewhat of a stir. The preacher paused and\r\narched his eyebrows, surprised at so great a scandal. Indignation\r\nchoked the words in his throat and he was able only to bellow, while\r\nhe pounded the pulpit with his fists. This had the desired effect,\r\nhowever, for the old woman, though still grumbling, dropped her clog\r\nand, crossing herself repeatedly, fell devoutly upon her knees.\r\n\r\n\"Aaah! Aaah!\" the indignant priest was at last able to roar out as\r\nhe crossed his arms and shook his head. \"For this do I preach to\r\nyou the whole morning, savages! Here in the house of God you quarrel\r\nand curse, shameless ones! Aaaah! You respect nothing! This is the\r\nresult of the luxury and the looseness of the age! That's just what\r\nI've told you, aah!\"\r\n\r\nUpon this theme he continued to preach for half an hour. The alcalde\r\nsnored, and Maria Clara nodded, for the poor child could no longer keep\r\nfrom sleeping, since she had no more paintings or images to study,\r\nnor anything else to amuse her. On Ibarra the words and allusions\r\nmade no more impression, for he was thinking of a cottage on the top\r\nof a mountain and saw Maria Clara in the garden; let men crawl about\r\nin their miserable towns in the depths of the valley!\r\n\r\nPadre Salvi had caused the altar bell to be rung twice, but this was\r\nonly adding fuel to the flame, for Padre Damaso became stubborn and\r\nprolonged the sermon. Fray Sibyla gnawed at his lips and repeatedly\r\nadjusted his gold-mounted eye-glasses. Fray Manuel Martin was the\r\nonly one who appeared to listen with pleasure, for he was smiling.\r\n\r\nBut at last God said \"Enough\"; the orator became weary and descended\r\nfrom the pulpit. All knelt to render thanks to God. The alcalde rubbed\r\nhis eyes, stretched out one arm as if to waken himself, and yawned\r\nwith a deep _aah_. The mass continued.\r\n\r\nWhen all were kneeling and the priests had lowered their heads while\r\nthe _Incarnatus est_ was being sung, a man murmured in Ibarra's ear,\r\n\"At the laying of the cornerstone, don't move away from the curate,\r\ndon't go down into the trench, don't go near the stone--your life\r\ndepends upon it!\"\r\n\r\nIbarra turned to see Elias, who, as soon as he had said this,\r\ndisappeared in the crowd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nThe Derrick\r\n\r\n\r\nThe yellowish individual had kept his word, for it was no simple\r\nderrick that he had erected above the open trench to let the heavy\r\nblock of granite down into its place. It was not the simple tripod\r\nthat Ñor Juan had wanted for suspending a pulley from its top, but\r\nwas much more, being at once a machine and an ornament, a grand and\r\nimposing ornament. Over eight meters in height rose the confused\r\nand complicated scaffolding. Four thick posts sunk in the ground\r\nserved as a frame, fastened to each other by huge timbers crossing\r\ndiagonally and joined by large nails driven in only half-way, perhaps\r\nfor the reason that the apparatus was simply for temporary use and\r\nthus might easily be taken down again. Huge cables stretched from all\r\nsides gave an appearance of solidity and grandeur to the whole. At\r\nthe top it was crowned with many-colored banners, streaming pennants,\r\nand enormous garlands of flowers and leaves artistically interwoven.\r\n\r\nThere at the top in the shadow made by the posts, the garlands, and\r\nthe banners, hung fastened with cords and iron hooks an unusually\r\nlarge three-wheeled pulley over the polished sides of which passed\r\nin a crotch three cables even larger than the others. These held\r\nsuspended the smooth, massive stone hollowed out in the center\r\nto form with a similar hole in the lower stone, already in place,\r\nthe little space intended to contain the records of contemporaneous\r\nhistory, such as newspapers, manuscripts, money, medals, and the like,\r\nand perhaps to transmit them to very remote generations. The cables\r\nextended downward and connected with another equally large pulley\r\nat the bottom of the apparatus, whence they passed to the drum of\r\na windlass held in place by means of heavy timbers. This windlass,\r\nwhich could be turned with two cranks, increased the strength of a\r\nman a hundredfold by the movement of notched wheels, although it is\r\ntrue that what was gained in force was lost in velocity.\r\n\r\n\"Look,\" said the yellowish individual, turning the crank, \"look,\r\nÑor Juan, how with merely my own strength I can raise and lower the\r\ngreat stone. It's so well arranged that at will I can regulate the\r\nrise or fall inch by inch, so that a man in the trench can easily\r\nfit the stones together while I manage it from here.\"\r\n\r\nÑor Juan could not but gaze in admiration at the speaker, who was\r\nsmiling in his peculiar way. Curious bystanders made remarks praising\r\nthe yellowish individual.\r\n\r\n\"Who taught you mechanics?\" asked Ñor Juan.\r\n\r\n\"My father, my dead father,\" was the answer, accompanied by his\r\npeculiar smile.\r\n\r\n\"Who taught your father?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don Saturnino, the grandfather of Don Crisostomo.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't know that Don Saturnino--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he knew a lot of things! He not only beat his laborers well and\r\nexposed them out in the sun, but he also knew how to wake the sleepers\r\nand put the waking to sleep. You'll see in time what my father taught\r\nme, you'll see!\"\r\n\r\nHere the yellowish individual smiled again, but in a strange way.\r\n\r\nOn a tame covered with a piece of Persian tapestry rested a leaden\r\ncylinder containing the objects that were to be kept in the tomb-like\r\nreceptacle and a glass case with thick sides, which would hold that\r\nmummy of an epoch and preserve for the future the records of a past.\r\n\r\nTasio, the Sage, who was walking about there thoughtfully, murmured:\r\n\"Perchance some day when this edifice, which is today begun, has grown\r\nold and after many vicissitudes has fallen into ruins, either from\r\nthe visitations of Nature or the destructive hand of man, and above\r\nthe ruins grow the ivy and the moss,--then when Time has destroyed the\r\nmoss and ivy, and scattered the ashes of the ruins themselves to the\r\nwinds, wiping from the pages of History the recollection of it and\r\nof those who destroyed it, long since lost from the memory of man:\r\nperchance when the races have been buried in their mantle of earth or\r\nhave disappeared, only by accident the pick of some miner striking a\r\nspark from this rock will dig up mysteries and enigmas from the depths\r\nof the soil. Perchance the learned men of the nation that dwells in\r\nthese regions will labor, as do the present Egyptologists, with the\r\nremains of a great civilization which occupied itself with eternity,\r\nlittle dreaming that upon it was descending so long a night. Perchance\r\nsome learned professor will say to his students of five or six years of\r\nage, in a language spoken by all mankind, 'Gentlemen, after studying\r\nand examining carefully the objects found in the depths of our soil,\r\nafter deciphering some symbols and translating a few words, we can\r\nwithout the shadow of a doubt conclude that these objects belonged to\r\nthe barbaric age of man, to that obscure era which we are accustomed\r\nto speak of as fabulous. In short, gentlemen, in order that you may\r\nform an approximate idea of the backwardness of our ancestors, it will\r\nbe sufficient that I point out to you the fact that those who lived\r\nhere not only recognized kings, but also for the purpose of settling\r\nquestions of local government they had to go to the other side of the\r\nearth, just as if we should say that a body in order to move itself\r\nwould need to consult a head existing in another part of the globe,\r\nperhaps in regions now sunk under the waves. This incredible defect,\r\nhowever improbable it may seem to us now, must have existed, if we\r\ntake into consideration the circumstances surrounding those beings,\r\nwhom I scarcely dare to call human! In those primitive times men were\r\nstill (or at least so they believed) in direct communication with their\r\nCreator, since they had ministers from Him, beings different from the\r\nrest, designated always with the mysterious letters \"M. R. P.\", [93]\r\nconcerning the meaning of which our learned men do not agree. According\r\nto the professor of languages whom we have here, rather mediocre, since\r\nhe does not speak more than a hundred of the imperfect languages of\r\nthe past, \"M. R. P.\" may signify \"_Muy Rico Propietario_.\" [94] These\r\nministers were a species of demigods, very virtuous and enlightened,\r\nand were very eloquent orators, who, in spite of their great power and\r\nprestige, never committed the slightest fault, which fact strengthens\r\nmy belief in supposing that they were of a nature distinct from the\r\nrest. If this were not sufficient to sustain my belief, there yet\r\nremains the argument, disputed by no one and day by day confirmed,\r\nthat these mysterious beings could make God descend to earth merely\r\nby saying a few words, that God could speak only through their mouths,\r\nthat they ate His flesh and drank His blood, and even at times allowed\r\nthe common folk to do the same.'\"\r\n\r\nThese and other opinions the skeptical Sage put into the mouths of\r\nall the corrupt men of the future. Perhaps, as may easily be the case,\r\nold Tasio was mistaken, but we must return to our story.\r\n\r\nIn the kiosks which we saw two days ago occupied by the schoolmaster\r\nand his pupils, there was now spread out a toothsome and abundant\r\nmeal. Noteworthy is the fact that on the table prepared for the school\r\nchildren there was not a single bottle of wine but an abundance of\r\nfruits. In the arbors joining the two kiosks were the seats for the\r\nmusicians and a table covered with sweetmeats and confections, with\r\nbottles of water for the thirsty public, all decorated with leaves\r\nand flowers. The schoolmaster had erected near by a greased pole and\r\nhurdles, and had hung up pots and pans for a number of games.\r\n\r\nThe crowd, resplendent in bright-colored garments, gathered as people\r\nfled from the burning sun, some into the shade of the trees, others\r\nunder the arbor. The boys climbed up into the branches or on the stones\r\nin order to see the ceremony better, making up in this way for their\r\nshort stature. They looked with envy at the clean and well-dressed\r\nschool children, who occupied a place especially assigned to them and\r\nwhose parents were overjoyed, as they, poor country folk, would see\r\ntheir children eat from a white tablecloth, almost the same as the\r\ncurate or the alcalde. Thinking of this alone was enough to drive\r\naway hunger, and such an event would be recounted from father to son.\r\n\r\nSoon were heard the distant strains of the band, which was preceded\r\nby a motley throng made up of persons of all ages, in clothing of\r\nall colors. The yellowish individual became uneasy and with a glance\r\nexamined his whole apparatus. A curious countryman followed his glance\r\nand watched all his movements; this was Elias, who had also come to\r\nwitness the ceremony, but in his salakot and rough attire he was almost\r\nunrecognizable. He had secured a very good position almost at the side\r\nof the windlass, on the edge of the excavation. With the music came\r\nthe alcalde, the municipal officials, the friars, with the exception\r\nof Padre Damaso, and the Spanish employees. Ibarra was conversing with\r\nthe alcalde, of whom he had made quite a friend since he had addressed\r\nto him some well-turned compliments over his decorations and ribbons,\r\nfor aristocratic pretensions were the weakness of his Honor. Capitan\r\nTiago, the alferez, and some other wealthy personages came in the\r\ngilded cluster of maidens displaying their silken parasols. Padre\r\nSalvi followed, silent and thoughtful as ever.\r\n\r\n\"Count upon my support always in any worthy enterprise,\" the alcalde\r\nwas saying to Ibarra. \"I will give you whatever appropriation you\r\nneed or else see that it is furnished by others.\"\r\n\r\nAs they drew nearer the youth felt his heart beat faster. Instinctively\r\nhe glanced at the strange scaffolding raised there. He saw the\r\nyellowish individual salute him respectfully and gaze at him fixedly\r\nfor a moment. With surprise he noticed Elias, who with a significant\r\nwink gave him to understand that he should remember the warning in\r\nthe church.\r\n\r\nThe curate put on his sacerdotal robes and commenced the ceremony,\r\nwhile the one-eyed sacristan held the book and an acolyte the\r\nhyssop and jar of holy water. The rest stood about him uncovered,\r\nand maintained such a profound silence that, in spite of his reading\r\nin a low tone, it was apparent that Padre Salvi's voice was trembling.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, there had been placed in the glass case the manuscripts,\r\nnewspapers, medals, coins, and the like, and the whole enclosed in\r\nthe leaden cylinder, which was then hermetically sealed.\r\n\r\n\"Señor Ibarra, will you put the box in its place? The curate is\r\nwaiting,\" murmured the alcalde into the young man's ear.\r\n\r\n\"I would with great pleasure,\" answered the latter, \"but that would\r\nbe usurping the honorable duty of the escribano. The escribano must\r\nmake affidavit of the act.\"\r\n\r\nSo the escribano gravely took the box, descended the carpeted stairway\r\nleading to the bottom of the excavation and with due solemnity placed\r\nit in the hole in the stone. The curate then took the hyssop and\r\nsprinkled the stones with holy water.\r\n\r\nNow the moment had arrived for each one to place his trowelful of\r\nmortar on the face of the large stone lying in the trench, in order\r\nthat the other might be fitted and fastened to it. Ibarra handed\r\nthe alcalde a mason's trowel, on the wide silver Made of which was\r\nengraved the date. But the alcalde first gave a harangue in Spanish:\r\n\r\n\"People of San Diego! We have the honor to preside over a ceremony\r\nwhose importance you will not understand unless We tell you of it. A\r\nschool is being founded, and the school is the basis of society, the\r\nschool is the book in which is written the future of the nations! Show\r\nus the schools of a people and We will show you what that people is.\r\n\r\n\"People of San Diego! Thank God, who has given you holy priests,\r\nand the government of the mother country, which untiringly spreads\r\ncivilization through these fertile isles, protected beneath her\r\nglorious mantle! Thank God, who has taken pity on you and sent you\r\nthese humble priests who enlighten you and teach you the divine\r\nword! Thank the government, which has made, is making, and will\r\ncontinue to make, so many sacrifices for you and your children!\r\n\r\n\"And now that the first stone of this important edifice is consecrated,\r\nWe, alcalde-mayor of this province, in the name of his Majesty the\r\nKing, whom God preserve, King of the Spains, in the name of the\r\nillustrious Spanish government and under the protection of its\r\nspotless and ever-victorious banner, We consecrate this act and\r\nbegin the construction of this schoolhouse! People of San Diego,\r\nlong live the King! Long live Spain! Long live the friars! Long live\r\nthe Catholic Religion!\"\r\n\r\nMany voices were raised in answer, adding, \"Long live the Señor\r\nAlcalde!\"\r\n\r\nHe then majestically descended to the strains of the band, which\r\nbegan to play, deposited several trowelfuls of mortar on the stone,\r\nand with equal majesty reascended. The employees applauded.\r\n\r\nIbarra offered another trowel to the curate, who, after fixing his\r\neyes on him for a moment, descended slowly. Half-way down the steps he\r\nraised his eyes to look at the stone, which hung fastened by the stout\r\ncables, but this was only for a second, and he then went on down. He\r\ndid the same as the alcalde, but this time more applause was heard,\r\nfor to the employees were added some friars and Capitan Tiago.\r\n\r\nPadre Salvi then seemed to seek for some one to whom he might give the\r\ntrowel. He looked doubtfully at Maria Clara, but changing his mind,\r\noffered it to the escribano. The latter in gallantry offered it to\r\nMaria Clara, who smilingly refused it. The friars, the employees,\r\nand the alferez went down one after another, nor was Capitan Tiago\r\nforgotten. Ibarra only was left, and the order was about to be given\r\nfor the yellowish individual to lower the stone when the curate\r\nremembered the youth and said to him in a joking tone, with affected\r\nfamiliarity:\r\n\r\n\"Aren't you going to put on your trowelful, Señor Ibarra?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should be a Juan Palomo, to prepare the meal and eat it myself,\"\r\nanswered the latter in the same tone.\r\n\r\n\"Go on!\" said the alcalde, shoving him forward gently. \"Otherwise,\r\nI'll order that the stone be not lowered at all and we'll be here\r\nuntil doomsday.\"\r\n\r\nBefore such a terrible threat Ibarra had to obey. He exchanged the\r\nsmall silver trowel for a large iron one, an act which caused some of\r\nthe spectators to smile, and went forward tranquilly. Elias gazed at\r\nhim with such an indefinable expression that on seeing it one might\r\nhave said that his whole life was concentrated in his eyes. The\r\nyellowish individual stared into the trench, which opened at his\r\nfeet. After directing a rapid glance at the heavy stone hanging over\r\nhis head and another at Elias and the yellowish individual, Ibarra\r\nsaid to Ñor Juan in a somewhat unsteady voice, \"Give me the mortar\r\nand get me another trowel up there.\"\r\n\r\nThe youth remained alone. Elias no longer looked at him, for his\r\neyes were fastened on the hand of the yellowish individual, who,\r\nleaning over the trench, was anxiously following the movements of\r\nIbarra. There was heard the noise of the trowel scraping on the\r\nstone in the midst of a feeble murmur among the employees, who were\r\ncongratulating the alcalde on his speech.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a crash was heard. The pulley tied at the base of the derrick\r\njumped up and after it the windlass, which struck the heavy posts like\r\na battering-ram. The timbers shook, the fastenings flew apart, and\r\nthe whole apparatus fell in a second with a frightful crash. A cloud\r\nof dust arose, while a cry of horror from a thousand voices filled\r\nthe air. Nearly all fled; only a few dashed toward the trench. Maria\r\nClara and Padre Salvi remained in their places, pale, motionless,\r\nand speechless.\r\n\r\nWhen the dust had cleared away a little, they saw Ibarra standing among\r\nbeams, posts, and cables, between the windlass and the heavy stone,\r\nwhich in its rapid descent had shaken and crushed everything. The youth\r\nstill held the trowel in his hand and was staring with frightened\r\neyes at the body of a man which lay at his feet half-buried among\r\nthe timbers.\r\n\r\n\"You're not killed! You're still alive! For God's sake, speak!\" cried\r\nseveral employees, full of terror and solicitude.\r\n\r\n\"A miracle! A miracle!\" shouted some.\r\n\r\n\"Come and extricate the body of this poor devil!\" exclaimed Ibarra\r\nlike one arousing himself from sleep.\r\n\r\nOn hearing his voice Maria Clara felt her strength leave her and fell\r\nhalf-fainting into the arms of her friends.\r\n\r\nGreat confusion prevailed. All were talking, gesticulating, running\r\nabout, descending into the trench, coming up again, all amazed and\r\nterrified.\r\n\r\n\"Who is the dead man? Is he still alive?\" asked the alferez.\r\n\r\nThe corpse was identified as that of the yellowish individual who\r\nhad been operating the windlass.\r\n\r\n\"Arrest the foreman on the work!\" was the first thing that the alcalde\r\nwas able to say.\r\n\r\nThey examined the corpse, placing their hands on the chest, but the\r\nheart had ceased to beat. The blow had struck him on the head, and\r\nblood was flowing from his nose, mouth, and ears. On his neck were\r\nto be noticed some peculiar marks, four deep depressions toward the\r\nback and one more somewhat larger on the other side, which induced\r\nthe belief that a hand of steel had caught him as in a pair of pincers.\r\n\r\nThe priests felicitated the youth warmly and shook his hand. The\r\nFranciscan of humble aspect who had served as holy ghost for Padre\r\nDamaso exclaimed with tearful eyes, \"God is just, God is good!\"\r\n\r\n\"When I think that a few moments before I was down there!\" said one\r\nof the employees to Ibarra. \"What if I had happened to be the last!\"\r\n\r\n\"It makes my hair stand on end!\" remarked another partly bald\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad that it happened to you and not to me,\" murmured an old\r\nman tremblingly.\r\n\r\n\"Don Pascual!\" exclaimed some of the Spaniards.\r\n\r\n\"I say that because the young man is not dead. If I had not been\r\ncrushed, I should have died afterwards merely from thinking about it.\"\r\n\r\nBut Ibarra was already at a distance informing himself as to Maria\r\nClara's condition.\r\n\r\n\"Don't let this stop the fiesta, Señor Ibarra,\" said the\r\nalcalde. \"Praise God, the dead man is neither a priest nor a\r\nSpaniard! We must rejoice over your escape! Think if the stone had\r\ncaught you!\"\r\n\r\n\"There are presentiments, there are presentiments!\" exclaimed\r\nthe escribano. \"I've said so before! Señor Ibarra didn't go down\r\nwillingly. I saw it!\"\r\n\r\n\"The dead man is only an Indian!\"\r\n\r\n\"Let the fiesta go on! Music! Sadness will never resuscitate the dead!\"\r\n\r\n\"An investigation shall be made right here!\"\r\n\r\n\"Send for the directorcillo!\"\r\n\r\n\"Arrest the foreman on the work! To the stocks with him!\"\r\n\r\n\"To the stocks! Music! To the stocks with the foreman!\"\r\n\r\n\"Señor Alcalde,\" said Ibarra gravely, \"if mourning will not resuscitate\r\nthe dead, much less will arresting this man about whose guilt we know\r\nnothing. I will be security for his person and so I ask his liberty\r\nfor these days at least.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well! But don't let him do it again!\"\r\n\r\nAll kinds of rumors began to circulate. The idea of a miracle was soon\r\nan accepted fact, although Fray Salvi seemed to rejoice but little over\r\na miracle attributed to a saint of his Order and in his parish. There\r\nwere not lacking those who added that they had seen descending into\r\nthe trench, when everything was tumbling down, a figure in a dark robe\r\nlike that of the Franciscans. There was no doubt about it; it was San\r\nDiego himself! It was also noted that Ibarra had attended mass and\r\nthat the yellowish individual had not--it was all as clear as the sun!\r\n\r\n\"You see! You didn't want to go to mass!\" said a mother to her son. \"If\r\nI hadn't whipped you to make you go you would now be on your way to\r\nthe town hall, like him, in a cart!\"\r\n\r\nThe yellowish individual, or rather his corpse, wrapped up in a mat,\r\nwas in fact being carried to the town hall. Ibarra hurried home to\r\nchange his clothes.\r\n\r\n\"A bad beginning, huh!\" commented old Tasio, as he moved away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nFree Thought\r\n\r\n\r\nIbarra was just putting the finishing touches to a change of\r\nclothing when a servant informed him that a countryman was asking\r\nfor him. Supposing it to be one of his laborers, he ordered that he\r\nbe brought into his office, or study, which was at the same time a\r\nlibrary and a chemical laboratory. Greatly to his surprise he found\r\nhimself face to face with the severe and mysterious figure of Elias.\r\n\r\n\"You saved my life,\" said the pilot in Tagalog, noticing Ibarra's\r\nstart of surprise. \"I have partly paid the debt and you have nothing to\r\nthank me for, but quite the opposite. I've come to ask a favor of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Speak!\" answered the youth in the same language, puzzled by the\r\npilot's gravity.\r\n\r\nElias stared into Ibarra's eyes for some seconds before he replied,\r\n\"When human courts try to clear up this mystery, I beg of you not to\r\nspeak to any one of the warning that I gave you in the church.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry,\" answered the youth in a rather disgusted tone. \"I know\r\nthat you're wanted, but I'm no informer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's not on my account, not on my account!\" exclaimed Elias with\r\nsome vigor and haughtiness. \"It's on your own account. I fear nothing\r\nfrom men.\"\r\n\r\nIbarra's surprise increased. The tone in which this rustics--formerly\r\na pilot--spoke was new and did not seem to harmonize with either his\r\ncondition or his fortune. \"What do you mean?\" he asked, interrogating\r\nthat mysterious individual with his looks.\r\n\r\n\"I do not talk in enigmas but try to express myself clearly; for your\r\ngreater security, it is better that your enemies think you unsuspecting\r\nand unprepared.\"\r\n\r\nIbarra recoiled. \"My enemies? Have I enemies?\"\r\n\r\n\"All of us have them, sir, from the smallest insect up to man, from\r\nthe poorest and humblest to the richest and most powerful! Enmity is\r\nthe law of life!\"\r\n\r\nIbarra gazed at him in silence for a while, then murmured, \"You are\r\nneither a pilot nor a rustic!\"\r\n\r\n\"You have enemies in high and low places,\" continued Elias, without\r\nheeding the young man's words. \"You are planning a great undertaking,\r\nyou have a past. Your father and your grandfather had enemies because\r\nthey had passions, and in life it is not the criminal who provokes\r\nthe most hate but the honest man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know who my enemies are?\"\r\n\r\nElias meditated for a moment. \"I knew one--him who is dead,\" he\r\nfinally answered. \"Last night I learned that a plot against you was\r\nbeing hatched, from some words exchanged with an unknown person who\r\nlost himself in the crowd. 'The fish will not eat him, as they did his\r\nfather; you'll see tomorrow,' the unknown said. These words caught my\r\nattention not only by their meaning but also on account of the person\r\nwho uttered them, for he had some days before presented himself to\r\nthe foreman on the work with the express request that he be allowed\r\nto superintend the placing of the stone. He didn't ask for much pay\r\nbut made a show of great knowledge. I hadn't sufficient reason for\r\nbelieving in his bad intentions, but something within told me that my\r\nconjectures were true and therefore I chose as the suitable occasion\r\nto warn you a moment when you could not ask me any questions. The\r\nrest you have seen for yourself.\"\r\n\r\nFor a long time after Elias had become silent Ibarra remained\r\nthoughtful, not answering him or saying a word. \"I'm sorry that that\r\nman is dead!\" he exclaimed at length. \"From him something more might\r\nhave been learned.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he had lived, he would have escaped from the trembling hand of\r\nblind human justice. God has judged him, God has killed him, let God\r\nbe the only Judge!\"\r\n\r\nCrisostomo gazed for a moment at the man, who, while he spoke thus,\r\nexposed his muscular arms covered with lumps and bruises. \"Do you\r\nalso believe in the miracle?\" he asked with a smile. \"You know what\r\na miracle the people are talking about.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were I to believe in miracles, I should not believe in God. I\r\nshould believe in a deified man, I should believe that man had really\r\ncreated a god in his own image and likeness,\" the mysterious pilot\r\nanswered solemnly. \"But I believe in Him, I have felt His hand more\r\nthan once. When the whole apparatus was falling down and threatening\r\ndestruction to all who happened to be near it, I, I myself, caught\r\nthe criminal, I placed myself at his side. He was struck and I am\r\nsafe and sound.\"\r\n\r\n\"You! So it was you--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes! I caught him when he tried to escape, once his deadly work had\r\nbegun. I saw his crime, and I say this to you: let God be the sole\r\njudge among men, let Him be the only one to have the right over life,\r\nlet no man ever think to take His place!\"\r\n\r\n\"But you in this instance--\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" interrupted Elias, guessing the objection. \"It's not the\r\nsame. When a man condemns others to death or destroys their\r\nfuture forever he does it with impunity and uses the strength of\r\nothers to execute his judgments, which after all may be mistaken or\r\nerroneous. But I, in exposing the criminal to the same peril that he\r\nhad prepared for others, incurred the same risk as he did. I did not\r\nkill him, but let the hand of God smite him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you don't believe in accidents?\"\r\n\r\n\"Believing in accidents is like believing in miracles; both presuppose\r\nthat God does not know the future. What is an accident? An event\r\nthat no one has at all foreseen. What is a miracle? A contradiction,\r\nan overturning of natural laws. Lack of foresight and contradiction\r\nin the Intelligence that rules the machinery of the world indicate\r\ntwo great defects.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\" Ibarra again asked with some awe.\r\n\r\n\"Have you ever studied?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have had to believe greatly in God, because I have lost faith in\r\nmen,\" answered the pilot, avoiding the question.\r\n\r\nIbarra thought he understood this hunted youth; he rejected human\r\njustice, he refused to recognize the right of man to judge his\r\nfellows, he protested against force and the superiority of some\r\nclasses over others.\r\n\r\n\"But nevertheless you must admit the necessity of human justice,\r\nhowever imperfect it may be,\" he answered. \"God, in spite of the\r\nmany ministers He may have on earth, cannot, or rather does not,\r\npronounce His judgments clearly to settle the million conflicts\r\nthat our passions excite. It is proper, it is necessary, it is just,\r\nthat man sometimes judge his fellows.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, to do good, but not to do ill, to correct and to better, but\r\nnot to destroy, for if his judgments are wrong he hasn't the power to\r\nremedy the evil he has done. But,\" he added with a change of tone,\r\n\"this discussion is beyond my powers and I'm detaining you, who are\r\nbeing waited for. Don't forget what I've just told you--you have\r\nenemies. Take care of yourself for the good of our country.\" Saying\r\nthis, he turned to go.\r\n\r\n\"When shall I see you again?\" asked Ibarra.\r\n\r\n\"Whenever you wish and always when I can be of service to you. I am\r\nstill your debtor.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nThe Dinner\r\n\r\n\r\nThere in the decorated kiosk the great men of the province were\r\ndining. The alcalde occupied one end of the table and Ibarra the\r\nother. At the young man's right sat Maria Clara and at his left\r\nthe escribano. Capitan Tiago, the alferez, the gobernadorcillo, the\r\nfriars, the employees, and the few young ladies who had remained sat,\r\nnot according to rank, but according to their inclinations. The meal\r\nwas quite animated and happy.\r\n\r\nWhen the dinner was half over, a messenger came in search of Capitan\r\nTiago with a telegram, to open which he naturally requested the\r\npermission of the others, who very naturally begged him to do so. The\r\nworthy capitan at first knitted his eyebrows, then raised them;\r\nhis face became pale, then lighted up as he hastily folded the paper\r\nand arose.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" he announced in confusion, \"his Excellency the\r\nCaptain-General is coming this evening to honor my house.\" Thereupon he\r\nset off at a run, hatless, taking with him the message and his napkin.\r\n\r\nHe was followed by exclamations and questions, for a cry of\r\n\"Tulisanes!\" would not have produced greater effect. \"But,\r\nlisten!\" \"When is he coming?\" \"Tell us about it!\" \"His Excellency!\" But\r\nCapitan Tiago was already far away.\r\n\r\n\"His Excellency is coming and will stay at Capitan Tiago's!\" exclaimed\r\nsome without taking into consideration the fact that his daughter\r\nand future son-in-law were present.\r\n\r\n\"The choice couldn't be better,\" answered the latter.\r\n\r\nThe friars gazed at one another with looks that seemed to say: \"The\r\nCaptain-General is playing another one of his tricks, he is slighting\r\nus, for he ought to stay at the convento,\" but since this was the\r\nthought of all they remained silent, none of them giving expression\r\nto it.\r\n\r\n\"I was told of this yesterday,\" said the alcalde, \"but at that time\r\nhis Excellency had not yet fully decided.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know, Señor Alcalde, how long the Captain-General thinks of\r\nstaying here?\" asked the alferez uneasily.\r\n\r\n\"With certainty, no. His Excellency likes to give surprises.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here come some more messages.\" These were for the alcalde,\r\nthe alferez, and the gobernadorcillo, and contained the same\r\nannouncement. The friars noted well that none came directed to\r\nthe curate.\r\n\r\n\"His Excellency will arrive at four this afternoon,\r\ngentlemen!\" announced the alcalde solemnly. \"So we can finish our meal\r\nin peace.\" Leonidas at Thermopylae could not have said more cheerfully,\r\n\"Tonight we shall sup with Pluto!\"\r\n\r\nThe conversation again resumed its ordinary course.\r\n\r\n\"I note the absence of our great preacher,\" timidly remarked an\r\nemployee of inoffensive aspect who had not opened his mouth up to\r\nthe time of eating, and who spoke now for the first time in the\r\nwhole morning.\r\n\r\nAll who knew the history of Crisostomo's father made a movement and\r\nwinked, as if to say, \"Get out! Fools rush in--\" But some one more\r\ncharitably disposed answered, \"He must be rather tired.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rather?\" exclaimed the alferez. \"He must be exhausted, and as they\r\nsay here, all fagged out. What a sermon it was!\"\r\n\r\n\"A splendid sermon--wonderful!\" said the escribano.\r\n\r\n\"Magnificent--profound!\" added the correspondent.\r\n\r\n\"To be able to talk so much, it's necessary to have the lungs that he\r\nhas,\" observed Padre Manuel Martin. The Augustinian did not concede\r\nhim anything more than lungs.\r\n\r\n\"And his fertility of expression!\" added Padre Salvi.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know that Señor Ibarra has the best cook in the\r\nprovince?\" remarked the alcalde, to cut short such talk.\r\n\r\n\"You may well say that, but his beautiful neighbor doesn't wish to\r\nhonor the table, for she is scarcely eating a bite,\" observed one of\r\nthe employees.\r\n\r\nMaria Clara blushed. \"I thank the gentleman, he troubles himself too\r\nmuch on my account,\" she stammered timidly, \"but--\"\r\n\r\n\"But you honor it enough merely by being present,\" concluded the\r\ngallant alcalde as he turned to Padre Salvi.\r\n\r\n\"Padre,\" he said in a loud voice, \"I've observed that during the\r\nwhole day your Reverence has been silent and thoughtful.\"\r\n\r\n\"The alcalde is a great observer,\" remarked Fray Sibyla in a meaning\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n\"It's a habit of mine,\" stammered the Franciscan. \"It pleases me more\r\nto listen than to talk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your Reverence always takes care to win and not to lose,\" said the\r\nalferez in a jesting tone.\r\n\r\nPadre Salvi, however, did not take this as a joke, for his gaze\r\nbrightened a moment as he replied, \"The alferez knows very well these\r\ndays that I'm not the one who is winning or losing most.\"\r\n\r\nThe alferez turned the hit aside with a forced laugh, pretending not\r\nto take it to himself.\r\n\r\n\"But, gentlemen, I don't understand how it is possible to talk\r\nof winnings and losses,\" interposed the alcalde. \"What will these\r\namiable and discreet young ladies who honor us with their company\r\nthink of us? For me the young women are like the Æolian harps in the\r\nmiddle of the night--it is necessary to listen with close attention\r\nin order that their ineffable harmonies may elevate the soul to the\r\ncelestial spheres of the infinite and the ideal!\"\r\n\r\n\"Your Honor is becoming poetical!\" exclaimed the escribano gleefully,\r\nand both emptied their wine-glasses.\r\n\r\n\"I can't help it,\" said the alcalde as he wiped his lips. \"Opportunity,\r\nwhile it doesn't always make the thief, makes the poet. In my youth\r\nI composed verses which were really not bad.\"\r\n\r\n\"So your Excellency has been unfaithful to the Muses to follow Themis,\"\r\nemphatically declared our mythical or mythological correspondent.\r\n\r\n\"Pshaw, what would you have? To run through the entire social scale\r\nwas always my dream. Yesterday I was gathering flowers and singing\r\nsongs, today I wield the rod of justice and serve Humanity, tomorrow--\"\r\n\r\n\"Tomorrow your Honor will throw the rod into the fire to warm yourself\r\nby it in the winter of life, and take an appointment in the cabinet,\"\r\nadded Padre Sibyla.\r\n\r\n\"Pshaw! Yes--no--to be a cabinet official isn't exactly my beau-ideal:\r\nany upstart may become one. A villa in the North in which to spend the\r\nsummer, a mansion in Madrid, and some property in Andalusia for the\r\nwinter--there we shall live remembering our beloved Philippines. Of\r\nme Voltaire would not say, 'We have lived among these people only to\r\nenrich ourselves and to calumniate them.'\"\r\n\r\nThe alcalde quoted this in French, so the employees, thinking that\r\nhis Honor had cracked a joke, began to laugh in appreciation of\r\nit. Some of the friars did likewise, since they did not know that\r\nthe Voltaire mentioned was the same Voltaire whom they had so often\r\ncursed and consigned to hell. But Padre Sibyla was aware of it and\r\nbecame serious from the belief that the alcalde had said something\r\nheretical or impious.\r\n\r\nIn the other kiosk the children were eating under the direction of\r\ntheir teacher. For Filipino children they were rather noisy, since\r\nat the table and in the presence of other persons their sins are\r\ngenerally more of omission than of commission. Perhaps one who was\r\nusing the tableware improperly would be corrected by his neighbor\r\nand from this there would arise a noisy discussion in which each\r\nwould have his partisans. Some would say the spoon, others the knife\r\nor the fork, and as no one was considered an authority there would\r\narise the contention that God is Christ or, more clearly, a dispute\r\nof theologians. Their fathers and mothers winked, made signs, nudged\r\none another, and showed their happiness by their smiles.\r\n\r\n\"Ya!\" exclaimed a countrywoman to an old man who was mashing buyo in\r\nhis _kalikut_, \"in spite of the fact that my husband is opposed to it,\r\nmy Andoy shall be a priest. It's true that we're poor, but we'll work,\r\nand if necessary we'll beg alms. There are not lacking those who will\r\ngive money so that the poor may take holy orders. Does not Brother\r\nMateo, a man who does not lie, say that Pope Sextus was a herder of\r\ncarabaos in Batangas? Well then, look at my Andoy, see if he hasn't\r\nalready the face of a St. Vincent!\" The good mother watered at the\r\nmouth to see her son take hold of a fork with both hands.\r\n\r\n\"God help us!\" added the old man, rolling his quid of buyo. \"If\r\nAndoy gets to be Pope we'll go to Rome he, he! I can still walk well,\r\nand if I die--he, he!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry, granddad! Andoy won't forget that you taught him how\r\nto weave baskets.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're right, Petra. I also believe that your son will be great, at\r\nleast a patriarch. I have never seen any one who learned the business\r\nin a shorter time. Yes, he'll remember me when as Pope or bishop he\r\nentertains himself in making baskets for his cook. He'll then say\r\nmasses for my soul--he, he!\" With this hope the good old man again\r\nfilled his _kalikut_ with buyo.\r\n\r\n\"If God hears my prayers and my hopes are fulfilled, I'll say to Andoy,\r\n'Son, take away all our sins and send us to Heaven!' Then we shan't\r\nneed to pray and fast and buy indulgences. One whose son is a blessed\r\nPope can commit sins!\"\r\n\r\n\"Send him to my house tomorrow, Petra,\" cried the old man\r\nenthusiastically, \"and I'll teach him to weave the _nito!_\"\r\n\r\n\"Huh! Get out! What are you dreaming about, grand-dad? Do you still\r\nthink that the Popes even move their hands? The curate, being nothing\r\nmore than a curate, only works in the mass--when he turns around! The\r\nArchbishop doesn't even turn around, for he says mass sitting down. So\r\nthe Pope--the Pope says it in bed with a fan! What are you thinking\r\nabout?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of nothing more, Petra, than that he know how to weave the _nito_. It\r\nwould be well for him to be able to sell hats and cigar-cases so that\r\nhe wouldn't have to beg alms, as the curate does here every year in\r\nthe name of the Pope. It always fills me with compassion to see a\r\nsaint poor, so I give all my savings.\"\r\n\r\nAnother countryman here joined in the conversation, saying, \"It's all\r\nsettled, cumare, [95] my son has got to be a doctor, there's nothing\r\nlike being a doctor!\"\r\n\r\n\"Doctor! What are you talking about, cumpare?\" retorted Petra. \"There's\r\nnothing like being a curate!\"\r\n\r\n\"A curate, pish! A curate? The doctor makes lots of money, the sick\r\npeople worship him, cumare!\"\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me! The curate, by making three or four turns and saying\r\n_deminos pabiscum_, [96] eats God and makes money. All, even the women,\r\ntell him their secrets.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the doctor? What do you think a doctor is? The doctor sees all\r\nthat the women have, he feels the pulses of the _dalagas!_ I'd just\r\nlike to be a doctor for a week!\"\r\n\r\n\"And the curate, perhaps the curate doesn't see what your doctor\r\nsees? Better still, you know the saying, 'the fattest chicken and\r\nthe roundest leg for the curate!'\"\r\n\r\n\"What of that? Do the doctors eat dried fish? Do they soil their\r\nfingers eating salt?\"\r\n\r\n\"Does the curate dirty his hands as your doctors do? He has great\r\nestates and when he works he works with music and has sacristans to\r\nhelp him.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the confessing, cumare? Isn't that work?\"\r\n\r\n\"No work about that! I'd just like to be confessing everybody! While\r\nwe work and sweat to find out what our own neighbors are doing,\r\nthe curate does nothing more than take a seat and they tell him\r\neverything. Sometimes he falls asleep, but he lets out two or three\r\nblessings and we are again the children of God! I'd just like to be\r\na curate for one evening in Lent!\"\r\n\r\n\"But the preaching? You can't tell me that it's not work. Just look\r\nhow the fat curate was sweating this morning,\" objected the rustic,\r\nwho felt himself being beaten into retreat.\r\n\r\n\"Preaching! Work to preach! Where's your judgment? I'd just like to\r\nbe talking half a day from the pulpit, scolding and quarreling with\r\neverybody, without any one daring to reply, and be getting paid for\r\nit besides. I'd just like to be the curate for one morning when those\r\nwho are in debt to me are attending mass! Look there now, how Padre\r\nDamaso gets fat with so much scolding and beating.\"\r\n\r\nPadre Damaso was, indeed, approaching with the gait of a heavy\r\nman. He was half smiling, but in such a malignant way that Ibarra,\r\nupon seeing him, lost the thread of his talk. The padre was greeted\r\nwith some surprise but with signs of pleasure on the part of all\r\nexcept Ibarra. They were then at the dessert and the champagne was\r\nfoaming in the glasses.\r\n\r\nPadre Damaso's smile became nervous when he saw Maria Clara seated\r\nat Crisostomo's right. He took a seat beside the alcalde and said in\r\nthe midst of a significant silence, \"Were you discussing something,\r\ngentlemen? Go ahead!\"\r\n\r\n\"We were at the toasts,\" answered the alcalde. \"Señor Ibarra was\r\nmentioning all who have helped him in his philanthropic enterprise\r\nand was speaking of the architect when your Reverence--\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't know anything about architecture,\" interrupted Padre\r\nDamaso, \"but I laugh at architects and the fools who employ them. Here\r\nyou have it--I drew the plan of this church and it's perfectly\r\nconstructed, so an English jeweler who stopped in the convento one\r\nday assured me. To draw a plan one needs only to have two fingers'\r\nbreadth of forehead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless,\" answered the alcalde, seeing that Ibarra was silent,\r\n\"when we consider certain buildings, as, for example, this schoolhouse,\r\nwe need an expert.\"\r\n\r\n\"Get out with your experts!\" exclaimed the priest with a sneer. \"Only\r\na fool needs experts! One must be more of a brute than the Indians,\r\nwho build their own houses, not to know how to construct four walls\r\nand put a roof on top of them. That's all a schoolhouse is!\"\r\n\r\nThe guests gazed at Ibarra, who had turned pale, but he continued as\r\nif in conversation with Maria Clara.\r\n\r\n\"But your Reverence should consider--\"\r\n\r\n\"See now,\" went on the Franciscan, not allowing the alcalde to\r\ncontinue, \"look how one of our lay brothers, the most stupid that we\r\nhave, has constructed a hospital, good, pretty, and cheap. He made\r\nthem work hard and paid only eight cuartos a day even to those who\r\nhad to come from other towns. He knew how to handle them, not like\r\na lot of cranks and little mestizos who are spoiling them by paying\r\nthree or four reals.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does your Reverence say that he paid only eight\r\ncuartos? Impossible!\" The alcalde was trying to change the course of\r\nthe conversation.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, and those who pride themselves on being good Spaniards\r\nought to imitate him. You see now, since the Suez Canal was opened,\r\nthe corruption that has come in here. Formerly, when we had to double\r\nthe Cape, neither so many vagabonds came here nor so many others went\r\nfrom here to become vagabonds.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Padre Damaso--\"\r\n\r\n\"You know well enough what the Indian is--just as soon as he gets\r\na little learning he sets himself up as a doctor! All these little\r\nfellows that go to Europe--\"\r\n\r\n\"But, listen, your Reverence!\" interrupted the alcalde, who was\r\nbecoming nervous over the aggressiveness of such talk.\r\n\r\n\"Every one ends up as he deserves,\" the friar continued. \"The hand\r\nof God is manifest in the midst of it all, and one must be blind\r\nnot to see it. Even in this life the fathers of such vipers receive\r\ntheir punishment, they die in jail ha, ha! As we might say, they\r\nhave nowhere--\"\r\n\r\nBut he did not finish the sentence. Ibarra, livid, had been following\r\nhim with his gaze and upon hearing this allusion to his father jumped\r\nup and dropped a heavy hand on the priest's head, so that he fell back\r\nstunned. The company was so filled with surprise and fright that no\r\none made any movement to interfere.\r\n\r\n\"Keep off!\" cried the youth in a terrible voice, as he caught up a\r\nsharp knife and placed his foot on the neck of the friar, who was\r\nrecovering from the shock of his fall. \"Let him who values his life\r\nkeep away!\"\r\n\r\nThe youth was beside himself. His whole body trembled and his eyes\r\nrolled threateningly in their sockets. Fray Damaso arose with an\r\neffort, but the youth caught him by the neck and shook him until he\r\nagain fell doubled over on his knees.\r\n\r\n\"Señor Ibarra! Señor Ibarra!\" stammered some. But no one, not even\r\nthe alferez himself, dared to approach the gleaming knife, when they\r\nconsidered the youth's strength and the condition of his mind. All\r\nseemed to be paralyzed.\r\n\r\n\"You, here! You have been silent, now it is my turn! I have tried to\r\navoid this, but God brings me to it--let God be the judge!\" The youth\r\nwas breathing laboriously, but with a hand of iron he held down the\r\nFranciscan, who was struggling vainly to free himself.\r\n\r\n\"My heart beats tranquilly, my hand is sure,\" he began, looking\r\naround him. \"First, is there one among you, one who has not loved his\r\nfather, who was born in such shame and humiliation that he hates his\r\nmemory? You see? You understand this silence? Priest of a God of peace,\r\nwith your mouth full of sanctity and religion and your heart full of\r\nevil, you cannot know what a father is, or you might have thought of\r\nyour own! In all this crowd which you despise there is not one like\r\nyou! You are condemned!\"\r\n\r\nThe persons surrounding him, thinking that he was about to commit\r\nmurder, made a movement.\r\n\r\n\"Away!\" he cried again in a threatening voice. \"What, do you fear that\r\nI shall stain my hands with impure blood? Have I not told you that\r\nmy heart beats tranquilly? Away from us! Listen, priests and judges,\r\nyou who think yourselves other men and attribute to yourselves other\r\nrights: my father was an honorable man,--ask these people here, who\r\nvenerate his memory. My father was a good citizen and he sacrificed\r\nhimself for me and for the good of his country. His house was open\r\nand his table was set for the stranger and the outcast who came to\r\nhim in distress! He was a Christian who always did good and who never\r\noppressed the unprotected or afflicted those in trouble. To this man\r\nhere he opened his doors, he made him sit at his table and called\r\nhim his friend. And how has this man repaid him? He calumniated him,\r\npersecuted him, raised up against him all the ignorant by availing\r\nhimself of the sanctity of his position; he outraged his tomb,\r\ndishonored his memory, and persecuted him even in the sleep of\r\ndeath! Not satisfied with this, he persecutes the son now! I have\r\nfled from him, I have avoided his presence. You this morning heard\r\nhim profane the pulpit, pointing me out to popular fanaticism, and I\r\nheld my peace! Now he comes here to seek a quarrel with me. To your\r\nsurprise, I have suffered in silence, but he again insults the most\r\nsacred memory that there is for a son. You who are here, priests and\r\njudges, have you seen your aged father wear himself out working for\r\nyou, separating himself from you for your welfare, have you seen him\r\ndie of sorrow in a prison sighing for your embrace, seeking some one\r\nto comfort him, alone, sick, when you were in a foreign land? Have you\r\nafterwards heard his name dishonored, have you found his tomb empty\r\nwhen you went to pray beside it? No? You are silent, you condemn him!\"\r\n\r\nHe raised his hand, but with the swiftness of light a girlish form\r\nput itself between them and delicate fingers restrained the avenging\r\narm. It was Maria Clara. Ibarra stared at her with a look that seemed\r\nto reflect madness. Slowly his clenched fingers relaxed, letting\r\nfall the body of the Franciscan and the knife. Covering his face,\r\nhe fled through the crowd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n\r\nNews of the incident soon spread throughout the town. At first all\r\nwere incredulous, but, having to yield to the fact, they broke out\r\ninto exclamations of surprise. Each one, according to his moral lights,\r\nmade his comments.\r\n\r\n\"Padre Damaso is dead,\" said some. \"When they picked him up his face\r\nwas covered with blood and he wasn't breathing.\"\r\n\r\n\"May he rest in peace! But he hasn't any more than settled his\r\ndebts!\" exclaimed a young man. \"Look what he did this morning in the\r\nconvento--there isn't any name for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did he do? Did he beat up the coadjutor again?\"\r\n\r\n\"What did he do? Tell us about it!\"\r\n\r\n\"You saw that Spanish mestizo go out through the sacristy in the\r\nmidst of the sermon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we saw him. Padre Damaso took note of him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, after the sermon he sent for the young man and asked him why he\r\nhad gone out. 'I don't understand Tagalog, Padre,' was the reply. 'And\r\nwhy did you joke about it, saying that it was Greek?' yelled Padre\r\nDamaso, slapping the young man in the face. The latter retorted and\r\nthe two came to blows until they were separated.\"\r\n\r\n\"If that had happened to me--\" hissed a student between his teeth.\r\n\r\n\"I don't approve of the action of the Franciscan,\" said another,\r\n\"since Religion ought not to be imposed on any one as a punishment\r\nor a penance. But I am almost glad of it, for I know that young man,\r\nI know that he's from San Pedro Makati and that he talks Tagalog\r\nwell. Now he wants to be taken for a recent arrival from Russia and\r\nprides himself on appearing not to know the language of his fathers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then God makes them and they rush together!\" [97]\r\n\r\n\"Still we must protest against such actions,\" exclaimed another\r\nstudent. \"To remain silent would be to assent to the abuse, and what\r\nhas happened may be repeated with any one of us. We're going back to\r\nthe times of Nero!\"\r\n\r\n\"You're wrong,\" replied another. \"Nero was a great artist, while\r\nPadre Damaso is only a tiresome preacher.\"\r\n\r\nThe comments of the older persons were of a different kind. While\r\nthey were waiting for the arrival of the Captain-General in a hut\r\noutside the town, the gobernadorcillo was saying, \"To tell who was\r\nright and who was wrong, is not an easy matter. Yet if Señor Ibarra\r\nhad used more prudence--\"\r\n\r\n\"If Padre Damaso had used half the prudence of Señor Ibarra, you mean\r\nto say, perhaps!\" interrupted Don Filipo. \"The bad thing about it is\r\nthat they exchanged parts--the youth conducted himself like an old\r\nman and the old man like a youth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you say that no one moved, no one went near to separate them,\r\nexcept Capitan Tiago's daughter?\" asked Capitan Martin. \"None of the\r\nfriars, nor the alcalde? Ahem! Worse and worse! I shouldn't like to\r\nbe in that young man's skin. No one will forgive him for having been\r\nafraid of him. Worse and worse, ahem!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think so?\" asked Capitan Basilio curiously.\r\n\r\n\"I hope,\" said Don Filipo, exchanging a look with the latter, \"that\r\nthe people won't desert him. We must keep in mind what his family\r\nhas done and what he is trying to do now. And if, as may happen,\r\nthe people, being intimidated, are silent, his friends--\"\r\n\r\n\"But, gentlemen,\" interrupted the gobernadorcillo, \"what can we\r\ndo? What can the people do? Happen what will, the friars are always\r\nright!\"\r\n\r\n\"They are _always_ right because we _always_ allow them to be,\"\r\nanswered Don Filipo impatiently, putting double stress on the\r\nitalicized word. \"Let us be right once and then we'll talk.\"\r\n\r\nThe gobernadorcillo scratched his head and stared at the roof while he\r\nreplied in a sour tone, \"Ay! the heat of the blood! You don't seem to\r\nrealize yet what country we're in, you don't know your countrymen. The\r\nfriars are rich and united, while we are divided and poor. Yes, try\r\nto defend yourself and you'll see how the people will leave you in\r\nthe lurch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\" exclaimed Don Filipo bitterly. \"That will happen as long as\r\nyou think that way, as long as fear and prudence are synonyms. More\r\nattention is paid to a possible evil than to a necessary good. At\r\nonce fear, and not confidence, presents itself; each one thinks only\r\nof himself, no one thinks of the rest, and therefore we are all weak!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well then, think of others before yourself and you'll see how they'll\r\nleave you in the lurch. Don't you know the proverb, 'Charity begins\r\nat home'?\"\r\n\r\n\"You had better say,\" replied the exasperated teniente-mayor, \"that\r\ncowardice begins in selfishness and ends in shame! This very day I'm\r\ngoing to hand in my resignation to the alcalde. I'm tired of passing\r\nfor a joke without being useful to anybody. Good-by!\"\r\n\r\nThe women had opinions of still another kind.\r\n\r\n\"Ay_!_\" sighed one woman of kindly expression. \"The young men are\r\nalways so! If his good mother were alive, what would she say? When I\r\nthink that the like may happen to my son, who has a violent temper,\r\nI almost envy his dead mother. I should die of grief!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I shouldn't,\" replied another. \"It wouldn't cause me any shame\r\nif such a thing should happen to my two sons.\"\r\n\r\n \"What are you saying, Capitana Maria!\" exclaimed the first, clasping\r\n her hands.\r\n\r\n\"It pleases me to see a son defend the memory of his parents, Capitana\r\nTinay. What would you say if some day when you were a widow you heard\r\nyour husband spoken ill of and your son Antonio should hang his head\r\nand remain silent?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would deny him my blessing!\" exclaimed a third, Sister Rufa, \"but--\"\r\n\r\n\"Deny him my blessing, never!\" interrupted the kind Capitana Tinay. \"A\r\nmother ought not to say that! But I don't know what I should do--I\r\ndon't know--I believe I'd die--but I shouldn't want to see him\r\nagain. But what do you think about it, Capitana Maria?\"\r\n\r\n\"After all,\" added Sister Rufa, \"it must not be forgotten that it's\r\na great sin to place your hand on a sacred person.\"\r\n\r\n\"A father's memory is more sacred!\" replied Capitana Maria. \"No one,\r\nnot even the Pope himself, much less Padre Damaso, may profane such\r\na holy memory.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's true!\" murmured Capitana Tinay, admiring the wisdom of\r\nboth. \"Where did you get such good ideas?\"\r\n\r\n\"But the excommunication and the condemnation?\" exclaimed Sister\r\nRufa. \"What are honor and a good name in this life if in the other we\r\nare damned? Everything passes away quickly--but the excommunication--to\r\noutrage a minister of Christ! No one less than the Pope can pardon\r\nthat!\"\r\n\r\n\"God, who commands honor for father and mother, will pardon it,\r\nGod will not excommunicate him! And I tell you that if that young\r\nman comes to my house I will receive him and talk with him, and if\r\nI had a daughter I would want him for a son-in-law; he who is a good\r\nson will be a good husband and a good father--believe it, Sister Rufa!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't think so. Say what you like, and even though you may\r\nappear to be right, I'll always rather believe the curate. Before\r\neverything else, I'll save my soul. What do you say, Capitana Tinny?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, what do you want me to say? You're both right the curate is\r\nright, but God must also be right. I don't know, I'm only a foolish\r\nwoman. What I'm going to do is to tell my son not to study any more,\r\nfor they say that persons who know anything die on the gallows. _María\r\nSantísima_, my son wants to go to Europe!\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you thinking of doing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell him to stay with me--why should he know more? Tomorrow or the\r\nnext day we shall die, the learned and the ignorant alike must die,\r\nand the only question is to live in peace.\" The good old woman sighed\r\nand raised her eyes toward the sky.\r\n\r\n\"For my part,\" said Capitana Maria gravely, \"if I were rich like\r\nyou I would let my sons travel; they are young and will some day be\r\nmen. I have only a little while to live, we should see one another in\r\nthe other life, so sons should aspire to be more than their fathers,\r\nbut at our sides we only teach them to be children.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, what rare thoughts you have!\" exclaimed the astonished Capitana\r\nTinay, clasping her hands. \"It must be that you didn't suffer in\r\nbearing your twin boys.\"\r\n\r\n\"For the very reason that I did bear them with suffering, that I have\r\nnurtured and reared them in spite of our poverty, I do not wish that,\r\nafter the trouble they're cost me, they be only half-men.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me that you don't love your children as God commands,\"\r\nsaid Sister Rufa in a rather severe tone.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, every mother loves her sons in her own way. One mother\r\nloves them for her own sake and another loves them for their sake. I\r\nam one of the latter, for my husband has so taught me.\"\r\n\r\n\"All your ideas, Capitana Maria,\" said Sister Rufa, as if preaching,\r\n\"are but little religious. Become a sister of the Holy Rosary or of\r\nSt. Francis or of St. Rita or of St. Clara.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sister Rufa, when I am a worthy sister of men then I'll try to be\r\na sister of the saints,\" she answered with a smile.\r\n\r\nTo put an end to this chapter of comments and that the reader\r\nmay learn in passing what the simple country folk thought of the\r\nincident, we will now go to the plaza, where under the large awning\r\nsome rustics are conversing, one of them--he who dreamed about doctors\r\nof medicine--being an acquaintance of ours.\r\n\r\n\"What I regret most,\" said he, \"is that the schoolhouse won't be\r\nfinished.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" asked the bystanders with interest.\r\n\r\n\"My son won't be a doctor but a carter, nothing more! Now there won't\r\nbe any school!\"\r\n\r\n\"Who says there won't be any school?\" asked a rough and robust\r\ncountryman with wide cheeks and a narrow head.\r\n\r\n\"I do! The white padres have called Don Crisostomo _plibastiero_. [98]\r\nNow there won't be any school.\"\r\n\r\nAll stood looking questioningly at each other; that was a new term\r\nto them.\r\n\r\n\"And is that a bad name?\" the rough countryman made bold to ask.\r\n\r\n\"The worst thing that one Christian can say to another!\"\r\n\r\n\"Worse than _tarantado_ and _sarayate?\"_ [99]\r\n\r\n\"If it were only that! I've been called those names several times\r\nand they didn't even give me a bellyache.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it can't be worse than '_indio,_' as the alferez says.\"\r\n\r\nThe man who was to have a carter for a son became gloomier, while\r\nthe other scratched his head in thought.\r\n\r\n\"Then it must be like the _betelapora_ [100] that the alferez's old\r\nwoman says. Worse than that is to spit on the Host.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's worse than to spit on the Host on Good Friday,\" was the\r\ngrave reply. \"You remember the word _ispichoso_ [101] which when\r\napplied to a man is enough to have the civil-guards take him into\r\nexile or put him in jail well, _plibustiero_ is much worse. According\r\nto what the telegrapher and the directorcillo said, _plibustiero_,\r\nsaid by a Christian, a curate, or a Spaniard to another Christian like\r\nus is a _santusdeus with requimiternam_, [102] for if they ever call\r\nyou a _plibustiero_ then you'd better get yourself shriven and pay\r\nyour debts, since nothing remains for you but to be hanged. You know\r\nwhether the telegrapher and the directorcillo ought to be informed;\r\none talks with wires and the other knows Spanish and works only with\r\na pen.\" All were appalled.\r\n\r\n\"May they force me to wear shoes and in all my life to drink nothing\r\nbut that vile stuff they call beer, if I ever let myself be called\r\n_pelbistero!_\" swore the countryman, clenching his fists. \"What,\r\nrich as Don Crisostomo is, knowing Spanish as he does, and able to\r\neat fast with a knife and spoon, I'd laugh at five curates!\"\r\n\r\n\"The next civil-guard I catch stealing my chickens I'm going to call\r\n_palabistiero_, then I'll go to confession at once,\" murmured one of\r\nthe rustics in a low voice as he withdrew from the group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\nThe First Cloud\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Capitan Tiago's house reigned no less disorder than in the people's\r\nimagination. Maria Clara did nothing but weep and would not listen to\r\nthe consoling words of her aunt and of Andeng, her foster-sister. Her\r\nfather had forbidden her to speak to Ibarra until the priests should\r\nabsolve him from the excommunication. Capitan Tiago himself, in the\r\nmidst of his preparations for receiving the Captain-General properly,\r\nhad been summoned to the convento.\r\n\r\n\"Don't cry, daughter,\" said Aunt Isabel, as she polished the bright\r\nplates of the mirrors with a piece of chamois. \"They'll withdraw the\r\nexcommunication, they'll write now to the Pope, and we'll make a big\r\npoor-offering. Padre Damaso only fainted, he's not dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't cry,\" whispered Andeng. \"I'll manage it so that you may talk\r\nwith him. What are confessionals for if not that we may sin? Everything\r\nis forgiven by telling it to the curate.\"\r\n\r\nAt length Capitan Tiago returned. They sought in his face the answer\r\nto many questions, and it announced discouragement. The poor fellow\r\nwas perspiring; he rubbed his hand across his forehead, but was unable\r\nto say a single word.\r\n\r\n\"What has happened, Santiago?\" asked Aunt Isabel anxiously.\r\n\r\nHe answered by sighing and wiping away a tear.\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake, speak! What has happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just what I feared,\" he broke out at last, half in tears. \"All is\r\nlost! Padre Damaso has ordered me to break the engagement, otherwise\r\nhe will damn me in this life and in the next. All of them told me\r\nthe same, even Padre Sibyla. I must close the doors of my house\r\nagainst him, and I owe him over fifty thousand pesos! I told the\r\npadres this, but they refused to take any notice of it. 'Which do\r\nyou prefer to lose,' they asked me, 'fifty thousand pesos or your\r\nlife and your soul?' Ay, St. Anthony, if I had only known, if I had\r\nonly known! Don't cry, daughter,\" he went on, turning to the sobbing\r\ngirl. \"You're not like your mother, who never cried except just before\r\nyou were born. Padre Damaso told me that a relative of his has just\r\narrived from Spain and you are to marry him.\"\r\n\r\nMaria Clara covered her ears, while Aunt Isabel screamed, \"Santiago,\r\nare you crazy? To talk to her of another sweetheart now! Do you think\r\nthat your daughter changes sweethearts as she does her camisa?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's just the way I felt, Isabel. Don Crisostomo is rich, while\r\nthe Spaniards marry only for love of money. But what do you want me\r\nto do? They've threatened me with another excommunication. They say\r\nthat not only my soul but also my body is in great danger--my body,\r\ndo you hear, my body!\"\r\n\r\n\"But you're only making your daughter more disconsolate! Isn't the\r\nArchbishop your friend? Why don't you write to him?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Archbishop is also a friar, the Archbishop does only what the\r\nfriars tell him to do. But, Maria, don't cry. The Captain-General\r\nis coming, he'll want to see you, and your eyes are all red. Ay,\r\nI was thinking to spend a happy evening! Without this misfortune\r\nI should be the happiest of men--every one would envy me! Be calm,\r\nmy child, I'm more unfortunate than you and I'm not crying. You can\r\nhave another and better husband, while I--I've lost fifty thousand\r\npesos! Ay, Virgin of Antipolo, if tonight I may only have luck!\"\r\n\r\nSalvos, the sound of carriage wheels, the galloping of horses,\r\nand a band playing the royal march, announced the arrival of his\r\nExcellency, the Captain-General of the Philippines. Maria Clara\r\nran to hide herself in her chamber. Poor child, rough hands that\r\nknew not its delicate chords were playing with her heart! While\r\nthe house became filled with people and heavy steps, commanding\r\nvoices, and the clank of sabers and spurs resounded on all sides,\r\nthe afflicted maiden reclined half-kneeling before a picture of the\r\nVirgin represented in that sorrowful loneliness perceived only by\r\nDelaroche, as if he had surprised her returning from the sepulcher of\r\nher Son. But Maria Clara was not thinking of that mother's sorrow,\r\nshe was thinking of her own. With her head hanging down over her\r\nbreast and her hands resting on the floor she made the picture of a\r\nlily bent by the storm. A future dreamed of and cherished for years,\r\nwhose illusions, born in infancy and grown strong throughout youth,\r\nhad given form to the very fibers of her being, to be wiped away now\r\nfrom her mind and heart by a single word! It was enough to stop the\r\nbeating of one and to deprive the other of reason.\r\n\r\nMaria Clara was a loving daughter as well as a good and pious\r\nChristian, so it was not the excommunication alone that terrified her,\r\nbut the command and the ominous calmness of her father demanding the\r\nsacrifice of her love. Now she felt the whole force of that affection\r\nwhich until this moment she had hardly suspected. It had been like\r\na river gliding along peacefully with its banks carpeted by fragrant\r\nflowers and its bed covered with fine sand, so that the wind hardly\r\nruffled its current as it moved along, seeming hardly to flow at all;\r\nbut suddenly its bed becomes narrower, sharp stones block the way,\r\nhoary logs fall across it forming a barrier--then the stream rises\r\nand roars with its waves boiling and scattering clouds of foam,\r\nit beats against the rocks and rushes into the abyss!\r\n\r\nShe wanted to pray, but who in despair can pray? Prayers are for the\r\nhours of hope, and when in the absence of this we turn to God it is\r\nonly with complaints. \"My God,\" cried her heart, \"why dost Thou thus\r\ncut a man off, why dost Thou deny him the love of others? Thou dost\r\nnot deny him thy sunlight and thy air nor hide from him the sight of\r\nthy heaven! Why then deny him love, for without a sight of the sky,\r\nwithout air or sunlight, one can live, but without love--never!\"\r\n\r\nWould these cries unheard by men reach the throne of God or be heard\r\nby the Mother of the distressed? The poor maiden who had never known\r\na mother dared to confide these sorrows of an earthly love to that\r\npure heart that knew only the love of daughter and of mother. In\r\nher despair she turned to that deified image of womanhood, the most\r\nbeautiful idealization of the most ideal of all creatures, to that\r\npoetical creation of Christianity who unites in herself the two most\r\nbeautiful phases of womanhood without its sorrows: those of virgin\r\nand mother,--to her whom we call Mary!\r\n\r\n\"Mother, mother!\" she moaned.\r\n\r\nAunt Isabel came to tear her away from her sorrow since she was being\r\nasked for by some friends and by the Captain-General, who wished to\r\ntalk with her.\r\n\r\n\"Aunt, tell them that I'm ill,\" begged the frightened girl. \"They're\r\ngoing to make me play on the piano and sing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your father has promised. Are you going to put your father in a\r\nbad light?\"\r\n\r\nMaria Clara rose, looked at her aunt, and threw back her shapely arms,\r\nmurmuring, \"Oh, if I only had--\"\r\n\r\nBut without concluding the phrase she began to make herself ready\r\nfor presentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\nHis Excellency\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I Want to talk with that young man,\" said his Excellency to an\r\naide. \"He has aroused all my interest.\"\r\n\r\n\"They have already gone to look for him, General. But here is a young\r\nman from Manila who insists on being introduced. We told him that\r\nyour Excellency had no time for interviews, that you had not come\r\nto give audiences, but to see the town and the procession, and he\r\nanswered that your Excellency always has time to dispense justice--\"\r\n\r\nHis Excellency turned to the alcalde in wonder. \"If I am not mistaken,\"\r\nsaid the latter with a slight bow, \"he is the young man who this\r\nmorning had a quarrel with Padre Damaso over the sermon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still another? Has this friar set himself to stir up the whole\r\nprovince or does he think that he governs here? Show the young man\r\nin.\" His Excellency paced nervously from one end of the sala to\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nIn the hall were gathered various Spaniards mingled with soldiers\r\nand officials of San Diego and neighboring towns, standing in groups\r\nconversing or disputing. There were also to be seen all the friars,\r\nwith the exception of Padre Damaso, and they wanted to go in to pay\r\ntheir respects to his Excellency.\r\n\r\n\"His Excellency the Captain-General begs your Reverences to wait a\r\nmoment,\" said the aide. \"Come in, young man!\" The Manilan who had\r\nconfounded Greek with Tagalog entered the room pale and trembling.\r\n\r\nAll were filled with surprise; surely his Excellency must be greatly\r\nirritated to dare to make the friars wait! Padre Sibyla remarked,\r\n\"I haven't anything to say to him, I'm wasting my time here.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say the same,\" added an Augustinian. \"Shall we go?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wouldn't it be better that we find out how he stands?\" asked Padre\r\nSalvi. \"We should avoid a scandal, and should be able to remind him\r\nof his duties toward--religion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your Reverences may enter, if you so desire,\" said the aide as\r\nhe ushered out the youth who did not understand Greek and whose\r\ncountenance was now beaming with satisfaction.\r\n\r\nFray Sibyla entered first, Padre Salvi, Padre Martin, and the other\r\npriests following. They all made respectful bows with the exception\r\nof Padre Sibyla, who even in bending preserved a certain air of\r\nsuperiority. Padre Salvi on the other hand almost doubled himself\r\nover the girdle.\r\n\r\n\"Which of your Reverences is Padre Damaso?\" asked the Captain-General\r\nwithout any preliminary greeting, neither asking them to be seated nor\r\ninquiring about their health nor addressing them with the flattering\r\nspeeches to which such important personages are accustomed.\r\n\r\n\"Padre Damaso is not here among us, sir,\" replied Fray Sibyla in the\r\nsame dry tone as that used by his Excellency.\r\n\r\n\"Your Excellency's servant is in bed sick,\" added Padre Salvi\r\nhumbly. \"After having the pleasure of welcoming you and of informing\r\nourselves concerning your Excellency's health, as is the duty of all\r\ngood subjects of the King and of every person of culture, we have\r\ncome in the name of the respected servant of your Excellency who has\r\nhad the misfortune--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" interrupted the Captain-General, twirling a chair about on one\r\nleg and smiling nervously, \"if all the servants of my Excellency were\r\nlike his Reverence, Padre Damaso, I should prefer myself to serve\r\nmy Excellency!\"\r\n\r\nThe reverend gentlemen, who were standing up physically, did so\r\nmentally at this interruption.\r\n\r\n\"Won't your Reverences be seated?\" he added after a brief pause,\r\nmoderating his tone a little.\r\n\r\nCapitan Tiago here appeared in full dress, walking on tiptoe and\r\nleading by the hand Maria Clara, who entered timidly and with\r\nhesitation. Still she bowed gracefully and ceremoniously.\r\n\r\n\"Is this young lady your daughter?\" asked the Captain-General in\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n\"And your Excellency's, General,\" answered Capitan Tiago\r\nseriously. [103]\r\n\r\nThe alcalde and the aides opened their eyes wide, but his Excellency\r\nlost none of his gravity as he took the girl's hand and said affably,\r\n\"Happy are the fathers who have daughters like you, señorita! I have\r\nheard you spoken of with respect and admiration and have wanted to\r\nsee you and thank you for your beautiful action of this afternoon. I\r\nam informed of _everything_ and when I make my report to his Majesty's\r\ngovernment I shall not forget your noble conduct. Meanwhile, permit me\r\nto thank you in the name of his Majesty, the King, whom I represent\r\nhere and who loves _peace and tranquillity_ in his loyal subjects,\r\nand for myself, a father who has daughters of your age, and to propose\r\na reward for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir--\" answered the trembling Maria Clara.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency guessed what she wanted to say, and so continued:\r\n\"It is well, señorita, that you are at peace with your conscience and\r\ncontent with the good opinion of your fellow-countrymen, with the\r\nfaith which is its own best reward and beyond which we should not\r\naspire. But you must not deprive me of an opportunity to show that\r\nif Justice knows how to punish she also knows how to reward and that\r\nshe is not always _blind!_\" The italicized words were all spoken in\r\na loud and significant tone.\r\n\r\n\"Señor Don Juan Crisostomo Ibarra awaits the orders of your\r\nExcellency!\" announced the aide in a loud voice.\r\n\r\nMaria Clara shuddered.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed the Captain-General. \"Allow me, señorita, to express\r\nmy desire to see you again before leaving the town, as I still have\r\nsome very important things to say to you. Señor Alcalde, you will\r\naccompany me during the walk which I wish to take after the conference\r\nthat I will hold alone with Señor Ibarra.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your Excellency will permit us to inform you,\" began Padre Salvi\r\nhumbly, \"that Señor Ibarra is excommunicated.\"\r\n\r\nHis Excellency cut short this speech, saying, \"I am happy that I have\r\nonly to regret the condition of Padre Damaso, for whom I _sincerely_\r\ndesire a _complete_ recovery, since at his age _a voyage to Spain_\r\non account of his health may not be very agreeable. But that depends\r\non him! Meanwhile, may God preserve the health of your Reverences!\"\r\n\r\n\"And so much depends on him,\" murmured Padre Salvi as they\r\nretired. \"We'll see who makes that voyage soonest!\" remarked another\r\nFranciscan.\r\n\r\n\"I shall leave at once,\" declared the indignant Padre Sibyla.\r\n\r\n\"And we shall go back to our province,\" said the Augustinians. Neither\r\nthe Dominican nor the Augustinians could endure the thought that they\r\nhad been so coldly received on a Franciscan's account.\r\n\r\nIn the hall they met Ibarra, their amphitryon of a few hours before,\r\nbut no greetings were exchanged, only looks that said many things. But\r\nwhen the friars had withdrawn the alcalde greeted him familiarly,\r\nalthough the entrance of the aide looking for the young man left\r\nno time for conversation. In the doorway he met Maria Clara; their\r\nlooks also said many things but quite different from what the friars'\r\neyes had expressed.\r\n\r\nIbarra was dressed in deep mourning, but presented himself serenely\r\nand made a profound bow, even though the visit of the friars had not\r\nappeared to him to be a good augury. The Captain-General advanced\r\ntoward him several steps.\r\n\r\n\"I take pleasure, Señor Ibarra, in shaking your hand. Permit me to\r\nreceive you in all confidence.\" His Excellency examined the youth\r\nwith marked satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, such kindness--\"\r\n\r\n\"Your surprise offends me, signifying as it does that you had not\r\nexpected to be well received. That is casting a doubt on my sense\r\nof justice!\"\r\n\r\n\"A cordial reception, sir, for an insignificant subject of his Majesty\r\nlike myself is not justice but a favor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good, good,\" exclaimed his Excellency, seating himself and waving\r\nIbarra to a chair. \"Let us enjoy a brief period of frankness. I am\r\nvery well satisfied with your conduct and have already recommended\r\nyou to his Majesty for a decoration on account of your philanthropic\r\nidea of erecting a schoolhouse. If you had let me know, I would have\r\nattended the ceremony with pleasure, and perhaps might have prevented\r\na disagreeable incident.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seemed to me such a small matter,\" answered the youth, \"that I\r\ndid not think it worth while troubling your Excellency with it in the\r\nmidst of your numerous cares. Besides, my duty was to apply first to\r\nthe chief authority of my province.\"\r\n\r\nHis Excellency nodded with a satisfied air and went on in an even more\r\nfamiliar tone: \"In regard to the trouble you're had with Padre Damaso,\r\ndon't hold any fear or rancor, for they won't touch a hair of your head\r\nwhile I govern the islands. As for the excommunication, I'll speak\r\nto the Archbishop, since it is necessary for us to adjust ourselves\r\nto circumstances. Here we can't laugh at such things in public as we\r\ncan in the Peninsula and in enlightened Europe. Nevertheless, be more\r\nprudent in the future. You have placed yourself in opposition to the\r\nreligious orders, who must be respected on account of their influence\r\nand their wealth. But I will protect you, for I like good sons,\r\nI like to see them honor the memory of their fathers. I loved mine,\r\nand, as God lives, I don't know what I would have done in your place!\"\r\n\r\nThen, changing the subject of conversation quickly, he asked, \"I'm\r\ntold that you have just returned from Europe; were you in Madrid?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, several months.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you heard my family spoken of?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your Excellency had just left when I had the honor of being introduced\r\nto your family.\"\r\n\r\n\"How is it, then, that you came without bringing any recommendations\r\nto me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" replied Ibarra with a bow, \"because I did not come direct from\r\nSpain and because I have heard your Excellency so well spoken of that\r\nI thought a letter of recommendation might not only be valueless but\r\neven offensive; all Filipinos are recommended to you.\"\r\n\r\nA smile played about the old soldier's lips and he replied slowly, as\r\nthough measuring and weighing his words, \"You flatter me by thinking\r\nso, and--so it ought to be. Nevertheless, young man, you must know\r\nwhat burdens weigh upon our shoulders here in the Philippines. Here\r\nwe, old soldiers, have to do and to be everything: King, Minister of\r\nState, of War, of Justice, of Finance, of Agriculture, and of all\r\nthe rest. The worst part of it too is that in every matter we have\r\nto consult the distant mother country, which accepts or rejects our\r\nproposals according to circumstances there--and at times blindly. As we\r\nSpaniards say, 'He who attempts many things succeeds in none.' Besides,\r\nwe generally come here knowing little about the country and leave\r\nit when we begin to get acquainted with it. With you I can be frank,\r\nfor it would be useless to try to be otherwise. Even in Spain, where\r\neach department has its own minister, born and reared in the locality,\r\nwhere there are a press and a public opinion, where the opposition\r\nfrankly opens the eyes of the government and keeps it informed,\r\neverything moves along imperfectly and defectively; thus it is a\r\nmiracle that here things are not completely topsyturvy in the lack\r\nof these safeguards, and having to live and work under the shadow\r\nof a most powerful opposition. Good intentions are not lacking to\r\nus, the governing powers, but we find ourselves obliged to avail\r\nourselves of the eyes and arms of others whom ordinarily we do not\r\nknow and who perhaps, instead of serving their country, serve only\r\ntheir own private interests. This is not our fault but the fault\r\nof circumstances--the friars aid us not a little in getting along,\r\nbut they are not sufficient. You have aroused my interest and it is\r\nmy desire that the imperfections of our present system of government\r\nbe of no hindrance to you. I cannot look after everybody nor can\r\neverybody come to me. Can I be of service to you in any way? Have\r\nyou no request to make?\"\r\n\r\nIbarra reflected a moment before he answered. \"Sir, my dearest wish\r\nis the happiness of my country, a happiness which I desire to see\r\nowed to the mother country and to the efforts of my fellow-citizens,\r\nthe two united by the eternal bonds of common aspirations and common\r\ninterests. What I would request can only be given by the government\r\nafter years of unceasing toil and after the introduction of definite\r\nreforms.\"\r\n\r\nHis Excellency gazed at him for a few seconds with a searching look,\r\nwhich Ibarra sustained with naturalness. \"You are the first man that\r\nI've talked to in this country!\" he finally exclaimed, extending\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\n\"Your Excellency has seen only those who drag themselves about in the\r\ncity; you have not visited the slandered huts of our towns or your\r\nExcellency would have been able to see real men, if to be a man it\r\nis sufficient to have a generous heart and simple customs.\"\r\n\r\nThe Captain-General rose and began to walk back and forth in the\r\nroom. \"Señor Ibarra,\" he exclaimed, pausing suddenly, and the young man\r\nalso rose, \"perhaps within a month I shall leave. Your education and\r\nyour mode of thinking are not for this country. Sell what you have,\r\npack your trunk, and come with me to Europe; the climate there will\r\nbe more agreeable to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall always while I live preserve the memory of your Excellency's\r\nkindness,\" replied Ibarra with emotion, \"but I must remain in this\r\ncountry where my fathers have lived.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where they have died you might say with more exactness! Believe\r\nme, perhaps I know your country better than you yourself do. Ah,\r\nnow I remember,\" he exclaimed with a change of tone, \"you are going\r\nto marry an adorable young woman and I'm detaining you here! Go, go\r\nto her, and that you may have greater freedom send her father to me,\"\r\nthis with a smile. \"Don't forget, though, that I want you to accompany\r\nme in my walk.\"\r\n\r\nIbarra bowed and withdrew. His Excellency then called to his\r\naide. \"I'm satisfied,\" he said, slapping the latter lightly on the\r\nshoulder. \"Today I've seen for the first time how it is possible for\r\none to be a good Spaniard without ceasing to be a good Filipino and\r\nto love his country. Today I showed their Reverences that we are not\r\nall puppets of theirs. This young man gave me the opportunity and I\r\nshall soon have settled all my accounts with the friars. It's a pity\r\nthat some day or other this young man--But call the alcalde.\"\r\n\r\nThe alcalde presented himself immediately. As he entered, the\r\nCaptain-General said to him, \"Señor Alcalde, in order to avoid any\r\nrepetition of _scenes_ such as you _witnessed_ this afternoon, scenes\r\nthat I regret, as they _hurt the prestige_ of the government and of\r\nall good Spaniards, allow me to recommend to your _especial_ care\r\nSeñor Ibarra, so that you may afford him means for carrying out his\r\npatriotic intentions and also that in the future you prevent his being\r\nmolested by persons of any class whatsoever, under any pretext at all.\"\r\n\r\nThe alcalde understood the reprimand and bowed to conceal his\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\n\"Have the same order communicated to the alferez who commands in the\r\ndistrict here. Also, investigate whether that gentleman has affairs\r\nof his own that are not sanctioned by the regulations. I've heard\r\nmore than one complaint in regard to that.\"\r\n\r\nCapitan Tiago presented himself stiff and formal. \"Don Santiago,\" said\r\nhis Excellency in an affable tone, \"a little while ago I felicitated\r\nyou on the happiness of having a daughter such as the Señorita de los\r\nSantos; now let me congratulate you on your future son-in-law. The\r\nmost virtuous of daughters is certainly worthy of the best citizen of\r\nthe Philippines. Is it permitted to know when the wedding will occur?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir!\" stammered Capitan Tiago, wiping the perspiration from his\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\n\"Come now, I see that there is nothing definitely arranged. If persons\r\nare lacking to stand up with them, I shall take the greatest pleasure\r\nin being one of them. That's for the purpose of ridding myself of the\r\nfeeling of disgust which the many weddings I've heretofore taken part\r\nin have given me,\" he added, turning to the alcalde.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" answered Capitan Tiago with a smile that would move\r\nto pity.\r\n\r\nIbarra almost ran in search of Maria Clara--he had so many things\r\nto tell her. Hearing merry voices in one of the rooms, he knocked\r\nlightly on the door.\r\n\r\n\"Who's there?\" asked the voice of Maria Clara.\r\n\r\n\"I!\"\r\n\r\nThe voices became hushed and the door--did not open.\r\n\r\n\"It's I, may I come in?\" called the young man, his heart beating\r\nviolently.\r\n\r\nThe silence continued. Then light footsteps approached the door and the\r\nmerry voice of Sinang murmured through the keyhole, \"Crisostomo, we're\r\ngoing to the theater tonight. Write what you have to say to Maria.\"\r\n\r\nThe footsteps retreated again as rapidly as they approached.\r\n\r\n\"What does this mean?\" murmured Ibarra thoughtfully as he retired\r\nslowly from the door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\nThe Procession\r\n\r\n\r\nAt nightfall, when all the lanterns in the windows had been lighted,\r\nfor the fourth time the procession started amid the ringing of bells\r\nand the usual explosions of bombs. The Captain-General, who had gone\r\nout on foot in company with his two aides, Capitan Tiago, the alcalde,\r\nthe alferez, and Ibarra, preceded by civil-guards and officials who\r\nopened the way and cleared the street, was invited to review the\r\nprocession from the house of the gobernadorcillo, in front of which\r\na platform had been erected where a _loa_ [104] would be recited in\r\nhonor of the Blessed Patron.\r\n\r\nIbarra would gladly have renounced the pleasure of hearing this\r\npoetical composition, preferring to watch the procession from Capitan\r\nTiago's house, where Maria Clara had remained with some of her friends,\r\nbut his Excellency wished to hear the _loa_, so he had no recourse\r\nbut to console himself with the prospect of seeing her at the theater.\r\n\r\nThe procession was headed by the silver candelabra borne by three\r\nbegloved sacristans, behind whom came the school children in charge\r\nof their teacher, then boys with paper lanterns of varied shapes\r\nand colors placed on the ends of bamboo poles of greater or less\r\nlength and decorated according to the caprice of each boy, since\r\nthis illumination was furnished by the children of the barrios, who\r\ngladly performed this service, imposed by the _matanda sa nayon_,\r\n[105] each one designing and fashioning his own lantern, adorning it\r\nas his fancy prompted and his finances permitted with a greater or\r\nless number of frills and little streamers, and lighting it with a\r\npiece of candle if he had a friend or relative who was a sacristan,\r\nor if he could buy one of the small red tapers such as the Chinese\r\nburn before their altars.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the crowd came and went alguazils, guardians of\r\njustice to take care that the lines were not broken and the people\r\ndid not crowd together. For this purpose they availed themselves of\r\ntheir rods, with blows from which, administered opportunely and with\r\nsufficient force, they endeavored to add to the glory and brilliance\r\nof the procession--all for the edification of souls and the splendor\r\nof religious show. At the same time that the alguazils were thus\r\ndistributing free their sanctifying blows, other persons, to console\r\nthe recipients, distributed candles and tapers of different sizes,\r\nalso free.\r\n\r\n\"Señor Alcalde,\" said Ibarra in a low voice, \"do they administer those\r\nblows as a punishment for sin or simply because they like to do so?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're right, Señor Ibarra,\" answered the Captain-General, overhearing\r\nthe question. \"This barbarous sight is a wonder to all who come here\r\nfrom other countries. It ought to be forbidden.\"\r\n\r\nWithout any apparent reason, the first saint that appeared was St. John\r\nthe Baptist. On looking at him it might have been said that the fame\r\nof Our Savior's cousin did not amount to much among the people, for\r\nwhile it is true that he had the feet and legs of a maiden and the\r\nface of an anchorite, yet he was placed on an old wooden _andas_,\r\nand was hidden by a crowd of children who, armed with candles and\r\nunlighted lanterns, were engaging in mock fights.\r\n\r\n\"Unfortunate saint!\" muttered the Sage Tasio, who was watching the\r\nprocession from the street, \"it avails you nothing to have been the\r\nforerunner of the Good Tidings or that Jesus bowed before you! Your\r\ngreat faith and your austerity avail you nothing, nor the fact that\r\nyou died for the truth and your convictions, all of which men forget\r\nwhen they consider nothing more than their own merits. It avails more\r\nto preach badly in the churches than to be the eloquent voice crying\r\nin the desert, this is what the Philippines teaches you! If you had\r\neaten turkey instead of locusts and had worn garments of silk rather\r\nthan hides, if you had joined a Corporation--\"\r\n\r\nBut the old man suspended his apostrophe at the approach\r\nof St. Francis. \"Didn't I say so?\" he then went on, smiling\r\nsarcastically. \"This one rides on a ear, and, good Heavens, what a\r\ncar! How many lights and how many glass lanterns! Never did I see\r\nyou surrounded by so many luminaries, Giovanni Bernardone! [106]\r\nAnd what music! Other tunes were heard by your followers after your\r\ndeath! But, venerable and humble founder, if you were to come back\r\nto life now you would see only degenerate Eliases of Cortona, and\r\nif your followers should recognize you, they would put you in jail,\r\nand perhaps you would share the fate of Cesareus of Spyre.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the music came a banner on which was pictured the same saint, but\r\nwith seven wings, carried by the Tertiary Brethren dressed in _guingón_\r\nhabits and praying in high, plaintive voices. Rather inexplicably,\r\nnext came St. Mary Magdalene, a beautiful image with abundant hair,\r\nwearing a pañuelo of embroidered piña held by fingers covered with\r\nrings, and a silk gown decorated with gilt spangles. Lights and\r\nincense surrounded her while her glass tears reflected the colors\r\nof the Bengal lights, which, while giving a fantastic appearance to\r\nthe procession, also made the saintly sinner weep now green, now red,\r\nnow blue tears. The houses did not begin to light up until St. Francis\r\nwas passing; St. John the Baptist did not enjoy this honor and passed\r\nhastily by as if ashamed to be the only one dressed in hides in such\r\na crowd of folk covered with gold and jewels.\r\n\r\n\"There goes our saint!\" exclaimed the daughter of the gobernadorcillo\r\nto her visitors. \"I've lent him all my rings, but that's in order to\r\nget to heaven.\"\r\n\r\nThe candle-bearers stopped around the platform to listen to the _loa_\r\nand the blessed saints did the same; either they or their bearers\r\nwished to hear the verses. Those who were carrying St. John, tired\r\nof waiting, squatted down on their heels and agreed to set him on\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n\"The alguazil may scold!\" objected one of them.\r\n\r\n\"Huh, in the sacristy they leave him in a corner among the cobwebs!\"\r\n\r\nSo St. John, once on the ground, became one of the townsfolk.\r\n\r\nAs the Magdalene set out the women joined the procession, only that\r\ninstead of beginning with the children, as among the men, the old women\r\ncame first and the girls filled up the lines to the car of the Virgin,\r\nbehind which came the curate under his canopy. This practise they had\r\nfrom Padre Damaso, who said: \"To the Virgin the maidens and not the old\r\nwomen are pleasing!\" This statement had caused wry faces on the part\r\nof many saintly old ladies, but the Virgin did not change her tastes.\r\n\r\nSan Diego followed the Magdalene but did not seem to be rejoicing\r\nover this fact, since he moved along as repentantly as he had in\r\nthe morning when he followed St. Francis. His float was drawn by six\r\nTertiary Sisters--whether because of some vow or on account of some\r\nsickness, the fact is that they dragged him along, and with zeal. San\r\nDiego stopped in front of the platform and waited to be saluted.\r\n\r\nBut it was necessary to wait for the float of the Virgin, which was\r\npreceded by persons dressed like phantoms, who frightened the little\r\nchildren so that there were heard the cries and screams of terrified\r\nbabies. Yet in the midst of that dark mass of gowns, hoods, girdles,\r\nand nuns' veils, from which arose a monotonous and snuffling prayer,\r\nthere were to be seen, like white jasmines or fresh sampaguitas among\r\nold rags, twelve girls dressed in white, crowned with flowers, their\r\nhair curled, and flashing from their eyes glances as bright as their\r\nnecklaces. Like little genii of light who were prisoners of specters\r\nthey moved along holding to the wide blue ribbons tied to the Virgin's\r\ncar and suggesting the doves that draw the car of Spring.\r\n\r\nNow all the images were in attitudes of attention, crowded one against\r\nthe other to listen to the verses. Everybody kept his eyes fixed on\r\nthe half-drawn curtain until at length a sigh of admiration escaped\r\nfrom the lips of all. Deservedly so, too, for it was a boy with wings,\r\nriding-boots, sash, belt, and plumed hat.\r\n\r\n\"It's the alcalde!\" cried some one, but this prodigy of creation began\r\nto recite a poem like himself and took no offense at the comparison.\r\n\r\nBut why record here what he said in Latin, Tagalog, and Spanish, all\r\nin verse--this poor victim of the gobernadorcillo? Our readers have\r\nenjoyed Padre Damaso's sermon of the morning and we do not wish to\r\nspoil them by too many wonders. Besides, the Franciscan might feel\r\nhard toward us if we were to put forward a competitor, and this is\r\nfar from being the desire of such peaceful folk as we have the good\r\nfortune to be.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, the procession moved on, St. John proceeding along his\r\nvale of tears. When the Virgin passed the house of Capitan Tiago a\r\nheavenly song greeted her with the words of the archangel. It was\r\na voice tender, melodious, pleading, sighing out the _Ave Maria_\r\nof Gounod to the accompaniment of a piano that prayed with it. The\r\nmusic of the procession became hushed, the praying ceased, and even\r\nPadre Salvi himself paused. The voice trembled and became plaintive,\r\nexpressing more than a salutation--rather a prayer and a protest.\r\n\r\nTerror and melancholy settled down upon Ibarra's heart as he listened\r\nto the voice from the window where he stood. He comprehended what\r\nthat suffering soul was expressing in a song and yet feared to ask\r\nhimself the cause of such sorrow. Gloomy and thoughtful, he turned\r\nto the Captain-General.\r\n\r\n\"You will join me at the table,\" the latter said to him. \"There we'll\r\ntalk about those boys who disappeared.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could I be the cause?\" murmured the young man, staring without seeing\r\nthe Captain-General, whom he was following mechanically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\nDoña Consolacion\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy were the windows closed in the house of the alferez? Where\r\nwere the masculine features and the flannel camisa of the Medusa or\r\nMuse of the Civil Guard while the procession was passing? Had Doña\r\nConsolacion realized how disagreeable were her forehead seamed with\r\nthick veins that appeared to conduct not blood but vinegar and gall,\r\nand the thick cigar that made a fit ornament for her purple lips,\r\nand her envious leer, and yielding to a generous impulse had she\r\nwished not to disturb the pleasure of the populace by her sinister\r\nappearance? Ah, for her generous impulses existed in the Golden\r\nAge! The house, showed neither lanterns nor banners and was gloomy\r\nprecisely because the town was making merry, as Sinang said, and but\r\nfor the sentinel walking before the door appeared to be uninhabited.\r\n\r\nA dim light shone in the disordered sala, rendering transparent\r\nthe dirty concha-panes on which the cobwebs had fastened and the\r\ndust had become incrusted. The lady of the house, according to\r\nher indolent custom, was dozing on a wide sofa. She was dressed as\r\nusual, that is, badly and horribly: tied round her head a pañuelo,\r\nfrom beneath which escaped thin locks of tangled hair, a camisa\r\nof blue flannel over another which must once have been white, and\r\na faded skirt which showed the outlines of her thin, flat thighs,\r\nplaced one over the other and shaking feverishly. From her mouth\r\nissued little clouds of smoke which she puffed wearily in whatever\r\ndirection she happened to be looking when she opened her eyes. If at\r\nthat moment Don Francisco de Cañamaque [107] could have seen her, he\r\nwould have taken her for a cacique of the town or the _mankukúlam_,\r\nand then decorated his discovery with commentaries in the vernacular\r\nof the markets, invented by him for her particular use.\r\n\r\nThat morning she had not attended mass, not because she had not so\r\ndesired, for on the contrary she had wished to show herself to the\r\nmultitude and to hear the sermon, but her spouse had not permitted\r\nher to do so, his refusal being accompanied as usual by two or three\r\ninsults, oaths, and threats of kicking. The alferez knew that his\r\nmate dressed ridiculously and had the appearance of what is known as a\r\n\"_querida_ of the soldiers,\" so he did not care to expose her to the\r\ngaze of strangers and persons from the capital. But she did not so\r\nunderstand it. She knew that she was beautiful and attractive, that she\r\nhad the airs of a queen and dressed much better and with more splendor\r\nthan Maria Clara herself, who wore a tapis while she went in a flowing\r\nskirt. It was therefore necessary for the alferez to threaten her,\r\n\"Either shut up, or I'll kick you back to your damned town!\" Doña\r\nConsolacion did not care to return to her town at the toe of a boot,\r\nbut she meditated revenge.\r\n\r\nNever had the dark face of this lady been such as to inspire confidence\r\nin any one, not even when she painted, but that morning it greatly\r\nworried the servants, especially when they saw her move about the house\r\nfrom one part to another, silently, as if meditating something terrible\r\nor malign. Her glance reflected the look that springs from the eyes of\r\na serpent when caught and about to be crushed; it was cold, luminous,\r\nand penetrating, with something fascinating, loathsome, and cruel in\r\nit. The most insignificant error, the least unusual noise, drew from\r\nher a vile insult that struck into the soul, but no one answered her,\r\nfor to excuse oneself would have been an additional fault.\r\n\r\nSo the day passed. Not encountering any obstacle that would block her\r\nway,--her husband had been invited out,--she became saturated with\r\nbile, the cells of her whole organism seemed to become charged with\r\nelectricity which threatened to burst in a storm of hate. Everything\r\nabout her folded up as do the flowers at the first breath of the\r\nhurricane, so she met with no resistance nor found any point or high\r\nplace to discharge her evil humor. The soldiers and servants kept away\r\nfrom her. That she might not hear the sounds of rejoicing outside she\r\nhad ordered the windows closed and charged the sentinel to let no one\r\nenter. She tied a handkerchief around her head as if to keep it from\r\nbursting and, in spite of the fact that the sun was still shining,\r\nordered the lamps to be lighted.\r\n\r\nSisa, as we saw, had been arrested as a disturber of the peace\r\nand taken to the barracks. The alferez was not then present, so\r\nthe unfortunate woman had had to spend the night there seated on a\r\nbench in an abandoned attitude. The next day the alferez saw her,\r\nand fearing for her in those days of confusion nor caring to risk a\r\ndisagreeable scene, he had charged the soldiers to look after her,\r\nto treat her kindly, and to give her something to eat. Thus the\r\nmadwoman spent two days.\r\n\r\nTonight, whether the nearness to the house of Capitan Tiago had brought\r\nto her Maria Clara's sad song or whether other recollections awoke\r\nin her old melodies, whatever the cause, Sisa also began to sing in a\r\nsweet and melancholy voice the _kundíman_ of her youth. The soldiers\r\nheard her and fell silent; those airs awoke old memories of the days\r\nbefore they had been corrupted. Doña Consolacion also heard them in her\r\ntedium, and on learning who it was that sang, after a few moments of\r\nmeditation, ordered that Sisa be brought to her instantly. Something\r\nlike a smile wandered over her dry lips.\r\n\r\nWhen Sisa was brought in she came calmly, showing neither wonder nor\r\nfear. She seemed to see no lady or mistress, and this wounded the\r\nvanity of the Muse, who endeavored to inspire respect and fear. She\r\ncoughed, made a sign to the soldiers to leave her, and taking down\r\nher husband's whip, said to the crazy woman in a sinister tone,\r\n\"Come on, _magcantar icau!_\" [108]\r\n\r\nNaturally, Sisa did not understand such Tagalog, and this ignorance\r\ncalmed the Medusa's wrath, for one of the beautiful qualities of this\r\nlady was to try not to know Tagalog, or at least to appear not to know\r\nit. Speaking it the worst possible, she would thus give herself the\r\nair of a genuine _orofea_, [109] as she was accustomed to say. But\r\nshe did well, for if she martyrized Tagalog, Spanish fared no better\r\nwith her, either in regard to grammar or pronunciation, in spite of\r\nher husband, the chairs and the shoes, all of which had done what\r\nthey could to teach her.\r\n\r\nOne of the words that had cost her more effort than the hieroglyphics\r\ncost Champollion was the name _Filipinas_. The story goes that on\r\nthe day after her wedding, when she was talking with her husband, who\r\nwas then a corporal, she had said _Pilipinas_. The corporal thought\r\nit his duty to correct her, so he said, slapping her on the head,\r\n\"Say _Felipinas_, woman! Don't be stupid! Don't you know that's what\r\nyour damned country is called, from _Felipe?_\"\r\n\r\nThe woman, dreaming through her honeymoon, wished to obey and said\r\n_Felepinas_. To the corporal it seemed that she was getting nearer to\r\nit, so he increased the slaps and reprimanded her thus: \"But, woman,\r\ncan't you pronounce _Felipe?_ Don't forget it; you know the king,\r\nDon Felipe--the fifth--. Say _Felipe_, and add to it _nas_, which\r\nin Latin means 'islands of Indians,' and you have the name of your\r\ndamned country!\"\r\n\r\nConsolacion, at that time a washerwoman, patted her bruises and\r\nrepeated with symptoms of losing her patience, \"Fe-li-pe, Felipe--nas,\r\nFe-li-pe-nas, Felipinas, so?\"\r\n\r\nThe corporal saw visions. How could it be _Felipenas_ instead of\r\n_Felipinas?_ One of two things: either it was _Felipenas_ or it was\r\nnecessary to say _Felipi!_ So that day he very prudently dropped the\r\nsubject. Leaving his wife, he went to consult the books. Here his\r\nastonishment reached a climax: he rubbed his eyes--let's see--slowly,\r\nnow! _F-i-l-i-p-i-n-a-s_, Filipinas! So all the well-printed books\r\ngave it--neither he nor his wife was right!\r\n\r\n\"How's this?\" he murmured. \"Can history lie? Doesn't this book say that\r\nAlonso Saavedra gave the country that name in honor of the prince,\r\nDon Felipe? How was that name corrupted? Can it be that this Alonso\r\nSaavedra was an Indian?\" [110]\r\n\r\nWith these doubts he went to consult the sergeant Gomez, who, as\r\na youth, had wanted to be a curate. Without deigning to look at\r\nthe corporal the sergeant blew out a mouthful of smoke and answered\r\nwith great pompousness, \"In ancient times it was pronounced _Filipi_\r\ninstead of _Felipe_. But since we moderns have become Frenchified we\r\ncan't endure two _i's_ in succession, so cultured people, especially\r\nin Madrid--you've never been in Madrid?--cultured people, as I say,\r\nhave begun to change the first _i_ to _e_ in many words. This is\r\ncalled modernizing yourself.\"\r\n\r\nThe poor corporal had never been in Madrid--here was the cause of\r\nhis failure to understand the riddle: what things are learned in\r\nMadrid! \"So now it's proper to say--\"\r\n\r\n\"In the ancient style, man! This country's not yet cultured! In the\r\nancient style, _Filipinas!_\" exclaimed Gomez disdainfully.\r\n\r\nThe corporal, even if he was a bad philologist, was yet a good\r\nhusband. What he had just learned his spouse must also know, so he\r\nproceeded with her education: \"Consola, what do you call your damned\r\ncountry?\"\r\n\r\n\"What should I call it? Just what you taught me: _Felifinas!_\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll throw a chair at you, you ----! Yesterday you pronounced it\r\neven better in the modern style, but now it's proper to pronounce it\r\nlike an ancient: _Feli_, I mean, _Filipinas!_\"\r\n\r\n\"Remember that I'm no ancient! What are you thinking about?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind! Say _Filipinas!_\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to. I'm no ancient baggage, scarcely thirty years\r\nold!\" she replied, rolling up her sleeves and preparing herself for\r\nthe fray.\r\n\r\n\"Say it, you ----, or I'll throw this chair at you!\"\r\n\r\nConsolacion saw the movement, reflected, then began to stammer with\r\nheavy breaths, \"_Feli-, Fele-, File--_\"\r\n\r\nPum! Crack! The chair finished the word. So the lesson ended in\r\nfisticuffs, scratchings, slaps. The corporal caught her by the hair;\r\nshe grabbed his goatee, but was unable to bite because of her loose\r\nteeth. He let out a yell, released her and begged her pardon. Blood\r\nbegan to flow, one eye got redder than the other, a camisa was torn\r\ninto shreds, many things came to light, but not _Filipinas_.\r\n\r\nSimilar incidents occurred every time the question of language came\r\nup. The corporal, watching her linguistic progress, sorrowfully\r\ncalculated that in ten years his mate would have completely forgotten\r\nhow to talk, and this was about what really came to pass. When they\r\nwere married she still knew Tagalog and could make herself understood\r\nin Spanish, but now, at the time of our story, she no longer spoke any\r\nlanguage. She had become so addicted to expressing herself by means\r\nof signs--and of these she chose the loudest and most impressive--that\r\nshe could have given odds to the inventor of Volapuk.\r\n\r\nSisa, therefore, had the good fortune not to understand her, so\r\nthe Medusa smoothed out her eyebrows a little, while a smile of\r\nsatisfaction lighted up her face; undoubtedly she did not know Tagalog,\r\nshe was an _orofea!_\r\n\r\n\"Boy, tell her in Tagalog to sing! She doesn't understand me, she\r\ndoesn't understand Spanish!\"\r\n\r\nThe madwoman understood the boy and began to sing the _Song of\r\nthe Night_. Doña Consolacion listened at first with a sneer, which\r\ndisappeared little by little from her lips. She became attentive, then\r\nserious, and even somewhat thoughtful. The voice, the sentiment in the\r\nlines, and the song itself affected her--that dry and withered heart\r\nwas perhaps thirsting for rain. She understood it well: \"The sadness,\r\nthe cold, and the moisture that descend from the sky when wrapped in\r\nthe mantle of night,\" so ran the _kundíman_, seemed to be descending\r\nalso on her heart. \"The withered and faded flower which during the\r\nday flaunted her finery, seeking applause and full of vanity, at\r\neventide, repentant and disenchanted, makes an effort to raise her\r\ndrooping petals to the sky, seeking a little shade to hide herself and\r\ndie without the mocking of the light that saw her in her splendor,\r\nwithout seeing the vanity of her pride, begging also that a little\r\ndew should weep upon her. The nightbird leaves his solitary retreat,\r\nthe hollow of an ancient trunk, and disturbs the sad loneliness of\r\nthe open places--\"\r\n\r\n\"No, don't sing!\" she exclaimed in perfect Tagalog, as she rose with\r\nagitation. \"Don't sing! Those verses hurt me.\"\r\n\r\nThe crazy woman became silent. The boy ejaculated, \"_Abá!_ She talks\r\nTagalog!\" and stood staring with admiration at his mistress, who,\r\nrealizing that she had given herself away, was ashamed of it, and as\r\nher nature was not that of a woman, the shame took the aspect of rage\r\nand hate; so she showed the door to the imprudent boy and closed it\r\nbehind him with a kick.\r\n\r\nTwisting the whip in her nervous hands, she took a few turns around\r\nthe room, then stopping suddenly in front of the crazy woman, said\r\nto her in Spanish, \"Dance!\" But Sisa did not move.\r\n\r\n\"Dance, dance!\" she repeated in a sinister tone.\r\n\r\nThe madwoman looked at her with wandering, expressionless eyes, while\r\nthe alfereza lifted one of her arms, then the other, and shook them,\r\nbut to no purpose, for Sisa did not understand. Then she began to\r\njump about and shake herself, encouraging Sisa to imitate her. In\r\nthe distance was to be heard the music of the procession playing\r\na grave and majestic march, but Doña Consolacion danced furiously,\r\nkeeping other time to other music resounding within her. Sisa gazed at\r\nher without moving, while her eyes expressed curiosity and something\r\nlike a weak smile hovered around her pallid lips: the lady's dancing\r\namused her. The latter stopped as if ashamed, raised the whip,--that\r\nterrible whip known to thieves and soldiers, made in Ulango [111]\r\nand perfected by the alferez with twisted wires,--and said, \"Now it's\r\nyour turn to dance--dance!\"\r\n\r\nShe began to strike the madwoman's bare feet gently with the\r\nwhip. Sisa's face drew up with pain and she was forced to protect\r\nherself with her hands.\r\n\r\n\"Aha, now you're starting!\" she exclaimed with savage joy, passing\r\nfrom _lento_ to _allegro vivace_.\r\n\r\nThe afflicted Sisa gave a cry of pain and quickly raised her foot.\r\n\r\n\"You've got to dance, you Indian--!\" The whip swung and whistled.\r\n\r\nSisa let herself fall to the floor and placed both hands on her knees\r\nwhile she gazed at her tormentor with wildly-staring eyes. Two sharp\r\ncuts of the whip on her shoulder made her stand up, and it was not\r\nmerely a cry but a howl that the unfortunate woman uttered. Her thin\r\ncamisa was torn, her skin broken, and the blood was flowing.\r\n\r\nThe sight of blood arouses the tiger; the blood of her victim aroused\r\nDoña Consolacion. \"Dance, damn you, dance! Evil to the mother who\r\nbore you!\" she cried. \"Dance, or I'll flog you to death!\" She then\r\ncaught Sisa with one hand and, whipping her with the other, began to\r\ndance about.\r\n\r\nThe crazy woman at last understood and followed the example by\r\nswinging her arms about awkwardly. A smile of satisfaction curled\r\nthe lips of her teacher, the smile of a female Mephistopheles who\r\nsucceeds in getting a great pupil. There were in it hate, disdain,\r\njest, and cruelty; with a burst of demoniacal laughter she could not\r\nhave expressed more.\r\n\r\nThus, absorbed in the joy of the sight, she was not aware of the\r\narrival of her husband until he opened the door with a loud kick. The\r\nalferez appeared pale and gloomy, and when he saw what was going on\r\nhe threw a terrible glance at his wife, who did not move from her\r\nplace but stood smiling at him cynically.\r\n\r\nThe alferez put his hand as gently as he could on the shoulder of\r\nthe strange dancer and made her stop. The crazy woman sighed and sank\r\nslowly to the floor covered with her own blood.\r\n\r\nThe silence continued. The alferez breathed heavily, while his wife\r\nwatched him with questioning eyes. She picked up the whip and asked\r\nin a smooth, soft voice, \"What's the matter with you? You haven't\r\neven wished me good evening.\"\r\n\r\nThe alferez did not answer, but instead called the boy and said to him,\r\n\"Take this woman away and tell Marta to get her some other clothes\r\nand attend to her. You give her something to eat and a good bed. Take\r\ncare that she isn't ill-treated! Tomorrow she'll be taken to Señor\r\nIbarra's house.\"\r\n\r\nThen he closed the door carefully, bolted it, and approached his\r\nwife. \"You're tempting me to kill you!\" he exclaimed, doubling up\r\nhis fists.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter with you?\" she asked, rising and drawing away\r\nfrom him.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter with me!\" he yelled in a voice of thunder, letting\r\nout an oath and holding up before her a sheet of paper covered with\r\nscrawls. \"Didn't you write this letter to the alcalde saying that\r\nI'm bribed to permit gambling, huh? I don't know why I don't beat\r\nyou to death.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's see you! Let's see you try it if you dare!\" she replied with\r\na jeering laugh. \"The one who beats me to death has got to be more\r\nof a man than you are!\"\r\n\r\nHe heard the insult, but saw the whip. Catching up a plate from the\r\ntable, he threw it at her head, but she, accustomed to such fights,\r\ndodged quickly and the plate was shattered against the wall. A cup\r\nand saucer met with a similar fate.\r\n\r\n\"Coward!\" she yelled; \"you're afraid to come near me!\" And to\r\nexasperate him the more, she spat upon him.\r\n\r\nThe alferez went blind from rage and with a roar attempted to throw\r\nhimself upon her, but she, with astonishing quickness, hit him across\r\nthe face with the whip and ran hurriedly into an inner room, shutting\r\nand bolting the door violently behind her. Bellowing with rage and\r\npain, he followed, but was only able to run against the door, which\r\nmade him vomit oaths.\r\n\r\n\"Accursed be your offspring, you sow! Open, open, or I'll break your\r\nhead!\" he howled, beating the door with his hands and feet.\r\n\r\nNo answer was heard, but instead the scraping of chairs and trunks as\r\nif she was building a barricade with the furniture. The house shook\r\nunder the kicks and curses of the alferez.\r\n\r\n\"Don't come in, don't come in!\" called the sour voice inside. \"If\r\nyou show yourself, I'll shoot you.\"\r\n\r\nBy degrees he appeared to become calm and contented himself with\r\nwalking up and down the room like a wild beast in its cage.\r\n\r\n\"Go out into the street and cool off your head!\" the woman continued\r\nto jeer at him, as she now seemed to have completed her preparations\r\nfor defense.\r\n\r\n\"I swear that if I catch you, even God won't save you, you old sow!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, now you can say what you like. You didn't want me to go to\r\nmass! You didn't let me attend to my religious duties!\" she answered\r\nwith such sarcasm as only she knew how to use.\r\n\r\nThe alferez put on his helmet, arranged his clothing a little, and\r\nwent out with heavy steps, but returned after a few minutes without\r\nmaking the least noise, having taken off his shoes. The servants,\r\naccustomed to these brawls, were usually bored, but this novelty of the\r\nshoes attracted their attention, so they winked to one another. The\r\nalferez sat down quietly in a chair at the side of the Sublime Port\r\nand had the patience to wait for more than half an hour.\r\n\r\n\"Have you really gone out or are you still there, old goat?\" asked\r\nthe voice from time to time, changing the epithets and raising the\r\ntone. At last she began to take away the furniture piece by piece. He\r\nheard the noise and smiled.\r\n\r\n\"Boy, has your master gone out?\" cried Doña Consolacion.\r\n\r\nAt a sign from the alferez the boy answered, \"Yes, señora, he's\r\ngone out.\"\r\n\r\nA gleeful laugh was heard from her as she pulled back the bolt. Slowly\r\nher husband arose, the door opened a little way--\r\n\r\nA yell, the sound of a falling body, oaths, howls, curses, blows,\r\nhoarse voices--who can tell what took place in the darkness of\r\nthat room?\r\n\r\nAs the boy went out into the kitchen he made a significant sign to\r\nthe cook, who said to him, \"You'll pay for that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I? In any case the whole town will! She asked me if he had gone out,\r\nnot if he had come back!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\n\r\nRight and Might\r\n\r\n\r\nTen o'clock at night: the last rockets rose lazily in the dark sky\r\nwhere a few paper balloons recently inflated with smoke and hot air\r\nstill glimmered like new stars. Some of those adorned with fireworks\r\ntook fire, threatening all the houses, so there might be seen on the\r\nridges of the roofs men armed with pails of water and long poles with\r\npieces of cloth on the ends. Their black silhouettes stood out in\r\nthe vague clearness of the air like phantoms that had descended from\r\nspace to witness the rejoicings of men. Many pieces of fireworks of\r\nfantastic shapes--wheels, castles, bulls, carabaos--had been set off,\r\nsurpassing in beauty and grandeur anything ever before seen by the\r\ninhabitants of San Diego.\r\n\r\nNow the people were moving in crowds toward the plaza to attend the\r\ntheater for the last time, Here and there might be seen Bengal lights\r\nfantastically illuminating the merry groups while the boys were\r\navailing themselves of torches to hunt in the grass for unexploded\r\nbombs and other remnants that could still be used. But soon the music\r\ngave the signal and all abandoned the open places.\r\n\r\nThe great stage was brilliantly illuminated. Thousands of lights\r\nsurrounded the posts, hung from the roof, or sowed the floor with\r\npyramidal clusters. An alguazil was looking after these, and when he\r\ncame forward to attend to them the crowd shouted at him and whistled,\r\n\"There he is! there he is!\"\r\n\r\nIn front of the curtain the orchestra players were tuning their\r\ninstruments and playing preludes of airs. Behind them was the space\r\nspoken of by the correspondent in his letter, where the leading\r\ncitizens of the town, the Spaniards, and the rich visitors occupied\r\nrows of chairs. The general public, the nameless rabble, filled\r\nup the rest of the place, some of them bringing benches on their\r\nshoulders not so much for seats as to make, up for their lack of\r\nstature. This provoked noisy protests on the part of the benchless,\r\nso the offenders got down at once; but before long they were up again\r\nas if nothing had happened.\r\n\r\nGoings and comings, cries, exclamations, bursts of laughter, a\r\nserpent-cracker turned loose, a firecracker set off--all contributed\r\nto swell the uproar. Here a bench had a leg broken off and the\r\npeople fell to the ground amid the laughter of the crowd. They were\r\nvisitors who had come from afar to observe and now found themselves\r\nthe observed. Over there they quarreled and disputed over a seat,\r\na little farther on was heard the noise of breaking glass; it\r\nwas Andeng carrying refreshments and drinks, holding the wide tray\r\ncarefully with both hands, but by chance she had met her sweetheart,\r\nwho tried to take advantage of the situation.\r\n\r\nThe teniente-mayor, Don Filipo, presided over the show, as the\r\ngobernadorcillo was fond of monte. He was talking with old Tasio. \"What\r\ncan I do? The alcalde was unwilling to accept my resignation. 'Don't\r\nyou feel strong enough to attend to your duties?' he asked me.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did you answer him?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Señor Alcalde,' I answered, 'the strength of a teniente-mayor,\r\nhowever insignificant it may be, is like all other authority it\r\nemanates from higher spheres. The King himself receives his strength\r\nfrom the people and the people theirs from God. That is exactly what\r\nI lack, Señor Alcalde.' But he did not care to listen to me, telling\r\nme that we would talk about it after the fiesta.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then may God help you!\" said the old man, starting away.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you want to see the show?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, no! For dreams and nonsense I am sufficient unto myself,\" the\r\nSage answered with a sarcastic smile. \"But now I think of it, has your\r\nattention never been drawn to the character of our people? Peaceful,\r\nyet fond of warlike shows and bloody fights; democratic, yet adoring\r\nemperors, kings, and princes; irreligious, yet impoverishing itself\r\nby costly religious pageants. Our women have gentle natures yet go\r\nwild with joy when a princess flourishes a lance. Do you know to what\r\nit is due? Well--\"\r\n\r\nThe arrival of Maria Clara and her friends put an end to this\r\nconversation. Don Filipo met them and ushered them to their\r\nseats. Behind them came the curate with another Franciscan and some\r\nSpaniards. Following the priests were a number of the townsmen who\r\nmake it their business to escort the friars. \"May God reward them\r\nalso in the next life,\" muttered old Tasio as he went away.\r\n\r\nThe play began with Chananay and Marianito in _Crispino é la\r\ncomare_. All now had their eyes and ears turned to the stage, all but\r\none: Padre Salvi, who seemed to have gone there for no other purpose\r\nthan that of watching Maria Clara, whose sadness gave to her beauty an\r\nair so ideal and interesting that it was easy to understand how she\r\nmight be looked upon with rapture. But the eyes of the Franciscan,\r\ndeeply hidden in their sunken sockets, spoke nothing of rapture. In\r\nthat gloomy gaze was to be read something desperately sad--with such\r\neyes Cain might have gazed from afar on the Paradise whose delights\r\nhis mother pictured to him!\r\n\r\nThe first scene was over when Ibarra entered. His appearance caused a\r\nmurmur, and attention was fixed on him and the curate. But the young\r\nman seemed not to notice anything as he greeted Maria Clara and her\r\nfriends in a natural way and took a seat beside them.\r\n\r\nThe only one who spoke to him was Sinang. \"Did you see the\r\nfireworks?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"No, little friend, I had to go with the Captain-General.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's a shame! The curate was with us and told us stories\r\nof the damned--can you imagine it!--to fill us with fear so that we\r\nmight not enjoy ourselves--can you imagine it!\"\r\n\r\nThe curate arose and approached Don Filipo, with whom he began an\r\nanimated conversation. The former spoke in a nervous manner, the\r\nlatter in a low, measured voice.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry that I can't please your Reverence,\" said Don Filipo,\r\n\"but Señor Ibarra is one of the heaviest contributors and has a right\r\nto be here as long as he doesn't disturb the peace.\"\r\n\r\n\"But isn't it disturbing the peace to scandalize good Christians? It's\r\nletting a wolf enter the fold. You will answer for this to God and\r\nthe authorities!\"\r\n\r\n\"I always answer for the actions that spring from my own will, Padre,\"\r\nreplied Don Filipo with a slight bow. \"But my little authority does not\r\nempower me to mix in religious affairs. Those who wish to avoid contact\r\nwith him need not talk to him. Señor Ibarra forces himself on no one.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it's giving opportunity for danger, and he who loves danger\r\nperishes in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see any danger, Padre. The alcalde and the Captain-General,\r\nmy superior officers, have been talking with him all the afternoon\r\nand it's not for me to teach them a lesson.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you don't put him out of here, we'll leave.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm very sorry, but I can't put any one out of here.\" The curate\r\nrepented of his threat, but it was too late to retract, so he made\r\na sign to his companion, who arose with regret, and the two went\r\nout together. The persons attached to them followed their example,\r\ncasting looks of hatred at Ibarra.\r\n\r\nThe murmurs and whispers increased. A number of people approached\r\nthe young man and said to him, \"We're with you, don't take any notice\r\nof them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whom do you mean by _them?_\" Ibarra asked in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Those who've just left to avoid contact with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Left to avoid contact with me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they say that you're excommunicated.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excommunicated?\" The astonished youth did not know what to say. He\r\nlooked about him and saw that Maria Clara was hiding her face behind\r\nher fan. \"But is it possible?\" he exclaimed finally. \"Are we still\r\nin the Dark Ages? So--\"\r\n\r\nHe approached the young women and said with a change of tone, \"Excuse\r\nme, I've forgotten an engagement. I'll be back to see you home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stay!\" Sinang said to him. \"Yeyeng is going to dance _La\r\nCalandria_. She dances divinely.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't, little friend, but I'll be back.\" The uproar increased.\r\n\r\nYeyeng appeared fancifully dressed, with the \"_Da usté su\r\npermiso_?\" and Carvajal was answering her, \"_Pase usté adelante_,\"\r\nwhen two soldiers of the Civil Guard went up to Don Filipo and ordered\r\nhim to stop the performance.\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" asked the teniente-mayor in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Because the alferez and his wife have been fighting and can't sleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell the alferez that we have permission from the alcalde and that\r\nagainst such permission _no one_ in the town has any authority,\r\nnot even the gobernadorcillo himself, and _he_ is my _only superior_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the show must stop!\" repeated the soldiers. Don Filipo turned\r\nhis back and they went away. In order not to disturb the merriment\r\nhe told no one about the incident.\r\n\r\nAfter the selection of vaudeville, which was loudly applauded,\r\nthe Prince Villardo presented himself, challenging to mortal combat\r\nthe Moros who held his father prisoner. The hero threatened to cut\r\noff all their heads at a single stroke and send them to the moon,\r\nbut fortunately for the Moros, who were disposing themselves for\r\nthe combat, a tumult arose. The orchestra suddenly ceased playing,\r\nthrew their instruments away, and jumped up on the stage. The valiant\r\nVillardo, not expecting them and taking them for allies of the Moros,\r\ndropped his sword and shield, and started to run. The Moros, seeing\r\nthat such a doughty Christian was fleeing, did not consider it improper\r\nto imitate him. Cries, groans, prayers, oaths were heard, while the\r\npeople ran and pushed one another about. The lights were extinguished,\r\nblazing lamps were thrown into the air. \"Tulisanes! Tulisanes!\" cried\r\nsome. \"Fire, fire! Robbers!\" shouted others. Women and children wept,\r\nbenches and spectators were rolled together on the ground amid the\r\ngeneral pandemonium.\r\n\r\nThe cause of all this uproar was two civil-guards, clubs in hand,\r\nchasing the musicians in order to break up the performance. The\r\nteniente-mayor, with the aid of the cuadrilleros, who were armed\r\nwith old sabers, managed at length to arrest them, in spite of their\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\n\"Take them to the town hall!\" cried Don Filipo. \"Take care that they\r\ndon't get away!\"\r\n\r\nIbarra had returned to look for Maria Clara. The frightened girls clung\r\nto him pale and trembling while Aunt Isabel recited the Latin litany.\r\n\r\nWhen the people were somewhat calmed down from their fright and had\r\nlearned the cause of the disturbance, they were beside themselves\r\nwith indignation. Stones rained on the squad of cuadrilleros who were\r\nconducting the two offenders from the scene, and there were even those\r\nwho proposed to set fire to the barracks of the Civil Guard so as to\r\nroast Doña Consolacion along with the alferez.\r\n\r\n\"That's what they're good for!\" cried a woman, doubling up her fists\r\nand stretching out her arms. \"To disturb the town! They don't chase any\r\nbut honest folks! Out yonder are the tulisanes and the gamblers. Let's\r\nset fire to the barracks!\"\r\n\r\nOne man was beating himself on the arm and begging for\r\nconfession. Plaintive sounds issued from under the overturned\r\nbenches--it was a poor musician. The stage was crowded with actors\r\nand spectators, all talking at the same time. There was Chananay\r\ndressed as Leonor in _Il Trovatore_, talking in the language of the\r\nmarkets to Ratia in the costume of a schoolmaster; Yeyeng, wrapped\r\nin a silk shawl, was clinging to the Prince Villardo; while Balbino\r\nand the Moros were exerting themselves to console the more or less\r\ninjured musicians. [112] Several Spaniards went from group to group\r\nharanguing every one they met.\r\n\r\nA large crowd was forming, whose intention Don Filipo seemed to be\r\naware of, for he ran to stop them. \"Don't disturb the peace!\" he\r\ncried. \"Tomorrow we'll ask for an accounting and we'll get\r\njustice. I'll answer for it that we get justice!\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" was the reply of several. \"They did the same thing in Kalamba,\r\n[113] the same promise was made, but the alcalde did nothing. We'll\r\ntake the law into our own hands! To the barracks!\"\r\n\r\nIn vain the teniente-mayor pleaded with them. The crowd maintained its\r\nhostile attitude, so he looked about him for help and noticed Ibarra.\r\n\r\n\"Señor Ibarra, as a favor! Restrain them while I get some\r\ncuadrilleros.\"\r\n\r\n\"What can I do?\" asked the perplexed youth, but the teniente-mayor was\r\nalready at a distance. He gazed about him seeking he knew not whom,\r\nwhen accidentally he discerned Elias, who stood impassively watching\r\nthe disturbance.\r\n\r\nIbarra ran to him, caught him by the arm, and said to him in Spanish:\r\n\"For God's sake, do something, if you can! I can't do anything.\" The\r\npilot must have understood him, for he disappeared in the crowd. Lively\r\ndisputes and sharp exclamations were heard. Gradually the crowd began\r\nto break up, its members each taking a less hostile attitude. It was\r\nhigh time, indeed, for the soldiers were already rushing out armed\r\nand with fixed bayonets.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, what had the curate been doing? Padre Salvi had not gone\r\nto bed but had stood motionless, resting his forehead against the\r\ncurtains and gazing toward the plaza. From time to time a suppressed\r\nsigh escaped him, and if the light of the lamp had not been so\r\ndim, perhaps it would have been possible to see his eyes fill with\r\ntears. Thus nearly an hour passed.\r\n\r\nThe tumult in the plaza awoke him from his reverie. With startled\r\neyes he saw the confused movements of the people, while their\r\nvoices came up to him faintly. A breathless servant informed him\r\nof what was happening. A thought shot across his mind: in the midst\r\nof confusion and tumult is the time when libertines take advantage\r\nof the consternation and weakness of woman. Every one seeks to save\r\nhimself, no one thinks of any one else; a cry is not heard or heeded,\r\nwomen faint, are struck and fall, terror and fright heed not shame,\r\nunder the cover of night--and when they are in love! He imagined\r\nthat he saw Crisostomo snatch the fainting Maria Clara up in his\r\narms and disappear into the darkness. So he went down the stairway by\r\nleaps and bounds, and without hat or cane made for the plaza like a\r\nmadman. There he met some Spaniards who were reprimanding the soldiers,\r\nbut on looking toward the seats that the girls had occupied he saw\r\nthat they were vacant.\r\n\r\n\"Padre! Padre!\" cried the Spaniards, but he paid no attention to\r\nthem as he ran in the direction of Capitan Tiago's. There he breathed\r\nmore freely, for he saw in the open hallway the adorable silhouette,\r\nfull of grace and soft in outline, of Maria Clara, and that of the\r\naunt carrying cups and glasses.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" he murmured, \"it seems that she has been taken sick only.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAunt Isabel at that moment closed the windows and the graceful shadow\r\nwas no longer to be seen. The curate moved away without heeding the\r\ncrowd. He had before his eyes the beautiful form of a maiden sleeping\r\nand breathing sweetly. Her eyelids were shaded by long lashes which\r\nformed graceful curves like those of the Virgins of Raphael, the\r\nlittle mouth was smiling, all the features breathed forth virginity,\r\npurity, and innocence. That countenance formed a sweet vision in the\r\nmidst of the white coverings of her bed like the head of a cherub\r\namong the clouds. His imagination went still further--but who can\r\nwrite what a burning brain can imagine?\r\n\r\nPerhaps only the newspaper correspondent, who concluded his account\r\nof the fiesta and its accompanying incidents in the following manner:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A thousand thanks, infinite thanks, to the opportune and active\r\nintervention of the Very Reverend Padre Fray Bernardo Salvi, who,\r\ndefying every danger in the midst of the unbridled mob, without hat\r\nor cane, calmed the wrath of the crowd, using only his persuasive\r\nword with the majesty and authority that are never lacking to a\r\nminister of a Religion of Peace. With unparalleled self-abnegation\r\nthis virtuous priest tore himself from sweet repose, such as every\r\ngood conscience like his enjoys, and rushed to protect his flock\r\nfrom the least harm. The people of San Diego will hardly forget this\r\nsublime deed of their heroic Pastor, remembering to hold themselves\r\ngrateful to him for all eternity!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI\r\n\r\nTwo Visits\r\n\r\n\r\nIbarra was in such a state of mind that he found it impossible to\r\nsleep, so to distract his attention from the sad thoughts which are\r\nso exaggerated during the night-hours he set to work in his lonely\r\ncabinet. Day found him still making mixtures and combinations, to the\r\naction of which he subjected pieces of bamboo and other substances,\r\nplacing them afterwards in numbered and sealed jars.\r\n\r\nA servant entered to announce the arrival of a man who had the\r\nappearance of being from the country. \"Show him in,\" said Ibarra\r\nwithout looking around.\r\n\r\nElias entered and remained standing in silence.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, it's you!\" exclaimed Ibarra in Tagalog when he recognized\r\nhim. \"Excuse me for making you wait, I didn't notice that it was\r\nyou. I'm making an important experiment.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to disturb you,\" answered the youthful pilot. \"I've\r\ncome first to ask you if there is anything I can do for you in the\r\nprovince, of Batangas, for which I am leaving immediately, and also\r\nto bring you some bad news.\"\r\n\r\nIbarra questioned him with a look.\r\n\r\n\"Capitan Tiago's daughter is ill,\" continued Elias quietly, \"but\r\nnot seriously.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what I feared,\" murmured Ibarra in a weak voice. \"Do you know\r\nwhat is the matter with her?\"\r\n\r\n\"A fever. Now, if you have nothing to command--\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, my friend, no. I wish you a pleasant journey. But first\r\nlet me ask you a question--if it is indiscreet, do not answer.\"\r\n\r\nElias bowed.\r\n\r\n\"How were you able to quiet the disturbance last night?\" asked Ibarra,\r\nlooking steadily at him.\r\n\r\n\"Very easily,\" answered Elias in the most natural manner. \"The leaders\r\nof the commotion were two brothers whose father died from a beating\r\ngiven him by the Civil Guard. One day I had the good fortune to\r\nsave them from the same hands into which their father had fallen,\r\nand both are accordingly grateful to me. I appealed to them last\r\nnight and they undertook to dissuade the rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"And those two brothers whose father died from the beating--\"\r\n\r\n\"Will end as their father did,\" replied Elias in a low voice. \"When\r\nmisfortune has once singled out a family all its members must\r\nperish,--when the lightning strikes a tree the whole is reduced\r\nto ashes.\"\r\n\r\nIbarra fell silent on hearing this, so Elias took his leave. When\r\nthe youth found himself alone he lost the serene self-possession he\r\nhad maintained in the pilot's presence. His sorrow pictured itself\r\non his countenance. \"I, I have made her suffer,\" he murmured.\r\n\r\nHe dressed himself quickly and descended the stairs. A small man,\r\ndressed in mourning, with a large scar on his left cheek, saluted\r\nhim humbly, and detained him on his way.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want?\" asked Ibarra.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, my name is Lucas, and I'm the brother of the man who was killed\r\nyesterday.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you have my sympathy. Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir, I want to know how much you're going to pay my brother's family.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pay?\" repeated the young man, unable to conceal his disgust. \"We'll\r\ntalk of that later. Come back this afternoon, I'm in a hurry now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only tell me how much you're willing to pay,\" insisted Lucas.\r\n\r\n\"I've told you that we'll talk about that some other time. I haven't\r\ntime now,\" repeated Ibarra impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"You haven't time now, sir?\" asked Lucas bitterly, placing himself\r\nin front of the young man. \"You haven't time to consider the dead?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come this afternoon, my good man,\" replied Ibarra, restraining\r\nhimself. \"I'm on my way now to visit a sick person.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, for the sick you forget the dead? Do you think that because we\r\nare poor--\"\r\n\r\nIbarra looked at him and interrupted, \"Don't try my patience!\" then\r\nwent on his way.\r\n\r\nLucas stood looking after him with a smile full of hate. \"It's easy to\r\nsee that you're the grandson of the man who tied my father out in the\r\nsun,\" he muttered between his teeth. \"You still have the same blood.\"\r\n\r\nThen with a change of tone he added, \"But, if you pay well--friends!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII\r\n\r\nThe Espadañas\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fiesta is over. The people of the town have again found, as in\r\nevery other year, that their treasury is poorer, that they have worked,\r\nsweated, and stayed awake much without really amusing themselves,\r\nwithout gaining any new friends, and, in a word, that they have dearly\r\nbought their dissipation and their headaches. But this matters nothing,\r\nfor the same will be done next year, the same the coming century,\r\nsince it has always been the custom.\r\n\r\nIn Capitan Tiago's house sadness reigns. All the windows are closed,\r\nthe inmates move about noiselessly, and only in the kitchen do they\r\ndare to speak in natural tones. Maria Clara, the soul of the house,\r\nlies sick in bed and her condition is reflected in all the faces,\r\nas the sorrows of the mind may be read in the countenance of an\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\n\"Which seems best to you, Isabel, shall I make a poor-offering to the\r\ncross of Tunasan or to the cross of Matahong?\" asks the afflicted\r\nfather in a low voice. \"The Tunasan cross grows while the Matahong\r\ncross sweats which do you think is more miraculous?\"\r\n\r\nAunt Isabel reflects, shakes her head, and murmurs, \"To grow, to grow\r\nis a greater miracle than to sweat. All of us sweat, but not all of\r\nus grow.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right, Isabel; but remember that to sweat for the wood of\r\nwhich bench-legs are made to sweat--is not a small miracle. Come,\r\nthe best thing will be to make poor-offerings to both crosses, so\r\nneither will resent it, and Maria will get better sooner. Are the\r\nrooms ready? You know that with the doctors is coming a new gentleman,\r\na distant relative of Padre Damaso's. Nothing should be lacking.\"\r\n\r\nAt the other end of the dining-room are the two cousins, Sinang and\r\nVictoria, who have come to keep the sick girl company. Andeng is\r\nhelping them clean a silver tea-set.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know Dr. Espadaña?\" the foster-sister of Maria Clara asks\r\nVictoria curiously.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replies the latter, \"the only thing that I know about him is\r\nthat he charges high, according to Capitan Tiago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then he must be good!\" exclaims Andeng. \"The one who performed an\r\noperation on Doña Maria charged high; so he was learned.\"\r\n\r\n\"Silly!\" retorts Sinang. \"Every one who charges high is not\r\nlearned. Look at Dr. Guevara; after performing a bungling operation\r\nthat cost the life of both mother and child, he charged the widower\r\nfifty pesos. The thing to know is how to charge!\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you know about it?\" asks her cousin, nudging her.\r\n\r\n\"Don't I know? The husband, who is a poor sawyer, after losing his\r\nwife had to lose his home also, for the alcalde, being a friend of\r\nthe doctor's, made him pay. Don't I know about it, when my father\r\nlent him the money to make the journey to Santa Cruz?\" [114]\r\n\r\nThe sound of a carriage stopping in front of the house put an end\r\nto these conversations. Capitan Tiago, followed by Aunt Isabel, ran\r\ndown the steps to welcome the new arrivals: the Doctor Don Tiburcio\r\nde Espadaña, his señora the _Doctora_ Doña Victorina de los Reyes\r\n_de_ De Espadaña, and a young Spaniard of pleasant countenance and\r\nagreeable aspect.\r\n\r\nDoña Victorina was attired in a loose silk gown embroidered with\r\nflowers and a hat with a huge parrot half-crushed between blue and\r\nred ribbons. The dust of the road mingled with the rice-powder on\r\nher cheeks seemed to accentuate her wrinkles. As at the time we saw\r\nher in Manila, she now supported her lame husband on her arm.\r\n\r\n\"I have the pleasure of introducing to you our cousin, Don Alfonso\r\nLinares de Espadaña,\" said Doña Victorina, indicating their young\r\ncompanion. \"The gentleman is a godson of a relative of Padre Damaso's\r\nand has been private secretary to all the ministers.\"\r\n\r\nThe young man bowed politely and Capitan Tiago came very near to\r\nkissing his hand.\r\n\r\nWhile their numerous trunks and traveling-bags are being carried\r\nin and Capitan Tiago is conducting them to their rooms, let us talk\r\na little of this couple whose acquaintance we made slightly in the\r\nfirst chapters.\r\n\r\nDoña Victorina was a lady of forty and five winters, which were\r\nequivalent to thirty and two summers according to her arithmetical\r\ncalculations. She had been beautiful in her youth, having had, as\r\nshe used to say, 'good flesh,' but in the ecstasies of contemplating\r\nherself she had looked with disdain on her many Filipino admirers,\r\nsince her aspirations were toward another race. She had refused to\r\nbestow on any one her little white hand, not indeed from distrust,\r\nfor not a few times had she given jewelry and gems of great value to\r\nvarious foreign and Spanish adventurers. Six months before the time of\r\nour story she had seen realized her most beautiful dream,--the dream\r\nof her whole life,--for which she might scorn the fond illusions\r\nof her youth and even the promises of love that Capitan Tiago had\r\nin other days whispered in her ear or sung in some serenade. Late,\r\nit is true, had the dream been realized, but Doña Victorina, who,\r\nalthough she spoke the language badly, was more Spanish than Augustina\r\nof Saragossa, [115] understood the proverb, \"Better late than never,\"\r\nand found consolation in repeating it to herself. \"Absolute happiness\r\ndoes not exist on earth,\" was another favorite proverb of hers,\r\nbut she never used both together before other persons.\r\n\r\nHaving passed her first, second, third, and fourth youth in casting\r\nher nets in the sea of the world for the object of her vigils, she had\r\nbeen compelled at last to content herself with what fate was willing\r\nto apportion her. Had the poor woman been only thirty and one instead\r\nof thirty and two summers--the difference according to her mode of\r\nreckoning was great--she would have restored to Destiny the award it\r\noffered her to wait for another more suited to her taste, but since\r\nman proposes and necessity disposes, she saw herself obliged in her\r\ngreat need for a husband to content herself with a poor fellow who had\r\nbeen cast out from Estremadura [116] and who, after wandering about\r\nthe world for six or seven years like a modern Ulysses, had at last\r\nfound on the island of Luzon hospitality and a withered Calypso for\r\nhis better half. This unhappy mortal, by name Tiburcio Espadaña, was\r\nonly thirty-five years of age and looked like an old man, yet he was,\r\nnevertheless, younger than Doña Victorina, who was only thirty-two. The\r\nreason for this is easy to understand but dangerous to state.\r\n\r\nDon Tiburcio had come to the Philippines as a petty official in the\r\nCustoms, but such had been his bad luck that, besides suffering\r\nseverely from seasickness and breaking a leg during the voyage,\r\nhe had been dismissed within a fortnight, just at the time when he\r\nfound himself without a cuarto. After his rough experience on the sea\r\nhe did not care to return to Spain without having made his fortune,\r\nso he decided to devote himself to something. Spanish pride forbade\r\nhim to engage in manual labor, although the poor fellow would gladly\r\nhave done any kind of work in order to earn an honest living. But the\r\nprestige of the Spaniards would not have allowed it, even though this\r\nprestige did not protect him from want.\r\n\r\nAt first he had lived at the expense of some of his countrymen, but in\r\nhis honesty the bread tasted bitter, so instead of getting fat he grew\r\nthin. Since he had neither learning nor money nor recommendations he\r\nwas advised by his countrymen, who wished to get rid of him, to go to\r\nthe provinces and pass himself off as a doctor of medicine. He refused\r\nat first, for he had learned nothing during the short period that he\r\nhad spent as an attendant in a hospital, his duties there having been\r\nto dust off the benches and light the fires. But as his wants were\r\npressing and as his scruples were soon laid to rest by his friends\r\nhe finally listened to them and went to the provinces. He began by\r\nvisiting some sick persons, and at first made only moderate charges,\r\nas his conscience dictated, but later, like the young philosopher\r\nof whom Samaniego [117] tells, he ended by putting a higher price\r\non his visits. Thus he soon passed for a great physician and would\r\nprobably have made his fortune if the medical authorities in Manila\r\nhad not heard of his exorbitant fees and the competition that he was\r\ncausing others. Both private parties and professionals interceded for\r\nhim. \"Man,\" they said to the zealous medical official, \"let him make\r\nhis stake and as soon as he has six or seven thousand pesos he can\r\ngo back home and live there in peace. After all, what does it matter\r\nto you if he does deceive the unwary Indians? They should be more\r\ncareful! He's a poor devil--don't take the bread from his mouth--be a\r\ngood Spaniard!\" This official was a good Spaniard and agreed to wink at\r\nthe matter, but the news soon reached the ears of the people and they\r\nbegan to distrust him, so in a little while he lost his practise and\r\nagain saw himself obliged almost to beg his daily bread. It was then\r\nthat he learned through a friend, who was an intimate acquaintance of\r\nDoña Victorina's, of the dire straits in which that lady was placed\r\nand also of her patriotism and her kind heart. Don Tiburcio then saw\r\na patch of blue sky and asked to be introduced to her.\r\n\r\nDoña Victorina and Don Tiburcio met: _tarde venientibus ossa_,\r\n[118] he would have exclaimed had he known Latin! She was no longer\r\npassable, she was passée. Her abundant hair had been reduced to a knot\r\nabout the size of an onion, according to her maid, while her face was\r\nfurrowed with wrinkles and her teeth were falling loose. Her eyes,\r\ntoo, had suffered considerably, so that she squinted frequently in\r\nlooking any distance. Her disposition was the only part of her that\r\nremained intact.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a half-hour's conversation they understood and accepted\r\neach other. She would have preferred a Spaniard who was less lame,\r\nless stuttering, less bald, less toothless, who slobbered less when he\r\ntalked, and who had more \"spirit\" and \"quality,\" as she used to say,\r\nbut that class of Spaniards no longer came to seek her hand. She\r\nhad more than once heard it said that opportunity is pictured as\r\nbeing bald, and firmly believed that Don Tiburcio was opportunity\r\nitself, for as a result of his misfortunes he suffered from premature\r\nbaldness. And what woman is not prudent at thirty-two years of age?\r\n\r\nDon Tiburcio, for his part, felt a vague melancholy when he thought of\r\nhis honeymoon, but smiled with resignation and called to his support\r\nthe specter of hunger. Never had he been ambitious or pretentious; his\r\ntastes were simple and his desires limited; but his heart, untouched\r\ntill then, had dreamed of a very different divinity. Back there in his\r\nyouth when, worn out with work, he lay doom on his rough bed after\r\na frugal meal, he used to fall asleep dreaming of an image, smiling\r\nand tender. Afterwards, when troubles and privations increased and\r\nwith the passing of years the poetical image failed to materialize,\r\nhe thought modestly of a good woman, diligent and industrious, who\r\nwould bring him a small dowry, to console him for the fatigues of\r\nhis toil and to quarrel with him now and then--yes, he had thought of\r\nquarrels as a kind of happiness! But when obliged to wander from land\r\nto land in search not so much of fortune as of some simple means of\r\nlivelihood for the remainder of his days; when, deluded by the stories\r\nof his countrymen from overseas, he had set out for the Philippines,\r\nrealism gave, place to an arrogant mestiza or a beautiful Indian with\r\nbig black eyes, gowned in silks and transparent draperies, loaded\r\ndown with gold and diamonds, offering him her love, her carriages,\r\nher all. When he reached Manila he thought for a time that his dream\r\nwas to be realized, for the young women whom he saw driving on the\r\nLuneta and the Malecon in silver-mounted carriages had gazed at him\r\nwith some curiosity. Then after his position was gone, the mestiza and\r\nthe Indian disappeared and with great effort he forced before himself\r\nthe image of a widow, of course an agreeable widow! So when he saw\r\nhis dream take shape in part he became sad, but with a certain touch\r\nof native philosophy said to himself, \"Those were all dreams and in\r\nthis world one does not live on dreams!\" Thus he dispelled his doubts:\r\nshe used rice-powder, but after their marriage he would break her\r\nof the habit; her face had many wrinkles, but his coat was torn and\r\npatched; she was a pretentious old woman, domineering and mannish,\r\nbut hunger was more terrible, more domineering and pretentious still,\r\nand anyway, he had been blessed with a mild disposition for that very\r\nend, and love softens the character. She spoke Spanish badly, but he\r\nhimself did not talk it well, as he had been told when notified of his\r\ndismissal Moreover, what did it matter to him if she was an ugly and\r\nridiculous old woman? He was lame, toothless, and bald! Don Tiburcio\r\npreferred to take charge of her rather than to become a public charge\r\nfrom hunger. When some friends joked with him about it, he answered,\r\n\"Give me bread and call me a fool.\"\r\n\r\nDon Tiburcio was one of those men who are popularly spoken of as\r\nunwilling to harm a fly. Modest, incapable of harboring an unkind\r\nthought, in bygone days he would have been made a missionary. His stay\r\nin the country had not given him the conviction of grand superiority,\r\nof great valor, and of elevated importance that the greater part\r\nof his countrymen acquire in a few weeks. His heart had never been\r\ncapable of entertaining hate nor had he been able to find a single\r\nfilibuster; he saw only unhappy wretches whom he must despoil if he\r\ndid not wish to be more unhappy than they were. When he was threatened\r\nwith prosecution for passing himself off as a physician he was not\r\nresentful nor did he complain. Recognizing the justness of the charge\r\nagainst him, he merely answered, \"But it's necessary to live!\"\r\n\r\nSo they married, or rather, bagged each other, and went to Santa Ann\r\nto spend their honeymoon. But on their wedding-night Doña Victorina\r\nwas attacked by a horrible indigestion and Don Tiburcio thanked God\r\nand showed himself solicitous and attentive. A few days afterward,\r\nhowever, he looked into a mirror and smiled a sad smile as he gazed\r\nat his naked gums, for he had aged ten years at least.\r\n\r\nVery well satisfied with her husband, Doña Victorina had a fine\r\nset of false teeth made for him and called in the best tailors of\r\nthe city to attend to his clothing. She ordered carriages, sent to\r\nBatangas and Albay for the best ponies, and even obliged him to keep a\r\npair for the races. Nor did she neglect her own person while she was\r\ntransforming him. She laid aside the native costume for the European\r\nand substituted false frizzes for the simple Filipino coiffure, while\r\nher gowns, which fitted her marvelously ill, disturbed the peace of\r\nall the quiet neighborhood.\r\n\r\nHer husband, who never went out on foot,--she did not care to have his\r\nlameness noticed,--took her on lonely drives in unfrequented places to\r\nher great sorrow, for she wanted to show him off in public, but she\r\nkept quiet out of respect for their honeymoon. The last quarter was\r\ncoming on when he took up the subject of the rice-powder, telling her\r\nthat the use of it was false and unnatural. Doña Victorina wrinkled\r\nup her eyebrows and stared at his false teeth. He became silent,\r\nand she understood his weakness.\r\n\r\nShe placed a _de_ before her husband's surname, since the _de_ cost\r\nnothing and gave \"quality\" to the name, signing herself \"Victorina\r\nde los Reyes _de_ De Espadaña.\" This _de_ was such a mania with her\r\nthat neither the stationer nor her husband could get it out of her\r\nhead. \"If I write only one _de_ it may be thought that you don't have\r\nit, you fool!\" she said to her husband. [119]\r\n\r\nSoon she believed that she was about to become a mother, so she\r\nannounced to all her acquaintances, \"Next month De Espadaña and I are\r\ngoing to the _Penyinsula_. I don't want our son to be born here and\r\nbe called a revolutionist.\" She talked incessantly of the journey,\r\nhaving memorized the names of the different ports of call, so that\r\nit was a treat to hear her talk: \"I'm going to see the isthmus in the\r\nSuez Canal--De Espadaña thinks it very beautiful and De Espadaña has\r\ntraveled over the whole world.\" \"I'll probably not return to this\r\nland of savages.\" \"I wasn't born to live here--Aden or Port Said\r\nwould suit me better--I've thought so ever since I was a girl.\" In\r\nher geography Doña Victorina divided the world into the Philippines\r\nand Spain; rather differently from the clever people who divide it\r\ninto Spain and America or China for another name.\r\n\r\nHer husband realized that these things were barbarisms, but held his\r\npeace to escape a scolding or reminders of his stuttering. To increase\r\nthe illusion of approaching maternity she became whimsical, dressed\r\nherself in colors with a profusion of flowers and ribbons, and appeared\r\non the Escolta in a wrapper. But oh, the disenchantment! Three months\r\nwent by and the dream faded, and now, having no reason for fearing\r\nthat her son would be a revolutionist, she gave up the trip. She\r\nconsulted doctors, midwives, old women, but all in vain. Having to the\r\ngreat displeasure of Capitan Tiago jested about St. Pascual Bailon,\r\nshe was unwilling to appeal to any saint. For this reason a friend\r\nof her husband's remarked to her:\r\n\r\n\"Believe me, señora, you are the only _strong-spirited_ person in\r\nthis tiresome country.\"\r\n\r\nShe had smiled, without knowing what _strong-spirited_ meant, but that\r\nnight she asked her husband. \"My dear,\" he answered, \"the s-strongest\r\ns-spirit that I know of is ammonia. My f-friend must have s-spoken\r\nf-figuratively.\"\r\n\r\nAfter that she would say on every possible occasion, \"I'm the only\r\nammonia in this tiresome country, speaking figuratively. So Señor\r\nN. de N., a Peninsular gentleman of quality, told me.\"\r\n\r\nWhatever she said had to be done, for she had succeeded in dominating\r\nher husband completely. He on his part did not put up any great\r\nresistance and so was converted into a kind of lap-dog of hers. If\r\nshe was displeased with him she would not let him go out, and when\r\nshe was really angry she tore out his false teeth, thus leaving him\r\na horrible sight for several days.\r\n\r\nIt soon occurred to her that her husband ought to be a doctor of\r\nmedicine and surgery, and she so informed him.\r\n\r\n\"My dear, do you w-want me to be arrested?\" he asked fearfully.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be a fool! Leave me to arrange it,\" she answered. \"You're\r\nnot going to treat any one, but I want people to call you _Doctor_\r\nand me _Doctora_, see?\"\r\n\r\nSo on the following day Rodoreda [120] received an order to engrave on\r\na slab of black marble: DR. DE ESPADAÑA, SPECIALIST IN ALL KINDS OF\r\nDISEASES. All the servants had to address them by their new titles,\r\nand as a result she increased the number of frizzes, the layers of\r\nrice-powder, the ribbons and laces, and gazed with more disdain than\r\never on her poor and unfortunate countrywomen whose husbands belonged\r\nto a lower grade of society than hers did. Day by day she felt more\r\ndignified and exalted and, by continuing in this way, at the end of\r\na year she would have believed herself to be of divine origin.\r\n\r\nThese sublime thoughts, however, did not keep her from becoming older\r\nand more ridiculous every day. Every time Capitan Tiago saw her and\r\nrecalled having made love to her in vain he forthwith sent a peso to\r\nthe church for a mass of thanksgiving. Still, he greatly respected her\r\nhusband on account of his title of specialist in all kinds of diseases\r\nand listened attentively to the few phrases that he was able to stutter\r\nout. For this reason and because this doctor was more exclusive than\r\nothers, Capitan Tiago had selected him to treat his daughter.\r\n\r\nIn regard to young Linares, that is another matter. When arranging for\r\nthe trip to Spain, Doña Victorina had thought of having a Peninsular\r\nadministrator, as she did not trust the Filipinos. Her husband\r\nbethought himself of a nephew of his in Madrid who was studying law\r\nand who was considered the brightest of the family. So they wrote to\r\nhim, paying his passage in advance, and when the dream disappeared\r\nhe was already on his way.\r\n\r\nSuch were the three persons who had just arrived. While they were\r\npartaking of a late breakfast, Padre Salvi came in. The Espadañas\r\nwere already acquainted with him, and they introduced the blushing\r\nyoung Linares with all his titles.\r\n\r\nAs was natural, they talked of Maria Clara, who was resting and\r\nsleeping. They talked of their journey, and Doña Victorina exhibited\r\nall her verbosity in criticising the customs of the provincials,--their\r\nnipa houses, their bamboo bridges; without forgetting to mention to\r\nthe curate her intimacy with this and that high official and other\r\npersons of \"quality\" who were very fond of her.\r\n\r\n\"If you had come two days ago, Doña Victorina,\" put in Capitan\r\nTiago during a slight pause, \"you would have met his Excellency,\r\nthe Captain-General. He sat right there.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! How's that? His Excellency here! In your house? No!\"\r\n\r\n\"I tell you that he sat right there. If you had only come two days\r\nago--\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, what a pity that Clarita did not get sick sooner!\" she exclaimed\r\nwith real feeling. Then turning to Linares, \"Do you hear, cousin? His\r\nExcellency was here! Don't you see now that De Espadaña was right\r\nwhen he told you that you weren't going to the house of a miserable\r\nIndian? Because, you know, Don Santiago, in Madrid our cousin was\r\nthe friend of ministers and dukes and dined in the house of Count\r\nEl Campanario.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Duke of La Torte, Victorina,\" corrected her husband. [121]\r\n\r\n\"It's the same thing. If you will tell me--\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall I find Padre Damaso in his town?\" interrupted Linares,\r\naddressing Padre Salvi. \"I've been told that it's near here.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's right here and will be over in a little while,\" replied the\r\ncurate.\r\n\r\n\"How glad I am of that! I have a letter to him,\" exclaimed the youth,\r\n\"and if it were not for the happy chance that brings me here, I would\r\nhave come expressly to visit him.\"\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the _happy_ chance had awakened.\r\n\r\n\"De Espadaña,\" said Doña Victorina, when the meal was over, \"shall\r\nwe go in to see Clarita?\" Then to Capitan Tiago, \"Only for you, Don\r\nSantiago, only for you! My husband only attends persons of quality,\r\nand yet, and yet--! He's not like those here. In Madrid he only\r\nvisited persons of quality.\"\r\n\r\nThey adjourned to the sick girl's chamber. The windows were closed\r\nfrom fear of a draught, so the room was almost dark, being only\r\ndimly illuminated by two tapers which burned before an image of the\r\nVirgin of Antipolo. Her head covered with a handkerchief saturated\r\nin cologne, her body wrapped carefully in white sheets which swathed\r\nher youthful form with many folds, under curtains of jusi and piña,\r\nthe girl lay on her kamagon bed. Her hair formed a frame around her\r\noval countenance and accentuated her transparent paleness, which\r\nwas enlivened only by her large, sad eyes. At her side were her two\r\nfriends and Andeng with a bouquet of tuberoses.\r\n\r\nDe Espadaña felt her pulse, examined her tongue, asked a few questions,\r\nand said, as he wagged his head from side to side, \"S-she's s-sick,\r\nbut s-she c-can be c-cured.\" Doña Victorina looked proudly at the\r\nbystanders.\r\n\r\n\"Lichen with milk in the morning, syrup of marshmallow, two cynoglossum\r\npills!\" ordered De Espadaña.\r\n\r\n\"Cheer up, Clarita!\" said Doña Victorina, going up to her. \"We've\r\ncome to cure you. I want to introduce our cousin.\"\r\n\r\nLinares was so absorbed in the contemplation of those eloquent eyes,\r\nwhich seemed to be searching for some one, that he did not hear Doña\r\nVictorina name him.\r\n\r\n\"Señor Linares,\" said the curate, calling him out of his abstraction,\r\n\"here comes Padre Damaso.\"\r\n\r\nIt was indeed Padre Damaso, but pale and rather sad. On leaving his\r\nbed his first visit was for Maria Clara. Nor was it the Padre Damaso\r\nof former times, hearty and self-confident; now he moved silently\r\nand with some hesitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII\r\n\r\nPlans\r\n\r\n\r\nWithout heeding any of the bystanders, Padre Damaso went directly\r\nto the bed of the sick girl and taking her hand said to her with\r\nineffable tenderness, while tears sprang into his eyes, \"Maria,\r\nmy daughter, you mustn't die!\"\r\n\r\nThe sick girl opened her eyes and stared at him with a strange\r\nexpression. No one who knew the Franciscan had suspected in him such\r\ntender feelings, no one had believed that under his rude and rough\r\nexterior there might beat a heart. Unable to go on, he withdrew from\r\nthe girl's side, weeping like a child, and went outside under the\r\nfavorite vines of Maria Clara's balcony to give free rein to his grief.\r\n\r\n\"How he loves his goddaughter!\" thought all present, while Fray Salvi\r\ngazed at him motionlessly and in silence, lightly gnawing his lips\r\nthe while.\r\n\r\nWhen he had become somewhat calm again Doña Victorina introduced\r\nLinares, who approached him respectfully. Fray Damaso silently looked\r\nhim over from head to foot, took the letter offered and read it,\r\nbut apparently without understanding, for he asked, \"And who are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Alfonso Linares, the godson of your brother-in-law,\" stammered the\r\nyoung man.\r\n\r\nPadre Damaso threw back his body and looked the youth over again\r\ncarefully. Then his features lighted up and he arose. \"So you are the\r\ngodson of Carlicos!\" he exclaimed. \"Come and let me embrace you! I\r\ngot your letter several days ago. So it's you! I didn't recognize\r\nyou,--which is easily explained, for you weren't born when I left the\r\ncountry,--I didn't recognize you!\" Padre Damaso squeezed his robust\r\narms about the young man, who became very red, whether from modesty\r\nor lack of breath is not known.\r\n\r\nAfter the first moments of effusion had passed and inquiries about\r\nCarlicos and his wife had been made and answered, Padre Damaso asked,\r\n\"Come now, what does Carlicos want me to do for you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe he says something about that in the letter,\" Linares\r\nagain stammered.\r\n\r\n\"In the letter? Let's see! That's right! He wants me to get you a job\r\nand a wife. Ahem! A job, a job that's easy! Can you read and write?\"\r\n\r\n\"I received my degree of law from the University.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Carambas!_ So you're a pettifogger! You don't show it; you look\r\nmore like a shy maiden. So much the better! But to get you a wife--\"\r\n\r\n\"Padre, I'm not in such a great hurry,\" interrupted Linares in\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\nBut Padre Damaso was already pacing from one end of the hallway to\r\nthe other, muttering, \"A wife, a wife!\" His countenance was no longer\r\nsad or merry but now wore an expression of great seriousness, while\r\nhe seemed to be thinking deeply. Padre Salvi gazed on the scene from\r\na distance.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't think that the matter would trouble me so much,\" murmured\r\nPadre Damaso in a tearful voice. \"But of two evils, the lesser!\" Then\r\nraising his voice he approached Linares and said to him, \"Come, boy,\r\nlet's talk to Santiago.\"\r\n\r\nLinares turned pale and allowed himself to be dragged along by the\r\npriest, who moved thoughtfully. Then it was Padre Salvi's turn to\r\npace back and forth, pensive as ever.\r\n\r\nA voice wishing him good morning drew him from his monotonous walk. He\r\nraised his head and saw Lucas, who saluted him humbly.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want?\" questioned the curate's eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Padre, I'm the brother of the man who was killed on the day of the\r\nfiesta,\" began Lucas in tearful accents.\r\n\r\nThe curate recoiled and murmured in a scarcely audible voice, \"Well?\"\r\n\r\nLucas made an effort to weep and wiped his eyes with a\r\nhandkerchief. \"Padre,\" he went on tearfully, \"I've been to Don\r\nCrisostomo to ask for an indemnity. First he received me with kicks,\r\nsaying that he wouldn't pay anything since he himself had run the risk\r\nof getting killed through the fault of my dear, unfortunate brother. I\r\nwent to talk to him yesterday, but he had gone to Manila. He left\r\nme five hundred pesos for charity's sake and charged me not to come\r\nback again. Ah, Padre, five hundred pesos for my poor brother--five\r\nhundred pesos! Ah, Padre--\"\r\n\r\nAt first the curate had listened with surprise and attention while\r\nhis lips curled slightly with a smile of such disdain and sarcasm\r\nat the sight of this farce that, had Lucas noticed it, he would have\r\nrun away at top speed. \"Now what do you want?\" he asked, turning away.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Padre, tell me for the love of God what I ought to do. The padre\r\nhas always given good advice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who told you so? You don't belong in these parts.\"\r\n\r\n\"The padre is known all over the province.\"\r\n\r\nWith irritated looks Padre Salvi approached him and pointing to the\r\nstreet said to the now startled Lucas, \"Go home and be thankful that\r\nDon Crisostomo didn't have you sent to jail! Get out of here!\"\r\n\r\nLucas forgot the part he was playing and murmured, \"But I thought--\"\r\n\r\n\"Get out of here!\" cried Padre Salvi nervously.\r\n\r\n\"I would like to see Padre Damaso.\"\r\n\r\n\"Padre Damaso is busy. Get out of here!\" again ordered the curate\r\nimperiously.\r\n\r\nLucas went down the stairway muttering, \"He's another of them--as he\r\ndoesn't pay well--the one who pays best!\"\r\n\r\nAt the sound of the curate's voice all had hurried to the spot,\r\nincluding Padre Damaso, Capitan Tiago, and Linares.\r\n\r\n\"An insolent vagabond who came to beg and who doesn't want to work,\"\r\nexplained Padre Salvi, picking up his hat and cane to return to\r\nthe convento.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV\r\n\r\nAn Examination of Conscience\r\n\r\n\r\nLong days and weary nights passed at the sick girl's bed. After having\r\nconfessed herself, Maria Clara had suffered a relapse, and in her\r\ndelirium she uttered only the name of the mother whom she had never\r\nknown. But her girl friends, her father, and her aunt kept watch at\r\nher side. Offerings and alms were sent to all the miraculous images,\r\nCapitan Tiago vowed a gold cane to the Virgin of Antipolo, and at\r\nlength the fever began to subside slowly and regularly.\r\n\r\nDoctor De Espadaña was astonished at the virtues of the syrup of\r\nmarshmallow and the infusion of lichen, prescriptions that he had not\r\nvaried. Doña Victorina was so pleased with her husband that one day\r\nwhen he stepped on the train of her gown she did not apply her penal\r\ncode to the extent of taking his set of false teeth away from him,\r\nbut contented herself with merely exclaiming, \"If you weren't lame\r\nyou'd even step on my corset!\"--an article of apparel she did not wear.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon while Sinang and Victoria were visiting their friend,\r\nthe curate, Capitan Tiago, and Doña Victorina's family were conversing\r\nover their lunch in the dining-room.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I feel very sorry about it,\" said the doctor; \"Padre Damaso\r\nalso will regret it very much.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where do you say they're transferring him to?\" Linares asked the\r\ncurate.\r\n\r\n\"To the province of Tayabas,\" replied the curate negligently.\r\n\r\n\"One who will be greatly affected by it is Maria Clara, when she\r\nlearns of it,\" said Capitan Tiago. \"She loves him like a father.\"\r\n\r\nFray Salvi looked at him askance.\r\n\r\n\"I believe, Padre,\" continued Capitan Tiago, \"that all her illness\r\nis the result of the trouble on the last day of the fiesta.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm of the same opinion, and think that you've done well not to let\r\nSeñor Ibarra see her. She would have got worse.\r\n\r\n\"If it wasn't for us,\" put in Doña Victorina, \"Clarita would already\r\nbe in heaven singing praises to God.\"\r\n\r\n\"Amen!\" Capitan Tiago thought it his duty to exclaim. \"It's lucky\r\nfor you that my husband didn't have any patient of greater quality,\r\nfor then you'd have had to call in another, and all those here are\r\nignoramuses. My husband--\"\r\n\r\n\"Just as I was saying,\" the curate in turn interrupted, \"I think that\r\nthe confession that Maria Clara made brought on the favorable crisis\r\nwhich has saved her life. A clean conscience is worth more than a lot\r\nof medicine. Don't think that I deny the power of science, above all,\r\nthat of surgery, but a clean conscience! Read the pious books and\r\nyou'll see how many cures are effected merely by a clean confession.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me,\" objected the piqued Doña Victorina, \"this power of the\r\nconfessional--cure the alferez's woman with a confession!\"\r\n\r\n\"A wound, madam, is not a form of illness which the conscience\r\ncan affect,\" replied Padre Salvi severely. \"Nevertheless, a clean\r\nconfession will preserve her from receiving in the future such blows\r\nas she got this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"She deserves them!\" went on Doña Victorina as if she had not heard\r\nwhat Padre Salvi said. \"That woman is so insolent! In the church she\r\ndid nothing but stare at me. You can see that she's a nobody. Sunday\r\nI was going to ask her if she saw anything funny about my face,\r\nbut who would lower oneself to speak to people that are not of rank?\"\r\n\r\nThe curate, on his part, continued just as though he had not heard\r\nthis tirade. \"Believe me, Don Santiago, to complete your daughter's\r\nrecovery it's necessary that she take communion tomorrow. I'll bring\r\nthe viaticum over here. I don't think she has anything to confess,\r\nbut yet, if she wants to confess herself tonight--\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" Doña Victorina instantly took advantage of a slight\r\nhesitation on Padre Salvi's part to add, \"I don't understand how\r\nthere can be men capable of marrying such a fright as that woman\r\nis. It's easily seen where she comes from. She's just dying of envy,\r\nyou can see it! How much does an alferez get?\"\r\n\r\n\"Accordingly, Don Santiago, tell your cousin to prepare the sick girl\r\nfor the communion tomorrow. I'll come over tonight to absolve her of\r\nher peccadillos.\"\r\n\r\nSeeing Aunt Isabel come from the sick-room, he said to her in Tagalog,\r\n\"Prepare your niece for confession tonight. Tomorrow I'll bring over\r\nthe viaticum. With that she'll improve faster.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Padre,\" Linares gathered up enough courage to ask faintly,\r\n\"you don't think that she's in any danger of dying?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you worry,\" answered the padre without looking at him. \"I\r\nknow what I'm doing; I've helped take care of plenty of sick people\r\nbefore. Besides, she'll decide herself whether or not she wishes to\r\nreceive the holy communion and you'll see that she says yes.\"\r\n\r\nCapitan Tiago immediately agreed to everything, while Aunt Isabel\r\nreturned to the sick girl's chamber. Maria Clara was still in bed,\r\npale, very pale, and at her side were her two friends.\r\n\r\n\"Take one more grain,\" Sinang whispered, as she offered her a white\r\ntablet that she took from a small glass tube. \"He says that when you\r\nfeel a rumbling or buzzing in your ears you are to stop the medicine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hasn't he written to you again?\" asked the sick girl in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\"No, he must be very busy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hasn't he sent any message?\"\r\n\r\n\"He says nothing more than that he's going to try to get the Archbishop\r\nto absolve him from the excommunication, so that--\"\r\n\r\nThis conversation was suspended at the aunt's approach. \"The\r\npadre says for you to get ready for confession, daughter,\" said the\r\nlatter. \"You girls must leave her so that she can make her examination\r\nof conscience.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it hasn't been a week since she confessed!\" protested Sinang. \"I'm\r\nnot sick and I don't sin as often as that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Abá! Don't you know what the curate says: the righteous sin seven\r\ntimes a day? Come, what book shall I bring you, the _Ancora_, the\r\n_Ramillete_, or the _Camino Recto para ir al Cielo?_\"\r\n\r\nMaria Clara did not answer.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you mustn't tire yourself,\" added the good aunt to console\r\nher. \"I'll read the examination myself and you'll have only to recall\r\nyour sins.\"\r\n\r\n\"Write to him not to think of me any more,\" murmured Maria Clara in\r\nSinang's ear as the latter said good-by to her.\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\nBut the aunt again approached, and Sinang had to go away without\r\nunderstanding what her friend had meant. The good old aunt drew a\r\nchair up to the light, put her spectacles on the end of her nose, and\r\nopened a booklet. \"Pay close attention, daughter. I'm going to begin\r\nwith the Ten Commandments. I'll go slow so that you can meditate. If\r\nyou don't hear well tell me so that I can repeat. You know that in\r\nlooking after your welfare I'm never weary.\"\r\n\r\nShe began to read in a monotonous and snuffling voice the\r\nconsiderations of cases of sinfulness. At the end of each paragraph\r\nshe made a long pause in order to give the girl time to recall her\r\nsins and to repent of them.\r\n\r\nMaria Clara stared vaguely into space. After finishing the first\r\ncommandment, _to love God above all things_, Aunt Isabel looked at\r\nher over her spectacles and was satisfied with her sad and thoughtful\r\nmien. She coughed piously and after a long pause began to read the\r\nsecond commandment. The good old woman read with unction and when she\r\nhad finished the commentaries looked again at her niece, who turned\r\nher head slowly to the other side.\r\n\r\n\"Bah!\" said Aunt Isabel to herself. \"With taking His holy name in vain\r\nthe poor child has nothing to do. Let's pass on to the third.\" [122]\r\n\r\nThe third commandment was analyzed and commented upon. After citing\r\nall the cases in which one can break it she again looked toward the\r\nbed. But now she lifted up her glasses and rubbed her eyes, for she\r\nhad seen her niece raise a handkerchief to her face as if to wipe\r\naway tears.\r\n\r\n\"Hum, ahem! The poor child once went to sleep during the sermon.\" Then\r\nreplacing her glasses on the end of her nose, she said, \"Now let's\r\nsee if, just as you've failed to keep holy the Sabbath, you've failed\r\nto honor your father and mother.\"\r\n\r\nSo she read the fourth commandment in an even slower and more snuffling\r\nvoice, thinking thus to give solemnity to the act, just as she had\r\nseen many friars do. Aunt Isabel had never heard a Quaker preach or\r\nshe would also have trembled.\r\n\r\nThe sick girl, in the meantime, raised the handkerchief to her eyes\r\nseveral times and her breathing became more noticeable.\r\n\r\n\"What a good soul!\" thought the old woman. \"She who is so obedient\r\nand submissive to every one! I've committed more sins and yet I've\r\nnever been able really to cry.\"\r\n\r\nShe then began the fifth commandment with greater pauses and even\r\nmore pronounced snuffling, if that were possible, and with such great\r\nenthusiasm that she did not hear the stifled sobs of her niece. Only\r\nin a pause which she made after the comments on homicide, by violence\r\ndid she notice the groans of the sinner. Then her tone passed into the\r\nsublime as she read the rest of the commandment in accents that she\r\ntried to reader threatening, seeing that her niece was still weeping.\r\n\r\n\"Weep, daughter, weep!\" she said, approaching the bed. \"The more you\r\nweep the sooner God will pardon you. Hold the sorrow of repentance as\r\nbetter than that of mere penitence. Weep, daughter, weep! You don't\r\nknow how much I enjoy seeing you weep. Beat yourself on the breast\r\nalso, but not hard, for you're still sick.\"\r\n\r\nBut, as if her sorrow needed mystery and solitude to make it increase,\r\nMaria Clara, on seeing herself observed, little by little stopped\r\nsighing and dried her eyes without saying anything or answering her\r\naunt, who continued the reading. Since the wails of her audience had\r\nceased, however, she lost her enthusiasm, and the last commandments\r\nmade her so sleepy that she began to yawn, with great detriment to\r\nher snuffling, which was thus interrupted.\r\n\r\n\"If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn't have believed it,\"\r\nthought the good old lady afterwards. \"This girl sins like a soldier\r\nagainst the first five and from the sixth to the tenth not a venial\r\nsin, just the opposite to us! How the world does move now!\"\r\n\r\nSo she lighted a large candle to the Virgin of Antipolo and two other\r\nsmaller ones to Our Lady of the Rosary and Our Lady of the Pillar,\r\n[123] taking care to put away in a corner a marble crucifix to make\r\nit understand that the candles were not lighted for it. Nor did the\r\nVirgin of Delaroche have any share; she was an unknown foreigner,\r\nand Aunt Isabel had never heard of any miracle of hers.\r\n\r\nWe do not know what occurred during the confession that night and we\r\nrespect such secrets. But the confession was a long one and the aunt,\r\nwho stood watch over her niece at a distance, could note that the\r\ncurate, instead of turning his ear to hear the words of the sick girl,\r\nrather had his face turned toward hers, and seemed only to be trying\r\nto read, or divine, her thoughts by gazing into her beautiful eyes.\r\n\r\nPale and with contracted lips Padre Salvi left the chamber. Looking\r\nat his forehead, which was gloomy and covered with perspiration,\r\none would have said that it was he who had confessed and had not\r\nobtained absolution.\r\n\r\n\"_Jesús, María, y José!_\" exclaimed Aunt Isabel, crossing herself to\r\ndispel an evil thought, \"who understands the girls nowadays?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV\r\n\r\nThe Hunted\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the dim light shed by the moonbeams sifting through the thick\r\nfoliage a man wandered through the forest with slow and cautious\r\nsteps. From time to time, as if to find his way, he whistled a peculiar\r\nmelody, which was answered in the distance by some one whistling the\r\nsame air. The man would listen attentively and then make his way in\r\nthe direction of the distant sound, until at length, after overcoming\r\nthe thousand obstacles offered by the virgin forest in the night-time,\r\nhe reached a small open space, which was bathed in the light of the\r\nmoon in its first quarter. The high, tree-crowned rocks that rose\r\nabout formed a kind of ruined amphitheater, in the center of which\r\nwere scattered recently felled trees and charred logs among boulders\r\ncovered with nature's mantle of verdure.\r\n\r\nScarcely had the unknown arrived when another figure started suddenly\r\nfrom behind a large rock and advanced with drawn revolver. \"Who are\r\nyou?\" he asked in Tagalog in an imperious tone, cocking the weapon.\r\n\r\n\"Is old Pablo among you?\" inquired the unknown in an even tone,\r\nwithout answering the question or showing any signs of fear.\r\n\r\n\"You mean the capitan? Yes, he's here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then tell him that Elias is here looking for him,\" was the answer\r\nof the unknown, who was no other than the mysterious pilot.\r\n\r\n\"Are you Elias?\" asked the other respectfully, as he approached him,\r\nnot, however, ceasing to cover him with the revolver. \"Then come!\"\r\n\r\nElias followed him, and they penetrated into a kind of cave sunk\r\ndown in the depths of the earth. The guide, who seemed to be familiar\r\nwith the way, warned the pilot when he should descend or turn aside\r\nor stoop down, so they were not long in reaching a kind of hall\r\nwhich was poorly lighted by pitch torches and occupied by twelve to\r\nfifteen armed men with dirty faces and soiled clothing, some seated\r\nand some lying down as they talked fitfully to one another. Resting\r\nhis arms on a stone that served for a table and gazing thoughtfully\r\nat the torches, which gave out so little light for so much smoke,\r\nwas seen an old, sad-featured man with his head wrapped in a bloody\r\nbandage. Did we not know that it was a den of tulisanes we might have\r\nsaid, on reading the look of desperation in the old man's face, that\r\nit was the Tower of Hunger on the eve before Ugolino devoured his sons.\r\n\r\nUpon the arrival of Elias and his guide the figures partly rose,\r\nbut at a signal from the latter they settled back again, satisfying\r\nthemselves with the observation that the newcomer was unarmed. The\r\nold man turned his head slowly and saw the quiet figure of Elias,\r\nwho stood uncovered, gazing at him with sad interest.\r\n\r\n\"It's you at last,\" murmured the old man, his gaze lighting up somewhat\r\nas he recognized the youth.\r\n\r\n\"In what condition do I find you!\" exclaimed the youth in a suppressed\r\ntone, shaking his head.\r\n\r\nThe old man dropped his head in silence and made a sign to the others,\r\nwho arose and withdrew, first taking the measure of the pilot's\r\nmuscles and stature with a glance.\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\" said the old man to Elias as soon as they were alone. \"Six\r\nmonths ago when I sheltered you in my house, it was I who pitied\r\nyou. Now we have changed parts and it is you who pity me. But sit\r\ndown and tell me how you got here.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's fifteen days now since I was told of your misfortune,\" began the\r\nyoung man slowly in a low voice as he stared at the light. \"I started\r\nat once and have been seeking you from mountain to mountain. I've\r\ntraveled over nearly the whole of two provinces.\"\r\n\r\n\"In order not to shed innocent blood,\" continued the old man, \"I\r\nhave had to flee. My enemies were afraid to show themselves. I was\r\nconfronted merely with some unfortunates who have never done me the\r\nleast harm.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a brief pause during which he seemed to be occupied in trying\r\nto read the thoughts in the dark countenance of the old man, Elias\r\nreplied: \"I've come to make a proposition to you. Having sought in vain\r\nfor some survivor of the family that caused the misfortunes of mine,\r\nI've decided to leave the province where I live and move toward the\r\nNorth among the independent pagan tribes. Don't you want to abandon\r\nthe life you have entered upon and come with me? I will be your son,\r\nsince you have lost your own; I have no family, and in you will find\r\na father.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man shook his, head in negation, saying, \"When one at my\r\nage makes a desperate resolution, it's because there is no other\r\nrecourse. A man who, like myself, has spent his youth and his mature\r\nyears toiling for the future of himself and his sons; a man who has\r\nbeen submissive to every wish of his superiors, who has conscientiously\r\nperformed difficult tasks, enduring all that he might live in peace and\r\nquiet--when that man, whose blood time has chilled, renounces all his\r\npast and foregoes all his future, even on the very brink of the grave,\r\nit is because he has with mature judgment decided that peace does\r\nnot exist and that it is not the highest good. Why drag out miserable\r\ndays on foreign soil? I had two sons, a daughter, a home, a fortune,\r\nI was esteemed and respected; now I am as a tree shorn of its branches,\r\na wanderer, a fugitive, hunted like a wild beast through the forest,\r\nand all for what? Because a man dishonored my daughter, because her\r\nbrothers called that man's infamy to account, and because that man\r\nis set above his fellows with the title of minister of God! In spite\r\nof everything, I, her father, I, dishonored in my old age, forgave\r\nthe injury, for I was indulgent with the passions of youth and the\r\nweakness of the flesh, and in the face of irreparable wrong what could\r\nI do but hold my peace and save what remained to me? But the culprit,\r\nfearful of vengeance sooner or later, sought the destruction of my\r\nsons. Do you know what he did? No? You don't know, then, that he\r\npretended that there had been a robbery committed in the convento\r\nand that one of my sons figured among the accused? The other could\r\nnot be included because he was in another place at the time. Do you\r\nknow what tortures they were subjected to? You know of them, for\r\nthey are the same in all the towns! I, I saw my son hanging by the\r\nhair, I heard his cries, I heard him call upon me, and I, coward and\r\nlover of peace, hadn't the courage either to kill or to die! Do you\r\nknow that the theft was not proved, that it was shown to be a false\r\ncharge, and that in punishment the curate was transferred to another\r\ntown, but that my son died as a result of his tortures? The other,\r\nthe one who was left to me, was not a coward like his father, so our\r\npersecutor was still fearful that he would wreak vengeance on him,\r\nand, under the pretext of his not having his cedula, [124] which he\r\nhad not carried with him just at that time, had him arrested by the\r\nCivil Guard, mistreated him, enraged and harassed him with insults\r\nuntil he was driven to suicide! And I, I have outlived so much shame;\r\nbut if I had not the courage of a father to defend my sons, there yet\r\nremains to me a heart burning for revenge, and I will have it! The\r\ndiscontented are gathering under my command, my enemies increase\r\nmy forces, and on the day that I feel myself strong enough I will\r\ndescend to the lowlands and in flames sate my vengeance and end my\r\nown existence. And that day will come or there is no God!\" [125]\r\n\r\nThe old man arose trembling. With fiery look and hollow voice, he\r\nadded, tearing his long hair, \"Curses, curses upon me that I restrained\r\nthe avenging hands of my sons--I have murdered them! Had I let the\r\nguilty perish, had I confided less in the justice of God and men, I\r\nshould now have my sons--fugitives, perhaps, but I should have them;\r\nthey would not have died under torture! I was not born to be a father,\r\nso I have them not! Curses upon me that I had not learned with my\r\nyears to know the conditions under which I lived! But in fire and\r\nblood by my own death I will avenge them!\"\r\n\r\nIn his paroxysm of grief the unfortunate father tore away the bandage,\r\nreopening a wound in his forehead from which gushed a stream of blood.\r\n\r\n\"I respect your sorrow,\" said Elias, \"and I understand your desire\r\nfor revenge. I, too, am like you, and yet from fear of injuring the\r\ninnocent I prefer to forget my misfortunes.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can forget because you are young and because you haven't lost a\r\nson, your last hope! But I assure you that I shall injure no innocent\r\none. Do you see this wound? Rather than kill a poor cuadrillero,\r\nwho was doing his duty, I let him inflict it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But look,\" urged Elias, after a moment's silence, \"look what a\r\nfrightful catastrophe you are going to bring down upon our unfortunate\r\npeople. If you accomplish your revenge by your own hand, your enemies\r\nwill make terrible reprisals, not against you, not against those who\r\nare armed, but against the peaceful, who as usual will be accused--and\r\nthen the eases of injustice!\"\r\n\r\n\"Let the people learn to defend themselves, let each one defend\r\nhimself!\"\r\n\r\n\"You know that that is impossible. Sir, I knew you in other days when\r\nyou were happy; then you gave me good advice, will you now permit me--\"\r\n\r\nThe old man folded his arms in an attitude of attention. \"Sir,\"\r\ncontinued Elias, weighing his words well, \"I have had the good\r\nfortune to render a service to a young man who is rich, generous,\r\nnoble, and who desires the welfare of his country. They say that\r\nthis young man has friends in Madrid--I don't know myself--but I\r\ncan assure you that he is a friend of the Captain-General's. What\r\ndo you say that we make him the bearer of the people's complaints,\r\nif we interest him in the cause of the unhappy?\"\r\n\r\nThe old man shook his head. \"You say that he is rich? The rich think\r\nonly of increasing their wealth, pride and show blind them, and as\r\nthey are generally safe, above all when they have powerful friends,\r\nnone of them troubles himself about the woes of the unfortunate. I\r\nknow all, because I was rich!\"\r\n\r\n\"But the man of whom I speak is not like the others. He is a son who\r\nhas been insulted over the memory of his father, and a young man who,\r\nas he is soon to have a family, thinks of the future, of a happy\r\nfuture for his children.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then he is a man who is going to be happy--our cause is not for\r\nhappy men.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it is for men who have feelings!\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps!\" replied the old man, seating himself. \"Suppose that he\r\nagrees to carry our cry even to the Captain-General, suppose that\r\nhe finds in the Cortes [126] delegates who will plead for us; do you\r\nthink that we shall get justice?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us try it before we resort to violent measure,\" answered\r\nElias. \"You must be surprised that I, another unfortunate, young\r\nand strong, should propose to you, old and weak, peaceful measures,\r\nbut it's because I've seen as much misery caused by us as by the\r\ntyrants. The defenseless are the ones who pay.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if we accomplish nothing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Something we shall accomplish, believe me, for all those who are in\r\npower are not unjust. But if we accomplish nothing, if they disregard\r\nour entreaties, if man has become deaf to the cry of sorrow from his\r\nkind, then I will put myself under your orders!\"\r\n\r\nThe old man embraced the youth enthusiastically. \"I accept your\r\nproposition, Elias. I know that you will keep your word. You will\r\ncome to me, and I shall help you to revenge your ancestors, you will\r\nhelp me to revenge my sons, my sons that were like you!\"\r\n\r\n\"In the meantime, sir, you will refrain from violent measures?\"\r\n\r\n\"You will present the complaints of the people, you know them. When\r\nshall I know your answer?\"\r\n\r\n\"In four days send a man to the beach at San Diego and I will tell\r\nhim what I shall have learned from the person in whom I place so\r\nmuch hope. If he accepts, they will give us justice; and if not,\r\nI'll be the first to fall in the struggle that we will begin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Elias will not die, Elias will be the leader when Capitan Pablo fails,\r\nsatisfied in his revenge,\" concluded the old man, as he accompanied\r\nthe youth out of the cave into the open air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI\r\n\r\nThe Cockpit\r\n\r\n\r\nTo keep holy the afternoon of the Sabbath one generally goes to\r\nthe cockpit in the Philippines, just as to the bull-fights in\r\nSpain. Cockfighting, a passion introduced into the country and\r\nexploited for a century past, is one of the vices of the people, more\r\nwidely spread than opium-smoking among the Chinese. There the poor\r\nman goes to risk all that he has, desirous of getting rich without\r\nwork. There the rich man goes to amuse himself, using the money that\r\nremains to him from his feasts and his masses of thanksgiving. The\r\nfortune that he gambles is his own, the cock is raised with much\r\nmore care perhaps than his son and successor in the cockpit, so we\r\nhave nothing to say against it. Since the government permits it and\r\neven in a way recommends it, by providing that the spectacle may take\r\nplace only in the _public plazas_, on _holidays_ (in order that all\r\nmay see it and be encouraged by the example?), _from the high mass\r\nuntil nightfall (eight_ hours), let us proceed thither to seek out\r\nsome of our acquaintances.\r\n\r\nThe cockpit of San Diego does not differ from those to be found in\r\nother towns, except in some details. It consists of three parts,\r\nthe first of which, the entrance, is a large rectangle some twenty\r\nmeters long by fourteen wide. On one side is the gateway, generally\r\ntended by an old woman whose business it is to collect the _sa pintu_,\r\nor admission fee. Of this contribution, which every one pays, the\r\ngovernment receives a part, amounting to some hundreds of thousands of\r\npesos a year. It is said that with this money, with which vice pays\r\nits license, magnificent schoolhouses are erected, bridges and roads\r\nare constructed, prizes for encouraging agriculture and commerce are\r\ndistributed: blessed be the vice that produces such good results! In\r\nthis first enclosure are the vendors of buyos, cigars, sweetmeats,\r\nand foodstuffs. There swarm the boys in company with their fathers\r\nor uncles, who carefully initiate them into the secrets of life.\r\n\r\nThis enclosure communicates with another of somewhat larger\r\ndimensions,--a kind of foyer where the public gathers while waiting\r\nfor the combats. There are the greater part of the fighting-cocks tied\r\nwith cords which are fastened to the ground by means of a piece of\r\nbone or hard wood; there are assembled the gamblers, the devotees,\r\nthose skilled in tying on the gaffs, there they make agreements,\r\nthey deliberate, they beg for loans, they curse, they swear, they\r\nlaugh boisterously. That one fondles his chicken, rubbing his hand\r\nover its brilliant plumage, this one examines and counts the scales\r\non its legs, they recount the exploits of the champions.\r\n\r\nThere you will see many with mournful faces carrying by the feet\r\ncorpses picked of their feathers; the creature that was the favorite\r\nfor months, petted and cared for day and night, on which were founded\r\nsuch flattering hopes, is now nothing more than a carcass to be\r\nsold for a peseta or to be stewed with ginger and eaten that very\r\nnight. _Sic transit gloria mundi!_ The loser returns to the home\r\nwhere his anxious wife and ragged children await him, without his\r\nmoney or his chicken. Of all that golden dream, of all those vigils\r\nduring months from the dawn of day to the setting of the sun, of all\r\nthose fatigues and labors, there results only a peseta, the ashes\r\nleft from so much smoke.\r\n\r\nIn this foyer even the least intelligent takes part in the discussion,\r\nwhile the man of most hasty judgment conscientiously investigates\r\nthe matter, weighs, examines, extends the wings, feels the muscles of\r\nthe cocks. Some go very well-dressed, surrounded and followed by the\r\npartisans of their champions; others who are dirty and bear the imprint\r\nof vice on their squalid features anxiously follow the movements of\r\nthe rich to note the bets, since the purse may become empty but the\r\npassion never satiated. No countenance here but is animated--not\r\nhere is to be found the indolent, apathetic, silent Filipino--all\r\nis movement, passion, eagerness. It may be, one would say, that they\r\nhave that thirst which is quickened by the water of the swamp.\r\n\r\nFrom this place one passes into the arena, which is known as the\r\n_Rueda_, the wheel. The ground here, surrounded by bamboo-stakes, is\r\nusually higher than that in the two other divisions. In the back part,\r\nreaching almost to the roof, are tiers of seats for the spectators,\r\nor gamblers, since these are the same. During the fights these seats\r\nare filled with men and boys who shout, clamor, sweat, quarrel,\r\nand blaspheme--fortunately, hardly any women get in this far. In the\r\n_Rueda_ are the men of importance, the rich, the famous bettors, the\r\ncontractor, the referee. On the perfectly leveled ground the cocks\r\nfight, and from there Destiny apportions to the families smiles or\r\ntears, feast or famine.\r\n\r\nAt the time of entering we see the gobernadorcillo, Capitan Pablo,\r\nCapitan Basilio, and Lucas, the man with the sear on his face who\r\nfelt so deeply the death of his brother.\r\n\r\nCapitan Basilio approaches one of the townsmen and asks, \"Do you know\r\nwhich cock Capitan Tiago is going to bring?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, sir. This morning two came, one of them the _lásak_\r\nthat whipped the Consul's _talisain_.\" [127]\r\n\r\n\"Do you think that my _bulik_ is a match for it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should say so! I'll bet my house and my camisa on it!\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment Capitan Tiago arrives, dressed like the heavy gamblers,\r\nin a camisa of Canton linen, woolen pantaloons, and a wide straw\r\nhat. Behind him come two servants carrying the _lásak_ and a white\r\ncock of enormous size.\r\n\r\n\"Sinang tells me that Maria is improving all the time,\" says Capitan\r\nBasilio.\r\n\r\n\"She has no more fever but is still very weak.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you lose last night?\"\r\n\r\n\"A little. I hear that you won. I'm going to see if I can't get\r\neven here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you want to fight the _lásak?_\" asks Capitan Basilio, looking at\r\nthe cock and taking it from the servant. \"That depends--if there's\r\na bet.\"\r\n\r\n\"How much will you put up?\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't gamble for less than two.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you seen my _bulik?_\" inquires Capitan Basilio, calling to a\r\nman who is carrying a small game-cock.\r\n\r\nCapitan Tiago examines it and after feeling its weight and studying\r\nits scales returns it with the question, \"How much will you put up?\"\r\n\r\n\"Whatever you will.\"\r\n\r\n\"Two, and five hundred?\"\r\n\r\n\"Three?\"\r\n\r\n\"Three!\"\r\n\r\n\"For the next fight after this!\"\r\n\r\nThe chorus of curious bystanders and the gamblers spread the news\r\nthat two celebrated cocks will fight, each of which has a history\r\nand a well-earned reputation. All wish to see and examine the two\r\ncelebrities, opinions are offered, prophecies are made.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the murmur of the voices grows, the confusion increases,\r\nthe _Rueda_ is broken into, the seats are filled. The skilled\r\nattendants carry the two cocks into the arena, a white and a red,\r\nalready armed but with the gaffs still sheathed. Cries are heard,\r\n\"On the white!\" \"On the white!\" while some other voice answers,\r\n\"On the red!\" The odds are on the white, he is the favorite; the red\r\nis the \"outsider,\" the _dejado_.\r\n\r\nMembers of the Civil Guard move about in the crowd. They are not\r\ndressed in the uniform of that meritorious corps, but neither are\r\nthey in civilian costume. Trousers of _guingón_ with a red stripe,\r\na camisa stained blue from the faded blouse, and a service-cap, make\r\nup their costume, in keeping with their deportment; they make bets\r\nand keep watch, they raise disturbances and talk of keeping the peace.\r\n\r\nWhile the spectators are yelling, waving their hands, flourishing and\r\nclinking pieces of silver; while they search in their pockets for the\r\nlast coin, or, in the lack of such, try to pledge their word, promising\r\nto sell the carabao or the next crop, two boys, brothers apparently,\r\nfollow the bettors with wistful eyes, loiter about, murmur timid words\r\nto which no one listens, become more and more gloomy and gaze at one\r\nanother ill-humoredly and dejectedly. Lucas watches them covertly,\r\nsmiles malignantly, jingles his silver, passes close to them, and\r\ngazing into the _Rueda_, cries out:\r\n\r\n\"Fifty, fifty to twenty on the white!\"\r\n\r\nThe two brothers exchange glances.\r\n\r\n\"I told you,\" muttered the elder, \"that you shouldn't have put up all\r\nthe money. If you had listened to me we should now have something to\r\nbet on the red.\"\r\n\r\nThe younger timidly approached Lucas and touched him on the arm.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's you!\" exclaimed the latter, turning around with feigned\r\nsurprise. \"Does your brother accept my proposition or do you want\r\nto bet?\"\r\n\r\n\"How can we bet when we've lost everything?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you accept?\"\r\n\r\n\"He doesn't want to! If you would lend us something, now that you\r\nsay you know us--\"\r\n\r\nLucas scratched his head, pulled at his camisa, and replied, \"Yes,\r\nI know you. You are Tarsilo and Bruno, both young and strong. I know\r\nthat your brave father died as a result of the hundred lashes a day\r\nthose soldiers gave him. I know that you don't think of revenging him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't meddle in our affairs!\" broke in Tarsilo, the elder. \"That might\r\nlead to trouble. If it were not that we have a sister, we should have\r\nbeen hanged long ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hanged? They only hang a coward, one who has no money or\r\ninfluence. And at all events the mountains are near.\"\r\n\r\n\"A hundred to twenty on the white!\" cried a passer-by.\r\n\r\n\"Lend us four pesos, three, two,\" begged the younger.\r\n\r\n\"We'll soon pay them back double. The fight is going to commence.\"\r\n\r\nLucas again scratched his head. \"Tush! This money isn't mine. Don\r\nCrisostomo has given it to me for those who are willing to serve\r\nhim. But I see that you're not like your father--he was really\r\nbrave--let him who is not so not seek amusement!\" So saying, he drew\r\naway from them a little.\r\n\r\n\"Let's take him up, what's the difference?\" said Bruno. \"It's the same\r\nto be shot as to be hanged. We poor folks are good for nothing else.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're right--but think of our sister!\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the ring has been cleared and the combat is about to\r\nbegin. The voices die away as the two starters, with the expert who\r\nfastens the gaffs, are left alone in the center. At a signal from\r\nthe referee, the expert unsheathes the gaffs and the fine blades\r\nglitter threateningly.\r\n\r\nSadly and silently the two brothers draw nearer to the ring until their\r\nforeheads are pressed against the railing. A man approaches them and\r\ncalls into their ears, \"_Pare_, [128] a hundred to ten on the white!\"\r\n\r\nTarsilo stares at him in a foolish way and responds to Bruno's nudge\r\nwith a grunt.\r\n\r\nThe starters hold the cocks with skilful delicacy, taking care not\r\nto wound themselves. A solemn silence reigns; the spectators seem\r\nto be changed into hideous wax figures. They present one cock to\r\nthe other, holding his head down so that the other may peck at it\r\nand thus irritate him. Then the other is given a like opportunity,\r\nfor in every duel there must be fair play, whether it is a question\r\nof Parisian cocks or Filipino cocks. Afterwards, they hold them up\r\nin sight of each other, close together, so that each of the enraged\r\nlittle creatures may see who it is that has pulled out a feather,\r\nand with whom he must fight. Their neck-feathers bristle up as they\r\ngaze at each other fixedly with flashes of anger darting from their\r\nlittle round eyes. Now the moment has come; the attendants place them\r\non the ground a short distance apart and leave them a clear field.\r\n\r\nSlowly they advance, their footfalls are, audible on the hard\r\nground. No one in the crowd speaks, no one breathes. Raising and\r\nlowering their heads as if to gauge one another with a look, the two\r\ncocks utter sounds of defiance and contempt. Each sees the bright\r\nblade throwing out its cold, bluish reflections. The danger animates\r\nthem and they rush directly toward each other, but a pace apart they\r\ncheck themselves with fixed gaze and bristling plumage. At that moment\r\ntheir little heads are filled with a rush of blood, their anger flashes\r\nforth, and they hurl themselves together with instinctive valor. They\r\nstrike beak to beak, breast to breast, gaff to gaff, wing to wing, but\r\nthe blows are skilfully parried, only a few feathers fall. Again they\r\nsize each other up: suddenly the white rises on his wings, brandishing\r\nthe deadly knife, but the red has bent his legs and lowered his head,\r\nso the white smites only the empty air.. Then on touching the ground\r\nthe white, fearing a blow from behind, turns quickly to face his\r\nadversary. The red attacks him furiously, but he defends himself\r\ncalmly--not undeservedly is he the favorite of the spectators, all\r\nof whom tremulously and anxiously follow the fortunes of the fight,\r\nonly here and there an involuntary cry being heard.\r\n\r\nThe ground becomes strewn with red and white feathers dyed in blood,\r\nbut the contest is not for the first blood; the Filipino, carrying out\r\nthe laws dictated by his government, wishes it to be to the death or\r\nuntil one or the other turns tail and runs. Blood covers the ground,\r\nthe blows are more numerous, but victory still hangs in the balance. At\r\nlast, with a supreme effort, the white throws himself forward for\r\na final stroke, fastens his gaff in the wing of the red and catches\r\nit between the bones. But the white himself has been wounded in the\r\nbreast and both are weak and feeble from loss of blood. Breathless,\r\ntheir strength spent, caught one against the other, they remain\r\nmotionless until the white, with blood pouring from his beak, falls,\r\nkicking his death-throes. The red remains at his side with his wing\r\ncaught, then slowly doubles up his legs and gently closes his eyes.\r\n\r\nThen the referee, in accordance with the rule prescribed by the\r\ngovernment, declares the red the winner. A savage yell greets\r\nthe decision, a yell that is heard over the whole town, even and\r\nprolonged. He who hears this from afar then knows that the winner is\r\nthe one against which the odds were placed, or the joy would not be\r\nso lasting. The same happens with the nations: when a small one gains\r\na victory over a large one, it is sung and recounted from age to age.\r\n\r\n\"You see now!\" said Bruno dejectedly to his brother, \"if you had\r\nlistened to me we should now have a hundred pesos. You're the cause\r\nof our being penniless.\"\r\n\r\nTarsilo did not answer, but gazed about him as if looking for some one.\r\n\r\n\"There he is, talking to Pedro,\" added Bruno. \"He's giving him money,\r\nlots of money!\"\r\n\r\nTrue it was that Lucas was counting silver coins into the hand of\r\nSisa's husband. The two then exchanged some words in secret and\r\nseparated, apparently satisfied.\r\n\r\n\"Pedro must have agreed. That's what it is to be decided,\" sighed\r\nBruno.\r\n\r\nTarsilo remained gloomy and thoughtful, wiping away with the cuff of\r\nhis camisa the perspiration that ran down his forehead.\r\n\r\n\"Brother,\" said Bruno, \"I'm going to accept, if you don't decide. The\r\n_law_ [129] continues, the _lásak_ must win and we ought not\r\nto lose any chance. I want to bet on the next fight. What's the\r\ndifference? We'll revenge our father.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait!\" said Tarsilo, as he gazed at him fixedly, eye to eye, while\r\nboth turned pale. \"I'll go with you, you're right. We'll revenge our\r\nfather.\" Still, he hesitated, and again wiped away the perspiration.\r\n\r\n\"What's stopping you?\" asked Bruno impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know what fight comes next? Is it worth while?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you think that way, no! Haven't you heard? The _bulik_ of Capitan\r\nBasilio's against Capitan Tiago's _lásak_. According to the _law_\r\nthe _lásak_ must win.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, the _lásak_! I'd bet on it, too. But let's be sure first.\"\r\n\r\nBruno made a sign of impatience, but followed his brother, who\r\nexamined the cock, studied it, meditated and reflected, asked some\r\nquestions. The poor fellow was in doubt. Bruno gazed at him with\r\nnervous anger.\r\n\r\n\"But don't you see that wide scale he has by the side of his\r\nspur? Don't you see those feet? What more do you want? Look at those\r\nlegs, spread out his wings! And this split scale above this wide one,\r\nand this double one?\"\r\n\r\nTarsilo did not hear him, but went on examining the cock. The clinking\r\nof gold and silver came to his ears. \"Now let's look at the _bulik_,\"\r\nhe said in a thick voice.\r\n\r\nBruno stamped on the ground and gnashed his teeth, but obeyed. They\r\napproached another group where a cock was being prepared for the\r\nring. A gaff was selected, red silk thread for tying it on was waxed\r\nand rubbed thoroughly. Tarsilo took in the creature with a gloomily\r\nimpressive gaze, as if he were not looking at the bird so much as at\r\nsomething in the future. He rubbed his hand across his forehead and\r\nsaid to his brother in a stifled voice, \"Are you ready?\"\r\n\r\n\"I? Long ago! Without looking at them!\"\r\n\r\n\"But, our poor sister--\"\r\n\r\n\"_Abá!_ Haven't they told you that Don Crisostomo is the leader? Didn't\r\nyou see him walking with the Captain-General? What risk do we run?\"\r\n\r\n\"And if we get killed?\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the difference? Our father was flogged to death!\"\r\n\r\n\"You're right!\"\r\n\r\nThe brothers now sought for Lucas in the different groups. As soon\r\nas they saw him Tarsilo stopped. \"No! Let's get out of here! We're\r\ngoing to ruin ourselves!\" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Go on if you want to! I'm going to accept!\"\r\n\r\n\"Bruno!\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, a man approached them, saying, \"Are you betting? I'm\r\nfor the _bulik!_\" The brothers did not answer.\r\n\r\n\"I'll give odds!\"\r\n\r\n\"How much?\" asked Bruno.\r\n\r\nThe man began to count out his pesos. Bruno watched him breathlessly.\r\n\r\n\"I have two hundred. Fifty to forty!\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Bruno resolutely. \"Put--\"\r\n\r\n\"All right! Fifty to thirty!\"\r\n\r\n\"Double it if you want to.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. The _bulik_ belongs to my protector and I've just won. A\r\nhundred to sixty!\"\r\n\r\n\"Taken! Wait till I get the money.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I'll hold the stakes,\" said the other, not confiding much in\r\nBruno's looks.\r\n\r\n\"It's all the same to me,\" answered the latter, trusting to his\r\nfists. Then turning to his brother he added, \"Even if you do keep out,\r\nI'm going in.\"\r\n\r\nTarsilo reflected: he loved his brother and liked the sport, and,\r\nunable to desert him, he murmured, \"Let it go.\"\r\n\r\nThey made their way to Lucas, who, on seeing them approach, smiled.\r\n\r\n\"Sir!\" called Tarsilo.\r\n\r\n\"What's up?\"\r\n\r\n\"How much will you give us?\" asked the two brothers together.\r\n\r\n\"I've already told you. If you will undertake to get others for the\r\npurpose of making a surprise-attack on the barracks, I'll give each\r\nof you thirty pesos and ten pesos for each companion you bring. If\r\nall goes well, each one will receive a hundred pesos and you double\r\nthat amount. Don Crisostomo is rich.\"\r\n\r\n\"Accepted!\" exclaimed Bruno. \"Let's have the money.\"\r\n\r\n\"I knew you were brave, as your father was! Come, so that those\r\nfellows who killed him may not overhear us,\" said Lucas, indicating\r\nthe civil-guards.\r\n\r\nTaking them into a corner, he explained to them while he was counting\r\nout the money, \"Tomorrow Don Crisostomo will get back with the\r\narms. Day after tomorrow, about eight o'clock at night, go to the\r\ncemetery and I'll let you know the final arrangements. You have time\r\nto look for companions.\"\r\n\r\nAfter they had left him the two brothers seemed to have changed\r\nparts--Tarsilo was calm, while Bruno was uneasy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII\r\n\r\nThe Two Señoras\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Capitan Tiago was gambling on his _lásak_, Doña Victorina was\r\ntaking a walk through the town for the purpose of observing how the\r\nindolent Indians kept their houses and fields. She was dressed as\r\nelegantly as possible with all her ribbons and flowers over her silk\r\ngown, in order to impress the provincials and make them realize what a\r\ndistance intervened between them and her sacred person. Giving her arm\r\nto her lame husband, she strutted along the streets amid the wonder\r\nand stupefaction of the natives. Her cousin Linares had remained in\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\n\"What ugly shacks these Indians have!\" she began with a grimace. \"I\r\ndon't see how they can live in them--one must have to be an Indian! And\r\nhow rude they are and how proud! They don't take off their hats when\r\nthey meet us! Hit them over the head as the curates and the officers\r\nof the Civil Guard do--teach them politeness!\"\r\n\r\n\"And if they hit me back?\" asked Dr. De Espadaña.\r\n\r\n\"That's what you're a man for!\"\r\n\r\n\"B-but, I'm l-lame!\"\r\n\r\nDoña Victorina was falling into a bad humor. The streets were unpaved\r\nand the train of her gown was covered with dust. Besides, they had met\r\na number of young women, who, in passing them, had dropped their eyes\r\nand had not admired her rich costume as they should have done. Sinang's\r\ncochero, who was driving Sinang and her cousin in an elegant carriage,\r\nhad the impudence to yell \"_Tabi!_\" in such a commanding tone that\r\nshe had to jump out of the way, and could only protest: \"Look at\r\nthat brute of a cochero! I'm going to tell his master to train his\r\nservants better.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's go back to the house,\" she commanded to her husband, who,\r\nfearing a storm, wheeled on his crutch in obedience to her mandate.\r\n\r\nThey met and exchanged greetings with the alferez. This increased\r\nDoña Victorina's ill humor, for the officer not only did not proffer\r\nany compliment on her costume, but even seemed to stare at it in a\r\nmocking way.\r\n\r\n\"You ought not to shake hands with a mere alferez,\" she said to her\r\nhusband as the soldier left them. \"He scarcely touched his helmet\r\nwhile you took off your hat. You don't know how to maintain your rank!\"\r\n\r\n\"He's the b-boss here!\"\r\n\r\n\"What do we care for that? We are Indians, perhaps?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're right,\" he assented, not caring to quarrel. They passed in\r\nfront of the officer's dwelling. Doña Consolacion was at the window,\r\nas usual, dressed in flannel and smoking her cigar. As the house was\r\nlow, the two señoras measured one another with looks; Doña Victorina\r\nstared while the Muse of the Civil Guard examined her from head to\r\nfoot, and then, sticking out her lower lip, turned her head away\r\nand spat on the ground. This used up the last of Doña Victorina's\r\npatience. Leaving her husband without support, she planted herself\r\nin front of the alfereza, trembling with anger from head to foot and\r\nunable to speak. Doña Consolacion slowly turned her head, calmly looked\r\nher over again, and once more spat, this time with greater disdain.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter with you, Doña?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Can you tell me, señora, why you look at me so? Are you envious?\" Doña\r\nVictorina was at length able to articulate.\r\n\r\n\"I, envious of you, I, of you?\" drawled the Muse. \"Yes, I envy you\r\nthose frizzes!\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, woman!\" pleaded the doctor. \"D-don't t-take any n-notice!\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me teach this shameless slattern a lesson,\" replied his wife,\r\ngiving him such a shove that he nearly kissed the ground. Then she\r\nagain turned to Doña Consolacion.\r\n\r\n\"Remember who you're dealing with!\" she exclaimed. \"Don't think that\r\nI'm a provincial or a soldier's _querida!_ In my house in Manila the\r\nalfereces don't eater, they wait at the door.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oho, _Excelentísima Señora!_ Alfereces don't enter, but cripples\r\ndo--like that one--ha, ha, ha!\"\r\n\r\nHad it not been for the rouge, Doña Victorian would have been seen to\r\nblush. She tried to get to her antagonist, but the sentinel stopped\r\nher. In the meantime the street was filling up with a curious crowd.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, I lower myself talking to you--people of quality--Don't you\r\nwant to wash my clothes? I'll pay you well! Do you think that I don't\r\nknow that you were a washerwoman_?_\"\r\n\r\nDoña Consolacion straightened up furiously; the remark about washing\r\nhurt her. \"Do you think that we don't know who you are and what\r\nclass of people you belong with? Get out, my husband has already\r\ntold me! Señora, I at least have never belonged to more than one,\r\nbut you? One must be dying of hunger to take the leavings, the mop\r\nof the whole world!\"\r\n\r\nThis shot found its mark with Doña Victorina. She rolled up her\r\nsleeves, clenched her fists, and gritted her teeth. \"Come down,\r\nold sow!\" she cried. \"I'm going to smash that dirty mouth of\r\nyours! _Querida_ of a battalion, filthy hag!\"\r\n\r\nThe Muse immediately disappeared from the window and was soon seen\r\nrunning down the stairs flourishing her husband's whip.\r\n\r\nDon Tiburcio interposed himself supplicatingly, but they would have\r\ncome to blows had not the alferez arrived on the scene.\r\n\r\n\"Ladies! Don Tiburcio!\"\r\n\r\n\"Train your woman better, buy her some decent clothes, and if you\r\nhaven't any money left, rob the people--that's what you've got soldiers\r\nfor!\" yelled Doña Victorina.\r\n\r\n\"Here I am, señora! Why doesn't your Excellency smash my mouth? You're\r\nonly tongue and spittle, Doña Excelencia!\"\r\n\r\n\"Señora!\" cried the alferez furiously to Doña Victorina, \"be\r\nthankful that I remember that you're a woman or else I'd kick you to\r\npieces--frizzes, ribbons, and all!\"\r\n\r\n\"S-señor Alferez!\"\r\n\r\n\"Get out, you quack! You don't wear the pants!\"\r\n\r\nThe women brought into play words and gestures, insults and abuse,\r\ndragging out all the evil that was stored in the recesses of their\r\nminds. Since all four talked at once and said so many things that\r\nmight hurt the prestige of certain classes by the truths that were\r\nbrought to light, we forbear from recording what they said. The curious\r\nspectators, while they may not have understood all that was said,\r\ngot not a little entertainment out of the scene and hoped that the\r\naffair would come to blows. Unfortunately for them, the curate came\r\nalong and restored order.\r\n\r\n\"Señores! Señoras! What a shame! Señor Alferez!\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing here, you hypocrite, Carlist!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don Tiburcio, take your wife away! Señora, hold your tongue!\"\r\n\r\n\"Say that to these robbers of the poor!\"\r\n\r\nLittle by little the lexicon of epithets was exhausted, the review\r\nof shamelessness of the two couples completed, and with threats and\r\ninsults they gradually drew away from one another. Fray Salvi moved\r\nfrom one group to the other, giving animation to the scene. Would\r\nthat our friend the correspondent had been present!\r\n\r\n\"This very day we'll go to Manila and see the\r\nCaptain-General!\" declared the raging Doña Victorina to her\r\nhusband. \"You're not a man! It's a waste of money to buy trousers\r\nfor you!\"\r\n\r\n\"B-but, woman, the g-guards? I'm l-lame!\"\r\n\r\n\"You must challenge him for pistol or sword, or--or--\" Doña Victorina\r\nstared fixedly at his false teeth.\r\n\r\n\"My d-dear, I've never had hold of a--\"\r\n\r\nBut she did not let him finish. With a majestic sweep of her hand\r\nshe snatched out his false teeth and trampled them in the street.\r\n\r\nThus, he half-crying and she breathing fire, they reached the\r\nhouse. Linares was talking with Maria Clara, Sinang, and Victoria, and\r\nas he had heard nothing of the quarrel, became rather uneasy at sight\r\nof his cousins. Maria Clara, lying in an easy-chair among pillows and\r\nwraps, was greatly surprised to see the new physiognomy of her doctor.\r\n\r\n\"Cousin,\" began Doña Victorina, \"you must challenge the alferez right\r\naway, or--\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" asked the startled Linares.\r\n\r\n\"You challenge him right now or else I'll tell everybody here who\r\nyou are.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Doña Victorina!\"\r\n\r\nThe three girls exchanged glances.\r\n\r\n\"You'll see! The alferez has insulted us and said that you are what\r\nyou are! His old hag came down with a whip and he, this thing here,\r\npermitted the insult--a man!\"\r\n\r\n\"_Abá!_\" exclaimed Sinang, \"they're had a fight and we didn't see it!\"\r\n\r\n\"The alferez smashed the doctor's teeth,\" observed Victoria.\r\n\r\n\"This very day we go to Manila. You, you stay here to challenge him\r\nor else I'll tell Don Santiago that all we're told him is a lie,\r\nI'll tell him--\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Doña Victorina, Doña Victorina,\" interrupted the now pallid\r\nLinares, going up to her, \"be calm, don't call up--\" Then he added\r\nin a whisper, \"Don't be imprudent, especially just now.\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment Capitan Tiago came in from the cockpit, sad and\r\nsighing; he had lost his _lásak_. But Doña Victorina left him no\r\ntime to grieve. In a few words but with no lack of strong language\r\nshe related what had happened, trying of course to put herself in\r\nthe best light possible.\r\n\r\n\"Linares is going to challenge him, do you hear? If he doesn't, don't\r\nlet him marry your daughter, don't you permit it! If he hasn't any\r\ncourage, he doesn't deserve Clarita!\"\r\n\r\n\"So you're going to marry this gentleman?\" asked Sinang, but her\r\nmerry eyes filled with tears. \"I knew that you were prudent but not\r\nthat you were fickle.\"\r\n\r\nPale as wax, Maria Clara partly rose and stared with frightened eyes\r\nat her father, at Doña Victorina, at Linares. The latter blushed,\r\nCapitan Tiago dropped his eyes, while the señora went on:\r\n\r\n\"Clarita, bear this in mind: never marry a man that doesn't wear\r\ntrousers. You expose yourself to insults, even from the dogs!\"\r\n\r\nThe girl did not answer her, but turned to her friends and said,\r\n\"Help me to my room, I can't walk alone.\"\r\n\r\nBy their aid she rose, and with her waist encircled by the round arms\r\nof her friends, resting her marble-like head on the shoulder of the\r\nbeautiful Victoria, she went to her chamber.\r\n\r\nThat same night the married couple gathered their effects together\r\nand presented Capitan Tiago with a bill which amounted to several\r\nthousand pesos. Very early the following day they left for Manila in\r\nhis carriage, committing to the bashful Linares the office of avenger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII\r\n\r\nThe Enigma\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tVolverán las oscuras golondrinas. [130]\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBECQUER.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Lucas had foretold, Ibarra arrived on the following day. His first\r\nvisit was to the family of Capitan Tiago for the purpose of seeing\r\nMaria Clara and informing her that his Grace had reconciled him with\r\nreligion, and that he brought to the curate a letter of recommendation\r\nin the handwriting of the Archbishop himself. Aunt Isabel was not\r\na little rejoiced at this, for she liked the young man and did not\r\nlook favorably on the marriage of her niece with Linares. Capitan\r\nTiago was not at home.\r\n\r\n\"Come in,\" said the aunt in her broken Spanish. \"Maria, Don Crisostomo\r\nis once more in the favor of God. The Archbishop has _discommunicated_\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nBut the youth was unable to advance, the smile froze on his lips,\r\nwords failed him. Standing on the balcony at the side of Maria Clara\r\nwas Linares, arranging bouquets of flowers and leaves. Roses and\r\nsampaguitas were scattered about on the floor. Reclining in a big\r\nchair, pale, with a sad and pensive air, Maria Clara toyed with an\r\nivory fan which was not whiter than her shapely fingers.\r\n\r\nAt the appearance of Ibarra, Linares turned pale and Maria Clara's\r\ncheeks flushed crimson. She tried to rise, but strength failed her,\r\nso she dropped her eyes and let the fan fall. An embarrassed silence\r\nprevailed for a few moments. Ibarra was then able to move forward and\r\nmurmur tremblingly, \"I've just got back and have come immediately to\r\nsee you. I find you better than I had thought I should.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl seemed to have been stricken dumb; she neither said anything\r\nnor raised her eyes.\r\n\r\nIbarra looked Linares over from head to foot with a stare which the\r\nbashful youth bore haughtily.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I see that my arrival was unexpected,\" said Ibarra\r\nslowly. \"Maria, pardon me that I didn't have myself announced. At\r\nsome other time I'll be able to make explanations to you about my\r\nconduct. We'll still see one another surely.\"\r\n\r\nThese last words were accompanied by a look at Linares. The girl\r\nraised toward him her lovely eyes, full of purity and sadness. They\r\nwere so beseeching and eloquent that Ibarra stopped in confusion.\r\n\r\n\"May I come tomorrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know that for my part you are always welcome,\" she answered\r\nfaintly.\r\n\r\nIbarra withdrew in apparent calm, but with a tempest in his head and\r\nice in his heart. What he had just seen and felt was incomprehensible\r\nto him: was it doubt, dislike, or faithlessness?\r\n\r\n\"Oh, only a woman after all!\" he murmured.\r\n\r\nTaking no note of where he was going, he reached the spot where the\r\nschoolhouse was under construction. The work was well advanced, Ñor\r\nJuan with his mile and plumb-bob coming and going among the numerous\r\nlaborers. Upon catching sight of Ibarra he ran to meet him.\r\n\r\n\"Don Crisostomo, at last you've come! We've all been waiting for\r\nyou. Look at the walls, they're already more than a meter high and\r\nwithin two days they'll be up to the height of a man. I've put in\r\nonly the strongest and most durable woods--molave, dungon, ipil,\r\nlangil--and sent for the finest--tindalo, malatapay, pino, and\r\nnarra--for the finishings. Do you want to look at the foundations?\"\r\n\r\nThe workmen saluted Ibarra respectfully, while Ñor Juan made voluble\r\nexplanations. \"Here is the piping that I have taken the liberty\r\nto add,\" he said. \"These subterranean conduits lead to a sort of\r\ncesspool, thirty yards away. It will help fertilize the garden. There\r\nwas nothing of that in the plan. Does it displease you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite the contrary, I approve what you've done and congratulate\r\nyou. You are a real architect. From whom did you learn the business?\"\r\n\r\n\"From myself, sir,\" replied the old man modestly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, before I forget about it--tell those who may have scruples,\r\nif perhaps there is any one who fears to speak to me, that I'm no\r\nlonger excommunicated. The Archbishop invited me to dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Abá_, sir, we don't pay any attention to excommunications! All of\r\nus are excommunicated. Padre Damaso himself is and yet he stays fat.\"\r\n\r\n\"How's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's true, sir, for a year ago he caned the coadjutor, who is\r\njust as much a sacred person as he is. Who pays any attention to\r\nexcommunications, sir?\"\r\n\r\nAmong the laborers Ibarra caught sight of Elias, who, as he saluted\r\nhim along with the others, gave him to understand by a look that he\r\nhad something to say to him.\r\n\r\n\"Ñor Juan,\" said Ibarra, \"will you bring me your list of the laborers?\"\r\n\r\nÑor Juan disappeared, and Ibarra approached Elias, who was by himself,\r\nlifting a heavy stone into a cart.\r\n\r\n\"If you can grant me a few hours' conversation, sir, walk down to\r\nthe shore of the lake this evening and get into my banka.\" The youth\r\nnodded, and Elias moved away.\r\n\r\nÑor Juan now brought the list, but Ibarra scanned it in vain; the\r\nname of Elias did not appear on it!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX\r\n\r\nThe Voice of the Hunted\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the sun was sinking below the horizon Ibarra stepped into Elias's\r\nbanka at the shore of the lake. The youth looked out of humor.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, sir,\" said Elias sadly, on seeing him, \"that I have been\r\nso bold as to make this appointment. I wanted to talk to you freely\r\nand so I chose this means, for here we won't have any listeners. We\r\ncan return within an hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're wrong, friend,\" answered Ibarra with a forced smile. \"You'll\r\nhave to take me to that town whose belfry we see from here. A mischance\r\nforces me to this.\"\r\n\r\n\"A mischance?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. On my way here I met the alferez and he forced his company on\r\nme. I thought of you and remembered that he knows you, so to get away\r\nfrom him I told him that I was going to that town. I'll have to stay\r\nthere all day, since he will look for me tomorrow afternoon.\"\r\n\r\n\"I appreciate your thoughtfulness, but you might simply have invited\r\nhim to accompany you,\" answered Elias naturally.\r\n\r\n\"What about you?\"\r\n\r\n\"He wouldn't have recognized me, since the only time he ever saw me\r\nhe wasn't in a position to take careful note of my appearance.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm in bad luck,\" sighed Ibarra, thinking of Maria Clara. \"What did\r\nyou have to tell me?\"\r\n\r\nElias looked about him. They were already at a distance from the\r\nshore, the sun had set, and as in these latitudes there is scarcely\r\nany twilight, the shades were lengthening, bringing into view the\r\nbright disk of the full moon.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" replied Elias gravely, \"I am the bearer of the wishes of many\r\nunfortunates.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unfortunates? What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\nIn a few words Elias recounted his conversation with the leader of the\r\ntulisanes, omitting the latter's doubts and threats. Ibarra listened\r\nattentively and was the first to break the long silence that reigned\r\nafter he had finished his story.\r\n\r\n\"So they want--\"\r\n\r\n\"Radical reforms in the armed forces, in the priesthood, and in the\r\nadministration of justice; that is to say, they ask for paternal\r\ntreatment from the government.\"\r\n\r\n\"Reforms? In what sense?\"\r\n\r\n\"For example, more respect for a man's dignity, more security for the\r\nindividual, less force in the armed forces, fewer privileges for that\r\ncorps which so easily abuses what it has.\"\r\n\r\n\"Elias,\" answered the youth, \"I don't know who you are, but I\r\nsuspect that you are not a man of the people; you think and act so\r\ndifferently from others. You will understand me if I tell you that,\r\nhowever imperfect the condition of affairs may be now, it would be\r\nmore so if it were changed. I might be able to get the friends that\r\nI have in Madrid to talk, _by paying them_; I might even be able to\r\nsee the Captain-General; but neither would the former accomplish\r\nanything nor has the latter sufficient power to introduce so many\r\nnovelties. Nor would I ever take a single step in that direction,\r\nfor the reason that, while I fully understand that it is true that\r\nthese corporations have their faults, they are necessary at this\r\ntime. They are what is known as a necessary evil.\"\r\n\r\nGreatly surprised, Elias raised his head and looked at him in\r\nastonishment. \"Do you, then, also believe in a necessary evil,\r\nsir?\" he asked in a voice that trembled slightly. \"Do you believe\r\nthat in order to do good it is necessary to do evil?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I believe in it as in a violent remedy that we make use of when we\r\nwish to cure a disease. Now then, the country is an organism suffering\r\nfrom a chronic malady, and in order to cure it, the government sees\r\nthe necessity of employing such means, harsh and violent if you wish,\r\nbut useful and necessary.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is a bad doctor, sir, who seeks only to destroy or stifle the\r\nsymptoms without an effort to examine into the origin of the malady,\r\nor, when knowing it, fears to attack it. The Civil Guard has only\r\nthis purpose: the repression of crime by means of terror and force, a\r\npurpose that it does not fulfil or accomplishes only incidentally. You\r\nmust take into account the truth that society can be severe with\r\nindividuals only when it has provided them with the means necessary\r\nfor their moral perfection. In our country, where there is no society,\r\nsince there is no unity between the people and the government, the\r\nlatter should be indulgent, not only because indulgence is necessary\r\nbut also because the individual, abandoned and uncared for by it,\r\nhas less responsibility, for the very reason that he has received less\r\nguidance. Besides, following out your comparison, the treatment that\r\nis applied to the ills of the country is so destructive that it is\r\nfelt only in the sound parts of the organism, whose vitality is thus\r\nweakened and made receptive of evil. Would it not be more rational to\r\nstrengthen the diseased parts of the organism and lessen the violence\r\nof the remedy a little?\"\r\n\r\n\"To weaken the Civil Guard would be to endanger the security of\r\nthe towns.\"\r\n\r\n\"The security of the towns!\" exclaimed Elias bitterly. \"It will\r\nsoon be fifteen years since the towns have had their Civil Guard,\r\nand look: still we have tulisanes, still we hear that they sack\r\ntowns, that they infest the highways. Robberies continue and the\r\nperpetrators are not hunted down; crime flourishes, and the real\r\ncriminal goes scot-free, but not so the peaceful inhabitant of the\r\ntown. Ask any honorable citizen if he looks upon this institution as\r\na benefit, a protection on the part of the government, and not as an\r\nimposition, a despotism whose outrageous acts do more damage than\r\nthe violent deeds of criminals. These latter are indeed serious,\r\nbut they are rare, and against them one has the right to defend\r\nhimself, but against the molestations of legal force he is not even\r\nallowed a protest, and if they are not serious they are nevertheless\r\ncontinued and sanctioned. What effect does this institution produce\r\namong our people? It paralyzes communication because all are afraid\r\nof being abused on trifling pretexts. It pays more attention to\r\nformalities than to the real nature of things, which is the first\r\nsymptom of incapacity. Because one has forgotten his cedula he must\r\nbe manacled and knocked about, regardless of the fact that he may be\r\na decent and respectable citizen. The superiors hold it their first\r\nduty to make people salute them, either willingly or forcibly, even\r\nin the darkness of the night, and their inferiors imitate them by\r\nmistreating and robbing the country folk, nor are pretexts lacking\r\nto this end. Sanctity of the home does not exist; not long ago in\r\nKalamba they entered, by forcing their way through the windows, the\r\nhouse of a peaceful inhabitant to whom their chief owed money and\r\nfavors. There is no personal security; when they need to have their\r\nbarracks or houses cleaned they go out and arrest any one who does not\r\nresist them, in order to make him work the whole day. Do you care to\r\nhear more? During these holidays gambling, which is prohibited by law,\r\nhas gone on while they forcibly broke up the celebrations permitted by\r\nthe authorities. You saw what the people thought about these things;\r\nwhat have they got by repressing their anger and hoping for human\r\njustice? Ah, sir, if that is what you call keeping the peace--\"\r\n\r\n\"I agree with you that there are evils,\" replied Ibarra, \"but let\r\nus bear with those evils on account of the benefits that accompany\r\nthem. This institution may be imperfect, but, believe me, by the fear\r\nthat it inspires it keeps the number of criminals from increasing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Say rather that by this fear the number is increased,\" corrected\r\nElias. \"Before the creation of this corps almost all the evil-doers,\r\nwith the exception of a very few, were criminals from hunger. They\r\nplundered and robbed in order to live, but when their time of want\r\nwas passed, they again left the highways clear. Sufficient to put\r\nthem to flight were the poor, but brave cuadrilleros, they who have\r\nbeen so calumniated by the writers about our country, who have for a\r\nright, death, for duty, fighting, and for reward, jests. Now there are\r\ntulisanes who are such for life. A single fault, a crime inhumanly\r\npunished, resistance against the outrages of this power, fear of\r\natrocious tortures, east them out forever from society and condemn\r\nthem to slay or be slain. The terrorism of the Civil Guard closes\r\nagainst them the doors of repentance, and as outlaws they fight to\r\ndefend themselves in the mountains better than the soldiers at whom\r\nthey laugh. The result is that we are unable to put an end to the evil\r\nthat we have created. Remember what the prudence of the Captain-General\r\nde la Torre [131] accomplished. The amnesty granted by him to those\r\nunhappy people has proved that in those mountains there still beat the\r\nhearts of men and that they only wait for pardon. Terrorism is useful\r\nwhen the people are slaves, when the mountains afford no hiding-places,\r\nwhen power places a sentinel behind every tree, and when the body of\r\nthe slave contains nothing more than a stomach and intestines. But\r\nwhen in desperation he fights for his life, feeling his arm strong,\r\nhis heart throb, his whole being fill with hate, how can terrorism\r\nhope to extinguish the flame to which it is only adding fuel?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am perplexed, Elias, to hear you talk thus, and I should almost\r\nbelieve that you were right had I not my own convictions. But note this\r\nfact--and don't be offended, for I consider you an exception--look\r\nwho the men are that ask for these reforms\" nearly all criminals or\r\non the way to be such!\"\r\n\r\n\"Criminals now, or future criminals; but why are they such? Because\r\ntheir peace has been disturbed, their happiness destroyed, their\r\ndearest affections wounded, and when they have asked justice for\r\nprotection, they have become convinced that they can expect it only\r\nfrom themselves. But you are mistaken, sir, if you think that only the\r\ncriminals ask for justice. Go from town to town, from house to house,\r\nlisten to the secret sighings in the bosoms of the families, and you\r\nwill be convinced that the evils which the Civil Guard corrects are\r\nthe same as, if not less than, those it causes all the time. Should\r\nwe decide from this that all the people are criminals? If so, then\r\nwhy defend some from the others, why not destroy them all?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some error exists here which I do not see just now some fallacy in the\r\ntheory to invalidate the practise, for in Spain, the mother country,\r\nthis corps is displaying, and has ever displayed, great usefulness.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't doubt it. Perhaps there, it is better organized, the men\r\nof better grade, perhaps also Spain needs it while the Philippines\r\ndoes not. Our customs, our mode of life, which are always invoked\r\nwhen there is a desire to deny us some right, are entirely overlooked\r\nwhen the desire is to impose something upon us. And tell me, sir, why\r\nhave not the other nations, which from their nearness to Spain must be\r\nmore like her than the Philippines is, adopted this institution? Is it\r\nbecause of this that they still have fewer robberies on their railway\r\ntrains, fewer riots, fewer murders, and fewer assassinations in their\r\ngreat capitals?\"\r\n\r\nIbarra bowed his head in deep thought, raising it after a few\r\nmoments to reply: \"This question, my friend, calls for serious\r\nstudy. If my inquiries convince me that these complaints are well\r\nfounded I will write to my friends in Madrid, since we have no\r\nrepresentatives. Meanwhile, believe me that the government needs a\r\ncorps with strength enough to make itself respected and to enforce\r\nits authority.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, when the government is at war with the country. But for\r\nthe welfare of the government itself we must not have the people think\r\nthat they are in opposition to authority. Rather, if such were true,\r\nif we prefer force to prestige, we ought to take care to whom we grant\r\nthis unlimited power, this authority. So much power in the hands\r\nof men, ignorant men filled with passions, without moral training,\r\nof untried principles, is a weapon in the hands of a madman in a\r\ndefenseless multitude. I concede and wish to believe with you that\r\nthe government needs this weapon, but then let it choose this weapon\r\ncarefully, let it select the most worthy instruments, and since it\r\nprefers to take upon itself authority, rather than have the people\r\ngrant it, at least let it be seen that it knows how to exercise it.\"\r\n\r\nElias spoke passionately, enthusiastically, in vibrating tones; his\r\neyes flashed. A solemn pause followed. The banka, unimpelled by the\r\npaddle, seemed to stand still on the water. The moon shone majestically\r\nin a sapphire sky and a few lights glimmered on the distant shore.\r\n\r\n\"What more do they ask for?\" inquired Ibarra.\r\n\r\n\"Reform in the priesthood,\" answered Elias in a sad and discouraged\r\ntone. \"These unfortunates ask for more protection against--\"\r\n\r\n\"Against the religious orders?\"\r\n\r\n\"Against their oppressors, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has the Philippines forgotten what she owes to those orders? Has she\r\nforgotten the immense debt of gratitude that is due from her to those\r\nwho snatched her from error to give her the true faith, to those who\r\nhave protected her against the tyrannical acts of the civil power? This\r\nis the evil result of not knowing the history of our native land!\"\r\n\r\nThe surprised Elias could hardly credit what he heard. \"Sir,\" he\r\nreplied in a grave tone, \"you accuse these people of ingratitude;\r\nlet me, one of the people who suffer, defend them. Favors rendered,\r\nin order to have any claims to recognition, must be disinterested. Let\r\nus pass over its missionary work, the much-invoked Christian charity;\r\nlet us brush history aside and not ask what Spain has done with the\r\nJewish people, who gave all Europe a Book, a Religion, and a God;\r\nwhat she has done with the Arabic people, who gave her culture,\r\nwho were tolerant with her religious beliefs, and who awoke her\r\nlethargic national spirit, so nearly destroyed during the Roman and\r\nGothic dominations. You say that she snatched us from error and gave\r\nus the true faith: do you call faith these outward forms, do you\r\ncall religion this traffic in girdles and scapularies, truth these\r\nmiracles and wonderful tales that we hear daily? Is this the law of\r\nJesus Christ? For this it was hardly necessary that a God should allow\r\nHimself to be crucified or that we should be obliged to show eternal\r\ngratitude. Superstition existed long before--it was only necessary\r\nto systematize it and raise the price of its merchandise!\r\n\r\n\"You will tell me that however imperfect our religion may be at\r\npresent, it is preferable to what we had before. I believe that, too,\r\nand would agree with you in saying so, but the cost is too great,\r\nsince for it we have given up our nationality, our independence. For\r\nit we have given over to its priests our best towns, our fields, and\r\nstill give up our savings by the purchase of religious objects. An\r\narticle of foreign manufacture has been introduced among us, we have\r\npaid well for it, and we are even.\r\n\r\n\"If you mean the protection that they afforded us against the\r\n_encomenderos_, [132] I might answer that through them we fell under\r\nthe power of the _encomenderos_. But no, I realize that a true faith\r\nand a sincere love for humanity guided the first missionaries to our\r\nshores; I realize the debt of gratitude we owe to those noble hearts;\r\nI know that at that time Spain abounded in heroes of all kinds, in\r\nreligious as well as in political affairs, in civil and in military\r\nlife. But because the forefathers were virtuous, should we consent\r\nto the abuses of their degenerate descendants? Because they have\r\nrendered us great service, should we be to blame for preventing them\r\nfrom doing us wrong? The country does not ask for their expulsion but\r\nonly for reforms required by the changed circumstances and new needs.\"\r\n\r\n\"I love our native land as well as you can, Elias; I understand\r\nsomething of what it desires, and I have listened with attention to\r\nall you have said. But, after all, my friend, I believe that we are\r\nlooking at things through rather impassioned eyes. Here, less than\r\nin other parts, do I see the necessity for reforms.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it possible, sir,\" asked Elias, extending his arms in a gesture\r\nof despair, \"that you do not see the necessity for reforms, you,\r\nafter the misfortunes of your family?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, I forget myself and my own troubles in the presence of the\r\nsecurity of the Philippines, in the presence of the interests of\r\nSpain!\" interrupted Ibarra warmly. \"To preserve the Philippines it\r\nis meet that the friars continue as they are. On the union with Spain\r\ndepends the welfare of our country.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Ibarra had ceased Elias still sat in an attitude of attention\r\nwith a sad countenance and eyes that had lost their luster. \"The\r\nmissionaries conquered the country, it is true,\" he replied, \"but do\r\nyou believe that by the friars the Philippines will be preserved?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, by them alone. Such is the belief of all who have written about\r\nthe country.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed Elias dejectedly, throwing the paddle clown in the\r\nbanka, \"I did not believe that you would have so poor an idea of\r\nthe government and of the country. Why don't you condemn both? What\r\nwould you say of the members of a family that dwells in peace only\r\nthrough the intervention of an outsider: a country that is obedient\r\nbecause it is deceived; a government that commands be, cause it avails\r\nitself of fraud, a government that does not know how to make itself\r\nloved or respected for its own sake? Pardon me, sir, but I believe\r\nthat our government is stupid and is working its own ruin when it\r\nrejoices that such is the belief. I thank you for your kindness,\r\nwhere do you wish me to take you now?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Ibarra, \"let us talk; it is necessary to see who is\r\nright on such an important subject.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, sir,\" replied Elias, shaking his head, \"but I haven't the\r\neloquence to convince you. Even though I have had some education I am\r\nstill an Indian, my way of life seems to you a precarious one, and my\r\nwords will always seem to you suspicious. Those who have given voice\r\nto the opposite opinion are Spaniards, and as such, even though they\r\nmay speak idly and foolishly, their tones, their titles, and their\r\norigin make their words sacred and give them such authority that I\r\nhave desisted forever from arguing against them. Moreover, when I\r\nsee that you, who love your country, you, whose father sleeps beneath\r\nthese quiet waters, you, who have seen yourself attacked, insulted,\r\nand persecuted, hold such opinions in spite of all these things, and\r\nin spite of your knowledge, I begin to doubt my own convictions and\r\nto admit the possibility that the people may be mistaken. I'll have\r\nto tell those unfortunates who have put their trust in men that they\r\nmust place it in God and their own strength. Again I thank you--tell\r\nme where I shall take you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Elias, your bitter words touch my heart and make me also doubt. What\r\ndo you want? I was not brought up among the people, so I am perhaps\r\nignorant of their needs. I spent my childhood in the Jesuit college,\r\nI grew up in Europe, I have been molded by books, learning only what\r\nmen have been able to bring to light. What remains among the shadows,\r\nwhat the writers do not tell, that I am ignorant of. Yet I love our\r\ncountry as you do, not only because it is the duty of every man to\r\nlove the country to which he owes his existence and to which he will\r\nno doubt owe his final rest, not only because my father so taught\r\nme, but also because my mother was an Indian, because my fondest\r\nrecollections cluster around my country, and I love it also because\r\nto it I owe and shall ever owe my happiness!\"\r\n\r\n\"And I, because to it I owe my misfortunes,\" muttered Elias.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my friend, I know that you suffer, that you are unfortunate,\r\nand that those facts make you look into the future darkly and\r\ninfluence your way of thinking, so I am somewhat forearmed against\r\nyour complaints. If I could understand your motives, something of\r\nyour past--\"\r\n\r\n\"My misfortunes had another source. If I thought that the story of\r\nthem would be of any use, I would relate it to you, since, apart from\r\nthe fact that I make no secret of it, it is quite well known to many.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps on hearing it I might correct my opinions. You know that I do\r\nnot trust much to theories, preferring rather to be guided by facts.\"\r\n\r\nElias remained thoughtful for a few moments. \"If that is the case,\r\nsir, I will tell you my story briefly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L\r\n\r\nElias's Story\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Some sixty years ago my grandfather dwelt in Manila, being employed\r\nas a bookkeeper in a Spanish commercial house. He was then very young,\r\nwas married, and had a son. One night from some unknown cause the\r\nwarehouse burned down. The fire was communicated to the dwelling of his\r\nemployer and from there to many other buildings. The losses were great,\r\na scapegoat was sought, and the merchant accused my grandfather. In\r\nvain he protested his innocence, but he was poor and unable to pay the\r\ngreat lawyers, so he was condemned to be flogged publicly and paraded\r\nthrough the streets of Manila. Not so very long since they still used\r\nthe infamous method of punishment which the people call the '_caballo\r\ny vaca_,' [133] and which is a thousand times more dreadful than death\r\nitself. Abandoned by all except his young wife, my grandfather saw\r\nhimself tied to a horse, followed by an unfeeling crowd, and whipped\r\non every street-corner in the sight of men, his brothers, and in the\r\nneighborhood of numerous temples of a God of peace. When the wretch,\r\nnow forever disgraced, had satisfied the vengeance of man with his\r\nblood, his tortures, and his cries, he had to be taken off the horse,\r\nfor he had become unconscious. Would to God that he had died! But\r\nby one of those refinements of cruelty he was given his liberty. His\r\nwife, pregnant at the time, vainly begged from door to door for work or\r\nalms in order to care for her sick husband and their poor son, but who\r\nwould trust the wife of an incendiary and a disgraced man? The wife,\r\nthen, had to become a prostitute!\"\r\n\r\nIbarra rose in his seat.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't get excited! Prostitution was not now a dishonor for her\r\nor a disgrace to her husband; for them honor and shame no longer\r\nexisted. The husband recovered from his wounds and came with his wife\r\nand child to hide himself in the mountains of this province. Here they\r\nlived several months, miserable, alone, hated and shunned by all. The\r\nwife gave birth to a sickly child, which fortunately died. Unable\r\nto endure such misery and being less courageous than his wife, my\r\ngrandfather, in despair at seeing his sick wife deprived of all care\r\nand assistance, hanged himself. His corpse rotted in sight of the son,\r\nwho was scarcely able to care for his sick mother, and the stench\r\nfrom it led to their discovery. Her husband's death was attributed\r\nto her, for of what is the wife of a wretch, a woman who has been\r\na prostitute besides, not believed to be capable? If she swears,\r\nthey call her a perjurer; if she weeps, they say that she is acting;\r\nand that she blasphemes when she calls on God. Nevertheless, they\r\nhad pity on her condition and waited for the birth of another child\r\nbefore they flogged her. You know how the friars spread the belief\r\nthat the Indians can only be managed by blows: read what Padre Gaspar\r\nde San Agustin says! [134]\r\n\r\n\"A woman thus condemned will curse the day on which her child is born,\r\nand this, besides prolonging her torture, violates every maternal\r\nsentiment. Unfortunately, she brought forth a healthy child. Two months\r\nafterwards, the sentence was executed to the great satisfaction of\r\nthe men who thought that thus they were performing their duty. Not\r\nbeing at peace in these mountains, she then fled with her two sons\r\nto a neighboring province, where they lived like wild beasts, hating\r\nand hated. The elder of the two boys still remembered, even amid so\r\nmuch misery, the happiness of his infancy, so he became a tulisan as\r\nsoon as he found himself strong enough. Before long the bloody name\r\nof Balat spread from province to province, a terror to the people,\r\nbecause in his revenge he did everything with blood and fire. The\r\nyounger, who was by nature kind-hearted, resigned himself to his\r\nshameful fate along with his mother, and they lived on what the woods\r\nafforded, clothing themselves in the cast-off rags of travelers. She\r\nhad lost her name, being known only as _the convict, the prostitute,\r\nthe scourged_. He was known as the son of his mother only, because\r\nthe gentleness of his disposition led every one to believe that he\r\nwas not the son of the incendiary and because any doubt as to the\r\nmorality of the Indians can be held reasonable.\r\n\r\n\"At last, one day the notorious Balat fell into the clutches of the\r\nauthorities, who exacted of him a strict accounting for his crimes,\r\nand of his mother for having done nothing to rear him properly. One\r\nmorning the younger brother went to look for his mother, who had\r\ngone into the woods to gather mushrooms and had not returned. He\r\nfound her stretched out on the ground under a cotton-tree beside the\r\nhighway, her face turned toward the sky, her eyes fixed and staring,\r\nher clenched hands buried in the blood-stained earth. Some impulse\r\nmoved him to look up in the direction toward which the eyes of the\r\ndead woman were staring, and he saw hanging from a branch a basket\r\nand in the basket the gory head of his brother!\"\r\n\r\n\"My God!\" ejaculated Ibarra.\r\n\r\n\"That might have been the exclamation of my father,\" continued Elias\r\ncoldly. \"The body of the brigand had been cut up and the trunk buried,\r\nbut his limbs were distributed and hung up in different towns. If\r\never you go from Kalamba to Santo Tomas you will still see a withered\r\nlomboy-tree where one of my uncle's legs hung rotting--nature has\r\nblasted the tree so that it no longer grows or bears fruit. The same\r\nwas done with the other limbs, but the head, as the best part of the\r\nperson and the portion most easily recognizable, was hung up in front\r\nof his mother's hut!\"\r\n\r\nIbarra bowed his head.\r\n\r\n\"The boy fled like one accursed,\" Elias went on. \"He fled from town\r\nto town by mountain and valley. When he thought that he had reached\r\na place where he was not known, he hired himself out as a laborer in\r\nthe house of a rich man in the province of Tayabas. His activity and\r\nthe gentleness of his character gained him the good-will of all who\r\ndid not know his past, and by his thrift and economy he succeeded in\r\naccumulating a little capital. He was still young, he thought his\r\nsorrows buried in the past, and he dreamed of a happy future. His\r\npleasant appearance, his youth, and his somewhat unfortunate condition\r\nwon him the love of a young woman of the town, but he dared not ask\r\nfor her hand from fear that his past might become known. But love\r\nis stronger than anything else and they wandered from the straight\r\npath, so, to save the woman's honor, he risked everything by asking\r\nfor her in marriage. The records were sought and his whole past\r\nbecame known. The girl's father was rich and succeeded in having him\r\nprosecuted. He did not try to defend himself but admitted everything,\r\nand so was sent to prison. The woman gave birth to twins, a boy and a\r\ngirl, who were nurtured in secret and made to believe that their father\r\nwas dead no difficult matter, since at a tender age they saw their\r\nmother die, and they gave little thought to tracing genealogies. As our\r\nmaternal grandfather was rich our childhood passed happily. My sister\r\nand I were brought up together, loving one another as only twins can\r\nlove when they have no other affections. When quite young I was sent\r\nto study in the Jesuit College, and my sister, in order that we might\r\nnot be completely separated, entered the Concordia College. [135] After\r\nour brief education was finished, since we desired only to be farmers,\r\nwe returned to the town to take possession of the inheritance left\r\nus by our grandfather. We lived happily for a time, the future smiled\r\non us, we had many servants, our' fields produced abundant harvests,\r\nand my sister was about to be married to a young man whom she adored\r\nand who responded equally to her affection.\r\n\r\n\"But in a dispute over money and by reason of my haughty disposition\r\nat that time, I alienated the good will of a distant relative, and\r\none day he east in my face my doubtful birth and shameful descent. I\r\nthought it all a slander and demanded satisfaction. The tomb which\r\ncovered so much rottenness was again opened and to my consternation\r\nthe whole truth came out to overwhelm me. To add to our sorrow, we\r\nhad had for many years an old servant who had endured all my whims\r\nwithout ever leaving us, contenting himself merely with weeping and\r\ngroaning at the rough jests of the other servants. I don't know how my\r\nrelative had found it out, but the fact is that he had this old man\r\nsummoned into court and made him tell the truth: that old servant,\r\nwho had clung to his beloved children, and whom I had abused many\r\ntimes, was my father! Our happiness faded away, I gave up our fortune,\r\nmy sister lost her betrothed, and with our father we left the town\r\nto seek refuge elsewhere. The thought that he had contributed to\r\nour misfortunes shortened the old man's days, but before he died I\r\nlearned from his lips the whole story of the sorrowful past.\r\n\r\n\"My sister and I were left alone. She wept a great deal, but even\r\nin the midst of such great sorrows as heaped themselves upon us,\r\nshe could not forget her love. Without complaining, without uttering\r\na word, she saw her former sweetheart married to another girl, but I\r\nwatched her gradually sicken without being able to console her. One\r\nday she disappeared, and it was in vain that I sought everywhere,\r\nin vain I made inquiries about her. About six months afterwards I\r\nlearned that about that time, after a flood on the lake, there had\r\nbeen found in some rice fields bordering on the beach at Kalamba,\r\nthe corpse of a young woman who had been either drowned or murdered,\r\nfor she had had, so they said, a knife sticking in her breast. The\r\nofficials of that town published the fact in the country round about,\r\nbut no one came to claim the body, no young woman apparently had\r\ndisappeared. From the description they gave me afterward of her dress,\r\nher ornaments, the beauty of her countenance, and her abundant hair,\r\nI recognized in her my poor sister.\r\n\r\n\"Since then I have wandered from province to province. My reputation\r\nand my history are in the mouths of many. They attribute great deeds\r\nto me, sometimes calumniating me, but I pay little attention to men,\r\nkeeping ever on my way. Such in brief is my story, a story of one of\r\nthe judgments of men.\"\r\n\r\nElias fell silent as he rowed along.\r\n\r\n\"I still believe that you are not wrong,\" murmured Crisostomo in a low\r\nvoice, \"when you say that justice should seek to do good by rewarding\r\nvirtue and educating the criminals. Only, it's impossible, Utopian! And\r\nwhere could be secured so much money, so many new employees?\"\r\n\r\n\"For what, then, are the priests who proclaim their mission of peace\r\nand charity? Is it more meritorious to moisten the head of a child\r\nwith water, to give it salt to eat, than to awake in the benighted\r\nconscience of a criminal that spark which God has granted to every\r\nman to light him to his welfare? Is it more humane to accompany\r\na criminal to the scaffold than to lead him along the difficult\r\npath from vice to virtue? Don't they also pay spies, executioners,\r\ncivil-guards? These things, besides being dirty, also cost money.\"\r\n\r\n\"My friend, neither you nor I, although we may wish it, can accomplish\r\nthis.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alone, it is true, we are nothing, but take up the cause of the\r\npeople, unite yourself with the people, be not heedless of their\r\ncries, set an example to the rest, spread the idea of what is called\r\na fatherland!\"\r\n\r\n\"What the people ask for is impossible. We must wait.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait! To wait means to suffer!\"\r\n\r\n\"If I should ask for it, the powers that be would laugh at me.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if the people supported you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never! I will never be the one to lead the multitude to get by force\r\nwhat the government does not think proper to grant, no! If I should\r\never see that multitude armed I would place myself on the side of the\r\ngovernment, for in such a mob I should not see my countrymen. I desire\r\nthe country's welfare, therefore I would build a schoolhouse. I seek\r\nit by means of instruction, by progressive advancement; without light\r\nthere is no road.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither is there liberty without strife!\" answered Elias.\r\n\r\n\"The fact is that I don't want that liberty!\"\r\n\r\n\"The fact is that without liberty there is no light,\" replied the\r\npilot with warmth. \"You say that you are only slightly acquainted\r\nwith your country, and I believe you. You don't see the struggle that\r\nis preparing, you don't see the cloud on the horizon. The fight is\r\nbeginning in the sphere of ideas, to descend later into the arena,\r\nwhich will be dyed with blood. I hear the voice of God--woe unto them\r\nwho would oppose it! For them History has not been written!\"\r\n\r\nElias was transfigured; standing uncovered, with his manly face\r\nilluminated by the moon, there was something extraordinary about\r\nhim. He shook his long hair, and went on:\r\n\r\n\"Don't you see how everything is awakening? The sleep has lasted for\r\ncenturies, but one day the thunderbolt [136] struck, and in striking,\r\ninfused life. Since then new tendencies are stirring our spirits,\r\nand these tendencies, today scattered, will some day be united, guided\r\nby the God who has not failed other peoples and who will not fail us,\r\nfor His cause is the cause of liberty!\"\r\n\r\nA solemn silence followed these words, while the banka, carried along\r\ninsensibly by the waves, neared the shore.\r\n\r\nElias was the first to break the silence. \"What shall I tell those\r\nwho sent me?\" he asked with a change from his former tone.\r\n\r\n\"I've already told you: I greatly deplore their condition, but\r\nthey should wait. Evils are not remedied by other evils, and in our\r\nmisfortunes each of us has his share of blame.\"\r\n\r\nElias did not again reply, but dropped his head and rowed along until\r\nthey reached the shore, where he took leave of Ibarra: \"I thank you,\r\nsir, for the condescension you have shown me. Now, for your own good,\r\nI beg of you that in the future you forget me and that you do not\r\nrecognize me again, no matter in what situation you may find me.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he drew away in the banka, rowing toward a thicket on the\r\nshore. As he covered the long distance he remained silent, apparently\r\nintent upon nothing but the thousands of phosphorescent diamonds\r\nthat the oar caught up and dropped back into the lake, where they\r\ndisappeared mysteriously into the blue waves.\r\n\r\nWhen he had reached the shadow of the thicket a man came out of it\r\nand approached the banka. \"What shall I tell the capitan?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Tell him that Elias, if he lives, will keep his word,\" was the\r\nsad answer.\r\n\r\n\"When will you join us, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"When your capitan thinks that the hour of danger has come.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well. Good-by!\"\r\n\r\n\"If I don't die first,\" added Elias in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI\r\n\r\nExchanges\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bashful Linares was anxious and ill at ease. He had just received\r\nfrom Doña Victorina a letter which ran thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n    DEER COZIN within 3 days i expec to here from you if the\r\n    alferes has killed you or you him i dont want anuther day to\r\n    pass befour that broot has his punishment if that tim passes\r\n    an you havent challenjed him ill tel don santiago you was\r\n    never segretary nor joked with canobas nor went on a spree\r\n    with the general don arseño martinez ill tel clarita its all\r\n    a humbug an ill not give you a sent more if you challenje him\r\n    i promis all you want so lets see you challenje him i warn you\r\n    there must be no excuses nor delays yore cozin who loves you\r\n\r\n    VICTORINA DE LOS REYES DE DE ESPADAÑA\r\n\r\n    sampaloc monday 7 in the evening\r\n\r\n\r\nThe affair was serious. He was well enough acquainted with the\r\ncharacter of Doña Victorina to know what she was capable of. To talk\r\nto her of reason was to talk of honesty and courtesy to a revenue\r\ncarbineer when he proposes to find contraband where there is none,\r\nto plead with her would be useless, to deceive her worse--there was\r\nno way out of the difficulty but to send the challenge.\r\n\r\n\"But how? Suppose he receives me with violence?\" he soliloquized,\r\nas he paced to and fro. \"Suppose I find him with his señora? Who will\r\nbe willing to be my second? The curate? Capitan Tiago? Damn the hour\r\nin which I listened to her advice! The old toady! To oblige me to\r\nget myself tangled up, to tell lies, to make a blustering fool of\r\nmyself! What will the young lady say about me? Now I'm sorry that\r\nI've been secretary to all the ministers!\"\r\n\r\nWhile the good Linares was in the midst of his soliloquy, Padre Salvi\r\ncame in. The Franciscan was even thinner and paler than usual, but his\r\neyes gleamed with a strange light and his lips wore a peculiar smile.\r\n\r\n\"Señor Linares, all alone?\" was his greeting as he made his way to\r\nthe sala, through the half-opened door of which floated the notes\r\nfrom a piano. Linares tried to smile.\r\n\r\n\"Where is Don Santiago?\" continued the curate.\r\n\r\nCapitan Tiago at that moment appeared, kissed the curate's hand, and\r\nrelieved him of his hat and cane, smiling all the while like one of\r\nthe blessed.\r\n\r\n\"Come, come!\" exclaimed the curate, entering the sala, followed by\r\nLinares and Capitan Tiago, \"I have good news for you all. I've just\r\nreceived letters from Manila which confirm the one Señor Ibarra\r\nbrought me yesterday. So, Don Santiago, the objection is removed.\"\r\n\r\nMaria Clara, who was seated at the piano between her two friends,\r\npartly rose, but her strength failed her, and she fell back\r\nagain. Linares turned pale and looked at Capitan Tiago, who dropped\r\nhis eyes.\r\n\r\n\"That young man seems to me to be very agreeable,\" continued the\r\ncurate. \"At first I misjudged him--he's a little quick-tempered--but\r\nhe knows so well how to atone for his faults afterwards that one\r\ncan't hold anything against him. If it were not for Padre Damaso--\"\r\n\r\nHere the curate shot a quick glance at Maria Clara, who was listening\r\nwithout taking her eyes off the sheet of music, in spite of the sly\r\npinches of Sinang, who was thus expressing her joy--had she been\r\nalone she would have danced.\r\n\r\n\"Padre Damaso?\" queried Linares.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Padre Damaso has said,\" the curate went on, without taking\r\nhis gaze from Maria Clara, \"that as--being her sponsor in baptism,\r\nhe can't permit--but, after all, I believe that if Señor Ibarra begs\r\nhis pardon, which I don't doubt he'll do, everything will be settled.\"\r\n\r\nMaria Clara rose, made some excuse, and retired to her chamber,\r\naccompanied by Victoria.\r\n\r\n\"But if Padre Damaso doesn't pardon him?\" asked Capitan Tiago in a\r\nlow voice.\r\n\r\n\"Then Maria Clara will decide. Padre Damaso is her\r\nfather--spiritually. But I think they'll reach an understanding.\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment footsteps were heard and Ibarra appeared, followed\r\nby Aunt Isabel. His appearance produced varied impressions. To his\r\naffable greeting Capitan Tiago did not know whether to laugh or to\r\ncry. He acknowledged the presence of Linares with a profound bow. Fray\r\nSalvi arose and extended his hand so cordially that the youth could\r\nnot restrain a look of astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be surprised,\" said Fray Salvi, \"for I was just now praising\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nIbarra thanked him and went up to Sinang, who began with her childish\r\ngarrulity, \"Where have you been all day? We were all asking, where\r\ncan that soul redeemed from purgatory have gone? And we all said the\r\nsame thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"May I know what you said?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, that's a secret, but I'll tell you soon alone. Now tell me where\r\nyou've been, so we can see who guessed right.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, that's also a secret, but I'll tell you alone, if these gentlemen\r\nwill excuse us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, certainly, by all means!\" exclaimed Padre Salvi.\r\n\r\nRejoicing over the prospect of learning a secret, Sinang led Crisostomo\r\nto one end of the sala.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, little friend,\" he asked, \"is Maria angry with me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, but she says that it's better for you to forget her,\r\nthen she begins to cry. Capitan Tiago wants her to marry that man. So\r\ndoes Padre Damaso, but she doesn't say either yes or no. This morning\r\nwhen we were talking about you and I said, 'Suppose he has gone to\r\nmake love to some other girl?' she answered, 'Would that he had!' and\r\nbegan to cry.\"\r\n\r\nIbarra became grave. \"Tell Maria that I want to talk with her alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alone?\" asked Sinang, wrinkling her eyebrows and staring at him.\r\n\r\n\"Entirely alone, no, but not with that fellow present.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's rather difficult, but don't worry, I'll tell her.\"\r\n\r\n\"When shall I have an answer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tomorrow come to my house early. Maria doesn't want to be left alone\r\nat all, so we stay with her. Victoria sleeps with her one night and\r\nI the other, and tonight it's my turn. But listen, your secret? Are\r\nyou going away without telling me?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right! I was in the town of Los Baños. I'm going to develop\r\nsome coconut-groves and I'm thinking of putting up an oil-mill. Your\r\nfather will be my partner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing more than that? What a secret!\" exclaimed Sinang aloud,\r\nin the tone of a cheated usurer. \"I thought--\"\r\n\r\n\"Be careful! I don't want you to make it known!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor do I want to do it,\" replied Sinang, turning up her nose. \"If\r\nit were something more important, I would tell my friends. But to\r\nbuy coconuts! Coconuts! Who's interested in coconuts?\" And with\r\nextraordinary haste she ran to join her friends.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later Ibarra, seeing that the interest of the party\r\ncould only languish, took his leave. Capitan Tiago wore a bitter-sweet\r\nlook, Linares was silent and watchful, while the curate with assumed\r\ncheerfulness talked of indifferent matters. None of the girls had\r\nreappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII\r\n\r\nThe Cards of the Dead and the Shadows\r\n\r\n\r\nThe moon was hidden in a cloudy sky while a cold wind, precursor\r\nof the approaching December, swept the dry leaves and dust about in\r\nthe narrow pathway leading to the cemetery. Three shadowy forms were\r\nconversing in low tones under the arch of the gateway.\r\n\r\n\"Have you spoken to Elias?\" asked a voice.\r\n\r\n\"No, you know how reserved and circumspect he is. But he ought to be\r\none of us. Don Crisostomo saved his life.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's why I joined,\" said the first voice. \"Don Crisostomo had my\r\nwife cured in the house of a doctor in Manila. I'll look after the\r\nconvento to settle some old scores with the curate.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we'll take care of the barracks to show the civil-guards that\r\nour father had sons.\"\r\n\r\n\"How many of us will there be?\"\r\n\r\n\"Five, and five will be enough. Don Crisostomo's servant, though,\r\nsays there'll be twenty of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"What if you don't succeed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hist!\" exclaimed one of the shadows, and all fell silent.\r\n\r\nIn the semi-obscurity a shadowy figure was seen to approach,\r\nsneaking along by the fence. From time to time it stopped as if\r\nto look back. Nor was reason for this movement lacking, since some\r\ntwenty paces behind it came another figure, larger and apparently\r\ndarker than the first, but so lightly did it touch the ground that\r\nit vanished as rapidly as though the earth had swallowed it every\r\ntime the first shadow paused and turned.\r\n\r\n\"They're following me,\" muttered the first figure. \"Can it be the\r\ncivil-guards? Did the senior sacristan lie?\"\r\n\r\n\"They said that they would meet here,\" thought the second shadow. \"Some\r\nmischief must be on foot when the two brothers conceal it from me.\"\r\n\r\nAt length the first shadow reached the gateway of the cemetery. The\r\nthree who were already there stepped forward.\r\n\r\n\"Is that you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that you?\"\r\n\r\n\"We must scatter, for they've followed me. Tomorrow you'll get the arms\r\nand tomorrow night is the time. The cry is, 'Viva Don Crisostomo!' Go!\"\r\n\r\nThe three shadows disappeared behind the stone walls. The later\r\narrival hid in the hollow of the gateway and waited silently. \"Let's\r\nsee who's following me,\" he thought.\r\n\r\nThe second shadow came up very cautiously and paused as if to look\r\nabout him. \"I'm late,\" he muttered, \"but perhaps they will return.\"\r\n\r\nA thin fine rain, which threatened to last, began to fall, so it\r\noccurred to him to take refuge under the gateway. Naturally, he ran\r\nagainst the other.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! Who are you?\" asked the latest arrival in a rough tone.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\" returned the other calmly, after which there followed\r\na moment's pause as each tried to recognize the other's voice and to\r\nmake out his features.\r\n\r\n\"What are you waiting here for?\" asked he of the rough voice.\r\n\r\n\"For the clock to strike eight so that I can play cards with the\r\ndead. I want to win something tonight,\" answered the other in a\r\nnatural tone. \"And you, what have you come for?\"\r\n\r\n\"For--for the same purpose.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Abá!_ I'm glad of that, I'll not be alone. I've brought cards. At\r\nthe first stroke of the bell I'll make the lay, at the second I'll\r\ndeal. The cards that move are the cards of the dead and we'll have\r\nto cut for them. Have you brought cards?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then how--\"\r\n\r\n\"It's simple enough--just as you're going to deal for them, so I\r\nexpect them to play for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what if the dead don't play?\"\r\n\r\n\"What can we do? Gambling hasn't yet been made compulsory among\r\nthe dead.\"\r\n\r\nA short silence ensued.\r\n\r\n\"Are you armed? How are you going to fight with the dead?\"\r\n\r\n\"With my fists,\" answered the larger of the two.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, the devil! Now I remember--the dead won't bet when there's more\r\nthan one living person, and there are two of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that right? Well, I don't want to leave.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor I. I'm short of money,\" answered the smaller. \"But let's do this:\r\nlet's play for it, the one who loses to leave.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" agreed the other, rather ungraciously. \"Then let's\r\nget inside. Have you any matches?\" They went in to seek in the\r\nsemi-obscurity for a suitable place and soon found a niche in which\r\nthey could sit. The shorter took some cards from his salakot, while\r\nthe other struck a match, in the light from which they stared at\r\neach other, but, from the expressions on their faces, apparently\r\nwithout recognition. Nevertheless, we can recognize in the taller\r\nand deep-voiced one Elias and in the shorter one, from the scar on\r\nhis cheek, Lucas.\r\n\r\n\"Cut!\" called Lucas, still staring at the other. He pushed aside some\r\nbones that were in the niche and dealt an ace and a jack.\r\n\r\nElias lighted match after match. \"On the jack!\" he said, and to\r\nindicate the card placed a vertebra on top of it.\r\n\r\n\"Play!\" called Lucas, as he dealt an ace with the fourth or fifth\r\ncard. \"You've lost,\" he added. \"Now leave me alone so that I can try\r\nto make a raise.\"\r\n\r\nElias moved away without a word and was soon swallowed up in the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nSeveral minutes later the church-clock struck eight and the bell\r\nannounced the hour of the souls, but Lucas invited no one to play nor\r\ndid he call on the dead, as the superstition directs; instead, he took\r\noff his hat and muttered a few prayers, crossing and recrossing himself\r\nwith the same fervor with which, at that same moment, the leader of the\r\nBrotherhood of the Holy Rosary was going through a similar performance.\r\n\r\nThroughout the night a drizzling rain continued to fall. By nine\r\no'clock the streets were dark and solitary. The coconut-oil lanterns,\r\nwhich the inhabitants were required to hang out, scarcely illuminated\r\na small circle around each, seeming to be lighted only to render the\r\ndarkness more apparent. Two civil-guards paced back and forth in the\r\nstreet near the church.\r\n\r\n\"It's cold!\" said one in Tagalog with a Visayan accent. \"We haven't\r\ncaught any sacristan, so there is no one to repair the alferez's\r\nchicken-coop. They're all scared out by the death of that other\r\none. This makes me tired.\"\r\n\r\n\"Me, too,\" answered the other. \"No one commits robbery, no one raises\r\na disturbance, but, thank God, they say that Elias is in town. The\r\nalferez says that whoever catches him will be exempt from floggings\r\nfor three months.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aha! Do you remember his description?\" asked the Visayan.\r\n\r\n\"I should say so! Height: tall, according to the alferez, medium,\r\naccording to Padre Damaso; color, brown; eyes, black; nose, ordinary;\r\nbeard, none; hair, black.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aha! But special marks?\"\r\n\r\n\"Black shirt, black pantaloons, wood-cutter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aha, he won't get away from me! I think I see him now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't mistake him for any one else, even though he might look\r\nlike him.\"\r\n\r\nThus the two soldiers continued on their round.\r\n\r\nBy the light of the lanterns we may again see two shadowy figures\r\nmoving cautiously along, one behind the other. An energetic \"_Quién\r\nvive?_\" stops both, and the first answers, \"_España!_\" in a trembling\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers seize him and hustle him toward a lantern to examine\r\nhim. It is Lucas, but the soldiers seem to be in doubt, questioning\r\neach other with their eyes.\r\n\r\n\"The alferez didn't say that he had a scar,\" whispered the\r\nVisayan. \"Where you going?\"\r\n\r\n\"To order a mass for tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Haven't you seen Elias?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know him, sir,\" answered Lucas.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't ask you if you know him, you fool! Neither do we know\r\nhim. I'm asking you if you've seen him.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen, I'll describe him: Height, sometimes tall, sometimes medium;\r\nhair and eyes, black; all the other features, ordinary,\" recited the\r\nVisayan. \"Now do you know him?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir,\" replied Lucas stupidly.\r\n\r\n\"Then get away from here! Brute! Dolt!\" And they gave him a shove.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know why Elias is tall to the alferez and of medium height\r\nto the curate?\" asked the Tagalog thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered the Visayan.\r\n\r\n\"Because the alferez was down in the mudhole when he saw him and the\r\ncurate was on foot.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right!\" exclaimed the Visayan. \"You're talented--blow is it\r\nthat you're a civil-guard?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wasn't always one; I was a smuggler,\" answered the Tagalog with\r\na touch of pride.\r\n\r\nBut another shadowy figure diverted their attention. They challenged\r\nthis one also and took the man to the light.\r\n\r\nThis time it was the real Elias.\r\n\r\n\"Where you going?\"\r\n\r\n\"To look for a man, sir, who beat and threatened my brother. He has\r\na scar on his face and is called Elias.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aha!\" exclaimed the two guards, gazing at each other in astonishment,\r\nas they started on the run toward the church, where Lucas had\r\ndisappeared a few moments before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII\r\n\r\nIl Buon Dí Si Conosce Da Mattina [137]\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning the report spread through the town that many\r\nlights had been seen in the cemetery on the previous night. The leader\r\nof the Venerable Tertiary Order spoke of lighted candles, of their\r\nshape and size, and, although he could not fix the exact number, had\r\ncounted more than twenty. Sister Sipa, of the Brotherhood of the Holy\r\nRosary, could not bear the thought that a member of a rival order\r\nshould alone boast of having seen this divine marvel, so she, even\r\nthough she did not live near the place, had heard cries and groans,\r\nand even thought she recognized by their voices certain persons with\r\nwhom she, in other times,--but out of Christian charity she not only\r\nforgave them but prayed for them and would keep their names secret,\r\nfor all of which she was declared on the spot to be a saint. Sister\r\nRufa was not so keen of hearing, but she could not suffer that Sister\r\nSipa had heard so much and she nothing, so she related a dream in\r\nwhich there had appeared before her many souls--not only of the\r\ndead but even of the living--souls in torment who begged for a part\r\nof those indulgences of hers which were so carefully recorded and\r\ntreasured. She could furnish names to the families interested and\r\nonly asked for a few alms to succor the Pope in his needs. A little\r\nfellow, a herder, who dared to assert that he had seen nothing more\r\nthan one light and two men in salakots had difficulty in escaping\r\nwith mere slaps and scoldings. Vainly he swore to it; there were his\r\ncarabaos with him and could verify his statement. \"Do you pretend\r\nto know more than the Warden and the Sisters, _paracmason_, [138]\r\nheretic?\" he was asked amid angry looks. The curate went up into the\r\npulpit and preached about purgatory so fervently that the pesos again\r\nflowed forth from their hiding-places to pay for masses.\r\n\r\nBut let us leave the suffering souls and listen to the conversation\r\nbetween Don Filipo and old Tasio in the lonely home of the latter. The\r\nSage, or Lunatic, was sick, having been for days unable to leave his\r\nbed, prostrated by a malady that was rapidly growing worse.\r\n\r\n\"Really, I don't know whether to congratulate you or not that your\r\nresignation has been accepted. Formerly, when the gobernadorcillo so\r\nshamelessly disregarded the will of the majority, it was right for\r\nyou to tender it, but now that you are engaged in a contest with the\r\nCivil Guard it's not quite proper. In time of war you ought to remain\r\nat your post.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but not when the general sells himself,\" answered Don\r\nFilipo. \"You know that on the following morning the gobernadorcillo\r\nliberated the soldiers that I had succeeded in arresting and refused\r\nto take any further action. Without the consent of my superior officer\r\nI could do nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"You alone, nothing; but with the rest, much. You should have\r\ntaken advantage of this opportunity to set an example to the other\r\ntowns. Above the ridiculous authority of the gobernadorcillo are the\r\nrights of the people. It was the beginning of a good lesson and you\r\nhave neglected it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what could I have done against the representative of the\r\ninterests? Here you have Señor Ibarra, he has bowed before the beliefs\r\nof the crowd. Do you think that he believes in excommunications?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are not in the same fix. Señor Ibarra is trying to sow the good\r\nseed, and to do so he must bend himself and make what use he can of\r\nthe material at hand. Your mission was to stir things up, and for that\r\npurpose initiative and force are required. Besides, the fight should\r\nnot be considered as merely against the gobernadorcillo. The principle\r\nought to be, against him who makes wrong use of his authority,\r\nagainst him who disturbs the public peace, against him who fails in\r\nhis duty. You would not have been alone, for the country is not the\r\nsame now that it was twenty years ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think so?\" asked Don Filipo.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you feel it?\" rejoined the old man, sitting up in his bed. \"Ah,\r\nthat is because you haven't seen the past, you haven't studied the\r\neffect of European immigration, of the coming of new books, and\r\nof the movement of our youth to Europe. Examine and compare these\r\nfacts. It is true that the Royal and Pontifical University of Santo\r\nTomas, with its most sapient faculty, still exists and that some\r\nintelligences are yet exercised in formulating distinctions and in\r\npenetrating the subtleties of scholasticism; but where will you now\r\nfind the metaphysical youth of our days, with their archaic education,\r\nwho tortured their brains and died in full pursuit of sophistries\r\nin some corner of the provinces, without ever having succeeded in\r\nunderstanding the attributes of _being_, or solving the problem of\r\n_essence_ and _existence_, those lofty concepts that made us forget\r\nwhat was essential,--our own existence and our own individuality? Look\r\nat the youth of today! Full of enthusiasm at the view of a wider\r\nhorizon, they study history, mathematics, geography, literature,\r\nphysical sciences, languages--all subjects that in our times we heard\r\nmentioned with horror, as though they were heresies. The greatest\r\nfree-thinker of my day declared them inferior to the classifications of\r\nAristotle and the laws of the syllogism. Man has at last comprehended\r\nthat he is man; he has given up analyzing his God and searching into\r\nthe imperceptible, into what he has not seen; he has given up framing\r\nlaws for the phantasms of his brain; he comprehends that his heritage\r\nis the vast world, dominion over which is within his reach; weary of\r\nhis useless and presumptuous toil, he lowers his head and examines what\r\nsurrounds him. See how poets are now springing up among us! The Muses\r\nof Nature are gradually opening up their treasures to us and begin\r\nto smile in encouragement on our efforts; the experimental sciences\r\nhave already borne their first-fruits; time only is lacking for their\r\ndevelopment. The lawyers of today are being trained in the new forms of\r\nthe philosophy of law, some of them begin to shine in the midst of the\r\nshadows which surround our courts of justice, indicating a change in\r\nthe course of affairs. Hear how the youth talk, visit the centers of\r\nlearning! Other names resound within the walls of the schools, there\r\nwhere we heard only those of St. Thomas, Suarez, Amat, Sanchez, [139]\r\nand others who were the idols of our times. In vain do the friars cry\r\nout from the pulpits against our demoralization, as the fish-venders\r\ncry out against the cupidity of their customers, disregarding the\r\nfact that their wares are stale and unserviceable! In vain do the\r\nconventos extend their ramifications to check the new current. The\r\ngods are going! The roots of the tree may weaken the plants that\r\nsupport themselves under it, but they cannot take away life from\r\nthose other beings, which, like birds, are soaring toward the sky.\"\r\n\r\nThe Sage spoke with animation, his eyes gleamed.\r\n\r\n\"Still, the new seed is small,\" objected Don Filipo incredulously. \"If\r\nall enter upon the progress we purchase so dearly, it may be stifled.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stifled! Who will stifle it? Man, that weak dwarf, stifle progress,\r\nthe powerful child of time and action? When has he been able to do\r\nso? Bigotry, the gibbet, the stake, by endeavoring to stifle it,\r\nhave hurried it along. _E pur si muove_, [140] said Galileo, when\r\nthe Dominicans forced him to declare that the earth does not move,\r\nand the same statement might be applied to human progress. Some wills\r\nare broken down, some individuals sacrificed, but that is of little\r\nimport; progress continues on its way, and from the blood of those\r\nwho fall new and vigorous offspring is born. See, the press itself,\r\nhowever backward it may wish to be, is taking a step forward. The\r\nDominicans themselves do not escape the operation of this law, but are\r\nimitating the Jesuits, their irreconcilable enemies. They hold fiestas\r\nin their cloisters, they erect little theaters, they compose poems,\r\nbecause, as they are not devoid of intelligence in spite of believing\r\nin the fifteenth century, they realize that the Jesuits are right,\r\nand they will still take part in the future of the younger peoples\r\nthat they have reared.\"\r\n\r\n\"So, according to you, the Jesuits keep up with progress?\" asked Don\r\nFilipo in wonder. \"Why, then, are they opposed in Europe?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will answer you like an old scholastic,\" replied the Sage, lying\r\ndown again and resuming his jesting expression. \"There are three\r\nways in which one may accompany the course of progress: in front of,\r\nbeside, or behind it. The first guide it, the second suffer themselves\r\nto be carried along with it, and the last are dragged after it and to\r\nthese last the Jesuits belong. They would like to direct it, but as\r\nthey see that it is strong and has other tendencies, they capitulate,\r\npreferring to follow rather than to be crushed or left alone among the\r\nshadows by the wayside. Well now, we in the Philippines are moving\r\nalong at least three centuries behind the car of progress; we are\r\nbarely beginning to emerge from the Middle Ages. Hence the Jesuits,\r\nwho are reactionary in Europe, when seen from our point of view,\r\nrepresent progress. To them the Philippines owes her dawning system\r\nof instruction in the natural sciences, the soul of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, as she owed to the Dominicans scholasticism, already dead\r\nin spite of Leo XIII, for there is no Pope who can revive what common\r\nsense has judged and condemned.\r\n\r\n\"But where are we getting to?\" he asked with a change of tone. \"Ah,\r\nwe were speaking of the present condition of the Philippines. Yes,\r\nwe are now entering upon a period of strife, or rather, I should say\r\nthat you are, for my generation belongs to the night, we are passing\r\naway. This strife is between the past, which seizes and strives\r\nwith curses to cling to the tottering feudal castle, and the future,\r\nwhose song of triumph may be heard from afar amid the splendors of the\r\ncoming dawn, bringing the message of Good-News from other lands. Who\r\nwill fall and be buried in the moldering ruins?\"\r\n\r\nThe old man paused. Noticing that Don Filipo was gazing at him\r\nthoughtfully, he said with a smile, \"I can almost guess what you\r\nare thinking.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are thinking of how easily I may be mistaken,\" was the answer\r\nwith a sad smile. \"Today I am feverish, and I am not infallible: _homo\r\nsum et nihil humani a me alienum puto_, [141] said Terence, and if\r\nat any time one is allowed to dream, why not dream pleasantly in the\r\nlast hours of life? And after all, I have lived only in dreams! You\r\nare right, it is a dream! Our youths think only of love affairs and\r\ndissipations; they expend more time and work harder to deceive and\r\ndishonor a maiden than in thinking about the welfare of their country;\r\nour women, in order to care for the house and family of God, neglect\r\ntheir own: our men are active only in vice and heroic only in shame;\r\nchildhood develops amid ignorance and routine, youth lives its best\r\nyears without ideals, and a sterile manhood serves only as an example\r\nfor corrupting youth. Gladly do I die! _Claudite iam rivos, pueri!_\"\r\n[142]\r\n\r\n\"Don't you want some medicine?\" asked Don Filipo in order to change\r\nthe course of the conversation, which had darkened the old man's face.\r\n\r\n\"The dying need no medicines; you who remain need them. Tell Don\r\nCrisostomo to come and see me tomorrow, for I have some important\r\nthings to say to him. In a few days I am going away. The Philippines\r\nis in darkness!\"\r\n\r\nAfter a few moments more of talk, Don Filipo left the sick man's house,\r\ngrave and thoughtful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV\r\n\r\nRevelations\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tQuidquid latet, adparebit,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNil inultum remanebit. [143]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe vesper bells are ringing, and at the holy sound all pause, drop\r\ntheir tasks, and uncover. The laborer returning from the fields\r\nceases the song with which he was pacing his carabao and murmurs a\r\nprayer, the women in the street cross themselves and move their lips\r\naffectedly so that none may doubt their piety, a man stops caressing\r\nhis game-cock and recites the angelus to bring better luck, while\r\ninside the houses they pray aloud. Every sound but that of the Ave\r\nMaria dies away, becomes hushed.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the curate, without his hat, rushes across the street,\r\nto the scandalizing of many old women, and, greater scandal still,\r\ndirects his steps toward the house of the alferez. The devout women\r\nthen think it time to cease the movement of their lips in order to\r\nkiss the curate's hand, but Padre Salvi takes no notice of them. This\r\nevening he finds no pleasure in placing his bony hand on his Christian\r\nnose that he may slip it down dissemblingly (as Doña Consolacion\r\nhas observed) over the bosom of the attractive young woman who may\r\nhave bent over to receive his blessing. Some important matter must\r\nbe engaging his attention when he thus forgets his own interests and\r\nthose of the Church!\r\n\r\nIn fact, he rushes headlong up the stairway and knocks impatiently\r\nat the alferez's door. The latter puts in his appearance, scowling,\r\nfollowed by his better half, who smiles like one of the damned.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Padre, I was just going over to see you. That old goat of yours--\"\r\n\r\n\"I have a very important matter--\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't stand for his running about and breaking down the fence. I'll\r\nshoot him if he comes back!\"\r\n\r\n\"That is, if you are alive tomorrow!\" exclaimed the panting curate\r\nas he made his way toward the sala.\r\n\r\n\"What, do you think that puny doll will kill me? I'll bust him with\r\na kick!\"\r\n\r\nPadre Salvi stepped backward with an involuntary glance toward the\r\nalferez's feet. \"Whom are you talking about?\" he asked tremblingly.\r\n\r\n\"About whom would I talk but that simpleton who has challenged me to\r\na duel with revolvers at a hundred paces?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" sighed the curate, then he added, \"I've come to talk to you\r\nabout a very urgent matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough of urgent matters! It'll be like that affair of the two boys.\"\r\n\r\nHad the light been other than from coconut oil and the lamp globe\r\nnot so dirty, the alferez would have noticed the curate's pallor.\r\n\r\n\"Now this is a serious matter, which concerns the lives of all of us,\"\r\ndeclared Padre Salvi in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\"A serious matter?\" echoed the alferez, turning pale. \"Can that boy\r\nshoot straight?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not talking about him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, what?\"\r\n\r\nThe friar made a sign toward the door, which the alferez closed in\r\nhis own way--with a kick, for he had found his hands superfluous and\r\nhad lost nothing by ceasing to be bimanous.\r\n\r\nA curse and a roar sounded outside. \"Brute, you've split my forehead\r\nopen!\" yelled his wife.\r\n\r\n\"Now, unburden yourself,\" he said calmly to the curate.\r\n\r\nThe latter stared at him for a space, then asked in the nasal,\r\ndroning voice of the preacher, \"Didn't you see me come--running?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure! I thought you'd lost something.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, now,\" continued the curate, without heeding the alferez's\r\nrudeness, \"when I fail thus in my duty, it's because there are grave\r\nreasons.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what else?\" asked the other, tapping the floor with his foot.\r\n\r\n\"Be calm!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why did you come in such a hurry?\"\r\n\r\nThe curate drew nearer to him and asked mysteriously,\r\n\"Haven't--you--heard--anything?\"\r\n\r\nThe alferez shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"You admit that you know absolutely nothing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you want to talk about Elias, who put away your senior sacristan\r\nlast night?\" was the retort.\r\n\r\n\"No, I'm not talking about those matters,\" answered the curate\r\nill-naturedly. \"I'm talking about a great danger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, damn it, out with it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" said the friar slowly and disdainfully, \"you see once more\r\nhow important we ecclesiastics are. The meanest lay brother is worth\r\nas much as a regiment, while a curate--\"\r\n\r\nThen he added in a low and mysterious tone, \"I've discovered a big\r\nconspiracy!\"\r\n\r\nThe alferez started up and gazed in astonishment at the friar.\r\n\r\n\"A terrible and well-organized plot, which will be carried out this\r\nvery night.\"\r\n\r\n\"This very night!\" exclaimed the alferez, pushing the curate aside\r\nand running to his revolver and sword hanging on the wall.\r\n\r\n\"Who'll I arrest? Who'll I arrest?\" he cried.\r\n\r\n\"Calm yourself! There is still time, thanks to the promptness with\r\nwhich I have acted. We have till eight o'clock.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll shoot all of them!\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen_!_ This afternoon a woman whose name I can't reveal (it's a\r\nsecret of the confessional) came to me and told everything. At eight\r\no'clock they will seize the barracks by surprise, plunder the convento,\r\ncapture the police boat, and murder all of us Spaniards.\"\r\n\r\nThe alferez was stupefied.\r\n\r\n\"The woman did not tell me any more than this,\" added the curate.\r\n\r\n\"She didn't tell any more? Then I'll arrest her!\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't consent to that. The bar of penitence is the throne of the\r\nGod of mercies.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's neither God nor mercies that amount to anything! I'll\r\narrest her!\"\r\n\r\n\"You're losing your head! What you must do is to get yourself\r\nready. Muster your soldiers quietly and put them in ambush, send\r\nme four guards for the convento, and notify the men in charge of\r\nthe boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"The boat isn't here. I'll ask for help from the other sections.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, for then the plotters would be warned and would not carry out\r\ntheir plans. What we must do is to catch them alive and make them\r\ntalk--I mean, you'll make them talk, since I, as a priest, must not\r\nmeddle in such matters. Listen, here's where you win crosses and\r\nstars. I ask only that you make due acknowledgment that it was I who\r\nwarned you.\"\r\n\r\n\"It'll be acknowledged, Padre, it'll be acknowledged--and perhaps\r\nyou'll get a miter!\" answered the glowing alferez, glancing at the\r\ncuffs of his uniform.\r\n\r\n\"So, you send me four guards in plain clothes, eh? Be discreet,\r\nand tonight at eight o'clock it'll rain stars and crosses.\"\r\n\r\nWhile all this was taking place, a man ran along the road leading to\r\nIbarra's house and rushed up the stairway.\r\n\r\n\"Is your master here?\" the voice of Elias called to a servant.\r\n\r\n\"He's in his study at work.\"\r\n\r\nIbarra, to divert the impatience that he felt while waiting for the\r\ntime when he could make his explanations to Maria Clara, had set\r\nhimself to work in his laboratory.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, that you, Elias?\" he exclaimed. \"I was thinking about\r\nyou. Yesterday I forgot to ask you the name of that Spaniard in whose\r\nhouse your grandfather lived.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's not talk about me, sir--\"\r\n\r\n\"Look,\" continued Ibarra, not noticing the youth's agitation,\r\nwhile he placed a piece of bamboo over a flame, \"I've made a great\r\ndiscovery. This bamboo is incombustible.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's not a question of bamboo now, sir, it's a question of your\r\ncollecting your papers and fleeing at this very moment.\"\r\n\r\nIbarra glanced at him in surprise and, on seeing the gravity of his\r\ncountenance, dropped the object that he held in his hands.\r\n\r\n\"Burn everything that may compromise you and within an hour put\r\nyourself in a place of safety.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" Ibarra was at length able to ask.\r\n\r\n\"Put all your valuables in a safe place--\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Burn every letter written by you or to you--the most innocent thing\r\nmay be wrongly construed--\"\r\n\r\n\"But why all this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why! Because I've just discovered a plot that is to be attributed\r\nto you in order to ruin you.\"\r\n\r\n\"A plot? Who is forming it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't been able to discover the author of it, but just a moment\r\nago I talked with one of the poor dupes who are paid to carry it out,\r\nand I wasn't able to dissuade him.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he--didn't he tell you who is paying him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes! Under a pledge of secrecy he said that it was you.\"\r\n\r\n\"My God!\" exclaimed the terrified Ibarra.\r\n\r\n\"There's no doubt of it, sir. Don't lose any time, for the plot will\r\nprobably be carried out this very night.\"\r\n\r\nIbarra, with his hands on his head and his eyes staring unnaturally,\r\nseemed not to hear him.\r\n\r\n\"The blow cannot be averted,\" continued Elias. \"I've come late,\r\nI don't know who the leaders are. Save yourself, sir, save yourself\r\nfor your country's sake!\"\r\n\r\n\"Whither shall I flee? She expects me tonight!\" exclaimed Ibarra,\r\nthinking of Maria Clara.\r\n\r\n\"To any town whatsoever, to Manila, to the house of some official,\r\nbut anywhere so that they may not say that you are directing this\r\nmovement.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose that I myself report the plot?\"\r\n\r\n\"You an informer!\" exclaimed Elias, stepping back and staring at\r\nhim. \"You would appear as a traitor and coward in the eyes of the\r\nplotters and faint-hearted in the eyes of others. They would say that\r\nyou planned the whole thing to curry favor. They would say--\"\r\n\r\n\"But what's to be done?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've already told you. Destroy every document that relates to your\r\naffairs, flee, and await the outcome.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Maria Clara?\" exclaimed the young man. \"No, I'll die first!\"\r\n\r\nElias wrung his hands, saying, \"Well then, at least parry the\r\nblow. Prepare for the time when they accuse you.\"\r\n\r\nIbarra gazed about him in bewilderment. \"Then help me. There in\r\nthat writing-desk are all the letters of my family. Select those of\r\nmy father, which are perhaps the ones that may compromise me. Read\r\nthe signatures.\"\r\n\r\nSo the bewildered and stupefied young man opened and shut boxes,\r\ncollected papers, read letters hurriedly, tearing up some and laying\r\nothers aside. He took down some books and began to turn their leaves.\r\n\r\nElias did the same, if not so excitedly, yet with equal eagerness. But\r\nsuddenly he paused, his eyes bulged, he turned the paper in his hand\r\nover and over, then asked in a trembling voice:\r\n\r\n\"Was your family acquainted with Don Pedro Eibarramendia?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should say so!\" answered Ibarra, as he opened a chest and took\r\nout a bundle of papers. \"He was my great-grandfather.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your great-grandfather Don Pedro Eibarramendia?\" again asked Elias\r\nwith changed and livid features.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Ibarra absently, \"we shortened the surname; it was\r\ntoo long.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was he a Basque?\" demanded Elias, approaching him.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, a Basque--but what's the matter?\" asked Ibarra in surprise.\r\n\r\nClenching his fists and pressing them to his forehead, Elias glared\r\nat Crisostomo, who recoiled when he saw the expression on the other's\r\nface. \"Do you know who Don Pedro Eibarramendia was?\" he asked between\r\nhis teeth. \"Don Pedro Eibarramendia was the villain who falsely accused\r\nmy grandfather and caused all our misfortunes. I have sought for that\r\nname and God has revealed it to me! Render me now an accounting for\r\nour misfortunes!\"\r\n\r\nElias caught and shook the arm of Crisostomo, who gazed at him in\r\nterror. In a voice that was bitter and trembling with hate, he said,\r\n\"Look at me well, look at one who has suffered and you live, you live,\r\nyou have wealth, a home, reputation--you live, you live!\"\r\n\r\nBeside himself, he ran to a small collection of arms and snatched up\r\na dagger. But scarcely had he done so when he let it fall again and\r\nstared like a madman at the motionless Ibarra.\r\n\r\n\"What was I about to do?\" he muttered, fleeing from the house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV\r\n\r\nThe Catastrophe\r\n\r\n\r\nThere in the dining-room Capitan Tiago, Linares, and Aunt Isabel were\r\nat supper, so that even in the sala the rattling of plates and dishes\r\nwas plainly heard. Maria Clara had said that she was not hungry and\r\nhad seated herself at the piano in company with the merry Sinang,\r\nwho was murmuring mysterious words into her ear. Meanwhile Padre\r\nSalvi paced nervously back and forth in the room.\r\n\r\nIt was not, indeed, that the convalescent was not hungry, no; but she\r\nwas expecting the arrival of a certain person and was taking advantage\r\nof this moment when her Argus was not present, Linares' supper-hour.\r\n\r\n\"You'll see how that specter will stay till eight,\" murmured Sinang,\r\nindicating the curate. \"And at eight _he_ will come. The curate's in\r\nlove with Linares.\"\r\n\r\nMaria Clara gazed in consternation at her friend, who went on\r\nheedlessly with her terrible chatter: \"Oh, I know why he doesn't\r\ngo, in spite of my hints--he doesn't want to burn up oil in the\r\nconvento! Don't you know that since you've been sick the two lamps that\r\nhe used to keep lighted he has had put out? But look how he stares,\r\nand what a face!\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment a clock in the house struck eight. The curate shuddered\r\nand sat down in a corner.\r\n\r\n\"Here he comes!\" exclaimed Sinang, pinching Maria Clara. \"Don't you\r\nhear him?\"\r\n\r\nThe church bell boomed out the hour of eight and all rose to\r\npray. Padre Salvi offered up a prayer in a weak and trembling voice,\r\nbut as each was busy with his own thoughts no one paid any attention\r\nto the priest's agitation.\r\n\r\nScarcely had the prayer ceased when Ibarra appeared. The youth was\r\nin mourning not only in his attire but also in his face, to such an\r\nextent that, on seeing him, Maria Clara arose and took a step toward\r\nhim to ask what the matter was. But at that instant the report of\r\nfirearms was heard. Ibarra stopped, his eyes rolled, he lost the power\r\nof speech. The curate had concealed himself behind a post. More shots,\r\nmore reports were heard from the direction of the convento, followed\r\nby cries and the sound of persons running. Capitan Tiago, Aunt Isabel,\r\nand Linares rushed in pell-mell, crying, \"Tulisan! Tulisan!\" Andeng\r\nfollowed, flourishing the gridiron as she ran toward her foster-sister.\r\n\r\nAunt Isabel fell on her knees weeping and reciting the _Kyrie eleyson_;\r\nCapitan Tiago, pale and trembling, carried on his fork a chicken-liver\r\nwhich he offered tearfully to the Virgin of Antipolo; Linares with his\r\nmouth full of food was armed with a case-knife; Sinang and Maria Clara\r\nwere in each other's arms; while the only one that remained motionless,\r\nas if petrified, was Crisostomo, whose paleness was indescribable.\r\n\r\nThe cries and sound of blows continued, windows were closed noisily,\r\nthe report of a gun was heard from time to time.\r\n\r\n\"_Christie eleyson!_ Santiago, let the prophecy be fulfilled! Shut\r\nthe windows!\" groaned Aunt Isabel.\r\n\r\n\"Fifty big bombs and two thanksgiving masses!\" responded Capitan\r\nTiago. \"_Ora pro nobis!_\"\r\n\r\nGradually there prevailed a heavy silence which was soon broken by\r\nthe voice of the alferez, calling as he ran: \"Padre, Padre Salvi,\r\ncome here!\"\r\n\r\n\"_Miserere!_ The alferez is calling for confession,\" cried Aunt\r\nIsabel. \"The alferez is wounded?\" asked Linares hastily. \"Ah!!!\" Only\r\nthen did he notice that he had not yet swallowed what he had in\r\nhis mouth.\r\n\r\n\"Padre, come here! There's nothing more to fear!\" the alferez continued\r\nto call out.\r\n\r\nThe pallid Fray Salvi at last concluded to venture out from his\r\nhiding-place, and went down the stairs.\r\n\r\n\"The outlaws have killed the alferez! Maria, Sinang, go into your\r\nroom and fasten the door! _Kyrie eleyson!_\"\r\n\r\nIbarra also turned toward the stairway, in spite of Aunt Isabel's\r\ncries: \"Don't go out, you haven't been shriven, don't go out!\" The\r\ngood old lady had been a particular friend of his mother's.\r\n\r\nBut Ibarra left the house. Everything seemed to reel around him,\r\nthe ground was unstable. His ears buzzed, his legs moved heavily and\r\nirregularly. Waves of blood, lights and shadows chased one another\r\nbefore his eyes, and in spite of the bright moonlight he stumbled\r\nover the stones and blocks of wood in the vacant and deserted street.\r\n\r\nNear the barracks he saw soldiers, with bayonets fixed, who were\r\ntalking among themselves so excitedly that he passed them unnoticed. In\r\nthe town hall were to be heard blows, cries, and curses, with the\r\nvoice of the alferez dominating everything: \"To the stocks! Handcuff\r\nthem! Shoot any one who moves! Sergeant, mount the guard! Today no\r\none shall walk about, not even God! Captain, this is no time to go\r\nto sleep!\"\r\n\r\nIbarra hastened his steps toward home, where his servants were\r\nanxiously awaiting him. \"Saddle the best horse and go to bed!\" he\r\nordered them.\r\n\r\nGoing into his study, he hastily packed a traveling-bag, opened an\r\niron safe, took out what money he found there and put it into some\r\nsacks. Then he collected his jewels, took clown a portrait of Maria\r\nClara, armed himself with a dagger and two revolvers, and turned\r\ntoward a closet where he kept his instruments.\r\n\r\nAt that moment three heavy knocks sounded on the door. \"Who's\r\nthere?\" asked Ibarra in a gloomy tone.\r\n\r\n\"Open, in the King's name, open at once, or we'll break the door down,\"\r\nanswered an imperious voice in Spanish.\r\n\r\nIbarra looked toward the window, his eyes gleamed, and he cocked his\r\nrevolver. Then changing his mind, he put the weapons down and went\r\nto open the door just as the servant appeared. Three guards instantly\r\nseized him.\r\n\r\n\"Consider yourself a prisoner in the King's name,\" said the sergeant.\r\n\r\n\"For what?\"\r\n\r\n\"They'll tell you over there. We're forbidden to say.\" The youth\r\nreflected a moment and then, perhaps not wishing that the soldiers\r\nshould discover his preparations for flight, picked up his hat, saying,\r\n\"I'm at your service. I suppose that it will only be for a few hours.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you promise not to try to escape, we won't tie you the alferez\r\ngrants this favor--but if you run--\"\r\n\r\nIbarra went with them, leaving his servants in consternation.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, what had become of Elias? Leaving the house of Crisostomo,\r\nhe had run like one crazed, without heeding where he was going. He\r\ncrossed the fields in violent agitation, he reached the woods; he fled\r\nfrom the town, from the light--even the moon so troubled him that he\r\nplunged into the mysterious shadows of the trees. There, sometimes\r\npausing, sometimes moving along unfrequented paths, supporting himself\r\non the hoary trunks or being entangled in the undergrowth, he gazed\r\ntoward the town, which, bathed in the light of the moon, spread out\r\nbefore him on the plain along the shore of the lake. Birds awakened\r\nfrom their sleep flew about, huge bats and owls moved from branch to\r\nbranch with strident cries and gazed at him with their round eyes, but\r\nElias neither heard nor heeded them. In his fancy he was followed by\r\nthe offended shades of his family, he saw on every branch the gruesome\r\nbasket containing Balat's gory head, as his father had described it\r\nto him; at every tree he seemed to stumble over the corpse of his\r\ngrandmother; he imagined that he saw the rotting skeleton of his\r\ndishonored grandfather swinging among the shadows--and the skeleton\r\nand the corpse and the gory head cried after him, \"Coward! Coward!\"\r\n\r\nLeaving the hill, Elias descended to the lake and ran along the\r\nshore excitedly. There at a distance in the midst of the waters,\r\nwhere the moonlight seemed to form a cloud, he thought he could see a\r\nspecter rise and soar the shade of his sister with her breast bloody\r\nand her loose hair streaming about. He fell to his knees on the sand\r\nand extending his arms cried out, \"You, too!\"\r\n\r\nThen with his gaze fixed on the cloud he arose slowly and went forward\r\ninto the water as if he were following some one. He passed over the\r\ngentle slope that forms the bar and was soon far from the shore. The\r\nwater rose to his waist, but he plunged on like one fascinated,\r\nfollowing, ever following, the ghostly charmer. Now the water covered\r\nhis chest--a volley of rifle-shots sounded, the vision disappeared,\r\nthe youth returned to his senses. In the stillness of the night and\r\nthe greater density of the air the reports reached him clearly and\r\ndistinctly. He stopped to reflect and found himself in the water--over\r\nthe peaceful ripples of the lake he could still make out the lights\r\nin the fishermen's huts.\r\n\r\nHe returned to the shore and started toward the town, but for what\r\npurpose he himself knew not. The streets appeared to be deserted,\r\nthe houses were closed, and even the dogs that were wont to bark\r\nthrough the night had hidden themselves in fear. The silvery light\r\nof the moon added to the sadness and loneliness.\r\n\r\nFearful of meeting the civil-guards, he made his way along through\r\nyards and gardens, in one of which he thought he could discern two\r\nhuman figures, but he kept on his way, leaping over fences and walls,\r\nuntil after great labor he reached the other end of the town and\r\nwent toward Crisostomo's house. In the doorway were the servants,\r\nlamenting their master's arrest.\r\n\r\nAfter learning about what had occurred Elias pretended to go away,\r\nbut really went around behind the house, jumped over the wall, and\r\ncrawled through a window into the study where the candle that Ibarra\r\nhad lighted was still burning. He saw the books and papers and found\r\nthe arms, the jewels, and the sacks of money. Reconstructing in his\r\nimagination the scene that had taken place there and seeing so many\r\npapers that might be of a compromising nature, he decided to gather\r\nthem up, throw them from the window, and bury them.\r\n\r\nBut, on glancing toward the street, he saw two guards approaching,\r\ntheir bayonets and caps gleaming in the moonlight. With them was the\r\ndirectorcillo. He made a sudden resolution: throwing the papers and\r\nsome clothing into a heap in the center of the room, he poured over\r\nthem the oil from a lamp and set fire to the whole. He was hurriedly\r\nplacing the arms in his belt when he caught sight of the portrait\r\nof Maria Clara and hesitated a moment, then thrust it into one of\r\nthe sacks and with them in his hands leaped from the window into\r\nthe garden.\r\n\r\nIt was time that he did so, too, for the guards were forcing\r\nan entrance. \"Let us in to get your master's papers!\" cried the\r\ndirectorcillo.\r\n\r\n\"Have you permission? If you haven't, you won't get in,'\" answered\r\nan old man.\r\n\r\nBut the soldiers pushed him aside with the butts of their rifles and\r\nran up the stairway, just as a thick cloud of smoke rolled through the\r\nhouse and long tongues of flame shot out from the study, enveloping\r\nthe doors and windows.\r\n\r\n\"Fire! Fire!\" was the cry, as each rushed to save what he could. But\r\nthe blaze had reached the little laboratory and caught the inflammable\r\nmaterials there, so the guards had to retire. The flames roared about,\r\nlicking up everything in their way and cutting off the passages. Vainly\r\nwas water brought from the well and cries for help raised, for the\r\nhouse was set apart from the rest. The fire swept through all the\r\nrooms and sent toward the sky thick spirals of smoke. Soon the whole\r\nstructure was at the mercy of the flames, fanned now by the wind,\r\nwhich in the heat grew stronger. Some few rustics came up, but only\r\nto gaze on this great bonfire, the end of that old building which\r\nhad been so long respected by the elements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI\r\n\r\nRumors and Beliefs\r\n\r\n\r\nDay dawned at last for the terrified town. The streets near the\r\nbarracks and the town hail were still deserted and solitary, the\r\nhouses showed no signs of life. Nevertheless, the wooden panel of\r\na window was pushed back noisily and a child's head was stretched\r\nout and turned from side to side, gazing about in all directions. At\r\nonce, however, a smack indicated the contact of tanned hide with the\r\nsoft human article, so the child made a wry face, closed its eyes,\r\nand disappeared. The window slammed shut.\r\n\r\nBut an example had been set. That opening and shutting of the window\r\nhad no doubt been heard on all sides, for soon another window opened\r\nslowly and there appeared cautiously the head of a wrinkled and\r\ntoothless old woman: it was the same Sister Puté who had raised such a\r\ndisturbance while Padre Damaso was preaching. Children and old women\r\nare the representatives of curiosity in this world: the former from\r\na wish to know things and the latter from a desire to recollect them.\r\n\r\nApparently there was no one to apply a slipper to Sister Puté, for she\r\nremained gazing out into the distance with wrinkled eyebrows. Then she\r\nrinsed out her mouth, spat noisily, and crossed herself. In the house\r\nopposite, another window was now timidly opened to reveal Sister Rufa,\r\nshe who did not wish to cheat or be cheated. They stared at each other\r\nfor a moment, smiled, made some signs, and again crossed themselves.\r\n\r\n\"_Jesús_, it seemed like a thanksgiving mass, regular\r\nfireworks!\" commented Sister Rufa.\r\n\r\n\"Since the town was sacked by Balat, I've never seen another night\r\nequal to it,\" responded Sister Puté.\r\n\r\n\"What a lot of shots! They say that it was old Pablo's band.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tulisanes? That can't be! They say that it was the cuadrilleros\r\nagainst the civil-guards. That's why Don Filipo has been arrested.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Sanctus Deus!_ They say that at least fourteen were killed.\"\r\n\r\nOther windows were now opened and more faces appeared to exchange\r\ngreetings and make comments. In the clear light, which promised a\r\nbright day, soldiers could be seen in the distance, coming and going\r\nconfusedly like gray silhouettes.\r\n\r\n\"There goes one more corpse!\" was the exclamation from a window.\r\n\r\n\"One? I see two.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I--but really, can it be you don't know what it was?\" asked a\r\nsly-featured individual.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, the cuadrilleros!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, it was a mutiny in the barracks!\"\r\n\r\n\"What kind of mutiny? The curate against the alferez?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it was nothing of the kind,\" answered the man who had asked the\r\nfirst question. \"It was the Chinamen who have rebelled.\" With this\r\nhe shut his window.\r\n\r\n\"The Chinamen!\" echoed all in great astonishment. \"That's why not\r\none of them is to be seen!\" \"They've probably killed them all!\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought they were going to do something bad. Yesterday--\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw it myself. Last night--\"\r\n\r\n\"What a pity!\" exclaimed Sister Rufa. \"To get killed just before\r\nChristmas when they bring around their presents! They should have\r\nwaited until New Year's.\"\r\n\r\nLittle by little the street awoke to life. Dogs, chickens, pigs, and\r\ndoves began the movement, and these animals were soon followed by some\r\nragged urchins who held fast to each other's arms as they timidly\r\napproached the barracks. Then a few old women with handkerchiefs\r\ntied about their heads and fastened under their chins appeared with\r\nthick rosaries in their hands, pretending to be at their prayers so\r\nthat the soldiers would let them pass. When it was seen that one\r\nmight walk about without being shot at, the men began to come out\r\nwith assumed airs of indifference. First they limited their steps\r\nto the neighborhood of their houses, caressing their game-cocks,\r\nthen they extended their stroll, stopping from time to time, until\r\nat last they stood in front of the town hall.\r\n\r\nIn a quarter of an hour other versions of the affair were in\r\ncirculation. Ibarra with his servants had tried to kidnap Maria Clara,\r\nand Capitan Tiago had defended her, aided by the Civil Guard. The\r\nnumber of killed was now not fourteen but thirty. Capitan Tiago was\r\nwounded and would leave that very day with his family for Manila.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of two cuadrilleros carrying a human form on a covered\r\nstretcher and followed by a civil-guard produced a great sensation. It\r\nwas conjectured that they came from the convento, and, from the shape\r\nof the feet, which were dangling over one end, some guessed who the\r\ndead man might be, some one else a little distance away told who it\r\nwas; further on the corpse was multiplied and the mystery of the Holy\r\nTrinity duplicated, later the miracle of the loaves and fishes was\r\nrepeated--and the dead were then thirty and eight.\r\n\r\nBy half-past seven, when other guards arrived from neighboring towns,\r\nthe current version was clear and detailed. \"I've just come from the\r\ntown hall, where I've seen Don Filipo and Don Crisostomo prisoners,\" a\r\nman told Sister Puté. \"I've talked with one of the cuadrilleros who are\r\non guard. Well, Bruno, the son of that fellow who was flogged to death,\r\nconfessed everything last night. As you know, Capitan Tiago is going\r\nto marry his daughter to the young Spaniard, so Don Crisostomo in his\r\nrage wanted to get revenge and tried to kill all the Spaniards, even\r\nthe curate. Last night they attacked the barracks and the convento,\r\nbut fortunately, by God's mercy, the curate was in Capitan Tiago's\r\nhouse. They say that a lot of them escaped. The civil-guards burned\r\nDon Crisostomo's house down, and if they hadn't arrested him first\r\nthey would have burned him also.\"\r\n\r\n\"They burned the house down?\"\r\n\r\n\"All the servants are under arrest. Look, you can still see the smoke\r\nfrom here!\" answered the narrator, approaching the window. \"Those\r\nwho come from there tell of many sad things.\"\r\n\r\nAll looked toward the place indicated. A thin column of smoke was\r\nstill slowly rising toward the sky. All made comments, more or less\r\npitying, more or less accusing.\r\n\r\n\"Poor youth!\" exclaimed an old man, Puté's husband.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she answered, \"but look how he didn't order a mass said for\r\nthe soul of his father, who undoubtedly needs it more than others.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, woman, haven't you any pity?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pity for the excommunicated? It's a sin to take pity on the enemies\r\nof God, the curates say. Don't you remember? In the cemetery he walked\r\nabout as if he was in a corral.\"\r\n\r\n\"But a corral and the cemetery are alike,\" replied the old man,\r\n\"only that into the former only one kind of animal enters.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shut up!\" cried Sister Puté. \"You'll still defend those whom God\r\nhas clearly punished. You'll see how they'll arrest you, too. You're\r\nupholding a falling house.\"\r\n\r\nHer husband became silent before this argument.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" continued the old lady, \"after striking Padre Damaso there\r\nwasn't anything left for him to do but to kill Padre Salvi.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you can't deny that he was good when he was a little boy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he was good,\" replied the old woman, \"but he went to Spain. All\r\nthose that go to Spain become heretics, as the curates have said.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oho!\" exclaimed her husband, seeing his chance for a retort, \"and\r\nthe curate, and all the curates, and the Archbishop, and the Pope,\r\nand the Virgin--aren't they from Spain? Are they also heretics? _Abá!_\"\r\n\r\nHappily for Sister Puté the arrival of a maidservant running, all\r\npale and terrified, cut short this discussion.\r\n\r\n\"A man hanged in the next garden!\" she cried breathlessly.\r\n\r\n\"A man hanged?\" exclaimed all in stupefaction. The women crossed\r\nthemselves. No one could move from his place.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" went on the trembling servant; \"I was going to pick\r\npeas--I looked into our neighbor's garden to see if it was--I saw\r\na man swinging--I thought it was Teo, the servant who always gives\r\nme--I went nearer to--pick the peas, and I saw that it wasn't Teo,\r\nbut a dead man. I ran and I ran and--\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's go see him,\" said the old man, rising. \"Show us the way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you go!\" cried Sister Puté, catching hold of his\r\ncamisa. \"Something will happen to you! Is he hanged? Then the worse\r\nfor him!\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me see him, woman. You, Juan, go to the barracks and report\r\nit. Perhaps he's not dead yet.\"\r\n\r\nSo he proceeded to the garden with the servant, who kept behind\r\nhim. The women, including even Sister Puté herself, followed after,\r\nfilled with fear and curiosity.\r\n\r\n\"There he is, sir,\" said the servant, as she stopped and pointed with\r\nher finger.\r\n\r\nThe committee paused at a respectful distance and allowed the old\r\nman to go forward alone.\r\n\r\nA human body hanging from the branch of a santol tree swung about\r\ngently in the breeze. The old man stared at it for a time and saw\r\nthat the legs and arms were stiff, the clothing soiled, and the head\r\ndoubled over.\r\n\r\n\"We mustn't touch him until some officer of the law arrives,\" he said\r\naloud. \"He's already stiff, he's been dead for some time.\"\r\n\r\nThe women gradually moved closer.\r\n\r\n\"He's the fellow who lived in that little house there. He came here\r\ntwo weeks ago. Look at the scar on his face.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Ave Maria!_\" exclaimed some of the women.\r\n\r\n\"Shall we pray for his soul?\" asked a young woman, after she had\r\nfinished staring and examining the body.\r\n\r\n\"Fool, heretic!\" scolded Sister Puté. \"Don't you know what Padre\r\nDamaso said? It's tempting God to pray for one of the damned. Whoever\r\ncommits suicide is irrevocably damned and therefore he isn't buried\r\nin holy ground.\"\r\n\r\nThen she added, \"I knew that this man was coming to a bad end;\r\nI never could find out how he lived.\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw him twice talking with the senior sacristan,\" observed a\r\nyoung woman.\r\n\r\n\"It wouldn't be to confess himself or to order a mass!\"\r\n\r\nOther neighbors came up until a large group surrounded the corpse,\r\nwhich was still swinging about. After half an hour, an alguazil and\r\nthe directorcillo arrived with two cuadrilleros, who took the body\r\ndown and placed it on a stretcher.\r\n\r\n\"People are getting in a hurry to die,\" remarked the directorcillo\r\nwith a smile, as he took a pen from behind his ear.\r\n\r\nHe made captious inquiries, and took down the statement of the\r\nmaidservant, whom he tried to confuse, now looking at her fiercely,\r\nnow threatening her, now attributing to her things that she had not\r\nsaid, so much so that she, thinking that she would have to go to jail,\r\nbegan to cry and wound up by declaring that she wasn't looking for\r\npeas but and she called Teo as a witness.\r\n\r\nWhile this was taking place, a rustic in a wide salakot with a big\r\nbandage on his neck was examining the corpse and the rope. The face\r\nwas not more livid than the rest of the body, two scratches and two\r\nred spots were to be seen above the noose, the strands of the rope were\r\nwhite and had no blood on them. The curious rustic carefully examined\r\nthe camisa and pantaloons, and noticed that they were very dusty and\r\nfreshly torn in some parts. But what most caught his attention were\r\nthe seeds of _amores-secos_ that were sticking on the camisa even up\r\nto the collar.\r\n\r\n\"What are you looking at?\" the directorcillo asked him. \"I was looking,\r\nsir, to see if I could recognize him,\" stammered the rustic, partly\r\nuncovering, but in such a way that his salakot fell lower.\r\n\r\n\"But haven't you heard that it's a certain Lucas? Were you asleep?\"\r\n\r\nThe crowd laughed, while the abashed rustic muttered a few words and\r\nmoved away slowly with his head down.\r\n\r\n\"Here, where you going?\" cried the old man after him.\r\n\r\n\"That's not the way out. That's the way to the dead man's house.\"\r\n\r\n\"The fellow's still asleep,\" remarked the directorcillo\r\nfacetiously. \"Better pour some water over him.\"\r\n\r\nAmid the laughter of the bystanders the rustic left the place where\r\nhe had played such a ridiculous part and went toward the church. In\r\nthe sacristy he asked for the senior sacristan.\r\n\r\n\"He's still asleep,\" was the rough answer. \"Don't you know that the\r\nconvento was assaulted last night?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I'll wait till he wakes up.\" This with a stupid stare at\r\nthe sacristans, such as is common to persons who are used to rough\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nIn a corner which was still in shadow the one-eyed senior sacristan\r\nlay asleep in a big chair. His spectacles were placed on his forehead\r\namid long locks of hair, while his thin, squalid chest, which was bare,\r\nrose and fell regularly.\r\n\r\nThe rustic took a seat near by, as if to wait patiently, but he dropped\r\na piece of money and started to look for it with the aid of a candle\r\nunder the senior sacristan's chair. He noticed seeds of _amores-secos_\r\non the pantaloons and on the cuffs of the sleeper's camisa. The latter\r\nawoke, rubbed his one good eye, and began to scold the rustic with\r\ngreat ill-humor.\r\n\r\n\"I wanted to order a mass, sir,\" was the reply in a tone of excuse.\r\n\r\n\"The masses are already over,\" said the sacristan, sweetening his\r\ntone a little at this. \"If you want it for tomorrow--is it for the\r\nsouls in purgatory?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir,\" answered the rustic, handing him a peso.\r\n\r\nThen gazing fixedly at the single eye, he added, \"It's for a person\r\nwho's going to die soon.\"\r\n\r\nHereupon he left the sacristy. \"I could have caught him last night!\" he\r\nsighed, as he took off the bandage and stood erect to recover the\r\nface and form of Elias.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII\r\n\r\nVae Victis!\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                Mi gozo en un pozo.\r\n\r\n\r\nGuards with forbidding mien paced to and fro in front of the door of\r\nthe town hall, threatening with their rifle-butts the bold urchins who\r\nrose on tiptoe or climbed up on one another to see through the bars.\r\n\r\nThe hall itself did not present that agreeable aspect it wore when\r\nthe program of the fiesta was under discussion--now it was gloomy\r\nand rather ominous. The civil-guards and cuadrilleros who occupied it\r\nscarcely spoke and then with few words in low tones. At the table the\r\ndirectorcillo, two clerks, and several soldiers were rustling papers,\r\nwhile the alferez strode from one side to the other, at times gazing\r\nfiercely toward the door: prouder Themistocles could not have appeared\r\nin the Olympic games after the battle of Salamis. Doña Consolacion\r\nyawned in a corner, exhibiting a dirty mouth and jagged teeth, while\r\nshe fixed her cold, sinister gaze on the door of the jail, which was\r\ncovered with indecent drawings. She had succeeded in persuading her\r\nhusband, whose victory had made him amiable, to let her witness the\r\ninquiry and perhaps the accompanying tortures. The hyena smelt the\r\ncarrion and licked herself, wearied by the delay.\r\n\r\nThe gobernadorcillo was very compunctious. His seat, that large chair\r\nplaced under his Majesty's portrait, was vacant, being apparently\r\nintended for some one else. About nine o'clock the curate arrived,\r\npale and scowling.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you haven't kept yourself waiting!\" the alferez greeted him.\r\n\r\n\"I should prefer not to be present,\" replied Padre Salvi in a low\r\nvoice, paying no heed to the bitter tone of the alferez. \"I'm very\r\nnervous.\"\r\n\r\n\"As no one else has come to fill the place, I judged that your\r\npresence--You know that they leave this afternoon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Young Ibarra and the teniente-mayor?\"\r\n\r\nThe alferez pointed toward the jail. \"There are eight there,\" he\r\nsaid. \"Bruno died at midnight, but his statement is on record.\"\r\n\r\nThe curate saluted Doña Consolacion, who responded with a yawn, and\r\ntook his seat in the big chair under his Majesty's portrait. \"Let us\r\nbegin,\" he announced.\r\n\r\n\"Bring out those two who are in the stocks,\" ordered the alferez in\r\na tone that he tried to make as terrible as possible. Then turning\r\nto the curate he added with a change of tone, \"They are fastened in\r\nby skipping two holes.\"\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of those who are not informed about these\r\ninstruments of torture, we will say that the stocks are one of the\r\nmost harmless. The holes in which the offender's legs are placed\r\nare a little more or less than a foot apart; by skipping two holes,\r\nthe prisoner finds himself in a rather forced position with peculiar\r\ninconvenience to his ankles and a distance of about a yard between\r\nhis lower extremities. It does not kill instantaneously, as may well\r\nbe imagined.\r\n\r\nThe jailer, followed by four soldiers, pushed back the bolt and opened\r\nthe door. A nauseating odor and currents of thick, damp air escaped\r\nfrom the darkness within at the same time that laments and sighs were\r\nheard. A soldier struck a match, but the flame was choked in such a\r\nfoul atmosphere, and they had to wait until the air became fresher.\r\n\r\nIn the dim light of the candle several human forms became vaguely\r\noutlined: men hugging their knees or hiding their heads between them,\r\nsome lying face downward, some standing, and some turned toward the\r\nwall. A blow and a creak were heard, accompanied by curses--the stocks\r\nwere opened, Doña Consolacion bent forward with the muscles of her\r\nneck swelling and her bulging eyes fixed on the half-opened door.\r\n\r\nA wretched figure, Tarsilo, Bruno's brother, came out between two\r\nsoldiers. On his wrists were handcuffs and his clothing was in shreds,\r\nrevealing quite a muscular body. He turned his eyes insolently on\r\nthe alferez's woman.\r\n\r\n\"This is the one who defended himself with the most courage and told\r\nhis companions to run,\" said the alferez to Padre Salvi.\r\n\r\nBehind him came another of miserable aspect, moaning and weeping like a\r\nchild. He limped along exposing pantaloons spotted with blood. \"Mercy,\r\nsir, mercy! I'll not go back into the yard,\" he whimpered.\r\n\r\n\"He's a rogue,\" observed the alferez to the curate. \"He tried to\r\nrun, but he was wounded in the thigh. These are the only two that we\r\ntook alive.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's your name?\" the alferez asked Tarsilo.\r\n\r\n\"Tarsilo Alasigan.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did Don Crisostomo promise you for attacking the barracks?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don Crisostomo never had anything to do with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't deny it! That's why you tried to surprise us.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're mistaken. You beat our father to death and we were avenging\r\nhim, nothing more. Look for your two associates.\"\r\n\r\nThe alferez gazed at the sergeant in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"They're over there in the gully where we threw them yesterday and\r\nwhere they'll rot. Now kill me, you'll not learn anything more.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral surprise and silence, broken by the alferez. \"You are going\r\nto tell who your other accomplices are,\" he threatened, flourishing\r\na rattan whip.\r\n\r\nA smile of disdain curled the prisoner's lips. The alferez consulted\r\nwith the curate in a low tone for a few moments, then turned to the\r\nsoldiers. \"Take him out where the corpses are,\" he commanded.\r\n\r\nOn a cart in a corner of the yard were heaped five corpses, partly\r\ncovered with a filthy piece of torn matting. A soldier walked about\r\nnear them, spitting at every moment.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know them?\" asked the alferez, lifting up the matting.\r\n\r\nTarsilo did not answer. He saw the corpse of the madwoman's husband\r\nwith two others: that of his brother, slashed with bayonet-thrusts,\r\nand that of Lucas with the halter still around his neck. His look\r\nbecame somber and a sigh seemed to escape from his breast.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know them?\" he was again asked, but he still remained silent.\r\n\r\nThe air hissed and the rattan cut his shoulders. He shuddered, his\r\nmuscles contracted. The blows were redoubled, but he remained unmoved.\r\n\r\n\"Whip him until he bursts or talks!\" cried the exasperated alferez.\r\n\r\n\"Talk now,\" the directorcillo advised him. \"They'll kill you anyhow.\"\r\n\r\nThey led him back into the hall where the other prisoner, with\r\nchattering teeth and quaking limbs, was calling upon the saints.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know this fellow?\" asked Padre Salvi.\r\n\r\n\"This is the first time that I've ever seen him,\" replied Tarsilo\r\nwith a look of pity at the other.\r\n\r\nThe alferez struck him with his fist and kicked him. \"Tie him to\r\nthe bench!\"\r\n\r\nWithout taking off the handcuffs, which were covered with blood,\r\nthey tied him to a wooden bench. The wretched boy looked about him\r\nas if seeking something and noticed Doña Consolacion, at sight of\r\nwhom he smiled sardonically. In surprise the bystanders followed his\r\nglance and saw the señora, who was lightly gnawing at her lips.\r\n\r\n\"I've never seen an uglier woman!\" exclaimed Tarsilo in the midst of\r\na general silence. \"I'd rather lie down on a bench as I do now than\r\nat her side as the alferez does.\"\r\n\r\nThe Muse turned pale.\r\n\r\n\"You're going to flog me to death, Señor Alferez,\" he went on,\r\n\"but tonight your woman will revenge me by embracing you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gag him!\" yelled the furious alferez, trembling with wrath.\r\n\r\nTarsilo seemed to have desired the gag, for after it was put in place\r\nhis eyes gleamed with satisfaction. At a signal from the alferez,\r\na guard armed with a rattan whip began his gruesome task. Tarsilo's\r\nwhole body contracted, and a stifled, prolonged cry escaped from\r\nhim in spite of the piece of cloth which covered his mouth. His head\r\ndrooped and his clothes became stained with blood.\r\n\r\nPadre Salvi, pallid and with wandering looks, arose laboriously, made\r\na sign with his hand, and left the hall with faltering steps. In the\r\nstreet he saw a young woman leaning with her shoulders against the\r\nwall, rigid, motionless, listening attentively, staring into space,\r\nher clenched hands stretched out along the wall. The sun beat down\r\nupon her fiercely. She seemed to be breathlessly counting those dry,\r\ndull strokes and those heartrending groans. It was Tarsilo's sister.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the scene in the hall continued. The wretched boy, overcome\r\nwith pain, silently waited for his executioners to become weary. At\r\nlast the panting soldier let his arm fall, and the alferez, pale\r\nwith anger and astonishment, made a sign for them to untie him. Doña\r\nConsolacion then arose and murmured a few words into the ear of her\r\nhusband, who nodded his head in understanding.\r\n\r\n\"To the well with him!\" he ordered.\r\n\r\nThe Filipinos know what this means: in Tagalog they call it\r\n_timbaín_. We do not know who invented this procedure, but we judge\r\nthat it must be quite ancient. Truth at the bottom of a well may\r\nperhaps be a sarcastic interpretation.\r\n\r\nIn the center of the yard rose the picturesque curb of a well,\r\nroughly fashioned from living rock. A rude apparatus of bamboo in\r\nthe form of a well-sweep served for drawing up the thick, slimy,\r\nfoul-smelling water. Broken pieces of pottery, manure, and other\r\nrefuse were collected there, since this well was like the jail,\r\nbeing the place for what society rejected or found useless, and\r\nany object that fell into it, however good it might have been, was\r\nthen a thing lost. Yet it was never closed up, and even at times the\r\nprisoners were condemned to go down and deepen it, not because there\r\nwas any thought of getting anything useful out of such punishment,\r\nbut because of the difficulties the work offered. A prisoner who once\r\nwent down there would contract a fever from which he would surely die.\r\n\r\nTarsilo gazed upon all the preparations of the soldiers with a fixed\r\nlook. He was pale, and his lips trembled or murmured a prayer. The\r\nhaughtiness of his desperation seemed to have disappeared or, at least,\r\nto have weakened. Several times he bent his stiff neck and fixed his\r\ngaze on the ground as though resigned to his sufferings. They led\r\nhim to the well-curb, followed by the smiling Doña Consolacion. In\r\nhis misery he cast a glance of envy toward the heap of corpses and\r\na sigh escaped from his breast.\r\n\r\n\"Talk now,\" the directorcillo again advised him. \"They'll hang you\r\nanyhow. You'll at least die without suffering so much.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll come out of this only to die,\" added a cuadrillero.\r\n\r\nThey took away the gag and hung him up by his feet, for he must go\r\ndown head foremost and remain some time under the water, just as\r\nthe bucket does, only that the man is left a longer time. While the\r\nalferez was gone to look for a watch to count the minutes, Tarsilo\r\nhung with his long hair streaming down and his eyes half closed.\r\n\r\n\"If you are Christians, if you have any heart,\" he begged in a low\r\nvoice, \"let me down quickly or make my head strike against the sides\r\nso that I'll die. God will reward you for this good deed--perhaps\r\nsome day you may be as I am!\"\r\n\r\nThe alferez returned, watch in hand, to superintend the lowering.\r\n\r\n\"Slowly, slowly!\" cried Doña Consolacion, as she kept her gaze fixed\r\non the wretch. \"Be careful!\"\r\n\r\nThe well-sweep moved gently downwards. Tarsilo rubbed against the\r\njutting stones and filthy weeds that grew in the crevices. Then the\r\nsweep stopped while the alferez counted the seconds.\r\n\r\n\"Lift him up!\" he ordered, at the end of a half-minute. The silvery\r\nand harmonious tinkling of the drops of water falling back indicated\r\nthe prisoner's return to the light. Now that the sweep was heavier he\r\nrose rapidly. Pieces of stone and pebbles torn from the walls fell\r\nnoisily. His forehead and hair smeared with filthy slime, his face\r\ncovered with cuts and bruises, his body wet and dripping, he appeared\r\nto the eyes of the silent crowd. The wind made him shiver with cold.\r\n\r\n\"Will you talk?\" he was asked.\r\n\r\n\"Take care of my sister,\" murmured the unhappy boy as he gazed\r\nbeseechingly toward one of the cuadrilleros.\r\n\r\nThe bamboo sweep again creaked, and the condemned boy once more\r\ndisappeared. Doña Consolacion observed that the water remained\r\nquiet. The alferez counted a minute.\r\n\r\nWhen Tarsilo again came up his features were contracted and livid. With\r\nhis bloodshot eyes wide open, he looked at the bystanders.\r\n\r\n\"Are you going to talk?\" the alferez again demanded in dismay.\r\n\r\nTarsilo shook his head, and they again lowered him. His eyelids were\r\nclosing as the pupils continued to stare at the sky where the fleecy\r\nclouds floated; he doubled back his neck so that he might still see\r\nthe light of day, but all too soon he had to go down into the water,\r\nand that foul curtain shut out the sight of the world from him forever.\r\n\r\nA minute passed. The watchful Muse saw large bubbles rise to the\r\nsurface of the water. \"He's thirsty,\" she commented with a laugh. The\r\nwater again became still.\r\n\r\nThis time the alferez did not give the signal for a minute and\r\na half. Tarsilo's features were now no longer contracted. The\r\nhalf-raised lids left the whites of his eyes showing, from his mouth\r\npoured muddy water streaked with blood, but his body did not tremble\r\nin the chill breeze.\r\n\r\nPale and terrified, the silent bystanders gazed at one another. The\r\nalferez made a sign that they should take the body down, and then\r\nmoved away thoughtfully. Doña Consolation applied the lighted end of\r\nher cigar to the bare legs, but the flesh did not twitch and the fire\r\nwas extinguished.\r\n\r\n\"He strangled himself,\" murmured a cuadrillero. \"Look how he turned\r\nhis tongue back as if trying to swallow it.\"\r\n\r\nThe other prisoner, who had watched this scene, sweating and trembling,\r\nnow stared like a lunatic in all directions. The alferez ordered the\r\ndirectorcillo to question him.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, sir,\" he groaned, \"I'll tell everything you want me to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good! Let's see, what's your name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Andong, [144] sir!\"\r\n\r\n\"Bernardo--Leonardo--Ricardo--Eduardo--Gerardo--or what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Andong, sir!\" repeated the imbecile.\r\n\r\n\"Put it down Bernardo, or whatever it may be,\" dictated the alferez.\r\n\r\n\"Surname?\"\r\n\r\nThe man gazed at him in terror.\r\n\r\n\"What name have you that is added to the name Andong?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, sir! Andong the Witless, sir!\"\r\n\r\nThe bystander's could not restrain a smile. Even the alferez paused\r\nin his pacing about.\r\n\r\n\"Occupation?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pruner of coconut trees, sir, and servant of my mother-in-law.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who ordered you to attack the barracks?\"\r\n\r\n\"No one, sir!\"\r\n\r\n\"What, no one? Don't lie about it or into the well you go! Who ordered\r\nyou? Say truly!\"\r\n\r\n\"Truly, sir!\"\r\n\r\n\"Who?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who, sir!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm asking you who ordered you to start the revolution?\"\r\n\r\n\"What revolution, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"This one, for you were in the yard by the barracks last night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, sir!\" exclaimed Andong, blushing.\r\n\r\n\"Who's guilty of that?\"\r\n\r\n\"My mother-in-law, sir!\"\r\n\r\nSurprise and laughter followed these words. The alferez stopped\r\nand stared not unkindly at the wretch, who, thinking that his words\r\nhad produced a good effect, went on with more spirit: \"Yes, sir, my\r\nmother-in-law doesn't give me anything to eat but what is rotten and\r\nunfit, so last night when I came by here with my belly aching I saw\r\nthe yard of the barracks near and I said to myself, 'It's night-time,\r\nno one will see me.' I went in--and then many shots sounded--\"\r\n\r\nA blow from the rattan cut his speech short.\r\n\r\n\"To the jail,\" ordered the alferez. \"This afternoon, to the capital!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVIII\r\n\r\nThe Accursed\r\n\r\n\r\nSoon the news spread through the town that the prisoners were about to\r\nset out. At first it was heard with terror; afterward came the weeping\r\nand wailing. The families of the prisoners ran about in distraction,\r\ngoing from the convento to the barracks, from the barracks to the\r\ntown hall, and finding no consolation anywhere, filled the air with\r\ncries and groans. The curate had shut himself up on a plea of illness;\r\nthe alferez had increased the guards, who received the supplicating\r\nwomen with the butts of their rifles; the gobernadorcillo, at best\r\na useless creature, seemed to be more foolish and more useless than\r\never. In front of the jail the women who still had strength enough\r\nran to and fro, while those who had not sat down on the ground and\r\ncalled upon the names of their beloved.\r\n\r\nAlthough the sun beat down fiercely, not one of these unfortunates\r\nthought of going away. Doray, the erstwhile merry and happy wife of Don\r\nFilipo, wandered about dejectedly, carrying in her arms their infant\r\nson, both weeping. To the advice of friends that she go back home to\r\navoid exposing her baby to an attack of fever, the disconsolate woman\r\nreplied, \"Why should he live, if he isn't going to have a father to\r\nrear him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your husband is innocent. Perhaps he'll come back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, after we're all dead!\"\r\n\r\nCapitana Tinay wept and called upon her son Antonio. The courageous\r\nCapitana Maria gazed silently toward the small grating behind which\r\nwere her twin-boys, her only sons.\r\n\r\nThere was present also the mother-in-law of the pruner of\r\ncoco-palms, but she was not weeping; instead, she paced back and\r\nforth, gesticulating with uplifted arms, and haranguing the crowd:\r\n\"Did you ever see anything like it? To arrest my Andong, to shoot at\r\nhim, to put him in the stocks, to take him to the capital, and only\r\nbecause--because he had a new pair of pantaloons! This calls for\r\nvengeance! The civil-guards are committing abuses! I swear that if\r\nI ever again catch one of them in my garden, as has often happened,\r\nI'll chop him up, I'll chop him up, or else--let him try to chop me\r\nup!\" Few persons, however, joined in the protests of the Mussulmanish\r\nmother-in-law.\r\n\r\n\"Don Crisostomo is to blame for all this,\" sighed a woman.\r\n\r\nThe schoolmaster was also in the crowd, wandering about bewildered. Ñor\r\nJuan did not rub his hands, nor was he carrying his rule and plumb-bob;\r\nhe was dressed in black, for he had heard the bad news and, true\r\nto his habit of looking upon the future as already assured, was in\r\nmourning for Ibarra's death.\r\n\r\nAt two o'clock in the afternoon an open cart drawn by two oxen stopped\r\nin front of the town hall. This was at once set upon by the people,\r\nwho attempted to unhitch the oxen and destroy it. \"Don't do that!\" said\r\nCapitana Maria. \"Do you want to make them walk?\" This consideration\r\nacted as a restraint on the prisoners' relatives.\r\n\r\nTwenty soldiers came out and surrounded the cart; then the prisoners\r\nappeared. The first was Don Filipo, bound. He greeted his wife\r\nsmilingly, but Doray broke out into bitter weeping and two guards had\r\ndifficulty in preventing her from embracing her husband. Antonio, the\r\nson of Capitana Tinay, appeared crying like a baby, which only added to\r\nthe lamentations of his family. The witless Andong broke out into tears\r\nat sight of his mother-in-law, the cause of his misfortune. Albino,\r\nthe quondam theological student, was also bound, as were Capitana\r\nMaria's twins. All three were grave and serious. The last to come\r\nout was Ibarra, unbound, but conducted between two guards. The pallid\r\nyouth looked about him for a friendly face.\r\n\r\n\"He's the one that's to blame!\" cried many voices. \"He's to blame\r\nand he goes loose!\"\r\n\r\n\"My son-in-law hasn't done anything and he's got handcuffs on!\" Ibarra\r\nturned to the guards. \"Bind me, and bind me well, elbow to elbow,\"\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\n\"We haven't any order.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bind me!\" And the soldiers obeyed.\r\n\r\nThe alferez appeared on horseback, armed to the teeth, ten or fifteen\r\nmore soldiers following him.\r\n\r\nEach prisoner had his family there to pray for him, to weep for him,\r\nto bestow on him the most endearing names--all save Ibarra, who had\r\nno one, even Ñor Juan and the schoolmaster having disappeared.\r\n\r\n\"Look what you've done to my husband and my son!\" Doray cried to\r\nhim. \"Look at my poor son! You've robbed him of his father!\"\r\n\r\nSo the sorrow of the families was converted into anger toward the\r\nyoung man, who was accused of having started the trouble. The alferez\r\ngave the order to set out.\r\n\r\n\"You're a coward!\" the mother-in-law of Andong cried after\r\nIbarra. \"While others were fighting for you, you hid yourself, coward!\"\r\n\r\n\"May you be accursed!\" exclaimed an old man, running along beside\r\nhim. \"Accursed be the gold amassed by your family to disturb our\r\npeace! Accursed! Accursed!\"\r\n\r\n\"May they hang you, heretic!\" cried a relative of Albino's. Unable\r\nto restrain himself, he caught up a stone and threw it at the youth.\r\n\r\nThis example was quickly followed, and a rain of dirt and stones fell\r\non the wretched young man. Without anger or complaint, impassively he\r\nbore the righteous vengeance of so many suffering hearts. This was the\r\nparting, the farewell, offered to him by the people among whom were\r\nall his affections. With bowed head, he was perhaps thinking of a man\r\nwhipped through the streets of Manila, of an old woman falling dead\r\nat the sight of her son's head; perhaps Elias's history was passing\r\nbefore his eyes.\r\n\r\nThe alferez found it necessary to drive the crowd back, but the\r\nstone-throwing and the insults did not cease. One mother alone did not\r\nwreak vengeance on him for her sorrows, Capitana Maria. Motionless,\r\nwith lips contracted and eyes full of silent tears, she saw her two\r\nsons move away; her firmness, her dumb grief surpassed that of the\r\nfabled Niobe.\r\n\r\nSo the procession moved on. Of the persons who appeared at the\r\nfew open windows those who showed most pity for the youth were the\r\nindifferent and the curious. All his friends had hidden themselves,\r\neven Capitan Basilio himself, who forbade his daughter Sinang to weep.\r\n\r\nIbarra saw the smoking ruins of his house--the home of his fathers,\r\nwhere he was born, where clustered the fondest recollections of his\r\nchildhood and his youth. Tears long repressed started into his eyes,\r\nand he bowed his head and wept without having the consolation of being\r\nable to hide his grief, tied as he was, nor of having any one in whom\r\nhis sorrow awoke compassion. Now he had neither country, nor home,\r\nnor love, nor friends, nor future!\r\n\r\nFrom a slight elevation a man gazed upon the sad procession. He was an\r\nold man, pale and emaciated, wrapped in a woolen blanket, supporting\r\nhimself with difficulty on a staff. It was the old Sage, Tasio, who,\r\non hearing of the event, had left his bed to be present, but his\r\nstrength had not been sufficient to carry him to the town hall. The\r\nold man followed the cart with his gaze until it disappeared in the\r\ndistance and then remained for some time afterward with his head bowed,\r\ndeep in thought. Then he stood up and laboriously made his way toward\r\nhis house, pausing to rest at every step. On the following day some\r\nherdsmen found him dead on the very threshold of his solitary home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIX\r\n\r\nPatriotism and Private Interests\r\n\r\n\r\nSecretly the telegraph transmitted the report to Manila, and thirty-six\r\nhours later the newspapers commented on it with great mystery and not\r\na few dark hints--augmented, corrected, or mutilated by the censor. In\r\nthe meantime, private reports, emanating from the convents, were the\r\nfirst to gain secret currency from mouth to mouth, to the great terror\r\nof those who heard them. The fact, distorted in a thousand ways,\r\nwas believed with greater or less ease according to whether it was\r\nflattering or worked contrary to the passions and ways of thinking\r\nof each hearer.\r\n\r\nWithout public tranquillity seeming disturbed, at least outwardly,\r\nyet the peace of mind of each home was whirled about like the water in\r\na pond: while the surface appears smooth and clear, in the depths the\r\nsilent fishes swarm, dive about, and chase one another. For one part\r\nof the population crosses, decorations, epaulets, offices, prestige,\r\npower, importance, dignities began to whirl about like butterflies\r\nin a golden atmosphere. For the other part a dark cloud arose on the\r\nhorizon, projecting from its gray depths, like black silhouettes,\r\nbars, chains, and even the fateful gibbet. In the air there seemed to\r\nbe heard investigations, condemnations, and the cries from the torture\r\nchamber; Marianas [145] and Bagumbayan presented themselves wrapped\r\nin a torn and bloody veil, fishers and fished confused. Fate pictured\r\nthe event to the imaginations of the Manilans like certain Chinese\r\nfans--one side painted black, the other gilded with bright-colored\r\nbirds and flowers.\r\n\r\nIn the convents the greatest excitement prevailed. Carriages\r\nwere harnessed, the Provincials exchanged visits and held secret\r\nconferences; they presented themselves in the palaces to offer their\r\naid to _the government in its perilous crisis_. Again there was talk\r\nof comets and omens.\r\n\r\n\"_A Te Deum! A Te Deum!_\" cried a friar in one convent. \"This time\r\nlet no one be absent from the chorus! It's no small mercy from God\r\nto make it clear just now, especially in these hopeless times, how\r\nmuch we are worth!\"\r\n\r\n\"The little general _Mal-Aguero_ [146] can gnaw his lips over this\r\nlesson,\" responded another.\r\n\r\n\"What would have become of him if not for the religious corporations?\"\r\n\r\n\"And to celebrate the fiesta better, serve notice on the cook and\r\nthe refectioner. _Gaudeamus_ for three days!\"\r\n\r\n\"Amen!\" \"Viva Salvi!\" \"Amen!\"\r\n\r\nIn another convent they talked differently.\r\n\r\n\"You see, now, that fellow is a pupil of the Jesuits. The filibusters\r\ncome from the Ateneo.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the anti-friars.\"\r\n\r\n\"I told you so. The Jesuits are ruining the country, they're corrupting\r\nthe youth, but they are tolerated because they trace a few scrawls\r\non a piece of paper when there is an earthquake.\"\r\n\r\n\"And God knows how they are made!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but don't contradict them. When everything is shaking and moving\r\nabout, who draws diagrams? Nothing, Padre Secchi--\" [147]\r\n\r\nAnd they smiled with sovereign disdain.\r\n\r\n\"But what about the weather forecasts and the typhoons?\" asked another\r\nironically. \"Aren't they divine?\"\r\n\r\n\"Any fisherman foretells them!\"\r\n\r\n\"When he who governs is a fool--tell me how your head is and I'll\r\ntell you how your foot is! But you'll see if the friends favor one\r\nanother. The newspapers very nearly ask a miter for Padre Salvi.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's going to get it! He'll lick it right up!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not! Nowadays they grant one for anything whatsoever. I know\r\nof a fellow who got one for less. He wrote a cheap little work\r\ndemonstrating that the Indians are not capable of being anything but\r\nmechanics. Pshaw, old-fogyisms!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right! So much favoritism injures Religion!\" exclaimed\r\nanother. \"If the miters only had eyes and could see what heads they\r\nwere upon--\"\r\n\r\n\"If the miters were natural objects,\" added another in a nasal tone,\r\n\"_Natura abhorrer vacuum_.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's why they grab for them, their emptiness attracts!\" responded\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nThese and many more things were said in the convents, but we will\r\nspare our reader other comments of a political, metaphysical, or\r\npiquant nature and conduct him to a private house. As we have few\r\nacquaintances in Manila, let us enter the home of Capitan Tinong,\r\nthe polite individual whom we saw so profusely inviting Ibarra to\r\nhonor him with a visit.\r\n\r\nIn the rich and spacious sala of his Tondo house, Capitan Tinong was\r\nseated in a wide armchair, rubbing his hands in a gesture of despair\r\nover his face and the nape of his neck, while his wife, Capitana\r\nTinchang, was weeping and preaching to him. From the corner their\r\ntwo daughters listened silently and stupidly, yet greatly affected.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, Virgin of Antipolo!\" cried the woman. \"Ay, Virgin of the Rosary\r\nand of the Girdle! [148] Ay, ay! Our Lady of Novaliches!\"\r\n\r\n\"Mother!\" responded the elder of the daughters.\r\n\r\n\"I told you so!\" continued the wife in an accusing tone. \"I told you\r\nso! Ay, Virgin of Carmen, [149] ay!\"\r\n\r\n\"But you didn't tell me anything,\" Capitan Tinong dared to answer\r\ntearfully. \"On the contrary, you told me that I was doing well to\r\nfrequent Capitan Tiago's house and cultivate friendship with him,\r\nbecause he's rich--and you told me--\"\r\n\r\n\"What! What did I tell you? I didn't tell you that, I didn't tell\r\nyou anything! Ay, if you had only listened to me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Now you're throwing the blame on _me_,\" he replied bitterly, slapping\r\nthe arm of his chair. \"Didn't you tell me that I had done well to\r\ninvite him to dine with us, because he was wealthy? Didn't you say\r\nthat we ought to have friends only among the wealthy? _Abá!_\"\r\n\r\n\"It's true that I told you so, because--because there wasn't anything\r\nelse for me to do. You did nothing but sing his praises: _Don Ibarra_\r\nhere, _Don Ibarra_ there, _Don Ibarra_ everywhere. _Abaá!_ But I\r\ndidn't advise you to hunt him up and talk to him at that reception! You\r\ncan't deny that!\"\r\n\r\n\"Did I know that he was to be there, perhaps?\"\r\n\r\n\"But you ought to have known it!\"\r\n\r\n\"How so, if I didn't even know him?\"\r\n\r\n\"But you ought to have known him!\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Tinchang, it was the first time that I ever saw him, that I\r\never heard him spoken of!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well then, you ought to have known him before and heard him spoken\r\nof. That's what you're a man for and wear trousers and read _El Diario\r\nde Manila_,\" [150] answered his unterrified spouse, casting on him\r\na terrible look.\r\n\r\nTo this Capitan Tinong did not know what to reply. Capitana Tinchang,\r\nhowever, was not satisfied with this victory, but wished to silence him\r\ncompletely. So she approached him with clenched fists. \"Is this what\r\nI've worked for, year after year, toiling and saving, that you by your\r\nstupidity may throw away the fruits of my labor?\" she scolded. \"Now\r\nthey'll come to deport you, they'll take away all our property, just\r\nas they did from the wife of--Oh, if I were a man, if I were a man!\"\r\n\r\nSeeing that her husband bowed his head, she again fell to sobbing,\r\nbut still repeating, \"Ay, if I were a man, if I were a man!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if you were a man,\" the provoked husband at length asked,\r\n\"what would you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"What would I do? Well--well--well, this very minute I'd go to the\r\nCaptain-General and offer to fight against the rebels, this very\r\nminute!\"\r\n\r\n\"But haven't you seen what the _Diario_ says? Read it: 'The vile\r\nand infamous treason has been suppressed with energy, strength, and\r\nvigor, and soon the rebellious enemies of the Fatherland and their\r\naccomplices will feel all the weight and severity of the law.' Don't\r\nyou see it? There isn't any more rebellion.\"\r\n\r\n\"That doesn't matter! You ought to offer yourself as they did in '72;\r\n[151] they saved themselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that's what was done by Padre Burg--\"\r\n\r\nBut he was unable to finish this name, for his wife ran to him and\r\nslapped her hand over his mouth. \"Shut up! Are you saying that name\r\nso that they may garrote you tomorrow on Bagumbayan? Don't you know\r\nthat to pronounce it is enough to get yourself condemned without\r\ntrial? Keep quiet!\"\r\n\r\nHowever Capitan Tinong may have felt about obeying her, he could\r\nhardly have done otherwise, for she had his mouth covered with both\r\nher hands, pressing his little head against the back of the chair,\r\nso that the poor fellow might have been smothered to death had not\r\na new personage appeared on the scene. This was their cousin, Don\r\nPrimitivo, who had memorized the \"Amat,\" a man of some forty years,\r\nplump, big-paunched, and elegantly dressed.\r\n\r\n\"_Quid video?_\" he exclaimed as he entered. \"What's\r\nhappening? _Quare?_\" [152]\r\n\r\n\"Ay, cousin!\" cried the woman, running toward him in tears, \"I've\r\nsent for you because I don't know what's going to become of us. What\r\ndo you advise? Speak, you've studied Latin and know how to argue.\"\r\n\r\n\"But first, _quid quaeritis? Nihil est in intellectu quod prius non\r\nfuerit in sensu; nihil volitum quin praecognitum_.\" [153]\r\n\r\nHe sat down gravely and, just as if the Latin phrases had possessed\r\na soothing virtue, the couple ceased weeping and drew nearer to him\r\nto hang upon the advice from his lips, as at one time the Greeks did\r\nbefore the words of salvation from the oracle that was to free them\r\nfrom the Persian invaders.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you weep? _Ubinam gentium sumus?_\" [154]\r\n\r\n\"You've already heard of the uprising?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Alzamentum Ibarrae ab alferesio Guardiae Civilis destructum? Et\r\nnunc?_ [155] What! Does Don Crisostomo owe you anything?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but you know, Tinong invited him to dinner and spoke to him\r\non the Bridge of Spain--in broad daylight! They'll say that he's a\r\nfriend of his!\"\r\n\r\n\"A friend of his!\" exclaimed the startled Latinist, rising. \"_Amice,\r\namicus Plato sed magis amica veritas_. Birds of a feather flock\r\ntogether. _Malum est negotium et est timendum rerum istarum\r\nhorrendissimum resultatum!_ [156] Ahem!\"\r\n\r\nCapitan Tinong turned deathly pale at hearing so many words in _um_;\r\nsuch a sound presaged ill. His wife clasped her hands supplicatingly\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\"Cousin, don't talk to us in Latin now. You know that we're not\r\nphilosophers like you. Let's talk in Spanish or Tagalog. Give us\r\nsome advice.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a pity that you don't understand Latin, cousin. Truths in\r\nLatin are lies in Tagalog; for example, _contra principia negantem\r\nfustibus est arguendum_ [157] in Latin is a truth like Noah's ark,\r\nbut I put it into practise once and I was the one who got whipped. So,\r\nit's a pity that you don't know Latin. In Latin everything would be\r\nstraightened out.\"\r\n\r\n\"We, too, know many _oremus, parcenobis_, and _Agnus Dei Catolis_,\r\n[158] but now we shouldn't understand one another. Provide Tinong\r\nwith an argument so that they won't hang him!\"\r\n\r\n\"You're done wrong, very wrong, cousin, in cultivating friendship\r\nwith that young man,\" replied the Latinist.\r\n\r\n\"The righteous suffer for the sinners. I was almost going to advise you\r\nto make your will. _Vae illis! Ubi est fumus ibi est ignis! Similis\r\nsimili audet; atqui Ibarra ahorcatur, ergo ahorcaberis--_\" [159]\r\nWith this he shook his head from side to side disgustedly.\r\n\r\n\"Saturnino, what's the matter?\" cried Capitana Tinchang in dismay. \"Ay,\r\nhe's dead! A doctor! Tinong, Tinongoy!\"\r\n\r\nThe two daughters ran to her, and all three fell to weeping. \"It's\r\nnothing more than a swoon, cousin! I would have been more pleased\r\nthat--that--but unfortunately it's only a swoon. _Non timeo mortem\r\nin catre sed super espaldonem Bagumbayanis_. [160] Get some water!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't die!\" sobbed the wife. \"Don't die, for they'll come and arrest\r\nyou! Ay, if you die and the soldiers come, ay, ay!\"\r\n\r\nThe learned cousin rubbed the victim's face with water until he\r\nrecovered consciousness. \"Come, don't cry. _Inveni remedium_: I've\r\nfound a remedy. Let's carry him to bed. Come, take courage! Here I am\r\nwith you--and all the wisdom of the ancients. Call a doctor, and you,\r\ncousin, go right away to the Captain-General and take him a present--a\r\ngold ring, a chain. _Dadivae quebrantant peñas_. [161] Say that it's\r\na Christmas gift. Close the windows, the doors, and if any one asks\r\nfor my cousin, say that he is seriously ill. Meanwhile, I'll burn all\r\nhis letters, papers, and books, so that they can't find anything,\r\njust as Don Crisostomo did. _Scripti testes sunt! Quod medicamenta\r\nnon sanant, ferrum sanat, quod ferrum non sanat, ignis sanat._\" [162]\r\n\r\n\"Yes, do so, cousin, burn everything!\" said Capitana Tinchang. \"Here\r\nare the keys, here are the letters from Capitan Tiago. Burn them! Don't\r\nleave a single European newspaper, for they're very dangerous. Here\r\nare the copies of _The Times_ that I've kept for wrapping up soap\r\nand old clothes. Here are the books.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go to the Captain-General, cousin,\" said Don Primitivo, \"and leave\r\nus alone. _In extremis extrema_. [163] Give me the authority of a\r\nRoman dictator, and you'll see how soon I'll save the coun--I mean,\r\nmy cousin.\"\r\n\r\nHe began to give orders and more orders, to upset bookcases, to tear\r\nup papers, books, and letters. Soon a big fire was burning in the\r\nkitchen. Old shotguns were smashed with axes, rusty revolvers were\r\nthrown away. The maidservant who wanted to keep the barrel of one\r\nfor a blowpipe received a reprimand:\r\n\r\n\"_Conservare etiam sperasti, perfida?_ [164] Into the fire!\" So\r\nhe continued his auto da fé. Seeing an old volume in vellum,\r\nhe read the title, _Revolutions of the Celestial Globes_,\r\nby Copernicus. Whew! \"_Ite, maledicti, in ignem kalanis!_\"\r\n[165] he exclaimed, hurling it into the flames. \"Revolutions and\r\nCopernicus! Crimes on crimes! If I hadn't come in time! _Liberty in\r\nthe Philippines!_ Ta, ta, ta! What books! Into the fire!\"\r\n\r\nHarmless books, written by simple authors, were burned; not even the\r\nmost innocent work escaped. Cousin Primitivo was right: the righteous\r\nsuffer for the sinners.\r\n\r\nFour or five hours later, at a pretentious reception in the Walled\r\nCity, current events were being commented upon. There were present\r\na lot of old women and maidens of marriageable age, the wives and\r\ndaughters of government employees, dressed in loose gowns, fanning\r\nthemselves and yawning. Among the men, who, like the women, showed\r\nin their faces their education and origin, was an elderly gentleman,\r\nsmall and one-armed, whom the others treated with great respect. He\r\nhimself maintained a disdainful silence.\r\n\r\n\"To tell the truth, formerly I couldn't endure the friars and the\r\ncivil-guards, they're so rude,\" said a corpulent dame, \"but now that\r\nI see their usefulness and their services, I would almost marry any\r\none of them gladly. I'm a patriot.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what I say!\" added a thin lady. \"What a pity that we haven't\r\nour former governor. He would leave the country as clean as a platter.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the whole race of filibusters would be exterminated!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't they say that there are still a lot of islands to be\r\npopulated? Why don't they deport all these crazy Indians to them? If\r\nI were the Captain-General--\"\r\n\r\n\"Señoras,\" interrupted the one-armed individual, \"the Captain-General\r\nknows his duty. As I've heard, he's very much irritated, for he had\r\nheaped favors on that Ibarra.\"\r\n\r\n\"Heaped favors on him!\" echoed the thin lady, fanning herself\r\nfuriously. \"Look how ungrateful these Indians are! Is it possible to\r\ntreat them as if they were human beings? _Jesús!_\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know what I've heard?\" asked a military official.\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's hear it!\"\r\n\r\n\"What do they say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Reputable persons,\" replied the officer in the midst of a profound\r\nsilence, \"state that this agitation for building a schoolhouse was\r\na pure fairy tale.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Jesús!_ Just see that!\" the señoras exclaimed, already believing\r\nin the trick.\r\n\r\n\"The school was a pretext. What he wanted to build was a fort from\r\nwhich he could safely defend himself when we should come to attack\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"What infamy! Only an Indian is capable of such cowardly thoughts,\"\r\nexclaimed the fat lady. \"If I were the Captain-General they would\r\nsoon seem they would soon see--\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what I say!\" exclaimed the thin lady, turning to the one-armed\r\nman. \"Arrest all the little lawyers, priestlings, merchants, and\r\nwithout trial banish or deport them! Tear out the evil by the roots!\"\r\n\r\n\"But it's said that this filibuster is the descendant of Spaniards,\"\r\nobserved the one-armed man, without looking at any one in particular.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes!\" exclaimed the fat lady, unterrified. \"It's always the\r\ncreoles! No Indian knows anything about revolution! Rear crows,\r\nrear crows!\" [166]\r\n\r\n\"Do you know what I've heard?\" asked a creole lady, to change the topic\r\nof conversation. \"The wife of Capitan Tinong, you remember her, the\r\nwoman in whose house we danced and dined during the fiesta of Tondo--\"\r\n\r\n\"The one who has two daughters? What about her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that woman just this afternoon presented the Captain-General\r\nwith a ring worth a thousand pesos!\"\r\n\r\nThe one-armed man turned around. \"Is that so? Why?\" he asked with\r\nshining eyes.\r\n\r\n\"She said that it was a Christmas gift--\"\r\n\r\n\"But Christmas doesn't come for a month yet!\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps she's afraid the storm is blowing her way,\" observed the\r\nfat lady.\r\n\r\n\"And is getting under cover,\" added the thin señora.\r\n\r\n\"When no return is asked, it's a confession of guilt.\"\r\n\r\n\"This must be carefully looked into,\" declared the one-armed man\r\nthoughtfully. \"I fear that there's a cat in the bag.\"\r\n\r\n\"A cat in the bag, yes! That's just what I was going to say,\" echoed\r\nthe thin lady.\r\n\r\n\"And so was I,\" said the other, taking the words out of her mouth,\r\n\"the wife of Capitan Tinong is so stingy--she hasn't yet sent us\r\nany present and that after we've been in her house. So, when such\r\na grasping and covetous woman lets go of a little present worth a\r\nthousand pesos--\"\r\n\r\n\"But, is it a fact?\" inquired the one-armed man.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly! Most certainly! My cousin's sweetheart, his Excellency's\r\nadjutant, told her so. And I'm of the opinion that it's the very same\r\nring that the older daughter wore on the day of the fiesta. She's\r\nalways covered with diamonds.\"\r\n\r\n\"A walking show-case!\"\r\n\r\n\"A way of attracting attention, like any other! Instead of buying a\r\nfashion plate or paying a dressmaker--\"\r\n\r\nGiving some pretext, the one-armed man left the gathering. Two hours\r\nlater, when the world slept, various residents of Tondo received an\r\ninvitation through some soldiers. The authorities could not consent\r\nto having certain persons of position and property sleep in such\r\npoorly guarded and badly ventilated houses--in Fort Santiago and\r\nother government buildings their sleep would be calmer and more\r\nrefreshing. Among these favored persons was included the unfortunate\r\nCapitan Tinong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LX\r\n\r\nMaria Clara Weds\r\n\r\n\r\nCapitan Tiago was very happy, for in all this terrible storm no one\r\nhad taken any notice of him. He had not been arrested, nor had he been\r\nsubjected to solitary confinement, investigations, electric machines,\r\ncontinuous foot-baths in underground cells, or other pleasantries that\r\nare well-known to certain folk who call themselves civilized. His\r\nfriends, that is, those who had been his friends--for the good man\r\nhad denied all his Filipino friends from the instant when they were\r\nsuspected by the government--had also returned to their homes after a\r\nfew days' vacation in the state edifices. The Captain-General himself\r\nhad ordered that they be cast out from his precincts, not considering\r\nthem worthy of remaining therein, to the great disgust of the one-armed\r\nindividual, who had hoped to celebrate the approaching Christmas in\r\ntheir abundant and opulent company.\r\n\r\nCapitan Tinong had returned to his home sick, pale, and swollen; the\r\nexcursion had not done him good. He was so changed that he said not\r\na word, nor even greeted his family, who wept, laughed, chattered,\r\nand almost went mad with joy. The poor man no longer ventured out\r\nof his house for fear of running the risk of saying good-day to a\r\nfilibuster. Not even Don Primitivo himself, with all the wisdom of\r\nthe ancients, could draw him out of his silence.\r\n\r\n\"_Crede, prime_,\" the Latinist told him, \"if I hadn't got here to\r\nburn all your papers, they would have squeezed your neck; and if I\r\nhad burned the whole house they wouldn't have touched a hair of your\r\nhead. But _quod_ _eventum, eventum; gratias agamus Domino Deo quia\r\nnon in Marianis Insulis es, camotes seminando_.\" [167]\r\n\r\nStories similar to Capitan Tinong's were not unknown to Capitan Tiago,\r\nso he bubbled over with gratitude, without knowing exactly to whom he\r\nowed such signal favors. Aunt Isabel attributed the miracle to the\r\nVirgin of Antipolo, to the Virgin of the Rosary, or at least to the\r\nVirgin of Carmen, and at the very, very least that she was willing\r\nto concede, to Our Lady of the Girdle; according to her the miracle\r\ncould not get beyond that.\r\n\r\nCapitan Tiago did not deny the miracle, but added: \"I think so, Isabel,\r\nbut the Virgin of Antipolo couldn't have done it alone. My friends\r\nhave helped, my future son-in-law, Señor Linares, who, as you know,\r\njoked with Señor Antonio Canovas himself, the premier whose portrait\r\nappears in the _Ilustración_, he who doesn't condescend to show more\r\nthan half his face to the people.\"\r\n\r\nSo the good man could not repress a smile of satisfaction every\r\ntime that he heard any important news. And there was plenty of news:\r\nit was whispered about in secret that Ibarra would be hanged; that,\r\nwhile many proofs of his guilt had been lacking, at last some one\r\nhad appeared to sustain the accusation; that experts had declared\r\nthat in fact the work on the schoolhouse could pass for a bulwark of\r\nfortification, although somewhat defective, as was only to be expected\r\nof ignorant Indians. These rumors calmed him and made him smile.\r\n\r\nIn the same way that Capitan Tiago and his cousin diverged in\r\ntheir opinions, the friends of the family were also divided into\r\ntwo parties,--one miraculous, the other governmental, although this\r\nlatter was insignificant. The miraculous party was again subdivided:\r\nthe senior sacristan of Binondo, the candle-woman, and the leader\r\nof the Brotherhood saw the hand of God directed by the Virgin of the\r\nRosary; while the Chinese wax-chandler, his caterer on his visits to\r\nAntipolo, said, as he fanned himself and shook his leg:\r\n\r\n\"Don't fool yourself--it's the Virgin of Antipolo! She can do more\r\nthan all the rest--don't fool yourself!\" [168]\r\n\r\nCapitan Tiago had great respect for this Chinese, who passed himself\r\noff as a prophet and a physician. Examining the palm of the deceased\r\nlady just before her daughter was born, he had prognosticated:\r\n\"If it's not a boy and doesn't die, it'll be a fine girl!\" [169] and\r\nMaria Clara had come into the world to fulfill the infidel's prophecy.\r\n\r\nCapitan Tiago, then, as a prudent and cautious man, could not decide\r\nso easily as Trojan Paris--he could not so lightly give the preference\r\nto one Virgin for fear of offending another, a situation that might be\r\nfraught with grave consequences. \"Prudence!\" he said to himself. \"Let's\r\nnot go and spoil it all now.\"\r\n\r\nHe was still in the midst of these doubts when the governmental party\r\narrived,--Doña Victorina, Don Tiburcio, and Linares. Doña Victorina did\r\nthe talking for the three men as well as for herself. She mentioned\r\nLinares' visits to the Captain-General and repeatedly insinuated\r\nthe advantages of a relative of \"quality.\" \"Now,\" she concluded,\r\n\"as we was zaying: he who zhelterz himzelf well, builds a good roof.\"\r\n\r\n\"T-the other w-way, w-woman!\" corrected the doctor.\r\n\r\nFor some days now she had been endeavoring to _Andalusize_ her speech,\r\nand no one had been able to get this idea out of her head--she would\r\nsooner have first let them tear off her false frizzes.\r\n\r\n\"Yez,\" she went on, speaking of Ibarra, \"he deserves it all. I told\r\nyou zo when I first zaw him, he's a filibuzter. What did the General\r\nzay to you, cousin? What did he zay? What news did he tell you about\r\nthiz Ibarra?\"\r\n\r\nSeeing that her cousin was slow in answering, she continued, directing\r\nher remarks to Capitan Tiago, \"Believe me, if they zentenz him to\r\ndeath, as is to be hoped, it'll be on account of my cousin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Señora, señora!\" protested Linares.\r\n\r\nBut she gave him no time for objections. \"How diplomatic you have\r\nbecome! We know that you're the adviser of the General, that he\r\ncouldn't live without you. Ah, Clarita, what a pleasure to zee you!\"\r\n\r\nMaria Clara was still pale, although now quite recovered from her\r\nillness. Her long hair was tied up with a light blue silk ribbon. With\r\na timid bow and a sad smile she went up to Doña Victorina for the\r\nceremonial kiss.\r\n\r\nAfter the usual conventional remarks, the pseudo-Andalusian continued:\r\n\"We've come to visit you. You've been zaved, thankz to your\r\nrelations.\" This was said with a significant glance toward Linares.\r\n\r\n\"God has protected my father,\" replied the girl in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\"Yez, Clarita, but the time of the miracles is pazt. We Zpaniards zay:\r\n'Truzt in the Virgin and take to your heels.'\"\r\n\r\n\"T-the other w-way!\"\r\n\r\nCapitan Tiago, who had up to this point had no chance to speak, now\r\nmade bold enough to ask, while he threw himself into an attitude of\r\nstrict attention, \"So you, Doña Victorina, think that the Virgin--\"\r\n\r\n\"We've come ezpezially to talk with you about the virgin,\" she answered\r\nmysteriously, making a sign toward Maria Clara. \"We've come to talk\r\nbusiness.\"\r\n\r\nThe maiden understood that she was expected to retire, so with an\r\nexcuse she went away, supporting herself on the furniture.\r\n\r\nWhat was said and what was agreed upon in this conference was so\r\nsordid and mean that we prefer not to recount it. It is enough to\r\nrecord that as they took their leave they were all merry, and that\r\nafterwards Capitan Tiago said to Aunt Isabel:\r\n\r\n\"Notify the restaurant that we'll have a fiesta tomorrow. Get Maria\r\nready, for we're going to marry her off before long.\"\r\n\r\nAunt Isabel stared at him in consternation.\r\n\r\n\"You'll see! When Señor Linares is our son-in-law we'll get into all\r\nthe palaces. Every one will envy us, every one will die of envy!\"\r\n\r\nThus it happened that at eight o'clock on the following evening\r\nthe house of Capitan Tiago was once again filled, but this time his\r\nguests were only Spaniards and Chinese. The fair sex was represented\r\nby Peninsular and Philippine-Spanish ladies.\r\n\r\nThere were present the greater part of our acquaintances: Padre Sibyla\r\nand Padre Salvi among various Franciscans and Dominicans; the old\r\nlieutenant of the Civil Guard, Señor Guevara, gloomier than ever;\r\nthe alferez, who was for the thousandth time describing his battle\r\nand gazing over his shoulders at every one, believing himself to\r\nbe a Don John of Austria, for he was now a major; De Espadaña, who\r\nlooked at the alferez with respect and fear, and avoided his gaze;\r\nand Doña Victorina, swelling with indignation. Linares had not yet\r\ncome; as a personage of importance, he had to arrive later than the\r\nothers. There are creatures so simple that by being an hour behind\r\ntime they transform themselves into great men.\r\n\r\nIn the group of women Maria Clara was the subject of a murmured\r\nconversation. The maiden had welcomed them all ceremoniously, without\r\nlosing her air of sadness.\r\n\r\n\"Pish!\" remarked one young woman. \"The proud little thing!\"\r\n\r\n\"Pretty little thing!\" responded another. \"But he might have picked\r\nout some other girl with a less foolish face.\"\r\n\r\n\"The gold, child! The good youth is selling himself.\"\r\n\r\nIn another part the comments ran thus:\r\n\r\n\"To get married when her first fiancé is about to be hanged!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what's called prudence, having a substitute ready.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, when she gets to be a widow--\"\r\n\r\nMaria Clara was seated in a chair arranging a salver of flowers and\r\ndoubtless heard all these remarks, for her hand trembled, she turned\r\npale, and several times bit her lips.\r\n\r\nIn the circle of men the conversation was carried on in loud tones\r\nand, naturally, turned upon recent events. All were talking, even\r\nDon Tiburcio, with the exception of Padre Sibyla, who maintained his\r\nusual disdainful silence.\r\n\r\n\"I've heard it said that your Reverence is leaving the town, Padre\r\nSalvi?\" inquired the new major, whose fresh star had made him more\r\namiable.\r\n\r\n\"I have nothing more to do there. I'm going to stay permanently in\r\nManila. And you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm also leaving the town,\" answered the ex-alferez, swelling up. \"The\r\ngovernment needs me to command a flying column to clean the provinces\r\nof filibusters.\"\r\n\r\nFray Sibyla looked him over rapidly from head to foot and then turned\r\nhis back completely.\r\n\r\n\"Is it known for certain what will become of the ringleader, the\r\nfilibuster?\" inquired a government employee.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean Crisostomo Ibarra?\" asked another. \"The most likely and\r\nmost just thing is that he will be hanged, like those of '72.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's going to be deported,\" remarked the old lieutenant, dryly.\r\n\r\n\"Deported! Nothing more than deported? But it will be a perpetual\r\ndeportation!\" exclaimed several voices at the same time.\r\n\r\n\"If that young man,\" continued the lieutenant, Guevara, in a loud\r\nand severe tone, \"had been more cautious, if he had confided less\r\nin certain persons with whom he corresponded, if our prosecutors did\r\nnot know how to interpret so subtly what is written, that young man\r\nwould surely have been acquitted.\"\r\n\r\nThis declaration on the part of the old lieutenant and the tone\r\nof his voice produced great surprise among his hearers, who were\r\napparently at a loss to know what to say. Padre Salvi stared in\r\nanother direction, perhaps to avoid the gloomy look that the old\r\nsoldier turned on him. Maria Clara let her flowers fall and remained\r\nmotionless. Padre Sibyla, who knew so well how to be silent, seemed\r\nalso to be the only one who knew how to ask a question.\r\n\r\n\"You're speaking of letters, Señor Guevara?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm speaking of what was told me by his lawyer, who looked after the\r\ncase with interest and zeal. Outside of some ambiguous lines which this\r\nyouth wrote to a woman before he left for Europe, lines in which the\r\ngovernment's attorney saw a plot and a threat against the government,\r\nand which he acknowledged to be his, there wasn't anything found to\r\naccuse him of.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the declaration of the outlaw before he died?\"\r\n\r\n\"His lawyer had that thrown out because, according to the outlaw\r\nhimself, they had never communicated with the young man, but with\r\na certain Lucas, who was an enemy of his, as could be proved, and\r\nwho committed suicide, perhaps from remorse. It was proved that the\r\npapers found on the corpse were forged, since the handwriting was\r\nlike that of Señor Ibarra's seven years ago, but not like his now,\r\nwhich leads to the belief that the model for them may have been that\r\nincriminating letter. Besides, the lawyer says that if Señor Ibarra\r\nhad refused to acknowledge the letter, he might have been able to\r\ndo a great deal for him--but at sight of the letter he turned pale,\r\nlost his courage, and confirmed everything written in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you say that the letter was directed to a woman?\" asked a\r\nFranciscan. \"How did it get into the hands of the prosecutor?\"\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant did not answer. He stared for a moment at Padre Salvi\r\nand then moved away, nervously twisting the sharp point of his gray\r\nbeard. The others made their comments.\r\n\r\n\"There is seen the hand of God!\" remarked one. \"Even the women\r\nhate him.\"\r\n\r\n\"He had his house burned down, thinking in that way to save himself,\r\nbut he didn't count on the guest, on his _querida_, his _babaye_,\"\r\nadded another, laughing. \"It's the work of God! _Santiago y cierra\r\nEspaña!_\" [170]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the old soldier paused in his pacing about and approached\r\nMaria Clara, who was listening to the conversation, motionless in\r\nher chair, with the flowers scattered at her feet.\r\n\r\n\"You are a very prudent girl,\" the old officer whispered to her. \"You\r\ndid well to give up the letter. You have thus assured yourself an\r\nuntroubled future.\"\r\n\r\nWith startled eyes she watched him move away from her, and bit her\r\nlip. Fortunately, Aunt Isabel came along, and she had sufficient\r\nstrength left to catch hold of the old lady's skirt.\r\n\r\n\"Aunt!\" she murmured.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\" asked the old lady, frightened by the look on\r\nthe girl's face.\r\n\r\n\"Take me to my room!\" she pleaded, grasping her aunt's arm in order\r\nto rise.\r\n\r\n\"Are you sick, daughter? You look as if you'd lost your bones! What's\r\nthe matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"A fainting spell--the people in the room--so many lights--I need to\r\nrest. Tell father that I'm going to sleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're cold. Do you want some tea?\"\r\n\r\nMaria Clara shook her head, entered and locked the door of her\r\nchamber, and then, her strength failing her, she fell sobbing to the\r\nfloor at the feet of an image.\r\n\r\n\"Mother, mother, mother mine!\" she sobbed.\r\n\r\nThrough the window and a door that opened on the azotea the moonlight\r\nentered. The musicians continued to play merry waltzes, laughter\r\nand the hum of voices penetrated into the chamber, several times her\r\nfather, Aunt Isabel, Doña Victorina, and even Linares knocked at the\r\ndoor, but Maria did not move. Heavy sobs shook her breast.\r\n\r\nHours passed--the pleasures of the dinner-table ended, the sound of\r\nsinging and dancing was heard, the candle burned itself out, but the\r\nmaiden still remained motionless on the moonlit floor at the feet of\r\nan image of the Mother of Jesus.\r\n\r\nGradually the house became quiet again, the lights were extinguished,\r\nand Aunt Isabel once more knocked at the door.\r\n\r\n\"Well, she's gone to sleep,\" said the old woman, aloud. \"As she's\r\nyoung and has no cares, she sleeps like a corpse.\"\r\n\r\nWhen all was silence she raised herself slowly and threw a look about\r\nher. She saw the azotea with its little arbors bathed in the ghostly\r\nlight of the moon.\r\n\r\n\"An untroubled future! She sleeps like a corpse!\" she repeated in a\r\nlow voice as she made her way out to the azotea.\r\n\r\nThe city slept. Only from time to time there was heard the noise of a\r\ncarriage crossing the wooden bridge over the river, whose undisturbed\r\nwaters reflected smoothly the light of the moon. The young woman\r\nraised her eyes toward a sky as clear as sapphire. Slowly she took\r\nthe rings from her fingers and from her ears and removed the combs\r\nfrom her hair. Placing them on the balustrade of the azotea, she\r\ngazed toward the river.\r\n\r\nA small banka loaded with zacate stopped at the foot of the landing\r\nsuch as every house on the bank of the river has. One of two men who\r\nwere in it ran up the stone stairway and jumped over the wall, and a\r\nfew seconds later his footsteps were heard on the stairs leading to\r\nthe azotea.\r\n\r\nMaria Clara saw him pause on discovering her, but only for a\r\nmoment. Then he advanced slowly and stopped within a few paces of\r\nher. Maria Clara recoiled.\r\n\r\n\"Crisostomo!\" she murmured, overcome with fright.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am Crisostomo,\" replied the young man gravely. \"An enemy,\r\na man who has every reason for hating me, Elias, has rescued me from\r\nthe prison into which my friends threw me.\"\r\n\r\nA sad silence followed these words. Maria Clara bowed her head and\r\nlet her arms fall.\r\n\r\nIbarra went on: \"Beside my mother's corpse I swore that I would make\r\nyou happy, whatever might be my destiny! You can have been faithless\r\nto your oath, for she was not your mother; but I, I who am her son,\r\nhold her memory so sacred that in spite of a thousand difficulties I\r\nhave come here to carry mine out, and fate has willed that I should\r\nspeak to you yourself. Maria, we shall never see each other again--you\r\nare young and perhaps some day your conscience may reproach you--I have\r\ncome to tell you, before I go away forever, that I forgive you. Now,\r\nmay you be happy and--farewell!\"\r\n\r\nIbarra started to move away, but the girl stopped him.\r\n\r\n\"Crisostomo,\" she said, \"God has sent you to save me from\r\ndesperation. Hear me and then judge me!\"\r\n\r\nIbarra tried gently to draw away from her. \"I didn't come to call\r\nyou to account! I came to give you peace!\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want that peace which you bring me. Peace I will give\r\nmyself. You despise me and your contempt will embitter all the rest\r\nof my life.\"\r\n\r\nIbarra read the despair and sorrow depicted in the suffering girl's\r\nface and asked her what she wished.\r\n\r\n\"That you believe that I have always loved you!\"\r\n\r\nAt this he smiled bitterly.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you doubt me! You doubt the friend of your childhood, who\r\nhas never hidden a single thought from you!\" the maiden exclaimed\r\nsorrowfully. \"I understand now! But when you hear my story, the sad\r\nstory that was revealed to me during my illness, you will have mercy\r\non me, you will not have that smile for my sorrow. Why did you not\r\nlet me die in the hands of my ignorant physician? You and I both\r\nwould have been happier!\"\r\n\r\nResting a moment, she then went on: \"You have desired it, you have\r\ndoubted me! But may my mother forgive me! On one of the sorrowfulest\r\nof my nights of suffering, a man revealed to me the name of my real\r\nfather and forbade me to love you--except that my father himself\r\nshould pardon the injury you had done him.\"\r\n\r\nIbarra recoiled a pace and gazed fearfully at her.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she continued, \"that man told me that he could not permit our\r\nunion, since his conscience would forbid it, and that he would be\r\nobliged to reveal the name of my real father at the risk of causing a\r\ngreat scandal, for my father is--\" And she murmured into the youth's\r\near a name in so low a tone that only he could have heard it.\r\n\r\n\"What was I to do? Must I sacrifice to my love the memory of my\r\nmother, the honor of my supposed father, and the good name of the\r\nreal one? Could I have done that without having even you despise me?\"\r\n\r\n\"But the proof! Had you any proof? You needed proofs!\" exclaimed\r\nIbarra, trembling with emotion.\r\n\r\nThe maiden snatched two papers from her bosom.\r\n\r\n\"Two letters of my mother's, two letters written in the midst of her\r\nremorse, while I was yet unborn! Take them, read them, and you will\r\nsee how she cursed me and wished for my death, which my father vainly\r\ntried to bring about with drugs. These letters he had forgotten in a\r\nbuilding where he had lived; the other man found and preserved them\r\nand only gave them up to me in exchange for your letter, in order\r\nto assure himself, so he said, that I would not marry you without\r\nthe consent of my father. Since I have been carrying them about with\r\nme, in place of your letter, I have, felt the chill in my heart. I\r\nsacrificed you, I sacrificed my love! What else could one do for a\r\ndead mother and two living fathers? Could I have suspected the use\r\nthat was to be made of your letter?\"\r\n\r\nIbarra stood appalled, while she continued: \"What more was left for me\r\nto do? Could I perhaps tell you who my father was, could I tell you\r\nthat you should beg forgiveness of him who made your father suffer\r\nso much? Could I ask my father that he forgive you, could I tell him\r\nthat I knew that I was his daughter--him, who desired my death so\r\neagerly? It was only left to me to suffer, to guard the secret, and\r\nto die suffering! Now, my friend, now that you know the sad history\r\nof your poor Maria, will you still have for her that disdainful smile?\"\r\n\r\n\"Maria, you are an angel!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I am happy, since you believe me--\"\r\n\r\n\"But yet,\" added the youth with a change of tone, \"I've heard that\r\nyou are going to be married.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" sobbed the girl, \"my father demands this sacrifice. He has\r\nloved me and cared for me when it was not his duty to do so, and I\r\nwill pay this debt of gratitude to assure his peace, by means of this\r\nnew relationship, but--\"\r\n\r\n\"But what?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will never forget the vows of faithfulness that I have made to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you thinking of doing?\" asked Ibarra, trying to read the\r\nlook in her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"The future is dark and my destiny is wrapped in gloom! I don't know\r\nwhat I should do. But know, that I have loved but once and that without\r\nlove I will never belong to any man. And you, what is going to become\r\nof you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am only a fugitive, I am fleeing. In a little while my flight will\r\nhave been discovered. Maria--\"\r\n\r\nMaria Clara caught the youth's head in her hands and kissed him\r\nrepeatedly on the lips, embraced him, and drew abruptly away. \"Go,\r\ngo!\" she cried. \"Go, and farewell!\"\r\n\r\nIbarra gazed at her with shining eyes, but at a gesture from her\r\nmoved away--intoxicated, wavering.\r\n\r\nOnce again he leaped over the wall and stepped into the banka. Maria\r\nClara, leaning over the balustrade, watched him depart. Elias took\r\noff his hat and bowed to her profoundly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXI\r\n\r\nThe Chase on the Lake\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Listen, sir, to the plan that I have worked out,\" said Elias\r\nthoughtfully, as they moved in the direction of San Gabriel. \"I'll\r\nhide you now in the house of a friend of mine in Mandaluyong. I'll\r\nbring you all your money, which I saved and buried at the foot of\r\nthe balete in the mysterious tomb of your grandfather. Then you will\r\nleave the country.\"\r\n\r\n\"To go abroad?\" inquired Ibarra.\r\n\r\n\"To live out in peace the days of life that remain to you. You have\r\nfriends in Spain, you are rich, you can get yourself pardoned. In every\r\nway a foreign country is for us a better fatherland than our own.\"\r\n\r\nCrisostomo did not answer, but meditated in silence. At that moment\r\nthey reached the Pasig and the banka began to ascend the current. Over\r\nthe Bridge of Spain a horseman galloped rapidly, while a shrill,\r\nprolonged whistle was heard.\r\n\r\n\"Elias,\" said Ibarra, \"you owe your misfortunes to my family, you have\r\nsaved my life twice, and I owe you not only gratitude but also the\r\nrestitution of your fortune. You advise me to go abroad--then come\r\nwith me and we will live like brothers. Here you also are wretched.\"\r\n\r\nElias shook his head sadly and answered: \"Impossible! It's true that I\r\ncannot love or be happy in my country, but I can suffer and die in it,\r\nand perhaps for it--that is always something. May the misfortunes of\r\nmy native land be my own misfortunes and, although no noble sentiment\r\nunites us, although our hearts do not beat to a single name, at least\r\nmay the common calamity bind me to my countrymen, at least may I weep\r\nover our sorrows with them, may the same hard fate oppress all our\r\nhearts alike!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why do you advise me to go away?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because in some other country you could be happy while I could not,\r\nbecause you are not made to suffer, and because you would hate your\r\ncountry if some day you should see yourself ruined in its cause,\r\nand to hate one's native land is the greatest of calamities.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are unfair to me!\" exclaimed Ibarra with bitter reproach. \"You\r\nforget that scarcely had I arrived here when I set myself to seek\r\nits welfare.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be offended, sir, I was not reproaching you at all. Would\r\nthat all of us could imitate you! But I do not ask impossibilities\r\nof you and I mean no offense when I say that your heart deceives\r\nyou. You loved your country because your father taught you to do so;\r\nyou loved it because in it you had affection, fortune, youth, because\r\neverything smiled on you, your country had done you no injustice;\r\nyou loved it as we love anything that makes us happy. But the day in\r\nwhich you see yourself poor and hungry, persecuted, betrayed, and\r\nsold by your own countrymen, on that day you will disown yourself,\r\nyour country, and all mankind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your words pain me,\" said Ibarra resentfully.\r\n\r\nElias bowed his head and meditated before replying. \"I wish to\r\ndisillusion you, sir, and save you from a sad future. Recall that\r\nnight when I talked to you in this same banka under the light of\r\nthis same moon, not a month ago. Then you were happy, the plea of\r\nthe unfortunates did not touch you; you disdained their complaints\r\nbecause they were the complaints of criminals; you paid more attention\r\nto their enemies, and in spite of my arguments and petitions, you\r\nplaced yourself on the side of their oppressors. On you then depended\r\nwhether I should turn criminal or allow myself to be killed in order\r\nto carry out a sacred pledge, but God has not permitted this because\r\nthe old chief of the outlaws is dead. A month has hardly passed and\r\nyou think otherwise.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're right, Elias, but man is a creature of circumstances! Then\r\nI was blind, annoyed--what did I know? Now misfortune has torn\r\nthe bandage from my eyes; the solitude and misery of my prison have\r\ntaught me; now I see the horrible cancer which feeds upon this society,\r\nwhich clutches its flesh, and which demands a violent rooting out. They\r\nhave opened my eyes, they have made me see the sore, and they force me\r\nto be a criminal! Since they wish it, I will be a filibuster, a real\r\nfilibuster, I mean. I will call together all the unfortunates, all who\r\nfeel a heart beat in their breasts, all those who were sending you to\r\nme. No, I will not be a criminal, never is he such who fights for his\r\nnative land, but quite the reverse! We, during three centuries, have\r\nextended them our hands, we have asked love of them, we have yearned\r\nto call them brothers, and how do they answer us? With insults and\r\njests, denying us even the chance character of human beings. There\r\nis no God, there is no hope, there is no humanity; there is nothing\r\nbut the right of might!\" Ibarra was nervous, his whole body trembled.\r\n\r\nAs they passed in front of the Captain-General's palace they thought\r\nthat they could discern movement and excitement among the guards.\r\n\r\n\"Can they have discovered your flight?\" murmured Elias. \"Lie down,\r\nsir, so that I can cover you with zacate. Since we shall pass near\r\nthe powder-magazine it may seem suspicious to the sentinel that there\r\nare two of us.\"\r\n\r\nThe banka was one of those small, narrow canoes that do not seem to\r\nfloat but rather to glide over the top of the water. As Elias had\r\nforeseen, the sentinel stopped him and inquired whence he came.\r\n\r\n\"From Manila, to carry zacate to the judges and curates,\" he answered,\r\nimitating the accent of the people of Pandakan.\r\n\r\nA sergeant came out to learn what was happening. \"Move on!\" he said\r\nto Elias. \"But I warn you not to take anybody into your banka. A\r\nprisoner has just escaped. If you capture him and turn him over to\r\nme I'll give you a good tip.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, sir. What's his description?\"\r\n\r\n\"He wears a sack coat and talks Spanish. So look out!\" The banka moved\r\naway. Elias looked back and watched the silhouette of the sentinel\r\nstanding on the bank of the river.\r\n\r\n\"We'll lose a few minutes' time,\" he said in a low voice. \"We must\r\ngo into the Beata River to pretend that I'm from Peñafrancia. You\r\nwill see the river of which Francisco Baltazar sang.\"\r\n\r\nThe town slept in the moonlight, and Crisostomo rose up to admire the\r\nsepulchral peace of nature. The river was narrow and the level land\r\non either side covered with grass. Elias threw his cargo out on the\r\nbank and, after removing a large piece of bamboo, took from under\r\nthe grass some empty palm-leaf sacks. Then they continued on their way.\r\n\r\n\"You are the master of your own will, sir, and of your future,\" he said\r\nto Crisostomo, who had remained silent. \"But if you will allow me an\r\nobservation, I would say: think well what you are planning to do--you\r\nare going to light the flames of war, since you have money and brains,\r\nand you will quickly find many to join you, for unfortunately there\r\nare plenty of malcontents. But in this struggle which you are going\r\nto undertake, those who will suffer most will be the defenseless and\r\nthe innocent. The same sentiments that a month ago impelled me to\r\nappeal to you asking for reforms are those that move me now to urge\r\nyou to think well. The country, sir, does not think of separating from\r\nthe mother country; it only asks for a little freedom, justice, and\r\naffection. You will be supported by the malcontents, the criminals,\r\nthe desperate, but the people will hold aloof. You are mistaken if,\r\nseeing all dark, you think that the country is desperate. The country\r\nsuffers, yes, but it still hopes and trusts and will only rebel when\r\nit has lost its patience, that is, when those who govern it wish it\r\nto do so, and that time is yet distant. I myself will not follow you,\r\nnever will I resort to such extreme measures while I see hope in men.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I'll go on without you!\" responded Ibarra resolutely.\r\n\r\n\"Is your decision final?\"\r\n\r\n\"Final and firm; let the memory of my mother bear witness! I will\r\nnot let peace and happiness be torn away from me with impunity,\r\nI who desired only what was good, I who have respected everything\r\nand endured everything out of love for a hypocritical religion\r\nand out of love of country. How have they answered me? By burying\r\nme in an infamous dungeon and robbing me of my intended wife! No,\r\nnot to avenge myself would be a crime, it would be encouraging them\r\nto new acts of injustice! No, it would be cowardice, pusillanimity,\r\nto groan and weep when there is blood and life left, when to insult\r\nand menace is added mockery. I will call out these ignorant people,\r\nI will make them see their misery. I will teach them to think not of\r\nbrotherhood but only that they are wolves for devouring, I will urge\r\nthem to rise against this oppression and proclaim the eternal right\r\nof man to win his freedom!\"\r\n\r\n\"But innocent people will suffer!\"\r\n\r\n\"So much the better! Can you take me to the mountains?\"\r\n\r\n\"Until you are in safety,\" replied Elias.\r\n\r\nAgain they moved out into the Pasig, talking from time to time of\r\nindifferent matters.\r\n\r\n\"Santa Ana!\" murmured Ibarra. \"Do you recognize this building?\" They\r\nwere passing in front of the country-house of the Jesuits.\r\n\r\n\"There I spent many pleasant and happy days!\" sighed Elias. \"In my\r\ntime we came every month. Then I was like others, I had a fortune,\r\nfamily, I dreamed, I looked forward to a future. In those days I saw\r\nmy sister in the near-by college, she presented me with a piece of\r\nher own embroidery-work. A friend used to accompany her, a beautiful\r\ngirl. All that has passed like a dream.\"\r\n\r\nThey remained silent until they reached Malapad-na-bato. [171] Those\r\nwho have ever made their way by night up the Pasig, on one of those\r\nmagical nights that the Philippines offers, when the moon pours out\r\nfrom the limpid blue her melancholy light, when the shadows hide the\r\nmiseries of man and the silence is unbroken by the sordid accents of\r\nhis voice, when only Nature speaks--they will understand the thoughts\r\nof both these youths.\r\n\r\nAt Malapad-na-bato the carbineer was sleepy and, seeing that the banka\r\nwas empty and offered no booty which he might seize, according to the\r\ntraditional usage of his corps and the custom of that post, he easily\r\nlet them pass on. Nor did the civil-guard at Pasig suspect anything,\r\nso they were not molested.\r\n\r\nDay was beginning to break when they reached the lake, still and calm\r\nlike a gigantic mirror. The moon paled and the east was dyed in rosy\r\ntints. Some distance away they perceived a gray mass advancing slowly\r\ntoward them.\r\n\r\n\"The police boat is coming,\" murmured Elias. \"Lie down and I'll cover\r\nyou with these sacks.\"\r\n\r\nThe outlines of the boat became clearer and plainer.\r\n\r\n\"It's getting between us and the shore,\" observed Elias uneasily.\r\n\r\nGradually he changed the course of his banka, rowing toward\r\nBinangonan. To his great surprise he noticed that the boat also\r\nchanged its course, while a voice called to him.\r\n\r\nElias stopped rowing and reflected. The shore was still far away and\r\nthey would soon be within range of the rifles on the police boat. He\r\nthought of returning to Pasig, for his banka was the swifter of the\r\ntwo boats, but unluckily he saw another boat coming from the river\r\nand made out the gleam of caps and bayonets of the Civil Guard.\r\n\r\n\"We're caught!\" he muttered, turning pale.\r\n\r\nHe gazed at his robust arms and, adopting the only course left,\r\nbegan to row with all his might toward Talim Island, just as the sun\r\nwas rising.\r\n\r\nThe banka slipped rapidly along. Elias saw standing on the boat,\r\nwhich had veered about, some men making signals to him.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know how to manage a banka?\" he asked Ibarra.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because we are lost if I don't jump into the water and throw them\r\noff the track. They will pursue me, but I swim and dive well. I'll\r\ndraw them away from you and then you can save yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, stay here, and we'll sell our lives dearly!\"\r\n\r\n\"That would be useless. We have no arms and with their rifles they\r\nwould shoot us down like birds.\"\r\n\r\nAt that instant the water gave forth a hiss such as is caused by\r\nthe falling of hot metal into it, followed instantaneously by a\r\nloud report.\r\n\r\n\"You see!\" said Elias, placing the paddle in the boat. \"We'll see each\r\nother on Christmas Eve at the tomb of your grandfather. Save yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you?\"\r\n\r\n\"God has carried me safely through greater perils.\"\r\n\r\nAs Elias took off his camisa a bullet tore it from his hands and\r\ntwo loud reports were heard. Calmly he clasped the hand of Ibarra,\r\nwho was still stretched out in the bottom of the banka. Then he arose\r\nand leaped into the water, at the same time pushing the little craft\r\naway from him with his foot.\r\n\r\nCries resounded, and soon some distance away the youth's head appeared,\r\nas if for breathing, then instantly disappeared.\r\n\r\n\"There, there he is!\" cried several voices, and again the bullets\r\nwhistled.\r\n\r\nThe police boat and the boat from the Pasig now started in pursuit of\r\nhim. A light track indicated his passage through the water as he drew\r\nfarther and farther away from Ibarra's banka, which floated about as\r\nif abandoned. Every time the swimmer lifted his head above the water\r\nto breathe, the guards in both boats shot at him.\r\n\r\nSo the chase continued. Ibarra's little banka was now far away\r\nand the swimmer was approaching the shore, distant some thirty\r\nyards. The rowers were tired, but Elias was in the same condition,\r\nfor he showed his head oftener, and each time in a different direction,\r\nas if to disconcert his pursuers. No longer did the treacherous track\r\nindicate the position of the diver. They saw him for the last time\r\nwhen he was some ten yards from the shore, and fired. Then minute\r\nafter minute passed, but nothing again appeared above the still and\r\nsolitary surface of the lake.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour afterwards one of the rowers claimed that he could\r\ndistinguish in the water near the shore traces of blood, but his\r\ncompanions shook their heads dubiously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXII\r\n\r\nPadre Damaso Explains\r\n\r\n\r\nVainly were the rich wedding presents heaped upon a table; neither\r\nthe diamonds in their cases of blue velvet, nor the piña embroideries,\r\nnor the rolls of silk, drew the gaze of Maria Clara. Without reading\r\nor even seeing it the maiden sat staring at the newspaper which gave\r\nan account of the death of Ibarra, drowned in the lake.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she felt two hands placed over her eyes to hold her fast\r\nand heard Padre Damaso's voice ask merrily, \"Who am I? Who am I?\"\r\n\r\nMaria Clara sprang from her seat and gazed at him in terror.\r\n\r\n\"Foolish little girl, you're not afraid, are you? You weren't expecting\r\nme, eh? Well, I've come in from the provinces to attend your wedding.\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled with satisfaction as he drew nearer to her and held out\r\nhis hand for her to kiss. Maria Clara approached him tremblingly and\r\ntouched his hand respectfully to her lips.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter with you, Maria?\" asked the Franciscan, losing his\r\nmerry smile and becoming uneasy. \"Your hand is cold, you're pale. Are\r\nyou ill, little girl?\"\r\n\r\nPadre Damaso drew her toward himself with a tenderness that one would\r\nhardly have thought him capable of, and catching both her hands in\r\nhis questioned her with his gaze.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you have confidence in your godfather any more?\" he asked\r\nreproachfully. \"Come, sit down and tell me your little troubles as\r\nyou used to do when you were a child, when you wanted tapers to make\r\nwax dolls, You know that I've always loved you, I've never been cross\r\nwith you.\"\r\n\r\nHis voice was now no longer brusque, and even became tenderly\r\nmodulated. Maria Clara began to weep.\r\n\r\n\"You're crying, little girl? Why do you cry? Have you quarreled\r\nwith Linares?\"\r\n\r\nMaria Clara covered her ears. \"Don't speak of him not now!\" she cried.\r\n\r\nPadre Damaso gazed at her in startled wonder.\r\n\r\n\"Won't you trust me with your secrets? Haven't I always tried to\r\nsatisfy your lightest whim?\"\r\n\r\nThe maiden raised eyes filled with tears and stared at him for a long\r\ntime, then again fell to weeping bitterly.\r\n\r\n\"Don't cry so, little girl. Your tears hurt me. Tell me your troubles,\r\nand you'll see how your godfather loves you!\"\r\n\r\nMaria Clara approached him slowly, fell upon her knees, and raising\r\nher tear-stained face toward his asked in a low, scarcely audible tone,\r\n\"Do you still love me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Child!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, protect my father and break off my marriage!\" Here the\r\nmaiden told of her last interview with Ibarra, concealing only her\r\nknowledge of the secret of her birth. Padre Damaso could scarcely\r\ncredit his ears.\r\n\r\n\"While he lived,\" the girl continued, \"I thought of struggling, I\r\nwas hoping, trusting! I wanted to live so that I might hear of him,\r\nbut now that they have killed him, now there is no reason why I should\r\nlive and suffer.\" She spoke in low, measured tones, calmly, tearlessly.\r\n\r\n\"But, foolish girl, isn't Linares a thousand times better than--\"\r\n\r\n\"While he lived, I could have married--I thought of running away\r\nafterwards--my father wants only the relationship! But now that he\r\nis dead, no other man shall call me wife! While he was alive I could\r\ndebase myself, for there would have remained the consolation that he\r\nlived and perhaps thought of me, but now that he is dead--the nunnery\r\nor the tomb!\"\r\n\r\nThe girl's voice had a ring of firmness in it such that Padre Damaso\r\nlost his merry air and became very thoughtful.\r\n\r\n\"Did you love him as much as that?\" he stammered.\r\n\r\nMaria Clara did not answer. Padre Damaso dropped his head on his\r\nchest and remained silent for a long time.\r\n\r\n\"Daughter in God,\" he exclaimed at length in a broken voice, \"forgive\r\nme for having made you unhappy without knowing it. I was thinking\r\nof your future, I desired your happiness. How could I permit you\r\nto marry a native of the country, to see you an unhappy wife and\r\na wretched mother? I couldn't get that love out of your head even\r\nthough I opposed it with all my might. I committed wrongs, for you,\r\nsolely for you. If you had become his wife you would have mourned\r\nafterwards over the condition of your husband, exposed to all kinds\r\nof vexations without means of defense. As a mother you would have\r\nmourned the fate of your sons: if you had educated them, you would have\r\nprepared for them a sad future, for they would have become enemies\r\nof Religion and you would have seen them garroted or exiled; if you\r\nhad kept them ignorant, you would have seen them tyrannized over and\r\ndegraded. I could not consent to it! For this reason I sought for\r\nyou a husband that could make you the happy mother of sons who would\r\ncommand and not obey, who would punish and not suffer. I knew that\r\nthe friend of your childhood was good, I liked him as well as his\r\nfather, but I have hated them both since I saw that they were going\r\nto bring about your unhappiness, because I love you, I adore you,\r\nI love you as one loves his own daughter! Yours is my only affection;\r\nI have seen you grow--not an hour has passed that I have not thought\r\nof you--I dreamed of you--you have been my only joy!\"\r\n\r\nHere Padre Damaso himself broke out into tears like a child.\r\n\r\n\"Then, as you love me, don't make me eternally wretched. He no longer\r\nlives, so I want to be a nun!\"\r\n\r\nThe old priest rested his forehead on his hand. \"To be a nun, a\r\nnun!\" he repeated. \"You don't know, child, what the life is, the\r\nmystery that is hidden behind the walls of the nunnery, you don't\r\nknow! A thousand times would I prefer to see you unhappy in the\r\nworld rather than in the cloister. Here your complaints can be heard,\r\nthere you will have only the walls. You are beautiful, very beautiful,\r\nand you were not born for that--to be a bride of Christ! Believe me,\r\nlittle girl, time will wipe away everything. Later on you will forget,\r\nyou will love, you will love your husband--Linares.\"\r\n\r\n\"The nunnery or--death!\"\r\n\r\n\"The nunnery, the nunnery, or death!\" exclaimed Padre Damaso. \"Maria,\r\nI am now an old man, I shall not be able much longer to watch over\r\nyou and your welfare. Choose something else, seek another love,\r\nsome other man, whoever he may be--anything but the nunnery.\"\r\n\r\n\"The nunnery or death!\"\r\n\r\n\"My God, my God!\" cried the priest, covering his head with his hands,\r\n\"Thou chastisest me, so let it be! But watch over my daughter!\"\r\n\r\nThen, turning again to the young woman, he said, \"You wish to be a nun,\r\nand it shall be so. I don't want you to die.\"\r\n\r\nMaria Clara caught both his hands in hers, clasping and kissing them\r\nas she fell upon her knees, repeating over and over, \"My godfather,\r\nI thank you, my godfather!\"\r\n\r\nWith bowed head Fray Damaso went away, sad and sighing. \"God, Thou\r\ndost exist, since Thou chastisest! But let Thy vengeance fall on me,\r\nharm not the innocent. Save Thou my daughter!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIII\r\n\r\nChristmas Eve\r\n\r\n\r\nHigh up on the slope of the mountain near a roaring stream a hut built\r\non the gnarled logs hides itself among the trees. Over its kogon\r\nthatch clambers the branching gourd-vine, laden with flowers and\r\nfruit. Deer antlers and skulls of wild boar, some with long tusks,\r\nadorn this mountain home, where lives a Tagalog family engaged in\r\nhunting and cutting firewood.\r\n\r\nIn the shade of a tree the grandsire was making brooms from the fibers\r\nof palm leaves, while a young woman was placing eggs, limes, and some\r\nvegetables in a wide basket. Two children, a boy and a girl, were\r\nplaying by the side of another, who, pale and sad, with large eyes\r\nand a deep gaze, was seated on a fallen tree-trunk. In his thinned\r\nfeatures we recognize Sisa's son, Basilio, the brother of Crispin.\r\n\r\n\"When your foot gets well,\" the little girl was saying to him,\r\n\"we'll play hide-and-seek. I'll be the leader.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll go up to the top of the mountain with us,\" added the little\r\nboy, \"and drink deer blood with lime-juice and you'll get fat, and\r\nthen I'll teach you how to jump from rock to rock above the torrent.\"\r\n\r\nBasilio smiled sadly, stared at the sore on his foot, and then turned\r\nhis gaze toward the sun, which shone resplendently.\r\n\r\n\"Sell these brooms,\" said the grandfather to the young woman, \"and\r\nbuy something for the children, for tomorrow is Christmas.\"\r\n\r\n\"Firecrackers, I want some firecrackers!\" exclaimed the boy.\r\n\r\n\"I want a head for my doll,\" cried the little girl, catching hold of\r\nher sister's tapis.\r\n\r\n\"And you, what do you want?\" the grandfather asked Basilio, who at\r\nthe question arose laboriously and approached the old man.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" he said, \"I've been sick more than a month now, haven't I?\"\r\n\r\n\"Since we found you lifeless and covered with wounds, two moons have\r\ncome and gone. We thought you were going to die.\"\r\n\r\n\"May God reward you, for we are very poor,\" replied Basilio. \"But now\r\nthat tomorrow is Christmas I want to go to the town to see my mother\r\nand my little brother. They will be seeking for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, my son, you're not yet well, and your town is far away. You\r\nwon't get there by midnight.\"\r\n\r\n\"That doesn't matter, sir. My mother and my little brother must be\r\nvery sad. Every year we spend this holiday together. Last year the\r\nthree of us had a whole fish to eat. My mother will have been mourning\r\nand looking for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You won't get to the town alive, boy! Tonight we're going to have\r\nchicken and wild boar's meat. My sons will ask for you when they come\r\nfrom the field.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have many sons while my mother has only us two. Perhaps she\r\nalready believes that I'm dead! Tonight I want to give her a pleasant\r\nsurprise, a Christmas gift, a son.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man felt the tears springing up into his eyes, so, placing\r\nhis hands on the boy's head, he said with emotion: \"You're like an\r\nold man! Go, look for your mother, give her the Christmas gift--from\r\nGod, as you say. If I had known the name of your town I would have\r\ngone there when you were sick. Go, my son, and may God and the Lord\r\nJesus go with you. Lucia, my granddaughter, will go with you to the\r\nnearest town.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! You're going away?\" the little boy asked him. \"Down there are\r\nsoldiers and many robbers. Don't you want to see my firecrackers? Boom,\r\nboom, boom!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you want to play hide-and-seek?\" asked the little girl. \"Have\r\nyou ever played it? Surely there's nothing any more fun than to be\r\nchased and hide yourself?\"\r\n\r\nBasilio smiled, but with tears in his eyes, and caught up his\r\nstaff. \"I'll come back soon,\" he answered. \"I'll bring my little\r\nbrother, you'll see him and play with him. He's just about as big as\r\nyou are.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does he walk lame, too?\" asked the little girl. \"Then we'll make him\r\n'it' when we play hide-and-seek.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't forget us,\" the old man said to him. \"Take this dried meat as\r\na present to your mother.\"\r\n\r\nThe children accompanied him to the bamboo bridge swung over the\r\nnoisy course of the stream. Lucia made him support himself on her arm,\r\nand thus they disappeared from the children's sight, Basilio walking\r\nalong nimbly in spite of his bandaged leg.\r\n\r\nThe north wind whistled by, making the inhabitants of San Diego\r\nshiver with cold. It was Christmas Eve and yet the town was wrapped\r\nin gloom. Not a paper lantern hung from the windows nor did a single\r\nsound in the houses indicate the rejoicing of other years.\r\n\r\nIn the house of Capitan Basilio, he and Don Filipo--for the misfortunes\r\nof the latter had made them friendly--were standing by a window-grating\r\nand talking, while at another were Sinang, her cousin Victoria,\r\nand the beautiful Iday, looking toward the street.\r\n\r\nThe waning moon began to shine over the horizon, illumining the clouds\r\nand making the trees and houses east long, fantastic shadows.\r\n\r\n\"Yours is not a little good fortune, to get off free in these\r\ntimes!\" said Capitan Basilio to Don Filipo. \"They've burned your books,\r\nyes, but others have lost more.\"\r\n\r\nA woman approached the grating and gazed into the interior. Her\r\neyes glittered, her features were emaciated, her hair loose and\r\ndishevelled. The moonlight gave her a weird aspect.\r\n\r\n\"Sisal\" exclaimed Don Filipo in surprise. Then turning to Capitan\r\nBasilio, as the madwoman ran away, he asked, \"Wasn't she in the house\r\nof a physician? Has she been cured?\"\r\n\r\nCapitan Basilio smiled bitterly. \"The physician was afraid they\r\nwould accuse him of being a friend of Don Crisostomo's, so he drove\r\nher from his house. Now she wanders about again as crazy as ever,\r\nsinging, harming no one, and living in the woods.\"\r\n\r\n\"What else has happened in the town since we left it? I know that we\r\nhave a new curate and another alferez.\"\r\n\r\n\"These are terrible times, humanity is retrograding,\" murmured Capitan\r\nBasilio, thinking of the past. \"The day after you left they found the\r\nsenior sacristan dead, hanging from a rafter in his own house. Padre\r\nSalvi was greatly affected by his death and took possession of all\r\nhis papers. Ah, yes, the old Sage, Tasio, also died and was buried\r\nin the Chinese cemetery.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor old man!\" sighed Don Filipo. \"What became of his books?\"\r\n\r\n\"They were burned by the pious, who thought thus to please God. I was\r\nunable to save anything, not even Cicero's works. The gobernadorcillo\r\ndid nothing to prevent it.\"\r\n\r\nBoth became silent. At that moment the sad and melancholy song of\r\nthe madwoman was heard.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know when Maria Clara is to be married?\" Iday asked Sinang.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" answered the latter. \"I received a letter from her\r\nbut haven't opened it for fear of finding out. Poor Crisostomo!\"\r\n\r\n\"They say that if it were not for Linares, they would hang Capitan\r\nTiago, so what was Maria Clara going to do?\" observed Victoria.\r\n\r\nA boy limped by, running toward the plaza, whence came the notes of\r\nSisa's song. It was Basilio, who had found his home deserted and in\r\nruins. After many inquiries he had only learned that his mother was\r\ninsane and wandering about the town--of Crispin not a word.\r\n\r\nBasilio choked back his tears, stifled any expression of his sorrow,\r\nand without resting had started in search of his mother. On reaching\r\nthe town he was just asking about her when her song struck his\r\nears. The unhappy boy overcame the trembling in his limbs and ran to\r\nthrow himself into his mother's arms.\r\n\r\nThe madwoman left the plaza and stopped in front of the house of\r\nthe new alferez. Now, as formerly, there was a sentinel before the\r\ndoor, and a woman's head appeared at the window, only it was not the\r\nMedusa's but that of a comely young woman: alferez and unfortunate\r\nare not synonymous terms.\r\n\r\nSisa began to sing before the house with her gaze fixed on the\r\nmoon, which soared majestically in the blue heavens among golden\r\nclouds. Basilio saw her, but did not dare to approach' her. Walking\r\nback and forth, but taking care not to get near the barracks, he\r\nwaited for the time when she would leave that place.\r\n\r\nThe young woman who was at the window listening attentively to the\r\nmadwoman's song ordered the sentinel to bring her inside, but when\r\nSisa saw the soldier approach her and heard his voice she was filled\r\nwith terror and took to flight at a speed of which only a demented\r\nperson is capable. Basilio, fearing to lose her, ran after her,\r\nforgetful of the pains in his feet.\r\n\r\n\"Look how that boy's chasing the madwoman!\" indignantly exclaimed\r\na woman in the street. Seeing that he continued to pursue her, she\r\npicked up a stone and threw it at him, saying, \"Take that! It's a\r\npity that the dog is tied up!\"\r\n\r\nBasilio felt a blow on his head, but paid no attention to it as he\r\ncontinued running. Dogs barked, geese cackled, several windows opened\r\nto let out curious faces but quickly closed again from fear of another\r\nnight of terror.\r\n\r\nSoon they were outside of the town. Sisa began to moderate her flight,\r\nbut still a great distance separated her from her pursuer.\r\n\r\n\"Mother!\" he called to her when he caught sight of her. Scarcely had\r\nthe madwoman heard his voice when she again took to flight.\r\n\r\n\"Mother, it's I!\" cried the boy in desperation, but the madwoman\r\ndid not heed him, so he followed panting. They had now passed the\r\ncultivated fields and were near the wood; Basilio saw his mother enter\r\nit and he also went in. The bushes and shrubs, the thorny vines and\r\nprojecting roots of trees, hindered the movements of both. The son\r\nfollowed his mother's shadowy form as it was revealed from time to\r\ntime by the moonlight that penetrated through the foliage and into\r\nthe open spaces. They were in the mysterious wood of the Ibarra family.\r\n\r\nThe boy stumbled and fell several times, but rose again, each time\r\nwithout feeling pain. All his soul was centered in his eyes, following\r\nthe beloved figure. They crossed the sweetly murmuring brook where\r\nsharp thorns of bamboo that had fallen on the sand at its margin\r\npierced his bare feet, but he did not stop to pull them out.\r\n\r\nTo his great surprise he saw that his mother had plunged into the\r\nthick undergrowth and was going through the wooden gateway that opened\r\ninto the tomb of the old Spaniard at the foot of the balete. Basilio\r\ntried to follow her in, but found the gate fastened. The madwoman\r\ndefended the entrance with her emaciated arms and disheveled head,\r\nholding the gate shut with all her might.\r\n\r\n\"Mother, it's I, it's I! I'm Basilio, your son!\" cried the boy as he\r\nlet himself fall weakly.\r\n\r\nBut the madwoman did not yield. Bracing herself with her feet on\r\nthe ground, she offered an energetic resistance. Basilio beat the\r\ngate with his fists, with his Mood-stained head, he wept, but in\r\nvain. Painfully he arose and examined the wall, thinking to scale it,\r\nbut found no way to do so. He then walked around it and noticed that\r\na branch of the fateful balete was crossed with one from another\r\ntree. This he climbed and, his filial love working miracles, made\r\nhis way from branch to branch to the balete, from which he saw his\r\nmother still holding the gate shut with her head.\r\n\r\nThe noise made by him among the branches attracted Sisa's\r\nattention. She turned and tried to run, but her son, letting himself\r\nfall from the tree, caught her in his arms and covered her with kisses,\r\nlosing consciousness as he did so.\r\n\r\nSisa saw his blood-stained forehead and bent over him. Her eyes seemed\r\nto start from their sockets as she peered into his face. Those pale\r\nfeatures stirred the sleeping cells of her brain, so that something\r\nlike a spark of intelligence flashed up in her mind and she recognized\r\nher son. With a terrible cry she fell upon the insensible body of\r\nthe boy, embracing and kissing him. Mother and son remained motionless.\r\n\r\nWhen Basilio recovered consciousness he found his mother lifeless. He\r\ncalled to her with the tenderest names, but she did not awake. Noticing\r\nthat she was not even breathing, he arose and went to the neighboring\r\nbrook to get some water in a banana leaf, with which to rub the pallid\r\nface of his mother, but the madwoman made not the least movement and\r\nher eyes remained closed.\r\n\r\nBasilio gazed at her in terror. He placed his ear over her heart,\r\nbut the thin, faded breast was cold, and her heart no longer beat. He\r\nput his lips to hers, but felt no breathing. The miserable boy threw\r\nhis arms about the corpse and wept bitterly.\r\n\r\nThe moon gleamed majestically in the sky, the wandering breezes sighed,\r\nand down in the grass the crickets chirped. The night of light and joy\r\nfor so many children, who in the warm bosom of the family celebrate\r\nthis feast of sweetest memories--the feast which commemorates the\r\nfirst look of love that Heaven sent to earth--this night when in all\r\nChristian families they eat, drink, dance, sing, laugh, play, caress,\r\nand kiss one another--this night, which in cold countries holds such\r\nmagic for childhood with its traditional pine-tree covered with lights,\r\ndolls, candies, and tinsel, whereon gaze the round, staring eyes in\r\nwhich innocence alone is reflected--this night brought to Basilio\r\nonly orphanhood. Who knows but that perhaps in the home whence came\r\nthe taciturn Padre Salvi children also played, perhaps they sang\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"La Nochebuena se viene,\r\n    La Nochebuena se va.\" [172]\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a long time the boy wept and moaned. When at last he raised his\r\nhead he saw a man standing over him, gazing at the scene in silence.\r\n\r\n\"Are you her son?\" asked the unknown in a low voice.\r\n\r\nThe boy nodded.\r\n\r\n\"What do you expect to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bury her!\"\r\n\r\n\"In the cemetery?\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't any money and, besides, the curate wouldn't allow it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you would help me--\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm very weak,\" answered the unknown as he sank slowly to the ground,\r\nsupporting himself with both hands. \"I'm wounded. For two days I\r\nhaven't eaten or slept. Has no one come here tonight?\"\r\n\r\nThe man thoughtfully contemplated the attractive features of the boy,\r\nthen went on in a still weaker voice, \"Listen! I, too, shall be dead\r\nbefore the day comes. Twenty paces from here, on the other side of\r\nthe brook, there is a big pile of firewood. Bring it here, make a\r\npyre, put our bodies upon it, cover them over, and set fire to the\r\nwhole--fire, until we are reduced to ashes!\"\r\n\r\nBasilio listened attentively.\r\n\r\n\"Afterwards, if no one comes, dig here. You will find a lot of gold\r\nand it will all be yours. Take it and go to school.\"\r\n\r\nThe voice of the unknown was becoming every moment more\r\nunintelligible. \"Go, get the firewood. I want to help you.\"\r\n\r\nAs Basilio moved away, the unknown turned his face toward the east\r\nand murmured, as though praying:\r\n\r\n\"I die without seeing the dawn brighten over my native land! You,\r\nwho have it to see, welcome it--and forget not those who have fallen\r\nduring the night!\"\r\n\r\nHe raised his eyes to the sky and his lips continued to move, as if\r\nuttering a prayer. Then he bowed his head and sank slowly to the earth.\r\n\r\nTwo hours later Sister Rufa was on the back veranda of her house\r\nmaking her morning ablutions in order to attend mass. The pious woman\r\ngazed at the adjacent wood and saw a thick column of smoke rising\r\nfrom it. Filled with holy indignation, she knitted her eyebrows\r\nand exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"What heretic is making a clearing on a holy day? That's why so many\r\ncalamities come! You ought to go to purgatory and see if you could\r\nget out of there, savage!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEPILOGUE\r\n\r\n\r\nSince some of our characters are still living and others have been lost\r\nsight of, a real epilogue is impossible. For the satisfaction of the\r\ngroundlings we should gladly kill off all of them, beginning with Padre\r\nSalvi and ending with Doña Victorina, but this is not possible. Let\r\nthem live! Anyhow, the country, not ourselves, has to support them.\r\n\r\nAfter Maria Clara entered the nunnery, Padre Damaso left his town\r\nto live in Manila, as did also Padre Salvi, who, while he awaits a\r\nvacant miter, preaches sometimes in the church of St. Clara, in whose\r\nnunnery he discharges the duties of an important office. Not many\r\nmonths had passed when Padre Damaso received an order from the Very\r\nReverend Father Provincial to occupy a curacy in a remote province. It\r\nis related that he was so grievously affected by this that on the\r\nfollowing day he was found dead in his bedchamber. Some said that\r\nhe had died of an apoplectic stroke, others of a nightmare, but his\r\nphysician dissipated all doubts by declaring that he had died suddenly.\r\n\r\nNone of our readers would now recognize Capitan Tiago. Weeks before\r\nMaria Clara took the vows he fell into a state of depression so great\r\nthat he grew sad and thin, and became pensive and distrustful, like\r\nhis former friend, Capitan Tinong. As soon as the doors of the nunnery\r\nclosed he ordered his disconsolate cousin, Aunt Isabel, to collect\r\nwhatever had belonged to his daughter and his dead wife and to go to\r\nmake her home in Malabon or San Diego, since he wished to live alone\r\nthenceforward, tie then devoted himself passionately to _liam-pó_ and\r\nthe cockpit, and began to smoke opium. He no longer goes to Antipolo\r\nnor does he order any more masses, so Doña Patrocinia, his old rival,\r\ncelebrates her triumph piously by snoring during the sermons. If at\r\nany time during the late afternoon you should walk along Calle Santo\r\nCristo, you would see seated in a Chinese shop a small man, yellow,\r\nthin, and bent, with stained and dirty finger nails, gazing through\r\ndreamy, sunken eyes at the passers-by as if he did not see them. At\r\nnightfall you would see him rise with difficulty and, supporting\r\nhimself on his cane, make his way to a narrow little by-street to\r\nenter a grimy building over the door of which may be seen in large\r\nred letters: FUMADERO PUBLICO DE ANFION. [173] This is that Capitan\r\nTiago who was so celebrated, but who is now completely forgotten,\r\neven by the very senior sacristan himself.\r\n\r\nDoña Victorina has added to her false frizzes and to her\r\n_Andalusization_, if we may be permitted the term, the new custom\r\nof driving the carriage horses herself, obliging Don Tiburcio to\r\nremain quiet. Since many unfortunate accidents occurred on account\r\nof the weakness of her eyes, she has taken to wearing spectacles,\r\nwhich give her a marvelous appearance. The doctor has never been\r\ncalled upon again to attend any one and the servants see him many\r\ndays in the week without teeth, which, as our readers know, is a\r\nvery bad sign. Linares, the only defender of the hapless doctor,\r\nhas long been at rest in Paco cemetery, the victim of dysentery and\r\nthe harsh treatment of his cousin-in-law.\r\n\r\nThe victorious alferez returned to Spain a major, leaving his\r\namiable spouse in her flannel camisa, the color of which is now\r\nindescribable. The poor Ariadne, finding herself thus abandoned,\r\nalso devoted herself, as did the daughter of Minos, to the cult of\r\nBacchus and the cultivation of tobacco; she drinks and smokes with\r\nsuch fury that now not only the girls but even the old women and\r\nlittle children fear her.\r\n\r\nProbably our acquaintances of the town of San Diego are still alive,\r\nif they did not perish in the explosion of the steamer \"_Lipa_,\" which\r\nwas making a trip to the province. Since no one bothered himself to\r\nlearn who the unfortunates were that perished in that catastrophe or to\r\nwhom belonged the legs and arms left neglected on Convalescence Island\r\nand the banks of the river, we have no idea whether any acquaintance\r\nof our readers was among them or not. Along with the government and\r\nthe press at the time, we are satisfied with the information that\r\nthe only friar who was on the steamer was saved, and we do not ask\r\nfor more. The principal thing for us is the existence of the virtuous\r\npriests, whose reign in the Philippines may God conserve for the good\r\nof our souls. [174]\r\n\r\nOf Maria Clara nothing more is known except that the sepulcher seems\r\nto guard her in its bosom. We have asked several persons of great\r\ninfluence in the holy nunnery of St. Clara, but no one has been\r\nwilling to tell us a single word, not even the talkative devotees\r\nwho receive the famous fried chicken-livers and the even more famous\r\nsauce known as that \"of the nuns,\" prepared by the intelligent cook\r\nof the Virgins of the Lord.\r\n\r\nNevertheless: On a night in September the hurricane raged over\r\nManila, lashing the buildings with its gigantic wings. The thunder\r\ncrashed continuously. Lightning flashes momentarily revealed the havoc\r\nwrought by the blast and threw the inhabitants into wild terror. The\r\nrain fell in torrents. Each flash of the forked lightning showed a\r\npiece of roofing or a window-blind flying through the air to fall\r\nwith a horrible crash. Not a person or a carriage moved through the\r\nstreets. When the hoarse reverberations of the thunder, a hundred\r\ntimes re-echoed, lost themselves in the distance, there was heard\r\nthe soughing of the wind as it drove the raindrops with a continuous\r\ntick-tack against the concha-panes of the closed windows.\r\n\r\nTwo patrolmen sheltered themselves under the eaves of a building near\r\nthe nunnery, one a private and the other a _distinguido_.\r\n\r\n\"What's the use of our staying here?\" said the private.\r\n\r\n\"No one is moving about the streets. We ought to get into a house. My\r\n_querida_ lives in Calle Arzobispo.\"\r\n\r\n\"From here over there is quite a distance and we'll get wet,\" answered\r\nthe _distinguido_.\r\n\r\n\"What does that matter just so the lightning doesn't strike us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah, don't worry! The nuns surely have a lightningrod to protect\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" observed the private, \"but of what use is it when the night\r\nis so dark?\"\r\n\r\nAs he said this he looked upward to stare into the darkness. At\r\nthat moment a prolonged streak of lightning flashed, followed by a\r\nterrific roar.\r\n\r\n\"_Nakú! Susmariosep!_\" exclaimed the private, crossing himself and\r\ncatching hold of his companion. \"Let's get away from here.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, come away from here,\" he repeated with his teeth rattling\r\nfrom fear.\r\n\r\n\"What have you seen?\"\r\n\r\n\"A specter!\" he murmured, trembling with fright.\r\n\r\n\"A specter?\"\r\n\r\n\"On the roof there. It must be the nun who practises magic during\r\nthe night.\"\r\n\r\nThe _distinguido_ thrust his head out to look, just as a flash of\r\nlightning furrowed the heavens with a vein of fire and sent a horrible\r\ncrash earthwards. \"_Jesús!_\" he exclaimed, also crossing himself.\r\n\r\nIn the brilliant glare of the celestial light he had seen a white\r\nfigure standing almost on the ridge of the roof with arms and face\r\nraised toward the sky as if praying to it. The heavens responded with\r\nlightning and thunderbolts!\r\n\r\nAs the sound of the thunder rolled away a sad plaint was heard.\r\n\r\n\"That's not the wind, it's the specter,\" murmured the private, as if\r\nin response to the pressure of his companion's hand.\r\n\r\n\"Ay! Ay!\" came through the air, rising above the noise of the rain,\r\nnor could the whistling wind drown that sweet and mournful voice\r\ncharged with affliction.\r\n\r\nAgain the lightning flashed with dazzling intensity.\r\n\r\n\"No, it's not a specter!\" exclaimed the _distinguido_.\r\n\r\n\"I've seen her before. She's beautiful, like the Virgin! Let's get\r\naway from here and report it.\"\r\n\r\nThe private did not wait for him to repeat the invitation, and both\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nWho was moaning in the middle of the night in spite of the wind and\r\nrain and storm? Who was the timid maiden, the bride of Christ, who\r\ndefied the unchained elements and chose such a fearful night under the\r\nopen sky to breathe forth from so perilous a height her complaints\r\nto God? Had the Lord abandoned his altar in the nunnery so that He\r\nno longer heard her supplications? Did its arches perhaps prevent the\r\nlongings of the soul from rising up to the throne of the Most Merciful?\r\n\r\nThe tempest raged furiously nearly the whole night, nor did a single\r\nstar shine through the darkness. The despairing plaints continued to\r\nmingle with the soughing of the wind, but they found Nature and man\r\nalike deaf; God had hidden himself and heard not.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, after the dark clouds had cleared away and the\r\nsun shone again brightly in the limpid sky, there stopped at the door\r\nof the nunnery of St. Clara a carriage, from which alighted a man\r\nwho made himself known as a representative of the authorities. He\r\nasked to be allowed to speak immediately with the abbess and to see\r\nall the nuns.\r\n\r\nIt is said that one of these, who appeared in a gown all wet and torn,\r\nwith tears and tales of horror begged the man's protection against\r\nthe outrages of hypocrisy. It is also said that she was very beautiful\r\nand had the most lovely and expressive eyes that were ever seen.\r\n\r\nThe representative of the authorities did not accede to her request,\r\nbut, after talking with the abbess, left her there in spite of her\r\ntears and pleadings. The youthful nun saw the door close behind him\r\nas a condemned person might look upon the portals of Heaven closing\r\nagainst him, if ever Heaven should come to be as cruel and unfeeling\r\nas men are. The abbess said that she was a madwoman. The man may\r\nnot have known that there is in Manila a home for the demented;\r\nor perhaps he looked upon the nunnery itself as an insane asylum,\r\nalthough it is claimed that he was quite ignorant, especially in a\r\nmatter of deciding whether a person is of sound mind.\r\n\r\nIt is also reported that General J---- thought otherwise, when the\r\nmatter reached his ears. He wished to protect the madwoman and asked\r\nfor her. But this time no beautiful and unprotected maiden appeared,\r\nnor would the abbess permit a visit to the cloister, forbidding it\r\nin the name of Religion and the Holy Statutes. Nothing more was said\r\nof the affair, nor of the ill-starred Maria Clara.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGLOSSARY\r\n\r\n\r\n_abá_: A Tagalog exclamation of wonder, surprise, etc., often used\r\nto introduce or emphasize a contradictory statement.\r\n\r\n_abaka_: \"Manila hemp,\" the fiber of a plant of the banana family.\r\n\r\n_achara_: Pickles made from the tender shoots of bamboo, green\r\npapayas, etc.\r\n\r\n_alcalde_: Governor of a province or district with both executive\r\nand judicial authority.\r\n\r\n_alferez_: Junior officer of the Civil Guard, ranking next below\r\na lieutenant.\r\n\r\n_alibambang_: A leguminous plant whose acid leaves are used in cooking.\r\n\r\n_alpay_: A variety of nephelium, similar but inferior to the Chinese\r\nlichi.\r\n\r\n_among_: Term used by the natives in addressing a priest, especially\r\na friar: from the Spanish _amo_, master.\r\n\r\n_amores-secos_: \"Barren loves,\" a low-growing weed whose small,\r\nangular pods adhere to clothing.\r\n\r\n_andas_: A platform with handles, on which an image is borne in\r\na procession.\r\n\r\n_asuang_: A malignant devil reputed to feed upon human flesh, being\r\nespecially fond of new-born babes.\r\n\r\n_até_: The sweet-sop.\r\n\r\n_Audiencia_: The administrative council and supreme court of the\r\nSpanish régime.\r\n\r\n_Ayuntamiento_: A city corporation or council, and by extension\r\nthe building in which it has its offices; specifically, in Manila,\r\nthe capitol.\r\n\r\n_azotea_: The flat roof of a house or any similar platform;\r\na roof-garden.\r\n\r\n_babaye_: Woman (the general Malay term).\r\n\r\n_baguio_: The local name for the typhoon or hurricane.\r\n\r\n_bailúhan_: Native dance and feast: from the Spanish _baile_.\r\n\r\n_balete_: The Philippine banyan, a tree sacred in Malay folk-lore.\r\n\r\n_banka_: A dugout canoe with bamboo supports or outriggers.\r\n\r\n_Bilibid_: The general penitentiary at Manila.\r\n\r\n_buyo_: The masticatory prepared by wrapping a piece of areca-nut\r\nwith a little shell-lime in a betel-leaf: the _pan_ of British India.\r\n\r\n_cabeza de barangay_: Headman and tax collector for a group of about\r\nfifty families, for whose \"tribute\" he was personally responsible.\r\n\r\n_calle_: Street.\r\n\r\n_camisa_: 1.

I believe him to be now\r\nabout thirty-two years old. He is the Indian of most ability among\r\nthose who have written.\"\r\n\r\n[12] From Valenzuela's deposition before the military tribunal,\r\nSeptember sixth, 1896.\r\n\r\n[13] _Capilla_: the Spanish practise is to place a condemned person\r\nfor the twenty-four hours preceding his execution in a _chapel_, or\r\na cell fitted up as such, where he may devote himself to religious\r\nexercises and receive the final ministrations of the Church.\r\n\r\n[14] But even this conclusion is open to doubt: there is no proof\r\nbeyond the unsupported statement of the Jesuits that he made a written\r\nretraction, which was later destroyed, though why a document so\r\ninteresting, and so important in support of their own point of view,\r\nshould not have been preserved furnishes an illuminating commentary\r\non the whole confused affair. The only unofficial witness present was\r\nthe condemned man's sister, and her declaration, that she was at the\r\ntime in such a state of excitement and distress that she is unable to\r\naffirm positively that there was a real marriage ceremony performed,\r\ncan readily be accepted. It must be remembered that the Jesuits were\r\nthemselves under the official and popular ban for the part they had\r\nplayed in Rizal's education and development and that they were seeking\r\nto set themselves right in order to maintain their prestige. Add to\r\nthis the persistent and systematic effort made to destroy every scrap\r\nof record relating to the man--the sole gleam of shame evidenced in\r\nthe impolitic, idiotic, and pusillanimous treatment of him--and the\r\nwhole question becomes such a puzzle that it may just as well be left\r\nin darkness, with a throb of pity for the unfortunate victim caught\r\nin such a maelstrom of panic-stricken passion and selfish intrigue.\r\n\r\n[15] A similar picture is found in the convento at Antipolo.--_Author's\r\nnote_.\r\n\r\n[16] A school of secondary instruction conducted by the Dominican\r\nFathers, by whom it was taken over in 1640. \"It had its first beginning\r\nin the house of a pious Spaniard, called Juan Geronimo Guerrero,\r\nwho had dedicated himself, with Christian piety, to gathering orphan\r\nboys in his house, where he raised, clothed, and sustained them, and\r\ntaught them to read and to write, and much more, to live in the fear\r\nof God.\"--Blair and Robertson, _The Philippine Islands_, Vol. XLV,\r\np. 208.--TR.\r\n\r\n[17] The Dominican friars, whose order was founded by Dominic de\r\nGuzman.--TR.\r\n\r\n[18] In the story mentioned, the three monks were the old Roman god\r\nBacchus and two of his satellites, in the disguise of Franciscan\r\nfriars,--TR.\r\n\r\n[19] According to a note to the Barcelona edition of this novel,\r\nMendieta was a character well known in Manila, doorkeeper at\r\nthe Alcaldía, impresario of children's theaters, director of a\r\nmerry-go-round, etc.--TR.\r\n\r\n[20] See Glossary.\r\n\r\n[21] The \"tobacco monopoly\" was established during the administration\r\nof Basco de Vargas (1778-1787), one of the ablest governors Spain\r\nsent to the Philippines, in order to provide revenue for the local\r\ngovernment and to encourage agricultural development. The operation\r\nof the monopoly, however, soon degenerated into a system of \"graft\"\r\nand petty abuse which bore heartily upon the natives (see Zuñiga's\r\n_Estadismo_), and the abolition of it in 1881 was one of the heroic\r\nefforts made by the Spanish civil administrators to adjust the archaic\r\ncolonial system to the changing conditions in the Archipelago.--TR.\r\n\r\n[22] As a result of his severity in enforcing the payment of sums\r\ndue the royal treasury on account of the galleon trade, in which\r\nthe religious orders were heavily interested, Governor Fernando de\r\nBustillos Bustamente y Rueda met a violent death at the hands of a\r\nmob headed by friars, October 11, 1719.

By reason of her miraculous powers of allaying the storms she was\r\ncarried back and forth in the state galleons on a number of voyages,\r\nuntil in 1672 she was formally installed in a church in the hills\r\nnortheast of Manila, under the care of the Augustinian Fathers. While\r\nher shrine was building she is said to have appeared to the faithful in\r\nthe top of a large breadfruit tree, which is known to the Tagalogs as\r\n\"antipolo\"; hence her name. Hers is the best known and most frequented\r\nshrine in the country, while she disputes with the Holy Child of Cebu\r\nthe glory of being the wealthiest individual in the whole archipelago.\r\n\r\nThere has always existed a pious rivalry between her and the\r\nDominicans' Lady of the Rosary as to which is the patron saint of the\r\nPhilippines, the contest being at times complicated by counterclaims\r\non the part of St. Francis, although the entire question would seem\r\nto have been definitely settled by a royal decree, published about\r\n1650, officially conferring that honorable post upon St. Michael the\r\nArchangel (San Miguel).

Later, on account of alleged\r\nbrutality similar to the incident used here, he was transferred\r\nto the province of Cavite, where, in 1896, he was taken prisoner\r\nby the insurgents and by them made \"bishop\" of their camp.

The\r\nreference to _Maestro Ciruela_ in Spanish is somewhat similar to a\r\nmention in English of Mr. Squeers, of Dotheboys Hall fame.--TR.\r\n\r\n[65] By one of the provisions of a royal decree of December 20,\r\n1863, the _Catecismo de la Doctrina Cristina_, by Gaspar Astete,\r\nwas prescribed as the text-book for primary schools, in the\r\nPhilippines. See Blair and Robertson's _The Philippine Islands_,\r\nVol. XLVI, p. 98; _Census of the Philippine Islands_ (Washington,\r\n1905), p. 584.--TR.\r\n\r\n[66] The municipal police of the old régime. They were thus described\r\nby a Spanish writer, W. E. Retana, in a note to Ventura F. Lopez's\r\n_El Filibustero_ (Madrid, 1893): \"Municipal guards, whose duties are\r\nprincipally rural. Their uniform is a disaster; they go barefoot;\r\non horseback, they hold the reins in the right hand and a lance in\r\nthe left. They are usually good-for-nothing, but to their credit it\r\nmust be said that they do no damage. Lacking military instruction,\r\nprovided with fire-arms of the first part of the century, of which one\r\nin a hundred might go off in case of need, and for other arms bolos,\r\ntalibons, old swords, etc., the cuadrilleros are truly a parody on\r\narmed force.\"--TR.\r\n\r\n[67] Headman and tax-collector of a district, generally including\r\nabout fifty families, for whose annual tribute he was personally\r\nresponsible. The \"barangay\" is a Malay boat of the kind supposed to\r\nhave been used by the first emigrants to the Philippines. Hence, at\r\nfirst, the \"head of a barangay\" meant the leader or chief of a family\r\nor group of families. This office, quite analogous to the old Germanic\r\nor Anglo-Saxon \"head of a hundred,\" was adopted and perpetuated by\r\nthe Spaniards in their system of local administration.--TR.\r\n\r\n[68] The _hermano mayor_ was a person appointed to direct the\r\nceremonies during the fiesta, an appointment carrying with it great\r\nhonor and importance, but also entailing considerable expense,\r\nas the appointee was supposed to furnish a large share of the\r\nentertainments. Hence, the greater the number of _hermanos mayores_\r\nthe more splendid the fiesta,--TR.\r\n\r\n[69] Mt. Makiling is a volcanic cone at the southern end of the Lake\r\nof Bay. At its base is situated the town of Kalamba, the author's\r\nbirthplace.

P., second archbishop of Manila. By royal decree and\r\npapal bull, it became in 1645 the Royal and Pontifical University\r\nof Santo Tomas, and never, during the Spanish régime, got beyond the\r\nThomistic theology in its courses of instruction.--TR.\r\n\r\n[76] Take heed lest you fall!\r\n\r\n[77] Ferdinand and Isabella, the builders of Spain's greatness,\r\nare known in Spanish history as \"Los Reyes Católicos.\"--TR.\r\n\r\n[78] These spectacular performances, known as \"Moro-Moro,\" often\r\ncontinued for several days, consisting principally of noisy combats\r\nbetween Moros and Christians, in which the latter were, of course,\r\ninvariably victorious. Typical sketches of them may be found in\r\nForeman's _The Philippine Islands_, Chap. XXIII, and Stuntz's _The\r\nPhilippines and the Far East_, Chap. III.--TR.\r\n\r\n[79] \"The Willow.\"\r\n\r\n[80] The capital of Laguna Province, not to be confused with the Santa\r\nCruz mentioned before, which is a populous and important district in\r\nthe city of Manila.

The greater part of his\r\nlife was spent in Manila,--in Tondo and in Pandakan, a quaint little\r\nvillage on the south bank of the Pasig, now included in the city,\r\nwhere he appears to have shared the fate largely of poets of other\r\nlands, from suffering \"the pangs of disprized love\" and persecution\r\nby the religious authorities, to seeing himself considered by the\r\npeople about him as a crack-brained dreamer. He was educated in the\r\nDominican school of San Juan de Letran, one of his teachers being Fray\r\nMariano Pilapil, about whose services to humanity there may be some\r\ndifference of opinion on the part of those who have ever resided in\r\nPhilippine towns, since he was the author of the \"Passion Song\" which\r\nenlivens the Lenten evenings. This \"Passion Song,\" however, seems to\r\nhave furnished the model for Baltazar's _Florante_, with the pupil\r\nsurpassing the master, for while it has the subject and characters\r\nof a medieval European romance, the spirit and settings are entirely\r\nMalay. It is written in the peculiar Tagalog verse, in the form of a\r\n_corrido_ or metrical romance, and has been declared by Fray Toribio\r\nMenguella, Rizal himself, and others familiar with Tagalog, to be\r\na work of no mean order, by far the finest and most characteristic\r\ncomposition in that, the richest of the Malay dialects.--TR.\r\n\r\n[82] Every one talks of the fiesta according to the way he fared at it.\r\n\r\n[83] A Spanish prelate, notable for his determined opposition in\r\nthe Constituent Cortes of 1869 to the clause in the new Constitution\r\nproviding for religious liberty.--TR.\r\n\r\n[84] \"Camacho's wedding\" is an episode in _Don Quixote_, wherein a\r\nwealthy man named Camacho is cheated out of his bride after he has\r\nprepared a magnificent wedding-feast.--TR.\r\n\r\n[85] The full dress of the Filipino women, consisting of the _camisa,\r\npañuelo_, and _saya suelta_, the latter a heavy skirt with a long\r\ntrain. The name _mestiza_ is not inappropriate, as well from its\r\ncomposition as its use, since the first two are distinctly native,\r\nantedating the conquest, while the _saya suelta_ was no doubt\r\nintroduced by the Spaniards.\r\n\r\n[86] The nunnery of St. Clara, situated on the Pasig River just east\r\nof Fort Santiago, was founded in 1621 by the Poor Clares, an order of\r\nnuns affiliated with the Franciscans, and was taken under the royal\r\npatronage as the \"Real Monasterio de Santa Clara\" in 1662. It is still\r\nin existence and is perhaps the most curious of all the curious relics\r\nof the Middle Ages in old Manila.--TR.\r\n\r\n[87] The principal character in Calderon de la Barca's _La Vida\r\nes Sueño_. There is also a Tagalog _corrido_, or metrical romance,\r\nwith this title.--TR.\r\n\r\n[88] The Douay version.--TR.\r\n\r\n[89] \"Errare humanum est\": \"To err is human.\"\r\n\r\n[90] To the Philippine Chinese \"d\" and \"l\" look and sound about\r\nthe same.--TR.\r\n\r\n[91] \"Brothers in Christ.\"\r\n\r\n[92] \"Venerable patron saint.\"\r\n\r\n[93] _Muy Reverendo Padre_: Very Reverend Father.\r\n\r\n[94] Very rich landlord. The United States Philippine Commission,\r\nconstituting the government of the Archipelago, paid to the religious\r\norders \"a lump sum of $7,239,000, more or less,\" for the bulk of\r\nthe lands claimed by them. See the _Annual Report of the Philippine\r\nCommission to the Secretary of War_, December 23, 1903.--TR.\r\n\r\n[95] _Cumare_ and _cumpare_ are corruptions of the Spanish _comadre_\r\nand _compadre_, which have an origin analogous to the English \"gossip\"\r\nin its original meaning of \"sponsor in baptism.\" In the Philippines\r\nthese words are used among the simpler folk as familiar forms of\r\naddress, \"friend,\" \"neighbor.\"--TR.\r\n\r\n[96] Dominus vobiscum.\r\n\r\n[97] The Spanish proverb equivalent to the English \"Birds of a feather\r\nflock together.\"--TR.\r\n\r\n[98] For \"filibustero.\"\r\n\r\n[99] _Tarantado_ is a Spanish vulgarism meaning \"blunderhead,\"\r\n\"bungler.\" _Saragate_ (or _zaragate_) is a Mexican provincialism\r\nmeaning \"disturber,\" \"mischief-maker.\"--TR.\r\n\r\n[100] _Vete á la porra_ is a vulgarism almost the same in meaning\r\nand use as the English slang, \"Tell it to the policeman,\" _porra_\r\nbeing the Spanish term for the policeman's \"billy.\"--TR.\r\n\r\n[101] For _sospechoso_, \"a suspicious character.\"--TR.\r\n\r\n[102] _Sanctus Deus_ and _Requiem aeternam_ (so called from their\r\nfirst words) are prayers for the dead.--TR.\r\n\r\n[103] Spanish etiquette requires that the possessor of an object\r\nimmediately offer it to any person who asks about it with the\r\nconventional phrase, \"It is yours.\" Capitan Tiago is rather overdoing\r\nhis Latin refinement.--TR.\r\n\r\n[104] A metrical discourse for a special occasion or in honor of some\r\ndistinguished personage. Padre Zuñiga (_Estadismo_, Chap. III) thus\r\ndescribes one heard by him in Lipa, Batangas, in 1800, on the occasion\r\nof General Alava's visit to that place: \"He who is to recite the _loa_\r\nis seen in the center of the stage dressed as a Spanish cavalier,\r\nreclining in a chair as if asleep, while behind the scenes musicians\r\nsing a lugubrious chant in the vernacular. The sleeper awakes and\r\nshows by signs that he thinks he has heard, or dreamed of hearing, some\r\nvoice. He again disposes himself to sleep, and the chant is repeated\r\nin the same lugubrious tone. Again he awakes, rises, and shows that\r\nhe has heard a voice. This scene is repeated several times, until at\r\nlength he is persuaded that the voice is announcing the arrival of the\r\nhero who is to be eulogized. He then commences to recite his _loa_,\r\ncarrying himself like a clown in a circus, while he sings the praises\r\nof the person in whose honor the fiesta has been arranged. This _loa_,\r\nwhich was in rhetorical verse in a diffuse style suited to the Asiatic\r\ntaste, set forth the general's naval expeditions and the honors he\r\nhad received from the King, concluding with thanks and acknowledgment\r\nof the favor that he had conferred in passing through their town and\r\nvisiting such poor wretches as they. There were not lacking in it\r\nthe wanderings of Ulysses, the journeys of Aristotle, the unfortunate\r\ndeath of Pliny, and other passages from ancient history, which they\r\ndelight in introducing into their stories. All these passages are\r\nusually filled with fables touching upon the marvelous, such as the\r\nfollowing, which merit special notice: of Aristotle it was said that\r\nbeing unable to learn the depth of the sea he threw himself into its\r\nwaves and was drowned, and of Pliny that he leaped into Vesuvius\r\nto investigate the fire within the volcano. In the same way other\r\nhistorical accounts are confused. I believe that these _loas_ were\r\nintroduced by the priests in former times, although the fables with\r\nwhich they abound would seem to offer an objection to this opinion,\r\nas nothing is ever told in them that can be found in the writings\r\nof any European author; still they appear to me to have been suited\r\nto the less critical taste of past centuries. The verses are written\r\nby the natives, among whom there are many poets, this art being less\r\ndifficult in Tagalog than in any other language.\"--TR.\r\n\r\n[105] \"The old man of the village,\" patriarch.--TR.\r\n\r\n[106] The secular name of St. Francis of Assisi, founder of the\r\nFranciscan order.--TR.\r\n\r\n[107] A Spanish official, author of several works relating to the\r\nPhilippines, one of which, _Recuerdos de Filipinas_ (Madrid, 1877 and\r\n1880), a loose series of sketches and impressions giving anything but\r\na complimentary picture of the character and conduct of the Spaniards\r\nin the Islands, and in a rather naive and perhaps unintentional way\r\nthrowing some lurid side-lights on the governmental administration\r\nand the friar régime,--enjoyed the distinction of being officially\r\nprohibited from circulation in the archipelago.--TR.\r\n\r\n[108] \"_Magcanta-ca!_\" \"(You) sing!\"--TR.\r\n\r\n[109] Europea: European woman.--TR.\r\n\r\n[110] In 1527-29 _Alvaro_ de Saavedra led an unsuccessful expedition to\r\ntake possession of the \"Western Isles.\" The name \"Filipina,\" in honor\r\nof the Prince of the Asturias, afterwards Felipe II (Philip II), was\r\nfirst applied to what is probably the present island of Leyte by Ruy\r\nLopez de Villalobos, who led another unsuccessful expedition thither\r\nin 1542-43, this name being later extended to the whole group.--TR.\r\n\r\n[111] A barrio of Tanawan, Batangas, noted for the manufacture of\r\nhorsewhips.--TR.\r\n\r\n[112] The actors named were real persons. Ratia was a Spanish-Filipino\r\nwho acquired quite a reputation not only in Manila but also in\r\nSpain. He died in Manila in 1910.--TR.\r\n\r\n[113] In the year 1879.--_Author's note_.\r\n\r\n[114] A similar incident occurred in Kalamba.--_Author's note_.\r\n\r\n[115] \"The Maid of Saragossa,\" noted for her heroic exploits during\r\nthe siege of that city by the French in 1808-09.--TR.\r\n\r\n[116]  A region in southwestern Spain, including the provinces of\r\nBadajoz and Caceres.--TR.\r\n\r\n[117] Author of a little book of fables in Castilian verse for the\r\nuse of schools. The fable of the young philosopher illustrates the\r\nthought in Pope's well-known lines:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Vice is a monster of so frightful mien,\r\n    As to be hated needs but to be seen;\r\n    Yet seen too oft, familiar with her face,\r\n    We first endure, then pity, then embrace.\"--TR.\r\n\r\n\r\n[118] Bones for those who come late.\r\n\r\n[119] According to Spanish custom, a matron is known by prefixing\r\nher maiden name with _de_ (possessive _of_) to her husband's name.--TR.\r\n\r\n[120] The marble-shop of Rodoreda is still in existence on Calle\r\nCarriedo, Santa Cruz.--TR.\r\n\r\n[121] There is a play on words here, _Campanario_ meaning belfry and\r\n_Torre_ tower.--TR.\r\n\r\n[122] The Roman Catholic decalogue does not contain the commandment\r\nforbidding the worship of \"graven images,\" its second being the\r\nprohibition against \"taking His holy name in vain.\" To make up the ten,\r\nthe commandment against covetousness is divided into two.--TR.\r\n\r\n[123] The famous Virgin of Saragossa, Spain, and patroness of Santa\r\nCruz, Manila.--TR.\r\n\r\n[124] In 1883 the old system of \"tribute\" was abolished and in its\r\nplace a graduated personal tax imposed. The certificate that this\r\ntax had been paid, known as the _cédula personal_, which also served\r\nfor personal identification, could be required at any time or place,\r\nand failure to produce it was cause for summary arrest. It therefore\r\nbecame, in unscrupulous hands, a fruitful source of abuse, since any\r\n\"undesirable\" against whom no specific charge could be brought might\r\nbe put out of the way by this means.--TR.\r\n\r\n[125] Tanawan or Pateros?--_Author's note_. The former is a town in\r\nBatangas Province, the latter a village on the northern shore of the\r\nLake of Bay, in what is now Rizal Province.--TR.\r\n\r\n[126] The Spanish Parliament.--TR.\r\n\r\n[127] _Lásak, talisain_, and _bulik_ are some of the numerous terms\r\nused in the vernacular to describe fighting-cocks.--TR.\r\n\r\n[128] Another form of the corruption of _compadre_, \"friend,\"\r\n\"neighbor.\"--TR.\r\n\r\n[129] It is a superstition of the cockpit that the color of the victor\r\nin the first bout decides the winners for that session: thus, the red\r\nhaving won, the _lásak_, in whose plumage a red color predominates,\r\nshould be the victor in the succeeding bout.--TR.\r\n\r\n[130] The dark swallows will return.\r\n\r\n[131] General Carlos Maria de let Torte y Nava Carrada, the first\r\n\"liberal\" governor of the Philippines, was Captain-General from 1869\r\nto 1871. He issued an amnesty to the outlaws and created the Civil\r\nGuard, largely from among those who surrendered themselves in response\r\nto it.--TR.\r\n\r\n[132] After the conquest (officially designated as the \"pacification\"),\r\nthe Spanish soldiers who had rendered faithful service were allotted\r\ndistricts known as _encomiendas_, generally of about a thousand\r\nnatives each. The _encomendero_ was entitled to the tribute from the\r\npeople in his district and was in return supposed to protect them and\r\nprovide religious instruction. The early friars alleged extortionate\r\ngreed and brutal conduct on the part of the _encomenderos_ and made\r\nvigorous protests in the natives' behalf.--TR.\r\n\r\n[133] Horse and cow.\r\n\r\n[134] Fray Gaspar de San Agustin, O.S.A., who came to the Philippines\r\nin 1668 and died in Manila in 1724, was the author of a history\r\nof the conquest, but his chief claim to immortality comes from a\r\nletter written in 1720 on the character and habits of \"the Indian\r\ninhabitants of these islands,\" a letter which was widely circulated\r\nand which has been extensively used by other writers. In it the\r\nwriter with senile querulousness harped up and down the whole gamut\r\nof abuse in describing and commenting upon the vices of the natives,\r\nvery artlessly revealing the fact in many places, however, that his\r\nobservations were drawn principally from the conduct of the servants\r\nin the conventos and homes of Spaniards. To him in this letter is\r\ndue the credit of giving its wide popularity to the specious couplet:\r\n\r\n\r\n        El bejuco crece             (The rattan thrives\r\n        Donde el indio nace,        Where the Indian lives,)\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich the holy men who delighted in quoting it took as an additional\r\nevidence of the wise dispensation of the God of Nature, rather\r\ninconsistently overlooking its incongruity with the teachings of Him\r\nin whose name they assumed their holy office.\r\n\r\nIt seems somewhat strange that a spiritual father should have written\r\nin such terms about his charges until the fact appears that the letter\r\nwas addressed to an influential friend in Spain for use in opposition\r\nto a proposal to carry out the provisions of the Council of Trent by\r\nturning the parishes in the islands over to the secular, and hence,\r\nnative, clergy. A translation of this bilious tirade, with copious\r\nannotations showing to what a great extent it has been used by other\r\nwriters, appears in Volume XL of Blair and Robertson's _The Philippine\r\nIslands.--_ TR.\r\n\r\n[135] The Colegio de la Inmaculada Concepcion Concordia, situated\r\nnear Santa Ana in the suburbs of Manila, was founded in 1868 for\r\nthe education of native girls, by a pious Spanish-Filipino lady,\r\nwho donated a building and grounds, besides bearing the expense of\r\nbringing out seven Sisters of Charity to take charge of it.--TR.\r\n\r\n[136] The execution of the Filipino priests Burgos, Gomez, and Zamora,\r\nin 1872.--TR.\r\n\r\n[137] The fair day is foretold by the morn.\r\n\r\n[138] _Paracmason_, i.e. freemason.\r\n\r\n[139] Scholastic theologians.--TR.\r\n\r\n[140] And yet it does move!\r\n\r\n[141] I am a man and nothing that concerns humanity do I consider\r\nforeign to me.\r\n\r\n[142] A portion of the closing words of Virgil's third eclogue,\r\nequivalent here to \"Let the curtain drop.\"--TR.\r\n\r\n[143] \"Whatever is hidden will be revealed, nothing will remain\r\nunaccounted for.\" From _Dies Irae_, the hymn in the mass for the dead,\r\nbest known to English readers from the paraphrase of it in Scott's\r\n_Lay of the Last Minstrel_. The lines here quoted were thus metrically\r\ntranslated by Macaulay:\r\n\r\n\r\n            \"What was distant shall be near,\r\n            What was hidden shall be clear.\"--TR.\r\n\r\n\r\n[144] A common nickname. See the Glossary, under _Nicknames.--TR_.\r\n\r\n[145] The Marianas, or Ladrone Islands, were used as a place of\r\nbanishment for political prisoners.--TR.\r\n\r\n[146] \"Evil Omen,\" a nickname applied by the friars to General Joaquin\r\nJovellar, who was governor of the Islands from 1883 to 1885. It fell\r\nto the lot of General Jovellar, a kindly old man, much more soldier\r\nthan administrator, to attempt the introduction of certain salutary\r\nreforms tending toward progress, hence his disfavor with the holy\r\nfathers. The mention of \"General J----\" in the last part of the\r\nepilogue probably refers also to him.--TR.\r\n\r\n[147] A celebrated Italian astronomer, member of the Jesuit Order.

Something of her early history is thus given\r\nby Fray Luis de Jesus in his _Historia_ of the Recollect Order (1681):\r\n\"A very holy image is revered there under the title of Carmen. Although\r\nthat image is small in stature, it is a great and perennial spring\r\nof prodigies for those who invoke her. Our religious took it from\r\nNueva España (Mexico), and even in that very navigation she was able\r\nto make herself known by her miracles .... That most holy image is\r\ndaily frequented with vows, presents, and novenas, thank-offerings\r\nof the many who are daily favored by that queen of the skies.\"--Blair\r\nand Robertson, _The Philippine Islands_, Vol. XXI, p. 195.\r\n\r\n[150] The oldest and most conservative newspaper in Manila at the\r\ntime this work was written.--TR.\r\n\r\n[151] Following closely upon the liberal administration of La Torre,\r\nthere occurred in the Cavite arsenal in 1872 a mutiny which was\r\nconstrued as an incipient rebellion, and for alleged complicity in it\r\nthree native priests, Padres Burgos, Gomez, and Zamora, were garroted,\r\nwhile a number of prominent Manilans were deported.--TR.\r\n\r\n[152] What do I see? ...
