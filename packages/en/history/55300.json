To say that the one thing needful is\r\n     individuality, is not quite enough.

She was a\r\ngreat belle in the days when Robert and Richard Ray and Prescott Hall\r\nwere of the _jeunesse dorée_ of this city. In my opinion, she was the\r\nmost beautiful, Murillo-like woman I have ever seen, and she was as good\r\nas she was beautiful;--an angel in works of charity and sympathy for\r\nher race. Charlotte Corday’s picture in the Louvre is a picture of my\r\nmother. The likeness arose from the fact that her family were descended\r\non the maternal side from the Corday family of France. This also\r\naccounts for all my family being, from time immemorial, good Democrats.\r\nNo one was too humble to be received and cared for and sympathized with\r\nby my mother. Her pastime was by the bedside of hospital patients, and\r\nin the schoolroom of her children. She followed the precepts of her\r\nmother’s great-grandfather, the Rev. Gabriel Marion (grandfather of Gen.\r\nFrancis Marion) as expressed in his will to the following effect: “As to\r\nthe poor, I have always treated them as my brethren. My dear family\r\nwill, I know, follow my example.” It also contained this item: “I give\r\nher, my wife, my new carriage and horses, that she may visit her friends\r\nin comfort.” This ancestor came from Rochelle in a large ship chartered\r\nfor the Carolinas by several wealthy Huguenot families. The Hugers and\r\nTrapiers and others came over in the same ship. He did not leave France\r\nempty-handed, for on his arrival in Carolina he bought a plantation on\r\nGoose Creek, near Charleston, where he was buried.\r\n\r\nWhile a belle in this city her admirers were legion, until a young\r\nGeorgian, in the person of my father, stepped in, and secured the prize\r\nand took her off to Savannah. He was fresh from Princeton College, cut\r\nshort in his college career by a large fire in Savannah (his native\r\ncity), which burnt it down, destroying my grandfather’s city property.\r\nThe old gentleman, when the fire occurred, refused to leave his\r\nresidence (now the Pulaski Hotel), and was taken forcibly from the\r\nburning building in his chair. He then owned the valuable business\r\nportion of the city, and at once went to work to rebuild. His relatives\r\nwould not assist him, and so he sent for his only son, then at college,\r\nand got him to indorse all his notes, and in this way secured from the\r\nbanks the money he wanted for building purposes. He undertook too much,\r\nand my father bore for one-third of his life a burden of debt then\r\nincurred. Nothing daunted, he went to work at the bar and commenced life\r\nwith his beautiful, young Northern wife.\r\n\r\nAt that time, there was a great prejudice against Northern people. My\r\nfather’s mother never forgave my mother for being a Northern woman, and\r\nwhen she died, though she knew her son was weighed down with his\r\nfather’s debts, insisted on his freeing all the negroes she owned and\r\nleft him by will, enjoining him to do this as her last dying request. It\r\nis needless to say that he did it, and not only this, but became the\r\nguardian of those people and helped and cared for them so long as he\r\nlived. Being repeatedly Mayor of the City of Savannah, he was able to\r\nprotect them, and so devoted were the whole colored population to him,\r\nthat one Andrew Marshall, the clergyman of the largest colored church\r\nin the city of Savannah, offered up prayers for him on every Sunday, as\r\nis done in our Episcopal church for the President of the United States.\r\nBlest with five sons and one daughter, struggling to maintain them by\r\nhis practice at the bar, this best of fathers sent his family North\r\nevery summer, with one or two exceptions, to Newport, R. I., which at\r\nthat time was really a Southern colony.\r\n\r\nIt was the fashion then at Newport to lease for the summer a farmer’s\r\nhouse on the Island, and not live in the town. Well do I remember, with\r\nmy Uncle Sam Ward and Dr. Francis, of New York, and my father, building\r\nbonfires on Paradise Rocks on the Fourth of July and flying kites from\r\nPurgatory. The first relief to this hard-worked man was sending his\r\noldest son to West Point, where, I will here add, he did the family\r\ngreat credit by becoming, being, and dying a noble soldier and\r\nChristian. Fighting in both armies, one may say, though I believe he was\r\nin active service only in the Mexican War, having graduated second in\r\nhis class at West Point and entered the Ordnance Corps; so in place of\r\nfighting, he was making arms, casting cannon, etc. His pride lay in the\r\nfact that he was a soldier. His last request was that the Secretary of\r\nWar should grant permission for his remains to be buried at West Point,\r\nwhich request was granted. My second brother, Hall, grew up with the\r\npoet Milton always under his arm. He was a great student. At the little\r\nvillage of Springfield, Georgia, where my family had a country house,\r\nand where we occasionally passed the summer in the piney woods, I\r\nremember as a boy of fifteen years of age, reading the Declaration of\r\nIndependence on the Fourth of July from the pulpit of the village church\r\nto the descendants of the old Salzburghers, who came over soon after\r\nOglethorpe, and it was before an audience of these piney woods farmers,\r\nthat, with this brother, at a meeting of our Debating Society in this\r\nvillage, I discussed the question, “Which is the stronger passion, Love\r\nor Ambition,” he advocating Ambition, I Love. I well remember going for\r\nhim, as follows: “If his motto be that of Hercules the Invincible, I\r\nassume for mine that of his opponent, Venus the Victorious. With my\r\nsling and stone I will enter this unequal combat and thus hope to slay\r\nthe great Goliath.” The twelve good and true men who heard the\r\ndiscussion decided in my favor. To the end of his days this brother of\r\nmine was guided and governed by this self-same ambition; it made him\r\nwhat he became, a great lawyer, the lawyer of the Pacific coast; his\r\nboast to me being that he had saved seventeen lives, never having lost a\r\nmurder case. I let ambition go, and through life and to the present\r\nmoment swear by my goddess Venus. This brother, after entering the\r\nGeorgia bar, started for a trip around the world. On reaching San\r\nFrancisco he heard of the discovery of gold, and Commodore Jones, then\r\nin command of our Pacific Squadron, urged him to prosecute some sailors\r\nwho had thrown an officer overboard and deserted, and it was this which\r\ncaused him to settle down there to the practice of law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAW AND HOUSEKEEPING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n     _My New York Life--A Penurious Aunt who Fed me on Turkey--My First\r\n     Fancy Ball--Spending One Thousand Dollars for a Costume--The\r\n     Schermerhorns give a Ball in Great Jones Street--Sticking a Man’s\r\n     Calf and Drawing Blood--A Craze for Dancing--I Study\r\n     Law--Blackstone has a Rival in Lovely Southern Maidens--I go to San\r\n     Francisco in ’50--Fees Paid in Gold Dust--Eggs at $2--My First\r\n     Housekeeping--A faux pas at a Reception._\r\n\r\n\r\nI myself soon left Savannah for New York after Hall’s departure,\r\nresiding there in Tenth Street with an old maiden lady, my relative and\r\ngodmother, whom I always felt would endow me with all her worldly goods,\r\nbut who, I regret to say, preferred the Presbyterian church and the\r\nGeorgia Historical Society to myself, for between them she divided a\r\nmillion. At that time Tenth Street was a fashionable street; our house\r\nwas a comfortable, ordinary one, but my ancient relative considered it a\r\npalace, so that all her visitors were taken from garret to cellar to\r\nview it. Occupying the front room in the third story, as I would hear\r\nthese visitors making for my room, I often had to scramble into the\r\nbath-room or under the bed, to hide myself. Having a large fortune, my\r\nrelative, whom I called Aunt (but who was really only my father’s\r\ncousin), was saving to meanness; her plantations in the South furnished\r\nour table; turkeys came on in barrels. “It was turkey hot and turkey\r\ncold, turkey tender, and turkey tough, until at grace one would exclaim,\r\n‘I thank ye, Lord, we’ve had enough.’” As the supposed heir of my saving\r\ngodmother, the portals of New York society were easily open to me, and I\r\nwell remember my first fancy ball, given by Mrs. John C. Stevens in her\r\nresidence in College Place. A company of soldiers were called in to\r\ndrill on the waxed floors to perfect them for dancing. A legacy of a\r\nthousand dollars paid me by the New York Life Insurance and Trust\r\nCompany I expended in a fancy dress, which I flattered myself was the\r\nhandsomest and richest at the ball. I danced the cotillion with a nun, a\r\nstrange costume for her to appear in, as “I wont be a nun” was engraved\r\non every expression of her face. She was at that day one of the\r\nbrightest and most charming young women in this city, and had a power of\r\nfascination rarely equaled.\r\n\r\nThe next great social event that I recall was the great fancy ball given\r\nby the Schermerhorns in their house on the corner of Great Jones Street\r\nand Lafayette Place. All the guests were asked to appear in the costume\r\nof the period of Louis XV. The house itself was furnished and decorated\r\nin that style for this occasion. No pains or expense were spared. It was\r\nintended to be the greatest _affaire de luxe_ New Yorkers had ever seen.\r\nThe men, as well as the women, vied with each other in getting up as\r\nhandsome costumes as were ever worn at that luxurious Court. The lace\r\nand diamonds on the women astonished society. All the servants of the\r\nhouse wore costumes, correct copies of those worn at that period. The\r\nmen in tights and silk stockings, for the first time in their lives,\r\nbecame jealous of each other’s calves, and in one instance, a friend of\r\nmine, on gazing at the superb development in this line of a guest,\r\ndoubted nature’s having bestowed such generous gifts on him; so, to\r\nsatisfy himself, he pricked his neighbor’s calf with his sword, actually\r\ndrawing blood, but the possessor of the fine limbs never winced; later\r\non he expressed forcibly his opinion of the assault. By not wincing the\r\nimpression that he had aided nature was confirmed.\r\n\r\nThese two balls were the greatest social events that had ever occurred\r\nin this city. Even then subscription balls were the fashion. One of the\r\nmost brilliant was given at Delmonico’s on the corner of Beaver and\r\nWilliam streets (the old building in which the ball was given is now\r\nbeing torn down). Saracco’s dancing-rooms were then much resorted to.\r\nThey became the rage, and every one was seized with a desire to perfect\r\nhimself in dancing.\r\n\r\nDisgusted with book-keeping, I resolved to study law, and knowing that I\r\ncould not do much studying whilst flirting and going to balls and\r\ndinners, I went South to my native city, took up the second volume of\r\nBlackstone, committed it to memory, passed an examination, and was\r\nadmitted to the bar by one of our ex-ministers to Austria, then a judge.\r\n\r\nBlackstone did not wholly absorb all my time that winter. I exercised my\r\nmemory in the morning and indulged my imagination of an afternoon,\r\nbreathing soft words to lovely Southern maidens, in the piney groves\r\nwhich surround that charming city. From time immemorial they had always\r\ngiven these on Valentine’s Eve a Valentine party. I was tempted to go to\r\nthe one given that year. And as I entered the house a basketful of\r\nsealed envelopes was handed me, one of which I took; on breaking the\r\nseal, I found on the card the name of a brilliant, charming young woman,\r\nwhom I then had a right to claim as my partner for the evening, but to\r\nwhom I must bend the knee, and express interest and devotion to her in a\r\nspecies of poetical rhapsody. As all the young men were to go through\r\nthe same ordeal, it was less embarrassing. From the time of entering the\r\nball-room until the late hour at which supper was served, the guests in\r\nthe crowded rooms were laughing over the sight of each young man\r\ndropping on one knee before his partner and presenting her with a\r\nbouquet of flowers, and in low and tender words pouring out his soul in\r\npoetry. When it came my turn, I secured a cushion and down I went, the\r\nyoung woman laughing immoderately; but I, not in the least perturbed,\r\ngrasping my bouquet of flowers with one hand and placing my other hand\r\nover my heart, looking into the depths of her lovely eyes, addressed to\r\nher these words:\r\n\r\n    “These flowers, dear lady, unto thee I bring,\r\n       With hopes as timid as the dawning spring,\r\n     Which oft repelled by many a chilling blast\r\n       Still trusts its offerings may succeed at last.\r\n\r\n     Receive thou, emblem of the rosy spring,\r\n       Charmer of life, of every earthly thing,\r\n     These flowers, which lovely as the tints of morn\r\n       Yet ne’er can hope thy beauty to adorn.\r\n\r\n     Oh, may they plead for one who never knew\r\n       Perfection’s image till he met with you;\r\n     Oh, may their fragrance to thy heart convey\r\n       How much he would, but does not dare to say.”\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, while I was dancing and reciting poetry to beautiful\r\nwomen, my generous brother was rapidly making money at the bar in San\r\nFrancisco, and urging my father and me to leave Georgia and go to him,\r\nwriting that he was making more money in two months’ practice than my\r\nfather received in a year. This to my conservative parent seemed\r\nincredible; he shook his head, saying to me, “It is hard for an old tree\r\nto take root in a new soil.” His friends of the Savannah bar ridiculed\r\nhis entertaining the notion of leaving Georgia, where his father had\r\nbeen a Judge of the Superior Court of that State; he himself had been\r\nUnited States District Attorney, for years had presided over the Georgia\r\nSenate, had been nominated for Governor of the State, and for a lifetime\r\nhad been at the head of the Georgia bar. Always a Union man, opposing\r\nNullification, he was beloved by the people of his State, and his law\r\npractice was then most lucrative. The idea of his pulling up stakes and\r\ngoing to the outposts of civilization seemed absurd. He would not\r\nentertain the thought; he laughed at my brother’s Arabian Nights stories\r\nof his law firm in San Francisco making money at the rate of $100,000 a\r\nyear. But just here, my father’s purpose was suddenly shaken, by my\r\nbrother’s remitting to me a large amount of money in gold dust, and he,\r\nmy father, being then paid five thousand dollars by the Bank of the\r\nState of Georgia for an argument made for them before the United States\r\nSupreme Court at Washington. My gold dust was tangible evidence of my\r\nbrother’s success, and as continual dropping wears away a stone, so by\r\ncontinual pleading I at last persuaded him to take me to California.\r\nMournfully he sold our old homestead and sadly closed up his Savannah\r\nlaw office, and with me, on the 13th of May, 1850, left for San\r\nFrancisco, where in two years he made a comfortable fortune, retired\r\nfrom practice and went to Europe. My brother Hall’s motto was, “Ten\r\nmillions or nothing.” He made himself, to my certain knowledge, two\r\ncomfortable fortunes. Grand speculations to double my father’s fortune\r\nvery soon made inroads in it, and the dear old gentleman to save a\r\nremnant returned to this country. As he expressed himself to me,\r\n“California must have a Circuit Judge of the United States. I will get\r\nour Democratic Congress to pass a bill to this effect, and will myself\r\nreturn to California as its United States Circuit Judge. I do not care\r\nto return to the practice of law when I reach San Francisco, where, I\r\nexpect to find that, like the ‘fruit of the Dead Sea,’ my little\r\ncompetency will turn into ashes at the touch. Being on the Bench, I\r\nshall at least have a support”; all of which he carried out to the\r\nletter, and he died devoted to the people of the State of California.\r\n\r\nImagine me then, a well-fed man, with always an appreciative appetite,\r\nlearning, on my arrival in San Francisco, that eggs, without which I\r\ncould not breakfast, cost $2 apiece, a fowl $8, a turkey $16. One week’s\r\nmess bill for my breakfast and dinner alone was $225, and one visit to\r\nmy doctor cost me $50. Gloom settled upon me, until my noble parent\r\nrequested me to bring back to the office our first retainer (for I was\r\nthen a member of my father and brother’s law firm). It was $4000 in gold\r\nounces. I put it in a bag and lugged it to the office, and as I laid\r\nthem ounce by ounce on my father’s desk, he danced a pirouette, for he\r\nwas as jolly an old fellow as ever lived. I went to work at once in\r\nearnest; it struck me that in that country it was “root, pig, or die.”\r\n\r\nMy first purchase was a desk, which combined the qualities of bed and\r\ndesk. How well I remember the rats playing hide-and-seek over me at\r\nnight, and over the large barrel of English Brown Stout that I invested\r\nin and placed in the entry to console myself with. After six months’\r\nhard work, I began to ease up, and feel rich. I built a small house for\r\nmyself, the front entry 4 × 4, the back entry the same, one dining-room\r\n12 × 14, and one bedroom, same dimensions. My furniture, just from\r\nParis, was acajou and white and blue horsehair. My bed-quilt cost me\r\n$250; it was a lovely Chinese floss silk shawl. An Indian chief, calling\r\nto see me, found me in bed, and was so delighted with the blankets that\r\nhe seized hold of them and exclaimed, “_Quanto pesos?_” (How much did\r\nthey cost?)\r\n\r\nMy first row as a householder was with my neighbor, a Texan. I found my\r\nyard fence, if put up, would close up the windows and front door of his\r\nhouse. We had an interview. He, with strong adjectives, assured me that\r\nhe would blow out my brains if I put up that fence. I asked him in\r\nreply, where he kept his private burying ground. All men then went armed\r\nday and night. For two years I slept with a revolver under my pillow.\r\nWith a strong force of men the next day, I put up the fence, and the\r\nTexan moved out and sold his lot. As our firm was then making $100,000 a\r\nyear, our senior partner, my father, asked me to entertain, for the\r\nfirm, our distinguished European clients, as he himself had not the time\r\nto do so. His injunction to me was, “Be sure, my boy, that you always\r\ninvite nice people.” I had heard that my dear old father had on more\r\nthan one occasion gotten off a witticism on me as follows: Being told\r\nhow well his son kept house, he replied, “Yes, he keeps everything but\r\nthe Ten Commandments,” so I assured him if he would honor me with his\r\npresence I would have to meet him every respectable woman in the city,\r\nand I kept my word. Before we reached the turkey, my guests had so\r\nthoroughly dined that when it appeared, the handsomest woman in the room\r\nheaved a deep sigh and exclaimed, “Oh, that I might have some of it for\r\nlunch to-morrow!” Such dinners as I then gave, I have never seen\r\nsurpassed anywhere. It is needless to say that my father was intensely\r\ngratified. We had, tempted by exaggerated accounts of the gold fields,\r\nFrench cooks who received $6000 a year as salary. The turkey, costly as\r\nit was at $16, always came on table with its feathered tail intact, and\r\nas eggs were so expensive, _omelette soufflée_ was always the dish at\r\ndessert. Two years was the length of my stay in San Francisco.\r\n\r\nOn reaching New York in 1852, from California, I found great objection\r\nmade to my return there as a married man, and gracefully yielded to\r\ncircumstances. Though loath to give up my profession of the law, I was\r\nforced to make this sacrifice; so the moment I concluded to give up\r\nCalifornia and the legal profession, not wishing to be idle, I went to\r\nWashington and applied to the President for the position of Secretary of\r\nLegation in England. The Georgia, South Carolina, Virginia, and\r\nCalifornia delegations urged me for this appointment; Mr. Buchanan was\r\ngoing to England as Minister. He was a warm friend of my father’s, and,\r\nwhen approached, expressed not only willingness but gratification at\r\nhaving the son of an old friend as his Secretary of Legation, and I was\r\nto have had the position. But just at this time, my father, who had\r\nreturned from Europe, wished to obtain from President Pierce the\r\nappointment of Circuit Judge of the United States for the State of\r\nCalifornia. He came to me and stated the case as follows: “My boy,” he\r\nsaid, “the President says he cannot give two appointments to one family.\r\nIf you go to England as Buchanan’s Secretary, President Pierce cannot\r\nmake me Circuit Judge of California.” “Enough said,” I replied, “I yield\r\nwith pleasure. I will go abroad, but not in the diplomatic service.”\r\nPassing the winter in Washington, I soon learned how to ingratiate\r\nmyself with the law-makers of our country. Good dinners and wine were\r\nalways effective. And as I had the friendship of the California, New\r\nYork and Southern delegations, I was dining out all the time, invited by\r\none man or other who had an axe to grind. On these occasions, there was\r\nalways a room prepared to receive a guest who had indulged too freely in\r\nstrong waters. Men then drank in good earnest, a striking contrast to\r\nthe days in which we now live, when really, at dinner, people only taste\r\nwine, but do not drink it. I was then placed on the Committee of\r\nManagement for the Inaugural Ball, and did good service and learned much\r\nfrom my Washington winter.\r\n\r\nAn amusing incident I must here relate. Quietly breakfasting and\r\nchatting with a beautiful woman, then a bride, who had lived for years\r\nin Washington as a widow, she asked me if I was going to Corcoran’s\r\nball that evening, and on my replying, “Yes, of course I was,” she\r\nrequested me to accompany her husband and self, which I did. On entering\r\nMr. Corcoran’s ball room with her on my arm, I noticed that the old\r\ngentleman bowed very stiffly to us; however, I paid no attention to this\r\nand went on dancing, and escorting through the rooms my fair partner,\r\nfrom whom I had no sooner been separated than my host slapped me on the\r\nshoulder with, “My dear young man, I know you did not know it, but the\r\nlady you have just had on your arm is not only not a guest of mine, but\r\nthis morning I positively refused to send her an invitation to this\r\nball.” Fortunately I had brought letters to this distinguished man, so\r\nseeing my annoyance, he patted me on the shoulder and said, “My boy,\r\nthis is not an unusual occurrence in this city; but let it be a warning\r\nto you to take care hereafter whom you bring to a friend’s house.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION TO LONDON SPORTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n     _Introduction to London Sports--A Dog Fight in the\r\n     Suburbs--Sporting Ladies--The Drawing of the Badger--My Host gets\r\n     Gloriously Drunk--Visit to Her Majesty’s Kitchen--Dinner with the\r\n     Chef of Windsor Castle--I taste Mantilla Sherry for the First\r\n     Time--“A Shilling to Pay for the ‘Times.’”_\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter my marriage I took up my residence in Newport, buying a farm on\r\nNarragansett Bay and turning farmer in good earnest. I planted out\r\n10,000 trees on that farm and then went to Europe to let them grow,\r\nexpecting a forest on my return, but I found only one of them struggling\r\nfor existence three years later. In London, I met a Californian, in with\r\nall the sporting world, on intimate terms with the champion\r\nprize-fighter of England, the Queen’s pages, Tattersall’s and others. He\r\nsuggested that if I would defray the expense, he would show me London as\r\nno American had ever seen it. Agreeing to do this, I was taken to a\r\nswell tailor in Regent Street, to put me, as he expressed it, “in proper\r\nrig.” My first introduction to London life was dining out in the suburbs\r\nto see a dog-fight, and sup at a Regent Street dry-goods merchant’s\r\nresidence. I was introduced as an American landed proprietor. Mine host,\r\nI was told, spent twelve thousand pounds, i.e. $60,000 a year, on his\r\nestablishment. He was an enthusiast in his way, an old sport. The women\r\nwhom I was invited to meet looked like six-footers; the hall of the\r\nhouse and the sitting-rooms were filled with stuffed bull-terriers,\r\nprize dogs, that had done good service. We walked through beautifully\r\nlaid-out grounds to a miniature ornamental villa which contained a rat\r\npit, and there we saw a contest between what seemed to me a myriad of\r\nrats and a bull-terrier. The latter’s work was expeditious. We\r\nsurrounded the pit, each one with his watch in hand timing the dog’s\r\nwork, which he easily accomplished in the allotted time, killing all the\r\nrats, which called forth great applause. From this pit we went to\r\nanother, where we saw the drawing of the badger, a very amusing sight.\r\nThere was a long narrow box with a trap-door, by which the badger was\r\nshut in; up went the door, in went the terrier; he seized the badger by\r\nthe ear and pulled him out of his box and around the pit, the badger\r\nheld back with all his might; should the dog fail to catch the badger by\r\nthe ear, the badger would kill him. Again, we assembled around a third\r\npit, to see a dog-fight, and saw fight after fight between these\r\nbull-terriers, to me a disgusting sight, but the women shouted with\r\ndelight, and kept incessantly calling “Time, sir; time, sir!” Large bets\r\nwere made on the result. At midnight we went to supper. I sat next to\r\nthe champion prize-fighter of England, who informed me that a countryman\r\nof mine had died in his arms after a prize-fight. Such drinking I never\r\nsaw before or since; the host, calling for bumper after bumper, insisted\r\non every one draining his glass. I skillfully threw my wine under the\r\ntable. The host and all the company were soon intoxicated. The footmen\r\nin green and gold liveries never cracked a smile. The master, after a\r\nbumper, would fall forward on the table, smashing everything. His butler\r\npicked him up and replaced him in his chair. This was kept up until 3\r\nA.M., when with pleasure I slipped out and was off in my hansom for\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nMy visit to Windsor Castle, dining at the village inn with Her Majesty’s\r\n_chef_, and the keeper of her jewel room, was interesting. I saw the\r\nold, tall doorkeeper, with his long staff, sitting at the door of the\r\nservants’ hall. I saw Her Majesty’s kitchen and the roasts for all\r\nliving in the castle,--at least twenty separate pieces turning on a\r\nspit. Then I examined a large, hot, steel table on which any cooked\r\narticle being placed would stay hot as long as it remained there. The\r\n_chef_ told me a German prince, when informed of its price, said it\r\nwould take all his yearly revenue to pay for it. Then I saw Her\r\nMajesty’s jewel room; the walls wainscoted, as it were, with gold\r\nplates; the large gold bowl, which looks like a small bath-tub, from\r\nwhich the Prince of Wales was baptized, stood in the dining-room. I saw\r\nPrince Albert and the Prince of Wales that morning shooting pheasants,\r\nalongside of the Windsor Long Walk, and stood within a few yards of\r\nthem. I feel sure we ate, that day, at the inn, the pheasants that had\r\nbeen shot by Prince Albert. I visited Her Majesty’s model farm, and\r\nfound that all the flax-seed cake for the cattle was imported from\r\nAmerica. The simple cognomen, American Landed Proprietor, was “open\r\nsesame” to me everywhere, accompanied as I was by one of her Majesty’s\r\npages. In London, of an evening, we went to Evans’s, a sort of public\r\nhall where one took beer and listened to comic songs. Jubber, a wine\r\nmerchant, kept the hotel where I lodged. As a celebrated London\r\nphysician was dining with me, I asked for the palest and most delicate\r\nsherry to be found in London, regardless of cost, to be served that day,\r\nat my dinner. He looked at me and smiled, seeing I was quite a young\r\nman, saying, “If I give it to you, you will not drink it.” “Send me the\r\nsherry,” I replied, “and you will see.” The result was I got a delicious\r\nMontilla sherry and sent a butt of it to America. This was my first\r\nacquaintance with Montilla sherry, the most delicate wine that I know\r\nof, to be served from soup to dessert.\r\n\r\nBefore getting through with my sporting friend, after paying all his\r\nexpenses and remunerating him liberally for his services, as I was about\r\nto cross the Channel, he came up to me and said, “Mc, I want you to lend\r\nme some money.” I saw by his face he was in earnest, and thought that he\r\nwas about to make a demand for a large amount. So, equally serious, I\r\nreplied, “It is out of the question, my dear fellow; I am here in a\r\nstrange country with my family and have no money to lend.” He roared,\r\n“Why, all I wanted was a shilling to pay for the _Times_,” which made me\r\nfeel very sheepish. That was the last I saw of him. When two years later\r\nI returned to London, I found he had conscientiously paid no bills, and,\r\nstrange to relate, his hotel keeper and tailors seemed fully compensated\r\nfor the food and raiment they had furnished him, by his sending them a\r\nfew valueless colored plates of sporting scenes in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA WINTER IN ITALY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n     _A Winter in Florence and Rome--Cheap Living and Good\r\n     Cooking--Walnut-fed Turkeys--The Grand Duke of Tuscany’s Ball--An\r\n     American Girl who Elbowed the King--What a Ball Supper Should\r\n     be--Ball to the Archduke of Tuscany--“The Duke of\r\n     Pennsylvania”--Following the Hounds on the Campagna--The American\r\n     Minister Snubs American Gentlemen._\r\n\r\n\r\nI landed in France, not knowing how to speak the language, and only\r\nremembering a few French words learned in childhood. It was the year of\r\nthe Paris Exposition of 1857; all the hotels were full. The Meurice\r\nHotel people sent me off to a neighboring house, where we lodged in the\r\nninth story. I saw the baptism of the Prince Imperial, and on that\r\noccasion, and later on in Rome, at the Carnival, saw the handsomest\r\nwomen I had yet seen in Europe. We then made for Florence, and there,\r\ngetting a most captivating little apartment, on the Arno, kept house,\r\nand if it had not been for the terrible and incessant winds called the\r\n_tramontana_ would probably have passed our days there. I had the most\r\nadmirable cook, and had never lived as well. Then the economy of the\r\nthing; it cost nothing to live. I paid the fellow twenty-four pauls\r\n($2.40) a day. For this sum he gave us breakfast and exquisite dinners.\r\nFor each extra guest, at dinner, I paid a few pauls; if I gave a dinner\r\nparty he hired for me as handsome a service of silver plate as I have\r\never seen. His whole kitchen seemed to consist of half a dozen pots and\r\npans, and everything was cooked by charcoal.\r\n\r\nHis manner of roasting a turkey was indeed novel; he placed his bird on\r\na spit, put it in an iron pot, covered it with hot coals top and bottom,\r\nand then kept turning the spit incessantly and basting the bird. Such a\r\nperfect roast I have never before or since eaten. I shall speak later on\r\nof the Newport turkey and the Southern barnyard-fed turkey, but they are\r\nnot a circumstance to the Florentine walnut-fed turkey. In Florence, at\r\nthe markets, all turkeys and fowls were cut up and sold, not as a whole,\r\nbut piece by piece. For instance, you saw on the marble slabs the\r\nbreasts of chickens, the wings of chickens, the legs of chickens; the\r\nsame with turkeys. To get an entire bird, you had to order him ahead, so\r\nthat a few days before Christmas, as we came home from our drive, we\r\nfound a superb turkey strutting through the drawing-room, the largest\r\ncreature I had ever seen, weighing twenty-five pounds. When he was\r\nserved, the walnuts he had eaten could be seen all over his back in\r\nlarge, round yellow spots of fat. As he came on the table, he was indeed\r\na sight to behold; the skin, as it were, mahogany color and crisp, his\r\nflesh partaking of the flavor of the walnut, would have satisfied\r\nLucullus.\r\n\r\nAt that period I worshipped doctors; my theory then was that you owed\r\nyour existence to them, that they kept you in the world, and not to\r\nhave a doctor within call was to place yourself in danger of immediate\r\nand sudden death; so the first man I cultivated in Florence was the\r\nEnglish doctor. He came to see me every day; it was indeed a luxury; his\r\nfee was two dollars. We became great friends, and as he was the Court\r\nphysician, he got me invitations to all the balls. The Grand Duke of\r\nTuscany, then the richest sovereign in Europe, gave a ball every\r\nfortnight at the Pitti Palace. It was said that the Italians lived on\r\nchestnuts and air between these suppers, and, like the bear, laid in\r\nsuch a supply of food at them as comfortably to carry them through from\r\none entertainment to the other. Certainly such feasting I had never\r\nbefore seen. The number of rooms thrown open really confused one, it was\r\nhard not to lose one’s way. All the guests were assembled, and grouped\r\nin the form of a circle, in the largest of these salons, when the grand\r\nducal party entered. The minister of each foreign country stood at the\r\nhead of his little band of countrymen and countrywomen who were to be\r\npresented. The Grand Duke, Archduke, and suite passed from group to\r\ngroup. The presentation over, the ball began in earnest. All waited\r\nuntil the Archduke started in the dance, and as he waltzed by you, you\r\nfollowed. When he stopped dancing, all stopped.\r\n\r\nI remember, at one of these balls, dancing with an American girl, a\r\nstrikingly handsome woman, a great Stonington belle. As we waltzed by\r\nthe King of Bavaria, I felt a hand placed on my shoulder, and a voice\r\nexclaimed, “_Mais, Monsieur, c’est le roi_”; I stopped at once, and\r\nhastily inquired of my fair partner, “What is it?” She replied, “I did\r\nit, I was determined to do it. As I passed the King I punched him in the\r\nribs with my elbow. Now I am satisfied.” I rushed up to the King and\r\nGrand Chamberlain, saying, “_Mille pardons, mille pardons_,” and the\r\naffair passed over, but I soon disposed of the young woman and never\r\n“attempted her again.” The diamonds the women wore amazed me. You see\r\nnothing in this country like the tiaras of diamonds I saw at this ball;\r\ntiara after tiara, the whole head blazing with diamonds, and yet there\r\nwas but little beauty.\r\n\r\nIt was here that I first learned what a ball supper should be, and what\r\nwere the proper mural decorations for a ball-room and the halls opening\r\ninto it. The supper system was perfect. In one salon, large tables for\r\ncoffee, tea, chocolate, and cakes. In another, tables covered simply\r\nwith ices and other light refreshments, _foie gras_, sandwiches, etc. In\r\nthe grand supper room, the whole of the wall of one side of the room,\r\nfrom floor almost to ceiling, was covered with shelves, on which every\r\nimaginable dish was placed, hot and cold. The table in front of these\r\nshelves was lined with servants in livery, and simply loaded with empty\r\nplates and napkins to serve the supper on. The favorite and most prized\r\ndishes at all these suppers was cold sturgeon (a fish we never eat), and\r\nthe most prized fruit the hot-house pineapple, with all its leaves, and\r\nto the eye seemingly growing. Opposite the supper table, in another part\r\nof the room, the wines were served, all by themselves, and there was, it\r\nappears to me, every wine grown in any quarter of the globe. Everything\r\nwas abundant and lavish, and the whole affair was most imposing.\r\n\r\nThat winter the Archduke of Tuscany married one of the princesses of\r\nBavaria, and the Austrian Minister gave them a ball, which I attended.\r\nThe effect produced in approaching his palace, all the streets\r\nilluminated by immense flaring torches attached to the house, was grand.\r\nThe ball-room was superb. From the ceiling hung, not one or two, but\r\nliterally fifty or more chandeliers of glass, with long prisms dangling\r\nfrom them. The women were not handsome, but what most struck me was the\r\nfreshness of their toilets. They all looked new, as if made for the\r\noccasion; not so elaborate, but so fresh and light and delicate. I\r\nnoticed that the royal party supped in a room by themselves, always\r\nattended by their host.\r\n\r\nAs I was strolling through the rooms, my host, the Austrian Minister,\r\napproached me and said, “I see I have another American as a guest\r\nto-night, and he is decorated. Will you kindly tell me what his\r\ndecoration is?” “I really do not know,” I replied; “I will present\r\nmyself to him and ask.”\r\n\r\nWe approached my countryman together, and, after a few words, the\r\nminister most courteously put the question to him. He drew himself up\r\nand said, “Sir, my country is a Republic; if it had been a Monarchy, I\r\nwould have been the Duke of Pennsylvania. The Order I wear is that of\r\nThe Cincinnati.” The minister, deeply impressed, withdrew, and I\r\nintensely enjoyed the little scene.\r\n\r\nAfter the great works of art, what most impressed me in Florence were\r\nthe immense, orderly crowds seen on all public occasions, a living mass\r\nof humanity, as far as the eye could see. No jostling or shoving, but\r\nhuman beings filling up every inch of space between the carriage wheels,\r\nas our horses, on a walk, dragged our carriage through them.\r\n\r\nThe most charming spot on earth for the last of winter and the spring\r\nmonths is the city of Rome. We went there under most favorable\r\ncircumstances. A kind friend had leased an apartment for us in the Via\r\nGregoriana, and we found Rome full of the _crême de la crême_ of New\r\nYork society. In Nazzari we had another Delmonico, and we kept dining\r\nand wining each other daily. Here I made intimacies that have lasted me\r\nthrough life. I followed the hounds on the Campagna, and was amused at\r\nthe nonchalance of the young Italian swells as they would attempt a high\r\nCampagna fence, tumble off invariably, remount, and go at it again. They\r\nwere a handsome set of men, as plucky as they were handsome. I myself\r\nfound “discretion the better part of valor,” and would quietly take to\r\nthe road when I met a formidable jump, but I lived on horseback and\r\nenjoyed every hour. Though carrying letters to our American Minister,\r\nthen resident at Rome, I gave his legation a wide berth, as I had heard\r\nthat our distinguished Representative was in the habit of inviting\r\nItalians to meet Italians and Americans to meet only Americans at his\r\nhouse; when asked his reason for this, he replied: “I have the greatest\r\nadmiration for my countrymen: they are enterprising, money getting, in\r\nfact, a wonderful nation, but there is not a gentleman among them.”\r\nHearing this, I resolved he should get no chance to meet me and pass on\r\nmy merits.\r\n\r\nSeveral of our handsomest New York women were then having their busts\r\nsculptured in marble; as you saw them first in the clay you found them\r\nmore attractive. Gibson for the first time colored his Venus; it added\r\nwarmth to it, and I thought improved it.\r\n\r\nThe blessing of the multitude by the Pope from the balcony of St.\r\nPeter’s, under a canopy, with the emblematic peacock feathers held on\r\neither side of him, the illumination of St. Peter’s, and the fireworks\r\nat Easter were most impressive. But I shall attempt no description of\r\nRome. Nowhere in the world can you see such a display.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMANY AND THE ALPS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n     _Summer in Baden-Baden--The Late Emperor William no Judge of\r\n     Wine--My Irish Doctor--His Horror of Water--How an American Girl\r\n     Tried to Captivate Him--The Louisiana Judge--I Win the Toss and Get\r\n     the Mule--The Judge “fixes” his Pony--The “Pike Ballet.”_\r\n\r\n\r\nWe passed our summer at Baden-Baden and literally lived there in the\r\nopen air. Opposite to my apartment, Prince Furstenburg of Vienna had his\r\nhotel: from him and his suite I learned how to spend the summer months.\r\nAt early dawn they were out in the saddle for a canter; at ten they went\r\nfor a drive down the Allée Lichtenthal and through shady woods, nowhere\r\nseen as at Baden-Baden. They would stop and breakfast in the open air at\r\ntwelve noon, again drive in the afternoon, and dine at the Kursaal at\r\nsix. They kept at least twenty-five horses. We dined daily within a\r\ntable or two of the then Prince of Prussia, afterwards the Emperor\r\nWilliam, whom I soon discovered was no judge of wine, as I drank the\r\nbest and he was evidently indifferent to it. When you see a man sip his\r\nwine and linger over it, that evidences his appreciation of it; but when\r\nyou see him gulp it down, as the Prince did his, you see that he is no\r\nconnoisseur. But I must say here, I had an intense admiration for him.\r\nHis habit of walking two hours under the trees of the Allée Lichtenthal\r\nwas also mine, and it was with pleasure I bowed most respectfully to him\r\nday by day.\r\n\r\nBeing anxious to cross every Alpine pass, I found a distinguished\r\nphysician who lived at Pau, France, on account of his health, and had\r\nthere the practice of the place during the winter months, and who was,\r\nnecessarily, idle in summer, as Pau was then deserted. Still believing\r\nin doctors, I engaged him to travel with me for two months as my\r\nphysician. I agreed to give him a bottle of 1848 Latour for his dinner\r\ndaily, pay his expenses, and to give him a medical fee such as I saw fit\r\nat the end of our trip. He was indeed a man among men. All I can say is\r\nthat when we parted and I handed him his fee, the tears came into his\r\neyes; he grasped my hands, swearing eternal friendship. This doctor made\r\na new man of me. “Throw physic to the dogs,” was his motto; “you will\r\nnever die: you will in the end have to be shot to get you out of the\r\nworld; air and exercise is all you want: eat slowly and do not deluge\r\nyourself with water at dinner.” Of water he had a holy horror. “Drink\r\nwhat good wine you wish and let water alone.” As I had the luxury of a\r\nprivate physician, a friend from Louisiana suggested joining my party\r\nwith his two young daughters. My Irish doctor was the most sensitive of\r\nmen. One day I found he could eat no breakfast. I sympathized with him\r\nand asked him the cause. He replied, “My dear boy, the habits of your\r\nAmerican women. I came down to the breakfast room this morning and\r\nthere I found the oldest of the Judge’s daughters with her back hair\r\ndown and the younger one combing it. This settled me.” I assured him\r\nthis was not the national custom with American women. The young woman\r\nwas simply trying to captivate him by her lovely, long, flowing tresses.\r\nThe doctor was a character. On another occasion a Frenchman lighted a\r\ncigar in our railway compartment. The Doctor detested cigar smoke, and\r\nas there was a large sign in the car, in French, forbidding smoking, he\r\ntouched the Frenchman and pointed to the sign. The Frenchman simply\r\nsmiled blandly. The train stopping, the conductor opened our door, when\r\nthe Frenchman quietly slipped two francs into his hands, saying in\r\nFrench, “Of course I can smoke here, that sign is obsolete, is it not?”\r\nThe conductor replied, “Oh, yes,” and on we went. My Irishman got up and\r\ncommenced taking his coat off. “What are you going to do?” exclaimed the\r\nFrenchman. “Why, throw you out of that window if you do not at once\r\nthrow that cigar away.” There was no mistaking the Doctor’s meaning, so\r\nthe cigar went out and the Frenchman staid in.\r\n\r\nMy traveling Louisiana friend had a charming way of suggesting each\r\nmorning, as we paid our hotel bills, that we should toss up a five-franc\r\npiece and decide, by heads and tails, who was to pay the bill. I did\r\nthis once or twice, when I found, as he always won and I lost, it was a\r\nlosing business for me; but on another occasion was forced into the\r\nplan. To ascend the mountain at Lugano, three wretched beasts were\r\nbrought us by the Italian boys to mount for the ascent. The Judge\r\ninsisted on tossing up a five-franc piece for choice of animals. I was\r\ncompelled to give in and accede to his suggestion, and by great good\r\nluck won first choice. My friend, the Judge, forbade the Doctor advising\r\nme as to the animal I should take, as he knew him to be a good judge of\r\nhorses. There was a feeble, worthless horse that literally could carry\r\nno one; his back all raw; a vicious mule who bit and kicked, and a stone\r\nblind pony that would not go. With my experience of mules in the South,\r\nknowing what sure-footed creatures they were, I chose the mule, had him\r\nblindfolded, mounted him, and off I went. After waiting an hour on the\r\nsummit, the Judge appeared, coat and hat gone, and swearing terribly\r\nthat he would prosecute the canton for his treatment, and horsewhip the\r\nItalian boys. He had let the horse go, and footed it. I soon slipped\r\naway on my mule, letting the irate Louisianian and the Irishman settle\r\nit, on top of the mountain, how they were to have satisfaction out of\r\nthe government for permitting such beasts to be imposed upon travelers.\r\nI was two-thirds down the mountain when I looked behind me and heard the\r\nmost terrible shouts, and saw the Irishman clinging to the pony, over\r\nwhom he had lost all control, and the Judge hanging on by the pony’s\r\ntail, all coming down at a terrific pace. The pony was at first gentle,\r\nbut it appears would not go beyond a walk. The Judge hung on to his tail\r\nto guide himself down the mountain, and finding he would not go fast\r\nenough to suit them, he assured the Irishman he would fix him, and\r\nimmediately stuck his penknife into the beast’s tail. “Fix him,” he did,\r\nfor the creature was so terrified he dashed off at a break-neck pace,\r\nand the Judge, not wishing to be left alone on the mountain, had to hang\r\non by the tail and be dragged along at lightning speed. These beasts\r\nalone knew the way down; once parted from them, they were lost, for the\r\nItalian boys who had furnished them had long since fled from the Judge’s\r\nwrath. The Judge and the Doctor forbade my paying the hotel bill, and I\r\nhad to do it surreptitiously.\r\n\r\nMy doctor (who was a victim to rheumatism) called my attention to the\r\nfact that on the summit of every Alpine pass we crossed, after all other\r\nvegetation ceased, the aconite plant grew, showing nature had provided\r\nthere a remedy for the disease which the severity of the climate\r\ndeveloped in man. My Irish friend, living far from the sea, had a\r\npassion for all fish but pike, which he detested, and which was daily\r\nserved to us wherever we went; finally, reaching Berlin, he insisted on\r\nhaving sea fish. It was promised us, but, lo and behold! when dinner was\r\nserved, in came the pike, with the apology that no other fish could then\r\nbe had in the city. After dinner we went to the opera, and there, in the\r\nballet (superbly done as it was), were at least one hundred pike dancing\r\non the stage, which so upset my friend that he seized his hat in a rage\r\nand left the house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWINTER IN PAU.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n     _Winter in Pau--I Hire a Perfect Villa for $800 a year--Luxury at\r\n     Small Cost--I Learn How to Give Dinners--Fraternizing with the\r\n     Bordeaux Wine Merchants--The Judge’s Wild Scheme--I Get Him up a\r\n     Dinner--General Bosquet--The Pau Hunt--The Frenchmen Wear Beautiful\r\n     Pink Coats but their Horses Wont Jump--Only the General Took the\r\n     Ditch._\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter you have been a little while in Europe you are seized with a\r\ndesire to have a house of your own, to enjoy home comforts. Your loss of\r\nindividuality comes over you. In Paris you feel particularly lost, and\r\nas this feeling increased on me I resolved to go to Pau, take a house,\r\nand winter there. The Duchess of Hamilton had abandoned the idea of\r\npassing the winter in Pau, so that many lovely residences were seeking\r\ntenants. For eight hundred dollars a year I hired a beautiful villa,\r\nlooking on the Pyrénées, directly opposite the _Pic du Midi d’Ossau_,\r\nwith lovely grounds filled with camelia bushes, and I then felt that I\r\nhad all a man could desire,--a perfect home made to one’s hand, a\r\nclimate where the wind never blows hard enough, even in winter, to stir\r\na leaf on the trees, the best cooks in the world, and where people\r\nappeared to live but to eat well and sleep. A country of beautiful\r\nwomen; the peasantry a mixture of Spanish and French blood; the climate\r\nso soft and genial as to take away all harshness or roughness from their\r\nfaces--rich Titian-like women, with fine coloring and superb\r\nfigures--what more could man desire? I was, I may say, a pioneer\r\nAmerican there.\r\n\r\nA member of a distinguished New York family, who had been our Secretary\r\nof Legation at Madrid, had preceded me; he had a lovely English wife,\r\nwas the master of the hounds, and gave me a cordial reception. I lived\r\nthere two winters, with a luxury I have never since enjoyed, and\r\nliterally for nothing, comparing one’s expenses there to living in New\r\nYork. The desire to entertain took possession of me and I gratified it;\r\nsuch dinners and such wines! I ran down to Bordeaux, made friends with\r\nall the wine fraternity there, tasted and criticised, and wormed myself\r\ninto the good graces of the owners of those enormous Bordeaux _caves_,\r\nlearned there for the first time what claret was, and how impossible it\r\nwas to drink out of Bordeaux, what a Bordeaux connoisseur would call a\r\nperfect wine. There I learned how to give dinners; to esteem and value\r\nthe _Coq de Bruyère_ of the Pyrénées and the _Pie de Mars_ (squab\r\nMagpie).\r\n\r\nPau was filled with sick English people. I was one of the few sound men\r\nphysically in the place. I dashed into society with a vim. My Louisiana\r\nfriend, the Judge, followed me there, and I had my hands full in\r\nestablishing him socially. Shrewd, and immensely clever, he came to me\r\none day and said, “My friend, I am going to make a name for myself in\r\nthis place; wait and you will see.” Some little distance from Pau,\r\nthere was a large tract of worthless land, utterly valueless, called\r\n_Les Landes_. Shepherds on stilts tended a few sheep on it. The judge at\r\nonce had an interview with the Prêfet of the Basses Pyrénées (an officer\r\nsimilar to the governor of one of our States), and assured him of the\r\nfeasibility of reclaiming all this land and making fine cotton fields of\r\nit. This scheme, wonderful to relate, was seized upon with avidity by\r\nthe Prêfet, and my friend, the Judge, was asked to submit his views.\r\nThis was all he wanted. Of course he never perfected his plans for such\r\nwork. The Prêfet, however, was at once his friend and admirer, and he\r\nwas made the distinguished and sought-after stranger of that winter. He\r\nthen came to me to get up a dinner for him, to be given to his newly\r\nacquired friend, which he charged me to make the most brilliant and\r\nsuperb dinner ever given in that place. I well remember his order to the\r\nflorist; “Furnish me for my table such a display of flowers as you would\r\nprovide for your Emperor; spare no expense.” I telegraphed to Paris and\r\nexhausted all my resources to give him what he wished. When his guests\r\nwere all assembled in his _salon_, my friend could not remember who was\r\nto take in who to dinner; so with great coolness he walked over to me,\r\nand to distract the attention of his assembled guests, said, in a loud\r\nvoice, “Your horses, I am told, have run away, upset your carriage, and\r\nkilled the coachman.” Instantly the French people sprang up, exclaiming,\r\n“What! what is it! is it possible!” while the Judge, in a low voice,\r\nwhispered, “Tell me quick who is to take in Madame J., and who goes in\r\nwith Count B.?” I told him, when he quietly said, “All made up, my boy,\r\nlet them believe it.” The dinner was a success, such a success that I\r\nresolved to give a ball myself on the arrival from Paris of one of our\r\nNew York merchant princes, to whom I was much indebted.\r\n\r\nThe French papers gave a glowing account of this ball, and I was fairly\r\nlaunched into the French society of the Basses Pyrénées. It is hard to\r\nconvince an old business man, who has had large experience and amassed a\r\nfortune, that any one can do anything in his line better than himself.\r\nTherefore, when I gave my merchant prince exquisite Bordeaux wines that\r\nI knew were incomparable, and extolled them, he quietly replied:\r\n\r\n“Why, my young friend, these wines are all from the house of Barton &\r\nGuestier. Now, you must know, that the house of Johnson can alone\r\nfurnish what I class as the best clarets. I have for forty years been in\r\ncorrespondence with that house, and will guarantee to produce here in\r\nPau, from them, clarets and sauternes better than any your house of\r\nBarton & Guestier can send you.” I took him up at once, and the wager\r\nwas a fine dinner of twenty covers. All I had to do was to write the\r\nabove statement to Mr. Guestier, who at once sent me his own butler to\r\nserve the wines, and sent with him a “Haut Brion” and a Chateau Latour\r\nof 1848. As he termed it, _mise en bouteille tout à fait speciale hors\r\nde ligne_, whose smoothness, bouquet, and flavor surpassed anything I\r\nhad ever dreamt of tasting. My merchant prince with his Johnson wines\r\nwas beaten out of sight, and so mortified was he that the day after the\r\ndinner he sent me as a present all the wines Johnson had sent him.\r\n\r\nThe hunt was then really the feature of Pau life, for those who could\r\nnot follow in the saddle would, after attending the meet, take to the\r\nroads and see the best of the run. General Bosquet, returning then to\r\nPau, his native city, was fêted by both French and English. He had so\r\ndistinguished himself in the Crimean War that all regarded him as a\r\ngreat hero. The English particularly wanted to express their admiration\r\nof him, so they asked him to appear with his friends at the next Meet,\r\nand follow in the hunt, promising him rare sport and a good run after a\r\nbagged fox. To do him honor, the French, to a man, ordered new hunting\r\nsuits, all of them turned out in “pink,” and being in force made indeed\r\na great show.\r\n\r\nMy Irish doctor was by my side, in great good humor, and a wicked\r\ntwinkle in his eye. Turning to me he said:\r\n\r\n“You will soon see some fun; not one of these Frenchmen can take that\r\njump; it is a _rasper_. Not a man of them will clear that bank and\r\nditch.”\r\n\r\nI smiled at this, and felt that to the end of time it would always be\r\nEnglish against French. It was cruel; but men should not pretend to ride\r\nafter hounds when they cannot take the jumps.\r\n\r\n“Look at those chaps,” he said, “in spotless pink; not a man among them\r\nwho can jump a horse to any purpose.”\r\n\r\nThey were the nobility of the Basses Pyrénées, a splendid, gallant set\r\nof fellows; all prepared “to do or die.” The master of the hounds raised\r\nhis hat, the fox was turned out of the bag; he was given ten minutes’\r\nlaw; then the huntsman with his pack dashed away, clearing both bank and\r\nditch. It was the severest jump they could find in any part of that\r\ncountry, purposely chosen for that reason. My doctor’s little Irish boy,\r\na lad of sixteen years, went at it, and cleared it at a bound. I saw the\r\nmaster of the hunt (an American, a splendid looking fellow, superbly\r\nmounted, and a beautiful rider), with General Bosquet at his side, turn\r\nto the General (who was riding one of his horses), and shout:\r\n\r\n“General, dash the spurs into her; lift her head a bit, and follow me.”\r\n\r\nThe General did not hesitate; he plunged the spurs into the beast,\r\ndashed ahead, and cleared bank and ditch. All his friends followed him.\r\nForward they went, but only for a few rods, when every horse, as if\r\nshot, came to a full stop, planted his forefeet in front of him, and\r\nneither whip nor spur could budge him. None would take the jump; every\r\nFrenchman’s face became ashey pale, and I really felt sorry for them.\r\nNot a Frenchman, with the exception of the General, took that jump.\r\nAfter this, the mere mention of fox hunting would set the Frenchmen\r\nwild. It was cruel, but it was sport.\r\n\r\n_Moral_: Men should not attempt to do what is not in them.\r\n\r\nPassing two winters at Pau and the summers at Baden-Baden, keeping four\r\nhorses at the former place, following the hounds at least once a week,\r\ngiving all through the winter from one to two dinners a week, with an\r\nEnglish housekeeper, and living as well as I could possibly live, with\r\nthe cost of my ball included, I did not spend half the amount in living\r\nthat I am compelled to in New York. The ball cost me but eight hundred\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOME AGAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n     _My Return to New York--Dinner to a Well-known Millionaire--Visit\r\n     of Lord Frederick Cavendish, Hon. E. Ashley, and G. W. des Voeux to\r\n     the United States--I Entertain Them at My Southern Home--My\r\n     Father’s Old Friends Resent my Manner of Entertaining--Her\r\n     Majesty’s Consul disgruntled--Cedar Wash-tubs and Hot Sheets for my\r\n     English Guests--Shooting Snipe over the Rice Lands--Scouring the\r\n     Country for Pretty Girls._\r\n\r\n\r\nCalled home by the stupidity of an agent, who was unable to treat with\r\nmy old friend, Commodore Vanderbilt, for an extension of his lease of\r\nour dock property, most unwillingly we left our dear old Pau, with all\r\nits charming associations, and returned to New York.\r\n\r\nI have always had a great fondness for men older than myself. Always\r\npreferring to associate with my superiors than my inferiors in\r\nintellect, and hence when brought in contact with one of America’s\r\nnoblest and most cultivated men (withal, the then richest man in the\r\nUnited States, if not in the world), by his son-in-law, with whom I had\r\nformed a close intimacy abroad, I sought his society, and he, in turn,\r\nappeared at least to enjoy mine. Dining with him constantly, I suggested\r\nthat he should dine with me; to which he readily assented. So I went to\r\nCranston, my landlord of the New York Hotel, and put him to his trumps\r\nto give me a suitable dinner. His hotel was then crowded, and I had\r\nactually to take down a bedstead and improvise a dining-room. Cranston\r\nwas one of those hotel-keepers who worked as much for glory as for\r\nmoney. He gave us simply a perfect dinner, and my dear old friend and\r\nhis wife enjoyed it. I remember his saying to me, “My young friend, if\r\nyou go on giving such dinners as these you need have no fear of planting\r\nyourself in this city.” I here give the menu of this dinner:\r\n\r\n_CARTE DU DINER._\r\n\r\nLes Huitres, salées.\r\n\r\nLe Potage de Consommé de Volaille, à la Royale.\r\n\r\nLe Basse rayée, grillée, Sauce Remoulade.\r\n\r\nLes Pommes de Terre, à la Lyonnaise.\r\n\r\nLa Mayonnaise de Homard, decorée à la gélée.\r\n\r\nLe Filet de Bœuf, piqué, rôti, aux champignons.\r\n\r\nLes Cailles, truffées, à la Financière.\r\nLes Côtelettes d’Agneau, à la Soubise.\r\nLes Tomates, à l’Americaine.\r\nLes Petits Pois, à la Française.\r\n\r\nCanvas-back Ducks, roasted.\r\nLe Celeri, au jus.\r\n\r\nLes Huitres, grillées, à la Ste. Augustine.\r\n\r\nLe Pouding de Cabinet.\r\nLa Gélée, au rhum.\r\nLes Méringues, à la Chantilly.\r\n\r\nLes Glaces de Crême, à la Portugaise.\r\nLes Quatre Mendiants.\r\nLes Fruits.\r\nLe Café, etc.\r\n\r\n_L’Hôtel New York_,\r\n_Mercredi, le 5 Janvier, 1859_.\r\n\r\nJust at this time three charming men visited New York and were fêted by\r\nmy little circle of friends. They were Lord Frederick Cavendish, Hon.\r\nEvelyn Ashley, and G. W. des Voeux, now Governor of Hong Kong; three of\r\nthe brightest spirits I had ever met, and without the slightest\r\npretension; in fact, just what the real English gentleman always\r\nis,--the first gentleman in the world. Fearing a cold winter, and a\r\nfriend who was going off on a foreign mission offering me his furnished\r\nhouse in Savannah, with all his servants, etc., I took it on a lease and\r\nproposed leaving for my native city in January. Finding my English\r\nfriends also going South, I invited them to pass a month with me in my\r\nSouthern home. All my European purchases, my china, glass, and\r\nbric-à-brac, I did not even unbale in New York, but shipped them\r\ndirectly to Savannah. Before leaving I took the precaution to order my\r\nmarketing from old Waite of Amity Street (the then famous butcher), to\r\nbe sent to me weekly, and started my new Southern household.\r\n\r\nI naturally prided myself, on appearing in my native city, in putting my\r\nbest foot foremost, and entertaining as well as I knew how, or, rather,\r\nin giving to my Southern friends, the benefit of my European education\r\nin the way of dinner giving. I found this, at first, instead of\r\ngratifying my father’s friends rather piqued them; they said--“Heydey!\r\nhere is a young fellow coming out here to show us how to live. Why, his\r\nfather did not pretend to do this. Let us let him severely alone,” which\r\nfor a time they did. I took up the young fry, who let their elders very\r\nsoon know that I had certainly learned something and that Mc’s dinners\r\nwere bound to be a feature in Savannah. Then the old patriarch of the\r\nplace relented and asked me to a grand dinner.\r\n\r\nThe papers had announced the intended visit to Savannah of the son of\r\nthe Duke of Devonshire, and the son of the Earl of Shaftesbury.\r\nSouthern people then worshipped the English nobility. They prided\r\nthemselves on retaining all the old English habits and customs, and of\r\nbeing descendants of the greatest nation of the world,--excepting their\r\nown. The host at the dinner announced the coming of these distinguished\r\nmen, and wondered who in Savannah would have the honor of entertaining\r\nthem. The British Consul then spoke up, he was a great character there,\r\ngiving the finest dinners, and being an authority on wine, i.e. Madeira,\r\n“Her Majesty’s Consul will have the honor.” I secretly smiled, as I knew\r\nthey were coming to me, and I expected them the next day. This same good\r\nold Consul had ignored me, hearing I had had the audacity to give at my\r\ntable _filet de bœuf aux truffes et champignons_. I returned home\r\nfeeling sure that these young noblemen would be but a few hours under my\r\nroof before Her Majesty’s Consul would give me the honor of a visit. In\r\nfact, my guests had not been with me an hour when my old friend, the\r\nConsul, rushed up my front steps. Meeting me at the door he threw his\r\narms around my neck, exclaiming, “My dear boy, I was in love with your\r\nmother thirty years ago; you are her image; carry me to your noble\r\nguests.” Ever after I had the respect and esteem of this dear old man,\r\nwho, for Savannah, was rich as Crœsus, and before all things esteemed\r\nand valued a good dinner and a fine glass of Madeira. My _filets de\r\nbœuf_, and the scions of noble English houses placed me in the front\r\nsocial rank in that little, aristocratic town, and brought forth from\r\none of its oldest inhabitants the exclamation, “My dear boy, your aunts,\r\nthe Telfairs, could give breakfasts, but you, you can give dinners.”\r\n\r\nKnowing the Englishmen’s habits, I gave to each one of them, on their\r\narrival, enormous cedar wash-tubs and hot sheets for their morning\r\nablutions; then a good breakfast, after which we drove to the river and\r\nhad my brother-in-law’s ten-oared boat, called “The Rice Bird,” all the\r\noarsmen in yachting rig, myself at the tiller, and the darkeys, knowing\r\nthey would all have tobacco, or money, pulled for dear life from the\r\nstart to the finish, giving us their plantation songs. The leader\r\nimprovised his song, the others only singing in chorus. On these\r\noccasions, the colored people would give you in song all the annoyances\r\nthey were subjected to, and the current events of plantation life,\r\nbringing in much of and about their “Massa” and his family, as follows:\r\n“Massa Ward marry our little Miss Sara, bring big buckra to Savannah,\r\ngwine to be good times, my boys, pull boys, pull, over Jordan!” Reaching\r\nthe plantations, of which there were three, Fairlawn, Argyle, and\r\nShaftesbury, well equipped with admirable dogs (for my brother-in-law\r\nwas a great sportsman), we would shoot snipe over the rice lands until 2\r\nP.M., then lunch elaborately in his plantation house, and row back in\r\nthe cool of the afternoon, dining at 8 o’clock, and having as my guests\r\nevery pretty girl within a hundred miles and more of the city. The\r\nflowers, particularly the rose called the Cloth of Gold, and the black\r\nrose, I was most prodigal with. I had given a fee to the clerk of the\r\nmarket to scour the country for game and delicacies, so our dinners were\r\nexcellent, and the old Southern habit of sitting over Madeira until the\r\nsmall hours was adopted, and was, with the bright minds I had brought\r\ntogether, most enjoyable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMERRYMAKING IN THE SOUTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n     _A Southern Deer Park--A Don Quixote Steed--We Hunt for Deer and\r\n     Bag a Turkey--Getting a Dinner by Force--The French Chef and the\r\n     Colored Cook Contrasted--One is Inspired, the Other Follows\r\n     Tradition--Making a Sauce of Herbs and Cream--Shooting Ducks Across\r\n     the Moon--A Dawfuskie Pic-nic._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a small place, life is monotonous if you do not in some way break up\r\nthis monotony. I bethought me of a friend who lived some distance from\r\nSavannah, who had a deer park, was a sportsman, and was also the soul of\r\nhospitality. His pride lay in his family and his surroundings; so I\r\nwrote to him as follows: “My dear friend, I have no baronial mansion; I\r\nam a wanderer on the face of the earth, while you possess what I most\r\ncovet, an ancestral home and a great domain. Will you then invite my\r\nguests and me to pay you a visit and give us a chance at your deer?”\r\nBack came the invitation: “Come to me at once with your noble friends.\r\nI and my whole county will receive them and do them honor.” The next\r\nmorning, by ten, we were at the railway station. Before leaving the\r\ncarriage I saw a distinguished General, a sort of Dalgetty of a man, who\r\npreferred to fight than eat, pacing up and down the railway platform. A\r\nruffled shirt, not spotless, a fierce air, an enormous false diamond\r\npin, as big as a crown piece, in the center of his ruffled shirt bosom,\r\nwith a thin gold chain attached to it and to his waistcoat, to prevent\r\nits loss. He at once approached me and exclaimed, “By Jove! by Jove! Mc,\r\nintroduce me to your noble friends.” The introduction made, he\r\naccompanied us to the train, and in turn presented us to a large crowd\r\nassembled to see what Southern people were so proud of, “thoroughbreds,”\r\nas he called them. I repeatedly heard him exclaim, “No jackass stock\r\nhere, sir; all thoroughbreds! I could tell ’em in the dark.” On rolled\r\nthe train, and we soon reached our destination, and were no sooner out\r\nof the cars than we were enveloped by a myriad of sand flies. You could\r\ncut them with a knife, as it were. My friend, a six-footer, stepped up\r\nto my guests and was presented. He then addressed them as follows: “Will\r\nyour lordships ride or drive?”\r\n\r\nIn the mean while, his coachman, a seedy old darkey, in a white hat at\r\nleast ten years old, fly specked to such an extent that its original\r\ncolor was lost, in shabby, old, well-worn clothes, seized me by the coat\r\ntail, exclaiming, “Massa Ward, show me the ‘big buckras.’” After\r\npointing them out, we all pressed through the crowd to the wagon and\r\nhorses, two marsh tackeys, with their manes and tails so full of burrs,\r\nand so netted together, as to form a solid mass; stirrup leathers pieced\r\nwith clothes lines, and no evidence of either of the animals having ever\r\nseen or been touched by a curry-comb. “Don Quixote, by Jove!” exclaimed\r\nthe heir of the Shaftesburys, and vaulted into the saddle, while the\r\nrepresentative of the house of Devonshire and myself took our seats in\r\nthe open wagon. At this point, our hospitable host called the attention\r\nof his lordship to his horses and gave him their pedigree. One was\r\nsixteen hands high, had a bob tail, and high action; the other was a\r\nlittle pony of fourteen hands, with an ambling gait. Not giving any sign\r\nof moving, our host held forth as follows: “Your lordship, so well bred\r\nare these horses that if they are not properly caparisoned, nothing\r\nhuman could stir them; they will plant their feet in the soil and\r\nneither whip nor spur would budge them. You see how well my boy keeps\r\ntheir harnesses.” By this time I was convulsed. Cavendish, I saw, was\r\nlaughing inwardly, but suppressed it. The straw in one collar was\r\nbulging out, one turret was gone, and a piece of rope lengthened one of\r\nthe traces. Truly, it had seen better days. If he calls that a fitting\r\nharness for his horses, what am I to expect in the way of a house and\r\ndeer park? However, my fears were allayed. The house was a charming old\r\nSouthern plantation house, and the owner of it, the embodiment of\r\nhospitality. When the cloth was removed at dinner, I trembled. For my\r\ndear old father had always told me that on his circuit (annually made by\r\nthe Savannah lawyers) he always avoided this house, for in it one could\r\nnever find so much as a glass of whiskey. What then was my surprise, to\r\nhave placed before us a superb bottle of sherry, since world-renowned,\r\ni.e. in this country; and a matchless Madeira, which he claimed he had\r\ninherited from his father, to be opened at the marriage of his sister.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, at the very break of day fixed for our deer hunt, the\r\nnegro boys commenced tooting horns. As soon as I could see, I looked out\r\nof my windows and there saw four old lean, lank dogs, lifeless looking\r\ncreatures, and four marsh tackeys, decorated, front and rear, with an\r\nabundance of burrs. Off we went, as sorry a looking company as one’s eye\r\nhad ever seen, with a crowd of half-naked children following the\r\nprocession. We were out eight hours, went through swamp after swamp, our\r\ntackeys up to their fetlocks in mud, and sorry a deer did we see. One\r\nwild turkey flew over us, which my host’s colored huntsman killed, the\r\nonly man in the party who could shoot at all.\r\n\r\nReturning to Savannah, we went after quail. One morning, being some\r\nfourteen miles from the city, we felt famished, having provided no lunch\r\nbasket. I asked a friend, who was shooting with us and acting as our\r\nguide, if there was a white man’s house within a mile or two where we\r\ncould get a biscuit. He replied, “No, not one.”\r\n\r\nI pressed the matter, saying, “We must have a bite of something,” and\r\nurged him to think again. He reflected, and then said, as if to himself,\r\n“Oh, no use to go there, we will get nothing.” I took him up at once.\r\n\r\n“What do you refer to,” I said. “Oh,” he replied, “there is a white man\r\nwho lives within a mile of us, but he is the meanest creature that\r\nlives and will have nothing to give us.”\r\n\r\n“Who is he?” I exclaimed. He gave me his name. “What,” said I, “Mr.\r\nJones, who goes to Newport every summer?” “The same,” said he; “do you\r\nknow him?”\r\n\r\n“Know him?” I answered, “why, man, I know no one else. He has for years\r\nasked me to visit his plantation. He lives like a prince. I saw him at a\r\ngreat fête at Ochre Point, Newport, several years ago. He turned up his\r\nnose at everything there, saying to me, ‘Why, my dear fellow, these\r\npeople don’t know how to live. This fête is nothing to what I can do, at\r\nmy place. Why, sir, I have so much silver I dare not keep it in my\r\nhouse. The vaults of the State Bank of Georgia are filled with my\r\nsilver. This fête may be well enough here, but come to me at the South,\r\ncome to my plantation, and I will show you what a fête is. I will show\r\nyou how to live.’” My friend listened to all this with astonishment.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said he, “I have nothing to say. That is ‘big’ talk. Go on to\r\nyour friend’s place and see what you will find.” On we moved, four as\r\nhungry men as you could well see. We reached the plantation, on which we\r\nfound a one-story log cabin, with a front piazza, one large center room,\r\nand two shed rooms. There was a small yard, inclosed with pine palings\r\nto keep out the pigs, who were ranging about and ineffectually trying to\r\ngain an entrance. We entered the house, and, seeing an old colored man,\r\nmy Southern friend opened on the old darkey with: “Where is your\r\nmaster?”\r\n\r\n“In Savannah, sir.”\r\n\r\n“When does he dine?”\r\n\r\n“At six o’clock, sir.”\r\n\r\n“What have you got for his dinner, old man?”\r\n\r\n“Pea pie.”\r\n\r\n“Is that all that he has for his dinner?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“What is pea pie?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Cow peas and bacon,” was the answer.\r\n\r\nWith this, my Southern friend stepped to the back door of the house,\r\nasked the old man to point him out a fat turkey. The old darkey did\r\nthis, saying,\r\n\r\n“There’s one, sir, but, Lord help me, Massa, don’t kill him.”\r\n\r\nThe protest came too late. Up to the shoulder went the gun, and down\r\nfell the turkey. Now, turning to the old darkey, he said:\r\n\r\n“Old man, pick that turkey and roast him, and tell your Massa four big\r\nbuckra men are coming to dine with him to-day, at six o’clock.” We got\r\nsome corn-bread from the kitchen and went off shooting. A few minutes\r\nbefore six, we returned, and heard indeed a racket in that old cabin.\r\nThe “Massa” was there, as we saw by the buggy, standing in the front\r\nyard; the horse browsing a few feet off, the harness in the buggy, and\r\nthe master shouting out, “You tell me white men came here, kill my\r\nturkey, tell you to cook him, and you don’t know them? Who in the devil\r\ncan they be?” No sooner had he got this out, when I appeared on the\r\nscene. Up went his arms in astonishment.\r\n\r\n“Why, Mc., is this you? Glad to see you and your friends.”\r\n\r\nDown we sat at his table, and had a dinner of small rice, pea pie, and\r\nroast turkey, washed down by a bottle of fine old Madeira, which he\r\ncalled “the blood of his ancestors.” I looked in vain for a side-board\r\nto put silver on, or any evidence of any past fête having been given on\r\nthe premises. Our host was a thoroughly local man; one of those men who,\r\nwhen in Paris, would say, “I’m going to town,” when he proposed\r\nreturning to Savannah, which, at that time, was to him the metropolis of\r\nAmerica. This gentleman then, like others in the South, cultivated the\r\nbelief that they alone lived well, and that there was no such thing as\r\ngood society in New York or other Northern cities; that New Yorkers and\r\nNorthern people were simply a lot of tradespeople, having no\r\nantecedents, springing up like the mushroom, who did not know how to\r\nlive, and who, when they gave dinners to their friends, ordered them\r\nfrom a neighboring restaurant.\r\n\r\nAt a large dinner in Savannah, given to an ex-Mayor of New York, one of\r\nthe best dinner-givers in that city made the foregoing statement, and\r\nthe ex-Mayor actually called upon me to substantiate it, declaring it\r\nhad always been his practice thus to supply his table, when he invited a\r\ndozen or more people to dinner. So far from this being the case, I then\r\nand there assured my Southern friends that no people in the world lived\r\nbetter than New Yorkers, so far as creature comforts were concerned. I\r\nhave tested the capacity of the Southern cook alongside of the French\r\n_chef_; I had them together, cooking what we call a “Saratoga Lake\r\nDinner” at Newport, a dinner for sixty people; serving alone Spanish\r\nmackerel, Saratoga potatoes, soft shell crabs, woodcock, chicken\r\npartridges, and lettuce salad. Both were great artists in their way, but\r\nthe _chef_ came off very much the victor. I doubted then, and I doubt\r\nnow, if the dinners in London are better than our New York dinners,\r\ngiven by one of the innumerable good dinner-givers. Our material is\r\nbetter in New York, and our cooks are equally as good as those in\r\nEngland. The sauces of the French cuisine are its feature, while there\r\nis not a single sauce in African or Southern cooking. The French get the\r\nessence and flavor out of fowl, and discard the huge joints. Take for\r\ninstance, soup; give a colored cook a shin of beef and a bunch of\r\ncarrots and turnips, and of this he makes a soup. A Frenchman, to give\r\nyou a _consommé royale_, requires a knuckle of veal, a shin of beef, two\r\nfat fowls, and every vegetable known to man. The materials are more than\r\ndouble the expense, but then you have a delicacy of flavor, and a\r\nsifting out of everything that is coarse and gross. The _chef_ is an\r\neducated, cultivated artist. The colored cook, such as nature made him,\r\npossessing withal a wonderful natural taste, and the art of making\r\nthings savory, i.e. taste good. His cookery book is tradition. French\r\n_chefs_ have their inspirations, are in every way almost as much\r\ninspired as writers. To illustrate this: when Henry IV. was fighting in\r\nthe Pyrénées, he told his French cook to give him a new sauce. The reply\r\nwas, “Where are the materials for it, your Majesty? I have nothing here\r\nbut herbs and cream.” “Then make a sauce from them,” was the King’s\r\nanswer. The _chef_ did this, and produced one of the best sauces in the\r\nFrench cuisine, known as _sauce Bearnaise_.\r\n\r\nHaving exhausted quail and snipe shooting and made a failure at deer\r\nhunting, we went on the banks of the rice plantations at night, to shoot\r\nwild ducks, as they crossed the moon. Whilst whiling away the time,\r\nwaiting for ducks, we talked over England and America. Lord Frederick\r\nCavendish assured me that if I were then living in England, I could not\r\nthere lead a pleasanter life than I was then leading. He liked\r\neverything at the South, the hospitality of the people, and their simple\r\ncontentment and satisfaction with their surroundings. On these three\r\nplaces there were then six hundred slaves; the net income of these\r\nestates was $40,000 a year. They would have easily brought half a\r\nmillion. When the Civil War terminated, my brother-in-law was offered\r\n$100,000 for them; by the war he had lost all his slaves. To-day the\r\nestates would scarcely bring $30,000, showing the change in values\r\ncaused by the Civil War.\r\n\r\nI was then able to show my guests a Savannah picnic, which is an\r\ninstitution peculiar to the place. Leaving the city in a river steamer\r\nour party consisting of one hundred people, after a little over an\r\nhour’s sail we reached an island in the Atlantic Ocean, known as\r\nDawfuskie, a beautiful spot on which stood a charming residence, with\r\nfive acres of roses surrounding the house. The heads of families\r\ncarried, each of them, huge baskets containing their dinner, and a full\r\ntable service, wine, etc., for say, ten or a dozen people. On our\r\narrival, all formed into groups under the trees, a cloth was laid on the\r\nground, dishes, plates and glasses arranged on it, and the champagne at\r\nonce _frapped_ in small hand pails. There was then a dance in the open\r\nair, on a platform, and in the afternoon, with cushions as seats for the\r\nladies, these improvised dinner-tables were filled. Each had its\r\nseparate hostess; all was harmony and pleasure. As night approached, the\r\npeople re-embarked on the steamer and returned home by moonlight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE AT NEWPORT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n     _I Leave the South--A Typical British Naval Officer--An Officer of\r\n     the Household Troops--Early Newport Life--A Country Dinner--The Way\r\n     I got up Picnics--Farmers Throw their Houses Open to Us--A Bride\r\n     Receives us in her Bridal Array--My Newport Farm--My Southdowns and\r\n     my Turkeys--What an English Lady said of our Little Island--Newport\r\n     a place to Take Social Root in._\r\n\r\n\r\nMy English friends bidding me farewell, soon after, I gave up my\r\nSavannah house and made Newport my permanent home, for I spent nine\r\nmonths of the year there, with a winter trip to the West Indies. I must\r\nnot omit to mention here that while passing the winter at Nassau, N. P.,\r\nI made the acquaintance of a most polished, elegant, and courtly man, a\r\ncaptain in the British Navy, who entertained me as one can only be\r\nentertained on a British man-of-war, giving me Devonshire cream and\r\nevery luxury, and all as well served as though it had been ashore.\r\nMeeting him repeatedly at dinner at the house of the Governor of the\r\nBahamas, he suggested that as it was a most difficult thing to board the\r\nsteamship that was to take us to New York, she never crossing the bar,\r\nhe would himself, in his own gig, take us out to that vessel when we\r\nleft the island.\r\n\r\nI had forgotten this kind promise, but on the day fixed for our\r\ndeparture (it then blowing a gale, one of those terrible “northers” of\r\nthe West Indies), I received a note from this gallant captain, telling\r\nme that his boat’s crew had already crossed the bar, boarded our\r\nsteamer, and learnt the precise spot where she would lie in the\r\nafternoon when she would take on her passengers. In vain did I protest\r\nagainst his undertaking this dangerous piece of work. Do it he would;\r\nand taking the tiller himself, we were safely rowed in his gig, twelve\r\nmiles, and boarded the vessel.\r\n\r\nI afterwards learned that while he was going from his vessel in full\r\nevening dress, with his white gloves carefully buttoned (for he was\r\ncalled the dandy of the English Navy), he sprang overboard and saved one\r\nof his men from drowning.\r\n\r\nOn our reaching the deck of the steamer, I was struck with the\r\nobsequiousness of the steamer’s captain to the naval officer, (she was,\r\nby the way, a Cunarder). My friend, the captain, then introduced me to\r\none of his countrymen, saying to me, simply, “You will find him a nice\r\nfellow.” He turned out to be one of the most distinguished young men in\r\nEngland, an officer of the Household Troops, a most fascinating man, who\r\nhad been to Jamaica to look after his father’s estates there. I\r\nintroduced him to my friends in New York, and in return for the\r\nhospitality extended to him then, heard later that he, on receiving\r\nletters of introduction from me, had paid marked attention to the\r\nbearers of the letters. I relate this as an evidence that Englishmen do\r\nreciprocate attentions received in this country.\r\n\r\nNewport was now at its best. The most charming people of the country had\r\nformed a select little community there; the society was small, and all\r\nwere included in the gaieties and festivities. Those were the days that\r\nmade Newport what it was then and is now, the most enjoyable and\r\nluxurious little island in America. The farmers of the island even\r\nseemed to catch the infection, and they were as much interested in the\r\nsuccess of our picnics and country dinners, as we were ourselves. They\r\nthrew open their houses to us, and never heeded the invasion, on a\r\nbright sunshiny day, of a party of fifty people, who took possession of\r\ntheir dining-room, in fact of their whole house, and frolicked in it to\r\ntheir heart’s content. To be sure, I had often to pacify a farmer when a\r\nliveried groom robbed his hen roost, but as he knew that this\r\nfashionable horde paid their way, he was easily soothed. I always then\r\nremarked that in Newport, at that time, you could have driven a\r\nfour-in-hand of camels or giraffes, and the residents of the island\r\nwould have smiled and found it quite the thing. The charm of the place\r\nthen was the simple way of entertaining; there were no large balls; all\r\nthe dancing and dining was done by daylight, and in the country. I did\r\nnot hesitate to ask the very _crême de la crême_ of New York society to\r\nlunch and dine at my farm, or to a fishing party on the rocks. My little\r\nfarm dinners gained such a reputation that my friends would say to me:\r\n“Now, remember, leave me out of your ceremonious dinners as you choose,\r\nbut always include me in those given at your farm, or I’ll never forgive\r\nyou.” But to convey any idea of our country parties, one must in detail\r\ngive the method of getting them up: Riding on the Avenue on a lovely\r\nsummer’s day, I would be stopped by a beautiful woman, in gorgeous\r\narray, looking so fascinating that if she were to ask you to attempt the\r\nimpossible, you would at least make the effort. She would open on me as\r\nfollows: “My dear friend, we are all dying for a picnic. Can’t you get\r\none up for us?”\r\n\r\n“Why, my dear lady,” I would answer, “you have dinners every day, and\r\ncharming dinners too; what more do you want?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, they’re not picnics. Any one can give dinners,” she would reply;\r\n“what we want is one of your picnics. Now, my dear friend, do get one\r\nup.”\r\n\r\nThis was enough to fire me, and set me going. So I reply:\r\n\r\n“I will do your bidding. Fix on the day at once, and tell me what is the\r\nbest dish your cook makes.”\r\n\r\nOut comes my memorandum book, and I write: “Monday, 1 P.M., meet at\r\nNarragansett Avenue, bring _filet de bœuf piqué_,” and with a bow am\r\noff in my little wagon, and dash on, to waylay the next cottager, stop\r\nevery carriage known to contain friends, and ask them, one and all, to\r\njoin our country party, and assign to each of them the providing of a\r\ncertain dish and a bottle of champagne. Meeting young men, I charge them\r\nto take a bottle of champagne, and a pound of grapes, or order from the\r\nconfectioner’s a quart of ice cream to be sent to me. My pony is put on\r\nits mettle; I keep going the entire day getting recruits; I engage my\r\nmusic and servants, and a carpenter to put down a dancing platform, and\r\nthe florist to adorn it, and that evening I go over in detail the whole\r\naffair, map it out as a general would a battle, omitting nothing, not\r\neven a salt spoon; see to it that I have men on the road to direct my\r\nparty to the farm, and bid the farmer put himself and family, and the\r\nwhole farm, in holiday attire.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, as my farmer had just taken unto himself a bride, a\r\nyoung and pretty woman, I found that at mid-day, to receive my guests,\r\nshe had dressed herself in bridal array; she was _décolleté_, and seemed\r\nquite prepared to sing the old ballad of “Coming thro’ the rye”; but as\r\nher husband was a stalwart young fellow, and extremely jealous, I\r\nadvised the young men in the party to confine their attentions to their\r\nown little circle and let Priscilla, the Puritan, alone.\r\n\r\nWhen I first began giving picnics at my farm, I literally had no stock\r\nof my own. I felt that it would never do to have a gathering of the\r\nbrightest and cleverest people in the country at my place with the\r\npastures empty, neither a cow nor a sheep; so my Yankee wit came to my\r\nassistance. I at once hired an entire flock of Southdown sheep, and two\r\nyoke of cattle, and several cows from the neighboring farm, for half a\r\nday, to be turned into my pasture lots, to give the place an animated\r\nlook. I well remember some of my knowing guests, being amateur farmers,\r\nexclaiming:\r\n\r\n“Well, it is astonishing! Mc has but fifty acres, and here he is,\r\nkeeping a splendid flock of Southdowns, two yoke of cattle, to say\r\nnothing of his cows!”\r\n\r\nI would smile and say:\r\n\r\n“My friend I am not a fancy farmer, like yourself; I farm for profit.”\r\n\r\nAt that time, I was out of pocket from three to four thousand dollars a\r\nyear by my farm, but must here add, for my justification, that finding\r\namateur farming an expensive luxury, I looked the matter squarely in the\r\nface, watched carefully the Yankee farmers around me, and satisfied\r\nmyself that they knew more about the business than I did, and at once\r\nfollowed in their footsteps, placed my farm on shares, paying nothing\r\nout for labor, myself paying the running expenses, and dividing the\r\nprofits with my farmer. Instead of losing three or four thousand dollars\r\na year by my farm, it then paid me, and continues to pay me seven to\r\neight hundred dollars a year clear of all expenses. We sell off of fifty\r\nacres of land, having seventeen additional acres of pasturage, over\r\nthree thousand dollars of produce each year. I sell fifty Southdown\r\nlambs during the months of April and May, at the rate of eight to ten\r\ndollars each, to obtain which orders are sent to me in advance, and my\r\nwinter turkeys have become as famous as my Southdown lambs. The farm is\r\nnow a profit instead of a loss. I bought this place in 1853; if I had\r\nbought the same amount of land south of Newport, instead of north of the\r\ntown, it would have been worth a fortune to-day.\r\n\r\nTo return to our picnic. The anxiety as to what the weather would be,\r\nwas always my first annoyance, for of course these country parties hinge\r\non the weather. After making all your preparations, everything ready for\r\nthe start, then to look out of your window in the morning, as I have\r\noften done, and see the rain coming down in torrents, is far from making\r\nyou feel cheerful. But, as a rule, I have been most fortunate in my\r\nweather. We would meet at Narragansett Avenue at 1 P.M., and all drive\r\nout together. On reaching the picnic grounds, I had an army of\r\nskirmishers, in the way of servants, thrown out, to take from each\r\ncarriage its contribution to the country dinner. The band would strike\r\nup, and off the whole party would fly in the waltz, while I was\r\ndirecting the icing of the champagne, and arranging the tables; all done\r\nwith marvelous celerity. Then came my hour of triumph, when, without\r\ngiving the slightest signal (fearing some one might forestall me, and\r\ntake off the prize), I would dash in among the dancers, secure our\r\nsociety queen, and lead with her the way to the banquet. Now began the\r\nfun in good earnest. The clever men of the party would assert their\r\nclaims to the best dishes, proud of the efforts of their cook, loud in\r\ntheir praise of their own game pie, which most probably was brought out\r\nby some third party, too modest to assert and push his claim. Beauty was\r\nthere to look upon, and wit to enliven the feast. The wittiest of men\r\nwas then in his element, and I only wish I dared quote here his\r\nbrilliant sallies. The beauty of the land was also there, and all\r\nfeeling that they were on a frolic, they threw hauteur, ceremonial, and\r\ngrand company manners aside, and, in place, assumed a spirit of simple\r\nenjoyment. Toasts were given and drunk, then a stroll in pairs, for a\r\nlittle interchange of sentiment, and then the whole party made for the\r\ndancing platform, and a cotillon of one hour and a half was danced, till\r\nsunset. As at a “Meet,” the arrivals and departures were a feature of\r\nthe day. Four-in-hands, tandems, and the swellest of Newport turn-outs\r\nrolled by you. At these entertainments you formed lifetime intimacies\r\nwith the most cultivated and charming men and women of this country.\r\n\r\nThese little parties were then, and are now, the stepping-stones to our\r\nbest New York society. People who have been for years in mourning and\r\nthus lost sight of, or who having passed their lives abroad and were\r\nforgotten, were again seen, admired, and liked, and at once brought into\r\nsociety’s fold. Now, do not for a moment imagine that all were\r\nindiscriminately asked to these little fêtes. On the contrary, if you\r\nwere not of the inner circle, and were a new-comer, it took the combined\r\nefforts of all your friends’ backing and pushing to procure an\r\ninvitation for you. For years, whole families sat on the stool of\r\nprobation, awaiting trial and acceptance, and many were then rejected,\r\nbut once received, you were put on an intimate footing with all. To\r\nacquire such intimacy in a great city like New York would have taken you\r\na lifetime. A fashionable woman of title from England remarked to me\r\nthat we were one hundred years behind London, for our best society was\r\nso small, every one in it had an individuality. This, to her, was\r\ncharming, “for,” said she, “one could have no such individuality in\r\nLondon.” It was accorded only to the highest titled people in all\r\nEngland, while here any one in society would have every movement\r\nchronicled. Your “_personnel_,” she added, “is daily discussed, your\r\nequipage is the subject of talk, as well as your house and household.”\r\nAnother Londoner said to me, “This Newport is no place for a man without\r\nfortune.” There is no spot in the world where people are more _en\r\nevidence_. It is worth while to do a thing well there, for you have\r\npeople who appreciate your work, and it tells and pays. It is the place\r\nof all others to take social root in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOCIETY’S LEADERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n     _Society’s Leaders--A Lady whose Dinners were Exquisite and whose\r\n     Wines were Perfect--Her “Blue Room Parties”--Two Colonial\r\n     Beauties--The Introduction of the Chef--The Prince of Wales in New\r\n     York--The Ball in his Honor at the Academy of Music--The Fall of\r\n     the Dancing Platform--Grotesque Figures cut by the Dancers--The\r\n     Prince Dances Well--Admirable Supper Arrangements--A Light Tea and\r\n     a Big Appetite--The Prince at West Point--I get a Snub from General\r\n     Scott._\r\n\r\n\r\nSociety must have its leader or leaders. It has always had them, and\r\nwill continue to have them. Their sway is more or less absolute. When I\r\ncame to New York as a boy, forty years ago, there were two ladies who\r\nwere skillful leaders and whose ability and social power the fashionable\r\nworld acknowledged. They gave the handsomest balls and dinners given in\r\nthis city, and had at them all the brilliant people of that period.\r\nTheir suppers, given by old Peter Van Dyke, were famous. Living in two\r\nadjoining houses which communicated, they had superb rooms for\r\nentertaining. These were the days when Isaac Brown, sexton of Grace\r\nChurch, was, in his line, a great character. His memory was something\r\nremarkable. He knew all and everything about everybody, knew always\r\nevery one’s residence, was good-nature itself, and cracked his jokes and\r\nhad a word for every one who passed into the ball-room. You would hear\r\nhim _sotto voce_ remarking upon men as they passed: “Old family, good\r\nold stock,” or “He’s a new man; he had better mind his p’s and q’s, or I\r\nwill trip him up. Ah, here’s a fellow who intends to dance his way into\r\nsociety. Here comes a handsome boy, the women are crazy about him,” etc.\r\n\r\nA year or two later, during my absence in Europe and at the South, a\r\nlady living in Washington Place found herself filling a very conspicuous\r\nplace in the matter of social entertainment by the departure of her\r\nhusband’s relatives, who had been society’s leaders, for a prolonged\r\nstay in Europe. A woman of charming manners, possessing eminently the\r\ntalent of social leadership, she took up and easily carried on society\r\nas represented by the “smart” set. For from six to seven years she gave\r\nbrilliant entertainments; her dinners were exquisite; her wines perfect;\r\nher husband’s Madeiras are still famous. At that time, her small dances\r\nwere most carefully chosen; they were the acme of exclusiveness. On this\r\nshe prided herself. She also arranged and controlled for two years (the\r\nwinters of 1870 and 1871) small subscription balls at Delmonico’s,\r\nFourteenth Street, in his “blue rooms.” They were confined to the young\r\nmen and maidens, with the exception, perhaps, of a dozen of the young\r\nmarried couples; a few elderly married ladies were invited as matrons.\r\nThese dances were known and became famous as the “Blue Room parties.”\r\nThere were three hundred subscribers to them. Having a large fortune,\r\nshe was able to gratify her taste in entertaining. Her manners were\r\ncharming, and she was a most pleasing conversationalist. Her\r\nbrother-in-law was one of the founders of the Patriarchs, and at a later\r\nperiod her two sons-in-law also joined them, though the younger of the\r\ntwo, the husband of her accomplished and beautiful daughter, has lived\r\nabroad for many years, but is still numbered among the brilliant members\r\nof our society. It was during the winter of 1871 that a ball was given\r\nin these same rooms to Prince Arthur, when on his visit here. On this\r\noccasion, the Prince danced with the daughter of my old friend, the\r\nMajor, who, in air and distinction, was unrivaled in this country.\r\n\r\nAbout this time two beautiful, brilliant women came to the front. They\r\nwere both descended from old Colonial families. They had beauty and\r\nwealth, and were eminently fitted to lead society. A new era then came\r\nin; old fashions passed away, new ones replaced them. The French _chef_\r\nthen literally, for the first time, made his appearance, and artistic\r\ndinners replaced the old-fashioned, solid repasts of the earlier period.\r\nWe imported European habits and customs rapidly. Women were not\r\nsatisfied with their old _modistes_, but must needs send to Paris for\r\neverything. The husband of one of these ladies had a great taste for\r\nsociety, and also a great knowledge of all relating to it. His delight\r\nwas to see his beautiful young wife worshipped by everybody, which she\r\nwas, and she soon became, in every sense, the prominent leader. All\r\nadmired her, and we, the young men of that period, loved her as much as\r\nwe dared. All did homage to her, and certainly she was deserving of it,\r\nfor she had every charm, and never seemed to over-appreciate herself, or\r\nrecognize that as Nature had lavished so much on her, and man had laid\r\nwealth at her feet, she was, in every sense, society’s queen. She was a\r\nwoman _sans aucune prétention_. When you entered her house, her\r\nreassuring smile, her exquisitely gracious and unpretending manner of\r\nreceiving, placed you at your ease and made you feel welcome. She had\r\nthe power that all women should strive to obtain, the power of attaching\r\nmen to her, and keeping them attached; calling forth a loyalty of\r\ndevotion such as one imagines one yields to a sovereign, whose subjects\r\nare only too happy to be subjects. In the way of entertaining, the\r\nhusband stood alone. He had a handsome house and a beautiful picture\r\ngallery (which served as his ball-room), the best _chef_ in the city,\r\nand entertained royally.\r\n\r\nI well remember being asked by a member of my family, “Why are you so\r\neager to go to this leader’s house?” My reply always was, “Because I\r\nenjoy such refined and cultivated entertainments. It improves and\r\nelevates one.” From him, I literally took my first lesson in the art of\r\ngiving good dinners. I heard his criticisms, and well remember asking\r\nold Monnot, the keeper of the New York Hotel:\r\n\r\n“Who do you think has the best cook in this city?”\r\n\r\n“Why, of course, the husband of your leader of fashion, for the simple\r\nreason that he makes his cook give him a good dinner every day.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJust at this time all New York aroused, and put on their holiday attire\r\nat the coming of the Prince of Wales. A grand ball at the Academy of\r\nMusic was given him. Our best people, the smart set, the slow set, all\r\nsets, took a hand in it, and the endeavor was to make it so brilliant\r\nand beautiful that it would always be remembered by those present as one\r\nof the events of their lives.\r\n\r\nMy invitation to the ball read as follows:\r\n\r\n     _THE GENERAL COMMITTEE OF ARRANGEMENTS_\r\n\r\n     _Invite Mr. Ward McAllister to a Ball to be given by the Citizens\r\n     of New York to the_\r\n\r\n     PRINCE OF WALES,\r\n\r\n     _At the Academy of Music, on Friday Evening, the twelfth of\r\n     October, 1860, at nine o’clock_.\r\n\r\nPETER COOPER,\r\n_Chairman_.\r\n\r\n_M. B. Field_,\r\n_Secretary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ball was to be opened by a _Quadrille d’Honneur_. Governor and Mrs.\r\nMorgan, Mr. Bancroft the historian, and Mrs. Bancroft, Colonel and Mrs.\r\nAbraham Van Buren, with others, were to dance in it. Mrs. Morgan had\r\nforgotten all she had learned of dancing in early childhood, so she at\r\nonce took dancing lessons. Fernando Wood was then Mayor of New York. The\r\ngreat event of the evening was to be the opening quadrille, and the rush\r\nto be near it was so great that the floor gave way and in tumbled the\r\nwhole centre of the stage. I stood up in the first tier, getting a good\r\nview of the catastrophe. The Duke of Newcastle, with the Prince, who, as\r\nit happened, was advancing to the centre of the stage, followed by all\r\nwho were to dance in the quadrille, at once retired with the Prince to\r\nthe reception room, while Mr. Renwick, the architect, and a gang of\r\ncarpenters got to work to floor over the chasm. I well remember the\r\nenormous form of old Isaac Brown, sexton of Grace Church, rushing\r\naround and encouraging the workmen. A report had been spread that the\r\nDuke would not allow the Prince to again appear on the stage.\r\n\r\nIn the mean while, the whole royal party were conversing in groups in\r\nthe reception room. The Prince had been led into a corner of the room by\r\nthe Mayor’s daughter, when the Duke, feeling the young lady had had\r\nfully her share of his Royal Highness, was about to interrupt them, when\r\nour distinguished magistrate implored him not to do so. “Oh, Duke,” he\r\nexclaimed, “let the young people alone, they are enjoying themselves.”\r\nThe stage made safe, the quadrille was danced, to the amusement of the\r\nassembled people. The old-fashioned curtseys, the pigeon-wings, and\r\ngenuflexions only known to our ancestors were gone through with dignity\r\nand repose. Mrs. Van Buren, who had presided over the White House during\r\nMartin Van Buren’s presidency, has repeatedly since discussed this\r\nquadrille with me, declaring she was again and again on the point of\r\nlaughing at the grotesque figures cut by the dancers.\r\n\r\n“But, my dear sir,” she said, “I did not permit my dignity and repose to\r\nbe at all ruffled; I think I went through the trying ordeal well; but\r\nwhy, why will not our people learn to dance!” A waltz immediately\r\nfollowed the quadrille; the Prince, a remarkably handsome young man,\r\nwith blue eyes and light hair, a most agreeable countenance, and a\r\ngracious manner, danced with Miss Fish, Miss Mason, Miss Fannie Butler,\r\nand others, and danced well. I followed him with a fair partner, doing\r\nall I could to enlarge the dancing circle. He danced incessantly until\r\nsupper, the arrangements for which were admirable.\r\n\r\nOne entered the supper room by one stage door and left it by another; a\r\nhorseshoe table ran around the entire room,--behind it stood an army of\r\nservants, elbow to elbow, all in livery. At one end of the room was a\r\nraised dais, where the royal party supped. At each stage door a\r\nprominent citizen stood guard; the moment the supper room was full, no\r\none else was admitted. As fifty would go out, fifty would come in. I\r\nremember on my attempting to get in through one of these doors,\r\nstealthily, the vigilant eye of John Jacob Astor met mine. He bid me\r\nwait my turn. Nothing could have been more successful, or better done.\r\nThe house was packed to repletion. Now, all was the Prince. The city\r\nrang with his name; all desired to catch a glimpse of him. His own\r\npeople could not have offered him greater homage.\r\n\r\nA friend of mine at Barrytown telegraphed me to come to him and pass\r\nSunday, and on Monday go with him to West Point to a breakfast to be\r\ngiven by Colonel Delafield, the Commandant of the Point, to the Prince\r\nof Wales. It was in the fall of the year, when the Hudson was at its\r\nbest, clothed in its autumnal tints. I was enraptured on looking out of\r\nmy window on Sunday morning at the scene that lay before me, with the\r\nriver, like a tiny thread away below, gracefully flowing through a\r\nwilderness of foliage, the flock of Southdown sheep on my friend’s lawn,\r\nthe picturesque little stone chapel adjoining his place, all in full\r\nview, and the great masses of autumn leaves raked in huge piles. Going\r\nto church in the morning, I proposed to myself a ten-mile walk in the\r\nafternoon to get an appetite for what I felt sure would be my friend’s\r\nbest effort in the way of a dinner, as he well knew I loved the “flesh\r\npots of Egypt.” Fully equipped for my walk, the butler entered my room\r\nand announced luncheon. I declined the meal. Again he appeared, stating\r\nthat the family insisted on my lunching with them, as on Sunday it was\r\nalways a most substantial repast.\r\n\r\nMy host now appeared to enforce the request. I protested. “My dear\r\nfellow, I can dine but once in twenty-four hours; dinner to me is an\r\nevent; luncheon is fatal to dinner--takes off the edge of your\r\nappetite, and then you are unfit to do it justice.”\r\n\r\n“Have it as you will,” he replied, and off I went. Returning, I donned\r\nmy dress suit, and feeling as hungry as a hound, went to the\r\ndrawing-room to await dinner. Seven came, half after seven, and still no\r\nannouncement of that meal. I felt an inward sinking. At eight the butler\r\nannounced “Tea is served.”\r\n\r\n“Good heavens!” I muttered to myself; “I have lost dinner,” and woefully\r\nwent in to tea. I can drink tea at my breakfast, but that suffices; I\r\ncan never touch it a second time in twenty-four hours. I think my host\r\ntook in the situation, and to intensify my suffering, walked over to me,\r\ntapping me on the back, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n“My dear boy, in this house we never dine on Sunday.”\r\n\r\n“Why in the plague, then,” I thought, “did you ask me up here on a fast\r\nday? However,” I said to myself, “I will make it up on bread and\r\nbutter.” In we went to tea, and a tea indeed it was; what the French\r\nwould call a “_Souper dinatoire_,” the English, a “high tea,” a\r\ncombination of a heavy lunch, a breakfast, and tea. No hot dishes; but\r\nevery cold delicacy you could dream of; a sort of “whipping the devil\r\naround the stump.” No dinner, a gorgeous feast at tea.\r\n\r\nDown the river the next morning we went to West Point, every moment\r\nenjoyable, and reached the Commandant’s house. As General Scott was\r\npresenting Colonel Delafield’s guests to the Prince I approached the\r\nGeneral, asking him to present me to his Royal Highness. A giant as he\r\nwas in height, he bent down his head to me, and asked sharply, “What\r\nname, sir?” I gave him my name, but at the sound of “Mc,” not thinking\r\nit distinguished enough, he quietly said, “Pass on, sir,” and I\r\nsubsequently was presented by the Duke of Newcastle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDELIGHTS OF COUNTRY LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n     _A Handsome, Courtly Man--A Turkey Chase--A Visit to Livingston\r\n     Manor--An Ideal Life--On Horseback from Staatsburg to New\r\n     York--Village Inn Dinners--I Entertain a Fashionable Party at the\r\n     Gibbons Mansion--An Old House Rejuvenated--The Success of the\r\n     Party--Country Life may be Enjoyed Here as well as in England if\r\n     one has the Money and the Inclination for it--It means Hard Work\r\n     for the Host, though._\r\n\r\n\r\nAll my life I had been taught to have a sort of reverence for the name\r\nof Livingston, and to feel that Livingston Manor was a species of\r\npalatial residence, that one must see certainly once in one’s lifetime.\r\nThe opportunity offered itself, and I seized upon it. The owner of the\r\nupper Manor jokingly suggested our forming a party to go there, and take\r\npossession of his house in October, and see the lovely autumn foliage.\r\nBy acclamation, it was resolved that the project be carried out, and I\r\nwent to work, spurring up my old friend, the owner of the Manor, to\r\nprepare for us. As an important feature and member of this party, I must\r\nhere give a slight sketch of one of the handsomest, most fascinating,\r\nmost polished and courteous gentlemen of that or any other period. We\r\nwill here call him the Major; amiability itself, a man both sexes could\r\nfall in love with. I loved him dearly, and when I lost him I felt much\r\nof the charm of life had departed with him. At all these country\r\nparties, he was always first and foremost. My rapidity of thought and\r\naction always annoyed him. “My dear fellow,” he would say, “for heaven’s\r\nsake, go slow; you tear through the streets as if at some one’s bidding.\r\nA gentleman should stroll leisurely, casting his eyes in the shop\r\nwindows, as if in search of amusement, while you go at a killing pace,\r\nas if on business bent. The man of fashion should have no business.”\r\nAgain, he had a holy horror of familiar garments. “My dear boy,” he\r\nwould smile and say, “when will you discard that old coat? I am so\r\nfamiliar with it, I am fatigued at the sight of it.”\r\n\r\nOn one subject we were always in accord--our admiration for women. My\r\neye was quicker than his, and I often took advantage of it. I would say,\r\n“Major, did you see that beauty? By Jove, a most delicious creature!”\r\n\r\n“Who? Where?” he would exclaim.\r\n\r\n“Why, man,” I replied, “she has passed you; you have lost her.”\r\n\r\n“Lost her! How could you let that happen? Why, why did you not sooner\r\ncall my attention to her?”\r\n\r\nApropos of the Major, I must tell a good story at his expense:\r\n\r\nAs my farm parties were always gotten up at a day’s notice, I was often\r\nin straits to provide the dishes, for all that was wanting to complete\r\nthe feast I furnished myself. A boned turkey, on one occasion, was\r\nabsolutely necessary. The day was a holiday. I must at once place it in\r\nthe cook’s hands. The shops were all shut, so I suggested to the Major\r\nthat he drive out with me to my farm and procure one. When we reached\r\nthe place, farmer and family, we found, had gone off visiting; there was\r\nno one there. I took in the situation at a glance.\r\n\r\n“Major,” I said, “there, in that field, is a gobbler; that turkey you\r\nand I have got to catch, if it takes us all night to get him. Positively\r\nI shall not leave the place without him.” He looked aghast. There he\r\nwas, in Poole’s clothes, the best dressed man in America! This he always\r\nwas. On this point, a friend once got this off on him. As he was\r\nentering his club, with another well-dressed man of leisure, this\r\ngentleman exclaimed, “Behold them! like the lilies of the field, they\r\ntoil not, neither do they spin, yet Solomon in all his glory was not\r\narrayed like one of these.” Clothes, or no clothes, in pursuit of the\r\nturkey we went. Over fences, under fences, in barnyards and through\r\nfields, at a full run, the perspiration pouring down the cheeks of the\r\ndear old Major, and I screaming encouragement to him. “Try it again,\r\nMajor! head him off! now you have him!”\r\n\r\nFinally, after an hour’s chase, we got the bird, when, throwing off his\r\ncoat, straightening himself up and throwing his arms akimbo, he\r\nexclaimed, “Well, Mc, the profession of a gentleman has fallen very low\r\nwhen it takes him to chasing turkeys.”\r\n\r\n“My dear fellow,” I replied, “the great Chancellor Livingston once said,\r\n‘a gentleman can do anything; he can clean his own boots, but he should\r\ndo it well.’”\r\n\r\nTo return to our excursion.\r\n\r\nThe party to go up the North River to the Manor Livingston, and ride\r\nback to New York, was at once formed. My first discussion with the Major\r\nwas as to the propriety of taking a valet, he insisting it was\r\nindispensable, that every college boy in England, on three hundred\r\npounds a year, had his valet. I contended that they were nuisances, and\r\nit was not the habit to indulge in them here. Besides this, our host\r\nwould have his hands full in caring for us, and would feel we were\r\nimposing on him if each of us took a man servant. This settled it. The\r\nMajor and I were to travel together and meet the party at Staatsburg.\r\nLet me here say that people of the world put up with the annoyance of\r\ntravel better than any other class of people.\r\n\r\nThe glorious morning that we left the cars at Poughkeepsie, and mounted\r\nour horses, I shall never forget. That lovely ride, from Poughkeepsie to\r\nStaatsburg, under that superb row of old trees, put me in mind of the\r\nLong Walk at Windsor; it is equally as handsome. We speculated on the\r\nway as to what we were to expect. “If he has no _chef_, I leave in\r\ntwenty-four hours,” exclaimed my friend. I assured him we might feel\r\nsecure of finding artistic cooking and of having a very jolly good time.\r\nInstead of a palace, I found a fine, old-fashioned country-house, very\r\ndraughty, but beautifully placed amid magnificent forest trees. My first\r\nexploit was to set fire to the carpet in my room by building a huge\r\nfire in my grate, to try and keep warm. As the Major put it, “My dear\r\nboy, burn yourself up if you will, but kindly remember you endanger all\r\nour lives.”\r\n\r\nAt eleven every morning we were all in the saddle, and went off for a\r\nride of some twenty miles, lunching at some fine house or other. It was\r\nEnglish life to perfection, and most enjoyable. Hyde Park, with two\r\nsuperbly kept places, and its little village church on a Sunday, carried\r\nyou back to England, and it seemed then to me that you there found the\r\nperfection of country life.\r\n\r\nIt was whilst dining in one of these old baronial mansions, that I\r\nconceived the idea of transporting the whole party to my late\r\nfather-in-law’s place at Madison, New Jersey, and giving them myself, in\r\nhis old residence, another country entertainment. After inviting them, I\r\nbegan to realize what I had undertaken. The house itself was all one\r\ncould wish, built of brick, and nearly as large as the White House in\r\nWashington. But it had been shut up and unoccupied for years; however, I\r\nwas in for it and I resolved, in spite of all difficulties, to carry it\r\nthrough successfully. After a week at the Manor, our whole party of some\r\ndozen ladies and gentlemen mounted our horses, and rode down to New\r\nYork, sending the servants ahead by rail, to engage apartments, have our\r\nrooms ready, and dinner prepared for us at the village inns where we\r\nwere to sleep. It was amusing to see the gentlemen in dress coats and\r\nwhite cravats, and the ladies in their handsome toilets, sitting down in\r\na village inn to ham and eggs and boiled chicken and cabbage; but, as we\r\nhad always sent on the wine, and had the best of servants to look after\r\neverything, we enjoyed these inn dinners very much. Not a murmur from\r\nany of the ladies of any discomfort; they found everything charming and\r\namusing. So day by day we rode, chatting away and enjoying each other’s\r\nsociety, and at night, after a cosy little meal, we were all only too\r\nglad to seek the arms of Morpheus.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to my family at Newport and informed them of what I had\r\ndone, that I had invited a dozen of the most _difficile_, fastidious\r\npeople of Newport to pass ten days with us in New Jersey, at my\r\nbrother-in-law’s then unoccupied and shut-up residence, there was but\r\none exclamation, “You are crazy! How could you think of such a thing!\r\nHow are you to care for all these people in that old deserted house?”\r\nAll they said did not discourage me. I determined to show my friends\r\nthat, though the Gibbons mansion was not a Manor house, it was deserving\r\nof the name, and was, at that date, one of the handsomest, largest, most\r\nsubstantial, and well-built residences at the North. When the Civil War\r\nbroke out, my brother-in-law requested me to make it my home.\r\n\r\nI give in detail all I did to successfully entertain my friends for ten\r\ndays in this old family house, as it may instruct others how to act in\r\na similar case. In London, during the season, one hires a house for a\r\nfew days to give a ball in, and there are many very superb large houses\r\nused there in this way every year. Telegraphing at once to the agent who\r\nhad charge of this house to put an army of scrubbing-women in it, and\r\nhave it cleaned from cellar to garret, I next went into the wholesale\r\nbusiness of kerosene and lamps. In the country particularly there is\r\nnothing like an illumination _à giorno_ at night. I hunted up an\r\nexperienced _chef_, got my servants, and then made _menus_ for ten\r\ndinners, lunches, and breakfasts, as my guests were asked for a certain\r\nlength of time; engaged a country band of music for the evenings,\r\ntelegraphed to Baltimore for my canvasbacks, arranged for my fish,\r\nvegetables, and flowers to be sent up by train daily from New York,\r\npurchased myself every article of food that I would require to make up\r\nthese _menus_, gave orders for my ices, bonbons, and cakes, everything\r\nthat must be fresh to be good, to come to me by express; sent up my\r\nwines, but no Madeira, as I knew there was enough of that wine in the\r\nwine cellars of that old house to float a frigate; looked after my\r\nstabling, and found we could stable twenty horses in a fine brick\r\nstable, and house all the drags and vehicles. The conservatories were\r\nfull of orange and lemon trees. The house itself, architecturally, was a\r\nduplicate of the White House in Washington, and almost as large. It had\r\na superb marble hall, 20 × 45, leading to a dining-room, 36 × 25. The\r\nhouse was built in 1836, of brick, in a forest of trees, with the three\r\nfarms surrounding it really forming part of the grounds, containing a\r\nthousand acres of land. The house and grounds cost in 1836 over\r\n$150,000. All I had to do, then, was to reanimate the interior and take\r\nfrom hidden recesses the fine old family china, and the vast quantity of\r\nsilver accumulated in the family for three generations. My wife’s\r\ngrandfather had been a distinguished lawyer; being wealthy, he had some\r\nof his lawyer’s fees which were paid in Spanish dollars, melted into\r\nplate. I only wish it had been my good fortune to have secured some of\r\nthose old grand silver salvers.\r\n\r\nBefore a guest arrived, everything on and about the place had life and\r\nanimation. To all my guests the house was a surprise, for it had never\r\nbefore been shown to fashionable people. As on the North River, we\r\npassed the days in the saddle, and driving four-in-hands, lunched with\r\nmany distinguished people, at their distant country places, and lived\r\nfor those ten days as thoroughly an English life as one would have lived\r\nat a country house in England. I had invited young men to come down from\r\nNew York every evening to join us at dinner, and even the fastidious and\r\nexacting Major, I think, was satisfied with everything. The success of\r\nthis party evidenced that a country house can be made as perfect and\r\nenjoyable here as in any other country, provided you will take the\r\ntrouble and bear the expense. Now, Newport life is wholly and entirely a\r\ncontrast to all this, for the charm of that place is its society. You do\r\nnot bring it there, but find it there, and it takes care of itself, and\r\ncomes to you when you wish it; thus you are relieved of the care of\r\nproviding daily for a large company, to do which is well enough in\r\nEngland, where you inherit your servants with your fortune, while here,\r\nto have things properly done, be you who you may, you must give them\r\nyour time and attention. This country party I gave in November, 1862.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFASHIONABLE PEOPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n     _John Van Buren’s Dinner--I spend the Entire Day in getting my\r\n     Dress-Coat--Lord Hartington criticises American\r\n     Expressions--Contrast in our Way of Living in 1862 and 1890--In\r\n     Social Union is Social Strength--We band Together for our Common\r\n     Good--The Organisation of the “Cotillion Dinners”--The “Smart” Set,\r\n     and the “Solid” Set--A Defense of Fashion._\r\n\r\n\r\nMeeting John Van Buren as I left the cars in Jersey City to cross the\r\nferry to New York, he insisted on my dining with him that day at the\r\nUnion Club, to meet Lord Hartington, and his brother, Lord Edward\r\nCavendish, to whom he was giving a large dinner. I declined, as I had no\r\ndress-suit in the city, but he would not take no for an answer.\r\n\r\n“My dear man,” he said, “it will be an event in your life to meet these\r\ndistinguished men. Jump in the first train, return to your country home,\r\nand get your dress-coat. By all means you must not miss my dinner.” As\r\nI knew Lord Frederick Cavendish so well, I really wanted to meet his\r\nbrothers, and as no one could send me my spike-tail coat as they call it\r\nat the South, I took a way train and consumed the entire day getting the\r\nnecessary outfit, and returning with it to the city. To compensate me\r\nfor my day’s work, Van Buren put me next to Lord Hartington. Chatting\r\nwith him, I asked him what he had seen in our habits, manners, and\r\nspeech that struck him as odd. At first he avoided making any criticism,\r\nbut finally he laughingly replied, “The way you all have of saying ‘Yes,\r\nsir,’ or ‘No, sir.’ We never do this in England; it is used thus only by\r\nservants.” James Brady, a great chum of our host’s, being at the dinner,\r\nkept up an incessant fire at Van Buren, who retaliated with, “My dear\r\nLord Hartington, pay no attention to what my friend Brady says; all I\r\ncan say of him is that he is a man who passes one half his time in\r\ndefending criminals and the other half in assailing patriots, such as\r\nmyself.” I was well repaid for all the trouble I had taken to attend\r\nthis dinner.\r\n\r\nAt this time there were not more than one or two men in New York who\r\nspent, in living and entertaining, over sixty thousand dollars a year.\r\nThere were not half a dozen _chefs_ in private families in this city.\r\nCompare those days to these, and see how easily one or two men of\r\nfortune could then control, lead, and carry on society, receive or shut\r\nout people at their pleasure. If distinguished strangers failed to bring\r\nletters to them, they were shut out from everything. Again, if, though\r\ncharming people, others were not in accord with those powers, they could\r\nbe passed over and left out of society. All this many of us saw, and saw\r\nhow it worked, and we resolved to band together the respectable element\r\nof the city, and by this union make such strength that no individual\r\ncould withstand us. The motto, we felt, must be _nous nous soutenons_.\r\nThis motto we then assumed, and we hold it to this day, and have found\r\nthat the good and wise men of this community could always control\r\nsociety. This they have done and are still doing. Our first step then in\r\ncarrying out these views was to arrange for a series of “cotillion\r\ndinners.”\r\n\r\nI must here explain, that behind what I call the “smart set” in society,\r\nthere always stood the old, solid, substantial, and respected people.\r\nFamilies who held great social power as far back as the birth of this\r\ncountry, who were looked up to by society, and who always could, when\r\nthey so wished, come forward and exercise their power, when, for one\r\nreason or another, they would take no active part, joining in it\r\nquietly, but not conspicuously. Ordinarily, they preferred, like the\r\ngods, to sit upon Olympus. I remember a lady, the head of one of these\r\nfamilies, stating to me that she had lived longer in New York society\r\nthan any other person. This point, however, was not yielded or allowed\r\nto go undisputed, for the daughter of a rival house contended that\r\n_her_ family had been longer in New York society than any other family,\r\nand though she had heard the assertion, as I gave it, she would not\r\nadmit its correctness. What I intend to convey is that the heads of\r\nthese families, feeling secure in their position, knowing that they had\r\ngreat power when they chose to exercise it, took no leading part in\r\nsociety’s daily routine. They gave handsome dinners, and perhaps, once a\r\nyear, a fine ball. I know of one or two families who have scrupulously\r\nall their lives avoided display, anything that could make fashionable\r\npeople of them, holding their own, esteemed and respected, and when they\r\nthrew open their doors to society, all made a rush to enter. To this\r\nday, if one of these old families, even one of its remotest branches,\r\ngives a day reception, you will find the street in which they live\r\nblockaded with equipages.\r\n\r\nFor years we have literally had but one _salon_ in this city--a\r\ngathering in the evening of all the brilliant and cultivated people,\r\nboth young and old, embracing the distinguished strangers. A most\r\npolished and cultivated Bostonian, a brilliant woman, was the first, in\r\nmy day, to receive in this way weekly. During her life she held this\r\n_salon_, both here, and all through the summer in Newport. “The robe of\r\nElijah fell upon Elisha” in an extremely talented woman of the world,\r\nwho has most successfully held, and now holds, this _salon_, on the\r\nfirst day of every week during the winter, and at Newport in summer.\r\n\r\nThe mistake made by the world at large is that fashionable people are\r\nselfish, frivolous, and indifferent to the welfare of their\r\nfellow-creatures; all of which is a popular error, arising simply from a\r\nwant of knowledge of the true state of things. The elegancies of\r\nfashionable life nourish and benefit art and artists; they cause the\r\nexpenditure of money and its distribution; and they really prevent our\r\npeople and country from settling down into a humdrum rut and becoming\r\nmerely a money-making and money-saving people, with nothing to brighten\r\nup and enliven life; they foster all the fine arts; but for fashion what\r\nwould become of them? They bring to the front merit of every kind; seek\r\nit in the remotest corners, where it modestly shrinks from observation,\r\nand force it into notice; adorn their houses with works of art, and\r\nthemselves with all the taste and novelty they can find in any quarter\r\nof the globe, calling forth talent and ingenuity. Fashionable people\r\ncultivate and refine themselves, for fashion demands this of them.\r\nProgress is fashion’s watchword; it never stands still; it always\r\nadvances, it values and appreciates beauty in woman and talent and\r\ngenius in man. It is certainly always most charitable; it surrounds\r\nitself with the elegancies of life; it soars, it never crawls. I know\r\nthe general belief is that all fashionable people are hollow and\r\nheartless. My experience is quite the contrary. I have found as warm,\r\nsympathetic, loving hearts in the garb of fashion as out of it. A\r\nthorough acquaintance with the world enables them to distinguish the\r\nwheat from the chaff, so that all the good work they do is done with\r\nknowledge and effect. The world could not dispense with it. Fashion\r\nselects its own votaries. You will see certain members of a family born\r\nto it, as it were, others of the same family with none of its\r\nattributes. You can give no explanation of this; “One is taken, the\r\nother left.” Such and such a man or woman are cited as having been\r\nalways fashionable. The talent of and for society develops itself just\r\nas does the talent for art.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOTILLIONS IN DOORS AND OUT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n     _Cost of Cotillion Dinners--My delicate Position--The Début of a\r\n     Beautiful Blonde--Lord Roseberry’s mot--We have better Madeira than\r\n     England--I am dubbed “The Autocrat of Drawing-rooms”--A Grand\r\n     Domino Ball--Cruel Trick of a fair Mask--An English Lady’s Maid\r\n     takes a Bath--The first Cotillion Dinners given at\r\n     Newport--Out-of-Door Feasting--Dancing in the Barn._\r\n\r\n\r\nBut to return to our Cotillion Dinners. A friend thought they were\r\nimpracticable on account of the expense, but I had remembered talking to\r\nthe proprietor of the famous Restaurant Phillipe in Paris, as to the\r\ncost of a dinner, he assuring me that its cost depended entirely on what\r\nhe called _les primeurs_, i.e. things out of season, and said that he\r\ncould give me, for a napoleon a head, an excellent dinner, if I would\r\nleave out _les primeurs_. Including them, the same dinner would cost\r\nthree napoleons. “I can give you, for instance,” he said, “a _filet de\r\nbœuf aux ceps_ at half the cost of a _filet aux truffes_, and so on,\r\nthrough the dinner, can reduce the expense.” Submitting all this to my\r\nfriend Delmonico, I suggested a similar inexpensive dinner, and figured\r\nthe whole expense down until I reduced the cost of a cotillion dinner\r\nfor seventy-five or a hundred people to ten dollars each person, music\r\nand every expense included. Calling on my friends, they seconded me, and\r\nwe then had a winter of successful cotillion dinners. It was no easy\r\ntask, however. How I was beset by the men to give them the women of\r\ntheir choice to take in to dinner! and in turn by the ladies not to\r\ninflict on them an uncongenial partner. The largest of these dinners,\r\nconsisting of over a hundred people, we gave at Delmonico’s, corner of\r\nFifth Avenue and Fourteenth Street, in the large ball-room. The table\r\nwas in the shape of a horseshoe. I stood at the door of the _salon_,\r\nnaming to each man the lady he was to take in to dinner, and well\r\nremember one of them positively refusing to accept and take in a lady\r\nassigned to him; and she, just entering, heard the dispute, and, in\r\nconsequence, would never again attend one of these dinners. Sitting at\r\nthe head of the table, with the two young and beautiful women who were\r\nthen the _grandes dames_ of that time, one on either side of me, we had\r\nopposite to us, on the other side of the narrow, horseshoe table, a\r\nyoung blonde bride, who had just entered society. I well remember the\r\ncriticisms these grand ladies made of and about her. The one, turning to\r\nme, said, “And this is your lovely blonde, the handsomest blonde in\r\nAmerica!” The other, the best judge of her sex that I have ever seen,\r\nthen cast her horoscope, saying, “I consider her as beautiful a blonde\r\nas I have ever seen. That woman, be assured, will have a brilliant\r\ncareer. Such women are rare.” These words were prophetic, for that\r\nbeautiful bride, crossing the ocean in her husband’s yacht, wholly and\r\nsolely by her beauty gained for her husband and herself a brilliant\r\nposition in London society. Turning to me, the lady who had made this\r\nremark asked me how she herself looked. I replied, “Like Venus rising\r\nfrom the sea.” My serenity was here disturbed by finding that one of the\r\nladies, disliking her next neighbor, as soon as she discovered by the\r\ncard who it was, had quietly made an exchange of cards, depriving a\r\nyoung gallant of the seat he most coveted, and for which he had long and\r\nearnestly prayed. Of course, I was called to explain, and quiet the\r\ndisturbed waters. The gentleman was furious, and threatened dire\r\ndestruction to the culprit. I took in the situation, and protected the\r\nfair lady by sacrificing the waiter. After the ladies left the table, at\r\nthese dinners, the gentlemen were given time to smoke a cigar and take\r\ntheir coffee. On this occasion, the Earl of Roseberry was a guest.\r\nWhilst smoking and commenting on the dinner, he said to me, “You\r\nAmericans have made a mistake; your emblematic bird should have been a\r\ncanvasback, not an eagle.”\r\n\r\nIt was either to this distinguished man or the Earl of Cork, at one of\r\nthese after-dinner conversations, that I held forth on the treatment of\r\nvenison, asserting that here, we always serve the _saddle_ of venison,\r\nwhilst in England they give the _haunch_. And when they send it off to a\r\nfriend, they box it up in a long narrow box, much resembling a coffin.\r\nThe reason for this was given me,--that their dinners were larger than\r\nours, and there was not enough on a saddle for an English dinner. Again,\r\nI called attention to the fact that here we eat the tenderloin steak,\r\nthere they eat the rump steak, which we give to our servants. The reason\r\nfor this, I was told, was that they killed their cattle younger than we\r\nkilled ours, and did not work those intended for beef. On Madeira, I\r\nstated, “we had them,” for, I said, “You have none to liken unto ours”;\r\nthough later on, at another dinner, when I made this assertion, the\r\nDuke of Beaufort took me up on this point, and insisted upon it that in\r\nmany of the old country houses in England they had excellent Madeira.\r\n\r\nThe following anonymous lines on this dinner were sent to me the day\r\nafterwards:\r\n\r\n    There ne’er was seen so fair a sight\r\n    As at Delmonico’s last night;\r\n    When feathers, flowers, gems, and lace\r\n    Adorned each lovely form and face;\r\n    A garden of all thorns bereft,\r\n    The outside world behind them left.\r\n    They sat in order, as if “Burke”\r\n    Had sent a message by his clerk.\r\n    And by whose magic wand is this\r\n    All conjured up? the height of bliss.\r\n    ’Tis he who now before you looms,--\r\n    The Autocrat of Drawing Rooms.\r\n\r\nOne of the events of this winter was a grand domino ball, the largest\r\never given here. Our Civil War was then raging; a distinguished nobleman\r\nappeared at that ball with his friend, a member of Parliament. Before he\r\ncould enter the ball-room, a domino stepped up to him and had an\r\nencounter of words with him. “Are you as brave as you look?” she asked;\r\n“will you do a woman’s bidding? I challenge you to grant me my request!”\r\n“What is it?” he asked. “Allow me to pin on this badge?” “Certainly,”\r\nwas the gallant reply. As he passed through the rooms, it was seen that\r\nhe was wearing a Secession badge. It was thought to be an intended\r\naffront to Northern people, and was immediately resented. His friend,\r\nthe member of Parliament, hearing of it, at once went up to him and\r\nremoved the badge. Many felt that this distinguished man was simply the\r\nvictim of a cruel, mischievous, and silly woman.\r\n\r\nThe following summer, as I had been so hospitably entertained in Nassau,\r\nat Government House, I invited my old friend, the Governor of the\r\nBahamas, to pay me a visit at Newport. On a beautiful summer afternoon,\r\nI drove up to the Brevoort House, and there I found him literally\r\nsurrounded by all his worldly goods, his entire household, with all\r\ntheir effects. It took two immense stages and a huge baggage wagon to\r\nconvey them to the Fall River boat. Imagine this party coming from an\r\nisland where it was a daily struggle to procure food, viewing the\r\nsumptuous supper-tables of these magnificent steamers (which certainly\r\nmade a great impression on them, for it caused them to be loud in their\r\nexpressions of astonishment and admiration). Reaching Newport at 2 A.M.,\r\non attempting to go ashore, I found His Excellency had lost all his\r\ntickets. Our sharp Yankee captain took no stock in people who did such\r\nthings; so out came the Englishman’s pocket-book to pay again for the\r\nentire party, the dear old gentleman declaring it was his fault, and he\r\nought to be made to pay for such carelessness. It did not take me long\r\nto convince our captain that we were not sharpers; that we had paid our\r\npassages, and we must needs be allowed to go ashore.\r\n\r\nI was determined to evidence to my guests that they had reached the land\r\nof plenty, and before they had been with me a week, the Governor\r\ndeclared, with a sigh, “That he detested the sight of food.” I put him\r\nthrough a course of vapor baths, and galloped him daily. On one\r\noccasion, we visited the beach together, when the surf was full of\r\npeople. We saw an enormously tall, Rubens-like woman, clad in a clinging\r\ngarment of calico, exhilarated by the bath, jumping up and down, and in\r\nher ecstasy throwing her arms up over her head. “Who is the creature?”\r\nhe exclaimed. “Is this allowed here! Why, man, you should not tolerate\r\nit a moment!” I gave one look at the female, and then, convulsed with\r\nlaughter, seized his arm, exclaiming, “It is your wife’s English maid!”\r\nIf I had given him an electric shock, he could not have sprung out of\r\nthe wagon quicker. Rushing to the water’s edge, he shouted, “Down with\r\nyou! down with you, this instant, you crazy jade! how dare you disgrace\r\nme in this way!” The poor girl, one could see, felt innocent of all\r\nwrong, but quitted the water at lightning speed when she saw the crowd\r\nthe Governor had drawn around him.\r\n\r\nThe first Cotillion Dinner ever given at Newport, I gave at my Bayside\r\nFarm. I chose a night when the moon would be at the full, and invited\r\nguests enough to make up a cotillion. We dined in the open air at 6\r\nP.M., in the garden adjoining the farm-house, having the gable end of\r\nthe house to protect us from the southerly sea breeze. In this way we\r\navoided flies, the pest of Newport. In the house itself we could not\r\nhave kept them from the table, while in the open air even a gentle\r\nbreeze, hardly perceptible, rids you of them entirely. The farm-house\r\nkitchen was then near at hand for use. You sat on closely cut turf, and\r\nwith the little garden filled with beautiful standing plants, the\r\neastern side of the farm-house covered with vines, laden with pumpkins,\r\nmelons, and cucumbers, all giving a mixture of bright color against a\r\ngreen background, with the whole farm lying before you, and beyond it\r\nthe bay and the distant ocean, dotted over with sailing craft, the sun,\r\nsinking behind the Narragansett hills, bathing the Newport shore in\r\ngolden light, giving you, as John Van Buren then said to me, “As much of\r\nthe sea as you ever get from the deck of a yacht.” Add to this, the\r\nexquisite toilets which our women wear on such occasions, a table laden\r\nwith every delicacy, and all in the merriest of moods, and you have a\r\npicture of enjoyment that no shut-in ball-room could present. No\r\n“pent-up Utica” then confined our powers. Men and women enjoyed a\r\nfreedom that their rural surroundings permitted, and, like the lambs\r\ngambolling in the fields next them, they frisked about, and thus did\r\naway with much of the stiff conventionality pertaining to a city\r\nentertainment.\r\n\r\nOn this little farm I had a cellar for claret and a farm-house attic for\r\nMadeira, where the cold Rhode Island winters have done much to preserve\r\nfor me wines of seventy and eighty years of age. On this occasion, I\r\nremember giving them Amory of 1811 (one of the greatest of Boston\r\nMadeiras), and I saw the men hold it up to the light to see its\r\nbeautiful amber color, inhale its bouquet, and quaff it down “with\r\ntender eyes bent on them.”\r\n\r\nA marked feature of all my farm dinners was _Dindonneaux à la Toulouse_,\r\nand _à la Bordelaise_ (chicken turkeys). In past days, turkeys were\r\nthought to be only fine on and after Thanksgiving Day in November, but I\r\nlearnt from the French that the turkey _poult_ with _quenelle de\r\nvolaille_, with either a white or dark sauce, was the way to enjoy the\r\nRhode Island turkey. I think they were first served in this way on my\r\nfarm in Newport. Now they are thus cooked and accepted by all as the\r\nsummer delicacy.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner we strolled off in couples to the shore (a beach\r\nthree-quarters of a mile in length), or sat under the group of trees\r\nlooking on the beautiful bay.\r\n\r\nMy brother, Colonel McAllister, had exercised his engineering skill in\r\nfitting up my barn with every kind and sort of light. He improvised a\r\nchandelier for the center of it, adorned the horse and cattle stalls\r\nwith vines and greens, fitted them up with seats for my guests (all\r\nnicely graveled), and put a band of music in the hay-loft, with the\r\nmiddle part of the barn floored over for dancing. We had a scene that\r\nTeniers has so often painted. We danced away late into the night, then\r\nhad a glorious moonlight to drive home by.\r\n\r\nI must not omit to mention one feature of these parties. It was the\r\n“Yacht Club rum punch,” made from old Plantation rum, placed in huge\r\nbowls, with an immense block of ice in each bowl, the melting ice being\r\nthe only liquid added to the rum, except occasionally when I would pour\r\na bottle of champagne in, which did it no injury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ERA OF GREAT EXTRAVAGANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n     _The first private Balls at Delmonico’s--A Nightingale who drove\r\n     Four-in-hand--Private Theatricals in a Stable--A Yachting Excursion\r\n     without wind and a Clam-bake under difficulties--A Poet describes\r\n     the Fiasco--Plates for foot-stools and parboiled Champagne for the\r\n     thirsty--The Silver, Gold, and Diamond Dinners--Giving presents to\r\n     guests._\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us now return to New York and its gaieties. The Assemblies were\r\nalways given at Delmonico’s in Fourteenth Street, the best people in the\r\ncity chosen as a committee of management, and under the patronage of\r\nladies of established position. They were large balls, and embraced all\r\nwho were in what may be termed General Society. They were very\r\nenjoyable. A distinguished banker, the head of one of our old families,\r\nthen gave the first _private_ ball at Delmonico’s to introduce his\r\ndaughters to society. It was superb. The Delmonico rooms were admirably\r\nadapted for such an entertainment. There were at least eight hundred\r\npeople present, and the host brought from his well-filled cellar his\r\nbest Madeira and Hock. His was the pioneer private ball at this house.\r\nBeing a success, it then became the fashion to give private balls at\r\nDelmonico’s, and certainly one could not have found better rooms for\r\nsuch a purpose. One of the grandest and handsomest fancy balls ever\r\ngiven here was given in these rooms a little later. Absent at the South,\r\nI did not attend it. Then came in an era of great extravagance and\r\nexpenditure.\r\n\r\nA beautiful woman, who was a nightingale in song, gave a fancy ball. It\r\nwas brilliantly successful, and brought its leader to the front, and\r\ngave her a large following. It made her, with the personal attractions\r\nshe possessed, the belle of that winter. Among other accomplishments,\r\nshe drove four horses beautifully. I remember during the summer passing\r\nher on Bellevue Avenue as she sat perched up on the box-seat of a drag,\r\ndriving four fine horses, handling the ribbons with a grace and ease\r\nthat was admirable. All paid court to her. She won the hearts of both\r\nmen and women.\r\n\r\nAt this time a man of great energy and pluck loomed up, and attracted,\r\nin fact absorbed to a great extent, the attention of society. Full of\r\nenergy and enterprise, and supplied with abundant means, he did a great\r\ndeal for New York, much that will live after him. He created Jerome\r\nPark; and not only created it, but got society into it. He made it the\r\nGoodwood of America, and caused society to take an interest in it. He\r\nopened that park most brilliantly, and, by his energy and perseverance,\r\nrendered it for years a most enjoyable place for all New Yorkers.\r\nAdmiring the beautiful cantatrice, he proposed to her to turn his\r\nluxurious stables into a theatre, and ask the fashionable world to come\r\nand see her act “for sweet charity’s sake,”--to raise funds for the sick\r\nand wounded soldiers. In doing this, he assured her that she would\r\nliterally bring the fashionable world to her feet to petition and sue\r\nfor tickets of admission to this theatre. And so it proved. All flocked\r\nto see this accomplished woman act. The work of this energetic man was\r\nadmirably done. He made a gem of his stable. I can but compare it to a\r\nlittle royal theatre. As you entered you were received by liveried\r\nservants, and by them conducted to your seat, where you found yourself\r\nsurrounded by a most brilliant assemblage; and on the stage, as amateur\r\nactresses, supporting the fair singer, the fashionable beauties of that\r\nday. This was not the least of this generous man’s performances. Being\r\nan admirable four-in-hand driver, he at once revived the spirit for\r\ndriving four horses. He turned out daily with his drag or coach loaded\r\nwith beautiful women, and drove to every desirable little country inn in\r\nand about the city, where one could dine at all well, crossing ferries,\r\nand driving up Broadway with the ease and skill of a veteran whip, which\r\nhe was. His projects were, if anything, too grand. He lavished money on\r\nall these things; his conceptions were good, but, like many great minds,\r\nat times he was too unmindful of detail. On one occasion, at Newport, he\r\ncame to me, and told me he had mapped out a country _fête_, asked my\r\nadvice about getting it up, but failed to take it, and then brought\r\nabout his first _fiasco_. He asked the _beau monde_ to embark on the\r\nyachts then lying in the harbor, and go with him to Stone Bridge to a\r\ndance and clambake. All the yachtsmen placed their yachts at his\r\ndisposal. At 12 M., all Newport, i.e. the fashion of the place, was on\r\nthese yachts. At the prow of the boats he had placed his champagne. Down\r\ncame the broiling sun, and a dead calm fell upon the waters. Tugs were\r\ncalled in to tow the yachts. Orders had been given that not a biscuit or\r\nglass of wine was to be served to any of the party on these boats, that\r\nwe might reach the feast at the Bridge with sharp appetites. The sun\r\nwent down, and the night set in before we landed. We were then taken to\r\nan orchard, the high grass a foot deep all wet, and saw before us great\r\nplates of stewed soft clams and corn that had been cooked and ready for\r\nus at 2 P.M. The women put their plates on the grass, and their feet in\r\nthem, so at least to have a dry footing. The champagne was parboiled,\r\nthe company enveloped in darkness, and famished, so that all pronounced\r\nthis kind of clambake picnic a species of _fête_ not to be indulged in\r\nknowingly a second time. The great wit of the day, his boon companion,\r\ncalled it “The Melancholy Fête.” The following anonymous lines on this\r\nclambake were sent me:\r\n\r\nAN ADAPTATION OF A LAMENTATION.\r\n\r\n    Clams, clams, clams,\r\n      Will always be thrown in my teeth.\r\n    Clams, clams, clams!\r\n      I’ll be crowned with a chowder wreath.\r\n\r\n    Bread and pickles and corn,\r\n      Corn and pickles and bread.\r\n    Whenever I sleep huge ghosts appear\r\n      With _clam_orous mouths to be fed.\r\n\r\n    Oh, women, with appetites strong!\r\n      Oh, girls, who I thought lived on air!\r\n    I did not mean to leave you so long\r\n      With nothing to eat, I declare.\r\n\r\n    Clams, clams, clams!\r\n      I have nothing but clams on the brain.\r\n    I’m sure all my life, and after my death\r\n      I’ll be roasted and roasted again.\r\n\r\n    Oh, tugs, why could you not pull?\r\n      Oh, winds, why would you not blow?\r\n    I’m sure I did all that man could do\r\n      That my clambake shouldn’t be slow.\r\n\r\nNot in the least discouraged by this failure, returning to New York, he\r\nplanned three dinners to be given by himself and two of his friends, to\r\nbe the three handsomest dinners ever given in this city. Lorenzo\r\nDelmonico exclaimed, “What are the people coming to! Here, three\r\ngentlemen come to me and order three dinners, and each one charges me to\r\nmake his dinner the best of the three. I am given an unlimited order,\r\n‘Charge what you will, but make my dinner the best.’” Delmonico then\r\nsaid to me, “I told my cook to call them the Silver, Gold, and Diamond\r\ndinners, and have novelties at them all.” I attended these three\r\ndinners. Among other dishes, we had canvasback duck, cut up and made\r\ninto an _aspic de canvasback_, and again, string beans, with truffles,\r\ncold, as a salad, and truffled ice cream; the last dish, strange to say,\r\nvery good. At one dinner, on opening her napkin, each fair lady guest\r\nfound a gold bracelet with the monogram of Jerome Park in chased gold in\r\nthe centre. Now it must be remembered that this habit of giving ladies\r\npresents at dinners did not originate in this city. Before my day, the\r\nwealthy William Gaston, a bachelor, gave superb dinners in Savannah,\r\nGa., and there, always placed at each lady’s plate a beautiful Spanish\r\nfan of such value that they are preserved by the grandchildren of those\r\nladies, and are proudly exhibited to this day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE BOX SEAT AT NEWPORT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n     _The Four-in-Hand Craze--Postilions and Outriders Follow--A\r\n     Trotting-Horse Courtship--Cost of Newport Picnics Then and\r\n     Now--Driving off a Bridge--An Accident that might have been\r\n     Serious--A Dance at a Tea-house--The Coachmen make a Raid on the\r\n     Champagne--They are all Intoxicated and Confusion Reigns--A\r\n     Dangerous Drive Home._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seemed at this time, that the ingenuity of man was put to the test to\r\ninvent some new species of entertainment. The winter in New York being\r\nso gay, people were in the vein for frolic and amusement, and feeling\r\nrich, as the currency was inflated, prices of everything going up,\r\nNewport had a full and rushing season. The craze was for drags or\r\ncoaches. My old friend, the Major, was not to be outdone, so he brought\r\nout four spanking bays; and again, an old bachelor friend of mine, a man\r\nof large fortune, but the quietest of men, I found one fine summer\r\nmorning seated on the box seat of a drag, and tooling four fine\r\nroadsters. But this did not satisfy the swells. Soon came two out-riders\r\non postilion saddles, following the drag; and again, several pairs of\r\nfine horses ridden by postilions _à la demi d’Aumont_. A turnout then\r\nfor a picnic was indeed an event. In those days, a beautiful spot on the\r\nwater, called “The Glen,” was often selected for these country parties.\r\nIt was a romantic little nook, about seven miles from Newport, on what\r\nis called the East Passage, which opens on the Atlantic Ocean.\r\n\r\nA young friend of mine, then paying court to a brilliant young woman,\r\ncame to me for advice. He wanted to impress the object of his\r\nattentions, and proposed to do so by hiring two of the fastest trotting\r\nhorses in Rhode Island, and driving the young lady out behind them to\r\nthe “Glen” picnic. His argument was, that it was more American than any\r\nof your tandem or four-in-hands, or postilion riding; that the pace he\r\nshould go at would be terrific, and he would guarantee to do the seven\r\nmiles within twenty minutes. He was what we call a thorough\r\ntrotting-horse man; much in love; worshipped horses; disliked style in\r\nthem, going in for speed alone. I tried to dissuade him.\r\n\r\n“It will never do,” I said; “it is not the fashion; the lady you drive\r\nout will be beautifully dressed, and you will cover her with dust;\r\nbesides, the pace will alarm her.”\r\n\r\n“Never fear that, my man,” he answered. “The girl has grit; she will go\r\nthrough anything. She is none of your milk-and-water misses; I can’t go\r\ntoo fast for her.”\r\n\r\n“Have it as you will, then,” I said; and off he went to Providence to\r\nsecure, through influence, these two wonderfully speedy trotters.\r\n\r\nWe were all grouped beautifully at the Glen, when, all of a sudden, we\r\nheard something descending the hill at a terrific pace; it was\r\nimpossible to make out what it was, as it was completely hidden by a\r\ncloud of dust. Down it came, with lightning speed, and when it got\r\nopposite to the Major and me, we heard a loud “Whoa, my boys, whoa!” and\r\nthe vehicle came to a stop. The occupants, a man and woman, were so\r\ncovered with mud and dust that you could barely distinguish the one from\r\nthe other. I ran up to the side of the wagon, saw a red, indignant face,\r\nand an outstretched hand imploring me to take her out. Seizing my arm,\r\nshe sprang from the wagon, exclaiming, “The horrid creature! I never\r\nwish to lay eyes on him again,” and then she burst into tears. Her whole\r\nlight, exquisite dress was totally ruined, and she a sight to behold.\r\nTurning to him, I saw a glow of triumph in his face; his watch was in\r\nhis hand. “I did it, by Jove! I did it, and ten seconds to spare!--they\r\nare tearers!”\r\n\r\nI quietly replied, “They are indeed tearers, they have torn your\r\nbusiness into shreds.”\r\n\r\n“Fudge, man!” he said; “she wont mind it; she was a bit scared, to be\r\nsure; but she hung on to my arm, and we came through all right.” He then\r\nsought his victim. I soon saw by his dejected manner that she had given\r\nhim the mitten, and, as I passed him, slowly walking his horses home, I\r\nphilosophized to this extent: “Trotting horses and fashion do not\r\ncombine.”\r\n\r\nOur next great day-time frolic was at Bristol Ferry. There we had a\r\nlarge country hotel which we took possession of. We got the best dinner\r\ngiver then in Newport to lend us his _chef_, and I took my own colored\r\ncook, a native of Baltimore, who had, at the Maryland Ducking Club,\r\ngained a reputation for cooking game, ducks, etc. We determined, on this\r\noccasion, to have a trial of artistic skill between a creole woman cook,\r\nthe best of her class, and the best _chef_ we had in this country. We\r\nwere to have sixty at dinner; dishes confined to Spanish mackerel,\r\nsoft-shell crabs, woodcock, and chicken partridges. It is needless to\r\nsay, the Frenchman came off victorious, though my creole cook contended\r\nthat the French _chef_ would not eat his own cooked dishes, but devoured\r\nher soft-shell crabs.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion we had a grand turnout of drags, postilions _à la demi\r\nd’Aumont_, and tandems. I led the cotillion myself, dancing in the large\r\ndrawing-room of the inn; and it all went so charmingly that it was late\r\ninto the night when we left the place. It was as dark as Erebus. We had\r\neleven miles to drive, and I saw that some of our four-in-hand drivers\r\nfelt a little squeamish. My old bachelor friend had in his drag a\r\nprecious cargo. On the box-seat with him sat our nightingale, and I had\r\nin my four-seated open wagon our queen of society and a famous Baltimore\r\nbelle. “Is the road straight or crooked?” I was asked, on all sides.\r\nHaving danced myself nearly to death, and being well fortified with\r\nchampagne, I found it straight as an arrow, as I was then oblivious to\r\nits crooks and turns. Off we all started up the hill at a canter. I\r\nremember my friend, the Major, shouting to me, “The devil take the\r\nhindmost,” and the admonition to him of his old family coachman, who\r\naccompanied him that day, “Be careful, sir, the road is not as straight\r\nas it might be.” Driving along at a spanking pace, the horses fresh, the\r\nladies jubilant, I as happy as a lord,--there was a scream, then\r\nanother, then a plunge, and a splash of water. Dark as it was, standing\r\nup in my wagon, I shouted, “By Jove! he has driven off the bridge,”--and\r\noff the bridge he was, drag upset and four horses mired in mud and\r\nwater. One young fellow, in the excitement of the moment, sprang to the\r\nside of my wagon, and tried to wrench off one of my lamps. How then I\r\nadmired the plucky, cool little woman at my side! She never lost her\r\npresence of mind for a second; gave directions quietly and effectively,\r\nand soon brought order out of chaos. From a jolly, festive procession,\r\nwe were turned into a sad, melancholy species of funeral cortège. The\r\nladies were picked out of the wreck, and placed in the different drags\r\nand wagons, and we wended on our way at a walk, ten dreary miles to\r\nNewport. One brilliant youth of the Diplomatic Corps, as we passed a\r\nfarm-house, making it just out in the dark, was asked to procure for our\r\ninvalids a glass of water. He rushed to the house, banging against the\r\ndoor, and shouting, “House, house, house, wont you hear, wont you hear?”\r\nThe old farmer poked his head out of the window, answering him, “Why,\r\nman, the house can’t talk! what do you want here at this time of night?\r\nI know who you are, you are some of McAllister’s picnickers. I saw you\r\ngo by this morning. I s’pose you want milk, but you wont get a drop\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\nAs picnics, country dinners, and breakfasts were then Newport’s\r\nfeature, they took the place of balls, all the dancing and much of the\r\ndining being done in the open air. I would here say that as every family\r\ntook to these parties their butler, and carried out the wines and all\r\nthe dishes, their cost in money was insignificant. We would pay\r\ntwenty-five dollars for the farm or grove to which we went for the day.\r\nTwenty-five dollars for the country band, as much for the hire of\r\nsilver, linen, crockery, etc., and ten dollars for a horse, wagon and\r\nman to take everything out, making the entire outlay in money on each\r\noccasion eighty-five to a hundred dollars. A picnic dinner and dance at\r\nmy farm, furnishing everything myself, no outside contributions, for\r\nfifty or sixty people, would cost me then three hundred dollars,\r\neverything included. What a difference to the present time! I got up one\r\nof these country dances and luncheons summer before last at my farm,\r\nwhere, under a pretty grove of trees, I had built a dancing platform\r\nfrom which you can throw a biscuit into the beautiful waters of\r\nNarragansett Bay. Lending the farm to the party, every one bringing a\r\ndish, hiring the servants and music, cost us in money eight hundred and\r\nsix dollars and eighty-four cents. There were 140 people present. The\r\nrailroad running through the farm, the train stopped on the place itself\r\nwithin a few rods of the group of trees. Leaving Newport at 2 P.M., in\r\nsix minutes we are on the place, and at a quarter of five the train\r\nreturned to us, thus ridding ourselves of coachmen and grooms, finding\r\nthem all at the railway station when we reached Newport on our return at\r\n5 P.M., to take us for our usual afternoon drive.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the past. When Newport was in its glory, and outshone\r\nitself, the young men of that day resolved to give me a lesson in\r\npicnic-giving. What they had done well in and about New York, they felt\r\nthey could do equally well in Newport, so they sent to the city for\r\nDelmonico with all his staff, and invited all Newport to a dance and\r\ncountry dinner at a large teahouse some six miles from Newport,\r\nadjoining Oaklands, the then Gibbs farm, later on the property of Mr.\r\nAugust Belmont, and now belonging to Mr. Cornelius Vanderbilt, being his\r\nmodel farm, one of the loveliest spots on Newport Island. Delmonico took\r\npossession of this huge barrack of a house, and to work his waiters went\r\nto arrange in the large, old dining-room his beautiful collation, which\r\nwas all brought from New York. The entire party were dancing the\r\ncotillion in the front parlor of the house, and grouped on its front\r\npiazzas. As 5 P.M. approached, an irresistible desire, an inward craving\r\nfor food, became apparent. Committeemen were beset with the question,\r\nwhen are we going to have the collation? They rushed off to hurry up\r\nthings, and then one by one reappeared with blanched faces, and an\r\nunmistakable anxious, troubled look. Finally they came to me with, “My\r\ndear fellow, what is to be done? Come and see for yourself.” Dragging\r\nme into the dining-room and pantries of the hotel I there indeed saw a\r\nsight to behold. All the coachmen and grooms had made a foray on the\r\nabundant supplies, tumbled Delmonico’s French waiters into the cellar of\r\nthe hotel, and locked them up; then, taking possession of the\r\ndining-room, held high carnival. Every mouthful of solid food was eaten\r\nup, and all the champagne drunk; the ices, jellies, and confectionery\r\nthey left untouched. As I viewed the scene, I recalled Virgil’s\r\ndescription of a wreck, “_Apparent rari in gurgite nantes_.” Every\r\ncoachman and groom was intoxicated, and, as the whole party at once took\r\nflight to secure dinner at home, the scene on the road beggared\r\ndescription. The coachmen swayed to and fro like the pendulum of a\r\nclock; the postilions of the _demi d’Aumonts_ hung on by the manes of\r\ntheir horses, when they lost their equilibrium. The women, as usual,\r\nbehaved admirably. As one said to me, “My man is beastly intoxicated,\r\nbut I shall appear not to notice it. The horses are gentle, they will go\r\nof themselves.” My old friend, the Major, at once held a council of war,\r\nand it was suggested that all turn in and thrash the fellows soundly,\r\nbut prudence dictated that at that work man was as good as master, that\r\nthe result might be doubtful; so all dolefully got away in the best\r\nmanner possible. The Major thus harangued his old family coachman:\r\n“Richard, I am astonished at you; the other men’s rascally conduct does\r\nnot surprise me, but you, an old family servant, to so disgrace\r\nyourself, shocks me.” The reply was, “I own up, Major, but indade, I am\r\na weak craythur.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOCIAL UNITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n     _Grand Banquet to a Bride-elect--She sat in a bank of Roses with\r\n     Fountains playing around her--An Anecdote of Almack’s--The way the\r\n     Duke of Wellington introduced my Father and Dominick Lynch to the\r\n     Swells--I determine to have an American Almacks’--The way the\r\n     “Patriarchs’” was founded--The One-man Power Abolished--Success of\r\n     the Organization._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two young women of the most distinguished bearing in my day in this\r\ncountry were, in my opinion, the one the daughter of our ex-Secretary of\r\nState and ex-Governor, the other the daughter of my friend, the Major.\r\nThey both looked as born of noble race, and were always, when they\r\nappeared, the centre of attraction. When the engagement of the Major’s\r\ndaughter was announced, one of her admirers asked me to go with him to\r\nCharles Delmonico, as he was desirous of giving this fair lady a\r\nBanquet, to commemorate the initial step she had taken in woman’s\r\ncareer. In the words of the poet, she was then\r\n\r\n    “A thought matured, but not uttered,\r\n    A conception warm and glowing, not yet embodied.”\r\n\r\nNow, all was to expand into noble womanhood, and she must needs put away\r\nchildish things and bid a sweet farewell to all who had worshipped at\r\nher shrine. This worshipper wanted to make this an occasion in her life,\r\nas well as his; so with Delmonico’s genius we were to conceive a banquet\r\nfor this fair maid, at which, like a Queen of May, she was to sit in a\r\nbower of roses. And this she literally did, placed there by her host, a\r\nscion of one of New York’s oldest families, whose family was interwoven\r\nwith the Livingstons, and by marriage closely connected with the great\r\nRobert Fulton. It was the first of these lavish and gorgeous\r\nentertainments, known as Banquets. Fifty-eight guests dining in\r\nDelmonico’s large ball-room; the immense oval table filling the whole\r\nroom, and covered with masses of exquisite flowers. There were three\r\nfountains, one in the centre, and the others at each end of the table,\r\nthrowing up a gentle spray of water, but always so planned that nothing\r\non the table in any way impeded the sight; one from all sides of it\r\ncould see over these beautiful flower-beds and through the spray. A\r\ncotillion followed the dinner, and then back all returned to the\r\ndining-room and supped as the early dawn crept on us.\r\n\r\nClose association at a small watering-place naturally produces jars.\r\nPeople cannot always agree. When you become very rich and powerful, and\r\npeople pay you court, it follows in many cases that you become exacting\r\nand domineering. It soon became evident that people of moderate means,\r\nwho had no social power to boast of, must needs be set aside and crowded\r\nout if the one-man power, or even the united power of two or three\r\ncolossally rich men, controlled society. One reflected that that would\r\nnot work. The homage we pay to a society leader must come from the\r\nesteem and admiration which is felt for him, but must not be exacted or\r\nforced. It occurred then to me, that if one in any way got out with the\r\npowers that be, his position might become critical, and he so forced out\r\nof the way as to really lose his social footing. Where then was the\r\nremedy for all this? How avoid this contingency? On reflection I reached\r\nthis conclusion, that in a country like ours there was always strength\r\nin union; that to blend together the solid, respectable element of any\r\ncommunity for any project, was to create a power that would carry to\r\nsuccess almost any enterprise; therefore, returning to New York for the\r\nwinter, I looked around society and invoked the aid of the then quiet\r\nrepresentative men of this city, to help me form an association for the\r\npurpose of giving our winter balls.\r\n\r\nAs a child, I had often listened with great interest to my father’s\r\naccount of his visit to London, with Dominick Lynch, the greatest swell\r\nand beau that New York had ever known. He would describe his going with\r\nthis friend to Almack’s, finding themselves in a brilliant assemblage\r\nof people, knowing no one, and no one deigning to notice them; Lynch,\r\nturning to my father, exclaimed: “Well, my friend, geese indeed were we\r\nto thrust ourselves in here where we are evidently not wanted.” He had\r\nhardly finished the sentence, when the Duke of Wellington (to whom they\r\nhad brought letters, and who had sent them tickets to Almack’s) entered,\r\nlooked around, and, seeing them, at once approached them, took each by\r\nthe arm, and walked them twice up and down the room; then, pleading an\r\nengagement, said “good-night” and left. Their countenances fell as he\r\nrapidly left the room, but the door had barely closed on him, when all\r\ncrowded around them, and in a few minutes they were presented to every\r\none of note, and had a charming evening. He described to us how Almack’s\r\noriginated,--all by the banding together of powerful women of influence\r\nfor the purpose of getting up these balls, and in this way making them\r\nthe greatest social events of London society.\r\n\r\nRemembering all this, I resolved in 1872 to establish in New York an\r\nAmerican Almack’s, taking men instead of women, being careful to select\r\nonly the leading representative men of the city, who had the right to\r\ncreate and lead society. I knew all would depend upon our making a\r\nproper selection.\r\n\r\nThere is one rule in life I invariably carry out--never to rely wholly\r\non my own judgment, but to get the advice of others, weigh it well and\r\nsatisfy myself of its correctness, and then act on it. I went in this\r\ncity to those who could make the best analysis of men; who knew their\r\npast as well as their present, and could foresee their future. In this\r\nway, I made up an Executive Committee of three gentlemen, who daily met\r\nat my house, and we went to work in earnest to make a list of those we\r\nshould ask to join in the undertaking. One of this Committee, a very\r\nbright, clever man, hit upon the name of Patriarchs for the\r\nAssociation, which was at once adopted, and then, after some discussion,\r\nwe limited the number of Patriarchs to twenty-five, and that each\r\nPatriarch, for his subscription, should have the right of inviting to\r\neach ball four ladies and five gentlemen, including himself and family;\r\nthat all distinguished strangers, up to fifty, should be asked; and then\r\nestablished the rules governing the giving of these balls--all of which,\r\nwith some slight modifications, have been carried out to the letter to\r\nthis day. The following gentlemen were then asked to become\r\n“Patriarchs,” and at once joined the little band:\r\n\r\nJOHN JACOB ASTOR,\r\nWILLIAM ASTOR,\r\nDE LANCEY KANE,\r\nWARD MCALLISTER,\r\nGEORGE HENRY WARREN,\r\nEUGENE A. LIVINGSTON,\r\nWILLIAM BUTLER DUNCAN,\r\nE. TEMPLETON SNELLING,\r\nLEWIS COLFORD JONES,\r\nJOHN W. HAMERSLEY,\r\nBENJAMIN S. WELLES,\r\nFREDERICK SHELDON,\r\nROYAL PHELPS,\r\nEDWIN A. POST,\r\nA. GRACIE KING,\r\nLEWIS M. RUTHERFORD,\r\nROBERT G. REMSEN,\r\nWM. C. SCHERMERHORN,\r\nFRANCIS R. RIVES,\r\nMATURIN LIVINGSTON,\r\nALEX. VAN RENSSELAER,\r\nWALTER LANGDON,\r\nF. G. D’HAUTEVILLE,\r\nC. C. GOODHUE,\r\nWILLIAM R. TRAVERS.\r\n\r\nThe object we had in view was to make these balls thoroughly\r\nrepresentative; to embrace the old Colonial New Yorkers, our adopted\r\ncitizens, and men whose ability and integrity had won the esteem of the\r\ncommunity, and who formed an important element in society. We wanted the\r\nmoney power, but not in any way to be controlled by it. Patriarchs were\r\nchosen solely for their fitness; on each of them promising to invite to\r\neach ball only such people as would do credit to the ball. We then\r\nresolved that the responsibility of inviting each batch of nine guests\r\nshould rest upon the shoulders of the Patriarch who invited them, and\r\nthat if any objectionable element was introduced, it was the\r\nManagement’s duty to at once let it be known by whom such objectionable\r\nparty was invited, and to notify the Patriarch so offending, that he had\r\ndone us an injury, and pray him to be more circumspect. He then stood\r\nbefore the community as a sponsor of his guest, and all society, knowing\r\nthe offense he had committed, would so upbraid him, that he would go\r\nand sin no more. We knew then, and we know now, that the whole secret of\r\nthe success of these Patriarch Balls lay in making them select; in\r\nmaking them the most brilliant balls of each winter; in making it\r\nextremely difficult to obtain an invitation to them, and to make such\r\ninvitations of great value; to make them the stepping-stone to the best\r\nNew York society, that one might be sure that any one repeatedly invited\r\nto them had a secure social position, and to make them the best managed,\r\nthe best looked-after balls given in this city. I soon became as much\r\ninterested in them as if I were giving them in my own house; their\r\nsuccess I felt was my success, and their failure, my failure; and be\r\nassured, this identifying oneself with any undertaking is the secret of\r\nits success. One should never say, “Oh, it is a subscription ball; I’m\r\nnot responsible for it.” It must always be said, “I must be more careful\r\nin doing this for others, than in doing it for myself.” Nothing must be\r\nkept in view but the great result to be reached, i.e. the success of the\r\nentertainment, the pleasure of the whole. When petitioned to curtail the\r\nexpense, lower the subscription, our reply has always been, “We cannot\r\ndo it if it endangers the success of the balls. While we give them, let\r\nus make them the great social events in New York society; make our\r\nsuppers the best that can be given in this city; decorate our rooms as\r\nlavishly as good taste permits, spare no expense to make them a credit\r\nto ourselves and to the great city in which they are given.”\r\n\r\nThe social life of a great part of our community, in my opinion, hinges\r\non this and similar organizations, for it and they are organized social\r\npower, capable of giving a passport to society to all worthy of it. We\r\nthought it would not be wise to allow a handful of men having royal\r\nfortunes to have a sovereign’s prerogative, i.e. to say whom society\r\nshall receive, and whom society shall shut out. We thought it better to\r\ntry and place such power in the hands of representative men, the choice\r\nfalling on them solely because of their worth, respectability, and\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA GOLDEN AGE OF FEASTING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n     _A Lady who has led Society for many Years--A Grand Dame\r\n     indeed--The Patriarchs a great social Feature--Organizing the F.

At\r\nthis period, a great personage (representing a silent power that had\r\nalways been recognized and felt in this community, so long as I\r\nremember, by not only fashionable people, but by the solid old quiet\r\nelement as well) had daughters to introduce into society, which brought\r\nher prominently forward and caused her at once to take a leading\r\nposition. She possessed great administrative power, and it was soon put\r\nto good use and felt by society. I then, for the first time, was brought\r\nin contact with this _grande dame_, and at once recognized her ability,\r\nand felt that she would become society’s leader, and that she was\r\nadmirably qualified for the position.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before circumstances forced her to assume the\r\nleadership, which she did, and which she has held with marked ability\r\never since, having all the qualities necessary,--good judgment and a\r\ngreat power of analysis of men and women, a thorough knowledge of all\r\ntheir surroundings, a just appreciation of the rights of others, and,\r\ncoming herself from an old Colonial family, a good appreciation of the\r\nvalue of ancestry; always keeping it near her, and bringing it in, in\r\nall social matters, but also understanding the importance and power of\r\nthe new element; recognizing it, and fairly and generously awarding to\r\nit a prominent place. Having a great fortune, she had the ability to\r\nconceive and carry out social projects; and this she has done, always\r\nwith success, ever ready to recognize ability and worth, and give to it\r\nadvice and assistance. Above all things, a true and loyal friend in\r\nsunshine or shower. Deeply interested in the welfare of this city, she\r\nlent herself to any undertaking she felt worthy of her support, and once\r\npromising it her aid, she could be always relied on and always found\r\nmost willing to advance its interests. With such a friend, we felt the\r\nPatriarchs had an additional social strength that would give them the\r\nsolidity and lasting powers which they have shown they possess. Whenever\r\nwe required advice and assistance on or about them, we went to her, and\r\nalways found ourselves rewarded in so doing by receiving suggestions\r\nthat were invaluable. Quick to criticise any defect of lighting or\r\nornamentation, or arrangement, she was not backward in chiding the\r\nmanagement for it, and in this way made these balls what they were in\r\nthe past, what they are in the present, and what we hope they may be in\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\nThe Patriarchs, from their very birth, became a great social feature.\r\nYou could but read the list of those who gave these balls, to see at a\r\nglance that they embraced not only the smart set, but the old\r\nKnickerbocker families as well; and that they would, from the very\r\nnature of the case, representing the best society of this great\r\ncommercial city, have to grow and enlarge. Applications to be made\r\nPatriarchs poured in from all sides; every influence was brought to bear\r\nto secure a place in this little band, and the pressure was so great\r\nthat we feared the struggle would be too fierce and engender too much\r\nrancor and bad feeling, and that this might of itself destroy them. The\r\nargument against them, the one most strongly urged, was that they were\r\noverturning all old customs; that New Yorkers had been in the habit of\r\ntaking an active part in society only when they had daughters to bring\r\nout, _lancée-ing_ their daughters, and they themselves taking a back\r\nseat. But that here in this new association, the married women took a\r\nmore prominent place than the young girls; _they_ were the belles of the\r\nballs, and not the young girls. This was Europeanizing New York too\r\nrapidly.\r\n\r\nHearing all this, and fearing we would grow unpopular, to satisfy the\r\npublic we at once got up a new association, wholly for the young girls,\r\nand called it The Family Circle Dancing Class. Its name would in itself\r\nexplain what it was, a small gathering of people in a very small and\r\nintimate way, so that unless one was in close intimacy with those\r\ngetting up these dances, they would have no possible claim to be\r\nincluded in them. Any number of small subscription parties had been\r\nformed, such as “The Ancient and Honorables,” “The New and Notables,”\r\n“The Mysterious,” and “The Fortnightlies.” All had been most enjoyable,\r\nbut short-lived. The F. C. D. C’s. were to be, in fact, “Junior\r\nPatriarchs,” under the same management, and were to be cherished and\r\nnourished by the same organization. They were given at first in six\r\nprivate houses. The first was held at Mr. William Butler Duncan’s; the\r\nsecond at Mr. Ward McAllister’s; the third at Mr. De Lancey Kane’s; the\r\nfourth at Mr. William Astor’s; the fifth at Mr. George Henry Warren’s,\r\nand the sixth at Mr. Lewis Colford Jones’s. I gave mine in my house in\r\nWest Nineteenth Street, and then saw what it was to turn a house inside\r\nout for a ball, and how contracted everything must necessarily be in a\r\ntwenty-five foot house, to receive guests in it, give them a _salle de\r\ndanse_ and a supper room, and then concluded that we must go in most\r\ncases to a good-sized ball-room to give an enjoyable dance.\r\n\r\nFrom the first, these dances were very popular. They gave the Patriarch\r\nballs the relief they required, and were rapidly growing in favor and\r\nthreatened in the end to become formidable rivals of the Patriarchs. The\r\nsame pains were taken in getting them up, as were given to the\r\nPatriarchs. We had them but for one season in private houses, and then\r\ngave them at Dodworth’s, now Delmonico’s. Later on, when this house\r\nchanged hands and became Delmonico’s, we gave them all there, with the\r\nexception of one winter when we gave them in the foyers of the\r\nMetropolitan Opera House. We made the subscription to them an individual\r\nsubscription, each lady and gentleman subscribing $12.00 for the three\r\nballs. One of them at Delmonico’s we made a “Mother Goose” Ball. It was\r\na species of fancy dress ball, powdered hair being _de rigueur_ for all\r\nladies who did not wear fancy costumes, and the feature of the occasion\r\nwas the “Mother Goose” Quadrille, which had been planned and prepared\r\nwith much skill and taste. This Quadrille was made up of sixteen\r\ncouples and was danced at eleven o’clock. As those who danced in it\r\npassed you as they marched from the hall into the ball-room, you found\r\nit a beautiful sight truly. Many of the men wore pink. Some of the\r\ncharacters were droll indeed. Among others, “Tom, Tom, the Piper’s son,”\r\nwith his traditional pig; “A man in the moon, who had come down too\r\nsoon”; one lady as “Twinkle, twinkle, little star”; “Mother Hubbard,” in\r\nan artistic costume of scarlet chintz; “Mary, Mary, quite contrary”;\r\n“Little Bo-Peep,” “The Maid in the garden hanging out the clothes,”\r\n“Punch and Judy”; “Oranges and Lemons”; while M. de Talleyrand appeared\r\nas a _mignon_ of Henry the Second. “Mother Goose” herself was also\r\nthere. The feature of the evening was the singing of the nursery rhymes.\r\nThe second was the “Pinafore” Quadrille introducing the music of that\r\noperetta. All the men who danced in it were in sailor’s dress. Then\r\nfollowed a Hunting Quadrille, in which every man wore a scarlet coat.\r\n\r\nI little knew what I was undertaking when I started these F. C. D. C.\r\nBalls. From the giving of the first of these dances, out of a private\r\nhouse, to the time of my giving them up, I had no peace either at home\r\nor abroad. I was assailed on all sides, became in a sense a diplomat,\r\ncommitted myself to nothing, promised much and performed as little as\r\npossible. I saw at once the rock on which we must split: that the\r\npressure would be so great to get in, no one could resist it; that our\r\nparties must become too general, and that in the end the smart set would\r\ngive up going to them. I knew that when this occurred, they were doomed;\r\nbut I fought for their existence manfully, and if I could here narrate\r\nall I went through to keep these small parties select, I would fill a\r\nvolume. My mornings were given up to being interviewed of and about\r\nthem; mothers would call at my house, entirely unknown to me, the sole\r\nwords of introduction being, “Kind sir, I have a daughter.” These words\r\nwere cabalistic; I would spring up, bow to the ground, and reply: “My\r\ndear madam, say no more, you have my sympathy; we are in accord; no\r\nintroduction is necessary; you have a daughter, and want her to go to\r\nthe F. C. D. C’s. I will do all in my power to accomplish this for you;\r\nbut my dear lady, please understand, that in all matters concerning\r\nthese little dances I must consult the powers that be. I am their humble\r\nservant; I must take orders from them.” All of which was a figure of\r\nspeech on my part. “May I ask if you know any one in this great city,\r\nand whom do you know? for to propitiate the powers that be, I must be\r\nable to give them some account of your daughter.” This was enough to set\r\nmy fair visitor off. The family always went back to King John, and in\r\nsome instances to William the Conqueror. “My dear madam,” I would reply,\r\n“does it not satisfy any one to come into existence with the birth of\r\none’s country? In my opinion, four generations of gentlemen make as good\r\nand true a gentleman as forty. I know my English brethren will not agree\r\nwith me in this, but, in spite of them, it is my belief.” With disdain,\r\nmy fair visitor would reply, “You are easily satisfied, sir.” And so on,\r\nfrom day to day, these interviews would go on; all were Huguenots,\r\nPilgrims, or Puritans. I would sometimes call one a Pilgrim in place of\r\na Puritan, and by this would uncork the vials of wrath. If they had ever\r\nlived south of Mason and Dixon’s line, their ancestor was always a near\r\nrelative of Washington, or a Fairfax, or of the “first families of\r\nVirginia.” Others were more frank, and claimed no ancestry, but simply\r\nwished to know “how the thing was to be done.” When our list was full,\r\nall comers were told this, but this did not stop them. I was then daily\r\nsolicited and prayed to give them the first vacancy. I did the best in\r\nmy power, found out who people were, and if it was possible asked them\r\nto join.\r\n\r\nThe little dances were most successful. Year by year they improved. They\r\nwere handsomer each season. We were not content with the small buffet in\r\nthe upper ball-room at Delmonico’s, but supped, as did the Patriarchs,\r\nin the large room on Fifth Avenue and Twenty-sixth Street, and literally\r\nhad equally as good suppers, leaving out terrapin and canvasback. But\r\nwhen the ladies organized Assembly Balls, we then thought that there\r\nwould perhaps be too many subscription balls, and the F. C. D. C. was\r\ngiven up.\r\n\r\nAt this time, when the F. C. D. C.’s were in high favor, I received the\r\nfollowing amusing anonymous lines of and about them:\r\n\r\n    He does not reign in Russia cold,\r\n      Nor yet in far Cathay,\r\n    But o’er this town he’s come to hold\r\n      An undisputed sway.\r\n\r\n    When in their might the ladies rose,\r\n      “To put the Despot down,”\r\n    As blandly as Ah Sin, he goes\r\n      His way without a frown.\r\n\r\n    Alas! though he’s but one alone,\r\n      He’s one too many still--\r\n    He’s fought the fight, he’s held his own,\r\n      And to the end he will.\r\n\r\n   --_From a Lady after the Ball of 25th February, 1884._\r\n\r\nJust at this time a man of wealth, who had accumulated a fortune here,\r\nresolved to give New Yorkers a sensation; to give them a banquet which\r\nshould exceed in luxury and expense anything before seen in this\r\ncountry. As he expressed it, “I knew it would be a folly, a piece of\r\nunheard-of extravagance, but as the United States Government had just\r\nrefunded me $10,000, exacted from me for duties upon importations\r\n(which, being excessive, I had petitioned to be returned me, and had\r\nquite unexpectedly received this sum back), I resolved to appropriate it\r\nto giving a banquet that would always be remembered.” Accordingly, he\r\nwent to Charles Delmonico, who in turn went to his _cuisine classique_\r\nto see how they could possibly spend this sum on this feast. Success\r\ncrowned their efforts. The sum in such skillful hands soon melted away,\r\nand a banquet was given of such beauty and magnificence, that even New\r\nYorkers, accustomed as they were to every species of novel expenditure,\r\nwere astonished at its lavishness, its luxury. The banquet was given at\r\nDelmonico’s, in Fourteenth Street. There were seventy-two guests in the\r\nlarge ball-room, looking on Fifth Avenue. The table covered the whole\r\nlength and breadth of the room, only leaving a passageway for the\r\nwaiters to pass around it. It was a long extended oval table, and every\r\ninch of it was covered with flowers, excepting a space in the centre,\r\nleft for a lake, and a border around the table for the plates. This lake\r\nwas indeed a work of art; it was an oval pond, thirty feet in length, by\r\nnearly the width of the table, inclosed by a delicate golden wire\r\nnetwork, reaching from table to ceiling, making the whole one grand\r\ncage; four superb swans, brought from Prospect Park, swam in it,\r\nsurrounded by high banks of flowers of every species and variety, which\r\nprevented them from splashing the water on the table. There were hills\r\nand dale; the modest little violet carpeting the valleys, and other\r\nbolder sorts climbing up and covering the tops of those miniature\r\nmountains. Then, all around the inclosure, and in fact above the entire\r\ntable, hung little golden cages, with fine songsters, who filled the\r\nroom with their melody, occasionally interrupted by the splashing of the\r\nwaters of the lake by the swans, and the cooing of these noble birds,\r\nand at one time by a fierce combat between these stately, graceful,\r\ngliding white creatures. The surface of the whole table, by clever art,\r\nwas one unbroken series of undulations, rising and falling like the\r\nbillows of the sea, but all clothed and carpeted with every form of\r\nblossom. It seemed like the abode of fairies; and when surrounding this\r\nfairyland with lovely young American womanhood, you had indeed an\r\nunequaled scene of enchantment. But this was not to be alone a feast for\r\nthe eye; all that art could do, all that the cleverest men could devise\r\nto spread before the guests, such a feast as the gods should enjoy, was\r\ndone, and so well done that all present felt, in the way of feasting,\r\nthat man could do no more! The wines were perfect. Blue seal\r\nJohannisberg flowed like water. Incomparable ’48 claret, superb\r\nBurgundies, and amber-colored Madeira, all were there to add to the\r\nintoxicating delight of the scene. Then, soft music stole over one’s\r\nsenses; lovely women’s eyes sparkled with delight at the beauty of their\r\nsurroundings, and I felt that the fair being who sat next to me would\r\nhave graced Alexander’s feast\r\n\r\n    “Sitting by my side,\r\n     Like a lovely Eastern bride,\r\n     In flower of youth and beauty’s pride.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENTERING SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n     _How to introduce a young Girl into Society--I make the Daughter of\r\n     a Relative a reigning Belle--First Offers of Marriage generally the\r\n     Best--Wives should flirt with their Husbands--How to be\r\n     fashionable--“Nobs” and “Swells”--The Prince of Wales’s\r\n     Aphorism--The value of a pleasant Manner--How a Gentleman should\r\n     dress--I might have made a Fortune--Commodore Vanderbilt gives me a\r\n     straight “Tip.”_\r\n\r\n\r\nI would now make some suggestions as to the proper way of introducing a\r\nyoung girl into New York society, particularly if she is not well\r\nsupported by an old family connection. It is cruel to take a girl to a\r\nball where she knows no one,\r\n\r\n    “And to subject her to\r\n     The fashionable stare of twenty score\r\n     Of well-bred persons, called the world.”\r\n\r\nHad I charged a fee for every consultation with anxious mothers on this\r\nsubject, I would be a rich man. I well remember a near relative of mine\r\nonce writing me from Paris, as follows: “I consign my wife and daughter\r\nto your care. They will spend the winter in New York; at once give them\r\na ball at Delmonico’s, and draw on me for the outlay.” I replied, “My\r\ndear fellow, how many people do you know in this city whom you could\r\ninvite to a ball? The funds you send me will be used, but not in giving\r\na ball.” The girl being a beauty, all the rest was easy enough. I gave\r\nher theatre party after theatre party, followed by charming little\r\nsuppers, asked to them the _jeunesse dorée_ of the day; took her\r\nrepeatedly to the opera, and saw that she was there always surrounded by\r\nadmirers; incessantly talked of her fascinations; assured my young\r\nfriends that she was endowed with a fortune equal to the mines of Ophir,\r\nthat she danced like a dream, and possessed all the graces, a sunbeam\r\nacross one’s path; then saw to it that she had a prominent place in\r\nevery cotillion, and a fitting partner; showed her whom to smile upon,\r\nand on whom to frown; gave her the _entrée_ to all the nice houses;\r\ncriticised severely her toilet until it became perfect; daily met her on\r\nthe Avenue with the most charming man in town, who by one pretext or\r\nanother I turned over to her; made her the constant subject of\r\nconversation; insisted upon it that she was to be the belle of the\r\ncoming winter; advised her parents that she should have her first season\r\nat Bar Harbor, where she could learn to flirt to her heart’s content,\r\nand vie with other girls. Her second summer, when she was older, I\r\nsuggested her passing at Newport, where she should have a pair of\r\nponies, a pretty trap, with a well-gotten-up groom, and Worth to dress\r\nher. Here I hinted that much must depend on her father’s purse, as to\r\nher wardrobe. As a friend of mine once said to me, “Your pace is\r\ncharming, but can you keep it up?” I also advised keeping the young girl\r\nwell in hand and not letting her give offense to the powers that be; to\r\nsee to it that she was not the first to arrive and the last to leave a\r\nball, and further, that nothing was more winning in a girl than a\r\npleasant bow and a gracious smile given to either young or old. The\r\nfashion now for women is to hold themselves erect. The modern manner of\r\nshaking hands I do not like, but yet it is adopted. Being interested in\r\nthe girl’s success, I further impressed upon her the importance of\r\nmaking herself agreeable to older people, remembering that much of her\r\nenjoyment would be derived from them. If asked to dance a cotillion, let\r\nit be conditional that no bouquet be sent her; to be cautious how she\r\nrefused the first offers of marriage made her, as they were generally\r\nthe best.\r\n\r\nA word, just here, to the newly married. It works well to have the man\r\nmore in love with you than you are with him. My advice to all young\r\nmarried women is to keep up flirting with their husbands as much after\r\nmarriage as before; to make themselves as attractive to their husbands\r\nafter their marriage as they were when they captivated them; not to\r\nneglect their toilet, but rather improve it; to be as coquettish and coy\r\nafter they are bound together as before, when no ties held them. The\r\nmore they are appreciated by the world, the more will their husbands\r\nvalue them. In fashionable life, conspicuous jealousy is a mistake. A\r\nwoman is bound to take and hold a high social position. In this way she\r\nadvances and strengthens her husband. How many women we see who have\r\nbenefited their husbands, and secured for them these advantages.\r\n\r\nA young girl should be treated like a bride when she makes her _débût_\r\ninto society. Her relatives should rally around her and give her\r\nentertainments to welcome her into the world which she is to adorn. It\r\nis in excessive bad taste for such relatives to in any way refer to the\r\ncost of these dinners, balls, etc. Every one in society knows how to\r\nestimate such things. Again, at such dinners, it is not in good taste\r\nto load your table with _bonbonnières_ and other articles intended to be\r\ntaken away by your guests. This reminds me of a dear old lady, who, when\r\nI dined with her, always insisted on my putting in my dress coat pocket\r\na large hothouse peach, which never reached home in a perfect state.\r\n\r\nThe launching of a beautiful young girl into society is one thing; it is\r\nanother to place her family on a good, sound social footing. You can\r\nlaunch them into the social sea, but can they float? “Manners maketh\r\nman,” is an old proverb. These they certainly must possess. There is no\r\nsociety in the world as generous as New York society is; “friend,\r\nparent, neighbor, all it will embrace,” but once embraced they must have\r\nthe power of sustaining themselves. The best quality for them to possess\r\nis modesty in asserting their claims; letting people seek them rather\r\nthan attempting to rush too quickly to the front. The Prince of Wales,\r\non a charming American young woman expressing her surprise at the\r\ncordial reception given her by London society, replied, “My dear lady,\r\nthere are certain people who are bound to come to the front and stay\r\nthere; you are one of them.” It requires not only money, but brains,\r\nand, above all, infinite tact; possessing the three, your success is\r\nassured. If taken by the hand by a person in society you are at once led\r\ninto the charmed circle, and then your own correct perceptions of what\r\nshould or should not be done must do the rest. As a philosophical friend\r\nonce said to me, “A gentleman can always walk, but he cannot afford to\r\nhave a shabby equipage.” Another philosopher soliloquized as follows:\r\n“The first evidence of wealth is your equipage.” By the way, his\r\ndefinition of aristocracy in America was, the possession of hereditary\r\nwealth.\r\n\r\nIf you want to be fashionable, be always in the company of fashionable\r\npeople. As an old beau suggested to me, If you see a fossil of a man,\r\nshabbily dressed, relying solely on his pedigree, dating back to time\r\nimmemorial, who has the aspirations of a duke and the fortunes of a\r\nfootman, do not cut him; it is better to cross the street and avoid\r\nmeeting him. It is well to be in with the nobs who are born to their\r\nposition, but the support of the swells is more advantageous, for\r\nsociety is sustained and carried on by the swells, the nobs looking\r\nquietly on and accepting the position, feeling they are there by divine\r\nright; but they do not make fashionable society, or carry it on. A nob\r\ncan be a swell if he chooses, i.e. if he will spend the money; but for\r\nhis social existence this is unnecessary. A nob is like a\r\npoet,--_nascitur non fit_; not so a swell,--he creates himself.\r\n\r\nThe value of a pleasant manner it is impossible to estimate. It is like\r\nsunshine, it gladdens; you feel it and are at once attracted to the\r\nperson without knowing why. When you entertain, do it in an easy,\r\nnatural way, as if it was an everyday occurrence, not the event of your\r\nlife; but do it well. Learn how to do it; never be ashamed to learn. The\r\nAmerican people have a _greater_ power of “catching hold,” and adapting\r\nthemselves to new surroundings than any other people in the world. A\r\ndistinguished diplomatist once said to me, “The best wife for a Diplomat\r\nis an American; for take her to any quarter of the globe and she adapts\r\nherself to the place and people.”\r\n\r\nIf women should cultivate pleasant manners, should not men do the same?\r\nAre not manners as important to men as to women? The word “gentleman”\r\nmay have its derivation from gentle descent, but my understanding of a\r\ngentleman has always been that he is a person free from arrogance, and\r\nanything like self-assertion; considerate of the feelings of others; so\r\nsatisfied and secure in his own position, that he is always\r\nunpretentious, feeling he could not do an ungentlemanly act; as\r\ncourteous and kind in manner to his inferiors as to his equals. The best\r\nbred men I have ever met have always been the least pretentious. Natural\r\nand simple in manner, modest in apparel, never wearing anything too\r\n_voyant_, or conspicuous; but always so well dressed that you could\r\nnever discover what made them so,--the good, quiet taste of the whole\r\nproducing the result.\r\n\r\nHere, all men are more or less in business. We hardly have a class who\r\nare not. They are, of necessity, daily brought in contact with all sorts\r\nand conditions of men, and in self-defense oftentimes have to acquire\r\nand adopt an abrupt, a brusque manner of address, which, as a rule, they\r\ngenerally leave in their offices when they quit them. If they do not,\r\nthey certainly should. When such rough manners become by practice a\r\nsecond nature, they unfit one to go into society. It pays well for young\r\nand old to cultivate politeness and courtesy. Nothing is gained by\r\ntrying roughly to elbow yourself into society, and push your way through\r\ninto the inner circle; for when such a one has reached it, he will find\r\nits atmosphere uncongenial and be only too glad to escape from it.\r\n\r\nA short time ago, a handsome, well-dressed Englishman, well up in all\r\nmatters pertaining to society, went with me to my tailor to see me try\r\non a dress coat. I was struck with his criticisms. Standing before a\r\nglass, he said, “You must never be able to see the tails of your dress\r\ncoat; if you do, discard the coat.” Again, he advised one’s always\r\nwearing a hat that was the fashion, losing sight of the becoming, but\r\nalways following the fashion. “At a glance,” he said, “I can tell a man\r\nfrom the provinces, simply by his hat.” If you are stout, never wear a\r\nwhite waistcoat, or a conspicuous watch-chain. Never call attention by\r\nthem to what you should try to conceal. In going to the opera, if you\r\ngo to an opera box with ladies, you should wear white or light French\r\ngray gloves. Otherwise, gloves are not worn. A _boutonnière_ of white\r\nhyacinths or white pinks on dress coats is much worn, both to balls and\r\nthe opera. My English friend was very much struck with the fact that\r\nAmerican women all sat on the left side of the carriage, the opposite\r\nside from what they do in England. “Ladies,” he said, “should always sit\r\nbehind their coachman, but the desire to see and be seen prompts them\r\nhere to take the other side. In this city some half a dozen ladies show\r\ntheir knowledge of conventionalities and take the proper seat.”\r\n\r\nI think the great secret of life is to be contented with the position to\r\nwhich it has pleased God to call you. Living myself in a modest, though\r\ncomfortable little house in Twenty-first Street in this city, a Wall\r\nStreet banker honored me with a visit, and exclaimed against my\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\n“What!” said he, “are you contented to live in this modest little house?\r\nWhy, man, this will never do! The first thing you must have is a fine\r\nhouse. I will see that you get it. All that you have to do is to let me\r\nbuy ten thousand shares of stock for you at the opening of the Board; by\r\nthree I can sell it, and I will then send you a check for the profit of\r\nthe transaction, which will not be less than ten thousand dollars! Do it\r\nfor you? Of course I will, with pleasure. You will run no risk; if there\r\nis a loss I will bear it.”\r\n\r\nI thanked my friend, assured him I was wholly and absolutely contented,\r\nand must respectfully decline his offer. A similar offer was made to me\r\nby my old friend, Commodore Vanderbilt, in his house in Washington\r\nPlace. I was a great admirer of this grand old man, and he was very fond\r\nof me. He had taken me over his stables, and was then showing me his\r\nparlors and statuary, and kept all the time calling me “his boy.” I\r\nturned to him and said, “Commodore, you will be as great a railroad\r\nking, as you were once an ocean king, and as you call me your boy, why\r\ndon’t you make my fortune?” He thought a moment, and then said, slapping\r\nme on the back, “Mc, sell everything you have and put it in Harlem\r\nstock; it is now twenty-four; you will make more money than you will\r\nknow how to take care of.” If I had followed his advice, I would now\r\nhave been indeed a millionaire.\r\n\r\nOne word more here about the Commodore. He then turned to me and said,\r\n“Mc, look at that bust,”--a bust of himself, by Powers. “What do you\r\nthink Powers said of that head?”\r\n\r\n“What did he say?” I replied.\r\n\r\n“He said, ‘It is a finer head than Webster’s!’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENTERTAINING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n     _Success in Entertaining--The Art of Dinner-giving--Selection of\r\n     Guests--A happy Mixture of Young Women and Dowagers--The latter\r\n     more Appreciative of the Good Things--Interviewing the Chef--“Uncle\r\n     Sam” Ward’s Plan--Mock Turtle Soup a Delusion and a Snare--The Two\r\n     Styles of cooking Terrapin--Grasshopper-fed Turkeys--Sourbet should\r\n     not be flavored with Rum--Nesselrode the best of all the Ices._\r\n\r\n    “We may live without love,--what is passion but pining?\r\n     But where is the man who can live without dining?”--\r\n                                 Owen Meredith.\r\n\r\nThe first object to be aimed at is to make your dinners so charming and\r\nagreeable that invitations to them are eagerly sought for, and to let\r\nall feel that it is a great privilege to dine at your house, where they\r\nare sure they will meet only those whom they wish to meet. You cannot\r\ninstruct people by a book how to entertain, though Aristotle is said to\r\nhave applied _his_ talents to a compilation of a code of laws for the\r\ntable. Success in entertaining is accomplished by magnetism and tact,\r\nwhich combined constitute social genius. It is the ladder to social\r\nsuccess. If successfully done, it naturally creates jealousy. I have\r\nknown a family who for years outdid every one in giving exquisite\r\ndinners--(this was when this city was a small community)--driven to\r\nEurope and passing the rest of their days there on finding a neighbor\r\noutdoing them. I myself once lost a charming friend by giving a better\r\nsoup than he did. His wife rushed home from my house, and in despair,\r\nthrowing up her hands to her husband, exclaimed, “Oh! what a soup!” I\r\nrelated this to my cousin, the distinguished _gourmet_, who laughingly\r\nsaid: “Why did you not at once invite them to pork and beans?”\r\n\r\nThe highest cultivation in social manners enables a person to conceal\r\nfrom the world his real feelings. He can go through any annoyance as if\r\nit were a pleasure; go to a rival’s house as if to a dear friend’s;\r\n“Smile and smile, yet murder while he smiles.” A great compliment once\r\npaid me in Newport was the speech of an old public waiter, who had grown\r\ngray in the service, when to a _confrère_ he exclaimed: “In this house,\r\nmy friend, you meet none but quality.”\r\n\r\nIn planning a dinner the question is not to whom you owe dinners, but\r\nwho is most desirable. The success of the dinner depends as much upon\r\nthe company as the cook. Discordant elements--people invited\r\nalphabetically, or to pay off debts--are fatal. Of course, I speak of\r\nladies’ dinners. And here, great tact must be used in bringing together\r\nyoung womanhood and the dowagers. A dinner wholly made up of young\r\npeople is generally stupid. You require the experienced woman of the\r\nworld, who has at her fingers’ ends the history of past, present, and\r\nfuture. Critical, scandalous, with keen and ready wit, appreciating the\r\ndinner and wine at their worth. Ladies in beautiful toilets are\r\nnecessary to the elegance of a dinner, as a most exquisitely arranged\r\ntable is only a solemn affair surrounded by black coats. I make it a\r\nrule never to attend such dismal feasts, listening to prepared\r\nwitticisms and “twice-told tales.” So much for your guests.\r\n\r\nThe next step is an interview with your _chef_, if you have one, or\r\n_cordon bleu_, whom you must arouse to fever heat by working on his\r\nambition and vanity. You must impress upon him that this particular\r\ndinner will give him fame and lead to fortune. My distinguished cousin,\r\nwho enjoyed the reputation of being one of the most finished _gourmets_\r\nin this country, when he reached this point, would bury his head in his\r\nhands and (seemingly to the _chef_) rack his brain seeking inspiration,\r\nfearing lest the fatal mistake should occur of letting two white or\r\nbrown sauces follow each other in succession; or truffles appear twice\r\nin that dinner. The distress that his countenance wore as he repeatedly\r\nlooked up at the _chef_, as if for advice and assistance, would have its\r\nintended effect on the culinary artist, and _his_ brain would at once\r\nact in sympathy.\r\n\r\nThe first battle is over the soup, and here there is a vast difference\r\nof opinion. In this country, where our servants are oftentimes\r\nunskilled, and have a charming habit of occasionally giving ladies a\r\nsoup shower bath, I invariably discard two soups, and insist to the\r\nprotesting _chef_ that there shall be but one. Of course, if there are\r\ntwo, the one is light, the other heavy. Fortunately for the period in\r\nwhich we live, our great French artists have invented the _Tortue\r\nclaire_; which takes the place of our forefathers’ Mock Turtle soup,\r\nwith forcemeat balls, well spiced, requiring an ostrich’s digestion to\r\nsurvive it. We have this, then, as our soup. The _chef_ here exclaims,\r\n“Monsieur must know that all _petites bouchées_ must, of necessity, be\r\nmade of chicken.” We ask for a novelty, and his great genius suggests,\r\nunder pressure, _mousse aux jambon_, which is attractive to the eye,\r\nand, if well made, at once establishes the reputation of the artist,\r\nsatisfies the guests that they are in able hands, and allays their fears\r\nfor their dinner.\r\n\r\nThere is but one season of the year when salmon should be served hot at\r\na choice repast; that is in the spring and early summer, and even then\r\nit is too satisfying, not sufficiently delicate. The man who gives\r\nsalmon during the winter, I care not what sauce he serves with it, does\r\nan injury to himself and his guests. Terrapin is with us as national a\r\ndish as canvasback, and at the choicest dinners is often a substitute\r\nfor fish. It is a shellfish, and an admirable change from the oft\r\nrepeated _filet de sole_ or _filet de bass_. At the South, terrapin\r\nsoup, with plenty of eggs in it, was a dish for the gods, and a standard\r\ndinner party dish in days when a Charleston and Savannah dinner was an\r\nevent to live for. But no Frenchman ever made this soup. It requires\r\nthe native born culinary genius of the African.\r\n\r\nNow when we mention the word terrapin, we approach a very delicate\r\nsubject, involving a rivalry between two great cities; a subject that\r\nhas been agitated for thirty years or more, and is still agitated, i.e.\r\nthe proper way of cooking terrapin. The Baltimoreans contending that the\r\nblack stew, the chafing dish system, simply adding to the terrapin salt,\r\npepper, and Madeira, produce the best dish; while the Philadelphians\r\ncontend that by fresh butter and cream they secure greater results. The\r\none is known as the Baltimore black stew; the other, as the Trenton\r\nstew, this manner of cooking terrapin originating in an old eating club\r\nin Trenton, N. J. I must say I agree with the Philadelphians.\r\n\r\nAnd now, leaving the fish, we come to the _pièce de resistance_ of the\r\ndinner, called the _relévé_. No Frenchman will ever willingly cook a\r\nladies’ dinner and give anything coarser or heavier than a _filet de\r\nbœuf_. He will do it, if he has to, of course, but he will think you\r\na barbarian if you order him to do it. I eschew the mushroom and confine\r\nmyself to the truffle in the treatment of the _filet_. I oftentimes have\r\na _filet à la mœlle de bœuf_, or _à la jardinière_. In the fall of\r\nthe year, turkey _poults à la Bordelaise_, or _à la Toulouse_, or a\r\nsaddle of Southdown mutton or lamb, are a good substitute. Let me here\r\nsay that the American turkey, as found on Newport Island, all its\r\nfeathers being jet black and its diet grasshoppers, is exceptionally\r\nfine.\r\n\r\nNow for the _entrées_. In a dinner of twelve or fourteen, one or two hot\r\n_entrées_ and one cold is sufficient. If you use the truffle with the\r\n_filet_, making a black sauce, you must follow it with a white sauce, as\r\na _riz de veau à la Toulouse_, or a _suprême de volaille_; then a\r\n_chaud-froid_, say of _pâté de foie gras en Bellevue_, which simply\r\nmeans _pâté de foie gras_ incased in jelly. Then a hot vegetable, as\r\nartichokes, sauce _Barigoule_, or _Italienne_, or asparagus, sauce\r\n_Hollandaise_. Then your _sorbet_, known in France as _la surprise_, as\r\nit is an ice, and produces on the mind the effect that the dinner is\r\nfinished, when the grandest dish of the dinner makes its appearance in\r\nthe shape of the roast canvasbacks, woodcock, snipe, or truffled capons,\r\nwith salad.\r\n\r\nI must be permitted a few words of and about this _sorbet_. It should\r\nnever be flavored with rum. A true Parisian _sorbet_ is simply “_punch à\r\nla Toscane_,” flavored with _Maraschino_ or bitter almonds; in other\r\nwords, a homœopathic dose of prussic acid. Then the _sorbet_ is a\r\ndigestive, and is intended as such. _Granit_, or water ice, flavored\r\nwith rum, is universally given here. Instead of aiding digestion, it\r\nimpedes it, and may be dangerous.\r\n\r\nA Russian salad is a pleasing novelty at times, and is more attractive\r\nif it comes in the shape of a _Macedoine de legumes_, Camembert cheese,\r\nwith a biscuit, with which you serve your Burgundy, your old Port, or\r\nyour Johannisberg, the only place in the dinner where you can introduce\r\nthis latter wine. A genuine Johannisberg, I may say here, by way of\r\nparenthesis, is rare in this country, for if obtained at the Chateau, it\r\nis comparatively a dry wine; if it is, as I have often seen it, still\r\nlusciously sweet after having been here twenty years or more, you may be\r\nsure it is not a genuine Chateau wine.\r\n\r\nThe French always give a hot pudding, as pudding _suedoise_, or a\r\n_croute au Madère_, or _ananas_, but I always omit this dish to shorten\r\nthe dinner. Then come your ices. The fashion now is to make them very\r\nornamental, a _cornucopia_ for instance, but I prefer a _pouding\r\nNesselrode_, the best of all the ices if good cream is used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMADEIRAS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n     _Madeira the King of Wines--It took its Name from the Ship it came\r\n     in--Daniel Webster and “Butler 16”--How Philadelphians “fine” their\r\n     Wines--A Southern Wine Party--An Expert’s shrewd Guess--The Newton\r\n     Gordons--Prejudice against Malmsey--Madeira should be kept in the\r\n     Garret--Some famous Brands._\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving had your champagne from the fish to the roast, your _vin\r\nordinaire_ through the dinner, your Burgundy or Johannisberg, or fine\r\nold Tokay (quite equal to any Johannisberg), with the cheese, your best\r\nclaret with the roast, then after the ladies have had their fruit and\r\nhave left the table, comes on the king of wines, your Madeira; a\r\nnational wine, a wine only well matured at the South, and a wine whose\r\nhistory is as old as is that of our country. I may here say, that\r\nMadeira imparts a vitality that no other wine can give. After drinking\r\nit, it acts as a soporific, but the next day you feel ten years younger\r\nand stronger for it. I have known a man, whose dinners were so famous by\r\nreason of his being always able to give at them a faultless Madeira,\r\ndisappear with his wine. When his wine gave out, he collapsed. When\r\nasked, “Where is Mr. Jones?” the ready answer was always given, “He went\r\nout with his ‘Rapid’ Madeira.”\r\n\r\nFamilies prided themselves on their Madeira. It became an heirloom (as\r\nTokay now is, in Austria). Like the elephant, it seemed to live over\r\nthree score years and ten. The fine Madeiras were fine when they reached\r\nthis country. Age improved them, and made them the poetry of wine. They\r\nbecame the color of amber and retained all their original flavor. But it\r\nis an error to suppose that age ever improved a poor Madeira. If it came\r\nhere poor and sweet, it remained poor and sweet, and never lost its\r\nsweetness, even at seventy or eighty years, while the famous Madeiras,\r\ndating as far back as 1791, if they have been properly cared for, are\r\nperfect to this day. We should value wine like women, for maturity, not\r\nage.\r\n\r\nThese wines took their names generally from the ships in which they came\r\nover. There is no more sensitive wine to climatic influences. A delicate\r\nMadeira, taken only a few blocks on a cold, raw day, is not fit to\r\ndrink; and again, you might as well give a man champagne out of a horse\r\nbucket, as to give him a Madeira in a thick sherry or claret glass, or a\r\nheavy cut glass. The American pipe-stem is the only glass in which\r\nMadeira should be given, and when thus given, is, as one of our\r\ndistinguished men once said, “The only liquid he ever called wine.” This\r\nought to be given as was done by the Father of the Roman Lucullus, who\r\nnever saw more than a single cup of the Phanean wine served at one time\r\nat his father’s table.\r\n\r\nA friend of mine once gave the proprietor of the Astor House, for\r\ncourtesies extended to him, a dozen of his finest Madeira. He had the\r\ncuriosity years after to ask his host of the Astor what became of this\r\nwine. He replied, “Daniel Webster came to my house, and I opened a\r\nbottle of it for him, and he remained in the house until he had drunk up\r\nevery drop of it.” This was the famous “Butler 16.”\r\n\r\nAs in painting there are the Murillo and Correggio schools, the light\r\nethereal conceptions of womanhood, as against the rich Titian coloring;\r\nso in Madeira, there is the full, round, strong, rich wine, liked by\r\nsome in preference to the light, delicate, straw-colored, rain-water\r\nwines. Philadelphians first took to this character of wine. They\r\njudiciously “fined” their wine, and produced simply a perfect\r\nMadeira,--to be likened to the best Johannisberg, and naturally so, it\r\nhaving similar qualities, as it is well known that the Sercial Madeira,\r\nthe “king pin” of all Madeiras, was raised from a Rhine grape taken to\r\nthe Island of Madeira. And here let me say, that “fining,” by using only\r\nthe white of a perfectly fresh egg and Spanish clay, is proper and\r\njudicious, but milk is ruinous. The eggs in Spain are famous, and are\r\nthus used.\r\n\r\nIn Savannah and Charleston, from 1800 up to our Civil War, afternoon\r\nwine parties were the custom. You were asked to come and taste Madeira,\r\nat 5 P.M., _after your dinner_. The hour of dining in these cities was\r\nthen always 3 P.M. The mahogany table, which reflected your face, was\r\nset with finger bowls, with four pipe-stem glasses in each bowl, olives,\r\nparched ground nuts and almonds, and half a dozen bottles of Madeira.\r\nThere you sat, tasted and commented on these wines for an hour or more.\r\nOn one occasion, a gentleman, not having any wine handy, mixed half\r\n“Catherine Banks” and half “Rapid.” On tasting the mixture, a great\r\nwine expert said if he could believe his host capable of mixing a wine,\r\nhe would say it was “half Catherine Banks and half Rapid.” This was\r\nafter fifteen men had said they could not name the Madeira.\r\n\r\nA distinguished stranger having received an invitation to one of these\r\nwine parties from the British Consul, replied, “Thanks, I must decline,\r\nfor where I dine I take my wine.”\r\n\r\nThe oldest and largest shippers of Madeira were the Newton Gordons, who\r\nsent the finest Madeiras to Charleston and Savannah. From 1791 to 1805,\r\ntheir firm was Newton Gordon, Murdock, & Scott. One hundred and ten\r\nyears ago, they sent five hundred pipes of Madeira in one shipment to\r\nSavannah. These wines sent there were the finest Sercials, Buals, and\r\nMalmseys. All those wines were known as extra Madeiras. The highest\r\npriced wine, a Manigult Heyward wine, I knew forty years ago; it was\r\nninety years old--perfect, full flavored, and of good color and\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nIn Charleston and Savannah from 1780 to 1840, almost every gentleman\r\nordered a pipe of wine from Madeira. I know of a man who has kept this\r\nup for half a century.\r\n\r\nThere is a common prejudice against Malmsey, as being a lady’s wine, and\r\nsweet; when very old, no Madeira can beat it. I have now in my cellar an\r\n“All Saints” wine, named after the famous Savannah Quoit Club, imported\r\nin 1791; a perfect wine, of exquisite flavor. My wife’s grandfather\r\nimported two pipes of Madeira every year, and my father-in-law continued\r\nto do this as long as he lived. When he died he had, as I am told, the\r\nlargest private cellar of Madeira in the United States. All his wines\r\nwere Newton Gordons. He made the fatal mistake of hermetically sealing\r\nthem in glass gallon bottles, with ground glass stoppers, keeping them\r\nin his cellar; keeping them from light and air, preventing the wine from\r\nbreathing, as it were. It has taken years for them to recover from this\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nMadeira should be kept in the garret. A piece of a corn cob is often a\r\ngood cork for it. Light and air do not injure it; drawing it off from\r\nits lees occasionally, makes it more delicate, but, if done too often,\r\nthe wine may spoil, as its lees support and nourish it.\r\n\r\nThe great New York Madeiras, famous when landed and still famous, were\r\n“The Marsh and Benson, 1809,” “The Coles Madeira,” “The Stuyvesant,”\r\n“The Clark,” and “The Eliza.” In Philadelphia, “The Butler, 16.” In\r\nBoston, “The Kirby,” the “Amory 1800,” and “1811,” “The Otis.” In\r\nBaltimore, “The Marshall,” the “Meredith,” or “Great Unknown,” “The\r\nHolmes Demijohn,” “The Mob,” “The Colt.” In Charleston, “The Rutledge,”\r\n“The Hurricane,” “The Earthquake,” “The Maid,” “The Tradd-street.” In\r\nSavannah, “The All Saints” (1791), “The Catherine Banks,” “The Louisa\r\nCecilia” (1818), “The Rapid” 1817, and “The Widow.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNES AND OTHER WINES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n     _Brût Champagne--Another Revolution in treatment of this Wine--It\r\n     must be Old to be good--’74 Champagne worth $8 a bottle in\r\n     Paris--How to frappé Champagne--The best Clarets--Even your Vin\r\n     Ordinaire should be Decanted--Sherries--Spaniards drink them from\r\n     the Wood--I prefer this way--The “famous Forsyth Sherry”--A\r\n     Wine-cellar not a Necessity._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fashionable world here have accepted the _Brût_ champagne, and avoid\r\nall other kinds; ladies even more than men. But another revolution is to\r\noccur in this country in the next five years in the treatment of this\r\nwine. We will soon follow the example of our English brethren and never\r\ndrink it until it is from eight to ten years old.\r\n\r\nA year or two ago one of the most fashionable men in London asked me to\r\nassist him in ordering a dinner at Delmonico’s. When we came to ordering\r\nthe wines, he exclaimed against the champagne. “What!” said he, “drink a\r\nchampagne of 1880. Why, it is too absurd!” I told him it was that or\r\nnothing, for we were far behind them in England, drinking new champagnes\r\nand having no old ones.\r\n\r\nThe idea is prevalent that champagne will not keep in this climate.\r\nAfter a few years one will always order his supply from abroad yearly,\r\nkeeping his champagne at his London wine merchant’s or at the vineyard.\r\nTo evidence the improvement in champagne by age, I can only cite that\r\nthe champagne of 1874 has sold in London at auction for $7 a bottle, and\r\nnow in Paris and London you pay $8 a bottle for a ’74 wine at a\r\nrestaurant, and $6 for an 1880 wine; at the vineyard itself $45 a dozen,\r\nand hard to obtain at this price. If you once drink one of these old\r\nchampagnes you will never again drink a fresh wine. In England they now\r\ndrink no Madeira; it is never served. At their dinners they pride\r\nthemselves on giving 1874 champagne. If they can give this wine, with a\r\nGolden Sherry and a fine glass of Port, they are satisfied.\r\n\r\nIt will be well to remember that champagnes are now known to\r\n_connoisseurs_ by their vintage. Wines of some vintages do not keep at\r\nall. In keeping champagnes, keep only, or order kept for you, the\r\nchampagnes of the best vintages. Of course, there is much risk in\r\nkeeping any champagne; but what all strive for, is to possess something\r\nthat no one else has; that is not purchasable, I mean, in any quantity,\r\nand this now is 1874 champagne.\r\n\r\nTo properly _frappé_ champagne, put in the pail small pieces of ice,\r\nthen a layer of rock salt, alternating these layers until the tub is\r\nfull. Put the bottle in the tub; be careful to keep the neck of the\r\nbottle free from the ice, for the quantity of wine in the neck of the\r\nbottle being small, it would be acted upon by the ice first. If\r\npossible, turn the bottle every five minutes. In twenty-five minutes\r\nfrom the time it is put in the tub, it should be in perfect condition,\r\nand should be served immediately. What I mean by perfect condition is,\r\nthat when the wine is poured from the bottle, it should contain little\r\nflakes of ice; that is a real _frappé_.\r\n\r\nIt is often a mistake to _frappé_, for it takes both flavor and body\r\nfrom the wine, and none but a very rich, fruity wine should ever be\r\n_frappéd_. My theory is that for ordinary cooling of wine, it is not\r\nnecessary to use salt, unless you are in a hurry. The salt intensifies\r\nthe cold and makes it act more quickly. You get a speedier result. I\r\nshould simply use above formula, omitting the salt. Champagne should not\r\nbe left in a refrigerator for several hours before being served, as it\r\ntakes away its freshness. In serving it, for one who likes it cold, the\r\nwine should be cooled sufficiently to form a bead on the outside of the\r\nglass into which it is poured. It is pretty, and the perfection of\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nIn regard to champagne of excellent years, we begin with 1857, as there\r\nwere no first-rate vintages of this wine between 1846 and 1857. The\r\ngreat years were: 1834, 1846, 1857, 1858, 1861, 1862, 1865, 1868, 1870,\r\n1872, and 1874, the last exceptionally fine and keeping well; 1878,\r\n1880, and 1884, fine wines; 1885 is fair, but not to be classed with the\r\n1884. The Romans noted the years of the celebrated growths of their\r\nwines, marked them on their wine vessels, when Rome was a Republic, with\r\nthe Consul’s name, which indicated the vintage. A celebrated vintage was\r\nthat of the year 632, when Opimius was Consul. It was in high esteem a\r\ncentury afterwards.\r\n\r\nIn clarets, we also make a mistake; we cling to them when by age they\r\nbecome too thin and watery. One fills up one’s wine cellar with claret,\r\nand then tenaciously holds it, until it frequently loses the fine\r\ncharacteristics of a first-class wine. The clarets of 1854 promised very\r\ngreat things, but were certainly a failure in Latour, and in some of\r\nthe other wines of that year; 1857, 1858, 1881, some were good. The\r\nclaret of 1865 was an extravagant wine, but developed a good deal of\r\nacidity, and is not to-day held in very high esteem, but I have tasted\r\nsome perfect of that year. 1868 promised much, but has not turned out as\r\ngood as was expected. 1869 sold at very low prices, but has become the\r\nbest wine of very recent years. 1870 was a very big, full-bodied wine;\r\nit is now very good. Of 1871, some of them are excellent (as Haut Brion,\r\nLafitte, Latour). The 1874’s were very good, Latour the best; 1875 was\r\nvery good; 1877, quite good; 1878, very good; 1879, only moderate; 1880,\r\nlight and delicate, quite good; 1881, big wines, very promising; 1884\r\npromised well, and 1887 promised to be great wines. I do not think it is\r\neasy to be certain of Bordeaux wines until they have been in bottles\r\nsome years. A wine which while in the wood may be excellent, may not\r\nripen the right sort of way in bottles and prove disappointing. Decant\r\nall your clarets before serving them, even your _vin ordinaire_. If at a\r\ndinner you give both Burgundy and claret, give your finest claret with\r\nthe roast, your Burgundy with the cheese. Stand up both wines the\r\nmorning of the dinner, and in decanting, hold the decanter in your left\r\nhand, and let the wine first pour against the inside of the neck of the\r\ndecanter, so as to break its fall. With Burgundy, the Clos Vougeots have\r\nrun out. The insect has destroyed them. The Chambertins or Romanée\r\nConti, when you give them to those who can appreciate fine wines, have a\r\ntelling effect.\r\n\r\nTable sherries should be decanted and put in the refrigerator one hour\r\nbefore dinner. Personally, as a table sherry I prefer to drink the new,\r\nlight, delicate sherries, as they come from Spain, directly from the\r\nwood, before they are darkened by being kept in glass, and before all\r\nthe water, that is always in them, has disappeared. This is the taste of\r\nthe Spanish people themselves. They drink them from the wood.\r\n\r\nThere is no need of having a large cellar of wine in this country, for\r\nwe Americans are such Arabs, that we are never contented to stay quietly\r\nat home and enjoy our country, and our own perfect climate. No sooner\r\nhave we built a charming residence, including a wine cellar, than we\r\nmust needs dash off to Europe, to see what the Prince of Wales is doing,\r\nso that literally a New Yorker does not live in his New York residence,\r\nat most, more than four or five months in the year. In the other seven\r\nor eight, his servants have ample time to leisurely drink up the wine in\r\nhis cellar, bottle by bottle; therefore, I advise against laying in any\r\nlarge supply of wine. Your wine merchant will always supply you with all\r\nwines excepting _old clarets_; these you must have a stock of; and, as\r\nservants do not take to claret, you are comparatively safe in hoarding\r\nup a good lot of it. Your old champagnes you can order from London, i.e.\r\na winter’s supply, every year, for as they say it will not keep in this\r\nclimate, you must do so to get it of any age. When sherry becomes old\r\nand has been kept some time in glass, they then drink it in Spain as a\r\n_liqueur_.\r\n\r\nIf you cannot get hold of the best, the very best and finest old\r\nMadeira, give up that wine and take to sherry. I have seen sherry that\r\ncould not be distinguished from Madeira by experts. Again, I have seen a\r\nsuperb sherry bring a hundred dollars a dozen. The most perfect sherry I\r\never drank was the “Forsyth sherry,” given to Vice-President Forsyth by\r\nthe Queen of Spain, when he was the American Minister at her Court. I\r\ngive during dinner a light, delicate, dry Montilla sherry. At dessert,\r\nwith and after fruit, a fine Amontillado.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDINNERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n     _Assigning Guests at Dinner--The Boston fashion dying out--The\r\n     approved Manner--Going in to Dinner--Time to be spent at\r\n     table--Table Decoration--Too many flowers in bad taste--Simplicity\r\n     the best style--Queen Victoria’s table--Her Dinner served at 8:15,\r\n     but she eats her best meal at_ 2 P.M.--_Being late at Dinner a\r\n     breach of good Manners--A Dinner acceptance a sacred Obligation--A\r\n     Visite de digestion._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Boston fashion adopted here for years, of one’s finding, on entering\r\nthe house in which he was to dine, a small envelope on a silver salver\r\nin which was inclosed a card bearing on it the name of the lady assigned\r\nto him to take in to dinner, though still in use, is, however, going out\r\nof fashion. We are returning to the old habit of assigning the guests in\r\nthe drawing-room.\r\n\r\nIn going in to dinner, there is but one rule to be observed. The lady of\r\nthe house in almost every case goes in last, all her guests preceding\r\nher, with this exception, that if the President of the United States\r\ndines with you, or Royalty, he takes in the lady of the house, preceding\r\nall of the guests. When no ladies are present, the host should ask the\r\nmost distinguished guest, or the person to whom the dinner is given, to\r\nlead the way in to dinner, and he should follow all the guests. The\r\ncards on the plates indicate his place to each one. By gesture alone,\r\nthe host directs his guests to the dining-room, saying aloud to the most\r\ndistinguished guest, “Will you kindly take the seat on my right?”\r\n\r\nThe placing of your guests at table requires an intimate knowledge of\r\nsociety. It is only by constant association that you can know who are\r\ncongenial. If you are assigned to one you are indifferent to, your only\r\nhope lies in your next neighbor; and with this hope and fear you enter\r\nthe dining-room, not knowing who that will be. At the table conversation\r\nshould be crisp; it is in bad taste to absorb it all. Macaulay, at a\r\ndinner, would so monopolize it that the great wit, Sydney Smith, said he\r\ndid not distinguish between monologue and dialogue.\r\n\r\nWhen the President of the United States goes to a dinner, all the guests\r\nmust be assembled; they stand in a horseshoe circle around the _salon_;\r\nthe President enters; when the lady of the house approaches him, he\r\ngives her his arm, and they lead the way to the dining-room, the\r\nPresident sitting in the host’s place, with his hostess on his right. On\r\narriving at the house where he is to dine, if the guests are not all\r\nassembled, he remains in his carriage until he is notified that they are\r\nall present. No one can rise to leave the table until the President\r\nhimself rises. If he happens to be deeply interested in some fair\r\nneighbor, and takes no note of time, the patience of the company is\r\nsadly tried.\r\n\r\nOn entering a _salon_ and finding yourself surrounded by noted or\r\nfashionable people, you are naturally flattered at being included; if\r\nthe people are unnoted, you are annoyed. The surprise to me is that in\r\nthis city our cleverest men and politicians do not oftener seek society\r\nand become its brilliant ornaments, as in England and on the Continent\r\nof Europe. Disraeli, Mr. Gladstone, Lord Palmerston, all were in society\r\nand were great diners out. In fact, all the distinguished men of Europe\r\nmake part and parcel of society; whilst here, they shirk it as if it\r\nwere beneath their dignity. They should know that there is no power like\r\nthe social power; it makes and unmakes. The proverb is that, “The way to\r\na man’s heart is through the stomach.”\r\n\r\nNow as to the length of a good dinner. Napoleon the Third insisted on\r\nbeing served in three-quarters of an hour. As usual here we run from one\r\nextreme to another. One of our most fashionable women boasted to me that\r\nshe had dined out the day before, and the time consumed from the hour\r\nshe left her house, until her return home, was but one hour and forty\r\nminutes. This is absurd. A lover of the flesh pots of Egypt grumbled to\r\nme that his plate was snatched away from him by the servant before he\r\ncould half get through the appetizing morsel on it. This state of things\r\nhas been brought about by stately, handsome dinners, spun out to too\r\ngreat length. One hour and a half at the table is long enough.\r\n\r\nA word about the decoration of the table. In this we are now again\r\nrunning from one extreme to the other. A few years ago, the florist took\r\npossession of the table, and made a flower garden of it, regardless of\r\ncost. Now, at the best dinners, you see perhaps in the centre of the\r\ntable one handsome basket of flowers; no _bouquets de corsage_ or\r\n_boutonnières_; the table set with austere simplicity; a few silver\r\ndishes with bonbons and _compotiers_ of fruit, that is all. Now,\r\nnothing decorates a dinner table as flowers do, and of these I think the\r\n_Gloire de Paris_ roses, the Rothschild rose, and Captain Chrystie’s the\r\nmost effective. A better result is produced by having all of one kind of\r\nflower, be it roses, or tulips, or carnations.\r\n\r\nIt is now the fashion to have the most superb embroidered table-cloths\r\nfrom Paris, in themselves costing nearly a year’s income. But it is to\r\nbe remembered that thirty years ago we imported from England the fashion\r\nof placing in the centre of the table a handsome piece of square scarlet\r\nsatin, on which to place the silver. At the dinner the eye should have a\r\nfeast as well as the palate. A beautifully laid table is very effective.\r\nI have seen Her Majesty’s table at Windsor Castle all ready for her. I\r\nhave heard her footmen, in green and gold, re-echo from hall to kitchen\r\nthe note that “dinner is served,” and then I was told to go; but I saw\r\nall I wanted to see. Her six footmen placed their hands on the little\r\nvelvet Bishop’s cap, which covered the lion and the unicorn in frosted\r\ngold on the cover of her six _entrée_ dishes; as dinner was announced,\r\nthis velvet cap was removed. The keeper of her jewel room has a large\r\nbook of lithographs of just the pieces of gold plate that are to\r\ndecorate Her Majesty’s table on different occasions, all regulated by\r\nthe rank of her guest. Her Majesty, in the time of Prince Albert, dined\r\nat 8:15. Her head _chef_ informed me then that her real dinner was eaten\r\nat 2 P.M., with the Prince of Wales, and it was for this he exercised\r\nhis talent. At eight and a quarter she took but soup and fish.\r\n\r\nIt is to be borne in mind that a host or hostess cannot be too courteous\r\nor gracious to their guests; and again, that guests in being late at\r\ndinner oftentimes commit a breach of politeness. Apropos of this, whilst\r\nin Paris one of our Ministers to the French Court related to me the\r\nfollowing anecdote, illustrating true French politeness. His daughter\r\narrived late at the dinner of a high personage. When her father\r\nremonstrated, she replied, “Did you not see that one of the family\r\narrived after us?” The next day our Minister heard that the Duchess,\r\nwith whom he had dined, had sent her daughter out of the room to come in\r\nafter them, to relieve them of any embarrassment at being late.\r\n\r\nAnother point has had some discussion. At a large dinner, where the only\r\nlady is the hostess, should she rise and receive each guest? This is\r\nstill a vexed question. Again, at a large dinner of men, is it incumbent\r\non every one present to rise on the entrance of each guest? On one\r\noccasion I failed myself to do this, not thinking it necessary. The\r\ndistinguished man who entered said afterwards that I had “slighted him.”\r\nIt was certainly unintentional. In a small room, if all get up, it must\r\ncreate confusion.\r\n\r\nIf you intend to decline an invitation to dinner, do so at as early a\r\ndate as possible. A dinner invitation, once accepted, is a sacred\r\nobligation. If you die before the dinner takes place, your executor must\r\nattend the dinner. (This is not to be taken literally, but to illustrate\r\nthe obligation.) The person to whom the dinner is given takes in the\r\nhostess, if she is present, going in first with her; that is, if it is\r\nonly men (no ladies present but the hostess). Should there be ladies, he\r\nstill takes in the hostess, but then follows all the guests; going in\r\nwith the hostess after all the guests. The only exception to this rule\r\nis where the President of the United States, or Royalty dines with you.\r\n\r\nIn England, in the note of invitation to dinner, you are never asked _to\r\nmeet any one_ but Royalty. The distinction of rank makes the reason for\r\nthis obvious. If Royalty dines with you, at the top of the note of\r\ninvitation, in the left hand corner, it is written: “To meet His Royal\r\nHighness,” or other Royalty. Our custom is otherwise. It is to invite\r\nyou to meet Mr. Robinson, or Mrs. Robinson, or Mr. and Mrs. Robinson.\r\nThis is accepted and approved by all in this country, for in this way\r\nyou are privileged to invite, at a day’s notice, any number of guests;\r\nfor one sees it is to meet a stranger, temporarily here; a sufficient\r\nreason for so short a notice to a large dinner; besides which you have\r\nit in your power to pay the stranger or strangers a compliment in a\r\npointed way, by making them or him the honored guest of that dinner.\r\n\r\nIf you propose accepting, your note of acceptance should be sent the day\r\nafter the invitation has been received. After dining at a ladies’ dinner\r\nit is obligatory that you leave your card at the house where you have\r\ndined, either the next day or within a day or two. This is called, by\r\nthe French, a _visite de digestion_. In England, this custom is dying\r\nout, for men have not the time to do it.\r\n\r\nI would here compare society to a series of intersecting circles; each\r\none is a circle of its own, and they all unite in making what is known\r\nas general society. Meeting people at a large ball is no evidence of\r\ntheir being received in the smaller circles. What the French call the\r\n_petit comité_ of good society is the inmost circle of all, but,\r\nnaturally, it is confined to a very few. Meeting a person constantly at\r\ndinner, at the most exclusive houses, should be sufficient evidence to\r\nyou that he or she is received everywhere, and if you find people\r\npersistently excluded from the best houses at dinners, you may be\r\nsatisfied that there is some good reason for it.\r\n\r\nWhen you introduce a man into the sanctuary of your own family, it is\r\nsupposed by a fiction to be the greatest compliment you can pay him; but\r\ndo not be misled by this, for there is nothing more trying to the guest\r\nthan to be the one outsider. A friend of mine invariably refuses such\r\ninvitations. “Why,” said he, “my dinner at home is sufficiently good; I\r\nam called out with my wife,--both of us compelled to don our best\r\nattire, order the carriage, and go to see and be with, whom? A family\r\nwhose members are not particularly interesting to us.” Men with whom you\r\nare only on a business footing you should dine at your Club, and not\r\ninflict them on your family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOOKS AND CATERING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n     _Some practical Questions answered--Difference between Men and\r\n     Women Cooks--Swedish Women the cleanest and most economical--My\r\n     bills with a Chef--My bills with a Woman Cook--Hints on\r\n     Marketing--I have done my own Buying for forty years--Mme.\r\n     Rothschild personally supervises her famous Dinners--Menu of an\r\n     old-fashioned Southern Dinner--Success of an Impromptu Banquet._\r\n\r\n\r\nTwenty years ago there were not over three _chefs_ in private families\r\nin this city. It is now the exception not to find a man of fashion\r\nkeeping a first-class _chef_ or a famous _cordon bleu_. In the last six\r\nyears Swedish women cooks have come over here, and are excellent, and by\r\nsome supposed to be better than _chefs_. No woman, in my opinion, can\r\ngive as finished a dinner as a man. There is always a something in the\r\ndinner which has escaped her. It is like German and Italian\r\nopera,--there is a finish to the Italian that the Germans can never get.\r\nBut Swedish cooks deserve special mention; they are really\r\nwonderful--cleanliness itself. That is where the French _chef_ fails. He\r\nmust have scullions tracking his very footsteps to keep things clean,\r\nwhile the Swedish woman does her work without making dirt. These women\r\nget nearly as large wages as the men,--sixty dollars a month and a\r\nscullion maid. What a contrast to living in France! I had the best\r\n_chef_ in Pau in 1856 for twenty-five dollars, and the scullion received\r\nthree dollars a month.\r\n\r\nThe question is often asked, What is the difference in expense to a\r\nhousehold between a _chef_ or a woman cook? This question is only\r\nlearned by experience, which teaches me that with a woman, my butcher’s\r\nbill would be $250 to $275 a month; with a _chef_, $450 to $500.\r\nGrocer’s bill, with woman cook, say, $75; with a _chef_, $125. This does\r\nnot include entertaining. For a dinner of twelve or fourteen one’s\r\nmarketing is easily sixty dollars, without the _foie gras_ or fruit. An\r\nA1 _chef_’s wages is $100 a month; he takes ten per cent. commission on\r\nthe butcher, grocer, baker, and milkman’s bill. If he does not get it\r\ndirectly, he gets it indirectly. In other words, besides his wages, he\r\ncounts on these commissions. I speak now of the ablest and best; others\r\nnot quite so capable take five per cent.\r\n\r\nAlways remember that the Frenchman is a creature of impulses, and works\r\nfor two things, glory and money. An everyday dinner wearies him, but a\r\ndinner _privé_, a special dinner, oh, this calls forth his talent, which\r\nshows that the custom some have of calling in and employing a _chef_ to\r\ncook them a special dinner is correct. If you do not keep a _chef_ out\r\nof respect for your purse or your health, it is a good plan to know of\r\nan “artist” whom you can employ on special occasions, with the express\r\nagreement that he submits the list of what he wants, and lets you make\r\nthe purchases, for these gentry like to make a little _economie_, which\r\nalways benefits themselves, and such _economie_ gives you poor material\r\nfor him to work upon, instead of good.\r\n\r\nHow often have I heard a hostess boast, “I never give any attention to\r\nthe details of my dinner, I simply tell my butler how many people we are\r\nto have.” In nine cases out of ten this is apparent in the dinner.\r\nMadame Rothschild, who has always given the best dinners in Paris,\r\npersonally supervises everything. The great Duchess of Sutherland, the\r\nQueen’s friend, when she entertained, inspected every arrangement\r\npersonally herself. I daily comment to my cook on the performance of the\r\nprevious day. No one, especially in this country, can accomplish great\r\nresults without giving time and attention to these details. No French\r\ncook will take any interest in his work unless he receives praise and\r\ncriticism; but above all things, you must know how to criticise. If he\r\nfinds you are able to appreciate his work when good, and condemn it when\r\nbad, he improves, and gives you something of value.\r\n\r\nNow let us treat of dinners as given before the introduction of _chefs_,\r\nand still preferred by the majority of people.\r\n\r\nThe best talent with poor material may give a fair dinner, but if the\r\nmaterial is poor, the dinner will evidence it. For forty years I have\r\nalways marketed myself and secured the respect of my butcher, letting\r\nhim know that I knew as much if not more than he did.\r\n\r\nIn selecting your shin of beef, remember that a fresh shin is always the\r\nbest for soup. In choosing fish, look at their gills, which should be a\r\nbright red.\r\n\r\nSee your _filet_ cut with the fat well marbled, cut from young beef.\r\nSweetbreads come in pairs; one fine, one inferior. Pay an extra price,\r\nand get your butcher to cut them apart and give you only the two large\r\nheart breads, leaving to him the two thin throat breads to sell at a\r\nreduced price.\r\n\r\nIn poultry there are two kinds of fat, yellow and white. Fowls fed on\r\nrice have white fat; those on corn meal, yellow fat. By the feet of the\r\nbird, you can tell its age.\r\n\r\nThe black and red feathered fowls are always preferred. Never take a\r\ngray feathered bird.\r\n\r\nLook at the head of the canvasback and the redhead; see them together,\r\nand then you will readily see the birds to pick, i.e. the canvasback.\r\nWeigh in your hand each snipe or woodcock; the weight will tell you if\r\nthe bird is fat and plump.\r\n\r\nIn buying terrapin, look at each one, and see if they are the simon-pure\r\ndiamond back Chesapeakes.\r\n\r\nIn choosing your saddle of mutton, take the short-legged ones, the meat\r\ncoming well down the leg, nearly reaching the foot; a short, thick,\r\nstubby little tail; must have the look of the pure Southdown, with\r\nblack legs and feet.\r\n\r\nOf hothouse grapes, I find the large white grapes the best, Muscats of\r\nAlexandria.\r\n\r\nParch and grind your coffee the day you drink it. Always buy green\r\ncoffee.\r\n\r\nNever use the small _timbales_ of _pâté de foie gras_, generally given\r\none to each guest. Always have an entire _foie gras_, be it large or\r\nsmall, for in this way you are apt to get old _foie gras_ thus worked\r\nup.\r\n\r\nAlways buy your _foie gras_ from an A1 house, never from the butcher or\r\nfruiterer.\r\n\r\nI here give as a recollection of the past the\r\n\r\n               Menu of an Old-fashioned Southern Dinner.\r\n\r\n          Terrapin Soup and Oyster Soup, Or Mock Turtle Soup,\r\n               Soft Shell Or Cylindrical Nose Turtle.[a]\r\n\r\n         Boiled Fresh Water Trout (Known With Us at the North\r\n                               As Chub).\r\n\r\n                 Shad Stuffed and Baked (We Broil It).\r\n             Boiled Turkey, Oyster Sauce. a Roast Peahen.\r\n                         Boiled Southern Ham.\r\n         Escalloped Oysters. Maccaroni With Cheese. Prawn Pie.\r\n                        Crabs Stuffed in Shell.\r\n                   Roast Ducks. a Haunch of Venison.\r\n\r\n                              _dessert._\r\n          Plum Pudding. Mince Pies. Trifle. Floating Island.\r\n                          Blanc Mange. Jelly.\r\n                              Ice Cream.\r\n\r\n [A] This turtle is only found in the ditches of the rice fields,\r\n and is the most valued delicacy of the South. It is too delicate to\r\n transport to the North. I have made several attempts to do this, but\r\n invariably failed, the turtle dying before it could reach New York.\r\n Its shell is gelatinous, all of which is used in the soup. It is only\r\n caught in July and August, and even then it is very rare, and brings a\r\n high price.\r\n\r\nOn repeatedly visiting the West Indies, I found that two of the best\r\nCarolina and Georgia dishes, supposed always to have emanated from the\r\nAfrican brain, were imported from these islands, and really had not even\r\ntheir origin there, but were brought from Bordeaux to the West Indies,\r\nand thence were carried to the South. I refer to the _Crab à la Creole_,\r\nand _Les Aubergines farcies à la Bordelaise_.\r\n\r\nAfter the great revolution, when the Africans of Hayti drove from the\r\nisland their former masters, good French cooking came with them to\r\nBaltimore, and other parts of the South. In talking of Southern dishes,\r\nI must not forget the Southern barnyard-fed turkey. They were fattened\r\non small rice and were very fine. In discussing Southern dinners, I\r\ncannot omit making mention of the old Southern butler, quite an\r\ninstitution; devoted to his master, and taking as much pride in the\r\nfamily as the family took in itself. Among Southern household servants\r\n(all colored people), the man bore two names as well as the woman. The\r\none he answered to as servant, the other was his title. Whenever, as a\r\nboy, I wanted particularly to gratify my father’s old butler, I would\r\ngive him his title, which was “Major Brown.” He was commonly called Nat.\r\nI remember, on one occasion, a guest at my father’s table asking Major\r\nBrown to hand him the rice, whilst he was eating fish. The old\r\ngray-haired butler drew himself up with great dignity, and replied,\r\n“Massa, we don’t eat rice with fish in this house.”\r\n\r\nSome features of the everyday Southern dinner were _pilau_, i.e. boiled\r\nchickens on a bed of rice, with a large piece of bacon between the\r\nchickens; “Hoppin John,” that is, cowpeas with bacon; okra soup, a\r\nstaple dish; shrimp and prawn pie; crab salad; pompey head (a stuffed\r\n_filet_ of veal); roast quail and snipe, and, during the winter, shad\r\ndaily, boiled, broiled and baked.\r\n\r\nAs there is reciprocity in everything, if you dine with others, they, in\r\nturn, must dine with you. Passing several winters at Nassau, N.P., I\r\ndined twice a week, regularly, with the Governor of the Bahamas. I\r\nsuggested to him the propriety of my giving him a dinner. He smiled, and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“My dear fellow, I represent Her Majesty; I cannot, in this town, dine\r\nout of my own house.”\r\n\r\n“Egad!” said I, “then dine with me in the country!”\r\n\r\n“That will do,” he replied; “but how will you, as a stranger, get up a\r\ndinner in this land, where it is a daily struggle to get food?”\r\n\r\n“Leave that to me,” I said. The Governor’s accepting this invitation,\r\nrecalled a story my father oft related, which caused me some anxiety as\r\nto the expense of my undertaking. A distinguished man with whom he was\r\nassociated at the bar was sent as our Minister to Russia; when he\r\nreturned home, my father interviewed him as to his Russian experience.\r\nHe said, that after being repeatedly entertained by the royal family, he\r\nfelt that it was incumbent on him, in turn, to entertain them himself;\r\nso he approached the Emperor’s grand Chamberlain and expressed this\r\nwish, who at once accepted an invitation to breakfast for the whole\r\nImperial family. “McAllister,” he said, “I gave that breakfast; I was\r\ncharmed with its success, but my dear man, it took my entire fortune to\r\npay for it. I have been a poor man ever since.”\r\n\r\nHaving this party on hand, I went to the _chef_ of the hotel,\r\ninterviewed him, found he had been at one time the head cook of the New\r\nYork Hotel in this city; so I felt safe in his hands. I went to work and\r\nmade out a list of all the French dishes that could be successfully\r\nrechaufféd. Such as _côtelettes de mouton en papillotte_, _vol au vent à\r\nla financière_, _boudins de volaille à la Richelieu_, _timbales de riz\r\nde veau_, _et quenelle de volaille_; a boiled Yorkshire ham, easily\r\nheated over, to cook which properly it must be simmered from six to\r\nseven hours until you can turn the bone; then lay it aside twelve hours\r\nto cool; then put it in an oven, and constantly baste it with a pint of\r\ncider. It must be served hot, even after being cut. The oftener it is\r\nplaced in the oven and heated the better it becomes. Thus cooked, they\r\nhave been by one of my friends hermetically sealed in a tin case and\r\nsent to several distinguished men in England, who have found them a\r\ngreat delicacy.\r\n\r\nI then hired for the day for $20 a shut-up country place; got plenty of\r\nEnglish bunting, quantities of flowers; saw that my champagne was of the\r\nbest and well _frappéd_; made a speech to the waiters and cook, urging\r\nthem to show these Britishers what the Yankee could do when put to his\r\nstumps; and then with a long cavalcade of cooks, waiters, pots, and\r\npans, heading the procession myself, went off to my orange-grove\r\nretreat, some five miles from Nassau, made my men work like beavers, and\r\nawaited the arrival of my sixty English guests, who were coming to see\r\nthe American _fiasco_ in the way of a country dinner and _fête_. In they\r\ncame, and great was their surprise when they beheld a table for sixty\r\npeople, _pièces montés_ of confectionery, flowers, wines all nicely\r\ndecanted, and a really good French dinner, at once served to them. I\r\nonly relate this to show that where there is a will there is a way, and\r\nthat you can so work upon a French cook’s vanity that he will, on a\r\nspurt like this, outdo himself.\r\n\r\nMarvelous to relate, the _chef_ positively refused to be recompensed.\r\n\r\n“No, sir,” he replied; “I am well off; I wish no pay. Monsieur has\r\nappreciated my efforts. Monsieur knows when things are well done. He has\r\nmade a great success. All the darkies on this island could not have\r\ncooked that dinner. I am satisfied.”\r\n\r\nI was so pleased with the fellow, that when he broke down in health he\r\ncame to me, and I had him as my cook two Newport summers. I kept him\r\nalive by giving him old Jamaica rum and milk fresh from the cow, taken\r\nbefore his breakfast,--an old Southern remedy for consumption.\r\n\r\nSome of his remarks on Nassau are worthy of repeating. I said to him,\r\n“_Chef_, why don’t they raise vegetables on this fruitful island? Why\r\nbring them all from New York?”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” he replied, “here you sow your seed at night, by midnight it\r\nis ripe and fit to cook; by morning it has gone to seed. The same way\r\nwith sheep. You bring a flock of sheep here, with fine fleeces of wool;\r\nin a few months they are goats, and not wool enough on them to plug your\r\nears.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBALLS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n     _The “Banner Ball”--How to prepare a Ball-room Floor--A curious\r\n     Costume and a sharp Answer--The Turkish Ball--Indisposition of\r\n     ladies to dance at a Public Ball--The Yorktown Centennial\r\n     Ball--Committees are Ungrateful--My Experience in this Matter--I\r\n     discover Mr. Blaine and introduce Myself._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1876, asked by a committee of eighty-two ladies to act as Manager of\r\na ball they were getting up at Chickering Hall, in aid of the\r\n“Centennial Union,” to be called the “Banner Ball,” I accepted their\r\nflattering invitation to lead so fair a band of patriots.\r\n\r\nOn examining the premises, I found that on a new floor they had put a\r\nheavy coat of varnish; there was nothing _then_ to be done but to\r\nsprinkle it thickly with corn meal, and then sweep it off, and renew the\r\ndressing from time to time. It is well to say here that if a floor is\r\ntoo slippery (which it often is, if hard wood is used and it is new),\r\nthere is nothing to be done but to sprinkle it with powdered\r\npumice-stone, sweeping it off before dancing on it; and again, if it is\r\nnot slippery enough, then, as above, give it repeated doses of corn\r\nmeal, and the roughest floor is soon put in good condition to dance on.\r\n\r\nThe opening quadrille of this ball was very effective. We formed in the\r\nsecond story of the Hall. I led the way to the ball-room with the\r\n“fairest of the fair,” the daughter of one of the most distinguished men\r\nin this country (who had not only been Governor of this State, but\r\nSecretary of State of the United States). We were surrounded by a noble\r\nthrong of old New Yorkers, all eager to view the opening quadrille. The\r\nladies were in Colonial costumes, representing Lady Washington and the\r\nladies of her court. As I walked through the crowded rooms, having on my\r\narm one of our brilliant society women, “a flower which was not quite a\r\nflower, yet was no more a bud,” we met approaching us a lady in indeed\r\ngorgeous apparel--so gorgeous, that the lady on my arm at once accosted\r\nher with, “Good gracious, my dear Mrs. B----, what have you got on? Let\r\nme look at you.” Her head was a mass of the most superb ostrich plumes,\r\nPrince of Wales feathers, which towered above her, and as she advanced\r\nwould bend gracefully forward, nodding to you, as it were, to approach\r\nand do her honor. Her dress, neck, and shoulders were ablaze with jewels\r\nand precious stones, and in her hand she carried an old Spanish fan,\r\nsuch as a queen might envy. The following reply to the query came from\r\nthis royal dame: “What have I got on? Why, Madame, I had a grandmother!”\r\n“Had you, indeed! Then, if that was her garb, she must have been\r\nPocahontas, or the Empress of Morocco!” The war of words beginning to be\r\na little sharp, I pressed on, only to meet another famous lady, whose\r\nbirthplace was Philadelphia, and who had had no end of grandmothers. She\r\nwore a superb dress of scarlet and gold, tight-fitting, such as was worn\r\nduring the Empire. Another young woman wore her great-grandmother’s\r\ndress, pink and brown striped brocade, cut like Martha Washington’s\r\ndress in the Republican Court, in which her great grandmother figured.\r\nThe wife of a prominent jurist, a remarkably handsome woman, with a\r\ngrand presence and a noble carriage, representing Lady Washington, wore,\r\nto all eyes, the most attractive costume there.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1877, a Southern woman of warm sympathies, great\r\ntaste, and natural ability, having married a young man of colossal\r\nfortune, was urged to take in hand the cause of the wounded Christians\r\nin the Russian-Turkish War, and raise funds to send to their relief. To\r\ndo this, she formed the “Society of the Crescent and the Cross,” and a\r\nball was given under her auspices at the Academy of Music, remembered\r\nin society as the “Turkish Ball.”\r\n\r\nThis lady did me the honor of making me the Chairman of the Floor\r\nCommittee of that ball. Consulting with her, we selected the members of\r\nthe opening quadrille, and took good care to choose the most brilliant\r\nwomen in this city. My partner was one of the greatest belles New York\r\nhas ever had, a woman of such air and distinction, such beauty of face\r\nand charm of manner, as we read of, but rarely see.\r\n\r\nOur quadrille, formed on the stage of this large opera house, with the\r\nguests of the ball filling the galleries and looking down on it, was no\r\nsooner over than I found we were in this dilemma: Our little quadrille\r\nwas left in full possession of the vast auditorium, and the question\r\nwas, how to get the people to leave the boxes and come down to us. It\r\nwas not in any way a full ball, and as the ladies who had danced in the\r\nquadrille at once retired to their boxes, they left me, as it were,\r\nsole occupant of the dancing floor. However, I rushed around and here\r\nand there collected dancing men, and succeeded in getting a respectable\r\nnumber on the floor, and infused spirit into the dancing.\r\n\r\nThe trouble in such cases is the indisposition of ladies to dance at a\r\npublic ball, other than in an opening quadrille. The ball, however, went\r\nmerrily on to a late hour.\r\n\r\nA few years later, I was asked to be one of the Floor Committee of the\r\nball to be given to the distinguished French and German officers who\r\ncame over to join in our celebration of the Centennial of the Battle of\r\nYorktown. This was the invitation:\r\n\r\n     _Office of the French Reception Commission, Room 7, Fifth Avenue\r\n     Hotel, New York, 28th October, 1881._\r\n\r\n     _Dear Sir:_\r\n\r\n     _The Commissioners appointed by the Governor of the State to extend\r\n     its courtesies to the guests of the Nation, request that you will\r\n     act as one of the Floor Committee on the occasion of the Ball to\r\n     be given at the Metropolitan Casino, on the evening of November 7._\r\n\r\n     _An immediate answer will oblige_,\r\n\r\n_Yours very respectfully_,\r\n\r\nWILLIAM JAY,\r\n_Chairman of the Ball Committee_.\r\n\r\n     _To Ward McAllister, Esq._\r\n\r\nExperience had taught me never to go on a committee in any social matter\r\nunless the committee was formed by myself, or made up of personal\r\nfriends on whom I could rely, and who would second and support me in my\r\nwork; for I well knew that it requires hard head-work and hand-work to\r\ncarry through to success any social project. Sometimes it happens--it\r\nhas often happened to me--that you have men on a committee with you who\r\nare wofully ignorant of the work they have undertaken to superintend,\r\nwho in one breath tell you “I know nothing about this business,” and in\r\nthe next criticise, discuss, and deluge you with useless and worthless\r\nsuggestions, and then, when they find they themselves can do nothing\r\nturn the whole matter over to you and tell you to “go ahead.” You do go\r\nahead and do their work, and then, when they find it is effectual, and\r\nthey see your efforts will be crowned with success, they quietly come in\r\nand appropriate the credit of it.\r\n\r\nHowever, on this occasion I agreed to act, as my duties were confined to\r\nforming the opening quadrille, and taking charge of the dancing. Picture\r\nto yourself a huge hall, one mass of human beings awaiting the opening\r\nof the ball, impatient of delay, anxious to dash off into the waltz,\r\ntempted by the inspiriting strains coming from a perfect band of one\r\nhundred well-trained musicians. Then, at one end of this vast hall, a\r\nstage filled with ladies in brilliant costumes, and foreign officers all\r\nin uniform; the Governor of the State, the Mayor of the City, and the\r\nchairmen of the various Yorktown committees; then your humble servant as\r\none of the Floor Committee, flitting from one group to another,\r\ninstructing each of them what they were to do. The position was indeed\r\ndroll. I stood behind the Governor, who was to all outward appearances\r\nconversing with General Boulanger, but was literally squeezing my hand\r\nand asking me what he was to do. One distinguished German general\r\npromptly said, “I go it blind! I will simply do what the others do.”\r\nThese were the forces I had to marshal and put through a quadrille. I\r\ndodged from one to the other and called out the figures, and breathed a\r\nsigh of relief when the dance was concluded.\r\n\r\nLooking around the galleries and scanning all the distinguished people,\r\nmy eye lit upon a wonderfully bright and intelligent face. Inwardly I\r\nsaid, “There is a man among men. Who can it be?” My curiosity was so\r\naroused that I went into his box, introduced myself to him as one of the\r\nFloor Committee, and said, “I have never seen you before; I know you are\r\na distinguished man. Pray who are you?” Laughingly, he replied, “I am\r\nJames G. Blaine.” “Well,” I said, “my instincts have not failed me this\r\ntime. I have heard and read of you for years. Now I see your genius in\r\nyour face.” Beauty in woman, genius in man, happily I never fail to\r\ndiscover.\r\n\r\nThe invitation to this ball was as follows:\r\n\r\n     [Coat of Arms of the State of New York.]\r\n\r\n     _BALL._\r\n\r\n     _The Commissioners appointed by the State of New York request the\r\n     honor of your presence to meet the Guests of the Nation at the\r\n     Metropolitan Casino on the evening of Monday, November 7, at ten\r\n     o’clock._\r\n\r\n     _New York, 19th of October, 1881._\r\n\r\nSome of the distinguished guests of the Nation were M. Max Outrey,\r\nMinistre Plenipotentiare de la France aux Etats-Unis, M. le Marquis de\r\nRochambeau, General Boulanger, le Comte de Beaumont, and le Comte de\r\nCorcelle, representing the Lafayettes, and Colonel A. von Steuben,\r\nrepresenting the family of Major-General von Steuben.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMOUS NEWPORT BALLS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n     _A Famous Newport Ball--Exquisite effect produced by blocks of Ice\r\n     and Electric Lights--The Japanese room--Corners for “Flirtation\r\n     couples”--A superb Supper--Secretary Frelinghuysen in the\r\n     Barber-shop--I meet Attorney-General Brewster--A Remarkable Man--I\r\n     entertain him at Newport--A young Admirer gives him a Banquet in\r\n     New York--Transformation of the Banquet-hall into a Ball-room._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next great event in the fashionable world was a Newport ball. A lady\r\nwho had married a man of cultivation and taste, a member of one of New\r\nYork’s oldest families, who had inherited from her father an enormous\r\nfortune, was at once seized with the ambition to take and hold a\r\nbrilliant social position, to gratify which she built one of the\r\nhandsomest houses in this city, importing interiors from Europe for it,\r\nand such old Spanish tapestries as had never before been introduced into\r\nNew York; after which she went to Newport, and bought a beautiful villa\r\non Bellevue Avenue, and there gave, in the grounds of that villa, the\r\nhandsomest ball that had ever been given there. The villa itself was\r\nonly used to receive and sup the guests in, for a huge tent, capable of\r\nholding fifteen hundred people, had been spread over the entire villa\r\ngrounds, and in it was built a platform for dancing. The approaches to\r\nthis tent were admirably designed, and produced a great effect. On\r\nentering the villa itself, you were received by the hostess, and then\r\ndirected by liveried servants to the two improvised _salons_ of the\r\ntent. The one you first entered was the Japanese room, adorned by every\r\nconceivable kind of old Japanese objects of art, couches, hangings of\r\nembroideries, cunning cane houses, all illuminated with Japanese\r\nlanterns, and the ceiling canopied with Japanese stuffs, producing, with\r\nits soft reddish light, a charming effect; then, behind tables\r\nscattered in different parts of the room, stood Japanese boys in\r\ncostume, serving fragrant tea. Every possible couch, lounge, and\r\neasy-chair was there to invite you to sit and indulge yourself in ease\r\nand repose.\r\n\r\nLeaving this ante-room, you entered still another _salon_, adorned with\r\nmodern and Parisian furniture, but furnished with cunningly devised\r\ncorners and nooks for “flirtation couples”; and from this you were\r\nushered into the gorgeous ball-room itself,--an immense open tent, whose\r\nceiling and sides were composed of broad stripes of white and scarlet\r\nbunting; then, for the first time at a ball in this country, the\r\nelectric light was introduced, with brilliant effect. Two grottos of\r\nimmense blocks of ice stood on either side of the ball-room, and a\r\npowerful jet of light was thrown through each of them, causing the ice\r\nto resemble the prisms of an illuminated cavern, and fairly to dazzle\r\none with their coloring. Then as the blocks of ice would melt, they\r\nwould tumble over each other in charming glacier-like confusion, giving\r\nyou winter in the lap of summer; for every species of plant stood around\r\nthis immense floor, as a flowering border, creeping quite up to these\r\nlittle improvised glaciers. The light was thrown and spread by these two\r\npowerful jets, sufficiently strong to give a brilliant illumination to\r\nthe ball-room. The only criticism possible was, that it made deep\r\nshadows.\r\n\r\nAll Newport was present to give brilliancy to the scene. Everything was\r\nto be European, so one supped at small tables as at a ball in Paris, all\r\nthrough the night. Supper was ready at the opening of the ball, and also\r\nas complete and as well served at the finish, by daylight. Newport had\r\nnever seen before, and has never since seen, anything as dazzling and\r\nbrilliant, as well conceived, and as well carried out, in every detail.\r\n\r\nDesirous of obtaining an office from the administration of President\r\nArthur, I went to Washington with letters to the President and his\r\nAttorney-General. On my arrival, depositing my luggage in my room at\r\nWillard’s, I descended to the modest little barber-shop of that hotel,\r\nand there, in the hands of a colored barber, I saw our distinguished\r\nSecretary of State, the Hon. Frederick T. Frelinghuysen, who, on\r\ncatching sight of me, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Halloa, my friend! what brings you here?” He had for years been my\r\nlawyer in New Jersey.\r\n\r\nI replied: “I want an office.”\r\n\r\n“Well, what office?”\r\n\r\nI told him what I wanted.\r\n\r\n“I hope you do not expect me to get it for you!” he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Not exactly,” I answered. “My man is the Attorney-General, and I want\r\nyou to tell me where I can find him.”\r\n\r\n“Find him! why, that’s easy enough; there is not another such man in\r\nWashington. Where do you dine?”\r\n\r\n“Here in this house, at seven.”\r\n\r\n“He dines here at the same hour. All you have to do is to look about you\r\nthen, and when you see an old-fashioned, courtly gentleman of the\r\nBenjamin Franklin style, you will see Brewster,” said Mr. Frelinghuysen.\r\n\r\nWhile quietly taking my soup, I saw an apparition! In walked a stately,\r\nhandsome woman, by her side an old-fashioned, courtly gentleman, in a\r\nblack velvet sack coat, ruffled shirt, and ruffled wristbands,\r\naccompanied by a small boy, evidently their son. “There he is,” I said\r\nto myself. Now, I make it a rule never to disturb any one until they\r\nhave taken off the edge of their appetite. I stealthily viewed the man\r\non whom my hopes hinged. Remarkable to look at he was. A thoroughly\r\nwell-dressed man, with the unmistakable air of a gentleman and a man of\r\nculture. As he spoke he gesticulated, and even with his family, he\r\nseemingly kept up the liveliest of conversations. No sooner had he\r\nreached his coffee, than I reached him. In five minutes I was as much at\r\nhome with him as if I had known him for five years.\r\n\r\n“Well, my dear sir,” he said, “what made you go first to Frelinghuysen?\r\nWhy did you not come at once to me? I know all about you; my friends are\r\nyour friends. I know what you want. The office you wish, I will see that\r\nyou get. Our good President will sanction what I do. The office is\r\nyours. Say no more about it.” From that hour this glorious old man and\r\nmyself were sworn friends; I was here simply carrying out the axiom to\r\nkeep one’s friendships in repair; and, as he had done so much for me, I\r\nresolved, in turn, to do all I could for him, and I know I made the\r\nevening of his life, at least, one of pleasurable and quiet enjoyment.\r\nHe came to me that summer at Newport, and the life he there led among\r\nfashionable people seemed to be a new awakening to him of cultivated and\r\nrefined enjoyment. He found himself among people there who appreciated\r\nhis well-stored mind and his great learning. He was the brightest and\r\nbest conversationalist I have ever met with. His memory was marvelous;\r\nevery little incident of everyday life would bring forth some poetical\r\nillustrations from his mental storehouse.\r\n\r\nAt a large dinner I gave him, to which I had invited General Hancock and\r\none of the Judges of the Supreme Court of the United States, the\r\nquestion of precedence presented itself. I sent in the Judge before the\r\nGeneral, and being criticised for this, I appealed to the General\r\nhimself. “In Washington,” he said, “I have been sent in to dinner on\r\nmany occasions before our Supreme Court Judges, and again on other\r\noccasions they have preceded me. There is no fixed rule; but I am\r\ninclined to think I have precedence.”\r\n\r\nDuring this summer, a young friend of mine was so charmed with the\r\nAttorney-General, that he advised with me about giving him an\r\nexceptionally handsome entertainment. This idea took shape the following\r\nwinter, when he came and asked me to assist him in getting up for him a\r\nsuperb banquet at Delmonico’s. He wanted the brilliant people of society\r\nto be invited to it, and no pains or expense to be spared to make it the\r\naffair of the winter. I felt that our distinguished citizen, the\r\nex-Secretary of State and ex-Governor, who had so long held political as\r\nwell as social power, and his wife, should be asked to preside over it,\r\nand thus expressed myself to him, and was requested to ask them to do\r\nso. I presented myself to this most affable and courtly lady in her\r\nsunshiny drawing-room on Second Avenue, and proffered my request. She\r\ngraciously accepted the invitation, saying she well knew the gentleman\r\nand his family as old New Yorkers; and to preside over a dinner given to\r\nher old friend, Mr. Brewster, would really give her the greatest\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nGreat care was taken in the selection of the guests. New York sent to\r\nthis feast the brilliant men and women of that day, and the feast was\r\nworthy of them. The “I” table (shape of letter I) was literally a garden\r\nof superb roses; a border of heartsease, the width of one’s hand,\r\nencircled it, and was most artistic. Delmonico’s ball-room, where we\r\ndined, had never been so elaborately decorated. The mural decorations\r\nwere superb; placques of lilies of the valley, of tulips, and of azaleas\r\nadorned the walls; and the dinner itself was pronounced the best effort\r\nof Delmonico’s _chefs_. What added much to the general effect was on\r\nleaving the table for a short half-hour to find the same dining-room,\r\nin that short space of time, converted into a brilliant ball-room, all\r\nfull of the guests of the Patriarchs, and a ball under full headway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ERA OF EXTRAVAGANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n     _New Era in New York Society--Extravagance of Living--Grand Fancy\r\n     Dress Ball in Fifth Avenue--I go as the Lover of Margaret de\r\n     Valois--A Great Journalist at Newport--A British Officer rides into\r\n     a Club House--The great Journalist’s masked Ball--A mysterious Blue\r\n     Domino--Breakfast at Southwick’s Grove to the Duke of\r\n     Beaufort--Picnic given President Arthur--His hearty Enjoyment of\r\n     it--Governor Morgan misjudges my “Open Air Lunches.”--The Pleasure\r\n     of Country Frolics._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe here reach a period when New York society turned over a new leaf. Up\r\nto this time, for one to be worth a million of dollars was to be rated\r\nas a man of fortune, but now, bygones must be bygones. New York’s ideas\r\nas to values, when fortune was named, leaped boldly up to ten millions,\r\nfifty millions, one hundred millions, and the necessities and luxuries\r\nfollowed suit. One was no longer content with a dinner of a dozen or\r\nmore, to be served by a couple of servants. Fashion demanded that you be\r\nreceived in the hall of the house in which you were to dine, by from\r\nfive to six servants, who, with the butler, were to serve the repast.\r\nThe butler, on such occasions, to do alone the head-work, and under him\r\nhe had these men in livery to serve the dinner, he to guide and direct\r\nthem. Soft strains of music were introduced between the courses, and in\r\nsome houses gold replaced silver in the way of plate, and everything\r\nthat skill and art could suggest was added to make the dinners not a\r\nvulgar display, but a great gastronomic effort, evidencing the\r\npossession by the host of both money and taste.\r\n\r\nThe butler from getting a salary of $40 a month received then from $60\r\nto $75 a month. The second man jumped up from $20 to $35 and $40, and\r\nthe extra men, at the dinner of a dozen people or more, would cost $24.\r\nThen the orchids, being the most costly of all flowers, were introduced\r\nin profusion. The canvasback, that we could buy at $2.50 a pair, went\r\nup to $8 a pair; the terrapin were $4 apiece. Our forefathers would have\r\nbeen staggered at the cost of the hospitality of these days.\r\n\r\nLady Mandeville came over to us at this epoch, and at once a superb\r\nfancy ball was announced by one of our fashionable rich men. Every\r\nartist in the city was set to work to design novel costumes--to produce\r\nsomething in the way of a fancy dress that would make its wearer live\r\never after in history. Determining not to be outdone, I went to a fair\r\ndowager, who was up in all things; asked for and followed her advice.\r\n“Mapleson is your man. Put yourself in his hands,” said she; so off I\r\nwent to him, and there I found myself, not only in his hands, but under\r\nthe inspection of a fine pair of female eyes, who sat by his side and\r\nessayed to prompt him as to what my dress should be.\r\n\r\n“Why, man alive!” said she, “don’t you see he is a Huguenot all over,\r\nan admirer of our sex. Put him in the guise of some woman’s lover.”\r\n\r\n“By Jove, you are right, my fair songster!” said Mapleson. “I’ll make\r\nhim the lover of Marguerite de Valois, who was guillotined at thirty-six\r\nbecause he loved ‘not wisely, but too well.’ Pray, what is your age?”\r\n\r\n“Young enough, my dear sir, to suit your purpose. Go ahead, and make of\r\nme what you will,” I replied.\r\n\r\n“Have you a good pair of legs?”\r\n\r\n“Aye, that I have! But at times they are a little groggy. Covering they\r\nmust have.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, my boy, we will fix you. Buckskin will do your business. With\r\ntights of white chamois and silk hose, you can defy cold.” So into the\r\nbusiness I went; and when my good friend the Attorney-General came into\r\nmy room, and saw two sturdy fellows on either side of me holding up a\r\npair of leather trunks, I on a step-ladder, one mass of powder,\r\ndescending into them, an operation consuming an hour, he exclaimed,\r\n“Why, my good sir, your pride should be in your legs, not your head!”\r\n\r\n“At present,” I said, “it certainly is.”\r\n\r\nThe six quadrilles were really the event of the ball, consisting of “The\r\nHobby-horse Quadrille,” the men who danced in it being dressed in\r\n“pink,” and the ladies wearing red hunting-coats and white satin skirts,\r\nall of the period of Louis XIV. In the “Mother Goose Quadrille” were\r\n“Jack and Jill,” “Little Red Riding-Hood,” “Bo-Peep,” “Goody Two-Shoes,”\r\n“Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary,” and “My Pretty Maid.” The “Opera Bouffe\r\nQuadrille” was most successful; but of all of them, “The Star\r\nQuadrille,” containing the youth and beauty of the city, was the most\r\nbrilliant. The ladies in it were arrayed as twin stars, in four\r\ndifferent colors, yellow, blue, mauve, and white. Above the forehead of\r\neach lady, in her hair, was worn an electric light, giving a fairy and\r\nelf-like appearance to each of them. “The Dresden Quadrille,” in which\r\nthe ladies wore white satin, with powdered hair, and the gentlemen white\r\nsatin knee breeches and powdered wigs, with the Dresden mark, crossed\r\nswords, on each of them, was effective. The hostess appeared as a\r\nVenetian Princess, with a superb jeweled peacock in her hair. The host\r\nwas the Duke de Guise for that evening. The host’s eldest brother wore a\r\ncostume of Louis XVI. His wife appeared as “The Electric Light,” in\r\nwhite satin, trimmed with diamonds, and her head one blaze of diamonds.\r\nThe most remarkable costume, and one spoken of to this day, was that of\r\na cat; the dress being of cats’ tails and white cats’ heads, and a bell\r\nwith “Puss” on it in large letters. A distinguished beauty, dressed as a\r\nPhœnix, adorned with diamonds and rubies, was superb, and the\r\nCapuchin Monk, with hood and sandals, inimitable; but to name the most\r\nstriking would be to name all.\r\n\r\nThe great social revolution that had occurred in New York this winter,\r\nlike most revolutionary waves, reached Newport. Our distinguished New\r\nYork journalist then made Newport his summer home, buying the fine\r\ngranite house that for years had been first known as “The Middleton\r\nMansion,” afterwards the “Sidney Brooks residence,” and filling it with\r\ndistinguished Europeans. His activity and energy gave new life to the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nOne fine summer morning, one of his guests, an officer in the English\r\narmy, a bright spirit and admirable horseman, riding on his polo pony up\r\nto the Newport Reading-room, where all the fossils of the place, the\r\nnobs, and the swells daily gossiped, he was challenged to ride the pony\r\ninto the hall of this revered old club, and being bantered to do it, he\r\nactually did ride the pony across the narrow piazza, and into the hall\r\nof the club itself. This was enough to set Newport agog. What sacrilege!\r\nan Englishman to ride in upon us, not respecting the sanctity of the\r\nplace! It aroused the old patriots, who were members of that\r\nInstitution, with the spirit of ’76, and a summary note was sent to the\r\ngreat journalist, withdrawing the invitation the club had previously\r\ngiven his guest. The latter, in turn, felt aggrieved, and retaliated\r\nwith this result: Building for Newport a superb Casino, embracing a\r\nclub, a ball-room, and a restaurant, opposite his own residence. All\r\nthis evidencing that agitation of any kind is as beneficial in social\r\ncircles, as to the atmosphere we breathe.\r\n\r\nThen our journalist conceived and gave a handsome domino ball. All the\r\nladies in domino, much after the pattern of the one previously given by\r\nthe Duchess de Dino, and in many respects resembling it, having a huge\r\ntent spread behind the house, and all the rooms on the first floor\r\nconverted into a series of charming supper-rooms, each table decorated\r\nmost elaborately with beautiful flowers; as handsome a ball as one\r\ncould give. I took the wife of the Attorney-General to it in domino,\r\nwho, after her life in Washington, was amazed at the beauty of the\r\nscene. The grounds, which were very handsome, were all, even the plants\r\nthemselves, illuminated with electric lights--that is, streams of\r\nelectric light were cunningly thrown under the plants, giving an\r\nillumination _à giorno_, and producing the most beautiful effect.\r\n\r\nAt this ball there appeared a Blue Domino that set all the men wild.\r\nComing to the ball in her own carriage (her servants she felt she could\r\ntrust not to betray her) she dashed into the merry throng, and gliding\r\nfrom one to the other whispered airy nothings into men’s ears. But they\r\ncontained enough to excite the most intense curiosity as to who she was.\r\nShe was the belle of the evening; she became bold and daring at times,\r\nattacking men of and about the inmost secrets of their hearts, so as to\r\nalarm them, and when she had worked them all up to a fever heat, she\r\ncame to me to take her to the door that she might make good her escape.\r\nA dozen men barricaded the way, but with the rapidity of a deer she\r\ndashed through them, reached the sidewalk, and her footman literally\r\nthrew her into the carriage. Her coachman, well drilled, dashed off at a\r\nfurious rate, and to this day no one has ever found out who the fair\r\ncreature was.\r\n\r\nThe next social event after this grand ball was a large breakfast the\r\ngreat journalist gave for the Duke of Beaufort, at Southwick’s Grove. We\r\nall sat at tables under the trees, and we had what the French so aptly\r\nterm a _déjeuner dinatoire_. At it the Duke was most eloquent in his\r\nwonderful description of a fishing exploit he had had that morning;\r\nrising at 2 A.M., and driving to “Black Rock,” he groped his way to the\r\nfarthest point, and had the satisfaction of hooking an enormous bass.\r\nIn his own words, “As I saw him on the crest of the wave, I knew I had\r\nhim, and then my sport began.”\r\n\r\nHearing that President Arthur would visit Newport, as I felt greatly in\r\nhis debt I resolved to do my share in making his visit pleasant and\r\nagreeable. He was to be the guest of Governor Morgan, whom I at once\r\nbuttonholed and to him gave the above views. I found, like all these\r\ngreat political magnates, that he preferred to have the President to\r\nhimself, and rather threw cold water on my attempting anything in my\r\nhumble way at entertaining him. “Why, my dear sir,” he replied, “the\r\nPresident will not go to one of your country picnics. It is preposterous\r\nto think of getting up such a rural thing for him. I shall, of course,\r\ndine him and give him a fête, and have already sent to New York for my\r\nMadeira.”\r\n\r\n“Sent for your Madeira!” I exclaimed. “Why, my dear Governor, it will\r\nnot be fit to drink when it reaches you.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Because it will be so shaken up, it will be like tasting bad drugs.\r\nMadeira of any age, if once moved, cannot be tasted until it has had at\r\nleast a month’s repose. President Arthur is a good judge of Madeira, and\r\nhe would not drink your wine.”\r\n\r\n“Well, what am I to do?” said he.\r\n\r\n“Why, my dear Governor, I will myself carry to your house for him a\r\ncouple of bottles of my very best Madeira.” This I did, sitting in the\r\nmiddle of the carriage, one bottle in each hand (it having been first\r\ncarefully decanted), and into the Governor’s parlor I was ushered, and\r\nthen placed my offering before the President, telling him that I well\r\nknew he loved women, as well as song and wine; prayed him to honor me\r\nwith his presence at a Newport picnic, promising to cull a bouquet of\r\nsuch exotics as are only grown in a Newport hothouse. The invitation he\r\nat once accepted, much, I thought, to the chagrin of the Governor, who,\r\naccompanying me to his front door, said:\r\n\r\n“My dear sir, one must remember that he is the President of the United\r\nStates, ruling over sixty millions of people. He is here as my guest,\r\nand now to go off and dine on Sunday with a leader of fashion, and then\r\nto follow this up by attending one of your open-air lunches, seems to me\r\nnot right.” (I must here say in his defense, that the Governor had never\r\nbeen to one of my “open-air lunches,” and knew not of what he spoke.)\r\n\r\nI then resolved to make this picnic worthy of our great ruler, and at\r\nonce invited to it a beautiful woman, one who might have been selected\r\nfor a Madonna. This is the first time I have made mention of her; she\r\npossessed that richness of nature you only see in Southern climes; one\r\nof the most beautiful women in America. She promised to go to this\r\ncountry party, and bring her court with her.\r\n\r\nI selected the loveliest spot on Newport Island, known as “The Balch\r\nPlace,” near “The Paradise and Purgatory Rocks,” for this fête. The\r\nAtlantic Ocean, calm and unruffled, lay before us; all the noise it made\r\nwas the gentle ripple of the waves as they kissed the rocky shore.\r\nGiving the President our great beauty, he led the way to the collation,\r\npartaken of at little tables under the sparse trees that the rough\r\nwinter barely permitted to live, and then we had a merry dance on the\r\ngreen, on an excellent platform fringed with plants.\r\n\r\nAt a subsequent breakfast, I was intensely gratified to have the\r\nPresident say to me, before the whole company, “McAllister, you did\r\nindeed redeem your promise. The beauty of the women at your picnic, the\r\nbeauty of the place, and its admirable arrangement--made it the\r\npleasantest party I have had at Newport,”--and this was said before my\r\nfriend the Governor. Grand, elaborate entertainments are ofttimes not as\r\nenjoyable as country frolics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON DINNERS AND NEW YORK BALLS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n     _I visit Washington as the guest of Attorney-General Brewster--A\r\n     Dinner at the White House--Amusing arrangement of Guests--The\r\n     Winthrop Statue--The memorable Winters of 1884-85--A Millionaire’s\r\n     House-warming--A London Ball in New York--A Modern Amy\r\n     Robsart--Transforming Delmonico’s entire place into a\r\n     Ball-room--The New Year’s Ball at the Metropolitan Opera\r\n     House--Last Words._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following winter my friend Attorney-General Brewster invited me to\r\nWashington to pass a fortnight with him, and I then got a glimpse of\r\nmodern life in that city. I enjoyed my visit, but found the people\r\nslower of action than we are in New York; for instance, it took my kind\r\nhost fully a week to consider over and map out a dinner for me. Then,\r\njust as I was leaving, the President asked me to dine with him. I was\r\ninformed that it was imperative that I should cancel other engagements\r\nand remain over to accept his invitation.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of the guests at this dinner was to me amusing. Reaching\r\nthe White House, I was separated from the ladies I brought, and could\r\nnot in any way find them again to enter the drawing-room with them, but\r\nwas ushered into it from a side door, and there joined the gentlemen,\r\nwho stood in line on one side of the room, while from an opposite door\r\nthe ladies entered the same room, and formed in line, as it were,\r\nopposite the men. When all were assembled, the President himself\r\nentered, bowed to his guests, and offered his arm to one of the ladies,\r\nand led the way in to dinner.\r\n\r\nThe view from the dining-room into the conservatories, displaying the\r\nfinest collection of white azaleas I have ever seen, was most effective.\r\nThe dinner was good, and well served; the President most gracious.\r\nTurning to me, he said, “Why, your friend Winthrop is not himself\r\nto-day. What is the matter with him?” I replied, “My dear Mr. President,\r\nhe has been up to the Capitol, and seen his ancestor in white marble,\r\nand found his nose was shockingly dirty. This annoyed and mortified\r\nhim.” The President replied, “Really, well, this is too bad! This matter\r\nshall at once have my attention. That nose shall be wiped to-morrow!”\r\n\r\nThe winters of 1884 and 1885 will long be remembered by New York society\r\npeople, for three of the largest, handsomest, and most successful balls\r\never given in this city have made them memorable. The heir to probably\r\nthe largest fortune ever left to one man in this country, then threw\r\nopen the doors of his palatial residence and generously invited all who\r\nwere in any way entitled to an invitation, to come and view his superb\r\nhouse, and join in the dance which was to inaugurate its completion.\r\n\r\nAs I went up the beautiful stairs and passed along the gallery, looking\r\ndown on a hall such as few palaces contain, with a long train of\r\nhandsomely dressed women passing me on their way down to the reception\r\nroom, it put me in mind of a scene I well remembered at the Hôtel de\r\nVille, in Paris, at a ball given by the Emperor Napoleon III. to the\r\nKing of Sardinia. It looked royal, and was most impressive. Our host\r\nstood in the centre of his hall, giving to all a warm welcome. Passing\r\nhim we entered his _grand salon_, where his wife received us. The room\r\nitself, Oriental, and as Eastern and luxurious in its own peculiar style\r\nas one could create it. From this _salon_, we entered a novel Japanese\r\nroom, and then the fine dining-room of the house, with its marvelous\r\nceiling, painted by one of the best modern French artists. The picture\r\ngalleries were the ball and supper rooms. The cotillion was danced in\r\nthe farthest of the two galleries, the ladies seated in double and\r\ntriple lines on improvised seats, as if they were sitting on a long\r\nextended dais all around the room. The effect was dazzling and\r\nbrilliant. All supped well, for when supper was announced little tables\r\nwere placed like magic through the rooms; and New Yorkers had what they\r\nwell knew how to appreciate--an elaborate, well-served repast; champagne\r\nin abundance, and of the best, and in perfect condition. In my opinion,\r\nit was one of the handsomest, most profuse, liberal, and brilliant balls\r\never given in this country.\r\n\r\nThe next great flutter in New York’s fashionable world was the\r\nannouncement of a grand entertainment to be given, embracing all the\r\nfeatures of a London ball, which, though a novelty here, had for years\r\nbeen done in London; that was to build an addition to one’s house, to be\r\nused but for one night, and to be made large enough to comfortably hold,\r\nwith the house, one thousand or twelve hundred people. There was plenty\r\nof energy and talent to carry this out, and reproduce here what\r\nLondoners have always been so proud of--their ability to double the\r\ncapacity of their city houses by utilizing their yards, covering them\r\nwith a temporary structure, to be used as a supper or ball room. A young\r\nman of an old Long Island family had married a beautiful girl, a young\r\nwoman such as Walter Scott would have taken to impersonate his character\r\nof Amy Robsart, who, besides this natural and _naïve_ style of beauty,\r\npossessed great administrative ability, and withal much taste, a great\r\namount of energy, and a fortune large enough to carry through any\r\nenterprise she conceived. Both of them were devoted to society, and to\r\neach other. Passing their summers abroad, and seeing what vast\r\nconceptions society there undertook, and successfully carried out, they\r\nresolved to repeat here what they had seen on the other side of the\r\nwater. In Marcotte they had a great ally, a man of wonderful taste and\r\nability; planning out the work themselves, with his skillful hand to\r\nexecute it, they certainly built up in a night, as it were, a superb\r\nbanqueting hall, complete and elaborately finished as if a part of the\r\nhouse itself; a solid structure, with no appearance of its being\r\ntemporary or run up for the occasion. Throwing two houses into one, and\r\ndescending from them into this vast banqueting hall by a wide flight of\r\nstairs, you had, to all appearances, a grand palatial residence, whose\r\nrooms the largest crowd could roam through with freedom and perfect\r\ncomfort. The houses themselves were so handsomely decorated in the\r\nperiod of Louis XIV., that it required cultivated taste to add floral\r\ndecorations to such rooms; but it was done, and admirably done, and was\r\na remarkable feature of this superb ball. Garlands of the delicate _La\r\nFrance_ roses were festooned on the walls, and over and around the doors\r\nand windows, producing a charming effect. There were two cotillions\r\ndanced in separate rooms. The approach from the street to the houses was\r\nadmirable; the pavement was inclosed the entire length of both,\r\ncarpeted, and brilliantly lighted with innumerable jets of gas--a ball\r\nlong to be remembered!\r\n\r\nWhat then was there left for one to do in the way of entertaining to\r\ngive society anything new and novel? This duty was then imposed on me.\r\nThese pages bear evidence that I am blessed with memory, but imagination\r\nwas then what I required to conceive and carry out some new enterprise\r\nin the way of a subscription New Year’s ball, to surpass anything I had\r\never before given.\r\n\r\nThe most difficult rooms to decorate are those at Delmonico’s; but this\r\nestablishment is unequaled in London or Paris in that it gives under its\r\nroof incomparable balls, banquets, and dinners. So we resolved that\r\ntalent, taste, and money should be expended in an effort to design and\r\ngive there a superb ball. The house had the advantage of having a large\r\nsquare room, all that was required for a dance of three to four hundred\r\npeople. On this occasion we were to have seven hundred, and for so\r\nlarge a number we had to provide two _salles de danse_. The upper supper\r\nroom we turned into a conservatory. Its ceilings were low, but covering\r\nthem with creeping plants, making around the entire room a dado of banks\r\nof flowers and the walls themselves decorated with plaques of roses,\r\nintroducing the electric light and throwing its jets through all the\r\nfoliage, we had an improvised bower of flowers and plants that tempted\r\nall to wander through, if not to linger in it in admiration of the\r\nartistic skill which produced such a result. One room we converted, with\r\nVantine’s assistance, into a perfect Japanese interior. Once in it, we\r\nfelt transported to that country. Here were served tea and Japanese\r\nconfections, and over all shone the electric light with charming effect.\r\nThe _salon_ known as the Red Room had its walls decorated with sheaves\r\nof wheat, in which nestled bunches of _Marechale Neil_ roses, the\r\nbackground of scarlet bringing these decorations out strikingly. This,\r\nwith a new floor, was converted into a _salle de danse_. The large hall\r\ninto which all these rooms opened was superb, for on all sides of it,\r\nfrom floor to ceiling, were hung the finest Gobelin tapestries of\r\nfabulous value. To obtain their use we had to telegraph to Paris, and\r\nwere required to insure them for a large sum. Servants in light plush\r\nlivery, pumps, and silk stockings, with powdered hair, stood on either\r\nside to direct the guests. Having the whole house, we supped in both\r\nrestaurant and café, and as we had given an unlimited order had an\r\nelaborate and exquisite supper.\r\n\r\nFor a small ball of seven hundred people, I have always felt, and still\r\nfeel, that this New Year’s Ball, as given at Delmonico’s, was in every\r\nsense of the word the handsomest, most complete, and most successful\r\nthing of the kind that I have ever attempted in New York City, and I\r\nfind I am not alone in this opinion. It was as much a feast for the eye\r\nas the elaborate supper was for the palate, being complete in every\r\ndetail, luxurious in adornment, as to its rooms--and epicurean in its\r\nfeasting.\r\n\r\nNew York society had now become so large that it seemed necessary to\r\nsolve at once what, to us, has long been a problem, i.e. where we could\r\nbring general society together in one large dancing-room; for though you\r\nmay have a dozen rooms thrown open, you will always find that all rush\r\nto the room where there is dancing. Where then could we get a room where\r\nall could at one and the same time be on the floor? It occurred to me\r\nthat the Metropolitan Opera House had, in its stage and auditorium, such\r\na room, and if we could only divest it of its characteristics, it would\r\nbe what we wanted.\r\n\r\nSatisfying ourselves that we could accomplish this, we formed a\r\nCommittee of Three and entered on this new enterprise. Artists, who have\r\nwith ability painted small pictures, may venture on larger canvas. We\r\nhad succeeded in giving balls of seven hundred and four hundred people.\r\nWhy not have a similar success on a larger scale? Had our ideas been\r\nproperly carried out, this ball would have been twice the success it\r\nwas. The defects were evident, but when seen it was too late to remedy\r\nthem. The artificial ceiling, cleverly planned to shut out the\r\ngalleries, was not completed, the electric lights were not shaded as\r\nthey should have been, and the music stands, ordered by the authorities\r\nto be elevated, were unsightly, and marred the brilliant effect we had\r\nstudied to produce. All else received more praise than criticism.\r\n\r\nThe four most striking points of this ball were, first, the reception of\r\nover twelve hundred people as at a private house by three of our most\r\nbrilliant and accomplished society ladies; again, what may be termed the\r\n_Quadrille d’Honneur_ of that ball, which was the different sets of the\r\nSir Roger de Coverly, danced by the most distinguished ladies of this\r\ncity, the “nobs” and the “swells” on this occasion uniting; the supping\r\nof over twelve hundred people at one time at small tables, and the\r\ncotillion ably led by one of our distinguished State Senators, a man in\r\nhimself representing family, wealth, and political position.\r\n\r\nThe Sir Roger de Coverly was danced in the auditorium and on the stage,\r\nand before its completion a blast from the _cornet à piston_ was sounded\r\nby direction of the Management, when at once the three members of the\r\nExecutive Committee sought the three lady patronesses who had so\r\ngraciously received for them the guests of this large ball, and had the\r\nhonor of taking them in to supper. A special table in the centre of the\r\nsupper room, elaborately decorated with flowers, was arranged for them,\r\nand the handsome and courteous gentleman who so royally dispenses\r\nhospitality both at his house in town and at his ocean villa in Newport\r\n(the handsomest country residence in the United States), at once sought\r\none of America’s loveliest, most beautiful, and most graceful daughters,\r\na charming representative of an old Colonial family, and doubly a New\r\nYorker, representing the historic families of Livingston and Ludlow.\r\nAnother member of the Committee, a descendant of one of our oldest\r\nfamilies, whose ancestor was a distinguished General in the Revolution,\r\nhad the fortune to have on his arm a most superbly dressed woman, whose\r\ntiara of diamonds could well have graced a Queen’s brow--whose beauty I\r\nhave before alluded to when comparing her to Amy Robsart. I had the\r\nhonor of leading the way with our leader of society, whom Worth had\r\nadorned with a robe of such magnificence that it attracted and held the\r\nattention of the whole assembly. Her jewels were resplendent--in\r\nthemselves a King’s ransom; and placing her on my right, at the supper\r\ntable, I had on my left the beautiful woman who had won the hearts of\r\nthe American nation.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this ball, I must mete out due praise to the man who\r\ncould so successfully care for so large a number of people at supper at\r\none time, and give credit to the good and effective work done by the\r\nthree hundred well-trained, liveried servants scattered through the\r\nhouse, understanding their work and performing it admirably. This ball\r\nwas given as a New Year’s Ball on the 2d of January, 1890.\r\n\r\nAnd now, in concluding this book, I beg to say that I have simply\r\ndiscussed society as I have found it, and only such entertainments of\r\nwhich I have been part and parcel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRESENT FASHION IN STATIONERY.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _In America the residence is always in the right\r\ncorner._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _In England, if any residence is engraved on a card, it\r\nis in the left corner._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _In France, no lady’s residence is now put on a card._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: P.
