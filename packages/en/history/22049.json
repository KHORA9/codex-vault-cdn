Jusserand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLondon\r\nT. Fisher Unwin\r\nMdcccccv\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nMany histories have preceded this one; many others will come after. Such\r\nis the charm of the subject that volunteers will never be lacking to\r\nundertake this journey, so hard, so delightful too.\r\n\r\nAs years go on, the journey lengthens: wider grows the field, further\r\nadvance the seekers, and from the top of unexplored headlands, through\r\nmorning mists, they descry the outlines of countries till then unknown.\r\nThey must be followed to realms beyond the grave, to the silent domains\r\nof the dead, across barren moors and frozen fens, among chill rushes and\r\nbriars that never blossom, till those Edens of poetry are reached, the\r\nechoes of which, by a gift of fairies or of muses, still vibrate to the\r\nmelody of voices long since hushed.\r\n\r\nMore has been done during the last fifty years to shed light on the\r\norigins than in all the rest of modern times. Deciphering, annotating,\r\nprinting, have gone on at an extraordinary pace and without\r\ninterruption; the empire of letters has thus been enlarged, according to\r\nthe chances of the explorers' discoveries, by gardens and deserts,\r\ncloudy immensities, and boundless forests; its limits have receded into\r\nspace: at least so it seems to us. We laugh at the simplicity of honest\r\nRobertson, who in the last century wondered at the superabundance of\r\nhistorical documents accessible in his time: the day is not far distant\r\nwhen we shall be laughed at in the same way for our own simplicity.\r\n\r\nThe field of literary history widens in another manner yet, and one that\r\naffects us more nearly. The years glide on so rapidly that the traveller\r\nwho started to explore the lands of former times, absorbed by his task,\r\noblivious of days and months, is surprised on his return at beholding\r\nhow the domain of the past has widened. To the past belongs Tennyson,\r\nthe laureate; to the past belongs Browning, and that ruddy smiling face,\r\nmanly and kind, which the traveller to realms beyond intended to\r\ndescribe from nature on his coming back among living men, has faded\r\naway, and the grey slab of Westminster covers it. A thing of the past,\r\ntoo, the master who first in France taught the way, daring in his\r\nresearches, straightforward in his judgments, unmindful of consequences,\r\nmindful of Truth alone; whose life was a model no less than his work.\r\nThe work subsists, but who shall tell what the life has been, and what\r\nthere was beneficent in that patriarchal voice with its clear, soft, and\r\ndignified tones? The life of Taine is a work which his other works have\r\nnot sufficiently made known.\r\n\r\nThe task is an immense one; its charm can scarcely be expressed. No one\r\ncan understand, who has not been there himself, the delight found in\r\nthose far-off retreats, sanctuaries beyond the reach of worldly\r\ntroubles. In the case of English literature the delight is the greater\r\nfrom the fact that those silent realms are not the realms of death\r\nabsolute; daylight is perceived in the distance; the continuity of life\r\nis felt. The dead of Westminster have left behind them a posterity,\r\nyouthful in its turn, and life-giving. Their descendants move around us;\r\nunder our eyes the inheritors of what has been prepare what shall be. In\r\nthis lies one of the great attractions of this literature and of the\r\nFrench one too. Like the French it has remote origins; it is ample,\r\nbeautiful, measureless; no one will go the round of it; it is impossible\r\nto write its complete history. An attempt has been made in this line for\r\nFrench literature; the work undertaken two centuries ago by\r\nBenedictines, continued by members of the Institute, is still in\r\nprogress; it consists at this day of thirty volumes in quarto, and only\r\nthe year 1317 has been reached. And with all that immense past and those\r\nfar-distant origins, those two literatures have a splendid present\r\nbetokening a splendid future. Both are alive to-day and vigorous; ready\r\nto baffle the predictions of miscreants, they show no sign of decay.\r\nThey are ever ready for transformations, not for death. Side by side or\r\nface to face, in peace or war, both literatures like both peoples have\r\nbeen in touch for centuries, and in spite of hates and jealousies they\r\nhave more than once vivified each other. These actions and reactions\r\nbegan long ago, in Norman times and even before; when Taillefer sang\r\nRoland, and when Alcuin taught Charlemagne.\r\n\r\nThe duty of the traveller visiting already visited countries is to not\r\nlimit himself to general descriptions, but to make with particular care\r\nthe kind of observations for which circumstances have fitted him best.\r\nIf he has the eye of the painter, he will trace and colour with\r\nunfailing accuracy hues and outlines; if he has the mind of the\r\nscientist, he will study the formation of the ground and classify the\r\nflora and fauna. If he has no other advantage but the fact that\r\ncircumstances have caused him to live in the country, at various times,\r\nfor a number of years, in contact with the people, in calm days and\r\nstormy days, he will perhaps make himself useful, if, while diminishing\r\nsomewhat in his book the part usually allowed to technicalities and\r\naesthetic problems, he increases the part allotted to the people and to\r\nthe nation: a most difficult task assuredly; but, whatever be his too\r\nlegitimate apprehensions, he must attempt it, having no other chance,\r\nwhen so much has been done already, to be of any use. The work in such a\r\ncase will not be, properly speaking, a \"History of English Literature,\"\r\nbut rather a \"Literary History of the English People.\"\r\n\r\nNot only will the part allotted to the nation itself be greater in such\r\na book than habitually happens, but several manifestations of its\r\ngenius, generally passed over in silence, will have to be studied. The\r\nages during which the national thought expressed itself in languages\r\nwhich were not the national one, will not be allowed to remain blank, as\r\nif, for complete periods, the inhabitants of the island had ceased to\r\nthink at all. The growing into shape of the people's genius will have to\r\nbe studied with particular attention. The Chapter House of Westminster\r\nwill be entered, and there will be seen how the nation, such as it was\r\nthen represented, became conscious, even under the Plantagenets, of its\r\nexistence, rights and power. Philosophers and reformers must be\r\nquestioned concerning the theories which they spread: and not without\r\nsome purely literary advantage. Bacon, Hobbes, and Locke are the\r\nancestors of many poets who have never read their works, but who have\r\nbreathed an air impregnated with their thought. Dreamers will be\r\nfollowed, singers, tale-tellers, and preachers, wherever it pleases them\r\nto lead us: to the Walhalla of the north, to the green dales of Erin,\r\nto the Saxon church of Bradford-on-Avon, to Blackheath, to the \"Tabard\"\r\nand the \"Mermaid,\" to the \"Globe,\" to \"Will's\" coffee house, among\r\nruined fortresses, to cloud-reaching steeples, or along the furrow sown\r\nto good intent by Piers the honest Plowman.\r\n\r\nThe work, the first part of which is now published, is meant to be\r\ndivided into three volumes; but as \"surface as small as possible must be\r\noffered to the shafts of Fortune,\" each volume will make a complete\r\nwhole in itself, the first telling the literary story of the English up\r\nto the Renaissance, the second up to the accession of King Pope, the\r\nlast up to our own day. The present version has been prepared with the\r\nhelp of M. E. R., who have once more lent me their most kind and\r\nvaluable assistance. I beg them to accept the expression of my heartfelt\r\ngratitude.\r\n\r\nNo attempt has been made to say everything and be complete. Many notes\r\nwill however allow the curious to go themselves to the sources, to\r\nverify, to see with their own eyes, and, if they find cause (_absit\r\nomen!_), to disagree. In those notes most of the space has been filled\r\nby references to originals; little has been left for works containing\r\ncriticisms and appreciations: the want of room is the only reason, not\r\nthe want of reverence and sympathy for predecessors.\r\n\r\nTo be easily understood one must be clear, and, to be clear,\r\nqualifications and attenuations must be reduced to a minimum. The reader\r\nwill surely understand that many more \"perhapses\" and \"abouts\" were in\r\nthe mind of the author than will be found in print; he will make, in his\r\nbenevolence, due allowance for the roughness of that instrument, speech,\r\napplied to events, ideas, theories, things of beauty, as difficult to\r\nmeasure with rule as \"the myst on Malverne hulles.\" He will know that\r\nwhen Saxons are described as having a sad, solemn genius, and not\r\nnumbering among their pre-eminent qualities the gift of repartee, it\r\ndoes not mean that for six centuries they all of them sat and wept\r\nwithout intermission, and that when asked a question they never knew\r\nwhat to answer. All men are men, and have human qualities more or less\r\ndeveloped in their minds; nothing more is implied in those passages but\r\nthat one quality was _more_ developed in one particular race of men and\r\nthat in another.\r\n\r\nWhen a book is just finished, there is always for the author a most\r\ndoleful hour, when, retracing his steps, he thinks of what he has\r\nattempted, the difficulties of the task, the unlikeliness that he has\r\novercome them. Misprints taking wrong numbers by the hand, black and\r\nthorny creatures, dance their wild dance round him. He is awe-stricken,\r\nand shudders; he wonders at the boldness of his undertaking;\r\n\"Qu'allait-il faire dans cette galere?\" The immensity of the task, the\r\ninsufficience of the means stand in striking contrast. He had started\r\nsinging on his journey; now he looks for excuses to justify his having\r\never begun it. Usually, it must be confessed, he finds some, prints them\r\nor not, and recovers his spirits. I have published other works; I think\r\nI did not print the excuses I found to explain the whys and the\r\nwherefores; they were the same in all cases: roadway stragglers, Piers\r\nPlowman, Count Cominges, Tudor novelists, were in a large measure\r\nleft-off subjects. No books had been dedicated to them; the attempt,\r\ntherefore, could not be considered as an undue intrusion. But in the\r\npresent case, what can be said, what excuse can be found, when so many\r\nhave written, and so well too?\r\n\r\nThe author of this book once had a drive in London; when it was\r\nfinished, he offered the cabman his fare. Cabman glanced at it; it did\r\nnot look much in his large, hollow hand; he said: \"I want sixpence\r\nmore.\" Author said: \"Why? It is the proper fare; I know the distance\r\nvery well; give me a reason.\" Cabman mused for a second, and said: \"I\r\nshould like it so!\"\r\n\r\nI might perhaps allege a variety of reasons, but the true one is the\r\nsame as the cabman's. I did this because I could not help it; I loved it\r\nso.\r\n\r\nJ.\r\n\r\n_All Souls Day, 1894._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Preface                                                              1\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I.\r\n\r\n_THE ORIGINS._\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nBRITANNIA.\r\n\r\n  I.

In both countries the same\r\nraces met and mingled at about the same period, but in different\r\nproportions and under dissimilar social conditions. Hence the striking\r\nresemblances and sharply defined contrasts that exist in the genius of\r\nthe two nations. Hence also the contradictory sentiments which mutually\r\nanimated them from century to century, those combinations and\r\nrecurrences of esteem that rose to admiration, and jealousy that swelled\r\nto hate. Hence, again, the unparalleled degree of interest they offer,\r\none for the other. The two people are so dissimilar that in borrowing\r\nfrom each other they run no risk of losing their national\r\ncharacteristics and becoming another's image; and yet, so much alike are\r\nthey, it is impossible that what they borrowed should remain barren and\r\nunproductive. These loans act like leaven: the products of English\r\nthought during the Augustan age of British literature were mixed with\r\nFrench leaven, and the products of French thought during the Victor Hugo\r\nperiod were penetrated with English yeast.\r\n\r\nAncient writers have left us little information concerning the remotest\r\nperiod and the oldest inhabitants of the British archipelago; works\r\nwhich would be invaluable to us exist only in meagre fragments.\r\nImportant gaps have fortunately been filled, owing to modern Science and\r\nto her manifold researches. She has inherited the wand of the departed\r\nwizards, and has touched with her talisman the gate of sepulchres; the\r\ntombs have opened and the dead have spoken. What countries did thy\r\nwar-ship visit? she inquired of the Scandinavian viking. And in answer\r\nthe dead man, asleep for centuries among the rocks of the Isle of Skye,\r\nshowed golden coins of the caliphs in his skeleton hand. These coins are\r\nnot a figure of speech; they are real, and may be seen at the Edinburgh\r\nMuseum. The wand has touched old undeciphered manuscripts, and broken\r\nthe charm that kept them dumb. From them rose songs, music,\r\nlove-ditties, and war-cries: phrases so full of life that the living\r\nhearts of to-day have been stirred by them; words with so much colour in\r\nthem that the landscape familiar to the eyes of the Celts and Germans\r\nhas reappeared before us.\r\n\r\nMuch remains undiscovered, and the dead hold secrets they may yet\r\nreveal. In the unexplored tombs of the Nile valley will be found one\r\nday, among the papyri stripped from Ptolemaic mummies, the account of a\r\njourney made to the British Isles about 330 B.C., by a Greek of\r\nMarseilles named Pytheas, a contemporary of Aristotle and Alexander the\r\nGreat, of which a few sentences only have been preserved.[1] But even\r\nnow the darkness which enveloped the origin has been partly cleared\r\naway.\r\n\r\nTo the primitive population, the least known of all, that reared the\r\nstones of Carnac in France, and in England the gigantic circles of\r\nStonehenge and Avebury, succeeded in both countries, many centuries\r\nbefore Christ, the Celtic race.\r\n\r\nThe Celts ([Greek: keltai]) were thus called by the Greeks from the name\r\nof one of their principal tribes, in the same way as the French,\r\nEnglish, Scottish, and German nations derive theirs from that of one of\r\ntheir principal tribes. They occupied, in the third century before our\r\nera, the greater part of Central Europe, of the France of to-day, of\r\nSpain, and of the British Isles. They were neighbours of the Greeks and\r\nLatins; the centre of their possessions was in Bavaria. From there, and\r\nnot from Gaul, set out the expeditions by which Rome was taken, Delphi\r\nplundered, and a Phrygian province rebaptized Galatia. Celtic cemeteries\r\nabound throughout that region; the most remarkable of them was\r\ndiscovered, not in France, but at Hallstadt, near Salzburg, in\r\nAustria.[2]\r\n\r\nThe language of the Celts was much nearer the Latin tongue than the\r\nGermanic idioms; it comprised several dialects, and amongst them the\r\nGaulish, long spoken in Gaul, the Gaelic, the Welsh, and the Irish,\r\nstill used in Scotland, Wales, and Ireland. The most important of the\r\nCeltic tribes, settled in the main island beyond the Channel, gave\r\nitself the name of Britons. Hence the name of Britain borne by the\r\ncountry, and indirectly that also of Great Britain, now the official\r\nappellation of England. The Britons appear to have emigrated from Gaul\r\nand established themselves among the other Celtic tribes already settled\r\nin the island, about the third century before Christ.\r\n\r\nDuring several hundred years, from the time of Pytheas to that of the\r\nRoman conquerors, the Mediterranean world remained ignorant of what took\r\nplace among insular Britons, and we are scarcely better informed than\r\nthey were. The centre of human civilisation had been moved from country\r\nto country round the great inland sea, having now reached Rome, without\r\nanything being known save that north of Gaul existed a vast country,\r\nsurrounded by water, rich in tin mines, covered by forests, prairies,\r\nand morasses, from which dense mists arose.\r\n\r\nThree centuries elapse; the Romans are settled in Gaul. Caesar, at the\r\nhead of his legions, has avenged the city for the insults of the Celtic\r\ninvaders, but the strife still continues; Vercingetorix has not yet\r\nappeared. Actuated by that sense of kinship so deeply rooted in the\r\nCelts, the effects of which are still to be seen from one shore of the\r\nAtlantic to the other, the Britons had joined forces with their\r\ncompatriots of the Continent against the Roman. Caesar resolved to lead\r\nhis troops to the other side of the Channel, but he knew nothing of the\r\ncountry, and wished first to obtain information. He questioned the\r\ntraders; they told him little, being, as they said, acquainted only with\r\nthe coasts, and that slightly. Caesar embarked in the night of August\r\n24th-25th, the year 55 before our era; it took him somewhat more time to\r\ncross the strait than is now needed to go from Paris to London. His\r\nexpedition was a real voyage of discovery; and he was careful, during\r\nhis two sojourns in the island, to examine as many people as possible,\r\nand note all he could observe concerning the customs of the natives. The\r\npicture he draws of the former inhabitants of England strikes us to-day\r\nas very strange. \"The greater part of the people of the interior,\" he\r\nwrites, \"do not sow; they live on milk and flesh, and clothe themselves\r\nin skins. All Britons stain themselves dark blue with woad, which gives\r\nthem a terrible aspect in battle. They wear their hair long, and shave\r\nall their body except their hair and moustaches.\"\r\n\r\nDid we forget the original is in Latin, we might think the passage was\r\nextracted from the travels of Captain Cook; and this is so true that, in\r\nthe account of his first journey around the world, the great navigator,\r\non arriving at the island of Savu, notices the similitude himself.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of a few details, the Celtic tribes of future England\r\nwere similar to those of future France.[3] Brave like them, with an\r\nundisciplined impetuosity that often brought them to grief (the\r\nimpetuosity of Poictiers and Nicopolis), curious, quick-tempered, prompt\r\nto quarrel, they fought after the same fashion as the Gauls, with the\r\nsame arms; and in the Witham and Thames have been found bronze shields\r\nsimilar in shape and carving to those graven on the triumphal arch at\r\nOrange, the image of which has now recalled for eighteen centuries Roman\r\ntriumph and Celtic defeat. Horace's saying concerning the Gaulish\r\nancestors applies equally well to Britons: never \"feared they\r\nfunerals.\"[4] The grave was for them without terrors; their faith in the\r\nimmortality of the soul absolute; death for them was not the goal, but\r\nthe link between two existences; the new life was as complete and\r\ndesirable as the old, and bore no likeness to that subterranean\r\nexistence, believed in by the ancients, partly localised in the\r\nsepulchre, with nothing sweeter in it than those sad things, rest and\r\noblivion. According to Celtic belief, the dead lived again under the\r\nlight of heaven; they did not descend, as they did with the Latins, to\r\nthe land of shades. No Briton, Gaul, or Irish could have understood the\r\nmelancholy words of Achilles: \"Seek not, glorious Ulysses, to comfort me\r\nfor death; rather would I till the ground for wages on some poor man's\r\nsmall estate than reign over all the dead.\"[5] The race was an\r\noptimistic one. It made the best of life, and even of death.\r\n\r\nThese beliefs were carefully fostered by the druids, priests and\r\nphilosophers, whose part has been the same in Gaul, Ireland, and\r\nBritain. Their teaching was a cause of surprise and admiration to the\r\nLatins. \"And you, druids,\" exclaims Lucan, \"dwelling afar under the\r\nbroad trees of the sacred groves, according to you, the departed visit\r\nnot the silent Erebus, nor the dark realm of pallid Pluto; the same\r\nspirit animates a body in a different world. Death, if what you say is\r\ntrue, is but the middle of a long life. Happy the error of those that\r\nlive under Arcturus; the worst of fears is to them unknown--the fear of\r\ndeath!\"[6]\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Britain possessed, again in common with those of\r\nGaul, a singular aptitude to understand and learn quickly. A short time\r\nafter the Roman Conquest it becomes hard to distinguish Celtic from\r\nRoman workmanship among the objects discovered in tombs. Caesar is\r\nastonished to see how his adversaries improve under his eyes. They were\r\nsimple enough at first; now they understand and foresee, and baffle his\r\nmilitary stratagems. To this intelligence and curiosity is due, with all\r\nits advantages and drawbacks, the faculty of assimilation possessed by\r\nthis race, and manifested to the same extent by no other in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Latin authors also admired another characteristic gift in the men of\r\nthis race: a readiness of speech, an eloquence, a promptness of repartee\r\nthat distinguished them from their Germanic neighbours. The people of\r\nGaul, said Cato, have two passions: to fight well and talk cleverly\r\n(_argute loqui_).[7] This is memorable evidence, since it reveals to us\r\na quality of a literary order: we can easily verify its truth, for we\r\nknow now in what kind of compositions, and with what talent the men of\r\nCeltic blood exercised their gift of speech.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nThat the Celtic tribes on both sides of the Channel closely resembled\r\neach other in manners, tastes, language, and turn of mind cannot be\r\ndoubted. \"Their language differs little,\" says Tacitus; \"their buildings\r\nare almost similar,\"[8] says Caesar. The similitude of their literary\r\ngenius is equally certain, for Cato's saying relates to continental\r\nCelts and can be checked by means of Irish poems and tales. Welsh\r\nstories of a later date afford us evidence fully as conclusive. If we\r\nchange the epoch, the result will be the same; the main elements of the\r\nCeltic genius have undergone no modification; Armoricans, Britons,\r\nWelsh, Irish, and Scotch, are all inexhaustible tale-tellers, skilful in\r\ndialogue, prompt at repartee, and never to be taken unawares. Gerald de\r\nBarry, the Welshman, gives us a description of his countrymen in the\r\ntwelfth century, which seems a paraphrase of what Cato had said of the\r\nGaulish Celts fourteen hundred years before.[9]\r\n\r\nIreland has preserved for us the most ancient monuments of Celtic\r\nthought. Nothing has reached us of those \"quantities of verses\" that,\r\naccording to Caesar, the druids taught their pupils in Gaul, with the\r\ncommand that they should never be written.[10] Only too well was the\r\ninjunction obeyed. Nothing, again, has been transmitted to us of the\r\nimprovisations of the Gallic or British bards ([Greek: bardoi]), whose\r\nfame was known to, and mentioned by, the ancients. In Ireland, however,\r\nCeltic literature had a longer period of development. The country was\r\nnot affected by the Roman Conquest; the barbarian invasions did not\r\nbring about the total ruin they caused in England and on the Continent.\r\nThe clerks of Ireland in the seventh and eighth centuries committed to\r\nwriting the ancient epic tales of their land. Notwithstanding the advent\r\nof Christianity, the pagan origins constantly reappear in these\r\nnarratives, and we are thus taken back to the epoch when they were\r\nprimarily composed, and even to the time when the events related are\r\nsupposed to have occurred. That time is precisely the epoch of Caesar and\r\nof the Christian era. Important works have, in our day, thrown a light\r\non this literature[11]; but all is not yet accomplished, and it has been\r\ncomputed that the entire publication of the ancient Irish manuscripts\r\nwould fill about a thousand octavo volumes. It cannot be said that the\r\npeople who produced these works were men of scanty speech; and here\r\nagain we recognise the immoderate love of tales and the insatiable\r\ncuriosity that Caesar had noticed in the Celts of the Continent.[12]\r\n\r\nMost of those Irish stories are part of the epic cycle of Conchobar and\r\nCuchulainn, and concern the wars of Ulster and Connaught. They are in\r\nprose, interspersed with verse. Long before being written, they existed\r\nin the shape of well-established texts, repeated word for word by men\r\nwhose avocation it was to know and remember, and who spent their lives\r\nin exercising their memory. The corporation of the _File_, or seers, was\r\ndivided into ten classes, from the _Oblar_, who knew only seven stories,\r\nto the _Ollam_, who knew three hundred and fifty.[13] Unlike the bards,\r\nthe File never invented, they remembered; they were obliged to know, not\r\nany stories whatsoever, but certain particular tales; lists of them have\r\nbeen found, and not a few of the stories entered in these catalogues\r\nhave come down to us.\r\n\r\nIf we look through the collections that have been made of them, we can\r\nsee that the Celtic authors of that period are already remarkable for\r\nqualities that have since shone with extreme brilliancy among various\r\nnations belonging to the same race: the sense of form and beauty, the\r\ndramatic gift, fertility of invention.[14] This is all the more\r\nnoticeable as the epoch was a barbarous one, and a multitude of passages\r\nrecall the wild savageness of the people. We find in these legends as\r\nmany scenes of slaughter and ferocious deeds as in the oldest Germanic\r\npoems: _Provincia ferox_, said Tacitus of Britain. The time is still\r\ndistant when woman shall become a deity; the murder of a man is\r\ncompensated by twenty-one head of cattle, and the murder of a woman by\r\nthree head only.[15] The warlike valour of the heroes is carried as far\r\nas human nature and imagination allow; not even Roland or Ragnar Lodbrok\r\ndie more heroically than Cuchulainn, who, mortally wounded, dies\r\nstanding:\r\n\r\n\"He fixed his eye on this hostile group. Then he leaned himself against\r\nthe high stone in the plain, and, by means of his belt, he fastened his\r\nbody to the high stone. Neither sitting nor lying would he die; but he\r\nwould die standing. Then his enemies gathered round him. They remained\r\nabout him, not daring to approach; he seemed to be still alive.\"[16]\r\n\r\nAt the same time, things of beauty have their place in these tales.\r\nThere are birds and flowers; women are described with loving admiration;\r\ntheir cheeks are purple \"as the fox-glove,\" their locks wave in the\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nAbove all, such a dramatic gift is displayed as to stand unparalleled in\r\nany European literature at its dawn.[17] Celtic poets excel in the art\r\nof giving a lifelike representation of deeds and events, of graduating\r\ntheir effects, and making their characters talk; they are matchless for\r\nspeeches and quick repartees. Compositions have come down to us that are\r\nall cut out into dialogues, so that the narrative becomes a drama. In\r\nsuch tales as the \"Murder of the Sons of Usnech,\" or \"Cuchulainn's\r\nSickness,\" in which love finds a place, these remarkable traits are to\r\nbe seen at their best. The story of \"Mac Datho's Pig\" is as powerfully\r\ndramatic and savage as the most cruel Germanic or Scandinavian songs;\r\nbut it is at the same time infinitely more varied in tone and artistic\r\nin shape. Pictures of everyday life, familiar fireside discussions\r\nabound, together with the scenes of blood loved by all nations in the\r\nseason of their early manhood.\r\n\r\n\"There was,\" we read, \"a famous king of Leinster, called Mac Datho. This\r\nking owned a dog, Ailbe by name, who defended the whole province and\r\nfilled Erin with his fame.\"[18] Ailill, king of Connaught, and\r\nConchobar, king of Ulster, claim the dog; and Mac Datho, much\r\nperplexed, consults his wife, who suggests that he should promise Ailbe\r\nto both. On the appointed day, the warriors of the two countries come to\r\nfetch the dog of renown, and a grand banquet is served them by Mac\r\nDatho, the principal dish of which is a rare kind of pig--\"three hundred\r\ncows had fed him for seven years.\" Scarcely are the guests seated, when\r\nthe dialogues begin:\r\n\r\n\"That pig looks good,\" says Conchobar.\r\n\r\n\"Truly, yes,\" replies Ailill; \"but, Conchobar, how shall he be carved?\"\r\n\r\n\"What more simple in this hall, where sit the glorious heroes of Erin?\"\r\ncried, from his couch, Bricriu, son of Carbad. \"To each his share,\r\naccording to his fights and deeds. But ere the shares are distributed,\r\nmore than one rap on the nose will have been given and received.\"\r\n\r\n\"So be it,\" said Ailill.\r\n\r\n\"'Tis fair,\" said Conchobar. \"We have with us the warriors who defended\r\nour frontiers.\"\r\n\r\nThen each one rises in turn and claims the honour of carving: I did\r\nthis.--I did still more.--I slew thy father.--I slew thy eldest son.--I\r\ngave thee that wound that still aches.\r\n\r\nThe warrior Cet had just told his awful exploits when Conall of Ulster\r\nrises against him and says:\r\n\r\n\"Since the day I first bore a spear, not often have I lacked the head of\r\na man of Connaught to pillow mine upon. Not a single day or night has\r\npassed in which I slew not an enemy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I confess it,\" said Cet, \"thou art a greater warrior than I; but were\r\nAnluan in this castle, he at least could compete with thee; 'tis a pity\r\nhe is not present.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is here!\" cried Conall, and drawing from his belt Anluan's head, he\r\nflung it on the table.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Murder of the Sons of Usnech,\"[19] woman plays the principal\r\npart. The mainspring of the story is love, and by it the heroes are led\r\nto death, a thing not to be found elsewhere in the European literature\r\nof the period. Still, those same heroes are not slight, fragile\r\ndreamers; if we set aside their love, and only consider their ferocity,\r\nthey are worthy of the Walhalla of Woden. By the following example we\r\nmay see how the insular Celts could love and die.\r\n\r\nThe child of Fedelmid's wife utters a cry in its mother's womb. They\r\nquestion Cathba the chief druid, who answers: \"That which has clamoured\r\nwithin thee is a fair-haired daughter, with fair locks, a majestic\r\nglance, blue eyes, and cheeks purple as the fox-glove\"; and he foretells\r\nthe woes she will cause among men. This girl is Derdriu; she is brought\r\nup secretly and apart, in order to evade the prediction. One day, \"she\r\nbeheld a raven drink blood on the snow.\" She said to Leborcham:\r\n\r\n\"The only man I could love would be one who united those three colours:\r\nhair as black as the raven, cheeks red as blood, body as white as snow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thou art lucky,\" answered Leborcham, \"the man thou desirest is not far\r\nto seek, he is near thee, in this very castle; it is Noise, son of\r\nUsnech.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall not be happy,\" returned Derdriu, \"until I have seen him.\"\r\n\r\nNoise justifies the young girl's expectations; he and his two brothers\r\nare incomparably valiant in war, and so swift are they that they outrun\r\nwild animals in the chase. Their songs are delightfully sweet. Noise is\r\naware of the druid's prophecy, and at first spurns Derdriu, but she\r\nconquers him by force. They love each other. Pursued by their enemies\r\nthe three brothers and Derdriu emigrate to Scotland, and take refuge\r\nwith the king of Albion. One day the king's steward \"sees Noise and his\r\nwife sleeping side by side. He went at once and awoke the king.\r\n\r\n\"'Till now,' he said, 'never had we found a woman worthy of thee; but\r\nthe one who lies in the arms of Noise is the one for thee, king of the\r\nWest! Cause Noise to be put to death, and marry his wife.'\r\n\r\n\"'No,' answered the king; 'but bid her come to me daily in secret.'\r\n\r\n\"The steward obeyed the king's commands, but in vain; what he told\r\nDerdriu by day she repeated to her husband the following night.\"\r\n\r\nThe sons of Usnech perish in an ambush. Conchobar seizes on Derdriu, but\r\nshe continues to love the dead. \"Derdriu passed a year with Conchobar;\r\nduring that time never was a smile seen on her lips; she ate not, slept\r\nnot, raised not her head from off her knees. When the musicians and\r\njugglers tried to cheer her grief by their play, she told ...\" she told\r\nher sorrow, and all that had made the delight of her life \"in a time\r\nthat was no more.\"\r\n\r\n\"I sleep not, I dye no more my nails with purple; lifeless is my soul,\r\nfor the sons of Usnech will return no more. I sleep not half the night\r\non my couch. My spirit travels around the multitudes. But I eat not,\r\nneither do I smile.\"\r\n\r\nConchobar out of revenge delivers her over for a year to the man she\r\nmost hates, the murderer of Noise, who bears her off on a chariot; and\r\nConchobar, watching this revolting sight, mocks her misery. She remains\r\nsilent. \"There in front of her rose a huge rock, she threw herself\r\nagainst it, her head struck and was shattered, and so she died.\"\r\n\r\nAn inexhaustible fertility of invention was displayed by the Celtic\r\nmakers. They created the cycle of Conchobar, and afterwards that of\r\nOssian, to which Macpherson's \"adaptations\" gave such world-wide renown\r\nthat in our own century they directed Lamartine's early steps towards\r\nthe realms of poetry. Later still they created the cycle of Arthur, most\r\nbrilliant and varied of all, a perennial source of poetry, from whence\r\nthe great French poet of the twelfth century sought his inspiration, and\r\nwhence only yesterday the poet laureate of England found his. They\r\ncollect in Wales the marvellous tales of the \"Mabinogion\"[20]; in them\r\nwe find enchanters and fairies, women with golden hair, silken raiment,\r\nand tender hearts. They hunt, and a white boar starts out of the bushes;\r\nfollowing him they arrive at a castle there, \"where never had they seen\r\ntrace of a building before.\" Pryderi ventures to penetrate into the\r\nprecincts: \"He entered and perceived neither man, nor beast; no boar, no\r\ndogs, no house, no place of habitation. On the ground towards the middle\r\nthere was a fountain surrounded by marble, and on the rim of the\r\nfountain, resting on a marble slab, was a golden cup, fastened by golden\r\nchains tending upwards, the ends of which he could not see. He was\r\nenraptured by the glitter of the gold, and the workmanship of the cup.\r\nHe drew near and grasped it. At the same instant his hands clove to the\r\ncup, and his feet to the marble slab on which it rested. He lost his\r\nvoice, and was unable to utter a word.\" The castle fades away; the land\r\nbecomes a desert once more; the heroes are changed into mice; the whole\r\nlooks like a fragment drawn out of Ariosto, by Perrault, and told by him\r\nin his own way to children.\r\n\r\nNo wonder if the descendants of these indefatigable inventors are men\r\nwith rich literatures, not meagre literatures of which it is possible to\r\nwrite a history without omitting anything, but deep and inexhaustible\r\nones. The ends of their golden chains are not to be seen. And if a\r\ncopious mixture of Celtic blood flows, though in different proportions,\r\nin the veins of the French and of the English, it will be no wonder if\r\nthey happen some day to produce the greater number of the plays that are\r\nacted, and of the novels that are read, all over the civilised world.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nAfter a second journey, during which he passed the Thames, Caesar\r\ndeparted with hostages, this time never to return. The real conquest\r\ntook place under the emperors, beginning from the reign of Claudius, and\r\nfor three centuries and a half Britain was occupied and ruled by the\r\nRomans. They built a network of roads, of which the remains still\r\nsubsist; they marked the distances by milestones, sixty of which have\r\nbeen found, and one, at Chesterholm, is still standing; they raised,\r\nfrom one sea to the other, against the people of Scotland, two great\r\nwalls; one of them in stone, flanked by towers, and protected by moats\r\nand earth-works.[21] Fortified after the Roman fashion, defended by\r\ngarrisons, the groups of British huts became cities; and villas, similar\r\nto those the remains of which are met with under the ashes of Pompeii\r\nand in the sands of Africa, rose in York, Bath, London, Lincoln,\r\nCirencester, Aldborough, Woodchester, Bignor, and in a multitude of\r\nother places where they have since been found. Beneath the shade of the\r\ndruidical oaks, the Roman glazier blew his light variegated flasks; the\r\nmosaic maker seated Orpheus on his panther, with his fingers on the\r\nThracian lyre. Altars were built to the Roman deities; later to the God\r\nof Bethlehem, and one at least of the churches of that period still\r\nsubsists, St. Martin of Canterbury.[22] Statues were raised for the\r\nemperors; coins were cast; weights were cut; ore was extracted from the\r\nmines; the potter moulded his clay vases, and, pending the time when\r\nthey should be exhibited behind the glass panes of the British Museum,\r\nthe legionaries used them to hold the ashes of their dead.\r\n\r\nHowever far he went, the Roman carried Rome with him; he required his\r\nstatues, his coloured pavements, his frescoes, his baths, all the\r\ncomforts and delights of the Latin cities. Theatres, temples, towers,\r\npalaces rose in many of the towns of Great Britain, and some years ago a\r\nbathing room was discovered at Bath[23] a hundred and eleven feet long.\r\nSeveral centuries later Gerald de Barry passing through Caerleon noticed\r\nwith admiration \"many remains of former grandeur, immense palaces ... a\r\ngigantic tower, magnificent baths, and ruined temples.\"[24] The emperors\r\ncould well come to Britain; they found themselves at home. Claudius,\r\nVespasian, Titus, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius came there, either to win the\r\ntitle of \"the Britannic\" or to enjoy the charms of peace. Severus died\r\nat York in 211, and Caracalla there began his reign. Constantius Chlorus\r\ncame to live in this town, and died there; and the prince destined to\r\nsanction the Romans' change of religion, Constantine the Great, was\r\nproclaimed emperor in the same city. Celtic Britain, the England that\r\nwas to be, had become Roman and Christian, a country of land tillers who\r\nmore or less spoke Latin.[25]\r\n\r\nBut the time of transformation was drawing nigh, and an enemy was\r\nalready visible, against whom neither Hadrian's wall nor Antoninus'\r\nramparts could prevail; for he came not from the Scottish mountains,\r\nbut, as he himself said in his war-songs, \"by the way of the whales.\" A\r\nnew race of men had appeared on the shores of the island. After relating\r\nthe campaigns of his father-in-law, Agricola, whose fleet had sailed\r\naround Britain and touched at the Orkneys, the attention of Tacitus had\r\nbeen drawn to Germany, a wild mysterious land. He had described it to\r\nhis countrymen; he had enumerated its principal tribes, and among many\r\nothers he had mentioned one which he calls _Angli_. He gives the name,\r\nand says no more, little suspecting the part these men were to play in\r\nhistory. The first act that was to make them famous throughout the world\r\nwas to overthrow the political order, and to sweep away the\r\ncivilisation, which the conquests of Agricola had established amongst\r\nthe Britons.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] On Pytheas, see Elton, \"Origins of English History,\" London, 1890,\r\n8vo (2nd ed.), pp. 12 and following.

For the\r\ninhabitants, however, this land of clouds and morasses is their home;\r\nthey love it, and they remain there.\r\n\r\nThe great historian's book shows how little of impenetrable Germany was\r\nknown to the Romans. All sorts of legends were current respecting this\r\nwild land, supposed to be bounded on the north-east by a slumbering sea,\r\n\"the girdle and limit of the world,\" a place so near to the spot where\r\nPhoebus rises \"that the sound he makes in emerging from the waters can\r\nbe heard, and the forms of his steeds are visible.\" This is the popular\r\nbelief, adds Tacitus; \"the truth is that nature ends there.\"[26]\r\n\r\nIn this mysterious land, between the forests that sheltered them from\r\nthe Romans and the grey sea washing with long waves the flat shores,\r\ntribes had settled and multiplied which, contrary to the surmise of\r\nTacitus, had perhaps left the mild climate of Asia for this barren\r\ncountry; and though they had at last made it their home, many of them\r\nwhose names alone figure in the Roman's book had not adopted it for\r\never; their migrations were about to begin again.\r\n\r\nThis group of Teutonic peoples, with ramifications extending far towards\r\nthe pole was divided into two principal branches: the Germanic branch,\r\nproperly so called, which comprised the Goths, Angles, Saxons, the upper\r\nand lower Germans, the Dutch, the Frisians, the Lombards, the Franks,\r\nthe Vandals, &c.; and the Scandinavian branch, settled farther north and\r\ncomposed of the Danes, Norwegians, and Swedes. The same region which\r\nTacitus describes as bordering on the place \"where nature ends,\" held\r\nthus in his day tribes that would later have for their capitals, towns\r\nfounded long before by Celts: London, Vienna, Paris, and Milan.\r\n\r\nMany hundred years before settling there, these men had already found\r\nthemselves in contact with the Celts, and, at the time the latter were\r\npowerful in Europe, terrible wars had arisen between the two races. But\r\nall the north-east, from the Elbe to the Vistula, continued\r\nimpenetrable; the Germanic tribes remained there intact, they united\r\nwith no others, and alone might have told if the sun's chariot was\r\nreally to be seen rising from the ocean, and splashing the sky with salt\r\nsea foam. From this region were about to start the wild host destined to\r\nconquer the isle of Britain, to change its name and rebaptize it in\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nTwice, during the first ten centuries of our era, the Teutonic race\r\nhurled upon the civilised world its savage hordes of warriors, streams\r\nof molten lava. The first invasion was vehement, especially in the fifth\r\ncentury, and was principally composed of Germanic tribes, Angles,\r\nFranks, Saxons, Burgundians, Vandals; the second exercised its greatest\r\nravages in the ninth century, at the time of Charlemagne's successors,\r\nand proceeded mostly from the Scandinavian tribes, called Danish or\r\nNorman by contemporary chroniclers.\r\n\r\nFrom the third century after Christ, fermentation begins among the\r\nformer of these two groups. No longer are the Germanic tribes content\r\nwith fighting for their land, retreating step by step before the Latin\r\ninvader; alarming symptoms of retaliation manifest themselves, like the\r\nrumblings that herald the great cataclysms of nature.\r\n\r\nThe Roman, in the meanwhile, wrapped in his glory, continued to rule the\r\nworld and mould it to his image; he skilfully enervated the conquered\r\nnations, instructed them in the arts, inoculated them with his vices,\r\nand weakened in them the spring of their formerly strong will. They\r\ncalled civilisation, _humanitas_, Tacitus said of the Britons, what was\r\nactually \"servitude.\"[27] The frontiers of the empire were now so far\r\ndistant that the roar of the advancing tide scarcely reached Rome. What\r\nwas overheard of it acted as a stimulus to pleasure, added point to the\r\nrhetorician's speeches, excitement to the circus games, and a halo to\r\nthe beauty of red-haired courtesans. The Romans had reached that point\r\nin tottering empires, at which the threat of calamities no longer\r\narouses dormant energy, but only whets and renews the appetite for\r\nenjoyment.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, far away towards the north, the Germanic tribes, continually\r\nat strife with their neighbours, and warring against each other, without\r\nriches or culture, ignorant and savage, preserved their strength and\r\nkept their ferocity. They hated peace, despised the arts, and had no\r\nliterature but drinking and war-songs. They take an interest only in\r\nhunting and war, said Caesar; from their earliest infancy they endeavour\r\nto harden themselves physically.[28] They were not inventive; they\r\nlearned with more difficulty than the Celts; they were violent and\r\nirrepressible. The little that is known of their customs and character\r\npoints to fiery souls that may rise to great rapturous joys but have an\r\nunderlayer of gloom, a gloom sombre as the impenetrable forest, sad as\r\nthe grey sea. For them the woods are haunted, the shades of night are\r\npeopled with evil spirits, in their morasses half-divine monsters lie\r\ncoiled. \"They worship demons,\" wrote the Christian chroniclers of them\r\nwith a sort of terror.[29] These men will enjoy lyric songs, but not\r\ncharming tales; they are capable of mirth but not of gaiety; powerful\r\nbut incomplete natures that will need to develop fully without having to\r\nwait for the slow procedure of centuries, an admixture of new blood and\r\nnew ideas. They were to find in Britain this double graft, and an\r\nadmirable literary development was to be the consequence. They set out\r\nthen to accomplish their work and follow their destiny, having doubtless\r\nmuch to learn, but having also something to teach the enervated nations,\r\nthe meaning of a word unknown till their coming, the word \"war\"\r\n(_guerre, guerra_). After the time of the invasions \"bellicose,\"\r\n\"belliqueux,\" and such words lost their strength and dignity, and were\r\nleft for songsters to play with if they liked; a tiny phenomenon, the\r\nsign of terrible transformations.\r\n\r\nThe invaders bore various names. The boundaries of their tribes, as\r\nregards population and territory, were vague, and in nowise resembled\r\nthose of the kingdoms traced on our maps. Their groups united and\r\ndissolved continually. The most powerful among them absorb their\r\nneighbours and cause them to be forgotten for a time, their names\r\nfrequently recur in histories; then other tribes grow up; other names\r\nappear, others die out. Several of them, however, have survived: Angles,\r\nFranks, Saxons, Burgundians, Lombards, Suevi, and Alemanni, which became\r\nthe names of great provinces or mighty nations. The more important of\r\nthese groups were rather an agglomeration of tribes than nations\r\nproperly so called; thus under the name of Franks were comprised, in the\r\nthird century, the Sicambers, the Chatti, the Chamavi; while the Suevi\r\nunited, in the time of Tacitus, the Lombards, Semnones, Angles, and\r\nothers. But all were bound by the tie of a common origin; their\r\npassions, customs, and tastes, their arms and costumes were similar.[30]\r\n\r\nThis human multitude once put in motion, nothing was able to stop it,\r\nneither the military tactics of the legions nor the defeats which it\r\nsuffered; neither rivers nor mountains, nor the dangers of unknown seas.\r\nThe Franks, before settling in Gaul, traversed it once from end to end,\r\ncrossed the Pyrenees, ravaged Spain, and disappeared in Mauritania.\r\nTransported once in great numbers to the shores of the Euxine Sea, and\r\nimprudently entrusted by the Romans with the defence of their frontiers,\r\nthey embark, pillage the towns of Asia and Northern Africa, and return\r\nto the mouth of the Rhine. Their expeditions intercross each other; we\r\nfind them everywhere at once; Franks are seen at London, and Saxons at\r\nAngers. In 406, Gaul is overrun with barbarians, Vandals, Saxons,\r\nBurgundians, Alemanni; every point of the territory is in flames; the\r\nnoise of a falling empire reaches St. Jerome, in his cell at Bethlehem,\r\nand in an eloquent letter he deplores the disaster of Christendom: \"Who\r\ncould ever have believed the day would come when Rome should see war at\r\nher very gates, and fight, not for glory but for safety? Fight, say I?\r\nNay, redeem her life with treasure.\"[31]\r\n\r\nTreasure did not suffice; the town was taken and retaken. Alaric sacked\r\nthe capital in 410, and Genseric in 455. During several centuries all\r\nwho emerge from this human tide, and are able to rule the tempest, are\r\neither barbarians or crowned peasants. In the fifth and sixth centuries\r\na Frank reigns at Paris, Clovis to wit; an Ostrogoth at Ravenna,\r\nTheodoric; a peasant at Byzantium, Justinian; Attila's conqueror,\r\nAetius, is a barbarian; Stilicho is a Vandal in the service of the\r\nEmpire. A Frank kingdom has grown up in the heart of Gaul; a Visigoth\r\nkingdom has Toulouse for its capital; Genseric and his Vandals are\r\nsettled in Carthage; the Lombards, in the sixth century, cross the\r\nmountains, establish themselves in ancient Cisalpine Gaul, and drive\r\naway the inhabitants towards the lagoons where Venice is to rise. The\r\nisle of Britain has likewise ceased to be Roman, and Germanic kingdoms\r\nhave been founded there.\r\n\r\nMounted on their ships, sixty to eighty feet long, by ten or fifteen\r\nbroad, of which a specimen can be seen at the museum of Kiel,[32] the\r\ndwellers on the shores of the Baltic and North Sea had at first\r\norganised plundering expeditions against the great island. They came\r\nperiodically and laid waste the coasts; and on account of them the\r\ninhabitants gave to this part of the land the name _Littus Saxonicum_.\r\nEach time the pirates met with less resistance, and found the country\r\nmore disorganised. In the course of the fifth century they saw they had\r\nno need to return annually to their morasses, and that they could\r\nwithout trouble remain within reach of plunder. They settled first in\r\nthe islands, then on the coasts, and by degrees in the interior. Among\r\nthem were Goths or Jutes of Denmark (Jutland), Frisians, Franks, Angles\r\nfrom Schleswig, and Saxons from the vast lands between the Elbe and\r\nRhine.\r\n\r\nThese last two, especially, came in great numbers, occupied wide\r\nterritories, and founded lasting kingdoms. The Angles, whose name was to\r\nremain affixed to the whole nation, occupied Northumberland, a part of\r\nthe centre, and the north-east coast, from Scotland to the present\r\ncounty of Essex; the Saxons settled further south, in the regions which\r\nwere called from them Essex, Sussex, Middlesex, and Wessex: Saxons of\r\nthe east, south, centre, and west. It was in these two groups of\r\ntribes, or kingdoms, that literature reached the greatest development,\r\nand it was principally between them also that the struggle for supremacy\r\nset in, after the conquest. Hence the name of Anglo-Saxons generally\r\ngiven to the inhabitants of the soil, in respect of the period during\r\nwhich purely Germanic dialects were spoken in England. This composite\r\nword, recently the cause of many quarrels, has the advantage of being\r\nclear; long habit is in its favour; and its very form suits an epoch\r\nwhen the country was not unified, but belonged to two principal\r\nagglomerations of tribes, that of the Angles and that of the Saxons.[33]\r\n\r\nIn the same way as in Gaul, the invaders found themselves in the\r\npresence of a people infinitely more civilised than themselves, skilled\r\nin the arts, excellent agriculturists, rich traders, on whose soil arose\r\nthose large towns that the Romans had fortified, and connected by roads.\r\nNever had they beheld anything like it, nor had they names for such\r\nthings. They had in consequence to make additions to their vocabulary.\r\nNot knowing how to designate these unfamiliar objects, they left them\r\nthe names they bore in the language of the inhabitants: _castrum_,\r\n_strata_, _colonia_; which became in their language _chester_, _street_,\r\nor _strat_, as in Stratford, and _coln_ as in Lincoln.\r\n\r\nThe Britons who had taken to the toga--\"frequens toga,\" says\r\nTacitus--and who were no longer protected by the legions, made a vain\r\nresistance; the advancing tide of barbarians swept over them, they\r\nceased to exist as a nation. Contributions were levied on the cities,\r\nthe country was laid waste, villas were razed to the ground, and on all\r\nthe points where the natives endeavoured to face the enemy, fearful\r\nhecatombs were slaughtered by the worshippers of Woden.\r\n\r\nThey could not, however, destroy all; and here comes in the important\r\nquestion of Celtic survival. Some admirers of the conquerors credit them\r\nwith superhuman massacres. According to them no Celt survived; and the\r\nrace, we are told, was either driven back into Wales or destroyed, so\r\nthat the whole land had to be repopulated, and that a new and wholly\r\nGermanic nation, as pure in blood as the tribes on the banks of the\r\nElbe, grew up on British soil. But if facts are examined it will be\r\nfound that this title to glory cannot be claimed for the invaders. The\r\ndeed was an impossible one; let that be their excuse. To destroy a whole\r\nnation by the sword exceeds human power, and there is no example of it.\r\nWe know, besides, that in this case the task would have been an\r\nespecially hard one, for the population of Britain, even at the time of\r\nCaesar, was dense: _hominum infinita multitudo_, he says in his\r\nCommentaries. The invaders, on the other hand, found themselves in\r\npresence of an intelligent, laborious, assimilable race, trained by the\r\nRomans to usefulness. The first of these facts precludes the hypothesis\r\nof a general massacre; and the second the hypothesis of a total\r\nexpulsion, or of such extinction as threatens the inassimilable native\r\nof Australia.\r\n\r\nIn reality, all the documents which have come down to us, and all the\r\nverifications made on the ground, contradict the theory of an\r\nannihilation of the Celtic race. To begin with, we can imagine no\r\nsystematic destruction after the introduction of Christianity among the\r\nAnglo-Saxons, which took place at the end of the sixth century. Then,\r\nthe chroniclers speak of a general massacre of the inhabitants, in\r\nconnection with two places only: Chester and Anderida.[34] We can\r\nascertain even to-day that in one of these cases the destruction\r\ncertainly was complete, since this last town was never rebuilt, and only\r\nits site is known. That the chroniclers should make a special mention of\r\nthe two massacres proves these cases were exceptional. To argue from the\r\ndestruction of Anderida to the slaughter of the entire race would be as\r\nlittle reasonable as to imagine that the whole of the Gallo-Romans were\r\nannihilated because the ruins of a Gallo-Roman city, with a theatre\r\nseating seven thousand people have been discovered in a spot uninhabited\r\nto-day, near Sanxay in Poictou. Excavations recently made in England\r\nhave shown, in a great number of cemeteries, even in the region termed\r\n_Littus Saxonicum_, where the Germanic population was densest, Britons\r\nand Saxons sleeping side by side, and nothing could better point to\r\ntheir having lived also side by side. Had a wholesale massacre taken\r\nplace, the victims would have had no sepulchres, or at all events they\r\nwould not have had them amongst those of the slayers.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, it is only by the preservation of the\r\npre-established race that the change in manners and customs, and the\r\nrapid development of the Anglo-Saxons can be explained. These roving\r\npirates lose their taste for maritime adventure; they build no more\r\nships; their intestine quarrels are food sufficient for what is left of\r\ntheir warlike appetites. Whence comes it that the instincts of this\r\nimpetuous race are to some degree moderated? Doubtless from the quantity\r\nand fertility of the land they had conquered, and from the facility they\r\nfound on the spot for turning that land to account. These facilities\r\nconsisted in the labour of others. The taste for agriculture did not\r\nbelong to the race. Tacitus represents the Germans as cultivating only\r\nwhat was strictly necessary.[35] The Anglo-Saxons found in Britain wide\r\ntracts of country tilled by romanised husbandmen; after the time of the\r\nfirst ravages they recalled them to their toil, but assigned its fruits\r\nto themselves. Well, therefore, might the same word be used by the\r\nconquerors to designate the native Celt and the slave. They established\r\nthemselves in the fields, and superintended their cultivation after\r\ntheir fashion; their encampments became boroughs: Nottingham,\r\nBuckingham, Glastonbury, which have to the present day retained the\r\nnames of Germanic families or tribes. The towns of more ancient\r\nimportance, on the contrary, have retained Celtic or Latin names:\r\nLondon, York, Lincoln, Winchester, Dover, Cirencester, Manchester,\r\n&c.[36] The Anglo-Saxons did not destroy them, since they are still\r\nextant, and only mingled in a feeble proportion with their population,\r\nhaving, like all Germans, a horror of sojourning in cities. \"They\r\navoided them, regarding them as tombs,\" they thought that to live in\r\ntowns was like burying oneself alive.[37] The preservation in England of\r\nseveral branches of Roman industry is one proof more of the continuance\r\nof city life in the island; had the British artisans not survived the\r\ninvasion, there would never have been found in the tombs of the\r\nconquerors those glass cups of elaborate ornamentation, hardly\r\ndistinguishable from the products of the Roman glass-works, and which\r\nthe clumsy hands of the Saxon were certainly incapable of fusing and\r\nadorning.[38]\r\n\r\nThe Britons, then, subsist in large numbers, even in the eastern and\r\nsouthern counties, where the Germanic settlement was most dense, but\r\nthey subsist as a conquered race; they till the ground in the country,\r\nand in the cities occupy themselves with manual labour. Wales and\r\nCornwall alone, in the isle of Britain, were still places of refuge for\r\nindependent Celts. The idiom and traditions of the ancient inhabitants\r\nwere there preserved. In these distant retreats, at the foot of Snowdon,\r\nin the valley of St. David's, beneath the trees of Caerleon, popular\r\nsingers accompany on their harps the old national poems; perhaps they\r\neven begin to chaunt those tales telling of the exploits of a hero\r\ndestined to the highest renown in literature, King Arthur.\r\n\r\nBut in the heart of the country the national tongue had been for a long\r\ntime constantly losing ground; the Britons had learnt Latin, many of\r\nthem; they now forget it by degrees, as they had previously forgotten\r\nCeltic, and learn instead the language of their new masters. It was one\r\nof their national gifts, a precious and fatal one; they were swift to\r\nlearn.\r\n\r\nIn France the result of the Germanic conquest was totally different; the\r\nCeltic language reappeared there no more than in England. It has only\r\nsurvived in the extreme west.[39] But in France the Germanic idiom did\r\nnot overpower the Latin; the latter persisted, so much so that the\r\nFrench tongue has remained a Romance language. This is owing to two\r\ngreat causes. Firstly, the Germans came to France in much smaller\r\nnumbers than to England, and those that remained had been long in\r\ncontact with the Romans; secondly, the romanising of Gaul had been more\r\ncomplete. Of all the provinces of the Empire, Gaul, the birthplace of\r\nCornelius Gallus, Trogus Pompeius, Domitius Afer, Petronius, Ausonius,\r\nSidonius Apollinaris, prided itself on speaking the purest Latin, and on\r\nproducing the best poets. Whether we take material monuments or literary\r\nones, the difference is the same in the two countries. In England\r\ntheatres, towers, temples, all marks of Latin civilisation, had been\r\nerected, but not so numerous, massive, or strong that the invaders were\r\nunable to destroy them. At the present time only shapeless remnants\r\nexist above ground. In France, the barbarians came, plundered, burnt,\r\nrazed to the ground all they possibly could; but the work of destruction\r\nwas too great, the multitude of temples and palaces was more than their\r\nstrength was equal to, and the torch fell from their tired hands.\r\nWhereas in England excavations are made in order to discover the\r\nremains of ancient Latin civilisation, in France we need only raise our\r\neyes to behold them. Could the grave give up a Roman of the time of the\r\nCaesars, he would still at this day be able to worship his divine\r\nemperors in the temples of Nimes and Vienne; pass, when entering Reims,\r\nOrange, or Saintes under triumphal arches erected by his ancestors; he\r\nmight recognise their tombs at the \"Aliscamps\" of Arles; could see\r\n_Antigone_ played at Orange, and seated on the gradines of the\r\namphitheatre, facing the blue horizon of Provence, still behold blood\r\nflowing in the arena.\r\n\r\nGaul was not, like Britain, disorganised and deprived of its legions\r\nwhen the Germanic hordes appeared; the victor had to reckon with the\r\nvanquished; the latter became not a slave but an ally, and this\r\nadvantage, added to that of superior numbers and civilisation, allowed\r\nthe Gallo-Roman to reconquer the invader. Latin tradition was so\r\npowerful that it was accepted by Clovis himself. That long-haired\r\nchieftain donned the toga and chlamys; he became a _patrice_; although\r\nhe knew by experience that he derived his power from his sword, it\r\npleased him to ascribe it to the emperor. He had an instinct of what\r\nRome was. The prestige of the emperor was worth an army to him, and\r\nassisted him to rule his latinised subjects. Conquered, pillaged,\r\nsacked, and ruined, the Eternal City still remained fruitful within her\r\ncrumbling walls. Under the ruins subsisted living seeds, one, amongst\r\nothers, most important of all, containing the great Roman idea, the\r\nnotion of the State. The Celts hardly grasped it, the Germans only at a\r\nlate period. Clovis, barbarian though he was, became imbued with it. He\r\nendeavoured to mould his subjects, Franks, Gallo-Romans, and Visigoths,\r\nso as to form a State, and in spite of the disasters that followed, his\r\nefforts were not without some durable results.\r\n\r\nIn France the vanquished taught the victors their language; the\r\ngrandsons of Clovis wrote Latin verses; and it is owing to poems written\r\nin a Romance idiom that Karl the Frank became the \"Charlemagne\" of\r\nlegend and history; so that at last the new empire founded in Gaul had\r\nnothing Germanic save the name. The name, however, has survived, and is\r\nthe name of France.\r\n\r\nThus, and not by an impossible massacre, can be explained the different\r\nresults of the invasions in France and England. In both countries, but\r\nless abundantly in the latter, the Celtic race has been perpetuated, and\r\nthe veil which covers it to-day, a Latin or Germanic tissue, is neither\r\nso close nor so thick that we cannot distinguish through its folds the\r\nforms of British or Gaulish genius; a very special and easily\r\nrecognisable genius, very different from that of the ancients, and\r\ndiffering still more from that of the Teutonic invaders.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[26] \"De Moribus Germanorum,\" b. ii. chap. xlv.\r\n\r\n[27] \"Agricola,\" xxi.\r\n\r\n[28] \"Vita omnis in venationibus atque in studiis rei militaris\r\nconstitit; ab parvulis labori ac duritiei student.\" \"De Bello Gallico,\"\r\nbook vi.\r\n\r\n[29] \"Saxones, sicut omnes fere Germaniam incolentes nationes, et natura\r\nferoces et cultui daemonum dediti.\" Eginhard, \"Vita Karoli,\" vii.\r\n\r\n[30] The arms of the Franks and those of the Anglo-Saxons, the former\r\npreserved in the Museum of St. Germain, and the latter in the British\r\nMuseum, are similar, and differ widely from those of the Celts. The\r\nshields, a part of the equipment, which among all nations are found\r\nhighly ornamented, were equally plain with the Franks and Angles; the\r\n_umbo_ or boss in the centre was, in those of both nations, of iron, and\r\nshaped like a rude dish-cover, which has often caused them to be\r\ncatalogued as helmets or military head-pieces.\r\n\r\n[31] \"Innumerabiles et ferocissimae nationes universas Gallias\r\noccuparunt.... Quis hoc crederet?... Romam in gremio suo non pro gloria,\r\nsed pro salute pugnare? Imo ne pugnare quidem, sed auro et cuncta\r\nsupellectile vitam redimere.\" Epistola cxxiii. ad Ageruchiam, in the\r\n\"Patrologia\" of Migne, vol. xxii., col. 1057-8.\r\n\r\n[32] This ship was discovered in 1863 in a peat bog of Schleswig; that\r\nis in the very country of the Angles; judging by the coins found at the\r\nsame time, it must belong to the third century. It measures 22 metres 67\r\ncentimetres in length, 3 metres, 33 centim. in breadth, and 1 metre 19\r\ncentim. in height. Specimens of Scandinavian ships have also been\r\ndiscovered. When a chief died his ship was buried with him, as his\r\nchariot or horse was in other countries. A description of a Scandinavian\r\nfuneral (the chief placed on his boat, with his arms, and burnt,\r\ntogether with a woman and some animals killed for the occasion) has been\r\nhanded down to us in the narrative of the Arab Ahmed Ibn Fozlan, sent by\r\nthe caliph Al Moktader, in the tenth century, as ambassador to a\r\nScandinavian king established on the banks of the Volga (_Journal\r\nAsiatique_, 1825, vol. vi. pp. 16 ff.). In some cases there was an\r\ninterment but no incineration, and thus it is that Norse ships have been\r\nfound. Two of these precious relics are preserved in the museum of\r\nChristiania. One of them, discovered in 1880, constructed out of oaken\r\nplanks held together by iron nails, still retained several of its oars;\r\nthey were about seven yards long, and must have been thirty-two, sixteen\r\non each side. This measurement seems to have been normal, for the\r\n\"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" says that Alfred had ships built twice the size\r\nof ordinary ships, and gave them \"sixty oars or more\" (_sub anno_ 897).\r\nA ship constructed on the exact model of the Scandinavian barks went\r\nfrom Bergen to New York at the time of the Chicago Exhibition, 1893. It\r\nwas found to be perfectly seaworthy, even in rough weather.\r\n\r\n[33] It may be added in favour of this same word that it is difficult to\r\nreplace it by another as clear and convenient. Some have proposed \"Old\r\nEnglish,\" an expression considered as having the advantage of better\r\nrepresenting the continuity of the national history, and marking less\r\nconspicuously the break occasioned by the Norman Conquest. \"Anglo-Saxon\"\r\nbefore the Conquest, \"English\" after, implies a radical change, a sort\r\nof renovation in the people of England. It is added, too, that this\r\npeople already bore in the days of King Alfred the name of English. But\r\nbesides the above-mentioned reasons, it may be pointed out that this\r\nbreak and this renovation are historical facts. In language, for\r\nexample, the changes have been such that, as it has been justly\r\nobserved, classical English resembles Anglo-Saxon less than the Italian\r\nof to-day resembles Latin. Still it would not be considered wise on the\r\npart of the Italians to give the name of \"Old Italians\" to their Roman\r\nancestors, though they spoke a similar language, were of the same blood,\r\nlived in the same land, and called it by the same name. As for Alfred,\r\nhe calls himself sometimes king of the Saxons \"rex Saxonum,\" sometimes\r\nking of the Angles, sometimes king of the Anglo-Saxons: \"AEgo Aelfredus,\r\ngratia Dei, Angol Saxonum rex.\" AEthelstan again calls himself \"rex\r\nAngul-Saxonum\" (Kemble, \"Codex\" ii. p. 124; Grein, \"Anglia,\" i. p. 1; de\r\nGray Birch, \"Cartularium Saxonicum,\" 1885, ii. p. 333). They never call\r\nthemselves, as may be believed, \"Old English.\" The word, besides, is not\r\nof an easy use. In a recent work one of the greatest historians of our\r\nday, Mr. Freeman, spoke of people who were \"men of old English birth\";\r\nevidently it would have been simpler and clearer to call them\r\nAnglo-Saxons.\r\n\r\n[34] \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle,\" Rolls, _sub anno_ 491.\r\n\r\n[35] \"De Moribus Germanorum,\" xv., xxvi.\r\n\r\n[36] Names of villages recalling German clans or families are very\r\nnumerous on the eastern and southern coasts. \"They diminish rapidly as\r\nwe move inland, and they die away altogether as we approach the purely\r\nCeltic west.

Tacitus says the same thing for the whole of the\r\nGermans: \"Nullas Germanorum populis urbes habitari, satis notum est....\r\nColunt discreti ac diversi, ut fons, ut campus, ut nemus placuit. Vicos\r\nlocant, non in nostrum morem, connexis et cohaerentibus aedificiis: suam\r\nquisque domum spatio circumdat.\" \"De Moribus Germanorum,\" xvi.\r\n\r\n[38] It seems impossible to admit, as has been suggested, that these\r\nfrail objects should have been saved from the plunder and burning of the\r\nvillas and preserved by the Anglo-Saxons as _curiosities_. Glasses with\r\nknobs, \"_a larmes_,\" abound in the Anglo-Saxon tombs, and similar ones\r\nhave been found in the Roman tombs of an earlier epoch, notably at\r\nLepine, in the department of the Marne.\r\n\r\n[39] Where the Celtic element was reinforced, at the commencement of the\r\nsixth century, by a considerable immigration of Britons driven from\r\nEngland. Hence the name of Bretagne, given then for the first time to\r\nArmorica.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n_THE NATIONAL POETRY OF THE ANGLO-SAXONS._\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the fifth century, the greater part of England was\r\nconquered; the rulers of the land were no longer Celts or Romans, but\r\nmen of Germanic origin, who worshipped Thor and Woden instead of Christ,\r\nand whose language, customs, and religion differed entirely from those\r\nof the people they had settled amongst and subjugated.\r\n\r\nThe force of circumstances produced a fusion of the two races, but\r\nduring many centuries no literary fusion took place. The mind of the\r\ninvader was not actuated by curiosity; he intrenched himself in his\r\ntastes, content with his own literature. \"Each one,\" wrote Tacitus of\r\nthe Germans, \"leaves an open space around his dwelling.\" The\r\nAnglo-Saxons remained in literature a people of isolated dwellings. They\r\ndid not allow the traditions of the vanquished Celts to blend with\r\ntheirs, and, in spite of their conversion to Christianity, they\r\npreserved, almost without change, the main characteristics of the race\r\nfrom which they were descended.\r\n\r\nTheir vocabulary, save for the introduction of a few words, taken from\r\nthe Church Latin, their grammar, their prosody, all remain Germanic. In\r\ntheir verse the cadence is marked, not by an equal number of syllables,\r\nbut by about the same number of accents; they have not the recurring\r\nsounds of rhyme, but they have, like the Germans and Scandinavians,\r\n_alliteration_, that is, the repetition of the same letters at the\r\nbeginning of certain syllables. \"Each long verse has four accented\r\nsyllables, while the number of unaccented syllables is indifferent, and\r\nis divided by the caesura into two short verses, bound together by\r\nalliteration: two accented syllables in the first short line and one in\r\nthe second, beginning with any vowel or the same consonant\"[40] (or\r\nconsonants giving about the same sound):\r\n\r\n    _F_lod under _f_oldan | nis thaet _f_eor heonon.\r\n\r\n\"The water sinks underground; it is not far from here.\" (_Beowulf._) The\r\nrules of this prosody, not very difficult in themselves, are made still\r\neasier by a number of licenses and exceptions. The taste for\r\nalliteration was destined to survive; it has never completely\r\ndisappeared in England. We find this ornamentation even in the Latin of\r\npoets posterior to the Norman Conquest, like Joseph of Exeter in the\r\ntwelfth century:\r\n\r\n                            _Au_dit et _au_det\r\n    Dux _f_alli: _f_atisque _f_avet quum _f_ata recuset.[41]\r\n\r\nThe famous Visions of Langland, in the fourteenth century, are in\r\nalliterative verse; under Elizabeth alliteration became one of the\r\npeculiarities of the florid prose called Euphuism. Nearer to our own\r\ntime, Byron makes a frequent use of alliteration:\r\n\r\n                                            Our bay\r\n    Receives that prow which proudly spurns the spray;\r\n    How gloriously her gallant course she goes:\r\n    Her white wings flying--never from her foes. (_Corsair._)\r\n\r\nThe purely Germanic period of the literary history of England lasted six\r\nhundred years, that is, for about the same length of time as divides us\r\nfrom the reign of Henry III. Rarely has a literature been more\r\nconsistent with itself than the literature of the Anglo-Saxons. They\r\nwere not as the Celts, quick to learn; they had not the curiosity,\r\nloquacity, taste for art which were found in the subjugated race. They\r\ndeveloped slowly. Those steady qualities which were to save the\r\nAnglo-Saxon genius from the absolute destruction which threatened it at\r\nthe time of the Norman Conquest resulted in the production of literary\r\nworks evincing, one and all, such a similitude in tastes, tendencies,\r\nand feelings that it is extremely difficult to date and localise them.\r\nAt the furthest end of the period, the Anglo-Saxons continued to enjoy,\r\nChristian as they were, and in more and more intimate contact with\r\nlatinised races, legends and traditions going back to the pagan days,\r\nnay, to the days of their continental life by the shores of the Baltic.\r\nLate manuscripts have preserved for us their oldest conceptions, by\r\nwhich is shown the continuity of taste for them. The early pagan\r\ncharacter of some of the poetry in \"Beowulf,\" in \"Widsith,\" in the\r\n\"Lament of Deor,\" is undoubted; still those poems continued to be copied\r\nup to the last century of the Anglo-Saxon rule; it is, in fact, only in\r\nmanuscripts of that date that we have them. An immense amount of labour,\r\ningenuity, and knowledge has been spent on questions of date and place,\r\nbut the difficulty is such, and that literature forms such a compact\r\nwhole, that the best and highest authorities have come on all points to\r\ncontrary conclusions. The very greatness of their labour and amplitude\r\nof their science happens thus to be the best proof of the singular\r\ncohesion between the various produce of the Anglo-Saxon mind. Of all the\r\npoets of the period, the one who had the strongest individuality, as\r\nwell as the greatest genius, one whom we know by name, Cynewulf, the\r\nonly one whose works are authentic, being signed, who thus offered the\r\nbest chance to critics, has caused as many disagreements among them as\r\nany stray leaf of parchment in the whole collection of Anglo-Saxon\r\npoetry. According to Ten Brink he was born between 720 and 730;\r\naccording to Earle he more probably lived in the eleventh century, at\r\nthe other end of the period.[42] One authority sees in his works the\r\ncharacteristics of the poetry of Northumbria, another inclines towards\r\nMercia. All possible dates have been assigned to the beautiful poem of\r\n\"Judith,\" from the seventh to the tenth century. \"Beowulf\" was written\r\nin Northumbria according to Stopford Brooke, in Mercia according to\r\nEarle, in Wessex according to Ten Brink. The attribution of \"Andreas\" to\r\nCynewulf has just been renewed by Gollancz, and denied by Fritzsche.\r\n\"Dream of the Rood\" follows similar fluctuations. The truth is that\r\nwhile there were doubtless movement and development in Anglo-Saxon\r\npoetry, as in all human things, they were very slow and difficult to\r\nmeasure. When material facts and landmarks are discovered, still it will\r\nremain true that till then authorities, judging poems on their own\r\nmerits, could not agree as to their classification, so little apparent\r\nwas the movement they represent. Anglo-Saxon poetry is like the river\r\nSaone; one doubts which way it flows.\r\n\r\nLet us therefore take this literature as a whole, and confess that the\r\ndivision here adopted, of national and worldly and of religious\r\nliterature, is arbitrary, and is merely used for the sake of\r\nconvenience. Religious and worldly, northern and southern literature\r\noverlap; but they most decidedly belong to the same Anglo-Saxon whole.\r\n\r\nThis whole has strong characteristics of its own, a force, a passion, a\r\ngrandeur, unexampled at that day. Contrary to what is found in Celtic\r\nliterature, there is no place in the monuments of Anglo-Saxon thought\r\nfor either light gaiety, or those shades of feeling which the Celts\r\ncould already express at that remote period. The new settlers are\r\nstrong, but not agile. Of the two master passions attributed by Cato to\r\nthe inhabitants of Gaul, one alone, the love of war, _rem militarem_, is\r\nshared by the dwellers on the shores of the northern ocean; the other,\r\n_argute loqui_, is unknown to them.\r\n\r\nMembers of the same family of nations established by the shores of the\r\nNorth Sea, as the classic nations were on the Mediterranean coasts in\r\nthe time of the emperors, the Anglo-Saxon, the German, and the\r\nScandinavian tribes spoke dialects of the same tongue, preserved common\r\ntraditions and the memory of an identical origin. Grein has collected in\r\nhis \"Anglo-Saxon Library\" all that remains of the ancient literature of\r\nEngland; Powell and Vigfusson have comprised in their \"Corpus Poeticum\r\nBoreale\" all we possess in the way of poems in the Scandinavian tongue,\r\nformerly composed in Denmark, Norway, the Orkneys, Iceland, and even\r\nGreenland, within the Arctic circle.[43] The resemblances between the\r\ntwo collections are striking, the differences are few. In both series\r\nit seems as if the same people were revealing its origins, and leading\r\nits heroes to Walhalla.[44] The Anglo-Saxon tale of Beowulf and the\r\nScandinavian saga of Gretti, the Anglo-Saxon story of Waldhere and the\r\nScandinavian and Germanic tale of the Niblungs and Volsungs,[45] turn on\r\nthe same incidents or are dedicated to the same heroes, represent a\r\nsimilar ideal of life, similar manners, the same race. They are all of\r\nthem part of the literary patrimony common to the men of the North.\r\n\r\nAs happened with the Celts, the greater number of the monuments of\r\nancient Germanic and Scandinavian literature has been preserved in the\r\nremotest of the countries where the race established itself; distance\r\nhaving better sheltered it from wars, the songs and manuscripts were\r\nmore easily saved from destruction. Most of the Celtic tales extant at\r\nthis day have been preserved in Ireland; and most of the pieces\r\ncollected in the \"Corpus Poeticum Boreale\" have been taken from\r\nIcelandic documents.\r\n\r\nManners and beliefs of the northern people are abundantly illustrated by\r\nthe poems included in this collection. We find ourselves amid giants and\r\ndwarfs, monsters, dragons, unconquerable heroes, bloody battles, gloomy\r\nomens, magic spells, and enchanted treasures. The poet leads us through\r\nhalls with ornamented seats, on which warriors spend long hours in\r\ndrinking; to pits full of serpents into which the vanquished are thrown;\r\nin the midst of dismal landscapes where gibbeted corpses swing in the\r\nwind; to mysterious islands where whirlwinds of flame shoot from the\r\ntombs, and where the heroine arrives on her ships, her \"ocean steeds,\"\r\nto evoke the paternal shade, behold once more the beloved being in the\r\nmidst of infernal fires, and receive from his hands the enchanted and\r\navenging sword. Armed Valkyrias cross the sky; ravens comment on the\r\nactions of men; the tone is sad and doleful, sometimes so curt and\r\nabrupt that, in order to follow the poet's fantastic imaginations, a\r\nmarginal commentary would be necessary, as for the \"Ancient Mariner\" of\r\nColeridge, in whom lives again something of the spirit of this\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nScenes of slaughter and torture abound of course, as they do with all\r\nprimitive nations; the victims laugh in the midst of their sufferings;\r\nthey sing their death-song. Sigfried roasts the heart of his adversary,\r\nFafni, the man-serpent, and eats it. Eormunrek's feet and hands are cut\r\noff and thrown into the fire before his eyes. Skirni, in order to win\r\nGerda's love for his master, heaps curses upon her, threatens to cut off\r\nher head, and by these means succeeds in his embassy.[46] Gunnar,\r\nwanting to keep for himself the secret of the Niblungen treasure, asks\r\nfor the heart of his own brother, Hogni:\r\n\r\n\"Hogni's bleeding heart must be laid in my hand, carved with the\r\nkeen-cutting knife out of the breast of the good knight.\r\n\r\n\"They carved the heart of Hialli (the thrall) from out his breast, and\r\nlaid it bleeding on a charger, and bore it to Gunnar.\r\n\r\n\"Then spake Gunnar, king of men: 'Here I have the heart of Hialli the\r\ncoward, unlike the heart of Hogni the brave. It quakes greatly as it\r\nlies on the charger, but it quaked twice as much when it lay in his\r\nbreast.'\r\n\r\n\"Hogni laughed when they cut out the quick heart of that crested hero;\r\nhe had little thought of whimpering. They laid it bleeding on the\r\ncharger and bore it before Gunnar.\r\n\r\n\"Then spake Gunnar, the Hniflungs' hero: 'Here I have the heart of Hogni\r\nthe brave, unlike the heart of Hialli the coward; it quakes very little\r\nas it lies on the charger, but it quaked much less when it lay in his\r\nbreast.'\"\r\n\r\nJustice being thus done to his brother, and feeling no regret, Gunnar's\r\njoy breaks forth; he alone now possesses the secret of the Niblungen\r\n(Hniflungs') treasure, and \"the great rings shall gleam in the rolling\r\nwaters rather than they shall shine on the hands of the sons of the\r\nHuns.\"[47]\r\n\r\nFrom this example, and from others which it would be easy to add, it can\r\nbe inferred that _nuances_ and refined sentiments escape the\r\ncomprehension of such heroes; they waste no time in describing things of\r\nbeauty; they care not if earth brings forth flowers, or if women have\r\ncheeks \"purple as the fox-glove.\" Neither have these men any aptitude\r\nfor light repartee; they do not play, they kill; their jests fell the\r\nadversary to the ground. \"Thou hast eaten the fresh-bleeding hearts of\r\nthy sons, mixed with honey, thou giver of swords,\" says Queen Gudrun to\r\nAttila, the historic king of the Huns, who, in this literature, has\r\nbecome the typical foreign hero; \"now thou shalt digest the gory flesh\r\nof man, thou stern king, having eaten of it as a dainty morsel, and sent\r\nit as a mess to thy friends.\" Such is the kind of jokes they enjoy; the\r\npoet describes the speech of the Queen as \"a word of mockery.\"[48] The\r\nexchange of mocking words between Loki and the gods is of the same order\r\nas Gudrun's speech. Cowards! cries Loki to the gods; Prostitutes! cries\r\nhe to the goddesses; Drunkard! is the reply of both. There is no\r\nquestion here of _argute loqui_.\r\n\r\nViolent in their speech, cruel in their actions,[49] they love all that\r\nis fantastic, prodigious, colossal; and this tendency appears even in\r\nthe writings where they wish to amuse; it is still more marked there\r\nthan in the ancient Celtic tales. Thor and the giant go a-fishing, the\r\ngiant puts two hooks on his line and catches two whales at once. Thor\r\nbaits his hook with an ox's head and draws out the great serpent which\r\nencircles the earth.[50]\r\n\r\nTheir violence and energy spend their force, and then the man, quite\r\nanother man it would seem, veers round; the once dauntless hero is now\r\ndaunted by shadows, by thoughts, by nothing. Those strong beings, who\r\nlaugh when their hearts are cut out alive, are the prey of vague\r\nthoughts. Already in that far-off time their world, which appears to us\r\nso young, seemed old to them. They were acquainted with causeless\r\nregrets, vain sorrows, and disgust of life. No literature has produced a\r\ngreater number of disconsolate poems. Mournful songs abound in the\r\n\"Corpus Poeticum\" of the North.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nWith beliefs, traditions, and ideas of the same sort, the Anglo-Saxons\r\nhad landed in Britain and settled there.[51] Established in their\r\n\"isolated dwellings,\" if they leave them it is for action; if they\r\nre-enter them it is for solitary reverie, or sometimes for orgies. The\r\nmain part of their original literature, like that of their brothers and\r\ncousins on the Continent, consists of triumphal songs and heartrending\r\nlaments. It is contemplative and warlike.[52]\r\n\r\nThey have to fight against their neighbours, or against their kin from\r\nover the sea, who in their turn wish to seize upon the island. The\r\nwar-song remains persistently in favour with them, and preserves, almost\r\nintact, its characteristics of haughty pride and ferocity. Its cruel\r\naccents recur even in the pious poems written after the conversion, and\r\nin the middle of the monotonous tale told by the national annalist. The\r\nAnglo-Saxon monk who draws up in his cell the chronicle of the events of\r\nthe year, feels his heart beat at the thought of a great victory, and in\r\nthe midst of the placid prose which serves to register eclipses of the\r\nmoon and murders of kings, he suddenly inserts the bounding verse of an\r\nenthusiastic war-song:\r\n\r\n\"This year, King AEthelstan, lord of earls, ring-giver of warriors, and\r\nhis brother eke Edmund AEtheling, life-long glory in battle won at\r\nBrunanburh.... The foes lay low, the Scots people and the shipman\r\ndeath-doomed fell. The field streamed with warriors' blood what time the\r\nsun up, at morning-tide the glorious star, glided o'er grounds, God's\r\ncandle bright the eternal Lord's, until the noble creature sank to its\r\nsetting.\"\r\n\r\nThe poet describes the enemy's defeat and flight, the slaughter that\r\nensues, and with cries of joy calls upon the flocks of wild birds, the\r\n\"swart raven with horned neb,\" and \"him of goodly coat, the eagle,\" and\r\nthe \"greedy war hawk,\" to come and share the carcases. Never was so\r\nsplendid a slaughter seen, \"from what books tell us, old chroniclers,\r\nsince hither from the east Angles and Saxons ('Engle and Seaxe'), came\r\nto land, o'er the broad seas, Britain ('Brytene') sought, proud\r\nwar-smiths, the Welsh ('Wealas') o'ercame, men for glory eager, the\r\ncountry gain'd.\"[53]\r\n\r\nThe writer's heart swells with delight at the thought of so many\r\ncorpses, of so great a carnage and so much gore; he is happy and\r\ntriumphant, he dwells complacently on the sight, as poets of another day\r\nand country would dwell on the thought of paths \"where the wind swept\r\nroses\" (ou le vent balaya des roses).\r\n\r\nThese strong men lend themselves willingly, as do their kin over the\r\nsea, to the ebb and flow of powerful contrary feelings, and rush body\r\nand soul from the extreme of joy to the acme of sorrow. The mild\r\n_serenite_, enjoyed by men with classical tendencies was to them\r\nunknown, and the word was one which no Norman Conquest, no Angevin rule,\r\nno \"Augustan\" imitation, could force into the language; it was unwanted,\r\nfor the thing was unknown. But they listen with unabated pleasure, late\r\nin the period, to the story of heroic deeds performed on the Continent\r\nby men of their own race, whose mind was shaped like theirs, and who\r\nfelt the same feelings. The same blood and soul sympathy which animates\r\nthem towards their own King AEthelstan, lord of earls, ring-giver of\r\nwarriors--not a myth that one, not a fable his deeds--warms the songs\r\nthey devote to King Waldhere of Aquitaine, to the Scandinavian warrior\r\nBeowulf, and to others, probably, who belonged to the same Germanic\r\nstock. Not a word of England or the Angles is said in those poems; still\r\nthey were popular in England. The Waldhere song, of which some sixty\r\nlines have been preserved, on two vellum leaves discovered in the\r\nbinding of an old book, told the story of the hero's flight from\r\nAttila's Court with his bride Hildgund and a treasure (treasures play a\r\ngreat part in those epics), and of his successive fights with Gunther\r\nand Hagen while crossing the Vosges. These warriors, after this one\r\nappearance, vanish altogether from English literature, but their\r\nliterary life was continued on the Continent; their fate was told in\r\nLatin in the tenth century by a monk of St. Gall, and again they had a\r\npart to play in the German \"Nibelungenlied.\" Beowulf, on the contrary,\r\nScandinavian as he was, is known only through the Anglo-Saxon poet. In\r\n\"Beowulf,\" as in \"Waldhere,\" feelings, speeches, manners, ideal of life\r\nare the same as with the heroes of the \"Corpus Poeticum Boreale.\" The\r\nwhole obviously belongs to the same group of nations.[54]\r\n\r\nThe strange poem of \"Beowulf,\"[55] the most important monument of\r\nAnglo-Saxon literature, was discovered at the end of the last century,\r\nin a manuscript written about the year 1000,[56] and is now preserved in\r\nthe British Museum. Few works have been more discussed; it has been the\r\ncause of literary wars, in which the learned men of England, Denmark,\r\nSweden, Germany, France, and America have taken part; and peace is not\r\nyet signed.\r\n\r\nThis poem, like the old Celtic tales, is a medley of pagan legends,\r\nwhich did not originally concern Beowulf in particular,[57] and of\r\nhistorical facts, the various parts, after a separate literary life,\r\nhaving been put together, perhaps in the eighth century, perhaps later,\r\nby an Anglo-Saxon Christian, who added new discrepancies in trying to\r\nadapt the old tale to the faith of his day. No need to expatiate on the\r\nincoherence of a poem formed of such elements. Its heroes are at once\r\npagan and Christian; they believe in Christ and in Weland; they fight\r\nagainst the monsters of Scandinavian mythology, and see in them the\r\ndescendants of Cain; historical facts, such as a battle of the sixth\r\ncentury, mentioned by Gregory of Tours, where the victory remained to\r\nthe Frankish ancestor,[58] are mixed up with tales of fantastic duels\r\nbelow the waves.\r\n\r\nAccording to a legend partly reproduced in the poem, the Danes had no\r\nchief. They beheld one day a small ship on the sea, and in it a child,\r\nand with him one of those ever-recurring treasures. They saw in this\r\nmysterious gift a sign from above, and took the child for their ruler;\r\n\"and he was a good king.\" When that king, Scyld, died, they placed him\r\nonce more on a bark with treasures, and the waters bore him away, no one\r\never knew whither.\r\n\r\nOne of his successors, Hrothgar,[59] who held his court, like the Danish\r\nkings of to-day, in the isle of Seeland, built in his old age a splendid\r\nhall, Heorot, wherein to feast his warriors and distribute rings among\r\nthem. They drank merrily there, while the singer sang \"from far-off ages\r\nthe origin of men.\" But there was a monster named Grendel, who lived in\r\nthe darkness of lonely morasses. He \"bore impatiently for a season to\r\nhear each day joyous revelry loud-sounding in the hall, where was the\r\nmusic of the harp, and the clear piercing song\" of the \"scop.\" When\r\nnight came, the fiend \"went to visit the grand house, to see how the\r\nRing-Danes after the beer-drinking had settled themselves in it. Then\r\nfound he therein a crowd of nobles (aethelinga) asleep after the feast;\r\nthey knew no care.\"[60] Grendel removed thirty of them to his lair, and\r\nthey were killed by \"that dark pest of men, that mischief-working\r\nbeing, grim and greedy, savage and fierce.\" Grendel came again and\r\n\"wrought a yet worse deed of murder.\" The thanes ceased to care much for\r\nthe music and glee of Heorot. \"He that escaped from that enemy kept\r\nhimself ever afterwards far off in greater watchfulness.\"\r\n\r\nHigelac, king of the Geatas (who the Geatas were is doubtful; perhaps\r\nGoths of Gothland in Sweden, perhaps Jutes of Jutland[61]), had a\r\nnephew, Beowulf, son of Ecgtheow, of the royal Swedish blood, who heard\r\nof the scourge. Beowulf went with his companions on board a ship; \"the\r\nfoamy-necked cruiser, hurried on by the wind, flew over the sea, most\r\nlike to a bird,\" and followed \"the path of the swans.\" For the North Sea\r\nis the path of the swans as well as of the whales, and the wild swan\r\nabounds to this day on the coasts of Norway.[62] Beowulf landed on the\r\nDanish shore, and proposed to Hrothgar to rid him of the monster.\r\n\r\nHrothgar does not conceal from his guests the terrible danger they are\r\nrunning: \"Often have boasted the sons of battle, drunken with beer, over\r\ntheir cups of ale, that they would await in the beer-hall, with their\r\ndeadly sharp-edged swords, the onset of Grendel. Then in the morning,\r\nwhen the daylight came, this mead-hall, this lordly chamber, was stained\r\nwith gore, all the bench-floor drenched in blood, the hall in\r\ncarnage....\" The Geatas persist in their undertaking, and they are\r\nfeasted by their host: \"Then was a bench cleared for the sons of the\r\nGeatas, to sit close together in the beer-hall; there the stout-hearted\r\nones went and sat, exulting clamorously. A thane attended to their\r\nwants, who carried in his hands a chased ale-flagon, and poured the\r\npure bright liquor.\"\r\n\r\nNight falls; the Geat and his companions remain in the hall and \"bow\r\nthemselves to repose.\" Grendel the \"night walker came prowling in the\r\ngloom of night ... from his eyes there issued a hideous light, most like\r\nto fire. In the hall he saw many warriors, a kindred band, sleeping all\r\ntogether, a group of clansmen. Then he laughed in his heart.\" He did not\r\ntarry, but seized one of the sleepers, \"tore him irresistibly, bit his\r\nflesh, drank the blood from his veins, swallowed him by large morsels;\r\nsoon had he devoured all the corpse but the feet and hands.\" He then\r\nfinds himself confronted by Beowulf. The fight begins under the sounding\r\nroof, the gilded seats are overthrown, and it was a wonder the hall\r\nitself did not fall in; but it was \"made fast with iron bands.\" At last\r\nGrendel's arm is wrenched off, and he flees towards his morasses to die.\r\n\r\nWhile Beowulf, loaded with treasure, returns to his own country, another\r\nscourge appears. The mother of Grendel wishes to avenge him, and, during\r\nthe night, seizes and eats Hrothgar's favourite warrior. Beowulf comes\r\nback and reaches the cave of the fiends under the waters; the fight is\r\nan awful one, and the hero was about to succumb, when he caught sight of\r\nan enormous sword forged by the giants. With it he slays the foe; and\r\nalso cuts off the head of Grendel, whose body lay there lifeless. At the\r\ncontact of this poisonous blood the blade melts entirely, \"just like\r\nice, when the Father looseneth the bonds of frost, unwindeth the ropes\r\nthat bind the waves.\"\r\n\r\nLater, after having taken part in the historic battle fought against the\r\nFranks, in which his uncle Higelac was killed, Beowulf becomes king, and\r\nreigns fifty years. In his old age, he has to fight for the last time, a\r\nmonster, \"a fierce Fire-drake,\" that held a treasure. He is victorious;\r\nbut sits down wounded on a stone, feeling that he is about to die. \"Now\r\ngo thou quickly, dear Wiglaf,\" he says to the only one of his companions\r\nwho had come to his rescue, \"to spy out the hoard under the hoar rock;\r\n... make haste now that I may examine the ancient wealth, the golden\r\nstore, may closely survey the brilliant cunningly-wrought gems, that so\r\nI may the more tranquilly, after seeing the treasured wealth, quit my\r\nlife, and my country, which I have governed long.\" Bowls and dishes, a\r\nsword \"shot with brass,\" a standard \"all gilded, ... locked by strong\r\nspells,\" from which issued \"a ray of light,\" are brought to him. He\r\nenjoys the sight; and here, out of love for his hero, the Christian\r\ncompiler of the story, after having allowed him to satisfy so much of\r\nhis heathen tastes, prepares him for heaven, and makes him utter words\r\nof gratitude to \"the Lord of all, the King of glory, the eternal Lord\";\r\nwhich done, Beowulf, a heathen again, is permitted to order for himself\r\nsuch a funeral as the Geatas of old were accustomed to: \"Rear a mound,\r\nconspicuous after the burning, at the headland which juts into the sea.\r\nThat shall, to keep my people in mind, tower up on Hrones-ness, that\r\nseafaring men may afterwards call it Beowulf's Mound, they who drive\r\nfrom far their roaring vessels over the mists of the floods.\" Wiglaf\r\nvainly tries to revive him with water; and addressing his unworthy\r\ncompanions, who then only dare to come out of the wood, expresses gloomy\r\nforebodings as to the future of his country: \"Now may the people expect\r\na time of strife, as soon as the king's fall shall become widely known\r\nto the Franks and Frisians.... To us never after [the quarrel in which\r\nHigelac died] was granted the favour of the Merovingians\r\n(_Mere-Wioinga_). Nor do I expect at all any peace or faith from the\r\nSwedish people....\" The serpent is thrown \"over the wall-cliff; they let\r\nthe waves take, the flood close upon, the keeper of the treasures.\" A\r\nmound is built on the hill, \"widely visible to seafaring men.... They\r\nplaced on the barrow rings and jewels, ... they let the earth hold the\r\ntreasure of earls, the gold in the sand where it now yet remaineth, as\r\nuseless to men as it [formerly] was.\"[63] They ride about the mound,\r\nrecounting in their chants the deeds of the dead: \"So mourned the people\r\nof the Geatas, his hearth-companions, for their lord's fall; said that\r\nhe was among world-kings the mildest and the kindest of men, most\r\ngracious to his people and most desirous of praise.\"\r\n\r\nThe ideal of a happy life has somewhat changed since the days of\r\nBeowulf. Then, as we see, happiness consisted in the satisfaction of\r\nvery simple and primitive tastes, in fighting well, and after the fight\r\neating and drinking heartily, and listening to songs and music, and\r\nafter the music enjoying a sound sleep. The possession of many rings,\r\nhandsome weapons and treasure, was also indispensable to make up\r\ncomplete happiness; so much so that, out of respect towards the chief,\r\nsome of his rings and jewels were buried with him, \"useless to men,\" as\r\nthe author of \"Beowulf\" says, not without a touch of regret. Such was\r\nthe existence led by those companions of Hrothgar, who are described as\r\nenjoying the happiest of lives before the appearance of Grendel, and who\r\n\"knew no care.\" All that is tender, and would most arouse the\r\nsensibility of the sensitive men of to-day, is considered childish, and\r\nawakes no echo: \"Better it is for every one that he should avenge his\r\nfriend than that he should mourn exceedingly,\" says Beowulf; very\r\ndifferent from Roland, the hero of France, he too of Germanic origin,\r\nbut living in a different _milieu_, where his soul has been softened.\r\n\"When Earl Roland saw that his peers lay dead, and Oliver too, whom he\r\nso dearly loved, his heart melted; he began to weep; colour left his\r\nface.\"\r\n\r\n    Li cons Rodlanz, quant il veit morz ses pers\r\n    Ed Olivier qu'il tant podeit amer,\r\n    Tendror en out, commencet a plorer,\r\n    En son visage fut molt descolorez.[64]\r\n\r\nBeowulf crushes all he touches; in his fights he upsets monsters, in his\r\ntalks he tumbles his interlocutors headlong. His retorts have nothing\r\nwinged about them; he does not use the feathered arrow, but the iron\r\nhammer. Hunferth taunts him with not having had the best in a swimming\r\nmatch. Beowulf replies by a strong speech, which can be summed up in few\r\nwords: liar, drunkard, coward, murderer! It seems an echo from the\r\nbanqueting hall of the Scandinavian gods; in the same manner Loki and\r\nthe goddesses played with words. For the assembled warriors of\r\nHrothgar's court Beowulf goes in nowise beyond bounds; they are not\r\nindignant, they would rather laugh. So did the gods.\r\n\r\nLandscape painting in the Anglo-Saxon poems is adapted to men of this\r\nstamp. Their souls delight in the bleak boreal climes, the north wind,\r\nfrost, hail, ice, howling tempest and raging seas, recur as often in\r\nthis literature as blue waves and sunlit blossoms in the writings of men\r\nto whom these exquisite marvels are familiar. Their descriptions are all\r\nshort, save when they refer to ice or snow, or the surge of the sea. The\r\nAnglo-Saxon poets dwell on such sights complacently; their tongue then\r\nis loosened. In \"Beowulf,\" the longest and truest description is that of\r\nthe abode of the monsters: \"They inhabit the dark land, wolf-haunted\r\nslopes, windy headlands, the rough fen-way, where the mountain stream,\r\nunder the dark shade of the headlands, runneth down, water under land.\r\nIt is not far from hence, a mile by measure, that the mere lies; over it\r\nhang groves of [rimy] trees, a wood fast-rooted, [and] bend shelteringly\r\nover the water; there every night may [one] see a dire portent, fire on\r\nthe flood. No one of the sons of men is so experienced as to know those\r\nlake-depths. Though the heath-ranging hart, with strong horns, pressed\r\nhard by the hounds, seek that wooded holt, hunted from far, he will\r\nsooner give up his life, his last breath on the bank, before he will\r\n[hide] his head therein. It is not a holy place. Thence the turbid wave\r\nriseth up dark-hued to the clouds, when the wind stirreth up foul\r\nweather, until the air grows gloomy, the heavens weep.\"\r\n\r\nThe same unchanging genius manifests itself in the national epic, in the\r\nshorter songs, and even in the prose chronicles of the Anglo-Saxons. To\r\ntheir excessive enthusiasms succeed periods of complete depression;\r\ntheir orgies are followed by despair; they sacrifice their life in\r\nbattle without a frown, and yet, when the hour for thought has come,\r\nthey are harassed by the idea of death. Their national religion foresaw\r\nthe end of the world and of all things, and of the gods even. Listen,\r\nonce more, to the well-known words of one of them:\r\n\r\n\"Human life reminds me of the gatherings thou holdest with thy\r\ncompanions in winter, around the fire lighted in the middle of the hall.\r\nIt is warm in the hall, and outside howls the tempest with its\r\nwhirlwinds of rain and snow. Let a sparrow enter by one door, and,\r\ncrossing the hall, escape by another. While he passes through, he is\r\nsheltered from the wintry storm; but this moment of peace is brief.\r\nEmerging from the cold, in an instant he disappears from sight, and\r\nreturns to the cold again. Such is the life of man; we behold it for a\r\nshort time, but what has preceded and what is to follow, we know\r\nnot....\"[65]\r\n\r\nWould not Hamlet have spoken thus, or Claudio?\r\n\r\n    Ay, to die and go we know not where;\r\n    To lie in cold obstruction....\r\n\r\nThus spoke, nine centuries before them, an Anglo-Saxon chief who had\r\narisen in the council of King Eduini and advised him, according to Bede,\r\nto adopt the religion of the monks from Rome, because it solved the\r\nfearful problem. In spite of years and change, this anxiety did not die\r\nout; it was felt by the Puritans, and Bunyan, and Dr. Johnson, and the\r\npoet Cowper.\r\n\r\nAnother view of the problem was held by races imbued with classical\r\nideas, the French and others; classical equanimity influenced them. Let\r\nus not poison our lives by the idea of death, they used to think, at\r\nleast before this century; there is a time for all things, and it will\r\nbe enough to remember death when its hour strikes. \"Mademoiselle,\" said\r\nLa Mousse to the future Madame de Grignan, too careful of her beautiful\r\nhands, \"all that will decay.\" \"Yes, but it is not decayed yet,\" answered\r\nMademoiselle de Sevigne, summing up in a single word the philosophy of\r\nmany French lives. We will sorrow to-morrow, if need be, and even then,\r\nif possible, without darkening our neighbours' day with any grief of\r\nours. Let us retire from life, as from a drawing-room, discreetly, \"as\r\nfrom a banquet,\" said La Fontaine.[66] And this good grace, which is not\r\nindifference, but which little resembles the anguish and enthusiasms of\r\nthe North, is also in its way the mark of strong minds. For they were\r\nnot made of insignificant beings, those generations who went to battle\r\nand left the world without a sneer or a tear; with ribbons on the\r\nshoulder and a smile on the lips.[67]\r\n\r\nExamples of Anglo-Saxon poems, either dreamy or warlike, could easily be\r\nmultiplied. We have the lamentations of the man without a country, of\r\nthe friendless wanderer, of the forlorn wife, of the patronless singer,\r\nof the wave-tossed mariner; and these laments are always associated with\r\nthe grand Northern landscapes of which little had been made in ancient\r\nliteratures:\r\n\r\n\"That the man knows not, to whom on land all falls out most joyfully,\r\nhow I, miserable and sad on the ice-cold sea, a winter pass'd, with\r\nexile traces ... of dear kindred bereft, hung o'er with icicles, the\r\nhail in showers flew; where I heard nought save the sea roaring, the\r\nice-cold wave. At times the swan's song I made to me for pastime ...\r\nnight's shadow darken'd, from the north it snow'd, frost bound the land,\r\nhail fell on the earth, coldest of grain....\" Or, in another song:\r\n\"Then wakes again the friendless mortal, sees before him fallow ways,\r\nocean fowls bathing, spreading their wings, rime and snow descending\r\nwith hail mingled; then are the heavier his wounds of heart.\"[68]\r\n\r\nThere are descriptions of dawn in new and unexpected terms: \"The guest\r\nslept within until the black raven, blithe-hearted, gave warning of the\r\ncoming of the heaven's joy, the bright sun, and of robbers fleeing\r\naway.\"[69] Never did the terraces of Rome, the peristyles of Athens, the\r\nbalconies of Verona, see mornings dawn like unto these, to the raven's\r\nmerry shriek. The sea of the Anglo-Saxons is not the Mediterranean,\r\nwashing with its blue waves the marble walls of villas; it is the North\r\nSea, with its grey billows, bordered by barren shores and chalky cliffs.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[40] H.

See H. L. D. Ward, \"Catalogue of Romances in\r\nthe British Museum,\" vol. ii. 1893, pp. 6 ff.\r\n\r\n[59] According to the poem, the line of succession was: Scyld, Beowulf\r\n(not our hero), Healfdene, Heorogar, Hrothgar.\r\n\r\n[60] \"Beowulf,\" 1876, T.

To the Germanic pirates established in the isle of\r\nBritain, he brought a strange teaching. The ideas he tried to spread\r\nhave become so familiar to us, we can hardly realise the amazement they\r\nmust have caused. To these fearless warriors who won kingdoms at the\r\npoint of their spears, and by means of their spears too won their way\r\ninto Walhalla, who counted on dying one day, not in their beds, but in\r\nbattle, so that the Valkyrias, \"choosers of the slain,\" might carry them\r\nto heaven on their white steeds, to these men came a foreign monk, and\r\nsaid: Be kind; worship the God of the weak, who, unlike Woden, will\r\nreward thee not for thy valour, but for thy mercy.\r\n\r\nSuch was the seed that Rome, ever life-giving, now endeavoured to sow\r\namong triumphant sea-rovers. The notion of the State and the notion of\r\nthe Church both rose out of the ruins of the Eternal City; ideas equally\r\npowerful, but almost contradictory, which were only to be reconciled\r\nafter centuries of confusion, and alternate periods of violence and\r\ndepression. The princes able to foresee the necessary fusion of these\r\ntwo ideas, and who made attempts, however rude, to bring it about were\r\nrare, and have remained for ever famous: Charlemagne in France and\r\nAlfred the Great in England.\r\n\r\nThe miracle of conversion was accomplished in the isle, as it had been\r\non the Continent. Augustine baptized King AEthelberht, and celebrated\r\nmass in the old Roman church of St. Martin of Canterbury. The religion\r\nfounded by the Child of Bethlehem conquered the savage Saxons, as it had\r\nconquered the debauched Romans; the difficulty and the success were\r\nequal in both cases. In the Germanic as in the Latin country, the new\r\nreligion had to stem the stream; the Romans of the decadence and the men\r\nof the North differed in their passions, but resembled each other in the\r\nimpetuosity with which they followed the lead of their instincts. To\r\nboth, the apostle came and whispered: Curb thy passions, be hard upon\r\nthyself and merciful to others; blessed are the simple, blessed are the\r\npoor; as thou forgivest so shalt thou be forgiven; thou shalt not\r\ndespise the weak, thou shalt _love_ him! And this unexpected murmur was\r\nheard each day, like a counsel and a threat, in the words of the morning\r\nprayer, in the sound of the bells, in the music of pious chants.\r\n\r\nThe conversion was at first superficial, and limited to outward\r\npractices; the warrior bent the knee, but his heart remained the same.\r\nThe spirit of the new religion could not as yet penetrate his soul; he\r\nremained doubtful between old manners and new beliefs, and after fits of\r\nrepentance and relapses into savagery, the converted chieftain finally\r\nleft this world better prepared for Walhalla than for Paradise. Those\r\nwho witnessed his death realised it themselves. When Theodoric the Great\r\ndied in his palace at Ravenna, piously and surrounded by priests, Woden\r\nwas seen, actually seen, bearing away the prince's soul to Walhalla.\r\n\r\nThe new converts of Great Britain understood the religion of Christ much\r\nas they had understood that of Thor. Only a short distance divided man\r\nfrom godhood in heathen times; the god had his passions and his\r\nadventures, he was intrepid, and fought even better than his people. For\r\na long time, as will happen with neophytes, the new Christians continued\r\nto seek around them the human god who had disappeared in immensity, they\r\naddressed themselves to him as they had formerly done to the deified\r\nheroes, who, having shared their troubles, must needs sympathise with\r\ntheir sorrows. For a long time, contradictory faiths were held side by\r\nside. Christ was believed in, but Woden was still feared, and secretly\r\nappeased by sacrifices. Kings are obliged to publish edicts, forbidding\r\ntheir subjects to believe in the ancient divinities, whom they now term\r\n\"demons\"; but that does not prevent the monks who compile the\r\n\"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" from tracing back the descent of their princes\r\nto Woden: if it is not deifying, it is at least ennobling them.[70]\r\n\r\nBe your obedience qualified by reason, St. Paul had said. That of the\r\nAnglo-Saxons was not so qualified. On the contrary, they believed out of\r\nobedience, militarily. Following the prince's lead, all his subjects are\r\nconverted; the prince goes back to heathendom; all his people become\r\nheathens again. From year to year, however, the new religion\r\nprogresses, while the old is waning; this phenomenon is brought about,\r\nin the south, by the influence of Augustine and the monks from Rome; and\r\nin the north, owing mainly to Celtic monks from the monastery of Iona,\r\nfounded in the sixth century by St. Columba, on the model of the\r\nconvents of Ireland. About the middle of the seventh century the work is\r\nnearly accomplished; the old churches abandoned by the Romans have been\r\nrestored; many others are built; one of them still exists at\r\nBradford-on-Avon in a perfect state of preservation[71]; monasteries are\r\nfounded, centres of culture and learning. Some of the rude princes who\r\nreign in the country set great examples of devotion to Christ and\r\nsubmission to the Roman pontiff. They date their charters from the\r\n\"reign of our Lord Jesus Christ, reigning for ever.\"[72] The Princess\r\nHilda founds, in the seventh century, the monastery of Streoneshalch,\r\nand becomes its abbess; Ceadwalla dies at Rome in 689, and is buried in\r\nSt. Peter's, under the _Porticus Pontificum_, opposite the tomb of St.\r\nGregory the Great.[73] AEthelwulf, king of the West Saxons, goes also on\r\na pilgrimage to Rome \"in great state, and remains twelve months, after\r\nwhich he returns home; and then Charles, king of the Franks, gave him\r\nhis daughter in marriage.\"[74] He sends his son Alfred to the Eternal\r\nCity; and the Pope takes a liking to the young prince, who was to be\r\nAlfred the Great.\r\n\r\nThe notion of moderation and measure is unknown to these enthusiasts,\r\nwho easily fall into despair. In the following period, after the Norman\r\nConquest, when manners and customs were beginning to change, the\r\nchronicler, William of Malmesbury, trying to draw a correct picture of\r\nthe ancient owners of the land, is struck by the exaggerations of the\r\nSaxons' temperament. Great numbers of them are drunkards, they lead\r\ndissolute lives, and reign as ferocious tyrants; great numbers of them,\r\ntoo, are pious, devout, faithful even unto martyrdom: \"What shall I say\r\nof so many bishops, hermits, and abbots? The island is rendered famous\r\nby the relics of native saints, so numerous that it is impossible to\r\nvisit a borough of any importance without hearing the name of a new\r\nsaint. Yet the memory of many has vanished, for lack of writers to\r\npreserve it!\"[75]\r\n\r\nThe taste for proselytism, of which the race has since given so many\r\nproofs, is early manifested. Once converted, the Anglo-Saxons produce\r\nmissionaries, who in their turn carry the glad tidings to their pagan\r\nbrothers on the Continent, and become saints of the Roman Church. St.\r\nWilfrith leaves Northumberland about 680, and goes to preach the Gospel\r\nto the Frisians; St. Willibrord starts from England about 690, and\r\nsettles among the Frisians and Danes[76]; Winfrith, otherwise called St.\r\nBoniface (an approximate translation of his name), sojourns in Thuringia\r\nand Bavaria, \"sowing,\" as he says, \"the evangelical seed among the rude\r\nand ignorant tribes of Germany.\"[77] He reorganises the Church of the\r\nFranks, and dies martyrised by the Frisians in 755. Scarcely is the\r\nhive formed when it begins to swarm. The same thing happened with all\r\nthe sects created later in the English land.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nWith religion had come Latin letters. Those same Anglo-Saxons, whose\r\nliterature at the time of their invasion consisted in the songs\r\nmentioned by Tacitus, \"carmina antiqua,\" which they trusted to memory\r\nalone, who compiled no books and who for written monuments had Runic\r\ninscriptions graven on utensils or on commemorative stones, now have, in\r\ntheir turn, monks who compose chronicles, and kings who know Latin.\r\nLibraries are formed in the monasteries; schools are attached to them;\r\nmanuscripts are there copied and illuminated in beautiful caligraphy and\r\nsplendid colours. The volutes and knots with which the worshippers of\r\nWoden ornamented their fibulae, their arms, the prows of their ships, are\r\nreproduced in purple and azure, in the initials of the Gospels. The use\r\nmade of them is different, the taste remains the same.\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Saxon missionaries and learned men correspond with each other\r\nin the language of Rome. Boniface, in the wilds of Germany, remains in\r\nconstant communication with the prelates and monks of England; he begs\r\nfor books, asks for and gives advice; his letters have come down to us,\r\nand are in Latin. Ealhwine or Alcuin, of York, called by Charlemagne to\r\nhis court, freely bestows, in Latin letters, good advice on his\r\ncountrymen. He organises around the great Emperor a literary academy,\r\nwhere each bears an assumed name; Charlemagne has taken that of David,\r\nhis chamberlain has chosen that of Tyrcis, and Alcuin that of Horatius\r\nFlaccus. In this \"hotel de Rambouillet\" of the Karlings, the affected\r\nstyle was as much relished as at the fair Arthenice's, and Alcuin, in\r\nhis barbarous Latin, has a studied elegance that might vie with the\r\nconceits of Voiture.[78]\r\n\r\nAldhelm (or Ealdhelm, d. 709) writes a treatise on Latin prosody, and,\r\nadding example to precept, composes riddles and a Eulogy of Virgins in\r\nLatin verse.[79] AEddi (Eddius Stephanus) writes a life, also in Latin,\r\nof his friend St. Wilfrith.[80]\r\n\r\nThe history of the nation had never been written. On the Continent, and\r\nfor a time in the island, rough war-songs were the only annals of the\r\nAnglo-Saxons. Now they have Latin chronicles, a Latin which Tacitus\r\nmight have smiled at, but which he would have understood. Above all,\r\nthey have the work of the Venerable Bede (Baeda), the most important\r\nLatin monument of all the Anglo-Saxon period.\r\n\r\nBede was born in Northumbria, about 673, the time when the final\r\nconversion of England was being accomplished. He early entered the\r\nBenedictine monastery of Jarrow, and remained there till his death. It\r\nwas a recently founded convent, established by Benedict Biscop, who had\r\nenriched it with books brought back from his journeys to Rome. In this\r\nretreat, on the threshold of which worldly sounds expired, screened from\r\nsorrows, surrounded by disciples who called him \"dear master, beloved\r\nfather,\" Bede allowed the years of his life to glide on, his sole\r\nambition being to learn and teach.\r\n\r\nThe peaceful calm of this sheltered existence, which came to an end\r\nbefore the time of the Danish invasions, is reflected in the writings of\r\nBede. He left a great number of works: interpretations of the Gospels,\r\nhomilies, letters, lives of saints, works on astronomy, a \"De Natura\r\nRerum\" where he treats of the elements, of comets, of winds, of the\r\nNile, of the Red Sea, of Etna; a \"De Temporibus,\" devoted to\r\nbissextiles, to months, to the week, to the solstice; a \"De Temporum\r\nRatione\" on the months of the Greeks, Romans, and Angles, the moon and\r\nits power, the epact, Easter, &c. He wrote hymns in Latin verse, and a\r\nlife of St. Cuthberht; lastly, and above all, he compiled in Latin\r\nprose, a \"Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum,\"[81] which has\r\nremained the basis of all the histories composed after his. In it Bede\r\nshows himself as he was: honest, sincere, sedate, and conscientious. He\r\nquotes his authorities which are, for the description of the island and\r\nfor the most ancient period of his history, Pliny, Solinus, Eutropius,\r\nOrosius, Gildas. From the advent of Augustine his work becomes his own;\r\nhe collects documents, memoranda, testimonies, frequently legends, and\r\npublishes the whole without any criticism, but without falsifications.\r\nHe lacks art, but not straightforwardness.\r\n\r\nLatinist though he was, he did not despise the national literature in\r\nspite of its ruggedness. He realised it was truly a literature; he made\r\ntranslations in Anglo-Saxon, but they are lost; he was versed in the\r\nnational poetry, \"doctus in nostris carminibus,\" writes his pupil\r\nCuthberht,[82] who pictures him on his deathbed, muttering Anglo-Saxon\r\nverses. He felt the charm of the poetic genius of his nation, and for\r\nthat reason has preserved and naively related the episodes of Caedmon in\r\nhis stable,[83] and of the Saxon chief comparing human life to the\r\nsparrow flying across the banquet hall.\r\n\r\nBede died on the 27th of May, 735, leaving behind him such a renown for\r\nsanctity that his bones were the occasion for one of those pious thefts\r\ncommon in the Middle Ages. In the eleventh century a priest of Durham\r\nremoved them in order to place them in the cathedral of that town, where\r\nthey still remain. St. Boniface, on receiving the news of this death,\r\nfar away in Germany, begged his friends in England to send him the works\r\nof his compatriot; the homilies of Bede would assist him, he said, in\r\ncomposing his own, and his commentaries on the Scriptures would be \"a\r\nconsolation in his sorrows.\"[84]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nAnglo-Saxon monks now speak Latin; some, since the coming of Theodore of\r\nTarsus,[85] even know a little Greek; an Anglo-Saxon king sleeps at\r\nRome, under the portico of St. Peter's; Woden has left heaven; on the\r\nsoil convulsed by so many wars, the leading of peaceful, sheltered\r\nlives, entirely dedicated to study, has become possible: and such was\r\nthe case with Bede. Has the nation really changed, and do we find\r\nourselves already in the presence of men with a partly latinised genius,\r\nsuch men as the English were hereafter to be? Not yet. The heart and\r\nmind remain the same; the surface alone is modified, and that slightly.\r\nThe full infusion of the Latin element, which is to transform the\r\nAnglo-Saxons into English, will take place several centuries hence, and\r\nwill be the result of a last invasion. The genius of the Teutonic\r\ninvaders continues nearly intact, and nothing proves this more clearly\r\nthan the Christian poetry composed in the native tongue, and produced in\r\nBritain after the conversion. The same impetuosity, passion, and\r\nlyricism, the same magnificent apostrophes which gave its character to\r\nthe old pagan poetry are found again in Christian songs, as well as the\r\nsame recurring alternatives of deep melancholy and noisy exultation.\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Saxon poets describe the saints of the Gospel, and it seems as\r\nthough the companions of Beowulf stood again before us: \"So, we have\r\nlearned, in days of yore, of twelve beneath the stars, heroes gloriously\r\nblessed.\" These \"heroes,\" these \"warriors,\" are the twelve apostles. One\r\nof them, St. Andrew, arrives in an uninhabited country; not a desert in\r\nAsia, nor a solitude in Greece; it might be the abode of Grendel: \"Then\r\nwas the saint in the shadow of darkness, warrior hard of courage, the\r\nwhole night long with various thoughts beset; snow bound the earth with\r\nwinter-casts; cold grew the storms, with hard hail-showers; and rime and\r\nfrost, the hoary warriors, locked up the dwellings of men, the\r\nsettlements of the people; frozen were the lands with cold icicles,\r\nshrunk the water's might; over the river streams, the ice made a bridge,\r\na pale water road.\"[86]\r\n\r\nThey have accepted the religion of Rome; they believe in the God of\r\nMercy; they have faith in the apostles preaching the doctrine of love to\r\nthe world: peace on earth to men of good will! But that warlike race\r\nwould think it a want of respect to see in the apostles mere _pacifici_,\r\nand in the Anglo-Saxon poems they are constantly termed \"warriors.\"\r\n\r\nAt several different times these new Christians translated parts of the\r\nBible into verse, and the Bible became Anglo-Saxon, not only in\r\nlanguage, but in tone and feeling as well. The first attempt of this\r\nkind was made by that herdsman of the seventh century, named Caedmon,\r\nwhose history has been told by Bede. He was so little gifted by nature\r\nthat when he sat, on feast days, at one of those meals \"where the custom\r\nis that each should sing in turn, he would leave the table when he saw\r\nthe harp approaching and return to his dwelling,\" unable to find verses\r\nto sing like the others. One night, when the harp had thus put him to\r\nflight, he had, in the stable where he was keeping the cattle, a vision.\r\n\"Sing me something,\" was the command of a mysterious being. \"I cannot,\"\r\nhe answered, \"and the reason why I left the hall and retired here is\r\nthat I cannot sing.\" \"But sing thou must.\" \"What shall I sing, then?\"\r\n\"Sing the origin of things.\" Then came at once into his mind \"excellent\r\nverses\"; Bede translates a few of them, which are very flat, but he\r\ngenerously lays the fault on his own translation, saying: \"Verses, even\r\nthe very best, cannot be turned word for word from one language into\r\nanother without losing much of their beauty and dignity,\"[87] a remark\r\nwhich has stood true these many centuries. Taken to the abbess Hilda, of\r\nStreoneshalch, Caedmon roused the admiration of all, became a monk, and\r\ndied like a saint, \"and no one since, in the English race, has ever been\r\nable to compose pious poems equal to his, for he was inspired by God,\r\nand had learnt nothing of men.\" Some tried, however.\r\n\r\nAn incomplete translation of the Bible in Anglo-Saxon verses has come\r\ndown to us, the work apparently of several authors of different\r\nepochs.[88] Caedmon may be one of them: the question has been the cause\r\nof immense discussion, and remains doubtful.\r\n\r\nThe tone is haughty and peremptory in the impassioned parts; abrupt\r\nappositions keep the attention fixed upon the main quality of the\r\ncharacters, the one by which they are meant to live in memory;\r\ntriumphant accents accompany the tales of war; the dismal landscapes are\r\ndescribed with care, or rather with loving delight. Ethereal personages\r\nbecome in this popular Bible tangible realities. The fiend approaches\r\nParadise with the rude wiles of a peasant. Before starting he takes a\r\nhelmet, and fastens it tightly on his head. He presents himself to Adam\r\nas coming from God: \"The all-powerful above will not have trouble\r\nhimself, that on his journey he should come, the Lord of men, but he his\r\nvassal sendeth.\"[89]\r\n\r\nHell, the deluge, the corruption of the grave, the last judgment, the\r\ncataclysms of nature, are favourite subjects with these poets. Inward\r\nsorrows, gnawing thoughts that \"besiege\" men, doubts, remorse, gloomy\r\nlandscapes, all afford them abundant inspiration. Satan in his hell has\r\nfits of anguish and hatred, and the description of his tortures seems a\r\nrude draft of Milton's awful picture.\r\n\r\nCynewulf,[90] one of the few poets of the Anglo-Saxon period known by\r\nname, and the greatest of all, feels the pangs of despair; and then\r\nrises to ecstasies, moved by religious love; he speaks of his return to\r\nChrist with a passionate fervour, foreshadowing the great conversions of\r\nthe Puritan epoch. He ponders over his thoughts \"in the narrowness of\r\nnight ... I was stained with my deeds, bound by my sins, buffeted with\r\nsorrows, bitterly bound, with misery encompassed....\" Then the cross\r\nappears to him in the depths of heaven, surrounded by angels, sparkling\r\nwith jewels, flowing with blood. A sound breaks through the silence of\r\nthe firmament; life has been given to \"the best of trees,\" and it\r\nspeaks: \"It was long ago, yet I remember it, that I was cut down, at the\r\nend of a wood, stirred from my sleep.\" The cross is carried on the top\r\nof a mountain: \"Then the young hero made ready, that was Almighty\r\nGod.... I trembled when the champion embraced me.\"[91]\r\n\r\nThe poem in which St. Andrew figures as a \"warrior bold in war,\"\r\nattributed also to the same Cynewulf, is filled by the sound of the sea;\r\nall the sonorities of the ocean are heard, with the cadence and the\r\nvariety of the ancient Scandinavian sagas; a multitude of picturesque\r\nand living expressions designate a ship: \"Foamy-necked it fareth, likest\r\nunto a bird it glideth over ocean;\" it follows the path of the swans,\r\nand of the whales, borne by the ocean stream \"to the rolling of the\r\nwaters ... the clashing of the sea-streams ... the clash of the waves.\"\r\nThe sea of these poets, contrary to what Tacitus thought, was not a\r\nslumbering sea; it quivers, it foams, it sings.\r\n\r\nSt. Andrew decides to punish by a miracle the wild inhabitants of the\r\nland of Mermedonia. We behold, as in the Northern sagas, an impressive\r\nscene, and a fantastic landscape: \"He saw by the wall, wondrous fast\r\nupon the plain, mighty pillars, columns standing driven by the storm,\r\nthe antique works of giants....\r\n\r\n\"Hear thou, marble stone! by the command of God, before whose face all\r\ncreatures shall tremble, ... now let from thy foundation streams bubble\r\nout ... a rushing stream of water, for the destruction of men, a gushing\r\nocean!...\r\n\r\n\"The stone split open, the stream bubbled forth; it flowed over the\r\nground, the foaming billows at break of day covered the earth....\"\r\n\r\nThe sleeping warriors are awakened by this \"bitter service of beer.\"\r\nThey attempt to \"fly from the yellow stream, they would save their lives\r\nin mountain caverns\"; but an angel \"spread abroad over the town pale\r\nfire, hot warlike floods,\" and barred them the way; \"the waves waxed,\r\nthe torrents roared, fire-sparks flew aloft, the flood boiled with its\r\nwaves;\" on all sides were heard groans and the \"death-song.\"[92] Let us\r\nstop; but the poet continues; he is enraptured at the sight; no other\r\ndescription is so minutely drawn. Ariosto did not find a keener delight\r\nin describing with leisurely pen the bower of Alcina.\r\n\r\nThe religious poets of the Anglo-Saxons open the graves; the idea of\r\ndeath haunts them as much as it did their pagan ancestors; they look\r\nintently at the \"black creatures, grasping and greedy,\" and follow the\r\nprocess of decay to the end. They address the impious dead: \"It would\r\nhave been better for thee very much, ... that thou hadst been created a\r\nbird, or a fish in the sea, or like an ox upon the earth hadst found\r\nthy nurture going in the field, a brute without understanding; or in the\r\ndesert of wild beasts the worst, yea, though thou hadst been of serpents\r\nthe fiercest, then as God willed it, than thou ever on earth shouldst\r\nbecome a man, or ever baptism should receive\"[93]\r\n\r\n                This soul should fly from me,\r\n    And I be changed into some brutish beast\r\n    All beasts are happy, for when they die\r\n    Their souls are soon ditched in elements\r\n    O soul! be changed into small water drops,\r\n    And fall into the ocean; ne'er be found\r\n\r\nSo will, unknown to him, the very same thoughts be expressed by an\r\nEnglish poet of a later day.[94]\r\n\r\nDialogues are not rare in these poems, but they generally differ very\r\nmuch from the familiar dialogue of the Celts. They are mostly epic in\r\ncharacter, lyric in tone, with abrupt apostrophes causing the listener\r\nto start, like the sudden sound of a trumpet. When the idea is more\r\nfully developed the dialogue becomes a succession of discourses, full of\r\neloquence and power sometimes, but still discourses. We are equally far\r\nin both cases from the conversational style so frequent in the Irish\r\nstories.[95]\r\n\r\nThe devotional poetry of the Anglo-Saxons includes translations of the\r\nPsalms,[96] lives of saints, maxims, moral poems, and symbolic ones,\r\nwhere the supposed habits of animals are used to illustrate the duties\r\nof Christians. One of this latter sort has for its subject the whale\r\n\"full of guile,\" another the panther[97]; a third (incomplete) the\r\npartridge; a fourth, by a different hand, and evincing a very different\r\nsort of poetical taste, the phenix. This poem is the only one in the\r\nwhole range of Anglo-Saxon literature in which the warmth and hues of\r\nthe south are preserved and sympathetically described. It is a great\r\nchange to find a piece of some length with scarcely any frost in it, no\r\nstormy waves and north wind. The poet is himself struck by the\r\ndifference, and notices that it is not at all there \"as here with us,\"\r\nfor there \"nor hail nor rime on the land descend, nor windy cloud.\" In\r\nthe land of the phenix there is neither rain, nor cold, nor too great\r\nheat, nor steep mountains, nor wild dales; there are no cares, and no\r\nsorrows. But there the plains are evergreen, the trees always bear\r\nfruit, the plants are covered with flowers. It is the home of the\r\npeerless bird. His eyes turn to the sun when it rises in the east, and\r\nat night he \"looks earnestly when shall come up gliding from the east\r\nover the spacious sea, heaven's beam.\" He sings, and men never heard\r\nanything so exquisite. His note is more beautiful than the sound of the\r\nhuman voice, than that of trumpets and horns, than that of the harp,\r\nthan \"any of those sounds that the Lord has created for delight to men\r\nin this sad world.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he grows old, he flies to a desert place in Syria. Then, \"when the\r\nwind is still, the weather is fair, clear heaven's gem holy shines, the\r\nclouds are dispelled, the bodies of waters stand still, when every storm\r\nis lull'd under heaven, from the south shines nature's candle warm,\" the\r\nbird begins to build itself a nest in the branches, with forest leaves\r\nand sweet-smelling herbs. As the heat of the sun increases \"at summer's\r\ntide,\" the perfumed vapour of the plants rises, and the nest and bird\r\nare consumed. There remains something resembling a fruit, out of which\r\ncomes a worm, that develops into a bird with gorgeous wings. Thus man,\r\nin harvest-time, heaps grains in his dwelling, before \"frost and snow,\r\nwith their predominance earth deck, with winter weeds.\" From these seeds\r\nin springtime, as out of the ashes of the phenix, will come forth living\r\nthings, stalks bearing fruits, \"earth's treasures.\" Thus man, at the\r\nhour of death, renews his life, and receives at God's hands youth and\r\nendless joy.[98]\r\n\r\nThere are, doubtless, rays of light in Anglo-Saxon literature, which\r\nappear all the more brilliant for being surrounded by shadow; but this\r\nexample of a poem sunny throughout is unique. To find others, we must\r\nwait till Anglo-Saxon has become English literature.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nBesides their Latin writings and their devotional poems, the converted\r\nAnglo-Saxons produced many prose works in their national tongue.\r\nGermanic England greatly differed in this from Germanic France. In the\r\nlatter country the language of the Franks does not become acclimatised;\r\nthey see it themselves, and feel the impossibility of resisting; Latin\r\nas in general use, they have their national law written in Latin, _Lex\r\nSalica_. The popular speech, which will later become the French\r\nlanguage, is nothing but a Latin _patois_, and is not admitted to the\r\nhonour of being written. Notwithstanding all the care with which\r\narchives have been searched, no specimens of French prose have been\r\ndiscovered for the whole time corresponding to the Anglo-Saxon period\r\nsave one or two short fragments.[99] With the Anglo-Saxons, laws,[100]\r\nchronicles, and sermons for the common people were written in the\r\nnational tongue; and, as Latin was only understood by few, to these\r\nmonuments was added a series of translations.[101] The English country\r\ncan thus pride itself upon a literature which for antiquity is\r\nunparalleled in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe chief promoter of the art of prose was that Alfred (or Aelfred) whom\r\nPope Leo IV. had adopted as a spiritual son, and who reigned over the\r\nWest Saxons from 871 to 901. Between the death of Bede and the accession\r\nof Alfred, a great change had occurred in the island; towards the end of\r\nthe eighth century a new foe had appeared, the Scandinavian invader.\r\nStormy days have returned, the flood-gates have reopened; human torrents\r\nsweep the land, and each year spread further and destroy more. In vain\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon kings, and in France the successors of Charlemagne,\r\nannually purchase their departure, thus following the example of falling\r\nRome. The northern hordes come again in greater numbers, allured by the\r\nransoms, and they carry home such quantities of English coins that \"at\r\nthis day larger hoards of AEthelred the Second's coins have been found in\r\nthe Scandinavian countries than in our own, ... and the national museum\r\nat Stockholm is richer in this series than our own national\r\ncollection.\"[102] These men, termed Danes, Northmen, or Normans, by the\r\nAnglo-Saxon and French chroniclers, reappeared each year; then, like\r\nthe Germanic pirates of the fifth century, spared themselves the trouble\r\nof useless journeys, and remained in the proximity of plunder. They\r\nsettled first on the coasts, then in the interior. We find them\r\nestablished in France about the middle of the ninth century; in England\r\nthey winter in Thanet for the first time in 851, and after that do not\r\nleave the country. The small Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, alive only to local\r\ninterests, and unable to unite in a common resistance, are for them an\r\neasy prey. The Scandinavians move about at their ease, sacking London\r\nand the other towns. They renew their ravages at regular intervals, as\r\nmen would go fishing at the proper season.[103] They are designated\r\nthroughout the land by a terribly significant word: \"the Army.\" When the\r\nAnglo-Saxon chronicles make mention of \"the Army\" the northern vikings\r\nare always meant, not the defenders of the country. Monasteries are\r\nburnt by the invaders with no more remorse than if they were peasants'\r\nhuts; the vikings do not believe in Christ. Once more, and for the last\r\ntime, Woden has worshippers in Britain.\r\n\r\nHarassed by the Danes, having had to flee and disappear and hide\r\nhimself, Alfred, after a long period of reverses, resumed the contest\r\nwith a better chance, and succeeded in setting limits to the\r\nScandinavian incursions. England was divided in two parts, the north\r\nbelonging to the Danes, and the south to Alfred, with Winchester for his\r\ncapital.[104]\r\n\r\nIn the tumult caused by these new wars, what the\r\nSaxons had received of Roman culture had nearly all been swept away.\r\nBooks had been burnt, clerks had forgotten their Latin; the people were\r\nrelapsing by degrees into barbarism. Formerly, said Alfred, recalling to\r\nmind the time of Bede and Alcuin, \"foreigners came to this land in\r\nsearch of wisdom and instruction, and we should now have to get them\r\nfrom abroad if we wanted to have them.\" He does not believe there\r\nexisted south of the Thames, at the time of his accession, a single\r\nEnglishman \"able to translate a letter from Latin into English. When I\r\nconsidered all this, I remembered also how I saw, before it had been all\r\nravaged and burnt, how the churches throughout the whole of England\r\nstood filled with treasures and books, and there was also a great\r\nmultitude of God's servants, but they had very little knowledge of the\r\nbooks, for they could not understand anything of them, because they were\r\nnot written in their own language.\" It is a great wonder that men of the\r\npreceding generation, \"good and wise men who were formerly all over\r\nEngland,\" wrote no translation. There can be but one explanation: \"They\r\ndid not think that men would ever be so careless, and that learning\r\nwould so decay.\" Still the case is not absolutely hopeless, for there\r\nare many left who \"can read English writing.\" Remembering which, \"I\r\nbegan, among other various and manifold troubles of this kingdom, to\r\ntranslate into English the book which is called in Latin Pastoralis, and\r\nin English Shepherd's Book ('Hirdeboc'), sometimes word for word, and\r\nsometimes according to the sense, as I had learnt it from Plegmund my\r\narchbishop, and Asser my bishop, and Grimbold my mass-priest, and John\r\nmy mass-priest.\"[105] These learned men, and especially the Welshman\r\nAsser, who was to Alfred what Alcuin was to Charlemagne, helped him to\r\nspread learning by means of translations and by founding schools. They\r\nexplained to him the hard passages, to the best of their understanding,\r\nwhich it is true was not always perfect.\r\n\r\nBelonging to the Germanic race by his blood, and to the Latin realm by\r\nhis culture, keeping as much as he could the Roman ideal before his\r\neyes, Alfred evinced during all his life that composite genius, at once\r\npractical and passionate, which was to be, after the Norman Conquest,\r\nthe genius of the English people. He was thus an exceptional man, and\r\nshowed himself a real Englishman before the time. Forsaken by all, his\r\ndestruction being, as it seemed, a question of days, he does not yield;\r\nhe bides his time, and begins the fight again when the day has come. His\r\nsoul is at once noble and positive; he does not busy himself with\r\nlearning out of vanity or curiosity or for want of a pastime; he wishes\r\nto gather from books substantial benefits for his nation and himself. In\r\nhis wars he remembers the ancients, works upon their plans, and finds\r\nthat they answer well. He chooses, in order to translate them, books\r\nlikely to fill up the greatest gaps in the minds of his countrymen,\r\n\"some books which are most needful for all men to know,\"[106] the book\r\nof Orosius, which will be for them as a handbook of universal history;\r\nthe Ecclesiastical History of Bede, that will instruct them concerning\r\ntheir own past. He teaches laymen their duties with the \"Consolation\" of\r\nBoethius, and ecclesiastics with the Pastoral Rule of St. Gregory.[107]\r\n\r\nHis sole aim being to instruct, he does not hesitate to curtail his\r\nauthors when their discourses are useless or too long, to comment upon\r\nthem when obscure, to add passages when his own knowledge allows him. In\r\nhis translation of Bede, he sometimes contents himself with the titles\r\nof the chapters, suppressing the rest; in his Orosius he supplements the\r\ndescription of the world by details he has collected himself concerning\r\nthose regions of the North which had a national interest for his\r\ncompatriots. He notes down, as accurately as he can, the words of a\r\nScandinavian whom he had seen, and who had undertaken a voyage of\r\ndiscovery, the first journey towards the pole of which an account has\r\ncome down to us:\r\n\r\n\"Ohthere told his lord, king Alfred, that he dwelt northmost of all\r\nNorthmen. He said that he dwelt in the land to the northward, along the\r\nwest sea.[108] He said, however, that that land is very long north from\r\nthence, but it is all waste, except in a few places where the Fins here\r\nand there dwell, for hunting in the winter, and in the summer for\r\nfishing in that sea. He said that he was desirous to try, once on a\r\ntime, how far that country extended due north; or whether any one lived\r\nto the north of the waste. He then went due north, along the country,\r\nleaving all the way, the waste land on the right, and the wide sea on\r\nthe left, for three days: he was as far north as the whale-hunters go at\r\nthe farthest. Then he proceeded in his course due north as far as he\r\ncould sail within another three days. Then the land there inclined due\r\neast, or the sea into the land, he knew not which; but he knew that he\r\nthere waited for a west wind, or a little north, and sailed thence\r\neastward along that land, as far as he could sail in four days.\" He\r\narrives at a place where the land turns to the south, evidently\r\nsurrounding the White Sea, and he finds a broad river, doubtless the\r\nDwina, that he dares not cross on account of the hostility of the\r\ninhabitants. This was the first tribe he had come across since his\r\ndeparture; he had only seen here and there some Fins, hunters and\r\nfishers. \"He went thither chiefly, in addition to seeing the country, on\r\naccount of the walruses, because they have very noble bones in their\r\nteeth; some of those teeth they brought to the king; and their hides are\r\nvery good for ship ropes.\" Ohthere, adds Alfred, was very rich; he had\r\nsix hundred tame reindeer; he said the province he dwelt in was called\r\nHelgoland, and that no one lived north of him.[109] The traveller gave\r\nalso some account of lands more to the south, and even more interesting\r\nfor his royal listener, namely Jutland, Seeland, and Sleswig, that is,\r\nas Alfred is careful to notice, the old mother country: \"In these lands\r\nthe Angles dwelt, before they came hither to this land.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he has to deal with a Latin author, Alfred uses as much liberty. He\r\ntakes the book that the adviser of Theodoric the Great, Boethius, had\r\ncomposed while in prison, and in which we see a personified abstraction,\r\nWisdom, bringing consolation to the unfortunate man threatened with\r\ndeath. No work was more famous in the Middle Ages; it helped to spread\r\nthe taste for abstract personages, owing to which so many shadows,\r\nmen-virtues and men-vices, were to tread the boards of the mediaeval\r\nstage, and the strange plays called _Moralities_ were to enjoy a lasting\r\npopularity. The first in date of the numerous translations made of\r\nBoethius is that of Alfred.\r\n\r\nUnder his pen, the vague Christianity of Boethius[110] becomes a naive\r\nand superabundant faith; each episode is moralised; the affected\r\nelegance of the model disappears, and gives place to an almost childlike\r\nand yet captivating sincerity. The story of the misfortunes of Orpheus,\r\nwritten by Boethius in a very pretentious style, has in Alfred's\r\ntranslation a charm of its own, the charm of the wild flower.\r\n\r\nAmong the innumerable versions of this tale, the king's is certainly the\r\none in which art has the least share, and in which emotion is most\r\ncommunicative: \"It happened formerly that there was a harper in the\r\ncountry called Thrace, which was in Greece. The harper was inconceivably\r\ngood. His name was Orpheus. He had a very excellent wife who was called\r\nEurydice. Then began men to say concerning the harper that he could harp\r\nso that the wood moved, and the stones stirred themselves at the sound,\r\nand the wild beasts would run thereto, and stand as if they were tame;\r\nso still that though men or hounds pursued them, they shunned them not.\r\nThen said they that the harper's wife should die, and her soul should be\r\nled to hell. Then should the harper become so sorrowful that he could\r\nnot remain among other men, but frequented the wood, and sat on the\r\nmountain both day and night, weeping and harping, so that the woods\r\nshook, and the rivers stood still, and no hart shunned any lion, nor\r\nhare any hound; nor did cattle know any hatred, or any fear of others,\r\nfor the pleasure of the sound. Then it seemed to the harper that nothing\r\nin this world pleased him. Then thought he that he would seek the gods\r\nof hell and endeavour to allure them with his harp, and pray that they\r\nwould give him back his wife.\"\r\n\r\nHe goes down to the nether region; at the sweetness of his harping,\r\nCerberus \"began to wag his tail.\" Cerberus was \"the dog of hell; he\r\nshould have three heads.\" \"A very horrible gatekeeper,\" Charon by name,\r\n\"had also three heads,\" according to the calculation of Alfred, whose\r\nmythology is not very safe. Charon welcomes the harper, \"because he was\r\ndesirous of the unaccustomed sound\"; all sufferings cease at the melody\r\nof the harp; the wheel of Ixion ceases to turn; the hunger of Tantalus\r\nis appeased; the vulture ceases to torment King Tityus; and the prayer\r\nof Orpheus is granted.\r\n\r\n\"But men can with difficulty, if at all, restrain love!\" Orpheus\r\nretraces his steps, and, contrary to his promise, looks behind and\r\nstretches his hand towards the beloved shadow, and the shadow fades\r\naway. Moral--for with Alfred everything has a moral--when going to\r\nChrist, never look behind, for fear of being beguiled by the tempter: a\r\npractical conclusion not to be found in Boethius.[111]\r\n\r\nFollowing the king's example, the bishops and monks set to work again.\r\nWerferth, bishop of Worcester, translates the famous dialogues of St.\r\nGregory, filled with miracles and marvellous tales.[112] In the\r\nmonasteries the old national Chronicles, written in the Anglo-Saxon\r\ntongue, are copied, corrected, and continued. These Chronicles existed\r\nbefore Alfred, but they were instilled with a new life owing to his\r\ninfluence. Seven of them have come down to us.[113] It is not yet\r\nhistory; events are registered in succession, usually without comment;\r\nkings ascend the throne and they are killed; bishops are driven from\r\ntheir seats, a storm destroys the crops; the monk notes all these\r\nthings, and does not add a word showing what he thinks of them.[114] He\r\nwrites as a recorder, chary of words. The reader's feelings will be\r\nmoved by the deeds registered, not by the words used. Of kings the\r\nchronicler will often say, \"he was killed,\" without any observation:\r\n\"And king Osric was killed.... And king Selred was killed....\" Why say\r\nmore? it was an everyday occurrence and had nothing curious about it.\r\nBut a comet is not seen every day; a comet is worth describing:\r\n\"678.--In this year, the star [called] comet appeared in August, and\r\nshone for three months every morning like sunbeam. And bishop Wilfrith\r\nwas driven from his bishopric by king Ecgferth.\" We are far from the art\r\nof Gibbon or Carlyle. Few monuments, however, are more precious than\r\nthose old annals; for no people in Europe can pride itself on having\r\nchronicles so ancient written in its national language.\r\n\r\n\"Every craft and every power,\" said Alfred once, speaking there his own\r\nmind, \"soon becomes old and is passed over in silence, if it be without\r\nwisdom.... This is now especially to be said, that I wished to live\r\nhonourably whilst I lived, and, after my life, to leave to the men who\r\nwere after me my memory in good works.\"[115] It happened as he had\r\nwished. Long after his death, his influence was still felt; he was the\r\nideal his successors strove to attain to; even after the Norman Conquest\r\nhe continued to be: \"Englene herde, Englene derling.\"[116]\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nAlfred disappears; disturbances begin again; then, in the course of the\r\ntenth century, comes a fresh period of comparative calm. Edgar is on the\r\nthrone, and the archbishop St. Dunstan rules under his name.[117]\r\n\r\nHelped by Bishop AEthelwold, Dunstan resumed the never-ending and\r\never-threatened task of teaching the people and clergy; he endowed\r\nmonasteries, and like Alfred created new schools and encouraged the\r\ntranslation of pious works. Under his influence collections of sermons\r\nin the vulgar tongue were formed.[118] Several of these collections have\r\ncome down to us: one of them, the Blickling Homilies (from Blickling\r\nHall, Norfolk, where the manuscript was found), was compiled before\r\n971[119]; others are due to the celebrated monk AElfric, who became abbot\r\nof Eynsham in 1005, and wrote most of his works about this time[120];\r\nanother collection includes the sermons of Wulfstan, bishop of York from\r\n1002 to 1023.[121]\r\n\r\nThese sermons, most of which are translated from the Latin, \"sometimes\r\nword for word and sometimes sense for sense,\" according to the example\r\nset by Alfred, were destined for \"the edification of the ignorant, who\r\nknew no language\" except the national one.[122]\r\n\r\nThe congregation being made up mostly of rude, uneducated people, must\r\nbe interested in order that it may listen to the sermons; the homilies\r\nare therefore filled with legendary information concerning the Holy\r\nLand, with minute pictures of the devil and apostles, with edifying\r\ntales full of miracles. In the homilies of Blickling, the church of the\r\nHoly Sepulchre is described in detail, with its sculptured portals, its\r\nstained-glass and its lamps, that threefold holy temple, existing far\r\naway at the other extremity of the world, in the distant East.[123] This\r\nchurch has no roof, so that the sky into which Christ's body ascended\r\ncan be always seen; but, by God's grace, rain water never falls there.\r\nThe preacher is positive about his facts; he has them from travellers\r\nwho have seen with their own eyes this cathedral of Christendom.\r\n\r\nAElfric also keeps alive the interest of the listeners by propounding\r\ndifficult questions to them which he answers himself at once. \"Now many\r\na man will think and inquire whence the devil came?... Now some man will\r\ninquire whence came his [own] soul, whether from the father or the\r\nmother? We say from neither of them; but the same God who created Adam\r\nwith his hands ... that same giveth a soul and life to children.\"[124]\r\nWhy are there no more miracles? \"These wonders were needful at the\r\nbeginning of Christianity, for by these signs was the heathen folk\r\ninclined to faith. The man who plants trees or herbs waters them so long\r\nuntil they have taken root; when they are growing he ceases from\r\nwatering. Also, the Almighty God so long showed his miracles to the\r\nheathen folk until they were believing: when faith had sprung up over\r\nall the world, then miracles ceased.\"[125]\r\n\r\nThe lives of the saints told by AElfric recall at times tales in the\r\nArabian Nights. There are transformations, disparitions, enchantments,\r\nemperors who become hermits, statues that burst, and out of which comes\r\nthe devil. \"Go,\" cries the apostle to the fiend, \"go to the waste where\r\nno bird flies, nor husbandman ploughs, nor voice of man sounds.\" The\r\n\"accursed spirit\" obeys, and he appears all black, \"with sharp visage\r\nand ample beard. His locks hung to his ankles, his eyes were scattering\r\nfiery sparks, sulphureous flame stood in his mouth, he was frightfully\r\nfeather-clad.\"[126] This is already the devil of the Mysteries, the one\r\ndescribed by Rabelais, almost in the same words. We can imagine the\r\neffect of so minute a picture on the Saxon herdsmen assembled on Sunday\r\nin their little mysterious churches, almost windowless, like that of\r\nBradford-on-Avon.\r\n\r\nOne peculiarity makes these sermons remarkable; in them can be discerned\r\na certain effort to attain to literary dignity. The preacher tries his\r\nbest to speak well. He takes all the more pains because he is slightly\r\nashamed, being himself learned, to write in view of such an illiterate\r\npublic. He does not know any longer Alfred's doubts, who, being\r\nuncertain as to which words best express the meaning of his model, puts\r\ndown all those his memory or glossary supply: the reader can choose. The\r\nauthors of these homilies purposely write prose which comes near the\r\ntone and forms of poetry. Such are almost always the beginnings of\r\nliterary prose. They go as far as to introduce a rude cadence in their\r\nwritings, and adapt thereto the special ornament of Germanic verse,\r\nalliteration. Wulfstan and AElfric frequently afford their audience the\r\npleasure of those repeated sonorities, so much so that it has been\r\npossible to publish a whole collection of sermons by the latter in the\r\nform of poems.[127] Moreover, the subject itself is often poetic, and\r\nthe priest adorns his discourse with images and metaphors. Many passages\r\nof the \"Blickling Homilies,\" read in a translation, might easily be\r\ntaken for poetical extracts. Such are the descriptions of\r\ncontemporaneous evils, and of the signs that will herald the end of the\r\nworld, that world that \"fleeth from us with great bitterness, and we\r\nfollow it as it flies from us, and love it although it is passing\r\naway.\"[128]\r\n\r\nSuch are also the descriptions of landscapes, where even now, in this\r\nfinal period of the Anglo-Saxon epoch, northern nature, snow and ice are\r\nvisibly described, as in \"Beowulf,\" with delight, by connoisseurs: \"As\r\nSt. Paul was looking towards the northern region of the earth, from\r\nwhence all waters pass down, he saw above the water a hoary stone, and\r\nnorth of the stone had grown woods, very rimy. And there were dark\r\nmists; and under the stone was the dwelling-place of monsters and\r\nexecrable creatures.\"[129]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThus Anglo-Saxon literature, in spite of the efforts of Cynewulf,\r\nAlfred, Dunstan, and AElfric goes on repeating itself. Poems, histories,\r\nand sermons are conspicuous, now for their grandeur, now for the emotion\r\nthat is in them; but their main qualities and main defects are very much\r\nalike; they give an impression of monotony. The same notes, not very\r\nnumerous, are incessantly repeated. The Angles, Saxons, and other\r\nconquerors who came from Germany have remained, from a literary point of\r\nview, nearly intact in the midst of the subjugated race. Their\r\nliterature is almost stationary; it does not perceptibly move and\r\ndevelop. A graft is wanted; Rome tried to insert one, but a few branches\r\nonly were vivified, not the whole tree; and the fruit is the same each\r\nyear, wild and sometimes poor.\r\n\r\nThe political state of the country leaves on the mind a similar\r\nimpression. The men of Germanic blood established in England remain, or\r\nnearly so, grouped together in tribes; their hamlet is the mother\r\ncountry for them. They are unable to unite against the foreign foe.\r\nTheir subdivisions undergo constant change, much as they did, centuries\r\nbefore, on the Continent. A swarm of petty kings, ignored by history,\r\nare known to have lived and reigned, owing to their name having been\r\nfound appended to charters; there were kings of the Angles of the South,\r\nkings of half Kent, kings with fewer people to rule than a village mayor\r\nof to-day. They are killed, and, as we have seen, the thing is of no\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nThe Danes come again; at one time they own the whole of England, which\r\nis thus subject to the same king as Scandinavia. Periods of unification\r\nare merely temporary, and due to the power or the genius of a prince:\r\nAlfred, AEthelstan, Cnut the Dane; but the people of Great Britain keep\r\ntheir tendency to break up into small kingdoms, into earldoms, as they\r\nwere called in the eleventh century, about the end of the period; into\r\ntribes, in reality, as when they inhabited the Germanic land. Out of\r\nthis chaos how can a nation arise? a nation that may give birth to\r\nShakespeare, crush the Armada, people the American continent? No less\r\nthan a miracle is needed. The miracle took place: it was the battle of\r\nHastings.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[70] \"Hengest and Horsa ... were the sons of Wihtgils; Wihtgils was the\r\nson of Witta, Witta of Wecta, Wecta of Woden. From Woden sprang all our\r\nroyal kin, and the Southumbrians also\" (year 449, \"Anglo-Saxon\r\nChronicle,\" Peterborough text). \"Penda was the son of Pybba, Pybba of\r\nCryda ... Waermund of Wihtlaeg, Wihtlaeg of Woden\" (_Ibid._ year 626).\r\nOrderic Vital, born in England, and writing in Normandy, in the twelfth\r\ncentury, continues to trace back the descent of the kings of England to\r\nWoden: \"a quo Angh feriam [iv]am Wodenis diem nuncupant\" (\"Hist.\r\nEccl.,\" ed. Le Prevost, vol. iii. p 161). \"Wodenis dies\" has become\r\nWednesday. In the same fashion, and even more characteristically, the\r\nfeast of the northern goddess Eostra has become \"Easter\":\r\n\"Eostur-monath, qui nunc paschalis mensis interpretatur, quondam a dea\r\neorum quae Eostre vocabatur ... nomen habuit.\" Bede, \"De Temporum\r\nRatione\" in Migne's \"Patrologia,\" xc., col. 357.

Thorpe, London, Society\r\nof Antiquaries, 1832, 8vo. An edition by Junius (Francis Dujon by his\r\ntrue name, born at Heidelberg, d. at Windsor, 1678) had been published\r\nat Amsterdam in 1655, and may have been known to Milton (_cf._ \"Caedmon\r\nund Milton,\" by R. Wuelcker, in \"Anglia,\" vol. iv. p. 401). Junius was\r\nthe first to attribute this anonymous poem, or rather collection of\r\npoems (\"Genesis,\" \"Exodus,\" \"Daniel,\" \"Christ and Satan\") to Caedmon.\r\n\"Genesis\" is made up of two different versions of different dates,\r\nclumsily put together. German critics, and especially Prof. Ed. Sievers\r\n(\"Der Heliand,\" Halle, 1875), have conclusively shown that lines 1 to\r\n234, and 852 to the end, belong to the same and older version (possibly\r\nby Caedmon); lines 235 to 851, inserted without much care, as they retell\r\npart of the story to be found also in the older version, are of a more\r\nrecent date, and show a strong resemblance to the old Germanic poem\r\n\"Heliand\" (Healer, Saviour) in alliterative verse, of the ninth century.\r\n\r\nAnother biblical story was paraphrased in Anglo-Saxon verse, and was the\r\nsubject of the beautiful poem of \"Judith,\" preserved in the same MS. as\r\n\"Beowulf.\" Grein's \"Bibliothek,\" vol. i.\r\n\r\n[89] \"Metrical Paraphrase,\" pp. 29 ff.\r\n\r\n[90] Four poems have come down to us signed by means of an acrostic on\r\nthe Runic letters of his name: \"Elene\" (on the finding of the cross),\r\n\"Fates of the Apostles\" (both in \"Codex Vercellensis\"), \"Juliana\" and\r\n\"Christ\" (in \"Codex Exoniensis\"); a separate edition of \"Christ\" has\r\nbeen given by M. Gollancz, London, 1892, 8vo. Many other poems, and even\r\nthe whole of \"Codex Vercellensis,\" have been attributed to him. The\r\neighty-nine riddles of \"Codex Exoniensis,\" some of which continue to\r\npuzzle the readers of our day, are also considered by some as his: one\r\nof the riddles is said to contain a charade on his name, but there are\r\ndoubts; ample discussions have taken place, and authorities disagree:\r\n\"The eighty-sixth riddle, which concerns a wolf and a sheep, was\r\nrelated,\" said Dietrich, \"to Cynewulf;\" but Professor Morley considers\r\nthat this same riddle \"means the overcoming of the Devil by the hand of\r\nGod.\" Stopford Brooke, \"Early English Literature,\" chap. xxii. Many of\r\nthose riddles were adapted from the Latin of Aldhelm and others. This\r\nsort of poetry enjoyed great favour, as the Scandinavian \"Corpus\r\nPoeticum\" also testifies.

Resemblances have also\r\nbeen pointed out, showing the frequence of such poetical figures, with\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon inscription of a reliquary preserved at Brussels: \"Rood\r\nis my name, I once bore the rich king, I was wet with dripping blood.\"\r\nThe reliquary contains a piece of the true cross, which is supposed to\r\nspeak these words.

In this last poem occurs one of the few examples we have of familiar\r\ndialogue in Anglo Saxon (a dialogue between Mary and Joseph, the tone of\r\nwhich recalls the Mysteries of a later date); but it seems to be\r\n\"derived from an undiscovered hymn arranged for recital by half choirs.\"\r\nGollancz, \"Christ,\" Introd., p. xxi.

The original seems to have been composed in Greek, at\r\nAlexandria, in the second century of our era (F. Lauchert, \"Geschichte\r\ndes Physiologus,\" Strasbourg, 1889, 8vo). To the \"Physiologi\" succeeded\r\nin the Middle Ages \"Bestiaries,\" works of the same sort, which were also\r\nvery numerous and very popular. A number of commonplace sayings or\r\nbeliefs, which have survived up to our day (the faithfulness of the\r\ndove, the fatherly love of the pelican), are derived from \"Bestiaries.\"\r\n\r\n[98] \"Codex Exoniensis,\" pp. 197 ff.

Harold, son of Godwin, was elected to succeed him.\r\nA momentous crisis, the greatest in English history, was drawing near.\r\n\r\nAn awful problem had to be solved. Divided, helpless, uncertain, England\r\ncould no longer remain what she had been for six hundred years. She\r\nstood vacillating, drawn by contrary attractions to opposite centres,\r\nhalf-way between the North, that had last populated the land, and the\r\nSouth, that had taught and christianised the nation. On both sides fresh\r\ninvaders threaten her; which will be the winner? Should the North\r\ntriumph, England will be bound for centuries to the Germanic nations,\r\nwhose growth will be tardy, and whose literary development will be slow,\r\nso slow indeed that men still alive to-day may have seen with their own\r\neyes the great poet of the race, Goethe, who died in 1832. Should the\r\nSouth carry the day, the growth will be speedy and the preparation\r\nrapid. Like France, Italy, and Spain, England will have at the\r\nRenaissance a complete literature of her own, and be able to produce a\r\nShakespeare, as Italy produced an Ariosto, Spain a Cervantes, and France\r\na Montaigne, a Ronsard and a Rabelais.\r\n\r\nThe problem was solved in the autumn of 1066. On the morrow of Harold's\r\nelection, the armies of the North and South assembled, and the last of\r\nthe invasions began.\r\n\r\nThe Scandinavians took the sea again. They were led by Harold Hardrada,\r\nson of Sigurd, a true romance hero, who had fought in many wars, and\r\nonce defended by his sword the throne of the eastern emperors.[130] To\r\nthe South another fleet collected, commanded by William of Normandy; he,\r\ntoo, an extraordinary man, bastard of that Robert, known in legend as\r\nRobert the Devil who had long since started on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem\r\nfrom which he never returned. The Norman of Scandinavia and the Normans\r\nof France were about to play a match of which England was the stake.\r\n\r\nThe Scandinavians were the first to land. Hardrada entered York, and for\r\na moment it seemed as if victory would belong to the people of the\r\nNorth. But Harold of England rushed to meet them, and crushed them at\r\nStamford-bridge; his brother, the rebel Tosti, fell on the field of\r\nbattle, and Hardrada died of an arrow-wound in the throat. All was over\r\nwith Scandinavia; there remained the Normans of France.\r\n\r\nWho were these Normans? Very different from those of the other army,\r\nthey no longer had anything Scandinavian or Germanic about them; and\r\nthus they stood a chance of furnishing the Anglo-Saxons with the graft\r\nthey needed. Had it not been for this, their invasion would have carried\r\nno more important result than that of the Danes in the ninth century;\r\nbut the consequences were to be very different. The fusion between\r\nRollo's pirates, and the already dense population of the rich province\r\ncalled after them Normandy, had been long accomplished. It was less a\r\nfusion than an absorption, for the natives were much more numerous than\r\nthe settlers. From the time of the second duke, French had again become\r\nthe language of the mass of the inhabitants. They are Christians; they\r\nhave French manners, chivalrous tastes, castles, convents, and schools;\r\nand the blood that flows in their veins is mostly French. Thus it is\r\nthat they can set forth in the eleventh century for the conquest of\r\nEngland as representatives of the South, of Latin civilisation, of\r\nRomance letters, and of the religion of Rome. William comes blessed by\r\nthe Pope, with a banner borne before him, the gift of Alexander II.,\r\nwearing a hair of St. Peter's in a ring, having secured by a vow the\r\nfavour of one of France's patrons, that same St. Martin of Tours, whose\r\nchurch Clovis had enriched, and whose cape Hugues Capet had worn: whence\r\nhis surname.\r\n\r\nNo Beowulf, no northern hero is sung of in William's army; but there\r\nresound the verses of the most ancient masterpiece of French literature,\r\nat that time the most recent. According to the poet Wace, well informed,\r\nsince his father took part in the expedition, the minstrel Taillefer\r\nrode before the soldiers, singing \"of Charlemagne, and of Roland, and\r\nOliver, and the vassals who fell at Roncevaux.\"[131]\r\n\r\nThe army, moreover, was not exclusively composed of men from\r\nNormandy.[132] It was divided into three parts; to the left the Bretons\r\nand Poictevins; the Normans in the centre; and to the right the French,\r\nproperly so called. No doubt was possible; William's army was a French\r\narmy; all contemporary writers describe it as such, and both parties\r\ngive it that name. In the \"Domesday Book,\" written by order of William,\r\nhis people are termed \"Franci\"; on the Bayeux tapestry, embroidered soon\r\nafter the Conquest, at the place where the battle is represented, the\r\ninscription runs: \"Hic Franci pugnant\" (Here fight the French). Crowned\r\nking of England, William continues to call his followers\r\n\"Frenchmen.\"[133] The Anglo-Saxon Chronicles, on the other side,\r\ndescribe the invaders sometimes as Normans and sometimes as Frenchmen,\r\n\"Frenciscan.\" \"And the French had possession of the place of carnage,\"\r\nsays the Worcester annalist, after giving an account of the battle of\r\nHastings; and he bestows the appellation of Normans upon the men of\r\nHarold Hardrada. A similar view is taken farther north. Formerly, we\r\nread in a saga, the same tongue was spoken in England and Norway, but\r\nnot after the coming of William of Normandy, \"because he was\r\nFrench.\"[134]\r\n\r\nAs to Duke William, he led his army of Frenchmen in French fashion, that\r\nis to say gaily. His state of mind is characterised not by any overflow\r\nof warlike joy or fury, but by good humour. Like the heroes of the\r\nCeltic poems, like the inhabitants of Gaul in all ages, he is prompt at\r\nrepartee (_argute loqui_). He stumbles in stepping off the ship, which\r\nis considered by all as a bad omen: \"It is a most fatal omen,\" we read\r\nin an ancient Scandinavian poem, \"if thou stumble on thy feet when\r\nmarching to battle, for evil fairies stand on either side of thee,\r\nwishing to see thee wounded.\"[135] It means nothing, said the duke to\r\nhis followers, save that I take possession of the land. At the moment of\r\nbattle he puts his hauberk on the wrong way: another bad omen. Not at\r\nall, he declares, it is a sign I shall turn out different; \"King I shall\r\nbe, who duke was\":\r\n\r\n    Le nom qui ert de duchee\r\n    Verreiz de due en rei torne;\r\n    Reis serai qui duc ai este.[136]\r\n\r\nHe challenges Harold to single combat, as the Gauls did their\r\nadversaries, according to Diodorus Siculus; and as Francis I. will do\r\nlater when at feud with Charles V. He was to die in an expedition\r\nundertaken out of revenge for an epigram of the king of France, and to\r\nmake good his retort.\r\n\r\nThe evening of the 14th of October, 1066, saw the fate of England\r\ndecided. The issue of the battle was doubtful. William, by a series of\r\ningenious ideas, secured the victory. His foes were the victims of his\r\ncleverness; they were \"ingenio circumventi, ingenio victi.\"[137] He\r\nordered his soldiers to simulate a flight; he made his archers shoot\r\nupwards, so that the arrows falling down among the Saxons wrought great\r\nhavoc. One of them put out Harold's eye; the English chief fell by his\r\nstandard, and soon after the battle was over, the most memorable ever\r\nwon by an army of Frenchmen.\r\n\r\nThe duke had vowed to erect on the field of the fight an abbey to St.\r\nMartin of Tours. He kept his word, but the building never bore among men\r\nthe name of the saint; it received and has retained to this day the\r\nappellation of \"Battle.\" Its ruins, preserved with pious care, overlook\r\nthe dales where the host of the Conqueror gathered for the attack. Far\r\noff through the hills, then covered by the yellowing leaves of the\r\nforest of Anderida, glistens, between earth and sky, the grey sea that\r\nbrought over the Norman fleet eighteen centuries ago. Heaps of stones,\r\novergrown with ivy, mark the place where Harold fell, the last king of\r\nEnglish blood who ever sat upon the throne of Great Britain. It is a\r\nsecluded spot; large cedars, alders, and a tree with white foliage form\r\na curtain, and shut off from the outer world the scene of the terrible\r\ntragedy. A solemn silence reigns; nothing is visible through the\r\nbranches, save the square tower of the church of Battle, and the only\r\nsound that floats upwards is that of the old clock striking the hours.\r\nIvy and climbing roses cling to the grey stones and fall in light\r\nclusters along the low walls of the crypt; the roses shed their leaves,\r\nand the soft autumn breeze scatters the white petals on the grass,\r\namidst fragments to which is attached one of the greatest memories in\r\nthe history of humanity.\r\n\r\nThe consequences of \"the Battle\" were indeed immense, far more important\r\nthan those of Agincourt or Austerlitz: a whole nation was transformed\r\nand became a new one. The vanquished Anglo-Saxons no more knew how to\r\ndefend themselves and unite against the French than they had formerly\r\nknown how to unite against the Danes. To the momentary enthusiasm that\r\nhad gathered around Harold many energetic supporters succeeded a gloomy\r\ndejection. Real life exhibited the same contrasts as literature. Stirred\r\nby sudden impulses, the natives vainly struggled to free themselves,\r\nincapable even in this pressing danger of combined and vigorous action;\r\nthen they mournfully submitted to fate. The only contemporary\r\ninterpreter of their feelings known to us, the Anglo-Saxon chronicler,\r\nbewails the Conquest, but is more struck by the ravages it occasions\r\nthan by the change of domination it brings about. \"And Bishop Odo and\r\nEarl William [Fitz-Osbern],\" he says, \"remained here and wrought castles\r\nwidely throughout the nation, and oppressed the poor people, and ever\r\nafter that it greatly grew in evil. May the end be good when God will.\"\r\nSo much for the material disaster, now for the coming of the foreigner:\r\n\"And then came to meet him Archbishop Ealdred [of York], and Eadgar\r\nchild and Earl Eadwine, and Earl Morkere, and all the best men of\r\nLondon, and then, from necessity, submitted when the greatest harm had\r\nbeen done, and it was very imprudent that it was not done earlier, as\r\nGod would not better it for our sins.\"[138]\r\n\r\nPeople with a mind so full of elegiac sentiments fall an easy prey to\r\nmen who know how to _will_. Before dying William had taken everything,\r\neven a part of Wales; he was king of England, and had so completely\r\nchanged the fortunes of his new country that its inhabitants, so used to\r\ninvasions, were never again to see rise, from that day to this, the\r\nsmoke of an enemy's camp.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nFrom the outset William seems to have desired and foreseen it.\r\nPractical, clear-minded, of firm will, imbued with the notion of State,\r\nhe possessed in the highest degree the qualities his new subjects most\r\nlacked. He knew neither doubts nor vain hesitations; he was an optimist,\r\nalways sure of success: not with the certitude of the blind who walk\r\nconfidently to the river, but with the assurance of clear-sighted\r\npeople, who leave the goddess Fortune so little to do, it were a miracle\r\nif she did less for them. His lucid and persistent will is never at\r\nfault. In the most critical moment of the battle a fatal report is\r\ncirculated that the duke has been killed; he instantly tears off his\r\nhelmet and shows himself with uncovered face, crying: \"I am alive! here\r\nI stand, and by God I shall conquer!\"[139]\r\n\r\nAll his life, he conforms his actions to his theories; having come as\r\nthe heir of the Anglo-Saxon princes, he behaves as such. He visits his\r\nestate, rectifies its boundaries, protects its approaches, and, in spite\r\nof the immensity of the work, takes a minute inventory of it.[140]\r\n\r\nThis inventory is the Domesday, a unique monument, such that no nation\r\nin Europe possesses the like. On the coins, he so exactly imitates the\r\ntype adopted by his predecessors that it is hard to distinguish the\r\npennies of William from those of Edward. Before the end of his reign, he\r\nwas the master or conqueror of all, and had made his authority felt and\r\naccepted by all, even by his brother Bishop Odo, whom he arrested with\r\nhis own hands, and caused to be imprisoned \"as Earl of Kent,\" he said,\r\nwith his usual readiness of word, to avoid a quarrel with the Church.\r\n\r\nAnd so it was that, in spite of their terrible sufferings, the\r\nvanquished were unable to repress a certain sentiment which predisposed\r\nthem to a fusion with the victor, namely admiration. Never had they seen\r\nenergy, power, or knowledge like unto that. The judgment of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon chronicler on William may be considered as being the\r\njudgment of the nation itself concerning its new masters: \"That King\r\nWilliam about whom we speak was a very wise man, and very powerful, more\r\ndignified and strong than any of his predecessors were. He was mild to\r\nthe good men who loved God, and over all measure severe to the men who\r\ngainsayed his will.... So also was he a very rigid and cruel man, so\r\nthat no one durst do anything against his will.... He spared not his own\r\nbrother named Odo.... Among other things is not to be forgotten the good\r\npeace that he made in this land, so that a man who had any confidence in\r\nhimself might go over his realm with his bosom full of gold unhurt.\" The\r\nland of the Britons, \"Brytland\" or Wales, was in his power, Scotland\r\nlikewise; he would have had Ireland besides had he reigned two years\r\nlonger. It is true he greatly oppressed the people, built castles, and\r\nmade terrible game-laws: \"As greatly did he love the tall deer as if he\r\nwere their father. He also ordained concerning the hares that they\r\nshould go free.\"[141] Even in the manner of presenting grievances we\r\ndetect that special kind of popularity which attaches itself to the\r\ntyranny of great men. The England of the Anglo-Saxons had been defeated,\r\nbut brilliant destinies were in store for the country; the master was\r\nhated but not despised.\r\n\r\nThese great destinies were realised. The qualities of which William gave\r\nthe example were rare in England, but common in France; they were those\r\nof his race and country, those of his lieutenants; they naturally\r\nreappear in many of his successors. These are, as a rule, energetic and\r\nheadstrong men, who never hesitate, who believe in themselves, are\r\nalways ready to run all hazards, and to attempt the impossible, with the\r\nfirm conviction that they will succeed; they are never weary of fighting\r\nand taking; the moment never comes when they can enjoy their conquests\r\nin peace; in good as in evil they never stop half-way; those who incline\r\nto tyranny become, like Stephen, the most atrocious tyrants[142]; those\r\nwho incline to the manners and customs of chivalry carry them, like\r\nRichard Coeur de Lion, as far as possible, and forget that they have a\r\nkingdom to rule. The most intelligent become, like Henry II.,\r\nincomparable statesmen; those who have a taste for art give themselves\r\nup to it with such passion that they jeopardise, like Henry III., even\r\ntheir crown, and care for nothing but their masons and painters. They\r\nare equally ready for sword and word fights, and they offer both to all\r\ncomers. They constantly risk their lives; out of twelve Norman or\r\nAngevin princes six die a violent death.\r\n\r\nAll their enterprises are conceived on a gigantic scale. They carry war\r\ninto Scotland, into Ireland, into Wales, into France, into Gascony,\r\nlater on into the Holy Land and into Spain. The Conqueror was on his way\r\nto Paris when he received, by accident, being at Mantes, fifteen leagues\r\nfrom the capital, a wound of which he died. These qualities are in the\r\nblood. A Frenchman, Henry of Burgundy, seizes on the county of \"Porto\"\r\nin 1095, out of which his successors make the kingdom of \"Portugal\"; a\r\nNorman, Robert Guiscard, conquers Sicily, takes Naples, forces his\r\nalliance upon the Pope, overawes Venice, and the same year beats the two\r\nemperors; his son Bohemond establishes himself as reigning prince in\r\nAntioch in 1099, and fighting with great composure and equanimity\r\nagainst Turk and Christian, establishes out of hand a little kingdom\r\nwhich lasted two centuries. They find in England miserable churches;\r\nthey erect new ones, \"of a style unknown till then,\" writes William of\r\nMalmesbury,[143] which count among the grandest ever built. The splendid\r\nnaves of St. Albans, Westminster, Canterbury, Winchester, York,\r\nSalisbury, rise heavenwards; the towers of Ely reach to the skies; the\r\nwest front of Lincoln, adorned with marvellous carvings, rears itself on\r\nthe hill above the town; Peterborough opens its wide bays, deep as the\r\nportals of French churches; Durham, a heavy and massive pile built by\r\nknight-bishops, overlooks the valley of the Wear, and seems a divine\r\nfortress, a castle erected for God. The donjons of the conquerors,\r\nRochester, London, Norwich, Lincoln, are enormous, square and thick, so\r\nhigh and so solid that the idea of taking these giant structures could\r\nnever occur to the native dreamers, who wait \"till the end shall be good\r\nwhen God pleases\"!\r\n\r\nThe masters of the land are ever ready for everything, and find time for\r\neverything: if their religious edifices are considered, it seems as\r\nthough they had cared for nothing else; if we read the accounts of their\r\nwars, it appears as if they were ever on their way to military\r\nexpeditions, and never left the field of battle. Open the innumerable\r\nmanuscripts which contain the monuments of their literature: these works\r\ncan be meant, it seems, but for men of leisure, who have interminable\r\ndays to spend in lengthy pastimes; they make their Benoits de\r\nSainte-More give them an account of their origins in chronicles of\r\n43,000 lines. This literature is ample, superabundant, with numberless\r\nbranches and endless ramifications; they have not even one literature\r\nonly; they have three: a French, a Latin, and later an English one.\r\n\r\nTheir matchless strength and their indomitable will further one\r\nparticular cause: the infusion of French and Latin ideas in the\r\nAnglo-Saxon people, and the connection of England with the civilisations\r\nof the South. The task was arduous: Augustine, Alfred, Dunstan, kings\r\nand saints, had attempted it and failed; the Normans tried and\r\nsucceeded. They were ever successful.\r\n\r\nPowerful means were at their disposal, and they knew how to make the\r\nbest of them. Firstly, the chiefs of the nation are French; their wives\r\nare mostly French too: Stephen, Henry II., John, Henry III., Edward I.,\r\nEdward II., Richard II., all marry Frenchwomen. The Bohuns (from whom\r\ncame the Herefords, Essexes, Northamptons), the Beauchamps (Warwick),\r\nthe Mowbrays (Nottingham, Norfolk), the Bigods (Norfolk), the Nevilles\r\n(Westmoreland, Warwick), the Montgomerys (Shrewsbury, Pembroke,\r\nArundel), the Beaumonts and the Montforts (Leicester), are Frenchmen.\r\nPeople of less importance married to English women--\"matrimonia quoque\r\ncum subditis jungunt\"[144]--rear families which for many years remain\r\nFrench.\r\n\r\nDuring a long period, the centre of the thoughts and interests of the\r\nkings of England, French by origin, education, manners, and language, is\r\nin France. William the Conqueror bequeaths Normandy to his eldest son,\r\nand England to his younger. Not one of them is buried at Westminster\r\nbefore 1272; they sleep their last sleep most of them at Caen or\r\nFontevrault[145]; out of the thirty-five years of his reign, Henry II.\r\nspends more than twenty-one in France, and less than fourteen in\r\nEngland.[146] Before his accession Richard Coeur-de-Lion only came to\r\nEngland twice in twenty years. They successively make war on France, not\r\nfrom hatred or scorn, not because they wish to destroy her, but because\r\nthey wish to be kings of France themselves. They admire and wish to\r\npossess her; their ideal, whether moral, literary, administrative, or\r\nreligious, is above all a French ideal. They are knights, and introduce\r\ninto England the fashion of tournaments, \"conflictus gallici,\" says\r\nMatthew Paris. They wish to have a University, and they copy for Oxford\r\nthe regulations of Paris. Henry III. quarrels with his barons, and whom\r\ndoes he select for an arbiter but his former enemy, Louis IX., king of\r\nFrance, the victor of Taillebourg? They organise in England a religious\r\nhierarchy, so similar to that of France that the prelates of one country\r\nreceive constantly and without difficulty promotion in the other. John\r\nof Poictiers, born in Kent, treasurer of York, becomes bishop of\r\nPoictiers and archbishop of Lyons, while still retaining the living of\r\nEynesford in Kent; John of Salisbury, secretary of the archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, becomes bishop of Chartres; Ralph de Sarr, born in Thanet,\r\nbecomes dean of Reims[147]; others are appointed bishops of Palermo,\r\nMessina, and Syracuse.\r\n\r\nImpetuous as are these princes, ready at every instant to run all risks\r\nand play fast and loose, even when, like William I., old and ill, one\r\nprecious quality of their temper diminishes the danger of their\r\nrashness. They undertake, as though for a wager, superhuman tasks, but\r\nonce undertaken they proceed to the fulfilling of them with a lucid and\r\npractical mind. It is this practical bent of their mind, combined with\r\ntheir venturesome disposition, that has made of them so remarkable a\r\nrace, and enabled them to transform the one over which they had now\r\nextended their rule.\r\n\r\nBe the question a question of ideas or a question of facts, they behave\r\nin the same manner. They perceive the importance both of ideas and of\r\nthose who wield them, and act accordingly; they negotiate with the Pope,\r\nwith St. Martin of Tours, even with God; they promise nothing for\r\nnothing; however exalted the power with which they treat, what they\r\nagree to must be bargains, Norman bargains.\r\n\r\nThe bull \"Laudabiliter,\" by which the English Pope\r\nNicholas Breakspeare (Adrian IV.) gives Ireland to Henry II., is a\r\nformal bargain; the king buys, the Pope sells; the price is minutely\r\ndiscussed beforehand, and set down in the agreement.[148] But the most\r\nremarkable view suggested to them by this practical turn of their mind\r\nconsisted in the value they chose to set, even at that distant time, on\r\n\"public opinion,\" if we may use the expression, and on literature as a\r\nmeans of action.\r\n\r\nThis was a stroke of genius; William endeavoured, and his successors\r\nimitated him, to do for the past what he was doing for the present: to\r\nunify. For this, the new dynasty wanted the assistance of poets, and it\r\ncalled upon them. William had persistently given himself out to be not\r\nonly the successor, but the rightful heir of Edward the Confessor, and\r\nof the native kings. During several centuries the poets who wrote in the\r\nFrench tongue, the Latin chroniclers, the English rhymers, as though\r\nobedient to a word of command, blended all the origins together in their\r\nbooks; French, Danes, Saxons, Britons, Trojans even, according to them,\r\nformed one sole race; all these men had found in England a common\r\ncountry, and their united glories were the general heritage of\r\nposterity. With a persistency which lasted from century to century, they\r\ndisplaced the national point of view, and ended by establishing, with\r\nevery one's assent, the theory that the constitution and unity of a\r\nnation are a question not of blood but of place; consanguinity matters\r\nlittle; the important point is to be compatriots. All the inhabitants of\r\nthe same country are one people: the Saxons of England and the French of\r\nEngland are nothing but Englishmen.\r\n\r\nAll the heroes who shone in the British Isle are now indiscriminately\r\nsung by the poets, who celebrate Brutus, Arthur, Hengist, Horsa, Cnut,\r\nEdward, and William in impartial strains. They venerate in the same\r\nmanner all saints of whatever blood who have won heaven by the practice\r\nof virtue on English ground. Here again the king, continuing the wise\r\npolicy of his ancestors, sets the example. On Easter Day, 1158, Henry\r\nII. and his wife Alienor of Aquitaine enter the cathedral of Worcester,\r\nwearing their crowns, and present themselves before the tomb of the holy\r\nprotector of the town. They remove their crowns, place them on his tomb,\r\nand swear never to wear them again. The saint was not a French one, but\r\nWulfstan, the last Anglo-Saxon bishop, one who held the see at the time\r\nof the Conquest.[149]\r\n\r\nThe word of command has been given; the clerks know it. Here is a poem\r\nof the thirteenth century, on Edward the Confessor; it is composed in\r\nthe French tongue by a Norman monk of Westminster Abbey, and dedicated\r\nto Alienor of Provence, wife of Henry III. In it we read: \"In this world\r\nthere is, we dare to say, neither country, nor kingdom, nor empire where\r\nso many good kings and saints have lived as in the isle of the English\r\n... holy martyrs and confessors, many of whom died for God; others were\r\nvery strong and brave as Arthur, Edmond, and Cnut.\"[150]\r\n\r\nThis is a characteristic example of these new tendencies. The poem is\r\ndedicated to a Frenchwoman by a Norman of England, and begins with the\r\npraise of a Briton, a Saxon, and a Dane.\r\n\r\nIn the compiling of chronicles, clerks proceed in the same manner, and\r\nthis is still more significant, for it clearly proves that the pressing\r\nof literature into the service of political ideas is the result of a\r\ndecided will, and of a preconceived plan, and not of chance. The\r\nchroniclers do, indeed, write by command, and by express desire of the\r\nkings their masters. One of them begins his history of England with the\r\nsiege of Troy, and relates the adventures of the Trojans and Britons, as\r\nwillingly as those of the Saxons or Normans; another writes two separate\r\nbooks, the first in honour of the Britons, and the second in honour of\r\nthe Normans; a third, who goes back to the time when \"the world was\r\nestablished,\" does not get down to the dukes of Normandy without having\r\nnarrated first the story of Antenor the Trojan, an ancestor of the\r\nNormans, as he believes.[151] The origin of the inhabitants of the land\r\nmust no longer be sought for under Scandinavian skies, but on Trojan\r\nfields. From the smoking ruins of Pergamus came Francus, father of the\r\nFrench, and AEneas, father of Brutus and of the Britons of England. Thus\r\nthe nations on both sides of the Channel have a common and classic\r\nancestry. There is Trojan blood in their veins, the blood of Priam and\r\nof the princes who defended Ilion.[152]\r\n\r\nFrom theory, these ideas passed into practice, and thus received a\r\nlasting consecration; another bond of fraternity was established between\r\nthe various races living on the soil of Britain: that which results from\r\nthe memory of wars fought together. William and his successors do not\r\ndistinguish between their subjects. All are English, and they are all\r\nled together to battle against their foes of the Continent. So that this\r\ncollection of scattered tribes, on an island which a resolute invader\r\nhad formerly found it so easy to conquer, now gains victories in its\r\nturn, and takes an unexpected rank among nations. David Bruce is made\r\nprisoner at Neville's Cross; Charles de Blois at Roche Derien; King John\r\nat Poictiers; Du Guesclin at Navarette. Hastings has made the defeat of\r\nthe Armada possible; William of Normandy stamped on the ground, and a\r\nnation came forth.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[130] The romantic events in the life of Harold Hardrada Sigurdson are\r\nthe subject of an Icelandic saga in prose, by Snorre Sturlason (born at\r\nHvam in Iceland, 1178): \"The Heimskringla Saga, or the Sagas of the\r\nNorse kings, from the Icelandic of Snorre Sturlason,\" ed.

Lucanus states that the men of Auvergne\r\nwere conceited enough to consider themselves allied to the Trojan race.\r\nAmmianus Marcellinus, fourth century, states that similar traditions\r\nwere current in Gaul in his time: \"Aiunt quidam paucos post excidium\r\nTrojae fugientes Graecos ubique dispersos, loca haec occupasse tunc vacua.\"\r\n\"Rerum Gestarum,\" lib. xv. cap. ix. During the Middle Ages a Roman\r\nancestry was attributed to the French, the Britons, the Lombards, the\r\nNormans.

Stevenson, Historical Society,\r\nLondon, 1838, p. 7). The English historians after him, up to modern\r\ntimes, accepted the same legend; it is reproduced by Matthew Paris in\r\nthe thirteenth century, by Ralph Higden in the fourteenth, by Holinshed\r\nin Shakesperean times: \"This Brutus ... was the sonne of Silvius, the\r\nsonne of Ascanius, the sonne of AEneas the Troian, begotten of his wife\r\nCreusa, and borne in Troie, before the citie was destroied.\" Chronicles,\r\n1807, 6 vols. fol. book ii. chap. 1.

By the rapidity\r\nand thoroughness of their conquest, by securing to themselves the\r\nassistance of those who knew how to use a pen, by their continental\r\nwars, they were to bring about the fusion of all the races in one, and\r\nteach them, whether they intended it or not, what a mother country was.\r\n\r\nThey taught them something else besides, and the results of the Conquest\r\nwere not less remarkable from a literary than from a political point of\r\nview. A new language and new ideas were introduced by them into England,\r\nand a strange phenomenon occurred, one almost unique in history. For\r\nabout two or three hundred years, the French language remained\r\nsuperimposed upon the English; the upper layer slowly infiltrated the\r\nlower, was absorbed, and disappeared in transforming it. But this was\r\nthe work of centuries. \"And then comes, lo!\" writes an English\r\nchronicler more than two hundred years after Hastings, \"England into\r\nNormandy's hand; and the Normans could speak no language but their own,\r\nand they spoke French here as they did at home, and taught it to their\r\nchildren: so that the high men of this land, who are come of their\r\nrace, keep all to that speech which they have taken from them.\" People\r\nof a lower sort, \"low men,\" stick to their English; all those who do not\r\nknow French are men of no account. \"I ween that in all the world there\r\nis no country that holds not to her own speech, save England\r\nalone.\"[153]\r\n\r\nThe diffusion of the French tongue was such that it seemed at one time\r\nas if a disappearance of English were possible. All over the great\r\nisland people were found speaking French, and they were always the most\r\npowerful, the strongest, richest, or most knowing in the land, whose\r\nfavour it was well to gain, and whose example it was well to imitate.\r\nMen who spoke only English remained all their lives, as Robert of\r\nGloucester tells us, men of \"little,\" of nothing. In order to become\r\nsomething the first condition was to learn French. This condition\r\nremained so long a necessary one, it was even impossible to foresee that\r\nit should ever cease to exist; and the wisest, during that period, were\r\nof opinion that only works written in French were assured of longevity.\r\nGerald de Barry, who had written in Latin, regretted at the end of his\r\nlife that he had not employed the French language, \"gallicum,\" which\r\nwould have secured to his works, he thought, a greater and more lasting\r\nfame.[154]\r\n\r\nBesides the force lent to it by the Conquest, the diffusion of the\r\nFrench tongue was also facilitated by the marvellous renown it then\r\nenjoyed throughout Europe. Never had it a greater; men of various races\r\nwrote it, and the Italian Brunetto Latini, who used it, gave among other\r\nreasons for so doing, \"that this speech is more delightful and more\r\ncommon to all people.\"[155] Such being the case, it spread quickly in\r\nEngland, where it was, for a long time, the language used in laws and\r\ndeeds, in the courts of justice, in Parliamentary debates,[156] the\r\nlanguage used by the most refined poets of the period.\r\n\r\nAnd thus it happened that next to authors, French by race and language,\r\nsubjects of the kings of England, were found others employing the same\r\nidiom, though of English blood. They strove, to the best of their\r\npossibility, to imitate the style in favour with the rulers of the land,\r\nthey wrote chronicles in French, as did, in the twelfth and fourteenth\r\ncenturies, Jordan Fantosme[157] and Peter de Langtoft; religious poems,\r\nas Robert of Greteham, Robert Grosseteste, William of Wadington did in\r\nthe thirteenth; romances in verse, like those of Hue of Rotelande\r\n(twelfth century); moralised tales in prose, like those of Nicole Bozon;\r\nlyric poems,[158] or _fabliaux_,[159] like those composed by various\r\nanonymous writers; ballads such as those we owe, quite at the end of the\r\nperiod, in the second half of the fourteenth century, to Chaucer's\r\nfriend, John Gower.\r\n\r\nAt this distance from the Conquest, French still played an important,\r\nthough greatly diminished, part; it remained, as will be seen, the\r\nlanguage of the Court; the accounts of the sittings of Parliament\r\ncontinued to be written in French; a London citizen registered in French\r\non his note-book all that he knew concerning the history of his\r\ntown.[160] As Robert of Gloucester had said, the case was an\r\nunparalleled one. This French literature, the work of Englishmen,\r\nconsisted, of course, mainly in imitations of French models, and need\r\nnot detain us long; still, its existence must be remembered, for no\r\nother fact shows so well how thorough and powerful the French invasion\r\nhad been.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, were the models copied by these imitators, and what the\r\nliterature and ideas that, thanks to the Conquest, French-speaking poets\r\nacclimatised in lately-Germanic England? What sort of works pleased the\r\nrulers of the country; what writings were composed for them; what\r\nmanuscripts did they order to be copied for their libraries? For it must\r\nnot be forgotten, when studying the important problem of the diffusion\r\nof French ideas among men of English race, that it matters little\r\nwhether the works most liked in England were composed by French subjects\r\nof the king of France, or by French subjects of the king of England; it\r\nmatters little whether these ideas went across the Channel, carried over\r\nby poets, or by manuscripts. What _is_ important is to see and\r\nascertain that works of a new style, with new aims in them, and\r\nbelonging to a new school of art, enjoyed in England a wide popularity\r\nafter the Conquest, with the result that deep and lasting\r\ntransformations affected the aesthetic ideal and even the way of thinking\r\nof the inhabitants. What, then, were these ideas, and what was this\r\nliterature?\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nThis literature little resembled that liked by the late masters of the\r\ncountry. It was as varied, superabundant, and many-coloured as the other\r\nwas grand, monotonous, and melancholy. The writings produced or simply\r\nadmired by the conquerors were, like themselves, at once practical and\r\nromantic. They had, together with a multitude of useful works, a number\r\nof charming songs and tales, the authors of which had no aim but to\r\nplease.\r\n\r\nThe useful works are those so-called scientific treatises in which\r\neverything is taught that can be learned, including virtue: \"Image du\r\nMonde,\" \"Petite Philosophie,\" \"Lumiere des laiques,\" \"Secret des\r\nSecrets,\" &c.[161]; or those chronicles which so efficaciously served\r\nthe political views of the rulers of the land; or else pious works that\r\nshowed men the way to heaven.\r\n\r\nThe principal historical works are, as has been seen, those rhymed in\r\nthe twelfth century by Gaimar, Wace, and Benoit de Sainte-More, lengthy\r\nstories, each being more flowery than its predecessor, and more thickly\r\nstudded with digressions of all sorts, and descriptions in all colours,\r\nwritten in short and clear verse, with bell-like tinklings. The style is\r\nlimpid, simple, transparent: it flows like those wide rivers without\r\ndykes, which cover immense spaces with still and shallow water.[162]\r\n\r\nIn the following century the most remarkable work is the biography in\r\nverse of William le Marechal, earl of Pembroke, one of those knights of\r\nproud mien who still appear to breathe as they lie on their tombs in\r\nTemple Church. This Life is the best of its kind and period; the\r\nanonymous author who wrote it to order has the gift, unknown to his\r\npredecessors, of condensing his subject, of grouping his characters, of\r\nmaking them move and talk. As in the Temple Church, on the monument he\r\nerects to them, they seem to be living.[163]\r\n\r\nAnother century passes, the fashion of writing history in French verse\r\nstill subsists, but will soon die out. Peter de Langtoft, a true\r\nEnglishman as his language sufficiently proves, yet versifies in French,\r\nin the fourteenth century, a history of England from the creation of the\r\nworld to the death of Edward I. But the times are changing, and Peter,\r\nlast representative of an art that is over,[164] is a contemporary of\r\nthat other Englishman, Robert of Gloucester, first representative of an\r\nart that begins, a distant ancestor of Gibbon and Macaulay. In sedate\r\nand manly, but somewhat monotonous strains, Robert tells in his turn the\r\nhistory of his country; differing in this respect from the others, he\r\nuses the English tongue; he is by no means cosmopolitan, but only and\r\nsolely English. In the very first lines he makes this characteristic\r\ndeclaration: \"England is a very good land; I ween the best of any....\r\nThe sea goes all about it; it stands as in an isle; it has the less to\r\nfear from foes.... Plenty of all goods may be found in England.\"[165]\r\n\r\nThe way to heaven is taught, after the Conquest, in innumerable French\r\nworks, in verse and prose, paraphrases of the psalms and gospels, lives\r\nof the saints, manuals of penitence, miracles of Our Lady, moralised\r\ntales, bestiaries, and sermons.[166] The number of the French-speaking\r\npopulation had so increased in the kingdom that it was not absurd to\r\npreach in French, and some of the clergy inclined all the more willingly\r\nto so doing that many of the higher prelates in the land were Frenchmen.\r\n\"To the simple folk,\" says, in French, an Anglo-Norman preacher, \"have I\r\nsimply made a simple sermon. I did not make it for the learned, as they\r\nhave enough writings and discourses. For these young people who are not\r\nscholars I made it in the Romance tongue, for better will they\r\nunderstand the language they have been accustomed to since childhood.\"\r\n\r\n    A la simple gent\r\n    Ai fait simplement\r\n    Un simple sarmun.\r\n    Nel fis as letrez\r\n    Car il unt assez\r\n    Escriz e raisun.\r\n\r\n    Por icels enfanz\r\n    Le fis en romanz\r\n    Qui ne sunt letre\r\n    Car miel entendrunt\r\n    La langue dunt sunt\r\n    Des enfance use.[167]\r\n\r\nReligious works, as well as the chronicles, are mainly written in a\r\nclear, thin, transparent style; neither sight nor thought is absorbed by\r\nthem; the world can be seen through the light religious veil; the\r\nreader's attention wanders. In truth, the real religious poems we owe to\r\nthe Normans are those poems in stone, erected by their architects at\r\nEly, Canterbury, York, and Durham.\r\n\r\nMuch more conspicuous was the literature of the imagination composed for\r\nthem, a radiant literature made of numberless romaunts, songs, and\r\nlove-tales. They had no taste for the doleful tunes of the Anglo-Saxon\r\npoet; his sadness was repellent to them, his despairs they abhorred;\r\nthey turned the page and shut the book with great alacrity. They were\r\nhappy men; everything went well with them; they wanted a literature\r\nmeant for happy men.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nFirst of all they have epic tales; but how different from \"Beowulf\"! The\r\nSong of Roland, sung at Hastings, which was then the national song of\r\nthe Normans as well as of all Frenchmen, is the most warlike poem in the\r\nliterature of mediaeval France, the one that best recalls the Germanic\r\norigins of the race; yet a wide interval already separates these origins\r\nfrom the new nation; the change is striking.[168] Massacres, it is true,\r\nstill occupy the principal place, and a scent of blood pervades the\r\nentire poem; hauberks torn open, bodies hewn in two, brains scattered on\r\nthe grass, the steam rising from the battle, fill the poet's heart with\r\nrapture, and his soul is roused to enthusiasm. But a place is also kept\r\nfor tender sentiments, and another for winged speeches. Woman is not yet\r\nthe object of this tenderness; Charlemagne's peers do not remember Aude\r\nwhile they fight; they expire without giving her a sigh. But their eyes\r\nare dim with tears at the recollection of fair France; they weep to see\r\ntheir companions lie prostrate on the grass; the real mistress of\r\nRoland, the one to whom his last thought reverts, is not Aude but\r\nDurandal, his sword. This is his love, the friend of his life, whose\r\nfate, after he shall be no more, preoccupies him. Just as this sword has\r\na name, it has a life of its own; Roland wishes it to die with him; he\r\nwould like to kill it, as a lover kills his mistress to prevent her\r\nfalling into the hands of miscreants. \"The steel grates, but neither\r\nbreaks nor notches. And the earl cries: Holy Mary, help me!... Ah!\r\nDurandal, so dearly beloved, how white and clear thou art! how thou\r\nshinest and flashest in the sunlight.... Ah! Durandal, fair and holy art\r\nthou!\"[169] In truth, this is his love. Little, however, does it matter\r\nto ascertain with what or whom Roland is in love; the thing to be\r\nremembered is that he has a heart which can be touched and moved, and\r\ncan indeed feel, suffer, and love.\r\n\r\nAt Roncevaux, as well as at Hastings, French readiness of wit appears\r\neven in the middle of the battle. Archbishop Turpin, so imposing when he\r\nbestows the last benediction on the row of corpses, keeps all through\r\nthe fight a good-humour similar to that of the Conqueror. \"This Saracen\r\nseems to me something of a heretic,\"[170] he says, espying an enemy; and\r\nhe fells him to earth. Oliver, too, in a passage which shows that if\r\nwoman has no active part assigned to her in the poem she had begun to\r\nplay an important one in real life, slays the caliph and says: Thou at\r\nleast shalt not go boasting of our defeat, \"either to thy wife or to any\r\nlady in thy land.\"[171]\r\n\r\nIt will finally be noticed that the subject of this epic, the oldest in\r\nFrance, is a defeat, thus showing, even in that far-distant age, what\r\nthe heroic ideal of the nation was to be, that is, not so much to\r\ntriumph as to die well. She will never lay down her arms merely because\r\nshe is beaten; she will only lay them down when enough of her sons have\r\nperished. Even when victory becomes impossible, the nation, however\r\nresigned to the inevitable, still fights for honour. Such as we see her\r\nin the Song of Roland, such she appears in Froissart, and such she has\r\never shown herself: \"For never was the realm of France so broken, but\r\nthat some one to fight against could be found there.\"[172]\r\n\r\nThe conquerors of England are complete men; they are not only valiant,\r\nthey are learned; they not only take interest in the immediate past of\r\ntheir own race; they are also interested in the distant past of other\r\ncivilised nations; they make their poets tell them of the heroes of\r\nGreece and Rome, and immense metrical works are devoted to these\r\npersonages, which will beguile the time and drive ennui away from\r\ncastle-halls. These poems form a whole cycle; Alexander is the centre of\r\nit, as Charlemagne is of the cycle of France, and Arthur of the cycle of\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\nThe poets who write about these famous warriors endeavour to satisfy at\r\nonce the contradictory tastes of their patrons for marvels and for\r\ntruth. Their works are a collection of attested prodigies. They are\r\nunanimous in putting aside Homer's story, which does not contain enough\r\nmiracles to please them, and, being in consequence little disposed to\r\nleniency, they reject the whole of it as apocryphal. I confess, says one\r\nof them, that Homer was a \"marvellous clerk,\" but his tales must not be\r\nbelieved: \"For well we know, past any doubt, that he was born more than\r\na hundred years after the great host was gathered together.\"[173]\r\n\r\nBut the worst forger of Alexandria obtains the confidence of our poets;\r\nthey read with admiration in old manuscripts a journal of the siege of\r\nTroy, and the old manuscripts declare the author of this valuable\r\ndocument to be Dares the Phrygian. The work has its counterpart executed\r\nin the Grecian camp by Dictys of Crete. No doubt crosses their mind;\r\nhere is authenticity and truth, here are documents to be trusted; and\r\nhow interesting they are, how curious! the very journal of an\r\neye-witness; truth and wonder made into one.\r\n\r\nFor Alexander they have a no less precious text: the\r\nPseudo-Callisthenes, composed in Greek at Alexandria, of which a Latin\r\nversion of the fourth century still exists. They are all the better\r\ndisposed towards it that it is a long tissue of marvels and fabulous\r\nadventures.[174] For the history of Thebes they are obliged to content\r\nthemselves with Statius, and for that of Rome with Virgil, that same\r\nVirgil who became by degrees, in mediaeval legends, an enchanter, the\r\nMerlin of the cycle of Rome. He had, they believed, some weird\r\nconnection with the powers of darkness; for he had visited them and\r\ndescribed in his \"AEneid\" their place of abode: no one was surprised at\r\nseeing Dante take him for a guide.\r\n\r\nWhat these poets wished for was a certificate of authenticity at\r\nstarting. Once they had it, they took no further trouble; it was their\r\npassport; and with a well-worded passport one can go a long way. After\r\nhaving blamed Homer and appealed to Dares, they felt themselves above\r\nsuspicion, laid hands on all they could, and invented in their turn.\r\nHere is, for example, an episode in the romance of Alexander, a story of\r\nmaidens in a forest, who sink underground in winter and reappear in\r\nspring in the shape of flowers: it will be vainly sought for in\r\nCallisthenes; it is of Eastern origin, and is found in Edrisi. For want\r\nof better, and to avoid the trouble of naming names, the authors will\r\nsometimes refer their public to \"Latin books,\" and such was the renown\r\nof Rome that the reader asked nothing more.\r\n\r\nNo need to add that manners and dresses were scarcely better observed\r\nthan probability. Everything in these poems was really _translated_; not\r\nonly the language of the ancients, but their raiment, their\r\ncivilisation, their ideas. Venus becomes a princess; the heroes are\r\nknights, and their costumes are so much in the fashion of the day that\r\nthey serve us to date the poems. The miniatures conform to the tale;\r\ntonsured monks bear Achilles to the grave; they carry tapers in their\r\nhands. Queen Penthesilea, \"doughty and bold, and beautiful and\r\nvirtuous,\" rides astride, her heels armed with huge red spurs.[175]\r\nOedipus is dubbed a knight; AEneas takes counsel of his \"barons.\" This\r\nmanner of representing antiquity lasted till the Renaissance; and till\r\nmuch later, on the stage. Under Louis XIV., Augustus wore a perruque\r\n\"in-folio\"; and in the last century Mrs. Hartley played Cleopatra in\r\n_paniers_ on the English stage.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with these ideas were written in French, for the benefit\r\nof the conquerors of England, such tales as the immense \"Roman de\r\nTroie,\" by Benoit de Sainte-More, in which is related, for the first\r\ntime in any modern language, the story of Troilus and Cressida; the\r\n\"Roman de Thebes,\" written about 1150; that of \"Eneas,\" composed during\r\nthe same period; the History of Alexander, or the \"Roman de toute\r\nChevalerie,\" a vast compilation, one of the longest and dullest that be,\r\nwritten in the beginning of the thirteenth century by Eustace or Thomas\r\nof Kent; the Romance of \"Ipomedon,\" and the Romance of \"Prothesilaus,\"\r\nby Hue of Rotelande, composed before 1191; and many others besides[176]:\r\nall romances destined to people of leisure, delighting in long\r\ndescriptions, in prodigious adventures, in enchantments, in\r\ntransformations, in marvels. Alexander converses with trees who foretell\r\nthe future to him; he drinks from the fountain of youth; he gets into a\r\nglass barrel lighted by lamps, and is let down to the bottom of the sea,\r\nwhere he watches the gambols of marine monsters; his army is attacked by\r\nwild beasts unaffrighted by flames, that squat in the midst of the fires\r\nintended to scare them away. He places the corpse of the admiral who\r\ncommanded at Babylon in an iron coffin, that four loadstones hold to the\r\nvault. The authors give their imagination full scope; their romances are\r\noperas; at every page we behold a marvel and a change of scene; here we\r\nhave the clouds of heaven, there the depths of the sea. I write of these\r\nmore than I believe, \"equidem plura transcribo quam credo,\" Quintus\r\nCurtius had already said.[177]\r\n\r\nJust as they had curiously inspected their new domains, appropriating to\r\nthemselves as much land as possible, so the conquerors inspected the\r\nliteratures of their new compatriots. If, as will be seen, they drew\r\nlittle from the Saxon, it is not because they were absolutely ignorant\r\nof it, but because they never could well understand its genius. Amongst\r\nthe different races with which they now found themselves in contact,\r\nthey were at once attracted by intellectual sympathy to the Celtic,\r\nwhose mind resembled their own. Alexander had been an amusement, Arthur\r\nbecame a passion. To the Anglo-Norman singers are due the most ancient\r\nand beautiful poems of the Briton cycle that have come down to us.\r\n\r\nIn the \"matter\" of France, the heroic valour of the defenders of the\r\ncountry forms the principal interest of the stories; in the matter of\r\nRome, the \"mirabilia\"; and, in the matter of Britain, love. We are\r\nfarther and farther removed from Beowulf.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Conquest a quantity of legends and tales were current\r\nconcerning the Celtic heroes of Britain, some of whom were quite\r\nindependent of Arthur; nevertheless all ended by being grouped about\r\nhim, for he was the natural centre of all this literature: \"The Welsh\r\nhave never ceased to rave about him up to our day,\" wrote the grave\r\nWilliam of Malmesbury in the century after the Conquest; he was a true\r\nhero, and deserved something better than the \"vain fancies of dreamers.\"\r\nWilliam obviously was not under the spell of Arthurian legends.[178]\r\n\r\nWales, Brittany, and Cornwall were the centres where these legends had\r\ndeveloped; the Briton harpists had, by the beauty of their tales, and\r\nthe sweetness of their music, early acquired a great reputation. It was\r\na recommendation for a minstrel to be able to state that he was a\r\nBriton, and some usurped this title, as does Renard the fox, in the\r\n\"Roman de Renart.\"[179]\r\n\r\nOne thing, however, was lacking for a time to the complete success of\r\nthe Arthurian epic: the stamp of authenticity, the Latin starting-point.\r\nAn Anglo-Norman clerk furnished it, and bestowed upon this literature\r\nthe Dares it needed. Professional historians were silent, or nearly so,\r\nrespecting Arthur; Gildas, in the sixth century, never mentions him;\r\nNennius, in the tenth, only devotes a few lines to him.[180] Geoffrey of\r\nMonmouth makes up for this deficiency.[181]\r\n\r\nHis predecessors knew nothing, he knows everything; his British\r\ngenealogies are precise, his narratives are detailed, his enumerations\r\ncomplete. The mist had lifted, and the series of these kings about whom\r\nso many charming legends were afloat now appeared as clear as the\r\nsuccession of the Roman emperors. In their turn they present themselves\r\nwith the authority conferred at that time in the world by great Latin\r\nbooks. They ceased to be the unacknowledged children of anybody's fancy;\r\nthey had to own them, not some stray minstrel, but a personage of\r\nimportance, known to the king of the land, who was to become bishop of\r\nSt. Asaph, and be a witness at the peace of 1153, between Stephen of\r\nBlois and the future Henry II. In 1139, the \"Historia Regum Britanniae\"\r\nhad appeared, and copies began to circulate. Henry of Huntingdon,\r\npassing at the Abbey of Bec, in Normandy, in the month of January of\r\nthat year, finds one, and is filled with astonishment. \"Never,\" writes\r\nhe to one of his friends, \"had I been able to obtain any information,\r\noral or written, on the kings from Brutus to Caesar.... But to my\r\namazement I have just discovered--stupens inveni--a narrative of these\r\ntimes.\"[182] It was Geoffrey's book.\r\n\r\nThe better to establish his authority, Geoffrey himself had been careful\r\nto appeal to a mysterious source, a certain book of which no trace has\r\never been found, and which he pretends was given him by his friend\r\nWalter, Archdeacon of Oxford. Armed with this proof of authenticity,\r\nwhich no one could contest, he ends his history by a half-serious,\r\nhalf-joking challenge to the professional chroniclers of his time. \"I\r\nforbid William of Malmesbury and Henry of Huntingdon to speak of the\r\nBritish kings, seeing that they have never had in their hands the book\r\nWalter, Archdeacon of Oxford, brought me from Brittany.\" Cervantes never\r\nspoke with more gravity of Cid Hamet-ben-Engeli.\r\n\r\nSuch a book could not fail of success; it had a prodigious fame. Some\r\nhistorians lodged protests; they might as well have protested against\r\nDares. Gerald de Barry cried out it was an imposture; and William of\r\nNewbury inveighed against the impudence of \"a writer called Geoffrey,\"\r\nwho had made \"Arthur's little finger bigger than Alexander's back.\"[183]\r\nIn vain; copies of the \"Historia Regum\" multiplied to such an extent\r\nthat the British Museum alone now possesses thirty-four of them. The\r\nappointed chronicler of the Angevin kings, Wace, translated it into\r\nFrench about 1155, with the addition of several legends omitted by\r\nGeoffrey, that of the Round Table among others.[184] It was turned into\r\nLatin verse, into French alexandrines, into Welsh prose; no honour was\r\ndenied it. From this time dates the literary fortune of Arthur, Merlin,\r\nMorgan the fairy, Percival, Tristan and Iseult, Lancelot and Guinevere,\r\nwhose deeds and loves have been sung from century to century, down to\r\nthe day of Shakespeare, of Swinburne, and Tennyson.\r\n\r\nThe finest poems the Middle Ages devoted to them were written on English\r\nground, and especially the most charming of all, dedicated to that\r\nTristan,[185] whom Dante places by Helen of Troy in the group of\r\nlovers: \"I beheld Helen, who caused such years of woe, and I saw great\r\nAchilles ... Paris and Tristan.\"[186]\r\n\r\nTristan's youth was spent in a castle of Leonois, by the sea. One day a\r\nNorwegian vessel, laden with stuffs and with hunting-birds, brings to\r\nbefore the walls. Tristan comes to buy falcons; he lingers to play chess\r\nwith the merchants; the anchor is weighed, and Tristan is borne off in\r\nthe ship. A storm drives the vessel on the coast of Cornwall, and the\r\nyouth is conducted before King Marc. Harpers were playing; Tristan\r\nremembers Briton lays; he takes the harp, and so sweet is his music that\r\n\"many a courtier remains there, forgetting his very name.\"[187] Marc\r\n(who turns out to be his uncle) takes a fancy to him, and dubs him\r\nknight. \"Should any one,\" says the author of one of the versions of\r\nTristan, \"inquire of me concerning the dress of the knights, I will tell\r\nhim in a few words; it was composed of four stuffs: courage, richness,\r\nskill, and courtesy.\"\r\n\r\nMorolt, the giant, comes to claim a tribute of sixty youths and maidens,\r\nin the name of the king of Ireland. They were proceeding to select\r\nthese victims, when Tristan challenges the giant and kills him; but he\r\nis wounded by a poisoned weapon, and, day by day, death draws nearer. No\r\none can cure this poison except the queen of Ireland, sister of the dead\r\nman. Tristan, disguised as a poor harper, has himself put on a bark and\r\narrives in Dublin, where the queen heals him. The queen had a daughter,\r\nIseult, with fair hair; she begs the harper to instruct the young girl.\r\nIseult becomes perfect: \"She can both read and write, she composes\r\nepistles and songs; above all, she knows many [Briton] lays. She is\r\nsought after for her musical talent, no less than for her beauty, a\r\nsilent and still sweeter music that through the eyes insinuated itself\r\ninto the heart.\" All her life she remembered the teaching of Tristan,\r\nand in her sorrows had recourse to the consoling power of music. When\r\nsitting alone and sad, she would sing \"a touching song of love,\" on the\r\nmisfortunes of Guiron, killed for the sake of his lady. This lay \"she\r\nsings sweetly, the voice accords with the harp, the hands are beautiful,\r\nthe lay is fine, sweet the voice and low the tone.\"[188]\r\n\r\nTristan's task being accomplished, he returns to Cornwall. One day a\r\nswallow drops at the feet of King Marc a golden hair, so soft and\r\nbrilliant, so lovable, that the king swears to marry no other woman but\r\nher of the golden hair.[189] Tristan starts in quest of the woman. The\r\nwoman is Iseult; he brings her to Cornwall. While at sea the two young\r\npeople swallow by mistake an enchanted draught, a \"boivre\" destined for\r\nMarc and his betrothed, which had the virtue of producing a passion that\r\nonly death could end. The poison slowly takes effect; their sentiments\r\nalter. \"All that I know troubles me, and all I see pains me,\" says\r\nIseult. \"The sky, the sea, my own self oppresses me. She bent forward,\r\nand leant her arm on Tristan's shoulder: it was her first caress. Her\r\neyes filled with repressed tears; her bosom heaved, her lips quivered,\r\nand her head remained bent.\"\r\n\r\nThe marriage takes place. Marc adores the queen, but she thinks only of\r\nTristan. Marc is warned, and exiles Tristan, who, in the course of his\r\nadventures, receives a present of a wonderful dog. This dog wore a bell\r\non his neck, the sound of which, so sweet it was, caused all sorrow to\r\nbe forgotten. He sends the dog to Iseult, who, listening to the bell,\r\nfinds that her grief fades from her memory; and she removes the collar,\r\nunwilling to hear and to forget.\r\n\r\nIseult is at last repudiated, and Tristan bears her off by lonely paths,\r\nthrough forest depths, until they reach a grotto of green marble carved\r\nby giants in ages past. An aperture at the top let in the light, lindens\r\nshaded the entrance, a rill trickled over the grass, flowers scented the\r\nair, birds sang in the branches. Here nothing more existed for them save\r\nlove. \"Nor till the might of August\"--thought the old poet, and said a\r\nmore recent one--\r\n\r\n    Nor till the might of August overhead\r\n    Weighed on the world, was yet one roseleaf shed\r\n    Of all their joys warm coronal, nor aught\r\n    Touched them in passing ever with a thought\r\n    That ever this might end on any day,\r\n    Or any night not love them where they lay;\r\n    But like a babbling tale of barren breath\r\n    Seemed all report and rumour held of death,\r\n    And a false bruit the legend tear impearled\r\n    That such a thing as change was in the world.[190]\r\n\r\nKing Marc's hunt passes by the grotto; through an opening at the top he\r\nchances to perceive her who had been \"the springtide of his life, fairer\r\nthan ever at this moment ... her mouth, her brow, every feature was so\r\nfull of charm that Marc was fascinated, and, seized with longing, would\r\nfain on that face have pressed a kiss.... A wreath of clover was woven\r\nin her unbound locks.... When he saw that the sun overhead let fall\r\nthrough the crevice a ray of light on Iseult's face, he feared lest her\r\nhue should suffer. He took grass and flowers and foliage with which he\r\nclosed the aperture, then blessing the lady, he commended her to God,\r\nand departed weeping.\"[191]\r\n\r\nOnce more the lovers are separated, this time for ever. Years pass;\r\nTristan has made himself famous by his exploits. He is without news of\r\nhis love, doubtless forgotten. He marries another Iseult, and lives with\r\nher near Penmarch in Brittany. Wounded to death in a fight, he might be\r\ncured by the queen of Cornwall, and in spite of his marriage, and the\r\ntime that has elapsed, he sends her word to leave all and join him. If\r\nIseult comes, the ship is to have a white sail; if she refuses, a black\r\none. Iseult still loves. At the first word she puts to sea; but storms\r\narise, then follows a dead calm; Tristan feels life ebb from him with\r\nhope. At last the vessel appears, and Tristan's wife sees it from the\r\nshore with its white sail. She had overheard Tristan's message; she\r\nreturns, lies, and announces the arrival of a black sail. Tristan tears\r\nthe bandage from his wound and dies. When the true Iseult lands, the\r\nknell is tolling from the steeples of Brittany; she rushes in, finds\r\nher lover's corpse already cold, and expires beside him. They were\r\nburied in the same church at Carhaix, one at each end; out of one of the\r\ntombs grew a vine, and out of the other grew a rose, and the branches,\r\ncreeping along the pillars, interlaced under the vaulted roof. The magic\r\ndraught thus proved stronger than death.\r\n\r\nIn the ancient epic poems, love was nothing, here it is everything; and\r\nwoman, who had no part, now plays the first; warlike feats are\r\nhenceforth only a means to win her heart. Grass has grown over the\r\nbloody vale of Roncevaux, which is now enamelled with flowers; Roland's\r\nlove, Durandal, has ascended to heaven, and will return no more. The new\r\npoets are the exact antithesis of the former ones. Religion, virtue,\r\ncountry, now count for nothing; love defies, nay more, replaces them.\r\nMarc's friends, who warn him, are traitors and felons, vowed to scorn\r\nand hate, as were formerly Gannelons, who betrayed fair France. To be in\r\nlove is to be worthy of heaven, is to be a saint, and to practise\r\nvirtue. This theory, put forward in the twelfth century by the singers\r\nof the British cycle, has survived, and will be found again in the\r\n\"Astree,\" in Byron, and in Musset.\r\n\r\nThese tales multiply, and their worldly, courteous, amorous character\r\nbecomes more and more predominant. Woman already plays the part that she\r\nplays in the novels of yesterday. A glance opens Paradise to Arthur's\r\nknights; they find in a smile all the magic which it pleases us, the\r\nliving of to-day, to discover there. A trite word of farewell from the\r\nwoman they cherish is transformed by their imagination, and they keep it\r\nin their hearts as a talisman. Who has not cherished similar talismans?\r\nLancelot recalls the past to queen Guinevere: \"And you said, God be with\r\nyou, fair, gentle friend! Never since have these words left my heart. It\r\nis these words that shall make me a _preux_, if ever I am one; for\r\nnever since was I in such great peril but that I remembered these words.\r\nThey have comforted me in all my sorrows; these words have kept and\r\nguarded me from all danger; these words have fed me when hungry and made\r\nme wealthy when poor.\"\r\n\r\n\"By my troth,\" said the queen, \"those words were happily spoken, and\r\nblessed be God who caused me to speak them. But I did not put into them\r\nas much as you saw, and to many a knight have I spoken the same without\r\nthinking of more than what they plainly bear.\"[192]\r\n\r\nAfter being a saint, the beloved object becomes a goddess; her wishes\r\nare decrees, her mysterious caprices are laws which must not even be\r\nquestioned; harder rules of love are from year to year imposed on the\r\nheroes; they are expected to turn pale at the sight of their mistress;\r\nLancelot espying a hair of Guinevere well-nigh faints; they observe the\r\nthirty-one regulations laid down by Andre le Chapelain, to guide the\r\nperfect lover.[193] After having been first an accessory, then an\r\nirresistible passion, love, that the poets think to magnify, will soon\r\nbe nothing but a ceremonial. From the time of Lancelot we border on\r\nfolly; military honour no longer counts for the hero; Guinevere out of\r\ncaprice orders Lancelot to behave \"his worst\"; without hesitating or\r\ncomprehending he obeys, and covers himself with shame. Each successive\r\nromance writer goes a step farther, and makes new additions; we come to\r\nimmense compositions, to strings of adventures without any visible link;\r\nto heroes so uniformly wonderful that they cease to inspire any interest\r\nwhatever. Tristan's rose-bush twined itself around the pillars, the\r\npillars are lacking now, and the clusters of flowers trail on the\r\nground. Tristan was a harbinger of Musset; Guinevere gives us a desire\r\nfor a Cervantes.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the minstrels of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries enjoy\r\ntheir success and their fame; their number increases; they are welcomed\r\nin the castles, hearkened to in the towns; their tales are copied in\r\nmanuscripts, more and more magnificently painted. They celebrate, in\r\nEngland as in France, Gauvain, \"le chevalier aux demoiselles,\" Ivain,\r\n\"le chevalier au lion\"; Merlin, Joseph of Arimathea, Percival and the\r\nquest of the mysterious Graal, and all the rest of the Round Table\r\nheroes.[194]\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nThey have also shorter narratives in prose and verse, the subject of\r\nwhich is generally love, drawn from French, Latin, Greek, and even\r\nHindu legends,[195] stories like those of Amis and Amile, of Floire and\r\nBlanchefleur, lays like those of Marie de France.[196] Marie was Norman,\r\nand lived in the time of Henry II., to whom she dedicated her poems.\r\nThey are mostly graceful love-tales, sweetly told, without affectation\r\nor effort, and derived from Celtic originals, some being of Armorican\r\nand some of Welsh descent. Several are devoted to Tristan and other\r\nArthurian knights. In the lay of the Ash, Marie tells a story of female\r\nvirtue, the main incidents of which will be found again later in the\r\ntale of Griselda. Her lay of the Two Lovers would have delighted Musset:\r\n\r\n\"Truth is that in Neustria, which we call Normandy,\" lived once a\r\nnobleman who had a beautiful daughter; every one asked her in marriage,\r\nbut he always refused, so as not to part from her. At last he declared\r\nhe would give his daughter to the man who could carry her to the top of\r\nthe mountain. All tried, but all failed.\r\n\r\nA young count falls in love with her, and is loved again. She sends him\r\nto an old aunt of hers, who lives at Salerno, and will give him certain\r\npotions to increase his strength. He does all she bids him. On the day\r\nappointed, provided with a draught to swallow during the trial, he takes\r\nthe fair maiden in his arms. She had fasted for many days so as to weigh\r\nless, and had put on an exceedingly light garment: \"Except her shift, no\r\nother stuff she wore\";\r\n\r\n    N'ot drap vestu fors la chemise.\r\n\r\nHe climbs half-way, then begins to flag; but he wishes to owe everything\r\nto his energy, and, without drinking, slowly continues to ascend. He\r\nreaches the top and falls dead. The young girl flings away the now\r\nuseless flask, which breaks; and since then the mountain herbs moistened\r\nby the potion have wonderful healing powers. She looks at her lover and\r\ndies, like the Simonne of Boccaccio and of Musset. They were buried on\r\nthe mountain, where has since been built \"the priory of the Two Lovers.\"\r\n\r\nThe rulers of England delight in still shorter poems, but again on the\r\nsame subject: love. Like the rest of the French, they have an innate\r\nfondness for a kind of literature unknown to their new compatriots:\r\nnamely, _chansons_. They composed a great number of them, and listened\r\nto many more of all sorts. The subjects of the kings of England became\r\nfamiliar with every variety of the kind; for the Angevin princes now\r\npossessed such wide domains that the sources of French poetry, poetry of\r\nthe North, poetry of the South, lyrical poetry of Poictou and of Maine,\r\ngushed forth in the very heart of their empire.[197]\r\n\r\nTheir English subjects got acquainted with these poems in two ways:\r\nfirstly, because many of those songs were sung in the island; secondly,\r\nbecause many Englishmen, soldiers, clerks, minstrels, messengers,\r\nfollowed the king and stayed with him in the parts where the main wells\r\nand fountains of the French _chanson_ happened to be.[198] They became\r\nthus familiarised with the \"reverdies,\" May songs, which celebrate\r\nspringtime, flowers, and free loves; \"carols,\" or dancing songs;\r\n\"pastourelles,\" the wise or foolish heroines of which are shepherdesses;\r\n\"disputoisons\" or debates, to which kind belongs the well-known song of\r\n\"transformations\" introduced by Mistral in his \"Mireio,\" and set to\r\nmusic by Gounod; \"aube\" songs, telling the complaint of lovers, parted\r\nby dawn, and in which, long before Shakespeare, the Juliets of the time\r\nof Henry II. said to their Romeos:\r\n\r\n                    It is not yet near day;\r\n    It was the nightingale and not the lark.\r\n\r\n    Il n'est mie jors, saverouze au cors gent,\r\n    Si m'ait amors, l'aloete nos ment.[199]\r\n\r\n\"It is not yet near day, my sweet one; love be my help, the lark lies.\"\r\nIn these songs, the women are slight and lithe; they are more gentle\r\nthan doves; their faces are all pink and white: \"If the flowers of the\r\nhawthorn were united to the rose, not more delicate would be their\r\ncolour than that on my lady's clear face.\"\r\n\r\n    Si les flurs d[el] albespine\r\n    Fuissent a roses assis,\r\n    N'en ferunt colur plus fine\r\n    Ke n'ad ma dame au cler vis.[200]\r\n\r\nWith these songs, Love ventures out of castles; we find him \"in cellars,\r\nor in lofts under the hay.\"[201] He steals even into churches, and a\r\nsermon that has come down to us, preached in England in the thirteenth\r\ncentury, has for text, instead of a verse of Scripture, a verse of a\r\nFrench song: \"Fair Alice rose at morn, clothed and adorned her body; an\r\norchard she went in, five flowers there she found, a wreath she made\r\nwith them of blooming roses; for God's sake, get you gone, you who do\r\nnot love!\" and with meek gravity the preacher goes on: Belle Alice is or\r\nmight be the Virgin Mary; \"what are those flowers,\" if not \"faith, hope,\r\ncharity, virginity, humility?\"[202] The idea of turning worldly songs\r\nand music to religious ends is not, as we see, one of yesterday.\r\n\r\nTristan has led us very far from Beowulf, and fair Alice leads us still\r\nfarther from the mariner and exile of Anglo-Saxon literature. To sum up\r\nin a word which will show the difference between the first and second\r\nperiod: on the lips of the conquerors of Hastings, odes have become\r\n_chansons_.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nNothing comes so near ridicule as extreme sentiments, and no men had the\r\nsense of the ridiculous to a higher degree than the new rulers of the\r\nEnglish country. At the same time with their chivalrous literature, they\r\nhad a mocking one. They did not wait for Cervantes to begin laughing;\r\nthese variable and many-sided beings sneered at high-flown sentiments\r\nand experienced them too. They sang the Song of Roland, and read with\r\ndelight a romance in which the great emperor is represented strutting\r\nabout before his barons, his crown on his head and his sword in his\r\nhand, asking the queen if he is not the most admirable prince in the\r\nworld.[203] To his surprise, the queen says no, there is a better, there\r\nis King Hugon, emperor of Greece and of Constantinople. Charlemagne\r\nwishes to verify on the spot, and pledges his word that he will cut the\r\nqueen's head off if she has not spoken truth. He mounts a donkey; the\r\ntwelve peers follow his example, and in this fashion the flower of\r\nFrench chivalry takes its way to the East.\r\n\r\nAt Constantinople, the city of marvels, which had not yet become the\r\ncity of mosques, but was still enriched by the spoils of Athens and\r\nRome, where St. Sophia shone with all the glory of its mosaics intact,\r\nwhere the palace of the emperors dazzled the sight with its gold and its\r\nstatues, the French princes could scarcely believe their eyes. At every\r\nstep they were startled by some fresh wonder; here bronze children\r\nblowing horns; there a revolving hall set in motion by the sea-breeze;\r\nelsewhere a carbuncle which illuminated apartments at night. The queen\r\nmight possibly have spoken truth. Evening draws on, they drink deep,\r\nand, excited by their potations, indulge in _gabs_, or boasts, that are\r\noverheard by a spy, and carefully noted. Ogier the Dane will uproot the\r\npillar which supports the whole palace; Aimer will make himself\r\ninvisible and knock the emperor's head on the table; Roland will sound\r\nhis horn so loudly that the gates of the town will be forced open.\r\nThreatened and insulted by his guests, Hugon declares they shall either\r\naccomplish their _gabs_ or pay for their lies with their heads.\r\n\r\nThis is too much, and the author changes his tone. Will God permit the\r\nconfusion of the emperor of the Franks, however well deserved it be?\r\n\"Vivat qui Francos diligit Christus!\" was already written in the Salic\r\nlaw: Christ continues to love the Franks. He takes their cause into His\r\nown hands, not because of their deserts but because they are Franks. By\r\na miracle, one after another, the _gabs_ are realised; Hugon\r\nacknowledges the superiority of Charles, who returns to France, enriches\r\nSt. Denis with incomparable relics, and forgives the queen. This poem is\r\nexactly contemporaneous with the Song of Roland.\r\n\r\nBut there is better still, and the comedy is much more general in the\r\nfamous \"Roman de Renart.\"[204] This romance, of which the branches are\r\nof various epochs and by various authors, was composed partly in the\r\ncontinental estates of the kings of England, partly in the France of\r\nFrench kings. It was built up, part after part, during several\r\ncenturies, beginning with the twelfth: built like a cathedral, each\r\nauthor adding a wing, a tower, a belfry, a steeple; without caring, most\r\nof the time, to make known his name; so that the poem has come down to\r\nus, like the poems in stone of the architects, almost anonymously, the\r\nwork of every one, an expression and outcome of the popular mind.\r\n\r\nFor many Frenchmen of ancient France, a _chanson_ was a sufficient\r\nrevenge, or at least served as a temporary one. So much pleasure was\r\ntaken in it, that by such means the tyranny of the ruler was forgotten.\r\nOn more than one occasion where in other countries a riot would have\r\nbeen unavoidable, in France a song has sufficed; discontent, thus\r\nattenuated, no longer rose to fury. More than one jacquerie has been\r\ndelayed, if not averted, by the \"Roman de Renart.\"\r\n\r\nIn this ample comedy everybody has a part to perform; everybody and\r\neverything is in turn laughed at: the king, the nobles, the citizens,\r\nthe Pope, the pilgrims, the monks, every belief and every custom,[205]\r\nreligion, and justice, the powerful, the rich, the hypocrites, the\r\nsimple-minded; and, so that nothing shall be wanting, the author scoffs\r\nat himself and his caste; he knows its failings, points them out and\r\nlaughs at them. The tone is heroi-comical: for the jest to take effect,\r\nthe contrast must be clearly visible, and we should keep in view the\r\nimportance of principles and the majesty of kings:\r\n\r\n\"Lordings, you have heard many a tale, related by many a tale-teller,\r\nhow Paris ravished Helen, the trouble it brought him, and the sorrow!...\r\nalso gests and fabliaux; but never did you hear of the war--such a hard\r\none it was, and of such great import--between Renard and Ysengrin.\"[206]\r\n\r\nThe personages are animals; their sentiments are human; king lion swears\r\nlike a man[207]; but the way in which they sit, or stand, or move, is\r\nthat of their species. Every motion of theirs is observed with that\r\ncorrectness of eye which is always found in early times among animal\r\npainters, long before painters of the human figure rise to the same\r\nexcellence. There are perfect descriptions of Ysengrin, who feels very\r\nfoolish after a rebuke of the king's, and \"sits with his tail between\r\nhis legs\"; of the cock, monarch of the barn-yard; of Tybert the cat; of\r\nTardif the slug; of Espinar the hedgehog; of Bruin the bear; of Roonel\r\nthe mastiff; of Couard the hare; of Noble the lion. The arrival of a\r\nprocession of hens at Court is an excellent scene of comedy.\r\n\r\n\"Sir Chanteclair, the cock, and Pinte, who lays the big eggs, and Noire,\r\nand Blanche, and la Roussette, were dragging a cart with drawn curtains.\r\nA hen lay in it prostrate.... Renard had so maltreated her, and so\r\npulled her about with his teeth, that her thigh was broken, and a wing\r\ntorn off her side.\"[208]\r\n\r\nPinte, moved to tears and ready to faint, like Esther before Ahasuerus,\r\ntells the king her woes. She had five brothers, Renard has devoured\r\nevery one; she had five sisters, but \"only one has Renard spared; all\r\nthe rest have passed through his jaws. And you, who lie there on your\r\nbier, my sweet sister, my dear friend, how plump and tender you were!\r\nWhat will become of your poor unfortunate sister?\"[209] She is very near\r\nadding in Racine's words: \"Mes filles, soutenez votre reine eperdue!\"\r\nAnyhow, she faints.\r\n\r\n\"The unfortunate Pinte thereupon fainted and fell on the pavement; and\r\nso did the others, all at once. To assist the four ladies all jumped\r\nfrom their stools, dog and wolf and other beasts, and threw water on\r\ntheir brows.\"[210]\r\n\r\nThe king is quite upset by so moving a sight: \"His head out of anger he\r\nshakes; never was so bold a beast, a bear be it or a boar, who does not\r\nfear when their lord sighs and howls. So much afraid was Couard the hare\r\nthat for two days he had the fever; all the Court shakes together, the\r\nboldest for dread tremble. He, in his wrath, raises his tail, and is\r\nmoved with such pangs that the roar fills the house; and then this was\r\nhis speech: 'Lady Pinte,' the emperor said, 'upon my father's\r\nsoul'\"[211]....\r\n\r\nHereupon follows a solemn promise, couched in the most impressive words,\r\nthat the traitor shall be punished; which will make all the more\r\nnoticeable the utter defeat which verbose royalty soon afterward\r\nsuffers. Renard worsts the king's messengers; Bruin the bear has his\r\nnose torn off; Tybert the cat loses half his tail; Renard jeers at them,\r\nat the king, and at the Court. And all through the story he triumphs\r\nover Ysengrin, as Panurge over Dindenault, Scapin over Geronte, and\r\nFigaro over Bridoison. Renard is the first of the family; he is such a\r\nnatural and spontaneous creation of the French mind that we see him\r\nreappear from century to century, the same character under different\r\nnames.\r\n\r\nOne last point to be noted is the impression of open air given by nearly\r\nall the branches of this romance, in spite of the brevity of the\r\ndescriptions. We are in the fields, by the hedges, following the roads\r\nand the footpaths; the moors are covered with heather; the rocks are\r\ncrowned by oaken copse, the roads are lined with hawthorn, cabbages\r\ndisplay in the gardens the heavy mass of their clustering leaves. We see\r\nwith regret the moment when \"the sweet time of summer declines.\" Winter\r\ndraws near, a north wind blows over the paths leading to the sea. Renard\r\n\"dedenz sa tour\" of Maupertuis lights a great wood fire, and, while his\r\nlittle ones jump for joy, grills slices of eels on the embers.\r\n\r\nRenard was popular throughout Europe. In England parts of the romance\r\nwere translated or imitated; superb manuscripts were illustrated for the\r\nlibraries of the nobles; the incidents of this epic were represented in\r\ntapestry, sculptured on church stalls, painted on the margins of English\r\nmissals. At the Renaissance Caxton, with his Westminster presses,\r\nprinted a Renard in prose.[212]\r\n\r\nAbove, below, around these greater works, swarms the innumerable legion\r\nof satirical fabliaux and laughable tales. They, too, cross the sea,\r\nslight, imperceptible, wandering, thus continuing those migrations so\r\ndifficult to trace, the laws of which learned men of all nations have\r\nvainly sought to discover. They follow all roads; nothing stops them.\r\nPass the mountains and you will find them; cross the sea and they have\r\npreceded you; they spring from the earth; they fall from heaven; the\r\nbreeze bears them along like pollen, and they go to bloom on other stems\r\nin unknown lands, producing thorny or poisonous or perfumed flowers, and\r\nflowers of every hue. All those varieties of flowers are sometimes found\r\nclustered in unexpected places, on wild mountain sides, along lonely\r\npaths, on the moors of Brittany or Scotland, in royal parks and in\r\nconvent gardens. At the beginning of the seventh century the great Pope\r\nSt. Gregory introduces into his works a number of \"Exempla,\" saying:\r\n\"Some are more incited to the love of the celestial country by\r\nstories--exempla--than by sermons;\"[213] and in the gardens of\r\nmonasteries, after his day, more and more miscellaneous grow the\r\nblossoms. They are gathered and preserved as though in herbals,\r\ncollections are made of them, from which preachers borrow; tales of\r\nmiracles are mixed with others of a less edifying nature.\r\n\r\nStop before the house of this anchoress, secluded from the world, and\r\nabsorbed in pious meditations, a holy and quiet place. An old woman sits\r\nunder the window; the anchoress appears and a conversation begins. Let\r\nus listen; it is a long time since both women have been listened to.\r\nWhat is the subject of their talk? The old woman brings news of the\r\nouter world, relates stories, curious incidents of married and unmarried\r\nlife, tales of wicked wives and wronged husbands. The recluse laughs:\r\n\"os in risus cachinnosque dissolvitur\"; in a word, the old woman amuses\r\nthe anchoress with fabliaux in an embryonic state. This is a most\r\nremarkable though little known example, for we can here observe fabliaux\r\nin a rudimentary stage, and going about in one more, and that a rather\r\nunexpected way. Is the case of this anchoress a unique one? Not at all;\r\nthere was scarcely any recluse at that day, \"vix aliquam inclusarum\r\nhujus temporis,\" without a friendly old woman to sit before her window\r\nand tell her such tales: of which testifies, in the twelfth century,\r\nAelred, abbot of Rievaulx.[214]\r\n\r\nFrom the thirteenth century, another medium of diffusion, a conspicuous\r\nand well-known one, is added to the others: not only minstrels, but\r\nwandering friars now carry tales to all countries; it is one of the ways\r\nthey count on for securing a welcome. Their sermons raise a laugh, the\r\nsuccess of their fables encourages their rivals to imitate them; the\r\nCouncils vainly interfere, and reiterate, until after the Renaissance,\r\nthe prohibition \"to provoke shouts of laughter, after the fashion of\r\nshameless buffoons, by ridiculous stories and old wives' tales.\"[215]\r\nDante had also protested, and Wyclif likewise, without more success than\r\nthe Councils. \"Thus,\" said Dante, \"the ignorant sheep come home from\r\npasture, wind-fed.... Jests and buffooneries are preached.... St.\r\nAnthony's swine fattens by these means, and others, worse than swine,\r\nfatten too.\"[216] But collections succeeded to collections, and room was\r\nfound in them for many a scandalous tale, for that of the Weeping Bitch,\r\nfor example, one of the most travelled of all, as it came from India,\r\nand is found everywhere, in Italy, France, and England, among fabliaux,\r\nin sermons, and even on the stage.[217]\r\n\r\nThe French who were now living in England in large numbers, introduced\r\nthere the taste for merry tales of trickery and funny adventures,\r\nstories of curious mishaps of all kinds; of jealous husbands, duped,\r\nbeaten, and withal perfectly content, and of fit wives for such\r\nhusbands. It already pleased their teasing, mocking minds, fond of\r\ngeneralisations, to make themselves out a vicious race, without faith,\r\ntruth, or honour: it ever was a _gab_ of theirs. The more one protests,\r\nthe more they insist; they adduce proofs and instances; they are\r\nconvinced and finally convince others. In our age of systems, this\r\nmagnifying of the abject side of things has been termed \"realism\"; for\r\nso-called \"realism\" is nothing more. True it is that if the home of\r\ntales is \"not where they are born, but where they are comfortable,\"[218]\r\nFrance was a home for them. They reached there the height of their\r\nprosperity; the turn of mind of which they are the outcome has by no\r\nmeans disappeared; even to-day it is everywhere found, in the public\r\nsquares, in the streets, in the newspapers, theatres, and novels. And it\r\nserves, as it did formerly, to make wholesale condemnations easy, very\r\neasy to judges who may be dazzled by this jugglery of the French mind,\r\nwho look only at the goods exhibited before their eyes, and who scruple\r\nthe less to pass a sentence as they have to deal with a culprit who\r\nconfesses. But judge and culprit both forget that, next to the realism\r\nof the fabliaux, there is the realism of the Song of Roland, not less\r\nreal, perhaps more so; for France has _lived_ by her Song of Roland much\r\nmore than by her merry tales, that song which was sung in many ways and\r\nfor many centuries. Du Guesclin and Corneille both sang it, each one\r\nafter his fashion.\r\n\r\nOn the same table may be found \"La Terre,\" and \"Grandeur et Servitude.\"\r\nIn the same hall, the same minstrel, representing in his own person the\r\nwhole library of the castle, used formerly to relate the shameful tale\r\nof Gombert and the two clerks, juggle with knives, and sing of Roland.\r\n\"I know tales,\" says one, \"I know fabliaux, I can tell fine new\r\n_dits_.... I know the fabliau of the 'Denier' ... and that of Gombert\r\nand dame Erme.... I know how to play with knives, and with the cord and\r\nwith the sling, and every fine game in the world. I can sing at will of\r\nKing Pepin of St. Denis ... of Charlemagne and of Roland, and of Oliver,\r\nwho fought so well; I know of Ogier and of Aymon.\"[219]\r\n\r\nAll this literature went over the Channel with the conquerors. Roland\r\ncame to England, so did Renard, so did Gombert. They contributed to\r\ntransform the mind of the vanquished race, and the vanquished race\r\ncontributed to transform the descendants of the victors.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[153]\r\n\r\n    Thus com lo Engelond | in to Normandies hond;\r\n    And the Normans ne couthe speke tho | bot hor owe speche,\r\n    And speke French as hii dude atom | and hor children dude also teche,\r\n    So that heiemen of this lond | that of hor blod come\r\n    Holdeth alle thulke speche | that hii of hom nome;\r\n    Vor bote a man conne Frenss | me telth of him lute,\r\n    Ac lowe men holdeth to engliss | and to hor owe speche yute.\r\n    Ich wene ther ne beth in al the world | contreyes none\r\n    That ne holdeth to hor owe speche | bote Engelonde one.\r\n\r\nW.

The wealth of this historical literature in the\r\nFrench tongue is greater at first than that of the literature produced\r\nby the subjects of the French kings.

On the value of this Life, see an article by the\r\nsame, \"Romania,\" vol. xi. The slab in the Temple Church is in an\r\nexcellent state of preservation; the image of the earl seems to be a\r\nportrait; the face is that of an old man with many wrinkles; the sword\r\nis out of the scabbard, and held in the right hand; its point is driven\r\nthrough the head of an animal at the feet of the earl.\r\n\r\n[164] Jean de Waurin, who wrote in French prose in the fifteenth century\r\nhis \"Chroniques et anchiennes istoires de la Grant-Bretaigne\" (ed.\r\nHardy, Rolls, 1864 ff.) was a Frenchman of France, who had fought at\r\nAgincourt on the French side.

In both respects, notwithstanding\r\nstorms and struggles, the tradition thus started was continued under his\r\nsuccessors.\r\n\r\nAt no period of the history of England was the union with Rome closer,\r\nand at no time, not even in the Augustan Age of English literature was\r\nthere a larger infusion of Latin ideas. The final consequence of Henry\r\nII.'s quarrel with Thomas Becket was a still more complete submission of\r\nthis prince to the Roman See. John Lackland's fruitless attempts to\r\nreach absolute power resulted in the gift of his domains to St. Peter\r\nand the oath of fealty sworn by him as vassal of the Pope: \"We, John, by\r\nthe grace of God, king of England, lord of Ireland, duke of Normandy,\r\nearl of Anjou, ... Wishing to humiliate ourselves for Him who humiliated\r\nHimself for us even unto death ... freely offer and concede to God and\r\nto our lord Pope Innocent and his Catholic successors, all the kingdom\r\nof England and all the kingdom of Ireland for the remission of our\r\nsins,\"[220] May 15, 1213.\r\n\r\nFrom the day after Hastings the Church is seen establishing herself on\r\nfirm basis in the country; she receives as many, and even more domains\r\nthan the companions of the Conqueror. In the county of Dorset, for\r\ninstance, it appears from Domesday that \"the Church with her vassals and\r\ndependents enjoyed more than a third of the whole county, and that her\r\npatrimony was greater than that of all the Barons and greater feudalists\r\ncombined.\"[221]\r\n\r\nThe religious foundations are innumerable, especially at the beginning;\r\nthey decrease as the time of the Renaissance draws nearer. Four hundred\r\nand eighteen are counted from William Rufus to John, a period of one\r\nhundred years; one hundred and thirty-nine during the three following\r\nreigns: a hundred and eight years; twenty-three in the fourteenth\r\ncentury, and only three in the fifteenth.[222]\r\n\r\nThis number of monasteries necessitated considerable intercourse with\r\nRome; many of the monks, often the abbots, were Italian or French; they\r\nhad suits in the court of Rome, they laid before the Pope at Rome, and\r\nlater at Avignon, their spiritual and temporal difficulties; the most\r\nimportant abbeys were \"exempt,\" that is to say, under the direct\r\njurisdiction of the Pope without passing through the local episcopal\r\nauthority. This was the case with St. Augustine of Canterbury, St.\r\nAlbans, St. Edmund's, Waltham, Evesham, Westminster, &c. The clergy of\r\nEngland had its eyes constantly turned Romewards.\r\n\r\nThis clergy was very numerous; in the thirteenth century its ranks were\r\nswelled by the arrival of the mendicant friars: Franciscans and\r\nDominicans, the latter representing more especially doctrine, and the\r\nformer practice. The Dominicans expound dogmas, fight heresy, and\r\nfurnish the papacy with its Grand Inquisitors[223]; the Franciscans do\r\ncharitable works, nurse lepers and wretches in the suburbs of the towns.\r\nAll science that does not tend to the practice of charity is forbidden\r\nthem: \"Charles the Emperor,\" said St. Francis, \"Roland and Oliver, all\r\nthe paladins and men mighty in battle, have pursued the infidels to\r\ndeath, and won their memorable victories at the cost of much toil and\r\nlabour. The holy martyrs died fighting for the faith of Christ. But\r\nthere are in our time, people who by the mere telling of their deeds,\r\nseek honour and glory among men. There are also some among you who like\r\nbetter to preach on the virtues of the saints than to imitate their\r\nlabours.... When thou shalt have a psalter so shalt thou wish for a\r\nbreviary, and when thou shalt have a breviary, thou shalt sit in a chair\r\nlike a great prelate, and say to thy brother: 'Brother, fetch me my\r\nbreviary.'\"[224]\r\n\r\nThirty-two years after their first coming there were in England twelve\r\nhundred and forty-two Franciscans, with forty-nine convents, divided\r\ninto seven custodies: London, York, Cambridge, Bristol, Oxford,\r\nNewcastle, Worcester.[225] \"Your Holiness must know,\" writes Robert\r\nGrosseteste, bishop of Lincoln, to Pope Gregory IX., \"that the friars\r\nilluminate the whole country by the light of their preaching and\r\nteaching. Intercourse with these holy men propagates scorn of the world\r\nand voluntary poverty.... Oh! could your Holiness see how piously and\r\nhumbly the people hasten to hear from them the word of life, to confess\r\ntheir sins, and learn the rules of good conduct!...\"[226] Such was the\r\nbeginning; what followed was far from resembling it. The point to be\r\nremembered is another tie with Rome, represented by these new Orders:\r\neven the troubles that their disorders gave rise to later, their\r\nquarrels with the secular clergy, the monks and the University, the\r\nconstant appeals to the Pope that were a result of these disputes, the\r\nobstinacy with which they endeavoured to form a Church within the\r\nChurch, all tended to increase and multiply the relations between Rome\r\nand England.\r\n\r\nThe English clergy was not only numerous and largely endowed; it was\r\nalso very influential, and played a considerable part in the policy of\r\nthe State. When the Parliament was constituted the clergy occupied many\r\nseats, the king's ministers were usually churchmen; the high Chancellor\r\nwas a prelate.\r\n\r\nThe action of the Latin Church made itself also felt on the nation by\r\nmeans of ecclesiastical tribunals, the powers of which were\r\nconsiderable; all that concerned clerks, or related to faith and\r\nbeliefs, to tithes, to deeds and contracts having a moral character,\r\nwills for instance, came within the jurisdiction of the religious\r\nmagistrate. This justice interfered in the private life of the citizens;\r\nit had an inquisitorial character; it wanted to know if good order\r\nreigned in households, if the husband was faithful and the wife\r\nvirtuous; it cited adulterers to its bar and chastised them. Summoners\r\n(Chaucer's somnours) played the part of spies and public accusers; they\r\nkept themselves well informed on these different matters, were\r\nconstantly on the watch, pried into houses, collected and were supposed\r\nto verify evil reports, and summoned before the ecclesiastical court\r\nthose whom Jane's or Gilote's beauty had turned from the path of\r\nconjugal fidelity. It may be readily imagined that such an institution\r\nafforded full scope for abuses; it could hardly have been otherwise\r\nunless all the summoners had been saints, which they were not; some\r\namong them were known to compound with the guilty for money, to call the\r\ninnocent before the judge in order to gratify personal spite.[227] Their\r\nmisdeeds were well known but not easy to prove; so that Chaucer's\r\nsatires did more to ruin the institution than all the petitions to\r\nParliament. These summoners were also in their own way, mean as that\r\nwas, representatives of the Latin country, of the spiritual power of\r\nRome; they knew it, and made the best of the stray Latin words that had\r\nlodged in their memory; they used them as their shibboleth.\r\n\r\nBishops kept seigneurial retinues, built fortresses[228] and lived in\r\nthem, had their archers and their dogs, hunted, laid siege to towns,\r\nmade war, and only had recourse to excommunication when all other means\r\nof prevailing over their foes had failed. Others among them became\r\nsaints: both in heaven and on earth they held the first rank. Like the\r\nsovereign, they knew, even then, the worth of public opinion; they\r\nbought the goodwill of wandering poets, as that of the press was bought\r\nin the day of Defoe. The itinerant minstrels were the newspapers of the\r\nperiod; they retailed the news and distributed praise or blame; they\r\nacquired over the common people the same influence that \"printed matter\"\r\nhas had in more recent times. Hugh de Nunant, bishop of Coventry,\r\naccuses William de Longchamp, bishop of Ely, and Chancellor of England,\r\nin a letter still extant, of having inspired the verses--one might\r\nalmost say the articles--that minstrels come from France, and paid by\r\nhim, told in public places, \"in plateis,\" not without effect, \"for\r\nalready, according to public opinion, no one in the universe was\r\ncomparable to him.\"[229]\r\n\r\nNothing gives so vivid an impression of the time that has elapsed, and\r\nthe transformation in manners that has occurred, as the sight of that\r\nreligious and warlike tournament of which England was the field under\r\nRichard Coeur-de-Lion, and of which the heroes were all prelates, to\r\nwit: these same William de Longchamp, bishop of Ely, and Hugh de Nunant,\r\nbishop of Coventry; then Hugh de Puiset, bishop of Durham, Geoffrey\r\nPlantagenet, archbishop of York, &c.\r\n\r\nHugh de Puiset, a scion of the de Puisets, viscounts of Chartres,\r\ngrandson of the Conqueror, cousin to King Richard, bishop palatine of\r\nDurham, wears the coat of mail, fortifies his castles, storms those of\r\nhis enemies, builds ships, adds a beautiful \"Lady chapel\" to his\r\ncathedral, and spends the rest of his time in hunting.\r\n\r\nWilliam de Longchamp, his great rival, grandson of a Norman peasant,\r\nbishop of Ely, Chancellor of England, seizes on Lincoln by force, lives\r\nlike a prince, has an escort of a thousand horsemen, adds to the\r\nfortifications of the Tower of London and stands a siege in it. He is\r\nobliged to give himself up to Hugh de Nunant, another bishop; he escapes\r\ndisguised as a woman; he is recognised, imprisoned in a cellar, and\r\nexiled; he then excommunicates his enemies. Fortune smiles on him once\r\nmore and he is reinstated in his functions.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey Plantagenet, a natural son of Henry II., the only child who\r\nremained always faithful to the old king, had once thought he would\r\nreach the crown, but was obliged to content himself with becoming\r\narchbishop of York. As such, he scorned to ally himself either with\r\nLongchamp or with Puiset, and made war on both impartially. Longchamp\r\nforbids him to leave France; nevertheless Geoffrey lands at Dover, the\r\ncastle of which was held by Richenda, sister of the Chancellor. He\r\nmounts on horseback and gallops towards the priory of St. Martin;\r\nRichenda sends after him, and one of the lady's men was putting his hand\r\non the horse's bridle, when our lord the archbishop, shod with iron,\r\ngave a violent kick to the enemy's steed, and tore his belly open; the\r\nbeast reared, and the prelate, freeing himself, reached the priory.\r\nThere he is under watch for four days, after which he is dragged from\r\nthe very altar, and taken to the castle of Dover. At last he is\r\nliberated, and installed in York; he immediately commences to fight with\r\nhis own clergy; he enters the cathedral when vespers are half over; he\r\ninterrupts the service, and begins it over again; the indignant\r\ntreasurer has the tapers put out, and the archbishop continues his\r\npsalm-singing in the dark. He excommunicates his neighbour Hugh de\r\nPuiset, who is little concerned by it; he causes the chalices used by\r\nthe bishop of Durham to be destroyed as profaned.\r\n\r\nHugh de Puiset, who was still riding about, though attacked by the\r\ndisease that was finally to carry him off, dies full of years in 1195,\r\nafter a _reign_ of forty-three years. He had had several children by\r\ndifferent women: one of them, Henri de Puiset, joined the Crusade;\r\nanother, Hugh, remained French, and became Chancellor to King Louis\r\nVII.[230]\r\n\r\nThese warlike habits are only attenuated by degrees. In 1323 Edward II.\r\nwrites to Louis de Beaumont, bishop of Durham, reproaching a noble like\r\nhim for not defending his bishopric any better against the Scotch than\r\nif he were a mutterer of prayers like his predecessor. Command is laid\r\nupon bishop Louis to take arms and go and camp on the frontier. In the\r\nsecond half of the same century, Henry le Despencer, bishop of Norwich,\r\nhacks the peasants to pieces, during the great rising, and makes war in\r\nFlanders for the benefit of one of the two popes.\r\n\r\nSide by side with these warriors shine administrators, men of learning,\r\nsaints, all important and influential personages in their way. Such\r\nare, for example, Lanfranc, of Pavia, late abbot of St. Stephen at Caen,\r\nwho, as archbishop of Canterbury, reorganised the Church of England;\r\nAnselm of Aosta, late abbot of Bec, also an archbishop, canonised at the\r\nRenaissance, the discoverer of the famous \"ontological\" proof of the\r\nexistence of God, a paradoxical proof the inanity of which it was\r\nreserved for St. Thomas Aquinas to demonstrate; Gilbert Foliot, a\r\nFrenchman, bishop of London, celebrated for his science, a strong\r\nsupporter of Henry II.; Thomas Becket, of Norman descent, archbishop and\r\nsaint, whose quarrel with Henry II. divided England, and almost divided\r\nChristendom too; Hugh, bishop of Lincoln under the same king, of French\r\norigin, and who was also canonised; Stephen Langton, archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, who contributed as much as any of the barons to the granting\r\nof the Great Charter, and presided over the Council of London, in 1218,\r\nwhere it was solemnly confirmed[231]; Robert Grosseteste,[232] famous\r\nfor his learning and holiness, his theological treatises, his sermons,\r\nhis commentaries on Boethius and Aristotle, his taste for the divine art\r\nof music, which according to him \"drives away devils.\" Warriors or\r\nsaints, all these leaders of men keep, in their difficulties, their eyes\r\nturned towards Rome, and towards the head of the Latin Church.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nAt the same time as the monasteries, and under the shadow of their\r\nwalls, schools and libraries multiplied. The Latin education of the\r\nnation is resumed with an energy and perseverance hitherto unknown, and\r\nthis time there will be no relapse into ignorance; protected by the\r\nFrench conquest, the Latin conquest is now definitive.\r\n\r\nNot only are religious books in Latin, psalters, missals and decretals\r\ncopied and collected in monasteries, but also the ancient classics. They\r\nare liked, they are known by heart, quoted in writings, and even in\r\nconversation. An English chronicler of the twelfth century declares he\r\nwould blush to compile annals after the fashion of the Anglo-Saxons;\r\nthis barbarous manner is to be avoided; he will use Roman salt as a\r\ncondiment: \"et exarata barbarice romano sale condire.\"[233] Another, of\r\nthe same period, has the classic ideal so much before his eyes that he\r\nmakes William deliver, on the day of Hastings, a speech beginning: \"O\r\nmortalium validissimi!\"[234]\r\n\r\nA prelate who had been the tutor of the heir to the throne, and died\r\nbishop palatine of Durham, Richard de Bury,[235] collects books with a\r\npassion equal to that which will be later displayed at the court of the\r\nMedici. He has emissaries who travel all over England, France, and Italy\r\nto secure manuscripts for him; with a book one can obtain anything from\r\nhim; the abbot of St. Albans, as a propitiatory offering sends him a\r\nTerence, a Virgil, and a Quinctilian. His bedchamber is so encumbered\r\nwith books that one can hardly move in it.[236] Towards the end of his\r\nlife, never having had but one passion, he undertook to describe it,\r\nand, retired into his manor of Auckland, he wrote in Latin prose his\r\n\"Philobiblon.\"[237] In this short treatise he defends books, Greek and\r\nRoman antiquity, poetry, too, with touching emotion; he is seized with\r\nindignation when he thinks of the crimes of high treason against\r\nmanuscripts, daily committed by pupils who in spring dry flowers in\r\ntheir books; and of the ingratitude of wicked clerks, who admit into the\r\nlibrary dogs, or falcons, or worse still, a two-legged animal, \"bestia\r\nbipedalis,\" more dangerous \"than the basilisk, or aspic,\" who,\r\ndiscovering the volumes \"insufficiently concealed by the protecting web\r\nof a dead spider,\" condemns them to be sold, and converted for her own\r\nuse into silken hoods and furred gowns.[238] Eve's descendants continue,\r\nthinks the bishop, to wrongfully meddle with the tree of knowledge.\r\n\r\nWhat painful commiseration did he not experience on penetrating into an\r\nill-kept convent library! \"Then we ordered the book-presses, chests, and\r\nbags of the noble monasteries to be opened; and, astonished at beholding\r\nagain the light of day, the volumes came out of their sepulchres and\r\ntheir prolonged sleep.... Some of them, which had ranked among the\r\ndaintiest, lay for ever spoilt, in all the horror of decay, covered by\r\nfilth left by the rats; they who had once been robed in purple and fine\r\nlinen now lay on ashes, covered with a cilice.\"[239] The worthy bishop\r\nlooks upon letters with a religious veneration, worthy of the ancients\r\nthemselves; his enthusiasm recalls that of Cicero; no one at the\r\nRenaissance, not even the illustrious Bessarion, has praised old\r\nmanuscripts with a more touching fervour, or more nearly attained to the\r\neloquence of the great Latin orator when he speaks of books in his \"Pro\r\nArchia\": \"Thanks to books,\" says the prelate, \"the dead appear to me as\r\nthough they still lived.... Everything decays and falls into dust, by\r\nthe force of Time; Saturn is never weary of devouring his children, and\r\nthe glory of the world would be buried in oblivion, had not God as a\r\nremedy conferred on mortal man the benefit of books.... Books are the\r\nmasters that instruct us without rods or ferulas, without reprimands or\r\nanger, without the solemnity of the gown or the expense of lessons. Go\r\nto them, you will not find them asleep; question them, they will not\r\nrefuse to answer; if you err, no scoldings on their part; if you are\r\nignorant, no mocking laughter.\"[240]\r\n\r\nThese teachings and these examples bore fruit; in renovated England,\r\nLatin-speaking clerks swarmed. It is often difficult while reading their\r\nworks to discover whether they are of native or of foreign extraction;\r\nhates with them are less strong than with the rest of their\r\ncompatriots; most of them have studied not only in England but in\r\nParis; science has made of them cosmopolitans; they belong, above all,\r\nto the Latin country, and the Latin country has not suffered.\r\n\r\nThe Latin country had two capitals, a religious capital which was Rome,\r\nand a literary capital which was Paris. \"In the same manner as the city\r\nof Athens shone in former days as the mother of liberal arts and the\r\nnurse of philosophers, ... so in our times Paris has raised the standard\r\nof learning and civilisation, not only in France but in all the rest of\r\nEurope, and, as the mother of wisdom, she welcomes guests from all parts\r\nof the world, supplies all their wants, and submits them all to her\r\npacific rule.\"[241] So said Bartholomew the Englishman in the thirteenth\r\ncentury. \"What a flood of joy swept over my heart,\" wrote in the\r\nfollowing century another Englishman, that same Richard de Bury, \"every\r\ntime I was able to visit that paradise of the world, Paris! My stay\r\nthere always seemed brief to me, so great was my passion. There were\r\nlibraries of perfume more delicious than caskets of spices, orchards of\r\nscience ever green....\"[242] The University of Paris held without\r\ncontest the first rank during the Middle Ages; it counted among its\r\nstudents, kings, saints, popes, statesmen, poets, learned men of all\r\nsorts come from all countries, Italians like Dante, Englishmen like\r\nStephen Langton.\r\n\r\nIts lustre dates from the twelfth century. At that time a fusion\r\ntook place between the theological school of Notre-Dame, where shone,\r\ntowards the beginning of the century, Guillaume de Champeaux, and the\r\nschools of logic that Abelard's teaching gave birth to on St.\r\nGenevieve's Mount. This state of things was not created, but\r\nconsecrated by Pope Innocent III., a former student at Paris, who\r\nby his bulls of 1208 and 1209 formed the masters and students into\r\none association, _universitas_.[243]\r\n\r\nAccording to a mediaeval custom, which has been perpetuated in the East,\r\nand is still found for instance at the great University of El Azhar at\r\nCairo, the students were divided into nations: France, Normandy,\r\nPicardy, England. It was a division by races, and not by countries; the\r\nidea of mother countries politically divided being excluded, in theory\r\nat least, from the Latin realm. Thus the Italians were included in the\r\nFrench nation, and the Germans in the English one. Of all these\r\nforeigners the English were the most numerous; they had in Paris six\r\ncolleges for theology alone.\r\n\r\nThe faculties were four in number: theology, law, medicine, arts. The\r\nlatter, though least in rank, was the most important from the number of\r\nits pupils, and was a preparation for the others. The student of arts\r\nwas about fifteen years of age; he passed a first degree called\r\n\"determinance\" or bachelorship; then a second one, the licence, after\r\nwhich, in a solemn ceremony termed _inceptio_, the corporation of\r\nmasters invested him with the cap, the badge of mastership. He had then,\r\naccording to his pledge, to dispute for forty successive days with every\r\ncomer; then, still very youthful, and frequently beardless, he himself\r\nbegan to teach. A master who taught was called a Regent, _Magister\r\nregens_.\r\n\r\nThe principal schools were situated in the \"rue du Fouarre\" (straw,\r\nlitter), \"vico degli Strami,\" says Dante, a street that still exists\r\nunder the same name, but the ancient houses of which are gradually\r\ndisappearing. In this formerly dark and narrow street, surrounded by\r\nlanes with names carrying us far back into the past (\"rue de la\r\nParcheminerie,\" &c), the most illustrious masters taught, and the most\r\nsingular disorders arose. The students come from the four corners of\r\nEurope without a farthing, having, in consequence, nothing to lose, and\r\nto whom ample privileges had been granted, did not shine by their\r\ndiscipline. Neither was the population of the quarter an exemplary\r\none.[244] We gather from the royal ordinances that the rue du Fouarre,\r\n\"vicus ultra parvum pontem, vocatus gallice la rue du Feurre,\" had to be\r\nclosed at night by barriers and chains, because of individuals who had\r\nthe wicked habit of establishing themselves at night, with their\r\n_ribaudes_, \"mulieres immundae!\" in the lecture-rooms, and leaving, on\r\ntheir departure, by way of a joke, the professor's chair covered with\r\n\"horrible\" filth. Far from feeling any awe, these evil-doers found, on\r\nthe contrary, a special amusement in the idea of perpetrating their\r\njokes in the _sanctum_ of philosophers, who, says the ordinance of the\r\nwise king Charles V., \"should be clean and honest, and inhabit clean,\r\ndecent, and honest places.\"[245]\r\n\r\nTeaching, the principal object of which was logic, consisted in the\r\nreading and interpreting of such books as were considered authorities.\r\n\"The method in expounding is always the same. The commentator discusses\r\nin a prologue some general questions relating to the work he is about\r\nto lecture upon, and he usually treats of its material, formal, final,\r\nand efficient causes. He points out the principal divisions, takes the\r\nfirst member of the division, subdivides it, divides the first member of\r\nthis subdivision, and thus by a series of divisions, each being\r\nsuccessively cleft into two, he reaches a division which only comprises\r\nthe first chapter. He applies to each part of the work the same process\r\nas to its whole. He continues these divisions until he comes to having\r\nbefore him only one phrase including one single complete idea.\"\r\n\r\nAnother not less important part of the instruction given consisted in\r\noratorical jousts; the masters disputed among themselves, and the pupils\r\ndid likewise. In a time when paper was scarce and parchment precious,\r\ndisputes replaced our written exercises. The weapons employed in these\r\njousts were blunt ones; but as in real tournaments where \"armes\r\ncourtoises\" were used, disputants were sometimes carried away by\r\npassion, and the result was a true battle: \"They scream themselves\r\nhoarse, they lavish unmannerly expressions, abuse, threats, upon each\r\nother. They even take to cuffing, kicking, and biting.\"[246]\r\n\r\nUnder this training, rudimentary though it was, superior minds became\r\nsharpened, they got accustomed to think, to weigh the pros and cons, to\r\ninvestigate freely; a taste for intellectual things was kept up in them.\r\nThe greatest geniuses who had come to study Aristotle on St. Genevieve's\r\nMount were always proud to call themselves pupils of Paris. But narrow\r\nminds grew there more narrow; they remained, as Rabelais will say later,\r\nfoolish and silly, dreaming, stultified things, \"tout niais, tout reveux\r\net rassotes.\" John of Salisbury, a brilliant scholar of Paris in the\r\ntwelfth century, had the curiosity to come, after a long absence, and\r\nsee his old companions \"that dialectics still detained on St.\r\nGenevieve's Mount.\" \"I found them,\" he tells us, \"just as I had left\r\nthem, and at the same point; they had not advanced one step in the art\r\nof solving our ancient questions, nor added to their science the\r\nsmallest proposition.... I then clearly saw, what it is easy to\r\ndiscover, that the study of dialectics, fruitful if employed as a means\r\nto reach the sciences, remain inert and barren if taken as being itself\r\nthe object of study.\"[247]\r\n\r\nDuring this time were developing, on the borders of the Isis and the\r\nCam, the Universities, so famous since, of Oxford and Cambridge; but\r\ntheir celebrity was chiefly local, and they never reached the\r\ninternational reputation of the one at Paris. Both towns had flourishing\r\nschools in the twelfth century; in the thirteenth, these schools were\r\nconstituted into a University, on the model of Paris; they were granted\r\nprivileges, and the Pope, who would not let slip this opportunity of\r\nintervening, confirmed them.[248]\r\n\r\nThe rules of discipline, the teaching, and the degrees are the same as\r\nat Paris. The turbulence is just as great; there are incessant battles;\r\nbattles between the students of the North and those of the South,\r\n\"boreales et australes,\" between the English and Irish, between the\r\nclerks and the laity. In 1214 some clerks are hung by the citizens of\r\nthe town; the Pope's legate instantly makes the power of Rome felt, and\r\navenges the insult sustained by privileged persons belonging to the\r\nLatin country. During ten years the inhabitants of Oxford shall remit\r\nthe students half their rent; they shall pay down fifty-two shillings\r\neach year on St. Nicholas' day, in favour of indigent students; and\r\nthey shall give a banquet to a hundred poor students. Even the bill of\r\nfare is settled by the Roman authority: bread, ale, soup, a dish of fish\r\nor of meat; and this for ever. The perpetrators of the hanging shall\r\ncome barefooted, without girdle, cloak or hat, to remove their victims\r\nfrom their temporary resting-place, and, followed by all the citizens,\r\nbury them with their own hands in the place assigned to them in\r\nconsecrated ground.\r\n\r\nIn 1252 the Irish and \"Northerners\" begin to fight in St. Mary's Church.\r\nThey are obliged by authority to appoint twelve delegates, who negotiate\r\na treaty of peace. In 1313 a prohibition is proclaimed against bearing\r\nnames of nations, these distinctions being a constant source of\r\nquarrels. In 1334 such numbers of \"Surrois\" and \"Norrois\" clerks are\r\nimprisoned in Oxford Castle after a battle, that the sheriff declares\r\nescapes are sure to occur.[249] In 1354 a student, seated in a tavern,\r\n\"in taberna vini,\" pours a jug of wine over the tavern-keeper's head,\r\nand breaks the jug upon it. Unfortunately the head is broken as well;\r\nthe \"laity\" take the part of the victim, pursue the clerks, kill twenty\r\nof them, and fling their bodies \"in latrinas\"; they even betake\r\nthemselves to the books of the students, and \"slice them with knives and\r\nhatchets.\" During that term \"oh! woe! no degrees in Logic were taken at\r\nthe University of Oxford.\"[250] In 1364 war breaks out again between the\r\ncitizens and students, \"commissum fuit bellum,\" and lasts four days.\r\n\r\nRegulations, frequently renewed, show the nature of the principal\r\nabuses. These laws pronounce: excommunication against the belligerents;\r\nexclusion from the University against those students who harboured\r\n\"little women\" (_mulierculas_) in their lodgings, major excommunication\r\nand imprisonment against those who amuse themselves by celebrating\r\nbacchanals in churches, masked, disguised, and crowned \"with leaves or\r\nflowers\"; all this about 1250. The statutes of University Hall, 1292,\r\nprohibit the fellows from fighting, from holding immodest conversations\r\ntogether, from telling each other love tales, \"fubulas de amasiis,\" and\r\nfrom singing improper songs.[251]\r\n\r\nThe lectures bore on Aristotle, Boethius, Priscian, and Donatus; Latin\r\nand French were studied; the fellows were bound to converse together in\r\nLatin; a regulation also prescribed that the scholars should be taught\r\nLatin prosody, and accustomed to write epistles \"in decent language,\r\nwithout emphasis or hyperbole, ... and as much as possible full of\r\nsense.\"[252] Objectionable passages are to be avoided; Ovid's \"Art of\r\nLove\" and the book of love by Pamphilus are prohibited.\r\n\r\nFrom the thirteenth century foundations increase in number, both at\r\nOxford and Cambridge. Now \"chests\" are created, a kind of pawnbroking\r\ninstitution for the benefit of scholars; now a college is created like\r\nUniversity College, the most ancient of all, founded by William of\r\nDurham, who died in 1249, or New College, established by the illustrious\r\nChancellor of Edward III. William of Wykeham. Sometimes books are\r\nbequeathed, as by Richard de Bury and Thomas de Cobham in the fourteenth\r\ncentury, or by Humphrey of Gloucester, in the fifteenth.[253] The\r\njourney to Paris continues a title to respect, but it is no longer\r\nindispensable.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nWith these resources at hand, and encouraged by the example of rulers\r\nsuch as Henry \"Beauclerc\" and Henry II., the subjects of the kings of\r\nEngland latinised themselves in great numbers, and produced some of the\r\nLatin writings which enjoyed the widest reputation throughout civilised\r\nEurope. They handle the language with such facility in the twelfth\r\ncentury, one might believe it to be their mother-tongue; the chief\r\nmonuments of English thought at this time are Latin writings. Latin\r\ntales, chronicles, satires, sermons, scientific and medical works,\r\ntreatises on style, prose romances, and epics in verse, all kinds of\r\ncomposition are produced by Englishmen in considerable numbers.\r\n\r\nOne of them writes a poem in hexameters on the Trojan war, which\r\ndoubtless bears traces of barbarism, but more resembles antique models\r\nthan any other imitation made in Europe at the time. It was attributed\r\nto Cornelius Nepos, so late even as the Renaissance, though the author,\r\nJoseph of Exeter,[254] who composed it between 1178 and 1183, had\r\ndedicated his work to Baldwin, archbishop of Canterbury, and mentioned\r\nin it Arthur, \"flos regum Arthurus,\" whose return was still expected by\r\nthe Britons, \"Britonum ridenda fides.\" Joseph is acquainted with the\r\nclassics; he has read Virgil, and follows to the best of his ability the\r\nprecepts of Horace.[255] Differing in this from Benoit de Sainte-More\r\nand his contemporaries, he depicts heroes that are not knights, and who\r\nat their death are not buried in Gothic churches by monks chanting\r\npsalms. This may be accounted a small merit; at that time, however, it\r\nwas anything but a common one, and, in truth, Joseph of Exeter alone\r\npossessed it.\r\n\r\nIn Latin poems of a more modern inspiration, much ingenuity,\r\nobservation, sometimes wit, but occasionally only commonplace wisdom,\r\nwere expended by Godfrey of Winchester, who composed epigrams about the\r\ncommencement of the twelfth century; by Henry of Huntingdon, the\r\nhistorian who wrote some also; by Alexander Neckham, author of a prose\r\ntreatise on the \"Natures of Things\"; Alain de l'Isle and John de\r\nHauteville, who both, long before Jean de Meun, made Nature discourse,\r\n\"de omni re scibili\"[256]; Walter the Englishman, and Odo of Cheriton,\r\nauthors in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries of Latin fables,[257]\r\nand last, and above all, by Nigel Wireker, who wrote in picturesque\r\nstyle and flowing verse the story of Burnellus, the ass whose tail was\r\ntoo short.[258]\r\n\r\nBurnellus, type of the ambitious monk, escapes from his stable, and\r\nwishes to rise in the world. He consults Galen, who laughs at him, and\r\nsends him to Salerno.[259] At Salerno he is again made a fool of, and\r\nprovided with elixirs, warranted to make his tail grow to a beautiful\r\nlength. But in passing through Lyons on his return, he quarrels with the\r\ndogs of a wicked monk called Fromond; while kicking right and left he\r\nkicks off his vials, which break, while Grimbald, the dog, cuts off half\r\nhis tail. A sad occurrence! He revenges himself on Fromond, however, by\r\ndrowning him in the Rhone, and, lifting up his voice, he makes then the\r\nvalley ring with a \"canticle\" celebrating his triumph.[260]\r\n\r\nWhat can he do next? It is useless for him to think of attaining\r\nperfection of form; he will shine by his science; he will go to the\r\nUniversity of Paris, that centre of all light; he will become\r\n\"Magister,\" and be appointed bishop. The people will bow down to him as\r\nhe passes; it is a dream of bliss, La Fontaine's story of the \"Pot au\r\nLait.\"\r\n\r\nHe reaches Paris, and naturally matriculates among the English nation.\r\nHe falls to studying; at the end of a year he has been taught many\r\nthings, but is only able to say \"ya\" (semper ya repetit). He continues\r\nto work, scourges himself, follows the lectures for many years, but\r\nstill knows nothing but \"ya,\" and remains an ass.[261] What then? He\r\nwill found an abbey, the rule of which shall combine the delights of all\r\nthe others: it will be possible to gossip there as at Grandmont, to\r\nleave fasting alone as at Cluny, to dress warmly as among the\r\nPremonstrant, and to have a female friend like the secular canons; it\r\nwill be a Theleme even before Rabelais.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly an unexpected personage appears on the scene, the donkey's\r\nmaster, Bernard the peasant, who had long been on the look-out for him,\r\nand by means of a stick the magister, bishop, mitred abbot, is led back\r\nto his stall.\r\n\r\nNot satisfied with the writing of Latin poems, the subjects of the\r\nEnglish kings would construct theories and establish the rules of the\r\nart. It was carrying boldness very far; they did not realise that\r\ntheories can only be laid down with safety in periods of maturity, and\r\nthat in formulating them too early there is risk of propagating nothing\r\nbut the rules of bad taste. This was the case with Geoffrey de Vinesauf,\r\nat the beginning of the thirteenth century. Geoffrey is sure of himself;\r\nhe learnedly joins example to precept, he juggles with words; he soars\r\non high, far above men of good sense. It was with great reason his work\r\nwas called the New art of poetry, \"Nova Poetria,\"[262] for it has\r\nnothing in common with the old one, with Horace's. It is dedicated to\r\nthe Pope, and begins by puns on the name of Innocent[263]; it closes\r\nwith a comparison between the Pope and God: \"Thou art neither God nor\r\nman, but an intermediary being whom God has taken into partnership....\r\nNot wishing to keep all for himself, he has taken heaven and given thee\r\nearth; what could he do better?\"[264]\r\n\r\nPrecepts and examples are in the same style. Geoffrey teaches how to\r\npraise, blame, and ridicule; he gives models of good prosopopoeias;\r\nprosopopoeias for times of happiness: an apostrophe to England\r\ngoverned by Richard Coeur-de-Lion (we know how well he governed);\r\nprosopopoeia for times of sorrow: an apostrophe to England, whose\r\nsovereign (this same Richard) has been killed on a certain Friday:\r\n\r\n\"England, of his death thou thyself diest!... O lamentable day of Venus!\r\nO cruel planet! this day has been thy night, this Venus thy venom; by\r\nher wert thou vulnerable!... O woe and more than woe! O death! O\r\ntruculent death! O death, I wish thou wert dead! It pleased thee to\r\nremove the sun and to obscure the soil with obscurity!\"[265]\r\n\r\nThen follow counsels as to the manner of treating ridiculous\r\npeople[266]: they come in good time, and we breathe again, but we could\r\nhave wished them even more stringent and sweeping. Such exaggerations\r\nmake us understand the wisdom of the Oxford regulations prescribing\r\nsimplicity and prohibiting emphasis; the more so if we consider that\r\nGeoffrey did not innovate, but merely turned into rules the tastes of\r\nmany. Before him men of comparatively sound judgment, like Joseph of\r\nExeter, forgot themselves so far as to apostrophise in these terms the\r\nnight in which Troy was taken: \"O night, cruel night! night truly\r\nnoxious! troublous, sorrowful, traitorous, sanguinary night!\"[267] &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nThe series of Latin prose authors of that epoch, grave or facetious,\r\nphilosophers, moralists, satirists, historians, men of science, romance\r\nand tale writers, is still more remarkable in England than that of the\r\npoets. Had they only suspected the importance of the native language\r\nand left Latin, several of them would have held a very high rank in the\r\nnational literature.\r\n\r\nRomance is represented by Geoffrey of Monmouth, who in the twelfth\r\ncentury wrote his famous \"Historia Regum Britanniae,\" the influence of\r\nwhich in England and on the Continent has already been seen. Prose tales\r\nwere written in astonishing quantities, in the twelfth and thirteenth\r\ncenturies, by those pious authors who, under pretext of edifying and\r\namusing their readers at the same time, began by amusing, and frequently\r\nforgot to edify. They put into their collections all they knew in the\r\nway of legends, jokes, and facetious stories. England produced several\r\nsuch collections; their authors usually add a moral to their tales, but\r\nsometimes omit it, or else they simply say: \"Moralise as thou wilt!\"\r\n\r\nIn these innumerable well-told tales, full of sprightly dialogue, can be\r\nalready detected something of the art of the _conteur_ which will appear\r\nin Chaucer, and something almost of the art of the novelist, destined\r\nfive hundred years later to reach such a high development in England.\r\nThe curiosity of the Celt, reawakened by the Norman, is perpetuated in\r\nGreat Britain; stories are doted on there. \"It is the custom,\" says an\r\nEnglish author of the thirteenth century, \"in rich families, to spend\r\nthe winter evenings around the fire, telling tales of former\r\ntimes....\"[268]\r\n\r\nSubjects for tales were not lacking. The last researches have about made\r\nit certain that the immense \"Gesta Romanorum,\" so popular in the Middle\r\nAges, were compiled in England about the end of the thirteenth\r\ncentury.[269] The collection of the English Dominican John of Bromyard,\r\ncomposed in the following century, is still more voluminous. Some idea\r\ncan be formed of it from the fact that the printed copy preserved at the\r\nNational Library of Paris weighs fifteen pounds.[270]\r\n\r\nEverything is found in these collections, from mere jokes and happy\r\nretorts to real novels. There are coarse fabliaux in their embryonic\r\nstage, objectionable tales where the frail wife derides the injured\r\nhusband, graceful stories, miracles of the Virgin. We recognise in\r\npassing some fable that La Fontaine has since made famous, episodes out\r\nof the \"Roman de Renart,\" anecdotes drawn from Roman history, adventures\r\nthat, transformed and remodelled, have at length found their definitive\r\nrendering in Shakespeare's plays.\r\n\r\nAll is grist that comes to the mill of these authors; their stories are\r\nof French, Latin, English, Hindu origin. It is plain, however, that they\r\nwrite for Englishmen from the fact that many of their stories are\r\nlocalised in England, and that quotations in English are here and there\r\ninserted into the tale.[271]\r\n\r\nIn turning the pages of these voluminous works, glimpses will be caught\r\nof the Wolf, the Fox, and Tybert the cat; the Miller, his son and the\r\nAss; the Women and the Secret (instead of eggs, it is here a question of\r\n\"exceedingly black crows\"); the Rats who wish to hang a bell about the\r\nCat's neck. Many tales, fabliaux, and short stories will be recognised\r\nthat have become popular under their French, English, or Italian shape,\r\nsuch as the lay of the \"Oiselet,\"[272] the \"Chienne qui pleure,\" or the\r\nWeeping Bitch, the lay of Aristotle, the Geese of Friar Philip, the Pear\r\nTree, the Hermit who got drunk. Some of them are very indecent, but they\r\nwere not left out of the collections on that account, any more than\r\nminiaturists were forbidden to paint on the margins of holy, or almost\r\nholy books, scenes that were far from being so. A manuscript of the\r\ndecretals, for example, painted in England at the beginning of the\r\nfourteenth century, exhibits a series of drawings illustrating some of\r\nthese stories, and meant to fit an obviously unexpurgated text.[273]\r\n\r\nThe Virgin plays her usual part of an indulgent protectress; the\r\nstory-tellers strangely deviate from the sacred type set before them in\r\nthe Scriptures. They represent her as the Merciful One whose patience no\r\ncrime can exhaust, and whose goodwill is enlisted by the slightest act\r\nof homage. She is transformed and becomes in their hands an\r\nintermediate being between a saint, a goddess, and a fairy. The\r\nsacristan-nun of a convent, beautiful as may be believed, falls in love\r\nwith a clerk, doubtless a charming one, and, unable to live without him,\r\n\"throws her keys on the altar, and roves with her friend for five years\r\noutside the monastery.\" Passing by the place at the end of that time,\r\nshe is impelled by curiosity to go to the convent and inquire concerning\r\nherself, the sacristan-nun of former years. To her great surprise she\r\nhears that the sister continues there, and edifies the whole community\r\nby her piety. At night, while she sleeps, the Virgin appears to her in a\r\nvision, saying: \"Return, unfortunate one, to thy convent! It is I who,\r\nassuming thy shape, have fulfilled thy duties until now.\"[274] A\r\nconversion of course follows. A professional thief, who robbed and did\r\nnothing besides, \"always invoked the Virgin with great devotion, even\r\nwhen he set out to steal.\"[275] He is caught and hanged; but the Virgin\r\nherself holds him up, and keeps him alive; he is taken down, and turns\r\nmonk.\r\n\r\nAnother tale, of a romantic turn, is at once charming, absurd, immoral,\r\nedifying, and touching: \"Celestinus reigned in the City of Rome. He was\r\nexceedingly prudent, and had a pretty daughter.\"[276] A knight fell in\r\nlove with her, but, being also very prudent after a fashion, he argued\r\nthus: \"Never will the emperor consent to give me his daughter to wife, I\r\nam not worthy; but if I could in some manner obtain the love of the\r\nmaiden, I should ask for no more.\" He went often to see the princess,\r\nand tried to find favour in her eyes, but she said to him: \"Thy trouble\r\nis thrown away; thinkest thou I know not what all these fine speeches\r\nmean?\"\r\n\r\nHe then offers money: \"It will be a hundred marks,\" says the emperor's\r\ndaughter. But when evening comes the knight falls into such a deep sleep\r\nthat he only awakes on the following morning. The knight ruins himself\r\nin order to obtain the same favour a second time, and succeeds no better\r\nthan at first. He has spent all he had, and, more in love than ever, he\r\njourneys afar to seek a lender. He arrives \"in a town where were many\r\nmerchants, and a variety of philosophers, among them master Virgil.\" A\r\nmerchant, a man of singular humour, agrees to lend the money; he refuses\r\nto take the lands of the young man as a security; \"but thou shalt sign\r\nwith thy blood the bond, and if thou dost not return the entire sum on\r\nthe appointed day, I shall have the right to remove with a\r\nwell-sharpened knife all the flesh off thy body.\"\r\n\r\nThe knight signs in haste, for he is possessed by his passion, and he\r\ngoes to consult Virgil. \"My good master,\" he says, using the same\r\nexpression as Dante, \"I need your advice;\" and Virgil then reveals to\r\nhim the existence of a talisman, sole cause of his irresistible desire\r\nto sleep. The knight returns with speed to the strange palace inhabited\r\nby the still stranger daughter of this so \"prudent\" emperor; he removes\r\nthe talisman, and is no longer overpowered by sleep.\r\n\r\nTo many tears succeeds a mutual affection, so true, so strong,\r\naccompanied by so much happiness, that both forget the fatal date.\r\nHowever, start he must. \"Go,\" says the maiden, \"and offer him double, or\r\ntreble the sum; offer him all the gold he wishes; I will procure it for\r\nthee.\" He arrives, he offers, but the merchant refuses: \"Thou speakest\r\nin vain! Wert thou to offer me all the wealth of the city, nothing would\r\nI accept but what has been signed, sealed, and settled between us.\"\r\nThey go before the judge; the sentence is not a doubtful one.\r\n\r\nThe maiden, however, kept herself well informed of all that went on,\r\nand, seeing the turn affairs were taking, \"she cut her hair, donned a\r\nrich suit of men's clothes, mounted a palfrey, and set out for the\r\npalace where her lover was about to hear his sentence.\" She asks to be\r\nallowed to defend the knight. \"But nothing can be done,\" says the judge.\r\nShe offers money to the merchant, which he refuses; she then exclaims:\r\n\"Let it be done as he desires; let him have the flesh, and nothing but\r\nthe flesh; the bond says nothing of the blood.\" Hearing this, the\r\nmerchant replies: \"Give me my money and I hold you clear of the rest.\"\r\n\"Not so,\" said the maiden. The merchant is confounded, the knight\r\nreleased; the maiden returns home hurriedly, puts on her female attire,\r\nand hastens out to meet her lover, eager to hear all that has passed.\r\n\r\n\"O my dear mistress, that I love above all things, I nearly lost my life\r\nthis day; but as I was about to be condemned, suddenly appeared a knight\r\nof an admirable presence, so handsome that I never saw his like.\" How\r\ncould she, at these words, prevent her sparkling eyes from betraying\r\nher? \"He saved me by his wisdom, and nought had I even to pay.\r\n\r\n\"_The Maiden._--Thou might'st have been more generous, and brought home\r\nto supper the knight who had saved thy life.\r\n\r\n\"_The Knight._--He appeared and disappeared so suddenly I could not.\r\n\r\n\"_The Maiden._--Would'st thou recognise him again if he returned?\r\n\r\n\"_The Knight._--I should, assuredly.\"[277]\r\n\r\nShe then puts on again her male attire, and it is easy to imagine with\r\nwhat transports the knight beheld his saviour in his friend. The end of\r\nthis first outline of a \"Merchant of Venice\" is not less naive,\r\npicturesque, and desultory than the rest: \"Thereupon he immediately\r\nmarried the maiden,\" and they led saintly lives. We are not told what\r\nthe prudent emperor Celestinus thought of this \"immediately.\"\r\n\r\nNext to these compilers whose works became celebrated, but whose names\r\nfor the most part remained concealed, were professional authors, who\r\nwere and wanted to be known, and who enjoyed a great personal fame.\r\nForemost among them were John of Salisbury and Walter Map.\r\n\r\nJohn of Salisbury,[278] a former pupil of Abelard, a friend of St.\r\nBernard, Thomas Becket, and the English Pope Adrian IV., the envoy of\r\nHenry II. to the court of Rome, which he visited ten times in twelve\r\nyears, writes in Latin his \"Policratic,\"[279] or \"De nugis Curialium,\"\r\nhis \"Metalogic,\" his \"Enthetic\" (in verse), and his eulogy on\r\nBecket.[280] John is only too well versed in the classics, and he\r\nquotes them to an extent that does more credit to his erudition than to\r\nhis taste; but he has the gift of observation, and his remarks on the\r\nfollies of his time have a great historical value. In his \"Policratic\"\r\nis found a satire on a sort of personage who was then beginning to play\r\nhis part again, after an interruption of several centuries, namely, the\r\n_curialis_, or courtier; a criticism on histrions who, with their\r\nindecent farces, made a rough prelude to modern dramatic art; a\r\ncaricature of those fashionable singers who disgraced the religious\r\nceremonies in the newly erected cathedrals by their songs resembling\r\nthose \"of women ... of sirens ... of nightingales and parrots.\"[281] He\r\nridicules hunting-monks, and also those chiromancers for whom Becket\r\nhimself had a weakness. \"Above all,\" says John, by way of conclusion and\r\napology, \"let not the men of the Court upbraid me with the follies I\r\ntrust them with; let them know I did not mean them in the least, I\r\nsatirised only myself and those like me, and it would be hard indeed if\r\nI were forbidden to castigate both myself and my peers.\"[282] In his\r\n\"Metalogic,\" he scoffs at the vain dialectics of silly logicians,\r\nCornificians, as he calls them, an appellation that stuck to them all\r\nthrough the Middle Ages, and at their long phrases interlarded with so\r\nmany negative particles that, in order to find out whether yes or no was\r\nmeant, it became necessary to examine if the number of noes was an odd\r\nor even one.\r\n\r\nBold ideas abound with John of Salisbury; he praises Brutus; he is of\r\nopinion that the murder of tyrants is not only justifiable, but an\r\nhonest and commendable deed: \"Non modo licitum est, sed aequum et\r\njustum.\" Whatever may be the apparent prosperity of the great, the State\r\nwill go to ruin if the common people suffer: \"When the people suffer, it\r\nis as though the sovereign had the gout\"[283]; he must not imagine he is\r\nin health; let him try to walk, and down he falls.\r\n\r\nCharacteristics of the same sort are found, with much more sparkling\r\nwit, in the Latin works of Walter Map.[284] This Welshman has the\r\nvivacity of the Celts his compatriots; he was celebrated at the court of\r\nHenry II., and throughout England for his repartees and witticisms, so\r\ncelebrated indeed that he himself came to agree to others' opinion, and\r\nthought them worth collecting. He thus formed a very bizarre book,\r\nwithout beginning or end, in which he noted, day by day,[285] all the\r\ncurious things he had heard--\"ego verbum audivi\"--and with greater\r\nabundance those he had said, including a great many puns. Thus it\r\nhappens that certain chapters of his \"De Nugis Curialium,\" a title that\r\nthe work owes to the success of John of Salisbury's, are real novels,\r\nand have the smartness of such; others are real fabliaux, with all their\r\ncoarseness; others are scenes of comedy, with dialogues, and indications\r\nof characters as in a play[286]; others again are anecdotes of the East,\r\n\"quoddam mirabile,\" told on their return by pilgrims or crusaders.\r\n\r\nLike John of Salisbury, Map had studied in Paris, fulfilled missions to\r\nRome, and known Becket; but he shared neither his sympathy for France,\r\nnor his affection for St. Bernard. In the quarrel which sprung up\r\nbetween the saint and Abelard, he took the part of the latter. Though he\r\nbelonged to the Church, he is never weary of sneering at the monks, and\r\nespecially at the Cistercians; he imputes to St. Bernard abortive\r\nmiracles. \"Placed,\" says Map, \"in the presence of a corpse, Bernard\r\nexclaimed: 'Walter, come forth!'--But Walter, as he did not hear the\r\nvoice of Jesus, so did he not listen with the ears of Lazarus, and came\r\nnot.\"[287] Women also are for Map the subject of constant satires; he\r\nwas the author of that famous \"Dissuasio Valerii ad Rufinum de ducenda\r\nuxore,\"[288] well known to the Wife of Bath and which the Middle Ages\r\npersistently attributed to St. Jerome. Map had asserted his authorship\r\nand stated that he had written the dissertation \"changing only our\r\nnames,\" assuming for himself the name of Valerius \"me qui Walterus sum,\"\r\nand calling his uxorious friend Rufinus because he was red-haired. But\r\nit was of no avail, and St. Jerome continued to be the author, in the\r\nsame way as Cornelius Nepos was credited with having written Joseph of\r\nExeter's \"Trojan War,\" dedicated though it was to the archbishop of\r\nCanterbury. Map is very strong in his advice to his red-haired friend,\r\nwho \"was bent upon being married, not loved, and aspired to the fate of\r\nVulcan, not of Mars.\"\r\n\r\nAs a compensation many poems in Latin and French were attributed to Map,\r\nof doubtful authenticity. That he wrote verses and was famous as a poet\r\nthere is no question, but what poems were his we do not know for\r\ncertain. To him was ascribed most of the \"Goliardic\" poetry current in\r\nthe Middle Ages, so called on account of the principal personage who\r\nfigures in it, Golias, the type of the gluttonous and debauched prelate.\r\nSome of those poems were merry songs full of humour and _entrain_,\r\nperfectly consistent with what we know of Map's fantasy: \"My supreme\r\nwish is to die in the tavern! May my dying lips be wet with wine! So\r\nthat on their coming the choirs of angels will exclaim: 'God be merciful\r\nto this drinker!'\"[289] Doubts exist also as to what his French poems\r\nwere; most of his jokes and repartees were delivered in French, as we\r\nknow from the testimony of Gerald de Barry,[290] but what he wrote in\r\nthat language is uncertain. The \"Lancelot\" is assigned to him in many\r\nmanuscripts and is perhaps his work.[291]\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of the Angevin kings also took part in the scientific\r\nmovement. In the ranks of their literary men using the Latin language\r\nare jurists, physicians, savants, historians, theologians, and, among\r\nthe latter, some of the most famous doctors of the Middle Ages:\r\nAlexander of Hales, the \"irrefragable doctor\"[292]; Duns Scot, the\r\n\"subtle doctor\"; Adam de Marisco, friend and adviser of Simon de\r\nMontfort, the \"illustrious doctor\"; Ockham, the \"invincible doctor\";\r\nRoger Bacon, the \"admirable doctor\"; Bradwardine, the \"profound doctor,\"\r\nand yet others.\r\n\r\nScot discusses the greatest problems of soul and matter, and amid many\r\ncontradictions, and much obscurity, arrives at this conclusion, that\r\nmatter is one: \"Socrates and the brazen sphere are identical in nature.\"\r\nHe almost reaches this further conclusion, that \"being is one.\"[293] His\r\nreputation is immense during the Middle Ages; it diminishes at the\r\nRenaissance, and Rabelais, drawing up a list of some remarkable books in\r\nSt. Victor's library, inscribes on it, between the \"Maschefaim des\r\nAdvocats\" and the \"Ratepenade des Cardinaux,\" the works of the subtle\r\ndoctor under the irreverent title of \"Barbouillamenta Scoti.\"[294]\r\n\r\nOckham, in the pay of Philippe-le-Bel--for England, that formerly had to\r\nsend for Lanfranc and Anselm, can now furnish the Continent with\r\ndoctors--makes war on Boniface VIII., and, drawing his arguments from\r\nboth St. Paul and Aristotle, attacks the temporal power of the\r\npopes.[295] Roger Bacon endeavours to clear up the chaos of the\r\nsciences; he forestalls his illustrious namesake, and classifies the\r\ncauses of human errors.[296] Archbishop Bradwardine,[297] who died in\r\nthe great plague of 1349, restricts himself to theology, and in a book\r\nfamous during the Middle Ages, defends the \"Cause of God\" against all\r\nsceptics, heretics, infidels, and miscreants, confuting them all, and\r\neven Aristotle himself.[298]\r\n\r\nNo longer is Salerno alone to produce illustrious physicians, or Bologne\r\nillustrious jurists. A \"Rosa Anglica,\" the work of John of Gaddesden,\r\ncourt physician under Edward II., has the greatest success in learned\r\nEurope, and teaches how the stone can be cured by rubbing the invalid\r\nwith a paste composed of crickets and beetles pounded together, \"but\r\ntaking care to first remove the heads and wings.\"[299] A multitude of\r\nprescriptions, of the same stamp most of them, are set down in this\r\nbook, which was still printed and considered as an authority at the\r\nRenaissance.\r\n\r\nBartholomew the Englishman,[300] another savant, yet more universal and\r\nmore celebrated, writes one of the oldest encyclopedias. His Latin book,\r\ntranslated into several languages, and of which there are many very\r\nbeautiful manuscripts,[301] comprises everything, from God and the\r\nangels down to beasts. Bartholomew teaches theology, philosophy,\r\ngeography, and history, the natural sciences, medicine, worldly\r\ncivility, and the art of waiting on table. Nothing is too high, or too\r\nlow, or too obscure for him; he is acquainted with the nature of angels,\r\nas well as with that of fleas: \"Fleas bite more sharply when it is going\r\nto rain.\" He knows about diamonds, \"stones of love and reconciliation\";\r\nand about man's dreams \"that vary according to the variation of the\r\nfumes that enter into the little chamber of his phantasy\"; and about\r\nheadaches that arise from \"hot choleric vapours, full of ventosity\"; and\r\nabout the moon, that, \"by the force of her dampness, sets her\r\nimpression in the air and engenders dew\"; and about everything in fact.\r\n\r\nThe jurists are numerous; through them again the action of Rome upon\r\nEngland is fortified. Even those among them who are most bent upon\r\nmaintaining the local laws and traditions, have constantly to refer to\r\nthe ancient law-makers and commentators; Roman law is for them a sort of\r\nprimordial and common treasure, open to all, and wherewith to fill the\r\ngaps of the native legislation. The first lessons had been given after\r\nthe Conquest by foreigners: the Italian Vacarius, brought by Theobald,\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury, had professed law at Oxford in 1149.[302] Then\r\nAnglo-Normans and English begin to codify and interpret their laws; they\r\nwrite general treatises; they collect precedents; and so well do they\r\nunderstand the utility of precedents that these continue to have in\r\nlegal matters, up to this day, an importance which no other nation has\r\ncredited them with. Ralph Glanville, Chief Justice under Henry II.,\r\nwrites or inspires a \"Treatise of the laws and customs of England\"[303];\r\nRichard, bishop of London, compiles a \"Dialogue of the Exchequer,\"[304]\r\nfull of wisdom, life, and even a sort of humour; Henry of Bracton,[305]\r\nthe most renowned of all, logician, observer, and thinker, composes in\r\nthe thirteenth century an ample treatise, of which several\r\nabridgments[306] were afterwards made for the convenience of the judges,\r\nand which is still consulted.\r\n\r\nIn the monasteries, the great literary occupation consists in the\r\ncompiling of chronicles. Historians of Latin tongue abounded in mediaeval\r\nEngland, nearly every abbey had its own. A register was prepared, with a\r\nloose leaf at the end, \"scedula,\" on which the daily events were\r\ninscribed in pencil, \"cum plumbo.\" At the end of the year the appointed\r\nchronicler, \"non quicumque voluerit, sed cui injunctum fuerit,\" shaped\r\nthese notes into a continued narrative, adding his remarks and comments,\r\nand inserting the entire text of the official documents sent by\r\nauthority for the monastery to keep, according to the custom of the\r\ntime.[307] In other cases, of rarer occurrence, a chronicle was compiled\r\nby some monk who, finding the life in cloister very dull, the offices\r\nvery long, and the prayers somewhat monotonous, used writing as a means\r\nof resisting temptations and ridding himself of vain thoughts and the\r\nremembrance of a former worldly life.[308] Thus there exists an almost\r\nuninterrupted series of English chronicles, written in Latin, from the\r\nConquest to the Renaissance. The most remarkable of these series is that\r\nof the great abbey of St. Albans, founded by Offa, a contemporary of\r\nCharlemagne, and rebuilt by Paul, a monk of Caen, who was abbot in 1077.\r\n\r\nMost of these chronicles are singularly impartial; the authors freely\r\njudge the English and the French, the king and the people, the Pope,\r\nHarold and William. They belong to that Latin country and that religious\r\nworld which had no frontiers. The cleverest among them are remarkable\r\nfor their knowledge of the ancients, for the high idea they conceive,\r\nfrom the twelfth century on, of the historical art, and for the pains\r\nthey take to describe manners and customs, to draw portraits and to\r\npreserve the memory of curious incidents. Thus shone, in the twelfth\r\ncentury, Orderic Vital, author of an \"Ecclesiastical History\" of\r\nEngland[309]; Eadmer, St. Anselm's biographer[310]; Gerald de Barry,\r\notherwise Geraldus Cambrensis; a fiery, bragging Welshman, who exhibited\r\nboth in his life and works the temperament of a Gascon[311]; William of\r\nMalmesbury,[312] Henry of Huntingdon,[313] &c.\r\n\r\nThese two last have a sort of passion for their art, and a deep\r\nveneration for the antique models. William of Malmesbury is especially\r\nworthy of remembrance and respect. Before beginning to write, he had\r\ncollected a multitude of books and testimonies; after writing he looks\r\nover and revises his text; he never considers, with famous Abbe Vertot,\r\nthat \"son siege est fait,\" that it is too late to mend. He is alive to\r\nthe interest offered for the historian by the customs of the people, and\r\nby these characteristic traits, scarcely perceptible sometimes, which\r\nare nevertheless landmarks in the journey of mankind towards\r\ncivilisation. His judgments are appreciative and thoughtful; he does\r\nsomething to keep awake the reader's attention, and notes down, with\r\nthis view, many anecdotes, some of which are excellent prose tales.\r\nSeven hundred years before Merimee, he tells in his own way the story of\r\nthe \"Venus d'Ille.\"[314] He does not reach the supreme heights of art,\r\nbut he walks in the right way; he does not know how to blend his hues,\r\nas others have done since, so as to delight the eye with many-coloured\r\nsights; but he already paints in colours. To please his reader, he\r\nsuddenly and naively says: \"Now, I will tell you a story. Once upon a\r\ntime....\" But if he has not been able to skilfully practice latter-day\r\nmethods, it is something to have tried, and so soon recognised the\r\nexcellence of them.\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth century rose above all others Matthew Paris,[315] an\r\nEnglish monk of the Abbey of St. Albans, who in his sincerity and\r\nconscientiousness, and in his love for the historical art, resembles\r\nWilliam of Malmesbury. He, too, wants to interest; a skilful\r\ndraughtsman, \"pictor peroptimus,\"[316] he illustrates his own\r\nmanuscripts; he depicts scenes of religious life, a Gothic shrine\r\ncarried by monks, which paralytics endeavour to touch, an architect\r\nreceiving the king's orders, an antique gem of the treasury of St.\r\nAlbans which, curiously enough, the convent lent pregnant women in order\r\nto assist them in child-birth; a strange animal, little known in\r\nEngland: \"a certain elephant,\"[317] drawn from nature, with a replica of\r\nhis trunk in another position, \"the first, he says, that had been seen\r\nin the country.\"[318] The animal came from Egypt, and was a gift from\r\nLouis IX. of France to Henry III. Matthew notes characteristic details\r\nshowing what manners were; he gives great attention to foreign affairs,\r\nand also collects anecdotes, for instance, of the wandering Jew, who\r\nstill lived in his time, a fact attested in his presence by an\r\nArchbishop of Armenia, who came to St. Albans in 1228. The porter of the\r\npraetorium struck Jesus saying: \"Go on faster, go on; why tarriest thou?\"\r\nJesus, turning, looked at him with a stern countenance and replied: \"I\r\ngo on, but thou shalt tarry till I come.\" Since then Cartaphilus\r\ntarries, and his life begins again with each successive century. Matthew\r\nprofits by the same occasion to find out about Noah's ark, and informs\r\nus that it was still to be seen, according to the testimony of this\r\nprelate, in Armenia.[319]\r\n\r\nIn the fourteenth century the most illustrious chroniclers were Ralph\r\nHigden, whose Universal History became a sort of standard work, was\r\ntranslated into English, printed at the Renaissance, and constantly\r\ncopied and quoted[320]; Walter of Hemingburgh, Robert of Avesbury,\r\nThomas Walsingham,[321] not to mention many anonymous authors. Several\r\namong the historians of that date, and Walsingham in particular, would,\r\non account of the dramatic vigour of their pictures, have held a\r\nconspicuous place in the literature of mediaeval England had they not\r\nwritten in Latin, like their predecessors.[322]\r\n\r\nFrom these facts, and from this ample, many-coloured literary growth,\r\nmay be gathered how complete the transformation was, and how strong the\r\nintellectual ties with Rome and Paris had become; also how greatly the\r\ninhabitants of England now differed from those Anglo-Saxons, that the\r\nvictors of Hastings had found \"agrestes et pene illiteratos,\" according\r\nto the testimony of Orderic Vital. Times are changed: \"The admirable\r\nMinerva visits human nations in turn ... she has abandoned Athens, she\r\nhas quitted Rome, she withdraws from Paris; she has now come to this\r\nisland of Britain, the most remarkable in the world; nay more, itself an\r\nepitome of the world.\"[323] Thus could speak concerning his country,\r\nabout the middle of the fourteenth century, when the results of the\r\nattempted experiment were certain and manifest, that great lover of\r\nbooks, a late student at Paris, who had been a fervent admirer of the\r\nFrench capital, Richard de Bury, Bishop of Durham.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[220] \"Volentes nos ipsos humiliare pro Illo Qui Se pro nobis humiliavit\r\nusque ad mortem ... offerimus et libere concedimus Deo et ... domino\r\nnostro papae Innocentio ejusque catholicis successoribus, totum regnum\r\nAngliae et totum regnum Hiberniae, cum omni jure et pertinentiis suis, pro\r\nremissione peccatorum nostrorum.\" Hereupon follows the pledge to pay for\r\never to the Holy See \"mille marcas sterlingorum,\" and then the oath of\r\nfealty to the Pope as suzerain of England.

Matthew was English; his\r\nsurname of \"Paris\" or \"the Parisian\" meant, perhaps, that he had studied\r\nat Paris, or perhaps that he belonged to one of the families of Paris\r\nwhich existed then in England (Jessopp, \"Studies by a Recluse,\" London,\r\n1893, p. 46). He was received into St. Albans monastery on 1217, and was\r\nsent on a mission to King Hacon in Norway in 1248-9. Henry III., a weak\r\nking but an artist born, valued him greatly. He died in 1259.

See below, p. 406.\r\n\r\n[321] See below, p. 405.\r\n\r\n[322] A great many other English chroniclers wrote in Latin, and among\r\ntheir number: Florence of Worcester, Simeon of Durham, Fitzstephen, the\r\npseudo Benedict of Peterborough, William of Newburgh, Roger de Hoveden\r\n(d. ab. 1201) in the twelfth century; Gervase of Canterbury, Radulph de\r\nDiceto, Roger de Wendover, Radulph de Coggeshall, John of Oxenede,\r\nBartholomew de Cotton, in the thirteenth; William Rishanger, John de\r\nTrokelowe, Nicolas Trivet, Richard of Cirencester, in the fourteenth. A\r\nlarge number of chronicles are anonymous. Most of those works have been\r\npublished by the English Historical Society, the Society of Antiquaries,\r\nand especially by the Master of the Rolls in the great collection: \"The\r\nChronicles and Memorials of Great Britain and Ireland ... published\r\nunder the direction of the Master of the Rolls,\" London, 1857 ff., in\r\nprogress. See also the \"Descriptive Catalogue of materials relating to\r\nthe History of Great Britain and Ireland, to the end of the reign of\r\nHenry VII.\" by Sir T. D. Hardy, Rolls, 1862-6, 3 vols. 8vo.\r\n\r\n[323] The contrast between the time when Richard writes and the days of\r\nhis youth, when he studied at Paris, is easy to explain. The Hundred\r\nYears' War had begun, and well could the bishop speak of the decay of\r\nstudies in the capital, \"ubi tepuit, immo fere friguit zelus scholae tam\r\nnobilis, cujus olim radii lucem dabant universis angulis orbis terrae....\r\nMinerva mirabilis nationes hominum circuire videtur....

To the disaster of Hastings succeeded, for the\r\nnative race, a period of stupor and silence, and this was not without\r\nsome happy results. The first duty of a master is to impose silence on\r\nhis pupils; and this the conquerors did not fail to do. There was\r\nsilence for a hundred years.\r\n\r\nThe clerks were the only exception; men of English speech remained mute.\r\nThey barely recopied the manuscripts of their ancient authors, the list\r\nof whose names was left closed; they listened without comprehending to\r\nthe songs the foreigner had acclimatised in their island. The manner of\r\nspeech and the subjects of the discourses were equally unfamiliar; and\r\nthey stood silent amidst the merriment that burst out like a note of\r\ndefiance in the literature of the victors.\r\n\r\nNecessity caused them to take up the pen once more. After as before the\r\nConquest the rational object of life continued to be the gaining of\r\nheaven, and it would have been a waste of time to use Latin in\r\ndemonstrating this truth to the common people of England. French served\r\nfor the new masters, and for their group of adherents; Latin for the\r\nclerks; but for the mass of \"lowe men,\" who are always the most\r\nnumerous, it was indispensable to talk English. \"All people cannot,\"\r\nhad said Bishop Grosseteste in his French \"Chateau d'Amour,\" \"know\r\nHebrew, Greek, and Latin\"--\"nor French,\" adds his English translator\r\nsome fifty years later; for which cause:\r\n\r\n    On Englisch I-chul mi resun schowen\r\n    Ffor him that con not i-knowen\r\n    Nouther Ffrench ne Latyn.[324]\r\n\r\nThe first works written in English, after the Conquest, were sermons and\r\npious treatises, some imitated from Bede, AElfric, and the ancient Saxon\r\nmodels, others translated from the French. No originality or invention;\r\nthe time is one of depression and humiliation; the victor sings, the\r\nvanquished prays.\r\n\r\nThe twelfth century, so fertile in Latin and French works, only counts,\r\nas far as English works are concerned, devotional books in prose and\r\nverse. The verses are uncouth and ill-shaped; the ancient rules,\r\nhalf-forgotten, are blended with new ones only half understood. Many\r\nauthors employ at the same time alliteration and rhyme, and sin against\r\nboth. The sermons are usually familiar in their style and kind in their\r\ntone; they are meant for the poor and miserable to whom tenderness and\r\nsympathy must be shown. The listeners want to be consoled and soothed;\r\nthey are also interested, as formerly, by stories of miracles, and\r\nscared into virtue by descriptions of hell; confidence again is given\r\nthem by instances of Divine mercy.[325]\r\n\r\nLike the ancient churches the collections of sermons bring before the\r\neye the last judgment and the region of hell, with its monstrous\r\ntorments, its wells of flames, its ocean with seven bitter waves: ice,\r\nfire, blood ... a rudimentary rendering of legends interpreted in their\r\nturn by Dante in his poem, and Giotto in his fresco.[326] The thought of\r\nGiotto especially, when reading those sermons, recurs to the memory, of\r\nGiotto with his awkward and audacious attempts, Giotto so remote and yet\r\nso modern, childish and noble at the same time, who represents devils\r\nroasting the damned on spits, and on the same wall tries to paint the\r\nUnseen and disclose to view the Unknown, Giotto with his search after\r\nthe impossible, an almost painful search, the opposite of antique\r\nwisdom, and the sublime folly of the then nascent modern age. Not far\r\nfrom Padua, beside Venice, in the great Byzantine mosaic of Torcello,\r\ncan be seen a last reflection of antique equanimity. Here the main\r\ncharacter of the judgment-scene is its grand solemnity; and from this\r\ncomes the impression of awe left on the beholder; the idea of rule and\r\nlaw predominates, a fatal law against which nothing can prevail; fate\r\nseems to preside, as it did in the antique tragedies.\r\n\r\nIn the English sermons of the period it is not the art of Torcello that\r\ncontinues, but the art of Giotto that begins. From time to time among\r\nthe ungainly phrases of an author whose language is yet unformed, amidst\r\nmild and kind counsels, bursts forth a resounding apostrophe which\r\ncauses the whole soul to vibrate, and has something sublime in its force\r\nand brevity: \"He who bestows alms with ill-gotten goods shall not obtain\r\nthe grace of Christ any more than he who having slain thy child brings\r\nthee its head as a gift!\"[327]\r\n\r\nThe Psalter,[328] portions of the Bible,[329] lives of saints,[330]\r\nwere put into verse. Metrical lives of saints fill manuscripts of\r\nprodigious size. A complete cycle of them, the work of several authors,\r\nin which are mixed together old and novel, English and foreign,\r\nmaterials, was written in English verse in the thirteenth century: \"The\r\ncollection in its complete state is a 'Liber Festivalis,' containing\r\nsermons or materials for sermons, for the festivals of the year in the\r\norder of the calendar, and comprehends not only saints' lives for\r\nsaints' days but also a 'Temporale' for the festivals of Christ,\"\r\n&c.[331] The earliest complete manuscript was written about 1300, an\r\nolder but incomplete one belongs to the years 1280-90, or\r\nthereabout.[332] In these collections a large place, as might be\r\nexpected, is allowed to English saints:\r\n\r\n    Wolle ye nouthe i-heore this englische tale | that is here i-write?\r\n\r\nIt is the story of St. Thomas Becket: \"Of Londone is fader was.\" St.\r\nEdward was \"in Engeland oure kyng\"; St. Kenelm,\r\n\r\n    Kyng he was in Engelond | of the march of Walis;\r\n\r\nSt. Edmund the Confessor \"that lith at Ponteneye,\"\r\n\r\n    Ibore he was in Engelond | in the toun of Abyndone.\r\n\r\nSt. Swithin \"was her of Engelonde;\" St. Wulfstan, bishop of Worcester,\r\n\r\n                                    Was here of Engelonde ...\r\n    The while he was a yong child | clene lif he ladde i-nough;\r\n    Whenne other children ornen to pleye | toward churche he drough.\r\n    Seint Edward was kyng tho | that nouthe in heovene is.\r\n\r\nSt. Cuthbert was born in England; St. Dunstan was an Englishman. Of the\r\nlatter a number of humorous legends were current among the people, and\r\nwere preserved by religious poets; he and the devil played on each other\r\nnumberless tricks in which, as behoves, the devil had the worst; these\r\nadventures made the subject of amusing pictures in many manuscripts. A\r\nwoman, of beautiful face and figure, calls upon the saint, who is\r\nclear-sighted enough to recognise under this alluring shape the\r\narch-foe; he dissembles. Being, like St. Eloi, a blacksmith, as well as\r\na saint and a State minister, he heats his tongs red-hot, and turning\r\nsuddenly round, while the other was watching confidently the effect of\r\nhis good looks, catches him by the nose. There was a smell of burnt\r\nflesh, and awful yells were heard many miles round, for the \"tonge was\r\nal afure\"; it will teach him to stay at home and blow his own nose:\r\n\r\n    As god the schrewe hadde ibeo | atom ysnyt his nose.[333]\r\n\r\nWith this we have graceful legends, like that of St. Brandan, adapted\r\nfrom a French original, being the story of that Irish monk who, in a\r\nleather bark, sailed in search of Paradise,[334] and visited marvellous\r\nislands where ewes govern themselves, and where the birds are angels\r\ntransformed. The optimistic ideal of the Celts reappears in this poem,\r\nthe subject of which is borrowed from them. \"All there is beautiful,\r\npure, and innocent; never was so kind a glance bestowed on the world,\r\nnot a cruel idea, not a trace of weakness or regret.\"[335]\r\n\r\nThe mirth of St. Dunstan's story, the serenity of the legend of St.\r\nBrandan, are examples rarely met with in this literature. Under the\r\nlight ornamentation copied from the Celts and Normans, is usually seen\r\nat that date the sombre and dreamy background of the Anglo-Saxon mind.\r\nHell and its torments, remorse for irreparable crimes, dread of the\r\nhereafter, terror of the judgments of God and the brevity of life, are,\r\nas they were before the Conquest, favourite subjects with the national\r\npoets. They recur to them again and again; French poems describing the\r\nsame are those they imitate the more willingly; the tollings of the\r\nfuneral bell are heard each day in their compositions. Why cling to this\r\nperishable world? it will pass as \"the schadewe that glyt away;\" man\r\nwill fade as a leaf, \"so lef on bouh.\" Where are Paris, and Helen, and\r\nTristan, and Iseult, and Caesar? They have fled out of this world as the\r\nshaft from the bowstring:\r\n\r\n    Heo beoth iglyden ut of the reyne,\r\n      So the scheft is of the cleo.[336]\r\n\r\nTreatises of various kinds, and pious poems, abound from the thirteenth\r\ncentury; all adapted to English life and taste, but imitated from the\r\nFrench. The \"Ancren Riwle,\"[337] or rule for Recluse women, written in\r\nprose in the thirteenth century is perhaps an exception: it would be in\r\nthat case the first in date of the original treatises written in English\r\nafter the Conquest. This Rule is a manual of piety for the use of women\r\nwho wish to dedicate themselves to God, a sort of \"Introduction a la Vie\r\ndevote,\" as mild in tone as that of St. Francis de Sales, but far more\r\nvigorous in its precepts. The author addresses himself specially to\r\nthree young women of good family, who had resolved to live apart from\r\nthe world without taking any vows. He teaches them to deprive themselves\r\nof all that makes life attractive; to take no pleasure either through\r\nthe eye, or through the ear, or in any other way. He gives rules for\r\ngetting up, for going to bed, for eating and for dressing. His doctrine\r\nmay be summed up in a word: he teaches self-renunciation. But he does it\r\nin so kindly and affectionate a tone that the life he wishes his\r\npenitents to submit to does not seem too bitter; his voice is so sweet\r\nthat the existence he describes seems almost sweet. Yet all that could\r\nbrighten it must be avoided; the least thing may have serious\r\nconsequences: \"of little waxeth mickle.\"\r\n\r\nNot a glance must be bestowed on the world; the young recluses must even\r\ndeny themselves the pleasure of looking out of the parlour windows. They\r\nmust bear in mind the example of Eve: \"When thou lookest upon a man thou\r\nart in Eve's case; thou lookest upon the apple. If any one had said to\r\nEve when she cast her eye upon it: 'Ah! Eve, turn thee away; thou\r\ncastest thine eyes upon thy death,' what would she have answered?--'My\r\ndear master, thou art in the wrong, why dost thou find fault with me?\r\nThe apple which I look upon is forbidden me to eat, not to look\r\nat.'--Thus would Eve quickly enough have answered. O my dear sisters,\r\ntruly Eve hath many daughters who imitate their mother, who answer in\r\nthis manner. But 'thinkest thou,' saith one, 'that I shall leap upon him\r\nthough I look at him?'--God knows, dear sisters, that a greater wonder\r\nhas happened. Eve, thy mother leaped after her eyes to the apple; from\r\nthe apple in Paradise down to the earth; from the earth to hell, where\r\nshe lay in prison four thousand years and more, she and her lord both,\r\nand taught all her offspring to leap after her to death without end. The\r\nbeginning and root of this woful calamity was a light look. Thus often,\r\nas is said, 'of little waxeth mickle.'\"[338]\r\n\r\nThe temptation to look and talk out of the window was one of the\r\ngreatest with the poor anchoresses; not a few found it impossible to\r\nresist it. Cut off from the changeable world, they could not help\r\nfeeling an interest in it, so captivating precisely because, unlike the\r\ncellular life, it was ever changing. The authors of rules for recluses\r\ninsisted therefore very much upon this danger, and denounced such abuses\r\nas Aelred, abbot of Rievaulx, reveals, as we have seen, so early as the\r\ntwelfth century: old women, talkative ones and newsbringers, sitting\r\nbefore the window of the recluse, \"and telling her tales, and feeding\r\nher with vain news and scandal, and telling her how this monk or that\r\nclerk or any other man looks and behaves.\"[339]\r\n\r\nMost of the religious treatises in English that have come down to us are\r\nof a more recent epoch, and belong to the first half of the fourteenth\r\ncentury. In the thirteenth, as has been noticed, many Englishmen\r\nconsidered French to be, together with Latin, the literary language of\r\nthe country; they endeavoured to handle it, but not always with great\r\nsuccess. Robert Grosseteste, who, however, recommended his clergy to\r\npreach in English, had composed in French a \"Chateau d'Amour,\" an\r\nallegorical poem, with keeps, castles, and turrets, \"les quatre tureles\r\nen haut,\" which are the four cardinal virtues, a sort of pious Romaunt\r\nof the Rose. William of Wadington had likewise written in French his\r\n\"Manuel des Pechiez,\" not without an inkling that his grammar and\r\nprosody might give cause for laughter. He excused himself in advance:\r\n\"For my French and my rhymes no one must blame me, for in England was I\r\nborn, and there bred and brought up and educated.\"[340]\r\n\r\nThese attempts become rare as we approach the fourteenth century, and\r\nEnglish translations and imitations, on the contrary, multiply. We find,\r\nfor example, translations in English verse of the \"Chateau\"[341] and the\r\n\"Manuel\"[342]; a prose translation of that famous \"Somme des Vices et\r\ndes Vertus,\" composed by Brother Lorens in 1279, for Philip III. of\r\nFrance, a copy of which, chained to a pillar of the church of the\r\nInnocents, remained open for the convenience of the faithful[343]; (a\r\nbestiary in verse, thirteenth century), devotional writings on the\r\nVirgin, legends of the Cross, visions of heaven and hell[344]; a Courier\r\nof the world, \"Cursor Mundi,\" in verse,[345] containing the history of\r\nthe Old and New Testaments. A multitude of legends are found in the\r\n\"Cursor,\" that of the Cross for instance, made out of three trees, a\r\ncypress, a cedar, and a pine, symbols of the Trinity. These trees had\r\nsprung from three pips given to Seth by the guardian angel of Paradise,\r\nand placed under Adam's tongue at his death; their miraculous existence\r\nis continued on the mountains, and they play a part in all the great\r\nepochs of Jewish history, in the time of Moses, Solomon, &c.\r\n\r\nSimilar legends adorn most of these books: what good could they\r\naccomplish if no one read them? And to be read it was necessary to\r\nplease. This is why verse was used to charm the ear, and romantic\r\nstories were inserted to delight the mind, for, says Robert Mannyng in\r\nhis translation of the \"Manuel des Pechiez,\" \"many people are so made\r\nthat it pleases them to hear stories and verses, in their games, in\r\ntheir feasts, and over their ale.\"[346]\r\n\r\nSomewhat above this group of translators and adaptators rises a more\r\noriginal writer, Richard Rolle of Hampole, noticeable for his English\r\nand Latin compositions, in prose and verse, and still more so by his\r\ncharacter.[347] He is the first on the list of those lay preachers, of\r\nwhom England has produced a number, whom an inward crisis brought back\r\nto God, and who roamed about the country as volunteer apostles,\r\nconverting the simple, edifying the wise, and, alas! affording cause for\r\nlaughter to the wicked. They are taken by good folks for saints, and for\r\nmadmen by sceptics: such was the fate of Richard Rolle, of George Fox,\r\nof Bunyan, and of Wesley; the same man lives on through the ages, and\r\nthe same humanity heaps on him at once blessings and ridicule.\r\n\r\nRichard was of the world, and never took orders. He had studied at\r\nOxford. One day he left his father's house, in order to give himself up\r\nto a contemplative life. From that time he mortifies himself, he fasts,\r\nhe prays, he is tempted; the devil appears to him under the form of a\r\nbeautiful young woman, who he tells us with less humility than we are\r\naccustomed to from him, \"loved me not a little with good love.\"[348] But\r\nthough the wicked one shows himself in this case even more wicked than\r\nwith St. Dunstan, and Rolle has no red-hot tongs to frighten him away,\r\nstill the devil is again worsted, and the adventure ends as it should.\r\n\r\nRolle has ecstasies, he sighs and groans; people come to visit him in\r\nhis solitude; he is found writing much, \"scribentem multum velociter.\"\r\nHe is requested to stop writing, and speak to his visitors; he talks to\r\nthem, but continues writing, \"and what he wrote differed entirely from\r\nwhat he said.\" This duplication of the personality lasted two hours.\r\n\r\nHe leaves his retreat and goes all over the country, preaching\r\nabnegation and a return to Christ. He finally settled at Hampole, where\r\nhe wrote his principal works, and died in 1349. Having no doubt that he\r\nwould one day be canonised, the nuns of a neighbouring convent caused\r\nthe office of his feast-day to be written; and this office, which was\r\nnever sung as Rolle never received the hoped-for dignity, is the main\r\nsource of our information concerning him.[349]\r\n\r\nHis style and ideas correspond well to such a life. His thoughts are\r\nsombre, Germanic anxieties and doubts reappear in his writings, the idea\r\nof death and the image of the grave cause him anguish that all his piety\r\ncannot allay. His style, like his life, is uneven and full of change; to\r\ncalm passages, to beautiful and edifying tales succeed bursts of\r\npassion; his phrases then become short and breathless; interjections and\r\napostrophes abound. \"Ihesu es thy name. A! A! that wondyrfull name! A!\r\nthat delittabyll name! This es the name that es abowve all names.... I\r\nyede (went) abowte be Covaytyse of riches and I fande noghte Ihesu. I\r\nrane be Wantonnes of flesche and I fand noghte Ihesu. I satt in\r\ncompanyes of Worldly myrthe and I fand noghte Ihesu.... Tharefore I\r\nturnede by anothire waye, and I rane a-bowte be Poverte, and I fande\r\nIhesu pure, borne in the worlde, laid in a crybe and lappid in\r\nclathis.\"[350] Rolle of Hampole is, if we except the doubtful case of\r\nthe \"Ancren Riwle, \"the first English prose writer after the Conquest\r\nwho can pretend to the title of original author. To find him we have had\r\nto come far into the fourteenth century. When he died, in 1349, Chaucer\r\nwas about ten years of age and Wyclif thirty.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nWe are getting further and further away from the Conquest, the wounds\r\ninflicted by it begin to heal, and an audience is slowly forming among\r\nthe English race, ready for something else besides sermons.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the nobles had early accepted the new order of\r\nthings, and had either retained or recovered their estates. Having\r\nrallied to the cause of the conquerors, they now endeavoured to imitate\r\nthem, and had also their castles, their minstrels, and their romances.\r\nThey had, it is true, learnt French, but English remained their natural\r\nlanguage. A literature was composed that resembled them, English in\r\nlanguage, as French as possible in dress and manners. About the end of\r\nthe twelfth century or beginning of the thirteenth, the translation of\r\nthe French romances began. First came war stories, then love tales.\r\n\r\nThus was written by Layamon, about 1205, the first metrical romance,\r\nafter \"Beowulf,\" that the English literature possesses.[351] The\r\nvocabulary of the \"Brut\" is Anglo-Saxon; there are not, it seems, above\r\nfifty words of French origin in the whole of this lengthy poem, and yet\r\non each page it is easy to recognise the ideas and the chivalrous tastes\r\nintroduced by the French. The strong will with which they blended the\r\ntraditions of the country has borne its fruits. Layamon considers that\r\nthe glories of the Britons are English glories, and he celebrates their\r\ntriumphs with an exulting heart, as if British victories were not Saxon\r\ndefeats. Bede, the Anglo-Saxon, and Wace, the Norman, \"a Frenchis clerc\"\r\nas he calls him, are, in his eyes, authorities of the same sort and same\r\nvalue, equally worthy of filial respect and belief. \"It came to him in\r\nmind,\" says Layamon, speaking of himself, \"and in his chief thought that\r\nhe would of the English tell the noble deeds.... Layamon began to\r\njourney wide over this land and procured the noble books which he took\r\nfor pattern. He took the English book that St. Bede made,\" and a Latin\r\nbook by \"St. Albin\"; a third book he took \"and laid in the midst, that a\r\nFrench clerk made, who was named Wace, who well could write.... These\r\nbooks he turned over the leaves, lovingly he beheld them ... pen he took\r\nwith fingers and wrote on book skin.\"[352] He follows mainly Wace's\r\npoem, but paraphrases it; he introduces legends that were unknown to\r\nWace, and adds speeches to the already numerous speeches of his model.\r\nThese discourses consist mostly of warlike invectives; before slaying,\r\nthe warriors hurl defiance at each other; after killing his foe, the\r\nvictor allows himself the pleasure of jeering at the corpse, and his\r\nmirth resembles very much the mirth in Scandinavian sagas. \"Then laughed\r\nArthur, the noble king, and gan to speak with gameful words: 'Lie now\r\nthere, Colgrim.... Thou climbed on this hill wondrously high, as if thou\r\nwouldst ascend to heaven, now thou shalt to hell. There thou mayest know\r\nmuch of your kindred; and greet thou there Hengest ... and Ossa, Octa\r\nand more of thy kin, and bid them there dwell winter and summer, and we\r\nshall in land live in bliss.'\"[353] This is an example of a speech\r\nadded to Wace, who simply concludes his account of the battle by:\r\n\r\n    Mors fu Balduf, mors fu Colgrin\r\n    Et Cheldric s'en ala fuiant.[354]\r\n\r\nIn such taunts is recognised the ferocity of the primitive epics, those\r\nof the Greeks as well as those of the northern nations. Thus spoke\r\nPatroclus to Cebrion when he fell headlong from his chariot, \"with the\r\nresolute air of a diver who seeks oysters under the sea.\"\r\n\r\nAfter Layamon, translations and adaptations soon become very plentiful,\r\nmetrical chronicles, like the one composed towards the end of the\r\nthirteenth century by Robert of Gloucester,[355] are compiled on the\r\npattern of the French ones, for the use and delight of the English\r\npeople; chivalrous romances are also written in English. The love of\r\nextraordinary adventures, and of the books that tell of them, had crept\r\nlittle by little into the hearts of these islanders, now reconciled to\r\ntheir masters, and led by them all over the world. The minstrels or\r\nwandering poets of English tongue are many in number; no feast is\r\ncomplete without their music and their songs; they are welcomed in the\r\ncastle halls, they can now, with as bold a voice as their French\r\nbrethren, bespeak a cup of ale, sure not to be refused:\r\n\r\n    At the beginning of ure tale,\r\n    Fil me a cuppe of ful god ale,\r\n    And y wile drinken her y spelle\r\n    That Crist us shilde all fro helle![356]\r\n\r\nThey stop also on the public places, where the common people flock to\r\nhear of Charlemagne and Roland[357]; they even get into the cloister. In\r\nthe thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, nearly all the stories of the\r\nheroes of Troy, Rome, France, and Britain are put into verse:\r\n\r\n    For hem that knowe no Frensche | ne never underston.[358]\r\n\r\n\"Men like,\" writes shortly after 1300, the author of the \"Cursor Mundi\":\r\n\r\n    Men lykyn jestis for to here\r\n    And romans rede in divers manere\r\n    Of Alexandre the conqueroure,\r\n    Of Julius Cesar the emperoure,\r\n    Of Grece and Troy the strong stryf\r\n    There many a man lost his lyf,\r\n    Of Brute that baron bold of hond,\r\n    The first conqueroure of Englond,\r\n    Of Kyng Artour....\r\n    How Kyng Charlis and Rowlond fawght\r\n    With Sarzyns nold they be cawght,\r\n    Of Trystrem and Isoude the swete,\r\n    How they with love first gan mete ...\r\n    Stories of diverce thynggis,\r\n    Of pryncis, prelatis and of kynggis,\r\n    Many songgis of divers ryme,\r\n    As English Frensh and Latyne.[359]\r\n\r\nSome very few Germanic or Saxon traditions, such as the story of\r\nHavelok, a Dane who ended by reigning in England, or that of Horn and\r\nRymenhild,[360] his betrothed, had been adopted by the French poets.\r\nThey were taken from them again by the English minstrels, who, however,\r\nleft these old heroes their French dress: had they not followed the\r\nfashion, no one would have cared for their work. Goldborough or\r\nArgentille, the heroine of the romance of Havelok, was originally a\r\nValkyria; now, under her French disguise, she is scarcely recognisable,\r\nbut she is liked as she is.[361]\r\n\r\nSome English heroes of a more recent period find also a place in this\r\npoetic pantheon, thanks again to French minstrels, who make them\r\nfashionable by versifying about them. In this manner were written, in\r\nFrench, then in English, the adventures of Waltheof, of Sir Guy of\r\nWarwick, who marries the beautiful Felice, goes to Palestine, kills the\r\ngiant Colbrant on his return, and dies piously in a hermitage.[362] Thus\r\nare likewise told the deeds of famous outlaws, as Fulke Fitz-Warin, a\r\nprototype of Robin Hood, who lived in the woods with the fair\r\nMahaud,[363] as Robin Hood will do later with Maid Marian.[364] Several\r\nof these heroes, Guy of Warwick in particular, enjoyed such lasting\r\npopularity that it has scarcely died out to this day. Their histories\r\nwere reprinted at the Renaissance; they were read under Elizabeth, and\r\nplays were taken from them; and when, with Defoe, Richardson, and\r\nFielding, novels of another kind took their place in the drawing-room,\r\ntheir life continued still in the lower sphere to which they had been\r\nconsigned. They supplied the matter for those popular _chap books_[365]\r\nthat have been reprinted even in our time, the authors of which wrote,\r\nas did the rhymers of the Middle Ages \"for the love of the English\r\npeople, of the people of merry England.\" _Englis lede of meri\r\nIngeland._[366]\r\n\r\n\"Merry England\" became acquainted with every form of French mirth; she\r\nimitated French chansons, and gave a place in her literature to French\r\nfabliaux. Nothing could be less congenial to the Anglo-Saxon race than\r\nthe spirit of the fabliaux. This spirit, however, was acclimatised in\r\nEngland; and, like several other products of the French mind, was\r\ngrafted on the original stock. The tree thus bore fruit which would\r\nnever have ripened as it did, without the Conquest. Such are the works\r\nof Chaucer, of Swift perhaps, and of Sterne. The most comic and _risque_\r\nstories, those same stories meant to raise a laugh which we have seen\r\nold women tell at parlour windows, in order to cheer recluse\r\nanchoresses, were put into English verse, from the thirteenth to the\r\nfifteenth century. Thus we find under an English form such stories as\r\nthe tale of \"La Chienne qui pleure,\"[367] \"Le lai du Cor,\"[368] \"La\r\nBourse pleine de sens,\"[369] the praise of the land of \"Coquaigne,\"[370]\r\n&c.:\r\n\r\n    Thogh paradis be miri and bright\r\n    Cokaygn is of fairir sight.\r\n    What is ther in paradis\r\n    Bot grasse and flure and grene ris (branches)?\r\n    Thogh ther be joi and grete dute (pleasure)\r\n    Ther nis mete bote frute....\r\n    Bot watir manis thurste to quenche;\r\n    Beth ther no man but two,\r\n    Hely and Enok also\r\n\r\nAnd it cannot be very pleasant to live without more company; one must\r\nfeel \"elinglich.\" But in \"Cokaygne\" there is no cause to be \"elinglich\";\r\nall is meat and drink there; all is day, there is no night:\r\n\r\n    Al is dai, nis ther no nighte,\r\n    Ther nis baret (quarrel) nother strif....\r\n    Ther nis man no womman wroth,\r\n    Ther nis serpent, wolf no fox;\r\n\r\nno storm, no rain, no wind, no flea, no fly; there is no Enoch nor any\r\nElias to be sure; but there are women with nothing pedantic about them,\r\nwho are as loving as they are lovable.\r\n\r\nNothing less Saxon than such poems, with their semi-impiety, which would\r\nbe absolute impiety if the author seriously meant what he said. It is\r\nthe impiety of Aucassin, who refuses (before it is offered him) to enter\r\nParadise: \"In Paradise what have I to win? Therein I seek not to enter,\r\nbut only to have Nicolete, my sweet lady that I love so well.... But\r\ninto Hell would I fain go; for into Hell fare the goodly clerks, and\r\ngoodly knights that fall in harness and great wars, and stout\r\nmen-at-arms, and all men noble.... With those would I gladly go, let me\r\nbut have with me Nicolete, my sweetest lady.\"[371] We must not take\r\nAucassin at his word; there was ever froth on French wine.\r\n\r\nOther English poems scoff at chivalrous manners, which are ridiculed in\r\nverse, in paintings, and sculptures[372]; or at the elegancies of the\r\nbad parson who puts in his bag a comb and \"a shewer\" (mirror).[373]\r\nOther poems are adaptations of the \"Roman de Renart.\"[374] The new\r\nspirit has penetrated so well into English minds that the adaptation is\r\nsometimes worthy of the original.\r\n\r\n    A vox gon out of the wode go,\r\n    Afingret (hungered) so that him wes wo;\r\n    He nes (ne was) nevere in none wise\r\n    Afingret erour (before) half so swithe.\r\n    He ne hoeld nouther wey ne strete,\r\n    For him wes loth men to mete;\r\n    Him were levere meten one hen,\r\n    Than half an oundred wimmen.\r\n\r\nBut not a hen does he come across; they are suspicious, and roost out of\r\nreach. At last, half dead, he desires to drink, and sees a well with two\r\npails on the chain; he descends in one of the pails, and finds it\r\nimpossible to scramble out: he weeps for rage. The wolf, as a matter of\r\ncourse, comes that way, and they begin to talk. Though wanting very much\r\nto go, hungrier than ever, and determined to make the wolf take his\r\nplace, Renard would not have been Renard had he played off this trick on\r\nhis gossip plainly and without a word. He adds many words, all sparkling\r\nwith the wit of France, the wit that is to be inherited by Scapin and\r\nby Figaro. The wolf, for his part, replies word for word by a verse of\r\nOrgon's. Renard will only allow him to descend into the Paradise whither\r\nhe pretends to have retired, after he has confessed, forgiven all his\r\nenemies--Renard being one--and is ready to lead a holy life. Ysengrin\r\nagrees, confesses, and forgives; he feels his mind quite at rest, and\r\nexclaims in his own way:\r\n\r\n    Et je verrais mourir frere, enfants, mere et femme,\r\n    Que je m'en soucierais autant que de cela.[375]\r\n\r\n      Nou ich am in clene live,\r\n      Ne recche ich of childe ne of wive.\r\n\r\nThe wolf goes down, Renard goes up; as the pails meet, the rogue\r\nwickedly observes:\r\n\r\n    Ac ich am therof glad and blithe\r\n    That thou art nomen in clene live,\r\n    Thi soul-cnul (knell) ich wile do ringe,\r\n    And masse for thine soule singe.\r\n\r\nBut he considers it enough for his purpose to warn the monks that the\r\ndevil is at the bottom of their well. With great difficulty the monks\r\ndraw up the devil, which done they beat him, and set the dogs on him.\r\n\r\nSome graceful love tales, popular in France, were translated and enjoyed\r\nno less popularity in England, where there was now a public for\r\nliterature of this sort. Such was the case for Amis and Amile, Floire\r\nand Blanchefleur, and many others.[376] As for _chansons_, there were\r\nimitations of May songs, \"disputoisons,\"[377] and carols; love, roses,\r\nand birds were sung in sweet words to soft music[378]; so was spring,\r\nthe season of lilies, when the flowers give more perfume, and the moon\r\nmore light, and women are more beautiful:\r\n\r\n    Wymmen waxeth wonder proude.[379]\r\n\r\nTheir beauties and merits are celebrated one by one, as in a litany;\r\nfor, said one of those poets, an Englishman who wrote in French:\r\n\r\n    Beaute de femme passe rose.[380]\r\n\r\nIn honour of them were composed stanzas spangled with admiring\r\nepithets, glittering like a golden shower; innumerable songs were\r\ndedicated to their ideal model, the Queen of Angels; others to each one\r\nof their physical charms, their \"vair eyes\"[381] and their eyes \"gray\r\ny-noh\": those being the colours preferred; their skin white as milk,\r\n\"soft ase sylk\"; those scarlet lips that served them to read romances,\r\nfor romances were read aloud, and not only with the eyes[382]; their\r\nvoice more melodious than a bird's song. In short, from the time of\r\nEdward II. that mixture of mysticism and sensuality appears which was to\r\nbecome one of the characteristics of the fourteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe poets who made these songs, charming as they were, rarely succeeded\r\nhowever in perfectly imitating the light pace of the careless French\r\nmuse. In reading a great number of the songs of both countries, one is\r\nstruck by the difference. The English spring is mixed with winter, and\r\nthe French with summer; England sings the verses of May, remembering\r\nApril, France sings them looking forward to June.\r\n\r\n    Blow northerne wynd,\r\n    Sent thou me my suetyng,\r\n    Blow, northerne wynd, blou, blou, blou![383]\r\n\r\nsays the English poet. Contact with the new-comers had modified the\r\ngravity of the Anglo-Saxons, but without sweeping it away wholly and for\r\never: the possibility of recurring sadness is felt even in the midst of\r\nthe joy of \"Merry England.\"\r\n\r\nBut the hour draws near when for the first time, and in spite of all\r\ndoleful notes, the joy of \"Merry England\" will bloom forth freely.\r\nEdward III. is on the throne, Chaucer is just born, and soon the future\r\nBlack Prince will win his spurs at Crecy.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[324] \"Castel of Love,\" \"made in the latter half of the XIIIth century,\"\r\nin Horstmann and Furnivall, \"Minor Poems of the Vernon MS.,\" E.E.T.S.,\r\n1892, Part I. p. 356, see below, p. 213.

The events take place at Lincoln, Grimsby, and in Denmark; the\r\nseal of Grimsby engraved in the thirteenth century represents, besides\r\n\"Habloc\" and \"Goldeburgh,\" \"Gryem,\" the founder of the town, and\r\nsupposed father of the hero.

His story was told in a French poem,\r\nwritten before 1314 and turned into prose before 1320 (the text, though\r\nin French, is remarkable for its strong English bias); an English poem\r\non the same subject is lost.

The French are no longer superposed on the\r\nnatives; henceforth there are only English in the English island.\r\n\r\nUntil the fourteenth year of Edward III.'s reign, whenever a murder was\r\ncommitted and the authors of it remained unknown, the victim was _prima\r\nfacie_ assumed to be French, \"Francigena,\" and the whole county was\r\nfined. But the county was allowed to prove, if it could, that the dead\r\nman was only an Englishman, and in that case there was nothing to pay.\r\nBracton, in the thirteenth century, is very positive; an inquest was\r\nnecessary, \"ut sciri possit utrum interfectus _Anglicus_ fuerit, vel\r\n_Francigena_.\"[384] The _Anglicus_ and the _Francigena_ therefore still\r\nsubsisted, and were not equal before the law. The rule had not fallen\r\ninto disuse, since a formal statute was needed to repeal it; the statute\r\nof 1340, which abolishes the \"presentement d'Englescherie,\"[385] thus\r\nsweeping away one of the most conspicuous marks left behind by the\r\nConquest.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time the fusion of idioms took place, and the English\r\nlanguage was definitively constituted. At the beginning of the\r\nfourteenth century, towards 1311, the text of the king's oath was to be\r\nfound in Latin among the State documents, and a note was added declaring\r\nthat \"if the king was illiterate,\" he was to swear in French[386]; it\r\nwas in the latter tongue that Edward II. took his oath in 1307; the idea\r\nthat it could be sworn in English did not occur. But when the century\r\nwas closing, in 1399, an exactly opposite phenomenon happened. Henry of\r\nLancaster usurped the throne and, in the Parliament assembled at\r\nWestminster, pronounced in English the solemn words by which he claimed\r\nthe crown: \"In the name of Fadir, Son and Holy Gost, I, Henry of\r\nLancastre, chalenge yis Rewme of Yngland.\"[387]\r\n\r\nDuring this interval, the union of the two languages had taken place.\r\nThe work of aggregation can be followed in its various phases, and\r\nalmost from year to year. In the first half of the century, the \"lowe\r\nmen,\" the \"rustics,\" _rurales homines_, are still keen to learn French,\r\n_satagunt omni nisu_; they wish to frenchify, _francigenare_,[388]\r\nthemselves, in order to imitate the nobles, and be more thought of.\r\nTheir efforts had a remarkable result, precisely for the reason that\r\nthey never succeeded in speaking pure French, and that in their\r\nill-cleared brains the two languages were never kept distinctly apart.\r\nThe nobles, cleverer men, could speak both idioms without confounding\r\nthem, but so could not these _rurales_, who lisped the master's tongue\r\nwith difficulty, mixing together the two vocabularies and the two\r\ngrammars, mistaking the genders, assigning, for want of better\r\nknowledge, the neuter to all the words that did not designate beings\r\nwith a sex, in other words, strange as it may seem, creating the new\r\nlanguage. It was on the lips of \"lowe men\" that the fusion first began;\r\nthey are the real founders of modern English; the \"French of\r\nStratford-at-Bow\" had not less to do with it than the \"French of Paris.\"\r\n\r\nEven the nobles had not been able to completely escape the consequences\r\nof a perpetual contact with the _rurales_. Had these latter been\r\nutterly ignorant of French, the language of the master would have been\r\nkept purer, but they spoke the French idiom after a fashion, and their\r\nmanner of speaking it had a contagious influence on that of the great.\r\nIn the best families, the children being in constant communication\r\nwith native servants and young peasants, spoke the idiom of France\r\nless and less correctly. From the end of the thirteenth century and\r\nthe beginning of the fourteenth, they confuse French words that bear\r\na resemblance to each other, and then also commences for them that\r\nannoyance to which so many English children have been subjected, from\r\ngeneration to generation down to our time: the difficulty of knowing\r\nwhen to say _mon_ and _ma_--\"kaunt dewunt dire moun et ma\"--that\r\nis how to distinguish the genders. They have to be taught by manuals,\r\nand the popularity of one written by Walter de Biblesworth,[389] in the\r\nfourteenth century, shows how greatly such treatises were needed. \"Dear\r\nsister,\" writes Walter to the Lady Dionyse de Montchensy, \"I have\r\ncomposed this work so that your children can know the properties of\r\nthe things they see, and also when to say _mon_ and _ma_, _son_ and\r\n_sa_, _le_ and _la_, _moi_ and _je_.\" And he goes on showing at the\r\nsame time the maze and the way out of it: \"You have _la levre_ and\r\n_le lievre_; and _la livre_ and _le livre_. The _levre_ closes the teeth\r\nin; _le lievre_ the woods inhabits; _la livre_ is used in trade; _le\r\nlivre_ is used at church.\"[390]\r\n\r\nInextricable difficulties! And all the harder to unravel that\r\nAnglo-Saxon too had genders, equally arbitrary, which did not agree with\r\nthe French ones. It is easy to conceive that among the various\r\ncompromises effected between the two idioms, from which English was\r\nfinally to emerge, the principal should be the suppression of this\r\ncumbersome distinction of genders.\r\n\r\nWhat happened in the manor happened also in the courts of justice. There\r\nFrench was likewise spoken, it being the rule, and the trials were\r\napparently not lacking in liveliness, witness this judge whom we see\r\nparaphrasing the usual formula: \"Allez a Dieu,\" or \"Adieu,\" and wishing\r\nthe defendant, none other than the bishop of Chester, to \"go to the\r\ngreat devil\"--\"Allez au grant deable.\"[391]--(\"'What,' said Ponocrates,\r\n'brother John, do you swear?' 'It is only,' said the monk, 'to adorn my\r\nspeech. These are colours of Ciceronian rhetoric.'\")--But from most of\r\nthe speeches registered in French in the \"Year-books,\" it is easily\r\ngathered that advocates, _serjeants_ as they were called, did not\r\nexpress themselves without difficulty, and that they delivered in French\r\nwhat they had thought in English.\r\n\r\nTheir trouble goes on increasing. In 1300 a regulation in force at\r\nOxford allowed people who had to speak in a suit to express themselves\r\nin \"_any_ language generally understood.\"[392] In the second half of the\r\ncentury, the difficulties have reached such a pitch that a reform\r\nbecomes indispensable; counsel and clients no longer understand each\r\nother. In 1362, a statute ordains that henceforward all pleas shall be\r\nconducted in English, and they shall be enrolled in Latin; and that in\r\nthe English law courts \"the French language, which is too unknown in the\r\nsaid realm,\"[393] shall be discontinued.\r\n\r\nThis ignorance is now notorious. Froissart remarks on it; the English,\r\nhe says, do not observe treaties faithfully, \"and to this they are\r\ninclined by their not understanding very well all the terms of the\r\nlanguage of France; and one does not know how to force a thing into\r\ntheir head unless it be all to their advantage.\"[394] Trevisa, about\r\nthe same time, translating into English the chronicle of Ralph Higden,\r\nreaches the passage where it is said that all the country people\r\nendeavour to learn French, and inserts a note to rectify the statement.\r\nThis manner, he writes, is since the great pestilence (1349) \"sumdel\r\ni-chaunged,\" and to-day, in the year 1385, \"in alle the gramere scoles\r\nof Engelond, children leveth Frensche and construeth and lerneth an\r\nEnglische.\" This allows them to make rapid progress; but now they\r\n\"conneth na more Frensche than can hir (their) lift heele, and that is\r\nharme for hem, and (if) they schulle passe the see and travaille in\r\nstraunge landes and in many other places. Also gentil men haveth now\r\nmoche i-left for to teche here children Frensche.\"[395]\r\n\r\nThe English themselves laugh at their French; they are conscious of\r\nspeaking, like Chaucer's Prioress, the French of Stratford-at-Bow, or,\r\nlike Avarice in the \"Visions\" of Langland, that \"of the ferthest end of\r\nNorfolke.\"[396]\r\n\r\nThere will shortly be found in the kingdom personages of importance,\r\nexceptions it is true, with whom it will be impossible to negotiate in\r\nFrench. This is the case with the ambassadors sent by Henry IV., that\r\nsame Henry of Lancaster who had claimed the crown by an English speech,\r\nto Flanders and France in 1404. They beseech the \"Paternitates ac\r\nMagnificentias\" of the Grand Council of France to answer them in Latin,\r\nFrench being \"like Hebrew\" to them; but the Magnificents of the Grand\r\nCouncil, conforming to a tradition which has remained unbroken down to\r\nour day, refuse to employ for the negotiation any language but their\r\nown.[397] Was it not still, as in the time of Brunetto Latini, the\r\nmodern tongue most prized in Europe? In England even, men were found who\r\nagreed to this, while rendering to Latin the tribute due to it; and the\r\nauthor of one of the numerous treatises composed in this country for the\r\nbenefit of those who wished to keep up their knowledge of French said:\r\n\"Sweet French is the finest and most graceful tongue, the noblest speech\r\nin the world after school Latin, and the one most esteemed and beloved\r\nby all people.... And it can be well compared to the speech of the\r\nangels of heaven for its great sweetness and beauty.\"[398]\r\n\r\nIn spite of these praises, the end of French, as the language \"most\r\nesteemed and beloved,\" was near at hand in England. Poets like Gower\r\nstill use it in the fourteenth century for their ballads, and prose\r\nwriters like the author of the \"Croniques de London\"[399]; but these are\r\nexceptions. It remains the idiom of the Court and the great; the Black\r\nPrince writes in French the verses that will be graven on his tomb:\r\nthese are nothing but curious cases. Better instructed than the lawyers\r\nand suitors in the courts of justice, the members of Parliament continue\r\nto use it; but English makes its appearance even among them, and in 1363\r\nthe Chancellor has opened the session by a speech in English, the first\r\never heard in Westminster.\r\n\r\nThe survival of French was at last nothing but an elegance; it was still\r\nlearnt, but only as Madame de Sevigne studied Italian, \"pour entretenir\r\nnoblesse.\" Among the upper class the knowledge of French was a\r\ntraditional accomplishment, and it has continued to be one to our day.\r\nAt the beginning of the sixteenth century the laws were still, according\r\nto habit, written in French; but complaints on this score were made to\r\nHenry VIII., and his subjects pointed out to him that this token of the\r\nancient subjection of England to the Normans of France should be\r\nremoved. This mark has disappeared, not however without leaving some\r\ntrace behind, as laws continue to be assented to by the sovereign in\r\nFrench: \"La Reine le veut.\" They are vetoed in the same manner: \"La\r\nReine s'avisera\"; though this last manner is less frequently resorted to\r\nthan in the time of the Plantagenets.\r\n\r\nFrench disappears. It does not disappear so much because it is forgotten\r\nas because it is gradually absorbed. It disappears, and so does the\r\nAnglo-Saxon; a new language is forming, an offspring of the two others,\r\nbut distinct from them, with a new grammar, versification, and\r\nvocabulary. It less resembles the Anglo-Saxon of Alfred's time than the\r\nItalian of Dante resembles Latin.\r\n\r\nThe vocabulary is deeply modified. It numbered before the Conquest a few\r\nwords of Latin origin, but not many; they were words recalling the great\r\nworks of the Romans, such as _street_ and _chester_, from _strata_ and\r\n_castrum_, or else words borrowed from the language of the clerks, and\r\nconcerning mainly religion, such as _mynster_, _tempel_, _bisceop_,\r\nderived from _monasterium_, _templum_, _episcopus_, &c. The Conquest was\r\nproductive of a great change, but not all at once; the languages, as has\r\nbeen seen, remained at first distinctly separate; then in the\r\nthirteenth, and especially in the fourteenth century, they permeated\r\neach other, and were blended in one. In 1205, only fifty words of Latin\r\norigin were found in the sixteen thousand long lines of Layamon's\r\n\"Brut\"; a hundred can be counted in the first five hundred lines of\r\nRobert of Gloucester about 1298, and a hundred and seventy in the first\r\nfive hundred lines of Robert Mannyng of Brunne, in 1303.[400]\r\n\r\nAs we advance further into the fourteenth century, the change is still\r\nmore rapid. Numerous families of words are naturalised in England, and\r\nlittle by little is constituted that language the vocabulary of which\r\ncontains to-day twice as many words drawn from French or Latin as from\r\nGermanic sources. At the end of Skeat's \"Etymological Dictionary,\"[401]\r\nthere is a table of the words of the language classified according to\r\ntheir derivation; the words borrowed from Germanic or Scandinavian\r\nidioms fill seven columns and a half; those taken from the French, and\r\nthe Romance or classic tongues, sixteen columns.\r\n\r\nIt is true the proportion of words used in a page of ordinary English\r\ndoes not correspond to these figures. With some authors in truth it is\r\nsimply reversed; with Shakespeare, for instance, or with Tennyson, who\r\nexhibit a marked predilection for Anglo-Saxon words. It is nevertheless\r\nto be observed: first, that the constitution of the vocabulary with its\r\nmajority of Franco-Latin words is an actual fact; then that in a page of\r\nordinary English the proportion of words having a Germanic origin is\r\nincreased by the number of Anglo-Saxon articles, conjunctions, and\r\npronouns, words that are merely the servants of the others, and are, as\r\nthey should be, more numerous than their masters. A nearer approach to\r\nthe numbers supplied by the lists of Skeat will be made if real words\r\nonly are counted, those which are free and independent citizens of the\r\nlanguage, and not the shadow nor the reflection of any other.\r\n\r\nThe contributive part of French in the new vocabulary corresponds to the\r\nbranches of activity reserved to the new-comers. From their maternal\r\nidiom have been borrowed the words that composed the language of war, of\r\ncommerce, of jurisprudence, of science, of art, of metaphysics, of pure\r\nthought, and also the language of games, of pastimes, of tourneys, and\r\nof chivalry. In some cases no compromise took place, neither the French\r\nnor the Anglo-Saxon word would give way and die, and they have both come\r\ndown to us, alive and irreducible: _act_ and _deed_; _captive_ and\r\n_thrall_; _chief_ and _head_, &c.[402] It is a trace of the Conquest,\r\nlike the formula: \"La Reine le veut.\"\r\n\r\nChaucer, in whose time these double survivals were naturally far more\r\nnumerous than they are to-day, often uses both words at once, sure of\r\nbeing thus intelligible to all:\r\n\r\n    They callen love a woodnes or a folye.[403]\r\n\r\nVersification is transformed in the same proportion; here again the two\r\nprosodies arrive at a compromise. Native verse had two ornaments: the\r\nnumber of accents and alliteration; French verse in the fourteenth\r\ncentury had also two ornaments, the number of syllables and rhyme. The\r\nFrench gave up their strict number of syllables, and consented to note\r\nthe number of accents; the natives discarded alliteration and accepted\r\nrhyme in its stead. Thus was English verse created, its cadence being\r\nGermanic and its rhyme French, and such was the prosody of Chaucer, who\r\nwrote his \"Canterbury Tales\" in rhymed English verse, with five accents,\r\nbut with syllables varying in number from nine to eleven.\r\n\r\nThe fusion of the two versifications was as gradual as that of the two\r\nvocabularies had been. Layamon in the thirteenth century mingled both\r\nprosodies in his \"Brut,\" sometimes using alliteration, sometimes rhyme,\r\nand occasionally both at once. The fourteenth century is the last in\r\nwhich alliterative verse really flourished, though it survived even\r\nbeyond the Renaissance. In the sixteenth century a new form was tried;\r\nrhyme was suppressed mainly in imitation of the Italians and the\r\nancients, and blank verse was created, which Shakespeare and Milton used\r\nin their masterpieces; but alliteration never found place again in the\r\nnormal prosody of England.\r\n\r\nGrammar was affected in the same way. In the Anglo-Saxon grammar, nouns\r\nand adjectives had declensions as in German; and not very simple ones.\r\n\"Not only had our old adjectives a declension in three genders, but more\r\nthan this, it had a double set of trigeneric inflexions, Definite and\r\nIndefinite, Strong and Weak, just like that which makes the beginner's\r\ndespair in German.\"[404] Verbs were conjugated without auxiliaries; and\r\nas there was no particular inflection to indicate the future, the\r\npresent was used instead, a very indifferent substitute, which did not\r\ncontribute much to the clearness of the phrase. Degrees of comparison in\r\nthe adjectives were marked, not by adverbs, as in French, but by\r\ndifferences in the terminations. In short, the relations of words to\r\neach other, as well as the particular part they had to play in the\r\nphrase, were not indicated by other special words, prepositions, adverbs\r\nor auxiliaries, those useful menials, but by variations in the endings\r\nof the terms themselves, that is, by inflections. The necessity for a\r\ncompromise with the French, which had lost its primitive declensions and\r\ninflections, hastened an already begun transformation and resulted in\r\nthe new language's possessing in the fourteenth century a grammar\r\nremarkably simple, brief and clear. Auxiliaries were introduced, and\r\nthey allowed every shade of action, action that has been, or is, or will\r\nbe, or would be, to be clearly defined. The gender of nouns used to\r\npresent all the singularities which are one of the troubles in German or\r\nFrench; _mona_, moon, was masculine as in German; _sunne_, sun, was\r\nfeminine; _wif_, wife, was not feminine but neuter; as was also _maeden_,\r\nmaiden. \"A German gentleman,\" as \"Philologus,\" has so well observed,\r\n\"writes a masculine letter of feminine love to a neuter young lady with\r\na feminine pen and feminine ink on masculine sheets of neuter paper, and\r\nencloses it in a masculine envelope with a feminine address to his\r\ndarling, though neuter, Gretchen. He has a masculine head, a feminine\r\nhand, and a neuter heart.\"[405] Anglo-Saxon gentlemen were in about the\r\nsame predicament, before William the Conqueror came in his own way to\r\ntheir help and rescued them from this maze. In the transaction which\r\ntook place, the Anglo-Saxon and the French both gave up the\r\narbitrariness of their genders; nouns denoting male beings became\r\nmasculine, those denoting female beings became feminine; all the others\r\nbecame neuter; _wife_ and _maiden_ resumed their sex, while _nation_,\r\n_sun_ and _moon_ were neuter. Nouns and adjectives lost their\r\ndeclensions; adjectives ceased to vary in their endings according to the\r\nnouns they were attached to, and yet the clearness of the phrase was not\r\nin the least obscured.\r\n\r\nIn the same way as with the prosody and vocabulary, these changes were\r\neffected by degrees. Great confusion prevailed in the thirteenth\r\ncentury; the authors of the \"Brut\" and the \"Ancren Riwle\" have visibly\r\nno fixed ideas on the use of inflections, or on the distinctions of the\r\ngenders. Only under Edward III. and Richard II. were the main principles\r\nestablished upon which English grammar rests. As happened also for the\r\nvocabulary, in certain exceptional cases the French and the Saxon uses\r\nhave been both preserved. The possessive case, for instance, can be\r\nexpressed either by means of a proposition, in French fashion: \"The\r\nworks of Shakespeare,\" or by means of the ancient genitive:\r\n\"Shakespeare's works.\"\r\n\r\nThus was formed the new language out of a combination of the two others.\r\nIn our time, moved by a patriotic but rather preposterous feeling, some\r\nhave tried to react against the consequences of the Conquest, and undo\r\nthe work of eight centuries. They have endeavoured to exclude from their\r\nwritings words of Franco-Latin origin, in order to use only those\r\nderived from the Anglo-Saxon spring. A vain undertaking: the progress of\r\na ship cannot be stopped by putting one's shoulder to the bulkheads; a\r\nsingular misapprehension of history besides. The English people is the\r\noffspring of two nations; it has a father and a mother, whose union has\r\nbeen fruitful if stormy; and the parent disowned by some to-day, under\r\ncover of filial tenderness, is perhaps not the one who devoted the least\r\ncare in forming and instructing the common posterity of both.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nThe race and the language are transformed; the nation also, considered\r\nas a political body, undergoes change. Until the fourteenth century, the\r\ncentre of thought, of desire, and of ambition was, according to the\r\nvocation of each, Rome, Paris, or that movable, ever-shifting centre,\r\nthe Court of the king. Light, strength, and advancement in the world all\r\nproceeded from these various centres. In the fourteenth century, what\r\ntook place for the race and language takes place also for the nation. It\r\ncoalesces and condenses; it becomes conscious of its own limits; it\r\ndiscerns and maintains them. The action of Rome is circumscribed;\r\nappeals to the pontifical Court are prohibited,[406] and, though they\r\nstill continue to be made, the oft-expressed wish of the nation is that\r\nthe king should be judge, not the pope; it is the beginning of the\r\nreligious supremacy of the English sovereigns. Oxford has grown; it is\r\nno longer indispensable to go to Paris in order to learn. Limits are\r\nestablished: the wars with France are royal and not national ones.\r\nEdward III., having assumed the title of king of France, his subjects\r\ncompel him to declare that their allegiance is only owed to him as king\r\nof England, and not as king of France.[407] No longer is the nation\r\nAnglo-French, Norman, Angevin, or Gascon; it is English; the nebula\r\ncondenses into a star.\r\n\r\nThe first consequences of the Conquest had been to bind England to the\r\ncivilisations of the south. The experiment had proved a successful one,\r\nthe results obtained were definitive; there was no need to go further,\r\nthe ties could now without harm slacken or break. Owing to that\r\nevolutionary movement perpetually evinced in human affairs, this first\r\nexperiment having been perfected after a lapse of three hundred years, a\r\ncounter-experiment now begins. A new centre, unknown till then,\r\ngradually draws to itself every one's attention; it will soon attract\r\nthe eyes of the English in preference to Rome, Paris, or even the king's\r\nCourt. This new centre is Westminster. There, an institution derived\r\nfrom French and Saxonic sources, but destined to be abortive in France,\r\nis developed to an extent unparalleled in any other country. Parliament,\r\nwhich was, at the end of the thirteenth century, in an embryonic state,\r\nis found at the end of the fourteenth completely constituted, endowed\r\nwith all its actual elements, with power, prerogatives, and an influence\r\nin the State that it has rarely surpassed at any time.\r\n\r\nNot in vain have the Normans, Angevins, and Gascons given to the men of\r\nthe land the example of their clever and shrewd practice. Not in vain\r\nhave they blended the two races into one: their peculiar characteristics\r\nhave been infused into their new compatriots: so much so that from the\r\nfirst day Parliament begins to feel conscious of its strength, it\r\ndisplays bias most astonishing to behold: it thinks and acts and behaves\r\nas an assembly of Normans. The once violent and vacillating\r\nAnglo-Saxons, easily roused to enthusiasm and brought down to despair,\r\nnow calculate, consider, deliberate, do nothing in haste, act with\r\ndiplomatic subtlety, _bargain_. All compromises between the Court and\r\nParliament, in the fourteenth century, are a series of bargains;\r\nParliament pays on condition that the king reforms; nothing for nothing;\r\nand the fulfilling of the bargain is minutely watched. It comes to this\r\nat last, that Parliament proves more Norman than the Court; it\r\nmanoeuvres with more skill, and remains master of the situation; \"a\r\nNormand, Normand et demi.\" The Plantagenets behold with astonishment the\r\nrise of a power they are now unable to control; their offspring is\r\nhardy, and strong, and beats its nurse.\r\n\r\nAfter the attempts of Simon de Montfort, Edward I. had convened, in\r\n1295, the first real Parliament. He had reasserted the fundamental\r\nprinciple of all liberties, by appropriating to himself the old maxim\r\nfrom Justinian's code, according to which \"what touches the interests of\r\nall must be approved by all.\"[408] He forms the habit of appealing to\r\nthe people; he wants them to know the truth, and decide according to\r\ntruth which is in the right, whether the king or his turbulent\r\nbarons[409]; he behaves on occasion as if he felt that _over_ him was\r\nthe nation. And this strange sight is seen: the descendant of the Norman\r\nautocrats modestly explains his plans for war in Flanders and in\r\nFrance, excuses himself for the aid he is obliged to ask of his\r\nsubjects, and even condescends to solicit the spiritual benefit of their\r\nprayers: \"He the king, on this and on the state of himself and of his\r\nrealm, and how the business of his realm has come to nothing, makes it\r\nknown and wants that all know the truth, which is as follows.... He can\r\nneither defend himself nor his realm without the help of his good\r\npeople. And it grieves him sorely to have them, on this account, so\r\nheavily charged.... And he prays them to take as an excuse for what he\r\nhas done, that that he did not do in order to buy lands and tenements,\r\nor castles and towns, but to defend himself, and them, and the whole\r\nkingdom.... And as he has great faith that the good prayers of his good\r\npeople will help him very much in bringing this business to a good end,\r\nhe begs that they will intently pray for him and those that with him\r\ngo.\"[410]\r\n\r\nAt first, Parliament is astonished: such excess of honour alarms it;\r\nthen it understands the chance that offers, and guesses that in the\r\nproffered bargain it may very well be the winner. This once understood,\r\nprogress is rapid, and from year to year can be observed the growth of\r\nits definitive privileges. The Commons have their Speaker, \"M. Thomas de\r\nHungerford, knight, who had the words for the Commons of England\"[411];\r\nthey want deputies to be elected by \"due election,\" and they protest\r\nagainst all interference of the Government; against official\r\ncandidatures, and against the election of royal functionaries. On\r\ndifficult questions, the members request to be allowed to return to\r\ntheir counties and consult with their constituents before voting.[412]\r\nIn spite of all the aristocratic ideas with which they are still imbued,\r\nmany of those audacious members who clamour for reforms and oppose the\r\nking are very inconsiderable people, and such men are seen taking their\r\nseats at Westminster as \"Walterus l'espicer,\" \"Paganus le tailour,\"\r\n\"Radulphus le teynturer,\" \"Ricardus orfevre.\"[413]\r\n\r\nGreat is the power of this mixed gathering. No new taxes can be levied\r\nwithout its consent; every individual, every personage, every authority\r\nhaving a petition to present, or a complaint to make, sends it to the\r\nassembly of Westminster. The king consults it on peace or war: \"So,\"\r\nsays the Chamberlain to the Commons in 1354, \"you are willing to assent\r\nto a permanent treaty of peace, if one can be obtained? And the said\r\nCommons answered entirely and unanimously: Yes, yes! (Oil! Oil!)\"[414]\r\n\r\nNothing is too great or too small for Parliament to attend to; the\r\nsovereign appeals to it, and the clergy too, and beggars also. In 1330,\r\nthe poor, the \"poverail\" of Greenwich, complain that alms are no longer\r\nbestowed on them as formerly, to the great detriment, say they, of the\r\nsouls of the benefactors of the place \"who are in Purgatory.\"[415]\r\nConvents claim privileges that time has effaced; servants ask for their\r\nwages; the barber of Edward II. solicits the maintenance of favours\r\ngranted by a prince he had bled and shaved for twenty-six years.[416]\r\n\r\nAnd before the same gathering of men, far different quarrels are brought\r\nforth. The king's ministers, Latymer and Neville, are impeached; his\r\nmistress Alice Perrers hears sentence[417]; his household, personal\r\nattendants and expenses are reformed; and from then can be foreseen a\r\ntime when, owing to the tread of centuries, the king will reign but no\r\nlonger govern. Such is almost the case even in the fourteenth century.\r\nParliament deposes Richard II., who fancied himself king by right\r\ndivine, and claimed, long before the Stuarts, to hold his crown, \"del\r\ndoun de Dieu,\" as a \"gift of God.\"[418] In the list of grievances drawn\r\nup by the assembly to justify the deposition, figures the assertion\r\nattributed to the king \"that the laws proceeded from his lips or from\r\nhis heart, and that he alone could make or alter the laws of his\r\nkingdom.\"[419] In 1399 such language was already held to be criminal in\r\nEngland. In 1527 Claude Gaillard, prime President of the Parliament of\r\nParis, says in his remonstrance to Francis I., king of France: \"We do\r\nnot wish, Sire, to doubt or question your power; it would be a kind of\r\nsacrilege, and we well know you are above all law, and that statutes\r\nand ordinances cannot touch you.... \"[420] The ideas on political\r\n\"sacrilege\" differed widely in the two countries.\r\n\r\nFrom the end of the fourteenth century, an Englishman could already say\r\nas he does to-day: My business is not the business of the State, but the\r\nbusiness of the State is my business. The whole of the English\r\nconstitution, from the vote on the taxes to the _habeas corpus_, is\r\ncomprised in this formula. In France the nation, practical, lucid, and\r\nlogical in so many things, but easily amused, and too fond of chansons,\r\nneglected the opportunities that offered; the elect failed to attend the\r\nsittings; the bargains struck were not kept to. The Westminster\r\nParliament voted subsidies on condition that reforms would be\r\ninstituted; the people paid and the king reformed. In France, on the\r\ncontrary, during the Middle Ages, the people tried not to pay, and the\r\nking tried not to reform. Thus the levying of the subsidy voted by the\r\nStates-General of 1356-7, was the cause of bloody riots in France; the\r\npeople, unenlightened as to their own interests, did their best to\r\ndestroy their defenders: the agents of the States-General were massacred\r\nat Rouen and Arras; King John \"the Good\" published a decree forbidding\r\nthe orders of the States to be fulfilled, and acquired instant\r\npopularity by this the most tyrannic measure of all his reign.\r\n\r\nThese differences between the two political bodies had important\r\nconsequences with regard to the development of thought in the two\r\ncountries; they also excited the wonder and sometimes the admiration of\r\nthe French. \"The king of England must obey his subjects,\" says\r\nFroissart, \"and do all they want him to.\"[421] \"To my mind,\" writes\r\nCommines, \"of all the communities I know in the world, the one where\r\npublic business is best attended to, where the people are least exposed\r\nto violence, where there are no buildings ruined and pulled down on\r\naccount of wars, that one is England.\"[422] \"The English are the masters\r\nof their king,\" writes Ambassador Courtin in 1665, in almost the same\r\nwords as Froissart, \"their king can do nothing, unless what he wants is\r\nwhat they will.\"[423]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nNow are the vanquished and the victors of Hastings blended into one\r\nnation, and they are endowed with a Parliament as a safeguard for their\r\nliberties. \"This is,\" Montesquieu said later, \"the nation in the world\r\nthat has best known how to avail itself at the same time of those three\r\ngreat things: religion, trade, and liberty.\"[424] Four hundred years\r\nbefore Montesquieu it already availed itself of these three great\r\nthings; under Edward and Richard Plantagenets, England was what it has\r\never been since, a \"merchant island.\"[425]\r\n\r\nIts mines are worked, even those of \"sea-coal,\" as it was then called,\r\n\"carboun de meer.\"[426] It has a numerous mercantile navy which carries\r\nto the Baltic, to Iceland, to Flanders, to Guyenne, and to Spain, wool,\r\nskins, cloth, wheat, butter and cheese, \"buyre et furmage.\" Each year\r\nthe galleys of Venice come laden with cotton, silks from Damascus,\r\nsugar, spices, perfumes, ivory, and glass. The great commercial houses,\r\nand the merchant corporations are powers in the State; Edward III.\r\ngrants to the London gilds the right of electing members to Parliament,\r\nand they preserved this right until the Reform Bill of 1832. The wealthy\r\nmerchants lent money to the king; they were called to his councils; they\r\nbehaved as great citizens. Anthony Blache lends Edward III. 11,720\r\npounds; the Blankets of Bristol gather enormous wealth; John Blanket\r\ndies in 1405, bequeathing a third of his fortune to his wife, a third to\r\nhis children, and a third to the poor; John Philpot, a grocer of London,\r\nembarks on his ships and fights for the kingdom; Richard Whittington, he\r\nof the legendary cat, is famed in history for his wealth and liberality,\r\nand was mayor of London in 1398, 1406, and 1419. These merchants are\r\nennobled, and from their stock spring earls and dukes; the De la Poles,\r\nwool-merchants of Hull, mortgage their property for the king. William de\r\nla Pole rescues Edward III., detained in Flanders by want of money, and\r\nis made a knight-banneret; his son Michael is created earl of Suffolk;\r\none of his grandsons is killed at Agincourt; another besieges Orleans,\r\nwhich is delivered by Joan of Arc; he becomes duke of Suffolk, is\r\nimpeached in 1450 for high treason and beheaded; no honour is lacking to\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of the Edwards, the Commons are very touchy upon the\r\nsubject of the maritime power and glory of their country; they already\r\nconsider the ocean as their appointed realm. Do they observe, or fancy\r\nthey observe, any diminution in the strength of England? They complain\r\nto the king in remonstrances more than once heard again, word for word,\r\nwithin the halls of Westminster: \"Twenty years ago, and always before,\r\nthe shipping of the Realm was in all the ports and good towns upon the\r\nsea or rivers, so noble and plenteous that all the countries held and\r\ncalled our said sovereign, the King of the Sea.\"[427] At this time,\r\n1372, the country is, without possibility of doubt, the England of the\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\nFrom that period the English are found either singly or in small bands\r\non all the seas and on all the highways.[428] Their nature has been\r\nmodified; the island no longer suffices them as it sufficed the\r\nAnglo-Saxons. \"Il ne sait rien, qui ne va hors\"--he knows nothing who\r\nstirs not out--think they with Des Champs; they are keen to see what\r\ngoes on elsewhere, and like practical folks to profit by it. When the\r\nopportunity is good they seize it, whatsoever its nature; encountering\r\nSaracens they slay them: so much towards Paradise; moving about in Italy\r\nthey are not long in discovering the advantages offered by a\r\ncondottiere's existence. They adopt and even perfect it, and after their\r\ndeath are magnificently buried in the cathedral of Florence, and Paolo\r\nUccello paints their portrait on the wall.[429] On every occasion they\r\nbehave like Normans; in the halls of Westminster, in their City counting\r\nhouses, on the highroads of Italy and on the ocean they everywhere\r\nresemble the rulers whose spirit has passed into them, and prove\r\nthemselves to be at once adventurous and practical. \"They are good\r\nwalkers and good horsemen,\" said Ralph Higden of them in the fourteenth\r\ncentury, adding: \"They are curious, and like to tell the wonders they\r\nhave seen and observed.\" How many books of travel we owe to this\r\npropensity! \"They roam over all lands,\" he continues, \"and succeed still\r\nbetter in other countries than in their own.... They spread over the\r\nearth; every land they inhabit becomes as their own country.\"[430] They\r\nare themselves, and no longer seek to be any one else; they cease by\r\ndegrees to _francigenare_. This combination of boldness and obstinacy\r\nthat is theirs, is the blend of qualities by which distant settlements\r\ncan be established and kept; to these qualities must be traced the\r\nfounding of the English colonial empire, and the power which allowed the\r\nPlantagenet kings to aspire, as early as the fourteenth century, to be\r\nthe \"Rois de la Mier.\"\r\n\r\nTrade brings luxury, comfort, and the love of art in its train. The same\r\nhappened in London as in Venice, Florence, and Bruges; these merchants\r\nand nobles were fond of beautiful things. It is an era of prosperity for\r\nimagers, miniaturists, painters, and sculptors.[431] The wealthy order\r\nto be chiselled for themselves ivory Virgins whose tender, half-mundane\r\nsmile, is not less charming for the doubt it leaves whether it is of\r\nearth or of heaven; devotional tablets in painted ivory, in gold, or\r\ntranslucid enamels; golden goblets with figures, silver cups \"enamelled\r\nwith children's games,\" salt-cellars in the shape of lions or dogs,\r\n\"golden images of St. John the Baptist, in the wilderness,\"[432] all\r\nthose precious articles with which our museums are filled. Edward II.\r\nsends to the Pope in 1317, among other gifts, a golden ewer and basin,\r\nstudded with translucid enamels, supplied by Roger de Frowyk, a London\r\ngoldsmith, for the price of one hundred and forty-seven pounds, Humphrey\r\nde Bohun, who died in 1361, said his prayers to beads of gold; Edward\r\nIII. played chess on a board of jasper and crystal, silver mounted. The\r\nminiaturists represent Paradise on the margin of missals, or set forth\r\nin colours some graceful legend or fantastic tale, with knights,\r\nflowers, and butterflies.[433] In spite of foreign wars, local\r\ninsurrections, the plague that returns periodically, 1349, 1362, 1369,\r\n1375, the great uprising of the peasantry, 1381, the troubles and\r\nmassacres which followed, art prospers in the fourteenth century, and\r\nwhat chiefly characterises it is that it is all a-smile.\r\n\r\nThat such things were coeval is not so astonishing as it may seem. Life\r\nwas still at that time so fragile and so often threatened, that the\r\nnotion of its being suddenly cut off was a familiar one even from\r\nchildhood. Wars, plagues, and massacres never took one unawares; they\r\nwere in the due course of things, and were expected; the possibility of\r\nsuch misfortunes saddened less in prospective than it does now that they\r\nhave become less frequent. People were then always ready to fight, to\r\nkill, and to be killed. Games resembled battles, and battles games: the\r\nfavourite exercises were tournaments; life was risked for nothing, as an\r\namusement. Innumerable decrees[434] forbade those pastimes on account of\r\nthe deaths they caused, and the troubles they occasioned; but the\r\namusement was the best available, and the decrees were left unobserved.\r\nEdward starts on his war to France, and his knights, following his\r\nexample, take their falconers and their hounds along with them, as\r\nthough they were going to a hunt.[435] Never was felt to a greater\r\ndegree what Rabelais terms \"the scorn of fortuitous things.\" Times have\r\nchanged, and until we go back to a similar state of affairs, which is\r\nnot impossible, we come into the world with ideas of peace and order,\r\nand of a life likely to be a long one. We are indignant if it is\r\nthreatened, very sad when the end draws near; with more lasting\r\nhappinesses we smile less often. Froissart paints in radiant colours,\r\nand the subject of his pictures is the France of the Hundred Years' War.\r\nThe \"merry England\" of the \"Cursor Mundi\" and after is the England of\r\nthe great plagues, and of the rising of the peasants, which had two\r\nkings assassinated out of four. It is also the England whose Madonnas\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\nIn architecture the English favour the development of that kind of\r\nspecial Gothic of which they are the inventors, the Perpendicular, a\r\nrich and well-ordered style, terrestrial, practical, pleasant to look\r\nupon. No one did more to secure it a lasting fame than the Chancellor of\r\nEdward III. and of Richard II., William of Wykeham, bishop of\r\nWinchester, the restorer of Windsor, founder of New College at Oxford,\r\nthe greatest builder of the century.[436] The walls and vaulted roofs of\r\nchapels are thick inlaid with ornaments; broad windows let in different\r\ncoloured lights through their stained-glass panes; golden-haired angels\r\nstart from the cornices; architecture smiles too, and its smile, like\r\nthat of the Madonnas, is half religious and half mundane.\r\n\r\nLess care is taken to raise strong houses than formerly; among the\r\nnumerous castles with which the land bristles may be seen, in the\r\ndistant valley where the ancient town of St. David's lies screened, a\r\nbishop's palace that would have suited neither William de Longchamp nor\r\nHugh de Puiset, a magnificent dwelling, without towers of defence, or\r\nmoats, or drawbridges, an exceptional dwelling, built as though the\r\ninhabitants were already secure of the morrow.[437]\r\n\r\nThe outside is less rude, and the inside is adorned and enriched; life\r\nbecomes more private than it used to be; existence less patriarchal and\r\nmore refined; those who still cling to old customs complain that the\r\nrich man dines in a chamber with a chimney, and leaves the large hall\r\nwhich was made for men to take their meals in together.[438] The walls\r\nof these chambers with chimneys are painted or covered with hangings;\r\ntapestries represent (as do those of Edward II.) the king surrounded by\r\nhis nobles,[439] or (like those of the Black Prince) the \"Pas de\r\nSaladin,\" or \"sea-sirens,\" with a border of \"swans with ladies' heads,\"\r\nin other words, chimeras, \"and ostrich feathers\"; or, again, like those\r\nof Sir John Falstofe, in the following century, the adoration of the\r\nshepherds, a hawking scene, the siege of Falaise (taken in 1417), a\r\nwoman playing the harp near a castle, \"a giant piercing a boar with a\r\nspear\": all of which are the more noticeable as they are nothing but\r\nliterature put into colours or embroidery.[440]\r\n\r\nThe conveniences and elegancies of the table are now attended to; cooks\r\nwrite out their recipes in English; stewards draw up in the same\r\nlanguage protocols concerning precedence, and the rules which a\r\nwell-trained servant should observe. Such a one does not scratch his\r\nhead, and avoids sneezing in the dish; he abstains from wiping the\r\nplates with his tongue, and in carving takes the meat in his left hand\r\nand the knife in his right, forks being then unknown; he gives each one\r\nhis proper place, and remembers \"that the Pope hath no peere.\" When the\r\nmaster dresses, he must be seated on a chair by the fire, a \"kercheff\"\r\nis spread over his shoulders, and he is \"curteisly\" combed with an ivory\r\ncomb; he is rinsed \"with rose-watur warme\"; when he takes a bath the air\r\nis scented with herbs hanging from the ceiling. When he goes to bed the\r\ncats and dogs which happen to be in his room should be driven away, or\r\nelse a little cloth provided for them.\r\n\r\nThe food is rich and combines extraordinary mixtures. Hens and rabbits\r\nare eaten chopped up with pounded almonds, raisins, sugar, ginger, herbs\r\ndipped in grease, onions and salt; if the mixture is not thick enough,\r\nrice flour is added, and the whole coloured with saffron. Cranes,\r\nherons, and peacocks are cooked with ginger. Great attention is paid to\r\noutward appearance and to colour; the dishes must be yellow or green, or\r\nadorned with leaves of gold and silver, a fashion still preserved in the\r\nEast. Elaborate cakes, \"subtleties\" as they were then termed, are also\r\nserved; they represent:\r\n\r\n    Maydon Mary that holy virgyne\r\n    And Gabrielle gretynge hur with an Ave.[441]\r\n\r\nPeople adorn their bodies as well as their houses; luxury in dress is\r\ncarried to such an excess that Parliament finds it necessary to\r\ninterfere, and forbids women of the lower classes to wear any furs\r\nexcept cat and rabbit.[442] Edward III. buys of master Paul de Monteflor\r\ngowns for the queen, in \"stuffs from over the sea,\" to the enormous\r\namount of 1,330 pounds. He himself wears a velvet waistcoat, on which he\r\nhas caused golden pelicans to be embroidered by William Courtenay, a\r\nLondon embroiderer. He gives his mistress Alice Perrers 21,868 large\r\npearls, and thirty ounces of smaller ones. His daughter Margaret\r\nreceives from him two thousand pearls as a wedding present; he buys his\r\nsister Alienor a gilded carriage, tapestried and embroidered, with\r\ncushions and curtains of silk, for which he pays one thousand\r\npounds.[443] At that time one might for the same sum have bought a herd\r\nof sixteen hundred oxen.\r\n\r\nThe sense of beauty, together with a reverence for and a worship of it,\r\nwas spreading among the nation whose thoughts shortly before used to run\r\nin quite different lines. Attention is paid to physical beauty, such as\r\nit had never received before. Men and women wear tight garments, showing\r\nthe shape of the figure. In the verses he composed for his tomb at\r\nCanterbury, the Black Prince mourns over \"his beauty which has all\r\ngone.\" Richard II., while still alive, has graven on his tomb that he\r\nwas \"corpore procerus.\"[444] The taste of the English for finery becomes\r\nso well known, that to them is ascribed, even in France, the invention\r\nof new fashions. Recalling to his daughters, in order to teach them\r\nmodesty, that \"the deluge in the time of Noah happened for the pride and\r\ndisguises of men, and mostly of women, who remodelled their shapes by\r\nmeans of gowns and attire,\" the Knight de la Tour Landry gives the\r\nEnglish ladies the credit, or rather the discredit, of having invented\r\nthe immeasurable head-dresses worn at that day. It is an evil sign; in\r\nthat country people amuse themselves too much: \"In England many there\r\nare that have been blamed, the report goes, I know not whether it is\r\nwrongly or rightly.\"[445]\r\n\r\nOwing to the attention paid to physical beauty in England, sculptors now\r\nbegin--a rare thing at that time--to have living models, and to copy the\r\nnude. In the abbey of Meaux, \"Melsa,\" near Beverley, on the banks of the\r\nHumber, was seen in the fourteenth century a sight that would have been\r\nrather sought for by the banks of the Arno, under the indulgent sky of\r\nItaly. The abbot Hugh of Leven having ordered a new crucifix for the\r\nconvent chapel, the artist \"had always a naked man under his eyes, and\r\nhe strove to give to his crucifix the beauty of form of his model.\"[446]\r\n\r\nOne last trait may be added to the others: not only the beauty of live\r\nbeings, but that also of inanimate things is felt and cared for, the\r\nbeauty of landscapes, and of trees. In 1350-1 the Commons complain of\r\nthe cutting down of the large trees overshadowing the houses, those\r\nlarge trees, dear already to English hearts, and point out in Parliament\r\nthe loss of this beauty, the great \"damage, loss, and blemish\" that\r\nresults from it for the dwellings.[447]\r\n\r\nIn nearly every respect, thus, the Englishman of to-day is formed, and\r\nreceives his chief features, under the Angevin princes Edward III. and\r\nRichard II.: practical, adventurous, a lover of freedom, a great\r\ntraveller, a wealthy merchant, an excellent sailor. We have had a\r\nglimpse of what he is; let us now listen to what he says.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[384] \"De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae,\" book iii. treatise ii.\r\nchap. xv.

By his origin, his\r\neducation, his tastes, his manner of life, as well as by his writings,\r\nChaucer represents the new age; he paints it from nature, and is a part\r\nof it. His biography is scarcely less characteristic than his works, for\r\nhe describes nothing through hearsay or imagination. He is himself an\r\nactor in the scenes he depicts; he does not dream, he sees them.\r\n\r\nHis history is a sort of reduction of that of the English people at that\r\nday. They are enriched by trade, and Chaucer, the son of merchants,\r\ngrows up among them. The English people no longer repair to Paris in\r\norder to study, and Chaucer does not go either; their king wages war in\r\nFrance, and Chaucer follows Edward along the military roads of that\r\ncountry; they put more and more trust in Parliament, and Chaucer sits in\r\nParliament as member for Kent. They take an interest in things of\r\nbeauty, they are fond of the arts, and want them to be all aglow with\r\nornamentation and bright with smiles; Chaucer is clerk of the king's\r\nworks, and superintends the repairs and embellishments of the royal\r\npalaces. Saxon monotony, the sadness that followed after Hastings, are\r\nforgotten past memory; this new England knows how to laugh and also how\r\nto smile; she is a merry England, with bursts of joy, and also an\r\nEngland of legends, of sweet songs, and of merciful Madonnas. The\r\nEngland of laughter and the England of smiles are both in Chaucer's\r\nworks.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nChaucer's life exactly fills the period we have now come to, during\r\nwhich the English people acquired their definitive characteristics: he\r\nwas born under Edward III. and he died shortly after the accession of\r\nHenry of Lancaster. At that time Petrarch and Boccaccio were long since\r\ndead, France had no poet of renown, and Chaucer was without comparison\r\nthe greatest poet of Europe.\r\n\r\nHis family belonged to the merchant class of the City. His father, John\r\nChaucer, his uncle, Thomas Heyroun, and other relations besides, were\r\nmembers of the Corporation of Wine Merchants, or Vintners. John Chaucer\r\nwas purveyor to the Court, and he accompanied Edward III. on his first\r\nexpedition to the Continent: hence a connection with the royal family,\r\nby which the future poet was to profit. The Chaucers' establishment was\r\nsituated in that Thames Street which still exists, but now counts only\r\nmodern houses; Geoffrey was probably born there in 1340, or a little\r\nearlier.[448]\r\n\r\nChaucer spent the years of his childhood and youth in London: a London\r\nwhich the great fire of 1666 almost totally destroyed, that old London,\r\nthen quite young, of which illuminated manuscripts have preserved to us\r\nthe picturesque aspect. The paternal house was near the river, and by\r\nthe side of the streamlet called Walbrook, since covered over, but which\r\nthen flowed in the open air. On the noble river, the waters of which\r\nwere perhaps not as blue as illuminators painted them, but which were\r\nnot yet the liquid mud we all know, ships from the Mediterranean and the\r\nBaltic glided slowly, borne by the tide. Houses with several stories and\r\npointed roofs lined the water, and formed, on the ground floor,\r\ncolonnades that served for warehouses, and under which merchandise was\r\nlanded.[449] The famous London Bridge, built under King John, almost new\r\nstill, for it was only entering upon its second century and was to live\r\nsix hundred years, with its many piers, its sharp buttresses, the houses\r\nit bore, its chapel of St. Thomas, stood against the line of the\r\nhorizon, and connected the City with the suburb of Southwark. On that\r\nside were more houses, a fine Gothic church, which still exists,\r\nhostelries in abundance, for it was the place of arrival for those\r\ncoming by land; and with the hostelries, places of amusement of every\r\nkind, a tradition so well established that most of the theatres in the\r\ntime of Elizabeth were built there, and notably the celebrated Globe,\r\nwhere Shakespeare's plays were performed. Save for this suburb, the\r\nright shore of the Thames, instead of the warehouses of to-day, offered\r\nto view the open country, trees, and green meadows. Some way down, on\r\nthe left side, rose the walls of the Tower; and further up, towards the\r\ninterior of the City, the massive pile of St. Paul's stood out above the\r\nhouses. It was then a Gothic cathedral; Wren, after the great fire,\r\nreplaced it by the Renaissance edifice we see to-day. The town was\r\nsurrounded by walls, portions of which still remain, with Roman\r\nfoundations in some places.[450] At intervals gates opened on the\r\ncountry, defended by bastions, their memory being preserved at this day\r\nby names of streets: Aldgate, Bishopsgate, &c.\r\n\r\nThe town itself was populous and busy. The streets, in which Chaucer's\r\nchildhood was spent, were narrow, bordered by houses with projecting\r\nstories, with signs overhanging the way, with \"pentys\" barring the\r\nfootpath, and all sorts of obstructions, against which innumerable\r\nmunicipal ordinances protested in vain. Riders' heads caught in the\r\nsigns, and it was enjoined to make the poles shorter; manners being\r\nviolent, the wearing of arms was prohibited, but honest folk alone\r\nconformed to the law, thus facilitating matters for the others;\r\ncleanliness was but indifferent; pigs ran hither and thither. A decree\r\nof the time of Edward I. had vainly prescribed that they should all be\r\nkilled, except those of St. Anthony's Hospital, which would be\r\nrecognised by the bell hanging at their neck: \"And whoso will keep a\r\npig, let him keep it in his own house.\" Even this privilege was\r\nwithdrawn a little later, so elegant were manners becoming.[451]\r\n\r\nIn this laborious city, among sailors and merchants, acquiring a taste\r\nfor adventure and for tales of distant lands, hearing his father\r\ndescribe the beautiful things to be seen at Court, Geoffrey grew up,\r\nfrom a child became a youth, and, thanks to his family's acquaintances,\r\nwas appointed, at seventeen, page to Elizabeth, wife of Lionel, son of\r\nEdward III.[452] In his turn, and not as a merchant, he had access to\r\nthe Court and belonged to it. He dressed in the fashion, and spent seven\r\nshillings for a short cloak or paltock, shoes, and a pair of red and\r\nblack breeches.\r\n\r\nIn 1359 he took part in the expedition to France, led by the king. It\r\nseemed as if it must be a death-blow to the French: the disaster of\r\nPoictiers was not yet repaired; the Jacquerie had just taken place, as\r\nwell as the Parisian riots and the betrayal and death of Marcel; the\r\nking of France was a prisoner in London, and the kingdom had for its\r\nleader a youth of twenty-two, frail, learned, pious, unskilled in war.\r\nIt looked as though one had but to take; but once more the saying of\r\nFroissart was verified; in the fragile breast of the dauphin beat the\r\nheart of a great citizen, and the event proved that the kingdom was not\r\n\"so discomfited but that one always found therein some one against whom\r\nto fight.\" The campaign was a happy one neither for Edward nor for\r\nChaucer. The king of England met with nothing but failures: he failed\r\nbefore Reims, failed before Paris, and was only too pleased to sign the\r\ntreaty of Bretigny. Chaucer was taken by the French,[453] and his fate\r\nwould not have been an enviable one if the king had not paid his ransom.\r\nEdward gave sixteen pounds to recover his daughter-in-law's page.\r\nEverything has its value: the same Edward had spent fifty pounds over a\r\nhorse called Bayard, and seventy for another called Labryt, which was\r\ndapple-grey.\r\n\r\nAfter his return Chaucer was attached to the person of Edward in the\r\ncapacity of valet of the chamber, \"valettus camerae regis\"; this is\r\nexactly the title that Moliere was later to honour in his turn. His\r\nfunctions consisted in making the royal bed, holding torches, and\r\ncarrying messages. A little later he was squire, _armiger_, _scutifer_,\r\nand as such served the prince at table, and rode after him in his\r\njourneys.[454] His duties do not seem to have absorbed all his thoughts,\r\nfor he found time to read many books, to write many poems, to be madly\r\nenamoured of a lovely unknown person who did not respond to his\r\npassion,[455] to marry \"Domicella\" or \"Damoiselle\" Philippa, attached to\r\nthe service of the queen, then to the service of Constance, second wife\r\nof John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster--without ceasing however, because he\r\ncould not, as he assures us, do otherwise, still to love his unknown\r\nbeauty.[456]\r\n\r\nHe reads, he loves, he writes, he is a poet. We do not know whom he\r\nloved, but we know what he read and what he wrote at that time. He read\r\nthe works which were in fashion in the elegant society he lived among:\r\nromances of chivalry, love-songs, allegorical poems, from \"Roland\" and\r\n\"Tristan\" to the \"Roman de la Rose.\" Poets, even the greatest, rarely\r\nshow their originality at twenty, and Chaucer was no exception to the\r\nrule; he imitated the writings best liked by those around him, which, at\r\nthe Court of the king, were mostly French books. However it might be\r\nwith the nation, the princes had remained French; the French language\r\nwas their native tongue; the beautiful books, richly illustrated, that\r\nthey kept to divert themselves with on dull days, in their\r\n\"withdrawing-room,\" or \"chambre de retrait,\" were French books, of which\r\nthe subject for the most part was love. In this respect there was, even\r\nat that time, no difference between the north and the south. Froissart\r\nstays at Orthez, in 1388, with Monseigneur Gaston Phebus de Foix; and at\r\nEltham, at the Court of Richard II. in 1394. In each case he uses\r\nexactly the same endeavours to please: both personages are men of the\r\nsame kind, having the same ideal in life, imbued with the same notions,\r\nand representing the same civilisation. He finds them both speaking\r\nFrench very well; Gaston \"talked to me, not in his own Gascon, but in\r\nfair and good French\"; Richard, too, \"full well spoke and read French.\"\r\nThe historian was duly recommended to each of them, but he relied\r\nespecially, to make himself welcome, on a present he had brought, the\r\nsame in both cases, a French manuscript containing amorous poems, which\r\nmanuscript \"the Comte de Foix saw full willingly; and every night, after\r\nhis supper, I read to him from it. But in reading none durst speak nor\r\nsay a word; for he wanted me to be well heard.\"\r\n\r\nHe takes the same precautions when he goes to England, where he had not\r\nbeen seen for a quarter of a century, and where he scarcely knew any one\r\nnow: \"And I had beforehand caused to be written, engrossed and\r\nilluminated and collected, all the amorous and moral treatises that, in\r\nthe lapse of thirty-four years, I had, by the grace of God and of Love,\r\nmade and compiled.\" He waits a favourable opportunity, and one day when\r\nthe councils on the affairs of State are ended, \"desired the king to see\r\nthe book that I had brought him. Then he saw it in his chamber, for all\r\nprepared I had it; I put it for him upon his bed. He opened it and\r\nlooked inside, and it pleased him greatly: and please him well it might,\r\nfor it was illuminated, written and ornamented and covered in scarlet\r\nvelvet, with ten silver nails gilded with gold, and golden roses in the\r\nmiddle, and with two great clasps gilded and richly worked in the middle\r\nwith golden roses.\r\n\r\n\"Then the king asked me of what it treated, and I told him: of Love.\r\n\r\n\"With this answer he was much rejoiced, and looked inside in several\r\nplaces, and read therein, for he spoke and read French full well; and\r\nthen had it taken by one of his knights, whom he called Sir Richard\r\nCredon, and carried into his withdrawing-room, and treated me better and\r\nbetter.\"[457]\r\n\r\nLong before this last journey of the illustrious chronicler, Chaucer was\r\nfamiliar with his poems, and he was acquainted, as most men around him\r\nwere, with those of his French contemporaries: Deguileville, Machault,\r\nDes Champs, and later Granson.[458] He sings like them of love, of\r\nspring, of the field-daisy[459]; he had read with passionate admiration\r\nthe poem, composed in the preceding century, which was most liked of\r\nall the literature of the time, the \"Roman de la Rose.\"\r\n\r\nThis famous poem was then at the height of a reputation which was to\r\nlast until after the Renaissance. The faults which deter us from it\r\ncontributed to its popularity as much as did its merits; digressions,\r\ndisquisitions, and sermons did not inspire the terror they do now;\r\ntwenty-three thousand lines of moralisation, psychological analysis,\r\nabstract dissertations, delivered by personified abstractions, did not\r\nweary the young imagination of the ancestors. The form is allegorical:\r\nthe rose is the maiden whom the lover desires to conquer: this form,\r\nwhich fell later into disfavour, delighted the readers of the fourteenth\r\ncentury for whom it was an additional pleasure to unriddle these easy\r\nenigmas.\r\n\r\nThe Church had helped to bring allegories into vogue; commentators had\r\nearly explained the New Testament by the Old, one being an allegory of\r\nthe other: the adventure of Jonah and the whale was an allegory of the\r\nresurrection; the Bestiaries were series of allegories; the litanies of\r\nthe Virgin lists of symbols. The methods of pious authors were adopted\r\nby worldly ones; Love had his religion, his allegories, his litanies,\r\nnot to speak of his paradise, his hell, and his ten commandments. He had\r\na whole celestial court of personified abstractions, composed of those\r\ntenuous and transparent beings who welcome or repel the lover in the\r\ngarden of the Rose. It was a new religion, this worship of woman,\r\nunknown to the ancients; Ovid no longer sufficed, imitators could not\r\nhelp altering his aim and ideal; the new cult required a gospel; that\r\ngospel was the \"Roman de la Rose.\"[460]\r\n\r\nThe discrepancies in the book did not shock the generality of readers;\r\nart at that time was full of contrasts, and life of contradictions, and\r\nthe thing was so usual that it went unnoticed. Saints prayed on the\r\nthreshold of churches, and gargoyles laughed at the saints. Guillaume de\r\nLorris built the porch of his cathedral of Love, and placed in the\r\nniches tall, long figures of pure and noble mien. Jean de Meun, forty\r\nyears later, continued the edifice, and was not sparing of gargoyles,\r\nmocking, grotesque, and indecent. Thence followed interminable\r\ndiscussions, some holding for Guillaume, others for Jean, some rejecting\r\nthe whole romance, others, the most numerous, accepting it all. These\r\ndissensions added still more to the fame of the work, and it was so\r\npopular that there exist more than two hundred manuscripts of it.[461]\r\nThe wise biographer of the wise king Charles V., Christina of Pisan,\r\nprotested in the name of insulted women: \"To you who have beautiful\r\ndaughters, and desire well to introduce them to honest life, give to\r\nthem, give the Romaunt of the Rose, to learn how to discern good from\r\nevil; what do I say, but evil from good! And of what utility, nor what\r\ndoes it profit listeners to hear such horrible things?\" The author\r\n\"never had acquaintance nor association with an honourable or virtuous\r\nwoman\"; he has known none save those of \"dissolute and evil life,\" and\r\nhas taken all the others to be according to that pattern.[462] The\r\nillustrious Gerson, in the fifteenth century, did the romance the honour\r\nof refuting it by a treatise according to rule; but the poem was none\r\nthe less translated into Latin, Flemish, and English, printed a number\r\nof times at the Renaissance and rejuvenated and edited by Marot.\r\n\r\nThere were several English translations, and one of them was the work of\r\nour young \"Valettus camerae regis.\" This translation by Chaucer is\r\nlost,[463] but we are aware not only that it existed, but even that it\r\nwas celebrated; its merit was known in France, and Des Champs, in\r\nsending his works to Chaucer,[464] congratulates him, above all things,\r\non having \"planted the rose-tree\" in \"the isle of giants,\" the \"angelic\r\nland,\" \"Angleterre,\" and on being there the god of worldly loves:\r\n\r\n    Tu es d'amours mondains dieux on Albie\r\n    Et de la Rose en la terre Angelique ...\r\n    En bon angles le livre translatas.\r\n\r\nThis authority in matters of love which Des Champs ascribes to his\r\nEnglish brother-author, is real. Chaucer composed then a quantity of\r\namorous poems, in the French style, for himself, for others, to while\r\naway the time, to allay his sorrows. Of them said Gower:\r\n\r\n    The lande fulfylled is over all.\r\n\r\nMost of them are lost; but we know, from contemporaneous allusions, that\r\nthey swarmed, and from himself that he wrote \"many an ympne\" to the God\r\nof love, \"balades, roundels, virelayes,\"\r\n\r\n           bokes, songes, dytees,\r\n    In ryme, or elles in cadence,\r\n\r\neach and all \"in reverence of Love.\"[465] A few poems, however, of that\r\nearly period, have reached us. They are, amongst others, his \"Compleynte\r\nunto Pite\"--\r\n\r\n    Pite, that I have sought so yore ago\r\n    With herte sore, and ful of besy peyne ...\r\n\r\n--a rough sketch of a subject that Sidney was to take up later and bring\r\nto perfection, and his \"Book of the Duchesse,\" composed on the occasion\r\nof the death of Blanche of Lancaster, wife of John of Gaunt.\r\n\r\nThe occasion is sad, but the setting is exquisite, for Chaucer wishes to\r\nraise to the Duchess who has disappeared a lasting monument, that shall\r\nprolong her memory, an elegant one, graceful as herself, where her\r\nportrait, traced by a friendly hand, shall recall the charms of a beauty\r\nthat each morning renewed. So lovable was she, and so full of\r\naccomplishment,\r\n\r\n    That she was lyk to torche bright,\r\n    That every man may take of light\r\n    Ynogh, and hit hath never the lesse.[466]\r\n\r\nAlready the descriptions have a freshness that no contemporaries equal,\r\nand show a care for truth and a gift of observation not often found in\r\nthe innumerable poems in dream-form left to us by the writers of the\r\nfourteenth century.\r\n\r\nTormented by his thoughts and deprived of sleep, the poet has a book\r\nbrought to him to while away the hours of night, one of those books that\r\nhe loved all his life, where \"clerkes hadde in olde tyme\" rhymed stories\r\nof long ago. The tale, \"a wonder thing\" though it was, puts him to\r\nsleep, and it seems to him that it is morning. The sun rises in a pure\r\nsky; the birds sing on the tiled roof, the light floods the room, which\r\nis all painted according to the taste of the Plantagenets. On the walls\r\nis represented \"al the Romaunce of the Rose\"; the window-glass offers to\r\nview the history of Troy; coloured rays fall on the bed; outside,\r\n\r\n               the welken was so fair,\r\n    Blew, bright, clere was the air ...\r\n    Ne in al the welken was a cloude.\r\n\r\nA hunt goes by, 'tis the hunt of the Emperor Octavian; the young man\r\nmounts and rides after it under those great trees, \"so huge of\r\nstrengthe, so ful of leves,\" beloved of the English, amid meadows thick\r\nstudded with flowers,\r\n\r\n    As thogh the erthe envye wolde\r\n    To be gayer than the heven.\r\n\r\nA little dog draws near; his movements are observed and noted with an\r\naccuracy that the Landseers of to-day could scarcely excel. The dog\r\nwould like to be well received, and afraid of being beaten, he creeps up\r\nand darts suddenly away:\r\n\r\n    Hit com and creep to me as lowe,\r\n    Right as hit hadde me y-knowe,\r\n    Hild doun his heed and joyned his eres,\r\n    And leyde al smothe down his heres.\r\n    I wolde han caught hit, and anoon\r\n    Hit fledde and was fro me goon.\r\n\r\nIn a glade apart was a knight clothed in black, John of Lancaster.\r\nChaucer does not endeavour to console him; he knows the only assuagement\r\nfor such sorrows, and leads him on to speak of the dead. John recalls\r\nher grace and gentleness, and praises qualities which carry us back to a\r\ntime very far from our own. She was not one of those women who, to try\r\ntheir lovers, send them to Wallachia, Prussia, Tartary, Egypt, or\r\nTurkey:\r\n\r\n    She ne used no suche knakkes smale.[467]\r\n\r\nFrom these \"knakkes smale\" we may judge what the others must have been.\r\nThey discourse thus a long while; the clock strikes noon, and the poet\r\nawakes, his head on the book which had put him to sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1370 Chaucer left London and repaired to the Continent\r\nfor the service of the king; this was the first of his diplomatic\r\nmissions, which succeeded each other rapidly during the ensuing ten\r\nyears. The period of the Middle Ages was not a period of _nuances_; that\r\n_nuance_ which distinguishes an ambassador from a messenger was held as\r\ninsignificant, and escaped observation; the two functions formed but\r\none. \"You,\" said Eustache Des Champs, \"you, ambassador and messenger,\r\nwho go about the world to do your duty at the Courts of great princes,\r\nyour journeys are not short ones!... Don't be in such a hurry; your plea\r\nmust be submitted to council before an answer can be returned: just wait\r\na little more, my good friend; ... we must talk of the matter with the\r\nchancellor and some others.... Time passes and all turns out\r\nwrong.\"[468] Precedents are a great thing in diplomacy; here we find a\r\ntime-honoured one.\r\n\r\nRecourse was often had to men of letters, for these mixed functions, and\r\nthey were filled by the most illustrious writers of the century,\r\nBoccaccio in Italy, Chaucer in England, Des Champs in France. The\r\nlatter, whose career much resembles Chaucer's, has traced the most\r\nlamentable pictures of the life led by an \"ambassador and messenger\" on\r\nthe highways of Europe: Bohemia, Poland, Hungary; in these regions the\r\nking's service caused him to journey. His horse is half dead, and \"sits\r\non his knees\"[469]; the inhabitants have the incivility to speak only\r\ntheir own language, so that one cannot even order one's dinner; you must\r\nneeds take what is served: \"'Tis ill eating to another's appetite.\"[470]\r\n\r\nThe lodging is worse: \"No one may lie by himself, but two by two in a\r\ndark room, or oftener three by three, in one bed, haphazard.\" One may\r\nwell regret sweet France, \"where each one has for his money what he\r\nchooses to ask for, and at reasonable price: room to himself, fire,\r\nsleep, repose, bed, white pillow, and scented sheets.\"[471]\r\n\r\nHappily for Chaucer, it was in Flanders, France, and Italy that he\r\nnegotiated for Edward and Richard. In December, 1372, he traverses all\r\nFrance, and goes to Genoa to treat with the doge of commercial matters;\r\nthen he repairs to Florence, and having thus passed a whole winter far\r\nfrom the London fogs (which already existed in the Middle Ages), he\r\nreturns to England in the summer of 1373. In 1376 a new mission is\r\nentrusted to him, this time a secret one, the secret has been well kept\r\nto this day; more missions in 1377 and 1378. \"On Trinity Sunday,\" 1376,\r\nsays Froissart, \"passed away from this world the flower of England's\r\nchivalry, my lord Edward of England, Prince of Wales and Aquitaine, in\r\nthe palace of Westminster by London, and was embalmed and put into a\r\nleaden chest.\" After the obsequies, \"the king of England made his\r\nchildren recognise ... the young _damoisel_ Richard to be king after his\r\ndeath.\" He sends delegates to Bruges to treat of the marriage of his\r\nheir, aged ten, with \"Madame Marie, daughter of the king of France\"; in\r\nFebruary other ambassadors are appointed on both sides: \"Towards Lent, a\r\nsecret treaty was made between the two kings for their party to be at\r\nMontreuil-on-sea. Thus were sent to Calais, by the English, Messire\r\nGuichard d'Angle, Richard Stury, and Geoffrey Chaucer.\"[472] The\r\nnegotiation failed, but the poet's services seem nevertheless to have\r\nbeen appreciated, for in the following year he is again on the highways.\r\nHe negotiates in France, in company with the same Sir Guichard, now\r\nbecome earl of Huntingdon; and again in Italy, where he has to treat\r\nwith his compatriot Hawkwood,[473] who led, in the most agreeable\r\nmanner possible, the life of a condottiere for the benefit of the Pope,\r\nand of any republic that paid him well.\r\n\r\nThese journeys to Italy had a considerable influence on Chaucer's mind.\r\nAlready in that privileged land the Renaissance was beginning. Italy\r\nhad, in that century, three of her greatest poets: the one whom Virgil\r\nhad conducted to the abode of \"the doomed race\" was dead; but the other\r\ntwo, Petrarch and Boccaccio, still lived, secluded, in the abode which\r\nwas to be their last on earth, one at Arqua, near Padua, the other in\r\nthe little fortified village of Certaldo, near Florence.\r\n\r\nIn art, it is the century of Giotto, Orcagna, and Andrew of Pisa.\r\nChaucer saw, all fresh still in their glowing colours, frescoes that\r\ntime has long faded. Those old things were then young, and what seems to\r\nus the first steps of an art, uncertain yet in its tread, seemed to\r\ncontemporaries the supreme effort of the audacious, who represented the\r\nnew times.\r\n\r\nChaucer's own testimony is proof to us that he saw, heard, and learnt as\r\nmuch as possible; that he went as far as he could, letting himself be\r\nguided by \"adventure, that is the moder of tydinges.\" He arrived without\r\nany preconceived ideas, curious to know what occupied men's minds, as\r\nattentive as on the threshold of his \"Hous of Fame\":\r\n\r\n    For certeynly, he that me made\r\n    To comen hider, seyde me,\r\n    I shulde bothe here et see,\r\n    In this place wonder thinges ...\r\n    For yit peraventure, I may lere\r\n    Some good ther-on, or sumwhat here,\r\n    That leef me were, or that I wente.[474]\r\n\r\nHe was thus able to see with his own eyes the admirable activity, owing\r\nto which rose throughout Italy monuments wherein all kinds of\r\ncontradictory aspirations mingled, and which are nevertheless so\r\nharmonious in their _ensemble_, monuments of which Giotto's campanile is\r\nthe type, wherein we still recognise the Middle Ages, even while we\r\nforesee the Renaissance--with Gothic windows and a general aspect which\r\nis classic, where the sentiment of realism and everyday life is combined\r\nwith veneration for antique art, where Apelles is represented painting a\r\ntriptych of Gothic shape. Pisa had already, at that day, its leaning\r\ntower, its cathedral, its baptistery, the exterior ornamentation of\r\nwhich had just been changed, its Campo Santo, the paintings of which\r\nwere not finished, and were not yet attributed to Orcagna. Along the\r\nwalls of the cemetery he could examine that first collection of antiques\r\nwhich inspired the Tuscan artists, the sarcophagus, with the story of\r\nPhaedra and Hippolytus, which Nicholas of Pisa took for his model. He\r\ncould see at Pistoja the pulpit carved by William of Pisa, with the\r\nmagnificent nude torso of a woman, imitated from the antique. At\r\nFlorence the Palazzo Vecchio, which was not yet called thus, was\r\nfinished; so were the Bargello, Santa-Croce, Santa-Maria-Novella.\r\nOr-San-Michele was being built; the Loggia of the Lansquenets was\r\nscarcely begun; the baptistery had as yet only one of its famous doors\r\nof bronze; the cathedral disappeared under scaffoldings; the workmen\r\nwere busy with the nave and the apse. Giotto's campanile had been\r\nfinished by his pupil Gaddi, the Ponte Vecchio, which did not deserve\r\nthat name any better than the palace, had been rebuilt by the same\r\nGaddi, and along the causeway which continued it, through clusters of\r\ncypress and olive trees, the road led up to San Miniato, all resplendent\r\nwith its marbles, its mosaics, and its paintings. On other ranges of\r\nhills, amid more cypress and more olive trees, by the side of Roman\r\nruins, arose the church of Fiesole, and half-way to Florence waved in\r\nthe sunlight the thick foliage overshadowing the villa which, during the\r\ngreat plague had sheltered the young men and the ladies of the\r\n\"Decameron.\"\r\n\r\nThe movement was a general one. Each town strove to emulate its\r\nneighbour, not only on the battlefields, which were a very frequent\r\ntrysting-place, but in artistic progress; paintings, mosaics, carvings,\r\nshone in all the palaces and churches of every city; the activity was\r\nextreme. Giotto, who had his studio, his \"botega,\" in Florence, worked\r\nalso at Assisi, Rome, and Padua. Sienna was covering the walls of her\r\npublic palace with frescoes, some figures of which resemble the\r\npaintings at Pompeii.[475] An antique statue found within her territory\r\nwas provoking universal admiration, and was erected on the Gaia fountain\r\nby the municipality; but the Middle Ages did not lose their rights, and,\r\nthe republic having suffered reverses, the statue fell into disgrace.\r\nThe god became nothing more than an idol; the marble was shattered and\r\ncarried off, to be treacherously interred in the territory of\r\nFlorence.[476]\r\n\r\nThe taste for collections was spreading; the commerce of antiquities\r\nflourished in Northern Italy. Petrarch bought medals, and numbered among\r\nhis artistic treasures a Madonna of Giotto, \"whose beauty,\" he says in\r\nhis will, \"escaped the ignorant and enraptured the masters of the\r\nart.\"[477] This brightening of the land was the result of concurring\r\nwills, nor did it pass unobserved even then; towns enjoyed their\r\nmasterpieces, and, like young women, \"se miraient en leur beaute.\"\r\nContemporaries did not leave to posterity the care of crowning the\r\ngreat poets of the time. Italy, the mother of art, wished the laurel to\r\nencircle the brow of the living, not to be simply the ornament of a\r\ntomb. Rome had crowned, in 1341, him who, \"cleansing the fount of\r\nHelicon from slime and marshy rushes, had restored to the water its\r\npristine limpidity, who had opened Castalia's grotto, obstructed by a\r\nnetwork of wild boughs, and destroyed the briers in the laurel grove\":\r\nthe illustrious Francis Petrarch.[478] Though somewhat tardy, the honour\r\nwas no less great for Dante: public lectures on the \"Divine Comedy\" were\r\ninstituted in Florence, and the lecturer was Boccaccio.[479]\r\n\r\nIt was impossible that a mind, from infancy friendly to art and books,\r\nshould not be struck by this general expansion; the charm of this\r\nliterary springtime was too penetrating for Chaucer not to feel it; he\r\nfollowed a movement so conformable to his tastes, and we have a proof of\r\nit. Before his journeys he was ignorant of Italian literature; now he\r\nknows Italian, and has read the great classic authors of the Tuscan\r\nland: Boccaccio, Petrarch, and Dante. The remembrance of their works\r\nhaunts him; the \"Roman de la Rose\" ceases to be his main literary ideal.\r\nHe was acquainted with the old classics before his missions; but the\r\ntone in which he speaks of them now has changed; to-day it is a tone of\r\nveneration; one should kiss their \"steppes.\" He expresses himself about\r\nthem as Petrarch did; it seems, so great is the resemblance, as if we\r\nfound in his verses an echo of the conversations they very likely had\r\ntogether by Padua in 1373.[480]\r\n\r\nIn the intervals between his missions Chaucer would return to London,\r\nwhere administrative functions had been entrusted to him. For twelve\r\nyears, dating from 1374, he was comptroller of the customs, and during\r\nthe ten first years he was obliged, according to his oath, to write the\r\naccounts and to draw up the rolls of the receipts with his own hand: \"Ye\r\nshall swere that ... ye shall write the rolles by your owne hande\r\ndemesned.\"[481] To have an idea of the work this implies, one should\r\nsee, at the Record Office, the immense sheets of parchment fastened\r\ntogether, one after the other, which constitute these rolls.[482] After\r\nhaving himself been present at the weighing and verifying of the\r\nmerchandise, Chaucer entered the name of the owner, the quality and\r\nquantity of the produce taxed, and the amount to be collected: endless\r\n\"rekeninges!\" Defrauders were fined; one, John Kent, of London, having\r\ntried to smuggle some wools to Dordrecht, the poet, poet though he was,\r\ndiscovered the offence; the wools were confiscated and sold, and Chaucer\r\nreceived seventy-one pounds four shillings and sixpence on the amount of\r\nthe fine John Kent had to pay.\r\n\r\nChaucer lived now in one of the towers under which opened the gates of\r\nLondon. The municipality had granted him lodgings in the Aldgate\r\ntower[483]; his friend the philosopher and logician, Ralph Strode, lived\r\nin the same way in rooms above \"Aldrichgate\"[484]; both were to quit the\r\nplace at any moment if the defence of the town rendered it necessary.\r\nChaucer lived there twelve years, from 1374 to 1386. There, his labour\r\nended, he would come home and begin his _other life_, his poet's life,\r\nreading, thinking, remembering. Then all he had known in Italy would\r\nreturn to his memory, campaniles, azure frescoes, olive groves, sonnets\r\nof Petrarch, poems of Dante, tales of Boccaccio; he had brought back\r\nwherewithal to move and to enliven \"merry England\" herself. Once more in\r\nhis tower, whither he returned without speaking to any one, \"domb,\" he\r\nsays, \"as any stoon,\" the everyday world was done with; his neighbours\r\nwere to him as though they had lived at the ends of earth[485]; his real\r\nneighbours were Dante and Virgil.\r\n\r\nHe wrote during this period, and chiefly in his tower of Aldgate, the\r\n\"Lyf of Seinte Cecile,\" 1373; the \"Compleynt of Mars,\" 1380; a\r\ntranslation of Boethius in prose; the \"Parlement of Foules;\" \"Troilus\r\nand Criseyde,\" 1382; the \"Hous of Fame,\" 1383-4; the \"Legend of Good\r\nWomen,\" 1385.[486] In all these works the ideal is principally an\r\nItalian and Latin one; but, at the same time, we see some beginning of\r\nthe Chaucer of the last period, who, having moved round the world of\r\nletters, will cease to look abroad, and, after the manner of his own\r\nnation, dropping in a large measure foreign elements, will show himself\r\nabove all and mainly an Englishman.\r\n\r\nAt this time, however, he is as yet under the charm of Southern art and\r\nof ancient models; he does not weary of invoking and depicting the gods\r\nof Olympus. Nudity, which the image-makers of cathedrals had inflicted\r\nas a chastisement on the damned, scandalises him no more than it did the\r\npainters of Italy. He sees Venus, \"untressed,\" reclining on her couch,\r\n\"a bed of golde,\" clothed in transparent draperies,\r\n\r\n    Right with a subtil kerchef of Valence,\r\n    Ther was no thikker cloth of no defence;\r\n\r\nor with less draperies still:\r\n\r\n    I saw Beautee withouten any atyr[487];\r\n\r\nor again:\r\n\r\n    Naked fleting in a see;\r\n\r\nher brows circled with a \"rose-garlond white and reed.\"[488] He calls\r\nher to his aid:\r\n\r\n    Now faire blisful, O Cipris,\r\n    So be my favour at this tyme!\r\n    And ye, me to endyte and ryme\r\n    Helpeth, that on Parnaso dwelle\r\n    By Elicon the clere welle.[489]\r\n\r\nHis \"Compleynt of Anelida\" is dedicated to\r\n\r\n    Thou ferse god of armes, Mars the rede,\r\n\r\nand to Polymnia:\r\n\r\n    Be favourable eek, thou Polymnia,\r\n    On Parnaso that, with thy sustres glade,\r\n    By Elicon, not fer from Cirrea,\r\n    Singest with vois memorial in the shade,\r\n    Under the laurer which that may not fade.[490]\r\n\r\nOld books of antiquity possess for him, as they did for the learned men\r\nof the Renaissance, or for Petrarch, who cherished a manuscript of Homer\r\nwithout being able to decipher it, a character almost divine:\r\n\r\n    For out of olde feldes, as men seith,\r\n    Cometh al this newe corn fro yeer to yere;\r\n    And out of olde bokes, in good feith,\r\n    Cometh al this newe science that men lere.[491]\r\n\r\nPoggio or Poliziano could not have spoken in more feeling words.\r\n\r\n    Glory and honour, Virgil Mantuan,\r\n    Be to thy name![492]\r\n\r\nexclaims he elsewhere. \"Go, my book,\" he says to his \"Troilus and\r\nCriseyde,\"\r\n\r\n    And kis the steppes, wher-as thou seest pace\r\n    Virgile, Ovyde, Omer, Lucan, Stace.[493]\r\n\r\nWithal strange discrepancies occur: none can escape entirely the\r\ninfluence of his own time. With Chaucer the goddess of love is also a\r\nsaint, \"Seint Venus\"; her temple is likewise a church: \"This noble\r\ntemple ... this chirche.\" Before penetrating into its precincts, the\r\npoet appeals to Christ:\r\n\r\n    \"O Crist,\" thought I, \"that art in blisse,\r\n    Fro fantom and illusioun\r\n    Me save!\" and with devocioun\r\n    Myn yen to the heven I caste.[494]\r\n\r\nThis medley was inevitable; to do better would have been to excel the\r\nItalians, and Dante himself, who places the Erinnyes within the circles\r\nof his Christian hell, or Giotto, who made Apelles paint a triptych.\r\n\r\nAs for the Italians, Chaucer borrows from them, sometimes a line, an\r\nidea, a comparison, sometimes long passages very closely translated, or\r\nagain the plot or the general inspiration of his tales. In the \"Lyf of\r\nSeinte Cecile\" a passage (lines 36-51) is borrowed from Dante's\r\n\"Paradiso.\" The same poet is quoted in the \"Parlement of Foules,\" where\r\nwe find a paraphrase of the famous \"Per me si va\"[495]; another passage\r\nis imitated from the \"Teseide\" of Boccaccio; \"Anelida and Arcite\"\r\ncontains several stanzas taken from the same original; \"Troilus and\r\nCriseyde\" is an adaptation of Boccaccio's \"Filostrato\"; Chaucer\r\nintroduces into it a sonnet of Petrarch[496]; the idea of the \"Legend of\r\nGood Women\" is borrowed from the \"De claris Mulieribus\" of Boccaccio.\r\nDante's journeys to the spirit-world served as models for the \"Hous of\r\nFame,\" where the English poet is borne off by an eagle of golden hue.\r\nIn it Dante is mentioned together with the classic authors of antiquity.\r\nRead:\r\n\r\n    On Virgil, or on Claudian,\r\n    Or Daunte.[497]\r\n\r\nThe eagle is not an invention of Chaucer's; it had already appeared in\r\nthe \"Purgatorio.\"[498]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the quantity of reminiscences of ancient or Italian\r\nauthors that recur at every page; notwithstanding the story of AEneas\r\nrelated wholly from Virgil, the first lines being translated word for\r\nword[499]; notwithstanding incessant allusions and quotations, the \"Hous\r\nof Fame\"[500] is one of the first poems in which Chaucer shows forth\r\nclearly his own personality. Already we see manifested that gift for\r\nfamiliar dialogue which is carried so far in \"Troilus and Criseyde,\" and\r\nalready appears that sound and kindly judgment with which the poet will\r\nview the things of life in his \"Canterbury Tales.\" Evil does not prevent\r\nhis seeing good; the sadness he has known does not make him rebel\r\nagainst fate; he has suffered and forgiven; joys dwell in his memory\r\nrather than sorrows; despite his moments of melancholy, his turn of mind\r\nmakes him an optimist at heart, an optimist like La Fontaine and\r\nAddison, whose names often recur to the memory in reading Chaucer. His\r\nphilosophy resembles the \"bon-homme\" La Fontaine's; and several passages\r\nin the \"Hous of Fame\" are like some of Addison's essays.[501]\r\n\r\nHe is modern, too, in the part he allots to his own self, a self which,\r\nfar from being odious (\"le moi est haissable,\" Pascal said), is, on the\r\ncontrary, charming; he relates the long vigils in his tower, where he\r\nspends his nights in writing, or at other times seated before a book,\r\nwhich he reads until his eyes are dim in his \"hermyte's\" solitude.\r\n\r\nThe eagle, come from heaven to be his guide, bears him off where his\r\nfancy had already flown, above the clouds, beyond the spheres, to the\r\ntemple of Fame, built upon an ice mountain. Illustrious names graven in\r\nthe sparkling rock melt in the sun, and are already almost illegible.\r\nThe temple itself is built in the Gothic style of the period, all\r\nbristling with \"niches, pinnacles, and statues,\" and\r\n\r\n    ... ful eek of windowes\r\n    As flakes falle in grete snowes.[502]\r\n\r\nThere are those rustling crowds in which Chaucer loved to mix at times,\r\nwhose murmurs soothed his thoughts, musicians, harpists, jugglers,\r\nminstrels, tellers of tales full \"of weping and of game,\" magicians,\r\nsorcerers and prophets, curious specimens of humanity. Within the\r\ntemple, the statues of his literary gods, who sang of the Trojan war:\r\nHomer, Dares, and also the Englishman Geoffrey of Monmouth, \"English\r\nGaufride,\" and with them, Virgil, Ovid, Lucan, Claudian, and Statius. At\r\nthe command of Fame, the names of the heroes are borne by the wind to\r\nthe four corners of the world; a burst of music celebrates the deeds of\r\nthe warriors:\r\n\r\n    For in fight and blood-shedinge\r\n    Is used gladly clarioninge.[503]\r\n\r\nVarious companies flock to obtain glory; the poet does not forget the\r\ngroup, already formed in his day, of the braggarts who boast of their\r\nvices:\r\n\r\n    We ben shrewes, every wight,\r\n    And han delyt in wikkednes,\r\n    As gode folk han in goodnes;\r\n    And joye to be knowen shrewes ...\r\n    Wherfor we preyen yow, a-rowe,\r\n    That our fame swich be-knowe\r\n    In alle thing right as it is.[504]\r\n\r\nAs pressing as any, they urgently claim a bad reputation, a favour which\r\nthe goddess graciously grants them.\r\n\r\nElsewhere we are transported into the house of news, noisy and surging\r\nas the public square of an Italian city on a day when \"something\" has\r\nhappened. People throng, and crush, and trample each other to see,\r\nalthough there is nothing to see: Chaucer describes from nature. There\r\nare assembled numbers of messengers, travellers, pilgrims, sailors, each\r\nbearing his bag, full of news, full of lies:\r\n\r\n                       \"Nost not thou\r\n    That is betid, lo, late or now?\"\r\n    --\"No,\" quod the other, \"tel me what.\"\r\n    And than he tolde him this and that,\r\n    And swoor ther-to that hit was sooth--\r\n    \"Thus hath he seyd\"--and \"thus he dooth\"--\r\n    \"Thus shal hit be\"--\"Thus herde I seye\"--\r\n    \"That shal be found\"--\"That dar I leye.\"[505]\r\n\r\nTruth and falsehood, closely united, form an inseparable body, and fly\r\naway together. The least little nothing, whispered in secret in a\r\nfriend's ear, grows and grows, as in La Fontaine's fable:\r\n\r\n    As fyr is wont to quikke and go,\r\n    From a sparke spronge amis,\r\n    Til al a citee brent up is.[506]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nHeretofore Chaucer has composed poems of brightest hue, chiefly devoted\r\nto love, \"balades, roundels, virelayes,\" imitations of the \"Roman de la\r\nRose,\" poems inspired by antiquity, as it appeared through the prism of\r\nthe Middle Ages. His writings are superior to those of his English or\r\nFrench contemporaries, but they are of like kind; he has fine passages,\r\ncharming ideas, but no well-ordered work; his colours are fresh but\r\ncrude, like the colours of illuminations, blazons, or oriflammes; his\r\nnights are of sable, and his meadows seem of sinople, his flowers are\r\n\"whyte, blewe, yelowe, and rede.\"[507] In \"Troilus and Criseyde\" we\r\nfind another Chaucer, far more complete and powerful; he surpasses now\r\neven the Italians whom he had taken for his models, and writes the first\r\ngreat poem of renewed English literature.\r\n\r\nThe fortunes of Troilus had grown little by little in the course of\r\ncenturies. Homer merely mentions his name; Virgil devotes three lines to\r\nhim; Dares, who has seen everything, draws his portrait; Benoit de\r\nSainte-More is the earliest to ascribe to him a love first happy, then\r\ntragic; Gui de Colonna intermingles sententious remarks with the\r\nnarrative; Boccaccio develops the story, adds characters, and makes of\r\nit a romance, an elegant tale in which young Italian noblemen, equally\r\nhandsome, youthful, amorous, and unscrupulous, win ladies' hearts, lose\r\nthem, and discourse subtly about their desires and their mishaps.[508]\r\n\r\nChaucer appropriates the plot,[509] transforms the personages, alters\r\nthe tone of the narrative, breaks the monotony of it, introduces\r\ndifferences of age and disposition, and moulds in his own way the\r\nmaterial that he borrows, like a man now sure of himself, who dares to\r\njudge and to criticise; who thinks it possible to improve upon a romance\r\neven of Boccaccio's. The literary progress marked by this work is\r\nastonishing, not more so, however, than the progress accomplished in\r\nthe same time by the nation. With the Parliament of Westminster as with\r\nChaucer's poetry, the real definitive England is beginning.\r\n\r\nIn Chaucer, indeed, as in the new race, the mingling of the origins has\r\nbecome intimate and indissoluble. In \"Troilus and Criseyde\" the Celt's\r\nready wit, gift of repartee, and sense of the dramatic; the care for the\r\nform and ordering of a narrative, dear to the Latin races; the Norman's\r\nfaculty of observation, are allied to the emotion and tenderness of the\r\nSaxon. This fusion had been brought about slowly, when however the time\r\ncame, its realisation was complete all at once, almost sudden. Yesterday\r\nauthors of English tongue could only lisp; to-day, no longer content to\r\ntalk, they sing.\r\n\r\nIn its semi-epic form, the poem of \"Troilus and Criseyde\" is connected\r\nwith the art of the novel and the art of the drama, to the development\r\nof which England was to contribute so highly. It is already the English\r\nnovel and drama where the tragic and the comic are blended; where the\r\nheroic and the trivial go side by side, as in real life; where Juliet's\r\nnurse interrupts the lovers leaning over the balcony of the Capulets,\r\nwhere princesses have no confidants, diminished reproductions of their\r\nown selves, invented to give them their cue; where sentiments are\r\nexamined closely, with an attentive mind, friendly to experimental\r\npsychology; and where, nevertheless, far from holding always to subtile\r\ndissertations, all that is material fact is clearly exposed to view, in\r\na good light, and not merely talked about. The vital parts of the drama\r\nare all exhibited before our eyes and not concealed behind the scenes;\r\nheroes are not all spirit, neither are they mere images; we are as far\r\nfrom the crude illuminations of degenerate minstrels as from La\r\nCalprenede's heroic romances; the characters have muscles, bones and\r\nsinews, and at the same time, hearts and souls; they are real men. The\r\ndate of \"Troilus and Criseyde\" is a great date in English literature.\r\n\r\nThe book, like Froissart's collection of poems, treats \"of love.\" It\r\nrelates how Criseyde, or Cressida, the daughter of Calchas, left in Troy\r\nwhile her father returned to the Greek camp, loves the handsome knight\r\nTroilus, son of Priam. Given back to the Greeks, she forgets Troilus,\r\nwho is slain.\r\n\r\nHow came this young woman, as virtuous as she was beautiful, to love\r\nthis youth, whom at the opening of the story she did not even know? What\r\nexternal circumstances brought them together, and what workings of the\r\nheart made them pass from indifference to doubts and anxieties, and then\r\nto love? These two orders of thought are untwined simultaneously, on\r\nparallel lines by Chaucer, that dreamer who had lived so much in real\r\nlife, that man of action who had dreamed so many dreams.\r\n\r\nTroilus despised love, and mocked at lovers:\r\n\r\n    If knight or squyer of his companye\r\n    Gan for to syke, or lete his eyen bayten\r\n    On any woman that he coude aspye;\r\n    He wolde smyle, and holden it folye,\r\n    And seye him thus, \"God wot she slepeth softe\r\n    For love of thee, whan thou tornest ful ofte.\"[510]\r\n\r\nOne day, in the temple, he sees Cressida, and his fate is sealed; he\r\ncannot remove his gaze from her; the wind of love has swept by; all his\r\nstrength has vanished; his pride has fallen as the petals fall from a\r\nrose; he drinks deep draughts of an invincible poison. Far from her, his\r\nimagination completes what reality had begun: seated on the foot of his\r\nbed, absorbed in thought, he once more sees Cressida, and sees her so\r\nbeautiful, depicted in outlines so vivid, and colours so glowing, that\r\nthis divine image fashioned in his own brain is henceforth the only one\r\nhe will behold; forever will he have before his eyes that celestial form\r\nof superhuman beauty, never more the real earthly Cressida, the frail\r\ndaughter of Calchas. Troilus is ill for life of the love illness.\r\n\r\nHe has a friend, older than himself, sceptical, trivial, experienced,\r\n\"that called was Pandare,\" Cressida's uncle. He confides to him his\r\nwoes, and asks for help. Pandarus, in Boccaccio, is a young nobleman,\r\nsceptical too, but frivolous, disdainful, elegant, like a personage of\r\nMusset. Chaucer transforms the whole drama and makes room for the\r\ngrosser realities of life, by altering the character of Pandarus. He\r\nmakes of him a man of mature years devoid of scruples, talkative,\r\nshameless, wily, whose wisdom consists in proverbs chosen among the\r\neasiest to follow, much more closely connected with Moliere's or\r\nShakespeare's comic heroes than with Musset's lovers. Pandarus is as\r\nfond of comparisons as Gros-Rene, as fond of old saws as Polonius; he is\r\ncoarse and indecent, unintentionally and by nature, like Juliet's\r\nnurse.[511] He is totally unconscious, and thinks himself the best\r\nfriend in the world, and the most reserved; he concludes interminable\r\nspeeches by:\r\n\r\n    I jape nought, as ever have I joye.\r\n\r\nEvery one of his thoughts, of his words, of his attitudes is the very\r\nopposite of Cressida's and her lover's, and makes them stand out in\r\nrelief by a contrast of shade. He is all for tangible and present\r\nrealities, and does not believe in ever foregoing an immediate and\r\ncertain pleasure in consideration of merely possible consequences.\r\n\r\nWith this disposition, and in this frame of mind, he approaches his\r\nniece to speak to her of love. The scene, which is entirely of Chaucer's\r\ninvention, is a true comedy scene; the gestures and attitudes are\r\nminutely noted. Cressida looks down; Pandarus coughs. The dialogue is so\r\nrapid and sharp that one might think this part written for a play, not\r\nfor a tale in verse. The uncle arrives; the niece, seated with a book on\r\nher knees, was reading a romance.\r\n\r\nAh! you were reading! What book was it? \"What seith it? Tel it us. Is it\r\nof Love?\" It was of Thebes; \"this romaunce is of Thebes;\" she had\r\nsecured as it seems a very early copy. She excuses herself for indulging\r\nin so frivolous a pastime; she would perhaps do better to read \"on holy\r\nseyntes lyves.\" Chaucer, mindful above all of the analysis of passions,\r\ndoes not trouble himself about anachronisms; he cares nothing to know if\r\nthe besieged Trojans could really have drawn examples of virtue from the\r\nLives of the Saints; history matters little to him: let those who take\r\nan interest in it look \"in Omer or in Dares.\"[512] The motions of the\r\nhuman heart, that is his real subject, not the march of armies; from the\r\nmoment of its birth, the English novel is psychological.\r\n\r\nWith a thousand precautions, and although still keeping to the vulgarity\r\nof his role, Pandarus manages so as to bring to a sufficiently serious\r\nmood the laughter-loving Cressida; he contrives that she shall praise\r\nTroilus herself, incidentally, before he has even named him. With his\r\nfrivolities he mingles serious things, wise and practical advice like a\r\ngood uncle, the better to inspire confidence; then he rises to depart\r\nwithout having yet said what brought him. Cressida's interest is excited\r\nat once, the more so that reticence is not habitual to Pandarus; her\r\ncuriosity, irritated from line to line, becomes anxiety, almost anguish,\r\nfor though Cressida be of the fourteenth century, and the first of a\r\nlong line of heroines of romance, with her appears already the nervous\r\nwoman. She starts at the least thing, she is the most impressionable of\r\nbeings, \"the ferfullest wight that might be\"; even the state of the\r\natmosphere affects her. What is then the matter? Oh! only this:\r\n\r\n            ... the kinges dere sone,\r\n    The goode, wyse, worthy, fresshe, and free,\r\n    Which alwey for to do wel is his wone,\r\n    The noble Troilus, so loveth thee,\r\n    That, bot ye helpe, it wol his bane be.\r\n    Lo, here is al, what sholde I more seye?\r\n    Do what yow list.[513]\r\n\r\nThe conversation continues, more and more crafty on the part of\r\nPandarus; his friend asks for so little: look less unkindly upon him,\r\nand it will be enough.\r\n\r\nBut here appears Chaucer's art in all its subtilty. The wiles of\r\nPandarus, carried as far as his character will allow, might have\r\nsufficed to make a Cressida of romance yield; but it would have been too\r\neasy play for the master already sure of his powers. He makes Pandarus\r\nsay a word too much; Cressida unmasks him on the spot, obliges him to\r\nacknowledge that in asking less he desired more for his friend, and now\r\nshe is blushing and indignant. Chaucer does not want her to yield to\r\ndisquisitions and descriptions; all the cleverness of Pandarus is there\r\nonly to make us better appreciate the slow inward working that is going\r\non in Cressida's heart; her uncle will have sufficed to stir her; that\r\nis all, and, truth to say, that is something. She feels for Troilus no\r\nclearly defined sentiment, but her curiosity is aroused. And just then,\r\nwhile the conversation is still going on, loud shouts are heard, the\r\ncrowd rushes, balconies are filled, strains of music burst forth; 'tis\r\nthe return, after a victorious sally, of one of the heroes who defend\r\nTroy. This hero is Troilus, and in the midst of this triumphal scene,\r\nthe pretty, frail, laughing, tender-hearted Cressida beholds for the\r\nfirst time her royal lover.\r\n\r\nIn her turn she dreams, she meditates, she argues. She is not yet, like\r\nTroilus, love's prisoner; Chaucer does not proceed so fast. She keeps\r\nher vision lucid; her imagination and her senses have not yet done their\r\nwork and reared before her that glittering phantom, ever present, which\r\nconceals reality from lovers. She is still mistress of herself enough to\r\ndiscern motives and objections; she discusses and reviews elevated\r\nreasons, low reasons, and even some of those practical reasons which\r\nwill be instantly dismissed, but not without having produced their\r\neffect. Let us not make an enemy of this king's son. Besides, can I\r\nprevent his loving me? His love has nothing unflattering; is he not the\r\nfirst knight of Troy after Hector? What is there astonishing in his\r\npassion for me? If he loves me, shall I be the only one to be loved in\r\nTroy? Scarcely, for\r\n\r\n    Men loven wommen al this toun aboute.\r\n    Be they the wers? Why, nay, withouten doute.\r\n\r\nAm I not pretty? \"I am oon of the fayrest\" in all \"the toun of Troye,\"\r\nthough I should not like people to know that I know it:\r\n\r\n    Al wolde I that noon wiste of this thought.\r\n\r\nAfter all I am free; \"I am myn owene woman\"; no husband to say to me\r\n\"chekmat!\" And \"_par dieux!_ I am nought religious!\" I am not a nun.\r\n\r\n    But right as whan the sonne shyneth brighte\r\n    In March that chaungeth ofte tyme his face\r\n    And that a cloud is put with wind to flighte\r\n    Which over-sprat the sonne as for a space,\r\n    A cloudy thought gan thorugh hir soule pace,\r\n    That over-spradde hir brighte thoughtes alle.[514]\r\n\r\nNow she unfolds contradictory arguments supported by considerations\r\nequally decisive; she is suffering from that _diboulia_ (alternate will)\r\nfamiliar to lovers who are not yet thoroughly in love. There are two\r\nCressidas in her; the dialogue begun with Pandarus is continued in her\r\nheart; the scene of comedy is renewed there in a graver key.\r\n\r\nHer decision is not taken; when will it be? At what precise moment does\r\nlove begin? One scarcely knows; when it has come one fixes the date in\r\nthe past by hypothesis. We say: it was that day, but when that day was\r\nthe present day, we said nothing, and knew nothing; a sort of \"perhaps\"\r\nfilled the soul, delightful, but still only a perhaps. Cressida is in\r\nthat obscure period, and the workings within her are shown by the\r\nimpression which the incidents of daily life produce upon her mind. It\r\nseems to her that everything speaks of love, and that fate is in league\r\nagainst her with Pandarus and Troilus: it is but an appearance, the\r\neffect of her own imagination, and produced by her state of mind; in\r\nreality it happens simply that now the little incidents of life impress\r\nher more when they relate to love; the others pass so unperceived that\r\nlove alone has a place. She might have felt anxious about herself if she\r\nhad discerned this difference between then and now; but the blindness\r\nhas commenced, she does not observe that the things appertaining to love\r\nfind easy access to her heart, and that, where one enters so easily, it\r\nis usually that the door is open. She paces in her melancholy mood the\r\ngardens of the palace; while she wanders through the shady walks, a\r\nyoung girl sings a song of passion, the words of which stir Cressida to\r\nher very soul. Night falls,\r\n\r\n    And whyte thinges wexen dimme and donne;\r\n\r\nthe stars begin to light the heavens; Cressida returns pensive; the\r\nmurmurs of the city die out. Leaning at her window, facing the blue\r\nhorizon of Troas, with the trees of the garden at her feet, and bathed\r\nin the pale glimmers of the night, Cressida dreams, and as she dreams a\r\nmelody disturbs the silence: hidden in the foliage of a cedar, a\r\nnightingale is heard; they too, the birds, celebrate love. And when\r\nsleep comes, of what will she think in her dreams if not of love?\r\n\r\nShe is moved, but not vanquished; it will take yet many incidents; they\r\nwill all be small, trivial, insignificant, and will appear to her\r\nsolemn, superhuman, ordered by the gods. She may recover, at times,\r\nbefore Pandarus, her presence of mind, her childlike laugh, and baffle\r\nhis wiles: for the double-story continues. Cressida is still able to\r\nunravel the best-laid schemes of Pandarus, but she is less and less able\r\nto unravel the tangled web of her own sentiments. The meshes draw\r\ncloser; now she promises a sisterly friendship: even that had been\r\nalready invented in the fourteenth century. She can no longer see\r\nTroilus without blushing; he passes and bows: how handsome he is!\r\n\r\n    ... She hath now caught a thorn;\r\n    She shal not pulle it out this next wyke.\r\n    God sende mo swich thornes on to pyke![515]\r\n\r\nThe passion and merits of Troilus, the inventions of\r\nPandarus, the secret good-will of Cressida, a thunderstorm which breaks\r\nout opportunely (we know how impressionable Cressida is), lead to the\r\nresult which might be expected: the two lovers are face to face.\r\nTroilus, like a sensitive hero, swoons: for he is extremely sensitive;\r\nwhen the town acclaims him, he blushes and looks down; when he thinks\r\nhis beloved indifferent he takes to his bed from grief, and remains\r\nthere all day; in the presence of Cressida, he loses consciousness.\r\nPandarus revives him, and is not slow to perceive that he is no longer\r\nwanted:\r\n\r\n                   For ought I can espyen\r\n    This light nor I ne serven here of nought.\r\n\r\nAnd he goes, adding, however, one more recommendation:\r\n\r\n                      If ye ben wyse,\r\n    Swowneth not now, lest more folk aryse.[516]\r\n\r\nWhat says Cressida?--What may \"the sely larke seye\" when \"the sparhauk\"\r\nhas caught it? Cressida, however, says something, and, of all the\r\ninnumerable forms of avowal, chooses not the least sweet:\r\n\r\n    Ne hadde I er now, my swete herte dere\r\n    Ben yolde, y-wis, I were now not here![517]\r\n\r\nWere they happy?\r\n\r\n    But juggeth, ye that han ben at the feste\r\n    Of swich gladnesse.[518]\r\n\r\nThe gray morn appears in the heavens; the shriek of \"the cok, comune\r\nastrologer,\" is heard; the lovers sing their song of dawn.[519] All the\r\nvirtues of Troilus are increased and intensified by happiness; it is\r\nthe eternal thesis of poets who are in love with love.\r\n\r\nThe days and weeks go by: each one of our characters pursues his part.\r\nPandarus is very proud of his; what could one reproach him with? He does\r\nunto others as he would be done by; he is disinterested; he has moreover\r\ncertain principles of honour, that limit themselves, it is true, to\r\nrecommending secrecy, which he does not fail to do. Can a reasonable\r\nwoman expect more?\r\n\r\nCalchas and the Greeks claim Cressida, and the Trojans decide to give\r\nher up. The unhappy young woman faints, but must needs submit. In an\r\nexcellent scene of comedy, Chaucer shows her receiving the\r\ncongratulations of the good souls of the town: so she is going to see\r\nonce more her worthy father, how happy she must be! The good souls\r\ninsist very much, and pay interminable visits.[520]\r\n\r\nShe goes, swearing to return, come what may, within ten days. The\r\nhandsome Diomedes escorts her; and the event proves, what experience\r\nalone could teach, and what she was herself far from suspecting, that\r\nshe loved Troilus, no doubt, above all men, but likewise, and apart from\r\nhim, love. She is used to the poison, and can no longer do without it;\r\nshe prefers Troilus, but to return to him is not so easy as she had\r\nthought, and to love or not to love is now for her a question of being\r\nor being not. Troilus, who from the start had most awful presentiments,\r\nfeeling that, happen what may, his happiness is over, though yet not\r\ndoubting Cressida, writes the most pressing letters, and signs them in\r\nFrench, \"le vostre T.\" Cressida replies by little short letters (that\r\nshe signs \"la vostre C.\"), in which she excuses herself for her brevity.\r\nThe length of a letter means nothing; besides she never liked to write,\r\nand where she is now it is not convenient to do it; let Troilus rest\r\neasy, he can count upon her friendship, she will surely return; true,\r\nit will not be in ten days; it will be when she can.[521]\r\n\r\nTroilus is told of his misfortune, but he will never believe it:\r\n\r\n    \"Thou seyst nat sooth,\" quod he, \"thou sorceresse!\"\r\n\r\nA brooch torn from Diomedes which he had given her on the day of\r\nparting,\r\n\r\n    In remembraunce of him and of his sorwe,\r\n\r\nallows him to doubt no more, and he gets killed by Achilles after a\r\nfurious struggle.\r\n\r\nAs we have drawn nearer to the catastrophe, the tone of the poem has\r\nbecome more melancholy and more tender. The narrator cannot help loving\r\nhis two heroes, even the faithless Cressida; he remains at least\r\nmerciful for her, and out of mercy, instead of letting us behold her\r\nnear as formerly, in the alleys or on her balcony, dreaming in the\r\nstarlight, he shows her only from afar, lost among the crowd in which\r\nshe has chosen to mix, the crowd in every sense, the crowd of mankind\r\nand the crowd of sentiments, all commonplace. Let us, he thinks,\r\nremember only the former Cressida.\r\n\r\nHe ends with reflections which are resigned, almost sad, and he\r\ncontemplates with a tranquil look the juvenile passions he has just\r\ndepicted. Troilus, resigned too, beholds, from heaven, the field under\r\nthe walls of Troy, where he was slain, and smiles at the remembrance of\r\nhis miseries; and Chaucer, transforming Boccaccio's conclusion like all\r\nthe rest, addresses a touching appeal, and wise, even religious advice,\r\nto you,\r\n\r\n    O yonge fresshe folkes, he or she,\r\n    In which that love up groweth with your age.[522]\r\n\r\nThis return to seriousness is quite as noteworthy as the mixture of\r\neveryday life, added by the poet to the idea borrowed from his model. By\r\nthese two traits, which will be seen again from century to century, in\r\nEnglish literature, Chaucer manifests his true English character; and if\r\nwe wish to see precisely in what consists the difference between this\r\ntemperament and that of the men of the South, whom Chaucer was\r\nnevertheless so akin to, let us compare this conclusion with that of the\r\n\"Filostrato\" as translated at the same time into French by Pierre de\r\nBeauveau: \"You will not believe lightly those who give you ear; young\r\nwomen are wilful and lovely, and admire their own beauty, and hold\r\nthemselves haughty and proud amidst their lovers, for vain-glory of\r\ntheir youth; who, although they be gentle and pretty more than tongue\r\ncan say, have neither sense nor firmness, but are variable as a leaf in\r\nthe wind.\" Unlike Chaucer, Pierre de Beauveau contents himself with such\r\ngraceful moralisation,[523] which will leave no very deep impression on\r\nthe mind, and which indeed could not, for it is itself as light as \"a\r\nleaf in the wind.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nAfter 1379 Chaucer ceased to journey on the Continent, and until his\r\ndeath he lived in England an English life. He saw then several aspects\r\nof that life which he had not yet known from personal experience. After\r\nhaving been page, soldier, prisoner of the French, squire to the king,\r\nnegotiator in Flanders, France, and Italy, he entered Westminster the\r\n1st of October, 1386, as member of Parliament; the county of Kent had\r\nchosen for its representatives: \"Willielmus Betenham\" and \"Galfridus\r\nChauceres.\"[524] It was one of the great sessions of the reign, and one\r\nof the most stormy; the ministers of Richard II. were impeached, and\r\namong others the son of the Hull wool merchant, Michel de la Pole,\r\nChancellor of the kingdom. For having remained faithful to his\r\nprotectors, the king and John of Gaunt, Chaucer, looked upon with ill\r\nfavour by the men then in power, of whom Gloucester was the head, lost\r\nhis places and fell into want. Then the wheel of Fortune revolved, and\r\nnew employments offered a new field to his activity. At the end of three\r\nyears, Richard, having dismissed the Council which Parliament had\r\nimposed upon him, took the authority into his own hands, and the poet,\r\nsoldier, member of Parliament, and diplomate, was appointed clerk of the\r\nroyal works (1389). For two years he had to attend to the constructions\r\nand repairs at Westminster, at the Tower, at Berkhamsted, Eltham, Sheen,\r\nat St. George's Chapel, Windsor, and in many others of those castles\r\nwhich he had described, with \"pinacles, imageries, and tabernacles,\"\r\nand\r\n\r\n                ful eek of windowes\r\n    As flakes falle in grete snowes.[525]\r\n\r\nHis great literary occupation, during that time, was the composition of\r\nhis famous \"Canterbury Tales.\"[526] Experience had ripened him; he had\r\nread all there was to read, and seen all there was to see; he had\r\nvisited the principal countries where civilisation had developed: he had\r\nobserved his compatriots at work on their estates and in their\r\nparliaments, in their palaces and in their shops. Merchants, sailors,\r\nknights, pages, learned men of Oxford and suburban quacks, men of the\r\npeople and men of the Court, labourers, citizens, monks, priests, sages\r\nand fools, heroes and knaves, had passed in crowds beneath his\r\nscrutinising gaze; he had associated with them, divined them, and\r\nunderstood them; he was prepared to describe them all.\r\n\r\nOn an April day, in the reign of Richard II., in the noisy suburb of\r\nSouthwark, the place for departures and arrivals, with streets bordered\r\nwith inns, encumbered with horses and carts, resounding with cries,\r\ncalls, and barks, one of those mixed troops, such as the hostelries of\r\nthat time often gathered together, seats itself at the common board, in\r\nthe hall of the \"Tabard, faste by the Belle\"[527]; the inns were all\r\nclose to each other. It was springtime, the season of fresh flowers, the\r\nseason of love, the season, too, of pilgrimages. Knights returned from\r\nthe wars go to render thanks to the saints for having let them behold\r\nagain their native land; invalids render thanks for their restoration to\r\nhealth; others go to ask Heaven's grace. Does not every one need it?\r\nEvery one is there; all England.\r\n\r\nThere is a knight who has warred, all Europe over, against heathens and\r\nSaracens. It was easy to meet them; they might be found in Prussia and\r\nin Spain, and our \"verray parfit gentil knight\" had massacred enormous\r\nnumbers of them \"at mortal batailles fiftene\" for \"our faith.\" Next to\r\nhim, a squire who had, like Chaucer, fought in France, with May in his\r\nheart, a song upon his lips, amorous, elegant, charming, embroidered as\r\na meadow--\"as it were a mede\"--with white and red flowers; a stout\r\nmerchant, who looked so rich, was so well furred, and \"fetisly\" dressed\r\nthat\r\n\r\n    Ther wiste no wight that he was in dette;\r\n\r\na modest clerk, who had come from the young University of Oxford, poor,\r\npatched, threadbare, with hollow cheeks, mounted on a lean horse, and\r\nwhose little all consisted in\r\n\r\n    Twenty bokes, clad in blak and reed;\r\n\r\nan honest country franklin, with \"sangwyn\" visage and beard white \"as is\r\nthe dayesye,\" a sort of fourteenth-century Squire Western, kindly,\r\nhospitable, good-humoured, holding open table, with fish and roasts and\r\n_sauce piquante_ and beer all day long, so popular in the county that,\r\n\r\n    Ful ofte tyme he was knight of the shire;\r\n\r\na shipman who knew every creek, from Scotland to Spain, and had\r\nencountered many a storm, with his good ship \"the Maudelayne,\"\r\n\r\n    With many a tempest hadde his berd been shake;\r\n\r\na physician who had driven a thriving trade during the plague, learned,\r\nand acquainted with the why and the wherefore of every disease,\r\n\r\n    Were it of hoot or cold, or moiste or drye;\r\n\r\nwho knew by heart Hippocrates and Galen, but was on bad terms with the\r\nChurch, for\r\n\r\n    His studie was but litel on the Bible.\r\n\r\nWith them, a group of working men from London, a haberdasher, a\r\ncarpenter, dyer, weaver, and cook; people from the country, a ploughman,\r\na miller,\r\n\r\n    His mouth as greet was as a great forneys,\r\n\r\na group of men-at-law devoured with cares, close shaven, bitter of\r\nspeech--\r\n\r\n    Ful longe were his legges, and ful lene,\r\n    Y-lyk a staf, ther was no calf y-sene--\r\n\r\nbringing out their Latin on every occasion, terrible as adversaries, but\r\neasy to win over for money, and after all, as Chaucer himself says, \"les\r\nmeilleurs fils du monde\":\r\n\r\n    A bettre felawe sholde men noght finde.\r\n\r\nThen a group of Church-folk, men and women, of every garb and every\r\ncharacter, from the poor parish priest, who lives like a saint, obscure\r\nand hidden, visiting, in rain and cold, the scattered cottages of his\r\npeasants, forgetting to receive his tithes, a model of abnegation, to\r\nthe hunting monk, dressed like a layman, big, fat, with a head as shiny\r\nas a ball, who will make one day the finest abbot in the world, to the\r\ndegenerate friar, who lives at the expense of others, a physician become\r\npoisoner, who destroys instead of healing them, and to the pardoner, a\r\nrascal of low degree, who bestows heaven at random by his own \"heigh\r\npower\" on whoever will pay, and who manufactures precious relics out of\r\nthe pieces of his \"old breech.\" Finally there are nuns, reserved, quiet,\r\nneat as ermines, who are going to hear on the way enough to scandalise\r\nthem all the rest of their lives. Among them, Madame Eglantine, the\r\nprioress, with her French of Stratford,\r\n\r\n    For Frensh of Paris was to hir unknowe,\r\n\r\nwho imitated the style of the Court, and, consequently,\r\n\r\n    Ne wette hir fingres in hir sauce depe.\r\n\r\nShe was \"so pitous\" that she wept to see a mouse caught, or if one of\r\nher little dogs died. Can one be more \"pitous\"?\r\n\r\nAll those personages there were, and many more besides. There was the\r\nWife of Bath, that incomparable gossip, screaming all the louder as she\r\nwas \"som-del deef.\" There was the jovial host, Harry Bailey, used to\r\ngovern and command, and to drown with his brazen voice the tumult of the\r\ncommon table. There is also a person who looks thoughtful and kindly,\r\nwho talks little but observes everything, and who is going to\r\nimmortalise the most insignificant words pronounced, screamed, grumbled,\r\nor murmured by his companions of a day, namely, Chaucer himself. With\r\nits adventurers, its rich merchants, its Oxford clerks, its members of\r\nParliament, its workmen, its labourers, its saints, its great poet, it\r\nis indeed the new England, joyous, noisy, radiant, all youthful and full\r\nof life, that sits down, this April evening, at the board of \"the Tabard\r\nfaste by the Belle.\" Where are now the Anglo-Saxons? But where are the\r\nlast year's snows? April has come.\r\n\r\nThe characters of romance, the statues on cathedrals, the figures in\r\nmissals, had been heretofore slender or slim, or awkward or stiff;\r\nespecially those produced by the English. Owing to one or the other of\r\nthese defects, those representations were not true to nature. Now we\r\nhave, in an English poem, a number of human beings, drawn from the\r\noriginal, whose movements are supple, whose types are as varied as in\r\nreal life, depicted exactly as they were in their sentiments and in\r\ntheir dress, so that it seems we see them, and when we part the\r\nconnection is not broken. The acquaintances made at \"the Tabard faste by\r\nthe Belle\" are not of those that can be forgotten; they are life-long\r\nremembrances.\r\n\r\nNothing is omitted which can serve to fix, to anchor in our memory, the\r\nvision of these personages. A half-line, that unveils the salient trait\r\nof their characters, becomes impossible to forget; their attitudes,\r\ntheir gestures, their clothes, their warts, the tones of their voices,\r\ntheir defects of pronunciation--\r\n\r\n    Somwhat he lipsed for his wantonnesse--\r\n\r\ntheir peculiarities, the host's red face and the reeve's yellow one,\r\ntheir elegances, their arrows with peacock feathers, their bagpipes,\r\nnothing is left out; their horses and the way they ride them are\r\ndescribed; Chaucer even peeps inside their bags and tells us what he\r\nfinds there.\r\n\r\nSo the new England has its Froissart, who is going to tell feats of arms\r\nand love stories glowing with colour, and take us hither and thither,\r\nthrough highways and byways, giving ear to every tale, observing,\r\nnoting, relating? This young country has Froissart and better than\r\nFroissart. The pictures are as vivid and as clear, but two great\r\ndifferences distinguish the ones from the others: humour and sympathy.\r\nAlready we find humour well developed in Chaucer; his sly jests\r\npenetrate deeper than French jests; he does not go so far as to wound,\r\nbut he does more than merely prick skin-deep; and in so doing, he\r\nlaughs silently to himself. There was once a merchant,\r\n\r\n    That riche was, for which men helde him wys.[528]\r\n\r\nThe \"Sergeant of Lawe\" was a busy man indeed:\r\n\r\n    No wher so bisy a man as he ther nas,\r\n    And yet he semed bisier than he was.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Chaucer sympathises; he has a quivering heart that tears move,\r\nand that all sufferings touch, those of the poor and those of princes.\r\nThe role of the people, so marked in English literature, affirms itself\r\nhere, from the first moment. \"There are some persons,\" says, for his\r\njustification, a French author, \"who think it beneath them to bestow a\r\nglance on what opinion has pronounced ignoble; but those who are a\r\nlittle more philosophic, who are a little less the dupes of the\r\ndistinctions that pride has introduced into the affairs of this world,\r\nwill not be sorry to see the sort of man there is inside a coachman, and\r\nthe sort of woman inside a petty shopkeeper.\" Thus, by a great effort of\r\naudacity, as it seems to him, Marivaux expresses himself in 1731.[529]\r\nChaucer, even in the fourteenth century, is curious to see the sort of\r\nman a cook of London may be, and the sort of woman a Wife of Bath is.\r\nHow many wretches perish in Froissart! What blood; what hecatombs; and\r\nhow few tears! Scarcely here and there, and far apart, words absently\r\nspoken about so much suffering: \"And died the common people of hunger,\r\nwhich was great pity.\"[530] Why lament long, or marvel at it? It is the\r\nbusiness and proper function of the common people to be cut to pieces;\r\nthey are the raw material of feats of arms, and as such only figure in\r\nthe narrative.\r\n\r\nThey figure in Chaucer's narrative, because Chaucer _loves_ them; he\r\nloves his plowman, \"a true swinker and a good,\" who has strength enough\r\nand to spare in his two arms, and helps his neighbours for nothing; he\r\nsuffers at the thought of the muddy lanes along which his poor parson\r\nmust go in winter, through the rain, to visit a distant cottage. The\r\npoet's sympathy is broad; he loves, as he hates, with all his heart.\r\n\r\nOne after another, all these persons of such diverse conditions have\r\ngathered together, twenty-nine in all. For one day they have the same\r\nobject in view, and are going to live a common life. Fifty-six miles\r\nfrom London is the shrine, famous through all Europe, which contains the\r\nremains of Henry the Second's former adversary, the Chancellor Thomas\r\nBecket, assassinated on the steps of the altar, and canonised.[531]\r\nMounted each on his steed, either good or bad, the knight on a beast\r\nsturdy, though of indifferent appearance; the hunting monk on a superb\r\npalfrey, \"as broun as is a berye\"; the Wife of Bath sitting astride her\r\nhorse, armed with great spurs and showing her red stockings, they set\r\nout, taking with them mine host of the \"Tabard,\" and there they go, at\r\nan easy pace, along the sunny road lined with hedges, among the gentle\r\nundulations of the soil. They will cross the Medway; they will pass\r\nbeneath the walls of Rochester's gloomy keep, then one of the principal\r\nfortresses of the kingdom, but sacked recently by revolted peasantry;\r\nthey will see the cathedral built a little lower down, and, as it were,\r\nin its shade. There are women and bad riders in the group; the miller\r\nhas drunk too much, and can hardly sit in the saddle; the way will be\r\nlong.[532] To make it seem short, each one will relate two tales, and\r\nthe troop, on its return, will honour by a supper the best teller.\r\n\r\nUnder the shadow of great romances, shorter stories had sprung up. The\r\nforest of romance was now losing its leaves, and the stories were\r\nexpanding in the sunlight. The most celebrated collection was\r\nBoccaccio's, written in delightful Italian prose, a many-sided work,\r\nedifying and licentious at the same time, a work audacious in every way,\r\neven from a literary point of view. Boccaccio knows it, and justifies\r\nhis doings. To those who reproach him with having busied himself with\r\n\"trifles,\" neglecting \"the Muses of Parnassus,\" he replies: Who knows\r\nwhether I have neglected them so very much? \"Perhaps, while I wrote\r\nthose tales of such humble mien, they may have come sometimes and seated\r\nthemselves at my side.\"[533] They bestowed the same favour on Chaucer.\r\n\r\nThe idea of \"Troilus and Criseyde,\" borrowed from Boccaccio, had been\r\ntransformed; the general plan and the setting of the \"Tales\" are\r\nmodified more profoundly yet. In Boccaccio, it is always young noblemen\r\nand ladies who talk: seven young ladies, \"all of good family, beautiful,\r\nelegant, and virtuous,\" and three young men, \"all three affable and\r\nelegant,\" whom the misfortunes of the time \"did not affect so much as to\r\nmake them forget their amours.\" The great plague has broken out in\r\nFlorence; they seek a retreat \"wherein to give themselves up to mirth\r\nand pleasure\"; they fix upon a villa half-way to Fiesole, now villa\r\nPalmieri.\r\n\r\n\"A fine large court, disposed in the centre, was surrounded by\r\ngalleries, halls and chambers all ornamented with the gayest paintings.\r\nThe dwelling-house rose in the midst of meadows and magnificent gardens,\r\nwatered by cool streams; the cellars were full of excellent wines.\"\r\nEvery one is forbidden, \"whencesoever he may come, or whatever he may\r\nhear or see, to bring hither any news from without that be not\r\nagreeable.\" They seat themselves \"in a part of the garden which the\r\nfoliage of the trees rendered impenetrable to the sun's rays,\" at the\r\ntime when, \"the heat being in all its strength, one heard nothing save\r\nthe cicadae singing among the olive-trees.\" Thanks to the stories they\r\nrelate to each other, they pleasantly forget the scourge which threatens\r\nthem, and the public woe; yonder it is death; here they play.\r\n\r\nChaucer has chosen for himself a plan more humane, and truer to nature.\r\nIt is not enough for him to saunter each day from a palace to a garden;\r\nhe is not content with an alley, he must have a road. He puts his whole\r\ntroop of narrators in motion; he stops them at the inns, takes them to\r\ndrink at the public-houses, obliges them to hurry their pace when\r\nevening comes, causes them to make acquaintance with the passers-by. His\r\npeople move, bestir themselves, listen, talk, scream, sing, exchange\r\ncompliments, sometimes blows; for if his knights are real knights, his\r\nmillers are real millers, who swear and strike as in a mill.\r\n\r\nThe interest of each tale is doubled by the way in which it is told, and\r\neven by the way it is listened to. The knight delights his audience,\r\nwhich the monk puts to sleep and the miller causes to laugh; one is\r\nheard in silence, the other is interrupted at every word. Each story is\r\nfollowed by a scene of comedy, lively, quick, unexpected, and amusing;\r\nthey discuss, they approve, they lose their tempers; no strict rules,\r\nbut all the independence of the high-road, and the unforeseen of real\r\nlife; we are not sauntering in alleys! Mine host himself, with his deep\r\nvoice and his peremptory decisions, does not always succeed in making\r\nhimself obeyed. After the knight's tale, he would like another in the\r\nsame style to match it; but he will have to listen to the miller's,\r\nwhich, on the contrary, will serve as a contrast. He insists; the miller\r\nshouts, he shouts \"in Pilates vois,\" he threatens to leave them all and\r\n\"go his wey\" if they prevent him from talking. \"Wel,\" says the host,\r\n\r\n             \"Tel on, a devel wey!\r\n    Thou art a fool, thy wit is overcome,\"\r\n\r\nWhat would Donna Pampinea and Donna Filomena have said, hearing such\r\nwords?\r\n\r\nAt other times the knight is obliged to interfere, and then the tone is\r\nvery different. He does not have to scream; a word from him is enough,\r\nand the storms are calmed. Moreover, the host himself becomes more\r\ngentle at times; this innkeeper knows whom he has to deal with; with all\r\nhis roughness, he has a rude notion of differences and distances. His\r\nlanguage is the language of an innkeeper; Chaucer never commits the\r\nfault of making him step out of his role; but the poet is too keen an\r\nobserver not to discern _nuances_ even in the temper of a jovial host.\r\nOne should see with what politeness and what salutations and what\r\nembarrassed compliments he informs the abbess that her turn has come to\r\nrelate a story:\r\n\r\n    \"My lady Prioresse, by your leve,\r\n    So that I wist I sholde yow nat greve,\r\n    I wolde demen that ye telle sholde\r\n    A tale next, if so were that ye wolde.\r\n    Now wol ye vouche-sauf, my lady dere?\"\r\n    --\"Gladly,\" quod she, and seyde as ye shal here.\r\n\r\nThe answer is not less suitable than the request.\r\n\r\nThus, in these little scenes, we see, put into action, the descriptions\r\nof the prologue; the portraits step out of their frames and come down\r\ninto the street; their limbs have become immediately supple and active;\r\nthe blood courses through their veins; life fills them to the end of\r\ntheir fingers. No sooner are they on their feet than they turn\r\nsomersaults or make courtesies; and by their words they charm, enliven,\r\nedify, or scandalise. Their personality is so accentuated that it makes\r\nthem unmanageable at times; their temper rules them; they are not\r\nmasters of their speech. The friar wants to tell a story, but he is so\r\nblinded by anger that he does not know where he is going; he stammers,\r\nhe chokes, and his narrative remains shapeless; the pardoner is so\r\nclosely bound to his profession that he cannot for a moment move out of\r\nit; shirt and skin make one, to use a familiar phrase of Montaigne's;\r\nhis tale resembles a sermon, and he concludes as though he were in\r\nchurch:\r\n\r\n    Now, goode men, God forgeve yow your trespas ...\r\n    I have relikes and pardon in my male\r\n    As faire as any man in Engelond ...\r\n    It is an honour to everich that is heer,\r\n    That ye mowe have a suffisant pardoneer\r\n    Tassoille yow, in contree as ye ryde,\r\n    For aventures which that may bityde.\r\n    Peraventure ther may falle oon or two\r\n    Doun of his hors, and breke his nekke atwo.\r\n    Look what a seuretee is it to yow alle\r\n    That I am in your felaweship y-falle,\r\n    That may assoille yow, bothe more and lasse,\r\n    Whan that the soule shal fro the body passe.\r\n    I rede that our hoste heer shal biginne,\r\n    For he is most envoluped in sinne.\r\n    Com forth sir hoste, and offre first anon,\r\n    And thou shalt kisse the reliks everichon,\r\n    Ye, for a grote! unbokel anon thy purs![534]\r\n\r\nA most happy idea! Mine host makes a reply which cannot be repeated.\r\n\r\nIn other cases the personage is so wordy and impetuous that it is\r\nimpossible to stop him, or set him right, or interrupt him; he cannot\r\nmake up his mind to launch into his narrative; he must needs remain\r\nhimself on the stage and talk about his own person and belongings; he\r\nalone is a whole comedy. One must perforce keep silence when the Wife of\r\nBath begins to talk, irresistible gossip, chubby-faced, over-fed,\r\never-buzzing, inexhaustible in speech, never-failing in arguments, full\r\nof glee. She talks about what she knows, about her specialty; her\r\nspecialty is matrimony; she has had five husbands, \"three of hem were\r\ngode and two were badde;\" the last is still living, but she is already\r\nthinking of the sixth, because she does not like to wait, and because\r\nhusbands are perishable things; they do not last long with her; in her\r\neyes the weak sex is the male sex. She is not going to break her heart\r\nabout a husband who gives up the ghost; her conscience is easy; the\r\nspouse departs quite ready for a better world:\r\n\r\n    By God, in erthe I was his purgatorie,\r\n    For which I hope his soule be in glorie.\r\n\r\nSome praise celibacy, or reason about husbands' rights; the merry gossip\r\nwill answer them. She discusses the matter thoroughly; sets forth the\r\npros and cons; allows her husband to speak, then speaks herself; she has\r\nthe best arguments in the world; her husband, too, has excellent ones,\r\nbut it is she who has the very best. She is a whole _Ecole des Maris_ in\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nThe tales are of every sort,[535] and taken from everywhere. Chaucer\r\nnever troubled himself to invent any; he received them from all hands,\r\nbut he modelled them after his own fashion, and adapted them to his\r\ncharacters. They are borrowed from France, Italy, ancient Rome; the\r\nknight's tale is taken from Boccaccio, that of the nun's priest is\r\nimitated from the \"Roman de Renart\"; that of \"my lord the monk\" from\r\nLatin authors and from Dante, \"the grete poete of Itaille.\" The miller,\r\nthe reeve, the somnour, the shipman, relate coarse stories, and their\r\nlicentiousness somewhat embarrasses the good Chaucer, who excuses\r\nhimself for it. It is not he who talks, it is his road-companions; and\r\nit is the Southwark beer which inspires them, not he; you must blame the\r\nSouthwark beer. The manners of the people of the lower classes, their\r\nloves, their animosities and their jealousies, are described to the life\r\nin these narratives. We see how the jolly Absolon goes to work to charm\r\nthe carpenter's wife, who prefers Nicholas; he makes music under her\r\nwindows, and brings her little presents; he is careful of his attire,\r\nwears \"hoses rede,\" spreads out hair that shines like gold,\r\n\r\n    He kempte hise lokkes brode, and made him gay.\r\n\r\nIf on a feast-day they play a Mystery on the public place before the\r\nchurch, he gets the part of Herod allotted to him: who could resist a\r\nperson so much in view? Alison resists, however, not out of virtue, but\r\nbecause she prefers Nicholas. She does not require fine phrases to repel\r\nAbsolon's advances; village-folk are not so ceremonious:\r\n\r\n    Go forth thy wey, or I wol caste a ston.\r\n\r\nBlows abound in stories of that kind, and the personages go off with\r\n\"their back as limp as their belly,\" as we read in one of the narratives\r\nfrom which Chaucer drew his inspiration.\r\n\r\nNext to these great scenes of noise there are little familiar scenes,\r\nmarvellously observed, and described to perfection; scenes of home-life\r\nthat might tempt the pencil of a Dutch painter; views of the mysterious\r\nlaboratory where the alchemist, at once duped and duping, surrounded\r\nwith retorts, \"cucurbites and alembykes,\" his clothes burnt to holes,\r\nseeks to discover the philosopher's stone. They heat, they pay great\r\nattention, they stir the mixture;\r\n\r\n    The pot to-breketh, and farewel! al is go!\r\n\r\nThen they discuss; it is the fault of the pot, of the fire, of the\r\nmetal; it is just as I thought;\r\n\r\n    Som seyde, it was long on the fyr-making,\r\n    Som seyde, nay! it was on the blowing....\r\n    \"Straw,\" quod the thridde, \"ye been lewede and nyce,\r\n    It was nat tempred as it oghte be.\"\r\n\r\nA fourth discovers a fourth cause: \"Our fyr was nat maad of beech.\" What\r\nwonder, with so many causes for a failure, that it failed? We will begin\r\nover again.[536]\r\n\r\nOr else, we have representations of those interested visits that\r\nmendicant friars paid to the dying. The friar, low, trivial,\r\nhypocritical, approaches:\r\n\r\n    \"Deus hic,\" quod he, \"O Thomas, freend, good day.\"\r\n\r\nHe lays down his staff, wallet, and hat; he takes a seat, the cat was on\r\nthe bench, he makes it jump down; he settles himself; the wife bustles\r\nabout, he allows her to, and even encourages her. What could he eat? Oh!\r\nnext to nothing, a fowl's liver, a pig's head roasted, the lightest\r\nrepast; his \"stomak is destroyed;\"\r\n\r\n    My spirit hath his fostring in the Bible.\r\n\r\nHe thereupon delivers to the sick man a long and interested sermon,\r\nmingled with Latin words, in which the verb \"to give\" comes in at every\r\nline: whatever you do, don't give to others, give to me; give to my\r\nconvent, don't give to the convent next door:\r\n\r\n    A! yif that covent half a quarter otes!\r\n    A! yif that covent four and twenty grotes!\r\n    A! yif that frere a peny and let him go....\r\n    Thomas, of me thou shalt nat ben y-flatered;\r\n    Thou woldest ban our labour al for noght.[537]\r\n\r\nPay then, give then, give me this, or only that; Thomas gives less\r\nstill.\r\n\r\nFamiliar scenes, equally true but of a more pleasing kind, are found in\r\nother narratives, for instance in the story of Chauntecleer the cock, so\r\nwell localised with a few words, in a green, secluded country nook:\r\n\r\n    A poure widwe, somdel stope in age\r\n    Was whylom dwelling in a narwe cotage,\r\n    Bisyde a grove, standing in a dale.\r\n\r\nHer stable, her barn-yard are described; we hear the lowing of the cows\r\nand the crowing of the cock; the tone rises little by little, and we get\r\nto the mock-heroic style. Chauntecleer the cock,\r\n\r\n    In al the land of crowing nas his peer.\r\n    His vois was merier than the mery orgon\r\n    On messe-days that in the chirche gon;\r\n    Wel sikerer was his crowing in his logge\r\n    Than is a clokke, or an abbey orlogge....\r\n    His comb was redder than the fyn coral,\r\n    And batailed, as it were a castel-wal!\r\n\r\nHe had a black beak, white \"nayles,\" and azure legs; he reigned\r\nunrivalled over the hens in the barn-yard. One of the hens was his\r\nfavourite, the others filled subalternate parts. One day--\r\n\r\n    This storie is al-so trewe, I undertake\r\n    As is the book of Launcelot de Lake,\r\n    That wommen holde in ful gret reverence,\r\n\r\n--he was looking for \"a boterflye,\" and what should he see but a fox!\r\n\"Cok, cok!\" he cries, with a jump, and means to flee.\r\n\r\n        \"Gentil sire, allas! wher wol ye gon?\r\n    Be ye affrayed of me that am your freend?\"\r\n\r\nsays the good fox; I came only to hear you sing; you have the family\r\ntalent:\r\n\r\n    My lord your fader (God his soule blesse!),\r\n\r\nsang so well; but you sing better still. To sing better still, the cock\r\nshuts his eye, and the fox bears him off. Most painful adventure! It was\r\na Friday: such things always befall on Fridays.\r\n\r\n    O Gaufred, dere mayster soverayn,\r\n    That whan the worthy King Richard was slayn\r\n    With shot, compleynedest his deth so sore,\r\n    Why ne had I now thy sentence and thy lore,\r\n    The Friday for to chide, as diden ye?[538]\r\n\r\nGreat commotion in the barn-yard; and here we find a picture charming\r\nfor its liveliness: \"Out! harrow! and weyl-away! Ha, ha, the fox!\" every\r\none shrieks, yells, runs; the dogs bark,\r\n\r\n    Ran cow and calf, and eek the verray hogges;\r\n\r\nthe ducks scream,\r\n\r\n    The gees for fere flowen over the trees,\r\n\r\nand the bees come out of their hives. The prisoner is set free; he will\r\nbe more prudent another time; order reigns once more in the domains of\r\nChauntecleer.\r\n\r\nSide by side with such tales of animals, we have elegant stories of the\r\nRound Table, borrowed from the lays of \"thise olde gentil Britons,\" and\r\nwhich carry us back to a time when,\r\n\r\n    In tholde dayes of the King Arthour\r\n    Of which that Britons speken greet honour,\r\n    Al was this land fulfild of fayerye;\r\n    The elf-queen, with hir joly companye,\r\n    Daunced ful ofte in many a grene mede;\r\n\r\noriental legends, which the young squire will relate, with enchantments,\r\nmagic mirrors, a brass horse that transports its rider through the air,\r\nhere or there according as one touches a peg in its ears, an ancestor\r\ndoubtless of \"Clavilegno,\" the steed of Don Quixote in the Duchesse's\r\npark; biographies of Appius and Virginia, of Caesar, of Nero, of\r\nHolophernes, of Hugolino in the tower of hunger, taken from Roman\r\nhistory, the Bible and Dante; adventures of chivalry, in which figures\r\nTheseus, duke of Athens, where blood flows profusely, with all the\r\ndigressions and all the embellishments which still continued to please\r\ngreat men and great ladies, and that is why the story is told by the\r\nknight, and Chaucer retains purposely all the faults of that particular\r\nsort of story. In opposition to his usual custom, he contents himself\r\nhere with lending a little life to illuminations of manuscripts.[539]\r\n\r\nGrave personages relate grave stories, like canticles or sermons,\r\ncoloured as with the light of stained glass, perfumed with incense,\r\naccompanied by organ music: story of the pious Constance, of St.\r\nCecilia, of a child killed by the Jews; dissertations of dame Prudence\r\n(a tale of wondrous dulness,[540] which Chaucer modestly ascribes to\r\nhimself); story of the patient Griselda; discourse of the poor parson. A\r\nwhile ago we were at the inn; now we are in church; in the Middle Ages\r\nstriking colours and decided contrasts were best liked; the faded tints\r\nthat have since been in fashion, mauve, cream, old-green, did not touch\r\nany one; and we know that Chaucer, when he was a page, had a superb\r\ncostume, of which one leg was red and the other black. Laughter was\r\ninextinguishable; it rose and fell and rose again, rebounding\r\nindefinitely; despair was immeasurable; the sense of _measure_ was\r\nprecisely what was wanting; its vulgarisation was one of the results of\r\nthe Renaissance. Panegyrics and satires were readily carried to the\r\nextreme. The logical spirit, propagated among the learned by a\r\nscholastic education, was producing its effect: writers drew apart one\r\nsingle quality or characteristic and descanted upon it, neglecting all\r\nthe rest. Thus it is that Griselda becomes Patience, and Janicola\r\nPoverty, and that by an easy and imperceptible transition the abstract\r\npersonages of novels and the drama are created: Cowardice, Valiance,\r\nVice. Those typical beings, whose names alone make us shudder, were\r\nconsidered perfectly natural; and, indeed, they bore a striking\r\nresemblance to Griselda, Janicola, and many other heroes of the most\r\npopular stories.\r\n\r\nThe success of Griselda is the proof of it. That poor girl, married to\r\nthe marquis of Saluces, who repudiates her in order to try her patience,\r\nand then gives her back her position of wife, enjoyed an immense\r\npopularity. Boccaccio had related her misfortunes in the \"Decameron\";\r\nPetrarch thought the story so beautiful that it appeared to him worthy\r\nof that supreme honour, a Latin translation: Chaucer translated it in\r\nhis turn from Latin into English, and made of it his Clerk of Oxford's\r\ntale;[541] it was turned several times into French.[542] Pinturicchio\r\nrepresented the adventures of Griselda in a series of pictures, now\r\npreserved in the National Gallery; the story furnished the subject of\r\nplays in Italy, in France, and in England.[543] These exaggerated\r\ndescriptions were just what went to the very heart; people wept over\r\nthem in the fourteenth century as over Clarissa in the eighteenth.\r\nPetrarch, writing to Boccaccio about Griselda, uses almost the same\r\nterms as Lady Bradshaigh, writing to Richardson about Clarissa:\r\n\r\n\"Had you seen me, I surely should have moved your pity. When alone, in\r\nagonies would I lay down the book, take it up again, walk about the\r\nroom, let fall a flood of tears, wipe my eyes, read again--perhaps not\r\nthree lines--throw away the book, crying out: 'Excuse me, good Mr.\r\nRichardson, I cannot go on; it is your fault, you have done more than I\r\ncan bear.'\"[544]\r\n\r\nI made \"one of our mutual friends from Padua,\" writes Petrarch, \"a man\r\nof elevated mind and vast learning, read this story. He had hardly got\r\nhalf through, when suddenly he stopped, choking with tears; a moment\r\nafter, having composed himself, he took up the narrative once more to\r\ncontinue reading, and, behold, a second time sobs stopped his utterance.\r\nHe declared it was impossible for him to continue, and he made a person\r\nof much instruction, who accompanied him, finish the reading.\" About\r\nthat time, in all probability, Petrarch, who, as we see in the same\r\nletter, liked to renew the experience, gave the English poet and\r\nnegotiator, who had come to visit him in his retreat, this tale to read,\r\nand Chaucer, for that very reason less free than with most of his other\r\nstories, scarcely altered anything in Petrarch's text. With him as with\r\nhis model, Griselda is Patience, nothing more; everything is sacrificed\r\nto that virtue; Griselda is neither woman nor mother; she is only the\r\npatient spouse, Patience made wife. They take her daughter from her, to\r\nbe killed, as they tell her, by order of the marquis. So be it, replies\r\nGriselda:\r\n\r\n    \"Goth now,\" quod she, \"and dooth my lordes heste;\r\n    But o thing wil I preye yow of your grace.\r\n    That, but my lord forbad yow, atte leste,\r\n    Burieth this litel body in som place,\r\n    That bestes ne no briddes it to-race.\"\r\n    But he no word wol to that purpos seye,\r\n    But took the child and wente upon his weye.[545]\r\n\r\nWhereupon every one goes into ecstasies, and is greatly affected. The\r\nidea of entreating her husband, of throwing herself at his feet, of\r\ntrying to move him, never enters her mind; she would no longer be\r\nplaying her part, which is not to be a mother, but to be: Patience.\r\n\r\nChaucer left his collection of tales uncompleted; we have less than the\r\nhalf of it; but he wrote enough to show to the best his manifold\r\nqualities. There appear in perfect light his masterly gifts of\r\nobservation, of comprehension, and of sympathy; we well see with what\r\nart he can make his characters stand forth, and how skilfully they are\r\nchosen to represent all contemporaneous England. The poet shows himself\r\nfull of heart, and at the same time full of sense; he is not without\r\nsuspicion that his pious stories, indispensable to render his picture\r\ncomplete, may offend by their monotony and exaggerated good sentiments.\r\nIn giving them place in his collection, he belongs to his time and helps\r\nto make it known; but a few mocking notes, scattered here and there,\r\nshow that he is superior to his epoch, and that, in spite of his long\r\ndissertations and his digressions, he has, what was rare at that period,\r\na certain notion, at least theoretical, of the importance of proportion.\r\nHe allows his heroes to speak, but he is not their dupe; in fact he is\r\nso little their dupe that sometimes he can stand their talk no longer,\r\nand interrupts them or laughs at them to their very face. He laughs in\r\nthe face of the tiresome Constance, on the night of her wedding; he\r\nshows us his companions riding drowsily on their horses to the sound of\r\nthe monk's solemn stories, and hardly preserved from actual slumber by\r\nthe noise of the horse's bells. He allows the host abruptly to interrupt\r\nhim when, to satirise the romances of chivalry, he relates, in \"rym\r\ndogerel,\" the feats of arms and marvellous adventures of the matchless\r\nSir Thopas.[546] Before we could even murmur the word \"improbable,\" he\r\nwarns us that the time of Griseldas has passed, and that there exist no\r\nmore such women in our day. As the pilgrims draw near Canterbury, and it\r\nbecomes seemly to finish on a graver note, he causes his poor parson to\r\nspeak, and the priest announces beforehand that his discourse will be a\r\nsermon, a real sermon, with a text from Scripture: \"Incipit sermo,\" says\r\none of the manuscripts. He will speak in prose, as in church:\r\n\r\n    Why sholde I sowen draf out of my fest,\r\n    Whan I may sowen whete if that me lest?\r\n\r\nAll agree, and it is with the assent of his companions, who become more\r\nserious as they approach the holy city, that he commences, for the good\r\nof their souls, his ample \"meditation.\" The coarse story told by the\r\nmiller had been justified by excuses no less appropriate to the person\r\nand to the circumstances; the person was a clown, and chanced to be\r\ndrunk; now the person is a saint, and, as it happens, they are just\r\nnearing the place of pilgrimage.\r\n\r\nThe good sense which caused the poet to write his \"Canterbury Tales\"\r\naccording to a plan so conformable to reason and to nature, is one of\r\nthe most eminent of Chaucer's qualities. It reveals itself in the\r\ndetails as in the whole scheme, and inspires him, in the midst of his\r\nmost fanciful inventions, with reassuring remarks which show that earth\r\nand real life are not far away, and that we are not in danger of falling\r\nfrom the clouds. He reminds us at an opportune moment that there is a\r\ncertain nobility, the highest of all, which cannot be bequeathed in a\r\nwill; that the corrupt specimens of a social class should not cause the\r\nwhole class to be condemned:\r\n\r\n    Of every ordre som shrewe is, parde;[547]\r\n\r\nthat, in the education of children, parents should be careful not to\r\ntreat them too soon as men; if one takes them to merry-makings before\r\ntime, they become \"to sone rype and bold, ... which is ful perilous.\" He\r\nexpresses himself very freely about great captains, each of whom would\r\nhave been called \"an outlawe or a theef\" had they done less harm.[548]\r\nThis last idea is put forth in a few lines of a humour so truly English\r\nthat it is impossible not to think of Swift and Fielding; and, indeed,\r\nFielding can the more appropriately be named here as he has devoted all\r\nhis novel of \"Jonathan Wild the Great\" to the expounding of exactly the\r\nsame thesis.\r\n\r\nFinally, we owe to this same common sense of Chaucer's a thing more\r\nremarkable yet: namely, that with his knowledge of Latin and of French,\r\nand living in a circle where those two languages were in great favour,\r\nhe wrote solely in English. His prose, like his verse, his \"Treatise on\r\nthe Astrolabe\" like his tales, are in English. He belongs to the English\r\nnation, and that is why he writes in that language; a reason of that\r\nsort is sufficient for him: \"Suffyse to thee thise trewe conclusiouns in\r\nEnglish, as wel as suffyseth to thise noble clerkes Grekes thise same\r\nconclusiouns in Greek, and to Arabians in Arabik, and to Jewes in Ebrew,\r\nand to the Latin folk in Latin.\" Chaucer, then, will make use of plain\r\nEnglish, \"naked wordes in English\"; he will employ the national\r\nlanguage, the king's English--\"the king that is lord of this\r\nlangage.\"[549] And he will use it, as in truth he did, to express\r\nexactly his thoughts and not to embellish them; he hates travesty, he\r\nworships truth; he wants words and things to be in the closest possible\r\nrelation:\r\n\r\n    The wordes mote be cosin to the dede.[550]\r\n\r\nThe same wisdom is again the cause why Chaucer does not spend himself in\r\nvain efforts to attempt impossible reforms, and to go against the\r\ncurrent. It has been made a subject of reproach to him in our day; and\r\nsome, from love of the Saxon past, have been indignant at the number of\r\nFrench words Chaucer uses; why did he not go back to the origins of the\r\nlanguage? But Chaucer was not one of those who, as Milton says, think\r\n\"to pound up the crows by shutting their park gates;\" he employed the\r\nnational tongue, as it existed in his day; the proportion of French\r\nwords is not greater with him than with the mass of his contemporaries.\r\nThe words he made use of were living and fruitful, since they are still\r\nalive, they and their families; the proportion of those that have\r\ndisappeared is wonderfully small, seeing the time that has elapsed. As\r\nto the Anglo-Saxons, he retained, as did the nation, but without being\r\naware of it, something of their grave and powerful genius; it is not his\r\nfault if he ignored these ancestors; every one in his day ignored them,\r\neven such thinkers as Langland, in whom lived again with most force the\r\nspirit of the ancient Germanic race. The tradition was broken; in the\r\nliterary past one went back to the Conquest, and thence without\r\ntransition to \"thise olde gentil Britons.\" In his enumeration of\r\ncelebrated bards, Chaucer gives a place to Orpheus, to Orion, and to the\r\n\"Bret Glascurion\"; but no author of any \"Beowulf\" is named by him.\r\nShakespeare, in the same manner, will derive inspiration from the\r\nnational past; he will go back to the time of the Roses, to the time of\r\nthe Plantagenets, to the time of Magna Charta, and, passing over the\r\nAnglo-Saxon period, he will take from the Britons the stories of Lear\r\nand of Cymbeline.\r\n\r\nThe brilliancy with which Chaucer used this new tongue, the instant fame\r\nof his works, the clear proof afforded by his writings that English\r\ncould fit the highest and the lowest themes, assured to that idiom its\r\ndefinitive place among the great literary languages. English still had,\r\nin Chaucer's day, a tendency to resolve itself into dialects; as, in the\r\ntime of the Conquest, the kingdom had still a tendency to resolve itself\r\ninto sub-kingdoms. Chaucer knew this, and was concerned about it; he was\r\nanxious about those differences of tongue, of orthography, and of\r\nvocabulary; he did all in his power to regularise these discordances; he\r\nhad set ideas on the subject; and, what was rare in those days, the\r\nwhims of copyists made him shudder. Nothing shows better the faith he\r\nhad in the English tongue, as a literary language, than his reiterated\r\ninjunctions to the readers and scribes who shall read his poems aloud or\r\ncopy them. He experiences already, concerning his work, the anxieties of\r\nthe poets of the Renaissance:\r\n\r\n    And for ther is so greet diversitee\r\n    In English, and in writyng of our tonge,\r\n    So preye I God, that noon miswryte thee,\r\n    Ne thee mysmetre for defaute of tonge,\r\n    And red wher-so thou be, or elles songe,\r\n    That thou be understonde I God beseche![551]\r\n\r\nChaucer himself looked over the transcriptions done from his original\r\nmanuscripts by his amanuensis Adam; he corrected with minute care every\r\nfault; he calls down all manner of woe upon the \"scriveyn's\" head, if,\r\ncopying once more \"Boece\" or \"Troilus,\" he leaves as many errors\r\nagain.[552] We seem to hear Ronsard himself addressing his supplications\r\nto the reader: \"I implore of you one thing only, reader, to pronounce\r\nwell my verses and suit your voice to their passion ... and I implore\r\nyou again, where you will see this sign: (!) to raise your voice a\r\nlittle, to give grace to what you read.\"[553]\r\n\r\nChaucer's efforts were not exercised in vain; they assisted the work of\r\nconcentration. After him, the dialects lost their importance; the one he\r\nused, the East Midland dialect, has since become the language of the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nHis verse, too, is the verse of the new literature, formed by a\r\ncompromise between the old and the new prosody. Alliteration, which is\r\nnot yet dead, and which is still used in his time, he does not like; its\r\njingle seems to him ridiculous:\r\n\r\n    I can nat geste--run, ram, ruf--by lettre.[554]\r\n\r\nRidiculous, too, in his eyes is the \"rym dogerel\" of the popular\r\nromances of which \"Sir Thopas\" is the type. His verse is the rhymed\r\nverse, with a fixed number of accents or beats, and a variable number of\r\nsyllables. Nearly all the \"Tales\" are written in heroic verse, rhyming\r\ntwo by two in couplets and containing five accentuated syllables.\r\n\r\nThe same cheerful, tranquil common sense which made him adopt the\r\nlanguage of his country and the usual versification, which prevented him\r\nfrom reacting with excess against received ideas, also prevented his\r\nharbouring out of patriotism, piety, or pride, any illusions about his\r\ncountry, his religion, or his time. He belonged to them, however, as\r\nmuch as any one, and loved and honoured them more than anybody. Still\r\nthe impartiality of judgment of this former prisoner of the French is\r\nwonderful, superior even to Froissart's, who, the native of a\r\nborder-country, was by birth impartial, but who, as age crept on, showed\r\nin the revision of his \"Chronicles\" decided preferences. Towards the\r\nclose of the century Froissart, like the Limousin and the Saintonge,\r\nranked among the conquests recovered by France. Chaucer, from the\r\nbeginning to the end of his career, continues the same, and the fact is\r\nall the more remarkable because his turn of mind, his inspiration and\r\nhis literary ideal, become more and more English as he grows older. He\r\nremains impartial, or, rather, outside the great dispute, in which,\r\nhowever, he had actually taken part; his works do not contain a single\r\nline directed against France, nor even any praise of his country in\r\nwhich it is extolled as the successful rival of its neighbour.\r\n\r\nFor this cause Des Champs, a great enemy of the English, who had not\r\nonly ravaged the kingdom in general but burnt down his own private\r\ncountry house, made an exception in his hatred, and did homage to the\r\nwisdom and genius of the \"noble Geoffrey Chaucer,\" the ornament of the\r\n\"kingdom of Eneas,\" England.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nThe composition of the \"Canterbury Tales\" occupied the last years of\r\nChaucer's life. During the same period he also wrote his \"Treatise on\r\nthe Astrolabe\" in prose, for the instruction of his son Lewis,[555] and\r\na few detached poems, melancholy pieces in which he talks of shunning\r\nthe world and the crowd, asks the prince to help him in his poverty,\r\nretreats into his inner self, and becomes graver and more and more\r\nresigned:\r\n\r\n    Fle fro the prees, and dwelle with sothfastnesse,\r\n    Suffyce unto thy good, though hit be smal....\r\n    Forth, pilgrim, forth! Forth, beste out of thy stal!...\r\n    Hold the hye wey, and lat thy gost thee lede:\r\n    And trouth shal delivere, hit is no drede.[556]\r\n\r\nIn spite of this melancholy, he was at that time the uncontested king of\r\nEnglish letters; a life-long friendship bound him to Gower[557]; the\r\nyoung poets, Hoccleve, Scogan, Lydgate, came to him and proclaimed him\r\ntheir master. His face, the features of which are known to us, thanks to\r\nthe portrait we owe to Hoccleve, had gained an expression of gentle\r\ngravity; he liked better to listen than to talk, and, in the \"Canterbury\r\nTales,\" the host rallies him on his pensive air and downcast eyes:\r\n\r\n                    \"What man artow?\" quod he;\r\n    \"Thou lokest as thou woldest finde an hare,\r\n    For ever up-on the ground I see thee stare.\"\r\n\r\nAge had bestowed on him a corpulency which made him a match for Harry\r\nBailey himself.[558]\r\n\r\nWhen Henry IV. mounted the throne, within the four days that followed\r\nhis accession, he doubled the pension of the poet (Oct. 3, 1399), who\r\nthen hired, for two pounds thirteen shillings and four pence a year, a\r\nhouse in the garden of St. Mary's, Westminster. The lease is still\r\npreserved in the archives of the Abbey.[559] He passed away in the\r\nfollowing year, in that tranquil retreat, and was interred at\r\nWestminster, not far from the sepulchres where slept his patrons, Edward\r\nIII. and Richard II., in that wing of the transept which has since been\r\ncalled the Poets' Corner, where lately we saw Browning's coffin lowered,\r\nand where, but yesterday, Tennyson's was laid.\r\n\r\nNo English poet enjoyed a fame more constantly equal to itself. In the\r\nfifteenth century writers did scarcely anything but lament and copy him:\r\n\"Maister deere,\" said Hoccleve,\r\n\r\n    O maister deere and fadir reverent,\r\n      Mi maister Chaucer, flour of eloquence,\r\n    Mirour of fructuous entendement,\r\n      O universal fadir of science,\r\n      Allas that thou thyn excellent prudence\r\n        In thi bed mortel mightist noght byquethe![560]\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Renaissance Caxton printed his works twice,[561] and\r\nHenry VIII. made an exception in their favour in his prohibition of\r\n\"printed bokes, printed balades, ... and other fantasies.\"[562] Under\r\nElizabeth, Thynne annotated them,[563] Spenser declared that he \"of\r\nTityrus,\" that is of Chaucer, \"his songs did lere,\"[564] and Sidney\r\nexalted him to the skies.[565] In the seventeenth century Dryden\r\nrejuvenates his tales, in the eighteenth century the admiration is\r\nuniversal, and extends to Pope and Walpole.[566] In our time the learned\r\nmen of all countries have applied themselves to the task of commentating\r\nhis works and of disentangling his biography, a Society has been founded\r\nto publish the best texts of his writings,[567] and but lately his\r\n\"Legend of Good Women\" inspired with an exquisite poem the Laureate who\r\nsleeps to-day close to the great ancestor, beneath the stones of the\r\nfamous Abbey.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[448] The date 1328 has long but wrongly been believed to be the true\r\none. The principal documents concerning Chaucer are to be found in the\r\nAppendix to his biography by Sir H. Nicolas, in \"Poetical Works,\" ed. R.\r\nMorris, Aldine Poets, vol. i. p. 93 ff., in the \"Trial Forewords,\" of\r\nDr. Furnivall, 1871, and in the \"Life Records of Chaucer,\" 1875 ff.,\r\nChaucer Society. One of the municipal ordinances meant to check the\r\nfrauds of the vintners is signed by several members of the corporation,\r\nand among others by John Chaucer, 1342. See Riley, \"Memorials, of\r\nLondon,\" p. 211.\r\n\r\n[449] See the view of London, painted in the fifteenth century,\r\nobviously from nature, reproduced at the beginning of this vol., from\r\nMS.

Chaucer took part in another\r\ncampaign \"in partibus Franciae,\" in 1369.\r\n\r\n[454] On this see Furnivall, \"Chaucer as valet and esquire,\" Chaucer\r\nSociety, 1876.\r\n\r\n[455] A passage in Chaucer's \"Book of the Duchesse\" (1369), lines 30\r\nff., leaves little doubt as to the reality of the unlucky passion he\r\ndescribes. The poet interrupts the train of his speech to answer a\r\nsupposed question put to him as to the causes of his depression and\r\n\"melancolye\":\r\n\r\n    I holde hit be a siknesse\r\n    That I have suffred this eight yere,\r\n    And yet my bote is never the nere;\r\n    For ther is phisicien but oon,\r\n    That may me hele.\r\n\r\nProem of the \"Book.\" See, in connection with this, the \"Compleynte unto\r\nPite.\" Who was the loved one we do not know; could it be that the poet\r\nwas playing upon her name in such lines as these:\r\n\r\n    For kindly by your heritage right\r\n    Ye been annexed ever unto Bountee? (l. 71).\r\n\r\nThere were numerous families of Bonamy, Bonenfaut, Boncoeur. A William\r\nde Boncuor is named in the \"Excerpta e Rotulis Finium,\" of Roberts, vol.\r\nii. pp. 309, 431, 432.\r\n\r\n[456] The date of Chaucer's marriage has not been ascertained. We know\r\nthat his wife was called Philippa, that one Philippa Chaucer belonged to\r\nthe queen's household in 1366, and that the Philippa Chaucer, wife of\r\nthe poet, was at a later date in the service of the Duchess of\r\nLancaster, after having been in the service of the queen. It seems most\r\nlikely that the two women were the same person: same name, same\r\nfunction, same pension of ten marks, referred to in the same words in\r\npublic documents, for example: 1º 42 Ed. III., 1368, \"Philippae Chaucer\r\ncui dominus Rex decem marcas annuatim ad scaccarium percipiendas pro\r\nbono servitio per ipsam Philippam Philippe Regine Anglie impenso per\r\nliteras suas patentes nuper concessit....\" 2º 4 Ric. II., 1381,\r\n\"Philippae Chaucer nuper uni domicellarum Philippae nuper Regine\r\nAnglie\"--she had died in 1369--\"cui dominus Rex Edwardus avus Regis\r\nhujus X marcas annuatim ad scaccarium suum percipiendas pro bono\r\nservitio per ipsam tam eidem domino Regi quam dicte Regine impenso per\r\nliteras suas patentes nuper concessit ... in denariis sibi liberatis per\r\nmanus predicti Galfridi mariti sui....\" \"Poetical Works,\" ed. Morris, i.\r\np. 108. Who Philippa was by birth is doubtful, but it seems likely that\r\nshe was Philippa Roet, daughter of Sir Payne Roet, who hailed, like the\r\nqueen herself, from Hainault--hence her connection with the queen--and\r\nsister of Catherine Roet who became the mistress and then the third wife\r\nof John of Gaunt--hence the favour in which the poet and his family\r\nstood with the Lancastrians. It seems again very probable, though not\r\nabsolutely certain, that Thomas Chaucer, who used at different times\r\nboth the Chaucer and the Roet arms, Speaker of the House of Commons\r\nunder Henry V., a man of great influence, was one of the children of the\r\npoet.\r\n\r\n[457] Book iv. chap. 40.\r\n\r\n[458] Froissart declares concerning his own poems that he \"les commencha\r\na faire sus l'an de grace Nostre Seigneur, 1362.\" He wrote them \"a\r\nl'ayde de Dieu et d'Amours, et a le contemplation et plaisance de\r\npluisours haus et nobles signours et de pluisours nobles et vaillans\r\ndames.\" MS.

This flower enjoyed the same favour with the French models of\r\nChaucer. One of the ballads of Froissart has for its burden: \"Sus toutes\r\nflours j'aime la margherite\" (\"Le Paradis d'Amour,\" in \"Poesies,\" ed.\r\nScheler, Brussels, 1870, 3 vols. 8vo), vol. i. p. 49. Des Champs praised\r\nthe same flower; Machault wrote a \"Dit de la Marguerite\" (\"Oeuvres\r\nChoisies,\" ed. Tarbe, p. 123):\r\n\r\n    J'aim une fleur qui s'uevre et qui s'encline\r\n    Vers le soleil, de jour quand il chemine;\r\n    Et quand il est couchiez soubz sa courtine\r\n                Par nuit obscure,\r\n    Elle se clost ainsois que le jour fine.\r\n\r\n[460] Guillaume de Lorris wrote the first part of the \"Roman\" ab. 1237;\r\nJean de Meun wrote the second towards 1277. On the sources of the poem\r\nsee the important work of Langlois: \"Origines et Sources du Roman de la\r\nRose,\" Paris, 1891, 8vo. M. Langlois has traced the originals for 12,000\r\nout of the 17,500 lines of Jean de Meun; he is preparing (1894) a\r\nmuch-needed critical edition of the text.\r\n\r\n[461] One of them has a sort of biographical interest as having belonged\r\nto Sir Richard Stury, Chaucer's colleague in one of his missions (see\r\nbelow, p. 284); it was afterwards purchased for Thomas, duke of\r\nGloucester, son of Edward III., and is now in the British Museum, MS.\r\nRoyal 19 B xiii. \"Ceste livre est a Thomas fiz au Roy, duc de Glouc',\r\nachates dez executeurs Mons' Ric' Stury.\" It has curious miniatures\r\nexemplifying the way in which people pictured to themselves at that time\r\nOlympian gods and romance heroes. The \"Dieu d'amour\" figures as a tall\r\nperson with a tunic, a cloak, and a crown, a bow in his hand and large\r\nred wings on his back. See fol. 16, \"coment li diex d'amours navra\r\nl'amant de ses saietes.\"\r\n\r\n[462] \"A vous qui belles filles avez et bien les desirez a introduire a\r\nvie honneste, bailliez leur, bailliez le Rommant de la Rose, pour\r\naprendre a discerner le bien du mal, que diz-je, mais le mal du bien.

The first fragment ends with line 1705,\r\nleaving a sentence unfinished; between the second and third fragments\r\nthere is a gap of more than 5,000 lines. The first fragment alone might,\r\non account of its style and versification, be the work of Chaucer, but\r\nthis is only a surmise, and we have no direct proof of it.

Disease (probably diabetes) soon obliged Boccaccio to interrupt\r\nhis lectures; he died in his house at Certaldo on December 21, 1375. See\r\nCochin, in _Revue des Deux Mondes_, July 15, 1888.\r\n\r\n[480] This meeting, concerning which numerous discussions have taken\r\nplace, seems to have most probably happened. \"I wol,\" says the clerk of\r\nOxford in the \"Canterbury Tales,\"\r\n\r\n    I wol yow telle a tale which that I\r\n    Lerned at Padowe of a worthy clerk ...\r\n    He is now deed and nayled in his cheste ...\r\n    Fraunceys Petrark, the laureat poet.\r\n\r\nSuch a circumstantial reference is of a most unusual sort; in most\r\ncases, following the example of his contemporaries, Chaucer simply says\r\nthat he imitates \"a book,\" or sometimes he refers to his models by a\r\nwrong or fancy name, such being the case with Boccaccio, whom he calls\r\n\"Lollius,\" a name which, however, does duty also with him, at another\r\nplace, for Petrarch. But on this occasion it seems as if the poet meant\r\nto preserve the memory of personal intercourse. We know besides that at\r\nthat date Chaucer was not without notoriety as a poet on the Continent\r\n(Des Champs' praise is a proof of it), and that at the time when he came\r\nto Italy Petrarch was at Arqua, near Padua, where he was precisely busy\r\nwith his Latin translation of Boccaccio's story of Griselda.\r\n\r\n[481] \"The Othe of the Comptroler of the Customes,\" in Thynne's\r\n\"Animadversions,\" Chaucer Society, 1875, p. 131.\r\n\r\n[482] None in the handwriting of Chaucer have been discovered as yet;\r\nbut some are to be seen drawn, as he was allowed to have them later, by\r\nanother's hand, under his own responsibility: \"per visum et testimonium\r\nGalfridi Chaucer.\"\r\n\r\n[483] The lease is dated May 10, 1374; Furnivall, \"Trial Forewords,\" p.\r\n1.

The \"Lyf of\r\nSeinte Cecile\" was transferred by Chaucer to his \"Canterbury Tales,\"\r\nwhere it became the tale of the second nun. The good women of the\r\n\"Legend\" are all of them love's martyrs: Dido, Ariadne, Thisbe, &c.; it\r\nwas Chaucer's first attempt to write a collection of stories with a\r\nPrologue. In the Prologue Venus and Cupid reproach him with having\r\ncomposed poems where women and love do not appear in a favourable light,\r\nsuch as \"Troilus\" and the translation of the \"Roman de la Rose,\" which\r\n\"is an heresye ageyns my lawe.\" He wrote his \"Legend\" to make amends.\r\n\r\n[487] \"Parlement of Foules,\" ll. 272, 225, \"Complete Works,\" vol. i.\r\n\r\n[488] \"Hous of Fame,\" l. 133 _ibid._, vol. iii.\r\n\r\n[489] \"Hous of Fame,\" l. 518.\r\n\r\n[490] \"Complete Works, \"vol. i. p. 365.

A number of ballads in all countries\r\nwere dedicated to Griselda; the popularity of an English one is shown by\r\nthe fact of other ballads being \"to the tune of Patient Grissel.\" One of\r\nMiss Edgeworth's novels has for its title and subject: \"The Modern\r\nGriselda.\"\r\n\r\n[543] One in French was performed at Paris in 1395 (\"Estoire de\r\nGriselidis ... par personnages,\" MS. Fr. 2203 in the National Library,\r\nParis), and was printed at the Renaissance, by Bonfons, ab. 1550: \"Le\r\nMystere de Griselidis\"; one in German was written by Hans Sachs in 1550.\r\nIn Italy it was the subject of an opera by Apostolo Zeno, 1620. In\r\nEngland, Henslowe, on the 15th of December, 1599, lends three pounds to\r\nDekker, Chettle and Haughton for their \"Pleasant comodie of Patient\r\nGrissil,\" printed in 1603, reprinted by the Shakespeare Society, 1841.\r\nThe English authors drew several hints from the French play, but theirs\r\nis the best written on the subject (parts of Julia, the witty sister of\r\nthe Marquis, of Laureo, the poor student, brother of Griselda, as proud\r\nas she is humble, &c.).\r\n\r\n[544] Lady Bradshaigh to Richardson, January 11, 1749. \"Correspondence\r\nof Samuel Richardson,\" ed.

Around Chaucer was a whole\r\nswarm of poets; he towers above them as an oak towers above a coppice;\r\nbut the oak is not isolated like the great trees that are sometimes seen\r\nbeneath the sun, alone in the midst of an open country. Chaucer is\r\nwithout peer but not without companions; and, among those companions,\r\none at least deserves to be ranked very near him.\r\n\r\nHe has companions of all kinds, nearly as diverse as those with whom he\r\nhad associated on the road to Canterbury. Some are continuators of the\r\nold style, and others are reformers; some there are, filled with the\r\ndreamy spirit of the Anglo-Saxons; there are others who care little for\r\ndreams and theories, who are of the world, and will not leave the earth;\r\nsome who sing, others who hum, others who talk. Certain poems are like\r\nclarions, and celebrate the battle of Crecy, of which Chaucer had not\r\nspoken; others resemble lovers' serenades; others a dirge for the dead.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nThe old styles are continued; the itinerant poets, jugglers, and\r\nminstrels have not disappeared; on the contrary, they are more numerous\r\nthan ever. \"Merry England\" favours them; they continue to play, as\r\nunder the first Angevins,[568] a very considerable and multiple part,\r\nwhich it is difficult to estimate. Those people, with their vast memory,\r\nare like perambulating libraries; they instruct, they amuse, they edify.\r\nPassing from county to county, hawking news, composing satirical songs,\r\nthey fill also the place of a daily gazette; they represent public\r\nopinion, sometimes create it, and often distort it; they are living\r\nnewspapers; they furnish their auditors with information about the\r\nmisdeeds of the Government, which, from time to time, seizes the most\r\ntalkative, and imprisons them to keep them silent. The king has\r\nminstrels in his service; they are great personages in their way,\r\npensioned by the prince and despising the others. The nobles also keep\r\nsome in their pay, which does not prevent their welcoming those who\r\npass; they feast them when they have sung well, and give them furred\r\nrobes and money.[569]\r\n\r\nThey continue to prosper in the following century. We see at that time\r\nthe king of England's minstrels, people clever and of good instruction,\r\nprotesting against the increasing audacity of sham minstrels, whose\r\nignorance casts discredit on the profession. \"Uncultured peasants,\" says\r\nthe king in a vengeful statute, \"and workmen of different kinds in our\r\nkingdom of England ... have given themselves out to be our own\r\nminstrels.\"[570] Without any experience or understanding of the art,\r\nthey go from place to place on festival days, and gather all the money\r\nthat should have enriched the true artists, those who really devote\r\nthemselves to their profession and ply no manual craft. Vain efforts;\r\ndecline was imminent; minstrels were not to recover their former\r\nstanding. The Renaissance and the Reformation came; and, owing to the\r\nprinting-press, gay scavoir found other means of spreading through the\r\ncountry. In the sixteenth century, it is true, minstrels still abound,\r\nbut they are held in contempt; right-minded people, like Philip Stubbes,\r\nhave no terms strong enough to qualify \"suche drunken sockets and bawdye\r\nparasits as range the cuntreyes, ryming and singing of uncleane,\r\ncorrupt, and filthie songes in tavernes, ale-houses, innes, and other\r\npublique assemblies.... Every towne, citie, and countrey is full of\r\nthese minstrelles to pype up a dance to the devill; but of dyvines, so\r\nfew there be as they maye hardly be seene.\"[571]\r\n\r\nBefore this awful time comes for them, however, the minstrels thrive\r\nunder the last Plantagenets. Their bill is a varied one, and includes\r\nthe best and the worst; they sometimes recite the \"Troilus\" of\r\nChaucer,[572] and sometimes the ancient romances of chivalry, altered,\r\nspoiled, shorn of all their poetry. Chaucer had ridiculed these versions\r\nof the old heroic stories, written in tripping verses, but in vain.\r\nThroughout his life, after as well as before \"Sir Thopas,\" he could\r\nwonder and laugh at the success of stories, composed in the very style\r\nof his own burlesque poem, about heroes who, being all peerless, are\r\nnecessarily all alike: one is \"stalworthe and wyghte,\" another \"hardy\r\nand wyght,\" a third also \"hardy and wyght\"; and the fourth, fifth, and\r\nhundredth are equally brave and invincible. They are called Isumbras,\r\nEglamour, Degrevant[573]; but they differ in their names and in nothing\r\nmore. The booksellers of the Renaissance who printed their histories\r\ncould make the same woodcut on the cover serve for all their portraits.\r\nBy merely altering the name beneath, they changed all there was to\r\nchange; one and the same block did duty in turn for Romulus or Robert\r\nthe Devil.[574] Specimens of this facile art swarm indefinitely; they\r\nare scattered over the country, penetrate into hamlets, find their way\r\ninto cottages, and make the people acquainted with the doughty deeds of\r\nEglamour and Roland. We now find ourselves really in the copse.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the copse are trees of finer growth. Some among the\r\npoets, while conforming to the old style, improve upon their models as\r\nthey proceed; they add an original note of their own, and on that\r\naccount deserve to be listened to. Far above those empty, tripping\r\nmetrical stories, and superior even to \"Morte Arthure\" and to \"William\r\nof Palerne,\"[575] written in English verse at the time of Chaucer, ranks\r\n\"Sir Gawayne and the Green Knight,\"[576] being incomparably the best\r\nspecimen of the style. Instead of puppets with jerky movements, and\r\nwooden joints that we hear crack, the English poet shows in this work\r\nreal men and women, with supple limbs and red lips; elegant, graceful,\r\nand charming to behold. These knights and ladies in their well-fitting\r\narmour or their tight dresses, whom we see stretched in churches on\r\ntheir fourteenth-century tombs, have come back to life once more; and\r\nnow they move, they gaze on each other, they love again.\r\n\r\nOn Christmas day, in presence of Arthur and his whole Court, Sir Gawayne\r\ncuts off the head of the Green Knight. This giant knight is doubtless an\r\nenchanter, for he stoops, picks up his head, and, remounting his horse,\r\nbids Sir Gawayne meet him a year hence at the Green Chapel, where he\r\nwill give him blow for blow.\r\n\r\nThe year passes. Gawayne leaves the Court with his horse \"Gringolet,\"\r\nand without quitting England, rides through unknown lands, having no\r\none to speak to save God. He reaches the gate of a splendid castle, and\r\nis welcomed by a knight of ordinary stature, under whose present\r\nappearance he does not recognise his adversary the giant. Three days are\r\nleft before the date of the tryst; they are spent in amusements. The\r\nknight goes daily to hunt; he agrees to give all his game to his guest,\r\nwho remains at home with the lady of the castle, the most beautiful\r\nwoman ever seen, on condition that Gawayne, in his turn, will give him\r\nwhat he has taken during his absence. Every night they gaily sup in the\r\nhall; a bright light burns on the walls, the servants set up wax\r\ntorches, and serve at table. The meal is cheered by music and \"caroles\r\nnewe,\"[577] jests, and the laughter of ladies.[578] At three o'clock\r\neach morning the lord of the castle rises, hears mass, and goes\r\na-hunting. Gawayne is awakened from sleep by his hostess; she enters his\r\nroom, with easy and graceful movements, dressed in a \"mery mantyle\" and\r\nfurred gown, trailing on the floor, but very low in the neck:\r\n\r\n    Hir breste bare bifore, and bihinde eke.\r\n\r\nShe goes to the window, opens it, and says, \"with hir riche wordes\":\r\n\r\n    A! mon, hou may thou sleep,\r\n    This morning is so clere![579]\r\n\r\nShe seats herself, and refuses to go. Gawayne is assailed by terrible\r\ntemptations. The thought of the Green Chapel, fortunately, helps him to\r\novercome them, and the first, second, and third night his fair friend\r\nfinds him equally coy. She kisses him once, twice, thrice, and jeers at\r\nhim for forgetting each day what she had taught him on the previous one,\r\nnamely, to kiss. When the hunter returns in the evening, Gawayne gives\r\nhim the kisses he has received in exchange for the spoils of the chase:\r\na buck, a boar, and a fox. He had, however, accepted besides a\r\nmarvellous belt, which protected the wearer from all danger, but he says\r\nnothing about this, and puts it on: \"Aux grands coeurs donnez quelques\r\nfaiblesses,\" our author obviously thinks, with Boileau.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth day Gawayne starts with a guide, and reaches the Green\r\nChapel; the Green Giant is there, ready to give him back the blow\r\nreceived a year before. Gawayne stoops his head under the dreadful axe,\r\nand just as it falls cannot help bending his shoulders a little. You are\r\nnot that Gawayne, says the giant, held in such high esteem. At this,\r\nArthur's knight straightens himself; the giant lifts his axe again and\r\nstrikes, but only inflicts a slight wound. All is now explained: for the\r\nkisses Gawayne should have received mortal blows, but he gave them back;\r\nhe kept the belt, however, and this is why he will bear through life a\r\nscar on his neck. Vexed, he throws away the belt, but the giant returns\r\nit to him, and consoles him by admitting that the trial was a superhuman\r\none, that he himself is Bernlak de Haut-Desert, and that his guest has\r\nbeen the sport of \"Morgan the fairy,\" the companion of his hostess:\r\n\r\n    Thurgh myght of Morgne la Faye that in my hous lenges (dwells).\r\n\r\nGawayne declares that should he ever be tempted by pride, he need only\r\nlook at the belt, and the temptation will vanish. He rejoins Arthur and\r\nhis peers, and tells his adventures, which afford food both for laughter\r\nand for admiration.\r\n\r\nThe poem is anonymous. The same manuscript contains another, on a\r\ntotally different subject, which seems to be by the same author. This\r\npoem has been called \"The Pearl;\"[580] it is a song of mourning. It must\r\nhave been written some time after the sad event which it records, when\r\nthe bitterness of sorrow had softened. The landscape is bathed in\r\nsunlight, the hues are wonderfully bright. The poet has lost his\r\ndaughter, his pearl, who is dead; his pearl has fallen in the grass, and\r\nhe has been unable to find it; he cannot tear himself away from the spot\r\nwhere she had been. He entered in that arbour green; it was August, that\r\nsunny season, when the corn has just fallen under the sickle; there the\r\npearl had \"trendeled doun\" among the glittering, richly-coloured plants,\r\ngilly-flowers, gromwell seed, and peonies, splendid in their hues,\r\nsweeter in their smell.[581] He sees a forest, rocks that glisten in\r\nthe sun, banks of crystal; birds sing in the branches, and neither\r\ncistern nor guitar ever made sweeter music. The sound of waters, too, is\r\nheard; a brook glides over pebbles shining like the stars in a winter's\r\nnight, at the hour when the weary sleep.[582]\r\n\r\nSo great is the beauty of the place that the father's grief is soothed,\r\nand he has a marvellous vision. On the opposite side of the stream he\r\nsees a maiden clothed in white; and as he gazes he suddenly recognises\r\nher: O pearl art thou in sooth my pearl, so mourned and wept for through\r\nso many nights? Touching and consoling is the answer: Thou hast lost no\r\npearl, and never hadst one; that thou lost was but a rose, that flowered\r\nand faded; now only has the rose become a pearl for ever.[583] The\r\nfather follows his child to where a glimpse can be caught of the\r\nCelestial City, with its flowers and jewels, the mystic lamb, and the\r\nprocession of the elect; it seems as if the poet were describing\r\nbeforehand, figure by figure, Van Eyck's painting at St. Bavon of Ghent.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nAn immense copse surrounds the oak. About Chaucer swarm innumerable\r\nminstrels, anonymous poets, rhyming clerks, knightly ballad makers.[584]\r\nThe fragile works of these rhyming multitudes are for the most part\r\nlost, yet great quantities of them still exist. They are composed by\r\neverybody, and written in the three languages used by the English; some\r\nbeing in French, some in English, some in Latin.\r\n\r\nThe Plantagenets were an art-loving race. Edward III. never thought of\r\ncost when it came to painting and gilding the walls of St. Stephen's\r\nChapel; Richard II. disliked a want of conformity in architectural\r\nstyles, and, having the conscience of an artist, gave an example of a\r\nrare sort in the Middle Ages, for he continued Westminster Abbey in the\r\nstyle of Henry III. Members of the royal family were known to write\r\nverses. The hero of Poictiers inserted in his will a piece of poetry in\r\nFrench, requesting that the lines should be graven on his tomb, where\r\nthey can still be read in Canterbury Cathedral: \"Such as thou wast, so\r\nwas I; of death I never thought so long as I lived. On earth I enjoyed\r\nample wealth, and I used it with great splendour, land, houses, and\r\ntreasure, cloth, horses, silver and gold; but now I am poor and bereft,\r\nI lie under earth, my great beauty is all gone.... And were you to see\r\nme now, I do not think you would believe that ever I was a man.\"[585]\r\n\r\nThe nobles followed suit; they put their passions into verse; but all\r\nhad not sufficient skill for such delicate pastimes. Many contented\r\nthemselves with copying some of those ready-made ballads, of which\r\nprofessional poets supplied ready-made collections; just as sermons were\r\nwritten for the benefit of obtuse parish priests, under the significant\r\ntitle of \"Dormi Secure\"[586] (Sleep in peace, tomorrow's sermon is\r\nready). We find also in English manuscripts rubrics like the following:\r\n\"Loo here begynnethe a Balade whiche that Lydegate wrote at the request\r\nof a squyer yt served in Love's court.\"[587] In their most elegant\r\nlanguage, with all the studied refinement of the flowery style, the\r\npoets, writing to order, amplified, embellished, and spoilt: \"ce mot, le\r\nmot des dieux et des hommes: je t'aime!\" We are not even in the copse\r\nnow, and we must stoop close to earth in order to see these blossoms of\r\na day.\r\n\r\nAmong men of the people, and plain citizens, as well as at Court, the\r\ntaste for ballads and songs imported from France became general in the\r\nfourteenth century. In the streets of London, mere craftsmen could be\r\nheard singing French burdens: for in spite of the progress of the\r\nnational tongue, French was not yet entirely superseded in Great\r\nBritain. Langland in his Visions has London workmen who sing: \"Dieu vous\r\nsauve dame Emma.\"[588] Chaucer's good parson bears witness to the\r\npopularity of another song, and declares in the course of his sermon:\r\n\"Wel may that man that no good werke ne dooth, singe thilke newe Frenshe\r\nsong: \"J'ay tout perdu mon temps et mon labour.\"[589]\r\n\r\nIn imitation of what was done in the northern provinces of France, a\r\n_Pui_ had been founded in London, that is an association established for\r\nthe purpose of encouraging the art of the _chanson_, which awarded\r\nprizes to the authors of the best verses and the best music.[590] In the\r\nfourteenth century the Pui of London was at the height of its\r\nprosperity; it included both foreign and English merchants. It had been\r\ninstituted so that \"jolity, peace, courtesy, gentleness, debonairity,\r\nand love without end might be maintained, all good promoted, and evil\r\nprevented.\" These merchants of divers countries evidently agreed in\r\nthinking that music softens the manners, and tried to extinguish their\r\nquarrels by songs. At the head of the Pui was a \"prince\" surrounded by\r\ntwelve \"compaignouns,\" elected by the brotherhood, whose mission\r\nincluded the duty of pacifying the squabblers. Each year a new prince\r\nwas chosen and solemnly enthroned. On the appointed day \"the old prince\r\nand his companions must go from one end of the hall to the other,\r\nsinging; the old prince will bear on his head the crown of the Pui, and\r\nhave in his hand a gilt cup full of wine. And when they shall have gone\r\nall round, the old prince must give the one they have elected to drink,\r\nand also give him the crown, and that one shall be prince.\"\r\n\r\nTo pass judgment on _chansons_ is no trifle, and the deed is surrounded\r\nby every precaution befitting so important a sentence. The decision\r\nrests with the old prince and the new, assisted by about fifteen \"of the\r\nmost knowing among the companions,\" who are all obliged to take a solemn\r\noath: \"They must find which is the best song, to the best of their\r\ncapacity, under oath that they will not fail for love, for hate, for\r\nfavour, for promise, for neighbourhood, for lineage, for any tie old or\r\nnew, or for any reason whatsoever.\" Moreover, two or three judges shall\r\nbe appointed \"who are skilled in singing and music,\" to examine the tune\r\nof the song: \"For unless it be accompanied by music, a written text\r\ncannot be called a _chanson_, neither can a _chanson royale_ be crowned\r\nunless it be accompanied with the sweetness of melodious singing.\" The\r\nwinner is to receive the crown, and his composition, copied and fairly\r\nwritten out, will be posted up in the hall, under the prince's coat of\r\narms: \"The prince shall cause to be fastened under his coat of arms the\r\nsong crowned on the day he was chosen to be the new prince, clearly\r\nwritten, and correctly, without fault.\"\r\n\r\nAt one time the Pui society was nearly ruined, owing to the expense\r\nincurred for decking the hall. In future it will be more moderate: \"It\r\nis agreed henceforth that part of the hall where the feast of the Pui\r\nis held, be not hung with silk or cloth of gold, neither shall the hall\r\nitself be draped, but only fairly garnished with green boughs, the floor\r\nstrewn with rushes, benches prepared, as befits such a feast royal; only\r\nthe seat for the singers who are to sing the _chansons royales_ shall be\r\ncovered with cloth of gold.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the competition, all dine together. Here is the bill of fare for\r\nthe feast: \"And the bill of fare is thus ordained; be all the companions\r\nliberally served, the poorest as well as the richest, after this\r\nfashion, to wit, that to them be served good bread, good ale and good\r\nwine, and then potage and a course of strong meat, and after that a\r\ndouble roast in a dish, and cheese, and nothing else.\" Women were not\r\nadmitted to these gatherings, and so that slanderers might not say it\r\nwas for fear of quarrels, or worse, we are told by the society itself\r\nthat it was to teach the members to \"honour, cherish, and praise them as\r\nmuch in their absence as in their presence.\"\r\n\r\nNo feast was complete in the Middle Ages without a procession or\r\nprogress through the streets; the amusement was thus shared by the\r\npeople. The members of the Pui did not fail in this: \"As soon as they\r\nshall have given the crown to the best singer, they shall mount their\r\nhorses and ride through the town, and then accompany their new prince to\r\nhis hostel, and there all get down, and dance before departing; and\r\ndrink once, and return each to his hostel.\" With its songs and music,\r\nits kind purpose, its crowns and green branches, this association seems\r\nlike a peaceful and verdant corner of Arcadia in the midst of London\r\nCity, peaceful and merry in spite of mercantile jealousies and\r\ninternational hatreds.\r\n\r\nThis oasis is all the more charming to the sight because it is only an\r\noasis. Such sentiments were too courteous to be very common. While our\r\nfriends of the Pui endeavour to cherish and praise women even in their\r\nabsence, other makers of songs follow another mediaeval tradition and\r\nsatirise them mercilessly. Triads were dedicated to them, which were\r\nnothing but slanderous litanies:\r\n\r\n    Herfor, and therfor, and therfor I came\r\n    And for to preysse this praty woman.\r\n    There wer three wylly, three wyly ther wer,\r\n    A fox, a fryyr and a woman.\r\n    Ther wer three angry, three angry ther wer:\r\n    A wasp a wesyll and a woman.[591]\r\n\r\nSo the litany continues, very different from the litany of the beauties\r\nof woman sung in the same period, perhaps by the same men. Friars,\r\nmonks, and fops who adopt absurd fashions, and wear hose so tight that\r\nthey cannot stoop for fear of bursting them,[592] are, with women, the\r\nsubjects of these satirical songs:\r\n\r\n    Preste, ne monke, ne yit chanoun,\r\n    Ne no man of religioun,\r\n    Gyfen hem so to devocioun\r\n          As done thes holy frers,\r\n    For summe gyven ham chyvalry,\r\n    Somme to riote and ribaudery;\r\n    Bot ffrers gyven ham to grete study\r\n          And to grete prayers.[593]\r\n\r\nAn account follows of doings, studies, and prayers, by no means\r\nedifying, and which recalls Chaucer rather than St. Francis.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nThe tone becomes more elevated; and then we have forest songs in honour\r\nof the outlaw Robin Hood.[594] The satire ceases to be simply mocking;\r\nthe singer's laughter no longer consoles him for abuses; he wants\r\nreforms; he chides and threatens. In his speech to the rebel peasants in\r\n1381, the priest John Ball takes from a popular song the burden that\r\ncomprises his whole theory:\r\n\r\n    Whan Adam dalf and Eve span,\r\n    Who was thanne the gentilman?[595]\r\n\r\nThe anonymous poet makes the dumb peasant speak, describe his woes, and\r\ndraw up a list of his complaints. By way of reply, anonymous clerks\r\ncompose songs, half English and half Latin, a favourite mixture at that\r\ntime, in which they express their horror of the rebels.[596] Others\r\nsound the praises of the English heroes of the Hundred Years' War.\r\n\r\nContrary to what might be supposed, the number of these last songs is\r\nnot great, and their inspiration not exalted. The war, as has been seen,\r\nwas a royal and not a national one; and it happened, moreover, that none\r\nof the famous poets of the time saw fit to celebrate Crecy and\r\nPoictiers. We have, therefore, nothing but rough sketches, akin to\r\npopular prints, barbarous in design, and coarse in colouring, but of\r\nstrong intent. Clerks, in their Latin, pursue France and Philip de\r\nValois, with opprobrious epithets:\r\n\r\n    Lynxea, viperea, vulpina, lupina, medea,\r\n    Callida, syrena, crudelis, acerba, superba.\r\n\r\nSuch is France according to them, and as to her king, his fate is\r\npredicted in the following pun:\r\n\r\n    O Philippus Valeys, Xerxes, Darius, Bituitus,\r\n    Te faciet _maleys_ Edwardus, aper polimitus.[597]\r\n\r\nTo which the French replied:\r\n\r\n    Puis passeront Gauloys le bras marin,\r\n    Le povre Anglet destruiront si par guerre,\r\n    Qu'adonc diront tuit passant ce chemin:\r\n    Ou temps jadis estoit ci Angleterre.[598]\r\n\r\nBut both countries have survived, for other quarrels, other troubles,\r\nand other glories.\r\n\r\nThe battles of Edward III. were also celebrated in a series of English\r\npoems, that have been preserved for us in a single manuscript, together\r\nwith the name of their author, Laurence Minot,[599] concerning whom\r\nnothing is known. In his rude verse, where alliteration is sometimes\r\ncombined with rhyme, both being very roughly handled, Minot follows\r\nEdward step by step, and extols his prowess with the best will, but in\r\nthe worst poetry. Grand subjects do not need magnifying; and when\r\nmagnified by unskilful artists they run the risk of recalling the Sir\r\nThopas example: this risk Edward incurs at the hands of Laurence Minot.\r\nOn the other hand absurd and useless expletives, \"suth to saine,\"\r\n\"i-wis,\" and especially \"both day and night\" continually help Minot to\r\neke out his rhymes; and the reader is sorely tempted uncourteously to\r\nagree with him when he exclaims:\r\n\r\n    Help me God, my wit es thin![600]\r\n\r\nBesides these war-songs, and at the same time, laments are heard, as in\r\nformer days, sad and desponding accents. Defeats have succeeded to\r\nvictories, and they contribute to raise doubts as to the validity of\r\nEdward's claims.[601] What if, after all, this ruinous war, the issue of\r\nwhich is uncertain, should turn out to be an unjust war as well? Verses\r\nare even composed on the subject of wrongs done to inoffensive people in\r\nFrance: \"Sanguis communitatis Franciae quae nihil ei nocebat quaeritur apud\r\nDeum.\"[602]\r\n\r\nIn war literature the Scots did not fare better than the French at the\r\nhands of their neighbours. At this time, and for long after, they were\r\nstill the foe, just as the Irish or French were. Following the example\r\ngiven by the latter, the Scots replied; several of their replies, being\r\nin English, belong to the literature of England. The most energetic is\r\nthe semi-historical romance called \"The Bruce\"; it is the best of the\r\npatriotic poems deriving their inspiration from the wars of the\r\nfourteenth century.\r\n\r\n\"The Bruce,\" composed about 1375 by John Barbour,[603] is divided into\r\ntwenty books; it is written in the dialect spoken in the south of\r\nScotland from Aberdeen to the frontier, the dialect employed later by\r\nJames I. and Sir David Lyndesay, who, like Barbour himself, called it\r\n\"inglis.\" Barbour's verse is octo-syllabic, forming rhymed couplets; it\r\nis the same as Chaucer's in his \"Hous of Fame.\"\r\n\r\nBarbour's intention is to write a true history; he thus expects, he\r\nsays, to give twofold pleasure: firstly because it is a history,\r\nsecondly because it is a true one. But where passion has a hold it is\r\nrare that Truth reigns paramount, and Barbour's feeling for his country\r\nis nothing short of passionate love; so much so that, when a legend is\r\nto the credit of Scotland, his critical sense entirely disappears, and\r\nmiracles become for him history. Thus with monotonous uniformity,\r\nthroughout his poem a handful of Scotchmen rout the English multitudes;\r\nthe highlanders perform prodigies, and the king still surpasses them in\r\nvalour; everything succeeds with him as in a fairy tale. This love of\r\nthe soil, of its rocks and its lochs, of its clans and their chieftains,\r\nbrings to mind the most illustrious of the literary descendants of\r\nBarbour, Walter Scott, who more than once borrowed from \"The Bruce\" the\r\nsubjects of his stories.[604]\r\n\r\nBesides the love of their land, the two compatriots have in common a\r\ntaste for picturesque anecdotes, and select them with a view of making\r\ntheir heroes popular; the sense of humour is not developed to an equal\r\ndegree, but it is of the same quality in both; and the same kind of\r\nhappy answers are enjoyed by the two. Barbour delights, and with good\r\nreason, in preserving the account of the fight in which the king,\r\ntraitorously attacked by three men while alone in the mountains, \"by a\r\nwode syde,\" smites them \"rigorously,\" and kills them all, and, when\r\ncongratulated on his return:\r\n\r\n                  \"Perfay,\" said he,\r\n    \"I slew bot ane forouten ma,\r\n    God and my hound has slane the twa.\"[605]\r\n\r\nBarbour likes to show the king, simple, patriarchal and valorous, stern\r\nto his foes, and gentle to the weak. He makes him halt his army in\r\nIreland, because the screams of a woman have been heard; it is a poor\r\nlaundress in the pangs of child-birth; the march is interrupted; a tent\r\nis spread, under which the poor creature is delivered in peace.[606]\r\n\r\nTo England's threats Barbour replies by challenges, and by his famous\r\napostrophe to liberty:\r\n\r\n    A! fredome is a noble thing!...[607]\r\n\r\nSome people, continues the good archdeacon, who cannot long keep to the\r\nlyric style, have compared marriage to bondage, but they are\r\nunexperienced men who know nothing about it; of course marriage is the\r\nworst state in which it is possible to live, the thing is beyond\r\ndiscussion; but in bondage one cannot live, one dies.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nA little above the copse another head rises; that of Chaucer's great\r\nfriend, John Gower. Unlike Chaucer in this, Gower hated and despised\r\ncommon people; when he allows them room in his works, the place assigned\r\nto them is an unenviable one. He is aristocratic and conservative by\r\nnature, so that he belongs to old England as much as to the new nation,\r\nand is the last in date of the recognisable representatives of Angevin\r\nBritain. Like the latter, Gower hesitates between several idioms; he is\r\nnot sure that English is the right one; he is tri-lingual, just as\r\nEngland had been; he writes long poems in Latin and English, and when he\r\naddresses himself to \"the universality of all men\" he uses French. He\r\nwrites French \"of Stratford,\" it is true; he knows it and confesses it;\r\nbut nothing shows better how truly he belongs to the England of times\r\ngone, the half-French England of former days: he excuses himself and\r\npersists. \"And if I stumble in my French, forgive me my mistakes;\r\nEnglish I am; and beg on this plea to be excused.\"[608]\r\n\r\nUnlike Chaucer, Gower was rich and of good family. His life was a long\r\none; born about 1325, he died in 1408. He was related to Sir Robert\r\nGower; he owned manors in the county of Kent and elsewhere; he was known\r\nto the king, and to the royal family, but undertook no public functions.\r\nTo him as we have seen, and to Strode, Chaucer dedicated his \"Troilus\":\r\n\r\n    O moral Gower, this book I directe\r\n    To thee and to the philosophical Strode,\r\n    To vouchen sauf, ther nede is, to corecte\r\n    Of your benignitees and zeles gode.[609]\r\n\r\nGower, in his turn, represents Venus addressing him as follows:\r\n\r\n    ... Grete well Chaucer whan ye mete\r\n    As my disciple and my poete,\r\n    For in the floures of his youth,\r\n    In sundry wise as he well couth,\r\n    Of dittees and of songes glade,\r\n    The which he for my sake made,\r\n    The lond fulfilled is over all.[610]\r\n\r\nGower was exceedingly pious. When old age came he retired with his wife\r\nto the priory of St. Mary Overy's (now St. Saviour), in that same suburb\r\nof Southwark where Chaucer preferred to frequent the \"Tabard,\" and spent\r\nhis last years there in devout observances. He became blind in 1400, and\r\ndied eight years after. He bequeathed to his wife three cups, two\r\nsalt-cellars, twelve silver spoons, all his beds and chests, and the\r\nincome of two manors; he left a number of pious legacies in order to\r\nhave lamps kept burning, and masses said for his soul. He gave the\r\nconvent two chasubles of silk, a large missal, a chalice, a martyrology\r\nhe had caused to be copied for this purpose, and begged that in exchange\r\nhe might be buried in the chapel of St. John the Baptist at St. Mary\r\nOvery's; which was done. His tomb, restored and repainted, still exists.\r\nHe is represented lying with his hands raised as if for prayer, his\r\nthick locks are bound by a fillet adorned with roses. The head of the\r\nplump, round-cheeked poet rests on his three principal works; he wears\r\nabout his neck a collar of interwoven SS, together with the swan, emblem\r\nof Henry IV. of England.[611]\r\n\r\nThe worthy man wrote immoderately, and in especial three great poems:\r\nthe \"Speculum Meditantis,\" in French; the \"Vox Clamantis,\" in Latin; the\r\n\"Confessio Amantis,\" in English. The first is lost; only an analysis of\r\nit remains, and it shows that Gower treated there of the vices and\r\nvirtues of his day.[612] The loss is not very great: Gower has told\r\npretty clearly elsewhere what he thought of the vices of his time, and,\r\neven had he not, it would have been easy to guess, for he was too\r\nright-minded a man not to have thought of them all the evil possible.\r\n\r\nSome French works of Gower have, however, come down to us; they are\r\nballads and madrigals, for imaginary Iris,[613] Court poems, imitations\r\nof Petrarch,[614] the light verses of a well-taught man. He promises\r\neternal service to his \"douce dame\"; his \"douce dame\" being no one in\r\nparticular. He writes for others, and they are welcome to draw from his\r\nworks: \"The love-songs thus far are composed specially for those who\r\nexpect love favours through marriage.... The ballads from here to the\r\nend of the book are common to all, according to the properties and\r\nconditions of lovers who are diversely wrought upon by fickle\r\nlove.\"[615] Here and there some fine similes are found in which figure\r\nthe chameleon, for instance, who was supposed to live on air alone, or\r\nthe hawk: \"Chameleon a proud creature is, that lives upon air without\r\nmore; thus may I say in similar fashion only through the love hopes\r\nwhich I entertain is my soul's life preserved.\"[616]\r\n\r\nHe excused himself, as we have seen, for the mistakes in his French\r\nworks, but neglected to do the same for his Latin poems: in which he was\r\nwrong. The principal one, the \"Vox Clamantis,\"[617] was suggested to him\r\nby the great rising of 1381, which had imperilled the Crown and the\r\nwhole social order. Gower, being a landowner in Kent, was in the best\r\nsituation fully to appreciate the danger.\r\n\r\nIn order to treat this terrible subject, Gower, who is not inventive,\r\nadopts the form of a dream, just as if it were a new \"Romaunt of the\r\nRose.\" It is springtime, and he falls asleep. Let us not mind it\r\novermuch, we shall soon do likewise; but our slumber will be a broken\r\none; in the midst of the droning of his sermon, Gower suddenly screams,\r\nroars, flies into a passion--\"Vox Clamantis!\" His hearers open an eye,\r\nwonder where they are, recognise Gower, and go off to sleep again.\r\n\r\nGower heaps up enormous and vague invectives; he fancies his style\r\nresembles that of the apostle in Patmos. Animals and monsters fight and\r\nscream; the common people have been turned into beasts, oxen, hogs,\r\ndogs, foxes, flies, frogs; all are hideous or dangerous. Cursing as he\r\ngoes along, Gower drives before him, with hissing distichs, the strange\r\nherd of his monsters, who \"dart sulphureous flames from the cavern of\r\ntheir mouth.\"[618]\r\n\r\nThese disasters are caused by the vices of the time, and Gower\r\nlengthily, patiently, complacently, draws up an interminable catalogue\r\nof them. A University education has taught him the importance of correct\r\ndivisions; he divides and subdivides according to the approved\r\nscholastic methods. Firstly, there are the vices of churchmen; these\r\nvices are of different kinds, as are ecclesiastics themselves; he\r\nre-divides and re-subdivides. Some parsons \"give Venus the tithes that\r\nbelong to God\"; others are the terror of hares: \"lepus visa pericla\r\nfugit,\" and hearken to no chime but the \"vociferations\" of the\r\nhounds[619]; others trade. Knights are too fond of women \"with golden\r\nlocks\"; peasants are slothful; merchants rapacious and dishonest; they\r\nmake \"false gems out of glass.\"[620] The king himself does not escape a\r\nlecture: let him be upright, pious, merciful, and choose his ministers\r\nwith care; let him beware of women: \"Thou art king, let one sole queen\r\nsuffice thee.\"[621]\r\n\r\nIn one particular, however, this sermon is a remarkable one. What\r\npredominates in these long tirades of poor verses is an intense feeling\r\nof horror and dismay; the quiet Gower, and the whole community to which\r\nhe belonged, have suddenly been brought face to face with something\r\nunusual and terrifying even for that period. The earth shook, and a gulf\r\nopened; hundreds of victims, an archbishop of Canterbury among them,\r\ndisappeared, and the abyss still yawns; the consternation is general,\r\nand no one knows what remedy to expect. Happily the two edges of the\r\nchasm have at last united; it has closed again, hiding in its depths a\r\nheaving sea of lava, the rumblings of which are still heard, and give\r\nwarning that it may burst forth at some future day. Gower, in the\r\nmeantime, scans his distichs.\r\n\r\nChaucer wrote in English, naturally, his sole reason being that it was\r\nthe language of the country. Gower, when he uses this idiom,[622] offers\r\nexplanations:\r\n\r\n    And for that fewe men endite\r\n    In oure Englishe, I thenke make,\r\n    A boke for Englondes sake.[623]\r\n\r\nHe has no idea to what extent this apology, so common a hundred years\r\nbefore, is now out of place after the \"Troilus\" of Chaucer. His English\r\nbook is a lengthy compilation, written at the request of the young King\r\nRichard,[624] wherein Gower seeks both to amuse and to instruct, giving\r\nas he does,\r\n\r\n    Somwhat of lust, somwhat of lore.\r\n\r\nIn his turn, and after Boccaccio, he invents a plot that will allow him\r\nto insert a whole series of tales and stories into one single work;\r\ncompositions of this sort being the fashion. Gower's collection contains\r\na hundred and twelve short stories, two or three of which are very well\r\ntold; one, the adventure of Florent, being, perhaps, related even better\r\nthan in Chaucer.[625] The rest resembles the Gower of the \"Vox\r\nClamantis.\"\r\n\r\nWhat will be the subject of this philosopher's talk? He will tell us of\r\na thing:\r\n\r\n    ... wherupon the world mote stonde,\r\n    And hath done sithen it began,\r\n    And shall while there is any man,\r\n    And that is love.[626]\r\n\r\nIn order to treat of this subject, and of many others, Boccaccio had\r\nconceived the idea of his gathering in the villa near Florence, and\r\nChaucer that of his pilgrimage. Moral Gower remains true to his\r\ncharacter, and imagines a confession. The lover seeks a priest of Venus,\r\na worthy and very learned old man, called Genius, who had already\r\nfigured as confessor in the \"Roman de la Rose\"[627]: \"Benedicite,\" says\r\nthe priest; \"Dominus,\" answers the lover; and a miniature shows the\r\nlover in a pink gown, kneeling in a meadow at the feet of Genius, a\r\ntonsured monk in frock and cowl.[628]\r\n\r\nWe find ourselves again among vices and virtues, classifications,\r\ndivisions, and subdivisions. Genius condemns the vices (those of his\r\ngoddess included, for he is a free speaking priest). He hates, above all\r\nthings, Lollardry, \"this new tapinage,\" and he commends the virtues; the\r\nstories come in by way of example: mind what your eyes do, witness\r\nActaeon; and your ears, witness the Sirens. He passes on to the seven\r\ndeadly sins which were apparently studied in the seminary where this\r\npriest of Venus learnt theology. After the deadly sins the mists and\r\nmarvels of the \"Secretum Secretorum\" fill the scene. At last the lover\r\nbegs for mercy; he writes Venus a letter: \"with the teres of min eye in\r\nstede of inke.\" Venus, who is a goddess, deciphers it, hastens to the\r\nspot, and scornfully laughs at this shivering lover, whom age and\r\nwrinkles have left a lover. Gower then decides to withdraw, and make, as\r\nhe says, \"beau retraite.\" In a last vision, the poor \"olde grisel\" gazes\r\nupon the series of famous loving couples, who give themselves up to the\r\ndelight of dancing, in a paradise, where one could scarcely have\r\nexpected to find them together: Tristan and Iseult, Paris and Helen,\r\nTroilus and Cressida, Samson and Dalila, David and Bathsheba, and\r\nSolomon the wise who has for himself alone a hundred or so of \"Jewes eke\r\nand Sarazines.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of the immense difference in their merit, the names of Chaucer\r\nand Gower were constantly coupled; James of Scotland, Skelton, Dunbar,\r\nalways mention them together; the \"Confessio\" was printed by Caxton;\r\nunder Elizabeth we find Gower on the stage; he figures in \"Pericles,\"\r\nand recites the prologue of this play, the plot of which is borrowed\r\nfrom his poem.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[568] See above, p. 162.\r\n\r\n[569] Against those practices Langland strongly protests in his\r\n\"Visions,\" text C. x. 133; xvi. 200.

Morley's\r\nedition (Carisbrooke Library, London, 1889, 8vo) is expurgated. Gower\r\nwrote in English some minor poems, in especial \"The Praise of Peace\" (in\r\nthe \"Political Poems,\" of Wright, Rolls). The \"Confessio\" is written in\r\nocto-syllabic couplets, with four accents. This poem should be compared\r\nwith French compilations of the same sort, and especially with the\r\n\"Castoiement d'un pere a son fils,\" thirteenth century, a series of\r\ntales in verse, told by the father to castigate and edify the son, text\r\nin Barbazan and Meon, \"Fabliaux,\" Paris, 1808, 4 vols. 8vo, vol. ii.\r\n\r\n[623] \"Confessio,\" Pauli's ed., p. 2.\r\n\r\n[624] Gower wrote two successive versions of his poem: the first about\r\n1384, the second about 1393. In this last one, having openly taken the\r\nside of the future Henry IV. (which was very bold of him), he suppressed\r\nall allusions to Richard. In the first version, instead of,\r\n\r\n    A boke for Englondes sake,\r\n\r\nhe had written:\r\n\r\n    A boke for King Richardes sake.\r\n\r\n[625] Vol. i. pp. 89 ff. In Chaucer, the story is told by the Wife of\r\nBath.\r\n\r\n[626] Beginning of Book i.\r\n\r\n[627] Already had been seen in the \"Roman\":\r\n\r\n    Comment Nature la deesse\r\n    A son pretre se confesse ...\r\n    \"Genius, dit-elle, beau pretre,\r\n    D'une folie que j'ai faite,\r\n    A vous m'en vuel faire confesse;\"\r\n\r\nand under pretence of confessing herself, she explains the various\r\nsystems of the universe at great length.\r\n\r\n[628] In Mrs. Egerton, 1991, fol. 7, in the British Museum, reproduced\r\nin my \"Piers Plowman,\" p. 11.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n_WILLIAM LANGLAND AND HIS VISIONS._\r\n\r\n\r\nGower's books were made out of books. Chaucer's friend carries us in\r\nimagination to the paradise of Eros, or to a Patmos of his own\r\ninvention, from whence he foretells the end of the world; but whatever\r\nhe does or says we are always perfectly aware of where we are: we are in\r\nhis library.\r\n\r\nIt is quite different with another poet of this period, a mysterious and\r\nintangible personage, whose very name is doubtful, whose writings had\r\ngreat influence, and that no one appears to have seen, concerning whom\r\nwe possess no contemporaneous information. Like Gower, strong ties bind\r\nhim to the past; but Gower is linked to Angevin England, and William\r\nLangland, if such be really his name, to the remote England of the\r\nSaxons and Scandinavians. His books are not made out of books; they are\r\nmade of real life, of things seen, of dreams dreamt, of feelings\r\nactually experienced. He is the exact opposite of Gower, he completes\r\nChaucer himself. When the \"Canterbury Tales\" are read, it seems as\r\nthough all England were described in them; when the Visions of Langland\r\nare opened, it is seen that Chaucer had not said everything. Langland\r\nis without comparison the greatest poet after Chaucer in the mediaeval\r\nliterature of England.[629]\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nHis Visions have been preserved for us in a considerable number of\r\nmanuscripts. They differ greatly among each other; Langland appears to\r\nhave absorbed himself in his work, continually remodelling and adding to\r\nit. No poem has been more truly lived than this one; it was the author's\r\nshelter, his real house, his real church; he always came back there to\r\npray, to tell his sorrows--to live in it. Hence strange incoherencies,\r\nand at the same time many unexpected lights. The spirit by which\r\nLangland is animated is the spirit of the Middle Ages, powerful,\r\ndesultory, limitless. A classic author makes a plan, establishes noble\r\nproportions, conceives a definite work, and completes it; the poet of\r\nthe Middle Ages, if he makes a plan, rarely keeps to it; he alters it as\r\nhe goes along, adding a porch, a wing, a chapel to his edifice: a\r\ncathedral in mediaeval times was never finished. Some authors, it is\r\ntrue, were already touched by classic influence, and had an idea of\r\nmeasure; such was the case with Chaucer, but not with Langland; anything\r\nand everything finds place in his work. By collecting the more\r\ncharacteristic notes scattered in his poem, sketch-books full of\r\nstriking examples might be formed, illustrative of English life in the\r\nfourteenth century, to compare with Chaucer's, of the political and\r\nreligious history of the nation, and also of the biography of the\r\nauthor.\r\n\r\nAllusions to events of the day which abound in the poem enable us to\r\ndate it. Three principal versions exist,[630] without counting several\r\nintermediate remodellings; the first contains twelve cantos or _passus_,\r\nthe second twenty, the third twenty-three; their probable dates are\r\n1362-3, 1376-7, and 1398-9.[631]\r\n\r\nThe numerous allusions to himself made by the author, principally in the\r\nlast text of his poem, when, according to the wont of old men, he chose\r\nto tell the tale of his past life, allow us to form an idea of what his\r\nmaterial as well as moral biography must have been. He was probably born\r\nin 1331 or 1332, at Cleobury Mortimer, as it seems, in the county of\r\nShrewsbury, not far from the border of Wales. He was (I think) of low\r\nextraction, and appears to have escaped bondage owing to the help of\r\npatrons who were pleased by his ready intelligence. From childhood he\r\nwas used to peasants and poor folk; he describes their habits as one\r\nfamiliarised with them, and their cottages as one who knows them well.\r\nHis life oscillated chiefly between two localities, Malvern and London.\r\nEven when he resides in the latter place, his thoughts turn to Malvern,\r\nto its hills and verdure; he imagines himself there; for tender ties,\r\nthose ties that bind men to mother earth, and which are only formed in\r\nchildhood, endear the place to him. A convent and a school formerly\r\nexisted at Malvern, and there in all likelihood Langland first studied.\r\n\r\nThe church where he came to pray still exists, built of red sandstone, a\r\nstructure of different epochs, where the Norman style and perpendicular\r\nGothic unite. Behind the village rise steep hills, covered with gorse,\r\nferns, heather, and moss. Their highest point quite at the end of the\r\nchain, towards Wales, is crowned by Roman earthworks. From thence can be\r\ndescried the vast plain where flows the Severn, crossed by streams\r\nbordered by rows of trees taking blue tints in the distance, spotted\r\nwith lights and shadows, as the clouds pass in the ever-varying sky.\r\nMeadows alternate with fields of waving grain; the square tower of\r\nWorcester rises to the left, and away to the east those mountains are\r\nseen that witnessed the feats of Arthur. This wide expanse was later to\r\ngive the poet his idea of the world's plain, \"a fair feld ful of folke,\"\r\nwhere he will assemble all humanity, as in a Valley of Jehoshaphat. He\r\nenjoys wandering in this \"wilde wildernesse,\" attracted by \"the layes\r\nthe levely foules made.\"\r\n\r\nFrom childhood imagination predominates in him; his intellectual\r\ncuriosity and facility are very great. He is a vagabond by nature, both\r\nmentally and physically; he roams over the domains of science as he did\r\nover his beloved hills, at random, plunging into theology, logic, law,\r\nastronomy, \"an harde thynge\"; or losing himself in reveries, reading\r\nromances of chivalry, following Ymagynatyf, who never rests: \"Idel was I\r\nnevere.\" He studies the properties of animals, stones, and plants, a\r\nlittle from nature and a little from books; now he talks as Euphues will\r\ndo later, and his natural mythology will cause a smile; and now he\r\nspeaks as one country-bred, who has seen with his own eyes, like Burns,\r\na bird build her nest, and has patiently watched her do it. Sometimes\r\nthe animal is a living one, that leaps from bough to bough in the\r\nsunlight; at others, it is a strange beast, fit only to dwell among the\r\nstone foliage of a cathedral cornice.\r\n\r\nHe knows French and Latin; he has some tincture of the classics; he\r\nwould like to know everything:\r\n\r\n    Alle the sciences under sonne | and alle the sotyle craftes,\r\n    I wolde I knewe and couth | kyndely in myne herte![632]\r\n\r\nBut, in that as in other things, his will is not on a par with his\r\naspirations: this inadequacy was the cause of numberless\r\ndisappointments. Thou art, Clergye says most appropriately, one of those\r\nwho want to know but hate to study:\r\n\r\n    The wer lef to lerne | but loth for to stodie.[633]\r\n\r\nEven in early youth his mind seems to lack balance; being as yet a boy,\r\nhe is already a soul in trouble.\r\n\r\nHis dreams at this time were not all dark ones; radiant apparitions came\r\nto him. Thou art young and lusty, said one, and hast years many before\r\nthee to live and to love; look in this mirror, and see the wonders and\r\njoys of love. I shall follow thee, said another, till thou becomest a\r\nlord, and hast domains.[634] But one by one the lights faded around him;\r\nhis patrons died, and this was the end of his ambitions; for he was not\r\none of those men able by sheer strength of will to make up for outside\r\nhelp when that fails them. His will was diseased; an endless grief began\r\nfor him. Being dependent on his \"Clergye\" for a livelihood, he went to\r\nLondon, and tried to earn his daily bread by means of it, of \"that\r\nlabour\" which he had \"lerned best.\"[635]\r\n\r\nReligious life in the Middle Ages had not those well-defined and visible\r\nlandmarks to which we are accustomed. Nowadays one either is or is not\r\nof the Church; formerly, no such obvious divisions existed. Religious\r\nlife spread through society, like an immense river without dykes,\r\nswollen by innumerable affluents, whose subterranean penetrations\r\nimpregnated even the soil through which they did not actually flow. From\r\nthis arose numerous situations difficult to define, bordering at once on\r\nthe world and on the Church, a state of things with which there is no\r\nanalogy now, except in Rome itself, where the religious life of the\r\nMiddle Ages still partly continues.\r\n\r\nNumerous semi-religious and slightly remunerative functions were\r\naccessible to clerks, who were not, however, obliged to renounce the\r\nworld on that account. The great thing in the hour of death being to\r\nensure the salvation of the soul, men of fortune continued, and\r\nsometimes began, their good works at that hour. They endeavoured to win\r\nParadise by proxy; they left directions in their will that, by means of\r\nlawful hire, soldiers should be sent to battle with the infidel; and\r\nthey also founded what were called \"_chantries_.\" A sum of money was\r\nleft by them in order that masses, or the service for the dead, or both,\r\nshould be chanted for the repose of their souls.\r\n\r\nThe number of these chantries was countless; every arch in the aisles of\r\nthe cathedrals contained some, where the service for the dead was sung;\r\nsometimes separate edifices were built with this view. A priest\r\ncelebrated masses when the founder had asked for them; and clerks\r\nperformed the office of choristers, having, for the most part, simply\r\nreceived the tonsure, and not being necessarily in holy orders. It was,\r\nfor them all, a career, almost a trade; giving rise to discussions\r\nconcerning salaries, and even to actual strikes. These services derived\r\nthe name under which they commonly went from one of the words of the\r\nliturgy sung; they were called _Placebos_ and _Diriges_. The word\r\n\"dirge\" has passed into the English language, and is derived from the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nTo psalmody for money, to chant the same words from day to day and from\r\nyear to year, transforming into a mere mechanical toil the divine gift\r\nand duty of prayer, could not answer the ideal of life conceived by a\r\nproud and generous soul filled with vast thoughts. Langland, however,\r\nwas obliged to curb his mind to this work; _Placebo_ and _Dirige_ became\r\nhis _tools_:\r\n\r\n    The lomes that ich laboure with | and lyflode deserve.[636]\r\n\r\nLike many others whose will is diseased, he condemned the abuse and\r\nprofited by it. The fairies at his birth had promised riches, and he was\r\npoor; they had whispered of love, and an unsatisfactory marriage had\r\nclosed the door on love, and debarred him from preferment to the highest\r\necclesiastical ranks. Langland lives miserably with his wife Catherine\r\nand his daughter Nicolette, in a house in Cornhill, not far from St.\r\nPaul's, the cathedral of many chantries,[637] and not far from that\r\ntower of Aldgate, to which about this time that other poet, Chaucer,\r\ndirected his steps, he, too, solitary and lost in dreams.\r\n\r\nLangland has depicted himself at this period of his existence a great,\r\ngaunt figure, dressed in sombre garments with large folds, sad in a\r\ngrief without end, bewailing the protectors of his childhood and his\r\nlost illusions, seeing nothing but clouds on the horizon of his life. He\r\nbegins no new friendships; he forms ties with no one; he follows the\r\ncrowded streets of the city, elbowing lords, lawyers, and ladies of\r\nfashion; he greets no one. Men wearing furs and silver pendants, rich\r\ngarments and collars of gold, brush past him, and he knows them not.\r\nGold collars ought to be saluted, but he does not do it; he does not say\r\nto them: \"God loke yow Lordes!\" But then his air is so absent, so\r\nstrange, that instead of quarrelling with him people shrug their\r\nshoulders, and say: He is \"a fole\"; he is mad.[638] Mad! the word recurs\r\nagain and again under his pen, the idea presents itself incessantly to\r\nhis mind, under every shape, as though he were possessed by it: \"fole,\"\r\n\"frantyk,\" \"ydiote!\" He sees around him nothing but dismal spectres:\r\nAge, Penury, Disease.\r\n\r\nTo these material woes are added mental ones. In the darkness of this\r\nworld shines at least a distant ray, far off beyond the grave. But, at\r\ntimes, even this light wavers; clouds obscure and apparently extinguish\r\nit. Doubts assail the soul of the dreamer; theology ought to elucidate,\r\nbut, on the contrary, only darkens them:\r\n\r\n    The more I muse there-inne | the mistier it seemeth,\r\n    And the depper I devyne | the darker me it thinketh.[639]\r\n\r\nHow is it possible to reconcile the teachings of theology with our idea\r\nof justice? And certain thoughts constantly recur to the poet, and shake\r\nthe edifice of his faith; he drives them away, they reappear; he is\r\nbewitched by them and cannot exorcise these demons. Who had a more\r\nelevated mind than Aristotle, and who was wiser than Solomon? Still they\r\nare held by Holy-Church \"bothe ydampned!\" and on Good Friday, what do\r\nwe see? A felon is saved who had lived all his life in lies and thefts;\r\nhe was saved at once \"with-outen penaunce of purgatorie.\" Adam, Isaiah,\r\nand all the prophets remained \"many longe yeres\" with Lucifer, and--\r\n\r\n    A robbere was yraunceouned | rather than thei alle![640]\r\n\r\nHe wishes he had thought less, learnt less, \"conned\" fewer books, and\r\npreserved for himself the quiet, \"sad bileve\" of \"plowmen and\r\npastoures\"; happy men who can\r\n\r\n    Percen with a _pater noster_ | the paleys of hevene![641]\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these trials and sorrows, Langland had one refuge: his\r\nbook. His poem made up for those things which life had denied him. Why\r\nmake verses, why write, said Ymagynatyf to him; are there not \"bokes\r\nynowe?\"[3] But without his book, Langland could not have lived, like\r\nthose fathers whose existence is bound up in that of their child, and\r\nwho die if he dies. When he had finished it, and though his intention\r\nwas never to touch it again, for in it he announced his own death, he\r\nstill began it over again, once, twice; he worked at it all his life.\r\n\r\nWhat was the end of that life? No one knows. Some indications tend to\r\nshow that in his later years he left London, where he had led his\r\ntroubled life to return to the Western country.[642] There we should\r\nlike to think of him, soothed, healed, resigned, and watching that sun\r\ndecline in the west which he had seen rise, many years before, \"in a\r\nsomere seyson.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nIn this summer season, in the freshness of the morning, to the musical\r\nsound of waters, \"it sowned so murrie,\" the poet, lingering on the\r\nsummit of Malvern hills, falls asleep, and the first of his visions\r\nbegins. He contemplates\r\n\r\n    Al the welthe of this worlde | and the woo bothe;\r\n\r\nand, in an immense plain, a \"feld ful of folke,\" he notices the bustle\r\nand movements of mankind,\r\n\r\n    Of alle maner of men | the mene and the riche.\r\n\r\nMankind is represented by typical specimens of all sorts: knights,\r\nmonks, parsons, workmen singing French songs, cooks crying: Hot pies!\r\n\"Hote pyes, hote!\" pardoners, pilgrims, preachers, beggars, janglers who\r\nwill not work, japers and \"mynstralles\" that sell \"glee.\" They are, or\r\nnearly so, the same beings Chaucer assembled at the \"Tabard\" inn, on the\r\neve of his pilgrimage to Canterbury. This crowd has likewise a\r\npilgrimage to make, not, however, on the sunny high-road that leads from\r\nSouthwark to the shrine of St. Thomas. No, they journey through abstract\r\ncountries, and have to accomplish, some three hundred years before\r\nBunyan's Christian, their pilgrim's progress in search of Truth and of\r\nSupreme Good.\r\n\r\nA lady appears, who explains the landscape and the vision; she is\r\nHoly-Church. Yonder tower is the tower of Truth. This castle is the\r\n\"Castel of Care\" that contains \"Wronge.\" Holy-Church points out how\r\nmankind ought to live, and teaches kings and knights their duties with\r\nregard to Truth.\r\n\r\nHere comes Lady Meed, a lady of importance, whose friendship means\r\nperdition, yet without whom nothing can be done, and who plays an\r\nimmense part in the world. The monosyllable which designates her has a\r\nvague and extended signification; it means both reward and bribery.\r\nDisinterestedness, the virtue of noble minds, being rare in this world,\r\nscarcely anything is undertaken without hope of recompense, and what\r\nman, toiling solely with a view to recompense, is quite safe from\r\nbribery? So Lady Meed is there, beautiful, alluring, perplexing; to get\r\non without her is impossible, and yet it is hard to know what to do with\r\nher. She is about to marry \"Fals\"; the friends and witnesses have\r\narrived, the marriage deed is drawn up; the pair are to have the\r\n\"Erldome of Envye,\" and other territories that recall the worst regions\r\nof the celebrated map of the Tendre. Opposition is made to the marriage,\r\nand the whole wedding party starts for Westminster, where the cause is\r\nto be determined; friends, relations, bystanders; on foot, on horseback,\r\nand in carriages; a singular procession!\r\n\r\nThe king, notified of the coming of this _cortege_, publicly declares he\r\nwill deal justice to the knaves, and the procession melts away; most of\r\nthe friends disappear at a racing pace through the lanes of London. The\r\npoet hastens to lodge the greatest scoundrels with the people he hates,\r\nand has them received with open arms. \"Gyle\" is welcomed by the\r\nmerchants, who dress him as an apprentice, and make him wait on their\r\ncustomers. \"Lyer\" has at first hard work to find shelter; he hides in\r\nthe obscure holes of the alleys, \"lorkynge thorw lanes\"; no door opens,\r\nhis felonies are too notorious. At last, the pardoners \"hadden pite and\r\npullede hym to house\"; they washed him and clothed him and sent him to\r\nchurch on Sundays with bulls and seals appended, to sell \"pardons for\r\npans\" (pence). Then leeches send him letters to say that if he would\r\nassist them \"waters to loke,\" he should be well received; spicers have\r\nan interview with him; minstrels and messengers keep him \"half a yere\r\nand eleve dayes\"; friars dress him as a friar, and, with them, he forms\r\nthe friendliest ties of all.[643]\r\n\r\nLady Meed appears before the king's tribunal; she is beautiful, she\r\nlooks gentle, she produces a great effect; she is Phryne before her\r\njudges with the addition of a garment. The judges melt, they cheer her,\r\nand so do the clerks, the friars, and all those that approach her. She\r\nis so pretty! and so kind! Anything you will, she wills it too; no one\r\nfeels bashful in her presence; she is indeed so kind! A friar offers her\r\nthe boon of an absolution, which he will grant her \"himself\"; but she\r\nmust do good to the brotherhood: We have a window begun that will cost\r\nus dear; if you would pay for the stained glass of the gable, your name\r\nshould be engraved thereon, and to heaven would go your soul. Meed is\r\nwilling. The king appears and examines her; he decides to marry her, not\r\nto Fals, but to the knight Conscience. Meed is willing; she is always\r\nwilling.\r\n\r\nThe knight comes, refuses, and lays bare the ill-practices of Meed, who\r\ncorrupts all the orders of the kingdom, and has caused the death of\r\n\"yowre fadre\" (your father, King Edward II.). She would not be an\r\namiable spouse; she is as \"comune as the cart-wey.\" She connives with\r\nthe Pope in the presentation to benefices; she obtains bishoprics for\r\nfools, \"theighe they be lewed.\"\r\n\r\nMeed weeps, which is already a good answer; then, having recovered the\r\nuse of speech, she defends herself cleverly. The world would fall into a\r\ntorpor without Meed; knights would no longer care for kings; priests\r\nwould no longer say masses; minstrels would sing no more songs;\r\nmerchants would not trade; and even beggars would no longer beg.\r\n\r\nThe knight tartly replies: There are two kinds of Meed; we knew it;\r\nthere is reward, and there is bribery, but they are always confounded.\r\nAh! if Reason reigned in this world instead of Meed, the golden age\r\nwould return; no more wars; no more of these varieties of tribunals,\r\nwhere Justice herself gets confused. At this Meed becomes \"wroth as the\r\nwynde.\"[644]\r\n\r\nEnough, says the king; I can stand you no longer; you must both serve\r\nme:\r\n\r\n    \"Kisse hir,\" quod the kynge | \"Conscience, I hote (bid).\"\r\n    --\"Nay bi Criste!\"[645]\r\n\r\nthe knight answers, and the quarrel continues. They send for\r\nReason to decide it. Reason has his horses saddled; they have\r\ninterminable names, such as \"Suffre-til-I-see-my-time.\" Long before\r\nthe day of the Puritans, our visionary employs names equivalent\r\nto sentences; we meet, in his poem, with a little girl, called\r\nBehave-well-or-thy-mother-will-give-thee-a-whipping,[646] scarcely a\r\npractical name for everyday life; another personage, Evan the Welshman,\r\nrejoices in a name six lines long.\r\n\r\nReason arrives at Court; the dispute between Meed and Conscience is\r\ndropped and forgotten, for another one has arisen. \"Thanne come Pees\r\ninto Parlement;\" Peace presents a petition against Wrong, and\r\nenumerates his evil actions. He has led astray Rose and Margaret; he\r\nkeeps a troup of retainers who assist him in his misdeeds; he attacks\r\nfarms, and carries off the crops; he is so powerful that none dare stir\r\nor complain. These are not vain fancies; the Rolls of Parliament, the\r\nactual Parliament that was sitting at Westminster, contain numbers of\r\nsimilar petitions, where the real name of Wrong is given, and where the\r\nking endeavours to reply, as he does in the poem, according to the\r\ncounsels of Reason.\r\n\r\nReason makes a speech to the entire nation, assembled in that plain\r\nwhich is discovered from the heights of Malvern, and where we found\r\nourselves at the beginning of the Visions.\r\n\r\nThen a change of scene. These scene-shiftings are frequent, unexpected,\r\nand rapid as in an opera. \"Then, ...\" says the poet, without further\r\nexplanation: then the scene shifts; the plain has disappeared; a new\r\npersonage, Repentance, now listens to the Confession of the Deadly Sins.\r\nThis is one of the most striking passages of the poem; in spite of their\r\nabstract names, these sins are tangible realities; the author describes\r\ntheir shape and their costumes; some are bony, others are tun-bellied;\r\nsingular abstractions with warts on their noses! We were just now in\r\nParliament, with the victims of the powerful and the wicked; we now hear\r\nthe general confession of England in the time of the Plantagenets.[647]\r\n\r\nThat the conversion may be a lasting one, Truth must be sought after.\r\nPiers Plowman appears, a mystic personage, a variable emblem, that here\r\nsimply represents the man of \"good will,\" and elsewhere stands for\r\nChrist himself. He teaches the way; gates must be entered, castles\r\nencountered, and the Ten Commandments will be passed through. Above\r\nall, he teaches every one his present duties, his active and definite\r\nobligations; he protests against useless and unoccupied lives, against\r\nthose who have since been termed \"dilettante,\" for whom life is a sight,\r\nand who limit their function to being sight-seers, to amusing themselves\r\nand judging others. All those who live upon earth have actual practical\r\nduties, even you, lovely ladies:\r\n\r\n    And ye lovely ladyes | with youre longe fyngres.\r\n\r\nAll must defend, or till, or sow the field of life. The ploughing\r\ncommences, but it is soon apparent that some pretend to labour and\r\nlabour not; they are lazy or talkative, and sing songs. Piers succeeds\r\nin mastering them by the help of Hunger. Thanks to Hunger and Truth,\r\ndistant possibilities are seen of a reform, of a future Golden Age, an\r\nisland of England that shall be similar to the island of Utopia,\r\nimagined later by another Englishman.\r\n\r\nThe vision rises and fades away; another vision and another pilgrimage\r\ncommence, and occupy all the remainder of the poem, that is, from the\r\neleventh to the twenty-third passus (C. text). The poet endeavours to\r\njoin in their dwellings Dowel, Dobet, and Dobest; in other terms:\r\nGood-life, Better-life, and Best-life. All this part of the book is\r\nfilled with sermons, most of them energetic, eloquent, spirited, full of\r\nmasterly touches, leaving an ineffaceable impression on the memory and\r\nthe heart: sermon of Study on the Bible and on Arts and Letters; sermons\r\nof Clergye and of Ymagynatyf; dialogue between Hawkyn (active life) and\r\nPatience; sermons of Faith, Hope, and Charity. Several visions are\r\nintermingled with these sermons: visions of the arrival of Christ in\r\nJerusalem, and of the Passion; visions of hell attacked by Jesus, and\r\ndefended by Satan and Lucifer with guns, \"brasene gonnes,\" a then recent\r\ninvention, which appeared particularly diabolical. Milton's Satan, in\r\nspite of having had three hundred years in which to improve his tactics,\r\nwill find nothing better; his batteries are ranged in good order; a\r\nseraph stands behind each cannon with lighted match; at the first\r\ndischarge, angels and archangels fall to the ground:\r\n\r\n    By thousands, Angel on Archangel rolled.\r\n\r\nThey are not killed, but painfully suffer from a knowledge that they\r\nlook ridiculous: \"an indecent overthrow,\" they call it. The fiends,\r\nexhilarated by this sight, roar noisily, and it is hard indeed for us to\r\ntake a tragical view of the massacre.[648]\r\n\r\nIn the Visions, Christ, conqueror of hell, liberates the souls that\r\nawait his coming, and the poet awakes to the sounds of bells on Easter\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nThe poem ends amid doleful apparitions; now comes Antichrist, then Old\r\nAge, and Death. Years have fled, death draws near; only a short time\r\nremains to live; how employ it to the best advantage? (Dobet). Advise\r\nme, Nature! cries the poet. \"Love!\" replies Nature:\r\n\r\n    \"Lerne to love,\" quod Kynde | \"and leve of alle othre.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nChaucer, with his genius and his manifold qualities, his gaiety and his\r\ngracefulness, his faculty of observation and that apprehensiveness of\r\nmind which enables him to sympathise with the most diverse specimens of\r\nhumanity, has drawn an immortal picture of mediaeval England. In certain\r\nrespects, however, the description is incomplete, and one must borrow\r\nfrom Langland some finishing touches.\r\n\r\nWe owe to Chaucer's horror of vain abstractions the individuality of\r\neach one of his personages; all classes of society are represented in\r\nhis works; but the types which impersonate them are so clearly\r\ncharacterised, their singleness is so marked, that on seeing them we\r\nthink of them alone and of no one else. We are so absorbed in the\r\ncontemplation of this or that man that we think no more of the class,\r\nthe _ensemble_, the nation.\r\n\r\nThe active and actual passions of the multitude, the subterranean lavas\r\nwhich simmer beneath a brittle crust of good order and regular\r\nadministration, all the latent possibilities of volcanoes which this\r\ninward fire betokens, are, on the contrary, always present to the mind\r\nof the visionary; rumblings are heard, and they herald the earthquake.\r\nThe vehement and passionate England that produced the great rising of\r\n1381, and the heresy of Wyclif, that later on will give birth to the\r\nCavaliers and Puritans, is contained in essence in Langland's work; we\r\ndivine, we foresee her. Chaucer's book is, undoubtedly, not in\r\ncontradiction to that England, but it screens and allows her to be\r\nforgotten. In their anger Chaucer's people exchange blows on the\r\nhighway; Langland's crowds in their anger sack the palace of the Savoy,\r\nand take the Tower of London.\r\n\r\nLangland thus shows us what we find in none of his contemporaries:\r\ncrowds, groups, classes, living and individualised; the merchant class,\r\nthe religious world, the Commons of England. He is, above all, the only\r\nauthor who gives a sufficient and contemporaneous idea of that grand\r\nphenomenon, the power of Parliament. Chaucer who was himself a member of\r\nthat assembly, sends his franklin there; he mentions the fact, and\r\nnothing more; the part played by the franklin in that group, amid that\r\nconcourse of human beings, is not described. On the other hand, an\r\nadmirable picture represents him keeping open house, and ordering\r\ncapons, partridges, and \"poynant sauce\" in abundance. At home, his\r\npersonality stands out in relief; but yonder, at Westminster, the\r\nfranklin was doubtless lost in the crowd; and crowds had little interest\r\nfor Chaucer.\r\n\r\nIn two documents only does that power appear great and impressive as it\r\nreally was, and those documents are: the Rolls wherein are recorded the\r\nacts of Parliament, and the poem of William Langland. No one before him,\r\nnone of his contemporaries, had seen so clearly how the matter stood.\r\nThe whole organisation of the English State is summed up in a line of\r\nadmirable conciseness and energy, in which the poet shows the king\r\nsurrounded by his people:\r\n\r\n                     Knyghthod hym ladde,\r\n    Might of the comunes | made hym to regne.[649]\r\n\r\nThe power of the Commons is always present to the mind of Langland; he\r\nobserves the impossibility of doing without them. When the king is\r\ninclined to stretch his prerogative beyond measure, when he gives in his\r\nspeeches a foretaste of the theory of divine right, when he speaks as\r\ndid Richard II. a few years after, and the Stuarts three centuries\r\nlater, when he boasts of being the ruler of all, of being \"hed of lawe,\"\r\nwhile the Clergy and Commons are but members of the same, Langland stops\r\nhim, and through the mouth of Conscience, adds a menacing clause:\r\n\r\n    \"In condicioun,\" quod Conscience, | \"that thow konne defende\r\n    And rule thi rewme in resoun | right wel, and in treuth.\"[650]\r\n\r\nThe deposition of Richard, accused of having stated, nearly in the same\r\nterms, \"that he dictated from his lips the laws of his kingdom,\"[651]\r\nand the fall of the Stuarts, are contained, so to say, in these almost\r\nprophetic words.\r\n\r\nOn nearly all the questions which agitate men's minds in the fourteenth\r\ncentury, Langland agrees with the Commons, and, as we follow from year\r\nto year the Rolls of Parliament, petitions or decisions are found\r\ninspired by the same views as those Langland entertained; his work at\r\ntimes reads like a poetical commentary of the Rolls. Langland, as the\r\nCommons, is in favour of the old division of classes, of the continuance\r\nof bondage, and of the regulation of wages by the State; he feels\r\nnothing but hatred for Lombard and Jew bankers, for royal purveyors, and\r\nforestallers. In the same way as the Commons, he is in favour of peace\r\nwith France; his attention is concentrated on matters purely English;\r\ndistant wars fill him with anxiety. He would willingly have kept to the\r\npeace of Bretigny, he hopes the Crusades may not recommence. He is above\r\nall _insular_. Like the Commons he recognises the religious authority of\r\nthe Pope, but protests against the Pope's encroachments, and against the\r\ninterference of the sovereign-pontiff in temporal matters. The extension\r\nof the papal power in England appears to him excessive; he protests\r\nagainst appeals to the Court of Rome; he is of opinion that the wealth\r\nof the Church is hurtful to her; he shares the sentiments of the Commons\r\nof the Good Parliament towards what they do not hesitate to term the\r\nsinful town of Avignon: \"la peccherouse cite d'Avenon.\"[652] He is\r\nindignant with the bishops, masters, and doctors that allow themselves\r\nto become domesticated, and:\r\n\r\n    ... serven as servantz | lordes and ladyes,\r\n    And in stede of stuwardes | sytten and demen.[653]\r\n\r\nGoing down in this manner, step by step, Langland reaches the strange,\r\ngrimacing, unpardonable herd of liars, knaves, and cheats who traffic in\r\nholy things, absolve for money, sell heaven, deceive the simple, and\r\nappear as if they \"hadden leve to lye al here lyf after.\"[654] In this\r\nnethermost circle of his hell, where he scourges them with incessant\r\nraillery, the poet confines pell-mell all these glutted unbelievers.\r\nLike hardy parasitical plants, they have disjoined the tiles and stones\r\nof the sacred edifice, so that the wind steals in, and the rain\r\npenetrates: shameless pardoners they are, friars, pilgrims, hermits,\r\nwith nothing of the saint about them save the garb, whose example,\r\nunless a stop is put to it, will teach the world to despise clerical\r\ndress, those who wear it, and the religion, even, that tolerates and\r\nsupports them.\r\n\r\nAt this depth, and in the dim recesses where he casts the rays of his\r\nlantern, Langland spares none; his ferocious laugh is reverberated by\r\nthe walls, and the scared night-birds take to flight. His mirth is not\r\nthe mirth of Chaucer, itself less light than the mirth of France; not\r\nthe joyous peal of laughter which rang out on the Canterbury road,\r\nwelcoming the discourses of the exhibitor of relics, and the far from\r\ndisinterested sermons of the friar to sick Thomas. It is a woful and\r\nterrible laugh, harbinger of the final catastrophe and doom. What they\r\nhave heard in the plain of Malvern, the accursed ones will hear again in\r\nthe Valley of Jehoshaphat.\r\n\r\nThey have now no choice, but must come out of their holes; and they come\r\nforward into the light of day, hideous and grotesque, saturated with the\r\nmoisture of their dismal vaults; the sun blinds them, the fresh air\r\nmakes them giddy; they present a sorry figure. Unlike the pilgrims of\r\nCanterbury, they derive no benefit from the feelings of indulgence that\r\nsoftens our hearts on a gay April morn; they will learn to know the\r\ndifference between the laugh that pardons and the laugh that kills.\r\nLangland takes them up, lets them fall, and takes them up again; he\r\nnever wearies of this cruel sport; he presents them to us now\r\nseparately, and now collectively: packs of pilgrims, \"eremytes on an\r\nhep,\" pilgrims that run to St. James's in Spain, to Rome, to Rocamadour\r\nin Guyenne, who have paid visits to every saint. But have they ever\r\nsought for St. Truth? No, never! Will they ever know the real place\r\nwhere they might find St. James? Will they suspect that St. James should\r\n\r\n             be souht | ther poure syke lyggen (he)\r\n    In prisons and in poore cotes?[655]\r\n\r\nThey seek St. James in Spain, and St. James is at their gates; they\r\nelbow him each day, and they recognise him not.\r\n\r\nWhat sight can comfort us for these sad things? That of the poor and\r\ndisinterested man, of the honest and courageous labourer. Langland here\r\nshows himself truly original: the guide he has chosen differs as much\r\nfrom the Virgil of Dante as from the Lover that Guillaume de Lorris\r\nfollows through the paths of the Garden of the Rose. The English\r\nvisionary is led by Piers Plowman; Piers is the mainspring of the State;\r\nhe realises that ideal of disinterestedness, conscience, reason, which\r\nfills the soul of our poet; he is the real hero of the work. Bent over\r\nthe soil, patient as the oxen that he goads, he performs each day his\r\nsacred task; the years pass over his whitening head, and, from the dawn\r\nof life to its twilight, he follows ceaselessly the same endless furrow,\r\npursuing behind the plough his eternal pilgrimage.\r\n\r\nAround him the idle sleep, the careless sing; they pretend to cheer\r\nothers by their humming; they trill: \"Hoy! troly lolly!\" Piers shall\r\nfeed every one, except these useless ones; he shall not feed \"Jakke the\r\njogeloure and Jonet ... and Danyel the dys-playere and Denote the baude,\r\nand frere the faytoure, ...\" for, all whose name is entered \"in the\r\nlegende of lif\" must take life seriously.[656] There is no place in this\r\nworld for people who are not in earnest; every class that is content to\r\nperform its duties imperfectly and without sincerity, that fulfils them\r\nwithout eagerness, without passion, without pleasure, without striving\r\nto attain the best possible result and do better than the preceding\r\ngeneration, will perish. So much the more surely shall perish the class\r\nthat ceases to justify its privileges by its services: this is the great\r\nlaw propounded in our own day by Taine. Langland lets loose upon the\r\nindolent, the careless, the busybodies who talk much and work little, a\r\nfoe more terrible and more real then than now: Hunger. Piers undertakes\r\nthe care of all sincere people, and Hunger looks after the rest. All\r\nthis part of the poem is nothing but an eloquent declaration of man's\r\nduties, and is one of the finest pages of this \"Divine Comedy\" of the\r\npoor.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nLangland speaks as he thinks, impetuously; a sort of dual personality\r\nexists in him; he is the victim and not the master of his thought. And\r\nhis thought is so completely a separate entity, with wishes opposed to\r\nhis desires, that it appears to him in the solitudes of Malvern; and the\r\nmelody of lines heard not long ago occurs to the memory:\r\n\r\n    Je marchais un jour a pas lents\r\n    Dans un bois, sur une bruyere;\r\n    Au pied d'un arbre vint s'asseoir\r\n    Un jeune homme vetu de noir\r\n    Qui me ressemblait comme un frere ...[657]\r\n\r\nFilled with a similar feeling, the wandering dreamer had met, five\r\nhundred years before, in a \"wilde wildernesse and bi a wode-syde,\" a\r\n\"moche man\" who looked like himself; who knew him and called him by\r\nname:\r\n\r\n    And thus I went wide-where | walkyng myne one (alone),\r\n    By a wilde wildernesse | and bi a wode-syde ...\r\n    And under a lynde uppon a launde | lened I a stounde ...\r\n    A moche man, as me thoughte | and lyke to my-selve\r\n    Come and called me | by my kynde name,\r\n    \"What artow,\" quod I tho (then) | \"that thow my name knowest?\"\r\n    \"That thow wost wel,\" quod he | \"and no wyghte bettere.\"\r\n    \"Wote I what thow art?\" | \"Thought,\" seyde he thanne,\r\n    \"I have suwed (followed) the this sevene yere | sey thow me no rather\r\n      (sooner)?\"[658]\r\n\r\n\"Thought\" reigns supreme, and does with Langland what he chooses.\r\nLangland is unconscious of what he is led to; his visions are for him\r\nreal ones; he tells them as they rise before him; he is scarcely aware\r\nthat he invents; he stares at the sight, and wonders as much as we do;\r\nhe can change nothing; his personages are beyond his reach. There is\r\ntherefore nothing prepared, artistically arranged, or skilfully\r\ncontrived, in his poem; the deliberate hand of a man of the craft is\r\nnowhere to be seen. He obtains artistic effects, but without seeking for\r\nthem; he never selects or co-ordinates; he is suddenly led, and leads\r\nus, from one subject to another, without any better transition than an\r\n\"and thanne\" or a \"with that.\" And \"thanne\" we are carried a hundred\r\nmiles away, among entirely different beings, and frequently we hear no\r\nmore of the first ones. Or sometimes, even, the first reappear, but they\r\nare no longer the same; Piers Plowman personifies now the honest man of\r\nthe people, now the Pope, now Christ. Dowel, Dobet and Dobest have two\r\nor three different meanings. The art of transitions is as much dispensed\r\nwith in his poem as at the opera: a whistle of the scene-shifter--an\r\n\"and thanne\" of the poet--the palace of heaven fades away, and we find\r\nourselves in a smoky tavern in Cornhill.\r\n\r\nClouds pass over the sky, and sometimes sweep by the earth; their\r\nthickness varies, they take every shape: now they are soft, indolent\r\nmists, lingering in mountain hollows, that will rise towards noon, laden\r\nwith the scent of flowering lindens; now they are storm-clouds,\r\nthreatening destruction and rolling with thunder. Night comes on, and\r\nsuddenly the blackness is rent by so glaring a light that the plain\r\nassumes for an instant the hues of mid-day; then the darkness falls\r\nagain, deeper than before.\r\n\r\nThe poet moves among realities and abstractions, and sometimes the first\r\ndissolve in fogs, while the second condense into human beings, tangible\r\nand solid. On the Malvern hills, the mists are so fine, it is impossible\r\nto say: here they begin and here they end; it is the same in the\r\nVisions.\r\n\r\nIn the world of ethics, as among the realities of actual life, Langland\r\nexcels in summing up in one sudden memorable flash the whole doctrine\r\ncontained in the nebulous sermons of his abstract preachers; he then\r\nattains to the highest degree of excellence, without striving after it.\r\nIn another writer, the thing would have been premeditated, and the\r\nresult of his skill and cunning; here the effect is as unexpected for\r\nthe author as for the reader. He so little pretends to such felicities\r\nof speech that he never allows the grand impressions thus produced to\r\nlast any time; he utilises them, he is careful to make the best of the\r\noccasion. It seems as if he had conjured the lightning from the clouds\r\nunawares, and he thinks it his duty to turn it to use. The flash had\r\nunveiled the uppermost summits of the realm of thought, and there will\r\nremain in our hands a flickering rushlight that can at most help us\r\nupstairs.\r\n\r\nThe passionate sincerity which is the predominant trait of Langland's\r\ncharacter greatly contributed to the lasting influence of his poem. Each\r\nline sets forth his unconquerable aversion for all that is mere\r\nappearance and show, self-interested imposture; for all that is\r\nantagonistic to conscience, abnegation, sincerity. Such is the great and\r\nfundamental indignation that is in him; all the others are derived from\r\nthis. For, while his mind was impressed with the idea of the seriousness\r\nof life, he happened to live when the mediaeval period was drawing to its\r\nclose; and, as usually happens towards the end of epochs, people no\r\nlonger took in earnest any of the faiths and feelings which had supplied\r\nforegoing generations with their strength and motive power. He saw with\r\nhis own eyes knights preparing for war as if it were a hunt; learned men\r\nconsider the mysteries of religion as fit subjects to exercise one's\r\nminds in after-dinner discussions; the chief guardians of the flock busy\r\nthemselves with their \"owelles\" only to shear, not to feed them. Meed\r\nwas everywhere triumphant; her misdeeds had been vainly denounced; her\r\nreign had come; under the features of Alice Perrers she was now the\r\nparamour of the king!\r\n\r\nAt all such men and at all such things, Langland thunders anathema. Lack\r\nof sincerity, all the shapes and sorts of \"faux semblants,\" or\r\n\"merveilleux semblants,\" as Rutebeuf said, fill him with\r\ninextinguishable hatred. In shams and \"faux semblants\" he sees the true\r\nsource of good and evil, the touchstone of right and wrong, the main\r\ndifference between the worthy and the unworthy. He constantly recurs to\r\nthe subject by means of his preachings, epigrams, portraits,\r\ncaricatures; he broadens, he magnifies and multiplies his figures and\r\nhis precepts, so as to deepen our impression of the danger and number of\r\nthe adherents of \"Fals-Semblant.\" By such means, he hopes we shall at\r\nlast hate those whom he hates. Endlessly, therefore, in season and out\r\nof season, among the mists, across the streets, under the porches of the\r\nchurch, to the drowsy chant of his orations, to the whistle of his\r\nsatires, ever and ever again, he conjures up before our eyes the\r\nhideous grinning face of \"Fals-Semblant,\" the insincere. Fals-Semblant\r\nis never named by name; he assumes all names and shapes; he is the king\r\nwho reigns contrary to conscience, the knight perverted by Lady Meed,\r\nthe heartless man of law, the merchant without honesty, the friar, the\r\npardoner, the hermit, who under the garment of saints conceal hearts\r\nthat will rank them with the accursed ones. Fals-Semblant is the pope\r\nwho sells benefices, the histrion, the tumbler, the juggler, the adept\r\nof the vagrant race, who goes about telling tales and helping his\r\nlisteners to forget the seriousness of life. From the unworthy pope down\r\nto the lying juggler, all these men are the same man. Deceit stands\r\nbefore us; God's vengeance be upon him! Whenever and wherever Langland\r\ndetects Fals-Semblant, he loses control over himself; anger blinds him;\r\nit seems as if he were confronted by Antichrist.\r\n\r\nNo need to say whether he is then master of his words, and able to\r\nmeasure them. With him, in such cases, no _nuances_ or extenuations are\r\nadmissible; you are with or against Fals-Semblant; there is no middle\r\nway; a compromise is a treason; and is there anything worse than a\r\ntraitor? And thus he is led to sum up his judgment in such lines as\r\nthis:\r\n\r\n    He is worse than Judas | that giveth a japer silver.[659]\r\n\r\nIf we allege that there may be some shade of exaggeration in such a\r\nsentence, he will shrug his shoulders. The doubt is not possible, he\r\nthinks, and his plain proposition is self-evident.\r\n\r\nNo compromise! Travel through life without bending; go forward in a\r\nstraight line between the high walls of duty. Perform your own\r\nobligations; do not perform the obligations of others. To do your duty\r\nover-zealously, to take upon you the duty of others, would trouble the\r\nState; you approach, in so doing, the borderland of Imposture. The\r\nknight will fight for his country, and must not lose his time in fasting\r\nand in scourging himself. A fasting knight is a bad knight.\r\n\r\nMany joys are allowed. They are included, as a bed of flowers, between\r\nthe high walls of duty; love-flowers even grow there, to be plucked,\r\nunder the blue sky. But take care not to be tempted by that wonderful\r\nfemale Proteus, Lady Meed, the great corruptress. She disappears and\r\nreappears, and she, too, assumes all shapes; she is everywhere at the\r\nsame time: it seems as if the serpent of Eden had become the immense\r\nreptile that encircles the earth.\r\n\r\nThis hatred is immense, but stands alone in the heart of the poet.\r\nBeside it there is place for treasures of pity and mercy; the idea of so\r\nmany Saracens and Jews doomed wholesale to everlasting pain repels him;\r\nhe can scarcely accept it; he hopes they will be all converted, and\r\n\"turne in-to the trewe feithe\"; for \"Cryste cleped us alle.... Sarasenes\r\nand scismatikes ... and Jewes.\"[660] There is something pathetic, and\r\ntragic also, in his having to acknowledge that there is no cure for many\r\nevils, and that, for the present, resignation only can soothe the\r\nsuffering. With a throbbing heart he shows the unhappy and the lowly,\r\nwho must die before having seen the better days that were promised, the\r\nonly talisman that may help them: a scroll with the words, \"Thy will be\r\ndone!\"[661]\r\n\r\nThe truth is that there was a tender heart under the rough and rugged\r\nexterior of the impassioned, indignant, suffering poet; and thus he was\r\nable to sum up his life's ideal in this beautiful motto: _Disce, Doce,\r\nDilige_; in these words will be found the true interpretation of Dowel,\r\nDobet, and Dobest: \"Learn, Teach, Love.\"[662]\r\n\r\nThe poet's language is, if one may use the expression, like himself,\r\nabove all, sincere. Chaucer wished that words were \"cosyn to the dede;\"\r\nLangland holds the same opinion. While, in the mystic parts of his\r\nVisions, he uses a superabundance of fluid and abstract terms, that look\r\nlike morning mists and float along with his thoughts, his style becomes\r\nsuddenly sharp, nervous, and sinewy when he comes back to earth and\r\nmoves into the world of realities. Let some sudden emotion fill his\r\nsoul, and he will rise again, not in the mist this time, but in the rays\r\nof the sun; he will soar aloft, and we will wonder at the grandeur of\r\nhis eloquence. Whatever be his subject, he will coin a word, or distort\r\na meaning, or cram into an idiom more meaning than grammar, custom, or\r\ndictionary allow, rather than leave a gap between word and thought; both\r\nmust be fused together, and made one. If the merchants were honest, they\r\nwould not \"timber\" so high--raise such magnificent houses.[663] In other\r\nparts he uses realistic terms, noisy, ill-favoured expressions, which it\r\nis impossible to quote.\r\n\r\nHis vocabulary of words is the normal vocabulary of the period, the same\r\nnearly as Chaucer's. The poet of the \"Canterbury Tales\" has been often\r\nreproached with having used his all-powerful influence to obtain rights\r\nof citizenship in England for French words; but the accusation does not\r\nstand good, for Langland did not write for courtly men, and the\r\nadmixture of French words is no less considerable in his work.\r\n\r\nThe Visionary's poem offers a combination of several dialects; one,\r\nhowever, prevails; it is the Midland dialect. Chaucer used the\r\nEast-Midland, which is nearly the same, and was destined to survive and\r\nbecome the English language.\r\n\r\nLangland did not accept any of the metres used by Chaucer; he preferred\r\nto remain in closer contact with the Germanic past of his kin. Rhyme,\r\nthe main ornament of French verse, had been adopted by Chaucer, but was\r\nrejected by Langland, who gave to his lines the ornament best liked by\r\nAnglo-Saxons, Germans, and Scandinavians, namely, alliteration.[664]\r\n\r\nWhile their author continued to live obscure and unknown, the Visions,\r\nas soon as written, were circulated, and acquired considerable\r\npopularity throughout England. In spite of the time that has elapsed,\r\nand numberless destructions, there still remain forty-five manuscripts\r\nof the poem, more or less complete. \"Piers Plowman\" soon became a sign\r\nand a symbol, a sort of password, a personification of the labouring\r\nclasses, of the honest and courageous workman. John Ball invoked his\r\nauthority in his letter to the rebel peasants of the county of Essex in\r\n1381.[665] The name of Piers figured as an attraction on the title of\r\nnumerous treatises: there existed, as early as the fourteenth century,\r\n\"Credes\" of Piers Plowman, \"Complayntes\" of the Plowman, &c. Piers'\r\ncredit was made use of at the time of the Reformation, and in his name\r\nwere demanded the suppression of abuses and the transformation of the\r\nold order of things; he even appeared on the stage; Langland would have\r\nbeen sometimes greatly surprised to see what tasks were assigned to his\r\nhero.\r\n\r\nChaucer and Langland, the two great poets of the period, represent\r\nexcellently English genius, and the two races that have formed the\r\nnation. One more nearly resembles the clear-minded, energetic, firm,\r\npractical race of the latinised Celts, with their fondness for straight\r\nlines; the other resembles the race which had the deepest and especially\r\nthe earliest knowledge of tender, passionate, and mystic aspirations,\r\nand which lent itself most willingly to the lulls and pangs of hope and\r\ndespair, the race of the Anglo-Saxons. And while Chaucer sleeps, as he\r\nshould, under the vault of Westminster, some unknown tuft of Malvern\r\nmoss perhaps covers, as it also should, the ashes of the dreamer who\r\ntook Piers Plowman for his hero.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[629] Further details on Langland and his Visions, and in particular the\r\nelucidation (as far as I have been able to furnish it) of several\r\ndoubtful points, may be found in \"Piers Plowman, a contribution to the\r\nHistory of English Mysticism,\" London, 1894.

Rolls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n_PROSE._\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a long time, and up to our day, the title and dignity of \"Father of\r\nEnglish prose\" has been borne by Sir John Mandeville, of St. Albans,\r\nknight, who, \"in the name of God glorious,\" left his country in the year\r\nof grace 1322, on Michaelmas Day, and returned to Europe after an\r\nabsence of thirty-four years, twice as long as Robinson Crusoe remained\r\nin his desert island.\r\n\r\nThis title belongs to him no longer. The good knight of St. Albans, who\r\nhad seen and told so much, has dwindled before our eyes, has lost his\r\nsubstance and his outline, and has vanished like smoke in the air. His\r\ncoat of mail, his deeds, his journeys, his name: all are smoke. He first\r\nlost his character as a truthful writer; then out of the three versions\r\nof his book, French, English, and Latin, two were withdrawn from him,\r\nleaving him only the first. Existence now has been taken from him, and\r\nhe is left with nothing at all. Sir John Mandeville, knight, of St.\r\nAlbans, who crossed the sea in 1322, is a myth, and never existed; he\r\nhas joined, in the kingdom of the shades and the land of nowhere, his\r\ncontemporary the famous \"Friend of God of the Oberland,\" who some time\r\nago also ceased to have existed.\r\n\r\nOne thing however remains, and cannot be blotted out: namely, the book\r\nof travels bearing the name of Mandeville the translation of which is\r\none of the best and oldest specimens of simple and flowing English\r\nprose.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nThe same phenomenon already pointed out in connection with the\r\nAnglo-Saxons occurs again with regard to the new English people. For a\r\nlong time (and not to speak of practical useful works), poetry alone\r\nseems worthy of being remembered; most of the early monuments of the new\r\nlanguage for the sake of which the expense of parchment is incurred are\r\npoems; verse is used, even in works for which prose would appear much\r\nbetter fitted, such as history. Robert of Gloucester writes his\r\nchronicles in English verse, just as Wace and Benoit de Sainte-More had\r\nwritten theirs in French verse. After some while only it is noticed that\r\nthere is an art of prose, very delicate, very difficult, very worthy of\r\ncare, and that it is a mistake to look upon it in the light of a vulgar\r\ninstrument, on which every one can play without having learnt how, and\r\nto confine oneself to doing like Moliere's Monsieur Jourdain \"de la\r\nprose sans le savoir.\"\r\n\r\nAt the epoch at which we have arrived, and owing to the renovation and\r\nnew beginnings occasioned by the Conquest, English prose found itself\r\nfar behind French. In the fourteenth century, if French poets are poor,\r\nprose-writers are excellent; as early as the twelfth and thirteenth\r\nthere were, besides Joinville, many charming tale writers who had told\r\nin prose delightful things, the loves of Aucassin and Nicolette, for\r\nexample; now, without speaking of the novelists of the day, there is\r\nFroissart, and to name him is to say enough; for every one has read at\r\nleast a few pages of him, and a single page of Froissart, taken\r\nhaphazard in his works, will cause him to be loved. The language glides\r\non, clear, limpid, murmuring like spring water; and yet, in spite of\r\nits natural flow, art already appears. Froissart selects and chooses;\r\nthe title of \"historian,\" which he gives himself, is no mean one in his\r\neyes, and he strives to be worthy of it. The spring bubbles up in the\r\ndepths of the wood, and without muddying the water the artist knows how\r\nto vary its course at times, to turn it off into ready prepared\r\nchannels, and make it gush forth in fountains.\r\n\r\nIn England nothing so far resembles this scarcely perceptible and yet\r\nskilful art, a mixture of instinct and method, and many years will pass\r\nbefore prose becomes, like verse, an art. In the fourteenth century\r\nEnglish prose is used in most cases for want of something better, from\r\nnecessity, in order to be more surely understood, and owing to this its\r\nmonuments are chiefly translations, scientific or religious treatises,\r\nand sermons. An English Froissart would at that time have written in\r\nLatin; several of the chronicles composed in monasteries, at St. Albans\r\nand elsewhere, are written in a brisk and lively style, animated now by\r\nenthusiasm and now by indignation; men and events are freely judged;\r\ncharacteristic details find their place; the personages live, and move,\r\nand utter words the sound of which seems to reach us. Walsingham's\r\naccount of the revolt of the peasants in 1381, for example, well\r\ndeserves to be read, with the description of the taking of London that\r\nfollowed, the sack of the Tower and the Savoy Palace, the assassination\r\nof the archbishop,[666] the heroic act of the peasant Grindecobbe who,\r\nbeing set free on condition that he should induce the rebels to submit,\r\nmeets them and says: \"Act to-day as you would have done had I been\r\nbeheaded yesterday at Hertford,\"[667] and goes back to his prison to\r\nsuffer death. Every detail is found there, even the simple picturesque\r\ndetail; the rebels arm themselves as they can, with staves, rusty\r\nswords, old bows blackened by smoke, arrows \"on which only a single\r\nfeather remained.\" The account of the death of Edward III. in the same\r\nannals is gloomy and tragic and full of grandeur. In the \"Chronicon\r\nAngliae,\"[668] the anonymous author's burning hatred for John of Gaunt\r\ninspires him with some fiery pages: all of which would count among the\r\nbest of old English literature, had these historians used the national\r\nidiom. The prejudice against prose continued; to be admitted to the\r\nhonours of parchment it had first to be ennobled; and Latin served for\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nTranslations begin to appear, however, which is already an improvement.\r\nPious treatises had been early turned into English. John of Trevisa,\r\nborn in Cornwall, vicar of Berkeley, translates at a running pace, with\r\nnumerous errors, but in simple style, the famous Universal History,\r\n\"Polychronicon,\" of Ralph Higden,[669] and the scientific encyclopaedia,\r\n\"De Proprietatibus Rerum,\"[670] of Bartholomew the Englishman. The first\r\nof these works was finished in 1387, and had at the Renaissance the\r\nhonour of being printed by Caxton; the second was finished in 1398.\r\n\r\nThe English translation of the Travels of Mandeville enjoyed still\r\ngreater popularity. This translation is an anonymous one.[671] It has\r\nbeen found out to-day that the original text of the \"Travels\" was\r\ncompiled in French by Jean de Bourgogne, physician, usually called\r\nJohn-with-the-Beard, \"Joannes-ad-Barbam,\" who wrote various treatises,\r\none in particular on the plague, in 1365, who died at Liege in 1372, and\r\nwas buried in the church of the Guillemins, where his tomb was still to\r\nbe seen at the time of the French Revolution.[672] John seems to have\r\ninvented the character of Mandeville as Swift invented Gulliver, and\r\nDefoe Robinson Crusoe. Now that his imposture is discovered, the least\r\nwe can do is to acknowledge his skill: for five centuries Europe has\r\nbelieved in Mandeville, and the merit is all the greater, seeing that\r\nJohn-with-the-Beard did not content himself with merely making his hero\r\ntravel to a desert island; that would have been far too simple. No, he\r\nunites beforehand a Crusoe and a Gulliver in one; it is Crusoe at\r\nBrobdingnag; the knight comes to a land of giants; he does not see the\r\ngiants, it is true, but he sees their sheep (the primitive sheep of\r\nCentral Asia); elsewhere the inhabitants feed on serpents and hiss as\r\nserpents do; some men have dogs' faces; others raise above their head an\r\nenormous foot, which serves them for a parasol. Gulliver was not to\r\nbehold anything more strange. Still the whole was accepted with\r\nenthusiasm by the readers of the Middle Ages; with kindness and goodwill\r\nby the critics of our time. The most obvious lies were excused and even\r\njustified, and the success of the book was such that there remain about\r\nthree hundred manuscript copies of it, whereas of the authentic travels\r\nof Marco Polo there exist only seventy-five. \"Mandeville\" had more than\r\ntwenty-five editions in the fifteenth century and Marco Polo only\r\nfive.[673]\r\n\r\nNothing, indeed, is more cleverly persuasive than the manner in which\r\nJean de Bourgogne introduces his hero. He is an honest man, somewhat\r\nnaive and credulous perhaps, but one who does not lack good reasons to\r\njustify if need be his credulity; he has read much, and does not hide\r\nthe use he makes of others' journals; he reports what he has seen and\r\nwhat others have seen. For his aim is a practical one; he wants to write\r\na guide book, and receives information from all comers. The information\r\nsometimes is very peculiar; but Pliny is the authority: who shall be\r\nbelieved in if Pliny is not trusted? After a description of wonders, the\r\nknight takes breathing time and says: Of course you won't believe me;\r\nnor should I have believed myself if such things had been told me, and\r\nif I had not seen them. He felt so sure of his own honesty that he\r\nchallenged criticism; this disposition was even one of the causes why he\r\nhad written in French: \"And know you that I should have turned this\r\nbooklet into Latin in order to be more brief: but for the reason that\r\nmany understand better romance,\" that is French, \"than Latin, I wrote in\r\nromance, so that everybody will be able to understand it, and that the\r\nlords, knights, and other noblemen, who know little Latin or none, and\r\nhave been over the sea, perceive and understand whether I speak truth or\r\nnot. And if I make mistakes in my narrative for want of memory or for\r\nany cause, they will be able to check and correct me: for things seen\r\nlong ago, may be forgotten, and man's memory cannot embrace and keep\r\neverything.\"[674]\r\n\r\nAnd so the sail is spread, and being thus amply supplied with oratorical\r\nprecautions, our imaginary knight sets out on his grand voyage of\r\ndiscovery through the books of his closet. Having left St. Albans to\r\nvisit Jerusalem, China, the country of the five thousand islands, he\r\njourneys and sails through Pliny, Marco Polo, Odoric de Pordenone,[675]\r\nAlbert d'Aix, William of Boldensele, Pierre Comestor, Jacques de Vitry,\r\nbestiaries, tales of travels, collections of fables, books of dreams,\r\npatching together countless marvels, but yet, as he assures us, omitting\r\nmany so as not to weary our faith: It would be too long to say all; \"y\r\nseroit trop longe chose a tot deviser.\" With fanciful wonders are\r\nmingled many real ones, which served to make the rest believed in, and\r\nwere gathered from well-informed authors; thus Mandeville's immense\r\npopularity served at least to vulgarise the knowledge of some curious\r\nand true facts. He describes, for example, the artificial hatching of\r\neggs in Cairo; a tree that produces \"wool\" of which clothing is made,\r\nthat is to say the cotton-plant; a country of Asia where it is a mark of\r\nnobility for the women to have tiny feet, on which account they are\r\nbandaged in their infancy, that they may only grow to half their natural\r\nsize; the magnetic needle which points out the north to mariners; the\r\ncountry of the five thousand islands (Oceania); the roundness of the\r\nearth, which is such that the inhabitants of the Antipodes have their\r\nfeet directly opposite to ours, and yet do not fall off into space any\r\nmore than the earth itself falls there, though of much greater weight.\r\nPeople who start from their own country, and sail always in the same\r\ndirection, finally reach a land where their native tongue is spoken:\r\nthey have come back to their starting-point.\r\n\r\nIn the Middle Ages the English were already passionately fond of\r\ntravels; Higden and others had, as has been seen, noted this trait of\r\nthe national character. This account of adventures attributed to one of\r\ntheir compatriots could not fail therefore greatly to please them; they\r\ndelighted in Mandeville's book; it was speedily translated,[676] soon\r\nbecame one of the classics of the English language, and served, at the\r\ntime of its appearance, to vulgarise in England the use of that simple\r\nand easy-going prose of which it was a model in its day, the best that\r\nhad been seen till then.[677]\r\n\r\nVarious scientific and religious treatises were also written in prose;\r\nthose of Richard Rolle, hermit of Hampole, count amongst the oldest and\r\nmost remarkable.[678] We owe several to Chaucer; they pass unnoticed in\r\nthe splendour of his other works, and it is only fair they should.\r\nChaucer wrote in prose his tale of the parson, and his tale of Melibeus,\r\nboth taken from the French, his translation of Boethius, and his\r\ntreatise on the Astrolabe. His prose is laboured and heavy, sometimes\r\nobscure; he, whose poetical similes are so brilliant and graceful, comes\r\nto write, when he handles prose, such phrases as this: \"And, right by\r\nensaumple as the sonne is hid whan the sterres ben clustred (that is to\r\nseyn, whan sterres ben covered with cloudes) by a swifte winde that\r\nhighte Chorus, and that the firmament stant derked by wete ploungy\r\ncloudes, and that the sterres nat apperen up-on hevene, so that the\r\nnight semeth sprad up-on erthe: yif thanne the wind that highte Borias,\r\ny-sent out of the caves of the contree of Trace, beteth this night (that\r\nis to seyn, chaseth it a-wey, and discovereth the closed day): than\r\nshyneth Phebus y-shaken with sodein light, and smyteth with his bemes in\r\nmervelinge eyen.\"[679] Chaucer, the poet, in the same period of his\r\nlife, perhaps in the same year, had expressed, as we have seen, the same\r\nidea thus:\r\n\r\n    But right as whan the sonne shyneth brighte\r\n    In march that chaungeth ofte tyme his face,\r\n    And that a cloud is put with wind to flighte\r\n    Which over-sprat the sonne as for a space,\r\n    A cloudy thought gan thorugh hir soule pace,\r\n    That over-spradde hir brighte thoughtes alle.[680]\r\n\r\nAccustomed to poetry, Chaucer sticks fast in prose, the least obstacle\r\nstops him; he needs the blue paths of the air. High-flying birds are bad\r\nwalkers.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nUnder a different form, however, prose progressed in England during the\r\ncourse of the fourteenth century. This form is the oratorical.\r\n\r\nThe England of Chaucer and Langland, that poetical England whose prose\r\ntook so long to come to shape, was already, as we have seen, the\r\nparliamentary England that has continued up to this day. She defended\r\nher interests, bargained with the king, listened to the speeches,\r\nsometimes very modest ones, that the prince made her, and answered by\r\nremonstrances, sometimes very audacious. The affairs of the State being\r\neven then the affairs of all, every free man discussed them; public life\r\nhad developed to an extent with which nothing in Europe could be\r\ncompared; even bondmen on the day of revolt were capable of assigning\r\nthemselves a well-determined goal, and working upon a plan. They destroy\r\nthe Savoy as a means of marking their disapprobation of John of Gaunt\r\nand his policy; but do not plunder it, so as to prove they are fighting\r\nfor an idea: \"So that the whole nation should know they did nothing for\r\nthe love of lucre, death was decreed against any one who should dare to\r\nappropriate anything found in the palace. The innumerable gold and\r\nsilver objects there would be chopped up in small pieces with a hatchet,\r\nand the pieces thrown into the Thames or the sewers; the cloths of silk\r\nand gold would be torn. And it was done so.\"[681]\r\n\r\nMany eloquent speeches were delivered at this time, vanished words, the\r\nmemory of which is lost; the most impassioned, made on heaths or in\r\nforest glades, are only known to us by their results: these burning\r\nwords called armed men out of the earth. These speeches were in English;\r\nno text of them has been handed down to us; of one, however, the most\r\ncelebrated of all, we have a Latin summary; it is the famous English\r\nharangue made at Blackheath, by the rebel priest, John Ball, at the time\r\nof the taking of London.[682]\r\n\r\nUnder a quieter form, which might already be called the \"parliamentary\"\r\nform, but often with astonishing boldness and eloquence, public\r\ninterests are discussed during this century, but nearly always in French\r\nat the palace of Westminster. There, documents abound; the Rolls of\r\nParliament, an incomparable treasure, have come down to us, and nothing\r\nis easier than to attend, if so inclined, a session in the time of the\r\nPlantagenets. Specimens of questions and answers, of Government speeches\r\nand speeches of the Opposition, have been preserved. Moreover, some of\r\nthe buildings where these scenes took place still exist to-day.[683]\r\n\r\nFirst of all, and before the opening of the session, a \"general\r\nproclamation\" was read in the great hall of Westminster, that hall built\r\nby William Rufus, the woodwork of which was replaced by Richard II., and\r\nthat has been lately cleared of its cumbrous additions.[684] This\r\nproclamation forbids each and all to come to the place where Parliament\r\nsits, \"armed with hoquetons, armor, swords, and long knives or other\r\nsorts of weapons;\" for such serious troubles have been the result of\r\nthis wearing of arms that business has been impeded, and the members of\r\nParliament have been \"effreietz,\" frightened, by these long knives.\r\nThen, descending to lesser things, the proclamation goes on to forbid\r\nthe street-boys of London to play at hide-and-seek in the palace, or to\r\nperform tricks on the passers-by, such as \"to twitch off their hoods\"\r\nfor instance, which the proclamation in parliamentary style terms\r\nimproper games, \"jues nient covenables.\" But as private liberty should\r\nbe respected as much as possible, this prohibition is meant only for the\r\nduration of the session.[685]\r\n\r\nOn the day of the opening the king repairs to the place of the sittings,\r\nwhere he not unfrequently finds an empty room, many of the members or of\r\nthe \"great\" having been delayed on the way by bad weather, bad roads, or\r\nother impediments.[686] Another day is then fixed upon for the solemn\r\nopening of the business.\r\n\r\nAll being at last assembled, the king, the lords spiritual and temporal\r\nand the Commons, meet together in the \"Painted Chamber.\" The Chancellor\r\nexplains the cause of the summons, and the questions to be discussed.\r\nThis is an opportunity for a speech, and we have the text of a good\r\nmany of them. Sometimes it is a simple, clear, practical discourse,\r\nenumerating, without any studied phrases or pompous terms, the points\r\nthat are to be treated; sometimes it is a flowery and pretentious\r\noration, adorned with witticisms and quotations, and compliments\r\naddressed to the king, as is for instance the speech (in French) of the\r\nbishop of St. David's, Adam Houghton, Chancellor of England in 1377:\r\n\r\n\"Lords and Gentlemen, I have orders from my lord the Prince here\r\npresent, whom God save,\" the youthful Richard, heir to the throne, \"to\r\nexpound the reason why this Parliament was summoned. And true it is that\r\nthe wise suffer and desire to hear fools speak, as is affirmed by St.\r\nPaul in his Epistles, for he saith: _Libenter suffertis insipientes cum\r\nsitis ipsi sapientes._ And in as much as you are wise and I am a fool, I\r\nunderstand that you wish to hear me speak. And another cause there is,\r\nwhich will rejoice you if you are willing to hear me. For the Scripture\r\nsaith that every messenger bringing glad tidings, must be always\r\nwelcome; and I am a messenger that bringeth you good tidings, wherefore\r\nI must needs be welcome.\"\r\n\r\nAll these pretty things are to convey to them that the king, Edward\r\nIII., then on the brink of the grave, is not quite so ill, which should\r\nbe a cause of satisfaction for his subjects. Another cause of joy, for\r\neverything seems to be considered as such by the worthy bishop, is this\r\nillness itself; \"for the Scripture saith: _Quos diligo castigo_, which\r\nproves that God him loves, and that he is blessed of God.\" The king is\r\nto be a \"vessel of grace,\" _vas electionis_.[687] The Chancellor\r\ncontinues thus at length, heedless of the fact that the return of Alice\r\nPerrers to the old king belies his Biblical applications.\r\n\r\nSimon Sudbury, Archbishop of Canterbury, who was to die such a dreadful\r\ndeath, from the eighth blow of the axe, after having lost the hand which\r\nhe carried to the first wound, spoke in much the same style. He opened\r\nin these terms the first parliament of Richard II.:\r\n\r\n\"_Rex tuus venit tibi._--Lords and Gentlemen, the words which I have\r\nspoken signify in French: Your king comes to thee.--And thereupon, the\r\nsaid archbishop gave several good reasons agreeing with his subject, and\r\ndivided his said subject in three parts, as though it had been a\r\nsermon.\"\r\n\r\nIn truth it is a sermon; the Gospel is continually quoted, and serves\r\nfor unexpected comparisons. The youthful Richard has come to Parliament,\r\njust as the Blessed Virgin went to see St. Elizabeth; the joy is the\r\nsame: \"_Et exultavit infans in utero ejus._\"[688]\r\n\r\nFortunately, all did not lose themselves in such flowery mazes. William\r\nThorpe, William of Shareshull, William of Wykeham, John Knyvet, &c.,\r\nmake business-like speeches, simple, short, and to the point: \"My Lords,\r\nand you of the Commons,\" says Chancellor Knyvet, \"you well know how\r\nafter the peace agreed upon between our lord the King and his\r\nadversaries of France, and openly infringed by the latter, the king sent\r\nsoldiers and nobles across the sea to defend _us_, which they do, but\r\nare hard pressed by the enemy. If they protect us, we must help them.\"\r\n\r\nThe reasoning is equally clear in Wykeham's speeches, and with the same\r\nskill he makes it appear as if the Commons had a share in all the king's\r\nactions: \"Gentlemen, you well know how, in the last Parliament, the\r\nking, _with your consent_, again took the title of King of\r\nFrance....\"[689]\r\n\r\nThese speeches being heard, and the \"receivers\" and \"triers\" of\r\npetitions having been appointed,[690] the two houses divided, and\r\ndeliberated apart from each other; the Lords retired \"to the White\r\nChamber\"; the Commons remained \"in the Painted Chamber.\" At other times\r\n\"the said Commons were told to withdraw by themselves to their old place\r\nin the Chapter House of Westminster Abbey,\"[691] that beautiful Chapter\r\nHouse still in existence, which had been built under Henry III.\r\n\r\nThen the real debates began, interrupted by the most impassioned\r\nspeeches. They were not reported, and only a faint echo has reached us.\r\nTraces of the sentiments which animated the Commons are found, however,\r\nin the petitions they drew up, which were like so many articles of the\r\nbargains contracted by them. For they did not allow themselves to be\r\ncarried away by the eloquent and tender speeches of the Government\r\norators; they were practical and cold-blooded; they agreed to make\r\nconcessions provided concessions were made to them, and they added an\r\nannulling clause in case the king refused: \"In case the conditions are\r\nnot complied with, they shall not be obliged to grant the aid.\"[692] The\r\ndiscussions are long and minute in both houses; members do not meet for\r\nform's sake; decisions are not lightly taken: \"Of which things,\" we read\r\nin the Rolls, \"they treated at length.\"[693] In another case, the\r\nCommons, from whom a ready-made answer was expected, announce that \"they\r\nwish to talk together,\" and they continue to talk from the 24th of\r\nJanuary to the 19th of February.[694] Only too glad was the Government\r\nwhen the members did not declare \"that they dare not assent without\r\ndiscussing the matter with the Commons of their shire,\"[695] that is to\r\nsay, without consulting their constituents. And this they do, though\r\nWilliam de la Pole and others, sent \"by our lord the king from thence\r\n(that is from France) as envoys,\" had modestly explained the urgency of\r\nthe case, and \"the cause of the long stay the king had made in these\r\naforesaid parts, without riding against his enemies,\"[696] this cause\r\nbeing lack of money.\r\n\r\nWhen the Commons have at last come to a decision, they make it known in\r\nthe presence of the Lords through the medium of their Speaker, or, as he\r\nwas called in the French of the period, the one who had the words for\r\nthem: \"Qui avoit les paroles pur les Communes d'Engleterre en cest\r\nParlement.\"[697] In these replies especially, and in the petitions\r\npresented at the same time, are found traces of the vehemence displayed\r\nin the Chapter House. The boldness of the answers and of the\r\nremonstrances is extraordinary, and from their tone can be conceived\r\nwith what power and freedom civil eloquence, of which England has since\r\nproduced so many admirable specimens, displayed itself, even at that\r\ndistant epoch.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable case is that of the Good Parliament of 1376, in\r\nwhich, after having deliberated apart, the Commons join the other house,\r\nand by the mouth of their Speaker, Peter de la Mare, bring in their bill\r\nof complaints against royalty: \"And after that the aforesaid Commons\r\ncame to Parliament, openly protesting that they were as willing and\r\ndetermined to help their noble liege lord ... as any others had ever\r\nbeen, in any time past.... But they said it seemed to them an undoubted\r\nfact, that if their liege lord had always had around him loyal\r\ncounsellors and good officers ... our lord the king would have been very\r\nrich in treasure, and therefore would not have had such great need of\r\nburdening his Commons, either with subsidy, talliage, or otherwise....\"\r\nA special list of grievances is drawn up against the principal\r\nprevaricators; their names are there, and their crimes; the king's\r\nmistress, Alice Perrers, is not forgotten. Then follow the petitions of\r\nthe Commons, the number of which is enormous, a hundred and forty in\r\nall, in which abuses are pointed out one by one.[698]\r\n\r\nFormerly, say the Commons, \"bishoprics, as well as other benefices of\r\nHoly Church, used to be, after true elections, in accordance with\r\nsaintly considerations and pure charity, assigned to people found to be\r\nworthy of clerical promotion, men of clean life and holy behaviour,\r\nwhose intention it was to stay on their benefices, there to preach,\r\nvisit, and shrive their parishioners.... And so long as these good\r\ncustoms were observed, the realm was full of all sorts of prosperity, of\r\ngood people and loyal, good clerks and clergy, two things that always go\r\ntogether....\" The encroachments of the See of Rome in England are, for\r\nall right-minded people, \"great subject of sorrow and of tears.\" Cursed\r\nbe the \"sinful city of Avignon,\" where simony reigns, so that \"a sorry\r\nfellow who knows nothing of what he ought and is worthless\" will receive\r\na benefice of the value of a thousand marcs, \"when a doctor of decree\r\nand a master of divinity will be only too glad to secure some little\r\nbenefice of the value of twenty marcs.\" The foreigners who are given\r\nbenefices in England \"will never see their parishioners ... and more\r\nharm is done to Holy Church by such bad Christians than by all the Jews\r\nand Saracens in the world.... Be it again remembered that God has\r\ncommitted his flock to the care of our Holy Father the Pope, that they\r\nmight be fed and not shorn.\"[699] The Commons fear nothing; neither king\r\nnor Pope could make them keep silence. In their mind the idea begins to\r\ndawn that the kingdom is theirs, and the king too; they demand that\r\nRichard, heir to the throne, shall be brought to them; they wish to see\r\nhim; and he is shown to them.[700]\r\n\r\nIn spite of the progress made by the English language, French continued\r\nto be used at Westminster. It remained as a token of power and an emblem\r\nof authority, just as modern castles are still built with towers, though\r\nnot meant to be defended by cannon. It was a sign, and this sign has\r\nsubsisted, since the formula by which the laws are ratified is still in\r\nFrench at the present time. English, nevertheless, began to make an\r\nappearance even at Westminster. From 1363,[701] the opening speeches are\r\nsometimes in English; in 1399, the English tongue was used in the chief\r\nacts and discourses relating to the deposition of Richard. On Monday,\r\nthe 29th of September, the king signed his act of resignation; on the\r\nfollowing day a solemn meeting of Parliament took place, in presence of\r\nall the people, in Westminster Hall; the ancient throne containing\r\nJacob's stone, brought from Scotland by Edward I., and which can still\r\nbe seen in the abbey, had been placed in the hall, and covered with\r\ncloth of gold, \"cum pannis auri.\" Richard's act of resignation was read\r\n\"first in Latin, then in English,\" and the people showed their\r\napprobation of the same by applause. Henry then came forward, claimed\r\nthe kingdom, in English, and seated himself on the throne, in the midst\r\nof the acclamations of those present. The Archbishop of Canterbury\r\ndelivered an oration, and the new king, speaking again, offered his\r\nthanks in English to \"God, and yowe Spirituel and Temporel, and alle the\r\nAstates of the lond.\"[702] There is no more memorable sign of the\r\nchanges that had taken place than the use made of the English language\r\non an occasion like this, by a prince who had no title to the crown but\r\npopular favour.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nAll these translators were necessarily wanting in originality (less,\r\nhowever, than they need have been), and all these orators spoke for the\r\nmost part in French. In their hands, English prose could not be\r\nperfected to a very high degree. It progressed, however, owing to them,\r\nbut owing much more to an important personage, who made common English\r\nhis fighting weapon, John Wyclif, to whom the title of \"Father of\r\nEnglish prose\" rightfully belongs, now that Mandeville has dissolved in\r\nsmoke. Wyclif, Langland, and Chaucer are the three great figures of\r\nEnglish literature in the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nWyclif belonged to the rich and respected family of the Wyclifs, lords\r\nof the manor of Wyclif, in Yorkshire.[703] He was born about 1320, and\r\ndevoted himself early to a scientific and religious calling. He studied\r\nat Oxford, where he soon attracted notice, being one of those men of\r\ncharacter who occupy from the beginning of their lives, without seeking\r\nfor it, but being, as it seems, born to it, a place apart, amid the limp\r\nmultitude of men. The turn of his mind, the originality of his views,\r\nthe firmness of his will, his learning, raised him above others; he was\r\none of those concerning whom it is at once said they are \"some one;\" and\r\nseveral times in the course of his existence he saw the University, the\r\nking, the country even, turn to him when \"some one\" was needed.\r\n\r\nHe was hardly thirty-five when, the college of Balliol at Oxford having\r\nlost its master, he was elected to the post. In 1366 Parliament ruled\r\nthat the Pope's claim to the tribute promised by King John should no\r\nlonger be recognised, and Wyclif was asked to draw up a pamphlet\r\njustifying the decision.[704] In 1374 a diplomatic mission was entrusted\r\nto him, and he went to Bruges, with several other \"ambassatores,\" to\r\nnegotiate with the Pope's representatives.[705] He then had the title of\r\ndoctor of divinity.\r\n\r\nVarious provincial livings were successively bestowed upon him: that of\r\nFillingham in 1361; that of Ludgarshall in 1368; that of Lutterworth, in\r\nLeicestershire, in 1374, which he kept till his death. He divided his\r\ntime between his duties as rector, his studies, his lectures at Oxford,\r\nand his life in London, where he made several different stays, and\r\npreached some of his sermons.\r\n\r\nThese quiet occupations were interrupted from time to time owing to the\r\nstorms raised by his writings. But so great was his fame, and so eminent\r\nhis personality, that he escaped the terrible consequences that heresy\r\nthen involved. He had at first alarmed religious authority by his\r\npolitical theories on the relations of Church and State, next on the\r\nreformation of the Church itself; finally he created excessive scandal\r\nby attacking dogmas and by discussing the sacraments. Summoned the first\r\ntime to answer in respect of his doctrines, he appeared in St. Paul's,\r\nin 1377, attended by the strange patrons that a common animosity against\r\nthe high dignitaries of the Church had gained for him; John of Gaunt,\r\nDuke of Lancaster, and Lord Henry Percy accompanied him. The duke,\r\nlittle troubled by scruples, loudly declared, in the middle of the\r\nchurch, that he would drag the bishop out of the cathedral by the hair\r\nof his head. These words were followed by an indescribable tumult.\r\nIndignant at this insult, the people of the City drove the duke from the\r\nchurch, pursued him through the town, and laid siege to the house of\r\nJohn of Ypres, a rich merchant with whom he had gone to sup. Luckily for\r\nthe prince, the house opened on the Thames. He rose in haste, knocking\r\nhis legs against the table, and, without stopping to drink the cordial\r\noffered him, slipped into a boat and fled, as fast as oars could carry\r\nhim, to his sister-in-law's, the Princess of Wales, at Kennington.[706]\r\nThe summoning of Wyclif thus had no result.\r\n\r\nBut the Pope, in the same year, launched against the English theologian\r\nbulls pointing out eighteen erroneous propositions contained in his\r\nwritings, and enjoining that the culprit should be put in prison if he\r\nrefused to retract. The University of Oxford, being already a power at\r\nthat time, proud of its privileges, jealous in maintaining solidarity\r\nbetween its members, imbued with those ideas of opposition to the Pope\r\nwhich were increasing in England, considered the decree as an excessive\r\nexercise of authority. It examined the propositions, and declared them\r\nto be orthodox, though capable of wrong interpretations, on which\r\naccount Wyclif should go to London and explain himself.[707]\r\n\r\nHe is found, therefore, in London in the beginning of 1378; the\r\nbishops are assembled in the still existing chapel of Lambeth Palace.\r\nBut by one of those singularities that allow us to realise how\r\nthe limits of the various powers were far from being clearly defined, it\r\nhappened that the bishops had received positive orders not to condemn\r\nWyclif. The prohibition proceeded from a woman, the Princess of Wales,\r\nwidow of the Black Prince. The prelates, however, were spared the\r\ntrouble of choosing between the Pope and the lady; for the second time\r\nWyclif was saved by a riot; a crowd favourable to his ideas invaded the\r\npalace, and no sentence could be given. Any other would have appeared\r\nthe more guilty; he only lived the more respected. He was then at the\r\nheight of his popularity; a new public statement that he had just issued\r\nin favour of the king against the Pope had confirmed his reputation as\r\nadvocate and defender of the kingdom of England.[708]\r\n\r\nHe resumed, therefore, in peace his work of destruction, and began to\r\nattack dogmas. Besides his writings and his speeches, he used, in order\r\nto popularise his doctrines, his \"simple priests,\" or \"poor priests,\"\r\nwho, without being formed into a religious order, imitated the wandering\r\nlife of the friars, but not their mendicity, and strove to attain the\r\nideal which the friars had fallen short of. They went about preaching\r\nfrom village to village, and the civil authority was alarmed by the\r\npolitical and religious theories expounded to the people by these\r\nwanderers, who journeyed \"from county to county, and from town to town,\r\nin certain habits under dissimulation of great holiness, without license\r\nof our Holy Father the Pope, or of the ordinary of the diocese.\"[709]\r\nWyclif justified these unlicensed preachings by the example of St. Paul,\r\nwho, after his conversion, \"preechide fast, and axide noo leve of Petir\r\nherto, for he hadde leve of Jesus Crist.\"[710]\r\n\r\nFrom this time forth Wyclif began to circulate on the sacraments, and\r\nespecially on the Eucharist, opinions that Oxford even was unable to\r\ntolerate; the University condemned them. Conformably to his own theory,\r\nwhich tended, as did that of the Commons, towards a royal supremacy,\r\nWyclif appealed not to the Pope but to the king, and in the meantime\r\nrefused to submit. This was carrying boldness very far. John of Gaunt\r\nseparates from his _protege_; Courtenay, bishop of London, calls\r\ntogether a Council which condemns Wyclif and his adherents (1382); the\r\nfollowers are pursued, and retract or exile themselves; but Wyclif\r\ncontinues to live in perfect quiet. Settled at Lutterworth, from whence\r\nhe now rarely stirred, he wrote more than ever, with a more and more\r\ncaustic and daring pen. The papal schism, which had begun in 1378, had\r\ncast discredit on the Holy See; Wyclif's work was made the easier by it.\r\nAt last Urban VI., the Pope whom England recognised, summoned him to\r\nappear in his presence, but an attack of paralysis came on, and Wyclif\r\ndied in his parish on the last day of the year 1384. \"Organum\r\ndiabolicum, hostis Ecclesiae, confusio vulgi, haereticorum idolum,\r\nhypocritarum speculum, schismatis incentor, odii seminator, mendacii\r\nfabricator\"[711]: such is the funeral oration inscribed in his annals,\r\nat this date, by Thomas Walsingham, monk of St. Albans. By order of the\r\nCouncil of Constance, his ashes were afterwards thrown to the winds, and\r\nthe family of the Wyclifs of Wyclif, firmly attached to the old faith,\r\nerased him from their genealogical tree. When the Reformation came, the\r\nfamily remained Catholic, and this adherence to the Roman religion seems\r\nto have been the cause of its decay: \"The last of the Wyclifs was a poor\r\ngardener, who dined every Sunday at Thorpe Hall, as the guest of Sir\r\nMarmaduke Tunstall, on the strength of his reputed descent.\"[712]\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nWyclif had begun early to write, using at first only Latin.[713]\r\nInnumerable treatises of his exist, many of which are still\r\nunpublished, written in a Latin so incorrect and so English in its turns\r\nthat \"often the readiest way of understanding an obscure passage is to\r\ntranslate it into English.\"[714] He obviously attracted the notice of\r\nhis contemporaries, not by the elegance of his style, but by the power\r\nof his thought.\r\n\r\nHis thought deserved the attention it received. His mind was, above all,\r\na critical one, opposed to formulas, to opinions without proofs, to\r\ntraditions not justified by reason. Precedents did not overawe him, the\r\nmysterious authority of distant powers had no effect on his feelings. He\r\nliked to look things and people in the face, with a steady gaze, and the\r\nmore important the thing was and the greater the authority claimed, the\r\nless he felt disposed to cast down his eyes.\r\n\r\nSoon he wished to teach others to open theirs, and to see for\r\nthemselves. By \"others\" he meant every one, and not only clerks or the\r\ngreat. He therefore adopted the language of every one, showing himself\r\nin that a true Englishman, a partisan of the system of free\r\ninvestigation, so dear since to the race. He applied this doctrine to\r\nall that was then an object of faith, and step by step, passing from the\r\nabstract to the concrete, he ended by calling for changes, very similar\r\nto those England adopted at the Reformation, and later on in the time of\r\nthe Puritans.\r\n\r\nHis starting-point was as humble and abstract as his conclusions were,\r\nsome of them, bold and practical. A superhuman ideal had been proposed\r\nby St. Francis to his disciples; they were to possess nothing, but beg\r\ntheir daily bread and help the poor. Such a rule was good for apostles\r\nand angels; it was practised by men. They were not long able to\r\nwithstand the temptation of owning property, and enriching themselves;\r\nin the fourteenth century their influence was considerable, and their\r\npossessions immense. Thin subterfuges were resorted to in order to\r\njustify this change: they had only the usufruct of their wealth, the\r\nreal proprietor being the Pope. From that time two grave questions arose\r\nand were vehemently discussed in Christendom: What should be thought of\r\nthe poverty and mendicity of Christ and his apostles? What is property,\r\nand what is the origin of the power whence it proceeds?\r\n\r\nIn the first rank of the combatants figured, in the fourteenth century,\r\nan Englishman, Richard Fitzralph, archbishop of Armagh, \"Armachanus,\"\r\nwho studied the question of property, and contested the theory of the\r\nfriars in various sermons and treatises, especially in his work: \"De\r\npauperie Salvatoris,\" composed probably between 1350 and 1356.[715]\r\n\r\nWyclif took his starting-point from the perfectly orthodox writings of\r\nFitzralph, and borrowed from him nearly the whole of his great theory of\r\n\"Dominium,\" or lordship, power exercised either over men, or over\r\nthings, domination, property, possession. But he carried his conclusions\r\nmuch farther, following the light of logic, as was the custom of\r\nschools, without allowing himself to be hindered by the radicalism of\r\nthe consequences and the material difficulties of the execution.\r\n\r\nThe theory of \"Dominium,\" adopted and popularised by\r\nWyclif, is an entirely feudal one. According to him, all lordship comes\r\nfrom God; the Almighty bestows it on man as a fief, in consideration of\r\na service or condition the keeping of His commandments. Deadly sin\r\nbreaks the contract, and deprives the tenant of his right to the fief;\r\ntherefore no man in a state of deadly sin possesses any of the lordships\r\ncalled property, priesthood, royalty, magistracy. All which is summed up\r\nby Wyclif in his proposition: any \"dominium\" has grace for its\r\nfoundation. By such a theory, the whole social order is shaken; neither\r\nPope nor king is secure on his throne, nor priest in his living, nor\r\nlord in his estate.\r\n\r\nThe confusion is all the greater from the fact that a multitude of other\r\nsubversive conclusions are appended to this fundamental theory: While\r\nsinners lose all lordship, the good possess all lordship; to man, in a\r\nstate of \"gratia gratificante,\" belongs the whole of what comes from\r\nGod; \"in re habet omnia bona Dei.\"[716] But how can that be? The easiest\r\nthing in the world, replies Wyclif, whom nothing disturbs: all goods\r\nshould be held in common, \"Ergo omnia debent esse communia\"[717]; wives\r\nshould be alone excepted.--The Bible is a kind of Koran in which\r\neverything is found; no other law should be obeyed save that one alone;\r\ncivil and canonical laws are useless if they agree with the Bible, and\r\ncriminal if they are opposed to it.[718]--Royalty is not the best form\r\nof government; an aristocratic system is better, similar to that of the\r\nJudges in Israel.[719]--Neither heirship nor popular election is\r\nsufficient for the transmission of the crown; grace is needed\r\nbesides.[720]--The bequeathing to the Church of estates which will\r\nbecome mortmain lands is inadmissible: \"No one can transmit more rights\r\nthan he possesses, and no one is personally possessed of rights of civil\r\nlordship extending beyond the term of life.\"[721]--If the convent or the\r\npriest make a bad use of their wealth, the temporal power will be doing\r\n\"a very meritorious thing\" in depriving them of it.[722]\r\n\r\nThe whole order of things is unhinged, and we are nearing chaos. It is\r\ngoing so far that Wyclif cannot refrain from inserting some of those\r\nslight restrictions which the logicians of the Middle Ages were fond of\r\nslipping into their writings. In time of danger this was the secret door\r\nby which they made their escape, turning away from the stake. Wyclif is\r\nan advocate of communism; but he gives to understand that it is not for\r\nnow; it is a distant ideal. After us the deluge! Not so, answer the\r\npeasants of 1381; the deluge at once: \"Omnia debent esse communia!\"\r\n\r\nIf all lordship vanishes through sin, who shall be judge of the sin of\r\nothers? All real lordship vanishes from the sinner, answered Wyclif, but\r\nthere remains to him, by the permission of God, a power _de facto_, that\r\nit is not given us to remove; evil triumphs, but with God's consent; the\r\nChristian must obey the wicked king and bishop: \"Deus debet obedire\r\ndiabolo.\"[723] But the dissatisfied only adopted the first part of the\r\ntheory, and instead of submitting to Simon Sudbury, their archbishop, of\r\nwhom they disapproved, they cut off his head.\r\n\r\nThese were certainly extreme and exceptional consequences, to which\r\nWyclif only contributed in a slight measure. The lasting and permanent\r\nresult of the doctrine was to strengthen the Commons of England in the\r\naim they already had in view, namely, to diminish the authority\r\nexercised over them by the Pope, and to loosen the ties that bound the\r\nkingdom to Rome. Wyclif pointed out that, contrary to the theory of\r\nBoniface VIII. (bull \"Unam Sanctam\"), there does not exist in this world\r\none single supreme and unequalled sovereignty; the Pope is not the sole\r\ndepositary of divine power. Since all lordship proceeds from God, that\r\nof the king comes from Him, as well as that of the Pope; kings\r\nthemselves are \"vikeris of God\"; beside the Pope, and not below him,\r\nthere is the king.[724]\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nThe English will thus be sole rulers in their island. They must also be\r\nsole keepers of their consciences, and for that Wyclif is to teach them\r\nfree investigation. All, then, must understand him; and he begins to\r\nwrite in English. His English works are numerous; sermons, treatises,\r\ntranslations; they fill volumes.[725]\r\n\r\nBefore all the Book of truth was to be placed in the hands of everybody,\r\nso that none need accept without check the interpretations of others.\r\nWith the help of a few disciples, Wyclif began to translate the Bible\r\ninto English. To translate the Scriptures was not forbidden. The Church\r\nonly required that the versions should be submitted to her for approval.\r\nThere already existed several, complete or partial, in various\r\nlanguages; a complete one in French, written in the thirteenth\r\ncentury,[726] and several partial ones in English. Wyclif's version\r\nincludes the whole of the canonical books, and even the apocryphal ones;\r\nthe Gospels appear to have been translated by himself, the Old Testament\r\nchiefly by his disciple, Nicholas of Hereford. The task was an immense\r\none, the need pressing; the work suffered from the rapidity with which\r\nit was performed. A revision of the work of Nicholas was begun under\r\nWyclif's direction, but only finished after his death.[727]\r\n\r\nNo attempt at elegance is found in this translation; the language is\r\nrugged, and on that account the better adapted to the uncouthness of the\r\nholy Word. Harsh though it be we feel, however, that it is tending\r\ntowards improvement; the meaning of the words becomes more precise,\r\nowing to the necessity of giving to the sacred phrases their exact\r\nsignification; the effort is not always successful, but it is a\r\ncontinued one, and it is an effort in the right direction. It was soon\r\nperceived to what need the undertaking answered. Copies of the work\r\nmultiplied in astonishing fashion. In spite of the wholesale destruction\r\nwhich was ordered, there remain a hundred and seventy manuscripts, more\r\nor less complete, of Wyclif's Bible. For some time, it is true, the\r\ncopying of it had not been opposed by the ecclesiastical authority, and\r\nthe version was only condemned twenty-four years after the death of the\r\nauthor, by the Council of Oxford.[728] In the England of the\r\nPlantagenets could be foreseen the England of the Tudors, under whom\r\nthree hundred and twenty-six editions of the Bible were printed in less\r\nthan a century, from 1525 to 1600.\r\n\r\nBut Wyclif's greatest influence on the development of prose was\r\nexercised by means of his sermons and treatises. In these, the reformer\r\ngives himself full scope; he alters his tone at need, employs all means,\r\nfrom the most impassioned eloquence down to the most trivial pleasantry,\r\nmeant to delight men of the lower class. Put to such varied uses, prose\r\ncould not but become a more workable instrument. True it is that Wyclif\r\nnever seeks after artistic effect in his English, any more than in his\r\nLatin. His sermons regularly begin by: \"This gospel tellith.... This\r\ngospel techith alle men that ...\" and he continues his arguments in a\r\nclear and measured style, until he comes to one of those burning\r\nquestions about which he is battling; then his irony bursts forth, he\r\nuses scathing similes; he thunders against those \"emperoure bishopis,\"\r\ntaken up with worldly cares; his speech is short and haughty; he knows\r\nhow to condense his whole theory in one brief, clear-cut phrase, easy to\r\nremember, that every one will know by heart, and which it will not be\r\neasy to answer. Why are the people preached to in a foreign tongue?\r\nChrist, when he was with his apostles, \"taughte hem oute this prayer,\r\nbot be thou syker, nother in Latyn nother in Frensche, bot in the\r\nlangage that they usede to speke.\"[729] How should popes be above kings?\r\n\"Thus shulden popis be suget to kynges, for thus weren bothe Crist and\r\nPetre.\"[730] How believe in indulgences sold publicly by pardoners on\r\nthe market-places, and in that inexhaustible \"treasury\" of merits laid\r\nup in heaven that the depositaries of papal favour are able to\r\ndistribute at their pleasure among men for money? Each merit is rewarded\r\nby God, and consequently the benefit of it cannot be applicable to any\r\none who pays: \"As Peter held his pees in grauntinge of siche thingis, so\r\nshulden thei holden ther pees, sith thei ben lasse worth than\r\nPetir.\"[731]\r\n\r\nNext to these brief arguments are familiar jests, gravely uttered, with\r\nscarcely any perceptible change in the expression of the lips, jests\r\nthat Englishmen have been fond of in all times. If he is asked of what\r\nuse are the \"letters of fraternity,\" sold by the friars to their\r\ncustomers, to give them a share in the superabundant merits of the whole\r\norder, Wyclif replies with a serious air: \"Bi siche resouns thinken many\r\nmen that this lettris mai do good for to covere mostard pottis.\"[732]\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to follow him in all the places where he would fain lead\r\nus. He terrified the century by the boldness of his touch; when he was\r\nseen to shake the frail holy thing with a ruthless hand, all eyes turned\r\naway, and his former protectors withdrew from him.[733] He did not,\r\nhowever, carry his doubt to the extreme end; according to his doctrine\r\nthe _substance_ of the host, the particle of matter, is not the matter\r\nitself, the living flesh of the body that Jesus Christ had on earth;\r\nthis substance is bread; only by a miracle which is the effect of\r\nconsecration, the body of Christ is present sacramentally; that is to\r\nsay, all the benefits, advantages, and virtues which emanate from it\r\nare attached to the host as closely as the soul of men is united to\r\ntheir body.[734]\r\n\r\nThe other sacraments,[735] ecclesiastical hierarchy, the tithes\r\ncollected by the clergy, are not more respectfully treated by him. These\r\ncriticisms and teachings had all the more weight owing to the fact that\r\nthey were delivered from a pulpit and fell from the lips of an\r\nauthorised master, whose learning was acknowledged even by his\r\nadversaries: \"A very eminent doctor, a peerless and incomparable\r\none,\"[736] says Knighton. Still better than Langland's verses, his\r\nforcible speech, by reason of his station, prepared the way for the\r\ngreat reforms of the sixteenth century. He already demands the\r\nconfiscation of the estates of the monasteries, accomplished later by\r\nHenry VIII.; he appeals at every page of his treatises to the secular\r\narm, hoping by its means to bring back humility by force into the heart\r\nof prelates.\r\n\r\nBut he is so far removed from its realisation that his dream dazzles\r\nhim, and urges him on to defend chimerical schemes. He wishes the wealth\r\nof the clergy to be taken from them and bestowed upon poor, honest,\r\nbrave, trustworthy gentlemen, who will defend the country; and he does\r\nnot perceive that these riches would have fallen principally into the\r\nhands of turbulent and grasping courtiers, as happened in the sixteenth\r\ncentury.[737] He is carried away by his own reasonings, so that the\r\nUtopian or paradoxical character of his statements escape him. Wanting\r\nto minimise the power of the popes, he protests against the rules\r\nfollowed for their election, and goes on to say concerning the vote by\r\nballot: \"Sith ther ben fewe wise men, and foolis ben without noumbre,\r\nassent of more part of men makith evydence that it were foli.\"[738]\r\n\r\nHis disciples, _Lollards_ as they were usually called, a name the origin\r\nof which has been much discussed, survived him, and his simple priests\r\ncontinued, for a time, to propagate his doctrines. The master's\r\nprincipal propositions were even found one day in 1395, posted up on the\r\ndoor of St. Paul's Cathedral, in the heart of London. Among them figure\r\ndeclarations that, at a distance of three centuries, seem a\r\nforeshadowing of the theories of the Puritans; one for instance,\r\naffirming \"that the multitude of useless arts allowed in the kingdom are\r\nthe cause of sins without number.\" Among the forbidden arts are included\r\nthat of the goldsmiths, and another art of which, however, the Puritans\r\nwere to make a somewhat notorious use, that of the armorers.[739]\r\n\r\nAt the University, the followers of Wyclif were numerous; in the country\r\nthey continued to increase until the end of the fourteenth century.\r\nEnergetic measures were adopted in the beginning of the fifteenth; the\r\nstatute \"De haeretico comburendo\" was promulgated in 1401 (but rarely\r\napplied at this period); the master's books were condemned and\r\nprohibited; from that time Wyclifism declined, and traces of its\r\nsurvival can hardly be found at the period when the Reformation was\r\nintroduced into England.\r\n\r\nBy a strange fate Wyclif's posterity continued to flourish out of the\r\nkingdom. Bohemia had just given a queen to England, and used to send\r\nstudents every year from its University of Prague to study at Paris and\r\nOxford. In that country the Wyclifite tenets found a multitude of\r\nadepts; the Latin works of the thinker were transcribed by Czech\r\nstudents, and carried back to their own land; several writings of Wyclif\r\nexist only in Czech copies. His most illustrious disciple, John Hus,\r\nrector of the University of Prague, was burnt at the stake, by order of\r\nthe Council of Constance, on the 6th of July, 1415. But the doctrine\r\nsurvived; it was adopted with modifications by the Taborites and the\r\nMoravian Brethren, and borrowed from them by the Waldenses[740]; the\r\nsame Moravian Brethren who, owing to equally singular vicissitudes, were\r\nto become an important factor in the English religious movement of the\r\neighteenth century: the Wesleyan movement. In spite of differences in\r\ntheir doctrines, the Moravian Brethren and the Hussites stand as a\r\nconnecting link between Wesley and Wyclif.[741]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[666] \"Historia Anglicana,\" vol. i. pp. 453 ff.

This speech created a\r\ngreat stir; another analysis of it exists in the \"Chronicon Angliae\"\r\n(written by a monk of St. Albans, the abbot of which, Thomas de la Mare,\r\nsat in Parliament): \"Quae omnia ferret aequanimeter [plebs communis] si\r\ndominus rex noster sive regnum istud exinde aliquid commodi vel\r\nemolumenti sumpsisse videretur; etiam plebi tolerabile, si in\r\nexpediendis rebus bellicis, quamvis gestis minus prospere, tanta pecunia\r\nfuisset expensa.

Non enim est credible regem carere\r\ninfinita thesauri quantitate si fideles fuerint qui ministrant ei\" (p.\r\n73). The drift of the speech is, as may be seen, exactly the same as in\r\nthe Rolls of Parliament. Another specimen of pithy eloquence will be\r\nfound in the apostrophe addressed to the Earl of Stafford by John\r\nPhilpot, a mercer of London, after his naval feat of 1378. _Ibid._, p.\r\n200.\r\n\r\n[699] \"Rotuli Parliamentorum,\" ii. pp. 337 ff.\r\n\r\n[700] June 25, 1376.\r\n\r\n[701] The speech of this year was made \"en Engleis,\" by Simon, bishop of\r\nEly; but the Rolls give only a French version of it: \"Le prophet David\r\ndit que ...\" &c., vol. ii. p. 283.\r\n\r\n[702] \"Sires, I thank God, and yowe Spirituel and Temporal and alle the\r\nAstates of the lond; and do yowe to wyte, it es noght my will that no\r\nman thynk yt be waye of conquest I wold disherit any man of his\r\nheritage, franches, or other ryghtes that hym aght to have, no put hym\r\nout of that that he has and has had by the gude lawes and custumes of\r\nthe Rewme: Except thos persons that has ben agan the gude purpose and\r\nthe commune profyt of the Rewme.\" \"Rotuli Parliamentorum,\" vol. iii. p.\r\n423. In the fifteenth century the Parliamentary documents are written\r\nsometimes in French, sometimes in English; French predominates in the\r\nfirst half of the century, and English in the second.\r\n\r\n[703] On Wyclif's family, see \"The Birth and Parentage of Wyclif,\" by L.\r\nSergeant, _Athenaeum_, March 12 and 26, 1892.

(See above, p. 406.)\r\n\r\n[707] This extreme leniency caused an indignation of which an echo is\r\nfound in Walsingham: \"Oxoniense studium generale,\" he exclaims, \"quam\r\ngravi lapsu a sapientiae et scientiae culmine decidisti!...

Elsewhere, in\r\nanother series of unflattering epithets (\"old hypocrite,\" \"angel of\r\nSatan,\" &c.), the chronicler had allowed himself the pleasure of making\r\na little pun upon Wyclif's name: \"Non nominandus Joannes Wicliffe, vel\r\npotius Wykbeleve.\" Year 1381 vol. i. p. 450.\r\n\r\n[712] L.

The means\r\nformerly employed to amuse and raise a laugh cannot be expected to have\r\nshown much refinement. No refinement was to be found in them, and all\r\nmeans were considered good which ensured success; kicks were among the\r\nsimplest and oftenest resorted to, but not at all among the grossest;\r\nothers were worse, and were much more popular. Let us not wonder\r\novermuch: some of them have recovered again, quite recently, a part of\r\ntheir pristine popularity. They were used by jugglers or players,\r\n\"joculatores,\" nomadic sometimes, and sometimes belonging to the\r\nhousehold of the great. The existence of such men is testified to from\r\ncentury to century, during the whole of the Middle Ages, mainly by the\r\nblame and condemnation they constantly incurred: and so it is that the\r\nbest information concerning these men is not to be sought for in the\r\nmonuments of the gay literature, but rather in pious treatises and in\r\nthe acts of Councils.\r\n\r\nTreatises and Councils, however, might to our advantage have been even\r\nmore circumstantial; the pity is that they, naturally enough, consider\r\nit below their dignity to descend to very minute particulars; it is\r\nenough for them to give an enumeration, and to condemn in one phrase all\r\nthe mimes, tumblers, histrions, wrestlers, and the rest of the juggling\r\ntroup. Sometimes, however, a few particulars are added; the peculiar\r\ntricks and the scandalous practices of the ill-famed race are mentioned;\r\nand an idea can thus be formed of our ancestors' amusements. John of\r\nSalisbury in the twelfth century alludes to a variety of pastimes, and\r\nwhile protesting against the means used to produce laughter, places them\r\non record: a heavy laughter indeed, noisy and tumultuous, Rabelais'\r\nlaughter before Rabelais. Of course, \"such a modest hilarity as an\r\nhonest man would allow himself\" is not to be reproved, and John did not\r\nforbear to use this moderate way of enjoyment; but the case is different\r\nwith the jugglers and tumblers: \"much better it would be for them to do\r\nnothing than to act so wickedly.\"[742]\r\n\r\nNo doubt was possible. The jesters did not care in the least to keep\r\nwithin the bounds of \"a modest hilarity\"; nor did their audience, for in\r\nthe fourteenth century we find these men described in the poem of\r\nLangland, and they have not altered in any way[743]; their tricks are\r\nthe same, the same shameful exhibitions take place with the same\r\nsuccess; for two hundred years they have been laughed at without\r\nintermission. Many things have come and gone; the nation has got tired\r\nof John's tyranny, of Henry the Third's weakness, of the Pope's\r\nsupremacy, but the histrions continue to tumble and jump; \"their points\r\nbeing broken, down fall their hose,\" (to use Shakespeare's words), and\r\nthe great at Court are convulsed with laughter on their benches.\r\n\r\nBesides their horseplay, jugglers and histrions had, to please their\r\naudience, retorts, funny answers, witticisms, merry tales, which they\r\nacted rather than told, for gestures accompanied the delivery. This part\r\nof the amusement, which came nearest the drama, sharp repartees,\r\nimpromptu dialogues, is the one we know least about. Voices have long\r\nbeen silent, and the great halls which heard them are now but ivy-clad\r\nruins, yielding no echo. Some idea, however, can be formed of what took\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nFirst we know from innumerable testimonies that those histrions spoke\r\nand told endless nonsense; they have been often enough reproached with\r\nit for no doubt to remain as to their talking. Then there is\r\nsuperabundant proof of the relish with which men enjoyed, in the Middle\r\nAges, silly, teazing or puzzling answers; the questioner remaining at\r\nthe end rolled up in the repartees, gasping as a fly caught in a\r\nspider's web. The Court fool or buffoon had for his principal merit his\r\nclever knack of returning witty or confusing answers; the best of them\r\nwere preserved; itinerant minstrels remembered and repeated them;\r\nclerks turned them into Latin, and gave them place in their collections\r\nof _exempla_. They afforded amusement for a king, an amusement of a\r\nmixed sort, sometimes:\r\n\r\n--Why, says the king, are there no longer any Rolands?--Because, the\r\nfool answers, there are no longer any Charlemagnes.[744]\r\n\r\nWalter Map, as we saw, was so fond of happy answers that he formed a\r\nbook of all those he heard, knew, or made in his day. The fabliau of the\r\n\"Jongleur d'Ely,\" written in England in the thirteenth century, is a\r\ngood specimen of the word-fencing at which itinerant amusers were\r\nexpert. The king is unable to draw from the jongleur any answer to any\r\npurpose: What is his name?--The name of his father.--Whom does he belong\r\nto?--To his lord.--How is this river called?--No need to call it; it\r\ncomes of its own accord.--Does the jongleur's horse eat\r\nwell?--\"Certainly yes, my sweet good lord, he can eat more oats in a day\r\nthan you would do in a whole week.\"[745]\r\n\r\nThis is a mere sample of an art that lent itself to many uses, and to\r\nwhich belonged debates, \"estrifs,\" \"disputoisons,\" \"jeux-partis,\"\r\nequally popular in England and in France. Some specimens of it are as\r\nold as the time of the Anglo-Saxons, such as the \"Dialogue of Salomon\r\nand Saturnus.\"[746] There are found in the English language debates or\r\ndialogues between the Owl and Nightingale, thirteenth century; the\r\nThrush and Nightingale; the Fox and Wolf, time of Edward I.; the\r\nCarpenter's Tools, and others.[747] Collections of silly answers were\r\nalso made in England; one of them was composed to the confusion of the\r\ninhabitants of Norfolk; another in their honour and for their\r\ndefence.[748] The influence of those estrifs, or debates, on the\r\ndevelopment of the drama cannot be doubted; the oldest dramatic fragment\r\nin the English language is nothing but an estrif between Christ and\r\nSatan. The author acknowledges it himself:\r\n\r\n    A strif will I tellen on,\r\n\r\nsays he in his prologue.[749]\r\n\r\nDebates enjoyed great favour in castle halls; impromptu ones which, as\r\nCathos and Madelon said, centuries later, \"exercaient les esprits de\r\nl'assemblee,\" were greatly liked; they constituted a sort of society\r\ngame, one of the oldest on record. A person among those present was\r\nchosen to answer questions, and the amusement consisted in putting or\r\nreturning questions and answers of the most unexpected or puzzling\r\ncharacter. This was called the game of the \"King who does not lie,\" or\r\nthe game of the \"King and Queen.\"[750] By a phenomenon which has been\r\nobserved in less remote periods, after-dinner conversations often took a\r\nlicentious turn; in those games love was the subject most willingly\r\ndiscussed, and it was not as a rule treated from a very ethereal point\r\nof view; young men and young ladies exchanged on those occasions\r\nobservations the liberty of which gave umbrage to the Church, who tried\r\nto interfere; bishops in their Constitutions mentioned those amusements,\r\nand forbade to their flock such unbecoming games as \"ludos de Rege et\r\nRegina;\" Walter de Chanteloup, bishop of Worcester, did so in 1240.[751]\r\nSome of that freedom of speech survived, however, through the Middle\r\nAges up to the time of Shakespeare; while listening to the dialogues of\r\nBeatrix and Benedick one wonders sometimes whether they are not playing\r\nthe game \"de Rege et Regina.\"\r\n\r\nParody also helped in its way to the formation of the drama. There was a\r\ntaste for masking, for the imitation of other people; for the\r\ncaricaturing of some grave person or of some imposing ceremony, mass\r\nfor example, for the reproduction of the song of birds or the noise of a\r\nstorm, gestures being added to the noise, the song, or the words. Some\r\njugglers excelled in this; they were live gargoyles and were paid \"the\r\none to play the drunkard, another the fool, a third to imitate the cat.\"\r\nThe great minstrels, \"grans menestreus,\" had a horror of those\r\ngargoyles, the shame of their profession;[752] noblemen, however, did\r\nnot share these refined, if not disinterested, feelings, and asked to\r\ntheir castles and freely rewarded the members of the wandering tribe who\r\nknew how to imitate the drunkard, the fool, or the cat.\r\n\r\nOn histrionic liberties introduced even into church services, Aelred,\r\nabbot of Rievaulx in the twelfth century, gives some unexpected\r\nparticulars. He describes the movements and attitudes of certain\r\nchanters by which they \"resembled actors\": so that we thus get\r\ninformation on both at the same time. Chanters are found in various\r\nchurches, he says, who with inflated cheeks imitate the noise of\r\nthunder, and then murmur, whisper, allow their voice to expire, keeping\r\ntheir mouth open, and think that they give thus an idea of the death or\r\necstasy of martyrs. Now you would think you hear the neighing of horses,\r\nnow the voice of a woman. With this \"all their body is agitated by\r\nhistrionic movements\"; their lips, their shoulders, their fingers are\r\ntwisted, shrugged, or spread out as they think best to suit their\r\ndelivery. The audience, filled with wonder and admiration at those\r\ninordinate gesticulations, at length bursts into laughter: \"It seems to\r\nthem they are at the play and not at church, and that they have only to\r\nlook and not to pray.\"[753]\r\n\r\nThe transition from these various performances to little dramas or\r\ninterludes, which were at first nothing but tales turned into dialogues,\r\nwas so natural that it could scarcely attract any notice. Few specimens\r\nhave survived; one English one, however, is extant, dating from the time\r\nof Edward I., and shows that this transition had then taken place. It\r\nconsists in the dramatising of one of the most absurd and most popular\r\ntales told by wandering minstrels, the story, namely, of the Weeping\r\nBitch. A woman or maid rejects the love of a clerk; an old woman (Dame\r\nSiriz in the English prose text) calls upon the proud one, having in her\r\nhands a little bitch whom she has fed with mustard, and whose eyes\r\naccordingly weep. The bitch, she says, is her own daughter, so\r\ntransformed by a clerk who had failed to touch her heart; the young\r\nwoman at once yields to her lover, fearing a similar fate. There exist\r\nFrench, Latin, and English versions of this tale, one of the few which\r\nare of undoubted Hindu origin. The English version seems to belong to\r\nthe thirteenth century.[754]\r\n\r\nThe turning of it into a drama took place a few years later. Nothing was\r\neasier; this fabliau, like many others, was nearly all in dialogues; to\r\nmake a play of it, the jongleur had but to suppress some few lines of\r\nnarrative; we thus have a drama, in rudimentary shape, where a deep\r\nstudy of human feelings must not be sought for.[755] Here is the\r\nconversation between the young man and the young maid when they meet:\r\n\r\n    _Clericus._ Damishel, reste wel.\r\n\r\n    _Puella._   Sir, welcum, by Saynt Michel!\r\n\r\n    _Clericus._ Wer esty (is thy) sire, wer esty dame?\r\n\r\n    _Puella._   By Gode, es noner her at hame.\r\n\r\n    _Clericus._ Wel wor suile (such) a man to life\r\n                That suile a may (maid) mihte have to wyfe!\r\n\r\n    _Puella._   Do way, by Crist and Leonard....\r\n                Go forth thi way, god sire,\r\n                For her hastu losye al thi wile.\r\n\r\nAfter some more supplications, the clerk, who is a student at the\r\nUniversity, goes to old Helwis (Siriz in the prose tale) and then the\r\nauthor, more accustomed, it seems, to such persons than to the company\r\nof young maidens, describes with some art the hypocrisy of the matron.\r\nHelwis will not; she leads a holy life, and what is asked of her will\r\ndisturb her from her pious observances. Her dignified scruples are\r\nremoved at length by the plain offer of a reward.\r\n\r\nIn this way, some time before Chaucer's birth, the lay drama came into\r\nexistence in Shakespeare's country.\r\n\r\nOther stories of the same sort were also turned into plays; we have none\r\nof them, but we know that they existed. An Englishman of the fourteenth\r\ncentury calls the performance of them \"pleyinge of japis,\"[756] by\r\nopposition to the performance of religious dramas.\r\n\r\nOther amusements again, of a strange kind, helped in the same early\r\nperiod to the formation of the drama. A particularly keen pleasure was\r\nafforded during the Middle Ages by songs, dances, and carols, when\r\nperformed in consecrated places, such as cemeteries, cloisters,\r\nchurches. A preference for such places may seem scarcely credible; still\r\nit cannot be doubted, and is besides easily explainable. To the\r\nunbridled instincts of men as yet half tamed, the Church had opposed\r\nrigorous prescriptions which were enforced wholesale. To resist\r\nexcessive independence, excessive severity was needful; buttresses had\r\nto be raised equal in strength to the weight of the wall. But from time\r\nto time a cleft was formed, and the loosened passions burst forth with\r\nviolence. Escaped from the bondage of discipline, men found\r\ninexpressible delight in violating all prohibitions at once; the day\r\nfor the beast had come, and it challenged the angel in its turn.\r\n\r\nThe propelling power of passions so repressed was even increased by\r\ncertain weird tastes very common at that period, and by the merry\r\nreactions they caused. Now oppressed by, and now in revolt against, the\r\nidea of death, the faithful would at times answer threats with sneers;\r\nthey found a particular pleasure in evolving bacchanalian processions\r\namong the tombs of churchyards, not only because it was forbidden, but\r\nalso on account of the awful character of the place. The watching of the\r\ndead was also an occasion for orgies and laughter. At the University,\r\neven, these same amusements were greatly liked; students delighted in\r\nsinging licentious songs, wearing wreaths, carolling and deep drinking\r\nin the midst of churchyards. Councils, popes, and bishops never tired of\r\nprotesting, nor the faithful of dancing. Be it forbidden, says Innocent\r\nIII. at the beginning of the thirteenth century, to perform \"theatrical\r\ngames\" in churches. Be this prohibition enforced, says Gregory IX. a\r\nlittle later.[757] Be it forbidden, says Walter de Chanteloup, bishop of\r\nWorcester, to perform \"dishonest games\" in cemeteries and churches,\r\nespecially on feast days and on the vigils of saints.[758] Be it\r\nforbidden, says the provincial council of Scotland in 1225, \"to carol\r\nand sing songs at the funeral of the dead; the tears of others ought not\r\nto be an occasion for laughter.\"[759] Be it forbidden, the University\r\nof Oxford decrees in the same century, to dance and sing in churches,\r\nand wear there disguises and wreaths of flowers and leaves.[760]\r\n\r\nThe year was divided by feasts; and those feasts, the importance of\r\nwhich in everybody's eyes has dwindled much, were then great events;\r\npeople thought of them long before, saw them in the distance, towering\r\nabove the common level of days, as cathedrals above houses Everyday life\r\nwas arrested, and it was a time for rejoicings, of a religious, and\r\nsometimes of an impious, character: both kinds helped the formation of\r\ndrama, and they were at times closely united On such great occasions,\r\nmore than ever, the caricature and derision of holy things increased the\r\namusement. Christmas-time had inherited the licence as well as it\r\noccupied the date of the ancient Roman saturnalia; and whatever be the\r\nperiod considered, be it early or late in the Middle Ages, it will be\r\nfound that the anniversary was commemorated, piously and merrily, by\r\nsneering and adoring multitudes For the one did not prevent the other;\r\npeople caricatured the Church, her hierarchy and ceremonials, but did\r\nnot doubt her infallibility; they laughed at the devil and feared him.\r\n\"Priests, deacons, and sub-deacons,\" says the Pope, are bold enough, on\r\nthose mad days, \"to take part in unbecoming bacchanals, in the presence\r\nof the people, whom they ought rather to edify by preaching the Word of\r\nGod.\"[761] In those bacchanals parodies of the Church prayers were\r\nintroduced; a Latin hymn on the Nativity was transposed line for line,\r\nand became a song in honour of the good ale. Here, as a sample, are two\r\nstanzas, both of the original and of the parody, this last having, as it\r\nseems, been composed in England:\r\n\r\n      Letabundus\r\n    Exultet fidelis chorus,\r\n      Alleluia!\r\n      Regem Regum\r\n    Intacte perfundit thorus:\r\n      Res miranda!\r\n\r\n    Angelus consilii\r\n    Natus est de Virgine,\r\n      Sol de Stella,\r\n    Sol occasum nesciens,\r\n    Stella semper rutilans,\r\n      Semper clara.\r\n\r\n      Or i parra:\r\n    La Cerveise nos chantera\r\n      _Alleluia!_\r\n      Qui que en beit,\r\n    Se tele seit com estre deit,\r\n      _Res miranda!_\r\n\r\n    Bevez quant l'avez en poing;\r\n    Bien est droit, car mout est loing\r\n      _Sol de Stella_;\r\n    Bevez bien et bevez bel,\r\n    El vos vendra del tonel\r\n      _Semper clara_.\r\n\r\n\"You will see; the ale will make us sing, Alleluia! all of us, if the\r\nale is as it should be, a wonderful thing! (Res miranda). Drink of it\r\nwhen you hold the jug; 'tis a most proper thing, for it is a good long\r\nway from sun to star (Sol de Stella); drink well! drink deep! it will\r\nflow for you from the tun, ever clear! (Semper clara).\"[762]\r\n\r\nSo rose from earth at Christmastide, borne on the same winds, angels\r\nand demons, and the ancient feast of Saturn was commemorated at the same\r\ntime as Christ's. In the same way, again, the scandalous feasts of the\r\nFools, of the Innocents, and of the Ass, were made the merrier with\r\ngrotesque parodies of pious ceremonies; they were celebrated in the\r\nchurch itself, thus transformed, says the bishop of Lincoln, Robert\r\nGrosseteste, into a place for pleasure, amusement, and folly: God's\r\nhouse was defiled by the devil's inventions. He forbade, in consequence,\r\nthe celebration of the feast of Fools, \"festum Stultorum,\" on the day of\r\nCircumcision in his cathedral, and then in the whole diocese.[763]\r\n\r\nThe feast of the Innocents was even more popular in England. The\r\nperformers had at their head a \"boy bishop,\" and this diminutive prelate\r\npresided, with mitre on his head, over the frolics of his madcap\r\ncompanions. The king would take an interest in the ceremony; he would\r\norder the little dignitary to be brought before him, and give him a\r\npresent. Edward II. gave six shillings and eight pence to the young\r\nJohn, son of Allan Scroby, who had played the part of the \"boy bishop\"\r\nin the royal chapel; another time he gave ten shillings; Richard II.,\r\nmore liberal, gave a pound.[764] Nuns even were known to forget on\r\ncertain occasions their own character, and to carol with laymen on the\r\nday of the Innocents, or on the day of Mary Magdalen, to commemorate the\r\nlife of their patroness, in its first part as it seems.[765]\r\n\r\nThe passion for sightseeing, which was then very keen, and which was to\r\nbe fed, later, mainly on theatrical entertainments, was indulged in\r\nduring the Middle Ages in various other ways. Processions were one of\r\nthem; occasions were numerous, and causes for them were not difficult to\r\nfind. Had the _Pui_ of London awarded the crown to the writer of the\r\nbest _chanson_, a procession was formed in the streets in honour of the\r\nevent. A marriage, a pilgrimage to Palestine, a patronal feast, were\r\nsufficient motives; gilds and associations donned their liveries, drew\r\ntheir insignia from their chest, and paraded the streets, including in\r\nthe \"pageant,\" when the circumstance allowed of it, a medley of giants\r\nand dwarfs, monsters, gilt fishes, and animals of all sorts. On grand\r\ndays the town itself was transformed; with its flower-decked houses, its\r\ntapestries and hangings, it gave, with some more realism about it, the\r\nimpression we receive from the painted scenery of an opera.\r\n\r\nThe town at such times was swept with extraordinary care; even\r\n\"insignificant filth\" was removed, Matthew Paris notes with wondering\r\npen in 1236.[766] The procession moved forward, men on horseback and on\r\nfoot, with unfurled banners, along the decorated streets, to the sound\r\nof bells ringing in the steeples. At road-crossings the procession\r\nstopped; after having been a sight, the members of it became in their\r\nturn sightseers. Wonders had been prepared to please them: here a forest\r\nwith wild beasts and St. John the Baptist; elsewhere scenes from the\r\nBible, or from knightly romances, the \"pas de Saladin,\" for example,\r\nwhere the champion of England, Richard Coeur-de-Lion, fought the\r\nchampion of Islam. At times it was a dumb-show, a sort of _tableau\r\nvivant_, at others actors moved but did not speak; at others again they\r\ndid both, and complimented the king. A day came when the compliments\r\nwere cut into dialogues; such practice was frequent in the fifteenth\r\ncentury, and it approached very near to the real drama.\r\n\r\nIn 1236, Henry III. of England having married Alienor of Provence made\r\nhis solemn entry into his capital. On this occasion were gathered\r\ntogether \"so many nobles, so many ecclesiastics, such a concourse of\r\npeople, such a quantity of histrions, that the town of London could\r\nscarcely hold them in her ample bosom--_sinu suo capace_.--All the town\r\nwas adorned with silk banners, wreaths, hangings, candles and lamps,\r\nmechanisms and inventions of extraordinary kinds.\"[767]\r\n\r\nThe same town, fond above all others of such exhibitions, and one of the\r\nlast to preserve vestiges of them in her Lord Mayor's Show, outdid all\r\nthat had been seen before when, on the 29th of August, 1393, Richard II.\r\nmade his entry in state, after having consented to receive the citizens\r\nagain into his favour.[768] The streets were lined with cloth of gold\r\nand purple; \"sweet smelling flowers\" perfumed the air; tapestries with\r\nfigures hung from the windows; the king was coming forth, splendid to\r\nlook at, very proud of his good looks, \"much like Troilus;\" queen Anne\r\ntook part also in the procession. A variety of scenes stop the progress\r\nand delight the onlookers; one had an unforeseen character. The queen\r\nwas nearing the gate of the bridge, the old bridge with defensive towers\r\nand gates, and two cars full of ladies were following her, when one of\r\nthe cars, \"of Phaetonic make\" says the classical-minded narrator,\r\nsuddenly broke. Grave as saints, beautiful as angels, the ladies, losing\r\ntheir balance, fell head downwards; and the crowd, while full of\r\nadmiration for what they saw, \"could not suppress their laughter.\" The\r\nauthor of the description calls it, as Fragonard would have done, \"a\r\nlucky chance,\" _sors bona_; but there was nothing of Fragonard in him\r\nexcept this word: he was a Carmelite and Doctor of Divinity.\r\n\r\nThings having been set right again, the procession entered Cheapside,\r\nand there was seen an \"admirable tower\"; a young man and a young maiden\r\ncame out of it, addressed Richard and Anne, and offered them crowns; at\r\nthe Gate of St. Paul's a concert of music was heard; at Temple Bar,\r\n\"barram Templi,\" a forest had been arranged on the gate, with animals of\r\nall sorts, serpents, lions, a bear, a unicorn, an elephant, a beaver, a\r\nmonkey, a tiger, a bear, \"all of which were there, running about, biting\r\neach other, fighting, jumping.\" Forests and beasts were supposed to\r\nrepresent the desert where St. John the Baptist had lived. An angel was\r\nlet down from the roof, and offered the king and queen a little diptych\r\nin gold, with stones and enamel representing the Crucifixion; he made\r\nalso a speech. At length the queen, who had an active part to play in\r\nthis opera, came forward, and, owing to her intercession, the king, with\r\ndue ceremony, consented to bestow his pardon on the citizens.\r\n\r\nMany other examples might be adduced; feasts were numerous, and for a\r\ntime caused pains to be forgotten: \"oubliance etait au voir,\" as\r\nFroissart says so well on an occasion of this sort.[769] There were also\r\nfor the people the May celebrations with their dances and songs, the\r\nimpersonation of Robin Hood, later the performance of short plays of\r\nwhich he was the hero[770]; and again those chimes, falling from the\r\nsteeples, filling the air with their joyous peals. At Court there were\r\nthe \"masks\" or \"ballets\" in which the great took part, wrapped in starry\r\ndraperies, disguised with gold beards, dressed in skins or feathers, as\r\nwere at Paris King Charles VI. and his friends on the 29th of January,\r\n1392, in the famous Ballet of Wild Men, since called, from the\r\ncatastrophe which happened, \"Ballet des Ardents\" (of men in fire). The\r\ntaste for ballets and Masks was one of long duration; the Tudors and\r\nStuarts were as fond of them as the Plantagenets, so much so that a\r\nbranch apart in dramatic literature was created on this account, and it\r\nincludes in England such graceful and touching masterpieces as the \"Sad\r\nShepherd\" of Ben Jonson and the \"Comus\" of Milton.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nWhile histrions and amusers give a foretaste of farce and comedy in\r\ncastle halls, while romantic drama is foreshadowed in the \"pas de\r\nSaladin\" and the \"Taking of Troy,\" and the pastoral drama begins with\r\nMay games, other sources of the modern dramatic art were springing up in\r\nthe shadow of the cloister and under the naves of churches.\r\n\r\nThe imitation of any action is a step towards drama. Conventional,\r\nliturgical, ritualistic as the imitation was, still there was an\r\nimitation in the ceremony of mass; and mass led to the religious drama,\r\nwhich was therefore, at starting, as conventional, liturgical, and\r\nritualistic as could be. Its early beginning is to be sought for in the\r\nantiphoned parts of the service, and then it makes one with the service\r\nitself. In a similar manner, outside the Church lay drama had begun with\r\nthe alternate _chansons_, debates, poetical altercations of the singers\r\nof facetious or love-songs. A great step was made when, at the principal\r\nfeasts of the year, Easter and Christmas, the chanters, instead of\r\ngiving their responses from their stalls, moved in the Church to recall\r\nthe action commemorated on that day; additions were introduced into the\r\nreceived text of the service; religious drama begins then to have an\r\nexistence of its own.\r\n\r\n\"'Tell us, shepherds, whom do you seek in this stable?--They will\r\nanswer: 'Christ the Saviour, our Lord.'\"[771]\r\n\r\nSuch is the starting-point; it dates from the tenth century; from this\r\nis derived the play of Shepherds, of which many versions have come down\r\nto us. One of them, followed in the cathedral of Rouen, gives a minute\r\naccount of the performance as it was then acted in the midst of the\r\nreligious service: \"Be the crib established behind the altar, and be the\r\nimage of the Blessed Mary placed there. First a child, from before the\r\nchoir and on a raised platform, representing an angel, will announce the\r\nbirth of the Saviour to five canons or their vicars of the second rank;\r\nthe shepherds must come in by the great gate of the choir.... As they\r\nnear the crib they sing the prose _Pax in terris_. Two priests of the\r\nfirst rank, wearing a dalmatic, will represent the midwives and stand by\r\nthe crib.\"[772]\r\n\r\nThese adventitious ornaments were greatly appreciated, and from year to\r\nyear they were increased and perfected. Verse replaced prose; the\r\nvulgar idiom replaced Latin; open air and the public square replaced the\r\nchurch nave and its subdued light. It was no longer necessary to have\r\nrecourse to priests wearing a dalmatic in order to represent midwives;\r\nthe feminine parts were performed by young boys dressed as women: this\r\nwas coming much nearer nature, as near in fact as Shakespeare did, for\r\nhe never saw any but boys play the part of his Juliet. There were even\r\ncases in which actual women were seen on the mediaeval stage. Those\r\nameliorations, so simple and obvious, summed up in a phrase, were the\r\nwork of centuries, but the tide when once on the flow was the stronger\r\nfor waiting. The drama left the church, because its increased importance\r\nhad made it cumbersome there, because it was badly seen, and because\r\nhaving power it wanted freedom.\r\n\r\nEaster was the occasion for ornaments and additions similar to those\r\nintroduced into the Christmas service.[773] The ceremonies of Holy Week,\r\nwhich reproduced each incident in the drama of the Passion, lent\r\nthemselves admirably to it. Additions following additions, the whole of\r\nthe Old Testament ended by being grouped round and tied to the Christmas\r\nfeast, and the whole of the New Testament round Easter. Both were\r\nclosely connected, the scenes in the one being interpreted as symbols of\r\nthe scenes in the other; complete cycles were thus formed, representing\r\nin two divisions the religious history of mankind from the Creation to\r\nDoomsday. Once severed from the church, these groups of plays often got\r\nalso separated from the feast to which they owed their birth, and were\r\nrepresented at Whitsuntide, on Corpus Christi day, or on the occasion\r\nof some solemnity or other.\r\n\r\nAs the taste for such dramas was spreading, a variety of tragical\r\nsubjects, not from the Bible, were turned into dialogues: first lives of\r\nsaints, later, in France, some few subjects borrowed from history or\r\nromance: the story of Griselda, the raising of the siege at Orleans by\r\nJoan of Arc, &c.[774] The English adhered more exclusively to the Bible.\r\nDramas drawn from the lives of saints were usually called Miracles;\r\nthose derived from the Bible, Mysteries; but these appellations had\r\nnothing very definite about them, and were often used one for the other.\r\n\r\nThe religious drama was on the way to lose its purely liturgical\r\ncharacter when the conquest of England had taken place. Under the reign\r\nof the Norman and Angevin kings, the taste for dramatic performances\r\nincreased considerably; within the first century after Hastings we find\r\nthem numerous and largely attended.\r\n\r\nThe oldest representation the memory of which has come down to us took\r\nplace at the beginning of the twelfth century, and had for its subject\r\nthe story of that St. Catherine of Alexandria whom the Emperor Maximinus\r\ncaused to be beheaded after she had converted the fifty orators\r\nentrusted with the care of bringing her back to paganism by dint of\r\ntheir eloquence. The fifty orators received baptism, and were burnt\r\nalive.[775] The representation was managed by a Mancel of good family\r\ncalled Geoffrey, whom Richard, abbot of St. Albans, had asked to come\r\nfrom France to be the master of the Abbey school. But as he was late in\r\nstarting, he found on his coming that the school had been given to\r\nanother; in his leisure he caused to be represented at Dunstable a play,\r\nor miracle, of St. Catherine, \"quendam ludum de Sancta Katerina quem\r\nmiracula vulgariter appellamus.\" He borrowed from the sacristan at St.\r\nAlbans the Abbey copes to dress his actors in; but the night following\r\nupon the performance, the fire consumed his house; all his books were\r\nburnt, and the copes too: \"Wherefore, not knowing how to indemnify God\r\nand St. Albans, he offered his own person as a holocaust and took the\r\nhabit in the monastery. This explains the zeal with which, having become\r\nabbot, he strove to enrich the convent with precious copes.\" For he\r\nbecame abbot, and died in 1146, after a reign of twenty-six years,[776]\r\nand Matthew Paris, to whom we owe those details, and whose taste for\r\nworks of art is well known, gives a full enumeration of the splendid\r\npurple and gold vestments, adorned with precious stones, with which the\r\nMancel Geoffrey enriched the treasury of the Abbey.[777]\r\n\r\nA little later in the same century, Fitzstephen, who wrote under Henry\r\nII., mentions as a common occurrence the \"representations of miracles\"\r\nheld in London.[778] In the following century, under Henry III., some\r\nwere written in the English language.[779] During the fourteenth\r\ncentury, in the time of Chaucer, mysteries were at the height of their\r\npopularity; their heroes were familiar to all, and the sayings of the\r\nsame became proverbs. Kings themselves journeyed in order to be present\r\nat the representations; Chaucer had seen them often, and the characters\r\nin his tales make frequent allusions to them; his drunken miller cries\r\n\"in Pilates vois\"; \"Jolif Absolon\" played the part of \"king Herodes,\"\r\nand is it to be expected that an Alisoun could resist king Herodes? The\r\nWife of Bath, dressed in her best garments, goes \"to pleyes of\r\nmiracles,\" and there tries to make acquaintances that may be turned into\r\nhusbands when she wants them. \"Hendy Nicholas\" quotes to the credulous\r\ncarpenter the example of Noah, whose wife would not go on board, and who\r\nregretted that he had not built a separate ship for \"hir-self allone.\"\r\n\r\nA treatise, written in English at this period, against such\r\nrepresentations, shows the extreme favour in which they stood with all\r\nclasses of society.[780] The enthusiasm was so general and boundless\r\nthat it seems to the author indispensable to take the field and retort\r\n(for the question was keenly disputed) the arguments put forward to\r\njustify the performance of mysteries. The works and miracles of Christ,\r\nhe observes, were not done for play; He did them \"ernystfully,\" and we\r\nuse them \"in bourde and pleye!\" It is treating with great familiarity\r\nthe Almighty, who may well say: \"Pley not with me, but pley with thi\r\npere.\" Let us beware of His revenge; it well may happen that \"God takith\r\nmore venjaunce on us than a lord that sodaynly sleeth his servaunt for\r\nhe pleyide to homely with hym;\" and yet the lord's vengeance cannot be\r\nconsidered a trifling one.\r\n\r\nWhat do the abettors of mysteries answer to this? They answer that \"thei\r\npleyen these myraclis in the worschip of God\"; they lead men to think\r\nand meditate; devils are seen there carrying the wicked away to hell;\r\nthe sufferings of Christ are represented, and the hardest are touched,\r\nthey are seen weeping for pity; for people wept and laughed at the\r\nrepresentations, openly and noisily, \"wepynge bitere teris.\" Besides,\r\nthere are men of different sorts, and some are so made that they cannot\r\nbe converted but by mirthful means, \"by gamen and pley\"; and such\r\nperformances do them much good. Must not, on the other hand, all men\r\nhave \"summe recreatioun\"? Better it is, \"or lesse yvele, that thei han\r\nthyre recreacoun by pleyinge of myraclis than bi pleyinge of other\r\njapis.\" And one more very sensible reason is given: \"Sithen it is\r\nleveful to han the myraclis of God peyntid, why is not as wel leveful to\r\nhan the myraclis of God pleyed ... and betere thei ben holden in mennus\r\nmynde and oftere rehersid by the pleyinge of hem than by the peyntynge,\r\nfor this is a deed bok, the tother a quick.\"\r\n\r\nTo those reasons, which he does not try to conceal, but on the contrary\r\npresents very forcibly, the fair-minded author answers his best. These\r\nrepresentations are too amusing; after such enjoyments, everyday life\r\nseems plain and dull; women of \"yvil continaunse,\" Wives of Bath maybe,\r\nor worse, flock there and do not remain idle. The fact that they come\r\ndoes not prevent the priests from going too; yet it is \"uttirly\"\r\nforbidden them \"not onely to been myracle pleyere but also to heren or\r\nto seen myraclis pleyinge.\" But they set the decree at nought and \"pleyn\r\nin entirlodies,\" and go and see them: \"The prestis that seyn hemsilf\r\nholy, and besien hem aboute siche pleyis, ben verry ypocritis and\r\nlyeris.\" All bounds have been overstepped; it is no longer a taste, but\r\na passion; men are carried away by it; citizens become avaricious and\r\ngrasping to get money in view of the representations and the amusements\r\nwhich follow: \"To peyen ther rente and ther dette thei wolen grucche,\r\nand to spende two so myche upon ther pley thei wolen nothinge grucche.\"\r\nMerchants and tradesmen \"bygilen ther neghbors, in byinge and sellyng,\"\r\nthat is \"hideous coveytise,\" that is \"maumetrie\"; and they do it \"to han\r\nto spenden on these miraclis.\"\r\n\r\nMany documents corroborate these statements and show the accuracy of the\r\ndescription. The fondness of priests for plays and similar pastimes is\r\ndescanted upon by the Council of London in 1391.[781] A hundred years\r\nearlier an Englishman, in a poem which he wrote in French, had pointed\r\nout exactly the same abuses: from which can be perceived how deeply\r\nrooted they were. Another folly, William de Wadington[782] had said, has\r\nbeen invented by mad clerks; it consists in what is called Miracles; in\r\nspite of decrees they disguise themselves with masks, \"li forsene!\"[783]\r\nPurely liturgical drama, of course, is permissible (an additional proof\r\nof its existence in England); certain representations can be held,\r\n\"provided they be chastely set up and included in the Church service,\"\r\nas is done when the burial of Christ or the Resurrection is represented\r\n\"to increase devotion.\"[784] But to have \"those mad gatherings in the\r\nstreets of towns, or in the cemeteries, after dinner,\" to prepare for\r\nthe idle such meeting-places, is a quite different thing; if they tell\r\nyou that they do it with good intent and to the honour of God, do not\r\nbelieve them; it is all \"for the devil.\" If players ask you to lend them\r\nhorses, equipments, dresses, and ornaments of all sorts, don't fail to\r\nrefuse. For the stage continued to live upon loans, and the example of\r\nthe copes of St. Albans destroyed by fire had not deterred convents from\r\ncontinuing to lend sacred vestments to actors.[785] In the case of\r\nsacred vestments, says William, \"the sin is much greater.\" In all this,\r\nas well as in all sorts of dances and frolics, a heavy responsibility\r\nrests with the minstrels; they ply a dangerous trade, a \"trop perilus\r\nmester\"; they cause God to be forgotten, and the vanity of the world to\r\nbe cherished.\r\n\r\nNot a few among these English dramas, so popular in former days, have\r\ncome down to us. Besides separate pieces, histories of saints (very\r\nscarce in England), or fragments of old series, several collections have\r\nsurvived, the property whilom of gilds or municipalities. A number of\r\ntowns kept up those shows, which attracted visitors, and were at the\r\nsame time edifying, profitable, and amusing. From the fourteenth century\r\nthe performances were in most cases intrusted to the gilds, each craft\r\nhaving as much as possible to represent a play in accordance with its\r\nparticular trade. Shipwrights represented the building of the ark;\r\nfishermen, the Flood; goldsmiths, the coming of the three kings with\r\ntheir golden crowns; wine merchants, the marriage at Cana, where a\r\nmiracle took place very much in their line. In other cases the plays\r\nwere performed by gilds founded especially for that purpose: gild of\r\nCorpus Christi, of the Pater Noster, &c. This last had been created\r\nbecause \"once on a time, a play setting forth the goodness of the Lord's\r\nPrayer was played in the city of York, in which play all manner of vices\r\nand sins were held up to scorn and the virtues were held up to praise.\r\nThis play met with such favour that many said: 'Would that this play\r\ncould be kept in this city, for the health of souls and for the comfort\r\nof citizens and neighbours!' Hence the keeping up of that play in times\r\nto come\" (year 1389).[786]\r\n\r\nIn a more or less complete state, the collections of the Mysteries\r\nperformed at Chester, Coventry, Woodkirk, and York have been preserved,\r\nwithout speaking of fragments of other series. Most of those texts\r\nbelong to the fourteenth century, but have been retouched at a later\r\ndate.[787] Old Mysteries did not escape the hand of the improvers, any\r\nmore than old churches, where any one who pleased added paintings,\r\nporches, and tracery, according to the fashion of the day.\r\n\r\nThese dramatic entertainments, which thrilled a whole town, to which\r\nflocked, with equal zeal, peasants and craftsmen, citizens, noblemen,\r\nkings and queens, which the Reformation succeeded in killing only after\r\nhalf a century's fight, enlivened with incomparable glow the monotonous\r\ncourse of days and weeks. The occasion was a solemn one; preparation was\r\nbegun long beforehand; it was an important affair, an affair of State.\r\nGilds taxed their members to secure a fair representation of the play\r\nassigned to them; they were fined by the municipal authority in case\r\nthey proved careless and inefficient, or were behind their time to\r\nbegin.\r\n\r\nRead as they are, without going back in our minds to times past and\r\ntaking into account the circumstances of their composition, Mysteries\r\nmay well be judged a gross, childish, and barbarous production. Still,\r\nthey are worthy of great attention, as showing a side of the soul of our\r\nancestors, who in all this did _their very best_: for those performances\r\nwere not got up anyhow: they were the result of prolonged care and\r\nattention. Not any man who wished was accepted as an actor; some\r\nexperience of the art was expected; and in some towns even examinations\r\ntook place. At York a decree of the Town Council ordains that long\r\nbefore the appointed day, \"in the tyme of lentyn\" (while the performance\r\nitself took place in summer, at the Corpus Christi celebration) \"there\r\nshall be called afore the maire for the tyme beyng four of the moste\r\nconnyng discrete and able players within this Citie, to serche, here and\r\nexamen all the plaiers and plaies and pagentes thrughoute all the\r\nartificers belonging to Corpus Christi plaie. And all suche as thay\r\nshall fynde sufficiant in personne and connyng, to the honour of the\r\nCitie and worship of the saide craftes, for to admitte and able; and all\r\nother insufficiant personnes, either in connyng, voice, or personne to\r\ndischarge, ammove and avoide.\" All crafts were bound to bring \"furthe\r\nther pageantez in order and course by good players, well arayed and\r\nopenly spekyng, upon payn of lesying 100 s. to be paide to the chambre\r\nwithout any pardon.\"[788] These texts belong to the fifteenth century,\r\nbut there are older ones; and they show that from the beginning the\r\ndifference between good and bad actors was appreciated and great\r\nimportance was attached to the gestures and delivery. The Mystery of\r\n\"Adam\" (in French, the work, it seems, of a Norman), which belongs to\r\nthe twelfth century, commences with recommendations to players: \"Be Adam\r\nwell trained so as to answer at the appropriate time without any\r\nslackness or haste. The same with the other actors; let them speak in\r\nsedate fashion, with gestures fitting the words; be they mindful not to\r\nadd or suppress a syllable in the verses; and be their pronunciation\r\nconstantly clear.\"[789] The amusement afforded by such exhibitions, the\r\npersonal fame acquired by good actors, suddenly drawn from the shadow in\r\nwhich their working lives had been spent till then, acted so powerfully\r\non craftsmen that some would not go back to the shop, and, leaving their\r\ntools behind them, became professional actors; thus showing that there\r\nwas some wisdom in the reproof set forth in the \"Tretise of Miraclis\r\npleyinge.\"\r\n\r\nOnce emerged from the Church, the drama had the whole town in which to\r\ndisplay itself; and it filled the whole town. On these days the city\r\nbelonged to dramatic art; each company had its cars or scaffolds,\r\n_pageants_ (placed on wheels in some towns), each car being meant to\r\nrepresent one of the places where the events in the play happened. The\r\ncomplete series of scenes was exhibited at the main crossings, or on the\r\nprincipal squares or open spaces in the town. The inhabitants of\r\nneighbouring houses sat thus as in a front row, and enjoyed a most\r\nenviable privilege, so enviable that it was indeed envied, and at York,\r\nfor example, they had to pay for it. After 1417 the choosing of the\r\nplaces for the representations was regulated by auction, and the plays\r\nwere performed under the windows of the highest bidders. In other cases\r\nthe scaffolds were fixed; so that the representation was performed only\r\nat one place.\r\n\r\nThe form of the scaffolds varied from town to town. At Chester \"these\r\npagiantes or cariage was a highe place made like a house with two rowmes\r\nbeinge open on ye tope: the lower rowme they apparrelled and dressed\r\nthem selves; and in the higher rowme they played: and they stoode upon\r\nsix wheeles. And when they had done with one cariage in one place, they\r\nwheeled the same from one streete to an other.\"[790] In some cases the\r\nscaffolds were not so high, and boards made a communication between the\r\nraised platform and the ground; a horseman could thus ride up the\r\nscaffold: \"Here Erode ragis in the pagond and in the strete also.\"[791]\r\n\r\nSometimes the upper room did not remain open, but a curtain was drawn,\r\naccording to the necessity of the action. The heroes of the play moved\r\nabout the place, and went from one scaffold to another; dialogue then\r\ntook place between players on the ground and players on the boards:\r\n\"Here thei take Jhesu and lede hym in gret hast to Herowde; and the\r\nHerowdys scaffald xal unclose, shewyng Herowdes in astat, alle the Jewys\r\nknelyng except Annas and Cayaphas.\"[792] Chaucer speaks of the \"scaffold\r\nhye\" on which jolif Absolon played Herod; king Herod in fact was always\r\nenthroned high above the common rabble.\r\n\r\nThe arrangements adopted in England differed little, as we see, from the\r\nFrench ones; and it could scarcely be otherwise, as the taste for these\r\ndramas had been imported by the Normans and Angevins. Neither in\r\nEngland nor in France were there ever any of those six-storied theatres\r\ndescribed by the brothers Parfait, each story being supposed to\r\nrepresent a different place or country. To keep to truth, we should, on\r\nthe contrary, picture to ourselves those famous buildings stretched all\r\nalong on the ground, with their different compartments scattered round\r\nthe public square.\r\n\r\nBut we have better than words and descriptions to give us an idea of the\r\nsight; we have actual pictures, offering to view all the details of the\r\nperformances. An exquisite miniature of Jean Fouquet, preserved at\r\nChantilly, which has never been studied as it ought to be with reference\r\nto this question, has for its subject the life of St. Apollinia. Instead\r\nof painting a fancy picture, Fouquet has chosen to represent the\r\nmartyrdom of the saint as it was acted in a miracle play.[793] The main\r\naction takes place on the ground; Apollinia is there, in the middle of\r\nthe executioners. Round the place are scaffolds with a lower room and\r\nan upper room, as at Chester, and there are curtains to close them. One\r\nof those boxes represents Paradise; angels with folded arms, quietly\r\nseated on the wooden steps of their stairs, await the moment when they\r\nmust speak; another is filled with musicians playing the organ and other\r\ninstruments; a third contains the throne of the king. The throne is\r\nempty; for the king, Julian the apostate, his sceptre, adorned with\r\n_fleurs-de-lys_, in his hand, has come down his ladder to take part in\r\nthe main action. Hell has its usual shape of a monstrous head, with\r\nopening and closing jaws; it stands on the ground, for the better\r\naccommodation of devils, who had constantly to interfere in the drama,\r\nand to keep the interest of the crowd alive, by running suddenly through\r\nit, with their feathers and animals' skins, howling and grinning; \"to\r\nthe great terror of little children,\" says Rabelais, who, like Chaucer,\r\nhad often been present at such dramas. Several devils are to be seen in\r\nthe miniature; they have cloven feet, and stand outside the hell-mouth;\r\na buffoon also is to be seen, who raises a laugh among the audience and\r\nshows his scorn for the martyr by the means described three centuries\r\nearlier in John of Salisbury's book, exhibiting his person in a way\r\n\"quam erubescat videre vel cynicus.\"\r\n\r\nBesides the scaffolds, boxes or \"estableis\" meant for actors, others are\r\nreserved for spectators of importance, or those who paid best. This\r\ncommingling of actors and spectators would seem to us somewhat\r\nconfusing; but people were not then very exacting; with them illusion\r\nwas easily caused, and never broken. This magnificent part of the\r\naudience, besides, with its rich garments, was itself a sight; and so\r\nlittle objection was made to the presence of beholders of that sort that\r\nwe shall find them seated on the Shakesperean stage as well as on the\r\nstage of Corneille and of Moliere. \"I was on the stage, meaning to\r\nlisten to the play ...\" says the Eraste of \"Les Facheux.\" In the time\r\nof Shakespeare the custom followed was even more against theatrical\r\nillusion, as there were gentlemen not only on the sides of the scene,\r\nbut also behind the actors; they filled a vast box fronting the pit.\r\n\r\nThe dresses were rich: this is the best that can be said of them. Saints\r\nenwreathed their chins with curling beards of gold; God the Father was\r\ndressed as a pope or a bishop. For good reasons the audience did not ask\r\nmuch in the way of historical accuracy; all it wanted was _signs_. Copes\r\nand tiaras were in its eyes religious signs by excellence, and in the\r\nwearer of such they recognised God without hesitation. The turban of the\r\nSaracens, Mahomet the prophet of the infidels, were known to the mob,\r\nwhich saw in them the signs and symbols of irreligiousness and impiety.\r\nHerod, for this cause, wore a turban, and swore premature oaths by\r\n\"Mahound.\" People were familiar with symbols, and the use of them was\r\ncontinued; the painters at the Renaissance represented St. Stephen with\r\na stone in his hand and St. Paul with a sword, which stone and sword\r\nstood for symbols, and the sight of them evoked all the doleful tale of\r\ntheir sufferings and death.\r\n\r\nThe authors of Mysteries did not pay, as we may well believe, great\r\nattention to the rule of the three Unities. The events included in the\r\nFrench Mystery of the \"Vieil Testament\" did not take place in one day,\r\nbut in four thousand years. The most distant localities were represented\r\nnext to each other: Rome, Jerusalem, Marseilles. The scaffolds huddled\r\nclose together scarcely gave an idea of geographical realities; the\r\nimagination of the beholders was expected to supply what was wanting:\r\nand so it did. A few square yards of ground (sometimes, it must be\r\nacknowledged, of water) were supposed to be the Mediterranean;\r\nMarseilles was at one end, and Jaffa at the other. A few minutes did\r\nduty for months, years, or centuries. Herod sends a messenger to\r\nTiberius; the tetrarch has scarcely finished his speech when his man is\r\nalready at Rome, and delivers his message to the emperor. Noah gets into\r\nhis ark and shuts his window; here a silence lasting a minute or so; the\r\nwindow opens, and Noah declares that the forty days are past (\"Chester\r\nPlays\").\r\n\r\nTo render, however, his task easier to the public, some precautions were\r\ntaken to let them perceive where they were. Sometimes the name of the\r\nplace was written on a piece of wood or canvas, a clear and honest\r\nmeans.[794] It worked so successfully that it was still resorted to in\r\nElizabethan times; we see \"Thebes written in great letters upon an olde\r\ndoore,\" says Sir Philip Sidney, and without asking for more we are bound\r\n\"to beleeve that it is Thebes.\" In other cases the actor followed the\r\nsneering advice Boileau was to express later, and in very simple fashion\r\ndeclared who he was: I am Herod! I am Tiberius! Or again, when they\r\nmoved from one place to another, they named both: now we are arrived, I\r\nrecognise Marseilles; \"her is the lond of Mercylle.\"[795] Most of those\r\ninventions were long found to answer, and very often Shakespeare had no\r\nbetter ones to use. The same necessities caused him to make up for the\r\ndeficiency of the scenery by his wonderful descriptions of landscapes,\r\ncastles, and wild moors. All that poetry would have been lost had he had\r\npainted scenery at his disposal.\r\n\r\nSome attempts at painted scenery were made, it is true, but so plain and\r\nprimitive that the thing again acted as a symbol rather than as the\r\nrepresentation of a place. A throne meant the palace of the king. God\r\ndivides light from darkness: \"Now must be exhibited a sheet painted,\r\nknow you, one half all white and the other half all black.\" The creation\r\nof animals comes nearer the real truth: \"Now must be let loose little\r\nbirds that will fly in the air, and must be placed on the ground, ducks,\r\nswans, geese ... with as many strange beasts as it will have been\r\npossible to secure.\" But truth absolute was observed when the state of\r\ninnocence had to be represented: \"Now must Adam rise all naked and look\r\nround with an air of admiration and wonder.\"[796] Beholders doubtless\r\nreturned his wonder and admiration. In the Chester Mysteries a practical\r\nrecommendation is made to the actors who personate the first couple:\r\n\"Adam and Eve shall stande nakede, and shall not be ashamed.\"[797] The\r\nproper time to be ashamed will come a little later. The serpent steals\r\n\"out of a hole\"; man falls: \"Now must Adam cover himself and feign to be\r\nashamed. The woman must also be seized with shame, and cover herself\r\nwith her hands.\"[798]\r\n\r\nIf painted scenery was greatly neglected, machinery received more\r\nattention. That characteristic of modern times, yeast through which the\r\nold world has been transformed, the hankering after the unattainable,\r\nwhich caused so many great deeds, had also smaller results; it affected\r\nthese humble details. Painted canvas was neglected, but people laboured\r\nat the inventing of machinery. While a sheet half white and half black\r\nwas hung to represent light and chaos, in the drama of \"Adam,\" so early\r\nas the twelfth century, a self-moving serpent, \"serpens artificiose\r\ncompositus,\" tempted the woman in Paradise. Wondering Eve offered but\r\nsmall resistance. Elsewhere an angel carried Enoch \"by a subtile engine\"\r\ninto Paradise. In the Doomesday play of the Chester Mysteries, \"Jesus\r\nwas to come down as on a cloud, if that could be managed.\" But sometimes\r\nit could not; in Fouquet's miniature the angels have no other machinery\r\nbut a ladder to allow them to descend from heaven to earth. In the \"Mary\r\nMagdalene\" of the Digby Mysteries a boat appeared with mast and sail,\r\nand carried to Palestine the King of Marseilles.\r\n\r\nHell was in all times most carefully arranged, and it had the best\r\nmachinery. The mouth opened and closed, threw flames from its nostrils,\r\nand let loose upon the crowd devils armed with hooks and emitting awful\r\nyells. From the back of the mouth appalling noises were heard, being\r\nmeant for the moans of the damned. These moans were produced by a simple\r\nprocess: pots and frying-pans were knocked against each other. In\r\n\"Adam,\" the heroes of the play are taken to hell, there to await the\r\ncoming of Christ; and the scene, according to the stage direction in the\r\nmanuscript, was to be represented thus: \"Then the Devil will come and\r\nthree or four devils with him with chains in their hands and iron rings\r\nwhich they will put round the neck of Adam and Eve. Some push them and\r\nothers draw them toward hell. Other devils awaiting them by the entrance\r\njump and tumble as a sign of their joy for the event.\" After Adam has\r\nbeen received within the precincts of hell, \"the devils will cause a\r\ngreat smoke to rise; they will emit merry vociferations, and knock\r\ntogether their pans and caldrons so as to be heard from the outside.\r\nAfter a while, some devils will come out and run about the place.\" Pans\r\nwere of frequent use; Abel had one under his tunic, and Cain, knocking\r\non it, drew forth lugubrious sounds, which went to the heart of the\r\naudience.\r\n\r\nThe machinery became more and more complicated toward the time of the\r\nRenaissance; but much money was needed, and for long the Court or the\r\nmunicipalities could alone use them. In England fixed or movable scenery\r\nreaches great perfection at Court: Inigo Jones shows a genius in\r\narranging elegant decorations; some of his sketches have been\r\npreserved.[799] But such splendid inventions were too costly to be\r\ntransferred to the stages for which Shakespeare wrote; and he never used\r\nany other magic but that of his poetry. Inigo Jones had fine\r\nscene-shiftings with the help of his machinists, and Shakespeare with\r\nthe help of his verses; these last have this advantage, that they have\r\nnot faded, and can still be seen.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be thought of so much simplicity, childishness, or\r\nbarbarity of those ivy-clad ruins, the forms of which can scarcely be\r\ndiscerned, they must be subjected to a closer inspection; and if there\r\nwere no other, this one consideration would be enough to incline us to\r\nit: while in the theatre of Bacchus the tragedies of Sophocles were\r\nplayed once and no more, the Christian drama, remodelled from century to\r\ncentury, was represented for four hundred years before immense\r\nmultitudes; and this is a unique phenomenon in the history of\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nThe fact may be ascribed to several causes, some of which have already\r\nbeen pointed out. The desire to see was extremely keen, and there was\r\nseen all that could be wished: the unattainable, the unperceivable,\r\nmiracles, the king's Court, earthly paradise, all that had been heard of\r\nor dreamt about. Means of realisation were rude, but the public held\r\nthem satisfactory.\r\n\r\nWhat feasts were in the year, sacraments were in the existence of men;\r\nthey marked the great memorable stages of life. A complete net of\r\nobservances and religious obligations surrounded the months and seasons;\r\nbells never remained long silent; they rang less discreetly than now,\r\nand were not afraid to disturb conversations by their noise. At each\r\nperiod of the day they recalled that there were prayers to say, and to\r\nthose even who did not pray they recalled the importance of religion.\r\nExistences were thus impregnated with religion; and religion was in its\r\nentirety explained, made accessible and visible, in the Mysteries.\r\n\r\nThe verses spoken by the actors did not much resemble those in\r\nShakespeare; they were, in most cases, mere tattle, scarcely verses;\r\nrhyme and alliteration were sometimes used both together, and both\r\nanyhow. And yet the emotion was deep; in the state of mind with which\r\nthe spectators came, nothing would have prevented their being touched by\r\nthe affecting scenes, neither the lame verse nor the clumsy machinery;\r\nthe cause of the emotion was the subject, and not the manner in which\r\nthe subject was represented. All the past of humanity and its eternal\r\nfuture were at stake; players, therefore, were sometimes interrupted by\r\nthe passionate exclamations of the crowd. At a drama lately represented\r\non the stage of the Comedie Francaise, one of the audience astonished\r\nhis neighbours by crying: \"Mais signe donc! Est-elle bete!...\" In the\r\nopen air of the public place, at a time when manners were less polished,\r\nmany such interjections interrupted the performance; many insulting\r\napostrophes were addressed to Eve when she listened to the serpent; and\r\nthe serpent spoke (in the Norman drama of \"Adam\") a language easy to\r\nunderstand, the language of everyday life:\r\n\r\n\"_Diabolus._--I saw Adam; he is an ass.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Eva._--He is a little hard.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Diabolus._--We shall melt him; but at present he is harder than iron.\"\r\n\r\nBut thou, Eve, thou art a superior being, a delicate one, a delight for\r\nthe eyes. \"Thou art a little tender thing, fresher than the rose, whiter\r\nthan crystal, or snow falling on the ice in a dale. The Creator has\r\nbadly matched the couple; thou art too sweet; man is too hard.... For\r\nwhich it is very pleasant to draw close to thee. Let me have a talk with\r\nthee.\"[800]\r\n\r\nAnd for such cajolery, for such folly, thought the crowd, for this sin\r\nof our common mother, we sweat and we suffer, we observe Lent, we\r\nexperience temptations, and under our feet this awful hell-mouth opens,\r\nin which, maybe, we shall some day fall. Eve, turn away from the\r\nserpent!\r\n\r\nGreater even was the emotion caused by the drama of the Passion, the\r\nsufferings of the Redeemer, all the details of which were familiar to\r\neverybody. The indignation was so keen that the executioners had\r\ndifficulty sometimes in escaping the fury of the multitude.\r\n\r\nThe Middle Ages were the age of contrasts; what measure meant was then\r\nunknown. This has already been noticed _a propos_ of Chaucer; the\r\ncleverest _compensated_, as Chaucer did, their Miller's tales with\r\nstories of Griselda. When they intend to be tender the authors of\r\nMysteries fall in most cases into that mawkish sentimentality by which\r\nthe man of the people or the barbarian is often detected. A feeling for\r\nmeasure is a produce of civilisation, and men of the people ignore it.\r\nThose street daubers who draw on the flags of the London foot-paths\r\nalways represent heartrending scenes, or scenes of a sweetness\r\nunspeakable: here are fires, storms, and disasters; now a soldier, in\r\nthe middle of a battle, forgets his own danger, and washes the wound of\r\nhis horse; then cascades under an azure sky, amidst a spring landscape,\r\nwith a blue bird flying about. Many such drawings might be detected in\r\nDickens, many also in the Mysteries. After a truly touching scene\r\nbetween Abraham and his son, the pretty things Isaac does and says, his\r\nprayer not to see the sword so keen, cease to touch, and come very near\r\nmaking us laugh. The contrast between the fury of Herod and the\r\nsweetness of Joseph and Mary is similarly carried to an extreme. This\r\nsame Joseph who a minute ago insulted his wife in words impossible to\r\nquote, has now become such a sweet and gentle saint that one can\r\nscarcely believe the same man addresses us. He is packing before his\r\njourney to Egypt; he will take his tools with him, his \"_smale_\r\ninstrumentes.\"[801] Is there anything more touching? Nothing, except\r\nperhaps the appeal of the street painter, calling our attention to the\r\nfact that he draws \"on the _rude_ stone.\" How could the passer-by not be\r\ntouched by the idea that the stone is so hard? In the Middle Ages people\r\nmelted at this, they were moved, they wept; and all at once they were in\r\na mood to enjoy the most enormous buffooneries. These fill a large place\r\nin the Mysteries, and beside them shine scenes of real comedy, evincing\r\ngreat accuracy of observation.\r\n\r\nThe personages worst treated in Mysteries are always kings; they are\r\nmostly represented as being grotesque and mischievous. The playwrights\r\nmight have given as their excuse that their kings are miscreants, and\r\nthat black is not dark enough to paint such faces. But to this\r\ncommendable motive was added a sly pleasure felt in caricaturing those\r\ngreat men, not only because they were heathens, but also because they\r\nwere kings; for when Christian princes and lords appear on the stage,\r\nthe satire is often continued. Thus Lancelot of the Lake appears\r\nunexpectedly at the Court of king Herod, and after much rant the lover\r\nof queen Guinevere draws his invincible sword and massacres the\r\nInnocents (\"Chester Plays\").\r\n\r\nHerod, Augustus, Tiberius, Pilate, Pharaoh, the King of Marseilles,\r\nalways open the scenes where they figure with a speech, in which they\r\nsound their own praise. It was an established tradition; in the same way\r\nas God the Father delivered a sermon, these personages made what the\r\nmanuscripts technically call \"their boast.\" They are the masters of the\r\nuniverse; they wield the thunder; everybody obeys them; they swear and\r\ncurse unblushingly (by Mahomet); they are very noisy. They strut about,\r\nproud of their fine dresses and fine phrases, and of their French,\r\nFrench being there again a token of power and authority. The English\r\nHerod could not claim kinship with the Norman Dukes, but the subjects of\r\nAngevin monarchs would have shrugged their shoulders at the\r\nrepresentation of a prince who did not speak French. It was for them the\r\nsign of princeship, as a tiara was the sign of godhead. Herod therefore\r\nspoke French, a very mean sort of French, it is true, and the Parliament\r\nof Paris which was to express later its indignation at the faulty\r\ngrammar of the \"Confreres de la Passion\" would have suffered much if it\r\nhad seen what became of the noble language of France on the scaffolds at\r\nChester. But it did not matter; any words were enough, in the same way\r\nas any sword would do as an emblem for St. Paul.\r\n\r\nOne of the duties of these strutting heroes was to maintain silence. It\r\nseemed as if they had a privilege for noise making, and they repressed\r\nencroachments; their task was not an easy one. Be still, \"beshers,\"\r\ncries Augustus; \"beshers\" means \"beaux sires\" in the kingly French of\r\nthe Mysteries:\r\n\r\n    Be stylle, beshers, I commawnd you,\r\n    That no man speke a word here now\r\n            Bot I my self alon.\r\n    And if ye do, I make a vow,\r\n    Thys brand abowte youre nekys shalle bow,\r\n            For-thy by stylle as ston.[802]\r\n\r\nSilence! cries Tiberius. Silence! cries Herod:\r\n\r\n    Styr not bot ye have lefe,\r\n    For if ye do I clefe\r\n            You smalle as flesh to pott.[803]\r\n\r\nTiberius knows Latin, and does not conceal it from the audience:\r\n\r\n    Stynt, I say, gyf men place, quia sum dominus dominorum,\r\n    He that agans me says rapietur lux oculorum.[804]\r\n\r\nAnd each of them hereupon moves about his scaffold, and gives the best\r\nidea he can of the magnitude of his power:\r\n\r\n    Above all kynges under the cloudys crystall,\r\n    Royally I reigne in welthe without woo ...\r\n    I am Kyng Herowdes.[805]\r\n\r\nBe it known, says another:\r\n\r\n    That of heven and hell chyff rewlar am I,\r\n    To wos magnyfycens non stondyt egall,\r\n    For I am soveren of al soverens.[806]\r\n\r\nMake room, says a third:\r\n\r\n    A-wantt, a-want the, on-worthy wrecchesse!\r\n    Why lowtt ye nat low to my lawdabyll presens?...\r\n    I am a sofereyn semely, that ye se butt seyld;\r\n    Non swyche onder sonne, the sothe for to say ...\r\n    I am kyng of Marcylle![807]\r\n\r\nSuch princes fear nothing, and are never abashed; they are on familiar\r\nterms with the audience, and interpellate the bystanders, which was a\r\nsure cause of merriment, but not of good order. Octavian, being well\r\npleased with the services of one of his men, tells him:\r\n\r\n    Boye, their be ladyes many a one,\r\n    Amonge them all chouse thee one,\r\n    Take the faierest, or elles non,\r\n    And freely I geve her thee.[808]\r\n\r\nEvery lord bows to my law, observes Tiberius:\r\n\r\n    Is it nat so? Sey yow all with on showte.\r\n\r\nand a note in the manuscript has: \"Here answerryt all the pepul at\r\nons,'Ya, my lord, ya.'\"[809] All this was performed with appropriate\r\ngesture, that is, as wild as the words they went with, a tradition that\r\nlong survived. Shakespeare complained, as we know, of the delivery of\r\nthose actors who \"out-heroded Herod.\"\r\n\r\nThe authors of English Mysteries had no great experience of Courts; they\r\ndrew their caricatures somewhat haphazard. They were neither very\r\nlearned nor very careful; anachronisms and mistakes swarm under their\r\npen. While Herod sacrifices to Mahomet, Noah invokes the Blessed Virgin,\r\nand the Christmas shepherds swear by \"the death of Christ,\" whose birth\r\nis announced to them at the end of the play.\r\n\r\nThe psychology of these dramas is not very deep, especially when the\r\nquestion is of personages of rank, and of feelings of a refined sort.\r\nThe authors of Mysteries speak then at random and describe by hearsay;\r\nthey have seen their models only from afar, and are not familiar with\r\nthem. When they have to show how it is that young Mary Magdalen, as\r\nvirtuous as she was beautiful, consents to sin for the first time, they\r\ndo it in the plainest fashion. A \"galaunt\" meets her and tells her that\r\nhe finds her very pretty, and loves her. \"Why, sir,\" the young lady\r\nreplies, \"wene you that I were a kelle (prostitute)?\" Not at all, says\r\nthe other, but you are so pretty! Shall we not dance together? Shall we\r\ndrink something?\r\n\r\n    Soppes in wyne, how love ye?\r\n\r\nMary does not resist those proofs of true love, and answers:\r\n\r\n    As ye dou, so doth me;\r\n    I am ryth glad that met be we;\r\n    My love in yow gynnyt to close.\r\n\r\nThen, \"derlyng dere,\" let us go, says the \"galaunt.\"\r\n\r\n    _Mary._   Ewyn at your wyl, my dere derlyng!\r\n              Thow ye wyl go to the woldes eynd,\r\n              I wol never from yow wynd (turn).[810]\r\n\r\nClarissa Harlowe will require more forms and more time; here twenty-five\r\nverses have been enough. A century and a half divides \"Mary Magdalene\"\r\nfrom the dramatised story of the \"Weeping Bitch\"; the interpretation of\r\nthe movements of the feminine heart has not greatly improved, and we are\r\nvery far as yet from Richardson and Shakespeare.\r\n\r\nBut truth was more closely observed when the authors spoke of what they\r\nknew by personal experience, and described men of the poorer sort with\r\nwhom they were familiar. In this lies the main literary merit of the\r\nMysteries; there may be found the earliest scenes of real comedy in the\r\nhistory of the English stage.\r\n\r\nThis comedy of course is very near farce: in everything people then went\r\nto extremes. Certain merry scenes were as famous as the rant of Herod,\r\nand they have for centuries amused the England of former days. The\r\nstrife between husband and wife, Noah and his wife, Pilate and his wife,\r\nJoseph and Mary, this last a very shocking one, were among the most\r\npopular.\r\n\r\nIn all the collections of English Mysteries Noah's wife is an untamed\r\nshrew, who refuses to enter the ark. In the York collection, Noah being\r\nordered by \"Deus\" to build his boat, wonders somewhat at first:\r\n\r\n    A! worthy lorde, wolde thou take heede,\r\n    I am full olde and oute of qwarte.\r\n\r\nHe sets to work, however; rain begins; the time for sailing has arrived:\r\nNoah calls his wife; she does not come. Get into the ark and \"leve the\r\nharde lande?\" This she will not do. She meant to go this very day to\r\ntown, and she will:\r\n\r\n    Doo barnes, goo we and trusse to towne.\r\n\r\nShe does not fear the flood; Noah remarks that the rain has been\r\nterrific of late, and has lasted many days, and that her idea of going\r\njust then to town is not very wise. The lady is not a whit pacified; why\r\nhave made a secret of all this to her? Why had he not consulted her? It\r\nturns out that her husband had been working at the ark for a hundred\r\nyears, and she did not know of it! Life in a boat is not at all\r\npleasant; anyhow she will want time to pack; also she must take her\r\ngossips with her, to have some one to talk to during the voyage. Noah,\r\nwho in building his boat has given some proof of his patience, does not\r\nlose courage; he receives a box on the ear; he is content with saying:\r\n\r\n    I pray the, dame, be stille.\r\n\r\nThe wife at length gets in, and, as we may believe, stormy days in more\r\nsenses than one are in store for the patriarch.[811]\r\n\r\nSt. Joseph is a poor craftsman, described from nature, using the\r\nlanguage of craftsmen, having their manners, their ignorances, their\r\naspirations. Few works in the whole range of mediaeval literature\r\ncontain better descriptions of the workman of that time than the\r\nMysteries in which St. Joseph figures; some of his speeches ought to\r\nhave a place in the collections of Political Songs. The Emperor Augustus\r\nhas availed himself of the occasion afforded by the census to establish\r\na new tax: \"A! lorde,\" says the poor Joseph,\r\n\r\n            what doth this man nowe heare!\r\n    Poore mens weale is ever in were (doubt),\r\n    I wotte by this bolsters beare\r\n    That tribute I muste paye;\r\n    And for greate age and no power\r\n    I wan no good this seven yeaire;\r\n    Nowe comes the kinges messingere,\r\n    To gette all that he maye.\r\n    With this axe that I beare,\r\n    This perscer and this nagere,\r\n    A hamer all in feare,\r\n    I have wonnen my meate.\r\n    Castill, tower ne manere\r\n    Had I never in my power;\r\n    But as a simple carpentere\r\n    With these what I mighte gette.\r\n    Yf I have store nowe anye thing,\r\n    That I must paye unto the kinge.[812]\r\n\r\nOnly an ox is left him; he will go and sell it. It is easy to fancy\r\nthat, in the century which saw the Statutes of Labourers and the rising\r\nof the peasants, such words found a ready echo in the audience.\r\n\r\nAs soon as men of the people appear on the scene, nearly always the\r\ndialogue becomes lively; real men and women stand and talk before us.\r\nBeside the workmen represented by St. Joseph, peasants appear,\r\nrepresented by the shepherds of Christmas night. They are true English\r\nshepherds; if they swear, somewhat before due time, by Christ, all\r\nsurprise disappears when we hear them name the places where they live:\r\nLancashire, the Clyde valley, Boughton near Chester, Norbury near\r\nWakefield. Of all possible ales, Ely's is the one they prefer. They talk\r\ntogether of the weather, the time of the day, the mean salaries they\r\nget, the stray sheep they have been seeking; they eat their meals under\r\nthe hedge, sing merry songs, exchange a few blows, in fact behave as\r\ntrue shepherds of real life. Quite at the end only, when the \"Gloria\" is\r\nheard, they will assume the sober attitude befitting Christmas Day.\r\n\r\nIn the Mysteries performed at Woodkirk, the visit to the new-born Child\r\nwas preceded by a comedy worthy to be compared with the famous farce of\r\n\"Pathelin,\" and which has nothing to do with Christmas.[813] It is\r\nnight; the shepherds talk; the time for sleeping comes. One among them,\r\nMak, has a bad repute, and is suspected of being a thief; they ask him\r\nto sleep in the midst of the others: \"Com heder, betwene shalle thou lyg\r\ndowne.\" But Mak rises during the night without being observed. How hard\r\nthey sleep! he says, and he carries away a \"fatt shepe,\" and takes it to\r\nhis wife.\r\n\r\n    _Wife._ It were a fowlle blotte to be hanged for the case.\r\n\r\n    _Mak._  I have skapyd, Gelott, oft as hard as glase.\r\n\r\n    _Wife._ Bot so long goys the pott to the water, men says,\r\n                                 At last\r\n                        Comys it home broken.\r\n\r\nI remember it well, says Mak, but it is not a time for proverbs and\r\ntalk; let us do for the best. The shepherds know Mak too well not to\r\ncome straight to his house; and so they do. Moans are heard; the cause\r\nbeing, they learn, that Mak's wife has just given birth to a child. As\r\nthe shepherds walk in, Mak meets them with a cheerful countenance, and\r\nwelcomes them heartily:\r\n\r\n    Bot ar ye in this towne to-day?\r\n        Now how fare ye?\r\n    Ye have ryn in the myre, and ar weytt yit;\r\n    I shalle make you a fyre, if ye wille syt.\r\n\r\nHis offers are coldly received, and the visitors explain what has\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\n    Nowe if you have suspowse, to Gille or to me,\r\n    Com and rype oure howse!\r\n\r\nThe woman moans more pitifully than ever:\r\n\r\n    _Wife._  Outt, thefys, fro my barne! negh hym not thore.\r\n\r\n    _Mak._   Wyst ye how she had farne, youre hartys wold be sore.\r\n             Ye do wrang, I you warne, that thus commys before\r\n             To a woman that has farne, bot I say no more.\r\n\r\n    _Wife._  A my medylle!\r\n             I pray God so mylde,\r\n             If ever I you begyld,\r\n             That I ete this chylde\r\n             That lyges in this credylle.\r\n\r\nThe shepherds, deafened by the noise, look none the less about the\r\nhouse, but find nothing. Their host is not yet, however, at the end of\r\nhis trouble.\r\n\r\n    _Tertius Pastor._ Mak, with youre lefe, let me gyf youre barne\r\n                                Bot six pence.\r\n\r\n    _Mak._            Nay, do way, he slepys.\r\n\r\n    _Pastor._         Me thynk he pepys.\r\n\r\n    _Mak._            When he wakyns he wepys;\r\n                           I pray you go hence.\r\n\r\n    _Pastor._         Gyf me lefe hym to kys, and lyft up the clowth.\r\n                      What the deville is this? he has a long snowte!\r\n\r\nAnd the fraud is discovered; it was the sheep. From oaths they were\r\ncoming to blows, when on a sudden, amid the stars, angels are seen, and\r\ntheir song is heard in the night: Glory to God, peace to earth! the\r\nworld is rejuvenated.... Anger disappears, hatreds are effaced, and the\r\nrough shepherds of England take, with penitent heart, the road to\r\nBethlehem.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nThe fourteenth century saw the religious drama at its height in England;\r\nthe fifteenth saw its decay; the sixteenth its death. The form under\r\nwhich it was best liked was the form of Mysteries, based upon the Bible.\r\nThe dramatising of the lives of saints and miracles of the Virgin was\r\nmuch less popular in England than in France. In the latter country\r\nenormous collections of such plays have been preserved[814]; in the\r\nother the examples of this kind are very few; the Bible was the main\r\nsource from which the English dramatists drew their inspiration. As we\r\nhave seen, however, they did not forbear from adding scenes and\r\ncharacters with nothing evangelical in them; these scenes contributed,\r\nwith the interludes and the facetious dialogues of the jongleurs, to the\r\nformation of comedy. Little by little, comedy took shape, and it will be\r\nfound existing as a separate branch of dramatic art at the time of the\r\nRenaissance.\r\n\r\nIn the same period another sort of drama was to flourish, the origin of\r\nwhich was as old as the fourteenth century, namely, _Moralities_. These\r\nplays consisted in pious treatises and ethical books turned into dramas,\r\nas Mysteries offered a dramatisation of Scriptures. Psychology was there\r\ncarried to the extreme, a peculiar sort of psychology, elementary and\r\nexcessive at the same time, and very different from the delicate art in\r\nfavour to-day. Individuals disappeared; they were replaced by\r\nabstractions, and these abstractions represented only a single quality\r\nor defect. Sins and virtues fought together and tried to draw mankind to\r\nthem, which stood doubtful, as Hercules \"at the starting point of a\r\ndouble road;\" in this way, again, was manifested the fondness felt in\r\nthe Middle Ages for allegories and symbols. The \"Roman de la Rose\" in\r\nFrance, \"Piers Plowman\" in England, the immense popularity in all Europe\r\nof the Consolation of Boethius, had already been manifestations of those\r\nsame tendencies. In these works, already, dialogue was abundant, in the\r\n\"Roman de la Rose\" especially, where an immense space is occupied by\r\nconversations between the Lover and Fals-Semblant.[815] The names of the\r\nspeakers are inscribed in the margin, as if it were a real play. When he\r\nadmitted into his collection of tales the dialogued story of Melibeus\r\nand Prudence, Chaucer came very near to Moralities, for the work he\r\nproduced was neither a treatise nor a tale, nor a drama, but had\r\nsomething of the three; a few changes would have been enough to make of\r\nit a Morality, which might have been called the Debate of Wisdom and\r\nMankind.\r\n\r\nAbstractions had been allowed a place in the Mysteries so far back as\r\nthe fourteenth century; death figures in the Woodkirk collection; in\r\n\"Mary Magdalene\" (fifteenth century) many abstract personages are mixed\r\nwith the others: the Seven Deadly Sins, Mundus, the King of the Flesh,\r\nSensuality, &c.; the same thing happens in the so-called Coventry\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\nThis sort of drama, for us unendurable, gradually separated from\r\nMysteries; it reached its greatest development under the early Tudors.\r\nThe authors of Moralities strove to write plays not merely amusing, as\r\nfarces, then also in great favour, but plays with a useful and practical\r\naim. By means of now unreadable dramas, virtues, religion, morals,\r\nsciences were taught: the Catholic faith was derided by Protestants,\r\nand the Reformation by Catholics.[816] The discovery, then quite new, of\r\nAmerica was discoursed about, and great regret was expressed at its\r\nbeing not due to an Englishman:\r\n\r\n    O what a thynge had be than,\r\n    If they that be Englyshemen\r\n    Myght have ben furst of all\r\n    That there shuld have take possessyon![817]\r\n\r\nDeath, as might be expected, is placed upon the stage with a particular\r\nzeal and care, and meditations are dedicated to the dark future of man,\r\nand to the gnawing worm of the charnel house.[818]\r\n\r\nFearing the audience might go to sleep, or perhaps go away, the science\r\nand the austere philosophy taught in these plays were enlivened by\r\ntavern scenes, and by the gambols of a clown, fool, or buffoon, called\r\nVice, armed, as Harlequin, with a wooden dagger. And often, such is\r\nhuman frailty, the beholders went, remembering nothing but the mad\r\npranks of Vice. It was in their eyes the most important character in the\r\nplay, and the part was accordingly entrusted to the best actor.\r\nShakespeare had seen Vice still alive, and he commemorated his deeds in\r\na song:\r\n\r\n        I am gone, sir,\r\n        And anon, sir,\r\n    I'll be with you again,\r\n        In a trice,\r\n        Like to the old Vice,\r\n    Your need to sustain,\r\n    Who, with dagger of lath,\r\n    In his rage and his wrath,\r\n        Cries, ah ha! to the devil.[819]\r\n\r\nThis character also found place on the French stage, where it was called\r\nthe \"Badin.\" Rabelais had the \"Badin\" in great esteem: \"In this manner\r\nwe see, among the jongleurs, when they arrange between them the cast of\r\na play, the part of the Sot, or Badin, to be attributed to the cleverest\r\nand most experienced in their company.\"[820]\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, common ancestors of the various dramatic tribes,\r\nsource and origin of many sorts of plays, the Mysteries, which had\r\ncontributed to the formation of the tragical, romantic, allegorical,\r\npastoral, and comic drama, were still in existence. Reformation had\r\ncome, the people had adopted the new belief, but they could not give up\r\nthe Mysteries. They continued to like Herod, Noah and his wife, and the\r\ntumultuous troup of devils, great and small, inhabiting hell-mouth.\r\nPrologues had been written in which excuses were offered on account of\r\nthe traces of superstition to be detected in the plays, but conscience\r\nbeing thus set at rest, the plays were performed as before. The\r\nProtestant bishop of Chester prohibited the representation in 1572, but\r\nit took place all the same. The archbishop of York renewed the\r\nprohibition in 1575, but the Mysteries were performed again for four\r\ndays; and some representations of them took place even later.[821] At\r\nYork the inhabitants had no less reluctance about giving up their old\r\ndrama; they were sorry to think that religious differences now existed\r\nbetween the town and its beloved tragedies. Converted to the new faith,\r\nthe citizens would have liked to convert the plays too, and the margins\r\nof the manuscript bear witness to their efforts. But the task was a\r\ndifficult one; they were at their wits' end, and appealed to men more\r\nlearned than they. They decided that \"the booke shalbe carried to my\r\nLord Archebisshop and Mr. Deane to correcte, if that my Lord\r\nArchebisshop do well like theron,\" 1579.[822] My Lord Archbishop, wise\r\nand prudent, settled the question according to administrative precedent;\r\nhe stored the book away somewhere, and the inhabitants were simply\r\ninformed that the prohibition was maintained. The York plays thus died.\r\n\r\nIn France the Mysteries survived quite as late; but, on account of the\r\nradical effects of the Renaissance there, they had not the same\r\ninfluence on the future development of the drama. They continued to be\r\nrepresented in the sixteenth century, and the Parliament of Paris\r\ncomplained in 1542 of their too great popularity: parish priests, and\r\neven the chanters of the Holy Chapel, sang vespers at noon, a most\r\nunbecoming hour, and sang them \"post haste,\" to see the sight. Six years\r\nlater the performance of Mysteries was forbidden at Paris; but the cross\r\nand ladder, emblems of the \"Confreres de la Passion,\" continued to be\r\nseen above the gates of the \"Hotel de Bourgogne,\" and the privilege of\r\nthe Confreres, which dated three centuries back, was definitely\r\nabolished in the reign of Louis XIV., in December, 1676.[823] Moliere\r\nhad then been dead for three years.\r\n\r\nIn England, at the date when my Lord Archbishop stopped the\r\nrepresentation at York,[824] the old religious dramas had produced all\r\ntheir fruit: they had kept alive the taste for stage plays, they left\r\nbehind them authors, a public, and companies of players. Then was\r\ngrowing in years, in a little town by the side of the river Avon, the\r\nchild who was to reach the highest summits of art. He followed on\r\nweek-days the teaching of the grammar school; he saw on Sundays, painted\r\non the wall of the Holy Cross Chapel, a paradise and hell similar to\r\nthose in the Mysteries, angels of gold and black devils, and that\r\nimmense mouth where the damned are parboiled, \"ou damnes sont boulus,\"\r\nas the poor old mother of Villon says in a ballad of her son's.[825]\r\n\r\nAt the date of the York prohibition, William Shakespeare was fifteen.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[742] \"Nostra aetas prolapsa ad fabulas et quaevis inania, non modo sures\r\net cor prostituit vanitati, sed oculorum et aurium voluptate suam mulcet\r\ndesidiam....

It is an apocryphal life of Apollinia, in\r\nwhich is explained how she is the saint to be applied to when suffering\r\ntoothache. This episode is the one Fouquet has represented. Asked to\r\nrenounce Christ, she answers: \"'Quamdiu vivero in hac fragili vita,\r\nlingua mea et os meum non cessabunt pronuntiare laudem et honorem\r\nomnipotentis Dei.' Quo audito jussit [imperator] durissimos stipites\r\nparari et in igne duros fieri et praeacutos ut sic dentes ejus et per\r\ntales stipites laederent, radices dentium cum forcipe everentur\r\nradicitus. In illa hora oravit S. Apollinia dicens: 'Domine Jesu\r\nChriste, precor te ut quicumque diem passionis meae devote peregerint ...\r\ndolorem dentium aut capitis nunquam sentiant passiones.'\" The angels\r\nthereupon (seated on wooden stairs, in Fouquet's miniature) come down\r\nand tell her that her prayer has been granted. \"Acta ut videntur\r\napocrypha S.

Not far\r\nfrom him sleep the Plantagenet kings, his patrons, Edward III. and\r\nRichard II. wrapped in their golden robes. With them an epoch has drawn\r\nto its close; a new century begins, and this century is, for English\r\nthought, a century of decline, of repose, and of preparation.\r\n\r\nSo evident is the decline that even contemporaries perceive it; for a\r\nhundred years poets unceasingly mourn the death of Chaucer. They are no\r\nlonger able to discover new ways; instead of looking forward as their\r\nmaster did, they turn, and stand with eyes fixed on him, and hands\r\noutstretched towards his tomb. An age seeking its ideal in the epoch\r\nthat has just preceded it is an age of decline; so had been in past\r\ntimes the age of Statius, who had professed such a deep veneration for\r\nVirgil.\r\n\r\nFor a century thus the poets of England remain with their gaze fastened\r\non the image of the singer they last heard, and at each generation their\r\nvoice becomes weaker, like an echo that repeats another echo. Lydgate\r\nimitates Chaucer, and Stephen Hawes imitates Lydgate.[826]\r\n\r\nAround and below them countless rhymers persist in following the old\r\npaths, not knowing that these paths have ceased to lead anywhere, and\r\nthat the time has come to search for new ones. The most skilful add to\r\nthe series of English fabliaux, borrowed from France; others put into\r\nrhyme, disfiguring them as they go along, romances of chivalry, lives of\r\nthe saints, or chronicles of England and Scotland. Very numerous, nearly\r\nall devoid of talent, these patient, indefatigable word-joiners write in\r\nreality, they too, as M. Jourdain, \"de la prose sans le savoir.\"[827]\r\n\r\nThese poets of the decline write for a society itself on the decline,\r\nand all move along, lulled by the same melody to a common death, out of\r\nwhich will come a new life that they can never know. The old feudal and\r\nclerical aristocracy changes, disappears, and decays; many of the great\r\nhouses become extinct in the wars with France, or in the fierce battles\r\nof the Two Roses; the people gain by what the aristocracy lose. The\r\nclergy who keep aloof from military conflicts are also torn by\r\ninternecine quarrels; they live in luxury; abuses publicly pointed out\r\nare not reformed; they are an object of envy to the prince and of scorn\r\nto the lower classes; they find themselves in the most dangerous\r\nsituation, and do nothing to escape from it. Of warnings they have no\r\nlack; they receive no new endowments; they slumber; at the close of the\r\ncentury nothing will remain to them but an immense and frail dwelling,\r\nbuilt on the sand, that a storm can blow over.\r\n\r\nHow innovate when versifying for a society about to end? Chaucer's\r\nsuccessors do not innovate; they fasten their work to his works, and\r\npatch them together; they build in the shadow of his palace. They dream\r\nthe same dreams on a May morning; they erect new Houses of Fame; they\r\nadd a story to the \"Canterbury Tales.\"[828]\r\n\r\nA gift bestowed on them by a spiteful fairy makes the matter worse: they\r\nare incredibly prolific. All they write is poor, and the spiteful fairy,\r\nspiteful to us, has granted them the faculty to write thus, without any\r\ntrouble, for ever. Up to this day Lydgate's works have baffled the\r\nattempts of the most enterprising literary societies; the Early English\r\nText Society has some time ago begun to publish them; if it carries out\r\nthe undertaking, it will be a proof of unparalleled endurance.\r\n\r\nLydgate and Hoccleve are the two principal successors of Chaucer.\r\nLydgate, a monk of the monastery of Bury St. Edmund's,[829] a worthy\r\nman, it seems, if ever there was one, and industrious, and prolific,\r\nabove all prolific, writes according to established standards, tales,\r\nlays,[830] fabliaux satires,[831] romances of chivalry, poetical\r\ndebates, ballads of former times,[832] allegories, lives of the saints,\r\nlove poems, fables[833]; five thousand verses a year on an average, and\r\nbeing precocious as well as prolific, leaves behind him at his death a\r\nhundred and thirty thousand verses, merely counting his longer works.\r\nVirgil had only written fourteen thousand.\r\n\r\nHe copies Latin, French, and English models, but especially\r\nChaucer,[834] he adds his \"Story of Thebes\"[835] to the series of the\r\n\"Canterbury Tales,\" he has met, he says, the pilgrims on their homeward\r\njourney; the host asked him who he was:\r\n\r\n    I answerde my name was Lydgate,\r\n    Monk of Bery, nygh fyfty yere of age.\r\n\r\nAdmitted into the little community, he contributes to the entertainment\r\nby telling a tale of war, of love, and of valorous deeds, in which the\r\nGreeks wear knightly armour, are blessed by bishops, and batter town\r\nwalls with cannon. His \"Temple of Glas\"[836] is an imitation of the\r\n\"Hous of Fame\"; his \"Complaint of the Black Knight\" resembles the \"Book\r\nof the Duchesse\"; his \"Falle of Princes\"[837] is imitated from Boccaccio\r\nand from the tale of the Monk in Chaucer. The \"litel hevynesse\" which\r\nthe knight noticed in the monk's stories is particularly well imitated,\r\nso much so that Lydgate himself stops sometimes with uplifted pen to\r\nyawn at his ease in the face of his reader.[838] But his pen goes down\r\nagain on the paper, and starts off with fresh energy. From it proceeds a\r\n\"Troy Book, or Historie of the Warres betwixte the Grecians and the\r\nTroyans,\" of thirty thousand lines, where pasteboard warriors hew each\r\nother to pieces without suffering much pain or causing us much\r\nsorrow[839]; a translation of that same \"Pelerinage\" of Deguileville,\r\nwhich had inspired Langland; a Guy of Warwick[840]; Lives of Our Lady,\r\nof St. Margaret, St. Edmund, St. Alban; a \"pageant\" for the entry of\r\nQueen Margaret into London in 1445; a version of the \"Secretum\r\nSecretorum,\" and a multitude of other writings.[841] Nothing but death\r\ncould stop him; and, his last poem being of 1446, his biographers have\r\nunanimously concluded that he must have died in that year.\r\n\r\nThe rules of his prosody were rather lax. No one will be surprised at\r\nit; he could say like Ovid, but for other reasons: \"I had but to write,\r\nand it was verses.\" He is ready for everything; order them, and you will\r\nhave at once verses to order. These verses are slightly deformed, maybe,\r\nand halt somewhat; he does not deny it:\r\n\r\n    I toke none hede nouther of shorte nor longe.[842]\r\n\r\nBut let us not blame him; Chaucer, his good master, would, he assures\r\nus, have excused his faulty prosody, and what right have we to be more\r\nsevere than Chaucer?[843] To this there is, of course, nothing to\r\nanswer, but then if we cannot answer, at least we can leave. We can go\r\nand visit the other chief poet of the time, Thomas Hoccleve; he does not\r\nlive far off, the journey will be a short one; we have but to call at\r\nthe next door.\r\n\r\nThis other poet is a public functionary; he is a clerk of the Privy\r\nSeal[844]; his duties consist in copying documents; an occupation he\r\nfinds at length somewhat tiresome.[845] By way of diversion he frequents\r\ntaverns; women wait on him there, and he kisses them; a wicked deed, he\r\nadmits; but he goes no further; at least so he assures us, being\r\ndoubtless held back by a remembrance of officialdom and promotion.[846]\r\nAt all events this little was even too much, for we soon find him sick\r\nunto death, rhyming supplications to the god of health, and to Lord\r\nFournivall, another kind of god, very useful to propitiate, for he was\r\nLord Treasurer. He writes a good many detached pieces in which, thanks\r\nto his mania for talking about himself, he makes us acquainted with the\r\nnooks and corners of the old city, thus supplying rare and curious\r\ninformation, treasured by the historian. He composes, in order to make\r\nhimself noticed by the king, a lengthy poem on the Government of\r\nPrinces, \"De Regimine Principum,\" which is nothing but a compilation\r\ntaken from three or four previous treatises; he adds a prologue, and in\r\nit, following the example of Gower, he abuses all classes of society. He\r\ndoes not fail to begin his confession over again: from which we gather\r\nthat he is something of a drunkard and of a coward, that he is vain\r\nwithal and somewhat ill-natured.\r\n\r\nHe had, however, one merit, and, in spite of his defects, all lovers of\r\nliterature ought to be grateful to him; the best of his works is not his\r\nGovernment of Princes; it is a drawing. He not only, like Lydgate, loved\r\nand mourned Chaucer, but wished to keep the memory of his features, and\r\nhe caused to be painted on the margin of a manuscript the portrait\r\nmentioned above, which agrees so well with the descriptions contained in\r\nthe writings of the master that there is no doubt as to the\r\nlikeness.[847]\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nLet us cross the hills, and we shall still find Chaucer; as in England,\r\nso is he wept and imitated in Scotland. But the poets live there in a\r\ndifferent atmosphere; the imitation is not so close a one; a greater\r\nproportion of a Celtic blood maintains differences; more originality\r\nsurvives; the decline is less apparent. The best poets of English\r\ntongue, \"Inglis\" as they call it, \"oure Inglis,\" Dunbar says, are, in\r\nthe fifteenth century, Scots. Among them are a king, a monk, a\r\nschoolmaster, a minstrel, a bishop.\r\n\r\nThe king is James I., son of Robert III., of the family of those Stuarts\r\nnearly all of whom were destined to the most tragic fate. This one,\r\ntaken at sea by the English, when only a child, remained nineteen years\r\nconfined in various castles. Like a knight of romance, and a personage\r\nin a miniature, he shortened the hours of his captivity by music,\r\nreading, and poetry; the works of Chaucer and Gower filled him with\r\nadmiration. Then he found a better comfort for his sorrows; this knight\r\nof miniature and of romance saw before him one day the maiden so often\r\npainted by illuminators, the one who appears amidst the flowers and the\r\ndew, Aucassin's Nicolette, the Emily of the Knight's Tale, the one who\r\nbrings happiness. She appeared to the king, not in a dream but in\r\nreality; her name was Jane Beaufort, she was the daughter of the Earl of\r\nSomerset, and great grand-daughter of John of Gaunt. In her family, too,\r\nthere were many tragic destinies; her brother was killed at the battle\r\nof St. Albans; her three nephews perished in the Wars of the Roses; her\r\ngrand-nephew won the battle of Bosworth and became king Henry VII. A\r\nmutual love sprang up between the two young people, and when James was\r\nable to return to Scotland he took back with him his queen of romance,\r\nwhom he had wedded before the altar of St. Mary Overy's, next to the\r\ngrave of one of his literary masters, the poet Gower.\r\n\r\nHis reign lasted thirteen years, and they were thirteen years of\r\nstruggle: vain endeavours to regulate and centralise a kingdom composed\r\nof independent clans, all brave and ready for foreign wars, but quite as\r\nready, too, for civil ones. Assisted by his queen of romance, the\r\nknightly poet displayed in this task an uncommon energy, and was, with\r\nall his faults, one of the best kings of Scotland. He had many children;\r\none of his daughters became dauphiness of France, and another duchess of\r\nBrittany. Towards the end of 1436, he had so many enemies among the\r\nturbulent chieftains that sinister prophecies began to circulate; one of\r\nthem announced the speedy death of a king; and as he played at chess on\r\nChristmas eve with a knight surnamed the \"king of love,\" he said to him:\r\n\"There are no other kings in Scotland save me and you; I take heed to\r\nmyself, do you likewise.\" But the king of love had nothing to fear.\r\nDuring the night of the 20th of February, 1437, an unwonted noise was\r\nsuddenly heard in the courtyard of the monastery of Perth where James\r\nlodged; it was Robert Graham and his rebel band. Vainly did the king\r\noffer resistance, though unarmed; the foe were too numerous, and they\r\nstretched him dead, pierced with sixteen sword wounds.\r\n\r\nThe constant love of the king for Jane Beaufort had been celebrated by\r\nhimself in an allegorical poem, imitated from Chaucer: \"The King's\r\nQuhair,\" a poem all aglow with bright hues and with the freshness of\r\nyouth.[848] The prince is in bed at night, and, like Chaucer in his poem\r\nof the Duchess, unable to sleep, he takes up a book. It is the\r\n\"Consolation\" of Boethius, and the meditations of \"that noble senatoure\"\r\nwho had also known great reverses, occupied his thoughts while the night\r\nhours glided on. The silence is broken by the matin bell:\r\n\r\n        Bot now, how trowe ye? suich a fantasye\r\n    Fell me to mynd, that ay me-thoght the bell\r\n    Said to me: \"Tell on, man, quhat the befell.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the king, invoking Clio and Polymnia, like Chaucer, and adding\r\nTysiphone whom he takes for a Muse, because he is less familiar with\r\nmythology than Chaucer, tells what befell him, how he parted with his\r\nfriends, when quite a boy, was imprisoned in a foreign land, and from\r\nthe window of his tower discovered one day in the garden:\r\n\r\n    The fairest or the freschest yong floure\r\n    That ever I sawe.\r\n\r\nThe maid was so beautiful that all at once his \"hert became hir thrall\":\r\n\r\n    A! suete, are ye a warldly creature,\r\n    Or hevinly thing in likenesse of nature?\r\n\r\nTo be cleared from his doubts the royal poet ventures into the kingdom\r\nof Venus, and finds her stretched on her couch, her white shoulders\r\ncovered with \"ane huke,\" a loose dress that Chaucer had not placed upon\r\nthem. Then he reaches the kingdom of Minerva; and passing through\r\ndissertations, beds of flowers, and groups of stars, he returns to\r\nearth, reassured as to his fate, with the certitude of a happiness\r\npromised him both by Venus and Minerva. A eulogy on Gower and Chaucer\r\ncloses the poem, which is written in stanzas of seven lines, since\r\ncalled, because of James, \"Rhyme Royal.\"[849]\r\n\r\nBlind Harry, the minstrel, sings the popular hero, William Wallace.[850]\r\nWe are in the midst of legends. Wallace causes Edward I. to tremble in\r\nLondon; he runs extraordinary dangers and has wonderful escapes; he\r\nslays; he is slain; he recovers; his body is thrown over the castle\r\nwall, and picked up by his old nurse; the daughter of the nurse, nurse\r\nherself, revives the corpse with her milk. The language is simple,\r\ndirect and plain; the interest lies in the facts, and not in the manner\r\nin which they are told; and this, to say the truth, is also the case\r\nwith chap-books.\r\n\r\nBlind Harry continues Barbour rather than Chaucer, but Chaucer resumes\r\nhis rights as an ancestor with Henryson and Dunbar. The former[851] sits\r\nwith his feet to the fire one winter's night, takes \"ane drink\" to cheer\r\nhim, and \"Troilus\" to while away the time. The little homely scene is\r\ndescribed in charming fashion; one seems, while reading, to feel the\r\nwarmth of the cosy corner, the warmth even of the \"drink,\" for it must\r\nhave been a warm one:\r\n\r\n    I mend the fyre, and beikit (basked) me about,\r\n      Than tuik ane drink my spreitis to comfort,\r\n    And armit me weill fra the cold thairout;\r\n      To cut the winter nicht and mak it schort,\r\n      I tuik ane quair and left all uther sport,\r\n    Writtin be worthie Chaucer glorious\r\n    Of fair Cresseid and worthie Troilus.\r\n\r\nHe read, but unable to understand the master's leniency towards the\r\nfrail and deceitful woman, he takes pen and adds a canto to the poem:\r\nthe \"Testament of Cresseid,\" where he makes her die a dreadful death,\r\nforsaken by all.\r\n\r\nA greater pleasure will be taken in his rustic poems, ballads, or\r\nfables. His \"Robene and Makyne\" is a \"disputoison\" between a shepherd\r\nand shepherdess. Makyne loves Robin, and tells him so; and he\r\naccordingly cares not for her. Makyne goes off, her eyes full of tears;\r\nbut Robin is no sooner left alone than he begins to love:\r\n\r\n    Makyne, the nicht is soft and dry,\r\n      The weddir is warme and fair\r\n    And the grene woid rycht neir us by\r\n      To walk atour (over) all quhair (everywhere);\r\n    Thair ma na janglour us espy\r\n      That is to lufe contrair;\r\n    Thairin, Makyne, bath ye and I\r\n      Unsene we ma repair.\r\n\r\nIn her turn Makyne is no longer willing; she laughs now, and he weeps,\r\nand she leaves him in solitude under a rock, with his sheep. This is a\r\nlamentable ending; but let us not sorrow overmuch; on these pathless\r\nmoors people are sure to meet, and since they quarrelled and parted for\r\never, in the fifteenth century, Robin and Makyne have met many times.\r\n\r\nAnother day, Henryson has a dream, after the fashion of the Middle Ages.\r\nIn summer-time, among the flowers, a personage appears to him,\r\n\r\n    His hude of scarlet, bordowrit weill with silk.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the dress he is a Roman: \"My native land is Rome;\" and this\r\nRoman turns out to be AEsop, \"poet laureate;\" there is no room for doubt:\r\nwe are in the Middle Ages. AEsop recites his fables in such a new and\r\ngraceful manner, with such a pleasing mixture of truth and fancy, that\r\nhe never told them better, not even when he was a Greek slave, and saved\r\nhis head by his wit.\r\n\r\nHenryson takes his time; he observes animals and nature, and departs as\r\nmuch as possible from the epigrammatic form common to most fabulists.\r\nThe story of the \"uplandis Mous and the burges Mous,\" so often related,\r\nhas never been better told than by Henryson, and this can be affirmed\r\nwithout forgetting La Fontaine.\r\n\r\nThe two mice are sisters; the elder, a mouse of importance, established\r\nin town, well fed on flour and cheese, remembers, one day, her little\r\nsister, and starts off at dusk to visit her. She follows lonely paths at\r\nnight, creeps through the moss and heather of the interminable Scottish\r\nbogs, and at last arrives. The dwelling strikes her as strangely\r\nmiserable, frail, and dark; a poor little thief like the younger sister\r\ndoes not care much about burning dips. Nevertheless, great is the joy at\r\nmeeting; the \"uplandis mous\" produces her choicest stores; the \"burges\r\nmous\" looks on, unable to quite conceal her astonishment. Is it not\r\nnice? inquires the little sister. Excuse me, replies the other, but:\r\n\r\n    Thir widderit (withered) peis and nuttis, or thay be bord,\r\n    Will brek my teith and make my wame full sklender....\r\n    Sister, this victuall and your royal feist\r\n    May well suffice unto ane rurall beist.\r\n\r\n    Lat be this hole, and cum in-to my place,\r\n      I sall to yow schaw be experience\r\n    My Gude-fryday is better nor your Pace (Easter).\r\n\r\nAnd off they trot through the bushes, and through those heathery bogs\r\nwhich have by turns charmed and wearied many others besides mice.\r\n\r\nThey reach the elder sister's. There are delicious provisions, cheese,\r\nbutter, malt, fish, and dishes without number.\r\n\r\n      And lordis fair thus couth thay counterfeit,\r\n    Except ane thing: thay drank the watter cleir\r\n    Instead of wyne; bot yit thay maid gude cheir.\r\n\r\nThe little sister admires and nibbles. But how long will this last?\r\nAlways, says the other. Just at that moment a rattle of keys is heard;\r\nit is the _spenser_ coming to the pantry. A dreadful scene! The great\r\nmouse runs to her hole, and the little one, not knowing where to hide\r\nherself, faints.\r\n\r\nLuckily, the man was in a hurry; he takes what he came for, and departs.\r\nThe elder mouse creeps out of her hole:\r\n\r\n    How fair ye sister? cry peip quhair-ever ye be.\r\n\r\nThe other, half dead with fright, and shaking in her four paws, is\r\nunable to answer. The great mouse warms and comforts her: 'tis all over,\r\ndo not fear;\r\n\r\n    Cum to your meit, this perell is overpast.\r\n\r\nBut no, it is not all over, for now comes \"Gilbert\" (for Tybert, the\r\nname of the cat in the \"Roman de Renart\"), \"our jolie cat\"; another rout\r\nensues. This time, perched on a partition where Tybert cannot reach her,\r\nthe field mouse takes leave of her sister, makes her escape, goes back\r\nto the country, and finds there her poverty, her peas, her nuts, and her\r\ntranquillity.\r\n\r\nThe mouse of Scotland has been fortunate in her painters; another, and a\r\nstill better portrait was to be made of the \"wee, sleekit, cowrin,\r\ntim'rous beastie,\" by the great poet of the nation, Robert Burns.\r\n\r\nWith Gavin Douglas, bishop of Dunkeld, of the illustrious house of the\r\nDouglas, earls of Angus, the translator of Virgil, and with William\r\nDunbar, a mendicant friar, favourite of James IV., sent by him on\r\nmissions to London and Paris, we cross the threshold of a new century;\r\nthey die in the midst of the Renaissance, but with them, nevertheless,\r\nthe Chaucerian tradition is continued. Douglas writes a \"Palice of\r\nHonour,\" imitated from Chaucer.[852] Dunbar,[853] with never flagging\r\nspirit, attempts every style; he composes sentimental allegories and\r\ncoarse tales (very coarse indeed), satires, parodies, laments.[854] His\r\nfits of melancholy do not last long; he must be ill to be sad; however\r\nkeen his satires, they are the work of an optimist; they end with\r\nlaughter and not with tears. He is nearer to Jean des Entommeures than\r\nto William Langland.\r\n\r\nHis principal poems, \"The Goldyn Targe,\" on the targe or shield of\r\nReason exposed to the shafts of Love; \"Thrissil and the Rois\" (thistle\r\nand rose) are close imitations of the Chaucer of the \"Parlement of\r\nFoules\" and of the \"Hous of Fame,\" with the same allegories, the same\r\nabstract personages, the same flowers, and the same perfumes. The\r\n\"Thrissil and the Rois,\" written about 1503, celebrates the marriage of\r\nMargaret, rose of England, daughter of Henry VII., to James IV., thistle\r\nof Scotland, the flower with a purple crown: that famous marriage which\r\nwas to result in a union of both countries under the same sceptre.\r\n\r\nEndowed with an ever-ready mind and an unfailing power of invention,\r\nDunbar, following his natural tastes, and wishing, at the same time, to\r\nimitate Chaucer, decks his pictures with glaring colours, and\r\n\"out-Chaucers Chaucer.\" His flowers are too flowery, his odours too\r\nfragrant; by moments it is no longer a delight, but almost a pain. It is\r\nnot sufficient that his birds should sing, they must sing among\r\nperfumes, and these perfumes are coloured; they sing\r\n\r\n    Amang the tendir odouris reid and quhyt.[855]\r\n\r\nThese are undoubted signs of decline; they are found, in different\r\ndegrees, among the poets of England and of Scotland, nearly without\r\nexception. The anonymous poems, \"The Flower and the Leaf,\" \"The Court of\r\nLove,\" &c.,[856] imitated from Chaucer, exhibit the same symptoms. The\r\nonly ones who escape are, chiefly in the region of the Scottish border,\r\nthose unknown singers who derive their inspiration directly from the\r\npeople, who leave books alone, and who would not be found, like\r\nHenryson, sitting by the fireside with \"Troilus\" on their knees. These\r\nsingers remodel in their turn ballads that will be remade after\r\nthem,[857] and which have come down stirring and touching; love-songs,\r\ndoleful ditties, the ride of the Percy and the Douglas[858] (\"Chevy\r\nChase\"), that, in spite of his classic tastes, Philip Sidney admired in\r\nthe time of Elizabeth. Though declining in castles, poetry still thrills\r\nwith youth along the hedges and in the copses; and the best works of\r\npoets with a name like Dunbar or Henryson are those in which are found\r\nan echo of the songs of the woods and moors. This same echo lends its\r\ncharm to the music of the \"Nut-brown Maid,\"[859] that exquisite\r\nlove-duo, a combination of popular and artistic poetry written by a\r\nnameless author, towards the end of the period, and the finest of the\r\n\"disputoisons\" in English literature.\r\n\r\nBut apart from the songs the wayfarer hums along the lanes, the works of\r\nthe poets most appreciated at that time, Lydgate, Henryson, Dunbar,\r\nStephen Hawes,[860] represent a dying art; they write as architects\r\nbuild, and their literature is a florid one; their poems are in Henry\r\nVII.'s style. Their roses are splendid, but too full-blown; they have\r\nexpended all their strength, all their beauty, all their fragrance; no\r\nstore of youth is left to them; they have given it all away; and what\r\nhappens to such roses? They shed their leaves; of this past glory there\r\nwill soon remain nothing save a stalk without petals.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nThe end of the feudal world has come, its literature is dying out; but\r\nat the same time a double revival is preparing. The revival most\r\ndifficult to follow, but not the least considerable, originated in the\r\nmiddle and lower classes of society. While great families destroy each\r\nother, humble ones thrive: only lately has this fact been sufficiently\r\nnoticed. So long as the historian was only interested in battles and in\r\nroyal quarrels, the fifteenth century in England was considered by every\r\none, except by that keen observer, Commines, to be the time of the war\r\nof the Two Roses, of the murder of Edward's children, and nothing else.\r\nIt seemed as though the blood of the youthful princes had stained the\r\nentire century, and as if the whole nation, stunned with horror, had\r\nremained aghast and immobile. Curiosity has been felt in our days as to\r\nwhether this impression was a correct one, and it has been ascertained\r\nto be false. Instead of being absorbed in the contemplation of these\r\ndreadful struggles, holding its breath at the sight of the slaughter,\r\nthe nation paid very little attention to them, and regarded these doings\r\nin the light of \"res inter alios acta.\"\r\n\r\nFeudalism was perishing, as human organisations often perish, from the\r\nvery fact of its having attained its full development; feudal nobles had\r\nso long towered above the people that they were now almost completely\r\nsevered from them; feudalism had pushed its principle so far that it was\r\nabout to die, like the over-blown roses of Dunbar. While the nobles and\r\ntheir followers, that crowd of _bravi_ that the statutes against\r\nmaintenance had vainly tried to suppress, strewed the fields of\r\nWakefield, Towton, and Tewkesbury with their corpses, the real nation,\r\nthe mass of the people, stood apart and was engaged in a far different\r\noccupation. It strove to enrich itself, and was advancing by degrees\r\ntowards equality between citizens. A perusal of the innumerable\r\ndocuments of that epoch, which have been preserved and which concern\r\nmiddle classes, leave a decided impression of peaceful development, of\r\nloosening of bondage, of a diffusion of comfort. The time is becoming\r\nmore remote, when some sat on thrones and others on the ground; it\r\nbegins to be suspected that one day perhaps there may be chairs for\r\neverybody. In the course of an examination bearing on thousands of\r\ndocuments, Thorold Rogers found but two allusions to the civil\r\nwars.[861] The duration of these wars must not, besides, be exaggerated;\r\nby adding one period of hostilities to another it will be found they\r\nlasted three years in all.\r\n\r\nThe boundaries between the classes are less strictly guarded; war helps\r\nto cross them; soldiers of fortune are ennobled; merchants likewise. The\r\nimportance of trade goes on increasing; even a king, Edward IV., makes\r\nattempts at trading, and does not fear thus to derogate; English ships\r\nare now larger, more numerous, and sail farther. The house of the\r\nCanynges of Bristol has in its pay eight hundred sailors; its trading\r\nnavy counts a _Mary Canynge_ and a _Mary and John_, which exceed in size\r\nall that has hitherto been seen. A duke of Bedford is degraded from the\r\npeerage because he has no money, and a nobleman without money is tempted\r\nto become a dangerous freebooter and live at the expense of others.[862]\r\nFor the progress is noticeable only by comparison, and, without speaking\r\nof open wars, brigandage, which is dying out, is not yet quite extinct.\r\n\r\nThe literature of the time corroborates the testimony of documents\r\nexhumed from ancient muniment rooms. It gives an impression of a\r\nwealthier nation than formerly, counting more free men, with a more\r\nextensive trade. The number of books on courtesy, etiquette, good\r\nbreeding, good cooking, politeness, with an injunction not to take\r\n\"always\" the whole of the best morsel,[863] is a sign of these\r\nimprovements. The letters of the Paston family are another.[864] In\r\nspite of all the mentions made in these letters of violent and barbarous\r\ndeeds; though in them we see Margaret Paston and her twelve defenders\r\nput to flight by an enemy of the family, and Sir John Paston besieged in\r\nhis castle of Caister by the duke of Norfolk, a multitude of details\r\ngive something of a modern character to this collection, the oldest\r\nseries of private English letters we possess.\r\n\r\nIn spite of aristocratic alliances, these people think and write like\r\nworthy citizens, economical, practical and careful. During her husband's\r\nabsence, Margaret Paston keeps him informed of all that goes on, she\r\nlooks after his property, renews leases, collects rents. Reading her\r\nletters one seems to see her home as neat and clean as a Dutch house. If\r\na disaster occurs, instead of wasting her time in lamentations, she\r\nrepairs it to the best of her ability and takes precautions for the\r\nfuture. She loves her husband, and may be believed when, knowing him to\r\nbe ill, she writes: \"I would ye were at home, if it were your ease, and\r\nyour sore might be as well looked to here as it is where ye be, now\r\nliefer than a gown though it were of scarlet.\"[865] John Paston, shut in\r\nthe Fleet prison, where he makes the acquaintance of Lord Henry Percy,\r\nfor prisons were then a place where the best society met, sends\r\nMargaret playful verses to amuse her:\r\n\r\n    My lord Persy and all this house,\r\n    Recommend them to yow, dogge catte and mowse,\r\n    And wysshe ye had be here stille,\r\n    For they sey ye are a good gille.\r\n\r\nThe old and new times are no longer so far apart; in such a prison,\r\nFielding and Sheridan would not have felt out of place.[866]\r\n\r\nBooks of advice to travellers, itineraries or guides to foreign\r\nparts,[867] vocabularies, dictionaries, and grammars,[868] commercial\r\nguides, the \"Libelle of Englyshe Polycye,\"[869] are also signs of the\r\ntimes. This last document is a characteristic one; it is a sort of\r\nconsular report in verse, very similar (the verses excepted) to\r\nthousands of consular reports with which \"Livres Jaunes\" and \"Blue\r\nBooks\" have since been filled. The author points out for each country\r\nthe goods to be imported and exported, and the guileful practices to be\r\nfeared in foreign parts; he insists on the necessity of England's having\r\na strong navy, and exaggerates the maritime power of rival countries, so\r\nthat Parliament may vote the necessary supplies. England should be the\r\nfirst on the sea, and able to impose \"pease by auctorite.\" She should\r\nestablish herself more firmly at Calais; only the word Calais would be\r\naltered now and replaced by Gibraltar, Malta, Cyprus, or the Cape. The\r\nauthor enumerates the products of Prussia, Flanders, France, Spain,\r\nPortugal, Genoa, &c.; he has even information on the subject of Iceland,\r\nand its great cod-fish trade. He wishes for a spirited colonial policy;\r\nit is not yet a question of India, but only of Ireland; at any price\r\n\"the wylde Iryshe\" must be conquered.\r\n\r\nHe dwells at length on the misdeeds of the wicked Malouins, who are\r\nstopped by nothing, obey no one, and are protected by the innumerable\r\nrocks of their bays, amidst which they alone know the passages.\r\nConclusion:\r\n\r\n    Kepte (keep) than the see about in specialle\r\n    Whiche of England is the rounde walle;\r\n    As thoughe England were lykened to a cite,\r\n    And the walle enviroun were the see;\r\n    Keep than the see that is the walle of Englond,\r\n    And then is Englond kepte by Goddes sonde.\r\n\r\nThe anxious injunctions scattered in the \"Libelle\" must not be taken,\r\nany more than Parliamentary speeches of later date, as implying that the\r\nnation had no confidence in itself. The instinct of nationality,\r\nformerly so vague, has grown from year to year since the Conquest: the\r\nEnglish are now proud of everything English; they are proud of their\r\nnavy, in spite of its defects; of their army, in spite of the reverses\r\nit suffered; of the wealth of the Commons; they even boast of their\r\nrobbers. Anything one does should be well done; if they have thieves,\r\nthese thieves will prove the best in the world. The testimony of Sir\r\nJohn Fortescue, knight, Lord Chief Justice, and Chancellor of England,\r\nwho must have known about the thieves, is decisive on this point. He\r\nwrites, in English prose, a treatise on absolute and limited\r\nmonarchy[870]; admiration for his country breaks out on every page. It\r\nis the time of the Two Roses, but it matters little with him; like many\r\nothers in his day, he does not pay while writing much attention to the\r\nRoses. England is the best governed country in the world; it has the\r\nbest laws; the king can do nothing unless his people consent. In this\r\nmanner a just balance is maintained: \"Our Comons be riche, and therfor\r\nthey gave to their kyng, at sum tymys quinsimes and dismes, and often\r\ntymys other grete subsydyes.... This might thay not have done, if they\r\nhad ben empoveryshyd by their kyng, as the Comons of Fraunce.\" Fortescue\r\nputs forth a theory often confirmed since then: if the Commons rebel\r\nsometimes, it is not the pride of wealth that makes them, but tyranny;\r\nfor, were they poor, revolts would be far more frequent: \"If thay be not\r\npoer, thay will never aryse, but if their prince so leve Justice, that\r\nhe gyve hymself al to tyrannye.\" It is true that the Commons of France\r\ndo not rebel (Louis XI. then reigned at Plessis-lez-Tours); Fortescue is\r\nshocked at that, and remonstrates against their \"lacke of harte.\"\r\n\r\nSome people might say that there are a great many thieves in England.\r\nThey are numerous, Fortescue confesses, there is no doubt as to that;\r\nbut the country finds in them one more cause to be proud: \"It hath ben\r\noften seen in Englond that three or four thefes, for povertie hath sett\r\nupon seven or eight true men and robbyd them al.\" The thieves of France\r\nare incapable of such admirable boldness. On this account \"it is right\r\nseld that French men be hangyd for robberye,\" says Fortescue, who had\r\nnever, judging by the way he talks, passed by Montfaucon, nor come\r\nacross poor Villon; \"thay have no hertys to do so terryble an acte.\r\nThere be therfor mo men hangyd in Englonde in a yere for robberye and\r\nmanslaughter than their be hangid in Fraunce for such cause of crime in\r\nseven yers.\"[871] As a judge, Fortescue hangs the thieves; as an\r\nEnglishman he admires their performances: the national robber is\r\nsuperior to all others. An engraving in _Punch_ represents a London\r\ndrunkard carried off by two policemen; the street boys make comments:\r\n\"They couldn't take my Father up like that,\" says one of them, \"it takes\r\nsix Policemen to run him in!\" If this boy ever becomes Chief Justice, he\r\nwill write, in the same spirit, another treatise like Fortescue's.\r\n\r\nThus is popularised in that century the art of prose; the uses made of\r\nit are not unprecedented, but they are far more frequent. This is one\r\nmore sign that the nation settles and concentrates; does not stand on\r\ntiptoe, but sits comfortably. Previous examples are followed; there are\r\nschools of prose writers as of poets. Bishop Pecock employs Wyclif's\r\nirony to defend what Wyclif had attacked; pilgrimages, friars, the\r\npossessions of the clergy, the statues and paintings in churches.[872]\r\nHis forcible eloquence is embittered by sarcasms; he continues a\r\ntradition, dear to the English race, and one which, constantly renewed,\r\nwill come down to Swift and to the humourists of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. Boiling over with passion, he does his best to speak coldly and\r\nwithout moving a finger. Wyclif wants everything to be found in the\r\nBible, and forbids pilgrimages, which are not spoken of in it. But then,\r\nsays Pecock, we are greatly puzzled, for how should we dare to wear\r\nbreeches, which the Bible does not mention either? How justify the use\r\nof clocks to know the hour? And with great seriousness, in a calm voice,\r\nhe discusses the question: \"For though in eeldist daies, and though in\r\nScripture, mensioun is maad of orologis, schewing the houris of the dai\r\nbi the schadew maad bi the sunne in a cercle, certis nevere, save in\r\nlate daies, was eny clok telling the houris of the dai and nyht bi peise\r\nand bi stroke; and open it is that noughwhere in holi scripture is\r\nexpresse mensioun made of eny suche.\" Where does the Bible say that it\r\nshould be translated into English?[873] In the same tone of voice Wyclif\r\nhad pointed out, in the preceding century, the abuses of the Church; in\r\nthe same tone of voice the author of \"Gulliver\" will point out, three\r\ncenturies later, the happy use that might be made of Irish children as\r\nbutcher's meat.\r\n\r\nThe thing to be remembered for the moment is that the number of\r\nprose-writers increases. They write more abundantly than formerly; they\r\ntranslate old treatises; they unveil the mysteries of hunting, fishing,\r\nand heraldry; they compose chronicles; they rid the language of its\r\nstiffness. To this contributes Sir Thomas Malory, with his compilation\r\ncalled \"Morte d'Arthur,\" in which he includes the whole cycle of\r\nBritain. The work was published by Caxton, the first English printer,\r\nwho was also a prose-writer.[874] They even write on love; prose now\r\nretaliates upon verse, and trespasses on the domains of poetry.[875]\r\n\r\nThe diminished importance of the nobles and of the feudal aristocracy,\r\nthe increased importance of the citizens and of the working class, bring\r\nthe various elements of the nation nearer to each other, and this fact\r\nwill have a considerable effect on literature: the day will come when\r\nthe same author can address the whole audience and write for the whole\r\nnation. In a hundred years it will be necessary to take into\r\nconsideration the judgment of the English people, both \"high men\" and\r\n\"low men,\" on intellectual things; there will stand in the pit a mob\r\nwhose declared tastes and exigences will cause the most stubborn of the\r\nElizabethan poets to yield. Ben Jonson will be less classic and more\r\nEnglish than he would have liked to be; he intended to introduce a\r\nchorus into his tragedy of \"Sejanus\"; the fear of the pit prevented him;\r\nhe grumbles, but submits.[876] The thrift and the toil of the English\r\npeasant and craftsman in the fifteenth century had thus an unexpected\r\ninfluence on literature: they contributed to form an audience for\r\nShakespeare.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nThe new times are preparing, in still another manner; the gods are to\r\ncome down from Olympus and dwell once more among men.\r\n\r\nWhile the ancient literature is dying out, another is growing which is\r\nto replace it in France, but which will continue it, transformed and\r\nrejuvenated, in England. Rome and Athens will give England a signal, not\r\nlaws; but this signal is an important one; happy the nations who have\r\nheard it; it was the signal for awakening.\r\n\r\nIn that Italy visited by Chaucer in the fourteenth century, the passion\r\nfor antiquity goes on increasing; the Latins no longer suffice, the\r\nGreeks must be known. Petrarch worshipped a manuscript of Homer, but it\r\nwas for him a dumb fetish: the fetish has now become a god, and utters\r\noracles that all the world understands. The city of the Greek emperors\r\nis still standing, and there letters shine with a last lustre. While the\r\nfoe is at its gates, it rectifies its grammars, goes back to origins,\r\nrejects new words, and revives the ancient language of Demosthenes.\r\nNever had the town of Constantine been more Greek than on the eve of its\r\ndestruction.[877] The fame of its rhetoricians is spread abroad; men\r\ncome from Italy to hear John Argyropoulos, the Chrysoloras, the famous\r\nChrysococces, deacon of St. Sophia and chief Saccellary.\r\n\r\nBut the fatal hour is at hand, the era of the Crusades is over; an\r\nirresistible ebb has set in; Christendom draws back in its turn. No\r\nlonger is it necessary to go to Jerusalem to battle against the infidel;\r\nhe is found at Nicopolis and Kossovo. The illustrious towns of the\r\nGreek world fall one after the other, and the exiled grammarians seek\r\nshelter with the literate tyrants of Italy, bringing with them their\r\nmanuscripts. Some, like Theodore Gaza, have been driven from\r\nThessalonica, and teach at Mantua and at Sienna; others left after the\r\nfall of Trebizond.\r\n\r\nOn the throne of the Paleologues sits Constantine XII., Dragasses. Brusa\r\nis no longer the capital of the Turks; they have left far behind them\r\nthe town of the green mosques, of the great platanes and tombs of the\r\ncaliphs, they have crossed the Bosphorus and are established at\r\nSalonica, Sophia, Philippopolis. Adrianople is their capital for the\r\ntime being; Mahomet II. commands them. Opposite the \"Castle of Asia,\"\r\nAnatoli Hissar, he has built on the Bosphorus the \"Castle of Europe,\"\r\nRoumel Hissar, with rose-coloured towers; he is master of both shores.\r\n\r\nHe approaches nearer to the town, and draws up his troops under the wall\r\nfacing Europe; he has a hundred and thirty cannon; he opens fire on the\r\n11th of April, 1453. On the 28th of May, the Turks take up their\r\npositions for the onset; whilst in Byzantium a long procession of\r\npriests and monks, carrying the wood of the true cross, miraculous\r\nstatues and relics of saints, wends its way for the last time. The\r\nassault begins at two o'clock in the morning; part of a wall, near the\r\ngate of St. Romanus, falls in; the \"Cercoporta\" gate is taken. The\r\nstruggle goes on in the heart of the town; the emperor is killed; the\r\nbasilica erected by Justinian to Divine Wisdom, St. Sophia, which was in\r\nthe morning filled with a praying multitude, contains now only corpses.\r\nThe smoke of an immense fire rises under the sky.\r\n\r\nAll that could flee exiled themselves; the Greeks flocked to Italy. Out\r\nof the plundered libraries came a number of manuscripts, with which\r\nNicholas V. and Bessarion enriched Rome and Venice. The result of the\r\ndisaster was, for intellectual Europe, a new impulse given to classic\r\nstudies.\r\n\r\nWith the glare of the fire was mingled a light as of dawn; its rays were\r\nto illuminate Italy and France, and, further towards the North, England\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[826] I try, repeatedly says Stephen Hawes,\r\n\r\n    To followe the trace and all the perfitnes\r\n    Of my maister Lydgate.\r\n\r\n\"The Historie of Graund Amoure and La Bell Pucle, called the Pastime of\r\nPlesure, contayning the Knowledge of the Seven Sciences and the Course\r\nof Man's life in this Worlde,\" London, 1554, 4to, curious woodcuts\r\n(reprinted by the Percy Society, 1845, 8vo; the quotation above, p. 2).\r\nIt is an allegory of unendurable dulness, in which Graund Amoure (love\r\nof knowledge apparently) visits Science in the Tower of Doctrine, then\r\nGrammar, &c.

That story figures in the \"Gesta Romanorum,\" in\r\nthe \"Arabian Nights,\" in the collection of Barbazan (story of Constant\r\ndu Hamel).
