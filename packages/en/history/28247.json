A new era\r\nhas dawned, not by chronological prescription alone, but to the vital\r\nsense of humanity. Novel thoughts are rife; fresh impulses stir the\r\nnations; the soughing of the wind of progress strikes every ear. \"The\r\nold order changeth\" more and more swiftly as mental activity becomes\r\nintensified. Already many of the scientific doctrines implicitly\r\naccepted fifteen years ago begin to wear a superannuated aspect.\r\nDalton's atoms are in process of disintegration; Kirchhoff's theorem\r\nvisibly needs to be modified; Clerk Maxwell's medium no longer figures\r\nas an indispensable factotum; \"absolute zero\" is known to be situated on\r\nan asymptote to the curve of cold. Ideas, in short, have all at once\r\nbecome plastic, and none more completely so than those relating to\r\nastronomy. The physics of the heavenly bodies, indeed, finds its best\r\nopportunities in unlooked-for disclosures; for it deals with\r\ntranscendental conditions, and what is strange to terrestrial experience\r\nmay serve admirably to expound what is normal in the skies. In celestial\r\nscience especially, facts that appear subversive are often the most\r\nilluminative, and the prospect of its advance widens and brightens with\r\neach divagation enforced or permitted from the strait paths of rigid\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nThis readiness for innovation has undoubtedly its dangers and drawbacks.\r\nTo the historian, above all, it presents frequent occasions of\r\nembarrassment. The writing of history is a strongly selective operation,\r\nthe outcome being valuable just in so far as the choice what to reject\r\nand what to include has been judicious; and the task is no light one of\r\ndiscriminating between barren speculations and ideas pregnant with\r\ncoming truth. To the possession of such prescience of the future as\r\nwould be needed to do this effectually I can lay no claim; but diligence\r\nand sobriety of thought are ordinarily within reach, and these I shall\r\nhave exercised to good purpose if I have succeeded in rendering the\r\nfourth edition of _A Popular History of Astronomy during the Nineteenth\r\nCentury_ not wholly unworthy of a place in the scientific literature of\r\nthe twentieth century.\r\n\r\nMy thanks are due to Sir David Gill for the use of his photograph of the\r\ngreat comet of 1901, which I have added to my list of illustrations, and\r\nto the Council of the Royal Astronomical Society for the loan of glass\r\npositives needed for the reproduction of those included in the third\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nLondon, _July_, 1902.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION\r\n\r\nThe progress of astronomy during the last hundred years has been rapid\r\nand extraordinary. In its distinctive features, moreover, the nature of\r\nthat progress has been such as to lend itself with facility to\r\nuntechnical treatment. To this circumstance the present volume owes its\r\norigin. It embodies an attempt to enable the ordinary reader to follow,\r\nwith intelligent interest, the course of modern astronomical inquiries,\r\nand to realize (so far as it can at present be realized) the full effect\r\nof the comprehensive change in the whole aspect, purposes, and methods\r\nof celestial science introduced by the momentous discovery of spectrum\r\nanalysis.\r\n\r\nSince Professor Grant's invaluable work on the _History of Physical\r\nAstronomy_ was published, a third of a century has elapsed. During the\r\ninterval a so-called \"new astronomy\" has grown up by the side of the\r\nold. One effect of its advent has been to render the science of the\r\nheavenly bodies more popular, both in its needs and in its nature, than\r\nformerly. More popular in its needs, since its progress now primarily\r\ndepends upon the interest in, and consequent efforts towards its\r\nadvancement of the general public; more popular in its nature, because\r\nthe kind of knowledge it now chiefly tends to accumulate is more easily\r\nintelligible--less remote from ordinary experience--than that evolved by\r\nthe aid of the calculus from materials collected by the use of the\r\ntransit-instrument and chronograph.\r\n\r\nIt has thus become practicable to describe in simple language the most\r\nessential parts of recent astronomical discoveries, and, being\r\npracticable, it could not be otherwise than desirable to do so. The\r\nservice to astronomy itself would be not inconsiderable of enlisting\r\nwider sympathies on its behalf, while to help one single mind towards a\r\nfuller understanding of the manifold works which have in all ages\r\nirresistibly spoken to man of the glory of God might well be an object\r\nof no ignoble ambition.\r\n\r\nThe present volume does not profess to be a complete or exhaustive\r\nhistory of astronomy during the period covered by it. Its design is to\r\npresent a view of the progress of celestial science, on its most\r\ncharacteristic side, since the time of Herschel. Abstruse mathematical\r\ntheories, unless in some of their more striking results, are excluded\r\nfrom consideration. These, during the eighteenth century, constituted\r\nthe sum and substance of astronomy, and their fundamental importance can\r\nnever be diminished, and should never be ignored. But as the outcome of\r\nthe enormous development given to the powers of the telescope in recent\r\ntimes, together with the swift advance of physical science, and the\r\ninclusion, by means of the spectroscope, of the heavenly bodies within\r\nthe domain of its inquiries, much knowledge has been acquired regarding\r\nthe nature and condition of those bodies, forming, it might be said, a\r\nscience apart, and disembarrassed from immediate dependence upon\r\nintricate, and, except to the initiated, unintelligible formulæ. This\r\nkind of knowledge forms the main subject of the book now offered to the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nThere are many reasons for preferring a history to a formal treatise on\r\nastronomy. In a treatise, _what_ we know is set forth. A history tells\r\nus, in addition, _how_ we came to know it. It thus places facts before\r\nus in the natural order of their ascertainment, and narrates instead of\r\nenumerating. The story to be told leaves the marvels of imagination far\r\nbehind, and requires no embellishment from literary art or high-flown\r\nphrases. Its best ornament is unvarnished truthfulness, and this, at\r\nleast, may confidently be claimed to be bestowed upon it in the ensuing\r\npages.\r\n\r\nIn them unity of treatment is sought to be combined with a due regard to\r\nchronological sequence by grouping in separate chapters the various\r\nevents relating to the several departments of descriptive astronomy. The\r\nwhole is divided into two parts, the line between which is roughly drawn\r\nat the middle of the present century. Herschel's inquiries into the\r\nconstruction of the heavens strike the keynote of the first part; the\r\ndiscoveries of sun-spot and magnetic periodicity and of spectrum\r\nanalysis determine the character of the second. Where the nature of the\r\nsubject required it, however, this arrangement has been disregarded.\r\nClearness and consistency should obviously take precedence of method.\r\nThus, in treating of the telescopic scrutiny of the various planets, the\r\nwhole of the related facts have been collected into an uninterrupted\r\nnarrative. A division elsewhere natural and helpful would here have been\r\npurely artificial, and therefore confusing.\r\n\r\nThe interests of students have been consulted by a full and authentic\r\nsystem of references to the sources of information relied upon.\r\nMaterials have been derived, as a rule with very few exceptions, from\r\nthe original authorities. The system adopted has been to take as little\r\nas possible at second-hand. Much pains have been taken to trace the\r\norigin of ideas, often obscurely enunciated long before they came to\r\nresound through the scientific world, and to give to each individual\r\ndiscoverer, strictly and impartially, his due. Prominence has also been\r\nassigned to the biographical element, as underlying and determining the\r\nwhole course of human endeavour. The advance of knowledge may be called\r\na vital process. The lives of men are absorbed into and assimilated by\r\nit. Inquiries into the kind and mode of the surrender in each separate\r\ncase must always possess a strong interest, whether for study or for\r\nexample.\r\n\r\nThe acknowledgments of the writer are due to Professor Edward S. Holden,\r\ndirector of the Washburn Observatory, Wisconsin, and to Dr. Copeland,\r\nchief astronomer of Lord Crawford's Observatory at Dunecht, for many\r\nvaluable communications.\r\n\r\nLondon,

First in order of time came the art of\r\nobserving the returns, and measuring the places, of the heavenly bodies.\r\nThis was the sole astronomy of the Chinese and Chaldeans; but to it the\r\nvigorous Greek mind added a highly complex geometrical plan of their\r\nmovements, for which Copernicus substituted a more harmonious system,\r\nwithout as yet any idea of a compelling cause. The planets revolved in\r\ncircles because it was their nature to do so, just as laudanum sets to\r\nsleep because it possesses a _virtus dormitiva_. This first and oldest\r\nbranch is known as \"observational,\" or \"practical astronomy.\" Its\r\nbusiness is to note facts as accurately as possible; and it is\r\nessentially unconcerned with schemes for connecting those facts in a\r\nmanner satisfactory to the reason.\r\n\r\nThe second kind of astronomy was founded by Newton. Its nature is best\r\nindicated by the term \"gravitational\"; but it is also called\r\n\"theoretical astronomy.\"[1] It is based on the idea of cause; and the\r\nwhole of its elaborate structure is reared according to the dictates of\r\na single law, simple in itself, but the tangled web of whose\r\nconsequences can be unravelled only by the subtle agency of an elaborate\r\ncalculus.\r\n\r\nThe third and last division of celestial science may properly be termed\r\n\"physical and descriptive astronomy.\" It seeks to know what the heavenly\r\nbodies are in themselves, leaving the How? and the Wherefore? of their\r\nmovements to be otherwise answered. Now, such inquiries became possible\r\nonly through the invention of the telescope, so that Galileo was, in\r\npoint of fact, their originator. But Herschel first gave them a\r\nprominence which the whole progress of science during the nineteenth\r\ncentury served to confirm and render more exclusive. Inquisitions begun\r\nwith the telescope have been extended and made effective in unhoped-for\r\ndirections by the aid of the spectroscope and photographic camera; and a\r\nlarge part of our attention in the present volume will be occupied with\r\nthe brilliant results thus achieved.\r\n\r\nThe unexpected development of this new physical-celestial science is the\r\nleading fact in recent astronomical history. It was out of the regular\r\ncourse of events. In the degree in which it has actually occurred it\r\ncould certainly not have been foreseen. It was a seizing of the prize by\r\na competitor who had hardly been thought qualified to enter the lists.\r\nOrthodox astronomers of the old school looked with a certain contempt\r\nupon observers who spent their nights in scrutinising the faces of the\r\nmoon and planets rather than in timing their transits, or devoted\r\ndaylight energies, not to reductions and computations, but to counting\r\nand measuring spots on the sun. They were regarded as irregular\r\npractitioners, to be tolerated perhaps, but certainly not encouraged.\r\n\r\nThe advance of astronomy in the eighteenth century ran in general an\r\neven and logical course. The age succeeding Newton's had for its special\r\ntask to demonstrate the universal validity, and trace the complex\r\nresults, of the law of gravitation. The accomplishment of that task\r\noccupied just one hundred years. It was virtually brought to a close\r\nwhen Laplace explained to the French Academy, November 19, 1787, the\r\ncause of the moon's accelerated motion. As a mere machine, the solar\r\nsystem, so far as it was then known, was found to be complete and\r\nintelligible in all its parts; and in the _Mécanique Céleste_ its\r\nmechanical perfections were displayed under a form of majestic unity\r\nwhich fitly commemorated the successive triumphs of analytical genius\r\nover problems amongst the most arduous ever dealt with by the mind of\r\nman.\r\n\r\nTheory, however, demands a practical test. All its data are derived from\r\nobservation; and their insecurity becomes less tolerable as it advances\r\nnearer to perfection. Observation, on the other hand, is the pitiless\r\ncritic of theory; it detects weak points, and provokes reforms which may\r\nbe the beginnings of discovery. Thus, theory and observation mutually\r\nact and react, each alternately taking the lead in the endless race of\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\nNow, while in France Lagrange and Laplace were bringing the\r\ngravitational theory of the solar system to completion, work of a very\r\ndifferent kind, yet not less indispensable to the future welfare of\r\nastronomy, was being done in England. The Royal Observatory at Greenwich\r\nis one of the few useful institutions which date their origin from the\r\nreign of Charles II. The leading position which it still occupies in the\r\nscience of celestial observation was, for near a century and a half\r\nafter its foundation, an exclusive one. Delambre remarked that, had all\r\nother materials of the kind been destroyed, the Greenwich records alone\r\nwould suffice for the restoration of astronomy. The establishment was\r\nindeed absolutely without a rival.[2] Systematic observations of sun,\r\nmoon, stars, and planets were during the whole of the eighteenth century\r\nmade only at Greenwich. Here materials were accumulated for the secure\r\ncorrection of theory, and here refinements were introduced by which the\r\nexquisite accuracy of modern practice in astronomy was eventually\r\nattained.\r\n\r\nThe chief promoter of these improvements was James Bradley. Few men have\r\npossessed in an equal degree with him the power of seeing accurately,\r\nand reasoning on what they see. He let nothing pass. The slightest\r\ninconsistency between what appeared and what was to be expected roused\r\nhis keenest attention; and he never relaxed his mental grip of a subject\r\nuntil it had yielded to his persistent inquisition. It was to these\r\nqualities that he owed his discoveries of the aberration of light and\r\nthe nutation of the earth's axis. The first was announced in 1729. What\r\nis meant by it is that, owing to the circumstance of light not being\r\ninstantaneously transmitted, the heavenly bodies appear shifted from\r\ntheir true places by an amount depending upon the ratio which the\r\nvelocity of light bears to the speed of the earth in its orbit. Because\r\nlight travels with enormous rapidity, the shifting is very slight; and\r\neach star returns to its original position at the end of a year.\r\n\r\nBradley's second great discovery was finally ascertained in 1748.\r\nNutation is a real \"nodding\" of the terrestrial axis produced by the\r\ndragging of the moon at the terrestrial equatorial protuberance. From it\r\nresults an _apparent_ displacement of the stars, each of them describing\r\na little ellipse about its true or \"mean\" position, in a period of\r\nnearly nineteen years.\r\n\r\nNow, an acquaintance with the fact and the laws of each of these minute\r\nirregularities is vital to the progress of observational astronomy; for\r\nwithout it the places of the heavenly bodies could never be accurately\r\nknown or compared. So that Bradley, by their detection, at once raised\r\nthe science to a higher grade of precision. Nor was this the whole of\r\nhis work. Appointed Astronomer-Royal in 1742, he executed during the\r\nyears 1750-62 a series of observations which formed the real beginning\r\nof exact astronomy. Part of their superiority must, indeed, be\r\nattributed to the co-operation of John Bird, who provided Bradley in\r\n1750 with a measuring instrument of till then unequalled excellence. For\r\nnot only was the art of observing in the eighteenth century a peculiarly\r\nEnglish art, but the means of observing were furnished almost\r\nexclusively by British artists. John Dollond, the son of a Spitalfields\r\nweaver, invented the achromatic lens in 1758, removing thereby the chief\r\nobstacle to the development of the powers of refracting telescopes;\r\nJames Short, of Edinburgh, was without a rival in the construction of\r\nreflectors; the sectors, quadrants, and circles of Graham, Bird,\r\nRamsden, and Cary were inimitable by Continental workmanship.\r\n\r\nThus practical and theoretical astronomy advanced on parallel lines in\r\nEngland and France respectively, the improvement of their several\r\ntools--the telescope and the quadrant on the one side, and the calculus\r\non the other--keeping pace. The whole future of the science seemed to be\r\ntheirs. The cessation of interest through a too speedy attainment of the\r\nperfection towards which each spurred the other, appeared to be the only\r\ndanger it held in store for them. When all at once, a rival stood by\r\ntheir side--not, indeed, menacing their progress, but threatening to\r\nabsorb their popularity.\r\n\r\nThe rise of Herschel was the one conspicuous anomaly in the astronomical\r\nhistory of the eighteenth century. It proved decisive of the course of\r\nevents in the nineteenth. It was unexplained by anything that had gone\r\nbefore; yet all that came after hinged upon it. It gave a new direction\r\nto effort; it lent a fresh impulse to thought. It opened a channel for\r\nthe widespread public interest which was gathering towards astronomical\r\nsubjects to flow in.\r\n\r\nMuch of this interest was due to the occurrence of events calculated to\r\narrest the attention and excite the wonder of the uninitiated. The\r\npredicted return of Halley's comet in 1759 verified, after an\r\nunprecedented fashion, the computations of astronomers. It deprived such\r\nbodies for ever of their portentous character; it ranked them as\r\ndenizens of the solar system. Again, the transits of Venus in 1761 and\r\n1769 were the first occurrences of the kind since the awakening of\r\nscience to their consequence. Imposing preparations, journeys to remote\r\nand hardly accessible regions, official expeditions, international\r\ncommunications, all for the purpose of observing them to the best\r\nadvantage, brought their high significance vividly to the public\r\nconsciousness; a result aided by the facile pen of Lalande, in rendering\r\nintelligible the means by which these elaborate arrangements were to\r\nissue in an accurate knowledge of the sun's distance. Lastly, Herschel's\r\ndiscovery of Uranus, March 13, 1781, had the surprising effect of utter\r\nnovelty. Since the human race had become acquainted with the company of\r\nthe planets, no addition had been made to their number. The event thus\r\nbroke with immemorial traditions, and seemed to show astronomy as still\r\nyoung and full of unlooked-for possibilities.\r\n\r\nFurther popularity accrued to the science from the sequel of a career so\r\nstrikingly opened. Herschel's huge telescopes, his detection by their\r\nmeans of two Saturnian and as many Uranian moons, his piercing scrutiny\r\nof the sun, picturesque theory of its constitution, and sagacious\r\nindication of the route pursued by it through space; his discovery of\r\nstellar revolving systems, his bold soundings of the universe, his\r\ngrandiose ideas, and the elevated yet simple language in which they were\r\nconveyed--formed a combination powerfully effective to those least\r\nsusceptible of new impressions. Nor was the evoked enthusiasm limited to\r\nthe British Isles. In Germany, Schröter followed--_longo intervallo_--in\r\nHerschel's track. Von Zach set on foot from Gotha that general\r\ncommunication of ideas which gives life to a forward movement. Bode\r\nwrote much and well for unlearned readers. Lalande, by his popular\r\nlectures and treatises, helped to form an audience which Laplace himself\r\ndid not disdain to address in the _Exposition du Système du Monde_.\r\n\r\nThis great accession of public interest gave the impulse to the\r\nextraordinarily rapid progress of astronomy in the nineteenth century.\r\nOfficial patronage combined with individual zeal sufficed for the elder\r\nbranches of the science. A few well-endowed institutions could\r\naccumulate the materials needed by a few isolated thinkers for the\r\nconstruction of theories of wonderful beauty and elaboration, yet\r\nprecluded, by their abstract nature, from winning general applause. But\r\nthe new physical astronomy depends for its prosperity upon the favour of\r\nthe multitude whom its striking results are well fitted to attract. It\r\nis, in a special manner, the science of amateurs. It welcomes the most\r\nunpretending co-operation. There is no one \"with a true eye and a\r\nfaithful hand\" but can do good work in watching the heavens. And not\r\nunfrequently, prizes of discovery which the most perfect appliances\r\nfailed to grasp, have fallen to the share of ignorant or ill-provided\r\nassiduity.\r\n\r\nObservers, accordingly, have multiplied; observatories have been founded\r\nin all parts of the world; associations have been constituted for mutual\r\nhelp and counsel. A formal astronomical congress met in 1789 at\r\nGotha--then, under Duke Ernest II. and Von Zach, the focus of German\r\nastronomy--and instituted a combined search for the planet suspected to\r\nrevolve undiscovered between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. The\r\nAstronomical Society of London was established in 1820, and the similar\r\nGerman institution in 1863. Both have been highly influential in\r\npromoting the interests, local and general, of the science they are\r\ndevoted to forward; while functions corresponding to theirs have been\r\ndischarged elsewhere by older or less specially constituted bodies, and\r\nnew ones of a more popular character are springing up on all sides.\r\n\r\nModern facilities of communication have helped to impress more deeply\r\nupon modern astronomy its associative character. The electric telegraph\r\ngives a certain ubiquity which is invaluable to an observer of the\r\nskies. With the help of a wire, a battery, and a code of signals, he\r\nsees whatever is visible from any portion of our globe, depending,\r\nhowever, upon other eyes than his own, and so entering as a unit into a\r\nwidespread organisation of intelligence. The press, again, has been a\r\npotent agent of co-operation. It has mainly contributed to unite\r\nastronomers all over the world into a body animated by the single aim of\r\ncollecting \"particulars\" in their special branch for what Bacon termed a\r\nHistory of Nature, eventually to be interpreted according to the\r\nsagacious insight of some one among them gifted above his fellows. The\r\nfirst really effective astronomical periodical was the _Monatliche\r\nCorrespondenz_, started by Von Zach in the year 1800. It was followed in\r\n1822 by the _Astronomische Nachrichten_, later by the _Memoirs_ and\r\n_Monthly Notices_ of the Astronomical Society, and by the host of varied\r\npublications which now, in every civilised country, communicate the\r\ndiscoveries made in astronomy to divers classes of readers, and so\r\nincalculably quicken the current of its onward flow.\r\n\r\nPublic favour brings in its train material resources. It is represented\r\nby individual enterprise, and finds expression in an ample liberality.\r\nThe first regular observatory in the Southern Hemisphere was founded at\r\nParamatta by Sir Thomas Makdougall Brisbane in 1821. The Royal\r\nObservatory at the Cape of Good Hope was completed in 1829. Similar\r\nestablishments were set to work by the East India Company at Madras,\r\nBombay, and St. Helena, during the first third of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. The organisation of astronomy in the United States of America\r\nwas due to a strong wave of popular enthusiasm. In 1825 John Quincy\r\nAdams vainly urged upon Congress the foundation of a National\r\nObservatory; but in 1843 the lectures on celestial phenomena of Ormsby\r\nMacKnight Mitchel stirred an impressionable audience to the pitch of\r\nproviding him with the means of erecting at Cincinnati the first\r\nastronomical establishment worthy the name in that great country. On the\r\n1st of January, 1882, no less than one hundred and forty-four were\r\nactive within its boundaries.\r\n\r\nThe apparition of the great comet of 1843 gave an additional fillip to\r\nthe movement. To the excitement caused by it the Harvard College\r\nObservatory--called the \"American Pulkowa\"--directly owed its origin;\r\nand the example was not ineffective elsewhere. The United States Naval\r\nObservatory was built in 1844, Lieutenant Maury being its first\r\nDirector. Corporations, universities, municipalities, vied with each\r\nother in the creation of such institutions; private subscriptions poured\r\nin; emissaries were sent to Europe to purchase instruments and to\r\nprocure instruction in their use. In a few years the young Republic was,\r\nin point of astronomical efficiency, at least on a level with countries\r\nwhere the science had been fostered since the dawn of civilisation.\r\n\r\nA vast widening of the scope of astronomy has accompanied, and in part\r\noccasioned, the great extension of its area of cultivation which our age\r\nhas witnessed. In the last century its purview was a comparatively\r\nnarrow one. Problems lying beyond the range of the solar system were\r\nalmost unheeded, because they seemed inscrutable. Herschel first showed\r\nthe sidereal universe as accessible to investigation, and thereby\r\noffered to science new worlds--majestic, manifold, \"infinitely infinite\"\r\nto our apprehension in number, variety, and extent--for future conquest.\r\nTheir gradual appropriation has absorbed, and will long continue to\r\nabsorb, the powers which it has served to develop.\r\n\r\nBut this is not the only direction in which astronomy has enlarged, or\r\nrather has levelled, its boundaries. The unification of the physical\r\nsciences is perhaps the greatest intellectual feat of recent times. The\r\nprocess has included astronomy; so that, like Bacon, she may now be said\r\nto have \"taken all knowledge\" (of that kind) \"for her province.\" In\r\nreturn, she proffers potent aid for its increase. Every comet that\r\napproaches the sun is the scene of experiments in the electrical\r\nillumination of rarefied matter, performed on a huge scale for our\r\nbenefit. The sun, stars, and nebulæ form so many celestial laboratories,\r\nwhere the nature and mutual relations of the chemical \"elements\" may be\r\ntried by more stringent tests than sublunary conditions afford. The laws\r\nof terrestrial magnetism can be completely investigated only with the\r\naid of a concurrent study of the face of the sun. The solar spectrum\r\nwill perhaps one day, by its recurrent modifications, tell us something\r\nof impending droughts, famines, and cyclones.\r\n\r\nAstronomy generalises the results of the other sciences. She exhibits\r\nthe laws of Nature working over a wider area, and under more varied\r\nconditions, than ordinary experience presents. Ordinary experience, on\r\nthe other hand, has become indispensable to her progress. She takes in\r\nat one view the indefinitely great and the indefinitely little. The\r\nmutual revolutions of the stellar multitude during tracts of time which\r\nseem to lengthen out to eternity as the mind attempts to traverse them,\r\nshe does not admit to be beyond her ken; nor is she indifferent to the\r\nconstitution of the minutest atom of matter that thrills the ether into\r\nlight. How she entered upon this vastly expanded inheritance, and how,\r\nso far, she has dealt with it, is attempted to be set forth in the\r\nensuing chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The denomination \"physical astronomy,\" first used by\r\nKepler, and long appropriated to this branch of the science, has of late\r\nbeen otherwise applied.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Histoire de l'Astronomie au xviii^e Siècle_, p. 267.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 PART I\r\n\r\nPROGRESS OF ASTRONOMY DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n                   _FOUNDATION OF SIDEREAL ASTRONOMY_\r\n\r\n\r\nUntil nearly a hundred years ago the stars were regarded by practical\r\nastronomers mainly as a number of convenient fixed points by which the\r\nmotions of the various members of the solar system could be determined\r\nand compared. Their recognised function, in fact, was that of milestones\r\non the great celestial highway traversed by the planets, as well as on\r\nthe byways of space occasionally pursued by comets. Not that curiosity\r\nas to their nature, and even conjecture as to their origin, were at any\r\nperiod absent. Both were from time to time powerfully stimulated by the\r\nappearance of startling novelties in a region described by philosophers\r\nas \"incorruptible,\" or exempt from change. The catalogue of Hipparchus\r\nprobably, and certainly that of Tycho Brahe, some seventeen centuries\r\nlater, owed each its origin to the temporary blaze of a new star. The\r\ngeneral aspect of the skies was thus (however imperfectly) recorded from\r\nage to age, and with improved appliances the enumeration was rendered\r\nmore and more accurate and complete; but the secrets of the stellar\r\nsphere remained inviolate.\r\n\r\nIn a qualified though very real sense, Sir William Herschel may be\r\ncalled the Founder of Sidereal Astronomy. Before his time some curious\r\nfacts had been noted, and some ingenious speculations hazarded,\r\nregarding the condition of the stars, but not even the rudiments of\r\nsystematic knowledge had been acquired. The facts ascertained can be\r\nsummed up in a very few sentences.\r\n\r\nGiordano Bruno was the first to set the suns of space in motion; but in\r\nimagination only. His daring surmise was, however, confirmed in 1718,\r\nwhen Halley announced[3] that Sirius, Aldebaran, Betelgeux, and Arcturus\r\nhad unmistakably shifted their quarters in the sky since Ptolemy\r\nassigned their places in his catalogue. A similar conclusion was reached\r\nby J. Cassini in 1738, from a comparison of his own observations with\r\nthose made at Cayenne by Richer in 1672; and Tobias Mayer drew up in\r\n1756 a list showing the direction and amount of about fifty-seven proper\r\nmotions,[4] founded on star-places determined by Olaus Römer fifty years\r\npreviously. Thus the stars were no longer regarded as \"fixed,\" but the\r\nquestion remained whether the movements perceived were real or only\r\napparent; and this it was not yet found possible to answer. Already, in\r\nthe previous century, the ingenious Robert Hooke had suggested an\r\n\"alteration of the very system of the sun,\"[5] to account for certain\r\nsuspected changes in stellar positions; Bradley in 1748, and Lambert in\r\n1761, pointed out that such apparent displacements (by that time well\r\nascertained) were in all probability a combined effect of motions both\r\nof sun and stars; and Mayer actually attempted the analysis, but without\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of August, 1596, David Fabricius, an unprofessional\r\nastronomer in East Friesland, saw in the neck of the Whale a star of the\r\nthird magnitude, which by October had disappeared. It was, nevertheless,\r\nvisible in 1603, when Bayer marked it in his catalogue with the Greek\r\nletter Omicron, and was watched, in 1638-39, through its phases of\r\nbrightening and apparent extinction by a Dutch professor named\r\nHolwarda.[6] From Hevelius this first-known periodical star received the\r\nname of \"Mira,\" or the Wonderful, and Boulliaud in 1667 fixed the length\r\nof its cycle of change at 334 days. It was not a solitary instance. A\r\nstar in the Swan was perceived by Janson in 1600 to show fluctuations of\r\nlight, and Montanari found in 1669 that Algol in Perseus shared the same\r\npeculiarity to a marked degree. Altogether the class embraced in 1782\r\nhalf-a-dozen members. When it is added that a few star-couples had been\r\nnoted in singularly, but it was supposed accidentally, close\r\njuxtaposition, and that the failure of repeated attempts to measure\r\nstellar parallaxes pointed to distances _at least_ 400,000 times that of\r\nthe earth from the sun,[7] the picture of sidereal science, when the\r\nlast quarter of the eighteenth century began, is practically complete.\r\nIt included three items of information: that the stars have motions,\r\nreal or apparent; that they are immeasurably remote; and that a few\r\nshine with a periodically variable light. Nor were these scantily\r\ncollected facts ordered into any promise of further development. They\r\nlay at once isolated and confused before the inquirer. They needed to be\r\nboth multiplied and marshalled, and it seemed as if centuries of patient\r\ntoil must elapse before any reliable conclusions could be derived from\r\nthem. The sidereal world was thus the recognised domain of far-reaching\r\nspeculations, which remained wholly uncramped by systematic research\r\nuntil Herschel entered upon his career as an observer of the heavens.\r\n\r\nThe greatest of modern astronomers was born at Hanover, November 15,\r\n1738. He was the fourth child of Isaac Herschel, a hautboy-player in the\r\nband of the Hanoverian Guard, and was early trained to follow his\r\nfather's profession. On the termination, however, of the disastrous\r\ncampaign of 1757, his parents removed him from the regiment, there is\r\nreason to believe, in a somewhat unceremonious manner. Technically,\r\nindeed, he incurred the penalties of desertion, remitted--according to\r\nthe Duke of Sussex's statement to Sir George Airy--by a formal pardon\r\nhanded to him personally by George III. on his presentation in 1782.[8]\r\nAt the age of nineteen, then, his military service having lasted four\r\nyears, he came to England to seek his fortune. Of the life of struggle\r\nand privation which ensued little is known beyond the circumstances that\r\nin 1760 he was engaged in training the regimental band of the Durham\r\nMilitia, and that in 1765 he was appointed organist at Halifax. In the\r\nfollowing year he removed to Bath as oboist in Linley's orchestra, and\r\nin October 1767 was promoted to the post of organist in the Octagon\r\nChapel. The tide of prosperity now began to flow for him. The most\r\nbrilliant and modish society in England was at that time to be met at\r\nBath, and the young Hanoverian quickly found himself a favourite and the\r\nfashion in it. Engagements multiplied upon him. He became director of\r\nthe public concerts; he conducted oratorios, engaged singers, organised\r\nrehearsals, composed anthems, chants, choral services, besides\r\nundertaking private tuitions, at times amounting to thirty-five or even\r\nthirty-eight lessons a week. He in fact personified the musical activity\r\nof a place then eminently and energetically musical.\r\n\r\nBut these multifarious avocations did not take up the whole of his\r\nthoughts. His education, notwithstanding the poverty of his family, had\r\nnot been neglected, and he had always greedily assimilated every kind of\r\nknowledge that came in his way. Now that he was a busy and a prosperous\r\nman, it might have been expected that he would run on in the deep\r\nprofessional groove laid down for him. On the contrary, his passion for\r\nlearning seemed to increase with the diminution of the time available\r\nfor its gratification. He studied Italian, Greek, mathematics;\r\nMaclaurin's Fluxions served to \"unbend his mind\"; Smith's Harmonics and\r\nOptics and Ferguson's Astronomy were the nightly companions of his\r\npillow. What he read stimulated without satisfying his intellect. He\r\ndesired not only to know, but to discover. In 1772 he hired a small\r\ntelescope, and through it caught a preliminary glimpse of the rich and\r\nvaried fields in which for so many years he was to expatiate.\r\nHenceforward the purpose of his life was fixed: it was to obtain \"a\r\nknowledge of the construction of the heavens\";[9] and this sublime\r\nambition he cherished to the end.\r\n\r\nA more powerful instrument was the first desideratum; and here his\r\nmechanical genius came to his aid. Having purchased the apparatus of a\r\nQuaker optician, he set about the manufacture of specula with a zeal\r\nwhich seemed to anticipate the wonders they were to disclose to him. It\r\nwas not until fifteen years later that his grinding and polishing\r\nmachines were invented, so the work had at that time to be entirely done\r\nby hand. During this tedious and laborious process (which could not be\r\ninterrupted without injury, and lasted on one occasion sixteen hours),\r\nhis strength was supported by morsels of food put into his mouth by his\r\nsister,[10] and his mind amused by her reading aloud to him the Arabian\r\nNights, Don Quixote, or other light works. At length, after repeated\r\nfailures, he found himself provided with a reflecting telescope--a\r\n5-1/2-foot Gregorian--of his own construction. A copy of his first\r\nobservation with it, on the great Nebula in Orion--an object of\r\ncontinual amazement and assiduous inquiry to him--is preserved by the\r\nRoyal Society. It bears the date March 4, 1774.[11]\r\n\r\nIn the following year he executed his first \"review of the heavens,\"\r\nmemorable chiefly as an evidence of the grand and novel conceptions\r\nwhich already inspired him, and of the enthusiasm with which he\r\ndelivered himself up to their guidance. Overwhelmed with professional\r\nengagements, he still contrived to snatch some moments for the stars;\r\nand between the acts at the theatre was often seen running from the\r\nharpsichord to his telescope, no doubt with that \"uncommon precipitancy\r\nwhich accompanied all his actions.\"[12] He now rapidly increased the\r\npower and perfection of his telescopes. Mirrors of seven, ten, even\r\ntwenty feet focal length, were successively completed, and unprecedented\r\nmagnifying powers employed. His energy was unceasing, his perseverance\r\nindomitable. In the course of twenty-one years no less than 430\r\nparabolic specula left his hands. He had entered upon his forty-second\r\nyear when he sent his first paper to the _Philosophical Transactions_;\r\nyet during the ensuing thirty-nine years his contributions--many of them\r\nelaborate treatises--numbered sixty-nine, forming a series of\r\nextraordinary importance to the history of astronomy. As a mere explorer\r\nof the heavens his labours were prodigious. He discovered 2,500 nebulæ,\r\n806 double stars, passed the whole firmament in review four several\r\ntimes, counted the stars in 3,400 \"gauge-fields,\" and executed a\r\nphotometric classification of the principal stars, founded on an\r\nelaborate (and the first systematically conducted) investigation of\r\ntheir relative brightness. He was as careful and patient as he was\r\nrapid; spared no time and omitted no precaution to secure accuracy in\r\nhis observations; yet in one night he would examine, singly and\r\nattentively, up to 400 separate objects.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of Uranus was a mere incident of the scheme he had marked\r\nout for himself--a fruit, gathered as it were by the way. It formed,\r\nnevertheless, the turning-point in his career. From a star-gazing\r\nmusician he was at once transformed into an eminent astronomer; he was\r\nrelieved from the drudgery of a toilsome profession, and installed as\r\nRoyal Astronomer, with a modest salary of £200 a year; funds were\r\nprovided for the construction of the forty-foot reflector, from the\r\ngreat space-penetrating power of which he expected unheard-of\r\nrevelations; in fine, his future work was not only rendered possible,\r\nbut it was stamped as authoritative.[13] On Whit-Sunday 1782, William\r\nand Caroline Herschel played and sang in public for the last time in St.\r\nMargaret's Chapel, Bath; in August of the same year the household was\r\nmoved to Datchet, near Windsor, and on April 3, 1786, to Slough. Here\r\nhappiness and honours crowded on the fortunate discoverer. In 1788 he\r\nmarried Mary, only child of James Baldwin, a merchant of the city of\r\nLondon, and widow of Mr. John Pitt--a lady whose domestic virtues were\r\nenhanced by the possession of a large jointure. The fruit of their union\r\nwas one son, of whose work--the worthy sequel of his father's--we shall\r\nhave to speak further on. Herschel was created a Knight of the\r\nHanoverian Guelphic Order in 1816, and in 1821 he became the first\r\nPresident of the Royal Astronomical Society, his son being its first\r\nForeign Secretary. But his health had now for some years been failing,\r\nand on August 25, 1822, he died at Slough, in the eighty-fourth year of\r\nhis age, and was buried in Upton churchyard.\r\n\r\nHis epitaph claims for him the lofty praise of having \"burst the\r\nbarriers of heaven.\" Let us see in what sense this is true.\r\n\r\nThe first to form any definite idea as to the constitution of the\r\nstellar system was Thomas Wright, the son of a carpenter living at\r\nByer's Green, near Durham. With him originated what has been called the\r\n\"Grindstone Theory\" of the universe, which regarded the Milky Way as the\r\nprojection on the sphere of a stratum or disc of stars (our sun\r\noccupying a position near the centre), similar in magnitude and\r\ndistribution to the lucid orbs of the constellations.[14] He was\r\nfollowed by Kant,[15] who transcended the views of his predecessor by\r\nassigning to nebulæ the position they long continued to occupy, rather\r\non imaginative than scientific grounds, of \"island universes,\" external\r\nto, and co-equal with, the Galaxy. Johann Heinrich Lambert,[16] a\r\ntailor's apprentice from Mühlhausen, followed, but independently. The\r\nconceptions of this remarkable man were grandiose, his intuitions bold,\r\nhis views on some points a singular anticipation of subsequent\r\ndiscoveries. The sidereal world presented itself to him as a hierarchy\r\nof systems, starting from the planetary scheme, rising to throngs of\r\nsuns within the circuit of the Milky Way--the \"ecliptic of the stars,\"\r\nas he phrased it--expanding to include groups of many Milky Ways; these\r\nagain combining to form the unit of a higher order of assemblage, and so\r\nonwards and upwards until the mind reels and sinks before the immensity\r\nof the contemplated creations.\r\n\r\n\"Thus everything revolves--the earth round the sun; the sun round the\r\ncentre of his system; this system round a centre common to it with other\r\nsystems; this group, this assemblage of systems, round a centre which is\r\ncommon to it with other groups of the same kind; and where shall we have\r\ndone?\"[17]\r\n\r\nThe stupendous problem thus speculatively attempted, Herschel undertook\r\nto grapple with experimentally. The upshot of this memorable inquiry was\r\nthe inclusion, for the first time, within the sphere of human knowledge,\r\nof a connected body of facts, and inferences from facts, regarding the\r\nsidereal universe; in other words, the foundation of what may properly\r\nbe called a science of the stars.\r\n\r\nTobias Mayer had illustrated the perspective effects which must ensue in\r\nthe stellar sphere from a translation of the solar system, by comparing\r\nthem to the separating in front and closing up behind of trees in a\r\nforest to the eye of an advancing spectator;[18] but the appearances\r\nwhich he thus correctly described he was unable to detect. By a more\r\nsearching analysis of a smaller collection of proper motions, Herschel\r\nsucceeded in rendering apparent the very consequences foreseen by Mayer.\r\nHe showed, for example, that Arcturus and Vega did, in fact, appear to\r\nrecede from, and Sirius and Aldebaran to approach, each other by very\r\nminute amounts; and, with a striking effort of divinatory genius, placed\r\nthe \"apex,\" or point of direction of the sun's motion, close to the star\r\nLambda in the constellation Hercules,[19] within a few degrees of\r\nthe spot indicated by later and indefinitely more refined methods of\r\nresearch. He resumed the subject in 1805,[20] but though employing a\r\nmore rigorous method, was scarcely so happy in his result. In 1806,[21]\r\nhe made a preliminary attempt to ascertain the speed of the sun's\r\njourney, fixing it, by doubtless much too low an estimate, at about\r\nthree miles a second. Yet the validity of his general conclusion as to\r\nthe line of solar travel, though long doubted, has been triumphantly\r\nconfirmed. The question as to the \"secular parallax\" of the fixed stars\r\nwas in effect answered.\r\n\r\nWith their _annual_ parallax, however, the case was very different. The\r\nsearch for it had already led Bradley to the important discoveries of\r\nthe aberration of light and the nutation of the earth's axis; it was now\r\nabout to lead Herschel to a discovery of a different, but even more\r\nelevated character. Yet in neither case was the object primarily sought\r\nattained.\r\n\r\nFrom the very first promulgation of the Copernician theory the seeming\r\nimmobility of the stars had been urged as an argument against its truth;\r\nfor if the earth really travelled in a vast orbit round the sun, objects\r\nin surrounding space should appear to change their positions, unless\r\ntheir distances were on a scale which, to the narrow ideas of the\r\nuniverse then prevailing, seemed altogether extravagant.[22] The\r\nexistence of such apparent or \"parallactic\" displacements was\r\naccordingly regarded as the touchstone of the new views, and their\r\ndetection became an object of earnest desire to those interested in\r\nmaintaining them. Copernicus himself made the attempt; but with his\r\n\"Triquetrum,\" a jointed wooden rule with the divisions marked in ink,\r\nconstructed by himself,[23] he was hardly able to measure angles of ten\r\nminutes, far less fractions of a second. Galileo, a more impassioned\r\ndefender of the system, strained his ears, as it were, from Arcetri, in\r\nhis blind and sorrowful old age, for news of a discovery which two more\r\ncenturies had still to wait for. Hooke believed he had found a parallax\r\nfor the bright star in the Head of the Dragon; but was deceived. Bradley\r\nconvinced himself that such effects were too minute for his instruments\r\nto measure. Herschel made a fresh attempt by a practically untried\r\nmethod.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of daily experience that two objects situated at\r\ndifferent distances seem to a beholder in motion to move relatively to\r\neach other. This principle Galileo, in the third of his Dialogues on the\r\nSystems of the World,[24] proposed to employ for the determination of\r\nstellar parallax; for two stars, lying apparently close together, but in\r\nreality separated by a great gulf of space, must shift their mutual\r\npositions when observed from opposite points of the earth's orbit; or\r\nrather, the remoter forms a virtually fixed point, to which the\r\nmovements of the other can be conveniently referred. By this means\r\ncomplications were abolished more numerous and perplexing than Galileo\r\nhimself was aware of, and the problem was reduced to one of simple\r\nmicrometrical measurement. The \"double-star method\" was also suggested\r\nby James Gregory in 1675, and again by Wallis in 1693;[25] Huygens\r\nfirst, and afterwards Dr. Long of Cambridge (about 1750), made futile\r\nexperiments with it; and it eventually led, in the hands of Bessel, to\r\nthe successful determination of the parallax of 61 Cygni.\r\n\r\nIts advantages were not lost upon Herschel. His attempt to assign\r\ndefinite distances to the nearest stars was no isolated effort, but part\r\nof the settled plan upon which his observations were conducted. He\r\nproposed to sound the heavens, and the first requisite was a knowledge\r\nof the length of his sounding-line. Thus it came about that his special\r\nattention was early directed to double stars.\r\n\r\n\"I resolved,\" he writes,[26] \"to examine every star in the heavens with\r\nthe utmost attention and a very high power, that I might collect such\r\nmaterials for this research as would enable me to fix my observations\r\nupon those that would best answer my end. The subject has already proved\r\nso extensive, and still promises so rich a harvest to those who are\r\ninclined to be diligent in the pursuit, that I cannot help inviting\r\nevery lover of astronomy to join with me in observations that must\r\ninevitably lead to new discoveries.\"\r\n\r\nThe first result of these inquiries was a classed catalogue of 269\r\ndouble stars presented to the Royal Society in 1782, followed, after\r\nthree years, by an additional list of 434. In both these collections the\r\ndistances separating the individuals of each pair were carefully\r\nmeasured, and (with a few exceptions) the angles made with the\r\nhour-circle by the lines joining their centres (technically called\r\n\"angles of position\") were determined with the aid of a \"revolving-wire\r\nmicrometer,\" specially devised for the purpose. Moreover, an important\r\nnovelty was introduced by the observation of the various colours visible\r\nin the star-couples, the singular and vivid contrasts of which were now\r\nfor the first time described.\r\n\r\nDouble stars were at that time supposed to be a purely optical\r\nphenomenon. Their components, it was thought, while in reality\r\nindefinitely remote from each other, were brought into fortuitous\r\ncontiguity by the chance of lying nearly in the same line of sight from\r\nthe earth. Yet Bradley had noticed a change of 30°, between 1718 and\r\n1759, in the position-angle of the two stars forming Castor, and was\r\nthus within a hair's breadth of the discovery of their physical\r\nconnection.[27] While the Rev. John Michell, arguing by the doctrine of\r\nprobabilities, wrote as follows in 1767:--\"It is highly probable in\r\nparticular, and next to a certainty in general, that such double stars\r\nas appear to consist of two or more stars placed very near together, do\r\nreally consist of stars placed near together, and under the influence of\r\nsome general law.\"[28] And in 1784:[29] \"It is not improbable that a few\r\nyears may inform us that some of the great number of double, triple\r\nstars, etc., which have been observed by Mr. Herschel, are systems of\r\nbodies revolving about each other.\"\r\n\r\nThis remarkable speculative anticipation had a practical counterpart in\r\nGermany. Father Christian Mayer, a Jesuit astronomer at Mannheim, set\r\nhimself, in January 1776, to collect examples of stellar pairs, and\r\nshortly after published the supposed discovery of \"satellites\" to many\r\nof the principal stars.[30] But his observations were neither exact nor\r\nprolonged enough to lead to useful results in such an inquiry. His\r\ndisclosures were derided; his planet-stars treated as results of\r\nhallucination. _On n'a point cru à des choses aussi extraordinaires_,\r\nwrote Lalande[31] within one year of a better-grounded announcement to\r\nthe same effect.\r\n\r\nHerschel at first shared the general opinion as to the merely optical\r\nconnection of double stars. Of this the purpose for which he made his\r\ncollection is in itself sufficient evidence, since what may be called\r\nthe _differential_ method of parallaxes depends, as we have seen, for\r\nits efficacy upon disparity of distance. It was \"much too soon,\" he\r\ndeclared in 1782,[32] \"to form any theories of small stars revolving\r\nround large ones;\" while in the year following,[33] he remarked that the\r\nidentical proper motions of the two stars forming, to the naked eye, the\r\nsingle bright orb of Castor could only be explained as both equally due\r\nto the \"systematic parallax\" caused by the sun's movement in space.\r\nPlainly showing that the notion of a physical tie, compelling the two\r\nbodies to travel together, had not as yet entered into his speculations.\r\nBut he was eminently open to conviction, and had, moreover, by\r\nobservations unparalleled in amount as well as in kind, prepared ample\r\nmaterials for convincing himself and others. In 1802 he was able to\r\nannounce the fact of his discovery, and in the two ensuing years, to lay\r\nin detail before the Royal Society proofs, gathered from the labours of\r\na quarter of a century, of orbital revolution in the case of as many as\r\nfifty double stars, henceforth, he declared, to be held as real binary\r\ncombinations, \"intimately held together by the bond of mutual\r\nattraction.\"[34] The fortunate preservation in Dr. Maskelyne's note-book\r\nof a remark made by Bradley about 1759, to the effect that the line\r\njoining the components of Castor was an exact prolongation of that\r\njoining Castor with Pollux, added eighteen years to the time during\r\nwhich the pair were under scrutiny, and confirmed the evidence of change\r\nafforded by more recent observations. Approximate periods were fixed for\r\nmany of the revolving suns--for Castor 342 years; for Gamma Leonis,\r\n1200, Delta Serpentis, 375, Eta Bootis, 1681 years; Eta Lyræ\r\nwas noted as a \"double-double-star,\" a change of relative\r\nsituation having been detected in each of the two pairs composing the\r\ngroup; and the occultation was described of one star by another in the\r\ncourse of their mutual revolutions, as exemplified in 1795 by the\r\nrapidly circulating system of Zeta Herculis.\r\n\r\nThus, by the sagacity and perseverance of a single observer, a firm\r\nbasis was at last provided upon which to raise the edifice of sidereal\r\nscience. The analogy long presumed to exist between the mighty star of\r\nour system and the bright points of light spangling the firmament was\r\nshown to be no fiction of the imagination, but a physical reality; the\r\nfundamental quality of attractive power was proved to be common to\r\nmatter so far as the telescope was capable of exploring, and law,\r\nsubordination, and regularity to give testimony of supreme and\r\nintelligent design no less in those limitless regions of space than in\r\nour narrow terrestrial home. The discovery was emphatically (in Arago's\r\nphrase) \"one with a future,\" since it introduced the element of precise\r\nknowledge where more or less probable conjecture had previously held\r\nalmost undivided sway; and precise knowledge tends to propagate itself\r\nand advance from point to point.\r\n\r\nWe have now to speak of Herschel's pioneering work in the skies. To\r\nexplore with line and plummet the shining zone of the Milky Way, to\r\ndelineate its form, measure its dimensions, and search out the\r\nintricacies of its construction, was the primary task of his life, which\r\nhe never lost sight of, and to which all his other investigations were\r\nsubordinate. He was absolutely alone in this bold endeavour. Unaided, he\r\nhad to devise methods, accumulate materials, and sift out results. Yet\r\nit may safely be asserted that all the knowledge we possess on this\r\nsublime subject was prepared, and the greater part of it anticipated, by\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe ingenious method of \"star-gauging,\" and its issue in the delineation\r\nof the sidereal system as an irregular stratum of evenly-scattered suns,\r\nis the best-known part of his work. But it was, in truth, only a first\r\nrude approximation, the principle of which maintained its credit in the\r\nliterature of astronomy a full half-century after its abandonment by its\r\nauthor. This principle was the general equality of star distribution. If\r\nequal portions of space really held equal numbers of stars, it is\r\nobvious that the number of stars visible in any particular direction\r\nwould be strictly proportional to the range of the system in that\r\ndirection, apparent accumulation being produced by real extent. The\r\nprocess of \"gauging the heavens,\" accordingly, consisted in counting the\r\nstars in successive telescopic fields, and calculating thence the depths\r\nof space necessary to contain them. The result of 3,400 such operations\r\nwas the plan of the Galaxy familiar to every reader of an astronomical\r\ntext-book. Widely-varying evidence was, as might have been expected,\r\nderived from an examination of different portions of the sky. Some\r\nfields of view were almost blank, while others (in or near the Milky\r\nWay) blazed with the radiance of many hundred stars compressed into an\r\narea about one-fourth that of the full-moon. In the most crowded parts\r\n116,000 were stated to have been passed in review within a quarter of an\r\nhour. Here the \"length of his sounding-line\" was estimated by Herschel\r\nat about 497 times the distance of Sirius--in other words, the bounding\r\norb, or farthest sun of the system in that direction, so far as could be\r\nseen with the 20-foot reflector, was thus inconceivably remote. But\r\nsince the distance of Sirius, no less than of every other fixed star,\r\nwas as yet an unknown quantity, the dimensions inferred for the Galaxy\r\nwere of course purely relative; a knowledge of its form and structure\r\nmight (admitting the truth of the fundamental hypothesis) be obtained,\r\nbut its real or absolute size remained altogether undetermined.\r\n\r\nEven as early as 1785, however, Herschel perceived traces of a tendency\r\nwhich completely invalidated the supposition of any approach to an\r\naverage uniformity of distribution. This was the action of what he\r\ncalled a \"clustering power\" in the Milky Way. \"Many gathering\r\nclusters\"[35] were already discernible to him even while he endeavoured\r\nto obtain a \"true _mean_ result\" on the assumption that each star in\r\nspace was separated from its neighbours as widely as the sun from\r\nSirius. \"It appears,\" he wrote in 1789, \"that the heavens consist of\r\nregions where suns are gathered into separate systems\"; and in certain\r\nassemblages he was able to trace \"a course or tide of stars setting\r\ntowards a centre,\" denoting, not doubtfully, the presence of attractive\r\nforces.[36] Thirteen years later, he described our sun and his\r\nconstellated companions as surrounded by \"a magnificent collection of\r\ninnumerable stars, called the Milky Way, which must occasion a very\r\npowerful balance of opposite attractions to hold the intermediate stars\r\nat rest. For though our sun, and all the stars we see, may truly be said\r\nto be in the plane of the Milky Way, yet I am now convinced, by a long\r\ninspection and continued examination of it, that the Milky Way itself\r\nconsists of stars very differently scattered from those which are\r\nimmediately about us.\" \"This immense aggregation,\" he added, \"is by no\r\nmeans uniform. Its component stars show evident signs of clustering\r\ntogether into many separate allotments.\"[37]\r\n\r\nThe following sentences, written in 1811, contain a definite\r\nretractation of the view frequently attributed to him:--\r\n\r\n\"I must freely confess,\" he says, \"that by continuing my sweeps of the\r\nheavens my opinion of the arrangement of the stars and their magnitudes,\r\nand of some other particulars, has undergone a gradual change; and\r\nindeed, when the novelty of the subject is considered, we cannot be\r\nsurprised that many things formerly taken for granted should on\r\nexamination prove to be different from what they were generally but\r\nincautiously supposed to be. For instance, an equal scattering of the\r\nstars may be admitted in certain calculations; but when we examine the\r\nMilky Way, or the closely compressed clusters of stars of which my\r\ncatalogues have recorded so many instances, this supposed equality of\r\nscattering must be given up.\"[38]\r\n\r\nAnother assumption, the fallacy of which he had not the means of\r\ndetecting since become available, was retained by him to the end of his\r\nlife. It was that the brightness of a star afforded an approximate\r\nmeasure of its distance. Upon this principle he founded in 1817 his\r\nmethod of \"limiting apertures,\"[39] by which two stars, brought into\r\nview in two precisely similar telescopes, were \"equalised\" by covering a\r\ncertain portion of the object-glass collecting the more brilliant rays.\r\nThe distances of the orbs compared were then taken to be in the ratio of\r\nthe reduced to the original apertures of the instruments with which they\r\nwere examined. If indeed the absolute lustre of each were the same, the\r\nresult might be accepted with confidence; but since we have no warrant\r\nfor assuming a \"standard star\" to facilitate our computations, but much\r\nreason to suppose an indefinite range, not only of size but of intrinsic\r\nbrilliancy, in the suns of our firmament, conclusions drawn from such a\r\ncomparison are entirely worthless.\r\n\r\nIn another branch of sidereal science besides that of stellar\r\naggregation, Herschel may justly be styled a pioneer. He was the first\r\nto bestow serious study on the enigmatical objects known as \"nebulæ.\"\r\nThe history of the acquaintance of our race with them is comparatively\r\nshort. The only one recognised before the invention of the telescope was\r\nthat in the girdle of Andromeda, certainly familiar in the middle of the\r\ntenth century to the Persian astronomer Abdurrahman Al-Sûfi; and marked\r\nwith dots on Spanish and Dutch constellation-charts of the fourteenth\r\nand fifteenth centuries.[40] Yet so little was it noticed that it might\r\npractically be said--as far as Europe is concerned--to have been\r\ndiscovered in 1612 by Simon Marius (Mayer of Genzenhausen), who aptly\r\ndescribed its appearance as that of a \"candle shining through horn.\" The\r\nfirst mention of the great Orion nebula is by a Swiss Jesuit named\r\nCysatus, who succeeded Father Scheiner in the chair of mathematics at\r\nIngolstadt. He used it, apparently without any suspicion of its novelty,\r\nas a term of comparison for the comet of December 1618.[41] A novelty,\r\nnevertheless, to astronomers it still remained in 1656, when Huygens\r\ndiscerned, \"as it were, an hiatus in the sky, affording a glimpse of a\r\nmore luminous region beyond.\"[42] Halley in 1716 knew of six nebulæ,\r\nwhich he believed to be composed of a \"lucid medium\" diffused through\r\nthe ether of space.[43] He appears, however, to have been unacquainted\r\nwith some previously noticed by Hevelius. Lacaille brought back with him\r\nfrom the Cape a list of forty-two--the first-fruits of observation in\r\nSouthern skies--arranged in three numerically equal classes;[44] and\r\nMessier (nicknamed by Louis XV. the \"ferret of comets\"), finding such\r\nobjects a source of extreme perplexity in the pursuit of his chosen\r\ngame, attempted to eliminate by methodising them, and drew up a\r\ncatalogue comprising, in 1781, 103 entries.[45]\r\n\r\nThese preliminary attempts shrank into insignificance when Herschel\r\nbegan to \"sweep the heavens\" with his giant telescopes. In 1786 he\r\npresented to the Royal Society a descriptive catalogue of 1,000 nebulæ\r\nand clusters, followed, three years later, by a second of as many more;\r\nto which he added in 1802 a further gleaning of 500. On the subject of\r\ntheir nature his views underwent a remarkable change. Finding that his\r\npotent instruments resolved into stars many nebulous patches in which no\r\nsigns of such a structure had previously been discernible, he naturally\r\nconcluded that \"resolvability\" was merely a question of distance and\r\ntelescopic power. He was (as he said himself) led on by almost\r\nimperceptible degrees from evident clusters, such as the Pleiades, to\r\nspots without a trace of stellar formation, the gradations being so well\r\nconnected as to leave no doubt that all these phenomena were equally\r\nstellar. The singular variety of their appearance was thus described by\r\nhim:--\r\n\r\n\"I have seen,\" he says, \"double and treble nebulæ variously arranged;\r\nlarge ones with small, seeming attendants; narrow, but much extended\r\nlucid nebulæ or bright dashes; some of the shape of a fan, resembling an\r\nelectric brush, issuing from a lucid point; others of the cometic shape,\r\nwith a seeming nucleus in the centre, or like cloudy stars surrounded\r\nwith a nebulous atmosphere; a different sort, again, contain a\r\nnebulosity of the milky kind, like that wonderful, inexplicable\r\nphenomenon about Theta Orionis; while others shine with a fainter,\r\nmottled kind of light, which denotes their being resolvable into\r\nstars.\"[46]\r\n\r\n\"These curious objects\" he considered to be \"no less than whole sidereal\r\nsystems,\"[47] some of which might \"well outvie our Milky Way in\r\ngrandeur.\" He admitted, however, a wide diversity in condition as well\r\nas compass. The system to which our sun belongs he described as \"a very\r\nextensive branching congeries of many millions of stars, which probably\r\nowes its origin to many remarkably large as well as pretty closely\r\nscattered small stars, that may have drawn together the rest.\"[48] But\r\nthe continued action of this same \"clustering power\" would, he supposed,\r\neventually lead to the breaking-up of the original majestic Galaxy into\r\ntwo or three hundred separate groups, already visibly gathering. Such\r\nminor nebulæ, due to the \"decay\" of other \"branching nebulæ\" similar to\r\nour own, he recognised by the score, lying, as it were, stratified in\r\ncertain quarters of the sky. \"One of these nebulous beds,\" he informs\r\nus, \"is so rich that in passing through a section of it, in the time of\r\nonly thirty-six minutes, I detected no less than thirty-one nebulæ, all\r\ndistinctly visible upon a fine blue sky.\" The stratum of Coma Berenices\r\nhe judged to be the nearest to our system of such layers; nor did the\r\nmarked aggregation of nebulæ towards both poles of the circle of the\r\nMilky Way escape his notice.\r\n\r\nBy a continuation of the same process of reasoning, he was enabled (as\r\nhe thought) to trace the life-history of nebulæ from a primitive loose\r\nand extended formation, through clusters of gradually increasing\r\ncompression, down to the kind named by him \"Planetary\" because of the\r\ndefined and uniform discs which they present. These he regarded as \"very\r\naged, and drawing on towards a period of change or dissolution.\"[49]\r\n\r\n\"This method of viewing the heavens,\" he concluded, \"seems to throw them\r\ninto a new kind of light. They now are seen to resemble a luxuriant\r\ngarden which contains the greatest variety of productions in different\r\nflourishing beds; and one advantage we may at least reap from it is,\r\nthat we can, as it were, extend the range of our experience to an\r\nimmense duration. For, to continue the simile which I have borrowed from\r\nthe vegetable kingdom, is it not almost the same thing whether we live\r\nsuccessively to witness the germination, blooming, foliage, fecundity,\r\nfading, withering, and corruption of a plant, or whether a vast number\r\nof specimens, selected from every stage through which the plant passes\r\nin the course of its existence, be brought at once to our view?\"[50]\r\n\r\nBut already this supposed continuity was broken. After mature\r\ndeliberation on the phenomena presented by nebulous stars, Herschel was\r\ninduced, in 1791, to modify essentially his original opinion.\r\n\r\n\"When I pursued these researches,\" he says, \"I was in the situation of a\r\nnatural philosopher who follows the various species of animals and\r\ninsects from the height of their perfection down to the lowest ebb of\r\nlife; when, arriving at the vegetable kingdom, he can scarcely point out\r\nto us the precise boundary where the animal ceases and the plant begins;\r\nand may even go so far as to suspect them not to be essentially\r\ndifferent. But, recollecting himself, he compares, for instance, one of\r\nthe human species to a tree, and all doubt upon the subject vanishes\r\nbefore him. In the same manner we pass through gentle steps from a\r\ncoarse cluster of stars, such as the Pleiades ... till we find ourselves\r\nbrought to an object such as the nebula in Orion, where we are still\r\ninclined to remain in the once adopted idea of stars exceedingly remote\r\nand inconceivably crowded, as being the occasion of that remarkable\r\nappearance. It seems, therefore, to require a more dissimilar object to\r\nset us right again. A glance like that of the naturalist, who casts his\r\neye from the perfect animal to the perfect vegetable, is wanting to\r\nremove the veil from the mind of the astronomer. The object I have\r\nmentioned above is the phenomenon that was wanting for this purpose.\r\nView, for instance, the 19th cluster of my 6th class, and afterwards\r\ncast your eye on this cloudy star, and the result will be no less\r\ndecisive than that of the naturalist we have alluded to. Our judgment, I\r\nmay venture to say, will be, that _the nebulosity about the star is not\r\nof a starry nature_.\"[51]\r\n\r\nThe conviction thus arrived at of the existence in space of a widely\r\ndiffused \"shining fluid\" (a conviction long afterwards fully justified\r\nby the spectroscope) led him into a field of endless speculation. What\r\nwas its nature? Should it \"be compared to the coruscation of the\r\nelectric fluid in the aurora borealis? or to the more magnificent cone\r\nof the zodiacal light?\" Above all, what was its function in the cosmos?\r\nAnd on this point he already gave a hint of the direction in which his\r\nmind was moving by the remark that this self-luminous matter seemed\r\n\"more fit to produce a star by its condensation, than to depend on the\r\nstar for its existence.\"[52]\r\n\r\nThis was not a novel idea. Tycho Brahe had tried to explain the blaze of\r\nthe star of 1572 as due to a sudden concentration of nebulous material\r\nin the Milky Way, even pointing out the space left dark and void by the\r\nwithdrawal of the luminous stuff; and Kepler, theorising on a similar\r\nstellar apparition in 1604, followed nearly in the same track. But under\r\nHerschel's treatment the nebular origin of stars first acquired the\r\nconsistency of a formal theory. He meditated upon it long and earnestly,\r\nand in two elaborate treatises, published respectively in 1811 and 1814,\r\nhe at length set forth the arguments in its favour. These rested\r\nentirely upon the \"principle of continuity.\" Between the successive\r\nclasses of his assortment of developing objects there was, as he said,\r\n\"perhaps not so much difference as would be in an annual description of\r\nthe human figure, were it given from the birth of a child till he comes\r\nto be a man in his prime.\"[53] From diffused nebulosity, barely visible\r\nin the most powerful light-gathering instruments, but which he estimated\r\nto cover nearly 152 square degrees of the heavens,[54] to planetary\r\nnebulæ, supposed to be already centrally solid, instances were alleged\r\nof every stage and phase of condensation. The validity of his reasoning,\r\nhowever, was evidently impaired by his confessed inability to\r\ndistinguish between the dim rays of remote clusters and the milky light\r\nof true gaseous nebulæ.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that such speculations are futile in themselves, and\r\nnecessarily barren of results. But they gratify an inherent tendency of\r\nthe human mind, and, if pursued in a becoming spirit, should be neither\r\nreproved nor disdained. Herschel's theory still holds the field, the\r\ntestimony of recent discoveries with regard to it having proved strongly\r\nconfirmatory of its principle, although not of its details. Strangely\r\nenough, it seems to have been propounded in complete independence of\r\nLaplace's nebular hypothesis as to the origin of the solar system.\r\nIndeed, it dated, as we have seen, in its first inception, from 1791,\r\nwhile the French geometrician's view was not advanced until 1796.\r\n\r\nWe may now briefly sum up the chief results of Herschel's long years of\r\n\"watching the heavens.\" The apparent motions of the stars had been\r\ndisentangled; one portion being clearly shown to be due to a translation\r\ntowards a point in the constellation Hercules of the sun and his\r\nattendant planets; while a large balance of displacement was left to be\r\naccounted for by real movements, various in extent and direction, of the\r\nstars themselves. By the action of a central force similar to, if not\r\nidentical with, gravity, suns of every degree of size and splendour, and\r\nsometimes brilliantly contrasted in colour, were seen to be held\r\ntogether in systems, consisting of two, three, four, even six members,\r\nwhose revolutions exhibited a wide range of variety both in period and\r\nin orbital form. A new department of physical astronomy was thus\r\ncreated,[55] and rigid calculation for the first time made possible\r\nwithin the astral region. The vast problem of the arrangement and\r\nrelations of the millions of stars forming the Milky Way was shown to be\r\ncapable of experimental treatment, and of at least partial solution,\r\nnotwithstanding the variety and complexity seen to prevail, to an extent\r\npreviously undreamt of, in the arrangement of that majestic system. The\r\nexistence of a luminous fluid, diffused through enormous tracts of\r\nspace, and intimately associated with stellar bodies, was virtually\r\ndemonstrated, and its place and use in creation attempted to be divined\r\nby a bold but plausible conjecture. Change on a stupendous scale was\r\ninferred or observed to be everywhere in progress. Periodical stars\r\nshone out and again decayed; progressive ebbings or flowings of light\r\nwere indicated as probable in many stars under no formal suspicion of\r\nvariability; forces were everywhere perceived to be at work, by which\r\nthe very structure of the heavens themselves must be slowly but\r\nfundamentally modified. In all directions groups were seen to be formed\r\nor forming; tides and streams of suns to be setting towards powerful\r\ncentres of attraction; new systems to be in process of formation, while\r\neffete ones hastened to decay or regeneration when the course appointed\r\nfor them by Infinite Wisdom was run. And thus, to quote the words of the\r\nobserver who \"had looked farther into space than ever human being did\r\nbefore him,\"[56] the state into which the incessant action of the\r\nclustering power has brought the Milky Way at present, is a kind of\r\nchronometer that may be used to measure the time of its past and future\r\nexistence; and although we do not know the rate of going of this\r\nmysterious chronometer, it is nevertheless certain that, since the\r\nbreaking-up of the parts of the Milky Way affords a proof that it cannot\r\nlast for ever, it equally bears witness that its past duration cannot be\r\nadmitted to be infinite.[57]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Phil.

Exploration and discovery do not\r\nconstitute the whole business of astronomy; the less adventurous, though\r\nnot less arduous, task of gaining a more and more complete mastery over\r\nthe problems immemorially presented to her, may, on the contrary, be\r\nsaid to form her primary duty. A knowledge of the movements of the\r\nheavenly bodies has, from the earliest times, been demanded by the\r\nurgent needs of mankind; and science finds its advantage, as in many\r\ncases it has taken its origin, in condescension to practical claims.\r\nIndeed, to bring such knowledge as near as possible to absolute\r\nprecision has been defined by no mean authority[58] as the true end of\r\nastronomy.\r\n\r\nSeveral causes concurred about the beginning of the last century to give\r\na fresh and powerful impulse to investigations having this end in view.\r\nThe rapid progress of theory almost compelled a corresponding advance in\r\nobservation; instrumental improvements rendered such an advance\r\npossible; Herschel's discoveries quickened public interest in celestial\r\ninquiries; royal, imperial, and grand-ducal patronage widened the scope\r\nof individual effort. The heart of the new movement was in Germany.\r\nHitherto the observatory of Flamsteed and Bradley had been the\r\nacknowledged centre of practical astronomy; Greenwich observations were\r\nthe standard of reference all over Europe; and the art of observing\r\nprospered in direct proportion to the fidelity with which Greenwich\r\nmethods were imitated. Dr. Maskelyne, who held the post of Astronomer\r\nRoyal during forty-six years (from 1765 to 1811), was no unworthy\r\nsuccessor to the eminent men who had gone before him. His foundation of\r\nthe _Nautical Almanac_ (in 1767) alone constitutes a valid title to\r\nfame; he introduced at the Observatory the important innovation of the\r\nsystematic publication of results; and the careful and prolonged series\r\nof observations executed by him formed the basis of the improved\r\ntheories, and corrected tables of the celestial movements, which were\r\nrapidly being brought to completion abroad. His catalogue of thirty-six\r\n\"fundamental\" stars was besides excellent in its way, and most\r\nserviceable. Yet he was devoid of Bradley's instinct for divining the\r\nneeds of the future. He was fitted rather to continue a tradition than\r\nto found a school. The old ways were dear to him; and, indefatigable as\r\nhe was, a definite purpose was wanting to compel him, by its exigencies,\r\nalong the path of progress. Thus, for almost fifty years after Bradley's\r\ndeath, the acquisition of a small achromatic[59] was the only notable\r\nchange made in the instrumental equipment of the Observatory. The\r\ntransit, the zenith sector, and the mural quadrant, with which Bradley\r\nhad done his incomparable work, retained their places long after they\r\nhad become deteriorated by time and obsolete by the progress of\r\ninvention; and it was not until the very close of his career that\r\nMaskelyne, compelled by Pond's detection of serious errors, ordered a\r\nTroughton's circle, which he did not live to employ.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the heavy national disasters with which Germany was\r\noverwhelmed in the early part of the nineteenth century seemed to\r\nstimulate rather than impede the intellectual revival already for some\r\nyears in progress there. Astronomy was amongst the first of the sciences\r\nto feel the new impulse. By the efforts of Bode, Olbers, Schröter, and\r\nVon Zach, just and elevated ideas on the subject were propagated,\r\nintelligence was diffused, and a firm ground prepared for common action\r\nin mutual sympathy and disinterested zeal. They received powerful aid\r\nthrough the foundation, in 1804, by a young artillery officer named Von\r\nReichenbach, of an Optical and Mechanical Institute at Munich. Here the\r\nwork of English instrumental artists was for the first time rivalled,\r\nand that of English opticians--when Fraunhofer entered the new\r\nestablishment--far surpassed. The development given to the refracting\r\ntelescope by this extraordinary man was indispensable to the progress of\r\nthat fundamental part of astronomy which consists in the exact\r\ndetermination of the places of the heavenly bodies. Reflectors are\r\nbrilliant engines of discovery, but they lend themselves with difficulty\r\nto the prosaic work of measuring right ascensions and polar distances. A\r\nsignal improvement in the art of making and working flint-glass thus\r\nmost opportunely coincided with the rise of a German school of\r\nscientific mechanicians, to furnish the instrumental means needed for\r\nthe reform which was at hand. Of the leader of that reform it is now\r\ntime to speak.\r\n\r\nFriedrich Wilhelm Bessel was born at Minden, in Westphalia, July 22,\r\n1784. A certain taste for figures, coupled with a still stronger\r\ndistaste for the Latin accidence, directed his inclination and his\r\nfather's choice towards a mercantile career. In his fifteenth year,\r\naccordingly, he entered the house of Kuhlenkamp and Sons, in Bremen, as\r\nan apprenticed clerk. He was now thrown completely upon his own\r\nresources. From his father, a struggling Government official, heavily\r\nweighted with a large family, he was well aware that he had nothing to\r\nexpect; his dormant faculties were roused by the necessity for\r\nself-dependence, and he set himself to push manfully forward along the\r\npath that lay before him. The post of supercargo on one of the trading\r\nexpeditions sent out from the Hanseatic towns to China and the East\r\nIndies was the aim of his boyish ambition, for the attainment of which\r\nhe sought to qualify himself by the industrious acquisition of suitable\r\nand useful knowledge. He learned English in two or three months; picked\r\nup Spanish with the casual aid of a gunsmith's apprentice; studied the\r\ngeography of the distant lands which he hoped to visit; collected\r\ninformation as to their climates, inhabitants, products, and the courses\r\nof trade. He desired to add some acquaintance with the art (then much\r\nneglected) of taking observations at sea; and thus, led on from\r\nnavigation to astronomy, and from astronomy to mathematics, he groped\r\nhis way into a new world.\r\n\r\nIt was characteristic of him that the practical problems of science\r\nshould have attracted him before his mind was as yet sufficiently\r\nmatured to feel the charm of its abstract beauties. His first attempt at\r\nobservation was made with a sextant, rudely constructed under his own\r\ndirections, and a common clock. Its object was the determination of the\r\nlongitude of Bremen, and its success, he tells us himself,[60] filled\r\nhim with a rapture of delight, which, by confirming his tastes, decided\r\nhis destiny. He now eagerly studied Bode's _Jahrbuch_ and Von Zach's\r\n_Monatliche Correspondenz_, overcoming each difficulty as it arose with\r\nthe aid of Lalande's _Traité d'Astronomie_, and supplying, with amazing\r\nrapidity, his early deficiency in mathematical training. In two years he\r\nwas able to attack a problem which would have tasked the patience, if\r\nnot the skill, of the most experienced astronomer. Amongst the Earl of\r\nEgremont's papers Von Zach had discovered Harriot's observations on\r\nHalley's comet at its appearance in 1607, and published them as a\r\nsupplement to Bode's Annual. With an elaborate care inspired by his\r\nyouthful ardour, though hardly merited by their loose nature, Bessel\r\ndeduced from them an orbit for that celebrated body, and presented the\r\nwork to Olbers, whose reputation in cometary researches gave a special\r\nfitness to the proffered homage. The benevolent physician-astronomer of\r\nBremen welcomed with surprised delight such a performance emanating from\r\nsuch a source. Fifteen years previously, the French Academy had crowned\r\na similar work; now its equal was produced by a youth of twenty, busily\r\nengaged in commercial pursuits, self-taught, and obliged to snatch from\r\nsleep the hours devoted to study. The paper was immediately sent to Von\r\nZach for publication, with a note from Olbers explaining the\r\ncircumstances of its author; and the name of Bessel became the common\r\nproperty of learned Europe.\r\n\r\nHe had, however, as yet no intention of adopting astronomy as his\r\nprofession. For two years he continued to work in the counting-house by\r\nday, and to pore over the _Mécanique Céleste_ and the Differential\r\nCalculus by night. But the post of assistant in Schröter's observatory\r\nat Lilienthal having become vacant by the removal of Harding to\r\nGöttingen in 1805, Olbers procured for him the offer of it. It was not\r\nwithout a struggle that he resolved to exchange the desk for the\r\ntelescope. His reputation with his employers was of the highest; he had\r\nthoroughly mastered the details of the business, which his keen\r\npractical intelligence followed with lively interest; his years of\r\napprenticeship were on the point of expiring, and an immediate, and not\r\nunwelcome prospect of comparative affluence lay before him. The love of\r\nscience, however, prevailed; he chose poverty and the stars, and went to\r\nLilienthal with a salary of a hundred thalers yearly. Looking back over\r\nhis life's work, Olbers long afterwards declared that the greatest\r\nservice which he had rendered to astronomy was that of having discerned,\r\ndirected, and promoted the genius of Bessel.[61]\r\n\r\nFor four years he continued in Schröter's employment. At the end of that\r\ntime the Prussian Government chose him to superintend the erection of a\r\nnew observatory at Königsberg, which after many vexatious delays, caused\r\nby the prostrate condition of the country, was finished towards the end\r\nof 1813. Königsberg was the first really efficient German observatory.\r\nIt became, moreover, a centre of improvement, not for Germany alone, but\r\nfor the whole astronomical world. During two-and-thirty years it was the\r\nscene of Bessel's labours, and Bessel's labours had for their aim the\r\nreconstruction, on an amended and uniform plan, of the entire science of\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nA knowledge of the places of the stars is the foundation of\r\nastronomy.[62] Their configuration lends to the skies their distinctive\r\nfeatures, and marks out the shifting tracks of more mobile objects with\r\nrelatively fixed, and generally unvarying points of light. A more\r\ndetailed and accurate acquaintance with the stellar multitude, regarded\r\nfrom a purely uranographical point of view, has accordingly formed at\r\nall times a primary object of celestial science, and was, during the\r\nlast century, cultivated with a zeal and success by which all previous\r\nefforts were dwarfed into insignificance. In Lalande's _Histoire\r\nCéleste_, published in 1801, the places of no less than 47,390 stars\r\nwere given, but in the rough, as it were, and consequently needing\r\nlaborious processes of calculation to render them available for exact\r\npurposes. Piazzi set an example of improved methods of observation,\r\nresulting in the publication, in 1803 and 1814, of two catalogues of\r\nabout 7,600 stars--the second being a revision and enlargement of the\r\nfirst--which for their time were models of what such works should\r\nbe.[63] Stephen Groombridge at Blackheath was similarly and most\r\nbeneficially active. But something more was needed than the diligence of\r\nindividual observers. A systematic reform was called for; and it was\r\nthis which Bessel undertook and carried through.\r\n\r\nDirect observation furnishes only what has been called the \"raw\r\nmaterial\" of the positions of the heavenly bodies.[64] A number of\r\nhighly complex corrections have to be applied before their _mean_ can be\r\ndisengaged from their _apparent_ places on the sphere. Of these, the\r\nmost considerable and familiar is atmospheric refraction, by which\r\nobjects seem to stand higher in the sky than they in reality do, the\r\neffect being evanescent at the zenith, and attaining, by gradations\r\nvarying with conditions of pressure and temperature, a maximum at the\r\nhorizon. Moreover, the points to which measurements are referred are\r\nthemselves in motion, either continually in one direction, or\r\nperiodically to and fro. The _precession_ of the equinoxes is slowly\r\nprogressive, or rather retrogressive; the _nutation_ of the pole\r\noscillatory in a period of about eighteen years. Added to which, the\r\nnon-instantaneous transmission of light, combined with the movement of\r\nthe earth in its orbit, causes a small annual displacement known as\r\n_aberration_.\r\n\r\nNow it is easy to see that any uncertainty in the application of these\r\ncorrections saps the very foundations of exact astronomy. Extremely\r\nminute quantities, it is true, are concerned; but the life and progress\r\nof modern celestial science depends upon the sure recognition of\r\nextremely minute quantities. In the early years of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, however, no uniform system of \"reduction\" (so the complete\r\ncorrection of observational results is termed) had been established.\r\nMuch was left to the individual caprice of observers, who selected for\r\nthe several \"elements\" of reduction such values as seemed best to\r\nthemselves. Hence arose much hurtful confusion, tending to hinder united\r\naction and mar the usefulness of laborious researches. For this state of\r\nthings, Bessel, by the exercise of consummate diligence, sagacity, and\r\npatience, provided an entirely satisfactory remedy.\r\n\r\nHis first step was an elaborate investigation of the precious series of\r\nobservations made by Bradley at Greenwich from 1750 until his death in\r\n1762. The catalogue of 3,222 stars which he extracted from them gave the\r\nearliest example of the systematic reduction on a uniform plan of such a\r\nbody of work. It is difficult, without entering into details out of\r\nplace in a volume like the present, to convey an idea of the arduous\r\nnature of this task. It involved the formation of a theory of the errors\r\nof each of Bradley's instruments, and a difficult and delicate inquiry\r\ninto the true value of each correction to be applied, before the entries\r\nin the Greenwich journals could be developed into a finished and\r\nauthentic catalogue. Although completed in 1813, it was not until five\r\nyears later that the results appeared with the proud, but not\r\ninappropriate title of _Fundamenta Astronomiæ_. The eminent value of the\r\nwork consisted in this, that by providing a mass of entirely reliable\r\ninformation as to the state of the heavens at the epoch 1755, it threw\r\nback the beginning of _exact_ astronomy almost half a century. By\r\ncomparison with Piazzi's catalogues the amount of precession was more\r\naccurately determined, the proper motions of a considerable number of\r\nstars became known with certainty, and definite prediction--the\r\ncertificate of initiation into the secrets of Nature--at last became\r\npossible as regards the places of the stars. Bessel's final improvements\r\nin the methods of reduction were published in 1830 in his _Tabulæ\r\nRegiomontanæ_. They not only constituted an advance in accuracy, but\r\nafforded a vast increase of facility in application, and were at once\r\nand everywhere adopted. Thus astronomy became a truly universal science;\r\nuncertainties and disparities were banished, and observations made at\r\nall times and places rendered mutually comparable.[65]\r\n\r\nMore, however, yet remained to be done. In order to verify with greater\r\nstrictness the results drawn from the Bradley and Piazzi catalogues, a\r\nthird term of comparison was wanted, and this Bessel undertook to\r\nsupply. By a course of 75,011 observations, executed during the years\r\n1821-33, with the utmost nicety of care, the number of accurately known\r\nstars was brought up to above 50,000, and an ample store of trustworthy\r\nfacts laid up for the use of future astronomers. In this department\r\nArgelander, whom he attracted from finance to astronomy, and trained in\r\nhis own methods, was his assistant and successor. The great \"Bonn\r\nDurchmusterung,\"[66] in which 324,198 stars visible in the northern\r\nhemisphere are enumerated, and the corresponding \"Atlas\" published in\r\n1857-63, constituting a picture of our sidereal surroundings of\r\nheretofore unapproached completeness, may be justly said to owe their\r\norigin to Bessel's initiative, and to form a sequel to what he\r\ncommenced.\r\n\r\nBut his activity was not solely occupied with the promotion of a\r\ncomprehensive reform in astronomy; it embraced special problems as well.\r\nThe long-baffled search for a parallax of the fixed stars was resumed\r\nwith fresh zeal as each mechanical or optical improvement held out fresh\r\nhopes of a successful issue. Illusory results abounded. Piazza in 1805\r\nperceived, as he supposed, considerable annual displacements in Vega,\r\nAldebaran, Sirius, and Procyon; the truth being that his instruments\r\nwere worn out with constant use, and could no longer be depended\r\nupon.[67] His countryman, Calandrelli, was similarly deluded. The\r\ncelebrated controversy between the Astronomer Royal and Dr. Brinkley,\r\nDirector of the Dublin College Observatory, turned on the same subject.\r\nBrinkley, who was in possession of a first-rate meridian-circle,\r\nbelieved himself to have discovered relatively large parallaxes for four\r\nof the brightest stars; Pond, relying on the testimony of the Greenwich\r\ninstruments, asserted their nullity. The dispute, protracted for\r\nfourteen years, from 1810 until 1824, was brought to no definite\r\nconclusion; but the strong presumption on the negative side was\r\nabundantly justified in the event.\r\n\r\nThere was good reason for incredulity in the matter of parallaxes.\r\nAnnouncements of their detection had become so frequent as to be\r\ndiscredited before they were disproved; and Struve, who investigated the\r\nsubject at Dorpat in 1818-21, had clearly shown that the quantities\r\nconcerned were too small to come within the reliable measuring powers of\r\nany instrument then in use. Already, however, the means were being\r\nprepared of giving to those powers a large increase.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st July, 1801, two old houses in an alley of Munich tumbled\r\ndown, burying in their ruins the occupants, of whom one alone was\r\nextricated alive, though seriously injured. This was an orphan lad of\r\nfourteen named Joseph Fraunhofer. The Elector Maximilian Joseph was\r\nwitness of the scene, became interested in the survivor, and consoled\r\nhis misfortune with a present of eighteen ducats. Seldom was money\r\nbetter bestowed. Part of it went to buy books and a glass-polishing\r\nmachine, with the help of which young Fraunhofer studied mathematics and\r\noptics, and secretly exercised himself in the shaping and finishing of\r\nlenses; the remainder purchased his release from the tyranny of one\r\nWeichselberger, a looking-glass maker by trade, to whom he had been\r\nbound apprentice on the death of his parents. A period of struggle and\r\nprivation followed, during which, however, he rapidly extended his\r\nacquirements; and was thus eminently fitted for the task awaiting him,\r\nwhen, in 1806, he entered the optical department of the establishment\r\nfounded two years previously by Von Reichenbach and Utzschneider. He now\r\nzealously devoted himself to the improvement of the achromatic\r\ntelescope; and, after a prolonged study of the theory of lenses, and\r\nmany toilsome experiments in the manufacture of flint-glass, he\r\nsucceeded in perfecting, December 12, 1817, an object-glass of exquisite\r\nquality and finish, 9-1/2 inches in diameter, and of 14 feet focal\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nThis (as it was then considered) gigantic lens was secured by Struve for\r\nthe Russian Government, and the \"great Dorpat refractor\"--the first of\r\nthe large achromatics which have played such an important part in modern\r\nastronomy--was, late in 1824, set up in the place which it still\r\noccupies. By ingenious improvements in mounting and fitting, it was\r\nadapted to the finest micrometrical work, and thus offered unprecedented\r\nfacilities both for the examination of double stars (in which Struve\r\nchiefly employed it), and for such subtle measurements as might serve to\r\nreveal or disprove the existence of a sensible stellar parallax.\r\nFraunhofer, moreover, constructed for the observatory at Königsberg the\r\nfirst really available heliometer. The principle of this instrument\r\n(termed with more propriety a \"divided object-glass micrometer\") is the\r\nseparation, by a strictly measurable amount, of two distinct images of\r\nthe same object. If a double star, for instance, be under examination,\r\nthe two half-lenses into which the object-glass is divided are shifted\r\nuntil the upper star (say) in one image is brought into coincidence with\r\nthe lower star in the other, when their distance apart becomes known by\r\nthe amount of motion employed.[68]\r\n\r\nThis virtually new engine of research was delivered and mounted in 1829,\r\nthree years after the termination of the life of its deviser. The Dorpat\r\nlens had brought to Fraunhofer a title of nobility and the sole\r\nmanagement of the Munich Optical Institute (completely separated since\r\n1814 from the mechanical department). What he had achieved, however, was\r\nbut a small part of what he meant to achieve. He saw before him the\r\npossibility of nearly quadrupling the light-gathering capacity of the\r\ngreat achromatic acquired by Struve; he meditated improvements in\r\nreflectors as important as those he had already effected in refractors;\r\nand was besides eagerly occupied with investigations into the nature of\r\nlight, the momentous character of which we shall by-and-by have an\r\nopportunity of estimating. But his health was impaired, it is said, from\r\nthe weakening effects of his early accident, combined with excessive and\r\nunwholesome toil, and, still hoping for its restoration from a projected\r\njourney to Italy, he died of consumption, June 7, 1826, aged thirty-nine\r\nyears. His tomb in Munich bears the concise eulogy, _Approximavit\r\nsidera_.\r\n\r\nBessel had no sooner made himself acquainted with the exquisite defining\r\npowers of the Königsberg heliometer, than he resolved to employ them in\r\nan attack upon the now secular problem of star-distances. But it was not\r\nuntil 1837 that he found leisure to pursue the inquiry. In choosing his\r\ntest-star he adopted a new principle. It had hitherto been assumed that\r\nour nearest neighbours in space must be found among the brightest\r\nornaments of our skies. The knowledge of stellar proper motions afforded\r\nby the critical comparison of recent with earlier star-places, suggested\r\na different criterion of distance. It is impossible to escape from the\r\nconclusion that the apparently swiftest-moving stars are, _on the\r\nwhole_, also the nearest to us, however numerous the individual\r\nexceptions to the rule. Now, as early as 1792,[69] Piazzi had noted as\r\nan indication of relative vicinity to the earth, the unusually large\r\nproper motion (5·2\" annually) of a double star of the fifth magnitude in\r\nthe constellation of the Swan. Still more emphatically in 1812[70]\r\nBessel drew the attention of astronomers to the fact, and 61 Cygni\r\nbecame known as the \"flying star.\" The _seeming_ rate of its flight,\r\nindeed, is of so leisurely a kind, that in a thousand years it will have\r\nshifted its place by less than 3-1/2 lunar diameters, and that a quarter\r\nof a million would be required to carry it round the entire circuit of\r\nthe visible heavens. Nevertheless, it has few rivals in rapidity of\r\nmovement, the apparent displacement of the vast majority of stars being,\r\nby comparison, almost insensible.\r\n\r\nThis interesting, though inconspicuous object, then, was chosen by\r\nBessel to be put to the question with his heliometer, while Struve made\r\na similar and somewhat earlier trial with the bright gem of the Lyre,\r\nwhose Arabic title of the \"Falling Eagle\" survives as a time-worn\r\nremnant in \"Vega.\" Both astronomers agreed to use the \"differential\"\r\nmethod, for which their instruments and the vicinity to their selected\r\nstars of minute, physically detached companions offered special\r\nfacilities. In the last month of 1838 Bessel made known the result of\r\none year's observations, showing for 61 Cygni a parallax of about a\r\nthird of a second (0·3136\").[71] He then had his heliometer taken down\r\nand repaired, after which he resumed the inquiry, and finally terminated\r\na series of 402 measures in March 1840.[72] The resulting parallax of\r\n0·3483\" (corresponding to a distance about 600,000 times that of the\r\nearth from the sun), seemed to be ascertained beyond the possibility of\r\ncavil, and is memorable as the first _published_ instance of the\r\nfathom-line, so industriously thrown into celestial space, having really\r\nand indubitably _touched bottom_. It was confirmed in 1842-43 with\r\ncurious exactness by C. A. F. Peters at Pulkowa; but later researches\r\nshowed that it required increase to nearly half a second.[73]\r\n\r\nStruve's measurements inspired less confidence. They extended over three\r\nyears (1835-38), but were comparatively few, and were frequently\r\ninterrupted. The parallax, accordingly, of about a quarter of a second\r\n(0·2613\") which he derived from them for Alpha Lyræ, and announced\r\nin 1840,[74] has proved considerably too large.[75]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a result of the same kind, but of a more striking character\r\nthan either Bessel's or Struve's, had been obtained, one might almost\r\nsay casually, by a different method and in a distant region. Thomas\r\nHenderson, originally an attorney's clerk in his native town of Dundee,\r\nhad become known for his astronomical attainments, and was appointed in\r\n1831 to direct the recently completed observatory at the Cape of Good\r\nHope. He began observing in April, 1832, and, the serious shortcomings\r\nof his instrument notwithstanding, executed during the thirteen months\r\nof his tenure of office a surprising amount of first-rate work. With a\r\nview to correcting the declination of the lustrous double star Alpha\r\nCentauri (which ranks after Sirius and Canopus as the third brightest\r\norb in the heavens), he effected a number of successive determinations\r\nof its position, and on being informed of its very considerable proper\r\nmotion (3·6\" annually), he resolved to examine the observations already\r\nmade for possible traces of parallactic displacement. This was done on\r\nhis return to Scotland, where he filled the office of Astronomer Royal\r\nfrom 1834 until his premature death in 1844. The result justified his\r\nexpectations. From the declination measurements made at the Cape and\r\nduly reduced, a parallax of about one second of arc clearly emerged\r\n(diminished by Gill's and Elkin's observations, 1882-1883, to O·75\");\r\nbut, by perhaps an excess of caution, was withheld from publication\r\nuntil fuller certainty was afforded by the concurrent testimony of\r\nLieutenant Meadows's determinations of the same star's right\r\nascension.[76] When at last, January 9, 1839, Henderson communicated his\r\ndiscovery to the Astronomical Society, he could no longer claim the\r\npriority which was his due. Bessel had anticipated him with the parallax\r\nof 61 Cygni by just two months.\r\n\r\nThus from three different quarters, three successful and almost\r\nsimultaneous assaults were delivered upon a long-beleaguered citadel of\r\ncelestial secrets. The same work has since been steadily pursued, with\r\nthe general result of showing that, as regards their overwhelming\r\nmajority, the stars are far too remote to show even the slightest trace\r\nof optical shifting from the revolution of the earth in its orbit. In\r\nnearly a hundred cases, however, small parallaxes have been determined,\r\nsome certainly (that is, within moderate limits of error), others more\r\nor less precariously. The list is an instructive one, in its omissions\r\nno less than in its contents. It includes stars of many degrees of\r\nbrightness, from Sirius down to a nameless telescopic star in the Great\r\nBear;[77] yet the vicinity to the earth of this minute object is so much\r\ngreater than that of the brilliant Vega, that the latter transported to\r\nits place would increase in lustre thirty-eight times. Moreover, many of\r\nthe brightest stars are found to have no sensible parallax, while the\r\nmajority of those ascertained to be nearest to the earth are of fifth,\r\nsixth, even ninth magnitudes. The obvious conclusions follow that the\r\nrange of variety in the sidereal system is enormously greater than had\r\nbeen supposed, and that estimates of distance based upon apparent\r\nmagnitude must be wholly futile. Thus, the splendid Canopus, Betelgeux,\r\nand Rigel can be inferred, from their indefinite remoteness, to exceed\r\nour sun thousands of times in size and lustre; while many inconspicuous\r\nobjects, which prove to be in our relative vicinity, must be notably his\r\ninferiors. The limits of real stellar magnitude are then set very widely\r\napart. At the same time, the so-called \"optical\" and \"geometrical\"\r\nmethods of relatively estimating star-distances are both seen to have a\r\nfoundation of fact, although so disguised by complicated relations as to\r\nbe of very doubtful individual application. On the whole, the chances\r\nare in favour of the superior vicinity of a bright star over a faint\r\none; and, on the whole, the stars in swiftest _apparent_ motion are\r\namongst those whose _actual_ remoteness is least. Indeed, there is no\r\nescape from either conclusion, unless on the supposition of special\r\narrangements in themselves highly improbable, and, we may confidently\r\nsay, non-existent.\r\n\r\nThe distances even of the few stars found to have measurable parallaxes\r\nare on a scale entirely beyond the powers of the human mind to conceive.\r\nIn the attempt both to realize them distinctly, and to express them\r\nconveniently, a new unit of length, itself of bewildering magnitude, has\r\noriginated. This is what we may call the _light-journey_ of one year.\r\nThe subtle vibrations of the ether, propagated on all sides from the\r\nsurface of luminous bodies, travel at the rate of 186,300 miles a\r\nsecond, or (in round numbers) six billions of miles a year. Four and a\r\nthird such measures are needed to span the abyss that separates us from\r\nthe nearest fixed star. In other words, light takes four years and four\r\nmonths to reach the earth from Alpha Centauri; yet Alpha Centauri lies\r\nsome ten billions of miles nearer to us (so far as is yet known) than\r\nany other member of the sidereal system!\r\n\r\nThe determination of parallax leads, in the case of stars revolving in\r\nknown orbits, to the determination of mass; for the distance from the\r\nearth of the two bodies forming a binary system being ascertained, the\r\nseconds of arc apparently separating them from each other can be\r\ntranslated into millions of miles; and we only need to add a knowledge\r\nof their period to enable us, by an easy sum in proportion, to find\r\ntheir combined mass in terms of that of the sun. Thus, since--according\r\nto Dr. Doberck's elements--the components of Alpha Centauri revolve\r\nround their common centre of gravity at a mean distance nearly 25 times\r\nthe radius of the earth's orbit, in a period of 88 years, the attractive\r\nforce of the two together must be just twice the solar. We may gather\r\nsome idea of their relations by placing in imagination a second luminary\r\nlike our sun in circulation between the orbits of Neptune and Uranus.\r\nBut systems of still more majestic proportions are reduced by extreme\r\nremoteness to apparent insignificance. A double star of the fourth\r\nmagnitude in Cassiopeia (Eta), to which a small parallax is ascribed on\r\nthe authority of O. Struve, appears to be above eight times as massive\r\nas the central orb of our world; while a much less conspicuous pair--85\r\nPegasi--exerts, if the available data can be depended upon, no less than\r\nthirteen times the solar gravitating power.\r\n\r\nFurther, the actual rate of proper motions, so far as regards that part\r\nof them which is projected upon the sphere, can be ascertained for stars\r\nat known distance. The annual journey, for instance, of 61 Cygni _across\r\nthe line of sight_ amounts to 1,000, and that of Alpha Centauri to\r\n446 millions of miles. A small star, numbered 1,830 in Groombridge's\r\nCircumpolar Catalogue, \"devours the way\" at the rate of at least 150\r\nmiles a second--a speed, in Newcomb's opinion, beyond the gravitating\r\npower of the entire sidereal system to control; and Mu Cassiopeiæ\r\npossesses above two-thirds of that surprising velocity; while for both\r\nobjects, radial movements of just sixty miles a second were disclosed\r\nby Professor Campbell's spectroscopic measurements.\r\n\r\nHerschel's conclusion as to the advance of the sun among the stars was\r\nnot admitted as valid by the most eminent of his successors. Bessel\r\nmaintained that there was absolutely no preponderating evidence in\r\nfavour of its supposed direction towards a point in the constellation\r\nHercules.[78] Biot, Burckhardt, even Herschel's own son, shared his\r\nincredulity. But the appearance of Argelander's prize-essay in 1837[79]\r\nchanged the aspect of the question. Herschel's first memorable solution\r\nin 1783 was based upon the motions of thirteen stars, imperfectly known;\r\nhis second, in 1805, upon those of no more than six. Argelander now\r\nobtained an entirely concordant result from the large number of 390,\r\ndetermined with the scrupulous accuracy characteristic of Bessel's work\r\nand his own. The reality of the fact thus persistently disclosed could\r\nno longer be doubted; it was confirmed five years later by the younger\r\nStruve, and still more strikingly in 1847[80] by Galloway's\r\ninvestigations, founded exclusively on the apparent displacements of\r\nsouthern stars. In 1859 and 1863, Sir George Airy and Mr. Dunkin\r\n(1821-1898),[81] employing all the resources of modern science, and\r\ncommanding the wealth of material furnished by 1,167 proper motions\r\ncarefully determined by Mr. Main, reached conclusions closely similar to\r\nthat indicated nearly eighty years previously by the first great\r\nsidereal astronomer; which Mr. Plummer's reinvestigation of the subject\r\nin 1883[82] served but slightly to modify. Yet astronomers were not\r\nsatisfied. Dr. Auwers of Berlin completed in 1866 a splendid piece of\r\nwork, for which he received in 1888 the Gold Medal of the Royal\r\nAstronomical Society. It consisted in reducing afresh, with the aid of\r\nthe most refined modern data, Bradley's original stars, and comparing\r\ntheir places thus obtained for the year 1755 with those assigned to them\r\nfrom observations made at Greenwich after the lapse of ninety years. In\r\nthe interval, as was to be anticipated, most of them were found to have\r\ntravelled over some small span of the heavens, and there resulted a\r\nstock of nearly three thousand highly authentic proper motions. These\r\nample materials were turned to account by M. Ludwig Struve[83] for a\r\ndiscussion of the sun's motion, of which the upshot was to shift its\r\npoint of aim to the bordering region of the constellations Hercules and\r\nLyra. And the more easterly position of the solar apex was fully\r\nconfirmed by the experiments, with variously assorted lists of stars, of\r\nLewis Boss of Albany,[84] and Oscar Stumpe of Bonn.[85] Fresh\r\nprecautions of refinement were introduced into the treatment of the\r\nsubject by Ristenpart of Karlsruhe,[86] by Kapteyn of Groningen,[87] by\r\nNewcomb[88] and Porter[89] in America, who ably availed themselves of\r\nthe copious materials accumulated before the close of the century. Their\r\nresults, although not more closely accordant than those of their\r\npredecessors, combined to show that the journey of our system is\r\ndirected towards a point within a circle about ten degrees in radius,\r\nhaving the brilliant Vega for its centre. To determine its rate was a\r\nstill more arduous problem. It involved the assumption, very much at\r\ndiscretion, of an average parallax for the stars investigated; and Otto\r\nStruve's estimate of 154 million miles as the span yearly traversed was\r\nhence wholly unreliable. Fortunately, however, as will be seen further\r\non, a method of determining the sun's velocity independently of any\r\nknowledge of star-distances, has now become available.\r\n\r\nAs might have been expected, speculation has not been idle regarding the\r\npurpose and goal of the strange voyage of discovery through space upon\r\nwhich our system is embarked; but altogether fruitlessly. The variety of\r\nthe conjectures hazarded in the matter is in itself a measure of their\r\nfutility. Long ago, before the construction of the heavens had as yet\r\nbeen made the subject of methodical inquiry, Kant was disposed to regard\r\nSirius as the \"central sun\" of the Milky Way; while Lambert surmised\r\nthat the vast Orion nebula might serve as the regulating power of a\r\nsubordinate group including our sun. Herschel threw out the hint that\r\nthe great cluster in Hercules might prove to be the supreme seat of\r\nattractive force;[90] Argelander placed his central body in the\r\nconstellation Perseus;[91] Fomalhaut, the brilliant of the Southern\r\nFish, was set in the post of honour by Boguslawski of Breslau. Mädler\r\n(who succeeded Struve at Dorpat in 1839) concluded from a more formal\r\ninquiry that the ruling power in the sidereal system resided, not in any\r\nsingle prepondering mass, but in the centre of gravity of the\r\nself-controlled revolving multitude.[92] In the former case (as we know\r\nfrom the example of the planetary scheme), the stellar motions would be\r\nmost rapid near the centre; in the latter, they would become accelerated\r\nwith remoteness from it.[93] Mädler showed that no part of the heavens\r\ncould be indicated as a region of exceptionally swift movements, such as\r\nwould result from the presence of a gigantic (though possibly obscure)\r\nruling body; but that a community of extremely sluggish movements\r\nundoubtedly existed in and near the group of the Pleiades, where,\r\naccordingly, he placed the centre of gravity of the Milky Way.[94] The\r\nbright star Alcyone thus became the \"central sun,\" but in a purely\r\npassive sense, its headship being determined by its situation at the\r\npoint of neutralisation of opposing tendencies, and of consequent rest.\r\nBy an avowedly conjectural method, the solar period of revolution round\r\nthis point was fixed at 18,200,000 years.\r\n\r\nThe scheme of sidereal government framed by the Dorpat astronomer was,\r\nit may be observed, of the most approved constitutional type;\r\ndeprivation, rather than increase of influence accompanying the office\r\nof chief dignitary. But while we are still ignorant, and shall perhaps\r\never remain so, of the fundamental plan upon which the Galaxy is\r\norganised, recent investigations tend more and more to exhibit it, not\r\nas monarchical (so to speak), but as federative. The community of proper\r\nmotions detected by Mädler in the vicinity of the Pleiades may\r\naccordingly possess a significance altogether different from what he\r\nimagined.\r\n\r\nBessel's so-called \"foundation of an Astronomy of the Invisible\" now\r\nclaims attention.[95] His prediction regarding the planet Neptune does\r\nnot belong to the present division of our subject; a strictly analogous\r\ndiscovery in the sidereal system was, however, also very clearly\r\nforeshadowed by him. His earliest suspicions of non-uniformity in the\r\nproper motion of Sirius dated from 1834; they extended to Procyon in\r\n1840; and after a series of refined measurements with the new Repsold\r\ncircle, he announced in 1844 his conclusion that these irregularities\r\nwere due to the presence of obscure bodies round which the two bright\r\nDog-stars revolved as they pursued their way across the sphere.[96] He\r\neven assigned to each an approximate period of half a century. \"I adhere\r\nto the conviction,\" he wrote later to Humboldt, \"that Procyon and Sirius\r\nform real binary systems, consisting of a visible and an invisible star.\r\nThere is no reason to suppose luminosity an essential quality of\r\ncosmical bodies. The visibility of countless stars is no argument\r\nagainst the invisibility of countless others.\"[97]\r\n\r\nAn inference so contradictory to received ideas obtained little credit,\r\nuntil Peters found, in 1851,[98] that the apparent anomalies in the\r\nmovements of Sirius could be completely explained by an orbital\r\nrevolution in a period of fifty years. Bessel's prevision was destined\r\nto be still more triumphantly vindicated. On the 31st of January, 1862,\r\nwhile in the act of trying a new 18-inch refractor, Mr. Alvan G. Clark\r\n(one of the celebrated firm of American opticians) actually discovered\r\nthe hypothetical Sirian companion in the precise position required by\r\ntheory. It has now been watched through nearly an entire revolution\r\n(period 49·4 years), and proves to be very slightly luminous in\r\nproportion to its mass. Its attractive power, in fact, is nearly half\r\nthat of its primary, while it emits only 1/10000th of its light. Sirius\r\nitself, on the other hand, possesses a far higher radiative intensity\r\nthan our sun. It gravitates--admitting Sir David Gill's parallax of\r\n0·38\" to be exact--like two suns, but shines like twenty. Possibly it is\r\nmuch distended by heat, and undoubtedly its atmosphere intercepts a very\r\nmuch smaller proportion of its light than in stars of the solar class.\r\nAs regards Procyon, visual verification was awaited until November 13,\r\n1896, when Professor Schaeberle, with the great Lick refractor, detected\r\nthe long-sought object in the guise of a thirteenth-magnitude star. Dr.\r\nSee's calculations[99] showed it to possess one-fifth the mass of its\r\nprimary, or rather more than half that of our sun.[100] Yet it gives\r\nbarely 1/20000th of the sun's light, so that it is still nearer to total\r\nobscurity than the dusky satellite of Sirius. The period of forty years\r\nassigned to the system by Auwers in 1862[101] appears to be singularly\r\nexact.\r\n\r\nBut Bessel was not destined to witness the recognition of \"the\r\ninvisible\" as a legitimate and profitable field for astronomical\r\nresearch. He died March 17, 1846, just six months before the discovery\r\nof Neptune, of an obscure disease, eventually found to be occasioned by\r\nan extensive fungus-growth in the stomach. The place which he left\r\nvacant was not one easy to fill. His life's work might be truly\r\ndescribed as \"epoch-making.\" Rarely indeed shall we find one who\r\nreconciled with the same success the claims of theoretical and practical\r\nastronomy, or surveyed the science which he had made his own with a\r\nglance equally comprehensive, practical, and profound.\r\n\r\nThe career of Friedrich Georg Wilhelm Struve illustrates the maxim that\r\nscience _differentiates_ as it develops. He was, while much besides, a\r\nspecialist in double stars. His earliest recorded use of the telescope\r\nwas to verify Herschel's conclusion as to the revolving movement of\r\nCastor, and he never varied from the predilection which this first\r\nobservation at once indicated and determined. He was born at Altona, of\r\na respectable yeoman family, April 15, 1793, and in 1811 took a degree\r\nin philology at the new Russian University of Dorpat. He then turned to\r\nscience, was appointed in 1813 to a professorship of astronomy and\r\nmathematics, and began regular work in the Dorpat Observatory just\r\nerected by Parrot for Alexander I. It was not, however, until 1819 that\r\nthe acquisition of a 5-foot refractor by Troughton enabled him to take\r\nthe position-angles of double stars with regularity and tolerable\r\nprecision. The resulting catalogue of 795 stellar systems gave the\r\nsignal for a general resumption of the Herschelian labours in this\r\nbranch. His success, so far, and the extraordinary facilities for\r\nobservation afforded by the Fraunhofer achromatic encouraged him to\r\nundertake, February 11, 1825, a review of the entire heavens down to 15°\r\nsouth of the celestial equator, which occupied more than two years, and\r\nyielded, from an examination of above 120,000 stars, a harvest of about\r\n2,200 previously unnoticed composite objects. The ensuing ten years were\r\ndevoted to delicate and patient measurements, the results of which were\r\nembodied in _Mensuræ Micrometricæ_, published at St. Petersburg in 1837.\r\nThis monumental work gives the places, angles of position, distances,\r\ncolours, and relative brightness of 3,112 double and multiple stars, all\r\ndetermined with the utmost skill and care. The record is one which gains\r\nin value with the process of time, and will for ages serve as a standard\r\nof reference by which to detect change or confirm discovery.\r\n\r\nIt appears from Struve's researches that about one in forty of all stars\r\ndown to the ninth magnitude is composite, but that the proportion is\r\ndoubled in the brighter orders.[102] This he attributed to the\r\ndifficulty of detecting the faint companions of very remote orbs. It was\r\nalso noticed, both by him and Bessel, that double stars are in general\r\nremarkable for large proper motions. Struve's catalogue included no star\r\nof which the components were more than 32\" apart, because beyond that\r\ndistance the chances of merely optical juxtaposition become\r\nconsiderable; but the immense preponderance of extremely close over (as\r\nit were) loosely yoked bodies is such as to demonstrate their physical\r\nconnection, even if no other proof were forthcoming. Many stars\r\npreviously believed to be single divided under the scrutiny of the\r\nDorpat refractor; while in some cases, one member of a supposed binary\r\nsystem revealed itself as double, thus placing the surprised observer in\r\nthe unexpected presence of a triple group of suns. Five instances were\r\nnoted of two pairs lying so close together as to induce a conviction of\r\ntheir mutual dependence;[103] besides which, 124 examples occurred of\r\ntriple, quadruple, and multiple combinations, the reality of which was\r\nopen to no reasonable doubt.[104]\r\n\r\nIt was first pointed out by Bessel that the fact of stars exhibiting a\r\ncommon proper motion might serve as an unfailing test of their real\r\nassociation into systems. This was, accordingly, one of the chief\r\ncriteria employed by Struve to distinguish true binaries from merely\r\noptical couples. On this ground alone, 61 Cygni was admitted to be a\r\ngenuine double star; and it was shown that, although its components\r\nappeared to follow almost strictly rectilinear paths, yet the\r\nprobability of their forming a connected pair is actually greater than\r\nthat of the sun rising to-morrow morning.[105] Moreover, this tie of an\r\nidentical movement was discovered to unite bodies[106] far beyond the\r\nrange of distance ordinarily separating the members of binary systems,\r\nand to prevail so extensively as to lead to the conclusion that single\r\ndo not outnumber conjoined stars more than twice or thrice.[107]\r\n\r\nIn 1835 Struve was summoned by the Emperor Nicholas to superintend the\r\nerection of a new observatory at Pulkowa, near St. Petersburg, destined\r\nfor the special cultivation of sidereal astronomy. Boundless resources\r\nwere placed at his disposal, and the institution created by him was\r\nacknowledged to surpass all others of its kind in splendour, efficiency,\r\nand completeness. Its chief instrumental glory was a refractor of\r\nfifteen inches aperture by Merz and Mahler (Fraunhofer's successors),\r\nwhich left the famous Dorpat telescope far behind, and remained long\r\nwithout a rival. On the completion of this model establishment, August\r\n19, 1839, Struve was installed as its director, and continued to fulfil\r\nthe important duties of the post with his accustomed vigour until 1858,\r\nwhen illness compelled his virtual resignation in favour of his son Otto\r\nStruve, born at Dorpat in 1819. He died November 23, 1864.\r\n\r\nAn inquiry into the laws of stellar distribution, undertaken during the\r\nearly years of his residence at Pulkowa, led Struve to confirm in the\r\nmain the inferences arrived at by Herschel as to the construction of the\r\nheavens. According to his view, the appearance known as the Milky Way is\r\nproduced by a collection of irregularly condensed star-clusters, within\r\nwhich the sun is somewhat eccentrically placed. The nebulous ring which\r\nthus integrates the light of countless worlds was supposed by him to be\r\nmade up of stars scattered over a bent or \"broken plane,\" or to lie in\r\ntwo planes slightly inclined to each other, our system occupying a\r\nposition near their intersection.[108] He further attempted to show that\r\nthe limits of this vast assemblage must remain for ever shrouded from\r\nhuman discernment, owing to the gradual extinction of light in its\r\npassage through space,[109] and sought to confer upon this celebrated\r\nhypothesis a definiteness and certainty far beyond the aspirations of\r\nits earlier advocates, Chéseaux and Olbers; but arbitrary assumptions\r\nvitiated his reasonings on this, as well as on some other points.[110]\r\n\r\nIn his special line as a celestial explorer of the most comprehensive\r\ntype, Sir William Herschel had but one legitimate successor, and that\r\nsuccessor was his son. John Frederick William Herschel was born at\r\nSlough, March 17, 1792, graduated with the highest honours from St.\r\nJohn's College, Cambridge, in 1813, and entered upon legal studies with\r\na view to being called to the Bar. But his share in an early compact\r\nwith Peacock and Babbage, \"to do their best to leave the world wiser\r\nthan they found it,\" was not thus to be fulfilled. The acquaintance of\r\nDr. Wollaston decided his scientific vocation. Already, in 1816, we find\r\nhim reviewing some of his father's double stars; and he completed in\r\n1820 the 18-inch speculum which was to be the chief instrument of his\r\ninvestigations. Soon afterwards, he undertook, in conjunction with Mr.\r\n(later Sir James) South, a series of observations, issuing in the\r\npresentation to the Royal Society of a paper[111] containing\r\nmicrometrical measurements of 380 binary stars, by which the elder\r\nHerschel's inferences of orbital motion were, in many cases, strikingly\r\nconfirmed. A star in the Northern Crown, for instance (Eta Coronæ),\r\nhad completed more than one entire circuit since its first discovery;\r\nanother, Tau Ophiuchi, had _closed up_ into apparent singleness; while\r\nthe motion of a third, Xi Ursæ Majoris, in an obviously eccentric orbit,\r\nwas so rapid as to admit of being traced and measured from month to month.\r\n\r\nIt was from the first confidently believed that the force retaining\r\ndouble stars in curvilinear paths was identical with that governing the\r\nplanetary revolutions. But that identity was not ascertained until\r\nSavary of Paris showed, in 1827,[112] that the movements of the\r\nabove-named binary in the Great Bear could be represented with all\r\nattainable accuracy by an ellipse calculated on orthodox gravitational\r\nprinciples with a period of 58-1/4 years. Encke followed at Berlin with\r\na still more elegant method; and Sir John Herschel, pointing out the\r\nuselessness of analytical refinements where the data were necessarily so\r\nimperfect, described in 1832 a graphical process by which \"the aid of\r\nthe eye and hand\" was brought in \"to guide the judgment in a case where\r\njudgment only, and not calculation, could be of any avail.\"[113]\r\nImproved methods of the same kind were published by Dr. See in\r\n1893,[114] and by Mr. Burnham in 1894;[115] and our acquaintance with\r\nstellar orbits is steadily gaining precision, certainty, and extent.\r\n\r\nIn 1825 Herschel undertook, and executed with great assiduity during the\r\nensuing eight years, a general survey of the northern heavens, directed\r\nchiefly towards the verification of his father's nebular discoveries.\r\nThe outcome was a catalogue of 2,306 nebulæ and clusters, of which 525\r\nwere observed for the first time, besides 3,347 double stars discovered\r\nalmost incidentally.[116] \"Strongly invited,\" as he tells us himself,\r\n\"by the peculiar interest of the subject, and the wonderful nature of\r\nthe objects which presented themselves,\" he resolved to attempt the\r\ncompletion of the survey in the southern hemisphere. With this noble\r\nobject in view, he embarked his family and instruments on board the\r\n_Mount Stewart Elphinstone_, and, after a prosperous voyage, landed at\r\nCape Town on the 16th of January, 1834. Choosing as the scene of his\r\nobservations a rural spot under the shelter of Table Mountain, he began\r\nregular \"sweeping\" on the 5th of March. The site of his great reflector\r\nis now marked with an obelisk, and the name of Feldhausen has become\r\nmemorable in the history of science; for the four years' work done there\r\nmay truly be said to open the chapter of our knowledge as regards the\r\nsouthern skies.\r\n\r\nThe full results of Herschel's journey to the Cape were not made public\r\nuntil 1847, when a splendid volume[117] embodying them was brought out\r\nat the expense of the Duke of Northumberland. They form a sequel to his\r\nfather's labours such as the investigations of one man have rarely\r\nreceived from those of another. What the elder observer did for the\r\nnorthern heavens, the younger did for the southern, and with generally\r\nconcordant results. Reviving the paternal method of \"star-gauging,\" he\r\nshowed, from a count of 2,299 fields, that the Milky Way surrounds the\r\nsolar system as a complete annulus of minute stars; not, however, quite\r\nsymmetrically, since the sun was thought to lie somewhat nearer to those\r\nportions visible in the southern hemisphere, which display a brighter\r\nlustre and a more complicated structure than the northern branches. The\r\nsingular cosmical agglomerations known as the \"Magellanic Clouds\" were\r\nnow, for the first time, submitted to a detailed, though admittedly\r\nincomplete, examination, the almost inconceivable richness and variety\r\nof their contents being such that a lifetime might with great profit be\r\ndevoted to their study. In the Greater Nubecula, within a compass of\r\nforty-two square degrees, Herschel reckoned 278 distinct nebulæ and\r\nclusters, besides fifty or sixty outliers, and a large number of stars\r\nintermixed with diffused nebulosity--in all, 919 catalogued objects,\r\nand, for the Lesser Cloud, 244. Yet this was only the most conspicuous\r\npart of what his twenty-foot revealed. Such an extraordinary\r\nconcentration of bodies so various led him to the inevitable conclusion\r\nthat \"the Nubeculæ are to be regarded as systems _sui generis_, and\r\nwhich have no analogues in our hemisphere.\"[118] He noted also the\r\nblankness of surrounding space, especially in the case of Nubecula\r\nMinor, \"the access to which on all sides,\" he remarked, \"is through a\r\ndesert;\" as if the cosmical material in the neighbourhood had been swept\r\nup and garnered in these mighty groups.[119]\r\n\r\nOf southern double stars, he discovered and gave careful measurements of\r\n2,102, and described 1,708 nebulæ, of which at least 300 were new. The\r\nlist was illustrated with a number of drawings, some of them extremely\r\nbeautiful and elaborate.\r\n\r\nSir John Herschel's views as to the nature of nebulæ were considerably\r\nmodified by Lord Rosse's success in \"resolving\" with his great\r\nreflectors a crowd of these objects into stars. His former somewhat\r\nhesitating belief in the existence of phosphorescent matter,\r\n\"disseminated through extensive regions of space in the manner of a\r\ncloud or fog,\"[120] was changed into a conviction that no valid\r\ndistinction could be established between the faintest wisp of cosmical\r\nvapour just discernible in a powerful telescope, and the most brilliant\r\nand obvious cluster. He admitted, however, an immense range of possible\r\nvariety in the size and mode of aggregation of the stellar constituents\r\nof various nebulæ. Some might appear nebulous from the closeness of\r\ntheir parts; some from their smallness. Others, he suggested, might be\r\nformed of \"discrete luminous bodies floating in a non-luminous\r\nmedium;\"[121] while the annular kind probably consisted of \"hollow\r\nshells of stars.\"[122] That a physical, and not merely an optical,\r\nconnection unites nebulæ with the _embroidery_ (so to speak) of small\r\nstars with which they are in many instances profusely decorated, was\r\nevident to him, as it must be to all who look as closely and see as\r\nclearly as he did. His description of No. 2,093 in his northern\r\ncatalogue as \"a network or tracery of nebula following the lines of a\r\nsimilar network of stars,\"[123] would alone suffice to dispel the idea\r\nof accidental scattering; and many other examples of a like import might\r\nbe quoted. The remarkably frequent occurrence of one or more minute\r\nstars in the close vicinity of \"planetary\" nebulæ led him to infer their\r\ndependent condition; and he advised the maintenance of a strict watch\r\nfor evidences of circulatory movements, not only over these supposed\r\nstellar satellites, but also over the numerous \"double nebulæ,\" in\r\nwhich, as he pointed out, \"all the varieties of double stars as to\r\ndistance, position, and relative brightness, have their counterparts.\"\r\nHe, moreover, investigated the subject of nebular distribution by the\r\nsimple and effectual method of graphic delineation or \"charting,\" and\r\nsucceeded in showing that while a much greater uniformity of scattering\r\nprevails in the southern than in the northern heavens, a condensation is\r\nnevertheless perceptible about the constellations Pisces and Cetus,\r\nroughly corresponding to the \"nebular region\" in Virgo by its vicinity\r\n(within 20° or 30°) to the opposite pole of the Milky Way. He concluded\r\n\"that the nebulous system is distinct from the sidereal, though\r\ninvolving, and perhaps to a certain extent intermixed with, the\r\nlatter.\"[124]\r\n\r\nTowards the close of his residence at Feldhausen, Herschel was fortunate\r\nenough to witness one of those singular changes in the aspect of the\r\nfirmament which occasionally challenge the attention even of the\r\nincurious, and excite the deepest wonder of the philosophical observer.\r\nImmersed apparently in the Argo nebula is a star denominated Eta\r\nCarinæ. When Halley visited St. Helena in 1677, it seemed of the fourth\r\nmagnitude; but Lacaille in the middle of the following century, and\r\nothers after him, classed it as of the second. In 1827 the traveller\r\nBurchell, being then at St. Paul, near Rio Janeiro, remarked that it had\r\nunexpectedly assumed the first rank--a circumstance the more surprising\r\nto him because he had frequently, when in Africa during the years 1811\r\nto 1815, noted it as of only fourth magnitude. This observation,\r\nhowever, did not become generally known until later. Herschel, on his\r\narrival at Feldhausen, registered the star as a bright second, and had\r\nno suspicion of its unusual character until December 16, 1837, when he\r\nsuddenly perceived its light to be almost tripled. It then far outshone\r\nRigel in Orion, and on the 2nd of January following it very nearly\r\nmatched Alpha Centauri. From that date it declined; but a second\r\nand even brighter maximum occurred in April, 1843, when Maclear, then\r\ndirector of the Cape Observatory, saw it blaze out with a splendour\r\napproaching that of Sirius. Its waxings and wanings were marked by\r\ncurious \"trepidations\" of brightness extremely perplexing to theory. In\r\n1863 it had sunk below the fifth magnitude, and in 1869 was barely\r\nvisible to the naked eye; yet it was not until eighteen years later that\r\nit touched a minimum of 7·6 magnitude. Soon afterwards a recovery of\r\nbrightness set in, but was not carried very far; and the star now shines\r\nsteadily as of the seventh magnitude, its reddish light contrasting\r\neffectively with the silvery rays of the surrounding nebula. An attempt\r\nto include its fluctuations within a cycle of seventy years[125] has\r\nsignally failed; the extent and character of the vicissitudes to which\r\nit is subject stamping it rather as a species of connecting link between\r\nperiodic and temporary stars.[126]\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous topics which engaged Herschel's attention at the Cape\r\nwas that of relative stellar brightness. Having contrived an\r\n\"astrometer\" in which an \"artificial star,\" formed by the total\r\nreflection of moonlight from the base of a prism, served as a standard\r\nof comparison, he was able to estimate the lustre of the _natural_ stars\r\nexamined by the distances at which the artificial object appeared equal\r\nrespectively to each. He thus constructed a table of 191 of the\r\nprincipal stars,[127] both in the northern and southern hemispheres,\r\nsetting forth the numerical values of their apparent brightness\r\nrelatively to that of Alpha Centauri, which he selected as a unit\r\nof measurement. Further, the light of the full moon being found by him\r\nto exceed that of his standard star 27,408 times, and Dr. Wollaston\r\nhaving shown that the light of the full moon is to that of the sun as\r\n1:801,072[128] (Zöllner made the ratio 1:618,000), it became possible to\r\ncompare stellar with solar radiance. Hence was derived, in the case of\r\nthe few stars at ascertained distances, a knowledge of real lustre.\r\nAlpha Centauri, for example, emits less than twice, Capella one hundred\r\ntimes as much light as our sun; while Arcturus, at its enormous\r\ndistance, must display the splendour of 1,300 such luminaries.\r\n\r\nHerschel returned to England in the spring of 1838, bringing with him a\r\nwealth of observation and discovery such as had perhaps never before\r\nbeen amassed in so short a time. Deserved honours awaited him. He was\r\ncreated a baronet on the occasion of the Queen's coronation (he had been\r\nknighted in 1831); universities and learned societies vied with each\r\nother in showering distinctions upon him; and the success of an\r\nenterprise in which scientific zeal was tinctured with an attractive\r\nflavour of adventurous romance, was justly regarded as a matter of\r\nnational pride. His career as an observing astronomer was now virtually\r\nclosed, and he devoted his leisure to the collection and arrangement of\r\nthe abundant trophies of his father's and his own activity. The\r\nresulting great catalogue of 5,079 nebulæ (including all then certainly\r\nknown), published in the _Philosophical Transactions_ for 1864, is, and\r\nwill probably long remain, the fundamental source of information on the\r\nsubject;[129] but he unfortunately did not live to finish the companion\r\nwork on double stars, for which he had accumulated a vast store of\r\nmaterials.[130] He died at Collingwood in Kent, May 11, 1871, in the\r\neightieth year of his age, and was buried in Westminster Abbey, close\r\nbeside the grave of Sir Isaac Newton.\r\n\r\nThe consideration of Sir John Herschel's Cape observations brings us to\r\nthe close of the period we are just now engaged in studying. They were\r\ngiven to the world, as already stated, three years before the middle of\r\nthe century, and accurately represent the condition of sidereal science\r\nat that date. Looking back over the fifty years traversed, we can see at\r\na glance how great was the stride made in the interval. Not alone was\r\nacquaintance with individual members of the cosmos vastly extended, but\r\ntheir mutual relations, the laws governing their movements, their\r\ndistances from the earth, masses, and intrinsic lustre, had begun to be\r\nsuccessfully investigated. _Begun to be_; for only regarding a scarcely\r\nperceptible minority had even approximate conclusions been arrived at.\r\nNevertheless the whole progress of the future lay in that beginning; it\r\nwas the thin end of the wedge of exact knowledge. The principle of\r\nmeasurement had been substituted for that of probability; a basis had\r\nbeen found large and strong enough to enable calculation to ascend from\r\nit to the sidereal heavens; and refinements had been introduced,\r\nfruitful in performance, but still more in promise. Thus, rather the\r\nkind than the amount of information collected was significant for the\r\ntime to come--rather the methods employed than the results actually\r\nsecured rendered the first half of the nineteenth century of epochal\r\nimportance in the history of our knowledge of the stars.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: Bessel, _Populäre Vorlesungen_, pp. 6, 408.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: Fitted to the old transit instrument, July 11, 1772.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: _Briefwechsel mit Olbers_, p. xvi.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: R.

The seeming irregularity of\r\nthe phenomena discouraged continuous attention; casual observations were\r\nmade the basis of arbitrary conjectures, and real knowledge received\r\nlittle or no increase. In 1620 we find Jean Tarde, Canon of Sarlat,\r\narguing that because the sun is \"the eye of the world,\" and the eye of\r\nthe world _cannot suffer from ophthalmia_, therefore the appearances in\r\nquestion must be due, not to actual specks or stains on the bright solar\r\ndisc, but to the transits of a number of small planets across it! To\r\nthis new group of heavenly bodies he gave the name of \"Borbonia Sidera,\"\r\nand they were claimed in 1633 for the House of Hapsburg, under the title\r\nof \"Austriaca Sidera\" by Father Malapertius, a Belgian Jesuit.[131] A\r\nsimilar view was temporarily maintained against Galileo by the justly\r\ncelebrated Father Scheiner of Ingolstadt, and later by William\r\nGascoigne, the inventor of the micrometer; but most of those who were\r\ncapable of thinking at all on such subjects (and they were but few)\r\nadhered either to the _cloud theory_ or to the _slag theory_ of\r\nsun-spots. The first was championed by Galileo, the second by Simon\r\nMarius, \"astronomer and physician\" to the brother Margraves of\r\nBrandenburg. The latter opinion received a further notable development\r\nfrom the fact that in 1618, a year remarkable for the appearance of\r\nthree bright comets, the sun was almost free from spots; whence it was\r\ninferred that the cindery refuse from the great solar conflagration,\r\nwhich usually appeared as dark blotches on its surface, was occasionally\r\nthrown off in the form of comets, leaving the sun, like a snuffed taper,\r\nto blaze with renewed brilliancy.[132]\r\n\r\nIn the following century, Derham gathered from observations carried on\r\nduring the years 1703-11, \"That the spots on the sun are caused by the\r\neruption of some new volcano therein, which at first pouring out a\r\nprodigious quantity of smoke and other opacous matter, causeth the\r\nspots; and as that fuliginous matter decayeth and spendeth itself, and\r\nthe volcano at last becomes more torrid and flaming, so the spots decay,\r\nand grow to umbræ, and at last to faculæ.\"[133]\r\n\r\nThe view, confidently upheld by Lalande,[134] that spots were rocky\r\nelevations uncovered by the casual ebbing of a luminous ocean, the\r\nsurrounding penumbræ representing shoals or sandbanks, had even less to\r\nrecommend it than Derham's volcanic theory. Both were, however,\r\nsignificant of a growing tendency to bring solar phenomena within the\r\ncompass of terrestrial analogies.\r\n\r\nFor 164 years, then, after Galileo first levelled his telescope at the\r\nsetting sun, next to nothing was learned as to its nature; and the facts\r\nimmediately ascertained, of its rotation on an axis nearly erect to the\r\nplane of the ecliptic, in a period of between twenty-five and twenty-six\r\ndays, and of the virtual limitation of the spots to a so-called \"royal\"\r\nzone extending some thirty degrees north and south of the solar equator,\r\ngained little either in precision or development from five generations\r\nof astronomers.\r\n\r\nBut in November, 1769, a spot of extraordinary size engaged the\r\nattention of Alexander Wilson, professor of astronomy in the University\r\nof Glasgow. He watched it day by day, and to good purpose. As the great\r\nglobe slowly revolved, carrying the spot towards its western edge, he\r\nwas struck with the gradual contraction and final disappearance of the\r\npenumbra _on the side next the centre of the disc_; and when on the 6th\r\nof December the same spot re-emerged on the eastern limb, he perceived,\r\nas he had anticipated, that the shady zone was now deficient _on the\r\nopposite side_, and resumed its original completeness as it returned to\r\na central position. In other spots subsequently examined by him, similar\r\nperspective effects were visible, and he proved in 1774,[135] by strict\r\ngeometrical reasoning, that they could only arise in vast photospheric\r\nexcavations. It was not, indeed, the first time that such a view had\r\nbeen suggested. Father Scheiner's later observations plainly\r\nforeshadowed it;[136] a conjecture to the same effect was emitted by\r\nLeonard Rost of Nuremburg early in the eighteenth century;[137] both by\r\nLahire in 1703 and by J. Cassini in 1719 spots had been seen as notches\r\non the solar limb; while in 1770 Pastor Schülen of Essingen, from the\r\ncareful study of phenomena similar to those noted by Wilson, concluded\r\ntheir depressed nature.[138] Modern observations, nevertheless, prove\r\nthose phenomena to be by no means universally present.\r\n\r\nWilson's general theory of the sun was avowedly tentative. It took the\r\nmodest form of an interrogatory. \"Is it not reasonable to think,\" he\r\nasks, \"that the great and stupendous body of the sun is made up of two\r\nkinds of matter, very different in their qualities; that by far the\r\ngreater part is solid and dark, and that this immense and dark globe is\r\nencompassed with a thin covering of that resplendent substance from\r\nwhich the sun would seem to derive the whole of his vivifying heat and\r\nenergy?\"[139] He further suggests that the excavations or spots may be\r\noccasioned \"by the working of some sort of elastic vapour which is\r\ngenerated within the dark globe,\" and that the luminous matter, being in\r\nsome degree fluid, and being acted upon by gravity, tends to flow down\r\nand cover the nucleus. From these hints, supplemented by his own\r\ndiligent observations and sagacious reasonings, Herschel elaborated a\r\nscheme of solar constitution which held its ground until the physics of\r\nthe sun were revolutionised by the spectroscope.\r\n\r\nA cool, dark, solid globe, its surface diversified with mountains and\r\nvalleys, clothed in luxuriant vegetation, and \"richly stored with\r\ninhabitants,\" protected by a heavy cloud-canopy from the intolerable\r\nglare of the upper luminous region, where the dazzling coruscations of a\r\nsolar aurora some thousands of miles in depth evolved the stores of\r\nlight and heat which vivify our world--such was the central luminary\r\nwhich Herschel constructed with his wonted ingenuity, and described with\r\nhis wonted eloquence.\r\n\r\n\"This way of considering the sun and its atmosphere,\" he says,[140]\r\n\"removes the great dissimilarity we have hitherto been used to find\r\nbetween its condition and that of the rest of the great bodies of the\r\nsolar system. The sun, viewed in this light, appears to be nothing else\r\nthan a very eminent, large, and lucid planet, evidently the first, or,\r\nin strictness of speaking, the only primary one of our system; all\r\nothers being truly secondary to it. Its similarity to the other globes\r\nof the solar system with regard to its solidity, its atmosphere, and its\r\ndiversified surface, the rotation upon its axis, and the fall of heavy\r\nbodies, leads us on to suppose that it is most probably also inhabited,\r\nlike the rest of the planets, by beings whose organs are adapted to the\r\npeculiar circumstances of that vast globe.\"\r\n\r\nWe smile at conclusions which our present knowledge condemns as\r\nextravagant and impossible, but such incidental flights of fancy in no\r\nway derogate from the high value of Herschel's contributions to solar\r\nscience. The cloud-like character which he attributed to the radiant\r\nshell of the sun (first named by Schröter the \"photosphere\") is borne\r\nout by all recent investigations; he observed its mottled or corrugated\r\naspect, resembling, as he described it, the roughness on the rind of an\r\norange; showed that \"faculæ\" are elevations or heaped-up ridges of the\r\ndisturbed photospheric matter; and threw out the idea that spots may\r\nensue from an excess of the ordinary luminous emissions. A certain\r\n\"empyreal\" gas was, he supposed (very much as Wilson had done),\r\ngenerated in the body of the sun, and rising everywhere by reason of its\r\nlightness, made for itself, when in moderate quantities, small openings\r\nor \"pores,\"[141] abundantly visible as dark points on the solar disc.\r\nBut should an uncommon quantity be formed, \"it will,\" he maintained,\r\n\"burst through the planetary[142] regions of clouds, and thus will\r\nproduce great openings; then, spreading itself above them, it will\r\noccasion large shallows (penumbræ), and mixing afterwards gradually with\r\nother superior gases, it will promote the increase, and assist in the\r\nmaintenance, of the general luminous phenomena.\"[143]\r\n\r\nThis partial anticipation of the modern view that the solar radiations\r\nare maintained by some process of circulation within the solar mass, was\r\nreached by Herschel through prolonged study of the phenomena in\r\nquestion. The novel and important idea contained in it, however, it was\r\nat that time premature to attempt to develop. But though many of the\r\nsubtler suggestions of Herschel's genius passed unnoticed by his\r\ncontemporaries, the main result of his solar researches was an\r\nunmistakable one. It was nothing less than the definitive introduction\r\ninto astronomy of the paradoxical conception of the central fire and\r\nhearth of our system as a cold, dark, terrestrial mass, wrapt in a\r\nmantle of innocuous radiance--an earth, so to speak, within--a sun\r\nwithout.\r\n\r\nLet us pause for a moment to consider the value of this remarkable\r\ninnovation. It certainly was not a step in the direction of truth. On\r\nthe contrary, the crude notions of Anaxagoras and Xeno approached more\r\nnearly to what we now know of the sun, than the complicated structure\r\ndevised for the happiness of a nobler race of beings than our own by the\r\nbenevolence of eighteenth-century astronomers. And yet it undoubtedly\r\nconstituted a very important advance in science. It was the first\r\nearnest attempt to bring solar phenomena within the compass of a\r\nrational system; to put together into a consistent whole the facts\r\nascertained; to fabricate, in short, a solar machine that would in some\r\nfashion work. It is true that the materials were inadequate and the\r\ndesign faulty. The resulting construction has not proved strong enough\r\nto stand the wear and tear of time and discovery, but has had to be\r\ntaken to pieces and remodelled on a totally different plan. But the work\r\nwas not therefore done in vain. None of Bacon's aphorisms show a clearer\r\ninsight into the relations between the human mind and the external world\r\nthan that which declares \"Truth to emerge sooner from error than from\r\nconfusion.\"[144] A definite theory (even if a false one) gives\r\nholding-ground to thought. Facts acquire a meaning with reference to it.\r\nIt affords a motive for accumulating them and a means of co-ordinating\r\nthem; it provides a framework for their arrangement, and a receptacle\r\nfor their preservation, until they become too strong and numerous to be\r\nany longer included within arbitrary limits, and shatter the vessel\r\noriginally framed to contain them.\r\n\r\nSuch was the purpose subserved by Herschel's theory of the sun. It\r\nhelped to _clarify_ ideas on the subject. The turbid sense of groping\r\nand viewless ignorance gave place to the lucidity of a possible scheme.\r\nThe persuasion of knowledge is a keen incentive to its increase. Few men\r\ncare to investigate what they are obliged to admit themselves entirely\r\nignorant of; but once started on the road of knowledge, real or\r\nsupposed, they are eager to pursue it. By the promulgation of a\r\nconfident and consistent view regarding the nature of the sun,\r\naccordingly, research was encouraged, because it was rendered hopeful,\r\nand inquirers were shown a path leading indefinitely onwards where an\r\nimpassable thicket had before seemed to bar the way.\r\n\r\nWe have called the \"terrestrial\" theory of the sun's nature an\r\ninnovation, and so, as far as its general acceptance is concerned, it\r\nmay justly be termed; but, like all successful innovations, it was a\r\nlong time brewing. It is extremely curious to find that Herschel had a\r\npredecessor in its advocacy who never looked through a telescope (nor,\r\nindeed, imagined the possibility of such an instrument), who knew\r\nnothing of sun-spots, was still (mistaken assertions to the contrary\r\nnotwithstanding) in the bondage of the geocentric system, and regarded\r\nnature from the lofty standpoint of an idealist philosophy. This was the\r\nlearned and enlightened Cardinal Cusa, a fisherman's son from the banks\r\nof the Moselle, whose distinguished career in the Church and in\r\nliterature extended over a considerable part of the fifteenth century\r\n(1401-64). In his singular treatise _De Doctâ Ignorantiâ_, one of the\r\nmost notable literary monuments of the early Renaissance, the following\r\npassage occurs:--\"To a spectator on the surface of the sun, the\r\nsplendour which appears to us would be invisible, since it contains, as\r\nit were, an earth for its central mass, with a circumferential envelope\r\nof light and heat, and between the two an atmosphere of water and clouds\r\nand translucent air.\" The luminary of Herschel's fancy could scarcely be\r\nmore clearly portrayed; some added words, however, betray the origin of\r\nthe Cardinal's idea. \"The earth also,\" he says, \"would appear as a\r\nshining star to any one outside the fiery element.\" It was, in fact, an\r\nextension to the sun of the ancient elemental doctrine; but an extension\r\nremarkable at that period, as premonitory of the tendency, so powerfully\r\ndeveloped by subsequent discoveries, to assimilate the orbs of heaven to\r\nthe model of our insignificant planet, and to extend the brotherhood of\r\nour system and our species to the farthest limit of the visible or\r\nimaginable universe.\r\n\r\nIn later times we find Flamsteed communicating to Newton, March 7, 1681,\r\nhis opinion \"that the substance of the sun is terrestrial matter, his\r\nlight but the liquid menstruum encompassing him.\"[145] Bode in 1776\r\narrived independently at the conclusion that \"the sun is neither burning\r\nnor glowing, but in its essence a dark planetary body, composed like our\r\nearth of land and water, varied by mountains and valleys, and enveloped\r\nin a vaporous atmosphere\";[146] and the learned in general applauded and\r\nacquiesced. The view, however, was in 1787 still so far from popular,\r\nthat the holding of it was alleged as a proof of insanity in Dr. Elliot\r\nwhen accused of a murderous assault on Miss Boydell. His friend Dr.\r\nSimmons stated on his behalf that he had received from him in the\r\npreceding January a letter giving evidence of a deranged mind, wherein\r\nhe asserted \"that the sun is not a body of fire, as hath been hitherto\r\nsupposed, but that its light proceeds from a dense and universal aurora,\r\nwhich may afford ample light to the inhabitants of the surface beneath,\r\nand yet be at such a distance aloft as not to annoy them. No objection,\r\nhe saith, ariseth to that great luminary's being inhabited; vegetation\r\nmay obtain there as well as with us. There may be water and dry land,\r\nhills and dales, rain and fair weather; and as the light, so the season\r\nmust be eternal, consequently it may easily be conceived to be by far\r\nthe most blissful habitation of the whole system!\" The Recorder,\r\nnevertheless, objected that if an extravagant hypothesis were to be\r\nadduced as proof of insanity, the same might hold good with regard to\r\nsome other speculators, and desired Dr. Simmons to tell the court what\r\nhe thought of the theories of Burnet and Buffon.[147]\r\n\r\nEight years later, this same \"extravagant hypothesis,\" backed by the\r\npowerful recommendation of Sir William Herschel, obtained admittance to\r\nthe venerable halls of science, there to abide undisturbed for nearly\r\nseven decades. Individual objectors, it is true, made themselves heard,\r\nbut their arguments had little effect on the general body of opinion.\r\nRuder blows were required to shatter an hypothesis flattering to human\r\npride of invention in its completeness, in the plausible detail of\r\nobservations by which it seemed to be supported, and in its\r\ncondescension to the natural pleasure in discovering resemblance under\r\nall but total dissimilarity.\r\n\r\nSir John Herschel included among the results of his multifarious labours\r\nat the Cape of Good Hope a careful study of the sun-spots conspicuously\r\nvisible towards the end of the year 1836 and in the early part of 1837.\r\nThey were remarkable, he tells us, for their forms and arrangement, as\r\nwell as for their number and size; one group, measured on the 29th of\r\nMarch in the latter year, covering (apart from what may be called its\r\noutlying dependencies) the vast area of five square minutes or 3,780\r\nmillion square miles.[148] We have at present to consider, however, not\r\nso much these observations in themselves, as the chain of theoretical\r\nsuggestions by which they were connected. The distribution of spots, it\r\nwas pointed out, on two zones parallel to the equator, showed plainly\r\ntheir intimate connection with the solar rotation, and indicated as\r\ntheir cause fluid circulations analogous to those producing the\r\nterrestrial trade and anti-trade winds.\r\n\r\n\"The spots, in this view of the subject,\" he went on to say,[149] \"would\r\ncome to be assimilated to those regions on the earth's surface where,\r\nfor the moment, hurricanes and tornadoes prevail; the upper stratum\r\nbeing temporarily carried downwards, displacing by its impetus the two\r\nstrata of luminous matter beneath, the upper of course to a greater\r\nextent than the lower, and thus wholly or partially denuding the opaque\r\nsurface of the sun below. Such processes cannot be unaccompanied by\r\nvorticose motions, which, left to themselves, die away by degrees and\r\ndissipate, with the peculiarity that their lower portions come to rest\r\nmore speedily than their upper, by reason of the greater resistance\r\nbelow, as well as the remoteness from the point of action, which lies in\r\na higher region, so that their centres (as seen in our waterspouts,\r\nwhich are nothing but small tornadoes) appear to retreat upwards. Now\r\nthis agrees perfectly with what is observed during the obliteration of\r\nthe solar spots, which appear as if filled in by the collapse of their\r\nsides, the penumbra closing in upon the spot and disappearing after it.\"\r\n\r\nBut when it comes to be asked whether a cause can be found by which a\r\ndiversity of solar temperature might be produced corresponding with that\r\nwhich sets the currents of the terrestrial atmosphere in motion, we are\r\nforced to reply that we know of no such cause. For Sir John Herschel's\r\nhypothesis of an increased retention of heat at the sun's equator, due\r\nto the slightly spheroidal or bulging form of its outer atmospheric\r\nenvelope, assuredly gives no sufficient account of such circulatory\r\nmovements as he supposed to exist. Nevertheless, the view that the sun's\r\nrotation is intimately connected with the formation of spots is so\r\nobviously correct, that we can only wonder it was not thought of sooner,\r\nwhile we are even now unable to explain with any certainty _how_ it is\r\nso connected.\r\n\r\nMere scrutiny of the solar surface, however, is not the only means of\r\nsolar observation. We have a satellite, and that satellite from time to\r\ntime acts most opportunely as a screen, cutting off a part or the whole\r\nof those dazzling rays in which the master-orb of our system veils\r\nhimself from over-curious regards. The importance of eclipses to the\r\nstudy of the solar surroundings is of comparatively recent recognition;\r\nnevertheless, much of what we know concerning them has been snatched, as\r\nit were, by surprise under favour of the moon. In former times, the sole\r\nastronomical use of such incidents was the correction of the received\r\ntheories of the solar and lunar movements; the precise time of their\r\noccurrence was the main fact to be noted, and subsidiary phenomena\r\nreceived but casual attention. Now, their significance as a geometrical\r\ntest of tabular accuracy is altogether overshadowed by the interest\r\nattaching to the physical observations for which they afford propitious\r\noccasions. This change may be said to date, in its pronounced form, from\r\nthe great eclipse of 1842. Although a necessary consequence of the\r\ngeneral direction taken by scientific progress, it remains associated in\r\na special manner with the name of Francis Baily.\r\n\r\nThe \"philosopher of Newbury\" was by profession a London stockbroker, and\r\na highly successful one. Nevertheless, his services to science were\r\nnumerous and invaluable, though not of the brilliant kind which attract\r\npopular notice. Born at Newbury in Berkshire, April 28, 1774, and placed\r\nin the City at the age of fourteen, he derived from the acquaintance of\r\nDr. Priestley a love of science which never afterwards left him. It was,\r\nhowever, no passion such as flames up in the brain of the destined\r\ndiscoverer, but a regulated inclination, kept well within the bounds of\r\nan actively pursued commercial career. After travelling for a year or\r\ntwo in what were then the wilds of North America, he went on the Stock\r\nExchange in 1799, and earned during twenty-four years of assiduous\r\napplication to affairs a high reputation for integrity and ability, to\r\nwhich corresponded an ample fortune. In the meantime the Astronomical\r\nSociety (largely through his co-operation) had been founded; he had for\r\nthree years acted as its secretary, and he now felt entitled to devote\r\nhimself exclusively to a subject which had long occupied his leisure\r\nhours. He accordingly in 1825 retired from business, purchased a house\r\nin Tavistock Place, and fitted up there a small observatory. He was,\r\nhowever, by preference a computator rather than an observer. What Sir\r\nJohn Herschel calls the \"archæology of practical astronomy\" found in him\r\nan especially zealous student. He re-edited the star-catalogues of\r\nPtolemy, Ulugh Beigh, Tycho Brahe, Hevelius, Halley, Flamsteed,\r\nLacaille, and Mayer; calculated the eclipse of Thales and the eclipse of\r\nAgathocles, and vindicated the memory of the first Astronomer Royal. But\r\nhe was no less active in meeting present needs than in revising past\r\nperformances. The subject of the reduction of observations, then, as we\r\nhave already explained,[150] in a state of deplorable confusion,\r\nattracted his most earnest attention, and he was close on the track of\r\nBessel when made acquainted with the method of simplification devised at\r\nKönigsberg. Anticipated as an inventor, he could still be of eminent use\r\nas a promoter of these valuable improvements; and, carrying them out on\r\na large scale in the star-catalogue of the Astronomical Society\r\n(published in 1827), \"he put\" (in the words of Herschel) \"the\r\nastronomical world in possession of a power which may be said, without\r\nexaggeration, to have changed the face of sidereal astronomy.\"[151]\r\n\r\nHis reputation was still further enhanced by his renewal, with vastly\r\nimproved apparatus, of the method, first used by Henry Cavendish in\r\n1797-98, for determining the density of the earth. From a series of no\r\nless than 2,153 delicate and difficult experiments, conducted at\r\nTavistock Place during the years 1838-42, he concluded our planet to\r\nweigh 5·66 as much as a globe of water of the same bulk; and this result\r\nslightly corrected is still accepted as a very close approximation of\r\nthe truth.\r\n\r\nWhat we have thus glanced at is but a fragment of the truly surprising\r\nmass of work accomplished by Baily in the course of a variously occupied\r\nlife. A rare combination of qualities fitted him for his task. Unvarying\r\nhealth, undisturbed equanimity, methodical habits, the power of directed\r\nand sustained thought, combined to form in him an intellectual toiler of\r\nthe surest, though not perhaps of the highest quality. He was in harness\r\nalmost to the end. He was destined scarcely to know the miseries of\r\nenforced idleness or of consciously failing powers. In 1842 he completed\r\nthe laborious reduction of Lalande's great catalogue, undertaken at the\r\nrequest of the British Association, and was still engaged in seeing it\r\nthrough the press when he was attacked with what proved his last, as it\r\nwas probably his first serious illness. He, however, recovered\r\nsufficiently to attend the Oxford Commemoration of July 2, 1844, where\r\nan honorary degree of D.C.L. was conferred upon him in company with Airy\r\nand Struve; but sank rapidly after the effort, and died on the 30th of\r\nAugust following, at the age of seventy, lamented and esteemed by all\r\nwho knew him.\r\n\r\nIt is now time to consider his share in the promotion of solar research.\r\nEclipses of the sun, both ancient and modern, were a speciality with\r\nhim, and he was fortunate in those which came under his observation.\r\nSuch phenomena are of three kinds--partial, annular, and total. In a\r\npartial eclipse, the moon, instead of passing directly between us and\r\nthe sun, slips by, as it were, a little on one side, thus cutting off\r\nfrom our sight only a portion of his surface. An annular eclipse, on the\r\nother hand, takes place when the moon is indeed centrally interposed,\r\nbut falls short of the apparent size required for the entire concealment\r\nof the solar disc, which consequently remains visible as a bright ring\r\nor annulus, even when the obscuration is at its height. In a total\r\neclipse, on the contrary, the sun completely disappears behind the dark\r\nbody of the moon. The difference of the two latter varieties is due to\r\nthe fact that the apparent diameter of the sun and moon are so nearly\r\nequal as to gain alternate preponderance one over the other through the\r\nslight periodical changes in their respective distances from the earth.\r\n\r\nNow, on the 15th of May, 1836, an annular eclipse was visible in the\r\nnorthern parts of Great Britain, and was observed by Baily at Inch\r\nBonney, near Jedburgh. It was here that he saw the phenomenon which\r\nobtained the name of \"Baily's Beads,\" from the notoriety conferred upon\r\nit by his vivid description.\r\n\r\n\"When the cusps of the sun,\" he writes, \"were about 40° asunder, a row\r\nof lucid points, like a string of bright beads, irregular in size and\r\ndistance from each other, _suddenly_ formed round that part of the\r\ncircumference of the moon that was about to enter on the sun's disc. Its\r\nformation, indeed, was so rapid that it presented the appearance of\r\nhaving been caused by the ignition of a fine train of gunpowder.\r\nFinally, as the moon pursued her course, the dark intervening spaces\r\n(which, at their origin, had the appearance of lunar mountains in high\r\nrelief, and which still continued attached to the sun's border) were\r\nstretched out into long, black, thick, parallel lines, joining the limbs\r\nof the sun and moon; when all at once they _suddenly_ gave way, and left\r\nthe circumference of the sun and moon in those points, as in the rest,\r\ncomparatively smooth and circular, and the moon perceptibly advanced on\r\nthe face of the sun.\"[152]\r\n\r\nThese curious appearances were not an absolute novelty. Weber in 1791,\r\nand Von Zach in 1820, had seen the \"beads\"; Van Swinden had described\r\nthe \"belts\" or \"threads.\"[153] These last were, moreover (as Baily\r\nclearly perceived), completely analogous to the \"black ligament\" which\r\nformed so troublesome a feature in the transits of Venus in 1764 and\r\n1769, and which, to the regret and confusion, though no longer to the\r\nsurprise of observers, was renewed in that of 1874. The phenomenon is\r\nlargely an effect of what is called _irradiation_, by which a bright\r\nobject seems to encroach upon a dark one; but under good atmospheric and\r\ninstrumental conditions it becomes inconspicuous. The \"Beads\" must\r\nalways appear when the projected lunar edge is serrated with mountains.\r\nIn Baily's observation, they were exaggerated and distorted by an\r\nirradiative _clinging together_ of the limbs of sun and moon.\r\n\r\nThe immediate result, however, was powerfully to stimulate attention to\r\nsolar eclipses in their _physical_ aspect. Never before had an\r\noccurrence of the kind been expected so eagerly or prepared for so\r\nactively as that which was total over Central and Southern Europe on the\r\n8th of July, 1842. Astronomers hastened from all quarters to the\r\nfavoured region. The Astronomer Royal (Airy) repaired to Turin; Baily to\r\nPavia; Otto Struve threw aside his work amidst the stars at Pulkowa, and\r\nwent south as far as Lipeszk; Schumacher travelled from Altona to\r\nVienna; Arago from Paris to Perpignan. Nor did their trouble go\r\nunrewarded. The expectations of the most sanguine were outdone by the\r\nwonders disclosed.\r\n\r\nBaily (to whose narrative we again have recourse) had set up his\r\nDollond's achromatic in an upper room of the University of Pavia, and\r\nwas eagerly engaged in noting a partial repetition of the singular\r\nappearances seen by him in 1836, when he was \"astounded by a tremendous\r\nburst of applause from the streets below, and at the same moment was\r\nelectrified at the sight of one of the most brilliant and splendid\r\nphenomena that can well be imagined. For at that instant the dark body\r\nof the moon was suddenly surrounded with a corona, or kind of bright\r\nglory similar in shape and relative magnitude to that which painters\r\ndraw round the heads of saints, and which by the French is designated an\r\n_auréole_. Pavia contains many thousand inhabitants, the major part of\r\nwhom were, at this early hour, walking about the streets and squares or\r\nlooking out of windows, in order to witness this long-talked-of\r\nphenomenon; and when the total obscuration took place, which was\r\n_instantaneous_, there was a universal shout from every observer, which\r\n'made the welkin ring,' and, for the moment, withdrew my attention from\r\nthe object with which I was immediately occupied. I had indeed\r\nanticipated the appearance of a luminous circle round the moon during\r\nthe time of total obscurity; but I did not expect, from any of the\r\naccounts of preceding eclipses that I had read, to witness so\r\nmagnificent an exhibition as that which took place.... The breadth of\r\nthe corona, measured from the circumference of the moon, appeared to me\r\nto be nearly equal to half the moon's diameter. It had the appearance of\r\nbrilliant rays. The light was most dense close to the border of the\r\nmoon, and became gradually and uniformly more attenuate as its distance\r\ntherefrom increased, assuming the form of diverging rays in a\r\nrectilinear line, which at the extremity were more divided, and of an\r\nunequal length; so that in no part of the corona could I discover the\r\nregular and well-defined shape of a ring at its _outer_ margin. It\r\nappeared to me to have the sun for its centre, but I had no means of\r\ntaking any accurate measures for determining this point. Its colour was\r\nquite white, not pearl-colour, nor yellow, nor red, and the rays had a\r\nvivid and flickering appearance, somewhat like that which a gaslight\r\nillumination might be supposed to assume if formed into a similar\r\nshape.... Splendid and astonishing, however, as this remarkable\r\nphenomenon really was, and although it could not fail to call forth the\r\nadmiration and applause of every beholder, yet I must confess that there\r\nwas at the same time something in its singular and wonderful appearance\r\nthat was appalling; and I can readily imagine that uncivilised nations\r\nmay occasionally have become alarmed and terrified at such an object,\r\nmore especially at times when the true cause of the occurrence may have\r\nbeen but faintly understood, and the phenomenon itself wholly\r\nunexpected.\r\n\r\n\"But the most remarkable circumstance attending the phenomenon was the\r\nappearance of _three large protuberances_ apparently emanating from the\r\ncircumference of the moon, but evidently forming a portion of the\r\ncorona. They had the appearance of mountains of a prodigious elevation;\r\ntheir colour was red, tinged with lilac or purple; perhaps the colour of\r\nthe peach-blossom would more nearly represent it. They somewhat\r\nresembled the snowy tops of the Alpine mountains when coloured by the\r\nrising or setting sun. They resembled the Alpine mountains also in\r\nanother respect, inasmuch as their light was perfectly steady, and had\r\nnone of that flickering or sparkling motion so visible in other parts of\r\nthe corona. All the three projections were of the same roseate cast of\r\ncolour, and very different from the brilliant vivid white light that\r\nformed the corona; but they differed from each other in magnitude....\r\nThe whole of these three protuberances were visible even to the last\r\nmoment of total obscuration; at least, I never lost sight of them when\r\nlooking in that direction; and when the first ray of light was admitted\r\nfrom the sun, they vanished, with the corona, altogether, and daylight\r\nwas instantaneously restored.\"[154]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding unfavourable weather, the \"red flames\" were perceived\r\nwith little less clearness and no less amazement from the Superga than\r\nat Pavia, and were even discerned by Mr. Airy with the naked eye. \"Their\r\nform\" (the Astronomer Royal wrote) \"was nearly that of saw-teeth in the\r\nposition proper for a circular saw turned round in the same direction in\r\nwhich the hands of a watch turn.... Their colour was a full lake-red,\r\nand their brilliancy greater than that of any other part of the\r\nring.\"[155]\r\n\r\nThe height of these extraordinary objects was estimated by Arago at two\r\nminutes of arc, representing, at the sun's distance, an actual elevation\r\nof 54,000 miles. When carefully watched, the rose-flush of their\r\nillumination was perceived to fade through violet to white as the light\r\nreturned, the same changes in a reversed order having accompanied their\r\nfirst appearance. Their forms, however, during about three minutes of\r\nvisibility, showed no change, although of so apparently unstable a\r\ncharacter as to suggest to Arago \"mountains on the point of crumbling\r\ninto ruins\" through topheaviness.[156]\r\n\r\nThe corona, both as to figure and extent, presented very different\r\nappearances at different stations. This was no doubt due to varieties in\r\natmospheric conditions. At the Superga, for instance, all details of\r\nstructure seem to have been effaced by the murky air, only a\r\ncomparatively feeble ring of light being seen to encircle the moon.\r\nElsewhere, a brilliant radiated formation was conspicuous, spreading at\r\nfour opposite points into four vast luminous expansions, compared to\r\nfeather-plumes or _aigrettes_.[157] Arago at Perpignan noticed\r\nconsiderable irregularities in the divergent rays. Some appeared curved\r\nand twisted, a few lay _across_ the others, in a direction almost\r\ntangential to the moon's limb, the general effect being described as\r\nthat of a \"hank of thread in disorder.\"[158] At Lipeszk, where the sun\r\nstood much higher above the horizon than in Italy or France, the corona\r\nshowed with surprising splendour. Its apparent extent was judged by\r\nStruve to be no less than twenty-five minutes (more than six times\r\nAiry's estimate), while the great plumes spread their radiance to three\r\nor four degrees from the dark lunar edge. So dazzling was the light that\r\nmany well-instructed persons denied the totality of the eclipse. Nor was\r\nthe error without precedent, although the appearances attending\r\nrespectively a total and an annular eclipse are in reality wholly\r\ndissimilar. In the latter case, the surviving ring of sunlight becomes\r\nso much enlarged by irradiation, that the interposed dark lunar body is\r\nreduced to comparative insignificance, or even invisibility. Maclaurin\r\ntells us[159] that during an eclipse of this character which he observed\r\nat Edinburgh in 1737, \"gentlemen by no means shortsighted declared\r\nthemselves unable to discern the moon upon the sun without the aid of a\r\nsmoked glass;\" and Baily (who, however, _was_ shortsighted) could\r\ndistinguish, in 1836, with the naked eye, no trace of \"the globe of\r\npurple velvet\" which the telescope revealed as projected upon the face\r\nof the sun.[160] Moreover, the diminution of light is described by him\r\nas \"little more than might be caused by a temporary cloud passing over\r\nthe sun\"; the birds continued in full song, and \"one cock in particular\r\nwas crowing with all his might while the annulus was forming.\"\r\n\r\nVery different were the effects of the eclipse of 1842, as to which some\r\ninteresting particulars were collected by Arago.[161] Beasts of burthen,\r\nhe tells us, paused in their labour, and could by no amount of\r\npunishment be induced to move until the sun reappeared. Birds and beasts\r\nabandoned their food; linnets were found dead in their cages; even ants\r\nsuspended their toil. Diligence-horses, on the other hand, seemed as\r\ninsensible to the phenomenon as locomotives. The convolvulus and some\r\nother plants closed their leaves, but those of the mimosa remained open.\r\nThe little light that remained was of a livid hue. One observer\r\ndescribed the general coloration as resembling the lees of wine, but\r\nhuman faces showed pale olive or greenish. We may, then, rest assured\r\nthat none of the remarkable obscurations recorded in history were due to\r\neclipses of the annular kind.\r\n\r\nThe existence of the corona is no modern discovery. Indeed, it is too\r\nconspicuous an apparition to escape notice from the least attentive or\r\nleast practised observer of a total eclipse. Nevertheless, explicit\r\nreferences to it are rare in early times. Plutarch, however, speaks of a\r\n\"certain splendour\" compassing round the hidden edge of the sun, as a\r\nregular feature of total eclipses;[162] and the corona is expressly\r\nmentioned in a description of an eclipse visible at Corfu in 968\r\nA.D.[163] The first to take the phenomenon into scientific consideration\r\nwas Kepler. He showed, from the orbital positions at the time of the sun\r\nand moon, that an eclipse observed by Clavius at Rome in 1567 could not\r\nhave been annular,[164] as the dazzling coronal radiance visible during\r\nthe obscuration had caused it to be believed. Although he himself never\r\nwitnessed a total eclipse of the sun, he carefully collected and\r\ncompared the remarks of those more fortunate, and concluded that the\r\nring of \"flame-like splendour\" seen on such occasions was caused by the\r\nreflection of the solar rays from matter condensed in the neighbourhood\r\neither of the sun or moon.[165] To the solar explanation he gave his own\r\ndecided preference; but, with one of those curious flashes of\r\nhalf-prophetic insight characteristic of his genius, declared that \"it\r\nshould be laid by ready for use, not brought into immediate\r\nrequisition.\"[166] So literally was his advice acted upon, that the\r\ntheory, which we now know to be (broadly speaking) the correct one, only\r\nemerged from the repository of anticipated truths after 236 years of\r\nalmost complete retirement, and even then timorously and with\r\nhesitation.\r\n\r\nThe first eclipse of which the attendant phenomena were observed with\r\ntolerable exactness was that which was central in the South of France,\r\nMay 12, 1706. Cassini then put forward the view that the \"crown of pale\r\nlight\" seen round the lunar disc was caused by the illumination of the\r\nzodiacal light;[167] but it failed to receive the attention which, as a\r\nstep in the right direction, it undoubtedly merited. Nine years later we\r\nmeet with Halley's comments on a similar event, the first which had\r\noccurred in London since March 20, 1140. By nine in the morning of May\r\n3, 1715, the obscuration, he tells us, \"was about ten digits,[168] when\r\nthe face and colour of the sky began to change from perfect serene azure\r\nblue to a more dusky livid colour, having an eye of purple intermixt....\r\nA few seconds before the sun was all hid, there discovered itself round\r\nthe moon a luminous ring, about a digit or perhaps a tenth part of the\r\nmoon's diameter in breadth. It was of a pale whiteness, or rather pearl\r\ncolour, seeming to be a little tinged with the colours of the iris, and\r\nto be concentric with the moon, whence I concluded it the moon's\r\natmosphere. But the great height thereof, far exceeding our earth's\r\natmosphere, and the observation of some, who found the breadth of the\r\nring to increase on the west side of the moon as emersion approached,\r\ntogether with the contrary sentiments of those whose judgment I shall\r\nalways revere\" (Newton is most probably referred to), \"makes me less\r\nconfident, especially in a matter whereto I confess I gave not all the\r\nattention requisite.\" He concludes by declining to decide whether the\r\n\"enlightened atmosphere,\" which the appearance \"in all respects\r\nresembled,\" \"belonged to sun or moon.\"[169]\r\n\r\nA French Academician, who happened to be in London at the time, was less\r\nguarded in expressing an opinion. The Chevalier de Louville declared\r\nemphatically for the lunar atmospheric theory of the corona,[170] and\r\nhis authority carried great weight. It was, however, much discredited by\r\nan observation made by Maraldi in 1724, to the effect that the luminous\r\nring, instead of travelling _with_ the moon, was traversed _by_ it.[171]\r\nThis was in reality decisive, though, as usual, belief lagged far behind\r\ndemonstration. In 1715 a novel explanation had been offered by Delisle\r\nand Lahire,[172] supported by experiments regarded at the time as\r\nperfectly satisfactory. The aureola round the eclipsed sun, they argued,\r\nis simply a result of the _diffraction_, or apparent bending of the\r\nsunbeams that graze the surface of the lunar globe--an effect of the\r\nsame kind as the coloured fringes of shadows. And this view prevailed\r\namongst men of science until (and even after) Brewster showed, with\r\nclear and simple decisiveness, that such an effect could by no\r\npossibility be appreciable at our distance from the moon.[173] Don José\r\nJoaquim de Ferrer, however, who observed a total eclipse of the sun at\r\nKinderhook, in the State of New York, on June 16, 1806, ignoring this\r\nrefined optical _rationale_, considered two alternative explanations of\r\nthe phenomenon as alone possible. The bright ring round the moon must be\r\ndue to the illumination either of a lunar or of a solar atmosphere. If\r\nthe former, he calculated that it should have a height fifty times that\r\nof the earth's gaseous envelope. \"Such an atmosphere,\" he rightly\r\nconcluded, \"cannot belong to the moon, but must without any doubt belong\r\nto the sun.\"[174] But he stood alone in this unhesitating assertion.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the problem was first brought fully home to\r\nastronomers by the eclipse of 1842. The brilliant and complex appearance\r\nwhich on that occasion challenged the attention of so many observers,\r\ndemanded and received, no longer the casual attention hitherto bestowed\r\nupon it, but the most earnest study of those interested in the progress\r\nof science. Nevertheless, it was only by degrees, and through a process\r\nof \"exclusions\" (to use a Baconian phrase) that the corona was put in\r\nits right place as a solar appendage. As every other available\r\nexplanation proved inadmissible and dropped out of sight, the broad\r\npresentation of fact remained, which, though of sufficiently obvious\r\ninterpretation, was long and persistently misconstrued. Nor was it until\r\n1869 that absolutely decisive evidence on the subject was forthcoming,\r\nas we shall see further on.\r\n\r\nSir John Herschel, writing to his venerable aunt, relates that when the\r\nbrilliant red flames burst into view behind the dark moon on the morning\r\nof the 8th of July, 1842, the populace of Milan, with the usual\r\ninconsequence of a crowd, raised the shout, \"_Es leben die\r\nAstronomen!_\"[175] In reality, none were less prepared for their\r\napparition than the class to whom the applause due to the magnificent\r\nspectacle was thus adjudged. And in some measure through their own\r\nfault, for many partial hints and some distinct statements from earlier\r\nobservers had given unheeded notice that some such phenomenon might be\r\nexpected to attend a solar eclipse.\r\n\r\nWhat we now call the \"chromosphere\" is an envelope of glowing gases, by\r\nwhich the sun is completely covered, and from which the \"prominences\"\r\nare emanations, eruptive or flame-like. Now, continual indications of\r\nthe presence of this fire-ocean had been detected during eclipses in the\r\neighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Captain Stannyan, describing in a\r\nletter to Flamsteed an occurrence of the kind witnessed by him at Berne\r\non May 1 (o.s.), 1706, says that the sun's \"getting out of the eclipse\r\nwas preceded by a blood-red streak of light from its left limb.\"[176] A\r\nprecisely similar appearance was noted by both Halley and De Louville in\r\n1715; during annular eclipses by Lord Aberdour in 1737,[177] and by\r\nShort in 1748,[178] the tint of the ruby border being, however, subdued\r\nto \"brown\" or \"dusky red\" by the surviving sunlight; while observations\r\nidentical in character were made at Amsterdam in 1820,[179] at Edinburgh\r\nby Henderson in 1836, and at New York in 1838.[180]\r\n\r\n\"Flames\" or \"prominences,\" if more conspicuous, are less constant in\r\ntheir presence than the glowing stratum from which they spring. The\r\nfirst to describe them was a Swedish professor named Vassenius, who\r\nobserved a total eclipse at Gothenburg, May 2 (o.s.), 1733.[181] His\r\nastonishment equalled his admiration when he perceived, just outside the\r\nedge of the lunar disc, and suspended, as it seemed, in the coronal\r\natmosphere, three or four reddish spots or clouds, one of which was so\r\nlarge as to be detected with the naked eye. As to their nature, he did\r\nnot even offer a speculation, further than by tacitly referring them to\r\nthe moon. The observation was repeated in 1778 by a Spanish Admiral, but\r\nwith no better success in directing efficacious attention to the\r\nphenomenon. Don Antonio Ulloa was on board his ship the _Espagne_ in\r\npassage from the Azores to Cape St. Vincent on the 24th of June in that\r\nyear, when a total eclipse of the sun occurred, of which he has left a\r\nvaluable description. His notices of the corona are full of interest;\r\nbut what just now concerns us is the appearance of \"a red luminous\r\npoint\" \"near the edge of the moon,\" which gradually increased in size as\r\nthe moon moved away from it, and was visible during about a minute and a\r\nquarter.[182] He was satisfied that it belonged to the sun because of\r\nits fiery colour and growth in magnitude, and supposed that it was\r\noccasioned by some crevice or inequality in the moon's limb, through\r\nwhich the solar light penetrated.\r\n\r\nAllusions less precise, both prior and subsequent, which it is now easy\r\nto refer to similar objects (such as the \"slender columns of smoke\" seen\r\nby Ferrer)[183] might be detailed; but the evidence already adduced\r\nsuffices to show that the prominences viewed with such amazement in 1842\r\nwere no unprecedented or even unusual phenomenon.\r\n\r\nIt was more important, however, to decide what was their nature than\r\nwhether their appearance might have been anticipated. They were\r\ngenerally, and not very incorrectly, set down as solar clouds. Arago\r\nbelieved them to shine by reflected light,[184] but the Abbé Peytal\r\nrightly considered them to be self-luminous. Writing in a Montpellier\r\npaper of July 16, 1842, he declared that we had now become assured of\r\nthe existence of a third or outer solar envelope, composed of a glowing\r\nsubstance of a bright rose tint, forming mountains of prodigious\r\nelevation, analogous in character to the clouds piled above our\r\nhorizons.[185] This first distinct recognition of a very important\r\nfeature of our great luminary was probably founded on an observation\r\nmade by Bérard at Toulon during the then recent eclipse, \"of a very fine\r\nred band, irregularly dentelated, or, as it were, crevassed here and\r\nthere,\"[186] encircling a large arc of the moon's circumference. It can\r\nhardly, however, be said to have attracted general notice until July 28,\r\n1851. On that day a total eclipse took place, which was observed with\r\nconsiderable success in various parts of Sweden and Norway by a number\r\nof English astronomers. Mr. Hind saw, on the south limb of the moon, \"a\r\nlong range of rose-coloured flames,\"[187] described by Dawes as \"a low\r\nridge of red prominences, resembling in outline the tops of a very\r\nirregular range of hills.\"[188] Airy termed the portion of this \"rugged\r\nlines of projections\" visible to him the _sierra_, and was struck with\r\nits brilliant light and \"nearly scarlet\" colour.[189] Its true character\r\nof a continuous solar envelope was inferred from these data by Grant,\r\nSwan, and Littrow, and was by Father Secchi, after the great eclipse of\r\n1860,[190] formally accepted as established.\r\n\r\nSeveral prominences of remarkable forms, especially one variously\r\ncompared to a Turkish scimitar, a sickle, and a boomerang, were seen in\r\n1851. In connection with them two highly significant circumstances were\r\npointed out. First, that of the approximate coincidence between their\r\npositions and those of sun-spots previously observed.[191] Next, that\r\n\"the moon passed over them, leaving them behind, and revealing\r\nsuccessive portions as she advanced.\"[192] This latter perfectly\r\nwell-attested fact was justly considered by the Astronomer Royal and\r\nothers as affording absolute certainty of the solar dependence of these\r\nsingular objects. Nevertheless sceptics were still found. M. Faye, of\r\nthe French Academy, inclined to a lunar origin for them;[193] Feilitsch\r\nof Greifswald published in 1852 a treatise for the express purpose of\r\nproving all the luminous phenomena attendant on solar eclipses--corona,\r\nprominences and \"sierra\"--to be purely optical appearances.[194]\r\nHappily, however, the unanswerable arguments of the photographic camera\r\nwere soon to be made available against such hardy incredulity.\r\n\r\nThus, the virtual discovery of the solar appendages, both coronal and\r\nchromospheric, may be said to have been begun in 1842, and completed in\r\n1851. The current Herschelian theory of the solar constitution remained,\r\nhowever, for the time, intact. Difficulties, indeed, were thickening\r\naround it; but their discussion was perhaps felt to be premature, and\r\nthey were permitted to accumulate without debate, until fortified by\r\nfresh testimony into unexpected and overwhelming preponderance.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 131: Kosmos, Bd. iii., p. 409; Lalande, _Bibliographie\r\nAstronomique_, pp. 179, 202.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 132: R.

The zone in which each planet moved was,\r\naccording to the philosopher of Königsberg, to be regarded as the empty\r\nstorehouse from which its materials had been derived. A definite\r\nrelation should thus exist between the planetary masses and the\r\nplanetary intervals.[196] Lambert, on the other hand, sportively\r\nsuggested that the body or bodies (for it is noticeable that he speaks\r\nof them in the plural) which once bridged this portentous gap in the\r\nsolar system, might, in some remote age, have been swept away by a great\r\ncomet, and forced to attend its wanderings through space.[197]\r\n\r\nThese speculations were destined before long to assume a more definite\r\nform. Johann Daniel Titius, a professor at Wittenberg (where he died in\r\n1796), pointed out in 1772, in a note to a translation of Bonnet's\r\n_Contemplation de la Nature_,[198] the existence of a remarkable\r\nsymmetry in the disposition of the bodies constituting the solar system.\r\nBy a certain series of numbers, increasing in regular progression,[199]\r\nhe showed that the distances of the six known planets from the sun might\r\nbe represented with a close approach to accuracy. But with one striking\r\ninterruption. The term of the series succeeding that which corresponded\r\nto the orbit of Mars was without a celestial representative. The orderly\r\nflow of the sequence was thus singularly broken. The space where a\r\nplanet should--in fulfilment of the \"Law\"--have revolved, was, it\r\nappeared, untenanted. Johann Elert Bode, then just about to begin his\r\nlong career as leader of astronomical thought and work at Berlin, marked\r\nat once the anomaly, and filled the vacant interval with a hypothetical\r\nplanet. The discovery of Uranus, at a distance falling but slightly\r\nshort of perfect conformity with the law of Titius, lent weight to a\r\nseemingly hazardous prediction, and Von Zach was actually at the pains,\r\nin 1785, to calculate what he termed \"analogical\" elements[200] for this\r\nunseen and (by any effect or influence) _unfelt_ body. The search for\r\nit, through confessedly scarcely less chimerical than that of alchemists\r\nfor the philosopher's stone, he kept steadily in view for fifteen years,\r\nand at length (September 21, 1800) succeeded in organising, in\r\ncombination with five other German astronomers assembled at Lilienthal,\r\na force of what he jocularly termed celestial police, for the express\r\npurpose of tracking and intercepting the fugitive subject of the sun.\r\nThe zodiac was accordingly divided for purposes of scrutiny into\r\ntwenty-four zones; their apportionment to separate observers was in part\r\neffected, and the association was rapidly getting into working order,\r\nwhen news arrived that the missing planet had been found, through no\r\nsystematic plan of search, but by the diligent, though otherwise\r\ndirected labours of a distant watcher of the skies.\r\n\r\nGiuseppe Piazzi was born at Ponte in the Valtelline, July 16, 1746. He\r\nstudied at various places and times under Tiraboschi, Beccaria,\r\nJacquier, and Le Sueur; and having entered the Theatine order of monks\r\nat the age of eighteen, he taught philosophy, science, and theology in\r\nseveral of the Italian cities, as well as in Malta, until 1780, when the\r\nchair of mathematics in the University of Palermo was offered to and\r\naccepted by him. Prince Caramanico, then viceroy of Sicily, had\r\nscientific leanings, and was easily won over to the project of building\r\nan observatory, a commodious foundation for which was afforded by one of\r\nthe towers of the viceregal palace. This architecturally incongruous\r\naddition to an ancient Saracenic edifice--once the abode of Kelbite and\r\nZirite Emirs--was completed in February, 1791. Piazzi, meanwhile, had\r\ndevoted nearly three years to the assiduous study of his new profession,\r\nacquiring a practical knowledge of Lalande's methods at the École\r\nMilitaire, and of Maskelyne's at the Royal Observatory; and returned to\r\nPalermo in 1789, bringing with him, in the great five-foot circle which\r\nhe had prevailed upon Ramsden to construct, the most perfect measuring\r\ninstrument hitherto employed by an astronomer.\r\n\r\nHe had been above nine years at work on his star-catalogue, and was\r\nstill profoundly unconscious that a place amongst the Lilienthal\r\nband[201] of astronomical detectives was being held in reserve for him,\r\nwhen, on the first evening of the nineteenth century, January 1, 1801,\r\nhe noticed the position of an eighth-magnitude star in a part of the\r\nconstellation Taurus to which an error of Wollaston's had directed his\r\nspecial attention. Reobserving, according to his custom, the same set of\r\nfifty stars on four consecutive nights, it seemed to him, on the 2nd,\r\nthat the one in question had slightly shifted its position to the west;\r\non the 3rd he assured himself of the fact, and believed that he had\r\nchanced upon a new kind of comet without tail or coma. The wandering\r\nbody, whatever its nature, exchanged retrograde for direct motion on\r\nJanuary 14,[202] and was carefully watched by Piazzi until February 11,\r\nwhen a dangerous illness interrupted his observations. He had, however,\r\nnot omitted to give notice of his discovery; but so precarious were\r\ncommunications in those unpeaceful times, that his letter to Oriani of\r\nJanuary 23 did not reach Milan until April 5, while a missive of one day\r\nlater addressed to Bode came to hand at Berlin, March 20. The delay just\r\nafforded time for the publication, by a young philosopher of Jena named\r\nHegel, of a \"Dissertation\" showing, by the clearest light of reason,\r\nthat the number of the planets could not exceed seven, and exposing the\r\nfolly of certain devotees of induction who sought a new celestial body\r\nmerely to fill a gap in a numerical series.[203]\r\n\r\nUnabashed by speculative scorn, Bode had scarcely read Piazzi's letter\r\nwhen he concluded that it referred to the precise body in question. The\r\nnews spread rapidly, and created a profound sensation, not unmixed with\r\nalarm lest this latest addition to the solar family should have been\r\nfound only to be again lost. For by that time Piazzi's moving star was\r\ntoo near the sun to be any longer visible, and in order to rediscover it\r\nafter conjunction a tolerably accurate knowledge of its path was\r\nindispensable. But a planetary orbit had never before been calculated\r\nfrom such scanty data as Piazzi's observation afforded;[204] and the\r\nattempts made by nearly every astronomer of note in Germany to compass\r\nthe problem were manifestly inadequate, failing even to account for the\r\npositions in which the body had been actually seen, and _à fortiori_\r\nserving only to mislead as to the places where, from September, 1801, it\r\nought once more to have become discernible. It was in this extremity\r\nthat the celebrated mathematician Gauss came to the rescue. He was then\r\nin his twenty-fifth year, and was earning his bread by tuition at\r\nBrunswick, with many possibilities, but no settled career before him.\r\nThe news from Palermo may be said to have converted him from an\r\narithmetician into an astronomer. He was already in possession of a new\r\nand more general method of computing elliptical orbits; and the system\r\nof \"least squares,\" which he had devised though not published, enabled\r\nhim to extract the most probable result from a given set of\r\nobservations. Armed with these novel powers, he set to work; and the\r\ncommunication in November of his elements and ephemeris for the lost\r\nobject revived the drooping hopes of the little band of eager searchers.\r\nTheir patience, however, was to be still further tried. Clouds, mist,\r\nand sleet seemed to have conspired to cover the retreat of the fugitive;\r\nbut on the last night of the year the sky cleared unexpectedly with the\r\nsetting in of a hard frost, and there, in the north-western part of\r\nVirgo, nearly in the position assigned by Gauss to the runaway planet, a\r\nstrange star was discerned by Von Zach[205] at Gotha, and on a\r\nsubsequent evening--the anniversary of the original discovery--by Olbers\r\nat Bremen. The name of Ceres (as the tutelary goddess of Sicily) was, by\r\nPiazzi's request, bestowed upon this first known of the numerous, and\r\nprobably all but innumerable family of the minor planets.\r\n\r\nThe recognition of the second followed as the immediate consequence of\r\nthe detection of the first. Olbers had made himself so familiar with the\r\npositions of the small stars along the track of the long-missing body,\r\nthat he was at once struck (March 28, 1802) with the presence of an\r\nintruder near the spot where he had recently identified Ceres. He at\r\nfirst believed the new-comer to be a variable star usually\r\ninconspicuous, but just then at its maximum of brightness; but within\r\ntwo hours he had convinced himself that it was no _fixed_ star, but a\r\nrapidly moving object. The aid of Gauss was again invoked, and his\r\nprompt calculations showed that this fresh celestial acquaintance (named\r\n\"Pallas\" by Olbers), revolved round the sun at nearly the same mean\r\ndistance as Ceres, and was beyond question of a strictly analogous\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThis result was perplexing in the extreme. The symmetry and simplicity\r\nof the planetary scheme appeared fatally compromised by the admission of\r\nmany, where room could, according to old-fashioned rules, only be found\r\nfor one. A daring hypothesis of Olbers's invention provided an exit from\r\nthe difficulty. He supposed that both Ceres and Pallas were fragments of\r\na primitive trans-Martian planet, blown to pieces in the remote past,\r\neither by the action of internal forces or by the impact of a comet; and\r\npredicted that many more such fragments would be found to circulate in\r\nthe same region. He, moreover, pointed out that these numerous orbits,\r\nhowever much they might differ in other respects, must all have a common\r\nline of intersection,[206] and that the bodies moving in them must\r\nconsequently pass, at each revolution, through two opposite points of\r\nthe heavens, one situated in the Whale, the other in the constellation\r\nof the Virgin, where already Pallas had been found and Ceres recaptured.\r\nThe intimation that fresh discoveries might be expected in those\r\nparticular regions was singularly justified by the detection of two\r\nbodies now known respectively as Juno and Vesta. The first was found\r\nnear the predicted spot in Cetus by Harding, Schröter's assistant at\r\nLilienthal, September 2, 1804; the second by Olbers himself in Virgo,\r\nafter three years of persistent scrutiny, March 29, 1807.\r\n\r\nThe theory of an exploded planet now seemed to have everything in its\r\nfavour. It required that the mean or average distances of the\r\nnewly-discovered bodies should be nearly the same, but admitted a wide\r\nrange of variety in the shapes and positions of their orbits, provided\r\nalways that they preserved common points of intersection. These\r\nconditions were fulfilled with a striking approach to exactness. Three\r\nof the four \"asteroids\" (a designation introduced by Sir. W.\r\nHerschel[207]) conformed with very approximate precision to \"Bode's law\"\r\nof distances; they all traversed, in their circuits round the sun,\r\nnearly the same parts of Cetus and Virgo; while the eccentricities and\r\ninclinations of their paths departed widely from the planetary\r\ntype--that of Pallas, to take an extreme instance, making with the\r\necliptic an angle of nearly 35°. The minuteness of these bodies appeared\r\nfurther to strengthen the imputation of a fragmentary character.\r\nHerschel estimated the diameter of Ceres at 162, that of Pallas at 147\r\nmiles.[208] But these values are now known to be considerably too small.\r\nA suspected variability of brightness in some of the asteroids, somewhat\r\nhazardously explained as due to the irregularities of figure to be\r\nexpected in cosmical _potsherds_ (so to speak), was added to the\r\nconfirmatory evidence.[209] The strong point of the theory, however, lay\r\nnot in what it explained, but in what it had predicted. It had been\r\ntwice confirmed by actual exploration of the skies, and had produced, in\r\nthe recognition of Vesta, the first recorded instance of the\r\n_premeditated_ discovery of a heavenly body.\r\n\r\nThe view not only commended itself to the facile imagination of the\r\nunlearned, but received the sanction of the highest scientific\r\nauthority. The great Lagrange bestowed upon it his analytical\r\n_imprimatur_, showing that the explosive forces required to produce the\r\nsupposed catastrophe came well within the bounds of possibility; since a\r\nvelocity of less than twenty times that of a cannon-ball leaving the\r\ngun's mouth would have sufficed, according to his calculation, to launch\r\nthe asteroidal fragments on their respective paths. Indeed, he was\r\ndisposed to regard the hypothesis of disruption as more generally\r\navailable than its author had designed it to be, and proposed to\r\nsupplement with it, as explanatory of the eccentric orbits of comets,\r\nthe nebular theory of Laplace, thereby obtaining, as he said, \"a\r\ncomplete view of the origin of the planetary system more conformable to\r\nNature and mechanical laws than any yet proposed.\"[210]\r\n\r\nNevertheless the hypothesis of Olbers has not held its ground. It seemed\r\nas if all the evidence available for its support had been produced at\r\nonce and spontaneously, while the unfavourable items were elicited\r\nslowly, and, as it were, by cross-examination. A more extended\r\nacquaintance with the group of bodies whose peculiarities it was framed\r\nto explain has shown them, after all, as recalcitrant to any such\r\nexplanation. Coincidences at the first view significant and striking\r\nhave been swamped by contrary examples; and a hasty general conclusion\r\nhas, by a not uncommon destiny, at last perished under the accumulation\r\nof particulars. Moreover, as has been remarked by Professor\r\nNewcomb,[211] mutual perturbations would rapidly efface all traces of a\r\ncommon disruptive origin, and the catastrophe, to be perceptible in its\r\neffects, should have been comparatively recent.\r\n\r\nA new generation of astronomers had arisen before any additions were\r\nmade to the little family of the minor planets. Piazzi died in 1826,\r\nHarding in 1834, Olbers in 1840; all those who had prepared or\r\nparticipated in the first discoveries passed away without witnessing\r\ntheir resumption. In 1830, however, a certain Hencke, ex-postmaster in\r\nthe Prussian town of Driessen, set himself to watch for new planets, and\r\nafter fifteen long years his patience was rewarded. The asteroid found\r\nby him, December 8, 1845, received the name of Astræa, and his further\r\nprosecution of the search resulted, July 1, 1847, in the discovery of\r\nHebe. A few weeks later (August 13), John Russell Hind (1823-1893),\r\nafter many months' exploration from Mr. Bishop's observatory in the\r\nRegent's Park, picked up Iris, and October 18, Flora.[212] The next on\r\nthe list was Metis, found by Mr. Graham, April 25, 1848, at Markree, in\r\nIreland.[213] At the close of the period to which our attention is at\r\npresent limited, the number of these small bodies known to astronomy was\r\nthirteen; and the course of discovery has since proceeded far more\r\nrapidly and with less interruption.\r\n\r\nBoth in itself and in its consequences the recognition of the minor\r\nplanets was of the highest importance to science. The traditional ideas\r\nregarding the constitution of the solar system were enlarged by the\r\nadmission of a new class of bodies, strongly contrasted, yet strictly\r\nco-ordinate with the old-established planetary order; the profusion of\r\nresource, so conspicuous in the living kingdoms of Nature, was seen to\r\nprevail no less in the celestial spaces; and some faint preliminary\r\nnotion was afforded of the indefinite complexity of relations underlying\r\nthe apparent simplicity of the majestic scheme to which our world\r\nbelongs. Both theoretical and practical astronomy derived profit from\r\nthe admission of these apparently insignificant strangers to the rights\r\nof citizenship of the solar system. The disturbance of their motions by\r\ntheir giant neighbours afforded a more accurate knowledge of the Jovian\r\nmass, which Laplace had taken about 1/50 too small; the anomalous\r\ncharacter of their orbits presented geometers with highly stimulating\r\nproblems in the theory of perturbation; while the exigencies of the\r\nfirst discovery had produced the _Theoria Motus_, and won Gauss over to\r\nthe ranks of calculating astronomy. Moreover, the sure prospect of\r\nfurther detections powerfully incited to the exploration of the skies;\r\nobservers became more numerous and more zealous in view of the prizes\r\nheld out to them; star-maps were diligently constructed, and the\r\nsidereal multitude strewn along the great zodiacal belt acquired a fresh\r\ninterest when it was perceived that its least conspicuous member might\r\nbe a planetary shred or projectile in the dignified disguise of a\r\ndistant sun. Harding's \"Celestial Atlas,\" designed for the special\r\npurpose of facilitating asteroidal research, was the first systematic\r\nattempt to represent to the eye the _telescopic_ aspect of the heavens.\r\nIt was while engaged on its construction that the Lilienthal observer\r\nsuccessfully intercepted Juno on her passage through the Whale in 1804;\r\nwhereupon promoted to Göttingen, he there completed, in 1822, the\r\narduous task so opportunely entered upon a score of years previously.\r\nStill more important were the great star-maps of the Berlin Academy,\r\nundertaken at Bessel's suggestion, with the same object of\r\ndistinguishing errant from fixed stars, and executed, under Encke's\r\nsupervision, during the years 1830-59. They have played a noteworthy\r\npart in the history of planetary discovery, nor of the minor kind alone.\r\n\r\nWe have now to recount an event unique in scientific history. The\r\ndiscovery of Neptune has been characterised as the result of a \"movement\r\nof the age,\"[214] and with some justice. It had become necessary to the\r\nintegrity of planetary theory. Until it was accomplished, the phantom of\r\nan unexplained anomaly in the orderly movements of the solar system must\r\nhave continued to haunt astronomical consciousness. Moreover, it was\r\nprepared by many, suggested as possible by not a few, and actually\r\nachieved, simultaneously, independently, and completely, by two\r\ninvestigators.\r\n\r\nThe position of the planet Uranus was recorded as that of a fixed star\r\nno less than twenty times between 1690 and the epoch of its final\r\ndetection by Herschel. But these early observations, far from affording\r\nthe expected facilities for the calculation of its orbit, proved a\r\nsource of grievous perplexity. The utmost ingenuity of geometers failed\r\nto combine them satisfactorily with the later Uranian places, and it\r\nbecame evident, either that they were widely erroneous, or that the\r\nrevolving body was wandering from its ancient track. The simplest course\r\nwas to reject them altogether, and this was done in the new Tables\r\npublished in 1821 by Alexis Bouvard, the indefatigable computating\r\npartner of Laplace. But the trouble was not thus to be got rid of. After\r\na few years fresh irregularities began to appear, and continued to\r\nincrease until absolutely \"intolerable.\" It may be stated as\r\nillustrative of the perfection to which astronomy had been brought, that\r\ndivergencies regarded as menacing the very foundation of its theories\r\nnever entered the range of unaided vision. In other words, if the\r\ntheoretical and the real Uranus had been placed side by side in the sky,\r\nthey would have seemed, to the sharpest eye, to form a single body.[215]\r\n\r\nThe idea that these enigmatical disturbances were due to the attraction\r\nof an unknown exterior body was a tolerably obvious one; and we\r\naccordingly find it suggested in many different quarters. Bouvard\r\nhimself was perhaps the first to conceive it. He kept the possibility\r\ncontinually in view, and bequeathed to his nephew's diligence the\r\ninquiry into its reality when he felt that his own span was drawing to a\r\nclose; but before any progress had been made with it, he had already\r\n(June 7, 1843) \"ceased to breathe and to calculate.\" The Rev. T. J.\r\nHussey actually entertained in 1834 the notion, but found his powers\r\ninadequate to the task, of assigning an approximate place to the\r\ndisturbing body; and Bessel, in 1840, laid his plans for an assault in\r\nform upon the Uranian difficulty, the triumphant exit from which fatal\r\nillness frustrated his hopes of effecting or even witnessing.\r\n\r\nThe problem was practically untouched when, in 1841, an undergraduate of\r\nSt. John's College, Cambridge, formed the resolution of grappling with\r\nit. The projected task was an arduous one. There were no guiding\r\nprecedents for its conduct. Analytical obstacles had to be encountered\r\nso formidable as to appear invincible even to such a mathematician as\r\nAiry. John Couch Adams, however, had no sooner taken his degree, which\r\nhe did as senior wrangler in January, 1843, than he set resolutely to\r\nwork, and on October 21, 1845, was able to communicate to the Astronomer\r\nRoyal numerical estimates of the elements and mass of the unknown\r\nplanet, together with an indication of its actual place in the heavens.\r\nThese results, it has been well said,[216] gave \"the final and\r\ninexorable proof\" of the validity of Newton's Law. The date October 21,\r\n1845, \"may therefore be regarded as marking a distinct epoch in the\r\nhistory of gravitational astronomy.\"\r\n\r\nSir George Biddell Airy had begun in 1835 his long and energetic\r\nadministration of the Royal Observatory, and was already in possession\r\nof data vitally important to the momentous inquiry then on foot. At his\r\nsuggestion, and under his superintendence, the reduction of all the\r\nplanetary observations made at Greenwich from 1750 onwards had been\r\nundertaken in 1833. The results, published in 1846, constituted a\r\npermanent and universal stock of materials for the correction of\r\nplanetary theory. But in the meantime, investigators, both native and\r\nforeign, were freely supplied with the \"places and errors,\" which,\r\nclearly exhibiting the discrepancies between observation and\r\ncalculation--between what _was_ and what was _expected_--formed the very\r\ngroundwork of future improvements.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams had no reason to complain of official discourtesy. His labours\r\nreceived due and indispensable aid; but their purpose was regarded as\r\nchimerical. \"I have always,\" Sir George Airy wrote,[217] \"considered the\r\ncorrectness of a distant mathematical result to be a subject rather of\r\nmoral than of mathematical evidence.\" And that actually before him\r\nseemed, from its very novelty, to incur a suspicion of unlikelihood. No\r\nproblem in planetary disturbance had heretofore been attacked, so to\r\nspeak, from the rear. The inverse method was untried, and might well be\r\ndeemed impracticable. For the difficulty of determining the\r\nperturbations produced by a given planet is small compared with the\r\ndifficulty of finding a planet by its resulting perturbations. Laplace\r\nmight have quailed before it; yet it was now grappled with as a first\r\nessay in celestial dynamics. Moreover, Adams unaccountably neglected to\r\nanswer until too late a question regarded by Airy in the light of an\r\n_experimentum crucis_ as to the soundness of the new theory. Nor did he\r\nhimself take any steps to obtain a publicity which he was more anxious\r\nto merit than to secure. The investigation consequently remained buried\r\nin obscurity. It is now known that had a search been instituted in the\r\nautumn of 1845 for the remote body whose existence had been so\r\nmarvellously foretold, it would have been found within _three and a half\r\nlunar diameters_ (1° 49') of the spot assigned to it by Adams.\r\n\r\nA competitor, however, equally daring and more fortunate--_audax fortunâ\r\nadjutus_, as Gauss said of him--was even then entering the field. Urbain\r\nJean Joseph Leverrier, the son of a small Government _employé_ in\r\nNormandy, was born at Saint-Lô, March 11, 1811. He studied with\r\nbrilliant success at the École Polytechnique, accepted the post of\r\nastronomical teacher there in 1837, and, \"docile to circumstance,\"\r\nimmediately concentrated the whole of his vast, though as yet\r\nundeveloped powers upon the formidable problems, of celestial mechanics.\r\nHe lost no time in proving to the mathematical world that the race of\r\ngiants was not extinct. Two papers on the stability of the solar system,\r\npresented to the Academy of Sciences, September 16 and October 14, 1839,\r\nshowed him to be the worthy successor of Lagrange and Laplace, and\r\nencouraged hopes destined to be abundantly realised. His attention was\r\ndirected by Arago to the Uranian difficulty in 1845, when he cheerfully\r\nput aside certain intricate cometary researches upon which he happened\r\nto be engaged, in order to obey with dutiful promptitude the summons of\r\nthe astronomical chief of France. In his first memoir on the subject\r\n(communicated to the Academy, November 10, 1845), he proved the\r\ninadequacy of all known causes of disturbance to account for the\r\nvagaries of Uranus; in a second (June 1, 1848), he demonstrated that\r\nonly an exterior body, occupying at a certain date a determinate\r\nposition in the zodiac, could produce the observed effects; in a third\r\n(August 31, 1846), he assigned the orbit of the disturbing body, and\r\nannounced its visibility as an object with a sensible disc about as\r\nbright as a star of the eighth magnitude.\r\n\r\nThe question was now visibly approaching an issue. On September 10, Sir\r\nJohn Herschel declared to the British Association respecting the\r\nhypothetical new planet: \"We see it as Columbus saw America from the\r\ncoast of Spain. Its movements have been felt, trembling along the\r\nfar-reaching line of our analysis with a certainty hardly inferior to\r\nthat of ocular demonstration.\" Less than a fortnight later, September\r\n23, Professor Galle, of the Berlin Observatory, received a letter from\r\nLeverrier requesting his aid in the telescopic part of the inquiry\r\nalready analytically completed. He directed his refractor to the heavens\r\nthat same night, and perceived, within less than a degree of the spot\r\nindicated, an object with a measurable disc nearly three seconds in\r\ndiameter. Its absence from Bremiker's recently-completed map of that\r\nregion of the sky showed it to be no star, and its movement in the\r\npredicted direction confirmed without delay the strong persuasion of its\r\nplanetary nature.[218]\r\n\r\nIn this remarkable manner the existence of the remote member of our\r\nsystem known as \"Neptune\" was ascertained. But the discovery, which\r\nfaithfully reflected the duplicate character of the investigation which\r\nled to it, had been already secured at Cambridge before it was announced\r\nfrom Berlin. Sir George Airy's incredulity vanished in the face of the\r\nstriking coincidence between the position assigned by Leverrier to the\r\nunknown planet in June, and that laid down by Adams in the previous\r\nOctober; and on the 9th of July he wrote to Professor Challis, director\r\nof the Cambridge Observatory, recommending a search with the great\r\nNorthumberland equatoreal. Had a good star-map been at hand, the process\r\nwould have been a simple one; but of Bremiker's \"Hora XXI.\" no news had\r\nyet reached England, and there was no other sufficiently comprehensive\r\nto be available for an inquiry which, in the absence of such aid,\r\npromised to be both long and laborious. As the event proved, it might\r\nhave been neither. \"After four days of observing,\" Challis wrote,\r\nOctober 12, 1846, to Airy, \"the planet was in my grasp if only I had\r\nexamined or mapped the observations.\"[219] Had he done so, the first\r\nhonours in the discovery, both theoretical and optical, would have\r\nfallen to the University of Cambridge. But Professor Challis had other\r\nastronomical avocations to attend to, and, moreover, his faith in the\r\nprecision of the indications furnished to him was, by his own\r\nconfession, a very feeble one. For both reasons he postponed to a later\r\nstage of the proceedings the discussion and comparison of the data\r\nnightly furnished to him by his telescope, and thus allowed to lie, as\r\nit were, latent in his observations the momentous result which his\r\ndiligence had insured, but which his delay suffered to be\r\nanticipated.[220]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it should not be forgotten that the Berlin astronomer had\r\ntwo circumstances in his favour apart from which his swift success could\r\nhardly have been achieved. The first was the possession of a good\r\nstar-map; the second was the clear and confident nature of Leverrier's\r\ninstructions. \"Look where I tell you,\" he seemed authoritatively to say,\r\n\"and you will see an object such as I describe.\"[221] And in fact, not\r\nonly Galle on the 23rd of September, but also Challis on the 29th,\r\nimmediately after reading the French geometer's lucid and impressive\r\ntreatise, picked out from among the stellar points strewing the zodiac,\r\na small planetary disc, which eventually proved to be that of the\r\nprecise body he had been in search of during two months.\r\n\r\nThe controversy that ensued had its ignominious side; but it was entered\r\ninto by neither of the parties principally concerned. Adams bore the\r\ndisappointment, which the dilatory proceedings at Greenwich and\r\nCambridge had inflicted upon him, with quiet heroism. His silence on the\r\nsubject of what another man would have called his wrongs remained\r\nunbroken to the end of his life;[222] and he took every opportunity of\r\ntestifying his admiration for the genius of Leverrier.\r\n\r\nPersonal questions, however, vanish in the magnitude of the event they\r\nrelate to. By it the last lingering doubts as to the absolute exactness\r\nof the Newtonian Law were dissipated. Recondite analytical methods\r\nreceived a confirmation brilliant and intelligible even to the minds of\r\nthe vulgar, and emerged from the patient solitude of the study to enjoy\r\nan hour of clamorous triumph. For ever invisible to the unaided eye of\r\nman, a sister-globe to our earth was shown to circulate, in perpetual\r\nfrozen exile, at thirty times its distance from the sun. Nay, the\r\npossibility was made apparent that the limits of our system were not\r\neven thus reached, but that yet profounder abysses of space might\r\nshelter obedient, though little favoured, members of the solar family,\r\nby future astronomers to be recognised through the sympathetic\r\nthrillings of Neptune, even as Neptune himself was recognised through\r\nthe tell-tale deviations of Uranus.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to find that the fruit of Adams's and Leverrier's\r\nlaborious investigations had been accidentally all but snatched half a\r\ncentury before it was ripe to be gathered. On the 8th, and again on the\r\n10th of May, 1795, Lalande noted the position of Neptune as that of a\r\nfixed star, but perceiving that the two observations did not agree, he\r\nsuppressed the first as erroneous, and pursued the inquiry no further.\r\nAn immortality which he would have been the last to despise hung in the\r\nbalance; the feather-weight of his carelessness, however, kicked the\r\nbeam, and the discovery was reserved to be more hardly won by later\r\ncomers.\r\n\r\nBode's Law did good service in the quest for a trans-Uranian planet by\r\naffording ground for a probable assumption as to its distance. A\r\nstarting-point for approximation was provided by it; but it was soon\r\nfound to be considerably at fault. Even Uranus is about 36 millions of\r\nmiles nearer to the sun than the order of progression requires; and\r\nNeptune's vast distance of 2,800 million should be increased by no less\r\nthan 800 million miles, and its period of 165 lengthened out to 225\r\nyears,[223] in order to bring it into conformity with the curious and\r\nunexplained rule which planetary discoveries have alternately tended to\r\nconfirm and to invalidate.\r\n\r\nWithin seventeen days of its identification with the Berlin achromatic,\r\nNeptune was found to be attended by a satellite. This discovery was the\r\nfirst notable performance of the celebrated two-foot reflector[224]\r\nerected by Mr. Lassell at his suggestively named residence of Starfield,\r\nnear Liverpool. William Lassell was a brewer by profession, but by\r\ninclination an astronomer. Born at Bolton in Lancashire, June 18, 1799,\r\nhe closed a life of eminent usefulness to science, October 5, 1818, thus\r\nspanning with his well-spent years four-fifths of the momentous period\r\nwhich we have undertaken to traverse. At the age of twenty-one, being\r\nwithout the means to purchase, he undertook to construct telescopes, and\r\nnaturally turned his attention to the reflecting sort, as favouring\r\namateur efforts by the comparative simplicity of its structure. His\r\nnative ingenuity was remarkable, and was developed by the hourly\r\nexigencies of his successive enterprises. Their uniform success\r\nencouraged him to enlarge his aims, and in 1844 he visited Birr Castle\r\nfor the purpose of inspecting the machine used in polishing the giant\r\nspeculum of Parsonstown. In the construction of his new instrument,\r\nhowever, he eventually discarded the model there obtained, and worked on\r\na method of his own, assisted by the supreme mechanical skill of James\r\nNasmyth. The result was a Newtonian of exquisite definition, with an\r\naperture of two, and a focal length of twenty feet, provided by a novel\r\nartifice with the equatoreal mounting, previously regarded as available\r\nonly for refractors.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful instrument afforded to its maker, October 10, 1846, a\r\ncursory view of a Neptunian attendant. But the planet was then\r\napproaching the sun, and it was not until the following July that the\r\nobservation could be verified, which it was completely, first by Lassell\r\nhimself, and somewhat later by Otto Stuve and Bond of Cambridge (U.S.).\r\nWhen it is considered that this remote object shines by reflecting\r\nsunlight reduced by distance to 1/900th of the intensity with which it\r\nilluminates our moon, the fact of its visibility, even in the most\r\nperfect telescopes, is a somewhat surprising one. It can only, indeed,\r\nbe accounted for by attributing to it dimensions very considerable for a\r\nbody of the secondary order. It shares with the moons of Uranus the\r\npeculiarity of retrograde motion; that is to say, its revolutions,\r\nrunning counter to the grand current of movement in the solar system,\r\nare performed from east to west, in a plane inclined at an angle of 35°\r\nto that of the ecliptic. Their swiftness serves to measure the mass of\r\nthe globe round which they are performed. For while our moon takes\r\ntwenty-seven days and nearly eight hours to complete its circuit of the\r\nearth, the satellite of Neptune, at a distance not greatly inferior,\r\nsweeps round its primary in five days and twenty-one hours, showing\r\n(according to a very simple principle of computation) that it is urged\r\nby a force seventeen times greater than the terrestrial pull upon the\r\nlunar orb. Combining this result with those of Professor Barnard's[225]\r\nand Dr. See's[226] recent measurements of the small telescopic disc of\r\nthis farthest known planet, it is found that while in _mass_ Neptune\r\nequals seventeen, in _bulk_ it is equivalent to forty-nine earths. This\r\nis as much as to say that it is composed of relatively very light\r\nmaterials, or more probably of materials distended by internal heat, as\r\nyet unwasted by radiation into space, to about five times the volume\r\nthey would occupy in the interior of our globe. The fact, at any rate,\r\nis fairly well ascertained, that the average density of Neptune is about\r\ntwice that of water.\r\n\r\nWe must now turn from this late-recognised member of our system to\r\nbestow some brief attention upon the still fruitful field of discovery\r\noffered by one of the immemorial five. The family of Saturn, unlike that\r\nof its brilliant neighbour, has been gradually introduced to the notice\r\nof astronomers. Titan, the sixth Saturnian moon in order of distance,\r\nled the way, being detected by Huygens, March 25, 1655; Cassini made the\r\nacquaintance of four more between 1671 and 1684; while Mimas and\r\nEnceladus, the two innermost, were caught by Herschel in 1789, as they\r\nthreaded their lucid way along the edge of the almost vanished ring. In\r\nthe distances of these seven revolving bodies from their primary, an\r\norder of progression analogous to that pointed out by Titius in the\r\nplanetary intervals was found to prevail; but with one conspicuous\r\ninterruption, similar to that which had first suggested the search for\r\nnew members of the solar system. Between Titan and Japetus--the sixth\r\nand seventh reckoning outwards--there was obviously room for another\r\nsatellite. It was discovered on both sides of the Atlantic\r\nsimultaneously, on the 19th of September, 1848. Mr. W. C. Bond,\r\nemploying the splendid 15-inch refractor of the Harvard Observatory,\r\nnoticed, September 16, a minute star situated in the plane of Saturn's\r\nrings. The same object was discerned by Mr. Lassell on the 18th. On the\r\nfollowing evening, both observers perceived that the problematical speck\r\nof light kept up with, instead of being left behind by the planet as it\r\nmoved, and hence inferred its true character.[227] Hyperion, the seventh\r\nby distance and eighth by recognition of Saturn's attendant train, is of\r\nso insignificant a size when compared with some of its fellow-moons\r\n(Titan is but little inferior to the planet Mars), as to have suggested\r\nto Sir John Herschel[228] the idea that it might be only one of several\r\nbodies revolving very close together--in fact, an _asteroidal\r\nsatellite_; but the conjecture has, so far, not been verified.\r\n\r\nThe coincidence of its duplicate discovery was singularly paralleled two\r\nyears later. Galileo's amazement when his \"optic glass\" revealed to him\r\nthe \"triple\" form of Saturn--_planeta tergeminus_--has proved to be,\r\nlike the laughter of the gods, \"inextinguishable.\" It must revive in\r\nevery one who contemplates anew the unique arrangements of that world\r\napart known to us as the Saturnian system. The resolution of the\r\nso-called _ansæ_, or \"handles,\" into one encircling ring by Huygens in\r\n1655, the discovery by Cassini in 1675 of the division of that ring into\r\ntwo concentric ones, together with Laplace's investigation of the\r\nconditions of stability of such a formation, constituted, with some\r\nminor observations, the sum of the knowledge obtained, up to the middle\r\nof the last century, on the subject of this remarkable formation. The\r\nfirst place in the discovery now about to be related belongs to an\r\nAmerican astronomer.\r\n\r\nWilliam Cranch Bond, born in 1789 at Portland, in the State of Maine,\r\nwas a watchmaker, whom the solar eclipse of 1806 attracted to study the\r\nwonders of the heavens. When, in 1815, the erection of an observatory in\r\nconnection with Harvard College, Cambridge, was first contemplated, he\r\nundertook a mission to England for the purpose of studying the working\r\nof similar institutions there, and on his return erected a private\r\nobservatory at Dorchester, where he worked diligently for many years.\r\nThen at last, in 1843, the long-postponed design of the Harvard\r\nauthorities was resumed, and on the completion of the new establishment,\r\nBond, who had been from 1838 officially connected with the College and\r\nhad carried on his scientific labours within its precincts, was offered\r\nand accepted the post of its director. Placed in 1847 in possession of\r\none of the finest instruments in the world--a masterpiece of Merz and\r\nMahler--he headed the now long list of distinguished Transatlantic\r\nobservers. Like the elder Struve, he left an heir to his office and to\r\nhis eminence, but George Bond unfortunately died in 1865, at the early\r\nage of thirty-nine, having survived his father but six years.\r\n\r\nOn the night of November 15, 1850--the air, remarkably enough, being so\r\nhazy that only the brightest stars could be perceived with the naked\r\neye--William Bond discerned a dusky ring, extending about halfway\r\nbetween the inner brighter one and the globe of Saturn. A fortnight\r\nlater, but before the observation had been announced in England, the\r\nsame appearance was seen by the Rev. W. R. Dawes with the comparatively\r\nsmall refractor of his observatory at Wateringbury, and on December 3\r\nwas described by Mr. Lassell (then on a visit to him) as \"something like\r\na crape veil covering a part of the sky within the inner ring.\"[229]\r\nNext morning the _Times_ containing the report of Bond's discovery\r\nreached Wateringbury. The most surprising circumstance in the matter was\r\nthat the novel appendage had remained so long unrecognised. As the rings\r\nopened out to their full extent, it became obvious with very moderate\r\noptical assistance; yet some of the most acute observers who have ever\r\nlived, using instruments of vast power, had heretofore failed to detect\r\nits presence. It soon appeared, however, that Galle of Berlin[230] had\r\nnoticed, June 10, 1838, a veil-like extension of the lucid ring across\r\nhalf the dark space separating it from the planet; but the observation,\r\nalthough communicated at the time to the Berlin Academy of Sciences, had\r\nremained barren. Traces of the dark ring, moreover, were found in\r\ndrawings executed by Campani in 1664[231] and by Hooke in 1666;[232]\r\nwhile Picard (June 15, 1673),[233] Hadley (spring of 1720),[234] and\r\nHerschel,[235] had all undoubtedly seen it under the aspect of a dark\r\nbar or belt crossing the Saturnian globe. It was, then, of no recent\r\norigin; but there seemed reason to think that it had lately gained\r\nconsiderably in brightness. The full meaning of this suspected change it\r\nwas reserved for later investigations to develop.\r\n\r\nWhat we may, in a certain sense, call the closing result of the race for\r\ndiscovery, in which several observers seemed at that time to be engaged,\r\nwas the establishment, on a satisfactory footing, of our acquaintance\r\nwith the dependent system of Uranus. Sir William Herschel, whose\r\nresearches formed, in so many distinct lines of astronomical inquiry,\r\nthe starting-points of future knowledge, detected, January 11,\r\n1787,[236] two Uranian moons, since called Oberon and Titania, and\r\nascertained the curious circumstance of their motion in a plane almost\r\nat right angles to the ecliptic, in a direction contrary to that of all\r\npreviously known denizens (other than cometary) of the solar kingdom. He\r\nbelieved that he caught occasional glimpses of four more, but never\r\nsucceeded in assuring himself of their substantial existence. Even the\r\ntwo first remained unseen save by himself until 1828, when his son\r\nre-observed them with a 20-foot reflector, similar to that with which\r\nthey had been originally discovered. Thenceforward they were kept fairly\r\nwithin view, but their four questionable companions, in spite of some\r\nfalse alarms of detection, remained in the dubious condition in which\r\nHerschel had left them. At last, on October 24, 1851,[237] after some\r\nyears of fruitless watching, Lassell espied \"Ariel\" and \"Umbriel,\" two\r\nUranian attendants, interior to Oberon and Titania, and of about half\r\ntheir brightness; so that their disclosure is still reckoned amongst the\r\nvery highest proofs of instrumental power and perfection. In all\r\nprobability they were then for the first time seen; for although\r\nProfessor Holden[238] made out a plausible case in favour of the fitful\r\nvisibility to Herschel of each of them in turn, Lassell's argument[239]\r\nthat the glare of the planet in Herschel's great specula must have\r\nrendered almost impossible the perception of objects so minute and so\r\nclose to its disc, appears tolerably decisive to the contrary. Uranus is\r\nthus attended by four moons, and, so far as present knowledge extends,\r\nby no more. Among the most important of the \"negative results\"[240]\r\nsecured by Lassell's observations at Malta during the years 1852-53 and\r\n1861-65, were the convincing evidence afforded by them that, without\r\ngreat increase of optical power, no further Neptunian or Uranian\r\nsatellites can be perceived, and the consequent relegation of Herschel's\r\nbaffling quartette, notwithstanding the unquestioned place long assigned\r\nto them in astronomical text-books, to the Nirvana of non-existence.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 195: _Op._, t. i., p. 107.

The velocity, in fact, of its rush round the\r\nsun was quite possibly sufficient to carry it off for ever into the\r\ndepths of space, there to wander, a celestial casual, from star to star.\r\nWith another comet, however, which appeared two years later, the case\r\nwas different. Edmund Halley, who afterwards succeeded Flamsteed as\r\nAstronomer Royal, calculated the elements of its orbit on Newton's\r\nprinciples, and found them to resemble so closely those similarly\r\narrived at for comets observed by Peter Apian in 1531, and by Kepler in\r\n1607, as almost to compel the inference that all three were apparitions\r\nof a single body. This implied its revolution in a period of about\r\nseventy-six years, and Halley accordingly fixed its return for 1758-9.\r\nSo fully alive was he to the importance of the announcement that he\r\nappealed to a \"candid posterity,\" in the event of its verification, to\r\nacknowledge that the discovery was due to an Englishman. The prediction\r\nwas one of the test-questions put by Science to Nature, on the replies\r\nto which largely depend both the development of knowledge and the\r\nconviction of its reality. In the present instance, the answer afforded\r\nmay be said to have laid the foundation of this branch of astronomy.\r\nHalley's comet punctually reappeared on Christmas Day, 1758, and\r\neffected its perihelion passage on the 12th of March following, thus\r\nproving beyond dispute that some at least of these erratic bodies are\r\ndomesticated within our system, and strictly conform, if not to its\r\nunwritten customs (so to speak), at any rate to its fundamental laws.\r\nTheir movements, in short, were demonstrated by the most unanswerable of\r\nall arguments--that of verified calculation--to be _calculable_, and\r\ntheir investigation was erected into a legitimate department of\r\nastronomical science.\r\n\r\nThis notable advance was the chief _result_ obtained in the field of\r\ninquiry just now under consideration during the eighteenth century. But\r\nbefore it closed, its cultivation had received a powerful stimulus\r\nthrough the invention of an improved _method_. The name of Olbers has\r\nalready been brought prominently before our readers in connection with\r\nasteroidal discoveries; these, however, were but chance excursions from\r\nthe path of cometary research which he steadily pursued through life. An\r\nearly predilection for the heavens was fixed in this particular\r\ndirection by one of the happy inspirations of genius. As he was\r\nwatching, one night in the year 1779, by the sick-bed of a\r\nfellow-student in medicine at Göttingen, an important simplification in\r\nthe mode of computing the paths of comets occurred to him. Although not\r\nmade public until 1797, \"Olbers's method\" was then universally adopted,\r\nand is still regarded as the most expeditious and convenient in cases\r\nwhere absolute rigour is not required. By its introduction, not only\r\nmany a toilsome and thankless hour was spared, but workers were\r\nmultiplied, and encouraged in the prosecution of labours more useful\r\nthan attractive.\r\n\r\nThe career of Heinrich Olbers is a brilliant example of what may be done\r\nby an amateur in astronomy. He at no time did regular work in an\r\nobservatory; he was never the possessor of a transit or any other fixed\r\ninstrument; moreover, all the best years of his life were absorbed in\r\nthe assiduous exercise of a toilsome profession. Born in 1758 at the\r\nvillage of Arbergen, where his father was pastor, he settled in 1781 as\r\na physician in the neighbouring town of Bremen, and continued in active\r\npractice there for over forty years. It was thus only the hours which\r\nhis robust constitution enabled him to spare from sleep that were\r\navailable for his intellectual pleasures. Yet his recreation was, as Von\r\nZach remarked,[241] no less prolific of useful results than the severest\r\nwork of other men. The upper part of his house in the Sandgasse was\r\nfitted up with such instruments and appliances as restrictions of space\r\npermitted, and there, night after night during half a century and\r\nupwards, he discovered, calculated, or observed the cometary visitants\r\nof northern skies. Almost as effective in promoting the interests of\r\nscience as the valuable work actually done by him, was the influence of\r\nhis genial personality. He engaged confidence by his ready and\r\ndiscerning sympathy; he inspired affection by his benevolent\r\ndisinterestedness; he quickened thought and awakened zeal by the\r\nsuggestions of a lively and inventive spirit, animated with the warmest\r\nenthusiasm for the advancement of knowledge. Nearly every astronomer in\r\nGermany enjoyed the benefits of a frequently active correspondence with\r\nhim, and his communications to the scientific periodicals of the time\r\nwere numerous and striking. The motive power of his mind was thus widely\r\nfelt and continually in action. Nor did it wholly cease to be exerted\r\neven when the advance of age and the progress of infirmity rendered him\r\nincapable of active occupation. He was, in fact, _alive_ even to the\r\nlast day of his long life of eighty-one years; and his death, which\r\noccurred March 2, 1840, left vacant a position which a rare combination\r\nof moral and intellectual qualities had conspired to render unique.\r\n\r\nAmongst the many younger men who were attracted and stimulated by\r\nintercourse with him was Johann Franz Encke. But while Olbers became a\r\nmathematician because he was an astronomer, Encke became an astronomer\r\nbecause he was a mathematician. A born geometer, he was naturally sent\r\nto Göttingen and placed under the tuition of Gauss. But geometers are\r\nmen; and the contagion of patriotic fervour which swept over Germany\r\nafter the battle of Leipsic did not spare Gauss's promising pupil. He\r\ntook up arms in the Hanseatic Legion, and marched and fought until the\r\noppressor of his country was safely ensconced behind the ocean-walls of\r\nSt. Helena. In the course of his campaigning he met Lindenau, the\r\nmilitant director of the Seeberg Observatory, and by his influence was\r\nappointed his assistant, and eventually, in 1822, became his successor.\r\nThence he was promoted in 1825 to Berlin, where he superintended the\r\nbuilding of the new observatory, so actively promoted by Humboldt, and\r\nremained at its head until within some eighteen months of his death in\r\nAugust, 1865.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of November, 1818, Pons of Marseilles discovered a comet,\r\nwhose inconspicuous appearance gave little promise of its becoming one\r\nof the most interesting objects in our system. Encke at once took the\r\ncalculation of its elements in hand, and brought out the unexpected\r\nresult that it revolved round the sun in a period of about 3-1/3\r\nyears.[242] He, moreover, detected its identity with comets seen by\r\nMéchain in 1786, by Caroline Herschel in 1795, by Pons, Huth, and\r\nBouvard in 1805, and after six laborious weeks of research into the\r\ndisturbances experienced by it from the planets during the entire\r\ninterval since its first ascertained appearance, he fixed May 24, 1822,\r\nas the date of its next return to perihelion. Although on that occasion,\r\nowing to the position of the earth, invisible in the northern\r\nhemisphere, Sir Thomas Brisbane's observatory at Paramatta was\r\nfortunately ready equipped for its recapture, which Rümker effected\r\nquite close to the spot indicated by Encke's ephemeris.\r\n\r\nThe importance of this event can be better understood when it is\r\nremembered that it was only the second instance of the recognised return\r\nof a comet (that of Halley's, sixty-three years previously, having, as\r\nalready stated, been the first); and that it, moreover, established the\r\nexistence of a new class of celestial objects, somewhat loosely\r\ndistinguished as \"comets of short period.\" These bodies (of which about\r\nthirty have been found to circulate within the orbit of Saturn) are\r\nremarkable as showing certain planetary affinities in the manners of\r\ntheir motions not at all perceptible in the wider travelling members of\r\ntheir order. They revolve, without exception, in the same direction as\r\nthe planets--from west to east; they exhibit a marked tendency to\r\nconform to the zodiacal track which limits planetary excursions north\r\nand south; and their paths round the sun, although much more eccentric\r\nthan the approximately circular planetary orbits, are far less so than\r\nthe extravagantly long ellipses in which comets comparatively untrained\r\n(as it were) in the habits of the solar system ordinarily perform their\r\nrevolutions.\r\n\r\nNo _great_ comet is of the \"planetary\" kind. These are, indeed, only by\r\nexception visible to the naked eye; they possess extremely feeble\r\ntail-producing powers, and give small signs of central condensation.\r\nThin wisps of cosmical cloud, they flit across the telescopic field of\r\nview without sensibly obscuring the smallest star. Their appearance, in\r\nshort, suggests--what some notable facts in their history will presently\r\nbe shown to confirm--that they are bodies already effete, and verging\r\ntowards dissolution. If it be asked what possible connection can be\r\nshown to exist between the shortness of period by which they are\r\nessentially characterised, and what we may call their _superannuated_\r\ncondition, we are not altogether at a loss for an answer. Kepler's\r\nremark,[243] that comets are consumed by their own emissions, has\r\nundoubtedly a measure of truth in it. The substance ejected into the\r\ntail must, in overwhelmingly large proportion, be for ever lost to the\r\ncentral mass from which it issues. True, it is of a nature inconceivably\r\ntenuous; but unrepaired waste, however small in amount, cannot be\r\npersisted in with impunity. The incitement to such self-spoliation\r\nproceeds from the sun; it accordingly progresses more rapidly the more\r\nnumerous are the returns to the solar vicinity. Comets of short period\r\nmay thus reasonably be expected to _wear out_ quickly.\r\n\r\nThey are, moreover, subject to many adventures and vicissitudes. Their\r\naphelia--or the farthest points of their orbits from the sun--are\r\nusually, if not invariably, situated so near to the path either of\r\nJupiter or of Saturn, as to permit these giant planets to act as\r\nsecondary rulers of their destinies. By their influence they were, in\r\nall likelihood, originally fixed in their present tracks; and by their\r\ninfluence, exerted in an opposite sense, they may, in some cases, be\r\neventually ejected from them. Careers so varied, as can easily be\r\nimagined, are apt to prove instructive, and astronomers have not been\r\nbackward in extracting from them the lessons they are fitted to convey.\r\nEncke's comet, above all, has served as an index to much curious\r\ninformation, and it may be hoped that its function in that respect is by\r\nno means at an end. The great extent of the solar system traversed by\r\nits eccentric path makes it peculiarly useful for the determination of\r\nthe planetary masses. At perihelion it penetrates within the orbit of\r\nMercury; it considerably transcends at aphelion the farthest excursion\r\nof Pallas. Its vicinity to the former planet in August, 1835, offered\r\nthe first convenient opportunity of placing that body in the\r\nastronomical balance. Its weight or mass had previously been assumed,\r\nnot ascertained; and the comparatively slight deviation from its regular\r\ncourse impressed upon the comet by its attractive power showed that it\r\nhad been assumed nearly twice too great.[244] That fundamental datum of\r\nplanetary astronomy--the mass of Jupiter--was corrected by similar\r\nmeans; and it was reassuring to find the correction in satisfactory\r\naccord with that already introduced from observations of the asteroidal\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\nThe fact that comets contract in approaching the sun had been noticed by\r\nHevelius; Pingré admitted it with hesitating perplexity;[245] the\r\nexample of Encke's comet rendered it conspicuous and undeniable. On the\r\n28th of October, 1828, the diameter of the nebulous matter composing\r\nthis body was estimated at 312,000 miles. It was then about one and a\r\nhalf times further from the sun than the earth is at the time of the\r\nequinox. On the 24th of December following, its distance being reduced\r\nby nearly two-thirds, it was found to be only 14,000 miles across.[246]\r\nThat is to say, it had shrunk during those two months of approach to\r\n1/11000th part of its original volume! Yet it had still seventeen days'\r\njourney to make before reaching perihelion. The same curious\r\ncircumstance was even more markedly apparent at its return in 1838. Its\r\nbulk, or the actual space occupied by it, appeared to be reduced, as it\r\ndrew near the hearth of our system, in the enormous proportion of\r\n800,000 to 1. A corresponding expansion accompanied on each occasion its\r\nretirement from the sphere of observation. Similar changes of volume,\r\nthough rarely to the same astounding extent, have been perceived in\r\nother comets. They still remain unexplained; but it can scarcely be\r\ndoubted that they are due to the action of the same energetic internal\r\nforces which reveal themselves in so many splendid and surprising\r\ncometary phenomena.\r\n\r\nAnother question of singular interest was raised by Encke's acute\r\ninquiries into the movements and disturbances of the first known \"comet\r\nof short period.\" He found from the first that its revolutions were\r\nsubject to some influence besides that of gravity. After every possible\r\nallowance had been made for the pulls, now backward, now forward,\r\nexerted upon it by the several planets, there was still a surplus of\r\nacceleration left unaccounted for. Each return to perihelion took place\r\nabout two and a half hours sooner than received theories warranted.\r\nHere, then, was a \"residual phenomenon\" of the utmost promise for the\r\ndisclosure of novel truths. Encke (in accordance with the opinion of\r\nOlbers) explained it as due to the presence in space of some such\r\n\"subtle matter\" as was long ago invoked by Euler[247] to be the agent of\r\neventual destruction for the fair scheme of planetary creation. The\r\napparent anomaly of accounting for an accelerative effect by a retarding\r\ncause disappears when it is considered that any check to the motion of\r\nbodies revolving round a centre of attraction causes them to draw closer\r\nto it, thus shortening their periods and quickening their circulation.\r\nIf space were filled with a resisting medium capable of impeding, even\r\nin the most infinitesimal degree, the swift course of the planets, their\r\norbits should necessarily be, not ellipses, but very close elliptical\r\nspirals along which they would slowly, but inevitably, descend into the\r\nburning lap of the sun. The circumstance that no such tendency can be\r\ntraced in their revolutions by no means sets the question at rest. For\r\nit might well be that an effect totally imperceptible until after the\r\nlapse of countless ages, as regards the solid orbs of our system, might\r\nbe obvious in the movements of bodies like comets of small mass and\r\ngreat bulk; just as a feather or a gauze veil at once yields its motion\r\nto the resistance of the air, while a cannon-ball cuts its way through\r\nwith comparatively slight loss of velocity.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that issues of the most momentous character hang on\r\nthe _time-keeping_ of comets; for plainly all must in some degree suffer\r\nthe same kind of hindrance as Encke's, if the cause of that hindrance be\r\nthe one suggested. None of its congeners, however, show any trace of\r\nsimilar symptoms. True, the late Professor Oppolzer announced,[248] in\r\n1880, that a comet, first seen by Pons in 1819, and rediscovered by\r\nWinnecke in 1858, having a period of 2,052 days (5·6 years), was\r\naccelerated at each revolution precisely in the manner required by\r\nEncke's theory. But M. von Haerdtl's subsequent investigation, the\r\nmaterials for which included numerous observations of the body in\r\nquestion at its return to the sun in 1886, decisively negatived the\r\npresence of any such effect.[249] Moreover, the researches of Von Asten\r\nand Backlund[250] into the movements of Encke's comet revealed a\r\nperplexing circumstance. They confirmed Encke's results for the period\r\ncovered by them, but exhibited the acceleration as having _suddenly\r\ndiminished_ by nearly one-half in 1868. The reality and permanence of\r\nthis change were fully established by observations of the ensuing return\r\nin March, 1885. Some physical alteration of the retarded body seems\r\nindicated; but visual evidence countenances no such assumption. In\r\naspect the comet is no less thin and diffuse than in 1795 or in 1848.\r\n\r\nThe character of the supposed resistance in inter-planetary space has,\r\nit may be remarked, been often misapprehended. What Encke stipulated for\r\nwas not a medium equally diffused throughout the visible universe, such\r\nas the ethereal vehicle of the vibrations of light, but a rare fluid,\r\nrapidly increasing in density towards the sun.[251] This cannot be a\r\nsolar atmosphere, since it is mathematically certain, as Laplace has\r\nshown,[252] that no envelope partaking of the sun's axial rotation can\r\nextend farther from his surface than nine-tenths of the mean distance of\r\nMercury; while physical evidence assures us that the _actual_ depth of\r\nthe solar atmosphere bears a very minute proportion to the _possible_\r\ndepth theoretically assigned to it. That matter, however, not\r\natmospheric in its nature--that is, neither forming one body with the\r\nsun nor altogether aëriform--exists in its neighbourhood, can admit of\r\nno reasonable doubt. The great lens-shaped mass of the zodiacal light,\r\nstretching out at times far beyond the earth's orbit, may indeed be\r\nregarded as an extension of the corona, the streamers of which\r\nthemselves mark the wide diffusion, all round the solar globe, of\r\ngranular or gaseous materials. Yet comets have been known to penetrate\r\nthe sphere occupied by them without perceptible loss of velocity. The\r\nhypothesis, then, of a resisting medium receives at present no\r\ncountenance from the movements of comets, whether of short or of long\r\nperiods.\r\n\r\nAlthough Encke's comet has made thirty-five complete rounds of its orbit\r\nsince its first detection in 1786, it shows no certain signs of decay.\r\nVariations in its brightness are, it is true, conspicuous, but they do\r\nnot proceed continuously.[253]\r\n\r\nThe history of the next known planet-like comet has proved of even more\r\ncurious interest than that of the first. It was discovered by an\r\nAustrian officer named Wilhelm von Biela at Josephstadt in Bohemia,\r\nFebruary 27, 1826, and ten days later by the French astronomer Gambart\r\nat Marseilles. Both observers computed its orbit, showed its remarkable\r\nsimilarity to that traversed by comets visible in 1772 and 1805, and\r\nconnected them together as previous appearances of the body just\r\ndetected by assigning to its revolutions a period of between six and\r\nseven years. The two brief letters conveying these strikingly similar\r\ninferences were printed side by side in the same number of the\r\n_Astronomische Nachrichten_ (No. 94); but Biela's priority in the\r\ndiscovery of the comet was justly recognised by the bestowal upon it of\r\nhis name.\r\n\r\nThe object in question was at no time, subsequently to 1805, visible to\r\nthe naked eye. Its aspect in Sir John Herschel's great reflector on the\r\n23rd of September, 1832, was described by him as that of a \"conspicuous\r\nnebula,\" nearly 3 minutes in diameter. No trace of a tail was\r\ndiscernible. While he was engaged in watching it, a small knot of minute\r\nstars was directly traversed by it, \"and when on the cluster,\" he tells\r\nus,[254] it \"presented the appearance of a nebula resolvable and partly\r\nresolved into stars, the stars of the cluster being visible through the\r\ncomet.\" Yet the depth of cometary matter through which such faint\r\nstellar rays penetrated undimmed, was, near the central parts of the\r\nglobe, not less than 50,000 miles.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to find that this seemingly harmless, and we may perhaps\r\nadd effete body, gave occasion to the first (and not the last) cometary\r\n\"scare\" of an enlightened century. Its orbit, at the descending node,\r\nmay be said to have intersected that of the earth; since, according as\r\nit _bulged in or out_ under the disturbing influence of the planets, the\r\npassage of the comet was affected _inside_ or _outside_ the terrestrial\r\ntrack. Now, certain calculations published by Olbers in 1828[255] showed\r\nthat, on October 29, 1832, a considerable portion of its nebulous\r\nsurroundings would actually sweep over the spot which, a month later,\r\nwould be occupied by our planet. It needed no more to set the popular\r\nimagination in a ferment. Astronomers, after all, could not, by an\r\nalarmed public, be held to be infallible. Their computations, it was\r\naverred, which a trifling oversight would suffice to vitiate, exhibited\r\nclearly enough the danger, but afforded no guarantee of safety from a\r\ncollision, with all the terrific consequences frigidly enumerated by\r\nLaplace. Nor did the panic subside until Arago formally demonstrated\r\nthat the earth and the comet could by no possibility approach within\r\nless than fifty millions of miles.[256]\r\n\r\nThe return of the same body in 1845-46 was marked by an extraordinary\r\ncircumstance. When first seen, November 28, it wore its usual aspect of\r\na faint round patch of cosmical fog; but on December 19, Mr. Hind\r\nnoticed that it had become distorted somewhat into the form of a pear;\r\nand ten days later, it had divided into two separate objects. This\r\nsingular duplication was first perceived at New Haven in America,\r\nDecember 29,[257] by Messrs. Herrick and Bradley, and by Lieutenant\r\nMaury at Washington, January 13, 1846. The earliest British observer of\r\nthe phenomenon (noticed by Wichmann the same evening at Königsberg) was\r\nProfessor Challis. \"I see _two_ comets!\" he exclaimed, putting his eye\r\nto the great equatoreal of the Cambridge Observatory on the night of\r\nJanuary 15; then, distrustful of what his senses had told him, he called\r\nin his judgment to correct their improbable report by resolving one of\r\nthe dubious objects into a hazy star.[258] On the 23rd, however, both\r\nwere again seen by him in unmistakable cometary shape, and until far on\r\nin March (Otto Struve caught a final glimpse of the pair on the 16th of\r\nApril),[259] continued to be watched with equal curiosity and amazement\r\nby astronomers in every part of the northern hemisphere. What Seneca\r\nreproved Ephorus for supposing to have taken place in 373 b.c.--what\r\nPingré blamed Kepler for conjecturing in 1618--had then actually\r\noccurred under the attentive eyes of science in the middle of the\r\nnineteenth century!\r\n\r\nAt a distance from each other of about two-thirds the distance of the\r\nmoon from the earth, the twin comets meantime moved on tranquilly, so\r\nfar, at least, as their course through the heaven was concerned. Their\r\nextreme _lightness_, or the small amount of matter contained in each,\r\ncould not have received a more signal illustration than by the fact that\r\ntheir revolutions round the sun were performed independently; that is to\r\nsay, they travelled side by side without experiencing any appreciable\r\nmutual disturbance, thus plainly showing that at an interval of only\r\n157,250 miles their attractive power was virtually inoperative. Signs of\r\ninternal agitation, however, were not wanting. Each fragment threw out a\r\nshort tail in a direction perpendicular to the line joining their\r\ncentres, and each developed a bright nucleus, although the original\r\ncomet had exhibited neither of these signs of cometary vitality. A\r\nsingular interchange of brilliancy was, besides, observed to take place\r\nbetween the coupled objects, each of which alternately outshone and was\r\noutshone by the other, while an arc of light, apparently proceeding from\r\nthe more lustrous, at times bridged the intervening space. Obviously,\r\nthe gravitational tie, rendered powerless by exiguity of matter, was\r\nhere replaced by some other form of mutual action, the nature of which\r\ncan as yet be dealt with only by conjecture.\r\n\r\nOnce more, in August, 1852, the double comet returned to the\r\nneighbourhood of the sun, but under circumstances not the most\r\nadvantageous for observation. Indeed, the companion was not detected\r\nuntil September 16, when Father Secchi at Rome perceived it to have\r\nincreased its distance from the originating body to a million and a\r\nquarter of miles, or about eight times the average interval at the\r\nformer appearance. Both vanished shortly afterwards, and have never\r\nsince been seen, notwithstanding the eager watch kept for objects of\r\nsuch singular interest, and the accurate knowledge of their track\r\nsupplied by Santini's investigations. A dangerously near approach to\r\nJupiter in 1841 is believed to have occasioned their disruption, and the\r\ndisaggregating process thus started was likely to continue. We can\r\nscarcely doubt that the fate has overtaken them which Newton assigned as\r\nthe end of all cometary existence. _Diffundi tandem et spargi per\r\ncoelos universos._[260]\r\n\r\nBiela's is not the only vanished comet. Brorsen's, discovered at Kiel in\r\n1846, and observed at four subsequent returns, failed unaccountably to\r\nbecome visible in 1890.[261] Yet numerous sentinels were on the alert to\r\nsurprise its approach along a well-ascertained track, traversed in five\r\nand a half years. The object presented from the first a somewhat\r\ntime-worn aspect. It was devoid of tail, or any other kind of appendage;\r\nand the rapid loss of the light acquired during perihelion passage was\r\naccompanied by inordinate expansion of an already tenuous globular mass.\r\nAnother lost or mislaid comet is one found by De Vico at Rome, August\r\n22, 1844. It was expected to return early in 1850, but did not, and has\r\nnever since been seen; unless its re-appearance as E. Swift's comet of\r\n1894 should be ratified by closer inquiry.[262]\r\n\r\nA telescopic comet with a period of 7-1/2 years, discovered November 22,\r\n1843, by M. Faye of the Paris Observatory, formed the subject of a\r\ncharacteristically patient and profound inquiry on the part of\r\nLeverrier, designed to test its suggested identity with Lexell's comet\r\nof 1770. The result was decisive against the hypothesis of Valz, the\r\ndivergences between the orbits of the two bodies being found to increase\r\ninstead of to diminish, as the history of the new-comer was traced\r\nbackward into the previous century.[263] Faye's comet pursues the most\r\nnearly circular path of any similar known object; even at its nearest\r\napproach to the sun it remains farther off than Mars when he is most\r\ndistant from it; and it was proved by the admirable researches of\r\nProfessor Axel Möller,[264] director of the Swedish observatory of Lund,\r\nto exhibit no trace of the action of a resisting medium.\r\n\r\nPeriodical comets are evidently bodies which have each lived through a\r\nchapter of accidents, and a significant hint as to the nature of their\r\nadventures can be gathered from the fact that their aphelia are pretty\r\nclosely grouped about the tracks of the major planets. Halley's, and\r\nfive other comets are thus related to Neptune; three connect themselves\r\nwith Uranus, two with Saturn, above a score with Jupiter. Some form of\r\ndependence is plainly indicated, and the researches of Tisserand,[265]\r\nCallandreau,[266] and Newton[267] of Yale College, leave scarcely a\r\ndoubt that the \"capture-theory\" represents the essential truth in the\r\nmatter. The original parabolic paths of these comets were then changed\r\ninto ellipses by the backward pull of a planet, whose sphere of\r\nattraction they chanced to enter when approaching the sun from outer\r\nspace. Moreover, since a body thus affected should necessarily return at\r\neach revolution to the scene of encounter, the same process of\r\nretardation may, in some cases, have been repeated many times, until the\r\nmore restricted cometary orbits were reduced to their present\r\ndimensions. The prevalence, too, among periodical comets, of direct\r\nmotion, is shown to be inevitable by M. Callandreau's demonstration that\r\nthose travelling in a retrograde direction would, by planetary action,\r\nbe thrown outside the probable range of terrestrial observation. The\r\nscarcity of hyperbolic comets can be similarly explained. They would be\r\ncreated whenever the attractive influence of the disturbing planet was\r\nexerted in a forward or accelerative sense, but could come only by a\r\nrare exception to our notice. The inner planets, including the earth,\r\nhave also unquestionably played their parts in modifying cometary\r\norbits; and Mr. Plummer suggests, with some show of reason, that the\r\ncapture of Encke's comet may be a feat due to Mercury.[268]\r\n\r\nNo _great_ comet appeared between the \"star\" which presided at the birth\r\nof Napoleon and the \"vintage\" comet of 1811. The latter was first\r\ndescribed by Flaugergues at Viviers, March 26, 1811; Wisniewski, at\r\nNeu-Tscherkask in Southern Russia, caught a final glimpse of it, August\r\n17, 1812. Two disappearances in the solar rays as the earth moved round\r\nin its orbit, and two reappearances after conjunction, were included in\r\nthis unprecedentedly long period of visibility of 510 days. This\r\nrelative permanence (so far as the inhabitants of Europe were concerned)\r\nwas due to the high northern latitude attained near perihelion, combined\r\nwith a certain leisureliness of movement along a path everywhere\r\nexternal to that of the earth. The magnificent luminous train of this\r\nbody, on October 15, the day of its nearest terrestrial approach,\r\ncovered an arc of the heavens 23-1/2 degrees in length, corresponding to\r\na real extension of one hundred millions of miles. Its form was\r\ndescribed by Sir William Herschel as that of \"an inverted hollow cone,\"\r\nand its colour as yellowish, strongly contrasted with the bluish-green\r\ntint of the \"head,\" round which it was flung like a transparent veil.\r\nThe planetary disc of the head, 127,000 miles across, appeared to be\r\ncomposed of strongly-condensed nebulous matter; but somewhat\r\neccentrically situated within it was a star-like nucleus of a reddish\r\ntinge, which Herschel presumed to be solid, and ascertained, with his\r\nusual care, to have a diameter of 428 miles. From the total absence of\r\nphases, as well as from the vivacity of its radiance, he confidently\r\ninferred that its light was not borrowed, but inherent.[269]\r\n\r\nThis remarkable apparition formed the subject of a memoir by\r\nOlbers,[270] the striking yet steadily reasoned out suggestions\r\ncontained in which there was at that time no means of following up with\r\nprofit. Only of late has the \"electrical theory,\" of which Zöllner[271]\r\nregarded Olbers as the founder, assumed a definite and measurable form,\r\ncapable of being tested by the touchstone of fact, as knowledge makes\r\nits slow inroads on the fundamental mystery of the physical universe.\r\n\r\nThe paraboloidal shape of the bright envelope separated by a dark\r\ninterval from the head of the great comet of 1811, and constituting, as\r\nit were, the _root_ of its tail, seemed to the astronomer of Bremen to\r\nreveal the presence of a double repulsion; the expelled vapours\r\naccumulating where the two forces, solar and cometary, balanced each\r\nother, and being then swept backwards in a huge train. He accordingly\r\ndistinguished three classes of these bodies:--First, comets which\r\ndevelop _no_ matter subject to solar repulsion. These have no tails, and\r\nare probably mere nebulosities, without solid nuclei. Secondly, comets\r\nwhich are acted upon by solar repulsion _only_, and consequently throw\r\nout no emanations _towards_ the sun. Of this kind was a bright comet\r\nvisible in 1807.[272] Thirdly, comets like that of 1811, giving evidence\r\nof action of both kinds. These are distinguished by a dark _hoop_\r\nencompassing the head and dividing it from the luminous envelope, as\r\nwell as by an obscure caudal axis, resulting from the hollow, cone-like\r\nstructure of the tail.\r\n\r\nAgain, the ingenious view subsequently propounded by M. Bredikhin as to\r\nthe connection between the _form_ of these appendages and the _kind_ of\r\nmatter composing them, was very clearly anticipated by Olbers. The\r\namount of tail-curvature, he pointed out, depends in each case upon the\r\nproportion borne by the velocity of the ascending particles to that of\r\nthe comet in its orbit; the swifter the outrush, the straighter the\r\nresulting tail. But the velocity of the ascending particles varies with\r\nthe energy of their repulsion by the sun, and this again, it may be\r\npresumed, with their quality. Thus multiple tails are developed when the\r\nsame comet throws off, as it approaches perihelion, specifically\r\ndistinct substances. The long, straight ray which proceeded from the\r\ncomet of 1807, for example, was doubtless made up of particles subject\r\nto a much more vigorous solar repulsion than those formed into the\r\nshorter curved emanation issuing from it nearly in the same direction.\r\nIn the comet of 1811 he calculated that the particles expelled from the\r\nhead travelled to the remote extremity of the tail in eleven minutes,\r\nindicating by this enormous rapidity of movement (comparable to that of\r\nthe transmission of light) the action of a force much more powerful than\r\nthe opposing one of gravity. The not uncommon phenomena of multiple\r\nenvelopes, on the other hand, he explained as due to the varying amounts\r\nof repulsion exercised by the nucleus itself on the different kinds of\r\nmatter developed from it.\r\n\r\nThe movements and perturbations of the comet of 1811 were no less\r\nprofoundly studied by Argelander than its physical constitution by\r\nOlbers. The orbit which he assigned to it is of such vast dimensions as\r\nto require no less that 3,065 years for the completion of its circuit;\r\nand to carry the body describing it at each revolution to fourteen times\r\nthe distance from the sun of the frigid Neptune. Thus, when it last\r\nvisited our neighbourhood, Achilles may have gazed on its imposing train\r\nas he lay on the sands all night bewailing the loss of Patroclus; and\r\nwhen it returns, it will perhaps be to shine upon the ruins of empires\r\nand civilizations still deep buried among the secrets of the coming\r\ntime.[273]\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of June, 1819, while the head of a comet passed across the\r\nface of the sun, the earth was in all probability involved in its tail.\r\nBut of this remarkable double event nothing was known until more than a\r\nmonth later, when the fact of its past occurrence emerged from the\r\ncalculations of Olbers.[274] Nor had the comet itself been generally\r\nvisible previous to the first days of July. Several observers, however,\r\non the publication of these results, brought forward accounts of\r\nsingular spots perceived by them upon the sun at the time of the\r\ntransit, and an original drawing of one of them, by Pastorff of\r\nBuchholtz, has been preserved. This undoubtedly authentic\r\ndelineation[275] represents a round nebulous object with a _bright_ spot\r\nin the centre, of decidedly cometary aspect, and not in the least like\r\nan ordinary solar \"macula.\" Mr. Hind,[276] nevertheless, showed its\r\nposition on the sun to be irreconcilable with that which the comet must\r\nhave occupied; and Mr. Ranyard's discovery of a similar smaller drawing\r\nby the same author, dated May 26, 1828,[277] reduces to evanescence the\r\nprobability of its connection with that body. Indeed, recent experience\r\nrenders very doubtful the possibility of such an observation.\r\n\r\nThe return of Halley's comet in 1835 was looked forward to as an\r\nopportunity for testing the truth of floating cometary theories, and did\r\nnot altogether disappoint expectation. As early as 1817, its movements\r\nand disturbances since 1759 were proposed by the Turin Academy of\r\nSciences as the subject of a prize ultimately awarded to Baron\r\nDamoiseau. Pontécoulant was adjudged a similar distinction by the Paris\r\nAcademy in 1829; while Rosenberger's calculations were rewarded with the\r\ngold medal of the Royal Astronomical Society.[278]\r\n\r\nThey were verified by the detection at Rome, August 6, 1835, of a nearly\r\ncircular misty object not far from the predicted place of the comet. It\r\nwas not, however, until the middle of September that it began to throw\r\nout a tail, which by the 15th of October had attained a length of about\r\n24 degrees (on the 19th, at Madras, it extended to fully 30),[279] the\r\nhead showing to the naked eye as a reddish star rather brighter than\r\nAldebaran or Antares.[280] Some curious phenomena accompanied the\r\nprocess of tail-formation. An outrush of luminous matter, resembling in\r\nshape a partially opened fan, issued from the nucleus _towards_ the sun,\r\nand at a certain point, like smoke driven before a high wind, was\r\nvehemently swept backwards in a prolonged train. The appearance of the\r\ncomet at this time was compared by Bessel,[281] who watched it with\r\nminute attention, to that of a blazing rocket. He made the singular\r\nobservation that this fan of light, which seemed the source of supply\r\nfor the tail, oscillated like a pendulum to and fro across a line\r\njoining the sun and nucleus, in a period of 4-3/5 days; and he was\r\nunable to escape from the conclusion[282] that a repulsive force, about\r\ntwice as powerful as the attractive force of gravity, was concerned in\r\nthe production of these remarkable effects. Nor did he hesitate to recur\r\nto the analogy of magnetic polarity, or to declare, still more\r\nemphatically than Olbers, \"the emission of the tail to be a purely\r\nelectrical phenomenon.\"[283]\r\n\r\nThe transformations undergone by this body were almost as strange and\r\ncomplete as those which affected the brigands in Dante's _Inferno_. When\r\nfirst seen, it wore the aspect of a nebula; later it put on the\r\ndistinctive garb of a comet; it next appeared as a star; finally, it\r\ndilated, first in a spherical, then in a paraboloidal form, until May 5,\r\n1836, when it vanished from Herschel's observation at Feldhausen as if\r\nby melting into adjacent space from the excessive diffusion of its\r\nlight. A very uncommon circumstance in its development was that it lost\r\nall trace of tail _previous_ to its arrival at perihelion on the 16th of\r\nNovember. Nor did it begin to recover its elongated shape for more than\r\ntwo months afterwards. On the 23rd of January, Boguslawski perceived it\r\nas a star of the sixth magnitude, _without measurable disc_.[284] Only\r\ntwo nights later, Maclear, director of the Cape Observatory, found the\r\nhead to be 131 seconds across.[285] And so rapidly did the augmentation\r\nof size progress, that Sir John Herschel estimated the actual bulk of\r\nthis singular object to have increased forty-fold in the ensuing week.\r\n\"I can hardly doubt,\" he remarks, \"that the comet was fairly evaporated\r\nin perihelio by the heat, and resolved into transparent vapour, and is\r\nnow in process of rapid condensation and re-precipitation on the\r\nnucleus.\"[286] A plausible, but no longer admissible, interpretation of\r\nthis still unexplained phenomenon. The next return of this body, which\r\nwill be considerably accelerated by Jupiter's influence, is expected to\r\ntake place in 1910.[287]\r\n\r\nBy means of an instrument devised to test the quality of light, Arago\r\nobtained decisive evidence that some at least of the radiance proceeding\r\nfrom Halley's comet was derived by reflection from the sun.[288]\r\nIndications of the same kind had been afforded[289] by the comet which\r\nsuddenly appeared above the north-western horizon of Paris, July 3,\r\n1819, after having enveloped (as already stated) our terrestrial abode\r\nin its filmy appendages; but the \"polariscope\" had not then reached the\r\nperfection subsequently given to it, and its testimony was accordingly\r\nfar less reliable than in 1835. Such experiments, however, are in\r\nreality more beautiful and ingenious than instructive, since ignited as\r\nwell as obscure bodies possess the power of throwing back light incident\r\nupon them, and will consequently transmit to us from the neighbourhood\r\nof the sun rays partly direct, partly reflected, of which a certain\r\nproportion will exhibit the peculiarity known as polarisation.\r\n\r\nThe most brilliant comets of the century were suddenly rivalled if not\r\nsurpassed by the extraordinary object which blazed out beside the sun,\r\nFebruary 28, 1843. It was simultaneously perceived in Mexico and the\r\nUnited States, in Southern Europe, and at sea off the Cape of Good Hope,\r\nwhere the passengers on board the _Owen Glendower_ were amazed by the\r\nsight of a \"short, dagger-like object,\" closely following the sun\r\ntowards the western horizon.[290] At Florence, Amici found its distance\r\nfrom the sun's centre at noon to be only 1° 23'; and spectators at Parma\r\nwere able, when sheltered from the direct glare of mid-day, to trace the\r\ntail to a length of four or five degrees. The full dimensions of this\r\nastonishing appurtenance began to be disclosed a few days later. On the\r\n3rd of March it measured 25°, and on the 11th, at Calcutta, Mr. Clerihew\r\nobserved a second streamer, nearly twice as long as the first, and\r\nmaking an angle with it of 18°, to have been emitted in a single day.\r\nThis rapidity of projection, Sir John Herschel remarked, \"conveys an\r\nastounding impression of the intensity of the forces at work.\" \"It is\r\nclear,\" he continued, \"that _if we have to deal here with matter, such\r\nas we conceive it_--viz., _possessing inertia--at all_, it must be under\r\nthe dominion of forces incomparably more energetic than gravitation, and\r\nquite of a different nature.\"[291]\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of March a silvery ray, some 40° long and slightly curved at\r\nits extremity, shone out above the sunset clouds in this country. No\r\nprevious intimation had been received of the possibility of such an\r\napparition, and even astronomers--no lightning messages across the seas\r\nbeing as yet possible--were perplexed. The nature of the phenomenon,\r\nindeed, soon became evident, but the wonder of it did not diminish with\r\nthe study of its attendant circumstances. Never before, within\r\nastronomical memory, had our system been traversed by a body pursuing\r\nsuch an adventurous career. The closest analogy was offered by the great\r\ncomet of 1680 (Newton's), which rushed past the sun at a distance of\r\nonly 144,000 miles; but even this--on the cosmical scale--scarcely\r\nperceptible interval was reduced nearly one-half in the case we are now\r\nconcerned with. The centre of the comet of 1843 approached the\r\nformidable luminary within 78,000 miles, leaving, it is estimated, a\r\nclear space of not more than 32,000 between the surfaces of the bodies\r\nbrought into such perilous proximity. The escape of the wanderer was,\r\nhowever, secured by the extraordinary rapidity of its flight. It swept\r\npast perihelion at a rate--366 miles a second--which, if continued,\r\nwould have carried it right round the sun in _two hours_; and in only\r\neleven minutes more than that short period it actually described half\r\nthe _curvature_ of its orbit--an arc of 180°--although in travelling\r\nover the remaining half many hundreds of sluggish years will doubtless\r\nbe consumed.\r\n\r\nThe behaviour of this comet may be regarded as an _experimentum crucis_\r\nas to the nature of tails. For clearly no fixed appendage many millions\r\nof miles in length could be whirled like a brandished sabre from one\r\nside of the sun to the other in 131 minutes. Cometary trains are then,\r\nas Olbers rightly conceived them to be, emanations, not\r\nappendages--inconceivably rapid outflows of highly rarefied matter, the\r\ngreater part, if not all, of which becomes permanently detached from the\r\nnucleus.\r\n\r\nThat of the comet of 1843 reached, about the time that it became visible\r\nin this country, the extravagant length of 200 millions of miles.[292]\r\nIt was narrow, and bounded by nearly parallel and nearly rectilinear\r\nlines, resembling--to borrow a comparison of Aristotle's--a \"road\"\r\nthrough the constellations; and after the 3rd of March showed no trace\r\nof hollowness, the axis being, in fact, rather brighter than the edges.\r\nDistinctly perceptible in it were those singular aurora-like\r\ncoruscations which gave to the \"tresses\" of Charles V.'s comet the\r\nappearance--as Cardan described it--of \"a torch agitated by the wind,\"\r\nand have not unfrequently been observed to characterise other similar\r\nobjects. A consideration first adverted to by Olbers proves these to\r\noriginate in our own atmosphere. For owing to the great difference in\r\nthe distances from the earth of the origin and extremity of such vast\r\neffluxes, the light proceeding from their various parts is transmitted\r\nto our eyes in notably different intervals of time. Consequently a\r\nluminous undulation, even though propagated instantaneously from end to\r\nend of a comet's tail, would appear to us to occupy many minutes in its\r\nprogress. But the coruscations in question pass as swiftly as a falling\r\nstar. They are, then, of terrestrial production.\r\n\r\nPeriods of the utmost variety were by different computators assigned to\r\nthe body, which arrived at perihelion, February 27, 1843, at 9.47 p.m.\r\nProfessor Hubbard of Washington found that it required 533 years to\r\ncomplete a revolution; MM. Laugier and Mauvais of Paris considered the\r\ntrue term to be 35;[293] Clausen looked for its return at the end of\r\nbetween six and seven. A recent discussion[294] by Professor Kreutz of\r\nall the available data gives a probable period of 512 years for this\r\nbody, and precludes its hypothetical identity with the comet of 1668,\r\nknown as the \"Spina\" of Cassini.\r\n\r\nIt may now be asked, what were the conclusions regarding the nature of\r\ncomets drawn by astronomers from the considerable amount of novel\r\nexperience accumulated during the first half of this century? The first\r\nand best assured was that the matter composing them is in a state of\r\nextreme tenuity. Numerous and trustworthy observations showed that the\r\nfeeblest rays of light might traverse some hundreds of thousands of\r\nmiles of their substance, even where it was apparently most condensed,\r\nwithout being perceptibly weakened. Nay, instances were recorded in\r\nwhich stars were said to have gained in brightness from the\r\nprocess![295] On the 24th of June, 1825, Olbers[296] saw the comet then\r\nvisible all but obliterated by the central passage of a star too small\r\nto be distinguished with the naked eye, its own light remaining wholly\r\nunchanged. A similar effect was noted December 1, 1811, when the great\r\ncomet of that year approached so close to Altair, the _lucida_ of the\r\nEagle, that the star seemed to be transformed into the nucleus of the\r\ncomet.[297] Even the central blaze of Halley's comet in 1835 was\r\npowerless to impede the passage of stellar rays. Struve[298] observed at\r\nDorpat, on September 17, an all but central occultation; Glaisher[299]\r\none (so far as he could ascertain) absolutely so eight days later at\r\nCambridge. In neither case was there any appreciable diminution of the\r\nstar's light. Again, on the 11th of October, 1847, Mr. Dawes,[300] an\r\nexceptionally keen observer, distinctly saw a star of the tenth\r\nmagnitude through the exact centre of a comet discovered on the first of\r\nthat month by Maria Mitchell of Nantucket.\r\n\r\nExamples, on the other hand, are not wanting of the diminution of\r\nstellar light under similar circumstances;[301] and we meet two alleged\r\ninstances of the vanishing of a star behind a comet. Wartmann of Geneva\r\nobserved the first, November 28, 1828;[302] but his instrument was\r\ndefective, and the eclipsing body, Encke's comet, has shown itself\r\notherwise perfectly translucent. The second case of occultation occurred\r\nSeptember 13, 1890, when an eleventh magnitude star was stated to have\r\ncompletely disappeared during the transit over it of Denning's\r\ncomet.[303]\r\n\r\nFrom the failure to detect any effects of refraction in the light of\r\nstars occulted by comets, it was inferred (though, as we know now,\r\nerroneously) that their composition is rather that of dust than that of\r\nvapour; that they consist not of any continuous substance, but of\r\ndiscrete solid particles, very finely divided and widely scattered. In\r\nconformity with this view was the known smallness of their masses.\r\nLaplace had shown that if the amount of matter forming Lexell's comet\r\nhad been as much as 1/5000 of that contained in our globe, the effect of\r\nits attraction, on the occasion of its approach within 1,438,000 miles\r\nof the earth, July 1, 1770, must have been apparent in the lengthening\r\nof the year. And that some comets, at any rate, possess masses\r\nimmeasurably below this maximum value was clearly proved by the\r\nundisturbed parallel march of the two fragments of Biela's in 1846.\r\n\r\nBut the discovery in this branch most distinctive of the period under\r\nreview is that of \"short period\" comets, of which four[304] were known\r\nin 1850. These, by the character of their movements, serve as a link\r\nbetween the planetary and cometary worlds, and by the nature of their\r\nconstruction, seem to mark a stage in cometary decay. For that comets\r\nare rather transitory agglomerations, than permanent products of\r\ncosmical manufacture, appeared to be demonstrated by the division and\r\ndisappearance of one amongst their number, as well as by the singular\r\nand rapid changes in appearance undergone by many, and the seemingly\r\nirrevocable diffusion of their substance visible in nearly all. They\r\nmight then be defined, according to the ideas respecting them prevalent\r\nfifty years ago, as bodies unconnected by origin with the solar system,\r\nbut encountered, and to some extent appropriated, by it in its progress\r\nthrough space, owing their visibility in great part, if not altogether,\r\nto light reflected from the sun, and their singular and striking forms\r\nto the action of repulsive forces emanating from him, the penalty of\r\ntheir evanescent splendour being paid in gradual waste and final\r\ndissipation and extinction.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 241: _Allgemeine Geographische Ephemeriden_, vol. iv., p.\r\n287.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 242: _Astr.

Indeed, the bare\r\nacquaintance with _what_ has been achieved, without any corresponding\r\nknowledge of _how_ it has been achieved, supplies food for barren wonder\r\nrather than for fruitful and profitable thought. Ideas advance most\r\nreadily along the solid ground of practical reality, and often find true\r\nsublimity while laying aside empty marvels. Progress is the result, not\r\nso much of sudden flights of genius, as of sustained, patient, often\r\ncommonplace endeavour; and the true lesson of scientific history lies in\r\nthe close connection which it discloses between the most brilliant\r\ndevelopments of knowledge and the faithful accomplishment of his daily\r\ntask by each individual thinker and worker.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to fill a volume with the detailed account of the long\r\nsuccession of optical and mechanical improvements by means of which the\r\nobservation of the heavens has been brought to its present degree of\r\nperfection; but we must here content ourselves with a summary sketch of\r\nthe chief amongst them. The first place in our consideration is\r\nnaturally claimed by the telescope.\r\n\r\nThis marvellous instrument, we need hardly remind our readers, is of two\r\ndistinct kinds--that in which light is gathered together into a focus by\r\n_refraction_, and that in which the same end is attained by\r\n_reflection_. The image formed is in each case viewed through a\r\nmagnifying lens, or combination of lenses, called the eye-piece. Not for\r\nabove a century after the \"optic glasses\" invented or stumbled upon by\r\nthe spectacle-maker of Middelburg (1608) had become diffused over\r\nEurope, did the reflecting telescope come, even in England, the place of\r\nits birth, into general use. Its principle (a sufficiently obvious one)\r\nhad indeed been suggested by Mersenne as early as 1639;[305] James\r\nGregory in 1663[306] described in detail a mode of embodying that\r\nprinciple in a practical shape; and Newton, adopting an original system\r\nof construction, actually produced in 1668 a tiny speculum, one inch\r\nacross, by means of which the apparent distance of objects was reduced\r\nthirty-nine times. Nevertheless, the exorbitantly long tubeless\r\nrefractors, introduced by Huygens, maintained their reputation until\r\nHadley exhibited to the Royal Society, January 12, 1721,[307] a\r\nreflector of six inches aperture, and sixty-two in focal length, which\r\nrivalled in performance, and of course indefinitely surpassed in\r\nmanageability, one of the \"aerial\" kind of 123 feet.\r\n\r\nThe concave-mirror system now gained a decided ascendant, and was\r\nbrought to unexampled perfection by James Short of Edinburgh during the\r\nyears 1732-68. Its resources were, however, first fully developed by\r\nWilliam Herschel. The energy and inventiveness of this extraordinary man\r\nmarked an epoch wherever they were applied. His ardent desire to measure\r\nand gauge the stupendous array of worlds which his specula revealed to\r\nhim, made him continually intent upon adding to their \"space-penetrating\r\npower\" by increasing their light-gathering surface. These, as he was the\r\nfirst to explain,[308] are in a constant proportion one to the other.\r\nFor a telescope with twice the linear aperture of another will collect\r\nfour times as much light, and will consequently disclose an object four\r\ntimes as faint as could be seen with the first, or, what comes to the\r\nsame, an object equally bright at twice the distance. In other words, it\r\nwill possess double the space-penetrating power of the smaller\r\ninstrument. Herschel's great mirrors--the first examples of the giant\r\ntelescopes of modern times--were then primarily engines for extending\r\nthe bounds of the visible universe; and from the sublimity of this\r\n\"final cause\" was derived the vivid enthusiasm which animated his\r\nefforts to success.\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that the seven-foot telescope constructed by him in\r\n1775--that is within little more than a year after his experiments in\r\nshaping and polishing metal had begun--already exceeded in effective\r\npower any work by an earlier optician; and both his skill and his\r\nambition rapidly developed. His efforts culminated, after mirrors of\r\nten, twenty, and thirty feet focal length had successively left his\r\nhands, in the gigantic forty-foot, completed August 28, 1789. It was the\r\nfirst reflector in which only a single mirror was employed. In the\r\n\"Gregorian\" form, the focussed rays are, by a second reflection from a\r\nsmall concave[309] mirror, thrown _straight back_ through a central\r\naperture in the larger one, behind which the eye-piece is fixed. The\r\nobject under examination is thus seen in the natural direction. The\r\n\"Newtonian,\" on the other hand, shows the object in a line of sight at\r\nright angles to the true one, the light collected by the speculum being\r\ndiverted to one side of the tube by the interposition of a small plane\r\nmirror, situated at an angle of 45° to the axis of the instrument. Upon\r\nthese two systems Herschel worked until 1787, when, becoming convinced\r\nof the supreme importance of economising light (necessarily wasted by\r\nthe second reflection), he laid aside the small mirror of his forty-foot\r\nthen in course of construction, and turned it into a \"front-view\"\r\nreflector. This was done--according to the plan proposed by Lemaire in\r\n1732--by slightly inclining the speculum so as to enable the image\r\nformed by it to be viewed with an eye-glass fixed at the upper margin of\r\nthe tube. The observer thus stood with his back turned to the object he\r\nwas engaged in scrutinising.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of the increased brilliancy afforded by this modification\r\nwere strikingly illustrated by the discovery, August 28 and September\r\n17, 1789, of the two Saturnian satellites nearest the ring.\r\nNevertheless, the monster telescope of Slough cannot be said to have\r\nrealised the sanguine expectations of its constructor. The occasions on\r\nwhich it could be usefully employed were found to be extremely rare. It\r\nwas injuriously affected by every change of temperature. The great\r\nweight (25 cwt.) of a speculum four feet in diameter rendered it\r\npeculiarly liable to distortion. With all imaginable care, the delicate\r\nlustre of its surface could not be preserved longer than two years,[310]\r\nwhen the difficult process of repolishing had to be undertaken. It was\r\naccordingly never used after 1811, when, having _gone blind_ from damp,\r\nit lapsed by degrees into the condition of a museum inmate.\r\n\r\nThe exceedingly high magnifying powers employed by Herschel constituted\r\na novelty in optical astronomy, to which he attached great importance.\r\nThe work of ordinary observation would, however, be hindered rather than\r\nhelped by them. The attempt to increase in this manner the efficacy of\r\nthe telescope is speedily checked by atmospheric, to say nothing of\r\nother difficulties. Precisely in the same proportion as an object is\r\nmagnified, the disturbances of the medium through which it is seen are\r\nmagnified also. Even on the clearest and most tranquil nights, the air\r\nis never for a moment really still. The rays of light traversing it are\r\ncontinually broken by minute fluctuations of refractive power caused by\r\nchanges of temperature and pressure, and the currents which these\r\nengender. With such luminous quiverings and waverings the astronomer has\r\nalways more or less to reckon; their absence is simply a question of\r\ndegree; if sufficiently magnified, they are at all times capable of\r\nrendering observation impossible.\r\n\r\nThus, such powers as 3,000, 4,000, 5,000, even 6,652,[311] which\r\nHerschel now and again applied to his great telescopes, must, save on\r\nthe rarest occasions, prove an impediment rather than an aid to vision.\r\nThey were, however, used by him only for special purposes,\r\nexperimentally, not systematically, and with the clearest discrimination\r\nof their advantages and drawbacks. It is obvious that perfectly\r\ndifferent ends are subserved by increasing the _aperture_ and by\r\nincreasing the _power_ of a telescope. In the one case, a larger\r\nquantity of light is captured and concentrated; in the other, the same\r\namount is distributed over a wider area. A diminution of brilliancy in\r\nthe image accordingly attends, _coeteris paribus_, upon each\r\naugmentation of its apparent size. For this reason, such faint objects\r\nas nebulæ are most successfully observed with moderate powers applied to\r\ninstruments of a great capacity for light, the details of their\r\nstructure actually disappearing when highly magnified. With stellar\r\ngroups the reverse is the case. Stars cannot be magnified, simply\r\nbecause they are too remote to have any sensible dimensions; but the\r\nspace between them can. It was thus for the purpose of dividing very\r\nclose double stars that Herschel increased to such an unprecedented\r\nextent the magnifying capabilities of his instruments; and to this\r\nimprovement incidentally the discovery of Uranus, March 13, 1781,[312]\r\nwas due. For by the examination with strong lenses of an object which,\r\neven with a power of 227, presented a suspicious appearance, he was able\r\nat once to pronounce its disc to be real, not merely \"spurious,\" and so\r\nto distinguish it unerringly from the crowd of stars amidst which it was\r\nmoving.\r\n\r\nWhile the reflecting telescope was astonishing the world by its rapid\r\ndevelopment in the hands of Herschel, its unpretending rival was slowly\r\nmaking its way towards the position which the future had in store for\r\nit. The great obstacle which long stood in the way of the improvement of\r\nrefractors was the defect known as \"chromatic aberration.\" This is due\r\nto no other cause than that which produces the rainbow and the\r\nspectrum--the separation, or \"dispersion\" in their passage through a\r\nrefracting medium, of the variously coloured rays composing a beam of\r\nwhite light. In an ordinary lens there is no common point of\r\nconcentration; each colour has its own separate focus; and the resulting\r\nimage, formed by the superposition of as many images as there are hues\r\nin the spectrum, is indefinitely terminated with a tinted border,\r\neminently baffling to exactness of observation.\r\n\r\nThe extravagantly long telescopes of the seventeenth century were\r\ndesigned to _avoid_ this evil (as well as another source of indistinct\r\nvision in the spherical shape of lenses); but no attempt to _remedy_ it\r\nwas made until an Essex gentleman succeeded, in 1733, in so combining\r\nlenses of flint and crown glass as to produce refraction without\r\ncolour.[313] Mr. Chester More Hall was, however, equally indifferent to\r\nfame and profit, and took no pains to make his invention public. The\r\n_effective_ discovery of the achromatic telescope was, accordingly,\r\nreserved for John Dollond, whose method of correcting at the same time\r\nchromatic and spherical aberration was laid before the Royal Society in\r\n1758. Modern astronomy may be said to have been thereby rendered\r\npossible. Refractors have always been found better suited than\r\nreflectors to the ordinary work of observatories. They are, so to speak,\r\nof a more robust, as well as of a more plastic nature. They suffer less\r\nfrom vicissitudes of temperature and climate. They retain their\r\nefficiency with fewer precautions and under more trying circumstances.\r\nAbove all, they co-operate more readily with mechanical appliances, and\r\nlend themselves with far greater facility to purposes of exact\r\nmeasurement.\r\n\r\nA practical difficulty, however, impeded the realisation of the\r\nbrilliant prospects held out by Dollond's invention. It was found\r\nimpossible to procure flint-glass, such as was needed for optical\r\nuse--that is, of perfectly homogeneous quality--except in fragments of\r\ninsignificant size. Discs of more than two or three inches in diameter\r\nwere of extreme rarity; and the crushing excise duty imposed upon the\r\narticle by the financial unwisdom of the Government, both limited its\r\nproduction, and, by rendering experiments too costly for repetition,\r\nbarred its improvement.\r\n\r\nUp to this time, Great Britain had left foreign competitors far behind\r\nin the instrumental department of astronomy. The quadrants and circles\r\nof Bird, Cary and Ramsden were unapproached abroad. The reflecting\r\ntelescope came into existence and reached maturity on British soil. The\r\nrefracting telescope was cured of its inherent vices by British\r\ningenuity. But with the opening of the nineteenth century, the almost\r\nunbroken monopoly of skill and contrivance which our countrymen had\r\nsucceeded in establishing was invaded, and British workmen had to be\r\ncontent to exchange a position of supremacy for one of at least partial\r\ntemporary inferiority.\r\n\r\nSomewhat about the time that Herschel set about polishing his first\r\nspeculum, Pierre Louis Guinand, a Swiss artisan, living near\r\nChaux-de-Fonds, in the canton of Neuchâtel, began to grind spectacles\r\nfor his own use, and was thence led on to the rude construction of\r\ntelescopes by fixing lenses in pasteboard tubes. The sight of an England\r\nachromatic stirred a higher ambition, and he took the first opportunity\r\nof procuring some flint glass from England (then the only source of\r\nsupply), with the design of imitating an instrument the full\r\ncapabilities of which he was destined to be the humble means of\r\ndeveloping. The English glass proving of inferior quality, he conceived\r\nthe possibility, unaided and ignorant of the art as he was, of himself\r\nmaking better, and spent seven years (1784-90) in fruitless experiments\r\ndirected to that end. Failure only stimulated him to enlarge their\r\nscale. He bought some land near Les Brenets, constructed upon it a\r\nfurnace capable of melting two quintals of glass, and reducing himself\r\nand his family to the barest necessaries of life, he poured his earnings\r\n(he at this time made bells for repeaters) unstintingly into his\r\ncrucibles.[314] His undaunted resolution triumphed. In 1799 he carried\r\nto Paris and there showed to Lalande several discs of flawless crystal\r\nfour to six inches in diameter. Lalande advised him to keep his secret,\r\nbut in 1805 he was induced to remove to Munich, where he became the\r\ninstructor of the immortal Fraunhofer. His return to Les Brenets in 1814\r\nwas signalised by the discovery of an ingenious mode of removing\r\nstriated portions of glass by breaking and re-soldering the product of\r\neach melting, and he eventually attained to the manufacture of perfect\r\ndiscs up to 18 inches in diameter. An object-glass for which he had\r\nfurnished the material to Cauchoix, procured him, in 1823, a royal\r\ninvitation to settle in Paris; but he was no longer equal to the change,\r\nand died at the scene of his labours, February 13 following.\r\n\r\nThis same lens (12 inches across) was afterwards purchased by Sir James\r\nSouth, and the first observation made with it, February 13, 1830,\r\ndisclosed to Sir John Herschel the sixth minute star in the central\r\ngroup of the Orion nebula, known as the \"trapezium.\"[315] Bequeathed by\r\nSouth to Trinity College, Dublin, it was employed at the Dunsink\r\nObservatory by Brünnow and Ball in their investigations of stellar\r\nparallax. A still larger objective (of nearly 14 inches) made of\r\nGuinand's glass was secured in Paris, about the same time, by Mr. Edward\r\nCooper of Markree Castle, Ireland. The peculiarity of the method\r\ndiscovered at Les Brenets resided in the manipulation, not in the\r\nquality of the ingredients; the secret, that is to say, was not\r\nchemical, but mechanical.[316] It was communicated by Henry Guinand (a\r\nson of the inventor) to Bontemps, one of the directors of the glassworks\r\nat Choisy-le-Roi, and by him transmitted to Messrs. Chance of\r\nBirmingham, with whom he entered into partnership when the revolutionary\r\ntroubles of 1848 obliged him to quit his native country. The celebrated\r\nAmerican opticians, Alvan Clark & Sons, derived from the Birmingham firm\r\nthe materials for some of their early telescopes, notably the 19-inch\r\nChicago and 26-inch Washington equatoreals; but the discs for the great\r\nLick refractor, and others shaped by them in recent years, have been\r\nsupplied by Feil of Paris.\r\n\r\nTwo distinguished amateurs, meanwhile, were preparing to reassert on\r\nbehalf of reflecting instruments their claim to the place of honour in\r\nthe van of astronomical discovery. Of Mr. Lassell's specula something\r\nhas already been said.[317] They were composed of an alloy of copper and\r\ntin, with a minute proportion of arsenic (after the example of\r\nNewton[318]), and were remarkable for perfection of figure and\r\nbrilliancy of surface.\r\n\r\nThe capabilities of the Newtonian plan were developed still more\r\nfully--it might almost be said to the uttermost--by the enterprise of an\r\nIrish nobleman. William Parsons, known as Lord Oxmantown until 1841,\r\nwhen, on his father's death, he succeeded to the title of Earl of Rosse,\r\nwas born at York, June 17, 1800. His public duties began before his\r\neducation was completed. He was returned to Parliament as member for\r\nKing's County while still an undergraduate at Oxford, and continued to\r\nrepresent the same constituency for thirteen years (1821-34). From 1845\r\nuntil his death, which took place, October 31, 1867, he sat, silent but\r\nassiduous, in the House of Lords as an Irish representative peer; he\r\nheld the not unlaborious post of President of the Royal Society from\r\n1849 to 1854; presided over the meeting of the British Association at\r\nCork in 1843, and was elected Vice-Chancellor of Dublin University in\r\n1862. In addition to these extensive demands upon his time and thoughts,\r\nwere those derived from his position as practically the feudal chief of\r\na large body of tenantry in times of great and anxious responsibility,\r\nto say nothing of the more genial claims of an unstinted hospitality.\r\nYet, while neglecting no public or private duty, this model nobleman\r\nfound leisure to render to science services so conspicuous as to entitle\r\nhis name to a lasting place in its annals.\r\n\r\nHe early formed the design of reaching the limits of the attainable in\r\nenlarging the powers of the telescope, and the qualities of his mind\r\nconspired with the circumstances of his fortune to render the design a\r\nfeasible one. From refractors it was obvious that no such vast and rapid\r\nadvance could be expected. English glass-manufacture was still in a\r\nbackward state. So late as 1839, Simms (successor to the distinguished\r\ninstrumentalist Edward Troughton) reported a specimen of crystal\r\nscarcely 7-1/2 inches in diameter, and perfect only over six, to be\r\nunique in the history of English glass-making.[319] Yet at that time the\r\nfifteen-inch achromatic of Pulkowa had already left the workshop of\r\nFraunhofer's successors at Munich. It was not indeed until 1845, when\r\nthe impost which had so long hampered their efforts was removed, that\r\nthe optical artists of these islands were able to compete on equal terms\r\nwith their rivals on the Continent. In the case of reflectors, however,\r\nthere seemed no insurmountable obstacle to an almost unlimited increase\r\nof light-gathering capacity; and it was here, after some unproductive\r\nexperiments with fluid lenses, that Lord Oxmantown concentrated his\r\nenergies.\r\n\r\nHe had to rely entirely on his own invention, and to earn his own\r\nexperience. James Short had solved the problem of giving to metallic\r\nsurfaces a perfect parabolic figure (the only one by which parallel\r\nincident rays can be brought to an exact focus); but so jealous was he\r\nof his secret, that he caused all his tools to be burnt before his\r\ndeath;[320] nor was anything known of the processes by which Herschel\r\nhad achieved his astonishing results. Moreover, Lord Oxmantown had no\r\nskilled workmen to assist him. His implements, both animate and\r\ninanimate, had to be formed by himself. Peasants taken from the plough\r\nwere educated by him into efficient mechanics and engineers. The\r\ndelicate and complex machinery needed in operations of such hairbreadth\r\nnicety as his enterprise involved, the steam-engine which was to set it\r\nin motion, at times the very crucibles in which his specula were cast,\r\nissued from his own workshops.\r\n\r\nIn 1827 experiments on the composition of speculum-metal were set on\r\nfoot, and the first polishing-machine ever driven by steam-power was\r\ncontrived in 1828. But twelve arduous years of struggle with recurring\r\ndifficulties passed before success began to dawn. A material less\r\ntractable than the alloy selected, of four chemical equivalents of\r\ncopper to one of tin,[321] can scarcely be conceived. It is harder than\r\nsteel, yet brittle as glass, crumbling into fragments with the slightest\r\ninadvertence of handling or treatment;[322] and the precision of figure\r\nrequisite to secure good definition is almost beyond the power of\r\nlanguage to convey. The quantities involved are so small as not alone to\r\nelude sight, but to confound imagination. Sir John Herschel tells us\r\nthat \"the _total_ thickness to be abraded from the edge of a spherical\r\nspeculum 48 inches in diameter and 40 feet focus, to convert it into a\r\nparaboloid, is only 1/21333 of an inch;\"[323] yet upon this minute\r\ndifference of form depends the clearness of the image, and, as a\r\nconsequence, the entire efficiency of the instrument. \"Almost infinite,\"\r\nindeed (in the phrase of the late Dr. Robinson), must be the exactitude\r\nof the operation adapted to bring about so delicate a result.\r\n\r\nAt length, in 1839, two specula, each three feet in diameter, were\r\nturned out in such perfection as to prompt a still bolder experiment.\r\nThe various processes needed to insure success were now ascertained and\r\nunder control; all that was necessary was to repeat them on a larger\r\nscale. A gigantic mirror, six feet across and fifty-four in focal\r\nlength, was accordingly cast on the 13th of April, 1842; in two months\r\nit was ground down to figure by abrasion with emery and water, and\r\ndaintily polished with rouge; and by the month of February, 1845, the\r\n\"leviathan of Parsonstown\" was available for the examination of the\r\nheavens.\r\n\r\nThe suitable mounting of this vast machine was a problem scarcely less\r\ndifficult than its construction. The shape of a speculum needs to be\r\nmaintained with an elaborate care equal to that used in imparting it. In\r\nfact, one of the most formidable obstacles to increasing the size of\r\nsuch reflecting surfaces consists in their liability to bend under their\r\nown weight. That of the great Rosse speculum was no less than four tons.\r\nYet, although six inches in thickness, and composed of a material only a\r\ndegree inferior in rigidity to wrought iron, the strong pressure of a\r\nman's hand at its back produced sufficient flexure to distort\r\nperceptibly the image of a star reflected in it.[324] Thus the delicacy\r\nof its form was perishable equally by the stress of its own gravity, and\r\nby the slightest irregularity in the means taken to counteract that\r\nstress. The problem of affording a perfectly equable support in all\r\npossible positions was solved by resting the speculum upon twenty-seven\r\nplatforms of cast iron, felt-covered, and carefully fitted to the shape\r\nof the areas they were to carry, which platforms were themselves borne\r\nby a complex system of triangles and levers, ingeniously adapted to\r\ndistribute the weight with complete uniformity.[325]\r\n\r\nA tube which resembled, when erect, one of the ancient round towers of\r\nIreland,[326] served as the habitation of the great mirror. It was\r\nconstructed of deal staves bound together with iron hoops, was\r\nfifty-eight feet long (including the speculum-box), and seven in\r\ndiameter. A reasonably tall man may walk through it (as Dean Peacock\r\nonce did) with umbrella uplifted. Two piers of solid masonry, about\r\nfifty feet high, seventy long, and twenty-three apart, flanked the huge\r\nengine on either side. Its lower extremity rested on a universal joint\r\nof cast iron; above, it was slung in chains, and even in a gale of wind\r\nremained perfectly steady. The weight of the entire, although amounting\r\nto fifteen tons, was so skilfully counterpoised, that the tube could\r\nwith ease be raised or depressed by two men working a windlass. Its\r\nhorizontal range was limited by the lofty walls erected for its support\r\nto about ten degrees on each side of the meridian; but it moved\r\nvertically from near the horizon through the zenith as far as the pole.\r\nIts construction was of the Newtonian kind, the observer looking into\r\nthe side of the tube near its upper end, which a series of galleries and\r\nsliding stages enabled him to reach in any position. It has also, though\r\nrarely, been used without a second mirror, as a \"Herschelian\" reflector.\r\n\r\nThe splendour of the celestial objects as viewed with this vast\r\n\"light-grasper\" surpassed all expectation. \"Never in my life,\" exclaimed\r\nSir James South, \"did I see such glorious sidereal pictures.\"[327] The\r\norb of Jupiter produced an effect compared to that of the introduction\r\nof a coach-lamp into the telescope;[328] and certain star-clusters\r\nexhibited an appearance (we again quote Sir James South) \"such as man\r\nbefore had never seen, and which for its magnificence baffles all\r\ndescription.\" But it was in the examination of the nebulæ that the\r\nsuperiority of the new instrument was most strikingly displayed. A large\r\nnumber of these misty objects, which the utmost powers of Herschel's\r\nspecula had failed to resolve into stars, yielded at once to the\r\nParsonstown reflector; while many others showed under entirely changed\r\nforms through the disclosure of previously unseen details of structure.\r\n\r\nOne extremely curious result of the increase of light was the abolition\r\nof any sharp distinction between the two classes of \"annular\" and\r\n\"planetary\" nebulæ. Up to that time, only four ring-shaped systems--two\r\nin the northern and two in the southern hemisphere--were known to\r\nastronomers; they were now reinforced by five of the planetary kind, the\r\ndiscs of which were observed to be centrally perforated; while the\r\ndefinite margins visible in weaker instruments were replaced by ragged\r\nedges or filamentous fringes.\r\n\r\nStill more striking was the discovery of an entirely new and most\r\nremarkable species of nebulæ. These were termed \"spiral,\" from the more\r\nor less regular convolutions, resembling the whorls of a shell, in which\r\nthe matter composing them appeared to be distributed. The first and most\r\nconspicuous specimen of this class was met with in April, 1845; it is\r\nsituated in Canes Venatici, close to the tail of the Great Bear, and\r\nwore, in Sir J. Herschel's instruments, the aspect of a split ring\r\nencompassing a bright nucleus, thus presenting, as he supposed, a\r\ncomplete analogue to the system of the Milky Way. In the Rosse mirror it\r\nshone out as a vast whirlpool of light--a stupendous witness to the\r\npresence of cosmical activities on the grandest scale, yet regulated by\r\nlaws as to the nature of which we are profoundly ignorant. Professor\r\nStephen Alexander of New Jersey, however, concluded, from an\r\ninvestigation (necessarily founded on highly precarious data) of the\r\nmechanical condition of these extraordinary agglomerations, that we see\r\nin them \"the partially scattered fragments of enormous masses once\r\nrotating in a state of dynamical equilibrium.\" He further suggested\r\n\"that the separation of these fragments may still be in progress,\"[329]\r\nand traced back their origin to the disruption, through its own\r\ncontinually accelerated rotation, of a \"primitive spheroid\" of\r\ninconceivably vast dimensions. Such also, it was added (the curvilinear\r\nform of certain outliers of the Milky Way giving evidence of a spiral\r\nstructure), is probably the history of our own cluster; the stars\r\ncomposing which, no longer held together in a delicately adjusted system\r\nlike that of the sun and planets, are advancing through a period of\r\nseeming confusion towards an appointed goal of higher order and more\r\nperfect and harmonious adaptation.[330]\r\n\r\nThe class of spiral nebulæ included, in 1850, fourteen members, besides\r\nseveral in which the characteristic arrangement seemed partial or\r\ndubious.[331] A tendency in the exterior stars of other clusters to\r\ngather into curved branches (as in our Galaxy) was likewise noted; and\r\nthe existence of unsuspected analogies was proclaimed by the significant\r\ncombination in the \"Owl\" nebula (a large planetary in Ursa Major)[332]\r\nof the twisted forms of a spiral with the perforated effect distinctive\r\nof an annular nebula.\r\n\r\nOnce more, by the achievements of the Parsonstown reflector, the\r\nsupposition of a \"shining fluid\" filling vast regions of space was\r\nbrought into (as it has since proved) undeserved discredit. Although\r\nLord Rosse himself rejected the inference, that because many nebulæ had\r\nbeen resolved, all were resolvable, very few imitated his truly\r\nscientific caution; and the results of Bond's investigations[333] with\r\nthe Harvard College refractor quickened and strengthened the current of\r\nprevalent opinion. It is now certain that the evidence furnished on both\r\nsides of the Atlantic as to the stellar composition of some conspicuous\r\nobjects of this class (notably the Orion and \"Dumb-bell\" nebulæ) was\r\ndelusive; but the spectroscope alone was capable of meeting it with a\r\ncategorical denial. Meanwhile there seemed good ground for the\r\npersuasion, which now, for the last time, gained the upper hand, that\r\nnebulæ are, without exception, true \"island-universes,\" or assemblages\r\nof distant suns.\r\n\r\nLord Rosse's telescope possesses a nominal power of 6,000--that is, it\r\nshows the moon as if viewed with the naked eye at a distance of forty\r\nmiles. But this seeming advantage is neutralised by the weakening of the\r\navailable light through excessive diffusion, as well as by the troubles\r\nof the surging sea of air through which the observation must necessarily\r\nbe made. Professor Newcomb, in fact, doubts whether with _any_ telescope\r\nour satellite has ever been seen to such advantage as it would be if\r\nbrought within 500 miles of the unarmed eye.[334]\r\n\r\nThe French opticians' rule of doubling the number of millimetres\r\ncontained in the aperture of an instrument to find the highest\r\nmagnifying power usually applicable to it, would give 3,600 as the\r\nmaximum for the leviathan of Birr Castle; but in a climate like that of\r\nIreland the occasions must be rare when even that limit can be reached.\r\nIndeed, the experience acquired by its use plainly shows that\r\natmospheric rather than mechanical difficulties impede a still further\r\nincrease of telescopic power. Its construction may accordingly be said\r\nto mark the _ne plus ultra_ of effort in one direction, and the\r\nbeginning of its conversion towards another. It became thenceforward\r\nmore and more obvious that the conditions of observation must be\r\nameliorated before any added efficacy could be given to it. The full\r\neffect of an uncertain climate in nullifying optical improvements was\r\nrecognised, and the attention of astronomers began to be turned towards\r\nthe advantages offered by more tranquil and more translucent skies.\r\n\r\nScarcely less important for the practical uses of astronomy than the\r\noptical qualities of the telescope is the manner of its mounting. The\r\nmost admirable performance of the optician can render but unsatisfactory\r\nservice if its mechanical accessories are ill-arranged or inconvenient.\r\nThus the astronomer is ultimately dependent upon the mechanician; and so\r\nexcellently have his needs been served, that the history of the\r\ningenious contrivances by which discoveries have been prepared would\r\nsupply a subject (here barely glanced at) not far inferior in extent and\r\ninstruction to the history of those discoveries themselves.\r\n\r\nThere are two chief modes of using the telescope, to which all others\r\nmay be considered subordinate.[335] Either it may be invariably directed\r\ntowards the south, with no motion save in the plane of the meridian, so\r\nas to intercept the heavenly bodies at the moment of transit across that\r\nplain; or it may be arranged so as to follow the daily revolution of the\r\nsky, thus keeping the object viewed permanently in sight instead of\r\nsimply noting the instant of its flitting across the telescopic field.\r\nThe first plan is that of the \"transit instrument,\" the second that of\r\nthe \"equatoreal.\" Both were, by a remarkable coincidence, introduced\r\nabout 1690[336] by Olaus Römer, the brilliant Danish astronomer who\r\nfirst measured the velocity of light.\r\n\r\nThe uses of each are entirely different. With the transit, the really\r\nfundamental task of astronomy--the determination of the movements of the\r\nheavenly bodies--is mainly accomplished; while the investigation of\r\ntheir nature and peculiarities is best conducted with the equatoreal.\r\nOne is the instrument of mathematical, the other of descriptive\r\nastronomy. One furnishes the materials with which theories are\r\nconstructed and the tests by which they are corrected; the other\r\nregisters new facts, takes note of new appearances, sounds the depths\r\nand peers into every nook of the heavens.\r\n\r\nThe great improvement of giving to a telescope equatoreally mounted an\r\nautomatic movement by connecting it with clockwork, was proposed in 1674\r\nby Robert Hooke. Bradley in 1721 actually observed Mars with a telescope\r\n\"moved by a machine that made it keep pace with the stars;\"[337] and Von\r\nZach relates[338] that he had once followed Sirius for twelve hours with\r\na \"heliostat\" of Ramsden's construction. But these eighteenth-century\r\nattempts were of no practical effect. Movement by clockwork was\r\nvirtually a complete novelty when it was adopted by Fraunhofer in 1824\r\nto the Dorpat refractor. By simply giving to an axis unvaryingly\r\ndirected towards the celestial pole an equable rotation with a period of\r\ntwenty-four hours, a telescope attached to it, and pointed in _any_\r\ndirection, will trace out on the sky a parallel of declination, thus\r\nnecessarily accompanying the movement of any star upon which it may be\r\nfixed. It accordingly forms part of the large sum of Fraunhofer's merits\r\nto have secured this inestimable advantage to observers.\r\n\r\nSir John Herschel considered that Lassell's application of equatoreal\r\nmounting to a nine-inch Newtonian in 1840 made an epoch in the history\r\nof \"that eminently British instrument, the reflecting telescope.\"[339]\r\nNearly a century earlier,[340] it is true, Short had fitted one of his\r\nGregorians to a complicated system of circles in such a manner that, by\r\nmoving a handle, it could be made to follow the revolution of the sky;\r\nbut the arrangement did not obtain, nor did it deserve, general\r\nadoption. Lassell's plan was a totally different one; he employed the\r\ncrossed axes of the true equatoreal, and his success removed, to a great\r\nextent, the fatal objection of inconvenience in use, until then\r\nunanswerably urged against reflectors. The very largest of these can now\r\nbe mounted equatoreally; even the Rosse, within its limited range, has\r\nbeen for some years provided with a movement by clockwork along\r\ndeclination-parallels.\r\n\r\nThe art of accurately dividing circular arcs into the minute equal parts\r\nwhich serve as the units of astronomical measurement, remained, during\r\nthe whole of the eighteenth century, almost exclusively in English\r\nhands. It was brought to a high degree of perfection by Graham, Bird and\r\nRamsden, all of whom, however, gave the preference to the old-fashioned\r\nmural quadrant and zenith-sector over the entire circle, which Römer had\r\nalready found the advantage of employing. The five-foot vertical circle,\r\nwhich Piazzi with some difficulty induced Ramsden to complete for him in\r\n1789, was the first divided instrument constructed in what may be called\r\nthe modern style. It was provided with magnifiers for reading off the\r\ndivisions (one of the neglected improvements of Römer), and was set up\r\nabove a smaller horizontal circle, forming an \"altitude and azimuth\"\r\ncombination (again Römer's invention), by which both the elevation of a\r\ncelestial object above the horizon and its position as referred to the\r\nhorizon could be measured. In the same year, Borda invented the\r\n\"repeating circle\" (the principle of which had been suggested by Tobias\r\nMayer in 1756[341]), a device for exterminating, so far as possible,\r\nerrors of graduation by _repeating_ an observation with different parts\r\nof the limb. This was perhaps the earliest systematic effort to correct\r\nthe imperfections of instruments by the manner of their use.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of astronomical circles was brought to a very refined\r\nstate of excellence early in the nineteenth century by Reichenbach at\r\nMunich, and after 1818 by Repsold at Hamburg. Bessel states[342] that\r\nthe \"reading-off\" on an instrument of the kind by the latter artist was\r\naccurate to about 1/80th of a human hair. Meanwhile the traditional\r\nreputation of the English school was fully sustained; and Sir George\r\nAiry did not hesitate to express his opinion that the new method of\r\ngraduating circles, published by Troughton in 1809,[343] was the\r\n\"greatest improvement ever made in the art of instrument-making.\"[344]\r\nBut a more secure road to improvement than that of mere mechanical\r\nexactness was pointed out by Bessel. His introduction of a regular\r\ntheory of instrumental errors might almost be said to have created a new\r\nart of observation. Every instrument, he declared in memorable\r\nwords,[345] must be twice made--once by the artist, and again by the\r\nobserver. Knowledge is power. Defects that are ascertained and can be\r\nallowed for are as good as non-existent. Thus the truism that the best\r\ninstrument is worthless in the hands of a careless or clumsy observer,\r\nbecame supplemented by the converse maxim, that defective appliances\r\nmay, through skilful use, be made to yield valuable results. The\r\nKönigsberg observations--of which the first instalment was published in\r\n1815--set the example of regular \"reduction\" for instrumental errors.\r\nSince then, it has become an elementary part of an astronomer's duty to\r\nstudy the _idiosyncrasy_ of each one of the mechanical contrivances at\r\nhis disposal, in order that its inevitable, but now certified deviations\r\nfrom ideal accuracy may be included amongst the numerous corrections by\r\nwhich the pure essence of even approximate truth is distilled from the\r\nrude impressions of sense.\r\n\r\nNor is this enough; for the casual circumstances attending each\r\nobservation have to be taken into account with no less care than the\r\ninherent or _constitutional_ peculiarities of the instrument with which\r\nit is made. There is no \"once for all\" in astronomy. Vigilance can never\r\nsleep; patience can never tire. Variable as well as constant sources of\r\nerror must be anxiously heeded; one infinitesimal inaccuracy must be\r\nweighed against another; all the forces and vicissitudes of\r\nnature--frosts, dews, winds, the interchanges of heat, the disturbing\r\neffects of gravity, the shiverings of the air, the tremors of the earth,\r\nthe weight and vital warmth of the observer's own body, nay, the rate at\r\nwhich his brain receives and transmits its impressions, must all enter\r\ninto his calculations, and be sifted out from his results.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1823 that Bessel drew attention to discrepancies in the times\r\nof transits given by different astronomers.[346] The quantities involved\r\nwere far from insignificant. He was himself nearly a second in advance\r\nof all his contemporaries, Argelander lagging behind him as much as a\r\nsecond and a quarter. Each individual, in fact, was found to have a\r\ncertain definite _rate of perception_, which, under the name of\r\n\"personal equation,\" now forms so important an element in the correction\r\nof observations that a special instrument for accurately determining its\r\namount in each case is in actual use at Greenwich.\r\n\r\nSuch are the refinements upon which modern astronomy depends for its\r\nprogress. It is a science of hairbreadths and fractions of a second. It\r\nexists only by the rigid enforcement of arduous accuracy and unwearying\r\ndiligence. Whatever secrets the universe still has in store for man will\r\nonly be communicated on these terms. They are, it must be acknowledged,\r\ndifficult to comply with. They involve an unceasing struggle against the\r\ninfirmities of his nature and the instabilities of his position. But the\r\nend is not unworthy the sacrifices demanded. One additional ray of light\r\nthrown on the marvels of creation--a single, minutest encroachment upon\r\nthe strongholds of ignorance--is recompense enough for a lifetime of\r\ntoil. Or rather, the toil is its own reward, if pursued in the lofty\r\nspirit which alone becomes it. For it leads through the abysses of space\r\nand the unending vistas of time to the very threshold of that infinity\r\nand eternity of which the disclosure is reserved for a life to come.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 305: Grant, _Hist.

His choice of an object for his researches was\r\ninstigated by his friend Harding of Göttingen. It was a peculiarly happy\r\none. The changes visible in the solar surface were then generally\r\nregarded as no less capricious than the changes in the skies of our\r\ntemperate regions. Consequently, the reckoning and registering of\r\nsun-spots was a task hardly more inviting to an astronomer than the\r\nreckoning and registering of summer clouds. Cassini, Keill, Lemonnier,\r\nLalande, were unanimous in declaring that no trace of regularity could\r\nbe detected in their appearances or effacements.[348] Delambre\r\npronounced them \"more curious than really useful.\"[349] Even Herschel,\r\nprofoundly as he studied them, and intimately as he was convinced of\r\ntheir importance as symptoms of solar activity, saw no reason to suspect\r\nthat their abundance and scarcity were subject to orderly alternation.\r\nOne man alone in the eighteenth century, Christian Horrebow of\r\nCopenhagen, divined their periodical character, and foresaw the time\r\nwhen the effects of the sun's vicissitudes upon the globes revolving\r\nround him might be investigated with success; but this prophetic\r\nutterance was of the nature of a soliloquy rather than of a\r\ncommunication, and remained hidden away in an unpublished journal until\r\n1859, when it was brought to light in a general ransacking of\r\narchives.[350]\r\n\r\nIndeed, Schwabe himself was far from anticipating the discovery which\r\nfell to his share. He compared his fortune to that of Saul, who, seeking\r\nhis father's asses, found a kingdom.[351] For the hope which inspired\r\nhis early resolution lay in quite another direction. His patient ambush\r\nwas laid for a possible intramercurial planet, which, he thought, must\r\nsooner or later betray its existence in crossing the face of the sun. He\r\ntook, however, the most effectual measures to secure whatever new\r\nknowledge might be accessible. During forty-three years his\r\n\"imperturbable telescope\"[352] never failed, weather and health\r\npermitting, to bring in its daily report as to how many, or if any,\r\nspots were visible on the sun's disc, the information obtained being day\r\nby day recorded on a simple and unvarying system. In 1843 he made his\r\nfirst announcement of a probable decennial period,[353] but it met with\r\nno general attention; although Julius Schmidt of Bonn (afterwards\r\ndirector of the Athens Observatory) and Gautier of Geneva were impressed\r\nwith his figures, and Littrow had himself, in 1836,[354] hinted at the\r\nlikelihood of some kind of regular recurrence. Schwabe, however, worked\r\non, gathering each year fresh evidence of a law such as he had\r\nindicated; and when Humboldt published in 1851, in the third volume of\r\nhis _Kosmos_,[355] a table of the sun-spot statistics collected by him\r\nfrom 1826 downwards, the strength of his case was perceived with, so to\r\nspeak, a start of surprise; the reality and importance of the discovery\r\nwere simultaneously recognised, and the persevering Hofrath of Dessau\r\nfound himself famous among astronomers. His merit--recognised by the\r\nbestowal of the Astronomical Society's Gold Medal in 1857--consisted in\r\nhis choice of an original and appropriate line of work, and in the\r\nadmirable tenacity of purpose with which he pursued it. His resources\r\nand acquirements were those of an ordinary amateur; he was distinguished\r\nsolely by the unfortunately rare power of turning both to the best\r\naccount. He died where he was born and had lived, April 11, 1875, at the\r\nripe age of eighty-six.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile an investigation of a totally different character, and\r\nconducted by totally different means, had been prosecuted to a very\r\nsimilar conclusion. Two years after Schwabe began his solitary\r\nobservations, Humboldt gave the first impulse, at the Scientific\r\nCongress of Berlin in 1828, to a great international movement for\r\nattacking simultaneously, in various parts of the globe, the complex\r\nproblem of terrestrial magnetism. Through the genius and energy of\r\nGauss, Göttingen became its centre. Thence new apparatus, and a new\r\nsystem for its employment, issued; there, in 1833, the first regular\r\nmagnetic observatory was founded, whilst at Göttingen was fixed the\r\nuniversal time-standard for magnetic observations. A letter addressed by\r\nHumboldt in April, 1836, to the Duke of Sussex as President of the Royal\r\nSociety, enlisted the co-operation of England. A network of magnetic\r\nstations was spread all over the British dominions, from Canada to Van\r\nDiemen's Land; measures were concerted with foreign authorities, and an\r\nexpedition was fitted out, under the able command of Captain (afterwards\r\nSir James) Clark Ross, for the special purpose of bringing intelligence\r\non the subject from the dismal neighbourhood of the South Pole. In 1841,\r\nthe elaborate organisation created by the disinterested efforts of\r\nscientific \"agitators\" was complete; Gauss's \"magnetometers\" were\r\nvibrating under the view of attentive observers in five continents, and\r\nsimultaneous results began to be recorded.\r\n\r\nTen years later, in September, 1851, Dr. John Lamont, the Scotch\r\ndirector of the Munich Observatory, in reviewing the magnetic\r\nobservations made at Göttingen and Munich from 1835 to 1850, perceived\r\nwith some surprise that they gave unmistakable indications of a period\r\nwhich he estimated at 10-1/3 years.[356] The manner in which this\r\nperiodicity manifested itself requires a word of explanation. The\r\nobservations in question referred to what is called the \"declination\" of\r\nthe magnetic needle--that is, to the position assumed by it with\r\nreference to the points of the compass when moving freely in a\r\nhorizontal plane. Now this position--as was discovered by Graham in\r\n1722--is subject to a small daily fluctuation, attaining its maximum\r\ntowards the east about 8 A.M., and its maximum towards the west shortly\r\nbefore 2 P.M. In other words, the direction of the needle approaches (in\r\nthese countries at the present time) nearest to the true north some four\r\nhours before noon, and departs farthest from it between one and two\r\nhours after noon. It was the _range_ of this daily variation that Lamont\r\nfound to increase and diminish once in every 10-1/3 years.\r\n\r\nIn the following winter, Sir Edward Sabine, ignorant as yet of Lamont's\r\nconclusion, undertook to examine a totally different set of\r\nobservations. The materials in his hands had been collected at the\r\nBritish colonial stations of Toronto and Hobarton from 1843 to 1848, and\r\nhad reference, not to the regular diurnal swing of the needle, but to\r\nthose curious spasmodic vibrations, the inquiry into the laws of which\r\nwas the primary object of the vast organisation set on foot by Humboldt\r\nand Gauss. Yet the upshot was practically the same. Once in about ten\r\nyears, magnetic disturbances (termed by Humboldt \"storms\") were\r\nperceived to reach a maximum of violence and frequency. Sabine was the\r\nfirst to note the coincidence between this unlooked-for result and\r\nSchwabe's sun-spot period. He showed that, so far as observation had yet\r\ngone, the two cycles of change agreed perfectly both in duration and\r\nphase, maximum corresponding to maximum, minimum to minimum. What the\r\nnature of the connection could be that bound together by a common law\r\neffects so dissimilar as the rents in the luminous garment of the sun,\r\nand the swayings to and fro of the magnetic needle, was and still\r\nremains beyond the reach of well-founded theory; but the fact was from\r\nthe first undeniable.\r\n\r\nThe memoir containing this remarkable disclosure was presented to the\r\nRoyal Society, March 18, and read May 6, 1852.[357] On the 31st of July\r\nfollowing, Rudolf Wolf at Berne,[358] and on the 18th of August, Alfred\r\nGautier at Sion,[359] announced, separately and independently, perfectly\r\nsimilar conclusions. This triple event is perhaps the most striking\r\ninstance of the successful employment of the Baconian method of\r\nco-operation in discovery, by which \"particulars\" are amassed by one set\r\nof investigators--corresponding to the \"Depredators\" and \"Inoculators\"\r\nof Solomon's House--while inductions are drawn from them by another and\r\na higher class--the \"Interpreters of Nature.\" Yet even here the\r\nconvergence of two distinct lines of research was wholly fortuitous, and\r\nskilful combination owed the most brilliant part of its success to the\r\nunsought bounty of what we call Fortune.\r\n\r\nThe exactness of the coincidence thus brought to light was fully\r\nconfirmed by further inquiries. A diligent search through the scattered\r\nrecords of sun-spot observations, from the time of Galileo and Scheiner\r\nonwards, put Wolf[360] in possession of materials by which he was\r\nenabled to correct Schwabe's loosely-indicated decennial period to one\r\nof slightly over eleven (11.11) years; and he further showed that this\r\nfell in with the ebb and flow of magnetic change even better than\r\nLamont's 10-1/3 year cycle. The analogy was also pointed out between the\r\n\"light-curve,\" or zig-zagged line representing on paper the varying\r\nintensity in the lustre of certain stars, and the similar delineation of\r\nspot-frequency; the ascent from minimum to maximum being, in both cases,\r\nusually steeper than the descent from maximum to minimum; while an\r\nadditional point of resemblance was furnished by the irregularities in\r\nheight of the various maxima. In other words, both the number of spots\r\non the sun and the brightness of variable stars increase, as a rule,\r\nmore rapidly than they decrease; nor does the amount of that increase,\r\nin either instance, show any approach to uniformity.\r\n\r\nThe endeavour, suggested by the very nature of the phenomenon, to\r\nconnect sun-spots with weather was less successful. The first attempt of\r\nthe kind was made by Sir William Herschel in 1801, and a very notable\r\none it was. Meteorological statistics, save of the scantiest and most\r\ncasual kind, did not then exist; but the price of corn from year to year\r\nwas on record, and this, with full recognition of its inadequacy, he\r\nadopted as his criterion. Nor was he much better off for information\r\nrespecting the solar condition. What little he could obtain, however,\r\nserved, as he believed, to confirm his surmise that a copious emission\r\nof light and heat accompanies an abundant formation of \"openings\" in the\r\ndazzling substance whence our supply of those indispensable commodities\r\nis derived.[361] He gathered, in short, from his inquiries very much\r\nwhat he had expected to gather, namely, that the price of wheat was high\r\nwhen the sun showed an unsullied surface, and that food and spots became\r\nplentiful together.[362]\r\n\r\nYet this plausible inference was scarcely borne out by a more exact\r\ncollocation of facts. Schwabe failed to detect any reflection of the\r\nsun-spot period in his meteorological register. Gautier[363] reached a\r\nprovisional conclusion the reverse--though not markedly the reverse--of\r\nHerschel's. Wolf, in 1852, derived from an examination of Vogel's\r\ncollection of Zürich Chronicles (1000-1800 A.D.) evidence showing (as he\r\nthought) that minimum years were usually wet and stormy, maximum years\r\ndry and genial;[364] but a subsequent review of the subject in 1859\r\nconvinced him that no relation of any kind between the two kinds of\r\neffects was traceable.[365] With the singular affection of our\r\natmosphere known as the Aurora Borealis (more properly Aurora Polaris)\r\nthe case was different. Here the Zürich Chronicles set Wolf on the right\r\ntrack in leading him to associate such luminous manifestations with a\r\ndisturbed condition of the sun; since subsequent detailed observation\r\nhas exhibited the curve of auroral frequency as following with such\r\nfidelity the jagged lines figuring to the eye the fluctuations of solar\r\nand magnetic activity, as to leave no reasonable doubt that all three\r\nrise and sink together under the influence of a common cause. As long\r\nago as 1716,[366] Halley had conjectured that the Northern Lights were\r\ndue to magnetic \"effluvia,\" but there was no evidence on the subject\r\nforthcoming until Hiorter observed at Upsala in 1741 their agitating\r\ninfluence upon the magnetic needle. That the effect was no casual one\r\nwas made superabundantly clear by Arago's researches in 1819 and\r\nsubsequent years. Now both were perceived to be swayed by the same\r\nobscure power of cosmical disturbance.\r\n\r\nThe sun is not the only one of the heavenly bodies by which the\r\nmagnetism of the earth is affected. Proofs of a similar kind of lunar\r\naction were laid by Kreil in 1841 before the Bohemian Society of\r\nSciences, and with minor corrections were fully substantiated by\r\nSabine's more extended researches. It was thus ascertained that each\r\nlunar day, or the interval of twenty-four hours and about fifty-four\r\nminutes between two successive meridian passages of our satellite, is\r\nmarked by a perceptible, though very small, double oscillation of the\r\nneedle--two progressive movements from east to west, and two returns\r\nfrom west to east.[367] Moreover, the lunar, like the solar influence\r\n(as was proved in each case by Sabine's analysis of the Hobarton and\r\nToronto observations), extends to all three \"magnetic elements,\"\r\naffecting not only the position of the horizontal or _declination_\r\nneedle, but also the dip and intensity. It seems not unreasonable to\r\nattribute some portion of the same subtle power to the planets and even\r\nto the stars, though with effects rendered imperceptible by distance.\r\n\r\nWe have now to speak of the discovery and application to the heavenly\r\nbodies of a totally new method of investigation. Spectrum analysis may\r\nbe shortly described as a mode of distinguishing the various species of\r\nmatter by the kind of light proceeding from each. This definition at\r\nonce explains how it is that, unlike every other system of chemical\r\nanalysis, it has proved available in astronomy. Light, so far as\r\n_quality_ is concerned, ignores distance. No intrinsic change, that we\r\nyet know of, is produced in it by a journey from the farthest bounds of\r\nthe visible universe; so that, provided only that in _quantity_ it\r\nremain sufficient for the purpose, its peculiarities can be equally well\r\nstudied whether the source of its vibrations be one foot or a hundred\r\nbillion miles distant. Now the most obvious distinction between one kind\r\nof light and another resides in colour. But of this distinction the eye\r\ntakes cognisance in an æsthetic, not in a scientific sense. It finds\r\ngladness in the \"thousand tints\" of nature, but can neither analyse nor\r\ndefine them. Here the refracting prism--or the combination of prisms\r\nknown as the \"spectroscope\"--comes to its aid, teaching it to measure as\r\nwell as to perceive. It furnishes, in a word, an accurate scale of\r\ncolour. The various rays which, entering the eye together in a confused\r\ncrowd, produce a compound impression made up of undistinguishable\r\nelements, are, by the mere passage through a triangular piece of glass,\r\nseparated one from the other, and ranged side by side in orderly\r\nsuccession, so that it becomes possible to tell at a glance what kinds\r\nof light are present, and what absent. Thus, if we could only be assured\r\nthat the various chemical substances when made to glow by heat, emit\r\ncharacteristic rays--rays, that is, occupying a place in the spectrum\r\nreserved for them, and for them _only_--we should at once be in\r\npossession of a mode of identifying such substances with the utmost\r\nreadiness and certainty. This assurance, which forms the solid basis of\r\nspectrum analysis, was obtained slowly and with difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe first to employ the prism in the examination of various flames (for\r\nit is only in a state of vapour that matter emits distinctive light) was\r\na young Scotchman named Thomas Melvill, who died in 1753, at the age of\r\ntwenty-seven. He studied the spectrum of burning spirits, into which\r\nwere successively introduced sal ammoniac, potash, alum, nitre, and\r\nsea-salt, and observed the singular predominance, under almost all\r\ncircumstances, of a particular shade of yellow light, perfectly definite\r\nin its degree of refrangibility[368]--in other words, taking up a\r\nperfectly definite position in the spectrum. His experiments were\r\nrepeated by Morgan,[369] Wollaston, and--with far superior precision and\r\ndiligence--by Fraunhofer.[370] The great Munich optician, whose work was\r\ncompletely original, rediscovered Melvill's deep yellow ray and measured\r\nits place in the colour-scale. It has since become well known as the\r\n\"sodium line,\" and has played a very important part in the history of\r\nspectrum analysis. Nevertheless, its ubiquity and conspicuousness long\r\nimpeded progress. It was elicited by the combustion of a surprising\r\nvariety of substances--sulphur, alcohol, ivory, wood, paper; its\r\npersistent visibility suggesting the accomplishment of some universal\r\nprocess of nature rather than the presence of one individual kind of\r\nmatter. But if spectrum analysis were to exist as a science at all, it\r\ncould only be by attaining certainty as to the unvarying association of\r\none special substance with each special quality of light.\r\n\r\nThus perplexed, Fox Talbot[371] hesitated in 1826 to enounce this\r\nfundamental principle. He was inclined to believe that the presence in\r\nthe spectrum of any individual ray told unerringly of the volatilisation\r\nin the flame under scrutiny of some body as whose badge or distinctive\r\nsymbol that ray might be regarded; but the continual prominence of the\r\nyellow beam staggered him. It appeared, indeed, without fail where\r\nsodium _was_; but it also appeared where it might be thought only\r\nreasonable to conclude that sodium _was not_. Nor was it until thirty\r\nyears later that William Swan,[372] by pointing out the extreme delicacy\r\nof the spectral test, and the singularly wide dispersion of sodium, made\r\nit appear probable (but even then only probable) that the questionable\r\nyellow line was really due invariably to that substance. Common salt\r\n(chloride of sodium) is, in fact, the most diffusive of solids. It\r\nfloats in the air; it flows with water; every grain of dust has its\r\nattendant particle; its absolute exclusion approaches the impossible.\r\nAnd withal, the light that it gives in burning is so intense and\r\nconcentrated, that if a single grain be divided into 180 million parts,\r\nand one alone of such inconceivably minute fragments be present in a\r\nsource of light, the spectroscope will show unmistakably its\r\ncharacteristic beam.\r\n\r\nAmongst the pioneers of knowledge in this direction were Sir John\r\nHerschel[373]--who, however, applied himself to the subject in the\r\ninterests of optics, not of chemistry--W. A. Miller,[374] and\r\nWheatstone. The last especially made a notable advance when, in the\r\ncourse of his studies on the \"prismatic decomposition\" of the electric\r\nlight, he reached the significant conclusion that the rays visible in\r\nits spectrum were different for each kind of metal employed as\r\n\"electrodes.\"[375] Thus indications of a wider principle were to be\r\nfound in several quarters, but no positive certainty on any single point\r\nwas obtained, until, in 1859, Gustav Kirchhoff, professor of physics in\r\nthe University of Heidelberg, and his colleague, the eminent chemist\r\nRobert Bunsen, took the matter in hand. By them the general question as\r\nto the necessary and invariable connection of certain rays in the\r\nspectrum with certain kinds of matter, was first resolutely confronted,\r\nand first definitely answered. It was answered affirmatively--else there\r\ncould have been no science of spectrum analysis--as the result of\r\nexperiments more numerous, more stringent, and more precise than had\r\npreviously been undertaken.[376] And the assurance of their conclusion\r\nwas rendered doubly sure by the discovery, through the peculiarities of\r\ntheir light alone, of two new metals, named from the blue and red rays\r\nby which they were respectively distinguished, \"cæsium,\" and\r\n\"rubidium.\"[377] Both were immediately afterwards actually obtained in\r\nsmall quantities by evaporation of the Durckheim mineral waters.\r\n\r\nThe link connecting this important result with astronomy may now be\r\nindicated. In the year 1802 it occurred to William Hyde Wollaston to\r\nsubstitute for the round hole used by Newton and his successors for the\r\nadmittance of light to be examined with the prism, an elongated\r\n\"crevice\" 1/20th of an inch in width. He thereupon perceived that the\r\nspectrum, thus formed of light, as it were, _purified_ by the abolition\r\nof overlapping images, was traversed by seven dark lines. These he took\r\nto be natural boundaries of the various colours,[378] and satisfied with\r\nthis quasi-explanation, allowed the subject to drop. It was\r\nindependently taken up after twelve years by a man of higher genius. In\r\nthe course of experiments on light, directed towards the perfecting of\r\nhis achromatic lenses, Fraunhofer, by means of a slit and a telescope,\r\nmade the surprising discovery that the solar spectrum is crossed, not by\r\nseven, but by thousands of obscure transverse streaks.[379] Of these he\r\ncounted some 600, and carefully mapped 324, while a few of the most\r\nconspicuous he set up (if we may be permitted the expression) as\r\nlandmarks, measuring their distances apart with a theodolite, and\r\naffixing to them the letters of the alphabet, by which they are still\r\nuniversally known. Nor did he stop here. The same system of examination\r\napplied to the rest of the heavenly bodies showed the mild effulgence of\r\nthe moon and planets to be deficient in precisely the same rays as\r\nsunlight; while in the stars it disclosed the differences in likeness\r\nwhich are always an earnest of increased knowledge. The spectra of\r\nSirius and Castor, instead of being delicately ruled crosswise\r\nthroughout, like that of the sun, were seen to be interrupted by three\r\nmassive bars of darkness--two in the blue and one in the green;[380] the\r\nlight of Pollux, on the other hand, seemed precisely similar to sunlight\r\nattenuated by distance or reflection, and that of Capella, Betelgeux,\r\nand Procyon to share some of its peculiarities. One solar line\r\nespecially--that marked in his map with the letter D--proved common to\r\nall the four last-mentioned stars; and it was remarkable that it exactly\r\ncoincided in position with the conspicuous yellow beam (afterwards, as\r\nwe have said, identified with the light of glowing sodium) which he had\r\nalready found to accompany most kinds of combustion. Moreover, both the\r\n_dark_ solar and the _bright_ terrestrial \"D lines\" were displayed by\r\nthe refined Munich appliances as double.\r\n\r\nIn this striking correspondence, discovered by Fraunhofer in 1815, was\r\ncontained the very essence of solar chemistry; but its true significance\r\ndid not become apparent until long afterwards. Fraunhofer was by\r\nprofession, not a physicist, but a practical optician. Time pressed; he\r\ncould not and would not deviate from his appointed track; all that was\r\npossible to him was to indicate the road to discovery, and exhort others\r\nto follow it.[381]\r\n\r\nPartially and inconclusively at first this was done. The \"fixed lines\"\r\n(as they were called) of the solar spectrum took up the position of a\r\nstanding problem, to the solution of which no approach seemed possible.\r\nConjectures as to their origin were indeed rife. An explanation put\r\nforward by Zantedeschi[382] and others, and dubiously favoured by Sir\r\nDavid Brewster and Dr. J. H. Gladstone,[383] was that they resulted from\r\n\"interference\"--that is, a destruction of the motion producing in our\r\neyes the sensation of light, by the superposition of two light-waves in\r\nsuch a manner that the crests of one exactly fill up the hollows of the\r\nother. This effect was supposed to be brought about by imperfections in\r\nthe optical apparatus employed.\r\n\r\nA more plausible view was that the atmosphere of the earth was the agent\r\nby which sunlight was deprived of its missing beams. For a few of them\r\nthis is actually the case. Brewster found in 1832 that certain dark\r\nlines, which were invisible when the sun stood high in the heavens,\r\nbecame increasingly conspicuous as he approached the horizon.[384] These\r\nare the well-known \"atmospheric lines;\" but the immense majority of\r\ntheir companions in the spectrum remain quite unaffected by the\r\nthickness of the stratum of air traversed by the sunlight containing\r\nthem. They are then obviously due to another cause.\r\n\r\nThere remained the true interpretation--absorption in the _sun's_\r\natmosphere; and this, too, was extensively canvassed. But a remarkable\r\nobservation made by Professor Forbes of Edinburgh[385] on the occasion\r\nof the annular eclipse of May 15, 1836, appeared to throw discredit upon\r\nit. If the problematical dark lines were really occasioned by the\r\nstoppage of certain rays through the action of a vaporous envelope\r\nsurrounding the sun, they ought, it seemed, to be strongest in light\r\nproceeding from his edges, which, cutting that envelope obliquely,\r\npassed through a much greater depth of it. But the circle of light left\r\nby the interposing moon, and of course derived entirely from the rim of\r\nthe solar disc, yielded to Forbes's examination precisely the same\r\nspectrum as light coming from its central parts. This circumstance\r\nhelped to baffle inquirers, already sufficiently perplexed. It still\r\nremains an anomaly, of which no satisfactory explanation has been\r\noffered.\r\n\r\nConvincing evidence as to the true nature of the solar lines was however\r\nat length, in the autumn of 1859, brought forward at Heidelburg.\r\nKirchhoff's _experimentum crucis_ in the matter was a very simple one.\r\nHe threw bright sunshine across a space occupied by vapour of sodium,\r\nand perceived with astonishment that the dark Fraunhofer line D, instead\r\nof being effaced by flame giving a luminous ray of the same\r\nrefrangibility, was deepened and thickened by the superposition.\r\n\r\nHe tried the same experiment, substituting for sunbeams light from a\r\nDrummond lamp, and with similar result. A dark furrow, corresponding in\r\nevery respect to the solar D-line, was instantly seen to interrupt the\r\notherwise unbroken radiance of its spectrum. The inference was\r\nirresistible, that the effect thus produced artificially was brought\r\nabout naturally in the same way, and that sodium formed an ingredient in\r\nthe glowing atmosphere of the sun.[386] This first discovery was quickly\r\nfollowed up by the identification of numerous bright rays in the spectra\r\nof other metallic bodies with others of the hitherto mysterious\r\nFraunhofer lines. Kirchhoff was thus led to the conclusion that (besides\r\nsodium) iron, magnesium, calcium, and chromium, are certainly solar\r\nconstituents, and that copper, zinc, barium, and nickel are also\r\npresent, though in smaller quantities.[387] As to cobalt, he hesitated\r\nto pronounce, but its existence in the sun has since been established.\r\n\r\nThese memorable results were founded upon a general principle first\r\nenunciated by Kirchhoff in a communication to the Berlin Academy,\r\nDecember 15, 1859, and afterwards more fully developed by him.[388] It\r\nmay be expressed as follows: Substances of every kind are opaque to the\r\nprecise rays which they emit at the same temperature; that is to say,\r\nthey stop the kinds of light or heat which they are then actually in a\r\ncondition to radiate. But it does not follow that _cool_ bodies absorb\r\nthe rays which they would give out if sufficiently heated. Hydrogen at\r\nordinary temperatures, for instance, is almost perfectly transparent,\r\nbut if raised to the glowing point--as by the passage of electricity--it\r\n_then_ becomes capable of arresting, and at the same time of displaying\r\nin its own spectrum light of four distinct colours.\r\n\r\nThis principle is fundamental to solar chemistry. It gives the key to\r\nthe hieroglyphics of the Fraunhofer lines. The identical characters\r\nwhich are written _bright_ in terrestrial spectra are written _dark_ in\r\nthe unrolled sheaf of sun-rays; the meaning remains unchanged. It must,\r\nhowever, be remembered that they are only _relatively_ dark. The\r\nsubstances stopping those particular tints in the neighbourhood of the\r\nsun are at the same time vividly glowing with the very same. Remove the\r\ndazzling solar background, by contrast with which they show as obscure,\r\nand they will be seen, and, at critical moments, actually have been\r\nseen, in all their native splendour. It is because the atmosphere of the\r\nsun is cooler than the globe it envelops that the different kinds of\r\nvapour constituting that atmosphere take more than they give, absorb\r\nmore light than they are capable of emitting; raise them to the same\r\ntemperature as the sun itself, and their powers of emission and\r\nabsorption being brought exactly to the same level, the thousands of\r\ndusky rays in the solar spectrum will be at once obliterated.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of the terrestrial science of spectrum analysis was\r\ndue, as we have seen, equally to Kirchhoff and Bunsen, but its celestial\r\napplication to Kirchhoff alone. He effected this object of the\r\naspirations, more or less dim, of many other thinkers and workers, by\r\nthe union of two separate, though closely related lines of research--the\r\nstudy of the different kinds of light _emitted_ by various bodies, and\r\nthe study of the different kinds of light _absorbed_ by them. The latter\r\nbranch appears to have been first entered upon by Dr. Thomas Young in\r\n1803;[389] it was pursued by the younger Herschel,[390] by William Allen\r\nMiller, Brewster, and Gladstone. Brewster indeed made, in 1833,[391] a\r\nformal attempt to found what might be called an inverse system of\r\nanalysis with the prism based upon absorption; and his efforts were\r\nrepeated, just a quarter of a century later, by Gladstone.[392] But no\r\ngeneral point of view was attained; nor, it may be added, was it by this\r\npath attainable.\r\n\r\nKirchhoff's map of the solar spectrum, drawn to scale with exquisite\r\naccuracy, and printed in three shades of ink to convey the graduated\r\nobscurity of the lines, was published in the Transactions of the Berlin\r\nAcademy for 1861 and 1862.[393] Representations of the principal lines\r\nbelonging to various elementary bodies formed, as it were, a series of\r\nmarginal notes accompanying the great solar scroll, enabling the veriest\r\ntiro in the new science to decipher its meaning at a glance. Where the\r\ndark solar and bright metallic rays agreed in position, it might safely\r\nbe inferred that the metal emitting them was a solar constituent; and\r\nsuch coincidences were numerous. In the case of iron alone, no less than\r\nsixty occurred in one-half of the spectral area, rendering the\r\nchances[394] absolutely overwhelming against mere casual conjunction.\r\nThe preparation of this elaborate picture proved so trying to the eyes\r\nthat Kirchhoff was compelled by failing vision to resign the latter half\r\nof the task to his pupil Hofmann. The complete map measured nearly eight\r\nfeet in length.\r\n\r\nThe conclusions reached by Kirchhoff were no sooner announced than they\r\ntook their place, with scarcely a dissenting voice, among the\r\nestablished truths of science. The broad result, that the dark lines in\r\nthe spectrum of the sun afford an index to its chemical composition no\r\nless reliable than any of the tests used in the laboratory, was equally\r\ncaptivating to the imagination of the vulgar, and authentic in the\r\njudgment of the learned; and, like all genuine advances in the knowledge\r\nof Nature, it stimulated curiosity far more than it gratified it. Now\r\nthe history of how discoveries were missed is often quite as instructive\r\nas the history of how they were made; it may then be worth while to\r\nexpend a few words on the thoughts and trials by which, in the present\r\ncase, the actual event was heralded.\r\n\r\nThree times it seemed on the verge of being anticipated. The experiment,\r\nwhich in Kirchhoff's hands proved decisive, of passing sunlight through\r\nglowing vapours and examining the superposed spectra, was performed by\r\nProfessor W. A. Miller of King's College in 1845.[395] Nay, more, it was\r\nperformed with express reference to the question, then already (as has\r\nbeen noted) in debate, of the possible production of Fraunhofer's lines\r\nby absorption in a solar atmosphere. Yet it led to nothing.\r\n\r\nAgain, at Paris in 1849, with a view to testing the asserted coincidence\r\nbetween the solar D-line and the bright yellow beam in the spectrum of\r\nthe electric arc (really due to the unsuspected presence of sodium),\r\nLéon Foucault threw a ray of sunshine across the arc and observed its\r\nspectrum.[396] He was surprised to see that the D-line was rendered more\r\nintensely dark by the combination of lights. To assure himself still\r\nfurther, he substituted a reflected image of one of the white-hot\r\ncarbon-points for the sunbeam, with an identical result. _The same ray\r\nwas missing._ It needed but another step to have generalised this\r\nresult, and thus laid hold of a natural truth of the highest importance;\r\nbut that step was not taken. Foucault, keen and brilliant though he was,\r\nrested satisfied with the information that the _voltaic arc_ had the\r\npower of stopping the kind of light emitted by it; he asked no further\r\nquestion, and was consequently the bearer of no further intelligence on\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nThe truth conveyed by this remarkable experiment was, however, divined\r\nby one eminent man. Professor Stokes of Cambridge stated to Sir William\r\nThomson (now Lord Kelvin), shortly after it had been made, his\r\nconviction that an absorbing atmosphere of sodium surrounded the sun.\r\nAnd so forcibly was his hearer impressed with the weight of the argument\r\nbased upon the absolute agreement of the D-line in the solar spectrum\r\nwith the yellow ray of burning sodium (then freshly certified by W. H.\r\nMiller), combined with Foucault's \"reversal\" of that ray, that he\r\nregularly inculcated, in his public lectures on natural philosophy at\r\nGlasgow, five or six years before Kirchhoff's discovery, not only the\r\n_fact_ of the presence of sodium in the solar neighbourhood, but also\r\nthe _principle_ of the study of solar and stellar chemistry in the\r\nspectra of flames.[397] Yet it does not appear to have occurred to\r\neither of these two distinguished professors--themselves among the\r\nforemost of their time in the successful search for new truths--to\r\nverify practically a sagacious conjecture in which was contained the\r\npossibility of a scientific revolution. It is just to add, that\r\nKirchhoff was unacquainted, when he undertook his investigation, either\r\nwith the experiment of Foucault or the speculation of Stokes.\r\n\r\nFor C. J. Ångström, on the other hand, perhaps somewhat too much has\r\nbeen claimed in the way of anticipation. His _Optical Researches_\r\nappeared at Upsala in 1853, and in their English garb two years\r\nlater.[398] They were undoubtedly pregnant with suggestion, yet made no\r\nepoch in discovery. The old perplexities continued to prevail after, as\r\nbefore their publication. To Ångström, indeed, belongs the great merit\r\nof having revived Euler's principle of the equivalence of emission and\r\nabsorption; but he revived it in its original crude form, and without\r\nthe qualifying proviso which alone gave it value as a clue to new\r\ntruths. According to his statement, a body absorbs all the series of\r\nvibrations it is, under any circumstances, capable of emitting, as well\r\nas those connected with them by simple harmonic relations. This is far\r\ntoo wide. To render it either true or useful, it had to be reduced to\r\nthe cautious terms employed by Kirchhoff. Radiation strictly and\r\nnecessarily corresponds with absorption only _when the temperature is\r\nthe same_. In point of fact, Ångström was still, in 1853, divided\r\nbetween adsorption and interference as the mode of origin of the\r\nFraunhofer dark rays. Very important, however, was his demonstration of\r\nthe compound nature of the spark-spectrum, which he showed to be made up\r\nof the spectrum of the metallic electrodes superposed upon that of the\r\ngas or gases across which the discharge passed.\r\n\r\nIt may here be useful--since without some clear ideas on the subject no\r\nproper understanding of recent astronomical progress is possible--to\r\ntake a cursory view of the elementary principles of spectrum analysis.\r\nTo many of our readers they are doubtless already familiar; but it is\r\nbetter to appear trite to some than obscure even to a few.\r\n\r\nThe spectrum, then, of a body is simply the light proceeding from it\r\n_spread out_ by refraction[399] into a brilliant variegated band,\r\npassing from brownish-red through crimson, orange, yellow, green, and\r\nazure into dusky violet. The reason of this spreading-out or\r\n\"dispersion\" is that the various colours have different wave-lengths,\r\nand consequently meet with different degrees of retardation in\r\ntraversing the denser medium of the prism. The shortest and quickest\r\nvibrations (producing the sensation we call \"violet\") are thrown\r\nfarthest away from their original path--in other words, suffer the\r\nwidest \"deviation;\" the longest and slowest (the red) travel much nearer\r\nto it. Thus the sheaf of rays which would otherwise combine into a patch\r\nof white light are separated through the divergence of their tracks\r\nafter refraction by a prism, so as to form a tinted riband. This\r\n_visible_ spectrum is prolonged _invisibly_ at both ends by a long range\r\nof vibrations, either too rapid or too sluggish to affect the eye as\r\nlight, but recognisable through their chemical and heating effects.\r\n\r\nNow all incandescent solid or liquid substances, and even gases ignited\r\nunder great pressure, give what is called a \"continuous spectrum;\" that\r\nis to say, the light derived from them is of every conceivable hue.\r\nSorted out with the prism, its tints merge imperceptibly one into the\r\nother, uninterrupted by any dark spaces. No colours, in short, are\r\nmissing. But gases and vapours rendered luminous by heat emit rays of\r\nonly a few tints, which accordingly form an interrupted spectrum,\r\nusually designated as one of lines or bands. And since these rays are\r\nperfectly definite and characteristic--not being the same for any two\r\nsubstances--it is easy to tell what kind of matter is concerned in\r\nproducing them. We may suppose that the inconceivably minute particles\r\nwhich by their rapid thrilling agitate the ethereal medium so as to\r\nproduce light, are free to give out their peculiar tone of vibration\r\nonly when floating apart from each other in gaseous form; but when\r\ncrowded together into a condensed mass, the clear ring of the\r\ndistinctive note is drowned, so to speak, in a universal molecular\r\nclang. Thus prismatic analysis has no power to identify individual kinds\r\nof matter, except when they present themselves as glowing vapours.\r\n\r\nA spectrum is said to be \"reversed\" when lines previously seen bright on\r\na dark background appear dark on a bright background. In this form it is\r\nequally characteristic of chemical composition with the \"direct\"\r\nspectrum, being due to _absorption_, as the latter is to _emission_. And\r\nabsorption and emission are, by Kirchhoff's law, strictly correlative.\r\nThis is easily understood by the analogy of sound. For just as a\r\ntuning-fork responds to sound-waves of its own pitch, but remains\r\nindifferent to those of any other, so those particles of matter whose\r\nnature it is, when set swinging by heat, to vibrate a certain number of\r\ntimes in a second, thus giving rise to light of a particular shade of\r\ncolour, appropriate those same vibrations, and those only, when\r\ntransmitted past them,--or, phrasing it otherwise, are opaque to them,\r\nand transparent to all others.\r\n\r\nIt should further be explained that the _shape_ of the bright or dark\r\nspaces in the spectrum has nothing whatever to do with the nature of the\r\nphenomena. The \"lines\" and \"bands\" so frequently spoken of are seen as\r\nsuch for no other reason than because the light forming them is admitted\r\nthrough a narrow, straight opening. Change that opening into a fine\r\ncrescent or a sinuous curve, and the \"lines\" will at once appear as\r\ncrescents or curves.\r\n\r\nResuming in a sentence what has been already explained, we find that the\r\nprismatic analysis of the heavenly bodies was founded upon three classes\r\nof facts: First, the unmistakable character of the light given by each\r\ndifferent kind of glowing vapour; secondly, the identity of the light\r\nabsorbed with the light emitted by each; thirdly, the coincidence\r\nobserved between rays missing from the solar spectrum and rays absorbed\r\nby various terrestrial substances. Thus, a realm of knowledge,\r\npronounced by Morinus[400] in the seventeenth century, and no less\r\ndogmatically by Auguste Comte[401] in the nineteenth, hopelessly out of\r\nreach of the human intellect, was thrown freely open, and the chemistry\r\nof the sun and stars took at once a leading place among the experimental\r\nsciences.\r\n\r\nThe immediate increase of knowledge was not the chief result of\r\nKirchhoff's labours; still more important was the change in the scope\r\nand methods of astronomy, which, set on foot in 1852 by the detection of\r\na common period affecting at once the spots on the sun and the magnetism\r\nof the earth, was extended and accelerated by the discovery of spectrum\r\nanalysis. The nature of that change is concisely indicated by the\r\nheading of the present chapter; we would now ask our readers to\r\nendeavour to realise somewhat distinctly what is implied by the\r\n\"foundation of astronomical physics.\"\r\n\r\nJust three centuries ago, Kepler drew a forecast of what he called a\r\n\"physical astronomy\"--a science treating of the efficient causes of\r\nplanetary motion, and holding the \"key to the inner astronomy.\"[402]\r\nWhat Kepler dreamed of and groped after, Newton realized. He showed the\r\nbeautiful and symmetrical revolutions of the solar system to be governed\r\nby a uniformly acting cause, and that cause no other than the familiar\r\nforce of gravity, which gives stability to all our terrestrial\r\nsurroundings. The world under our feet was thus for the first time\r\nbrought into physical connection with the worlds peopling space, and a\r\nvery tangible relationship was demonstrated as existing between what\r\nused to be called the \"corruptible\" matter of the earth and the\r\n\"incorruptible\" matter of the heavens.\r\n\r\nThis process of unification of the cosmos--this levelling of the\r\ncelestial with the sublunary--was carried no farther until the fact\r\nunexpectedly emerged from a vast and complicated mass of observations,\r\nthat the magnetism of the earth is subject to subtle influences,\r\nemanating, certainly from some, and presumably from all of the heavenly\r\nbodies; the inference being thus rendered at least plausible, that a\r\nforce not less universal than gravity itself, but with whose modes of\r\naction we are as yet unacquainted, pervades the universe, and forms, it\r\nmight be said, an intangible bond of sympathy between its parts. Now for\r\nthe investigation of this influence two roads are open. It may be\r\npursued by observation either of the bodies from which it proceeds, or\r\nof the effects which it produces--that is to say, either by the\r\nastronomer or by the physicist, or, better still, by both concurrently.\r\nTheir acquisitions are mutually profitable; nor can either be considered\r\nas independent of the other. Any important accession to knowledge\r\nrespecting the sun, for example, may be expected to cast a reflected\r\nlight on the still obscure subject of terrestrial magnetism; while\r\ndiscoveries in magnetism or its _alter ego_ electricity must profoundly\r\naffect solar inquiries.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of the new method of spectrum analysis drew far closer\r\nthis alliance between celestial and terrestrial science. Indeed, they\r\nhave come to merge so intimately one into the other, that it is no\r\neasier to trace their respective boundaries than it is to draw a clear\r\ndividing-line between the animal and vegetable kingdoms. Yet up to the\r\nmiddle of the last century, astronomy, while maintaining her strict\r\nunion with mathematics, looked with indifference on the rest of the\r\nsciences; it was enough that she possessed the telescope and the\r\ncalculus. Now the materials for her inductions are supplied by the\r\nchemist, the electrician, the inquirer into the most recondite mysteries\r\nof light and the molecular constitution of matter. She is concerned with\r\nwhat the geologist, the meteorologist, even the biologist, has to say;\r\nshe can afford to close her ears to no new truth of the physical order.\r\nHer position of lofty isolation has been exchanged for one of community\r\nand mutual aid. The astronomer has become, in the highest sense of the\r\nterm, a physicist; while the physicist is bound to be something of an\r\nastronomer.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is what is designed to be conveyed by the \"foundation of\r\nastronomical or cosmical physics.\" It means the establishment of a\r\nscience of Nature whose conclusions are not only presumed by analogy,\r\nbut are ascertained by observation, to be valid wherever light can\r\ntravel and gravity is obeyed--a science by which the nature of the stars\r\ncan be studied upon the earth, and the nature of the earth can be made\r\nbetter known by study of the stars--a science, in a word, which is, or\r\naims at being, one and universal, even as Nature--the visible reflection\r\nof the invisible highest Unity--is one and universal.\r\n\r\nIt is not too much to say that a new birth of knowledge has ensued. The\r\nastronomy so signally promoted by Bessel[403]--the astronomy placed by\r\nComte[404] at the head of the hierarchy of the physical sciences--was\r\nthe science of the _movements_ of the heavenly bodies. And there were\r\nthose who began to regard it as a science which, from its very\r\nperfection, had ceased to be interesting--whose tale of discoveries was\r\ntold, and whose farther advance must be in the line of minute technical\r\nimprovements, not of novel and stirring disclosures. But the science of\r\nthe _nature_ of the heavenly bodies is one only in the beginning of its\r\ncareer. It is full of the audacities, the inconsistencies, the\r\nimperfections, the possibilities of youth. It promises everything; it\r\nhas already performed much; it will doubtless perform much more. The\r\nmeans at its disposal are vast and are being daily augmented. What has\r\nso far been secured by them it must now be our task to extricate from\r\nmore doubtful surroundings and place in due order before our readers.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 347: Wolf, _Gesch. der Astr._, p. 655.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 348: Manuel Johnson, _Mem.

Since Schwabe's discovery was published in 1851, observers have\r\nmultiplied, new facts have been rapidly accumulated, and the previous\r\ncomparative quiescence of thought on the great subject of the\r\nconstitution of the sun, has been replaced by a bewildering variety of\r\nspeculations, conjectures, and more or less justifiable inferences. It\r\nis satisfactory to find this novel impulse not only shared, but to a\r\nlarge extent guided, by our countrymen.\r\n\r\nWilliam Rutter Dawes, one of many clergymen eminent in astronomy,\r\nobserved, in 1852, with the help of a solar eye-piece of his own\r\ndevising, some curious details of spot-structure.[405] The\r\numbra--heretofore taken for the darkest part of the spot--was seen to be\r\nsuffused with a mottled, nebulous illumination, in marked contrast with\r\nthe striated appearance of the penumbra; while through this \"cloudy\r\nstratum\" a \"black opening\" permitted the eye to divine farther\r\nunfathomable depths beyond. The _hole_ thus disclosed--evidently the\r\ntrue nucleus--was found to be present in all considerable, as well as in\r\nmany small maculæ.\r\n\r\nAgain, the whirling motions of some of these objects were noticed by\r\nhim. The remarkable form of one sketched at Wateringbury, in Kent,\r\nJanuary 17, 1852, gave him the means of detecting and measuring a\r\nrotatory movement of the whole spot round the black nucleus at the rate\r\nof 100 degrees in six days. \"It appeared,\" he said, \"as if some\r\nprodigious ascending force of a whirlwind character, in bursting through\r\nthe cloudy stratum and the two higher and luminous strata, had given to\r\nthe whole a movement resembling its own.\"[406] An interpretation\r\nfounded, as is easily seen, on the Herschelian theory, then still in\r\nfull credit.\r\n\r\nAn instance of the same kind was observed by Mr. W. R. Birt in\r\n1860,[407] and cyclonic movements are now a recognised feature of\r\nsun-spots. They are, however, as Father Secchi[408] concluded from his\r\nlong experience, but temporary and casual. Scarcely three per cent. of\r\nall spots visible exhibit the spiral structure which should invariably\r\nresult if a conflict of opposing, or the friction of unequal, currents\r\nwere essential, and not merely incidental to their origin. A whirlpool\r\nphase not unfrequently accompanies their formation, and may be renewed\r\nat periods of recrudescence or dissolution; but it is both partial and\r\ninconstant, sometimes affecting only one side of a spot, sometimes\r\nslackening gradually its movement in one direction, to resume it, after\r\na brief pause, in the opposite. Persistent and uniform notions, such as\r\nthe analogy of terrestrial storms would absolutely require, are not to\r\nbe found. So that the \"cyclonic theory\" of sun-spots, suggested by\r\nHerschel in 1847,[409] and urged, from a different point of view, by\r\nFaye in 1872, may be said to have completely broken down.\r\n\r\nThe drift of spots over the sun's surface was first systematically\r\ninvestigated by Carrington, a self-constituted astronomer, gifted with\r\nthe courage and the instinct of thoughtful labour.\r\n\r\nBorn at Chelsea in May, 1826, Richard Christopher Carrington entered\r\nTrinity College, Cambridge, in 1844. He was intended for the Church, but\r\nProfessor Challis's lectures diverted him to astronomy, and he resolved,\r\nas soon as he had taken his degree, to prepare, with all possible\r\ndiligence, to follow his new vocation. His father, who was a brewer on a\r\nlarge scale at Brentford, offered no opposition; ample means were at his\r\ndisposal; nevertheless, he chose to serve an apprenticeship of three\r\nyears as observer in the University of Durham, as though his sole object\r\nhad been to earn a livelihood. He quitted the post only when he found\r\nthat its restricted opportunities offered no farther prospect of\r\nself-improvement.\r\n\r\nHe now built an observatory of his own at Redhill in Surrey, with the\r\ndesign of completing Bessel's and Argelander's survey of the northern\r\nheavens by adding to it the circumpolar stars omitted from their view.\r\nThis project, successfully carried out between 1854 and 1857, had\r\nanother and still larger one superposed upon it before it had even begun\r\nto be executed. In 1852, while the Redhill Observatory was in course of\r\nerection, the discovery of the coincidence between the sun-spot and\r\nmagnetic periods was announced. Carrington was profoundly interested,\r\nand devoted his enforced leisure to the examination of records, both\r\nwritten and depicted, of past solar observations. Struck with their\r\nfragmentary and inconsistent character, he resolved to \"appropriate,\" as\r\nhe said, by \"close and methodical research,\" the eleven-year period next\r\nensuing.[410] He calculated rightly that he should have the field pretty\r\nnearly to himself; for many reasons conspire to make public\r\nobservatories slow in taking up new subjects, and amateurs with freedom\r\nto choose, and means to treat them effectually, were scarcer then than\r\nthey are now.\r\n\r\nThe execution of this laborious task was commenced November 9, 1853. It\r\nwas intended to be merely a _parergon_--a \"second subject,\" upon which\r\ndaylight energies might be spent, while the hours of night were reserved\r\nfor cataloguing those stars that \"are bereft of the baths of ocean.\" Its\r\nresults, however, proved of the highest interest, although the\r\nvicissitudes of life barred the completion, in its full integrity, of\r\nthe original design. By the death, in 1858, of the elder Carrington, the\r\ncharge of the brewery devolved upon his son; and eventually absorbed so\r\nmuch of his care that it was found advisable to bring the solar\r\nobservations to a premature close, on March 24, 1861.\r\n\r\nHis scientific life may be said to have closed with them. Attacked four\r\nyears later with severe, and, in its results, permanent illness, he\r\ndisposed of the Brentford business, and withdrew to Churt, near Farnham,\r\nin Surrey. There, in a lonely spot, on the top of a detached conical\r\nhill known as the \"Devil's Jump,\" he built a second observatory, and\r\nerected an instrument which he was no longer able to use with pristine\r\neffectiveness; and there, November 27, 1875, he died of the rupture of a\r\nblood vessel on the brain, before he had completed his fiftieth\r\nyear.[411]\r\n\r\nHis observations of sun-spots were of a geometrical character. They\r\nconcerned positions and movements, leaving out of sight physical\r\npeculiarities. Indeed, the prudence with which he limited his task to\r\nwhat came strictly within the range of his powers to accomplish, was one\r\nof Carrington's most valuable qualities. The method of his observations,\r\nmoreover, was chosen with the same practical sagacity as their objects.\r\nAs early as 1847, Sir John Herschel had recommended the daily\r\nself-registration of sun-spots,[412] and he enforced the suggestion,\r\nwith more immediate prospect of success, in 1854.[413] The art of\r\ncelestial photography, however, was even then in a purely tentative\r\nstage, and Carrington wisely resolved to waste no time on dubious\r\nexperiments, but employ the means of registration and measurement\r\nactually at his command. These were very simple, yet very effective. To\r\nthe \"helioscope\" employed by Father Scheiner[414] two centuries and a\r\nquarter earlier, a species of micrometer was added. The image of the sun\r\nwas projected upon a screen by means of a firmly-clamped telescope, in\r\nthe focus of which were placed two cross-wires forming angles of 45°\r\nwith the meridian. The six instants were then carefully noted at which\r\nthese were met by the edges of the disc as it traversed the screen, and\r\nby the nucleus of the spot to be measured.[415] A short process of\r\ncalculation then gave the exact position of the spot as referred to the\r\nsun's centre.\r\n\r\nFrom a series of 5,290 observations made in this way, together with a\r\ngreat number of accurate drawings, Carrington derived conclusions of\r\ngreat importance on each of the three points which he had proposed to\r\nhimself to investigate. These were: the law of the sun's rotation, the\r\nexistence and direction of systematic currents, and the distribution of\r\nspots on the solar surface.\r\n\r\nGrave discrepancies were early perceived to exist between determinations\r\nof the sun's rotation by different observers. Galileo, with \"comfortable\r\ngenerality,\" estimated the period at \"about a lunar month\";[416]\r\nScheiner, at twenty-seven days.[417] Cassini, in 1678, made it 25·58;\r\nDelambre, in 1775, no more than twenty-five days. Later inquiries\r\nbrought these divergences within no more tolerable limits. Laugier's\r\nresult of 25·34 days--obtained in 1841--enjoyed the highest credit, yet\r\nit differed widely in one direction from that of Böhm (1852), giving\r\n25·52 days, and in the other from that of Kysæus (1846), giving 25·09\r\ndays. Now the cause of these variations was really obvious from the\r\nfirst, although for a long time strangely overlooked. Scheiner pointed\r\nout in 1630 that different spots gave different periods, adding the\r\nsignificant remark that one at a distance from the solar equator\r\nrevolved more slowly than those nearer to it.[418] But the hint was\r\nwasted. For upwards of two centuries ideas on the subject were either\r\nretrograde or stationary. What were called the \"proper motions\" of spots\r\nwere, however, recognised by Schröter,[419] and utterly baffled\r\nLaugier,[420] who despaired of obtaining any concordant result as to the\r\nsun's rotation except by taking the mean of a number of discordant ones.\r\nAt last, in 1855, a valuable course of observations made at Capo di\r\nMonte, Naples, in 1845-6, enabled C. H. F. Peters[421] to set in the\r\nclearest light the insecurity of determinations based on the assumption\r\nof fixity in objects plainly affected by movements uncertain both in\r\namount and direction.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of affairs when Carrington entered upon his task.\r\nEverything was in confusion; the most that could be said was that the\r\nconfusion had come to be distinctly admitted and referred to its true\r\nsource. What he discovered was this: that the sun, or at least the outer\r\nshell of the sun visible to us, has _no single period of rotation_, but\r\ndrifts round, carrying the spots with it, at a rate continually\r\naccelerated from the poles to the equator. In other words, the time of\r\naxial revolution is shortest at the equator and lengthens with increase\r\nof latitude. Carrington devised a mathematical formula by which the rate\r\nor \"law\" of this lengthening was conveniently expressed; but it was a\r\npurely empirical one. It was a concise statement, but implied no\r\nphysical interpretation. It summarised, but did not explain the facts.\r\nAn assumed \"mean period\" for the solar rotation of 25·38 days\r\n(twenty-five days nine hours, very nearly), was thus found to be\r\n_actually_ conformed to only in two parallels of solar latitude (14°\r\nnorth and south), while the equatorial period was slightly less than\r\ntwenty-five, and that of latitude 50° rose to twenty-seven days and a\r\nhalf.[422] These curious results gave quite a new direction to ideas on\r\nsolar physics.\r\n\r\nThe other two \"elements\" of the sun's rotation were also ascertained by\r\nCarrington with hitherto unattained precision. He fixed the inclination\r\nof its axis to the ecliptic at 82° 45'; the longitude of the ascending\r\nnode at 73° 40' (for the epoch 1850 A.D.). These data--which have\r\nscarcely yet been improved upon--suffice to determine the position in\r\nspace of the sun's equator. Its north pole is directed towards a star in\r\nthe coils of the Dragon, midway between Vega and the Pole-star; its\r\nplane intersects that of the earth's orbit in such a way that our planet\r\nfinds itself in the same level on or about the 3rd of June and the 5th\r\nof December, when any spots visible on the disc cross it in apparently\r\nstraight lines. At other times, the paths pursued by them seem\r\ncurved--downward (to an observer in the northern hemisphere) between\r\nJune and December, upward between December and June.\r\n\r\nA singular peculiarity in the distribution of sun-spots emerged from\r\nCarrington's studies at the time of the minimum of 1856. Two broad belts\r\nof the solar surface, as we have seen, are frequented by them, of which\r\nthe limits may be put at 6° and 35° of north and south latitude.\r\nIndividual equatorial spots are not uncommon, but nearer to the poles\r\nthan 35° they are a rare exception. Carrington observed--as an extreme\r\ninstance--in July, 1858, one in south latitude 44°; and Peters, in June,\r\n1846, watched, during several days, a spot in 50° 24' north latitude.\r\nBut beyond this no true macula has ever been seen; for Lahire's reported\r\nobservation of one in latitude 70° is now believed to have had its place\r\non the solar globe erroneously assigned; and the \"veiled spots\"\r\ndescribed by Trouvelot in 1875[423] as occurring within 10° of the pole\r\ncan only be regarded as, at the most, the same kind of disturbance in an\r\nundeveloped form.\r\n\r\nBut the novelty of Carrington's observations consisted in the detection\r\nof certain changes in distribution concurrent with the progress of the\r\neleven-year period. As the minimum approached, the spot-zones contracted\r\ntowards the equator, and there finally vanished; then, as if by a fresh\r\nimpulse, spots suddenly reappeared in high latitude, and spread\r\ndownwards with the development of the new phase of activity. Scarcely\r\nhad this remark been made public,[424] when Wolf[425] found a\r\nconfirmation of its general truth in Böhm's observations during the\r\nyears 1833-36; and a perfectly similar behaviour was noted both by\r\nSpörer and Secchi at the minimum epoch of 1867. The ensuing period gave\r\ncorresponding indications; and it may now be looked upon as established\r\nthat the spot-zones close in towards the equator with the advance of\r\neach cycle, their activity culminating, as a rule, in a mean latitude of\r\nabout 16°, and expiring when it is reduced to 6°. Before this happens,\r\nhowever, a completely new disturbance will have manifested itself some\r\n35° north and south of the equator, and will have begun to travel over\r\nthe same course as its predecessor. Each series of sun-spots is thus, to\r\nsome extent, overlapped by the succeeding one; so that while the average\r\ninterval from one maximum to the next is eleven years, the period of\r\neach distinct wave of agitation is twelve or fourteen.[426] Curious\r\nevidence of the retarded character of the maximum of 1883-4 was to be\r\nfound in the unusually low latitude of the spot-zones when it occurred.\r\nTheir movement downward having gone on regularly while the crisis was\r\npostponed, its final symptoms were hence displaced locally as well as in\r\ntime. The \"law of zones\" was duly obeyed at the minima of 1890[427] and\r\n1901, and Spörer found evidence of conformity to it so far back as\r\n1619.[428] His researches, however, also showed that it was in abeyance\r\nduring some seventy years previously to 1716, during which period\r\nsun-spots remained persistently scarce, and auroral displays were feeble\r\nand infrequent even in high northern latitudes. An unaccountable\r\nsuspension of solar activity is, in fact, indicated.[429]\r\n\r\nGustav Spörer, born at Berlin in 1822, began to observe sun-spots with\r\nthe view of assigning the law of solar rotation in December, 1860. His\r\nassiduity and success with limited means attracted attention, and a\r\nGovernment endowment was procured for his little solar observatory at\r\nAnclam, in Pomerania, the Crown Prince (afterwards Emperor Frederick)\r\nadding a five-inch refractor to its modest equipment. Unaware of\r\nCarrington's discovery (not made known until January, 1859), he arrived\r\nat and published, in June, 1861,[430] a similar conclusion as to the\r\nequatorial quickening of the sun's movement on its axis. Appointed\r\nobserver in the new Astrophysical establishment at Potsdam in 1874, he\r\ncontinued his sun-spot determinations there for twenty years, and died\r\nJuly 7, 1895.\r\n\r\nThe time had now evidently come for a fundamental revision of current\r\nnotions respecting the nature of the sun. Herschel's theory of a cool,\r\ndark, habitable globe, surrounded by, and protected against, the\r\nradiations of a luminous and heat-giving envelope, was shattered by the\r\nfirst _dicta_ of spectrum analysis. Traces of it may be found for a few\r\nyears subsequent to 1859,[431] but they are obviously survivals from an\r\nearlier order of ideas, doomed to speedy extinction. It needs only a\r\nmoment's consideration of the meaning at last found for the Fraunhofer\r\nlines to see the incompatibility of the new facts with the old\r\nconceptions. They implied not only the presence near the sun, as glowing\r\nvapours, of bodies highly refractory to heat, but that these glowing\r\nvapours formed the relatively cool envelope of a still hotter internal\r\nmass. Kirchhoff, accordingly, included in his great memoir \"On the Solar\r\nSpectrum,\" read before the Berlin Academy of Sciences, July 11, 1861, an\r\nexposition of the views on the subject to which his memorable\r\ninvestigations had led him. They may be briefly summarised as follows:\r\n\r\nSince the body of the sun gives a continuous spectrum, it must be either\r\nsolid or liquid,[432] while the interruptions in its light prove it to\r\nbe surrounded by a complex atmosphere of metallic vapours, somewhat\r\ncooler than itself. Spots are simply clouds due to local depressions of\r\ntemperature, differing in no respect from terrestrial clouds except as\r\nregards the kinds of matter composing them. These _sun-clouds_ take\r\ntheir origin in the zones of encounter between polar and equatorial\r\ncurrents in the solar atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThis explanation was liable to all the objections urged against the\r\n\"cumulus theory\" on the one hand, and the \"trade-wind theory\" on the\r\nother. Setting aside its propounder, it was consistently upheld perhaps\r\nby no man eminent in science except Spörer; and his advocacy of it\r\nproved ineffective to secure its general adoption.\r\n\r\nM. Faye, of the Paris Academy of Sciences, was the first to propose a\r\ncoherent scheme of the solar constitution covering the whole range of\r\nnew discovery. The fundamental ideas on the subject now in vogue here\r\nmade their first connected appearance. Much, indeed, remained to be\r\nmodified and corrected; but the transition was finally made from the old\r\nto the new order of thought. The essence of the change may be conveyed\r\nin a single sentence. The sun was thenceforth regarded, not as a mere\r\nheated body, or--still more remotely from the truth--as a cool body\r\nunaccountably spun round with a cocoon of fire, but as a vast\r\n_heat-radiating machine_. The terrestrial analogy was abandoned in one\r\nmore particular besides that of temperature. The solar system of\r\ncirculation, instead of being adapted, like that of the earth, to the\r\ndistribution of heat received from without, was seen to be directed\r\ntowards the transportation towards the surface of the heat contained\r\nwithin. Polar and equatorial currents, tending to a purely superficial\r\nequalisation of temperature, were replaced by vertical currents bringing\r\nup successive portions of the intensely heated interior mass, to\r\ncontribute their share in turn to the radiation into space which might\r\nbe called the proper function of a sun.\r\n\r\nFaye's views, which were communicated to the Academy of Sciences,\r\nJanuary 16, 1865,[433] were avowedly based on the anomalous mode of\r\nsolar rotation discovered by Carrington. This may be regarded either as\r\nan acceleration increasing from the poles to the equator, or as a\r\nretardation increasing from the equator to the poles, according to the\r\nrate of revolution we choose to assume for the unseen nucleus. Faye\r\npreferred to consider it a retardation produced by ascending currents\r\ncontinually left behind as the sphere widened in which the matter\r\ncomposing them was forced to travel. He further supposed that the depth\r\nfrom which these vertical currents rose, and consequently the amount of\r\nretardation effected by their ascent to the surface, became\r\nprogressively greater as the poles were approached, owing to the\r\nconsiderable flattening of the spheroidal surface from which they\r\nstarted;[434] but the adoption of this expedient has been shown to\r\ninvolve inadmissible consequences.\r\n\r\nThe extreme internal mobility betrayed by Carrington's and Spörer's\r\nobservations led to the inference that the matter composing the sun was\r\nmainly or wholly gaseous. This had already been suggested by Father\r\nSecchi[435] a year earlier, and by Sir John Herschel in April,\r\n1864;[436] but it first obtained general currency through Faye's more\r\nelaborate presentation. A physical basis was afforded for the view by\r\nCagniard de la Tour's experiments in 1822,[437] proving that, under\r\nconditions of great heat and pressure, the vaporous state was compatible\r\nwith a very considerable density. The position was strengthened when\r\nAndrews showed, in 1869,[438] that above a fixed limit of temperature,\r\nvarying for different bodies, true liquefaction is impossible, even\r\nthough the pressure be so tremendous as to retain the gas within the\r\nsame space that enclosed the liquid. The opinion that the mass of the\r\nsun is gaseous now commands a very general assent; although the gaseity\r\nadmitted is of such a nature as to afford the consistence rather of\r\nhoney or pitch than of the aeriform fluids with which we are familiar.\r\n\r\nOn another important point the course of subsequent thought was\r\npowerfully influenced by Faye's conclusions in 1865. Arago somewhat\r\nhastily inferred from experiments with the polariscope the wholly\r\ngaseous nature of the visible disc of the sun. Kirchhoff, on the\r\ncontrary, believed (erroneously, as we now know) that the brilliant\r\ncontinuous spectrum derived from it proved it to be a white-hot solid or\r\nliquid. Herschel and Secchi[439] indicated a cloud-like structure as\r\nthat which would best harmonise the whole of the evidence at command.\r\nThe novelty introduced by Faye consisted in regarding the photosphere no\r\nlonger \"as a defined surface, in the mathematical sense, but as a limit\r\nto which, in the general fluid mass, ascending currents carry the\r\nphysical or chemical phenomena of incandescence.\"[440] Uprushing floods\r\nof mixed vapours with strong affinities--say of calcium or sodium and\r\noxygen--at last attain a region cool enough to permit their combination;\r\na fine dust of solid or liquid compound particles (of lime or soda, for\r\nexample) there collects into the photospheric clouds, and descending by\r\nits own weight in torrents of incandescent rain, is dissociated by the\r\nfierce heat below, and replaced by ascending and combining currents of\r\nsimilar constitution.\r\n\r\nThis first attempt to assign the part played in cosmical physics by\r\nchemical affinities was marked by the importation into the theory of the\r\nsun of the now familiar phrase _dissociation_. It is indeed tolerably\r\ncertain that no such combinations as those contemplated by Faye occur at\r\nthe photospheric level, since the temperature there must be enormously\r\nhigher than would be needed to reduce all metallic earths and oxides;\r\nbut molecular changes of some kind, dependent perhaps in part upon\r\nelectrical conditions, in part upon the effects of radiation into space,\r\nmost likely replace them. The conjecture was emitted by Dr. Johnstone\r\nStoney in 1867[441] that the photospheric clouds are composed of\r\ncarbon-particles precipitated from their mounting vapour just where the\r\ntemperature is lowered by expansion and radiation to the boiling-point\r\nof that substance. But this view, though countenanced by Ångström,[442]\r\nand advocated by Hastings of Baltimore,[443] and other authorities,[444]\r\nis open to grave objections.[445]\r\n\r\nIn Faye's theory, sun-spots were regarded as simply breaks in the\r\nphotospheric clouds, where the rising currents had strength to tear them\r\nasunder. It followed that they were regions of increased heat--regions,\r\nin fact, where the temperature was too high to permit the occurrence of\r\nthe precipitations to which the photosphere is due. Their obscurity was\r\nattributed, as in Dr. Brester's more recent _Théorie du Soleil_, to\r\ndeficiency of emissive power. Yet here the verdict of the spectroscope\r\nis adverse and irreversible.\r\n\r\nAfter every deduction, however, has been made, we still find that\r\nseveral ideas of permanent value were embodied in this comprehensive\r\nsketch of the solar constitution. The principal of these were; first,\r\nthat the sun is a mainly gaseous body; secondly, that its stores of heat\r\nare rendered available at the surface by means of vertical\r\nconvection-currents--by the bodily transport, that is to say, of\r\nintensely hot matter upward, and of comparatively cool matter downward;\r\nthirdly, that the photosphere is a surface of condensation, forming the\r\nlimit set by the cold of space to this circulating process, and that a\r\nsimilar formation must attend, at a certain stage, the cooling of every\r\ncosmical body.\r\n\r\nTo Warren de la Rue belongs the honour of having obtained the earliest\r\nresults of substantial value in celestial photography. What had been\r\ndone previously was interesting in the way of promise, but much could\r\nnot be claimed for it as actual performance. Some \"pioneering\r\nexperiments\" were made by Dr. J. W. Draper of New York in 1840,\r\nresulting in the production of a few \"moon-pictures\" one inch in\r\ndiameter;[446] but slight encouragement was derived from them, either to\r\nhimself or others. Bond of Cambridge (U.S.), however, secured in 1850\r\nwith the Harvard 15-inch refractor that daguerreotype of the moon with\r\nwhich the career of extra-terrestrial photography may be said to have\r\nformally opened. It was shown in London at the Great Exhibition of 1851,\r\nand determined the direction of De la Rue's efforts. Yet it did little\r\nmore than prove the art to be a possible one.\r\n\r\nWarren de la Rue was born in Guernsey in 1815, and died in London April\r\n19, 1889. Educated at the École Sainte-Barbe in Paris, he made a large\r\nfortune as a paper manufacturer in England, and thus amply and early\r\nprovided the material supplies for his scientific campaign. Towards the\r\nend of 1853 he took some successful lunar photographs. They were\r\nremarkable as the first examples of the application to astronomical\r\nlight-painting of the collodion process, invented by Archer in 1851; and\r\nalso of the use of reflectors (De la Rue's was one of thirteen inches,\r\nconstructed by himself) for that kind of work. The absence of a driving\r\napparatus was, however, very sensibly felt; the difficulty of moving the\r\ninstrument by hand so as accurately to follow the moon's apparent motion\r\nbeing such as to cause the discontinuance of the experiments until 1857,\r\nwhen the want was supplied. De la Rue's new observatory, built in that\r\nyear at Cranford, was expressly dedicated to celestial photography; and\r\nthere he applied to the heavenly bodies the stereoscopic method of\r\nobtaining relief, and turned his attention to the delicate business of\r\nphotographing the sun.\r\n\r\nA solar daguerreotype was taken at Paris, April 2, 1845,[447] by\r\nFoucault and Fizeau, acting on a suggestion from Arago. But the attempt,\r\nthough far from being unsuccessful, does not, at that time, seem to have\r\nbeen repeated. Its great difficulty consisted in the enormous\r\nlight-power of the object to be represented, rendering an inconceivably\r\nshort period of exposure indispensable, under pain of getting completely\r\n\"burnt-up\" plates. In 1857 De la Rue was commissioned by the Royal\r\nSociety to construct an instrument specially adapted to the purpose for\r\nthe Kew Observatory. The resulting \"photoheliograph\" may be described as\r\na small telescope (of 3-1/2 inches aperture and 50 focus), with a\r\nplate-holder at the eye-end, guarded in front by a spring-slide, the\r\nrapid movement of which across the field of view secured for the\r\nsensitive plate a virtually instantaneous exposure. By its means the\r\nfirst solar light-pictures of real value were taken, and the autographic\r\nrecord of the solar condition recommended by Sir John Herschel was\r\ncommenced and continued at Kew during fourteen years--1858-72. The work\r\nof photographing the sun is now carried on in every quarter of the\r\nglobe, from Mauritius to Massachusetts, and the days are few indeed on\r\nwhich the self-betrayal of the camera can be evaded by our chief\r\nluminary. In the year 1883 the incorporation of Indian with Greenwich\r\npictures afforded a record of the state of the solar surface on 340\r\ndays; and 364 were similarly provided for in 1897 and 1899.\r\n\r\nThe conclusions arrived at by photographic means at Kew were\r\ncommunicated to the Royal Society in a series of papers drawn up jointly\r\nby De la Rue, Balfour Stewart, and Benjamin Loewy, in 1865 and\r\nsubsequent years. They influenced materially the progress of thought on\r\nthe subject they were concerned with.\r\n\r\nBy its rotation the sun itself offers opportunities for bringing the\r\nstereoscope to bear upon it. Two pictures, taken at an interval of\r\ntwenty-six minutes, show just the amount of difference needed to give,\r\nby their combination, the maximum effect of solidity.[448] De la Rue\r\nthus obtained, in 1861, a stereoscopic view of a sun-spot and\r\nsurrounding faculæ, representing the various parts in their true mutual\r\nrelations. \"I have ascertained in this way,\" he wrote,[449] \"that the\r\nfaculæ occupy the highest portions of the sun's photosphere, the spots\r\nappearing like holes in the penumbræ, which appeared lower than the\r\nregions surrounding them; in one case, parts of the faculæ were\r\ndiscovered to be sailing over a spot apparently at some considerable\r\nheight above it.\" Thus Wilson's inference as to the depressed nature of\r\nspots received, after the lapse of not far from a century, proof of the\r\nmost simple, direct, and convincing kind. A careful application of\r\nWilson's own geometrical test gave results only a trifle less decisive.\r\nOf 694 spots observed, 78 per cent. showed, as they traversed the disc,\r\nthe expected effects of perspective;[450] and their absence in the\r\nremaining 22 per cent. might be explained by internal commotions\r\nproducing irregularities of structure. The absolute depth of\r\nspot-cavities--at least of their sloping sides--was determined by Father\r\nSecchi through measurement of the \"parallax of profundity\"[451]--that\r\nis, of apparent displacements attendant on the sun's rotation, due to\r\ndepression below the sun's surface. He found that in every case it fell\r\nshort of 4,000 miles, and averaged not more than 1,321, corresponding,\r\non the terrestrial scale, to an excavation in the earth's crust of 1-1/5\r\nmiles. Of late, however, the reality of even this moderate amount of\r\ndepression has been denied. Mr. Howlett's persevering observations,\r\nextending over a third of a century, the results of which were presented\r\nto the Royal Astronomical Society in December, 1894,[452] availed to\r\nshatter the consensus of opinion which had so long been maintained on\r\nthe subject of spot-structure.[453] It has become impossible any longer\r\nto hold that it is uniformly cavernous; and what seem like actually\r\nprotruding umbræ are occasionally vouched for on unimpeachable\r\nauthority.[454] We can only infer that the forms of sun-spots are really\r\nmore various than had been supposed; that they are peculiarly subject to\r\ndisturbance; and that the level of the nuclei may rise and fall during\r\nthe phases of commotion, like lavas within volcanic craters.\r\n\r\nThe opinion of the Kew observers as to the nature of such disturbances\r\nwas strongly swayed by another curious result of the \"statistical\r\nmethod\" of inquiry. They found that of 1,137 instances of spots\r\naccompanied by faculæ, 584 had those faculæ chiefly or entirely on the\r\nleft, 508 showed a nearly equal distribution, while 45 only had faculous\r\nappendages mainly on the right side.[455] Now the rotation of the sun,\r\nas we see it, is performed from left to right; so that the marked\r\ntendency of the faculæ was a lagging one. This was easily accounted for\r\nby supposing the matter composing them to have been flung upwards from a\r\nconsiderable depth, whence it would reach the surface with the lesser\r\n_absolute_ velocity belonging to a smaller circle of revolution, and\r\nwould consequently fall behind the cavities or \"spots\" formed by its\r\nabstraction. An attempt, it is true, made by M. Wilsing at Potsdam in\r\n1888[456] to determine the solar rotation from photographs of faculæ had\r\nan outcome inconsistent with this view of their origin. They\r\nunexpectedly gave a uniform period. No trace of the retardation poleward\r\nfrom the equator, shown by the spots, could be detected in their\r\nmovements. But the experiment was obviously inconclusive;[457] and M.\r\nStratonoff's[458] repetition of it with ampler materials gave a full\r\nassurance that faculæ rotate like spots in periods lengthening as\r\nlatitude augments.\r\n\r\nThe ideas of M. Faye were, on two fundamental points, contradicated by\r\nthe Kew investigators. He held spots to be regions of _uprush_ and of\r\nheightened temperature; they believed their obscurity to be due to a\r\n_downrush_ of comparatively cool vapours. Now M. Chacornac, observing,\r\nat Ville-Urbanne, March 6, 1865, saw floods of photospheric matter\r\nvisibly precipitating themselves into the abyss opened by a great spot,\r\nand carrying with them small neighbouring maculæ.[459] Similar instances\r\nwere repeatedly noted by Father Secchi, who considered the existence of\r\na kind of _suction_ in spots to be quite beyond question.[460] The\r\ntendency in their vicinity, to put it otherwise, is _centripetal_, not\r\n_centrifugal_; and this alone seems to negative the supposition of a\r\ncentral uprush.\r\n\r\nA fresh witness was by this time at hand. The application of the\r\nspectroscope to the direct examination of the sun's surface dates from\r\nMarch 4, 1866, when Sir Norman Lockyer (to give him his present title)\r\nundertook an inquiry into the cause of the darkening in spots.[461] It\r\nwas made possible by the simple device of throwing upon the slit of the\r\nspectroscope an _image_ of the sun, any part of which could be subjected\r\nto special scrutiny, instead of, as had hitherto been done, admitting\r\nrays from every portion of his surface indiscriminately. The answer to\r\nthe inquiry was prompt and unmistakable, and was again, in this case,\r\nadverse to the French theorist's view. The obscurations in question were\r\nfound to be produced by no deficiency of emissive power, but by an\r\nincrease of absorptive action. The background of variegated light\r\nremains unchanged, but more of it is stopped by the interposition of a\r\ndense mass of relatively cool vapours. The spectrum of a sun-spot is\r\ncrossed by the same set of multitudinous dark lines, with some minor\r\ndifferences, visible in the ordinary solar spectrum. We must then\r\nconclude that the same vapours (speaking generally) which are dispersed\r\nover the unbroken solar surface are accumulated in the umbral cavity,\r\nthe compression incident to such accumulation being betrayed by the\r\nthickening of certain lines of absorption. But there is also a general\r\nabsorption, extending almost continuously from one end of the\r\nspot-spectrum to the other. Using, however, a spectroscope of\r\nexceptionally high dispersive power, Professor Young of Princeton, New\r\nJersey, succeeded in 1883 in \"resolving\" the supposed continuous\r\nobscurity of spot-spectra into a countless multitude of fine dark lines\r\nset very close together.[462] Their structure was seen still more\r\nperfectly, about five years later, by M. Dunér,[463] Director of the\r\nUpsala Observatory, who traced besides some shadowy vestiges of the\r\ncrowded doublets and triplets forming the array, from the spots on to\r\nthe general solar surface. They cease to be separable in the blue part\r\nof the spectrum; and the ultra-violet radiations of spots show nothing\r\ndistinctive.[464]\r\n\r\nAs to the movements of the constipated vapours forming spots, the\r\nspectroscope is also competent to supply information. The principle of\r\nthe method by which it is procured will be explained farther on. Suffice\r\nit here to say that the transport, at any considerable velocity, to or\r\nfrom the eye of the gaseous material giving bright or dark lines, can be\r\nmeasured by the displacement of such lines from their previously known\r\nnormal positions. In this way movements have been detected in or above\r\nspots of enormous rapidity, ranging up to 320 _miles per second_. But\r\nthe result, so far, has been to negative the ascription to them of any\r\nsystematic direction. Uprushes and downrushes are doubtless, as Father\r\nCortie remarks,[465] \"correlated phenomena in the production of a\r\nsun-spot\"; but neither seem to predominate as part of its regular\r\ninternal economy.\r\n\r\nThe same kind of spectroscopic evidence tells heavily against a theory\r\nof sun-spots started by Faye in 1872. He had been foremost in pointing\r\nout that the observations of Carrington and Spörer absolutely forbade\r\nthe supposition that any phenomenon at all resembling our trade-winds\r\nexists in the sun. They showed, indeed, that beyond the parallels of 20°\r\nthere is a general tendency in spots to a slow poleward displacement,\r\nwhile within that zone they incline to approach the equator; but their\r\n\"proper movements\" gave no evidence of uniformly flowing currents in\r\nlatitude. The systematic drift of the photosphere is strictly a drift in\r\nlongitude; its direction is everywhere parallel to the equator. This\r\nfact being once clearly recognised, the \"solar tornado\" hypothesis at\r\nonce fell to pieces; but M. Faye[466] perceived another source of\r\nvorticose motion in the unequal rotating velocities of contiguous\r\nportions of the photosphere. The \"pores\" with which the whole surface of\r\nthe sun is studded he took to be the smaller eddies resulting from these\r\ninequalities; the spots to be such eddies developed into whirlpools. It\r\nonly needs to thrust a stick into a stream to produce the kind of effect\r\ndesignated. And it happens that the differences of angular movement\r\nadverted to attain a maximum just about the latitudes where spots are\r\nmost frequent and conspicuous.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, grave difficulties in identifying the two kinds of\r\nphenomena. One (already mentioned) is the total absence of the regular\r\nswirling motion--in a direction contrary to that of the hands of a watch\r\nnorth of the solar equator, in the opposite sense south of it--which\r\nshould impress itself upon every lineament of a sun-spot if the cause\r\nassigned were a primary producing, and not merely (as it possibly may\r\nbe) a secondary determining one. The other, pointed out by Young,[467]\r\nis that the cause is inadequate to the effect. The difference of\r\nmovement, or _relative drift_, supposed to occasion such prodigious\r\ndisturbances, amounts, at the utmost, for two portions of the\r\nphotosphere 123 miles apart, to about five yards a minute. Thus the\r\nfriction of contiguous sections must be quite insignificant.\r\n\r\nA view better justified by observation was urged by Secchi in and after\r\nthe year 1872, and was presented in an improved form by Professor Young\r\nin his excellent little book on _The Sun_, published in 1882.[468] Spots\r\nare manifestly associated with violent eruptive action, giving rise to\r\nthe faculæ and prominences which usually garnish their borders. It is\r\naccordingly contended that upon the withdrawal of matter from below by\r\nthe flinging up of a prominence must ensue a sinking-in of the surface,\r\ninto which the partially cooled erupted vapours rush and settle,\r\nproducing just the kind of darkening by increased absorption told of by\r\nthe spectroscope. Round the edges of the cavity the rupture of the\r\nphotospheric shell will form lines of weakness provocative of further\r\neruptions, which will, in their turn, deepen and enlarge the cavity. The\r\nphenomenon thus tends to perpetuate itself, until equilibrium is at last\r\nrestored by internal processes. A sun-spot might then be described as an\r\ninverted terrestrial volcano, in which the outbursts of heated matter\r\ntake place on the borders instead of at the centre of the crater, while\r\nthe cooled products gather in the centre instead of at the borders.\r\n\r\nBut on the earth, the solid crust forcibly represses the steam gathering\r\nbeneath until it has accumulated strength for an explosion, while there\r\nis no such restraining power that we know of in the sun. Zöllner,\r\nindeed, adapted his theory of the solar constitution to the special\r\npurpose of procuring it; yet with very partial success, since almost\r\nevery new fact has proved adverse to his assumptions. Volcanic action is\r\nessentially spasmodic. It implies habitual constraint varied by\r\ntemporary outbreaks, inconceivable in a gaseous globe, such as we\r\nbelieve the sun to be.\r\n\r\nIf the \"volcanic hypothesis\" represented the truth, no spot could\r\npossibly appear without a precedent eruption. The real order of the\r\nphenomenon, however, is exceedingly difficult to ascertain; nor is it\r\nperhaps invariable. Although, in most cases, the \"opening\" shows first,\r\nthat may be simply because it is more easily seen. According to Father\r\nSidgreaves,[469] the disturbance has then already passed the incipient\r\nstage. He considers it indeed \"highly probable that the preparatory sign\r\nof a new spot is always a small, bright patch of facula.\"\r\n\r\nThis sequence, if established, would be fatal to Lockyer's theory of\r\nsun-spots, communicated to the Royal Society, May 6, 1886,[470] and\r\nfurther developed some months later in his work on _The Chemistry of the\r\nSun_. Spots are represented in it as incidental to a vast system of\r\nsolar atmospheric circulation, starting with the polar out- and up-flows\r\nindicated by observations during some total eclipses, and eventuating in\r\nthe plunge downward from great heights upon the photosphere of\r\nprodigious masses of condensed materials. From these falls result,\r\nprimarily, spots; secondarily, through the answering uprushes in which\r\nchemical and mechanical forces co-operate, their girdles of\r\nflame-prominences. The evidence is, however, slight that such a\r\ncirculatory flow as would be needed to maintain this supposed cycle of\r\noccurrences really prevails in the sun's atmosphere; and a similar\r\nobjection applies to an \"anticyclonic theory\" (so to designate it)\r\nelaborated by Egon von Oppolzer in 1893.[471] August Schmidt's optical\r\nrationale of solar phenomena[472] was, on the other hand, a complete\r\nnovelty, both in principle and development. Attractive to speculators\r\nfrom its recondite nature and far-reaching scope, it by no means\r\ncommended itself to practical observers, intolerant of finding the all\r\nbut palpable realities of their daily experience dealt with as illusory\r\nproducts of \"circular refraction.\"\r\n\r\nA singular circumstance has now to be recounted. On the 1st of\r\nSeptember, 1859, while Carrington was engaged in his daily work of\r\nmeasuring the positions of sun-spots, he was startled by the sudden\r\nappearance of two patches of peculiarly intense light within the area of\r\nthe largest group visible. His first idea was that a ray of unmitigated\r\nsunshine had penetrated the screen employed to reduce the brilliancy of\r\nthe image; but, having quickly convinced himself to the contrary, he ran\r\nto summon an additional witness of an unmistakably remarkable\r\noccurrence. On his return he was disappointed to find the strange\r\nluminous outburst already on the wane; shortly afterwards the last trace\r\nvanished. Its entire duration was five minutes--from 11.18 to 11.23\r\nA.M., Greenwich time; and during those five minutes it had traversed a\r\nspace estimated at 35,000 miles! No perceptible change took place in the\r\ndetails of the group of spots visited by this transitory conflagration,\r\nwhich, it was accordingly inferred, took place at a considerable height\r\nabove it.[473]\r\n\r\nCarrington's account was precisely confirmed by an observation made at\r\nHighgate. Mr. R. Hodgson described the appearance seen by him as that\r\n\"of a very brilliant star of light, much brighter than the sun's\r\nsurface, most dazzling to the protected eye, illuminating the upper\r\nedges of the adjacent spots and streaks, not unlike in effect the edging\r\nof the clouds at sunset.\"[474]\r\n\r\nThis unique phenomenon seemed as if specially designed to accentuate\r\nthe inference of a sympathetic relation between the earth and the sun.\r\nFrom the 28th of August to the 4th of September, 1859, a magnetic\r\nstorm of unparalleled intensity, extent, and duration, was in progress\r\nover the entire globe. Telegraphic communication was everywhere\r\ninterrupted--except, indeed, that it was, in some cases, found\r\npracticable to work the lines _without batteries_, by the agency of\r\nthe earth-currents alone:[475] sparks issued from the wires; gorgeous\r\nauroræ draped the skies in solemn crimson over both hemispheres, and\r\neven within the tropics; the magnetic needle lost all trace of\r\ncontinuity in its movements, and darted to and fro as if stricken with\r\ninexplicable panic. The coincidence was drawn even closer. _At the\r\nvery instant_[476] of the solar outburst witnessed by Carrington and\r\nHodgson, the photographic apparatus at Kew registered a marked\r\ndisturbance of all the three magnetic elements; while, shortly after\r\nthe ensuing midnight, the electric agitation culminated, thrilling the\r\nearth with subtle vibrations, and lighting up the atmosphere from pole\r\nto pole with the coruscating splendours which, perhaps, dimly recall\r\nthe times when our ancient planet itself shone as a star.\r\n\r\nHere then, at least, the sun was--in Professor Balfour Stewart's\r\nphrase--\"taken in the act\"[477] of stirring up terrestrial commotions.\r\nNor have instances since been wanting of an indubitable connection\r\nbetween outbreaks of individual spots and magnetic disturbances. Four\r\nsuch were registered in 1882; and symptoms of the same kind, including\r\nthe beautiful \"Rose Aurora,\" marked the progress across the sun of the\r\nenormous spot-group of February, 1892--the largest ever recorded at\r\nGreenwich. This extraordinary formation, which covered about 1/300 of\r\nthe sun's disc, survived through five complete rotations.[478] It was\r\nremarkable for a persistent drift in latitude, its place altering\r\nprogressively from 17° to 30° south of the solar equator.\r\n\r\nAgain, the central passage of an enormous spot on September 9, 1898,\r\nsynchronised with a sharp magnetic disturbance and brilliant\r\naurora;[479] and the coincidence was substantially repeated in March,\r\n1899,[480] when it was emphasised by the prevalent cosmic calm. The\r\ntheory of the connection is indeed far from clear. Lord Kelvin, in\r\n1892,[481] pronounced against the possibility of any direct magnetic\r\naction by the sun upon the earth, on the ground of its involving an\r\nextravagant output of energy; but the fact is unquestionable that--in\r\nProfessor Bigelow's words--\"abnormal agitations affect the sun and the\r\nearth as a whole and at the same time.\"[482]\r\n\r\nThe nearer approach to the event of September 1, 1859, was\r\nphotographically observed by Professor George E. Hale at Chicago, July\r\n15, 1892.[483] An active spot in the southern hemisphere was the scene\r\nof this curiously sudden manifestation. During an interval of 12m.\r\nbetween two successive exposures, a bridge of dazzling light was found\r\nto have spanned the boundary-line dividing the twin-nuclei of the spot;\r\nand these, after another 27m., were themselves almost obliterated by an\r\noverflow of far-spreading brilliancy. Yet two hours later, no trace of\r\nthe outburst remained, the spot and its attendant faculæ remaining just\r\nas they had been previously to its occurrence. Unlike that seen by\r\nCarrington, it was accompanied by no exceptional magnetic phenomena,\r\nalthough a \"storm\" set in next day.[484] Possibly a terrestrial analogue\r\nto the former might be discovered in the \"auroral beam\" which traversed\r\nthe heavens during a vivid display of polar lights, November 17, 1882,\r\nand shared, there is every reason to believe, their electrical origin\r\nand character.[485]\r\n\r\nMeantime M. Rudolf Wolf, transferred to the direction of the Zürich\r\nObservatory, where he died, December 6, 1893, had relaxed none of his\r\nzeal in the investigation of sun-spot periodicity. A laborious revision\r\nof the entire subject with the aid of fresh materials led him, in\r\n1859,[486] to the conclusion that while the _mean_ period differed\r\nlittle from that arrived at in 1852 of 11.11 years, very considerable\r\nfluctuations on either side of that mean were rather the rule than the\r\nexception. Indeed, the phrase \"sun-spot period\" must be understood as\r\nfitting very loosely the great fact it is taken to represent; so\r\nloosely, that the interval between two maxima may rise to sixteen and a\r\nhalf or sink below seven and a half years.[487] In 1861[488] Wolf\r\nshowed, and the remark was fully confirmed at Kew, that the shortest\r\nperiods brought the most acute crises, and _vice versâ_; as if for each\r\nwave of disturbance a strictly equal amount of energy were available,\r\nwhich might spend itself lavishly and rapidly, or slowly and\r\nparsimoniously, but could in no case be exceeded. The further inclusion\r\nof recurring solar commotions within a cycle of fifty-five and a half\r\nyears was simultaneously pointed out; and Hermann Fritz showed soon\r\nafterwards that the aurora borealis is subject to an identical double\r\nperiodicity.[489] The same inquirer has more recently detected both for\r\nauroræ and sun-spots a \"secular period\" of 222 years,[490] and the Kew\r\nobservations indicate for the latter, oscillations accomplished within\r\ntwenty-six and twenty-four days,[491] depending, most likely, upon the\r\nrotation of the sun. This is certainly reflected in magnetic, and\r\nperhaps in auroral periodicity. The more closely, in fact,\r\nspot-fluctuations are looked into, the more complex they prove. Maxima\r\nof one order are superposed upon, or in part neutralised by, maxima of\r\nanother order;[492] originating causes are masked by modifying causes;\r\nthe larger waves of the commotion are indented with minor undulations,\r\nand these again crisped with tiny ripples, while the whole rises and\r\nfalls with the swell of the great secular wave, scarcely perceptible in\r\nits progress because so vast in scale.\r\n\r\nThe idea that solar maculation depends in some way upon the position of\r\nthe planets occurred to Galileo in 1612.[493] It has been industriously\r\nsifted by a whole bevy of modern solar physicists. Wolf in 1859[494]\r\nfound reason to believe that the eleven-year curve is determined by the\r\naction of Jupiter, modified by that of Saturn, and diversified by\r\ninfluences proceeding from the earth and Venus. Its tempting approach to\r\nagreement with Jupiter's period of revolution round the sun, indeed,\r\nirresistibly suggested a causal connection; yet it does not seem that\r\nthe most skilful \"coaxing\" of figures can bring about a fundamental\r\nharmony. Carrington pointed out in 1863, that while, during _eight\r\nsuccessive periods_, from 1770 downwards, there were approximate\r\ncoincidences between Jupiter's aphelion passages and sun-spot maxima,\r\nthe relation had been almost exactly reversed in the two periods\r\npreceding that date;[495] and Wolf himself finally concluded that the\r\nJovian origin must be abandoned.[496] M. Duponchel's[497] prediction,\r\nnevertheless, of an abnormal retardation of the maximum due in 1881\r\nthrough certain peculiarities in the positions of Uranus and Neptune\r\nabout the time it fell due, was partially verified by the event, since,\r\nafter an abortive phase of agitation in April, 1882, the final outburst\r\nwas postponed to January, 1894. The interval was thus 13.5 instead of\r\n11.1 years; and it is noticeable that the delay affected chiefly the\r\nsouthern hemisphere. Alternations of activity in the solar hemispheres\r\nwere indeed a marked feature of the maximum of 1884, which, in M. Faye's\r\nview,[498] derived thence its indecisive character, while sharp, strong\r\ncrises arise with the simultaneous advance of agitation north and south\r\nof the solar equator. The curve of magnetic disturbance followed with\r\nits usual strict fidelity the anomalous fluctuations of the sun-spot\r\ncurve. The ensuing minimum occurred early in 1889, and was succeeded in\r\n1894 by a maximum slightly less feeble than its predecessor.[499]\r\n\r\nIt cannot be said that much progress has been made towards the\r\ndisclosure of the cause, or causes, of the sun-spot cycle. No external\r\ninfluence adequate to the effect has, at any rate, yet been pointed out.\r\nMost thinkers on this difficult subject provide a quasi-explanation of\r\nthe periodicity in question through certain assumed vicissitudes\r\naffecting internal processes;[500] Sir Norman Lockyer and E. von\r\nOppolzer reach the same end by establishing self-compensatory\r\nfluctuations in the solar atmospheric circulation; Dr. Schuster resorts\r\nto changes in the electrical conductivity of space near the sun.[501] In\r\nall these theories, however, the course of transition is arbitrarily\r\narranged to suit a period, which imposes itself as a fact peremptorily\r\nclaiming admittance, while obstinately defying explanation.\r\n\r\nThe question so much discussed, as to the influence of sun-spots on\r\nweather, does not admit of a satisfactory answer. The facts of\r\nmeteorology are too complex for easy or certain classification. Effects\r\nowning dependence on one cause often wear the livery of another; the\r\nmeaning of observed particulars may be inverted by situation; and yet it\r\nis only by the collection and collocation of particulars that we can\r\nhope to reach any general law. There is, however, a good deal of\r\nevidence to support the opinion--the grounds for which were primarily\r\nderived from the labours of Dr. Meldrum at Mauritius--that increased\r\nrainfall and atmospheric agitation attend spot-maxima; while Herschel's\r\nconjecture of a more copious emission of light and heat about the same\r\nepochs has recently obtained some countenance from Savélieff's measures\r\nshowing a gain in the strength of the sun's radiation _pari passu_ with\r\nincrease in the number of spots visible on his surface.[502]\r\n\r\nThe examination of what we may call the _texture_ of the sun's surface\r\nderived new interest from a remarkable announcement made by Mr. James\r\nNasmyth in 1862.[503] He had made (as he supposed) the discovery that\r\nthe entire luminous stratum of the sun is composed of a multitude of\r\nelongated shining objects on a darker background, shaped much like\r\nwillow-leaves, of vast size, crossing each other in all possible\r\ndirections, and possessed of unceasing relative motions. A lively\r\ncontroversy ensued. In England and abroad the most powerful telescopes\r\nwere directed to a scrutiny encompassed with varied difficulties. Mr.\r\nDawes was especially emphatic in declaring that Nasmyth's\r\n\"willow-leaves\" were nothing more than the \"nodules\" of Sir William\r\nHerschel seen under a misleading aspect of uniformity; and there is\r\nlittle doubt that he was right. It is, nevertheless, admitted that\r\nsomething of the kind may be seen in the penumbræ and \"bridges\" of\r\nspots, presenting an appearance compared by Dawes himself in 1852 to\r\nthat of a piece of coarse straw-thatching left untrimmed at the\r\nedges.[504]\r\n\r\nThe term \"granulated,\" suggested by Dawes in 1864,[505] best describes\r\nthe mottled aspect of the solar disc as shown by modern telescopes and\r\ncameras. The grains, or rather the \"floccules,\" with which it is thickly\r\nstrewn, have been resolved by Langley, under exceptionally favourable\r\nconditions, into \"granules\" not above 100 miles in diameter; and from\r\nthese relatively minute elements, composing, jointly, about one-fifth of\r\nthe visible photosphere,[506] he estimates that three-quarters of the\r\nentire light of the sun are derived.[507] Janssen agrees, so far as to\r\nsay that if the whole surface were as bright as its brightest parts, its\r\nluminous emission would be ten to twenty times greater than it actually\r\nis.[508]\r\n\r\nThe rapid changes in the forms of these solar cloud-summits are\r\nbeautifully shown in the marvellous photographs taken by Janssen at\r\nMeudon, with exposures reduced at times to 1/100000 of a second! By\r\ntheir means, also, the curious phenomenon known as the _réseau\r\nphotosphérique_ has been made evident.[509] This consists in the\r\ndiffusion over the entire disc of fleeting blurred patches, separated by\r\na reticulation of sharply-outlined and regularly-arranged granules. The\r\nimperfect definition in the smudged areas may be due to agitations in\r\nthe solar or terrestrial atmosphere, unless it be--as Dr. Schemer thinks\r\npossible[510]--merely a photographic effect. M. Janssen considers that\r\nthe photospheric cloudlets change their shape and character with the\r\nprogress of the sun-spot period;[511] but this is as yet uncertain.\r\n\r\nThe \"grains,\" or more brilliant parts of the photosphere, are now\r\ngenerally held to represent the upper termination of ascending and\r\ncondensing currents, while the darker interstices (Herschel's \"pores\")\r\nmark the positions of descending cooler ones. In the penumbræ of spots,\r\nthe glowing streams rushing up from the tremendous sub-solar furnace are\r\nbent sideways by the powerful indraught, so as to change their vertical\r\nfor a nearly horizontal motion, and are thus taken, as it were, in flank\r\nby the eye, instead of being seen end-on in mamelon-form. This gives a\r\nplausible explanation of the channelled structure of penumbræ which\r\nsuggested the comparison to a rude thatch. Accepting this theory as in\r\nthe main correct, we perceive that the very same circulatory process\r\nwhich, in its spasms of activity, gives rise to spots, produces in its\r\nregular course the singular \"marbled\" appearance, for the recording of\r\nwhich we are no longer at the mercy of the fugitive or delusive\r\nimpressions of the human retina. And precisely this circulatory process\r\nit is which gives to our great luminary its permance as a _sun_, or\r\nwarming and illuminating body.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 405: _Mem. R. A.

Each of these\r\nevents brought with it a fresh disclosure of a definite and unmistakable\r\ncharacter. We will now briefly review this orderly sequence of\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\nPhotography was first systematically applied to solve the problems\r\npresented by the eclipsed sun, July 18, 1860. It is true that a\r\ndaguerreotype,[512] taken by Berkowski with the Königsberg heliometer\r\nduring the eclipse of 1851, is still valuable as a record of the corona\r\nof that year; and some subsequent attempts were made to register partial\r\nphases of solar occultation, notably by Professor Bartlett at West Point\r\nin 1854;[513] but the ground remained practically unbroken until 1860.\r\n\r\nIn that year the track of totality crossed Spain, and thither,\r\naccordingly, Warren de la Rue transported his photo-heliograph, and\r\nFather Secchi his six-inch Cauchoix refractor. The question then\r\nprimarily at issue was that relating to the nature of the red\r\nprotuberances. Although, as already stated, the evidence collected in\r\n1851 gave a reasonable certainty of their connection with the sun,\r\nobjectors were not silenced; and when the side of incredulity was\r\nsupported by so considerable an authority as M. Faye, it was impossible\r\nto treat it with contempt. Two crucial tests were available. If it could\r\nbe shown that the fantastic shapes suspended above the edge of the dark\r\nmoon were seen under an identical aspect from two distant stations, that\r\nfact alone would annihilate the theory of optical illusion or \"mirage\";\r\nwhile the certainty that they were progressively concealed by the\r\nadvancing moon on one side, and uncovered on the other, would\r\neffectually detach them from dependence on our satellite, and establish\r\nthem as solar appendages.\r\n\r\nNow both these tests were eminently capable of being applied by\r\nphotography. But the difficulty arose that nothing was known as to the\r\nchemical power of the rosy prominence-light, while everything depended\r\non its right estimation. A shot had to be fired, as it were, in the\r\ndark. It was a matter of some surprise, and of no small congratulation,\r\nthat, in both cases, the shot took effect.\r\n\r\nDe la Rue occupied a station at Rivabellosa, in the Upper Ebro valley;\r\nSecchi set up his instrument at Desierto de las Palmas, about 250 miles\r\nto the south-east, overlooking the Mediterranean. From the totally\r\neclipsed sun, with its strange garland of flames, each observer derived\r\nseveral perfectly successful impressions, which were found, on\r\ncomparison, to agree in the most minute details. This at once settled\r\nthe fundamental question as to the substantial reality of these objects;\r\nwhile their solar character was demonstrated by the passage of the moon\r\n_in front_ of them, indisputably attested by pictures taken at\r\nsuccessive stages of the eclipse. That forms seeming to defy all laws of\r\nequilibrium were, nevertheless, not wholly evanescent, appeared from\r\ntheir identity at an interval of seven minutes, during which the lunar\r\nshadow was in transit from one station to the other; and the singular\r\nenergy of their actinic rays was shown by the record on the sensitive\r\nplates of some prominences invisible in the telescope. Moreover,\r\nphotographic evidence strongly confirmed the inference--previously drawn\r\nby Grant and others, and now with fuller assurance by Secchi--that an\r\nuninterrupted stratum of prominence-matter encompasses the sun on all\r\nsides, forming a reservoir from which gigantic jets issue, and into\r\nwhich they subside.\r\n\r\nThus, first-fruits of accurate knowledge regarding the solar\r\nsurroundings were gathered, while the value of the brief moments of\r\neclipse gained indefinite increase, by supplementing transient visual\r\nimpressions with the faithful and lasting records of the camera.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1868 the history of eclipse spectroscopy virtually began, as\r\nthat of eclipse photography in 1860; that is to say, the respective\r\nmethods then first gave definite results. On the 18th of August, 1868,\r\nthe Indian and Malayan peninsulas were traversed by a lunar shadow\r\nproducing total obscuration during five minutes and thirty-eight\r\nseconds. Two English and two French expeditions were despatched to the\r\ndistant regions favoured by an event so propitious to the advance of\r\nknowledge, chiefly to obtain the verdict of the prism as to the\r\ncomposition of prominences. Nor were they despatched in vain. An\r\nidentical discovery was made by nearly all the observers. At Jamkandi,\r\nin the Western Ghauts, where Lieutenant (now Colonel) Herschel was\r\nposted, unremitting bad weather threatened to baffle his eager\r\nexpectations; but during the lapse of the critical five and a half\r\nminutes the clouds broke, and across the driving wrack a \"long,\r\nfinger-like projection\" jutted out over the margin of the dark lunar\r\nglobe. In another moment the spectroscope was pointed towards it; three\r\nbright lines--red, orange, and blue--flashed out, and the problem was\r\nsolved.[514] The problem was solved in this general sense, that the\r\ncomposition out of glowing vapours of the objects infelicitously termed\r\n\"protuberances\" or \"prominences\" was no longer doubtful; although\r\nfurther inquiry was needed for the determination of the particular\r\nspecies to which those vapours belonged.\r\n\r\nSimilar, but more complete observations were made, with less atmospheric\r\nhindrance, by Tennant and Janssen at Guntoor, by Pogson at Masulipatam,\r\nand by Rayet at Wha-Tonne, on the coast of the Malay peninsula, the last\r\nobserver counting as many as nine bright lines.[515] Among them it was\r\nnot difficult to recognise the characteristic light of hydrogen; and it\r\nwas generally, though over-hastily, assumed that the orange ray matched\r\nthe luminous emissions of sodium. But fuller opportunities were at hand.\r\n\r\nThe eclipse of 1868 is chiefly memorable for having taught astronomers\r\nto do without eclipses, so far, at least, as one particular branch of\r\nsolar inquiry is concerned. Inspired by the beauty and brilliancy of the\r\nvariously tinted prominence-lines revealed to him by the spectroscope,\r\nJanssen exclaimed to those about him, \"Je verrai ces lignes-là en dehors\r\ndes éclipses!\" On the following morning he carried into execution the\r\nplan which formed itself in his brain while the phenomenon which\r\nsuggested it was still before his eyes. It rests upon an easily\r\nintelligible principle.\r\n\r\nThe glare of our own atmosphere alone hides the appendages of the sun\r\nfrom our daily view. To a spectator on an airless planet, the central\r\nglobe would appear attended by all its splendid retinue of crimson\r\nprominences, silvery corona, and far-spreading zodiacal light projected\r\non the star-spangled black background of an absolutely unilluminated\r\nsky. Now the spectroscope offers the means of indefinitely weakening\r\natmospheric glare by diffusing a constant amount of it over an area\r\nwidened _ad libitum_. But monochromatic or \"bright-line\" light is, by\r\nits nature, incapable of being so diffused. It can, of course, be\r\n_deviated_ by refraction to any extent desired; but it always remains\r\nequally concentrated, in whatever direction it may be thrown. Hence,\r\nwhen it is mixed up with continuous light--as in the case of the solar\r\nflames shining through our atmosphere--it derives a _relative_ gain in\r\nintensity from every addition to the dispersive power of the\r\nspectroscope with which the heterogeneous mass of beams is analysed.\r\nEmploy prisms enough, and eventually the undiminished rays of persistent\r\ncolour will stand out from the continually fading rainbow-tinted band,\r\nby which they were at first effectually veiled.\r\n\r\nThis Janssen saw by a flash of intuition while the eclipse was in\r\nprogress; and this he realised at 10 A.M. next morning, August 19,\r\n1868--the date of the beginning of spectroscopic work at the margin of\r\nthe unobscured sun. During the whole of that day and many subsequent\r\nones, he enjoyed, as he said, the advantage of a prolonged eclipse. The\r\nintense interest with which he surveyed the region suddenly laid bare to\r\nhis scrutiny was heightened by evidences of rapid and violent change. On\r\nthe 18th of August, during the eclipse, a vast spiral structure, _at\r\nleast_ 89,000 miles high, was perceived, planted in surprising splendour\r\non the rim of the interposed moon. If was formed as General Tennant\r\njudged from its appearance in his photographs, by the encounter of two\r\nmounting torrents of flame, and was distinguished as the \"Great Horn.\"\r\nNext day it was in ruins; hardly a trace remained to show where it had\r\nbeen.[516] Janssen's spectroscope furnished him besides with the\r\nstrongest confirmation of what had already been reported by the\r\ntelescope and the camera as to the continuous nature of the scarlet\r\n\"sierra\" lying at the base of the prominences. Everywhere at the sun's\r\nedge the same bright lines appeared.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the 19th of September that Janssen thought fit to send\r\nnews of his discovery to Europe. It seemed little likely to be\r\nanticipated; yet a few minutes before his despatch was handed to the\r\nSecretary of the Paris Academy of Sciences, a communication similar in\r\npurport had been received from Sir Norman Lockyer. There is no need to\r\ndiscuss the narrow and wearisome question of priority; each of the\r\ncompetitors deserves, and has obtained, full credit for his invention.\r\nWith noteworthy and confident prescience, Lockyer, in 1866, before\r\nanything was yet known regarding the constitution of the \"red flames,\"\r\nordered a strongly dispersive spectroscope for the express purpose of\r\nviewing, apart from eclipses, the bright-line spectrum which he expected\r\nthem to give. Various delays, however, supervened, and the instrument\r\nwas not in his hands until October 16, 1868. On the 20th he picked up\r\nthe vivid rays, of which the presence and (approximately) the positions\r\nhad in the interim become known. But there is little doubt that, even\r\nwithout that previous knowledge, they would have been found; and that\r\nthe eclipse of August 18 only accelerated a discovery already assured.\r\n\r\nSir William Huggins, meanwhile, had been tending towards the same goal\r\nduring two and a half years in his observatory at Tulse Hill. The\r\nprinciple of the spectroscopic visibility of prominence-lines at the\r\nedge of an uneclipsed sun was quite explicitly stated by him in\r\nFebruary, 1868,[517] and he devised various apparatus for bringing them\r\ninto actual view; but not until he knew where to look did he succeed in\r\nseeing them.\r\n\r\nAstronomers, thus liberated, by the acquisition of power to survey them\r\nat any time, from the necessity of studying prominences during eclipses,\r\nwere able to concentrate the whole of their attention on the corona. The\r\nfirst thing to be done was to ascertain the character of its spectrum.\r\nThis was seen in 1868 only as a faintly continuous one; for Rayet, who\r\nseems to have perceived its distinctive bright line far above the\r\nsummits of the flames, connected it, nevertheless, with those objects.\r\nOn the other hand, Lieutenant Campbell ascertained on the same occasion\r\nthe polarisation of the coronal light in planes passing through the\r\nsun's centre,[518] thereby showing that light to be, in whole or in\r\npart, reflected sunshine. But if reflected sunshine, it was objected,\r\nthe chief at least of the dark Fraunhofer lines should be visible in it,\r\nas they are visible in moonbeams, sky illumination, and all other\r\nsun-derived light. The objection was well founded, but was prematurely\r\nurged, as we shall see.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of August, 1869, a track of total eclipse crossed the\r\ncontinent of North America diagonally, entering at Behring's Straits,\r\nand issuing on the coast of North Carolina. It was beset with observers;\r\nbut the most effective work was done in Iowa. At Des Moines, Professor\r\nHarkness of the Naval Observatory, Washington, obtained from the corona\r\nan \"absolutely continuous spectrum,\" slightly less bright than that of\r\nthe full moon, but traversed by a single green ray.[519] The same green\r\nray was seen at Burlington and its position measured by Professor Young\r\nof Dartmouth College.[520] It appeared to coincide with that of a dark\r\nline of iron in the solar spectrum, numbered 1,474 on Kirchhoff's scale.\r\nBut in 1876 Young was able, by the use of greatly increased dispersion,\r\nto resolve the Fraunhofer line \"1474\" into a pair, the more refrangible\r\nmember of which he considered to be the reversal of the green coronal\r\nray.[521] Scarcely called in question for over twenty years, the\r\nidentification nevertheless broke down through the testimony of the\r\neclipse-photographs of 1898. Sir Norman Lockyer derived from them a\r\nposition for the line in question notably higher up in the spectrum than\r\nthat previously assigned to it. Instead of 5,317, its true wave-length\r\nproved to be 5,303 ten millionths of a millimetre;[522] nor does it make\r\nany show by absorption in dispersed sunlight. The originating substance,\r\ndesignated \"coronium,\" of which nothing is known to terrestrial\r\nchemistry, continues luminous[523] at least 300,000 miles above the\r\nsun's surface, and is hence presumably much lighter even than hydrogen.\r\n\r\nA further trophy was carried off by American skill[524] sixteen months\r\nafter the determination due to it of the distinctive spectrum of the\r\ncorona. The eclipse of December 22, 1870, though lasting only two\r\nminutes and ten seconds, drew observers from the New, as well as from\r\nthe Old World to the shores of the Mediterranean. Janssen issued from\r\nbeleaguered Paris in a balloon, carrying with him the _vital parts_ of a\r\nreflector specially constructed to collect evidence about the corona.\r\nBut he reached Oran only to find himself shut behind a cloud-curtain\r\nmore impervious than the Prussian lines. Everywhere the sky was more or\r\nless overcast. Lockyer's journey from England to Sicily, and shipwreck\r\nin the _Psyche_, were recompensed with a glimpse of the solar aureola\r\nduring _one second and a half_! Three parties stationed at various\r\nheights on Mount Etna saw absolutely nothing. Nevertheless important\r\ninformation was snatched in despite of the elements.\r\n\r\nThe prominent event was Young's discovery of the \"reversing layer.\" As\r\nthe surviving solar crescent narrowed before the encroaching moon, \"the\r\ndark lines of the spectrum,\" he tells us, \"and the spectrum itself,\r\ngradually faded away, until all at once, as suddenly as a bursting\r\nrocket shoots out its stars, the whole field of view was filled with\r\nbright lines more numerous than one could count. The phenomenon was so\r\nsudden, so unexpected, and so wonderfully beautiful, as to force an\r\ninvoluntary exclamation.\"[525] Its duration was about two seconds, and\r\nthe impression produced was that of a complete reversal of the\r\nFraunhofer spectrum--that is, the substitution of a bright for every\r\ndark line.\r\n\r\nNow something of the kind was theoretically necessary to account for the\r\ndusky rays in sunlight which have taught us so much, and have yet much\r\nmore to teach us; so that, although surprising from its transitory\r\nsplendour, the appearance could not strictly be called \"unexpected.\"\r\nMoreover, its premonitory symptom in the fading out of these rays had\r\nbeen actually described by Secchi in 1868,[526] and looked for by Young\r\nas the moon covered the sun in August 1869. But with the slit of his\r\nspectroscope placed _normally_ to the sun's limb, the bright lines gave\r\na flash too thin to catch the eye. In 1870 the position of the slit was\r\n_tangential_--it ran along the shallow bed of incandescent vapours,\r\ninstead of cutting across it: hence his success.\r\n\r\nThe same observation was made at Xerez de la Frontera by Mr. Pye, a\r\nmember of Young's party; and, although an exceedingly delicate one, has\r\nsince frequently been repeated. The whole Fraunhofer series appeared\r\nbright (omitting other instances) to Maclear, Herschel, and Fyers in\r\n1871, at the beginning or end of totality; to Pogson, at the break-up of\r\nan annual eclipse, June 6, 1872; to Stone at Klipfontein, April 16,\r\n1874, when he saw \"the field full of bright lines.\"[527] But between the\r\npicture presented by the \"véritable pluie de lignes brilliantes,\"[528]\r\nwhich descended into M. Trépied's spectroscope for three seconds after\r\nthe disappearance of the sun, May 17, 1882, and the familiar one of the\r\ndark-line solar spectrum, certain differences were perceiving, showing\r\ntheir relation to be not simply that of a positive to a negative\r\nimpression.\r\n\r\nA \"reversing layer,\" or stratum of mixed vapours, glowing, but at a\r\nlower temperature than that of the actual solar surface, was an integral\r\npart of Kirchhoff's theory of the production of the Fraunhofer lines.\r\nHere it was assumed that the missing rays were stopped, and here also it\r\nwas assumed that the missing rays would be seen bright, could they be\r\nisolated from the overpowering splendour of their background. This\r\nisolation is effected by eclipses, with the result--beautifully\r\nconfirmatory of theory--of _reversing_, or turning from dark to bright,\r\nthe Fraunhofer spectrum. The completeness and precision of the reversal,\r\nhowever, could not be visually attested; and a quarter of a century\r\nelapsed before a successful \"snap-shot\" provided photographic evidence\r\non the subject. It was taken at Novaya Zemlya by Mr. Shackleton, a\r\nmember of the late Sir George Baden-Powell's expedition to observe the\r\neclipse of August 9, 1896;[529] and similar records in abundance were\r\nsecured during the Indian eclipse of January 22, 1898,[530] and the\r\nSpanish-American eclipse of May 28, 1900.[531] The result of their\r\nleisurely examination has been to verify the existence of a\r\n\"reversing-layer,\" in the literal sense of the term. It is true that no\r\nsingle \"flash\" photograph is an inverted transcript of the Fraunhofer\r\nspectrum. The lines are, indeed, in each case--speaking broadly--the\r\nsame; but their relative intensities are widely different. Yet this need\r\noccasion no surprise when we remember that the Fraunhofer spectrum\r\nintegrates the absorption of multitudinous strata, various in density\r\nand composition, while only the upper section of the formation comes\r\nwithin view of the sensitive plates exposed at totalities, the low-lying\r\nvaporous beds being necessarily covered by the moon. The total depth of\r\nthis glowing envelope may be estimated at 500 to 600 miles, and its\r\nnormal state seems to be one of profound tranquillity, judging from the\r\nimperturbable aspect of the array of dark lines due to its sifting\r\naction upon light.\r\n\r\nThe last of the five eclipses which we have grouped together for\r\nseparate consideration was visible in Southern India and Australia,\r\nDecember 12, 1871. Some splendid photographs were secured by the English\r\nparties on the Malabar coast, showing, for the first time, the\r\nremarkable branching forms of the coronal emanations; but the most\r\nconspicuous result was Janssen's detection of some of the dark\r\nFraunhofer lines, long vainly sought in the continuous spectrum of the\r\ncorona. Chief among these was the D-line of sodium, the original index,\r\nit might be said, to solar chemistry. No proof could be afforded more\r\ndecisive that this faint _echoing back_ of the distinctive notes of the\r\nFraunhofer spectrum, that the polariscope had spoken the truth in\r\nasserting a large part of the coronal radiance to be reflected sunlight.\r\nBut it is usually so drenched in original luminosity, that its special\r\nfeatures are almost obliterated. Janssen's success in seizing them was\r\ndue in part to the extreme purity of the air at Sholoor, in the\r\nNeilgherries, where he was stationed; in part to the use of an\r\ninstrument adapted by its large aperture and short focus to give an\r\nimage of the utmost brilliancy. His observation, repeated during the\r\nCaroline Island eclipse of 1883, was photographically verified ten years\r\nlater by M. de la Baume Pluvinel in Senegal.[532]\r\n\r\nAn instrument of great value for particular purposes was introduced into\r\neclipse-work in 1871. The \"slitless spectroscope\" consists simply of a\r\nprism placed outside the object-glass of a telescope or the lens of a\r\ncamera, whereby the radiance encompassing the eclipsed sun is separated\r\ninto as many differently tinted rings as it contains different kinds of\r\nlight. These tinted rings were simultaneously viewed by Respighi at\r\nPoodacottah, and by Lockyer at Baikul. Their photographic registration\r\nby the latter in 1875 initiated the transformation of the slitless\r\nspectroscope into the prismatic camera.[533] Meanwhile, the use of an\r\nordinary spectroscope by Herschel and Tennant at Dodabetta showed the\r\ngreen ray of coronium to be just as bright in a rift as in the adjacent\r\nstreamer. The visible structure of the corona was thus seen to be\r\nindependent of the distribution of the gases which enter into its\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\nBy means, then, of the five great eclipses of 1860-71 it was\r\nascertained: first, that the prominences, and at least the lower part of\r\nthe corona, are genuine solar appurtenances; secondly, that the\r\nprominences are composed of hydrogen and other gases in a state of\r\nincandescence, and rise, as irregular outliers, from a continuous\r\nenvelope of the same materials, some thousands of miles in thickness;\r\nthirdly, that the corona is of a highly complex constitution, being made\r\nup in part of glowing vapours, in part of matter capable of reflecting\r\nsunlight. We may now proceed to consider the results of subsequent\r\neclipses.\r\n\r\nThese have raised, and have helped to solve, some very curious\r\nquestions. Indeed, every carefully watched total eclipse of the sun\r\nstimulates as well as appeases curiosity, and leaves a legacy of\r\noutstanding doubt, continually, as time and inquiry go on, removed, but\r\ncontinually replaced. It cannot be denied that the corona is a\r\nperplexing phenomenon, and that it does not become less perplexing as we\r\nknow more about it. It presented itself under quite a new and strange\r\naspect on the occasion of the eclipse which visited the Western States\r\nof North America, July 29, 1878. The conditions of observation were\r\npeculiarly favourable. The weather was superb; above the Rocky Mountains\r\nthe sky was of such purity as to permit the detection of Jupiter's\r\nsatellites with the naked eye on several successive nights. The\r\nopportunity for advancing knowledge was made the most of. Nearly a\r\nhundred astronomers, including several Englishmen, occupied twelve\r\nseparate posts, and prepared for an attack in force.\r\n\r\nThe question had often suggested itself, and was a natural one to ask,\r\nwhether the corona sympathises with the general condition of the sun?\r\nwhether, either in shape or brilliancy, it varies with the progress of\r\nthe sun-spot period? A more propitious moment for getting this question\r\nanswered could hardly have been chosen than that at which the eclipse\r\noccurred. Solar disturbance was just then at its lowest ebb. The\r\ndevelopment of spots for the month of July, 1878, was represented on\r\nWolf's system of \"relative numbers\" by the fraction 0·1, as against\r\n135·4 for December, 1870, an epoch of maximum activity. The\r\n\"chromosphere\"[534] was, for the most part, shallow and quiescent; its\r\ndepth, above the spot zones, had sunk from about 6,000 to 2,000\r\nmiles;[535] prominences were few and faint. Obviously, if a type of\r\ncorona corresponding to a minimum of sun-spots existed, it should be\r\nseen then or never. It _was_ seen; but while, in some respects, it\r\nagreed with anticipation, in others it completely set it at naught.\r\n\r\nThe corona of 1878, as compared with those of 1869, 1870, and 1871, was\r\ngenerally admitted to be shrunken in its main outlines and much reduced\r\nin brilliancy. Lockyer pronounced it ten times fainter than in 1871;\r\nHarkness estimated its light at less than one-seventh that derived from\r\nthe mist-blotted aureola of 1870.[536] In shape, too, it was markedly\r\ndifferent. When sun-spots are numerous, the corona appears to be most\r\nfully developed above the spot-zones, thus offering to our eyes a rudely\r\nquadrilateral contour. The four great luminous sheaves forming the\r\ncorners of the square are made up of rays curving together from each\r\nside into \"synclinal\" or ogival groups, each of which may be compared to\r\nthe petal of a flower. To Janssen, in 1871, the eclipsing moon seemed\r\nlike the dark heart of a gigantic dahlia, painted in light on the sky;\r\nand the similitude to the ornament on a compass-card, used by Airy in\r\n1851, well conveys the decorative effect of the beamy, radiated kind of\r\naureola, never, it would appear, absent when solar activity is at a\r\ntolerably high pitch. In his splendid volume on eclipses,[537] with\r\nwhich the systematic study of coronal structure may be said to have\r\nbegun, Mr. Ranyard first generalised the synclinal peculiarity by a\r\ncomparison of records; but the symmetry of the arrangement, though\r\nfrequently striking, is liable to be confused by secondary formations.\r\nHe further pointed out, with the help of careful drawings from the\r\nphotographs of 1871 made by Mr. Wesley, the curved and branching shapes\r\nassumed by the component filaments of massive bundles of rays. Nothing\r\nof all this, however, was visible in 1878. Instead, there was seen, as\r\nthe groundwork of the corona, a ring of pearly light, nebulous to the\r\neye, but shown by telescopes and in photographs to have a fibrous\r\ntexture, as if made up of tufts of fine hairs. North and south, a series\r\nof short, vivid, electrical-looking flame-brushes diverged with\r\nconspicuous regularity from each of the solar poles. Their direction was\r\nnot towards the centre of the sun, but towards each summit of his axis,\r\nso that the farther rays on either side started almost tangentially to\r\nthe surface.\r\n\r\nBut the leading, and a truly amazing, characteristic of the phenomenon\r\nwas formed by two vast, faintly-luminous _wings_ of light, expanded on\r\neither side of the sun in the direction of the ecliptic. These were\r\nmissed by very few careful onlookers; but the extent assigned to them\r\nvaried with skill in, and facilities for seeing. By far the most\r\nstriking observations were made by Newcomb at Separation (Wyoming), by\r\nCleveland Abbe from the shoulder of Pike's Peak, and by Langley at its\r\nsummit, an elevation of 14,100 feet above the sea. Never before had an\r\neclipse been viewed from anything approaching that altitude, or under so\r\ntranslucent a sky. A proof of the great reduction in atmospheric glare\r\nwas afforded by the perceptibility of the corona four minutes after\r\ntotality was over. For the 165 seconds of its duration, the remarkable\r\nstreamers above alluded to continued \"persistently visible,\" stretching\r\naway right and left of the sun to a distance of at least ten million\r\nmiles! One branch was traced over an apparent extent of fully twelve\r\nlunar diameters, without sign of a definite termination having been\r\nreached; and there were no grounds for supposing the other more\r\nrestricted.\r\n\r\nThe resemblance to the zodiacal light was striking; and a community of\r\norigin between that enigmatical member of our system and the corona was\r\nirresistibly suggested. We should, indeed, expect to see, under such\r\nexceptionally favourable atmospheric conditions as Professor Langley\r\nenjoyed on Pike's Peak, the _roots_ of the zodiacal light presenting\r\nnear the sun just such an appearance as he witnessed; but we can imagine\r\nno reason why their visibility should be associated with a low state of\r\nsolar activity. Nevertheless this seems to be the case with the\r\nstreamers which astonished astronomers in 1878. For in August, 1867,\r\nwhen similar equatorial emanations, accompanied by similar symptoms of\r\npolar excitement, were described and depicted by Grosch[538] of the\r\nSantiago Observatory, sun-spots were at a minimum; while the corona of\r\n1715, which appears from the record of it by Roger Cotes[539] to have\r\nbeen of the same type, preceded by three years the ensuing maximum. The\r\neclipsed sun was seen by him at Cambridge, May 2, 1715, encompassed with\r\na ring of light about one-sixth of the moon's diameter in breadth, upon\r\nwhich was superposed a luminous cross formed of long bright branches\r\nlying very nearly in the plane of the ecliptic, and shorter polar arms\r\nso faint as to be only intermittently visible. The resemblance between\r\nhis sketch and Cleveland Abbe's drawing of the corona of 1878 is\r\nextremely striking. It should, nevertheless, be noted that some\r\nconspicuous spots were visible on the sun's disc at the time of Cotes's\r\neclipse, and that the preceding minimum (according to Wolf) occurred in\r\n1712. Thus, the coincidence of epochs is imperfect.\r\n\r\nProfessor Cleveland Abbe was fully persuaded that the long rays\r\ncarefully observed by him from Pike's Peak were nothing else than\r\nstreams of meteorites rushing towards or from perihelion; and it is\r\nquite certain that the solar neighbourhood must be crowded with such\r\nbodies. But the peculiar structure at the base of the streamers\r\ndisplayed in the photographs, the curved rays meeting in pointed arches\r\nlike Gothic windows, the visible upspringing tendency, the filamentous\r\ntexture,[540] speak unmistakably of the action of forces proceeding\r\n_from_ the sun, not of extraneous matter circling round him.\r\n\r\nA further proof of sympathetic change in the corona is afforded by the\r\nanalysis of its light. In 1878 the bright line so conspicuous in the\r\ncoronal spectrum in 1870 and 1871 had faded to the very limit of\r\nvisibility. Several skilled observers failed to see it at all; but Young\r\nand Eastman succeeded in tracing the green \"coronium\" ray all round the\r\nsun, to a height estimated at 340,000 miles. The substance emitting it\r\nwas thus present, though in a low state of incandescence. The continuous\r\nspectrum was relatively strong; faint traces of the Fraunhofer lines\r\nattested for it an origin, in part by reflection; and polarisation was\r\nundoubted, increasing towards the limb, whereas in 1870 it reached a\r\nmaximum at a considerable distance from it. Experiments with Edison's\r\ntasimeter seemed to show that the corona radiates a sensible amount of\r\nheat.\r\n\r\nThe next promising eclipse occurred May 17, 1882. The concourse of\r\nastronomers which has become usual on such occasions assembled this time\r\nat Sohag, in Upper Egypt. Rarely have seventy-four seconds been turned\r\nto such account. To each observer a special task was assigned, and the\r\nadvantages of a strict division of labour were visible in the variety\r\nand amount of the information gained.\r\n\r\nThe year 1882 was one of numerous sun-spots. On the eve of the eclipse\r\ntwenty-three separate maculæ were counted. If there were any truth in\r\nthe theory which connected coronal forms with fluctuations in solar\r\nactivity, it might be anticipated that the vast equatorial expansions\r\nand polar \"brushes\" of 1878 would be found replaced by the star-like\r\nstructure of 1871. This expectation was literally fulfilled. No lateral\r\nstreamers were to be seen. The universal failure to perceive them, after\r\nexpress search in a sky of the most transparent purity, justifies the\r\nemphatic assertion that _they were not there_. Instead, the type of\r\ncorona observed in India eleven years earlier, was reproduced with its\r\nshining aigrettes, complex texture and brilliant radiated aspect.\r\n\r\nConcordant testimony was given by the spectroscope. The reflected light\r\nderived from the corona was weaker than in 1878, while its original\r\nemissions were proportionately intensified. Nevertheless, most of the\r\nbright lines recorded as coronal[541] were really due, there can be no\r\ndoubt, to diffused chromospheric light. On this occasion, the first\r\nsuccessful attempt was made to photograph the coronal spectrum procured\r\nin the ordinary way with a slit and prisms, while the prismatic camera\r\nwas also profitably employed. It served to bring out at least one\r\nimportant fact--that of the uncommon strength in chromospheric regions\r\nof the twin violet beams of calcium, designated \"H\" and \"K\"; and\r\nprominence-photography signalised its improvement by the registration,\r\nin the spectrum of one such object, of twenty-nine rays, including many\r\nof the ultra-violet hydrogen series discovered by Sir William Huggins in\r\nthe emission of white stars.[542]\r\n\r\nDr. Schuster's photographs of the corona itself were the most extensive,\r\nas well as the most detailed, of any yet secured. One rift imprinted\r\nitself on the plates to a distance of nearly a diameter and a half from\r\nthe limb; and the transparency of the streamers was shown by the\r\ndelineation through them of the delicate tracery beyond. The singular\r\nand picturesque feature was added of a bright comet, self-depicted in\r\nall the exquisite grace of swift movement betrayed by the fine curve of\r\nits tail, hurrying away from one of its rare visits to our sun, and\r\nrendered momentarily visible by the withdrawal of the splendour in which\r\nit had been, and was again quickly veiled.\r\n\r\nFrom a careful study of these valuable records Sir William Huggins\r\nderived the idea of a possible mode of photographing the corona _without\r\nan eclipse_.[543] As already stated, its ordinary invisibility is\r\nentirely due to the \"glare\" or reflected light diffused through our\r\natmosphere. But Huggins found, on examining Schuster's negatives, that a\r\nlarge proportion of the light in the coronal spectrum, both continuous\r\nand interrupted, is collected in the violet region between the\r\nFraunhofer lines G and H. There, then, he hoped that, all other rays\r\nbeing excluded, it might prove strong enough to vanquish inimical glare,\r\nand stamp on prepared plates, through _local_ superiority in\r\nilluminative power, the forms of the appendage by which it is emitted.\r\n\r\nHis experiments were begun towards the end of May, 1882, and by\r\nSeptember 28 he had obtained a fair earnest of success. The exclusion of\r\nall other qualities of light save that with which he desired to operate,\r\nwas accomplished by using chloride of silver as his sensitive material,\r\nthat substance being chemically inert to all other but those precise\r\nrays in which the corona has the advantage.[544] Plates thus sensitised\r\nreceived impressions which it was hardly possible to regard as spurious.\r\n\"Not only the general features,\" Captain Abney affirmed,[545] \"are the\r\nsame, but details, such as rifts and streamers, have the same position\r\nand form.\" It was found, moreover, that the corona photographed during\r\nthe total eclipse of May 6, 1883, was intermediate in shape between the\r\ncoronas photographed by Sir William Huggins before and after that event,\r\neach picture taking its proper place in a series of progressive\r\nmodifications highly interesting in themselves, and full of promise for\r\nthe value of the method employed to record them.[546] But experiments on\r\nthe subject were singularly interrupted. The volcanic explosion in the\r\nStraits of Sunda in August, 1883, brought to astronomers a peculiarly\r\nunwelcome addition to their difficulties. The magnificent sunglows due\r\nto the diffractive effects on light of the vapours and fine dust flung\r\nin vast volumes into the air, and rapidly diffused all round the globe,\r\nbetokened an atmospheric condition of all others the most prejudicial to\r\ndelicate researches in the solar vicinity. The filmy coronal forms,\r\naccordingly, which had been hopefully traced on the Tulse Hill plates\r\nceased to appear there; nor were any substantially better results\r\nobtained by Mr. C. Ray Woods, in the purer air either of the Riffel or\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope, during the three ensuing years. Moreover,\r\nattempts to obtain coronal photographs during the partial phases of the\r\neclipse of August 29, 1886, completely failed. No part of the lunar\r\nglobe became visible in relief against circumfluous solar radiance on\r\nany of the plates exposed at Grenada; and what vestiges of \"structure\"\r\nthere were, came out almost better _upon_ the moon than _beside_ her,\r\nthus stamping themselves at once as of atmospheric origin.\r\n\r\nThat the effect sought is a perfectly possible one is proved by the\r\ndistinct appearance of the moon projected on the corona, in photographs\r\nof the partially eclipsed sun in 1858, 1889, and 1890, and very notably\r\nin 1898 and 1900.[547]\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1893, Professor Hale[548] attacked the problem of\r\ncoronal daylight photography, employing the \"double-slit\" method so\r\neminently serviceable for the delineation of prominences.[549] But\r\nneither at Kenwood nor at the summit of Pike's Peak, whither, in the\r\ncourse of the summer, he removed his apparatus, was any action of the\r\ndesired kind secured. Similar ill success attended his and Professor\r\nRiccò's employment, on Mount Etna in July, 1894, of a specially designed\r\ncoronagraph. Yet discouragement did not induce despair. The end in view\r\nis indeed too important to be readily abandoned; but it can be reached\r\nonly when a more particular acquaintance with the nature of coronal\r\nlight than we now possess indicates the appropriate device for giving it\r\na preferential advantage in self-portraiture. Moreover, the\r\neffectiveness of this device may not improbably be enhanced, through\r\nchanges in the coronal spectrum at epochs of sun-spot maximum.\r\n\r\nThe prosperous result of the Sohag observations stimulated the desire to\r\nrepeat them on the first favourable opportunity. This offered itself one\r\nyear later, May 6, 1883, yet not without the drawbacks incident to\r\nterrestrial conditions. The eclipse promised was of rare length, giving\r\nno less than five minutes and twenty-three seconds of total obscurity,\r\nbut its path was almost exclusively a \"water-track.\" It touched land\r\nonly on the outskirts of the Marquesas group in the Southern Pacific,\r\nand presented, as the one available foothold for observers, a coral reef\r\nnamed Caroline Island, seven and a half miles long by one and a half\r\nwide, unknown previously to 1874, and visited only for the sake of its\r\nstores of guano. Seldom has a more striking proof been given of the\r\nvividness of human curiosity as to the condition of the worlds outside\r\nour own, than in the assemblage of a group of distinguished men from the\r\nchief centres of civilisation, on a barren ridge, isolated in a vast and\r\ntempestuous ocean, at a distance, in many cases, of 11,000 miles and\r\nupwards from the ordinary scene of their labours. And all these\r\nsacrifices--the cost and care of preparation, the transport and\r\nreadjustment of delicate instruments, the contrivance of new and more\r\nsubtle means of investigating phenomena--on the precarious chance of a\r\nclear sky during one particular five minutes! The event, though\r\nfortunate, emphasised the hazard of the venture. The observation of the\r\neclipse was made possible only by the happy accident of a serene\r\ninterval between two storms.\r\n\r\nThe American expedition was led by Professor Edward S. Holden, and to it\r\nwere courteously permitted to be attached Messrs. Lawrance and Woods,\r\nphotographers, sent out by the Royal Society of London. M. Janssen was\r\nchief of the French Academy mission; he was accompanied from Meudon by\r\nTrouvelot, and joined from Vienna by Palisa, and from Rome by Tacchini.\r\nA large share of the work done was directed to assuring or negativing\r\nprevious results. The circumstances of an eclipse favour illusion. A\r\nsingle observation by a single observer, made under unfamiliar\r\nconditions, and at a moment of peculiar excitement, can scarcely be\r\nregarded as offering more than a suggestion for future inquiry. But\r\nincredulity may be carried too far. Janssen, for instance, felt\r\ncompelled, by the survival of unwise doubts, to devote some of the\r\nprecious minutes of obscurity at Caroline Island to confirming what, in\r\nhis own persuasion, needed no confirmation--that is, the presence of\r\nreflected Fraunhofer lines in the spectrum of the corona. Trouvelot and\r\nPalisa, on the other hand, instituted an exhaustive, but fruitless\r\nsearch for the spurious \"intramercurian\" planets announced by Swift and\r\nWatson in 1878.\r\n\r\nNew information, however, was not deficient. The corona proved identical\r\nin type with that of 1882,[550] agreeably to what was expected at an\r\nepoch of protracted solar activity. The characteristic aigrettes were of\r\neven greater brilliancy than in the preceding year, and the chemical\r\neffects of the coronal light proved unusually intense. Janssen's\r\nphotographs, owing to the considerable apertures (six and eight inches)\r\nof his object-glasses, and the long exposures permitted by the duration\r\nof totality, were singularly perfect; they gave a greater extension to\r\nthe coronal than could be traced with the telescope,[551] and showed its\r\nforms as absolutely fixed and of remarkable complexity.\r\n\r\nThe English pictures, taken with exposures up to sixty seconds, were\r\nlikewise of great value. They exhibited details of structure from the\r\nlimb to the tips of the streamers, which terminated definitely, and as\r\nit seemed actually, where the impressions on the plates ceased. The\r\ncoronal spectrum was also successfully photographed, and although the\r\nreversing layer in its entirety evaded record, a print was caught of\r\nsome of its more prominent rays just before and after totality. The use\r\nof the prismatic camera was baffled by the anomalous scarcity of\r\nprominences.\r\n\r\nUsing an ingenious apparatus for viewing simultaneously the spectrum\r\nfrom both sides of the sun, Professor Hastings noticed at Caroline\r\nIsland alternations, with the advance of the moon, in the respective\r\nheights above the right and left solar limbs of the coronal green line,\r\nwhich were thought to imply that the corona, with its rifts and sheaves\r\nand \"tangled hanks\" of rays, is, after all, merely an illusive\r\nappearance produced by the diffraction of sunlight at the moon's\r\nedge.[552] But the observation was assuredly misleading or\r\nmisinterpreted. Atmospheric _diffusion_ may indeed, under favouring\r\ncircumstances, be effective in deceptively enlarging solar appendages;\r\nbut always to a very limited extent.\r\n\r\nThe controversy is an old one as to the part played by our air in\r\nproducing the radiance visible round the eclipsed sun. In its original\r\nform, it is true, it came to an end when Professor Harkness, in\r\n1869,[553] pointed out that the shadow of the moon falls equally over\r\nthe air and on the earth, and that if the sun had no luminous\r\nappendages, a circular space of almost absolute darkness would\r\nconsequently surround the apparent places of the superposed sun and\r\nmoon. Mr. Proctor,[554] with his usual ability, impressed this\r\nmathematically certain truth upon public attention; and Sir John\r\nHerschel calculated that the diameter of the \"negative halo\" thus\r\nproduced would be, in general, no less than 23°.\r\n\r\nBut about the same time a noteworthy circumstance relating to the state\r\nof things in the solar vicinity was brought into view. On February 11,\r\n1869, Messrs. Frankland and Lockyer communicated to the Royal Society a\r\nseries of experiments on gaseous spectra under varying conditions of\r\nheat and density, leading them to the conclusion that the higher solar\r\nprominences exist in a medium of excessive tenuity, and that even at the\r\nbase of the chromosphere the pressure is far below that at the earth's\r\nsurface.[555] This inference was fully borne out by the researches of\r\nWüllner; and Janssen expressed the opinion that the chromospheric gases\r\nare rarefied almost to the degree of an air-pump vacuum.[556] Hence was\r\nderived a general and fully justified conviction that there could be\r\noutside, and incumbent upon the chromosphere, no such vast atmosphere as\r\nthe corona appeared to represent. Upon the strength of which conviction\r\nthe \"glare\" theory entered, chiefly under the auspices of Sir Norman\r\nLockyer, upon the second stage of its existence.\r\n\r\nThe genuineness of the \"inner corona\" to the height of 5' or 6' from the\r\nlimb was admitted; but it was supposed that by the detailed reflection\r\nof its light in our air the far more extensive \"outer corona\" was\r\noptically created, the irregularities of the moon's edge being called in\r\nto account for the rays and rifts by which its structure was varied.\r\nThis view received some countenance from Admiral Maclear's observation,\r\nduring the eclipse of 1870, of bright lines \"everywhere\"--even at the\r\ncentre of the lunar disc. Here, indeed, was an undoubted case of\r\natmospheric diffusion; but here, also, was a safe index to the extent of\r\nits occurrence. Light scatters equally in all directions; so that when\r\nthe moon's face at the time of an eclipse shows (as is the common case)\r\na blank in the spectroscope, it is quite certain that the corona is not\r\nnoticeably enlarged by atmospheric causes. A sky drifted over with thin\r\ncirrus clouds and air changed with aqueous vapour amply accounted for\r\nthe abnormal amount of scattering in 1870.\r\n\r\nBut even in 1870 positive evidence was obtained of the substantial\r\nreality of the radiated outer corona, in the appearance on the\r\nphotographic plates exposed by Willard in Spain and by Brothers in\r\nSicily of identical dark rifts. The truth is, that far from being\r\ndeveloped by misty air, it is peculiarly liable to be effaced by it. The\r\npurer the sky, the more extensive, brilliant, and intricate in the\r\ndetails of its structure the corona appears. Take as an example General\r\nMyer's description of the eclipse of 1869, as seen from the summit of\r\nWhite Top Mountain, Virginia, at an elevation above the sea of 5,523\r\nfeet, in an atmosphere of peculiar clearness.\r\n\r\n\"To the unaided eye,\" he wrote,[557] \"the eclipse presented, during the\r\ntotal obscuration, a vision magnificent beyond description. As a centre\r\nstood the full and intensely black disc of the moon, surrounded by the\r\naureola of a soft bright light, through which shot out, as if from the\r\ncircumference of the moon, straight, massive, silvery rays, seeming\r\ndistinct and separate from each other, to a distance of two or three\r\ndiameters of the solar disc; the whole spectacle showing as on a\r\nbackground of diffused rose-coloured light.\"\r\n\r\nOn the same day, at Des Moines, Newcomb could perceive, through somewhat\r\nhazy air, no long rays, and the four-pointed outline of the corona\r\nreached at its farthest only a _single semidiameter_ of the moon from\r\nthe limb. The plain fact, that our atmosphere acts rather as a veil to\r\nhide the coronal radiance than as the medium through which it is\r\nvisually formed, emerges from further innumerable records.\r\n\r\nNo observations of importance were made during the eclipse of September\r\n9, 1885. The path of total obscurity touched land only on the shores of\r\nNew Zealand, and two minutes was the outside limit of available time.\r\nHence local observers had the phenomenon to themselves; nor were they\r\neven favoured by the weather in their efforts to make the most of it.\r\nOne striking appearance was, however, disclosed. It was that of two\r\n\"white\" prominences of unusual brilliancy, shining like a pair of\r\nelectric lamps hung one at each end of a solar diameter, right above the\r\nplaces of two large spots.[558] This coincidence of diametrically\r\nopposite disturbances is of too frequent occurrence to be accidental. M.\r\nTrouvelot observed at Meudon, June 26, 1885, two active and evanescent\r\nprominences thus situated, each rising to the enormous height of 300,000\r\nmiles; and on August 16, one scarcely less remarkable, balanced by an\r\nantipodal spot-group.[559] It towered upward, as if by a process of\r\n_unrolling_, to a quarter of a million of miles; after which, in two\r\nminutes, the light died out of it; it had become completely extinct. The\r\ndevelopment, again from the ends of a diameter, of a pair of similar\r\nobjects was watched, September 19 and 20, 1893, by Father Fényi,\r\nDirector of the Kalocsa Observatory; and the phenomenon has been too\r\noften repeated to be accidental.\r\n\r\nThe eclipse of August 29, 1886, was total during about four minutes over\r\ntropical Atlantic regions; and an English expedition, led by Sir Norman\r\nLockyer, was accordingly despatched to Grenada in the West Indies, for\r\nthe purpose of using the opportunity it offered. But the rainy season\r\nwas just then at its height: clouds and squalls were the order of the\r\nday; and the elaborately planned programme of observation could only in\r\npart be carried through. Some good work, none the less, was done.\r\nProfessor Tacchini, who had been invited to accompany the party,\r\nascertained besides some significant facts about prominences. From a\r\ncomparison of their forms and sizes during and after the eclipse, it\r\nappeared that only the growing vaporous cores of these objects are shown\r\nby the spectroscope under ordinary circumstances; their upper sections,\r\ngiving a faint continuous spectrum, and composed of presumably cooler\r\nmaterials, can only be seen when the veil of scattered light usually\r\ndrawn over them is removed by an eclipse. Thus all modestly tall\r\nprominences have silvery summits; but all do not appear to possess the\r\n\"red heart of flame,\" by which alone they can be rendered perceptible to\r\ndaylight observation. Some prove to be ordinarily invisible, because\r\nsilvery throughout--\"sheeted ghosts,\" as it were, met only in the dark.\r\n\r\nSpecimens of the class had been noted as far back as 1842, but Tacchini\r\nfirst drew particular attention to them. The one observed by him in 1886\r\nrose in a branching form to a height of 150,000 miles, and gave a\r\nbrilliantly continuous spectrum, with bright lines at H and K, but no\r\nhydrogen-lines.[560] Hence the total invisibility of the object before\r\nand after the eclipse. During the eclipse, it was seen framed, as it\r\nwere, in a pointed arch of coronal light, the symmetrical arrangement of\r\nwhich with regard to it was obviously significant. Both its unspringing\r\nshape, and the violet rays of calcium strongly emitted by it,\r\ncontradicted the supposition that \"white prominences\" represent a\r\ndownrush of refrigerated materials.\r\n\r\nThe corona of 1886, as photographed by Dr. Schuster and Mr. Maunder,\r\nshowed neither the petals and plumes of 1871, nor the streamers of 1878.\r\nIt might be called of a transition type.[561] Wide polar rifts were\r\nfilled in with tufted radiations, and bounded on either side by\r\nirregularly disposed, compound luminous masses. In the south-western\r\nquadrant, a triangular ray, conspicuous to the naked eye, represented,\r\nMr. W. H. Pickering thought, the projection of a huge, hollow cone.[562]\r\nBranched and recurving jets were curiously associated with it. The\r\nintrinsic photographic brightness of the corona proved, from Pickering's\r\nmeasures, to be about 1/54 that of the average surface of the full moon.\r\n\r\nThe Russian eclipse of August 19, 1887, can only be remembered as a\r\ndisastrous failure. Much was expected of it. The shadow-path ran\r\noverland from Leipsic to the Japanese sea, so that the solar\r\nappurtenances would, it was hoped, be disclosed to observers echeloned\r\nalong a line of 6,000 miles. But the incalculable element of weather\r\nrendered all forecasts nugatory. The clouds never parted, during the\r\ncritical three minutes, over Central Russia, where many parties were\r\nstationed, and Professor D. P. Todd was equally unfortunate in Japan.\r\nSome good photographs were, nevertheless, secured by Professor Arai,\r\nDirector of the Tokio Observatory, as well as by MM. Bélopolsky and\r\nGlasenapp at Petrovsk and Jurjevitch respectively. They showed a corona\r\nof simpler form than that of the year before, but not yet of the\r\npronounced type first associated by Mr. Ranyard with the lowest stage of\r\nsolar activity.\r\n\r\nThe genuineness of the association was ratified by the duplicate\r\nspectacle of the next-ensuing minimum year. Two total eclipses of the\r\nsun distinguished 1889. The first took place on New Year's Day, when a\r\nnarrow shadow-path crossed California, allowing less than two minutes\r\nfor the numerous experiments prompted by the varied nature of modern\r\nmethods of research. American astronomers availed themselves of the\r\noccasion to the full. The heavens were propitious. Photographic records\r\nwere obtained in unprecedented abundance, and of unusual excellence.\r\nTheir comparison and study placed it beyond reasonable doubt that the\r\nradiated corona belonging to periods of maximum sun-spots gives place,\r\nat periods of minimum, to the \"winged\" type of 1878. Professor Holden\r\nperceived further that the equatorial extensions characterising the\r\nlatter tend to assume a \"trumpet-shape.\"[563] Their extremities diverge,\r\nas if mutually repellent, instead of flowing together along a medial\r\nplane. The maximum actinic brilliancy of the corona of January 1, 1889,\r\nwas determined at Lick to be twenty-one times less than that of the full\r\nmoon.[564] Its colour was described as \"of an intense luminous silver,\r\nwith a bluish tinge, similar to the light of an electric arc.\"[565] Its\r\nspectrum was comparatively simple. Very few bright lines besides those\r\nof hydrogen and coronium, and apparently no dark ones, stood out from\r\nthe prismatic background.\r\n\r\n\"The marked structural features of the corona, as presented by the\r\nnegatives\" taken by Professors Nipher and Charroppin, were the filaments\r\nand the streamers. The filaments issued from polar calottes of 20°\r\nradius.\r\n\r\n\"The impression conveyed to the eye,\" Professor Pritchett wrote,[566]\r\n\"is that the equatorial stream of denser coronal matter extends across\r\nand through the filaments, simply obscuring them by its greater\r\nbrightness. The effect is just as if the equatorial belt were superposed\r\nupon, or passed through, the filamentary structure. There is nothing in\r\nthe photographs to prove that the filaments do not exist all round the\r\nsun.[567] The testimony from negatives of different lengths of exposure\r\ngoes to show that the equatorial streamers are made up of numerous\r\ninterlacing parts inclined at varying angles to the sun's equator.\"\r\n\r\nThe coronal extensions, perceptible with the naked eye to a distance of\r\nmore than 3° from the sun, appeared barely one-third of that length on\r\nthe best negatives. Little more could be seen of them either in\r\nBarnard's exquisite miniature pictures, or in the photographs obtained\r\nby W. H. Pickering with a thirteen-inch refractor--the largest\r\ninstrument so far used in eclipse-photography.\r\n\r\nThe total eclipse of December 22, 1889, held out a prospect,\r\nunfortunately not realized, of removing some of the doubts and\r\ndifficulties that impeded the progress of coronal photography.[568]\r\nMessrs. Burnham and Schaeberle secured at Cayenne some excellent\r\nimpressions, showing enough of the corona to prove its identical\r\ncharacter with that depicted in the beginning of the year, but not\r\nenough to convey additional information about its terminal forms or\r\ninnermost structure. Any better result was indeed impossible, the\r\nmoisture-laden air having cut down the actinic power of the coronal\r\nlight to one-fourth its previous value.\r\n\r\nTwo English expeditions organized by the Royal Astronomical Society\r\nfared still worse. Mr. Taylor was stationed on the West Coast of Africa,\r\none hundred miles south of Loanda; Father Perry chose as the scene of\r\nhis operations the Salut Islands, off French Guiana. Each was supplied\r\nwith a reflector constructed by Dr. Common, endowed, by its extremely\r\nshort focal length of forty-five, combined with an aperture of twenty\r\ninches, with a light-concentrating force capable, it was hoped, of\r\ncompelling the very filmiest coronal branches to self-registration. Had\r\nthings gone well two sets of coronal pictures, absolutely comparable in\r\nevery respect, and taken at an interval of two hours and a half, would\r\nhave been at the disposal of astronomers. But things went very far from\r\nwell. Clouds altogether obscured the sun in Africa; they only separated\r\nto allow of his shining through a saturated atmosphere in South America.\r\nFather Perry's observations were the last heroic effort of a dying man.\r\nStricken with malaria, he crawled to the hospital as soon as the eclipse\r\nwas over, and expired five days later, at sea, on board the _Comus_. He\r\nwas buried at Barbados. And the sacrifice of his life had, after all,\r\npurchased no decisive success. Most of the plates exposed by him\r\nsuffered deterioration from the climate, or from an inevitably delayed\r\ndevelopment. A drawing from the best of them by Miss Violet Common[569]\r\nrepresented a corona differing from its predecessor of January 1,\r\nchiefly through the oppositely unsymmetrical relations of its parts.\r\nThen the western wing had been broader at its base than the eastern; now\r\nthe inequality was conspicuously the other way.[570]\r\n\r\nThe next opportunity for retrieving the mischances of the past was\r\noffered April 16, 1893. The line of totality charted for that day ran\r\nfrom Chili to Senegambia. American parties appropriated the Andes; both\r\nshores of the Atlantic were in English occupation; French expeditions,\r\nled by Deslandres and Bigourdan, took up posts south of Cape Verde. A\r\nlong totality of more than four minutes was favoured by serene skies;\r\nhence an ample store of photographic data was obtained. Professor\r\nSchaeberle, of the Lick Observatory, took, almost without assistance, at\r\nMina Bronces, a mining station 6,600 feet above the Pacific, fifty-two\r\nnegatives, eight of them with a forty-foot telescope, on a scale of four\r\nand a half inches to the solar diameter. Not only the inner corona, but\r\nthe array of prominences then conspicuous, appeared in them to be\r\ncomposed of fibrous jets and arches, held to be sections of elliptic\r\norbits described by luminous particles about the sun's centre.[571] One\r\nplate received the impression of a curious object,[572] entangled amidst\r\ncoronal streamers, and the belief in its cometary nature was ratified by\r\nthe bestowal of a comet-medal in recognition of the discovery. Similiar\r\nparaboloidal forms had, nevertheless, occasionally been seen to make an\r\nintegral part of earlier coronas; and it remains extremely doubtful\r\nwhether Schaeberle's \"eclipse-comet\" was justly entitled to the\r\ncharacter claimed for it.\r\n\r\nThe eclipse of 1893 disclosed a radiated corona such as a year of\r\nspot-maximum was sure to bring. An unexpected fact about it was,\r\nhowever, ascertained. The coronal has been believed to have much in\r\ncommon with the chromospheric spectrum; it proved, on investigation with\r\na large prismatic camera, employed under Sir Norman Lockyer's directions\r\nby Mr. Fowler at Fundium, to be absolutely distinct from it. The\r\nfundamental green ray had, on the West African plates, seven more\r\nrefrangible associates;[573] but all alike are of unknown origin. They\r\nmay be due to many substances, or to one; future research will perhaps\r\ndecide; we can at present only say that the gaseous emission of the\r\ncorona include none from hydrogen, helium, calcium, or any other\r\nrecognisable terrestrial element. Deslandres' attempt to determine the\r\nrotation of the corona through opposite displacements, east and west of\r\nthe interposed moon, of the violet calcium-lines supposed to make part\r\nof the coronal spectrum, was thus rendered nugatory. Yet it gave an\r\nearnest of success, by definitely introducing the subject into the\r\nconstantly lengthened programme of eclipse-work. There is, however,\r\nlittle prospect of its being treated effectively until the green line is\r\nvivified by a fresh access of solar activity.\r\n\r\nThe flight of the moon's shadow was, on August 9, 1896, dogged by\r\natrocious weather. It traversed, besides, some of the most inhospitable\r\nregions on the earth's surface, and afforded, at the best, but a brief\r\ninterval of obscurity. At Novaya Zemlya, however, of all places, the\r\nconditions were tolerably favourable, and, as we have seen, the trophy\r\nof a \"flash-spectrograph\" was carried off. Some coronal photographs,\r\nmoreover, taken by the late Sir George Baden-Powell[574] and by M.\r\nHansky, a member of a Russian party, were marked by features of\r\nconsiderable interest. They made apparent a close connection between\r\ncoronal outflows and chromospheric jets, cone-shaped beams serving as\r\nthe sheaths, or envelopes, of prominences. M. Hansky,[575] indeed,\r\nthought that every streamer had a chromospheric eruption at its base.\r\nFurther, dark veinings of singular shapes unmistakably interrupted the\r\ncoronal light, and bordered brilliant prominences,[576] reminding us of\r\ncertain \"black lines\" traced by Swift across the \"anvil protuberance\"\r\nAugust 7, 1869.[577] In type the corona of 1896 reproduced that of 1886,\r\nas befitted its intermediate position in the solar cycle.\r\n\r\nThe eclipse-track on January 22, 1898, crossed the Indian peninsula from\r\nViziadrug, on the Malabar coast, to Mount Everest in the Himalayas. Not\r\na cloud obstructed the view anywhere, and an unprecedented harvest of\r\nphotographic records was garnered. The flash-spectrum, in its successive\r\nphases, appeared on plates taken by Sir Norman Lockyer, Mr. Evershed,\r\nProfessor Campbell,[578] and others; Professor Turner[579] set on foot a\r\nnovel mode of research by picturing the corona in the polarised\r\ningredient of its light; Mrs. Maunder[580] practically solved the\r\nproblem of photographing the faint coronal extensions, one ray on her\r\nplates running out to nearly six diameters from the moon's limb. Yet she\r\nused a Dallmeyer lens of only one and a half inches aperture. Her\r\nsuccess accorded perfectly with Professor Wadsworth's conclusion that\r\neffectiveness in delineation by slight contrasts of luminosity varies\r\ninversely with aperture. Triple-coated plates, and a comparatively long\r\nexposure of twenty seconds, contributed to a result unlikely, for some\r\ntime, to be surpassed. The corona of 1898 presented a mixed aspect. The\r\npolar plumes due at minimum were combined in it with the quadrilateral\r\nogives belonging to spot-maxima. A slow course of transformation, in\r\nfact, seemed in progress; and it was found to be completed in 1900, when\r\nthe eclipse of May 28 revealed the typical halo of a quiescent sun.\r\n\r\nThe obscurity on this occasion was short--less than 100 seconds--but was\r\nwell observed east and west of the Atlantic. No striking gain in\r\nknowledge, however, resulted. Important experiments were indeed made on\r\nthe heat of the corona with Langley's bolometer, but their upshot can\r\nscarcely be admitted as decisive. They indicated a marked deficiency of\r\nthermal radiations, implying for coronal light, in Professor Langley's\r\nopinion,[581] an origin analogous to that of the electric\r\nglow-discharge, which, at low pressures, was found by K. Ångström in\r\n1893 to have no invisible heat-spectrum.[582] The corona was\r\nphotographed by Professor Barnard, at Wadesborough, North Carolina, with\r\na 61-1/2-foot horizontal \"coelostat.\" In this instrument, of a type now\r\nmuch employed in eclipse operations and first recommended by Professor\r\nTurner, a six-inch photographic objective preserved an invariable\r\nposition, while a silvered plane mirror, revolving by clockwork once in\r\nforty-eight hours (since the angle of movement is doubled by\r\nreflection), supplied the light it brought to a focus. A temporary\r\nwooden tube connected the lens with the photographic house where the\r\nplates were exposed. Pictures thus obtained with exposures of from one\r\nto fourteen seconds, were described as \"remarkably sharp and perfectly\r\ndefined, showing the prominences and inner corona very beautifully. The\r\npolar fans came out magnificently.\"[583]\r\n\r\nThe great Sumatra eclipse left behind it manifold memories of foiled\r\nexpectations. A totality of above six minutes drew observers to the Far\r\nEast from several continents, each cherishing a plan of inquiry which\r\nfew were destined to execute. All along the line of shadow, which, on\r\nMay 18, 1901, crossed Réunion and Mauritius, and again met land at\r\nSumatra and Borneo, the meteorological forecast was dubious, and the\r\nmeteorological actuality in the main deplorable. Nevertheless, the\r\ncorona was seen, and fairly well photographed through drifting clouds,\r\nand proved to resemble in essentials the appendage viewed a year\r\npreviously. Negatives taken by members of the Lick Observatory\r\nexpedition led by Mr. Perrine[584] disclosed the unique phenomenon of a\r\nviolent coronal disturbance, with a small compact prominence as its\r\napparent focus. Tumbling masses and irregular streamers radiating from a\r\npoint subsequently shown by the Greenwich photographs to be the seat of\r\na conspicuous spot, suggested the recent occurrence of an explosion, the\r\nfar-reaching effects of which might be traced in the confused floccular\r\nluminosity of a vast surrounding region. Again, photographs in polarised\r\nlight attested the radiance of the outer corona to be in large measure\r\nreflected, while that of the inner ring was original; and the inference\r\nwas confirmed by spectrographs, recording many Fraunhofer lines when the\r\nslit lay far from the sun's limb, but none in its immediate vicinity. On\r\nplates exposed by Mr. Dyson and Dr. Humphrys with special apparatus, the\r\ncoronal spectrum, continuous and linear, impressed itself more\r\nextensively in the ultra-violet than on any previous occasion; and Dr.\r\nMitchell succeeded in photographing the reversing layer by means of a\r\ngrating spectroscope. Finally, Mrs. Maunder, at Mauritius, despite\r\nmischievous atmospheric tremors, obtained with the Newbegin telescope an\r\nexcellent series of coronal pictures.[585]\r\n\r\nThe principles of explanation applied to the corona may be briefly\r\ndescribed as eruptive and electrical. The first was adopted by Professor\r\nSchaeberle in his \"Mechanical Theory,\" advanced in 1890.[586] According\r\nto this view, the eclipse-halo consists of streams of matter shot out\r\nwith great velocity from the spot-zones by forces acting perpendicularly\r\nto the sun's surface. The component particles return to the sun after\r\ndescribing sections of extremely elongated ellipses, unless their\r\ninitial speed happen to equal or exceed the critical rate of 383 miles a\r\nsecond, in which case they are finally driven off into space. The\r\nperspective overlapping and interlacing of these incandescent outflows\r\nwas supposed to occasion the intricacies of texture visible in the\r\ncorona; and it should be recorded that a virtually identical conclusion\r\nwas reached by Mr. Perrine in 1901,[587] by a different train of\r\nreasoning, based upon a distinct set of facts. A theory on very much the\r\nsame lines was, moreover, worked out by M. Bélopolsky in 1897.[588]\r\nSchaeberle, however, had the merit of making the first adequate effort\r\nto deduce the real shape of the corona, as it exists in three\r\ndimensions, from its projection upon the surface of the sphere. He\r\nfailed, indeed, to account for the variation in coronal types by the\r\nchanges in our situation with regard to the sun's equator. It is only\r\nnecessary to remark that, if this were so, they should be subject to an\r\nannual periodicity, of which no trace can be discerned.\r\n\r\nElectro-magnetic theories have the charm, and the drawback, of dealing\r\nlargely with the unknown. But they are gradually losing the vague and\r\nintangible character which long clung to them; and the improved\r\ndefinition of their outlines has not, so far, brought them into\r\ndisaccord with truth. The most promising hypothesis of the kind is due\r\nto Professor Bigelow of Washington. His able discussion of the eclipse\r\nphotographs of January 1, 1889,[589] showed a striking agreement between\r\nthe observed coronal forms and the calculated effects of a repulsive\r\ninfluence obeying the laws of electric potential, also postulated by\r\nHuggins in 1885.[590] Finely subdivided matter, expelled from the sun\r\nalong lines of force emanating from the neighbourhood of his poles, thus\r\ntends to accumulate at \"equipotential surfaces.\" In deference, however,\r\nto a doubt more strongly felt then than now, whether the presence of\r\nfree electricity is compatible with the solar temperature, he avoided\r\nany express assertion that the coronal structure is an electrical\r\nphenomenon, merely pointing out that, if it were, its details would be\r\njust what they are.\r\n\r\nLater, in 1892, Pupin in America,[591] and Ebert in Germany,[592]\r\nimitated the coronal streamers by means of electrical discharges in low\r\nvacua between small conducting bodies and strips of tinfoil placed on\r\nthe outside of the containing glass receptacles. Finally, a critical\r\nexperiment made by Ebert in 1895 served, as Bigelow justly said, \"to\r\nclear up the entire subject, and put the theory on a working basis.\"\r\nHaving obtained coronoidal effects in the manner described, he proceeded\r\nto subject them to the action of a strong magnetic field, with the\r\nresult of marshalling the scattered rays into a methodical and highly\r\nsuggestive array. They followed the direction of the magnetic lines of\r\nforce, and, forsaking the polar collar of the magnetised sphere,\r\nsurrounded it like a ruffle. The obvious analogy with the aurora polaris\r\nand the solar corona was insisted upon by Ebert himself, and has been\r\nfurther developed by Bigelow.[593] According to a recent modification of\r\nhis hypothesis, the latter appendage is controlled by two opposing\r\nsystems of forces; the magnetic causing the rays to diverge from the\r\npoles towards the equator, and the electrostatic urging their spread,\r\nthrough the mutual repulsion of the particles accumulated in the\r\n\"wings,\" from the equator towards either pole. The cyclical change in\r\nthe corona, he adds, is probably due to a variation in the balance of\r\npower thus established, the magnetic polar influence dominating at\r\nminima, the electrostatic at maxima. And he may well feel encouraged by\r\nthe fortunate combination of many experimental details into one\r\nexplanatory whole, no less than by the hopeful prospect of further\r\ndevelopments, both practical and theoretical, along the same lines.\r\n\r\nWhat we really know about the corona can be summed up in a few words. It\r\nis certainly _not_ a solar atmosphere. It does not gravitate upon the\r\nsun's surface and share his rotation, as our air gravitates upon and\r\nshares the rotation of the earth; and this for the simple reason that\r\nthere is no visible growth of pressure downwards (of which the\r\nspectroscope would infallibly give notice) in its gaseous constituents;\r\nwhereas under the sole influence of the sun's attractive power, their\r\ndensity should be multiplied many million times in the descent through a\r\nmere fraction of their actual depth.[594]\r\n\r\nThey are apparently in a perpetual state of efflux from, and influx to\r\nour great luminary, under the stress of opposing forces. It is not\r\nunlikely that some part, at least, of the coronal materials are provided\r\nby eruptions from the body of the sun;[595] it is almost certain that\r\nthey are organized and arranged round it through electro-magnetic\r\naction. This, however, would seem to be influential only upon their\r\nwhite-hot or reflective ingredients, out of which the streamers and\r\naigrettes are composed; since the coronal gases appear, from\r\nobservations during eclipses, to form a shapeless envelope, with\r\ncondensations above the spot-zones, or at the bases of equatorial\r\nextensions. The corona is undoubtedly affected both in shape and\r\nconstitution by the periodic ebb and flow of solar activity, its\r\nlow-tide form being winged, its high-tide form stellate; while the rays\r\nemitted by the gases contained in it fade, and the continuous spectrum\r\nbrightens, at times of minimum sun-spots. The appendage, as a whole,\r\nmust be of inconceivable tenuity, since comets cut their way through it\r\nwithout experiencing sensible retardation. Not even Sir William\r\nCrookes's vacua can give an idea of the rarefaction which this fact\r\nimplies. Yet the observed luminous effects may not in reality bear\r\nwitness contradictory of it. One solitary molecule in each cubic inch of\r\nspace might, in Professor Young's opinion, produce them; while in the\r\nsame volume of ordinary air at the sea-level, the molecules number\r\n(according to Dr. Johnstone Stoney) 20,000 trillions!\r\n\r\nThe most important lesson, however, derived from eclipses is that of\r\npartial independence of them. Some of its fruits in the daily study of\r\nprominences the next chapter will collect; and the harvest has been\r\nrendered more abundant, as well as more valuable, since it has been\r\nfound possible to enlist, in this department too, the versatile aid of\r\nthe camera.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 512: _Vierteljahrsschrift Astr.

Norton, of Yale College, appears to have\r\nbeen the earliest formal advocate of the Expulsion Theory of the solar\r\nsurroundings, in the second (1845) and later editions of his _Treatise\r\non Astronomy_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                          _SOLAR SPECTROSCOPY_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new way struck out by Janssen and Lockyer was at once and eagerly\r\nfollowed. In every part of Europe, as well as in North America,\r\nobservers devoted themselves to the daily study of the chromosphere and\r\nprominences. Foremost among these were Lockyer in England, Zöllner at\r\nLeipzig, Spörer at Anclam, Young at Hanover, New Hampshire, Secchi and\r\nRespighi at Rome. There were many others, but these names stood out\r\nconspicuously.\r\n\r\nThe first point to be cleared up was that of chemical composition.\r\nLeisurely measurements verified the presence above the sun's surface of\r\nhydrogen in prodigious volumes, but showed that sodium had nothing to do\r\nwith the orange-yellow ray identified with it in the haste of the\r\neclipse. From its vicinity to the D-pair (than which it is slightly more\r\nrefrangible), the prominence-line was, however, designated D_3, and the\r\nunknown substance emitting it was named by Lockyer \"helium.\" Its\r\nterrestrial discovery ensued after twenty-six years. In March, 1895,\r\nProfessor Ramsay obtained from the rare mineral clevite a volatile gas,\r\nthe spectrum of which was found to include the yellow prominence-ray.\r\nHelium was actually at hand, and available for examination. The\r\nidentification cleared up many obscurities in chromospheric chemistry.\r\nSeveral bright lines, persistently seen at the edge of the sun, and\r\nearly suspected by Young[596] to emanate from the same source as D_3,\r\nwere now derived from helium in the laboratory; and all the complex\r\nemissions of that exotic substance ranged themselves into six sets or\r\nseries, the members of which are mutually connected by numerical\r\nrelations of a definite and simple kind. Helium is of rather more than\r\ntwice the density of hydrogen, and has no chemical affinities. In almost\r\nevanescent quantities it lurks in the earth's crust, and is diffused\r\nthrough the earth's atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the part played in the prominence-spectrum by the\r\nviolet line of calcium was noticed by Professor Young in 1872, but since\r\nH and K lie near the limit of the visible spectrum, photography was\r\nneeded for a thorough investigation of their appearances. Aided by its\r\nresources, Professor George E. Hale, then at the beginning of his\r\ncareer, detected in 1889 their unfailing and conspicuous presence.[597]\r\nThe substance emitting them not only constitutes a fundamental\r\ningredient of the chromosphere, but rises, in the fantastic jets thence\r\nissuing, to greater heights than hydrogen itself. The isolation of H and\r\nK in solar prominences from any other of the lines usually distinctive\r\nof calcium was experimentally proved by Sir William and Lady Huggins in\r\n1897 to be due to the extreme tenuity of the emitting vapour.[598]\r\n\r\nHydrogen, helium, and calcium form, then, the chief and unvarying\r\nmaterials of the solar sierra and its peaks; but a number of metallic\r\nelements make their appearance spasmodically under the influence of\r\ndisturbances in the layers beneath. In September, 1871, Young[599] drew\r\nup at Dartmouth College a list of 103 lines significant of injections\r\ninto the chromosphere of iron, titanium, chromium, magnesium, and many\r\nother substances. During two months' observation in the pure air of\r\nMount Sherman (8,335 feet high) in the summer of 1872, these tell-tale\r\nlines mounted up to 273;[600] and he believes their number might still\r\nbe doubled by steady watching. Indeed, both Young and Lockyer have more\r\nthan once seen the whole field of the spectroscope momentarily inundated\r\nwith bright rays, as if the \"reversing layer\" had been suddenly thrust\r\nupwards into the chromosphere, and as quickly allowed to drop back\r\nagain. The opinion would thus appear to be well-grounded that the two\r\nform one continuous region, of which the lower parts are habitually\r\noccupied by the heaviest vapours, but where orderly arrangement is\r\ncontinually overturned by violent eruptive disturbances.\r\n\r\nThe study of the _forms_ of prominences practically began with Huggins's\r\nobservation of one through an \"open slit\" February 13, 1869.[601] At\r\nfirst it had been thought possible to examine them only in\r\nsections--that is, by admitting mere narrow strips or \"lines\" of their\r\nvarious kinds of light; while the actual shape of the objects emitting\r\nthose lines had been arrived at by such imperfect devices as that of\r\ngiving to the slit of the spectroscope a vibratory moment rapid enough\r\nto enable the eye to retain the impression of one part while others were\r\nsuccessively presented to it. It was an immense gain to find that their\r\nrays had strength to bear so much of dilution with ordinary light as was\r\ninvolved in opening the spectroscopic shutter wide enough to exhibit the\r\ntree-like, or horn-like, or flame-shaped bodies rising over the sun's\r\nrim in their undivided proportions. Several diversely-coloured images of\r\nthem are formed in the spectroscope; each may be seen under a crimson, a\r\nyellow, a green, and a deep blue aspect. The crimson, however (built up\r\nout of the C-line of hydrogen), is the most intense, and is commonly\r\nused for purposes of observation and illustration.\r\n\r\nFriedrich Zöllner was, by a few days, beforehand with Huggins in\r\ndescribing the open-slit method, but was somewhat less prompt in\r\napplying it. His first survey of a complete prominence, pictured in, and\r\nnot simply intersected by, the slit of his spectroscope, was obtained\r\nJuly 1, 1869.[602] Shortly afterwards the plan was successfully adopted\r\nby the whole band of investigators.\r\n\r\nA difference in kind was very soon perceived to separate these objects\r\ninto two well-marked classes. Its natural and obvious character was\r\nshown by its having struck several observers independently. The\r\ndistinction of \"cloud-prominences\" from \"flame-prominences\" was\r\nannounced by Lockyer, April 27; by Zöllner, June 2; and by Respighi,\r\nDecember 4, 1870.\r\n\r\nThe first description are tranquil and relatively permanent, sometimes\r\nenduring without striking change for many days. Certain of the included\r\nspecies mimic terrestrial cloud-scenery--now appearing like fleecy\r\ncirrus transpenetrated with the red glow of sunset--now like prodigious\r\nmasses of cumulo-stratus hanging heavily above the horizon. The solar\r\nclouds, however, have the peculiarity of possessing _stems_. Slender\r\ncolumns can ordinarily be seen to connect the surface of the\r\nchromosphere with its outlying portions. Hence the fantastic likeness to\r\nforest scenery presented by the long ranges of fiery trunks and foliage\r\noccasionally seeming to fringe the sun's limb. But while this mode of\r\nstructure suggests an actual outpouring of incandescent material,\r\ncertain facts require a different interpretation. At a distance, and\r\nquite apart from the chromosphere, prominences have been perceived, both\r\nby Secchi and Young, to _form_, just as clouds form in a clear sky,\r\ncondensation being replaced by ignition. Filaments were then thrown out\r\ndownward towards the chromosphere, and finally the usual appearance of a\r\n\"stemmed prominence\" was assumed. Still more remarkable was an\r\nobservation made by Trouvelot at Harvard College Observatory, June 26,\r\n1874.[603] A gigantic comma-shaped prominence, 82,000 miles high,\r\nvanished from before his eyes by a withdrawal of light as sudden as the\r\npassage of a flash of lightning. The same observer has frequently\r\nwitnessed a gradual illumination or gradual extinction of such objects,\r\ntestifying to changes in the thermal or electrical condition of matter\r\nalready _in situ_.\r\n\r\nThe first photograph of a prominence, as shown by the spectroscope in\r\ndaylight, was taken by Professor Young in 1870.[604] But neither his\r\nmethod, nor that described by Dr. Braun in 1872,[605] had any practical\r\nsuccess. This was reserved to reward the efforts towards the same end of\r\nProfessor Hale. Begun at Harvard College in 1889,[606] they were\r\nprosecuted soon afterwards at the Kenwood Observatory, Chicago. The\r\ngreat difficulty was to extricate the coloured image of the gaseous\r\nstructure, spectroscopically visible at the sun's limb, from the\r\nencompassing glare, a very little of which goes a long way in _fogging_\r\nsensitive plates. To counteract its mischievous effects, a second\r\nslit,[607] besides the usual narrow one in front of the collimator, was\r\nplaced on guard, as it were, behind the dispersing apparatus, so as to\r\nshut out from the sensitised surface all light save that of the required\r\nquality. The sun's image being then allowed to drift across the outer\r\nslit, while the plate holder was kept moving at the same rate, the\r\nsuccessive sectional impressions thus rapidly obtained finally \"built\r\nup\" a complete picture of the prominence. Another expedient was soon\r\nafterwards contrived.[608] The H and K rays of calcium are always, as we\r\nhave seen, bright in the spectrum of prominences. They are besides fine\r\nand sharp, while the corresponding absorption-lines in the ordinary\r\nsolar spectrum are wide and diffuse. Hence, prominences formed by the\r\nspectroscope out of these particular qualities of violet light, can be\r\nphotographed entire and at once, for the simple reason that they are\r\nprojected upon a naturally darkened background. Atmospheric glare is\r\nabolished by local absorption. This beautiful method was first realised\r\nby Professor Hale in June, 1891.\r\n\r\nA \"spectroheliograph,\" consisting of a spectroscopic and a photographic\r\napparatus of special type, attached to the eye-end of an equatoreal\r\ntwelve inches in aperture, was erected at Kenwood in March, 1891; and\r\nwith its aid, Professor Hale entered upon original researches of high\r\npromise for the advancement of solar physics. Noteworthy above all is\r\nhis achievement of photographing both prominences and faculæ on the very\r\nface of the sun. The latter had, until then, been very imperfectly\r\nobserved. They were only visible, in fact, when relieved by their\r\nbrilliancy against the dusky edge of the solar disc. Their convenient\r\nemission of calcium light, however, makes it possible to photograph them\r\nin all positions, and emphasises their close relationship to\r\nprominences. The simultaneous picturing, moreover, of the entire\r\nchromospheric ring, with whatever trees or fountains of fire chance to\r\nbe at the moment issuing from it, has been accomplished by a very simple\r\ndevice. The disc of the sun itself having been screened with a circular\r\nmetallic diaphragm, it is only necessary to cause the slit to traverse\r\nthe virtually eclipsed luminary, in order to get an impression of the\r\nwhole round of its fringing appendages. And the record can be extended\r\nto the disc by removing the screen, and carrying the slit back at a\r\nquicker rate, when an \"image of the sun's surface, with the faculæ and\r\nspots, is formed on the plate exactly within the image of the\r\nchromosphere formed during the first exposure. The whole operation,\"\r\nProfessor Hale continues, \"is completed in less than a minute, and the\r\nresulting photographs give the first true pictures of the sun, showing\r\nall of the various phenomena at its surface.\"[609] Most of these novel\r\nresearches were, by a remarkable coincidence, pursued independently and\r\ncontemporaneously by M. Deslandres, of the Paris Observatory.[610]\r\n\r\nThe ultra-violet prominence spectrum was photographed for the first time\r\nfrom an uneclipsed sun, in June, 1891, at Chicago. Besides H and K, four\r\nmembers of the Huggins-series of hydrogen-lines imprinted themselves on\r\nthe plate.[611] Meanwhile M. Deslandres was enabled, by fitting quartz\r\nlenses to his spectroscope, and substituting a reflecting for a\r\nrefracting telescope, to get rid of the obstructive action of glass upon\r\nthe shorter light-waves, and thus to widen the scope of his inquiry into\r\nthe peculiarities of those derived from prominences.[612] As the result,\r\nnot only all the nine white-star lines were photographed from a\r\nbrilliant sun-flame, but five additional ones were found to continue the\r\nseries upward. The wave-lengths of these last had, moreover, been\r\ncalculated beforehand with singular exactness, from a simple formula\r\nknown as \"Balmer's Law.\"[613] The new lines, accordingly, filled places\r\nin a manner already prepared for them, and were thus unmistakably\r\nassociated with the hydrogen-spectrum. This is now known to be\r\nrepresented in prominences by twenty-seven lines,[614] forming a kind of\r\nharmonic progression, only four of which are visibly darkened in the\r\nFraunhofer spectrum of the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE I.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photographs of the Solar Chromosphere and Prominences.\r\n\r\nTaken with the Spectroheliograph of the Kenwood Observatory, Chicago, by\r\nProfessor George E. Hale.]\r\n\r\nThe chemistry of \"cloud-prominences\" is simple. Hydrogen, helium, and\r\ncalcium are their chief constituents. \"Flame-prominences,\" on the other\r\nhand, show, in addition, the characteristic rays of a number of metals,\r\namong which iron, titanium, barium, strontium, sodium, and magnesium are\r\nconspicuous. They are intensely brilliant; sharply defined in their\r\nvarying forms of jets, spikes, fountains, waterspouts; of rapid\r\nformation and speedy dissolution, seldom attaining to the vast\r\ndimensions of the more tranquil kind. Eruptive or explosive by origin,\r\nthey occur in close connection with spots; whether causally, the\r\nmaterials ejected as \"flames\" cooling and settling down as dark,\r\ndepressed patches of increased absorption;[615] or consequentially, as a\r\nreactive effect of falls of solidified substances from great heights in\r\nthe solar atmosphere.[616] The two classes of phenomena, at any rate,\r\nstand in a most intimate relation; they obey the same law of\r\nperiodicity, and are confined to the same portions of the sun's surface,\r\nwhile quiescent prominences may be found right up to the poles and close\r\nto the equator.\r\n\r\nThe general distribution of prominences, including both genera, follows\r\nthat of faculæ much more closely than that of spots. From Father\r\nSecchi's and Professor Respighi's observations, 1869-71, were derived\r\nthe first clear ideas on the subject, which have been supplemented and\r\nmodified by the later researches of Professors Tacchini and Riccò at\r\nRome and Palermo. The results are somewhat complicated, but may be\r\nstated broadly as follows. The district of greatest prominence-frequency\r\ncovers and overlaps by several degrees that of the greatest\r\nspot-frequency. That is to say, it extends to about 40° north and south\r\nof the equator.[617] There is a visible tendency to a second pair of\r\nmaxima nearer the poles. The poles themselves, as well as the equator,\r\nare regions of minimum occurrence. Distribution in time is governed by\r\nthe spot-cycle, but the maximum lasts longer for prominences than for\r\nspots.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the chromosphere was investigated in 1869 and\r\nsubsequent years by Professor Respighi, director of the Capitoline\r\nObservatory, as well as by Spörer, and Brédikhine of the Moscow\r\nObservatory. They found this supposed solar envelope to be of the same\r\neruptive nature as the vast protrusions from it, and to be made up of a\r\ncongeries of minute flames[618] set close together like blades of grass.\r\n\"The appearance,\" Professor Young writes,[619] \"which probably indicates\r\na fact, is as if countless jets of heated gas were issuing through vents\r\nand spiracles over the whole surface, thus clothing it with flame which\r\nheaves and tosses like the blaze of a conflagration.\"\r\n\r\nThe summits of these filaments of fire are commonly inclined, as if by a\r\nwind sweeping over them, when the sun's activity is near its height, but\r\nerect during his phase of tranquillity. Spörer, in 1871, inferred the\r\ninfluence of permanent polar currents,[620] but Tacchini showed in 1876\r\nthat the deflections upon which this inference was based ceased to be\r\nvisible as the spot-minimum drew near.[621]\r\n\r\nAnother peculiarity of the chromosphere, denoting the remoteness of its\r\ncharacter from that of a true atmosphere,[622] is the irregularity of\r\nits distribution over the sun's surface. There are no signs of its\r\nbulging out at the equator, as the laws of fluid equilibrium in a\r\nrotating mass would require; but there are some that the fluctuations in\r\nits depth are connected with the phases of solar agitation. At times of\r\nminimum it seems to accumulate and concentrate its activity at the\r\npoles; while maxima probably bring a more equable general distribution,\r\nwith local depressions at the base of great prominences and above spots.\r\n\r\nA low-lying stratum of carbon-vapour was, in 1897, detected in the\r\nchromosphere by Professor Hale with a grating-spectroscope attached to\r\nthe 40-inch Yerkes refractor.[623] The eclipse-photographs of 1893\r\ndisclosed to Hartley's examination the presence there of gallium;[624]\r\nand those taken by Evershed in 1898 were found by Jewell[625] to be\r\ncrowded with ultra-violet lines of the equally rare metal scandium. The\r\ngeneral rule had been laid down by Sir Norman Lockyer that the metallic\r\nradiations from the chromosphere are those \"enhanced\" in the electric\r\nspark.[626] Hence, the comparative study of conditions prevalent in the\r\narc and the spark has acquired great importance in solar physics.\r\n\r\nThe reality of the appearance of violent disturbance presented by the\r\n\"flaming\" kind of prominence can be tested in a very remarkable manner.\r\nChristian Doppler,[627] professor of mathematics at Prague, enounced in\r\n1842 the theorm that the colour of a luminous body, like the pitch of a\r\nsonorous body, must be changed by movements of approach or recession.\r\nThe reason is this. Both colour and pitch are physiological effects,\r\ndepending, not upon absolute wave-length, but upon the number of waves\r\nentering the eye or ear in a given interval of time. And this number, it\r\nis easy to see, must be increased if the source of light or sound is\r\ndiminishing its distance, and diminished if it is decreasing it. In the\r\none case, the vibrating body _pursues_ and crowds together the waves\r\nemanating from it; in the other, it _retreats_ from them, and so\r\nlengthens out the space covered by an identical number. The principle\r\nmay be thus illustrated. Suppose shots to be fired at a target at fixed\r\nintervals of time. If the marksman advances, say twenty paces between\r\neach discharge of his rifle, it is evident that the shots will fall\r\nfaster on the target than if he stood still; if, on the contrary, he\r\nretires by the same amount, they will strike at correspondingly longer\r\nintervals. The result will of course be the same whether the target or\r\nthe marksman be in movement.\r\n\r\nSo far Doppler was altogether right. As regards sound, anyone can\r\nconvince himself that the effect he predicted is a real one, by\r\nlistening to the alternate shrilling and sinking of the steam-whistle\r\nwhen an express train rushes through a station. But in applying this\r\nprinciple to the colours of stars he went widely astray; for he omitted\r\nfrom consideration the double range of invisible vibrations which\r\npartake of, and to the eye exactly compensate, changes of refrangibility\r\nin the visible rays. There is, then, no possibility of finding a\r\ncriterion of velocity in the hue of bodies shining, like the sun and\r\nstars, with continuous light. The entire spectrum is slightly shifted up\r\nor down in the scale of refrangibility; certain rays normally visible\r\nbecome exalted or degraded (as the case may be) into invisibility, and\r\ncertain other rays at the opposite end undergo the converse process; but\r\nthe sum total of impressions on the retina continues the same.\r\n\r\nWe are not, however, without the means of measuring this sub-sensible\r\ntransportation of the light-gamut. Once more the wonderful Fraunhofer\r\nlines came to the rescue. They were called by the earlier physicists\r\n\"fixed lines;\" but it is just because they are _not_ fixed that, in this\r\ninstance, we find them useful. They share, and in sharing betray, the\r\ngeneral shift of the spectrum. This aspect of Doppler's principle was\r\nadverted to by Fizeau in 1848,[628] and the first tangible results in\r\nthe estimation of movements of approach and recession between the earth\r\nand the stars, were communicated by Sir William Huggins to the Royal\r\nSociety, April 23, 1868. Eighteen months later, Zöllner devised his\r\n\"reversion-spectroscope\"[629] for doubling the measurable effects of\r\nline-displacements; aided by which ingenious instrument, and following a\r\nsuggestion of its inventor, Professor H. C. Vogel succeeded at Bothkamp,\r\nJune 9, 1871,[630] in detecting effects of that nature due to the solar\r\nrotation. This application constitutes at once the test and the triumph\r\nof the method.[631]\r\n\r\nThe eastern edge of the sun is continually moving towards us with an\r\nequatorial speed of about a mile and a quarter per second, the western\r\nedge retreating at the same rate. The displacements--towards the violet\r\non the east, towards the red on the west--corresponding to this velocity\r\nare very small; so small that it seems hardly credible that they should\r\nhave been laid bare to perception. They amount to but 1/150th part of\r\nthe interval between the two constituents of the D-line of sodium; and\r\nthe D-line of sodium itself can be separated into a pair only by a\r\npowerful spectroscope. Nevertheless, Professor Young[632] was able to\r\nshow quite satisfactorily, in 1876, not only deviations in the solar\r\nlines from their proper places indicating a velocity of rotation (1·42\r\nmiles per second) slightly in excess of that given by observations of\r\nspots, but the exemption of terrestrial lines (those produced by\r\nabsorption in the earth's atmosphere) from the general push upwards or\r\ndownwards. Shortly afterwards, Professor Langley, then director of the\r\nAllegheny Observatory, having devised a means of comparing with great\r\naccuracy light from different portions of the sun's disc, found that\r\nwhile the obscure rays in two juxtaposed spectra derived from the solar\r\npoles were absolutely continuous, no sooner was the instrument rotated\r\nthrough 90°, so as to bring its luminous supplies from opposite\r\nextremities of the equator, than the same rays became perceptibly\r\n\"notched.\" The telluric lines, meanwhile, remained unaffected, so as to\r\nbe \"virtually mapped\" by the process.[633] This rapid and unfailing mode\r\nof distinction was used by Cornu with perfect ease during his\r\ninvestigation of atmospheric absorption near Loiret in August and\r\nSeptember, 1883.[634]\r\n\r\nA beautiful experiment of the same kind was performed by M. Thollon, of\r\nM. Bischoffsheim's observatory at Nice, in the summer of 1880.[635] He\r\nconfined his attention to one delicately defined group of four lines in\r\nthe orange, of which the inner pair are solar (iron) and the outer\r\nterrestrial. At the centre of the sun the intervals separating them were\r\nsensibly equal; but when the light was taken alternately from the right\r\nand left limbs, a relative shift in alternate directions of the solar,\r\ntowards and from the stationary telluric rays became apparent. A\r\nparallel observation was made at Dunecht, December 14, 1883, when it was\r\nnoticed that a strong iron-line in the yellow part of the solar spectrum\r\nis permanently double on the sun's eastern, but single on his western\r\nlimb;[636] opposite motion-displacements bringing about this curious\r\neffect of coincidence with, and separation from, an adjacent stationary\r\nline of our own atmosphere's production, according as the spectrum is\r\nderived from the retreating or advancing margin of the solar globe.\r\nStatements of fact so precise and authoritative amount to a\r\ndemonstration that results of this kind are worthy of confidence; and\r\nthey already occupy an important place among astronomical data.\r\n\r\nThe subtle method of which they served to assure the validity was\r\nemployed in 1887-9 by M. Dunér to test and extend Carrington's and\r\nSpörer's conclusions as to the anomalous nature of the sun's axial\r\nmovement.[637] His observations for the purpose, made with a fine\r\ndiffraction-spectroscope, just then mounted at the observatory of\r\nUpsala, were published in 1891.[638] Their upshot was to confirm and\r\nwiden the law of retardation with increasing latitude derived from the\r\nprogressive motions of spots. Determinations made within 15° of the\r\npole, consequently far beyond the region of spots, gave a\r\nrotation-period of 38-1/2, that of the equatorial belt being of 25-1/2\r\ndays. Spots near the equator indeed complete their rounds in a period\r\nshorter by at least half a day; and proportionate differences were found\r\nto exist elsewhere in corresponding latitudes; but Dunér's observations,\r\nit must be remembered, apply to a distinct part of the complex solar\r\nmachine from the disturbed photospheric surface. It is amply possible\r\nthat the absorptive strata producing the Fraunhofer lines, significant,\r\nby their varying displacements at either limb, of the inferred varying\r\nrates of rotation, may gyrate more slowly than the spot-generating\r\nlevel. Moreover, faculæ appear to move at a quicker pace than\r\neither;[639] so that we have, for three solar formations, three\r\ndifferent periods of average rotation, the shortest of which belongs to\r\nthe faculæ, one of intermediate length to the spots, and the most\r\nprotracted to the reversing layer. All, however, agree in lengthening\r\nprogressively from the equator towards the poles. Professor Holden aptly\r\ncompared the sun to \"a vast whirlpool where the velocities of rotation\r\ndepend not only on the situation of the rotating masses as to latitude,\r\nbut also as to depth beneath the exterior surface.\"[640]\r\n\r\nSir Norman Lockyer[641] promptly perceived the applicability of the\r\nsurprising discovery of line-shiftings through end-on motion to the\r\nstudy of prominences, the discontinuous light of which affords precisely\r\nthe same means of detecting movement without seeming change of place, as\r\ndo lines of absorption in a continuous spectrum. Indeed, his\r\nobservations at the sun's edge almost compelled recourse to an\r\nexplanation made available just when the need of it began to be felt. He\r\nsaw bright lines, not merely pushed aside from their normal places by a\r\nbarely perceptible amount, but bent, torn, broken, as if by the stress\r\nof some tremendous violence. These remarkable appearances were quite\r\nsimply interpreted as the effects of movements varying in amount and\r\ndirection in the different parts of the extensive mass of incandescent\r\nvapours falling within a single field of view. Very commonly they are of\r\na cyclonic character. The opposite distortions of the same coloured rays\r\nbetray the fury of \"counter-gales\" rushing along at the rate of 120\r\nmiles a second; while their undisturbed sections prove the persistence\r\nof a \"heart of peace\" in the midst of that unimaginable fiery whirlwind.\r\nVelocities up to 250 _miles a second_, or 15,000 times that of an\r\nexpress train at the top of its speed, were thus observed by Young\r\nduring his trip to Mount Sherman, August 2, 1872; and these were\r\nactually doubled in an extraordinary outburst observed by Father Jules\r\nFényi, on June 17, 1891, at the Haynald Observatory in Hungary, as well\r\nas by M. Trouvelot at Meudon.[642]\r\n\r\nMotions ascertainable in this way near the limb are, of course,\r\nhorizontal as regards the sun's surface; the analogies they present\r\nmight, accordingly, be styled _meteorological_ rather than _volcanic_.\r\nBut vertical displacements on a scale no less stupendous can also be\r\nshown to exist. Observations of the spectra of spots centrally situated\r\n(where motions in the line of sight are vertical) disclose the progress\r\nof violent uprushes and downrushes of ignited gases, for the most part\r\nin the penumbral or outlying districts. They appear to be occasioned by\r\nfitful and irregular disturbances, and have none of the systematic\r\nquality which would be required for the elucidation of sun-spot\r\ntheories. Indeed, they almost certainly take place at a great height\r\nabove the actual openings in the photosphere.\r\n\r\nAs to vertical motions above the limb, on the other hand, we have direct\r\nvisual evidence of a truly amazing kind. The projected glowing matter\r\nhas, by the aid of the spectroscope, been watched in its ascent. On\r\nSeptember 7, 1871, Young examined at noon a vast hydrogen cloud 100,000\r\nmiles long, as it showed to the eye, and 54,000 high. It floated\r\ntranquilly above the chromosphere at an elevation of some 15,000 miles,\r\nand was connected with it by three or four upright columns, presenting\r\nthe not uncommon aspect compared by Lockyer to that of a grove of\r\nbanyans. Called away for a few minutes at 12.30, on returning at 12.55\r\nthe observer found--\r\n\r\n\"That in the meantime the whole thing had been literally blown to shreds\r\nby some inconceivable uprush from beneath. In place of the quiet cloud I\r\nhad left, the air, if I may use the expression, was filled with flying\r\ndébris--a mass of detached, vertical, fusiform filaments, each from 10\"\r\nto 30\" long by 2\" or 3\" wide,[643] brighter and closer together where\r\nthe pillars had formerly stood, and rapidly ascending. They rose, with a\r\nvelocity estimated at 166 miles a second, to fully 200,000 miles above\r\nthe sun's surface, then gradually faded away like a dissolving cloud,\r\nand at 1.15 only a few filmy wisps, with some brighter streamers low\r\ndown near the photosphere, remained to mark the place.\"[644]\r\n\r\nA velocity of projection of _at least_ 500 miles per second was, by\r\nProctor's[645] calculation, required to account for this extraordinary\r\ndisplay, to which the earth immediately responded by a magnetic\r\ndisturbance, and a fine aurora. It has proved by no means an isolated\r\noccurrence. Young saw its main features repeated, October 7, 1881,[646]\r\non a still vaster scale; for the exploded prominence attained, this\r\ntime, an altitude of 350,000 miles--the highest yet chronicled. Lockyer,\r\nmoreover, has seen a prominence 40,000 miles high shattered in ten\r\nminutes; while uprushes have been witnessed by Respighi, of which the\r\ninitial velocities were judged by him to be 400 or 500 miles a second.\r\nWhen it is remembered that a body starting from the sun's surface at the\r\nrate of 383 miles a second would, if it encountered no resistance,\r\nescape for ever from his control, it is obvious that we have, in the\r\nenormous forces of eruption or repulsion manifested in the outbursts\r\njust described, the means of accounting for the vast diffusion of matter\r\nin the solar neighbourhood. Nor is it possible to explain them away, as\r\nCornu,[647] Faye,[648] and others have sought to do, by substituting for\r\nthe rush of matter in motion, progressive illumination through electric\r\ndischarges, chemical processes,[649] or even through the mere reheating\r\nof gases cooled by expansion.[650] All the appearances are against such\r\nevasions of the difficulty presented by velocities stigmatised as\r\n\"fabulous\" and \"improbable,\" but which, there is the strongest reason to\r\nbelieve, really exist.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of December, 1878, Sir Norman Lockyer formally expounded\r\nbefore the Royal Society his hypothesis of the compound nature of the\r\n\"chemical elements.\"[651] An hypothesis, it is true, over and over again\r\npropounded from the simply terrestrial point of view. What was novel was\r\nthe supra-terrestrial evidence adduced in its support; and even this had\r\nbeen, in a general and speculative way, anticipated by Professor F. W.\r\nClarke of Washington.[652] Lockyer had been led to his conclusion along\r\nseveral converging lines of research. In a letter to M. Dumas, dated\r\nDecember 3, 1873, he had sketched out the successive stages of\r\n\"celestial dissociation\" which he conceived to be represented in the sun\r\nand stars. The absence from the solar spectrum of metalloidal absorption\r\nhe explained by the separation, in the fierce solar furnace, of such\r\nsubstances as oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, and chlorine, into simpler\r\nconstituents possessing unknown spectra; while metals were at that time\r\nstill admitted to be capable of existing there in a state of integrity.\r\nThree years later he shifted his position onward. He announced, as the\r\nresult of a comparative study of the Fraunhofer and electric-arc spectra\r\nof calcium, that the \"molecular grouping\" of that metal, which at low\r\ntemperatures gives a spectrum with its chief line in the blue, is nearly\r\nbroken up in the sun into another or others with lines in the\r\nviolet.[653] This came to be regarded by him as \"a truly typical\r\ncase.\"[654]\r\n\r\nDuring four years (1875-78 inclusive) this diligent observer was engaged\r\nin mapping a section of the more refrangible part of the solar spectrum\r\n(wave-lengths 3,800-4,000) on a scale of magnitude such that, if\r\ncompleted down to the infra-red, its length would have been about _half\r\na furlong_. The attendant laborious investigation, by the aid of\r\nphotography, of metallic spectra, seemed to indicate the existence of\r\nwhat he called \"basic lines.\" These held their ground persistently in\r\nthe spectra of two or more metals after all possible \"impurities\" had\r\nbeen eliminated, and were therefore held to attest the presence of a\r\ncommon substratum of matter in a simpler state of aggregation than any\r\nwith which we are ordinarily acquainted.\r\n\r\nLater inquiries have shown, however, that between the spectral lines of\r\ndifferent substances there are probably no _absolute_ coincidences.\r\n\"Basic\" lines are really formed of doublets or triplets merged together\r\nby insufficient dispersion. Of Thalèn's original list of seventy rays\r\ncommon to several spectra,[655] very few resisted Thollon's and Young's\r\npowerful spectroscopes; and the process of resolution was completed by\r\nRowland. Thus the argument from community of lines to community of\r\nsubstance has virtually collapsed. It was replaced by one founded on\r\ncertain periodical changes on the spectra of sun-spots. They emerged\r\nfrom a series of observations begun at South Kensington under Sir Norman\r\nLockyer's direction in 1879, and continued for fifteen years.[656]\r\n\r\nThe principle of the method employed is this. The whole range of\r\nFraunhofer lines is visible when the light from a spot is examined with\r\nthe spectroscope; but relatively few are widened. Now these widened\r\nlines alone constitute (presumably) the true spot-spectrum; they, and\r\nthey alone, tell what kinds of vapour are thrust down into the strange\r\ndusky pit of the nucleus, the unaffected lines taking their accustomed\r\norigin from the over-lying strata of the normal solar atmosphere. Here\r\nthen we have the criterion that was wanted--the means of distinguishing,\r\nspectroscopically and chemically, between the cavity and the absorbing\r\nlayers piled up above it. By its persistent employment some marked\r\npeculiarities have been brought out, such as the unfamiliar character of\r\nnumerous lines in spot-spectra, especially at epochs of disturbance; and\r\nthe strange _individuality_ in the behaviour of every one of these\r\ndarkened and distended rays. Each seems to act on its own account; it\r\ncomports itself as if it were the sole representative of the substance\r\nemitting it; its appearance is unconditioned by that of any of its\r\nterrestrial companions in the same spectrum.\r\n\r\nThe most curious fact, however, elicited by these inquiries was that of\r\nthe attendance of chemical vicissitudes upon the advance of the sun-spot\r\nperiod. As the maximum approached, unknown replaced known components of\r\nthe spot-spectra in a most pronounced and unmistakable way.[657] It\r\nseemed as if the vapours emitting lines of iron, titanium, nickel, etc.,\r\nhad ceased to exist as such, and their room been taken by others, total\r\nstrangers in terrestrial laboratories. These were held by Lockyer to be\r\nsimply the finer constituents of their predecessors, dissociation having\r\nbeen effected by the higher temperature ensuing upon increased solar\r\nactivity. But Father Cortie's supplementary investigations at\r\nStonyhurst[658] modified, while they in the main substantiated, the\r\nSouth Kensington results. They showed that the substitution of unknown\r\nfor known lines characterizes disturbed spots, at all stages of the\r\nsolar cycle, so that no systematic course of chemical change can be said\r\nto affect the sun as a whole. They showed further[659]--from evidence\r\nindependent of that obtained by Young in 1892[660]--the remarkable\r\nconspicuousness in spot-spectra of vanadium lines excessively faint in\r\nthe Fraunhofer spectrum. Lockyer's \"unknown lines\" may probably thus be\r\naccounted for. They represent absorption, not by new, but by scarce\r\nelements, especially, Father Cortie thinks, those with atomic weights of\r\nabout 50. The circumstance of their development in solar commotions,\r\nlargely to the exclusion of iron, is none the less curious; but it\r\ncannot be explained by any process of dissociation.\r\n\r\nThe theory has, however, to be considered under still another aspect. It\r\nfrequently happens that the contortions or displacements due to motion\r\nare seen to affect a single line belonging to a particular substance,\r\nwhile the other lines of _that same substance_ remain imperturbable.\r\nNow, how is this most singular fact, which seems at first sight to imply\r\nthat a body may be at rest and in motion at one and the same instant, to\r\nbe accounted for? It is accounted for, on the present hypothesis, easily\r\nenough, by supposing that the rays thus discrepant in their testimony,\r\ndo _not_ belong to one kind of matter, but to several, combined at\r\nordinary temperatures to form a body in appearance \"elementary.\" Of\r\nthese different vapours, one or more may of course be rushing rapidly\r\ntowards or from the observer, while the others remain still; and since\r\nthe line of sight across the average prominence-region penetrates, at\r\nthe sun's edge, a depth of about 300,000 miles,[661] all the\r\nincandescent materials separately occurring along which line are\r\nprojected into a single \"flame\" or \"cloud,\" it will be perceived that\r\nthere is ample room for diversities of behaviour.\r\n\r\nThe alternative mode of escape from the perplexity consists in assuming\r\nthat the vapour in motion is rendered luminous under conditions which\r\nreduce its spectrum to a few rays, the unaffected lines being derived\r\nfrom a totally distinct mass of the same substance shining with its\r\nordinary emissions.[662] Thus, calcium can be rendered virtually\r\nmonochromatic by attenuation, and analogous cases are not rare.\r\n\r\nSir Norman Lockyer only asks us to believe that effects which follow\r\ncertain causes on the earth are carried a stage further in the sun,\r\nwhere the same causes must be vastly intensified. We find that the\r\nbodies we call \"compound\" split asunder at fixed degrees of heat\r\n_within_ the range of our resources. Why should we hesitate to admit\r\nthat the bodies we call \"simple\" do likewise at degrees of heat\r\n_without_ the range of our resources? The term \"element\" simply\r\nexpresses terrestrial incapability of reduction. That, in celestial\r\nlaboratories, the means and their effect here absent should be present,\r\nwould be an inference challenging, in itself, no expression of\r\nincredulity.\r\n\r\nThere are indeed theoretical objections to it which, though probably not\r\ninsuperable, are unquestionably grave. Our seventy chemical \"elements,\"\r\nfor instance, are placed by the law of specific heats on a separate\r\nfooting from their known compounds. We are not, it is true, compelled by\r\nit to believe their atoms to be really and absolutely such--to contain,\r\nthat is, the \"irreducible minimum\" of material substance; but we do\r\ncertainly gather from it that they are composed on a different principle\r\nfrom the salts and oxides made and unmade at pleasure by chemists. Then\r\nthe multiplication of the species of matter with which Lockyer's results\r\nmenace us, is at first sight startling. They may lead, we are told, to\r\neventual unification, but the prospect appears remote. Their only\r\nobvious outcome is the disruption into several constituents of each\r\nterrestrial \"element.\" The components of iron alone should be counted by\r\nthe dozen. And there are other metals, such as cerium, which, giving a\r\nstill more complex spectrum, would doubtless be still more numerously\r\nresolved. Sir Norman Lockyer interprets the observed phenomena as\r\nindicating the successive combinations, in varying proportions, of a\r\nvery few original ingredients;[663] but no definite sign of their\r\nexistence is perceptible; \"protyle\" seems likely long to evade\r\nrecognition; and the only intelligible underlying principle for the\r\nreasonings employed--that of \"one line, one element\"--implies a throng\r\nbeyond counting of formative material units.\r\n\r\nThus, added complexity is substituted for that fundamental unity of\r\nmatter which has long formed the dream of speculators. And it is\r\nextremely remarkable that Sir William Crookes, working along totally\r\ndifferent lines, has been led to analogous conclusions. To take only one\r\nexample. As the outcome of extremely delicate operations of sifting and\r\ntesting carried on for years, he finds that the metal yttrium splits up\r\ninto five, if not eight constituents.[664] Evidently, old notions are\r\ndoomed, nor are any preconceived ones likely to take their place. It\r\nwould seem, on the contrary, as if their complete reconstruction were at\r\nhand. Subversive facts are steadily accumulating; the revolutionary\r\nideas springing from them tend, if we interpret them aright, towards the\r\nsubstitution of electrical for chemical theories of matter. Dissociation\r\nby the brute force of heat is already nearly superseded, in the thoughts\r\nof physicists, by the more delicate process of \"ionisation.\" Precisely\r\nwhat this implies and involves we do not know; but the symptoms of its\r\noccurrence are probably altogether different from those gathered by Sir\r\nNorman Lockyer from the collation of celestial spectra.\r\n\r\nA. J. Ångström of Upsala takes rank after Kirchhoff as a subordinate\r\nfounder, so to speak, of solar spectroscopy. His great map of the\r\n\"normal\" solar spectrum[665] was published in 1868, two years before he\r\ndied. Robert Thalèn was his coadjutor in its execution, and the immense\r\nlabour which it cost was amply repaid by its eminent and lasting\r\nusefulness. For more than a score of years it held its ground as the\r\nuniversal standard of reference in all spectroscopic inquiries within\r\nthe range of the _visible_ emanations. Those that are invisible by\r\nreason of the quickness of their vibrations were mapped by Dr. Henry\r\nDraper, of New York, in 1873, and with superior accuracy by M. Cornu in\r\n1881. The infra-red part of the spectrum, investigated by Langley,\r\nAbney, and Knut Ångström, reaches perhaps no definite end. The\r\nradiations oscillating too slowly to affect the eye as light may pass by\r\ninsensible gradations into the long Hertzian waves of electricity.[666]\r\n\r\nProfessor Rowland's photographic map of the solar spectrum, published in\r\n1886, and in a second enlarged edition in 1889, opened fresh\r\npossibilities for its study, from far down in the red to high up in the\r\nultra-violet, and the accompanying scale of absolute wave-lengths[667]\r\nhas been, with trifling modifications, universally adopted. His new\r\ntable of standard solar lines was published in 1893.[668] Through his\r\nwork, indeed, knowledge of the solar spectrum so far outstripped\r\nknowledge of terrestrial spectra, that the recognition of their common\r\nconstituents was hampered by intolerable uncertainties. Thousands of the\r\nsolar lines charted with minute precision remained unidentified for want\r\nof a corresponding precision in the registration of metallic lines.\r\nRowland himself, however, undertook to provide a remedy. Aided by Lewis\r\nE. Jewell, he redetermined, at the Johns Hopkins University, the\r\nwave-lengths of about 16,000 solar lines,[669] photographing for\r\ncomparison with them the spectra of all the known chemical elements\r\nexcept gallium, of which he could procure no specimen. The labour of\r\ncollation was well advanced when he died at the age of fifty-two, April\r\n16, 1901. Investigations of metallic arc-spectra have also been carried\r\nout with signal success by Hasselberg,[670] Kayser and Runge, O.\r\nLohse,[671] and others.\r\n\r\nAnother condition _sine quâ non_ of progress in this department is the\r\nseparation of true solar lines from those produced by absorption in our\r\nown atmosphere. And here little remains to be done. Thollon's great\r\nAtlas[672] was designed for this purpose of discrimination. Each of its\r\nthirty-three maps exhibits in quadruplicate a subdivision of the solar\r\nspectrum under varied conditions of weather and zenith-distance.\r\nTelluric effects are thus made easily legible, and they account wholly\r\nfor 866, partly for 246, out of a total of 3,200 lines. But the death of\r\nthe artist, April 8, 1887, unfortunately interrupted the half-finished\r\ntask of the last seven years of his life. A most satisfactory record,\r\nmeanwhile, of selective atmospheric action has been supplied by the\r\nexperiments and determinations of Janssen, Cornu and Egoroff, by Dr.\r\nBecker's drawings,[673] and Mr. McClean's photographs of the analysed\r\nlight of the sun at high, low, and medium altitudes; and the autographic\r\npictures obtained by Mr. George Higgs, of Liverpool, of certain\r\nrhythmical groups in the red, emerging with surprising strength near\r\nsunset, excite general and well-deserved admiration.[674] The main\r\ninterest, however, of all these documents resides in the information\r\nafforded by them regarding the chemistry of the sun.\r\n\r\nThe discovery that hydrogen exists in the atmosphere of the sun was made\r\nby Ångström in 1862. His list of solar elements published in that\r\nyear,[675] the result of an investigation separate from, though\r\nconducted on the same principle as Kirchhoff's, included the substance\r\nwhich we now know to be predominant among them. Dr. Plücker of Bonn had\r\nidentified in 1859 the Fraunhofer line F with the green ray of hydrogen,\r\nbut drew no inference from his observation. The agreement was verified\r\nby Ångström; two further coincidences were established; and in 1866 a\r\nfourth hydrogen line in the extreme violet (named _h_) was detected in\r\nthe solar spectrum. With Thalèn, he besides added manganese, titanium,\r\nand cobalt to the constituents of the sun enumerated by Kirchhoff, and\r\nraised the number of identical rays in the solar and terrestrial spectra\r\nof iron to no less than 460.[676]\r\n\r\nThus, when Sir Norman Lockyer entered on that branch of inquiry in 1872,\r\nfourteen substances were recognised as common to the earth and sun.\r\nEarly in 1878 he was able to increase the list provisionally to\r\nthirty-three,[677] all except hydrogen metals. This rapid success was\r\ndue to his adoption of the test of _length_ in lieu of that of\r\n_strength_ in the comparison of lines. He measured their relative\r\nsignificance, in other words, rather by their persistence through a wide\r\nrange of temperature, than by their brilliancy at any one temperature.\r\nThe distinction was easily drawn. Photographs of the electric arc, in\r\nwhich any given metal had been volatilised, showed some of the rays\r\nemitted by it stretching across the axis of the light to a considerable\r\ndistance on either side, while many others clung more or less closely to\r\nits central hottest core. The former \"long lines,\" regarded as certainly\r\nrepresentative, were those primarily sought in the solar spectrum; while\r\nthe attendant \"short lines,\" often, in point of fact, due to foreign\r\nadmixtures, were set aside as likely to be misleading.[678] The\r\ncriterion is a valuable one, and its employment has greatly helped to\r\nquicken the progress of solar chemistry.\r\n\r\nCarbon was the first non-metallic element discovered in the sun. Messrs.\r\nTrowbridge and Hutchins of Harvard College concluded in 1887,[679] on\r\nthe ground of certain spectral coincidences, that this protean substance\r\nis vaporised in the solar atmosphere at a temperature approximately that\r\nof the voltaic arc. Partial evidence to the same effect had earlier been\r\nalleged by Lockyer, as well as by Liveing and Dewar; and the case was\r\nrendered tolerably complete by photographs taken by Kayser and Runge in\r\n1889.[680] It was by Professor Rowland shown to be irresistible. Two\r\nhundred carbon-lines were, through his comparisons, sifted out from\r\nsunlight, and it contains others significant of the presence of\r\nsilicon--a related substance, and one as important to rock-building on\r\nthe earth, as carbon is to the maintenance of life. The general result\r\nof Rowland's labours was the establishment among solar materials, not\r\nonly of these two out of the fourteen metalloids, or non-metallic\r\nsubstances, but of thirty-three metals, including silver and tin. Gold,\r\nmercury, bismuth, antimony, and arsenic were discarded from the\r\ncatalogue; platinum and uranium, with six other metals, remained\r\ndoubtful; while iron was recorded as crowding the spectrum with over two\r\nthousand obscure rays.[681] Gallium-absorption was detected in it by\r\nHartley and Ramage in 1889.[682]\r\n\r\nDr. Henry Draper[683] announced, in 1877, his imagined discovery, in the\r\nsolar spectrum, of eighteen especially brilliant spaces corresponding to\r\noxygen-emissions. But the agreement proved, when put to the test of very\r\nhigh dispersion, to be wholly illusory.[684] Nor has it yet been found\r\npossible to identify, in analysed sunlight, any significant _bright_\r\nbeams.[685]\r\n\r\nThe book of solar chemistry must be read in characters exclusively of\r\nabsorption. Nevertheless, the whole truth is unlikely to be written\r\nthere. That a substance displays none of its distinctive beams in the\r\nspectrum of the sun or of a star, affords scarcely a presumption against\r\nits presence. For it may be situated below the level where absorption\r\noccurs, or under a pressure such as to efface lines by widening and\r\nweakening them; it may be at a temperature so high that it gives out\r\nmore light than it takes up, and yet its incandescence may be masked by\r\nthe absorption of other bodies; finally, it may just balance absorption\r\nby emission, with the result of complete spectral neutrality. An\r\ninstructive example is that of the chromospheric element helium. Father\r\nSecchi remarked in 1868[686] that there is no dark line in the solar\r\nspectrum matching its light; and his observation has been fully\r\nconfirmed.[687] Helium-absorption is, however, occasionally noticed in\r\nthe penumbræ of spots.[688]\r\n\r\nOur terrestrial vital element might then easily subsist unrecognisably\r\nin the sun. The inner organisation of the oxygen molecule is a\r\nconsiderably _plastic_ one. It is readily modified by heat, and these\r\nmodifications are reflected in its varying modes of radiating light. Dr.\r\nSchuster enumerated in 1879[689] four distinct oxygen spectra,\r\ncorresponding to various stages of temperature, or phases of electrical\r\nexcitement; and a fifth has been added by M. Egoroff's discovery in\r\n1883[690] that certain well-known groups of dark lines in the red end of\r\nthe solar spectrum (Fraunhofer's A and B) are due to absorption by the\r\ncool oxygen of our air. These persist down to the lowest temperatures,\r\nand even survive a change of state. They are produced essentially the\r\nsame by liquid, as by aërial oxygen.[691]\r\n\r\nIt seemed, however, possible to M. Janssen that these bands owned a\r\njoint solar and terrestrial origin. Oxygen in a fit condition to produce\r\nthem might, he considered, exist in the outer atmosphere of the sun; and\r\nhe resolved to decide the point. No one could bring more skill and\r\nexperience to bear upon it than he.[692] By observations on the summit\r\nof the Faulhorn, as well as by direct experiment, he demonstrated,\r\nnearly thirty years ago, the leading part played by water-vapour in\r\ngenerating the atmospheric spectrum; and he had recourse to similar\r\nmeans for appraising the share in it assignable to oxygen. An electric\r\nbeam, transmitted from the Eiffel Tower to Meudon in the summer of 1888,\r\nhaving passed through a weight of oxygen about equal to that piled above\r\nthe surface of the earth, showed the groups A and B just as they appear\r\nin the high-sun spectrum.[693] Atmospheric action is then adequate to\r\nproduce them. But M. Janssen desired to prove, in addition, that they\r\ndiminish proportionately to its amount. His ascent of Mont Blanc[694] in\r\n1890 was undertaken with this object. It was perfectly successful. In\r\nthe solar spectrum, examined from that eminence, oxygen-absorption was\r\nso much enfeebled as to leave no possible doubt of its purely telluric\r\norigin. Under another form, nevertheless, it has been detected as\r\nindubitably solar. A triplet of dark lines low down in the red,\r\nphotographed from the sun by Higgs and McClean, was clearly identified\r\nby Runge and Paschen in 1896[695] with the fundamental group of an\r\noxygen series, first seen by Piazzi Smyth in the spectrum of a\r\nvacuum-tube in 1883.[696] The _pabulum vitæ_ of our earth is then to\r\nsome slight extent effective in arresting transmitted sunlight, and\r\noxygen must be classed as a solar element.\r\n\r\nThe rays of the sun, besides being stopped selectively in our\r\natmosphere, suffer also a marked general absorption. This tells chiefly\r\nupon the shortest wave-lengths; the ultra-violet spectrum is in fact\r\nclosed, as if by the interposition of an opaque screen. Nor does the\r\nscreen appear very sensibly less opaque from an elevation of 10,000\r\nfeet. Dr. Simony's spectral photographs, taken on the Peak of\r\nTeneriffe,[697] extended but slightly further up than M. Cornu's, taken\r\nin the valley of the Loire. Could the veil be withdrawn, some\r\nindications as to the originating temperature of the solar spectrum\r\nmight be gathered from its range, since the proportion of quick\r\nvibrations given out by a glowing body grows with the intensity of its\r\nincandescence. And this brings us to the subject of our next Chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 596: _Phil. Mag._, vol. xlii., p. 380, 1871.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 597: _Astr. Nach._, No. 3,053, _Amer.

His object in making the experiment\r\nwas to ascertain the temperature encountered by the comet of 1680 at its\r\npassage through perihelion. He found it, by multiplying the observed\r\nheating effects of direct sunshine according to the familiar rule of the\r\n\"inverse squares of the distances,\" to be about 2,000 times that of\r\nred-hot iron.[698]\r\n\r\nDeterminations of the sun's thermal power, made with some scientific\r\nexactness, date, however, from 1837. A few days previous to the\r\nbeginning of that year, Herschel began observing at the Cape of Good\r\nHope with an \"actinometer,\" and obtained results agreeing quite\r\nsatisfactorily with those derived by Pouillet from experiments made in\r\nFrance some months later with a \"pyrheliometer.\"[699] Pouillet found\r\nthat the vertical rays of the sun falling on each square centimetre of\r\nthe earth's surface are competent (apart from atmospheric absorption) to\r\nraise the temperature of 1·7633 grammes of water one degree Centigrade\r\nper minute. This number (1·7633) he called the \"solar constant\"; and the\r\nunit of heat chosen is known as the \"calorie.\" Hence it was computed\r\nthat the total amount of solar heat received during a year would suffice\r\nto melt a layer of ice covering the entire earth to a depth of 30·89\r\nmetres, or 100 feet; while the heat emitted would melt, at the sun's\r\nsurface, a stratum 11·80 metres thick each minute. A careful series of\r\nobservations showed that nearly half the heat incident upon our\r\natmosphere is stopped in its passage through it.\r\n\r\nHerschel got somewhat larger figures, though he assigned only a third as\r\nthe spoil of the air. Taking a mean between his own and Pouillet's, he\r\ncalculated that the ordinary expenditure of the sun per minute would\r\nhave power to melt a cylinder of ice 184 feet in diameter, reaching from\r\nhis surface to that of Alpha Centauri; or, putting it otherwise,\r\nthat an ice-rod 45·3 miles across, continually darted into the sun with\r\nthe velocity of light, would scarcely consume, in dissolving, the\r\nthermal supplies now poured abroad into space.[700] It is nearly certain\r\nthat this estimate should be increased by about two-thirds in order to\r\nbring it up to the truth.\r\n\r\nNothing would, at first sight, appear simpler than to pass from a\r\nknowledge of solar emission--a strictly measurable quantity--to a\r\nknowledge of the solar temperature; this being defined as the\r\ntemperature to which a surface thickly coated with lamp-black (that is,\r\nof standard radiating power) should be raised to enable it to send us,\r\nfrom the sun's distance, the amount of heat actually received from the\r\nsun. Sir John Herschel showed that heat-rays at the sun's surface must\r\nbe 92,000 times as dense as when they reach the earth; but it by no\r\nmeans follows that either the surface emitting, or a body absorbing\r\nthose heat-rays must be 92,000 times hotter than a body exposed here to\r\nthe full power of the sun. The reason is, that the rate of\r\nemission--consequently the rate of absorption, which is its\r\ncorrelative--increases very much faster than the temperature. In other\r\nwords, a body radiates or cools at a continually accelerated pace as it\r\nbecomes more and more intensely heated above its surroundings.\r\n\r\nNewton, however, took it for granted that radiation and temperature\r\nadvance _pari passu_--that you have only to ascertain the quantity of\r\nheat received from, and the distance of a remote body in order to know\r\nhow hot it is.[701] And the validity of this principle, known as\r\n\"Newton's Law\" of cooling, was never questioned until De la Roche\r\npointed out, in 1812,[702] that it was approximately true only over a\r\nlow range of temperature; while five years later, Dulong and Petit\r\ngeneralised experimental results into the rule, that while temperature\r\ngrows by arithmetical, radiation increases by geometrical\r\nprogression.[703] Adopting this formula, Pouillet derived from his\r\nobservations on solar heat a solar temperature of somewhere between\r\n1,461° and 1,761° C. Now, the higher of these points--which is nearly\r\nthat of melting platinum--is undoubtedly surpassed at the focus of\r\ncertain burning-glasses which have been constructed of such power as\r\nvirtually to bring objects placed there within a quarter of a million of\r\nmiles of the photosphere. In the rays thus concentrated, platinum and\r\ndiamond become rapidly vaporised, notwithstanding the great loss of heat\r\nby absorption, first in passing through the air, and again in traversing\r\nthe lens. Pouillet's maximum is then manifestly too low, since it\r\ninvolves the absurdity of supposing a radiating mass capable of heating\r\na distant body more than it is itself heated.\r\n\r\nLess demonstrably, but scarcely less surely, Mr. J. J. Waterston, who\r\nattacked the problem in 1860, erred in the opposite direction. Working\r\nup, on Newton's principle, data collected by himself in India and at\r\nEdinburgh, he got for the \"potential temperature\" of the sun 12,880,000°\r\nFahr.,[704] equivalent to 7,156,000° C. The phrase _potential\r\ntemperature_ (for which Violle substituted, in 1876, _effective\r\ntemperature_) was designed to express the accumulation in a single\r\nsurface, postulated for the sake of simplicity, of the radiations not\r\nimprobably received from a multitude of separate solar layers\r\nreinforcing each other; and might thus (it was explained) be\r\nconsiderably higher than the _actual_ temperature of any one stratum.\r\n\r\nAt Rome, in 1861, Father Secchi repeated Waterston's experiments, and\r\nreaffirmed his conclusion;[705] while Soret's observations, made on the\r\nsummit of Mont Blanc in 1867,[706] furnished him with materials for a\r\nfresh and even higher estimate of ten million degrees Centigrade.[707]\r\nYet from the very same data, substituting Dulong and Petit's for\r\nNewton's law, Vicaire deduced in 1872 a _provisional_ solar temperature\r\nof 1,398°.[708] This is below that at which iron melts, and we know that\r\niron-vapour exists high up in the sun's atmosphere. The matter was taken\r\ninto consideration on the other side of the Atlantic by Ericsson in\r\n1871. He attempted to re-establish the shaken credit of Newton's\r\nprinciple, and arrived, by its means, at a temperature of 4,000,000°\r\nFahrenheit.[709] Subsequently, an \"underrated computation,\" based upon\r\nobservation of the quantity of heat received by his \"sun motor,\" gave\r\nhim 3,000,000°. And the result, as he insisted, followed inevitably from\r\nthe principle that the temperature produced by radiant heat is\r\nproportional to its density, or inversely as its diffusion.[710] The\r\nprinciple, however, is demonstrably unsound.\r\n\r\nIn 1876 the sun's temperature was proposed as the subject of a prize by\r\nthe Paris Academy of Sciences; but although the essay of M. Jules Violle\r\nwas crowned, the problem was declared to remain unsolved. Violle (who\r\nadhered to Dulong and Petit's formula) arrived at an _effective_\r\ntemperature of 1,500° C., but considered that it might _actually_ reach\r\n2,500° C., if the emissive power of the photospheric clouds fell far\r\nshort (as seemed probable) of the lamp-black standard.[711] Experiments\r\nmade in April and May, 1881, giving a somewhat higher result, he raised\r\nthis figure to 3,000° C.[712]\r\n\r\nAppraisements so outrageously discordant as those of Waterston, Secchi,\r\nand Ericsson on the one hand, and those of the French _savants_ on the\r\nother, served only to show that all were based upon a vicious principle.\r\nProfessor F. Rosetti,[713] accordingly, of the Paduan University, at\r\nlast perceived the necessity for getting out of the groove of \"laws\"\r\nplainly in contradiction with facts. The temperature, for instance, of\r\nthe oxy-hydrogen flame was fixed by Bunsen at 2,800° C.--an estimate\r\ncertainly not very far from the truth. But if the two systems of\r\nmeasurement applied to the sun be used to determine the heat of a solid\r\nbody rendered incandescent in this flame, it comes out, by Newton's mode\r\nof calculation, 45,000° C.; by Dulong and Petit's, 870° C.[714] Both,\r\nthen, are justly discarded, the first as convicted of exaggeration, the\r\nsecond of undervaluation. The formula substituted by Rosetti in 1878 was\r\ntested successfully up to 2,000° C.; but since, like its predecessors,\r\nit was a purely empirical rule, guaranteed by no principle, and hence\r\nnot to be trusted out of sight, it was, like them, liable to break down\r\nat still higher elevations. Radiation by this new prescription increases\r\nas the _square_ of the _absolute_ temperature--that is, of the number of\r\ndegrees counted from the \"absolute zero\" of -273° C. Its employment gave\r\nfor the sun's radiating surface an effective temperature of 20,380° C.\r\n(including a supposed loss of one-half in the solar atmosphere); and\r\nsetting a probable deficiency in emission (as compared with lamp-black)\r\nagainst a probable mutual reinforcement of superposed strata, Professor\r\nRosetti considered \"effective\" as nearly equivalent to \"actual\"\r\ntemperature. A \"law of cooling,\" proposed by M. Stefan at Vienna in\r\n1879,[715] was shown by Boltzmann, many years later, to have a certain\r\ntheoretical validity.[716] It is that emission grows as the fourth power\r\nof absolute temperature. Hence the temperature of the photosphere would\r\nbe proportional to the square root of the square root of its heating\r\neffects at a distance, and appeared, by Stefan's calculations from\r\nViolle's measures of solar radiative intensity, to be just 6,000° C.;\r\nwhile M. H. Le Chatelier[717] derived 7,600° from a formula, conveying\r\nan intricate and unaccountable relation between the temperature of an\r\nincandescent body and the intensity of its red radiations.\r\n\r\nFrom a series of experiments carefully conducted at Daramona, Ireland,\r\nwith a delicate thermal balance, of the kind invented by Boys and\r\ndesignated a \"radio-micrometer,\" Messrs. Wilson and Gray arrived in\r\n1893, with the aid of Stefan's Law, at a photospheric temperature of\r\n7,400° C.,[718] reduced by the first-named investigator in 1901 to\r\n6,590°.[719] Dr. Paschen, of Hanover, on the other hand, ascribed to the\r\nsun a temperature of 5,000° from comparisons between solar radiative\r\nintensity and that of glowing platinum;[720] while F. W. Very showed in\r\n1895[721] that a minimum value of 20,000° C. for the same datum resulted\r\nfrom Paschen's formula connecting temperature with the position of\r\nmaximum spectral energy.\r\n\r\nA new line of inquiry was struck out by Zöllner in 1870. Instead of\r\ntracking the solar radiations backward with the dubious guide of\r\nempirical formulæ, he investigated their intensity at their source. He\r\nshowed[722] that, taking prominences to be simple effects of the escape\r\nof powerfully compressed gases, it was possible, from the known\r\nmechanical laws of heat and gaseous constitution, to deduce minimum\r\nvalues for the temperatures prevailing in the area of their development.\r\nThese came out 27,700° C. for the strata lying immediately above, and\r\n68,400° C. for the strata lying immediately below the photosphere, the\r\nformer being regarded as the region _into_ which, and the latter as the\r\nregion _from_ which the eruptions took place. In this calculation, no\r\nprominences exceeding 40,000 miles (1·5') in height were included. But\r\nin 1884, G. A. Hirn of Colmar, having regard to the enormous velocities\r\nof projection observed in the interim, fixed two million degrees\r\nCentigrade as the lowest _internal_ temperature by which they could be\r\naccounted for; although admitting the photospheric condensations to be\r\nincompatible with a higher _external_ temperature than 50,000° to\r\n100,000° C.[723]\r\n\r\nThis method of going straight to the sun itself, observing what goes on\r\nthere, and inferring conditions, has much to recommend it; but its\r\nprofitable use demands knowledge we are still very far from possessing.\r\nWe are quite ignorant, for instance, of the actual circumstances\r\nattending the birth of the solar flames. The assumption that they are\r\nnothing but phenomena of elasticity is a purely gratuitous one.\r\nSpectroscopic indications, again, give hope of eventually affording a\r\nfixed point of comparison with terrestrial heat sources; but their\r\ninterpretation is still beset with uncertainties; nor can, indeed, the\r\nexpression of transcendental temperatures in degrees of impossible\r\nthermometers be, at the best, other than a futile attempt to convey\r\nnotions respecting a state of things altogether outside the range of our\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nA more tangible, as well as a less disputable proof of solar radiative\r\nintensity than any mere estimates of temperature, was provided in some\r\nexperiments made by Professor Langley in 1878.[724] Using means of\r\nunquestioned validity, he found the sun's disc to radiate 87 times as\r\nmuch heat, and 5,300 times as much light as an equal area of metal in a\r\nBessemer converter after the air-blast had continued about twenty\r\nminutes. The brilliancy of the incandescent steel, nevertheless, was so\r\nblinding, that melted iron, flowing in a dazzling white-hot stream into\r\nthe crucible, showed \"deep brown by comparison, presenting a contrast\r\nlike that of dark coffee poured into a white cup.\" Its temperature was\r\nestimated (not quite securely)[725] at about 2,000° C.; and no\r\nallowances were made, in computing relative intensities, for atmospheric\r\nravages on sunlight, for the extra impediments to its passage presented\r\nby the smoke-laden air of Pittsburgh, or for the obliquity of its\r\nincidence. Thus, a very large balance of advantage lay on the side of\r\nthe metal.\r\n\r\nA further element of uncertainty in estimating the intrinsic strength of\r\nthe sun's rays has still to be considered. From the time that his disc\r\nfirst began to be studied with the telescope, it was perceived to be\r\nless brilliant near the edges. Lucas Valerius, of the Lyncean Academy,\r\nseems to have been the first to note this fact, which, strangely enough,\r\nwas denied by Galileo in a letter to Prince Cesi of January 25,\r\n1613.[726] Father Scheiner, however, fully admitted it, and devoted some\r\ncolumns of his bulky tome to the attempt to find its appropriate\r\nexplanation.[727] In 1729 Bouguer measured, with much accuracy, the\r\namount of this darkening; and from his data, Laplace, adopting a\r\nprinciple of emission now known to be erroneous, concluded that the sun\r\nloses eleven-twelfths of his light through absorption in his own\r\natmosphere.[728] The real existence of this atmosphere, which is totally\r\ndistinct from the beds of ignited vapours producing the Fraunhofer\r\nlines, is not open to doubt, although its nature is still a matter of\r\nconjecture. The separate effects of its action on luminous, thermal, and\r\nchemical rays were carefully studied by Father Secchi, who in 1870[729]\r\ninferred the total absorption to be 88/100 of all radiations taken\r\ntogether, and added the important observation that the light from the\r\nlimb is no longer white, but reddish-brown. Absorptive effects were thus\r\nseen to be unequally distributed; and they could evidently be studied to\r\nadvantage only by taking the various rays of the spectrum separately,\r\nand finding out how much each had suffered in transmission.\r\n\r\nThis was done by H. C. Vogel in 1877.[730] Using a polarising\r\nphotometer, he found that only 13 per cent. of the violet rays escape at\r\nthe edge of the solar disc, 16 of the blue and green, 25 of the yellow,\r\nand 30 per cent. of the red. Midway between centre and limb, 88·7 of\r\nviolet light and 96·7 of red penetrate the absorbing envelope, the\r\nabolition of which would increase the intensity of the sun's visible\r\nspectrum above two and a half times in the most, and once and a half\r\ntimes in the least refrangible parts. The nucleus of a small spot was\r\nascertained to be of the same luminous intensity as a portion of the\r\nunbroken surface about two and a half minutes from the limb. These\r\nexperiments having been made during a spot-minimum when there is reason\r\nto think that absorption is below its average strength, Vogel suggested\r\ntheir repetition at a time of greater activity. They were extended to\r\nthe heat-rays by Edwin B. Frost. Detailed inquiries made at Potsdam in\r\n1892[731] went to show that, were the sun's atmosphere removed, his\r\nthermal power, as regards ourselves, would be increased 1·7 times. They\r\nestablished, too, the practical uniformity in radiation of all parts of\r\nhis disc. A confirmatory result was obtained about the same time by\r\nWilson and Rambaut, who found that the unveiled sun would be once and a\r\nhalf times hotter than the actual sun.[732]\r\n\r\nProfessor Langley, now of Washington, gave to measures of the kind a\r\nrefinement previously undreamt of. Reliable determinations of the\r\n\"energy\" of the individual spectral rays were, for the first time,\r\nrendered possible by his invention of the \"bolometer\" in 1880.[733] This\r\nexquisitely sensitive instrument affords the means of measuring heat,\r\nnot directly, like the thermopile, but in its effects upon the\r\nconduction of electricity. It represents, in the phrase of the inventor,\r\nthe finger laid upon the throttle-valve of a steam-engine. A minute\r\nforce becomes the modulator of a much greater force, and thus from\r\nimperceptible becomes conspicuous. By locally raising the temperature of\r\nan inconceivably fine strip of platinum serving as the conducting-wire\r\nin a circuit, the flow of electricity is impeded at that point, and the\r\nincluded galvanometer records a disturbance of the electrical flow.\r\nAmounts of heat were thus detected in less than ten seconds, which,\r\nexpended during a thousand years on the melting of a kilogramme of ice,\r\nwould leave a part of the work still undone; and further improvements\r\nrendered this marvellous instrument capable of thrilling to changes of\r\ntemperature falling short of one ten-millionth of a degree\r\nCentigrade.[734]\r\n\r\nThe heat contained in the diffraction spectrum is, with equal\r\ndispersions, barely one-tenth of that in the prismatic spectrum. It had,\r\naccordingly, never previously been found possible to measure it in\r\ndetail--that is, ray by ray. But it is only from the diffraction, or\r\nnormal spectrum that any true idea can be gained as to the real\r\ndistribution of energy among the various constituents, visible and\r\ninvisible, of a sunbeam. The effect of passage through a prism is to\r\ncrowd together the red rays very much more than the blue. To this\r\nprismatic distortion was owing the establishment of a pseudo-maximum of\r\nheat in the infra-red, which disappeared when the natural arrangement by\r\nwave-length was allowed free play. Langley's bolometer has shown that\r\nthe hottest part of the normal spectrum virtually coincides with its\r\nmost luminous part, both lying in the orange, close to the D-line.[735]\r\nThus the last shred of evidence in favour of the threefold division of\r\nsolar radiations vanished, and it became obvious that the varying\r\neffects--thermal, luminous, or chemical--produced by them are due, not\r\nto any distinction of quality in themselves, but to the different\r\nproperties of the substances they impinge upon. They are simply bearers\r\nof energy, conveyed in shorter or longer vibrations; the result in each\r\nseparate case depending upon the capacity of the material particles\r\nmeeting them for taking up those shorter or longer vibrations, and\r\nturning them variously to account in their inner economy.\r\n\r\nA long series of experiments at Allegheny was completed in the summer of\r\n1881 on the crest of Mount Whitney in the Sierra Nevada. Here, at an\r\nelevation of 14,887 feet, in the driest and purest air, perhaps, in the\r\nworld, atmospheric absorptive inroads become less sensible, and the\r\nindications of the bolometer, consequently, surer and stronger. An\r\nenormous expansion was at once given to the invisible region in the\r\nsolar spectrum below the red. Captain Abney had got chemical effects\r\nfrom undulations twelve ten-thousandths of a millimetre in length. These\r\nwere the longest recognised as, or indeed believed, on theoretical\r\ngrounds, to be capable of existing. Professor Langley now got heating\r\neffects from rays of above twice that wave-length, his delicate thread\r\nof platinum groping its way down nearly to thirty ten-thousandths of a\r\nmillimetre, or three \"microns.\" The known extent of the solar spectrum\r\nwas thus at once more than doubled. Its visible portion covers a range\r\nof about one octave; bolometric indications already in 1884 comprised\r\nbetween three and four. The great importance of the newly explored\r\nregion appears from the fact that three-fourths of the entire energy of\r\nsunlight reside in the infra-red, while scarcely more than one-hundredth\r\npart of that amount is found in the better known ultra-violet\r\nspace.[736] These curious facts were reinforced, in 1886,[737] by\r\nfurther particulars learned with the help of rock-salt lenses and\r\nprisms, glass being impervious to very slow, as to very rapid\r\nvibrations. Traces were thus detected of solar heat distributed into\r\nbands of transmission alternating with bands of atmospheric absorption,\r\nfar beyond the measurable limit of 5·3 microns.\r\n\r\nIn 1894, Langley described at the Oxford Meeting of the British\r\nAssociation[738] his new \"bolographic\" researches, in which the\r\nsensitive plate was substituted for the eye in recording deflections of\r\nthe galvanometer responding to variations of invisible heat. Finally, in\r\n1901,[739] he embodied in a splendid map of the infra-red spectrum 740\r\nabsorption-lines of determinate wave-lengths, ranging from 0·76 to 5·3\r\nmicrons. Their chemical origin, indeed, remains almost entirely unknown,\r\nno extensive investigations having yet been undertaken of the slower\r\nvibrations distinctive of particular substances; but there is evidence\r\nthat seven of the nine great bands crossing the \"new spectrum\" (as\r\nLangley calls it)[740] are telluric, and subject to seasonal change.\r\nHere, then, he thought, might eventually be found a sure standing-ground\r\nfor vitally important previsions of famines, droughts, and\r\nbonanza-crops.\r\n\r\nAtmospheric absorption had never before been studied with such precision\r\nas it was by Langley on Mount Whitney. Aided by simultaneous\r\nobservations from Lone Pine, at the foot of the Sierra, he was able to\r\ncalculate the intensity belonging to each ray before entering the\r\nearth's gaseous envelope--in other words, to construct an\r\nextra-atmospheric curve of energy in the spectrum. The result showed\r\nthat the blue end suffered far more than the red, absorption varying\r\ninversely as wave-length. This property of stopping predominantly the\r\nquicker vibrations is shared, as both Vogel and Langley[741] have\r\nconclusively shown, by the solar atmosphere. The effect of this double\r\nabsorption is as if two plates of reddish glass were interposed between\r\nus and the sun, the withdrawal of which would leave his orb, not only\r\nthree or four times more brilliant, but in colour distinctly\r\ngreenish-blue.[742]\r\n\r\nThe fact of the uncovered sun being _blue_ has an important bearing upon\r\nthe question of his temperature, to afford a somewhat more secure answer\r\nto which was the ultimate object of Professor Langley's persevering\r\nresearches; for it is well known that as bodies grow hotter, the\r\nproportionate representation in their spectra of the more refrangible\r\nrays becomes greater. The lowest stage of incandescence is the familiar\r\none of _red_ heat. As it gains intensity, the quicker vibrations come\r\nin, and an optical balance of sensation is established at _white_ heat.\r\nThe final term of _blue_ heat, as we now know, is attained by the\r\nphotosphere. On this ground alone, then, of the large original\r\npreponderance of blue light, we must raise our estimate of solar heat;\r\nand actual measurements show the same upward tendency. Until quite\r\nlately, Pouillet's figure of 1.7 calories per minute per square\r\ncentimetre of terrestrial surface, was the received value for the \"solar\r\nconstant.\" Forbes had, it is true, got 2.85 from observations on the\r\nFaulhorn in 1842;[743] but they failed to obtain the confidence they\r\nmerited. Pouillet's result was not definitely superseded until Violle,\r\nfrom actinometrical measures at the summit and base of Mont Blanc in\r\n1875, computed the intensity of solar radiation at 2.54,[744] and Crova,\r\nabout the same time, at Montpellier, showed it to be above two\r\ncalories.[745] Langley went higher still. Working out the results of the\r\nMount Whitney expedition, he was led to conclude atmospheric absorption\r\nto be fully twice as effective as had hitherto been supposed. Scarcely\r\n60 per cent., in fact, of those solar radiations which strike\r\nperpendicularly through a seemingly translucent sky, were estimated to\r\nattain the sea-level. The rest are reflected, dispersed, or absorbed.\r\nThis discovery involved a large addition to the original supply so\r\nmercilessly cut down in transmission, and the solar constant rose at\r\nonce to three calories. Nor did the rise stop there. M. Savélieff\r\ndeduced for it a value of 3.47 from actinometrical observations made at\r\nKieff in 1890;[746] and Knut Ångström, taking account of the arrestive\r\npower of carbonic acid, inferred enormous atmospheric absorption, and a\r\nsolar constant of four calories.[747] In other words, the sun's heat\r\nreaching the outskirts of our atmosphere is capable of doing without\r\ncessation the work of an engine of four-horse power for each square yard\r\nof the earth's surface. Thus, modern inquiries tend to render more and\r\nmore evident the vastness of the thermal stores contained in the great\r\ncentral reservoir of our system, while bringing into fair agreement the\r\nestimates of its probable temperature. This is in great measure due to\r\nthe acquisition of a workable formula by which to connect temperature\r\nwith radiation. Stefan's rule of a fourth-power relation, if not\r\nactually a law of nature, is a colourable imitation of one; and its\r\nemployment has afforded a practical certainty that the sun's\r\ntemperature, so far as it is definable, neither exceeds 12,000° C., nor\r\nfalls short of 6,500° C.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 698: _Principia_, p. 498 (1st ed.).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 699: _Comptes Rendus_, t. vii., p. 24.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 700: _Results of Astr.

The semi-diameter of the earth's orbit is\r\nour standard measure for the universe. It is the great fundamental datum\r\nof astronomy--the unit of space, any error in the estimation of which is\r\nmultiplied and repeated in a thousand different ways, both in the\r\nplanetary and sidereal systems. Hence its determination was called by\r\nAiry \"the noblest problem in astronomy.\" It is also one of the most\r\ndifficult. The quantities dealt with are so minute that their sure grasp\r\ntasks all the resources of modern science. An observational inaccuracy\r\nwhich would set the moon nearer to, or farther from us than she really\r\nis by one hundred miles, would vitiate an estimate of the sun's distance\r\nto the extent of sixteen million![748] What is needed in order to attain\r\nknowledge of the desired exactness is no less than this: to measure an\r\nangle about equal to that subtended by a halfpenny 2,000 feet from the\r\neye, within a little more than a thousandth part of its value.\r\n\r\nThe angle thus represented is what is called the \"horizontal parallax\"\r\nof the sun. By this amount--the breadth of a halfpenny at 2,000 feet--he\r\nis, to a spectator on the rotating earth, removed at rising and setting\r\nfrom his meridian place in the heavens. Such, in other terms, would be\r\nthe magnitude of the terrestrial radius as viewed from the sun. If we\r\nknew this magnitude with certainty and precision, we should also know\r\nwith certainty and precision--the dimensions of the earth being, as they\r\nare, well ascertained--the distance of the sun. In fact, the one\r\nquantity commonly stands for the other in works treating professedly of\r\nastronomy. But this angle of parallax or apparent displacement cannot be\r\ndirectly measured--cannot even be perceived with the finest instruments.\r\nNot from its smallness. The parallactic shift of the nearest of the\r\nstars as seen from opposite sides of the earth's orbit, is many times\r\nsmaller. But at the sun's limb, and close to the horizon, where the\r\nvisual angle in question opens out to its full extent, atmospheric\r\ntroubles become overwhelming, and altogether swamp the far more minute\r\neffects of parallax.\r\n\r\nThere remain indirect methods. Astronomers are well acquainted with the\r\nproportions which the various planetary orbits bear to each other. They\r\nare so connected, in the manner expressed by Kepler's Third Law, that\r\nthe periods being known, it only needs to find the interval between any\r\ntwo of them in order to infer at once the distances separating them all\r\nfrom one another and from the sun. The plan is given; what we want to\r\ndiscover is the scale upon which it is drawn; so that, if we can get a\r\nreliable measure of the distance of a single planet from the earth, our\r\nproblem is solved.\r\n\r\nNow some of our fellow-travellers in our unending journey round the sun,\r\ncome at times well within the scope of celestial trigonometry. The orbit\r\nof Mars lies at one point not more than thirty-five million miles\r\noutside that of the earth, and when the two bodies happen to arrive\r\ntogether in or near the favourable spot--a conjuncture which occurs\r\nevery fifteen years--the desired opportunity is granted. Mars is then\r\n\"in opposition,\" or on the _opposite_ side of us from the sun, crossing\r\nthe meridian consequently at midnight.[749] It was from an opposition of\r\nMars, observed in 1672 by Richer at Cayenne in concert with Cassini in\r\nParis, that the first scientific estimate of the sun's distance was\r\nderived. It appeared to be nearly eighty-seven millions of miles\r\n(parallax 9·5\"); while Flamsteed deduced 81,700,000 (parallax 10\") from\r\nhis independent observations of the same occurrence--a difference quite\r\ninsignificant at that stage of the inquiry. But Picard's result was just\r\nhalf Flamsteed's (parallax 20\"; distance forty-one million miles); and\r\nLahire considered that we must be separated from the hearth of our\r\nsystem by an interval of _at least_ 136 million miles.[750] So that\r\nuncertainty continued to have an enormous range.\r\n\r\nVenus, on the other hand, comes closest to the earth when she passes\r\nbetween it and the sun. At such times of \"inferior conjunction\" she is,\r\nhowever, still twenty-six million miles, or (in round numbers) 109 times\r\nas distant as the moon. Moreover, she is so immersed in the sun's rays\r\nthat it is only when her path lies across his disc that the requisite\r\nfacilities for measurement are afforded. These \"partial eclipses of the\r\nsun by Venus\" (as Encke termed them) are coupled together in pairs,[751]\r\nof which the components are separated by eight years, recurring at\r\nintervals alternately of 105-1/2 and 121-1/2 years. Thus, the first\r\ncalculated transit took place in December, 1631, and its companion\r\n(observed by Horrocks) in the same month (N.S.), 1639. Then, after the\r\nlapse of 121-1/2 years, came the June couple of 1761 and 1769; and again\r\nafter 105-1/2, the two last observed, December 8, 1874, and December 6,\r\n1882. Throughout the twentieth century there will be no transit of\r\nVenus; but the astronomers of the twenty-first will only have to wait\r\nfour years for the first of a June pair. The rarity of these events is\r\ndue to the fact that the orbits of the earth and Venus do not lie in the\r\nsame plane. If they did, there would be a transit each time that our\r\ntwin-planet overtakes us in her more rapid circling--that is, on an\r\naverage, every 584 days. As things are actually arranged, she passes\r\nabove or below the sun, except when she happens to be very near the line\r\nof intersection of the two tracks.\r\n\r\nSuch an occurrence as a transit of Venus seems, at first sight, full of\r\npromise for solving the problem of the sun's distance. For nothing would\r\nappear easier than to determine exactly either the duration of the\r\npassage of a small, dark orb across a large brilliant disc, or the\r\ninstant of its entry upon or exit from it. And the differences in these\r\ntimes (which, owing to the comparative nearness of Venus, are quite\r\nconsiderable), as observed from remote parts of the earth, can be\r\ntranslated into differences of space--that is, into apparent or\r\nparallactic displacements, whereby the distance of Venus becomes known,\r\nand thence, by a simple sum in proportion, the distance of the sun. But\r\nin that word \"exactly\" what snares and pitfalls lie hid! It is so easy\r\nto think and to say; so indefinitely hard to realise. The astronomers of\r\nthe eighteenth century were full of hope and zeal. They confidently\r\nexpected to attain, through the double opportunity offered them, to\r\nsomething like a permanent settlement of the statistics of our system.\r\nThey were grievously disappointed. The uncertainty as to the sun's\r\ndistance, which they had counted upon reducing to a few hundred thousand\r\nmiles, remained at many millions.\r\n\r\nIn 1822, however, Encke, then director of the Seeberg Observatory near\r\nGotha, undertook to bring order out of the confusion of discordant, and\r\ndiscordantly interpreted observations. His combined result for both\r\ntransits (1761 and 1769) was published in 1824,[752] and met universal\r\nacquiescence. The parallax of the sun thereby established was 8·5776\",\r\ncorresponding to a mean distance[753] of 95-1/4 million miles. Yet this\r\nabolition of doubt was far from being so satisfactory as it seemed.\r\nSerenity on the point lasted exactly thirty years. It was disturbed in\r\n1854 by Hansen's announcement[754] that the observed motions of the moon\r\ncould be drawn into accord with theory only on the terms of bringing the\r\nsun considerably nearer to us than he was supposed to be.\r\n\r\nDr. Matthew Stewart, professor of mathematics in the University of\r\nEdinburgh, had made a futile attempt in 1763 to deduce the sun's\r\ndistance from his disturbing power over our satellite.[755] Tobias Mayer\r\nof Göttingen, however, whose short career was fruitful of suggestions,\r\nstruck out the right way to the same end; and Laplace, in the seventh\r\nbook of the _Mécanique Céleste_,[756] gave a solar parallax derived from\r\nthe lunar \"parallactic inequality\" substantially identical with that\r\nissuing from Encke's subsequent discussion of the eighteenth-century\r\ntransits. Thus, two wholly independent methods--the trigonometrical,\r\nor method by survey, and the gravitational, or method by\r\nperturbation--seemed to corroborate each the upshot of the use of the\r\nother until the nineteenth century was well past its meridian. It is\r\nsingular how often errors conspire to lead conviction astray.\r\n\r\nHansen's note of alarm in 1854 was echoed by Leverrier in 1858.[757] He\r\nfound that an apparent monthly oscillation of the sun which reflects a\r\nreal monthly movement of the earth round its common centre of gravity\r\nwith the moon, and which depends for its amount solely on the mass of\r\nthe moon and the distance of the sun, required a diminution in the\r\nadmitted value of that distance by fully four million miles. Three years\r\nlater he pointed out that certain perplexing discrepancies between the\r\nobserved and computed places both of Venus and Mars, would vanish on the\r\nadoption of a similar measure.[758] Moreover, a favourable opposition of\r\nMars gave the opportunity in 1862 for fresh observations, which,\r\nseparately worked out by Stone and Winnecke, agreed with all the newer\r\ninvestigations in fixing the great unit at slightly over 91 million\r\nmiles. In Newcomb's hands they gave 92-1/2 million.[759] The\r\naccumulating evidence in favour of a large reduction in the sun's\r\ndistance was just then reinforced by an auxiliary result of a totally\r\ndifferent and unexpected kind.\r\n\r\nThe discovery that light does not travel instantaneously from point to\r\npoint, but takes some short time in transmission, was made by Olaus\r\nRömer in 1675, through observing that the eclipses of Jupiter's\r\nsatellites invariably occurred later, when the earth was on the far\r\nside, than when it was on the near side of its orbit. Half the\r\ndifference, or the time spent by a luminous vibration in crossing the\r\n\"mean radius\" of the earth's orbit, is called the \"light-equation\"; and\r\nthe determination of its precise value has claimed the minute care\r\ndistinctive of modern astronomy. Delambre in 1792 made it 493 seconds.\r\nGlasenapp, a Russian astronomer, raised the estimate in 1874 to 501,\r\nProfessor Harkness adopts a safe medium value of 498 seconds. Hence, if\r\nwe had any independent means of ascertaining how fast light travels, we\r\ncould tell at once how far off the sun is.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another way by which knowledge of the swiftness of light\r\nwould lead us straight to the goal. The heavenly bodies are perceived,\r\nwhen carefully watched and measured, to be pushed forward out of their\r\ntrue places, in the direction of the earth's motion, by a very minute\r\nquantity. This effect (already adverted to) has been known since\r\nBradley's time as \"aberration.\" It arises from a combination of the two\r\nmovements of the earth round the sun and of the light-waves through the\r\nether. If the earth stood still, or if light spent no time on the road\r\nfrom the stars, such an effect would not exist. Its amount represents\r\nthe proportion between the velocities with which the earth and the\r\nlight-rays pursue their respective journeys. This proportion is,\r\nroughly, one to ten thousand. So that here again, if we knew the rate\r\nper second of luminous transmission, we should also know the rate per\r\nsecond of the earth's movement, consequently the size of its orbit and\r\nthe distance of the sun.\r\n\r\nBut, until lately, instead of finding the distance of the sun from the\r\nvelocity of light, there has been no means of ascertaining the velocity\r\nof light except through the imperfect knowledge possessed as to the\r\ndistance of the sun. The first successful terrestrial experiments on the\r\npoint date from 1849; and it is certainly no slight triumph of human\r\ningenuity to have taken rigorous account of the delay of a sunbeam in\r\nflashing from one mirror to another. Fizeau led the way,[760] and he was\r\nsucceeded, after a few months, by Léon Foucault,[761] who, in 1862, had\r\nso far perfected Wheatstone's method of revolving mirrors, as to be able\r\nto announce with authority that light travelled slower, and that the sun\r\nwas in consequence nearer than had been supposed.[762] Thus a third line\r\nof separate research was found to converge to the same point with the\r\ntwo others.\r\n\r\nSuch a conspiracy of proof was not to be resisted, and at the\r\nanniversary meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society in February, 1864,\r\nthe correction of the solar distance took the foremost place in the\r\nannals of the year. Lest, however, a sudden bound of four million miles\r\nnearer to the centre of our system should shake public faith in\r\nastronomical accuracy, it was explained that the change in the solar\r\nparallax corresponding to that huge leap, amounted to no more than the\r\nbreadth of a human hair 125 feet from the eye![763] The Nautical Almanac\r\ngave from 1870 the altered value of 8.95\", for which Newcomb's result of\r\n8.85\", adopted in 1869 in the Berlin Ephemeris, was substituted some ten\r\nyears later. In astronomical literature the change was initiated by Sir\r\nEdmund Beckett in the first edition (1865) of his _Astronomy without\r\nMathematics_.\r\n\r\nIf any doubt remained as to the misleading character of Encke's\r\ndeduction, so long implicitly trusted in, it was removed by Powalky's\r\nand Stone's rediscussions, in 1864 and 1868 respectively, of the transit\r\nobservations of 1769. Using improved determinations of the longitude of\r\nthe various stations, and a selective judgment in dealing with their\r\nmaterials, which, however indispensable, did not escape adverse\r\ncriticism, they brought out results confirmatory of the no longer\r\ndisputed necessity for largely increasing the solar parallax, and\r\nproportionately diminishing the solar distance. Once more in 1890, and\r\nthis time with better success, the eighteenth-century transits were\r\ninvestigated by Professor Newcomb.[764] Turning to account the\r\nexperience gained in the interim regarding the optical phenomena\r\naccompanying such events, he elicited from the mass of somewhat\r\ndiscordant observations at his command, a parallax (8·79\") in close\r\nagreement with the value given by sundry modes of recent research.\r\n\r\nConclusions on the subject, however, were still regarded as purely\r\nprovisional. A transit of Venus was fast approaching, and to its\r\narbitrament, as to that of a court of final appeal, the pending question\r\nwas to be referred. It is true that the verdict in the same case by the\r\nsame tribunal a century earlier had proved of so indecisive a character\r\nas to form only a starting-point for fresh litigation; but that century\r\nhad not passed in vain, and it was confidently anticipated that\r\nobservational difficulties, then equally unexpected and insuperable,\r\nwould yield to the elaborate care and skill of forewarned modern\r\npreparation.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of the transit of December 8, 1874, were sketched out by\r\nSir George Airy, then Astronomer-Royal, in 1857,[765] and formed the\r\nsubject of eager discussion in this and other countries down to the very\r\neve of the occurrence. In these Mr. Proctor took a leading part; and it\r\nwas due to his urgent representations that provision was made for the\r\nemployment of the method identified with the name of Halley,[766] which\r\nhad been too hastily assumed inapplicable to the first of each\r\ntransit-pair. It depends upon the difference in the length of time taken\r\nby the planet to cross the sun's disc, as seen from various points of\r\nthe terrestrial surface, and requires, accordingly, the visibility of\r\nboth entrance and exit at the same station. Since these were, in 1874,\r\nseparated by about three and a half hours, and the interval may be much\r\nlonger, the choice of posts for the successful use of the \"method of\r\ndurations\" is a matter of some difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe system described by Delisle in 1760, on the other hand, involves\r\nmerely noting the instant of ingress or egress (according to situation)\r\nfrom opposite extremities of a terrestrial diameter; the disparity in\r\ntime giving a measure of the planet's apparent displacement, hence of\r\nits actual rate of travel in miles per minute, from which its distances\r\nseverally from earth and sun are immediately deducible. Its chief\r\nattendant difficulty is the necessity for accurately fixing the\r\nlongitudes of the points of observation. But this was much more sensibly\r\nfelt a century ago than it is now, the improved facility and certainty\r\nof modern determinations tending to give the Delislean plan a decided\r\nsuperiority over its rival.\r\n\r\nThese two traditional methods were supplemented in 1874 by the camera\r\nand the heliometer. From photography, above all, much was expected.\r\nObservations made by its means would have the advantages of\r\nimpartiality, multitude, and permanence. Peculiarities of vision and\r\nbias of judgment would be eliminated; the slow progress of the\r\nphenomenon would permit an indefinite number of pictures to be taken,\r\ntheir epochs fixed to a fraction of a second; while subsequent leisurely\r\ncomparison and measurement could hardly fail, it was thought, to educe\r\napproximate truth from the mass of accumulated evidence. The use of the\r\nheliometer (much relied on by German observers) was so far similar to\r\nthat of the camera that the object aimed at by both was the\r\ndetermination of the relative positions of the _centres_ of the sun and\r\nVenus viewed, at the same absolute instant, from opposite sides of the\r\nglobe. So that the principle of the two older methods was to ascertain\r\nthe exact times of meeting between the solar and planetary limbs; that\r\nof the two modern to determine the position of the dark body already\r\nthrown into complete relief by its shining background. The former are\r\n\"methods by contact,\" the latter \"methods by projection.\"\r\n\r\nEvery country which had a reputation to keep or to gain for scientific\r\nzeal was forward to co-operate in the great cosmopolitan enterprise of\r\nthe transit. France and Germany each sent out six expeditions;\r\ntwenty-six stations were in Russian, twelve in English, eight in\r\nAmerican, three in Italian, one in Dutch occupation. In all, at a cost\r\nof nearly a quarter of a million, some fourscore distinct posts of\r\nobservation were provided; among them such inhospitable, and all but\r\ninaccessible rocks in the bleak Southern Ocean, as St. Paul's and\r\nCampbell Islands, swept by hurricanes, and fitted only for the\r\nhabitation of seabirds, where the daring votaries of science, in the\r\nwise prevision of a long leaguer by the elements, were supplied with\r\nstores for many months, or even a whole year. Siberia and the Sandwich\r\nIslands were thickly beset with observers; parties of three\r\nnationalities encamped within the mists of Kerguelen Island,\r\nexpressively termed the \"Land of Desolation,\" in the sanguine, though\r\nnot wholly frustrated hope of a glimpse of the sun at the right moment.\r\nM. Janssen narrowly escaped destruction from a typhoon in the China seas\r\non his way to Nagasaki; Lord Lindsay (now Earl of Crawford and\r\nBalcarres) equipped, at his private expense, an expedition to Mauritius,\r\nwhich was in itself an epitome of modern resource and ingenuity.\r\n\r\nDuring several years, the practical methods best suited to insure\r\nsuccess for the impending enterprise formed a subject of European\r\ndebate. Official commissions were appointed to receive and decide upon\r\nevidence; and experiments were in progress for the purpose of defining\r\nthe actual circumstances of contacts, the precise determination of which\r\nconstituted the only tried, though by no means an assuredly safe road to\r\nthe end in view. In England, America, France, and Germany, artificial\r\ntransits were mounted, and the members of the various expeditions were\r\ncarefully trained to unanimity in estimating the phases of junction and\r\nseparation between a moving dark circular body and a broad illuminated\r\ndisc. In the previous century, a formidable and prevalent phenomenon,\r\nwhich acquired notoriety as the \"Black Drop\" or \"Black Ligament,\" had\r\nswamped all pretensions to rigid accuracy. It may be described as\r\nsubstituting adhesion for contact, the limbs of the sun and planet,\r\ninstead of meeting and parting with the desirable clean definiteness,\r\n_clinging_ together as if made of some glutinous material, and\r\nprolonging their connection by means of a dark band or dark threads\r\nstretched between them. Some astronomers ascribed this baffling\r\nappearance entirely to instrumental imperfections; others to atmospheric\r\nagitation; others again to the optical encroachment of light upon\r\ndarkness known as \"irradiation.\" It is probable that all these causes\r\nconspired, in various measure, to produce it; and it is certain that its\r\n_conspicuous_ appearance may, by suitable precautions, be obviated.\r\n\r\nThe organisation of the British forces reflected the utmost credit on\r\nthe energy and ability of Lieutenant-Colonel Tupman, who was responsible\r\nfor the whole. No useful measure was neglected. Each observer went out\r\nticketed with his \"personal equation,\" his senses drilled into a species\r\nof martial discipline, his powers absorbed, so far as possible, in the\r\naction of a cosmopolitan observing machine. Instrumental uniformity and\r\nuniformity of method were obtainable, and were attained; but diversity\r\nof judgment unhappily survived the best-directed efforts for its\r\nextirpation.\r\n\r\nThe eventful day had no sooner passed than telegrams began to pour in,\r\nannouncing an outcome of considerable, though not unqualified success.\r\nThe weather had proved generally favourable; the manifold arrangements\r\nhad worked well; contacts had been plentifully observed; photographs in\r\nlavish abundance had been secured; a store of materials, in short, had\r\nbeen laid up, of which it would take years to work out the full results\r\nby calculation. Gradually, nevertheless, it came to be known that the\r\nhope of a definitive issue must be abandoned. Unanimity was found to be\r\nas remote as ever. The dreaded \"black ligament\" gave, indeed, less\r\ntrouble than was expected; but another appearance supervened which took\r\nmost observers by surprise. This was the illumination due to the\r\natmosphere of Venus. Astronomers, it is true, were not ignorant that the\r\nplanet had, on previous occasions, been seen girdled with a lucid ring;\r\nbut its power to mar observations by the distorting effect of refraction\r\nhad scarcely been reckoned with. It proved, however, to be very great.\r\nSuch was the difficulty of determining the critical instant of internal\r\ncontact, that (in Colonel Tupman's words) \"observers side by side, with\r\nadequate optical means, differed as much as twenty or thirty seconds in\r\nthe times they recorded for phenomena which they have described in\r\nalmost identical language.\"[767]\r\n\r\nSuch uncertainties in the data admitted of a corresponding variety in\r\nthe results. From the British observations of ingress and egress Sir\r\nGeorge Airy[768] derived, in 1877, a solar parallax of 8·76\" (corrected\r\nto 8·754\"), indicating a mean distance of 93,375,000 miles. Mr. Stone\r\nobtained a value of ninety-two millions (parallax 8·88\"), and held any\r\nparallax less than 8·84\" or more than 8·93\" to be \"absolutely negatived\"\r\nby the documents available.[769] Yet, from the same, Colonel Tupman\r\ndeduced 8·81\",[770] implying a distance 700,000 miles greater than Stone\r\nhad obtained. The best French observations of contacts gave a parallax\r\nof about 8·88\"; French micrometric measures the obviously exaggerated\r\none of 9·05\".[771]\r\n\r\nPhotography, as practised by most of the European parties, was a total\r\nfailure. Utterly discrepant values of the microscopic displacements\r\ndesigned to serve as sounding lines for the solar system, issued from\r\nattempts to measure even the most promising pictures. \"You might as well\r\ntry to measure the zodiacal light,\" it was remarked to Sir George Airy.\r\nThose taken on the American plan of using telescopes of so great focal\r\nlength as to afford, without further enlargement, an image of the\r\nrequisite size, gave notably better results. From an elaborate\r\ncomparison of those dating from Vladivostock, Nagasaki, and Pekin, with\r\nothers from Kerguelen and Chatham Islands, Professor D. P. Todd, of\r\nAmherst College, deduced a solar distance of about ninety-two million\r\nmiles (parallax 8·883\" ±0·034\"),[772] and the value was much favoured by\r\nconcurrent evidence.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, estimates of the great spatial unit cannot be said to have\r\ngained any security from the combined effort of 1874. A few months\r\nbefore the transit, Mr. Proctor considered that the uncertainty then\r\namounted to 1,448,000 miles;[773] five years after the transit,\r\nProfessor Harkness judged it to be still 1,575,950 miles;[774] yet it\r\nhad been hoped that it would have been brought down to 100,000. As\r\nregards the end for which it had been undertaken, the grand campaign had\r\ncome to nothing. Nevertheless, no sign of discouragement was apparent.\r\nThere was a change of view, but no relaxation of purpose. The problem,\r\nit was seen, could be solved by no single heroic effort, but by the\r\npatient approximation of gradual improvements. Astronomers, accordingly,\r\nlooked round for fresh means or more refined expedients for applying\r\nthose already known. A new phase of exertion was entered upon.\r\n\r\nOn September 5, 1877, Mars came into opposition near the part of his\r\norbit which lies nearest to that of the earth, and Dr. Gill (now Sir\r\nDavid) took advantage of the circumstance to appeal once more to him for\r\na decision on the _quæstio vexata_ of the sun's distance. He chose, as\r\nthe scene of his labours, the Island of Ascension, and for their plan a\r\nmethod recommended by Airy in 1857,[775] but never before fairly tried.\r\nThis is known as the \"diurnal method of parallaxes.\" Its principle\r\nconsists in substituting successive morning and evening observations\r\nfrom the same spot, for simultaneous observations from remote spots, the\r\nrotation of the earth supplying the necessary difference in the points\r\nof view. Its great advantage is that of unity in performance. A single\r\nmind, looking through the same pair of eyes, reinforced with the same\r\noptical appliances, is employed throughout, and the errors inseparable\r\nfrom the combination of data collected under different conditions are\r\navoided. There are many cases in which one man can do the work of two\r\nbetter than two men can do the work of one. The result of Gill's skilful\r\ndeterminations (made with Lord Lindsay's heliometer) was a solar\r\nparallax of 8·78\", corresponding to a distance of 93,080,000 miles.[776]\r\nThe bestowal of the Royal Astronomical Society's gold medal stamped the\r\nmerit of this distinguished service.\r\n\r\nBut there are other subjects for this kind of inquiry besides Mars and\r\nVenus. Professor Galle of Breslau suggested in 1872[777] that some of\r\nthe minor planets might be got to repay astronomers for much\r\ndisinterested toil spent in unravelling their motions, by lending aid to\r\ntheir efforts towards a correct celestial survey. Ten or twelve come\r\nnear enough, and are bright enough for the purpose; in fact, the absence\r\nof sensible magnitude is one of their chief recommendations, since a\r\npoint of light offers far greater facilities for exact measurement than\r\na disc. The first attempt to work this new vein was made at the\r\nopposition of Phocæa in 1872; and from observations of Flora in the\r\nfollowing year at twelve observatories in the northern and southern\r\nhemispheres, Galle deduced a solar parallax of 8·87\".[778] At Mauritius\r\nin 1874, Lord Lindsay and Sir David Gill applied the \"diurnal method\" to\r\nJuno, then conveniently situated for the purpose; and the continued use\r\nof similar occasions affords an unexceptionable means for improving\r\nknowledge of the sun's distance. They frequently recur; they need no\r\nelaborate preparation; a single astronomer armed with a heliometer can\r\ndo all the requisite work. Dr. Gill, however, organized a more complex\r\nplan of operations upon Iris in 1888, and upon Victoria and Sappho in\r\n1889. A novel method was adopted. Its object was to secure simultaneous\r\nobservations made from opposite sides of the globe just when the planet\r\nlay in the plane passing through the centre of the earth and the two\r\nobservers, the same pair of reference-stars being used on each occasion.\r\nThe displacements caused by parallax were thus in a sense doubled, since\r\nthe star to which the planet seemed approximated in the northern\r\nhemisphere, showed as if slightly removed from it in the southern, and\r\n_vice versâ_. As the planet pursued its course, fresh star-couples came\r\ninto play, during the weeks that the favourable period lasted. In these\r\ndeterminations, only heliometers were employed. Dr. Elkin, of Yale\r\ncollege, co-operated throughout, and the heliometers of Dresden,\r\nGöttingen, Bamberg, and Leipzig, shared in the work, while Dr. Auwers of\r\nBerlin was Sir David Gill's personal coadjutor at the Cape. Voluminous\r\ndata were collected; meridian observations of the stars of reference for\r\nVictoria occupied twenty-one establishments during four months; the\r\ndirect work of triangulation kept four heliometers in almost exclusive\r\nuse for the best part of a year; and the ensuing toilsome computations,\r\ncarried out during three years at the Cape Observatory, filled two bulky\r\ntomes[779] with their details. Gill's final result, published in 1897,\r\nwas a parallax of 8·802\", equivalent to a solar distance of 92,874,000;\r\nand it was qualified by a probable error so small that the value might\r\nwell have been accepted as definitive but for an unlooked-for discovery.\r\nThe minor planet Eros, detected August 14, 1898, was found to pursue a\r\ncourse rendering it an almost ideal intermediary in solar\r\nparallax-determinations. Once in thirty years, it comes within fifteen\r\nmillion miles of the earth; and although the next of these choice epochs\r\nmust be awaited for some decades, an opposition too favourable to be\r\nneglected occurred in 1900. At an International Conference, accordingly,\r\nheld at Paris in July of that year, a plan of photographic operations\r\nwas concerted between the representatives of no less than 58\r\nobservatories.[780] Its primary object was to secure a large stock of\r\nnegatives showing the planet with the comparison-stars along the route\r\ntraversed by it from October, 1900, to March, 1901,[781] and this at\r\nleast was successfully attained. Their measurement will in due time\r\neduce the apparent displacements of the moving object as viewed\r\nsimultaneously from remote parts of the earth; and the upshot should be\r\na solar parallax adequate in accuracy to the exigent demands of the\r\ntwentieth century.\r\n\r\nThe second of the nineteenth-century pair of Venus-transits was looked\r\nforward to with much abated enthusiasm. Russia refused her active\r\nco-operation in observing it, on the ground that oppositions of the\r\nminor planets were trigonometrically more useful, and financially far\r\nless costly; and her example was followed by Austria; while Italian\r\nastronomers limited their sphere of action to their own peninsula.\r\nNevertheless, it was generally held that a phenomenon which the world\r\ncould not again witness until it was four generations older should, at\r\nthe price of any effort, not be allowed to pass in neglect.\r\n\r\nThe persuasion of its importance justified the summoning of an\r\nInternational Conference at Paris in 1881, from which, however, America,\r\npreferring independent action, held aloof. It was decided to give\r\nDelisle's method another trial; and the ambiguities attending and\r\nmarring its use were sought to be obviated by careful regulations for\r\ninsuring agreement in the estimation of the critical moments of ingress\r\nand egress.[782] But in fact (as M. Puiseux had shown[783]), contacts\r\nbetween the limbs of the sun and planet, so far from possessing the\r\ngeometrical simplicity attributed to them, are really made up of a\r\nprolonged succession of various and varying phases, impossible either to\r\npredict or identify with anything like rigid exactitude. Sir Robert Ball\r\ncompared the task of determining the precise instant of their meeting or\r\nparting, to that of telling the hour with accuracy on a watch without a\r\nminute hand; and the comparison is admittedly inadequate. For not only\r\nis the apparent movement of Venus across the sun extremely slow, being\r\nbut the excess of her real motion over that of the earth; but three\r\ndistinct atmospheres--the solar, terrestrial, and Cytherean--combine to\r\ndeform outlines and mask the geometrical relations which it is desired\r\nto connect with a strict count of time.\r\n\r\nThe result was very much what had been expected. The arrangements were\r\nexcellent, and were only in a few cases disconcerted by bad weather. The\r\nBritish parties, under the experienced guidance of Mr. Stone, the late\r\nRadcliffe observer, took up positions scattered over the globe, from\r\nQueensland to Bermuda; the Americans collected a whole library of\r\nphotographs; the Germans and Belgians trusted to the heliometer; the\r\nFrench used the camera as an adjunct to the method of contacts. Yet\r\nlittle or no approach was made to solving the problem. Thus, from 606\r\nmeasures of Venus on the sun, taken with a new kind of heliometer at\r\nSantiago in Chili, M. Houzeau, of the Brussels Observatory, derived a\r\nsolar parallax of 8.907\", and a distance of 91,727,000 miles.[784] But\r\nthe \"probable errors\" of this determination amounted to 0.084\" either\r\nway: it was subject to a \"more or less\" of 900,000, or to a total\r\nuncertainty of 1,800,000 miles. The \"probable error\" of the English\r\nresult, published in 1887, was less formidable,[785] yet the details of\r\nthe discussion showed that no great confidence could be placed in it.\r\nThe sun's distance came out 92,560,000 miles; while 92,360,000 was given\r\nby Professor Harkness's investigation of 1,475 American\r\nphotographs.[786] Finally, Dr. Auwers deduced from the German\r\nheliometric measures the unsatisfactorily small value of 92,000,000\r\nmiles.[787] The transit of 1882 had not, then, brought about the desired\r\nunanimity.\r\n\r\nThe state and progress of knowledge on this important topic were summed\r\nup by Faye and Harkness in 1881.[788] The methods employed in its\r\ninvestigation fall (as we have seen) into three separate classes--the\r\ntrigonometrical, the gravitational, and the \"phototachymetrical\"--an\r\nungainly adjective used to describe the method by the velocity of light.\r\nEach has its special difficulties and sources of error; each has\r\ncounter-balancing advantages. The only trustworthy result from celestial\r\nsurveys, was at that time furnished by Gill's observations of Mars in\r\n1877. But the method by lunar and planetary disturbances is unlike all\r\nthe others in having time on its side. It is this which Leverrier\r\ndeclared with emphasis must inevitably prevail, because its accuracy is\r\ncontinually growing.[789] The scarcely perceptible errors which still\r\nimpede its application are of such a nature as to accumulate year by\r\nyear; eventually, then, they will challenge, and must receive, a more\r\nand more perfect correction. The light-velocity method, however,\r\nclaimed, and for some years justified, M. Faye's preference.\r\n\r\nBy a beautiful series of experiments on Foucault's principle, Michelson\r\nfixed in 1879 the rate of luminous transmission at 299,930 (corrected\r\nlater to 299,910) kilometres a second.[790] This determination was held\r\nby Professor Todd to be entitled to four times as much confidence as any\r\nprevious one; and if the solar parallax of 8·758\" deduced from it by\r\nProfessor Harkness errs somewhat by defect, it is doubtless because\r\nGlasenapp's \"light-equation,\" with which it was combined, errs slightly\r\nby excess. But all earlier efforts of the kind were thrown into the\r\nshade by Professor Newcomb's arduous operations at Washington in\r\n1880-1882.[791] The scale upon which they were conducted was in itself\r\nimpressive. Foucault's entire apparatus in 1862 had been enclosed in a\r\nsingle room; Newcomb's revolving and fixed mirrors, between which the\r\nrays of light were to run their timed course, were set up on opposite\r\nshores of the Potomac, at a distance of nearly four kilometres. This\r\nadvantage was turned to the utmost account by ingenuity and skill in\r\ncontrivance and execution; and the deduced velocity of 299,860\r\nkilometres = 186,328 miles a second, had an estimated error (30\r\nkilometres) only one-tenth that ascribed by Cornu to his own result in\r\n1874.\r\n\r\nJust as these experiments were concluded in 1882, M. Magnus Nyrén, of\r\nSt. Petersburg, published an elaborate investigation of the small\r\nannular displacements of the stars due to the successive transmission of\r\nlight, involving an increase of Struve's \"constant of aberration\" from\r\n20·445\" to 20·492\". And from the new value, combined with Newcomb's\r\nlight-velocity, was derived a valuable approximation to the sun's\r\ndistance, concluded at 92,905,021 miles (parallax = 8·794\"). Yet it is\r\nnot quite certain that Nyrén's correction was an improvement. A\r\ndifferential method of determining the amount of aberration, struck out\r\nby M. Loewy of Paris,[792] avoids most of the objections to the absolute\r\nmethod previously in vogue; and the upshot of its application in 1891\r\nwas to show that Struve's constant might better be retained than\r\naltered, Loewy's of 20·447\" varying from it only to an insignificant\r\nextent. Professor Hall had, moreover, deduced nearly the same value\r\n(20·454\") from the Washington observations since 1862, of Alpha\r\nLyræ (Vega); whence, in conjunction with Newcomb's rate of light\r\ntransmission, he arrived at a solar parallax of 8·81\".[793] Inverting\r\nthe process, Sir David Gill in 1897 derived the constant from the\r\nparallax. If the earth's orbit have a mean radius, as found by him, of\r\n92,874,000 miles, then, he calculated, the aberration of\r\nlight--Newcomb's measures of its velocity being supposed exact--amounts\r\nto 20.467\". This figure can need very slight correction.\r\n\r\nProfessor Harkness surveyed in 1891,[794] from an eclectic point of\r\nview, the general situation as regarded the sun's parallax. Convinced\r\nthat no single method deserved an exclusive preference, he reached a\r\nplausible result through the combination, on the principle of least\r\nsquares--that is, by the mathematical rules of probability--of all the\r\nvarious quantities upon which the great datum depends. It thus summed up\r\nand harmonised the whole of the multifarious evidence bearing upon the\r\npoint, and, as modified in 1894,[795] falls very satisfactorily into\r\nline with the Cape determination. We may, then, at least provisionally,\r\naccept 92,870,000 miles as the length of our measuring-rod for space.\r\nNor do we hazard much in fixing 100,000 miles as the outside limit of\r\nits future correction.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 748: Airy, _Month.

He did not, it\r\nis true, possess the more brilliant gifts of his rival. Herschel's\r\npiercing discernment, comprehensive intelligence, and inventive\r\nsplendour were wanting to him. He was, nevertheless, the founder of\r\ndescriptive astronomy in Germany, as Herschel was in England.\r\n\r\nBorn at Erfurt in 1745, he prosecuted legal studies at Göttingen, and\r\nthere imbibed from Kästner a life-long devotion to science. From the\r\nlaw, however, he got the means of living, and, what was to the full as\r\nprecious to him, the means of observing. Entering the sphere of\r\nHanoverian officialism in 1788, he settled a few years later at\r\nLilienthal, near Bremen, as \"Oberamtmann,\" or chief magistrate. Here he\r\nbuilt a small observatory, enriched in 1785 with a seven-foot reflector\r\nby Herschel, then one of the most powerful instruments to be found\r\nanywhere out of England. It was soon surpassed, through his exertions,\r\nby the first-fruits of native industry in that branch. Schrader of Kiel\r\ntransferred his workshops to Lilienthal in 1792, and constructed there,\r\nunder the superintendence and at the cost of the astronomical\r\nOberamtmann, a thirteen-foot reflector, declared by Lalande to be the\r\nfinest telescope in existence, and one twenty-seven feet in focal\r\nlength, probably as inferior to its predecessor in real efficiency as it\r\nwas superior in size.\r\n\r\nThus, with instruments of gradually increasing power, Schröter studied\r\nduring thirty-four years the topography of the moon and planets. The\r\nfield was then almost untrodden; he had but few and casual predecessors,\r\nand has since had no equal in the sustained and concentrated patience of\r\nhis hourly watchings. Both their prolixity and their enthusiasm are\r\nfaithfully reflected in his various treatises. Yet the one may be\r\npardoned for the sake of the other, especially when it is remembered\r\nthat he struck out a substantially new line, and that one of the main\r\nlines of future advance. Moreover, his infectious zeal communicated\r\nitself; he set the example of observing when there was scarcely an\r\nobserver in Germany; and under his roof Harding and Bessel received\r\ntheir training as practical astronomers.\r\n\r\nBut he was reserved to see evil days. Early in 1813 the French under\r\nVandamme occupied Bremen. On the night of April 20, the Vale of Lilies\r\nwas, by their wanton destructiveness, laid waste with fire; the\r\nGovernment offices were destroyed, and with them the chief part of\r\nSchröter's property, including the whole stock of his books and\r\nwritings. There was worse behind. A few days later, his observatory,\r\nwhich had escaped the conflagration, was broken into, pillaged, and\r\nruined. His life was wrecked with it. He survived the catastrophe three\r\nyears without the means to repair, or the power to forget it, and\r\ngradually sank from disappointment into decay, terminated by death,\r\nAugust 29, 1816. He had, indeed, done all the work he was capable of;\r\nand though not of the first quality, it was far from contemptible. He\r\nlaid the foundation of the _comparative_ study of the moon's surface,\r\nand the descriptive particulars of the planets laboriously collected by\r\nhim constituted a store of more or less reliable information hardly\r\nadded to during the ensuing half century. They rested, it is true, under\r\nsome shadow of doubt; but the most recent observations have tended on\r\nseveral points to rehabilitate the discredited authority of the\r\nLilienthal astronomer. We may now briefly resume, and pursue in its\r\nfurther progress, the course of his studies, taking the planets in the\r\norder of their distances from the sun.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1792, Schröter saw reason to conclude, from the gradual\r\ndegradation of light on its partially illuminated disc, that Mercury\r\npossesses a tolerably dense atmosphere.[796] During the transit of May\r\n7, 1799, he was, moreover, struck with the appearance of a ring of\r\nsoftened luminosity encircling the planet to an apparent height of three\r\nseconds, or about a quarter of its own diameter.[797] Although a \"mere\r\nthought\" in texture, it remained persistently visible both with the\r\nseven-foot and the thirteen-foot reflectors, armed with powers up to\r\n288. It had a well-marked grayish boundary, and reminded him, though\r\nindefinitely fainter, of the penumbra of a sun-spot. A similar appendage\r\nhad been noticed by De Plantade at Montpellier, November 11, 1736, and\r\nagain in 1786 and 1789 by Prosperin and Flaugergues; but Herschel, on\r\nNovember 9, 1802, saw the preceding limb of the planet projected on the\r\nsun cut the luminous solar clouds with the most perfect sharpness.[798]\r\nThe presence, however, of a \"halo\" was unmistakable in 1832, when\r\nProfessor Moll, of Utrecht, described it as a \"nebulous ring of a darker\r\ntinge approaching to the violet colour.\"[799] Again, to Huggins and\r\nStone, November 5, 1868, it showed as lucid and most distinct. No change\r\nin the colour of the glasses used, or the powers applied, could get rid\r\nof it, and it lasted throughout the transit.[800] It was next seen by\r\nChristie and Dunkin at Greenwich, May 6, 1878,[801] and with much\r\nprecision of detail by Trouvelot at Cambridge (U.S.).[802] Professor\r\nHolden, on the other hand, noted at Hastings-on-Hudson the total absence\r\nof all anomalous appearances.[803] Nor could any vestige of them be\r\nperceived by Barnard at Lick on November 10, 1894.[804] Various effects\r\nof irradiation and diffraction were, however, observed by Lowell and W.\r\nH. Pickering at Flagstaff;[805] and Davidson was favoured at San\r\nFrancisco with glimpses of the historic aureola,[806] as well as of a\r\ncentral whitish spot, which often accompanies it. That both are somehow\r\nof optical production can scarcely be doubted.\r\n\r\nNothing can be learned from them regarding the planet's physical\r\ncondition. Airy showed that refraction in a Mercurian atmosphere could\r\nnot possibly originate the noted aureola, which must accordingly be set\r\ndown as \"strictly an ocular nervous phenomenon.\"[807] It is the less\r\neasy to escape from this conclusion that we find the virtually airless\r\nmoon capable of exhibiting a like appendage. Professor Stephen\r\nAlexander, of the United States Survey, with two other observers,\r\nperceived, during the eclipse of the sun of July 18, 1860, the advancing\r\nlunar limb to be bordered with a bright band;[808] and photographic\r\neffects of the same kind appear in pictures of transits of Venus and\r\npartial solar eclipses.\r\n\r\nThe spectroscope affords little information as to the constitution of\r\nMercury. Its light is of course that of the sun reflected, and its\r\nspectrum is consequently a faint echo of the Fraunhofer spectrum. Dr. H.\r\nC. Vogel, who first examined it in April, 1871, _suspected_ traces of\r\nthe action of an atmosphere like ours,[809] but, it would seem, on\r\nslight grounds. It is, however, certainly very poor in blue rays. More\r\ndefinite conclusions were, in 1874,[810] derived by Zöllner from\r\nphotometric observations of Mercurian phases. A similar study of the\r\nwaxing and waning moon had afforded him the curious discovery that\r\nlight-changes dependent upon phase vary with the nature of the\r\nreflecting surface, following a totally different law on a smooth\r\nhomogeneous globe and on a rugged and mountainous one. Now the phases of\r\nMercury--so far as could be determined from only two sets of\r\nobservations--correspond with the latter kind of structure. Strictly\r\nanalogous to those of the moon, they seem to indicate an analogous mode\r\nof surface-formation. This conclusion was fully borne out by Müller's\r\nmore extended observations at Potsdam during the years 1885-1893.[811]\r\nPractical assurance was gained from them that the innermost planet has a\r\nrough rind of dusky rock, absorbing all but 17 per cent. of the light\r\npoured upon it by the fierce adjacent sun. Its \"albedo,\" in other words,\r\nis 0·17,[812] which is precisely that ascribed to the moon. The absence\r\nof any appreciable Mercurian atmosphere followed almost necessarily from\r\nthese results.\r\n\r\nOn March 26, 1800, Schröter, observing with his 13-foot reflector in a\r\npeculiarly clear sky, perceived the southern horn of Mercury's crescent\r\nto be quite distinctly blunted.[813] Interception of sunlight by a\r\nMercurian mountain rather more than eleven English miles high explained\r\nthe effect to his satisfaction. By carefully timing its recurrence, he\r\nconcluded rotation on an axis in a period of 24 hours 4 minutes. The\r\nfirst determination of the kind rewarded twenty years of unceasing\r\nvigilance. It received ostensible confirmation from the successive\r\nappearances of a dusky streak and blotch in May and June, 1801.[814]\r\nThese, however, were inferred to be no permanent markings on the body of\r\nthe planet, but atmospheric formations, the streak at times drifting\r\nforwards (it was thought) under the fluctuating influence of Mercurian\r\nbreezes. From a rediscussion of these somewhat doubtful observations\r\nBessel inferred that Mercury rotates on an axis inclined 70° to the\r\nplane of its orbit in 24 hours 53 seconds.\r\n\r\nThe rounded appearance of the southern horn seen by Schröter was more or\r\nless doubtfully caught by Noble (1864), Burton, and Franks (1877);[815]\r\nbut was obvious to Mr. W. F. Denning at Bristol on the morning of\r\nNovember 5, 1882.[816] That the southern polar regions are usually less\r\nbright than the northern is well ascertained; but the cause of the\r\ndeficiency remains dubious. If inequalities of surface are in question,\r\nthey must be on a considerable scale; and a similar explanation might be\r\ngiven of the deformations of the \"terminator\"--or dividing-line between\r\ndarkness and light in the planet's phases--first remarked by Schröter,\r\nand again clearly seen by Trouvelot in 1878 and 1881.[817] The\r\ndisplacement, during four days, of certain brilliant and dusky spaces on\r\nthe disc indicated to Mr. Denning in 1882 rotation in about twenty-five\r\nhours; while the general aspect of the planet reminded him of that of\r\nMars.[818] But the difficulties in the way of its observation are\r\nenormously enhanced by its constant close attendance on the sun.\r\n\r\nIn his sustained study of the features of Mercury, Schröter had no\r\nimitator until Schiaparelli took up the task at Milan in 1882. His\r\nobservations were made in daylight. It was found that much more could be\r\nseen, and higher magnifying powers used, high up in the sky near the\r\nsun, than at low altitudes, through the agitated air of morning or\r\nevening twilight. A notable discovery ensued.[819] Following the planet\r\nhour by hour, instead of making necessarily brief inspections at\r\nintervals of about a day, as previous observers had done, it was found\r\nthat the markings faintly visible remained sensibly fixed, hence, that\r\nthere was no rotation in a period at all comparable with that of the\r\nearth. And after long and patient watching, the conclusion was at last\r\nreached that Mercury turns on his axis in the same time needed to\r\ncomplete a revolution in his orbit. One of his hemispheres, then, is\r\nalways averted from the sun, as one of the moon's hemispheres from the\r\nearth, while the other never shifts from beneath his torrid rays. The\r\n\"librations,\" however, of Mercury are on a larger scale than those of\r\nthe moon, because he travels in a more eccentric path. The temporary\r\ninequalities arising between his \"even pacing\" on an axis and his\r\nalternately accelerated and retarded elliptical movement occasion, in\r\nfact, an oscillation to and fro of the boundaries of light and darkness\r\non his globe over an arc of 47° 22', in the course of his year of 88\r\ndays. Thus the regions of perpetual day and perpetual night are\r\nseparated by two segments, amounting to one-fourth of the entire\r\nsurface, where the sun rises and sets once in 88 days. Else there is no\r\nvariation from the intense glare on one side of the globe, and the\r\nnocturnal blackness on the other.\r\n\r\nTo Schiaparelli's scrutiny, Mercury appeared as a \"spotty globe,\"\r\nenveloped in a tolerably dense atmosphere. The brownish stripes and\r\nstreaks, discerned on his rose-tinged disc, and judged to be permanent,\r\nwere made the basis of a chart. They were not indeed always equally well\r\nseen. They disappeared regularly near the limb, and were at times veiled\r\neven when centrally situated. Some of them had been clearly perceived by\r\nDe Ball at Bothkamp in 1882.[820]\r\n\r\nMr. Lowell followed Schiaparelli's example by observing Mercury in the\r\nfull glare of noon. \"The best time to study him,\" he remarked, \"is when\r\nplanetary almanacs state 'Mercury invisible.'\" A remarkable series of\r\ndrawings executed, some at Flagstaff in 1896, the remainder at Mexico in\r\n1897, supplied grounds for the following, among other, conclusions.[821]\r\nMercury rotates synchronously with its revolution--that is, once in 88\r\ndays--on an axis sensibly perpendicular to its orbital plane. No certain\r\nsigns of a Mercurian atmosphere are visible. The globe is seamed and\r\nfurrowed with long narrow markings, explicable as cracks in cooling. It\r\nis, and always was, a dead world. From micrometrical measures, moreover,\r\nthe inferences were drawn that the planet's mass has a probable value\r\nabout 1/20 that of the earth, while its mean density falls considerably\r\nshort of the terrestrial standard.\r\n\r\nThe theory of Mercury's movements has always given trouble. In\r\nLalande's,[822] as in Mästlin's time, the planet seemed to exist for no\r\nother purpose than to throw discredit on astronomers; and even to\r\nLeverrier's powerful analysis it long proved recalcitrant. On the 12th\r\nof September, 1869, however, he was able to announce before the Academy\r\nof Sciences[823] the terms of a compromise between observation and\r\ncalculation. They involved the addition of a new member to the solar\r\nsystem. The hitherto unrecognised presence of a body about the size of\r\nMercury itself revolving at somewhat less than half its mean distance\r\nfrom the sun (or, if farther, then of less mass, and _vice versâ_),\r\nwould, it was pointed out, produce exactly the effect required, of\r\ndisplacing the perihelion of the former planet 38\" a century more than\r\ncould otherwise be accounted for. The planes of the two orbits, however,\r\nshould not lie far apart, as otherwise a nodal disturbance would arise\r\nnot perceived to exist. It was added that a ring of asteroids similarly\r\nplaced would answer the purpose equally well, and was more likely to\r\nhave escaped notice.\r\n\r\nUpon the heels of this forecast followed promptly a seeming\r\nverification. Dr. Lescarbault, a physician residing at Orgères, whose\r\nslender opportunities had not blunted his hopes of achievement, had,\r\never since 1845, when he witnessed a transit of Mercury, cherished the\r\nidea that an unknown planet might be caught thus projected on the solar\r\nbackground. Unable to observe continuously until 1858, he, on March 26,\r\n1859, saw what he had expected--a small perfectly round object slowly\r\ntraversing the sun's disc. The fruitless expectation of reobserving the\r\nphenomenon, however, kept him silent, and it was not until December 22,\r\nafter the news of Leverrier's prediction had reached him, that he wrote\r\nto acquaint him with his supposed discovery.[824] The Imperial\r\nAstronomer thereupon hurried down to Orgères, and by personal inspection\r\nof the simple apparatus used, by searching cross-examination and local\r\ninquiry, convinced himself of the genuine character and substantial\r\naccuracy of the reported observation. He named the new planet \"Vulcan,\"\r\nand computed elements giving it a period of revolution slightly under\r\ntwenty days.[825] But it has never since been seen. M. Liais, director\r\nof the Brazilian Coast Survey, thought himself justified in asserting\r\nthat it never had been seen. Observing the sun for twelve minutes after\r\nthe supposed ingress recorded at Orgères, he noted those particular\r\nregions of its surface as \"très uniformes d'intensité.\"[826] He\r\nsubsequently, however, admitted Lescarbault's good faith, at first\r\nrashly questioned. The planet-seeking doctor was, in truth, only one\r\namong many victims of similar illusions.\r\n\r\nWaning interest in the subject was revived by a fresh announcement of a\r\ntransit witnessed, it was asserted, by Weber at Peckeloh, April 4,\r\n1876.[827] The pseudo-planet, indeed, was detected shortly afterwards on\r\nthe Greenwich photographs, and was found to have been seen by M. Ventosa\r\nat Madrid in its true character of a sun-spot without penumbra; but\r\nLeverrier had meantime undertaken the investigation of a list of twenty\r\nsimilar dubious appearances, collected by Haase, and republished by Wolf\r\nin 1872.[828] From these, five were picked out as referring in all\r\nlikelihood to the same body, the reality of whose existence was now\r\nconfidently asserted, and of which more or less probable transits were\r\nfixed for March 22, 1877, and October 15, 1882.[829] But, widespread\r\nwatchfulness notwithstanding, no suspicious object came into view at\r\neither epoch.\r\n\r\nThe next announcement of the discovery of \"Vulcan\" was on the occasion\r\nof the total solar eclipse of July 29, 1878.[830] This time it was\r\nstated to have been seen at some distance south-west of the obscured\r\nsun, as a ruddy star with a minute planetary disc; and its simultaneous\r\ndetection by two observers--the late Professor James C. Watson,\r\nstationed at Rawlins (Wyoming Territory), and Professor Lewis Swift at\r\nDenver (Colorado)--was at first readily admitted. But their separate\r\nobservations could, on a closer examination, by no possibility be\r\nbrought into harmony, and, if valid, certainly referred to two distinct\r\nobjects, if not to four; each astronomer eventually claiming a pair of\r\nplanets. Nor could any one of the four be identified with Lescarbault's\r\nand Leverrier's Vulcan, which, if a substantial body revolving round the\r\nsun, must then have been found on the _east_ side of that luminary.[831]\r\nThe most feasible explanation of the puzzle seems to be that Watson and\r\nSwift merely saw each the same two stars in Cancer: haste and excitement\r\ndoing the rest.[832] Nevertheless, they strenuously maintained their\r\nopposite conviction.[833]\r\n\r\nIntra-Mercurian planets have since been diligently searched for when the\r\nopportunity of a total eclipse offered, especially during the long\r\nobscuration at Caroline Island. Not only did Professor Holden \"sweep\" in\r\nthe solar vicinity, but Palisa and Trouvelot agreed to divide the field\r\nof exploration, and thus make sure of whatever planetary prey there\r\nmight be within reach; yet with only negative results. Photographic\r\nexplorations during recent eclipses have been equally fruitless. Belief\r\nin the presence of any considerable body or bodies within the orbit of\r\nMercury is, accordingly, at a low ebb. Yet the existence of the anomaly\r\nin the Mercurian movements indicated by Leverrier has been made only\r\nsurer by further research.[834] Its elucidation constitutes one of the\r\n\"pending problems\" of astronomy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom the observation at Bologna in 1666-67 of some very faint spots,\r\nDomenico Cassini concluded a rotation or libration of Venus--he was not\r\nsure which--in about twenty-three hours.[835] By Bianchini in 1726 the\r\nperiod was augmented to twenty-four _days_ eight hours. J. J. Cassini,\r\nhowever, in 1740, showed that the data collected by both observers were\r\nconsistent with rotation in twenty-three hours twenty minutes.[836] So\r\nthe matter rested until Schröter's time. After watching nine years in\r\nvain, he at last, February 28, 1788, perceived the ordinarily uniform\r\nbrightness of the planet's disc to be marbled with a filmy streak, which\r\nreturned periodically to the same position in about twenty-three hours\r\ntwenty-eight minutes. This approximate estimate was corrected by the\r\napplication of a more definite criterion. On December 28, 1789, the\r\nsouthern horn of the crescent Venus was seen truncated, an outlying\r\nlucid point interrupting the darkness beyond. Precisely the same\r\nappearance recurred two years later, giving for the planet's rotation a\r\nperiod of 23h. 21m.[837] To this only twenty-two seconds were added by\r\nDe Vico, as the result of over 10,000 observations made with the\r\nCauchoix refractor of the Collegio Romano, 1839-41.[838] The axis of\r\nrotation was found to be much more bowed towards the orbital plane than\r\nthat of the earth, the equator making with it an angle of 53° 11'.\r\n\r\nThese conclusions inspired, it is true, much distrust, consequently\r\nthere were no received ideas on the subject to be subverted.\r\nNevertheless, a shock of surprise was felt at Schiaparelli's\r\nannouncement, early in 1890,[839] that Venus most probably rotates after\r\nthe fashion just previously ascribed to Mercury. A continuous series of\r\nobservations, from November, 1877, to February, 1878, with their records\r\nin above a hundred drawings, supplied the chief part of the data upon\r\nwhich he rested his conclusions. They certainly appeared exceptionally\r\nwell-grounded; and the doubts at first qualifying them were removed by a\r\nfresh set of determinations in July, 1895.[840] Most observers had\r\ndepended, in their attempts to ascertain the rotation-period of Venus,\r\nupon evanescent shadings, most likely of atmospheric origin, and\r\nscarcely recognisable from day to day. Schiaparelli fixed his attention\r\nupon round, defined, lustrously white spots, the presence of which near\r\nthe cusps of the illuminated crescent has been attested for close upon\r\ntwo centuries. His steady watch over them showed the invariability of\r\ntheir position with regard to the terminator; and this is as much as to\r\nsay that the regions of day and night do not shift on the surface of the\r\nplanet. In other words, she keeps the same face always turned towards\r\nthe sun. Moreover, since her orbit is nearly circular, libratory effects\r\nare very small. They amount in fact to only just one-thirtieth of those\r\nserving to modify the severe contrasts of climate in Mercury.\r\n\r\nConfirmatory evidence of Schiaparelli's result for Venus is not wanting.\r\nThus, observations irreconcilable with a swift rate of rotation were\r\nmade at Bothkamp in 1871 by Vogel and Lohse;[841] and a drawing executed\r\nby Professor Holden with the great Washington reflector, December 15,\r\n1877, showed the same markings in the positions recorded at Milan to\r\nhave been occupied by them eight hours previously. Further, a series of\r\nobservations, carried out by M. Perrotin at Nice, May 15 to October 4,\r\n1890, and from Mount Mounier in 1895-6, with the special aim of testing\r\nthe inference of synchronous rotation and revolution, proved strongly\r\ncorroborative of it.[842] A remarkable collection of drawings made by\r\nMr. Lowell in 1896 appeared decisive in its favour;[843] Tacchini at\r\nRome,[844] Mascari at Catania and Etna,[845] Cerulli at Terano,[846]\r\nobtained in 1892-6 evidence similar in purport. On the other hand,\r\nNiesten of Brussels found reason to revert to Vico's discarded elements\r\nfor the planet's rotation;[847] and Trouvelot,[848] Stanley\r\nWilliams,[849] Villiger,[850] and Leo Brenner,[851] so far agreed with\r\nhim as to adopt a period of approximately twenty-four hours. Finally, E.\r\nVon Oppolzer suggested an appeal to the spectroscope;[852] and\r\nBélopolsky secured in 1900[853] spectrograms apparently marked by the\r\nminute displacements corresponding to a rapid rate of axial movement.\r\nBut they were avowedly taken only as an experiment, with unsuitable\r\napparatus; and the desirable verification of their supposed import is\r\nnot yet forthcoming. Until it is, Schiaparelli's period of 225 days must\r\nbe allowed to hold the field.\r\n\r\nEffects attributed to great differences of level in the surface of Venus\r\nhave struck many observers. Francesco Fontana at Naples in 1643 noticed\r\nirregularities along the inner edge of the crescent.[854] Lahire in 1700\r\nconsidered them--regard being had to difference of distance--to be much\r\nmore strongly marked than those visible in the moon.[855] Schröter's\r\nassertions to the same effect, though scouted with some unnecessary\r\nvehemence by Herschel,[856] have since been repeatedly confirmed;\r\namongst others by Mädler, De Vico, Langdon, who in 1873 saw the broken\r\nline of the terminator with peculiar distinctness through a veil of\r\nauroral cloud;[857] by Denning,[858] March 30, 1881, despite preliminary\r\nimpressions to the contrary, as well as by C. V. Zenger at Prague,\r\nJanuary 8, 1883. The great mountain mass, presumed to occasion the\r\nperiodical blunting of the southern horn, was precariously estimated by\r\nthe Lilienthal observer to rise to the prodigious height of nearly\r\ntwenty-seven miles, or just five times the elevation of Mount Everest!\r\nYet the phenomenon persists, whatever may be thought of the explanation.\r\nMoreover, the speck of light beyond, interpreted as the visible sign of\r\na detached peak rising high enough above the encircling shadow to catch\r\nthe first and last rays of the sun, was frequently discerned by Baron\r\nVan Ertborn in 1876;[859] while an object near the northern horn of the\r\ncrescent, strongly resembling a lunar ring-mountain, was delineated both\r\nby De Vico in 1841 and by Denning forty years later.\r\n\r\nWe are almost equally sure that Venus, as that the earth is encompassed\r\nwith an atmosphere. Yet, notwithstanding luminous appearances plainly\r\ndue to refraction during the transits both of 1761 and 1769, Schröter,\r\nin 1792, took the initiative in coming to a definite conclusion on the\r\nsubject.[860] It was founded, first, on the rapid diminution of\r\nbrilliancy towards the terminator, attributed to atmospheric absorption;\r\nnext, on the extension beyond a semicircle of the horns of the crescent;\r\nlastly, on the presence of a bluish gleam illuminating the early hours\r\nof the Cytherean night with what was taken to be genuine twilight. Even\r\nHerschel admitted that sunlight, by the same effect through which the\r\nheavenly bodies show _visibly above_ our horizons while still\r\n_geometrically below_ them, appeared to be bent round the shoulder of\r\nthe globe of Venus. Ample confirmation of the fact has since been\r\nafforded. At Dorpat in May, 1849, the planet being within 3° 26' of\r\ninferior conjunction, Mädler found the arms of waning light upon the\r\ndisc to embrace no less than 240° of its extent;[861] and in December,\r\n1842, Mr. Guthrie, of Bervie, N.B., actually observed, under similar\r\nconditions, the whole circumference to be lit up with a faint nebulous\r\nglow.[862] The same curious phenomenon was intermittently seen by Mr.\r\nLeeson Prince at Uckfield in September, 1861;[863] but with more\r\nsatisfactory distinctness by Mr. C. S. Lyman of Yale College,[864]\r\nbefore and after the conjunction of December 11, 1866, and during nearly\r\nfive hours previous to the transit of 1874, when the yellowish ring of\r\nrefracted light showed at one point an approach to interruption,\r\npossibly through the intervention of a bank of clouds. Again, on\r\nDecember 2, 1898, Venus being 1° 45' from the sun's centre, Mr. H. N.\r\nRussell, of the Halsted Observatory, descried the coalescence of the\r\ncusps, and founded on the observation a valuable discussion of such\r\neffects.[865] Taking account of certain features in the case left\r\nunnoticed by Neison[866] and Proctor,[867] he inferred from them the\r\npresence of a Cytherean atmosphere considerably less refractive than our\r\nown, although possibly, in its lower strata, encumbered with dust or\r\nhaze.\r\n\r\nSimilar appearances are conspicuous during transits. But while the\r\nMercurian halo is characteristically seen on the sun, the \"silver\r\nthread\" round the limb of Venus commonly shows on the part _off_ the\r\nsun. There are, however, instances of each description in both cases.\r\nMr. Grant, in collecting the records of physical phenomena accompanying\r\nthe transits of 1761 and 1769, remarks that no one person saw both kinds\r\nof annulus, and argues a dissimilarity in their respective modes of\r\nproduction.[868] Such a dissimilarity probably exists, in the sense that\r\nthe inner section of the ring is illusory, the outer, a genuine result\r\nof the bending of light in a gaseous envelope; but the distinction of\r\nseparate visibility has not been borne out by recent experience. Several\r\nof the Australian observers during the transit of 1874 witnessed the\r\ncomplete phenomenon. Mr. J. Macdonnell, at Eden, saw a \"shadowy nebulous\r\nring\" surround the whole disc when ingress was two-thirds accomplished;\r\nMr. Tornaghi, at Goulburn, perceived a halo, entire and unmistakable, at\r\nhalf egress.[869] Similar observations were made at Sydney,[870] and\r\nwere renewed in 1882 by Lescarbault at Orgères, by Metzger in Java, and\r\nby Barnard at Vanderbilt University.[871]\r\n\r\nSpectroscopic indications of aqueous vapour as present in the atmosphere\r\nof Venus, were obtained in 1874 and 1882, by Tacchini and Riccò in\r\nItaly, and by Young in New Jersey.[872] Janssen, however, who made a\r\nspecial study of the point subsequently to the transit of 1882, found\r\nthem much less certain than he had anticipated;[873] and Vogel, by\r\nrepeated examinations, 1871-73, could detect only the very slightest\r\nvariations from the pattern of the solar spectrum. Some additions there\r\nindeed seem to be in the thickening of a few water and oxygen-lines; but\r\nso nearly evanescent as to induce the persuasion that most of the light\r\nwe receive from Venus has traversed only the tenuous upper portion of\r\nits atmosphere.[874] It is reflected, at any rate, with comparatively\r\nslight diminution. On the 26th and 27th of September, 1878, a close\r\nconjunction gave Mr. James Nasmyth the rare opportunity of watching\r\nVenus and Mercury for several hours side by side in the field of his\r\nreflector; when the former appeared to him like clean silver, the latter\r\nas dull as lead or zinc.[875] Yet the light _incident_ upon Mercury is,\r\non an average, three and a half times as strong as the light reaching\r\nVenus. Thus, the reflective power of Venus must be singularly strong.\r\nAnd we find, accordingly, from a combination of Zöllner's with Müller's\r\nresults, that its albedo is but little inferior to that of new-fallen\r\nsnow; in other words, it gives back 77 per cent. of the luminous rays\r\nimpinging upon it.\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary brilliancy would be intelligible were it permissible\r\nto suppose that we see nothing of the planet but a dense canopy of\r\nclouds. But the hypothesis is discountenanced by the Flagstaff\r\nobservations, and is irreconcilable with the visibility of mountainous\r\nelevations, and permanent surface-markings. To Mr. Lowell these were so\r\ndistinct and unchanging as to furnish data for a chart of the Cytherean\r\nglobe, and the peculiar arrangement of divergent shading exhibited in it\r\ncannot off-hand be set down as unreal, in view of Perrotin's earlier\r\ndiscernment of analogous linear traces. Gruithuisen's \"snow-caps,\"[876]\r\nhowever--it is safe to say--do not exist as such; although shining\r\nregions near the poles form a well-attested trait of the strange\r\nCytherean landscape.\r\n\r\nThe \"secondary,\" or \"ashen light,\" of Venus was first noticed by\r\nRiccioli in 1643; it was seen by Derham about 1715, by Kirch in 1721, by\r\nSchröter and Harding in 1806;[877] and the reality of the appearance has\r\nsince been authenticated by numerous and trustworthy observations. It is\r\nprecisely similar to that of the \"old moon in the new moon's arms\"; and\r\nZenger, who witnessed it with unusual distinctness, January 8,\r\n1883,[878] supposes it due to the same cause--namely, to the faint gleam\r\nof reflected earth-light from the night-side of the planet. When we\r\nremember, however, that \"full earth-light\" on Venus, at its nearest, has\r\nlittle more than 1/12000 its intensity on the moon, we see at once that\r\nthe explanation is inadequate. Nor can Professor Safarik's,[879] by\r\nphosphorescence of the warm and teeming oceans with which Zöllner[880]\r\nregarded the globe of Venus as mainly covered, be seriously entertained.\r\nVogel's suggestion is more plausible. He and O. Lohse, at Bothkamp,\r\nNovember 3 to 11, 1871, saw the dark hemisphere _partially_ illuminated\r\nby secondary light, extending 30° from the terminator, and thought the\r\neffect might be produced by a very extensive twilight.[881] Others have\r\nhad recourse to the analogy of our auroræ, and J. Lamp suggested that\r\nthe grayish gleam, visible to him at Bothkamp, October 21 and 26,\r\n1887,[882] might be an accompaniment of electrical processes connected\r\nwith the planet's meteorology. Whatever the origin of the phenomenon, it\r\nmay serve, on a night-enwrapt hemisphere, to dissipate some of the thick\r\ndarkness otherwise encroached upon only by \"the pale light of stars.\"\r\n\r\nVenus was once supposed to possess a satellite. But belief in its\r\nexistence has died out. No one, indeed, has caught even a deceptive\r\nglimpse of such an object during the last 125 years. Yet it was\r\nrepeatedly and, one might have thought, well observed in the seventeenth\r\nand eighteenth centuries. Fontana \"discovered\" it in 1645; Cassini--an\r\nadept in the art of seeing--recognised it in 1672, and again in 1686;\r\nShort watched it for a full hour in 1740 with varied instrumental means;\r\nTobias Mayer in 1759, Montaigne in 1761; several astronomers at\r\nCopenhagen in March, 1764, noted what they considered its unmistakable\r\npresence; as did Horrebow in 1768. But M. Paul Stroobant,[883] who in\r\n1887 submitted all the available data on the subject to a searching\r\nexamination, identified Horrebow's satellite with Theta Libræ, a\r\nfifth-magnitude star; and a few other apparitions were, by his industry,\r\nsimilarly explained away. Nevertheless, several withstood all efforts to\r\naccount for them, and together form a most curious case of illusion. For\r\nit is quite certain that Venus has no such conspicuous attendant.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe third planet encountered in travelling outward from the sun is the\r\nabode of man. He has in consequence opportunities for studying its\r\nphysical habitudes altogether different from the baffling glimpse\r\nafforded to him of the other members of the solar family.\r\nRegarding the earth, then, a mass of knowledge so varied and\r\ncomprehensive has been accumulated as to form a science--or rather\r\nseveral sciences--apart. But underneath all lie astronomical relations,\r\nthe recognition and investigation of which constitute one of the most\r\nsignificant intellectual events of the present century.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed far from easy to draw a line of logical distinction between\r\nitems of knowledge which have their proper place here, and those which\r\nshould be left to the historian of geology. There are some, however, of\r\nwhich the cosmical connections are so close that it is impossible to\r\noverlook them. Among these is the ascertainment of the solidity of the\r\nglobe. At first sight it seems difficult to conceive what the apparent\r\npositions of the stars can have to do with subterranean conditions; yet\r\nit was from star measurements alone that Hopkins, in 1839, concluded the\r\nearth to be solid to a depth of at least 800 or 1,000 miles.[884] His\r\nargument was, that if it were a mere shell filled with liquid,\r\nprecession and nutation would be much larger than they are observed to\r\nbe. For the shell alone would follow the pull of the sun and moon on its\r\nequatorial girdle, leaving the liquid behind; and being thus so much the\r\nlighter, would move the more readily. There is, it is true, grave reason\r\nto doubt whether this reasoning corresponds with the actual facts of the\r\ncase;[885] but the conclusion to which it led has been otherwise\r\naffirmed and extended.\r\n\r\nIndications of an identical purport have been derived from another kind\r\nof external disturbance, affecting our globe through the same agencies.\r\nLord Kelvin (then Sir William Thomson) pointed out in 1862[886] that\r\ntidal influences are brought to bear on land as well as on water,\r\nalthough obedience to them is perceptible only in the mobile element.\r\nSome bodily distortion of the earth's figure _must_, however, take\r\nplace, unless we suppose it of absolute or \"preternatural\" rigidity, and\r\nthe amount of such distortion can be determined from its effect in\r\ndiminishing oceanic tides below their calculated value. For if the earth\r\nwere perfectly plastic to the stresses of solar and lunar gravity,\r\ntides--in the ordinary sense--would not exist. Continents and oceans\r\nwould swell and subside together. It is to the _difference_ in the\r\nbehaviour of solid and liquid terrestrial constituents that the ebb and\r\nflow of the waters are due.\r\n\r\nSix years later, the distinguished Glasgow professor suggested that this\r\ncriterion might, by the aid of a prolonged series of exact tidal\r\nobservations, be practically applied to test the interior condition of\r\nour planet.[887] In 1882, accordingly, suitable data extending over\r\nthirty-three years having at length become available, Mr. G. H. Darwin\r\nperformed the laborious task of their analysis, with the general result\r\nthat the \"effective rigidity\" of the earth's mass must be _at least_ as\r\ngreat as that of steel.[888]\r\n\r\nRatification from an unexpected quarter has lately been brought to this\r\nconclusion. The question of a possible mobility in the earth's axis of\r\nrotation has often been mooted. Now at last it has received an\r\naffirmative reply. Dr. Küstner detected, in his observations of 1884-85,\r\neffects apparently springing from a minute variation in the latitude of\r\nBerlin. The matter having been brought before the International Geodetic\r\nAssociation in 1888, special observations were set on foot at Berlin,\r\nPotsdam, Prague, and Strasbourg, the upshot of which was to bring\r\nplainly to view synchronous, and seemingly periodic fluctuations of\r\nlatitude to the extent of half a second of arc. The reality of these was\r\nverified by an expedition to Honolulu in 1891-92, the variations there\r\ncorresponding inversely to those simultaneously determined in\r\nEurope.[889] Their character was completely defined by Mr. S. C.\r\nChandler's discussion in October, 1891.[890] He showed that they could\r\nbe explained by supposing the pole of the earth to describe a circle\r\nwith a radius of thirty feet in a period of fourteen months.\r\nConfirmation of this hypothesis was found by Dr. B. A. Gould in the\r\nCordoba observations,[891] and it was provided with a physical basis\r\nthrough the able co-operation of Professor Newcomb.[892] The earth,\r\nowing to its ellipsoidal shape, should, apart from disturbance, rotate\r\nupon its \"axis of figure,\" or shortest diameter; since thus alone can\r\nthe centrifugal forces generated by its spinning balance each other.\r\nTemporary causes, however, such as heavy falls of snow or rain limited\r\nto one continental area, the shifting of ice-masses, even the movements\r\nof winds, may render the globe slightly lop-sided, and thus oblige it to\r\nforsake its normal axis, and rotate on one somewhat divergent from it.\r\nThis \"instantaneous axis\" (for it is incessantly changing) must, by\r\nmathematical theory, revolve round the axis of figure in a period of 306\r\ndays. Provided, that is to say, the earth were a perfectly rigid body.\r\nBut it is far from being so; it yields sensibly to every strain put upon\r\nit; and this yielding tends to protract the time of circulation of the\r\ndisplaced pole. The length of its period, then, serves as a kind of\r\nmeasure of the plasticity of the globe; which, according to Newcomb's\r\nand S. S. Hough's independent calculations,[893] seems to be a little\r\nless than that of steel. In an earth compacted of steel, the\r\ninstantaneous axis would revolve in 441 days; in the actual earth, the\r\nprocess is accomplished in 428 days. By this new path, accordingly,\r\nastronomers have been led to an identical estimate of the consistence of\r\nour globe with that derived from tidal investigations.\r\n\r\nVariations of latitude are intrinsically complex. To produce them, an\r\nincalculable interplay of causes must be at work, each with its proper\r\nperiod and law of action.[894] All the elements of the phenomenon are\r\nthen in a perpetual state of flux,[895] and absorb for their continual\r\nredetermination, the arduous and combined labours of many astronomers.\r\nNor is this trouble superfluous. Minute in extent though they be, the\r\nshiftings of the pole menace the very foundations of exact celestial\r\nscience; their neglect would leave the entire fabric insecure. Just at\r\nthe beginning of the present century they reached a predicted minimum,\r\nbut are expected again to augment their range after the year 1902. The\r\ninteresting suggestion has been made by Mr. J. Halm that such\r\nfluctuations are, in some obscure way, affected by changes in solar\r\nactivity, and conform like them to an eleven-year cycle.[896]\r\n\r\nIn a paper read before the Geological Society, December 15, 1830,[897]\r\nSir John Herschel threw out the idea that the perplexing changes of\r\nclimate revealed by the geological record might be explained through\r\ncertain slow fluctuations in the eccentricity of the earth's orbit,\r\nproduced by the disturbing action of the other planets. Shortly\r\nafterwards, however, he abandoned the position as untenable;[898] and it\r\nwas left to the late Dr. James Croll, in 1864[899] and subsequent years,\r\nto reoccupy and fortify it. Within restricted limits (as Lagrange and,\r\nmore certainly and definitely, Leverrier proved), the path pursued by\r\nour planet round the sun alternately contracts, in the course of ages,\r\ninto a moderate ellipse, and expands almost to a circle, the major axis,\r\nand consequently the mean distance, remaining invariable. Even at\r\npresent, when the eccentricity approaches a minimum, the sun is nearer\r\nto us in January than in July by above three million miles, and some\r\n850,000 years ago this difference was more than four times as great. Dr.\r\nCroll brought together[900] a mass of evidence to support the view,\r\nthat, at epochs of considerable eccentricity, the hemisphere of which\r\nthe winter, occurring at aphelion, was both intensified and prolonged,\r\nmust have undergone extensive glaciation; while the opposite hemisphere,\r\nwith a short, mild winter, and long, cool summer, enjoyed an approach to\r\nperennial spring. These conditions were exactly reversed at the end of\r\n10,500 years, through the shifting of the perihelion combined with the\r\nprecession of the equinoxes, the frozen hemisphere blooming into a\r\nluxuriant garden as its seasons came round to occur at the opposite\r\nsites of the terrestrial orbit, and the vernal hemisphere subsiding\r\nsimultaneously into ice-bound rigour.[901] Thus a plausible explanation\r\nwas offered of the anomalous alternations of glacial and semi-tropical\r\nperiods, attested, on incontrovertible geological evidence, as having\r\nsucceeded each other in times past over what are now temperate regions.\r\nThey succeeded each other, it is true, with much less frequency and\r\nregularity than the theory demanded; but the discrepancy was overlooked\r\nor smoothed away. The most recent glacial epoch was placed by Dr. Croll\r\nabout 200,000 years ago, when the eccentricity of the earth's orbit was\r\n3·4 times as great as it is now. At present a faint representation of\r\nsuch a state of things is afforded by the southern hemisphere. One\r\ncondition of glaciation in the coincidence of winter with the maximum of\r\nremoteness from the sun, is present; the other--a high eccentricity--is\r\ndeficient. Yet the ring of ice-bound territory hemming in the southern\r\npole is well known to be far more extensive than the corresponding\r\nregion in the north.\r\n\r\nThe verification of this ingenious hypothesis depends upon a variety of\r\nintricate meteorological conditions, some of which have been adversely\r\ninterpreted by competent authorities.[902] What is still more serious,\r\nits acceptance seems precluded by time-relations of a simple kind. Dr.\r\nWright[903] has established with some approach to certainty that glacial\r\nconditions ceased in Canada and the United States about ten or twelve\r\nthousand years ago. The erosive action of the Falls of Niagara qualifies\r\nthem to serve as a clepsydra, or water-clock on a grand scale; and their\r\nchronological indications have been amply corroborated elsewhere and\r\notherwise on the same continent. The astronomical Ice Age, however,\r\nshould have been enormously more antique. No reconciliation of the facts\r\nwith the theory appears possible.\r\n\r\nThe first attempt at an experimental estimate of the \"mean density\" of\r\nthe earth was Maskelyne's observation in 1774 of the deflection of a\r\nplumb-line through the attraction of Schehallien. The conclusion thence\r\nderived, that our globe weighs 4-1/2 times as much as an equal bulk of\r\nwater,[904] was not very exact. It was considerably improved upon by\r\nCavendish, who, in 1798, brought into use the \"torsion-balance\"\r\nconstructed for the same purpose by John Michell. The resulting estimate\r\nof 5·48 was raised to 5·66 by Francis Baily's elaborate repetition of\r\nthe process in 1838-42. From experiments on the subject made in 1872-73\r\nby Cornu and Baille the slightly inferior value of 5·56 was derived; and\r\nit was further shown that the data collected by Baily, when corrected\r\nfor a systematic error, gave practically the same result (5·55).[905] M.\r\nWilsing's of 5·58, obtained at Potsdam in 1889,[906] nearly agreed with\r\nit; while Professor Poynting, by means of a common balance, arrived at a\r\nterrestrial mean density of 5·49.[907] Professor Boys next entered the\r\nfield with an exquisite apparatus, in which a quartz fibre performed the\r\nfunctions of a torsion-rod; and the figure 5·53 determined by him, and\r\nexactly confirmed by Dr. Braun's research at Mariaschein, Bohemia, in\r\n1896,[908] may be called the standard value of the required datum.\r\nNewton's guess at the average weight of the earth as five or six times\r\nthat of water has thus been curiously verified.\r\n\r\nOperations for determining the figure of the earth were carried out during\r\nthe last century on an unprecedented scale. The Russo-Scandinavian arc,\r\nof which the measurement was completed under the direction of the elder\r\nStruve in 1855, reached from Hammerfest to Ismailia on the Danube,\r\na length of 25° 20'. But little inferior to it was the Indian arc, begun\r\nby Lambton in the first years of the century, continued by Everest,\r\nrevised and extended by Walker. Both were surpassed in compass by the\r\nAnglo-French arc, which embraced 28°; and considerable segments of\r\nmeridians near the Atlantic and Pacific shores of North America were\r\nmeasured under the auspices of the United States Coast Survey. But these\r\noperations shrink into insignificance by comparison with Sir David\r\nGill's grandiose scheme for uniting two hemispheres by a continuous\r\nnetwork of triangulation. The history of geodesy in South Africa began\r\nwith Lacaille's measurements in 1752. They were repeated and enlarged in\r\nscope by Sir Thomas Maclear in 1841-48; and his determinations prepared\r\nthe way for a complete survey of Cape Colony and Natal, executed during\r\nthe ten years 1883-92 by Colonel Morris, R.E., under the direction of\r\nSir David Gill.[909] Bechuanaland and Rhodesia were subsequently\r\nincluded in the work; and the Royal Astronomer obtained, in 1900, the\r\nsupport of the International Geodetic Association for its extension to\r\nthe mouth of the Nile. Nor was this the limit of his design. By carrying\r\nthe survey along the Levantine coast, connection can be established with\r\nStruve's system, and the magnificent amplitude of 105° will be given to\r\nthe conjoined African and European arcs. Meantime, the French have\r\nundertaken the remeasurement of Bouguer's Peruvian arc, and a\r\ncorresponding Russo-Swedish[910] enterprise is progressing in\r\nSpitzbergen; so that abundant materials will ere long be provided for\r\nfresh investigations of the shape and size of our planet. The smallness\r\nof the outstanding uncertainty can be judged of by comparing J. B.\r\nListing's[911] with General Clarke's[912] results, published in the same\r\nyear (1878). Listing stated the dimensions of the terrestrial spheroid\r\nas follows: Equatorial radius = 3,960 miles; polar radius = 3,947 miles;\r\nellipticity = 1/288·5. Clarke's corresponding figures were: 3,963 and\r\n3,950 miles, giving an ellipticity of 1/293·5. The value of the latter\r\nfraction at present generally adopted is 1/292; that is to say, the\r\nthickness of the protuberant equatorial ring is held to be 1/292 of the\r\nequatorial radius. From astronomical considerations, it is true, Newcomb\r\nestimated the ratio at 1/308;[913] but for obtaining this particular\r\ndatum, geodetical methods are unquestionably to be preferred.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe moon possesses for us a unique interest. She in all probability\r\nshared the origin of the earth; she perhaps prefigures its decay. She is\r\nat present its minister and companion. Her existence, so far as we can\r\nsee, serves no other purpose than to illuminate the darkness of\r\nterrestrial nights, and to measure, by swiftly-recurring and conspicuous\r\nchanges of aspect, the long span of terrestrial time. Inquiries\r\nstimulated by visible dependence, and aided by relatively close\r\nvicinity, have resulted in a wonderfully minute acquaintance with the\r\nfeatures of the single lunar hemisphere open to our inspection.\r\n\r\nSelenography, in the modern sense, is little more than a hundred years\r\nold. It originated with the publication in 1791 of Schröter's\r\n_Selenotopographische Fragmente_.[914] Not but that the lunar surface\r\nhad already been diligently studied, chiefly by Hevelius, Cassini,\r\nRiccioli, and Tobias Mayer; the idea, however, of investigating the\r\nmoon's physical condition, and detecting symptoms of the activity there\r\nof natural forces through minute topographical inquiry, first obtained\r\neffect at Lilienthal. Schröter's delineations, accordingly, imperfect\r\nthough they were, afforded a starting-point for a _comparative_ study of\r\nthe superficial features of our satellite.\r\n\r\nThe first of the curious objects which he named \"rills\" was noted by him\r\nin 1787. Before 1801 he had found eleven; Lohrmann added 75; Mädler 55;\r\nSchmidt published in 1866 a catalogue of 425, of which 278 had been\r\ndetected by himself;[915] and he eventually brought the number up to\r\nnearly 1,000. They are, then, a very persistent lunar feature, though\r\nwholly without terrestrial analogue. There is no difference of opinion\r\nas to their nature. They are quite obviously clefts in a rocky surface,\r\n100 to 500 yards deep, usually a couple of miles across, and pursuing\r\nstraight, curved, or branching tracks up to 150 miles in length. As\r\nregards their origin, the most probable view is that they are fissures\r\nproduced in cooling; but Neison inclines to consider them rather as\r\ndried watercourses.[916]\r\n\r\nOn February 24, 1792, Schröter perceived what he took to be distinct\r\ntraces of a lunar twilight, and continued to observe them during nine\r\nconsecutive years.[917] They indicated, he thought, the presence of a\r\nshallow atmosphere, about 29 times more tenuous than our own. Bessel, on\r\nthe other hand, considered that the only way of \"saving\" a lunar\r\natmosphere was to deny it any refractive power, the sharpness and\r\nsuddenness of star-occultations negativing the possibility of gaseous\r\nsurroundings of greater density (admitting an extreme supposition) than\r\n1/500 that of terrestrial air.[918] Newcomb places the maximum at 1/400.\r\nSir John Herschel concluded \"the non-existence of any atmosphere at the\r\nmoon's edge having 1/1980 part of the density of the earth's\r\natmosphere.\"[919]\r\n\r\nThis decision was fully borne out by Sir William Huggins's spectroscopic\r\nobservation of the disappearance behind the moon's limb of the small\r\nstar Eta Piscium, January 4, 1865.[920] Not the slightest sign of\r\nselective absorption or unequal refraction was discernible. The entire\r\nspectrum went out at once, as if a slide had suddenly dropped over it.\r\nThe spectroscope has uniformly told the same tale; for M. Thollon's\r\nobservation during the total solar eclipse at Sohag of a supposed\r\nthickening at the moon's rim, of certain dark lines in the solar\r\nspectrum, is now acknowledged to have been illusory. Moonlight, analysed\r\nwith the prism, is found to be pure reflected sunlight, diminished in\r\n_quantity_, owing to the low reflective capability of the lunar surface,\r\nto less than one-fifth its incident intensity, but wholly unmodified in\r\n_quality_.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the diameter of the moon appeared from the Greenwich\r\nobservations discussed by Airy in 1865[921] to be 4\" smaller than when\r\ndirectly measured; and the effect would be explicable by refraction in a\r\nlunar atmosphere 2,000 times thinner than our own at the sea-level. But\r\nthe difference was probably illusory. It resulted in part, if not\r\nwholly, from the visual enlargement by irradiation of the bright disc of\r\nthe moon. Professor Comstock, employing the 16-inch Clark equatoreal of\r\nthe Washburn Observatory, found in 1897 the refractive displacements of\r\nocculted stars so trifling as to preclude the existence of a permanent\r\nlunar atmosphere of much more than 1/5000 the density of the terrestrial\r\nenvelope.[922] The possibility, however, was admitted that, on the\r\nilluminated side of the moon, temporary exhalations of aqueous vapour\r\nmight arise from ice-strata evaporated by sun-heat. Meantime, some\r\nrenewed evidence of actual crepuscular gleams on the moon had been\r\ngathered by MM. Paul and Prosper Henry of the Paris Observatory, as well\r\nas by Mr. W. H. Pickering, in the pure air of Arequipa, at an altitude\r\nof 8,000 feet above the sea.[923] An occultation of Jupiter, too,\r\nobserved by him August 12, 1892,[924] was attended with a slight\r\nflattening of the planet's disc through the effect, it was supposed, of\r\nlunar refraction--but of refraction in an atmosphere possessing, at the\r\nmost, 1/4000 the density at the sea-level of terrestrial air, and\r\ncapable of holding in equilibrium no more than 1/250 of an inch of\r\nmercury. Yet this small barometric value corresponds, Mr. Pickering\r\nremarks, \"to a pressure of hundreds of tons per square mile of the lunar\r\nsurface.\" The compression downward of gaseous strata on the moon should,\r\nin any case, proceed very gradually, owing to the slight power of lunar\r\ngravity,[925] and they might hence play an important part in the economy\r\nof our satellite while evading spectroscopic and other tests. Thus--as\r\nMr. Ranyard remarked[926]--the cliffs and pinnacles of the moon bear\r\nwitness, by their unworn condition, to the efficiency of atmospheric\r\nprotection against meteoric bombardment; and Mr. Pickering shows that it\r\ncould be afforded by such a tenuous envelope as that postulated by him.\r\n\r\nThe first to emulate Schröter's selenographical zeal was Wilhelm\r\nGotthelf Lohrmann, a land-surveyor of Dresden, who, in 1824, published\r\nfour out of twenty-five sections of the first scientifically executed\r\nlunar chart, on a scale of 37-1/2 inches to a lunar diameter. His sight,\r\nhowever, began to fail three years later, and he died in 1840, leaving\r\nmaterials from which the work was completed and published in 1878 by Dr.\r\nJulius Schmidt, late director of the Athens Observatory. Much had been\r\ndone in the interim. Beer and Mädler began at Berlin in 1830 their great\r\ntrigonometrical survey of the lunar surface, as yet neither revised nor\r\nsuperseded. A map, issued in four parts, 1834-36, on nearly the same\r\nscale as Lohrmann's, but more detailed and authoritative, embodied the\r\nresults. It was succeeded, in 1837, by a descriptive volume bearing the\r\nimposing title, _Der Mond; oder allgemeine vergleichende Selenographie_.\r\nThis summation of knowledge in that branch, though in truth leaving many\r\nquestions open, had an air of finality which tended to discourage\r\nfurther inquiry.[927] It gave form to a reaction against the sanguine\r\nviews entertained by Hevelius, Schröter, Herschel and Gruithuisen as to\r\nthe possibilities of agreeable residence on the moon, and relegated the\r\n\"Selenites,\" one of whose cities Schröter thought he had discovered, and\r\nof whose festal processions Gruithuisen had not despaired of becoming a\r\nspectator, to the shadowy land of the Ivory Gate. All examples of change\r\nin lunar formations were, moreover, dismissed as illusory. The light\r\ncontained in the work was, in short, a \"dry light,\" not stimulating to\r\nthe imagination. \"A mixture of a lie,\" Bacon shrewdly remarks, \"doth\r\never add pleasure.\" For many years, accordingly, Schmidt had the field\r\nof selenography almost to himself.\r\n\r\nReviving interest in the subject was at once excited and displayed by\r\nthe appointment, in 1864, of a Lunar Committee of the British\r\nAssociation. The indirect were of greater value than the direct fruits\r\nof its labours. An English school of selenography rose into importance.\r\nPopularity was gained for the subject by the diffusion of works\r\nconspicuous for ingenuity and research. Nasmyth's and Carpenter's\r\nbeautifully illustrated volume (1874) was succeeded, after two years, by\r\na still more weighty contribution to lunar science in Mr. Neison's\r\nwell-known book, accompanied by a map, based on the survey of Beer and\r\nMädler, but adding some 500 measures of positions, besides the\r\nrepresentation of several thousand new objects. With Schmidt's _Charte\r\nder Gebirge der Mondes_, Germany once more took the lead. This splendid\r\ndelineation, built upon Lohrmann's foundation, embraced the detail\r\ncontained in upwards of 3,000 original drawings, representing the labour\r\nof thirty-four years. No less than 32,856 craters are represented in it,\r\non a scale of seventy-five inches to a diameter. An additional help to\r\nlunar inquiries was provided at the same time in this country by the\r\nestablishment, through the initiative of the late Mr. W. R. Birt, of the\r\nSelenographical Society.\r\n\r\nBut the strongest incentive to diligence in studying the rugged features\r\nof our celestial helpmate has been the idea of probable or actual\r\nvariation in them. A change always seems to the inquisitive intellect of\r\nman like a breach in the defences of Nature's secrets, through which it\r\nmay hope to make its way to the citadel. What is desirable easily\r\nbecomes credible; and thus statements and rumours of lunar convulsions\r\nhave successively, during the last hundred years, obtained credence, and\r\nsuccessively, on closer investigation, been rejected. The subject is one\r\nas to which illusion is peculiarly easy. Our view of the moon's surface\r\nis a bird's-eye view. Its conformation reveals itself indirectly through\r\nirregularities in the distribution of light and darkness. The forms of\r\nits elevations and depressions can be inferred only from the shapes of\r\nthe black, unmitigated shadows cast by them. But these shapes are in a\r\nstate of perpetual and bewildering fluctuation, partly through changes\r\nin the angle of illumination, partly through changes in our point of\r\nview, caused by what are called the moon's \"librations.\"[928] The result\r\nis, that no single observation can be _exactly_ repeated by the same\r\nobserver, since identical conditions recur only after the lapse of a\r\ngreat number of years.\r\n\r\nLocal peculiarities of surface, besides, are liable to produce\r\nperplexing effects. The reflection of earth-light at a particular angle\r\nfrom certain bright summits completely, though temporarily, deceived\r\nHerschel into the belief that he had witnessed, in 1783 and 1787,\r\nvolcanic outbursts on the dark side of the moon. The persistent\r\nrecurrence, indeed, of similar appearances under circumstances less\r\namenable to explanation inclined Webb to the view that effusions of\r\nnative light actually occur.[929] More cogent proofs must, however, be\r\nadduced before a fact so intrinsically improbable can be admitted as\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\nBut from the publication of Beer and Mädler's work until 1866, the\r\nreceived opinion was that no genuine sign of activity had ever been\r\nseen, or was likely to be seen, on our satellite; that her face was a\r\nstereotyped page, a fixed and irrevisable record of the past. A profound\r\nsensation, accordingly, was produced by Schmidt's announcement, in\r\nOctober, 1866, that the crater \"Linné,\" in the Mare Serenitatis, had\r\ndisappeared,[930] effaced, as it was supposed, by an igneous outflow.\r\nThe case seemed undeniable, and is still dubious. Linné had been known\r\nto Lohrmann and Mädler, 1822-32, as a deep crater, five or six miles in\r\ndiameter, the third largest in the dusky plain known as the \"Mare\r\nSerenitatis\"; and Schmidt had observed and drawn it, 1840-43, under a\r\npractically identical aspect. Now it appears under high light as a\r\nwhitish spot, in the centre of which, as the rays begin to fall\r\nobliquely, a pit, scarcely two miles across, emerges into view.[931] The\r\ncrateral character of this comparatively minute depression was detected\r\nby Father Secchi, February 11, 1867.\r\n\r\nThis is not all. Schröter's description of Linné, as seen by him\r\nNovember 5, 1788, tallies quite closely with modern observation;[932]\r\nwhile its inconspicuousness in 1797 is shown by its omission from\r\nRussell's lunar globe and maps.[933] We are thus driven to adopt one of\r\ntwo suppositions: either Lohrmann, Mädler, and Schmidt were entirely\r\nmistaken in the size and importance of Linné, or a real change in its\r\noutward semblance supervened during the first half of the century, and\r\nhas since passed away, perhaps again to recur. The latter hypothesis\r\nseems the more probable: and its probability is strengthened by much\r\nevidence of actual obscuration or variation of tint in other parts of\r\nthe lunar surface, more especially on the floor of the great \"walled\r\nplain\" named \"Plato.\"[934] From a re-examination with a 13-inch\r\nrefractor at Arequipa in 1891-92, of this region, and of the Mare\r\nSerenitatis, Mr. W. H. Pickering inclines to the belief that lunar\r\nvolcanic action, once apparently so potent, is not yet wholly\r\nextinct.[935]\r\n\r\nAn instance of an opposite kind of change was alleged by Dr. Hermann J.\r\nKlein of Cologne in March, 1878.[936] In Linné the obliteration of an\r\nold crater had been assumed; in \"Hyginus N.,\" the formation of a new\r\ncrater was asserted. Yet, quite possibly, the same cause may have\r\nproduced the effects thought to be apparent in both. It is, however, far\r\nfrom certain that any real change has affected the neighbourhood of\r\nHyginus. The novelty of Klein's observation of May 19, 1877, may have\r\nconsisted simply in the detection of a hitherto unrecognised feature.\r\nThe region is one of complex formation, consequently of more than\r\nordinary liability to deceptive variations in aspect under rapid and\r\nentangled fluctuations of light and shade.[937] Moreover, it seems to be\r\ncertain, from Messrs. Pratt and Capron's attentive study, that \"Hyginus\r\nN.\" is no true crater, but a shallow, saucer-like depression, difficult\r\nof clear discernment.[938] Under suitable illumination, nevertheless, it\r\ncontains, and is marked by, an ample shadow.[939]\r\n\r\nIn both these controverted instances of change, lunar photography was\r\ninvoked as a witness; but, notwithstanding the great advances made in\r\nthe art by De la Rue in this country, by Draper, and, above all, by\r\nRutherford in America, without decisive results. Investigations of the\r\nkind began to assume a new aspect in 1890, when Professor Holden\r\norganised them at the Lick Observatory.[940] Autographic moon-pictures\r\nwere no longer taken casually, but on system; and Dr. Weinek's elaborate\r\nstudy, and skilful reproductions of them at Prague,[941] gave them\r\nuniversal value. They were designed to provide materials for an atlas on\r\nthe scale of Beer and Mädler's, of which some beautiful specimen-plates\r\nhave been issued. At Paris, in 1894, with the aid of a large \"equatoreal\r\ncoudé,\" a work of similar character was set on foot by MM. Loewy and\r\nPuiseux. Its progress has been marked by the successive publication of\r\nfive instalments of a splendid atlas, on a scale of about eight feet to\r\nthe lunar diameter, accompanied by theoretical dissertations, designed\r\nto establish a science of \"selenology.\" The moon's formations are thus\r\nnot only delineated under every variety of light-incidence, but their\r\nmeaning is sought to be elicited, and their history and mutual relations\r\ninterpreted.[942] Henceforth, at any rate, the lunar volcanoes can\r\nscarcely, without notice taken, breathe hard in their age-long sleep.\r\n\r\nMelloni was the first to get undeniable heating effects from moonlight.\r\nHis experiments, made on Mount Vesuvius early in 1846,[943] were\r\nrepeated with like result by Zantedeschi at Venice four years later. A\r\nrough measure of the intensity of those effects was arrived at by Piazzi\r\nSmyth at Guajara, on the Peak of Teneriffe, in 1856. At a distance of\r\nfifteen feet from the thermomultiplier, a Price's candle was found to\r\nradiate just twice as much heat as the full moon.[944] Then, after\r\nthirteen years, in 1869-72, an exact and extensive series of\r\nobservations on the subject were made by the present Earl of Rosse. The\r\nlunar radiations, from the first to the last quarter, displayed, when\r\nconcentrated with the Parsonstown three-foot mirror, appreciable thermal\r\nenergy, increasing with the phase, and largely due to \"dark heat,\"\r\ndistinguished from the quicker-vibrating sort by inability to traverse a\r\nplate of glass. This was supposed to indicate an actual heating of the\r\nsurface, during the long lunar day of 300 hours, to about 500° F.[945]\r\n(corrected later to 197°),[946] the moon thus acting as a direct\r\nradiator no less than as a reflector of heat. But the conclusion was\r\nvery imperfectly borne out by Dr. Boeddicker's observations with the\r\nsame instrument and apparatus during the total lunar eclipse of October\r\n4, 1884.[947] This initial opportunity of measuring the heat phases of\r\nan eclipsed moon was used with the remarkable result of showing that the\r\nheat disappeared almost completely, though not quite simultaneously,\r\nwith the light. Confirmatory evidence of the extraordinary promptitude\r\nwith which our satellite parts with heat already to some extent\r\nappropriated, was afforded by Professor Langley's bolometric\r\nobservations at Allegheny of the partial eclipse of September 23,\r\n1885.[948] Yet it is certain that the moon sends us a perceptible\r\nquantity of heat _on its own account_, besides simply throwing back\r\nsolar radiations. For in February, 1885, Professor Langley succeeded,\r\nafter many fruitless attempts, in getting measures of a \"lunar\r\nheat-spectrum.\" The incredible delicacy of the operation may be judged\r\nof from the statement that the sum-total of the thermal energy dispersed\r\nby his rock-salt prisms was insufficient to raise a thermometer fully\r\nexposed to it one-thousandth of a degree Centigrade! The singular fact\r\nwas, however, elicited that this almost evanescent spectrum is made up\r\nof two superposed spectra, one due to reflection, the other, with a\r\nmaximum far down in the infra-red, to radiation.[949] The corresponding\r\ntemperature of the moon's sunlit surface Professor Langley considers to\r\nbe about that of freezing water.[950] Repeated experiments having failed\r\nto get any thermal effects from the dark part of the moon, it was\r\ninferred that our satellite \"has no internal heat sensible at the\r\nsurface\"; so that the radiations from the lunar soil giving the low\r\nmaximum in the heat-spectrum, \"must be due purely to solar heat which\r\nhas been absorbed and almost immediately re-radiated.\" Professor\r\nLangley's explorations of the terra incognita of immensely long\r\nwave-lengths where lie the unseen heat-emissions from the earth into\r\nspace, led him to the discovery that these, contrary to the received\r\nopinion, are in good part transmissible by our atmosphere, although they\r\nare completely intercepted by glass. Another important result of the\r\nAllegheny work was the abolition of the anomalous notion of the\r\n\"temperature of space,\" fixed by Pouillet at -140° C. For space in\r\nitself can have no temperature, and stellar radiation is a negligible\r\nquantity. Thus, it is safe to assume \"that a perfect thermometer\r\nsuspended in space at the distance of the earth or moon from the sun,\r\nbut shielded from its rays, would sensibly indicate the absolute\r\nzero,\"[951] ordinarily placed at -273° C.\r\n\r\nA \"Prize Essay on the Distribution of the Moon's Heat\" (The Hague),\r\n1891, by Mr. Frank W. Very, who had taken an active part in Professor\r\nLangley's long-sustained inquiry, embodies the fruits of its\r\ncontinuation. They show the lunar disc to be tolerably uniform in\r\nthermal power. The brighter parts are also indeed hotter, but not much.\r\nThe traces perceived of a slight retention of heat by the substances\r\nforming the lunar surface, agreed well with the Parsonstown observations\r\nof the total eclipse of the moon, January 28, 1888.[952] For they\r\nbrought out an unmistakable divergence between the heat and light\r\nphases. A curious decrease of heat previous to the first touch of the\r\nearth's shadow upon the lunar globe remains unexplained, unless it be\r\nadmissible to suppose the terrestrial atmosphere capable of absorbing\r\nheat at an elevation of 190 miles. The probable range of temperature on\r\nthe moon was discussed by Professor Very in 1898.[953] He concluded it\r\nto be very wide. Hotter than boiling water under the sun's vertical\r\nrays, the arid surface of our dependent globe must, he found, cool in\r\nthe 14-day lunar night to about the temperature of liquid air.\r\n\r\nAlthough that fundamental part of astronomy known as \"celestial\r\nmechanics\" lies outside the scope of this work, and we therefore pass\r\nover in silence the immense labours of Plana, Damoiseau, Hansen,\r\nDelaunay, G. W. Hill, and Airy in reconciling the observed and\r\ncalculated motions of the moon, there is one slight but significant\r\ndiscrepancy which is of such importance to the physical history of the\r\nsolar system, that some brief mention must be made of it.\r\n\r\nHalley discovered in 1693, by examining the records of ancient eclipses,\r\nthat the moon was going faster then than 2,000 years previously--so much\r\nfaster, as to have got ahead of the place in the sky she would otherwise\r\nhave occupied, by about two of her own diameters. It was one of\r\nLaplace's highest triumphs to have found an explanation of this puzzling\r\nfact. He showed, in 1787, that it was due to a very slow change in the\r\novalness of the earth's orbit, tending, during the present age of the\r\nworld, to render it more nearly circular. The pull of the sun upon the\r\nmoon is thereby lessened; the counter-pull of the earth gets the upper\r\nhand; and our satellite, drawn nearer to us by something less than an\r\ninch each year,[954] proportionately quickens her pace. Many thousands\r\nof years hence the process will be reversed; the terrestrial orbit will\r\nclose in at the sides, the lunar orbit will open out under the growing\r\nstress of solar gravity, and our celestial chronometer will lose instead\r\nof gaining time.\r\n\r\nThis is all quite true as Laplace put it; but it is not enough. Adams,\r\nthe virtual discoverer of Neptune, found with surprise in 1853 that the\r\nreceived account of the matter was \"essentially incomplete,\" and\r\nexplained, when the requisite correction was introduced, only half the\r\nobserved acceleration.[955] What was to be done with the remaining half?\r\nHere Delaunay, the eminent French mathematical astronomer, unhappily\r\ndrowned at Cherbourg in 1872 by the capsizing of a pleasure-boat, came\r\nto the rescue.[956]\r\n\r\nIt is obvious to anyone who considers the subject a little attentively,\r\nthat the tides must act to some extent as a friction-brake upon the\r\nrotating earth. In other words, they must bring about an almost\r\ninfinitely slow lengthening of the day. For the two masses of water\r\npiled up by lunar influence on the hither and farther sides of our\r\nglobe, strive, as it were, to detach themselves from the unity of the\r\nterrestrial spheroid, and to follow the movements of the moon. The moon,\r\naccordingly, holds them _against_ the whirling earth, which revolves\r\nlike a shaft in a fixed collar, slowly losing motion and gaining heat,\r\neventually dissipated through space.[957] This must go on (so far as we\r\ncan see) until the periods of the earth's rotation and of the moon's\r\nrevolution coincide. Nay, the process will be continued--should our\r\noceans survive so long--by the feebler tide-raising power of the sun,\r\nceasing only when day and night cease to alternate, when one side of our\r\nplanet is plunged in perpetual darkness and the other seared by\r\nunchanging light.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have the secret of the moon's turning always the same\r\nface towards the earth. It is that in primeval times, when the moon was\r\nliquid or plastic, an earth-raised tidal wave rapidly and forcibly\r\nreduced her rotation to its present exact agreement with her period of\r\nrevolution. This was divined by Kant[958] nearly a century before the\r\nnecessity for such a mode of action presented itself to any other\r\nthinker. In a weekly paper published at Königsberg in 1754, the modern\r\ndoctrine of \"tidal friction\" was clearly outlined by him, both as\r\nregards its effects actually in progress on the rotation of the earth,\r\nand as regards its effects already consummated on the rotation of the\r\nmoon--the whole forming a preliminary attempt at what he called a\r\n\"natural history\" of the heavens. His sagacious suggestion, however,\r\nremained entirely unnoticed until revived--it would seem\r\nindependently--by Julius Robert Mayer in 1848;[959] while similar, and\r\nprobably original, conclusions were reached by William Ferrel of\r\nAllensville, Kentucky, in 1858.[960]\r\n\r\nDelaunay was not then the inventor or discoverer of tidal friction; he\r\nmerely displayed it as an effective cause of change. He showed reason\r\nfor believing that its action in checking the earth's rotation, far from\r\nbeing, as Ferrel had supposed, completely neutralised by the contraction\r\nof the globe through cooling, was a fact to be reckoned with in\r\ncomputing the movements, as well as in speculating on the history, of\r\nthe heavenly bodies. The outstanding acceleration of the moon was thus\r\nat once explained. It was explained as apparent only--the reflection of\r\na real lengthening, by one second in 100,000 years, of the day. But on\r\nthis point the last word has not yet been spoken.\r\n\r\nProfessor Newcomb undertook in 1870 the onerous task of investigating\r\nthe errors of Hansen's Lunar Tables as compared with observations prior\r\nto 1750. The results, published in 1878,[961] proved somewhat\r\nperplexing. They tend, in general, to reduce the amount of acceleration\r\nleft unaccounted for by Laplace's gravitational theory, and\r\nproportionately to diminish the importance of the part played by tidal\r\nfriction. But, in order to bring about this diminution, and at the same\r\ntime conciliate Alexandrian and Arabian observations, it is necessary to\r\nreject _as total_ the ancient solar eclipses known as those of Thales\r\nand Larissa. This may be a necessary, but it must be admitted to be a\r\nhazardous expedient. Its upshot was to indicate a possibility that the\r\nobserved and calculated values of the moon's acceleration might after\r\nall prove to be identical; and the small outstanding discrepancy was\r\nstill further diminished by Tisserand's investigation, differently\r\nconducted, of the same Arabian eclipses discussed by Newcomb.[962] The\r\nnecessity of having recourse to a lengthening day is then less pressing\r\nthan it seemed some time ago; and the effect, if perceptible in the\r\nmoon's motion, should, M. Tisserand remarked, be proportionately so in\r\nthe motions of all the other heavenly bodies. The presence of the\r\napparent general acceleration that should ensue can be tested with most\r\npromise of success, according to the same authority, by delicate\r\ncomparisons of past and future transits of Mercury.\r\n\r\nNewcomb further showed that small residual irregularities are still\r\nfound in the movements of our satellite, inexplicable either by any\r\nknown gravitational influence, or by any _uniform_ value that could be\r\nassigned to secular acceleration.[963] If set down to the account of\r\nimperfections in the \"time-keeping\" of the earth, it could only be on\r\nthe arbitrary supposition of fluctuations in its rate of going\r\nthemselves needing explanation. This, it is true, might be found in very\r\nslight changes of figure,[964] not altogether unlikely to occur. But\r\ninto this cloudy and speculative region astronomers for the present\r\ndecline to penetrate. They prefer, if possible, to deal only with\r\ncalculable causes, and thus to preserve for their \"most perfect of\r\nsciences\" its special prerogative of assured prediction.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 796: _Neueste Beyträge zur Erweiterung der Sternkunde_, Bd.\r\niii., p. 14 (1800).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 797: _Ibid._, p. 24.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 798: _Phil.

The\r\ncircumstance lends a particular interest to inquiries into the physical\r\nhabitudes of our exterior planetary neighbour.\r\n\r\nFontana first caught glimpses, at Naples in 1636 and 1638,[966] of dusky\r\nstains on the ruddy disc of Mars. They were next seen by Hooke and\r\nCassini in 1666, and this time with sufficient distinctness to serve as\r\nindexes to the planet's rotation, determined by the latter as taking\r\nplace in a period of twenty-four hours forty minutes.[967] Increased\r\nconfidence was given to this result through Maraldi's precise\r\nverification of it in 1719.[968] Among the spots observed by him, he\r\ndistinguished two as stable in position, though variable in size. They\r\nwere of a peculiar character, showing as bright patches round the poles,\r\nand had already been noticed during sixty years back. A current\r\nconjecture of their snowy nature obtained validity when Herschel\r\nconnected their fluctuations in extent with the progress of the Martian\r\nseasons. The inference of frozen precipitations could scarcely be\r\nresisted when once it was clearly perceived that the shining polar zones\r\ndid actually by turns diminish and grow with the alternations of summer\r\nand winter in the corresponding hemisphere.\r\n\r\nThis, it may be said, was the opening of our acquaintance with the state\r\nof things prevailing on the surface of Mars. It was accompanied by a\r\nsteady assertion, on Herschel's part, of permanence in the dark\r\nmarkings, notwithstanding partial obscurations by clouds and vapours\r\nfloating in a \"considerable but moderate atmosphere.\" Hence the presumed\r\ninhabitants of the planet were inferred to \"probably enjoy a situation\r\nin many respects similar to ours.\"[969]\r\n\r\nSchröter, on the other hand, went altogether wide of the truth as\r\nregards Mars. He held that the surface visible to us is a mere shell of\r\ndrifting cloud, deriving a certain amount of apparent stability from the\r\ninfluence on evaporation and condensation of subjacent but unseen\r\nareographical features;[970] and his opinion prevailed with his\r\ncontemporaries. It was, however, rejected by Kunowsky in 1822, and\r\nfinally overthrown by Beer and Mädler's careful studies during five\r\nconsecutive oppositions, 1830-39. They identified at each the same dark\r\nspots, frequently blurred with mists, especially when the local winter\r\nprevailed, but fundamentally unchanged.[971] In 1862 Lockyer established\r\na \"marvellous agreement\" with Beer and Mädler's results of 1830, leaving\r\nno doubt as to the complete fixity of the main features, amid \"daily,\r\nnay, hourly,\" variations of detail through transits of clouds.[972] On\r\nseventeen nights of the same opposition, F. Kaiser of Leyden obtained\r\ndrawings in which nearly all the markings noted in 1830 at Berlin\r\nreappeared, besides spots frequently seen respectively by Arago in 1813,\r\nby Herschel in 1783, and one sketched by Huygens in 1672 with a\r\nwriting-pen in his diary.[973] From these data the Leyden observer\r\narrived at a period of rotation of 24h. 37m. 22·62s., being just one\r\nsecond shorter than that deduced, exclusively from their own\r\nobservations, by Beer and Mädler. The exactness of this result was\r\npractically confirmed by the inquiries of Professor Bakhuyzen of\r\nLeyden.[974] Using for a middle term of comparison the disinterred\r\nobservations of Schröter, with those of Huygens at one, and of\r\nSchiaparelli at the other end of an interval of 220 years, he was\r\nenabled to show, with something like certainty, that the time of\r\nrotation (24h. 37m. 22·735s.) ascribed to Mars by Mr. Proctor[975] in\r\nreliance on a drawing executed by Hooke in 1666, was too long by _nearly\r\none-tenth of a second_. The minuteness of the correction indicates the\r\nnicety of care employed. Nor employed vainly; for, owing to the\r\ncomparative antiquity of the records available in this case, an almost\r\ninfinitesimal error becomes so multiplied by frequent repetition as to\r\nproduce palpable discrepancies in the positions of the markings at\r\ndistant dates. Hence Bakhuyzen's period of 24h. 37m. 22·66s. is\r\nundoubtedly of a precision unapproached as regards any other heavenly\r\nbody save the earth itself.\r\n\r\nTwo facts bearing on the state of things at the surface of Mars were,\r\nthen, fully acquired to science in or before the year 1862. The first\r\nwas that of the seasonal fluctuations of the polar spots; the second,\r\nthat of the general permanence of certain dark gray or greenish patches,\r\nperceived with the telescope as standing out from the deep yellow ground\r\nof the disc. That these varieties of tint correspond to the real\r\ndiversities of a terraqueous globe, the \"ripe cornfield\"[976] sections\r\nrepresenting land, the dusky spots and streaks, oceans and straits, has\r\nlong been the prevalent opinion. Sir J. Herschel in 1830 led the way in\r\nascribing the redness of the planet's light to an inherent peculiarity\r\nof soil.[977] Previously it had been assimilated to our sunset glows\r\nrather than to our red sandstone formations--set down, that is, to an\r\natmospheric stoppage of blue rays. But the extensive Martian atmosphere,\r\nimplicitly believed in on the strength of some erroneous observations by\r\nCassini and Römer in the seventeenth century, vanished before the sharp\r\noccultation of a small star in Leo, witnessed by Sir James South in\r\n1822;[978] and Dawes's observation in 1865,[979] that the ruddy tinge is\r\ndeepest near the central parts of the disc, certified its\r\nnon-atmospheric origin. The absolute whiteness of the polar snow-caps\r\nwas alleged in support of the same inference by Sir William Huggins in\r\n1867.[980]\r\n\r\nAll recent operations tend to show that the atmosphere of Mars is much\r\nthinner than our own. This was to have been expected _à priori_, since\r\nthe same proportionate mass of air would on his smaller globe form a\r\nrelatively sparse covering.[981] Besides, gravity there possesses less\r\nthan four-tenths its force here, so that this sparser covering would\r\nweigh less, and be less condensed, than if it enveloped the earth.\r\nAtmospheric pressure would accordingly be of about two and a quarter,\r\ninstead of fifteen terrestrial pounds per square inch. This corresponds\r\nwith what the telescope shows us. It is extremely doubtful whether any\r\nfeatures of the earth's actual surface could be distinguished by a\r\nplanetary spectator, however well provided with optical assistance.\r\nProfessor Langley's inquiries[982] led him to conclude that fully twice\r\nas much light is absorbed by our air as had previously been\r\nsupposed--say 40 per cent. of vertical rays in a clear sky. Of the sixty\r\nreaching the earth, less than a quarter would be reflected even from\r\nwhite sandstone; and this quarter would again pay heavy toll in escaping\r\nback to space. Thus not more than perhaps ten or twelve out of the\r\noriginal hundred sent by the sun would, under the most favourable\r\ncircumstances, and from the very centre of the earth's disc, reach the\r\neye of a Martian or lunar observer. The light by which he views our\r\nworld is, there is little doubt, light reflected from the various strata\r\nof our atmosphere, cloud or mist-laden or serene, as the case may be,\r\nwith an occasional snow-mountain figuring as a permanent white spot.\r\n\r\nThis consideration at once shows us how much more tenuous the Martian\r\nair must be, since it admits of topographical delineations of the\r\nMartian globe. The clouds, too, that form in it seem in general to be\r\nrather of the nature of ground-mists than of heavy cumulus.[983]\r\nOccasionally, indeed, durable and extensive strata become visible.\r\nDuring the latter half of October, 1894, for instance, a region as large\r\nas Europe remained apparently cloud-covered. Yet most recent observers\r\nare unable to detect the traces of aqueous absorption in the Martian\r\nspectrum noted by Huggins in 1867[984] and by Vogel in 1873.[985]\r\nCampbell vainly looked for them,[986] visually in 1894,\r\nspectrographically in 1896; Keeler was equally unsuccessful;[987]\r\nJewell[988] holds that they could, with present appliances, only be\r\nperceived if the atmosphere of Mars were much richer in water-vapour\r\nthan that of the earth. There can be little doubt, however, that its\r\nsupply is about the minimum adequate to the needs of a _living_, and\r\nperhaps a life-nuturing planet.\r\n\r\nThe climate of Mars seems to be unexpectedly mild. Its _theoretical_\r\nmean temperature, taking into account both distance from the sun and\r\nalbedo, is 34° C. below freezing.[989] Yet its polar snows are both less\r\nextensive and less permanent than those on the earth. The southern white\r\nhood, noticed by Schiaparelli in 1877 to have survived the summer only\r\nas a small lateral patch, melted completely in 1894. Moreover, Mr. W. H.\r\nPickering observed with astonishment the disappearance, in the course of\r\nthirty-three days of June and July, 1892, of 1,600,000 square miles of\r\nsouthern snow.[990] Curiously enough, the initial stage of shrinkage in\r\nthe white calotte was marked by its division into two unequal parts, as\r\nif in obedience to the mysterious principle of duplication governing so\r\nmany Martian phenomena.[991] Changes of the hues associated respectively\r\nwith land and water accompanied in lower latitudes, and were thought to\r\nbe occasioned by floods ensuing upon this rapid antarctic thaw. It is\r\ntrue that scarcity of moisture would account for the scantiness and\r\ntransitoriness of snowy deposits easily liquefied because thinly spread.\r\nBut we might expect to see the whole wintry hemisphere, at any rate,\r\nfrost-bound, since the sun radiates less than half as much heat on Mars\r\nas on the earth. Water seems, nevertheless, to remain, as a rule,\r\nuncongealed everywhere outside the polar regions. We are at a loss to\r\nimagine by what beneficent arrangement the rigorous conditions naturally\r\nto be looked for can be modified into a climate which might be found\r\ntolerable by creatures constituted like ourselves.\r\n\r\nMartian topography may be said to form nowadays a separate\r\nsub-department of descriptive astronomy. The amount of detail become\r\nlegible by close scrutiny on a little disc which, once in fifteen years,\r\nattains a maximum of about 1/5000 the area of the full moon, must excite\r\nsurprise and might provoke incredulity. Spurious discoveries, however,\r\nhave little chance of holding their own where there are so many\r\ncompetitors quite as ready to dispute as to confirm.\r\n\r\nThe first really good map of Mars was constructed in 1869 by Proctor\r\nfrom drawings by Dawes. Kaiser of Leyden followed in 1872 with a\r\nrepresentation founded upon data of his own providing in 1862-64; and\r\nTerby, in his valuable _Aréographie_, presented to the Brussels Academy\r\nin 1873[992] a careful discussion of all important observations from the\r\ntime of Fontana downwards, thus virtually adding to knowledge by\r\nsummarising and digesting it. The memorable opposition of September 5,\r\n1877, marked a fresh epoch in the study of Mars. While executing a\r\ntrigonometrical survey (the first attempted) of the disc, then of the\r\nunusual size of 25\" across, G. V. Schiaparelli, director of the Milan\r\nObservatory, detected a novel and curious feature. What had been taken\r\nfor Martian continents were found to be, in point of fact,\r\nagglomerations of islands, separated from each other by a network of\r\nso-called \"canals\" (more properly _channels_).[993] These are obviously\r\nextensions of the \"seas,\" originating and terminating in them, and\r\nsharing their gray-green hue, but running sometimes to a length of three\r\nor four thousand miles in a straight line, and preserving throughout a\r\nnearly uniform breadth of about sixty miles. Further inquiries have\r\nfully substantiated the discovery made at the Brera Observatory. The\r\n\"canals\" of Mars are an actually existent and permanent phenomenon. An\r\nexamination of the drawings in his possession showed M. Terby that they\r\nhad been seen, though not distinctively recognised, by Dawes, Secchi,\r\nand Holden; several were independently traced out by Burton at the\r\nopposition of 1879; all were recovered by Schiaparelli himself in 1879\r\nand 1881-82; and their indefinite multiplication resulted from Lovell's\r\nobservations in 1894 and 1896.\r\n\r\nWhen the planet culminated at midnight, and was therefore in opposition,\r\nDecember 26, 1881, its distance was greater, and its apparent diameter\r\nless than in 1877, in the proportion of sixteen to twenty-five. Its\r\natmosphere was, however, more transparent, and ours of less impediment\r\nto northern observers, the object of scrutiny standing considerably\r\nhigher in northern skies. Never before, at any rate, had the true aspect\r\nof Mars come out so clearly as at Milan, with the 8-3/4-inch Merz\r\nrefractor of the observatory, between December, 1881, and February,\r\n1882. The canals were all again there, but this time they were--in as\r\nmany as twenty cases--_seen in duplicate_. That is to say, a twin-canal\r\nran parallel to the original one at an interval of 200 to 400\r\nmiles.[994]\r\n\r\nWe are here brought face to face with an apparently insoluble enigma.\r\nSchiaparelli regards the \"germination\" of his canals as a periodical\r\nphenomenon depending on the Martian seasons. It is, assuredly, not an\r\nillusory one, since it was plainly apparent, during the opposition of\r\n1886, to MM. Perrotin and Thollon at Nice,[995] and to the former, using\r\nthe new 30-inch refractor of that observatory, in 1888; Mr. A. Stanley\r\nWilliams, with the help of only a 6-1/2-inch reflector, distinctly\r\nperceived in 1890 seven of the duplicate objects noted at Milan,[996]\r\nand the Lick observations, both of 1890 and of 1892, together with the\r\ndrawings made at Flagstaff and Mexico during the last favourable\r\noppositions of the nineteenth century, brought unequivocal confirmation\r\nto the accuracy of Schiaparelli's impressions.[997] Various conjectures\r\nhave been hazarded in explanation of this bizarre appearance. The\r\ndifficulty of conceiving a physical reality corresponding to it has\r\nsuggested recourse to an optical rationale. Proctor regarded it as an\r\neffect of diffraction;[998] Stanislas Meunier, of oblique reflection\r\nfrom overlying mist-banks;[999] Flammarion considers it possible that\r\ncompanion-canals might, under special circumstances, be evoked by\r\nrefraction as a kind of mirage.[1000] But none of these speculations are\r\nreally admissible, when all the facts are taken into account. The view\r\nthat the canals of Mars are vast rifts due to the cooling of the globe,\r\nis recommended by the circumstance that they tend to follow great\r\ncircles; nevertheless, it would break down if, as Schiaparelli holds,\r\nthe fluctuations in their visibility depend upon actual obliterations\r\nand re-emergencies. Fantastic though the theory of their artificial\r\norigin appear, it is held by serious astronomers. Its vogue is largely\r\ndue to Mr. Lowell's ingenious advocacy. He considers the Martian globe\r\nto be everywhere intersected by an elaborate system of irrigation-works,\r\nrendered necessary by a perennial water-famine, relieved periodically by\r\nthe melting of the polar snows. Nor does he admit the existence of\r\noceans, or lakes. What have been taken for such are really tracts\r\ncovered with vegetation, the bright areas intermixed with them\r\nrepresenting sandy deserts. And it is noteworthy in this connection that\r\nProfessor Barnard obtained in 1894,[1001] with the great Lick refractor,\r\n\"suggestive and impressive views\" disclosing details of light and shade\r\non the gray-green patches so intricate and minute as almost to preclude\r\nthe supposition of their aqueous nature.\r\n\r\nThe closeness of the terrestrial analogy has thus of late been much\r\nimpaired. Even if the surface of Mars be composed of land and water,\r\ntheir distribution must be of a completely original type. The\r\ninterlacing everywhere of continents with arms of the sea (if that be\r\nthe correct interpretation of the visual effects) implies that their\r\nlevels scarcely differ;[1002] and Schiaparelli carries most observers\r\nwith him in holding that their outlines are not absolutely constant,\r\nencroachments of dusky upon bright tints suggesting extensive\r\ninundations.[1003] The late N. E. Green's observations at Madeira in\r\n1877 indicated, on the other hand, a rugged south polar region. The\r\ncontour of the snow-cap not only appeared indented, as if by valleys and\r\npromontories, but brilliant points were discerned outside the white\r\narea, attributed to isolated snow-peaks.[1004] Still more elevated, if\r\nsimilarly explained, must be the \"ice island\" first seen in a\r\ncomparatively low latitude by Dawes in January, 1865.\r\n\r\nOn August 4, 1892, Mars stood opposite to the sun at a distance of only\r\n34,865,000 miles from the earth. In point of vicinity, then, its\r\nsituation was scarcely less favourable than in 1877. The low altitude of\r\nthe planet, however, practically neutralised this advantage for northern\r\nobservers, and public expectation, which had been raised to the highest\r\npitch by the announcements of sensation-mongers, was somewhat\r\ndisappointed at the \"meagreness\" of the news authentically received from\r\nMars. Valuable series of observations were, nevertheless, made at Lick\r\nand Arequipa; and they unite in testifying to the genuine prevalence of\r\nsurface-variability, especially in certain regions of intermediate tint,\r\nand perhaps of the \"crude consistence\" of \"boggy Syrtes, neither sea,\r\nnor good dry land.\" Professor Holden insisted on the \"enormous\r\ndifficulties in the way of completely explaining the recorded phenomena\r\nby terrestrial analogies\";[1005] Mr. W. H. Pickering spoke of\r\n\"conspicuous and startling changes.\" They, however, merely overlaid, and\r\npartially disguised, a general stability. Among the novelties detected\r\nby Mr. Pickering were a number of \"lakes,\" or \"oases\" (in Lowell's\r\nphraseology), under the aspect of black dots at the junctions of two or\r\nmore canals;[1006] and he, no less than the Lick astronomers and M.\r\nPerrotin at Nice,[1007] observed brilliant clouds projecting beyond the\r\nterminator, or above the limb, while carried round by the planet's\r\nrotation. They seemed to float at an altitude of at least twenty miles,\r\nor about four times the height of terrestrial cirrus; but this was not\r\nwonderful, considering the low power of gravity acting upon them. Great\r\ncapital was made in the journalistic interest out of these imaginary\r\nsignals from intelligent Martians, desirous of opening communications\r\nwith (to them) problematical terrestrial beings. Similar effects had,\r\nhowever, been seen before by Mr. Knobel in 1873, by M. Terby in 1888,\r\nand at the Lick Observatory in 1890; and they were discerned again with\r\nparticular distinctness by Professor Hussey at Lick, August 27,\r\n1896.[1008]\r\n\r\nThe first photograph of Mars was taken by Gould at Cordoba in 1879.\r\nLittle real service in planetary delineation has, it is true, been so\r\nfar rendered by the art, yet one achievement must be recorded to its\r\ncredit. A set of photographs obtained by Mr. W. H. Pickering on Wilson's\r\nPeak, California, April 9, 1890, showed the southern polar cap of Mars\r\nas of moderate dimensions, but with a large dim adjacent area.\r\nTwenty-four hours later, on a corresponding set, the dim area was\r\nbrilliantly white. The polar cap had become enlarged in the interim,\r\napparently through a wide-spreading snow-fall, by the annexation of a\r\nterritory equal to that of the United States. The season was towards the\r\nclose of winter in Mars. Never until then had the process of glacial\r\nextension been actually (it might be said) superintended in that distant\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\nMars was gratuitously supplied with a pair of satellites long before he\r\nwas found actually to possess them. Kepler interpreted Galileo's anagram\r\nof the \"triple\" Saturn in this sense; they were perceived by Micromégas\r\non his long voyage through space; and the Laputan astronomers had even\r\narrived at a knowledge, curiously accurate under the circumstances, of\r\ntheir distances and periods. But terrestrial observers could see nothing\r\nof them until the night of August 11, 1877. The planet was then within\r\none month of its second nearest approach to the earth during the last\r\ncentury; and in 1845 the Washington 26-inch refractor was not in\r\nexistence.[1009] Professor Asaph Hall, accordingly, determined to turn\r\nthe conjecture to account for an exhaustive inquiry into the\r\nsurroundings of Mars. Keeping his glaring disc just outside the field of\r\nview, a minute attendant speck of light was \"glimpsed\" August 11. Bad\r\nweather, however, intervened, and it was not until the 16th that it was\r\nascertained to be what it appeared--a satellite. On the following\r\nevening a second, still nearer to the primary, was discovered, which, by\r\nthe bewildering rapidity of its passages hither and thither, produced at\r\nfirst the effect of quite a crowd of little moons.[1010]\r\n\r\nBoth these delicate objects have since been repeatedly observed, both in\r\nEurope and America, even with comparatively small instruments. At the\r\nopposition of 1884, indeed, the distance of the planet was too great to\r\npermit of the detection of both elsewhere than at Washington. But the\r\nLick equatoreal showed them, July 18, 1888, when their brightness was\r\nonly 0·12 its amount at the time of their discovery; so that they can\r\nnow be followed for a considerable time before and after the least\r\nfavourable oppositions.\r\n\r\nThe names chosen for them were taken from the Iliad, where \"Deimos\" and\r\n\"Phobos\" (Fear and Panic) are represented as the companions in battle of\r\nAres. In several respects, they are interesting and remarkable bodies.\r\nAs to size, they may be said to stand midway between meteorites and\r\nsatellites. From careful photometric measures executed at Harvard in\r\n1877 and 1879, Professor Pickering concluded their diameters to be\r\nrespectively six and seven miles.[1011] This is on the assumption that\r\nthey reflect the same proportion of the light incident upon them that\r\ntheir primary does. But it may very well be that they are less\r\nreflective, in which case they would be more extensive. The albedo of\r\nMars is put by Müller at 0·27; his surface, in other words, returns 27\r\nper cent. of the rays striking it. If we put the albedo of his\r\nsatellites equal to that of our moon, 0·17, their diameters will be\r\nincreased from 6 and 7 to 7-1/2 and 9 miles, Phobos, the inner one,\r\nbeing the larger. Mr. Lowell, however, formed a considerably larger\r\nestimate of their dimensions.[1012] It is interesting to note that\r\nDeimos, according to Professor Pickering's very distinct perception,\r\ndoes not share the reddish tint of Mars.\r\n\r\nDeimos completes its nearly circular revolutions in thirty hours\r\neighteen minutes, at a distance from the surface of its ruling body of\r\n12,500 miles; Phobos traverses an elliptical orbit[1013] in seven hours\r\nthirty-nine minutes twenty-two seconds, at a distance of only 3,760\r\nmiles. This is the only known instance of a satellite circulating faster\r\nthan its primary rotates, and is a circumstance of some importance as\r\nregards theories of planetary development. To a Martian spectator the\r\ncurious effect would ensue of a celestial object, seemingly exempt from\r\nthe general motion of the sphere, rising in the west, setting in the\r\neast, and culminating twice, or even thrice a day; which, moreover, in\r\nlatitudes above 69° north or south, would be permanently and altogether\r\nhidden by the intervening curvature of the globe.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe detection of new members of the solar system has come to be one of\r\nthe most ordinary of astronomical events. Since 1846 no single year has\r\npassed without bringing its tribute of asteroidal discovery. In the last\r\nof the seventies alone, a full score of miniature planets were\r\ndistinguished from the thronging stars amid which they seem to move;\r\n1875 brought seventeen such recognitions; their number touched a minimum\r\nof one in 1881; it rose in 1882, and again in 1886, to eleven; dropped\r\nto six in 1889, and sprang up with the aid of photography to\r\ntwenty-seven in 1892. That high level has since, on an average, been\r\nmaintained; and on January 1, 1902, nearly 500 asteroids were recognised\r\nas revolving between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Of these,\r\nconsiderably more than one hundred are claimed by one investigator\r\nalone--Dr. Max Wolf of Heidelburg; M. Charlois of Nice comes second with\r\n102; while among the earlier observers Palisa of Vienna contributed 86,\r\nand C. H. F. Peters of Clinton (N. Y.), whose varied and useful career\r\nterminated July 19, 1890, 52 to the grand total. The construction by\r\nChacornac and his successors at Paris, and more recently by Peters at\r\nClinton, of ecliptical charts showing all stars down to the thirteenth\r\nand fourteenth magnitudes respectively, rendered the picking out of moving\r\nobjects above that brightness a mere question of time and diligence. Both,\r\nhowever, are vastly economised by the photographic method. Tedious\r\ncomparisons of the sky with charts are no longer needed for the\r\nidentification of unrecorded, because simulated stars. Planetary bodies\r\ndeclare themselves by appearing upon the plate, not in circular, but in\r\nlinear form. Their motion converts their images into trails, long or short\r\naccording to the time of exposure. The first asteroid (No. 323) thus\r\ndetected was by Max Wolf, December 22, 1891.[1014] Eighteen others were\r\nsimilarly discovered in 1892, by the same skilful operator; and ten more\r\nthrough Charlois's adoption at Nice of the novel plan now in exclusive use\r\nfor picking up errant light-specks. Far more onerous than the task of their\r\ndiscovery is that of keeping them in view once discovered--of tracking out\r\ntheir paths, ixing their places, and calculating the disturbing effects\r\nupon them of the mighty Jovian mass. These complex operations have come to\r\nbe centralised at Berlin under the superintendence of Professor Tietjen,\r\nand their results are given to the public through the medium of the\r\n_Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch_.\r\n\r\nThe _cui bono?_ however, began to be agitated. Was it worth while to\r\nmaintain a staff of astronomers for the sole purpose of keeping hold\r\nover the identity of the innumerable component particles of a cosmical\r\nring? The prospect, indeed, of all but a select few of the asteroids\r\nbeing thrown back by their contemptuous captors into the sea of space\r\nseemed so imminent that Professor Watson provided by will against the\r\ndereliction of the twenty-two discovered by himself. But the fortunes of\r\nthe whole family improved through the distinction obtained by one of\r\nthem. On August 14, 1898, the trail of a rapidly-moving, star-like\r\nobject of the eleventh magnitude imprinted itself on a plate exposed by\r\nHerr Witt at the Urania Observatory, Berlin. Its originator proved to be\r\nunique among asteroids. \"Eros\" is, in sober fact,\r\n\r\n                 'one of those mysterious stars\r\n    Which hide themselves between the Earth and Mars,'\r\n\r\ndivined or imagined by Shelley.[1015] True, several of its congeners\r\ninvade the Martian sphere at intervals; but the proper habitat of Eros\r\nis within that limit, although its excursions transcend it. In other\r\nwords, its mean distance from the sun is about 135, as compared with the\r\nMartian distance of 141 million miles. Further, its orbit being so\r\nfortunately circumstanced as to bring it once in sixty-seven years\r\nwithin some 15 millions of miles of the earth, it is of extraordinary\r\nvalue to celestial surveyors. The calculation of its movements was much\r\nfacilitated by detections, through a retrospective search,[1016] of many\r\nof its linear images among the star-dots on the Harvard plates.[1017]\r\nThe little body--which can scarcely be more than twenty miles in\r\ndiameter--shows peculiarities of behaviour as well as of position. Dr.\r\nvon Oppolzer, in February, 1901,[1018] announced it to be extensively\r\nand rapidly variable. Once in 2 hours 38 minutes it lost about\r\nthree-fourths of its light,[1019] but these fluctuations quickly\r\ndiminished in range, and in the beginning of May ceased\r\naltogether.[1020] Evidently, then, they depend upon the situation of the\r\nasteroid relatively to ourselves; and, so far, events lent countenance\r\nto M. André's eclipse hypothesis, since mutual occultations of the\r\nsupposed planetary twins could only take place when the plane of their\r\nrevolutions passed through the earth, and this condition would be\r\ntransitory. Yet the recognition in Eros of an \"Algol asteroid\" seems on\r\nother grounds inadmissible;[1021] nor until the phenomenon is\r\nconspicuously renewed--as it probably will be at the opposition of\r\n1903--can there be much hope of finding its appropriate rationale.\r\n\r\nThe crowd of orbits disclosed by asteroidal detections invites attentive\r\nstudy. D'Arrest remarked in 1851,[1022] when only thirteen minor planets\r\nwere known, that supposing their paths to be represented by solid hoops,\r\nnot one of the thirteen could be lifted from its place without bringing\r\nthe others with it. The complexity of interwoven tracks thus illustrated\r\nhas grown almost in the numerical proportion of discovery. Yet no two\r\nactually intersect, because no two lie exactly in the same plane, so\r\nthat the chances of collision are at present _nil_. There is only one\r\ncase, indeed, in which it seems to be eventually possible. M. Lespiault\r\nhas pointed out that the curves traversed by \"Fidés\" and \"Maïa\" approach\r\nso closely that a time may arrive when the bodies in question will\r\neither coalesce or unite to form a binary system.[1023]\r\n\r\nThe maze threaded by the 500 asteroids contrasts singularly with the\r\nharmoniously ordered and rhythmically separated orbits of the larger\r\nplanets. Yet the seeming confusion is not without a plan.\r\nThe established rules of our system are far from being totally\r\ndisregarded by its minor members. The orbit of Pallas, with its\r\ninclination of 34° 42', touches the limit of departure from the ecliptic\r\nlevel; the average obliquity of the asteroidal paths is somewhat less\r\nthan that of the sun's equator;[1024] their mean eccentricity is below\r\nthat of the curve traced out by Mercury, and all without exception are\r\npursued in the planetary direction--from west to east.\r\n\r\nThe zone in which these small bodies travel is about three times as wide\r\nas the interval separating the earth from the sun. It extends perilously\r\nnear to Jupiter, and dovetails into the sphere of Mars.\r\n\r\nTheir distribution is very unequal. They are most densely congregated\r\nabout the place where a single planet ought, by Bode's Law, to revolve;\r\nit may indeed be said that only stragglers from the main body are found\r\nmore than fifty million miles within or without a mean distance from the\r\nsun 2·8 times that of the earth. Significant gaps, too, occur where some\r\nforce prohibitive of their presence would seem to be at work. The\r\nprobable nature of that force was suggested by the late Professor\r\nKirkwood, first in 1866, when the number of known asteroids was only\r\neighty-eight, and again with more confidence in 1876, from the study of\r\na list then run up to 172.[1025] It appears that these bare spaces are\r\nfound just where a revolving body would have a period connected by a\r\nsimple relation with that of Jupiter. It would perform two or three\r\ncircuits to his one, five to his two, nine to his five, and so on.\r\nKirkwood's inference was that the gaps in question were cleared of\r\nasteroids by the attractive influence of Jupiter. For disturbances\r\nrecurring time after time--owing to commensurability of periods--nearly\r\nat the same part of the orbit, would have accumulated until the shape of\r\nthat orbit was notably changed. The body thus displaced would have come\r\nin contact with other cosmical particles of the same family with\r\nitself--then, it may be assumed, more evenly scattered than now--would\r\nhave coalesced with them, and permanently left its original track. In\r\nthis way the regions of maximum perturbation would gradually have become\r\ndenuded of their occupants.\r\n\r\nWe can scarcely doubt that this law of commensurability has largely\r\ninfluenced the present distribution of the asteroids. But its effects\r\nmust have been produced while they were still in an unformed, perhaps a\r\nnebular condition. In a system giving room for considerable modification\r\nthrough disturbance, the recurrence of conjunctions with a dominating\r\nmass at the same orbital point need not involve instability.[1026] On\r\nthe whole, the correspondence of facts with Kirkwood's hypothesis has\r\nnot been impaired by their more copious collection.[1027] Some chasms of\r\nsecondary importance have indeed been bridged; but the principal stand\r\nout more conspicuously through the denser scattering of orbits near\r\ntheir margins. Nor is it doubtful that the influence of Jupiter in some\r\nway produced them. M. de Freycinet's study of the problem they\r\npresent[1028] has, however, led him to the conclusion that they existed\r\n_ab origine_, thus testifying rather to the preventive than to the\r\nperturbing power of the giant planet.\r\n\r\nThe existence, too, of numerous asteroidal pairs travelling in\r\napproximately coincident tracks, must date from a remote antiquity. They\r\nresult, Professor Kirkwood[1029] believed, from the divellent action of\r\nJupiter upon embryo pigmy planets, just as comets moving in pursuit of\r\none another are a consequence of the sundering influence of the sun.\r\n\r\nLeverrier fixed, in 1853,[1030] one-fourth of the earth's mass as the\r\noutside limit for the combined masses of all the bodies circulating\r\nbetween Mars and Jupiter; but it is far from probable that this maximum\r\nis at all nearly approached. M. Berberich[1031] held that the moon would\r\nmore than outweigh the whole of them, a million of the lesser bodies\r\nshining like stars of the twelfth magnitude being needed, according to\r\nhis judgment, to constitute her mass. And M. Niesten estimated that the\r\nwhole of the 216 asteroids discovered up to August, 1880, amounted in\r\n_volume_ to only 1/4000th of our globe,[1032] and we may safely\r\nadd--since they are tolerably certain to be lighter, bulk for bulk, than\r\nthe earth--that their proportionate _mass_ is smaller still. A fairly\r\nconcordant result was published in 1895 by Mr. B. M. Roszel.[1033] He\r\nfound that the lunar globe probably contains forty times, the\r\nterrestrial globe 3,240 times the quantity of matter parcelled out among\r\nthe first 311 minor planets. The actual size of a few of them may now be\r\nsaid to be known. Professor Pickering, from determinations of\r\nlight-intensity, assigned to Vesta a diameter of 319 miles, to Pallas\r\n167, to Juno 94, down to twelve and fourteen for the smaller members of\r\nthe group.[1034] An albedo equal to that of Mars was assumed as the\r\nbasis of the calculation. Moreover, Professor G. Müller[1035] of Potsdam\r\nexamined photometrically the phases of seven among them, of which\r\nfour--namely, Vesta, Iris, Massalia, and Amphitrite--were found to\r\nconform precisely to the behaviour of Mars as regards light-change from\r\nposition, while Ceres, Pallas, and Irene varied after the manner of the\r\nmoon and Mercury. The first group were hence inferred to resemble Mars\r\nin physical constitution, nature of atmosphere, and reflective capacity;\r\nthe second to be moon-like bodies.\r\n\r\nFinally, Professor Barnard, directly measuring with the Yerkes refractor\r\nthe minute discs presented by the original quartette, obtained the\r\nfollowing authentic data concerning them:[1036] Diameter of Ceres, 477\r\nmiles, albedo = 0·18; diameter of Pallas, 304 miles, albedo = 0·23;\r\ndiameter of Vesta, 239 miles, albedo = 0·74; diameter of Juno, 120\r\nmiles, albedo = 0·45. Thus, the rank of premier asteroid proves to\r\nbelong to Ceres, and to have been erroneously assigned to Vesta in\r\nconsequence of its deceptive brilliancy. What kind of surface this\r\nindicates, it is hard to say. The dazzling whiteness of snow can hardly\r\nbe attributed to bare rock; yet the dynamical theory of gases--as Dr.\r\nJohnstone Stoney pointed out in 1867[1037]--prohibits the supposition\r\nthat bodies of insignificant gravitative power can possess aerial\r\nenvelopes. Even our moon, it is calculated, could not permanently hold\r\nback the particles of oxygen, nitrogen, or water-gas from escaping into\r\ninfinite space; still less, a globe one thousand times smaller. Vogel's\r\nsuspicion of an air-line in the spectrum of Vesta[1038] has,\r\naccordingly, not been confirmed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCrossing the zone of asteroids on our journey outward from the sun, we\r\nmeet with a group of bodies widely different from the \"inferior\" or\r\nterrestrial planets. Their gigantic size, low specific gravity, and\r\nrapid rotation, obviously from the first threw the \"superior\" planets\r\ninto a class apart; and modern research has added qualities still more\r\nsignificant of a dissimilar physical constitution. Jupiter, a huge globe\r\n86,000 miles in diameter, stands pre-eminent among them. He is, however,\r\nonly _primus inter pares_; all the wider inferences regarding his\r\ncondition may be extended, with little risk of error, to his fellows;\r\nand inferences in his case rest on surer grounds than in the case of the\r\nothers, from the advantages offered for telescopic scrutiny by his\r\ncomparative nearness.\r\n\r\nNow the characteristic modern discovery concerning Jupiter is that he is\r\na body midway between the solar and terrestrial stages of cosmical\r\nexistence--a decaying sun or a developing earth, as we choose to put\r\nit--whose vast unexpended stores of internal heat are mainly, if not\r\nsolely, efficient in producing the interior agitations betrayed by the\r\nchanging features of his visible disc. This view, impressed upon modern\r\nreaders by Mr. Proctor's popular works, was anticipated in the last\r\ncentury. Buffon wrote in his _Époques de la Nature_ (1778):[1039]--\"La\r\nsurface de Jupiter est, comme l'on sait, sujette à des changemens\r\nsensibles, qui semblent indiquer que cette grosse planète est encore\r\ndans un état d'inconstance et de bouillonnement.\"\r\n\r\nPrimitive incandescence, attendant, in his fantastic view, on planetary\r\norigin by cometary impacts with the sun, combined, he concluded, with\r\nvast bulk to bring about this result. Jupiter has not yet had time to\r\ncool. Kant thought similarly in 1785;[1040] but the idea did not commend\r\nitself to the astronomers of the time, and dropped out of sight until\r\nMr. Nasmyth arrived at it afresh in 1853.[1041] Even still, however,\r\nterrestrial analogies held their ground. The dark belts running parallel\r\nto the equator, first seen at Naples in 1630, continued to be\r\nassociated--as Herschel had associated them in 1781--with Jovian\r\ntrade-winds, in raising which the deficient power of the sun was\r\nsupposed to be compensated by added swiftness of rotation. But opinion\r\nwas not permitted to halt here.\r\n\r\nIn 1860 G. P. Bond of Cambridge (U.S.) derived some remarkable\r\nindications from experiments on the light of Jupiter.[1042] They showed\r\nthat fourteen times more of the photographic rays striking it are\r\nreflected by the planet than by our moon, and that, unlike the moon,\r\nwhich sends its densest rays from the margin, Jupiter is brightest near\r\nthe centre. But the most perplexing part of his results was that Jupiter\r\nactually seemed to give out more light than he received. Bond, however,\r\nrightly considered his data too uncertain for the support of so bold an\r\nassumption as that of original luminosity, and, even if the presence of\r\nnative light were proved, thought that it might emanate from auroral\r\nclouds of the terrestrial kind. The conception of a sun-like planet was\r\nstill a remote, and seemed an extravagant one.\r\n\r\nOnly since it was adopted and enforced by Zöllner in 1865,[1043] can it\r\nbe regarded as permanently acquired to science. The rapid changes in the\r\ncloud-belts both of Jupiter and Saturn, he remarked, attest a high\r\ninternal temperature. For we know that all atmospheric movements on the\r\nearth are sun-heat transformed into motion. But sun-heat at the distance\r\nof Jupiter possesses but 1/27, at that of Saturn 1/100 of its force\r\nhere. The large amount of energy, then, obviously exerted in those\r\nremote firmaments must have some other source, to be found nowhere else\r\nthan in their own active and all-pervading fires, not yet banked in with\r\na thick solid crust.\r\n\r\nThe same acute investigator dwelt, in 1871,[1044] on the similarity\r\nbetween the modes of rotation of the great planets and of the sun,\r\napplying the same principles of explanation to each case. The fact of\r\nthis similarity is undoubted. Cassini[1045] and Schröter both noticed\r\nthat markings on Jupiter travelled quicker the nearer they were to his\r\nequator; and Cassini even hinted at their possible assimilation to\r\nsun-spots.[1046] It is now well ascertained that, as a rule (not without\r\nexceptions), equatorial spots give a period some 5-1/2 minutes shorter\r\nthan those in latitudes of about 30°. But, as Mr. Denning has pointed\r\nout,[1047] no single period will satisfy the observations either of\r\ndifferent markings at the same epoch, or of the same markings at\r\ndifferent epochs. Accelerations and retardations, depending upon\r\nprocesses of growth or change, take place in very much the same kind of\r\nway as in solar maculæ, inevitably suggesting similarity of origin.\r\n\r\nThe interesting query as to Jupiter's surface incandescence has been\r\nstudied since Bond's time with the aid of all the appliances furnished\r\nto physical inquirers by modern inventiveness, yet without bringing to\r\nit a categorical reply. Zöllner in 1865, Müller in 1893, estimated his\r\nalbedo at 0·62 and 0·75 respectively, that of fresh-fallen snow being\r\n0·78, and of white paper 0·70.[1048] But the disc of Jupiter is by no\r\nmeans purely white. The general ground is tinged with ochre; the polar\r\nzones are leaden or fawn coloured; large spaces are at times stained or\r\nsuffused with chocolate-browns and rosy hues. It is occasionally seen\r\nruled from pole to pole with dusky bars, and is never wholly free from\r\nobscure markings. The reflection, then, by it, as a whole, of about 70\r\nper cent. of the rays impinging upon it, might well suggest some\r\noriginal reinforcement.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the spectroscope gives little countenance to the\r\nsupposition of any considerable permanent light-emission. The spectrum\r\nof Jupiter, as examined by Huggins, 1862-64, and by Vogel, 1871-73,\r\nshows the familiar Fraunhofer rays belonging to reflected sunlight. But\r\nit also shows lines of native absorption. Some of these are identical\r\nwith those produced by the action of our own atmosphere, especially one\r\nor more groups due to aqueous vapours; others are of unknown origin;\r\nand it is remarkable that one among the latter--a strong band in the\r\nred--agrees in position with a dark line in the spectra of some ruddy\r\nstars.[1049] There is, besides, a general absorption of blue rays,\r\nintensified--as Le Sueur observed at Melbourne in 1869[1050]--in the\r\ndusky markings, evidently through an increase of depth in the atmospheric\r\nstrata traversed by the light proceeding from them.\r\n\r\nAll these observations, however (setting aside the stellar line as of\r\ndoubtful significance), point to a cool planetary atmosphere. One\r\nspectrograph, it is true, taken by Dr. Henry Draper, September 27,\r\n1879,[1051] seemed to attest the action of intrinsic light; but the\r\npeculiarity was referred by Dr. Vogel, with convincing clearness, to a\r\nflaw in the film.[1052] So far, then, native emissions from any part of\r\nJupiter's diversified surface have not been detected; and, indeed, the\r\nblackness of the shadows cast by his satellites on his disc sufficiently\r\nproves that he sends out virtually none but reflected light.[1053] This\r\nconclusion, however, by no means invalidates that of his high internal\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nThe curious phenomena attending Jovian satellite-transits may be\r\nexplained, partly as effects of contrast, partly as due to temporary\r\nobscurations of the small discs projected on the large disc of Jupiter.\r\nAt their first entry upon its marginal parts, which are several times\r\nless luminous than those near the centre, they invariably show as bright\r\nspots, then usually vanish as the background gains lustre, to reappear,\r\nafter crossing the disc, thrown into relief, as before, against the\r\ndusky limb. But instances are not rare, more especially of the third and\r\nfourth satellites standing out, during the entire middle part of their\r\ncourse, in such inky darkness as to be mistaken for their own shadows.\r\nThe earliest witness of a \"black transit\" was Cassini, September 2,\r\n1665; Römer in 1677, and Maraldi in 1707 and 1713, made similar\r\nobservations, which have been multiplied in recent years. In some cases\r\nthe process of darkening has been visibly attended by the formation, or\r\nemergence into view, of spots on the transiting body, as noted by the\r\ntwo Bonds at Harvard, March 18, 1848.[1054] The third satellite was seen\r\nby Dawes, half dark, half bright, when crossing Jupiter's disc, August\r\n21, 1867;[1055] one-third dark by Davidson of California, January 15,\r\n1884, under the same circumstances;[1056] and unmistakably spotted, both\r\non and off the planet, by Schröter, Secchi, Dawes, and Lassell.\r\n\r\nThe first satellite sometimes looks dusky, but never absolutely black,\r\nin travelling over the disc of Jupiter. The second appears uniformly\r\nwhite--a circumstance attributed by Dr. Spitta[1057] to its high albedo.\r\nThe singularly different aspects, even during successive transits, of\r\nthe third and fourth satellites, are connected by Professor Holden[1058]\r\nwith the varied luminosity of the segments of the planetary surface they\r\nare projected upon, and W. H. Pickering inclines to the same opinion;\r\nbut fluctuations in their own brightness[1059] may be a concurrent\r\ncause. Herschel concluded in 1797 that, like our moon, they always turn\r\nthe same face towards their primary, and as regards the outer satellite,\r\nEngelmann's researches in 1871, and C. E. Burton's in 1873, made this\r\nalmost certain; while both for the third and fourth Jovian moons it was\r\ncompletely assured by W. H. Pickering's and A. E. Douglass's\r\nobservations at Arequipa in 1892,[1060] and at Flagstaff in\r\n1894-95.[1061] Strangely enough, however, the interior members of the\r\nsystem have preserved a relatively swift rotation, notwithstanding the\r\nenormous checking influence upon it of Jove-raised tides.\r\n\r\nAll the satellites are stated, on good authority, to be more or less\r\negg-shaped. On September 8, 1890, Barnard saw the first elongated and\r\nbisected by a bright equatorial belt, during one of its dark\r\ntransits;[1062] and his observation, repeated August 3, 1891, was\r\ncompletely verified by Schaeberle and Campbell, who ascertained,\r\nmoreover, that the longer axis of the prolate body was directed towards\r\nJupiter's centre.[1063] The ellipticity of its companions was determined\r\nby Pickering and Douglass; indeed, that of No. 3 had long previously\r\nbeen noticed by Secchi.[1064] No. 3 also shows equatorial stripes,\r\nperceived in 1891 by Schaeberle and Campbell,[1065] and evident later to\r\nPickering and Douglass;[1066] nor need we hesitate to admit as authentic\r\ntheir records of similar, though less conspicuous markings on the other\r\nsatellites. A constitution analogous to that of Jupiter himself was thus\r\nunexpectedly suggested; and Vogel's detection of lines--or traces of\r\nlines--in their spectra, agreeing with absorption-rays derived from\r\ntheir primary, lends support to the conjecture that they possess gaseous\r\nenvelopes similar to his.\r\n\r\nThe system of Jupiter, as it was discovered by Galileo, and investigated\r\nby Laplace, appeared in its outward aspect so symmetrical, and displayed\r\nin its inner mechanism such harmonious dynamical relations, that it\r\nmight well have been deemed complete. Nevertheless, a new member has\r\nbeen added to it. Near midnight on September 9, 1892, Professor Barnard\r\ndiscerned with the Lick 36-inch \"a tiny speck of light,\" closely\r\nfollowing the planet.[1067] He instantly divined its nature, watched its\r\nhurried disappearance in the adjacent glare, and made sure of the\r\nreality of his discovery on the ensuing night. It was a delicate\r\nbusiness throughout, the Liliputian luminary subsiding into invisibility\r\nbefore the slightest glint of Jovian light, and tarrying, only for brief\r\nintervals, far enough from the disc to admit of its exclusion by means\r\nof an occulting plate. The new satellite is estimated to be of the\r\nthirteenth stellar magnitude, and, if equally reflective of light with\r\nits next neighbour, Io (satellite No. 1), its diameter must be about one\r\nhundred miles. It revolves at a distance of 112,500 miles from Jupiter's\r\ncentre, and of 68,000 from his bulging equatorial surface. Its period of\r\n11h. 57m. 23s. is just two hours longer than Jupiter's period of\r\nrotation, so that Phobos still remains a unique example of a secondary\r\nbody revolving faster than its primary rotates. Jupiter's innermost moon\r\nconforms in its motions strictly, indeed inevitably, to the plane of his\r\nequatorial protuberance, following, however, a sensibly elliptical path\r\nthe major axis of which is in rapid revolution.[1068] Its very\r\ninsignificance raises the suspicion that it may not prove solitary.\r\nPossibly it belongs to a zone peopled by asteroidal satellites. More\r\nthan fifteen thousand such small bodies could be furnished out of the\r\nmaterials of a single full-sized satellite spoiled in the making. But we\r\nmust be content for the present to register the fact without seeking to\r\npenetrate the meaning of its existence. Very high and very fine\r\ntelescopic power is needed for its perception. Outside the United\r\nStates, it has been very little observed. The only instruments in this\r\ncountry successfully employed for its detection are, we believe, Dr.\r\nCommon's 5-foot reflector and Mr. Newall's 25-inch refractor.\r\n\r\nIn the course of his observations on Jupiter at Brussels in 1878, M.\r\nNiesten was struck with a rosy cloud attached to a whitish zone beneath\r\nthe dark southern equatorial band.[1069] Its size was enormous. At the\r\ndistance of Jupiter, its measured dimensions of 13\" by 3\" implied a real\r\nextension in longitude of 30,000, in latitude of something short of\r\n7,000 miles. The earliest record of its appearance seems to be by\r\nProfessor Pritchett, director of the Morrison Observatory (U.S.), who\r\nfigured and described it July 9, 1878.[1070] It was again delineated\r\nAugust 9, by Tempel at Florence.[1071] In the following year it\r\nattracted the wonder and attention of almost every possessor of a\r\ntelescope. Its colour had by that time deepened into a full brick-red,\r\nand was set off by contrast with a white equatorial spot of unusual\r\nbrilliancy. During three ensuing years these remarkable objects\r\ncontinued to offer a visible and striking illustration of the compound\r\nnature of the planet's rotation. The red spot completed a circuit in\r\nnine hours fifty-five minutes thirty-six seconds; the white spot in\r\nabout five and a half minutes less. Their _relative_ motion was thus no\r\nless than 260 miles an hour, bringing them together in the same meridian\r\nat intervals of forty-four days ten hours forty-two minutes. Neither,\r\nhowever, preserved continuously the same uniform rate of travel. The\r\nperiod of each had lengthened by some seconds in 1883, while sudden\r\ndisplacements, associated with the recovery of lustre after recurrent\r\nfadings, were observed in the position of the white spot,[1072]\r\nrecalling the leap forward of a reviving sun-spot. Just the opposite\r\neffect attended the rekindling of the companion object. While\r\nsemi-extinct, in 1882-84, it lost little motion; but a fresh access of\r\nretardation was observed by Professor Young[1073] in connection with its\r\nbrightening in 1886. This suggests very strongly that the red spot is\r\n_fed from below_. A shining aureola of \"faculæ,\" described by Bredichin\r\nat Moscow, and by Lohse at Potsdam, as encircling it in September,\r\n1879,[1074] was held to strengthen the solar analogy.\r\n\r\nThe conspicuous visibility of this astonishing object lasted three\r\nyears. When the planet returned to opposition in 1882-83, it had faded\r\nso considerably that Riccò's uncertain glimpse of it at Palermo, May 31,\r\n1883, was expected to be the last. It had, nevertheless, begun to\r\nrecover in December, and presented to Mr. Denning in the beginning of\r\n1886 much the same aspect as in October, 1882.[1075] Observed by him in\r\nan intermediate stage, February 25, 1885, when \"a mere skeleton of its\r\nformer self,\" it bore a striking likeness to an \"elliptical ring\"\r\ndescried in the same latitude by Mr. Gledhill in 1869-70. This, indeed,\r\nmight be called the preliminary sketch for the famous object brought to\r\nperfection ten years later, but which Mr. H. C. Russell of Sydney saw\r\nand drew still unfinished in June, 1876,[1076] before it had separated\r\nfrom its matrix, the dusky south tropical belt. In earlier times, too, a\r\nmarking \"at once fixed and transient\" had been repeatedly perceived\r\nattached to the southernmost of the central belts. It gave Cassini in\r\n1665 a rotation-period of nine hours fifty-six minutes,[1077] reappeared\r\nand vanished eight times during the next forty-three years, and was last\r\nseen by Maraldi in 1713. It was, however, very much smaller than the\r\nrecent object, and showed no unusual colour.[1078]\r\n\r\nThe assiduous observations made on the \"Great Red Spot\" by Mr. Denning\r\nat Bristol and by Professor Hough at Chicago afforded grounds only for\r\nnegative conclusions as to its nature. It certainly did _not_ represent\r\nthe outpourings of a Jovian volcano; it was in no sense attached to the\r\nJovian soil--if the phrase have any application to that planet; it was\r\n_not_ a mere disclosure of a glowing mass elsewhere seethed over by\r\nrolling vapours. It was, indeed, certainly not self-luminous, a\r\nsatellite projected upon it in transit having been seen to show as\r\nbright as upon the dusky equatorial bands. A fundamental objection to\r\nall three hypotheses is that the rotation of the spot was variable. It\r\ndid not then ride at anchor, but floated free. Some held that its\r\nsurface was depressed below the average cloud-level, and that the cavity\r\nwas filled with vapours. Professor Wilson, on the other hand, observing\r\nwith the 16-inch equatorial of the Goodsell Observatory in Minnesota,\r\nreceived a persistent impression of the object \"being at a higher level\r\nthan the other markings.\"[1079] A crucial experiment on this point was\r\nproposed by Mr. Stanley Williams in 1890.[1080] A dark spot moving\r\nfaster along the same parallel was timed to overtake the red spot\r\ntowards the end of July. A unique opportunity hence appeared to be at\r\nhand of determining the relative vertical depths of the two formations,\r\none of which must inevitably, it was thought, pass above the other. No\r\nforecast included a third alternative, which was nevertheless adopted by\r\nthe dark spot. It evaded the obstacle in its path by skirting round its\r\nsouthern edge.[1081] Nothing, then, was gained by the conjunction,\r\nbeyond an additional proof of the singular repellent influence exerted\r\nby the red spot over the markings in its vicinity. It has, for example,\r\ngradually carved out a deep bay for its accommodation in the gray belt\r\njust north of it. The effect was not at first steadily present. A\r\npremonitory excavation was drawn by Schwabe at Dessau, September 5,\r\n1831, and again by Trouvelot, Barnard, and Elvins in 1879; yet there was\r\nno sign of it in the following year. Its development can be traced in\r\nDr. Boeddicker's beautiful delineations of Jupiter, made with the\r\nParsonstown 3-foot reflector, from 1881 to 1886.[1082] They record the\r\nbelt as straight in 1881, but as strongly indented from January, 1883;\r\nand the cavity now promises to outlast the spot. So long as it survives,\r\nhowever, the forces at work in the spot can have lost little of their\r\nactivity. For it must be remembered that the belt has a shorter\r\nrotation-period than the red spot, which, accordingly (as Mr. Elvins of\r\nToronto has pointed out), breasts and diverts, by its interior energy, a\r\ncurrent of flowing matter, ever ready to fill up its natural bed, and\r\noverride the barrier of obstruction.\r\n\r\nThe famous spot was described by Keeler in 1889, as \"of a pale pink\r\ncolour, slightly lighter in the middle. Its outline was a fairly true\r\nellipse, framed in by bright white clouds.\"[1083] The fading\r\ncontinuously in progress from 1887 was temporarily interrupted in 1891.\r\nThe revival, indeed, was brief. Professor Barnard wrote in August, 1892:\r\n\"The great red spot is still visible, but it has just passed through a\r\ncrisis that seemingly threatened its very existence. For the past month\r\nit has been all but impossible to catch the feeblest trace of the spot,\r\nthough the ever-persistent bay in the equatorial belt close north of it,\r\nand which has been so intimately connected with the history of the red\r\nspot, has been as conspicuous as ever. It is now, however, possible to\r\ndetect traces of the entire spot. An obscuring medium seems to have been\r\npassing over it, and has now drifted somewhat preceding the spot.\"[1084]\r\n\r\nThe object is now always inconspicuous, and often practically invisible,\r\nand may be said to float passively in the environing medium.[1085] Yet\r\nthere are sparks beneath the ashes. A rosy tinge faintly suffused it in\r\nApril, 1900,[1086] and its absolute end may still be remote.\r\n\r\nThe extreme complexity of the planet's surface-movements has been\r\nstrikingly evinced by Mr. Stanley Williams's detailed investigations. He\r\nenumerated in 1896[1087] nine principal currents, all flowing parallel\r\nto the equator, but unsymmetrically placed north and south of it, and\r\nshowing scant signs of conformity to the solar rule of retardation with\r\nincrease of latitude. The linear rate of the planet's equatorial\r\nrotation was spectroscopically determined by Bélopolsky and Deslandres\r\nin 1895. Both found it to fall short of the calculated speed, whence an\r\nenlargement, by self-refraction, of the apparent disc was\r\ninferred.[1088]\r\n\r\nJupiter was systematically photographed with the Lick 36-inch telescope\r\nduring the oppositions of 1890, 1891, and 1892, the image thrown on the\r\nplates (after eightfold direct enlargement) being one inch in diameter.\r\nMr. Stanley Williams's measurements and discussion of the set for 1891\r\nshowed the high value of the materials thus collected, although much\r\nmore minute details can be seen than can at present be photographed. The\r\nred spot shows as \"very distinctly annular\" in several of these\r\npictures.[1089] Recently, the planet has been portrayed by Deslandres\r\nwith the 62-foot Meudon refractor.[1090] The extreme actinic feebleness\r\nof the equatorial bands was strikingly apparent on his plates.\r\n\r\nIn 1870, Mr. Ranyard[1091]--whose death, December 14, 1894, was a\r\nserious loss to astronomy--acting upon an earlier suggestion of Sir\r\nWilliam Huggins, collected records of unusual appearances on the disc of\r\nJupiter, with a view to investigate the question of their recurrence at\r\nregular intervals. He concluded that the development of the deeper\r\ntinges of colour, and of the equatorial \"port-hole\" markings girdling\r\nthe globe in regular alternations of bright and dusky, agreed, so far as\r\ncould be ascertained, with epochs of sun-spot maximum. The further\r\ninquiries of Dr. Lohse at Bothkamp in 1873[1092] went to strengthen the\r\ncoincidence, which had been anticipated _à priori_ by Zöllner in\r\n1871.[1093] Moreover, separate and distinct evidence was alleged by Mr.\r\nDenning in 1899 of decennial outbreaks of disturbance in north temperate\r\nregions.[1094] It may, indeed, be taken for granted that what Hahn terms\r\nthe universal pulse of the solar system[1095] affects the vicissitudes\r\nof Jupiter; but the law of those vicissitudes is far from being so\r\nobviously subordinate to the rhythmical flow of central disturbance as\r\nare certain terrestrial phenomena. The great planet, being in fact\r\nhimself a \"semi-sun,\" may be regarded as an originator, no less than a\r\nrecipient, of agitating influences, the combined effects of which may\r\nwell appear insubordinate to any obvious law.\r\n\r\nIt is likely that Saturn is in a still earlier stage of planetary\r\ndevelopment than Jupiter. He is the lightest for his size of all the\r\nplanets. In fact, he would float in water. And since his density is\r\nshown, by the amount of his equatorial bulging, to increase\r\ncentrally,[1096] it follows that his superficial materials must be of a\r\nspecific gravity so low as to be inconsistent, on any probable\r\nsupposition, with the solid or liquid states. Moreover, the chief\r\narguments in favour of the high temperature of Jupiter, apply, with\r\nincreased force, to Saturn; so that it may be concluded, without much\r\nrisk of error, that a large proportion of his bulky globe, 73,000 miles\r\nin diameter, is composed of heated vapours, kept in active and agitated\r\ncirculation by the process of cooling.\r\n\r\nHis unique set of appendages has, since the middle of the last century,\r\nformed the subject of searching and fruitful inquiries, both theoretical\r\nand telescopic. The mechanical problem of the stability of Saturn's\r\nrings was left by Laplace in a very unsatisfactory condition.\r\nConsidering them as rotating solid bodies, he pointed out that they\r\ncould not maintain their position unless their weight were in some way\r\nunsymmetrically distributed; but made no attempt to determine the kind\r\nor amount of irregularity needed to secure this end. Some observations\r\nby Herschel gave astronomers an excuse for taking for granted the\r\nfulfilment of the condition thus vaguely postulated; and the question\r\nremained in abeyance until once more brought prominently forward by the\r\ndiscovery of the dusky ring in 1850.\r\n\r\nThe younger Bond led the way, among modern observers, in denying the\r\nsolidity of the structure. The fluctuations in its aspect were, he\r\nasserted in 1851,[1097] inconsistent with such a hypothesis. The fine\r\ndark lines of division, frequently detected in both bright rings, and as\r\nfrequently relapsing into imperceptibility, were due, in his opinion, to\r\nthe real nobility of their particles, and indicated a fluid formation.\r\nProfessor Benjamin Peirce of Harvard University immediately followed\r\nwith a demonstration, on abstract grounds, of their non-solidity.[1098]\r\nStreams of some fluid denser than water were, he maintained, the\r\nphysical reality giving rise to the anomalous appearance first disclosed\r\nby Galileo's telescope.\r\n\r\nThe mechanism of Saturn's rings, proposed as the subject of the Adams\r\nPrize, was dealt with by James Clerk Maxwell in 1857. His investigation\r\nforms the groundwork of all that is at present known in the matter. Its\r\nupshot was to show that neither solid nor fluid rings could continue to\r\nexist, and that the only possible composition of the system was by an\r\naggregated multitude of unconnected particles, each revolving\r\nindependently in a period corresponding to its distance from the\r\nplanet.[1099] This idea of a satellite-formation had been, remarkably\r\nenough, several times entertained and lost sight of. It was first put\r\nforward by Roberval in the seventeenth century, again by Jacques Cassini\r\nin 1715, and with perfect definiteness by Wright of Durham in\r\n1750.[1100] Little heed, however, was taken of these casual\r\nanticipations of a truth which reappeared, a virtual novelty, as the\r\nlegitimate outcome of the most refined modern methods.\r\n\r\nThe details of telescopic observation accord, on the whole, admirably\r\nwith this hypothesis. The displacements or disappearance of secondary\r\ndividing-lines--the singular striated appearance, first remarked by\r\nShort in the eighteenth century, last by Perrotin and Lockyer at Nice,\r\nMarch 18, 1884[1101]--show the effects of waves of disturbance\r\ntraversing a moving mass of gravitating particles;[1102] the broken and\r\nchanging line of the planet's shadow on the ring gives evidence of\r\nvariety in the planes of the orbits described by those particles. The\r\nwhole ring-system, too, appears to be somewhat elliptical.[1103]\r\n\r\nThe satellite-theory has derived unlooked-for support from photometric\r\ninquiries. Professor Seeliger pointed out in 1888[1104] that the\r\nunvarying brilliancy of the outer rings under all angles of\r\nillumination, from 0° to 30°, can be explained from no other point of\r\nview. Nor does the constitution of the obscure inner ring offer any\r\ndifficulty. For it is doubtless formed of similar small bodies to those\r\naggregated in the lucid members of the system, only much more thinly\r\nstrewn, and reflecting, consequently, much less light. It is not,\r\nindeed, at first easy to see why these sparser flights should show as a\r\ndense dark shading on the body of Saturn. Yet this is invariably the\r\ncase. The objection has been urged by Professor Hastings of Baltimore.\r\nThe brightest parts of these appendages, he remarked,[1105] are more\r\nlustrous than the globe they encircle; but if the inner ring consists of\r\nidentical materials, possessing presumably an equal reflective capacity,\r\nthe mere fact of their scanty distribution would not cause them to show\r\nas dark against the same globe. Professor Seeliger, however,\r\nreplied[1106] that the darkening is due to the never-ending swarms of\r\ntheir separate shadows transiting the planet's disc. Sunlight is not,\r\nindeed, wholly excluded. Many rays come and go between the open ranks of\r\nthe meteorites. For the dusky ring is transparent. The planet it\r\nencloses shows through it, as if veiled with a strip of crape. A\r\nbeautiful illustration of its quality in this respect was derived by\r\nProfessor Barnard from an eclipse of Japetus, November 1, 1889.[1107]\r\nThe eighth moon remained steadily visible during its passage through the\r\nshadow of the inner ring, but with a progressive loss of lustre in\r\napproaching its bright neighbour. There was no breach of continuity. The\r\nsatellite met no gap, corresponding to that between the dusky ring and\r\nthe body of Saturn, through which it could shine with undiminished\r\nlight, but was slowly lost sight of as it plunged into deeper and deeper\r\ngloom. The important facts were thus established, that the brilliant and\r\nobscure rings merge into each other, and that the latter thins out\r\ntowards the Saturnian globe.\r\n\r\nThe meteoric constitution of these appendages was beautifully\r\ndemonstrated in 1895 by Professor Keeler,[1108] then director of the\r\nAlleghany Observatory, Pittsburgh. From spectrographs taken with the\r\nslit adjusted to coincidence with the equatorial plane of the system, he\r\ndetermined the comparative radial velocities of its different parts. And\r\nthese supply a crucial test of Clerk Maxwell's theory. For if the rings\r\nwere solid, the swiftest rates of rotation should be at their outer\r\nedges, corresponding to wider circles described in the same period;\r\nwhile, if they are pulverulent, the inverse relation must hold good.\r\nThis proved to be actually the case. The motion slowed off outward, in\r\nagreement with the diminishing speed of particles travelling freely,\r\neach in its own orbit. Keeler's result was promptly confirmed by\r\nCampbell,[1109] as well as by Deslandres and Bélopolsky.\r\n\r\nA question of singular interest, and one which we cannot refrain from\r\nputting to ourselves, is--whether we see in the rings of Saturn a\r\nfinished structure, destined to play a permanent part in the economy of\r\nthe system; or whether they represent merely a stage in the process of\r\ndevelopment out of the chaotic state in which it is impossible to doubt\r\nthat the materials of all planets were originally merged. M. Otto Struve\r\nattempted to give a definite answer to this important query.\r\n\r\nA study of early and later records of observations disclosed to him, in\r\n1851, an apparent progressive approach of the inner edge of the bright\r\nring to the planet. The rate of approach he estimated at about\r\nfifty-seven English miles a year, or 11,000 miles during the 194 years\r\nelapsed since the time of Huygens.[1110] Were it to continue, a collapse\r\nof the system must be far advanced within three centuries. But was the\r\nchange real or illusory--a plausible, but deceptive inference from\r\ninsecure data? M. Struve resolved to put it to the test. A set of\r\nelaborately careful micrometrical measures of the dimensions of Saturn's\r\nrings, executed by himself at Pulkowa in the autumn of 1851, was\r\nprovided as a standard of future comparison; and he was enabled to renew\r\nthem, under closely similar circumstances, in 1882.[1111] But the\r\nexpected diminution of the space between Saturn's globe and his rings\r\nhad not taken place. A slight extension in the width of the system, both\r\noutward and inward, was indeed, hinted at; and it is worth notice that\r\njust such a separation of the rings was indicated by Clerk Maxwell's\r\ntheory, so that there is an _à priori_ likelihood of its being in\r\nprogress. Yet Hall's measures in 1884-87[1112] failed to supply evidence\r\nof alteration with time; and Barnard's, executed at Lick in\r\n1894-95,[1113] showed no sensible divergence from them. Hence, much\r\nweight cannot be laid upon Huygens's drawings and descriptions, which\r\nhad been held to prove conclusively a partial filling up, since 1657, of\r\nthe interval between the ring and the planet.[1114]\r\n\r\nThe rings of Saturn replace, in Professor G. H. Darwin's view,[1115] an\r\nabortive satellite, scattered by tidal action into annular form. For\r\nthey lie closer to the planet than is consistent with the integrity of a\r\nrevolving body of reasonable bulk. The limit of possible existence for\r\nsuch a mass was fixed by Roche of Montpellier, in 1848,[1116] at 2·44\r\nmean radii of its primary; while the outer edge of the ring-system is\r\ndistant 2·38 radii of Saturn from his centre. The virtual discovery of\r\nits pulverulent condition dates, then, according to Professor Darwin,\r\nfrom 1848. He conjectures that the appendage will eventually disappear,\r\npartly through the dispersal of its constituent particles inward, and\r\ntheir subsidence upon the planet's surface, partly by their dispersal\r\noutward, to a region beyond \"Roche's limit,\" where coalescence might\r\nproceed unhindered by the strain of unequal attractions. One modest\r\nsatellite, revolving inside Mimas, would then be all that was left of\r\nthe singular appurtenances we now contemplate with admiration.\r\n\r\nThere seems reason to admit that Kirkwood's law of commensurability has\r\nhad some effect in bringing about the present distribution of the matter\r\ncomposing them. Here the influential bodies are Saturn's moons, while\r\nthe divisions and boundaries of the rings represent the spaces where\r\ntheir disturbing action conspires to eliminate revolving particles.\r\nKirkwood, in fact, showed, in 1867,[1117] that a body circulating in the\r\nchasm between the bright rings known as \"Cassini's division,\" would have\r\na period nearly commensurable with those of _four_ out of the eight\r\nmoons; and Meyer of Geneva subsequently calculated all such\r\ncombinations, with the result of bringing out coincidences between\r\nregions of maximum perturbation and the limiting and dividing lines of\r\nthe system.[1118] This is in itself a strong confirmation of the view\r\nthat the rings are made up of independently revolving small bodies.\r\n\r\nOn December 7, 1876, Professor Asaph Hall discovered at Washington a\r\nbright equatorial spot on Saturn, which he followed and measured through\r\nabove sixty rotations, each performed in ten hours fourteen minutes\r\ntwenty-four seconds.[1119] This, he was careful to add, represented the\r\nperiod, not necessarily of the _planet_, but only of the individual\r\nspot. The only previous determination of Saturn's axial movement\r\n(setting aside some insecure estimates by Schröter) was Herschel's in\r\n1794, giving a period of ten hours sixteen minutes. The substantial\r\naccuracy of Hall's result was verified by Mr. Denning in 1891.[1120] In\r\nMay and June of that year, ten vague bright markings near the equator\r\nwere watched by Mr. Stanley Williams, who derived from them a rotation\r\nperiod only two seconds shorter than that determined at Washington.\r\nNevertheless, similarly placed spots gave in 1892 and 1893 notably\r\nquicker rates;[1121] so that the task of timing the general drift of the\r\nSaturnian surface by the displacements of such objects is hampered, to\r\nan indefinite extent, by their individual proper motions.\r\n\r\nSaturn's outermost satellite, Japetus, is markedly variable--so variable\r\nthat it sends us, when brightest, just 4-1/2 times as much light as when\r\nfaintest. Moreover, its fluctuations depend upon its orbital position in\r\nsuch a way as to make it a conspicuous telescopic object when west, a\r\nscarcely discernible one when east of the planet. Herschel's\r\ninference[1122] of a partially obscured globe turning always the same\r\nface towards its primary seems the only admissible one, and is confirmed\r\nby Pickering's measurements of the varying intensity of its light. He\r\nremarked further that the dusky and brilliant hemispheres must be so\r\nposited as to divide the disc, viewed from Saturn, into nearly equal\r\nparts; so that this Saturnian moon, even when \"full,\" appears very\r\nimperfectly illuminated over one-half of its surface.[1123]\r\n\r\nZöllner estimated the albedo of Saturn at 0·51, Müller at 0·88, a value\r\nimpossibly high, considering that the spectrum includes no vestige of\r\noriginal emissions. Closely similar to that of Jupiter, it shows the\r\ndistinctive dark line in the red (wave-length 618), which we may call\r\nthe \"red-star line\"; and Janssen, from the summit of Etna in 1867[1124]\r\nfound traces in it of aqueous absorption. The light from the ring\r\nappears to be pure reflected sunshine unmodified by original atmospheric\r\naction.[1125]\r\n\r\nUranus, when favourably situated, can easily be seen with the naked eye\r\nas a star between the fifth and sixth magnitudes. There is indeed, some\r\nreason to suppose that he had been detected as a wandering orb by savage\r\n\"watchers of the skies\" in the Pacific long before he swam into\r\nHerschel's ken. Nevertheless, inquiries into his physical habitudes are\r\nstill in an early stage. They are exceedingly difficult of execution,\r\neven with the best and largest modern telescopes; and their results\r\nremain clouded with uncertainty.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that Uranus presents the unusual spectacle of a\r\nsystem of satellites travelling nearly at right angles to the plane of\r\nthe ecliptic. The existence of this anomaly gives a special interest to\r\ninvestigations of his axial movement, which might be presumed, from the\r\nanalogy of the other planets, to be executed in the same tilted plane.\r\nYet this is far from being certainly the case.\r\n\r\nMr. Buffham in 1870-72 caught traces of bright markings on the Uranian\r\ndisc, doubtfully suggesting a rotation in about twelve hours in a plane\r\n_not_ coincident with that in which his satellites circulate.[1126]\r\nDusky bands resembling those of Jupiter, but very faint, were barely\r\nperceptible to Professor Young at Princeton in 1883. Yet, though almost\r\nnecessarily inferred to be equatorial, they made a considerable angle\r\nwith the trend of the satellites' orbits.[1127] More distinctly by the\r\nbrothers Henry, with the aid of their fine refractor, two gray parallel\r\nrulings, separated by a brilliant zone, were discerned every clear night\r\nat Paris from January to June, 1884.[1128] What were taken to be the\r\npolar regions appeared comparatively dusky. The direction of the\r\nequatorial rulings (for so we may safely call them) made an angle of 40°\r\nwith the satellites' line of travel. Similar observations were made at\r\nNice by MM. Perrotin and Thollon, March to June, 1884, a lucid spot near\r\nthe equator, in addition, indicating rotation in a period of about ten\r\nhours.[1129] The discrepancy was, however, considerably reduced by\r\nPerrotin's study of the planet in 1889 with the new 30-inch\r\nequatoreal.[1130] The dark bands, thus viewed to better advantage than\r\nin 1884, appeared to deviate no more than 10° from the satellites'\r\norbit-plane. No definitive results, on the other hand, were derived by\r\nProfessors Holden, Schaeberle, and Keeler from their observations of\r\nUranus in 1889-90 with the potent instrument on Mount Hamilton.\r\nShadings, it is true, were almost always, though faintly, seen; but they\r\nappeared under an anomalous, possibly an illusory aspect. They\r\nconsisted, not of parallel, but of forked bands.[1131]\r\n\r\nMeasurements of the little sea-green disc which represents to us the\r\nmassive bulk of Uranus, by Young, Schiaparelli,[1132] Safarik, H. C.\r\nWilson[1133] and Perrotin, prove it to be quite distinctly _bulged_. The\r\ncompression at once caught Barnard's trained eye in 1894,[1134] when he\r\nundertook at Lick a micrometrical investigation of the system; and he\r\nwas surprised to perceive that the major axis of the elliptical surface\r\nmade an angle of about 28° with the line of travel pursued by the\r\nsatellites. Nothing more can be learned on this curious subject for some\r\nyears, since the pole of the planet is just now turned nearly towards\r\nthe earth; but Barnard's conclusion is unlikely to be seriously\r\nmodified. He fixed the mean diameter of Uranus at 34,900 miles. But this\r\nestimate was materially reduced through Dr. See's elimination of\r\nirradiative effects by means of daylight measures, executed at\r\nWashington in 1901.[1135]\r\n\r\nThe visual spectrum of this planet was first examined by Father Secchi\r\nin 1869, and later, with more advantages for accuracy, by Huggins,\r\nVogel,[1136] and Keeler.[1137] It is a very remarkable one. In lieu of\r\nthe reflected Fraunhofer lines, imperceptible perhaps through feebleness\r\nof light, six broad bands of original absorption appear, one\r\ncorresponding to the blue-green ray of hydrogen (F), another to the\r\n\"red-star line\" of Jupiter and Saturn, the rest as yet unidentified. The\r\nhydrogen band seems much too strong and diffuse to be the mere echo of a\r\nsolar line, and might accordingly be held to imply the presence of free\r\nhydrogen in the Uranian atmosphere. This, however, would be difficult of\r\nreconcilement with Keeler's identification of an absorption-group in the\r\nyellow with a telluric waterband.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding its high albedo--0·62, according to Zöllner--proof is\r\nwanting that any of the light of Uranus is inherent. Mr. Albert Taylor\r\nannounced, indeed, in 1889, his detection, with Common's giant\r\nreflector, of bright flutings in its spectrum;[1138] but Professor\r\nKeeler's examination proved them to be merely contrast effects.[1139]\r\nSir William and Lady Huggins, moreover, obtained about the same time a\r\nphotograph purely solar in character. The spectrum it represented was\r\ncrossed by numerous Fraunhofer lines, and by no others. It was, then,\r\npresumably composed entirely of reflected light.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJudging from the indications of an almost evanescent spectrum, Neptune,\r\nas regards physical condition, is the twin of Uranus, as Saturn of\r\nJupiter. Of the circumstances of his rotation we are as good as\r\ncompletely ignorant. Mr. Maxwell Hall, indeed, noticed at Jamaica, in\r\nNovember and December, 1883, certain rhythmical fluctuations of\r\nbrightness, suggesting revolution on an axis in slightly less than eight\r\nhours;[1140] but Professor Pickering reduces the supposed variability to\r\nan amount altogether too small for certain perception, and Dr. G. Müller\r\ndenies its existence _in toto_. It is true their observations were not\r\nprecisely contemporaneous with those of Mr. Hall[1141] who believes the\r\npartial obscurations recorded by himself to have been of a passing kind,\r\nand to have suddenly ceased after a fortnight of prevalence. Their less\r\nconspicuous renewal was visible to him in November, 1884, confirming a\r\nrotation period of 7·92 hours.\r\n\r\nIt was ascertained at first by indirect means that the orbit of\r\nNeptune's satellite is inclined about 20° to his equator. Mr.\r\nMarth[1142] having drawn attention to the rapid shifting of its plane of\r\nmotion, M. Tisserand and Professor Newcomb[1143] independently published\r\nthe conclusion that such shifting necessarily results from Neptune's\r\nellipsoidal shape. The movement is of the kind exemplified--although\r\nwith inverted relations--in the precession of the equinoxes. The pole of\r\nthe satellite, owing to the pull of Neptune's equatorial protuberance,\r\ndescribes a circle round the pole of his equator in a retrograde\r\ndirection, and in a period of over five hundred years. The amount of\r\ncompression indicated for the primary body is, at the outside, 1/85;\r\nwhence it can be inferred that Neptune possesses a lower rotatory\r\nvelocity than the other giant planets. Direct verification of the trend\r\ntheoretically inferred for the satellite's movement was obtained by Dr.\r\nSee in 1899. The Washington 26-inch refractor disclosed to him, under\r\nexceptionally favourable conditions, a set of equatorial belts on the\r\ndisc of Neptune, and they took just the direction prescribed by theory.\r\nTheir objective reality cannot be doubted, although Barnard was unable,\r\neither with the Lick or the Yerkes telescope,[1144] to detect any\r\ndefinite markings on this planet. Its diameter was found by him to be\r\n32,900 miles.\r\n\r\nThe possibility that Neptune may not be the most remote body circling\r\nround the sun has been contemplated ever since he has been known to\r\nexist. Within the last few years the position at a given epoch of a\r\nplanet far beyond his orbital verge has been approximately fixed by two\r\nseparate investigators.\r\n\r\nProfessor George Forbes of Edinburgh adopted in 1880 a novel plan of\r\nsearch for unknown members of the solar system, the first idea of which\r\nwas thrown out by M. Flammarion in November, 1879.[1145] It depends upon\r\nthe movements of comets. It is well known that those of moderately short\r\nperiods are, for a reason already explained, connected with the larger\r\nplanets in such a way that the cometary aphelia fall near some planetary\r\norbit. Jupiter claims a large retinue of such partial dependents,\r\nNeptune owns six, and there are two considerable groups, the farthest\r\ndistances of which from the sun lie respectively near 100 and 300 times\r\nthat of the earth. At each of these vast intervals, one involving a\r\nperiod of 1,000, the other of 5,000 years, Professor Forbes maintains\r\nthat an unseen planet circulates. He even computed elements for the\r\nnearer of the two, and fixed its place on the celestial sphere;[1146]\r\nbut the photographic searches made for it by Dr. Roberts at Crowborough\r\nand by Mr. Wilson at Daramona proved unavailing. Undeterred by\r\nDeichmüller's discouraging opinion that cometary orbits extending beyond\r\nthe recognised bounds of the solar system are too imperfectly known to\r\nserve as the basis of trustworthy conclusions,[1147] the Edinburgh\r\nProfessor returned to the attack in 1901.[1148] He now sought to prove\r\nthat the lost comet of 1556 actually returned in 1844, but with elements\r\nso transformed by ultra-Neptunian perturbations as to have escaped\r\nimmediate identification. If so, the \"wanted\" planet has just entered\r\nthe sign Libra, and, being larger than Jupiter, should be possible to\r\nfind.\r\n\r\nAlmost simultaneously with Forbes, Professor Todd set about groping for\r\nthe same object by the help of a totally different set of indications.\r\nAdams's approved method commended itself to him; but the hypothetical\r\ndivagations of Neptune having scarcely yet had time to develop, he was\r\nthrown back upon the \"residual errors\" of Uranus. They gave him a\r\nvirtually identical situation for the new planet with that derived from\r\nthe clustering of cometary aphelia.[1149] Yet its assigned distance was\r\nlittle more than half that of the nearer of Professor Forbes's remote\r\npair, and it completed a revolution in 375 instead of 1,000 years. The\r\nagreement in them between the positions determined, on separate grounds,\r\nfor the ultra-Neptunian traveller was merely an odd coincidence; nor can\r\nwe be certain, until it is seen, that we have really got into touch with\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 965: _Phil.

To set\r\nourselves to inquire what that process was may be an audacity, but it is\r\na legitimate, nay, an inevitable one. For man's implanted instinct to\r\n\"look before and after\" does not apply to his own little life alone, but\r\nregards the whole history of creation, from the highest to the\r\nlowest--from the microscopic germ of an alga or a fungus to the visible\r\nframe and furniture of the heavens.\r\n\r\nKant considered that the inquiry into the mode of origin of the world\r\nwas one of the easiest problems set by Nature; but it cannot be said\r\nthat his own solution of it was satisfactory. He, however, struck out in\r\n1755 a track which thought still pursues. In his _Allgemeine\r\nNaturgeschichte_ the growth of sun and planets was traced from the\r\ncradle of a vast and formless mass of evenly diffused particles, and the\r\nuniformity of their movements was sought to be accounted for by the\r\nunvarying action of attractive and repulsive forces, under the dominion\r\nof which their development was carried forward.\r\n\r\nIn its modern form, the \"Nebular Hypothesis\" made its appearance in\r\n1796.[1150] It was presented by Laplace with diffidence, as a\r\nspeculation unfortified by numerical buttresses of any kind, yet with\r\nvisible exultation at having, as he thought, penetrated the birth-secret\r\nof our system. He demanded, indeed, more in the way of postulates than\r\nKant had done. He started with a sun ready made,[1151] and surrounded\r\nwith a vast glowing atmosphere, extending into space out beyond the\r\norbit of the farthest planet, and endowed with a slow rotatory motion.\r\nAs this atmosphere or nebula cooled, it contracted; and as it\r\ncontracted, its rotation, by a well-known mechanical law, became\r\naccelerated. At last a point arrived when tangential velocity at the\r\nequator increased beyond the power of gravity to control, and\r\nequilibrium was restored by the separation of a nebulous ring revolving\r\nin the same period as the generating mass. After a time, the ring broke\r\nup into fragments, all eventually reunited in a single revolving and\r\nrotating body. This was the first and farthest planet.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the parent nebula continued to shrink and whirl quicker and\r\nquicker, passing, as it did so, through successive crises of\r\ninstability, each resulting in, and terminated by, the formation of a\r\nplanet, at a smaller distance from the centre, and with a shorter period\r\nof revolution than its predecessor. In these secondary bodies the same\r\nprocess was repeated on a reduced scale, the birth of satellites ensuing\r\nupon their contraction, or not, according to circumstances. Saturn's\r\nring, it was added, afforded a striking confirmation of the theory of\r\nannular separation,[1152] and appeared to have survived in its original\r\nform in order to throw light on the genesis of the whole solar system;\r\nwhile the four first discovered asteroids offered an example in which\r\nthe _débris_ of a shattered ring had failed to coalesce into a single\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\nThis scene of cosmical evolution was a characteristic bequest from the\r\neighteenth century to the nineteenth. It possessed the self-sufficing\r\nsymmetry and entireness appropriate to the ideas of a time of\r\nrenovation, when the complexity of nature was little accounted of in\r\ncomparison with the imperious orderliness of the thoughts of man. Since\r\nits promulgation, however, knowledge has transgressed many boundaries,\r\nand set at naught much ingenious theorising. How has it fared with\r\nLaplace's sketch of the origin of the world? It has at least not been\r\ndiscarded as effete. The groundwork of speculation on the subject is\r\nstill furnished by it. It is, nevertheless, admittedly inadequate. Of\r\nmuch that exists it gives no account, or an erroneous one. The march of\r\nevents certainly did not everywhere--even if it did anywhere--follow the\r\nexact path prescribed for it. Yet modern science attempts to supplement,\r\nbut scarcely ventures to supersede it.\r\n\r\nThought has, in many directions, been profoundly modified by Mayer's and\r\nJoule's discovery, in 1842, of the equivalence between heat and motion.\r\nIts corollary was the grand idea of the \"conservation of energy,\" now\r\none of the cardinal principles of science. This means that, under the\r\nordinary circumstances of observation, the old maxim _ex nihilo nihil\r\nfit_ applies to force as well as to matter. The supplies of heat, light,\r\nelectricity, must be kept up, or the stream will cease to flow. The\r\nquestion of the maintenance of the sun's heat was thus inevitably\r\nraised; and with the question of maintenance that of origin is\r\nindissolubly connected.\r\n\r\nDr. Julius Robert Mayer, a physician residing at Heilbronn, was the\r\nfirst to apply the new light to the investigation of what Sir John\r\nHerschel had termed the \"great secret.\" He showed that if the sun were a\r\nbody either simply cooling or in a state of combustion, it must long\r\nsince have \"gone out.\" Had an equal mass of coal been set alight four or\r\nfive centuries after the building of the Pyramid of Cheops, and kept\r\nburning at such a rate as to supply solar light and heat during the\r\ninterim, only a few cinders would now remain in lieu of our undiminished\r\nglorious orb. Mayer looked round for an alternative. He found it in the\r\n\"meteoric hypothesis\" of solar conservation.[1153] The importance in the\r\neconomy of our system of the bodies known as falling stars was then (in\r\n1848) beginning to be recognised. It was known that they revolved in\r\ncountless swarms round the sun; that the earth daily encountered\r\nmillions of them; and it was surmised that the cone of the zodiacal\r\nlight represented their visible condensation towards the attractive\r\ncentre. From the zodiacal light, then, Mayer derived the store needed\r\nfor supporting the sun's radiations. He proved that, by the stoppage of\r\ntheir motion through falling into the sun, bodies would evolve from\r\n4,600 to 9,200 times as much heat (according to their ultimate velocity)\r\nas would result from the burning of equal masses of coal, their\r\nprecipitation upon the sun's surface being brought about by the\r\nresisting medium observed to affect the revolutions of Encke's comet.\r\nThere was, however, a difficulty. The quantity of matter needed to keep,\r\nby the sacrifice of its movement, the hearth of our system warm and\r\nbright would be very considerable. Mayer's lowest estimate put it at\r\n94,000 billion kilogrammes per second, or a mass equal to that of our\r\nmoon bi-annually. But so large an addition to the gravitating power of\r\nthe sun would quickly become sensible in the movement of the bodies\r\ndependent upon him. Their revolutions would be notably accelerated.\r\nMayer admitted that each year would be shorter than the previous one by\r\na not insignificant fraction of a second, and postulated an unceasing\r\nwaste of substance, such as Newton had supposed must accompany emission\r\nof the material corpuscles of light, to neutralise continual\r\nreinforcement.\r\n\r\nMayer's views obtained a very small share of publicity, and owned Mr.\r\nWaterston as their independent author in this country. The meteoric, or\r\n\"dynamical,\" theory of solar sustentation was expounded by him before\r\nthe British Association in 1853. It was developed with his usual ability\r\nby Lord Kelvin, in the following year. The inflow of meteorites, he\r\nremarked, \"is the only one of all conceivable causes of solar heat which\r\nwe know to exist from independent evidence.\"[1154] We know it to exist,\r\nbut we now also know it to be entirely insufficient. The supplies\r\npresumed to be contained in the zodiacal light would be quickly\r\nexhausted; a constant inflow from space would be needed to meet the\r\ndemand. But if moving bodies were drawn into the sun at anything like\r\nthe required rate, the air, even out here at ninety-three millions of\r\nmiles distance, would be thick with them; the earth would be red-hot\r\nfrom their impacts;[1155] geological deposits would be largely\r\nmeteoric;[1156] to say nothing of the effects on the mechanism of the\r\nheavens. Lord Kelvin himself urged the inadmissibility of the\r\n\"extra-planetary\" theory of meteoric supply on the very tangible ground\r\nthat, if it were true, the year would be shorter now, actually by six\r\nweeks, than at the opening of the Christian era. The \"intra-planetary\"\r\nsupply, however, is too scanty to be anything more than a temporary\r\nmakeshift.\r\n\r\nThe meteoric hypothesis was naturally extended from the maintenance of\r\nthe sun's heat to the formation of the bodies circling round him. The\r\nearth--no less doubtless than the other planets--is still growing.\r\nCosmical matter in the shape of falling stars and aërolites, to the\r\namount, adopting Professor Newton's estimate, of 100 tons daily, is\r\nswept up by it as it pursues its orbital round. Inevitably the idea\r\nsuggested itself that this process of appropriation gives the key to the\r\nlife-history of our globe, and that the momentary streak of fire in the\r\nsummer sky represents a feeble survival of the glowing hailstorm by\r\nwhich in old times it was fashioned and warmed. Mr. E. W. Brayley\r\nsupported this view of planetary production in 1864,[1157] and it has\r\nrecommended itself to Haidinger, Helmholtz, Proctor, and Faye. But the\r\nnegative evidence of geological deposits appears fatal to it.\r\n\r\nThe theory of solar energy now generally regarded as the true one was\r\nenounced by Helmholtz in a popular lecture in 1854. It depends upon the\r\nsame principle of the equivalence of heat and motion which had suggested\r\nthe meteoric hypothesis. But here the movement surrendered and\r\ntransformed belongs to the particles, not of any foreign bodies, but of\r\nthe sun itself. Drawn together from a wide ambit by the force of their\r\nown gravity, their fall towards the sun's centre must have engendered a\r\nvast thermal store, of which 453/454 are computed to be already spent.\r\nPresumably, however, this stream of reinforcement is still flowing. In\r\nthe very act of parting with heat, the sun develops a fresh stock. His\r\nradiations, in short, are the direct result of shrinkage through\r\ncooling. A diminution of the solar diameter by 380 feet yearly would\r\njust suffice to cover the present rate of emission, and would for ages\r\nremain imperceptible with our means of observation, since, after the\r\nlapse of 6,000 years, the lessening of angular size would scarcely\r\namount to one second.[1158] But the process, though not terminated, is\r\nstrictly a terminable one. In less than five million years, the sun will\r\nhave contracted to half its present bulk. In seven million more, it will\r\nbe as dense as the earth. It is difficult to believe that it will then\r\nbe a luminous body.[1159] Nor can an unlimited past duration be\r\nadmitted. Helmholtz considered that radiation might have gone on with\r\nits actual intensity for twenty-two, Langley allows only eighteen\r\nmillion years. The period can scarcely be stretched, by the most\r\ngenerous allowances, to double the latter figure. But this is far from\r\nmeeting the demands of geologists and biologists.\r\n\r\nAn attempt was made in 1881 to supply the sun with machinery analogous\r\nto that of a regenerative furnace, enabling it to consume the same fuel\r\nover and over again, and so to prolong indefinitely its beneficent\r\nexistence. The inordinate \"waste\" of energy, which shocks our thrifty\r\nideas, was simultaneously abolished. The earth stops and turns variously\r\nto account one 2,250-millionth part of the solar radiations; each of the\r\nother planets and satellites takes a proportionate share; the rest,\r\nbeing all but an infinitesmal fraction of the whole, is dissipated\r\nthrough endless space, to serve what purpose we know not. Now, on the\r\nlate Sir William Siemens's plan, this reckless expenditure would cease;\r\nthe solar incomings and outgoings would be regulated on approved\r\neconomic principles, and the inevitable final bankruptcy would be staved\r\noff to remote ages.\r\n\r\nBut there was a fatal flaw in its construction. He imagined a perpetual\r\ncirculation of combustible materials, alternately surrendering and\r\nregaining chemical energy, the round being kept going by the motive\r\nforce of the sun's rotation.[1160] This, however, was merely to perch\r\nthe globe upon a tortoise, while leaving the tortoise in the air. The\r\nsun's rotation contains a certain definite amount of mechanical\r\npower--enough, according to Lord Kelvin, if directly converted into\r\nheat, to keep up the sun's emission during 116 years and six days--a\r\nmere moment in cosmical time. More economically applied, it would no\r\ndoubt go farther. Its exhaustion would, nevertheless, under the most\r\nfavourable circumstances, ensue in a comparatively short period.[1161]\r\nMany other objections equally unanswerable have been urged to the\r\n\"regenerative\" hypothesis, but this one suffices.\r\n\r\nDr. Croll's collision hypothesis[1162] is less demonstrably unsound, but\r\nscarcely less unsatisfactory. By the mutual impact of two dark masses\r\nrushing together with tremendous speed, he sought to provide the solar\r\nnebula with an immense _original_ stock of heat for the reinforcement of\r\nthat subsequently evolved in the course of its progressive contraction.\r\nThe sun, while still living on its capital, would thus have a larger\r\ncapital to live on, and the time-demands of the less exacting geologists\r\nand biologists might be successfully met. But the primitive event,\r\nassumed for the purpose of dispensing them from the inconvenience of\r\n\"hurrying up their phenomena,\" is not one that a sane judgment can\r\nreadily admit to have ever, in point of actual fact, happened.\r\n\r\nThere remains, then, as the only intelligible rationale of solar\r\nsustentation, Helmholtz's shrinkage theory. And this has a very\r\nimportant bearing upon the nebular view of planetary formation; it may,\r\nin fact, be termed its complement. For it involves the idea that the\r\nsun's materials, once enormously diffused, gradually condensed to their\r\npresent volume with development of heat and light, and, it may plausibly\r\nbe added, with the separation of dependent globes. The data furnished by\r\nspectrum analysis, too, favour the supposition of a common origin for\r\nsun and planets by showing their community of substance; while gaseous\r\nnebulæ present examples of vast masses of tenuous vapour, such as our\r\nsystem may plausibly be conjectured to have primitively sprung from.\r\n\r\nBut recent science raises many objections to the details, if it supplies\r\nsome degree of confirmation to the fundamental idea of Laplace's\r\ncosmogony. The detection of the retrograde movement of Neptune's\r\nsatellite made it plain that the anomalous conditions of the Uranian\r\nworld were due to no extraordinary disturbance, but to a systematic\r\nvariety of arrangement at the outskirts of the solar domain. So that,\r\nwere a trans-Neptunian planet discovered, we should be fully prepared to\r\nfind it rotating, and surrounded by satellites circulating from east to\r\nwest. The uniformity of movement, upon the probabilities connected with\r\nwhich the French geometer mainly based his scheme, thus at once\r\nvanishes.\r\n\r\nThe excessively rapid revolution of the inner Martian moon is a further\r\nstumbling-block. On Laplace's view, _no_ satellite can revolve in a\r\nshorter time than its primary rotates; for in its period of circulation\r\nsurvives the period of rotation of the parent mass which filled the\r\nsphere of its orbit at the time of giving it birth. And rotation\r\nquickens as contraction goes on; therefore, the older time of axial\r\nrotation should invariably be the longer. This obstacle can, however, as\r\nwe shall presently see, be turned.\r\n\r\nMore serious is one connected with the planetary periods, pointed out by\r\nBabinet in 1861.[1163] In order to make them fit in with the hypothesis\r\nof successive separation from a rotating and contracting body, certain\r\narbitrary assumptions have to be made of fluctuations in the\r\ndistribution of the matter forming that body at the various epochs of\r\nseparation.[1164] Such expedients usually merit the distrust which they\r\ninspire. Primitive and permanent irregularities of density in the solar\r\nnebula, such as Miss Young's calculations suggest,[1165] do not, on the\r\nother hand, appear intrinsically improbable.\r\n\r\nAgain, it was objected by Professor Kirkwood in 1869[1166] that there\r\ncould be no sufficient cohesion in such an enormously diffused mass as\r\nthe planets are supposed to have sprung from to account for the wide\r\nintervals between them. The matter separated through the growing excess\r\nof centrifugal speed would have been cast off, not by rarely recurring\r\nefforts, but continually, fragmentarily, _pari passu_ with condensation\r\nand acceleration. Each wisp of nebula, as it found itself unduly\r\nhurried, would have declared its independence, and set about revolving\r\nand condensing on its own account. The result would have been a\r\nmeteoric, not a planetary system.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it is a question whether the relative ages of the planets do\r\nnot follow an order just the reverse of that concluded by Laplace.\r\nProfessor Newcomb holds the opinion that the rings which eventually\r\nconstituted the planets divided from the main body of the nebula almost\r\nsimultaneously, priority, if there were any, being on the side of the\r\ninner and smaller ones;[1167] while in M. Faye's cosmogony,[1168] the\r\nretrograde motion of the systems formed by the two outer planets is\r\nascribed--on grounds, it is true, of dubious validity--to their\r\ncomparatively late origin.\r\n\r\nThis ingenious scheme was designed, not merely to complete, but to\r\nsupersede that of Laplace, which, undoubtedly, through the inclusion by\r\nour system of oppositely directed rotations, forfeits its claim simply\r\nand singly to account for the fundamental peculiarities of its\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nM. Faye's leading contention is that, under the circumstances assumed by\r\nLaplace, not the two outer planets alone, but the whole company must\r\nhave been possessed of retrograde rotation. For they were formed--_ex\r\nhypothesi_--after the sun; central condensation had reached an advanced\r\nstage when the rings they were derived from separated; the principle of\r\ninverse squares consequently held good, and Kepler's Laws were in full\r\noperation. Now, particles circulating in obedience to these laws can\r\nonly--since their velocity decreases outward from the centre of\r\nattraction--coalesce into a globe with a _backward_ axial movement. Nor\r\nwas Laplace blind to this flaw in his theory; but his effort to remove\r\nit, though it passed muster for the best part of a century,[1169] was\r\nscarcely successful. His planet-forming rings were made to rotate _all\r\nin one piece_, their outer parts thus necessarily travelling at a\r\nswifter linear rate than their inner parts, and eventually uniting,\r\nequally of necessity, into a _forward_-spinning body. The strength of\r\ncohesion involved may, however, safely be called impossible, especially\r\nwhen it is considered that nebulous materials were in question.\r\n\r\nThe reform proposed by M. Faye consists in admitting that all the\r\nplanets inside Uranus are of pre-solar origin--that they took globular\r\nform in the bosom of a nearly homogeneous nebula, revolving in a single\r\nperiod, with motion accelerated from centre to circumference, and hence\r\nagglomerating into masses with a direct rotation. Uranus and Neptune owe\r\ntheir exceptional characteristics to their later birth. When they came\r\ninto existence, the development of the sun was already far advanced,\r\ncentral force had acquired virtually its present strength, unity of\r\nperiod had been abolished by its predominance, and motion was retarded\r\noutward.\r\n\r\nThus, what we may call the relative chronology of the solar system is\r\nthrown once more into confusion. The order of seniority of the planets\r\nis now no easier to determine than the \"Who first, who last?\" among the\r\nvictims of Hector's spear. For M. Faye's arrangements, notwithstanding\r\nthe skill with which he has presented them, cannot be unreservedly\r\naccepted. The objections to them, thoughtfully urged by M. C. Wolf[1170]\r\nand Professor Darwin,[1171] are grave. Not the least so is his omission\r\nto take account of an agency of change presently to be noticed.\r\n\r\nA further valuable discussion of the matter was published by M. du\r\nLigondès in 1897.[1172] His views are those of Faye, modified to disarm\r\nthe criticisms they had encountered; and special attention may be\r\nclaimed for his weighty remark that each planet has a life-history of\r\nits own, essentially distinct from those of the others, and, despite\r\noriginal unity, not to be confounded with them. The drift of recent\r\ninvestigations seems, indeed, to be to find the embryonic solar system\r\nalready potentially complete in the parent nebula, like the oak in an\r\nacorn, and to relegate detailed explanations of its peculiarities to the\r\ndim pre-nebular fore-time.\r\n\r\nWe now come to a most remarkable investigation--one, indeed, unique in\r\nits profession to lead us back with mathematical certainty towards the\r\norigin of a heavenly body. We refer to Professor Darwin's inquiries into\r\nthe former relations of the earth and moon.[1173]\r\n\r\nThey deal exclusively with the effects of tidal friction, and primarily\r\nwith those resulting, not from oceanic, but from \"bodily\" tides, such as\r\nthe sun and moon must have raised in past ages on a liquid or viscous\r\nearth. The immediate effect of either is, as already explained, to\r\ndestroy the rotation of the body on which the tide is raised, as regards\r\nthe tide-raising body, bringing it to turn always the same face towards\r\nits disturber. This, we can see, has been completely brought about in\r\nthe case of the moon. There is, however, a secondary or reactive effect.\r\nAction is always mutual. Precisely as much as the moon pulls the\r\nterrestrial tidal wave backward, the tidal wave pulls the moon forward.\r\nBut pulling a body forward in its orbit implies the enlargement of that\r\norbit; in other words, the moon is, as a consequence of tidal friction,\r\nvery slowly receding from the earth. This will go on (other\r\ncircumstances remaining unchanged) until the lengthening day overtakes\r\nthe more tardily lengthening month, when each will be of about 1,400\r\nhours.[1174] A position of what we may call tidal equilibrium between\r\nearth and moon will (apart from disturbance by other bodies) then be\r\nattained.\r\n\r\nIf, however, it be true that, in the time to come, the moon will be much\r\nfarther from us, it follows that in the time past she was much nearer to\r\nus than she now is. Tracing back her history by the aid of Professor\r\nDarwin's clue, we at length find her revolving in a period of somewhere\r\nbetween two and four hours, almost in contact with an earth rotating\r\njust at the same rate. This was before tidal friction had begun its work\r\nof grinding down axial velocity and expanding orbital range. But the\r\nposition was not one of stable equilibrium. The slightest inequality\r\nmust have set on foot a series of uncompensated changes. If the moon had\r\nwhirled the least iota faster than the earth spun she must have been\r\nprecipitated upon it. Her actual existence shows that the trembling\r\nbalance inclined the other way. By a second or two to begin with, the\r\nmonth exceeded the day; the tidal wave crept ahead of the moon; tidal\r\nfriction came into play, and our satellite started on its long spiral\r\njourney outward from the parent globe. This must have occurred, it is\r\ncomputed, _at least_ fifty-four million years ago.\r\n\r\nThat this kind of tidal reactive effect played its part in bringing the\r\nmoon into its present position, and is still, to some slight extent, at\r\nwork in changing it, there can be no doubt whatever. An irresistible\r\nconjecture carried the explorer of its rigidly deducible consequences\r\none step beyond them. The moon's time of revolution, when so near the\r\nearth as barely to escape contact with it, must have been, by Kepler's\r\nLaw, more than two and less than two and a half hours. Now it happens\r\nthat the most rapid rate of rotation of a fluid mass of the earth's\r\naverage density, consistent with spheroidal equilibrium, is two hours\r\nand twenty minutes. Quicken the movement but by one second and the globe\r\nmust fly asunder. Hence the inference that the earth actually _did_ fly\r\nasunder through over-fast spinning, the ensuing disruption representing\r\nthe birth-throes of the moon. It is likely that the event was hastened\r\nor helped by solar tidal disturbance.\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate. Analysis tracks backward the two bodies until it leaves\r\nthem in very close contiguity, one rotating and the other revolving in\r\napproximately the same time, and that time certainly not far different\r\nfrom, and quite possibly identical with, the critical period of\r\ninstability for the terrestrial spheroid. \"Is this,\" Professor Darwin\r\nasks, \"a mere coincidence, or does it not rather point to the break-up\r\nof the primeval planet into two masses in consequence of a too rapid\r\nrotation?\"[1175]\r\n\r\nWe are tempted, but are not allowed to give an unqualified assent. Mr.\r\nJames Nolan of Victoria has made it clear that the moon could not have\r\nsubsisted as a continuous mass under the powerful disruptive strain\r\nwhich would have acted upon it when revolving almost in contact with the\r\npresent surface of the earth; and Professor Darwin, admitting the\r\nobjection, concedes to our satellite, in its initial stage, the\r\nalternative form of a flock of meteorites.[1176] But such a congregation\r\nmust have been quickly dispersed, by tidal action, into a meteoric ring.\r\nThe same investigator subsequently fixed 6,500 miles from centre to\r\ncentre as the minimum distance at which the moon could have revolved in\r\nits entirety; and he concluded it \"necessary to suppose that, after the\r\nbirth of a satellite, if it takes place at all in this way, a series of\r\nchanges occur which are quite unknown.\"[1177] The evidence, however, for\r\nthe efficiency of tidal friction in bringing about the actual\r\nconfiguration of the lunar-terrestrial system is not invalidated by this\r\nfailure to penetrate its natal mystery. Under its influence the\r\nprincipal elements of that system fall into interdependent mutual\r\nrelations. It connects, casually and quantitatively, the periods of the\r\nmoon's revolution and of the earth's rotation, the obliquity of the\r\necliptic, the inclination and eccentricity of the lunar orbit. All this\r\ncan scarcely be accidental.\r\n\r\nProfessor Darwin's first researches on this subject were communicated to\r\nthe Royal Society, December 18, 1879. They were followed, January 20,\r\n1881,[1178] by an inquiry on the same principles into the earlier\r\ncondition of the entire solar system. The results were a warning against\r\nhasty generalisation. They showed that the lunar-terrestrial system, far\r\nfrom being a pattern for their development, was a singular exception\r\namong the bodies swayed by the sun. Its peculiarity resides in the fact\r\nthat the moon is _proportionately_ by far the most massive attendant\r\nupon any known planet. Its disturbing power over its primary is thus\r\nabnormally great, and tidal friction has, in consequence, played a\r\npredominant part in bringing their mutual relations into their present\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nThe comparatively late birth of the moon tends to ratify this inference.\r\nThe dimensions of the earth did not differ (according to our present\r\nauthority) very greatly from what they now are when her solitary\r\noffspring came, somehow, into existence. This is found not to have been\r\nthe case with any other of the planets. It is unlikely that the\r\nsatellites of Jupiter, Saturn, or Mars (we may safely add, of Uranus or\r\nNeptune) ever revolved in much narrower orbits than those they now\r\ntraverse; it is practically certain that they did not, like our moon,\r\noriginate very near the _present_ surfaces of their primaries.[1179]\r\nWhat follows? The tide-raising power of a body grows with vicinity in a\r\nrapidly accelerated ratio. Lunar tides must then have been on an\r\nenormous scale when the moon swung round at a fraction of its actual\r\ndistance from the earth. But no other satellite with which we are\r\nacquainted occupied at any time a corresponding position. Hence no other\r\nsatellite ever possessed tide-raising capabilities in the least\r\ncomparable to those of the moon. We conclude once more that tidal\r\nfriction had an influence here very different from its influence\r\nelsewhere. Quite possibly, however, that influence may be more nearly\r\nspent than in less advanced combinations of revolving globes. Mr. Nolan\r\nconcluded in 1895[1180] that it still retains appreciable efficacy in\r\nthe several domains of the outer planets. The moons of Jupiter and\r\nSaturn are, by his calculations, in course of sensible retreat, under\r\ncompulsion of the perennial ripples raised by them on the surfaces of\r\ntheir gigantic primaries. He thus connects the interior position of the\r\nfifth Jovian satellite with its small mass. The feebleness of its\r\ntide-raising power obliged it to remain behind its companions; for there\r\nis no sign of its being more juvenile than the Galilean quartette.\r\n\r\nThe yielding of plastic bodies to the strain of unequal attractions is a\r\nphenomenon of far-reaching consequence. We know that the sun as well as\r\nthe moon causes tides in our oceans. There must, then, be solar, no less\r\nthan lunar, tidal friction. The question at once arises: What part has\r\nit played in the development of the solar system? Has it ever been one\r\nof leading importance, or has its influence always been, as it now is,\r\nsubordinate, almost negligible? To this, too, Professor Darwin supplies\r\nan answer.\r\n\r\nIt can be stated without hesitation that the sun did _not_ give birth to\r\nthe planets, as the earth has been supposed to have given birth to the\r\nmoon, by the disruption of its already condensed, though viscous and\r\nglowing mass, pushing them then gradually backward from its surface into\r\ntheir present places. For the utmost possible increase in the length of\r\nthe year through tidal friction is one hour; and five minutes is a more\r\nprobable estimate.[1181] So far as the pull of tide-waves raised on the\r\nsun by the planets is concerned, then, the distances of the latter have\r\nnever been notably different from what they now are; though that cause\r\nmay have converted the paths traversed by them from circles into\r\nellipses.\r\n\r\nOver their _physical_ history, however, it was probably in a large\r\nmeasure influential. The first vital issue for each of them\r\nwas--satellites or no satellites? Were they to be governors as well as\r\ngoverned, or should they revolve in sterile isolation throughout the\r\næons of their future existence? Here there is strong reason to believe\r\nthat solar tidal friction was the overruling power. It is remarkable\r\nthat planetary fecundity increases--at least so far outward as\r\nSaturn--with distance from the sun. Can these two facts be in any way\r\nrelated? In other words, is there any conceivable way by which tidal\r\ninfluence could prevent or impede the throwingoff of secondary bodies?\r\nWe have only to think for a moment in order to see that this is\r\nprecisely one of its direct results.[1182]\r\n\r\nTidal friction, whether solar or lunar, tends to reduce the axial\r\nmovement of the body it acts upon. But the separation of satellites\r\ndepends--according to the received view--upon the attainment of a\r\ndisruptive rate of rotation. Hence, if solar tidal friction were strong\r\nenough to keep down the pace below this critical point, the contracting\r\nmass would remain intact--there would be no satellite-production. This,\r\nin all probability, actually occurred in the case both of Mercury and\r\nVenus. They cooled without dividing, because the solar friction-brake\r\napplied to them was too strong to permit acceleration to pass the limit\r\nof equilibrium. The complete destruction of their relative axial\r\nmovement has been rendered probable by recent observations; and that the\r\nprocess went on rapidly is a reasonable further inference. The earth\r\nbarely escaped the fate of loneliness incurred by her neighbours. Her\r\nfirst and only epoch of instability was retarded until she had nearly\r\nreached maturity. The late appearance of the moon accounts for its large\r\nrelative size--through the increased cohesion of an already strongly\r\ncondensed parent mass--and for the distinctive peculiarities of its\r\nhistory and influence on the producing globe.\r\n\r\nSolar tidal friction, although it did not hinder the formation of two\r\nminute dependents of Mars, has been invoked to explain the anomalously\r\nrapid revolution of one of them. Phobos, we have seen, completes more\r\nthan three revolutions while Mars rotates once. But this was probably\r\nnot always so. The two periods were originally nearly equal. The\r\ndifference, it is alleged, was brought about by tidal waves raised by\r\nthe sun on the semi-fluid spheroid of Mars. Rotatory velocity was\r\nthereby destroyed, the Martian day slowly lengthened, and, as a\r\nsecondary consequence, the period of the inner satellite, become shorter\r\nthan the augmented day, began progressively to diminish. So that Phobos,\r\nunlike our moon, was in the beginning farther from its primary than now.\r\n\r\nBut here again Mr. Nolan entered a _caveat_. Applying the simple test of\r\nnumerical evaluation, he showed that before solar tidal friction could\r\nlengthen the rotation-period of Mars by so much as one minute, Phobos\r\nshould have been precipitated upon its surface.[1183] For the enormous\r\ndisparity of mass between it and the sun is so far neutralised by the\r\nenormous disparity in their respective distances from Mars that solar\r\ntidal force there is only fifty times that of the little satellite. But\r\nthe tidal effects of a satellite circulating quicker than its primary\r\nrotates exactly reverse those of one moving, like our moon,\r\ncomparatively slowly, so that the tides raised by Phobos tend to\r\n_shorten_ both periods. Its orbital momentum, however, is so extremely\r\nsmall in proportion to the rotational momentum of Mars, that any\r\nperceptible inroad upon the latter is attended by a lavish and ruinous\r\nexpenditure of the former. It is as if a man owning a single five-pound\r\nnote were to play for equal stakes with a man possessing a million. The\r\nbankruptcy sure to ensue is typified by the coming fate of the Martian\r\ninner satellite. The catastrophe of its fall needs to bring it about\r\nonly a very feeble reactive pull compared with the friction which the\r\nsun should apply in order to protract the Martian day by one minute. And\r\nfrom the proportionate strength of the forces at work, it is quite\r\ncertain that one result cannot take place without the other. Nor can\r\nthings have been materially different in the past; hence the idea must\r\nbe abandoned that the primitive time of rotation of Mars survives in the\r\nperiod of its inner satellite.\r\n\r\nThe anomalous shortness of the latter may, however, in M. Wolf's\r\nopinion,[1184] be explained by the \"traînées elliptiques\" with which\r\nRoche supplemented nebular annulation.[1185] These are traced back to\r\nthe descent of separating strata from the _shoulders_ of the great\r\nnebulous spheroid towards its equatorial plane. Their rotational\r\nvelocity being thus relatively small, they formed \"inner rings,\" very\r\nmuch nearer to the centre of condensation than would have been possible\r\non the unmodified theory of Laplace. Phobos might, in this view, be\r\ncalled a polar offset of Mars; and the rings of Saturn are thought to\r\nown a similar origin.\r\n\r\nOutside the orbit of Mars, solar tidal friction can scarcely be said to\r\npossess at present any sensible power. But it is far from certain that\r\nthis was always so. It seems not unlikely that its influence was the\r\noverruling one in determining the direction of planetary rotation. M.\r\nFaye, as we have seen, objected to Laplace's scheme that only retrograde\r\nsecondary systems could be produced by it. In this he was anticipated by\r\nKirkwood, who, however, supplied an answer to his own objection.[1186]\r\n\r\nSun-raised tides must have acted with great power on the diffused masses\r\nof the embryo planets. By their means they doubtless very soon came to\r\nturn (in lunar fashion) the same hemisphere always towards their centre\r\nof motion. This amounts to saying that even if they started with\r\nretrograde rotation, it was, by solar tidal friction, quickly rendered\r\ndirect.[1187] For it is scarcely necessary to point out that a planet\r\nturning an invariable face to the sun rotates in the same direction in\r\nwhich it revolves, and in the same period. As, with the progress of\r\ncondensation, tides became feebler and rotation more rapid, the\r\naccelerated spinning necessarily proceeded in the sense thus prescribed\r\nfor it. Hence the backward axial movements of Uranus and Neptune may\r\nvery well be a survival, due to the inefficiency of solar tides at their\r\ngreat distance, of a state of things originally prevailing universally\r\nthroughout the system.\r\n\r\nThe general outcome of Mr. Darwin's researches has been to leave\r\nLaplace's cosmogony untouched. He concludes nothing against it, and,\r\nwhat perhaps tells with more weight in the long run, has nothing to\r\nsubstitute for it. In one form or the other, if we speculate at all on\r\nthe development of the planetary system, our speculations are driven\r\ninto conformity with the broad lines of the Nebular Hypothesis--to the\r\nextent, at least, of admitting an original material unity and motive\r\nuniformity. But we can see now, better than formerly, that these supply\r\na bare and imperfect sketch of the truth. We should err gravely were we\r\nto suppose it possible to reconstruct, with the help of any knowledge\r\nour race is ever likely to possess, the real and complete history of our\r\nadmirable system. \"The subtlety of nature,\" Bacon says, \"transcends in\r\nmany ways the subtlety of the intellect and senses of man.\" By no mere\r\nbarren formula of evolution, indiscriminately applied all round, the\r\nresults we marvel at, and by a fragment of which our life is\r\nconditioned, were brought forth; but by the manifold play of interacting\r\nforces, variously modified and variously prevailing, according to the\r\nlocal requirements of the design they were appointed to execute.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1150: _Exposition du Système du Monde_, t. ii., p. 295.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1151: In later editions a retrospective clause was added\r\nadmitting a prior condition of all but evanescent nebulosity.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1152: _Méc.

It proved to be a comet approaching the sun.\r\nBut it changed little in apparent place or brightness for some weeks.\r\nThe gradual development of a central condensation of light was the first\r\nsymptom of coming splendour. At Harvard, in the middle of July, a strong\r\nstellar nucleus was seen; on August 14 a tail began to be thrown out. As\r\nthe comet wanted still over six weeks of the time of its\r\nperihelion-passage, it was obvious that great things might be expected\r\nof it. They did not fail of realisation.\r\n\r\nNot before the early days of September was it generally recognised with\r\nthe naked eye, though it had been detected without a glass at Pulkowa,\r\nAugust 19. But its growth was thenceforward surprisingly rapid, as it\r\nswept with accelerated motion under the hindmost foot of the Great Bear,\r\nand past the starry locks of Berenice. A sudden leap upward in lustre\r\nwas noticed on September 12, when the nucleus shone with about the\r\nbrightness of the pole-star, and the tail, notwithstanding large\r\nforeshortening, could be traced with the lowest telescopic power over\r\nsix degrees of the sphere. The appendage, however, attained its full\r\ndevelopment only after perihelion, September 30, by which time, too, it\r\nlay nearly square to the line of sight from the earth. On October 10 it\r\nstretched in a magnificent scimitar-like curve over a third and upwards\r\nof the visible hemisphere, representing a real extension in space of\r\nfifty-four million miles. But the most striking view was presented on\r\nOctober 5, when the brilliant star Arcturus became involved in the\r\nbrightest part of the tail, and during many hours contributed, its\r\nlustre undiminished by the interposed nebulous screen, to heighten the\r\ngrandeur of the most majestic celestial object of which living memories\r\nretain the impress. Donati's comet was, according to Admiral Smyth's\r\ntestimony,[1188] outdone \"as a mere _sight_-object\" by the great comet\r\nof 1811; but what it lacked in splendour, it surely made up in grace,\r\nand variety of what we may call \"scenic\" effects.\r\n\r\nSome of these were no less interesting to the student than impressive to\r\nthe spectator. At Pulkowa, on the 16th September, Winnecke,[1189] the\r\nfirst director of the Strasburg Observatory, observed a faint outer\r\nenvelope resembling a veil of almost evanescent texture flung somewhat\r\nwidely over the head. Next evening, the first of the \"secondary\" tails\r\nappeared, possibly as part of the same phenomenon. This was a narrow\r\nstraight ray, forming a tangent to the strong curve of the primary tail,\r\nand reaching to a still greater distance from the nucleus. It continued\r\nfaintly visible for about three weeks, during part of which time it was\r\nseen in duplicate. For from the chief train itself, at a point where its\r\ncurvature abruptly changed, issued, as if through the rejection of some\r\nof its materials, a second beam nearly parallel to the first, the rigid\r\nline of which contrasted singularly with the softly diffused and waving\r\naspect of the plume of light from which it sprang. Olbers's theory of\r\nunequal repulsive forces was never more beautifully illustrated. The\r\ntriple tail seemed a visible solar analysis of cometary matter.\r\n\r\nThe processes of luminous emanation going on in this body forcibly\r\nrecalled the observations made on the comets of 1744 and 1835. From the\r\nmiddle of September, the nucleus, estimated by Bond to be under five\r\nhundred miles in diameter, was the centre of action of the most\r\nenergetic kind. Seven distinct \"envelopes\" were detached in succession\r\nfrom the nebulosity surrounding the head, and after rising towards the\r\nsun during periods of from four to seven days, finally cast their\r\nmaterial backward to form the right and left branches of the great\r\ntrain. The separation of these by an obscure axis--apparently as black,\r\nquite close up to the nucleus, as the sky--indicated for the tail a\r\nhollow, cone-like structure;[1190] while the repetition of certain spots\r\nand rays in the same corresponding situation on one envelope after\r\nanother served to show that the nucleus--to some local peculiarity of\r\nwhich they were doubtless due--had no proper rotation, but merely\r\nshifted sufficiently on an axis to preserve the same aspect towards the\r\nsun as it moved round it.[1191] This observation of Bond's was strongly\r\nconfirmatory of Bessel's hypothesis of opposite polarities in such\r\nbodies' opposite sides.\r\n\r\nThe protrusion towards the sun, on September 25, of a brilliant luminous\r\nfan-shaped sector completed the resemblance to Halley's comet. The\r\nappearance of the head was now somewhat that of a \"bat's-wing\" gaslight.\r\nThere were, however, no oscillations to and fro, such as Bessel had seen\r\nand speculated upon in 1835. As the size of the nucleus contracted with\r\napproach to perihelion, its intensity augmented. On October 2, it\r\noutshone Arcturus, and for a week or ten days was a conspicuous object\r\nhalf an hour after sunset. Its lustre--setting aside the light derived\r\nfrom the tail--was, at that date, 6,300 times what it had been on June\r\n15, though _theoretically_--taking into account, that is, only the\r\ndifferences of distance from sun and earth--it should have been only\r\n1/33 of that amount. Here, it might be thought, was convincing evidence\r\nof the comet itself becoming ignited under the growing intensity of the\r\nsolar radiations. Yet experiments with the polariscope were interpreted\r\nin an adverse sense, and Bond's conclusion that the comet sent us\r\nvirtually unmixed reflected sunshine was generally acquiesced in. It\r\nwas, nevertheless, negatived by the first application of the\r\nspectroscope to these bodies.\r\n\r\nVery few comets have been so well or so long observed as Donati's. It\r\nwas visible to the naked eye during 112 days; it was telescopically\r\ndiscernible for 275, the last observation having been made by Mr.\r\nWilliam Mann at the Cape of Good Hope, March 4, 1859. Its course through\r\nthe heavens combined singularly with the orbital place of the earth to\r\nfavour curious inspection. The tail, when near its greatest development,\r\nlost next to nothing by the effects of perspective, and at the same time\r\nlay in a plane sufficiently inclined to the line of sight to enable it\r\nto display its exquisite curves to the greatest advantage. Even the\r\nweather was, on both sides of the Atlantic, propitious during the period\r\nof greatest interest, and the moon as little troublesome as possible.\r\nThe volume compiled by the younger Bond is a monument to the care and\r\nskill with which these advantages were turned to account. Yet this\r\nstately apparition marked no turning-point in the history of cometary\r\nscience. By its study knowledge was indeed materially advanced, but\r\nalong the old lines. No quick and vivid illumination broke upon its\r\npath. Quite insignificant objects--as we have already partly seen--have\r\noften proved more vitally instructive.\r\n\r\nDonati's comet has been identified with no other. Its path is an\r\nimmensely elongated ellipse, lying in a plane far apart from that of the\r\nplanetary movements, carrying it at perihelion considerably within the\r\norbit of Venus, and at aphelion out into space to 5-1/2 times the\r\ndistance from the sun of Neptune. The entire circuit occupies over 2,000\r\nyears, and is performed in a retrograde direction, or against the order\r\nof the Signs. Before its next return, about the year 4000 A.D., the\r\nenigma of its presence and its purpose may have been to some\r\nextent--though we may be sure not completely--penetrated.\r\n\r\nOn June 30, 1861, the earth passed, for the second time in the century,\r\nthrough the tail of a great comet. Some of our readers may remember the\r\nunexpected disclosure, on the withdrawal of the sun below the horizon on\r\nthat evening, of an object so remarkable as to challenge universal\r\nattention. A golden-yellow planetary disc, wrapt in dense nebulosity,\r\nshone out while the June twilight of these latitudes was still in its\r\nfirst strength. The number and complexity of the envelopes surrounding\r\nthe head produced, according to the late Mr. Webb,[1192] a magnificent\r\neffect. Portions of six distinct emanations were traceable. \"It was as\r\nthough a number of light, hazy clouds were floating round a miniature\r\nfull moon.\" As the sky darkened the tail emerged to view.[1193] Although\r\nin brightness and sharpness of definition it could not compete with the\r\ndisplay of 1858, its dimensions proved to be extraordinary. It reached\r\nupwards beyond the zenith when the head had already set. By some\r\nauthorities its extreme length was stated at 118°, and it showed no\r\ntrace of curvature. Most remarkable, however, was the appearance of two\r\nwidely divergent rays, each pointing towards the head, though cut off\r\nfrom it by sky-illumination, of which one was seen by Mr. Webb, and both\r\nby Mr. Williams at Liverpool, a quarter of an hour before midnight.\r\nThere seems no doubt that Webb's interpretation was the true one, and\r\nthat these beams were, in fact, \"the perspective representation of a\r\nconical or cylindrical tail, hanging closely above our heads, and\r\nprobably just being lifted up out of our atmosphere.\"[1194] The cometary\r\ntrain was then rapidly receding from the earth, so that the sides of the\r\n\"outspread fan\" of light shown by it when we were right in the line of\r\nits axis must have appeared (as they did) to close up in departure. The\r\nswiftness with which the visually opened fan shut proved its vicinity;\r\nand, indeed, Mr. Hind's calculations showed that we were not so much\r\nnear as actually within its folds at that very time.\r\n\r\nAlready M. Liais, from his observations at Rio de Janeiro, June 11 to\r\n14, and Mr. Tebbutt, by whom the comet was discovered in New South Wales\r\non May 13, had anticipated such an encounter, while the former\r\nsubsequently proved that it must have occurred in such a way as to cause\r\nan immersion of the earth in cometary matter to a depth of 300,000\r\nmiles.[1195] The comet then lay between the earth and the sun at a\r\ndistance of about fourteen million miles from the former; its tail\r\nstretched outward just along the line of intersection of its own with\r\nthe terrestrial orbit to an extent of fifteen million miles; so that our\r\nglobe, happening to pass at the time, found itself during some hours\r\ninvolved in the flimsy appendage.\r\n\r\nNo perceptible effects were produced by the meeting; it was known to\r\nhave occurred by theory alone. A peculiar glare in the sky, thought by\r\nsome to have distinguished the evening of June 30, was, at best,\r\ninconspicuous. Nor were there any symptoms of unusual electric\r\nexcitement. The Greenwich instruments were, indeed, disturbed on the\r\nfollowing night, but it would be rash to infer that the comet had art or\r\npart in their agitation.\r\n\r\nThe perihelion-passage of this body occurred June 11, 1861; and its\r\norbit has been shown by M. Kreutz of Bonn, from a very complete\r\ninvestigation founded on observations extending over nearly a year, to\r\nbe an ellipse traversed in a period of 409 years.[1196]\r\n\r\nTowards the end of August, 1862, a comet became visible to the naked eye\r\nhigh up in the northern hemisphere, with a nucleus equalling in\r\nbrightness the lesser stars of the Plough and a feeble tail 20° in\r\nlength. It thus occupied quite a secondary position among the members of\r\nits class. It was, nevertheless, a splendid object in comparison with a\r\ntelescopic nebulosity discovered by Tempel at Marseilles, December 19,\r\n1865. This, the sole comet of 1866, slipped past perihelion, January 11,\r\nwithout pomp of train or other appendages, and might have seemed hardly\r\nworth the trouble of pursuing. Fortunately, this was not the view\r\nentertained by observers and computers; since upon the knowledge\r\nacquired of the movements of these two bodies has been founded one of\r\nthe most significant discoveries of modern times. The first of them is\r\nnow styled the comet (1862 iii.) of the August meteors, the second (1866\r\ni.) that of the November meteors. The steps by which this curious\r\nconnection came to be ascertained were many, and were taken in\r\nsuccession by a number of individuals. But the final result was reached\r\nby Schiaparelli of Milan, and remains deservedly associated with his\r\nname.\r\n\r\nThe idea prevalent in the eighteenth century as to the nature of\r\nshooting stars was that they were mere aerial _ignes fatui_--inflammable\r\nvapours accidentally kindled in our atmosphere. But Halley had already\r\nentertained the opinion of their cosmical origin; and Chladni in 1794\r\nformally broached the theory that space is filled with minute\r\ncirculating atoms, which, drawn by the earth's attraction, and ignited\r\nby friction in its gaseous envelope, produce the luminous effects so\r\nfrequently witnessed.[1197] Acting on his suggestion, Brandes and\r\nBenzenberg, two students at the University of Göttingen, began in 1798\r\nto determine the heights of falling stars by simultaneous observations\r\nat a distance. They soon found that they move with planetary velocities\r\nin the most elevated regions of our atmosphere, and by the ascertainment\r\nof this fact laid a foundation of distinct knowledge regarding them.\r\nSome of the data collected, however, served only to perplex opinion, and\r\neven caused Chladni temporarily to renounce his. Many high authorities,\r\nheaded by Laplace in 1802, declared for the lunar-volcanic origin of\r\nmeteorites; but thought on the subject was turbid, and inquiry seemed\r\nonly to stir up the mud of ignorance. It needed one of those amazing\r\nspectacles, at which man assists, no longer in abject terror for his own\r\nfrail fortunes, but with keen curiosity and the vivid expectation of new\r\nknowledge, to bring about a clarification.\r\n\r\nOn the night of November 12-13, 1833, a tempest of falling stars broke\r\nover the earth. North America bore the brunt of its pelting. From the\r\nGulf of Mexico to Halifax, until daylight with some difficulty put an\r\nend to the display, the sky was scored in every direction with shining\r\ntracks and illuminated with majestic fireballs. At Boston the frequency\r\nof meteors was estimated to be about half that of flakes of snow in an\r\naverage snowstorm. Their numbers, while the first fury of their coming\r\nlasted, were quite beyond counting; but as it waned, a reckoning was\r\nattempted, from which it was computed, on the basis of that much\r\ndiminished rate, that 240,000 must have been visible during the nine\r\nhours they continued to fall.[1198]\r\n\r\nNow there was one very remarkable feature common to the innumerable\r\nsmall bodies which traversed, or were consumed in our atmosphere that\r\nnight. _They all seemed to come from the same part of the sky._ Traced\r\nbackward, their paths were invariably found to converge to a point in\r\nthe constellation Leo. Moreover, that point travelled with the stars in\r\ntheir nightly round. In other words, it was entirely independent of the\r\nearth and its rotation. It was a point in inter-planetary space.\r\n\r\nThe _effective_ perception of this fact[1199] amounted to a discovery,\r\nas Olmsted and Twining, who had \"simultaneous ideas\" on the subject,\r\nwere the first to realize. Denison Olmsted was then Professor of\r\nMathematics in Yale College. He showed early in 1834[1200] that the\r\nemanation of the showering meteors from a fixed \"radiant\" proved their\r\napproach to the earth along nearly parallel lines, appearing to diverge\r\nby an effect of perspective; and that those parallel lines must be\r\nsections of orbits described by them round the sun and intersecting that\r\nof the earth. For the November phenomenon was now seen to be a\r\nperiodical one. On the same night of the year 1832, although with less\r\ndazzling and universal splendour than in America in 1833, it had been\r\nwitnessed over great part of Europe and in Arabia. Olmsted accordingly\r\nassigned to the cloud of cosmical particles (or \"comet,\" as he chose to\r\ncall it), by terrestrial encounters with which he supposed the\r\nappearances in question to be produced, a period of about 182 days; its\r\npath a narrow ellipse, meeting, near its farthest end from the sun, the\r\nplace occupied by the earth on November 12.\r\n\r\nOnce for all, then, as the result of the star-fall of 1833, the study of\r\nluminous meteors became an integral part of astronomy. Their membership\r\nof the solar system was no longer a theory or a conjecture--it was an\r\nestablished fact. The discovery might be compared to, if it did not\r\ntranscend in importance, that of the asteroidal group. \"C'est un nouveau\r\nmonde planétaire,\" Arago wrote,[1201] \"qui commence à se révéler à\r\nnous.\"\r\n\r\nEvidences of periodicity continued to accumulate. It was remembered that\r\nHumboldt and Bonpland had been the spectators at Cumana, after midnight\r\non November 12, 1799, of a fiery shower little inferior to that of 1833,\r\nand reported to have been visible from the equator to Greenland.\r\nMoreover, in 1834 and some subsequent years, there were waning\r\nrepetitions of the display, as if through the gradual thinning-out of\r\nthe meteoric supply. The extreme irregularity of its distribution was\r\nnoted by Olbers in 1837, who conjectured that we might have to wait\r\nuntil 1867 to see the phenomenon renewed on its former scale of\r\nmagnificence.[1202] This was the first hint of a thirty-three or\r\nthirty-four year period.\r\n\r\nThe falling stars of November did not alone attract the attention of the\r\nlearned. Similar appearances were traditionally associated with August\r\n10 by the popular phrase in which they figured as \"the tears of St.\r\nLawrence.\" But the association could not be taken on trust from mediæval\r\nauthority. It had to be proved scientifically, and this Quetelet of\r\nBrussels succeeded in doing in December, 1836.[1203]\r\n\r\nA second meteoric revolving system was thus shown to exist. But its\r\nestablishment was at once perceived to be fatal to the \"cosmical cloud\"\r\nhypothesis of Olmsted. For if it be a violation of probability to\r\nattribute to one such agglomeration a period of an exact year, or\r\nsub-multiple of a year, it would be plainly absurd to suppose the\r\nmovements of _two_ or more regulated by such highly artificial\r\nconditions. An alternative was proposed by Adolf Erman of Berlin in\r\n1839.[1204] No longer in _clouds_, but in closed _rings_, he supposed\r\nmeteoric matter to revolve round the sun. Thus the mere circumstance of\r\nintersection by a meteoric of the terrestrial orbit, without any\r\ncoincidence of period, would account for the earth meeting some members\r\nof the system at each annual passage through the \"node\" or point of\r\nintersection. This was an important step in advance, yet it decided\r\nnothing as to the forms of the orbits of such annular assemblages; nor\r\nwas it followed up in any direction for a quarter of a century.\r\n\r\nHubert A. Newton took up, in 1864,[1205] the dropped thread of inquiry.\r\nThe son of a mathematical mother, he attained, at the age of\r\ntwenty-five, to the dignity of Professor of Mathematics in Yale\r\nUniversity, and occupied the post until his death in 1896. The diversion\r\nof his powers, however, from purely abstract studies stimulated their\r\neffective exercise, and constituted him one of the founders of meteoric\r\nastronomy.\r\n\r\nA search through old records carried the November phenomenon back to the\r\nyear 902 A.D., long distinguished as \"the year of the stars.\" For in the\r\nsame night in which Taormina was captured by the Saracens, and the cruel\r\nAghlabite tyrant Ibrahim ibn Ahmed died \"by the judgment of God\" before\r\nCosenza, stars fell from heaven in such abundance as to amaze and\r\nterrify beholders far and near. This was on October 13, and recurrences\r\nwere traced down through the subsequent centuries, always with a day's\r\ndelay in about seventy years. It was easy, too, to derive from the dates\r\na cycle of 33-1/4 years, so that Professor Newton did not hesitate to\r\npredict the exhibition of an unusually striking meteoric spectacle on\r\nNovember 13-14, 1866.[1206]\r\n\r\nFor the astronomical explanation of the phenomena, recourse was had to a\r\nmethod introduced by Erman of computing meteoric orbits. It was found,\r\nhowever, that conspicuous recurrences every thirty-three or thirty-four\r\nyears could be explained on the supposition of five widely different\r\nperiods, combined with varying degrees of extension in the revolving\r\ngroup. Professor Newton himself gave the preference to the shortest--of\r\n354-1/2 days, but indicated the means of deciding with certainty upon\r\nthe true one. It was furnished by the advancing motion of the node, or\r\nthat day's delay of the November shower every seventy years, which the\r\nold chronicles had supplied data for detecting. For this is a strictly\r\nmeasurable effect of gravitational disturbance by the various planets,\r\nthe amount of which naturally depends upon the course pursued by the\r\ndisturbed bodies. Here the great mathematical resources of Professor\r\nAdams were brought to bear. By laborious processes of calculation, he\r\nascertained that four out of Newton's five possible periods were\r\nentirely incompatible with the observed nodal displacement, while for\r\nthe fifth--that of 33-1/4 years--a perfectly harmonious result was\r\nobtained.[1207] This was the last link in the chain of evidence proving\r\nthat the November meteors--or \"Leonids,\" as they had by that time come\r\nto be called--revolve round the sun in a period of 33·27 years, in an\r\nellipse spanning the vast gulf between the orbits of the earth and\r\nUranus, the group being so extended as to occupy nearly three years in\r\ndefiling past the scene of terrestrial encounters. But before it was\r\ncompleted in March, 1867, the subject had assumed a new aspect and\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nProfessor Newton's prediction of a remarkable star-shower in November,\r\n1866, was punctually fulfilled. This time, Europe served as the main\r\ntarget of the celestial projectiles, and observers were numerous and\r\nforewarned. The display, although, according to Mr. Baxendell's\r\nmemory,[1208] inferior to that of 1833, was of extraordinary\r\nimpressiveness. Dense crowds of meteors, equal in lustre to the\r\nbrightest stars, and some rivalling Venus at her best,[1209] darted from\r\neast to west across the sky with enormous apparent velocities, and with\r\na certain determinateness of aim, as if let fly with a purpose, and at\r\nsome definite object.[1210] Nearly all left behind them trains of\r\nemerald green or clear blue light, which occasionally lasted many\r\nminutes, before they shrivelled and curled up out of sight. The maximum\r\nrush occurred a little after one o'clock on the morning of November 14,\r\nwhen attempts to count were overpowered by frequency. But during a\r\nprevious interval of seven minutes five seconds, four observers at Mr.\r\nBishop's observatory at Twickenham reckoned 514, and during an hour\r\n1,120.[1211] Before daylight the earth had fairly cut her way through\r\nthe star-bearing stratum; the \"ethereal rockets\" had ceased to fly.\r\n\r\nThis event brought the subject of shooting stars once more vividly to\r\nthe notice of astronomers. Schiaparelli had, indeed, been already\r\nattracted by it. The results of his studies were made known in four\r\nremarkable letters, addressed, before the close of the year 1866, to\r\nFather Secchi, and published in the _Bulletino_ of the Roman\r\nObservatory.[1212] Their upshot was to show, in the first place, that\r\nmeteors possess a real velocity considerably greater than that of the\r\nearth, and travel, accordingly, to enormously greater distances from the\r\nsun along tracks resembling those of comets in being very eccentric, in\r\nlying at all levels indifferently, and in being pursued in either\r\ndirection. It was next inferred that comets and meteors equally have an\r\norigin foreign to the solar system, but are drawn into it temporarily by\r\nthe sun's attraction, and occasionally fixed in it by the backward pull\r\nof some planet. But the crowning fact was reserved for the last. It was\r\nthe astonishing one that the August meteors move in the same orbit with\r\nthe bright comet of 1862--that the comet, in fact, is but a larger\r\nmember of the family named \"Perseids\" because their radiant point is\r\nsituated in the constellation Perseus.\r\n\r\nThis discovery was quickly capped by others of the same kind. Leverrier\r\npublished, January 21, 1867,[1213] elements for the November swarm,\r\nfounded on the most recent and authentic observations; at once\r\nidentified by Dr. C. F. W. Peters of Altona with Oppolzer's elements for\r\nTempel's comet of 1866.[1214] A few days later, Schiaparelli, having\r\nrecalculated the orbit of the meteors from improved data, arrived at the\r\nsame conclusion; while Professor Weiss of Vienna pointed to the\r\nagreement between the orbits of a comet which had appeared in 1861 and\r\nof a star-shower found to recur on April 20 (Lyraïds), as well as\r\nbetween those of Biela's comet and certain conspicuous meteors of\r\nNovember 28.[1215]\r\n\r\nThese instances do not seem to be exceptional. The number of known or\r\nsuspected accordances of cometary tracks with meteor streams contained\r\nin a list drawn up in 1878[1216] by Professor Alexander S. Herschel (who\r\nhas made the subject peculiarly his own) amounts to seventy-six;\r\nalthough the four first detected still remain the most conspicuous, and\r\nperhaps the only absolutely sure examples of a relation as significant\r\nas it was, to most astronomers, unexpected.\r\n\r\nThere had, indeed, been anticipatory ideas. Not that Kepler's comparison\r\nof shooting stars to \"minute comets,\" or Maskelyne's \"forse risulterà\r\nche essi sono comete,\" in a letter to the Abate Cesaris, December 12,\r\n1774,[1217] need count for much. But Chladni, in 1819,[1218] considered\r\nboth to be fragments or particles of the same primitive matter,\r\nirregularly scattered through space as nebulæ; and Morstadt of Prague\r\nsuggested about 1837[1219] that the meteors of November might be\r\ndispersed atoms from the tail of Biela's comet, the path of which is cut\r\nacross by the earth near that epoch. Professor Kirkwood, however, by a\r\nluminous intuition, penetrated the whole secret, so far as it has yet\r\nbeen made known. In an article published, or rather buried, in the\r\n_Danville Quarterly Review_ for December, 1861, he argued, from the\r\nobserved division of Biela, and other less noted instances of the same\r\nkind, that the sun exercises a \"divellent influence\" on the nuclei of\r\ncomets, which may be presumed to continue its action until their\r\ncorporate existence (so to speak) ends in complete pulverisation. \"May\r\nnot,\" he continued, \"our periodic meteors be the débris of ancient but\r\nnow disintegrated comets, whose matter has become distributed round\r\ntheir orbits?\"[1220]\r\n\r\nThe gist of Schiaparelli's discovery could not be more clearly conveyed.\r\nFor it must be borne in mind that with the ultimate destiny of comets'\r\ntails this had nothing to do. The tenuous matter composing them is, no\r\ndoubt, permanently lost to the body from which it emanated; but science\r\ndoes not pretend to track its further wanderings through space. It can,\r\nhowever, state categorically that these will no longer be conducted\r\nalong the paths forsaken under solar compulsion. From the central, and\r\nprobably solid parts of comets, on the other hand, are derived the\r\ngranules by the swift passage of which our skies are seamed with\r\nperiodic fires. It is certain that a loosely agglomerated mass (such as\r\ncometary nuclei most likely are) must gradually separate through the\r\nunequal action of gravity on its various parts--through, in short, solar\r\ntidal influence. Thenceforward its fragments will revolve independently\r\nin parallel orbits, at first as a swarm, finally--when time has been\r\ngiven for the full effects of the lagging of the slower moving particles\r\nto develop--as a closed ring. The first condition is still, more or\r\nless, that of the November meteors; those of August have already arrived\r\nat the second. For this reason, Leverrier pronounced, in 1867, the\r\nPerseid to be of older formation than the Leonid system. He even\r\nassigned a date at which the introduction of the last-named bodies into\r\ntheir present orbit was probably effected through the influence of\r\nUranus. In 126 A.D. a close approach must have taken place between the\r\nplanet and the parent comet of the November stars, after which its\r\nregular returns to perihelion, and the consequent process of its\r\ndisintegration, set in. Though not complete, it is already far advanced.\r\n\r\nThe view that meteorites are the dust of decaying comets was now to be\r\nput to a definite test of prediction. Biela's comet had not been seen\r\nsince its duplicate return in 1852. Yet it had been carefully watched\r\nfor with the best telescopes; its path was accurately known; every\r\nperturbation it could suffer was scrupulously taken into account. Under\r\nthese circumstances, its repeated failure to come up to time might\r\nfairly be thought to imply a cessation from visible existence. Might it\r\nnot, however, be possible that it would appear under another form--that\r\na star-shower might have sprung from and would commemorate its\r\ndissolution?\r\n\r\nAn unusually large number of falling stars were seen by Brandes,\r\nDecember 6, 1798. Similar displays were noticed in the years 1830, 1838,\r\nand 1847, and the point from which they emanated was shown by Heis at\r\nAix-la-Chapelle to be situated near the bright star Gamma\r\nAndromedæ.[1221] Now this is precisely the direction in which the orbit\r\nof Biela's comet would seem to lie, as it runs down to cut the\r\nterrestrial track very near the place of the earth at the above dates.\r\nThe inference was, then, an easy one, that the meteors were pursuing the\r\nsame path with the comet; and it was separately arrived at, early in\r\n1867, by Weiss, D'Arrest, and Galle.[1222] But Biela travels in the\r\nopposite direction to Tempel's comet and its attendant \"Leonids\"; its\r\nmotion is direct, or from west to east, while theirs is retrograde.\r\nConsequently, the motion of its node is in the opposite direction too.\r\nIn other words, the meeting-place of its orbit with that of the earth\r\nretreats (and very rapidly) along the ecliptic instead of advancing. So\r\nthat if the \"Andromedes\" stood in the supposed intimate relation to\r\nBiela's comet, they might be expected to anticipate the times of their\r\nrecurrence by as much as a week in half a century. All doubt as to the\r\nfact may be said to have been removed by Signor Zezioli's observation of\r\nthe annual shower in more than usual abundance at Bergamo, November 30,\r\n1867.\r\n\r\nThe missing comet was next due at perihelion in the year 1872, and the\r\nprobability was contemplated by both Weiss and Galle of its being\r\nreplaced by a copious discharge of falling stars. The precise date of\r\nthe occurrence was not easily determinable, but Galle thought the\r\nchances in favour of November 28. The event anticipated the prediction\r\nby twenty-four hours. Scarcely had the sun set in Western Europe on\r\nNovember 27, when it became evident that Biela's comet was shedding over\r\nus the pulverised products of its disintegration. The meteors came in\r\nvolleys from the foot of the Chained Lady, their numbers at times\r\nbaffling the attempt to keep a reckoning. At Moncalieri, about 8 p.m.,\r\nthey constituted (as Father Denza said[1223]) a \"real rain of fire.\"\r\nFour observers counted, on an average, four hundred each minute and a\r\nhalf; and not a few fireballs, equalling the moon in diameter, traversed\r\nthe sky. On the whole, however, the stars of 1872, though about equally\r\nnumerous, were less brilliant than those of 1866; the phosphorescent\r\ntracks marking their passage were comparatively evanescent and their\r\nmovements sluggish. This is easily understood when we remember that the\r\nAndromedes _overtake_ the earth, while the Leonids rush to meet it; the\r\nvelocity of encounter for the first class of bodies being under twelve,\r\nfor the second above forty-four miles a second. The spectacle was,\r\nnevertheless, magnificent. It presented itself successively to various\r\nparts of the earth, from Bombay and the Mauritius to New Brunswick and\r\nVenezuela, and was most diligently and extensively observed. Here it had\r\nwell-nigh terminated by midnight.[1224]\r\n\r\nIt was attended by a slight aurora, and although Tacchini had\r\ntelegraphed that the state of the sun rendered some show of polar lights\r\nprobable, it has too often figured as an accompaniment of star-showers\r\nto permit the coincidence to rank as fortuitous. Admiral Wrangel was\r\naccustomed to describe how, during the prevalence of an aurora on the\r\nSiberian coast, the passage of a meteor never failed to extend the\r\nluminosity to parts of the sky previously dark;[1225] and an enhancement\r\nof electrical disturbance may well be associated with the flittings of\r\nsuch cosmical atoms.\r\n\r\nA singular incident connected with the meteors of 1872 has now to be\r\nrecounted. The late Professor Klinkerfues, who had observed them very\r\ncompletely at Göttingen, was led to believe that not merely the débris\r\nstrewn along its path, but the comet itself must have been in immediate\r\nproximity to the earth during their appearance.[1226] If so, it might be\r\npossible, he thought, to descry it as it retreated in the diametrically\r\nopposite direction from that in which it had approached. On November 30,\r\naccordingly, he telegraphed to Mr. Pogson, the Madras astronomer, \"Biela\r\ntouched earth November 27; search near Theta Centauri\"--the\r\n\"anti-radiant,\" as it is called, being situated close to that star. Bad\r\nweather prohibited observation during thirty-six hours, but when the\r\nrain clouds broke on the morning of December 2, there a comet was, just\r\nin the indicated position. In appearance it might have passed well\r\nenough for one of the Biela twins. It had no tail, but a decided\r\nnucleus, and was about 45 seconds across, being thus altogether below\r\nthe range of naked-eye discernment. It was again observed December 3,\r\nwhen a short tail was perceptible; but overcast skies supervened, and it\r\nhas never since been seen. Its identity accordingly remains in doubt. It\r\nseems tolerably certain, however, that it was _not_ the lost comet,\r\nwhich ought to have passed that spot twelve weeks earlier, and was\r\nsubject to no conceivable disturbance capable of delaying to that extent\r\nits revolution. On the other hand, there is the strongest likelihood\r\nthat it belonged to the same system[1227]--that it was a third fragment,\r\ntorn from the parent-body of the Andromedes at a period anterior to our\r\nfirst observations of it.\r\n\r\nIn thirteen years Biela's comet (or its relics) travels nearly twice\r\nround its orbit, so that a renewal of the meteoric shower of 1872 was\r\nlooked for on the same day of the year 1885, the probability being\r\nemphasised by an admonitory circular from Dunecht. Astronomers were\r\naccordingly on the alert, and were not disappointed. In England,\r\nobservation was partially impeded by clouds; but at Malta, Palermo,\r\nBeyrout, and other southern stations, the scene was most striking. The\r\nmeteors were both larger and more numerous than in 1872. Their numbers\r\nin the densest part of the drift were estimated by Professor Newton at\r\n75,000 per hour, visible from one spot to so large a group of spectators\r\nthat practically none could be missed. Yet each of these multitudinous\r\nlittle bodies was found by him to travel in a clear cubical space of\r\nwhich the edge measured twenty miles![1228] Thus the dazzling effect of\r\na luminous throng was produced without jostling or overcrowding, by\r\nparticles, it might almost be said, isolated in the void.\r\n\r\nTheir aspect was strongly characteristic of the Andromede family of\r\nmeteors. \"They invariably,\" Mr. Denning wrote,[1229] \"traversed short\r\npaths with very slow motions, and became extinct in evolved streams of\r\nyellowish sparks.\" The conclusion seemed obvious \"that these meteors are\r\nformed of very soft materials, which expand while incalescent, and are\r\nimmediately crumbled and dissipated into exiguous dust.\"\r\n\r\nThe Biela meteors of 1885 did not merely gratify astronomers with a\r\nfulfilled prediction, but were the means of communicating to them some\r\nvaluable information. Although their main body was cut through by the\r\nmoving earth in six hours, and was not more than 100,000 miles across,\r\nskirmishers were thrown out to nearly a million miles on either side of\r\nthe compact central battalions. Members of the system were, on the 26th\r\nof November, recorded by Mr. Denning at the hourly rate of about 130;\r\nand they did not wholly cease to be visible until December 1. They\r\nafforded besides a particularly well-marked example of that diffuseness\r\nof radiation previously observed in some less conspicuous displays.\r\nTheir paths seemed to diverge from an area rather than from a point in\r\nthe sky. They came so ill to focus that divergences of several degrees\r\nwere found between the most authentically determined radiants. These\r\nincongruities are attributed by Professor Newton to the irregular shape\r\nof the meteoroids producing unsymmetrical resistance from the air, and\r\nhence causing them to glance from their original direction on entering\r\nit. Thus, their luminous tracks did not always represent (even apart\r\nfrom the effects of the earth's attraction) the true prolongation of\r\ntheir course through space.\r\n\r\nThe Andromedes of 1872 were laggards behind the comet from which they\r\nsprang; those of 1885 were its avant-couriers. That wasted and disrupted\r\nbody was not due at the node until January 26, 1886, sixty days, that\r\nis, after the earth's encounter with its meteoric fragments. These are\r\nnow probably scattered over more than five hundred million miles of its\r\norbits;[1230] yet Professor Newton considers that all must have formed\r\none compact group with Biela at the time of its close approach to\r\nJupiter about the middle of 1841. For otherwise both comet and\r\nmeteorites could not have experienced, as they seem to have done, the\r\nsame kind and amount of disturbance. The rapidity of cometary\r\ndisintegration is thus curiously illustrated.\r\n\r\nA short-lived persuasion that the missing heavenly body itself had been\r\nrecovered, was created by Mr. Edwin Holms's discovery, at London,\r\nNovember 6, 1892, of a tolerably bright, tailless comet, just in a spot\r\nwhich Biela's comet must have traversed in approaching the intersection\r\nof its orbit with that of the earth. A hasty calculation by Berberich\r\nassigned elements to the newcomer seeming not only to ratify the\r\nidentity, but to promise a quasi-encounter with the earth on November\r\n21. The only effect of the prediction, however, was to raise a panic\r\namong the negroes of the Southern States of America. The comet quietly\r\nignored it, and moved away from instead of towards the appointed\r\nmeeting-place. Its projection, then, on the night of its discovery, upon\r\na point of the Biela-orbit was by a mere caprice of chance. North\r\nAmerica, nevertheless, was visited on November 23 by a genuine Andromede\r\nshower. Although the meteors were less numerous than in 1885, Professor\r\nYoung estimated that 30,000, at the least, of their orange fire-streaks\r\ncame, during five hours, within the range of view at Princeton.[1231]\r\nBrédikhine estimated the width of the space containing them at about\r\n2,700,000 miles.[1232] The anticipation of their due time by four days\r\nimplied--if they were a prolongation of the main Biela group, the\r\nnucleus of which passed the spot of encounter five months previously--a\r\nrecession of the node since 1885 by no less than three degrees. Unless,\r\nindeed, Mr. Denning were right in supposing the display to have\r\nproceeded from \"an associated branch of the main swarm through which we\r\npassed in 1872 and 1885.\"[1233] The existence of separated detachments\r\nof Biela meteors, due to disturbing planetary action, was contemplated\r\nas highly probable by Schiaparelli.[1234] Such may have been the belated\r\nflights met with in 1830, 1838, 1841, and 1847, and such the advance\r\nflight plunged through in 1892. A shower looked for November 23, 1899,\r\ndid not fall, and no further display from this quarter is probable until\r\nNovember 17, 1905, although one is possible a year earlier.[1235]\r\n\r\nThe Leonids, through the adverse influence of Jupiter and Saturn,\r\ninflicted upon multitudes of eager watchers a still more poignant\r\ndisappointment. A dense part of the swarm, having nearly completed a\r\nrevolution since 1866, should, travelling normally, have met the earth\r\nNovember 15, 1899; in point of fact, it swerved sunward, and the\r\nmillions of meteorites which would otherwise have been sacrificed for\r\nthe illumination of our skies escaped a fiery doom. The contingency had\r\nbeen forecast in the able calculations of Dr. Johnstone Stoney and Dr.\r\nA. M. W. Downing,[1236] superintendent of the Nautical Almanac Office;\r\nbut the verification scarcely compensated the failure. Nor was the\r\nsituation retrieved in the following years. Only ragged fringes of the\r\ngreat tempest-cloud here and there touched our globe. As the same\r\ninvestigators warned us to expect, the course of the meteorites had been\r\nnot only rendered sinuous by perturbation, but also broken and\r\nirregular. We can no longer count upon the Leonids. Their glory, for\r\nscenic purposes, is departed. The comet associated with them also evaded\r\nobservation. Although it doubtless kept its tryst with the sun in the\r\nspring of 1899, the attendant circumstances were too unfavourable to\r\nallow it to be seen from the earth.[1237] By an almost fantastic\r\ncoincidence, nevertheless, a faint comet was photographed, November 14,\r\n1898,[1238] by Dr. Chase, of the Yale College Observatory, close to the\r\nLeonid radiant, whither a \"meteorograph\" was directed with a view to\r\nrecording trails left by precursors of the main Leonid body. A promising\r\nstart, too, was made on the same occasion with meteoric researches from\r\nsensitive plates.[1239] Indeed, Schaeberle and Colton[1240] had already,\r\nin 1896, determined the height of a Leonid by means of photographs taken\r\nat stations on different ridges of Mount Hamilton; and Professor\r\nPickering has prosecuted similar work at Harvard, with encouraging\r\nresults. Everything in this branch of science depends upon how far they\r\ncan be carried. Without the meteorograph, rigid accuracy in the\r\nobservation of shooting stars is unattainable, and rigid accuracy is the\r\n_sine quâ non_ for obtaining exact knowledge.\r\n\r\nBiela does not offer the only example of cometary disruption. Setting\r\naside the unauthentic reports of early chroniclers, we meet the \"double\r\ncomet\" discovered by Liais at Olinda (Brazil), February 27, 1860, of\r\nwhich the division appeared recent, and about to be carried\r\nfarther.[1241] But a division once established, separation must\r\ncontinually progress. The periodic times of the fragments will never be\r\nidentical; one must drop a little behind the other at each revolution,\r\nuntil at length they come to travel in remote parts of nearly the same\r\norbit. Thus the comet predicted by Klinkerfues and discovered by Pogson\r\nhad already lagged to the extent of twelve weeks, and we shall meet\r\ninstances farther on where the retardation is counted, not by weeks, but\r\nby years. Here original identity emerges only from calculation and\r\ncomparison of orbits.\r\n\r\nComets, then, die, as Kepler wrote long ago, _sicut bombyces filo\r\nfundendo_. This certainty, anticipated by Kirkwood in 1861, we have at\r\nleast acquired from the discovery of their generative connection with\r\nmeteors. Nay, their actual materials become, in smaller or larger\r\nproportions, incorporated with our globe. It is not, indeed, universally\r\nadmitted that the ponderous masses of which, according to Daubrée's\r\nestimate,[1242] at least 600 fall annually from space upon the earth,\r\never formed part of the bodies known to us as comets. Some follow\r\nTschermak in attributing to aerolites a totally different origin from\r\nthat of periodical shooting-stars. That no clear line of demarcation can\r\nbe drawn is no valid reason for asserting that no real distinction\r\nexists; and it is certainly remarkable that a meteoric fusillade may be\r\nkept up for hours without a single solid projectile reaching its\r\ndestination. It would seem as if the celestial army had been supplied\r\nwith blank cartridges. Yet, since a few detonating meteors have been\r\nfound to proceed from ascertained radiants of shooting-stars, it is\r\ndifficult to suppose that any generic difference separates them.\r\n\r\nTheir assimilation is further urged--though not with any demonstrative\r\nforce--by two instances, the only two on record, of the tangible descent\r\nof an aerolite during the progress of a star-shower. On April 4, 1095,\r\nthe Saxon Chronicle informs us that stars fell \"so thickly that no man\r\ncould count them,\" and adds that one of them having struck the ground in\r\nFrance, a bystander \"cast water upon it, which was raised in steam with\r\na great noise of boiling.\"[1243] And again, on November 27, 1885, while\r\nthe skirts of the Andromede-tempest were trailing over Mexico, \"a ball\r\nof fire\" was precipitated from the sky at Mazapil, within view of a\r\nranchman.[1244] Scientific examination proved it to be a \"siderite,\" or\r\nmass of \"nickel-iron\"; its weight exceeded eight pounds, and it\r\ncontained many nodules of graphite. We are not, however, authorised by\r\nthe circumstances of its arrival to regard the Mazapil fragment of\r\ncosmic metal as a specimen torn from Biela's comet. In this, as in the\r\npreceding case, the coincidence of the fall with the shower may have\r\nbeen purely casual, since no hint is given of any sort of agreement\r\nbetween the tracks followed by the sample provided for curious study,\r\nand the swarming meteors consumed in the upper air.\r\n\r\nProfessor Newton's inquiries into the tracks pursued by meteorites\r\nprevious to their collisions with the earth tend to distinguish them, at\r\nleast specifically, from shooting-stars. He found that nearly all had\r\nbeen travelling with a direct movement in orbits the perihelia of which\r\nlay in the outer half of the space separating the earth from the\r\nsun.[1245] Shooting-stars, on the contrary, are entirely exempt from\r\nsuch limitations. The Yale Professor concluded \"that the larger\r\nmeteorites moving in our solar system are allied much more closely with\r\nthe group of comets of short period than with the comets whose orbits\r\nare nearly parabolic.\" They would thus seem to be more at home than\r\nmight have been expected amid the planetary family. Father Carbonelle\r\nhas, moreover, shown[1246] that meteorites, if explosion-products of the\r\nearth or moon, should, with rare exceptions, follow just the kind of\r\npaths assigned to them, from data of observation, by Professor Newton.\r\nYet it is altogether improbable that projectiles from terrestrial\r\nvolcanoes should, at any geological epoch, have received impulses\r\npowerful enough to enable them, not only to surmount the earth's\r\ngravity, but to penetrate its atmosphere.\r\n\r\nA striking--indeed, an almost startling--peculiarity, on the other\r\nhand, divides from their congeners a class of meteors identified by\r\nMr. Denning during ten years' patient watching of such phenomena at\r\nBristol.[1247] These are described as \"meteors with stationary\r\nradiants,\" since for months together they seem to come from the same\r\nfixed points in the sky. Now this implies quite a portentous velocity.\r\nThe direction of meteor-radiants is affected by a kind of\r\n_aberration_, analogous to the aberration of light. It results from a\r\ncomposition of terrestrial with meteoric motion. Hence, unless that of\r\nthe earth in its orbit be by comparison insignificant, the visual line\r\nof encounter must shift, if not perceptibly from day to day, at any\r\nrate conspicuously from month to month. The fixity, then, of many\r\nsystems observed by Mr. Denning seems to demand the admission that\r\ntheir members travel so fast as to throw the earth's movement\r\ncompletely out of the account. The required velocity would be, by Mr.\r\nRanyard's calculation, at least 880 miles a second.[1248] But the\r\naspect of the meteors justifies no such extravagant assumption. Their\r\nseeming swiftness is very various, and--what is highly significant--it\r\nis notably less when they pursue than when they meet the earth. Yet\r\nthe \"incredible and unaccountable\"[1249] fact of the existence of\r\nthese \"long radiants,\" although doubted by Tisserand[1250] because of\r\nits theoretical refractoriness, must apparently be admitted. The first\r\nplausible explanation of them was offered by Professor Turner in\r\n1899.[1251] They represent, in his view, the cumulative effects of the\r\nearth's attraction. The validity of his reasoning is, however, denied\r\nby M. Brédikhine,[1252] who prefers to regard them as a congeries of\r\nseparate streams. The enigma they present has evidently not yet\r\nreceived its definitive solution.\r\n\r\nThe Perseids afford, on the contrary, a remarkable instance of a\r\n\"shifting radiant.\" Mr. Denning's observations of these yellowish,\r\nleisurely meteors extend over nearly six weeks, from July 8 to August\r\n16; the point of radiation meantime progressing no less than 57° in\r\nright ascension. Doubts as to their common origin were hence freely\r\nexpressed, especially by Mr. Monck of Dublin.[1253] But the late Dr.\r\nKleiber[1254] showed, by strict geometrical reasoning, that the\r\nforty-nine radiants successively determined for the shower were all, in\r\nfact, comprised within one narrowly limited region of space. In other\r\nwords, the application of the proper correction for the terrestrial\r\nmovement, and the effects of attraction by which each individual\r\nshooting-star is compelled to describe a hyperbola round the earth's\r\ncentre, reduces the extended line of radiants to a compact group, with\r\nthe cometary radiant for its central point; the cometary radiant being\r\nthe spot in the sky met by a tangent to the orbit of the Perseid comet\r\nof 1862 at its intersection with the orbit of the earth. The reality of\r\nthe connection between the comet and the meteors could scarcely be more\r\nclearly proved; while the vast dimensions of the stream into which the\r\nlatter are found to be diffused cannot but excite astonishment not\r\nunmixed with perplexity.\r\n\r\nThe first successful application of the spectroscope to comets was by\r\nDonati in 1864.[1255] A comet discovered by Tempel, July 4, brightened\r\nuntil it appeared like a star somewhat below the second magnitude, with\r\na feeble tail 30° in length. It was remarkable as having, on August 7,\r\nalmost totally eclipsed a small star--a very rare occurrence.[1256] On\r\nAugust 5 Donati admitted its light through his train of prisms, and\r\nfound it, thus analysed, to consist of three bright bands--yellow,\r\ngreen, and blue--separated by wider dark intervals. This implied a good\r\ndeal. Comets had previously been considered, as we have seen, to shine\r\nmainly, if not wholly, by reflected sunlight. They were now perceived to\r\nbe self-luminous, and to be formed, to a large extent, of glowing gas.\r\nThe next step was to determine what _kind_ of gas it was that was thus\r\nglowing in them; and this was taken by Sir William Huggins in\r\n1868.[1257]\r\n\r\nA comet of subordinate brilliancy, known as comet 1868 ii., or sometimes\r\nas Winnecke's, was the subject of his experiment. On comparing its\r\nspectrum with that of an olefiant-gas \"vacuum tube\" rendered luminous by\r\nelectricity, he found the agreement exact. It has since been abundantly\r\nconfirmed. All the eighteen comets tested by light analysis, between\r\n1868 and 1880, showed the typical hydro-carbon spectrum[1258] common to\r\nthe whole group of those compounds, but probably due immediately to the\r\npresence of acetylene. Some minor deviations from the laboratory\r\npattern, in the shifting of the maxima of light from the edge towards\r\nthe middle of the yellow and blue bands, have been experimentally\r\nreproduced by Vogel and Hasselberg in tubes containing a mixture of\r\ncarbonic oxide with olefiant gas.[1259] Their illumination by disruptive\r\nelectric discharges was, however, a condition _sine quâ non_ for the\r\nexhibition of the cometary type of spectrum. When a continuous current\r\nwas employed, the carbonic oxide bands asserted themselves to the\r\nexclusion of the hydro-carbons. The distinction has great significance\r\nas regards the nature of comets. Of particular interest in this\r\nconnection is the circumstance that carbonic oxide is one of the gases\r\nevolved by meteoric stones and irons under stress of heat.[1260] For it\r\nmust apparently have formed part of an aeriform mass in which they were\r\nimmersed at an earlier stage of their history.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE II.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Great Comet.\r\n\r\nPhotographed, May 5, 1901, with the thirteen-inch Astrographic Refractor\r\nof the Royal Observatory, Cape of Good Hope.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a few exceptional comets the usual carbon-bands have been missed. Two\r\nsuch were observed by Sir William Huggins in 1866 and 1867\r\nrespectively.[1261] In each a green ray, approximating in position to\r\nthe fundamental nebular line, crossed an otherwise unbroken spectrum.\r\nAnd Holmes's comet of 1892 displayed only a faint prismatic band devoid\r\nof any characteristic feature.[1262] Now these three might well be set\r\ndown as partially effete bodies; but a brilliant comet, visible in\r\nsouthern latitudes in April and May, 1901, so far resembled them in the\r\nquality of its light as to give a spectrum mainly, if not purely,\r\ncontinuous. This, accordingly, is no symptom of decay.\r\n\r\nThe earliest comet of first-class lustre to present itself for\r\nspectroscopic examination was that discovered by Coggia at Marseilles,\r\nApril 17, 1874. Invisible to the naked eye till June, it blazed out in\r\nJuly a splendid ornament of our northern skies, with a just perceptibly\r\ncurved tail, reaching more than half way from the horizon to the zenith,\r\nand a nucleus surpassing in brilliancy the brightest stars in the Swan.\r\nBrédikhine, Vogel, and Huggins[1263] were unanimous in pronouncing its\r\nspectrum to be that of marsh or olefiant gas. Father Secchi, in the\r\nclear sky of Rome, was able to push the identification even closer than\r\nhad heretofore been done. The _complete_ hydro-carbon spectrum consists\r\nof five zones of variously coloured light. Three of these only--the\r\nthree central ones--had till then been obtained from comets; owing, it\r\nwas supposed, to their temperature not being high enough to develop the\r\nothers. The light of Coggia's comet, however, was found to contain all\r\nfive, traces of the violet band emerging June 4, of the red, July\r\n2.[1264] Presumably, all five would show universally in cometary\r\nspectra, were the dispersed rays strong enough to enable them to be\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nThe gaseous surroundings of comets are, then, largely made up of a\r\ncompound of hydrogen with carbon. Other materials are also present; but\r\nthe hydro-carbon element is probably unfailing and predominant. Its\r\nluminosity is, there is little doubt, an effect of electrical\r\nexcitement. Zöllner showed in 1872[1265] that, owing to evaporation and\r\nother changes produced by rapid approach to the sun, electrical\r\nprocesses of considerable intensity must take place in comets; and that\r\ntheir original light is immediately connected with these, and depends\r\nupon solar radiation, rather through its direct or indirect electrifying\r\neffects, than through its more obvious thermal power, may be considered\r\na truth permanently acquired to science.[1266] They are not, it thus\r\nseems, bodies incandescent through heat, but glowing by electricity; and\r\nthis is compatible, under certain circumstances, with a relatively low\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nThe gaseous spectrum of comets is accompanied, in varying degrees, by a\r\ncontinuous spectrum. This is usually derived most strongly from the\r\nnucleus, but extends, more or less, to the nebulous appendages. In part,\r\nit is certainly due to reflected sunlight; in part, most likely, to the\r\nignition of minute solid particles.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1188: _Month.

We have, then, the assurance that\r\nthese extraordinary appendages are composed of no ethereal or\r\nsupersensual stuff, but of matter such as we know it, and subject to the\r\nordinary laws of motion, though in a state of extreme tenuity.\r\n\r\nOlbers, as already stated, originated in 1812 the view that the tails of\r\ncomets are made up of particles subject to a force of electrical\r\nrepulsion proceeding from the sun. It was developed and enforced by\r\nBessel's discussion of the appearances presented by Halley's comet in\r\n1835. He, moreover, provided a formula for computing the movement of a\r\nparticle under the influence of a repulsive force of any given\r\nintensity, and thus laid firmly the foundation of a mathematical theory\r\nof cometary emanations. Professor W. A. Norton, of Yale College,\r\nconsiderably improved this by inquiries begun in 1844, and resumed on\r\nthe apparition of Donati's comet; and Dr. C. F. Pape at Altona[1267]\r\ngave numerical values for the impulses outward from the sun, which must\r\nhave actuated the materials respectively of the curved and straight\r\ntails adorning the same beautiful and surprising object.\r\n\r\nThe _physical_ theory of repulsion, however, was, it might be said,\r\nstill in the air. Nor did it even begin to assume consistency until\r\nZöllner took it in hand in 1871.[1268] It is perfectly well ascertained\r\nthat the energy of the push or pull produced by electricity depends\r\n(other things being the same) upon the _surface_ of the body acted on;\r\nthat of gravity upon its _mass_. The efficacy of solar electrical\r\nrepulsion relatively to solar gravitational attraction grows,\r\nconsequently, as the size of the particle diminishes. Make this small\r\nenough, and it will virtually cease to gravitate, and will\r\nunconditionally obey the impulse to recession.\r\n\r\nThis principle Zöllner was the first to realise in its application to\r\ncomets. It gives the key to their constitution. Admitting that the sun\r\nand they are similarly electrified, their more substantially aggregated\r\nparts will still follow the solicitations of his gravity, while the\r\nfinely divided particles escaping from them will, simply by reason of\r\ntheir minuteness, fall under the sway of his repellent electric power.\r\nThey will, in other words, form \"tails.\" Nor is any extravagant\r\nassumption called for as to the intensity of the electrical charge\r\nconcerned in producing these effects. Zöllner, in fact, showed[1269]\r\nthat it need not be higher than that attributed by the best authorities\r\nto the terrestrial surface.\r\n\r\nForty years have elapsed since M. Brédikhine, director successively of\r\nthe Moscow and of the Pulkowa Observatories, turned his attention to\r\nthese curious phenomena. His persistent inquiries on the subject,\r\nhowever, date from the appearance of Coggia's comet in 1874. On\r\ncomputing the value of the repulsive force exerted in the formation of\r\nits tail, and comparing it with values of the same force arrived at by\r\nhim in 1862 for some other conspicuous comets, it struck him that the\r\nnumbers representing them fell into three well-defined classes. \"I\r\nsuspect,\" he wrote in 1877, \"that comets are divisible into groups, for\r\neach of which the repulsive force is perhaps the same.\"[1270] This idea\r\nwas confirmed on fuller investigation. In 1882 the appendages of\r\nthirty-six well-observed comets had been reconstructed theoretically,\r\nwithout a single exception being met with to the rule of the three\r\ntypes. A further study of forty comets led, in 1885, only to a\r\nmodification of the numerical results previously arrived at.\r\n\r\nIn the first of these, the repellent energy of the sun is fourteen times\r\nstronger than his attractive energy;[1271] the particles forming the\r\nenormously long straight rays projected outward from this kind of comet\r\nleave the nucleus with a mean velocity of just seven kilometres per\r\nsecond, which, becoming constantly accelerated, carries them in a few\r\ndays to the limit of visibility. The great comets of 1811, 1843, and\r\n1861, that of 1744 (so far as its principal tail was concerned), and\r\nHalley's comet at its various apparitions, belonged to this class. Less\r\nnarrow limits were assigned to the values of the repulsive force\r\nemployed to produce the second type. For the axis of the tail, it\r\nexceeds by one-tenth (= 1·1) the power of solar gravity; for the\r\nanterior edge, it is more than twice (2·2), for the posterior only half\r\nas strong. The corresponding initial velocity (for the axis) is 1,500\r\nmetres a second, and the resulting appendage a scimitar-like or plumy\r\ntail, such as Donati's and Coggia's comets furnished splendid examples\r\nof. Tails of the third type are constructed with forces of repulsion\r\nfrom the sun ranging from one-tenth to three-tenths that of his gravity,\r\nproducing an accelerated movement of attenuated matter from the nucleus,\r\nbeginning at the leisurely rate of 300 to 600 metres a second. They are\r\nshort, strongly bent, brush-like emanations, and in bright comets seem\r\nto be only found in combination with tails of the higher classes.\r\nMultiple tails, indeed--that is, tails of different types emitted\r\nsimultaneously by one comet--are perceived, as experience advances and\r\nobservation becomes closer, to be rather the rule than the\r\nexception.[1272]\r\n\r\nNow what is the meaning of these three types? Is any translation of them\r\ninto physical fact possible? To this question Brédikhine supplied, in\r\n1879, a plausible answer.[1273] It was already a current surmise that\r\nmultiple tails are composed of different kinds of matter, differently\r\nacted on by the sun. Both Olbers and Bessel had suggested this\r\nexplanation of the straight and curved emanations from the comet of\r\n1807; Norton had applied it to the faint light tracks proceeding from\r\nthat of Donati;[1274] Winnecke to the varying deviations of its more\r\nbrilliant plumage. Brédikhine defined and ratified the conjecture. He\r\nundertook to determine (provisionally as yet) the several kinds of\r\nmatter appropriated severally to the three classes of tails. These he\r\nfound to be hydrogen for the first, hydro-carbons for the second, and\r\niron for the third. The ground of this apportionment is that the atomic\r\nweights of these substances bear to each other the same inverse\r\nproportion as the repulsive forces employed in producing the appendages\r\nthey are supposed to form; and Zöllner had pointed out in 1875 that the\r\n\"heliofugal\" power by which comets' tails are developed would, in fact,\r\nbe effective just in that ratio.[1275] Hydrogen, as the lightest known\r\nelement--that is, the least under the influence of gravity--was\r\nnaturally selected as that which yielded most readily to the\r\ncounter-persuasions of electricity. Hydro-carbons had been shown by the\r\nspectroscope to be present in comets, and were fitted by their specific\r\nweight, as compared with that of hydrogen, to form tails of the second\r\ntype; while the atoms of iron were just heavy enough to compose those of\r\nthe third, and, from the plentifulness of their presence in meteorites,\r\nmight be presumed to enter, in no inconsiderable proportion, into the\r\nmass of comets. These three substances, however, were by no means\r\nsupposed to be the sole constituents of the appendages in question. On\r\nthe contrary, the great breadth of what, for the present, were taken to\r\nbe characteristically \"iron\" tails was attributed to the presence of\r\nmany kinds of matter of high and slightly different specific\r\nweights;[1276] while the expanded plume of Donati was shown to be, in\r\nreality, a whole system of tails, made up of many substances, each\r\nspreading into a separate hollow cone, more or less deviating from, and\r\npartially superposed upon the others.\r\n\r\nYet these felicities of explanation must not make us forget that the\r\nchemical composition attributed to the first type of cometary trains\r\nhas, so far, received no countenance from the spectroscope. The emission\r\nlines of free, incandescent hydrogen have never been derived from any\r\npart of these bodies. Dissentient opinions, accordingly, were expressed\r\nas to the cause of their structural peculiarities. Ranyard,[1277]\r\nZenker, and others advocated the agency of heat repulsion in producing\r\nthem; Kiaer somewhat obscurely explains them through the evolution of\r\ngases by colliding particles;[1278] Herz of Vienna concludes tails to be\r\nmere illusory appendages produced by electrical discharges through the\r\nrare medium assumed to fill space.[1279] But Hirn[1280] conclusively\r\nshowed that no such medium could possibly exist without promptly\r\nbringing ruin upon our \"dædal earth\" and its revolving companions.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, modern researches tend to render superfluous the chemical\r\ndiversities postulated by Brédikhine. Electricity alone seems competent\r\nto produce the varieties of cometary emanation they were designed to\r\naccount for. The distinction of types rests on a solid basis of fact,\r\nbut probably depends upon differences rather in the mode of action than\r\nin the kind of substance acted upon. Suggestive sketches of electrical\r\nand \"light-pressure\" theories of comets have been published respectively\r\nby Mr. Fessenden of Alleghany,[1281] and by M. Arrhenius at\r\nStockholm.[1282] Although evidently of a tentative character, they\r\npossess great interest.\r\n\r\nBrédikhine's hypothesis was promptly and profusely illustrated. Within\r\nthree years of its promulgation, five bright comets made their\r\nappearance, each presenting some distinctive peculiarity by which\r\nknowledge of these curious objects was materially helped forward. The\r\nfirst of these is remembered as the \"Great Southern Comet.\" It was never\r\nvisible in these latitudes, but made a short though stately progress\r\nthrough southern skies. Its earliest detection was at Cordoba on the\r\nlast evening of January, 1880; and it was seen on February 1, as a\r\nluminous streak, extending just after sunset from the south-west horizon\r\ntowards the pole, in New South Wales, at Monte Video, and the Cape of\r\nGood Hope. The head was lost in the solar rays until February 4, when\r\nDr. Gould, then director of the National Observatory of the Argentine\r\nRepublic at Cordoba, caught a glimpse of it very low in the west; and on\r\nthe following evening, Mr. Eddie, at Graham's Town, discovered a faint\r\nnucleus, of a straw-coloured tinge, about the size of the annular nebula\r\nin Lyra. Its condensation, however, was very imperfect, and the whole\r\napparition showed an exceedingly filmy texture. The tail was enormously\r\nlong. On February 5 it extended--large perspective retrenchment\r\nnotwithstanding--over an arc of 50°; but its brightness nowhere exceeded\r\nthat of the Milky Way in Taurus. There was little curvature perceptible;\r\nthe edges of the appendage ran parallel, forming a nebulous causeway\r\nfrom star to star; and the comparison to an auroral beam was\r\nappropriately used. The aspect of the famous comet of 1843 was forcibly\r\nrecalled to the memory of Mr. Janisch, Governor of St. Helena; and the\r\nresemblance proved not merely superficial. But the comet of 1880 was\r\nless brilliant, and even more evanescent. After only eight days of\r\nvisibility, it had faded so much as no longer to strike, though still\r\ndiscoverable by the unaided eye; and on February 20 it was invisible\r\nwith the great Cordoba equatoreal pointed to its known place.\r\n\r\nBut the most astonishing circumstance connected with this body is the\r\nidentity of its path with that of its predecessor in 1843. This is\r\nundeniable. Dr. Gould,[1283] Mr. Hind, and Dr. Copeland,[1284] each\r\ncomputed a separate set of elements from the first rough observations,\r\nand each was struck with an agreement between the two orbits so close as\r\nto render them virtually indistinguishable. \"Can it be possible,\" Mr.\r\nHind wrote to Sir George Airy, \"that there is such a comet in the\r\nsystem, almost grazing the sun's surface in perihelion, and revolving in\r\nless than thirty-seven years. I confess I feel a difficulty in admitting\r\nit, notwithstanding the above extraordinary resemblance of\r\norbits.\"[1285]\r\n\r\nMr. Hind's difficulty was shared by other astronomers. It would, indeed,\r\nbe a violation of common-sense to suppose that a celestial visitant so\r\nstriking in appearance had been for centuries back an unnoticed\r\nfrequenter of our skies. Various expedients, accordingly, were resorted\r\nto for getting rid of the anomaly. The most promising at first sight was\r\nthat of the resisting medium. It was hard to believe that a body,\r\nlargely vaporous, shooting past the sun at a distance of less than a\r\nhundred thousand miles from his surface, should have escaped powerful\r\nretardation. It must have passed through the very midst of the corona.\r\nIt might easily have had an actual encounter with a prominence. Escape\r\nfrom such proximity might, indeed, very well have been judged beforehand\r\nto be impossible. Even admitting no other kind of opposition than that\r\ndubiously supposed to have affected Encke's comet, the result in\r\nshortening the period ought to be of the most marked kind. It was proved\r\nby Oppolzer[1286] that if the comet of 1843 had entered our system from\r\nstellar space with parabolic velocity it would, by the action of a\r\nmedium such as Encke postulated (varying in density inversely as the\r\nsquare of the distance from the sun), have been brought down, by its\r\nfirst perihelion passage, to elliptic movement in a period of\r\ntwenty-four years, with such rapid diminution that its next return would\r\nbe in about ten. But such restricted observations as were available on\r\neither occasion of its visibility gave no sign of such a rapid progress\r\ntowards engulfment.\r\n\r\nAnother form of the theory was advocated by Klinkerfues.[1287] He\r\nsupposed that four returns of the same body had been witnessed within\r\nhistorical memory--the first in 371 b.c., the next in 1668, besides\r\nthose of 1843 and 1880; an original period of 2,039 years being\r\nsuccessively reduced by the withdrawal at each perihelion passage of\r\n1/1320 of the velocity acquired by falling from the far extremity of its\r\norbit towards the sun, to 175 and 37 years. A continuance of the process\r\nwould bring the comet of 1880 back in 1897.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the earliest of these apparitions cannot be identified\r\nwith the recent ones unless by doing violence to the plain meaning of\r\nAristotle's words in describing it. He states that the comet was first\r\nseen \"during the frosts and in the clear skies of winter,\" setting due\r\nwest nearly at the same time as the sun.[1288] This implies some\r\nconsiderable north latitude. But the objects lately observed had\r\npractically _no_ north latitude. They accomplished their entire course\r\n_above_ the ecliptic in two hours and a quarter, during which space they\r\nwere barely separated a hand's-breadth (one might say) from the sun's\r\nsurface. For the purposes of the desired assimilation, Aristotle's comet\r\nshould have appeared in March. It is not credible, however, that even a\r\nnative of Thrace should have termed March \"winter.\"\r\n\r\nWith the comet of 1668 the case seemed more dubious. The circumstances\r\nof its appearance are barely reconcilable with the identity attributed\r\nto it, although too vaguely known to render certainty one way or the\r\nother attainable. It might however, be expected that recent observations\r\nwould at least decide the questions whether the comet of 1843 could have\r\nreturned in less than thirty-seven, and whether the comet of 1880 was to\r\nbe looked for at the end of 17-1/2 years. But the truth is that both\r\nthese objects were observed over so small an arc--8° and 3°\r\nrespectively--that their periods remained virtually undetermined. For\r\nwhile the shape and position of their orbits could be and were fixed\r\nwith a very close approach to accuracy, the length of those orbits might\r\nvary enormously without any very sensible difference being produced in\r\nthe small part of the curves traced out near the sun. Dr. Wilhelm Meyer,\r\nhowever, arrived, by an elaborate discussion, at a period of\r\nthirty-seven years for the comet of 1880,[1289] while the observations\r\nof 1843 were admittedly best fitted by Hubbard's ellipse of 533 years;\r\nbut these Dr. Meyer supposed to be affected by some constant source of\r\nerror, such as would be produced by a mistaken estimate of the position\r\nof the comet's centre of gravity. He inferred finally that, in spite of\r\nprevious non-appearances, the two comets represented a single regular\r\ndenizen of our system, returning once in thirty-seven years along an\r\norbit of such extreme eccentricity that its movement might be described\r\nas one of precipitation towards and rapid escape from the sun, rather\r\nthan of sedate circulation round it.\r\n\r\nThe _geometrical_ test of identity has hitherto been the only one which\r\nit was possible to apply to comets, and in the case before us it may\r\nfairly be said to have broken down. We may, then, tentatively, and with\r\nmuch hesitation, try a _physical_ test, though scarcely yet, properly\r\nspeaking, available. We have seen that the comets of 1843 and 1880 were\r\nstrikingly alike in general appearance, though the absence of a formed\r\nnucleus in the latter, and its inferior brilliancy, detracted from the\r\nconvincing effect of the resemblance. Nor was it maintained when tried\r\nby exact methods of inquiry. M. Brédikhine found that the gigantic ray\r\nemitted in 1843 belonged to his type No. 1; that of 1880 to type No.\r\n2.[1290] The particles forming the one were actuated by a repulsive\r\nforce ten times as powerful as those forming the other. It is true that\r\na second noticeably curved tail was seen in Chili, March 1, and at\r\nMadras, March 11, 1843; and the conjecture was accordingly hazarded that\r\nthe materials composing on that occasion the principal appendage having\r\nbecome exhausted, those of the secondary one remained predominant, and\r\nreappeared alone in the \"hydro-carbon\" train of 1880. But the one known\r\ninstance in point is against such a supposition. Halley's comet, the\r\nonly _great_ comet of which the returns have been securely authenticated\r\nand carefully observed, has preserved its \"type\" unchanged through many\r\nsuccessive revolutions. The dilemma presented to astronomers by the\r\nGreat Southern Comet of 1880 was unexpectedly renewed in the following\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of May, 1881, Mr. John Tebbutt of Windsor, New South Wales,\r\nscanning the western sky, discerned a hazy-looking object which he felt\r\nsure was a strange one. A marine telescope at once resolved it into two\r\nsmall stars and a comet, the latter of which quickly attracted the keen\r\nattention of astronomers; for Dr. Gould, computing its orbit from his\r\nfirst observations at Cordoba, found it to agree so closely with that\r\narrived at by Bessel for the comet of 1807 that he telegraphed to\r\nEurope, June 1, announcing the unexpected return of that body. So\r\nunexpected that theoretically it was not possible before the year 3346;\r\nand Bessel's investigation was one which inspired and eminently deserved\r\nconfidence. Here, then, once more the perplexing choice had to be made\r\nbetween a premature and unaccountable reappearance and the admission of\r\na plurality of comets moving nearly in the same path. But in this case\r\nfacts proved decisive.\r\n\r\nTebbutt's comet passed the sun, June 16, at a distance of sixty-eight\r\nmillions of miles, and became visible in Europe six days later. It was,\r\nin the opinion of some, the finest object of the kind since 1861. In\r\ntraversing the constellation Auriga on its _début_ in these latitudes,\r\nit outshone Capella. On June 24 and some subsequent nights, it was\r\nunmatched in brilliancy by any star in the heavens. In the telescope,\r\nthe \"two interlacing arcs of light\" which had adorned the head of\r\nCoggia's comet were reproduced; while a curious _dorsal spine_ of strong\r\nillumination formed the axis of the tail, which extended in clear skies\r\nover an arc of 20°. It belonged to the same \"type\" as Donati's great\r\nplume; the particles composing it being driven _from_ the sun by a force\r\ntwice as powerful as that urging them _towards_ it.[1291] But the\r\nappendage was, for a few nights, and by two observers perceived to be\r\ndouble. Tempel, on June 27, and Lewis Boss, at Albany (N.Y.), June 26\r\nand 28, saw a long straight ray corresponding to a far higher rate of\r\nemission than the curved train, and shown by Brédikhine to be a member\r\nof the (so-called) hydrogen class. It had vanished by July 1, but made a\r\ntemporary reappearance July 22.[1292]\r\n\r\nThe appendages of this comet were of remarkable transparency.\r\nSmall stars shone wholly undimmed across the tail, and a very nearly\r\ncentral transit of the head over one of the seventh magnitude on the\r\nnight of June 29, produced--if any change--an increase of brilliancy in\r\nthe object of this spontaneous experiment.[1293] Dr. Meyer, indeed, at\r\nthe Geneva Observatory, detected apparent signs of refractive action\r\nupon rays thus transmitted;[1294] but his observations remain isolated,\r\nand were presumably illusory.\r\n\r\nThe track pursued by this comet gave peculiar advantages for its\r\nobservation. Ascending from Auriga through Camelopardus, it stood, July\r\n19, on a line between the Pointers and the Pole, within 8° of the\r\nlatter, and thus remained for a lengthened period constantly above the\r\nhorizon of northern observers. Its brightness, too, was no transient\r\nblaze, but had a lasting quality which enabled it to be kept steadily in\r\nview during nearly nine months. Visible to the naked eye until the end\r\nof August, the last telescopic observation of it was made February 14,\r\n1882, when its distance from the earth considerably exceeded 300 million\r\nmiles. Under these circumstances, the knowledge acquired of its orbit\r\nwas of more than usual accuracy, and showed conclusively that the comet\r\nwas not a simple return of Bessel's; for this would involve a period of\r\nseventy-four years, whereas Tebbutt's comet cannot revisit the sun until\r\nafter the lapse of two and a half millenniums.[1295] Nevertheless, the\r\ntwin bodies move so nearly in the same path that an original connection\r\nof some kind is obvious; and the recent example of Biela readily\r\nsuggested a conjecture as to what the nature of that connection might\r\nhave been. The comets of 1807 and 1881 are, then, regarded with much\r\nprobability as fragments of a primitive disrupted body, one following in\r\nthe wake of the other at an interval of seventy-four years.\r\n\r\nImperfect photographs were taken of Donati's comet both in England and\r\nAmerica;[1296] but Tebbutt's comet was the first to which the process\r\nwas satisfactorily applied. The difficulties to be overcome were very\r\ngreat. The chemical intensity of cometary light is, to begin with,\r\nextraordinarily small. Janssen estimated it at 1/300000 of\r\nmoonlight.[1297] Hence, if the ordinary process by which lunar\r\nphotographs are taken had been applied to the comet of 1881, an exposure\r\nof at least _three days_ would have been required in order to get an\r\nimpression of the head with about a tenth part of the tail. But by that\r\ntime a new method of vastly increased sensitiveness had been rendered\r\navailable, by which dry gelatine-plates were substituted for the wet\r\ncollodion-plates hitherto in use; and this improvement alone reduced the\r\nnecessary time of exposure to two hours. It was brought down to half an\r\nhour by Janssen's employment of a reflector specially adapted to give an\r\nimage illuminated eight or ten times as strongly as that produced in the\r\nfocus of an ordinary telescope.[1298]\r\n\r\nThe photographic feebleness of cometary rays was not the only obstacle\r\nin the way of success. The proper motion of these bodies is so rapid as\r\nto render the usual devices for keeping a heavenly body steadily in view\r\nquite inapplicable. The machinery by which the diurnal movement of the\r\nsphere is followed, must be especially modified to suit each eccentric\r\ncareer. This, too, was done, and on June 30, 1881, Janssen secured a\r\nperfect photograph of the brilliant object then visible, showing the\r\nstructure of the tail with beautiful distinctness to a distance of\r\n2-1/2° from the head. An impression to nearly 10° was obtained about the\r\nsame time by Dr. Henry Draper at New York, with an exposure of 162\r\nminutes.[1299]\r\n\r\nTebbutt's (or comet 1881 iii.) was also the first comet of which the\r\nspectrum was so much as attempted to be chemically recorded. Both\r\nHuggins and Draper were successful in this respect, but Huggins was more\r\ncompletely so.[1300] The importance of the feat consisted in its\r\nthrowing open to investigation a part of the spectrum invisible to the\r\neye, and so affording an additional test of cometary constitution. The\r\nresult was fully to confirm the origin from carbon-compounds assigned to\r\nthe visible rays, by disclosing additional bands belonging to the same\r\nseries in the ultra-violet; as well as to establish unmistakably the\r\npresence of a not inconsiderable proportion of reflected solar light by\r\nthe clear impression of some of the principal Fraunhofer lines. Thus the\r\npolariscope was found to have told the truth, though not the whole\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nThe photograph so satisfactorily communicative was taken by Sir William\r\nHuggins on the night of June 24; and on the 29th, at Greenwich, the\r\ntell-tale Fraunhofer lines were perceived to interrupt the visible range\r\nof the spectrum. This was at first so vividly continuous, that the\r\ncharacteristic cometary bands could scarcely be detached from their\r\nbright background. But as the nucleus faded towards the end of June,\r\nthey came out strongly, and were more and more clearly seen, both at\r\nGreenwich and at Princeton, to agree, not with the spectrum of\r\nhydro-carbons glowing in a vacuum tube, but with that of the same\r\nsubstances burning in a Bunsen flame.[1301] It need not, however, be\r\ninferred that cometary materials are really in a state of combustion.\r\nThis, from all that we know, may be called an impossibility. The\r\nadditional clue furnished was rather to the manner of their electrical\r\nillumination.[1302]\r\n\r\nThe spectrum of the tail was, in this comet, found to be not essentially\r\ndifferent from that of the head. Professor Wright of Yale College\r\nascertained a large percentage of its light to be polarized in a plane\r\npassing through the sun, and hence to be reflected sunlight.[1303] A\r\nfaint continuous spectrum corresponded to this portion of its radiance;\r\nbut gaseous emissions were also present. At Potsdam, on June 30, the\r\nhydro-carbon bands were indeed traced by Vogel to the very end of the\r\ntail;[1304] and they were kept in sight by Young at a greater distance\r\nfrom the nucleus than the more equably dispersed light. There seems\r\nlittle doubt that, as in the solar corona, the relative strength of the\r\ntwo orders of spectra is subject to fluctuations.\r\n\r\nThe comet of 1881 iii. was thus of signal service to science. It\r\nafforded, when compared with the comet of 1807, the first undeniable\r\nexample of two such bodies travelling so nearly in the same orbit as to\r\nleave absolutely no doubt of the existence of a genetic tie between\r\nthem. Cometary photography came to its earliest fruition with it; and\r\ncometary spectroscopy made a notable advance by means of it. Before it\r\nwas yet out of sight, it was provided with a successor.\r\n\r\nAt Ann Arbor Observatory, Michigan, on July 14, a comet was discovered\r\nby Dr. Schaeberle, which, as his claim to priority is undisputed, is\r\noften allowed to bear his name, although designated, in strict\r\nscientific parlance, comet 1881 iv. It was observed in Europe after\r\nthree days, became just discernible by the naked eye at the end of July,\r\nand brightened consistently up to its perihelion passage, August 22,\r\nwhen it was still about fifty million miles from the sun. During many\r\ndays of that month, the uncommon spectacle was presented of two bright\r\ncomets circling together, though at widely different distances, round\r\nthe North pole of the heavens. The newcomer, however, never approached\r\nthe pristine lustre of its predecessor. Its nucleus, when brightest, was\r\ncomparable to the star Cor Caroli, a narrow, perfectly straight ray\r\nproceeding from it to a distance of 10°. This was easily shown by\r\nBrédikhine to belong to the hydrogen type of tails;[1305] while a\r\n\"strange, faint second tail, or bifurcation of the first one,\" observed\r\nby Captain Noble, August 24,[1306] fell into the hydro-carbon class of\r\nemanations. It was seen, August 22 and 24, by Dr. F. Terby of\r\nLouvain,[1307] as a short nebulous brush, like the abortive beginning of\r\na congeries of curving trains; but appeared no more. Its well-attested\r\npresence was significant of the complex constitution of such bodies, and\r\nthe manifold kinds of action progressing in them.\r\n\r\nThe only peculiarity in the spectrum of Schaeberle's comet consisted in\r\nthe almost total absence of continuous light. The carbon-bands were\r\nnearly isolated and very bright. Barely from the nucleus proceeded a\r\nrainbow-tinted streak, indicative of solid or liquid matter, which, in\r\nthis comet, must have been of very scanty amount. Its visit to the sun\r\nin 1881 was, so far as is known, the first. The elements of its orbit\r\nshowed no resemblance to those of any previous comet, nor any marked\r\nsigns of periodicity. So that, although it may be considered probable,\r\nwe do not _know_ that it is moving in a closed curve, or will ever again\r\npenetrate the precincts of the solar system. It was last seen from the\r\nsouthern hemisphere, October 19, 1881.\r\n\r\nThe third of a quartette of lucid comets visible within sixteen months,\r\nwas discovered by Mr. C. S. Wells at the Dudley Observatory, Albany,\r\nMarch 17, 1882. Two days later it was described by Mr. Lewis Boss as \"a\r\ngreat comet in miniature,\" so well defined and regularly developed were\r\nits various parts and appendages. Discernible with optical aid early in\r\nMay, it was on June 5 observed on the meridian at Albany just before\r\nnoon--an astronomical event of extreme rarity. Comet Wells, however,\r\nnever became an object so conspicuous as to attract general attention,\r\nowing to its immersion in the evening twilight of our northern June.\r\n\r\nBut the study of its spectrum revealed new facts of the utmost interest.\r\nAll the comets till then examined had been found (with the two\r\ntransiently observed exceptions already mentioned) to conform to one\r\ninvariable type of luminous emission. Individual distinctions there had\r\nbeen, but no specific differences. Now all these bodies had kept at a\r\nrespectful distance from the sun; for of the great comet of 1880 no\r\nspectroscopic inquiries had been made. Comet Wells, on the other hand,\r\napproached its surface within little more than five million miles on\r\nJune 10, 1882; and the vicinity had the effect of developing a novel\r\nfeature in its incandescence.\r\n\r\nDuring the first half of April its spectrum was of the normal type,\r\nthough the carbon bands were unusually weak; but with approach to the\r\nsun they died out, and the entire light seemed to become concentrated\r\ninto a narrow, unbroken, brilliant streak, hardly to be distinguished\r\nfrom the spectrum of a star. This unusual behaviour excited attention,\r\nand a strict watch was kept. It was rewarded at the Dunecht Observatory,\r\nMay 27, by the discernment of what had never before been seen in a\r\ncomet--the yellow ray of sodium.[1308] By June 1, this had kindled into\r\na blaze overpowering all other emissions. The light of the comet was\r\npractically monochromatic; and the image of the entire head, with the\r\nroot of the tail, could be observed, like a solar prominence, depicted,\r\nin its new saffron vesture of vivid illumination, within the jaws of an\r\nopen slit.\r\n\r\nAt Potsdam, the bright yellow line was perceived with astonishment by\r\nVogel on May 31, and was next evening identified with Fraunhofer's \"D.\"\r\nIts character led him to infer a very considerable density in the\r\nglowing vapour emitting it.[1309] Hasselberg founded an additional\r\nargument in favour of the electrical origin of cometary light on the\r\nchanges in the spectrum of comet Wells.[1310] For they were closely\r\nparalleled by some earlier experiments of Wiedemann, in which the\r\ngaseous spectra of vacuum tubes were at once effaced on the introduction\r\nof metallic vapours. It seemed as if the metal had no sooner been\r\nrendered volatile by heat, than it usurped the entire office of carrying\r\nthe discharge, the resulting light being thus exclusively of its\r\nproduction. Had simple incandescence by heat been in question, the\r\neffect would have been different; the two spectra would have been\r\nsuperposed without prejudice to either. Similarly, the replacement of\r\nthe hydro-carbon bands in the spectrum of the comet by the sodium line\r\nproved electricity to be the exciting agent. For the increasing thermal\r\npower of the sun might, indeed, have ignited the sodium, but it could\r\nnot have extinguished the hydro-carbons.\r\n\r\nSir William Huggins succeeded in photographing the spectrum of comet\r\nWells by an exposure of one hour and a quarter.[1311] The result was to\r\nconfirm the novelty of its character. None of the ultra-violet carbon\r\ngroups were apparent; but certain bright rays, as yet unidentified, had\r\nimprinted themselves. Otherwise the spectrum was strongly continuous,\r\nuninterrupted even by the Fraunhofer lines detected in the spectrum of\r\nTebbutt's comet. Hence it was concluded that a smaller proportion of\r\nreflected light was mingled with the native emissions of the later\r\narrival.\r\n\r\nAll that is certainly known about the _extent_ of the orbit traversed by\r\nthe first comet of 1882 is that it came from, and is now retreating\r\ntowards, vastly remote depths of space. An American computer[1312] found\r\na period indicated for it of no less than 400,000 years; A. Thraen of\r\nDingelstädt arrived at one of 3617.[1313] Both are perhaps equally\r\ninsecure.\r\n\r\nWe have now to give some brief account of one of the most remarkable\r\ncometary apparitions on record, and--with the single exception of that\r\nidentified with the name of Halley--the most instructive to astronomers.\r\nThe lessons learned from it were as varied and significant as its aspect\r\nwas splendid; although from the circumstance of its being visible in\r\ngeneral only before sunrise, the spectators of its splendour were\r\ncomparatively few.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of a great comet at Rio Janeiro, September 11, 1882,\r\nbecame known in Europe through a telegram from M. Cruls, director of the\r\nobservatory at that place. It had, however (as appeared subsequently),\r\nbeen already seen on the 8th by Mr. Finlay of the Cape Observatory, and\r\nat Auckland as early as September 3. A later, but very singularly\r\nconditioned detection, quite unconnected with any of the preceding, was\r\neffected by Dr. Common at Ealing. Since the eclipse of May 17, when a\r\ncomet--named \"Tewfik\" in honour of the Khedive of Egypt--was caught on\r\nDr. Schuster's photographs, entangled, one might almost say, in the\r\nouter rays of the corona, he had scrutinized the neighbourhood of the\r\nsun on the infinitesimal chance of intercepting another such body on its\r\nrapid journey thence or thither. We record with wonder that, after an\r\ninterval of exactly four months, that infinitesimal chance turned up in\r\nhis favour.\r\n\r\nOn the forenoon of Sunday, September 17, he saw a great comet close to,\r\nand rapidly approaching the sun. It was, in fact, then within a few\r\nhours of perihelion. Some measures of position were promptly taken; but\r\na cloud-veil covered the interesting spectacle before mid-day was long\r\npast. Mr. Finlay at the Cape was more completely fortunate. Divided from\r\nhis fellow-observer by half the world, he unconsciously finished, under\r\na clearer sky, his interrupted observation. The comet, of which the\r\nsilvery radiance contrasted strikingly with the reddish-yellow glare of\r\nthe sun's margin it drew near to, was followed \"continuously right into\r\nthe boiling of the limb\"--a circumstance without precedent in cometary\r\nhistory.[1314] Dr. Elkin, who watched the progress of the event with\r\nanother instrument, thought the intrinsic brilliancy of the nucleus\r\nscarcely surpassed by that of the sun's surface. Nevertheless it had no\r\nsooner touched it than it vanished as if annihilated. So sudden was the\r\ndisappearance (at 4h. 50m. 58s., Cape mean time), that the comet was at\r\nfirst believed to have passed _behind_ the sun. But this proved not to\r\nhave been the case. The observers at the Cape had witnessed a genuine\r\ntransit. Nor could non-visibility be explained by equality of\r\nlustre. For the gradations of light on the sun's disc are amply\r\nsufficient to bring out against the dusky background of the limb any\r\nobject matching the brilliancy of the centre; while an object just\r\nequally luminous with the limb must inevitably show dark at the centre.\r\nThe only admissible view, then, is that the bulk of the comet was of too\r\nfilmy a texture, and its presumably solid nucleus too small, to\r\nintercept any noticeable part of the solar rays--a piece of information\r\nworth remembering.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE III.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Great Comet of September, 1882.\r\n\r\nPhotographed at the Royal Observatory, Cape of Good Hope]\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following morning, the object of this unique observation showed\r\n(in Sir David Gill's words) \"an astonishing brilliancy as it rose behind\r\nthe mountains on the east of Table Bay, and seemed in no way diminished\r\nin brightness when the sun rose a few minutes afterward. It was only\r\nnecessary to shade the eye from direct sunlight with the hand at arm's\r\nlength, to see the comet, with its brilliant white nucleus and dense\r\nwhite, sharply bordered tail of quite half a degree in length.\"[1315]\r\nAll over the world, wherever the sky was clear during that day,\r\nSeptember 18, it was obvious to ordinary vision. Since 1843 nothing had\r\nbeen seen like it. From Spain, Italy, Algeria, Southern France,\r\ndespatches came in announcing the extraordinary appearance. At Cordoba,\r\nin South America, the \"blazing star near the sun\" was the one topic of\r\ndiscourse.[1316] Moreover--and this is altogether extraordinary--the\r\nrecords of its daylight visibility to the naked eye extend over three\r\ndays. At Reus, near Tarragona, it showed bright enough to be seen\r\nthrough a passing cloud when only three of the sun's diameters from his\r\nlimb, just before its final rush past perihelion on September 17; while\r\nat Carthagena in Spain, on September 19, it was kept in view during two\r\nhours before and two hours after noon, and was similarly visible in\r\nAlgeria on the same day.[1317]\r\n\r\nBut still more surprising than the appearance of the body itself were\r\nthe nature and relations of the path it moved in. The first rough\r\nelements computed for it by Mr. Tebbutt, Dr. Chandler, and Mr. White,\r\nassistant at the Melbourne Observatory, showed at once a striking\r\nresemblance to those of the twin comets of 1843 and 1880. This\r\nsuggestive fact became known in this country, September 27, through the\r\nmedium of a Dunecht circular. It was fully confirmed by subsequent\r\ninquiries, for which ample opportunities were luckily provided. The\r\nlikeness was not, indeed, so absolutely perfect as in the previous case;\r\nit included some slight, though real differences; but it bore a strong\r\nand unmistakable stamp, broadly challenging explanation.\r\n\r\nTwo hypotheses only were really available. Either the comet of 1882 was\r\nan accelerated return of those of 1843 and 1880, or it was a fragment of\r\nan original mass to which they also had belonged. For the purposes of\r\nthe first view the \"resisting medium\" was brought into full play; the\r\nopinion of its efficacy was for some time both prevalent and popular,\r\nand formed the basis, moreover, of something of a sensational panic. For\r\na comet which, at a single passage through the sun's atmosphere,\r\nencountered sufficient resistance to shorten its period from\r\nthirty-seven to two years and eight months, must, in the immediate\r\nfuture, be brought to rest on his surface; and the solar conflagration\r\nthence ensuing was represented in some quarters, with more licence of\r\nimagination than countenance from science, as likely to be of\r\ncatastrophic import to the inhabitants of our little planet.\r\n\r\nBut there was a test available in 1882 which it had not been possible to\r\napply either in 1843 or in 1880. The two bodies visible in those years\r\nhad been observed only after they had already passed perihelion;[1318]\r\nthe third member of the group, on the other hand, was accurately\r\nfollowed for a week before that event, as well as during many months\r\nafter it. Finlay's and Elkin's observation of its disappearance at the\r\nsun's edge formed, besides, a peculiarly delicate test of its motion.\r\nThe opportunity was thus afforded, by directly comparing the comet's\r\nvelocity before and after its critical plunge through the solar\r\nsurroundings, of ascertaining with approximate certainty whether any\r\nconsiderable retardation had been experienced in the course of that\r\nplunge. The answer distinctly given was that there had not. The computed\r\nand observed places on both sides of the sun fitted harmoniously\r\ntogether. The effect, if any were produced, was too small to be\r\nperceptible.\r\n\r\nThis result is, in itself, a memorable one. It seems to give the _coup\r\nde grâce_ to Encke's theory--discredited, in addition, by Backlund's\r\ninvestigation--of a resisting medium growing rapidly denser inwards. For\r\nthe perihelion distance of the comet of 1882, though somewhat greater\r\nthan that of its predecessors, was nevertheless extremely small. It\r\npassed at less than 300,000 miles of the sun's surface. But the ethereal\r\nsubstance long supposed to obstruct the movement of Encke's comet would\r\nthere be nearly 2,000 times denser than at the perihelion of the smaller\r\nbody, and must have exerted a conspicuous retarding influence. That none\r\nsuch could be detected seems to argue that no such medium exists.\r\n\r\nFurther evidence of a decisive kind was not wanting on the question of\r\nidentity. The \"Great September Comet\" of 1882 was in no hurry to\r\nwithdraw itself from curious terrestrial scrutiny. It was discerned with\r\nthe naked eye at Cordoba as late as March 7, 1883, and still showed in\r\nthe field of the great equatoreal on June 1 as an \"excessively faint\r\nwhiteness.\"[1319] It was then about 480 millions of miles from the\r\nearth--a distance to which no other comet--not even excepting the\r\npeculiar one of 1729--had been pursued.[1320] Moreover, an arc of 340\r\nout of the entire 360 degrees of its circuit had been described under\r\nthe eyes of astronomers; so that its course came to be very well known.\r\nThat its movement is in a very eccentric ellipse, traversed in several\r\nhundred years, was ascertained.[1321] The later inquiries of Dr.\r\nKreutz,[1322] completed in a volume published in 1901,[1323]\r\ndemonstrated the period to be of about 800 years, while that of its\r\npredecessor in 1843 might possibly agree with it, but is much more\r\nprobably estimated at 512 years. The hypothesis that they, or any of the\r\ncomets associated with them, were returns of an individual body is\r\nperemptorily excluded. They may all, however, have been separated from\r\none original mass by the divellent action of the sun at close quarters.\r\nEach has doubtless its own period, since each has most likely suffered\r\nretardations or accelerations special to itself, which, though trifling\r\nin amount, would avail materially to alter the length of the major axis,\r\nwhile leaving the remaining elements of the common orbit virtually\r\nunchanged.[1324]\r\n\r\nA fifth member was added to the family in 1887. On the 18th of January\r\nin that year, M. Thome discovered at Cordoba a comet reproducing with\r\ncurious fidelity the lineaments of that observed in the same latitudes\r\nseven years previously. The narrow ribbon of light, contracting towards\r\nthe sun, and running outward from it to a distance of thirty-five\r\ndegrees; the unsubstantial head--a veiled nothingness, as it appeared,\r\nsince no distinct nucleus could be made out; the quick fading into\r\ninvisibility, were all accordant peculiarities, and they were confirmed\r\nby some rough calculations of its orbit, showing geometrical affinity to\r\nbe no less unmistakable than physical likeness. The observations secured\r\nwere indeed, from the nature of the apparition, neither numerous nor\r\nover-reliable; and the earliest of them dated from a week after\r\nperihelion, passed, almost by a touch-and-go escape, January 11. On\r\nJanuary 27, this mysterious object could barely be discerned\r\ntelescopically at Cordoba.[1325] That it belonged to the series of\r\n\"southern comets\" can scarcely be doubted; but the inference that it was\r\nan actual return of the comet of 1880, improbable in itself, was\r\nnegatived by its non-appearance in 1894. Meyer's incorporation with this\r\nextraordinary group of the \"eclipse-comet\" of 1882[1326] has been\r\napproved by Kreutz, after searching examination.\r\n\r\nThe idea of cometary systems was first suggested by Thomas Clausen in\r\n1831.[1327] It was developed by the late M. Hoek, director of the\r\nUtrecht Observatory, in 1865 and some following years.[1328] He found\r\nthat in quite a considerable number of cases, the paths of two or three\r\ncomets had a common point of intersection far out in space, indicating\r\nwith much likelihood a community of origin. This consisted, according to\r\nhis surmise, in the disruption of a parent mass during its sweep round\r\nthe star latest visited. Be this as it may, the fact is undoubted that\r\nnumerous comets fall into groups, in which similar conditions of motion\r\nbetray a pre-existent physical connection. Never before, however, had\r\ngeometrical relationship been so notorious as between the comets now\r\nunder consideration; and never before, in a comet still, it might be\r\nsaid, in the prime of life, had physical peculiarities tending to\r\naccount for that affinity been so obvious as in the chief member of the\r\ngroup.\r\n\r\nObservation of a granular structure in cometary nuclei dates far back\r\ninto the seventeenth century, when Cysatus and Hevelius described the\r\ncentral parts of the comets of 1618 and 1652 respectively as made up of\r\na congeries of minute stars. Analogous symptoms of a loose state of\r\naggregation have of late been not unfrequently detected in telescopic\r\ncomets, besides the instances of actual division offered by those\r\nconnected with the names of Biela and Liais. The forces concerned in\r\nproducing these effects seem to have been peculiarly energetic in the\r\ngreat comet of 1882.\r\n\r\nThe segmentation of the nucleus was first noticed in the United States\r\nand at the Cape of Good Hope, September 30. It proceeded rapidly. At\r\nKiel, on October 5 and 7, Professor Krüger perceived two centres of\r\ncondensation. A definite and progressive separation into _three_ masses\r\nwas observed by Professor Holden, October 13 and 17.[1329] A few days\r\nlater, M. Tempel found the head to consist of _four_ lucid aggregations,\r\nranged nearly along the prolongation of the caudal axis;[1330] and Dr.\r\nCommon, January 27, 1883, saw _five_ nuclei in a line \"like pearls on a\r\nstring.\"[1331] This remarkable character was preserved to the last\r\nmoment of the comet's distinct visibility. It was a consequence,\r\naccording to Dr. Kreutz, of violent interior action in the comet itself\r\nWhile close to the sun.\r\n\r\nThere were, however, other curious proofs of a disaggregative tendency\r\nin this body. On October 9, Schmidt discovered at Athens a nebulous\r\nobject 4° south-west of the great comet, and travelling in the same\r\ndirection. It remained visible for a few days, and, from Oppenheim's and\r\nHind's calculations, there can be little doubt that it was really the\r\noffspring by fission of the body it accompanied.[1332] This is rendered\r\nmore probable by the unexampled spectacle offered, October 14, to\r\nProfessor Barnard, then of Nashville, Tennessee, of _six or eight_\r\ndistinct cometary masses within 6° south by west of the comet's head,\r\nnone of which reappeared on the next opportunity for a search.[1333] A\r\nweek later, however, one similar object was discerned by Mr. W. R.\r\nBrooks, in the opposite direction from the comet. Thus space appeared to\r\nbe strewn with the filmy débris of this beautiful but fragile structure\r\nall along the track of its retreat from the sun.\r\n\r\nIts tail was only equalled (if it were equalled) in length by that of\r\nthe comet of 1843. It extended in space to the vast distance of 200\r\nmillions of miles from the head; but, so imperfectly were its\r\nproportions displayed to terrestrial observers, that it at no time\r\ncovered an arc of the sky of more than 30°. This apparent extent was\r\nattained, during a few days previous to September 25, by a faint, thin,\r\nrigid streak, noticed only by a few observers--by Elkin at the Cape\r\nObservatory, Eddie at Grahamstown, and Cruls at Rio Janeiro. It diverged\r\nat a low angle from the denser curved train, and was produced, according\r\nto Brédikhine,[1334] by the action of a repulsive force twelve times as\r\nstrong as the counter-pull of gravity. It belonged, that is, to type 1;\r\nwhile the great bifurcate appendage, obvious to all eyes, corresponded\r\nto the lower rate of emission characteristic of type 2. This was\r\nremarkable for the perfect definiteness of its termination, for its\r\nstrongly-forked shape, and for its unusual permanence. Down to the end\r\nof January, 1883, its length, according to Schmidt's observations, was\r\nstill 93 million miles; and a week later it remained visible to the\r\nnaked eye, without notable abridgment.\r\n\r\nMost singular of all was an anomalous extension of the appendage\r\n_towards_ the sun. During the greater part of October and November, a\r\nluminous \"tube\" or \"sheath,\" of prodigious dimensions, seemed to\r\nsurround the head, and project in a direction nearly opposite to that of\r\nthe usual outpourings of attentuated matter. (See Plate III.) Its\r\ndiameter was computed by Schmidt to be, October 15, no less than four\r\nmillion miles, and it was described by Cruls as a \"truncated cone of\r\nnebulosity,\" stretching 3° or 4° sunwards.[1335] This, and the entire\r\nanterior part of the comet, were again surrounded by a thin, but\r\nenormously voluminous paraboloidal envelope, observed by Schiaparelli\r\nfor a full month from October 19.[1336] There can be little doubt that\r\nthese abnormal effluxes were a consequence of the tremendous physical\r\ndisturbance suffered at perihelion; and it is worth remembering that\r\nsomething analogous was observed in the comet of 1680 (Newton's), also\r\nnoted for its excessively close approach to the sun, and possibly moving\r\nin a related orbit. The only plausible hypothesis as to the mode of\r\ntheir production is that of an opposite state of electrification in the\r\nparticles composing the ordinary and extraordinary appendages.\r\n\r\nThe spectrum of the great comet of 1882 was, in part, a repetition of\r\nthat of its immediate predecessor, thus confirming the inference that\r\nthe previously unexampled sodium-blaze was in both a direct result of\r\nthe intense solar action to which they were exposed. But the D line was,\r\nthis time, not seen alone. At Dunecht, on the morning of September 18,\r\nDrs. Copeland and J. G. Lohse succeeded in identifying six brilliant\r\nrays in the green and yellow with as many prominent iron-lines;[1337] a\r\nvery significant addition to our knowledge of cometary constitution, and\r\none which lent countenance to Brédikhine's assumption of various kinds\r\nof matter issuing from the nucleus with velocities inversely as their\r\natomic weights. All the lines equally showed a slight displacement,\r\nindicating a recession from the earth of the radiating body at the rate\r\nof 37 to 46 miles a second. A similar observation, made by M. Thollon at\r\nNice on the same day, gave emphatic sanction to the spectroscopic method\r\nof estimating movement in the line of sight. Before anything was as yet\r\nknown of the comet's path or velocity, he announced, from the position\r\nof the double sodium-line alone, that at 3 p.m. on September 18 it was\r\nincreasing its distance from our planet by from 61 to 76 kilometres per\r\nsecond.[1338] M. Bigourdan's subsequent calculations showed that its\r\nactual swiftness of recession was at that moment 73 kilometres.\r\n\r\nChanges in the inverse order to those seen in the spectrum of comet\r\nWells soon became apparent. In the earlier body, carbon bands had died\r\nout with _approach_ to perihelion, and had been replaced by sodium\r\nemissions; in its successor, sodium emissions became weakened and\r\ndisappeared with _retreat_ from perihelion, and found their substitute\r\nin carbon bands. Professor Riccò was, in fact, able to infer, from the\r\nsequence of prismatic phenomena, that the comet had already passed the\r\nsun; thus establishing a novel criterion for determining the position of\r\na comet in its orbit by the varying quality of its radiations.\r\n\r\nRecapitulating what was learnt from the five conspicuous comets of\r\n1880-82, we find that the leading facts acquired to science were these\r\nthree. First, that comets may be met with pursuing each other, after\r\nintervals of many years, in the same, or nearly the same, track; so that\r\nidentity of orbit can no longer be regarded as a sure test of individual\r\nidentity. Secondly, that at least the outer corona may be traversed by\r\nsuch bodies with perfect apparent impunity. Finally, that their chemical\r\nconstitution is highly complex, and that they possess, in some cases at\r\nleast, a metallic core resembling the meteoric masses which occasionally\r\nreach the earth from planetary space.\r\n\r\nA group of five comets, including Halley's, own a sort of cliental\r\ndependence upon the planet Neptune. They travel out from the sun just to\r\nabout his distance from it, as if to pay homage to a powerful protector,\r\nwho gets the credit of their establishment as periodical visitors to the\r\nsolar system. The second of these bodies to affect a looked-for return\r\nwas a comet--the sixteenth within ten years--discovered by Pons, July\r\n20, 1812, and found by Encke to revolve in an elliptic orbit, with a\r\nperiod of nearly 71 years. It was not, however, until September 1, 1883,\r\nthat Mr. Brooks caught its reappearance; it passed perihelion January\r\n25, and was last seen June 2, 1884. At its brightest, it had the\r\nappearance of a second magnitude star, furnished with a poorly developed\r\ndouble tail, and was fairly conspicuous to the naked eye in Southern\r\nEurope, from December to March. One exceptional feature distinguished\r\nit. Its fluctuations in form and luminosity were unprecedented in\r\nrapidity and extent. On September 21, Dr. Chandler[1339] observed it at\r\nHarvard as a very faint, diffused nebulosity, with slight central\r\ncondensation. On the next night, there was found in its place a bright\r\nstar of the eighth magnitude, scarcely marked out, by a bare trace of\r\nenvironing haze, from the genuine stars it counterfeited. The change was\r\nattended by an eight-fold augmentation of light, and was proved by\r\nSchiaparelli's confirmatory observations[1340] to have been accomplished\r\nwithin a few hours. The stellar disguise was quickly cast aside. The\r\ncomet appeared on September 23 as a wide nebulous disc, and soon after\r\nfaded down to its original dimness. Its distance from the sun was then\r\nno less than 200 million miles, and its spectrum showed nothing unusual.\r\nThese strange variations recurred slightly on October 15, and with\r\nmarked emphasis on January 1, when they were witnessed with amazement,\r\nand photometrically studied by Müller of Potsdam.[1341] The entire cycle\r\nthis time was run through in less than four hours--the comet having, in\r\nthat brief space, condensed, with a vivid outburst of light, into a\r\nseeming star, and the seeming star having expanded back again into a\r\ncomet. Scarcely less transient, though not altogether similar, changes\r\nof aspect were noted by M. Perrotin,[1342] January 13 and 19, 1884. On\r\nthe latter date, the continuous spectrum given by a reddish-yellow disc\r\nsurrounding the true nucleus seemed intensified by bright knots\r\ncorresponding to the rays of sodium.\r\n\r\nA comet discovered by Mr. Sawerthal at the Royal Observatory, Cape of\r\nGood Hope, February 19, 1888, distinguished itself by blazing up, on May\r\n19, to four or five times its normal brilliancy, at the same time\r\nthrowing out from the head two lustrous lateral branches.[1343] These\r\nhad, on June 1, spread backward so as to join the tail, with an effect\r\nlike the playing of a fountain; ten or eleven days later, they had\r\ncompletely disappeared, leaving the comet in its former shape and\r\ninsignificance. Its abrupt display of vitality occurred two full months\r\nafter perihelion.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of July 7, 1889, Mr. W. R. Brooks, of Geneva, New York,\r\neminent as a successful comet-hunter, secured one of his customary\r\ntrophies. The faint object in question was moving through the\r\nconstellation Cetus, and turned out to be a member of Jupiter's numerous\r\nfamily of comets, revolving round the sun in a period of seven years.\r\nIts past history came then, to a certain extent, within the scope of\r\ninvestigation, and proved to have been singularly eventful; nor had the\r\nbody escaped scatheless from the vicissitudes to which it had been\r\nexposed. Observing from Mount Hamilton, August 2 and 5, Professor\r\nBarnard noticed this comet (1889, v.) to be attended in its progress\r\nthrough space by four _outriders_, \"The two brighter companions\" (the\r\nfainter pair survived a very short time) \"were perfect miniatures,\"\r\nProfessor Barnard tells us,[1344] \"of the larger comet, each having a\r\nsmall, fairly defined head and nucleus, with a faint, hazy tail, the\r\nmore distant one being the larger and less developed. The three comets\r\nwere in a straight line, nearly east and west, their tails lying along\r\nthis line. There was no connecting nebulosity between these objects, the\r\ntails of the two smaller not reaching each other, or the large comet. To\r\nall appearance they were absolutely independent comets.\" Nevertheless,\r\nSpitaler, at Vienna, in the early days of August, perceived, as it were,\r\na thin cocoon of nebulosity woven round the entire trio.[1345] One of\r\nthem faded from view September 5; the other actually outshone the\r\noriginal comet on August 31, but was plainly of inferior vitality. It\r\nwas last seen by Barnard on November 25, with the thirty-six inch\r\nrefractor, while its primary afforded an observation for position with\r\nthe twelve-inch, March 20, 1890.[1346] A cause for the disruption it had\r\npresumably undergone had, before then, been plausibly assigned.\r\n\r\nThe adventures of Lexell's comet have long served to exemplify the\r\neffects of Jupiter's despotic sway over such bodies. Although bright\r\nenough in 1770 to be seen with the naked eye, and ascertained to be\r\ncirculating in five and a half years, it had never previously been seen,\r\nand failed subsequently to present itself. The explanation of this\r\nanomaly, suggested by Lexell, and fully confirmed by the analytical\r\ninquiries both of Laplace and Leverrier,[1347] was that a very close\r\napproach to Jupiter in 1767 had completely changed the character of its\r\norbit, and brought it within the range of terrestrial observation; while\r\nin 1779, after having only twice traversed its new path (at its second\r\nreturn it was so circumstanced as to be invisible from the earth), it\r\nwas, by a fresh encounter, diverted into one entirely different. Yet the\r\npossibility was not lost sight of that the great planet, by inverting\r\nits mode of action, might undo its own work, and fling the comet once\r\nmore into the inner part of the solar system. This possibility seemed to\r\nbe realized by Chandler's identification of Brooks's and Lexell's\r\ncomet.[1348] An exceedingly close approach to Jupiter in 1886 had, he\r\nfound reason to believe, produced such extensive alterations in the\r\nelements of its motion as to bring the errant body back to our\r\nneighbourhood in 1889. But his inference, though ratified by Mr. Charles\r\nLane Poor's preliminary calculations, proved dubious on closer inquiry,\r\nand was rendered wholly inadmissible by the circumstances attending the\r\nreturn of Brooks's comet in 1896.[1349] The companion-objects watched by\r\nBarnard in 1889 had by that time, perhaps, become dissipated in space,\r\nfor they were not redetected. They represented, in all likelihood,\r\nwreckage from a collision with Jupiter, dating, perhaps, so far back as\r\n1791, when Mr. Lane Poor found that one of the fateful meetings to which\r\nshort-period comets are especially subject had taken place.\r\n\r\nThe Lexell-Brooks case was almost duplicated by the resemblance to De\r\nVico's lost comet of 1844[1350] of one detected November 20, 1894, by\r\nEdward, son of Lewis Swift. Schulhof[1351] announced the identity, and\r\nChandler,[1352] under reserve, vouched for it. Had the comet continued\r\nto pursue the track laboriously laid down for it at Boston, and shown\r\nitself at the due epoch in 1900, its individuality might have been\r\nconsidered assured; but the formidable vicegerent of the sun once more\r\ninterposed, and, in 1897, swept it out of the terrestrial range of view.\r\nHence the recognition remains ambiguous.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of March 7, 1892, Professor Lewis Swift discovered the\r\nbrightest comet that had been seen by northern observers since 1882.\r\nAbout the time of perihelion, which occurred on April 6, it was\r\nconspicuous, as it crossed the celestial equator from Aquarius towards\r\nPegasus, with a nucleus equal to a third magnitude star, and a tail\r\ntwenty degrees long. This tail was multiple, and multiple in a most\r\ncuriously variable manner. It divided up into many thin nebulous\r\nstreaks, the number and relative lustre of which underwent rapid and\r\nmarked changes. Their permanent record on Barnard's and W. H.\r\nPickering's plates marked a noteworthy advance in cometary photography.\r\nPlate IV. reproduces two of the Lick pictures, taken with a six-inch\r\ncamera, on April 5 and 7 respectively, with, in each case, an exposure\r\nof about one hour. The tail is in the first composed of three main\r\nbranches, the middle one having sprung out since the previous morning,\r\nand the branches are, in their turn, split up into finer rays, to the\r\nnumber of perhaps a dozen in all. In the second a very different state\r\nof things is exhibited. \"The southern component,\" Professor Barnard\r\nremarked, \"which was the brightest on the 5th, had become diffused and\r\nfainter, while the middle tail was very bright and broad. Its southern\r\nside, which was the best defined, was wavy in numerous places, the tail\r\nappearing as if disturbing currents were flowing at right angles to it.\r\nAt 42° from the head the tail made an abrupt bend towards the south, as\r\nif its current was deflected by some obstacle. In the densest portion of\r\nthe tail, at the point of deflection, are a couple of dark holes,\r\nsimilar to those seen in some of the nebulæ. The middle portion of the\r\ntail is brighter, and looks like crumpled silk in places.\"[1353] Next\r\nmorning the southern was the prominent branch, and it was loaded, at 1°\r\n42' from the head, with a strange excrescence, suggesting the\r\nbudding-out of a fresh comet in that incongruous situation.[1354] Some\r\nof these changes, Professor Barnard thought, might possibly be explained\r\nby a rotation of the tail on an axis passing through the nucleus, and\r\nPickering, who formed a similar opinion on independent grounds, assigned\r\nabout 94 hours as the period of the gyrating movement.[1355] He,\r\nmoreover, determined accelerative velocities outward from the sun of\r\ndefinite condensations in the tail, indicating for its materials, on\r\nBrédikhine's theory, a density less than one half that of\r\nhydrogen.[1356] This conclusion applied also to Rordame's comet, which\r\nexhibited a year later phenomena analogous to those remarked in Swift's.\r\nTheir photographic study led Professor Hussey[1357] to significant\r\ninferences as to the structure and rapid changes of cometary appendages.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE IV.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\nPhotographs of Swift's Comet.\r\nBy Professor E. E. Barnard.\r\nNo. 1. Taken April 4, 1892; exposure 1 h.\r\nNo. 2. Taken April 6, 1892; exposure 1 h. 5 m ]\r\n\r\n\r\nSeven comets were detected in 1892, and all, strange to say, were\r\nvisible together towards the close of the year.[1358] Among them was a\r\nfaint object, which unexpectedly left a trail on a plate exposed by\r\nProfessor Barnard to the stars in Aquila[1359] on October 12. This was\r\nthe first comet actually discovered by photography, the Sohag comet\r\nhaving been simultaneously seen and pictured. It has a period of about\r\nsix years. Holmes's comet is likewise periodical, in rather less than\r\nseven years. Its path, which is wholly comprised between the orbits of\r\nMars and Jupiter, is less eccentric than that of any other known comet.\r\nSubsequently to its discovery, on November 6, it underwent some curious\r\nvicissitudes. At first bright and condensed, it expanded rapidly with\r\nincreasing distance from the sun (to which it had made its nearest\r\napproach on June 13), until, by the middle of December, it was barely\r\ndiscernible with powerful telescopes as \"a feebly luminous mist on the\r\nface of the sky.\"[1360] But on January 16, 1893, observers in Europe and\r\nAmerica were bewildered to find, as if substituted for it, a yellow star\r\nof the seventh magnitude, enveloped in a thin nebulous husk, which\r\nenclosed a faint miniature tail.[1361] This condensation and recovery of\r\nlight lasted in its full intensity only a couple of days. The almost\r\nevanescent faintness of Holmes's comet at its next return accounted for\r\nits invisibility previous to 1892, when it was evidently in a state of\r\npeculiar excitement. Mr. Perrine was barely able, with the Lick 36-inch,\r\nto find the vague nebulous patch which occupied its predicted place on\r\nJune 10, 1899.\r\n\r\nThe origin of comets has been long and eagerly inquired into, not\r\naltogether apart from the cheering guidance of ascertained facts. Sir\r\nWilliam Herschel regarded them as fragments of nebulæ[1362]--scattered\r\ndébris of embryo worlds; and Laplace approved of and adopted the\r\nidea.[1363] But there was a difficulty. No comet has yet been observed\r\nto travel in a decided hyperbola. The typical cometary orbit, apart from\r\ndisturbance, is parabolic--that is to say, it is indistinguishable from\r\nan enormously long ellipse. But this circumstance could only be\r\nreconciled with the view that the bodies thus moving were casual\r\nvisitors from outer space, by making, as Laplace did, the tacit\r\nassumption that the solar system was at rest. His reasoning was, indeed,\r\nthereby completely vitiated, as Gauss pointed out in 1815;[1364] and the\r\nobjections then urged were reiterated by Schiaparelli,[1365] who\r\ndemonstrated in 1871 that a large preponderance of well-marked\r\nhyperbolic orbits should result if comets were picked up _en route_ by a\r\nswiftly-advancing sun. The fact that their native movement is\r\npractically parabolic shows it to have been wholly imparted from\r\nwithout. They passively obeyed the pull exerted upon them. In other\r\nwords, their condition previous to being attracted by the sun was one\r\nvery nearly of relative repose.[1366] They shared, accordingly, the\r\nmovement of translation through space of the solar system.\r\n\r\nThis significant conclusion had been indicated, on other grounds, as the\r\nupshot of researches undertaken independently by Carrington[1367] and\r\nMohn[1368] in 1860, with a view to ascertaining the anticipated\r\nexistence of a relationship between the general _lie_ of the paths of\r\ncomets and the direction of the sun's journey. It is tolerably obvious\r\nthat if they wander at haphazard through interstellar regions their\r\napparitions should markedly aggregate towards the vicinity of the\r\nconstellation Lyra; that is to say, we should meet considerably more\r\ncomets than would overtake us, for the very same reason that falling\r\nstars are more numerous after than before midnight. Moreover, the comets\r\nmet by us should be, apparently, swifter-moving objects than those\r\ncoming up with us from behind; because, in the one case, our own real\r\nmovement would be added to, in the other subtracted from, theirs. But\r\nnothing of all this can be detected. Comets approach the sun\r\nindifferently from all quarters, and with velocities quite independent\r\nof direction.\r\n\r\nWe conclude, then, that the \"cosmical current\" which bears the solar\r\nsystem towards its unknown goal carries also with it nebulous masses of\r\nundefined extent, and at an undefined remoteness, fragments detached\r\nfrom which, continually entering the sphere of the sun's attraction,\r\nflit across our skies under the form of comets. These are, however,\r\nalmost certainly so far strangers to our system that they had no part in\r\nthe long processes of development by which its present condition was\r\nattained.

Custom can never blunt the wonder with which we must\r\nregard the achievement of compelling rays emanating from a source devoid\r\nof sensible magnitude through immeasurable distance, to reveal, by its\r\ndistinctive qualities, the composition of that source. The discovery of\r\nrevolving double stars assured us that the great governing force of the\r\nplanetary movements, and of our own material existence, sways equally\r\nthe courses of the farthest suns in space; the application of prismatic\r\nanalysis certified to the presence in the stars of the familiar\r\nmaterials, no less of the earth we tread, than of the human bodies built\r\nup out of its dust and circumambient vapours.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that, as early as 1823, Fraunhofer ascertained the generic\r\nparticipation of stellar light in the peculiarity by which sunlight,\r\nspread out by transmission through a prism, shows numerous transverse\r\nrulings of interrupting darkness. No sooner had Kirchhoff supplied the\r\nkey to the hidden meaning of those ciphered characters than it was\r\neagerly turned to the interpretation of the dim scrolls unfolded in the\r\nspectra of the stars. Donati made at Florence in 1860 the first efforts\r\nin this direction; but with little result, owing to the imperfections of\r\nthe instrumental means at his command. His comparative failure, however,\r\nwas a prelude to others' success. Almost simultaneously, in 1862, the\r\nnovel line of investigation was entered upon by Huggins near London, by\r\nFather Secchi at Rome, and by Lewis M. Rutherfurd in New York.\r\nFraunhofer's device of using a cylindrical lens for the purpose of\r\ngiving a second dimension to stellar spectra was adopted by all, and\r\nwas, indeed, indispensable. For a luminous point, such as a star\r\nappears, becomes, when viewed through a prism, a variegated line, which,\r\nuntil broadened into a band by the intervention of a cylindrical lens,\r\nis all but useless for purposes of research. This process of _rolling\r\nout_ involves, it is true, much loss of light--a scanty and precious\r\ncommodity, as coming from the stars; but the loss is an inevitable one.\r\nAnd so fully is it compensated by the great light-grasping power of\r\nmodern telescopes that important information can now be gained from the\r\nspectroscopic examination of stars far below the range of the unarmed\r\neye.\r\n\r\nThe effective founders of stellar spectroscopy, then (since Rutherfurd\r\nshortly turned his efforts elsewhither), were Father Secchi, the eminent\r\nJesuit astronomer of the Collegio Romano, where he died, February 26,\r\n1878, and Sir William Huggins, with whom the late Professor W. A. Miller\r\nwas associated. The work of each was happily directed so as to\r\nsupplement that of the other. With less perfect appliances, the Roman\r\nastronomer sought to render his extensive rather than precise; at Tulse\r\nHill searching accuracy over a narrow range was aimed at and attained.\r\nTo Father Secchi is due the merit of having executed the first\r\nspectroscopic survey of the heavens. Above 4,000 stars were passed in\r\nreview by him, and classified according to the varying qualities of\r\ntheir light. His provisional establishment (1863-67) of four types of\r\nstellar spectra[1369] has proved a genuine aid to knowledge through the\r\nfacilities afforded by it for the arrangement and comparison of rapidly\r\naccumulating facts. Moreover, it is scarcely doubtful that these\r\nspectral distinctions correspond to differences in physical condition of\r\na marked kind.\r\n\r\nThe first order comprises more than half the visible and probably an\r\noverwhelming proportion of the faintest stars. Sirius, Vega, Regulus,\r\nAltair, are amongst its leading members. Their spectra are distinguished\r\nby the breadth and intensity of the four dark bars due to the absorption\r\nof hydrogen, and by the extreme faintness of the metallic lines, of\r\nwhich, nevertheless, hundreds are disclosed by careful examination. The\r\nlight of these \"Sirian\" orbs is white or bluish; and it is found to be\r\nrich in ultra-violet rays.\r\n\r\nCapella and Arcturus belong to the second, or solar type of stars, which\r\nis about one-sixth less numerously represented than the first. Their\r\nspectra are quite closely similar to that of sunlight, in being ruled\r\nthroughout by innumerable fine dark lines; and they share its yellowish\r\ntinge.\r\n\r\nThe third class includes most red and variable stars (commonly\r\nsynonymous), of which Betelgeux in the shoulder of Orion, and \"Mira\" in\r\nthe Whale, are noted examples. Their characteristic spectrum is of the\r\n\"fluted\" description. It shows like a strongly illuminated range of\r\nseven or eight variously tinted columns seen in perspective, the light\r\nfalling from the red end towards the violet. This _kind_ of absorption\r\nis produced by the vapours of metalloids or of compound substances.\r\n\r\nTo the fourth order of stars belongs also a colonnaded spectrum, but\r\n_reversed_; the light is thrown the other way. The three broad zones of\r\nabsorption which interrupt it are sharp towards the red, insensibly\r\ngradated towards the violet end. The individuals composing Class IV. are\r\nfew and apparently insignificant, the brightest of them not exceeding\r\nthe fifth magnitude. They are commonly distinguished by a deep red tint,\r\nand gleam like rubies in the field of the telescope. Father Secchi, who\r\nin 1867 detected the peculiarity of their analyzed light, ascribed it to\r\nthe presence of carbon in some form in their atmospheres; and this was\r\nconfirmed by the researches of H. C. Vogel,[1370] director of the\r\nAstro-physical Observatory at Potsdam. The hydro-carbon bands, in fact,\r\nseen bright in comets, are dark in these singular objects--the only ones\r\nin the heavens (save one bright-line star and a rare meteor)[1371] which\r\ndisplay a cometary analogy of the fundamental sort revealed by the\r\nspectroscope.\r\n\r\nThe members of all four orders are, however, emphatically suns. They\r\npossess, it would appear, photospheres radiating all kinds of light, and\r\ndiffer from each other mainly in the varying qualities of their\r\nabsorptive atmospheres. The principle that the colours of stars depend,\r\nnot on the intrinsic nature of their light, but on the kinds of vapours\r\nsurrounding them, and stopping out certain portions of that light, was\r\nlaid down by Huggins in 1864.[1372] The phenomena of double stars seem\r\nto indicate a connection between the state of the investing atmospheres,\r\nby the action of which their often brilliantly contrasted tints are\r\nproduced, and their mutual physical relations. A tabular statement put\r\nforward by Professor Holden in June, 1880,[1373] made it, at any rate,\r\nclear that inequality of magnitude between the components of binary\r\nsystems accompanies unlikeness in colour, and that stars more equally\r\nmatched in one respect are pretty sure to be so in the other. Besides,\r\nblue and green stars of a decided tinge are never solitary; they\r\ninvariably form part of systems. So that association has undoubtedly a\r\npredominant influence upon colour.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the crude notion thrown out by Zöllner in 1865,[1374] that\r\nyellow and red stars are simply white stars in various stages of\r\ncooling, obtained for a time undeserved currency. D'Arrest, indeed,\r\nprotested against it, and Ångström, in 1868,[1375] substituted\r\natmospheric quality for mere colour[1376] as a criterion of age and\r\ntemperature. His lead was followed by Lockyer in 1873,[1377] and by\r\nVogel in 1874.[1378] The scheme of classification due to the Potsdam\r\nastro-physicist differed from Father Secchi's only in presenting his\r\nthird and fourth types as subdivisions of the same order, and in\r\ninserting three subordinate categories; but their variety was\r\n\"rationalised\" by the addition of the seductive idea of progressive\r\ndevelopment. Thus, the white Sirian stars were represented as the\r\n_youngest_ because the hottest of the sidereal family; those of the\r\nsolar pattern as having already wasted much of their store by radiation,\r\nand being well advanced in middle life; while the red stars with banded\r\nspectra figured as effete suns, hastening rapidly down the road to final\r\nextinction.\r\n\r\nVogel's scheme is, however, incomplete. It traces the downward curve of\r\ndecay, but gives no account of the slow ascent to maturity. The present\r\nsplendour of Vega, for instance, was prepared, according to all creative\r\nanalogy, by almost endless processes of gradual change. What was its\r\nantecedent condition? The question has been variously answered. Dr.\r\nJohnstone Stoney advocated, in 1867, the comparative youth of red\r\nstars;[1379] A. Ritter, of Aix-la-Chapelle, divided them, in 1883,[1380]\r\ninto two squadrons, posted, the one on the ascending, the other on the\r\ndescending branch of the temperature-curve, and corresponding,\r\npresumably, with Secchi's third and fourth orders of stars with banded\r\nspectra. Whether, in the interim, they should display spectra of the\r\nSirian or of the solar type was made to depend on their greater or less\r\nmassiveness.[1381] But the relation actually existing perhaps inverts\r\nthat contemplated by Ritter. Certainly, the evidence collected by Mr.\r\nMaunder in 1891 strongly supports the opinion that the average solar\r\nstar is a weightier body than the average Sirian star.[1382]\r\n\r\nOn November 17, 1887, Sir Norman Lockyer communicated to the Royal\r\nSociety the first of a series of papers embodying his \"Meteoritic\r\nHypothesis\" of cosmical constitution, stated and supported more at large\r\nin a separate work bearing that name, published in 1890. The fundamental\r\nproposition wrought out in it was that \"all self-luminous bodies in the\r\ncelestial space are composed either of swarms of meteorites or of masses\r\nof meteoric vapour produced by heat.\"[1383] On the basis of this\r\nsupposed community of origin, sidereal objects were distributed in seven\r\ngroups along a temperature-curve ascending from nebulæ and gaseous, or\r\nbright-line stars, through red stars of the third type, and a younger\r\ndivision of solar stars, to the high Sirian level; then descending\r\nthrough the more strictly solar stars to red stars of the fourth type\r\n(\"carbon-stars\"), below which lay only the _caput mortuum_ entitled\r\nGroup vii. The ground-work of this classification was, however,\r\ninsecure, and has given way. Certain spectroscopic coincidences,\r\navowedly only approximate, suggesting that stars and nebulæ of every\r\nspecies might be formed out of variously aggregated meteorites, failed\r\nof verification by exact inquiry. And spectroscopic coincidences admit\r\nof no compromise. Those that are merely approximate are, as a rule,\r\nunmeaning.\r\n\r\nIn his Presidential Address at the Cardiff Meeting of the British\r\nAssociation in 1891, Dr. Huggins adhered in the main to the line of\r\nadvance traced by Vogel. The inconspicuousness of metallic lines in the\r\nspectra of the white stars he attributed, not to the paucity, but to the\r\nhigh temperature of the vapours producing them, and the consequent\r\ndeficiency of contrast between their absorption-rays and the continuous\r\nlight of the photospheric background. \"Such a state of things would more\r\nprobably,\" in his opinion, \"be found in conditions anterior to the solar\r\nstage,\" while \"a considerable cooling of the sun would probably give\r\nrise to banded spectra due to compounds.\" He adverted also to the\r\ninfluential effects upon stellar types of varying surface gravity, which\r\nbeing a function of both mass and bulk necessarily gains strength with\r\nwasting heat and consequent shrinkage. The same leading ideas were more\r\nfully worked out in \"An Atlas of Representative Stellar Spectra,\"\r\npublished by Sir William and Lady Huggins in 1899. They were, moreover,\r\nsplendidly illustrated by a set of original spectrographic plates, while\r\nprecision was added to the adopted classification by the separation of\r\nhelium from hydrogen stars. The spectrum of the exotic substance\r\nterrestrially captured in 1895 is conspicuous by absorption, as Vogel,\r\nLockyer, and Deslandres promptly recognised in a considerable number of\r\nwhite stars, among them the Pleiades and most of the brilliants in\r\nOrion. Mr. McClean, whose valuable spectrographic survey of the heavens\r\nwas completed at the Cape in 1897, found reason to conclude that they\r\nare in the first stage of development from gaseous nebulæ;[1384] and in\r\nthis the Tulse Hill investigators unhesitatingly concur.\r\n\r\nThe strongest evidence for the primitive state of white stars is found\r\nin their nebular relations. The components of groups, still involved and\r\nentangled with \"silver braids\" of cosmic mist, show, perhaps invariably,\r\nspectra of the helium type, occasionally crossed by bright rays.\r\nPossibly all such stars have passed through a bright-line stage; but\r\nfurther evidence on the point is needed. Relative density furnishes\r\nanother important test of comparative age, and Sirian stars are, on the\r\nwhole, undoubtedly more bulky proportionately to their mass than solar\r\nstars. The rule, however, seems to admit of exceptions; hence the change\r\nfrom one kind of spectrum to the other is not inevitably connected with\r\nthe attainment of a particular degree of condensation. There is reason\r\nto believe that it is anticipated in the more massive globes, despite\r\ntheir comparatively slow cooling, as a consequence of the greater power\r\nof gravity over their investing vaporous envelopes. This conclusion is\r\nenforced by the relations of double-star spectra. The fact that, in\r\nunequal pairs, the chief star most frequently shows a solar, its\r\ncompanion a Sirian, spectrum can scarcely be otherwise explained than by\r\nadmitting that, while the sequence of types is pursued in an invariable\r\norder, it is pursued much more rapidly in larger than in small orbs. It\r\nneed not, indeed, be supposed that all stars are identical in\r\nconstitution, and present identical life-histories.[1385]\r\nIndividualities in the one, and divergencies in the other, must be\r\nallowed for. Yet the main track is plainly continuous, and leads by\r\ninsensible gradations from nebulæ through helium stars to the Sirian,\r\nand onward to the solar type, whence, by an inevitable transition,\r\nfluted, or \"Antarian,\"[1386] spectra develop.\r\n\r\nThe first-known examples of the class of gaseous stars--Beta Lyræ\r\nand Gamma Cassiopeiæ--were noticed by Father Secchi at the outset\r\nof his spectroscopic inquiries. Both show _bright_ lines of hydrogen and\r\nhelium, so that the peculiarity of their condition probably consists in\r\nthe intense ignition of their chromospheric surroundings. Their entire\r\nradiating surfaces might be described as _faculous_. That is to say,\r\nbrilliant formations, such as have been photographed by Professor Hale\r\non the sun's disc,[1387] cover, perhaps, the whole, instead of being\r\nlimited to a small portion of the photospheric area. But this state of\r\nthings is more or less inconstant. Some at least of the bright rays\r\nindicative of it are subject to temporary extinctions. Already in\r\n1871-72, Dr. Vogel[1388] suspected the prevalence of such vicissitudes;\r\nand their reality was ascertained by M. Eugen von Gothard. After the\r\ncompletion of his new astrophysical observatory at Herény in the autumn\r\nof 1881, he repeatedly observed the spectra of both stars without\r\nperceiving a trace of bright lines; and was thus taken quite by surprise\r\nwhen he caught a twinkling of the crimson C in Gamma Cassiopeiæ,\r\nAugust 13, 1883.[1389] A few days later, the whole range including D_3\r\nwas lustrous. Duly apprised of the recurrence of a phenomenon he had\r\nhimself vainly looked for during some years, M. von Konkoly took the\r\nopportunity of the great Vienna refractor being placed at his disposal\r\nto examine with it the relighted spectrum on August 27.[1390] In its\r\nwealth of light C was dazzling; D_3 and the green and blue hydrogen rays\r\nshone somewhat less vividly; D and the group _b_ showed faintly dark;\r\nwhile three broad absorption-bands, sharply terminated towards the red,\r\ndiffuse towards the violet, shaded the spectrum near its opposite\r\nextremities.\r\n\r\nThe previous absence of bright lines from the spectrum of this star was,\r\nhowever, by no means so protracted or complete as M. von Gothard\r\nsupposed. At Dunecht, C was \"superbly visible\" December 20, 1879[1391];\r\nF was seen bright on October 28 of the same year, and frequently at\r\nGreenwich in 1880-81. The curious fact has, moreover, been adverted to\r\nby Dr. Copeland, that C _is much more variable than F_. To Vogel, June\r\n18, 1872, the first was invisible, while the second was bright; at\r\nDunecht, January 11, 1887, the conditions were so far inverted that C\r\nwas resplendent, F comparatively dim.\r\n\r\nNo spectral fluctuations were detected in Gamma Cassiopeiæ by\r\nKeeler in 1889; but even with the giant telescope of Mount Hamilton, the\r\nhelium-ray was completely invisible.[1392] It made, nevertheless,\r\ncapricious appearances at South Kensington during that autumn, and again\r\nOctober 21, 1894,[1393] while in September, 1892, Bélopolsky could\r\nobtain no trace of it on orthochromatic plates exposed with the 30-inch\r\nPulkowa refractor.[1394] Still more noteworthy is the circumstance that\r\nthe well-known green triplet of magnesium (_b_), recorded as dark by\r\nKeeler in 1889, came out bright on fifty-two spectrographs of the star\r\ntaken by Father Sidgreaves during the years 1891-99.[1395] No\r\nfluctuations in the hydrogen-spectrum were betrayed by them; but\r\nsubordinate lines of unknown origin showed alternate fading and\r\nvivification.\r\n\r\nThe spectrum of Beta Lyræ undergoes transitions to some extent\r\nanalogous, yet involving a different set of considerations. First\r\nnoticed by Von Gothard in 1882,[1396] they were imperfectly made out,\r\ntwo years later, to be of a cyclical character.[1397] This, however,\r\ncould only be effectively determined by photographic means. Beta Lyræ is\r\na \"short-period variable.\" Its light changes with great regularity from\r\n3·4 to 4·4 magnitude every twelve days and twenty-two hours, during\r\nwhich time it attains a twofold maximum, with an intervening secondary\r\nminimum. The question, then, is of singular interest, whether the\r\nchanges of spectral quality visible in this object correspond to its\r\nchanges in visual brightness. A distinct answer in the affirmative was\r\nsupplied through Mrs. Fleming's examination of the Harvard plates of the\r\nstar's spectrum, upon which, in 1891, she found recorded diverse complex\r\nchanges of bright and dark lines obviously connected with the phases of\r\nluminous variation, and obeying, in the long-run, precisely the same\r\nperiod.[1398] Something more will be said presently as to the import of\r\nthis discovery.\r\n\r\nBright hydrogen lines have so far been detected--for the most part\r\nphotographically at Harvard College--in about sixty stars, including\r\nPleione, the surmised lost Pleiad, P Cygni, noted for instability of\r\nlight in the seventeenth century, and the extraordinary southern\r\nvariable, Eta Carinæ. In most of these objects other vivid rays\r\nare associated with those due to hydrogen. A blaze of hydrogen,\r\nmoreover, accompanies the recurring outbursts of about one hundred and\r\nfifty \"long-period variables,\" giving banded spectra of the third type.\r\nProfessor Pickering discovered the first example of this class, towards\r\nthe close of 1886, in Mira Ceti; further detections were made visually\r\nby Mr. Espin; and the conjunction of bright hydrogen-lines with dusky\r\nbands has been proved by Mrs. Fleming's long experience in studying the\r\nHarvard photographs, to indicate unerringly the subjection of the stars\r\nthus characterised to variations of lustre accomplished in some months.\r\n\r\nA third variety of gaseous star is named after MM. Wolf and Rayet, who\r\ndiscovered, at Paris in 1867,[1399] its three typical representatives,\r\nclose together in the constellation Cygnus. Six further specimens were\r\ndiscovered by Dr. Copeland, five of them in the course of a trip for the\r\nexploration of visual facilities in the Andes in 1883;[1400] and a large\r\nnumber have been made known through spectral photographs taken in both\r\nhemispheres under Professor Pickering's direction. At the close of the\r\nnineteenth century, over a hundred such objects had been registered,\r\nnone brighter than the sixth magnitude, with the single exception of\r\nGamma Argûs, the resplendent continuous spectrum of which, first\r\nexamined by Respighi and Lockyer in 1871, is embellished with the yellow\r\nand blue rays distinctive of the type.[1401] Here, then, we have a\r\nstellar globe apparently at the highest point of sunlike incandescence,\r\nsharing the peculiarities of bodies verging towards the nebulous state.\r\nExamined with instruments of adequate power, their spectra are seen to\r\nbe highly complex. They include a fairly strong continuous element, a\r\nnumerous set of absorption-lines, and a range of emission-lines, more or\r\nless completely represented in different stars. Especially conspicuous\r\nis a broad effluence of azure light, found by Dr. Vogel in 1883,[1402]\r\nand by Sir William and Lady Huggins in 1890,[1403] to be of multiple\r\nstructure, and hence to vary in its mode of display. Its suggested\r\nidentification with the blue carbon-fluting was disproved at Tulse Hill.\r\nMetallic vapours give no certain sign of their presence in the\r\natmospheres of these remarkable bodies; but nebulum is stated to shine\r\nin some.[1404] Hydrogen and helium account for a large proportion of\r\ntheir spectral rays. Thirty-two Wolf-Rayet stars were investigated,\r\nspectroscopically and spectrographically, by Professor Campbell with the\r\ngreat Lick refractor in 1892-94;[1405] and several disclosed the\r\nsingularity, already noticed by him in Gamma Argûs, of giving out\r\nmixed series, the members of which change from vivid to obscure with\r\nincrease of refrangibility. It is difficult to imagine by what\r\nchromospheric machinery this curious result can be produced. Alcyone in\r\nthe Pleiades presents the same characteristic. Alone among the hydrogen\r\nlines, crimson C glows in its spectrum, while all the others are dark.\r\nLuminosity of the Wolf-Rayet kind is particularly constant, both in\r\nquantity and quality. It seems to be incapable of developing save under\r\ngalactic conditions. All the stars marked by it lie near the central\r\nline of the Milky Way, or in the Magellanic Clouds. They tend also to\r\ngather into groups. Circles of four degrees radius include respectively\r\nseven in Argo, eight in Cygnus.\r\n\r\nThe first spectroscopic star catalogue was published by Dr. Vogel at\r\nPotsdam in 1883.[1406] It included 4,051 stars, distributed over a zone\r\nof the heavens extending from 20° north to 20° south of the celestial\r\nequator.[1407] More than half of these were white stars, while red stars\r\nwith banded spectra occurred in the proportion of about one-thirteenth\r\nof the whole. To the latter genus, M. Dunér, then of Lund, now Director\r\nof the Upsala Observatory, devoted a work of standard authority, issued\r\nat Stockholm in 1884. This was a catalogue with descriptive particulars\r\nof 352 stars showing banded spectra, 297 of which belong to Secchi's\r\nthird, 55 to his fourth class (Vogel's iii. _a_ and iii. _b_). Since\r\nthen discovery has progressed so rapidly, at first through the\r\ntelescopic reviews of Mr. Espin, then in the course of the photographic\r\nsurvey carried on at Harvard College, that considerably over one\r\nthousand stars are at present recognised as of the family of Betelgeux\r\nand Mira, while about 250 have so far exhibited the spectral pattern of\r\n19 Piscium. One fact well ascertained as regards both species is the\r\ninvariability of the type. The prismatic flutings of the one, and the\r\nbroader zones of the other, are as if stereotyped--they undergo, in\r\ntheir fundamental outlines, no modification, though varying in relative\r\nintensity from star to star. They are always accompanied by, or\r\nsuperposed upon, a spectrum of dark lines, in producing which sodium and\r\niron have an obvious share; and certain bright rays, noticed by Secchi\r\nwith imperfect appliances as enhancing the chiaroscuro effects in\r\ncarbon-stars, came out upon plates exposed by Hale and Ellerman in 1898\r\nwith the stellar spectrograph of the Yerkes Observatory.[1408] Their\r\ngenuineness was shortly afterwards visually attested by Keeler,\r\nCampbell, and Dunér;[1409] but no chemical interpretation has been found\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\nA fairly complete preliminary answer to the question, What are the stars\r\nmade of? was given by Sir William Huggins in 1864.[1410] By laborious\r\nprocesses of comparison between stellar dark lines and the bright rays\r\nemitted by terrestrial substances, he sought to assure his conclusions,\r\nregardless of cost in time and pains. He averred, indeed, that--taking\r\ninto account restrictions by weather and position--the thorough\r\ninvestigation of a _single_ star-spectrum would be the work of some\r\nyears. Of two, however--those of Betelgeux and Aldebaran--he was able to\r\nfurnish detailed and accurate drawings. The dusky flutings in the\r\nprismatic light of the first of these stars have not been identified\r\nwith the absorption of any particular substance; but associated with\r\nthem are metallic lines, of which 78 were measured, and a good many\r\nidentified by Huggins, while the wave-lengths of 97 were determined by\r\nVogel in 1871.[1411] A photographic research, made by Keeler at the\r\nAlleghany Observatory in 1897, convinced him that the linear spectrum of\r\nthird-type stars of the Betelgeux pattern essentially repeats that of\r\nthe sun, but with marked differences in the comparative strength of its\r\ncomponents.[1412] Hydrogen rays are inconspicuously present. That an\r\nexalted temperature reigns, at least in the lower strata of the\r\natmosphere, is certified by the vaporisation there of matter so\r\nrefractory to heat as iron.[1413]\r\n\r\nNine elements--among them iron, sodium, calcium, and magnesium--were\r\nrecognised by Huggins as having stamped their signature on the spectrum\r\nof Aldebaran; while the existence in Sirius, and nearly all the other\r\nstars inspected, of hydrogen, together with sundry metals, was rendered\r\ncertain or highly probable. This was admitted to be a bare gleaning of\r\nresults; nor is there reason to suppose any of his congeners inferior to\r\nour sun in complexity of constitution. Definite knowledge on the\r\nsubject, however, made little advance beyond the point to which it was\r\nbrought by Huggins's early experiments until spectroscopic photography\r\nbecame thoroughly effective as a means of research.\r\n\r\nIn this, as in so many other directions, Sir William Huggins acted as\r\npioneer. In March, 1863, he obtained microscopic prints of the spectra\r\nof Sirius and Capella.[1414] But they told nothing. No lines were\r\nvisible in them. They were mere characterless streaks of light. Nine\r\nyears later Dr. Henry Draper of New York got an impression of four lines\r\nin the spectrum of Vega. Then Huggins attacked the subject again in\r\n1876, when the 18-inch speculum of the Royal Society had come into his\r\npossession, using prisms of Iceland spar and lenses of rock crystal; and\r\nthis time with better success. A photograph of the spectrum of Vega\r\nshowed seven strong lines.[1415] Still he was not satisfied. He waited\r\nand worked for three years longer. At length, on December 18, 1879, he\r\nwas able to communicate to the Royal Society[1416] results answering to\r\nhis expectations. The delicacy of eye and hand needed to obtain them may\r\nbe estimated from the single fact that the image of a star had to be\r\nkept, by continual minute adjustments, exactly projected upon a slit\r\n1/350 of an inch in width during nearly an hour, in order to give it\r\ntime to imprint the characters of its analyzed light upon a gelatine\r\nplate raised to the highest pitch of sensitiveness. But by this time he\r\nhad secured in his wife a rarely qualified assistant.\r\n\r\nThe ultra-violet spectrum of the white stars--of which Vega was taken as\r\nthe type--was thus shown to be a very remarkable one. A group of broad\r\ndark lines intersected it, arranged at intervals diminishing regularly\r\nupward, and falling into a rhythmical succession with the visible\r\nhydrogen lines. All belonged presumably to the same substance; and the\r\npresumption was rendered a certainty by direct photographs of the\r\nhydrogen spectrum taken by H. W. Vogel at Berlin a few months\r\nearlier.[1417] In them seven of the white-star series of grouped lines\r\nwere visible; and the full complement of twelve appeared on Cornu's\r\nplates in 1886.[1418]\r\n\r\nIn yellow stars, such as Capella and Arcturus, the same rhythmical\r\nseries was _partially_ represented, but associated with a great number\r\nof other lines; their state, as regards ultra-violet absorption,\r\napproximating to that of the sun; while the redder stars betrayed so\r\nmarked a deficiency in actinic rays that from Betelgeux, with an\r\nexposure _forty times_ that required for Sirius, only a faint spectral\r\nimpression could be obtained, and from Aldebaran, in the strictly\r\ninvisible region, almost none at all.\r\n\r\nThus, by the means of stellar light-analysis, acquaintance was first\r\nmade with the ultra-violet spectrum of hydrogen;[1419] and its harmonic\r\ncharacter, as expressed by \"Balmer's Law,\" supplies a sure test for\r\ndiscriminating, among newly discovered lines, those that appertain from\r\nthose that are unrelated to it. Deslandres' five additional\r\nprominence-rays, for instance, were at once seen to make part of the\r\nseries, because conforming to its law;[1420] while a group of six dusky\r\nbands, photographed by Sir William and Lady Huggins, April 4,\r\n1890,[1421] near the extreme upper end of the spectrum of Sirius, were\r\npronounced without hesitation, for the opposite reason, to have nothing\r\nto do with hydrogen. Their true affinities are still a matter for\r\ninquiry.\r\n\r\nAs regards the hydrogen spectrum, however, the stars had further\r\ninformation in reserve. Until recently, it was supposed to consist of a\r\nsingle harmonic series, although, by analogy, three should co-exist. In\r\n1896, accordingly, a second, bound to the first by unmistakable\r\nnumerical relationships, was recognised by Professor Pickering in\r\nspectrographs of the 2·5 magnitude star Zeta Puppis,[1422] and the\r\nidentification was shortly afterwards extended to prominent Wolf-Rayet\r\nemission lines. The discovery was capped by Dr. Rydberg's indication of\r\nthe Wolf-Rayet blue band at Lambda 4,688 as the fundamental member\r\nof the third, and principal, hydrogen series.[1423] None of the\r\n\"Pickering lines\" (as they may be called to distinguish them from the\r\n\"Huggins series\") can be induced to glimmer in vacuum-tubes. They seem\r\nto characterise bodies in a primitive state,[1424] and are in many cases\r\nassociated with absorption rays of oxygen, the identification of which\r\nby Mr. McClean in 1897[1425] was fully confirmed by Sir David\r\nGill.[1426] The typical \"oxygen star\" is Beta Crucis, one of the\r\nbrilliants of the Southern Cross; but the distinctive notes of its\r\nspectrum occur in not a few specimens of the helium class. Thus, Sir\r\nWilliam and Lady Huggins photographed several ultra-violet oxygen lines\r\nin Beta Lyræ,[1427] and found in Rigel signs of the presence of\r\nnitrogen,[1428] which, as well as silicium, proves to be a tolerably\r\nfrequent constituent of such orbs.[1429] For some unknown reason,\r\nmetalloids tend to become effaced, as metals, in the normal course of\r\nstellar development, exert a more and more conspicuous action.\r\n\r\nDr. Scheiner's spectrographic researches at Potsdam in 1890 and\r\nsubsequently, exemplify the immense advantages of self-registration. In\r\na restricted section of the spectrum of Capella, he was enabled to\r\ndetermine nearly three hundred lines with more precision than had then\r\nbeen attained in the measurement of terrestrial spectra. This star\r\nappeared to be virtually identical with the sun in physical\r\nconstitution, although it emits, according to the best available data,\r\nabout 140 times as much light, and is hence presumably 1,600 times more\r\nvoluminous. An equally close examination of the spectrum of Betelgeux\r\nshowed the predominance in it of the linear absorption of iron;[1430]\r\nbut its characteristic flutings do not extend to the photographic\r\nregion. Spectra of the second and third orders are for this reason not\r\neasily distinguished on the sensitive plate.\r\n\r\nA spectrographic investigation of all the brighter northern stars was\r\nset on foot in 1886 at the observatory of Harvard College, under the\r\nform of a memorial to Dr. H. Draper, whose promising work in that line\r\nwas brought to a close by his premature death in 1882. No individual\r\nexertions could, however, have realized a tithe of what has been and is\r\nbeing accomplished under Professor Pickering's able direction, with the\r\naid of the Draper and other instruments, supplemented by Mrs. Draper's\r\nliberal provision of funds. A novel system was adopted, or, rather, an\r\nold one--originally used by Fraunhofer--was revived.[1431] The use of a\r\nslit was discarded as unnecessary for objects like the stars, devoid of\r\nsensible dimensions, and giving hence a _naturally_ pure spectrum; and a\r\nlarge prism, placed in front of the object-glass, analysed at once, with\r\nslight loss of light, the rays of all the stars in the field. Their\r\nspectra were taken, as it were, wholesale. As many as two hundred stars\r\ndown to the eighth magnitude were occasionally printed on a single plate\r\nwith a single exposure. No cylindrical lens was employed. The movement\r\nof the stars themselves was turned to account for giving the desirable\r\nwidth to their spectra. The star was allowed--by disconnecting or\r\nsuitably regulating the clock--to travel slowly across the line of its\r\nown dispersed light, so broadening it gradually into a band. Excellent\r\nresults were secured in this way. About fifty lines appear in the\r\nphotographed spectrum of Aldebaran, and eight in that of Vega. On\r\nJanuary 26, 1886, with an exposure of thirty-four minutes, a\r\nsimultaneous impression was obtained of the spectra (among many others)\r\nof close upon forty Pleiades. With few and doubtful exceptions, they all\r\nproved to belong to the same type. An additional argument for the common\r\norigin of the stars forming this beautiful group was thus\r\nprovided.[1432]\r\n\r\nThe \"Draper Catalogue\" of stellar spectra was published in 1890.[1433]\r\nIt gives the results of a rapid analytical survey of the heavens north\r\nof 25° of southern declination, and includes 10,351 stars, down to about\r\nthe eighth magnitude. The telescope used was of eight inches aperture\r\nand forty-five focus, its field of view--owing to the \"portrait-lens\" or\r\n\"doublet\" form given to it--embracing with fair definition no less than\r\none hundred square degrees. An objective prism eight inches square was\r\nattached, and exposures of a few minutes were given to the most\r\nsensitive plates that could be procured. In this way the sky was twice\r\ncovered in duplicate, each star appearing, as a rule, on four plates.\r\nThe registration of their spectra was sought to be made more distinctive\r\nthan had previously been attempted, Secchi's first type being divided\r\ninto four, his second into five subdivisions; but the differences\r\nregarded in them could be confidently established only for stars above\r\nthe sixth magnitude. The work supplies none the less valuable materials\r\nfor general inferences as to the distribution and relations of the\r\nspectral types. The labour of its actual preparation was borne by a\r\nstaff of ladies under the direction of Mrs. Fleming. Materials for its\r\ncompletion to the southern pole have been accumulated with the identical\r\ninstrument used at Cambridge, transferred for the purpose in 1889 to\r\nPeru, and the forthcoming \"Second Draper Catalogue\" will comprise 30,000\r\nstars in both hemispheres. As supplements to this great enterprise, two\r\nimportant detailed discussions of stellar spectra were issued in 1897\r\nand 1901 respectively.[1434] The first, by Miss A. C. Maury, dealt with\r\n681 bright stars visible in the northern hemisphere; the second, by Miss\r\nA. J. Cannon, with 1,122 southern stars. Both authors traced, with care\r\nand ability, the minute gradations by which the long process of stellar\r\nevolution appears to be accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the Draper Memorial researches was marked by discoveries\r\nof an unexampled kind.\r\n\r\nThe principle upon which \"motion in the line of sight\" can be detected\r\nand measured with the spectroscope has already been explained.[1435] It\r\ndepends, as our readers will remember, upon the removal of certain\r\nlines, dark or bright (it matters not which), from their normal places\r\nby almost infinitesimal amounts. The whole spectrum of the moving\r\nobject, in fact, is very slightly _shoved_ hither or thither, according\r\nas it is travelling towards or from the eye; but, for convenience of\r\nmeasurement, one line is usually picked out from the rest, and attention\r\nconcentrated upon it. The application of this method to the stars,\r\nhowever, is encompassed with difficulties. It needs a powerfully\r\ndispersive spectroscope to show line-displacements of the minute order\r\nin question; and powerful dispersion involves a strictly proportionate\r\nenfeeblement of light. This, where the supply is already to a deplorable\r\nextent niggardly, can ill be afforded; for which reason the operation of\r\ndetermining a star's approach or recession is, even apart from\r\natmospheric obstacles, an excessively delicate one.\r\n\r\nIt was first executed by Sir William Huggins early in 1868.[1436]\r\nSelecting the brightest star in the heavens as the most promising\r\nsubject of experiment, he considered the F line in the spectrum of\r\nSirius to be just so much displaced towards the red as to indicate (the\r\norbital motion of the earth being deducted) recession at the rate of\r\ntwenty-nine miles a second; and the reality and direction of the\r\nmovement were ratified by Vogel and Lohse's observation, March 22, 1871,\r\nof a similar, but even more considerable displacement.[1437] The inquiry\r\nwas resumed by Huggins with improved apparatus in the following year,\r\nwhen the velocities of thirty stars were approximately determined.[1438]\r\nThe retreat of Sirius, which proved slower than had at first been\r\nsupposed, was now announced to be shared, at rates varying from twelve\r\nto twenty-nine miles, by Betelgeux, Rigel, Castor, Regulus, and five of\r\nthe principal stars in the Plough. Arcturus, on the contrary, gave signs\r\nof rapid approach, as well as Pollux, Vega, Deneb in the Swan, and the\r\nbrightness of the Pointers.\r\n\r\nNumerically, indeed, these results were encompassed with uncertainty.\r\nThus, Arcturus is now fully ascertained to be travelling towards the sun\r\nat the comparatively slow pace of less than five miles a second; and\r\nSirius moves twice as fast in the same direction. The great difficulty\r\nof measuring so distended a line as the Sirian F might, indeed, well\r\naccount for some apparent anomalies. The scope of Sir William Huggins's\r\nachievement was not, however, to provide definitive data, but to\r\nestablish as practicable the method of procuring them. In this he was\r\nthoroughly successful, and his success was of incalculable value.\r\nSpectroscopic investigations of stellar movements may confidently be\r\nexpected to play a leading part in the unravelment of the vast and\r\ncomplex relations which we can dimly detect as prevailing among the\r\ninnumerable orbs of the sidereal world; for it supplements the means\r\nwhich we possess of measuring by direct observation movements transverse\r\nto the line of sight, and thus completes our knowledge of the courses\r\nand velocities of stars at ascertained distances, while supplying for\r\nall a valuable index to the amount of perspective foreshortening of\r\napparent movement. Thus some, even if an imperfect, knowledge may at\r\nlength be gained of the revolutions of the stars--of the systems they\r\nunite to form, of the paths they respectively pursue, and of the forces\r\nunder the compulsion of which they travel.\r\n\r\nThe applicability of the method to determining the orbital motions of\r\ndouble stars was pointed out by Fox Talbot in 1871;[1439] but its use\r\nfor their discovery revealed itself spontaneously through the Harvard\r\nCollege photographs. In \"spectrograms\" of Zeta Ursæ Majoris\r\n(Mizar), taken in 1887, and again in 1889, the K line was seen to be\r\ndouble; while on other plates it appeared single. A careful study of\r\nMiss A. C. Maury of a series of seventy impressions indicated for the\r\ndoubling a period of fifty-two days, and showed it to affect all the\r\nlines in the spectrum.[1440] The only available, and no doubt the true,\r\nexplanation of the phenomenon was that two similar and nearly equal\r\nstars are here merged into one telescopically indivisible; their\r\ncombined light giving a single or double spectrum, according as their\r\norbital velocities are directed across or along our line of sight. The\r\nmovements of a revolving pair of stars must always be opposite in sense,\r\nand proportionately equal in amount. That is, they at all times travel\r\nwith speeds in the inverse ratio of their masses. Hence, unless the\r\nplane of their orbits be perpendicular to a plane passing through the\r\neye, there must be two opposite points where their velocities in the\r\nline of sight reach a maximum, and two diametrically opposite points\r\nwhere they touch zero. The lines in their common spectrum would thus\r\nappear alternately double and single twice in the course of each\r\nrevolution. To that of Mizar, at first supposed to need 104 days for its\r\ncompletion, a period of only twenty days fourteen hours was finally\r\nassigned by Vogel.[1441] Anomalous spectral effects, probably due to the\r\nvery considerable eccentricity of the orbit, long impeded its\r\nsatisfactory determination. The mean distance apart of the component\r\nstars, as now ascertained, is just twenty-two million miles, and their\r\njoint mass quadruples that of the sun. But these are minimum estimates.\r\nFor if the orbital plane be inclined, much or little, to the line of\r\nsight, the dimensions and mass of the system should be proportionately\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nAn analogous discovery was made by Miss Maury in 1889. But in the\r\nspectrum of Beta Aurigæ, the lines open out and close up on\r\nalternate days, indicating a relative orbit[1442] with a radius of less\r\nthan eight million miles, traversed in about four days. This implies a\r\nrate of travel for each star of sixty-five miles a second, and a\r\ncombined mass 4·7 times that of the sun. The components are\r\napproximately equal, both in mass and light,[1443] and the system formed\r\nby them is transported towards us with a speed of some sixteen miles a\r\nsecond. The line-shiftings so singularly communicative proceed, in this\r\nstar, with perfect regularity.\r\n\r\nThis new class of \"spectroscopic binaries\" could never have been\r\nvisually disclosed. The distance of Beta Aurigæ from the earth, as\r\ndetermined, somewhat doubtfully, by Professor Pritchard, is nearly three\r\nand a third million times that of the earth from the sun (parallax =\r\n0·06\"); whence it has been calculated that the greatest angular\r\nseparation of the revolving stars is only five-thousandths of a second\r\nof arc.[1444] To make this evanescent interval perceptible, a telescope\r\neighty feet in aperture would be required.\r\n\r\nThe zodiacal star, Spica (Alpha Virginis), was announced by Dr.\r\nVogel, April 24, 1890,[1445] to belong to the novel category, with the\r\ndifference, however, of possessing a nearly dark, instead of a\r\nbrilliantly lustrous companion. In this case, accordingly, the tell-tale\r\nspectroscopic variations consist merely in a slight swinging to and fro\r\nof single lines. No second spectrum leaves a legible trace on the plate.\r\nSpica revolves in four days at the rate of fifty-seven miles a\r\nsecond,[1446] or quicker, in proportion as its orbit is more inclined to\r\nthe line of sight, round a centre at a minimum distance of three\r\nmillions of miles. But the position of the second star being unknown,\r\nthe mass of the system remains indeterminate. The lesser component of\r\nthe splendid, slowly revolving binary, Castor, is also closely double.\r\nIts spectral lines were found by Bélopolsky in 1896[1447] to oscillate\r\nonce in nearly three days, the secondary globe being apparently quite\r\nobscure. Further study of the movements thus betrayed elicited the fact\r\nthat the major axis of the eclipse traversed revolves in a period of\r\n2,100 days, as a consequence, most likely, of the flattened shape of the\r\nstars.[1448] Still more unexpected was the simultaneous assignment, by\r\nCampbell and Newall, of a duplex character to Capella.[1449] Here both\r\ncomponents shine, though with a different quality of light, one giving a\r\npure solar spectrum, the other claiming prismatic affinity with Procyon.\r\nTheir mutual circulation is performed in 104 days, and the radius of\r\ntheir orbit cannot be less, and may be a great deal more, than\r\n51,000,000 miles. Hence the possibility is not excluded that the\r\nstar--which has an authentic parallax of 0·08\"--may be visually\r\nresolved. Indeed, signs of \"elongation\" were thought to be perceptible\r\nwith the Greenwich 28-inch refractor,[1450] while only round images\r\ncould be seen at Lick.[1451] Another noteworthy case is that of Polaris,\r\nfound by Campbell to have certainly one, and probably two obscure\r\nattendants.[1452] Through his systematic investigations of stellar\r\nradial velocities with the Mills spectrograph, knowledge in this\r\ndepartment has, since 1897, progressed so rapidly that the spectroscopic\r\nbinaries of our acquaintance already number half a hundred, and ten\r\ntimes as many more doubtless lie within easy range of detection.\r\n\r\nNow it is evident that a spectroscopic binary, if the plane of its\r\nmotion made a very small angle with the line of sight, would be a\r\nvariable star. For, during a few hours of each revolution, some at least\r\nof its light should be cut off by a transit of its dusky companion. Such\r\n\"eclipse-stars\" are actually found in the heavens.\r\n\r\nThe best and longest-known member of the group is Algol in the Head of\r\nMedusa, the \"Demon-star\" of the Arabs.[1453] This remarkable object,\r\nnormally above the third magnitude, loses and regains three-fifths of\r\nits light once in 68·8 hours, the change being completed in about twelve\r\nhours. Its definite and limited nature, and punctual recurrence,\r\nsuggested to Goodricke of York, by whom the periodicity of the star was\r\ndiscovered in 1783,[1454] the interposition of a large dark satellite.\r\nBut the conditions involved by the explanation were first seriously\r\ninvestigated by Pickering in 1880.[1455] He found that the phenomena\r\ncould be satisfactorily accounted for by supposing an obscure body 0·764\r\nthe bright star's diameter to revolve round it in a period identical\r\nwith that of its observed variation. This theoretical forecast was\r\nverified with singular exactitude at Potsdam in 1889.[1456] A series of\r\nspectral photographs taken there showed each of Algol's minima to be\r\npreceded by a rapid recession from the earth, and succeeded by a rapid\r\nmovement of approach towards it. They take place, accordingly, when the\r\nstar is at the furthest point from ourselves of an orbit described round\r\nan invisible companion, the transits of which across its disc betray\r\nthemselves to notice by the luminous vicissitudes they occasion. The\r\ndiameter of this orbit, traversed at the rate of twenty-six miles a\r\nsecond, is just 2,000,000 miles; and it is an easy further inference\r\nfrom the duration and extent of the phases exhibited that Algol itself\r\nmust be (in round numbers) one million, its attendant 830,000 miles in\r\ndiameter. Assuming both to be of the same density, Vogel found their\r\nrespective masses to be four-ninths and two-ninths that of the sun, and\r\ntheir distance asunder to be 3,230,000 miles.\r\n\r\nThis singularly assorted pair of stars possibly form part of a larger\r\nsystem. Their period of revolution is shorter now by six seconds than it\r\nwas in Goodricke's time; and Dr. Chandler has shown, by an exhaustive\r\ndiscussion, that its inequalities are comprised in a cycle of about 130\r\nyears.[1457] They arise, in his view, from a common revolution, in that\r\nperiod, of the close couple about a third distant body, emitting little\r\nor no light, in an orbit inclined 20° to our line of vision, and of\r\napproximately the size of that described by Uranus round the sun. The\r\ntime spent by light in crossing this orbit causes an apparent delay in\r\nthe phases of the variable, when Algol and its eclipsing satellite are\r\non its further side from ourselves, balanced by acceleration while they\r\ntraverse its hither side. Dr. Chandler derives confirmation for his\r\nplausible and ingenious theory from a supposed undulation in the line\r\ntraced out by Algol's small proper motion; but the reality of this\r\ndisturbance has yet to be established.[1458] Meanwhile, M.\r\nTisserand,[1459] late Director of the Paris Observatory, preferred to\r\naccount for Algol's inequalities on the principle later applied by\r\nBélopolsky to those of Castor. That is to say, he assumed a revolving\r\nline of apsides in an elliptical orbit traversed by a pretty strongly\r\ncompressed pair of globes. The truth of this hypothesis can be tested by\r\nclose observation of the phases of the star during the next few years.\r\n\r\nThe variable in the Head of Medusa is the exemplar of a class including\r\n26 recognised members, all of which doubtless represent occulting\r\ncombinations of stars. But their occultations result merely from the\r\naccident of their orbital planes passing through our line of sight;\r\nhence the heavens must contain numerous systems similarly constituted,\r\nthough otherwise situated as regards ourselves, some of which, like\r\nSpica Virginis, will become known through their spectroscopic changes,\r\nwhile others, because revolving in planes nearly tangent to the sphere,\r\nor at right angles to the visual line, may never disclose to us their\r\ntrue nature. Among eclipsing stars should probably be reckoned the\r\npeculiar variables, Beta Lyræ and V Puppis, each believed to\r\nconsist of a pair of bright stars revolving almost in contact.[1460]\r\nThree stars, on the other hand, distinguished by rapid and regular\r\nfluctuations, have been proved by Bélopolsky to be attended by\r\nnon-occulting satellites, which circulate, nevertheless, in the\r\nidentical periods of light-change.\r\n\r\nGore's \"Catalogue of Known Variables\"[1461] included, in 1884, 190\r\nentries, and the number was augmented to 243 on its revision in\r\n1888.[1462] Chandler's first list of 225 such objects,[1463] published\r\nabout the same time, received successive expansions in 1893 and\r\n1896,[1464] and finally included 400 entries. A new \"Catalogue of\r\nVariable Stars,\" still wider in scope, will shortly be issued by the\r\nGerman _Astronomische Gesellschaft_. Mr. A. W. Roberts's researches on\r\nsouthern variables[1465] have greatly helped to give precision, while\r\nadding to the extent of knowledge in this branch. Dr. Gould held the\r\nopinion that most stars fluctuate slightly in brightness through\r\nsurface-alterations similar to, but on a larger scale than those of the\r\nsun; and the solar analogy might be pushed somewhat further. It perhaps\r\naffords a clue to much that is perplexing in stellar behaviour. Wolf\r\npointed out in 1852 the striking resemblance in character between curves\r\nrepresenting sun-spot frequency and curves representing the changing\r\nluminous intensity of many variable stars. There were the same steep\r\nascent to maximum and more gradual decline to minimum, the same\r\nirregularities in heights and hollows, and, it may be added, the same\r\ntendency to a double maximum, and complexity of superposed\r\nperiods.[1466] It is impossible to compare the two sets of phenomena\r\nthus graphically portrayed without reaching the conclusion that they are\r\nof closely related origin. But the correspondence indicated is not, as\r\nhas often been hastily assumed, between maxima of sun-spots and minima\r\nof stellar brightness, but just the reverse. The luminous outbursts, not\r\nthe obscurations of variable stars, obey a law analogous to that\r\ngoverning the development of spots on the sun. Objects of the kind do\r\nnot, then, gain light through the closing-up of dusky chasms in their\r\nphotospheres, but by an actual increase of surface-brilliancy, together\r\nwith an immense growth of these brilliant formations--prominences and\r\nfaculæ--which, in the sun, accompany, or are appended to spots. A\r\ncomparison of light-curves with curves of spot-frequency leaves no doubt\r\non this point, and the strongest corroborative evidence is derived from\r\nthe emergence of bright lines in the spectra of long-period variables\r\nrising to their recurring maxima.\r\n\r\nEvery kind and degree of variability is exemplified in the heavens. At\r\nthe bottom of the scales are stars like the sun, of which the lustre\r\nis--tried by our instrumental means--sensibly steady. At the other\r\nextreme are ranged the astounding apparitions of \"new,\" or \"temporary\"\r\nstars. Within the last thirty-six years eleven of these stellar guests\r\n(as the Chinese call them) have presented themselves, and we meet with a\r\ntwelfth no farther back than April 27, 1848. But of the \"new star\" in\r\nOphiuchus found by Mr. Hind on that night, little more could be learnt\r\nthan of the brilliant objects of the same kind observed by Tycho and\r\nKepler. The spectroscope had not then been invented. Let us hear what it\r\nhad to tell of later arrivals.\r\n\r\nAbout thirty minutes before midnight of May 12, 1866, Mr. John\r\nBirmingham of Millbrook, near Tuam, in Ireland, saw with astonishment a\r\nbright star of the second magnitude unfamiliarly situated in the\r\nconstellation of the Northern Crown. Four hours earlier, Schmidt of\r\nAthens had been surveying the same part of the heavens, and was able to\r\ntestify that it was not visible there. That is to say, a few hours, or\r\npossibly a few minutes, sufficed to bring about a conflagration, the\r\nnews of which may have occupied hundreds of years in travelling to us\r\nacross space. The rays which were its messengers, admitted within the\r\nslit of Sir William Huggins's spectroscope, May 16, proved to be of a\r\ncomposition highly significant as to the nature of the catastrophe. The\r\nstar--which had already declined below the third magnitude--showed what\r\nwas described as a double spectrum. To the dusky flutings of Secchi's\r\nthird type four brilliant rays were added.[1467] The chief of these\r\nagreed in position with lines of hydrogen; so that the immediate cause\r\nof the outburst was inferred to have been the eruption, or ignition, of\r\nvast masses of that subtle kind of matter, the universal importance of\r\nwhich throughout the cosmos is one of the most curious facts revealed by\r\nthe spectroscope.\r\n\r\nT Coronæ (as the new star was called) quickly lost its adventitious\r\nsplendour. Nine days after its discovery it was again invisible to the\r\nnaked eye. It is now a pale yellow, slightly variable star near the\r\ntenth magnitude, and finds a place as such in Argelander's charts.[1468]\r\nIt was thus obscurely known before it made its sudden leap into\r\nnotoriety.\r\n\r\nThe next \"temporary,\" discovered by Dr. Schmidt at Athens, November 24,\r\n1876, could lay no claim to previous recognition even in that modest\r\nrank. It was strictly a parvenu. There was no record of its existence\r\nuntil it made its appearance as a star of nearly the third magnitude, in\r\nthe constellation of the Swan. Its spectrum was examined, December 2, by\r\nCornu at Paris,[1469] and a few days later by Vogel and O. Lohse at\r\nPotsdam.[1470] It proved of a closely similar character to that of T\r\nCoronæ. A range of bright lines, including those of hydrogen, and\r\nprobably of helium, stood out from a continuous background impressed\r\nwith strong absorption. It may be presumed that in reality the gaseous\r\nsubstances, which, by their sudden incandescence, had produced the\r\napparent conflagration, lay comparatively near the surface of the star,\r\nwhile the screen of cooler materials intercepting large portions of its\r\nlight was situated at a considerable elevation in its atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe object, meanwhile, steadily faded. By the end of the year it was of\r\nno more than seventh magnitude. After the second week of March, 1877,\r\nstrengthening twilight combined with the decline of its radiance to\r\narrest further observation. It was resumed, September 2, at Dunecht,\r\nwith a strange result. Practically the whole of its scanty light (it had\r\nthen sunk below the tenth magnitude) was perceived to be gathered into a\r\nsingle bright line in the green, and that the most characteristic line\r\nof gaseous nebulæ.[1471] The star had, in fact, so far as outward\r\nappearance was concerned, become transformed into a planetary nebula,\r\nmany of which are so minute as to be distinguishable from small stars\r\nonly by the quality of their radiations. It is now, having sunk to about\r\nthe fourteenth magnitude,[1472] entirely beyond the reach of\r\nspectroscopic scrutiny.\r\n\r\nPerhaps none of the marvellous changes witnessed in the heavens has\r\ngiven a more significant hint as to their construction than the stellar\r\nblaze kindled in the heart of the great Andromeda nebula some\r\nundetermined number of years or centuries before its rays reached the\r\nearth in the month of August, 1885. The first published discovery was by\r\nDr. Hartwig at Dorpat on August 31; but it was found to have been\r\nalready seen, on the 19th, by Mr. Isaac W. Ward of Belfast, and on the\r\n17th by M. Ludovic Gully of Rouen. The _negative_ observations, on the\r\n16th, of Tempel[1473] and Max Wolf, limited very narrowly the epoch of\r\nthe apparition. Nevertheless, it did not, like most temporaries, attain\r\nits maximum brightness all at once. When first detected, it was of the\r\nninth, by September 1 it had risen to the seventh magnitude, from which\r\nit so rapidly fell off that in March it touched the limit of visibility\r\n(sixteenth magnitude) with the Washington 26-inch. Its light bleached\r\nvery perceptibly as it faded.[1474] During the earlier stages of its\r\ndecline, the contrast was striking between the sharply defined, ruddy\r\ndisc of the star, and the hazy, greenish-white background upon which it\r\nwas projected,[1475] and with which it was inevitably suggested to be in\r\nsome sort of physical connection.\r\n\r\nLet us consider what evidence was really available on this point. To\r\nbegin with, the position of the star was not exactly central. It lay\r\nsixteen seconds of arc to the south-west of the true nebular nucleus.\r\nIts appearance did not then signify a sudden advance of the nebula\r\ntowards condensation, nor was it attended by any visible change in it\r\nsave the transient effect of partial effacement through superior\r\nbrightness.\r\n\r\nEqually indecisive information was derived from the spectroscope. To\r\nVogel, Hasselberg, and Young, the light of the \"Nova\" seemed perfectly\r\ncontinuous; but Huggins caught traces of bright lines on September 2,\r\nconfirmed on the 9th;[1476] and Copeland succeeded, on September 30, in\r\nmeasuring three bright bands with an acute-angled prism specially\r\nconstructed for the purpose.[1477] A shimmer of F was suspected, and had\r\nalso been perceived by Mr. O. T. Sherman of Yale College. Still, the\r\neffect was widely different from that of the characteristic blazing\r\nspectrum of a temporary star, and prompted the surmise that here, too, a\r\nvariable might be under scrutiny. The star, however, was certainly so\r\nfar \"new\" that its rays, until their sudden accession of strength, were\r\ntoo feeble to affect even our reinforced senses. Not one of the 1,283\r\nsmall stars recorded in charts of the nebula could be identified with\r\nit; and a photograph taken by Dr. Common, August 16, 1884, on which a\r\nmultitude of stars down to the fifteenth magnitude had imprinted\r\nthemselves, showed the uniform, soft gradation of nebulous light to be\r\nabsolutely unbroken by a stellar indication in the spot reserved for the\r\nfuture occupation of the \"Nova.\"[1478]\r\n\r\nSo far, then, the view that its relation to the nebula was a merely\r\noptical one might be justified; but it became altogether untenable when\r\nit was found that what was taken to be a chance coincidence had repeated\r\nitself within living memory. On the 21st of May, 1860, M. Auwers\r\nperceived at Königsberg a seventh magnitude star shining close to the\r\ncentre of a nebula in Scorpio, numbered 80 in Messier's Catalogue.[1479]\r\nThree days earlier it certainly was not there, and three weeks later it\r\nhad vanished. The effect to Mr. Pogson (who independently discovered the\r\nchange, May 28)[1480] was as if the nebula had been _replaced_ by a\r\nstar, so entirely were its dim rays overpowered by the concentrated\r\nblaze in their midst. Now, it is simply incredible that two outbursts of\r\nso uncommon a character should have _accidentally_ occurred just on the\r\nline of sight between us and the central portions of two nebulæ; we\r\nmust, then, conclude that they showed _on_ these objects because they\r\ntook place _in_ them. The most favoured explanation is that they were\r\nwhat might be called effects of overcrowding--that some of the numerous\r\nsmall bodies, presumably composing the nebulæ, jostled together, in\r\ntheir intricate circlings, and obtained compensation in heat for their\r\nsacrifice of motion. But this is scarcely more than a plausible\r\nmakeshift of perplexed thought. Mr. W. H. S. Monck, on the other hand,\r\nhas suggested that new stars appear when dark bodies are rendered\r\nluminous by rushing through the gaseous fields of space,[1481] just as\r\nmeteors kindle in our atmosphere. The idea, which has been revived and\r\nelaborated by Dr. Seeliger of Munich,[1482] is ingenious, but was not\r\ndesigned to apply to our present case. Neither of the objects\r\ndistinguished by the striking variations just described is of gaseous\r\nconstitution. That in Scorpio appears under high magnifying powers as a\r\n\"compressed cluster\"; that in Andromeda is perhaps, as Sir J. Herschel\r\nsuggested, \"optically nebulous through the smallness of its constituent\r\nstars\"[1483]--if stars they deserve to be called.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of December, 1891, Dr. Max Wolf took a photograph of the\r\nregion about Chi Aurigæ. No stranger so bright as the eighth\r\nmagnitude was among the stars depicted upon it. On the 10th,\r\nnevertheless, a stellar object of the fifth magnitude, situated a couple\r\nof degrees to the north-east of Beta Tauri and previously\r\nunrecorded, where eleventh magnitude stars appeared, imprinted itself\r\nupon a Harvard negative. Subsequent photographs taken at the same place\r\nshowed it to have gained about half a magnitude by the 20th; but the\r\nplates were not then examined, and the discovery was left to be modestly\r\nappropriated by an amateur, the Rev. Dr. Anderson of Edinburgh, by whom\r\nit was announced, February 1, 1892, through the medium of an anonymous\r\npostcard, to Dr. Copeland, the Astronomer Royal for Scotland.[1484] By\r\nhim and others, the engines of modern research were promptly set to\r\nwork. And to good purpose. Nova Aurigæ was the first star of its kind\r\nstudied by the universal chemical method. It is the first, accordingly,\r\nof which authentic records can be handed down to posterity. They are of\r\na most remarkable character. The spectrum of the new object was\r\nphotographed at Stonyhurst and South Kensington on February 3; a few\r\ndays later, at Harvard and Lick in America, at Potsdam and Hérény on the\r\nContinent of Europe. But by far the most complete impression was\r\nsecured, February 22, with an exposure of an hour and three-quarters, by\r\nSir William and Lady Huggins, through whose kindness it is reproduced in\r\nPlate V., Fig. 1. The range of bright lines displayed in it is of\r\nastonishing vividness and extent. It includes all the hydrogen rays dark\r\nin the spectrum of Sirius (separately printed for comparison), besides\r\nmany others still more refrangible, as yet unidentified. Very\r\nsignificant, too, is the marked character of the great prominence lines\r\nH and K. The visual spectrum of the Nova was splendidly effective.\r\nA quartette of brilliant green rays, two of them due to helium,\r\ncaught the eye; and they had companions too numerous to be easily\r\ncounted. The hydrogen lines were broad and bright; C blazed, as Mr.\r\nEspin said, \"like a danger-signal on a dark night\"; the sodium pair were\r\nidentified at Tulse Hill, and the yellow helium ray was suspected to\r\nlurk close beside them. Fig. 2 in the same plate shows the spectrum as\r\nit was seen and mapped by Lady Huggins, February 2 to 6, together with\r\nthe spectra employed to test the nature of the emissions dispersed in\r\nit. One striking feature will be at once remarked. It is that of the\r\npairing of bright with dark lines. Both in the visible and the\r\nphotographic regions this singular peculiarity was unmistakable; and\r\nsince the two series plainly owned the same chemical origin, their\r\nseparate visibility implied large displacement. Otherwise they would\r\nhave been superposed, not juxtaposed. Measurements of the bright rays,\r\naccordingly, showed them to be considerably pushed down towards the red,\r\nwhile their dark companions were still more pushed up towards the blue\r\nend. Thus the spectrum of Nova Aurigæ, like that of Beta Lyræ,\r\nwith which it had many points in common, appeared to be really double.\r\nIt was supposed to combine the light of two distinct bodies, one, of a\r\ngaseous nature, moving rapidly away from the earth, the other, giving a\r\nmore sunlike spectrum, approaching it with even higher speed. The\r\nrelative velocity determined at Potsdam for these oppositely flying\r\nmasses amounted to 550 miles a second.[1485] And this prodigious rate of\r\nseparation was fully maintained during six weeks! It did not then\r\nrepresent a mere periastral rush-past.[1486] To the bodies exhibiting\r\nits effects, and parting company for ever under its stress, it must have\r\nbelonged, with slight diminution, in perpetuity. The luminous outburst\r\nby which they became visible was explained by Sir William Huggins, in a\r\nlecture delivered at the Royal Institution, May 13, 1892, on the tidal\r\ntheory of Klinkerfues and Wilsing. Disturbances and deformations due to\r\nthe mutual attraction of two bulky globes at a close approach would, he\r\nconsidered, \"give rise to enormous eruptions of the hotter matters from\r\nwithin, immensely greater, but similar in kind, to solar eruptions; and\r\naccompanied, probably, by large electrical disturbances.\" The multiple\r\naspect and somewhat variable character of both bright and dark lines\r\nwere plausibly referred to processes of \"reversal,\" such as are nearly\r\nalways in progress above sun-spots; but the long duration of the star's\r\nsuddenly acquired lustre did not easily fit in with the adopted\r\nrationale. A direct collision, on the other hand, was out of the\r\nquestion, since there had obviously been little, if any, sacrifice of\r\nmotion; and the substitution of a nebula for one of the \"stars\"[1487]\r\ncompelled recourse to scarcely conceivable modes of action for an\r\nexplanation of the perplexing peculiarities of the compound spectrum.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE V.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photographic and Visual Spectrum of Nova Aurigæ.\r\n\r\nFig. 1.--From a Photograph taken by Sir William and Lady Huggins, Feb.\r\n22, 1892.\r\n\r\nFig. 2.--From a Drawing made by Lady Huggins, Feb. 2 to 6, 1892.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAn unexpected _dénouement_, however, threw all speculations off the\r\ntrack. The Nova contained most of its brightness, fluctuations\r\nnotwithstanding, until March 9; after which date it ran swiftly and\r\nuniformly down towards what was apprehended to be total extinction. No\r\nmarked change of spectrum attended its decline. When last examined at\r\nTulse Hill, March 24, all the more essential features of its prismatic\r\nlight were still faintly recognisable.[1488] The object was steadily\r\nsinking on April 26, when a (supposed) final glimpse of it was caught\r\nwith the Lick 36-inch.[1489] It was then of about the sixteenth\r\nmagnitude. But on August 17 it had sprung up to the tenth, as Professors\r\nHolden, Schaeberle, and Campbell perceived with amazement on turning the\r\nsame instrument upon its place. And to Professor Barnard it appeared,\r\ntwo nights later, not only revived, but transformed into the nucleus of\r\na planetary nebula, 3\" across.[1490] The reality of this seeming\r\ndistension, however, at once disputed, was eventually disproved. It\r\nunquestionably arose from the imperfect focussing power of the telescope\r\nfor rays of unusual quality.[1491]\r\n\r\nThe rekindled Nova was detected in this country by Mr. H. Corder, on\r\nwhose notification Mr. Espin, on August 21, examined its nearly\r\nmonochromatic spectrum.[1492] The metamorphosis of Nova Cygni seemed\r\nrepeated.[1493] The light of the new object, like that of its\r\npredecessor, was mainly concentrated in a vivid green band, identified\r\nwith the chief nebular line by Copeland,[1494] Von Gothard,[1495] and\r\nCampbell.[1496] The second nebular line was also represented. Indeed,\r\nthe last-named observer recognised nearly all the eighteen lines\r\nmeasured by him in the Nova as characteristic of planetary nebulæ.[1497]\r\nOf particular interest is the emergence in the star-spectrum\r\nphotographed by Von Gothard of an ultra-violet line originally\r\ndiscovered at Tulse Hill in the Orion nebula, which is also very strong\r\nin the Lyra annular nebula.\r\n\r\nObviously, then, the physical constitution of Nova Aurigæ became\r\nprofoundly modified during the four months of its invisibility. The\r\nspectrum of February was or appeared compound; that of August was\r\nsimple; it could be reasonably associated only with a single\r\nlight-source. Many of the former brilliant lines, too, had vanished, and\r\nbeen replaced by others, at first inconspicuous or absent. As a result,\r\nthe solar-prominence type, to which the earlier spectrum had seemed to\r\nconform, was completely effaced in the later. The cause of these\r\nalterations remains mysterious, yet its effects continue. The chromatic\r\nbehaviour of the semi-extinct Nova, when scrutinised with great\r\nrefractors, shows its waning light to be distinctly nebular.[1498] Like\r\nnearly all its congeners, the star is situated in the full stream of the\r\nMilky Way, and we learn without surprise that micrometrical measures by\r\nBurnham and Barnard[1499] failed to elicit from it any sign of\r\nparallactic shifting. It is hence certain that the development of light,\r\nof which the news reached the earth in December, 1891, must have been on\r\na vast scale, and of ancient date. Nova Aurigæ at its maximum assuredly\r\nexceeded the sun many times in brightness; and its conflagration can\r\nscarcely have occurred less, and may have occurred much more, than a\r\nhundred years ago.\r\n\r\nBy means of the photographic surveys of the skies, carried on in both\r\nhemispheres under Professor Pickering's superintendence, such amazing\r\nevents have been proved to be of not infrequent occurrence. Within six\r\nyears five new stars were detected from Draper Memorial, or chart-plates\r\nby Mrs Fleming, besides the retrospective discovery of a sixth which had\r\nrapidly burnt itself out, eight years previously, in Perseus.[1500] Nova\r\nNormæ was the immediate successor of Nova Aurigæ; Nova Carinæ and Nova\r\nCentauri lit up in 1895, the latter in a pre-existent nebula; Nova\r\nSagittarii and Nova Aquilæ attained brief maxima in 1898 and 1899\r\nrespectively. Now, three out of these five stars reproduced with\r\nsingular fidelity the spectrum of Nova Aurigæ; they displayed the same\r\nbrilliant rays shadowed, invariably on their blue sides, by dark ones.\r\nPalpably, then, the arrangement was systematic and significant; it could\r\nnot result merely from the casually directed, opposite velocities of\r\nbodies meeting in space. The hypothesis of stellar encounters\r\naccordingly fell to the ground, and has been provided with no entire\r\nsatisfactory substitute. Most speculators now fully recognise that\r\nmotion-displacements cannot be made to account for the doubled spectra\r\nof Novæ, and seek recourse instead to some kind of physical agency for\r\nproducing the observed effect.[1501] And since this is also visible in\r\ncertain permanent, though peculiar objects--notably in P Cygni,\r\nBeta Lyræ, and Eta Carinæ--the acting cause must also evidently be\r\npermanent and inherent.\r\n\r\nThe \"new star of the new century\"[1502] was a visual discovery. Dr.\r\nAnderson duplicated, with added _éclat_, his performance of nine years\r\nback. In the early morning of February 22, 1901, he perceived that Algol\r\nhad a neighbour of nearly its own brightness, which a photograph taken\r\nby Mr. Stanley Williams, at Brighton, proved to have risen from below\r\nthe twelfth magnitude within the preceding 28 hours. And it was still\r\nswiftly ascending. On the 23rd, it outshone Capella; for a brief space\r\nit took rank as the premier star of the northern hemisphere. A decline\r\nset in promptly, but was pursued hesitatingly. The light fluctuated\r\ncontinually over a range of a couple of magnitudes, and with a close\r\napproach, during some weeks, to a three-day periodicity. A year after\r\nthe original outburst, the star was still conspicuous with an\r\nopera-glass. The spectrum underwent amazing changes. At first\r\ncontinuous, save for fine dark lines of hydrogen and helium, it unfolded\r\nwithin forty-eight hours a composite range of brilliant and dusky bands\r\ndisposed in the usual fashion of Novæ. These lasted until far on in\r\nMarch, when hydrogen certainly, and probably other substances as well,\r\nceased to exert any appreciable absorptive action. Blue emissions of the\r\nWolf-Rayet type then became occasionally prominent, in remarkable\r\ncorrespondence with the varying lustre of the star;[1503] finally, a\r\nband at Lambda 3969, found by Wright at Lick to characterise nebular\r\nspectra,[1504] assumed abnormal importance; and in July the nebular\r\ntransformation might be said to be complete. Striking alterations of\r\ncolour attended these spectral vicissitudes. White to begin with, the\r\nstar soon turned deep red, and its redness was visibly intensified at\r\neach of its recurring minima of light. Blanching, however, ensued upon\r\nthe development of its nebulous proclivities; and its surviving rays are\r\nof a steely hue.\r\n\r\nAll the more important investigations of Nova Persei were conducted by\r\nphotographic means. Libraries of spectral plates were collected at the\r\nYerkes and Lick Observatories, at South Kensington, Stonyhurst, and\r\nPotsdam, and await the more exhaustive interpretation of the future.\r\nMeanwhile, extraordinary revelations have been supplied by immediate\r\nphotographic delineation. On August 22 and 23, 1901, Professor Max Wolf,\r\nby long exposures with the 16-inch Bruce twin objectives of the\r\nKönigstuhl Observatory (Heidelberg), obtained indications of a large\r\nnebula finely ramified, extending south-east of the Nova;[1505] and the\r\nentire formation came out in four hours with the Yerkes 2-foot\r\nreflector, directed to it by Mr. Ritchey on September 20.[1506] It\r\nproved to be a great spiral encircling, and apparently emanating from,\r\nthe star. But if so, tumultuously, and under stress of catastrophic\r\nimpulsions. A picture obtained by Mr. Perrine with the Crossley\r\nrefractor, in 7h. 19m., on November 7 and 8, disclosed the progress of a\r\nstartling change.[1507] Comparison with the Yerkes photograph showed\r\nthat during the intervening 48 days four clearly identifiable\r\ncondensations had become displaced, all to the same extent of about 90\r\nseconds of arc, and in fairly concordant directions, suggesting motion\r\n_round_ the Nova as well as away from it. The velocity implied, however,\r\nis so prodigious as virtually to exclude the supposition of a bodily\r\ntransport of matter. It should be at the rate of no less than twenty\r\nthousand miles a second, admitting the object to be at a distance from\r\nus corresponding to an annual parallax of one-tenth of a second, and\r\nactual measurements show it to be indefinitely more remote. The fact of\r\nrapid variations in the nebula was reaffirmed, though with less\r\nprecision, from Yerkes photographs of November 9 and 13, Mr. Ritchey\r\ninferring a general expansion of its southern portions.[1508] Much\r\nfurther evidence must be at hand before a sane judgment can be formed as\r\nto the nature of the strange events taking place in that secluded corner\r\nof the Galaxy.[1509] And it is highly probable that the illumination of\r\nthe nebulous wreaths round the star will prove no less evanescent than\r\nthe blazing of the star itself.\r\n\r\nWe have been compelled somewhat to anticipate our narrative as regards\r\ninquiries into the nature of nebulæ. The excursions of opinion on the\r\npoint were abruptly restricted and defined by the application to them of\r\nthe spectroscope. On August 29, 1864, Sir William Huggins sifted through\r\nhis prisms the rays of a bright planetary nebula in Draco.[1510] To his\r\ninfinite surprise, they proved to be mainly of one colour. In other\r\nwords, they avowed their origin from a mass of glowing vapour. As to\r\nwhat _kind_ of vapour it might be by which Herschel's conjecture of a\r\n\"shining fluid\" diffused at large throughout the cosmos was thus\r\nunexpectedly verified, an answer only partially satisfactory could be\r\nafforded. The conspicuous bright line of the Draco nebula seemed to\r\nagree in position with one emitted by nitrogen, but has since proved to\r\nbe distinct from it; of its two fainter companions, one was unmistakably\r\nthe F line of hydrogen, while the other, in position intermediate\r\nbetween the two, still remains unidentified.\r\n\r\nBy 1868 Huggins had satisfactorily examined the spectra of about seventy\r\nnebulæ, of which one-third displayed a gaseous character.[1511] All of\r\nthese gave the green ray fundamental to the nebular spectrum, and\r\nemanating from an unknown form of matter named by Sir William Huggins\r\n\"nebulum.\" It is associated with seven or eight hydrogen lines, with\r\nthree of \"yellow\" helium, and with a good many of undetermined origin.\r\nThe absence of the crimson radiation of hydrogen--perceived with\r\ndifficulty only in some highly condensed objects--is an anomaly very\r\nimperfectly explained as a physiological effect connected with the\r\nextreme faintness of nebular light.[1512] An approximate coincidence\r\nbetween the chief nebular line and a \"fluting\" of magnesium having been\r\nalleged by Lockyer in support of his meteoritic hypothesis of nebular\r\nconstitution, it became of interest to ascertain its reality. The task\r\nwas accomplished by Sir William and Lady Huggins in 1889 and 1890,[1513]\r\nand by Professor Keeler, with the advantages of the Mount Hamilton\r\napparatus and atmosphere, in 1890-91.[1514] The upshot was to show a\r\nslight but sure discrepancy as to place, and a marked diversity as to\r\ncharacter, between the two qualities of light. The nebular ray\r\n(wave-length 5,007 millionths of a millimetre) is slightly more\r\nrefrangible than the magnesium fluting-edge, and it is sharp and fine,\r\nwith no trace of the unilateral haze necessarily clinging even to the\r\nlast \"remnant\" of a banded formation.\r\n\r\nPlanetary and annular nebulæ are, without exception, gaseous, as well as\r\nthose termed \"irregular,\" which frequent the region of the Milky Way.\r\nTheir constitution usually betrays itself to the eye by their blue or\r\ngreenish colour; while those yielding a continuous spectrum are of a\r\ndull white. Among the more remarkable of these are the well-known nebula\r\nin Andromeda, and the great spiral in Canes Venatici; and, as a general\r\nrule, the emissions of all such nebulæ as present the appearance of\r\nstar-clusters grown misty through excessive distance are of the same\r\nkind. It would, however, be eminently rash to conclude thence that they\r\nare really aggregations of sun-like bodies. The improbability of such an\r\ninference has been greatly enhanced by the occurrence, at an interval of\r\na quarter of a century, of stellar outbursts in the midst of two of\r\nthem. For it is practically certain that the temporary stars were\r\nequally remote with the hazy formations they illuminated; hence, if the\r\nconstituent particles of the latter be suns, the incomparably vaster\r\norbs by which their feeble light was well-nigh obliterated must, as was\r\nargued by Mr. Proctor, have been on a scale of magnitude such as the\r\nimagination recoils from contemplating. Nevertheless, Dr. Scheiner, not\r\nwithout much difficulty, obtained, in January, 1899, spectrographic\r\nprints of the Andromeda nebula, indicative, he thought, of its being a\r\ncluster of solar stars.[1515] Sir William and Lady Huggins, on the other\r\nhand, _saw_, in 1897, bright intermixed with dark bands in the spectrum\r\nof the same object.[1516] And Mr. Maunder conjectures all \"white\" nebulæ\r\nto be made up of sunlets in which the coronal element predominates,\r\nwhile chromospheric materials assert their presence in nebulæ of the\r\n\"green\" variety.[1517]\r\n\r\nAmong the ascertained analogies between the stellar and nebular systems\r\nis that of variability of light. On October 11, 1852, Mr. Hind\r\ndiscovered a small nebula in Taurus. Chacornac observed it at Marseilles\r\nin 1854, but was confounded four years later to find it vanished.\r\nD'Arrest missed it October 3, and redetected it December 29, 1861. It\r\nwas easily seen in 1865-66, but invisible in the most powerful\r\ninstruments from 1877 to 1880.[1518] Barnard, however, made out an\r\nalmost evanescent trace of it, October 15, 1890, with the great Lick\r\ntelescope,[1519] and saw it easily in the spring of 1895, while six\r\nmonths later it evaded his most diligent search.[1520] Then again, on\r\nSeptember 28, 1897, the Yerkes 40-inch disclosed it to him as a mere\r\nshimmer at the last limit of visibility; and it came out in three\r\ndiffuse patches on plates to which, on December 6 and 27, 1899, Keeler\r\ngave prolonged exposures with the Crossley reflector.[1521] Moreover, a\r\nfairly bright adjacent nebula, perceived by O. Struve in 1868, and\r\nobserved shortly afterwards by d'Arrest, has totally vanished, and was\r\nmost likely only a temporary apparition. These are the most authentic\r\ninstances of nebular variability. Many others have been more or less\r\nplausibly alleged;[1522] but Professor Holden's persuasion, acquired\r\nfrom an exhaustive study of the records since 1758,[1523] that the\r\nvarious parts of the Orion nebula fluctuate continually in relative\r\nlustre, has not been ratified by photographic evidence.\r\n\r\nThe case of the \"trifid\" nebula in Sagittarius, investigated by Holden\r\nin 1877,[1524] is less easily disposed of. What is certain is that a\r\nremarkable triple star, centrally situated, according to the\r\nobservations of both the Herschels, 1784-1833, in a dark space between\r\nthe three great _lobes_ of the nebula, is now, and has been since 1839,\r\ndensely involved in one of them; and since the hypothesis of relative\r\nmotion is on many grounds inadmissible, the change that has apparently\r\ntaken place must be in the distribution of light. One no less\r\nconspicuous was adduced by Mr. H. C. Russell, director of the Sydney\r\nObservatory.[1525] A particularly bright part of the great Argo nebula,\r\nas drawn by Sir John Herschel, has, it would seem, almost totally\r\ndisappeared. He noticed its absence in 1871, using a 7-inch telescope,\r\nfailed equally later on to find it with an 11-1/2-inch, and his\r\nlong-exposure photographs show no vestige of it. The same structure is\r\nmissing from, or scarcely traceable in, a splendid picture of the nebula\r\ntaken by Sir David Gill in twelve hours distributed over four nights in\r\nMarch, 1892.[1526] An immense gaseous expanse has, it would seem, sunk\r\nout of sight. Materially it is no doubt there; but the radiance has left\r\nit.\r\n\r\nNebulæ have no ascertained proper motions. No genuine change of place in\r\nthe heavens has yet been recorded for any one of them. All equally hold\r\naloof, so far as telescopic observation shows, from the busy journeyings\r\nof the stars. This seeming immobility is partly an effect of vast\r\ndistance. Nebular parallax has, up to the present, proved evanescent,\r\nand nebular parallactic drift, in response to the sun's advance through\r\nspace, remains likewise imperceptible.[1527] It may hence be presumed\r\nthat no nebulæ occur within the sphere occupied by the nearer stars. But\r\nthe difficulty of accurately measuring such objects must also be taken\r\ninto account. Displacements which would be conspicuous in stars might\r\neasily escape detection in ill-defined, hazy masses. Thus the measures\r\nexecuted by d'Arrest in 1857[1528] have not yet proved effective for\r\ntheir designed purpose of contributing to the future detection of proper\r\nmotions. Some determinations made by Mr. Burnham with the Lick refractor\r\nin 1891,[1529] will ultimately afford a more critical test. He found\r\nthat nearly all planetary nebulæ include a sharp stellar nucleus, the\r\nposition of which with reference to neighbouring stars could be fixed no\r\nless precisely than if it were devoid of nebulous surroundings. Hence,\r\nthe objects located by him cannot henceforward shift, were it only to\r\nthe extent of a small fraction of a second, without the fact coming to\r\nthe knowledge of astronomers.\r\n\r\nThe spectroscope, however, here as elsewhere, can supplement the\r\ntelescope; and what it has to tell, it tells at once, without the\r\nnecessity of waiting on time to ripen results. Sir William Huggins made,\r\nin 1874,[1530] the earliest experiments on the radial movements of\r\nnebulæ. But with only a negative upshot. None of the six objects\r\nexamined gave signs of spectral alteration, and it was estimated that\r\nthey must have done so had they been in course of recession from or\r\napproach towards the earth by as much as twenty-five miles a second.\r\nWith far more powerful appliances, Professor Keeler renewed the attempt\r\nat Lick in 1890-91. His success was unequivocal. Ten planetary nebulæ\r\nyielded perfectly satisfactory evidence of line-of-sight motion,[1531]\r\nthe swiftest traveller being the well-known greenish globe in\r\nDraco,[1532] found to be hurrying towards the earth at the rate of forty\r\nmiles a second. For the Orion nebula, a recession of about eleven miles\r\nwas determined,[1533] the whole of which may, however, very well belong\r\nto the solar system itself, which, by its translation towards the\r\nconstellation Lyra, is certainly leaving the great nebula pretty rapidly\r\nbehind. The anomaly of seeming nebular fixity has nevertheless been\r\nremoved; and the problem of nebular motion has begun to be solved\r\nthrough the demonstrated possibility of its spectroscopic investigation.\r\n\r\nKeeler's were the first trustworthy determinations of radial motion\r\nobtained visually. That the similar work on the stars begun at Greenwich\r\nin 1874, and carried on for thirteen years, remained comparatively\r\nunfruitful, was only what might have been expected, the instruments\r\navailable there being altogether inadequate for the attainment of a high\r\ndegree of accuracy.\r\n\r\nThe various obstacles in the way of securing it were overcome by the\r\nsubstitution of the sensitive plate for the eye. Air-tremors are thus\r\nrendered comparatively innocuous; and measurements of stellar lines\r\ndisplaced by motion with reference to fiducial lines from terrestrial\r\nsources, photographed on the same plates, can be depended upon within\r\nvastly reduced limits of error. Studies for the realisation of the\r\n\"spectrographic\" method were begun by Dr. Vogel and his able assistant,\r\nDr. Scheiner, at Potsdam in 1887. Their preliminary results,\r\ncommunicated to the Berlin Academy of Sciences, March 15, 1888, already\r\nshowed that the requirements for effective research in this important\r\nbranch were at last about to be complied with. An improved instrument\r\nwas erected in the autumn of the same year, and the fifty-one stars,\r\nbright enough for determination with a refractor of 11 inches aperture,\r\nwere promptly taken in hand. A list of their motions in the line of\r\nsight, published in 1892,[1534] was of high value, both in itself and\r\nfor what it promised. One noteworthy inference from the data it\r\ncollected was that the eye tends, under unfavourable circumstances, to\r\nexaggerate the line-displacements it attempts to estimate. The\r\nvelocities photographically arrived at were of much smaller amounts than\r\nthose visually assigned. The average speed of the Potsdam stars came out\r\nonly 10·4 miles a second, the quickest among them being Aldebaran, with\r\na recession of thirty miles a second. More lately, however, Deslandres\r\nand Campbell have determined for Zeta Herculis and Eta Cephei\r\nrespectively approaching rates of forty-four and fifty-four miles\r\na second.\r\n\r\nThe installation, in 1900, of a photographic refractor 31-1/2 inches in\r\naperture, coupled with a 20-inch guiding telescope, will enable Dr.\r\nVogel to investigate spectrographically some hundreds of stars fainter\r\nthan the second magnitude; and the materials thus accumulated should\r\nlargely help to provide means for a definite and complete solution of\r\nthe more than secular problem of the sun's advance through space. The\r\nsolution should be complete, because including a genuine determination\r\nof the sun's velocity, apart from assumptions of any kind. M. Homann's\r\nattempt, in 1885,[1535] to extract some provisional information on the\r\nsubject from the radial movements of visually determined stars gave a\r\nfair earnest of what might be done with materials of a better quality.\r\nHe arrived at a goal for the sun's way shifted eastward to the\r\nconstellation Cygnus--a result congruous with the marked tendency of\r\nrecently determined apexes to collect in or near Lyra; and the most\r\nprobable corresponding velocity seemed to be about nineteen miles a\r\nsecond, or just that of the earth in its orbit. A more elaborate\r\ninvestigation of the same kind, based by Professor Campbell in\r\n1900[1536] upon the motions of 280 stars, determined with extreme\r\nprecision, suffered in completeness through lack of available data from\r\nthe southern hemisphere. The outcome, accordingly, was an apex most\r\nlikely correctly placed as regards right ascension, but displaced\r\nsouthward by some fifteen degrees. The speed of twelve miles a second,\r\nassigned to the solar translation, approximates doubtless very closely\r\nto the truth.\r\n\r\nA successful beginning was made in nebular spectrography by Sir William\r\nHuggins, March 7, 1882.[1537] Five lines in all stamped themselves upon\r\nthe plate during forty-five minutes of exposure to the rays of the\r\nstrange object in Orion. Of these, four were the known visible lines,\r\nand a fifth, high up in the ultra-violet, at wave-length 3,727, has\r\nevidently peculiar relationships, as yet imperfectly apprehended. It is\r\nstrong in the spectra of many planetaries; it helped to characterise the\r\nnebular metamorphosis of Nova Aurigæ, yet failed to appear in Nova\r\nPersei. Two additional hydrogen lines, making six in all, were\r\nphotographed at Tulse Hill, from the Orion nebula, in 1890;[1538] and\r\nDr. Copeland's detection in 1886[1539] of the yellow ray D_3 gave the\r\nfirst hint of the presence of helium in this prodigious formation. Nor\r\nare there wanting spectroscopic indications of its physical connection\r\nwith the stars visually involved in it. Sir William and Lady Huggins\r\nfound a plate exposed February 5, 1888, impressed with four groups of\r\nfine bright lines, originating in the continuous light of two of the\r\ntrapezium-stars, but extending some way into the surrounding\r\nnebula.[1540] And Dr. Scheiner[1541] argued a wider relationship from\r\nthe common possession, by the nebula and the chief stars in the\r\nconstellation Orion, of a blue line, bright in the one case, dark in the\r\nothers, since identified as a member of one of the helium series.\r\n\r\nThe structural unity of the stellar and nebular orders in this extensive\r\nregion of the sky has also, by direct photographic means, been\r\nunmistakably affirmed.\r\n\r\nThe first promising autographic picture of the Orion nebula was obtained\r\nby Draper, September 30, 1880.[1542] The marked approach towards a still\r\nmore perfectly satisfactory result shown by his plates of March, 1881\r\nand 1882, was unhappily cut short by his death. Meanwhile, M. Janssen\r\nwas at work in the same field from 1881, with his accustomed\r\nsuccess.[1543] But Dr. A. Ainslie Common left all competitors far behind\r\nwith a splendid picture, taken January 30, 1883, by means of an exposure\r\nof thirty-seven minutes in the focus of his 3-foot silver-on-glass\r\nmirror.[1544] Photography may thereby be said to have definitely assumed\r\nthe office of historiographer to the nebulæ, since this one impression\r\nembodies a mass of facts hardly to be compassed by months of labour with\r\nthe pencil, and affords a record of shape and relative brightness in the\r\nvarious parts of the stupendous object it delineates which must prove\r\ninvaluable to the students of its future condition. Its beauty and merit\r\nwere officially recognised by the award of the Astronomical Society's\r\nGold Medal in 1884.\r\n\r\nA second picture of equal merit, obtained by the same means, February\r\n28, 1883, with an exposure of one hour, is reproduced in the\r\nfrontispiece. The vignette includes two specimens of planetary\r\nphotography. The Jupiter, with the great red spot conspicuous in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere, is by Dr. Common. It dates from September 3, 1879,\r\nand was accordingly one of the earliest results with his 36-inch, the\r\ndirect image in which imprinted itself in a fraction of a second, and\r\nwas subsequently enlarged on paper about twelve times. The exquisite\r\nlittle picture of Saturn was taken at Paris by MM. Paul and Prosper\r\nHenry, December 21, 1885, with their 13-inch photographic refractor. The\r\ntelescopic image was in this case magnified eleven times previous to\r\nbeing photographed, an exposure of about five seconds being allowed; and\r\nthe total enlargement, as it now appears, is nineteen times. A trace of\r\nthe dusky ring perceptible on the original negative is lost in the\r\nprint.\r\n\r\nA photograph of the Orion nebula taken by Dr. Roberts in 67 minutes,\r\nNovember 30, 1886, made a striking disclosure of the extent of that\r\nprodigious object. More than six times the nebulous area depicted on Dr.\r\nCommon's plates is covered by it, and it plainly shows an adjacent\r\nnebula, separately catalogued by Messier, to belong to the same vast\r\nformation.\r\n\r\nThis disposition to annex and appropriate has come out more strongly\r\nwith every increase of photographic power. Plates exposed at Harvard\r\nCollege in March, 1888, with an 8-inch portrait-lens (the same used in\r\nthe preparation of the Draper Catalogue) showed the old-established\r\n\"Fish-mouth\" nebula not only to involve the stars of the sword-handle,\r\nbut to be in tolerably evident connection with the most easterly of the\r\nthree belt-stars, from which a remarkable nebulous appendage was found\r\nto proceed.[1545] A still more curious discovery was made by W. H.\r\nPickering in 1889.[1546] Photographs taken in three hours from the\r\nsummit of Wilson's Peak in California revealed the existence of an\r\nenormous, though faint spiral structure, enclosing in its span of nearly\r\nseventeen degrees the entire stellar and nebulous group of the Belt and\r\nSword, from which it most likely, although not quite traceably, issues\r\nas if from a nucleus. A startling glimpse is thus afforded of the\r\ncosmical importance of that strange \"hiatus\" in the heavens which\r\nexcited the wonder of Huygens in 1656. The inconceivable attenuation of\r\nthe gaseous stuff composing it was virtually demonstrated by Mr.\r\nRanyard.[1547]\r\n\r\nIn March, 1885, Sir Howard Grubb mounted for Dr. Isaac Roberts, at\r\nMaghull, near Liverpool (his observatory has since been transferred to\r\nCrowborough in Sussex), a silver-on-glass reflector of twenty inches\r\naperture, constructed expressly for use in celestial photography. A\r\nseries of nebula-pictures, obtained with this fine instrument, have\r\nproved highly instructive both as to the structure and extent of these\r\nwonderful objects; above all, one of the great Andromeda nebula, to\r\nwhich an exposure of three hours was given on October 1, 1888.[1548] In\r\nit a convoluted structure replaced and rendered intelligible the\r\nanomalously rifted mass seen by Bond in 1847.[1549] The effects of\r\nannular condensation appeared to have stamped themselves upon the plate,\r\nand two attendant nebulæ presented the aspect of satellites already\r\nseparated from the parent body, and presumably revolving round it. The\r\nring-nebula in Lyra was photographed at Paris in 1886, and shortly\r\nafterwards by Von Gothard with a 10-inch reflector,[1550] and he\r\nsimilarly depicted in 1888 the two chief spiral and other nebulæ.[1551]\r\nPhotographs of the Lyra nebula taken at Algiers in 1890,[1552] and at\r\nthe Vatican observatory in 1892,[1553] were remarkable for the strong\r\ndevelopment of a central star, difficult of telescopic discernment, but\r\nevidently of primary importance to the annular structure around.\r\n\r\nThe uses of photography in celestial investigations become every year\r\nmore manifold and more apparent. The earliest chemical star-pictures\r\nwere those of Castor and Vega, obtained with the Cambridge refractor in\r\n1850 by Whipple of Boston under the direction of W. C. Bond. Double-star\r\nphotography was inaugurated under the auspices of G. P. Bond, April 27,\r\n1857, with an impression, obtained in eight seconds, of Mizar, the\r\nmiddle star in the handle of the Plough. A series of measures from\r\nsixty-two similar images gave the distance and position-angle of its\r\ncompanion with about the same accuracy attainable by ordinary\r\nmicrometrical operations; and the method and upshot of these novel\r\nexperiments were described in three papers remarkably forecasting the\r\npurposes to be served by stellar photography.[1554] The matter next fell\r\ninto the able hands of Rutherfurd, who completed in 1864 a fine object\r\nglass (of 11-1/2 inches) corrected for the ultra-violet rays,\r\nconsequently useless for visual purposes. The sacrifice was recompensed\r\nby conspicuous success. A set of measurements from his photographs of\r\nnearly fifty stars in the Pleiades, and their comparison with Bessel's\r\nplaces, enabled Dr. Gould to announce, in 1866, that during the\r\nintervening third of a century no changes of importance had occurred in\r\ntheir relative positions.[1555] And Mr. Harold Jacoby[1556] similarly\r\nascertained the fixity of seventy-five of Rutherfurd's Atlantids,\r\nbetween the epoch 1873 and that of Dr. Elkin's heliometric triangulation\r\nof the cluster in 1886,[1557] extending the interval to twenty-seven\r\nyears by subsequent comparisons with plates taken at Lick, September 27,\r\n1900.[1558] Positive, however, as well as negative results have ensued\r\nfrom the application of modern methods to that antique group.\r\n\r\nOn October 19, 1859, Wilhelm Tempel, a Saxon peasant by origin, later a\r\nskilled engraver, discovered with a small telescope, bought out of his\r\nscanty savings, an elliptical nebulosity, stretching far to the\r\nsouthward from the star Merope. It attracted the attention of many\r\nobservers, but was so often missed, owing to its extreme susceptibility\r\nto adverse atmospheric influences, as to rouse unfounded suspicions of\r\nits variability. The detection of this evasive object gave a hint,\r\nbarely intelligible at the time, of further revelations of the same kind\r\nby more cogent means.\r\n\r\nA splendid photograph of 1,421 stars in the Pleiades, taken by the MM.\r\nHenry with three hours' exposure, November 16, 1885, showed one of the\r\nbrightest of them to have a small spiral nebula, somewhat resembling a\r\nstrongly-curved comet's tail, attached to it. The reappearance of this\r\nstrange appurtenance on three subsequent plates left no doubt of its\r\nreal existence, visually attested at Pulkowa, February 5, 1886, by one\r\nof the first observations made with the 30-inch equatoreal.[1559] Much\r\nsmaller apertures, however, sufficed to disclose the \"Maia nebula,\"\r\n_once it was known to be there_. Not only did it appear greatly extended\r\nin the Vienna 27-inch,[1560] but MM. Perrotin and Thollon saw it with\r\nthe Nice 15-inch, and M. Kammermann of Geneva, employing special\r\nprecautions, with a refractor of only ten inches aperture.[1561] The\r\nadvantage derived by him for bringing it into view, from the insertion\r\ninto the eye-piece of a uranium film, gives, with its photographic\r\nintensity, valid proof that a large proportion of the light of this\r\nremarkable object is of the ultra-violet kind.\r\n\r\nThe beginning thus made was quickly followed up. A picture of the\r\nPleiades procured at Maghull in eighty-nine minutes, October 23, 1886,\r\nrevealed nebulous surroundings to no less than four leading stars of the\r\ngroup, namely, Alcyone, Electra, Merope, and Maia; and a second\r\nimpression, taken in three hours on the following night, showed further\r\n\"that the nebulosity extends in streamers and fleecy masses till it\r\nseems almost to fill the spaces between the stars, and to extend far\r\nbeyond them.\"[1562] The coherence of the entire mixed structure was,\r\nmoreover, placed beyond doubt by the visibly close relationship of the\r\nstars to the nebulous formations surrounding them in Dr. Roberts's\r\nstriking pictures. Thus Goldschmidt's notion that all the clustered\r\nPleiades constitute, as it were, a second Orion trapezium in the midst\r\nof a huge formation of which Tempel's nebula is but a fragment,[1563]\r\nhas been to some extent verified. Yet it seemed fantastic enough in\r\n1863.\r\n\r\nThen in 1888 the MM. Henry gave exposures of four hours each to several\r\nplates, which exhibited on development some new features of the\r\nentangled nebulæ. The most curious of these was the linking together of\r\nstars by nebulous chains. In one case seven aligned stars appeared\r\nstrung on a silvery filament, \"like beads on a rosary.\"[1564] The \"rows\r\nof stars,\" so often noticed in the sky, may, then, be concluded to have\r\nmore than an imaginary existence. Of the 2,326 stars recorded in these\r\npictures, a couple of hundred among the brightest can, at the outside,\r\nbe reckoned as genuine Pleiades. The great majority were relegated, by\r\nPickering's[1565] and Stratonoff's[1566] counts of the stellar populace\r\n_in_ and _near_ the cluster, to the position of outsiders from it. They\r\nare undistinguished denizens of the abysmal background upon which it is\r\nprojected.\r\n\r\nInvestigations of its condition were carried a stage further by Barnard.\r\nOn November 14, 1890,[1567] he discovered visually with the Lick\r\nrefractor a close nebulous satellite to Merope, photographs of which\r\nwere obtained by Keeler in 1898.[1568] It appears in them of a rudely\r\npentagonal shape, a prominent angle being directed towards the adjacent\r\nstar. Finally, an exposure of ten hours made by Barnard with the Willard\r\nlens indicated the singular fact that the entire group is embedded in a\r\nnebulous matrix, streaky outliers of which blur a wide surface of the\r\ncelestial vault.[1569] The artist's conviction of the reality of what\r\nhis picture showed was confirmed by negatives obtained by Bailey at\r\nArequipa in 1897, and by H. C. Wilson at Northfield (Minnesota) in\r\n1898.[1570]\r\n\r\nWith the Ealing 3-foot reflector, sold by Dr. Common to Mr. Crossley,\r\nand by him presented to the Lick Observatory, Professor Keeler took in\r\n1899 a series of beautiful and instructive nebula[1571] photographs; One\r\nof the Trifid may be singled out as of particular excellence. An\r\nastonishing multitude of new nebulæ were revealed by trial-exposures\r\nwith this instrument. A \"conservative estimate\" gave 120,000 as the\r\nnumber coming within its scope. Moreover, the majority of those actually\r\nrecorded were of an unmistakable spiral character, and they included\r\nmost of Sir John Herschel's \"double nebulæ,\" previously supposed to\r\nexemplify the primitive history of binary stellar systems.[1572] Dr. Max\r\nWolf's explorations with a 6-inch Voigtländer lens in 1901 emphatically\r\nreaffirmed the inexhaustible wealth of the nebular heavens. In one\r\nrestricted region, midway between Præsepe and the Milky Way, he located\r\n135 nebulæ, where only three had until then been catalogued; and he\r\ncounted 108 such objects clustering round the star 31 Comæ\r\nBerenices,[1573] and so closely that all might be occulted together by\r\nthe moon. The general photographic Catalogue of Nebulæ which Dr. Wolf\r\nhas begun to prepare[1574] will thus be a most voluminous work.\r\n\r\nThe history of celestial photography at the Cape of Good Hope began with\r\nthe appearance of the great comet of 1882. No special apparatus was at\r\nhand; so Sir David Gill called in the services of a local artist, Mr.\r\nAllis of Mowbray, with whose camera, strapped to the Observatory\r\nequatoreal, pictures of conspicuous merit were obtained. But their\r\nparticular distinction lay in the multitude of stars begemming the\r\nbackground. (See Plate III.) The sight of them at once opened to the\r\nRoyal Astronomer a new prospect. He had already formed the project of\r\nextending Argelander's \"Durchmusterung\" from the point where it was left\r\nby Schönfeld to the southern pole; and his ideas regarding the means of\r\ncarrying it into execution crystallised at the needle touch of the\r\ncometary experiments. He resolved to employ photography for the purpose.\r\nThe exposure of plates was accordingly begun, under the care of Mr. Ray\r\nWoods, in 1885; and in less than six years, the sky, from 19° of south\r\nlatitude to the pole, had been covered in duplicate. Their measurement,\r\nand the preparation of a catalogue of the stars imprinted upon them,\r\nwere generously undertaken by Professor Kapteyn, and his laborious task\r\nhas at length been successfully completed. The publication, in 1900, of\r\nthe third and concluding volume of the \"Cape Photographic\r\nDurchmusterung\"[1575] placed at the disposal of astronomers a\r\nphotographic census of the heavens fuller and surer than the\r\ncorresponding visual enumeration executed at Bonn. It includes 454,875\r\nstars, nearly to the tenth magnitude, and their positions are reliable\r\nto about one second of arc.\r\n\r\nThe production of this important work was thus a result of the Cape\r\ncomet-pictures; yet not the most momentous one. They turned the scale in\r\nfavour of recourse to the camera when the MM. Henry encountered, in\r\ntheir continuation of Chacornac's half-finished enterprise of ecliptical\r\ncharting, sections of the Milky Way defying the enumerating efforts of\r\neye and hand. The perfect success of some preliminary experiments made\r\nwith an instrument constructed by them expressly for the purpose was\r\nannounced to the Academy of Sciences at Paris, May 2, 1885. By its means\r\nstars estimated as of the sixteenth magnitude clearly recorded their\r\npresence and their places; and the enormous increase of knowledge\r\ninvolved may be judged of from the fact that, in a space of the Milky\r\nWay in Cygnus 2° 15' by 3°, where 170 stars had been mapped by the old\r\nlaborious method, about five thousand stamped their images on a single\r\nHenry plate.\r\n\r\nThese results suggested the grand undertaking of a general photographic\r\nsurvey of the heavens, and Gill's proposal, June 4, 1886, of an\r\nInternational Congress for the purpose of setting it on foot was\r\nreceived with acclamation, and promptly acted upon. Fifty-six delegates\r\nof seventeen different nationalities met in Paris, April 16, 1887, under\r\nthe presidentship of Admiral Mouchez, to discuss measures and organise\r\naction. They resolved upon the construction of a Photographic Chart of\r\nthe whole heavens, comprising stars of a fourteenth magnitude, to the\r\nsurmised number of twenty millions; to be supplemented by a Catalogue,\r\nframed from plates of comparatively short exposure, giving start to the\r\neleventh magnitude. These will probably amount to about one million and\r\na quarter. For procuring both sets of plates, instruments were\r\nconstructed precisely similar to that of the MM. Henry, which is a\r\nphotographic refractor, thirteen inches in aperture, and eleven feet\r\nfocus, attached to a guiding telescope of eleven inches aperture,\r\ncorrected, of course, for the visual rays. Each place covers an area of\r\nfour square degrees, and since the series must be duplicated to prevent\r\nmistakes, about 22,000 plates will be needed for the Chart alone. The\r\ntask of preparing them was apportioned among eighteen observatories\r\nscattered over the globe, from Mexico to Melbourne; but three in South\r\nAmerica having become disabled or inert, were replaced in 1900 by those\r\nat Cordoba, Montevideo, and Perth, Western Australia. Meanwhile, the\r\npublication of results has begun, and is likely to continue for at least\r\na quarter of a century. The first volume of measures from the Potsdam\r\nCatalogue-plates was issued in 1899, and its successors, if on the same\r\nscale, must number nearly 400. Moreover, ninety-six heliogravure\r\nenlargements from the Paris Chart-plates, distributed in the same year,\r\nsupplied a basis for the calculation that the entire Atlas of the sky,\r\ncomposed of similar sheets, will form a pile thirty feet high and two\r\ntons in weight![1576] It will, however, possess an incalculable\r\nscientific value. For millions of stars can be determined by its means,\r\nfrom their imprinted images, with an accuracy comparable to that\r\nattainable by direct meridian observations.\r\n\r\nOne of the most ardent promoters of the scheme it may be expected to\r\nrealise was Admiral Mouchez, the successor of Leverrier in the direction\r\nof the Paris Observatory. But it was not granted to him to see the\r\nfruition of his efforts. He died suddenly June 25, 1892.[1577] Although\r\nnot an astronomer by profession, he had been singularly successful in\r\npushing forward the cause of the science he loved, while his genial and\r\nopen nature won for him wide personal regard. He was replaced by M.\r\nTisserand, whose mathematical eminence fitted him to continue the\r\ntraditions of Delaunay and Leverrier. But his career, too, was unhappily\r\ncut short by an unforeseen death on October 20, 1896; and the more\r\neminent among the many qualifications of his successor, M. Maurice\r\nLoewy, are of the practical kind.\r\n\r\nThe sublime problem of the construction of the heavens has not been\r\nneglected amid the multiplicity of tasks imposed upon the cultivators of\r\nastronomy by its rapid development. But data of a far higher order of\r\nprecision, and indefinitely greater in amount, than those at the\r\ndisposal of Herschel or Struve must be accumulated before any definite\r\nconclusions on the subject are possible. The first organised effort\r\ntowards realising this desideratum was made by the German Astronomical\r\nSociety in 1865, two years after its foundation at Heidelberg. The\r\noriginal programme consisted in the _exact_ determination of the places\r\nof all Argelander's stars to the ninth magnitude (exclusive of the polar\r\nzone), from the reobservation of which, say, in the year 1950,\r\nastronomers of two generations hence may gather a vast store of\r\nknowledge--directly of the apparent motions, indirectly of the mutual\r\nrelations binding together the suns and systems of space. Thirteen\r\nobservatories in Europe and America joined in the work, now virtually\r\nterminated. Its scope was, after its inception, widened to include\r\nsouthern zones as far as the Tropic of Capricorn; this having been\r\nrendered feasible by Schönfeld's extension (1875-1885) of Argelander's\r\nsurvey. Thirty thousand additional stars thus taken in were allotted in\r\nzones to five observatories. Another important undertaking of the same\r\nclass is the reobservation of the 47,300 stars in Lalande's _Histoire\r\nCéleste_. Begun under Arago in 1855, its upshot has been the publication\r\nof the great Paris Catalogue, issued in eight volumes, between 1887 and\r\n1902. From a careful study of their secular changes in position, M.\r\nBossert has already derived the proper motions of a couple of thousand\r\nout of nearly fifty thousand stars enumerated in it.\r\n\r\nThrough Dr. Gould's unceasing labours during his fifteen years'\r\nresidence at Cordoba, a detailed acquaintance with southern stars was\r\nbrought about. His _Uranometria Argentina_ (1879) enumerates the\r\nmagnitudes of 8,198 out of 10,649 stars visible to the naked eye under\r\nthose transparent skies; 33,160 down to 9-1/2 magnitude are embraced in\r\nhis \"zones\"; and the Argentine General Catalogue of 32,468 southern\r\nstars was published in 1886. Valuable work of the same kind has been\r\ndone at the Leander McCormick Observatory, Virginia, by Professor O.\r\nStone; while the late Redcliffe observer's \"Cape Catalogue for 1880\"\r\naffords inestimable aid to the practical astronomer south of the line,\r\nwhich has been reinforced with several publications issued by the\r\npresent Astronomer Royal at the Cape. Moreover, the gigantic task\r\nentered upon in 1860 by Dr. C. H. F. Peters, director of the Litchfield\r\nObservatory, Clinton (N.Y.), and of which a large instalment was\r\nfinished in 1882, deserves honourable mention. It was nothing less than\r\nto map all stars down to, and even below, the fourteenth magnitude,\r\nsituated within 30° on either side of the ecliptic, and so to afford \"a\r\nsure basis for drawing conclusions with respect to the changes going on\r\nin the starry heavens.\"[1578]\r\n\r\nIt is tolerably safe to predict that no work of its kind and for its\r\npurpose will ever again be undertaken. In a small part of one night\r\nstars can now be got to register themselves more numerously and more\r\naccurately than by the eye and hand of the most skilled observer in the\r\ncourse of a year. Fundamental catalogues, constructed by the old,\r\ntime-honoured method, will continue to furnish indispensable\r\nstarting-points for measurement; and one of especial excellence was\r\npublished by Professor Newcomb in 1899;[1579] but the relative places of\r\nthe small crowded stars--the sidereal [Greek: hoi pholloi]--will\r\nhenceforth be derived from their autographic statements on the sensitive\r\nplate. Even the secondary purpose--that of asteroidal discovery--served\r\nby detailed stellar enumeration, is more surely attained by photography\r\nthan by laborious visual comparison. For planetary movement betrays\r\nitself in a comparatively short time by turning the imprinted image of\r\nthe object affected by it from a dot into a trail.\r\n\r\nIn the arduous matter of determining star distances progress has been\r\nsteady, and bids fair to become rapidly accelerated. Together, yet\r\nindependently, Gill and Elkin carried out, at the Cape Observatory in\r\n1882-83, an investigation of remarkable accuracy into the parallaxes of\r\nnine southern stars. One of these was the famous Alpha Centauri,\r\nthe distance of which from the earth was ascertained to be just\r\none-third greater than Henderson had made it. The parallax of Sirius, on\r\nthe other hand, was doubled, or its distance halved; while Canopus\r\nproved to be quite immeasurably remote--a circumstance which,\r\nconsidering that, among all the stellar multitude, it is outshone only\r\nby the radiant Dog-star, gives a stupendous idea of its real splendour\r\nand dimensions.\r\n\r\nInquiries of this kind were, for some years, successfully pursued at the\r\nobservatory of Dunsink, near Dublin. Annual perspective displacements\r\nwere by Dr. Brünnow detected in several stars, and in others remeasured\r\nwith a care which inspired just confidence. His parallax for Alpha\r\nLyræ (0·13\") was authentic, though slightly too large (Elkin's final\r\nresults gave Pi = 0·082\"); and the received value for the\r\nparallax of the swiftly travelling star \"Groombridge 1,830\" scarcely\r\ndiffers from that arrived at by him in 1871 (Pi = 0·09\"). His\r\nsuccessor as Astronomer-Royal for Ireland, Sir Robert Stawell Ball (now\r\nLowndean Professor of Astronomy in the University of Cambridge), has\r\ndone good service in the same department. For besides verifying\r\napproximately Struve's parallax of half a second of arc for 61 Cygni, he\r\nrefuted, in 1811, by a sweeping search for (so-called) \"large\"\r\nparallaxes, certain baseless conjectures of comparative nearness to the\r\nearth, in the case of red and temporary stars.[1580] Of 450 objects thus\r\ncursorily examined, only one star of the seventh magnitude, numbered\r\n1,618 in Groombridge's Circumpolar Catalogue, gave signs of measurable\r\nvicinity. Similarly, a reconnaissance among rapidly moving stars lately\r\nmade by Dr. Chase with the Yale heliometer[1581] yielded no really\r\nlarge, and only eight appreciable parallaxes among the 92 subjects of\r\nhis experiments.\r\n\r\nA second campaign in stellar parallax was undertaken by Gill and Elkin\r\nin 1887. But this time the two observers were in opposite hemispheres.\r\nBoth used heliometers. Dr. Elkin had charge of the fine instrument then\r\nrecently erected in Yale College Observatory; Sir David Gill employed\r\none of seven inches, just constructed under his directions, in\r\nfirst-rate style, by the Repsolds of Hamburg. Dr. Elkin completed in\r\n1888 his share of the more immediate joint programme, which consisted in\r\nthe determination, by direct measurement, of the average parallax of\r\nstars of the first magnitude. It came out, for the ten northern\r\nluminaries, after several revisions, 0·098\", equivalent to a\r\nlight-journey of thirty-three years. The deviations from this average\r\nwere, indeed, exceedingly wide. Two of the stars, Betelgeux and\r\nAlpha Cygni, gave no certain sign of any perspective shifting; of the rest,\r\nProcyon, with a parallax of 0·334\", proved the nearest to our system. At\r\nthe mean distance concluded for these ten brilliant stars, the sun would\r\nshow as of only fifth magnitude; hence it claims a very subordinate rank\r\namong the suns of space. Sir David Gill's definitive results were\r\npublished in 1900.[1582] As the average parallax of the eleven brightest\r\nstars in the southern hemisphere, they gave 0·13\", a value enhanced by\r\nthe exceptional proximity of Alpha Centauri. Yet four of these\r\nconspicuous objects--Canopus, Rigel, Spica, and Beta Crucis--gave\r\nno sign of perspective response to the annual change in our point of\r\nview. The list included eleven fainter stars with notable proper\r\nmotions, and most of these proved to have fairly large parallaxes. Among\r\nother valuable contributions to this difficult branch may be instanced\r\nBruno Peter's measurements of eleven stars with the Leipzig heliometer,\r\n1887-92;[1583] Kapteyn's application of the method by differences in\r\nright ascension to fifteen stars observed on the meridian 1885-89;[1584]\r\nand Flint's more recent similar determinations at Madison,\r\nWisconsin.[1585]\r\n\r\nThe great merit of having rendered photography available for the\r\nsounding of the celestial depths belongs to Professor Pritchard. The\r\nsubject of his initial experiment was 61 Cygni. From measurements of 200\r\nnegatives taken in 1886, he derived for that classic star a parallax of\r\n0·438\", in satisfactory agreement with Ball's of 0·468\". A detailed\r\nexamination convinced the Astronomer-Royal of its superior accuracy to\r\nBessel's result with the heliometer. The Savilian Professor carried out\r\nhis project of determining all second magnitude stars to the number of\r\nabout thirty,[1586] conveniently observable at Oxford, obtaining as the\r\ngeneral outcome of the research an average parallax of 0·056\", for\r\nobjects of that rank. But this value, though in itself probable, cannot\r\nbe accepted as authoritative, in view of certain inaccuracies in the\r\nwork adverted to by Jacoby,[1587] Hermann Davis, and Gill. The method\r\nhas, nevertheless, very large capabilities. Professor Kapteyn showed, in\r\n1889,[1588] the practicability of deriving parallaxes wholesale from\r\nplates exposed at due intervals, and applied his system, in 1900, with\r\nencouraging success, to a group of 248 stars.[1589] The apparent absence\r\nof spurious shiftings justified the proposal to follow up the completion\r\nof the Astrographic Chart with the initiation of a photographic\r\n\"Parallax Durchmusterung.\"\r\n\r\nObservers of double stars are among the most meritorious, and need to be\r\namong the most patient and painstaking workers in sidereal astronomy.\r\nThey are scarcely as numerous as could be wished. Dr. Doberck,\r\ndistinguished as a computer of stellar orbits, complained in 1882[1590]\r\nthat data sufficient for the purpose had not been collected for above 30\r\nor 40 binaries out of between five and six hundred certainly or probably\r\nwithin reach. The progress since made is illustrated by Mr. Gore's\r\nuseful Catalogue of Computed Binaries, including fifty-nine entries,\r\npresented to the Royal Irish Academy, June 9, 1890.[1591] Few have done\r\nmore towards supplying the deficiency of materials than the late Baron\r\nErcole Dembowski of Milan. He devoted the last thirty years of his life,\r\nwhich came to an end January 19, 1881, to the revision of the Dorpat\r\nCatalogue, and left behind him a store of micrometrical measures as\r\nnumerous as they are precise.\r\n\r\nOf living observers in this branch, Mr. S. W. Burnham is beyond question\r\nthe foremost. While pursuing legal avocations at Chicago, he diverted\r\nhis scanty leisure by exploring the skies with a 6-inch telescope\r\nmounted in his back-yard; and had discovered, in May, 1882, one thousand\r\nclose and mostly very difficult double stars.[1592] Summoned as chief\r\nassistant to the new Lick Observatory in 1888, he resumed the work of\r\nhis predilection with the 36-inch and 12-inch refractors of that\r\nestablishment. But although devoting most of his attention to\r\nmuch-needed remeasurements of known pairs, he incidentally divided no\r\nless than 274 stars, the majority of which lay beyond the resolving\r\npower of less keen and effectually aided eyesight. One of his many\r\ninteresting discoveries was that of a minute companion to Alpha\r\nUrsæ Majoris (the first Pointer), which already gives unmistakable signs\r\nof orbital movement round the shining orb it is attached to. Another\r\npair, Kappa Pegasi, detected in 1880, was found in 1892 to have\r\nmore than completed a circuit in the interim.[1593] Its period of a\r\nlittle over eleven years is the shortest attributable to a _visible_\r\nbinary system, except that of Delta Equulei, provisionally\r\ndetermined by Professor Hussey in 1900 at 5·7 years,[1594] and indicated\r\nby spectroscopic evidence to be of uncommon brevity.[1595] Burnham's\r\nCatalogue of 1,290 Double Stars, discovered by him from 1871 to\r\n1899,[1596] is a record of unprecedented interest. Nearly all the 690\r\npairs included in it, 2\" or less than 2\" apart, must be physically\r\nconnected; and they offer a practically unlimited field for\r\ninvestigation; while the notes, diagrams, and orbits appended profusely\r\nto the various entries, are eminently helpful to students and computers.\r\nThe author is continuing his researches at the Yerkes Observatory,\r\nhaving quitted the Lick establishment in 1892. The first complete\r\nenrolment of southern double stars was made by Mr. R. T. A. Innes in\r\n1899.[1597] The couples enumerated, twenty-one per cent. of which are\r\nseparated by less than one second of arc, are 2,140 in number. They\r\ninclude 305 discovered by himself. Dr. See gathered a rich harvest of\r\nnearly 500 new southern pairs with the Lowell 24-inch refractor in\r\n1897.[1598] Professor Hough's discoveries in more northerly zones amount\r\nto 623;[1599] Hussey's at Lick to 350; and Aitken's already to over 300.\r\n\r\nThere is as yet no certainty that the stars of 61 Cygni form a true\r\nbinary combination. Mr. Burnham, indeed, holds them to be in course of\r\ndefinitive separation; and Professor Hall's observations at Washington,\r\n1879 to 1891, although favouring their physical connection, are far from\r\ndecisive on the point.[1600] Dr. Wilsing, from certain anomalous\r\ndisplacements of their photographed images, concluded in 1893[1601] the\r\npresence of an invisible third member of the system, revolving in a\r\nperiod of twenty-two months; but the effects noticed by him were\r\nprobably illusory.\r\n\r\nImportant series of double-star observations were made by Perrotin at\r\nNice in 1883-4;[1602] by Hall, with the 26-inch Washington equatoreal,\r\n1874 to 1891;[1603] by Schiaparelli from 1875 onward; by Glasenapp, O.\r\nStone, Leavenworth, Seabroke, and many besides. Finally, Professor\r\nHussey's revision of the Pulkowa Catalogue[1604] is a work of the _teres\r\natque rotundus_ kind, which leaves little or nothing to be desired. The\r\nmethods employed in double-star determinations remain, at the beginning\r\nof the twentieth century, essentially unchanged. The camera has scarcely\r\nencroached upon this part of the micrometer's domain.[1605]\r\n\r\nA research of striking merit into the origin of binary stars was\r\npublished in 1892 by Dr. T. J. J. See, in the form of an Inaugural\r\nDissertation for his doctor's degree in the University of Berlin. The\r\nmain result was to show the powerful effects of tidal friction in\r\nprescribing the course of their development from double nebulæ,\r\nrevolving almost in contact, to double suns, far apart, yet inseparable.\r\nThe high eccentricities of their eventual orbits were shown to result\r\nnecessarily from this mode of action, which must operate with enormous\r\nstrength on closely conjoined, nearly equal masses, such as the rapidly\r\nrevolving pairs disclosed by the spectroscope. That these are still in\r\nan early stage of their life-history is probable in itself, and is\r\nre-affirmed by the exceedingly small density indicated for eclipsing\r\nstars by the ratio of phase-duration to period.\r\n\r\nStellar photometry, initiated by the elder Herschel, and provided with\r\nexact methods by his son at the Cape, by Steinheil and Seidel at Munich,\r\nhas of late years assumed the importance of a separate department of\r\nastronomical research. Two monumental works on the subject, compiled on\r\nopposite sides of the Atlantic, were thus appropriately coupled in the\r\nbestowal of the Royal Astronomical Society's Gold Medal in 1886. Harvard\r\nCollege Observatory led the way under the able direction of Professor E.\r\nC. Pickering. His photometric catalogue of 4,260 stars,[1606]\r\nconstructed from nearly 95,000 observations of light-intensity during\r\nthe years 1879-82, constitutes a record of incalculable value for the\r\ndetection and estimation of stellar variability. It was succeeded in\r\n1885 by Professor Pritchard's \"Uranometria Nova Oxoniensis,\" including\r\nphotometric determinations of the magnitude of all naked-eye stars, from\r\nthe pole to ten degrees south of the equator to the number of 2,784. The\r\ninstrument employed was the \"wedge photometer,\" which measures\r\nbrightness by resistance to extinction. A wedge of neutral-tint glass,\r\naccurately divided to scale, is placed in the path of the stellar rays,\r\nwhen the thickness of it they have power to traverse furnishes a\r\ncriterion of their intensity. Professor Pickering's \"meridian\r\nphotometer,\" on the other hand, is based upon Zöllner's principle of\r\nequalization effected by a polarising apparatus. After all, however, as\r\nProfessor Pritchard observed, \"the eye is the real photometer,\" and its\r\njudgment can only be valid over a limited range.[1607] Absolute\r\nuniformity, then, in estimates made by various means, under varying\r\nconditions, and by different observers, is not to be looked for; and it\r\nis satisfactory to find substantial agreement attainable and attained.\r\nOnly in an insignificant fraction of the stars common to the Harvard and\r\nOxford catalogues discordances are found exceeding one-third of a\r\nmagnitude; a large proportion (71 per cent.) agree within one-fourth, a\r\nconsiderable minority (31 per cent.) within one-tenth of a\r\nmagnitude.[1608] The Harvard photometry was extended, on the same scale,\r\nto the opposite pole in a catalogue of the magnitudes of 7,922 southern\r\nstars,[1609] founded on Professor Bailey's observations in Peru,\r\n1889-91. Measurements still more comprehensive were subsequently\r\nexecuted at the primary establishment. With a meridian photometer of\r\naugmented power, the surprising number of 473,216 settings were made\r\nduring the years 1891-98, nearly all by the indefatigable director\r\nhimself, and they afforded materials for a \"Photometric Durchmusterung,\"\r\npublished in 1901, including all stars to 7·5 magnitude north of\r\ndeclination -40°.[1610] A photometric zone, 20° wide, has for some time\r\nbeen in course of observation at Potsdam by MM. Müller and Kempf. The\r\ninstrument employed by them is constructed on the polarising principle\r\nas adapted by Zöllner.\r\n\r\nPhotographic photometry has meanwhile risen to an importance if anything\r\nexceeding that of visual photometry. For the usefulness of the great\r\ninternational star-chart now being prepared would be gravely compromised\r\nby systematic mistakes regarding the magnitudes of the stars registered\r\nupon it. No entirely trustworthy means of determining them have,\r\nhowever, yet been found. There is no certainty as to the relative times\r\nof exposure needed to get images of stars representative of successive\r\nphotometric ranks. All that can be done is to measure the proportionate\r\ndiameters of such images, and to infer, by the application of a law\r\nlearned from experience, the varied intensities of light to which they\r\ncorrespond. The law is, indeed, neither simple nor constant. Different\r\ninvestigators have arrived at different formulæ, which, being purely\r\nempirical, vary their nature with the conditions of experiment. Probably\r\nthe best expedient for overcoming the difficulty is that devised by\r\nPickering, of simultaneously photographing a star and its secondary\r\nimage, reduced in brightness by a known amount.[1611] The results of its\r\nuse will be exhibited in a catalogue of 40,000 stars to the tenth\r\nmagnitude, one for each square degree of the heavens. A photographic\r\nphotometry of all the lucid stars, modelled on the visual photometry of\r\n1884, is promised from the same copious source of novelties. The\r\nmagnitudes of the stars in the Draper Catalogue were determined, so to\r\nspeak, spectrographically. The quantity measured in all cases was the\r\nintensity of the hydrogen line near G. By the employment of this\r\ndefinite and uniform test, results were obtained, of special value\r\nindeed, but in strong disaccord with those given by less exclusive\r\ndeterminations.\r\n\r\nThought, meantime, cannot be held aloof from the great subject upon the\r\nfuture illustration of which so much patient industry is being expended.\r\nNor are partial glimpses denied to us of relations fully discoverable,\r\nperhaps, only through centuries of toil. Some important points in\r\ncosmical economy have, indeed, become quite clear within the last fifty\r\nyears, and scarcely any longer admit of a difference of opinion. One of\r\nthese is that of the true status of nebulæ.\r\n\r\nThis was virtually settled by Sir J. Herschel's description in 1847 of\r\nthe structure of the Magellanic clouds; but it was not until Whewell, in\r\n1853, and Herbert Spencer, in 1858,[1612] enforced the conclusions\r\nnecessarily to be derived therefrom that the conception of the nebulæ as\r\nremote galaxies, which Lord Rosse's resolution of many into stellar\r\npoints had appeared to support, began to withdraw into the region of\r\ndiscarded and half-forgotten speculations. In the Nubeculæ, as Whewell\r\ninsisted,[1613] \"there coexist, in a limited compass and in\r\nindiscriminate position, stars, clusters of stars, nebulæ, regular and\r\nirregular, and nebulous streaks and patches. These, then, are different\r\nkinds of things in themselves, not merely different to us. There are\r\nsuch things as nebulæ side by side with stars and with clusters of\r\nstars. Nebulous matter resolvable occurs close to nebulous matter\r\nirresolvable.\"\r\n\r\nThis argument from coexistence in nearly the same region of space,\r\nreiterated and reinforced with others by Mr. Spencer, was urged with his\r\naccustomed force and freshness by Mr. Proctor. It is unanswerable. There\r\nis no maintaining nebulæ to be simply remote worlds of stars in the face\r\nof an agglomeration like the Nubecula Major, containing in its\r\n(certainly capacious) bosom _both_ stars and nebulæ. Add the facts that\r\na considerable proportion of these perplexing objects are gaseous, and\r\nthat an intimate relation obviously subsists between the mode of their\r\nscattering and the lie of the Milky Way, and it becomes impossible to\r\nresist the conclusion that both nebular and stellar systems are parts of\r\na single scheme.[1614]\r\n\r\nAs to the stars themselves, the presumption of their approximate\r\nuniformity in size and brightness has been effectually dissipated.\r\nDifferences of distance can no longer be invoked to account for\r\ndissimilarity in lustre. Minute orbs, altogether invisible without\r\noptical aid, are found to be indefinitely nearer to us than such radiant\r\nobjects as Canopus, Betelgeux, or Rigel. Moreover, intensity of light is\r\nperceived to be a very imperfect index to real magnitude. Brilliant suns\r\nare swayed from their course by the attractive power of massive yet\r\nfaintly luminous companions, and suffer eclipse from obscure\r\ninterpositions. Besides, effective lustre is now known to depend no less\r\nupon the qualities of the investing atmosphere than upon the extent and\r\nradiative power of the stellar surface. Red stars must be far larger in\r\nproportion to the light diffused by them than white or yellow\r\nstars.[1615] There can be no doubt that our sun would at least double\r\nits brightness were the absorption suffered by its rays to be reduced to\r\nthe Sirian standard; and, on the other hand, that it would lose half its\r\npresent efficiency as a light-source if the atmosphere partially veiling\r\nits splendours were rendered as dense as that of Aldebaran.\r\n\r\nThus, variety of all kinds is seen to abound in the heavens; and it must\r\nbe admitted that the consequent insecurity of all hypotheses as to the\r\nrelative distances of individual stars singularly complicates the\r\nquestion of their allocation in space. Nevertheless, something has been\r\nlearnt even on that point; and the tendency of modern research is, on\r\nthe whole, strongly confirmatory of the views expressed by Herschel in\r\n1802. He then no longer regarded the Milky Way as the mere visual effect\r\nof an enormously extended stratum of stars, but as an actual\r\naggregation, highly irregular in structure, made up of stellar clouds\r\nand groups and nodosities. All the facts since ascertained fit in with\r\nthis conception, to which Proctor added arguments favouring the view,\r\nsince adopted by Barnard[1616] and Easton,[1617] that the stars forming\r\nthe galactic stream are not only situated more closely together, but are\r\nalso really, as well as apparently, of smaller dimensions than the lucid\r\norbs studding our skies. By the laborious process of isographically\r\ncharting the whole of Argelander's 324,000 stars, he brought out in\r\n1871[1618] signs of relationship between the distribution of the\r\nbrighter stars and the complex branchings of the Milky Way, which has\r\nbeen stamped as authentic by Newcomb's recent statistical\r\ninquiries.[1619] There is, besides, a marked condensation of stars,\r\nespecially in the southern hemisphere, towards a great circle inclined\r\nsome twenty degrees to the galactic plane; and these were supposed by\r\nGould to form with the sun a subordinate cluster, of which the\r\ncomponents are seen projected upon the sky as a zone of stellar\r\nbrilliants.[1620] The zone has, however, galactic rather than solar\r\naffinities, and represents, perhaps, not a group, but a stream.\r\n\r\nThe idea is gaining ground that the Milky Way is designed, in its main\r\noutlines, on a spiral pattern, and that its various branches and\r\nsections are consequently situated at very different distances from\r\nourselves. Proctor gave a preliminarily interpretation of their\r\ncomplexities on this principle, and Easton of Rotterdam[1621] has\r\nrenewed the attempt with better success.\r\n\r\nA most suggestive delineation of the Milky Way, completed in 1889, after\r\nfive years of labour, by Dr. Otto Boedicker, Lord Rosse's astronomer at\r\nParsonstown, was published by lithography in 1892. It showed a curiously\r\nintricate structure, composed of dimly luminous streams, and shreds, and\r\npatches, intermixed with dark gaps and channels. Ramifications from the\r\nmain trunk ran out towards the Andromeda nebula and the \"Bee-hive\"\r\ncluster in Cancer, involved the Pleiades and Hyades, and, winding round\r\nthe constellation of Orion, just attained the Sword-handle nebula. The\r\nlast delicate touches had scarcely been put to the picture, when the\r\nlaborious eye-and-hand method was, in this quarter, as already in so\r\nmany others, superseded by a more expeditious process. Professor Barnard\r\ntook the first photographs ever secured of the true Milky Way, July 28,\r\nAugust 1 and 2, 1889, at the Lick Observatory. Special conditions were\r\nrequired for success; above all, a wide field and a strong light-grasp,\r\nboth complied with through the use of a 6-inch portrait-lens. Even thus,\r\nthe sensitive plate needed some hours to pick out the exceedingly faint\r\nstars collected in the galactic clouds. These cannot be photographed\r\nunder the nebulous aspect they wear to the eye; the camera takes note of\r\ntheir real nature, and registers their constituent stars rank by rank.\r\nHence the difficulty of disclosing them. \"In the photographs made with\r\nthe 6-inch portrait-lens,\" Professor Barnard wrote, \"besides myriads of\r\nstars, there are shown, for the first time, the vast and wonderful\r\ncloud-forms, with all their remarkable structure of lanes, holes, and\r\nblack gaps, and sprays of stars. They present to us these forms in all\r\ntheir delicacy and beauty, as no eye or telescope can ever hope to see\r\nthem.\"[1622] In Plate VI. one of these strange galactic landscapes is\r\nreproduced. It occurs in the Bow of Sagittarius, not far from the Trifid\r\nnebula, where the aggregations of the Milky Way are more than usually\r\nvaried and characteristic. One of their distinctive features comes out\r\nwith particular prominence. It will be noticed that the bright mass near\r\nthe centre of the plate is tunnelled with dark holes and furrowed by\r\ndusky lanes. Such interruptions recur perpetually in the Milky Way. They\r\nare exemplified on the largest scale in the great rift dividing it into\r\ntwo branches all the way from Cygnus to Crux; and they are reproduced in\r\nminiature in many clusters.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE VI.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Region of the Milky Way in Sagittarius--showing a double\r\nblack aperture.\r\n\r\nPhotographed by Professor E. E. Barnard.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. H. C. Russell, at Sydney in 1890, successfully imitated Professor\r\nBarnard's example.[1623] His photographs of the southern Milky Way have\r\nmany points of interest. They show the great rift, black to the eye, yet\r\ndensely star-strewn to the perception of the chemical retina; while the\r\n\"Coal-sack\" appears absolutely dark only in its northern portion. His\r\nmost remarkable discovery, however, was that of the spiral character of\r\nthe two Nubeculæ. With an effective exposure of four and a half hours,\r\nthe Greater Cloud came out as \"a complex spiral, with two centres\";\r\nwhile the similar conformation of its minor companion developed only\r\nafter eight hours of persistent actinic action. The revelation is full\r\nof significance.\r\n\r\nScarcely less so, although after a different fashion, is the disclosure\r\non plates exposed by Dr. Max Wolf, with a 5-inch lens, in June, 1891, of\r\na vastly extended nebula, bringing some of the leading stars in Cygnus\r\ninto apparently organic connection with the piles of galactic star-dust\r\nlikewise involved by it.[1624] Barnard has similarly found great tracts\r\nof the Milky Way to be photographically nebulous, and the conclusion\r\nseems inevitable that we see in it a prodigious mixed system, resembling\r\nthat of the Pleiades in point of composition, though differing widely\r\nfrom it in plan of structure. Of corroborative testimony, moreover, is\r\nthe discovery independently resulting from Gill's and Pickering's\r\nphotographic reviews, that stars of the first type of spectrum largely\r\nprevail in the galactic zone of the heavens.[1625] With approach to that\r\nzone, Kapteyn noticed a steady growth of actinic intensity relative to\r\nvisual brightness in the stars depicted on the Cape Durchmusterung\r\nplates.[1626] In other words, stellar light is, in the Milky Way,\r\n_bluer_ than elsewhere. And the reality of the primitive character hence\r\nto be inferred for the entire structure was, in a manner, certified by\r\nMr. McClean's observation that Helium stars--the supposed immediate\r\nproducts of nebulous matter--crowd towards its medial plane.\r\n\r\nThe first step towards the unravelment of the tangled web of stellar\r\nmovements was taken when Herschel established the reality, and indicated\r\nthe direction of the sun's journey. But the gradual shifting backward of\r\nthe whole of the celestial scenery amid which we advance accounts for\r\nonly a part of the observed displacements. The stars have motions of\r\ntheir own besides those reflected upon them from ours. All attempts,\r\nhowever, to grasp the general scheme of these motions have hitherto\r\nfailed. Yet they have not remained wholly fruitless. The community of\r\nslow movement in Taurus, upon which Mädler based his famous theory, has\r\nproved to be a fact, and one of very extended significance.\r\n\r\nIn 1870 Mr. Proctor undertook to chart down the directions and\r\nproportionate amounts of about 1,600 proper motions, as determined by\r\nMessrs. Stone and Main, with the result of bringing to light the\r\nremarkable phenomenon termed by him \"star-drift.\"[1627] Quite\r\nunmistakably, large groups of stars, otherwise apparently disconnected,\r\nwere seen to be in progress together, in the same direction and at the\r\nsame rate, across the sky. An example of this kind of unanimity was\r\nalleged by him in the five intermediate stars of the Plough; and that\r\nthe agreement in thwartwise motion is no casual one is practically\r\ndemonstrated by the concordant radial velocities determined at Potsdam\r\nfor four out of the five objects in question. All of these approach the\r\nearth at the rate of about eighteen miles a second; and the fifth and\r\nfaintest, Delta Ursæ, though not yet measured, may be held to share\r\ntheir advance. One of them, moreover, Zeta Ursæ, alias Mizar,\r\ncarries with it three other stars--Alcor, the Arab \"Rider\" of the horse,\r\nvisible to the naked eye, besides a telescopic and a spectroscopic\r\nattendant. So that the group may be regarded as octuple. It is of vast\r\ncompass. Dr. Höffler assigned to it in 1897[1628]--although on grounds\r\nmore or less hypothetical--a mean parallax corresponding to a\r\nlight-journey of 192 years, which would give to the marching squadron a\r\ntotal extent of at least fourteen times the distance from the sun to\r\nAlpha Centauri, while implying for its brightest member--Eta\r\nUrsæ Majoris--the lustre of six hundred suns. The organising principle\r\nof this grand scheme must long remain mysterious.\r\n\r\nIt is no solitary example. Particular association, indeed--as was\r\nsurmised by Michell far back in the eighteenth century--appears to be\r\nthe rule rather than an exception in the sidereal system. Stars are\r\nbound together by twos, by threes, by dozens, by hundreds. Our own sun\r\nis, perhaps, not exempt from this gregarious tendency. Yet the search\r\nfor its companions has, up to the present, been unavailing. Gould's\r\ncluster[1629] seems remote and intangible; Kapteyn's collection of solar\r\nstars proved to have been a creation of erroneous data, and was\r\nabolished by his unrelenting industry. Rather, we appear to have secured\r\na compartment to ourselves for our long journey through space. A\r\npractical certainty has, at any rate, been gained that whatever\r\naggregation holds the sun as a constituent is of a far looser build than\r\nthe Pleiades or Præsepe. Of all such majestic communities the laws and\r\nrevolutions remain, as yet, inaccessible to inquiry; centuries may\r\nelapse before even a rudimentary acquaintance with them begins to\r\ndevelop; while the economy of the higher order of association, which we\r\nmust reasonably believe that they unite to compose, will possibly\r\ncontinue to stimulate and baffle human curiosity to the end of time.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1369: _Report Brit.

The telescope has been supplemented by the\r\nspectroscope and the photographic camera. Now, this really involves a\r\nwhole world of change. It means that astronomy has left the place where\r\nshe dwelt apart in rapt union with mathematics, indifferent to all\r\nthings on earth save only to those mechanical improvements which should\r\naid her to penetrate further into the heavens, and has descended into\r\nthe forum of human knowledge, at once a suppliant and a patron,\r\nalternately invoking help from and promising it to each of the sciences,\r\nand patiently waiting upon the advances of all. The science of the\r\nheavenly bodies has, in a word, become a branch of terrestrial physics,\r\nor rather a higher kind of integration of all their results. It has,\r\nhowever, this leading peculiarity, that the materials for the whole of\r\nits inquiries are telescopically furnished. They are such as come very\r\nimperfectly, or not at all, within the cognisance of the unarmed eye.\r\n\r\nSpectroscopic and photographic apparatus are simply additions to the\r\ntelescope. They do not supersede or render it of less importance. On the\r\ncontrary, the efficacy of their action depends primarily upon the\r\noptical qualities of the instruments they are attached to. Hence the\r\ndevelopment, to their fullest extent, of the powers of the telescope is\r\nof vital moment to the progress of modern physical astronomy, while the\r\nolder mathematical astronomy could afford to remain comparatively\r\nindifferent to it.\r\n\r\nThe colossal Rosse reflector still marks, as to size, the _ne plus\r\nultra_ of performance in that line. A mirror four feet in diameter was,\r\nhowever, sent out to Melbourne by the late Thomas Grubb of Dublin in\r\n1870. This is mounted in the Cassegrainian manner, so that the observer\r\nlooks straight through it towards the object viewed, of which he really\r\nsees a twice-reflected image. The dust-laden atmosphere of Melbourne is\r\nsaid to impede very seriously the usefulness of this originally fine\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\nIt may be doubted whether so large a spectrum will ever again be\r\nconstructed. A new material for the mirrors of reflecting telescopes,\r\nproposed by Steinheil in 1856, and independently by Foucault in\r\n1857,[1630] has in a great measure superseded the use of a metallic\r\nalloy. This is glass upon which a thin film of silver has been deposited\r\nby a chemical process originally invented by Liebig. It gives a\r\npeculiarly brilliant reflective surface, throwing back more light than a\r\nmetallic mirror of the same area, in the proportion of about sixteen to\r\nnine. Resilvering, too, involves much less risk and trouble than\r\nrepolishing a speculum. The first use of this plan on a large scale was\r\nin an instrument of thirty-six inches aperture, finished by Calver for\r\nDr. Common in 1879. To its excellent qualities turned to account with\r\nrare skill, his triumphs in celestial photography are mainly due. A more\r\ndaring experiment was the construction and mounting, by Dr. Common\r\nhimself, of a 5-foot reflector. But the first glass disc ordered from\r\nFrance for the purpose proved radically defective. When figured,\r\npolished, and silvered, towards the close of 1888, it gave elliptical\r\ninstead of circular star-images.[1631] A new one had to be procured, and\r\nwas ready for astronomical use in 1891. The satisfactory nature of its\r\nperformance is vouched for by the observations made with it upon\r\nJupiter's new satellite in December, 1892. This instrument, to which a\r\nNewtonian form has been given, had no rival in respect of\r\nlight-concentration at the time when it was built. It has now two--the\r\nParis 50-inch refractor and the Yerkes 5-foot reflector.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, in the construction of refracting telescopes that the\r\nmost conspicuous advances have recently been made. The Harvard College\r\n15-inch achromatic was mounted and ready for work in June, 1847. A\r\nsimilar instrument had already for some years been in its place at\r\nPulkowa. It was long before the possibility of surpassing these\r\nmasterpieces of German skill presented itself to any optician. For\r\nfifteen years it seemed as if a line had been drawn just there. It was\r\nfirst transgressed in America. A portrait-painter of Cambridgeport,\r\nMassachusetts, named Alvan Clark, had for some time amused his leisure\r\nwith grinding lenses, the singular excellence of which was discovered in\r\nEngland by Mr. Dawes in 1853.[1632] Seven years passed, and then an\r\norder came from the University of Mississippi for an object-glass of the\r\nunexampled size of eighteen inches. An experimental glance through it to\r\ntest its definition resulted, as we have seen, in the detection of the\r\ncompanion of Sirius, January 31, 1862. It never reached its destination\r\nin the South. War troubles supervened, and it was eventually sent to\r\nChicago, where it served Professor Hough in his investigations of\r\nJupiter, and Mr. Burnham in his scrutiny of double stars.\r\n\r\nThe next step was an even longer one, and it was again taken by a\r\nself-taught optician, Thomas Cooke, the son of a shoemaker at\r\nAllerthorpe, in the East Riding of Yorkshire. Mr. Newall of Gateshead\r\nordered from him in 1863 a 25-inch object-glass. It was finished early\r\nin 1868, but at the cost of shortening the life of its maker, who died\r\nOctober 19, 1868, before the giant refractor he had toiled at for five\r\nyears was completely mounted. This instrument, the fine qualities of\r\nwhich had long been neutralized by an unfavourable situation, was\r\npresented by Mr. Newall to the University of Cambridge, a few weeks\r\nbefore his death, April 21, 1889. Under the care of his son, Mr. Frank\r\nNewall, it has proved highly efficient in the delicate work of measuring\r\nstellar radial motions.\r\n\r\nClose upon its construction followed that of the Washington 26-inch, for\r\nwhich twenty thousand dollars were paid to Alvan Clark. The most\r\nillustrious point in its career, entered upon in 1873, has been the\r\ndiscovery of the satellites of Mars. Once known to be there, these were,\r\nindeed, found to be perceptible with very moderate optical means (Mr.\r\nWentworth Erck saw Deimos with a 7-inch Clark); but the first detection\r\nof such minute objects is a feat of a very different order from their\r\nsubsequent observation. Dr. See's perception with this instrument, in\r\n1899, of Neptune's cloud-belts, and his refined series of micrometrical\r\nmeasures of the various planets, attest the unimpaired excellence of its\r\noptical qualities.\r\n\r\nIt held the primacy for more than eight years. Then, in December, 1880,\r\nthe place of honour had to be yielded to a 27-inch achromatic, built by\r\nHoward Grubb (son and successor of Thomas Grubb) for the Vienna\r\nObservatory. This, in its turn, was surpassed by two of respectively\r\n29-1/2 and 30 inches, sent by Gautier of Paris to Nice, and by Alvan\r\nClark to Pulkowa; and an object-glass, three feet in diameter, was in\r\n1886 successfully turned out by the latter firm for the Lick Observatory\r\nin California. The difficulties, however, encountered in procuring discs\r\nof glass of the size and purity required for this last venture seemed to\r\nindicate that a term to progress in this direction was not far off. The\r\nflint was, indeed, cast with comparative ease in the workshops of M.\r\nFeil at Paris. The flawless mass weighed 170 kilogrammes, was over 38\r\ninches across, and cost 10,000 dollars. But with the crown part of the\r\ndesigned achromatic combination things went less smoothly. The\r\nproduction of a perfect disc was only achieved after _nineteen_\r\nfailures, involving a delay of more than two years; and the glass for a\r\nthird lens, designed to render the telescope available at pleasure for\r\nphotographic purposes, proved to be strained, and consequently went to\r\npieces in the process of grinding. It has been replaced by one of 33\r\ninches, with which a series of admirable lunar and other photographs\r\nhave been taken.\r\n\r\nNor is the difficulty in obtaining suitable material the only obstacle\r\nto increasing the size of refractors. The \"secondary spectrum,\" as it is\r\ncalled, also interposes a barrier troublesome to surmount. True\r\nachromatism cannot be obtained with ordinary flint and crown-glass; and\r\nalthough in lenses of \"Jena glass,\" outstanding colour is reduced to\r\nabout one-sixth its usual amount, their term of service is fatally\r\nabridged by rapid deterioration. Nevertheless, a 13-inch objective of\r\nthe new variety was mounted at Königsberg in 1898; and discs of Jena\r\ncrown and flint, 23 inches across, were purchased by Brashear at the\r\nChicago Exhibition of 1893. An achromatic combination of three kinds of\r\nglass, devised by Mr. A. Taylor[1633] for Messrs. Cooke of York, has\r\nless serious drawbacks, but has not yet come into extensive use.\r\nMeanwhile, in giant telescopes affected to the full extent by chromatic\r\naberration, such as the Lick and Yerkes refractors, the differences of\r\nfocal length for the various colours are counted by inches,[1634] and\r\nthis not through any lack of skill in the makers, but by the necessity\r\nof the case. Embarrassing consequences follow. Only a small part of the\r\nspectrum of a heavenly body, for instance, can be distinctly seen at one\r\ntime; and a focal adjustment of half an inch is required in passing from\r\nthe observation of a planetary nebula to that of its stellar nucleus. A\r\nrefracting telescope loses, besides, one of its chief advantages over a\r\nreflector when its size is increased beyond a certain limit. That\r\nadvantage is the greater luminosity of the images given by it.\r\nConsiderably more light is transmitted through a glass lens than is\r\nreflected from an equal metallic surface. But only so long as both are\r\nof moderate dimensions. For the glass necessarily grows in thickness as\r\nits area augments, and consequently stops a larger percentage of the\r\nrays it refracts. So that a point at length arrives--fixed by the late\r\nDr. Robinson at a diameter a little short of 3 feet[1635]--where the\r\nglass and the metal are, in this respect, on an equality; while above it\r\nthe metal has the advantage. And since silvered glass gives back\r\nconsiderably more light than speculum metal, the stage of equalisation\r\nwith lenses is reached proportionately sooner where this material is\r\nemployed.[1636]\r\n\r\nThe most distinctive faculty of reflectors, however, is that of bringing\r\nrays of all refrangibilities to a focus together. They are naturally\r\nachromatic. None of the beams they collect are thrown away in\r\ncolour-fringes, obnoxious both in themselves and as a waste of the chief\r\nobject of astrophysicists' greed--light. Reflectors, then, are in this\r\nrespect specially adapted to photographic and spectrographic use. But\r\nthey have a countervailing drawback. The penalties imposed by bigness\r\nare for them peculiarly heavy. Perfect definition becomes with\r\nincreasing size, more and more difficult to attain; once attained, it\r\nbecomes more and more difficult to keep. For the huge masses of material\r\nemployed to form great object-glasses or mirrors tend with every\r\nmovement to become deformed by their own weight. Now, the slightest\r\nbending of a mirror is fatal to its performance, the effect being\r\ndoubled by reflection; while in a lens alteration of figure is\r\ncompensated by the equal and contrary flexures of the opposing surfaces,\r\nso that the emergent beams pursue much the same paths as if the curves\r\nof the refracting medium had remained theoretically perfect. For this\r\nreason work of precision must remain the province of refracting\r\ntelescopes, although great reflectors retain the primacy in the\r\nportraiture of the heavenly bodies, as well as in certain branches of\r\nspectroscopy. Professor Hale, accordingly, summarised a valuable\r\ndiscussion on the subject by asserting[1637] \"that the astrophysicist\r\nmay properly consider the reflector to be an even more important part of\r\nhis instrumental equipment than the refractor.\" A new era in its\r\nemployment west of the Atlantic opened with the transfer from Halifax to\r\nMount Hamilton of the Crossley reflector. Its prerogatives in nebular\r\nphotography were splendidly indicated in 1899 by Professor Keeler's\r\nexquisite and searching portrayals of the cloud-worlds of space, and\r\nthose obtained two years later, with a similar, though smaller,\r\ninstrument, by Professor Ritchey of the Yerkes Observatory, were fully\r\ncomparable with them. The performances of the Yerkes 5-foot reflector\r\nstill belong to the future.\r\n\r\nAmbition as regards telescopic power is by no means yet satisfied. Nor\r\nought it to be. The advance of astrophysical researches of all kinds\r\ndepends largely upon light-grasp. For the spectroscopic examination of\r\nstars, for the measurement of their motions in the line of sight, for\r\nthe discovery and study of nebulæ, for stellar and nebular photography,\r\nthe cry continually is \"more light.\" There is no enterprising head of an\r\nobservatory but must feel cramped in his designs if he can command no\r\nmore than 14 or 15 inches of aperture, and he aspires to greater\r\ninstrumental capacity, not merely with a view to the chances of\r\ndiscovery, but for the steady prosecution of some legitimate line of\r\ninquiry. Thus projects of telescope-building on a large scale are rife,\r\nand some obtain realisation year by year. Sir Howard Grubb finished in\r\n1893 a 28-inch achromatic for the Royal Observatory, Greenwich; the\r\nThompson equatoreal, mounted at the same establishment in 1897, carries\r\non a single axis a 26-inch photographic refractor and a 30-inch\r\nsilvered-glass reflector; the Victoria telescope, inaugurated at the\r\nCape in 1901, comprises a powerful spectrographic apparatus, together\r\nwith a chemically corrected 24-inch refractor, the whole being the\r\nmunificent gift of Mr. Frank McClean; at Potsdam, at Meudon, at Paris,\r\nat Alleghany, engines for light-concentration have been, or shortly will\r\nbe, erected of dimensions which, two generations back, would have seemed\r\nextravagant and impossible.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the finest, though not absolutely the greatest, among them,\r\nmarked the summit and end of the performances of Alvan G. Clark, the\r\nlast survivor of the Cambridgeport firm.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1892, Mr. Yerkes of Chicago offered an unlimited sum for the\r\nprovision of the University of that city with a \"superlative\" telescope.\r\nAnd it happened, fortunately, that a pair of glass discs, nearly 42\r\ninches in diameter, and of perfect quality, were ready at hand. They had\r\nbeen cast by Mantois for the University of Southern California, when the\r\nerection of a great observatory on Wilson's Peak was under\r\nconsideration. In the Clark workshop they were combined into a superb\r\nobjective, brought to perfection by trials and delicate touches\r\nextending over nearly five years. Then the maker accompanied it to its\r\ndestination, by the shore of a far Western Lake Geneva, and died\r\nimmediately after his return, June 9, 1897. Nor has the implement of\r\ncelestial research he just lived to complete been allowed to \"rust\r\nunburnished.\" Manipulated by Hale, Burnham, and Barnard, it has done\r\nwork that would have been impracticable with less efficient optical aid.\r\nIts construction thus marks a noticeable enlargement of astronomical\r\npossibilities, exemplified--to cite one among many performances--by\r\nBarnard's success in keeping track of cluster-variables when below the\r\ncommon limit of visual perception.\r\n\r\nWith the Lick telescope results have also been achieved testifying to\r\nits unsurpassed excellence. Holden's and Schaeberle's views of planetary\r\nnebulæ, Burnham's and Hussey's hair's-breadth star-splitting operations,\r\nKeeler's measurements of nebular radial motion, Barnard's detections and\r\nprolonged pursuit of faint comets, his discovery of Jupiter's tiny moon,\r\nCampbell's spectroscopic determinations--all this could only have been\r\naccomplished, even by an exceptionally able and energetic staff, with\r\nthe aid of an instrument of high power and quality. But there was\r\nanother condition which should not be overlooked.\r\n\r\nThe best telescope may be crippled by a bad situation. The larger it is,\r\nindeed, the more helpless is it to cope with atmospheric troubles. These\r\nare the worst plagues of all those that afflict the astronomer. No\r\nmechanical skill avails to neutralise or alleviate them. They augment\r\nwith each increase of aperture; they grow with the magnifying powers\r\napplied. The rays from the heavenly bodies, when they can penetrate the\r\ncloud-veils that too often bar their path, reach us in an enfeebled,\r\nscattered, and disturbed condition. Hence the twinkling of stars, the\r\n\"boiling\" effects at the edges of sun, moon, and planets; hence\r\ndistortions of bright, effacements of feeble telescopic images; hence,\r\ntoo, the paucity of the results obtained with many powerful\r\nlight-gathering machines.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the Parsonstown telescope been built than it became\r\nobvious that the limit of profitable augmentation of size had, under\r\nclimatic conditions at all nearly resembling those prevailing there,\r\nbeen reached, if not overpassed; and Lord Rosse himself was foremost to\r\ndiscern the need of pausing to look round the world for a clearer and\r\nstiller air than was to be found within the bounds of the United\r\nKingdom. With this express object Mr. Lassell transported his 2-foot\r\nNewtonian to Malta in 1852, and mounted there, in 1860, a similar\r\ninstrument of fourfold capacity, with which, in the course of about two\r\nyears, 600 new nebulæ were discovered. Professor Piazzi Smyth's\r\nexperiences during a trip to the Peak of Teneriffe in 1856 in search of\r\nastronomical opportunities[1638] gave countenance to the most sanguine\r\nhopes of deliverance, at suitable elevated stations, from some of the\r\noppressive conditions of low-level star-gazing; yet for a number of\r\nyears nothing effectual was done for their realisation. Now, at last,\r\nhowever, mountain observatories are not only an admitted necessity but\r\nan accomplished fact; and Newton's long forecast of a time when\r\nastronomers would be compelled, by the developed powers of their\r\ntelescopes, to mount high above the \"grosser clouds\" in order to use\r\nthem,[1639] had been justified by the event.\r\n\r\nJames Lick, the millionaire of San Francisco, had already chosen, when\r\nhe died, October 1, 1876, a site for the new observatory, to the\r\nbuilding and endowment of which he had devoted a part of his large\r\nfortune. The situation of the establishment is exceptional and splendid.\r\nPlanted on one of the three peaks of Mount Hamilton, a crowning summit\r\nof the Californian Coast Range, at an elevation of 4,200 feet above the\r\nsea, in a climate scarce rivalled throughout the world, it commands\r\nviews both celestial and terrestrial which the lover of nature and\r\nastronomy may alike rejoice in. Impediments to observation are there\r\nfound to be most materially reduced. Professor Holden, who was\r\nappointed, in 1885, president of the University of California and\r\ndirector of the new observatory affiliated to it, stated that during six\r\nor seven months of the year an unbroken serenity prevails, and that half\r\nthe remaining nights are clear.[1640] The power of continuous work thus\r\nafforded is of itself an inestimable advantage; and the high visual\r\nexcellences testified to by Mr. Burnham's discovery, during a two\r\nmonths' trip to Mount Hamilton in the autumn of 1879, of forty-two new\r\ndouble stars with a 6-inch achromatic, gave hopes since fully realised\r\nof a brilliant future for the Lick establishment. Its advantages are\r\nshared, as Professor Holden desired them to be, by the whole\r\nastronomical world.[1641] A sort of appellate jurisdiction was at once\r\naccorded to the great equatoreal, and more than one disputed point has\r\nbeen satisfactorily settled by recourse to it.\r\n\r\nIts performances, considered both as to quality and kind, are unlikely\r\nto be improved upon by merely outbidding it in size, unless the care\r\nexpended upon the selection of its site be imitated. Professor Pickering\r\nthus showed his customary prudence in reserving his efforts to procure a\r\ngreat telescope until Harvard College owned a dependent observatory\r\nwhere it could be employed to advantage. This was found by Mr. W. H.\r\nPickering, after many experiments in Colorado, California, and Peru, at\r\nArequipa, on a slope of the Andes, 8,000 feet above the sea-level. Here\r\nthe post provided for by the \"Boyden Fund\" was established in 1891,\r\nunder ideal meteorological conditions. Temperature preserves a \"golden\r\nmean\"; the barometer is almost absolutely steady; the yearly rainfall\r\namounts to no more than three or four inches. No wonder, then, that the\r\n\"seeing\" there is of the extraordinary excellence attested by Mr.\r\nPickering's observations. In the absence of bright moonlight, he tells\r\nus,[1642] eleven Pleiades can always be counted; the Andromeda nebula\r\nappears to the naked eye conspicuously bright, and larger than the full\r\nmoon; third magnitude stars have been followed to their disappearance at\r\nthe true horizon; the zodiacal light spans the heavens as a complete\r\narch, the \"Gegenschein\" forming a regular part of the scenery of the\r\nheavens. Corresponding telescopic facilities are enjoyed. The chief\r\ninstrument at the station, a 13-inch equatoreal by Clark, shows the\r\nfainter parts of the Orion nebula, photographed at Harvard College in\r\n1887, by which the dimensions given to it in Bond's drawing are doubled;\r\nstars are at times seen encircled by half a dozen immovable diffraction\r\nrings, up to twelve of which have been counted round Alpha Centauri;\r\nwhile on many occasions no available increase of magnifying power\r\navailed to bring out any wavering in the limbs of the planets. Moreover,\r\nthe series of fine nights is nearly unbroken from March to November.\r\n\r\nThe facilities thus offered for continuous photographic research\r\nrendered feasible Professor Bailey's amazing discovery of variable\r\nstar-clusters. They belong exclusively to the \"globular\" class, and the\r\npeculiarity is most strikingly apparent in the groups known as\r\nOmega Centauri, and Messier 3, 5, and 15. A large number of their minute\r\ncomponents run through perfectly definite cycles of change in periods\r\nusually of a few hours.[1643] Altogether, about 500 \"cluster-variables\"\r\nhave been recorded since 1895. It should be mentioned that Mr. David\r\nPacker and Dr. Common discerned, about 1890, some premonitory symptoms\r\nof light-fluctuation among the crowded stars of Messier 5.[1644] With\r\nthe Bruce telescope, a photographic doublet 24 inches in diameter, a\r\nstore of 5,686 negatives was collected at Arequipa between 1896 and\r\n1901. Some were exposed directly, others with the intervention of a\r\nprism; and all are available for important purposes of detection or\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nVapours and air-currents do not alone embarrass the use of giant\r\ntelescopes. Mechanical difficulties also oppose a formidable barrier to\r\nmuch further growth in size. But what seems a barrier often proves to be\r\nonly a fresh starting-point; and signs are not wanting that it may be\r\nfound so in this case. It is possible that the monumental domes and huge\r\nmovable tubes of our present observatories will, in a few decades, be as\r\nmuch things of the past as Huygens's \"aerial\" telescopes. It is certain\r\nthat the thin edge of the wedge of innovation has been driven into the\r\nold plan of equatoreal mounting.\r\n\r\nM. Loewy, the present director of the Paris Observatory, proposed to\r\nDelaunay in 1871 the direction of a telescope on a novel system. The\r\ndesign seemed feasible, and was adopted; but the death of Delaunay and\r\nthe other untoward circumstances of the time interrupted its execution.\r\nIts resumption, after some years, was rendered possible by M.\r\nBischoffsheim's gift of 25,000 francs for expenses, and the _coudé_ or\r\n\"bent\" equatoreal has been, since 1882, one of the leading instruments\r\nat the Paris establishment.\r\n\r\nIts principle is briefly this: The telescope is, as it were, its own\r\npolar axis. The anterior part of the tube is supported at both ends, and\r\nis thus fixed in a direction pointing towards the pole, with only the\r\npower of twisting axially. The posterior section is joined on to it at\r\nright angles, and presents the object-glass, accordingly, to the\r\ncelestial equator, in the plane of which it revolves. Stars in any other\r\npart of the heavens have their beams reflected upon the object-glass by\r\nmeans of a plane rotating mirror placed in front of it. The observer,\r\nmeanwhile, is looking steadfastly down the bent tube towards the\r\ninvisible _southern_ pole. He would naturally see nothing whatever were\r\nit not that a second plane mirror is fixed at the \"elbow\" of the\r\ninstrument, so as to send the rays which have traversed the object-glass\r\nto his eye. He never needs to move from his place. He watches the stars,\r\nseated in an arm-chair in a warm room, with as perfect convenience as if\r\nhe were examining the seeds of a fungus with a microscope. Nor is this a\r\nmere gain of personal ease. The abolition of hardship includes a vast\r\naccession of power.[1645]\r\n\r\nAmong other advantages of this method of construction are, first, that\r\nof added stability, the motion given to the ordinary equatoreal being\r\ntransferred, in part, to an auxiliary mirror. Next, that of increased\r\nfocal length. The fixed part of the tube can be made almost indefinitely\r\nlong without inconvenience, and with enormous advantage to the optical\r\nqualities of a large instrument. Finally, the costly and unmanageable\r\ncupola is got rid of, a mere shed serving all purposes of protection\r\nrequired for the \"coudé.\"\r\n\r\nThe desirability of some such change as that which M. Loewy has realised\r\nhas been felt by others. Professor Pickering sketched, in 1881, a plan\r\nfor fixing large refractors in a permanently horizontal position, and\r\nreflecting into them, by means of a shifting mirror, the objects desired\r\nto be observed.[1646] The observations for his photometric catalogues\r\nare, in fact, made with a \"broken transit,\" in which the line of sight\r\nremains permanently horizontal, whatever the altitude of the star\r\nexamined. Sir Howard Grubb, moreover, set up, in 1882, a kind of\r\nsiderostat at the Crawford Observatory, Cork. In a paper read before the\r\nRoyal Society, January 21, 1884, he proposed to carry out the principle\r\non a more extended scale;[1647] and shortly afterwards undertook its\r\napplication to a telescope 18 inches in aperture for the Armagh\r\nObservatory.[1648] The chief honours, however, remain to the Paris\r\ninventor. None of the prognosticated causes of failure have proved\r\neffective. The loss of light from the double reflection is\r\ninsignificant. The menaced deformation of images is, through the\r\nexquisite skill of the MM. Henry in producing plane mirrors of all but\r\nabsolute perfection, quite imperceptible. The definition was admitted to\r\nbe singularly good. Sir David Gill stated in 1884 that he had never\r\nmeasured a double star so easily as he did Gamma Leonis by its\r\nmeans.[1649] Sir Norman Lockyer pronounced it to be \"one of the\r\ninstruments of the future\"; and the principle of its construction was\r\nimmediately adopted by the directors of the Besançon and Algiers\r\nObservatories, as well as for a 17-inch telescope destined for a new\r\nobservatory at Buenos Ayres. At Paris, it has since been carried out on\r\na larger scale. A \"coudé,\" of 23-1/2 inches aperture and 62 feet focal\r\nlength was in 1890 installed at the National Observatory, and has served\r\nM. Loewy for his ingenious studies on refraction and aberration--above\r\nall, for taking the magnificent plates of his lunar atlas. The \"bent\"\r\nform is capable of being, but has not yet been, adapted to\r\nreflectors.[1650]\r\n\r\nThe \"coelostat,\" in the form given to it by Professor Turner, has\r\nproved an invaluable adjunct to eclipse-equipments. It consists\r\nessentially of a mirror rotating in forty-eight hours on an axis in its\r\nown plane, and parallel to the earth's axis. In the field of a telescope\r\nkept rigidly pointed towards such a mirror, stars appear immovably\r\nfixed. The employment of long-focus lenses for coronal photography is\r\nthus facilitated, and the size of the image is proportional to the\r\nlength of the focus. Professor Barnard, accordingly, depicted the\r\ntotality of 1900 with a horizontal telescope 61-1/2 feet long, fed by a\r\nmirror 18 inches across, the diameter of the moon on his plates being 7\r\ninches. The largest siderostat in the world is the Paris 50-inch\r\nrefractor, which formed the chief attraction of the Palais d'Optique at\r\nthe Exhibition of 1900. It has a focal length of nearly 200 feet, and\r\ncan be used either for photographic or for visual purposes.\r\n\r\nCelestial photography has not reached its grand climacteric; yet its\r\nearliest beginnings already seem centuries behind its present\r\nperformances. The details of its gradual yet rapid improvement are of\r\ntoo technical a nature to find a place in these pages. Suffice it to say\r\nthat the \"dry-plate\" process, with which such wonderful results have\r\nbeen obtained, appears to have been first made available by Sir William\r\nHuggins in photographing the spectrum of Vega in 1876, and was then\r\nsuccessively adopted by Common, Draper, and Janssen. Nor should Captain\r\nAbney's remarkable extension of the powers of the camera be left\r\nunnoticed. He began his experiments on the chemical action of red and\r\ninfra-red rays in 1874, and at length succeeded in obtaining a\r\nsubstance--the \"blue\" bromide of silver--highly sensitive to these\r\nslower vibrations of light. With its aid he explored a vast, unknown,\r\nand for ever invisible region of the solar spectrum, presenting to the\r\nRoyal Society, December 5, 1879,[1651] a detailed map of its infra-red\r\nportion (wave-lengths 7,600 to 10,750), from which valuable inferences\r\nmay yet be derived as to the condition of the various kinds of matter\r\nignited in the solar atmosphere. Upon plates rendered \"orthochromatic\"\r\nby staining with alizarine, or other dye-stuffs, the whole visible\r\nspectrum can now be photographed; but those with their maximum of\r\nsensitiveness near G are found preferable, except where the results of\r\nlight-analysis are sought to be completely recorded. And since\r\nphotographic refractors are corrected for the blue rays, exposures with\r\nthem of orthochromatic surfaces would be entirely futile.\r\n\r\nThe chemical plate has two advantages over the human retina:[1652]\r\nFirst, it is sensitive to rays which are utterly powerless to produce\r\nany visual effect; next, it can accumulate impression almost\r\nindefinitely, while from the retina they fade after one-tenth part of a\r\nsecond, leaving it a continually renewed _tabula rasa_.\r\n\r\nIt is, accordingly, quite possible to photograph objects so faint as to\r\nbe altogether beyond the power of any telescope to reveal--witness the\r\nchemical disclosure of the invisible nebula encircling Nova Persei--and\r\nwe may thus eventually learn whether a blank space in the sky truly\r\nrepresents the end of the stellar universe in that direction, or whether\r\nfarther and farther worlds roll and shine beyond, veiled in the\r\nobscurity of immeasurable distance.\r\n\r\nOf many ingenious improvements in spectroscopic appliances the most\r\nfundamentally important relate to what are known as \"gratings.\" These\r\nare very finely striated surfaces, by which light-waves are brought to\r\ninterfere, and are thus sifted out, strictly according to their\r\ndifferent lengths, into \"normal\" spectra. Since no universally valid\r\nmeasures can be made in any others, their production is quite\r\nindispensable to spectroscopic science. Fraunhofer, who initiated the\r\nstudy of the diffraction spectrum, used a real grating of very fine\r\nwires: but rulings on glass were adopted by his successors, and were by\r\nNobert executed with such consummate skill that a single square inch of\r\nsurface was made to contain 100,000 hand-drawn lines. Such rare and\r\ncostly triumphs of art, however, found their way into very few hands,\r\nand practical availability was first given to this kind of instrument by\r\nthe inventiveness and mechanical dexterity of two American\r\ninvestigators. Both Rutherfurd's and Rowland's gratings are\r\nmachine-ruled, and reflect instead of transmitting the rays they\r\nanalyse; but Rowland's present to them a very much larger diffractive\r\nsurface, and consequently possess a higher resolving power. The first\r\npreliminary to his improvements was the production, in 1882, of a\r\nfaultless screw, those previously in use having been the inevitable\r\nsource of periodical errors in striation, giving, in their turn,\r\nghost-lines as subjects of spectroscopic study.[1653] Their abolition\r\nwas not one of Rowland's least achievements. With his perfected machine\r\na metallic area of 6-1/4 by 4-1/4 inches can be ruled with exquisite\r\naccuracy to almost any degree of fineness; he considered, however,\r\n43,000 lines to the inch to be the limit of usefulness.[1654] The ruled\r\nsurface is, moreover, concave, and hence brings the spectrum to a focus\r\nwithout a telescope. A slit and an eye-piece are alone needed to view\r\nit, and absorption of light by glass lenses is obviated--an advantage\r\nespecially sensible in dealing with the ultra- or infra-visible rays.\r\n\r\nThe high qualities of Rowland's great photographic map of the solar\r\nspectrum were thus based upon his previous improvement of the\r\ninstrumental means used in its execution. The amount of detail shown in\r\nit is illustrated by the appearance on the negatives of 150 lines\r\nbetween H and K; and many lines depict themselves as double which, until\r\nexamined with a concave grating, had passed for one and indivisible. A\r\ncorresponding hand-drawing, for which M. Thollon received in 1886 the\r\nLalande Prize, exhibits, not the diffractive, but the prismatic spectrum\r\nas obtained with bisulphide of carbon prisms of large dispersive power.\r\nAbout one-third of the visible gamut of the solar radiations (A to _b_)\r\nis covered by it; it includes 3,200 lines, and is over ten metres\r\nlong.[1655] The grating is an expensive tool in the way of light. Where\r\nthere is none to spare, its advantages must be foregone. They could not,\r\naccordingly, be turned to account in stellar spectroscopy until the Lick\r\ntelescope was at hand to supply more abundant material for research. By\r\nthe use thus made possible of Rowland's gratings, Professor Keeler was\r\nable to apply enormous dispersion to the rays of stars and nebulæ, and\r\nso to attain a previously unheard-of degree of accuracy in their\r\nmeasurement. His memorable detection of nebular movement in line of\r\nsight ensued as a consequence. Professor Campbell, his successor, has\r\nsince obtained, by the same means, the first satisfactory photographs of\r\nstellar diffraction-spectra.\r\n\r\nThe means at the disposal of astronomers have not multiplied faster than\r\nthe tasks imposed upon them. Looking back to the year 1800, we cannot\r\nfail to be astonished at the change. The comparatively simple and serene\r\nscience of the heavenly bodies known to our predecessors, almost perfect\r\nso far as it went, incurious of what lay beyond its grasp, has developed\r\ninto a body of manifold powers and parts, each with its separate mode\r\nand means of growth, full of strong vitality, but animated by a restless\r\nand unsatisfied spirit, haunted by the sense of problems unsolved, and\r\ntormented by conscious impotence to sound the immensities it perpetually\r\nconfronts.\r\n\r\nKnowledge might be said, when the _Mécanique Céleste_ issued from the\r\npress, to be bounded by the solar system; but even the solar system\r\npresented itself under an aspect strangely different from what it now\r\nwears. It consisted of the sun, seven planets, and twice as many\r\nsatellites, all circling harmoniously in obedience to a universal law,\r\nby the compensating action of which the indefinite stability of their\r\nmutual relations was secured. The occasional incursion of a comet, or\r\nthe periodical presence of a single such wanderer chained down from\r\nescape to outer space by planetary attraction, availed nothing to impair\r\nthe symmetry of the majestic spectacle.\r\n\r\nNow, not alone the ascertained limits of the system have been widened by\r\na thousand millions of miles, with the addition of one more giant planet\r\nand seven satellites to the ancient classes of its members, but a\r\ncomplexity has been given to its constitution baffling description or\r\nthought. Five hundred circulating planetary bodies bridge the gap\r\nbetween Jupiter and Mars, the complete investigation of the movements of\r\nany one of which would overtask the energies of a lifetime. Meteorites,\r\nstrangers, apparently, to the fundamental ordering of the solar\r\nhousehold, swarm, nevertheless, by millions in every cranny of its\r\nspace, returning at regular intervals like the comets so singularly\r\nassociated with them, or sweeping across it with hyperbolic velocities,\r\nbrought, perhaps, from some distant star. And each of these cosmical\r\ngrains of dust has a theory far more complex than that of Jupiter; it\r\nbears within it the secret of its origin, and fulfils a function in the\r\nuniverse. The sun itself is no longer a semi-fabulous, fire-girt globe,\r\nbut the vast scene of the play of forces as yet imperfectly known to us,\r\noffering a boundless field for the most arduous and inspiring\r\nresearches. Among the planets the widest variety in physical habitudes\r\nis seen to prevail, and each is recognised as a world apart, inviting\r\ninquiries which, to be effective, must necessarily be special and\r\ndetailed. Even our own moon threatens to break loose from the trammels\r\nof calculation, and commits \"errors\" which sap the very foundations of\r\nthe lunar theory, and suggest the formidable necessity for its complete\r\nrevision. Nay, the steadfast earth has forfeited the implicit confidence\r\nplaced in it as a time-keeper, and questions relating to the stability\r\nof the earth's axis and the constancy of the earth's rate of rotation\r\nare among those which it behoves the future to answer. Everywhere there\r\nis multiformity and change, stimulating a curiosity which the rapid\r\ndevelopment of methods of research offers the possibility of at least\r\npartially gratifying.\r\n\r\nOutside the solar system, the problems which demand a practical solution\r\nare virtually infinite in number and extent. And these have all arisen\r\nand crowded upon our thoughts within less than a hundred years. For\r\nsidereal science became a recognised branch of astronomy only through\r\nHerschel's discovery of the revolutions of double stars in 1802. Yet\r\nalready it may be, and has been called, \"the astronomy of the future,\"\r\nso rapidly has the development of a keen and universal interest attended\r\nand stimulated the growth of power to investigate this sublime subject.\r\nWhat has been done is little--is scarcely a beginning; yet it is much in\r\ncomparison with the total blank of a century past. And our knowledge\r\nwill, we are easily persuaded, appear in turn the merest ignorance to\r\nthose who come after us. Yet it is not to be despised, since by it we\r\nreach up groping fingers to touch the hem of the garment of the Most\r\nHigh.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1630: _Comptes Rendus_, t. xliv., p. 339.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1631: A.

In preparing the Second Edition, accordingly, I\r\nhave introduced extensive modifications. Considerable sections of the\r\nbook have been recast, and all have been thoroughly revised. New\r\nchapters have been inserted, old ones have been in large part\r\nsuppressed. Drastic measures of reform have, in short, been adopted,\r\nwith results that certainly import progress and (it is hoped) constitute\r\nimprovements. Most of the illustrations are entirely new; and I am under\r\ngreat obligations for the use of valuable photographs and drawings,\r\namong others, to Sir. David Gill, F.R.S., to Professor Hale and the\r\nUniversity Press of Chicago, to the Rev. W. Sidgreaves, S.J., to\r\nProfessors E. C. Pickering, Campbell, Barnard, and Frost, and to Dr. Max\r\nWolf of Heidelberg.\r\n\r\n     \"The work was admirable from the first, imparting the best\r\n     knowledge of a decade and a half ago; now it retains its high\r\n     quality by incorporating the newer knowledge.\"--_The Guardian_.\r\n\r\n     \"It has the remarkable feature of combining extraordinary profusion\r\n     of precise information with an elegance of literary style quite\r\n     unusual in scientific authors.\"--_The Academy_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         PUBLISHED BY\r\n\r\n          ADAM & CHARLES BLACK .

It aims at stimulating\r\nprogress along lines carefully marked out as immediately practicable.\r\nThe same author's \"History of Astronomy\" is a survey of the past;\r\n\"Problems in Astrophysics\" looks to the future. What we already know is\r\nregarded in it as means to the end of augmenting knowledge. Astrophysics\r\nis a science still at the outset of a magnificent career. Its ways are\r\nbeset with claimants for its attention. There is often much difficulty\r\nin choosing between them, yet rapidity of progress depends upon prudence\r\nin selection. Many hints for its guidance are accordingly offered in the\r\npresent work, which deals, so far as possible, with answerable\r\nquestions. It should, then, find its way into the hands of every\r\nastronomer who desires to keep up with the drift of thought, and to be\r\ninformed of the prospects of work and discovery in the various\r\ndepartments of research connected with the physics of the heavenly\r\nbodies.\"\r\n\r\n                     *SOME PRESS OPINIONS*\r\n\r\n\"The book shows every sign of profound and careful study, and the sense\r\nof scientific imagination, which is one of the greatest means of\r\nindependent discovery.\"--_St. James's Gazette._\r\n\r\n\"The book is written with all the charm that has characterised the\r\nauthoress's previous volumes, and contains a wealth of information and\r\nsuggestion for work yet to be accomplished which will appeal to all who\r\nare interested in the problems of the universe.\"--_Daily Telegraph._\r\n\r\n\"We feel that Miss Clerke has earned, and will surely receive, the\r\nadmiration and gratitude of astronomers for this new proof of her\r\ndevotion to their science.\"--_The Times._\r\n\r\n\r\n                      MODERN COSMOGONIES\r\n\r\n                  Crown 8vo.

The\r\ndifficulties besetting cosmical doctrines of evolution are pointed out\r\nin them, and the expedients are described by which those difficulties\r\nhave been met, though not wholly overcome. The widened possibilities\r\nconnected with the new science of radiology, the unification of the\r\nphysical forces that may ensue upon further discoveries concerning\r\nelectrical action, the function in the world of the impalpable ether,\r\nthe nature of gravity, are in turn discussed or adverted to; while the\r\nfinal chapter takes into consideration the crowning problem of life.\r\n\r\n\"These sixteen chapters are short studies on modern theories about the\r\norigin and mystery of the universe, by an astronomer whose writings have\r\ndone much to help and popularise that science.\"--_The Times._\r\n\r\n\r\n                          PUBLISHED BY\r\n\r\n            ADAM & CHARLES BLACK .
